00:00:23,639 --> 00:00:28,763
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, everyone, and welcome to your show, Method Happenings.

2
00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:36,649
[SPEAKER_00]: I am John Petrella, and this is a show far and about the city of Medford.

3
00:00:37,509 --> 00:00:47,376
[SPEAKER_00]: And the purpose of our program is to give Medford citizens facts and information that will help you make informed decisions.

4
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,142
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, we have a very special guest, Cheryl Rodriguez.

5
00:00:54,482 --> 00:01:01,964
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheryl will be speaking on facts you need to know about the Salem Street Project.

6
00:01:02,965 --> 00:01:04,105
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the show.

7
00:01:04,605 --> 00:01:08,887
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for joining us on Method Happenings.

8
00:01:10,287 --> 00:01:11,067
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.

9
00:01:13,088 --> 00:01:15,789
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we're going to get right into the questions with Cheryl.

10
00:01:17,975 --> 00:01:30,698
[SPEAKER_00]: The first question is, as you know, Cheryl, the city made a significant investment in the comprehensive plan, which was completed in 2023.

11
00:01:31,499 --> 00:01:35,019
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe we have a graphic of that development area.

12
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:44,882
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess my first question is, what exactly is the vision for Salem Street as part of the comprehensive plan?

13
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:55,485
[SPEAKER_01]: The vision for Salem Street seems to be to transform the area into a corridor that will be filled with dense, tall apartment buildings.

14
00:01:57,466 --> 00:02:00,169
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what studies?

15
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:08,896
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if they're just going to do dense, tall apartment buildings on Salem Street, it's already congested, as we all know.

16
00:02:09,316 --> 00:02:11,978
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone who travels, anyone who lives in the area,

17
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:14,111
[SPEAKER_00]: knows that.

18
00:02:14,471 --> 00:02:15,974
[SPEAKER_00]: So what studies?

19
00:02:16,114 --> 00:02:17,536
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, did they do studies?

20
00:02:17,696 --> 00:02:19,419
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a developer in charge?

21
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:24,306
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what about oversight on a project this big?

22
00:02:25,676 --> 00:02:27,177
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything about that?

23
00:02:27,798 --> 00:02:46,268
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately for us, even though the comprehensive plan calls for clear studies about traffic, parking, infrastructure, none of those studies have happened, and we're being informed by an urgency for developers who are waiting to pull permits and build on that corridor and want to build the most that they can.

24
00:02:47,989 --> 00:02:48,269
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

25
00:02:48,309 --> 00:02:54,153
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I think we also have a graphic map of the corridor.

26
00:02:55,054 --> 00:02:57,395
[SPEAKER_00]: and a map of the intersection we're discussing.

27
00:02:59,815 --> 00:03:13,279
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess my next question, is there any way, I mean, can you speak to the amount of investment the city will be required to make in the Salem Street corridor?

28
00:03:14,899 --> 00:03:18,360
[SPEAKER_00]: And why is it being made attractive to the developer?

29
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,161
[SPEAKER_00]: What's being done, basically?

30
00:03:20,962 --> 00:03:26,384
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the incentive that the city is offering is that they're reducing the lot size to build an apartment building by 70%.

31
00:03:27,804 --> 00:03:49,072
[SPEAKER_01]: So for what half of the land required for a single or two-family home will now be able to hold up to a six-story apartment building without the need for any variances, setbacks, and they're going to require or hope that the developer will allow them to build a 12-foot sidewalk using a piece of their land.

32
00:03:50,812 --> 00:03:52,233
[SPEAKER_00]: So, okay.

33
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:55,877
[SPEAKER_00]: So, who's in charge, I guess?

34
00:03:56,217 --> 00:03:56,958
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's in charge?

35
00:03:57,038 --> 00:03:58,399
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's making these decisions?

36
00:03:59,059 --> 00:04:00,461
[SPEAKER_00]: Did they go to the neighborhood?

37
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:04,945
[SPEAKER_00]: Did they inform the neighborhood of what exactly is going to take place here?

38
00:04:05,405 --> 00:04:07,467
[SPEAKER_00]: Does the neighborhood have any say?

39
00:04:07,487 --> 00:04:11,230
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the city council's involved.

40
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:12,932
[SPEAKER_00]: I know this committee's involved.

41
00:04:13,672 --> 00:04:14,253
[SPEAKER_00]: Meetings.

42
00:04:16,192 --> 00:04:17,895
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they getting announcements out?

43
00:04:18,036 --> 00:04:21,602
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what exactly are they doing to let people know?

44
00:04:21,642 --> 00:04:22,825
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, people live there.

45
00:04:23,326 --> 00:04:26,712
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure they want to know what's going to happen, what's going on in the area.

46
00:04:27,593 --> 00:04:31,934
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, the community has not been given the benefit of any community meetings.

47
00:04:32,475 --> 00:04:39,037
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, the meetings that the planning committee is having usually have the agenda item of update from Innes Associates.

48
00:04:39,657 --> 00:04:52,901
[SPEAKER_01]: And the meetings themselves seem to be driven by the director of our planning department, Alicia Hunt, who is intent on making sure that the developers don't go ahead and build something that they may find too small.

49
00:04:54,162 --> 00:04:54,782
[SPEAKER_00]: Too small.

50
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,491
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say that again.

51
00:04:57,871 --> 00:04:59,012
[SPEAKER_00]: You're saying too small.

52
00:04:59,952 --> 00:05:00,453
[SPEAKER_00]: Too small.

53
00:05:00,473 --> 00:05:06,096
[SPEAKER_01]: They've decided 35 feet is not enough height for Salem Street and the surrounding side streets.

54
00:05:08,177 --> 00:05:11,239
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing I read, I'm going to read it right here.

55
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:27,051
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I'm gonna ask you can I know this the traffic there now you got the school there it's a busy street a very busy street because I get out at sometimes and I sit in traffic.

56
00:05:27,211 --> 00:05:37,379
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's Kind of crazy by Park Street the beginning after the rotary So they're gonna build all these buildings and

57
00:05:39,428 --> 00:05:41,449
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at this, and I'm reading it right off.

58
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:42,470
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from them.

59
00:05:43,171 --> 00:05:46,313
[SPEAKER_00]: It says 0.8 autos per unit.

60
00:05:46,353 --> 00:05:49,255
[SPEAKER_00]: What is 0.8 auto?

61
00:05:49,715 --> 00:05:51,736
[SPEAKER_00]: An automobile, 0.8.

62
00:05:52,357 --> 00:06:01,202
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in 2022, a developer did a traffic study there, and they found around 18,000 cars go down Salem Street a day, close to 2,000 on Park Street.

63
00:06:01,923 --> 00:06:07,726
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're going to build 0.8 parking spaces per unit as an incentive to bring in developers

64
00:06:08,707 --> 00:06:14,111
[SPEAKER_01]: without having conducted a parking or a traffic study in that area at all.

65
00:06:14,151 --> 00:06:16,593
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to leave it up to the individual buildings.

66
00:06:17,813 --> 00:06:21,016
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know how tough it is to park there now.

67
00:06:22,096 --> 00:06:25,078
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to live there to understand that.

68
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,681
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're going to bring in all these buildings.

69
00:06:29,582 --> 00:06:30,882
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have zero.

70
00:06:31,243 --> 00:06:34,725
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to allow them, I guess for every unit, you can have 0.8 car.

71
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,501
[SPEAKER_00]: What are they going to do in the winter?

72
00:06:39,721 --> 00:06:41,442
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, where are people going to park?

73
00:06:42,242 --> 00:06:57,250
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, interestingly enough, if you bring up the graphic for the Salem Street neighborhood known that just focuses on the Salem and Park intersection, you'll see that right in that area, they are primed to add probably 350 plus apartments.

74
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:01,372
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Medford average is two cars per unit.

75
00:07:03,753 --> 00:07:04,974
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're planning 0.8.

76
00:07:05,454 --> 00:07:14,059
[SPEAKER_01]: So conservatively, we're talking about 350 new cars coming onto that small area with restricted parking already.

77
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:15,199
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

78
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:20,002
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know, I don't see many buses.

79
00:07:21,623 --> 00:07:24,464
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, are they trying to get people to take the bus over there?

80
00:07:26,074 --> 00:07:31,697
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the most frequent bus you'll see on Salem Street is the non-in-service because they're on their way back to the T-Garage.

81
00:07:32,137 --> 00:07:35,099
[SPEAKER_01]: But we do have one bus that will be changing its route.

82
00:07:35,799 --> 00:07:41,902
[SPEAKER_01]: And the MBTA has already informed the city that that bus will not run on time unless a bus lane is added.

83
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:46,685
[SPEAKER_01]: But physically, the street is not wide enough to hold a bus lane and two-way traffic.

84
00:07:47,505 --> 00:07:48,546
[SPEAKER_00]: No, absolutely not.

85
00:07:48,846 --> 00:07:52,688
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't picture the way it is now, a bus lane.

86
00:07:52,948 --> 00:07:55,450
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they can't be serious.

87
00:07:58,576 --> 00:08:00,316
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm lost.

88
00:08:00,456 --> 00:08:09,598
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is there the need for a bus, I guess it's going to Tufts College, or what's the need for that?

89
00:08:09,679 --> 00:08:11,239
[SPEAKER_00]: Why change the bus?

90
00:08:11,299 --> 00:08:11,839
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get it.

91
00:08:12,499 --> 00:08:17,440
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the MBTA is doing a consolidation plan, so they're trying to shift some of the bus routes.

92
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:24,702
[SPEAKER_01]: So now instead of the bus going from Malden Center to Sullivan Station, when the new change comes in, it'll go from Revere

93
00:08:25,702 --> 00:08:36,145
[SPEAKER_01]: to Union Square, so it's going to pass by Tufts, which is going to harm a lot of people who currently work at Assembly Row and will no longer have access to that area from Salem Street.

94
00:08:36,185 --> 00:08:38,946
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, and there are a lot of people that work at Assembly Row.

95
00:08:38,986 --> 00:08:40,387
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a couple of them myself.

96
00:08:41,207 --> 00:08:43,788
[SPEAKER_00]: So that bus that they normally take is just going away.

97
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:46,469
[SPEAKER_01]: Going away, the same thing that happened to the commuter bus.

98
00:08:47,479 --> 00:08:53,502
[SPEAKER_01]: we're no longer going to have access to those transportation options, but we're going to have less parking too.

99
00:08:53,842 --> 00:08:54,042
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

100
00:08:54,503 --> 00:09:00,566
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess what, what is this doing for the city?

101
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:04,088
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the incentive for the people that live there?

102
00:09:05,048 --> 00:09:06,089
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the incentive?

103
00:09:06,209 --> 00:09:11,872
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we have a graphic, uh, on the incentives as well, but I mean, the bottom line is,

104
00:09:13,493 --> 00:09:14,634
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the incentive?

105
00:09:15,014 --> 00:09:16,596
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the city getting from this?

106
00:09:17,176 --> 00:09:18,518
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the neighborhood getting?

107
00:09:18,738 --> 00:09:20,179
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we getting anything out of this?

108
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:26,605
[SPEAKER_00]: Aside from congestion, I mean, the bus lane, we know that's going to be going away.

109
00:09:26,665 --> 00:09:30,529
[SPEAKER_00]: And not the bus lane, the bus itself is changing routes.

110
00:09:31,189 --> 00:09:34,172
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's got to be some positive somewhere.

111
00:09:34,192 --> 00:09:35,714
[SPEAKER_00]: There's got to be something they're giving us.

112
00:09:37,038 --> 00:09:45,564
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they feel that it's a positive that they're giving us dense housing with limited parking to discourage people from owning vehicles.

113
00:09:46,004 --> 00:09:56,092
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, the transportation options available for this area are so limited that I think people who now live there without cars are probably going to find themselves needing a car.

114
00:09:57,584 --> 00:10:10,253
[SPEAKER_01]: And the incentives that they're asking for to increase height on a building, a fountain, a park bench, are not actually incentives for the community and are just an excuse to allow them to build higher buildings.

115
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:12,174
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it.

116
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:23,041
[SPEAKER_00]: The zoning, everything's just going to change and they're going to let them go up four stories, five stories?

117
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:25,923
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the situation on the height of the buildings?

118
00:10:26,323 --> 00:10:29,464
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, currently, buildings are allowed to go up to 35 feet.

119
00:10:30,184 --> 00:10:34,926
[SPEAKER_01]: And with this new zoning, the minimum will now be 40, can be 42 feet.

120
00:10:35,326 --> 00:10:36,047
[SPEAKER_01]: We can go up to

121
00:10:38,293 --> 00:10:42,779
[SPEAKER_01]: 54 feet or even as high as 78 feet without needing any kind of variances.

122
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,862
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all going to be site plan review.

123
00:10:45,243 --> 00:10:54,096
[SPEAKER_01]: So they just go in and they say what they want and hopefully for them, they just get granted it without any community notification needed.

124
00:10:55,479 --> 00:11:02,943
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could be living in a house, your family could be in a house on one of those streets and the next thing you know there's going to be a six story or a five story building.

125
00:11:03,643 --> 00:11:07,045
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't have to, no variances, no nothing, just smack it up.

126
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:13,869
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately for two residents that live next to the vacant hole at 290 Salem Street, those single family homes.

127
00:11:14,809 --> 00:11:32,516
[SPEAKER_01]: The only buffer that they require for those small homes is a 5-foot landscaped buffer and an 8-foot tall fence, and there are no further setbacks on the sides or the rear required for these buildings, which can now occupy 80 percent of the lot.

128
00:11:32,797 --> 00:11:35,178
[SPEAKER_01]: From 40 to 50 percent, they're now allowed 80 percent.

129
00:11:36,688 --> 00:11:39,369
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a huge change for people living in that area.

130
00:11:40,029 --> 00:11:40,630
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course it is.

131
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:41,830
[SPEAKER_00]: So five feet.

132
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:44,191
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you're at home, get it.

133
00:11:44,331 --> 00:11:47,052
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I wish I brought my tape measure, but five feet.

134
00:11:47,272 --> 00:11:47,693
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.

135
00:11:47,993 --> 00:11:48,853
[SPEAKER_00]: Five feet's nothing.

136
00:11:49,233 --> 00:11:51,014
[SPEAKER_00]: It's less than the length of a folding table.

137
00:11:51,034 --> 00:11:51,294
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

138
00:11:51,374 --> 00:11:54,175
[SPEAKER_00]: It's five feet.

139
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:57,276
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, it's, that's incredible.

140
00:11:57,497 --> 00:11:58,137
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is.

141
00:11:58,537 --> 00:11:59,657
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is incredible.

142
00:12:00,818 --> 00:12:03,959
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess, you know, the next question, um,

143
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:23,966
[SPEAKER_00]: comes across in my mind is, you know, besides the emphasis on housing, does the project identify, you know, how it will generate, I guess, economic growth?

144
00:12:25,931 --> 00:12:28,112
[SPEAKER_00]: increase city revenues in the future.

145
00:12:28,172 --> 00:12:29,594
[SPEAKER_00]: Is any of that in the plan?

146
00:12:31,015 --> 00:12:40,923
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, the neighbors aren't gonna get too much out of this, unless they make some drastic changes, which doesn't look like it's gonna happen, but we'll discuss that later.

147
00:12:42,604 --> 00:12:44,886
[SPEAKER_00]: What about the economic growth?

148
00:12:46,507 --> 00:12:49,670
[SPEAKER_00]: We just went through the override, so what benefit

149
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:54,322
[SPEAKER_00]: is the city, the entire city, going to get out?

150
00:12:54,542 --> 00:12:55,983
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the revenue increase?

151
00:12:56,023 --> 00:13:00,785
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any discussion on that or what we're going to see?

152
00:13:01,106 --> 00:13:06,609
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they're calling these mixed-use districts, so they're wanting there to be first floor commercial.

153
00:13:06,909 --> 00:13:12,092
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you read the zoning, you find that you don't actually have to provide any commercial.

154
00:13:12,132 --> 00:13:18,035
[SPEAKER_01]: You can, by right, just build a straight-up apartment building with zero economic development.

155
00:13:19,122 --> 00:13:20,803
[SPEAKER_01]: at all in the whole building.

156
00:13:20,923 --> 00:13:23,746
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's getting back to something you said earlier.

157
00:13:25,707 --> 00:13:27,228
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to require them.

158
00:13:28,109 --> 00:13:35,095
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're going to go up four stories on Salem Street, they're not going to require a business to be on the first floor.

159
00:13:35,635 --> 00:13:36,796
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no requirement.

160
00:13:36,896 --> 00:13:44,242
[SPEAKER_01]: And even to call it mixed use, if you put in a lobby that's just for the residents of the building, they're calling that mixed use.

161
00:13:45,698 --> 00:13:48,440
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just wonderful.

162
00:13:51,342 --> 00:14:14,137
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, the other thing, another subject you hear about it all the time, you know, what other elements, you know, of this comprehensive plan, you know, public services, mobility, open spaces, history, culture, you hear that brought up

163
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,201
[SPEAKER_00]: All the time.

164
00:14:18,285 --> 00:14:19,327
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on with that?

165
00:14:20,338 --> 00:14:38,803
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, unfortunately, uh, the planning committee has decided that rezoning urgently for developers is more important than heat islands, so, which is why they're requiring 12-foot sidewalks and 80% lot coverage in an area that already suffers from heat islands.

166
00:14:39,163 --> 00:14:48,726
[SPEAKER_01]: They're also not pausing to make any kind of affordability plan for this corridor because the need for any housing is more urgent than

167
00:14:49,781 --> 00:15:01,104
[SPEAKER_01]: the need to take the time to plan to make sure we gain affordable housing on these already extremely small lots that will not naturally produce affordable housing.

168
00:15:01,825 --> 00:15:02,785
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not.

169
00:15:04,806 --> 00:15:05,566
[SPEAKER_00]: We know we need it.

170
00:15:05,606 --> 00:15:06,826
[SPEAKER_00]: We need affordable housing.

171
00:15:07,266 --> 00:15:12,688
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're going to let them, whoever, I don't know who the developers are and developers, you know, God, God bless them.

172
00:15:12,948 --> 00:15:15,889
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they got to earn a living and, and that's fine.

173
00:15:16,089 --> 00:15:16,249
[SPEAKER_00]: But,

174
00:15:18,771 --> 00:15:25,573
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't understand how they're just going to, they're going to allow them to basically walk in and just, you know, four, five, six stories.

175
00:15:29,274 --> 00:15:35,556
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't understand the basic simple premise.

176
00:15:35,656 --> 00:15:38,617
[SPEAKER_00]: Before, you know, this is the city of Medford.

177
00:15:39,317 --> 00:15:48,160
[SPEAKER_00]: You allow someone or whoever it is, I don't know, to come in and they're going to, they're going to basically change a neighborhood, this comprehensive plan, okay?

178
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:56,525
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how much, it sounds like the neighborhood did not have, or the people that lived there did not have much input.

179
00:15:57,485 --> 00:15:59,647
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounded like they didn't have a lot of meetings.

180
00:16:01,328 --> 00:16:13,355
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just don't understand, I can't find benefits, I can't find incentives for the people.

181
00:16:13,796 --> 00:16:18,679
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're gonna do something in the city, the neighbors, whatever, it's gotta benefit the city.

182
00:16:20,118 --> 00:16:27,505
[SPEAKER_00]: They haven't even discussed anything, the benefits, the amount, you know, tax dollars, I don't know, something.

183
00:16:27,565 --> 00:16:29,967
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything that they're discussing?

184
00:16:30,588 --> 00:16:38,875
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, even just the name of this zoning, the Salem Street Corridor District, it takes away the fact that there are neighborhoods here.

185
00:16:38,995 --> 00:16:40,817
[SPEAKER_01]: These are very dense neighborhoods.

186
00:16:40,857 --> 00:16:45,401
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an environmental justice neighborhood with a large amount of people who are not

187
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:58,650
[SPEAKER_01]: citizens, their residents who may not speak English, a lot of lower income people live here, people who don't have time to scour the city website to look and see what is actually happening.

188
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:07,716
[SPEAKER_01]: And the bulk of this happened during the month of December, which is a very busy month for most people, and people are not listening to four-hour

189
00:17:08,216 --> 00:17:25,300
[SPEAKER_01]: planning committee meetings to see if the street near their home is being mentioned and being changed in such a dramatic way because there's a fundamental belief that if they're going to do something this dramatic to my neighborhood, surely they will notify us.

190
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:26,140
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll let us know.

191
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,660
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll come out to the community.

192
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,600
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll meet with us.

193
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,881
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll take in our input and then inform the zoning.

194
00:17:32,141 --> 00:17:34,161
[SPEAKER_01]: But unfortunately, that's not what happened.

195
00:17:35,202 --> 00:17:36,322
[SPEAKER_01]: So none of that took place?

196
00:17:37,903 --> 00:17:52,231
[SPEAKER_01]: No, the meetings happened with one to two people in the room and they just kept moving forward and saying that they had all the community input they needed in 2022 and they were working on the comprehensive plan.

197
00:17:53,271 --> 00:17:54,512
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was their answer.

198
00:17:54,552 --> 00:17:55,993
[SPEAKER_00]: They had all the community input.

199
00:17:57,553 --> 00:18:02,756
[SPEAKER_00]: So in other words, they're moving ahead with the input they had from 2022.

200
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:05,211
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

201
00:18:05,431 --> 00:18:10,914
[SPEAKER_01]: Interestingly enough, the input from 2022 on Salem Street was, the traffic is terrible here.

202
00:18:11,874 --> 00:18:13,255
[SPEAKER_01]: This street is a nightmare.

203
00:18:13,815 --> 00:18:22,279
[SPEAKER_01]: Alicia Hunt herself said, even when I had children in the Roberts, I refused to drive on Salem Street because Salem Street is terrible.

204
00:18:24,667 --> 00:18:29,150
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know where they got, you know, that'd be a great place to put a couple thousand apartments.

205
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:29,510
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

206
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:29,890
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

207
00:18:30,171 --> 00:18:32,372
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, that's back in 2022.

208
00:18:32,732 --> 00:18:37,335
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, I honestly, um, it's a lot worse to traffic there now.

209
00:18:38,396 --> 00:18:39,997
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it really is.

210
00:18:40,097 --> 00:18:42,519
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tough getting up and down Salem street.

211
00:18:43,199 --> 00:18:50,904
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just, you know, my mind doesn't see how you can add all this housing or whatever you want to call it apartments.

212
00:18:52,045 --> 00:18:52,165
[SPEAKER_00]: And,

213
00:18:54,523 --> 00:18:56,323
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's just so much involved here.

214
00:18:56,623 --> 00:19:04,865
[SPEAKER_00]: The traffic, the fire department, I mean, do they have the equipment to handle another 20, 30 buildings or 10 buildings or two buildings up there?

215
00:19:06,046 --> 00:19:20,309
[SPEAKER_01]: From a brief conversation I had with the fire department, they do not have the equipment nor the manpower to handle a corridor full of 42 to 78 foot skinny, no space between apartment buildings.

216
00:19:20,329 --> 00:19:20,469
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

217
00:19:21,269 --> 00:19:21,489
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

218
00:19:21,609 --> 00:19:22,709
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what the plan is.

219
00:19:22,729 --> 00:19:27,070
[SPEAKER_00]: And you, you spoke to the fire department, I take it, or someone from the fire department.

220
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:33,852
[SPEAKER_01]: I did speak to a member of the fire department and they said they didn't know why they were not brought into this conversation.

221
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:34,592
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

222
00:19:34,672 --> 00:19:35,773
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that doesn't make sense.

223
00:19:35,933 --> 00:19:38,173
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, did they have enough fire hydrants?

224
00:19:38,253 --> 00:19:39,234
[SPEAKER_00]: It just, I don't know.

225
00:19:39,294 --> 00:19:43,915
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like this is a project that wasn't well thought out, put it that way.

226
00:19:44,555 --> 00:19:48,736
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it seems like they're just moving forward with it because it's, uh,

227
00:19:50,832 --> 00:19:52,613
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, for no other reason.

228
00:19:52,633 --> 00:19:59,040
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're just going to move forward with something that the neighborhood, I would think the neighborhood doesn't want this.

229
00:20:00,123 --> 00:20:18,996
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I know you're very involved with this, and the city should be thankful for that, because you take the time, you went through, you got your facts straight, you got your information, and I see a lot of your information, facts are posted.

230
00:20:19,016 --> 00:20:22,859
[SPEAKER_00]: I do read them on different, various sites.

231
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,682
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, thank you for doing all this,

232
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:36,684
[SPEAKER_00]: But it just seems like, I mean, they're just gonna like plow through with this regardless.

233
00:20:37,665 --> 00:20:39,206
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the way you feel?

234
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:48,051
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I've definitely been thrust into the role of the town crier, like, look over here, this something big is happening and, and you're gonna miss it.

235
00:20:48,632 --> 00:20:53,395
[SPEAKER_01]: And it feels like I'm coming against a city council that seems to be run by activists.

236
00:20:53,695 --> 00:20:57,197
[SPEAKER_01]: They're using the mindset of we need housing now with

237
00:20:57,337 --> 00:21:00,939
[SPEAKER_01]: without hesitation, without pause for study.

238
00:21:00,979 --> 00:21:03,061
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not what our government should be writing.

239
00:21:03,261 --> 00:21:14,768
[SPEAKER_01]: Our government should be saying, we do in fact need housing, but we need to do studies and inform the housing that we build so that we don't overwhelm an area or create the wrong type of housing.

240
00:21:15,048 --> 00:21:19,031
[SPEAKER_01]: Does Medford need this much more luxury housing?

241
00:21:19,231 --> 00:21:26,436
[SPEAKER_01]: If every one of those buildings only has nine units in it, that will be a net of zero affordable units.

242
00:21:26,936 --> 00:21:36,786
[SPEAKER_01]: Will that benefit a community where we have thousands of families that need an affordable unit and we're only creating luxury units?

243
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:43,713
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to be honest, I don't see too many families

244
00:21:44,933 --> 00:21:46,935
[SPEAKER_00]: moving into these units, put it that way.

245
00:21:47,616 --> 00:21:52,001
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they did, I mean, if you have someone move in with a kid or two, what about the school?

246
00:21:52,242 --> 00:21:55,185
[SPEAKER_00]: How is the school gonna, is that in the plan?

247
00:21:57,568 --> 00:22:01,853
[SPEAKER_00]: What the results are gonna be if you add so many students in a year or two?

248
00:22:02,293 --> 00:22:09,237
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you do research on these units, you'll find that about 25% of these units have one or more schoolchildren.

249
00:22:09,558 --> 00:22:12,439
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not something that was presented by the city council.

250
00:22:12,499 --> 00:22:24,206
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something that if you do research into the type of housing that's being built and the fact that there aren't homes for all of these families to live in, so they're living in apartments.

251
00:22:25,207 --> 00:22:34,012
[SPEAKER_01]: which is not the same as has always been and the schools that they're planning to feed these children into are already very full.

252
00:22:34,272 --> 00:22:38,815
[SPEAKER_01]: They're high five hundreds and they're only made for 600 children.

253
00:22:39,095 --> 00:22:39,355
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

254
00:22:40,195 --> 00:22:51,422
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, you know, not to get into anything else, another thing, but I drive by Mr. Gav every day and I just, you know, there's so many empty, um,

255
00:22:52,442 --> 00:22:55,203
[SPEAKER_00]: Spots over there put it that way the fouls way.

256
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:58,084
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean Commercial areas.

257
00:22:58,104 --> 00:22:59,044
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I call them.

258
00:23:00,905 --> 00:23:04,886
[SPEAKER_00]: I Just don't understand Why they're pushing this on Salem Street.

259
00:23:05,326 --> 00:23:16,369
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't And it's great that yeah, you know, you're doing something about it but uh You know listening to you it appears the city.

260
00:23:16,389 --> 00:23:20,791
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean will not get what was promised

261
00:23:23,047 --> 00:23:29,130
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess, is there anything to modify the direction of Salem Street?

262
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:33,211
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any meetings?

263
00:23:33,291 --> 00:23:34,852
[SPEAKER_00]: Are the residents trying it?

264
00:23:34,972 --> 00:23:42,615
[SPEAKER_00]: Is anything going on to try and get the city council or whoever this planning committee is

265
00:23:43,933 --> 00:23:46,034
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't believe they're listening.

266
00:23:46,694 --> 00:23:55,877
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure why they wouldn't listen, but is there anything planned or going on that might get them to modify this?

267
00:23:55,957 --> 00:24:12,603
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also, I think we have a graphic, you know, of Park and Salem Street, but back to the question, is there anything you think going on that might modify or change their opinion or get a second look or?

268
00:24:13,464 --> 00:24:18,031
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, maybe the whole community can get together and, you know, decide what they want.

269
00:24:19,326 --> 00:24:24,129
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately for us, this plan is on the urgent track and moving very quickly.

270
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:25,810
[SPEAKER_01]: There are two meetings.

271
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:38,879
[SPEAKER_01]: They've already advertised the final meeting when they plan to vote this through, so there's a meeting on February 5th, which is the continuation of the Community Development Board meeting, and that is being held on Zoom only.

272
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:47,004
[SPEAKER_01]: The final vote is set to be taken on February 11th at the City Council meeting at 7 o'clock at City Hall, and

273
00:24:47,905 --> 00:24:49,226
[SPEAKER_01]: people need to speak up.

274
00:24:49,466 --> 00:24:51,347
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to start emailing Councilors.

275
00:24:51,387 --> 00:24:52,727
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to email the mayor.

276
00:24:52,807 --> 00:24:55,229
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to email the Community Development Board.

277
00:24:55,509 --> 00:25:02,312
[SPEAKER_01]: And they need to tell them to pause and appropriately study this zoning before they push it through.

278
00:25:02,772 --> 00:25:06,654
[SPEAKER_01]: The consequences for the neighborhood if they don't could be significant.

279
00:25:09,335 --> 00:25:13,878
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like, you know, I'm going to remind the people watching the show

280
00:25:15,092 --> 00:25:23,522
[SPEAKER_00]: that February 5th, it's a Zoom meeting only, and on February 11th, I take it that's City Council meeting?

281
00:25:24,383 --> 00:25:24,543
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

282
00:25:24,603 --> 00:25:26,325
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to be the final vote?

283
00:25:27,066 --> 00:25:27,827
[SPEAKER_00]: That will be the final vote.

284
00:25:27,847 --> 00:25:28,327
[SPEAKER_00]: February 11th.

285
00:25:28,347 --> 00:25:29,128
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty close.

286
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:30,490
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's too close.

287
00:25:31,015 --> 00:25:35,136
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can guarantee you there are permits ready to be submitted as soon as that zoning is live.

288
00:25:35,196 --> 00:25:37,417
[SPEAKER_01]: We have an open pit at 290 Salem Street.

289
00:25:37,997 --> 00:25:43,718
[SPEAKER_01]: In the Park Street graphic, there are five parcels that are owned by one developer.

290
00:25:43,998 --> 00:25:48,240
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's six parcels that could be ready to go by spring.

291
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:57,162
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it just sounds like the City Council, to me anyhow, and this is, you know,

292
00:25:58,245 --> 00:26:21,835
[SPEAKER_00]: my opinion, but it just seems like they're, you know, the mayor, the city council, this planning board, I mean, it just seems like they're rushing to implement policies like quickly, you know, rather than, I guess the word is properly.

293
00:26:23,051 --> 00:26:26,592
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a rush to add housing, but we're not doing it strategically.

294
00:26:26,992 --> 00:26:31,713
[SPEAKER_01]: If we go back to the comprehensive plan, there are specific studies that are called for.

295
00:26:32,073 --> 00:26:36,334
[SPEAKER_01]: There's guidelines and things that you're supposed to do to try to prevent displacement.

296
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:41,615
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an environmental justice neighborhood, and it's not the only neighborhood they're planning to go to.

297
00:26:41,675 --> 00:26:43,116
[SPEAKER_01]: They're planning to go to Boston Ave.

298
00:26:43,156 --> 00:26:48,717
[SPEAKER_01]: They're planning to go to Main Street, which are also environmental justice areas, and push more density on them.

299
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:52,618
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are only the environmental justice neighborhoods

300
00:26:53,779 --> 00:27:03,169
[SPEAKER_01]: that are already very dense being targeted for such increased density while other neighborhoods are preserved at low density, untouched.

301
00:27:07,445 --> 00:27:11,326
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be going to other high-density areas in the city?

302
00:27:12,006 --> 00:27:12,546
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

303
00:27:13,246 --> 00:27:17,648
[SPEAKER_01]: Boston Ave and Main Street have already been identified as corridors by the planning committee.

304
00:27:18,948 --> 00:27:20,568
[SPEAKER_00]: Boston Ave, of all places.

305
00:27:21,128 --> 00:27:21,469
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

306
00:27:21,969 --> 00:27:23,209
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I can say to that.

307
00:27:23,529 --> 00:27:27,050
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone that's been down Boston Ave knows it's a parking lot most of the time.

308
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:27,250
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.

309
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:28,230
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.

310
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:30,931
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've lived... Main Street's not much better.

311
00:27:31,291 --> 00:27:34,132
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up in South Method, and I tell you, it's pretty...

312
00:27:35,672 --> 00:27:39,595
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an extremely different neighborhood, which is fine.

313
00:27:40,276 --> 00:27:49,082
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing wrong with that, but I just can't see, you know, bad enough Salem Street, but now they're going to try and do it down in South Method.

314
00:27:49,162 --> 00:27:54,326
[SPEAKER_00]: I just hope the whole city, you know, you've done a lot of work on this.

315
00:27:54,366 --> 00:27:55,607
[SPEAKER_00]: You've done a lot of good work.

316
00:27:57,519 --> 00:27:58,299
[SPEAKER_00]: It's facts.

317
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,301
[SPEAKER_00]: It's solid information.

318
00:28:02,402 --> 00:28:07,126
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know you're sort of being made out to be the bad guy, but we know you can take it.

319
00:28:07,206 --> 00:28:12,250
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, good for you that you're doing this.

320
00:28:14,532 --> 00:28:19,876
[SPEAKER_00]: And once again, remember, there's two meetings coming up, okay?

321
00:28:19,956 --> 00:28:21,016
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was February 5th.

322
00:28:22,461 --> 00:28:33,904
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other one, which I guess is the final, February 11th, City Hall, the Council, they're going to vote on it, and that's it.

323
00:28:35,064 --> 00:28:38,385
[SPEAKER_00]: So once they vote on it, there's no fighting it, there's no nothing.

324
00:28:38,465 --> 00:28:41,526
[SPEAKER_01]: We know there's six members that are in favor, and they're ready to go.

325
00:28:41,586 --> 00:28:45,547
[SPEAKER_01]: They want their housing on Sale Street, and they want to move on to the next street.

326
00:28:46,287 --> 00:28:47,988
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if it was affordable housing,

327
00:28:48,921 --> 00:29:00,609
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see, you know, doing something for affordable housing, but, you know, I just don't see what the city of Medford, what is the benefit?

328
00:29:00,789 --> 00:29:02,110
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we getting out of it?

329
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:05,453
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the question that my mind, that's how my mind works.

330
00:29:06,431 --> 00:29:26,380
[SPEAKER_00]: business welcome, great, you want to open a business, we love you, come to Method, you know, anything that will help, you know, we just had overrides, we got people, all kinds of problems, you know, with, you know, with this, it is a tax burden, they don't want to use those words, but, I mean, the override is affecting people.

331
00:29:28,361 --> 00:29:29,302
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just,

332
00:29:30,323 --> 00:29:40,417
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if this was going to benefit Medford, it just doesn't seem to be doing anything financially for the neighborhood, for the city.

333
00:29:41,258 --> 00:29:42,079
[SPEAKER_01]: It's doing something.

334
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:45,644
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, what it's doing is rapidly gentrifying the area.

335
00:29:47,582 --> 00:29:49,043
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to price people out.

336
00:29:49,183 --> 00:29:52,225
[SPEAKER_01]: People are not going to be able to live here.

337
00:29:52,325 --> 00:29:54,846
[SPEAKER_01]: People are not going to be able to get to work because the bus is changing.

338
00:29:54,886 --> 00:29:57,087
[SPEAKER_01]: People are going to need places to park.

339
00:29:57,468 --> 00:30:01,750
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to be touring the area looking for a parking space when you get home from work.

340
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:03,011
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be

341
00:30:03,831 --> 00:30:04,192
[SPEAKER_01]: a mess.

342
00:30:04,252 --> 00:30:21,395
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is not a it could happen, this is we have developers who are ready to build, according to Alicia Hunt, they are ready to pull permits, and if they don't urgently pass this zoning, then the buildings may be smaller than the planning committee and the planning department would like.

343
00:30:21,855 --> 00:30:24,297
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's no regard for current residents.

344
00:30:24,337 --> 00:30:31,484
[SPEAKER_01]: There's little regard for future residents as they're not planning any huge infrastructure or parking upgrades for them.

345
00:30:31,784 --> 00:30:43,254
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just an assumption that people won't have children and won't have cars, which is not a realistic assumption to base zoning an entire area on.

346
00:30:43,615 --> 00:30:44,415
[SPEAKER_01]: We need studies.

347
00:30:45,436 --> 00:30:48,019
[SPEAKER_01]: We need them now, before this is passed.

348
00:30:49,270 --> 00:31:04,813
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, I could talk to you for another two hours on this subject, and I'm hoping that the people that are listening, that are watching the show, you know, you gained something out of this.

349
00:31:05,513 --> 00:31:09,273
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're putting forth very important information.

350
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:11,594
[SPEAKER_00]: We're putting out, it's factual.

351
00:31:12,294 --> 00:31:17,035
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheryl has done her homework, and she's been a,

352
00:31:18,387 --> 00:31:22,411
[SPEAKER_00]: a leader in this and, you know, thank God for her.

353
00:31:22,551 --> 00:31:26,734
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, she's fighting for us and that's always a great thing.

354
00:31:29,803 --> 00:31:32,606
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we'll probably have you back on the show again, Cheryl.

355
00:31:33,486 --> 00:31:37,390
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that you want to be, but can't thank you enough for joining us.

356
00:31:39,111 --> 00:31:40,773
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a pleasure having you on.

357
00:31:41,533 --> 00:31:44,436
[SPEAKER_00]: I see we're running late on time.

358
00:31:45,136 --> 00:31:57,087
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to thank you, Cheryl, for sharing information and facts that people need to understand on this Salem Street Corridor project.

359
00:31:57,965 --> 00:32:06,506
[SPEAKER_00]: You will be able to see replays of this show on Method Community Media, YouTube, Method Happenings.

360
00:32:07,307 --> 00:32:22,489
[SPEAKER_00]: For more information about our future program, you can visit either the Method Community Network at mcno2155.com or allmethod.com.

361
00:32:23,269 --> 00:32:26,810
[SPEAKER_00]: For Method Happenings, I'm John Petrella.

362
00:32:27,974 --> 00:32:32,485
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, thank you, Cheryl, and please stay informed.
