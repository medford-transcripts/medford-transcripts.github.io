1
00:00:07,323 --> 00:00:07,623
sent.

2
00:00:07,643 --> 00:00:09,764
Thank you.

3
00:00:33,615 --> 00:00:34,035
Hi everyone.

4
00:00:36,308 --> 00:00:41,950
Hello, noon.

5
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:56,294
We have to end on time, whether I just cut somebody off in the middle of a sentence and click the exit button because the cable folks have told us that this channel they're using to display this meeting has to switch over to.

6
00:00:57,515 --> 00:00:59,755
I'm assuming a city council meeting I can't remember what it was.

7
00:01:01,016 --> 00:01:02,456
But I think we can manage.

8
00:01:05,337 --> 00:01:07,719
people keep joining, but I guess I'll get us going.

9
00:01:07,939 --> 00:01:09,501
Good afternoon, everyone.

10
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:10,601
Thank you for being here.

11
00:01:10,722 --> 00:01:11,722
Can you hear me all okay?

12
00:01:12,683 --> 00:01:14,765
Yes, you all hear me okay.

13
00:01:14,925 --> 00:01:15,245
Excellent.

14
00:01:16,587 --> 00:01:20,410
So I'm gonna call to order once I find something to write on.

15
00:01:23,612 --> 00:01:31,199
So anyway, so this is the Memphis School Committee Subcommittee on Rules and Policy for November 16th.

16
00:01:34,652 --> 00:01:37,754
4 p.m., and I'll just call the roll.

17
00:01:38,775 --> 00:01:40,476
Member Graham?

18
00:01:41,237 --> 00:01:41,497
Here.

19
00:01:43,378 --> 00:01:44,539
And Member McLaughlin?

20
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:45,980
Here.

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,961
And Member Berceau?

22
00:01:48,321 --> 00:01:48,562
Here.

23
00:01:48,602 --> 00:01:49,262
Three present.

24
00:01:51,163 --> 00:01:52,764
Thank you all for coming.

25
00:01:54,225 --> 00:01:55,546
It's an exciting topic.

26
00:01:55,646 --> 00:02:02,591
I'm not going to share, well, I'll just go through the things that were, why we're meeting.

27
00:02:04,063 --> 00:02:05,464
I guess I should read the rest of the posting.

28
00:02:05,644 --> 00:02:06,845
It's been a while, sorry.

29
00:02:07,366 --> 00:02:14,471

39
00:03:36,189 --> 00:03:38,011
So our agenda for tonight is

40
00:03:39,093 --> 00:04:04,347
From a May 16th meeting, school committee approved that the rules and policy subcommittee will review the wellness policy, which is policy ID ADF for K-8 students, be sent to the rules and policy subcommittee for revision, and that it be revised as necessary to ensure unrestricted free play recess is available to all K-8 children daily as part of their social and emotional wellbeing.

41
00:04:05,127 --> 00:04:06,988
The curtailing of unrestricted free play

42
00:04:07,785 --> 00:04:10,017
Recess shall be tracked.

43
00:04:10,682 --> 00:04:20,668
This information shall be returned to the school committee twice each year and be disambiguated by grade, school grade, gender, race, disability, and socioeconomic status.

44
00:04:20,848 --> 00:04:34,156
The subcommittee shall invite at least one teacher and administrator from grades K to five and also from six to eight, as well as the director of student services or her designee to ensure their voices are considered.

45
00:04:34,736 --> 00:04:38,499
The current policy and recommended revised policy will be returned to the

46
00:04:39,302 --> 00:04:43,685
the full school committee no later than the first meeting in November, which has gone by.

47
00:04:45,727 --> 00:04:55,393
So I spoke to, I can't remember, since this is rescheduled, forgive me for not remembering what I was supposed to do.

48
00:04:55,493 --> 00:05:03,399
In today's meeting, the goal was to hear from folks that have opinions on recess, whether that is

49
00:05:09,522 --> 00:05:23,514
the importance of recess, free what they mean by recess, because not everybody agrees on the definition of recess, and also on the impacts of withholding recess as a form of discipline.

50
00:05:25,175 --> 00:05:28,538
And I promised I would not do all the talking.

51
00:05:28,638 --> 00:05:33,182
So unless there's any other members that want to say anything before we open the floor.

52
00:05:33,202 --> 00:05:37,986
All right, does anybody?

53
00:05:38,631 --> 00:05:42,638
I want to speak on this important topic that has got sidelined by the pandemic.

54
00:05:47,888 --> 00:05:49,251
Somebody has to want to speak.

55
00:05:51,877 --> 00:06:12,932
If I may, I was going to say, I think as a district, we truly believe and value the importance of recess and giving students the opportunity to have fresh air, to go outside, to play, to socialize, to get some gross motor movement in, and do activities.

56
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,835
you know, play games, they play tag.

57
00:06:17,496 --> 00:06:29,348
So I think definitely everyone is in support of recess and the true values that students gain from having that as part of

58
00:06:30,663 --> 00:06:31,103
the day.

59
00:06:31,804 --> 00:06:42,288
So it's something that we know people look forward to and a lot of great memories can be made during that time of the day.

60
00:06:42,408 --> 00:06:56,194
So we definitely support recess and just the physical and social, emotional health benefits that come from that.

61
00:06:58,787 --> 00:07:01,848
Thank you, Dr. Edward Benson, my wonderful superintendent.

62
00:07:02,529 --> 00:07:06,030
I just want to throw a couple of little pieces of information out there.

63
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,631
I don't know if everybody here already knows this stuff.

64
00:07:08,691 --> 00:07:11,753
In Massachusetts, recess is not considered time on learning.

65
00:07:13,729 --> 00:07:31,904
So that puts us at a disadvantage to some other states where they have started to finally do this and recognize that recess is not just a time to hang out and do nothing, that it's really for our younger kids, an actual educational part of their education.

66
00:07:32,605 --> 00:07:41,512
And we have recess at the elementary and middle schools, and I believe kindergarten has two recesses, is that correct?

67
00:07:42,493 --> 00:07:43,914
Yes, great, thank you.

68
00:07:44,675 --> 00:07:56,226
And maybe Assistant Superintendent Galussi could just, since I have to admit some ignorance here, tell us what recess looks like at the elementary school.

69
00:07:56,366 --> 00:07:57,987
Like, when does it happen?

70
00:07:58,067 --> 00:07:58,868
How long is it?

71
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:00,970
Sure.

72
00:08:02,602 --> 00:08:05,004
Well, you had mentioned kindergarten does have two.

73
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,046
They're usually around mealtimes.

74
00:08:07,306 --> 00:08:12,651
So before or after morning snack and before or after afternoon lunch.

75
00:08:14,252 --> 00:08:18,856
The structure for grades one through five is either before or after lunch.

76
00:08:19,616 --> 00:08:23,560
And it's, I mean, about 20 to 30 minutes every day.

77
00:08:26,493 --> 00:08:33,556
And so it's structured a little differently depending on space and depending on how the schedules are at each building.

78
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:43,980
So you, the Roberts definitely has a bigger struggle than the other three buildings because the other three buildings have two play areas and the Roberts is confined to one.

79
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:49,222
So Mr. Johnson has more of a heavy lift in terms of scheduling, I believe.

80
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:53,832
He can speak to that if that's something you want more detail about.

81
00:08:54,412 --> 00:09:06,757
But typically, because there's two play areas, there's usually two grade levels out at the same time in the three other buildings in the separate locations for play.

82
00:09:06,777 --> 00:09:14,380
And teachers are spread around for supervision, as well as paraprofessionals, if they are at that grade level.

83
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,443
If there's more detailed questions, I would be more than happy to answer.

84
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:22,367
But that's kind of just the overall structure of it.

85
00:09:23,489 --> 00:09:25,811
If Andy or Kirk want to add anything in, please feel free.

86
00:09:28,654 --> 00:09:31,757
Thanks as well for the Roberts is, as we mentioned, it's pretty tight.

87
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:33,238
We just have one space.

88
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:36,281
So for us, it's one grade level per recess.

89
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:50,154
And as she mentioned, it's usually around recess lunchtimes for the upper grades and kindergarten and the preschool students have a little more flexibility because they're closer to the site, the recess site.

90
00:09:50,474 --> 00:09:54,778
But we are, it's pretty tight, the Roberts School due to one playground area.

91
00:09:57,183 --> 00:09:57,604
Thank you.

92
00:09:58,484 --> 00:10:01,046
That might be something someday to address.

93
00:10:01,647 --> 00:10:09,813
If we could just hear from middle school principals, since, again, I will admit ignorance on how that all works there.

94
00:10:11,574 --> 00:10:18,880
Um, so recess is based on when they really basically get done eating and clean up weather dependent of course.

95
00:10:19,768 --> 00:10:25,011
You know, if it's really cold out, we don't go out for a half an hour, but we'll go out for 15 minutes or so.

96
00:10:25,431 --> 00:10:30,494
Again, it depends on how fast they eat and clean up is the length of the recess each day.

97
00:10:30,514 --> 00:10:39,979
If it's raining out or like significantly raining out, we tend to go into the gymnasium for recess to, we still let them have some time to move around.

98
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,421
But that's basically how it works at the Andrews.

99
00:10:45,033 --> 00:10:46,214
It's very, very similar.

100
00:10:46,434 --> 00:10:52,136
You know, students during the course of their lunch block are essentially, you can think of the lunch block as a 40 minute window of time.

101
00:10:52,417 --> 00:10:55,038
About 20 minutes of that time is spent in the cafeteria eating.

102
00:10:55,118 --> 00:11:00,140
The other 20 minutes is outside engaging in recess.

103
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:04,883
And certainly I'm a huge believer in recess for a number of different reasons.

104
00:11:05,183 --> 00:11:13,507
You know, it benefits students, you know, by increasing their level of physical activity, their memory, attention, concentration, helping them stay on task in the classroom.

105
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:21,970
reducing disruptive types of behavior and just giving them opportunity to improve their social emotional development on a number of different levels.

106
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:26,191
And I think the research really suggests that we continue to use recess.

107
00:11:26,251 --> 00:11:30,713
I see it as a really big thing that we want to build on each of our students' days.

108
00:11:31,453 --> 00:11:40,056
And on days where we can't offer recess because the weather isn't conducive to it, you can see the impact on students too as well when they don't have that during the course of the day.

109
00:11:42,197 --> 00:11:47,302
That's kind of what it looks like at the middle school level, the benefits of what I believe and why I think recess should be in play.

110
00:11:48,423 --> 00:11:54,428
How it looks is it's an opportunity for students to be able to socialize, perhaps at the McGlynn by walking the track at Hormel Stadium.

111
00:11:55,028 --> 00:11:55,969
Maybe they're playing football.

112
00:11:57,030 --> 00:12:00,693
Maybe they're playing soccer, shooting hoops, basketball, foursquare.

113
00:12:01,734 --> 00:12:03,474
You know, things of that sort.

114
00:12:04,255 --> 00:12:06,415
It's an opportunity for people to just socialize with their peers.

115
00:12:06,975 --> 00:12:13,777
And our guidance counselors will push out and sometimes use this opportunity to be able to have some lunch buddy groups outside in the fresh air.

116
00:12:14,497 --> 00:12:21,719
And certainly it's an opportunity for principals, guidance counselors, teachers, paraprofessionals to develop relationships with students too as well in this type of setting.

117
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:25,820
So that's what I have to say about recess and happy to answer any questions people might have.

118
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:31,961
Excellent, thank you.

119
00:12:32,161 --> 00:12:40,930
I greatly appreciate you reminding me as a parent that I don't know what happens to us.

120
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,972
Janine, I believe you had your hand up.

121
00:12:48,857 --> 00:12:50,819
Three years and I'm double unmuting myself.

122
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:56,607
So my name is Shanine Pelliquin.

123
00:12:56,627 --> 00:12:59,129
I'm a recreation therapist and developmental specialist.

124
00:12:59,649 --> 00:13:04,172
Most recently, I've been working as the co-chair of the McGlynn Playground Committee.

125
00:13:04,192 --> 00:13:15,878
I've also done some, I've done several, well, 12 hours of observations of recess there, and also been talking to many teachers and parents across the district about recess over the past couple of years.

126
00:13:15,898 --> 00:13:19,540
I have a third grader at the Roberts, and I'll have an incoming kindergartner next year.

127
00:13:22,342 --> 00:13:23,002
I would say that,

128
00:13:24,424 --> 00:13:41,529
I know that in principle, the district believes in recess, but in my observations, there are many staff who do see the value in child-directed play, but also many others who are very upset by the normal ways that children play, and thus overly restrict the activities of the children.

129
00:13:42,469 --> 00:13:46,510
The concerns of the teachers and other staff do not bear out in the injury data.

130
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:53,412
And in addition, indoor recess quality varies greatly across buildings and by teacher.

131
00:13:55,690 --> 00:14:08,373
Some teachers are really great at having actual playful activities inside, and others consistently put on a screen, which is not child-directed play, has nothing to do with development of agency or social skills.

132
00:14:08,533 --> 00:14:13,635
And I think that I would recommend that the district adopt a policy of no screen times during recess.

133
00:14:13,655 --> 00:14:16,736
Like there, yes, sometimes your class earns a movie,

134
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:20,971
And so you do that, but it should not be allowed during indoor recess.

135
00:14:21,011 --> 00:14:22,092
And we need a better policy.

136
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:28,075
And structured training, I'm not sure what it is, ideas presented to staff for indoor recess.

137
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:34,518
And I just want to maybe see if we can get a definition of child-directed play.

138
00:14:36,619 --> 00:14:42,582
The field of play work, which is a distinct professional approach to working with children,

139
00:14:43,817 --> 00:14:55,191
In playful settings is that child directed play, which sometimes gets called free play or unstructured play is freely chosen personally directed and intrinsically motivated.

140
00:14:57,128 --> 00:15:05,131
This is the only time of the day, sometimes at all, for some kids who are in care all day or who are in other adult-directed activities all day.

141
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:09,512
It's the only time that belongs to them, and this is the development of agency for human beings.

142
00:15:09,572 --> 00:15:25,438
So we really need to value it and make sure that activities at recess are encouraging that personally directed, intrinsically motivated, and personally directed things that children want to do.

143
00:15:26,438 --> 00:15:26,698
Thank you.

144
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,981
Thank you very much.

145
00:15:30,361 --> 00:15:38,985
I appreciate the definition because I certainly said free play and had a rather vague conception of what that meant.

146
00:15:39,585 --> 00:15:46,808
Yeah, so free play is tricky because it connotes like monetary value or adults get really worried about chaos, right?

147
00:15:48,469 --> 00:15:55,792
And if, I mean, all of us are people who have worked with children and unstructured play is a misnomer there because I'm sure, I mean, if we think about even

148
00:15:56,675 --> 00:16:03,018
The Calvin Ball is a really great illustration of how children structure their own play.

149
00:16:03,498 --> 00:16:06,680
But we've all been playing with a kid and bumped up against a rule that they make.

150
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:11,122
So unstructured play is actually like a value statement on who's doing the structuring.

151
00:16:11,463 --> 00:16:15,044
The children are doing the structuring in their own child-directed play.

152
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:18,026
Thank you.

153
00:16:18,046 --> 00:16:18,866
That's very helpful.

154
00:16:18,926 --> 00:16:25,830
And we tried to visit this topic in 2019, and then there was a little pandemic in the way.

155
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:47,050
And in preparations in 2019 for this work, I was watching these videos, I think it's Australia, where there was this wonderful series, which I won't make you all sit through here, where the principal sort of dropped all the rules, frankly.

156
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,231
I mean, it was really, I'll...

157
00:16:51,005 --> 00:17:08,371
have it included in the minutes, the link to it, but it was really remarkable to see that the fears of teachers, the fears of parents, that they just didn't, that they weren't accurate fear, like they were real, the fears are real, but the

158
00:17:09,287 --> 00:17:11,448
result wasn't anything like what anybody thought.

159
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:14,710
And, you know, did any kid ever break an arm?

160
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:15,031
Yes.

161
00:17:15,091 --> 00:17:20,014
But I can tell you right now that a friend of mine, their kid broke their arm twice at the mistook.

162
00:17:20,774 --> 00:17:25,677
And, you know, that did not look like the Australian elementary school.

163
00:17:25,737 --> 00:17:29,079
So, you know, injuries will happen.

164
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:36,544
But as Miss Bellaquin said, the data does not suggest that there's any increase in injuries by

165
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:42,782
just letting the kids do it themselves.

166
00:17:42,902 --> 00:17:44,422
And I don't know if that's the right word.

167
00:17:46,643 --> 00:17:49,844
So anyways, who else would like to speak on this?

168
00:17:55,646 --> 00:17:57,026
I'll just throw in something real quick.

169
00:17:57,087 --> 00:17:59,427
Oh, I'm sorry, Member McLaughlin, let me just say this real quick.

170
00:18:00,188 --> 00:18:04,409
I did review our wellness policy, which is what we're supposed to do during this subcommittee.

171
00:18:05,349 --> 00:18:06,890
And I reviewed the wellness policy

172
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:10,232
three or four surrounding communities.

173
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:14,076
And our wellness policy does not use the word recess in any way.

174
00:18:14,276 --> 00:18:15,037
It's just not there.

175
00:18:16,398 --> 00:18:26,748
And all of the other districts I looked at, and I didn't go through 351 districts, but all of them, really, there was a theme.

176
00:18:27,089 --> 00:18:27,709
And that was,

177
00:18:29,723 --> 00:18:32,465
recess will not be taken away as discipline.

178
00:18:34,586 --> 00:18:47,015
And that's the main thrust of all of those policies that have clearly been updated in response to the research and evidence around this stuff.

179
00:18:47,115 --> 00:18:54,180
But when I, and the next meeting we'll talk about actual policy from Medford, but Member McLaughlin, sorry to delay.

180
00:18:58,388 --> 00:19:13,454
Hi, yeah, so I was curious if Shanine was asking us for a deliverable to recommend as part of what we're bringing forward from the subcommittee to the school committee that is included with the request.

181
00:19:13,494 --> 00:19:24,619
I'm not sure what specifically you are asking for, Shanine, and I just wanted to make sure that we had some quick clarification on that, just like one, two, this is what I'm asking.

182
00:19:24,819 --> 00:19:26,540
A definition of child-directed play.

183
00:19:27,442 --> 00:19:34,069
that I will email to Paul, but again, is freely chosen, personally directed, and intrinsically motivated.

184
00:19:34,449 --> 00:19:37,833
So children get to choose their own play.

185
00:19:37,853 --> 00:19:40,115
Here come mine.

186
00:19:40,716 --> 00:19:44,780
They get to choose what they do in their time and be in charge of it.

187
00:19:45,801 --> 00:19:46,201
Thank you.

188
00:19:46,221 --> 00:19:46,942
There they are, muting.

189
00:19:52,720 --> 00:20:03,145
I guess I'm just, I guess, I under, I just guess I'm a little confused that, to my knowledge, right this is that's the structure.

190
00:20:04,926 --> 00:20:10,328
Listen to Mr downs and Mr Chuchi Mr Chuchi did a great job with all of this elaborate detail.

191
00:20:10,987 --> 00:20:15,649
which sounded child-directed.

192
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:19,812
I know at the elementary level, it's child-directed.

193
00:20:21,312 --> 00:20:24,714
Teachers are not structuring and telling students what they should play.

194
00:20:25,655 --> 00:20:38,081
Maybe there's a limit in terms of if students want to bring certain props or toys or games from home, there may be questions or discussions within reason, but recess at the elementary level,

195
00:20:39,707 --> 00:20:41,147
Is the child directed?

196
00:20:43,528 --> 00:20:59,971
So, yes, I guess I want to make sure that that is preserved because many schools, even in the Boston area, have gone with recess companies, such as Playworks, which is different than the field of playwork, but which comes in and teaches recess skills.

197
00:21:00,691 --> 00:21:07,713
And I want to make sure that that is not an answer that Medford comes to, as well as

198
00:21:08,709 --> 00:21:15,554
as a framework for being able to, teachers are not educated about play necessarily.

199
00:21:15,855 --> 00:21:28,845
They have so many other wonderful skills, but as for play and the value of it, it's developmental, et cetera, that's not typically included in that educational framework.

200
00:21:30,446 --> 00:21:31,707
It's not just blowing off steam.

201
00:21:31,767 --> 00:21:35,270
It's actually where children develop themselves that they are,

202
00:21:35,733 --> 00:21:43,237
They get to develop a zone of proximal development around themselves so that they can grow and play both reveals and drives child development.

203
00:21:43,277 --> 00:21:45,958
And I just want to make sure that that is protected in this policy.

204
00:21:47,813 --> 00:21:48,774
If I, if you don't mind.

205
00:21:49,354 --> 00:21:50,615
Sorry, a little late.

206
00:21:51,056 --> 00:21:53,578
Nancy Sherman Hudson from the next tech assistant principal.

207
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:56,801
So, actually I was lucky enough.

208
00:21:57,201 --> 00:22:03,266
My graduate work was done at Leslie, which play based playing is exactly what you are taught.

209
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:08,971
And I have found that especially for early childhood and early elementary children.

210
00:22:09,793 --> 00:22:17,916
That they are directing their own play here at the mist attack what we've done, and it actually came off a coven because we had to keep the kids separated.

211
00:22:18,697 --> 00:22:23,839
So we gave them an opportunity to have different stations if they wanted to visit different stations, etc.

212
00:22:24,499 --> 00:22:28,161
They could use what was at that station or make something up themselves.

213
00:22:28,821 --> 00:22:35,303
So we have found that the children that need a little bit of prompting, this is a wonderful format.

214
00:22:35,683 --> 00:22:38,383
Okay, we have balls over here if you wanna go in this area.

215
00:22:38,443 --> 00:22:40,764
We have the playground up here if you wanna go here.

216
00:22:41,124 --> 00:22:48,806
It also allows for teachers to station themselves in that area so that they can watch and make sure everyone is safe.

217
00:22:49,366 --> 00:22:52,426
So at least I can only speak for elementary.

218
00:22:52,526 --> 00:22:54,287
I do believe that our teachers

219
00:22:55,804 --> 00:23:03,750
strongly believe in that play base to make sure that the students are using that creative end of their minds, which is, of course, very, very important.

220
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:08,413
So I only can speak for our school, the Mississauga.

221
00:23:10,174 --> 00:23:12,056
Thank you very much, Mrs. Sherman-Hudson.

222
00:23:14,517 --> 00:23:18,000
Ingrid, I don't know if you can unmute yourself.

223
00:23:20,173 --> 00:23:23,995
Hi, sorry my camera doesn't work right now, I'm just gonna talk.

224
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:36,223
So I just want to say that I'm excited to see the recess to be in the policy of the school, like in the handbook, because I haven't seen it there and I think it needs to be there.

225
00:23:36,243 --> 00:23:41,287
I wanted to see it be protected so that

226
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:49,750
kids are not taking being so they don't, so the teachers don't take recess away for disciplinary reasons.

227
00:23:50,711 --> 00:23:55,092
I think it happens very often, but it does happen sometimes.

228
00:23:55,852 --> 00:24:04,495
If a kid doesn't complete their work, then sometimes they stay in the classroom or, you know, for other reason, another reason that is not safety related sometimes.

229
00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:07,039
they miss recess.

230
00:24:07,199 --> 00:24:10,382
And I, you know, I want that to be in the policy so that doesn't happen.

231
00:24:11,222 --> 00:24:12,263
So that's one thing I wanted to say.

232
00:24:12,303 --> 00:24:18,689
The other thing is that I would also like to see a consistent policy about when to declare indoor recess.

233
00:24:19,469 --> 00:24:25,154
Because in my experience in the Medford public schools, they're very conservative with that.

234
00:24:25,454 --> 00:24:31,239
And like, if it rains just a little bit, or if it's snowing just a little bit, they declare indoor recess.

235
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:44,954
Like we talked about the free play and the intrinsic play and all that, but when the kids are still in the classroom all day long and stay in the classroom to doing the recess, it's really detrimental for them.

236
00:24:45,294 --> 00:24:56,602
And the more that they can go outside and do, you know, play and do things that are not structured, not with, you know, I know it's recess, but you're still in the classroom.

237
00:24:56,622 --> 00:24:57,783
So it's definitely not the same.

238
00:24:59,266 --> 00:25:03,090
And it's very hard to play when you're still in the same classroom.

239
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:04,431
It's hard to move.

240
00:25:04,491 --> 00:25:13,681
It's hard to be social and free with your friends without worrying that other people are looking at you and all that.

241
00:25:13,921 --> 00:25:17,224
And also, it's hard to move and it's hard to get fresh air.

242
00:25:19,536 --> 00:25:34,692
I would like to see a consistent policy and to see if we can maybe think about ways and the kids can still go outside maybe for less time or, you know, maybe provide jackets for the kids who don't have any we've tried that in the midst of we have on.

243
00:25:35,946 --> 00:25:38,708
we have like lockers with extra clothes.

244
00:25:39,249 --> 00:25:41,750
So then the kids can go outside and if they get wet, they can change.

245
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:43,552
If they get cold, it's only 20 minutes.

246
00:25:43,612 --> 00:25:50,017
I mean, if you go outside for 20 minutes, it really doesn't hurt you to be outside in the cold for just 30 minutes.

247
00:25:50,737 --> 00:25:52,819
So anyway, I just wanted to mention that.

248
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,161
Thank you very much.

249
00:25:55,861 --> 00:26:04,468
And we will talk about, I can't remember which school district, but there's a childcare weather watch, essentially,

250
00:26:05,315 --> 00:26:13,945
a graph, a table that decides for everyone whether or not kids are going out or not.

251
00:26:14,145 --> 00:26:17,749
And hopefully we can include that in our policy when we get to that part.

252
00:26:19,231 --> 00:26:19,491
Emily.

253
00:26:22,115 --> 00:26:25,016
Hi, I'm a teacher at the Andrews Middle School.

254
00:26:25,276 --> 00:26:27,516
I just had two comments to share.

255
00:26:28,436 --> 00:26:38,978
One of them that I don't think was mentioned is that at the Andrews, at least, I know the students also have the option to go to the library during that recess portion after they eat.

256
00:26:39,579 --> 00:26:51,061
And I think this does meet the definition that Shanine was sharing about, you know, child-directed, child-centered, intrinsically motivated, you know, so there are students that

257
00:26:52,042 --> 00:26:57,028
You know, want to go look at books or pick out a book and read in the library I think that's a great option.

258
00:26:57,609 --> 00:27:01,093
I don't know if all the schools across the board have that but I know at the Andrews we do.

259
00:27:01,774 --> 00:27:03,917
And a lot of it's a very desirable option.

260
00:27:04,438 --> 00:27:06,421
Many students want to take advantage of it.

261
00:27:08,302 --> 00:27:11,763
And my other comment was from the teacher side.

262
00:27:12,143 --> 00:27:33,313
I just wanted to share that I know often if a student is absent and they need to, let's say, make up a quiz or something like that, or even get extra help, often they will want to stay with me during that recess period to do that rather than, you know, staying after school, for example.

263
00:27:34,213 --> 00:27:38,855
because some students, you know, cannot stay after school or don't want to stay after school.

264
00:27:39,736 --> 00:27:56,263
So I try to offer that as an option as kind of like an equity, you know, to give that all students, you know, a fair shot to do that if they can't stay after school for other reasons, the schedule is tight, so they might not have another opportunity to make up a quiz or something works.

265
00:27:56,384 --> 00:27:59,065
So I just wanted to put that out there as well that

266
00:28:00,326 --> 00:28:11,353
I agree that recess is really important and maybe not from the discipline aspect, but in terms of allowing students to use their recess time if how they would like.

267
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:22,587
And member Russo, if I may piggyback off of what Emily was just sharing, I have seen it myself.

268
00:28:23,067 --> 00:28:41,932
I know one of the times I was recently at the Andrews during one of their recess blocks when we went outside and there were students that chose not to be in the field area or the basketball court area, but they chose to sit at that particular school, again, a different setup.

269
00:28:43,776 --> 00:28:45,404
a bench or I don't know if it's a.

270
00:28:46,822 --> 00:28:54,085
haunted planter area, but some students just chose to, you know, it might be two students, it might be three students together.

271
00:28:54,706 --> 00:29:00,909
They prefer to be in a smaller group as opposed to, you know, the overstimulation of a very, very large group.

272
00:29:01,429 --> 00:29:08,072
So I think also just being aware of the different needs of the students.

273
00:29:08,092 --> 00:29:15,996
So I really do love that idea of the students that actually choose to go to the library and be in a quiet environment and read

274
00:29:16,636 --> 00:29:28,264
And to them, 15, 20 minutes of being able to read or be in a quiet environment in the library is what satisfies them or makes them happy.

275
00:29:28,844 --> 00:29:41,313
So I just wanted to say that just listening to the different descriptions of what's been said today, that you really cannot have a one size fits all.

276
00:29:45,015 --> 00:29:55,479
limitations that we talked at the top of this meeting about was the physical layout of the different schools, and how much space is actually available.

277
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:59,901
Some schools have a lower playground and upper playground.

278
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:03,863
So, you know, you have more real estate to work with.

279
00:30:04,943 --> 00:30:10,948
and greater flexibility at the Missatuck, they won the lottery on that one.

280
00:30:10,988 --> 00:30:15,192
They've got plenty of space, lower playground, upper playground, fields.

281
00:30:15,832 --> 00:30:23,979
So they have access to a lot of greenery and just a lot of space to spread out and do a lot of different activities.

282
00:30:24,419 --> 00:30:29,163
So I just wanted to say it does sometimes look a little, you know,

283
00:30:29,944 --> 00:30:36,639
differently but you know when you observe the kids and when I'm out in the field looking at the students.

284
00:30:38,326 --> 00:30:42,247
especially during unstructured time, I wanna see kids happy.

285
00:30:43,228 --> 00:30:58,613
And I can say to you during that time, you do see kids enjoying themselves, laughing, telling jokes, some are playing sports, they're being competitive, they make up their own rules to their own self-created games, but it is a happy time.

286
00:30:58,633 --> 00:31:04,235
And I just also wanna keep that in mind that we are,

287
00:31:05,548 --> 00:31:20,914
prioritizing our students, and again, the way they interpret or use that time, it may look differently, but I do feel that it is more student-led than adult-led.

288
00:31:22,134 --> 00:31:31,538
The resources and materials may be put there by the adults, but the students use their creativity in terms of how they choose to do the different activities.

289
00:31:32,358 --> 00:31:32,678
Thank you.

290
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:38,203
Thank you and we have lots of hands going up I've got a list so member McLaughlin.

291
00:31:40,264 --> 00:31:40,605
Thank you.

292
00:31:40,625 --> 00:31:51,471
I was just going to add that it you know this feels like the conversation that she was having at the top of the meeting around child directed play so it sounds like there's a lot of options and opportunities for different.

293
00:31:53,615 --> 00:32:03,323
decisions that the child can make, you know, going from the library to whether they choose to, you know, switch out from an after school option to during the day.

294
00:32:03,403 --> 00:32:10,689
So I think that could cover it with a very clear definition, but I'm curious to hear what other folks think.

295
00:32:10,789 --> 00:32:11,089
Thanks.

296
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:13,191
Thank you.

297
00:32:13,731 --> 00:32:14,232
Member Graham.

298
00:32:17,694 --> 00:32:18,055
Thank you.

299
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:25,994
Um, I think, you know, one of the things that strikes me is, uh, why we're even talking about this in the first place.

300
00:32:26,414 --> 00:32:40,582
And I think the truth is we're talking about this because parents feel like these concepts that I think are pretty widely agreeable on this call are wildly inconsistently applied across the district.

301
00:32:41,222 --> 00:32:41,542
So, um,

302
00:32:43,303 --> 00:32:51,066
It's been a few years since recess was normal and things were regular, right?

303
00:32:51,486 --> 00:33:02,291
But I can recall pre-COVID on many a day getting calls from friends with kids across the district saying, did your kid go out for recess today?

304
00:33:02,771 --> 00:33:04,531
And the answers were all over the board.

305
00:33:04,752 --> 00:33:07,973
And I'm here to say the weather is the same everywhere in Medford.

306
00:33:09,255 --> 00:33:13,981
maybe once a year, it starts raining at the McGlynn later than it starts raining at the Brooks.

307
00:33:14,321 --> 00:33:17,265
But by and large, the weather's the same.

308
00:33:17,585 --> 00:33:22,851
And yet, every time this question came up, there was a huge variation in how

309
00:33:26,225 --> 00:33:29,309
something as simple as the weather was interpreted across the district.

310
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:38,660
I also had friends at various schools who would have told you that their kids spent most of the winter inside.

311
00:33:39,752 --> 00:33:40,993
for one reason or another.

312
00:33:41,013 --> 00:33:48,037
And I think, and I remember talking to the prior assistant superintendent of elementary education right before I took office.

313
00:33:48,798 --> 00:33:55,742
And she gave me a very long list of reasons why kids could not possibly go outside in certain schools.

314
00:33:57,843 --> 00:34:05,088
And my challenge to her at the time and my challenge to all of us is to think about what it would take so that

315
00:34:06,048 --> 00:34:10,291
movable barriers don't get in the way of kids going outside for recess.

316
00:34:10,391 --> 00:34:24,720
I think you know at the middle school level where the kids have a little bit more agency and some and a lot more freedom to direct their time like all the things that we talked about at the middle school level feel like they are child directed and they are

317
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:29,064
They are helping children develop decision making skills that I think are really important.

318
00:34:29,725 --> 00:34:39,035
I think at the elementary level where the kids have considerably less agency, and many fewer choices like I'm not aware that the library at recess is an option at the elementary level.

319
00:34:40,997 --> 00:35:04,276
I think we need to really think about how do we make sure that we are consistently applying whatever the policy becomes across the district so that we're not like sort of creating this feeling that depending on what school you're at you're going to have a different experience and your kid may or may not get to move their body during the day in a way that they feel like is necessary.

320
00:35:05,377 --> 00:35:09,198
So I think that's one big reason why we are here talking about that.

321
00:35:09,298 --> 00:35:24,661
And I think the other big reason we're here talking about that is because there are parents across our community and some very vocal who will tell you about all the times their kid has been, recess has been revoked from their child for disciplinary reasons.

322
00:35:24,881 --> 00:35:28,502
Again, I hear about it much, much more at the elementary school level.

323
00:35:29,302 --> 00:35:34,463
That's probably because middle schoolers come home and they don't tell you anything about what happened during their day.

324
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:45,727
Or maybe they just have many more choices, but I do hear, you know, from parents about this idea of taking recess away as a form of punishment.

325
00:35:46,647 --> 00:35:53,370
And I do, so I do think, you know, if we're to boil down why we're here and why we are feeling like there needs to be a policy at all.

326
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:54,730
Those are the two reasons.

327
00:35:55,131 --> 00:35:55,891
And those are like,

328
00:35:56,491 --> 00:36:17,005
historical experiences that are sort of consistent and repeated that we need to grapple with as a district to make sure that I think this thing we all agree on here on this call actually can be demonstrated and everybody else in the community can believe us when we say we believe in child-directed play.

329
00:36:17,145 --> 00:36:20,268
So I feel like that's sort of the challenge that we have

330
00:36:21,908 --> 00:36:22,469
before us.

331
00:36:22,549 --> 00:36:34,214
And I think that's where having a written policy about, you know, what the expectations are around recess is, you know, one first step in the right direction.

332
00:36:34,274 --> 00:36:42,218
And then, you know, it will be incumbent on many of the people on this call to actually make sure that policy is consistently applied and administered.

333
00:36:42,298 --> 00:36:49,761
But I think the first step is for us to have this thoughtful conversation about what from a policy perspective are we trying to accomplish?

334
00:36:50,503 --> 00:36:56,728
I want you all to think that we asked you to come here because we made up some work to do that didn't need done.

335
00:36:57,208 --> 00:36:58,369
And I don't think that's true at all.

336
00:36:58,409 --> 00:37:02,012
So I just wanted to offer that to the conversation.

337
00:37:03,834 --> 00:37:04,954
Thank you, Member Graham.

338
00:37:05,775 --> 00:37:11,820
Next person I have, Christina, did you have your hand up?

339
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:13,221
I did not, sorry.

340
00:37:13,321 --> 00:37:16,904
I came in late, so I'm feeling like totally out of time.

341
00:37:16,924 --> 00:37:18,025
That's okay, that's fine, that's fine.

342
00:37:19,825 --> 00:37:19,965
Ms.

343
00:37:19,985 --> 00:37:20,285
Demas.

344
00:37:21,867 --> 00:37:22,487
Hi, thank you.

345
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:25,930
I too came in late from a meeting, so I apologize for that.

346
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:41,302
And I know I missed the beginning of the conversation, but I just felt it was important to share that when we look at recess on the elementary level, we look at it as a win block for the students, right?

347
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:42,803
So it's what individuals need.

348
00:37:43,143 --> 00:37:48,748
So it is center-based, it is child-based, but it's not gonna look the same for every child.

349
00:37:49,308 --> 00:38:06,840
So in the elementary, in I'll speak for the Brooks, we do not have the availability to A, staff or B, use the library during our recess times because it goes from 11.55 to 1.30 with the three lunches here in the block scheduling happening.

350
00:38:07,181 --> 00:38:13,945
So what we would do for a student that would want to access the library at that time, we have some pretty avid readers.

351
00:38:14,526 --> 00:38:15,887
And so we have benches outside

352
00:38:16,467 --> 00:38:33,032
We have blankets outside, they can sit and read there instead of the library, so I think we all need to remember to that you know we are looking at each child individually and their interests, we do have some students that do at their age in developmental stage.

353
00:38:33,452 --> 00:38:50,880
do require a little bit of prompting and help engaging in using some social pragmatics and things and so that's why we have the staff out there, but they do have those playground baskets and they do have the opportunity to create their own games and their own ways of playing with those.

354
00:38:51,821 --> 00:38:52,822
items that are out there.

355
00:38:53,842 --> 00:39:12,099
I just wanted to make sure that if we are going to talk about consistency across the district, I know that we have our magic number of what constitutes an indoor recess, but it sounds to me like the conversation, which I may have missed again, I apologize, leads more to that light precipitation of when you go out or when you stay in.

356
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:21,026
I would caution people with having a blanket statement to that because not all students come in prepared, dressed and ready to go outside.

357
00:39:21,847 --> 00:39:29,813
And we don't always have the size and the ample clothes to give to those students.

358
00:39:29,893 --> 00:39:33,156
And I would hate to exclude anybody because they didn't have something.

359
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:41,983
So I think that if we are going to get to the point of that, we're peeling a pot that onion to that level, I do think we probably need to have conversations of,

360
00:39:42,734 --> 00:39:53,036
communication out to the families for expectations of what needs to be brought into school each day with the expectation that you will be going outside and that it should just be a different conversation.

361
00:39:53,056 --> 00:39:59,558
But I wanted you to hear as well as, you know, my lens to recess is that wind block, right?

362
00:39:59,618 --> 00:40:01,298
Like what the individuals need.

363
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:08,320
And I do think that we do a pretty good job with that here at the, in Medford.

364
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:09,960
That's all I wanted to say.

365
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:11,761
Thank you very much.

366
00:40:13,318 --> 00:40:19,763
I just, I just want to clarify something about the library as well.

367
00:40:20,343 --> 00:40:20,944
It's twofold.

368
00:40:21,084 --> 00:40:28,589
One is that for some students, being outside with kids running around is in the way that you've all want them to run around.

369
00:40:28,609 --> 00:40:30,550
It can be overstimulating for some kids.

370
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:34,873
And for some students, it's a little much for them to handle.

371
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:40,117
So they prefer to go to the library and read, which is great because we want kids reading as much as possible.

372
00:40:40,672 --> 00:40:52,520
And the other part of our library process is that we do have a game group where they learn to interact with other peers, playing games in a structured manner, which they tend to like.

373
00:40:53,060 --> 00:41:00,565
And if you don't believe me, you can always come down block five for grade six, because they barrel into that office looking for those passes.

374
00:41:01,105 --> 00:41:03,006
So it's multi-step.

375
00:41:03,166 --> 00:41:08,950
I know if you want to have a policy, but if you over-prescribe, I don't want that library time taken away for kids that really prefer

376
00:41:09,589 --> 00:41:20,638
for that time, that quiet time away from their peers, and also just to have their own time to read or to play in a structured manner with their friends or new friends in some cases.

377
00:41:20,818 --> 00:41:21,939
So that's all I wanted to say.

378
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,041
Thank you, Mr. Downs.

379
00:41:27,703 --> 00:41:28,444
I wrote down Ms.

380
00:41:30,505 --> 00:41:30,886
Gluthie.

381
00:41:33,346 --> 00:41:47,006
Well, we'll say principle demos kind of captured a lot of what I was going to say, but I just think there's a there's it feels like two separate conversations going on one about what precipitates indoor recess.

382
00:41:47,915 --> 00:41:57,922
well, maybe three conversations, what's done during indoor recess and how those calls are made, and then the child-centered play while outdoors.

383
00:41:59,103 --> 00:42:10,611
I did want to say, I saw Principal O'Brien holding up, for years, the elementary principals have aligned around the call for indoor recess if it's not precipitating.

384
00:42:11,271 --> 00:42:14,533
And I know it's been communicated to some,

385
00:42:15,494 --> 00:42:21,339
school communities, but it's really a real feel less than 25 degrees.

386
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:26,863
You're outside and it's not the hard temperature, it's the real feel.

387
00:42:29,025 --> 00:42:34,489
That's what warrants indoor recess if it's not a level of precipitation.

388
00:42:35,109 --> 00:42:44,697
Have there been some situations where maybe like snow removal was an issue and so there was like a safety concern at some of the elementary buildings in the wintertime?

389
00:42:45,757 --> 00:42:48,800
That's definitely been, you know, an issue.

390
00:42:49,421 --> 00:42:59,811
But for the most part, there is that belief of how important fresh air and recess and free play is for children so that

391
00:43:01,405 --> 00:43:03,707
real feel of 25 degrees.

392
00:43:04,668 --> 00:43:16,397
We're outside, and we're telling children to go outside there is as principal demos talked about sometimes the feasibility of how prepared students are, but a lot of that is handled on a case by case basis.

393
00:43:17,198 --> 00:43:18,339
I do want to say.

394
00:43:21,507 --> 00:43:30,832
The elementary schools are responsive classroom schools and the tenant of responsive classroom is about logical consequences.

395
00:43:31,492 --> 00:43:40,397
So I do, which means that recess should not be used as a punishment.

396
00:43:40,877 --> 00:43:48,981
However, if we do have unsafe behaviors in schools, our job is to educate children around

397
00:43:51,113 --> 00:43:55,395
pro-social behaviors and the safety of being around their peers.

398
00:43:55,836 --> 00:44:04,760
And so sometimes if they're exhibiting that, especially during play, the logical consequence is that they're removed from that.

399
00:44:05,221 --> 00:44:06,321
They're still outside.

400
00:44:06,401 --> 00:44:07,882
There may be a reflective moment.

401
00:44:07,962 --> 00:44:09,283
There may be a walking moment.

402
00:44:09,843 --> 00:44:16,087
The element of child directed may be skewed because that's the logical consequence for the action.

403
00:44:17,067 --> 00:44:21,389
I don't know of it being used for anything other than that.

404
00:44:22,129 --> 00:44:28,832
If there are those like one off situations I would, I would really welcome a conversation about that.

405
00:44:31,218 --> 00:44:49,772
but I just wanted to kind of capture the piece of the responsive classroom being around what's logical because that's how children, especially at the elementary level, make connections around their behavior is when the consequences are logical to what the behavior was.

406
00:44:52,994 --> 00:44:53,254
Thanks.

407
00:44:53,654 --> 00:44:53,955
That's it.

408
00:44:53,975 --> 00:44:54,935
That's all I have for right now.

409
00:44:55,876 --> 00:44:56,296
Thank you.

410
00:44:56,476 --> 00:44:57,257
Member McLaughlin.

411
00:45:00,790 --> 00:45:01,250
Thank you.

412
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:15,299
Yeah, I don't know I would disagree with some of that, respectfully, I think that in terms of recess I think it's super important for most kids and I do believe in logical consequences when logical consequences can be understood and when there's a direct correlation.

413
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:21,263
There's lots of times that you know kids with disabilities and others might not be able to understand the direct correlation between

414
00:45:22,363 --> 00:45:24,865
recess and having it taken away and behavior.

415
00:45:25,025 --> 00:45:30,528
And so that's much more complicated in terms of behavior plans and all of the things that we know go into place.

416
00:45:30,608 --> 00:45:43,015
But, and a lot of times our kids who we may see more behavior with have a higher need for exercise, like folks who might be identified as having ADHD or things like that.

417
00:45:43,135 --> 00:45:46,998
So, and we also potentially see disproportionality in,

418
00:45:49,179 --> 00:45:54,663
punishment, if you will, for students with disabilities and minorities, particularly.

419
00:45:55,143 --> 00:46:00,707
Not necessarily speaking specifically to our district and our data, but we know that that's an issue in education as a whole.

420
00:46:01,788 --> 00:46:04,070
And hopefully we will be looking at some of our data overall.

421
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:07,692
But I think that those are factors that need to be considered as well.

422
00:46:08,213 --> 00:46:14,397
And back to what Shannon was saying a few minutes ago as well in terms of

423
00:46:14,976 --> 00:46:41,525
you know, ensuring that families have and understand home notices for requirements for their children to go outside or what have you, I think maybe we could work with the community to ensure that there are some extra, especially at the elementary, well, at all the school levels, that there are extra codes, like what we saw at Missituck with the PTO at Missituck, because there may be families that actually don't have that, or, you know, families where they're not able to provide that or don't understand what's being asked of that.

424
00:46:42,245 --> 00:46:50,148
whole host of situations that I just want to make sure we're thinking outside the margins for all of our children.

425
00:46:50,648 --> 00:46:50,969
Thanks.

426
00:46:52,429 --> 00:46:55,410
Thank you, Member McLaughlin.

427
00:46:55,430 --> 00:46:56,411
Ms.

428
00:46:56,431 --> 00:46:56,791
Peliquin.

429
00:47:02,473 --> 00:47:11,897
The removal, I mean, to echo what Melanie said, the removal of recess is only logical as a consequence of the behavior is at recess and behavior has a reason underlying it.

430
00:47:12,583 --> 00:47:19,948
And behaviorism of the antecedent and the consequence and the rewards and the punishment is only one way to look at behavior.

431
00:47:19,968 --> 00:47:40,922
I would highly recommend all of the administration and school committee members take a look at the lives and the balance, which is a transformative way of looking at behavior in schools that addresses the underlying lagging skills that children have, particularly children who get in trouble a lot, and gives a framework

432
00:47:41,379 --> 00:47:47,121
with completely free resources on how to address those behaviors at livesinthebalance.org.

433
00:47:49,362 --> 00:47:55,364
But back to Jenny's policy piece, I feel like since I said the thing about child-directed play, people have been really defensive about like, but we do believe this.

434
00:47:55,424 --> 00:48:00,426
And yes, most people do, and the people who are in this space do, which is why we're in this space.

435
00:48:01,006 --> 00:48:03,667
But as Jenny said,

436
00:48:04,342 --> 00:48:06,562
the difference in how it's actually being implemented.

437
00:48:06,602 --> 00:48:12,163
And maybe the principals are talking about it and deciding if they're going out for recess, but that's not what's happening in the classrooms for the children.

438
00:48:12,203 --> 00:48:13,804
So what do we wanna see going forward?

439
00:48:14,664 --> 00:48:26,186
And also I just wanna, one of the things that has come up at the playground meetings for the McGlynn is a very big concern from all of the members of the committee that walking recess is public shaming.

440
00:48:27,906 --> 00:48:33,567
Because there is no other reason you would just be walking laps as an eight year old at recess.

441
00:48:35,531 --> 00:48:41,434
unless you have some diagnosis that makes it hard for you to participate in play, and then you have enough reasons to be standing out.

442
00:48:41,454 --> 00:48:44,375
And we don't need walking recess to be pointed out to everyone.

443
00:48:45,456 --> 00:48:50,598
And teachers do need to be able to address challenging behaviors, but there are other ways besides reward and punishment.

444
00:48:52,859 --> 00:48:53,259
Thank you.

445
00:48:53,799 --> 00:48:53,899
Ms.

446
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:55,000
Sherwood-Hudson.

447
00:48:57,674 --> 00:49:04,015
I apologize for not being able to raise my hand, but physically, it seems like all my things are not working.

448
00:49:05,816 --> 00:49:21,739
So I will actually address, because at the Missitech, part of our PBIS program and the responsive classroom, which we're blending together, is the fact that when a child does need some type of a consequence for whatever their action is, is that we have a time to reflect sheet.

449
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:23,840
So that time to reflect time,

450
00:49:25,062 --> 00:49:30,169
Years ago, it used to be we assigned a staff member to sit down, talk them through what happened.

451
00:49:31,431 --> 00:49:40,845
We are able to at least take the data from that to find out what times of day does this happen, how frequently, so we're able to tier that student to give them what they need.

452
00:49:42,051 --> 00:49:56,997
Right now at the mist attack if a child is having a difficult time, and there is a consequence, they do have the shadow the teacher, but before they shadow the teacher they're talking to the teacher the teachers also talking with them about whatever happened.

453
00:49:58,237 --> 00:50:00,881
for them to have created this kind of type of a consequence.

454
00:50:01,942 --> 00:50:05,567
Because we do respect the fact that they need to get outside, get some fresh air.

455
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:10,614
I understand your comment about public shaming.

456
00:50:10,995 --> 00:50:14,660
I'm not sure if, I don't know, if that

457
00:50:16,091 --> 00:50:21,793
what part of the day we would be able to truly give them that kind of attention at the same time.

458
00:50:22,613 --> 00:50:32,956
If they have done something and their students have seen that, then I find out from parents, well, this child was never consequence because such and such a thing happened.

459
00:50:33,536 --> 00:50:39,058
So I think the elementary level teachers would be

460
00:50:40,675 --> 00:50:58,999
love to know how the students can do this time to reflect so they understand it, and going out at recess time, getting their fresh air, but at the same time, they feel, okay, I did my apologies, I've written what the issues have been, and then move on from there.

461
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:10,162
But I mean, it's an interesting point that you put that level of, that you feel that it's shaming, and that's something that we maybe can come back to the PBIS and the responsive classroom and find a way to have that work.

462
00:51:10,753 --> 00:51:12,096
so that they don't feel that way.

463
00:51:15,301 --> 00:51:15,702
Thank you.

464
00:51:18,066 --> 00:51:19,830
Mr. O'Brien.

465
00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:21,831
Yes, thank you.

466
00:51:23,172 --> 00:51:25,715
The only point, well two points.

467
00:51:26,415 --> 00:51:36,746
One is a priority of recess for all adults and kids is number one, to keep it safe, to keep it safe.

468
00:51:36,946 --> 00:51:40,770
We want self directed play, and we want it done safely.

469
00:51:41,833 --> 00:51:46,996
If we identify unsafe behavior, to piggyback off of what Ms.

470
00:51:47,016 --> 00:51:52,619
Galussi says, we do administer that logical consequence, which is time bound.

471
00:51:53,699 --> 00:51:55,240
So a hypothetical.

472
00:51:55,340 --> 00:52:04,685
And so my other point too is just, I wanna bring everybody to an awareness of just cautioning against micromanaging recess.

473
00:52:04,845 --> 00:52:09,227
I'm just kind of getting that feeling that we're trying to almost plan it out.

474
00:52:10,027 --> 00:52:10,688
This is how,

475
00:52:11,648 --> 00:52:14,289
you know, we should do recess minute by minute.

476
00:52:15,110 --> 00:52:20,052
So there have been instances where unsafe behavior has occurred during recess.

477
00:52:20,912 --> 00:52:31,077
And my teachers have asked, can I administer a logical consequence, such as walking with the student to talk through the incident, and I have approved it.

478
00:52:31,897 --> 00:52:38,421
And I have kept a time bound, you know, take them on either a couple of laps or take them for three to five minutes.

479
00:52:39,041 --> 00:52:44,965
Once you feel the student is safe, then have them re-engage in recess.

480
00:52:45,425 --> 00:52:57,873
But I just would advocate that we do consider that the school has the responsibility to exercise all

481
00:52:59,456 --> 00:53:06,241
Logical is responsible for taking action steps to ensure the safety of all children during recess.

482
00:53:07,481 --> 00:53:10,423
So those- Thank you.

483
00:53:10,443 --> 00:53:11,024
Thank you.

484
00:53:11,084 --> 00:53:21,871
Before I go on to the next question, I will say, well, we certainly have not micromanaged because we haven't ever said a single word in policy as a school committee about recess in this district ever.

485
00:53:22,351 --> 00:53:24,353
It's not written down one word.

486
00:53:24,913 --> 00:53:28,936
So I'm not interested in going from one extreme to the other.

487
00:53:30,725 --> 00:53:39,470
as one member, I'm not interested in like slingshotting the entire, all of you all who have to manage these schools.

488
00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:40,870
It's not at all the goal.

489
00:53:41,591 --> 00:53:49,055
So I don't want you to be fearful that we're going to be providing you with a schedule of what kids should be doing every minute of their recess.

490
00:53:49,515 --> 00:53:54,618
First of all, we don't technically have such authority, I don't think, but I don't think that's what we want.

491
00:53:55,219 --> 00:53:57,460
So, member McLaughlin.

492
00:54:00,118 --> 00:54:00,518
Thank you.

493
00:54:00,538 --> 00:54:08,444
I want to just also comment on micromanaging I think that you know you guys are professionals we know that.

494
00:54:09,124 --> 00:54:16,049
And we know that you're got a lot of things that you're handling and a lot of balls in the air that you have to handle so and I know

495
00:54:16,871 --> 00:54:18,593
it takes more than one person, right?

496
00:54:18,633 --> 00:54:32,966
So it's not one principal, it's not one superintendent, it's not one school committee member, it's all of us together collectively as a community working on improving our schools and our BCBAs and our school adjustment counselors and all of those things that we clearly need.

497
00:54:33,006 --> 00:54:38,871
And so I guess to Mr. O'Brien's point, I would say, is there data collected on that?

498
00:54:38,931 --> 00:54:40,553
Because I think it would be really interesting.

499
00:54:40,593 --> 00:54:42,375
And I know you as educators know that

500
00:54:42,955 --> 00:54:43,915
data tells a story.

501
00:54:43,935 --> 00:54:46,576
And so really looking at what your data is telling you.

502
00:54:46,676 --> 00:54:51,857
So if you are doing, if teachers are doing that, what is the data telling you?

503
00:54:51,917 --> 00:54:53,618
Who are the people that that is happening to?

504
00:54:54,198 --> 00:54:55,538
Who are the teachers that are doing that?

505
00:54:55,938 --> 00:54:57,458
Is there disproportionality there?

506
00:54:57,558 --> 00:54:59,119
Is there not?

507
00:54:59,219 --> 00:55:02,620
I think that really sort of being able to have some of the data on that too is important.

508
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:07,741
And so that can help us really understand better.

509
00:55:07,781 --> 00:55:12,582
Because I think part of the, and I may be mistaken, but I think part of the reason that this is being brought

510
00:55:13,502 --> 00:55:14,623
to the policy floor.

511
00:55:14,843 --> 00:55:29,471
And part of it is because we didn't have one, but also because as school committee members and as community members, we hear, we do hear stories from families specifically around some of these consequences around recess.

512
00:55:30,452 --> 00:55:38,577
And we want to be able to bring families and schools together and families and administrators together to make sure that we're all coming up with effective solutions.

513
00:55:39,917 --> 00:55:50,599
I would just encourage if that was going to be the case, that data be collected and that somehow that data be disaggregated and shared so that we can understand what that is and what it looks like.

514
00:55:50,739 --> 00:55:51,039
Thanks.

515
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:52,640
Thank you.

516
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:55,040
Member Graham.

517
00:55:56,781 --> 00:55:57,221
Thank you.

518
00:55:58,661 --> 00:56:02,482
I also wanted to be unequivocally clear that

519
00:56:03,464 --> 00:56:07,747
We are not looking to micromanage anything, at least I am not.

520
00:56:07,767 --> 00:56:20,297
I would say that, if anything, my criticism is of the Medford School Committee, who it's 2022, and we don't have a policy on recess and we are an anomaly.

521
00:56:21,071 --> 00:56:30,242
So many, many, many, many, many, many districts have come before us and done this work and we never have and that's not on any of you that's on the school committee.

522
00:56:31,664 --> 00:56:38,111
But I think what we are trying to do is say we're all part we're all part of this ecosystem and we talked a lot about.

523
00:56:39,112 --> 00:56:50,700
accountability and consistency, and there is no way to have accountability and consistency unless there is a policy agreement that we are administering against.

524
00:56:50,920 --> 00:57:06,791
So I think this doesn't have to be onerous, and it doesn't have to be bad, and it certainly doesn't have to be micromanaging, but I do think it's important, if not, to make sure that you all have

525
00:57:07,672 --> 00:57:22,025
a policy to stand on and say this is the policy in the direction of the district, but also so that the community knows what that policy is and the community can alert you when something is happening that is outside of the bounds of that policy.

526
00:57:22,145 --> 00:57:26,509
Because I think we don't have a good track record in Medford of

527
00:57:28,302 --> 00:57:36,169
parents telling the administration in a forthright and direct manner when things are not going as they are expecting.

528
00:57:36,189 --> 00:57:38,151
And I think that's for a lot of reasons.

529
00:57:38,211 --> 00:57:45,918
And I think one of those reasons is everybody has different expectations because we as a district have never set the playing field of what those expectations are.

530
00:57:46,039 --> 00:57:47,860
So I think that's really important.

531
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:49,982
And when you do that, and when you can

532
00:57:50,963 --> 00:58:03,266
educate everybody on what that consistency looks like, you have a better chance of people believing you when you say, this is what we think, or this is how we behave.

533
00:58:03,886 --> 00:58:20,290
And because right now, we are just buried under example, after example, after example, and I'm not specifically talking about recess, I'm talking about district wide, of the ways we are inconsistent, or the ways that we are perceived to not be holding people accountable.

534
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:31,061
And I don't think anybody wants to operate this way at all because I think it's a really brutally painful way for for any organization to operate.

535
00:58:33,274 --> 00:58:38,016
So I guess I would say that we want to do this together.

536
00:58:40,918 --> 00:58:56,986
We are trying to do this so that we can set that tone of consistency, that you all have the same sort of definition of what that consistency is at the high level, and you can determine how to operationalize that in your buildings, which are quite different.

537
00:58:58,627 --> 00:59:09,030
You know, Andy, I am hopeful that the drainage issues that we've addressed will not make this so big of an issue for you this winter, but I know in the past it has been a sizable issue.

538
00:59:09,771 --> 00:59:16,933
And if we could buy Kirk another piece of land so that he had more space for recess, we should think about doing that too.

539
00:59:17,013 --> 00:59:21,855
Like there's a lot of operational issues that you all have to sort of figure out.

540
00:59:22,595 --> 00:59:46,380
but if you're all operating to the same consistent standard and you know what that is and the public knows what that is, I think we have a better chance of everybody being on the same page and you all being alerted when something isn't going right so that it can be figured out before somebody is, you know, 50 emails deep to the school committee and giving us a presentation about

541
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:59,190
You know, some, some issue or another, and I do think that sort of setting that tone and that tenor for for all of the work that we do from a policy perspective is important.

542
01:00:02,913 --> 01:00:09,716
should encourage you all to have conversations among yourselves about what you need from us to be able to be consistent.

543
01:00:10,216 --> 01:00:18,259
And if that is, I don't know what that is, like a functional playground, maybe on Andy's list right now, because he doesn't have one, right?

544
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:31,665
But there may be practical things that are different building to building in the endeavor for us to be consistent and to be looking at equity across the district where

545
01:00:32,245 --> 01:00:42,707
we need to give something different to the Missittuck than we need to give to the McGlynn because of the circumstances, but that that allows us all to sort of get to the same level playing field.

546
01:00:42,787 --> 01:00:46,948
So I am excited that we're doing this.

547
01:00:47,709 --> 01:01:00,812
I will say from a school committee perspective, it's very overdue as is the review of the vast majority of our policies or lack of policies since I've been on the committee and trying to work through these

548
01:01:02,452 --> 01:01:04,393
in some logical manner, I think is really important.

549
01:01:04,513 --> 01:01:08,676
So I am excited for the idea that we can get this done.

550
01:01:09,817 --> 01:01:21,464
If for no other reason than we can start communicating what these rules are so that parents can start to understand that consistency is a value that we hold and we're trying to take action against it.

551
01:01:23,865 --> 01:01:24,205
Thank you.

552
01:01:24,646 --> 01:01:24,906
Ms.

553
01:01:24,966 --> 01:01:27,948
Coluse.

554
01:01:28,628 --> 01:01:29,028
Thank you.

555
01:01:29,629 --> 01:01:30,629
And thank you, Member Graham.

556
01:01:30,729 --> 01:01:31,110
A lot of

557
01:01:32,892 --> 01:01:47,579
I was gonna kind of talk a little bit, one of the things I wanted to talk about was the consistency piece as well as the alignment is important in some of the autonomy because the spaces are so different is also important.

558
01:01:48,359 --> 01:02:00,145
And member McLaughlin spoke a little bit about the data and I'm all for data and I'm all for making sure that our expectations of what this time should be is aligned.

559
01:02:02,486 --> 01:02:11,777
But I also do want to like elevate again what Principal Demos said about that time being like individual.

560
01:02:12,238 --> 01:02:15,281
And so the individual needs of students are accounted for.

561
01:02:15,822 --> 01:02:20,668
And so it is hard to make a blanket statement sometimes about

562
01:02:23,534 --> 01:02:27,838
100% recess should not be used when children exhibit unsafe behaviors.

563
01:02:28,278 --> 01:02:35,324
Now the data piece is important to track that some of that is not unearthing a bigger problem.

564
01:02:36,565 --> 01:02:49,428
However, there has to be a level of flexibility in whatever it is that's going to be created within this group of people.

565
01:02:49,448 --> 01:02:57,330
And the other piece I just wanted to kind of punctuate a little bit is that I do find it unfortunate in a way that

566
01:02:58,646 --> 01:03:12,971
you're getting inundated with a lot of, you know, concerns or comments or phone calls or emails, because I would say it's also hard to fix something or work on something if it's not brought back to the principle.

567
01:03:13,711 --> 01:03:15,592
Now if it is brought back to the principle and

568
01:03:17,719 --> 01:03:19,260
that it's still not being addressed.

569
01:03:19,340 --> 01:03:20,180
That's another issue.

570
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:27,123
And then I feel like, you know, that is something that constituents and family members can go to you, can go to the superintendent.

571
01:03:27,703 --> 01:03:37,146
But really if parents are concerned about anything that's happening at recess, really the first person should be the teacher.

572
01:03:37,867 --> 01:03:41,328
And then if they're not satisfied with that, it should be the building principal.

573
01:03:41,848 --> 01:03:43,209
And the principal should be allowed

574
01:03:44,029 --> 01:03:48,752
and be given the opportunity to handle those concerns on an individual basis.

575
01:03:50,394 --> 01:03:55,958
And I just, I really wanted to make sure that, you know, that piece was kind of discussed as well.

576
01:03:56,158 --> 01:03:56,578
Thank you.

577
01:03:57,819 --> 01:03:58,219
Thank you.

578
01:03:58,239 --> 01:04:11,749
Before I go to Member McLaughlin, I will, you know, the, I don't remember if it's in the first 15 minutes of every school committee training, the one that all of us have to take away first, get elected, but that is,

579
01:04:12,528 --> 01:04:33,496
beaten over our heads that when we will be the people that naturally families will reach out to, because we live in the community and they may know us, and that our response should be to say, go to the teacher, then go to the principal, then the assistant superintendent, then the superintendent.

580
01:04:34,577 --> 01:04:40,219
And then when that's all not working, well, then come on back and visit us.

581
01:04:41,167 --> 01:04:51,137
It's really hard for us as members to do that because what we are hearing is a tiny slice of something super important for the family.

582
01:04:52,852 --> 01:04:56,333
with no context and with no ability to really get the context.

583
01:04:57,713 --> 01:05:03,795
And all of us on the school committee are here because we wanted to do this work and we wanted to help people and make schools better.

584
01:05:04,655 --> 01:05:09,596
And so it's like, go back and see these 12 people before you, you know, and I'll see you in six months.

585
01:05:09,696 --> 01:05:14,177
Like that's just a very unsatisfying answer as a school committee member, but it is something we

586
01:05:15,377 --> 01:05:33,561
I believe all of us on the school committee do try to do because, well, first of all, because we are trained that way, but also because we just often don't know enough to do much about it or to do the right thing.

587
01:05:33,581 --> 01:05:36,082
Anyways, Member McLaughlin.

588
01:05:39,773 --> 01:05:40,213
Thank you.

589
01:05:40,874 --> 01:05:50,423
Um, yeah, so I guess to that point in terms of the data, um, you know, some families may not know that their Children are not going to recess.

590
01:05:50,503 --> 01:05:59,672
So, you know, we do have some Children in the district who do not communicate with words who, you know, um, you know, are not able to tell their family if they went out to recess that day or not.

591
01:05:59,732 --> 01:06:04,556
So the question I have as well in terms of the data is our families being notified.

592
01:06:04,756 --> 01:06:05,237
You know, if

593
01:06:05,848 --> 01:06:08,492
their child is not allowed to go to recess and how.

594
01:06:08,632 --> 01:06:10,535
And so I guess that's a piece of it too.

595
01:06:11,296 --> 01:06:11,577
Thanks.

596
01:06:17,512 --> 01:06:17,932
Hi, Paul.

597
01:06:17,952 --> 01:06:25,515
I just wanted to say, as a former school committee member, that chart of the course rings true when you're saying that first day, right?

598
01:06:25,535 --> 01:06:34,159
So I remember the person that was running that class said to us as school committee members sitting in front of them, chart of the course is part of chain of communication.

599
01:06:34,219 --> 01:06:39,161
Just think of a C and a C and a C and a C. And he's like, it's going to be your best friend as a school committee going forward.

600
01:06:39,801 --> 01:06:43,383
And I've never forgotten that in all the years that I was the vice chair of the committee.

601
01:06:44,943 --> 01:06:55,268
I do say that I will agree with you that it is a difficult conversation when you're an elected official and you have members of the community that are looking forward for you to make a change and to help them advocate.

602
01:06:56,609 --> 01:07:02,132
One thing that I would do is I would ask those probing questions of, have you spoken with the classroom teacher?

603
01:07:02,172 --> 01:07:04,293
Have you talked to the principal?

604
01:07:04,413 --> 01:07:06,434
And did you get anywhere from there?

605
01:07:06,534 --> 01:07:07,955
And then send them back to that.

606
01:07:08,115 --> 01:07:13,238
I would then send an email to the principal and say, just want to let you know that, you know,

607
01:07:14,098 --> 01:07:28,720
So and so is in requesting some information in regards to recess, could you please reach out to them and then let me know when that's been handled, then I would reach out to the family and just say, had you had a successful conversation and kind of follow it up that way.

608
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:37,749
But I definitely think that when you said that chattering the course come comment it brought me back to that and I understand that that is a really hard place to be at.

609
01:07:38,210 --> 01:07:41,253
But as a sitting principal now and with my school committee head off.

610
01:07:41,693 --> 01:07:47,339
I totally appreciate that communication coming back and I don't mind if you just send an email or call that says, hey, by the way.

611
01:07:48,847 --> 01:07:56,250
I'm hearing from so-and-so about recess because I'm knocking on wood right now, but it isn't a topic that I hear from many families.

612
01:07:56,290 --> 01:08:04,813
So if you're getting emails and calls on your level that I can't help them at the building level, then I feel sort of bad about that because if I know I can help.

613
01:08:05,313 --> 01:08:08,334
So I do just appreciate you listening to that comment.

614
01:08:08,374 --> 01:08:08,714
Thank you.

615
01:08:10,015 --> 01:08:10,455
Thank you.

616
01:08:10,935 --> 01:08:13,016
Member McLaughlin, you have your hand up again.

617
01:08:15,197 --> 01:08:15,517
Where is that?

618
01:08:17,415 --> 01:08:18,756
No, it's from afar, thanks.

619
01:08:19,316 --> 01:08:20,637
Okay, thank you.

620
01:08:21,698 --> 01:08:22,478
Ms.

621
01:08:22,498 --> 01:08:24,299
Peliquin.

622
01:08:24,599 --> 01:08:29,442
I guess I don't see where this policy conversation is taking away any individual school choices.

623
01:08:30,062 --> 01:08:37,587
It seems that the conversation is about weather, punishment, and I would add screens during indoor recess.

624
01:08:37,667 --> 01:08:43,090
The focus of this meeting is not on individual activities at recess, but on inequitable access to the time itself.

625
01:08:45,111 --> 01:08:45,411
Thank you.

626
01:08:47,871 --> 01:08:54,556
I did have a question about the windblock analogy for recess.

627
01:08:55,897 --> 01:08:59,700
And I guess I'll just say it.

628
01:09:00,081 --> 01:09:02,723
Who gets to decide what the kid needs?

629
01:09:02,743 --> 01:09:07,787
Because it feels like if it's not the kid, then it's the opposite of child-directed.

630
01:09:09,608 --> 01:09:16,033
And I mean, if a child is during recess not able to play with

631
01:09:16,761 --> 01:09:21,044
other kids in a way that is working, however that is defined.

632
01:09:22,545 --> 01:09:30,591
And, you know, the natural responses of the other kids is not doing the educating that frankly probably happens a lot of the time.

633
01:09:31,992 --> 01:09:40,918
You know, I can see how the adults coming in to try and like help things get better if that's necessary, makes sense.

634
01:09:40,998 --> 01:09:44,681
But wind blocks, I guess it feels a bit like,

635
01:09:47,232 --> 01:09:48,373
Who gets to decide that?

636
01:09:48,553 --> 01:09:51,576
I mean, are kids really going like, I'm not gonna do recess today.

637
01:09:51,656 --> 01:10:01,285
I'm gonna go and do something that's not considered recess because an adult thought you needed more support in some other way.

638
01:10:01,305 --> 01:10:11,054
I don't really follow how it, my understanding of wind block is very much that the adults are saying, you know, my kid isn't getting this math concept and it's the wind block.

639
01:10:11,094 --> 01:10:13,296
So we're gonna go over the math concept during wind block.

640
01:10:13,711 --> 01:10:30,045
Right, so my comment, though, in regards to the wind block was more the fact that the students are given opportunities to choose what they're interested in in recess time that they have the fields, they have the playground, they have the bucket of supplies, they have the chalk, they can bring their library books.

641
01:10:30,802 --> 01:10:33,385
there are opportunities for them to make the choices.

642
01:10:33,845 --> 01:10:42,214
My point is, is that there are some students that struggle with making that decision and we have our professionals or staff that say to them, here's some opportunities that we have.

643
01:10:42,254 --> 01:10:43,495
What do you feel like playing today?

644
01:10:43,535 --> 01:10:45,377
Do you want to go and talk to so and so?

645
01:10:45,497 --> 01:10:46,639
They sort of guide it.

646
01:10:47,099 --> 01:10:54,445
But then they there are options out there for them readily available was my my analysis towards the wind block.

647
01:10:54,585 --> 01:11:07,214
It's not highly structured, but there I wanted to make the point that it doesn't look the same for every student at recess, because some kids are looking to get to that field as soon as they can, because they can't wait to start the soccer game when others can't.

648
01:11:07,775 --> 01:11:11,317
That is so overwhelming to them that they want the chalk at the loop.

649
01:11:11,357 --> 01:11:12,118
And that's OK, too.

650
01:11:13,033 --> 01:11:18,816
We don't want people to feel like they have to be, because your class is going out, this is what you have to play.

651
01:11:19,256 --> 01:11:20,277
That was more the analysis.

652
01:11:21,857 --> 01:11:22,197
Thank you.

653
01:11:22,237 --> 01:11:28,260
That makes much more sense.

654
01:11:28,881 --> 01:11:30,782
I guess it's about choice, not type of play.

655
01:11:30,802 --> 01:11:33,503
And this is something that grownups get mixed up all the time.

656
01:11:33,583 --> 01:11:40,726
And I think that the way we design play environments, this is coming up a lot with the McGlynn, is that playgrounds are designed for two types of play.

657
01:11:42,656 --> 01:11:45,598
As a play worker, we identify like 16 types of play.

658
01:11:46,078 --> 01:11:52,101
So play can be reading in the library because it's about choice and agency and how you're spending that time.

659
01:11:52,121 --> 01:11:58,925
So there are just many different types of play and grownups tend to only be like, they need to be running around.

660
01:11:59,325 --> 01:12:05,048
But some kids need just that time to sit under the structure and hang out with a friend and chat, and then that's okay too.

661
01:12:05,408 --> 01:12:07,409
Kids can be quiet, it can still be play.

662
01:12:09,237 --> 01:12:16,524
I think, Paul, your comment about kids needing support at recess is really important to think about, is what does a child need to be able to access recess?

663
01:12:17,024 --> 01:12:22,089
And that could be its own whole separate discussion other than this policy access piece.

664
01:12:24,111 --> 01:12:24,571
Thank you.

665
01:12:25,832 --> 01:12:26,493
We are at 513.

666
01:12:26,733 --> 01:12:28,675
Oh, Dr. Edward-Vinson.

667
01:12:31,464 --> 01:12:44,993
I was watching the clock as well but I wanted to say, just listening to today's conversation it was very rich there were a lot of different perspectives and things that were put forward for us to really be able to

668
01:12:46,034 --> 01:12:57,987
seriously consider and prepare for the next rules policy meeting to be discussing crafting a district wide policy.

669
01:12:58,707 --> 01:13:06,916
But I just wanted to say just listening to all of the different perspectives and what was said that it is not a one size fits all.

670
01:13:08,758 --> 01:13:20,825
you know, solution that whatever policy does end up being the final created policy, we do have to keep in mind that it will look different for different students.

671
01:13:21,566 --> 01:13:35,594
And the examples, again, of the library and students that I see who choose to not play and run at all, but just sit with one or two other friends and just, you know, enjoy the fresh air, but take advantage of that time together.

672
01:13:36,842 --> 01:14:04,143
So I think the next phase would be, and I don't know, Member Russo, if you'll be sending me one of the policies that you were looking at, or what it is that you're thinking about for a next step to be, where I'll be able to work with the administrative team as well, because there definitely are a lot of dimensions and layers, and we wanna be

673
01:14:05,224 --> 01:14:17,493
um, truly inclusive, um, in whatever policy ends up, um, being created, that it, it represents, um, all of our learners here within the district.

674
01:14:18,613 --> 01:14:18,954
Thank you.

675
01:14:19,014 --> 01:14:19,394
Thank you.

676
01:14:19,554 --> 01:14:20,314
Um, thank you.

677
01:14:20,475 --> 01:14:32,623
And, um, you know, we'll at the next meeting, we will talk about language, but I will tell you that when I looked at the recess policies and other districts, um, everybody will be happy to know that they were very, very

678
01:14:33,228 --> 01:14:35,449
brief.

679
01:14:35,949 --> 01:14:43,713
Even when they were very concise, you know, about what can or can't happen, they were very brief.

680
01:14:43,854 --> 01:14:47,555
And I think that that speaks to the fact that the policy is not implementation.

681
01:14:47,656 --> 01:14:55,920
So, you know, the concern certainly that, you know, the Roberts does not have the space that other schools have, or that the McGlynn

682
01:14:57,065 --> 01:14:59,186
is in a tough spot altogether.

683
01:14:59,206 --> 01:15:13,093
Those are implementation concerns, as long as the policy does not get so fine that it makes it impossible to implement in those two particular settings.

684
01:15:13,113 --> 01:15:18,156
I will certainly make sure, hopefully we will not go anywhere near

685
01:15:20,743 --> 01:15:23,044
you know, really, really detailed stuff.

686
01:15:23,144 --> 01:15:28,485
But, you know, I just have a short list of what's to include or discuss in the next meeting.

687
01:15:30,246 --> 01:15:35,307
Consistency of when is recess happening or not happening, I heard, as something to consider.

688
01:15:35,327 --> 01:15:43,089
And there are, there was a federally funded grant that created a fabulous chart that

689
01:15:44,225 --> 01:15:44,525
Saves.

690
01:15:44,885 --> 01:15:48,927
It's sort of like the real feel thing, but it's it's a little more complicated.

691
01:15:49,147 --> 01:15:51,848
And, you know, it tells you whether or not you're having recess or not.

692
01:15:53,609 --> 01:16:03,934
There's the definition of recess which There's the I think it'd be important to include a definition of what is not recess.

693
01:16:05,074 --> 01:16:13,416
plopping the kids down in the classroom or any other setting and putting a movie on isn't recess, whether or not it's that time of day.

694
01:16:14,816 --> 01:16:21,217
And so a definition of what is not recess, I said consistency already.

695
01:16:21,617 --> 01:16:33,500
And then we have to find a way to discuss when recess is, well, and honestly, all the other policies are very clear that recess will not be taken away for discipline.

696
01:16:35,105 --> 01:16:48,252
And so we will, I think we'll have to dig into that more, more at the next meeting as to what that looks like, because whether we need to support professional development for teachers so that there's classroom management.

697
01:16:48,272 --> 01:16:57,597
One of the things that in articles I've read very clear is If we can't take away recess, then we can't punish the kids or have any consequences at all.

698
01:16:57,877 --> 01:16:57,957
And

699
01:16:58,535 --> 01:17:02,019
I know that many of you all here are like, well, that doesn't make sense.

700
01:17:02,059 --> 01:17:05,322
There's lots of other ways to have consequences.

701
01:17:06,223 --> 01:17:18,375
But I think it's not fair to not recognize that there might be teachers that don't have necessarily all the skills to know that there are other options and how to do that.

702
01:17:18,996 --> 01:17:21,198
So I don't think teachers like

703
01:17:22,032 --> 01:17:23,813
look forward to taking away recess.

704
01:17:23,833 --> 01:17:25,754
That's, that's not a thing.

705
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:34,020
But if they honestly believe that's their only tool, then we need to make sure they understand and have the support to have other tools.

706
01:17:35,161 --> 01:17:46,148
So, and then, you know, we do want to talk about data, because, you know, if it while adding lots of more data entry and

707
01:17:46,852 --> 01:17:57,117
you know, forms to fill out, that all sounds terrible, but if it's once every six weeks a teacher is taking away recess, it's not too much to ask that a form be filled out.

708
01:17:57,658 --> 01:18:04,601
If it's three kids or six kids a day, well, that's a different problem.

709
01:18:05,962 --> 01:18:11,665
And I'd still support an excessively long form to fill out, like what's going on in that classroom.

710
01:18:11,685 --> 01:18:12,125
So,

711
01:18:14,191 --> 01:18:25,636
I think we should talk about data, what is not recess, what is recess, consistency, about when it happens.

712
01:18:26,697 --> 01:18:30,818
Am I missing anything for the next meeting?

713
01:18:31,879 --> 01:18:32,599
Member Rousseau.

714
01:18:33,420 --> 01:18:34,320
Yes, Member McLaughlin.

715
01:18:37,385 --> 01:18:38,486
Sorry, driving.

716
01:18:39,967 --> 01:18:50,934
I wanted to thank everyone for being here and thank you for recapping what we wanted to look at I'm wondering when you're saying the next meeting which meeting you mean, because there's lots of meetings.

717
01:18:51,255 --> 01:18:52,836
So that's one thing and then the other is.

718
01:18:55,017 --> 01:19:07,970
I love the idea of professional development and I know you know some people may grown at you know additional professional development, what have you, but having you know just come back from the mass association of school committees conference association of school superintendent conference.

719
01:19:08,470 --> 01:19:12,935
There were so many great sessions there and there were some sessions specific to this.

720
01:19:13,795 --> 01:19:19,336
and specific to just, you know, the social emotional needs of kids in our schools.

721
01:19:19,396 --> 01:19:36,920
And we know that we are in a mental health crisis around, you know, the pandemic and the data and what we're seeing in terms of data for increase in behavioral health supports and needs and counseling and, you know, hospitalization and suicides.

722
01:19:36,940 --> 01:19:41,621
And I mean, all of it, it's just off the hook as I'm sure you guys are dealing with every single day.

723
01:19:43,807 --> 01:19:50,970
I support very much the professional development piece, and I thank you for bringing that up, because I think it's an important piece.

724
01:19:52,731 --> 01:19:53,191
Thank you.

725
01:19:53,951 --> 01:20:03,695
Yes, so as for which next meeting, so I will, there's always so many meetings, but I will schedule another rules and policy subcommittee meeting.

726
01:20:04,495 --> 01:20:10,538
I don't have the date, so I have to reach out to see who is available and when, but where we will

727
01:20:11,562 --> 01:20:17,228
look at some of the other policies in surrounding districts, which is not an overwhelming effort since they're short, as I mentioned.

728
01:20:17,989 --> 01:20:27,299
And then we will draft some language to insert into our wellness policy, as well as update a few other things that are outdated from the template system.

729
01:20:29,132 --> 01:20:30,592
Anybody have any.

730
01:20:30,732 --> 01:20:31,973
Sorry, just for the rest of the room.

731
01:20:32,053 --> 01:20:34,253
And that's, that's all drafted in subcommittee.

732
01:20:34,273 --> 01:20:37,574
But then that has to go before our entire committee.

733
01:20:37,674 --> 01:20:41,894
And then they, you know, based on recommendations or not, vote on it.

734
01:20:41,954 --> 01:20:45,095
So this is not a final, you know, process.

735
01:20:45,175 --> 01:20:47,415
It's just one step in the next process.

736
01:20:48,575 --> 01:20:48,896
Correct.

737
01:20:48,916 --> 01:20:49,096
Yes.

738
01:20:49,136 --> 01:20:50,096
Thank you for that.

739
01:20:50,136 --> 01:20:50,736
I always forget.

740
01:20:50,776 --> 01:20:53,256
Not everybody knows the whole process.

741
01:20:53,836 --> 01:20:57,217
And so does anybody have any final words they want to add?

742
01:20:59,902 --> 01:21:01,023
I don't see any hands.

743
01:21:01,323 --> 01:21:05,725
All right, well, I'm thrilled to say that we are nine minutes early.

744
01:21:05,945 --> 01:21:09,627
Oh, I need to take a... Thank you.

745
01:21:09,687 --> 01:21:10,448
Motion to adjourn.

746
01:21:11,148 --> 01:21:11,768
Yeah, second.

747
01:21:13,849 --> 01:21:15,670
All right, member Graham.

748
01:21:16,151 --> 01:21:16,411
Yes.

749
01:21:17,892 --> 01:21:18,652
Member McLaughlin.

750
01:21:19,492 --> 01:21:19,833
Yes.

751
01:21:20,893 --> 01:21:21,874
Member Rousseau, yes.

752
01:21:22,194 --> 01:21:23,555
Thank you everyone for coming.

753
01:21:23,575 --> 01:21:24,375
Thanks everyone.

754
01:21:24,575 --> 01:21:27,837

755
01:21:28,657 --> 01:21:29,198
