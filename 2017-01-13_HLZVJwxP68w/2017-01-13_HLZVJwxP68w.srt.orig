[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

22
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:14,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, those who don't know, we had a meeting this evening, uh, to adopt some new rules for the taxi rates and the council and with the chief.

23
00:01:15,245 --> 00:01:21,009
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh, on councilor Knight's motion seconded by councilor Della Russo.

24
00:01:21,472 --> 00:01:26,915
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President, if I may, um, the city clerk's going to provide the language changes and include that in the minutes of a next month, next week's meeting.

25
00:01:27,335 --> 00:01:31,317
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, so everybody will have a chance to take a look at them in their full text and then we can move for a vote next week.

26
00:01:31,657 --> 00:01:32,097
[SPEAKER_04]: All in favor.

27
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:36,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice president marks.

28
00:01:36,939 --> 00:01:37,720
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

29
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,161
[SPEAKER_16]: I just want to personally thank the subcommittee on licensing.

30
00:01:41,842 --> 00:01:46,444
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, as we probably all know in this community, uh, the taxi license,

31
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:50,888
[SPEAKER_16]: Ordinance hasn't been reviewed or looked at in many, many years.

32
00:01:51,728 --> 00:01:54,368
[SPEAKER_16]: And they did their homework and their due diligence.

33
00:01:55,148 --> 00:02:08,471
[SPEAKER_16]: And I believe they came out with an acceptable ordinance that updates taxi licenses in this community and also provides more accessibility for those that may have a handicap in this community.

34
00:02:08,551 --> 00:02:13,592
[SPEAKER_16]: So I wanted to personally thank the licensing subcommittee for their due diligence, Mr. President.

35
00:02:16,924 --> 00:02:17,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, second.

36
00:02:18,485 --> 00:02:18,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

37
00:02:19,646 --> 00:02:20,127
[SPEAKER_04]: All in favor?

38
00:02:20,967 --> 00:02:21,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

39
00:02:21,187 --> 00:02:22,649
[SPEAKER_04]: Opposed, none.

40
00:02:22,929 --> 00:02:23,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

41
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,951
[SPEAKER_05]: While we're on to suspension, Mr. President.

42
00:02:27,132 --> 00:02:28,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Councilor Del Rosso.

43
00:02:28,594 --> 00:02:37,461
[SPEAKER_05]: While we're on to suspension, Mr. President, I respectfully request that we take item number 16-789 from the table for consideration.

44
00:02:37,481 --> 00:02:38,642
[SPEAKER_04]: 16-789, transfer.

45
00:02:38,662 --> 00:02:38,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

46
00:02:38,862 --> 00:02:39,602
[SPEAKER_04]: Second by Councilor.

47
00:02:39,663 --> 00:02:42,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Transfer $900,000 from retained water earnings

48
00:02:47,502 --> 00:02:49,623
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Manningman, madam engineer.

49
00:02:49,683 --> 00:03:06,011
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, uh, in, uh, the last, uh, year at the end of the year, we had a presentation from, uh, the mayor's office through the city engineer, uh, to discuss and review, uh, matters pertaining to the, uh, Brownfield and West Medford.

50
00:03:06,191 --> 00:03:06,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

51
00:03:06,712 --> 00:03:15,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, we had asked, uh, for some, uh, reports from the, uh, city engineer and she provided them to us in our last week's packet.

52
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:27,912
[SPEAKER_05]: and we've had them over the weekend in answer to some of the questions that the counselors had asked in helping them consider their decision with regards to this matter of justice.

53
00:03:27,932 --> 00:03:28,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

54
00:03:31,413 --> 00:03:32,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address of the record, please.

55
00:03:32,393 --> 00:03:38,974
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, good evening.

56
00:03:39,014 --> 00:03:41,914
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, I couldn't hear the screen.

57
00:03:41,934 --> 00:03:42,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I done?

58
00:03:42,234 --> 00:03:42,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Your mic should be on.

59
00:03:42,675 --> 00:03:43,595
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, I couldn't hear the screen.

60
00:03:43,615 --> 00:03:43,755
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

61
00:03:43,795 --> 00:03:45,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on, hold on.

62
00:03:49,635 --> 00:03:50,636
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, good enough.

63
00:03:51,036 --> 00:03:52,797
[SPEAKER_14]: Cassandra Cudelita, City Engineer.

64
00:03:53,777 --> 00:03:55,358
[SPEAKER_14]: Alicia Nunley, Finance Director.

65
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:08,666
[SPEAKER_12]: So, Your Honorable Body, we did come before you in December, and I wanted to just add two additional comments from the last presentation.

66
00:04:09,186 --> 00:04:17,011
[SPEAKER_12]: One is that we had a conference call yesterday with our EPA representative, and she's very concerned about this project getting started.

67
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:26,602
[SPEAKER_12]: We have exceeded our three-year time frame for the grant, and we received an extension, but it would be difficult to get a second extension.

68
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:33,007
[SPEAKER_12]: We have just a one-year extension right now, and anything that would go beyond that may have to go to headquarters to be approved.

69
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:36,190
[SPEAKER_12]: Anything that would be a second one-year extension would have to go to headquarters.

70
00:04:37,091 --> 00:04:43,917
[SPEAKER_12]: And there is concern and review at EPA now about funds that are sitting in accounts that are not being utilized.

71
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:49,794
[SPEAKER_12]: The second piece is that we are looking at a time that is ripe for beginning work.

72
00:04:51,135 --> 00:04:54,897
[SPEAKER_12]: In the spring, the high groundwater table is the time that you want to start.

73
00:04:55,598 --> 00:05:04,764
[SPEAKER_12]: So if we weren't to start this spring, we're trying to catch that schedule, we would be faced with waiting perhaps another calendar year before we could look at this again.

74
00:05:05,185 --> 00:05:10,208
[SPEAKER_12]: And then that would put us in a tenuous position with EPA.

75
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:13,530
[SPEAKER_12]: So I wanted to bring that to your attention.

76
00:05:13,991 --> 00:05:14,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

77
00:05:15,681 --> 00:05:16,461
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor DelaRusso.

78
00:05:17,021 --> 00:05:41,070
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, if I could, through the chair, ask the city engineer, are you convinced that this course of action which is being presented to us is the right course of action to take given the options that you're aware of in treating a situation such as this, a site such as this, and given the time that this has gone on,

79
00:05:41,752 --> 00:05:45,713
[SPEAKER_05]: and hasn't had a lot of action except testing and monitoring.

80
00:05:46,393 --> 00:06:02,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Where we have a treatment and mitigation plan, are you confident that this is the city's best option to pursue and that this is something for the sake of justice for the residents and property owners over there that we should undertake?

81
00:06:03,876 --> 00:06:04,897
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, through the chair.

82
00:06:05,137 --> 00:06:11,118
[SPEAKER_12]: I feel confident that we have selected an alternative that is cost effective.

83
00:06:12,294 --> 00:06:14,256
[SPEAKER_12]: And we'll work in a timely manner.

84
00:06:14,356 --> 00:06:17,739
[SPEAKER_12]: We have been in consultation with DEP.

85
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:23,204
[SPEAKER_12]: They have quite a bit of experience beyond us in handling these types of projects.

86
00:06:23,224 --> 00:06:34,514
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, chemical oxidation is very well known, very successful, good at treating this contaminant, good at getting into tight spots, which is underneath the building.

87
00:06:35,515 --> 00:06:38,318
[SPEAKER_05]: And I notice in the packet that you provided to us that there was a

88
00:06:39,328 --> 00:06:50,998
[SPEAKER_05]: This, in particular, has been tremendously helpful in urban areas, in densely populated urban areas where there's been great success.

89
00:06:51,758 --> 00:06:59,044
[SPEAKER_05]: And this, if I understand correctly, again, through the chair, this is helpful for the environment as well.

90
00:06:59,244 --> 00:07:08,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Not only does it mitigate and clean up this contamination, but the means by which it's done is not invasive to the environment either.

91
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:09,550
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

92
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:27,775
[SPEAKER_12]: Through the chair, we received an award from DEP, uh, and the LSP association for this being called a greener cleanup, instead of trying to excavate and haul tons of soil out and haul it, you know, uh, thousands of miles away to a hazardous waste landfill, we're able to treat it on site.

93
00:07:28,435 --> 00:07:36,018
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, we might've mentioned to you in our last presentation that this is a contaminant that is migrating offsite, heading toward the street.

94
00:07:36,098 --> 00:07:37,318
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, we don't want it to be,

95
00:07:37,968 --> 00:07:48,058
[SPEAKER_12]: It's something that we're going to have to encounter in the future when we're doing any water utility work or sewer work with the attendant health and safety issues and dealing with the hazardous waste we have to dispose of.

96
00:07:48,118 --> 00:07:49,779
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's a greener cleanup.

97
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,062
[SPEAKER_12]: It is effective.

98
00:07:52,262 --> 00:07:54,104
[SPEAKER_12]: The chemicals have been studied.

99
00:07:54,584 --> 00:07:56,706
[SPEAKER_12]: They've gone through bench tests and pilot tests.

100
00:07:56,726 --> 00:08:00,730
[SPEAKER_12]: They've figured out how much they have to pump into the ground to get it to where they want it to go.

101
00:08:01,369 --> 00:08:02,729
[SPEAKER_12]: Nobody can see underground.

102
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:09,252
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, you can do the best you can with what you know, but we have a pretty robust design.

103
00:08:10,352 --> 00:08:10,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

104
00:08:10,932 --> 00:08:12,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, I move approval.

105
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:15,173
[SPEAKER_16]: Vice President Mox.

106
00:08:16,034 --> 00:08:16,954
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

107
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:29,358
[SPEAKER_16]: Cassandra, what plans are being made to alleviate some of the concerns for parking now that that lot will be under repair?

108
00:08:31,394 --> 00:08:36,475
[SPEAKER_12]: Through the chair, we're working on this one step at a time.

109
00:08:36,575 --> 00:08:38,936
[SPEAKER_12]: Right now, the procurement documents are being prepared.

110
00:08:38,996 --> 00:08:44,177
[SPEAKER_12]: We have talked about one potential location for temporary parking.

111
00:08:45,037 --> 00:08:54,339
[SPEAKER_12]: And my next task, once we have approval, if we do get approval tonight, is to focus on what we're going to do during the time that the parking lot is inaccessible.

112
00:08:55,059 --> 00:08:58,139
[SPEAKER_16]: So you will have an alternate parking plan?

113
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:01,140
[SPEAKER_12]: My hope is that we will identify

114
00:09:01,668 --> 00:09:03,429
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, sufficient alternative parking.

115
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:07,272
[SPEAKER_16]: Which site are you currently looking at?

116
00:09:08,152 --> 00:09:15,237
[SPEAKER_12]: There was discussion, and I don't have current information on it, but using the funeral home for some parking.

117
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:18,939
[SPEAKER_16]: And you've been in discussions with the owner?

118
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,180
[SPEAKER_12]: I personally have not.

119
00:09:21,581 --> 00:09:22,982
[SPEAKER_12]: That was the previous administration.

120
00:09:26,158 --> 00:09:45,108
[SPEAKER_16]: I would ask Mr. President that as, as part of this approval, that, uh, the council be updated on, uh, what, uh, alternative plans are going to be out for parking, uh, whether it's maybe a loosening up some of, uh, the parking that's going on right now through park method or that an additional site be provided.

121
00:09:45,548 --> 00:09:54,773
[SPEAKER_16]: And also that a periodic updates be sent to the director butters who are most impacted Mr. President on, uh, the progress of this project.

122
00:09:55,225 --> 00:09:56,406
[SPEAKER_16]: as well as the city council.

123
00:09:57,166 --> 00:10:05,169
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would ask that that, that to, uh, I'd like to have a meeting, um, with the, all the residents in that area, the businesses.

124
00:10:05,649 --> 00:10:17,154
[SPEAKER_04]: So they know what, uh, the timing of this and the actual impact rather than just, uh, you know, given, uh, I think the businesses all should be notified, uh, and have a public meeting.

125
00:10:17,635 --> 00:10:20,596
[SPEAKER_04]: So they all know, uh, what's going to be going on and in,

126
00:10:21,176 --> 00:10:31,620
[SPEAKER_04]: the parking arrangements, and I would hope that we would waive the metering during that time while this project is going on also.

127
00:10:32,701 --> 00:10:35,322
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you wouldn't mind adding that onto your.

128
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:41,084
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that's mostly what I said, but I'd be more than happy to add that.

129
00:10:42,445 --> 00:10:42,885
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight.

130
00:10:43,668 --> 00:10:50,811
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President, I think there's also the underlying issue of those who have purchased business permits that operate businesses down there and own business permits and rely on that lot.

131
00:10:50,871 --> 00:10:54,692
[SPEAKER_06]: So similar to the metering and the alternative parking plan, I think this is a great idea.

132
00:10:54,712 --> 00:10:56,132
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this is the direction that we need to go in.

133
00:10:56,472 --> 00:10:58,633
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm certainly in favor of the paper.

134
00:10:58,673 --> 00:11:03,895
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel as though this environmental issue down here needs to be addressed, and it needs to be addressed sooner rather than later.

135
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:07,276
[SPEAKER_06]: And the alternative parking plan, I think, is the sticking point.

136
00:11:07,356 --> 00:11:10,057
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is something that I think is important, but I also think it's a great idea.

137
00:11:10,464 --> 00:11:17,246
[SPEAKER_06]: and I think it's a good, happy medium so that we can move forward and get the construction work done while at the same time addressing some of the concerns in the business district.

138
00:11:20,006 --> 00:11:20,306
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

139
00:11:20,926 --> 00:11:24,067
[SPEAKER_04]: On Councilor DelaRusso's motion, do I have a second?

140
00:11:25,788 --> 00:11:26,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

141
00:11:26,388 --> 00:11:27,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Second by Councilor Falco.

142
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:34,970
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

143
00:11:36,137 --> 00:11:37,018
[SPEAKER_09]: Name and address of the record, please.

144
00:11:37,078 --> 00:11:42,241
[SPEAKER_09]: My name, my name is Robert Penter, zero summit road method, Massachusetts, former member of this board.

145
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:49,185
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I have no question about remediate, uh, remediating the land, but there are some issues here that haven't been resolved.

146
00:11:49,265 --> 00:11:52,106
[SPEAKER_09]: And two of them in particular were brought up at the December meeting.

147
00:11:52,286 --> 00:12:05,614
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, where's the law that allows for this number one and where was, and where's the public hearing on a March 14th of 2014 in a meeting that took place with the Medford office of environmental affairs.

148
00:12:06,607 --> 00:12:08,907
[SPEAKER_09]: There were a host of folks that were there, including myself.

149
00:12:09,848 --> 00:12:13,248
[SPEAKER_09]: And in there, there was an EPA rules and regulation that basically states the following.

150
00:12:14,349 --> 00:12:24,291
[SPEAKER_09]: EPA regulation states that there will be a public meeting that will be advertised through the standard public meeting notification channels.

151
00:12:25,171 --> 00:12:35,153
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was in reference to the fact that just what you asked about, Mr. President, and for the public, there is yet to be a public hearing meeting regarding this amount of money of $900,000

152
00:12:36,777 --> 00:12:38,037
[SPEAKER_09]: for this particular transfer.

153
00:12:38,937 --> 00:12:46,119
[SPEAKER_09]: It was stated and quoted at the last meeting, there would be anywheres from between 75 to 100 injection points that would be placed into the ground.

154
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:55,821
[SPEAKER_09]: Brown and Caldwell, who we spent well over $100,000, indicated that that would take two drilling rigs in no more than 10 to 15 days.

155
00:12:56,481 --> 00:13:00,642
[SPEAKER_09]: You were told this past December it would take approximately a month of disruption.

156
00:13:01,122 --> 00:13:02,842
[SPEAKER_09]: That goes to your point, Councilman Longs.

157
00:13:03,822 --> 00:13:05,423
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, the soil depth of 20 to 25 feet,

158
00:13:07,573 --> 00:13:21,139
[SPEAKER_09]: which is found on the GZA report, indicates that their cost, their estimation, and they were the people that reviewed the Brown and Caulfield, their cost was between $2.4 to $2.9 million.

159
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:25,681
[SPEAKER_09]: Brown and Caulfield said it would cost the city approximately $1.8 million.

160
00:13:26,381 --> 00:13:30,143
[SPEAKER_09]: And you're looking at $900,000 that's now being presented before you.

161
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:34,244
[SPEAKER_09]: So these are issues that I think that still needs to be addressed.

162
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:35,565
[SPEAKER_09]: And also,

163
00:13:37,273 --> 00:13:43,738
[SPEAKER_09]: The city of Medford had a projected analysis that took place in August, July of 2015, for which I have here.

164
00:13:44,318 --> 00:13:45,359
[SPEAKER_09]: It talks about the cost.

165
00:13:45,419 --> 00:13:47,260
[SPEAKER_09]: It talks about the remediation.

166
00:13:48,121 --> 00:13:59,950
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, I spoke to the Bureau of Accounts at the Department of Revenue, and they have a rule and regulation that is very specific as it relates to what you can and cannot do as it relates to this particular thing.

167
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:03,112
[SPEAKER_09]: It's guideline 08-101.

168
00:14:03,632 --> 00:14:06,995
[SPEAKER_09]: And it says, for what services can a community adopt an enterprise fund?

169
00:14:07,874 --> 00:14:09,194
[SPEAKER_09]: It goes into all the issues.

170
00:14:09,814 --> 00:14:10,875
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, no, we're different.

171
00:14:10,935 --> 00:14:24,038
[SPEAKER_09]: But then it says the community may not, may not establish enterprise funds for normal government operations or services, such as public safety, inspectional services, or cemeteries.

172
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:35,441
[SPEAKER_09]: We're talking about something here that's remediation of land, dirty soil, before you even get down to 20 to 25 feet of wherever that water might be.

173
00:14:36,401 --> 00:14:37,041
[SPEAKER_09]: You cannot.

174
00:14:38,297 --> 00:14:49,981
[SPEAKER_09]: and I defy anyone here to show me a case or an authorization where enterprise funds money, water and sewer enterprise funds money were used to remediate dirty soil that's there.

175
00:14:50,981 --> 00:14:53,042
[SPEAKER_09]: You were there right from the beginning, Councilor Caviello.

176
00:14:53,162 --> 00:14:54,543
[SPEAKER_09]: You heard the commentary.

177
00:14:54,943 --> 00:14:57,003
[SPEAKER_09]: You saw the businesses that have been affected.

178
00:14:57,884 --> 00:15:07,327
[SPEAKER_09]: If you go forward with this vote tonight without having a legal determination that it can be done, and also without contacting the Department of Revenue, Division of Local Services,

179
00:15:07,642 --> 00:15:16,908
[SPEAKER_09]: and explain to them this is the reason why you want to spend your $900,000 out of an enterprise fund for which they can give you an opinion whether you can or cannot do it.

180
00:15:16,968 --> 00:15:18,470
[SPEAKER_09]: And we had this conversation in December.

181
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:25,294
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a little bit shocked that both of these young ladies that work for the mayor haven't brought any of that information forward that would justify.

182
00:15:25,915 --> 00:15:29,897
[SPEAKER_09]: So all that seems to take place that took place in December and now, nothing has changed.

183
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:33,560
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just sat on the table, and whatever packet of information you got,

184
00:15:34,176 --> 00:15:35,537
[SPEAKER_09]: over the weekend, so be it.

185
00:15:36,117 --> 00:15:37,638
[SPEAKER_09]: But you have a legal quandary here.

186
00:15:37,658 --> 00:15:39,519
[SPEAKER_09]: And you're talking about the taxpayers' money.

187
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:43,902
[SPEAKER_09]: You're talking about approximately $8 million that's in free cash that could be used for this.

188
00:15:44,622 --> 00:15:55,468
[SPEAKER_09]: And as the law so states, unless there's something on the boards, on the boards within 90 days for water and sewer street reconstruction, that money has to go back to the ratepayers because it's a surplus.

189
00:15:56,009 --> 00:15:58,890
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a surplus that the ratepayers have been overcharged with.

190
00:16:00,051 --> 00:16:02,032
[SPEAKER_09]: The intent of the project sounds good.

191
00:16:02,365 --> 00:16:04,026
[SPEAKER_09]: cleaning up the property and moving forward.

192
00:16:04,446 --> 00:16:06,287
[SPEAKER_09]: But there's a process that needs to take place.

193
00:16:07,027 --> 00:16:26,656
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would strongly suggest to you, since you don't have any legal determination, nothing from the Department of Revenue, a Bureau of Accounts standard that's operational each and every day for all cities and towns as it relates to enterprise funds, I would suggest that you, instead of take the money out of the enterprise fund, you take it out of your free cash.

194
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:30,058
[SPEAKER_09]: Or before you even go one step further, so be it.

195
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:35,343
[SPEAKER_09]: To say that, you know, it's, it's three years overdue and now we're going to get an extension.

196
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,424
[SPEAKER_09]: Whose fault is it for three years overdue?

197
00:16:38,444 --> 00:16:40,264
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the council has been asking.

198
00:16:40,304 --> 00:16:44,326
[SPEAKER_09]: I know when I was on here, I went to all those meetings and there was supposed to be updated meetings.

199
00:16:44,886 --> 00:16:46,107
[SPEAKER_09]: You haven't had the public hearing.

200
00:16:46,827 --> 00:16:55,850
[SPEAKER_09]: That's an EPA regulation and rule requirement for the community as a whole, for the businesses, so they can understand what's going on and to get some input.

201
00:16:56,911 --> 00:16:58,111
[SPEAKER_09]: Where's the input from the community?

202
00:16:58,912 --> 00:16:59,812
[SPEAKER_09]: Where's the public hearing?

203
00:17:00,837 --> 00:17:12,840
[SPEAKER_09]: And why, at this point in time, would you even want to take a chance in having the State Department of Revenue question you when it comes to do your annual assessment on money and budget projections coming back to the city of Medford?

204
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,100
[SPEAKER_09]: I say this with all due respect to the board.

205
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:23,242
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds good that people are going to say, well, all of a sudden we're going to get the land, we're going to get the West Medford parking lot, and the brownfields remediated for $900,000.

206
00:17:24,022 --> 00:17:28,603
[SPEAKER_09]: You have two figures from two outside concerns, $1.9 million on one,

207
00:17:29,763 --> 00:17:33,345
[SPEAKER_09]: anywhere from 2.2 to 2.5, 2.6 on another.

208
00:17:34,685 --> 00:17:36,987
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think somebody needs to explain to you the difference.

209
00:17:37,847 --> 00:17:38,827
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got everything right here.

210
00:17:38,888 --> 00:17:42,849
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd be more than happy to spend hours with you to explain and tell you what the differences are.

211
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:45,111
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think that's your job right now.

212
00:17:45,951 --> 00:17:51,274
[SPEAKER_09]: And your job is to make sure that you make an intelligent decision, not a decision that's been hanging around since December.

213
00:17:51,534 --> 00:17:56,816
[SPEAKER_09]: And you still, you still don't have the appropriate information to make this vote this evening.

214
00:17:57,557 --> 00:17:57,857
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

215
00:17:59,025 --> 00:18:00,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Madam budget director, would you like to speak on that?

216
00:18:05,607 --> 00:18:07,048
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, honorable chair and counselors.

217
00:18:07,228 --> 00:18:14,790
[SPEAKER_14]: I did provide a memo and I did contact DOR legal that it is legal for us to use retained earnings as I, as I provided you in the memo.

218
00:18:16,051 --> 00:18:16,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

219
00:18:16,431 --> 00:18:16,791
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

220
00:18:18,011 --> 00:18:19,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

221
00:18:22,493 --> 00:18:23,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Del Rosso.

222
00:18:23,553 --> 00:18:23,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

223
00:18:24,414 --> 00:18:25,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Falco.

224
00:18:25,154 --> 00:18:25,214
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

225
00:18:26,194 --> 00:18:26,774
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Knight.

226
00:18:26,854 --> 00:18:27,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

227
00:18:27,615 --> 00:18:28,355
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Kern.

228
00:18:28,395 --> 00:18:28,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

229
00:18:29,561 --> 00:18:30,322
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Mox.

230
00:18:30,782 --> 00:18:30,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

231
00:18:31,823 --> 00:18:32,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Scarpelli.

232
00:18:32,743 --> 00:18:32,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

233
00:18:33,704 --> 00:18:34,464
[SPEAKER_02]: President Caviello.

234
00:18:34,825 --> 00:18:35,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

235
00:18:35,445 --> 00:18:38,647
[SPEAKER_04]: A vote of six in the affirmative, one absent.

236
00:18:39,267 --> 00:18:40,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

237
00:18:42,449 --> 00:18:50,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion by Councilor Scarpelli to revert back to regular business.

238
00:18:50,074 --> 00:18:53,356
[SPEAKER_04]: 17-017 offered by Councilor Falco.

239
00:18:53,836 --> 00:18:57,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas each neighborhood throughout the city is the experience

240
00:18:57,966 --> 00:18:59,427
[SPEAKER_04]: experiencing increased traffic.

241
00:18:59,607 --> 00:19:06,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas the traffic issues in the city of Medford have had a negative impact on the quality of life of our residents.

242
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:15,332
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas traffic and traffic related issues are continuing to grow due to development throughout the city of Medford.

243
00:19:15,392 --> 00:19:25,876
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it resolved that Mayor Burke appropriate the funding for a traffic engineer or have a traffic engineer on retainer included in the fiscal 2018 budget.

244
00:19:29,222 --> 00:19:30,023
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Falco.

245
00:19:30,823 --> 00:19:31,624
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

246
00:19:31,924 --> 00:19:35,126
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, but a year ago I offered a similar, similar resolution.

247
00:19:35,146 --> 00:19:42,892
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, because I believe that the traffic in our community is really having a negative impact on all neighborhoods throughout our community.

248
00:19:44,273 --> 00:19:47,075
[SPEAKER_10]: The traffic engineer, in my opinion, is needed now more than ever.

249
00:19:47,856 --> 00:19:55,221
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, the past year I've received like many of my colleagues, uh, many emails, phone calls, just conversations on the street about traffic.

250
00:19:55,966 --> 00:20:03,789
[SPEAKER_10]: traffic patterns, car crashes, pedestrians being hit by cars, and just pedestrian issues in general.

251
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:09,052
[SPEAKER_10]: These issues could have been addressed by a traffic engineer.

252
00:20:10,312 --> 00:20:19,456
[SPEAKER_10]: For the past six months, I've worked with the Medford Police Department and Chief Sago on bringing the monthly neighborhood meetings to different sections of the community.

253
00:20:20,216 --> 00:20:23,718
[SPEAKER_10]: We've had meetings in West Medford at the Brooks School, North Medford at St.

254
00:20:23,758 --> 00:20:24,158
[SPEAKER_10]: Francis,

255
00:20:24,639 --> 00:20:30,182
[SPEAKER_10]: down in Wellington at the Andrews Middle School, and most recently here in South Medford at the South Medford Fire Station.

256
00:20:30,623 --> 00:20:33,545
[SPEAKER_10]: And a common theme has emerged in each of these meetings.

257
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:40,869
[SPEAKER_10]: It is basically traffic, traffic congestion, and traffic-related issues, and in general, public safety with regards to traffic.

258
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:46,132
[SPEAKER_10]: We have over 57,000 residents, 57 miles of road, 50 miles of sidewalks.

259
00:20:46,593 --> 00:20:49,555
[SPEAKER_10]: We have five state roads that cut through our city.

260
00:20:49,995 --> 00:20:50,635
[SPEAKER_10]: Route 16, 28, 38, 16, Route 93,

261
00:20:53,880 --> 00:21:01,023
[SPEAKER_10]: And on top of that, Route 93 has four off ramps that continuously unload traffic onto our local streets.

262
00:21:02,724 --> 00:21:07,026
[SPEAKER_10]: In my discussions with Chief Sacco, he agrees that we need to hire a traffic engineer.

263
00:21:07,126 --> 00:21:09,987
[SPEAKER_10]: This should be a priority in the next budget, without a doubt.

264
00:21:11,248 --> 00:21:19,071
[SPEAKER_10]: I give all the credit in the world to Chief Sacco, Sergeant Hartnett, Officer Brooks, for what they've been doing so far to help resolve some of the traffic issues.

265
00:21:19,592 --> 00:21:22,633
[SPEAKER_10]: But we don't have anyone in this city

266
00:21:23,097 --> 00:21:30,223
[SPEAKER_10]: that basically has the educational background or that has studied traffic or that is a technically a traffic engineer.

267
00:21:30,703 --> 00:21:31,904
[SPEAKER_10]: And that is what we really need.

268
00:21:32,545 --> 00:21:37,509
[SPEAKER_10]: And, uh, you know, this traffic is a major problem that's been plaguing our community in the worst is yet to come.

269
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:40,731
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, you know, methods only seven miles from Boston.

270
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:43,734
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a major cut fruit for all surrounding cities and towns.

271
00:21:45,115 --> 00:21:45,715
[SPEAKER_10]: It's run a city.

272
00:21:45,735 --> 00:21:47,717
[SPEAKER_10]: There are major plans for development.

273
00:21:48,967 --> 00:22:01,012
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, if you take, for hundreds of units, if you take a look at Rivers Edge, 350 units, Middlesex Ave, 200 units, possibly 500 units on Locust Street, more development on Salem Street and in West Medford.

274
00:22:01,512 --> 00:22:10,396
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, as these developers look to add housing to our neighborhoods, you know, there's no one representing our city with regard to traffic.

275
00:22:11,097 --> 00:22:19,723
[SPEAKER_10]: The developers come in, and they want to do whatever they want, but we have no one in this city that is qualified to look at traffic and traffic patterns.

276
00:22:20,363 --> 00:22:21,804
[SPEAKER_10]: We need someone to represent us.

277
00:22:22,444 --> 00:22:27,007
[SPEAKER_10]: In my opinion, a traffic engineer needs to be added in the upcoming budget.

278
00:22:27,107 --> 00:22:30,049
[SPEAKER_10]: Funds need to be appropriated by the mayor, and we must act now.

279
00:22:32,311 --> 00:22:34,132
[SPEAKER_10]: We can only take a look at what's happening in our city.

280
00:22:35,012 --> 00:22:40,636
[SPEAKER_10]: We cannot only take a look at what's happening in our city, but we have to take a look at the surrounding cities as well.

281
00:22:41,275 --> 00:22:44,857
[SPEAKER_10]: You have possible development at the New England Memorial Hospital in Stoneham.

282
00:22:45,358 --> 00:22:47,599
[SPEAKER_10]: You have a development in Malden Center.

283
00:22:47,959 --> 00:22:49,540
[SPEAKER_10]: You have the casino coming in in Everett.

284
00:22:50,201 --> 00:22:52,542
[SPEAKER_10]: You have Assembly Row in Somerville that creates traffic.

285
00:22:52,942 --> 00:23:01,168
[SPEAKER_10]: You have possible development at the Malden Hospital, the old Malden Hospital site up in Malden and North Medford.

286
00:23:02,588 --> 00:23:05,030
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's going to create possibly 400 to 500 car trips a day.

287
00:23:08,633 --> 00:23:18,477
[SPEAKER_10]: I was so concerned about the Malvern hospital issue that, you know, I asked, uh, then, uh, president DelaRusso, if we could set up a, uh, a committee, an ad hoc committee to look at that issue.

288
00:23:18,517 --> 00:23:24,100
[SPEAKER_10]: And myself, counselor Scott Pelley and counselor, uh, uh, Mungo Kern have, uh, have looked at this issue.

289
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:33,984
[SPEAKER_10]: And, uh, during our last meeting, we actually, uh, you know, asked that the method police department conduct a study, a traffic study in that area to look at traffic.

290
00:23:35,245 --> 00:23:36,806
[SPEAKER_10]: They put in a traffic counter for 12 days.

291
00:23:38,538 --> 00:23:46,240
[SPEAKER_10]: 12 days on Murray Hill Road, 33,500 cars in 12 days on Murray Hill Road.

292
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:48,820
[SPEAKER_10]: That tells a story right there.

293
00:23:49,921 --> 00:23:51,181
[SPEAKER_10]: This needs to be looked at.

294
00:23:51,641 --> 00:23:57,002
[SPEAKER_10]: Every single neighborhood is experiencing traffic-related issues.

295
00:23:57,423 --> 00:24:02,944
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you take a look at what's happening up in that section, it's just a microcosm of what's happening all over the city.

296
00:24:04,424 --> 00:24:08,065
[SPEAKER_10]: Traffic is unreal, and it needs to be dealt with, and we need to have someone

297
00:24:09,158 --> 00:24:15,263
[SPEAKER_10]: that has the educational background, that went to school, studied traffic, and knows how to deal with these types of issues.

298
00:24:15,863 --> 00:24:18,305
[SPEAKER_10]: We must act now, our residents deserve better.

299
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:25,690
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a public safety issue, it's a quality of life issue, and we need proactive leadership, and that is why I offer this resolution tonight.

300
00:24:26,391 --> 00:24:34,417
[SPEAKER_10]: I ask Mayor Burke to appropriate the funding for traffic engineer, or have a traffic engineer on retainer included in the fiscal year 2018 budget.

301
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:38,920
[SPEAKER_10]: In addition, I ask my colleagues tonight for the support of this resolution.

302
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:41,311
[SPEAKER_10]: And, uh, I move approval.

303
00:24:41,331 --> 00:24:45,173
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, in addition, I do know that there are some residents that would like to speak on this issue.

304
00:24:45,493 --> 00:24:46,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

305
00:24:46,454 --> 00:24:47,614
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

306
00:24:48,134 --> 00:24:49,035
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor DelaRusso.

307
00:24:49,835 --> 00:24:51,536
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, uh, thank you.

308
00:24:51,636 --> 00:24:57,279
[SPEAKER_05]: And through you to a council Falco, thank you, uh, for offering this, uh, resolution again.

309
00:24:57,299 --> 00:25:04,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, we can also be thankful for Councilor Knight who, uh, has offered similar measures in the past years.

310
00:25:04,843 --> 00:25:08,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, this is a subject that's been discussed by this body over the years.

311
00:25:09,495 --> 00:25:36,963
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's been discussed in the administration over the years in that one of the issues that has been weighed back and forth in discussions that I've been a part of was assessing our ability to pay and hire a person at a salary level, or would we be able to get the same type of service from an individual from having a company on retainer.

312
00:25:37,397 --> 00:25:45,317
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's one of the things I would imagine that has to be weighed by the administration and our able people.

313
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:54,802
[SPEAKER_05]: who work in the offices of budget and finance and our comptroller's office.

314
00:25:57,103 --> 00:25:58,684
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what the answer is.

315
00:26:00,005 --> 00:26:01,126
[SPEAKER_05]: One could be good as another.

316
00:26:01,166 --> 00:26:12,995
[SPEAKER_05]: And when we look at communities nearby who have full-time traffic engineers working for them, one of the qualities that I've noticed undeniably

317
00:26:14,142 --> 00:26:28,711
[SPEAKER_05]: within those communities that have a full-time traffic engineer, that they too, in their proximity to Medford and Boston, share many of the same traffic problems and volume issues that we do now without a traffic engineer.

318
00:26:29,232 --> 00:26:31,153
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not a reason for us not to have one.

319
00:26:32,233 --> 00:26:39,678
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this person can help coordinate as we move forward in the implementation of the Smart Streets programs

320
00:26:40,729 --> 00:27:03,745
[SPEAKER_05]: in this city that we're a proud grantee of, that having a person either working with the engineer's office, either on a full-time basis or as a consultancy firm that has us as one of its accounts and who's invested in Medford's well-being, we'd all benefit.

321
00:27:04,185 --> 00:27:09,849
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I'm grateful and supportive of this measure, and I'd like to second approval, Mr. President.

322
00:27:10,497 --> 00:27:12,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor DelaRusso.

323
00:27:13,418 --> 00:27:14,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

324
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:15,859
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

325
00:27:15,959 --> 00:27:23,663
[SPEAKER_06]: And thank you to Councilor Falco for bringing this measure forward and Councilor DelaRusso for his rather accurate historic breakdown of the situation, Mr. President.

326
00:27:23,823 --> 00:27:36,008
[SPEAKER_06]: I recall this matter coming up at the FY17 budget debates, followed by some community involvement, some community questions as to whether or not this is an expenditure that's worthwhile, and quite a bit of support coming out saying that it was.

327
00:27:36,708 --> 00:27:40,170
[SPEAKER_06]: I, for one, personally feel as though we've gone the way of the consultant too long.

328
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:47,772
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that we need an in-house person that's going to be able to meet our day-to-day demands and our day-to-day needs and someone that will be under our control and direction.

329
00:27:47,792 --> 00:27:49,413
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's very important, Mr. President.

330
00:27:50,053 --> 00:27:53,815
[SPEAKER_06]: However, I think that Councilor Falco and Councilor De La Russa have hit the nail on the head.

331
00:27:54,115 --> 00:27:55,655
[SPEAKER_06]: We're seeing a tremendous amount of congestion.

332
00:27:55,675 --> 00:27:56,976
[SPEAKER_06]: We're seeing a tremendous amount of growth.

333
00:27:57,796 --> 00:28:01,437
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the things that I've had a problem with for a long time is the timing of our lights.

334
00:28:01,777 --> 00:28:09,620
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we have five-state roads that cut through a terminate here in the city of Medford, we have limited control over our ability to change the signaling and the signage and so on and so forth.

335
00:28:10,144 --> 00:28:35,169
[SPEAKER_06]: And it really seems as though we have two separate entities that are working in opposite directions the state in the city doing different things And I think that we need to communicate a little bit better So that we can work on the timing of our lights for example the detour at the Karatek bridge brings three or four thousand car trips an hour up Winthrop Street Rotary And I think this detour was put into place three weeks after the road was closed up after a year and a half for construction with a brand new road put on it

336
00:28:36,122 --> 00:28:40,204
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, if you look at Winthrop Street in front of Memorial Park, Mr. President, you'll see that the street's coming apart.

337
00:28:40,244 --> 00:28:40,845
[SPEAKER_06]: It's falling apart.

338
00:28:41,045 --> 00:28:41,965
[SPEAKER_06]: It needs to be resurfaced.

339
00:28:43,066 --> 00:28:49,549
[SPEAKER_06]: I can claim that that is probably due to the increased volume of traffic that's been detoured and directed down to the city roads.

340
00:28:49,609 --> 00:28:55,773
[SPEAKER_06]: So having these five-state roadways cut through our community and terminating our community is creating an increased burden, Mr. President.

341
00:28:56,053 --> 00:29:00,175
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that we might have also an opportunity to reach out to the individuals at the state level.

342
00:29:00,508 --> 00:29:10,490
[SPEAKER_06]: and ask them for some mitigation and some help in addressing these issues because of the fact that we're closely approximated to the capital city and that we have so many state roadways and state controlled streets in our community.

343
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:29,514
[SPEAKER_06]: We might be able to leverage that for some additional funding, maybe a traffic study to check the signage, to check out lights and the timing thereof to ensure the traffic patents move more smooth, or maybe it's a one-time payment for us to purchase a, one-time payment for us to hire a traffic engineer and then it falls on us to continue the payment thereof.

344
00:29:30,087 --> 00:29:31,748
[SPEAKER_06]: But this is a measure that I wholeheartedly support.

345
00:29:31,808 --> 00:29:33,989
[SPEAKER_06]: I thank my council colleagues for supporting this measure as well.

346
00:29:34,569 --> 00:29:35,970
[SPEAKER_06]: This is what we call, I think, a no-brainer.

347
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:38,031
[SPEAKER_06]: This is something we need in the community, and we all know it.

348
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:39,472
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

349
00:29:39,972 --> 00:29:40,852
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Max.

350
00:29:42,153 --> 00:29:43,133
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

351
00:29:43,353 --> 00:29:49,036
[SPEAKER_16]: And I want to thank Councilor Felkel for his persistency on this measure.

352
00:29:49,116 --> 00:29:53,138
[SPEAKER_16]: He's brought this up several times within the past year.

353
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:59,501
[SPEAKER_16]: And I, as one member of the council, am tired of hearing that

354
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,922
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, the administration is reviewing this.

355
00:30:02,602 --> 00:30:08,247
[SPEAKER_16]: Or the administration is having a problem whether or not to hire a full-time person or a consultant.

356
00:30:09,549 --> 00:30:21,940
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, the administration is good at doing $100,000 studies, so I'm surprised they haven't warranted a $100,000 study to figure out if they need a consultant or a full-time employee, Mr. President.

357
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:26,464
[SPEAKER_16]: All we need to do, Mr. President, it's a very simple request.

358
00:30:26,942 --> 00:30:36,778
[SPEAKER_16]: The chief of police and FY 16 budget requested several positions, one of which was a traffic engineer.

359
00:30:37,439 --> 00:30:41,405
[SPEAKER_16]: And we heard the other night from the chief of police at the community neighborhood meeting.

360
00:30:41,747 --> 00:30:47,111
[SPEAKER_16]: at the Salt Method Fire Station, that that was his request for the FY16 budget.

361
00:30:47,671 --> 00:30:50,273
[SPEAKER_16]: And he said, I am the chair of the traffic commission.

362
00:30:50,733 --> 00:31:04,963
[SPEAKER_16]: I sit with other department heads as well as members of the community on this particular traffic commission, and none of us have the experience, knowledge, or expertise as a traffic engineer.

363
00:31:06,298 --> 00:31:17,311
[SPEAKER_16]: And he said that would be worth its weight in gold to have someone that could be in the community and look at each individual section of the community and come out with recommendations.

364
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:22,538
[SPEAKER_16]: But for years, Mr. President, the administration, past and present,

365
00:31:22,958 --> 00:31:25,038
[SPEAKER_16]: have been dragging their feet, Mr. President.

366
00:31:25,338 --> 00:31:28,979
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm tired of hearing the same excuses over and over again.

367
00:31:29,439 --> 00:31:37,461
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, regarding traffic calming initiatives, three years ago, Mayor McGlynn promised us a pilot program for raised crosswalks.

368
00:31:38,721 --> 00:31:40,381
[SPEAKER_16]: He said there would be three in the community.

369
00:31:40,841 --> 00:31:43,282
[SPEAKER_16]: Three years later, they implemented one.

370
00:31:43,562 --> 00:31:51,083
[SPEAKER_16]: So we have two, one on Harvard Street and one on Central Ave, Mr. President.

371
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:56,011
[SPEAKER_16]: that still have not come to fruition, and that was a promise we received, Mr. President.

372
00:31:56,452 --> 00:32:07,275
[SPEAKER_16]: We also were promised, and I know Walk Method fought hard for this, they asked for pedestrian crossing signs at each intersection, Mr. President.

373
00:32:08,215 --> 00:32:12,617
[SPEAKER_16]: At each crosswalk, they asked for pedestrian neon signs.

374
00:32:13,334 --> 00:32:21,356
[SPEAKER_16]: And that was supposedly approved several years ago, and to date, we have still not received pedestrian crossing signs in this community.

375
00:32:21,816 --> 00:32:28,718
[SPEAKER_16]: So, you know, I think what we need to do, Mr. President, rather than just keep on giving lip service, because we're all in favor of this.

376
00:32:29,218 --> 00:32:34,740
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know one member of the council that's not in favor of this or hasn't spoken in favor of this, Mr. President.

377
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:46,205
[SPEAKER_16]: But when the time comes and the chief puts it in his budget, that's the time to stand up and say, sorry, Madam Mayor, we're not going to support your budget unless we see a traffic engineer.

378
00:32:46,826 --> 00:32:51,608
[SPEAKER_16]: The chief was asking for a crime data analyst in his recommendations.

379
00:32:52,008 --> 00:33:01,833
[SPEAKER_16]: And the reason why, Mr. President, is many residents are concerned on what's going on in this community, and there's very little reporting from the police department regarding crime statistics.

380
00:33:02,133 --> 00:33:13,379
[SPEAKER_16]: So the chief said, you know what, it'd be a great idea to have a civilian come in and be able to log this information, put it on our website, put it on the city website, and be able to disseminate this information throughout the community.

381
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:17,941
[SPEAKER_16]: And that was, again, something that the mayor took out of the budget.

382
00:33:18,241 --> 00:33:20,102
[SPEAKER_16]: The mayor took police cars out of the budget.

383
00:33:20,771 --> 00:33:24,194
[SPEAKER_16]: The police department, pretty soon, Mr. President, will be like Fred Flintstone.

384
00:33:24,394 --> 00:33:29,639
[SPEAKER_16]: They'll be using their feet in the cars, moving the cars around, because the cars are falling apart.

385
00:33:29,859 --> 00:33:32,942
[SPEAKER_16]: They have 150,000, 200,000 miles on them.

386
00:33:33,162 --> 00:33:36,786
[SPEAKER_16]: They're up and ready to 24 hours a day, seven days a week, Mr. President.

387
00:33:37,346 --> 00:33:42,451
[SPEAKER_16]: So these are the things that really, I think this council, we all support these initiatives.

388
00:33:43,252 --> 00:33:46,615
[SPEAKER_16]: But when it comes time to stand tall, I think we have to stand tall.

389
00:33:47,368 --> 00:33:52,313
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, I appreciate Councilor Felco wanting to put into this in the FY18 budget.

390
00:33:52,754 --> 00:33:54,075
[SPEAKER_16]: That's five months from now.

391
00:33:54,716 --> 00:33:56,037
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd rather see it come out now.

392
00:33:56,578 --> 00:33:57,939
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think we can wait any longer.

393
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:01,784
[SPEAKER_16]: We're behind the eight ball in this community on every issue.

394
00:34:02,184 --> 00:34:03,505
[SPEAKER_16]: And public safety is the top.

395
00:34:04,106 --> 00:34:14,594
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, at the Salt Bedford Fire Station, the meeting they had the other night on public safety, residents wanted to know why we're not moving forward on simple initiatives.

396
00:34:15,014 --> 00:34:16,416
[SPEAKER_16]: Why isn't anything happening?

397
00:34:16,836 --> 00:34:19,258
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's tough when you can't give someone an answer.

398
00:34:19,878 --> 00:34:23,121
[SPEAKER_16]: Or you say, well, the administration's taking it under advisement.

399
00:34:23,801 --> 00:34:26,764
[SPEAKER_16]: How many times can you tell someone that same answer?

400
00:34:27,004 --> 00:34:28,445
[SPEAKER_16]: We're taking it under advisement.

401
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:32,076
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, it just doesn't cut the mustard anymore.

402
00:34:32,676 --> 00:34:35,099
[SPEAKER_16]: And I appreciate this effort.

403
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:36,280
[SPEAKER_16]: I will support this effort.

404
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:39,263
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd like to see a vote on it to happen immediately.

405
00:34:40,163 --> 00:34:41,645
[SPEAKER_16]: But if the council sees fit to

406
00:34:42,275 --> 00:34:45,559
[SPEAKER_16]: try to get it in the FY18 budget, then so be it.

407
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:57,030
[SPEAKER_16]: But when the chief of police who sat on the traffic commission for the past 20 years as the chair tells you he needs help, comes out and says he needs help, the man needs help.

408
00:34:57,571 --> 00:35:03,637
[SPEAKER_16]: He's running a department with over 100 police men and women trying to keep this community safe.

409
00:35:03,897 --> 00:35:05,739
[SPEAKER_16]: He's also the chair of the traffic commission.

410
00:35:06,099 --> 00:35:09,921
[SPEAKER_16]: Tonight, we gave him an additional responsibility to hand out licenses for taxis.

411
00:35:10,361 --> 00:35:15,564
[SPEAKER_16]: So that man is overworked right now, and he's understaffed in his office.

412
00:35:16,084 --> 00:35:31,153
[SPEAKER_16]: And I know one of the other offerings was to — I think it was Counsel Longo Kern offered last week to add to the traffic division in the department, the police department, which is sorely lacking personnel.

413
00:35:32,073 --> 00:35:35,755
[SPEAKER_16]: But, Mr. President, we have to stand up at some point as a council.

414
00:35:36,506 --> 00:35:40,309
[SPEAKER_16]: Enough, enough lip service, enough lip service.

415
00:35:40,609 --> 00:35:41,490
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's do something.

416
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:42,831
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's do something.

417
00:35:42,851 --> 00:35:43,471
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President.

418
00:35:43,952 --> 00:35:44,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

419
00:35:44,452 --> 00:35:44,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

420
00:35:44,752 --> 00:35:45,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Council marks.

421
00:35:45,953 --> 00:35:57,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, for those you don't know, I attended the traffic commission hearing meeting today and the motion that we passed last week about reducing the speed to 25 miles per hour was passed by the commission today.

422
00:35:57,762 --> 00:36:01,525
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh, hopefully, uh, that will, uh, do something.

423
00:36:01,545 --> 00:36:04,667
[SPEAKER_04]: But, uh, to counsel marks as we, uh, Max remarks,

424
00:36:05,907 --> 00:36:09,604
[SPEAKER_04]: The chief again reiterated today that he is not a traffic engineer.

425
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:13,771
[SPEAKER_04]: And because I said that was brought up multiple times and one is needed.

426
00:36:15,772 --> 00:36:16,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address with the record.

427
00:36:17,052 --> 00:36:17,372
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

428
00:36:17,412 --> 00:36:18,533
[SPEAKER_07]: Gene Martington coming straight.

429
00:36:18,613 --> 00:36:23,455
[SPEAKER_07]: First, I want to thank Mr. Falco and I want to thank especially the police meetings that we've been held holding.

430
00:36:23,935 --> 00:36:24,715
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's wonderful.

431
00:36:25,135 --> 00:36:34,478
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's great that the police take it on the road because from what I hear from the police chief, it's gotten a much better, um, turnout by going to the different neighborhoods.

432
00:36:34,518 --> 00:36:35,319
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that's great.

433
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:39,500
[SPEAKER_07]: And I want to thank, uh, representative Barbara was there and, um,

434
00:36:40,115 --> 00:36:47,658
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Knight was there, Mr. Marks was there, Mr. Falco and Mr. Carviello were there, and you were at the last one there, Mr. Scarpelli.

435
00:36:47,678 --> 00:36:55,420
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you very much for being there, because it's important for the citizens and the police and, you know, the elected officials.

436
00:36:56,161 --> 00:36:58,562
[SPEAKER_07]: I like politicians, but elected officials, be nice tonight.

437
00:37:00,122 --> 00:37:03,703
[SPEAKER_07]: So this issue is, of course, the mayor knows that this is a big issue.

438
00:37:03,743 --> 00:37:04,864
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not news.

439
00:37:05,424 --> 00:37:08,185
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is a huge tool for the police department to use.

440
00:37:08,877 --> 00:37:17,760
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so big that I'm going to say that it's worth hiring, instead of hiring a police officer or two police officers, if you do it right, it's worth one or two police officers.

441
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:26,263
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know the police aren't going to like that, but it is that big of a tool for the city to have organized traffic flow because it's such a huge issue.

442
00:37:26,724 --> 00:37:28,384
[SPEAKER_07]: But this isn't just a financial issue.

443
00:37:29,445 --> 00:37:29,685
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

444
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:30,805
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a cultural issue.

445
00:37:31,325 --> 00:37:35,827
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's the one part of it that, that people, that it's going to cause an undercurrent.

446
00:37:36,218 --> 00:37:58,326
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if you change the current patterns, like when they had that big snowstorm winter and they changed all those patterns to one-way streets in South Boston, the year that everybody learned how to snowdive in their yards, they realized that the patterns that they used for those emergencies turned out to be what they actually used going forward, because it created an ease in the flow of traffic.

447
00:37:58,866 --> 00:38:05,248
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we create an ease in the flow of traffic, it's going to cause cultural changes in where you can park and everything else.

448
00:38:05,725 --> 00:38:08,588
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's going to be a cultural shift that goes along with this.

449
00:38:08,909 --> 00:38:10,050
[SPEAKER_07]: This isn't just about hiring.

450
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:20,361
[SPEAKER_07]: But I do agree that Mr. Knight, that whoever we hire, this is another point, whoever we hire needs to see the long game and be responsible for whatever happens at least five years out.

451
00:38:20,922 --> 00:38:23,825
[SPEAKER_07]: So even if it's a consult or whatever, consultant,

452
00:38:24,405 --> 00:38:34,371
[SPEAKER_07]: Or if it's permanent, they need to be here and held accountable for whatever happens at least five years out so that we can hold them accountable to say, you did this to us.

453
00:38:34,571 --> 00:38:38,013
[SPEAKER_07]: Now we have a nest and everybody's going into the same direction.

454
00:38:38,293 --> 00:38:43,496
[SPEAKER_07]: The other thing is that I think this is a common ground issue as well as a cultural issue.

455
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:48,202
[SPEAKER_07]: common ground in that I think all of the arteries should be fully examined.

456
00:38:48,802 --> 00:38:52,744
[SPEAKER_07]: All of what we call emergency arteries should be fully examined.

457
00:38:53,304 --> 00:38:59,727
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we need to extend the sidewalks out a little bit, because the precursor to Mr. Falco is actually Mr. Marks.

458
00:39:00,387 --> 00:39:03,649
[SPEAKER_07]: He's been talking about traffic calming for three or four years now.

459
00:39:04,569 --> 00:39:06,250
[SPEAKER_07]: And traffic calming is a huge issue too.

460
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:11,172
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we need to widen the sidewalks, this is actually a benefit to

461
00:39:13,051 --> 00:39:22,440
[SPEAKER_07]: everyone in the city, all the people that like to walk by, um, not bikes, but, uh, wheelchairs and, um, strollers and pets.

462
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:32,209
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to walk your dog down the street, if at least if we can do all of the emergency arteries and have them and, and, and I'm going to be nice, I'm really in a good mood.

463
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:35,692
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you want to put in those little tiny trees, you know,

464
00:39:36,122 --> 00:39:37,763
[SPEAKER_07]: the little ones that don't have roots to them.

465
00:39:38,423 --> 00:39:43,465
[SPEAKER_07]: As long as you have, the priority needs to be walkers, wheelchairs, and strollers.

466
00:39:43,625 --> 00:39:47,847
[SPEAKER_07]: And then if there's enough room, you can even put in those little tiny trees that everybody likes.

467
00:39:48,307 --> 00:39:52,189
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that'll bring about, if you walk, this is the positive part of the culture.

468
00:39:52,649 --> 00:39:55,010
[SPEAKER_07]: If you widen the sidewalks, you talk to the neighbors.

469
00:39:55,870 --> 00:40:02,633
[SPEAKER_07]: If people are outside in their neighborhoods, walking around on the sidewalks that are nice and clear, then people will get to know each other.

470
00:40:04,087 --> 00:40:09,570
[SPEAKER_07]: And that is a positive, at least on the main arteries, anything we call an emergency artery in the winter.

471
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:11,071
[SPEAKER_07]: So those are my suggestions.

472
00:40:11,351 --> 00:40:11,871
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

473
00:40:12,492 --> 00:40:12,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Ms.

474
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:13,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Martin.

475
00:40:16,227 --> 00:40:17,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address for the record, please.

476
00:40:17,327 --> 00:40:18,948
[SPEAKER_11]: Jean Nuzzo, 35 Parris Street.

477
00:40:19,988 --> 00:40:24,110
[SPEAKER_11]: I am, as a resident, in support of having someone to review our traffic patterns.

478
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:35,373
[SPEAKER_11]: I think they're critical, especially considering the level of development that's on the table and what it looks like will be coming our way in the near future with some more large-scale developments that I'm hearing of.

479
00:40:36,313 --> 00:40:44,196
[SPEAKER_11]: The one thing I'd ask you to consider when you ponder how much we have to look at right now, the type of a backlog we have,

480
00:40:44,976 --> 00:40:53,863
[SPEAKER_11]: the prevalency of the areas that need to be reviewed in the city, the depth of expertise you'll need to get through them, and at some level, the benefit of autonomy.

481
00:40:54,824 --> 00:41:07,453
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it may be worthwhile to, in this resolution, include, for the short term, a consultancy because they can provide expertise that an individual person might not be able to do over the long term.

482
00:41:08,053 --> 00:41:19,081
[SPEAKER_11]: as well as several people to get through that first pass more quickly, that could come out of discretionary funding, and then next year you could have an individual takeover and kind of keep the ball rolling.

483
00:41:19,662 --> 00:41:25,706
[SPEAKER_11]: It just seems like a daunting task for one person, and there'll be even more of the apple to bite come next year.

484
00:41:25,906 --> 00:41:26,887
[SPEAKER_11]: So that was just my thought.

485
00:41:27,468 --> 00:41:27,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

486
00:41:27,828 --> 00:41:31,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address of the record, please.

487
00:41:32,725 --> 00:41:34,466
[SPEAKER_08]: Jones here, 40 Cedar Road North.

488
00:41:34,966 --> 00:41:44,832
[SPEAKER_08]: First as a point of information, during that traffic study on Murray Hill Road, that was during the Thanksgiving holiday, so it would have been more if we had normal traffic during that time period.

489
00:41:45,993 --> 00:41:49,775
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted to voice my strong support for a traffic engineer in the city of Medford.

490
00:41:50,315 --> 00:41:57,499
[SPEAKER_08]: I live in Fulton Heights and as many of you know, I've been working with our Malden neighbors to bring development to the Malden Hospital site that would benefit both communities.

491
00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:02,701
[SPEAKER_08]: Any development and the construction for it will bring changes to our traffic in Fulton Heights.

492
00:42:03,381 --> 00:42:10,965
[SPEAKER_08]: As Councillor Lungo-Kern has stated, we need to be at the decision table with our own traffic assessment and recommendations with respect to any development.

493
00:42:11,945 --> 00:42:21,813
[SPEAKER_08]: Fulton Heights has already had traffic issues, as Councilor Falco pointed out, with our northern and eastern neighbors using our neighborhood as a cutthroat to avoid Route 60 to get to Route 93.

494
00:42:22,653 --> 00:42:38,586
[SPEAKER_08]: And with these traffic concerns and other concerns in Medford, I did attend one of the rotating traffic commission meetings that Councilor Falco arranged with the police chief and was optimistic that the conversations would result in some meaningful changes in our city that are long overdue for increasing safety in our neighborhoods.

495
00:42:39,381 --> 00:42:46,602
[SPEAKER_08]: The chief did listen intently to the traffic issues that all citizens from around the city made, from speeding issues to congestion to parking.

496
00:42:47,302 --> 00:42:55,708
[SPEAKER_08]: And the community members made suggestions for relief, from speed bumps to changing the roads to do not enter during certain time periods, or to make them residents only.

497
00:42:56,669 --> 00:43:05,655
[SPEAKER_08]: While the chief appreciated the solution suggestion, he raised concerns about them, saying that a traffic engineer was needed to figure out the right long-term solution.

498
00:43:06,076 --> 00:43:09,098
[SPEAKER_08]: He didn't want to just move the problem from one place to another.

499
00:43:10,179 --> 00:43:16,243
[SPEAKER_08]: There was one person, it might have been Cheryl, I'm not sure, who said that there was an issue regarding a sidewalk.

500
00:43:16,796 --> 00:43:24,083
[SPEAKER_08]: and that a decision had previously been made based on the recommendations of a traffic engineer, so he was reluctant to make another change.

501
00:43:24,944 --> 00:43:37,696
[SPEAKER_08]: What I took away from the conversation is that the chief really feels strongly and rightfully so that we shouldn't make any major changes or implement any solutions that would just move problems from one place to another until we get a traffic engineer in Medford.

502
00:43:38,854 --> 00:43:42,937
[SPEAKER_08]: Getting a traffic engineer seems to be the trigger point in beginning to solve many of these issues.

503
00:43:43,638 --> 00:43:52,505
[SPEAKER_08]: And with many of the impending developments on the horizon, both in our city and our neighborhoods surrounding areas like the casino in Everett,

504
00:43:52,841 --> 00:43:59,727
[SPEAKER_08]: We do need to work strategically with our neighboring communities and have our own traffic assessments and recommendations with respect to all development.

505
00:44:00,267 --> 00:44:06,333
[SPEAKER_08]: I strongly support and respect respectfully request that the city council support council Falco's resolution.

506
00:44:07,273 --> 00:44:07,574
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

507
00:44:07,834 --> 00:44:08,174
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

508
00:44:11,497 --> 00:44:12,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address of the record, please.

509
00:44:12,905 --> 00:44:15,027
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street.

510
00:44:15,728 --> 00:44:19,411
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wanted to come up with, everyone has mentioned development.

511
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:21,253
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course, I'm gonna mention development as well.

512
00:44:21,733 --> 00:44:26,378
[SPEAKER_13]: But the thing is that all the new developers that come into the city commission the traffic study.

513
00:44:27,097 --> 00:44:32,642
[SPEAKER_13]: For their area, all the traffic studies come out the same, nobody has cars, and there's going to be no increase in traffic.

514
00:44:33,303 --> 00:44:44,634
[SPEAKER_13]: But what they don't tell us is that as a city, we are allowed to turn to that developer and ask them to pay for a traffic study, our own independent traffic study, to determine if that is actually true.

515
00:44:45,034 --> 00:44:47,337
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's something that we should definitely be exercising.

516
00:44:48,858 --> 00:44:53,163
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe Malden was planning to ask the Malden Hospital to pay for a traffic study for them.

517
00:44:53,243 --> 00:45:01,733
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that in the meeting that you all had, the ad hoc committee meeting, you did say that that was a possibility of asking Malden Hospital to pay.

518
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:03,536
[SPEAKER_13]: for traffic study for us.

519
00:45:04,417 --> 00:45:13,084
[SPEAKER_13]: And MPAC right now is doing their grant and they're suggesting changing three of the streets in the square possibly to being two-way streets.

520
00:45:13,605 --> 00:45:15,967
[SPEAKER_13]: So I imagine they must have gotten a traffic study.

521
00:45:16,287 --> 00:45:22,973
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's a lot of things going on that perhaps we need to get involved in because the piecemeal approach isn't working.

522
00:45:23,033 --> 00:45:26,736
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd hate to see Salem Street, Riverside, Clippership all of a sudden be two-way streets.

523
00:45:27,338 --> 00:45:29,299
[SPEAKER_13]: because they think that's going to be better for the square.

524
00:45:29,679 --> 00:45:33,000
[SPEAKER_13]: And then it trickles out into all the other areas and makes everything else worse.

525
00:45:33,601 --> 00:45:38,863
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's just the big thing is that if things are going on, we should attach ourselves to them.

526
00:45:38,923 --> 00:45:47,606
[SPEAKER_13]: If there is money available from developers, maybe we should be, if we're not immediately doing that study, should be asking for it to be put into a fund for the study.

527
00:45:48,687 --> 00:45:50,047
[SPEAKER_13]: That will happen at some point.

528
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:51,648
[SPEAKER_13]: So just going forward.

529
00:45:52,048 --> 00:45:52,288
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

530
00:45:56,808 --> 00:45:57,649
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address of the record.

531
00:45:58,989 --> 00:46:01,191
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, Andrew cast and Eddie Cushion street method.

532
00:46:01,231 --> 00:46:01,591
[SPEAKER_01]: Mass.

533
00:46:02,271 --> 00:46:05,793
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, first of all, congratulations belatedly to council president.

534
00:46:05,813 --> 00:46:06,614
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Caviello.

535
00:46:06,874 --> 00:46:08,815
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

536
00:46:09,296 --> 00:46:11,077
[SPEAKER_01]: And vice president counselor marks.

537
00:46:11,137 --> 00:46:18,841
[SPEAKER_01]: Congratulations on this subject of our traffic and parking in the name of public safety.

538
00:46:21,583 --> 00:46:22,063
[SPEAKER_01]: Bear with me.

539
00:46:22,103 --> 00:46:25,045
[SPEAKER_01]: A few things came to my head and didn't have a chance to write them down.

540
00:46:25,857 --> 00:46:40,387
[SPEAKER_01]: But I believe Karen DiLorenzo Pop, the community developer, I believe, for the city, I questioned her about Route 16 and 93 way back, and she said, what's the point of time?

541
00:46:40,427 --> 00:46:45,210
[SPEAKER_01]: There was funds for that, but for whatever reason, it's not done.

542
00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:54,196
[SPEAKER_01]: Meaning, coming down 93 South, heading into Method Square's exit 32, which is like 32 ounces at a quart, that's why I remember it.

543
00:46:56,251 --> 00:47:14,246
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you get that at exit, it says, I presume rule 16 cause I don't pay attention cause I know the neighborhoods, but I believe it's probably rule 16 exit west to go to the dentist office in Arlington or wherever, but they have to go through method square and they're not buying a cup of coffee.

544
00:47:14,266 --> 00:47:17,909
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of congestion for that reason.

545
00:47:18,409 --> 00:47:23,474
[SPEAKER_01]: So if indeed the state had earmarked that money's to have when they built with 93 1960,

546
00:47:25,733 --> 00:47:38,057
[SPEAKER_01]: they should have came behind you city hall after the method square exit and then go around the senior citizen and go to 16 West directly.

547
00:47:39,137 --> 00:47:40,237
[SPEAKER_01]: That's only my opinion.

548
00:47:43,578 --> 00:47:46,659
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, also I was at the sub method police meeting.

549
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:47,840
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

550
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:50,421
[SPEAKER_01]: Counselor Falco for bringing the show on the road.

551
00:47:51,041 --> 00:47:54,902
[SPEAKER_01]: The fourth thought of four on the compass rose and

552
00:47:56,198 --> 00:48:05,081
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of laid into Chief Sacco a little bit about what I call, for lack of better words, a goat's F of a situation on Mystic Avenue.

553
00:48:05,141 --> 00:48:19,725
[SPEAKER_01]: There's three cars parked right after Atlas as you're coming in towards the square, and it never should have been parked there ever, in my opinion, because five lanes becomes only one lane going south after you pass Atlas.

554
00:48:20,366 --> 00:48:24,747
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of a sudden, from zero cars parked on both sides, I presume it's a state road,

555
00:48:26,905 --> 00:48:38,110
[SPEAKER_01]: There's three cars parked across from 141 Mystic Ave, which is David's Auto Repair and Ravello's Tin Knockin', whatever it was.

556
00:48:38,610 --> 00:48:49,154
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I wanted to presume when you gave them the license, whenever that was, either one of those, I'm sure you counselors questioned them about parking vehicles on the street, et cetera.

557
00:48:49,674 --> 00:48:51,855
[SPEAKER_01]: I would think common sense, but I don't recollect for sure.

558
00:48:53,796 --> 00:48:56,637
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyways, that's a real GOAT situation.

559
00:48:57,235 --> 00:49:03,717
[SPEAKER_01]: And I noticed, I didn't go out Thursday after the Wednesday meeting, but I went out Friday and I noticed those three vehicles were not there.

560
00:49:04,277 --> 00:49:14,740
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have an index card, I've been listing them for over a month, and two of the vehicles have been there over five times on different days.

561
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:16,861
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just during business hours.

562
00:49:18,521 --> 00:49:21,302
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, I'm tired of seeing a lot of accidents there.

563
00:49:21,562 --> 00:49:24,383
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm tired of seeing cars being rolled over in accidents.

564
00:49:24,803 --> 00:49:26,584
[SPEAKER_01]: Tired of seeing injuries at that point.

565
00:49:27,933 --> 00:49:31,414
[SPEAKER_01]: and hopefully there'll be less accidents for sure.

566
00:49:33,534 --> 00:49:40,376
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I may, I want to come in chief circle and his offices again, counselor Falco.

567
00:49:41,296 --> 00:49:41,716
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

568
00:49:43,997 --> 00:49:52,739
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm here to speak about one thing originally and that is we're talking about traffic safety.

569
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:55,640
[SPEAKER_01]: Method Square is not really a square.

570
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:57,060
[SPEAKER_01]: We get a lot of situations.

571
00:49:57,513 --> 00:50:01,055
[SPEAKER_01]: As Councilor Knight, I believe, mentioned, we have three, four, five state roads.

572
00:50:03,516 --> 00:50:14,542
[SPEAKER_01]: However, when developers come into this city, I'm worried about parking because if there's parking, then there's less of a road to drive upon also.

573
00:50:16,163 --> 00:50:25,647
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't understand, for example, at the end of this month, according to the legal notices and the method transcript, on January 31st, I believe,

574
00:50:27,473 --> 00:50:38,876
[SPEAKER_01]: Board of Appeals is having two businesses or two landowners, I should say, LLCs, whatever they are, that are adjoining each other.

575
00:50:39,856 --> 00:50:44,817
[SPEAKER_01]: And they want to build condominiums or apartments, I believe, or condominiums.

576
00:50:45,437 --> 00:50:55,780
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not against development, especially smart development, even though it doesn't help the real estate taxpayers because you don't

577
00:50:56,100 --> 00:51:00,803
[SPEAKER_01]: deduct that first from prop two and a half increases and it works against us.

578
00:51:01,663 --> 00:51:09,248
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, it's called the, uh, the annuity that keeps on giving as a Russian lady used to say, but I won't get into that right now.

579
00:51:10,489 --> 00:51:19,654
[SPEAKER_01]: However, according to this various requests amongst height restrictions and this and that, I highlighted off street park.

580
00:51:19,714 --> 00:51:25,838
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that implies to me that this developer or development

581
00:51:26,377 --> 00:51:33,004
[SPEAKER_01]: is looking to circumvent the 2.1 parking spaces per apartment or per condominium.

582
00:51:33,464 --> 00:51:37,008
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that's the requirement, ordinance, whatever you want to call it.

583
00:51:38,209 --> 00:51:45,276
[SPEAKER_01]: That should not ever be negotiable in my opinion, unless it was, I shouldn't say never, never, Mr. Bond, but

584
00:51:48,030 --> 00:51:57,456
[SPEAKER_01]: If anything, you should increase Mr. Knight, the 2.1 spots to 3.1 but never half it to one and a quarter spots.

585
00:51:58,637 --> 00:52:01,599
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just thinking out loud, not out of the box.

586
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:03,920
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to be right focused in the box.

587
00:52:06,702 --> 00:52:09,003
[SPEAKER_01]: A word to the wise for the board of appeals.

588
00:52:09,083 --> 00:52:09,423
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

589
00:52:09,624 --> 00:52:12,425
[SPEAKER_04]: You should attend that meeting and make your opinion known.

590
00:52:13,906 --> 00:52:14,307
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

591
00:52:14,847 --> 00:52:16,468
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion by Councilor Falco,

592
00:52:18,183 --> 00:52:19,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Second by Councilor Knight.

593

[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

594
00:52:20,825 --> 00:52:21,285
[SPEAKER_04]: All opposed?

595
00:52:21,785 --> 00:52:25,408
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

598
00:52:40,198 --> 00:52:42,640

00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:43,780
[SPEAKER_04]: Daniel Craven.

600
00:52:49,013 --> 00:53:01,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Ryan McEvoy, Robert Noyes, Rogan O'Hara, Michael Richard, Kevin Shea, and Sean Spencer, and Christopher Wells.

601
00:53:01,379 --> 00:53:01,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Counselor Knight.

602
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:04,960
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

603
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:11,323
[SPEAKER_06]: These individuals just recently were sworn in as firefighters, completed their requirements at the academy, and are now undergoing field training.

604
00:53:11,984 --> 00:53:18,267
[SPEAKER_06]: The majority of these individuals started work the week of Christmas, and we have some new firefighters in our ranks, Mr. President.

605
00:53:18,287 --> 00:53:24,149
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'd like to welcome them aboard, thank them for their service, and wish them a healthy, safe, and happy career.

606
00:53:24,529 --> 00:53:25,149
[SPEAKER_04]: And well needed.

607
00:53:25,470 --> 00:53:26,310
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

610
00:53:30,492 --> 00:53:30,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

611
00:53:31,752 --> 00:53:32,873
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

612
00:53:32,893 --> 00:53:34,153
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-7-0-2-0, offered by Councilor Knight.

614
00:53:42,356 --> 00:54:04,593
[SPEAKER_04]: to the 2017 USA collegiate hockey team and be it further resolved that the Memphis city council wish Brianna, excuse me, Brittany and her teammates best of luck as they compete in the 2017 winter world university games in elementary Cassatt, Cassandra's in between January 28th and February 8th.

615
00:54:04,633 --> 00:54:05,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

616
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:07,152
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

617
00:54:07,172 --> 00:54:07,873
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll help you with that.

618
00:54:08,133 --> 00:54:11,558
[SPEAKER_06]: Almaty, Kazakhstan is where they'll be playing, Mr. President.

619
00:54:12,219 --> 00:54:17,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Brittany played for the Medford Mustangs hockey team, the girls' hockey team, and she had a very successful career.

620
00:54:18,427 --> 00:54:22,412
[SPEAKER_06]: She is now a student at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, where she is continuing

621
00:54:22,818 --> 00:54:24,559
[SPEAKER_06]: her studies, and her hockey playing.

622
00:54:24,799 --> 00:54:33,564
[SPEAKER_06]: And recently, she was selected to participate in the 2017 USA Collegiate Hockey Team and their World Championships, Mr. President.

623
00:54:33,624 --> 00:54:35,965
[SPEAKER_06]: So many of us know Brittany's father, Kenny.

624
00:54:36,345 --> 00:54:39,527
[SPEAKER_06]: Kenny Lanzilli is one of our building inspectors down in the building department.

625
00:54:40,067 --> 00:54:50,013
[SPEAKER_06]: And Brittany's been before this council a couple of other occasions when she received back-to-back, all scholastic Boston Globe, Boston Herald Awards for her play on the ice, Mr. President.

626
00:54:50,710 --> 00:55:00,480
[SPEAKER_06]: With that being said, it's great to see Brittany represent Medford in the United States of America in the former Soviet Union, and we wish her the best of luck and her teammates, and hopefully they bring home the gold for the U.S.

627
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:02,643
[SPEAKER_06]: of A. Thank you, Counselor Knight.

628
00:55:03,023 --> 00:55:04,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Good person, good family.

629
00:55:04,705 --> 00:55:05,446
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

630
00:55:06,427 --> 00:55:06,527
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

631
00:55:07,327 --> 00:55:08,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

632
00:55:08,889 --> 00:55:11,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Petitions, presentations, and similar matters.

633
00:55:12,256 --> 00:55:23,687
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-7-0-1-9 petition by Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street, Medford, Mass., for the Zoning Board of Appeals to be read prior to the Zoning Board meeting.

634
00:55:24,407 --> 00:55:25,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address for the record, please.

635
00:55:26,169 --> 00:55:28,291
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street.

636
00:55:29,232 --> 00:55:36,318
[SPEAKER_13]: I submitted this petition because I find that finding information about what's going on at the Zoning Board of Appeals prior to the meeting is

637
00:55:37,328 --> 00:55:38,208
[SPEAKER_13]: Fairly difficult.

638
00:55:38,729 --> 00:55:42,310
[SPEAKER_13]: I originally found out about the local street project by accident.

639
00:55:42,570 --> 00:55:47,232
[SPEAKER_13]: I happened to see an email that someone had sent saying that there was a hearing amongst.

640
00:55:47,332 --> 00:55:55,655
[SPEAKER_13]: It was a 490 residential unit building as well as, you know, someone trying to add onto their driveway.

641
00:55:56,076 --> 00:55:57,316
[SPEAKER_13]: So it was just thrown in there.

642
00:55:57,456 --> 00:56:04,439
[SPEAKER_13]: I've been back and forth through city hall and trying to find different ways to find out what the agenda, when the agenda will be posted.

643
00:56:05,245 --> 00:56:07,887
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a way I can get it emailed to me?

644
00:56:08,307 --> 00:56:16,213
[SPEAKER_13]: Is, is there any way that people can really find out other than I heard it's in the paper, but that's not really working out for everyone.

645
00:56:16,273 --> 00:56:26,381
[SPEAKER_13]: But so I think that the best thing to do is since the city council controls the zoning, it would be great if we do not control the zone while you control the zoning ordinances.

646
00:56:27,370 --> 00:56:34,633
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be great if you could draw our attention to the ZBA hearings before they're happening, because a lot of people don't know.

647
00:56:34,733 --> 00:56:37,574
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're chasing these things after they're happening.

648
00:56:37,614 --> 00:56:50,199
[SPEAKER_13]: We currently have four lawsuits for one development, because we're chasing it after it happened, as opposed to having, if we had had 200 or 300 people show up at that hearing, maybe we wouldn't be doing this.

649
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,761
[SPEAKER_13]: I just think that if we want more people to get involved,

650
00:56:54,511 --> 00:56:57,473
[SPEAKER_13]: to make it easier for them to know what's actually happening.

651
00:56:57,873 --> 00:57:02,955
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of people do watch this meeting, people, and people want to know what's happening.

652
00:57:03,656 --> 00:57:15,342
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think we also need to focus on the fact that variances are supposed to be rare, and they're supposed to be good and sufficient cause, according to the Massachusetts Chapter 40, Section 10 laws.

653
00:57:16,629 --> 00:57:26,014
[SPEAKER_13]: So, we really need to work on making sure that we're not victimizing the public, as it says in the law, and conflicting with our local laws and ordinances when we're granting these.

654
00:57:27,194 --> 00:57:31,576
[SPEAKER_13]: So, the next meeting that's coming up is January 25th.

655
00:57:31,696 --> 00:57:32,257
[SPEAKER_13]: It's at 630.

656
00:57:32,397 --> 00:57:34,798
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a community development meeting.

657
00:57:34,858 --> 00:57:37,419
[SPEAKER_13]: It's on the project on Salem Street at the Break Pro.

658
00:57:37,459 --> 00:57:42,521
[SPEAKER_13]: They've also bought the abutters property to increase their chances of having this passed.

659
00:57:42,942 --> 00:57:44,442
[SPEAKER_13]: They've also not shoveled their snow.

660
00:57:44,522 --> 00:57:45,583
[SPEAKER_13]: So, they're very good neighbors.

661
00:57:46,402 --> 00:57:49,723
[SPEAKER_13]: The following Tuesday will be the ZBA meeting on this project.

662
00:57:49,763 --> 00:58:04,566
[SPEAKER_13]: I encourage anyone who's concerned about a project so close to the Roberts elementary school, which is, um, past capacity that this four level building could possibly eclipse their sunlight earlier than it currently is now at one o'clock.

663
00:58:04,626 --> 00:58:10,448
[SPEAKER_13]: The school building obstructs the sunlight in the playground and makes it shaded and colder for the children.

664
00:58:11,068 --> 00:58:11,248
[SPEAKER_13]: So,

665
00:58:11,998 --> 00:58:23,722
[SPEAKER_13]: We need to try to make these people follow our zoning laws, and I hope the City Council will take the lead on keeping distances from buildings, on keeping height, because it's in the best interest of the community.

666
00:58:23,762 --> 00:58:26,442
[SPEAKER_13]: We're talking about traffic studies, additional cars.

667
00:58:26,843 --> 00:58:28,723
[SPEAKER_13]: We're talking about parking issues.

668
00:58:29,083 --> 00:58:36,526
[SPEAKER_13]: The streets in that area are permanent only because of traffic issues, car parking that is not available.

669
00:58:36,906 --> 00:58:41,007
[SPEAKER_13]: So all these things are things that we can do to help ease these transitions.

670
00:58:41,788 --> 00:58:47,470
[SPEAKER_13]: uh, butters know about these things ahead of time, not just the butters, but people that live in the neighborhood that will be affected by these projects.

671
00:58:47,970 --> 00:58:48,971
[SPEAKER_13]: Then we can get ahead of it.

672
00:58:49,011 --> 00:58:51,412
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll get a more active community.

673
00:58:51,832 --> 00:58:58,934
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll get that open, transparent government that everyone campaigned on last year and we can all try to make Medford a better place to live.

674
00:58:59,855 --> 00:59:00,235
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

675
00:59:01,115 --> 00:59:01,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

676
00:59:01,475 --> 00:59:02,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Miss Rodriguez.

677
00:59:02,716 --> 00:59:04,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to receive a place on file.

678
00:59:04,176 --> 00:59:05,957
[SPEAKER_04]: All in favor.

679
00:59:07,618 --> 00:59:07,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

680
00:59:09,298 --> 00:59:10,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's take hands in the,

681
00:59:12,289 --> 00:59:12,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

682
00:59:12,669 --> 00:59:24,971
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, that's when I be resolved that the department of public works report back to the city council in regards to the multiple water main breaks.

683
00:59:26,192 --> 00:59:27,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Counselor Scott Pelley.

684
00:59:30,512 --> 00:59:31,473
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

685
00:59:31,593 --> 00:59:35,193
[SPEAKER_15]: I know that, uh, today you got another call about another water main break.

686
00:59:35,233 --> 00:59:39,574
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's, uh, it's important that, uh, we, we, it seems like it's a pretty,

687
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:42,042
[SPEAKER_15]: scary trend as we move forward.

688
00:59:42,062 --> 00:59:49,052
[SPEAKER_15]: I know that the infrastructure is something that we all fear what's going on and how old our

689
00:59:49,741 --> 00:59:50,361
[SPEAKER_15]: pipes are.

690
00:59:50,882 --> 00:59:59,067
[SPEAKER_15]: So I want to just make sure that, uh, we're prepared as it moves forward to think that this is the, just the beginning of the winter and what's yet to come.

691
00:59:59,428 --> 01:00:04,311
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, making sure that we're, um, prepared moving forward.

692
01:00:04,371 --> 01:00:13,497
[SPEAKER_15]: So if we can have a report from, uh, DPW, maybe the city engineer to help us out to give us some guidelines of what, what, what's been happening, give us an understanding why.

693
01:00:13,577 --> 01:00:15,038
[SPEAKER_15]: So I appreciate it.

694
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:17,940
[SPEAKER_04]: And if, if, if our people have noticed what has been said,

695
01:00:18,243 --> 01:00:20,024
[SPEAKER_04]: several water breaks over the last couple of weeks.

696
01:00:20,545 --> 01:00:21,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

697
01:00:23,427 --> 01:00:23,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Move approval.

698
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:24,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Move approval.

699
01:00:25,108 --> 01:00:25,728
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

700
01:00:26,409 --> 01:00:26,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

701
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:26,909
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

702
01:00:28,610 --> 01:00:29,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

703
01:00:30,211 --> 01:00:31,812
[SPEAKER_04]: Offered by Councilor Scarpelli.

704
01:00:32,533 --> 01:00:46,122
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it resolved that the Department of Transportation, the Director of Human Diversity, City Engineer, meet with the Subcommittee on Transportation to discuss the bus stop at High Street and Main Street in the interest of public safety.

705
01:00:46,582 --> 01:00:47,563
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Scarpelli.

706
01:00:49,602 --> 01:00:50,762
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, Mr. President, thank you.

707
01:00:51,302 --> 01:01:14,687
[SPEAKER_15]: This is something that, as the chairperson of the Transportation Subcommittee, this is very frustrating for the fact that we're reaching out and trying to do our due diligence with Department of Transportation in getting some clarifications on what we've offered a temporary closing of that stop.

708
01:01:17,385 --> 01:01:34,153
[SPEAKER_15]: until the work is done on that side, um, of, of main street and high street for the fact that, um, what's happening is with the construction, the buses are now stopping in the middle of main and high street and people are walking off the curb onto the street and onto the buses.

709
01:01:34,814 --> 01:01:40,977
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, the answer that we received back that if we put a halt to that, uh, that stop for a long period of time,

710
01:01:41,453 --> 01:01:48,097
[SPEAKER_15]: that we would, um, we would lose, uh, the ADA accessibility grandfather clause that was in place.

711
01:01:48,157 --> 01:01:59,863
[SPEAKER_15]: So, uh, I want to make sure that we're all sitting at the table, uh, because as I talked to, um, Diane McLeod and our engineer, there's no such thing as a grandfather clause of what they've told us.

712
01:02:00,485 --> 01:02:02,107
[SPEAKER_15]: We need to move forward, sit at the table.

713
01:02:02,767 --> 01:02:13,518
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll ask my fellow subcommittee members that we meet possibly next Tuesday before our regular meeting and bring everybody to the table and come to a conclusion with this.

714
01:02:16,581 --> 01:02:19,044
[SPEAKER_15]: And again, it's going to happen when

715
01:02:19,553 --> 01:02:21,935
[SPEAKER_15]: uh, somebody gets hurt and that's what I fear the most right now.

716
01:02:22,035 --> 01:02:25,899
[SPEAKER_15]: And, um, so are you, do you want to have a meeting with this group next week?

717
01:02:26,259 --> 01:02:29,943
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm hoping, I'm hoping if we could just at the end of the meeting, I'll talk to the members.

718
01:02:30,183 --> 01:02:32,045
[SPEAKER_15]: I know if you could, I've been doing that.

719
01:02:32,065 --> 01:02:32,425
[SPEAKER_04]: I've tried.

720
01:02:32,445 --> 01:02:32,785
[SPEAKER_04]: So call me.

721
01:02:32,845 --> 01:02:33,025
[SPEAKER_04]: I will.

722
01:02:33,086 --> 01:02:33,626
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'll actually,

723
01:02:40,820 --> 01:02:59,452
[SPEAKER_15]: If we can ask where it is, is at reach out to our state delegation to assist us in making sure that someone's at that meeting, because that's one of the issues we're having is getting someone on the other end of that phone and making sure, um, the person that's coming to the table is the person that's going to answer those questions, not to go back and then revert back to us.

724
01:02:59,492 --> 01:03:01,833
[SPEAKER_15]: So again, thank you for your quick response.

725
01:03:02,053 --> 01:03:02,854
[SPEAKER_15]: And, um, thank you.

726
01:03:03,414 --> 01:03:03,674
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks.

727
01:03:04,735 --> 01:03:05,636
[SPEAKER_09]: Name and address of the record, please.

728
01:03:05,836 --> 01:03:09,438
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, Robert Pinto, zero summit road method, mass from a member of the sport.

729
01:03:09,754 --> 01:03:18,776
[SPEAKER_09]: The part that I think should be established before this board, you folks are the only ones that can actually change a bus stop for whatever it might be.

730
01:03:19,856 --> 01:03:26,278
[SPEAKER_09]: For the MBTA to turn around and change the bus stop arbitrarily for whatever their reasons allegedly are, I don't think you can do it.

731
01:03:26,318 --> 01:03:30,919
[SPEAKER_09]: I think one of the problems you're going to have is the fact that they're going to tell you they don't come out to nighttime meetings.

732
01:03:31,439 --> 01:03:33,019
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not getting paid to do that anymore.

733
01:03:33,479 --> 01:03:37,160
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, you're talking about a public safety issue, but you're also talking about an issue

734
01:03:37,510 --> 01:03:42,011
[SPEAKER_09]: where you have a bridge here in Medford Square, and they're allegedly only halfway through a year and a half into the problem.

735
01:03:42,371 --> 01:03:44,431
[SPEAKER_09]: For the last three weeks, they've had nobody working there.

736
01:03:44,711 --> 01:03:53,553
[SPEAKER_09]: And by having nobody working there, they've completely or could have helped out a couple of the businesses on that right-hand side of the street, but instead they just left the place a total mess.

737
01:03:54,233 --> 01:04:03,175
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's just a shame to think that the state can grant out these contracts to these contractors that'll probably be running two or three jobs at the same time.

738
01:04:03,805 --> 01:04:10,009
[SPEAKER_09]: to the demise of the Medford taxpayer and the Medford taxpaying business person here in the city of Medford.

739
01:04:10,389 --> 01:04:19,234
[SPEAKER_09]: My suggestion would be that not only you get your state delegation and your state senator, I mean, they're the ones that control the purse strings for the Department of Transportation and for the MBTA.

740
01:04:19,873 --> 01:04:23,656
[SPEAKER_09]: And there is no reason for something like this to happen without you folks being notified.

741
01:04:24,376 --> 01:04:35,525
[SPEAKER_09]: And by doing that, hopefully, by bringing, I would suggest that you have a meeting right here before the Memphis City Council and have it discussed in the open unless anyone who has a concern about it, they should be here.

742
01:04:36,626 --> 01:04:40,709
[SPEAKER_09]: And the people that really should be behind all of this is the Chamber of Commerce.

743
01:04:41,009 --> 01:04:42,991
[SPEAKER_09]: It's their business that's being affected.

744
01:04:43,691 --> 01:04:45,733
[SPEAKER_09]: And if their business is getting affected, it's also,

745
01:04:46,535 --> 01:04:50,038
[SPEAKER_09]: the people who patronize those businesses in the area of public safety.

746
01:04:50,679 --> 01:04:55,983
[SPEAKER_09]: So for the MBTA to make their decision without consulting with you, I think they have it in the opposite way.

747
01:04:56,043 --> 01:04:57,685
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think, I think it's upon you.

748
01:04:58,005 --> 01:04:59,206
[SPEAKER_09]: It's your responsibility.

749
01:04:59,426 --> 01:05:00,647
[SPEAKER_09]: Like it was mine when I was there.

750
01:05:00,988 --> 01:05:02,829
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys are vested with the fact you're right.

751
01:05:02,869 --> 01:05:03,930
[SPEAKER_09]: Nothing is grandfathered in.

752
01:05:04,411 --> 01:05:06,132
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you should just need to take the bull by the horns.

753
01:05:06,352 --> 01:05:13,779
[SPEAKER_09]: And if in fact, if in fact they don't want to come at a nighttime meeting, I would suggest that you send a certified letter to Charlie Baker, the governor of this Commonwealth and just tell him,

754
01:05:14,086 --> 01:05:18,867
[SPEAKER_09]: that you're not doing the right thing by your department heads by saying that they refuse to come to a nighttime meeting.

755
01:05:19,407 --> 01:05:20,148
[SPEAKER_09]: This is not right.

756
01:05:20,188 --> 01:05:20,808
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not fair.

757
01:05:21,148 --> 01:05:24,829
[SPEAKER_09]: And it doesn't make sense for public safety and for the bus stop locations.

758
01:05:25,589 --> 01:05:25,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

759
01:05:26,990 --> 01:05:27,550
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so nice.

760
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:28,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Move approval.

761
01:05:28,030 --> 01:05:32,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President.

762
01:05:33,511 --> 01:05:34,452
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

763
01:05:34,932 --> 01:05:42,414
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, as counselor Scott Pelly mentioned, it doesn't make sense to now have a bus stop that people used to get onto the bus from the sidewalk.

764
01:05:42,907 --> 01:05:44,608
[SPEAKER_16]: now have to get onto the bus from the street.

765
01:05:45,048 --> 01:05:49,790
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm not sure how that improves public safety, Mr. President.

766
01:05:49,830 --> 01:06:01,094
[SPEAKER_16]: But, you know, people aren't aware, this community loses over, I think it's $3 or $4 million off our cherry sheet every year that goes back to the MBTA.

767
01:06:01,555 --> 01:06:12,619
[SPEAKER_16]: And when the MBTA refuses to sit down with the board, whatever it is, the council or any other board in this city, it's a slap in the face to every taxpayer in this community, Mr. President.

768
01:06:13,006 --> 01:06:19,271
[SPEAKER_16]: And we pay such a high assessment because of our public transportation and our proximity to Boston.

769
01:06:19,751 --> 01:06:26,316
[SPEAKER_16]: So, as you know, it's not just Method people that are using Wellington Station, the commuter rail, all the bus lines.

770
01:06:26,676 --> 01:06:28,918
[SPEAKER_16]: It's all the surrounding communities that come into our city.

771
01:06:29,278 --> 01:06:35,443
[SPEAKER_16]: And we, as residents, pay a hefty, hefty assessment to the MBTA for this usage.

772
01:06:36,083 --> 01:06:38,205
[SPEAKER_16]: And for them not to come to meetings, Mr. President,

773
01:06:38,470 --> 01:06:39,650
[SPEAKER_16]: is an outright disgrace.

774
01:06:40,091 --> 01:06:44,892
[SPEAKER_16]: And if they can't come out when the streetlights are on to attend a meeting, that's even a bigger disgrace.

775
01:06:45,853 --> 01:06:47,373
[SPEAKER_16]: So I agree.

776
01:06:47,653 --> 01:07:00,038
[SPEAKER_16]: I think we have to have, whether it's before this council or a subcommittee, that's fine with me, but we have to have a meeting to address this issue, Mr. President, because it's unacceptable what's going on at the corner of Main and High Street

777
01:07:00,388 --> 01:07:10,711
[SPEAKER_16]: It's unacceptable that buses are stopping, blocking traffic at peak traffic times and having residents get onto a bus in the middle of the street and exiting a bus on the middle of the street.

778
01:07:11,011 --> 01:07:12,612
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a very dangerous situation.

779
01:07:12,932 --> 01:07:15,873
[SPEAKER_16]: The owners of those properties don't like it either.

780
01:07:16,213 --> 01:07:19,074
[SPEAKER_16]: And we asked the MBTA to move the stop temporarily.

781
01:07:19,534 --> 01:07:21,955
[SPEAKER_16]: until the bridge construction is done.

782
01:07:22,335 --> 01:07:33,277
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think that's quite a hardship for the MBTA, and I think it's something that we could accommodate residents that do get on that stop at a different location very close, Mr. President.

783
01:07:33,537 --> 01:07:34,857
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm not concerned about that.

784
01:07:35,217 --> 01:07:38,098
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm more concerned about the lack of attention from the MBTA.

785
01:07:38,558 --> 01:07:39,978
[SPEAKER_16]: So I agree with Councilor Scott Pelley.

786
01:07:39,999 --> 01:07:42,199
[SPEAKER_16]: The quicker we can set this meeting up, the better off.

787
01:07:42,856 --> 01:07:43,817
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

788
01:07:43,897 --> 01:07:44,437
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight.

789
01:07:45,078 --> 01:07:52,023
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Mark said something that really sparked my interest, and he said that we're giving back three to $4 million a year annually to the MBTA as part of our assessment.

790
01:07:52,644 --> 01:08:00,430
[SPEAKER_06]: And right now, we just had an hour-long discussion about traffic in the city of Medford and a need for us to have good, reliable public transportation.

791
01:08:01,170 --> 01:08:07,075
[SPEAKER_06]: And when we're sitting here battling a traffic problem, the MBTA is actually cutting service and raising fares.

792
01:08:07,315 --> 01:08:08,596
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think you're absolutely right.

793
01:08:08,616 --> 01:08:12,479
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that we do need to bring them to the table, and I support Councilor Scott Pelly's resolution.

794
01:08:12,995 --> 01:08:21,221
[SPEAKER_06]: But I just found it very interesting when you put that into perspective like that, how much money we're actually paying for our MBTA assessments and the lack of control and the lack of respect that they provide us as a city.

795
01:08:22,322 --> 01:08:24,103
[SPEAKER_06]: It's something that's very concerning, Mr. President.

796
01:08:24,323 --> 01:08:27,905
[SPEAKER_06]: And at the same time, they're making moves towards raising fares and cutting service.

797
01:08:28,486 --> 01:08:32,649
[SPEAKER_06]: Our commuter rail service right now has been changed and we're not seeing the same levels of service that we saw before.

798
01:08:32,989 --> 01:08:34,570
[SPEAKER_06]: We're looking at the 326 and the 325 bus lines.

799
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:37,132
[SPEAKER_06]: They're looking at privatizing those entirely.

800
01:08:37,492 --> 01:08:40,014
[SPEAKER_06]: They were looking at privatizing those lines entirely, Mr. President.

801
01:08:40,598 --> 01:08:50,523
[SPEAKER_06]: When we're in a position right now where there's a demand and a need for improved services and we're seeing a lack of service and a cutback on the amount of service that's provided to us, I think it is very concerning.

802
01:08:50,543 --> 01:08:52,705
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think Councilor Marks is bringing that up because that was a very good point.

803
01:08:52,965 --> 01:08:53,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you Councilor Knight.

[SPEAKER_06]: Michael Callahan was a mentor to me for a number of years.

831

834
01:11:24,732 --> 01:11:26,253

838
01:11:39,048 --> 01:11:46,072
[SPEAKER_06]: As we sit here in the community and we talk about development here in Medford, there's an urban legend here in our community that goes back a number of years.

839
01:11:46,632 --> 01:11:52,795
[SPEAKER_06]: And Councillor Callaghan, if you go up to Wrights Pond, you'll see a memorial there in his honour.

840
01:11:53,256 --> 01:12:01,000
[SPEAKER_06]: And the urban legend has it that developers were coming in and they were going to try to purchase the land surrounding Wrights Pond and turn that into condominium housing.

841
01:12:01,420 --> 01:12:05,242
[SPEAKER_06]: And through Councillor Callaghan's efforts prior to his election as a governor's councillor, I may add,

842
01:12:05,655 --> 01:12:09,438
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, they were able to beat back the development and secure the land for parkland for years to come.

843
01:12:09,458 --> 01:12:09,959
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President.

844
01:12:09,999 --> 01:12:13,902
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, it's with great sadness tonight that I mocked the anniversary of my dear friend.

845
01:12:13,922 --> 01:12:18,986
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, however, uh, it's with great memories that I think back and, uh, recall the good times that I have with him.

846
01:12:19,046 --> 01:12:21,148
[SPEAKER_06]: And I asked that my council colleagues support this resolution.
