1
00:00:11,034 --> 00:00:13,058
Welcome everyone to Mr. MHS 2017.

2
00:01:07,939 --> 00:01:15,842
I'm gonna listen to the... I'm gonna listen to the... I'm gonna listen to the... F to the E, R to the G to the I to the E, A to the T to the I to the E, put it down right here.

3
00:01:15,862 --> 00:01:17,983
I'm gonna listen to the... I'm gonna listen to the...

4
00:01:37,136 --> 00:01:37,597
You, you, you.

5
00:02:27,184 --> 00:02:28,505
Alright guys, I'm gonna pray tonight.

6
00:02:28,545 --> 00:02:31,066
Let's give one more round for the audience before we leave.

7
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:38,991
Alright, I'm just gonna take out my competition now.

8
00:02:40,431 --> 00:02:42,773
The only competition I have, David Pagliaro.

9
00:02:56,392 --> 00:02:58,973
Here we go, ready?

10
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:02,914
And... Again!

11
00:03:03,254 --> 00:03:06,716
He's out, Sammy wins!

12
00:03:15,427 --> 00:03:17,188
Oh, he has him up.

13
00:03:17,288 --> 00:03:18,729
Looks like it's too easy.

14
00:03:18,889 --> 00:03:20,430
Oh, he has him up again.

15
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,090
Oh, helpful.

16
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:22,331
This is it.

17
00:03:22,351 --> 00:03:24,612
This is where they bounce.

18
00:04:02,344 --> 00:04:04,305
The winner of Mr. M.H.S.

19
00:04:04,325 --> 00:04:06,186
2017 is... DEVIN BOMBARDO!

20
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,723
How does it feel to win Mr. NHS?

21
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:40,528
I'm, whoa.

22
00:04:40,568 --> 00:04:40,868
Whoa.

23
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:45,856
I did not expect, I honestly, I was expecting Matabella.

24
00:04:46,076 --> 00:04:48,179
But, thank you.

25
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:48,961
Thank you everyone.

26
00:04:53,153 --> 00:04:53,854
Good afternoon.

27
00:04:53,874 --> 00:04:58,279
Medford is proud to support Team HEMO at Gillette Stadium on Sunday, June 4th.

28
00:04:58,819 --> 00:05:03,945
Our community has come together to raise awareness and join in the fight against pediatric cancer.

29
00:05:04,505 --> 00:05:06,407
I'm buzzing my hair for kids with cancer.

30
00:05:06,888 --> 00:05:10,011
Medford is buzzing off for HEMO.

31
00:05:10,251 --> 00:05:14,836
About five years ago, I started hearing commercials on the radio about this great cause.

32
00:05:16,301 --> 00:05:28,364
I think three, four years ago, I had a student who was personally affected, losing a younger sibling, Hemo, and kind of motivated me to do it that year.

33
00:05:28,524 --> 00:05:31,985
I decided to buzz in Hemo's honor.

34
00:05:32,325 --> 00:05:34,326
I am donating to Team Hemo.

35
00:05:34,826 --> 00:05:37,226
Medford is buzzing for Hemo.

36
00:05:37,806 --> 00:05:40,187
At Medford, we shave our hair for Hemo.

37
00:05:40,227 --> 00:05:43,408
Medford is buzzing for Hemo.

38
00:05:44,183 --> 00:05:48,107
We are so proud of our McGlynn students who are buzzing off of HEMO.

39
00:05:48,447 --> 00:05:53,572
And special thanks to Mr. Petrellis and Mr. Kuzmitz who organizes this event every year.

40
00:05:53,592 --> 00:05:54,773
Way to go, McGlynn!

41
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:56,754
I donated to Team HEMO.

42
00:05:56,995 --> 00:05:58,756
Medford is buzzing for HEMO.

43
00:05:59,217 --> 00:06:01,559
Medford is buzzing off for HEMO.

44
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:03,801
Medford is buzzing for HEMO.

45
00:06:04,161 --> 00:06:05,642
And I'm donating for HEMO.

46
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,624
Medford is buzzing for HEMO.

47
00:06:07,804 --> 00:06:10,207
Medford is buzzing for HEMO!

48
00:06:10,947 --> 00:06:12,629
Medford is buzzing for HEMO.

49
00:06:12,689 --> 00:06:15,331
Medford is buzzing for HEMO.

50
00:06:16,132 --> 00:06:18,134
Medford is buzzing off for HEMO.

51
00:06:18,414 --> 00:06:20,776
Medford is buzzing off for HEMO.

52
00:06:21,136 --> 00:06:23,599
I'm buzzing my head for kids with cancer.

53
00:06:23,859 --> 00:06:24,700
I'm Anthony Petralos.

54
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,444
I'm a fifth grade teacher at the McGlynn Elementary School and I'm the team captain of team HEMO this year.

55
00:06:29,884 --> 00:06:35,748
This is our fourth year in the One Mission Buzz Off, which is held at Gillette Stadium, June 4th this year.

56
00:06:35,868 --> 00:06:42,172
Four years ago, a third-grade student in our school, Hemal Dufourage, passed away of a real form of spinal cancer.

57
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:44,354
We do it for their family every single year.

58
00:06:44,394 --> 00:06:48,717
We get t-shirts, we organize, we get about 15, 20 different people to join the team.

59
00:06:48,737 --> 00:06:56,102
Why do we need such luxurious things to prove our worth in this world?

60
00:06:56,712 --> 00:07:03,595
We force ourselves to make sure our phones are our newest models, our clothes are just off the runway, and our homes are of most extreme size and value.

61
00:07:04,195 --> 00:07:07,236
We constantly feel the need to compare ourselves to people around us.

62
00:07:07,936 --> 00:07:11,718
We are obsessed with the latest of trends, such as what did Kim Kardashian wear to the party?

63
00:07:12,422 --> 00:07:13,543
Why must I know what she wore?

64
00:07:13,823 --> 00:07:15,343
Why must I buy the same things she wore?

65
00:07:15,723 --> 00:07:17,004
What's so different about me and Kim?

66
00:07:17,724 --> 00:07:19,945
Is it because she can wear a dress of ridiculous value?

67
00:07:20,386 --> 00:07:22,126
Or because she buys the most expensive things?

68
00:07:22,847 --> 00:07:27,249
Last time I checked, me and Kim both need air to breathe, food to survive, and a home for safety.

69
00:07:27,709 --> 00:07:31,511
But because I do not own the same overpriced dress Kim wore, I am ignored.

70
00:07:32,191 --> 00:07:38,434
The scenario may seem normal, but when you switch the roles to a middle class man and a homeless man, the situation is turned immediately.

71
00:07:39,344 --> 00:07:45,730
Suddenly the lower class person is ignored, but being put down in negative terms, which is lazy, drug addict, slob, trash, and worse.

72
00:07:46,331 --> 00:07:55,781
We judge without thinking, before thinking that that person is the same as you and I. They breathe air to live like you, they need food to survive like you, and they need a home for safety like you.

73
00:07:56,461 --> 00:08:01,867
But because they are homeless, you choose to place them in a negative way without thinking about them as a person like yourself.

74
00:08:02,932 --> 00:08:08,914
them as a person in the sense of where they came from, who raised them, what are their goals in life, do they have children, do they have a spouse.

75
00:08:09,694 --> 00:08:14,615
Most don't ask themselves questions like these when they see a homeless man, because they don't see him as a real person.

76
00:08:15,476 --> 00:08:20,777
For example, when a new neighbor moves in, you don't assume they are lazy or a drug addict, you assume they are just like yourself.

77
00:08:21,377 --> 00:08:27,199
Yet when you see a man asleep in an alleyway in Boston, you suddenly place negative terms on him such as criminal slob and trash.

78
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:29,900
Why must us as humans think like this?

79
00:08:30,361 --> 00:08:32,762
That person is just like you, whether you like it or not.

80
00:08:33,463 --> 00:08:34,383
You must accept this.

81
00:08:34,904 --> 00:08:37,365
Once you accept this, you can start seeing them as normal people.

82
00:08:37,685 --> 00:08:41,668
People who are mothers, fathers, sons, daughters, uncles, aunts, and even grandparents.

83
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:51,395
These people are exactly like you, just in a difficult situation which is often brought on due to poor economy, lack of affordable housing, lack of education, and medical expenses.

84
00:08:52,355 --> 00:08:53,136
You can help them.

85
00:08:54,036 --> 00:08:57,679
You can donate almost anything from food to clothes to furniture to money.

86
00:08:57,999 --> 00:08:58,699
Anything will help.

87
00:08:59,179 --> 00:09:04,343
You can offer jobs to these people or you can volunteer your time at a kitchen which provides a meal for those in need of one.

88
00:09:05,243 --> 00:09:08,765
There are so many endless ways to help people who need to be guided back to their feet.

89
00:09:09,986 --> 00:09:11,907
This person we speak of one day could be you.

90
00:09:12,508 --> 00:09:16,630
You never know when you'll be thrown in the situation that 564,700 other Americans have found themselves in.

91
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:24,752
In a recent study, most people had been homeless for more than half a year and had been homeless several times.

92
00:09:25,513 --> 00:09:29,774
The study showed most of these people's highlights of their week was being helped in some simple way.

93
00:09:30,355 --> 00:09:40,479
These simple ways include a man being offered a job washing dishes at a diner, a pregnant woman getting donated baby clothes and bottles, and a man waking up in the doorway to a sandwich and bag of chips.

94
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,281
The simple things you do can change somebody's life.

95
00:09:43,441 --> 00:09:46,022
It's taking a few dollars or minutes out of your week that hung.

96
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:55,451
Now that we've put this all in perspective, do you really need that dress in Kardashian War when there are people around you that can't even afford to eat one meal a day?

97
00:09:55,471 --> 00:10:03,016
Do you really need all those luxurious items that will only be put to use when there's a man you cannot even have a warm place to sleep on the coldest of winter nights?

98
00:10:03,677 --> 00:10:04,017
You don't.

99
00:10:04,377 --> 00:10:04,977
You know you don't.

100
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:05,738
I know I don't.

101
00:10:05,858 --> 00:10:08,760
Everybody knows they don't, yet they keep following in these terrible habits.

102
00:10:09,913 --> 00:10:10,875
Make a change in the world.

103
00:10:11,155 --> 00:10:14,261
Do it for the people who currently struggle, for those who used to struggle.

104
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:19,229
Do it for yourself, your friends, your family, and most importantly, the future generations.

105
00:10:19,931 --> 00:10:22,074
You can make a change, so go out and do it.

106
00:11:27,195 --> 00:11:30,804
Climbing up the top sails, I lost my mind
