62
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:29,049
[SPEAKER_13]: This evening, the applicant Biolife Plasma Services is seeking a site plan special permit from this board.

63
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:46,775
[SPEAKER_13]: By way of introduction, the applicant Biolife Plasma Services is a company dedicated to developing plasma-based therapies that contribute to the creation of innovative treatments for medical conditions such as hemophilia, immunodeficiencies, and other genetic disorders.

64
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:56,385
[SPEAKER_13]: BioLife facilities, such as the one being proposed, collect plasma donations from healthy adult donors by a process similar to that of blood donations.

65
00:05:56,865 --> 00:06:02,088
[SPEAKER_13]: The collected plasma is then processed and utilized in the development of advanced medical treatments.

66
00:06:02,748 --> 00:06:09,352
[SPEAKER_13]: The proposed site, as mentioned, is located within the C1 district where medical office uses is allowed as of right.

67
00:06:09,973 --> 00:06:16,216
[SPEAKER_13]: While the use is permitted within the district and there's no intent to alter the existing footprint of the structure itself,

68
00:06:16,862 --> 00:06:31,149
[SPEAKER_13]: Section 94-3327 of the Medford Zoning Ordinance defines a major project to include medical offices containing 5,000 square feet or more of gross floor area, thereby requiring and necessitating a special permit by this board.

69
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:39,733
[SPEAKER_13]: By way of background, the subject site is situated within the Fellsway Plaza Shopping Center, located on Route 28 in Medford.

70
00:06:40,994 --> 00:06:42,855
[SPEAKER_13]: The shopping center is comprised of three

71
00:06:43,514 --> 00:06:53,123
[SPEAKER_13]: separate parcels of land, each owned by separate entities, john if you could share your screen and and put up the site plan, so we can show the board.

72
00:06:53,803 --> 00:06:55,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm just, I hope I have permission.

73
00:06:55,345 --> 00:06:58,768
[SPEAKER_09]: Looks like you do.

74
00:07:11,301 --> 00:07:13,623
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not giving me an option to select a screen.

75
00:07:13,964 --> 00:07:17,087
[SPEAKER_02]: It lets me toggle between one participant or multiple.

76
00:07:25,536 --> 00:07:27,858
[SPEAKER_13]: I can share my screen if John's not able to.

77
00:07:33,455 --> 00:07:42,540
[SPEAKER_22]: John, you should, if you click just the share screen as opposed to like the little up caret arrow next to it, I think you should be able to share.

78
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,420
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

79
00:07:51,645 --> 00:07:55,627
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

80
00:07:55,667 --> 00:07:56,708
[SPEAKER_13]: So as you can see,

81
00:07:57,701 --> 00:08:04,073
[SPEAKER_13]: The parcel is situated in the center of what is essentially the Fells Way Plaza shopping center.

82
00:08:05,015 --> 00:08:07,199
[SPEAKER_13]: The subject site is has a land area of 666,700

83
00:08:09,908 --> 00:08:11,389
[SPEAKER_13]: and 34 square feet.

84
00:08:12,309 --> 00:08:15,832
[SPEAKER_13]: There are three separate buildings located on the subject property.

85
00:08:16,432 --> 00:08:21,535
[SPEAKER_13]: The first being down here, which is a Century Bank area.

86
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:25,977
[SPEAKER_13]: It has a gross flurry of approximately 3,075 square feet.

87
00:08:26,778 --> 00:08:30,060
[SPEAKER_13]: The next parcel is that building is that occupied

88
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:46,091
[SPEAKER_13]: by the stop and shop supermarket that has a gross flurry of approximately 63,386 square feet, and the subject building which is immediately adjacent to the stop and shop building, which has approximately 84,952 square feet.

89
00:08:49,213 --> 00:09:12,368
[SPEAKER_13]: The portion of the building to be occupied by BioLife, which is in Maroon and is at the opposite end of the lot, adjacent to the New Creek LLC property, they actually share a party wall, is approximately 20,300 square feet and was, as indicated, formerly occupied by Models, a retail sporting goods shop.

90
00:09:13,348 --> 00:09:15,510
[SPEAKER_13]: Models closed their doors in

91
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:16,730
[SPEAKER_13]: August of 2020.

92
00:09:16,911 --> 00:09:25,997
[SPEAKER_13]: And of significance to the space adjacent to that property, which is approximately 4,400 square feet, is also vacant.

93
00:09:26,137 --> 00:09:29,419
[SPEAKER_13]: That closed its doors back in October of 2019.

94
00:09:29,499 --> 00:09:43,209
[SPEAKER_13]: The project before the board is primarily involving repurposing and refitting the interior area of this 20,300 square foot space.

95
00:09:43,789 --> 00:09:45,731
[SPEAKER_13]: There are minor cosmetic changes

96
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,571
[SPEAKER_13]: to the facade of the building.

97
00:09:47,651 --> 00:09:50,153
[SPEAKER_13]: John, can you go to that page, I believe?

98
00:09:54,557 --> 00:10:02,743
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is the Models building down below, which shows you what it looked like at that, when it was, was existing, essentially.

99
00:10:03,364 --> 00:10:14,873
[SPEAKER_13]: What is proposed to do is to change, obviously, the signage to BioLife Plasma Services, to include a couple of additional windows on the front

100
00:10:15,452 --> 00:10:23,939
[SPEAKER_13]: the facade and to the side, and those are essentially the changes that are being made to the exterior of the front of the building.

101
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,481
[SPEAKER_13]: In addition to those changes.

102
00:10:27,222 --> 00:10:33,407
[SPEAKER_13]: There are some changes being made to the loading dock area, and if you can go.

103
00:10:35,148 --> 00:10:42,429
[SPEAKER_13]: which includes the addition of an exterior raised platform and a dumpster pad located at the rear.

104
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:49,271
[SPEAKER_13]: As indicated by the city engineer, this doesn't involve any regrading or surface work.

105
00:10:50,271 --> 00:10:55,012
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's just an improvement that doesn't involve any digging of any real sort.

106
00:10:55,892 --> 00:11:02,753
[SPEAKER_13]: Lastly, the other improvement which is being made relates to the signage located nearest the Riverside Ave entrance

107
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:14,398
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, that is just removing the signage, which relates to models, and including the, the bio life sign.

108
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,082
[SPEAKER_13]: As the project is very limited in scope.

109
00:11:19,002 --> 00:11:23,927
[SPEAKER_13]: We have requested a number of waivers as to the site plan requirement.

110
00:11:24,227 --> 00:11:29,011
[SPEAKER_13]: And I believe that you should have those in your package, the city engineering department

111
00:11:29,432 --> 00:11:31,734
[SPEAKER_13]: has taken no exception to the requested waivers.

112
00:11:32,195 --> 00:11:38,541
[SPEAKER_13]: And I can run through the waivers now or at the close of the presentation based on the preference of the board.

113
00:11:38,581 --> 00:11:46,148
[SPEAKER_13]: It may be best to wait until all of the presenters have shown you what's involved.

114
00:11:49,331 --> 00:11:50,873
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, let's wait till the end of the presentation.

115
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:56,372
[SPEAKER_13]: With that, I will turn the presentation over to Dwayne Messer of Suit to Build.

116
00:11:57,032 --> 00:12:07,636
[SPEAKER_13]: He will provide you some more details as to the operation of the company and also specifics as to what types of improvements they're making in the floor plan and also the dumpster area.

117
00:12:08,456 --> 00:12:08,776
[SPEAKER_13]: Dwayne.

118
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,480
[SPEAKER_13]: I did see him.

119
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:38,580
[SPEAKER_09]: to also note while we're doing this that our land use planner who has been staffing the board for the last couple of years, Annie Streetman has departed and we have a new planner helping us out today from the Office of Community Development, Amanda Centrella.

120
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:45,384
[SPEAKER_09]: So Amanda, thank you very much for all your help in preparing the materials and staffing us tonight.

121
00:12:46,245 --> 00:12:48,366
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, excited to be working with you all.

122
00:12:50,072 --> 00:12:52,994
[SPEAKER_13]: I did see Dwayne, has he having trouble with his microphone?

123
00:12:53,935 --> 00:12:54,895
[SPEAKER_08]: Kathleen, can you hear me now?

124
00:12:55,496 --> 00:12:56,696
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, yep, yes.

125
00:12:56,716 --> 00:12:57,357
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, thank you.

126
00:12:57,377 --> 00:12:58,237
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep, sorry about that.

127
00:12:58,257 --> 00:13:00,038
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, this is Dwayne Musser with Build to Suit.

128
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:06,342
[SPEAKER_08]: John, if you could pull up the floor plan, I could run through the interior real quick.

129
00:13:06,402 --> 00:13:08,324
[SPEAKER_08]: If anybody has any questions, please let me know.

130
00:13:08,364 --> 00:13:15,128
[SPEAKER_08]: So as Kathleen stated, we're taking over the vacant space, approximately 20,300 square feet.

131
00:13:15,568 --> 00:13:18,510
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a 60 bed facility for BioLife.

132
00:13:19,887 --> 00:13:21,509
[SPEAKER_08]: 60 possible donors at one time.

133
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,952
[SPEAKER_08]: And the operation is by appointment only.

134
00:13:25,112 --> 00:13:31,017
[SPEAKER_08]: So all patients, all clients make appointments and show up at their allotted time.

135
00:13:31,997 --> 00:13:39,404
[SPEAKER_08]: The process starts with each client going through a health screening process before they make any donations.

136
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:42,646
[SPEAKER_08]: That process at the first appointment lasts a couple hours.

137
00:13:42,706 --> 00:13:48,251
[SPEAKER_08]: And after they pass all the health screening, then they can come back and make their donation.

138
00:13:49,272 --> 00:13:57,737
[SPEAKER_08]: that they go through another smaller health screening before each donation and the health screening, that donation can last 45 to maybe 60 minutes.

139
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:07,982
[SPEAKER_08]: But basically you have the front entryway at the front of the front of the building, similar to where Modell's was, that is for patients only.

140
00:14:09,242 --> 00:14:17,827
[SPEAKER_08]: And all the operations are up front, the exam rooms, the waiting area are in the front, restrooms for the clients.

141
00:14:18,547 --> 00:14:22,530
[SPEAKER_08]: There's some office area off to the side for staff and managers.

142
00:14:23,151 --> 00:14:28,134
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the large area you can see kind of on the bottom of the floor pan is the 60 beds.

143
00:14:29,495 --> 00:14:33,459
[SPEAKER_08]: In the back of house is the plasma processing.

144
00:14:34,219 --> 00:14:39,904
[SPEAKER_08]: There is a large freezer box kind of in the middle of that back house where the plasma is stored.

145
00:14:40,724 --> 00:14:47,009
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the rear of the building is the receiving area for dried goods that are used.

146
00:14:48,928 --> 00:14:50,389
[SPEAKER_08]: during the operation.

147
00:14:50,449 --> 00:15:00,273
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd also like to point out there is a biohazard room off to the side that is a secured room that's accessed by staff only.

148
00:15:00,473 --> 00:15:05,655
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the biohazard is removed by a national company that handles that material.

149
00:15:07,716 --> 00:15:17,800
[SPEAKER_08]: As far as the exterior additions that Kathleen mentioned, we'd be upgrading the facade as far as signage and painting at the back of the house.

150
00:15:18,563 --> 00:15:25,348
[SPEAKER_08]: be removing the existing loading dock, expanding it a little bit, and then adding a secured block dumpster.

151
00:15:27,829 --> 00:15:32,252
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there's a ramp, obviously, to get material up and out of the building.

152
00:15:34,114 --> 00:15:37,476
[SPEAKER_08]: And like Kathleen stated, the exterior work is very minimal.

153
00:15:37,496 --> 00:15:45,521
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be cutting and removing some existing asphalt to put in new footings and foundations for the ramp and dumpster, and then repaving around that.

154
00:15:45,581 --> 00:15:47,743
[SPEAKER_08]: So very minimal impacts to the exterior.

155
00:15:48,813 --> 00:15:55,658
[SPEAKER_08]: Kathleen also covered the signage on the front of the building and an addition of a panel on one of the existing pylons.

156
00:15:57,499 --> 00:15:59,581
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd be happy to answer any questions that you may have.

157
00:16:03,624 --> 00:16:07,407
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you just explain the reefer trailer location that's there on the diagram?

158
00:16:07,427 --> 00:16:08,127
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, absolutely.

159
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:08,888
[SPEAKER_08]: I should upset.

160
00:16:08,948 --> 00:16:09,308
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

161
00:16:09,348 --> 00:16:13,852
[SPEAKER_08]: So the reefer trailer is just in case of emergency.

162
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:16,513
[SPEAKER_08]: The reefer trailer is not there permanently.

163
00:16:17,114 --> 00:16:18,555
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, it only shows up

164
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:30,765
[SPEAKER_08]: In case of a power outage for an extended period of time, the plasma has to be stored at a very specific temperature so it can be processed later for medical purposes.

165
00:16:30,845 --> 00:16:46,971
[SPEAKER_08]: So in case of an extended power outage or in the case of a freezer malfunction, BioLife has a national provider on call for all their centers all over the US to bring in an emergency reefer trailer that the plasma

166
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:52,603
[SPEAKER_08]: would be stored in until the existing freezer can be repaired or the power comes back on.

167
00:16:53,344 --> 00:17:07,573
[SPEAKER_08]: We put it on all our applications and site plans, so everybody's aware that, you know, in case of a natural disaster and there's no power for an extended period of time, we do need to bring that reefer trailer in and save all that product, so.

168
00:17:08,673 --> 00:17:12,456
[SPEAKER_09]: So it was some kind of refrigerated or freezer trailer is what that is.

169
00:17:12,496 --> 00:17:14,918
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, yes, it's basically a semi with a freezer

170
00:17:17,715 --> 00:17:21,638
[SPEAKER_08]: component on it, you know, they go up and down the highway all the time.

171
00:17:21,658 --> 00:17:30,704
[SPEAKER_08]: You just don't notice them from another semi, but basically as the semi trailer would be on their part and the material would be stored in that.

172
00:17:30,724 --> 00:17:32,825
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

173
00:17:33,006 --> 00:17:33,226
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks.

174
00:17:33,266 --> 00:17:33,466
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

175
00:17:33,486 --> 00:17:39,170
[SPEAKER_09]: Members of the public watching might have some other, like might have some confusion if they're seeing a reefer trailer.

176
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:39,310
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

177
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:40,010
[SPEAKER_08]: Understood.

178
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:40,291
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

179
00:17:40,471 --> 00:17:41,932
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's a very common question.

180
00:17:41,972 --> 00:17:42,132
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

181
00:17:46,396 --> 00:17:46,816
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

182
00:17:47,436 --> 00:17:54,838
[SPEAKER_09]: Are there other proponents we're gonna present or questions about what has been presented by members of the board?

183
00:17:55,699 --> 00:18:04,461
[SPEAKER_13]: We also have Patrick Dunford from BHB who will present on his traffic study that he performed in conjunction with the project.

184
00:18:04,921 --> 00:18:06,682
[SPEAKER_13]: And I believe I saw Patrick here as well.

185
00:18:17,003 --> 00:18:17,764
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I see him on there.

186
00:18:17,884 --> 00:18:18,745
[SPEAKER_09]: Amanda, do you see him?

187
00:18:20,746 --> 00:18:21,166
[SPEAKER_12]: There we go.

188
00:18:21,447 --> 00:18:21,987
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry about that.

189
00:18:22,027 --> 00:18:23,629
[SPEAKER_12]: I couldn't get unmuted, needed permission.

190
00:18:24,329 --> 00:18:28,873
[SPEAKER_12]: So with that out of the way, I'm Pat Dunford, Transportation Engineer with VH- Sorry about that.

191
00:18:29,493 --> 00:18:30,134
[SPEAKER_12]: No, not a problem.

192
00:18:30,374 --> 00:18:38,361
[SPEAKER_12]: So we had prepared a traffic evaluation for this project, May 24th.

193
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:42,244
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know the city engineering and planning staff had reviewed that.

194
00:18:43,086 --> 00:18:52,130
[SPEAKER_12]: Without going into too much detail, the reoccupancy of the space has a pretty negligible change in the overall trip generation for the plaza.

195
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:56,912
[SPEAKER_12]: So with that, there's not a lot of corresponding impact as you'd expect.

196
00:18:57,672 --> 00:19:04,235
[SPEAKER_12]: However, with any project, there's always an understanding that there is some degree of an impact from any new use coming in.

197
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:18,222
[SPEAKER_12]: So what the city staff had done was identify some kind of low cost improvements that could benefit existing deficiencies in this area that this project could possibly implement.

198
00:19:18,942 --> 00:19:21,703
[SPEAKER_12]: They had summarized that in a July 7th memorandum.

199
00:19:21,763 --> 00:19:27,405
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not sure if that's gone to the board, but I had a chance to talk with city staff about this and

200
00:19:28,297 --> 00:19:43,408
[SPEAKER_12]: They drew those improvements, the potential suggested improvements, out of a roadway safety audit, which is a road, it's a planning and safety evaluation of Route 28 at Riverside Avenue, which had been done about three years ago.

201
00:19:44,429 --> 00:19:50,874
[SPEAKER_12]: That actually was done on behalf of a project in Somerville as part of its state's MEPA review process.

202
00:19:51,634 --> 00:19:55,517
[SPEAKER_12]: That was the assembly project in Assembly Square section of Somerville.

203
00:19:56,658 --> 00:20:03,463
[SPEAKER_12]: that project already is obligated to pick up and implement the majority of those improvements that were identified.

204
00:20:04,224 --> 00:20:25,820
[SPEAKER_12]: So when we talked to the staff the other day, what we tried to do was identify improvements that this project could quickly and easily implement without there being a lot of engineering soft costs or permitting or complexities of that nature, stuff where the most bang for the buck could be put out there to quickly fix existing problems.

205
00:20:26,448 --> 00:20:28,489
[SPEAKER_12]: really unrelated to the new use in here.

206
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:34,393
[SPEAKER_12]: So what we had done was put together a rough graphic highlighting some of these.

207
00:20:35,193 --> 00:20:42,538
[SPEAKER_12]: I did forward this to the city staff very late in the day, so I don't know that they've had a chance to review it, but I can walk you through.

208
00:20:42,578 --> 00:20:44,319
[SPEAKER_12]: These are just some ideas that we have.

209
00:20:44,929 --> 00:20:46,970
[SPEAKER_12]: as to what could possibly be done out here.

210
00:20:48,371 --> 00:20:54,256
[SPEAKER_12]: The aerial's oriented in the same way as the site plan, so hopefully this'll be fairly easy to follow along with.

211
00:20:54,956 --> 00:21:12,028
[SPEAKER_12]: But I guess I can start in the right side and work my way left, where Riverside Avenue, as you depart the signal at the Fellsway, Route 28, the speed limit as all city roadways is 25 miles an hour, is the de facto speed limit.

212
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:15,524
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's a sign posting that as people depart the intersection.

213
00:21:16,424 --> 00:21:24,011
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't have exact measurements, but I know anecdotally there's been some speeding concerns there as people leave a congested roadway.

214
00:21:24,031 --> 00:21:29,676
[SPEAKER_12]: A lot of times they pick up their speed as they head around the corner past commercial street.

215
00:21:30,216 --> 00:21:38,784
[SPEAKER_12]: So what we were suggesting was that this project possibly implement a, what's called a speed feedback sign as shown in the picture there.

216
00:21:38,824 --> 00:21:40,285
[SPEAKER_12]: And you've probably seen these where

217
00:21:41,002 --> 00:21:47,605
[SPEAKER_12]: It posts the speed limit, but at the same time, it also shows actually how fast you're going as a reminder to bring it down.

218
00:21:49,085 --> 00:21:55,128
[SPEAKER_12]: Obviously, police enforcement is always the best way of doing this, but they can't be out there every hour of every day.

219
00:21:55,697 --> 00:22:02,800
[SPEAKER_12]: So this serves as a reminder to motorists and studies have shown it's actually pretty effective at keeping speeds down.

220
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:10,823
[SPEAKER_12]: So as part of this project, I had identified a potential spot for that where it's right around where people start to pick up the speed.

221
00:22:11,603 --> 00:22:15,825
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that would be a good location and it's relatively easy to put in.

222
00:22:15,865 --> 00:22:23,248
[SPEAKER_12]: This is actually solar powered and it does appear there's room within the city right away where this could be put along the

223
00:22:24,462 --> 00:22:28,187
[SPEAKER_12]: northerly side of Riverside Avenue facing that westbound traffic.

224
00:22:29,088 --> 00:22:32,673
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's something this project could take on and implement pretty quickly.

225
00:22:33,654 --> 00:22:39,923
[SPEAKER_12]: Moving to the left at the, I guess main driveway feeding the plaza off of Riverside Avenue.

226
00:22:40,961 --> 00:22:48,564
[SPEAKER_12]: Probably, I'm trying to think how many years ago, but there was striping that was put in at the intersection, commonly referred to as don't block the box.

227
00:22:49,224 --> 00:22:51,865
[SPEAKER_12]: Simply put, it's striping on the roadway.

228
00:22:51,985 --> 00:22:59,787
[SPEAKER_12]: So vehicles that are queued up at the signal don't block the driveway, which can be frustrating for people entering and exiting the site.

229
00:23:00,688 --> 00:23:03,529
[SPEAKER_12]: That striping was put in place, but over time it's faded.

230
00:23:04,169 --> 00:23:10,371
[SPEAKER_12]: So we were suggesting that's something we could pretty readily go out and re-stripe to get that effectiveness back where it needs to be.

231
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:13,572
[SPEAKER_12]: something would be looking to do in conjunction with this.

232
00:23:15,252 --> 00:23:21,314
[SPEAKER_12]: Another theme that came up in the roadway safety audit was the need for bike accommodations in the area.

233
00:23:22,014 --> 00:23:29,436
[SPEAKER_12]: And one pretty obvious deficiency we picked off through the project team was that there is a series of bike racks.

234
00:23:29,656 --> 00:23:34,678
[SPEAKER_12]: It's eight racks capable of holding about 16 vehicles right in front of the paper store.

235
00:23:35,258 --> 00:23:38,399
[SPEAKER_12]: That's right along the main drive aisle, extending out to route 28.

236
00:23:39,763 --> 00:23:47,545
[SPEAKER_12]: And that drive aisle is about 35 feet wide today, which is more than ample for a single lane in each direction.

237
00:23:48,546 --> 00:23:52,147
[SPEAKER_12]: The problem with that is that the speeds tend to pick up because it is so wide.

238
00:23:52,807 --> 00:23:58,349
[SPEAKER_12]: So what we were looking to do, if you look on the top side of that section, it's 35 feet curb to curb.

239
00:23:58,969 --> 00:24:00,809
[SPEAKER_12]: We're looking simply to restripe that.

240
00:24:00,949 --> 00:24:05,731
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's the two 12 foot lanes, and we can work with the city staff to figure if those should be 12 or 11.

241
00:24:06,998 --> 00:24:13,481
[SPEAKER_12]: basically maintaining single travel lanes in each direction, but introducing bike lanes on both sides of the roadway.

242
00:24:14,142 --> 00:24:19,664
[SPEAKER_12]: And this has the combined effect of giving a clearly designated, hopefully safer area for the bikers.

243
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:28,789
[SPEAKER_12]: And on the same side, it also effectively narrows the drivable width of the roadway for cars, which hopefully has a corresponding reduction in speeds.

244
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:34,252
[SPEAKER_12]: So that seemed like a pretty obvious connection where you have the bike racks up near the storefront,

245
00:24:34,831 --> 00:24:40,476
[SPEAKER_12]: bikers coming off of the Fellsway and really no accommodations for them in between.

246
00:24:40,616 --> 00:24:43,078
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's something that we could pretty quickly put in place.

247
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:48,782
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, this is information like probably an hour ago, I just passed it along to the city staff.

248
00:24:49,303 --> 00:25:00,612
[SPEAKER_12]: So I don't think they've had a chance to review, but I think it's in the spirit of what they were looking for, where it's quick, effective, not a lot of permitting or engineering design, but something that can help some existing deficiencies.

249
00:25:01,797 --> 00:25:07,298
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'd be happy to take any questions you might have on that, or I can just turn this back to Kathleen for further discussion.

250
00:25:09,879 --> 00:25:26,162
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, let me just take a moment, because this is new information, to invite Medford traffic engineer, Todd Blake, or city engineer, Tim McGivern, if they want to make any comments or respond to this at this point.

251
00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:31,020
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, thank you.

252
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:35,503
[SPEAKER_20]: This is Todd Blake, Director of Traffic and Transition for the City of Medford.

253
00:25:36,684 --> 00:25:56,379
[SPEAKER_20]: We did receive this, as Patrick said, later, but it does seem to fit the theme of what we were requesting to improve safety and enhance either pedestrian and or cycling to the site with the hopes of reducing vehicle trips, which would therefore mitigate some of the impact of vehicle trips.

254
00:25:59,041 --> 00:25:59,982
[SPEAKER_20]: Can everyone hear me okay?

255
00:26:00,718 --> 00:26:00,959
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

256
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:01,201
[SPEAKER_20]: OK.

257
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:21,226
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I think they did a good job with trying to identify, and we do recognize that what Patrick said earlier, from the road safety audit, some other project, I guess, is going to provide those things, but they haven't yet.

258
00:26:22,226 --> 00:26:24,667
[SPEAKER_20]: But this is a good alternative, I think.

259
00:26:25,527 --> 00:26:31,849
[SPEAKER_20]: There were a few other components that I noticed that could improve safety that seemed,

260
00:26:32,789 --> 00:26:34,711
[SPEAKER_20]: Pretty, you know, pretty minimal.

261
00:26:35,131 --> 00:26:44,196
[SPEAKER_20]: And if they're going to be out striping the site anyways for that drive out the three existing driveways along 28.

262
00:26:47,238 --> 00:26:57,321
[SPEAKER_20]: the ones that are exit or right exit only, but yet there's no right turn only markings or no left turn signage to indicate such.

263
00:26:57,841 --> 00:27:02,643
[SPEAKER_20]: So if someone's leaving the site, there's the potential for people to turn left onto 28.

264
00:27:05,024 --> 00:27:07,225
[SPEAKER_20]: southbound incorrectly.

265
00:27:07,305 --> 00:27:09,907
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's something that could be considered as well.

266
00:27:10,227 --> 00:27:18,053
[SPEAKER_20]: But I think they did a great job trying to accommodate what the intent was to reduce vehicle trips and to improve safety.

267
00:27:18,093 --> 00:27:21,635
[SPEAKER_09]: Great, thank you, Mr. Blake.

268
00:27:23,517 --> 00:27:27,319
[SPEAKER_09]: Do board members have any questions or comments about this part of the presentation?

269
00:27:29,561 --> 00:27:30,962
[SPEAKER_25]: Andre, I had a couple of questions.

270
00:27:32,133 --> 00:27:33,614
[SPEAKER_25]: I just wanted, can you hear me?

271
00:27:34,174 --> 00:27:34,614
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

272
00:27:34,654 --> 00:27:44,357
[SPEAKER_25]: I just wanted to understand why none of the recommendations from Todd at the signalized intersection were included.

273
00:27:44,457 --> 00:27:47,478
[SPEAKER_25]: That is because they're already proposed to be done.

274
00:27:48,078 --> 00:27:54,581
[SPEAKER_25]: Because obviously if an RSA was done, that means that it's one of the state's top high crash locations.

275
00:27:56,101 --> 00:28:01,523
[SPEAKER_25]: And some of them seemed like low hanging fruit, like checking the yellow and all red clearance intervals.

276
00:28:03,444 --> 00:28:04,405
[SPEAKER_25]: and adding back plates.

277
00:28:04,445 --> 00:28:06,767
[SPEAKER_25]: So I was just wondering why those were not included.

278
00:28:07,628 --> 00:28:13,414
[SPEAKER_11]: We should actually clarify the road safety audit was not done because of being a high crash location.

279
00:28:13,454 --> 00:28:21,862
[SPEAKER_11]: It was done because of the project, because a private developer paid for it as part of their project down by Assembly Road.

280
00:28:22,563 --> 00:28:23,004
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

281
00:28:23,064 --> 00:28:25,887
[SPEAKER_25]: It is a H-SIP cluster, I believe.

282
00:28:27,217 --> 00:28:29,779
[SPEAKER_12]: If I can weigh in on that, it's actually a combination of the two.

283
00:28:29,899 --> 00:28:42,729
[SPEAKER_12]: The study was done because it is in fact a high crash location and the state agency, MEPA, determined that that project should take that study on and implement the low cost improvements that were identified.

284
00:28:43,489 --> 00:28:53,357
[SPEAKER_12]: The study identified, I think the number was about 40 low cost improvements, and they are obligated to put those in place, which includes some of the ones that you mentioned.

285
00:28:55,786 --> 00:29:11,230
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, because there are a lot of concerning things about that intersection that are clear, like violations of any of the, you know, MUTCD or ADA requirements.

286
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:16,391
[SPEAKER_25]: So, but if they're going to be done anyways, then.

287
00:29:17,671 --> 00:29:18,611
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I think.

288
00:29:18,792 --> 00:29:20,552
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I'm sorry, Pat, I don't mean to interrupt.

289
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:22,150
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll be quick on this.

290
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:32,452
[SPEAKER_12]: And to be clear, some of the signal related items that were identified are listed in what they categorize as medium cost being anywhere from 10,000 to 50,000.

291
00:29:33,213 --> 00:29:40,234
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know the city's memorandum had suggested around a $12,000 impact roughly for this project.

292
00:29:40,834 --> 00:29:43,475
[SPEAKER_12]: So once we take on some of the signal elements,

293
00:29:44,239 --> 00:29:46,301
[SPEAKER_12]: which I agree, there's a lot of deficiencies out here.

294
00:29:46,441 --> 00:29:54,448
[SPEAKER_12]: But in terms of getting actual improvements in place, the stuff that I outlined earlier, we can actually make happen pretty quick and pretty effectively.

295
00:29:54,988 --> 00:30:10,781
[SPEAKER_12]: Whereas the signal improvements, to any degree, a lot of that money is going to go towards, well, basically me and my company, which is great, but a lot of it's going to get absorbed in permitting, as opposed to actual improvements on the road, which is why we tried to find stuff that we could make happen quicker.

296
00:30:10,801 --> 00:30:13,283
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

297
00:30:14,282 --> 00:30:14,942
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Pat.

298
00:30:17,083 --> 00:30:26,407
[SPEAKER_09]: Other board members have questions, and just a reminder to, because we have this on the screen, to state your name before speaking.

299
00:30:30,588 --> 00:30:31,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Andre, David.

300
00:30:32,009 --> 00:30:32,529
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, David.

301
00:30:32,709 --> 00:30:33,029
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead.

302
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:41,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Just was curious to hear the reaction to Mr. Blake's suggestion about the right turn only signage.

303
00:30:43,992 --> 00:30:48,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that something that could fall within the scope of these proposed improvements?

304
00:30:52,738 --> 00:31:01,963
[SPEAKER_12]: Assuming that one's over to me, again, what we tried to do was find items that were directly under city control and city jurisdiction.

305
00:31:02,664 --> 00:31:07,627
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not going to pretend that a right turn on red is a complicated matter, but it is a DCR signal.

306
00:31:08,187 --> 00:31:11,950
[SPEAKER_12]: So it introduces an outside state agency where

307
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:17,035
[SPEAKER_12]: we felt we could do things more effectively and more applicable instead of that.

308
00:31:17,136 --> 00:31:21,079
[SPEAKER_12]: Not to say that measure isn't needed, just maybe not on behalf of this project.

309
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:27,062
[SPEAKER_09]: Lanford and this is Andre LaRue, the chair.

310
00:31:27,102 --> 00:31:29,124
[SPEAKER_09]: I do have two questions myself.

311
00:31:29,704 --> 00:31:34,548
[SPEAKER_09]: One is along Riverside Avenue with this, the 25 mile per hour speed limit sign.

312
00:31:34,928 --> 00:31:49,119
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm wondering if there's, if you think it might be worthwhile pulling it back closer to the intersection, because just knowing how vehicles exit from the plaza over the box, and then usually there's like site,

313
00:31:51,384 --> 00:31:56,806
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, problems with vehicles that are coming quickly down Riverside Ave the other way.

314
00:31:56,826 --> 00:32:11,872
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if you think it might be worth putting the signage closer, like before the box, or if there's some other way of improving safety there for those that are turning left out of the plaza onto Riverside Ave heading east.

315
00:32:13,032 --> 00:32:16,814
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, the current location does capture those exiting the plaza.

316
00:32:17,398 --> 00:32:21,200
[SPEAKER_12]: We could look at maybe shifting it another 150 feet or so.

317
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:34,605
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think I'd want it between the signal and the driveway to the plaza, and I don't think you're suggesting that, but I think maybe a little bit closer to the intersection we could certainly look at, as long as we're still capturing those people coming out of the plaza.

318
00:32:35,306 --> 00:32:42,929
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, that speed limit is more global, that's citywide, that's not just for this roadway, but it's a good reminder, which is why the sign's there.

319
00:32:43,589 --> 00:32:45,270
[SPEAKER_12]: So yes, we could certainly look at moving that.

320
00:32:46,377 --> 00:32:51,043
[SPEAKER_09]: And I do, you know, I appreciate the suggestions that you put forth here.

321
00:32:51,363 --> 00:33:01,455
[SPEAKER_09]: The other one that I do have though that I don't see is in terms of the bike racks, the existing bike racks are not really great bike racks that are there.

322
00:33:01,515 --> 00:33:03,438
[SPEAKER_09]: They were really just like thrown in some...

323
00:33:03,878 --> 00:33:27,472
[SPEAKER_09]: you know cement and literally there's like you're standing next to a very busy parking area it's on an island so I'm wondering whether there's and there's no bike racks I don't believe towards the end of the plaza where you know this project will be happening so I'm wondering whether there's an opportunity to put in bike racks down that end of the plaza.

324
00:33:29,093 --> 00:33:31,655
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd need to take a closer look at the site plan for that

325
00:33:33,188 --> 00:33:35,510
[SPEAKER_12]: The bike racks where they are certainly serviceable.

326
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:42,156
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd need to see if that involves eliminating parking spaces or other geometric space changes.

327
00:33:42,457 --> 00:33:47,822
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'd need to consult with a tie and bond on that one as to if there's room to put an additional bike racks.

328
00:33:48,302 --> 00:33:50,904
[SPEAKER_12]: Not a huge expense and there's a lot of bang for the buck there.

329
00:33:51,325 --> 00:33:52,186
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're not against it.

330
00:33:52,226 --> 00:33:55,729
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to make sure I can deliver if I promised that something would do.

331
00:33:56,974 --> 00:34:16,945
[SPEAKER_13]: Out of the difficulty with the parking spaces that that Patrick mentioned and I included it in the written statement is that that the owner of the parcel is subject to a three way agreement between the other owners that require that they maintain a certain level of parking spaces that they can't go below.

332
00:34:17,746 --> 00:34:25,150
[SPEAKER_13]: That is a restriction it's a deed restriction contained and all the deeds and I believe I gave the deed citation in my.

333
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:34,176
[SPEAKER_13]: in my written statement, and I have a copy of the restriction as well, but they're very limited in some ways as to what they can do with parking.

334
00:34:35,637 --> 00:34:41,101
[SPEAKER_13]: I know in speaking with Karen Johnson that they've tried to negotiate the changes in that agreement to no avail.

335
00:34:42,182 --> 00:34:50,929
[SPEAKER_13]: So at this point, if it takes a parking space, that's gonna create issues with the other two abutters per the agreement, and that agreement runs through 2035.

336
00:34:55,825 --> 00:34:58,267
[SPEAKER_18]: Can I ask a question following up on that?

337
00:34:58,287 --> 00:35:01,009
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, please.

338
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:14,781
[SPEAKER_18]: I assume that there's a certain amount of parking that's being given to this project as part of the project, or is it a pooled parking arrangement?

339
00:35:18,813 --> 00:35:28,759
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a pool parking lot to the extent that there's more parking than is required for any of the various businesses.

340
00:35:28,799 --> 00:35:35,303
[SPEAKER_13]: In other words, the requirement is one per 350 square feet floor area.

341
00:35:35,703 --> 00:35:46,569
[SPEAKER_13]: And the parking as it stands now under the agreement is 4.1 parking spaces per 1,000 square feet as between the three owners of the development.

342
00:35:47,975 --> 00:35:55,917
[SPEAKER_13]: there is definitely sufficient parking within the property to accommodate the use that's being used.

343
00:35:56,637 --> 00:36:14,960
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, I guess where I'm going with this is I'm just wondering if this project would offer to give up parking space or to create an enhanced bike parking area, which seems like probably a good location to do it in front of

344
00:36:15,613 --> 00:36:23,896
[SPEAKER_18]: this parcel because it's sort of right on the corner, right at the center of the mall.

345
00:36:23,916 --> 00:36:27,157
[SPEAKER_18]: It would be good for access to the whole thing.

346
00:36:27,537 --> 00:36:36,620
[SPEAKER_18]: I definitely second what Andre asked, I think, including an enhanced bike area for the whole.

347
00:36:38,407 --> 00:36:40,508
[SPEAKER_13]: It's certainly something that we could look at.

348
00:36:40,608 --> 00:36:46,552
[SPEAKER_13]: And as Patrick said, he doesn't know without looking at it further, whether it would even require spaces to be eliminated.

349
00:36:48,193 --> 00:36:58,319
[SPEAKER_13]: But then we may, based on the agreement, have to find spaces elsewhere to stay at the threshold that's required per the agreement, unfortunately.

350
00:36:58,419 --> 00:37:06,964
[SPEAKER_18]: I know there are equations involved, but I also know that 99.99% of the time, this parking lot's half empty.

351
00:37:09,736 --> 00:37:12,339
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, my second question was, um.

352
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:20,026
[SPEAKER_18]: Have you considered the addition of any trees and around, um, the parking areas here?

353
00:37:20,867 --> 00:37:21,127
[SPEAKER_13]: So in

354
00:37:26,372 --> 00:37:30,834
[SPEAKER_13]: switch to, I think it's the site plan that shows where we have.

355
00:37:31,814 --> 00:37:49,162
[SPEAKER_13]: So in terms of this particular project, and if you compare this particular parcel with the parcels adjacent to it, the Fellsway has really tried to do landscaping in those areas that would allow them to maintain the

356
00:37:51,372 --> 00:38:07,452
[SPEAKER_13]: parking requirements that are required if you look they, and this is just a sample I have quite a few photos of of trees that they have planted and plantings and they're much more mature at this point than they were but they have basically attempted to put landscaping in those areas where

357
00:38:08,513 --> 00:38:09,394
[SPEAKER_13]: they're permitted to.

358
00:38:09,414 --> 00:38:25,512
[SPEAKER_13]: In addition they maintain season planters you'll see on on front of all of the buildings and those rotate between spring, fall and summer plantings and they've put benches in and I know that the chairman

359
00:38:26,193 --> 00:38:33,857
[SPEAKER_13]: takes issue with the types of bike racks that are in there, but they have attempted to do those things which the board likes to see.

360
00:38:33,937 --> 00:38:49,305
[SPEAKER_13]: And we knew this was going to be a question, certainly, but the issue is really what they're bound to in terms of the agreement with the other two owners and the spaces that they have or the spaces that are required.

361
00:38:50,986 --> 00:38:53,087
[SPEAKER_13]: And I can, if I can share my, I can actually.

362
00:38:54,723 --> 00:38:55,424
[SPEAKER_10]: share my screen.

363
00:38:55,444 --> 00:38:55,964
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, Kathleen.

364
00:38:56,024 --> 00:38:56,925
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Karen Johnson.

365
00:39:00,727 --> 00:39:07,212
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure, just before you do that, Kathleen, I just noticed that the... Karen, I'm sorry, could you introduce yourself, please?

366
00:39:07,692 --> 00:39:08,452
[SPEAKER_10]: I apologize.

367
00:39:08,753 --> 00:39:09,733
[SPEAKER_10]: Karen Johnson.

368
00:39:10,114 --> 00:39:12,255
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm with Charter Realty and Development.

369
00:39:12,335 --> 00:39:14,376
[SPEAKER_10]: We're the owners of Fellsway Plaza.

370
00:39:14,456 --> 00:39:15,357
[SPEAKER_10]: We've owned it since 2013.

371
00:39:16,178 --> 00:39:20,861
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just noticing, to your point about bike racks,

372
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:31,253
[SPEAKER_10]: There's diagonal parking in front of the proposed BioLife right at the, exactly, thank you, John, right at the notch, really, of the building.

373
00:39:31,853 --> 00:39:39,375
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we could probably slide those diagonal spaces down, because you see there's an area in the front that's striped.

374
00:39:39,515 --> 00:39:46,857
[SPEAKER_10]: We could slide those down and do a small area for bike racks at the end of that parking row.

375
00:39:46,897 --> 00:39:50,638
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that would work out nicely without losing any spaces.

376
00:39:52,909 --> 00:39:53,770
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be welcome.

377
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:55,350
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for the suggestion.

378
00:39:57,312 --> 00:40:00,073
[SPEAKER_10]: And we can take a closer look at the surface.

379
00:40:00,954 --> 00:40:02,675
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks like it's crushed stone.

380
00:40:02,935 --> 00:40:08,098
[SPEAKER_10]: I have not biked there and parked my bike there, but it looks like it's crushed stone.

381
00:40:08,138 --> 00:40:14,122
[SPEAKER_10]: So we can take a look at the surface or even doing some sort of

382
00:40:15,018 --> 00:40:25,991
[SPEAKER_10]: protection around the perimeter, whether it's making the curb height slightly higher or even a low level wood fence or something like a wood guardrail.

383
00:40:26,331 --> 00:40:33,780
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, those are very, very simple things for us to implement, and if it makes it more attractive for

384
00:40:34,486 --> 00:40:37,508
[SPEAKER_10]: bikers to bike to this location, I think it's to everyone's benefit.

385
00:40:37,528 --> 00:40:40,130
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think those are two very good points that you made.

386
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:45,613
[SPEAKER_10]: We can certainly take a closer look at implementing those and work with staff.

387
00:40:47,375 --> 00:40:52,878
[SPEAKER_13]: Karen, in terms of the history, could you just, because you have made certain landscaping improvements.

388
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:58,862
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think when you drive through that area, it's really the only area that's landscaped.

389
00:40:59,483 --> 00:41:02,185
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think you've done what you can.

390
00:41:02,205 --> 00:41:04,026
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that fair to say?

391
00:41:05,397 --> 00:41:29,805
[SPEAKER_10]: It is a challenge, and right after we purchased the property, we were able to redevelop that down abandoned parcel adjacent to Riverside, which has been very successful, and three restaurants, and we're very pleased that they're still doing fairly well, even through this rather difficult period for restaurant operators.

392
00:41:32,542 --> 00:41:33,723
[SPEAKER_10]: permitted Planet Fitness.

393
00:41:33,763 --> 00:41:38,346
[SPEAKER_10]: So those two applications involved special permits.

394
00:41:39,107 --> 00:41:48,753
[SPEAKER_10]: When we came through with the Planet Fitness application, we did make several, and I think these photos are helpful.

395
00:41:50,294 --> 00:41:55,738
[SPEAKER_10]: We did make several improvements to those existing

396
00:41:56,912 --> 00:41:57,953
[SPEAKER_10]: landscape areas.

397
00:41:57,993 --> 00:42:00,795
[SPEAKER_10]: And these photos were actually taken right after the landscaping went in.

398
00:42:00,835 --> 00:42:02,676
[SPEAKER_10]: They're a bit more mature now and fuller.

399
00:42:03,856 --> 00:42:09,480
[SPEAKER_10]: We also maintained, which I think was something that the prior owner did not do out there.

400
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:19,246
[SPEAKER_10]: As Kathleen mentioned, this is a property that was originally, is originally part of three different owners.

401
00:42:19,366 --> 00:42:20,407
[SPEAKER_10]: It was developed in 1915.

402
00:42:21,543 --> 00:42:24,705
[SPEAKER_10]: in terms of what we can do for uses for what we can do for new

403
00:42:48,061 --> 00:42:49,722
[SPEAKER_10]: We are grossly over parked.

404
00:42:49,762 --> 00:42:51,723
[SPEAKER_10]: I understand that, but we cannot change it.

405
00:42:51,784 --> 00:42:52,544
[SPEAKER_10]: It's unfortunate.

406
00:42:52,944 --> 00:42:57,587
[SPEAKER_10]: There are so many things that we would like to do here, but we are unable to do it.

407
00:42:57,827 --> 00:43:13,518
[SPEAKER_10]: And so what we're trying to do is re-tenant an existing space, add some life to the center in terms of foot traffic, and obviously re-letting out a 20,000 square foot space is really significant for us.

408
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:17,928
[SPEAKER_09]: for clarifying that.

409
00:43:18,689 --> 00:43:23,150
[SPEAKER_09]: And comments from any other board members before we open the hearing up to members of the public?

410
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:27,552
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, hearing none.

411
00:43:27,572 --> 00:43:31,213
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm wondering if we could stop sharing the screen here.

412
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:34,254
[SPEAKER_13]: We can see everyone.

413
00:43:34,314 --> 00:43:35,534
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, yeah.

414
00:43:36,215 --> 00:43:37,535
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, thank you, Attorney Desmond.

415
00:43:37,555 --> 00:43:38,775
[SPEAKER_09]: If you could review that, that'd be great.

416
00:43:39,196 --> 00:43:43,357
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure, and then if I can put that on my screen so that you have it as well.

417
00:43:45,362 --> 00:43:57,664
[SPEAKER_13]: So the request for waiver is all derived from section 94 334 c one, and and the first requires a location of use instructions within 100 feet of the property line.

418
00:43:58,445 --> 00:44:10,147
[SPEAKER_13]: The applicant is requesting a waiver from this requirement is the intended substitution of use does not contemplate any substantial exterior changes or modify the existing building which is over 50 years old so we're requesting.

419
00:44:10,958 --> 00:44:14,321
[SPEAKER_13]: that the plan not require those structures within 100 feet.

420
00:44:15,161 --> 00:44:19,505
[SPEAKER_13]: The second request requires locations elevations and dimensions section

421
00:44:20,269 --> 00:44:24,772
[SPEAKER_13]: of existing and proposed buildings or other structures showing setbacks from property lines.

422
00:44:25,132 --> 00:44:33,037
[SPEAKER_13]: While we showed much of that, we didn't show the elevations of the entire proposed structure and the structure isn't proposed, it's existing.

423
00:44:33,158 --> 00:44:39,742
[SPEAKER_13]: So the applicant is requesting a waiver from this requirement, particularly with regard to the elevations and dimensions of the existing building.

424
00:44:40,162 --> 00:44:47,347
[SPEAKER_13]: As a substitution relates only to a portion of the structure and does not contemplate substantial exterior changes or modifications to the building.

425
00:44:48,228 --> 00:44:53,190
[SPEAKER_13]: Section I requires existing and proposed contour elevations in one foot.

426
00:44:53,670 --> 00:45:02,613
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, we're not changing any of the exterior elements, and this is just essentially a retrofit of the interior of an existing space.

427
00:45:03,293 --> 00:45:05,134
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're asking for a waiver as to that.

428
00:45:06,154 --> 00:45:08,055
[SPEAKER_13]: J requires proposed surfacing.

429
00:45:08,455 --> 00:45:15,518
[SPEAKER_13]: The applicant is seeking a waiver from this requirement as there are no contemplated changes to the project site, including the existing sidewalks and parking areas.

430
00:45:17,508 --> 00:45:23,451
[SPEAKER_13]: O requires landscaping and screening, including trees, stone walls, fences, and other features to be retained or removed.

431
00:45:23,611 --> 00:45:32,715
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, this is a situation where we're not really changing the exterior of the structure, and it's only a portion of the building that is actually being retrofitted.

432
00:45:34,155 --> 00:45:37,957
[SPEAKER_13]: P, which requires outdoor lighting, including location and intensity of lighting.

433
00:45:38,857 --> 00:45:47,161
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, we're looking for a waiver of that requirement as this is a substitution of use, and there are no contemplated changes to the existing outdoor lighting.

434
00:45:47,915 --> 00:45:57,381
[SPEAKER_13]: And actually, I should mention too that as part of what they did in terms of improving the site I believe all of the lighting is LED lighting at this point.

435
00:45:57,801 --> 00:46:01,144
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's something to point out.

436
00:46:02,745 --> 00:46:05,486
[SPEAKER_13]: So those are the, the waivers that we're requesting.

437
00:46:06,067 --> 00:46:11,670
[SPEAKER_13]: And as the report from the city engineer indicates he took no exception to those requests.

438
00:46:13,712 --> 00:46:13,832
Great.

439
00:46:15,733 --> 00:46:16,914
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Attorney Desmond.

440
00:46:20,089 --> 00:46:24,390
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to open the hearing to members of the public.

441
00:46:26,771 --> 00:46:30,112
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there anyone who would like to speak?

442
00:46:31,492 --> 00:46:34,713
[SPEAKER_09]: You can raise your hands.

443
00:46:39,455 --> 00:46:42,335
[SPEAKER_09]: Or mention in the chat that you'd like to speak and we can unmute you.

444
00:46:44,376 --> 00:46:47,957
[SPEAKER_11]: And Andre Ken Cross has raised his hand, he'd like to speak.

445
00:46:49,668 --> 00:46:50,649
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, thank you, Ken.

446
00:46:51,389 --> 00:46:51,730
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead.

447
00:46:52,690 --> 00:46:56,493
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Ken Krause, 50 Mystic Street in Medford.

448
00:46:57,774 --> 00:47:03,158
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't have a comment pro or con the project.

449
00:47:03,238 --> 00:47:06,020
[SPEAKER_21]: I did want to share just a few observations from listening, though.

450
00:47:07,895 --> 00:47:21,303
[SPEAKER_21]: I was glad to see the emphasis in the traffic study on improving bicycle access, but there's still with the plaza overall is a very severe shortcoming in pedestrian access.

451
00:47:21,423 --> 00:47:26,286
[SPEAKER_21]: I believe there are seven vehicle accesses to the property.

452
00:47:26,566 --> 00:47:33,430
[SPEAKER_21]: And there's only one that has any kind of pedestrian lane, if you will, to get from the street.

453
00:47:34,588 --> 00:47:35,628
[SPEAKER_21]: to the complex.

454
00:47:36,269 --> 00:47:49,933
[SPEAKER_21]: Fortunately, that's the one that's the bike path, bike lanes are being added, but this isn't necessarily related to this addition or change, but from Riverside Avenue, it's very dangerous for people walking.

455
00:47:50,293 --> 00:47:55,335
[SPEAKER_21]: They turn into the entrance where all the vehicles are and just walk within the traffic.

456
00:47:55,355 --> 00:47:59,637
[SPEAKER_21]: And so at some point, it would be helpful to try to correct that.

457
00:48:00,037 --> 00:48:03,798
[SPEAKER_21]: The second thing is I think the part, the comment about

458
00:48:04,926 --> 00:48:06,558
[SPEAKER_21]: the site being grossly over parked.

459
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:10,602
[SPEAKER_21]: is true, but I disagree that you can't change it.

460
00:48:10,642 --> 00:48:21,527
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, there may be restrictions, but I think there is an opportunity to relook at that in a new way, particularly through the city's vulnerability preparedness program.

461
00:48:22,007 --> 00:48:26,469
[SPEAKER_21]: We're looking at heat islands throughout the city and ways to reduce those.

462
00:48:26,589 --> 00:48:36,433
[SPEAKER_21]: And just looking at this aerial view, I would suspect that this is a heat island, and perhaps there's a way to reduce the parking through some program or effort through the municipal

463
00:48:38,035 --> 00:48:39,376
[SPEAKER_21]: vulnerability preparedness.

464
00:48:39,736 --> 00:48:50,022
[SPEAKER_21]: And then just the last comment, if I could, for the Community Development Board, for the benefit of the public, it would be very helpful if more information about these plans could be presented in the agenda.

465
00:48:50,062 --> 00:48:54,605
[SPEAKER_21]: A lot of people find out about these projects through the agenda, and 640 to 760 Fellsway

466
00:48:57,171 --> 00:49:00,492
[SPEAKER_21]: is a large complex and it could be any number of buildings.

467
00:49:00,572 --> 00:49:13,675
[SPEAKER_21]: There's some other vacancies there and no information about what is proposed, what's the nature of the business that's going in that I think is very vague and more information that could be put through the agenda would be very helpful.

468
00:49:13,715 --> 00:49:20,157
[SPEAKER_21]: So for future meetings, I would ask that you consider that in addition to any public hearing notice that might appear in the paper.

469
00:49:20,577 --> 00:49:20,817
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

470
00:49:22,005 --> 00:49:22,465
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks, Ken.

471
00:49:22,485 --> 00:49:25,008
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are all great points.

472
00:49:25,408 --> 00:49:30,512
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm wondering if Karen would like to respond to any of them.

473
00:49:35,236 --> 00:49:45,105
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think maybe we say things like reciprocal easement agreement with two other parties, and it's not entirely clear what that means.

474
00:49:46,826 --> 00:49:47,927
[SPEAKER_10]: It's effectively a

475
00:49:49,668 --> 00:49:53,631
[SPEAKER_10]: a set of covenants and restrictions within the deed.

476
00:49:53,711 --> 00:50:02,157
[SPEAKER_10]: It's recorded in the land records and every property owner is bound by it and successors and title until 2035.

477
00:50:02,197 --> 00:50:03,638
[SPEAKER_10]: And as I noted earlier,

478
00:50:07,988 --> 00:50:12,610
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I misspoke in that the property was developed in 1959.

479
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:14,191
[SPEAKER_10]: It was not.

480
00:50:14,271 --> 00:50:17,372
[SPEAKER_10]: It was already developed prior to that.

481
00:50:17,452 --> 00:50:22,514
[SPEAKER_10]: But in 1959, these three property owners entered into this agreement.

482
00:50:22,834 --> 00:50:30,877
[SPEAKER_10]: And the agreement was intended to, in some ways, protect all of the property owners from competing uses.

483
00:50:31,518 --> 00:50:36,660
[SPEAKER_10]: In other ways, it was to provide benefits to all of the property owners for

484
00:50:37,355 --> 00:50:41,217
[SPEAKER_10]: the purposes of having reciprocal easements.

485
00:50:41,418 --> 00:50:46,121
[SPEAKER_10]: So each party to the agreement is the beneficiary of these easements.

486
00:50:46,821 --> 00:50:57,648
[SPEAKER_10]: So a reciprocal easement agreement essentially says, I as a property owner am going to agree to all of these restrictions, and I'm also going to get all the benefits of it.

487
00:50:58,368 --> 00:51:02,091
[SPEAKER_10]: And so this was actually renewed in the late 80s.

488
00:51:02,151 --> 00:51:04,012
[SPEAKER_10]: I forget exactly, I think it was 1988.

489
00:51:04,612 --> 00:51:05,573
[SPEAKER_10]: It was renewed.

490
00:51:07,635 --> 00:51:14,021
[SPEAKER_10]: an entire new set of restrictions and somewhat benefits were agreed to at that time.

491
00:51:14,541 --> 00:51:31,637
[SPEAKER_10]: And one of those was the restriction that each property owner and throughout the entire three properties maintain a ratio in Kathleen, it's 4.5 spaces per thousand square feet of floor area.

492
00:51:32,438 --> 00:51:43,206
[SPEAKER_10]: And so when I say it's grossly over-parked, I say that in relation to what we know now in terms of shared parking offset peak uses.

493
00:51:43,786 --> 00:51:53,213
[SPEAKER_10]: Really, if you laid this out and did an ITE analysis, for example, on shared uses, you would probably need no more than, you know,

494
00:51:54,050 --> 00:51:58,792
[SPEAKER_10]: three and a half, maybe per thousand, maybe, that's probably even high.

495
00:51:58,872 --> 00:52:03,274
[SPEAKER_10]: We know that the City of Medford requirements are also much lower than that.

496
00:52:03,894 --> 00:52:07,456
[SPEAKER_10]: So we almost have to wait this out until 2035.

497
00:52:07,596 --> 00:52:16,760
[SPEAKER_10]: We've already tried on several instances to come to an understanding with the other parties to this agreement

498
00:52:17,763 --> 00:52:20,845
[SPEAKER_10]: We've been trying since prior to when we bought the property.

499
00:52:21,085 --> 00:52:23,427
[SPEAKER_10]: We bought it in 2013, as I noted.

500
00:52:23,867 --> 00:52:33,993
[SPEAKER_10]: Before we even closed on it, we reached out to Kimco and we reached out to Ocean State, and they're still the same owners of the other properties, saying, look, let's modernize this.

501
00:52:34,074 --> 00:52:38,236
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's look at taking out some of these use restrictions that we're all subject to.

502
00:52:38,716 --> 00:52:44,260
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's look at doing some different and interesting things collectively with Fellsway Plaza.

503
00:52:45,171 --> 00:52:47,152
[SPEAKER_10]: and we got nowhere.

504
00:52:47,432 --> 00:52:49,652
[SPEAKER_10]: And frankly, we try every year.

505
00:52:51,173 --> 00:52:54,334
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the restrictions is there's a view line easement.

506
00:52:54,994 --> 00:53:14,259
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you saw from John Lorden's, from Ty and Bond's plan, there's a very dark line that goes across parallel to the frontages of both Kimco's property and perpendicular to Ocean State's property, which I'm sure you're aware used to be stop and shop.

507
00:53:14,872 --> 00:53:19,635
[SPEAKER_10]: Those are restrictive areas that regardless of zoning, we cannot build on.

508
00:53:20,116 --> 00:53:22,057
[SPEAKER_10]: We can't even put a pylon sign on it.

509
00:53:22,798 --> 00:53:24,279
[SPEAKER_10]: So I hear you.

510
00:53:25,079 --> 00:53:35,947
[SPEAKER_10]: There are lots of great things that we all know about now that the property owners, I think in the 80s when they renegotiated this agreement, didn't know about.

511
00:53:36,958 --> 00:53:48,526
[SPEAKER_10]: As we approach 2035, if we're still the owners of this property, trust me, many of these things will be renegotiated in a positive manner because we see tremendous value in this location.

512
00:53:49,686 --> 00:53:56,771
[SPEAKER_10]: I've had several conversations with Todd and Tim, most recently Tim, about what can we do.

513
00:53:57,391 --> 00:53:59,593
[SPEAKER_10]: We also own the Tower Plaza in the rear.

514
00:53:59,613 --> 00:54:05,777
[SPEAKER_10]: Our architect, Tom Scott, is also available if you have any questions about the architecture and the design.

515
00:54:06,257 --> 00:54:11,960
[SPEAKER_10]: We've looked at many feasibility analysis, obviously, with something like Wellington Circle developed.

516
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:15,781
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the next logical step to a transit-oriented development.

517
00:54:16,362 --> 00:54:31,788
[SPEAKER_10]: We'd love to do so many things here, and we'll hopefully wait this out, and we'll be talking to you in 2035 about what a great, new, modern, sustainable project we can present to you.

518
00:54:32,069 --> 00:54:32,789
[SPEAKER_10]: And until then,

519
00:54:33,611 --> 00:54:37,616
[SPEAKER_10]: we have to figure out a way to make this a financially viable project.

520
00:54:38,558 --> 00:54:40,280
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully we're all still around, Karen.

521
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:46,508
[SPEAKER_10]: I do appreciate your comments, Ken, and they're obviously very well informed.

522
00:54:47,109 --> 00:54:48,310
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm in agreement with you.

523
00:54:49,211 --> 00:54:50,032
[SPEAKER_10]: Right now we've got to

524
00:54:50,625 --> 00:54:52,146
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got to pay the bills, so.

525
00:54:52,586 --> 00:54:52,766
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

526
00:54:52,806 --> 00:54:55,587
[SPEAKER_09]: And so that sight line, I was shocked when I learned about this.

527
00:54:55,607 --> 00:54:59,129
[SPEAKER_09]: So that includes even planting trees because it can block the sight line.

528
00:54:59,169 --> 00:55:00,349
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that, that's correct, right?

529
00:55:00,389 --> 00:55:02,830
[SPEAKER_09]: Which is why the trees around the outside.

530
00:55:02,930 --> 00:55:07,713
[SPEAKER_10]: We can't put any more trees in there anyway, because we can't take off any, take away any parking spaces.

531
00:55:07,773 --> 00:55:13,575
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think, you know, again, I think it was, Todd had a great suggestion for the re-striping.

532
00:55:14,656 --> 00:55:19,858
[SPEAKER_10]: We will absolutely look at more opportunities for, for bicycle parking and make it a little more,

533
00:55:21,305 --> 00:55:23,386
[SPEAKER_10]: amenable to a bicyclist.

534
00:55:24,106 --> 00:55:25,146
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and I do.

535
00:55:25,326 --> 00:55:26,886
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I wish I brought this up myself.

536
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:28,367
[SPEAKER_09]: So Ken, thank you for doing it.

537
00:55:28,667 --> 00:55:34,988
[SPEAKER_09]: I do agree with the comment that people are walking to the plaza in the driveways.

538
00:55:35,468 --> 00:55:38,489
[SPEAKER_09]: So that is a pretty dangerous situation.

539
00:55:38,569 --> 00:55:43,370
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if there's anything that you could do to improve that situation.

540
00:55:45,280 --> 00:56:00,712
[SPEAKER_10]: We looked at it when we were doing the Planet Fitness project, and it does get a little cumbersome over there because the Riverside parcels, that's a whole other title issue, environmental story.

541
00:56:02,033 --> 00:56:05,596
[SPEAKER_10]: But that section, and John, I don't know if you can put your

542
00:56:06,141 --> 00:56:07,021
[SPEAKER_10]: your plan up again.

543
00:56:07,041 --> 00:56:08,082
[SPEAKER_10]: That section is very narrow.

544
00:56:08,102 --> 00:56:09,683
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't remember the exact dimension.

545
00:56:10,683 --> 00:56:24,029
[SPEAKER_10]: I know we looked at the possibility of adding a sidewalk at that point, and we could not make it work with the setbacks on the riverside and then with the amount of frontage that we own on the Fellsway side.

546
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:26,170
[SPEAKER_10]: But we'll take another look at it.

547
00:56:27,591 --> 00:56:28,471
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll take another look at it.

548
00:56:29,792 --> 00:56:30,352
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree with you.

549
00:56:33,923 --> 00:56:51,131
[SPEAKER_22]: I've wondered if I could just take a moment to address one of Ken's other comments, which had to do with, um, just access to plans, um, and like more information in the agenda, um, about, you know, the different projects on items on the list, um, wholeheartedly agree.

550
00:56:51,191 --> 00:56:54,353
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think moving forward, we're going to put more of that information on there.

551
00:56:54,833 --> 00:57:02,417
[SPEAKER_22]: Uh, but just for, so that folks know on the med on Medford's website page for the office of planning development and sustainability.

552
00:57:03,362 --> 00:57:19,534
[SPEAKER_22]: you scroll down to the community development board, there is a tab that says, um, current CD board filings and all of the, uh, open filings that are, um, you know, on the agenda, etcetera are all of the plans and information are nestled in there.

553
00:57:20,134 --> 00:57:23,877
[SPEAKER_22]: Um and that information is put in the public hearing notice.

554
00:57:24,177 --> 00:57:27,319
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, but I think moving forward will put that in the agenda as well.

555
00:57:27,739 --> 00:57:28,360
[SPEAKER_22]: So thank you can.

556
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:37,725
[SPEAKER_09]: Amanda and for those of you on zoom Alicia hunt our planning director put the link directly into the chat.

557
00:57:40,627 --> 00:57:40,787
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

558
00:57:42,187 --> 00:57:42,768
[SPEAKER_09]: Todd Blake.

559
00:57:44,663 --> 00:57:45,644
[SPEAKER_20]: I thank you, Mr. Chair.

560
00:57:46,024 --> 00:57:49,127
[SPEAKER_20]: I was just going to follow up on Ken's good comments about pedestrian access.

561
00:57:49,187 --> 00:57:52,370
[SPEAKER_20]: We did highlight that as well as the cycling access.

562
00:57:52,470 --> 00:58:04,020
[SPEAKER_20]: And there may be some things that may be easier, you know, possibly for the proponent to consider, like painting crosswalks across those driveways off of Fells Way.

563
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:11,646
[SPEAKER_20]: And then I'm looking at the other drive aisle, the other main drive aisle, that's the one way in from the signal.

564
00:58:12,773 --> 00:58:16,394
[SPEAKER_20]: And it also looks painted very wide for traveling in each direction.

565
00:58:17,034 --> 00:58:29,617
[SPEAKER_20]: So there may be the opportunity to paint, if you will, paint a shoulder, which may act as a walkway in lieu of a sidewalk, if a sidewalk was too much of an ask.

566
00:58:34,718 --> 00:58:36,378
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. Blake.

567
00:58:36,558 --> 00:58:38,779
[SPEAKER_09]: Any other members of the public would like to speak?

568
00:58:40,408 --> 00:58:46,913
[SPEAKER_09]: use the raise your hand function, or I don't know if the community development folks, if we've gotten any emails or phone calls.

569
00:58:51,796 --> 00:58:58,160
[SPEAKER_22]: I haven't, I'm gonna check now, but I don't believe we've received any emails or phone calls on the matter.

570
00:58:58,501 --> 00:59:01,223
[SPEAKER_22]: Give me one second just to look at the inbox.

571
00:59:03,512 --> 00:59:09,336
[SPEAKER_09]: And Attorney Desmond, in the meantime, there were some other letters by department heads, including the fire department.

572
00:59:10,057 --> 00:59:16,522
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no, no, no problems with any of the other department head comments.

573
00:59:16,562 --> 00:59:21,866
[SPEAKER_13]: And we had a very productive meeting and conversation with the engineering department.

574
00:59:22,426 --> 00:59:25,949
[SPEAKER_13]: It didn't occur till yesterday based on scheduling conflicts and vacations.

575
00:59:26,009 --> 00:59:28,831
[SPEAKER_13]: But, you know, I think it was beneficial to all.

576
00:59:33,028 --> 00:59:51,664
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I think we're getting close to the point of being able to entertain a motion with some kind of project, maybe mitigation that is negotiated by the city's traffic department.

577
00:59:53,506 --> 00:59:54,247
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think we can

578
00:59:55,700 --> 01:00:01,225
[SPEAKER_09]: give them the, we can delegate the responsibility to kind of finalize that package.

579
01:00:01,265 --> 01:00:03,788
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think what we've seen here tonight's a good step forward.

580
01:00:03,848 --> 01:00:11,095
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think what the proponent has exhibited some willingness to talk about that further.

581
01:00:11,115 --> 01:00:12,916
[SPEAKER_11]: Alicia?

582
01:00:12,936 --> 01:00:16,760
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, if I might, I just wanted to make sure.

583
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:19,022
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the comments in the engineering letter was

584
01:00:20,571 --> 01:00:29,823
[SPEAKER_11]: that the building might be within the jurisdiction of the Conservation Commission because we do know that there is wetland on the adjacent property.

585
01:00:30,370 --> 01:00:40,257
[SPEAKER_11]: We had the city's environmental agent, Dennis McDougal, review that, and he did the measurements and said that it's actually about 140 feet from the wetland.

586
01:00:40,357 --> 01:00:49,804
[SPEAKER_11]: While it's only 70 feet from the property line here, it is clearly sufficiently far from the wetland, in his opinion, that it's outside the jurisdiction.

587
01:00:50,224 --> 01:00:55,028
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just wanted to state that clearly for the record, since it was in the engineering letter,

588
01:00:55,588 --> 01:01:04,633
[SPEAKER_11]: Um Dennis did agree that the engineering suggestion that there should be perimeter sediment barriers straw waddles was of course a good good suggestion.

589
01:01:04,993 --> 01:01:06,494
[SPEAKER_11]: We always like to do that.

590
01:01:09,195 --> 01:01:19,741
[SPEAKER_09]: So we are the just for the board members to to understand we are kind of the special permit granting board for this project so it won't go anywhere else.

591
01:01:19,841 --> 01:01:20,541
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to um

592
01:01:22,972 --> 01:01:27,898
[SPEAKER_09]: we're in charge of approval of the project with conditions.

593
01:01:28,038 --> 01:01:38,730
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think just to summarize, I think what we've heard, there's some conditions that are in the fire chief's letter that the proponent has no objection to.

594
01:01:38,750 --> 01:01:39,411
[SPEAKER_09]: There is a,

595
01:01:42,192 --> 01:02:01,019
[SPEAKER_09]: some traffic mitigation measures, including re-striping for bicycles and pedestrians, looking at expanding bike parking and a kind of a speed reduction

596
01:02:01,799 --> 01:02:05,242
[SPEAKER_09]: signage, kind of feedback sign on Riverside Ave.

597
01:02:05,982 --> 01:02:07,783
[SPEAKER_09]: Am I missing any other conditions?

598
01:02:07,823 --> 01:02:12,287
[SPEAKER_11]: Andre, we've been jotting these down in a way that we could read them back to the board.

599
01:02:14,088 --> 01:02:14,448
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

600
01:02:14,668 --> 01:02:16,790
[SPEAKER_11]: That's perfect.

601
01:02:16,810 --> 01:02:27,057
[SPEAKER_11]: So the proponent's traffic mitigation proposal, in lieu of the ones proposed in the letter to the board from the traffic engineer,

602
01:02:27,785 --> 01:02:49,259
[SPEAKER_11]: are to install a westbound Riverside Ave speed feedback sign, which would be solar, install new speed limit 25 mile MPH sign on Riverside Ave, install bike lanes on the main parking lot drive aisle within the parking lot, repaint the do not block the box striping on Riverside Ave.

603
01:02:49,740 --> 01:02:51,100
[SPEAKER_11]: Those were the ones they proposed.

604
01:02:51,541 --> 01:02:56,164
[SPEAKER_11]: The other ones, and I'd like the proponent to confirm that these next two

605
01:02:56,840 --> 01:03:20,748
[SPEAKER_11]: we've captured appropriately for you, that they would, and I actually want to add this, review, and if possible, slide the diagonal parking spaces down and create a small area of bike racks at the end of the parking row, including protection for the bike area, such as guardrails or curbing.

606
01:03:20,768 --> 01:03:24,269
[SPEAKER_11]: Does that sound okay?

607
01:03:26,185 --> 01:03:36,817
[SPEAKER_10]: On John's, on the, excuse me, the tie and bond plan, it looks almost like it says seven, but I think there's 11 spaces there.

608
01:03:37,058 --> 01:03:44,647
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's this single lane of diagonal off the notch of the building, just to be clear.

609
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:52,843
[SPEAKER_11]: Partially, I want to capture these very accurately, because you get the permit, you do the work.

610
01:03:52,903 --> 01:03:58,566
[SPEAKER_11]: When you win the occupancy permit, someone from our office will take this list and say, did these things occur?

611
01:03:59,506 --> 01:04:06,589
[SPEAKER_11]: We want to make sure that we're going to be able to review them and get them.

612
01:04:08,235 --> 01:04:16,442
[SPEAKER_11]: And then property owner will revisit the opportunity to add sidewalks to the drive aisle in the future or potentially paint.

613
01:04:20,905 --> 01:04:26,870
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't capture the right word.

614
01:04:26,890 --> 01:04:28,672
[SPEAKER_11]: A pedestrian pathway?

615
01:04:29,713 --> 01:04:30,854
[SPEAKER_10]: A pedestrian pathway, yep.

616
01:04:38,011 --> 01:04:56,854
[SPEAKER_11]: So I guess for those two, rather than try to hold things up, if you as the owner find that you cannot do those things, then we would ask you to give us something in writing that shows this is the measurements, this is why we can't do those things.

617
01:04:57,740 --> 01:04:59,622
[SPEAKER_13]: Alicia if I if I could as well.

618
01:05:00,482 --> 01:05:06,027
[SPEAKER_13]: The engineers report had a restriction of $12,000 as a cap, and this project.

619
01:05:06,968 --> 01:05:12,532
[SPEAKER_13]: If they were resuiting this for retail space we wouldn't be going through the site plan special permit process.

620
01:05:12,952 --> 01:05:26,864
[SPEAKER_13]: So as part of this is they're also going to pay a linkage fee and that linkage fee is upwards of $40,000 so we really did appreciate that cap that was instituted because, you know, at some point, the project doesn't become feasible and that's

621
01:05:27,407 --> 01:05:30,008
[SPEAKER_13]: kind of an anchor to the bed.

622
01:05:30,028 --> 01:05:31,989
[SPEAKER_11]: At the beginning, there is a linkage fee.

623
01:05:32,689 --> 01:05:36,950
[SPEAKER_11]: And our tenant, this is a 20,000 square foot project, right?

624
01:05:37,291 --> 01:05:37,711
[SPEAKER_11]: Correct.

625
01:05:38,411 --> 01:05:46,314
[SPEAKER_11]: Our calculations was that the linkage fee was going to be on the order of 20,000 square feet, or $20,000.

626
01:05:47,094 --> 01:05:48,915
[SPEAKER_13]: That's better than what Kim thought it was gonna be.

627
01:05:49,575 --> 01:05:52,116
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I think it was a little bit more than 20,000.

628
01:05:52,276 --> 01:05:54,057
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought it was more like 34,000.

629
01:05:55,517 --> 01:06:10,712
[SPEAKER_11]: So the, so you have to actually, so I will, for the record, the link after the site plan review is completed, then the applicant needs to fill out the linkage program application for linkage fees.

630
01:06:11,292 --> 01:06:17,018
[SPEAKER_11]: And based on that is when the building commissioner will certify the amount of linkage.

631
01:06:17,475 --> 01:06:23,279
[SPEAKER_11]: However, it is an amount that is per 1,000 square feet of gross floor area.

632
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:28,924
[SPEAKER_11]: And the commercial number is, oh, Amanda, this sheet says 1,700.

633
01:06:30,265 --> 01:06:31,966
[SPEAKER_11]: Why were we using a number of 1,000 in our meeting this morning?

634
01:06:37,407 --> 01:06:38,608
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm maybe we were looking at.

635
01:06:38,728 --> 01:06:44,293
[SPEAKER_22]: There's like a separate fee for the non South Eastern part of Redford.

636
01:06:44,533 --> 01:06:52,259
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, so I did go back and I think it is closer to 34,000 34,000 because this is clearly in Southeastern Medford.

637
01:06:53,220 --> 01:06:53,440
[SPEAKER_11]: Right?

638
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:53,880
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

639
01:06:54,341 --> 01:06:54,561
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

640
01:06:56,542 --> 01:06:57,944
[SPEAKER_11]: And so you're sorry.

641
01:06:57,984 --> 01:07:03,108
[SPEAKER_11]: So 34,000 is approximately it's based on the exact square footage of the renovation.

642
01:07:05,515 --> 01:07:07,276
[SPEAKER_09]: building commissioner will finalize that.

643
01:07:07,336 --> 01:07:10,638
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't have, that's not something that the board needs to do.

644
01:07:10,678 --> 01:07:12,899
[SPEAKER_09]: This is just for informational purposes.

645
01:07:16,460 --> 01:07:21,763
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so Amanda, I'm assuming there are no further questions or comments from the public have come in.

646
01:07:22,924 --> 01:07:27,866
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so I'm gonna close, Ken just threw something into the chat.

647
01:07:28,617 --> 01:07:37,482
[SPEAKER_09]: Looking down the road, can these linkage funds be directed back into pedestrian access improvements to this plaza rather than just go into the overall linkage fund pool?

648
01:07:37,902 --> 01:07:39,743
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a question for you, Alicia, I think.

649
01:07:39,983 --> 01:07:48,808
[SPEAKER_11]: The problem is, so the linkage fund is for improvements on public facilities, and it is a privately owned property.

650
01:07:49,948 --> 01:07:54,811
[SPEAKER_11]: So one thing that I would reach out, I said offline, but,

651
01:07:55,951 --> 01:08:09,482
[SPEAKER_11]: through the economic development director, we're gonna reach out to the property owners to see if there is anything that the city can do when the program that Ken was referring to is a grant funded program.

652
01:08:09,962 --> 01:08:23,834
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I'm wondering if there, what the opportunities might be there to work with all three property owners as a city to see if there's an ability to get any grant to help with changing of the agreements

653
01:08:25,136 --> 01:08:27,438
[SPEAKER_11]: But I will reach out to them offline.

654
01:08:29,039 --> 01:08:32,641
[SPEAKER_11]: Legally, I do not believe that we can use linkage fees on private property.

655
01:08:32,661 --> 01:08:35,922
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, thank you.

656
01:08:37,183 --> 01:08:40,105
[SPEAKER_09]: Appreciate that effort, Alicia.

657
01:08:42,012 --> 01:08:52,900
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would like to close the public comment portion of the public hearing and open up to deliberation and motion by the board members.

658
01:08:53,220 --> 01:08:56,023
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further comments or discussion by board members?

659
01:09:01,587 --> 01:09:03,088
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a motion on the floor?

660
01:09:06,083 --> 01:09:22,740
[SPEAKER_09]: that would include the conditions in the letters by the fire department, the board of health and the lists that Alicia dictated to us.

661
01:09:23,541 --> 01:09:29,266
[SPEAKER_11]: So what I captured was in the engineering letter, except not the traffic recommendations.

662
01:09:30,778 --> 01:09:36,859
[SPEAKER_11]: So that would include like the straw waddles on that.

663
01:09:38,339 --> 01:09:45,661
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I think we also, I was actually gonna say, I think we need a motion to approve the waivers they requested.

664
01:09:47,361 --> 01:09:50,582
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not clear that we can just do that administratively.

665
01:09:50,602 --> 01:09:56,583

714
01:12:18,515 --> 01:12:28,960
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, the next item on the agenda is another public hearing, a proposed amendment to chapter 94 zoning to alter the membership structure of the Medford Zoning Board of Appeals.

715
01:12:29,980 --> 01:12:35,163
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me just, hold on a moment while I pull up that.

716
01:12:45,663 --> 01:12:54,487
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going to just say, Andre, as you're pulling up this, just for background for the board members, this is, in fact, the same thing you saw before.

717
01:12:54,507 --> 01:13:05,933
[SPEAKER_11]: There was a timing problem legally with the process before, and so it was re-referred to us by the city council.

718
01:13:06,333 --> 01:13:08,234
[SPEAKER_11]: There is nothing changed.

719
01:13:08,414 --> 01:13:10,536
[SPEAKER_11]: There is no changes in any of it.

720
01:13:10,576 --> 01:13:13,217
[SPEAKER_11]: It is simply the re-referral.

721
01:13:16,137 --> 01:13:24,759
[SPEAKER_09]: So the public hearing notice is the Medford Community Development Board shall conduct public hearing on Wednesday, July 21st, 2021, after 6.30 p.m.

722
01:13:24,779 --> 01:13:43,224

723
01:13:43,624 --> 01:13:52,655
[SPEAKER_09]: The full text of the amendment may be viewed in the office of the city clerk, City Hall Room 103, or on the city's website by clicking on current CD board filings.

724
01:13:53,336 --> 01:14:01,025
[SPEAKER_09]: We've already mentioned that pursuant to Chapter 20 of the Acts of 2021, this hearing of the Medford Community Development Board is conducted via remote meetings.

725
01:14:01,625 --> 01:14:03,868
[SPEAKER_09]: I would like to call this public hearing to order.

726
01:14:07,406 --> 01:14:13,769
[SPEAKER_09]: We just heard from our planning director, Alicia Hunt, that this is just a re-referral.

727
01:14:14,329 --> 01:14:18,471
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if Amanda, you wanted to add any details to that.

728
01:14:21,833 --> 01:14:22,733
[SPEAKER_22]: No new details.

729
01:14:23,153 --> 01:14:29,216
[SPEAKER_22]: I checked with the clerk's office today and yeah, it's just been resubmitted to the board for consideration.

730
01:14:29,236 --> 01:14:33,218
[SPEAKER_22]: And yeah, yep.

731
01:14:34,919 --> 01:14:35,239
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, go ahead.

732
01:14:37,295 --> 01:14:37,956
[SPEAKER_22]: Nope, that was it.

733
01:14:38,116 --> 01:14:40,821
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

734
01:14:40,861 --> 01:14:52,079
[SPEAKER_09]: So board members, this is something we've already deliberated on and voted on, but let me ask you whether you have any further comments or questions for discussion before I open it up to members of the public.

735
01:14:56,915 --> 01:15:02,036
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, hearing none, I would like to open the public participation portion of the hearing.

736
01:15:03,097 --> 01:15:21,862
[SPEAKER_09]: Any members of the public that would like to comment, please use the raise the hand function on your Zoom screen or to email or call the community development office, or if you can drop comments or questions in the Zoom chat as well.

737
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:27,963
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just going to give a moment for anybody to do that.

738
01:15:27,983 --> 01:15:43,377
[SPEAKER_09]: And for anybody who's listening remotely, I'll just remind you that the email address is ocd at medford-ma.gov.

739
01:15:43,958 --> 01:15:44,879
[SPEAKER_09]: And the phone number is 781-393-2480.

740
01:15:59,335 --> 01:16:04,718
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, seeing none, and Amanda, I assume no, you've gotten nothing?

741
01:16:05,218 --> 01:16:06,519
[SPEAKER_22]: No calls, no emails.

742
01:16:07,660 --> 01:16:08,220
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, great.

743
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:18,325
[SPEAKER_09]: Then I will close the public participation portion of the hearing and open it up for deliberation and motion by board members.

744
01:16:19,266 --> 01:16:22,788
[SPEAKER_17]: Andre, this is Jackie, Jackie Furtado, vice chair.

745
01:16:23,188 --> 01:16:26,290
[SPEAKER_17]: I just wanted to just reiterate really quickly that this is,

746
01:16:28,505 --> 01:16:34,351
[SPEAKER_17]: The current membership is obviously too small to represent the diversity of the city.

747
01:16:34,391 --> 01:16:35,833
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's why the mayor is calling for this.

748
01:16:35,893 --> 01:16:40,018
[SPEAKER_17]: It's also burdensome for the board members, only having three members, one alternate.

749
01:16:40,138 --> 01:16:46,665
[SPEAKER_17]: I make a motion to recommend it right back so that hopefully it can get done this time.

750
01:16:49,117 --> 01:16:49,778
[SPEAKER_09]: Great, thank you.

751
01:16:50,118 --> 01:16:54,863
[SPEAKER_09]: And let me just read this guy should have done this earlier but just to remind everyone that the letter.

752
01:16:55,584 --> 01:17:05,474
[SPEAKER_09]: This board sent to the city council included basically said board recommends that the council consider reincorporating language related to the staggering of terms.

753
01:17:05,930 --> 01:17:17,579
[SPEAKER_09]: that is present in the existing ordinance by inserting the following in the second sentence after the phrase term of three years, quote, which shall be staggered so that the terms of not more than two members expire annually.

754
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:23,584
[SPEAKER_09]: We had added that recommendation to the city council.

755
01:17:24,325 --> 01:17:28,728
[SPEAKER_09]: So if we make a motion, we may wanna consider including that language as well.

756
01:17:29,228 --> 01:17:33,452
[SPEAKER_09]: So Jackie, was that a formal motion you made?

757
01:17:34,202 --> 01:17:35,143
[SPEAKER_17]: It is a formal motion.

758
01:17:35,203 --> 01:17:38,744
[SPEAKER_17]: I just didn't have all the language, but I will do a motion to what you just said.

759
01:17:39,084 --> 01:17:40,265
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, great.

760
01:17:40,305 --> 01:17:47,169
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we will resend our exact same recommendation to the city council.

761
01:17:50,730 --> 01:17:51,511
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, this is David.

762
01:17:51,971 --> 01:17:56,993
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to second that motion to resubmit our exact same recommendations as the last time.

763
01:17:57,034 --> 01:17:57,454
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.

764
01:17:58,174 --> 01:17:58,354

01:18:39,306 --> 01:18:39,506
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

883
01:18:39,546 --> 01:18:41,288
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much, Director Hunt.

884
01:18:45,892 --> 01:18:45,972
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh,

885
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:56,885
[SPEAKER_09]: The next item on the agenda is a site plan review recommendation to the Board of Appeals for 200 Boston Avenue.

886
01:18:57,645 --> 01:19:16,754
[SPEAKER_09]: And just a reminder that since the ZBA is the special permit granting authority for this project, our role is site plan review and making a set of recommendations to the ZBA for their consideration as they approve or debate the project.

887
01:19:19,715 --> 01:19:20,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Andre, this is David.

888
01:19:20,555 --> 01:19:24,677
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, David, let me just read the public hearing notice.

889
01:19:24,877 --> 01:19:25,977
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on one moment.

890
01:19:36,901 --> 01:19:39,122
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, everyone, as I toggle all my windows.

891
01:19:41,700 --> 01:19:42,781
[SPEAKER_09]: Courtesy meeting notice.

892
01:19:42,801 --> 01:19:48,226
[SPEAKER_09]: The Medford Community Development Board shall conduct a meeting on July 21st, 2021 after 6 p.m.

893
01:19:48,246 --> 01:20:06,401
[SPEAKER_09]: via Zoom remote video conferencing relative to an application for site plan review submitted by Simmons Properties LLC and represented by Cummings Properties to construct a three-story addition to an existing structure at 200 Boston Avenue to be used as a research and testing laboratory facility.

894
01:20:06,861 --> 01:20:09,684
[SPEAKER_09]: This is an allowed use in an industrial zoning district.

895
01:20:10,064 --> 01:20:21,371
[SPEAKER_09]: The project is subject to a site plan review special permit as per the city of Medford zoning ordinance, chapter 94, section 94-331, and requires approvals from the board of appeals.

896
01:20:21,811 --> 01:20:32,158
[SPEAKER_09]: Therefore, the community development board will perform a site review and submit its recommendations to the zoning board who will be the special permit granting authority for the site plan review special permit.

897
01:20:32,612 --> 01:20:43,159
[SPEAKER_09]: Plans for this project may be viewed in the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability, City Hall room 308 or on the city's website by clicking on current CD board filings.

898
01:20:44,020 --> 01:20:56,969
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, if you members of the public would like to submit comments or questions via email, the email address is ocd at medford-ma.gov or via phone to 781-393-2480.

899
01:21:01,932 --> 01:21:02,332
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

900
01:21:02,713 --> 01:21:03,393
[SPEAKER_09]: David Blumberg.

901
01:21:05,734 --> 01:21:06,335
[SPEAKER_03]: Andre, thank you.

902
01:21:06,355 --> 01:21:07,315
[SPEAKER_03]: This is David.

903
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:14,760
[SPEAKER_03]: I will have to recuse myself from this matter as the applicant is my employer presenting an obvious conflict.

904
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:22,165
[SPEAKER_03]: So I will go ahead and mute myself and suppress my video and not participate on this one.

905
01:21:23,826 --> 01:21:24,026
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

906
01:21:24,126 --> 01:21:25,687
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much, David.

907
01:21:28,644 --> 01:21:36,633
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me invite the project proponent to give a presentation about what we're looking at.

908
01:21:36,653 --> 01:21:45,001
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we have Mike Avini from senior project architect with Cummins properties.

909
01:21:45,081 --> 01:21:45,482
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that right?

910
01:21:46,460 --> 01:21:47,100
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, correct.

911
01:21:47,140 --> 01:21:47,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.

912
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:54,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you to Community Development Board for having us in the public members of the public for joining us this evening.

913
01:21:55,442 --> 01:21:56,542
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Michael Avani.

914
01:21:56,582 --> 01:21:59,222
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a senior project architect with Cummings Properties.

915
01:22:00,042 --> 01:22:04,043
[SPEAKER_04]: With me this evening on this call is Brian Murray.

916
01:22:04,263 --> 01:22:06,463
[SPEAKER_04]: He is a project engineer here at Cummings Properties.

917
01:22:07,264 --> 01:22:15,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Dennis Clark, chairman and CEO of Cummings Properties and our traffic consultant, Rodney Emery of World Tech Engineering.

918
01:22:16,292 --> 01:22:25,299
[SPEAKER_04]: We are here this evening seeking a recommendation from the Community Development Board to construct an addition to the existing building at 200 Boston Ave.

919
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:42,453
[SPEAKER_04]: More specifically, as the chair stated earlier, and as stated by the building commissioner, Paul Mulkey, in his permit refusal letter dated June 3rd, 2021, the project requires a zoning, a finding by the Zoning Board of Appeals.

920
01:22:43,383 --> 01:22:49,385
[SPEAKER_04]: In this case, the Community Development Board conducts site plan review and provides a recommendation to the Zoning Board of Appeals.

921
01:22:51,846 --> 01:22:53,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Brief summary of the project.

922
01:22:54,308 --> 01:23:09,674
[SPEAKER_04]: Consistent with the recommendation of the February 2012 Metropolitan Area Planning Council study to evaluate the benefits and the impacts of the Green Line extension, the applicant proposes to redevelop an existing civic level parking structure,

923
01:23:10,568 --> 01:23:27,617
[SPEAKER_04]: into a five-story structure consisting of approximately 67,000 gross square feet of mixed-use research and testing facility, life sciences as well, including an additional 133 structured parking spaces.

924
01:23:29,558 --> 01:23:38,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Up to approximately 6,100 gross square feet on the ground level could be purposed as a commercial retail amenity space.

925
01:23:40,782 --> 01:23:44,044
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to share a brief recap of how we got to this evening.

926
01:23:45,045 --> 01:23:55,871
[SPEAKER_04]: In December of 2020, Dennis Clark, the chairman and CEO of Cummings Properties, myself, and one of our tenants in 200 Boston Ave, met with the mayor and the mayor's chief of staff to introduce the project.

927
01:23:57,357 --> 01:24:26,148
[SPEAKER_04]: With the support of the mayor's office, in January of 2021, we participated in a virtual meeting to introduce the project to several Medford city officials, including Alicia Hunt, the director of planning, Victor Schrader, the director of the economic development director, building commissioner, Paul Mulkey, director of traffic and transportation, Todd Blake, chief Buckley of Medford police department,

928
01:24:26,843 --> 01:24:32,445
[SPEAKER_04]: chief Gilberti of the Medford Fire Department, and Medford City engineer, Tim McGibbon.

929
01:24:34,465 --> 01:24:45,668
[SPEAKER_04]: With the support of, and the coordination by the mayor's office, in April of 2021, we participated in a virtual community outreach meeting, introducing the project to the neighborhood.

930
01:24:46,408 --> 01:24:56,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, we took all the things, the input that we got from the December meeting, kind of rolled it into a package that we shared with the community in April.

931
01:24:57,120 --> 01:24:59,842
[SPEAKER_04]: In May, we submitted a building permit application for the project.

932
01:25:00,762 --> 01:25:03,984
[SPEAKER_04]: In June, we submitted a site plan review application.

933
01:25:05,245 --> 01:25:06,225
[SPEAKER_04]: That brings us to today.

934
01:25:08,066 --> 01:25:17,252
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I'd like to share with you is a presentation that is a combination of all the information that we've gathered and picked up over the last six months based on the various meetings that we've had.

935
01:25:19,914 --> 01:25:26,838
[SPEAKER_04]: and to share with you some, the municipal approval package that we submitted and go through that piece by piece.

936
01:25:27,818 --> 01:25:33,101
[SPEAKER_04]: The first thing I'd like to do though, is if Amanda, you would allow me to share the screen.

937
01:25:33,121 --> 01:25:35,502
[SPEAKER_22]: You should be all set.

938
01:25:36,082 --> 01:25:37,263
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, screen one.

939
01:25:37,283 --> 01:25:42,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, can I share screen one, share?

940
01:25:42,045 --> 01:25:46,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Bear with me one second, I'm just, see if we can get this right.

941
01:25:46,908 --> 01:25:48,729
[SPEAKER_04]: So we wanna share the sound.

942
01:25:49,828 --> 01:25:51,169
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to optimize this video.

943
01:25:51,849 --> 01:26:02,694
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to share with you a video that kind of gives you a flavor of what the project is all about.

944
01:26:02,734 --> 01:26:04,374
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a short two minute rendering.

945
01:26:04,394 --> 01:26:07,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Bear with me one second.

946
01:28:17,981 --> 01:28:18,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody still there?

947
01:28:19,943 --> 01:28:20,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

948
01:28:20,863 --> 01:28:21,944
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for sharing that.

949
01:28:21,964 --> 01:28:24,145
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what's going on.

950
01:28:24,185 --> 01:28:26,227
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't for some reason, I've lost everybody.

951
01:28:26,407 --> 01:28:28,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me just get back here.

952
01:28:28,708 --> 01:28:33,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so I will, if you bear with me one second, let me go one step back here.

953
01:28:33,732 --> 01:28:35,333
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd like to kind of

954
01:28:36,359 --> 01:28:37,240
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wrong one.

955
01:28:37,540 --> 01:28:37,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

956
01:28:38,941 --> 01:28:39,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

957
01:28:39,942 --> 01:28:41,363
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys can't really see that either.

958
01:28:42,724 --> 01:28:43,145
[SPEAKER_04]: This one.

959
01:28:43,165 --> 01:28:48,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, as I said before, old guy with technology here.

960
01:28:48,309 --> 01:28:51,231
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll just move this over.

961
01:28:51,251 --> 01:29:01,560
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I'd like to do is run through some of the pieces that were submitted

962
01:29:05,622 --> 01:29:09,245
[SPEAKER_04]: as part of the municipal approval submission documents.

963
01:29:09,585 --> 01:29:10,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody see what I have on my screen?

964
01:29:12,908 --> 01:29:13,068
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

965
01:29:13,809 --> 01:29:14,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Fantastic.

966
01:29:15,931 --> 01:29:20,334
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, this is the proposed addition to the building at 200 Boston Ave.

967
01:29:21,695 --> 01:29:26,940
[SPEAKER_04]: The view you're looking at here is the northern elevation of the building looking south.

968
01:29:33,745 --> 01:29:34,045
[SPEAKER_04]: This is

969
01:29:35,145 --> 01:29:37,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, an illustration taken from that video.

970
01:29:37,368 --> 01:29:47,238
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of these slides are similar to what was on the video here, but this is our vision of the project looking north up Boston Ave.

971
01:29:47,859 --> 01:29:50,081
[SPEAKER_04]: The garage is in the foreground.

972
01:29:50,101 --> 01:29:55,267
[SPEAKER_04]: The proposed three-story leaseable building is kind of further south.

973
01:29:58,748 --> 01:30:03,953
[SPEAKER_04]: This is our vision, again, the north elevation of this project looking south.

974
01:30:04,433 --> 01:30:14,403
[SPEAKER_04]: In the background there, you can see the elevated pedestrian walkway that will connect the two structures, making them kind of one.

975
01:30:17,618 --> 01:30:39,591
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the first slide in the submission package that we submitted to the Community Development Board and subsequently the Zoning Board of Appeals, showing some of the existing conditions, an existing looking south, an existing looking east, photo looking east from across Boston Ave at the existing single level parking structure that's there now.

976
01:30:40,492 --> 01:30:41,972
[SPEAKER_04]: This photo here is looking north.

977
01:30:43,013 --> 01:30:46,174
[SPEAKER_04]: down Boston Ave, kind of a locus plan of where it is.

978
01:30:46,234 --> 01:30:47,514
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's small, but there it is.

979
01:30:48,054 --> 01:30:58,036
[SPEAKER_04]: This is an overhead of the existing site as it exists today, the parking structure that you enter from here and kind of go around here at the upper level.

980
01:30:58,056 --> 01:31:07,618
[SPEAKER_04]: And then again, just to kind of a footprint of the proposed in red here is the footprint of the proposed development redevelopment.

981
01:31:09,479 --> 01:31:11,319
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, title sheet to that package.

982
01:31:13,383 --> 01:31:15,604
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, this is an existing condition site plan.

983
01:31:16,864 --> 01:31:24,547
[SPEAKER_04]: The yellow line indicates the extent of the existing garage that looks to be repurposed.

984
01:31:26,907 --> 01:31:33,490
[SPEAKER_04]: This slide here shows basically what the proposed structure would look like.

985
01:31:33,550 --> 01:31:40,952
[SPEAKER_04]: As you can see in pink here, we've eliminated a section of the upper deck of the garage so that when

986
01:31:41,647 --> 01:31:46,248
[SPEAKER_04]: You come in here and turn around and kind of go around that piece.

987
01:31:46,268 --> 01:31:48,689
[SPEAKER_04]: We needed a flat piece here to kind of make the transition.

988
01:31:48,729 --> 01:31:51,169
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're actually removing a section of the garage.

989
01:31:54,670 --> 01:31:56,590
[SPEAKER_04]: We get a little bit into the utility plans.

990
01:31:57,470 --> 01:32:09,773
[SPEAKER_04]: We met today, earlier today with Peter Kerger of the water department, water and sewer department to kind of hash out some of the water and sewer details that showed up

991
01:32:11,703 --> 01:32:15,966
[SPEAKER_04]: in the engineering department's comment letters.

992
01:32:17,727 --> 01:32:20,009
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything should be able to be served from the site.

993
01:32:20,469 --> 01:32:22,450
[SPEAKER_04]: There's water and sewer capacity.

994
01:32:22,491 --> 01:32:31,917
[SPEAKER_04]: We did calculations up here on the top left-hand corner to talk about water consumption and sewer, anticipated sewer discharge.

995
01:32:32,637 --> 01:32:37,681
[SPEAKER_04]: And based on our meeting, it seems that we have the capacities on site to accommodate all that stuff.

996
01:32:40,108 --> 01:32:44,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we have gas and electric and communications plans.

997
01:32:45,231 --> 01:32:52,636
[SPEAKER_04]: We are actively working with National Grid, who controls both the electric and the gas services here.

998
01:32:53,237 --> 01:33:05,525
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got confirmation that there's plenty of electric in the neighborhood to pick up the need for this, what's gonna, the electrical service requirement for the proposed structure.

999
01:33:07,383 --> 01:33:15,749
[SPEAKER_04]: The gas, there is a high pressure gas that runs through the site that also should, it's been confirmed that there's more than enough.

1000
01:33:16,830 --> 01:33:25,517
[SPEAKER_04]: We're still working with the gas company to determine the actual load that it will require, but they're comfortable that we should be able to get all that information.

1001
01:33:26,117 --> 01:33:30,221
[SPEAKER_04]: We should be able to get all that service right from utilities on site.

1002
01:33:30,241 --> 01:33:35,485
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're hoping not to go off site for any of those utilities.

1003
01:33:37,603 --> 01:33:38,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Grading and drainage plan.

1004
01:33:40,263 --> 01:33:42,784
[SPEAKER_04]: We have an interesting site.

1005
01:33:42,864 --> 01:33:46,905
[SPEAKER_04]: It's 100% developed as everybody here sure knows.

1006
01:33:48,125 --> 01:34:02,987
[SPEAKER_04]: And we had spoken with the city engineer, Tim McGivern, regarding how we kind of make the, it's a redevelopment project and how we make some improvements here.

1007
01:34:03,348 --> 01:34:05,348
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a slight reduction

1008
01:34:06,515 --> 01:34:13,159
[SPEAKER_04]: in impervious area that helps contribute to the stormwater management here.

1009
01:34:14,779 --> 01:34:22,744
[SPEAKER_04]: It also works out that currently the upper deck of the parking is exposed.

1010
01:34:24,112 --> 01:34:39,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Storm cars drive in here they could have discharges oil, whatever could run off of an automobile winds up in the stormwater system it goes to an oil water sand separator, and then goes into the system by putting the roof on the structure.

1011
01:34:41,012 --> 01:34:43,214
[SPEAKER_04]: so that all the parking becomes structured.

1012
01:34:43,835 --> 01:34:47,978
[SPEAKER_04]: It helps actually in the quality of the stormwater discharge.

1013
01:34:48,359 --> 01:34:50,500
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's also an improvement to the site.

1014
01:34:51,221 --> 01:34:54,124
[SPEAKER_04]: We also, consistent with the

1015
01:34:56,335 --> 01:34:58,756
[SPEAKER_04]: engineering department's comment letter.

1016
01:34:59,537 --> 01:35:11,444
[SPEAKER_04]: We agreed, and we've done this in many places in the past, and many of our managed properties will try to preserve as much of the stormwater as we can into a cistern so we can use it to water plants and such.

1017
01:35:11,564 --> 01:35:15,987
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've done that successfully in other places, and we hope to do that here as well.

1018
01:35:18,449 --> 01:35:19,470
[SPEAKER_04]: landscaping plan.

1019
01:35:19,510 --> 01:35:22,772
[SPEAKER_04]: We again, it is a pretty tight site.

1020
01:35:22,832 --> 01:35:27,955
[SPEAKER_04]: There is some landscaping along the existing 200 Boston Ave building that will be preserved.

1021
01:35:28,776 --> 01:35:38,962
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll probably have to do a little work here in the landscaping area that's in front of the garage structure between the garage and the sidewalk.

1022
01:35:39,042 --> 01:35:43,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, obviously that'll be a work area as we erect this structure.

1023
01:35:44,105 --> 01:35:47,628
[SPEAKER_04]: So some of that will be displaced and replanted.

1024
01:35:50,011 --> 01:35:56,076
[SPEAKER_04]: As I talked about earlier, this will be down here in this area here is potential amenity space.

1025
01:35:56,476 --> 01:36:04,984
[SPEAKER_04]: So we hope to have some plaza area here, some outdoor space to kind of engage that amenity space here.

1026
01:36:05,004 --> 01:36:10,209
[SPEAKER_04]: So that'll be incorporated some benches and some stairways and ramps as well.

1027
01:36:12,920 --> 01:36:17,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, to sort of reinforce that this is just a floor of ground level floor plan.

1028
01:36:19,784 --> 01:36:20,585
[SPEAKER_04]: Of the proposal.

1029
01:36:21,646 --> 01:36:28,410
[SPEAKER_04]: In the pink here is the area that will be that we're proposing to potentially be an amenity space.

1030
01:36:31,272 --> 01:36:38,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now we certainly don't have any tenants lined up for that we're happy to accept any referrals if you'd like to.

1031
01:36:39,958 --> 01:36:45,500
[SPEAKER_04]: help us out and find a nice local coffee shop that would like to take that space would be more than open to that.

1032
01:36:47,601 --> 01:37:01,347
[SPEAKER_04]: But all the rest of the ground level will be remain parking upper level the second floor, this ramp that's here now will remain, you'll get up to the second level of parking, and then transition up to the

1033
01:37:02,442 --> 01:37:11,807
[SPEAKER_04]: upper levels of parking in this clockwise manner, and the rest of the second level of parking will remain as it exists today, but now it will be covered.

1034
01:37:11,827 --> 01:37:17,450
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get up to the upper levels the third, fourth and fifth levels.

1035
01:37:18,470 --> 01:37:19,171
[SPEAKER_04]: These will be the

1036
01:37:20,253 --> 01:37:24,336
[SPEAKER_04]: proposed leaseable spaces here in blue and then beige will be the parking.

1037
01:37:24,356 --> 01:37:29,479
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, it's a single ramp helix system.

1038
01:37:30,059 --> 01:37:31,740
[SPEAKER_04]: So there is ramps on both sides.

1039
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:42,507
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the comments made with the historical commission letter was if we could flip it so the ramp was on the interior side of the

1040
01:37:43,802 --> 01:37:51,668
[SPEAKER_04]: of the project, but because of the tightness of the site and to be able to continue to park on the ramps, we needed each bit of run.

1041
01:37:51,688 --> 01:37:53,830
[SPEAKER_04]: As you can see, there's only a bit of flat spot here.

1042
01:37:54,270 --> 01:37:55,632
[SPEAKER_04]: These ramps just keep going up.

1043
01:37:55,652 --> 01:38:06,120
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's very, very challenging to potentially flip that in this footprint to accommodate that comment.

1044
01:38:09,503 --> 01:38:10,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, we're looking at

1045
01:38:13,783 --> 01:38:17,805
[SPEAKER_04]: documents that were submitted as part of the municipal submission approval process.

1046
01:38:18,865 --> 01:38:27,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Conceptual building sections, parking, as you can see, ramps, flat spot, like we talked about, three levels of leaseable space, amenity space at the ground.

1047
01:38:31,391 --> 01:38:35,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Just other cross sections of the garage in the leaseable space.

1048
01:38:36,233 --> 01:38:40,595
[SPEAKER_04]: This would be the three level elevated pedestrian walkway here that connects the buildings.

1049
01:38:43,483 --> 01:38:50,529
[SPEAKER_04]: The roof of the structure, we would reserve this part of the roof for mechanical equipment.

1050
01:38:53,912 --> 01:39:04,102
[SPEAKER_04]: And this part of the garage section of the roof that's not likely to have any need for mechanical equipment will be reserved for future solar arrays.

1051
01:39:05,763 --> 01:39:08,606
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be built solar ready as the code building code requires.

1052
01:39:12,623 --> 01:39:13,884
[SPEAKER_04]: These are some building elevations.

1053
01:39:13,924 --> 01:39:15,966
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, it might be a little redundant.

1054
01:39:16,146 --> 01:39:20,391
[SPEAKER_04]: The video was derived after we put this package together.

1055
01:39:21,952 --> 01:39:25,475
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, these talk about some of the materials that we're using.

1056
01:39:26,116 --> 01:39:31,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Our goal is very much to match the vernacular of the existing building using modern materials.

1057
01:39:31,481 --> 01:39:33,463
[SPEAKER_04]: This upper elevation here is

1058
01:39:35,404 --> 01:39:39,388
[SPEAKER_04]: the north elevation, so you're looking south, existing building here to the left.

1059
01:39:40,089 --> 01:39:44,733
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an old concrete mill building, all precast concrete with some brick infill.

1060
01:39:46,475 --> 01:39:51,880
[SPEAKER_04]: And we carried some of the same components into this, but just modernized materials.

1061
01:39:53,662 --> 01:39:56,986
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the Boston Ave, here in the middle is the Boston Ave elevation.

1062
01:39:58,782 --> 01:40:08,248
[SPEAKER_04]: What's interesting about this is one of the comments again in the historical commission letter was separating kind of the building from the parking structure.

1063
01:40:08,788 --> 01:40:16,552
[SPEAKER_04]: And while it's very challenging to do that by recessing a section of it, and it kind of complicates the parking.

1064
01:40:17,713 --> 01:40:21,035
[SPEAKER_04]: We did achieve a visual disconnect here by

1065
01:40:23,771 --> 01:40:25,753
[SPEAKER_04]: providing a different material in between.

1066
01:40:25,813 --> 01:40:31,817
[SPEAKER_04]: So this will be all kind of screening and we'll have a different screening in the middle to kind of separate the two.

1067
01:40:31,877 --> 01:40:37,101
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think we accomplished the same objective here.

1068
01:40:39,283 --> 01:40:45,528
[SPEAKER_04]: We just did it with materials as opposed to trying to change the shape of the building.

1069
01:40:45,628 --> 01:40:47,429
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, tough site, tough to do.

1070
01:40:50,113 --> 01:40:55,618
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's an isometric of kind of the site, a little, again, all developed before the video.

1071
01:40:55,638 --> 01:41:02,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully the video told a good amount of the story, but just addresses on some of the materials that we're going to use to kind of make this happen.

1072
01:41:07,229 --> 01:41:11,192
[SPEAKER_04]: So the interesting part of this project is the phasing.

1073
01:41:11,472 --> 01:41:12,794
[SPEAKER_04]: And as you're aware,

1074
01:41:15,665 --> 01:41:25,271
[SPEAKER_04]: We would like to, obviously we need to keep this fully occupied 200 Boston Ave building, exactly that, occupied and operational.

1075
01:41:26,031 --> 01:41:32,094
[SPEAKER_04]: So as you can see here on the top left corner, existing condition plan now, parking deck building, shows the relationships.

1076
01:41:32,935 --> 01:41:41,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Phase one, we'd like to be able to construct the parking structure first and then occupy the parking structure.

1077
01:41:42,999 --> 01:41:46,362
[SPEAKER_04]: and then phase two, we would go in and build the building.

1078
01:41:47,723 --> 01:41:49,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Quick run back to phase one.

1079
01:41:53,489 --> 01:41:59,334
[SPEAKER_04]: The challenge with that is we need to be able to get to this upper level of parking while this is being happening.

1080
01:41:59,374 --> 01:42:07,922
[SPEAKER_04]: The ramp to get here, as you can see, is on the south side of the site, and it heads north and gives you access to the upper level parking deck.

1081
01:42:09,625 --> 01:42:10,605
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a lot of options.

1082
01:42:10,645 --> 01:42:12,466
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't really nailed it down yet.

1083
01:42:12,586 --> 01:42:20,588
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing we thought is if we could access it from Boston Ave with a temporary ramp while we're doing this so that we could still utilize the parking, that would be one way to look at it.

1084
01:42:21,589 --> 01:42:31,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Even today, we talked about maybe we could do a ramp here on the north side of the existing garage to accommodate the same thing, depending on the run that we need.

1085
01:42:32,012 --> 01:42:37,594
[SPEAKER_04]: So these are some of the logistics that we're gonna have to work out still.

1086
01:42:39,465 --> 01:42:55,435
[SPEAKER_04]: We fully expect that there are going to be some asks here and some of the some of the challenges are, you know, maybe we'll need some cooperation with the city to block off the sidewalk for a little bit while we're doing some work here, or we're looking at off site parking accommodations as well.

1087
01:42:57,182 --> 01:42:57,562
[SPEAKER_04]: challenging.

1088
01:42:57,602 --> 01:42:58,402
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an urban site.

1089
01:42:58,842 --> 01:43:00,363
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty tight.

1090
01:43:00,823 --> 01:43:14,747
[SPEAKER_04]: We've developed some lay down area strategies already for offsite stuff to get material here, but some of the onsite logistics will be worked out and we'll hopefully, like I said, we'll work with the city to make that happen.

1091
01:43:15,287 --> 01:43:19,988
[SPEAKER_04]: And ultimately, the complete building, this is what it looks like when it's all put together.

1092
01:43:22,568 --> 01:43:28,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, this was an aerial view of how it all would look when it's completed.

1093
01:43:28,515 --> 01:43:33,841
[SPEAKER_04]: I could probably zoom in a little more here, get in a little closer.

1094
01:43:33,861 --> 01:43:38,627
[SPEAKER_04]: It kind of fits right in there nicely with the existing building and the existing surroundings.

1095
01:43:49,795 --> 01:44:05,680
[SPEAKER_04]: These are all these were all just the all these renderings here again very similar to what we showed in the video and showed at the beginning so I'm just going to kind of breeze through these because these these were all included in the in the municipal submission approval package just kind of duplicate themselves.

1096
01:44:07,901 --> 01:44:15,727
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing we were asked to look at in one of the meetings was some of the shadow studies, how would this building impact the neighbors.

1097
01:44:16,488 --> 01:44:22,993
[SPEAKER_04]: And there is definitely in the winter solstice as we all know that's when we get the longest shadows.

1098
01:44:24,274 --> 01:44:32,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Interestingly enough, there'll be some morning in the morning we might get some at the peak winter solstice we make it some offsite shadows to the north.

1099
01:44:34,895 --> 01:44:35,515
[SPEAKER_04]: in the morning.

1100
01:44:35,755 --> 01:44:37,576
[SPEAKER_04]: In the afternoon, those are reversed.

1101
01:44:38,336 --> 01:44:42,438
[SPEAKER_04]: The houses across the street cast the shadows on the building.

1102
01:44:43,458 --> 01:44:48,900
[SPEAKER_04]: That was really the only time that there was any significant challenges here.

1103
01:44:49,020 --> 01:45:01,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, two times a day, it becomes, as the day wears on, the shadows recede, and it should not be a significant hardship, I don't expect.

1104
01:45:03,373 --> 01:45:15,424
[SPEAKER_04]: And with that, I will turn this over briefly to my colleague Brian Murray, who will talk about public transportation and parking on the site.

1105
01:45:16,883 --> 01:45:20,764
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening Mr. Chair, members of the board, Brian Murray Cummings Properties.

1106
01:45:22,065 --> 01:45:27,407
[SPEAKER_01]: The proposed addition is very well situated to facilitate multimodal transportation.

1107
01:45:28,047 --> 01:45:31,628
[SPEAKER_01]: With respect to public transport bus routes, 80 and 94.

1108
01:45:31,728 --> 01:45:36,690
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike I think you have to, can you please share your screen Mike.

1109
01:45:36,950 --> 01:45:41,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sorry about that I thought if I shared I stopped sharing my screen I would get back to.

1110
01:45:42,493 --> 01:45:43,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry about that, everybody.

1111
01:45:43,653 --> 01:45:44,314
[SPEAKER_01]: That's okay.

1112
01:45:45,034 --> 01:45:47,275
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll continue with the narrative.

1113
01:45:47,375 --> 01:45:54,977
[SPEAKER_01]: So bus routes 80 and 94 serve the proposed addition on Boston Ave.

1114
01:45:55,797 --> 01:46:01,859
[SPEAKER_01]: And in addition, there is bus route 96, which is within a half a mile of the proposal.

1115
01:46:02,580 --> 01:46:09,702
[SPEAKER_01]: These routes connect the building to cities and towns of Arlington, Medford, Cambridge and Somerville.

1116
01:46:10,945 --> 01:46:17,648
[SPEAKER_01]: and in particular, they provide connections to mass transit.

1117
01:46:18,668 --> 01:46:34,195
[SPEAKER_01]: Davis Square Red Line T station is reached by bus routes 94 and 96, and to the north, the commuter rail station West Medford is accessed by bus as well.

1118
01:46:35,235 --> 01:47:00,547
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, another point to note is that in the MPO tip program for fiscal years 2022 to 2026 blue bike expansion has been approved, which would fund the creation of a blue bike dock on Winthrop Street and Boston Avenue, which is within a third of a mile from the proposed addition.

1119
01:47:02,609 --> 01:47:06,836
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, I'll need your assistance to... Great.

1120
01:47:07,097 --> 01:47:08,399
[SPEAKER_01]: Move to the next slide, please.

1121
01:47:12,622 --> 01:47:12,942
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1122
01:47:14,443 --> 01:47:16,763
[SPEAKER_01]: On this slide, I'd like to discuss parking.

1123
01:47:17,344 --> 01:47:26,207
[SPEAKER_01]: These two images are satellite images taken pre-pandemic in 2017 and 2018 during a weekday.

1124
01:47:26,927 --> 01:47:32,569
[SPEAKER_01]: In the existing condition, the site has 361 spaces.

1125
01:47:34,049 --> 01:47:42,232
[SPEAKER_01]: The site is occupied typically by the UCIS office and light research and laboratory.

1126
01:47:43,658 --> 01:47:51,782
[SPEAKER_01]: The number of parking spaces in the existing condition is one per 658 gross square feet.

1127
01:47:53,183 --> 01:48:01,268
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can see from the satellite imagery, there is ample parking spaces to serve the needs of the occupants of the building.

1128
01:48:01,708 --> 01:48:04,629
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll elaborate on that point a little further in a moment.

1129
01:48:06,970 --> 01:48:12,945
[SPEAKER_01]: the final condition, um, pending completion of the proposed addition.

1130
01:48:13,996 --> 01:48:17,377
[SPEAKER_01]: What we plan to do is to maintain that same ratio of parking.

1131
01:48:17,837 --> 01:48:22,898
[SPEAKER_01]: In the existing condition, it's one space per 658 gross square feet.

1132
01:48:23,718 --> 01:48:32,060
[SPEAKER_01]: In the final condition, it's a slight improvement at one parking space per 671 gross square feet.

1133
01:48:33,241 --> 01:48:35,201
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to add an anecdote here.

1134
01:48:35,681 --> 01:48:43,243
[SPEAKER_01]: For the benefit of the city, who we understand are in consultation to consider recodifying zoning ordinance.

1135
01:48:44,083 --> 01:48:59,090
[SPEAKER_01]: In that, looking at the satellite images, we've ascertained that the actual demand for parking spaces for this building, which is predominantly serving life sciences, is on average one per 1,000 gross square feet.

1136
01:48:59,330 --> 01:49:06,774
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's in line with what the city and their consultants are thinking to codify for this type of use in the Office 2 district.

1137
01:49:06,814 --> 01:49:09,676
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a data point to share for your benefit.

1138
01:49:10,936 --> 01:49:13,438
[SPEAKER_01]: and Mike, if you could please move on to the next slide.

1139
01:49:14,799 --> 01:49:25,228
[SPEAKER_01]: One additional point we'd like to make with respect to multimodal transportation is the ability to bike to commute to the property.

1140
01:49:25,928 --> 01:49:29,651
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an image of the bike racks which are existing on site.

1141
01:49:29,692 --> 01:49:39,179
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very well utilized and we'd like to continue to support biking as a mode of transportation to the proposed addition and will provide

1142
01:49:40,200 --> 01:49:44,741
[SPEAKER_01]: bicycle racks in proportion to the building square footage.

1143
01:49:46,362 --> 01:49:53,844
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that covers the key points that I wish to make on transportation and parking, and I'll hand back to Mike.

1144
01:49:54,564 --> 01:49:55,024
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Mike.

1145
01:49:55,584 --> 01:49:56,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Brian.

1146
01:49:56,165 --> 01:50:03,047
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want to share a couple quick last little bits here before we can open it up to questions.

1147
01:50:04,647 --> 01:50:06,027
[SPEAKER_04]: This is 196 Boston Ave.

1148
01:50:09,479 --> 01:50:10,139
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a nice picture.

1149
01:50:10,720 --> 01:50:14,461
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the facade facing the train tracks.

1150
01:50:14,901 --> 01:50:19,904
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what it looked like before Cummings Properties got involved with it.

1151
01:50:20,344 --> 01:50:38,352
[SPEAKER_04]: And we all know what it looks like today, but this is just one of these fun things that I feel like anybody in Medford who's a lifelong resident or has been there for a long time would kind of recognize this and hopefully appreciate what's going on in this two building campus for the last 30 years.

1152
01:50:40,532 --> 01:50:42,433
[SPEAKER_04]: And with that, we've talked a bit.

1153
01:50:42,973 --> 01:50:45,193
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm happy to open this up to questions.

1154
01:50:45,213 --> 01:50:50,295
[SPEAKER_04]: I know there's a lot of things that we all want to talk about, so we're happy to entertain any questions.

1155
01:50:50,315 --> 01:50:54,156
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, thank you, Mike.

1156
01:50:55,476 --> 01:50:59,037
[SPEAKER_09]: If you can stop sharing your screen, that'd be great.

1157
01:50:59,077 --> 01:50:59,517
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1158
01:51:00,037 --> 01:51:04,759
[SPEAKER_09]: And let me open it up to board members for questions and comments.

1159
01:51:06,639 --> 01:51:06,939
[SPEAKER_09]: Klaus?

1160
01:51:08,680 --> 01:51:08,720
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi.

1161
01:51:12,027 --> 01:51:19,873
[SPEAKER_18]: I apologize if you were clear on this question, but is this a new building or a renovation to a building?

1162
01:51:21,354 --> 01:51:23,095
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in addition to the existing building.

1163
01:51:23,115 --> 01:51:27,258
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how we're looking to... Which existing building?

1164
01:51:27,938 --> 01:51:35,204
[SPEAKER_04]: The 200 Boston Ave building, the one in back of it that we showed the elevated pedestrian walkway connecting to.

1165
01:51:35,224 --> 01:51:41,088
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're gonna treat this all as one big structure.

1166
01:51:52,754 --> 01:51:55,135
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd be interested in understanding the code approach to that.

1167
01:51:57,877 --> 01:52:01,018
[SPEAKER_18]: But that's probably not a discussion for right now.

1168
01:52:04,700 --> 01:52:07,001
[SPEAKER_18]: Open space requirements.

1169
01:52:08,142 --> 01:52:10,403
[SPEAKER_18]: Let me step back.

1170
01:52:11,883 --> 01:52:15,465
[SPEAKER_18]: What variances are you requesting as part of this project?

1171
01:52:16,447 --> 01:52:17,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1172
01:52:18,168 --> 01:52:20,849
[SPEAKER_04]: We are requesting no variances.

1173
01:52:20,949 --> 01:52:28,791
[SPEAKER_04]: We're asking for a finding from the Zoning Board of Appeals based on three things.

1174
01:52:29,792 --> 01:52:34,953
[SPEAKER_04]: The existing rear yard setback is less than a foot.

1175
01:52:35,033 --> 01:52:39,375
[SPEAKER_04]: The southeast corner is less than a foot from the property line.

1176
01:52:41,116 --> 01:52:43,616
[SPEAKER_04]: In this industrial zoning district today,

1177
01:52:46,938 --> 01:52:51,080
[SPEAKER_04]: allowable stories is two, and the allowable height is 35 feet.

1178
01:52:52,581 --> 01:53:12,993
[SPEAKER_04]: And so those are the three items that we're asking the Zoning Board of Appeals to issue a finding and a special permit that this addition to the building is not more deleterious to the neighborhood than what's existing.

1179
01:53:20,435 --> 01:53:25,038
[SPEAKER_18]: What are we ruling on or eventually ruling on?

1180
01:53:26,819 --> 01:53:32,422
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a site plan review recommendation of the Zoning Board of Appeals.

1181
01:53:34,043 --> 01:53:37,085
[SPEAKER_11]: They are the permit granting entity for this project.

1182
01:53:37,105 --> 01:53:40,947
[SPEAKER_11]: Does that answer?

1183
01:53:41,948 --> 01:53:42,848
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, no, it does.

1184
01:53:43,149 --> 01:53:47,071
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm very confused by the

1185
01:53:48,188 --> 01:53:50,390
[SPEAKER_18]: the approach to planning in this project.

1186
01:53:50,731 --> 01:54:05,305
[SPEAKER_18]: And it may very well be that it's completely correct, but it just seems to me that adding a new building, because to me, this is a new building.

1187
01:54:05,365 --> 01:54:06,246
[SPEAKER_18]: This is not an addition.

1188
01:54:10,997 --> 01:54:18,398
[SPEAKER_18]: three-story bridge does not make one building become part of the, I mean, a three-story, yeah, a three-story bridge does not make one building become part of another.

1189
01:54:19,739 --> 01:54:30,140
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't under, I'm unclear about the zoning and code approach to how that happens.

1190
01:54:31,121 --> 01:54:35,621
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't seem- So that was in the end a ruling by the building commissioner.

1191
01:54:35,882 --> 01:54:37,782
[SPEAKER_11]: So in the packet, the,

1192
01:54:39,499 --> 01:54:50,547
[SPEAKER_11]: The sixth page of the PDF of their thing is the letter, referral letter from the permit refusal letter from the building commissioner.

1193
01:54:51,407 --> 01:55:06,778
[SPEAKER_11]: And so there is, he ruled that this was, would be considered, it's an all one property, that it would be an expansion of an existing non-conforming building on the property

1194
01:55:07,750 --> 01:55:24,279
[SPEAKER_11]: between the existing parking structure and the bridge, it felt that it was a good addition, that it was preferable to have this building with this additional commercial space, the additional R&D, the additional life science jobs.

1195
01:55:27,291 --> 01:55:39,001
[SPEAKER_11]: the commercial space on the ground floor and that it would be that he felt that that would be could be deemed an expansion of an existing building in this fence.

1196
01:55:39,161 --> 01:55:40,082
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all one owner.

1197
01:55:40,162 --> 01:55:41,704
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all one piece of property.

1198
01:55:46,788 --> 01:55:47,809
[SPEAKER_11]: That was his decision.

1199
01:55:51,892 --> 01:55:52,193
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1200
01:55:56,446 --> 01:56:01,630
[SPEAKER_11]: building two separate buildings would be more challenging.

1201
01:56:03,011 --> 01:56:25,989
[SPEAKER_18]: Clearly they've taken this approach because it allows them to build the most building they can, which is smart, but it still makes no sense to me how that, beyond that, as a reaction to the building, I think Boston Ave is a very,

1202
01:56:26,567 --> 01:56:45,159
[SPEAKER_18]: interesting corridor in that it has a certain amount of industrial use, lab use on the east side and very sort of residential use on the west.

1203
01:56:47,700 --> 01:56:55,465
[SPEAKER_18]: I think curiously that the video was the thing that for me really cemented the fact that

1204
01:56:56,085 --> 01:57:03,068
[SPEAKER_18]: this building seems way at a scale for Boston Ave, pushed right up against the road like that.

1205
01:57:03,188 --> 01:57:05,630
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm also thinking about that in concert with open space.

1206
01:57:05,670 --> 01:57:23,478
[SPEAKER_18]: Like I understand that you're doing this thing where you're trying to create an extension of a building, but, and I'm assuming that as part of that, that, and that it's an existing building, somehow that,

1207
01:57:24,124 --> 01:57:26,125
[SPEAKER_18]: exclude you from the open space requirements.

1208
01:57:26,905 --> 01:57:47,531
[SPEAKER_18]: I may be wrong in that, and you can clarify, but when you look at the site plan, the building looks like we're just building right up to the property line in a residential slash industrial neighborhood.

1209
01:57:49,272 --> 01:57:52,733
[SPEAKER_18]: It seems dense and big for that spot,

1210
01:57:53,362 --> 01:58:16,575
[SPEAKER_18]: It's good that it's on the right side of the street so that the shadows and sun don't affect the neighbors badly, but I still feel that there's some sort of mitigation in the architecture to mitigate that height would be merited.

1211
01:58:20,798 --> 01:58:22,999
[SPEAKER_18]: The thing I'm struggling with is exactly the sort of

1212
01:58:27,018 --> 01:58:33,042
[SPEAKER_18]: the approvals route that got us to this design.

1213
01:58:34,263 --> 01:58:40,028
[SPEAKER_18]: But I suppose I can have some more conversations with others offline about that.

1214
01:58:40,148 --> 01:58:43,651
[SPEAKER_18]: But I don't know.

1215
01:58:44,372 --> 01:58:46,293
[SPEAKER_09]: Mike, do you want to respond to any of that?

1216
01:58:46,553 --> 01:58:49,796
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm still very confused about how we got to this.

1217
01:58:53,730 --> 01:58:55,231
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd be happy to, thank you.

1218
01:58:56,633 --> 01:58:58,474
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's an industrial zoning district.

1219
01:59:01,237 --> 01:59:05,861
[SPEAKER_04]: There is no open space requirement in this district, zero.

1220
01:59:06,762 --> 01:59:09,324
[SPEAKER_04]: There is some minimal landscaping here.

1221
01:59:09,685 --> 01:59:13,528
[SPEAKER_04]: This is basically taking an existing footprint and just making it taller.

1222
01:59:13,588 --> 01:59:17,472
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not like we're making it any bigger in that sense.

1223
01:59:19,770 --> 01:59:20,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, pot.

1224
01:59:22,012 --> 01:59:31,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Why did I, why did we get to an addition as opposed to a brand new building to great question.

1225
01:59:31,539 --> 01:59:33,200
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I understand why you did that.

1226
01:59:33,220 --> 01:59:33,300
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1227
01:59:33,320 --> 01:59:33,741
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1228
01:59:33,781 --> 01:59:35,102
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, again, we.

1229
01:59:40,730 --> 01:59:44,631
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I helpfully shed a little light on, again, the industrial zoning district.

1230
01:59:45,112 --> 01:59:47,652
[SPEAKER_04]: We're within the setback there.

1231
01:59:48,373 --> 01:59:57,036
[SPEAKER_04]: There is, as my colleague Brian mentioned, whether it happens or not, or how that goes, there is a move.

1232
01:59:57,436 --> 02:00:08,960
[SPEAKER_04]: The city is looking, working with a zoning consultant to rezone this area, as you know, to an office two district that would potentially

1233
02:00:11,336 --> 02:00:16,781
[SPEAKER_04]: that would potentially put this almost by right without the open space.

1234
02:00:18,983 --> 02:00:20,485
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'd have to look at that a little more.

1235
02:00:20,505 --> 02:00:36,340
[SPEAKER_09]: Mike, could you talk a little bit about any engagement with the neighborhood around there that you might've had and what feedback, if any, you got?

1236
02:00:37,651 --> 02:00:38,451
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, absolutely.

1237
02:00:38,491 --> 02:00:50,078
[SPEAKER_04]: So as I mentioned in April, April 14th, I believe we had a Zoom community outreach meeting and it was pretty well attended and we had a lot of comments from the neighbors.

1238
02:00:51,358 --> 02:00:55,781
[SPEAKER_04]: One of them wanted it to look more like the airport in San Jose.

1239
02:00:55,801 --> 02:01:01,604
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the comments and I would,

1240
02:01:02,578 --> 02:01:10,661
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was the gentleman Doug Carr, who's on the historic commission, who's also an architect, spent a lot of time looking at it.

1241
02:01:10,742 --> 02:01:16,804
[SPEAKER_04]: And his biggest comment was, again, how we're separating the kind of the two.

1242
02:01:16,944 --> 02:01:17,685
[SPEAKER_04]: He actually liked it.

1243
02:01:17,725 --> 02:01:18,945
[SPEAKER_04]: He was pretty positive.

1244
02:01:18,965 --> 02:01:22,206
[SPEAKER_04]: I think every comment for the most part was pretty positive.

1245
02:01:23,427 --> 02:01:25,788
[SPEAKER_04]: He did focus on the kind of separating the two buildings.

1246
02:01:25,828 --> 02:01:29,610
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think he understood that the challenge with that would be we'd kind of,

1247
02:01:31,981 --> 02:01:35,544
[SPEAKER_04]: disadvantage some of the parking if we would have pushed the middle section back.

1248
02:01:36,925 --> 02:01:43,070
[SPEAKER_04]: But other than those kind of architectural feedback, there wasn't a lot of other.

1249
02:01:43,090 --> 02:01:49,335
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think we got anybody from the opposite side of Boston Ave that had any comments.

1250
02:01:53,044 --> 02:02:09,252
[SPEAKER_09]: And my understanding is that this is, uh, could you talk a little bit about how the phasing, when phase, how quickly phase two would happen and was, uh, how does it relate to the, the, the building of the program of the original building?

1251
02:02:09,492 --> 02:02:12,193
[SPEAKER_09]: Kind of the first part of it that's going to be connected to.

1252
02:02:13,814 --> 02:02:14,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, sure.

1253
02:02:14,494 --> 02:02:22,638
[SPEAKER_04]: So, the first phase would be to construct the garage, and I'm not sharing my screen anymore.

1254
02:02:23,418 --> 02:02:29,701
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, no, I mean I recall I'm just wondering about the timeline how quickly would phase two followed phase one, immediately.

1255
02:02:29,881 --> 02:02:30,802
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean our goal is to.

1256
02:02:32,283 --> 02:02:44,090
[SPEAKER_04]: build the garage, be able to use that to make sure that then we're not asking for any parking relief, or we don't have to do any offsite stuff at that point in time.

1257
02:02:44,110 --> 02:02:54,237
[SPEAKER_04]: If we can get the garage up and running, and we'll immediately go right into the construction of phase two, which is the front part of the building, the leaseable part of the building.

1258
02:02:54,882 --> 02:03:03,888
[SPEAKER_04]: And I assume we haven't really worked on it too deeply, but we're kind of looking at kind of nine month, nine month phases for each one of those roughly.

1259
02:03:05,469 --> 02:03:07,010
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'd like to be able to schedule it.

1260
02:03:07,030 --> 02:03:20,859
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's at a downtime, maybe the, the, it begins so that, or the bigger stuff happens that it's, it's in the summer when there's less people in the building and there's less people around, which might be helpful.

1261
02:03:23,028 --> 02:03:31,596
[SPEAKER_09]: And the tenanting of the new part of the building, do you already have tenants lined up?

1262
02:03:33,838 --> 02:03:34,518
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we do not.

1263
02:03:34,638 --> 02:03:40,704
[SPEAKER_04]: We have many existing tenants in the building that have expressed interest in expansion.

1264
02:03:41,816 --> 02:03:44,778
[SPEAKER_04]: And this would be a great opportunity for them to expand in place.

1265
02:03:45,939 --> 02:03:49,462
[SPEAKER_04]: We fully expect this to be a life science building.

1266
02:03:50,543 --> 02:03:53,345
[SPEAKER_04]: It's close to all the transportation in this industry.

1267
02:03:53,966 --> 02:03:56,788
[SPEAKER_04]: It's tough to move them out to Woburn and to Beverly.

1268
02:03:56,828 --> 02:03:58,469
[SPEAKER_04]: They all want to be down in this area.

1269
02:03:58,849 --> 02:04:01,171
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're looking to make that accommodation.

1270
02:04:01,431 --> 02:04:08,537
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have anybody specifically, but as I mentioned earlier, we're happy if anybody wants to, anybody knows anybody looking for space, give us a shout.

1271
02:04:10,636 --> 02:04:12,717
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Chair, may I supplement?

1272
02:04:14,338 --> 02:04:14,458
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

1273
02:04:14,498 --> 02:04:15,619
[SPEAKER_24]: My name is Dennis Clark.

1274
02:04:15,699 --> 02:04:17,460
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm CEO of Cummings Properties.

1275
02:04:18,240 --> 02:04:34,668
[SPEAKER_24]: And when we kicked off this permitting process some number of months ago, we thought at that time, we didn't have a lease in hand, but we thought we knew exactly which of our existing expanding clients was going to take all our substantial portion of this new building.

1276
02:04:35,375 --> 02:04:41,236
[SPEAKER_24]: And if you had asked me if that was still the same plan up to about three days ago, I would have said, yes.

1277
02:04:42,137 --> 02:04:44,957
[SPEAKER_24]: Sitting here right now, I don't know if that's going to happen.

1278
02:04:45,637 --> 02:04:51,179
[SPEAKER_24]: So as we sit here tonight, we still don't have a lease in the end, and we're advancing this on a speculative basis.

1279
02:04:52,519 --> 02:04:55,920
[SPEAKER_24]: But we've been operating this property for almost 30 years.

1280
02:04:56,740 --> 02:04:58,981
[SPEAKER_24]: And over that time, we're very hands on.

1281
02:04:59,201 --> 02:05:03,742
[SPEAKER_24]: We maintain, we design, we build, we finance, we do it all in house.

1282
02:05:04,857 --> 02:05:17,928
[SPEAKER_24]: We have seen the gradual conversion of more and more of these two buildings towards science-based companies, including biotech, and that's the current composition of the building.

1283
02:05:18,729 --> 02:05:25,194
[SPEAKER_24]: So where we've seen demand, this building has been substantially full or full for several years.

1284
02:05:26,075 --> 02:05:29,958
[SPEAKER_24]: And we see more demand than there is supply in the marketplace.

1285
02:05:29,998 --> 02:05:32,560
[SPEAKER_24]: And we think that this is a responsible

1286
02:05:33,088 --> 02:05:45,913
[SPEAKER_24]: way to invest more in Medford and meet some of that demand, and presumably with mostly existing clients in the building, because we've got a couple of dozen in total.

1287
02:05:45,933 --> 02:05:51,135
[SPEAKER_24]: And a number of them are developing science-based firms that are always changing in what they need.

1288
02:05:51,155 --> 02:05:56,577
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, thank you for the clarification, Mr. Clark.

1289
02:06:00,040 --> 02:06:07,745
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, can I add a few comments and some of them might sound a little crazy, but well, my first introduced yourself again.

1290
02:06:07,765 --> 02:06:07,965
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

1291
02:06:08,065 --> 02:06:08,565
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry.

1292
02:06:08,605 --> 02:06:10,647
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm Christie Dowd, member of the board.

1293
02:06:10,667 --> 02:06:11,567
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1294
02:06:12,988 --> 02:06:14,209
[SPEAKER_16]: Does this project have a linkage?

1295
02:06:15,590 --> 02:06:16,971
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, it does.

1296
02:06:17,391 --> 02:06:17,991
[SPEAKER_16]: And what is that?

1297
02:06:18,011 --> 02:06:20,373
[SPEAKER_09]: Estimated around $275,000.

1298
02:06:29,617 --> 02:06:33,742
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, yeah, so that's sort of leading to my second question.

1299
02:06:33,762 --> 02:06:35,805
[SPEAKER_16]: Like what is the give back to the neighborhood?

1300
02:06:36,646 --> 02:06:42,152
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, you know, just that I think there's an opportunity to do something better than a Starbucks.

1301
02:06:43,081 --> 02:06:45,582
[SPEAKER_16]: at the ground floor space.

1302
02:06:45,902 --> 02:07:06,852
[SPEAKER_16]: And if that's commercial space, is there consideration for another gesture of give back to the neighborhood that promotes some sort of educational opportunity at the ground floor, something that promotes equity inclusion within that neighborhood or a neighborhood retailer?

1303
02:07:08,613 --> 02:07:11,674
[SPEAKER_16]: That's just my concerns.

1304
02:07:12,535 --> 02:07:26,380
[SPEAKER_16]: I think across greater Boston, you're seeing a lot of these life sciences buildings going up, and there is a huge focus on the ground floor commercial space to give back to the community in some way.

1305
02:07:27,541 --> 02:07:33,123
[SPEAKER_16]: And my last comment is, I understand the phasing, but it does concern me that

1306
02:07:34,335 --> 02:07:46,740
[SPEAKER_16]: with this being speculative, the garage being built first and having some sort of commitment to ensure that that's the building itself gets built, like then there's just not a garage.

1307
02:07:47,320 --> 02:07:48,360
[SPEAKER_16]: And we've got a lot of parking.

1308
02:07:48,380 --> 02:07:52,602
[SPEAKER_16]: So I don't know if there's any response to that.

1309
02:07:55,143 --> 02:07:55,483
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1310
02:07:55,703 --> 02:07:56,183
[SPEAKER_16]: That's all I have.

1311
02:08:00,474 --> 02:08:05,520
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd be happy to speak to both your excellent points.

1312
02:08:05,560 --> 02:08:06,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.

1313
02:08:07,502 --> 02:08:09,324
[SPEAKER_04]: We put Starbucks there as a placeholder.

1314
02:08:09,705 --> 02:08:16,232
[SPEAKER_04]: We're hoping it's a smaller community, something smaller, more organic.

1315
02:08:21,095 --> 02:08:33,543
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, maybe it's a mom and pop coffee shop that can serve the neighborhood or it's a dry cleaner, whatever works best down there, whatever kind of neighborhood amenity that needs a space like that, it's available.

1316
02:08:34,124 --> 02:08:34,984
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the intention.

1317
02:08:35,525 --> 02:08:38,206
[SPEAKER_04]: We just kind of grabbed a logo and tried to show something there.

1318
02:08:40,067 --> 02:08:48,513
[SPEAKER_04]: Regarding the parking garage, I don't know what to say other than there is no chance that we're gonna build a parking garage

1319
02:08:49,373 --> 02:08:53,316
[SPEAKER_04]: None, none, none, none, and then not follow up with this.

1320
02:08:53,917 --> 02:09:00,242
[SPEAKER_04]: This is, we're not doing this to build a parking garage, we're doing it to build the leaseable space.

1321
02:09:00,522 --> 02:09:12,452
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to add to that, given, or just to add to the points I made when presenting the parking information, it simply wouldn't make economic sense to build an enlarged parking garage because currently,

1322
02:09:12,952 --> 02:09:17,473
[SPEAKER_01]: we have more than sufficient number of spaces to serve the existing building's needs.

1323
02:09:17,993 --> 02:09:26,936
[SPEAKER_01]: So the building of a parking garage is driven by the proposed addition and the additional leaseable space that it would yield.

1324
02:09:27,076 --> 02:09:28,937
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are entirely connected.

1325
02:09:31,077 --> 02:09:33,638
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, Dennis, if you had anything to add.

1326
02:09:33,738 --> 02:09:35,598
[SPEAKER_24]: That's where I was going to, Brian, thank you.

1327
02:09:38,959 --> 02:09:39,520
[SPEAKER_09]: Great, thank you.

1328
02:09:43,220 --> 02:09:57,349
[SPEAKER_09]: board members, any other questions you'd like to bring up at this time before we open up the public participation portion of the hearing?

1329
02:09:57,549 --> 02:10:11,317
[SPEAKER_18]: I guess I just would follow up, and I know I'm a little bit of a broken record at this point, but I would encourage you to look at the massing of the building and how it addresses the street and how the landscaping

1330
02:10:13,664 --> 02:10:22,352
[SPEAKER_18]: is thought of in a holistic way with the whole of the project massing and how it touches the street.

1331
02:10:23,173 --> 02:10:35,465
[SPEAKER_18]: And I also think, you know, it's a curious design problem in that area where there's very much a very diverse

1332
02:10:37,562 --> 02:10:41,384
[SPEAKER_18]: number of types of buildings and uses along that edge.

1333
02:10:42,464 --> 02:10:56,170
[SPEAKER_18]: I mentioned the residential across the street, but if you think about that side of Boston Ave, you have everything along there from homes to antique shops to gas stations to U-Haul.

1334
02:10:56,470 --> 02:11:06,034
[SPEAKER_18]: So thinking about the retail and the ground floor uses, how the building meets the street and how it could sort of start to tell a story

1335
02:11:07,468 --> 02:11:11,169
[SPEAKER_18]: of how it gets stitched together, Boston.

1336
02:11:11,249 --> 02:11:13,750
[SPEAKER_18]: It's something I think I would really encourage you to think about.

1337
02:11:17,051 --> 02:11:28,595
[SPEAKER_09]: Since we, the city department heads have taken a look at this, I'm wondering if the city engineer, Tim McGivern would like to speak up or... Sure.

1338
02:11:35,710 --> 02:11:36,010
[SPEAKER_09]: given.

1339
02:11:36,090 --> 02:11:37,331
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for joining.

1340
02:11:38,311 --> 02:11:38,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

1341
02:11:38,671 --> 02:11:42,833
[SPEAKER_05]: Andre, did you have any specific questions for me or did you want me to kind of give you?

1342
02:11:42,893 --> 02:11:49,917
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm wondering, I know that in your letter you raised some issues and I know, you know, Klaus is raising some issues right now.

1343
02:11:49,937 --> 02:11:53,018
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm wondering whether you wanted to highlight anything in particular.

1344
02:11:55,920 --> 02:12:01,542
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, as proponents stated, they did meet with us preliminarily and discussed things.

1345
02:12:02,563 --> 02:12:02,923
[SPEAKER_05]: Generally,

1346
02:12:03,690 --> 02:12:05,773
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, from a utility standpoint there.

1347
02:12:06,213 --> 02:12:07,915
[SPEAKER_05]: They appear to be heading down the right direction.

1348
02:12:14,012 --> 02:12:16,113
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I could go into all kinds of details.

1349
02:12:16,133 --> 02:12:18,433
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll just do each one roughly.

1350
02:12:18,553 --> 02:12:22,254
[SPEAKER_05]: Stormwater system, they connect to actually a non-Medford system.

1351
02:12:22,294 --> 02:12:23,194
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a private system.

1352
02:12:23,575 --> 02:12:26,855
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't actually know who owns it, but it discharges to the river.

1353
02:12:28,376 --> 02:12:33,017
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it's a redevelopment project, reducing impervious area.

1354
02:12:33,337 --> 02:12:41,099
[SPEAKER_05]: So the idea of cisterns really kind of is something that I think makes a lot of sense here if they can use the irrigation water.

1355
02:12:42,919 --> 02:12:52,921
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, you know, by converting roofed parking to just a regular roof does contribute to water quality, as well as the reduction of impervious area.

1356
02:12:53,281 --> 02:13:08,325
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, and I've asked them to take, take a look at the onsite system as far as the collection that's there now and making some sort of baseline improvements just kind of getting things up to where they should be keeping floatables and oils out of the, out of the river.

1357
02:13:09,706 --> 02:13:13,193
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as water, they have their own on-site private system.

1358
02:13:13,474 --> 02:13:20,127
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm asking them to confirm that it is looped so they can have fire protection service from two sources.

1359
02:13:21,092 --> 02:13:22,032
[SPEAKER_05]: and not just one.

1360
02:13:23,273 --> 02:13:30,095
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm certain they probably talked about that with Mr. Kerger today and figuring that piece out of it.

1361
02:13:31,395 --> 02:13:32,656
[SPEAKER_05]: And then what am I forgetting, sewer.

1362
02:13:32,996 --> 02:13:38,798
[SPEAKER_05]: I've asked them to just making sure they're taking a look at where their sewage is going right now.

1363
02:13:39,638 --> 02:13:42,519
[SPEAKER_05]: It goes into, part of it goes into an oil grid separator.

1364
02:13:43,139 --> 02:14:04,034
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so I've asked them to separate the traditional wastewater flow from the oil grit flow to protect that unit, do maintenance, video inspect the private service to get to our system, and also to inspect for any infiltration or inflows, which, you know, it's pretty baseline stuff.

1365
02:14:05,034 --> 02:14:05,314
[SPEAKER_05]: And then,

1366
02:14:07,607 --> 02:14:22,409
[SPEAKER_05]: from a site perspective, again, there's an existing footprint there and given for where it is and what they're doing, I didn't have any general site issues with the programming that they're proposing.

1367
02:14:23,310 --> 02:14:30,531
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a slight increase in landscaping area out front with sort of a pedestrian amenity along the front of the property.

1368
02:14:30,551 --> 02:14:33,831
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that'll do well for the area.

1369
02:14:33,851 --> 02:14:35,412
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Mr.

1370
02:14:38,531 --> 02:14:39,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, close.

1371
02:14:39,731 --> 02:14:40,252
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

1372
02:14:40,272 --> 02:14:41,332
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how to pronounce your last name.

1373
02:14:41,352 --> 02:14:42,132
[SPEAKER_05]: I just looked at it real quick.

1374
02:14:42,172 --> 02:14:42,673
[SPEAKER_05]: I apologize.

1375
02:14:43,053 --> 02:14:44,053
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

1376
02:14:44,153 --> 02:14:46,634
[SPEAKER_05]: Andresen.

1377
02:14:46,894 --> 02:14:47,374
[SPEAKER_05]: Andresen.

1378
02:14:47,474 --> 02:14:48,275
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Mr. Andresen.

1379
02:14:48,595 --> 02:14:56,238
[SPEAKER_05]: Makes a good point, you know, as far as the massing of the building and how, you know, Boston Ave takes that.

1380
02:14:56,398 --> 02:15:04,280
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I'm not an architect, but I kind of felt that in the renderings too, but, you know, that's not for my place to say one way or the other.

1381
02:15:05,761 --> 02:15:21,546
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we had some recommendations that we felt were appropriate given the traffic analysis, similar to the last project we went over, sort of giving a menu of options that are somewhat smaller improvements, capping at about 20,000.

1382
02:15:21,946 --> 02:15:25,067
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Todd is here, can give details on that.

1383
02:15:25,727 --> 02:15:33,330
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the last element I'll talk about real quick is frontage and making some real modest frontage improvements, I think is all

1384
02:15:33,790 --> 02:15:39,192
[SPEAKER_05]: all that we'd be asking for here, and replacing busted concrete panels, sidewalk panels.

1385
02:15:39,272 --> 02:15:43,253
[SPEAKER_05]: In general, it's in fair plus to good condition, that sidewalk, I'd say good.

1386
02:15:43,854 --> 02:15:45,554
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's some cracked panels, some heaving.

1387
02:15:47,095 --> 02:15:49,435
[SPEAKER_05]: We've asked them to take a look at their entrances.

1388
02:15:49,736 --> 02:15:57,098
[SPEAKER_05]: Usually here in the city, we like to have entrances that are either treated like a roadway or treated like a driveway and not in the middle.

1389
02:15:57,478 --> 02:16:00,079
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now, they're in the middle, so we're asking them to make some improvements there.

1390
02:16:01,059 --> 02:16:01,600
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty modest.

1391
02:16:02,983 --> 02:16:04,024
[SPEAKER_05]: And what else?

1392
02:16:04,404 --> 02:16:14,071
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think, Todd, if you wanted to go into some of the menus of options that you've put in there, I think that might be the logical next step.

1393
02:16:14,832 --> 02:16:15,292
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you.

1394
02:16:15,312 --> 02:16:16,173
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm open for questions as well.

1395
02:16:17,335 --> 02:16:17,535
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1396
02:16:17,575 --> 02:16:38,430
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, Tim, before you go, can I just, can I ask one follow-up question, which is around, you know, we have an email in our materials from Dave Proctor, the superintendent of water and sewer, and I'm just a little confused about the, you know, what's going on with the water and sewer connections.

1397
02:16:39,591 --> 02:16:41,353
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you, was there some follow-up on that?

1398
02:16:44,498 --> 02:16:48,801
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't actually spoken, I'm not aware of the email, I haven't actually spoken to Dave.

1399
02:16:50,662 --> 02:16:54,705
[SPEAKER_05]: So Dave projects the water purveyor, he leads the water and sewage division.

1400
02:16:54,825 --> 02:16:58,227
[SPEAKER_05]: So from a practical standpoint, they'll need to get inspections and things like that.

1401
02:16:59,568 --> 02:17:01,670
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, he's probably looking at similar things I'm looking at.

1402
02:17:01,990 --> 02:17:04,692
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now, I don't have records for a looped connection.

1403
02:17:05,572 --> 02:17:08,935
[SPEAKER_05]: So the project is stating that they have a looped connection.

1404
02:17:10,336 --> 02:17:12,399
[SPEAKER_05]: from North Street to Boston Avenue.

1405
02:17:12,980 --> 02:17:20,191
[SPEAKER_05]: So that would allow them to pull their services off of that loop and meet fire protection site code basically.

1406
02:17:21,633 --> 02:17:23,896
[SPEAKER_05]: But if they don't have that, then they would

1407
02:17:24,477 --> 02:17:29,040
[SPEAKER_05]: most likely need to figure out a way to loop it or put the connections into Boston Avenue.

1408
02:17:29,361 --> 02:17:34,544
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what Dave has said, but that's roughly what's going on with the water.

1409
02:17:34,925 --> 02:17:41,349
[SPEAKER_05]: And sewer, it's an on-site collection system with, I believe, one connection to our city system.

1410
02:17:48,835 --> 02:17:49,515
[SPEAKER_09]: So.

1411
02:17:50,076 --> 02:17:53,218
[SPEAKER_09]: So the email from Dave Proctor

1412
02:17:56,804 --> 02:18:05,670
[SPEAKER_09]: basically says the MWRA should be involved as an 8M permit will be required along with the water sewer separator.

1413
02:18:05,710 --> 02:18:16,917
[SPEAKER_09]: The eight inch water service will need to be replaced as Elizabeth Grady is also on the eight inch water line that supplies fire service.

1414
02:18:17,517 --> 02:18:18,858
[SPEAKER_09]: Sewer would need to be videoed.

1415
02:18:18,878 --> 02:18:18,918
[SPEAKER_09]: So,

1416
02:18:21,862 --> 02:18:26,524
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just wondering if there's somebody on the call who can clarify what's going on there.

1417
02:18:27,344 --> 02:18:29,265
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if Mike O'Vaney, you can do that.

1418
02:18:29,285 --> 02:18:30,666
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so.

1419
02:18:31,827 --> 02:18:34,748
[SPEAKER_04]: So we actually met with Peter Krieger this morning.

1420
02:18:35,808 --> 02:18:37,109
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe I can clarify some of the stuff.

1421
02:18:37,129 --> 02:18:43,672
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, all the comments from the engineering department, including the traffic ones,

1422
02:18:45,423 --> 02:18:48,984
[SPEAKER_04]: that in the menu that was offered in the traffic ones were amenable to that.

1423
02:18:49,024 --> 02:18:58,167
[SPEAKER_04]: There were some things there that were comfortable moving forward with and everything that Tim mentioned in his letter all make sense and they're all readily achievable.

1424
02:18:59,768 --> 02:19:13,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Regarding the water, so when we met with Peter today, we learned, if you go out there, you chase these water gates all the way up through the adjacent property at 222 Boston Ave, which is the,

1425
02:19:14,562 --> 02:19:17,064
[SPEAKER_04]: larger four-story Elizabeth Grady building.

1426
02:19:17,084 --> 02:19:21,346
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's water gates that go all the way up to North Ave, North Street.

1427
02:19:22,407 --> 02:19:31,393
[SPEAKER_04]: So we had made the assumption that that was a looped connection when we met with Peter today.

1428
02:19:31,533 --> 02:19:37,577
[SPEAKER_04]: When I spoke with Peter, I spoke with Peter Tuesday, he said, let me dig up some maps and I'll meet you there this morning.

1429
02:19:38,562 --> 02:19:54,706
[SPEAKER_04]: So we met with them this morning and we kind of learned that it might only be a two-inch line that comes off of North Ave that serves the 222 and 230, and that it potentially terminates there.

1430
02:19:55,286 --> 02:20:00,947
[SPEAKER_04]: There's an eight-inch line on our site that runs between the buildings that provides the fire service to 222.

1431
02:20:06,822 --> 02:20:20,627
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also an eight inch line that runs down the north driveway on our property that connects to the fire service for 196 Boston Ave, which is the building adjacent to the north building.

1432
02:20:22,067 --> 02:20:26,109
[SPEAKER_04]: What we talked about with Peter was, okay, a couple of options.

1433
02:20:26,649 --> 02:20:28,910
[SPEAKER_04]: There was an option to do a triple gate connection.

1434
02:20:30,040 --> 02:20:31,541
[SPEAKER_04]: as we've proposed on the plans.

1435
02:20:31,581 --> 02:20:33,262
[SPEAKER_04]: And he seemed to think that that would work.

1436
02:20:34,003 --> 02:20:44,069
[SPEAKER_04]: It was also a next step, next level option, which would be connect to that line that runs from the north driveway to the one that serves the building through the garage.

1437
02:20:44,129 --> 02:20:50,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it might be a hundred feet of pipe that we could install to then at least have a connection from two locations.

1438
02:20:50,513 --> 02:20:53,235
[SPEAKER_04]: And Peter thought that would be acceptable as well.

1439
02:20:53,855 --> 02:20:55,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Then the third thing we talked about was that

1440
02:20:57,881 --> 02:21:01,410
[SPEAKER_04]: As, as we've learned and the city may be aware.

1441
02:21:03,663 --> 02:21:08,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Elizabeth Grady, that property, they're looking to kind of redevelop that as well, potentially in the near future.

1442
02:21:08,907 --> 02:21:25,901
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a possibility if something happens on that site, that the requirement would be for that development to take an eight inch line from North Ave and run it down the driveway and connect it to the eight inch line that's already there creating another loop.

1443
02:21:25,961 --> 02:21:31,826
[SPEAKER_04]: So there were some very achievable options there that Peter presented and I think,

1444
02:21:33,082 --> 02:21:41,665
[SPEAKER_04]: all of them, different levels of options that can be enacted to make this satisfactory to the water department.

1445
02:21:41,885 --> 02:21:44,346
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're comfortable continuing to work with them on this.

1446
02:21:44,366 --> 02:21:48,547
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1447
02:21:48,608 --> 02:21:50,568
[SPEAKER_09]: Tim McGibbon, did you have, I see you're unmuted.

1448
02:21:50,588 --> 02:21:52,329
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if you wanted to comment on that at all.

1449
02:21:54,730 --> 02:21:57,491
[SPEAKER_05]: I can comment on that it sounds reasonable.

1450
02:21:57,571 --> 02:22:01,072
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically the issue is without having a loop

1451
02:22:02,879 --> 02:22:04,762
[SPEAKER_05]: only have one source for fire.

1452
02:22:04,942 --> 02:22:06,344
[SPEAKER_05]: So you obviously can't isolate that.

1453
02:22:06,364 --> 02:22:09,569
[SPEAKER_05]: So you shut it off, buildings need water, etc, etc.

1454
02:22:09,809 --> 02:22:19,042
[SPEAKER_05]: So what he was talking about is creating that loop in sounds like three different ways, right?

1455
02:22:19,062 --> 02:22:19,102
[SPEAKER_05]: So

1456
02:22:19,928 --> 02:22:27,596
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and what we're talking about now does, you know, and Dave had sounds like he had some information regarding water quality in there and age of pipes and things like that.

1457
02:22:27,656 --> 02:22:32,582
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe all of that usually will come out when they do the fire flow test.

1458
02:22:32,622 --> 02:22:41,512
[SPEAKER_05]: If they do a fire flow test and the flows aren't high enough and it's an eight inch line, it means that it's most likely, you know, tuberculated or in bad condition or whatever.

1459
02:22:42,312 --> 02:22:45,255
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know, it goes back to it's a private site main.

1460
02:22:45,275 --> 02:22:53,161
[SPEAKER_05]: So what I'm looking for is that they're meeting standards for fire protection for their building on the site, the site water system.

1461
02:22:53,441 --> 02:23:00,667
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it sounds like what I'm saying is consistent with what the meeting with the water department, how that went.

1462
02:23:00,767 --> 02:23:03,469
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just going to confirm that I'll talk to those guys and sure anyway.

1463
02:23:05,011 --> 02:23:06,792
Okay.

1464
02:23:06,892 --> 02:23:07,372
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1465
02:23:08,633 --> 02:23:19,561
[SPEAKER_09]: Todd Blake, can you speak a little bit to your perspective on what's being proposed in terms of the pedestrian environment, parking, traffic, et cetera?

1466
02:23:22,864 --> 02:23:29,929
[SPEAKER_25]: I was just wondering, too, Andre, if we were going to hear from World Tech and get a summary of their traffic study at all.

1467
02:23:34,593 --> 02:23:35,633
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have someone?

1468
02:23:35,653 --> 02:23:35,714
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

1469
02:23:38,457 --> 02:23:41,658
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe Rod Emery from World Tech is available.

1470
02:23:41,678 --> 02:23:51,282
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so maybe why don't we do that then Todd you can kind of address all of it at once.

1471
02:23:51,302 --> 02:23:55,664
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that all right?

1472
02:23:56,124 --> 02:23:56,724
[SPEAKER_19]: Sure.

1473
02:23:57,224 --> 02:24:03,687
[SPEAKER_19]: Rod Emery from World Tech Engineering and did a traditional traffic impact study for the area.

1474
02:24:05,233 --> 02:24:20,139
[SPEAKER_19]: Probably where we started was the study area, we sort of had a block around the site, you know, Mystic Valley Parkway, Boston Ave, North Ave and Auburn Street sort of form this circle around the site.

1475
02:24:21,599 --> 02:24:24,541
[SPEAKER_19]: We performed traffic counts last March.

1476
02:24:25,001 --> 02:24:28,162
[SPEAKER_19]: They form the basis of the existing volume network.

1477
02:24:29,501 --> 02:24:38,687
[SPEAKER_19]: We factored them up for seasonal conditions and growth, as well as the pandemic, we applied some factors to that.

1478
02:24:40,368 --> 02:24:46,432
[SPEAKER_19]: And we created a seven year down the road, a 2028 no build network.

1479
02:24:46,552 --> 02:24:50,815
[SPEAKER_19]: So if nothing was happening at the site, this is what traffic would look like at these intersections.

1480
02:24:52,936 --> 02:24:57,940
[SPEAKER_19]: Mystic Valley Parkway carries about three times as much traffic as Boston Avenue and Boston Ave

1481
02:24:59,605 --> 02:25:00,945
[SPEAKER_19]: minor arterial in the city.

1482
02:25:01,705 --> 02:25:06,046
[SPEAKER_19]: And we also cross a couple jurisdictions Mr. Valley Parkway is belongs to DCR.

1483
02:25:06,666 --> 02:25:10,867
[SPEAKER_19]: We're right on the Somerville border, so we have some interesting crossovers there.

1484
02:25:12,347 --> 02:25:15,048
[SPEAKER_19]: We, we, after we built the no build network.

1485
02:25:15,448 --> 02:25:25,750
[SPEAKER_19]: We applied some traffic volumes based on the build condition, which was what was 67,000 square feet of research and development, and actually.

1486
02:25:27,399 --> 02:25:47,235
[SPEAKER_19]: We were a little bit on the conservative side the 3000 square feet of amenity space is actually included in the 67 we put it outside and actually added traffic to it based on, not a, not a Starbucks but a what we call a casual restaurant, and actually the casual restaurant at 3000 square feet.

1487
02:25:49,225 --> 02:25:54,147
[SPEAKER_19]: generated as much peak hour traffic as the 67,000 square feet of development.

1488
02:25:54,207 --> 02:25:57,969
[SPEAKER_19]: So we think we've created a fairly conservative picture of traffic impacts.

1489
02:25:59,610 --> 02:26:07,213
[SPEAKER_19]: The signals on the corners of most of these intersections work reasonably well.

1490
02:26:07,893 --> 02:26:12,595
[SPEAKER_19]: The Cigali Parkway has some long queues, but they serve a lot of traffic through their lanes.

1491
02:26:13,476 --> 02:26:14,876
[SPEAKER_19]: I think the signals are pretty old.

1492
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:24,646
[SPEAKER_19]: We looked at levels of service on along Boston Avenue the driveway is called come out at a level of service which is the best.

1493
02:26:25,627 --> 02:26:28,370
[SPEAKER_19]: And some of the side streets in the residential neighborhood.

1494
02:26:33,795 --> 02:26:37,998
[SPEAKER_19]: The DCR is in the midst of doing they just released their parkways master plan.

1495
02:26:39,058 --> 02:27:02,312
[SPEAKER_19]: And this section of course is included in their master plan all the parkways they're doing and there seems to be a theme of them eliminating lanes to try to improve pedestrian and bicycle accommodation so we did a secondary analysis in the appendix for Mississippi Valley Parkway is if it was a one lane roadway instead of a, you know, two lane roadway as it is today.

1496
02:27:03,815 --> 02:27:12,823
[SPEAKER_19]: Most of the problems we found were not operational problems, but they were the two DCR locations or high crash locations.

1497
02:27:13,864 --> 02:27:20,330
[SPEAKER_19]: And so more of the effort is on the safety aspects of the intersections.

1498
02:27:21,066 --> 02:27:23,568
[SPEAKER_19]: We did look at the impacts.

1499
02:27:24,749 --> 02:27:35,236
[SPEAKER_19]: We have something like, at the most, we kept the additional traffic at under 20 cars per hour per intersection so as they spread out and they dissipate.

1500
02:27:35,256 --> 02:27:37,297
[SPEAKER_19]: There was minimal impacts.

1501
02:27:37,837 --> 02:27:43,981
[SPEAKER_19]: We had a couple of seconds of more delay a couple, maybe 15 feet of more queuing space.

1502
02:27:45,122 --> 02:28:11,942
[SPEAKER_19]: We thought that the signals on Misty Valley Parkway could be improved by some timing adjustments, we feel that their clearance intervals are fine, but their crash rate is really due to a large volume of traffic that they service, you know, in two lanes of road that are very tight, they're very tight lanes, there's no shoulders, and the turning traffic has to stop in the middle of a through lane and it makes it so a very,

1503
02:28:13,733 --> 02:28:14,553
[SPEAKER_19]: hard situation.

1504
02:28:14,573 --> 02:28:25,557
[SPEAKER_19]: One of the things that was interesting is they had a lot of crashes that happened during rainy conditions or wet pavement conditions which surprised me, just at Auburn and Mystic Valley Parkway.

1505
02:28:27,158 --> 02:28:40,063
[SPEAKER_19]: One of the recommendations in the parkways master plan was that they wanted somebody to do an analysis of the one lane road in which we provided in the, in our traffic study so kind of really fast that kind of wraps up the

1506
02:28:41,023 --> 02:28:48,368
[SPEAKER_19]: study and I can comment on Todd's recommendations or I can, we can have a little conversation about that.

1507
02:28:48,869 --> 02:28:57,855
[SPEAKER_19]: I, I think there's some really good recommendations here on bicycle bus and pedestrian facilities that we can incorporate into the project.

1508
02:28:58,536 --> 02:29:08,383
[SPEAKER_19]: There are some other recommendations at the mystic Valley Parkway intersections adding signal heads and back plates, and some lens changes.

1509
02:29:09,494 --> 02:29:20,397
[SPEAKER_19]: which can be more difficult when you have old signals that structurally the sooner mast arms wouldn't wouldn't be able to absorb all that extra weight and wind load.

1510
02:29:21,557 --> 02:29:33,940
[SPEAKER_19]: We did, we did point out that they really should have a road safety audit done to sort of come up with a menu of full menu of safety improvements that go with those two to signalize locations, but I'll end it there.

1511
02:29:37,727 --> 02:29:38,427
[SPEAKER_17]: This is Jackie.

1512
02:29:38,547 --> 02:29:39,988
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't have a point of clarification.

1513
02:29:40,008 --> 02:29:52,293
[SPEAKER_17]: If you can go back to when you spoke on the level of service a were you referring to Boston have or missing Valley Parkway route 16 Boston have where the where the side streets and driveways are.

1514
02:29:52,789 --> 02:29:57,573
[SPEAKER_17]: where the side streets and driveways are as a level of English, and you said it was high.

1515
02:29:58,053 --> 02:30:08,361
[SPEAKER_17]: Can we unpack, you said it was the highest level can we unpack what the highest level meant that literally means that it's free flow traffic with individual users virtually unaffected by the presence of others in the traffic stream.

1516
02:30:08,641 --> 02:30:09,622
[SPEAKER_17]: So what you're saying is that.

1517
02:30:11,754 --> 02:30:30,083
[SPEAKER_17]: The Boston app that you've taken up, and this is in peak hours and peak hours, but that include when the Tufts University students because that's pretty much a grad area I lived right at 258 Boston Ave and I, I just don't see level service, a and I'm just trying to figure out what your peak hours were the basic.

1518
02:30:31,855 --> 02:30:36,859
[SPEAKER_19]: measure of level of service is based on how many seconds of delay you have to wait to make a maneuver.

1519
02:30:36,899 --> 02:30:45,386
[SPEAKER_19]: So at a signal, you're going back and forth between the main street and the side street and cars are delayed a certain average number for the whole intersection.

1520
02:30:45,406 --> 02:30:52,352
[SPEAKER_19]: And sometimes one approach can be closer to failure than it is an A-level service.

1521
02:30:52,392 --> 02:30:54,514
[SPEAKER_19]: Certainly the signals are not at A-levels of service.

1522
02:30:55,500 --> 02:30:58,861
[SPEAKER_19]: The driveways are how long you have to wait to come out of a driveway.

1523
02:30:58,961 --> 02:31:08,625
[SPEAKER_19]: Basically, Boston Ave doesn't stop for the side streets or the driveways coming out so it's really just looking at how long does it take a driver to come out of a driveway onto Boston Ave.

1524
02:31:09,722 --> 02:31:27,338
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's without taking I'm just trying to figure out I do know that it's a minor arterial Boston F right, then you have the cross connector there, actually they're all trying to get to connectors which are major highways which, whether it's going east, west or east on on 16 I'm just, I'm having a hard time seeing.

1525
02:31:29,462 --> 02:31:37,268
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm just having a hard time with the study without seeing the actual details behind the study, not just from living there, but also being a Tufts alum in that area.

1526
02:31:37,368 --> 02:31:43,812
[SPEAKER_17]: And I also have a project over in that area with the Green Line coming right there on Route 16.

1527
02:31:43,872 --> 02:31:45,273
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm just having a hard time seeing.

1528
02:31:47,174 --> 02:31:49,515
[SPEAKER_17]: that having a level service of a. That's all.

1529
02:31:49,996 --> 02:31:55,659
[SPEAKER_19]: Again, it's really the side street that's been that would on a driveway or an uncivilized location.

1530
02:31:56,079 --> 02:32:01,282
[SPEAKER_19]: There's certainly the signals that Boston and North Street is more like a BA think a level of service I remember right.

1531
02:32:01,842 --> 02:32:05,905
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think, Boston Abbott and Mr. Valley Parkway is a B as well.

1532
02:32:06,725 --> 02:32:10,808
[SPEAKER_19]: But there are certain approaches that are approaching capacity so I don't want to mislead you that.

1533
02:32:11,746 --> 02:32:16,549
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, overall level of service, we do factor all the approaches together and sort of average them.

1534
02:32:17,029 --> 02:32:21,852
[SPEAKER_19]: Sometimes there's one or two of them that are really close to capacity and would be like an E level of service.

1535
02:32:23,153 --> 02:32:28,416
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, E meaning the worst failing and... No, F is failing.

1536
02:32:29,417 --> 02:32:30,717
[SPEAKER_17]: F is failing at capacity.

1537
02:32:31,398 --> 02:32:32,398
[SPEAKER_17]: I just wanted to make sure.

1538
02:32:32,859 --> 02:32:37,562
[SPEAKER_17]: So you did a collective overall of the area and the site affecting the property.

1539
02:32:38,632 --> 02:32:40,153
[SPEAKER_17]: is what you're saying is level of A only.

1540
02:32:40,273 --> 02:32:41,694
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, so all right, thank you.

1541
02:32:42,074 --> 02:32:43,835
[SPEAKER_17]: No further questions, I just wanted clarity.

1542
02:32:43,855 --> 02:32:57,804
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, maybe we could go to, it's a Todd Blake from the city, just to comment on what we're hearing and also your recommendations, Todd.

1543
02:33:03,247 --> 02:33:04,148
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. Chair.

1544
02:33:05,148 --> 02:33:07,290
[SPEAKER_20]: So yeah, as I mentioned in our comment letter,

1545
02:33:09,552 --> 02:33:17,795
[SPEAKER_20]: Basically due to the, you know, too high crash locations high crash rate locations that this project will contribute traffic to.

1546
02:33:18,555 --> 02:33:24,417
[SPEAKER_20]: And also, just the net trips it's adding in the peak hours and the am peak it's adding 35 p.m.

1547
02:33:24,457 --> 02:33:24,997
[SPEAKER_20]: peak 75 and daily 1600.

1548
02:33:25,097 --> 02:33:26,518
[SPEAKER_20]: Just as other reviews we've done.

1549
02:33:34,158 --> 02:33:58,523
[SPEAKER_20]: point out that any additional new trips may exacerbate existing issues such as the crash history at those two Mystic Valley Parkway locations, and also whatever you can do to promote transit, cycling, and pedestrian access that would reduce the vehicle impacts to the neighboring community, that road, those intersections.

1550
02:33:59,343 --> 02:34:13,684
[SPEAKER_20]: So my recommendations are based on that the proportional what I believe is proportional, relatively, for this project to the area, and I recommend a menu of options for the board or and or the proponent to consider.

1551
02:34:14,986 --> 02:34:21,711
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, and by no means an exhaustive list, but it just gives a sampling of what could be possible.

1552
02:34:22,212 --> 02:34:31,420
[SPEAKER_20]: So for, for the cycling amenities, just looking at kind of upgrading the Boston have bike lanes and shares that are out there now.

1553
02:34:32,120 --> 02:34:47,753
[SPEAKER_20]: to emphasize, especially the conflict points for the cyclists with a bike lane cross the side streets, and possibly super shares on the downhill share, just to further emphasize those amenities for cyclists to further encourage cycling.

1554
02:34:48,373 --> 02:35:05,187
[SPEAKER_20]: And then for pedestrians, the two crosswalks that would that are uncivilized crosswalks crossing towards the site to enhance them in any way possible, and to, if they're deficient in accessibility to do that as well.

1555
02:35:05,727 --> 02:35:12,793
[SPEAKER_20]: So that safety wise, you know this, there's so much that can be done at those two intersections, you know it's not necessarily, you know,

1556
02:35:13,453 --> 02:35:16,555
[SPEAKER_20]: shouldn't, this proponent shouldn't be held to fix all those.

1557
02:35:16,595 --> 02:35:24,541
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's why I was trying to recommend some things that are somewhat proportion that could add some measure of safety to those to hopefully reduce some crashes.

1558
02:35:25,202 --> 02:35:29,004
[SPEAKER_20]: And as Rod pointed out, some of the equipment is pretty old.

1559
02:35:29,104 --> 02:35:38,671
[SPEAKER_20]: So, you know, they could look at it and see what they recommend with, you know, with in consultation with DCR or Somerville in the case of Boston Abbott, Mystic Valley.

1560
02:35:39,852 --> 02:35:46,133
[SPEAKER_20]: One thing I really noticed today going back out there is in the eastbound direction on Mystic Valley Parkway.

1561
02:35:47,574 --> 02:35:52,175
[SPEAKER_20]: It's the only approach of the two intersections that doesn't have an overhead component.

1562
02:35:52,515 --> 02:36:00,537
[SPEAKER_20]: So there's a master with the signal head facing the westbound traffic but not the eastbound traffic at Boston Avenue and Mystic Valley Parkway.

1563
02:36:01,397 --> 02:36:05,298
[SPEAKER_20]: And coming on that approach, there's only two side mounted and one of them's

1564
02:36:07,018 --> 02:36:12,300
[SPEAKER_20]: trees are blocking the view of one, and the other is momentarily, at times, behind a post.

1565
02:36:12,960 --> 02:36:26,204
[SPEAKER_20]: So the addition of an overhead signal head in that approach could, you know, could incrementally improve safety there, visibility of the signal, and make people aware of the red or green prior to.

1566
02:36:26,564 --> 02:36:29,665
[SPEAKER_20]: And Rod did point out a good point about the load.

1567
02:36:30,705 --> 02:36:31,686
[SPEAKER_20]: If it's hanging versus,

1568
02:36:34,103 --> 02:36:40,966
[SPEAKER_20]: you know, mounted onto the arm, maybe it won't contribute to the wind load that much, one extra head.

1569
02:36:41,086 --> 02:36:42,286
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's something to consider.

1570
02:36:44,247 --> 02:36:50,370
[SPEAKER_20]: Things like that, you know, the signal system, it's so old that it still has incandescent bulbs versus LEDs.

1571
02:36:50,390 --> 02:36:51,230
[SPEAKER_20]: They're not as visible.

1572
02:36:51,270 --> 02:36:53,571
[SPEAKER_20]: They go out much more often.

1573
02:36:53,611 --> 02:36:59,574
[SPEAKER_20]: So usually those types of bulbs will go out every six months or so, whereas LED will last a few years and it's brighter.

1574
02:37:00,394 --> 02:37:10,687
[SPEAKER_20]: you know, something as simple as a bulb going out in a red not being visible for that one that is visible in the eastbound could be, you know, contribute to safety in a substantial way.

1575
02:37:10,747 --> 02:37:18,137
[SPEAKER_20]: So just trying to give the board and the proponent menu of options to improve safety and reduce vehicle trips.

1576
02:37:20,027 --> 02:37:21,248
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. Blake.

1577
02:37:21,628 --> 02:37:41,847
[SPEAKER_09]: So Mr. Emery, could you just go quickly through in terms of the onsite and offsite possibilities, which ones, since we are tasked as a board with making some recommendations to the ZBA, what you feel is doable here and which ones you might have issue with?

1578
02:37:45,316 --> 02:37:54,421
[SPEAKER_19]: Certainly, as I said, originally that the bicycle facilities which Todd talked about painting some of the bike lanes, some of the conflict areas.

1579
02:37:55,782 --> 02:38:04,707
[SPEAKER_19]: The bus stops there's a bench, and the pedestrian, some of the additional warning signs.

1580
02:38:05,787 --> 02:38:12,151
[SPEAKER_19]: I am not sure what this, I mean we'll certainly look into some of the additional signal heads at the Mystic Valley Parkway but

1581
02:38:13,099 --> 02:38:31,563
[SPEAKER_19]: With DCR headed toward, you know, some kind of different plan for the parkway, which probably won't happen recently, you know, short term, but maybe there's some simple improvements we can come up with to try to improve visibility of the signals there.

1582
02:38:35,593 --> 02:38:40,978
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm just not sure at this point, you know, until we sort of get into the weeds a little bit on the design, what we could do there.

1583
02:38:41,038 --> 02:38:46,443
[SPEAKER_19]: Certainly backplates, new bulbs are a little bit easier than replacing overhead.

1584
02:38:46,503 --> 02:38:55,030
[SPEAKER_19]: Once you go to overhead signals, I'm not afraid, but I know we'd have to check the mast arms to see structurally where they could hold it.

1585
02:38:59,806 --> 02:39:04,049
[SPEAKER_20]: Some other minor things I noticed is that the visors on some of the signal heads are missing.

1586
02:39:04,530 --> 02:39:08,833
[SPEAKER_20]: So that typically implies that they're getting hit when trucks take the corner.

1587
02:39:09,754 --> 02:39:17,081
[SPEAKER_20]: So, so there could be either replaced or consider repositioning a post so it doesn't get hit or protected with a bollard, things like that.

1588
02:39:18,802 --> 02:39:40,595
[SPEAKER_20]: at Boston Ave at north it's not necessarily a high crash location but there is a post that's really close to the corner that could use some protection and at that signal there's also two signal heads that still have eight inch signal lenses which is not really usable at this point anymore the 12 inches is the standard so yeah whatever

1589
02:39:41,808 --> 02:39:49,273
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know, Rod, if your team has some, or if you want to take a look at what you think you can do within the recommended amounts.

1590
02:39:51,134 --> 02:40:00,399
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Blake, would it make sense to focus on items on your list that are within Medford's jurisdiction?

1591
02:40:00,419 --> 02:40:08,925
[SPEAKER_24]: It seemed like that way the two parties could get together and decide what really makes sense to get done and know we can do it.

1592
02:40:09,883 --> 02:40:13,346
[SPEAKER_24]: as opposed to some of these other items that involve multiple jurisdictions.

1593
02:40:16,088 --> 02:40:27,238
[SPEAKER_24]: Is there enough there on Medford land that would be commensurate with the value and the size of the project that's being proposed?

1594
02:40:30,245 --> 02:40:38,688
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I don't have a detailed cost for all these but but there may be enough to to piece together to meet that proportion in the Medford on sections.

1595
02:40:38,988 --> 02:40:55,173
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean it is very peculiar how that small portion of boss nav is in Somerville, but a lot of Medford residents obviously use it coming from the West Medford side, so they traverse over that short section of Somerville, and one of the crosswalks, I believe, is in Somerville at Irving.

1596
02:40:56,773 --> 02:41:10,639
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, there was even consideration of possibly realigning those two crosswalks to be better positioned to serve the new development, especially if there's a cafe casual restaurant at the corner there.

1597
02:41:11,620 --> 02:41:21,464
[SPEAKER_20]: So, yeah, I guess the answer is there may be enough to meet those needs in the Medford portion.

1598
02:41:22,365 --> 02:41:23,165
[SPEAKER_20]: But then, you know,

1599
02:41:23,955 --> 02:41:35,282
[SPEAKER_20]: The downside would be potentially the improvements are all on one side or not necessarily equally distributed to where the trips may be equally distributed to, but.

1600
02:41:35,342 --> 02:41:43,768
[SPEAKER_25]: Can I just add that the traffic study assumes in those results that the signal timing is optimized and changed.

1601
02:41:44,268 --> 02:41:51,273
[SPEAKER_25]: So in order to get those results, we have to include signal timing updates.

1602
02:41:53,075 --> 02:41:54,356
[SPEAKER_25]: at the DCR signals.

1603
02:42:00,561 --> 02:42:15,473
[SPEAKER_25]: Rob, sorry, I missed, my internet keeps going out, so I missed part of your presentation, but I definitely think that some, I don't know what, is there any approvals that from DCR that you already have to go through?

1604
02:42:17,694 --> 02:42:19,195
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe Mike, I don't think we do.

1605
02:42:19,916 --> 02:42:20,777
[SPEAKER_19]: Not at this time, no.

1606
02:42:21,539 --> 02:42:31,342
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, I know Deanna is right about the, you know, the build analysis with mitigation, but what I was mitigating was a two or three second increase in delay.

1607
02:42:31,482 --> 02:42:38,944
[SPEAKER_19]: So it was just to show the math that we could do it with just some single timing adjustments.

1608
02:42:40,665 --> 02:42:44,986
[SPEAKER_19]: But still, the impacts are very, very minor, even without it.

1609
02:42:46,527 --> 02:42:48,807
[SPEAKER_19]: So I, you know, I'm happy to

1610
02:42:53,249 --> 02:43:00,579
[SPEAKER_19]: to DCR about it, but I'm not sure where the head is, I guess, because they're looking to do other things on the parkway.

1611
02:43:00,699 --> 02:43:05,005
[SPEAKER_19]: They discourage traffic rather than encourage it to be more efficient.

1612
02:43:07,250 --> 02:43:07,650
[SPEAKER_25]: That makes sense.

1613
02:43:07,670 --> 02:43:12,953
[SPEAKER_25]: I just wanted to point out that in order to see the changes that you present in the report.

1614
02:43:14,073 --> 02:43:18,655
[SPEAKER_19]: We did no build without the changes.

1615
02:43:18,715 --> 02:43:27,339
[SPEAKER_19]: And then we showed that in order to mitigate a three or four second delays that, you know, we can certainly make it better with just some timing changes.

1616
02:43:28,879 --> 02:43:29,880
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks for pointing it out.

1617
02:43:34,543 --> 02:43:35,703
[SPEAKER_09]: Jackie, I see you're unmuted.

1618
02:43:35,743 --> 02:43:37,004
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you like to say something?

1619
02:43:39,485 --> 02:43:39,705
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

1620
02:43:41,305 --> 02:43:43,686
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry, not at this time.

1621
02:43:43,746 --> 02:43:51,488
[SPEAKER_09]: Do any other board members want to speak up at this time before I open the public participation portion of the hearing?

1622
02:43:55,361 --> 02:44:00,024
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, why don't we open the public participation portion of the hearing.

1623
02:44:01,004 --> 02:44:09,750
[SPEAKER_09]: If any resident that would like to make a comment, please use the raise hand function at the bottom of the Zoom screen.

1624
02:44:10,290 --> 02:44:24,739
[SPEAKER_09]: You can also send an email to OCD at Medford-MA.gov and you can call, let me just get the number again.

1625
02:44:29,188 --> 02:44:30,449
[SPEAKER_09]: You can also call 781-393-2480.

1626
02:44:30,629 --> 02:44:32,811
[SPEAKER_09]: Great, I see Ken Kraus has his hand raised.

1627
02:44:32,831 --> 02:44:39,417
[SPEAKER_09]: We could unmute him, that would be great.

1628
02:44:48,579 --> 02:44:49,459
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead, Ken.

1629
02:44:49,580 --> 02:44:50,380
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1630
02:44:50,440 --> 02:44:52,481
[SPEAKER_21]: Again, Ken Kraus, 50 Mystic Street.

1631
02:44:52,981 --> 02:44:57,083
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm in support of this addition to 200 Boston Avenue.

1632
02:44:57,183 --> 02:45:03,346
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it's gonna be good for the city in terms of economic development, revenue, additional jobs in the city.

1633
02:45:03,806 --> 02:45:17,492
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'm also hoping it's a catalyst for continued planning for phase two of the Green Line extension, which is to bring a additional station just next door to this property.

1634
02:45:18,568 --> 02:45:29,270
[SPEAKER_21]: The one thing I'm concerned about a little bit from the community impact is the emission of light from the building at night.

1635
02:45:30,570 --> 02:45:41,212
[SPEAKER_21]: These life sciences companies frequently have international headquarters and partners and the lights are off and on at 200 Boston Avenue early and late.

1636
02:45:42,312 --> 02:45:45,233
[SPEAKER_21]: They're not too significant in terms of the impact of the neighborhood.

1637
02:45:46,219 --> 02:45:54,686
[SPEAKER_21]: at that side of the building because there's the commuter rail corridor, excuse me, and that walk-in court behind it.

1638
02:45:54,766 --> 02:45:56,867
[SPEAKER_21]: It's kind of set back at a lower elevation.

1639
02:45:56,928 --> 02:46:03,092
[SPEAKER_21]: But as I've pointed out, this is gonna be a significant change for the abutters across Boston Avenue.

1640
02:46:03,112 --> 02:46:10,879
[SPEAKER_21]: There's about 10 homes directly facing this and there's a low level parking deck now and one corner of it is just surface parking.

1641
02:46:10,919 --> 02:46:11,939
[SPEAKER_21]: And they're gonna have now

1642
02:46:12,980 --> 02:46:20,901
[SPEAKER_21]: a five-story wall of the building end-to-end there, which is going to pretty dramatically change the view from their perspective.

1643
02:46:20,961 --> 02:46:39,925
[SPEAKER_21]: So as this goes forward, I just hope that the planners can keep in mind keeping the light reduced that comes out of the building, whether it be shades on the windows or just the lights inside the parking area while they'll be screening, the lights will still be visible.

1644
02:46:40,045 --> 02:46:41,765
[SPEAKER_21]: So one of the

1645
02:46:42,473 --> 02:46:53,561
[SPEAKER_21]: negative things about this area is the U-Haul building for the, in terms of its impact on the neighborhood, it is extremely over-illuminated.

1646
02:46:53,581 --> 02:47:03,668
[SPEAKER_21]: If you're ever down there at night, the building, it's actually in Somerville and it's not a Cummings building, but it is grossly over-illuminated in the West Medford area.

1647
02:47:03,808 --> 02:47:09,011
[SPEAKER_21]: You can see it for blocks and this is, we don't want something anywhere near that.

1648
02:47:09,051 --> 02:47:09,872
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't think Cummings

1649
02:47:10,551 --> 02:47:11,191
[SPEAKER_21]: would do that.

1650
02:47:11,231 --> 02:47:16,412
[SPEAKER_21]: They're an excellent corporate citizen and they want to do right by the community.

1651
02:47:16,452 --> 02:47:18,272
[SPEAKER_21]: So I just hope they would keep that in mind.

1652
02:47:18,312 --> 02:47:30,075
[SPEAKER_21]: And if the community development board can make a condition of that or just an emphasis of that to minimize the emission of light from the building, particularly in the night hours.

1653
02:47:30,575 --> 02:47:30,915
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1654
02:47:34,896 --> 02:47:35,116
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

1655
02:47:35,196 --> 02:47:35,796
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Ken.

1656
02:47:38,332 --> 02:47:43,173
[SPEAKER_09]: Does anyone, can anyone on the project team speak to the light issue?

1657
02:47:43,473 --> 02:47:44,514
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's a good one.

1658
02:47:46,074 --> 02:47:47,134
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, Mr. Vaney.

1659
02:47:47,654 --> 02:47:47,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1660
02:47:48,755 --> 02:47:49,355
[SPEAKER_04]: Great point.

1661
02:47:50,295 --> 02:47:57,697
[SPEAKER_04]: So, interestingly enough, the garage for certain, we have multiple properties that have garages.

1662
02:47:58,532 --> 02:48:04,134
[SPEAKER_04]: And we set the lights up so that they're on occupancy sensors, so the lights won't be on all the time.

1663
02:48:04,554 --> 02:48:06,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody drives by and needs a light, the light will go on.

1664
02:48:07,215 --> 02:48:09,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody doesn't need the light, the light goes off.

1665
02:48:09,296 --> 02:48:18,680
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think the garage section certainly will generically be minimal, hopefully.

1666
02:48:20,065 --> 02:48:22,026
[SPEAKER_04]: The building section is very interesting.

1667
02:48:22,106 --> 02:48:29,729
[SPEAKER_04]: We can certainly work with the prospective tenants to do things like shading or I know these buildings, it's absolutely correct.

1668
02:48:29,749 --> 02:48:33,950
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of international companies and it's tough to, the buildings are open.

1669
02:48:33,970 --> 02:48:36,091
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to say that they're open 24 seven.

1670
02:48:36,211 --> 02:48:37,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Clients can use them however they want.

1671
02:48:38,092 --> 02:48:41,413
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually you get people in there at six or seven in the morning and they work till, you know,

1672
02:48:42,104 --> 02:48:43,665
[SPEAKER_04]: whenever at night that's necessary.

1673
02:48:44,145 --> 02:48:53,710
[SPEAKER_04]: We can certainly work with them when they're not there to make sure that accommodations are made so that we're not disturbing our neighbors like that, for sure.

1674
02:48:53,930 --> 02:48:55,150
[SPEAKER_04]: We're happy to work towards that.

1675
02:48:58,172 --> 02:49:00,533
[SPEAKER_09]: Could you speak a little bit more about the landscaping?

1676
02:49:00,553 --> 02:49:08,837
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm assuming that the footprint of the building is gonna match the deck that's there already.

1677
02:49:08,957 --> 02:49:10,318
[SPEAKER_09]: So you're not actually gonna

1678
02:49:10,747 --> 02:49:13,448
[SPEAKER_09]: increase the buffer, the landscape buffer, are you?

1679
02:49:13,528 --> 02:49:18,090
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know there's a couple of small kind of runtish trees there right now.

1680
02:49:18,110 --> 02:49:31,754
[SPEAKER_09]: I assume you probably have to take those out, but what's the, are you going to plant more trees as the trees could be one way of screening, excuse me, the properties across the street from that visual impact?

1681
02:49:33,315 --> 02:49:33,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

1682
02:49:34,055 --> 02:49:39,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I share my screen just to go back to one rendering?

1683
02:49:39,037 --> 02:49:39,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that okay?

1684
02:49:41,059 --> 02:49:42,480
[SPEAKER_09]: Great, Amanda, if you could do that.

1685
02:49:42,500 --> 02:49:50,126
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm so sorry.

1686
02:49:50,686 --> 02:49:53,248
[SPEAKER_11]: Mike, you have permission to share screen.

1687
02:49:53,268 --> 02:49:55,750
[SPEAKER_11]: You should choose just the window that you want.

1688
02:49:56,390 --> 02:49:56,871
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.

1689
02:49:56,911 --> 02:49:58,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you see it?

1690
02:49:59,132 --> 02:49:59,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1691
02:50:00,667 --> 02:50:03,609
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, the objective here is you're absolutely right.

1692
02:50:03,629 --> 02:50:07,811
[SPEAKER_04]: We're building within the existing footprint of the garage as it exists today.

1693
02:50:08,291 --> 02:50:17,475
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're right, there is some landscaping that goes along between the garage and the generously wide sidewalk that's there now.

1694
02:50:17,495 --> 02:50:22,518
[SPEAKER_04]: We're gonna obviously probably have some challenges with that just to get it built.

1695
02:50:23,138 --> 02:50:25,940
[SPEAKER_04]: And as you can see here, we have planted some additional trees.

1696
02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:27,460
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll replant that whole area.

1697
02:50:27,480 --> 02:50:28,521
[SPEAKER_04]: There'll be some,

1698
02:50:30,785 --> 02:50:41,349
[SPEAKER_04]: some outdoor amenity space here for whatever amenity kind of winds up utilizing the lower floor, but there will be trees along the building.

1699
02:50:42,069 --> 02:50:53,933
[SPEAKER_04]: There will potentially be any exterior lighting that we put on the building just to accentuate the lower level that's gonna be interacting with the sidewalk.

1700
02:50:54,553 --> 02:50:59,295
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll use down lights, nothing will be shining out, it'll all be shining down.

1701
02:51:01,369 --> 02:51:08,371
[SPEAKER_04]: similar to dark sky compliant lights to make sure that we're down lighting and not light polluting the area.

1702
02:51:11,532 --> 02:51:12,592
[SPEAKER_04]: If that answers your question.

1703
02:51:14,852 --> 02:51:21,714
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess I was just looking at those trees to see if they do any shading of the building, but they look pretty small there.

1704
02:51:23,575 --> 02:51:24,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are probably how we're going to buy them.

1705
02:51:25,535 --> 02:51:28,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe they're a little small when we buy them, but it won't take long before they're big.

1706
02:51:30,408 --> 02:51:36,692
[SPEAKER_24]: We like trees, and we will be generous with what we do there if this project is approved.

1707
02:51:37,593 --> 02:51:58,369
[SPEAKER_24]: Mike also recommended internally, and we've incorporated into the program, the elimination of some interior parking spaces on that north side of the building to create more green space, and maybe more equally importantly, some more patio space, outdoor recreation area, or outdoor support space for a coffee shop or a casual restaurant that we hope to attract.

1708
02:51:59,169 --> 02:52:05,816
[SPEAKER_24]: into the building and please be assured that our concept for amenity space there is neighborhood scale.

1709
02:52:06,536 --> 02:52:12,422
[SPEAKER_24]: If it's going to be successful and we want it to be successful if we build space and nobody wants to lease it, that's a failure.

1710
02:52:13,784 --> 02:52:14,725
[SPEAKER_24]: It's going to need to be

1711
02:52:15,425 --> 02:52:21,531
[SPEAKER_24]: amenities that are really attractive to people on campus, but also in the surrounding neighborhood in order to be viable.

1712
02:52:22,192 --> 02:52:26,336
[SPEAKER_24]: And if the neighborhood wants a more local flavor to it, we'd love that.

1713
02:52:26,376 --> 02:52:35,185
[SPEAKER_24]: We want to put in there whatever is going to be attractive to everybody in the area and therefore well used.

1714
02:52:36,406 --> 02:52:38,769
[SPEAKER_24]: And so that's our intent, that's our goal.

1715
02:52:41,959 --> 02:52:45,720
[SPEAKER_09]: My suggestion might be to protect that area a little bit more.

1716
02:52:48,021 --> 02:53:03,987
[SPEAKER_09]: I've seen lots of situations where you have those small outdoor patio areas along fairly busy roadways and with the noise and with full sun, they're not very pleasant places to be.

1717
02:53:04,227 --> 02:53:06,388
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you could get,

1718
02:53:07,403 --> 02:53:11,706
[SPEAKER_09]: a couple more trees over on that corner, helping to shade the patio area.

1719
02:53:11,746 --> 02:53:13,027
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that would be helpful.

1720
02:53:14,849 --> 02:53:23,975
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't know to the extent there's, you know, what you can do about the sidewalk along Boston Ave.

1721
02:53:24,075 --> 02:53:29,700
[SPEAKER_09]: I know it's a big sidewalk and it doesn't seem like it's in pretty good shape according to the city.

1722
02:53:29,780 --> 02:53:33,803
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's, you know, not full replacement, but,

1723
02:53:34,660 --> 02:53:38,703
[SPEAKER_09]: maybe fixing spots that have problems.

1724
02:53:40,304 --> 02:53:47,610
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if it's possible to put in some new tree wells along the sidewalk as well.

1725
02:53:50,733 --> 02:54:03,062
[SPEAKER_09]: The more vegetation that can kind of protect that, such a straight shot there with the traffic that really discourages, I think, a feeling of safety and the noise level when you have traffic going by at that level

1726
02:54:04,461 --> 02:54:04,881
[SPEAKER_09]: Not great.

1727
02:54:06,382 --> 02:54:07,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Duly noted, thank you.

1728
02:54:08,883 --> 02:54:15,306
[SPEAKER_04]: There are some existing trees that are in the sidewalk that are not shown on that rendering.

1729
02:54:16,426 --> 02:54:19,227
[SPEAKER_04]: There's three of them, three sizable trees that will remain.

1730
02:54:20,948 --> 02:54:25,550
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can absolutely extend the tree wells on that as well.

1731
02:54:26,290 --> 02:54:32,853
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, fill those gaps in with some trees in the 15 foot setback area.

1732
02:54:35,578 --> 02:54:42,747
[SPEAKER_11]: And may I just sorry, Andre, this is Alicia director just because it's part of this conversation.

1733
02:54:42,768 --> 02:54:53,321
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, if we're putting some shouting down some notes about a condition around trees, and what I would recommend is that

1734
02:54:55,050 --> 02:55:03,735
[SPEAKER_11]: consultation with our tree warden, who is really an expert on right tree, right place, to talk about appropriate height.

1735
02:55:04,955 --> 02:55:13,720
[SPEAKER_11]: What height would the trees grow to without having concern about disrupting the sidewalk?

1736
02:55:15,001 --> 02:55:23,145
[SPEAKER_11]: And I am pleased to hear you say that you want to keep the sidewalk trees that are there and you don't feel that they're in the way of the construction.

1737
02:55:24,038 --> 02:55:47,361
[SPEAKER_11]: and I might consult with Tim and Todd on this, whether if they were, if the company was amenable, if there was space, because I can see that too close to the road is a problem, too close to the building is a problem, but to consult with our staff and the tree warden on whether additional sidewalk trees would work on that sidewalk since it's so large.

1738
02:55:48,002 --> 02:55:49,722
[SPEAKER_11]: and that that might help.

1739
02:55:50,143 --> 02:55:54,704
[SPEAKER_11]: Could we put larger trees if they were next to the road versus next to the building?

1740
02:55:54,724 --> 02:55:57,605
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, is that something that we could consider there?

1741
02:56:01,226 --> 02:56:02,306
[SPEAKER_04]: We're certainly open to that.

1742
02:56:07,707 --> 02:56:08,968
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1743
02:56:08,988 --> 02:56:09,608
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have

1744
02:56:11,209 --> 02:56:23,172
[SPEAKER_09]: There's going to be striping, I guess, on the side streets along Boston Ave, and there are existing ramps there cutting across those entryways.

1745
02:56:23,932 --> 02:56:26,232
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I haven't looked at that closely.

1746
02:56:27,593 --> 02:56:31,073
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, do you mean their driveways, or are you talking about the side streets?

1747
02:56:31,133 --> 02:56:33,794
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think their driveways.

1748
02:56:34,474 --> 02:56:37,835
[SPEAKER_11]: The driveways into the 200 at Boston Ave area?

1749
02:56:38,335 --> 02:56:38,495
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1750
02:56:40,349 --> 02:56:44,330
[SPEAKER_11]: So I mean, all sidewalks would need to be ADA compliant.

1751
02:56:45,711 --> 02:56:52,073
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, so they're at like level grade with the sidewalks on either end or are there ramps?

1752
02:56:54,894 --> 02:56:56,635
[SPEAKER_04]: The sidewalks dive right into it.

1753
02:56:56,675 --> 02:57:01,697
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's all, I actually went out there with the SMART level.

1754
02:57:02,859 --> 02:57:12,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Monday night, and they're all within the mass AAB percent that they can be.

1755
02:57:13,804 --> 02:57:17,145
[SPEAKER_04]: There are some slight drops, but it's all kind of level.

1756
02:57:17,225 --> 02:57:19,146
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all nice, goes up, well, less than 2%.

1757
02:57:19,246 --> 02:57:25,048
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, actually, I'm looking at it right now on Street View, Google Street View.

1758
02:57:26,169 --> 02:57:26,809
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, yeah.

1759
02:57:29,450 --> 02:57:31,931
[SPEAKER_09]: I can actually show folks if they just want to see it real quick.

1760
02:57:35,078 --> 02:57:38,719
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. Chair, if I may.

1761
02:57:38,779 --> 02:57:40,800
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, go ahead, Mr. Blake.

1762
02:57:41,400 --> 02:57:58,445
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, so as you're depicting in the street view, what Tim had mentioned earlier is for most projects now, we either want them to continue the sidewalk treatment, so cement concrete with a driveway apron across, much like the Locust Street project,

1763
02:57:59,185 --> 02:58:09,196
[SPEAKER_20]: or if it's kept this way where the asphalt pavement is the driveway, and you have ramp on either side, then you would paint the crosswalk across the driveway as if it were a street.

1764
02:58:09,577 --> 02:58:20,589
[SPEAKER_20]: So one of those two, if it stayed like this, it would have a painted crosswalk, or you could construct it in such a way it looks like a continuous version of the sidewalk.

1765
02:58:23,374 --> 02:58:36,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and today those sidewalks that the apron is compliant, so I think I would probably leave it there, and I think the crosswalk's not a bad idea, and it'll also help the traffic calming as well.

1766
02:58:40,309 --> 02:58:41,670
[SPEAKER_18]: Can I ask a question on this view?

1767
02:58:42,611 --> 02:58:43,412
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, absolutely.

1768
02:58:44,513 --> 02:58:46,534
[SPEAKER_18]: So where would the proposed

1769
02:58:47,905 --> 02:58:53,208
[SPEAKER_18]: building phase B in relation to what we're seeing the face of the garages today?

1770
02:58:55,229 --> 02:58:56,349
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty much the same spot.

1771
02:58:58,210 --> 02:59:01,392
[SPEAKER_18]: Same spot, so the same, you'd have the same buffer strip.

1772
02:59:02,112 --> 02:59:03,493
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's about 15 feet.

1773
02:59:05,014 --> 02:59:06,875
[SPEAKER_04]: From the curb or from the sidewalk?

1774
02:59:08,436 --> 02:59:11,137
[SPEAKER_04]: From the property line, which I believe is the back of the sidewalk.

1775
02:59:17,512 --> 02:59:21,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so that dimension between the back of the sidewalk and the face of the building is 15 feet.

1776
02:59:23,557 --> 02:59:24,598
[SPEAKER_18]: And that would be maintained.

1777
02:59:25,439 --> 02:59:25,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.

1778
02:59:27,341 --> 02:59:29,542
[SPEAKER_24]: And here's one of the street trees we were talking about.

1779
02:59:29,562 --> 02:59:31,504
[SPEAKER_24]: Sorry, Mr. Clark, go ahead.

1780
02:59:33,043 --> 02:59:39,405
[SPEAKER_24]: It's probably worth pointing out that our plan involves recycling most of that parking structure.

1781
02:59:40,185 --> 02:59:44,727
[SPEAKER_24]: A lot of firms might come in and just knock it down and ship it off and start over again.

1782
02:59:45,607 --> 02:59:53,609
[SPEAKER_24]: But we think the most efficient and sustainable, cost efficient, sustainable way to do this project is to recycle most of the existing structure.

1783
02:59:54,090 --> 03:00:01,172
[SPEAKER_24]: And that's why the footprint is the footprint with the exception of the modest demolition on the cell side.

1784
03:00:02,052 --> 03:00:04,474
[SPEAKER_24]: that Mr. Avani mentioned earlier in his presentation.

1785
03:00:09,958 --> 03:00:15,282
[SPEAKER_18]: But you're going to have to excavate out for your spread footings, right?

1786
03:00:17,764 --> 03:00:19,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike and Brian, can you speak to that?

1787
03:00:20,666 --> 03:00:21,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, within the setback.

1788
03:00:22,707 --> 03:00:23,848
[SPEAKER_04]: But they'll be below ground.

1789
03:00:26,590 --> 03:00:28,491
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's going to be a lot of internal footings, too.

1790
03:00:30,237 --> 03:00:31,118
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, you know what?

1791
03:00:31,218 --> 03:00:32,799
[SPEAKER_04]: And Brian, you can help me out here.

1792
03:00:33,560 --> 03:00:39,004
[SPEAKER_04]: The perimeter footings that are there now will remain untouched.

1793
03:00:39,445 --> 03:00:52,675
[SPEAKER_04]: We're gonna come in, it might be 10 feet, and then do another row of footings inside there so that the tributary load for that last 10 feet, it's only about five feet of it that's gonna be in the existing footings.

1794
03:00:53,016 --> 03:00:56,919
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we have a scheme where we can leave the existing footings and not excavate around the perimeter.

1795
03:00:59,460 --> 03:01:00,020
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, Mike.

1796
03:01:00,440 --> 03:01:01,661
[SPEAKER_01]: That's correct.

1797
03:01:01,821 --> 03:01:05,862
[SPEAKER_01]: And the board can see that indicated on the plans that were submitted.

1798
03:01:06,642 --> 03:01:15,065
[SPEAKER_01]: Columns marked in red are new, which require new footings, but that's in board of the current perimeter of the garage.

1799
03:01:18,246 --> 03:01:18,366
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.

1800
03:01:18,386 --> 03:01:19,126
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1801
03:01:22,027 --> 03:01:24,768
[SPEAKER_09]: It's great to hear that you're going to be reusing a lot of that.

1802
03:01:31,021 --> 03:01:31,401
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1803
03:01:32,162 --> 03:01:33,763
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Blake, you raise your hand again.

1804
03:01:35,524 --> 03:01:36,584
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chair.

1805
03:01:36,604 --> 03:01:42,828
[SPEAKER_20]: I just wanted to circle back to something Dennis had asked in terms of possible traffic mitigation within the city.

1806
03:01:43,889 --> 03:01:57,798
[SPEAKER_20]: Looking at it some more, if the proponent wanted to offer something like extending the enhanced bicycle lane conflict markings and super share treatments beyond what was originally recommended,

1807
03:01:58,478 --> 03:02:10,625
[SPEAKER_20]: To, you know, up to say Winthrop Street or even as far as the Green Line station or across, you know, it's West Medford, you probably could achieve the level of improvements in Medford own property.

1808
03:02:11,460 --> 03:02:32,810
[SPEAKER_20]: So say for instance, the green markings at all the conflict points on the side streets and super shares were extended all the way up to say the Green Line extension station, the new one, then that would definitely enhance and increase the likelihood of people cycling from that area to the site or vice versa.

1809
03:02:37,693 --> 03:02:46,103
[SPEAKER_20]: So the answer is it could reach the recommended proportion within Medford if the board decided to go that route with those types of improvements.

1810
03:02:48,766 --> 03:02:54,152
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you explain Mr. Blake, just a super shallow, what that would entail?

1811
03:02:55,071 --> 03:03:12,447
[SPEAKER_20]: Sure, so the uphill as, as all of you likely know, the uphill direction of Boston have has a bike lane, separate from the traveling, but in the downhill direction has sheroes, indicating that cyclists are allowed to travel within the lane and drivers should be aware of them.

1812
03:03:12,888 --> 03:03:15,890
[SPEAKER_20]: So right now the shares are painted as white markings.

1813
03:03:16,711 --> 03:03:22,533
[SPEAKER_20]: in a super share would be the same marking, but with a green box background underneath it.

1814
03:03:22,993 --> 03:03:26,154
[SPEAKER_20]: So it really stands out and pops in the roadway.

1815
03:03:26,174 --> 03:03:37,758
[SPEAKER_20]: A local example is on Curtis Street in Somerville right up over the hill from Winthrop Street Medford, you go up over the hill into Somerville, down by Raymond and Curtis and Paros Boulevard they have some.

1816
03:03:38,638 --> 03:03:56,598
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's just a, it's just a green background underneath the white shero, and it's a square, and it's just meant to highlight it even more so than it is now to remind drivers to be aware of cyclists in the roadway with them.

1817
03:04:02,339 --> 03:04:13,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think that's a fantastic suggestion, and I think it's something we'd be happy to consider and work with Todd and the engineering department on something like that.

1818
03:04:16,483 --> 03:04:30,067
[SPEAKER_20]: I think the Medford Bicycle Commission has been asking for introducing elements like these at the conflict points at crossing streets and super sharos like that to make it in areas where we can't fit a bike lane.

1819
03:04:34,508 --> 03:04:47,709
[SPEAKER_09]: And Mr. Blake, I mean, like looking at this right here, see if somebody is even in this picture parked in the bike lane, you think it's, well, I don't know if it's.

1820
03:04:48,549 --> 03:04:50,430
[SPEAKER_09]: There's the bike lane there.

1821
03:04:50,470 --> 03:04:52,070
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that a bike lane or is that parking?

1822
03:04:52,131 --> 03:04:53,051
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't really get it.

1823
03:04:53,511 --> 03:04:57,653
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Chair, on that side of the street, I believe that's parking.

1824
03:04:57,713 --> 03:05:09,198
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have sharrows, the indicators, as Mr. Blake said, that bicycles are cycling in the travel lane and on the opposite side of the street, southbound, you have a dedicated bike lane.

1825
03:05:12,219 --> 03:05:14,700
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the dedicated bike lane, isn't it?

1826
03:05:15,208 --> 03:05:16,429
[SPEAKER_20]: That's the parking shoulder.

1827
03:05:16,489 --> 03:05:18,890
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the parking shoulder, and this is the bike lane?

1828
03:05:18,910 --> 03:05:19,690
[SPEAKER_20]: Correct.

1829
03:05:20,511 --> 03:05:21,011
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

1830
03:05:22,051 --> 03:05:38,239
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it almost makes more sense to get rid of the parking lane and make this the bike lane and have some level of protection here with the, not like permanent bollards, but you know, at least some like flags or something you can put in there.

1831
03:05:39,107 --> 03:05:45,528
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, the city's open to exploring things like that but that would involve traffic commission removal of the part on street parking.

1832
03:05:47,009 --> 03:06:00,472
[SPEAKER_20]: So, working within when when this, this was a complete streets project in 2017 and, and to add these bicycle combinations, without impacting a whole side of Boston have parking.

1833
03:06:01,172 --> 03:06:04,994
[SPEAKER_20]: it was able to fit the uphill bike lane and downhill share.

1834
03:06:05,314 --> 03:06:09,936
[SPEAKER_20]: That's the same treatment that's going in a high street near the Brooks School of Safe Routes to School project.

1835
03:06:10,256 --> 03:06:27,784
[SPEAKER_20]: So whenever there's not necessarily a clear choice or enough space to allocate two bike lanes, the preference is the bike lane in the uphill direction because the bikes are slower and out of the stream of the traveling, whereas if it's downhill,

1836
03:06:30,933 --> 03:06:38,975
[SPEAKER_17]: And then there's no on street parking that really exists for the residents in that area because almost every street except for North Street is permit parking, correct?

1837
03:06:39,056 --> 03:06:45,818
[SPEAKER_17]: And if I'm not mistaken, I do believe that the other choices have been 200 Boston Ave parking garage.

1838
03:06:45,838 --> 03:06:50,139
[SPEAKER_17]: You've been very generous in allowing residents in Boston Ave to park there.

1839
03:06:50,199 --> 03:06:51,619
[SPEAKER_17]: I was part of that when I lived at 258.

1840
03:06:51,659 --> 03:06:51,879
[SPEAKER_17]: So I

1841
03:06:55,020 --> 03:07:05,014
[SPEAKER_17]: I was just making that note about restructuring that parking there, but also notate in that the parking was at your place.

1842
03:07:08,068 --> 03:07:18,557
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'm wondering also on this corner, just looking at the bus, the bus stop and then, you know, hopefully there will be more people using the bus stop when your development happens.

1843
03:07:19,698 --> 03:07:30,407
[SPEAKER_09]: If there's an opportunity as you're redesigning this area to make it so that people waiting for the bus have some place to, you know, get out of the weather or sit down.

1844
03:07:33,670 --> 03:07:35,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, one of the, one of the,

1845
03:07:37,893 --> 03:07:42,118
[SPEAKER_04]: recommendations, one of Todd's recommendations was to add benches there.

1846
03:07:42,178 --> 03:07:45,601
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is something that we'd be happy to do.

1847
03:07:45,882 --> 03:07:52,909
[SPEAKER_04]: And there is gonna be some hardscape in that area, again, that will have benches and shade and people could sit there.

1848
03:07:53,249 --> 03:07:58,335
[SPEAKER_04]: As a matter of fact, in this rendering that I had shared with you, there's a parking, there's a bench right in front of the bus stop.

1849
03:08:04,597 --> 03:08:06,586
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't see any other comments from members of the public.

1850
03:08:06,807 --> 03:08:07,892
[SPEAKER_09]: Amanda, have you gotten anything?

1851
03:08:08,993 --> 03:08:15,835
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, I had a call-in comment from Tina Rapatino from 81 Marshall Street.

1852
03:08:16,576 --> 03:08:18,036
[SPEAKER_22]: She had two kind of points.

1853
03:08:18,516 --> 03:08:20,797
[SPEAKER_22]: The first was a concern for noise.

1854
03:08:22,198 --> 03:08:26,899
[SPEAKER_22]: There's an existing level of noise that impacts residents already.

1855
03:08:27,800 --> 03:08:33,401
[SPEAKER_22]: She believes it may be from existing AC or heat coming out of buildings.

1856
03:08:33,782 --> 03:08:36,362
[SPEAKER_22]: And she's wondering if the proponent would consider

1857
03:08:37,963 --> 03:08:45,789
[SPEAKER_22]: any efforts to mitigate existing noise that's already impacting residents and also to address noise concerns moving forward.

1858
03:08:46,870 --> 03:09:01,402
[SPEAKER_22]: The second half of her comment had to do with is there and maybe this would be addressed by explaining a little bit the nature of the work of potential tenants that would be moving into this facility.

1859
03:09:01,522 --> 03:09:03,924
[SPEAKER_22]: But would there be anything that

1860
03:09:04,565 --> 03:09:16,637
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, anyone that comes in that would potentially add to exhaust or air pollution or, um, just generally a concern for hazardous materials in the area that may impact surrounding residents.

1861
03:09:27,304 --> 03:09:27,965
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, please.

1862
03:09:28,206 --> 03:09:30,090
[SPEAKER_09]: Either one of you.

1863
03:09:30,110 --> 03:09:31,594
[SPEAKER_24]: Interesting comment about the

1864
03:09:37,572 --> 03:09:39,513
[SPEAKER_04]: the rooftop equipment and noises.

1865
03:09:40,094 --> 03:09:49,782
[SPEAKER_04]: When we did the addition in 2011, we heard the same thing and we had city officials come out and it was determined it wasn't coming from our building.

1866
03:09:50,602 --> 03:09:51,823
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's interesting.

1867
03:09:51,843 --> 03:09:54,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there will be rooftop equipment there.

1868
03:09:55,126 --> 03:09:57,848
[SPEAKER_04]: We will encourage low zone fans, obviously.

1869
03:09:58,148 --> 03:10:05,354
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we have to do some screening or if we have to have the clients do some screening to direct the noise straight up and out of

1870
03:10:06,375 --> 03:10:09,717
[SPEAKER_04]: out of the direction of the neighbors where we're comfortable with that.

1871
03:10:11,919 --> 03:10:24,148
[SPEAKER_24]: We've just gone as the operators of the existing building, whether or not we end up getting approved for this expansion and build it or not, we want to relate to neighbors that have concerns about operations.

1872
03:10:24,168 --> 03:10:30,012
[SPEAKER_24]: So if you want to put her directly in touch with me, be happy to talk to her more specifically.

1873
03:10:30,572 --> 03:10:33,974
[SPEAKER_24]: Also, we want to understand what she's hearing.

1874
03:10:37,190 --> 03:10:38,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

1875
03:10:38,971 --> 03:10:40,011
[SPEAKER_04]: Much better answer, Dennis.

1876
03:10:40,031 --> 03:10:40,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.

1877
03:10:42,612 --> 03:10:49,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Regarding the hazardous materials and the pollution, again, this is going to be a continuation of what happens in that building now.

1878
03:10:50,295 --> 03:10:52,956
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't anticipate this building is not

1879
03:10:54,028 --> 03:11:01,750
[SPEAKER_04]: does not have any from what I understand, no bio level three or four users at all.

1880
03:11:02,250 --> 03:11:11,033
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's nothing really in there that's, it's all bio, most of the science in there is bio related, not heavy on chemicals or

1881
03:11:12,173 --> 03:11:14,876
[SPEAKER_04]: other pollutants, and that's how we kind of see this going.

1882
03:11:14,916 --> 03:11:16,277
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how the science is now.

1883
03:11:17,278 --> 03:11:19,920
[SPEAKER_04]: The building is not overloaded with hazardous materials.

1884
03:11:19,960 --> 03:11:24,264
[SPEAKER_04]: There's specific rules and regulations on that that we're in compliance with as well.

1885
03:11:26,546 --> 03:11:34,933
[SPEAKER_24]: I'll add that we as a company have almost 35 years of experience specifically with life science companies as clients.

1886
03:11:35,622 --> 03:11:43,788
[SPEAKER_24]: About 2 million square feet of our total portfolio is occupied by life science companies and also pharmaceutical, meditech, and healthcare.

1887
03:11:44,428 --> 03:11:51,393
[SPEAKER_24]: And in our experience, there's some of the most heavily regulated industries out there at both the state and the federal level.

1888
03:11:52,313 --> 03:12:01,895
[SPEAKER_24]: And most of our buildings are multi-tenanted, so you can have a variety of mixed uses, tenancies right next to each other on the same floor and sharing party walls.

1889
03:12:02,236 --> 03:12:10,378
[SPEAKER_24]: You can have an accounting firm, a law firm, general business office, bank, or a restaurant right next door to any of these science-based companies.

1890
03:12:10,998 --> 03:12:15,799
[SPEAKER_24]: And to date, we have not had a health-related problem in any of our buildings.

1891
03:12:16,659 --> 03:12:20,260
[SPEAKER_24]: And again, as long-term operators, we are completely invested

1892
03:12:20,960 --> 03:12:23,082
[SPEAKER_24]: and the operation of our properties.

1893
03:12:23,142 --> 03:12:28,847
[SPEAKER_24]: We don't build them and sell them to somebody else and walk away and let problems be somebody else's.

1894
03:12:28,887 --> 03:12:32,811
[SPEAKER_24]: So we try our very best to be thoughtful and responsible about what we do.

1895
03:12:32,851 --> 03:12:35,293
[SPEAKER_24]: We make mistakes, everybody does, we miss things.

1896
03:12:35,967 --> 03:12:40,729
[SPEAKER_24]: But then we, you know, it's not what happens, it's what do you do about it when things go sideways.

1897
03:12:41,129 --> 03:12:45,331
[SPEAKER_24]: And we've never sold a commercial building in the 50 years that the company's operated.

1898
03:12:45,391 --> 03:12:53,495
[SPEAKER_24]: I can't sit here and say that will never happen, but the track record to date is we're long only as real estate investors and operators.

1899
03:12:54,035 --> 03:13:03,339
[SPEAKER_24]: So we would, and again, we would be happy to relate to city officials or any members of the public about any of these questions, you know, tonight and any other time.

1900
03:13:05,312 --> 03:13:08,293
[SPEAKER_24]: We're here, we're local, we're hands on.

1901
03:13:08,373 --> 03:13:21,015
[SPEAKER_24]: And let me also say in case I don't get another chance, I just wanted to thank everybody for investing the time that you have in reviewing this project before tonight's meeting and then discussing it here.

1902
03:13:21,115 --> 03:13:22,595
[SPEAKER_24]: We appreciate all the feedback.

1903
03:13:22,695 --> 03:13:23,995
[SPEAKER_24]: We appreciate your earnestness.

1904
03:13:24,555 --> 03:13:28,496
[SPEAKER_24]: This project's only gonna happen if you all think that it should happen.

1905
03:13:28,576 --> 03:13:29,436
[SPEAKER_24]: We respect that.

1906
03:13:30,036 --> 03:13:33,437
[SPEAKER_24]: We appreciate that and we're listening.

1907
03:13:34,077 --> 03:13:34,677
[SPEAKER_24]: So thank you.

1908
03:13:36,342 --> 03:13:37,183
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. Clark.

1909
03:13:38,985 --> 03:13:41,307
[SPEAKER_09]: Bedford economic development director Victor Schrader.

1910
03:13:42,188 --> 03:13:44,490
[SPEAKER_09]: You have, I think, something to say about this topic.

1911
03:13:45,331 --> 03:13:46,452
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, I thank you chair.

1912
03:13:47,694 --> 03:13:58,505
[SPEAKER_23]: I just thought it would be helpful for the board to know that the Board of Health is reviewing a set of regulations related to biotech and lab uses in in the city so.

1913
03:14:00,594 --> 03:14:25,035
[SPEAKER_23]: As, as Dennis mentioned, these are heavy very heavily regulated industries at the federal level but at the, at the moment we don't have any requirements that they register with the city and report to an oversight board of any kind so we're hoping to get some, some regulations in place that aren't onerous but, but do require folks to touch base with the city before they operate in the community.

1914
03:14:32,796 --> 03:14:34,476
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see, Amanda, are you getting another comment?

1915
03:14:37,037 --> 03:14:41,139
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's say for her, it looks like she is the only reason she'd be on the phone right now.

1916
03:14:43,199 --> 03:14:44,179
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks like a telephone.

1917
03:14:46,120 --> 03:14:50,682
[SPEAKER_11]: We put out a phone number so people watching TV can actually call in.

1918
03:14:50,702 --> 03:14:51,462
[SPEAKER_09]: Make donations.

1919
03:14:53,143 --> 03:15:02,912
[SPEAKER_09]: But while we wait for that, then let me just go back to the board members and ask if anybody has further feedback or questions that they want to raise.

1920
03:15:06,055 --> 03:15:10,599
[SPEAKER_25]: I just want to say that I agreed with Todd and all of those suggestions are great.

1921
03:15:11,100 --> 03:15:13,762
[SPEAKER_25]: And that there's only, I know there's only so much we can require.

1922
03:15:13,782 --> 03:15:17,426
[SPEAKER_25]: I just, some of the,

1923
03:15:18,758 --> 03:15:27,142
[SPEAKER_25]: level of service numbers in the report are pretty concerning, and the optimized numbers are much better.

1924
03:15:27,222 --> 03:15:28,742
[SPEAKER_25]: So I don't know if there's another way.

1925
03:15:30,763 --> 03:15:43,849
[SPEAKER_25]: Like if you look at Boston Ave, the westbound left through right lane under build conditions with no optimization, it's level of service F, 80 seconds delay with improvements.

1926
03:15:44,569 --> 03:15:47,971
[SPEAKER_25]: It's 36.9 seconds of delay at level of service D.

1927
03:15:48,952 --> 03:15:56,376
[SPEAKER_25]: So even though the overall intersection may be only a few seconds improvement, some of the approaches are pretty significant.

1928
03:15:56,436 --> 03:16:06,021
[SPEAKER_25]: And I think that the added traffic without changing any of the timing will really make the cues in the delay much worse.

1929
03:16:06,081 --> 03:16:11,363
[SPEAKER_25]: But maybe there's another way that that can be improved.

1930
03:16:13,324 --> 03:16:13,945
[SPEAKER_25]: I just wanted to say that.

1931
03:16:15,260 --> 03:16:29,610
[SPEAKER_17]: And I just wanted to piggyback off that DNA I'm not sure if you lost your internet it's time that I was I'm not a traffic engineer but I know a lot about traffic engineering right through traffic engineers and that was where I was going with that information earlier and so I would be.

1932
03:16:31,809 --> 03:16:43,724
[SPEAKER_17]: I would, I would look to persons like Deanna and your own traffic engineers and even mascot engineers or DCR someone with that expertise to tell me what those mitigated effects would result in.

1933
03:16:43,824 --> 03:16:49,551
[SPEAKER_17]: So, and it sounds like we're getting there with with our engineers Todd Blake.

1934
03:16:51,761 --> 03:16:56,529
[SPEAKER_17]: I guess I would just go along with some of those options that you have for mitigation.

1935
03:16:56,569 --> 03:17:02,218
[SPEAKER_17]: That's all I was trying to get to early, because I knew that it could not be a level service of A on its own.

1936
03:17:07,579 --> 03:17:21,607
[SPEAKER_09]: Although we perhaps can't condition anything based on DCR, we would encourage you to at least open a dialogue with them to see if there's some progress that can be made.

1937
03:17:22,988 --> 03:17:23,748
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Andre.

1938
03:17:24,088 --> 03:17:25,209
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's where I was going with it.

1939
03:17:25,269 --> 03:17:27,210
[SPEAKER_17]: Just be open to the dialogue.

1940
03:17:30,598 --> 03:17:37,911
[SPEAKER_09]: Getting back to the light question because I do think that this is something that could be problematic for the the homes across the street.

1941
03:17:42,454 --> 03:17:43,595
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you dealt with this before?

1942
03:17:43,615 --> 03:17:46,056
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, there's a lot of glass on that building.

1943
03:17:46,376 --> 03:17:53,819
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a way of getting a certain kind of glass that limits the light emissions?

1944
03:17:55,179 --> 03:18:00,241
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not an architect myself, so I can't speak to specific materials, but perhaps you could.

1945
03:18:02,542 --> 03:18:06,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, there's definitely, there is a lot of glass in the building.

1946
03:18:06,804 --> 03:18:09,465
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of it's spandrel glass, if you really look at the,

1947
03:18:11,547 --> 03:18:13,308
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd say a third of it's spandrel glass.

1948
03:18:13,809 --> 03:18:16,692
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's some shades that could be used.

1949
03:18:18,454 --> 03:18:21,096
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know that you get the glass to change color.

1950
03:18:21,136 --> 03:18:23,599
[SPEAKER_04]: That might be a little challenging.

1951
03:18:23,879 --> 03:18:32,288
[SPEAKER_04]: We could certainly look into some constructed options to take it out of the tenant's hands if that's a possibility.

1952
03:18:32,768 --> 03:18:34,270
[SPEAKER_04]: We'd be open to looking at it deeper.

1953
03:18:35,930 --> 03:18:40,653
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and can you explain for someone who doesn't know that material, spandrel glass, what is that?

1954
03:18:42,475 --> 03:18:43,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, absolutely.

1955
03:18:43,195 --> 03:18:47,498
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to share my screen again one more time, if that's okay.

1956
03:18:48,859 --> 03:18:49,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody see that?

1957
03:18:49,880 --> 03:18:58,046
[SPEAKER_04]: So these pieces of glass at the low part here, at the bottom of each window panel, these are spandrel glass.

1958
03:18:58,066 --> 03:19:00,247
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't see through them, so light won't come through those.

1959
03:19:00,287 --> 03:19:02,969
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, about two thirds of this panel

1960
03:19:04,819 --> 03:19:08,460
[SPEAKER_04]: light will pass through, but at the bottom it won't.

1961
03:19:08,500 --> 03:19:16,142
[SPEAKER_04]: So there is a lot of glass there for effect, but it's not all visual, all this corner, there's a lot of visual glass.

1962
03:19:16,182 --> 03:19:21,664
[SPEAKER_04]: So yes, we can continue to look at how we can mitigate that potential issue.

1963
03:19:26,052 --> 03:19:26,993
[SPEAKER_17]: Andre, this is Jackie.

1964
03:19:27,133 --> 03:19:30,736
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd be curious to know what Clace felt about that.

1965
03:19:31,636 --> 03:19:35,179
[SPEAKER_17]: Clace, not to call you out, but we do have an architect on it.

1966
03:19:35,319 --> 03:19:42,624
[SPEAKER_09]: Clace, do you want to, can you say anything about that issue?

1967
03:19:43,064 --> 03:19:54,532
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I mean, spandrel glass is very commonly used, and I think, you know, their way out of the building facade seems to be totally in keeping with

1968
03:19:56,923 --> 03:20:04,466
[SPEAKER_18]: the design of the adjacent building and, you know, it seems appropriate to me.

1969
03:20:04,486 --> 03:20:08,928
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm a hypocrite, saying I don't like it because I use it all the time.

1970
03:20:11,949 --> 03:20:18,572
[SPEAKER_18]: But I think, yeah, for me, the biggest thing is the facade.

1971
03:20:18,652 --> 03:20:24,535
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think in a way, I wish there was a way to step the facade back.

1972
03:20:25,584 --> 03:20:34,369
[SPEAKER_18]: maybe even just visually instead of actually physically to create a more recessed feel to the upper floors.

1973
03:20:34,409 --> 03:20:50,377
[SPEAKER_18]: And I don't know if that means, you know, looking at the more traditional mill aesthetic for the first three floors and doing something much more simple and monotone color for the upper floor so that they recede and don't seem as,

1974
03:20:52,135 --> 03:20:54,256
[SPEAKER_18]: overwhelming to the street edge.

1975
03:20:54,276 --> 03:20:56,696
[SPEAKER_18]: That's just a suggestion, I don't know.

1976
03:20:58,737 --> 03:21:12,121
[SPEAKER_18]: I did have another question though, which was, are you pursuing any kind of LEED certification or sustainability measurement in the building?

1977
03:21:13,041 --> 03:21:14,082
[SPEAKER_04]: A good question.

1978
03:21:14,422 --> 03:21:20,564
[SPEAKER_04]: We will obviously build this to all current codes and all stretch code requirements.

1979
03:21:22,031 --> 03:21:24,954
[SPEAKER_04]: We typically build to lead standards.

1980
03:21:24,974 --> 03:21:27,517
[SPEAKER_04]: We try to source everything as local as possible.

1981
03:21:27,977 --> 03:21:32,943
[SPEAKER_04]: We could probably get to that point, but we never go for the certification.

1982
03:21:33,063 --> 03:21:33,964
[SPEAKER_04]: We typically don't.

1983
03:21:36,138 --> 03:21:43,420
[SPEAKER_04]: but I feel like we would be able to get that certification if we so desired.

1984
03:21:45,541 --> 03:21:52,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Our experiences, we've never had a client come up to us and say, oh, we really can't lease this building because it's not LEED certified.

1985
03:21:52,483 --> 03:22:03,047
[SPEAKER_04]: It just hasn't been as much as it's important to build it to that level, but it hasn't been the marketing tool that I think it may or may not be presented as.

1986
03:22:05,943 --> 03:22:09,025
[SPEAKER_11]: So I have a question with regards to the interior lighting.

1987
03:22:09,045 --> 03:22:14,989
[SPEAKER_11]: You had said that you could easily commit to occupancy sensors in the garage because that is your standard.

1988
03:22:15,510 --> 03:22:24,896
[SPEAKER_11]: Could you commit to occupancy sensors in the public areas, sorry, within the commercial portion of the building?

1989
03:22:25,924 --> 03:22:35,669
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't remember if this corner piece was a public space, like a lobby and stairwell, or if that's a leased space in the corner.

1990
03:22:36,830 --> 03:22:44,814
[SPEAKER_11]: But I could imagine the difference between it glowing all evening and all night versus the occupants leave, there's nobody there and the lights turn out.

1991
03:22:46,355 --> 03:22:53,898
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so your comment, this is not a public space at this point in time.

1992
03:22:53,918 --> 03:22:55,659
[SPEAKER_04]: We expect that to be part of the lease space.

1993
03:22:56,019 --> 03:23:00,521
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are requirements in the energy code that there are occupancy sensors.

1994
03:23:00,561 --> 03:23:04,883
[SPEAKER_04]: So we will, these buildings will be filled with occupancy sensors.

1995
03:23:04,903 --> 03:23:12,386
[SPEAKER_04]: So theoretically, someone would have to make a concerted effort to override them if they wanted to keep their lights on all night.

1996
03:23:12,446 --> 03:23:15,547
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would hope they wouldn't, because it's not beneficial to anybody.

1997
03:23:17,243 --> 03:23:20,689
[SPEAKER_11]: And there was concern about if occupants were there all night.

1998
03:23:21,050 --> 03:23:29,003
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think there's also more tolerance for there are people there versus it's empty and shining into people's apartments.

1999
03:23:29,788 --> 03:23:30,928
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's one other comment.

2000
03:23:30,988 --> 03:23:34,510
[SPEAKER_11]: There had been a comment about the roof would be solar ready.

2001
03:23:35,110 --> 03:23:46,314
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe you're aware of Medford solar ordinance requiring both the assessment and if the assessment says that solar is suitable to install solar, a certain amount of solar on the roof of the building.

2002
03:23:47,835 --> 03:23:51,356
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm anticipating that there would be solar on this building.

2003
03:23:52,357 --> 03:23:53,017
[SPEAKER_24]: Fine by us.

2004
03:23:55,338 --> 03:24:04,863
[SPEAKER_24]: We are routinely doing solar at our buildings where it makes sense, especially on parking garages because you don't compete for roof space with mechanical equipment.

2005
03:24:05,423 --> 03:24:11,446
[SPEAKER_24]: And we, in fact, do our own design build, our own electricians are intimately involved in our solar.

2006
03:24:11,526 --> 03:24:16,068
[SPEAKER_24]: We're one of the largest private solar developers in the area.

2007
03:24:16,488 --> 03:24:17,928
[SPEAKER_24]: So yes, we believe in that.

2008
03:24:18,329 --> 03:24:18,689
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2009
03:24:19,522 --> 03:24:19,883
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

2010
03:24:20,444 --> 03:24:24,272
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that was a comment in the chat from Ken Kraus as well asking that.

2011
03:24:24,292 --> 03:24:25,154
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you for answering.

2012
03:24:25,655 --> 03:24:27,239
[SPEAKER_09]: Amanda, it's getting late.

2013
03:24:27,319 --> 03:24:30,305
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have a couple more comments that you took from the phone or?

2014
03:24:32,708 --> 03:24:38,351
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, just one follow up question from Tina Rap Rapatino, 81 Marshall Street.

2015
03:24:38,972 --> 03:24:52,419
[SPEAKER_22]: She was wondering, and she was directing this to make of any from the study that you referred to the to 2011 study if you recall, like what building was the one that was deemed to be generating the noise.

2016
03:24:54,381 --> 03:25:03,723
[SPEAKER_22]: And also she wanted to confirm that she would love to be in touch with someone from the proponent team to discuss her concerns.

2017
03:25:07,008 --> 03:25:09,110
[SPEAKER_04]: So off the top of my head, I don't remember.

2018
03:25:09,130 --> 03:25:12,032
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a lot of other ambient noise in the area.

2019
03:25:13,433 --> 03:25:20,679
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was somebody, it was the comment came from somebody on the downhill side of North Ave further away.

2020
03:25:20,759 --> 03:25:27,365
[SPEAKER_04]: So it might've been, it could have been somebody that was closer to the whole food section, potentially that complex there.

2021
03:25:28,346 --> 03:25:35,952
[SPEAKER_04]: And as Dennis mentioned, we're happy to have a conversation with anybody who wants to reach out to us and further that.

2022
03:25:42,741 --> 03:25:43,862
[SPEAKER_09]: Was there anything else, Amanda?

2023
03:25:43,962 --> 03:25:46,143
[SPEAKER_09]: I know you looked like you were on the phone for a little bit.

2024
03:25:46,844 --> 03:25:50,065
[SPEAKER_22]: No, that was it and no comments over email.

2025
03:25:50,145 --> 03:25:50,566
[SPEAKER_22]: Excellent.

2026
03:25:53,007 --> 03:25:55,008
[SPEAKER_09]: Any other comments from board members?

2027
03:25:59,591 --> 03:26:06,795
[SPEAKER_09]: So our role as a board, obviously, we're not the approval granting authority here.

2028
03:26:06,915 --> 03:26:10,097
[SPEAKER_09]: We are making recommendations to the ZBA.

2029
03:26:11,903 --> 03:26:14,004
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we've covered a lot of ground.

2030
03:26:14,084 --> 03:26:24,550
[SPEAKER_09]: So we would, I think need to get the notes from the community development staff and write that up into a letter.

2031
03:26:24,570 --> 03:26:29,433
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, Alicia, if you think you're able to kind of do a quick summary or not of that.

2032
03:26:29,453 --> 03:26:36,977
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have been taking a number of the notes and

2033
03:26:38,724 --> 03:26:44,182
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually had one sort of, why don't I read through what we have so far?

2034
03:26:46,703 --> 03:26:59,815
[SPEAKER_11]: So what we jotted down a lot of the conditions that we heard the members saying and that we heard the proponent feeling amenable to, hopefully we caught all of them here.

2035
03:27:00,976 --> 03:27:04,079
[SPEAKER_11]: So I indicated it as a bus stop bench.

2036
03:27:04,839 --> 03:27:08,162
[SPEAKER_11]: The proponent would provide seating near the bus stop.

2037
03:27:09,693 --> 03:27:12,415
[SPEAKER_11]: that they would be improving bicycle facilities.

2038
03:27:12,615 --> 03:27:19,960
[SPEAKER_11]: But I have to tell you that I'm going to have to verify that this is done and that is no longer clear enough to me that I know what that means.

2039
03:27:20,060 --> 03:27:22,722
[SPEAKER_11]: So we'll need to elucidate what that one was.

2040
03:27:22,742 --> 03:27:29,808
[SPEAKER_11]: Anybody want to expand on improved bicycle facilities?

2041
03:27:30,848 --> 03:27:31,028
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

2042
03:27:31,048 --> 03:27:31,689
[SPEAKER_15]: Go ahead, Mr. Blake.

2043
03:27:37,297 --> 03:27:51,502
[SPEAKER_20]: If the board ends up recommending to go with some of the bike and some of the signal stuff, or the proponent had asked if the improvements could be all kept in Medford, then I'd suggest that you could go even further with the bicycle amenities up Boston Ave.

2044
03:27:52,923 --> 03:27:56,284
[SPEAKER_11]: Bicycle amenities means bike lanes and painting.

2045
03:27:56,564 --> 03:27:59,165
[SPEAKER_11]: Because in my world, that means bike racks too.

2046
03:28:00,760 --> 03:28:17,591
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, so for that specific question, so it would be to enhance the existing bike lanes, uphill bike lanes, with special markings at the conflict points, so at every cross street.

2047
03:28:19,792 --> 03:28:25,996
[SPEAKER_20]: And then the downhill, it would be to enhance the existing markings by making the sheriffs super sheriffs.

2048
03:28:28,992 --> 03:28:39,583
[SPEAKER_11]: And it seems to me, I know I fully understand that the proponent would prefer to keep things where the city has jurisdiction because of the difficulty sometimes of coordinating with the state.

2049
03:28:40,684 --> 03:28:42,846
[SPEAKER_11]: But some of these go straight into Somerville.

2050
03:28:43,307 --> 03:28:50,854
[SPEAKER_11]: But Todd, do we feel very comfortable that we could facilitate if things needed to be in order to have consistency

2051
03:28:51,515 --> 03:28:52,737
[SPEAKER_11]: for the bike markings.

2052
03:28:52,997 --> 03:29:00,727
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean right now it is consistent between Medford and Somerville on by Boston Ave that we could facilitate that very easily.

2053
03:29:01,858 --> 03:29:02,638
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I think so.

2054
03:29:03,638 --> 03:29:12,660
[SPEAKER_20]: When I first arrived here, we coordinated with Somerville to adjust some of the markings approaching the other side bus at Mystic Valley Parkway.

2055
03:29:12,700 --> 03:29:14,340
[SPEAKER_20]: So, yeah, I'm comfortable with that.

2056
03:29:15,501 --> 03:29:23,842
[SPEAKER_20]: But, you know, with this board, any official approval will probably have to have the language subject to DCR and Somerville, but I'm pretty confident.

2057
03:29:24,522 --> 03:29:26,643
[SPEAKER_20]: And then to get back to the bus,

2058
03:29:29,184 --> 03:29:37,351
[SPEAKER_20]: The bus bench, is that just one because there's a stop in each direction is just to stop on the proponent side or the other one as well.

2059
03:29:39,392 --> 03:29:40,793
[SPEAKER_20]: So there's a bus stop on both sides.

2060
03:29:40,813 --> 03:29:44,877
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I think from my perspective, it should be both.

2061
03:29:48,632 --> 03:29:57,902
[SPEAKER_11]: Todd, if you feel that there's sidewalk space and the city has the appropriate space on the other side of the sidewalk, I assume the proponent hasn't examined that.

2062
03:29:58,602 --> 03:29:59,844
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I mean, there is the buffer.

2063
03:29:59,864 --> 03:30:10,315
[SPEAKER_09]: It could be incorporated potentially a bench and ideally some kind of shelter on the property.

2064
03:30:13,138 --> 03:30:26,544
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, and as far as the opposite side Alicia, you could write it in such a way that provide a bus, a bench, if it's, you know, if accessibility allows and if not, you know, then it's not their fault.

2065
03:30:27,304 --> 03:30:31,646
[SPEAKER_20]: But I believe a bench will fit on the opposite side, it's up the bus stops up near Harris.

2066
03:30:35,173 --> 03:30:46,220
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, shelters, Mr. Chair, we're working on some ourselves, and sometimes they get challenging to fit within the right of way, but as you mentioned, on their side, they may have the space.

2067
03:30:46,240 --> 03:30:52,043
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, if it could be incorporated into the landscaping plan, then that would be great.

2068
03:30:55,465 --> 03:30:57,286
[SPEAKER_11]: Should I go on?

2069
03:30:59,467 --> 03:31:01,208
[SPEAKER_11]: Add pedestrian warning signs.

2070
03:31:02,109 --> 03:31:03,730
[SPEAKER_11]: There was a specific location.

2071
03:31:06,165 --> 03:31:09,886
[SPEAKER_20]: So that one, this gets back to, sorry for the complicated answers.

2072
03:31:09,926 --> 03:31:12,946
[SPEAKER_20]: This gets back to the recommended cap.

2073
03:31:13,726 --> 03:31:27,989
[SPEAKER_20]: So there's static, just aluminum, fluorescent, yellow, green warning signs, but there's a next step of enhancement where you could add the LED flashing border, which is a higher cost.

2074
03:31:28,489 --> 03:31:30,909
[SPEAKER_20]: So it depends on the menu that's ultimately chosen.

2075
03:31:31,029 --> 03:31:33,030
[SPEAKER_11]: If- We're choosing the menu now.

2076
03:31:33,310 --> 03:31:35,410
[SPEAKER_11]: What is the location for the pedestrian sign?

2077
03:31:36,875 --> 03:31:43,901
[SPEAKER_20]: So there's two existing un-signalized crosswalks, one at Harris, one near Harris and one near Irvington.

2078
03:31:43,921 --> 03:31:50,887
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't hear what you said.

2079
03:31:52,969 --> 03:31:56,051
[SPEAKER_20]: Irvington, I believe, which is technically Somerville.

2080
03:31:56,071 --> 03:32:00,395
[SPEAKER_20]: So the crosswalk is kind of right on the city border, exactly.

2081
03:32:05,107 --> 03:32:10,109
[SPEAKER_11]: I know we're working on several joint projects with Somerville transportation staff right now.

2082
03:32:12,450 --> 03:32:21,535
[SPEAKER_11]: I had approached DCR about improving signal timing at Mystic Valley Parkway in Boston Ave and look into additional signal heads at Mystic Valley Parkway.

2083
03:32:24,597 --> 03:32:27,078
[SPEAKER_11]: Require occupancy sensors throughout the building.

2084
03:32:27,098 --> 03:32:30,900
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that was stated that it is building code, but I think

2085
03:32:31,789 --> 03:32:34,992
[SPEAKER_11]: My impression was the board would feel better just saying it explicitly.

2086
03:32:36,273 --> 03:32:38,655
[SPEAKER_11]: Any exterior lighting will be down lighting.

2087
03:32:40,276 --> 03:32:53,347
[SPEAKER_11]: Additional trees to shade the patio area, work with the tree warden on the appropriate trees, give height without disrupting the sidewalk, and additional sidewalk trees as possible.

2088
03:32:53,367 --> 03:32:57,190
[SPEAKER_11]: That's appropriate.

2089
03:33:01,382 --> 03:33:08,127
[SPEAKER_11]: and then either paint the crosswalk across driveway or make the sidewalk look continuous with the sidewalk by making it concrete.

2090
03:33:08,647 --> 03:33:20,316
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just wanted to put it that way in case during the construction, the proponent found that they were rebuilding the sidewalk, then, you know, the driveway, there would be the option of going either way.

2091
03:33:20,336 --> 03:33:27,361
[SPEAKER_11]: Rooftop equipment will be low noise as possible and will include appropriate noise screening.

2092
03:33:30,319 --> 03:33:36,822
[SPEAKER_11]: there was then incorporate the comments from the board of health and the fire department.

2093
03:33:39,464 --> 03:33:45,907
[SPEAKER_11]: Incorporate the engineering comments and then the traffic portion though, I think we've been addressing separately.

2094
03:33:45,927 --> 03:33:50,950
[SPEAKER_09]: And the solar we covered as well.

2095
03:33:53,671 --> 03:33:56,312
[SPEAKER_11]: I did want to bring up the,

2096
03:33:57,778 --> 03:34:06,770
[SPEAKER_11]: The historic commission letter was really more advice and design and wasn't designed as conditions that they could adopt.

2097
03:34:07,171 --> 03:34:09,734
[SPEAKER_11]: There was one thing in there that we didn't mention and that was

2098
03:34:11,017 --> 03:34:19,801
[SPEAKER_11]: asking that they would use Tufts Transportation Demand stuff, but I'm unclear that they have the authority to do that as this is not a Tufts entity.

2099
03:34:20,921 --> 03:34:33,546
[SPEAKER_11]: In my opinion, we could say that any Tufts occupation of the space would be part of the Tufts Transportation Demand Management Plan.

2100
03:34:34,086 --> 03:34:35,847
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm wondering if that would be deemed fair.

2101
03:34:39,712 --> 03:34:41,694
[SPEAKER_11]: Anybody have any concerns about that?

2102
03:34:42,975 --> 03:34:48,279
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I mean, I'd like to ask the proponent if they do any kind of transportation demand management on their properties right now.

2103
03:34:51,242 --> 03:34:52,222
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yes, we.

2104
03:34:54,012 --> 03:35:02,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the larger properties that specifically in Beverly, we have a couple of really sizable campuses have TDM plans.

2105
03:35:04,156 --> 03:35:09,238
[SPEAKER_04]: The point that this size property probably wouldn't warrant something like that.

2106
03:35:09,798 --> 03:35:11,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Tufts size property kind of does though.

2107
03:35:12,179 --> 03:35:18,042
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that they have, we actually spoke with the representative from Tufts about this specific comment.

2108
03:35:19,543 --> 03:35:20,764
[SPEAKER_04]: We are separate from Tufts.

2109
03:35:21,384 --> 03:35:33,874
[SPEAKER_04]: I suspect, I know Tufts has a TDM plan, and I know they're potentially in the process of revisiting it now that when the Green Line comes aboard, it's going to change their TDM plan significantly, potentially.

2110
03:35:34,355 --> 03:35:45,003
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think, you know, that the Tufts people using our building, I suspect that's part of their TDM, because it's part of, you know,

2111
03:35:45,864 --> 03:35:50,287
[SPEAKER_04]: buildings that they manage or facilities that they're part of.

2112
03:35:51,728 --> 03:35:55,410
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't know that, again, we're kind of separate from them so I don't know how.

2113
03:35:56,751 --> 03:36:01,074
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have much say in how they run their TDM.

2114
03:36:02,195 --> 03:36:05,437
[SPEAKER_17]: That's least there they don't own that space correct.

2115
03:36:05,937 --> 03:36:06,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.

2116
03:36:06,338 --> 03:36:06,958
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all least.

2117
03:36:07,318 --> 03:36:07,598
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

2118
03:36:08,039 --> 03:36:08,159
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

2119
03:36:11,928 --> 03:36:15,230
[SPEAKER_11]: So how do we just leave that out?

2120
03:36:15,270 --> 03:36:29,056
[SPEAKER_11]: So as I was saying which letters to incorporate, my instinct was to not include the historic commission as requirements.

2121
03:36:29,436 --> 03:36:30,537
[SPEAKER_11]: Those are not requirements.

2122
03:36:30,577 --> 03:36:32,818
[SPEAKER_11]: Those were sort of design recommendations.

2123
03:36:36,120 --> 03:36:36,800
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, right.

2124
03:36:36,920 --> 03:36:37,320
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree.

2125
03:36:42,116 --> 03:36:47,357
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, and Tim, I wanted to check about some of your requirements.

2126
03:36:47,377 --> 03:37:03,360
[SPEAKER_11]: Some talked about revision of plans, and I wanted to understand if you wanted to see the revision of the plans, and did we need more interaction with Water and Sewer before we could make our recommendations to the Zoning Board of Appeals?

2127
03:37:06,441 --> 03:37:07,621
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think so.

2128
03:37:09,667 --> 03:37:16,553
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I tried to write my comments so they could be recommended.

2129
03:37:16,573 --> 03:37:28,484
[SPEAKER_05]: The building plan process is when I typically get into the nitty gritties to make sure that exactly what is on the plan is going to be exactly what is built.

2130
03:37:30,990 --> 03:37:42,335
[SPEAKER_05]: So it really is up to the board but I don't necessarily, I don't take any exception to plan revisions happening now during this process of plan revisions happening before they get the building permit.

2131
03:37:42,775 --> 03:37:50,198
[SPEAKER_05]: In my mind, either the types of revisions on the utilities that I'm looking at could happen at either level.

2132
03:37:51,079 --> 03:38:00,389
[SPEAKER_05]: And Todd, if you can hear me, if you disagree with what I'm saying regarding some of the traffic and transportation conditions, speak up, but I don't think that's the case either.

2133
03:38:00,409 --> 03:38:00,449
[SPEAKER_05]: So.

2134
03:38:03,680 --> 03:38:07,202
[SPEAKER_11]: And in this case, this board is not making the permit decision.

2135
03:38:07,282 --> 03:38:11,524
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a recommendation to the ZBA.

2136
03:38:11,544 --> 03:38:15,547
[SPEAKER_11]: And your letter, Tim's letter is actually to the chair of the ZBA.

2137
03:38:17,247 --> 03:38:21,110
[SPEAKER_11]: So there is still another meeting to have time.

2138
03:38:21,130 --> 03:38:27,293
[SPEAKER_11]: I will, the ZBA has advertised their hearing for next week on this topic.

2139
03:38:29,334 --> 03:38:29,974
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, we should,

2140
03:38:32,888 --> 03:38:35,830
[SPEAKER_17]: They're looking to us to guide them in their decision, correct?

2141
03:38:36,070 --> 03:38:36,631
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

2142
03:38:36,991 --> 03:38:37,311
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

2143
03:38:38,692 --> 03:38:38,852
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

2144
03:38:38,992 --> 03:38:49,840
[SPEAKER_11]: So our recommendation could be to compliance with the engineering, right, the engineering and traffic recommendations.

2145
03:38:50,981 --> 03:38:56,345
[SPEAKER_11]: I think actually Amanda pulled for us, she messaged me in the background the exact language.

2146
03:38:58,045 --> 03:39:08,029
[SPEAKER_11]: the building commissioners letter is that the community development board will perform a site plan review and submit its recommendations to the ZBA.

2147
03:39:08,049 --> 03:39:14,932
[SPEAKER_09]: I think generally the way we do it, I'm just going back to look at some of the notes.

2148
03:39:15,032 --> 03:39:22,295
[SPEAKER_09]: We would vote to recommend that the ZBA approve the site plan review application with

2149
03:39:23,134 --> 03:39:24,095
[SPEAKER_09]: a set of conditions.

2150
03:39:24,915 --> 03:39:28,798
[SPEAKER_09]: And those conditions would be our design recommendations.

2151
03:39:30,659 --> 03:39:33,481
[SPEAKER_09]: And the ZBA can take them or leave them.

2152
03:39:36,543 --> 03:39:38,184
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it's a recommendation.

2153
03:39:40,365 --> 03:39:49,011
[SPEAKER_20]: In terms of Tim's comment with the traffic, since the traffic was discussed at this meeting and the board will ultimately recommend the list that Alicia read off,

2154
03:39:51,079 --> 03:40:09,029
[SPEAKER_20]: I could always revise my personal letter to the zoning board to say we're in concurrence with what the planning board is recommending since we all just discussed the menu of options and came to some conclusion that will now be different than what's written in my original memo.

2155
03:40:11,570 --> 03:40:15,872
[SPEAKER_11]: Those were the items that we captured in our notes.

2156
03:40:17,653 --> 03:40:18,374
[SPEAKER_11]: Were there other

2157
03:40:19,558 --> 03:40:25,043
[SPEAKER_11]: conditions that board members may have mentioned that we did not capture.

2158
03:40:25,063 --> 03:40:30,087
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, we're human.

2159
03:40:31,749 --> 03:40:35,512
[SPEAKER_09]: Not off the top of my head, but generally the, go ahead, Mr. Avaney.

2160
03:40:36,193 --> 03:40:46,482
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just said, and if I don't want to interrupt anybody, if somebody had something to say, I just wanted to go back to one of the comments that Planning Director Hunt mentioned.

2161
03:40:47,101 --> 03:40:51,362
[SPEAKER_04]: regarding our interaction with the DCR and potential signal heads.

2162
03:40:51,702 --> 03:41:07,406
[SPEAKER_04]: I think in some of the comments from the board members, it was very, at the very least, if we could engage them about the signal timing as opposed to equipment, I think that's a significant difference that I'd like to just put that out here.

2163
03:41:07,446 --> 03:41:10,907
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's a little different than installing new equipment on there.

2164
03:41:11,507 --> 03:41:15,808
[SPEAKER_04]: We're comfortable reaching out and seeing if signal optimization can be done with

2165
03:41:17,268 --> 03:41:19,109
[SPEAKER_04]: and minimal pain to everybody.

2166
03:41:20,189 --> 03:41:27,991
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that level of revising the equipment out there that Rod had mentioned, they're looking at that whole corridor anyway.

2167
03:41:28,011 --> 03:41:44,396
[SPEAKER_25]: I think that's probably not something we want to... I would be okay with just talking about signal timing, optimization, and checking the yellow and all red and pedestrian interval times as well.

2168
03:41:46,357 --> 03:41:46,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2169
03:41:49,023 --> 03:41:55,467
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to work with DCR to improve signal timing at the Valley Parkway and Boston Ave.

2170
03:41:55,707 --> 03:41:58,209
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you want me to put an additional?

2171
03:41:58,649 --> 03:41:59,269
[SPEAKER_25]: And Auburn.

2172
03:42:05,493 --> 03:42:08,435
[SPEAKER_25]: Those are the two high crash locations.

2173
03:42:12,246 --> 03:42:15,006
[SPEAKER_19]: Could I, this is Rod Emery, could I ask a point of clarification?

2174
03:42:15,807 --> 03:42:32,170
[SPEAKER_19]: Todd mentioned there's a $20,000 cap on these, so if we have these conditions, one, two, three, and four, that are all traffic related, are they subject to a $20,000 cap so that we might only do one, two, and three, or one, three, and four, if they amount to $20,000?

2175
03:42:32,230 --> 03:42:37,190
[SPEAKER_19]: We need some language about the $20,000, I guess is what I'm saying.

2176
03:42:41,588 --> 03:42:56,084
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that was a recommendation to the board so that because he Todd did not want us the board to require everything on his list, and we're trying to give some guidelines about what would be a reasonable amount of things.

2177
03:42:56,104 --> 03:42:59,848
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think

2178
03:43:01,822 --> 03:43:02,563
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead, Mr. Blake.

2179
03:43:02,943 --> 03:43:03,283
[SPEAKER_20]: Sorry.

2180
03:43:03,684 --> 03:43:13,752
[SPEAKER_20]: And I just, you know, in my, that was my personal recommendation of it seemed appropriate in terms of the level of impact and the cost, but the board may or may not agree with that.

2181
03:43:13,892 --> 03:43:22,840
[SPEAKER_20]: So, you know, that's, and then some of the things that we did discuss, like how far up Boston Ave you go with the bicycle treatments that impacts the cost as well.

2182
03:43:22,880 --> 03:43:23,681
[SPEAKER_20]: That's what I was getting at.

2183
03:43:23,841 --> 03:43:27,785
[SPEAKER_20]: Depending on the final menu, it could be under, at, or over that.

2184
03:43:28,385 --> 03:43:35,811
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, and I don't want to assume that the board is in agreement with the 20 or not either so yeah, and I don't think we're in a position to really

2185
03:43:37,201 --> 03:43:52,397
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, obviously cost these things out and make a decision, but I do think we've had a productive conversation about what we think is important and we've narrowed down, I believe, in a way that, you know, you guys, the proponents can manage.

2186
03:43:53,399 --> 03:43:59,065
[SPEAKER_09]: If you disagree with that, then you should probably say that now, but I think it's a reasonable set of conditions.

2187
03:44:00,370 --> 03:44:06,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I do too, I think, but I don't disagree that there should be some kind of a limit to it.

2188
03:44:06,751 --> 03:44:19,193
[SPEAKER_04]: I would hope that the board would consider that if we did enough work, if we made an investment here in something, you know, one of these items is $25,000 and that's the one we're gonna do, then that would be reasonable.

2189
03:44:19,213 --> 03:44:29,075
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's the approach that there's a handful of things that are important, and if we can accomplish all of them, great, with a reasonable amount of cost,

2190
03:44:29,855 --> 03:44:35,239
[SPEAKER_04]: we're for it, but we don't want to be burdened by, okay, this is $100,000 worth of stuff, and that's what we're going to do.

2191
03:44:35,319 --> 03:44:43,925
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we'd like the board to consider that the $20,000 is a reasonable amount of mitigation for a project of this scope.

2192
03:44:45,626 --> 03:44:51,250
[SPEAKER_25]: Relative to pretty much anything else, signal timing is pretty low cost.

2193
03:44:52,805 --> 03:44:58,907
[SPEAKER_04]: It is, but we're going to, unfortunately though, you're going to spend money on the traffic engineers to kind of figure that out.

2194
03:44:58,927 --> 03:45:06,629
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's going to be, which is why we were kind of leaning towards some of the things, as we mentioned at the beginning, some of the things that had real impact.

2195
03:45:06,669 --> 03:45:13,570
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know that does, I'm not discounting that at all, but there's going to be costs in that, that, and maybe that cost is worth it.

2196
03:45:13,670 --> 03:45:14,231
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

2197
03:45:14,271 --> 03:45:17,051
[SPEAKER_04]: I just didn't know whether it's physical and it is physical.

2198
03:45:17,131 --> 03:45:18,652
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's fine.

2199
03:45:18,692 --> 03:45:18,952
[SPEAKER_04]: I think,

2200
03:45:19,892 --> 03:45:22,915
[SPEAKER_04]: some of that money we spent with engineering, and that's okay too.

2201
03:45:24,336 --> 03:45:35,945
[SPEAKER_24]: Rod and Mike, is it reasonable to think that we could get our own internal sense for the ballpark on these costs between now and the time we're scheduled to be in front of Board of Appeals?

2202
03:45:36,666 --> 03:45:47,675
[SPEAKER_24]: And that if these folks make a recommendation that says they think this is an appropriate scope of work, that we'll be able to respond more specifically in our next presentation?

2203
03:45:49,804 --> 03:45:52,085
[SPEAKER_19]: Sure, we can definitely come up with cost estimates.

2204
03:45:52,585 --> 03:45:52,865
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

2205
03:45:53,265 --> 03:46:07,509
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, I'd like to think we're in the right ballpark, but this is all coming together in real time and appreciate that everybody really is rolling up the sleeves and just talking about these issues.

2206
03:46:07,569 --> 03:46:08,389
[SPEAKER_24]: We're right with you.

2207
03:46:08,869 --> 03:46:10,490
[SPEAKER_24]: We want the project to be a success.

2208
03:46:11,090 --> 03:46:18,852
[SPEAKER_24]: In order for it to be a success, it not only has to be imminently leaseable, the market needs to want what we're doing,

2209
03:46:19,451 --> 03:46:25,232
[SPEAKER_24]: but it also has to fit with the neighborhood and has to sit with the rest of the campus because we're not looking to create problems.

2210
03:46:25,272 --> 03:46:27,013
[SPEAKER_24]: So we are listening.

2211
03:46:28,493 --> 03:46:30,373
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's a good suggestion, Mr. Clark.

2212
03:46:30,734 --> 03:46:36,695
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, we have the opportunity to tweak the language a little bit.

2213
03:46:36,875 --> 03:46:40,996
[SPEAKER_09]: I can finalize it with the city staff before it goes to the ZBA.

2214
03:46:41,036 --> 03:46:45,957
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, there's some time for you guys to be in that loop still.

2215
03:46:47,855 --> 03:46:48,236
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

2216
03:46:48,897 --> 03:46:49,238
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

2217
03:46:49,258 --> 03:46:49,719
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

2218
03:46:51,502 --> 03:46:52,484
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, Ms.

2219
03:46:52,504 --> 03:46:52,884
[SPEAKER_09]: Furtado.

2220
03:46:53,768 --> 03:46:54,769
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry, Andre.

2221
03:46:54,789 --> 03:46:59,472
[SPEAKER_17]: I just wanted to piggyback and say we're definitely not looking to cause you financial hardship, right?

2222
03:46:59,492 --> 03:47:02,373
[SPEAKER_17]: But we're also not looking to lowball the community area.

2223
03:47:02,414 --> 03:47:12,740
[SPEAKER_17]: So just as long as we're able to apply what makes the most sense there, I think that'll be the best result for all.

2224
03:47:13,060 --> 03:47:18,464
[SPEAKER_17]: And again, we're not looking to put you in economic hardship, but we're also not in a position to deal with costs at this point.

2225
03:47:18,524 --> 03:47:23,467
[SPEAKER_17]: So the more that you can do to help us help you, as Andre has already laid out, would be most beneficial.

2226
03:47:25,365 --> 03:47:25,665
[SPEAKER_04]: enough.

2227
03:47:25,945 --> 03:47:26,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2228
03:47:28,806 --> 03:47:29,827
[SPEAKER_16]: And this is Chrissy Dowd.

2229
03:47:30,347 --> 03:47:51,074
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you mind if I just make one more point just in terms of the, thank you, in terms of the commercial space on the ground floor when it comes to the neighborhood, I would encourage you to have more conversations with the abutters and the neighbors and make sure that it's something that people also want there and they, you know, would like to have in the neighborhood.

2230
03:47:53,149 --> 03:47:56,930
[SPEAKER_09]: and to get a local independent business if possible.

2231
03:47:58,871 --> 03:47:59,791
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, Mr. Schrader.

2232
03:48:00,611 --> 03:48:02,532
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, Christy, I'm glad you brought that up.

2233
03:48:03,732 --> 03:48:10,294
[SPEAKER_23]: In the industrial district, the ground floor uses that we would like to see there aren't permitted at the moment.

2234
03:48:10,474 --> 03:48:18,977
[SPEAKER_23]: So if it stays the same, those would actually have to come back for approval as a use variance.

2235
03:48:20,322 --> 03:48:22,164
[SPEAKER_23]: Maybe we'll get that changed in the meantime.

2236
03:48:22,204 --> 03:48:28,288
[SPEAKER_23]: There's some discussion through the recodification process of adjusting that, but I think we're all in agreement.

2237
03:48:28,328 --> 03:48:32,832
[SPEAKER_23]: We'd like to see active, you know, neighborhood friendly uses on the ground floor.

2238
03:48:32,912 --> 03:48:38,196
[SPEAKER_23]: And we might have to get approval for those when it comes up.

2239
03:48:44,281 --> 03:48:44,521
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

2240
03:48:44,621 --> 03:48:46,563
[SPEAKER_09]: Any other final thoughts?

2241
03:48:50,611 --> 03:48:51,392
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

2242
03:48:51,412 --> 03:49:00,323
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think we could entertain a motion at this time to approve the project.

2243
03:49:05,423 --> 03:49:15,086
[SPEAKER_09]: recommend to the ZBA site plan approval of the project with the following design recommendations.

2244
03:49:15,707 --> 03:49:30,972
[SPEAKER_09]: And those recommendations would be the ones that Director Hunt just articulated, and that it would be the language to be finalized by the Community Development Board.

2245
03:49:32,412 --> 03:49:37,776
[SPEAKER_09]: staff and approved by the Community Development Chair.

2246
03:49:40,718 --> 03:49:45,081
[SPEAKER_09]: Would somebody be willing to make that motion and you don't have to repeat it?

2247
03:49:45,101 --> 03:49:48,564
[SPEAKER_17]: This is Jackie Vitale.

2248
03:49:48,584 --> 03:49:51,025
[SPEAKER_17]: Since I do not have to repeat it fully, I make the motion.

2249
03:49:52,587 --> 03:49:54,028
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyone want to second the motion?

2250
03:49:55,146 --> 03:49:56,747
[SPEAKER_16]: This is Kristi Dowd, I'll second.

2251
03:49:57,587 --> 03:49:58,988
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Kristi, appreciate it.

2252
03:50:00,588 --> 03:50:04,270
[SPEAKER_09]: Roll call approval on the motion.

2253
03:50:04,410 --> 03:50:08,652
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes is approval and nay is disapproval.

2254
03:50:08,672 --> 03:50:11,993
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see, Klesson Dresen.

2255
03:50:13,974 --> 03:50:14,254
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2256
03:50:16,055 --> 03:50:16,695
[SPEAKER_09]: Kristi Dowd.

2257
03:50:17,835 --> 03:50:18,155
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

2258
03:50:19,336 --> 03:50:20,156
[SPEAKER_09]: Jackie Furtado.

2259
03:50:20,817 --> 03:50:21,077
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

2260
03:50:23,458 --> 03:50:24,078
[SPEAKER_09]: Deanna Peabody.

2261
03:50:26,885 --> 03:50:33,429
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm a yes as well with David Bloomberg recusing himself from this discussion.

2262
03:50:33,449 --> 03:50:38,333
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's unanimously approved by the Medford Community Development Board.

2263
03:50:39,654 --> 03:50:41,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you all for taking so much time.

2264
03:50:42,395 --> 03:50:47,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you all for all the time you've put into this to echo Dennis's earlier comments.

2265
03:50:48,840 --> 03:50:49,500
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.

2266
03:50:49,560 --> 03:50:51,201
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you've got more business this evening.

2267
03:50:52,995 --> 03:50:54,196
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll check out.

2268
03:50:54,376 --> 03:50:55,136
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

2269
03:50:55,176 --> 03:50:55,457
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

2270
03:50:55,617 --> 03:51:08,765
[SPEAKER_09]: I should say, you know, we didn't actually talk specifically about the design, but, you know, absent the, you know, independent of the scale issue, I think it was, you know, it's a nice design and thank you for putting the time into it.

2271
03:51:08,845 --> 03:51:13,288
[SPEAKER_09]: Obviously the fact that it didn't come up meant that it was something that people did like.

2272
03:51:14,189 --> 03:51:14,969
[SPEAKER_04]: We appreciate it.

2273
03:51:15,009 --> 03:51:15,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.

2274
03:51:16,550 --> 03:51:17,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

2275
03:51:17,871 --> 03:51:18,071
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2276
03:51:18,331 --> 03:51:18,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you all.

2277
03:51:19,332 --> 03:51:20,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a fantastic evening.

2278
03:51:20,953 --> 03:51:21,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2279
03:51:25,735 --> 03:51:28,157
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, I know it's a long evening, folks.

2280
03:51:28,197 --> 03:51:36,105
[SPEAKER_09]: So there is one more thing we need to do, which is review a bond release request for the Macklin Road Definitive Subdivision.

2281
03:51:36,826 --> 03:51:44,693
[SPEAKER_09]: And just to summarize where we are on this, this was a three lot subdivision that was approved with conditions by the Community Development Board at a hearing on July 26, 2017.

2282
03:51:47,896 --> 03:52:02,659
[SPEAKER_09]: We approved a performance bond amount of $600,000, which was reduced to $194,037 last year in 2020, based on the work that was completed at the time at the recommendation of the city engineer.

2283
03:52:03,739 --> 03:52:08,941
[SPEAKER_09]: The applicant has now requested that the bond be released to $5,000.

2284
03:52:09,861 --> 03:52:15,122
[SPEAKER_09]: The engineering division has conducted a site visit and inspection, and they're recommending

2285
03:52:15,922 --> 03:52:23,966
[SPEAKER_09]: reducing the bond down to 19,550 with that includes some contingency.

2286
03:52:24,586 --> 03:52:30,589
[SPEAKER_09]: So let me go to the applicant to present their request.

2287
03:52:30,649 --> 03:52:39,854
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's John Valdina and Benjamin Minix from Eagle Brook, the applicant and Benjamin Minix from Eagle Brook Engineering.

2288
03:52:39,894 --> 03:52:42,435
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know if John, you wanna take it away.

2289
03:52:44,184 --> 03:52:44,584
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll take it.

2290
03:52:45,124 --> 03:52:45,805
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you hear me okay?

2291
03:52:46,505 --> 03:52:47,085
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, we can.

2292
03:52:47,165 --> 03:52:47,806
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks, Benjamin.

2293
03:52:47,826 --> 03:52:50,467
[SPEAKER_09]: And sorry for the long night and wait on this.

2294
03:52:51,628 --> 03:52:51,968
[SPEAKER_07]: It happens.

2295
03:52:51,988 --> 03:52:53,809
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for sticking around at the end.

2296
03:52:53,849 --> 03:52:58,111
[SPEAKER_07]: I know sometimes get cut off, so it's good to still be before you.

2297
03:52:58,271 --> 03:53:01,272
[SPEAKER_07]: So again, Ben Minnix with Eagle Brook Engineering.

2298
03:53:02,453 --> 03:53:06,295
[SPEAKER_07]: So we are requesting release of the bond for the Macklin Road subdivision.

2299
03:53:07,335 --> 03:53:12,998
[SPEAKER_07]: We presented a letter to you as well as Tim McGibbon just documenting

2300
03:53:13,672 --> 03:53:16,054
[SPEAKER_07]: along with the asphalt plan, but it's been completed.

2301
03:53:16,895 --> 03:53:21,680
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Tim McGivern provided a memo in response with some outstanding items.

2302
03:53:22,560 --> 03:53:32,870
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't know what the best way to do this would be to go through the items on each line or how you want to view it.

2303
03:53:34,197 --> 03:53:39,918
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe we could just go to Tim and get his feedback on it, so we don't have to go through everything.

2304
03:53:40,138 --> 03:53:42,018
[SPEAKER_09]: Alicia, Director Hunt, are you going to?

2305
03:53:42,479 --> 03:53:51,720
[SPEAKER_11]: It seems to me if there are items that you agree with, you just agree, and if there are, you know, go through the ones that you disagree with.

2306
03:53:51,740 --> 03:53:59,781
[SPEAKER_11]: The board, if anything that you agree with, and the board is just going to agree with Tim if you agree.

2307
03:54:00,542 --> 03:54:02,582
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that sounds reasonable.

2308
03:54:03,810 --> 03:54:05,590
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, yeah, I can go through these quick.

2309
03:54:05,811 --> 03:54:09,091
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll just go right down the list with the letter from Tim.

2310
03:54:10,372 --> 03:54:13,893
[SPEAKER_07]: First one is earth cuts on the sides of the roadway.

2311
03:54:14,453 --> 03:54:23,995
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically, we need to put more loam and seed along the sides of the roadway where there is excavation and some broken ledge that is exposed.

2312
03:54:24,935 --> 03:54:26,436
[SPEAKER_07]: So we don't object to that one.

2313
03:54:26,476 --> 03:54:27,376
[SPEAKER_07]: We can provide more loam.

2314
03:54:30,702 --> 03:54:35,305
[SPEAKER_07]: And Tim, please cut me off if I'm not understanding your comment correctly.

2315
03:54:37,486 --> 03:54:38,887
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say I'm bad on that one.

2316
03:54:38,907 --> 03:54:47,291
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's like that one I put a photo of, I mean, you can feather that in and put some loam and seed down over it.

2317
03:54:47,972 --> 03:54:51,113
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the solutions don't just include loam and seed.

2318
03:54:51,494 --> 03:54:54,896
[SPEAKER_05]: So generally, we're just looking for a smooth transition in the project.

2319
03:54:56,196 --> 03:54:56,296
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

2320
03:54:59,440 --> 03:55:01,841
[SPEAKER_07]: The underground electric service, I'll come back to that one after.

2321
03:55:01,861 --> 03:55:06,362
[SPEAKER_07]: Number six on the list, it says a stop sign.

2322
03:55:07,222 --> 03:55:09,342
[SPEAKER_07]: John has ordered the stop sign, so we're going to put the stop sign in.

2323
03:55:12,443 --> 03:55:15,164
[SPEAKER_07]: Number nine on the list, the trees.

2324
03:55:16,404 --> 03:55:21,125
[SPEAKER_07]: And we needed to get approval from the tree warden for the trees.

2325
03:55:21,665 --> 03:55:23,386
[SPEAKER_07]: Four of the six trees were installed.

2326
03:55:24,466 --> 03:55:28,947
[SPEAKER_07]: So what happened is part of this project had approval with the Conservation Commission.

2327
03:55:29,748 --> 03:55:37,490
[SPEAKER_07]: And at that time, Dennis McDougall staked out the trees within the conservations area as well as on the street.

2328
03:55:38,430 --> 03:55:42,971
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we understood that those were the final trees for the whole project.

2329
03:55:43,452 --> 03:55:44,652
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that's what was installed.

2330
03:55:45,432 --> 03:55:51,754
[SPEAKER_07]: And then when we submitted the test bill plan, it came back up that we were missing trees and that they weren't approved by the warden.

2331
03:55:52,614 --> 03:55:54,514
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's where we stand at this point.

2332
03:55:55,135 --> 03:55:56,255
[SPEAKER_07]: And I also believe

2333
03:55:58,070 --> 03:56:04,532
[SPEAKER_07]: Not all the species of trees were maple, and that was because there was a shortage of maple trees at the time.

2334
03:56:04,652 --> 03:56:11,034
[SPEAKER_07]: And Dennis McDougall recommended trees with a different root system because of the ledge in the area.

2335
03:56:11,054 --> 03:56:13,835
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know if anyone wants to make comments to that.

2336
03:56:13,895 --> 03:56:16,516
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't believe the tree warden's on the call at the time.

2337
03:56:19,937 --> 03:56:24,399
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know, Tim or Alicia, what do we do with that?

2338
03:56:25,992 --> 03:56:34,137
[SPEAKER_05]: The trees, all I need to see is a piece of paper, a document of some sort from the tree warden saying that the rooting has taken place and she approves of the trees.

2339
03:56:34,397 --> 03:56:39,220
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not necessarily about a placement, it's more about the trees are in good shape.

2340
03:56:41,222 --> 03:56:41,442
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

2341
03:56:42,142 --> 03:56:49,287
[SPEAKER_07]: And just to address something else that was on the letters, the location of the trees, whether it's on the right away side or the private property.

2342
03:56:49,307 --> 03:56:53,930
[SPEAKER_07]: We were discussing this in the office after we received the comments and

2343
03:56:55,251 --> 03:56:58,393
[SPEAKER_07]: The road is still private, and two of the lots have already been sold.

2344
03:56:59,473 --> 03:57:10,980
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, and it's maybe not as clear on the as-built plan, but looking at it on a CAD file, I can see that two of the four trees, or excuse me, three of the four trees are actually on the street side of the right-of-way.

2345
03:57:12,281 --> 03:57:20,565
[SPEAKER_07]: But even with conveyance of the private lots, those are still under the ownership of the private street, this hot city street.

2346
03:57:20,605 --> 03:57:23,927
[SPEAKER_07]: So if the city wants to take those over, then they're responsible

2347
03:57:24,498 --> 03:57:25,098
[SPEAKER_07]: to maintain them.

2348
03:57:25,138 --> 03:57:33,660
[SPEAKER_07]: So we just would like some direction if, if that is the way the city wants to go, um, you know, that we'd just come to some sort of conclusion with that.

2349
03:57:33,700 --> 03:57:42,883
[SPEAKER_07]: But if we're all set, as far as the tree wins, um, feel on the matter, then I guess that satisfies the, uh, the issue.

2350
03:57:47,977 --> 03:57:51,121
[SPEAKER_05]: just provide a little bit more info here than Ben did, but thank you, Ben.

2351
03:57:52,102 --> 03:57:59,270
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, it's some of these trees, and I think Ben corrected based off the actual spatial, you know, where the trees actually land.

2352
03:57:59,731 --> 03:58:07,960
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, the subdivision, the definitive subdivision process required trees to go in at some point, you know,

2353
03:58:08,921 --> 03:58:11,423
[SPEAKER_05]: They landed on private property and that was acceptable.

2354
03:58:12,284 --> 03:58:14,806
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the parcels, the building parcels and that was acceptable.

2355
03:58:15,206 --> 03:58:24,974
[SPEAKER_05]: So now really the question is, are these public trees, are they in the, are they going to be in this potentially future public right of way, or are they going to be on

2356
03:58:25,515 --> 03:58:26,876
[SPEAKER_05]: private building parcels.

2357
03:58:27,216 --> 03:58:36,020
[SPEAKER_05]: If they're on private building parcels, does the city want to have control over those trees so they're not cut down or whatever in the future?

2358
03:58:36,901 --> 03:58:41,063
[SPEAKER_05]: That's, I mean, that's really the question on the table at the moment.

2359
03:58:42,083 --> 03:58:51,468
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, because they're trees that are put in as part of the subdivision, this board would be the authority on whether or not those trees become public

2360
03:58:52,268 --> 03:58:54,228
[SPEAKER_05]: trees public assets or not.

2361
03:58:55,349 --> 03:59:04,750
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a hang up here that Ben talked about that title of the property of the parcels has already changed hands at least once.

2362
03:59:05,670 --> 03:59:09,491
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, that might present a challenge.

2363
03:59:12,312 --> 03:59:18,053
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know, Mr. McGivern, is there a decision that we or the board need to make on that?

2364
03:59:18,073 --> 03:59:19,233
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, we're

2365
03:59:20,311 --> 03:59:24,013
[SPEAKER_09]: don't really have anything to do with the, you know, how the trees have been cited.

2366
03:59:25,234 --> 03:59:29,416
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's more about the trees are required as part of the subdivision.

2367
03:59:29,456 --> 03:59:32,018
[SPEAKER_05]: So you need to put trees in the subdivision.

2368
03:59:32,038 --> 03:59:37,141
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe that's part of the regulations of this board.

2369
03:59:37,201 --> 03:59:48,188
[SPEAKER_05]: So instead of the trees being all in the public right of way, which you'd normally see in a subdivision, some of them are on private parcels, but they're taking credit for those as future public trees.

2370
03:59:48,968 --> 03:59:54,052
[SPEAKER_05]: but they're on building lot parcels, so the building owner can just cut them down if they want.

2371
03:59:54,292 --> 03:59:55,593
[SPEAKER_05]: The city doesn't have any control over it.

2372
03:59:56,374 --> 04:00:01,397
[SPEAKER_05]: So if this board is okay with that, then that would have to be documented.

2373
04:00:02,438 --> 04:00:08,382
[SPEAKER_05]: If the board's not okay with that, then there would need to be a way to resolve it.

2374
04:00:08,843 --> 04:00:11,505
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know how to resolve it, we can talk about that, but you know.

2375
04:00:12,461 --> 04:00:14,082
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I think it's okay with us.

2376
04:00:14,162 --> 04:00:22,788
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I don't know how, unless we, you know, turn this into a public way, then I don't see how we do anything else.

2377
04:00:23,629 --> 04:00:34,496
[SPEAKER_05]: One potential way to resolve it is to not accept the trees that aren't, you know, without going back and looking at the whole history, you could say, well, those trees don't count towards the trees in the way, and you haven't put trees in the way.

2378
04:00:34,536 --> 04:00:35,837
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be one idea to resolve it.

2379
04:00:37,640 --> 04:00:44,103
[SPEAKER_05]: But I guess this has more story behind it and this approval precedes me.

2380
04:00:44,163 --> 04:00:46,484
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a question.

2381
04:00:46,504 --> 04:00:52,747
[SPEAKER_11]: So there are, it had required six and through some miscommunication, they ended up planning four.

2382
04:00:53,528 --> 04:00:57,730
[SPEAKER_11]: So are there locations in the future public space?

2383
04:00:57,810 --> 04:01:01,932
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, sort of assuming in the way where they could put two more trees.

2384
04:01:02,618 --> 04:01:03,858
[SPEAKER_11]: that would then be public.

2385
04:01:04,498 --> 04:01:10,640
[SPEAKER_11]: And along those lines, I am aware that the city owns parcels along with this private way.

2386
04:01:10,660 --> 04:01:13,600
[SPEAKER_11]: We do.

2387
04:01:13,800 --> 04:01:16,221
[SPEAKER_11]: In theory, we could ask for trees on those parcels.

2388
04:01:16,281 --> 04:01:24,463
[SPEAKER_11]: The idea is, though, that there was some amenity to the neighbors who lived behind a forest, and now they live behind open backyards.

2389
04:01:28,043 --> 04:01:29,844
[SPEAKER_07]: I think with my...

2390
04:01:31,210 --> 04:01:33,471
[SPEAKER_07]: site knowledge over the last few years, I can speak to that pretty well.

2391
04:01:34,392 --> 04:01:42,757
[SPEAKER_07]: The city-owned parcels on the opposite side of the developed lots, recently developed lots, there's a lot of ledge in that area.

2392
04:01:43,277 --> 04:01:48,520
[SPEAKER_07]: So although there are trees there, I don't think they're reaching their full growth potential.

2393
04:01:48,801 --> 04:01:53,243
[SPEAKER_07]: So to excavate and put in a tree, I don't think is anyone's best interest on that area.

2394
04:01:54,424 --> 04:02:00,848
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the conservation commission actually reduced the number of trees they wanted in the back towards the wetland area.

2395
04:02:01,470 --> 04:02:06,533
[SPEAKER_07]: because just to put them in would cause more disturbance than to leave the area as it is.

2396
04:02:07,573 --> 04:02:18,759
[SPEAKER_07]: And then in order to put in trees along the right-of-way, you only have about three feet of space between the back of sidewalk and the right-of-way property line.

2397
04:02:20,319 --> 04:02:22,200
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're kind of close in there.

2398
04:02:22,240 --> 04:02:24,141
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know exactly where we'd squeeze them in.

2399
04:02:29,983 --> 04:02:34,625
[SPEAKER_09]: But doesn't the city own some of those parcels, like Alicia said?

2400
04:02:34,985 --> 04:02:38,166
[SPEAKER_11]: He was saying that the parcels that the city owns are full of ledge.

2401
04:02:38,386 --> 04:02:39,726
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't know.

2402
04:02:40,047 --> 04:02:43,428
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't done any construction or test bores or anything.

2403
04:02:43,448 --> 04:02:45,609
[SPEAKER_05]: I mentioned those parcels.

2404
04:02:45,629 --> 04:02:46,589
[SPEAKER_05]: They are wooded parcels.

2405
04:02:46,629 --> 04:02:48,510
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're already sort of woods.

2406
04:02:50,910 --> 04:02:52,411
[SPEAKER_11]: They're kind of fully wooded.

2407
04:02:52,711 --> 04:02:54,812
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder, is there space for trees?

2408
04:02:59,561 --> 04:03:03,386
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think he'd be destroying trees to put in trees in those locations.

2409
04:03:04,146 --> 04:03:04,787
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2410
04:03:04,847 --> 04:03:11,534
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would also add in the here to like the, the subdivision regulations that pertain to the way parcel.

2411
04:03:11,795 --> 04:03:20,985
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, um, you know that is that is the purpose of the, of the regulation so I mean I think, you know,

2412
04:03:21,995 --> 04:03:31,481
[SPEAKER_05]: They planted four, and they're supposed to have six, and some are on private parcels and not in the way parcel.

2413
04:03:31,501 --> 04:03:39,986
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, I wish I knew the full history of how they landed, where the trees landed, where they did.

2414
04:03:42,528 --> 04:03:47,971
[SPEAKER_05]: The board does have the ability to say, you know, your plan has six trees in the right-of-way.

2415
04:03:47,991 --> 04:03:50,253
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just gonna look at the plans too.

2416
04:03:53,467 --> 04:04:06,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Do they need to put the six trees in the right of way or is the board okay with not having the trees in the way they're on the building parcels with obviously the risk of the homeowner putting them down?

2417
04:04:06,916 --> 04:04:09,738
[SPEAKER_09]: Does anybody have a photo of this they can just put up on the screen?

2418
04:04:13,001 --> 04:04:19,025
[SPEAKER_07]: The approved site plans show all six trees on the private lots.

2419
04:04:20,212 --> 04:04:21,213
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, that's what I was looking at.

2420
04:04:21,233 --> 04:04:22,433
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I was going to look for, Ben.

2421
04:04:22,453 --> 04:04:22,674
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2422
04:04:22,694 --> 04:04:25,115
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the piece of the history that I don't quite understand.

2423
04:04:25,135 --> 04:04:27,536
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was approved that way for some reason.

2424
04:04:28,337 --> 04:04:36,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you know, so I wasn't going to step, I wasn't going to put my fingers in the approval and say, change the approval around.

2425
04:04:36,242 --> 04:04:41,164
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was approved the way, uh, you know, with, with the trees on the, on the parcels.

2426
04:04:41,385 --> 04:04:42,805
[SPEAKER_05]: So building parcels.

2427
04:04:42,825 --> 04:04:45,447
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I mean, it sounds like, like what,

2428
04:04:46,839 --> 04:04:47,640
[SPEAKER_09]: happened happened.

2429
04:04:47,660 --> 04:04:52,388
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I don't think there's anything the board really needs to do here on this.

2430
04:04:52,408 --> 04:04:57,437
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we need to, in writing, approve like four trees instead of six trees?

2431
04:05:00,058 --> 04:05:04,521
[SPEAKER_11]: It's less about that and more about releasing the bond and are we holding money for that?

2432
04:05:05,362 --> 04:05:24,335
[SPEAKER_11]: I will say that the city does have what we call a back of sidewalk program, where if there isn't sufficient space in a public way for trees and the residents want the trees and the city would like to put trees in, the city does and the city retains ownership for two years and then the trees are

2433
04:05:24,840 --> 04:05:35,348
[SPEAKER_11]: revert to the property owners, which then, I guess what Tim was just mentioning, is that it means that a property owner could just choose to cut it down, is the drawback.

2434
04:05:35,448 --> 04:05:39,651
[SPEAKER_11]: The benefit is that the property owner is now responsible for the maintenance of that trade.

2435
04:05:39,671 --> 04:05:41,012
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

2436
04:05:42,273 --> 04:05:44,754
[SPEAKER_09]: So, okay, I mean, we're just talking about release of the bond.

2437
04:05:44,814 --> 04:05:47,096
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I'm not sure why we're getting into all this detail here.

2438
04:05:47,156 --> 04:05:51,579
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's... It's one of the things that was covered under the

2439
04:05:52,843 --> 04:05:53,183
[SPEAKER_11]: the box.

2440
04:05:53,564 --> 04:06:03,554
[SPEAKER_11]: So when we do a building site plan review, when they meet all the conditions, we sign the occupancy permit.

2441
04:06:03,985 --> 04:06:07,566
[SPEAKER_11]: And when they don't meet all the conditions, we don't sign the occupancy permit.

2442
04:06:08,526 --> 04:06:19,049
[SPEAKER_11]: In this case, because it's a subdivision, we don't have occupancy permits that we hold over their heads until everything is done to all the conditions are met.

2443
04:06:19,610 --> 04:06:24,511
[SPEAKER_11]: We hold their money, the bond, until all the conditions are met.

2444
04:06:24,771 --> 04:06:31,133
[SPEAKER_11]: So the question is, does this meet the condition that the board had intended?

2445
04:06:31,925 --> 04:06:37,329
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I did just pull up the original written conditions for this.

2446
04:06:37,349 --> 04:06:42,172
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I just want to say, like, as far as I'm concerned, yes, it meets the conditions.

2447
04:06:42,252 --> 04:06:47,056
[SPEAKER_09]: The city was involved in placement of the trees and like, let's move on.

2448
04:06:47,556 --> 04:06:48,077
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

2449
04:06:48,217 --> 04:06:52,200
[SPEAKER_11]: The language in the decision was a tree shall be placed at each lot.

2450
04:06:52,660 --> 04:06:56,603
[SPEAKER_11]: That does not state that it should be in the right of way.

2451
04:06:56,623 --> 04:06:59,725
[SPEAKER_11]: And it doesn't state that it's on the private property.

2452
04:07:00,643 --> 04:07:06,210
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, so actually, at each lot seems to be the condition seems to have been met.

2453
04:07:08,752 --> 04:07:13,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, yeah, I just, we discussed it, you know, four years ago, three years ago.

2454
04:07:13,918 --> 04:07:16,041
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, just want confirmation.

2455
04:07:16,101 --> 04:07:20,786
[SPEAKER_07]: So when the tree warden looks at it, it doesn't come back up and then we're held back another month because of it.

2456
04:07:22,109 --> 04:07:23,710
[SPEAKER_07]: So far, okay, how it is.

2457
04:07:23,730 --> 04:07:25,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it shows in the plan.

2458
04:07:25,171 --> 04:07:30,574
[SPEAKER_05]: So Ben, if the trees are planted, the tree warden signs off and they pull off the estimate, because they're there, they meet it, so.

2459
04:07:31,234 --> 04:07:35,437
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so unless any board member speaks up, I'm just gonna say yes, the condition has been met.

2460
04:07:38,399 --> 04:07:40,800
[SPEAKER_17]: Not much, I don't think there's much more we can do at this point.

2461
04:07:40,820 --> 04:07:42,561
[SPEAKER_17]: It sounds like it was met at the time of.

2462
04:07:46,223 --> 04:07:48,485
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, do you wanna keep going through the list?

2463
04:07:49,477 --> 04:07:49,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, please.

2464
04:07:50,838 --> 04:07:53,720
[SPEAKER_07]: New stonebound located sunk beneath the ground surface.

2465
04:07:54,040 --> 04:08:00,303
[SPEAKER_07]: That stonebound did sink again, so we're going to lift that back up to grade and then reset the drill hole.

2466
04:08:04,426 --> 04:08:05,907
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll skip over the driveway aprons.

2467
04:08:05,927 --> 04:08:07,288
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll talk about that one in more detail.

2468
04:08:07,888 --> 04:08:10,249
[SPEAKER_07]: Stormwater system shall be inspected and maintained.

2469
04:08:10,770 --> 04:08:17,914
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll do an inspection on the stormwater system as well as get the updated as-built information on the stormwater structures.

2470
04:08:18,688 --> 04:08:21,789
[SPEAKER_07]: for that weir that Tim commented on later on.

2471
04:08:23,410 --> 04:08:26,431
[SPEAKER_07]: The straw waddles and silt fencing, we will remove that as well.

2472
04:08:29,432 --> 04:08:36,834
[SPEAKER_07]: Backup generators, John, do you have any pictures or anything right now or are you going to submit that after the fact for the backup generators?

2473
04:08:41,310 --> 04:08:43,071
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't have any pictures of that right now.

2474
04:08:43,292 --> 04:08:44,793
[SPEAKER_00]: I can submit some pictures I have.

2475
04:08:45,273 --> 04:08:47,054
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought generators for all three houses.

2476
04:08:48,155 --> 04:08:51,177
[SPEAKER_00]: They have that they have the panel everything is hooked up in the back of the house.

2477
04:08:51,878 --> 04:08:56,641
[SPEAKER_00]: All they're going to do is just plug in to the panel and plug into the generator and the pumps will pump.

2478
04:08:59,303 --> 04:09:02,926
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have seen that for a lot one just haven't looked at it for data lots.

2479
04:09:09,210 --> 04:09:11,752
[SPEAKER_07]: The decorative stone on the side of the roadway.

2480
04:09:13,813 --> 04:09:19,015
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess we'd like input from the board, whether that's acceptable or not.

2481
04:09:19,235 --> 04:09:22,757
[SPEAKER_07]: It's come at PL7 from Tim McGiburn.

2482
04:09:25,939 --> 04:09:27,640
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks fine to me.

2483
04:09:27,680 --> 04:09:28,460
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks nice.

2484
04:09:28,500 --> 04:09:29,821
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's easy to maintain.

2485
04:09:30,121 --> 04:09:33,622
[SPEAKER_09]: Otherwise, I don't know who's going to be responsible for maintaining that strip.

2486
04:09:34,463 --> 04:09:36,544
[SPEAKER_09]: Does any board member, anybody else care?

2487
04:09:39,209 --> 04:09:39,329
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

2488
04:09:41,430 --> 04:09:42,290
[SPEAKER_09]: So thumbs up.

2489
04:09:43,811 --> 04:09:44,051
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

2490
04:09:44,071 --> 04:09:44,271
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2491
04:09:44,291 --> 04:09:50,974
[SPEAKER_07]: We, I mean, we kind of think that's the way to go to, I mean, no, none of the residents probably want to maintain that.

2492
04:09:51,654 --> 04:09:52,935
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's probably easier.

2493
04:09:54,516 --> 04:09:55,896
[SPEAKER_07]: Roman seed would discuss that.

2494
04:09:55,916 --> 04:10:01,278
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2495
04:10:01,599 --> 04:10:03,419
[SPEAKER_07]: As they'll plan, we'll update that accordingly.

2496
04:10:04,260 --> 04:10:04,620
[SPEAKER_07]: And then

2497
04:10:05,870 --> 04:10:14,214
[SPEAKER_07]: The chambers for each lot, as Mr. McGivern commented, I've already made those changes to the as-built plan while we've been waiting, so that's all set.

2498
04:10:14,234 --> 04:10:18,977
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll just go back to the items we wanted to discuss in more detail.

2499
04:10:21,918 --> 04:10:27,941
[SPEAKER_07]: So the big one being the underground service, underground electric service for lot one, which is 20 Macklin Road.

2500
04:10:28,681 --> 04:10:33,104
[SPEAKER_07]: So lots two and three, which are 30 and 40 Macklin Road were sold

2501
04:10:34,909 --> 04:10:39,372
[SPEAKER_07]: About at the start of the time lot one was started, the building was started.

2502
04:10:39,432 --> 04:10:43,915
[SPEAKER_07]: So those temporary electric services were already in and then underground.

2503
04:10:44,835 --> 04:10:48,477
[SPEAKER_07]: So they went up to the pole, the existing utility pole that was there.

2504
04:10:49,318 --> 04:11:00,145
[SPEAKER_07]: Then when National Grid came out to connect the service for lot one, because those services for two and three were already up the pole, they installed overhead to lot one.

2505
04:11:00,905 --> 04:11:01,165
[SPEAKER_07]: And as

2506
04:11:03,218 --> 04:11:08,261
[SPEAKER_07]: detailed by National Grid, they will only allow two vertical service connections on a single pole.

2507
04:11:09,001 --> 04:11:10,922
[SPEAKER_07]: So they went overhead for that other one.

2508
04:11:11,262 --> 04:11:31,932
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, in order to change that to underground service, we'd have to remove those two service lines on the utility pole, run a main line from the overhead down the pole to a junction box, and then run three service lines, or connect the two service lines and run one new underground service to lot one.

2509
04:11:32,468 --> 04:11:41,151
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're requesting the board waive that requirement for lot one since the overhead service is already installed, just like it is for the existing house at 10 Macklin.

2510
04:11:41,931 --> 04:11:46,072
[SPEAKER_07]: It's about a 30 foot overhead service from the pole to the house.

2511
04:11:54,495 --> 04:11:57,436
[SPEAKER_09]: Tim, do you have any concerns with that?

2512
04:11:58,515 --> 04:11:59,195
[SPEAKER_05]: really concerns.

2513
04:11:59,255 --> 04:12:01,396
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just it's it's shown in the plan is underground.

2514
04:12:01,776 --> 04:12:14,359
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody's known that it was going into underground and the difference the really the I mean, they're talking about installing the junction splice box somewhere, you know, on the ground and having the three services come out of that as opposed to it.

2515
04:12:16,160 --> 04:12:19,961
[SPEAKER_05]: To be honest here, it's it shows a little bit of lack of planning here.

2516
04:12:19,981 --> 04:12:23,182
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, this product knew that all three houses should have underground services.

2517
04:12:23,642 --> 04:12:25,342
[SPEAKER_05]: I prefer underground services.

2518
04:12:25,382 --> 04:12:26,703
[SPEAKER_05]: I think all services should be underground.

2519
04:12:28,387 --> 04:12:31,568
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's up to the board if they want to waive that.

2520
04:12:32,188 --> 04:12:38,129
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, the house has power, and two out of the three homes were done with underground services.

2521
04:12:41,090 --> 04:12:42,390
[SPEAKER_05]: The plan says all three.

2522
04:12:42,551 --> 04:12:46,692
[SPEAKER_05]: And when I look at it, I say, why weren't all three done?

2523
04:12:46,732 --> 04:12:47,612
[SPEAKER_05]: Why wasn't this planned for?

2524
04:12:48,992 --> 04:12:50,072
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's kind of where I'm at.

2525
04:12:51,253 --> 04:12:52,473
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they should install that third one.

2526
04:12:54,467 --> 04:13:06,751
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can say something, when we were going to do underground onto lot one as well, National Grid kind of trumped on the plans and basically told us we can't, you can only do two per pole.

2527
04:13:07,971 --> 04:13:11,713
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, National Grid told us that, so they went overhead there.

2528
04:13:13,733 --> 04:13:19,275
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just, I mean, if that's the law, that's what they, they didn't tell me anything about a junction box at that time.

2529
04:13:20,177 --> 04:13:27,858
[SPEAKER_00]: They just said that we can only put two risers on a pole for safety reasons, for climbing, if you have to climb up, whatever, you know, the other reasons.

2530
04:13:28,638 --> 04:13:30,099
[SPEAKER_00]: So they went overhead there.

2531
04:13:30,359 --> 04:13:31,259
[SPEAKER_00]: That wasn't my call.

2532
04:13:36,360 --> 04:13:39,540
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, any board members have an opinion?

2533
04:13:39,620 --> 04:13:44,721
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, the house has power.

2534
04:13:44,881 --> 04:13:49,422
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm inclined to just go ahead with it and waive it.

2535
04:13:49,947 --> 04:14:06,653
[SPEAKER_17]: I just wanted to speak on our but dealing with utility coordination, it goes back to what Mr. McGovern has already said, McGovern has already said it's kind of like a lack of planning because if you do a utility relocation, or coordination, you're already having those discussions with all utility persons ahead of time.

2536
04:14:06,893 --> 04:14:08,974
[SPEAKER_17]: So you didn't find out until after it was required.

2537
04:14:11,705 --> 04:14:17,069
[SPEAKER_00]: that day when they put the services in they told us they can only do two underground services.

2538
04:14:17,109 --> 04:14:21,333
[SPEAKER_00]: It was only one pole there and they said we can only run two underground services from that pole.

2539
04:14:21,733 --> 04:14:25,056
[SPEAKER_00]: This last house is a short run so we're going to go overhead from it.

2540
04:14:25,296 --> 04:14:26,156
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they told me.

2541
04:14:26,277 --> 04:14:33,582
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't work for National Grid and we have a letter from the engineer from National Grid that we submitted saying that.

2542
04:14:34,143 --> 04:14:35,384
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Chair, may I respond?

2543
04:14:36,128 --> 04:14:37,968
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, sure, Mr. McGeevan.

2544
04:14:38,489 --> 04:14:43,490
[SPEAKER_05]: John, I mean, you know, I understand what you're saying, but at the same time, I mean, I do this work, too.

2545
04:14:43,610 --> 04:14:47,951
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you tell National Grid that you need three underground services.

2546
04:14:48,031 --> 04:14:48,331
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

2547
04:14:49,131 --> 04:14:53,512
[SPEAKER_05]: And so when you told me that they said they couldn't do it, I said, OK, show me in writing.

2548
04:14:54,253 --> 04:14:57,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Then the writing that I got from National Grid said that they could do it.

2549
04:14:57,753 --> 04:14:59,194
[SPEAKER_05]: They just need to install a junction box.

2550
04:15:00,049 --> 04:15:05,274
[SPEAKER_00]: So well, I think I think what no, well, this is that's exactly the truth.

2551
04:15:05,314 --> 04:15:07,816
[SPEAKER_00]: What they said that I told they saw the plans.

2552
04:15:08,096 --> 04:15:10,759
[SPEAKER_00]: They said I said we needed three, three underground services.

2553
04:15:11,459 --> 04:15:13,741
[SPEAKER_00]: But they said that they that's what they told me.

2554
04:15:14,142 --> 04:15:21,368
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the letter later on by the engineer, whether it is to say that there is an ultimate way to do it was after the fact.

2555
04:15:22,229 --> 04:15:25,912
[SPEAKER_00]: When he when when he wrote that letter a few weeks ago, when you requested a letter from

2556
04:15:28,379 --> 04:15:32,781
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, I think we're just at the point.

2557
04:15:33,401 --> 04:15:38,263
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we're just at the point, well, we agree, the plan said underground service.

2558
04:15:39,363 --> 04:15:39,903
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the case.

2559
04:15:40,023 --> 04:15:43,345
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it worth it at this point to dig a trench and do all that work?

2560
04:15:43,645 --> 04:15:48,166
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's just the board's decision and we're at the point it's already installed.

2561
04:15:48,407 --> 04:15:49,807
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it worth to go back and do it?

2562
04:15:50,367 --> 04:15:52,108
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what we're asking for guidance on.

2563
04:15:54,299 --> 04:15:56,601
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm inclined to just let it go the way it is.

2564
04:15:56,641 --> 04:15:58,122
[SPEAKER_09]: The power's already installed.

2565
04:15:58,202 --> 04:16:03,366
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a short distance, but any board members have a strong opinion?

2566
04:16:04,087 --> 04:16:06,329
[SPEAKER_11]: One question.

2567
04:16:06,449 --> 04:16:09,912
[SPEAKER_11]: Tim provided a detailed estimates for all of this stuff.

2568
04:16:10,912 --> 04:16:16,477
[SPEAKER_11]: Is this argument over $2,100 worth of work, or would it be more than that at this point?

2569
04:16:17,818 --> 04:16:18,879
[SPEAKER_00]: For the underground service?

2570
04:16:19,960 --> 04:16:20,680
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be a lot more than 2100.

2571
04:16:20,820 --> 04:16:22,341
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, underground.

2572
04:16:22,821 --> 04:16:26,503
[SPEAKER_17]: I would be really shocked if undergrounding was on 2100.

2573
04:16:27,443 --> 04:16:28,524
[SPEAKER_00]: It's well over.

2574
04:16:28,864 --> 04:16:30,445
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's a lot of ledge in there.

2575
04:16:30,485 --> 04:16:33,146
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd have to be blasting this roof from that pole to the house.

2576
04:16:33,686 --> 04:16:36,908
[SPEAKER_00]: When we put the temporary service underground service in, there was ledge there.

2577
04:16:37,808 --> 04:16:38,689
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still ledge there.

2578
04:16:39,569 --> 04:16:41,670
[SPEAKER_00]: But that wasn't the reason why we didn't go underground.

2579
04:16:41,690 --> 04:16:43,391
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason was for the reason I stated.

2580
04:16:44,074 --> 04:16:47,256
[SPEAKER_00]: but it would be a lot more than $2,100 to put on the ground.

2581
04:16:47,276 --> 04:16:50,779
[SPEAKER_00]: Just cost of electric supplies is gonna be well over that.

2582
04:16:51,600 --> 04:16:52,720
[SPEAKER_00]: Nevermind the excavation.

2583
04:16:52,740 --> 04:16:58,044
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that was, I just took our original estimate and divided by three, Alicia.

2584
04:16:58,545 --> 04:17:02,968
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's 70 foot per linear foot for trenching.

2585
04:17:03,848 --> 04:17:12,675
[SPEAKER_05]: And typically the electrical equipment goes in by the provider and then the work to get

2586
04:17:13,230 --> 04:17:20,515
[SPEAKER_05]: it in, the excavation, the backfill, if there's concrete that needs to be poured or whatever, is done by the project, typically.

2587
04:17:25,359 --> 04:17:32,264
[SPEAKER_17]: We've already sold about a million and five, just a small project for underground utilities before, just to give you an idea.

2588
04:17:32,544 --> 04:17:33,725
[SPEAKER_17]: So depending on linear feet.

2589
04:17:34,305 --> 04:17:35,686
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's well over 2100.

2590
04:17:39,542 --> 04:17:42,884
[SPEAKER_09]: So Cles and David, I see both you guys unmuted.

2591
04:17:42,904 --> 04:17:44,745
[SPEAKER_09]: You wanna make any comments, either one?

2592
04:17:47,507 --> 04:17:49,708
[SPEAKER_03]: Andres, David, I would not waive this.

2593
04:17:52,150 --> 04:17:53,030
[SPEAKER_09]: You would not waive it.

2594
04:17:55,912 --> 04:17:56,112
[SPEAKER_09]: Cles?

2595
04:17:56,132 --> 04:17:56,993
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm leaning that way too.

2596
04:18:00,798 --> 04:18:18,013
[SPEAKER_17]: And Andre, I don't know if you can tell by my questions, I'm kind of leaning back because I'm going back to the November 20th meeting and also even January and it's like each time there's been some back and forth with just some of the city's recommendations from Mr. McGivern.

2597
04:18:18,253 --> 04:18:25,039
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm just wondering if this is a trend and going back and forth with not wanting to

2598
04:18:26,964 --> 04:18:28,064
[SPEAKER_17]: We've let a lot slide.

2599
04:18:29,385 --> 04:18:34,806
[SPEAKER_17]: And I understand that we can't go back and change things from the beginning but this one right here, six, it's big.

2600
04:18:35,726 --> 04:18:41,788
[SPEAKER_17]: And I don't want to continue to allow things to slide with this kind of impact.

2601
04:18:46,849 --> 04:18:50,510
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, we received, we granted approval based on something.

2602
04:18:51,150 --> 04:18:54,151
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's not what was done.

2603
04:18:57,672 --> 04:19:01,115
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it was what National Grid told us they were going to do.

2604
04:19:03,278 --> 04:19:07,922
[SPEAKER_00]: It had nothing to do with any of us making any calls on this.

2605
04:19:28,392 --> 04:19:28,972
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know.

2606
04:19:29,273 --> 04:19:31,074
[SPEAKER_14]: It's tough.

2607
04:19:34,696 --> 04:19:38,098
[SPEAKER_25]: I guess I'm with Andre and at this point.

2608
04:19:44,102 --> 04:19:47,104
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want to go over the other ones and come back to this at the end?

2609
04:19:48,224 --> 04:19:51,466
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2610
04:19:51,506 --> 04:19:56,069
[SPEAKER_07]: Next one is the driveway aprons for lots one and two.

2611
04:19:58,912 --> 04:20:07,197
[SPEAKER_07]: So I believe Tim McGivern went and measured the slopes where the sidewalks go across the driveway.

2612
04:20:08,137 --> 04:20:11,419
[SPEAKER_07]: So there are no aprons right now for those lots.

2613
04:20:12,019 --> 04:20:18,523
[SPEAKER_07]: And Tim's comment is that you need aprons to meet the cross slope for that sidewalk across.

2614
04:20:21,369 --> 04:20:25,953
[SPEAKER_07]: And then also along with that was another comment about 93 Winslow, which didn't have aprons.

2615
04:20:26,113 --> 04:20:28,835
[SPEAKER_07]: And that one was, those were supposed to be provided aprons.

2616
04:20:29,475 --> 04:20:36,181
[SPEAKER_07]: So I believe John's already had discussions with the paper to get those accomplished.

2617
04:20:36,641 --> 04:20:40,644
[SPEAKER_07]: But I guess we just want confirmation on what's gonna be required for all of those driveways.

2618
04:20:44,027 --> 04:20:50,872
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just going off the, not only the detail that's shown on your drawings, but the rules for accessibility.

2619
04:20:52,322 --> 04:20:58,547
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you need to have less than 2% cross slopes on the pedestrian crossings, minimum three foot width.

2620
04:20:59,108 --> 04:21:07,114
[SPEAKER_05]: We like to see four feet, but three feet's acceptable, but it needs to be from one driveway to the other, just like the sidewalks.

2621
04:21:11,718 --> 04:21:14,060
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, I mean, that seems straightforward.

2622
04:21:14,080 --> 04:21:17,223
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have a problem with that?

2623
04:21:21,952 --> 04:21:23,073
[SPEAKER_09]: proponent, applicant.

2624
04:21:24,033 --> 04:21:25,734
[SPEAKER_07]: John, any comments on that?

2625
04:21:25,754 --> 04:21:29,996
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, I was still thinking about the underground.

2626
04:21:31,917 --> 04:21:34,779
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so 93 Winslow, the existing house.

2627
04:21:36,040 --> 04:21:38,261
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, we need the aprons there to keep water away.

2628
04:21:38,621 --> 04:21:39,482
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are supposed to get them.

2629
04:21:40,602 --> 04:21:42,043
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we've worked with the paper.

2630
04:21:42,063 --> 04:21:42,923
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to get that done.

2631
04:21:43,224 --> 04:21:46,265
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the other two driveways, it's really not that much.

2632
04:21:46,445 --> 04:21:48,627
[SPEAKER_07]: It's only about an inch, two inches of pavement.

2633
04:21:50,506 --> 04:21:52,548
[SPEAKER_07]: know, 20 feet wide, three feet across.

2634
04:21:52,568 --> 04:21:56,591
[SPEAKER_07]: So since they're already out there for the other ones, it's it's not that much more.

2635
04:21:56,611 --> 04:21:58,832
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, to take care of do that.

2636
04:22:00,394 --> 04:22:03,136
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, that doesn't fly anywhere in the city.

2637
04:22:03,196 --> 04:22:10,061
[SPEAKER_05]: So just so you guys know, like, that doesn't fly like you need to have one, you know, to less than 2% cross slopes on all your pedestrian walkways.

2638
04:22:10,261 --> 04:22:10,862
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, I understand.

2639
04:22:11,302 --> 04:22:11,462
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

2640
04:22:12,103 --> 04:22:12,863
[SPEAKER_05]: You might as well check.

2641
04:22:12,903 --> 04:22:14,304
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I just spot check them.

2642
04:22:14,384 --> 04:22:18,267
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's your responsibility to make sure that they meet it.

2643
04:22:18,287 --> 04:22:19,068
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

2644
04:22:25,416 --> 04:22:26,917
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there another one coming back?

2645
04:22:27,737 --> 04:22:28,938
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I didn't mean to trouble you.

2646
04:22:30,218 --> 04:22:31,479
[SPEAKER_05]: That's okay.

2647
04:22:31,499 --> 04:22:34,981
[SPEAKER_07]: The last, which is coming back to the electric, was the only other one.

2648
04:22:39,003 --> 04:22:41,604
[SPEAKER_09]: Just, you mean the underground, overground, above ground?

2649
04:22:42,284 --> 04:22:43,125
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the last issue.

2650
04:22:52,945 --> 04:22:57,609
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, we seem to have kind of a divided board on this.

2651
04:22:58,650 --> 04:23:02,834
[SPEAKER_09]: Christy, Jackie, in which way are you guys falling?

2652
04:23:02,854 --> 04:23:09,940
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry, I'm just reading the summary again.

2653
04:23:18,220 --> 04:23:20,382
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, we've seen this project so many times, honest to God.

2654
04:23:20,422 --> 04:23:21,263
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want it done.

2655
04:23:21,283 --> 04:23:24,585
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to like, the electricity's already there.

2656
04:23:24,805 --> 04:23:26,147
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's just, I don't want to see it again.

2657
04:23:31,111 --> 04:23:33,373
[SPEAKER_17]: And why are we forcing it to underground?

2658
04:23:33,773 --> 04:23:41,559
[SPEAKER_17]: Was there an actual, usually it's an aesthetic purpose, but Tim, can you remind us why?

2659
04:23:44,001 --> 04:23:45,683
[SPEAKER_05]: What the benefits to underground services are?

2660
04:23:46,529 --> 04:23:46,849
[SPEAKER_17]: No, no, no.

2661
04:23:46,909 --> 04:23:50,231
[SPEAKER_17]: I know that I just wanted for this one outside of the aesthetic purpose.

2662
04:23:50,271 --> 04:23:52,633
[SPEAKER_17]: I didn't know if there was a specific purpose for this one.

2663
04:23:53,613 --> 04:23:55,214
[SPEAKER_05]: I would ask you that question.

2664
04:23:55,234 --> 04:23:56,895
[SPEAKER_05]: I would ask the board that question.

2665
04:23:56,915 --> 04:23:58,496
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't here during the approval process.

2666
04:23:59,717 --> 04:24:05,460
[SPEAKER_05]: But basically what I'm going by on is just the endorsed approved plan has underground services for all the homes.

2667
04:24:06,361 --> 04:24:08,062
[SPEAKER_05]: I personally prefer underground services.

2668
04:24:08,182 --> 04:24:10,383
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish all overhead wires were underground.

2669
04:24:11,043 --> 04:24:15,027
[SPEAKER_05]: In general, so I that's where I fall on this on this sort of thing.

2670
04:24:15,847 --> 04:24:21,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to kind of give folks an idea of what typically happens in this in a situation like this.

2671
04:24:22,192 --> 04:24:33,842
[SPEAKER_05]: If a developer is executing a project and they run into something that doesn't meet the plan, especially an endorsed approved subdivision plan, which is as good as regulation, and it doesn't, they can't do it.

2672
04:24:34,741 --> 04:24:40,763
[SPEAKER_05]: then they're supposed to come to the board, have that discussion, and then it gets sussed out then, well, why can't you do it?

2673
04:24:40,803 --> 04:24:41,803
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the documentation?

2674
04:24:41,843 --> 04:24:43,083
[SPEAKER_05]: Da, da, da, da, I need a waiver.

2675
04:24:43,443 --> 04:24:44,083
[SPEAKER_05]: That didn't happen.

2676
04:24:44,123 --> 04:24:51,885
[SPEAKER_05]: So instead it's 11th hour, couldn't do it, and then get an email from National Grid that says, well, you could have done it.

2677
04:24:52,225 --> 04:24:55,406
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, just trying to frame the picture.

2678
04:24:55,746 --> 04:24:56,566
[SPEAKER_16]: So I have a question.

2679
04:24:56,706 --> 04:25:01,968
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, what's the burden to the developer for giving National Grid the easement?

2680
04:25:03,645 --> 04:25:11,776
[SPEAKER_16]: You know a burden on now the property and does it lower the value does it impact the owners of the parcels now I mean I don't.

2681
04:25:14,659 --> 04:25:17,343
[SPEAKER_16]: I get it there's some logistics around it but I guess if.

2682
04:25:18,984 --> 04:25:35,312
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm just trying to sway myself one way or another by just gathering a little more facts like if it's not a safety issue and it's more of an aesthetic and I understand the board approved it before to be underground, you know, that's one thing but if it's not a safety issue to have it overhead.

2683
04:25:35,332 --> 04:25:35,412
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

2684
04:25:40,105 --> 04:25:54,011
[SPEAKER_16]: Does, does the developer just not want to take the time to do it because you know we're sort of like at this home stretch or is it a burden and impact to the, to the value of the land to provide national grid with an easement.

2685
04:25:54,812 --> 04:26:00,915
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's not a matter of matter of me not wanting to put the time to do it I believe me I put the time and as you all know over there.

2686
04:26:02,440 --> 04:26:04,222
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm down to just me.

2687
04:26:04,382 --> 04:26:06,224
[SPEAKER_00]: My partner's got some issues.

2688
04:26:06,264 --> 04:26:06,804
[SPEAKER_00]: He's gone.

2689
04:26:07,064 --> 04:26:09,887
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gone to hell and back with this project.

2690
04:26:11,268 --> 04:26:16,273
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done everything I possibly can to try to do everything the right way for you guys.

2691
04:26:16,593 --> 04:26:18,134
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a big builder.

2692
04:26:19,155 --> 04:26:20,697
[SPEAKER_00]: I got three kids in college.

2693
04:26:20,717 --> 04:26:21,798
[SPEAKER_00]: They're out of college now.

2694
04:26:21,938 --> 04:26:23,479
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a blue collar guy.

2695
04:26:24,040 --> 04:26:25,461
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is all new stuff to me.

2696
04:26:25,561 --> 04:26:28,384
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I was told that National Grid trumps anything,

2697
04:26:29,298 --> 04:26:30,838
[SPEAKER_00]: that what they say goes.

2698
04:26:31,179 --> 04:26:32,819
[SPEAKER_00]: When they came there, they told me that.

2699
04:26:33,059 --> 04:26:34,340
[SPEAKER_00]: I went with what they said.

2700
04:26:34,800 --> 04:26:36,360
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right, Tim.

2701
04:26:36,500 --> 04:26:40,221
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably should have said, well, I'm going to go bring it to the board anyways.

2702
04:26:40,821 --> 04:26:46,023
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to get the last house done, and I just went with what they told me.

2703
04:26:46,963 --> 04:26:49,384
[SPEAKER_00]: That's God's honest truth, and

2704
04:26:50,625 --> 04:26:51,807
[SPEAKER_05]: I know John, I wasn't trying to rub you.

2705
04:26:51,827 --> 04:26:54,649
[SPEAKER_05]: I was trying to be general and typical on what would typically happen.

2706
04:26:54,690 --> 04:26:56,131
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't mean to point you out.

2707
04:26:56,171 --> 04:26:59,094
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand the situation for certain.

2708
04:26:59,214 --> 04:27:01,817
[SPEAKER_05]: And Ms.

2709
04:27:01,837 --> 04:27:05,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Dowd, just to comment on what you said, there is no safety issue.

2710
04:27:06,382 --> 04:27:09,425
[SPEAKER_05]: It's typically a preference, whether it goes overhead or underground.

2711
04:27:09,445 --> 04:27:12,288
[SPEAKER_05]: And then as far as easement, that would

2712
04:27:12,708 --> 04:27:14,308
[SPEAKER_05]: depending on where that junction box lands.

2713
04:27:14,409 --> 04:27:17,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Does it land in the way parcel or does it land on the building parcel?

2714
04:27:17,509 --> 04:27:20,950
[SPEAKER_05]: If it lands in the building parcel, yeah, national grids will need access to that.

2715
04:27:21,190 --> 04:27:23,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Does it reduce the value of the property?

2716
04:27:23,731 --> 04:27:24,051
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

2717
04:27:24,171 --> 04:27:29,333
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd have to ask the market if having a national grid junction box in your property reduces the value.

2718
04:27:29,433 --> 04:27:31,473
[SPEAKER_05]: It might a little bit.

2719
04:27:32,854 --> 04:27:38,696
[SPEAKER_05]: But if it's in the right of way, we have those all over the city and they're usually not that big of a deal.

2720
04:27:38,716 --> 04:27:39,816
[SPEAKER_05]: They get serviced every now and then.

2721
04:27:41,929 --> 04:27:42,589
[SPEAKER_05]: just like a poll.

2722
04:27:43,129 --> 04:27:52,812
[SPEAKER_11]: If it helps, Tim is reviewing this from the plans that were presented to him because he was not the city engineer at the time.

2723
04:27:53,412 --> 04:27:54,992
[SPEAKER_11]: I was not the community development director.

2724
04:27:55,452 --> 04:28:01,454
[SPEAKER_11]: And actually, if memory serves, very few of you were actually on this board when this was approved.

2725
04:28:02,074 --> 04:28:04,475
[SPEAKER_11]: So I did pull up the written

2726
04:28:07,535 --> 04:28:09,476
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't even come up with words at this point, sorry.

2727
04:28:09,816 --> 04:28:17,921
[SPEAKER_11]: The written conditions, the narrative conditions, and there's no mention of electrical service in the narrative conditions.

2728
04:28:18,822 --> 04:28:31,470
[SPEAKER_11]: So I didn't go back to the minutes from that meeting, but it wasn't, one would expect that if they had discussed it, it would have been something called out in the narrative.

2729
04:28:31,530 --> 04:28:34,752
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's not in the narrative of this at all.

2730
04:28:35,770 --> 04:28:41,914
[SPEAKER_07]: If I remember correctly, it was either install another pole or run underground electric.

2731
04:28:42,474 --> 04:28:48,038
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um, it basically came down and nobody wanted to add another pole to the street.

2732
04:28:48,898 --> 04:28:52,120
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so underground was ran underneath the sidewalk and around the cul-de-sac.

2733
04:28:52,961 --> 04:28:56,483
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, it wasn't about the short runs from the wires to the houses.

2734
04:28:56,503 --> 04:29:00,565
[SPEAKER_07]: It was more about adding another pole at the end of the street and having a long run from pole to pole.

2735
04:29:01,286 --> 04:29:02,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but again, I don't have that in writing.

2736
04:29:02,847 --> 04:29:05,208
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just based on my memory of that discussion.

2737
04:29:08,309 --> 04:29:11,831
[SPEAKER_07]: So you couldn't run an overhead service from the existing pole to lot three.

2738
04:29:12,571 --> 04:29:13,211
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just too long.

2739
04:29:13,231 --> 04:29:15,472
[SPEAKER_07]: You'd have to have another pole at the end of the cul-de-sac.

2740
04:29:18,073 --> 04:29:23,036
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I don't recall this being an issue that generated discussion.

2741
04:29:23,076 --> 04:29:25,096
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a lot of discussion about a lot of issues.

2742
04:29:25,137 --> 04:29:26,217
[SPEAKER_09]: This wasn't one of them.

2743
04:29:26,697 --> 04:29:31,799
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just feel like the service is there.

2744
04:29:34,303 --> 04:29:35,964
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I don't have any notes.

2745
04:29:36,925 --> 04:29:38,586
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to agree with that, Andre.

2746
04:29:38,686 --> 04:29:39,387
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't have any notes.

2747
04:29:39,427 --> 04:29:40,868
[SPEAKER_17]: I have notes on the generator.

2748
04:29:40,888 --> 04:29:42,229
[SPEAKER_17]: I have notes on the granite carbon.

2749
04:29:42,309 --> 04:29:45,911
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't have notes on this.

2750
04:29:47,152 --> 04:29:50,214
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm just going to... I'm with you now.

2751
04:29:50,435 --> 04:29:51,896
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm just going to say just go for it.

2752
04:29:53,335 --> 04:29:56,679
[SPEAKER_11]: So and at this point, what we're voting is how far to release the bond.

2753
04:29:57,219 --> 04:30:01,484
[SPEAKER_11]: And so based on the conversation we've heard tonight, I've done some calculations.

2754
04:30:02,605 --> 04:30:07,410
[SPEAKER_11]: So if we revise, Tim gave us an estimate of 19,000 without the six trees.

2755
04:30:10,705 --> 04:30:20,011
[SPEAKER_11]: But keeping everything else that he estimated, that brings a total of mobilization and contingency and a total of 12,650 on the bond.

2756
04:30:20,572 --> 04:30:28,117
[SPEAKER_11]: If we also drop this portion, the electrical underground requirement, it brings the total bond that we would continue to hold at 10,235.

2757
04:30:28,657 --> 04:30:33,720
[SPEAKER_11]: And it seems like everybody's in agreement on the other items.

2758
04:30:34,221 --> 04:30:39,845
[SPEAKER_11]: What we did on another location was then we suggested that

2759
04:30:41,104 --> 04:30:48,429
[SPEAKER_11]: based on the engineer's recommendation, the chair could administratively release the rest of the bond.

2760
04:30:49,950 --> 04:30:51,331
[SPEAKER_11]: Tim, did you have anything to add on that?

2761
04:30:52,031 --> 04:30:53,933
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to talk about the trees.

2762
04:30:54,013 --> 04:30:58,596
[SPEAKER_05]: The reason the trees are still on there is not because of the issue with the property and where they're located.

2763
04:30:58,636 --> 04:31:02,278
[SPEAKER_05]: It's because we haven't received sign-off from the tree warden on the rooting.

2764
04:31:03,119 --> 04:31:04,179
[SPEAKER_11]: Right, right.

2765
04:31:09,122 --> 04:31:15,884
[SPEAKER_11]: So you would actually keep the dollar amount until we have the letter from the tree warden saying that she has approved them.

2766
04:31:16,465 --> 04:31:17,285
[SPEAKER_09]: That is my recommendation.

2767
04:31:17,585 --> 04:31:25,849
[SPEAKER_09]: But we need to indicate to the tree warden that we are okay with four trees instead of six trees, which I think we agreed was okay.

2768
04:31:26,869 --> 04:31:33,672
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know how we communicate that, but if that could be communicated via city staff, that would be,

2769
04:31:34,919 --> 04:31:35,119
[SPEAKER_09]: right?

2770
04:31:35,359 --> 04:31:42,465
[SPEAKER_11]: And Amanda can serve well, I'd send an introduction between the proponent and the tree warden if he doesn't already have that.

2771
04:31:43,806 --> 04:31:50,030
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Max, I believe the I believe the only thing on the plans as far as the tree born is just to approve the species of maple.

2772
04:31:50,971 --> 04:31:52,652
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, not not the number of trees.

2773
04:31:52,672 --> 04:31:59,017
[SPEAKER_07]: Um so if we can agree on that, it's just that we need a letter that the tree one approves the species of tree.

2774
04:31:59,798 --> 04:32:02,680
[SPEAKER_07]: Um And then that satisfies everything.

2775
04:32:03,541 --> 04:32:03,841
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe.

2776
04:32:09,073 --> 04:32:14,977
[SPEAKER_11]: Him had mentioned that he wanted the tree warden to approve that they were rooted, that they were not gonna die on us.

2777
04:32:15,718 --> 04:32:18,220
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's just straight out of our regulations.

2778
04:32:18,900 --> 04:32:26,665
[SPEAKER_06]: And I quote, a full rooting of the new tree will be required and shall be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the tree warden.

2779
04:32:27,066 --> 04:32:29,547
[SPEAKER_06]: Straight out of section 8.33 of the subdivision rules and rights.

2780
04:32:31,789 --> 04:32:33,690
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what it's referring to, sorry.

2781
04:32:34,751 --> 04:32:36,352
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I just didn't understand, thank you.

2782
04:32:40,657 --> 04:32:48,500
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think for the purposes of the bond, then the trees stay in?

2783
04:32:52,602 --> 04:32:53,863
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be my recommendation, yeah.

2784
04:32:54,483 --> 04:32:55,984
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we've given our kind of approval to the new tree,

2785
04:33:04,380 --> 04:33:07,301
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, plan and what's been done there.

2786
04:33:08,061 --> 04:33:12,863
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we're just waiting on the, you know, the paperwork so we can release the bond.

2787
04:33:13,684 --> 04:33:16,345
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that's fine.

2788
04:33:16,365 --> 04:33:17,145
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll keep that in.

2789
04:33:17,165 --> 04:33:23,827
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we have a majority opinion now on the board to,

2790
04:33:26,084 --> 04:33:32,609
[SPEAKER_09]: wave the underground electricity for house lot number one.

2791
04:33:34,731 --> 04:33:35,651
[SPEAKER_09]: So that can come out.

2792
04:33:37,333 --> 04:33:41,456
[SPEAKER_09]: And then what does that bring us to in terms of the bond?

2793
04:33:42,056 --> 04:33:44,118
[SPEAKER_11]: Just the electricity being waived.

2794
04:33:44,258 --> 04:33:45,519
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to do the math in a minute.

2795
04:33:45,559 --> 04:33:53,545
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just looking to see if the letter that they requested, if we have an idea of what the total bond is that we're releasing.

2796
04:33:56,067 --> 04:33:59,055
[SPEAKER_11]: The letter doesn't mention it.

2797
04:33:59,075 --> 04:34:01,401
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, it did not.

2798
04:34:54,910 --> 04:35:03,777
[SPEAKER_11]: 17,135 is the bond that we would continue to hold, that we would release the rest.

2799
04:35:04,918 --> 04:35:07,680
[SPEAKER_11]: I honestly don't have in front of me what our current bond is.

2800
04:35:12,918 --> 04:35:13,478
[SPEAKER_09]: It's 194,000 something.

2801
04:35:13,498 --> 04:35:15,799
[SPEAKER_09]: So you said, did you say, what was the total again, Alicia?

2802
04:35:15,819 --> 04:35:18,739
[SPEAKER_09]: $17,135 is that what we would continue to hold and we would release the rest of it.

2803
04:35:18,759 --> 04:35:21,379
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we have a motion from a member of the board to release all but 17,000

2804
04:35:42,652 --> 04:35:50,473
[SPEAKER_09]: 154.

2805
04:35:45,112 --> 04:35:50,473
[SPEAKER_09]: 35.

2806
04:35:45,132 --> 04:35:50,473
[SPEAKER_09]: 17,000.

2807
04:35:50,133 --> 04:35:50,473
[SPEAKER_09]: What's that?

2808
04:35:51,454 --> 04:35:52,294
[SPEAKER_09]: I will make that motion.

2809
04:35:52,894 --> 04:35:53,414
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Klaas.

2810
04:35:53,474 --> 04:35:54,554
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a second?

2811
04:35:54,994 --> 04:35:55,554
[SPEAKER_25]: I'll second.

2812
04:35:56,434 --> 04:35:57,135
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Deanna.

2813
04:35:57,155 --> 04:35:59,195
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, roll call vote.

2814
04:35:59,255 --> 04:36:00,075
[SPEAKER_09]: Klaas Andreassen?

2815
04:36:01,255 --> 04:36:01,355
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

2816
04:36:02,335 --> 04:36:03,036
[SPEAKER_09]: David Blumberg?

2817
04:36:04,336 --> 04:36:04,436
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

2818
04:36:05,376 --> 04:36:05,976
[SPEAKER_09]: Christy Dowd?

2819
04:36:07,956 --> 04:36:08,076
[SPEAKER_17]: Aye.

2820
04:36:09,217 --> 04:36:09,857
[SPEAKER_09]: Deanna Peabody?

2821
04:36:10,777 --> 04:36:10,837
[SPEAKER_17]: Aye.

2822
04:36:11,979 --> 04:36:12,759
[SPEAKER_09]: Jackie Furtado?

2823
04:36:12,779 --> 04:36:16,121
[SPEAKER_17]: Aye.

2824
04:36:17,362 --> 04:36:18,322
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm an aye as well.

2825
04:36:19,163 --> 04:36:27,047
[SPEAKER_09]: Board approves unanimously releasing all but $17,035 of the bond.

2826
04:36:27,787 --> 04:36:41,674
[SPEAKER_11]: And does the board want them to come back to have that last $17,000 released, or do you want to do it administratively with him approving, well, and us, between us approving that they have

2827
04:36:43,147 --> 04:36:46,789
[SPEAKER_11]: completed everything on this list, and then the chair signs off on it.

2828
04:36:48,369 --> 04:36:52,051
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it should be done administratively for such a small amount of money.

2829
04:36:53,792 --> 04:36:54,512
[SPEAKER_11]: I second that.

2830
04:36:55,733 --> 04:36:58,074
[SPEAKER_09]: To make a formal motion on that, Alicia?

2831
04:36:59,935 --> 04:37:00,775
[SPEAKER_11]: I think you do.

2832
04:37:00,835 --> 04:37:05,457
[SPEAKER_11]: I think you should just vote right now to give permission to do it administratively.

2833
04:37:05,637 --> 04:37:09,819
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, to release the rest of the bond administratively, subject to chair approval.

2834
04:37:10,359 --> 04:37:11,700
[SPEAKER_09]: And is there, will someone make a motion

2835
04:37:14,282 --> 04:37:14,943
[SPEAKER_18]: I will make a motion.

2836
04:37:15,883 --> 04:37:16,464
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks, class.

2837
04:37:16,704 --> 04:37:18,225
[SPEAKER_09]: And I see Jackie second.

2838
04:37:18,525 --> 04:37:19,346
[SPEAKER_14]: I second.

2839
04:37:20,047 --> 04:37:20,407
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

2840
04:37:21,688 --> 04:37:22,408
[SPEAKER_09]: Roll call vote.

2841
04:37:22,509 --> 04:37:23,249
[SPEAKER_09]: Class Andreessen.

2842
04:37:23,269 --> 04:37:24,330
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

2843
04:37:25,091 --> 04:37:25,771
[SPEAKER_09]: David Blumberg.

2844
04:37:26,452 --> 04:37:26,632
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

2845
04:37:27,533 --> 04:37:28,133
[SPEAKER_09]: Christy Dowd.

2846
04:37:28,153 --> 04:37:29,214
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

2847
04:37:29,954 --> 04:37:30,775
[SPEAKER_09]: Jackie Furtado.

2848
04:37:31,596 --> 04:37:31,716
[SPEAKER_17]: Aye.

2849
04:37:32,476 --> 04:37:33,137
[SPEAKER_09]: Deanna Peabody.

2850
04:37:33,157 --> 04:37:34,118
[SPEAKER_17]: Aye.

2851
04:37:34,938 --> 04:37:37,641
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm an aye as well.

2852
04:37:37,701 --> 04:37:38,401
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

2853
04:37:41,203 --> 04:37:41,564
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

2854
04:37:44,802 --> 04:37:50,867
[SPEAKER_09]: appreciate everybody's patience with this, and thanks for waiting so long, John and Benjamin.

2855
04:37:51,948 --> 04:37:52,509
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, guys.

2856
04:37:54,110 --> 04:38:01,016
[SPEAKER_07]: And Tim, I guess we'll reach out to you for a final inspection and I'll resubmit the as-built plan when everything's all set.

2857
04:38:01,596 --> 04:38:02,017
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds good.

2858
04:38:02,897 --> 04:38:03,818
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, thank you very much.

2859
04:38:04,739 --> 04:38:05,300
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks, everyone.

2860
04:38:06,741 --> 04:38:08,382
[SPEAKER_09]: Good night.

2861
04:38:09,483 --> 04:38:13,647
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, I think we can...

2862
04:38:16,969 --> 04:38:26,932
[SPEAKER_09]: continue the next item on the agenda to review and approve the revised rules and regulations of the Medford Community Development Board Governing Organization and Procedure.

2863
04:38:26,952 --> 04:38:31,934
[SPEAKER_09]: If nobody has a problem, let's just continue that to the next meeting.

2864
04:38:31,954 --> 04:38:35,695
[SPEAKER_09]: I see some thumbs up, excellent.

2865
04:38:36,956 --> 04:38:46,179
[SPEAKER_09]: And then miscellaneous, can we also continue this or is there something that we need to address here, Alicia?

2866
04:38:46,928 --> 04:38:52,411
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just going to tell you, you guys had approved BJ's.

2867
04:38:52,591 --> 04:39:01,115
[SPEAKER_11]: You may have seen that their gas station permit was denied by the council that is now being appealed through the courts.

2868
04:39:01,695 --> 04:39:09,779
[SPEAKER_11]: So they're going to need an extension of the permit from this board because they had one year to begin construction.

2869
04:39:10,279 --> 04:39:12,220
[SPEAKER_11]: Their permits can expire in September.

2870
04:39:12,320 --> 04:39:15,602
[SPEAKER_11]: So on the next hearing, that'll come in front of you.

2871
04:39:17,807 --> 04:39:26,331
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think the other thing is that the city board terms that I, things that just, the mayor didn't have time to address this while we were dealing with the budget.

2872
04:39:27,252 --> 04:39:28,973
[SPEAKER_11]: I've made some recommendations to her.

2873
04:39:29,493 --> 04:39:42,100
[SPEAKER_11]: We also got legal counsel formally informed us that everybody's term, you stay a member, you stay your position unless somebody else is appointed in your place.

2874
04:39:42,620 --> 04:39:46,622
[SPEAKER_11]: And so hold over, it's a very standard legal thing with boards and commissions.

2875
04:39:47,653 --> 04:40:01,347
[SPEAKER_11]: So we weren't concerned about everybody or half of the board expiring on the mayor plans to have made recommendations to her and she plans to get back to me about her recommend her what she's going to do by the end of this week.

2876
04:40:03,450 --> 04:40:06,652
[SPEAKER_17]: So at least I have a question on that for myself.

2877
04:40:06,832 --> 04:40:15,378
[SPEAKER_17]: So say for instance, the governor, I mean, cause mine doesn't expire until the mayor's term expires.

2878
04:40:15,518 --> 04:40:23,563
[SPEAKER_17]: And maybe I know she's running again, but I'm just wondering, I'm sort of in the crossroads and I just, should I just sit still?

2879
04:40:23,903 --> 04:40:29,147
[SPEAKER_17]: But even if it did expire in January, do I have to scramble to try to figure out

2880
04:40:30,389 --> 04:40:32,110
[SPEAKER_11]: my next I just don't know.

2881
04:40:32,350 --> 04:40:33,811
[SPEAKER_11]: And you're appointed by the governor.

2882
04:40:33,831 --> 04:40:35,793
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know how that mechanism worked.

2883
04:40:36,933 --> 04:40:39,535
[SPEAKER_11]: But I assume things at a state level take time.

2884
04:40:40,036 --> 04:40:45,559
[SPEAKER_11]: If we wanted to put in sort of initiate that process now and not wait till January.

2885
04:40:45,579 --> 04:40:48,801
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that would be a very appropriate thing to do.

2886
04:40:49,262 --> 04:40:52,864
[SPEAKER_11]: If you wanted to be reappointed by the governor, we should initiate that process.

2887
04:40:53,264 --> 04:40:58,528
[SPEAKER_11]: If you do not want to be reappointed by the governor, then we should begin a process to have a new appoint

2888
04:40:59,117 --> 04:41:01,321
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going on vacation on Saturday.

2889
04:41:01,341 --> 04:41:01,481
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay?

2890
04:41:01,501 --> 04:41:01,742
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

2891
04:41:13,592 --> 04:41:15,993
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, well, thank you, everybody.

2892
04:41:16,393 --> 04:41:17,893
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, this was a long meeting again.

2893
04:41:17,953 --> 04:41:23,155
[SPEAKER_09]: I know we had a string of them earlier in the year, and we kind of decided to avoid that.

2894
04:41:23,595 --> 04:41:42,280
[SPEAKER_09]: I think, you know, I've talked to the CD staff, and this was a little inevitable, but, you know, I've asked them to, that we'd rather have an extra meeting during the month than have a long meeting like this, and it's limited to one public hearing per meeting.

2895
04:41:43,185 --> 04:41:44,025
[SPEAKER_09]: So just so you know.

2896
04:41:45,966 --> 04:41:48,868
[SPEAKER_09]: So thanks for your patience and for hanging in there so late.

2897
04:41:50,749 --> 04:41:51,129
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

2898
04:41:51,409 --> 04:41:52,650
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a motion to adjourn the meeting?

2899
04:41:53,830 --> 04:41:54,611
[SPEAKER_09]: I will make a motion.

2900
04:41:55,351 --> 04:41:56,132
[SPEAKER_09]: And second.

2901
04:41:56,672 --> 04:41:57,752
[SPEAKER_09]: Second by David.

2902
04:41:57,792 --> 04:41:58,233
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

04:41:58,653 --> 04:41:59,253
[SPEAKER_09]: Roll call vote.

[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

2906
04:42:01,955 --> 04:42:02,655
[SPEAKER_09]: David Blumberg.

2907
04:42:03,295 --> 04:42:03,415
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

2908
04:42:04,036 --> 04:42:04,656
[SPEAKER_09]: Christy Dowd.

2909
04:42:05,737 --> 04:42:05,897
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

2910
04:42:06,517 --> 04:42:07,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Jackie Furtado.

2911
04:42:07,998 --> 04:42:08,178
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

2912
04:42:08,838 --> 04:42:09,478
[SPEAKER_09]: Yenna Peabody.

2913
04:42:10,279 --> 04:42:10,359
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

2914
04:42:11,133 --> 04:42:11,876
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm an eye as well.

2915
04:42:11,996 --> 04:42:13,261
[SPEAKER_09]: So meeting is adjourned.

2916
04:42:13,381 --> 04:42:14,044
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks everyone.
