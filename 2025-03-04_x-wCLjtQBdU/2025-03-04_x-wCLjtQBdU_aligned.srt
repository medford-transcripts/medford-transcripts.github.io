00:00:24,533 --> 00:00:31,335
Hello, everyone, and welcome to Medford Happenings, a show for and about the city of Medford.

2
00:00:32,835 --> 00:00:34,435
I am John Petrella.

3
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:44,097
The purpose of this program is to give Medford citizens facts and information to help you make informed choices.

4
00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:50,559
Today, we have a very special guest, Trish Schiapelle.

5
00:00:51,573 --> 00:00:59,675
who will be speaking on things you really need to know about issues currently affecting Method.

6
00:01:01,295 --> 00:01:16,058
So we're gonna get right into the questions, and Trish, the first question is, tell us, what were the reasons you became involved with all the issues facing the city of Method?

7
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,290
Well, thank you for having me, John.

8
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:20,811
It's a pleasure to be here.

9
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:33,034
I think in May of 2024, I found some information from some neighbors that there was a methadone dispensary that was going to be going in on Salem Street.

10
00:01:33,714 --> 00:01:36,034
As an abutter, I had never been notified.

11
00:01:36,514 --> 00:01:43,336
And when I started talking to many of my neighbors and people in the neighborhood, they had not been notified either that

12
00:01:43,756 --> 00:01:45,877
this methadone dispensary was coming in.

13
00:01:46,537 --> 00:01:53,220
And so through looking at where they were going to place the methadone dispensary, it was .2 miles from an elementary school.

14
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,742
So I contacted the Attorney General's office and said, this is crazy.

15
00:01:58,122 --> 00:02:04,225
How can you let a methadone dispensary be .2 miles from an elementary school?

16
00:02:04,565 --> 00:02:10,628
You can't even put, and as he said to me, you can't even put a liquor store that close to an elementary school.

17
00:02:10,908 --> 00:02:12,268
I said, or a cannabis shop.

18
00:02:12,308 --> 00:02:13,189
He said, exactly.

19
00:02:13,749 --> 00:02:19,894
So, that's really what started and was the impetus to me gathering some neighbors together.

20
00:02:19,954 --> 00:02:21,035
What do you think of this?

21
00:02:21,295 --> 00:02:22,416
Are you concerned?

22
00:02:22,596 --> 00:02:23,737
What are we going to do about it?

23
00:02:25,818 --> 00:02:26,238
Okay.

24
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:28,360
Good answer.

25
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:36,506
So, the follow-up to that would be, I guess, why don't you think the city is doing the right things?

26
00:02:36,926 --> 00:02:38,728
Why wouldn't they want to do the right things?

27
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:46,622
Well, I think it's probably a couple of possibilities and maybe a combination, a little bit of everything.

28
00:02:46,642 --> 00:02:58,866
I think that the administration has their own agenda from the mayor all the way down to the city council members, the community development board, zoning, and just the list goes on.

29
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:02,747
None of them in particular seem to have

30
00:03:03,487 --> 00:03:09,515
significant business experience, which is really there's processes involved.

31
00:03:09,535 --> 00:03:12,018
You get experience with how things should be managed.

32
00:03:12,398 --> 00:03:17,925
And their experience really for the city council consists of someone with a theater major.

33
00:03:18,526 --> 00:03:25,835
someone that couldn't get elected in Somerville, so they moved to Medford, and then they were elected to the City Council.

34
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:32,503
You have someone on the City Council that has worked with some nonprofits and managed to bankrupt one of them.

35
00:03:32,523 --> 00:03:36,528
And you have a lot of career students.

36
00:03:37,028 --> 00:03:42,969
with very limited life experience and no business experience as it stands.

37
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:46,730
They think of the people of Medford are not paying attention.

38
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:52,012
And up until some of the recent things that have been happening throughout the city, that is probably very true.

39
00:03:52,472 --> 00:03:53,872
People became complacent.

40
00:03:54,332 --> 00:03:56,333
And look at the meetings.

41
00:03:56,933 --> 00:04:02,494
Our city council meetings are consumed with they all vote in a pack.

42
00:04:03,114 --> 00:04:06,655
They look at their historical trend of how they vote.

43
00:04:07,675 --> 00:04:11,916
There's only one outlier on the city council, and that's George Scarpelli.

44
00:04:12,376 --> 00:04:14,797
Other than that, you have six members.

45
00:04:15,217 --> 00:04:16,677
They all seem to vote alike.

46
00:04:16,797 --> 00:04:19,478
And you and I both know you can walk out there on the street.

47
00:04:19,498 --> 00:04:24,119
You're not going to get five people that agree on the color of the sky, what the temperature is.

48
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:27,260
And yet, sadly enough, they all vote together.

49
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,500
And they ran on a slate.

50
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:35,502
I think they agreed behind closed doors, from what I've heard, that they all vote in a pact.

51
00:04:35,662 --> 00:04:36,702
And so that's what they're doing.

52
00:04:37,222 --> 00:04:45,464
And unfortunately, what that causes is we have lost democracy on our city council.

53
00:04:45,864 --> 00:04:47,765
This is not the democratic way.

54
00:04:48,365 --> 00:04:50,606
You should be having discussions.

55
00:04:50,646 --> 00:04:57,508
You should be having three and four people against and for something and arguing and having in-depth conversations.

56
00:04:57,968 --> 00:04:59,188
And we just don't have it.

57
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:01,989
And one of the city councilors,

58
00:05:02,829 --> 00:05:07,992
just a few weeks ago, Collins said, we are elected to make decisions for you.

59
00:05:08,373 --> 00:05:10,014
No, that is not correct.

60
00:05:10,374 --> 00:05:20,140
You are elected to represent us and vote how we as constituents and taxpayers would want the vote to go.

61
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:23,482
You know, excellent answers.

62
00:05:23,982 --> 00:05:24,342
Really.

63
00:05:24,443 --> 00:05:26,944
I mean, that's like it was perfect.

64
00:05:27,144 --> 00:05:28,045
I mean, the truth.

65
00:05:29,055 --> 00:05:31,336
Love it, and thank you for that response.

66
00:05:31,496 --> 00:05:36,698
I think it's something people need to hear, that people need to understand.

67
00:05:37,258 --> 00:05:39,019
So thank you for that response.

68
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,420
Well spoken.

69
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:54,746
So now I want to get into what can be done to correct the problems Method is having, and what are your suggestions?

70
00:05:55,046 --> 00:05:57,827
What's some of the solutions maybe, or what are your suggestions?

71
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:12,294
So initially we went old school with standouts and this and that and the other thing and trying to go to the city council meetings and voice our opinions and it became very apparent that that isn't what they wanted to hear.

72
00:06:12,374 --> 00:06:15,537
So I think right now we are in the throes of

73
00:06:16,318 --> 00:06:17,058
legal action.

74
00:06:17,698 --> 00:06:25,941
I started reaching out to attorneys that I know to have conversations to start to figure out what are our legal options?

75
00:06:26,001 --> 00:06:27,461
Do we have legal options?

76
00:06:28,501 --> 00:06:33,303
And sadly, through the methadone experience, I quickly learned that they don't care what you think.

77
00:06:34,564 --> 00:06:41,631
And so, you know, people were completely blindsided with the fact that we were going to get a methadone dispensary.

78
00:06:42,471 --> 00:06:47,756
We gathered 550 signatures against the methadone dispensary.

79
00:06:48,037 --> 00:06:49,278
And that was gathered quickly.

80
00:06:49,478 --> 00:06:51,139
That was gathered quickly in weeks.

81
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:54,520
We were running behind the eight ball with everything on that one.

82
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,360
We were working weekends.

83
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:01,141
And then it came time to show up to the final city council meeting.

84
00:07:01,642 --> 00:07:07,823
And we sent out emails and all the people that had been at the standouts, which was very obvious.

85
00:07:07,883 --> 00:07:11,965
People were pulling their cars over going, where is this methadone dispensary going?

86
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:12,605
Right here.

87
00:07:13,045 --> 00:07:15,107
Well, there's a school 0.2 miles away.

88
00:07:15,367 --> 00:07:16,248
They couldn't believe it.

89
00:07:17,288 --> 00:07:18,589
How come we haven't heard of this?

90
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:23,653
We even had people on West Medford signing our petition.

91
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:27,016
And I said to one woman, I said, why are you signing our petition?

92
00:07:27,056 --> 00:07:28,457
This doesn't really affect you.

93
00:07:28,737 --> 00:07:30,038
She goes, it's Medford.

94
00:07:30,499 --> 00:07:31,600
We're all Medford.

95
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:36,143
It affects all of us, right, for the city and how we are perceived.

96
00:07:36,704 --> 00:07:36,904
And so

97
00:07:38,485 --> 00:07:40,928
Everyone showed up at that city council meeting.

98
00:07:41,148 --> 00:07:42,329
Everyone was ready to voice.

99
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:46,353
We had filled that gallery and we were shut down.

100
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:51,077
The city council president, Zach Baer, said we will not be taking public comment.

101
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:52,459
People were in outrage.

102
00:07:52,619 --> 00:07:55,262
I was worried somebody was going to go actually over the rails.

103
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,144
It was that bad.

104
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:03,126
And so George Scarpelli got a break, and they went in the back.

105
00:08:03,206 --> 00:08:08,508
And I think he said, you know, this is not going to be good for any of us if we don't let the people that came here to speak.

106
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:13,410
Sadly, the majority of people had already left because they were just so frustrated.

107
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:23,855
And I felt bad because I said, listen, if you really feel this strongly about the methadone dispensary in the neighborhood that close to a school, then please, show up.

108
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,722
Tell them, I can't be the only voice.

109
00:08:27,103 --> 00:08:28,848
Ten of us can't be the only voice.

110
00:08:31,663 --> 00:08:34,485
Anyway, you know, they were just outraged.

111
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:42,272
And George eventually got them to, who was left in the gallery, be able to come up and speak and things like that.

112
00:08:43,453 --> 00:08:50,238
And the reason I think people felt so strongly is that this Habit OpCo is really a company of bad actors.

113
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:53,701
They have a long, long list of complaints.

114
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:55,843
Every city that they have gone into.

115
00:08:56,843 --> 00:09:02,128
and every city that they manage from Lynn to Springfield, they're up in arms.

116
00:09:02,188 --> 00:09:07,173
And because they purchase the buildings, they really, they have, they're property owners.

117
00:09:07,273 --> 00:09:15,380
So there isn't anything that the city is going to do except ask them and they very vehemently say, you know, too bad we own the building.

118
00:09:16,501 --> 00:09:18,303
This same company recently,

119
00:09:18,663 --> 00:09:32,148
had an article written in the New York Times that there's a federal investigation going against them because they also own inpatient clinics for mental health and bipolar and things like that.

120
00:09:32,449 --> 00:09:40,912
And they were found, even the employees are testifying against them in the federal investigation and the federal lawsuit, that they hold people against their will.

121
00:09:41,172 --> 00:09:47,134
If you have the right kind of insurance, they're able to figure out that they're going to get paid, so they hold you against your will.

122
00:09:48,675 --> 00:09:58,983
I think that's really sad, and I think that fortunately we dodged a bullet by not letting that company into the parameters of our city.

123
00:09:59,543 --> 00:10:17,117
And one of the things that was so interesting in a lot of the research, our government, the Health and Human Services Division, went on to say and has done research around the methadone dispensaries, and there's a huge increase in human trafficking and

124
00:10:17,597 --> 00:10:27,786
things like that, and sex trafficking of children around those areas, which, you know, so close to an elementary school, it just makes me shudder to think that.

125
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:40,177
And it was then that I decided, after all of that, that really legal action was the only course that we could have where we were going to get the results that we needed immediately.

126
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:42,559
Sounds great.

127
00:10:44,892 --> 00:10:47,553
I agree with what you're saying, makes sense.

128
00:10:49,694 --> 00:11:05,920
I guess one of the things I think people listening would love to know about is, and I don't know how specific can you be, but can you be more specific on the legal actions being taken on behalf of the people in Method?

129
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:13,422
So legal actions, unfortunately, did not just end with the methadone dispensary.

130
00:11:13,502 --> 00:11:24,585
Legal action and having a legal guidance, if you will, and an attorney on retainer is something that we continue with to this day.

131
00:11:25,165 --> 00:11:36,968
We believe that is our only avenue currently with this administration to really push back around if there's large numbers of people that are seeing things that they don't want.

132
00:11:38,028 --> 00:11:48,816
And the reason we have to do that is, think about it, the mayor hasn't had a solicitor in this town for three years, I believe.

133
00:11:50,687 --> 00:11:55,052
It's because the people have no legal guidance.

134
00:11:55,212 --> 00:11:59,517
Typically, you would be able to go to the city solicitor and say, this is what's happening.

135
00:11:59,917 --> 00:12:00,578
What do you think?

136
00:12:00,938 --> 00:12:09,868
But because we don't have that, we have no guidance for the community and for independent people to ask questions and confirm.

137
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:26,709
She has then engaged a law firm that has allegiance to her because she's paying them, rightfully so, and now she can do whatever she wants, wherever she wants, and we are forced to live with it.

138
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,992
Basically, she has carte blanche.

139
00:12:30,173 --> 00:12:45,340
And she's banking on the fact, and I believe, my opinion, that we don't have the wherewithal and we don't have the financial capacity to hire a law firm, a good law firm, a big Boston law firm that will represent us.

140
00:12:47,881 --> 00:12:48,221
We do.

141
00:12:48,742 --> 00:12:49,262
And we have.

142
00:12:50,263 --> 00:12:57,688
And while we do have the same law firm that represented us with the methadone dispensary, we have a different attorney.

143
00:12:57,868 --> 00:13:13,078
And we did that intentionally because the attorney that we now have has a municipality expertise and specialty, which is, we feel, something that we really needed going forward with some of the things that are going on in Medford currently.

144
00:13:14,359 --> 00:13:16,101
And he's gone up against KP Law.

145
00:13:17,201 --> 00:13:24,005
Our newest fight, as I'm sure you're aware, is the Salem Street debacle that's going on.

146
00:13:25,286 --> 00:13:36,952
And so he was able to put together and pen a very nice but strong legal letter as to why this shouldn't be taking place on Salem Street.

147
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,821
Yeah, we know all about Salem Street.

148
00:13:40,841 --> 00:13:43,743
We did a previous show with Shelma Rodriguez.

149
00:13:43,903 --> 00:13:44,623
Oh, right, yes.

150
00:13:44,683 --> 00:13:47,665
She opened up everyone's eyes.

151
00:13:48,265 --> 00:13:49,626
Exactly, yes.

152
00:13:49,646 --> 00:13:51,907
She's really dug in and learned a lot about that.

153
00:13:51,927 --> 00:13:52,347
Yes, she has.

154
00:13:52,787 --> 00:13:55,329
A lot of facts and a lot of good information was put out.

155
00:13:56,329 --> 00:13:58,811
That was the last show we did, actually.

156
00:14:00,792 --> 00:14:02,733
So, you know, another question.

157
00:14:05,809 --> 00:14:12,863
How do you know, as far as the rezoning, how do you know there was a large number of people against it?

158
00:14:12,943 --> 00:14:16,109
What gets you to believe that?

159
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:19,451
Well, obviously, all of my neighbors are concerned.

160
00:14:19,991 --> 00:14:27,094
But then Sheryl Rodriguez, who we were just talking about, started a change.org petition online.

161
00:14:27,994 --> 00:14:42,059
And actually, as of last week, we had 980 verified signatures against the rezoning and against what the administration in this town wants to do.

162
00:14:42,439 --> 00:14:43,820
I think that's a strong number.

163
00:14:45,826 --> 00:14:51,569
There has, and it isn't, there just hasn't been any community outreach.

164
00:14:52,669 --> 00:15:12,017
And there was a meeting we were sitting in when they had just started talking about this and Kit Collins said, oh, if we could have knocked on every door in the Salem Street area, I would have wanted to talk to every neighbor and hear what they had to say and whether they were behind this.

165
00:15:12,117 --> 00:15:13,818
Well, you know,

166
00:15:14,871 --> 00:15:26,115
put that in an RFP then and have this Innis company, if they're the be all end all to community design and planning, they should be doing that.

167
00:15:26,215 --> 00:15:27,295
Put that in the RFP.

168
00:15:27,335 --> 00:15:35,398
That is your job to take care of the people in this area of your city and make sure that they are heard.

169
00:15:37,908 --> 00:15:45,233
The one thing that they're overlooking is that we are an environmental justice neighborhood.

170
00:15:45,493 --> 00:15:55,880
And that means, and this was put in the letter from our attorney at Richmond APC, and that is we are a racially diverse neighborhood.

171
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,222
We are an economically diverse neighborhood.

172
00:15:59,622 --> 00:16:02,104
We are a multilingual neighborhood.

173
00:16:02,624 --> 00:16:06,347
And no notice or community outreach has been done in English

174
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:11,310
let alone other languages for those that don't speak English.

175
00:16:12,151 --> 00:16:12,931
And that's not right.

176
00:16:13,892 --> 00:16:20,537
And this Salem Street rezoning has been in place since, I believe, July of last year.

177
00:16:21,217 --> 00:16:23,759
And the residents are just learning about it.

178
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:25,000
And I find that crazy.

179
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:33,826
And the first community engagement didn't happen until after they received our letter from the law firm.

180
00:16:34,507 --> 00:16:35,728
So that tells you

181
00:16:36,568 --> 00:16:41,410
that all of the people that raised concerns, many people say, oh, we brought it up.

182
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:42,451
We wrote a letter.

183
00:16:42,811 --> 00:16:44,692
We called the Community Development Board.

184
00:16:45,152 --> 00:16:55,196
No action was going to be done until they got that our environmentally justice neighborhood is unhappy and the people need to be represented.

185
00:16:55,836 --> 00:16:58,738
So I think at the end of the day, we can all agree

186
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:01,280
Salem needs a little facelift.

187
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,622
It needs some love, right?

188
00:17:03,924 --> 00:17:08,951
But they have not followed processes set forth in their own procedures.

189
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,840
They haven't done that.

190
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:28,068
Therefore, by law, if you haven't notified abutters and if you haven't had community engagement, and it's not just one community engagement, one time at the elementary school, six months, seven months after you've already started the process, no.

191
00:17:28,588 --> 00:17:36,332
They have to go all the way back and start over from the beginning, and that is what we intend to make them do.

192
00:17:37,572 --> 00:17:43,555
There have been no traffic studies, no studies on the effect to the school enrollments.

193
00:17:43,655 --> 00:17:45,236
How is that going to affect it?

194
00:17:46,037 --> 00:17:51,800
No studies for safety, just our own safety in the neighborhood around fire and police.

195
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:57,483
They're saying you can go four to six stories high and with eight foot between the buildings.

196
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,103
Now, does that make common sense?

197
00:18:00,223 --> 00:18:01,325
Our streets are old.

198
00:18:01,385 --> 00:18:02,827
We are an older neighborhood.

199
00:18:03,367 --> 00:18:04,148
Very narrow.

200
00:18:04,329 --> 00:18:11,318
Sometimes if, on my street, if you have two cars parked on either side, the fire truck really has to finagle.

201
00:18:11,499 --> 00:18:14,162
And I'm like, I hope that guy's a good driver.

202
00:18:15,103 --> 00:18:16,905
Difficult time getting down to Longstreet.

203
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:17,805
Exactly.

204
00:18:17,825 --> 00:18:23,829
And there are just so many other problems around Salem Street area.

205
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:34,637
We are fortunate enough to have a trained engineer working with us, and we found out many, many things that need to take place.

206
00:18:36,098 --> 00:18:42,766
are not, and so we are bringing those all up together, and there will probably be another legal letter.

207
00:18:43,326 --> 00:18:52,836
But ultimately, we are interviewing attorneys for a class-action lawsuit regarding the Salem Street lack of process as defined by the law.

208
00:18:52,996 --> 00:18:57,782
It constitutes, from a couple of attorneys, a taking of land, if you will.

209
00:18:59,042 --> 00:19:03,484
And ultimately, above all other items, there's discrimination, right?

210
00:19:03,524 --> 00:19:05,965
We are an environmental justice neighborhood.

211
00:19:06,325 --> 00:19:07,425
We have certain rights.

212
00:19:07,525 --> 00:19:09,546
This isn't taking place in West Medford.

213
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:10,506
Why is that, right?

214
00:19:10,546 --> 00:19:11,927
Why is nothing like this taking?

215
00:19:12,887 --> 00:19:19,509
So that is discrimination, and we intend, you know, to see where that can go, so.

216
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:22,090
Very good answer.

217
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:24,551
I mean, all good stuff.

218
00:19:25,131 --> 00:19:26,672
Facts, once again.

219
00:19:29,522 --> 00:19:40,369
You know, the past few days, I keep hearing about, I'm reading about, it just seems like everything is moving so fast.

220
00:19:41,509 --> 00:19:46,072
You talk about the processes and what should be done, what needs to be done.

221
00:19:46,493 --> 00:19:55,058
Well, now I'm hearing about Wellington area, I'm hearing about South Medford, I mean, you know,

222
00:19:56,228 --> 00:20:00,794
It just seems like everything is going on and it's all going on fast.

223
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:04,479
And I mean, what do you know about any of these other projects?

224
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:08,805
Because it just seems like it's all happening.

225
00:20:10,018 --> 00:20:11,159
Yeah, yeah.

226
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:18,745
So that's really a loaded question, because there is so much going on.

227
00:20:18,805 --> 00:20:22,448
We could be here just for its own show, just on that, what's going on.

228
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:30,935
But I do know that there is a 10-story dorm going in with Tufts in South Medford.

229
00:20:32,176 --> 00:20:34,857
The neighbors were very upset about that, and rightfully so.

230
00:20:34,897 --> 00:20:38,838
There's going to be 670-some people in that dorm.

231
00:20:38,858 --> 00:20:48,260
And as one of the neighbors said, I don't want 670 people staring at me when I'm in my backyard on a Saturday or Sunday morning.

232
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,920
And that's not even the biggest part of it.

233
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,701
The biggest part of it is they're losing sunlight.

234
00:20:53,741 --> 00:20:56,021
We already in New England don't have a lot of sunlight.

235
00:20:56,402 --> 00:20:57,482
There's sunlight studies.

236
00:20:58,722 --> 00:21:00,865
seem questionable at best, if you will.

237
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:04,830
And, you know, so that's an issue.

238
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:09,195
In fact, they are using our same attorney at Richmond.

239
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:12,339
Those people in that neighborhood have banned together.

240
00:21:12,819 --> 00:21:13,660
Mystic Avenue is

241
00:21:15,202 --> 00:21:22,170
In the process of being rezoned, I hear 20 stories on the side that's near the water, which is crazy.

242
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:34,965
You know, they want to put in all of this communal living and all of these dorms and all of this, and it's not really the neighborhood environment that people and that the homeowners, the taxpayers and the voters want to live in.

243
00:21:36,327 --> 00:21:36,867
There's St.

244
00:21:36,948 --> 00:21:40,451
Clair going up where we don't even know really what's going in there.

245
00:21:40,512 --> 00:21:53,086
It's supposed to be, it was originally supposed to be a domestic violence shelter then, but they referred to it in their business plan as recidivism, so recidivism and domestic violence.

246
00:21:54,670 --> 00:22:00,295
domestic violence victims shouldn't really be used in the same sentence, in my opinion.

247
00:22:00,415 --> 00:22:02,437
So there's a lot going on there.

248
00:22:02,517 --> 00:22:07,341
But again, all of these projects are going on all at the same time.

249
00:22:07,481 --> 00:22:17,950
And this, again, speaks to my point where the city lacks the experience and this administration lacks the experience because there isn't a business out there unless they are

250
00:22:19,098 --> 00:22:29,083
a staunch, sophisticated business that has done this for years and learned their lessons and made their mistakes and learned that would do this many projects at once.

251
00:22:29,263 --> 00:22:43,549
And so I would say, let's pick one project, do that one project, do it well, experience it, learn from a few mistakes, and then move on to the second project, not six projects.

252
00:22:43,769 --> 00:22:44,290
I hear you.

253
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:44,710
Do it.

254
00:22:45,508 --> 00:22:47,490
you know, one thing at a time, do it right.

255
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:48,190
Correct.

256
00:22:49,672 --> 00:22:53,135
And go on from there, you know, learn from your mistakes, as you say.

257
00:22:53,615 --> 00:22:55,817
And we all know there's going to be mistakes made.

258
00:22:56,178 --> 00:23:05,526
And I, you know, honestly, I don't think anyone doesn't want to see some kind of development, especially the Mystic Ave area.

259
00:23:06,327 --> 00:23:09,710
I mean, what's down there now and down in the Wellington area?

260
00:23:12,019 --> 00:23:16,482
You know, I call it the parkway, whatever, but it's just nothing there anymore.

261
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:24,669
I mean, so it could use some updating, some development, but it's gotta be the right kind.

262
00:23:25,449 --> 00:23:27,951
And I think that's basically what we're asking for.

263
00:23:28,471 --> 00:23:34,056
And instead of just rushing in and, I mean, that's what it seems like to me.

264
00:23:35,757 --> 00:23:36,778
You know, the other thing is,

265
00:23:38,392 --> 00:24:02,648
You know, I look around the city, I drive around the city, I'm all over the city, and I ask myself, and I'll ask you, what is this administration, the people currently running this city, I include the council, the school committee, the mayor, I mean, what do you see being done in the last, I don't know, six, seven, eight years?

266
00:24:02,668 --> 00:24:05,890
I mean, what's going on, what are they doing?

267
00:24:08,509 --> 00:24:14,935
Well, I think that's the driving force behind all of these projects taking place.

268
00:24:15,135 --> 00:24:17,857
I think that that's a great question.

269
00:24:18,277 --> 00:24:25,223
And I think most people living in Medford would say, when you look around and you drive around, not much, not a lot.

270
00:24:26,044 --> 00:24:34,869
And it's as if the administration has had this epiphany that, oh my gosh, we've been in office X amount of years, and we haven't really done.

271
00:24:35,749 --> 00:24:37,450
People are still complaining about the streets.

272
00:24:37,831 --> 00:24:39,151
There's still lead in the water.

273
00:24:39,231 --> 00:24:41,012
There's still problems at the school.

274
00:24:41,253 --> 00:24:47,456
And so they're trying now to overcompensate for that because there's another election coming up.

275
00:24:49,377 --> 00:24:54,420
You know, the roads are awful and the schools are not being run efficiently, to your point, and the list just goes on.

276
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,902
There's still no city solicitor, right?

277
00:24:58,062 --> 00:24:59,943
Why can't that be fixed in three years?

278
00:25:00,463 --> 00:25:02,704
And there's nothing but lawsuits.

279
00:25:03,185 --> 00:25:04,345
Nothing but lawsuits.

280
00:25:04,445 --> 00:25:06,887
And as someone that's, you know,

281
00:25:07,667 --> 00:25:09,567
run a business and run profit centers.

282
00:25:10,388 --> 00:25:15,909
If you're getting sued that often, someone should be figuring out why.

283
00:25:16,009 --> 00:25:17,589
You need to be having conversations.

284
00:25:17,909 --> 00:25:19,589
Who's getting all of the lawsuits?

285
00:25:20,029 --> 00:25:21,570
Is it one specific department?

286
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:24,190
Is it one specific manager?

287
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:25,690
Is it a group?

288
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:27,531
Where is it coming from?

289
00:25:27,551 --> 00:25:30,211
And what is the impetus to that?

290
00:25:30,551 --> 00:25:31,812
And how do we stop it?

291
00:25:31,912 --> 00:25:33,472
How do we quell that from happening?

292
00:25:33,932 --> 00:25:39,134
But, you know, what they have accomplished is they've increased taxes.

293
00:25:39,695 --> 00:25:42,316
They've offered to give themselves salary increases.

294
00:25:43,516 --> 00:25:47,838
There's complete chaos in every single neighborhood except West Medford.

295
00:25:48,018 --> 00:25:49,299
Isn't that interesting?

296
00:25:50,099 --> 00:25:53,801
And I just think that there's

297
00:25:54,621 --> 00:26:06,303
a lot of reasons for many homeowners, taxpayers, voters, and citizens to have concern, a lot of concern.

298
00:26:07,908 --> 00:26:09,609
And I think people do, I really do.

299
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:14,473
I think people... They're starting to... And you know, that's the good thing, right?

300
00:26:14,933 --> 00:26:18,996
We were all very sleepy and I used to say, oh, ignorance was blessed.

301
00:26:19,176 --> 00:26:22,399
When I didn't know any of this stuff was going on, it was great.

302
00:26:22,719 --> 00:26:25,781
Now my whole life is consumed with it when I'm not at work.

303
00:26:27,422 --> 00:26:42,014
So, I think, and this is the benefit, they have woken up tens of thousands of people, taxpayers and voters, that are really ticked off and fed up.

304
00:26:42,814 --> 00:26:44,656
I hear it day in and day out.

305
00:26:44,856 --> 00:26:46,437
As do I. I agree with that.

306
00:26:46,678 --> 00:26:47,338
I really do.

307
00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:50,801
You know, you look to the future of method.

308
00:26:52,002 --> 00:26:52,963
I mean, what do you perceive?

309
00:26:53,143 --> 00:26:55,445
What do you think is going to go on?

310
00:26:56,165 --> 00:26:59,488
What do we need to do moving forward?

311
00:26:59,748 --> 00:27:00,569
I love Medford.

312
00:27:01,049 --> 00:27:04,412
I bought my home here in 2013, and I've lived here.

313
00:27:04,432 --> 00:27:07,535
I love being in a diverse neighborhood.

314
00:27:07,555 --> 00:27:13,299
I love its location to Cambridge, and you can be in and out of Boston very quickly.

315
00:27:14,881 --> 00:27:20,746
But it's not going to get better in Medford and keep the neighborhood feel until

316
00:27:22,547 --> 00:27:24,809
there's a change at the next election.

317
00:27:24,829 --> 00:27:26,891
I mean, that has to happen.

318
00:27:27,511 --> 00:27:36,158
And there are certain things that we need desperately to happen that this administration just will not allow.

319
00:27:36,838 --> 00:27:38,480
And one of the things is an audit, right?

320
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:39,801
And we had asked

321
00:27:40,321 --> 00:27:41,522
Can we have an audit?

322
00:27:41,603 --> 00:27:42,744
Can we vote on that?

323
00:27:43,004 --> 00:27:45,948
And unfortunately, it's Massachusetts state law.

324
00:27:45,968 --> 00:27:59,063
It's the only state in the country that in order for a municipality to pull an audit, you need to have all 100% vote by the city council and the mayor has to agree to it.

325
00:27:59,904 --> 00:28:03,825
So, and it isn't that there's any necessarily wrongdoing.

326
00:28:04,325 --> 00:28:14,269
It's just that what we see even in business is dealing with the same vendors, if you will, which is what an audit firm is, they get a little complacent.

327
00:28:15,389 --> 00:28:17,230
and don't look as hard as they should.

328
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:19,992
And then what can we ask for from them, right?

329
00:28:20,012 --> 00:28:21,193
We don't get line items.

330
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:22,594
We should have line items.

331
00:28:23,274 --> 00:28:31,660
Was that department, so without having line items for departments with specific expenses, you have the ability to move funds around.

332
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:41,267
Not that there's anything necessarily wrong with that, as long as at the end of the day your dollars and cents balance out and you know technically where everything is.

333
00:28:41,867 --> 00:28:47,993
But the perfect example of not having a line item is they left $9 million in a checking account for a year.

334
00:28:48,013 --> 00:28:50,195
And they said, oops, we found a checking account.

335
00:28:50,636 --> 00:28:59,464
How do you leave $9 million in a checking account in an interest rate environment that hasn't existed in decades?

336
00:29:00,145 --> 00:29:00,365
Correct.

337
00:29:00,726 --> 00:29:02,708
And so $9 million at a 5% interest rate

338
00:29:06,109 --> 00:29:10,014
100% collateralized, because you would never take a risk with public funds, right?

339
00:29:10,655 --> 00:29:16,824
Lost us $450,000 in one year, and if it had been there for two years, well, let's do the math, right?

340
00:29:16,864 --> 00:29:18,407
That's a lot of money.

341
00:29:18,707 --> 00:29:19,669
But again,

342
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:23,252
You don't know that because you don't have line items, right?

343
00:29:23,292 --> 00:29:30,077
When you have line items, you know every single penny, where it is, and you list all of the financial institutions.

344
00:29:30,197 --> 00:29:33,220
And we need to have an ethics committee.

345
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,762
I feel really very, very strong.

346
00:29:35,822 --> 00:29:37,663
The state has an ethics committee.

347
00:29:38,064 --> 00:29:42,067
We can model it after what the state does for an ethics committee.

348
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:55,297
and set the rules of the road that everyone has to adhere to, whether you're a developer in the city, whether you're a business owner, whether you're a taxpayer, whether you're a city councilor, whether you're the mayor.

349
00:29:56,398 --> 00:30:01,342
Let's say here's the line in the sand, and this is where we don't go over it.

350
00:30:01,823 --> 00:30:05,345
And it has to happen.

351
00:30:05,365 --> 00:30:06,566
It just has to happen.

352
00:30:07,511 --> 00:30:17,276
And if not, my concern and my fear is that this administration is on the way to bankrupting the city of Medford.

353
00:30:18,757 --> 00:30:20,518
That's my greatest fear.

354
00:30:20,658 --> 00:30:24,260
Not good hearing that, but... Just the lawsuits alone.

355
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,821
I mean, how many lawsuits can you take?

356
00:30:27,081 --> 00:30:29,763
Especially if we start a class action and especially if we do.

357
00:30:30,083 --> 00:30:30,823
I mean, you have 947, 980 people in

358
00:30:35,703 --> 00:30:38,426
And a class action lawsuit, that's going to be expensive.

359
00:30:38,446 --> 00:30:40,728
I know there's a lot of lawsuits against the city right now.

360
00:30:41,829 --> 00:30:43,731
Unfortunately, unfortunately.

361
00:30:44,892 --> 00:30:46,014
And a lot of them shouldn't be.

362
00:30:46,494 --> 00:30:52,140
And I definitely, I agree with you on the audit, I mean the line items, that is like

363
00:30:53,425 --> 00:30:58,427
so important, and we all know the council voted no, except for George Scarbelli.

364
00:30:58,627 --> 00:31:00,127
Right, right, right.

365
00:31:00,267 --> 00:31:01,308
They didn't want to spend the money.

366
00:31:01,608 --> 00:31:04,429
They don't want to spend the money on that, but they'll spend the money on the lawsuits.

367
00:31:04,469 --> 00:31:11,811
They don't want to spend the money on hiring the right planning company that's going to do an RFP that's going to include going out.

368
00:31:13,732 --> 00:31:17,653
their comment to us when we said, well, you haven't even done traffic studies on Salem Street.

369
00:31:17,733 --> 00:31:22,434
Their comment to us is, well, when the businesses come in, they'll do their traffic study.

370
00:31:22,474 --> 00:31:33,697
When what they want to build comes into play, why do we have to do 10 different traffic studies that we, you know, we do one traffic study, then you know where you go, right?

371
00:31:35,377 --> 00:31:36,778
And they do it a little bit backwards.

372
00:31:36,818 --> 00:31:39,939
It's almost like you need to run the city with a business plan.

373
00:31:40,339 --> 00:31:43,920
What do we need for money and where are we going to get it?

374
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:56,885
And how are we going to divide that money up that we want to get between the homeowners and the taxpayers and the businesses and the new businesses coming in and how can we attract people here that are going to help that?

375
00:31:58,019 --> 00:32:00,260
Yeah, no, you know, great answers.

376
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,821
And I see, I guess I'm being told we're coming to the end of the show.

377
00:32:04,841 --> 00:32:05,061
Okay.

378
00:32:05,642 --> 00:32:07,062
I want to thank you so much.

379
00:32:07,182 --> 00:32:10,863
I mean, this was a great show, very informative.

380
00:32:11,904 --> 00:32:22,367
You obviously know your stuff, and I appreciate candid answers and honesty, and wonderful.

381
00:32:22,487 --> 00:32:23,928
Great job, Tricia, thank you.

382
00:32:24,008 --> 00:32:24,788
Thank you again for having me.

00:32:24,808 --> 00:32:25,568
Gonna have you back.

384
00:32:25,608 --> 00:32:26,669
We gotta have you back.

385
