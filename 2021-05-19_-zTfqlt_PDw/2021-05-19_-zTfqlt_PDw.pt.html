 Boa noite, prefeito Lungo-Koehn e membros do comitê escolar.
 Esta noite é a nossa quinta reunião para discutir o orçamento.
 Esta tarde vamos nos concentrar no escritório central.
 Novamente, o escritório do superintendente, operações, finanças, segurança,
 participação familiar, recursos humanos e edifícios e terrenos.
 Então, sem mais delongas, passarei o bastão para o Sr. Murphy.
 E só quero agradecer a ele novamente, à sua equipe e a Michelle Kingdon por todo o trabalho que estão realizando durante o processo orçamentário.
 Obrigado, Sr.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=208.272s">[David Murphy]</a>:  Thank you, Superintendent, Mayor, members of the school committee.
 It's a pleasure to be with you again this evening.
 for our fifth committee of the whole meeting focused on the FY22 budget.
 As the superintendent mentioned, tonight we'll be focused on elements of the central office, specifically the offices that are under both the superintendent and my own supervision.
 As we go through the beginning of the program, as we have each time, we'll be looking at the org chart and talking specifically about the offices whose budgets are
 are here in light of the fact that these are the offices that myself and the superintendent work most closely with.
 While Dr. Kuching, Ms.
 Galussi, Ms.
 Bowen are here, with the exception of Director McLaughlin, we will be really the only presenters and speakers tonight.
 But certainly we'll be eager to answer any questions that you have, both with respect to the offices that we are focusing on tonight and anything else that we've covered
 over the course of the last several weeks.
 And as I mentioned in my message to the committee, both last night and a few minutes ago, we will be having a budget update on the school committee agenda this coming Monday, May 24th.
 And we'll certainly be picking up questions and comments at that point, incorporating and taking in your feedback.
 And that will go into the development of the recommendations that come before you.
 prior to your June 1st statutory hearing.
 So with that, I will start, as we always do, with the timeline for our budget process, beginning with the development of the district's strategic goals and priorities, leading to a series of, some administrators might say, seemingly endless administrative meetings internally, in which we vet various proposals and comments, questions, and suggestions
 principles and evening, but have not been following along for each of the various budget presentations, both at regular school committee meetings, budget subcommittee and the committee of the whole meetings.
 This is where we are right now leading up to that June 1st public hearing in which members of the community will be invited to speak either for or against, or a favorite for those who follow municipal presentations, those wishing to speak neither for nor against.
 the budget in part or in whole.
 And again, that will take place on June 1st, but there will be a budget update on Monday, an opportunity to comment and engage in further discussion.
 We've used the org chart in each of these presentations, just as by way of showing folks, perhaps outside of the Medford Public Schools community,
 which area of the organization we're focused on in this particular meeting.
 So this is the overall org chart showing all the various offices and departments reporting up to the superintendent.
 And then these are the areas that we'll be discussing tonight.
 So you can see it's primarily the areas in my own portfolio, as well as those reporting directly to the superintendent.
 And you see the curvy arrow there on the right of the screen.
 which is indicating a reorganization of sorts that we'll be proposing as part of the FY22 budget, and that's something I'll be going into greater detail about shortly.
 So as we've discussed in each of the budget presentations, the funding for the Metro Public Schools and the funding generally for school districts across Massachusetts comes from various sources.
 What we often refer to as the Chapter 70 allocation, which is the
 The state contribution under state law coming out of ed reform law of 1993 and the funding that each school community and district are entitled to.
 The local contribution, which is the revenue generated from at the local level that is air marked for the for the school department, which in Medford is a very sizable portion of that of the overall
 operating budget.
 And then the sort of extenuating circumstances under which we're currently operating mean we have a significant influx of federal funding coming in as a result of the COVID-related legislation that has come in.
 And that is coupled with the sort of standing external funds that come in on a year-in and year-out basis, particularly in the area of special education, which we discussed at length at the May 6th Committee of the Whole when we heard from the Office of Pupil Services.
 We've said that throughout the FY22 budget, we've asked those contributing to the development of this budget, meaning our department heads and our principals, to focus essentially on three primary buckets of areas in which we're asking them what are their budgetary priorities, what are their needs, what are their challenges.
 First is personnel and staffing.
 And the committee certainly said before that when we're talking about school budgets, we're almost always talking about people.
 We're an organization made up of people, educating people, hoping to make them better people and people who are positioned to do well in their post-secondary lives.
 But that is always going to be the largest chunk of our budget because, you know, as we say sometimes in school finance, we're not focused on widgets.
 We're focused on people in a community, and that's always going to be the largest chunk.
 Materials and infrastructure, particularly under the challenging conditions under which we're operating, are always going to represent
 another, albeit smaller, aspect of the budget.
 And training and professional development, which everything is, we are looking at everything through a post-COVID context, but for training and professional development, when we think about the ways in which some of the inequities, both within public education and society at large, have come into sharper relief as a result of the experience that we've all lived through, we are thinking very much in that context when we talk about
 what are our professional development and training priorities, and what is it that we're looking to invest in.
 And particularly when we're talking about the superintendent's priorities, while much of what we're planning will be supported by external funding, given that the budget development process is the opportunity to really look at the organization as a whole, see how we're structured, how we're organized, what it is that we're pursuing, what are our discrete challenges, what are our long-term overarching challenges,
 This really is an opportunity to sort of pull the veil back on all of the Medford Public Schools.
 And my hope would be that throughout these committee of the whole presentations, as we've heard from the various directors and school leaders, my hope would be that both for the school committee and the members of the community who are either watching this in real time or perhaps watching it subsequent to the presentations, you'll see the effort toward transparency that we have employed to try to demonstrate for the community exactly what it is that we're doing.
 And I hope also
 the rationale behind these priorities.
 And this slide talks a little bit about that rationale in that these are the questions that were posed that led to the development of these priorities and that we're thinking about what are the targeted and intensive interventions that we can invest in to help reduce or eliminate the learning or opportunity gaps that have either been caused by or exacerbated by the disruption to instruction that our students have faced as a result of
 the COVID-19 pandemic.
 And so there will come a time when our budgetary priorities and our goals are not informed fully by this experience and the disruption that our students have lived through.
 At least I certainly hope that's the case.
 One of the sort of constant refrains that we go back to is we're looking to make investments that will ensure our students' academic careers are not defined by this experience.
 And hopefully if we make these investments and we execute on them wisely, that will be the case.
 But for right now,
 coming out of these, as cliche as it might sound, these unprecedented circumstances, we are looking to see how do we use the funding that's available to us from the local, state, and federal levels to try to put them in the best position possible despite the chaos that we've all lived through.
 So on April 26th, we presented to the school committee the projections that we were looking at based on the preliminary information that we had.
 uh, leading into these budget presentations.
 And we've estimated that, uh, the necessary increase in the budget would be somewhere between 3.4 and $5.8 million.
 Recognizing that there are a significant number of variables that are, uh, essentially not clear while variable one, there are restrictions on federal funding flowing in that are still not particularly clear.
 And I appreciate the mayor's comments to that effect.
 last night, but we're continuing to engage in a very constructive dialogue with our partners in the city government and reaching out to our partners at the state level and elsewhere to try to get clarity on that.
 I think at this point we feel comfortable that the priorities we've developed that we think of as having a strong nexus to the disruption caused by COVID will be essentially eligible expenses.
 It's a question of, from an administrative perspective, exactly how
 we'll go about processing those and exactly how realistic is it to do that.
 So I think we feel good about the priorities that we've identified as our COVID-related or potential ESSER-related priorities, but there's still a lot of clarity that needs to come into view in the coming weeks.
 In addition to that, we know we have fixed costs as every district does on a year-on-year basis.
 These are costs that are related to contractual obligations or
 other situations that have essentially predated the development of this budget, but we know that they're going to lead to an increase in costs.
 Other variables also include the fact that we have upwards of nine collective bargaining agreements that are expiring either at the conclusion of this school year or the conclusion of the summer.
 And so that's certainly a factor that we have to take into account as we work through the development of this budget.
 This is just information related to those external funding, the numbers the committee has seen several times before, so I won't
 belabor it, but we estimate about a $7.6 million ESSER budget over the next several years.
 And so I wouldn't say that we necessarily see that as needing to be expended in equal installments over the three or four year period that we have.
 But I would say that we want to be mindful of the fact that we're going to have additional data that will hopefully point us to more strategic uses of the funding as time goes on.
 So it may be the case that some of the more immediate expenses are in the short term, but the better use of the funding could be in year two or year three.
 And for that reason, we are looking to be, I'm not sure I would use the word conservative, but certainly cautious and cognizant of the implications of using that funding.
 And the fact is, as you've heard me say several times, these are one-time funds and the ESSER funding will not last forever.
 And so we have to be mindful of the uses
 being taking care to not create unnecessary structural deficits, and at the same time, making sure that we're being responsive to the urgent needs of students.
 And so where we strike that equilibrium is a big part of the conversations that we have been having and that we will be having.
 So I'm going to pause for one second before we move on to buildings and grounds and just talk a little bit about what you'll see over the next couple of slides in this, but I'm glad that I flashed to it quickly so that I can tell
 Mr. McLaughlin that he's on next as I continue to babble for another minute or so.
 But the departments that you're seeing starting with buildings, we're going to start with buildings and grounds and then move to the more umbrella offices of the superintendent's office and the office of finance and operations.
 And if you think back to the organizational chart that we saw at the beginning of the presentation, you can see that for both myself and Dr. Edouard-Vincent, there are a lot of priorities and funding and strategic investments
 and proposals that cut across the different departments and offices that you've already heard from.
 And that's a good thing because what we don't want to do is present a budget to you in the form of 25 siloed or overly departmentalized mini organizations.
 We want common themes and common strategic priorities that cut across.
 And so what you'll see in the bullets that we've identified are pieces that are either reflective of those priorities
 or operational pieces that are meant to put us in a position that we'll be able to actually pursue those priorities and do so successfully.
 Similar to the information technology budget proposals that we discussed in last night's committee of the whole, a large portion, arguably all, frankly, of the buildings and grounds priorities, the year maintenance issue,
 uh, that is essentially routine.
 I think routine was the word that we used in the technology presentation.
 That's something that we typically are going to incorporate one way or another into our operating budget.
 Um, something that is a one-time expense and I'm using the term one time in the context of municipal budgeting.
 And so one time could mean every 10 years, every 15 years, every 20 years, but certainly not on an annual basis.
 Um, that's every 20 years, but certainly not on an annual basis.
 That's something that we're going to look up to as a capital expense that we're going to try to keep off the operating budget for purposes of not creating some of those deficits that we've talked about.
 What we do when we have a large influx of federal funding, frankly, similar to how we handled the funding that came in during FY21, and to some extent in FY20 as well, is to try to address some of the most urgent priorities and needs that might in another context be considered a capital expense.
 but in light of the urgency, we're looking to just take what funding is available and make sure that that's addressed.
 That was certainly the case as is reflected in the buildings and grounds budget narrative that was provided to you today with regard to our HVAC repairs that we needed to expedite and accelerate at the beginning of this school year for purposes of getting students and staff back into the physical school buildings.
 And so I expressed my appreciation for Mr. McLaughlin and members of his team who partnered with
 the external experts that we brought in to make that a reality.
 The history as to how we got to the place where so much work was necessary, I think, has been addressed at length in previous meetings.
 But however we got here, we are in a much better position from an air quality perspective because that work was done throughout the course of this year.
 And now we're looking at some of the other heavy infrastructure pieces that may not land in the operating budget for FY22.
 but are critical priorities that need to be addressed in the near term.
 And I'm going to ask Mr. McLaughlin, if he could, to walk us through some of these.
 As we're talking about how these investments need to be made in the coming year or months.
 So John, do you want to take it from there and just start maybe with the generator and transformer electrical issues that we have
 been identified at the high school and at the Andrews and then we'll walk through some of the other pieces.
 From there we'll move on to finance operations in the superintendent's office and then we'll go to questions after that.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=1158.093s">[John McLaughlin]</a>: Excelente.
 Boa noite prefeito, superintendente, membros da comissão escolar e administradores.
 na reunião desta noite.
 Portanto, o primeiro problema, a falha dos amplificadores transformadores, são os projetos elétricos da Medford High School e da Andrews Middle School.
 Portanto, penso que estamos conscientes do facto de que o gerador de emergência
 Um dos geradores de emergência da Medford High School precisa ser substituído.
 Nós discutimos isso.
 Estamos no caminho certo para obter uma RFP e informações de preços para tentar obter esse projeto. Alguém mais deixou o áudio?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=1195.2s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: Não?

 Acho que estamos bem, John.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=1214.44s">[John McLaughlin]</a>: Bem, bem.
 Então, na Andrews School, essa questão já foi eliminada do meu orçamento regular.
 Fizemos varreduras elétricas infravermelhas em todos os edifícios e houve um problema com um disjuntor no Andrews que temos.
 reparado, isso é bom.
 Também temos um transformador.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=1236.901s">[Kathy Kreatz]</a>: Não consigo ouvir o Sr. McLaughlin.</p>

 Você quer que eu comece de novo, Melanie?

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=1256.274s">[Kathy Kreatz]</a>: Kathy, você consegue ouvir agora?

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=1262.233s">[John McLaughlin]</a>: Bem.
 Não sei.
 Já tenho o ponto de acesso ativo.
 Eu, eu, você sabe, estou me preparando para isso há algum tempo.
 De qualquer forma, então, uh, sim, então o, uh, o disjuntor ou o amplificador, uh, trans, uh, o disjuntor foi substituído na Andrews High School.
 Então estamos de volta onde precisamos estar.
 Hum, fazia parte de, uh, tínhamos, hum, seguro, uh, inspeção, varredura infravermelha de todos os sistemas elétricos.
 no ensino médio, até a faculdade de direito, com licença.
 E assim conseguimos cuidar disso com meu orçamento operacional normal.
 Então a gente sabe, a gente também sabe do gerador de emergência, que está se preparando para sair para uma RFP.
 Além disso, o transformador é um equipamento original da Medford High School.
 Então o que aconteceu foi, é quando,
 anos atrás eu teria PCBs.
 Então tivemos que remover os PCBs e colocar outro tipo de óleo neles.
 E o que acaba acontecendo é que as vedações de borracha tendem a ceder.
 Então estou no processo de fazer uma cotação.
 Eu tenho, acabei de recebê-lo hoje para verificar o transformador.
 E certifique-se de que podemos voltar para onde precisamos estar.
 Está com pouco óleo, ainda está funcionando, mas certamente é algo que deve ter prioridade porque também está executando cerca de um terço da energia.
 na Medford High School.
 Então teremos as informações de preços prontas para prosseguir com isso.
 E isso seria um projeto de verão, obviamente, com o gerador, desde que estejamos prontos para assumir esse projeto.
 Este ano, tivemos algumas melhorias de segurança.
 Tínhamos um novo sistema Raptor.
 Instalei todos os monitores nessa época, recebi treinamento no novo sistema Raptor.
 Se você não sabe que o sistema Raptor é onde você entra, você se dá uma licença e eles a escaneiam.
 Se tudo estiver certo, você receberá uma etiqueta e estará pronto para ir ao escritório central para fazer os negócios que precisa em qualquer uma de nossas escolas.
 Então, a cada três ou quatro anos gostamos de terminar o estacionamento.
 Geralmente são todos eles, devo dizer, em todo o sistema.
 Os estacionamentos estão demarcados novamente, estão começando a envelhecer.
 Queríamos fazer alguns
 ajustes na Mefford High School, com os quais nos encontraremos sobre a situação de estacionamento para deficientes.
 Eu sei que tivemos essa conversa quando falávamos sobre a entrada principal.
 E acho que o que queremos fazer é mudar para os locais para deficientes físicos na parte frontal da Mefford High School e acessar a rampa para deficientes ali mesmo.
 Então isso seria, você sabe, vamos revisá-lo.
 falei com
 Prefeito Lungo-Koehn na semana passada, então se eu precisar de ajuda, temos o departamento de trânsito na Prefeitura, eles ficarão mais do que felizes em nos ajudar.
 Reunimo-nos com eles há alguns anos para tentar fazer algumas melhorias, mas como todos sabemos, o ano que passou não foi o ano típico com que normalmente lidamos.
 O Projeto da Caldeira Curtis Tufts, então no inverno passado, a caldeira começou a vazar.
 Estas são todas as coisas que provavelmente iremos abordar na próxima semana na reunião do subcomité.
 Por isso encomendamos algumas peças que precisam ser reinstaladas, ou seja, seccionais.
 Assim conseguimos dois seccionais que eles vão substituir e que devem estancar os vazamentos que esperamos.
 E será, será um dinheiro significativo que teremos que gastar com isso.
 e melhorias de HVAC.
 Então sabemos que fizemos muito disso.
 No momento, estamos ligando o ar condicionado.
 Portanto, há problemas associados a isso, certas áreas específicas aqui e ali que precisamos contratar nosso empreiteiro para consertar.
 Isto é por lei, temos que oferecer aquecimento até 15 de maio.
 Então esta seria a semana em que faremos o faturamento.
 Infelizmente, está quente esta semana, o que, você sabe, é bobagem, mas está quente esta semana.
 Alguns professores nas salas de aula se sentiram um pouco desconfortáveis, mas estamos trabalhando nisso.
 Nós sabemos que você está aí.
 Sairemos e cuidaremos de tudo o que for necessário o mais rápido possível, o mais rápido possível.
 ligando para o empreiteiro.
 Só estou tentando obter uma lista do que precisamos fazer e quais edifícios precisam ser feitos.
 Hum, o projeto de reabilitação do banheiro.
 Dave e eu nos encontramos com o arquiteto.
 Hum, acho que estávamos apenas esperando para obter autorização para ver e fazer as RFPs para esse projeto.
 Foi, eu sei que isso é um, hum,
 Projeto da Mefford High School que será próximo e querido por muitas pessoas que melhoram banheiros.
 Queremos, eu sei.
 O prefeito nos pediu para descobrir quantos poderíamos fazer.
 Acho que se conseguirmos o preço de um, saberemos onde estamos e então poderemos ir o mais longe que pudermos a partir daí.
 Ainda estamos à espera do projecto de reabilitação da entrada principal.
 para ver onde estamos indo com isso.
 Um dos nossos que trabalha na zeladoria é pedreiro, então se ofereceu para sair e tentar consertar um pouquinho a parede, a parede de granito.
 Então hoje ele está lá trabalhando.
 Quer dizer, espero poder fazer com que pareça um pouco melhor, mas ainda assim será
 O que, o que é, e então você sabe que certamente podemos nos encontrar na entrada principal e acho que conversaremos e discutiremos isso na próxima semana e o subcomitê sobre como queremos avançar com isso.
 E é por isso que acho que todo ano, dentro do meu orçamento, sempre encomendo um caminhão com arado.
 Então isso não mudou.
 Certamente ajudaria na neve, certamente ajudaria em outros projetos diversos em todo o distrito.
 Se algum dia conseguirmos um caminhão com arado.
 Assim, você sabe, posso ajudar muitas vezes o DPW, já que eles se movem muito rapidamente.
 E, você sabe, às vezes há áreas que precisam ser retocadas e para as quais não podem voltar porque o alvo principal são as estradas ao redor da cidade.
 Então certamente ajudaria na eficiência de ter algo assim.
 à nossa disposição, pick-up.
 Agora, a reforma do atual teatro e, se vocês verem meu relatório pré-orçamentário, eu acho.
 Se eu tivesse um projeto que gostaria de ver concretizado, seria adicionar ar condicionado, grades, atualizar as portas e fazer alguns trabalhos elétricos no teatro.
 Então, há alguns anos, recebi um preço e os preços são diferentes agora: US$ 100 mil para adicionar um aparelho de ar condicionado no teto do teatro.
 Acho que também seria benéfico para a comunidade.
 gerar receita para a escola também e talvez acrescentar isso em algum momento, colocá-lo em nossa lista de melhorias de capital.
 Só que, como eu disse, se eu pudesse escolher o projeto que gostaria de fazer com o ensino médio, esse seria um dos meus principais projetos, os projetos de reforma.
 E estamos sempre trabalhando em projetos de melhoria de HVAC na escola.
 Você sabe, em algum momento, talvez consigamos ajuda do MSBA, talvez possamos adicionar ar condicionado e outras partes da Mefford High School que não têm no momento, o que significa que o laboratório de ciências é a única parte real do prédio que tem ar condicionado.
 serviço, você sabe, exceto pelos aparelhos de ar condicionado de janela que temos em todos os lugares.
 Então não consigo ver o fundo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=1801.416s">[David Murphy]</a>: Acho que estamos no fundo.
 Bem.
 Sim.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=1804.117s">[John McLaughlin]</a>: Então, ficarei feliz em responder a quaisquer perguntas que você possa ter sobre o que está acontecendo.
 Uh, receberemos a maioria deles na próxima semana, dia 26.
 Teremos uma reunião do subcomitê aqui no Zoom.
 Uh, mas seria mais do que, uh,
 Bem-vindo para responder a quaisquer perguntas, obrigado.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=1823.649s">[David Murphy]</a>: Obrigado, João.
 Prefeito, recomendo que continuemos com nosso processo de apresentação e então eu, John, Dr. Edwards e outros teremos prazer em responder a quaisquer perguntas, se isso funcionar para você.
 Isso funciona para mim.
 Bem obrigado.
 Assim, à medida que avançamos para o resto da administração central, os gabinetes do superintendente e o meu próprio gabinete,
 Mencionamos antes que há vários departamentos que cabem nesses grandes guarda-chuvas.
 Edifícios e terrenos, certamente um dos maiores e, francamente, um dos mais visíveis.
 E certamente é por isso que pedimos ao Sr. McLaughlin que estivesse presente esta noite para falar sobre alguns detalhes.
 E passando rapidamente para o último ponto referente a este orçamento relacionado às atualizações de HVAC na escola secundária.
 Francamente, é um bom exemplo dessa distinção entre manutenção e capital.
 Quando atualizamos alguns dos filtros da escola para melhorar a qualidade do ar, incorremos em um custo fixo adicional com relação à substituição do filtro.
 Parte do uso de filtros de maior qualidade é que passamos de um sistema de substituição semestral para um trimestral.
 Francamente, isso não representa um custo significativo para o distrito, mas é um custo de manutenção.
 Ao contrário de uma caldeira,
 ou um gerador transformador, uma daquelas peças que certamente não temos expectativa de incorrer em custos anualmente.
 E isso é algo que incorporaríamos em um orçamento e planejamento de capital nos próximos anos.
 Assim, no que diz respeito ao orçamento do superintendente e ao orçamento do Gabinete de Finanças e Operações, há partes deste que, como mencionei antes, estão interligadas com algumas das outras prioridades e algumas das outras
 investimentos estratégicos que foram recomendados a você.
 Em primeiro lugar, no que diz respeito ao orçamento do superintendente, vocês ouviram o nosso foco ao longo deste ano, desculpem-me, ao longo do processo de desenvolvimento orçamental em garantir que estamos a identificar oportunidades de desenvolvimento profissional e formação para o pessoal que sejam consistentes com as necessidades do distrito durante este contexto pós-COVID.
 Bem, os US$ 75 mil, que na verdade podem ser um pouco menos do que isso, porque serão distribuídos por dois ou três anos fiscais.
 Então será um pouco menor que isso.
 Identificamos oportunidades de desenvolvimento profissional que serão intensivas e sensíveis ao contexto em que o distrito continuará a operar nos próximos anos.
 E assim temos um desenvolvimento profissional social e emocional específico.
 bem como a formação sobre preconceitos implícitos que começará efectivamente no final do AF21 e depois passará para os anos fiscais subsequentes, aberta inicialmente ao pessoal geral e aos administradores.
 Será um programa obrigatório no final do verão de 2021.
 Então se o Dr. Edouard-Vincent ou o Dr. Cushing quiserem falar um pouco mais sobre os benefícios e como vemos esse treinamento.
 como algo que se enquadra na estratégia geral que temos vindo a defender ao longo deste processo.
 E apenas um último ponto sobre isso.
 Prevejo que a maior parte deste financiamento para estas despesas será coberta por alguns dos fundos externos que referimos no início da apresentação.
 Assim, o Título II em particular, bem como potencialmente parte do financiamento do ESSER, mas o Título II será utilizado especificamente para cobrir os custos que serão incorridos no AF21.
 parte e depois passar para o ano fiscal de 22 também.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=2055.034s">[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>: Portanto, não tenho certeza se algum dos Drs. Eu só queria enfatizar o valor e a importância de
 desenvolvimento profissional de qualidade e também trabalhando verdadeiramente em colaboração com o Dr.
 Para abordar algumas das mudanças significativas que faremos no próximo ano, especialmente na área da aprendizagem socioemocional.
 Uma das áreas que foi cobrada do comitê escolar foi em termos de como o distrito abordará a suspensão, que se enquadra no âmbito dos comportamentos de aprendizagem socioemocional, etc.
 Então essa é definitivamente uma grande prioridade.
 para nós, e essa é uma das áreas-alvo do desenvolvimento profissional.
 Além disso, continuaremos a nossa busca pela compreensão e maior desenvolvimento profissional em torno dos preconceitos implícitos e das implicações para as nossas comunidades escolares.
 Também teremos desenvolvimento profissional adicional sobre as melhores práticas como líderes instrucionais e educadores.
 em relação ao sistema de avaliação de educadores para aumentar a responsabilização em todas as nossas escolas.
 Então esses são três cubos grandes.
 E quando abordamos o preconceito implícito, também abordamos a competência cultural, o trabalho anti-racista, o combate ao ódio,
 Portanto, todas essas iniciativas são muito importantes, pois estamos mudando como distrito para atender às necessidades de todos os nossos alunos e da comunidade em geral.
 Também continuaremos a olhar para a sensibilização para a deficiência e a encontrar formas, mais uma vez, de como isso se sobrepõe ao preconceito.
 que existem lá fora.
 Então, eu só queria enfatizar que, embora vejamos a nossa prioridade, as prioridades de todo o distrito em torno do desenvolvimento profissional, para mudar mentalidades e realmente apresentar novas informações, o desenvolvimento profissional é extremamente importante.
 Então, eu só queria enfatizar essa parte.
 Obrigado.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=2199.759s">[David Murphy]</a>: Obrigado, Superintendente.
 Dr. Cushing, há algo que você gostaria de acrescentar com base em seu envolvimento nesses programas?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=2207.372s">[Peter Cushing]</a>: Sim, muito rapidamente, o superintendente fez um trabalho maravilhoso explicando as posições que esperamos avançar.
 Além disso, o que estamos a fazer é que no final de Junho ofereceremos um programa de formação de formadores para preconceitos implícitos e aprendizagem socioemocional na sala de aula e cada um desses cursos terá 20 funcionários em todo o distrito.
 Uh, treinado para poder então implantar o distrito para implementar o desenvolvimento profissional dentro do distrito.
 E o que este modelo nos permitirá fazer é que nos permitirá ser muito rentáveis, mas também nos permitirá implementar o desenvolvimento profissional ao longo do ano da forma que melhor se adapta às necessidades de Medford.
 Hum, e poderemos envolver melhor nossa equipe.
 com seus colegas e líderes escolares, sejam eles diretores, diretores ou vice-diretores, que receberão esses treinamentos e então darão a volta por cima e serão capazes de implementar por si mesmos esse desenvolvimento profissional de classe mundial.
 E acho que é uma grande oportunidade para Medford dar o próximo passo no sentido de proporcionar o melhor desenvolvimento profissional possível para nossa equipe.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=2280.431s">[David Murphy]</a>: Obrigado, Dr.
 E então vá para o escritório de finanças e operações.
 E como você pode ver, existem alguns pontos diferentes aqui.
 Vou me concentrar em três, incluindo transporte, que acho que tem seu próprio slide e tem, obrigado.
 Mas primeiro, os dois primeiros, isso foi mencionado durante a apresentação da noite passada.
 E acho que surgiu no contexto da prioridade identificada pelo departamento de aprendizagem de inglês.
 querer investir numa oportunidade de desenvolver os nossos esforços, essencialmente o nosso compromisso familiar e as nossas relações comunitárias.
 E observei na época que parte do motivo pelo qual não identificamos um investimento específico no departamento EL especificamente para o exercício financeiro de 22 é porque temos um investimento do distrito que esperamos que promova essa causa e estaremos trabalhando nisso.
 estreitamente com o departamento EL, departamento de serviços de saúde, educação especial e outros.
 Acho que quando pensamos em como estruturamos a organização e como organizamos portfólios específicos de trabalho, como regra geral, a melhor prática é identificar a necessidade, identificar a necessidade que está sendo atendida ou uma necessidade que está se desenvolvendo como resultado de outras variáveis de mudança,
 e então determinar a melhor forma de desenvolver funções e portfólios que se encaixem em uma estrutura organizacional que possa promover esses objetivos.
 No entanto, há momentos em que há uma confluência de eventos em que temos pessoas em funções de liderança com capacidade disponível e necessidades que estão a surgir e a tornar-se mais urgentes.
 E esse tipo de confluência ocorreu durante todo o ano letivo.
 E vou ser franco, uma das formas que nos chamou a atenção foi quando precisámos deslocar toda a nossa unidade administrativa para as escolas para servirem como professores substitutos.
 E quando ficou claro que isso era exaustivo e praticamente impossível, e tentamos fazer diferentes modificações, nossa diretora de programação antes e depois da escola continuou a se voluntariar para assumir isso e continuou a nos comunicar, como fazia há algum tempo, que sentia que
 Havia espaço no seu portfólio para responsabilidades adicionais e o tipo de confidências, a competência que temos no indivíduo como gestor e como líder.
 E o facto de termos conseguido passar este ano lectivo, mas ao sermos capazes de identificar práticas que podemos melhorar e trabalhar melhor na área do envolvimento dos pais e da família,
 estava contando com a ajuda de Diane Caldwell, nossa ex-superintendente associada, que atuou muito habilmente como diretora sênior do Centro de Informações aos Pais.
 E direi, como alguém novo no distrito e que herdou o Centro de Informação aos Pais como parte do meu portfólio na minha primeira semana, sem a Sra.
 Caldwell,
 Estando disponível para fornecer essa liderança e fornecer essa orientação e conhecimento institucional, teria sido um ano muito, muito mais desafiador, não apenas no que diz respeito à supervisão do PIC, mas no que diz respeito essencialmente a todos os outros elementos do trabalho pelo qual eu e outros administradores seniores somos responsáveis.
 Mas sabemos desde o início que a Sra.
 Caldwell como administrador do Centro de Informação aos Pais não era uma solução permanente e tentar operar dentro
 De acordo com os nossos parâmetros orçamentais, não pretendíamos necessariamente financiar um Diretor do Centro de Informação aos Pais como um cargo único, sem outras responsabilidades.
 E então a Sra.
 Fidler transmite disposição e entusiasmo para assumir responsabilidades adicionais.
 E o que sentimos é uma forte ligação natural entre o Centro de Informação aos Pais e o Programa Escolas Pobres e Ausentes, bem como apoio adicional
 uh, capacidade que precisávamos, hum, precisávamos na, na, na área de relações familiares com relação ao transporte.
 Hum, achamos que isso se encaixaria como um portfólio administrativo legítimo e completo.
 E assim, como parte do orçamento para o ano fiscal de 22, propomos reorganizar esses escritórios em uma área geral de envolvimento familiar que incluirá a supervisão do centro de informações aos pais, a supervisão contínua do programa antes e depois da escola.
 e serviço como ligação de transporte.
 Agora, francamente, uma das razões pelas quais todas essas funções se encaixam é que são partes diferentes do ano letivo onde requerem um maior grau de atenção e detalhe.
 E é por isso que digo que é uma espécie de confluência no sentido de que cabe muito bem no sentido de criar uma função completa de 12 meses com alguém que já tem o conhecimento institucional.
 e fez um excelente trabalho para o distrito no passado.
 E é por isso que ser capaz de fazê-lo de forma eficiente, mas também com confiança em como isso promoveria de forma mais eficaz os objetivos do distrito em torno das parcerias familiares e comunitárias, faz parte de como essa proposta foi desenvolvida.
 Então isso é uma peça.
 E então você verá, como também foi mencionado ontem à noite,
 Estabelecemos uma posição de coordenador de subsídios.
 Isso por si só é uma coisa não orçamentária, não tem necessariamente um efeito sobre o orçamento operacional e os subsídios que o indivíduo que tem servido essencialmente como coordenador não oficial de subsídios há algum tempo, mas tecnicamente na função de assistente executivo, conseguimos transferir essa pessoa para o escritório de finanças e operações, trabalhando com Michelle Kingdon e sua equipe para garantir que estamos
 Cumprir todas as nossas obrigações e executar a partir de uma perspectiva de conformidade da forma mais eficaz possível.
 Isso é diferente e quero ressaltar isso.
 É certamente diferente do papel de redator de subsídios que não temos atualmente, mas estamos explorando outras maneiras de liberar alguma capacidade para dar aos administradores a oportunidade de estarem bem posicionados para cultivar parcerias externas e
 e procurar oportunidades de subvenções que o nosso coordenador de subvenções estaria então em posição de ajudar a coordenar e tentar libertar capacidade orçamental adicional dessa forma.
 Antes de falarmos sobre transporte, direi apenas, mais uma vez, que é uma espécie de continuação da nossa conversa de ontem à noite.
 Continuamos nossa parceria ao longo deste ano letivo com a Management Solution e o Sr. Paquette, que atuou como interino
 administrador de empresas entre a Sra.
 Patterson e eu.
 E temos o relatório que foi encomendado pronto para ser entregue à comissão escolar.
 Basicamente, solicitei uma adenda ao relatório porque o relatório foi elaborado ao longo do ano lectivo e de alguma forma contribuiu para este processo de desenvolvimento orçamental.
 E perguntei ao Sr. Parkett se, com base no adiantamento que ainda temos,
 Basicamente, você pode preencher um pequeno suplemento que levaria em conta algumas das alterações que fizemos, Sra.
 Kimu e eu colocamos isso em prática nos últimos meses.
 É por isso que prevejo entregá-lo ao comitê antes do final deste ano fiscal.
 E então, Sr. Parkett, nossa parceria com a Tufts University, que começou como uma parceria de testes e progrediu para conversas.
 no âmbito das infra-estruturas tecnológicas e algo de que espero que possamos beneficiar de forma muito eficiente ao longo do Verão.
 Mas então também procuraremos explorar que outros conhecimentos externos devemos reter ou potencialmente consultar à medida que olhamos para o EF22.
 Essa é uma visão geral de alto nível.
 Terminarei com o transporte e depois passarei às suas perguntas.
 Se você se lembra quando falamos sobre as projeções para o ano fiscal de 22, tivemos um aumento de custo de cerca de 51.000.
 Estas são, devo dizer rapidamente, porque foram abordadas em 6 de maio.
 Estes não estão relacionados aos nossos custos fixos de transporte relacionados à nossa educação especial.
 Este é o nosso principal fornecedor, a Eastern Bus.
 O comitê escolar celebrou um novo contrato de três anos na primavera de 2020.
 Então, estamos concluindo o primeiro deles.
 do contrato de três anos.
 Como sempre acontece com os contratos, o custo aumenta ano após ano.
 Portanto, prevemos um aumento de aproximadamente US$ 51.000 nesse contrato como parte de nosso aumento estimado de US$ 2,1 milhões em custos fixos.
 Você já viu os dois números a seguir, em 26 de abril, quando foi feita uma solicitação sobre passes MBTA.
 Essa é essencialmente uma opção que estamos
 certificando-se de que o comitê esteja ciente.
 E então houve questões relacionadas a qual seria essencialmente o custo dos ônibus amarelos adicionais e o potencial fornecimento de capacidade adicional de ônibus do Eastside na escola secundária.
 Estimamos que seja em torno de US$ 75 mil.
 A razão pela qual digo que é de zero a US$ 75.000 é que em nossas conversas com o fornecedor, eles têm,
 Eu acho, e agradeço isso, não sei se todos os fornecedores fariam isso, mas eles sugeriram que, com base no raio que este distrito adotou antes deste ano letivo, seja possível que, no que diz respeito ao transporte escolar fundamental e médio, seja possível redirecionar parte da nossa capacidade existente para fornecer pelo menos um ônibus adicional para a escola secundária.
 Temos reuniões na próxima semana com
 o fornecedor de ônibus, bem como o Departamento de Polícia de Medford, onde discutiremos uma série de questões, tanto relacionadas à segurança quanto ao planejamento do desenvolvimento de rotas e paradas para o próximo ano letivo durante o verão.
 Então, francamente, não tenho nenhuma recomendação para o comitê neste momento sobre se deveríamos adicionar um segundo ônibus.
 Acho que está claro que podemos fazer isso.
 E então acho que é uma questão de observar os dados sobre onde
 o que são os alunos do ensino médio e se há demanda para isso.
 Direi que nas minhas breves conversas com a administração do ensino secundário, não está nada claro se sabemos que existe uma procura clara para isto, o que é algo que penso que queremos manter em mente.
 Mas, ao mesmo tempo, se o custo de fornecer algo que poderia ser muito mais conveniente para os estudantes estiver entre zero e US$ 75 mil, obviamente isso é algo que gostaríamos de considerar.
 Penso que, de uma perspectiva estratégica, precisamos ter em mente que os passes MBTA obviamente proporcionam potencialmente mais acesso.
 E, você sabe, você começa a pensar em empregos de estudante, na oportunidade de ir para a cidade.
 Existem outros tipos de experiências na cidade, como salas de aula e experiências de aprendizagem experiencial que os passes MBTA podem proporcionar aos alunos.
 Estamos analisando todas essas opções.
 E, mais uma vez, um fio condutor comum a todas as apresentações é a nossa determinação em estabelecer um dia letivo alargado eficaz e uma programação extracurricular para os nossos alunos no ano letivo 21-22, utilizando fundos ESSER para garantir que fornecemos o maior apoio de recuperação possível na sequência das perturbações significativas que os alunos enfrentaram.
 Portanto, agradeço-lhe pelo seu tempo e pela sua indulgência a este respeito.
 Se você gostou das apresentações quando havia mais depoimentos e testemunhas a quem eu poderia entregá-las, prometo que gostei mais delas também.
 Mas esses são os registros de edifícios e terrenos, do escritório de finanças e operações, bem como do escritório do superintendente.
 E neste momento, terei o maior prazer em responder às suas perguntas.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3062.978s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Obrigado, Sr.
 Temos o membro Van der Kloot, depois o membro Rousseau.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3068.903s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Obrigado.
 Continuarei no final sobre o transporte de ônibus escolar.
 Dave, você nos apresentou algumas opções interessantes, mas com grandes diferenças de preços.
 Neste ponto, enquanto você está criando este orçamento,
 O que você é, está nos fazendo uma recomendação?
 Vamos, quer dizer, como vamos incluir o custo no orçamento?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3100.169s">[David Murphy]</a>: Bem, acho que a primeira, sim, a primeira determinação é se o comitê está confortável com o raio que foi estabelecido no ano passado em relação ao raio de uma milha para todas as séries, exceto o jardim de infância.
 Então, se isso é algo que o comitê quer manter,
 então o vendedor basicamente disse que uma das escolas primárias terá capacidade excedente.
 Portanto, o contrato existente que seria de US$ 1,4 milhão ou algo parecido para a Eastern Bus nos fornecerá um ônibus escolar adicional que acho que provavelmente deveríamos considerar usar na escola secundária para expandir essa capacidade.
 Minha única dúvida é
 que, se não o fizéssemos, poderíamos redirecioná-lo para programação extracurricular e dias letivos estendidos, sem esse custo potencial adicional de US$ 100.000.
 Ou pelo menos isso custaria.
 Portanto, acho que a primeira determinação é se o comitê está confortável com o raio de uma milha, que o fornecedor diz que não terá um impacto dramático no número de passageiros.
 E essencialmente é onde estamos agora.
 E se for esse o caso,
 Então acho que o próximo passo é olhar os dados relacionados ao local onde residem os alunos do ensino médio e se existe ou não um caminho que faça sentido saber onde os alunos estão.
 E, novamente, a única desvantagem que eu veria nesse plano é que a MBTA aprova, eles não apenas levam você para a escola.
 E eu acho que, especialmente para nossos alunos do ensino médio, há uma enorme quantidade de oportunidades de aprendizagem experiencial que os passes da MBTA poderiam abrir para eles.
 E a última coisa que eu diria é que o passe MBTA se tornou um investimento muito melhor se vincularmos oportunidades programáticas à sua aquisição.
 E penso que pode levar algum tempo, talvez o verão seja suficiente, para dar aos nossos líderes instrucionais tempo para desenvolverem esses tipos de oportunidades que maximizem esse investimento potencial.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3230.138s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Então, Dave, vamos voltar a uma das coisas que você disse sobre o raio de uma milha.
 E devo dizer que não me lembro de ter votado nisso.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3239.024s">[David Murphy]</a>: Então... Isso era anterior à minha época, mas meu entendimento é que quando esse plano de reabertura foi apresentado em massa ao comitê escolar como uma espécie de plano grande e multifacetado, o rádio fazia parte disso.
 E assim as rotas e paradas foram ajustadas.
 Eu também acho, e sei disso apenas de forma anedótica,
 Isso porque o número de passageiros caiu tanto este ano que normalmente você elimina os pontos de ônibus e ouve uma espécie de onda de feedback, que não se materializou este ano.
 E pode ser porque o número de passageiros diminuiu muito devido à pandemia.
 Se isso não for transferido para o próximo ano, é algo que você provavelmente deseja considerar.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3280.253s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sim, seria, acho que foi perfeitamente compreensível que nosso número de passageiros tenha caído muito.
 Eu sei que em Medford há um histórico de alguns estudantes receberem serviço de ônibus devido a preocupações com as estradas onde moram e com a segurança no trânsito.
 Então, automaticamente dizendo que é uma milha, bem, nunca foi automaticamente uma milha.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3307.655s">[David Murphy]</a>: Um ponto importante, e peço desculpas por isso,
 Se presumir que isso é desnecessário dizer, o raio não tem nada a ver com isenções de segurança.
 E o seu ponto de ônibus faz parte da conversa que teremos na próxima semana.
 E é por isso que não só o distrito e o vendedor estarão representados, mas também a Polícia Metropolitana.
 Porque à medida que revisamos e analisamos rotas e paragens, queremos garantir que quaisquer paragens que suscitem preocupações de segurança sejam examinadas de perto por especialistas em segurança pública e que
 Sem dúvida, as isenções de segurança substituem quaisquer outras políticas relativas ao rádio.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3344.167s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sim, bem, parte disso é, você sabe, segurança percebida ou está em vigor há tanto tempo que qualquer movimento para removê-la certamente causará um alvoroço.
 Parece que estou ouvindo você de maneira otimista, teremos algum espaço e poderemos usar um ônibus existente.
 Isso me parece muito otimista, Dave, e sou otimista em geral, mas não estou pronto para equilibrar um ao outro.
 Sim, e no topo de linha são 350, o que é uma grande mudança.
 E há alguns, só estou tentando dizer que, com um número tão grande, é difícil entender exatamente para onde vamos chegar em termos do que estamos colocando no orçamento.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3389.268s">[David Murphy]</a>: Sim, tudo isso é um bom ponto.
 Estes dados respondem às dúvidas da comissão, para ser claro.
 Não, não tenho, certamente não tenho uma recomendação sobre a origem dos 350 mil.
 Então, para ser honesto sobre isso.
 Bem.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3403.415s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sim.
 E, ao mesmo tempo, agradeço que os meus colegas tenham levantado esta questão porque é uma questão e é uma questão de justiça.
 Então, acho claramente que teremos mais conversas sobre isso.
 Bem.
 Eu me entrego a outra pessoa.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3421.005s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Temos o membro Rousseau, o membro Kreatz, Graham e McLaughlin.</p>

 Obrigado pela apresentação.
 Eu agradeço.
 Eu me pergunto onde, e me perdoe se já cobrimos isso, mas não acho que tenhamos transporte para esportes e banda.
 E isso ainda está por vir?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3448.128s">[David Murphy]</a>: A questão é: isso está incluído nos dados que você apresenta esta noite?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3452.33s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: Sim.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3453.891s">[David Murphy]</a>: Não, mas apenas porque ele vive dos orçamentos para esportes ou artes plásticas.
 E então essas linhas serão restauradas ao seu ano fiscal.
 Um deles nunca foi reduzido, mas serão mantidos ou restaurados aos seus números do ano fiscal de 2020.
 Então, para garantir que tenhamos transporte suficiente para todos os eventos e eventos esportivos e coisas dessa natureza.
 E isso foi a pedido dos chefes de departamento.
 Portanto, tanto quanto sei, não houve nenhum pedido para exceder os níveis pré-EF21.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3487.681s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: Bem obrigado.
 É que, você sabe, parece que lembrar da pré-pandemia às vezes é realmente um desafio, mas, você sabe, minha memória é essa, você sabe,
 Não tivemos uma distribuição equitativa dos fundos de transporte para diferentes tipos de grupos, por isso vou apenas dizer.
 Fomos mais do que generosos com o financiamento do transporte relacionado aos esportes e o pessoal da banda teve que vender tudo o que tinha para conseguir dinheiro suficiente para o transporte de ônibus.
 E este é meu quarto orçamento.
 E há quatro anos, não sou o único que diz
 Precisamos de um detalhamento de quanto gastamos em atividades extracurriculares por aluno.
 Porque confiando no meu instinto, não tenho filhos para praticar esportes.
 Tenho filhos que participam da banda.
 Não estou interessado em fazer grandes declarações ou sugerir mudanças políticas sem quaisquer dados.
 Mas a minha sensação, quando olho para as bolsas desportivas,
 Os treinadores do nosso contrato versus as pessoas que dirigem a banda e outras remunerações, claramente há algum tipo de discrepância que pode ser apropriada com base no número de horas dedicadas, mas não tenho como saber.
 Então, eu realmente quero saber se não estamos favorecendo as crianças que decidem praticar um esporte e reduzindo o fardo de suas famílias para arrecadar fundos para transporte.
 em comparação com crianças que estão na banda ou, e estou apenas usando esses dois exemplos.
 Tenho certeza de que existem outros.
 Portanto, a restauração é obviamente melhor do que nenhuma restauração, mas não tenho como saber se isso é realmente justo.
 E isso é muito importante para mim.
 E este é o quarto orçamento em que isto tem sido um problema.
 O quarto ano onde eu queria, e percebo que você não estava nos últimos três orçamentos.
 Então, você sabe, detalhando por aluno, quanto estamos gastando?
 E quero dizer, isso inclui os estipêndios que estão nos contratos dos professores.
 E isso, quero dizer, todo o dinheiro que gastamos em educação, não do jardim de infância até a oitava série, em que estamos gastando?
 Para onde ele está indo?
 E é realmente justo?
 Quer dizer, porque sei que os esportes são muito importantes para muitas pessoas,
 A proibição é muito importante para muitas pessoas.
 E eu realmente acho que temos que chegar ao fundo disso.
 Não creio que isso seja algo que possamos resolver esta noite.
 E fiquei surpreso por não ter uma ideia real se isso está sendo abordado ou não.
 Mas reparei, claro, que não esteve presente nos últimos três orçamentos.
 Sim.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3661.661s">[David Murphy]</a>: Não, é uma ótima pergunta.
 E eu acho que você está certo.
 Quer dizer, às vezes existem diferentes níveis de despesas.
 Eu acho que na maioria das vezes,
 Esta discrepância é criada nos distritos devido ao sistema de paz que existe em torno do atletismo.
 E eu acho que é assim que muitas vezes você acaba vendo essa discrepância, mas eles desempenham um papel muito paralelo em termos de serem o elemento do nosso programa educacional que envolve os alunos e os mantém vindo aqui francamente e certamente se divertindo e aproveitando ao máximo sua educação.
 Então, estou feliz em investigar isso e ver se há
 se houver lacunas que potencialmente precisamos ajudar a superar.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3704.757s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: Obrigado.
 Então acho que vou fazer minha outra pergunta, vejo que existem projetos relacionados a banheiros.
 Novamente, este é meu quarto ano e este é o quarto ano em que os alunos estão fazendo o trabalho duro para descobrir como levar produtos menstruais para nossos alunos.
 É constrangedor.
 Sei que nem todos nesta reunião concordam necessariamente, mas é constrangedor.
 Há quatro anos consecutivos que existem projetos de CCSR para garantir que as estudantes que estão menstruadas não tenham problemas no acesso a estes produtos.
 É um pouco alucinante.
 E só quero deixar claro que não votarei em nenhum
 reformas de banheiros se não incluírem dispensadores gratuitos de produtos menstruais em cada banheiro reformado.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3762.382s">[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>: Dr. Édouard-Vincent?
 Só quero comentar, Deputado Ruseau, que quando o fizer
 As falas vão fazer acreditar que quando as alunas usam o banheiro e não têm acesso a produtos femininos no ensino médio, temos uma sala médica inteira.
 Produtos femininos são colocados nos banheiros, mas infelizmente, às vezes, os produtos femininos não são utilizados para a finalidade adequada.
 São usados, são decorados nos banheiros, vão parar no teto.
 Isso também aconteceu várias vezes.
 E isso com pessoas supervisionando e monitorando os banheiros.
 Então colocamos vocês lá, alunos do CCSR,
 Assumo isso como um projeto, mas quero que as pessoas saibam que há produtos femininos disponíveis na sala médica e que o acesso dos alunos não é negado.
 Temos uma vasta gama de produtos no setor médico e não me oponho a obter máquinas às quais os alunos possam ter acesso, mas quero apenas salientar que, quando as fornecemos, não foram utilizadas para o fim adequado.
 o que foi parte do motivo pelo qual acabaram sendo eliminados no passado.
 Então, só quero dizer que não estamos tentando nos dirigir aos alunos ou dizer-lhes que, você sabe, não está disponível.
 Quero que todos saibam que está disponível e que há suprimentos suficientes na sala médica do ensino médio, em particular, e também nas escolas secundárias.
 Está disponível em todas as consultas de enfermagem.</p>

 Eu simplesmente sugeriria que pegássemos um mapa da escola e imaginássemos um aluno que está no ponto mais distante da sala médica.
 E quero dizer, dos membros do comitê escolar, sou o único aqui
 Ele não teve essas experiências.
 Estou apenas fazendo suposições sobre todos vocês, mas, vocês sabem, nem eu consigo imaginar estar tão longe da sala médica quanto vocês podem estar neste prédio que é enorme e dizem que vocês sabem onde fica.
 Passei por aquele prédio para chegar ao que quer que fosse.
 E digo, antes de mais nada, não é uma caminhada de dois minutos.
 Estamos conversando, quer dizer, nem sei qual é o momento, mas acho,
 a barreira para o que consideramos acesso parece ser muito, muito baixa ou alta, conforme a analogia correta.
 E eu, você sabe, há outros distritos que fizeram isso e eu não, eles não aparecem na primeira página do mundo como um grande problema.
 E eu entendo que, você sabe, o que li sobre, você sabe, saúde, não é a Lei da Juventude Saudável, esqueci que lei era que realmente exigia isso nas escolas no ano passado,
 Mas há uma situação inicial em que, quando você os instala pela primeira vez e os disponibiliza gratuitamente, eles ficam presos no teto e as crianças que precisam deles podem levar para casa cestos cheios deles.
 Mas, como acontece com muitas coisas, eles ficarão entediados.
 E então, quando os alunos precisarem deles, eles estarão lá.
 Portanto, não pretendo que este seja um projeto fácil.
 Eu apenas acredito firmemente que
 O CCSR, acho que foi um projeto do CCSR, e chegou à minha caixa de entrada no Facebook, acho que há uma semana, sobre alunos fazendo isso.
 Eles não estão fazendo isso porque não têm mais nada para fazer.
 Então acho que não estamos ouvindo os alunos.
 Estou olhando a página de 2016 do CCSR e esse é um dos projetos desse ano.
 E não sei quando chegaremos a isso, mas obrigado.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4012.217s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Obrigado, Membro Crest e Membro Graham, Membro McLaughlin.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4015.74s">[Kathy Kreatz]</a>: Sim, eu só queria dizer obrigado.
 Em primeiro lugar, só tenho uma pergunta sobre transporte, mas antes de tudo queria que todos soubessem que as apresentações foram excelentes e Sr. McLaughlin, você fez um ótimo trabalho e quais serão esses itens da agenda.
 Estará na agenda da próxima semana para que possamos discutir na próxima semana na reunião do subcomitê.
 Então a dúvida que tenho também é sobre transporte.
 Algumas coisas sobre isso porque abri o boletim informativo porque não me lembro de estar num raio de um quilômetro.
 Então eu li o boletim de transporte durante Kobe 2021, e diz aqui que todas as escolas públicas não transportarão alunos em uma escola amarela, qualquer que seja seu endereço físico em um raio de três quilômetros da escola que frequentam.
 Entendemos que esta mudança é um fardo significativo e sempre fornecemos transporte que excede a regulamentação.
 Portanto, nem tenho certeza se tenho as informações corretas.
 Sr. Murphy, o que você mencionou, eu também não tenho essa informação.
 Não me lembro de ter tido uma reunião sobre isso.
 Então, eu só queria mencionar isso.
 Eu conheço a Sra.
 Van der Kloot falou sobre isso.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4092.141s">[David Murphy]</a>: Senhor, só estou tentando esclarecer.
 E digo isso com o tipo de isenção de responsabilidade que isso acontecia antes de eu estar aqui, mas estou envolvido nisso desde então.
 E se alguém, se algum dos meus colegas quiser partilhar as suas memórias, por favor não o faça.
 Mas, como me explicaram, foi que quando o comitê recebeu o raio de 2,0 milhas,
 Eu entendi que isso era para as séries do ensino médio.
 Houve uma restrição nisso novamente, como eu, acho que me disseram cerca de um quilômetro e meio no nível elementar que essencialmente não era aplicado.
 E que, para reduzir o número total de pessoas que viajam de ônibus, seria necessário informar ao fornecedor para impor esse raio de uma milha no nível primário e de duas milhas no nível secundário.
 Ei, ele.
 O número de pessoas que viajam de ônibus caiu tão significativamente que, francamente, não está claro se o fornecedor precisava impor o raio de uma milha.
 E isso, aliás, devo dizer, também não se aplica ao jardim de infância.
 Portanto, as exceções são as isenções de segurança para o jardim de infância e alunos com deficiência, assim como o transporte no âmbito do IEP, claro que também não está relacionado a esta conversa.
 Mas os raios de uma e duas milhas, um foi baseado na restrição COVID e o outro foi
 Basicamente, é uma restrição não imposta que, francamente, não é incomum nos bairros, especialmente quando há espaço no ônibus.
 E é isso que iríamos abordar neste verão em termos de planeamento de rotas e paragens com o fornecedor naquele raio.
 E o fornecedor avisou que se fizéssemos isso provavelmente teríamos dentro dos 18 ônibus previstos no contrato.
 que foi aprovado no ano passado, provavelmente precisaremos apenas de uma frota de 17 ônibus, e isso liberaria o dia 18 para potencialmente um segundo ônibus na escola secundária.
 Então eu acho, Dr. Cushing, que vi você levantar a mão.
 Se eu estava errado sobre alguma coisa, sinta-se à vontade para me corrigir.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4219.238s">[Peter Cushing]</a>: Você não falou mal.
 Você falou com muita precisão.
 Acho que se você pudesse dizer que um dos aspectos positivos da pandemia foi que ela realmente fortaleceu o relacionamento entre os diretores das escolas,
 E peço desculpa à pessoa a nível municipal e aos pais que não mencionam o seu nome, mas que realmente trabalham em rotas seguras para a escola como forma de também reduzir a nossa pegada de combustíveis fósseis com o número de autocarros que param e vão e criando autocarros escolares a pé, formas seguras para os alunos irem e voltarem da escola.
 e procurar outras formas de garantir que estávamos a proporcionar oportunidades seguras para as crianças irem à escola e, ao mesmo tempo, perceber que, embora esta fosse uma questão impulsionada pela pandemia, havia outras questões relacionadas com combustíveis fósseis, trânsito, congestionamento e coisas assim, que também foram tidas em conta quando tivemos estas conversas no ano passado, eu diria, todos os nossos diretores de escolas nos níveis primário e secundário.
 Eles se reuniram com pessoas para mapear rotas para suas escolas.
 Obtivemos dados de mapeamento GIS de onde todos os nossos alunos estavam.
 Fizemos uma análise bastante completa para realmente analisar tudo isso quando chegamos à pandemia e, em seguida, analisamos as oportunidades que poderiam existir decorrentes da pandemia para mudar hábitos e mentalidades.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4309.15s">[Kathy Kreatz]</a>: Obrigado.
 Obrigado.
 Só tenho mais uma pergunta e pode ser uma informação de saúde para o próximo ano letivo.
 E Sr. Murphy, não tenho certeza se você já estava presente, mas Patterson estava ciente disso.
 Porque a gente volta para a escola antes do Dia do Trabalho, e com o MBTA, nos dias que antecedem o Dia do Trabalho, o MBTA não funciona para alunos do ensino médio, então sempre houve preocupação.
 Durante os primeiros dias antes do Dia do Trabalho, quando as crianças voltam à escola.
 Eu, você sabe, recebíamos mensagens de que os alunos estavam esperando no ponto de ônibus e o ônibus não estava lá.
 Eles acabaram caminhando e se atrasaram para a escola.
 Então, em preparação para o próximo ano letivo.
 Foi adicionado um ônibus escolar amarelo que percorre algumas das paradas mais frequentes para buscar alunos do ensino médio durante os primeiros dias.
 Não consigo me lembrar de todos os detalhes, mas só queria que vocês soubessem sobre isso, que tem sido um problema constante.
 todos os anos porque começamos antes do Dia do Trabalho.
 E então, logo após o Dia do Trabalho, os ônibus do MBT funcionarão no horário escolar normal.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4398.254s">[David Murphy]</a>: Sra.
 Kreatz, eu realmente aprecio isso.
 Não é algo com o qual estou familiarizado.
 Vou me educar o mais rápido possível.
 Minha primeira pergunta é o que acontece com aquele ônibus depois do Dia do Trabalho?
 Porque se estiver disponível naquela semana, ficaria um pouco curioso para saber como ou por que estaria disponível.
 Eu diria em resposta a isso,</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4416.775s">[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>: É uma prática antiga em Medford, e a Eastern Bus Company sabe disso porque começamos a escola mais cedo do que muitos distritos vizinhos, então eles fazem isso e podem embaralhar seus ônibus para nos ajudar nos primeiros três dias antes que outros distritos comecem.
 Então, eles conseguiram fazer isso e é algo que eles conhecem e com certeza continuaremos essa prática, membro Kreatz.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4444.807s">[David Murphy]</a>: Obrigado.
 Sim, penso que certamente continuaremos a praticar, mas também, nas nossas reuniões com a Eastern Bus, penso que também iremos insistir na questão de qual é a capacidade, porque o sentimento que ouvi da comissão quando discutimos isto no dia 26 de Abril foi que se houvesse uma forma rentável de fornecer transporte adicional em autocarro amarelo para a escola secundária, então isso é algo que deveríamos considerar.
 Então, mas isso é, novamente, teremos muitas conversas e eles têm sido um parceiro muito bom.
 muito receptivo ao longo do último ano.
 Portanto, a minha esperança é que possamos continuar esse diálogo com eles.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4480.762s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Obrigado.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4482.966s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Membro Graham.
 Obrigado.
 Eu realmente apreciei a atenção ao desenvolvimento profissional que foi dada nas recomendações do superintendente e certamente os modelos de formação de formadores podem ser realmente eficazes, desde que haja um plano de sustentabilidade que acompanhe a formação de formadores e não seja um
 uma startup inicial que falha porque recomeçar em um trem, o plano de ônibus é muito caro, então só quero ter certeza de que temos planos de sustentabilidade em vigor para realmente maximizar esse investimento.
 Sobre o tema do transporte, gostaria de fazer uma moção para que o orçamento inclua ou assuma que não haverá custos de transporte para os nossos alunos a partir do início do ano letivo 21-22.
 E que a administração nos trará um plano abrangente que estabeleça uma recomendação de transporte para o distrito até 1º de agosto.
 E a razão pela qual adicionei isso no final é porque
 Tenho ouvido muitas pessoas que as crianças que pegam o ônibus da MBTA significam que muitas vezes chegam atrasadas e não são confiáveis, e que os pais estão tomando outras providências para levar seus filhos à escola porque não sentem que podem confiar nos ônibus da MBTA.
 A ideia de que ainda existem outros estudantes que dependem muito desses passes de ônibus da MBTA para poder
 poder trabalhar e andar de ônibus de uma maneira diferente não é algo que eu tenha ouvido falar pessoalmente, mas não quero desconsiderar o fato de que há membros da comunidade que estão nessa posição.
 Então, eu gostaria que abordássemos novamente o transporte e que todos vocês trabalhassem com a Eastern Bus, o departamento de polícia e quem quer que seja.
 e esperamos que a comunidade descubra o melhor caminho a seguir.
 Também lhe direi, Dr. Cushing, que me lembro da conversa sobre o raio de uma ou duas milhas e coisas semelhantes sobre a não aplicação do raio no nível do ensino fundamental.
 Quando o Sr. Murphy estava falando sobre o jardim de infância ser uma exceção, acho que comecei a pensar que se fosse aplicado assim,
 uma milha versus duas milhas ou algo assim.
 E, no entanto, você ainda precisa buscar alunos do jardim de infância em algum lugar que não iria antes.
 Como você, prática ou taticamente, só atende alunos do jardim de infância no raio mais próximo?
 Então, sinto que há muita conversa sobre transporte para acertar.
 Mas quero que o orçamento reflita inequivocamente que os alunos não terão dificuldades em ir à escola no próximo ano, ponto final.
 Você gostaria de fazer a chamada ou devo fazer outras perguntas?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4679.808s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Eu só quero, vocês querem isso, só não sei o que o administrador vai colocar no orçamento se não precisar nos passar esse plano até 1º de agosto.
 Então, só quero ter certeza de que isso está claro para a administração e a equipe financeira.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4694.075s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Presumo que a equipe financeira possa descobrir isso até o momento em que obtivermos o orçamento final.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4699.617s">[David Murphy]</a>: Bem, acho que a única coisa que eu diria, Merrick,
 é que entendo que a moção significa que não queremos que nenhum aluno dependa de um passe MBTA que deve comprar com seu próprio dinheiro para ir à escola.
 Agora, acho que existem diferentes maneiras de explorar isso.
 Acho que a maneira mais econômica será com um ônibus amarelo adicional, pelo menos um ônibus amarelo adicional.
 E como eu disse, isso poderia ser sem nenhum custo.
 Em teoria, isso poderia ser neutro em termos orçamentais.
 Acho que, além disso, poderia haver mais de um ônibus amarelo, e então poderia haver qualquer coisa além de um ônibus que certamente teria algum tipo de impacto no orçamento.
 E então acho que a outra questão que temos que abordar é que haverá estudantes que vão querer o passe MBTA com desconto.
 Não aceito a moção que sugere que descontinuemos nossa parceria com a MBTA e paremos de oferecer passes MBTA porque se houver estudantes que queiram comprar o passe por qualquer motivo,
 Certamente queremos que nossos alunos possam obter um passe com desconto da mesma forma que os alunos de outros distritos escolares.
 Então acho que continuaremos com o programa, mas acho que só precisaremos examinar essencialmente qual é o uso do passe entre os alunos.
 E então, se dependerem disso, precisamos cobrir o custo do passe MBTA ou criar uma opção alternativa para os alunos chegarem à escola.
 Agora eu acho que
 Tudo isso se resume a quantos passes vendemos e quantos estudantes que os compram dependem deles.
 E então qual seria o trajeto de um ônibus amarelo?
 Certamente existem camadas para isso, mas certamente há uma orientação clara do comitê.
 Se tivermos algum problema em termos de execução, seja do ponto de vista orçamental, seja logístico, voltaremos.
 Para mim é concebível que possa haver um grupo de estudantes
 quando dizemos, bem, você está comprando este passe porque precisa dele para ir para a escola, porque precisa ir para o trabalho, porque só quer um passe MBTA com desconto.
 E eles vão dizer, escute, amigo, eu só quero o passe.
 Aqui estão meus 30 dólares.
 Vou me preocupar em chegar à escola.
 Nesse ponto, não acho que estejamos violando a política.
 Acho que encontramos um aluno que decidiu que quer fazer o MBTA para a escola, chegando a tempo ou não.
 Novamente, acho que a intenção é muito, muito clara.
 E acho que faremos tudo o que pudermos para executá-lo.
 Teremos de manter um diálogo aberto com a Comissão se nos encontrarmos numa situação em que, quer do ponto de vista orçamental, quer simplesmente a nível da implementação, isso simplesmente não seja possível.
 Mas certamente entendo a intenção.
 E como eu disse, faremos o nosso melhor para agir de forma consistente com isso.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4879.947s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Então, como você deseja que a resolução seja redigida?
 Deputado Graham e Sr. Murphy, para que possamos ter uma ideia do que veremos antes de 1º de junho, e não de 1º de agosto.
 Achei que estava claro.
 Bem, você mencionou a data de 1º de agosto, e eu só quero saber o que estou apoiando e o que será fornecido e quando.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4905.178s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Portanto, o orçamento incluirá a suposição de que não custa dinheiro ir à escola.
 E o plano e estratégia de transportes revistos não é algo que possa razoavelmente ser feito antes que isso aconteça.
 Então esse é o tempo que levaria até 1º de agosto.
 Quanto aos detalhes, será que os passes MBTA são gratuitos para todos ou é a estratégia de que existe um ônibus amarelo e é a estratégia que estamos mudando?
 num raio de uma a duas milhas, tudo isso obviamente tem implicações orçamentárias, assim como literalmente tudo o que acontece no distrito depois que o orçamento é aprovado.
 Mas o orçamento deve reflectir uma capacidade de custos que nos permita não exigir que os alunos paguem para ir à escola.
 Está claro, Sr. Murphy?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4960.204s">[David Murphy]</a>: Sim, quero dizer, acho que a única ressalva, não estou realmente tentando ser exigente com isso, é que não acho que agora exigimos que alguém pague para ir à escola.
 Na verdade, alguns alunos estão pegando o ônibus MBTA e, em teoria, nossa falta de capacidade do ônibus amarelo na escola exige isso com base em onde moram, na situação familiar ou em qualquer outra coisa.
 E assim, na prática, eles pagam para ir à escola, mas não é como se a política distrital dissesse que não deixamos você entrar, a menos que você apareça em um ônibus da MBTA pelo qual você paga.
 Então, acho que gostaríamos de coletar dados sobre a população atual de estudantes, esperançosamente também olhar para um período de anos, ver quantos passes MBTA estamos vendendo e assumir que isso é um limite em termos do que teríamos que fornecer.
 E então acho que veremos se reduzimos isso do ponto de vista de custos, adicionando capacidade de ônibus amarelos.
 E então eu acho que enquanto vendemos os passes MBTA, porque como discutimos anteriormente, não queremos impedir que nossos alunos obtenham os passes com desconto.
 Então acho que temos que coletar dados sobre o que são os passes.
 Os passes são usados com base na preferência ou são adquiridos mais com base na preferência ou falta de
 outras maneiras de chegar à escola.
 Então acho que a intenção é muito clara.
 Como eu disse, vamos executá-lo adequadamente e só teremos que voltar se encontrarmos um obstáculo logístico ou se se tornar algo que pareça impossível.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5068.707s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: Sobre esta moção, obrigado.
 Só para esclarecer,
 perspectiva, eu acho que gostaria apenas de esclarecer se existe tal coisa, mas o problema há muito tempo é que temos alunos que pagam para administrar a escola, muitos dos quais são economicamente desfavorecidos, e que são
 potencialmente dentro de um raio de duas milhas, ou pelo menos dentro de um raio de duas milhas.
 E se você pensar até mesmo no limite do raio de três quilômetros, o que seria, digamos, por exemplo, estudantes nas proximidades de McGlynn, nas proximidades da McGlynn High School, caminhando para a escola ou para obtê-la porque não tinham dinheiro para isso ou tendo que escolher, você sabe, pagar US$ 30 por mês pelo passe reduzido que poderia impactar muito suas famílias.
 Eu acho que é só
 um valor ético é uma declaração, nosso orçamento reflete quais são nossos valores e acho que fiquei surpreso que esse tenha sido o caso na história, mesmo sentado no comitê escolar do outro lado do pódio pelo qual os alunos tiveram que pagar.
 transporte para a escola e principalmente por ter sido um estudante que não teria condições de fazer isso, aí você pensa em quais são as taxas de absenteísmo, quais são as taxas de fome, o que você sabe, são tantos, são tantos impactos, então essa moção saberia que eu preferiria que fossem os passes da MBTA, mas eu deixaria que o comitê de finanças fizesse isso e nos desse uma

 Eu deveria ter feito essa pergunta antes de ela ser movida, mas quero apenas fazer mais uma pergunta esclarecedora.
 Sim, existe a moção que prevê o raio de três quilômetros no nível secundário, porque pela política existente, esses alunos não receberiam ônibus amarelo, mesmo que tivéssemos descarregado os ônibus amarelos.
 Mas eu, eu não sei, não sei o que um passe MBTA faria, mas se um aluno mora a menos de 400 metros da escola, a expectativa é que ainda vamos garantir que haja transporte gratuito para esse aluno, mesmo que
 Algo como a política contempla caminhar até a escola?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5248.902s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Não, quero dizer, se a lei prevê que os alunos vão a pé para a escola, estou bem se continuar a ser essa prática.
 Não estou pedindo que mordamos pessoalmente aquele pedaço de maçã agora.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5273.365s">[David Murphy]</a>: Se você estiver, se estiver a mais de três quilômetros da escola e em ambos os lados, você sabe, fora do raio da escola, e um está começando a pegar um ônibus amarelo grátis, e outro está sendo informado de que eles têm que pagar US $ 30 por mês por um passe MBTA.
 Isso é ultrajante.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5288.911s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Sim.</p>

 Para ser claro, ninguém com mais de 6 anos tem direito a transporte.

 Isso faz sentido e podemos fazê-lo.
 Mas enquanto estivermos, a sua resposta diz-me que todos concordamos sobre o que é a desigualdade, é isso que procuramos abordar.

 Penso que o meu problema específico era que os estudantes economicamente desfavorecidos tinham de pagar
 transporte para a escola.
 E então, seja dentro do raio de três quilômetros ou, você sabe, acho que o raio de três quilômetros é, você sabe, ou um raio de um quilômetro ou o que quer que estejamos oferecendo.
 Eu sei que antigamente os professores pagavam para que os alunos tivessem acesso ao MBTA.
 passes de transporte.
 E então, indo ao seu ponto, Sr. Murphy, e isso é algo que pode estar sujeito a uma consideração mais aprofundada, não necessariamente para esta moção ou acréscimo específico, você sabe que as moções foram aprovadas, mas, no que diz respeito ao seu ponto, isso permite que passes MBTA permitam acessibilidade na cidade, eles podem permitir salas de aula na cidade, podem permitir oportunidades de emprego,
 pode permitir transporte para a escola.
 E o subconjunto mais importante que me preocupa: você vai fazer uma pergunta?
 Sim.
 Estaremos nos concentrando nas pessoas economicamente desfavorecidas nesta consideração?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5405.854s">[David Murphy]</a>: Bem, acho que a moção... acho que pertence a todos.
 Sim, acho que são todos eles.
 Sim, é mais abrangente do que os economicamente desfavorecidos, mas não inclui estudantes num raio de três quilómetros.
 Isso nos dá um ponto de dados para começar e
 semelhante ao que o Dr. Grisham estava dizendo anteriormente sobre o uso de GPS para identificar a partir de uma perspectiva de gráficos de dados, você sabe, podemos dizer, ok, esta é a nossa população de estudantes que precisamos garantir que eles cheguem à escola de graça.
 E pode ser que, à semelhança do que aparentemente fazemos antes do Dia do Trabalho, se simplesmente colocarmos um autocarro na sala, possamos acomodar uma grande parte desses estudantes.
 E se conseguirmos fazer isso, penso que poderá ser uma directiva bastante fácil de cumprir.
 Se olharmos e dissermos, bom, aquele ônibus que usávamos antes do Dia do Trabalho atende apenas 15% dos alunos.
 E para atender as diversas áreas da comunidade, precisamos de seis novos ônibus.
 Então talvez tenhamos que voltar atrás e dizer que teremos que reconstruir isso de outra maneira, porque não temos uma maneira sustentável de fazer isso agora.
 E então, nesse ponto, talvez tenhamos que restringir quem estamos focando em desvantagem econômica, porque a Sra.
 McLaughlin estava dizendo.
 Novamente, não sei exatamente como isso vai acabar, mas acho que temos uma direção clara e estamos felizes em seguir em frente.</p>

 Por que é que?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5527.325s">[David Murphy]</a>: Porque no comitê você se lembrará de que o que foi defendido para o EF21 foi essencialmente uma capacidade de dois assentos.
 O que procuramos fazer foi, primeiro, com a atribuição do Capítulo 70, adicionarmos o cargo de controlador.
 Essa é a Sra.
 Kingdon, que tem sido fundamental para fazê-lo parecer menos estúpido do que normalmente seria, semana após semana.
 Também traz habilidades e experiência em contabilidade que não foram abordadas na faculdade de direito, pelas quais sou grato.
 Além disso,
 Reaproveitamos um cargo de assistente executivo que evoluiu para uma função de coordenador de subsídios e o reposicionamos no escritório financeiro como coordenador de subsídios.
 E é por isso que expandimos nossa capacidade até esse ponto.
 Você verá que está, bem, em suas tabelas salariais, o assistente executivo, o substituto para o cargo de assistente executivo, e só, sinto muito, para encerrar isso,
 Tudo isso foi feito durante o EF21.
 O orçamento neutro para o coordenador de subvenções veio novamente através da alocação do capítulo 70 que foi feita em agosto.
 Isso expandiu a nossa capacidade e nos posicionou melhor para servir o distrito.
 A única prioridade que permanece na narrativa orçamental de finanças e operações reside nas tabelas salariais.
 que abrangem todo o distrito, com os quais você deve falar antes de nós, apenas para deixar claro qual é a tabela salarial em todo o distrito, aquele cargo de assistente executivo que atualmente apoia dois dos superintendentes assistentes quando reabastecido apoiará todos os três superintendentes assistentes e, portanto, irá adicionar capacidade ao escritório de finanças também nesse aspecto.
 Então, com efeito, teremos,
 Novamente, não pretendemos inflacionar o departamento financeiro.
 Você me ouviu dizer ontem à noite que as prioridades orçamentárias desenvolvidas como parte do Orçamento Aplicado 22 são orientadas por aquilo que terá o apoio mais direto aos estudantes.
 E posso certamente compreender como é que aqueles que trabalham nas comunidades escolares sugeririam que o gabinete de finanças e operações não é necessariamente o mais próximo das crianças.
 Mas para podermos servir bem o distrito e beneficiar as crianças, precisamos de ter o pessoal certo.
 Ao adicionar o cargo de coordenador de bolsas, o cargo de controlador e uma parte do cargo de assistente executivo, acreditamos que estaremos mais bem posicionados para fazê-lo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5687.179s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Obrigado por isso.
 E depois o meu comentário final é simplesmente dizer que não sou a favor de gastar
 fundos de capital para projetos de reabilitação de banheiros ou do Teatro Karen ou da entrada até que haja um plano diretor real que atenda às necessidades de longo prazo da escola secundária.
 É muito dinheiro.
 É cerca de um quarto de milhão de dólares no total, e não é inconsequente quando falamos,
 tipo 10 profissionais do poder, muitos, muitos professores, pessoal que não podemos incluir no orçamento.
 Existem muitas outras prioridades além dos gastos sem um plano claro para a construção.
 Já disse isso antes, mas a prioridade de ter um plano claro para esse edifício é de vital importância.
 E até que isso aconteça, não posso apoiar o gasto de dólares comunitários de uma forma que nos classifique ou nos amarre as mãos quando se trata das maiores necessidades daquele edifício, que ainda não foram avaliadas.
 Obrigado.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5768.462s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Até esse ponto, se você pudesse apontar que os mais de 800.000 e os 100.000 das caldeiras e dos laboratórios de ciências têm que ir para projetos de capital.
 Então eu acho que são muitos.
 E o ensino médio precisa de muita atenção e de um comitê de visão, e o trabalho que faríamos levaria anos.
 Então, quero dizer, discordo respeitosamente.
 Eu queria ressaltar isso.
 Membro McLaughlin.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5796.765s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: Obrigado.
 Eu tenho algumas perguntas.
 Acho que vou começar com isso, já que esse foi o último tópico da conversa.
 Acho que gostaria que a próxima agenda incluísse o comitê de visão do MHS para que possamos entender qual é a sua situação quando consideramos gastar dinheiro.
 Só não quero desperdiçar dinheiro bom atrás de dinheiro ruim.
 Tem havido muita discussão sobre o ensino médio e não convocamos o comitê de visão.
 Gostaria que isso fosse incluído na próxima agenda, por favor.
 E então, voltando ao assunto dos transportes, o presidente iria perguntar ao Sr. Murphy o que ele quis dizer com vincular oportunidades programáticas às suas aquisições?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5840.763s">[David Murphy]</a>: Isso está em um dos documentos?
 Adquirindo o que é apenas um pouco mais de contexto.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5847.308s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: Não sei, não entendi do que você estava falando.
 Você estava falando sobre transporte e me desculpe, mas citei o que você estava dizendo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5854.951s">[David Murphy]</a>: Desculpe, acho que estávamos falando sobre passes MBTA.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5857.612s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: Sim.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5858.012s">[David Murphy]</a>: E o que eu estava dizendo, e acho que você fez um comentário semelhante, Sra.
 McLaughlin, que os passes MBTA são um bom investimento para os alunos frequentarem a escola.
 São um ótimo investimento se houver vínculo entre a aquisição de passes MBTA.
 Oportunidades programáticas e instrucionais que colocam os alunos na comunidade e oferecem oportunidades de aprendizagem experiencial.
 E como não sei, e certamente há muitos professores e o CCR, o CCSR é um ótimo exemplo disso, mas há muitas oportunidades de ensino no ensino médio que se infiltram na comunidade e no tipo de mundo educacional em geral, além dos muros da sala de aula.
 Mas se quisermos aumentar o nosso investimento
 e investir em passes MBTA, então parece-me que poderíamos maximizar esse investimento se fizermos isso e pensarmos também através de uma lente instrucional, e tentarmos expandir nossas oportunidades de aprendizagem experiencial, o que eu acho que na minha opinião é pelo menos um bem em si, mas é ampliado quando também fornecemos esse tipo de recurso para torná-lo mais acessível aos alunos.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5931.149s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: Obrigado.
 Achei que era isso que você quis dizer e queria esclarecimentos porque estou imaginando, por exemplo, estudantes do ensino profissional se transportando para o local, voluntários do CCSR e todo esse tipo de coisa.
 Portanto, seria interessante saber quais são as oportunidades programáticas à medida que consideramos esta análise de custos para estas diferentes opções.
 E então eu sei que não só temos ônibus orientais, mas também temos nossos fornecedores de transporte.
 Temos vários fornecedores de transporte e tem havido vários problemas entre eles.
 Pessoalmente, tivemos alguns problemas com fornecedores de transporte e sei que é difícil manter ou reter pessoal.
 especialmente nas atuais circunstâncias.
 Mas estou me perguntando sobre uma oportunidade centralizada ou quase como uma solução C-click, você sabe, uma espécie de opção ou, você sabe, uma linha de reclamação ou algo onde possamos coletar dados sobre o que realmente está acontecendo na comunidade em relação ao nosso transporte, porque estamos pagando muito dinheiro aos nossos fornecedores, e sinto que não há responsabilidade perante os fornecedores.
 Não há qualquer consistência em torno do que os fornecedores oferecem, e mesmo em alguns dos contratos que vi.
 Os pais chegam em casa com cartas dizendo que se você perder o ônibus de manhã, não vão buscá-lo à tarde, o que é uma violação total, certo?
 Você não pode fazer isso.
 Mas isto é para transporte de educação especial, por exemplo.
 Mas esse foi um cartão que vimos especificamente.
 Então é isso que estou dizendo.
 Tem de haver alguma coerência em torno dos contratos, dos orçamentos, mas também do tipo de processo de sinistros.
 porque sim
 um administrador ouve reclamações sobre uma seção e outro ouve outra, como quem está centralizando essas reclamações para que nós, como comitê escolar, entendamos quais são as ofertas desses fornecedores e se são razoáveis.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6050.083s">[David Murphy]</a>: Não, agradeço por ter mencionado isso, Sra.
 McLaughlin e eu, como dissemos no início da apresentação, esta é uma das principais razões pelas quais queríamos nos reorganizar para ter uma pessoa-chave comprometida com a família.
 E isso não quer dizer que, uma vez que tenhamos um diretor de envolvimento familiar, você sabe, nunca haverá reclamações ou nunca haverá reclamações que não tenham a resposta imediata e substantiva que preferiríamos, porque a natureza de uma grande organização é que às vezes algo vai acontecer e só descobrimos de fato algum tempo depois.
 E às vezes ouviremos sobre isso, mas haverá um conflito
 Você sabe, uma história sobre o que realmente aconteceu.
 Portanto, não quero sugerir que através dessa reorganização desses escritórios, de alguma forma, nunca haverá problemas adicionais, porque, você sabe, essa é a realidade.
 Contudo, ao mesmo tempo, prevemos que o Gabinete de Envolvimento Familiar irá, em muitos aspectos, actuar como um facilitador central entre os gabinetes que têm contacto mais directo e frequente.
 com as famílias, e esses são alguns dos programas de cuidados antes e depois da escola, o processo de inscrição quando você entra pela primeira vez na comunidade escolar, os serviços de saúde, onde a comunicação com as famílias muitas vezes depende literalmente da vida, e a educação especial certamente, e o transporte é uma grande parte disso, porque por mais que interajamos com as famílias e os pais no ambiente instrucional,
 Algumas dessas questões logísticas operacionais básicas são aquilo para que as famílias mais dependem do distrito, e tendo esses escritórios como os raios de uma roda, por assim dizer, penso que ajudará do ponto de vista da comunicação e garantirá que os administradores que precisam de ser informados sobre algumas destas questões sejam rapidamente informados.
 Portanto, o único ponto em que discordo dos seus comentários, Deputado McLaughlin,
 é a sugestão de que não haveria responsabilidade para nenhum fornecedor.
 E a responsabilização pode ocorrer de diversas maneiras e, às vezes, em vários prazos.
 Mas direi que enquanto a administração e certamente a Sra.
 O escritório de Bowen, em particular, está ciente destas questões, nós as levamos muito a sério e respondemos a elas.
 E se houver algum caso de que os pais ou responsáveis ​​tenham conhecimento, em que um prestador de cuidados não tenha cumprido as suas responsabilidades para com os alunos ou famílias do distrito, isso é algo que queremos saber imediatamente.
 E certamente temos o nosso compromisso de que haverá uma resposta robusta em todos os momentos, porque certamente a situação que você descreveu, você sabe, a evacuação é completamente inaceitável e não é algo que toleraríamos.
 por nossa própria equipe ou por quaisquer fornecedores aos quais estejamos associados.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6238.19s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: Obrigado.
 E se me permite, Prefeito, para ser claro, o Diretor de Serviços Estudantis sempre foi incrivelmente receptivo, mas eu também sempre fui uma roda barulhenta.
 E penso nas pessoas que não o fazem e em como elas respondem e como podem mostrar que o transporte está funcionando.
 E, francamente, acho que se trata de coleta de dados.
 e crianças chegando atrasadas à escola e algo assim.
 Mas, novamente, acho importante olhar para nossos fornecedores.
 E, por último, gostaria apenas de elogiar mais uma vez a orientação do superintendente no sentido de um maior desenvolvimento profissional e de um desenvolvimento profissional direccionado, tanto em torno de preconceitos implícitos como de aprendizagem socioemocional.
 E ouvi da equipe e dos membros da comunidade dois pontos sobre o desenvolvimento profissional que gostaria de destacar.
 e um é aquele
 Acho que alguns funcionários especializados não acham necessariamente que haja desenvolvimento profissional específico para, você sabe, licenças ou necessidades muito específicas, então eu queria apresentar isso e também
 Você sabe, apenas a preocupação em garantir a participação e o desenvolvimento profissional dos paraprofissionais e isso está relacionado aos paraprofissionais e certamente parece que a parte do aprendizado socioemocional fará parte disso, mas quero ter certeza disso e sei que no passado acho que muitas vezes os paraprofissionais foram aonde os professores vão.
 Eles são professores associados, pelo que eu entendo, você também conhece o raciocínio em torno disso.
 Mas acho que também seria bom poder permitir que as pessoas tivessem alguma flexibilidade e opções de desenvolvimento de carreira.
 Então, essas não são coisas para as quais espero uma resposta esta noite, mas só queria mencioná-las para que vocês fiquem cientes.
 Obrigado.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6347.04s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Obrigado.
 Obrigado, membros.
 Então o membro Kreatz e depois o membro Van der Kloot.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6353.346s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: Obrigado, prefeito.
 Sei que já aprovamos a resolução sobre o plano de transporte.
 Eu tive que caminhar 1,8 km até o ponto de ônibus todos os dias enquanto crescia.
 E se eu perdesse o ônibus, teria que caminhar quatro horas e 29 minutos para chegar à escola.
 Obviamente é um pouco maior que Medford.
 Então foram 13 milhas.
 Mas o que quero dizer é a minha experiência de pegar o ônibus ou não ir à escola,
 Hum, é que se você olhasse para minhas ausências, hum, você sabe, Massachusetts, eu provavelmente teria DCF em minha casa, francamente.
 Hum, então eu só espero que quando fizermos o plano, hum, e estivermos falando de duas milhas versus uma milha, hum, eu acho que isso se relaciona um pouco com os níveis de pessoal do Sr.
 Hum, quero conhecer nossos filhos que estão num raio de três quilômetros.
 Eles chegam atrasados ​​ou faltam mais do que crianças fora do raio de três quilômetros.
 E eu realmente não acho que você tenha capacidade de passar um ano de festas e um ano de faltas e calcular a distância da escola e se vão de ônibus ou algo assim, parece muito trabalhoso.
 Mas essa é uma decisão política que estamos a tomar sem ter qualquer ideia do impacto sobre
 resultados educacionais porque, você sabe, se sempre voltarmos a isso, se você não estiver na escola, certamente não estará aprendendo.
 Então, você sabe, minha própria experiência de você chegar ao ponto de ônibus ou não ir à escola, isso certamente acontece em Medford também.
 Então, quando falamos de uma milha versus duas milhas, acho que também precisamos reconhecer que não há apenas um impacto financeiro.
 Há um impacto em todas as pontuações.
 A superintendente gosta muito da pontuação MCAS dela, sabe, são métricas, goste ela do MCAS ou não, são métricas e isso é importante.
 Mas esta é uma política específica que terá impacto nas métricas.
 E não, quero dizer, não, não estou pedindo um relatório, mas sei por experiência própria que é absolutamente um fato.
 Se você perder o ônibus, você não vai para a escola.
 E claro, eu não conseguiria ir a pé para a escola se perdesse o ônibus e não tivesse transporte, mas
 Tenho certeza de que há muitas crianças que, se perderam o ônibus, estão ferradas.
 Mas para todas as crianças naquele raio de três quilômetros não há ônibus.
 Então, quando há uma chuva forte, desagradável e fria, que costumávamos ter antes do aquecimento global fazer com que tudo atingisse 70 graus, naqueles dias, se você andar de ônibus,
 diferente do que se você não estivesse pegando o ônibus e esperasse caminhar pelo menos 40 minutos para chegar à escola.
 Então eu não tenho nenhuma pergunta.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6537.591s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Eu fico tipo... Obrigado, membros.
 Obrigado.

 Membro Kreatz, se você puder ativar meu som, por favor.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6554.746s">[Kathy Kreatz]</a>: Ah, ok, aqui vamos nós.
 Sim, então, em relação à moção que fizemos esta noite, o Sr. Murphy nos dará um relatório que descreva quais seriam os vários custos, por exemplo, se usaremos ônibus amarelos para todos os estudantes do distrito ou se consideraremos a compra de passes de ônibus MBTA para todos os estudantes?
 Será esta uma proposta que estará pronta para ser analisada na altura do orçamento, para que possamos ver como se enquadra no orçamento?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6595.799s">[David Murphy]</a>: Acho que vamos tentar criar um plano que não inclua alunos fora de um raio de três quilômetros da escola secundária, dependendo de passes MBTA que eles devem comprar.
 Como vamos conseguir isso, acho que precisaremos de um pouco de tempo para descobrir, mas só estou dizendo, não deveria especular sobre isso, mas vou apenas dizer o que meu instinto me diz é que terá que ser um plano multifacetado onde adicionaremos capacidade de ônibus amarelo.
 Temos um número X de passes MBTA para os quais o distrito está absorvendo o custo e potencialmente explorando
 outras associações para ajudar a custear esse custo geral e também considerar quais dados podemos coletar para determinar a base para a aquisição do MBTA pelos alunos.
 Então, acho que para fazer isso teremos que examinar cada uma dessas alavancas.
 E acho que, pelo que entendi, acho que se soubermos antes de 1º de agosto que
 Isto não é algo que possamos fazer financeiramente ou logisticamente, informaremos a comissão.
 E eu, o que imagino, é informar o comitê, e não apenas levantar as mãos e dizer, desculpe, não podemos fazer isso.
 Acho que o que diríamos é, você sabe, antes de termos
 Esses são os obstáculos para liberar o barco cheio de estudantes que compram os passes.
 E então, naquele momento, para a Sra.
 McLaughlin, então poderíamos analisar como potencialmente visamos estudantes de circunstâncias economicamente desfavorecidas.
 Então eu acho que é multifacetado, mas como eu disse, a direção é clara e teremos que avançar nessa direção e faremos tudo o que pudermos para torná-la realidade.</p>

 Inicialmente, logo após a eleição e as preocupações com a composição dos comitês, a pandemia interveio.
 É vital que determinemos onde queremos chegar com isto.
 Vamos eleger um comitê completamente novo?
 Houve pessoas que manifestaram interesse.
 Neste momento, precisamos de estabelecer um comité porque compreendo as preocupações da Jenny.
 E também quero ter certeza de que o prédio seja habitável para as crianças que lá estão.
 Então eu acho que há um
 Penso que existe um meio-termo entre não fazer nada e fazer algumas das melhorias necessárias para manter o edifício num estado satisfatório.
 formulário como os alunos o usam atualmente.
 Mas a chave para isso, mais do que tudo, é que temos de determinar o que será o comité de visão, o que lhes pediremos e qual será o cronograma que imaginamos.
 Talvez não seja o momento de começar no final de junho.
 Eu entendo.
 Mas devemos estar preparados para nos concentrarmos no início de setembro e não esperar que passe mais um ano letivo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6835.327s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Vamos supor a mesma coisa, vamos começar no outono, onde temos outras coisas, o orçamento, a Escola Columbus, a volta das crianças.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6870.91s">[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>: Queria apenas dizer que quero lembrar à comissão que acredito que foi em dezembro de 2019, quando fui perante o conselho, que foram atribuídos os 800.000 para as casas de banho.
 e eu só quero
 Digo que apoio fortemente a renovação de algumas das casas de banho do complexo do ensino secundário porque elas precisam desesperadamente de ser melhoradas e renovadas.
 E concordo que precisamos trabalhar num plano mais abrangente, mas os banheiros mais modernos de todo o complexo ficam na ala científica.
 E isso é para todo o complexo que possui banheiros realmente modernos.
 Portanto, nem todos os alunos estão localizados naquela seção do prédio.
 Então espero que parte desse dinheiro que foi alocado em 2019 e por causa da pandemia e tudo o que realmente precisamos para avançar pelo menos com a renovação e melhoria de alguns dos
 algumas dessas instalações de banheiro.
 Acho que isso é de vital importância.
 E, você sabe, estou apenas pensando nas necessidades dos alunos e dizendo que quero que eles possam ter banheiros atualizados que funcionem.
 Por isso, queria apenas lembrar à comissão o compromisso que foi assumido quando nos foi dado o dinheiro.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6969.628s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Obrigado, Dr. Edouard-Vincent.
 Membro Graham e depois membro Kreatz.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6974.25s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Eu só queria dizer que concordo com o membro Van der Kloot.
 Na verdade, não se trata de nos opormos a nenhum desses projectos, e talvez todos façam sentido, mas a falta de informação neste momento está a colocar-nos numa posição em que poderíamos estar a tomar decisões para gastar quantias substanciais de dinheiro da cidade de uma forma frívola ou de uma forma que torna tudo mais complicado.
 fazer o que precisa ser feito quando realmente conversamos com especialistas sobre quais são as necessidades do edifício.
 Portanto, todos com quem você conversa têm uma opinião sobre o que deveria acontecer com a Medford High School, e agradeço a contribuição de todos, mas haverá um horário e local para consultarmos especialistas e descrevermos
 o que os especialistas acreditam que deveria acontecer com o edifício e isso não foi feito até agora.
 Portanto, para mim, não me oponho a nenhuma destas despesas em si, mas oponho-me a que decidamos que estas despesas são prudentes ou uma boa utilização do dinheiro dos contribuintes sem que os especialistas nos digam isso.
 na verdade, esse é o caso.
 Portanto, concordo que devemos avançar e penso que o devemos fazer com uma mente aberta.
 Lembro-me muito claramente de quando caminhávamos pelo prédio com o comitê de visão ou com o comitê escolar, pouco antes da pandemia, e ouvíamos pessoas que faziam parte do comitê.
 enquanto eles conversavam e discutiam no corredor sobre o que poderíamos ou não considerar para o ensino médio por causa da ala de ciências ou por causa disso e daquilo.
 E eu encorajaria todos nós a expressarmos nossas opiniões.
 de lado e realmente elaborar um plano que nos permita entender quais são as necessidades do edifício para que possamos avançar rapidamente e começar a alcançar alguns desses objetivos.
 E a última coisa que direi é que embora falássemos sobre o plano de capital, não elaboramos um plano de capital.
 Portanto, com esses US$ 800 mil, não tenho a impressão de que haja escassez de projetos, incluindo vários telhados em fim de vida.
 como chegar aqui muito rapidamente e que o plano de capital abrangente não levou em conta.
 Portanto, penso que temos muito trabalho a fazer no nosso plano de capital para que possamos ser bons parceiros com o resto do governo municipal e ajudar a garantir que as necessidades do nosso distrito sejam satisfeitas e que não nos deparemos com uma situação em que não consigamos manter as coisas.
 e nos encontramos em outra situação semelhante à de uma pandemia, em que há muito trabalho a ser feito para que os edifícios voltem aos padrões.
 Portanto, sou um forte defensor de priorizarmos significativamente esse plano de capital.
 Não sou engenheiro estrutural.
 Não creio que alguém neste comitê esteja.
 Por isso, gostaria que priorizássemos esse tipo de experiência quando falamos de planos para gastar uma quantia significativa do dinheiro dos contribuintes, mas também,
 Não creio que teremos que esperar anos e anos e anos para obter essa informação.
 Acho que os alunos que estão indo para lá agora são muito importantes e, para ser justo com eles, e realmente, francamente, todos os alunos que estão atualmente nas Escolas Públicas de Medford, agora é a hora de avançar nesta prioridade.
 meus filhos provavelmente não se formariam em uma escola que parecesse diferente da atual.
 Portanto, se tivermos sorte, os alunos do primeiro ano e do jardim de infância poderão ter a oportunidade de fazer algo diferente, mas apenas se agirmos.
 Então cabe a nós fazer isso.
