    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=208.272s">[David Murphy]</a>:  Thank you, Superintendent, Mayor, members of the school committee.
 It's a pleasure to be with you again this evening.
 for our fifth committee of the whole meeting focused on the FY22 budget.
 As the superintendent mentioned, tonight we'll be focused on elements of the central office, specifically the offices that are under both the superintendent and my own supervision.
 As we go through the beginning of the program, as we have each time, we'll be looking at the org chart and talking specifically about the offices whose budgets are
 are here in light of the fact that these are the offices that myself and the superintendent work most closely with.
 While Dr. Kuching, Ms.
 Galussi, Ms.
 Bowen are here, with the exception of Director McLaughlin, we will be really the only presenters and speakers tonight.
 But certainly we'll be eager to answer any questions that you have, both with respect to the offices that we are focusing on tonight and anything else that we've covered
 over the course of the last several weeks.
 And as I mentioned in my message to the committee, both last night and a few minutes ago, we will be having a budget update on the school committee agenda this coming Monday, May 24th.
 And we'll certainly be picking up questions and comments at that point, incorporating and taking in your feedback.
 And that will go into the development of the recommendations that come before you.
 prior to your June 1st statutory hearing.
 So with that, I will start, as we always do, with the timeline for our budget process, beginning with the development of the district's strategic goals and priorities, leading to a series of, some administrators might say, seemingly endless administrative meetings internally, in which we vet various proposals and comments, questions, and suggestions
 principles and evening, but have not been following along for each of the various budget presentations, both at regular school committee meetings, budget subcommittee and the committee of the whole meetings.
 This is where we are right now leading up to that June 1st public hearing in which members of the community will be invited to speak either for or against, or a favorite for those who follow municipal presentations, those wishing to speak neither for nor against.
 the budget in part or in whole.
 And again, that will take place on June 1st, but there will be a budget update on Monday, an opportunity to comment and engage in further discussion.
 We've used the org chart in each of these presentations, just as by way of showing folks, perhaps outside of the Medford Public Schools community,
 which area of the organization we're focused on in this particular meeting.
 So this is the overall org chart showing all the various offices and departments reporting up to the superintendent.
 And then these are the areas that we'll be discussing tonight.
 So you can see it's primarily the areas in my own portfolio, as well as those reporting directly to the superintendent.
 And you see the curvy arrow there on the right of the screen.
 which is indicating a reorganization of sorts that we'll be proposing as part of the FY22 budget, and that's something I'll be going into greater detail about shortly.
 So as we've discussed in each of the budget presentations, the funding for the Metro Public Schools and the funding generally for school districts across Massachusetts comes from various sources.
 What we often refer to as the Chapter 70 allocation, which is the
 The state contribution under state law coming out of ed reform law of 1993 and the funding that each school community and district are entitled to.
 The local contribution, which is the revenue generated from at the local level that is air marked for the for the school department, which in Medford is a very sizable portion of that of the overall
 operating budget.
 And then the sort of extenuating circumstances under which we're currently operating mean we have a significant influx of federal funding coming in as a result of the COVID-related legislation that has come in.
 And that is coupled with the sort of standing external funds that come in on a year-in and year-out basis, particularly in the area of special education, which we discussed at length at the May 6th Committee of the Whole when we heard from the Office of Pupil Services.
 We've said that throughout the FY22 budget, we've asked those contributing to the development of this budget, meaning our department heads and our principals, to focus essentially on three primary buckets of areas in which we're asking them what are their budgetary priorities, what are their needs, what are their challenges.
 First is personnel and staffing.
 And the committee certainly said before that when we're talking about school budgets, we're almost always talking about people.
 We're an organization made up of people, educating people, hoping to make them better people and people who are positioned to do well in their post-secondary lives.
 But that is always going to be the largest chunk of our budget because, you know, as we say sometimes in school finance, we're not focused on widgets.
 We're focused on people in a community, and that's always going to be the largest chunk.
 Materials and infrastructure, particularly under the challenging conditions under which we're operating, are always going to represent
 another, albeit smaller, aspect of the budget.
 And training and professional development, which everything is, we are looking at everything through a post-COVID context, but for training and professional development, when we think about the ways in which some of the inequities, both within public education and society at large, have come into sharper relief as a result of the experience that we've all lived through, we are thinking very much in that context when we talk about
 what are our professional development and training priorities, and what is it that we're looking to invest in.
 And particularly when we're talking about the superintendent's priorities, while much of what we're planning will be supported by external funding, given that the budget development process is the opportunity to really look at the organization as a whole, see how we're structured, how we're organized, what it is that we're pursuing, what are our discrete challenges, what are our long-term overarching challenges,
 This really is an opportunity to sort of pull the veil back on all of the Medford Public Schools.
 And my hope would be that throughout these committee of the whole presentations, as we've heard from the various directors and school leaders, my hope would be that both for the school committee and the members of the community who are either watching this in real time or perhaps watching it subsequent to the presentations, you'll see the effort toward transparency that we have employed to try to demonstrate for the community exactly what it is that we're doing.
 And I hope also
 the rationale behind these priorities.
 And this slide talks a little bit about that rationale in that these are the questions that were posed that led to the development of these priorities and that we're thinking about what are the targeted and intensive interventions that we can invest in to help reduce or eliminate the learning or opportunity gaps that have either been caused by or exacerbated by the disruption to instruction that our students have faced as a result of
 the COVID-19 pandemic.
 And so there will come a time when our budgetary priorities and our goals are not informed fully by this experience and the disruption that our students have lived through.
 At least I certainly hope that's the case.
 One of the sort of constant refrains that we go back to is we're looking to make investments that will ensure our students' academic careers are not defined by this experience.
 And hopefully if we make these investments and we execute on them wisely, that will be the case.
 But for right now,
 coming out of these, as cliche as it might sound, these unprecedented circumstances, we are looking to see how do we use the funding that's available to us from the local, state, and federal levels to try to put them in the best position possible despite the chaos that we've all lived through.
 So on April 26th, we presented to the school committee the projections that we were looking at based on the preliminary information that we had.
 uh, leading into these budget presentations.
 And we've estimated that, uh, the necessary increase in the budget would be somewhere between 3.4 and $5.8 million.
 Recognizing that there are a significant number of variables that are, uh, essentially not clear while variable one, there are restrictions on federal funding flowing in that are still not particularly clear.
 And I appreciate the mayor's comments to that effect.
 last night, but we're continuing to engage in a very constructive dialogue with our partners in the city government and reaching out to our partners at the state level and elsewhere to try to get clarity on that.
 I think at this point we feel comfortable that the priorities we've developed that we think of as having a strong nexus to the disruption caused by COVID will be essentially eligible expenses.
 It's a question of, from an administrative perspective, exactly how
 we'll go about processing those and exactly how realistic is it to do that.
 So I think we feel good about the priorities that we've identified as our COVID-related or potential ESSER-related priorities, but there's still a lot of clarity that needs to come into view in the coming weeks.
 In addition to that, we know we have fixed costs as every district does on a year-on-year basis.
 These are costs that are related to contractual obligations or
 other situations that have essentially predated the development of this budget, but we know that they're going to lead to an increase in costs.
 Other variables also include the fact that we have upwards of nine collective bargaining agreements that are expiring either at the conclusion of this school year or the conclusion of the summer.
 And so that's certainly a factor that we have to take into account as we work through the development of this budget.
 This is just information related to those external funding, the numbers the committee has seen several times before, so I won't
 belabor it, but we estimate about a $7.6 million ESSER budget over the next several years.
 And so I wouldn't say that we necessarily see that as needing to be expended in equal installments over the three or four year period that we have.
 But I would say that we want to be mindful of the fact that we're going to have additional data that will hopefully point us to more strategic uses of the funding as time goes on.
 So it may be the case that some of the more immediate expenses are in the short term, but the better use of the funding could be in year two or year three.
 And for that reason, we are looking to be, I'm not sure I would use the word conservative, but certainly cautious and cognizant of the implications of using that funding.
 And the fact is, as you've heard me say several times, these are one-time funds and the ESSER funding will not last forever.
 And so we have to be mindful of the uses
 being taking care to not create unnecessary structural deficits, and at the same time, making sure that we're being responsive to the urgent needs of students.
 And so where we strike that equilibrium is a big part of the conversations that we have been having and that we will be having.
 So I'm going to pause for one second before we move on to buildings and grounds and just talk a little bit about what you'll see over the next couple of slides in this, but I'm glad that I flashed to it quickly so that I can tell
 Mr. McLaughlin that he's on next as I continue to babble for another minute or so.
 But the departments that you're seeing starting with buildings, we're going to start with buildings and grounds and then move to the more umbrella offices of the superintendent's office and the office of finance and operations.
 And if you think back to the organizational chart that we saw at the beginning of the presentation, you can see that for both myself and Dr. Edouard-Vincent, there are a lot of priorities and funding and strategic investments
 and proposals that cut across the different departments and offices that you've already heard from.
 And that's a good thing because what we don't want to do is present a budget to you in the form of 25 siloed or overly departmentalized mini organizations.
 We want common themes and common strategic priorities that cut across.
 And so what you'll see in the bullets that we've identified are pieces that are either reflective of those priorities
 or operational pieces that are meant to put us in a position that we'll be able to actually pursue those priorities and do so successfully.
 Similar to the information technology budget proposals that we discussed in last night's committee of the whole, a large portion, arguably all, frankly, of the buildings and grounds priorities, the year maintenance issue,
 uh, that is essentially routine.
 I think routine was the word that we used in the technology presentation.
 That's something that we typically are going to incorporate one way or another into our operating budget.
 Um, something that is a one-time expense and I'm using the term one time in the context of municipal budgeting.
 And so one time could mean every 10 years, every 15 years, every 20 years, but certainly not on an annual basis.
 Um, that's every 20 years, but certainly not on an annual basis.
 That's something that we're going to look up to as a capital expense that we're going to try to keep off the operating budget for purposes of not creating some of those deficits that we've talked about.
 What we do when we have a large influx of federal funding, frankly, similar to how we handled the funding that came in during FY21, and to some extent in FY20 as well, is to try to address some of the most urgent priorities and needs that might in another context be considered a capital expense.
 but in light of the urgency, we're looking to just take what funding is available and make sure that that's addressed.
 That was certainly the case as is reflected in the buildings and grounds budget narrative that was provided to you today with regard to our HVAC repairs that we needed to expedite and accelerate at the beginning of this school year for purposes of getting students and staff back into the physical school buildings.
 And so I expressed my appreciation for Mr. McLaughlin and members of his team who partnered with
 the external experts that we brought in to make that a reality.
 The history as to how we got to the place where so much work was necessary, I think, has been addressed at length in previous meetings.
 But however we got here, we are in a much better position from an air quality perspective because that work was done throughout the course of this year.
 And now we're looking at some of the other heavy infrastructure pieces that may not land in the operating budget for FY22.
 but are critical priorities that need to be addressed in the near term.
 And I'm going to ask Mr. McLaughlin, if he could, to walk us through some of these.
 As we're talking about how these investments need to be made in the coming year or months.
 So John, do you want to take it from there and just start maybe with the generator and transformer electrical issues that we have
 been identified at the high school and at the Andrews and then we'll walk through some of the other pieces.
 From there we'll move on to finance operations in the superintendent's office and then we'll go to questions after that.

 市长、学监、学校委员会成员和管理人员晚上好。

 因此，第一个问题，即变压器放大器的故障，是梅德福高中和安德鲁斯中学的电气项目。
 所以我认为我们已经意识到应急发电机
 梅德福高中的一台应急发电机需要更换。
 我们讨论过。
 我们正在获取 RFP 和定价信息，以尝试完成该项目。还有人留下音频吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=1204.903s">[David Murphy]</a>: 就那么一瞬间他就这么做了，是的。

 我认为我们很好，约翰。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=1214.44s">[John McLaughlin]</a>: 好吧，好吧。
 所以在安德鲁斯学校，这个问题已经从我的常规预算中消除了。
 我们对所有建筑物进行了红外电子扫描，我们的安德鲁斯大楼的断路器出现了问题。
 修好了，就很好了
 我们还有变压器。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=1236.901s">[Kathy Kreatz]</a>: 我听不到麦克劳克林先生的声音。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=1262.233s">[John McLaughlin]</a>: 出色地。
 我不知道。
 我已经激活了接入点。
 我，我，你知道，我为此准备了一段时间。
 不管怎样，所以，呃，是的，所以，呃，断路器或放大器，呃，反式，呃，断路器在安德鲁斯高中被更​​换了。
 所以我们回到了我们需要去的地方。
 嗯，它是，呃，我们对所有电气系统进行，嗯，安全，呃，检查，红外扫描的一部分。
 在高中，通过法学院，对不起。
 因此，我们能够用正常的运营预算来解决这个问题。
 所以我们知道，我们也知道应急发电机，它正准备出去进行 RFP。
 此外，变压器是梅德福高中原装设备。
 所以发生的事情是，是在什么时候，
 几年前我会有多氯联苯。
 所以我们必须去掉 PCB 并在上面涂上另一种油。
 最终发生的情况是橡胶密封件容易脱落。
 所以我正在获取报价。
 我有，今天刚收到，检查变压器。
 并确保我们能够回到我们需要去的地方。
 它的油量很低，但仍在运行，但它肯定是应该优先考虑的事情，因为它还运行着大约三分之一的功率。
 在梅德福高中。
 然后我们将准备好定价信息以继续推进。
 显然，这将是一个带有发电机的夏季项目，只要我们准备好承担该项目即可。
 今年我们进行了一些安全改进。
 我们有一个新的 Raptor 系统。
 当时我安装了所有显示器，并接受了新 Raptor 系统的培训。
 如果你不知道猛禽系统是你进来的地方，你给自己一个许可证，他们会扫描它。
 如果一切顺利，您将收到一个标签，并准备好前往总办公室办理您在我们任何学校需要办理的业务。
 因此，我们希望每三四年完成一次停车场。
 我应该说，通常是整个系统范围内的所有这些。
 停车场又被标记了，它们开始老化了。
 我们想做一些
 梅福德高中的调整，我们将就残疾人停车情况与该学校会面。
 我知道我们在谈论主入口时进行了这样的对话。
 我认为我们想要做的是搬到梅福德高中前面的残疾人专用点，并进入那里的残疾人坡道。
 所以，你知道，让我们回顾一下。
 我和
 Lungo-Koehn 市长上周表示，如果我需要帮助，我们在市政厅有交通部门，他们会非常乐意帮助我们。
 几年前，我们与他们会面，试图做出一些改进，但众所周知，过去的一年并不是我们通常处理的典型年份。
 柯蒂斯塔夫茨锅炉项目，所以去年冬天，锅炉开始泄漏。
 这些都是我们可能会在下周的小组委员会会议上讨论的问题。
 这就是为什么我们订购了一些需要重新安装的部件，即分段部件。
 因此，我们得到了两个部分，他们将更换它们，这应该可以阻止我们预期的泄漏。
 我们将不得不在这方面花费大量资金。
 和暖通空调的改进。
 所以我们知道我们做了很多这样的事情。
 我们目前正在打开空调。
 因此，存在与此相关的问题，某些特定区域需要我们聘请承包商来修复。
 根据法律规定，我们必须在 5 月 15 日之前提供供暖。
 所以这周是我们进行结算的一周。
 不幸的是，本周很热，你知道，这很愚蠢，但这周很热。
 教室里的一些老师感到有点不舒服，但我们正在努力解决。
 我们知道你在那里。
 我们将尽快出去处理所有需要做的事情。
 致电承包商。
 我只是想列出一份我们需要做的事情以及需要做的建筑物的清单。
 嗯，浴室改造项目。
 戴夫和我会见了建筑师。
 嗯，我想我们只是在等待获得许可来查看并制作该项目的 RFP。
 是，我知道这是一个，嗯，
 梅福德高中项目对于改善浴室的许多人来说都是很亲近的。
 我们想要它，我知道。
 市长让我们看看我们能生产多少。
 我想如果我们能得到一个价格，我们就会知道我们在哪里，然后我们就可以从那里走得尽可能远。
 我们仍在等待主入口修复工程。
 看看我们要做什么。
 我们的一个在清洁办公室工作的人是一名瓦工，所以他主动提出出去尝试修复一点墙壁，花岗岩墙。
 所以今天他在那里工作。
 我的意思是，我希望我能让它看起来更好一点，但它仍然会
 什么，是什么，所以你知道我们当然可以在主入口见面，我想我们将在下周和小组委员会讨论并讨论我们希望如何推进这一点。
 这就是为什么我每年都会在预算范围内订购一辆带犁的卡车。
 所以这并没有改变。
 这肯定会对降雪有所帮助，也肯定会对整个地区的其他杂项项目有所帮助。
 如果我们有一辆带犁的卡车。
 所以，你知道，我可以多次帮助 DPW，因为他们行动非常迅速。
 而且，你知道，有时有些区域需要修补，但他们无法返回，因为主要目标是城市周围的道路。
 因此，拥有这样的东西肯定会有助于提高效率。
 由我们处置，接机。
 现在，我想，现在的剧院正在翻修，如果你看到我的预算前报告的话。
 如果我有一个希望看到成果的项目，那就是添加空调、栏杆、更新门以及在剧院进行一些电气工作。
 几年前我得到了一个价格，现在的价格不同了：在剧院的天花板上加装一台空调需要 10 万美元。
 我认为这对社区也有好处。
 也为学校创造收入，也许在某个时候将其添加到我们的资本改进清单中。
 但是，就像我说的，如果我可以选择我想做的高中项目，那将是我的主要项目之一，即改造项目。
 我们一直致力于学校的暖通空调改进项目。
 你知道，在某些时候，也许我们可以从 MSBA 获得帮助，也许我们可以添加空调以及梅福德高中目前没有空调的其他部分，这意味着科学实验室是建筑物中唯一有空调的真正部分。
 服务，你知道，除了我们到处都有的窗式空调。
 所以看不到底部。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=1801.416s">[David Murphy]</a>: 我认为我们已经处于底部。
 出色地。
 是的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=1804.117s">[John McLaughlin]</a>: 因此，我很乐意回答您对正在发生的事情的任何问题。

 这对我有用。
 好吧，谢谢。
 因此，当我们进入中央行政部门的其他部分、主管办公室和我自己的办公室时，
 我们之前提到过，这些大伞下有几个部门。
 建筑物和场地无疑是最大的建筑和场地之一，坦率地说，也是最引人注目的建筑和场地之一。
 这当然就是为什么我们邀请麦克劳克林先生今晚出席并讨论一些细节。
 并快速转到有关高中暖通空调升级相关预算的最后一点。
 坦率地说，这是维护和资本之间区别的一个很好的例子。
 当我们升级学校的一些过滤器以改善空气质量时，我们会产生与过滤器更换相关的额外固定成本。
 使用更高质量过滤器的一部分是我们已经从每两年更换一次系统改为每季度更换一次。
 坦率地说，这对学区来说并不是一笔重大成本，但却是维护成本。
 与锅炉不同的是，
 或者变压器发电机，我们当然不希望每年产生成本的部件之一。
 我们将在未来几年将其纳入预算和资本规划。
 因此，当涉及到主管的预算以及财务和运营办公室的预算时，正如我之前提到的，其中的某些部分与其他一些优先事项和其他一些事项交织在一起。
 已向您推荐的战略投资。
 首先，关于学区总监的预算，请原谅，您已经听到了我们今年整个预算制定过程的重点，即确保我们为员工确定符合后新冠疫情背景下学区需求的专业发展和培训机会。
 嗯，75,000 美元，实际上可能比这个少一点，因为它将分摊到两到三个纳税年度。
 所以它会比那个小一点。
 我们确定专业发展机会，这些机会将针对该地区未来几年继续运营的环境进行密集和敏感。
 因此，我们有特定的社交和情感专业发展。
 以及隐性偏见培训，该培训将于 2021 财年末有效开始，然后推广到随后的财政年度，最初向普通员工和管理人员开放。
 这将是 2021 年夏末的一项强制性计划。
 那么，爱德华-文森特博士或库欣博士是否想多谈谈这种培训的好处以及我们如何看待这种培训。
 这符合我们在整个过程中一直捍卫的总体战略。
 最后一点。
 我预计这些费用的大部分资金将由我们在演示开始时提到的一些外部资金支付。
 因此，特别是 Title II，也可能是 ESSER 资金的一部分，但 Title II 将专门用于支付 2021 财年将产生的费用。
 部分，然后也进入 22 财年。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=2055.034s">[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>: 所以我不确定是否有任何博士。我只是想强调的价值和重要性
 高质量的专业发展，并真正与博士合作。
 为了解决我们将在来年做出的一些重大改变，特别是在社交情感学习领域。
 学校委员会负责的领域之一是学区如何处理停学，这属于社会情感学习行为等。
 所以这绝对是一个重要的优先事项。
 对我们来说，这是专业发展的目标领域之一。
 此外，我们将继续围绕隐性偏见及其对学校社区的影响寻求理解和进一步的专业发展。
 作为教学领导者和教育工作者，我们还将在最佳实践方面进行额外的专业发展。
 关于教育者评估制度，以加强我们所有学校的问责制。
 这是三个大立方体。
 当我们解决隐性偏见时，我们还解决文化能力、反种族主义工作、反仇恨、
 因此，所有这些举措都非常重要，因为我们正在改变学区以满足所有学生和更广泛社区的需求。
 我们还将继续关注残疾意识，并再次找到如何与偏见重叠的方法。
 存在于那里。
 因此，我只是想强调，尽管我们认为我们的优先事项、全区范围内的优先事项都围绕专业发展，但要改变思维方式并真正呈现新信息，专业发展仍然极其重要。
 所以我只是想强调这一部分。
 谢谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=2199.759s">[David Murphy]</a>: 谢谢你，警长。
 库欣博士，根据您对这些项目的参与，您还有什么想补充的吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=2207.372s">[Peter Cushing]</a>: 是的，很快，主管就很好地解释了我们希望晋升的职位。
 此外，我们正在做的是，在 6 月底，我们将提供一个针对课堂内隐性偏见和社会情感学习的培训师培训计划，每个课程将在整个学区配备 20 名工作人员。
 呃,培训了之后就可以部署到区里去,在区里进行专业发展了.
 这种模式将使我们能够实现非常有利可图的盈利，同时也使我们能够以最适合梅德福需求的方式全年实施专业发展。
 嗯，我们将能够更好地吸引我们的团队。
 与他们的同事和学校领导，无论是校长、校长还是副校长，他们将接受这些培训，然后转身并能够为自己实施这一世界级的专业发展。
 我认为这对梅德福来说是一个很好的机会，可以为我们的团队迈出下一步，提供最好的职业发展。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=2280.431s">[David Murphy]</a>: 谢谢你，博士。
 然后去财务和运营办公室。
 正如您所看到的，这里有一些不同点。
 我将重点关注三个方面，包括交通，我认为它有自己的幻灯片，而且确实如此，谢谢。
 但首先，前两个，这是在昨晚的演讲中提到的。
 我认为这是在英语学习部门确定的优先事项的背景下发生的。
 想要投资一个机会来发展我们的努力，主要是我们的家庭承诺和社区关系。
 我当时指出，我们没有确定 22 财年对 EL 部门的具体投资的部分原因是我们从该地区获得了一项投资，我们希望能够推动这一事业，我们将为此努力。
 与 EL 部门、卫生服务部门、特殊教育部门等密切合作。
 我认为，当我们考虑如何构建组织以及如何组织特定的工作组合时，作为一般规则，最佳实践是确定需求，确定正在满足的需求或由于其他变化变量而正在发展的需求，
 然后确定如何最好地开发适合组织结构的角色和组合，以促进这些目标。
 然而，有时会出现多种事件同时发生的情况，我们的领导人员具有可用的能力和不断出现且变得更加紧迫的需求。
 这种融合发生在整个学年。
 老实说，引起我们注意的方式之一是当我们需要将整个行政部门转移到学校担任代课教师时。
 当我们清楚地意识到这令人筋疲力尽且几乎不可能时，我们试图做出不同的修改，我们的课前和课后规划主任继续自愿承担这项工作，并继续与我们沟通，就像她一段时间以来所做的那样，她觉得
 他的投资组合中有空间容纳额外的责任和信心类型，以及我们作为经理和领导者所拥有的个人能力。
 事实上，我们能够度过本学年，但通过能够确定我们可以在父母和家庭参与领域改进和更好地工作的做法，
 我指望黛安·考德威尔（Diane Caldwell）的帮助，她是我们的前副总监，曾担任家长信息中心的高级主任。
 我要说的是，作为一个新来这个学区的人，我在第一周继承了家长信息中心作为我的投资组合的一部分，没有夫人。
 考德威尔，
 如果能够提供这种领导力、指导和机构知识，这将是更具挑战性的一年，不仅是在对 PIC 的监督方面，而且在我和其他高级管理人员负责的工作的几乎所有其他要素方面。
 但我们从一开始就知道，
 考德威尔担任家长信息中心的管理员并不是一个永久的解决方案，他试图在内部运作
 在我们的预算范围内，我们不一定打算为家长信息中心主任作为一个没有其他职责的单一职位提供资金。
 然后是夫人。
 Fidler 表达了承担额外责任的意愿和热情。
 我们认为家长信息中心与贫困学校和缺勤学校计划之间有着紧密的自然联系，以及额外的支持
 呃，我们需要的能力，嗯，我们需要在家庭关系、交通方面的能力。
 嗯，我们认为这适合作为一个合法的、全面的管理组合。
 因此，作为 22 财年预算的一部分，我们建议将这些办公室重组为一般家庭参与区域，其中包括对家长信息中心的监督、对课前和课后计划的持续监督。
 以及交通连接等服务。
 现在，坦率地说，所有这些角色组合在一起的原因之一是它们是学年的不同部分，需要更大程度的关注和细节。
 这就是为什么我说这是一种融合，因为它非常适合与已经具备机构知识的人一起创建一个完整的 12 个月的角色。
 并在过去为该地区做出了出色的工作。
 这就是为什么能够有效地做到这一点，同时也对如何更有效地推进学区围绕家庭和社区伙伴关系的目标充满信心，是制定该提案的一部分。
 所以这是一场戏。
 然后你会看到，正如昨晚也提到的，
 我们设立了赠款协调员职位。
 这本身是一个非预算的事情，它不一定会对运营预算和赠款产生影响，这个人基本上一直担任非官方赠款协调员一段时间，但从技术上讲，在行政助理的角色中，我们已经能够将该人调到财务和运营办公室，与米歇尔·金登和她的团队合作，以确保我们
 履行我们的所有义务并尽可能有效地从合规角度执行。
 这是不同的，我想强调这一点。
 这当然与我们目前没有的拨款写作角色不同，但我们正在探索其他方法来释放一些能力，让管理员有机会更好地培养外部合作伙伴关系和
 并寻找赠款机会，以便我们的赠款协调员能够帮助协调并尝试以这种方式释放额外的预算能力。
 在我们谈论交通之前，我想再说一遍，这是我们昨晚谈话的延续。
 在本学年中，我们继续与 Management Solution 和 Paquette 先生保持合作关系，Paquette 先生担任临时代理
 夫人之间的业务管理员
 帕特森和我。
 我们已准备好委托提交给学校委员会的报告。
 基本上，我要求对报告进行附录，因为该报告是在整个学年中准备的，并在某种程度上促进了预算制定过程。
 我问帕克特先生，根据我们仍然拥有的预付款，
 基本上，您可以填写一些补充内容，其中会考虑到我们所做的一些更改，夫人。
 Kimu 和我在过去的几个月里将这一点付诸实践。
 这就是为什么我预计在本财年结束之前将其提交给委员会。
 然后，帕克特先生，我们与塔夫茨大学的合作伙伴关系，一开始只是测试合作伙伴关系，后来发展为对话。
 在技​​术基础设施的背景下，我希望我们整个夏天都能非常有效地从中受益。
 但随后我们还将探讨在展望 2022 财年时我们应该保留或可能参考的其他外部知识。
 这是一个高层次的概述。
 我将结束交通，然后继续回答您的问题。
 如果您还记得当我们谈论 22 财年的预测时，我们的成本增加了约 51,000。
 我必须快速地说，这些是因为它们是在 5 月 6 日解决的。
 这些与我们与特殊教育相关的固定交通成本无关。
 这是我们的主要供应商东方巴士。
 学校委员会于 2020 年春季签订了一份为期三年的新合同。
 所以，我们正在完成其中的第一个。
 的三年合同。
 与合同一样，成本逐年增加。
 因此，我们预计该合同将增加约 51,000 美元，作为我们预计固定成本增加 210 万美元的一部分。
 4 月 26 日，当提出有关 MBTA 通行证的请求时，您已经看到了以下两个数字。
 这本质上是我们的一个选择
 确保委员会知道。
 然后还有一些问题，涉及额外黄色巴士的基本成本以及在高中提供额外东区巴士容量的可能性。
 我们估计约为 75,000 美元。
 我之所以说它是零到 75,000 美元，是因为在我们与供应商的对话中，他们有，
 我认为，并且我很欣赏这一点，我不知道是否所有提供商都会这样做，但他们建议，根据本学年之前该学区采用的半径，就初中和高中交通而言，有可能重新调整我们现有的一些能力，以提供至少一辆额外的巴士到高中。
 下周我们将与
 巴士提供商以及梅德福警察局，我们将在那里讨论一系列问题，既与安全有关，也与规划即将到来的夏季学年的路线和站点的开发有关。
 所以，坦率地说，我目前没有向委员会提出关于是否应该增加第二辆公共汽车的任何建议。
 我认为很明显我们可以做到这一点。
 所以我认为问题在于查看有关哪里的数据
 什么是高中生以及是否有需求。
 我要说的是，在我与中等教育管理部门的简短对话中，我们根本不清楚是否知道对此有明确的需求，但我认为我们要牢记这一点。
 但与此同时，如果为学生提供更方便的服务的成本在 0 到 75,000 美元之间，那么显然我们会考虑这一点。
 我认为从战略角度来看，我们需要牢记 MBTA 通行证显然有可能提供更多的准入机会。
 而且，你知道，你开始考虑学生工作、去城市的机会。
 城市还有其他类型的体验，例如 MBTA 通行证可以为学生提供的课堂和体验式学习体验。
 我们正在考虑所有这些选择。
 贯穿所有演示的一个共同点是，我们决心在 21-22 学年为学生建立有效的延长上课日和课外活动计划，利用 ESSER 资金确保我们在学生面临重大干扰后提供尽可能最大的恢复支持。
 因此，我感谢您抽出时间并在这方面给予我宽容。
 如果你喜欢我可以提供更多证词和证人的演示，我保证我也更喜欢它们。
 但这些是建筑物和土地、财务和运营办公室以及主管办公室的记录。
 此时，我将很乐意回答您的问题。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3062.978s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 谢谢您，先生。
 我们有成员范德克鲁特，然后是成员卢梭。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3068.903s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: 谢谢。
 最后我会继续讲校车交通。
 戴夫，您向我们提供了一些有趣的选择，但价格差异很大。
 此时，当您创建此预算时，
 你是什么人，你在给我们推荐吗？
 来吧，我的意思是，我们如何将成本纳入预算？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3100.169s">[David Murphy]</a>: 嗯，我认为第一个，是的，第一个决定是委员会是否对去年制定的半径与除幼儿园以外所有年级的一英里半径感到满意。
 所以如果这是委员会想要维持的事情
 所以卖家基本上是说其中一所小学的容量会过剩。
 因此，Eastern Bus 现有的价值 140 万美元左右的合同将为我们提供一辆额外的校车，我认为我们应该考虑在高中使用它来扩大容量。
 我唯一的疑问是
 如果我们不这样做，我们可以将其重新定向到课外项目和延长上课时间，而不会产生潜在的 100,000 美元的额外费用。
 或者至少需要付出代价。
 因此，我认为第一个决定是委员会是否对一英里半径感到满意，供应商表示这不会对客流量产生巨大影响。
 基本上这就是我们现在的处境。
 如果是这样的话
 因此，我认为下一步是查看与高中生居住地点相关的数据，以及是否有一条有意义的路径来了解学生在哪里。
 再说一次，我认为这个计划的唯一缺点是 MBTA 批准，他们不只是带你去学校。
 我认为，特别是对于我们的高中生来说，MBTA 通过可以为他们带来大量的体验式学习机会。
 我要说的最后一件事是，如果我们将程序化机会与其收购联系起来，MBTA 通证将成为一项更好的投资。
 我认为可能需要一些时间，也许夏天就足够了，让我们的教学领导者有时间来开发这些类型的机会，最大限度地发挥这种潜在投资的作用。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3230.138s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: 所以，戴夫，让我们回到你所说的关于一英里半径的事情之一。
 我不得不说，我不记得投票过。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3239.024s">[David Murphy]</a>: 所以......这是在我的时代之前，但我的理解是，当这个重新开放计划作为某种大型的、多方面的计划集体提交给学校委员会时，广播是其中的一部分。
 因此，路线和停靠点都进行了调整。
 我还认为，而且我只是偶然知道这一点，
 这是因为今年的乘客量下降了很多，通常情况下你会取消公交车站并听到一波反馈，但今年这种情况并没有实现。
 也有可能是因为受疫情影响，乘客数量大幅减少。
 如果这种情况没有延续到明年，那么您可能需要考虑这一点。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3280.253s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: 是的，我认为我们的乘客数量大幅下降是完全可以理解的。
 我知道在梅德福，一些学生由于担心居住的道路和交通安全而接受公交车服务。
 所以自动说这是一英里，好吧，它从来都不是自动的一英里。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3307.655s">[David Murphy]</a>: 重要的一点，我为此道歉，
 如果您认为这是不言而喻的，那么闪电与安全豁免无关。
 您的巴士站是我们下周谈话的一部分。
 这就是为什么不仅有地区和卖方的代表，还有伦敦警察厅的代表。
 因为当我们审查和分析路线和站点时，我们希望确保任何引起安全问题的站点都经过公共安全专家的仔细检查，并且
 毫无疑问，安全豁免优先于任何其他有关广播的政策。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3344.167s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: 是的，嗯，其中一些是，你知道，感知到的安全性，或者它已经存在了很长时间，任何删除它的举动肯定会引起轩然大波。
 听起来我很乐观地听你说，我们将有一些空间并且能够使用现有的巴士。
 戴夫，这对我来说似乎非常乐观，而且我总体上是一个乐观主义者，但我还没有准备好在两者之间进行平衡。
 是的，最上面有 350 个，这是一个很大的变化。
 还有一些，我只是想说，由于数量如此之多，很难准确理解我们要在预算中投入什么。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3389.268s">[David Murphy]</a>: 是的，这都是一个好点。
 需要明确的是，这些数据回答了委员会的问题。
 不，我不知道，我当然没有关于这 350,000 人从何而来的建议。
 所以说实话。
 好的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3403.415s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: 是的。
 同时，我很感激我的同事们提出了这个问题，因为这是一个问题，这是一个正义问题。
 所以我认为显然我们将就此进行更多对话。
 出色地。
 我把自己交给别人。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3421.005s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 我们是卢梭记忆、克雷茨记忆、格雷厄姆和麦克劳克林的西部。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3426.066s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: 谢谢市长。
 感谢您的介绍。
 我谢谢。
 我想知道在哪里，如果我们已经介绍过这一点，请原谅我，但我认为我们没有体育和乐队的交通工具。
 那还会发生吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3448.128s">[David Murphy]</a>: 问题是，这是否包含在您今晚提供的数据中？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3452.33s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: 是的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3453.891s">[David Murphy]</a>: 不，但这只是因为他靠体育或美术的预算过活。
 然后这些行将恢复到您的纳税年度。
 其中一项从未减少，但将维持或恢复到 2020 财年的数字。
 因此，为了确保我们有足够的交通来参加所有活动和体育赛事以及此类活动。
 这是应部门主管的要求。
 因此，据我所知，没有人呼吁超过 2021 财年之前的水平。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3487.681s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: 好吧，谢谢。
 只是，你知道，似乎记住大流行前的事情有时真的很有挑战性，但是，你知道，我的记忆是这样的，你知道，
 我们交通经费还没有公平地分配给不同类型的群体，所以我就简单说一下。
 我们非常慷慨地提供了与体育相关的交通资金，乐队成员不得不卖掉他们所有的东西来获得足够的钱来支付巴士交通费用。
 这是我的第四个预算。
 四年前，我不是唯一一个这么说的人
 我们需要详细了解每个学生在课外活动上的支出。
 因为相信我的直觉，我没有孩子可以一起运动。
 我有孩子参加乐队。
 我对在没有任何数据的情况下发表宏大的声明或建议政策改变不感兴趣。
 但我的感觉，当我看到运动包时，
 我们合同上的教练与乐队管理人员和其他报酬之间显然存在某种差异，根据投入的小时数可能是适当的，但我无法知道。
 所以我真的很想知道我们是否不偏爱那些决定参加运动的孩子并减轻他们家庭筹集交通资金的负担。
 与乐队中的孩子相比，我只是用这两个例子。
 我确信还有其他人。
 因此，恢复显然比不恢复要好，但我无法知道这是否真的公平。
 这对我来说非常重要。
 这是第四个出现此问题的预算。
 我想要它的第四年，我意识到你不在最后三个预算中。
 那么，你知道，按照每个学生的情况，我们花了多少钱？
 我的意思是，这包括教师合同中的津贴。
 我的意思是，我们花在教育上的所有钱，而不是幼儿园到八年级的钱，我们花在了什么地方？
 他要去哪里？
 这真的公平吗？
 我的意思是，因为我知道体育运动对很多人来说非常重要，
 该禁令对许多人来说非常重要。
 我真的认为我们必须弄清真相。
 我认为这是我们今晚无法解决的问题。
 令我惊讶的是，我并不真正知道这个问题是否正在得到解决。
 但我当然注意到，你没有出现在最近的三个预算中。
 是的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3661.661s">[David Murphy]</a>: 不，这是一个很好的问题。
 我认为你是对的。
 我的意思是，有时会有不同程度的费用。
 我想大多数时候，
 这种差异是由于围绕田径运动存在的和平制度而在各地区造成的。
 我认为这就是你经常看到这种差异的原因，但它们在成为我们教育计划的元素方面发挥着非常相似的作用，吸引学生并让他们坦率地来到这里，当然享受乐趣并充分利用他们的教育。
 所以我很高兴调查这个问题，看看是否有
 是否存在我们可能需要帮助克服的差距。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3704.757s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: 谢谢。
 所以我想我会问我的另一个问题，我看到有与浴室相关的项目。
 再说一遍，这是我的第四年，也是学生们努力研究如何向我们的学生提供月经产品的第四年。
 真尴尬。
 我知道并不是这次会议上的每个人都同意，但这很尴尬。
 CCSR 项目已连续四年开展，以确保经期学生在获取这些产品时不会遇到问题。
 有点令人兴奋。
 我只是想明确表示我不会投票给任何人
 浴室翻新，如果每个翻新的浴室不包括免费的经期产品分配器。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3762.382s">[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>: 爱德华-文森特博士？
 卢索先生，我只是想评论一下，当你这样做时这些台词会让你相信，当学生在高中使用卫生间并且无法使用女性产品时，我们有一整间医疗室。
 女性用品被放置在浴室中，但不幸的是，有时女性用品没有被用于其应有的用途。
 它们被使用，被装饰在浴室中，最后被安装在天花板上。
 这种情况也发生过好几次。
 这是有人监督和监控浴室的。
 所以我们把你们放在那里，CCSR 的学生，我将此作为一个项目，但我希望人们知道医疗室里提供女性用品，并且学生不会被拒绝使用。
 我们在医疗领域拥有广泛的产品，我并不反对获得学生可以使用的机器，但我只是想指出，当我们提供它们时，它们并没有用于其预期目的。
 这也是他们过去最终被淘汰的部分原因。
 所以我只想说，我们并不是想向学生讲话或告诉他们，你知道，这是不可用的。
 我想让每个人都知道它是可用的，并且特别是高中医疗室和高中都有足够的用品。
 所有护理预约均可提供此服务。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3866.52s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: 谢谢。
 市长，如果您能快速回复就好了。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3869.988s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 是的，然后是 Kreatz 成员。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3872.29s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: 是的，我明白。
 我绝不会建议任何人试图否认这些事情。
 我只是建议我们拿一张学校地图，想象一个学生在离医疗室最远的地方。
 我的意思是，在学校委员会成员中，我是这里唯一的一个
 他没有那些经历。
 我只是对你们所有人做出假设，但是，你知道，即使是我也无法想象在这座巨大的建筑中距离医疗室那么远，而且你说你知道它在哪里。
 我走过那栋大楼，想去看看它到底是什么。
 我说，首先，这不是两分钟的步行路程。
 我们正在谈论，我的意思是，我什至不知道时间是什么，但我想，
 我们所认为的获取障碍似乎非常非常低或很高，无论哪个类比是正确的。
 我，你知道，还有其他地区已经这样做了，而我没有，他们没有作为一个大问题出现在世界的头版上。
 我知道，我读到的有关健康的内容，不是《健康青年法案》，我忘记了去年在学校实际要求的是什么法律，
 但有一种最初的情况，当你第一次安装它们并免费提供它们时，它们被粘在天花板上，需要它们的孩子们可以把装满它们的篮子带回家。
 但就像许多事情一样，他们会感到无聊。
 然后当学生需要他们时，他们就会出现。
 所以我不希望这是一个简单的项目。
 我只是坚信
 CCSR，我认为这是一个 CCSR 项目，一周前它进入了我的 Facebook 收件箱，我想是关于学生这样做的。
 他们不这样做是因为他们没有其他事可做。
 所以我认为我们没有倾听学生的意见。
 我正在查看 2016 年 CCSR 页面，这是今年的项目之一。
 我不知道我们什么时候能做到这一点，但谢谢你。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4012.217s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 谢谢克雷斯特议员、格雷厄姆议员、麦克劳克林议员。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4015.74s">[Kathy Kreatz]</a>: 是的，我只是想说谢谢。
 首先，我只是有一个关于交通的问题，但首先我想让大家知道，演讲非常精彩，麦克劳克林先生，你做得很好，以及这些议程项目是什么。
 这将列入下周的议程，我们将在下周的小组委员会会议上进行讨论。
 所以我还有一个问题是关于交通。
 关于此的一些事情是因为我打开了时事通讯，因为我不记得在一英里半径内。
 因此，我在 2021 年神户奥运会期间阅读了交通公告，上面写着，所有公立学校都不会在黄色学校接送学生，无论他们的实际地址在学校两英里半径范围内。
 我们知道这一变化是一个重大负担，我们始终提供超出规定的运输。
 所以我什至不确定我是否拥有正确的信息。
 墨菲先生，你提到的情况，我也没有这方面的信息。
 我不记得有过关于此事的会议。
 所以我只想提一下。
 我认识夫人
 范德克鲁特谈到了这一点。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4092.141s">[David Murphy]</a>: 先生，我只是想澄清一下。
 我说这话时带有一种免责声明，即这件事发生在我来这里之前，但从那以后我就一直参与其中。
 如果有人，如果我的同事想分享他们的回忆，请不要这样做。
 但正如向我解释的那样，当委员会获得 2.0 英里的半径时，
 我知道这是针对高中成绩的。
 再次对此进行了限制，就像我一样，我想我在小学时被告知大约一英里半，但基本上没有强制执行。
 而且，为了减少乘坐公共汽车出行的总人数，有必要通知供应商在小学一级实行一英里的半径，在二级一级实行两英里的半径。
 嘿，他。
 坦率地说，乘坐公共汽车出行的人数大幅下降，以至于目前尚不清楚提供商是否需要强制执行一英里半径。
 顺便说一句，我必须说，这也不适用于幼儿园。
 因此，例外情况是幼儿园和残疾学生的安全豁免，以及个别化教育计划下的交通，这当然也与本次谈话无关。
 但是一英里和两英里半径，一个是基于新冠病毒限制，另一个是基于
 坦率地说，基本上，这是一种不强制执行的限制，这在社区中并不罕见，尤其是当公交车上有空间时。
 这就是我们今年夏天要解决的问题，即与该半径范围内的供应商一起规划路线和停靠点。
 供应商警告说，如果我们这样做，我们可能会拥有合同中预计的 18 辆公交车。
 去年获得批准后，我们​​可能只需要一支由 17 辆公交车组成的车队，这样就可以腾出 18 辆公交车来为高中提供第二辆公交车。
 所以我想，库欣博士，我看到你举起了手。
 如果我有任何错误，请随时纠正我。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4219.238s">[Peter Cushing]</a>: 你没说什么不好的事。
 你说得很准确。
 我想如果你可以说这场大流行病的积极方面之一是它确实加强了校长之间的关系，
 我向那些没有提及自己名字的市政府官员和家长致歉，他们确实致力于建立安全上学路线，通过停停停走的公交车数量来减少我们的化石燃料足迹，并创造适合步行的校车，为学生提供安全的上下学方式。
 并寻找其他方法来确保我们为孩子们提供安全的上学机会，同时意识到，虽然这是一个由大流行引发的问题，但还有其他与化石燃料、交通、拥堵等相关的问题，我想说，我们所有中小学校长在去年进行这些对话时也考虑到了这些问题。
 他们会见了人们，绘制了前往学校的路线。
 我们获得了所有学生所在位置的 GIS 地图数据。
 当我们遇到大流行时，我们做了相当彻底的分析，以真正审视所有这一切，然后我们研究了大流行可能存在的改变习惯和心态的机会。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4309.15s">[Kathy Kreatz]</a>: 谢谢。
 谢谢。
 我还有一个问题，可能是下一学年的健康信息。
 墨菲先生，我不确定您是否已经在场，但帕特森知道这一点。
 因为我们在劳动节之前回到学校，而有了 MBTA，在劳动节之前的几天，MBTA 不适用于高中生，所以一直存在担忧。
 在劳动节前几天，孩子们回到学校。
 我，你知道，我们会收到学生在公交车站等候但公交车不在那里的消息。
 他们最终步行并上学迟到了。
 因此，为下学年做准备。
 增加了一辆黄色校车，在最初的几天里，它会开往一些最频繁的车站接载高中生。
 我不记得所有细节，但我只是想让你知道，这是一个持续存在的问题。
 每年，因为我们在劳动节之前开始。
 然后，劳动节过后，MBT 巴士将按正常上课时间运行。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4398.254s">[David Murphy]</a>: 夫人。
 Kreatz，我真的很感激。
 这不是我熟悉的东西。
 我会尽快进行自我教育。
 我的第一个问题是劳动节过后那辆公共汽车会怎样？
 因为如果它在那周可用，我会有点好奇它如何或为何可用。
 对此我想说的是，</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4416.775s">[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>: 这是梅德福的长期做法，东部巴士公司知道这一点，因为我们比许多邻近学区开学早，所以他们会这样做，并可以调整巴士以帮助我们在其他学区开学之前度过前三天。
 所以他们能够做到这一点，这是他们熟悉的事情，我们肯定会继续这种做法，Kreatz 成员。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4444.807s">[David Murphy]</a>: 谢谢。
 是的，我想我们肯定会继续实践，而且，在与东方巴士的会议上，我想我们也会强调容量的问题，因为当我们在 4 月 26 日讨论这个问题时，我从委员会那里听到的感觉是，如果有一种具有成本效益的方式为高中提供额外的黄色巴士交通，那么这就是我们应该考虑的事情。
 所以，我们将再次进行很多对话，他们是一个非常好的合作伙伴。
 去年非常受欢迎。
 所以我希望我们能够继续与他们进行对话。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4480.762s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 谢谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4482.966s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 议员格雷厄姆.
 谢谢。
 我真的很欣赏主管的建议中对专业发展的关注，当然，只要有一个伴随培训师培训的可持续发展计划，而不是一个培训师培训模型，培训师培训模型就可以真正有效。
 一家早期的初创公司失败了，因为在火车上重新开始，巴士计划太贵了，所以我只是想确保我们制定了可持续发展计划，以真正最大化投资。
 关于交通问题，我想提出一项动议，要求预算包括或假设从 21-22 学年开始，我们的学生将不再有交通费用。
 政府将在 8 月 1 日之前向我们提交一份全面的计划，为该地区制定交通建议。
 我在最后添加这个的原因是因为
 我从很多人那里听说，孩子们乘坐 MBTA 巴士意味着他们经常迟到且不可靠，家长们正在做出其他安排来送孩子上学，因为他们觉得自己不能信任 MBTA 巴士。
 认为还有其他学生严重依赖这些 MBTA 巴士通行证才能
 我个人并没有听说过能够以不同的方式工作和乘坐公共汽车，但我不想忽视社区中有些成员处于这种情况的事实。
 因此，我希望我们再次解决交通问题，并希望大家与东部巴士公司、警察局和任何其他机构合作。
 我们希望社区能够找出最佳的前进道路。
 库欣博士，我还要告诉你，我记得关于一英里或两英里半径的对话以及关于不在小学阶段强制执行半径的类似事情。
 当墨菲先生谈到幼儿园是一个例外时，我想我开始思考如果这样应用的话，
 一英里与两英里或类似的东西。
 然而，你仍然必须去以前不会去的地方接幼儿园的孩子。
 您如何在实际或战术上只为最近半径内的幼儿园学生提供服务？
 所以我觉得有很多关于交通的讨论需要解决。
 但我希望预算能明确反映出学生明年上学不会有困难。
 您想打电话还是我应该问其他问题？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4679.808s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 我只是想要它，你也想要它，我只是不知道如果管理员在 8 月 1 日之前不给我们这个计划，他们将在预算中投入什么。
 所以我只是想确保管理层和财务团队清楚这一点。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4694.075s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 我认为当我们得到最终报价时，财务团队可以解决这个问题。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4699.617s">[David Murphy]</a>: 嗯，我想我唯一想说的是，梅里克，
 我理解该动议的意思是我们不希望任何学生依赖必须用自己的钱购买的 MBTA 通行证才能上学。
 现在，我认为有不同的方法来探索这个问题。
 我认为最经济的方法是增加一辆黄色巴士，至少增加一辆黄色巴士。
 正如我所说，这可能是免费的。
 理论上，这可能是预算中性的。
 我认为除此之外，可能会有不止一辆黄色巴士，然后可能会有除一辆巴士之外的任何其他巴士，这肯定会对预算产生某种影响。
 然后我认为我们必须解决的另一个问题是会有学生想要打折的 MBTA 通行证。
 我不接受建议我们终止与 MBTA 的合作伙伴关系并停止提供 MBTA 通行证的动议，因为如果有学生出于任何原因想要购买通行证，
 我们当然希望我们的学生能够像其他学区的学生一样获得折扣通行证。
 因此，我认为我们将继续该计划，但我认为我们只需要从本质上检查通行证在学生中的用途。
 因此，如果他们依赖它，我们需要支付 MBTA 通行证的费用或为学生提供替代的上学选择。
 现在我想
 这一切都取决于我们销售了多少通行证以及有多少购买通行证的学生依赖它们。
 那么黄色巴士的路线是怎样的呢？
 这当然是有层次的，但委员会肯定有明确的指导。
 如果我们在执行方面遇到任何问题，无论是从预算还是后勤的角度来看，我们都会回来。
 对我来说，可以想象可能有一群学生
 当我们说，好吧，你购买这张通行证是因为你需要它去上学，因为你需要它去上班，因为你只是想要一张打折的 MBTA 通行证。
 他们会说，听着，伙计，我只想要通行证。
 这是我的 30 美元。
 我会担心去学校的问题。
 在这一点上，我不认为我们违反了政策。
 我想我们找到了一个学生，他决定参加 MBTA 去学校，无论他是否准时到达。
 再说一次，我认为意图非常非常明确。
 我认为我们将尽一切努力来执行它。
 如果我们发现自己处于无论从预算角度还是仅仅从实施角度来看根本不可能的情况，我们将必须与委员会保持公开对话。
 但我当然理解这个意图。
 正如我所说，我们将尽力做到这一点。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4879.947s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 那么您希望该决议如何措辞？
 格雷厄姆副警长和墨菲先生，以便我们了解 6 月 1 日（而不是 8 月 1 日）之前我们会看到什么。
 我想这已经很清楚了。
 嗯，你提到了 8 月 1 日的日期，我只想知道我支持什么，将提供什么以及何时提供。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4905.178s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 因此，预算将包括上学不花钱的假设。
 在此之前，修改后的运输计划和战略并不是可以合理完成的。
 这就是距离 8 月 1 日还需要多长时间。
 至于具体情况，MBTA通行证是对所有人免费还是有黄色巴士的策略，这就是我们正在改变的策略？
 在一到两英里的半径内，所有这些显然都会对预算产生影响，就像预算批准后该地区发生的所有事情一样。
 但预算必须反映成本能力，使我们能够不要求学生付费上学。
 明白了吗，墨菲先生？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4960.204s">[David Murphy]</a>: 是的，我的意思是，我认为唯一的警告，我并不是真的想对此挑剔，是我认为我们现在不要求任何人付费上学。
 事实上，有些学生正在乘坐 MBTA 巴士，理论上我们学校黄色巴士运力不足，因此需要根据他们的居住地、家庭情况或其他情况来选择。
 因此，实际上，他们支付上学费用，但这并不像学区政策规定的那样，除非您乘坐自己付费的 MBTA 巴士，否则我们不会让您上车。
 因此，我认为我们希望收集当前学生人数的数据，希望也能观察一段时间，看看我们出售了多少 MBTA 通行证，并假设这是我们必须提供的限制。
 因此，我认为我们会看看是否可以通过增加黄色巴士的容量来从成本角度减少这一点。
 因此，我认为，当我们出售 MBTA 通行证时，因为正如我们之前讨论的那样，我们不想阻止我们的学生获得打折通行证。
 所以我认为我们必须收集有关通行证的数据。
 通行证是根据偏好使用，还是更多地根据偏好或缺乏而购买
 其他到达学校的方式。
 所以我觉得这个意图是非常明确的。
 就像我说的，我们将正确执行它，只有当我们遇到后勤障碍或者事情变得似乎不可能时，我们才必须回来。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5066.605s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 麦克劳克林议员，关于这项动议。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5068.707s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: 关于这项动议，谢谢。
 只是为了澄清，
 从角度来看，我想我只是想澄清是否有这样的事情，但问题长期以来是我们有付费办学的学生，其中许多人是经济弱势群体，
 可能在两英里半径内，或至少在两英里半径内。
 如果你考虑一下两英里半径的限制，比如说，麦格林附近、麦格林高中附近的学生，步行上下学，因为他们负担不起，或者不得不选择，你知道，每月支付 30 美元购买折扣通行证，这可能会对他们的家庭产生很大影响。
 我认为这只是
 道德价值观是一种声明，我们的预算反映了我们的价值观，我想我对历史上的这种情况感到惊讶，甚至坐在讲台另一边的学校委员会，学生必须为此付费。
 到学校的交通，特别是因为这是一个无法做到这一点的学生，然后你想想缺勤率是多少，饥饿率是多少，你知道什么，有这么多，有这么多影响，所以这项动议会知道我更希望它是 MBTA 通行证，但我会让财务委员会这样做并给我们一个
 您知道，在我们评估这一点时，我们可以在下一次会议或最后一次会议中进一步了解成本效益分析。
 但我想搁置这个问题，并且我支持格雷厄姆先生的动议。</p>

 是的，有议案规定中学的半径为三公里，因为在现行政策下，即使我们把黄色巴士卸下来，这些学生也不会乘坐黄色巴士。
 但我，我不知道，我不知道 MBTA 通行证能做什么，但如果学生住在距离学校四分之一英里的范围内，我们仍然会确保该学生有免费交通，即使

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5341.68s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: 谢谢。
 我认为我的具体问题是经济困难的学生必须付费
 去学校的交通。
 因此，无论是在两英里半径内，还是在两英里半径内，或者一英里半径或我们提供的任何范围内。
 我知道过去，老师会花钱让学生进入 MBTA。
 交通通行证。
 因此，墨菲先生，谈到您的观点，这可能需要进一步考虑，不一定是针对该特定动议或补充，您知道通过的动议，但就您的观点而言，这允许 MBTA 通行证允许在城市中使用，它们可以允许在城市中使用教室，它们可以允许就业机会，
 可能允许前往学校的交通。
 让我担心的最重要的子集：你要问问题吗？
 是的。
 在这个考虑中，我们是否关注经济弱势群体？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5405.854s">[David Murphy]</a>: 嗯，我认为这项动议……我认为它属于每个人。
 是的，我想都是这样。
 是的，它比经济弱势群体更广泛，但不包括方圆两英里内的学生。
 这为我们提供了一个数据点类似于格里沙姆博士之前所说的使用 GPS 从数据图形角度进行识别，你知道，我们可以说，好吧，这是我们的学生群体，我们需要确保他们免费上学。
 与我们在劳动节之前所做的事情类似，如果我们简单地在房间里放一辆公共汽车，我们就可以容纳大部分学生。
 如果我们能做到这一点，我认为这可能是一个非常容易遵守的指令。
 如果我们观察并说，好吧，我们在劳动节之前使用的那辆公共汽车只为 15% 的学生提供服务。
 为了服务社区的不同区域，我们需要六辆新巴士。
 因此，也许我们必须回过头来说，我们将不得不以另一种方式重建，因为我们现在没有可持续的方法来做到这一点。
 因此，到那时，我们可能必须缩小经济上处于不利地位的目标对象的范围，因为女士。麦克劳克林说道。
 再说一遍，我不知道具体结果如何，但我认为我们有明确的方向，并且很高兴向前迈进。</p>

 我有点惊讶地看到财务部门没有职位变动或建议，因为我有一种感觉
 对于该办公室的员工数量而言，该办公室总是有太多的工作要做。
 那是什么？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5519.74s">[David Murphy]</a>: 我说，这也是我的印象，但不在这里。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5523.442s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 确实如此，但在这里我们不要求解决这个问题。
 这是为什么？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5527.325s">[David Murphy]</a>: 因为在委员会中，您会记得，2021 财年所倡导的基本上是两个席位的容量。
 我们尝试做的是，首先，在第 70 章的分配中，我们添加了控制员的位置。
 这是夫人。
 金登每周都在让他看起来不像平时那么愚蠢方面发挥了重要作用。
 它还带来了法学院没有涵盖的会计技能和经验，对此我很感激。
 此外，
 我们重新调整了已演变为赠款协调员角色的行政助理职位，并将其重新定位在财务办公室作为赠款协调员。
 这就是我们将产能扩大到目前的原因。
 你会发现，嗯，在你的薪资表上，行政助理，行政助理职位的替代者，我很抱歉，总结一下，
 这一切都是在 2021 财年完成的。
 赠款协调员的中性预算再次通过 8 月份的第 70 章拨款获得。
 这扩大了我们的能力，使我们能够更好地为该地区服务。
 财务和运营预算中唯一保留的优先事项是薪资水平。
 在我们这样做之前，您应该先与全区范围内的人交谈，只是为了明确全区范围的薪资标准是多少，目前支持两名助理总监的行政助理职位在补充后将支持所有三名助理总监，因此也将增加财务办公室在这方面的能力。
 所以，实际上，我们将有，
 再次强调，我们无意扩大财务部门的规模。
 你昨晚听到我说，作为 22 号应用预算的一部分制定的预算优先事项是由最直接支持学生的因素驱动的。
 我当然可以理解那些在学校社区工作的人会认为财务和运营办公室不一定是最接近孩子们的。
 但为了更好地服务该地区并使儿童受益，我们需要拥有合适的员工。
 通过增加拨款协调员职位、财务总监职位和部分行政助理职位，我们相信我们将能够更好地做到这一点。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5687.179s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 谢谢你。
 然后我的最后评论只是说我不赞成花钱
 浴室或凯伦剧院或入口修复项目的资本资金，直到有一个真正的总体规划满足高中的长期需求。
 这是很多钱。
 总共大约是一百万美元的四分之一，当我们说时，这并不是无关紧要的，
 比如 10 个权力专业人士、很多很多老师、我们无法纳入预算的人。
 除了没有明确的建设计划的支出之外，还有许多其他优先事项。
 我之前已经说过这一点，但为这座建筑制定清晰的规划是至关重要的。
 在此之前，我不能支持以一种将我们束之高阁或束缚我们手脚的方式花费社区资金，以满足该建筑的最大需求，而这些需求尚未得到评估。

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5768.462s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 就这一点而言，如果你能指出来自锅炉和科学实验室的 800,000 以上和 100,000 必须用于资本项目。
 所以我认为有很多。
 高中需要大量的关注和愿景委员会，而我们所做的工作将需要数年时间。
 所以，我的意思是，我恭敬地不同意。
 我想强调这一点。
 麦克劳克林议员。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5796.765s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: 谢谢。
 我有一些问题。
 我想我会从这个开始，因为这是最后一个话题。
 我想我希望下一个议程包括 MHS 愿景委员会，这样我们在考虑花钱时就能了解他们的立场。
 我只是不想在坏事之后浪费好钱。
 关于高中已经有很多讨论，我们还没有召开愿景委员会。
 我希望将此纳入下一个议程。
 因此，回到运输主题，总统会问墨菲先生将计划性机会与其收购联系起来是什么意思吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5847.308s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: 我不知道，我没听懂你在说什么。
 你在谈论交通，很抱歉，我引用了你的话。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5854.951s">[David Murphy]</a>: 抱歉，我想我们正在谈论 MBTA 通行证。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5857.612s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: 是的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5858.012s">[David Murphy]</a>: 我所说的，我认为你也发表了类似的评论，夫人。
 McLaughlin 表示，MBTA 通过对于学生上学来说是一项很好的投资。
 如果购买 MBTA 通行证之间存在关联，那么它们就是一笔巨大的投资。
 计划和教学机会让学生融入社区并提供体验式学习机会。
 我不知道，当然有很多老师和 CCR，CCSR 就是一个很好的例子，但是有很多高中教学机会渗透到社区和整个教育世界，超越了课堂。
 但如果我们想增加投资
 并投资MBTA通行证，所以在我看来，如果我们这样做，并从教学角度思考，并尝试扩大我们的体验式学习机会，我认为这本身至少是一件好事，但当我们还提供此类资源以使学生更容易获得时，它就会被放大。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5931.149s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: 谢谢。
 我认为这就是你的意思，并希望得到澄清，因为我想象的是，例如，职业学生运送到现场，CCSR 志愿者和所有类似的东西。
 因此，当我们考虑对这些不同选项的成本分析时，了解程序化机会是什么会很有趣。
 所以我知道我们不仅有东部巴士，还有我们的交通提供商。
 我们有多家运输提供商，他们之间存在一些问题。
 就我个人而言，我们与运输提供商之间存在一些问题，我知道很难维持或留住员工。
 尤其是在目前的情况下。
 但我想知道是否有一个集中的机会，或者几乎像一个 C-click 解决方案，你知道，一种选择，或者，你知道，投诉热线或其他东西，我们可以收集社区中有关我们交通的实际情况的数据，因为我们向供应商支付了很多钱，而且我觉得供应商不需要承担任何责任。
 供应商提供的产品并不一致，甚至在我见过的一些合同中也是如此。
 父母带着信回家，说如果你早上错过了公共汽车，他们下午就不会来接你，这完全是违规的，对吗？
 你不能那样做。
 但这是针对特殊教育交通的。
 但这是我们特别看到的一张牌。
 这就是我要说的。
 合同、预算以及索赔流程的类型都需要保持一定的一致性。
 为什么是的
 一名管理员听取有关某个部门的投诉，另一名管理员听取另一个部门的投诉，例如谁集中了这些投诉，以便我们作为学校委员会了解这些供应商的报价是什么以及它们是否合理。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6050.083s">[David Murphy]</a>: 不，我很感激你提到这一点，夫人。
 麦克劳克林和我，正如我们在演讲开始时所说的那样，这是我们想要重组以聘请一位致力于家庭的关键人物的主要原因之一。
 这并不是说，一旦我们有了家庭参与总监，就永远不会有投诉，或者永远不会有投诉得不到我们希望的立即、实质性回应，因为大型组织的本质是，有时会发生一些事情，而我们要在一段时间后才能真正发现。
 有时我们会听说，但会有冲突
 你知道，这是一个关于真实发生的故事。
 因此，我不想建议通过对这些办公室的重组，以某种方式，永远不会出现额外的问题，因为，你知道，这就是现实。
 然而，与此同时，我们预计家庭参与办公室将在许多方面充当有更直接和更频繁联系的办公室之间的中央促进者。
 与家人的沟通，包括一些课前和课后的托管计划、第一次进入学校社区时的注册流程、医疗服务（其中与家人的沟通往往依赖于生命），当然还有特殊教育，而交通是其中的重要组成部分，因为我们在教学环境中与家庭和家长互动，
 其中一些基本的运营后勤问题是家庭最依赖学区解决的问题，可以说，让这些办公室作为轮子上的辐条，我认为从沟通的角度来看将有所帮助，并确保需要了解其中一些问题的管理员能够迅速得到通知。
 因此，麦克劳林代表，我唯一不同意你的评论的一点是，
 建议任何供应商都不承担任何责任。
 问责制可以通过不同的方式进行，有时甚至可以在多个时间范围内进行。
 但我要说的是，虽然政府，当然还有女士。
 鲍文办公室尤其意识到这些问题，我们非常重视并做出回应。
 如果家长或监护人发现看护者没有履行对学区学生或家庭的责任，我们希望立即了解这一情况。
 我们当然承诺始终会做出强有力的回应，因为您所描述的情况，您知道，撤离是完全不可接受的，也不是我们所能容忍的。
 由我们自己的团队或与我们有联系的任何供应商提供。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6238.19s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: 谢谢。
 市长，请允许我澄清一下，学生服务主任一直非常热情，但我也一直是一个吵闹的圈子。
 我会想到那些不这样做的人，以及他们如何应对，以及他们如何证明交通正在发挥作用。
 坦率地说，我认为这与数据收集有关。
 还有孩子上学迟到之类的事情。
 但我再次认为，关注我们的供应商很重要。
 最后，我想再次赞扬主管围绕隐性偏见和社会情感学习对更大的专业发展和有针对性的专业发展的指导。
 我从员工和社区成员那里听到了我想强调的关于职业发展的两点。
 其中之一就是
 我认为一些专业员工不一定觉得有特定的专业发展，你知道，非常特定的许可证或需求，所以我想介绍这一点
 你知道，只是担心确保专业人员辅助人员的参与和专业发展，这与专业人员辅助人员有关，似乎社会情感学习部分肯定会成为其中的一部分，但我想确定这一点，而且我知道在过去，我认为很多时候专业人员辅助人员已经去了老师去的地方。
 他们是副教授，据我了解，你也知道这个道理。
 但我认为能够让人们有一些灵活性和职业发展选择也很好。
 所以这些不是我期待今晚得到答案的事情，但我只是想提一下它们，以便你们知道。
 谢谢。</p>

 我真的不认为你有能力经历一年的聚会和一年的缺勤，并计算到学校的距离以及他们是否乘坐公共汽车或类似的东西，这似乎是很多工作。
 但这是我们在不考虑其影响的情况下做出的政治决定。
 教育成果，因为，你知道，如果我们总是回到这一点，如果你不在学校，你肯定没有在学习。
 所以，你知道，我自己的去公交车站或不去学校的经历，这在梅德福也肯定会发生。
 因此，当我们谈论一英里与两英里时，我认为我们还需要认识到这不仅仅是财务影响。
 对所有分数都有影响。
 主管真的很喜欢她的 MCAS 分数，你知道，它们是衡量标准，无论她是否喜欢 MCAS，它们都是衡量标准，这很重要。
 但这是一项会影响指标的具体政策。
 不，我的意思是，不，我不是要求一份报告，但我从经验中知道这绝对是事实。
 如果你错过了公共汽车，你就不能去学校了。
 当然，如果我错过了公共汽车并且没有交通工具，我就无法步行去学校，但是
 我确信有很多孩子如果错过了公共汽车，就会完蛋。
 但对于那两英里半径内的所有孩子来说，都没有公交车。
 因此，当下一场大雨、令人讨厌的冷雨时，在全球变暖使气温达到 70 度之前我们经常遇到这种情况，在那些日子里，如果你乘坐公共汽车，
 与您不乘坐公共汽车并且预计步行至少 40 分钟才能到达学校的情况不同。
 所以我没有任何问题。</p>

 谢谢。

 Kreatz 会员，请帮我取消静音。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6554.746s">[Kathy Kreatz]</a>: 啊，好吧，我们开始吧。
 是的，那么关于我们今晚提出的动议，墨菲先生是否会向我们提供一份报告，概述各种费用，例如，我们是否会为该学区的所有学生使用黄色巴士，或者我们是否会考虑为所有学生购买 MBTA 巴士通行证？
 这是一个可以在预算时进行分析的提案，以便我们了解它如何符合预算？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6595.799s">[David Murphy]</a>: 我认为我们将尝试制定一个计划，该计划不包括高中两英里半径之外依赖必须购买的 MBTA 通行证的学生。
 我们将如何实现这一目标，我认为我们需要一点时间来弄清楚，但我只是说，我不应该对此进行猜测，但我只是想说，我的直觉告诉我，这必须是一个多方面的计划，我们要增加黄色巴士的运力。
 我们有 X 份 MBTA 通行证，学区正在吸收这些通行证的成本并可能进行探索
 其他协会帮助支付总体成本，并考虑我们可以收集哪些数据来确定学生购买 MBTA 的基础。
 因此，我认为要做到这一点，我们必须研究每一个杠杆。
 我认为，据我了解，如果我们在 8 月 1 日之前知道
 我们将通知委员会，这不是我们在财务或后勤上可以做到的事情。
 我想，我正在通知委员会，而不仅仅是举手说，对不起，我们不能这样做。
 我想我们会说的是，你知道，在我们之前
 这些都是释放大量购买通行证的学生的障碍。
 所以，在那一刻，对于夫人来说。
 麦克劳克林，那么我们可以考虑如何针对经济困难的学生。
 所以我认为这是多方面的，但就像我说的，方向很明确，我们必须朝这个方向前进，我们将尽一切努力使其成为现实。</p>

 最初，在选举后不久，出于对委员会组成的担忧，大流行病介入了。
 至关重要的是，我们必须确定我们要走向何方。
 我们要选举一个全新的委员会吗？
 有人表示感兴趣。
 现在，我们需要成立一个委员会，因为我理解珍妮的担忧。
 我还想确保这座建筑适合那里的孩子居住。
 所以我认为有一个
 我认为，在什么都不做和进行一些必要的改进以使建筑物保持令人满意的状态之间存在一个中间立场。
 形式为学生当前使用的形式。
 但最重要的是，我们必须确定愿景委员会的组成、我们对他们的要求以及我们设想的时间表。
 也许6月底还不是开始的时候。
 我明白。
 但我们必须做好准备，把重点放在九月初，而不是等待另一个学年过去。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6870.91s">[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>: 我只是想说，我想提醒委员会，我相信是在 2019 年 12 月，当我去理事会面前时，800,000 美元被分配给了浴室。
 我只想
 我想说，我强烈支持翻新高中综合楼的一些浴室，因为它们迫切需要改进和翻新。
 我同意我们需要制定一个更全面的计划，但整个建筑群中最现代化的浴室位于科学翼楼。
 这是针对拥有真正现代化浴室的整个建筑群的。
 因此，并非所有学生都位于大楼的该区域。
 因此，我希望 2019 年分配的部分资金以及由于大流行和我们真正需要的一切来推进，至少是对一些设施进行翻新和改进。
 其中一些浴室设施。
 我认为这一点至关重要。
 而且，你知道，我只是考虑学生的需求，并说我希望他们能够拥有更新的可用浴室。
 所以我只是想提醒委员会，当我们获得这笔钱时我们做出了承诺。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6969.628s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 谢谢你，爱德华-文森特博士。
 格雷厄姆议员，然后是克雷茨议员。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6974.25s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 我只是想说我同意范德克鲁特议员的观点。
 这并不是说我们反对任何这些项目，也许它们都有道理，但现在缺乏信息使我们可能做出决定，以一种轻率的方式或以一种让一切变得更加复杂的方式花费大量的城市资金。
 当我们真正与专家讨论建筑需求时，就做需要做的事情。
 因此，与您交谈的每个人对于梅德福高中应该发生什么都有自己的看法，我感谢每个人的意见，但我们会有时间和地点咨询专家并描述
 专家认为这座建筑应该发生什么，但到目前为止还没有这样做。
 所以对我来说，我本身并不反对任何这些开支，但我反对我们在没有专家告诉我们的情况下就认为这些开支是审慎的或很好地利用了纳税人的钱。
 事实上，情况正是如此。
 因此，我同意我们必须向前迈进，而且我认为我们必须以开放的心态这样做。
 我清楚地记得，就在大流行之前，当我们与愿景委员会或学校委员会一起走过大楼时，我们会听到委员会成员的意见。
 当他们在走廊里谈论和争论我们可以考虑什么和不能考虑高中时，因为科学翼或因为这个那个。
 我鼓励我们所有人表达我们的意见。
 并真正制定一个计划，使我们能够了解建筑物的需求是什么，以便我们可以快速采取行动并开始实现其中一些目标。
 我要说的最后一件事是，虽然我们讨论了资本计划，但我们并没有制定资本计划。
 因此，有了这 80 万美元，我并不觉得项目短缺，包括几个报废屋顶。
 如何快速到达这里，而综合资本计划没有考虑到这一点。
 因此，我认为我们在资本计划中还有很多工作要做，以便我们能够与市政府其他部门成为良好的合作伙伴，并帮助确保我们地区的需求得到满足，并且我们不会遇到无法维护的情况。
 我们发现自己正处于另一种类似大流行的情况，需要做很多工作才能使建筑物恢复到标准。
 因此，我强烈主张我们优先考虑这项资本计划。
 我不是结构工程师。
 我认为这个委员会中没有人是这样的。
 因此，我希望我们在谈论花费大量纳税人资金的计划时优先考虑这种体验，而且，我认为我们不需要等待很多年才能获得这些信息。
 我认为现在去那里的学生非常重要，公平地说，坦率地说，所有目前在梅德福公立学校就读的学生，现在是推进这一优先事项的时候了。
 我的孩子可能不会从一所与他们现在的学校看起来不同的学校毕业。
 因此，如果我们幸运的话，一年级学生和幼儿园学生可能有机会做一些不同的事情，但前提是我们采取行动。
 所以这取决于我们。
 谢谢。</p>
