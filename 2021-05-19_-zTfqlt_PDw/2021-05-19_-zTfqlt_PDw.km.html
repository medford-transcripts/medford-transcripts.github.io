    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=208.272s">[David Murphy]</a>:  Thank you, Superintendent, Mayor, members of the school committee.
 It's a pleasure to be with you again this evening.
 for our fifth committee of the whole meeting focused on the FY22 budget.
 As the superintendent mentioned, tonight we'll be focused on elements of the central office, specifically the offices that are under both the superintendent and my own supervision.
 As we go through the beginning of the program, as we have each time, we'll be looking at the org chart and talking specifically about the offices whose budgets are
 are here in light of the fact that these are the offices that myself and the superintendent work most closely with.
 While Dr. Kuching, Ms.
 Galussi, Ms.
 Bowen are here, with the exception of Director McLaughlin, we will be really the only presenters and speakers tonight.
 But certainly we'll be eager to answer any questions that you have, both with respect to the offices that we are focusing on tonight and anything else that we've covered
 over the course of the last several weeks.
 And as I mentioned in my message to the committee, both last night and a few minutes ago, we will be having a budget update on the school committee agenda this coming Monday, May 24th.
 And we'll certainly be picking up questions and comments at that point, incorporating and taking in your feedback.
 And that will go into the development of the recommendations that come before you.
 prior to your June 1st statutory hearing.
 So with that, I will start, as we always do, with the timeline for our budget process, beginning with the development of the district's strategic goals and priorities, leading to a series of, some administrators might say, seemingly endless administrative meetings internally, in which we vet various proposals and comments, questions, and suggestions
 principles and evening, but have not been following along for each of the various budget presentations, both at regular school committee meetings, budget subcommittee and the committee of the whole meetings.
 This is where we are right now leading up to that June 1st public hearing in which members of the community will be invited to speak either for or against, or a favorite for those who follow municipal presentations, those wishing to speak neither for nor against.
 the budget in part or in whole.
 And again, that will take place on June 1st, but there will be a budget update on Monday, an opportunity to comment and engage in further discussion.
 We've used the org chart in each of these presentations, just as by way of showing folks, perhaps outside of the Medford Public Schools community,
 which area of the organization we're focused on in this particular meeting.
 So this is the overall org chart showing all the various offices and departments reporting up to the superintendent.
 And then these are the areas that we'll be discussing tonight.
 So you can see it's primarily the areas in my own portfolio, as well as those reporting directly to the superintendent.
 And you see the curvy arrow there on the right of the screen.
 which is indicating a reorganization of sorts that we'll be proposing as part of the FY22 budget, and that's something I'll be going into greater detail about shortly.
 So as we've discussed in each of the budget presentations, the funding for the Metro Public Schools and the funding generally for school districts across Massachusetts comes from various sources.
 What we often refer to as the Chapter 70 allocation, which is the
 The state contribution under state law coming out of ed reform law of 1993 and the funding that each school community and district are entitled to.
 The local contribution, which is the revenue generated from at the local level that is air marked for the for the school department, which in Medford is a very sizable portion of that of the overall
 operating budget.
 And then the sort of extenuating circumstances under which we're currently operating mean we have a significant influx of federal funding coming in as a result of the COVID-related legislation that has come in.
 And that is coupled with the sort of standing external funds that come in on a year-in and year-out basis, particularly in the area of special education, which we discussed at length at the May 6th Committee of the Whole when we heard from the Office of Pupil Services.
 We've said that throughout the FY22 budget, we've asked those contributing to the development of this budget, meaning our department heads and our principals, to focus essentially on three primary buckets of areas in which we're asking them what are their budgetary priorities, what are their needs, what are their challenges.
 First is personnel and staffing.
 And the committee certainly said before that when we're talking about school budgets, we're almost always talking about people.
 We're an organization made up of people, educating people, hoping to make them better people and people who are positioned to do well in their post-secondary lives.
 But that is always going to be the largest chunk of our budget because, you know, as we say sometimes in school finance, we're not focused on widgets.
 We're focused on people in a community, and that's always going to be the largest chunk.
 Materials and infrastructure, particularly under the challenging conditions under which we're operating, are always going to represent
 another, albeit smaller, aspect of the budget.
 And training and professional development, which everything is, we are looking at everything through a post-COVID context, but for training and professional development, when we think about the ways in which some of the inequities, both within public education and society at large, have come into sharper relief as a result of the experience that we've all lived through, we are thinking very much in that context when we talk about
 what are our professional development and training priorities, and what is it that we're looking to invest in.
 And particularly when we're talking about the superintendent's priorities, while much of what we're planning will be supported by external funding, given that the budget development process is the opportunity to really look at the organization as a whole, see how we're structured, how we're organized, what it is that we're pursuing, what are our discrete challenges, what are our long-term overarching challenges,
 This really is an opportunity to sort of pull the veil back on all of the Medford Public Schools.
 And my hope would be that throughout these committee of the whole presentations, as we've heard from the various directors and school leaders, my hope would be that both for the school committee and the members of the community who are either watching this in real time or perhaps watching it subsequent to the presentations, you'll see the effort toward transparency that we have employed to try to demonstrate for the community exactly what it is that we're doing.
 And I hope also
 the rationale behind these priorities.
 And this slide talks a little bit about that rationale in that these are the questions that were posed that led to the development of these priorities and that we're thinking about what are the targeted and intensive interventions that we can invest in to help reduce or eliminate the learning or opportunity gaps that have either been caused by or exacerbated by the disruption to instruction that our students have faced as a result of
 the COVID-19 pandemic.
 And so there will come a time when our budgetary priorities and our goals are not informed fully by this experience and the disruption that our students have lived through.
 At least I certainly hope that's the case.
 One of the sort of constant refrains that we go back to is we're looking to make investments that will ensure our students' academic careers are not defined by this experience.
 And hopefully if we make these investments and we execute on them wisely, that will be the case.
 But for right now,
 coming out of these, as cliche as it might sound, these unprecedented circumstances, we are looking to see how do we use the funding that's available to us from the local, state, and federal levels to try to put them in the best position possible despite the chaos that we've all lived through.
 So on April 26th, we presented to the school committee the projections that we were looking at based on the preliminary information that we had.
 uh, leading into these budget presentations.
 And we've estimated that, uh, the necessary increase in the budget would be somewhere between 3.4 and $5.8 million.
 Recognizing that there are a significant number of variables that are, uh, essentially not clear while variable one, there are restrictions on federal funding flowing in that are still not particularly clear.
 And I appreciate the mayor's comments to that effect.
 last night, but we're continuing to engage in a very constructive dialogue with our partners in the city government and reaching out to our partners at the state level and elsewhere to try to get clarity on that.
 I think at this point we feel comfortable that the priorities we've developed that we think of as having a strong nexus to the disruption caused by COVID will be essentially eligible expenses.
 It's a question of, from an administrative perspective, exactly how
 we'll go about processing those and exactly how realistic is it to do that.
 So I think we feel good about the priorities that we've identified as our COVID-related or potential ESSER-related priorities, but there's still a lot of clarity that needs to come into view in the coming weeks.
 In addition to that, we know we have fixed costs as every district does on a year-on-year basis.
 These are costs that are related to contractual obligations or
 other situations that have essentially predated the development of this budget, but we know that they're going to lead to an increase in costs.
 Other variables also include the fact that we have upwards of nine collective bargaining agreements that are expiring either at the conclusion of this school year or the conclusion of the summer.
 And so that's certainly a factor that we have to take into account as we work through the development of this budget.
 This is just information related to those external funding, the numbers the committee has seen several times before, so I won't
 belabor it, but we estimate about a $7.6 million ESSER budget over the next several years.
 And so I wouldn't say that we necessarily see that as needing to be expended in equal installments over the three or four year period that we have.
 But I would say that we want to be mindful of the fact that we're going to have additional data that will hopefully point us to more strategic uses of the funding as time goes on.
 So it may be the case that some of the more immediate expenses are in the short term, but the better use of the funding could be in year two or year three.
 And for that reason, we are looking to be, I'm not sure I would use the word conservative, but certainly cautious and cognizant of the implications of using that funding.
 And the fact is, as you've heard me say several times, these are one-time funds and the ESSER funding will not last forever.
 And so we have to be mindful of the uses
 being taking care to not create unnecessary structural deficits, and at the same time, making sure that we're being responsive to the urgent needs of students.
 And so where we strike that equilibrium is a big part of the conversations that we have been having and that we will be having.
 So I'm going to pause for one second before we move on to buildings and grounds and just talk a little bit about what you'll see over the next couple of slides in this, but I'm glad that I flashed to it quickly so that I can tell
 Mr. McLaughlin that he's on next as I continue to babble for another minute or so.
 But the departments that you're seeing starting with buildings, we're going to start with buildings and grounds and then move to the more umbrella offices of the superintendent's office and the office of finance and operations.
 And if you think back to the organizational chart that we saw at the beginning of the presentation, you can see that for both myself and Dr. Edouard-Vincent, there are a lot of priorities and funding and strategic investments
 and proposals that cut across the different departments and offices that you've already heard from.
 And that's a good thing because what we don't want to do is present a budget to you in the form of 25 siloed or overly departmentalized mini organizations.
 We want common themes and common strategic priorities that cut across.
 And so what you'll see in the bullets that we've identified are pieces that are either reflective of those priorities
 or operational pieces that are meant to put us in a position that we'll be able to actually pursue those priorities and do so successfully.
 Similar to the information technology budget proposals that we discussed in last night's committee of the whole, a large portion, arguably all, frankly, of the buildings and grounds priorities, the year maintenance issue,
 uh, that is essentially routine.
 I think routine was the word that we used in the technology presentation.
 That's something that we typically are going to incorporate one way or another into our operating budget.
 Um, something that is a one-time expense and I'm using the term one time in the context of municipal budgeting.
 And so one time could mean every 10 years, every 15 years, every 20 years, but certainly not on an annual basis.
 Um, that's every 20 years, but certainly not on an annual basis.
 That's something that we're going to look up to as a capital expense that we're going to try to keep off the operating budget for purposes of not creating some of those deficits that we've talked about.
 What we do when we have a large influx of federal funding, frankly, similar to how we handled the funding that came in during FY21, and to some extent in FY20 as well, is to try to address some of the most urgent priorities and needs that might in another context be considered a capital expense.
 but in light of the urgency, we're looking to just take what funding is available and make sure that that's addressed.
 That was certainly the case as is reflected in the buildings and grounds budget narrative that was provided to you today with regard to our HVAC repairs that we needed to expedite and accelerate at the beginning of this school year for purposes of getting students and staff back into the physical school buildings.
 And so I expressed my appreciation for Mr. McLaughlin and members of his team who partnered with
 the external experts that we brought in to make that a reality.
 The history as to how we got to the place where so much work was necessary, I think, has been addressed at length in previous meetings.
 But however we got here, we are in a much better position from an air quality perspective because that work was done throughout the course of this year.
 And now we're looking at some of the other heavy infrastructure pieces that may not land in the operating budget for FY22.
 but are critical priorities that need to be addressed in the near term.
 And I'm going to ask Mr. McLaughlin, if he could, to walk us through some of these.
 As we're talking about how these investments need to be made in the coming year or months.
 So John, do you want to take it from there and just start maybe with the generator and transformer electrical issues that we have
 been identified at the high school and at the Andrews and then we'll walk through some of the other pieces.
 From there we'll move on to finance operations in the superintendent's office and then we'll go to questions after that.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=1262.233s">[John McLaughlin]</a>: 出色地。
 我不知道。
 我已经激活了接入点。
 我，我，你知道，我为此准备了一段时间。
 不管怎样，所以，呃，是的，所以，呃，断路器或放大器，呃，反式，呃，断路器在安德鲁斯高中被更​​换了。
 所以我们回到了我们需要去的地方。
 嗯，它是，呃，我们对所有电气系统进行，嗯，安全，呃，检查，红外扫描的一部分。
 在高中，通过法学院，对不起。
 因此，我们能够用正常的运营预算来解决这个问题。
 所以我们知道，我们也知道应急发电机，它正准备出去进行 RFP。
 此外，变压器是梅德福高中原装设备。
 所以发生的事情是，是在什么时候，
 几年前我会有多氯联苯。
 所以我们必须去掉 PCB 并在上面涂上另一种油。
 最终发生的情况是橡胶密封件容易脱落。
 所以我正在获取报价。
 我有，今天刚收到，检查变压器。
 并确保我们能够回到我们需要去的地方。
 它的油量很低，但仍在运行，但它肯定是应该优先考虑的事情，因为它还运行着大约三分之一的功率。
 在梅德福高中。
 然后我们将准备好定价信息以继续推进。
 显然，这将是一个带有发电机的夏季项目，只要我们准备好承担该项目即可。
 今年我们进行了一些安全改进。
 我们有一个新的 Raptor 系统。
 当时我安装了所有显示器，并接受了新 Raptor 系统的培训。
 如果你不知道猛禽系统是你进来的地方，你给自己一个许可证，他们会扫描它。
 如果一切顺利，您将收到一个标签，并准备好前往总办公室办理您在我们任何学校需要办理的业务。
 因此，我们希望每三四年完成一次停车场。
 我应该说，通常是整个系统范围内的所有这些。
 停车场又被标记了，它们开始老化了。
 我们想做一些
 梅福德高中的调整，我们将就残疾人停车情况与该学校会面。
 我知道我们在谈论主入口时进行了这样的对话。
 我认为我们想要做的是搬到梅福德高中前面的残疾人专用点，并进入那里的残疾人坡道。
 所以，你知道，让我们回顾一下。
 我和
 Lungo-Koehn 市长上周表示，如果我需要帮助，我们在市政厅有交通部门，他们会非常乐意帮助我们。
 几年前，我们与他们会面，试图做出一些改进，但众所周知，过去的一年并不是我们通常处理的典型年份。
 柯蒂斯塔夫茨锅炉项目，所以去年冬天，锅炉开始泄漏。
 这些都是我们可能会在下周的小组委员会会议上讨论的问题。
 这就是为什么我们订购了一些需要重新安装的部件，即分段部件。
 因此，我们得到了两个部分，他们将更换它们，这应该可以阻止我们预期的泄漏。
 我们将不得不在这方面花费大量资金。
 和暖通空调的改进。
 所以我们知道我们做了很多这样的事情。
 我们目前正在打开空调。
 因此，存在与此相关的问题，某些特定区域需要我们聘请承包商来修复。
 根据法律规定，我们必须在 5 月 15 日之前提供供暖。
 所以这周是我们进行结算的一周。
 不幸的是，本周很热，你知道，这很愚蠢，但这周很热。
 教室里的一些老师感到有点不舒服，但我们正在努力解决。
 我们知道你在那里。
 我们将尽快出去处理所有需要做的事情。
 致电承包商。
 我只是想列出一份我们需要做的事情以及需要做的建筑物的清单。
 嗯，浴室改造项目。
 戴夫和我会见了建筑师。
 嗯，我想我们只是在等待获得许可来查看并制作该项目的 RFP。
 是，我知道这是一个，嗯，
 梅福德高中项目对于改善浴室的许多人来说都是很亲近的。
 我们想要它，我知道。
 市长让我们看看我们能生产多少。
 我想如果我们能得到一个价格，我们就会知道我们在哪里，然后我们就可以从那里走得尽可能远。
 我们仍在等待主入口修复工程。
 看看我们要做什么。
 我们的一个在清洁办公室工作的人是一名瓦工，所以他主动提出出去尝试修复一点墙壁，花岗岩墙。
 所以今天他在那里工作。
 我的意思是，我希望我能让它看起来更好一点，但它仍然会
 什么，是什么，所以你知道我们当然可以在主入口见面，我想我们将在下周和小组委员会讨论并讨论我们希望如何推进这一点。
 这就是为什么我每年都会在预算范围内订购一辆带犁的卡车。
 所以这并没有改变。
 这肯定会对降雪有所帮助，也肯定会对整个地区的其他杂项项目有所帮助。
 如果我们有一辆带犁的卡车。
 所以，你知道，我可以多次帮助 DPW，因为他们行动非常迅速。
 而且，你知道，有时有些区域需要修补，但他们无法返回，因为主要目标是城市周围的道路。
 因此，拥有这样的东西肯定会有助于提高效率。
 由我们处置，接机。
 现在，我想，现在的剧院正在翻修，如果你看到我的预算前报告的话。
 如果我有一个希望看到成果的项目，那就是添加空调、栏杆、更新门以及在剧院进行一些电气工作。
 几年前我得到了一个价格，现在的价格不同了：在剧院的天花板上加装一台空调需要 10 万美元。
 我认为这对社区也有好处。
 也为学校创造收入，也许在某个时候将其添加到我们的资本改进清单中。
 但是，就像我说的，如果我可以选择我想做的高中项目，那将是我的主要项目之一，即改造项目。
 我们一直致力于学校的暖通空调改进项目。
 你知道，在某些时候，也许我们可以从 MSBA 获得帮助，也许我们可以添加空调以及梅福德高中目前没有空调的其他部分，这意味着科学实验室是建筑物中唯一有空调的真正部分。
 服务，你知道，除了我们到处都有的窗式空调。
 所以看不到底部。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=2280.431s">[David Murphy]</a>: 谢谢你，博士。
 然后去财务和运营办公室。
 正如您所看到的，这里有一些不同点。
 我将重点关注三个方面，包括交通，我认为它有自己的幻灯片，而且确实如此，谢谢。
 但首先，前两个，这是在昨晚的演讲中提到的。
 我认为这是在英语学习部门确定的优先事项的背景下发生的。
 想要投资一个机会来发展我们的努力，主要是我们的家庭承诺和社区关系。
 我当时指出，我们没有确定 22 财年对 EL 部门的具体投资的部分原因是我们从该地区获得了一项投资，我们希望能够推动这一事业，我们将为此努力。
 与 EL 部门、卫生服务部门、特殊教育部门等密切合作。
 我认为，当我们考虑如何构建组织以及如何组织特定的工作组合时，作为一般规则，最佳实践是确定需求，确定正在满足的需求或由于其他变化变量而正在发展的需求，
 然后确定如何最好地开发适合组织结构的角色和组合，以促进这些目标。
 然而，有时会出现多种事件同时发生的情况，我们的领导人员具有可用的能力和不断出现且变得更加紧迫的需求。
 这种融合发生在整个学年。
 老实说，引起我们注意的方式之一是当我们需要将整个行政部门转移到学校担任代课教师时。
 当我们清楚地意识到这令人筋疲力尽且几乎不可能时，我们试图做出不同的修改，我们的课前和课后规划主任继续自愿承担这项工作，并继续与我们沟通，就像她一段时间以来所做的那样，她觉得
 他的投资组合中有空间容纳额外的责任和信心类型，以及我们作为经理和领导者所拥有的个人能力。
 事实上，我们能够度过本学年，但通过能够确定我们可以在父母和家庭参与领域改进和更好地工作的做法，
 我指望黛安·考德威尔（Diane Caldwell）的帮助，她是我们的前副总监，曾担任家长信息中心的高级主任。
 我要说的是，作为一个新来这个学区的人，我在第一周继承了家长信息中心作为我的投资组合的一部分，没有夫人。
 考德威尔，
 如果能够提供这种领导力、指导和机构知识，这将是更具挑战性的一年，不仅是在对 PIC 的监督方面，而且在我和其他高级管理人员负责的工作的几乎所有其他要素方面。
 但我们从一开始就知道，
 考德威尔担任家长信息中心的管理员并不是一个永久的解决方案，他试图在内部运作
 在我们的预算范围内，我们不一定打算为家长信息中心主任作为一个没有其他职责的单一职位提供资金。
 然后是夫人。
 Fidler 表达了承担额外责任的意愿和热情。
 我们认为家长信息中心与贫困学校和缺勤学校计划之间有着紧密的自然联系，以及额外的支持
 呃，我们需要的能力，嗯，我们需要在家庭关系、交通方面的能力。
 嗯，我们认为这适合作为一个合法的、全面的管理组合。
 因此，作为 22 财年预算的一部分，我们建议将这些办公室重组为一般家庭参与区域，其中包括对家长信息中心的监督、对课前和课后计划的持续监督。
 以及交通连接等服务。
 现在，坦率地说，所有这些角色组合在一起的原因之一是它们是学年的不同部分，需要更大程度的关注和细节。
 这就是为什么我说这是一种融合，因为它非常适合与已经具备机构知识的人一起创建一个完整的 12 个月的角色。
 并在过去为该地区做出了出色的工作。
 这就是为什么能够有效地做到这一点，同时也对如何更有效地推进学区围绕家庭和社区伙伴关系的目标充满信心，是制定该提案的一部分。
 所以这是一场戏。
 然后你会看到，正如昨晚也提到的，
 我们设立了赠款协调员职位。
 这本身是一个非预算的事情，它不一定会对运营预算和赠款产生影响，这个人基本上一直担任非官方赠款协调员一段时间，但从技术上讲，在行政助理的角色中，我们已经能够将该人调到财务和运营办公室，与米歇尔·金登和她的团队合作，以确保我们
 履行我们的所有义务并尽可能有效地从合规角度执行。
 这是不同的，我想强调这一点。
 这当然与我们目前没有的拨款写作角色不同，但我们正在探索其他方法来释放一些能力，让管理员有机会更好地培养外部合作伙伴关系和
 并寻找赠款机会，以便我们的赠款协调员能够帮助协调并尝试以这种方式释放额外的预算能力。
 在我们谈论交通之前，我想再说一遍，这是我们昨晚谈话的延续。
 在本学年中，我们继续与 Management Solution 和 Paquette 先生保持合作关系，Paquette 先生担任临时代理
 夫人之间的业务管理员
 帕特森和我。
 我们已准备好委托提交给学校委员会的报告。
 基本上，我要求对报告进行附录，因为该报告是在整个学年中准备的，并在某种程度上促进了预算制定过程。
 我问帕克特先生，根据我们仍然拥有的预付款，
 基本上，您可以填写一些补充内容，其中会考虑到我们所做的一些更改，夫人。
 Kimu 和我在过去的几个月里将这一点付诸实践。
 这就是为什么我预计在本财年结束之前将其提交给委员会。
 然后，帕克特先生，我们与塔夫茨大学的合作伙伴关系，一开始只是测试合作伙伴关系，后来发展为对话。
 在技​​术基础设施的背景下，我希望我们整个夏天都能非常有效地从中受益。
 但随后我们还将探讨在展望 2022 财年时我们应该保留或可能参考的其他外部知识。
 这是一个高层次的概述。
 我将结束交通，然后继续回答您的问题。
 如果您还记得当我们谈论 22 财年的预测时，我们的成本增加了约 51,000。
 我必须快速地说，这些是因为它们是在 5 月 6 日解决的。
 这些与我们与特殊教育相关的固定交通成本无关。
 这是我们的主要供应商东方巴士。
 学校委员会于 2020 年春季签订了一份为期三年的新合同。
 所以，我们正在完成其中的第一个。
 的三年合同。
 与合同一样，成本逐年增加。
 因此，我们预计该合同将增加约 51,000 美元，作为我们预计固定成本增加 210 万美元的一部分。
 4 月 26 日，当提出有关 MBTA 通行证的请求时，您已经看到了以下两个数字。
 这本质上是我们的一个选择
 确保委员会知道。
 然后还有一些问题，涉及额外黄色巴士的基本成本以及在高中提供额外东区巴士容量的可能性。
 我们估计约为 75,000 美元。
 我之所以说它是零到 75,000 美元，是因为在我们与供应商的对话中，他们有，
 我认为，并且我很欣赏这一点，我不知道是否所有提供商都会这样做，但他们建议，根据本学年之前该学区采用的半径，就初中和高中交通而言，有可能重新调整我们现有的一些能力，以提供至少一辆额外的巴士到高中。
 下周我们将与
 巴士提供商以及梅德福警察局，我们将在那里讨论一系列问题，既与安全有关，也与规划即将到来的夏季学年的路线和站点的开发有关。
 所以，坦率地说，我目前没有向委员会提出关于是否应该增加第二辆公共汽车的任何建议。
 我认为很明显我们可以做到这一点。
 所以我认为问题在于查看有关哪里的数据
 什么是高中生以及是否有需求。
 我要说的是，在我与中等教育管理部门的简短对话中，我们根本不清楚是否知道对此有明确的需求，但我认为我们要牢记这一点。
 但与此同时，如果为学生提供更方便的服务的成本在 0 到 75,000 美元之间，那么显然我们会考虑这一点。
 我认为从战略角度来看，我们需要牢记 MBTA 通行证显然有可能提供更多的准入机会。
 而且，你知道，你开始考虑学生工作、去城市的机会。
 城市还有其他类型的体验，例如 MBTA 通行证可以为学生提供的课堂和体验式学习体验。
 我们正在考虑所有这些选择。
 贯穿所有演示的一个共同点是，我们决心在 21-22 学年为学生建立有效的延长上课日和课外活动计划，利用 ESSER 资金确保我们在学生面临重大干扰后提供尽可能最大的恢复支持。
 因此，我感谢您抽出时间并在这方面给予我宽容。
 如果你喜欢我可以提供更多证词和证人的演示，我保证我也更喜欢它们。
 但这些是建筑物和土地、财务和运营办公室以及主管办公室的记录。
 此时，我将很乐意回答您的问题。</p>

 យើងមានចិត្តល្អខ្លាំងណាស់ក្នុងការឧបត្ថម្ភការធ្វើដំណើរដែលទាក់ទងនឹងកីឡាដែលសមាជិកក្រុមតន្រ្តីត្រូវលក់អ្វីៗគ្រប់យ៉ាងដែលពួកគេមានជាកម្មសិទ្ធិក្នុងការធ្វើដំណើរតាមឡានក្រុង។
 នេះគឺជាថវិកាទីបួនរបស់ខ្ញុំ។
 កាលពីបួនឆ្នាំមុនខ្ញុំមិនមែនជាមនុស្សតែម្នាក់ដែលបាននិយាយនោះទេ
 យើងត្រូវការព័ត៌មានលម្អិតអំពីចំនួនសិស្សម្នាក់ៗចំណាយលើសកម្មភាពក្រៅសាលា។
 ព្រោះខ្ញុំទុកចិត្តវិចារណញាណរបស់ខ្ញុំខ្ញុំមិនមានកូនហាត់ប្រាណជាមួយទេ។
 ខ្ញុំមានកូននៅក្នុងក្រុមតន្រ្តីនេះ។
 ខ្ញុំមិនចាប់អារម្មណ៍ក្នុងការធ្វើសេចក្តីថ្លែងការណ៍ឬការផ្តល់យោបល់អំពីការផ្លាស់ប្តូរគោលនយោបាយដោយគ្មានទិន្នន័យ។
 ប៉ុន្តែអារម្មណ៍របស់ខ្ញុំនៅពេលដែលខ្ញុំបានឃើញកាបូបហាត់ប្រាណ
 វាមានភាពខុសគ្នាមួយចំនួនរវាងការបង្វឹកនិងការគ្រប់គ្រងក្រុមតន្រ្តីហើយសំណងផ្សេងទៀតនៅក្នុងកិច្ចសន្យារបស់យើងអាចសមស្របដោយផ្អែកលើម៉ោងដែលបានផ្តល់ប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំគ្មានវិធីដឹងទេ។
 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំពិតជាឆ្ងល់ថាតើយើងកំពុងអនុគ្រោះកុមារដែលសម្រេចចិត្តលេងកីឡាហើយដែលបានដាក់បន្ទុកគ្រួសាររបស់ពួកគេដើម្បីទទួលបានប្រាក់ដឹកជញ្ជូន។
 ខ្ញុំទើបតែយកឧទាហរណ៍ទាំងពីរនេះដើម្បីប្រៀបធៀបជាមួយកុមារក្នុងក្រុម។
 ខ្ញុំប្រាកដថាមានអ្នកផ្សេងទៀត។
 ដូច្នេះការវិលត្រឡប់ល្អប្រសើរជាងគ្មានការវិលថយក្រោយប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំគ្មានវិធីដឹងថាតើវាត្រឹមត្រូវទេ។
 នេះគឺសំខាន់ណាស់សម្រាប់ខ្ញុំ។
 នេះគឺជាថវិកាទី 4 ដែលមានបញ្ហានេះ។
 ឆ្នាំទីបួនខ្ញុំចង់បានវាខ្ញុំដឹងថាអ្នកមិនមានថវិកាគ្រប់គ្រាន់ក្នុងរយៈពេល 3 ឆ្នាំចុងក្រោយនេះទេ។
 ដូច្នេះអ្នកដឹងទេតើយើងចំណាយប៉ុន្មានសម្រាប់និស្សិត?
 ខ្ញុំចង់មានន័យថារួមទាំងប្រាក់ខែចំពោះកិច្ចសន្យារបស់គ្រូ។
 ខ្ញុំចង់និយាយថាលុយទាំងអស់ដែលយើងចំណាយលើការអប់រំដែលផ្ទុយពី K-8, តើយើងចំណាយប្រាក់ប៉ុន្មាន?
 តើគាត់ទៅណា?
 តើវាពិតជាយុត្តិធម៌ទេ?
 ខ្ញុំចង់មានន័យថាព្រោះខ្ញុំដឹងថាកីឡាមានសារៈសំខាន់ចំពោះមនុស្សជាច្រើន
 ការហាមឃាត់នេះមានសារៈសំខាន់ណាស់សម្រាប់មនុស្សជាច្រើន។
 ខ្ញុំពិតជាគិតថាយើងត្រូវតែឈានដល់បាតនេះ។
 ខ្ញុំមិនគិតថានោះជាអ្វីដែលយើងអាចដោះស្រាយនៅយប់នេះបានទេ។
 គួរឱ្យភ្ញាក់ផ្អើលខ្ញុំពិតជាមិនដឹងថាតើបញ្ហានេះត្រូវបានដោះស្រាយឬអត់នោះទេ។
 ប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំពិតជាបានកត់សម្គាល់ឃើញថាអ្នកមិនមានថវិកាបីចុងក្រោយទេ។

 ខ្ញុំចង់និយាយថាពេលខ្លះមានភាពខុសគ្នាខុសគ្នា។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាភាគច្រើន
 ភាពខុសគ្នានេះបានកើតឡើងរវាងតំបន់ដោយសារតែប្រព័ន្ធសន្តិភាពដែលមាននៅជុំវិញអត្តពលកម្ម។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថានោះហើយជាមូលហេតុដែលអ្នកឃើញភាពខុសគ្នានេះជាញឹកញាប់ប៉ុន្តែពួកគេដើរតួនាទីស្រដៀងនឹងផ្នែកនៃកម្មវិធីអប់រំរបស់យើងដែលទាក់ទាញសិស្សនិងឱ្យពួកគេមកនៅទីនេះដោយនិយាយដោយត្រង់ទៅហើយដោយរីករាយនិងទទួលបានអត្ថប្រយោជន៍ច្រើនបំផុតពីការអប់រំរបស់ពួកគេ។
 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំរីករាយក្នុងការស៊ើបអង្កេតរឿងនេះហើយមើលថាតើមានដែរឬទេ

 ជាថ្មីម្តងទៀតនេះគឺជាឆ្នាំទីបួនរបស់ខ្ញុំហើយនៅឆ្នាំទី 4 របស់និស្សិតដែលព្យាយាមរកវិធីដើម្បីផ្តល់នូវផលិតផលមករដូវដល់សិស្សរបស់យើង។
 តើអ្វីជាការអាម៉ាស់មួយ។
 ខ្ញុំមិនស្គាល់មនុស្សគ្រប់គ្នានៅក្នុងកិច្ចប្រជុំនេះយល់ស្របទេប៉ុន្តែវាពិបាកណាស់។
 គម្រោង CCSR កំពុងធ្វើការរយៈពេល 4 ឆ្នាំជាប់គ្នាដើម្បីធានាថានិស្សិតដែលមានរដូវមិនមានការលំបាកក្នុងការទទួលបានផលិតផលទាំងនេះ។
 វាគួរឱ្យចាប់អារម្មណ៍ណាស់។
 ខ្ញុំគ្រាន់តែចង់បញ្ជាក់ឱ្យច្បាស់ថាខ្ញុំមិនបោះឆ្នោតសម្រាប់នរណាម្នាក់ទេ

 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំមិនប្រាកដថាខ្ញុំមានព័ត៌មានត្រឹមត្រូវឬអត់។
 លោក Murphy ខ្ញុំមិនមានព័ត៌មានអំពីស្ថានភាពដែលអ្នកបានលើកឡើងនោះទេ។
 ខ្ញុំមិនចាំពីការប្រជុំណាមួយអំពីរឿងនោះទេ។
 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំគ្រាន់តែចង់និយាយពីរឿងនោះ។
 ខ្ញុំស្គាល់អ្នក

 ប្រសិនបើមាននរណាម្នាក់មិត្តរួមការងាររបស់ខ្ញុំចង់ចែករំលែកការចងចាំរបស់ពួកគេសូមកុំធ្វើ។
 ប៉ុន្តែដូចដែលខ្ញុំបានពន្យល់នៅពេលដែលគណៈកម្មាធិការត្រូវបានកំណត់កាំ 2,0 ម៉ាយល៍
 ខ្ញុំដឹងថានេះគឺសម្រាប់វិទ្យាល័យ។
 ជាថ្មីម្តងទៀតមានដែនកំណត់ចំពោះបញ្ហានេះដូចដែលខ្ញុំបានក្លាយជាខ្ញុំគិតថានៅសាលាខ្ញុំត្រូវបានបង្រៀនអំពីមួយម៉ាយល៍កន្លះប៉ុន្តែវាមិនត្រូវបានអនុវត្តទេ។

 ដោយវិធីនេះខ្ញុំត្រូវតែនិយាយថានេះមិនអនុវត្តចំពោះមត្តេយ្យទេ។
 ដូច្នេះការលើកលែងគឺជាការលើកលែងសុវត្ថិភាពសម្រាប់អ្នកមណ្ឌខ័ណ្ឌមត្តេយ្យនិងនិស្សិតពិការភាពនិងការដឹកជញ្ជូនក្នុងផែនការអប់រំបុគ្គលដែលជាការពិតក៏មិនពាក់ព័ន្ធនឹងការសន្ទនានេះដែរ។

 ដូចខ្ញុំបាននិយាយនេះអាចមានសេរីភាព។
 តាមទ្រឹស្តីនេះអាចជាអព្យាក្រឹតថវិកា។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាលើសពីនេះវាអាចមានឡានក្រុងលឿងច្រើនជាងមួយហើយបន្ទាប់មកវាអាចមានឡានក្រុងផ្សេងទៀតប៉ុន្តែមួយដែលប្រាកដជាមានផលប៉ះពាល់ខ្លះលើថវិកា។
 ហើយបញ្ហាមួយទៀតដែលខ្ញុំគិតថាយើងត្រូវដោះស្រាយគឺថានឹងមាននិស្សិតដែលចង់បានការបញ្ចុះតម្លៃ MBTA ឆ្លងកាត់។
 ខ្ញុំមិនទទួលយកញត្តិស្នើឱ្យសហរដ្ឋអាមេរិកបញ្ចប់ភាពជាដៃគូរបស់យើងជាមួយ MBTA ហើយឈប់ផ្តល់ជូន MBTA ឆ្លងកាត់ទេពីព្រោះប្រសិនបើនិស្សិតណាម្នាក់ចង់ទិញលិខិតឆ្លងដែនដោយហេតុផលណាមួយ
 យើងពិតជាចង់អោយសិស្សរបស់យើងអាចទទួលបានកាតបញ្ចុះតម្លៃដូចសិស្សនៅស្រុកសាលាផ្សេងទៀត។
 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំគិតថាយើងនឹងបន្តកម្មវិធីនេះប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំគិតថាជាមូលដ្ឋានយើងគ្រាន់តែត្រូវការពិនិត្យមើលថាតើនិស្សិតកំពុងប្រើសន្លឹកបៀរ។
 ដូច្នេះប្រសិនបើពួកគេពឹងផ្អែកលើវាយើងត្រូវបង់ប្រាក់សម្រាប់ MBTA Pass ឬផ្តល់ជម្រើសជំនួសសិស្សដើម្បីទៅសាលារៀន។
 ឥឡូវខ្ញុំចង់
 វាទាំងអស់គឺអាស្រ័យលើចំនួនសំបុត្រដែលយើងលក់និងចំនួនសិស្សទិញពួកគេដោយផ្អែកលើពួកគេ។
 ដូច្នេះតើផ្លូវមួយណាដែលជាឡានក្រុងលឿង?
 ពិតជាមានច្រើនស្រទាប់ក្នុងការនេះប៉ុន្តែវាពិតជាមានការណែនាំច្បាស់លាស់ពីគណៈកម្មការ។
 ប្រសិនបើយើងមានបញ្ហាក្នុងការប្រតិបត្តិមិនថាមកពីទស្សនៈថវិកាឬខាងដឹកនាំសាស្ត្រក៏ដោយយើងនឹងត្រឡប់មកវិញ។
 សម្រាប់ខ្ញុំវាអាចមានក្រុមនិស្សិតមួយក្រុម
 នៅពេលដែលយើងនិយាយថាមិនអីទេអ្នកទិញកាតនេះពីព្រោះអ្នកត្រូវការវាសម្រាប់សាលារៀនពីព្រោះអ្នកត្រូវការវាសម្រាប់ការងារពីព្រោះអ្នកគ្រាន់តែចង់បានកាត MBTA ដែលបានបញ្ចុះ។
 ពួកគេនឹងនិយាយថាស្តាប់បុរសខ្ញុំគ្រាន់តែចង់បានលិខិតឆ្លងដែនប៉ុណ្ណោះ។
 នេះជា 30 ដុល្លាររបស់ខ្ញុំ។
 ខ្ញុំនឹងព្រួយបារម្ភអំពីការទៅសាលារៀន។
 ត្រង់ចំណុចនេះខ្ញុំមិនគិតថាយើងកំពុងរំលោភគោលនយោបាយទេ។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាយើងបានរកឃើញនិស្សិតម្នាក់ដែលបានសំរេចចិត្តយក MBTA ហើយទៅថ្នាក់ដោយមិនគិតពីថាតើគាត់នៅពេលវេលាឬអត់។
 ជាថ្មីម្តងទៀតខ្ញុំគិតថាចេតនាគឺច្បាស់ណាស់។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាយើងនឹងធ្វើអ្វីគ្រប់យ៉ាងដែលយើងអាចធ្វើបានដើម្បីពង្រឹងវា។
 ប្រសិនបើយើងរកឃើញខ្លួនយើងនៅក្នុងស្ថានភាពដែលវាមិនអាចធ្វើបានធម្មតាមិនអាចធ្វើទៅបានពីទស្សនៈថវិកាឬដោយមានទស្សនៈវិស័យក៏ដោយយើងនឹងត្រូវរក្សាការសន្ទនាបើកចំហជាមួយគណៈកម្មការ។
 ប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំពិតជាយល់ពីចេតនា។
 ដូចខ្ញុំបាននិយាយថាយើងនឹងព្យាយាមឱ្យអស់ពីសមត្ថភាពដើម្បីធ្វើវា។</p>

 នេះគឺជាកំឡុងពេលដែលមានរយៈពេលរហូតដល់ថ្ងៃទី 1 ខែសីហា។
 បើនិយាយពីភាពជាក់លាក់តើ MBTA បានឆ្លងកាត់ដោយឥតគិតថ្លៃសម្រាប់មនុស្សគ្រប់គ្នាឬមានយុទ្ធសាស្ត្រឡានក្រុងលឿងហើយនោះគឺជាអ្វីដែលយើងកំពុងផ្លាស់ប្តូរ?
 នៅក្នុងកាំមួយទៅពីរម៉ាយល៍ទាំងអស់នេះច្បាស់ជាជះឥទ្ធិពលដល់ថវិកាក៏ដូចជាអ្វីៗដែលបានកើតឡើងនៅស្រុកសាលារៀនបន្ទាប់ពីថវិកាត្រូវបានអនុម័ត។
 ប៉ុន្តែថវិកាត្រូវតែឆ្លុះបញ្ចាំងពីលទ្ធភាពដែលអនុញ្ញាតឱ្យយើងទៅសាលារៀនដោយមិនតម្រូវឱ្យនិស្សិតបង់ប្រាក់។

 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំគិតថាយើងត្រូវប្រមូលទិន្នន័យនៅលើកាត។
 តើកាតដែលបានប្រើដោយផ្អែកលើចំណូលចិត្តឬត្រូវបានទិញបន្ថែមទៀតដោយផ្អែកលើចំណង់ចំណូលចិត្តឬកង្វះចំណូលចិត្ត?

 ខ្ញុំគិតថានោះជាអ្វីដែលអ្នកចង់និយាយហើយអ្នកចង់បញ្ជាក់ព្រោះខ្ញុំស្រមៃមើលនិស្សិតអាជីពត្រូវបាននាំចូលទៅក្នុងវិស័យនេះគឺអ្នកស្ម័គ្រចិត្ត CCSR និងអ្វីៗទាំងអស់នោះ។
 ដូច្នេះវាគួរឱ្យចាប់អារម្មណ៍ក្នុងការមើលថាតើឱកាសនៃកម្មវិធីមានអ្វីកើតឡើងនៅពេលយើងគិតអំពីការវិភាគថ្លៃដើមនៃជំរើសផ្សេងៗគ្នា។
 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំដឹងថាយើងមិនត្រឹមតែមានឡានក្រុងតំរង់ទិសប៉ុណ្ណោះទេប៉ុន្តែយើងក៏មានអ្នកផ្តល់សេវាដឹកជញ្ជូនផងដែរ។
 យើងមានអ្នកផ្តល់សេវាដឹកជញ្ជូនជាច្រើនហើយមានបញ្ហាខ្លះរវាងពួកគេ។
 ដោយផ្ទាល់យើងមានបញ្ហាមួយចំនួនជាមួយនឹងអ្នកផ្តល់សេវាដឹកជញ្ជូនរបស់យើងហើយខ្ញុំដឹងថាវាពិបាកក្នុងការរក្សាឬរក្សានិយោជិក។
 ជាពិសេសនៅក្នុងស្ថានភាពបច្ចុប្បន្ន។
 ប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំឆ្ងល់ថាតើមានឱកាសកណ្តាលឬស្ទើរតែដូចដំណោះស្រាយចុច C-Clash ដែរឬទេ?
 អ្វីដែលអ្នកលក់ផ្តល់ជូនមិនមានភាពស៊ីសង្វាក់គ្នាសូម្បីតែនៅក្នុងកិច្ចព្រមព្រៀងមួយចំនួនដែលខ្ញុំបានឃើញ។
 តើវាមិនអីទេសម្រាប់ឪពុកម្តាយរបស់អ្នកត្រលប់មកផ្ទះវិញដោយមានលិខិតនិយាយថាប្រសិនបើអ្នកខកខានឡានក្រុងនៅពេលព្រឹកពួកគេនឹងមិនមកយកអ្នកនៅពេលរសៀលទេ?
 អ្នកមិនអាចធ្វើបានទេ។
 ប៉ុន្តែនេះគឺជាមធ្យោបាយធ្វើដំណើរសម្រាប់ការអប់រំពិសេស។
 ប៉ុន្តែនេះគឺជាផែនទីជាក់លាក់ដែលយើងបានឃើញ។
 នោះហើយជាអ្វីដែលខ្ញុំកំពុងនិយាយ។
 ចាំបាច់ត្រូវមានភាពស្ថិតស្ថេរក្នុងកិច្ចសន្យាថវិកានិងគុណភាពនៃការទាមទារសំណង។
 ហេតុអ្វីត្រូវហើយ?
 រដ្ឋបាលម្នាក់បានស្តាប់ពាក្យបណ្តឹងអំពីនាយកដ្ឋានមួយនិងអ្នកគ្រប់គ្រងម្នាក់ទៀតស្តាប់ពាក្យបណ្តឹងអំពីនាយកដ្ឋានមួយផ្សេងទៀតដូច្នេះកាកសំណល់កណ្តាលនេះគឺថាតើគណៈកម្មាធិការសាលាយល់ពីអ្វីដែលសមស្របទៅនឹងការសមហេតុផល។</p>

 McLaughlin និងខ្ញុំដូចដែលយើងបាននិយាយនៅពេលចាប់ផ្តើមនៃការធ្វើបទបង្ហាញនេះគឺជាហេតុផលដ៏សំខាន់មួយដែលធ្វើឱ្យយើងចង់រៀបចំរចនាសម្ព័ន្ធការជួលរបស់បុគ្គលសំខាន់ដែលបានឧទ្ទិសដល់ក្រុមគ្រួសារ។

 ពេលខ្លះយើងលឺអំពីវាប៉ុន្តែមានភាពចម្រូងចម្រាស
 អ្នកដឹងទេនេះគឺជារឿងរបស់អ្វីដែលពិតជាបានកើតឡើង។
 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំមិនចង់ណែនាំថាដោយរៀបចំការិយាល័យទាំងនេះឡើងវិញតាមរបៀបណាមួយបញ្ហាបន្ថែមនឹងមិនមានកើតឡើងទេពីព្រោះអ្នកដឹងទេនោះគឺជាការពិត។
 ទោះយ៉ាងណាក្នុងពេលជាមួយគ្នានេះយើងរំពឹងថាការិយាល័យចូលរួមក្នុងគ្រួសារនឹងបម្រើជាអ្នកសម្របសម្រួលកណ្តាលតាមរបៀបជាច្រើនរវាងការិយាល័យដែលមានទំនាក់ទំនងផ្ទាល់និងញឹកញាប់ជាង។
 ការប្រាស្រ័យទាក់ទងជាមួយក្រុមគ្រួសាររួមទាំងកម្មវិធីថែទាំខ្លះមុននិងក្រោយពេលចូលរៀននៅពេលចូលក្នុងសហគមន៍សេវាកម្មសុខភាព (ជាកន្លែងដែលការអប់រំពិសេសនៃការដឹកជញ្ជូននេះគឺជាផ្នែកមួយដ៏ធំធេងព្រោះគ្រួសារនិងឪពុកម្តាយក្នុងបរិយាកាសបង្រៀន។
 បញ្ហាដឹកជញ្ជូននៃប្រតិបត្តិការមូលដ្ឋានទាំងនេះមួយចំនួនដូច្នេះត្រូវនិយាយគឺជាបញ្ហាដែលក្រុមគ្រួសារពឹងផ្អែកកាន់តែខ្លាំងទៅលើការិយាល័យទាំងនេះខ្ញុំគិតថានឹងមានប្រយោជន៍ពីទស្សនៈទំនាក់ទំនងហើយត្រូវដឹងអំពីបញ្ហាមួយចំនួនដែលត្រូវបានជូនដំណឹងយ៉ាងឆាប់រហ័ស។
 ដូច្នេះ, សមាជិកសភា McLaughlin, រឿងតែមួយគត់ដែលខ្ញុំមិនយល់ស្របនឹងការអត្ថាធិប្បាយរបស់អ្នកគឺ,
 វាត្រូវបានណែនាំថាគ្មានអ្នកផ្គត់ផ្គង់សនខុសត្រូវណាមួយឡើយ។
 ការទទួលខុសត្រូវអាចកើតឡើងតាមវិធីផ្សេងៗគ្នាហើយពេលខ្លះលើសពេលវេលាជាច្រើន។
 ប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំនឹងនិយាយថាខណៈដែលរដ្ឋាភិបាលនិងជាការពិតលោកស្រីគ្លីនតុន។

 អភិបាលក្រុងខ្ញុំសូមឱ្យខ្ញុំកាន់តែច្បាស់ព្រឹទ្ធបុរសនៃសេវាកម្មនិស្សិតគឺសាទរប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំក៏ខ្លាំងដែរ។
 ខ្ញុំគិតអំពីមនុស្សដែលមិនបានធ្វើវានិងរបៀបដែលពួកគេបានដោះស្រាយជាមួយវានិងរបៀបដែលពួកគេបានបង្ហាញថាការដឹកជញ្ជូនកំពុងធ្វើការ។
 និយាយដោយស្មោះត្រង់ខ្ញុំគិតថាវាត្រូវធ្វើជាមួយការប្រមូលទិន្នន័យ។
 ក៏មានរបស់ដូចក្មេងៗទៅសាលារៀនយឺតដែរ។
 ប៉ុន្តែជាថ្មីម្តងទៀតខ្ញុំគិតថាវាចាំបាច់ក្នុងការផ្តោតអារម្មណ៍ទៅលើអ្នកផ្គត់ផ្គង់របស់យើង។
 ចុងបញ្ចប់ខ្ញុំចង់សរសើរអ្នកត្រួតពិនិត្យឱ្យបានការដឹកនាំរបស់នាងឆ្ពោះទៅរកការអភិវឌ្ឍជំនាញវិជ្ជាជីវៈនិងគោលដៅអភិវឌ្ឍន៍វិជ្ជាជីវៈជុំវិញភាពលំអៀងជាក់ស្តែងនិងការសិក្សាបែបសង្គម។

 មួយក្នុងចំណោមពួកគេគឺ
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាបុគ្គលិកអាជីពមួយចំនួនមិនចាំបាច់មានអារម្មណ៍ថាមានការអភិវឌ្ឍជំនាញជាក់លាក់អ្នកដឹងទេអាជ្ញាប័ណ្ណជាក់លាក់ឬតម្រូវការដូច្នេះខ្ញុំចង់ដោះស្រាយរឿងនោះ។
 អ្នកដឹងទេគ្រាន់តែការព្រួយបារម្ភអំពីការធានាការចូលរួមនិងការអភិវឌ្ឍវិជ្ជាជីវៈរបស់អ្នកដែលមានសារៈសំខាន់ណាស់សម្រាប់ការរៀនសូត្រនេះពិតជាផ្នែកមួយនៃការរៀនសូត្រប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំគិតថាមានមនុស្សជាច្រើនដែលគ្រូបានបាត់បង់។
 ពួកគេគឺជាសាស្រ្តាចារ្យដែលមានទំនាក់ទំនងល្អ។ តាមដែលខ្ញុំដឹងអ្នកក៏ដឹងដែរ។
 ប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំគិតថាវាក៏អស្ចារ្យផងដែរដែលអាចផ្តល់ឱ្យប្រជាជននូវជម្រើសនៃការបត់បែននិងការអភិវឌ្ឍអាជីពមួយចំនួន។
 ដូច្នេះនោះមិនមែនជាអ្វីដែលខ្ញុំកំពុងរំពឹងចម្លើយសម្រាប់យប់នេះទេប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំគ្រាន់តែចង់និយាយពីពួកគេដូច្នេះអ្នកដឹងទេ។

 ខ្ញុំដឹងថាយើងបានឆ្លងកាត់សេចក្តីសម្រេចលើផែនការដឹកជញ្ជូន។
 ធំឡើងខ្ញុំត្រូវដើរមួយម៉ាយទៅចំណតឡានក្រុងរាល់ថ្ងៃ។
 ប្រសិនបើខ្ញុំនឹកឡានក្រុងខ្ញុំនឹងត្រូវដើរ 4 ម៉ោងនិង 29 នាទីដើម្បីទៅសាលារៀន។
 វាមើលទៅដូចជាវាធំជាង Medford បន្តិច។
 13 ម៉ាយល៍។
 ប៉ុន្តែអ្វីដែលខ្ញុំចង់និយាយគឺបទពិសោធន៍របស់ខ្ញុំក្នុងការជិះឡានក្រុងឬមិនទៅសាលារៀន
 លោកអ៊ុំប្រសិនបើអ្នកក្រឡេកមើលអវត្តមានរបស់ខ្ញុំពីលោកអ៊ុំអ្នកដឹងទេ Massachusetts ស្មោះត្រង់ខ្ញុំប្រហែលជាមាន DCF នៅផ្ទះ។
 អ៊ុំដូច្នេះខ្ញុំគ្រាន់តែសង្ឃឹមថានៅពេលដែលយើងមានគម្រោង, អ៊ុំ, យើងកំពុងនិយាយប្រហែលពីរពាន់ធៀបនឹងមួយពាន់, អ៊ុំ, ខ្ញុំគិតថាវាមានកម្រិតទាបជាងនេះបន្តិច។
 អញ្ចឹងខ្ញុំចង់ជួបក្មេងៗក្នុងកាំពីរម៉ៃល៍។
 ពួកគេយឺតឬអវត្តមានញឹកញាប់ជាងកុមារនៅខាងក្រៅកាំពីរម៉ៃល៍។
 ខ្ញុំពិតជាមិនគិតថាអ្នកអាចមានលទ្ធភាពឆ្លងកាត់មួយម៉ោងនិងឆ្នាំអវត្តមានហើយគិតពីចម្ងាយទៅសាលារៀនហើយប្រសិនបើពួកគេជិះឡានក្រុងឬអ្វីមួយដូចនោះដែលហាក់ដូចជាការងារច្រើន។
 ប៉ុន្តែនេះគឺជាការសម្រេចចិត្តនយោបាយដែលយើងបានធ្វើដោយមិនគិតពីផលប៉ះពាល់របស់វា។
 លទ្ធផលអប់រំ, ដោយសារតែ, អ្នកដឹង, ប្រសិនបើយើងតែងតែត្រលប់មករករឿងនេះជានិច្ច, ប្រសិនបើអ្នកមិននៅក្នុងសាលារៀនអ្នកពិតជាមិនរៀន។
 ដូច្នេះអ្នកដឹងទេបទពិសោធន៍របស់ខ្ញុំក្នុងការទៅចំណតឡានក្រុងឬមិនទៅសាលារៀនទេនេះពិតជាបានកើតឡើងនៅ Medford ផងដែរ។
 ដូច្នេះនៅពេលដែលយើងនិយាយអំពីមួយពាន់ធៀបនឹងពីរពាន់ធៀបនឹងខ្ញុំខ្ញុំគិតថាយើងក៏ត្រូវដឹងថាវាមិនត្រឹមតែផលប៉ះពាល់ហិរញ្ញវត្ថុប៉ុណ្ណោះទេ។
 ប៉ះពាល់ដល់កំណត់ត្រាទាំងអស់។
 អ្នកត្រួតពិនិត្យពិតជាចូលចិត្តពិន្ទុ MCAS របស់គាត់អ្នកដឹងថាពួកគេគឺជាវិធានការណ៍មួយដែលថាតើគាត់ចូលចិត្ត MCAS ឬអត់ពួកគេគឺជាវិធានការមួយហើយវាសំខាន់ណាស់។
 ប៉ុន្តែនេះគឺជាគោលនយោបាយជាក់លាក់មួយដែលជះឥទ្ធិពលដល់ការវាស់។
 ទេខ្ញុំមានន័យថាអត់ទេខ្ញុំមិនបានស្នើសុំរបាយការណ៍ទេប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំដឹងពីបទពិសោធន៍នេះពិតជាត្រឹមត្រូវមែន។
 ប្រសិនបើអ្នកនឹកឡានក្រុងអ្នកនឹងមិនអាចទៅសាលារៀនបានទេ។
 ជាការពិតប្រសិនបើខ្ញុំនឹកឡានក្រុងហើយមិនមានការដឹកជញ្ជូនខ្ញុំមិនអាចដើរទៅសាលារៀនបានទេ
 ខ្ញុំប្រាកដថាកុមារជាច្រើននឹងតូចចិត្តប្រសិនបើពួកគេខកខានឡានក្រុង។
 ប៉ុន្តែមិនមានឡានក្រុងសម្រាប់កុមារទាំងអស់នៅក្នុងកាំពីរម៉ាយលនោះទេ។
 ដូច្នេះនៅពេលដែលយើងមានភ្លៀងធ្លាក់ខ្លាំងមានភ្លៀងធ្លាក់ដ៏គួរឱ្យភ័យខ្លាចដែលយើងធ្លាប់ទទួលបានមុនពេលឡើងកំដៅផែនដីរុញសីតុណ្ហភាពចូលដល់ទសវត្សទី 70, ប្រសិនបើអ្នកជិះឡានក្រុង,
 វាមិនដូចជាអ្នកមិនយកឡានក្រុងហើយត្រូវដើរយ៉ាងហោចណាស់ 40 នាទីដើម្បីទៅសាលារៀន។
 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំមិនមានបញ្ហាទេ។</p>

 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំគិតថាពួកគេធ្វើយើងត្រូវមើលដងថ្លឹងនីមួយៗ។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាពីអ្វីដែលខ្ញុំយល់ប្រសិនបើយើងបានដឹងមុនថ្ងៃទី 1 ខែសីហា
 យើងនឹងជូនដំណឹងដល់គណៈកម្មាធិការថានេះមិនមែនជាអ្វីដែលយើងអាចធ្វើបានផ្នែកហិរញ្ញវត្ថុឬខាងដឹកនាំទេ។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាខ្ញុំបានជូនដំណឹងដល់គណៈកម្មាធិការជំនួសឱ្យការគ្រាន់តែបោះដៃរបស់ខ្ញុំហើយនិយាយថាសុំទោសយើងមិនអាចធ្វើបានទេ។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាអ្វីដែលយើងអាចនិយាយបានគឺអ្នកដឹងទេមុនយើង
 ទាំងនេះគឺជាឧបសគ្គទាំងអស់ក្នុងការដោះលែងនិស្សិតឱ្យទិញសំបុត្រក្នុងចំនួនដ៏ច្រើន។

 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំគិតថាមានបញ្ហាប្រឈមមួយចំនួនប៉ុន្តែដូចខ្ញុំបាននិយាយថាទិសដៅគឺច្បាស់ហើយយើងត្រូវផ្លាស់ទៅក្នុងទិសដៅនោះហើយយើងនឹងធ្វើអ្វីដែលវាត្រូវការដើម្បីធ្វើឱ្យវាកើតឡើង។</p>
