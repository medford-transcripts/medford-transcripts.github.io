    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=208.272s">[David Murphy]</a>:  Thank you, Superintendent, Mayor, members of the school committee.
 It's a pleasure to be with you again this evening.
 for our fifth committee of the whole meeting focused on the FY22 budget.
 As the superintendent mentioned, tonight we'll be focused on elements of the central office, specifically the offices that are under both the superintendent and my own supervision.
 As we go through the beginning of the program, as we have each time, we'll be looking at the org chart and talking specifically about the offices whose budgets are
 are here in light of the fact that these are the offices that myself and the superintendent work most closely with.
 While Dr. Kuching, Ms.
 Galussi, Ms.
 Bowen are here, with the exception of Director McLaughlin, we will be really the only presenters and speakers tonight.
 But certainly we'll be eager to answer any questions that you have, both with respect to the offices that we are focusing on tonight and anything else that we've covered
 over the course of the last several weeks.
 And as I mentioned in my message to the committee, both last night and a few minutes ago, we will be having a budget update on the school committee agenda this coming Monday, May 24th.
 And we'll certainly be picking up questions and comments at that point, incorporating and taking in your feedback.
 And that will go into the development of the recommendations that come before you.
 prior to your June 1st statutory hearing.
 So with that, I will start, as we always do, with the timeline for our budget process, beginning with the development of the district's strategic goals and priorities, leading to a series of, some administrators might say, seemingly endless administrative meetings internally, in which we vet various proposals and comments, questions, and suggestions
 principles and evening, but have not been following along for each of the various budget presentations, both at regular school committee meetings, budget subcommittee and the committee of the whole meetings.
 This is where we are right now leading up to that June 1st public hearing in which members of the community will be invited to speak either for or against, or a favorite for those who follow municipal presentations, those wishing to speak neither for nor against.
 the budget in part or in whole.
 And again, that will take place on June 1st, but there will be a budget update on Monday, an opportunity to comment and engage in further discussion.
 We've used the org chart in each of these presentations, just as by way of showing folks, perhaps outside of the Medford Public Schools community,
 which area of the organization we're focused on in this particular meeting.
 So this is the overall org chart showing all the various offices and departments reporting up to the superintendent.
 And then these are the areas that we'll be discussing tonight.
 So you can see it's primarily the areas in my own portfolio, as well as those reporting directly to the superintendent.
 And you see the curvy arrow there on the right of the screen.
 which is indicating a reorganization of sorts that we'll be proposing as part of the FY22 budget, and that's something I'll be going into greater detail about shortly.
 So as we've discussed in each of the budget presentations, the funding for the Metro Public Schools and the funding generally for school districts across Massachusetts comes from various sources.
 What we often refer to as the Chapter 70 allocation, which is the
 The state contribution under state law coming out of ed reform law of 1993 and the funding that each school community and district are entitled to.
 The local contribution, which is the revenue generated from at the local level that is air marked for the for the school department, which in Medford is a very sizable portion of that of the overall
 operating budget.
 And then the sort of extenuating circumstances under which we're currently operating mean we have a significant influx of federal funding coming in as a result of the COVID-related legislation that has come in.
 And that is coupled with the sort of standing external funds that come in on a year-in and year-out basis, particularly in the area of special education, which we discussed at length at the May 6th Committee of the Whole when we heard from the Office of Pupil Services.
 We've said that throughout the FY22 budget, we've asked those contributing to the development of this budget, meaning our department heads and our principals, to focus essentially on three primary buckets of areas in which we're asking them what are their budgetary priorities, what are their needs, what are their challenges.
 First is personnel and staffing.
 And the committee certainly said before that when we're talking about school budgets, we're almost always talking about people.
 We're an organization made up of people, educating people, hoping to make them better people and people who are positioned to do well in their post-secondary lives.
 But that is always going to be the largest chunk of our budget because, you know, as we say sometimes in school finance, we're not focused on widgets.
 We're focused on people in a community, and that's always going to be the largest chunk.
 Materials and infrastructure, particularly under the challenging conditions under which we're operating, are always going to represent
 another, albeit smaller, aspect of the budget.
 And training and professional development, which everything is, we are looking at everything through a post-COVID context, but for training and professional development, when we think about the ways in which some of the inequities, both within public education and society at large, have come into sharper relief as a result of the experience that we've all lived through, we are thinking very much in that context when we talk about
 what are our professional development and training priorities, and what is it that we're looking to invest in.
 And particularly when we're talking about the superintendent's priorities, while much of what we're planning will be supported by external funding, given that the budget development process is the opportunity to really look at the organization as a whole, see how we're structured, how we're organized, what it is that we're pursuing, what are our discrete challenges, what are our long-term overarching challenges,
 This really is an opportunity to sort of pull the veil back on all of the Medford Public Schools.
 And my hope would be that throughout these committee of the whole presentations, as we've heard from the various directors and school leaders, my hope would be that both for the school committee and the members of the community who are either watching this in real time or perhaps watching it subsequent to the presentations, you'll see the effort toward transparency that we have employed to try to demonstrate for the community exactly what it is that we're doing.
 And I hope also
 the rationale behind these priorities.
 And this slide talks a little bit about that rationale in that these are the questions that were posed that led to the development of these priorities and that we're thinking about what are the targeted and intensive interventions that we can invest in to help reduce or eliminate the learning or opportunity gaps that have either been caused by or exacerbated by the disruption to instruction that our students have faced as a result of
 the COVID-19 pandemic.
 And so there will come a time when our budgetary priorities and our goals are not informed fully by this experience and the disruption that our students have lived through.
 At least I certainly hope that's the case.
 One of the sort of constant refrains that we go back to is we're looking to make investments that will ensure our students' academic careers are not defined by this experience.
 And hopefully if we make these investments and we execute on them wisely, that will be the case.
 But for right now,
 coming out of these, as cliche as it might sound, these unprecedented circumstances, we are looking to see how do we use the funding that's available to us from the local, state, and federal levels to try to put them in the best position possible despite the chaos that we've all lived through.
 So on April 26th, we presented to the school committee the projections that we were looking at based on the preliminary information that we had.
 uh, leading into these budget presentations.
 And we've estimated that, uh, the necessary increase in the budget would be somewhere between 3.4 and $5.8 million.
 Recognizing that there are a significant number of variables that are, uh, essentially not clear while variable one, there are restrictions on federal funding flowing in that are still not particularly clear.
 And I appreciate the mayor's comments to that effect.
 last night, but we're continuing to engage in a very constructive dialogue with our partners in the city government and reaching out to our partners at the state level and elsewhere to try to get clarity on that.
 I think at this point we feel comfortable that the priorities we've developed that we think of as having a strong nexus to the disruption caused by COVID will be essentially eligible expenses.
 It's a question of, from an administrative perspective, exactly how
 we'll go about processing those and exactly how realistic is it to do that.
 So I think we feel good about the priorities that we've identified as our COVID-related or potential ESSER-related priorities, but there's still a lot of clarity that needs to come into view in the coming weeks.
 In addition to that, we know we have fixed costs as every district does on a year-on-year basis.
 These are costs that are related to contractual obligations or
 other situations that have essentially predated the development of this budget, but we know that they're going to lead to an increase in costs.
 Other variables also include the fact that we have upwards of nine collective bargaining agreements that are expiring either at the conclusion of this school year or the conclusion of the summer.
 And so that's certainly a factor that we have to take into account as we work through the development of this budget.
 This is just information related to those external funding, the numbers the committee has seen several times before, so I won't
 belabor it, but we estimate about a $7.6 million ESSER budget over the next several years.
 And so I wouldn't say that we necessarily see that as needing to be expended in equal installments over the three or four year period that we have.
 But I would say that we want to be mindful of the fact that we're going to have additional data that will hopefully point us to more strategic uses of the funding as time goes on.
 So it may be the case that some of the more immediate expenses are in the short term, but the better use of the funding could be in year two or year three.
 And for that reason, we are looking to be, I'm not sure I would use the word conservative, but certainly cautious and cognizant of the implications of using that funding.
 And the fact is, as you've heard me say several times, these are one-time funds and the ESSER funding will not last forever.
 And so we have to be mindful of the uses
 being taking care to not create unnecessary structural deficits, and at the same time, making sure that we're being responsive to the urgent needs of students.
 And so where we strike that equilibrium is a big part of the conversations that we have been having and that we will be having.
 So I'm going to pause for one second before we move on to buildings and grounds and just talk a little bit about what you'll see over the next couple of slides in this, but I'm glad that I flashed to it quickly so that I can tell
 Mr. McLaughlin that he's on next as I continue to babble for another minute or so.
 But the departments that you're seeing starting with buildings, we're going to start with buildings and grounds and then move to the more umbrella offices of the superintendent's office and the office of finance and operations.
 And if you think back to the organizational chart that we saw at the beginning of the presentation, you can see that for both myself and Dr. Edouard-Vincent, there are a lot of priorities and funding and strategic investments
 and proposals that cut across the different departments and offices that you've already heard from.
 And that's a good thing because what we don't want to do is present a budget to you in the form of 25 siloed or overly departmentalized mini organizations.
 We want common themes and common strategic priorities that cut across.
 And so what you'll see in the bullets that we've identified are pieces that are either reflective of those priorities
 or operational pieces that are meant to put us in a position that we'll be able to actually pursue those priorities and do so successfully.
 Similar to the information technology budget proposals that we discussed in last night's committee of the whole, a large portion, arguably all, frankly, of the buildings and grounds priorities, the year maintenance issue,
 uh, that is essentially routine.
 I think routine was the word that we used in the technology presentation.
 That's something that we typically are going to incorporate one way or another into our operating budget.
 Um, something that is a one-time expense and I'm using the term one time in the context of municipal budgeting.
 And so one time could mean every 10 years, every 15 years, every 20 years, but certainly not on an annual basis.
 Um, that's every 20 years, but certainly not on an annual basis.
 That's something that we're going to look up to as a capital expense that we're going to try to keep off the operating budget for purposes of not creating some of those deficits that we've talked about.
 What we do when we have a large influx of federal funding, frankly, similar to how we handled the funding that came in during FY21, and to some extent in FY20 as well, is to try to address some of the most urgent priorities and needs that might in another context be considered a capital expense.
 but in light of the urgency, we're looking to just take what funding is available and make sure that that's addressed.
 That was certainly the case as is reflected in the buildings and grounds budget narrative that was provided to you today with regard to our HVAC repairs that we needed to expedite and accelerate at the beginning of this school year for purposes of getting students and staff back into the physical school buildings.
 And so I expressed my appreciation for Mr. McLaughlin and members of his team who partnered with
 the external experts that we brought in to make that a reality.
 The history as to how we got to the place where so much work was necessary, I think, has been addressed at length in previous meetings.
 But however we got here, we are in a much better position from an air quality perspective because that work was done throughout the course of this year.
 And now we're looking at some of the other heavy infrastructure pieces that may not land in the operating budget for FY22.
 but are critical priorities that need to be addressed in the near term.
 And I'm going to ask Mr. McLaughlin, if he could, to walk us through some of these.
 As we're talking about how these investments need to be made in the coming year or months.
 So John, do you want to take it from there and just start maybe with the generator and transformer electrical issues that we have
 been identified at the high school and at the Andrews and then we'll walk through some of the other pieces.
 From there we'll move on to finance operations in the superintendent's office and then we'll go to questions after that.

 几年前我会有多氯联苯。
 所以我们必须去掉 PCB 并在上面涂上另一种油。
 最终发生的情况是橡胶密封件容易脱落。
 所以我正在获取报价。
 我有，今天刚收到，检查变压器。
 并确保我们能够回到我们需要去的地方。
 它的油量很低，但仍在运行，但它肯定是应该优先考虑的事情，因为它还运行着大约三分之一的功率。
 在梅德福高中。
 然后我们将准备好定价信息以继续推进。
 显然，这将是一个带有发电机的夏季项目，只要我们准备好承担该项目即可。
 今年我们进行了一些安全改进。
 我们有一个新的 Raptor 系统。
 当时我安装了所有显示器，并接受了新 Raptor 系统的培训。
 如果你不知道猛禽系统是你进来的地方，你给自己一个许可证，他们会扫描它。
 如果一切顺利，您将收到一个标签，并准备好前往总办公室办理您在我们任何学校需要办理的业务。
 因此，我们希望每三四年完成一次停车场。
 我应该说，通常是整个系统范围内的所有这些。
 停车场又被标记了，它们开始老化了。
 我们想做一些
 梅福德高中的调整，我们将就残疾人停车情况与该学校会面。
 我知道我们在谈论主入口时进行了这样的对话。
 我认为我们想要做的是搬到梅福德高中前面的残疾人专用点，并进入那里的残疾人坡道。
 所以，你知道，让我们回顾一下。
 我和
 Lungo-Koehn 市长上周表示，如果我需要帮助，我们在市政厅有交通部门，他们会非常乐意帮助我们。
 几年前，我们与他们会面，试图做出一些改进，但众所周知，过去的一年并不是我们通常处理的典型年份。
 柯蒂斯塔夫茨锅炉项目，所以去年冬天，锅炉开始泄漏。
 这些都是我们可能会在下周的小组委员会会议上讨论的问题。
 这就是为什么我们订购了一些需要重新安装的部件，即分段部件。
 因此，我们得到了两个部分，他们将更换它们，这应该可以阻止我们预期的泄漏。
 我们将不得不在这方面花费大量资金。
 和暖通空调的改进。
 所以我们知道我们做了很多这样的事情。
 我们目前正在打开空调。
 因此，存在与此相关的问题，某些特定区域需要我们聘请承包商来修复。
 根据法律规定，我们必须在 5 月 15 日之前提供供暖。
 所以这周是我们进行结算的一周。
 不幸的是，本周很热，你知道，这很愚蠢，但这周很热。
 教室里的一些老师感到有点不舒服，但我们正在努力解决。
 我们知道你在那里。
 我们将尽快出去处理所有需要做的事情。
 致电承包商。
 我只是想列出一份我们需要做的事情以及需要做的建筑物的清单。
 嗯，浴室改造项目。
 戴夫和我会见了建筑师。
 嗯，我想我们只是在等待获得许可来查看并制作该项目的 RFP。
 是，我知道这是一个，嗯，
 梅福德高中项目对于改善浴室的许多人来说都是很亲近的。
 我们想要它，我知道。
 市长让我们看看我们能生产多少。
 我想如果我们能得到一个价格，我们就会知道我们在哪里，然后我们就可以从那里走得尽可能远。
 我们仍在等待主入口修复工程。
 看看我们要做什么。
 我们的一个在清洁办公室工作的人是一名瓦工，所以他主动提出出去尝试修复一点墙壁，花岗岩墙。
 所以今天他在那里工作。
 我的意思是，我希望我能让它看起来更好一点，但它仍然会
 什么，是什么，所以你知道我们当然可以在主入口见面，我想我们将在下周和小组委员会讨论并讨论我们希望如何推进这一点。
 这就是为什么我每年都会在预算范围内订购一辆带犁的卡车。
 所以这并没有改变。
 这肯定会对降雪有所帮助，也肯定会对整个地区的其他杂项项目有所帮助。
 如果我们有一辆带犁的卡车。
 所以，你知道，我可以多次帮助 DPW，因为他们行动非常迅速。
 而且，你知道，有时有些区域需要修补，但他们无法返回，因为主要目标是城市周围的道路。
 因此，拥有这样的东西肯定会有助于提高效率。
 由我们处置，接机。
 现在，我想，现在的剧院正在翻修，如果你看到我的预算前报告的话。
 如果我有一个希望看到成果的项目，那就是添加空调、栏杆、更新门以及在剧院进行一些电气工作。
 几年前我得到了一个价格，现在的价格不同了：在剧院的天花板上加装一台空调需要 10 万美元。
 我认为这对社区也有好处。
 也为学校创造收入，也许在某个时候将其添加到我们的资本改进清单中。
 但是，就像我说的，如果我可以选择我想做的高中项目，那将是我的主要项目之一，即改造项目。
 我们一直致力于学校的暖通空调改进项目。
 你知道，在某些时候，也许我们可以从 MSBA 获得帮助，也许我们可以添加空调以及梅福德高中目前没有空调的其他部分，这意味着科学实验室是建筑物中唯一有空调的真正部分。
 服务，你知道，除了我们到处都有的窗式空调。
 所以看不到底部。</p>

 이사회라는 영역 중 하나는 무엇보다도 사회적 학습 행동을 기반으로 경영을 중단하는 방법입니다.
 그래서 그것이 정말로 최우선 과제입니다.
 우리에게 이것은 전문성 개발의 목표 영역 중 하나입니다.
 또한, 우리는 실제 편견과 그것이 학교 공동체에 미치는 영향에 관해 더 큰 이해와 전문성 개발을 계속해서 모색할 것입니다.
 우리는 또한 리더, 멘토, 교사로서 모범 사례 기술을 지속적으로 개발할 것입니다.
 모든 학교에서 책임성을 장려하는 교사 평가 시스템에 대해 설명합니다.
 이것은 세 개의 큰 블록입니다.
 우리는 실제 편견을 다루는 동시에 반인종차별적 문화적 역량도 다룹니다.
 따라서 모든 학생과 더 넓은 지역 사회의 요구를 충족하기 위해 학구를 전환함에 따라 이러한 모든 계획이 중요합니다.
 우리는 또한 계속해서 장애 인식에 초점을 맞추고 편견을 없애기 위해 다시 한 번 노력할 것입니다.
 거기.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=2280.431s">[David Murphy]</a>: 谢谢你，博士。
 然后去财务和运营办公室。
 正如您所看到的，这里有一些不同点。
 我将重点关注三个方面，包括交通，我认为它有自己的幻灯片，而且确实如此，谢谢。
 但首先，前两个，这是在昨晚的演讲中提到的。
 我认为这是在英语学习部门确定的优先事项的背景下发生的。
 想要投资一个机会来发展我们的努力，主要是我们的家庭承诺和社区关系。
 我当时指出，我们没有确定 22 财年对 EL 部门的具体投资的部分原因是我们从该地区获得了一项投资，我们希望能够推动这一事业，我们将为此努力。
 与 EL 部门、卫生服务部门、特殊教育部门等密切合作。
 我认为，当我们考虑如何构建组织以及如何组织特定的工作组合时，作为一般规则，最佳实践是确定需求，确定正在满足的需求或由于其他变化变量而正在发展的需求，
 然后确定如何最好地开发适合组织结构的角色和组合，以促进这些目标。
 然而，有时会出现多种事件同时发生的情况，我们的领导人员具有可用的能力和不断出现且变得更加紧迫的需求。
 这种融合发生在整个学年。
 老实说，引起我们注意的方式之一是当我们需要将整个行政部门转移到学校担任代课教师时。
 当我们清楚地意识到这令人筋疲力尽且几乎不可能时，我们试图做出不同的修改，我们的课前和课后规划主任继续自愿承担这项工作，并继续与我们沟通，就像她一段时间以来所做的那样，她觉得
 他的投资组合中有空间容纳额外的责任和信心类型，以及我们作为经理和领导者所拥有的个人能力。
 事实上，我们能够度过本学年，但通过能够确定我们可以在父母和家庭参与领域改进和更好地工作的做法，
 我指望黛安·考德威尔（Diane Caldwell）的帮助，她是我们的前副总监，曾担任家长信息中心的高级主任。
 我要说的是，作为一个新来这个学区的人，我在第一周继承了家长信息中心作为我的投资组合的一部分，没有夫人。
 考德威尔，
 如果能够提供这种领导力、指导和机构知识，这将是更具挑战性的一年，不仅是在对 PIC 的监督方面，而且在我和其他高级管理人员负责的工作的几乎所有其他要素方面。
 但我们从一开始就知道，
 考德威尔担任家长信息中心的管理员并不是一个永久的解决方案，他试图在内部运作
 在我们的预算范围内，我们不一定打算为家长信息中心主任作为一个没有其他职责的单一职位提供资金。
 然后是夫人。
 Fidler 表达了承担额外责任的意愿和热情。
 我们认为家长信息中心与贫困学校和缺勤学校计划之间有着紧密的自然联系，以及额外的支持
 呃，我们需要的能力，嗯，我们需要在家庭关系、交通方面的能力。
 嗯，我们认为这适合作为一个合法的、全面的管理组合。
 因此，作为 22 财年预算的一部分，我们建议将这些办公室重组为一般家庭参与区域，其中包括对家长信息中心的监督、对课前和课后计划的持续监督。
 以及交通连接等服务。
 现在，坦率地说，所有这些角色组合在一起的原因之一是它们是学年的不同部分，需要更大程度的关注和细节。
 这就是为什么我说这是一种融合，因为它非常适合与已经具备机构知识的人一起创建一个完整的 12 个月的角色。
 并在过去为该地区做出了出色的工作。
 这就是为什么能够有效地做到这一点，同时也对如何更有效地推进学区围绕家庭和社区伙伴关系的目标充满信心，是制定该提案的一部分。
 所以这是一场戏。
 然后你会看到，正如昨晚也提到的，
 我们设立了赠款协调员职位。
 这本身是一个非预算的事情，它不一定会对运营预算和赠款产生影响，这个人基本上一直担任非官方赠款协调员一段时间，但从技术上讲，在行政助理的角色中，我们已经能够将该人调到财务和运营办公室，与米歇尔·金登和她的团队合作，以确保我们
 履行我们的所有义务并尽可能有效地从合规角度执行。
 这是不同的，我想强调这一点。
 这当然与我们目前没有的拨款写作角色不同，但我们正在探索其他方法来释放一些能力，让管理员有机会更好地培养外部合作伙伴关系和
 并寻找赠款机会，以便我们的赠款协调员能够帮助协调并尝试以这种方式释放额外的预算能力。
 在我们谈论交通之前，我想再说一遍，这是我们昨晚谈话的延续。
 在本学年中，我们继续与 Management Solution 和 Paquette 先生保持合作关系，Paquette 先生担任临时代理
 夫人之间的业务管理员
 帕特森和我。
 我们已准备好委托提交给学校委员会的报告。
 基本上，我要求对报告进行附录，因为该报告是在整个学年中准备的，并在某种程度上促进了预算制定过程。
 我问帕克特先生，根据我们仍然拥有的预付款，
 基本上，您可以填写一些补充内容，其中会考虑到我们所做的一些更改，夫人。
 Kimu 和我在过去的几个月里将这一点付诸实践。
 这就是为什么我预计在本财年结束之前将其提交给委员会。
 然后，帕克特先生，我们与塔夫茨大学的合作伙伴关系，一开始只是测试合作伙伴关系，后来发展为对话。
 在技​​术基础设施的背景下，我希望我们整个夏天都能非常有效地从中受益。
 但随后我们还将探讨在展望 2022 财年时我们应该保留或可能参考的其他外部知识。
 这是一个高层次的概述。
 我将结束交通，然后继续回答您的问题。
 如果您还记得当我们谈论 22 财年的预测时，我们的成本增加了约 51,000。
 我必须快速地说，这些是因为它们是在 5 月 6 日解决的。
 这些与我们与特殊教育相关的固定交通成本无关。
 这是我们的主要供应商东方巴士。
 学校委员会于 2020 年春季签订了一份为期三年的新合同。
 所以，我们正在完成其中的第一个。
 的三年合同。
 与合同一样，成本逐年增加。
 因此，我们预计该合同将增加约 51,000 美元，作为我们预计固定成本增加 210 万美元的一部分。
 4 月 26 日，当提出有关 MBTA 通行证的请求时，您已经看到了以下两个数字。
 这本质上是我们的一个选择
 确保委员会知道。
 然后还有一些问题，涉及额外黄色巴士的基本成本以及在高中提供额外东区巴士容量的可能性。
 我们估计约为 75,000 美元。
 我之所以说它是零到 75,000 美元，是因为在我们与供应商的对话中，他们有，
 我认为，并且我很欣赏这一点，我不知道是否所有提供商都会这样做，但他们建议，根据本学年之前该学区采用的半径，就初中和高中交通而言，有可能重新调整我们现有的一些能力，以提供至少一辆额外的巴士到高中。
 下周我们将与
 巴士提供商以及梅德福警察局，我们将在那里讨论一系列问题，既与安全有关，也与规划即将到来的夏季学年的路线和站点的开发有关。
 所以，坦率地说，我目前没有向委员会提出关于是否应该增加第二辆公共汽车的任何建议。
 我认为很明显我们可以做到这一点。
 所以我认为问题在于查看有关哪里的数据
 什么是高中生以及是否有需求。
 我要说的是，在我与中等教育管理部门的简短对话中，我们根本不清楚是否知道对此有明确的需求，但我认为我们要牢记这一点。
 但与此同时，如果为学生提供更方便的服务的成本在 0 到 75,000 美元之间，那么显然我们会考虑这一点。
 我认为从战略角度来看，我们需要牢记 MBTA 通行证显然有可能提供更多的准入机会。
 而且，你知道，你开始考虑学生工作、去城市的机会。
 城市还有其他类型的体验，例如 MBTA 通行证可以为学生提供的课堂和体验式学习体验。
 我们正在考虑所有这些选择。
 贯穿所有演示的一个共同点是，我们决心在 21-22 学年为学生建立有效的延长上课日和课外活动计划，利用 ESSER 资金确保我们在学生面临重大干扰后提供尽可能最大的恢复支持。
 因此，我感谢您抽出时间并在这方面给予我宽容。
 如果你喜欢我可以提供更多证词和证人的演示，我保证我也更喜欢它们。
 但这些是建筑物和土地、财务和运营办公室以及主管办公室的记录。
 此时，我将很乐意回答您的问题。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3062.978s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 감사합니다.
 가까운 회원을 위한 밴과 루소 회원을 위한 밴이 있습니다.</p>

 결국 나는 스쿨버스를 옮기러 갈 것이다.
 Dave, 당신은 우리에게 몇 가지 흥미로운 옵션을 제공했지만 가격에는 큰 차이가 있습니다.
 이 시점에서 이 예산을 생성하면
 당신은 누구이며 우리를 소개할 것인가?
 자, 어떻게 시작할까요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3100.169s">[David Murphy]</a>: 글쎄요, 첫 번째 예비 결정은 위원회가 유치원을 제외한 모든 학년에 대해 1마일 반경보다 작년에 채택한 반경을 선호하는지 여부였습니다.
 그렇다면 위원회가 이를 유지하기를 원하는 경우
 판매자가 초등학교에 많이 있을 거라고 확실히 말하고 있다는 뜻입니다.
 따라서 약 140만 달러에 달하는 현재 버스 계약으로 인해 추가 스쿨버스가 제공될 것이며, 고등학교에서 수용 인원을 늘리기 위해 이 버스를 사용하는 것을 고려해야 한다고 생각합니다.
 내 유일한 질문
 그렇지 않으면 우리는 $100,000의 추가 비용을 발생시키지 않고 방과 후 프로그램으로 전환하여 수업 시간을 연장할 수 있습니다.
 아니면 적어도 비용을 지불할 가치가 있습니다.
 그래서 첫 번째 결정은 협의회가 마일리지 반경에 만족하는지 여부라고 생각하는데, 서비스 제공업체에서는 이것이 큰 문제가 아니라고 말합니다.
 이것이 우리가 있는 곳입니다.
 그렇다면
 그래서 다음 단계는 고등학생들이 어디에 살고 있는지, 학생들의 위치를 알 수 있는 유용한 방법이 있는지에 대한 데이터를 살펴보는 것이라고 생각합니다.
 다시 말하지만, 이 프로그램의 유일한 단점은 MBTA 승인을 받으면 학교까지 데려다 주지 않는다는 것입니다.
 특히 고등학생들에게는 MBTA Transit이 제공할 수 있는 체험 기회가 많다고 생각합니다.
 마지막으로 말하고 싶은 것은 소프트웨어를 구매와 연관시키면 MBTA 토큰이 더 나은 투자가 된다는 것입니다.
 저는 이것이 다소 시간이 걸릴 수 있다고 생각하며, 여름은 멘토들이 이러한 투자의 잠재적 영향에 영향을 줄 수 있는 이러한 유형의 기회를 개발하기에 충분한 시간일 수 있다고 생각합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3230.138s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: 자, Dave, 마일리지에 대해 말씀하신 내용으로 돌아가 보겠습니다.
 나는 선거를 놓치지 않았다고 말해야합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3239.024s">[David Murphy]</a>: 그러니까...시간이 너무 앞서긴 했지만, 신중하게 고려된 이 계획이 다기능 계획인 학교 위원회에 제출될 때 라디오 방송도 그 일부라는 것을 이해합니다.
 그 결과 노선과 정류장이 개선되었습니다.
 나는 그렇게 생각했고, 나는 그것을 알고 있다는 것을 알았다.
 왜냐하면 올해 승객 수가 많이 감소했기 때문입니다. 일반적으로 버스 정류장에서 나와 기본적인 답변을 듣게 되지만 올해는 그런 일이 발생하지 않았습니다.
 전염병 확산으로 인해 승객 수가 크게 감소했을 가능성도 있습니다.
 만약 내년에 그런 일이 일어나지 않는다면, 그것에 대해 생각해 보고 싶을 수도 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3280.253s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: 네, 승객 수가 크게 줄어든 것은 충분히 이해할 수 있다고 생각합니다.
 메드포드에는 자신이 사는 곳의 교통과 도로 안전에 대한 우려 때문에 버스를 타는 학생들이 있다는 것을 알고 있습니다.
 그래서 이 자동화는 자동화는 1마일이고 자동화는 결코 1마일이 아니라고 말합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3307.655s">[David Murphy]</a>: 가장 중요한 것은 이에 대해 사과한다는 것입니다.
 당연하다고 생각한다면 번개는 안전과 아무런 관련이 없습니다.
 귀하의 버스 정류장은 다음 주에 우리 대화의 일부가 될 것입니다.
 따라서 여기에는 지역 대표자와 상인뿐만 아니라 지방 경찰도 있습니다.
 도로와 위치를 연구하고 분석할 때 우려되는 부분이 공공 안전 전문가와 전문가에 의해 철저히 검사되었는지 확인하고 싶기 때문입니다.
 보안 규칙에 대한 예외가 모든 스트리밍 정책보다 우선한다는 것은 의심의 여지가 없습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3344.167s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: 글쎄요, 이 중 일부는 비밀이거나 오랫동안 존재해 왔으며 이를 제거하려는 움직임은 짜증스러울 수밖에 없습니다.
 우리가 공간을 확보하고 현재 버스를 사용할 수 있을 것이라고 말씀하시면 매우 낙관적으로 들립니다.
 Dave는 나에게 낙관적인 것처럼 보이고 나도 일반적으로 낙관적이지만 둘 사이를 거래할 준비가 되어 있지 않습니다.
 예, 350 이상이면 큰 변화입니다.
 많은 사람들이 우리가 예산을 어디에 지출하는지 정확히 이해하는 데 어려움을 겪고 있기 때문에 제가 말씀드릴 수 있는 것이 몇 가지 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3389.268s">[David Murphy]</a>: 예, 이것들은 모두 좋은 점입니다.
 분명히 말하면, 이러한 진술은 위원회의 질문에 대한 답변입니다.
 아니요, 모르겠습니다. 그 35만명의 사람들이 어디서 왔는지 잘 모르겠습니다.
 그러니 진실을 말하세요.
 이것이 사실이다</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3403.415s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: 이것은 정확합니다.
 동시에 정의의 문제이기 때문에 이 문제를 제기한 동료들에게 감사드립니다.
 그래서 우리가 그것에 대해 더 많은 대화를 나누게 될 것이 분명하다고 생각합니다.
 매우 좋은.
 나는 다른 사람들에게 나 자신을 바친다.</p>

 어디인지 궁금합니다. 이미 말씀드렸다면 죄송합니다. 하지만 스포츠나 단체를 위한 교통수단은 없는 것 같습니다.
 이런 일이 다시 일어날까요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3448.128s">[David Murphy]</a>: 문제는 오늘 밤 발표한 데이터가 여기에 포함되어 있느냐는 것입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3453.891s">[David Murphy]</a>: 아니요, 하지만 그것은 그가 스포츠나 예술에 쓰는 돈으로 생활하기 때문입니다.
 이 케이블은 과세 연도 동안 다시 활성화됩니다.
 어느 것도 삭감되지는 않지만 2020년 회계연도에 유지되거나 복원될 예정입니다.
 따라서 우리는 모든 활동, 스포츠 행사 등에 적합한 교통수단을 갖추고 있으니 안심하십시오.
 부서별 요청사항입니다.
 내가 아는 한, FY21에 대한 작년 형식보다 더 많은 것을 요구하는 사람은 없습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3661.661s">[David Murphy]</a>: 아니요, 좋은 질문입니다.
 나는 당신이 옳다고 생각합니다.
 내 말은, 때로는 차이가 있다는 것입니다.
 내 생각엔 더 많은 것 같아
 이러한 지역 간의 차이는 육상을 중심으로 존재하는 글로벌 시스템 때문에 발생합니다.
 그렇기 때문에 그 차이를 자주 볼 수 있다고 생각합니다. 그러나 그들은 학생들을 끌어들이고 정직하게 교육을 즐기고 최대한 활용할 수 있도록 여기로 데려오는 우리 교육 프로그램의 일부와 유사한 역할을 합니다.
 그래서 나는 그것을 조사하고 그것이 존재하는지 확인하게되어 기쁩니다.
 고치는 데 도움이 필요할 수 있는 결함이 있나요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3704.757s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: 감사합니다
 그래서 나는 욕실 프로젝트에서 본 또 다른 질문을 하기로 결정했습니다.
 다시 말하지만, 올해는 학생들에게 월경 제품을 제공할 방법을 찾으려고 노력하는 4년차이자 4년차입니다.
 정말 부끄러운 일입니다.
 이번 회의에 참석한 모든 분들이 이에 동의하실지는 모르겠지만 매우 어렵습니다.
 CCSR 프로젝트는 계절학기 학생들이 이러한 제품에 접근하는 데 어려움을 겪지 않도록 보장하기 위해 4년 연속 실행되었습니다.
 흥미로웠습니다.
 저는 누구에게도 투표하지 않을 것임을 분명히 하고 싶습니다.
 욕실 개조 모든 욕실을 개조한 경우 무료 계절 디스펜서가 없습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3762.382s">[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>: 에드워드 빈센트 박사요?
 루소 씨, 이 글을 쓰신 이후로 고등학교 학생들이 화장실을 사용하고 여성용품 사용이 허용되지 않으면 의료실이 완비되어 있다고 믿으신다는 점을 말씀드리고 싶습니다.
 욕실에서는 여성용 제품이 사용되지만 안타깝게도 여성용 제품이 다른 용도로 사용되는 경우도 있습니다.
 그들은 욕실을 장식하는 데 사용되었으며 결국 천장에 설치되었습니다.
 이런 일이 여러 번 일어났습니다.
 통제되고 감시되는 욕실입니다.
 그래서 CCSR 학생 여러분을 초대해서 이 프로젝트를 진행하게 되었는데, 진료실에서 여성용품을 구입할 수 있고 접근이 차단되지 않는다는 점을 모두가 알아주셨으면 합니다.
 우리는 의료 분야에 많은 제품을 가지고 있고 학생들이 사용할 수 있는 기계를 제공하는 것을 반대하지는 않지만, 우리가 그것을 나눠준다면 그들이 원하는 목적으로 사용하는 것이 아니라는 점을 지적하고 싶습니다.
 이것이 그들이 과거에서 배제된 이유 중 하나이다.
 그래서 저는 단지 우리가 학생들에게 이것이 존재하지 않는다고 말하거나 학생들에게 말하려는 것이 아니라는 점을 말하고 싶습니다.
 저는 이것이 가능하며 특히 1차 및 2차 의료 환경에 충분한 공급이 있다는 것을 모든 사람이 알기를 바랍니다.
 이 서비스는 모든 약속에 이용 가능합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3866.52s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: 감사합니다
 시장님, 빨리 답변해 주시면 좋겠습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3869.988s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 따라서 Kretz 참가자가 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3872.29s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: 네, 이해합니다.
 나는 누구에게도 이런 것들을 부정하라고 조언하지 않을 것입니다.
 나는 단순히 학교 지도를 들고 병원에서 가장 먼 지점에 있는 학생을 상상해 볼 것을 제안합니다.
 내 말은, 모든 연구위원 중에서 여기 있는 사람은 나뿐이라는 거야.
 그는 그런 경험이 없었습니다.
 나는 단지 여러분 모두에 대해 가정을 하고 있을 뿐인데, 이 큰 건물의 의료 센터에서 그렇게 멀리 떨어져 있다는 것은 나조차도 상상할 수 없으며, 여러분은 그것이 어디에 있는지 알고 있다고 말합니다.
 건물이 어떻게 생겼는지 살펴보기 위해 걸어가봤습니다.
 우선 여기는 도보 2분 거리가 아니라고 말씀드렸는데요.
 즉, “언제인지는 모르겠지만 아마도 그럴 것 같아요.”라고 말하는 것입니다.
 우리가 진입 장벽이라고 생각하는 것은 너무 높거나 너무 높은 것처럼 보이지만 실제로는 비슷한 것이 없습니다.
 나는 이것을 한 다른 분야가 있고 나는 그렇지 않다는 것을 알고 있습니다. 따라서 그것은 세계의 첫 페이지에 큰 문제가 아닙니다.
 나는 건강에 관해 읽은 내용이 건전한 청소년 활동이 아니라는 것을 알고 있습니다. 작년에 학교에서 요구하는 법을 잊어버렸습니다.
 하지만 설치하고 무료로 나눠주는 초기 상황이 있습니다. 천장에 붙어 있고 필요한 아이들은 바구니 전체를 집으로 가져갈 수 있습니다.
 하지만 많은 일이 그렇듯 지루할 수도 있습니다.
 그러면 학생들이 필요할 때 그곳에 있을 것입니다.
 그래서 저는 이것이 단순한 프로젝트가 되기를 원하지 않습니다.
 나는 단지 굳게 믿는다.
 CCSR, 제 생각엔 CCSR 프로젝트인 것 같아요. 일주일 전에 제 페이스북 받은 편지함에 올라왔죠. 학생들이 이 일을 하는 것과 관련이 있는 것 같아요.
 그들은 더 이상 할 일이 없기 때문에 그것을 하지 않습니다.
 그래서 우리는 학생들의 말을 듣지 않는 것 같아요.
 저는 CCSR 2016 웹사이트를 올해의 프로젝트 중 하나로 생각합니다.
 언제가 될지는 모르겠지만, 감사합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4012.217s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Crist 의원님, Graham 의원님, McLaughlin 의원님, 감사합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4015.74s">[Kathy Kreatz]</a>: 글쎄요, 저는 그저 감사하다는 말씀을 드리고 싶습니다.
 처음에는 배달에 관해 질문이 있었지만 먼저 이것이 훌륭한 프레젠테이션이었다는 점을 알아주셨으면 합니다. McLaughlin, 당신은 훌륭한 일을 했고 당신에게는 의제가 있었습니다.
 이 문제는 다음주 안건으로 상정될 예정이며, 다음주 소위원회에서 논의하도록 하겠습니다.
 그럼 배송에 관해 또 질문이 있습니다.
 거울에 비친 내용이 기억나지 않아서 이런 정보를 넣었기 때문에 일이 일어난 것입니다.
 그래서 2021년 올림픽 교통 조언을 읽었는데, 모든 공립 학교는 노란색 학교의 학생을 태우거나 내려주지 않을 것이라고 나와 있습니다. 심지어 실제 주소가 학교 전체 2마일 이내에 있어도 마찬가지입니다.
 우리는 이러한 변화가 큰 부담임을 알고 있으며 항상 이 금액 이상의 배송을 제공할 것입니다.
 그래서 제가 정확한 정보를 가지고 있는지 잘 모르겠습니다.
 머피 씨, 말씀하신 상황에 대해서는 저는 아무런 정보도 갖고 있지 않습니다.
 이 주제에 대한 회의는 단 한 번도 기억 나지 않습니다.
 그래서 나는 이것에 대해 이야기하고 싶습니다.
 나는 당신을 알고
 Van der der가 이에 대해 이야기했습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4092.141s">[David Murphy]</a>: 선생님, 저는 단지 명확히 하고 싶습니다.
 나는 이 일이 내가 여기에 오기 전에 일어났던 일을 부인하기 위해 이렇게 말합니다. 그러나 나는 그 이후로 계속 그 일에 관여해 왔습니다.
 제 동료 중 누군가가 자신의 추억을 공유하고 싶다면 그렇게 해주세요.
 그런데 위원회를 만들 때 설명했듯이 반경은 2.0마일이었습니다.
 중학교용인 것으로 알고 있습니다.
 다시 말하지만, 이것에는 한계가 있습니다. 제가 학교에서 1마일 반 정도 가르쳐 준 것 같지만 그것은 저와 관련이 없었습니다.
 또한 전체 버스의 강성을 줄이기 위해 서비스 제공업체는 1차 수준에서 1마일 반경, 2차 수준에서 2마일 반경을 채택하도록 조언해야 합니다.
 이봐, 이거 읽어봐.
 솔직히 말해서, 버스 승객 수가 너무 많이 감소하여 제공업체가 1마일 거리를 시행해야 하는지 여부가 불분명합니다.
 그건 그렇고, 이것은 유치원에는 적용되지 않는다고 말해야합니다.
 따라서 거부는 IEP에서 학군, 유치원, 장애 학생 및 교통의 안전을 거부하는 것이며, 물론 이러한 대화도 포함되지 않습니다.
 하지만 1마일 반경과 2마일 반경은 코로나19 제한 사항에 따라 달라지며 다른 하나도 마찬가지입니다.
 솔직히 말해서, 제한 사항을 강제로 준수하지 않는 것은 사회에서 드문 일이 아니며, 특히 버스에 좌석이 있을 때 더욱 그렇습니다.
 이것이 바로 우리가 이번 여름에 할 일입니다. 경로를 계획하고 이 차를 가지고 공급업체에 들러볼 것입니다.
 이렇게 하면 계약에 따라 버스 18대가 우리에게 공급될 가능성이 크다”고 공급업체는 경고했다.
 작년 승인에 따라 우리는 단 17대의 버스가 필요하며, 이로 인해 두 번째 스쿨버스 서비스를 제공하기 위해 18대의 버스가 확보될 것입니다.
 저는 쿠싱 박사님께서 손을 드는 모습을 봤다는 생각이 들었습니다.
 내가 틀렸다면 정정해 주십시오.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4219.238s">[Peter Cushing]</a>: 당신은 아무 문제가 없다고 말합니다.
 맞아요.
 팬데믹의 긍정적인 측면 중 하나는 실제로 관리자 간의 관계가 강화되었다는 것입니다.
 안전한 통학 경로를 보장하고, 버스 정류장을 통한 화석 연료 배출 제로, 도보 스쿨버스를 통해 학생들에게 안전한 통학 방법을 제공하기 위해 스스로 책임을 지고 있는 시 공무원과 학부모님께 사과드립니다.
 그리고 아이들에게 안전하게 학교에 갈 수 있는 기회를 줄 수 있는 다른 방법도 생각해 봅시다. 하지만 이 역시 작년에 우리가 대화를 나누었을 때 우리 모두가 생각하고 있던 팬데믹으로 인해 발생한 문제이기도 합니다.
 사람들을 만나고 학교로 향합니다.
 우리는 모든 학생 사이트로부터 GIS 매핑 데이터를 받습니다.
 대유행이 둔화됨에 따라 우리는 이 모든 것을 조사하기 위해 종합적인 분석을 수행한 다음, 대유행이 습관과 태도를 바꿀 수 있는 가능성을 고려했습니다.</p>

 감사합니다
 또한 다가오는 학년도에 가능한 건강 정보에 관해 질문이 있습니다.
 에이프릴, 당신이 여기 왔는지는 모르겠지만 패터슨은 알고 있어요.
 우리는 MBTA를 가지고 브라마 데이에 학교로 돌아왔기 때문에 노동절을 앞두고 고등학생들이 MBTA를 이용할 수 없을까 걱정했습니다.
 노동절을 며칠 앞두고 아이들은 학교로 돌아왔습니다.
 버스 정류장에서 기다리고 있는 학생들로부터 문자 메시지를 받았는데 버스가 거기에 없다는 것을 알고 있습니다.
 그들은 산책을 마치고 학교에 늦게 도착했습니다.
 그러니 다음 학년도를 준비하세요.
 노란색 버스가 추가되었으며 처음 며칠 동안 가장 빈번한 정류장 중 일부가 고등학생을 위해 운행될 것입니다.
 자세한 내용은 모두 기억나지 않지만, 이것이 현재 진행 중인 문제라는 점만 알아주셨으면 합니다.
 노동절 전에 시작하기 때문에 매년.
 그런 다음 노동절 이후에는 정규 수업 시간 동안 MBT 버스가 운행됩니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4398.254s">[David Murphy]</a>: 여성
 키츠, 정말 마음에 들어요.
 이것은 내가 전에 해본 일이 아닙니다.
 나는 가능한 한 빨리 혼자 공부할 것이다.
 첫 번째 질문은 노동절 이후 이 버스에 무슨 일이 일어났는가입니다.
 이번 주에 그런 일이 일어났다면 어떻게, 왜 그런 일이 일어났는지 조금 궁금할 테니까요.
 내가 말하고 싶은 건</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4416.775s">[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>: 이것은 버스 회사의 오래된 관행이며 당과 동방에서는 이를 알고 있습니다. 왜냐하면 우리가 인근 여러 지역에 유치원을 열고 그들 중 많은 사람들이 같은 일을 하며 버스를 준비하여 우리가 학교를 통과하고 다른 학교의 학교에 갈 수 있기 때문입니다.
 그러니 이전에 하던 일을 계속할 수 있고, 저희는 반드시 Kreatz 멤버들과 계속해서 협력할 것입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4444.807s">[David Murphy]</a>: 감사합니다
 예, 우리는 계속해서 그렇게 할 것이라고 생각하며, 동부 버스 회의에서도 용량 문제를 제기할 것입니다. 왜냐하면 고등학교로 더 많은 노란색 버스를 이동한다는 소식을 들었을 때 우리가 이를 살펴봐야 하기 때문입니다.
 그럼 또 우리는 많은 대화를 나누며 좋은 파트너가 되도록 하겠습니다.
 작년에 매우 인기가 많았습니다.
 그래서 앞으로도 그들과 소통할 수 있었으면 좋겠습니다.</p>

 ខ្ញុំពិតជាពេញចិត្តចំពោះការសង្កត់ធ្ងន់លើការសង្កត់ធ្ងន់លើការអភិវឌ្ឍន៍វិជ្ជាជីវៈនៅក្នុងក្រុមប្រឹក្សាភិបាលហើយគំរូគ្រូបង្វឹកបណ្តុះបណ្តាលអាចមានប្រសិទ្ធិភាពខ្លាំងដរាបណាមានផែនការអភិវឌ្ឍប្រកបដោយចីរភាពដែលអមដំណើរវគ្គបណ្តុះបណ្តាលនិងមិនមែនជាគំរូគ្រូបង្វឹក - គ្រូបង្វឹកឡើយ។
 ដំណាក់កាលចាប់ផ្តើមបានបរាជ័យពីព្រោះការចាប់ផ្តើមកម្មវិធីរថភ្លើងនិងឡានក្រុងមានតម្លៃថ្លៃណាស់ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំគ្រាន់តែចង់ធ្វើឱ្យប្រាកដថាយើងមានផែនការប្រកបដោយនិរន្តរភាពនៅនឹងកន្លែងវិនិយោគដែលមានអតិបរមា។
 ទាក់ទងនឹងការដឹកជញ្ជូនខ្ញុំចង់បានចលនាមួយដើម្បីស្នើសុំថវិកានេះរួមមានឬសន្មតថាចាប់ពីឆ្នាំសិក្សា 21-22 នឹងមិនមានការចំណាយលើការដឹកជញ្ជូនបន្ថែមសម្រាប់សិស្សរបស់យើងទេ។
 រដ្ឋាភិបាលនឹងដាក់ស្នើផែនការដ៏ទូលំទូលាយដែលរៀបចំសំណើរដឹកជញ្ជូនសម្រាប់តំបន់នេះគិតត្រឹមថ្ងៃទី 1 ខែសីហា។
 មូលហេតុដែលខ្ញុំបានបន្ថែមនៅចុងបញ្ចប់គឺដោយសារតែ
 ខ្ញុំបាន heard មនុស្សជាច្រើននិយាយថាក្មេងៗជិះម៉ូតូ MBTA មានន័យថាយឺតហើយដែលមិនអាចជឿទុកចិត្តបានហើយឪពុកម្តាយកំពុងស្វែងរកវិធីផ្សេងទៀតដើម្បីឱ្យកូន ៗ របស់ពួកគេទៅសាលារៀនព្រោះពួកគេមិនទុកចិត្តឡានក្រុង MBTA ។
 សូមពិចារណាថាមានសិស្សដទៃទៀតដែលពឹងផ្អែកយ៉ាងខ្លាំងទៅលើឡានក្រុង MBTA ទាំងនោះឆ្លងកាត់ឆ្លងកាត់
 ដោយផ្ទាល់ខ្ញុំមិនបានដឹងអំពីវិធីផ្សេងៗគ្នាដើម្បីទៅធ្វើការហើយជិះឡានក្រុងប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំមិនចង់ព្រងើយកន្តើយទេដែលមានសមាជិកសហគមន៍ដែលស្ថិតក្នុងស្ថានភាពនេះ។
 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំសង្ឃឹមថាយើងនឹងដោះស្រាយបញ្ហាចរាចរណ៍ម្តងទៀតហើយសង្ឃឹមថាអ្នករាល់គ្នានឹងសហការជាមួយក្រុមហ៊ុនឡានក្រុងភាគខាងកើតគឺនាយកដ្ឋានប៉ូលីសនិងទីភ្នាក់ងារផ្សេងទៀត។
 យើងសង្ឃឹមថាសហគមន៍អាចរកវិធីល្អបំផុតទៅមុខ។
 វេជ្ជបណ្ឌិត Cushing ខ្ញុំក៏ប្រាប់អ្នកផងដែរខ្ញុំចាំបានថាការសន្ទនាអំពីកាំមួយឬពីរម៉ាយល៍និងវត្ថុដូចនោះដែរអំពីការមិនមានកាំនៅកម្រិតបឋម។
 នៅពេលដែលលោក Murphy បាននិយាយអំពីមត្តេយ្យធ្វើជាករណីលើកលែងខ្ញុំគិតថាខ្ញុំចាប់ផ្តើមគិតថាប្រសិនបើបានអនុវត្ត
 មួយពាន់ធៀបនឹងពីរពាន់ឬអ្វីមួយដូចនោះ។
 ទោះយ៉ាងណាអ្នកនៅតែត្រូវយកកូនរបស់អ្នកនៅកន្លែងណាមួយដែលអ្នកមិនធ្លាប់មានពីមុនមក។
 តើអ្នកអនុវត្តយ៉ាងម៉េចហើយជានិស្សិតដែលមានលក្ខណៈជាសិស្សថ្នាក់មត្តេយ្យក្នុងរយៈពេល 4 កាំ?
 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំគិតថាមានការពិភាក្សាជាច្រើនអំពីការដឹកជញ្ជូនដែលចាំបាច់ត្រូវដោះស្រាយ។
 ប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំសង្ឃឹមថាថវិកាឆ្លុះបញ្ចាំងយ៉ាងច្បាស់ថានិស្សិតនឹងមិនមានការលំបាកក្នុងការចូលរៀននៅឆ្នាំក្រោយទេ។
 តើអ្នកចង់ទូរស័ព្ទឬខ្ញុំគួរសួរសំណួរផ្សេងទៀតទេ?</p>

 그래서 저는 경영진과 재무 부서가 이를 인지하고 있는지 확인하고 싶었습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4694.075s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 최종 가격을 알게 되면 재무부서에서 이를 알 수 있을 것 같습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4699.617s">[David Murphy]</a>: អញ្ចឹងខ្ញុំគិតថារឿងតែមួយគត់ដែលខ្ញុំចង់និយាយគឺ Merrick,
 ខ្ញុំយល់ថាចលនានេះមានន័យថាយើងមិនចង់អោយសិស្សណាម្នាក់ឱ្យពឹងផ្អែកលើការចំណាយ MBTA បានទិញដោយការចំណាយផ្ទាល់ខ្លួនរបស់ពួកគេដើម្បីទៅសាលារៀន។
 ឥឡូវខ្ញុំគិតថាមានវិធីផ្សេងៗគ្នាដើម្បីស្វែងរកសំណួរនេះ។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាវិធីសន្សំសំចៃបំផុតគឺបន្ថែមឡានក្រុងលឿងយ៉ាងហោចណាស់ឡានក្រុងពណ៌លឿងមួយផ្សេងទៀត។
 ដូចខ្ញុំបាននិយាយនេះអាចមានសេរីភាព។
 តាមទ្រឹស្តីនេះអាចជាអព្យាក្រឹតថវិកា។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាលើសពីនេះវាអាចមានឡានក្រុងលឿងច្រើនជាងមួយហើយបន្ទាប់មកវាអាចមានឡានក្រុងផ្សេងទៀតប៉ុន្តែមួយដែលប្រាកដជាមានផលប៉ះពាល់ខ្លះលើថវិកា។
 ហើយបញ្ហាមួយទៀតដែលខ្ញុំគិតថាយើងត្រូវដោះស្រាយគឺថានឹងមាននិស្សិតដែលចង់បានការបញ្ចុះតម្លៃ MBTA ឆ្លងកាត់។
 ខ្ញុំមិនទទួលយកញត្តិស្នើឱ្យសហរដ្ឋអាមេរិកបញ្ចប់ភាពជាដៃគូរបស់យើងជាមួយ MBTA ហើយឈប់ផ្តល់ជូន MBTA ឆ្លងកាត់ទេពីព្រោះប្រសិនបើនិស្សិតណាម្នាក់ចង់ទិញលិខិតឆ្លងដែនដោយហេតុផលណាមួយ
 យើងពិតជាចង់អោយសិស្សរបស់យើងអាចទទួលបានកាតបញ្ចុះតម្លៃដូចសិស្សនៅស្រុកសាលាផ្សេងទៀត។
 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំគិតថាយើងនឹងបន្តកម្មវិធីនេះប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំគិតថាជាមូលដ្ឋានយើងគ្រាន់តែត្រូវការពិនិត្យមើលថាតើនិស្សិតកំពុងប្រើសន្លឹកបៀរ។
 ដូច្នេះប្រសិនបើពួកគេពឹងផ្អែកលើវាយើងត្រូវបង់ប្រាក់សម្រាប់ MBTA Pass ឬផ្តល់ជម្រើសជំនួសសិស្សដើម្បីទៅសាលារៀន។
 ឥឡូវខ្ញុំចង់
 វាទាំងអស់គឺអាស្រ័យលើចំនួនសំបុត្រដែលយើងលក់និងចំនួនសិស្សទិញពួកគេដោយផ្អែកលើពួកគេ។
 ដូច្នេះតើផ្លូវមួយណាដែលជាឡានក្រុងលឿង?
 ពិតជាមានច្រើនស្រទាប់ក្នុងការនេះប៉ុន្តែវាពិតជាមានការណែនាំច្បាស់លាស់ពីគណៈកម្មការ។
 ប្រសិនបើយើងមានបញ្ហាក្នុងការប្រតិបត្តិមិនថាមកពីទស្សនៈថវិកាឬខាងដឹកនាំសាស្ត្រក៏ដោយយើងនឹងត្រឡប់មកវិញ។
 សម្រាប់ខ្ញុំវាអាចមានក្រុមនិស្សិតមួយក្រុម
 នៅពេលដែលយើងនិយាយថាមិនអីទេអ្នកទិញកាតនេះពីព្រោះអ្នកត្រូវការវាសម្រាប់សាលារៀនពីព្រោះអ្នកត្រូវការវាសម្រាប់ការងារពីព្រោះអ្នកគ្រាន់តែចង់បានកាត MBTA ដែលបានបញ្ចុះ។
 ពួកគេនឹងនិយាយថាស្តាប់បុរសខ្ញុំគ្រាន់តែចង់បានលិខិតឆ្លងដែនប៉ុណ្ណោះ។
 នេះជា 30 ដុល្លាររបស់ខ្ញុំ។
 ខ្ញុំនឹងព្រួយបារម្ភអំពីការទៅសាលារៀន។
 ត្រង់ចំណុចនេះខ្ញុំមិនគិតថាយើងកំពុងរំលោភគោលនយោបាយទេ។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាយើងបានរកឃើញនិស្សិតម្នាក់ដែលបានសំរេចចិត្តយក MBTA ហើយទៅថ្នាក់ដោយមិនគិតពីថាតើគាត់នៅពេលវេលាឬអត់។
 ជាថ្មីម្តងទៀតខ្ញុំគិតថាចេតនាគឺច្បាស់ណាស់។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាយើងនឹងធ្វើអ្វីគ្រប់យ៉ាងដែលយើងអាចធ្វើបានដើម្បីពង្រឹងវា។
 ប្រសិនបើយើងរកឃើញខ្លួនយើងនៅក្នុងស្ថានភាពដែលវាមិនអាចធ្វើបានធម្មតាមិនអាចធ្វើទៅបានពីទស្សនៈថវិកាឬដោយមានទស្សនៈវិស័យក៏ដោយយើងនឹងត្រូវរក្សាការសន្ទនាបើកចំហជាមួយគណៈកម្មការ។
 ប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំពិតជាយល់ពីចេតនា។
 ដូចខ្ញុំបាននិយាយថាយើងនឹងព្យាយាមឱ្យអស់ពីសមត្ថភាពដើម្បីធ្វើវា។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4879.947s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 그렇다면 솔루션이 어떻게 제공되기를 원하시나요?
 Graham 부통령과 Murphy는 우리에게 8월 1일이 아닌 6월 1일을 보게 될 것이라고 알려주었습니다.
 나는 그것이 분명하다고 생각합니다.
 8월 1일을 언급하셨는데, 제가 무엇을 지원하는지, 무엇을 사용할 수 있는지, 언제 지원하는지 알고 싶습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4905.178s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 따라서 예산에는 연구에 비용이 전혀 들지 않는다는 가정이 포함됩니다.
 운송 계획과 전략을 검토하는 것은 여전히 ​​불가능합니다.
 8월 1일까지의 기간입니다.
 더 구체적으로 말하면, MBTA는 모두에게 무료인가요, 아니면 "노란 버스" 전략이 있고 이것이 우리가 바꾸는 것입니까?
 그리고 1~2마일 이내에 이 모든 것이 예산에 분명히 영향을 미치고 예산이 승인된 후 학군에서 일어난 일에도 영향을 미칩니다.
 하지만 예산에는 학생들에게 비용을 지불하지 않고도 학교에 갈 수 있는 능력이 반영되어야 합니다.
 알았지, 머피?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4960.204s">[David Murphy]</a>: 글쎄요, 제가 생각하기에 유일한 반대 의견은 우리가 지금 누구에게도 학비를 내라고 요구하고 있지 않다는 것입니다. 이것을 지적하려는 것은 아닙니다.
 실제로 MBTA 버스를 타는 학생들도 있는데 우리 학교 노란색 버스에는 자리가 없어 자신이 사는 곳, 가족이 사는 곳, 기타 상황에 따라 선택을 해야 하는 경우도 있다.
 물론 그들은 학교에 가는 데 비용을 지불하지만, 귀하가 지불하는 MBTA 버스 비용을 지불하는 한 MBTA 버스를 타지 못하게 하는 것은 교육구 정책이 아닙니다.
 그래서 우리는 현재 학생 인구에 대한 데이터를 수집하고 잠시 동안 이를 살펴보고 MBTA가 우리가 판매하는 금액을 초과하는지, 우리가 가지고 있는 한계를 수용하는지 확인하고 싶다고 생각합니다.
 그래서 노란색 버스의 용량을 늘리는 측면에서 비용을 줄일 수 있는지 알아보겠습니다.
 그래서 제 생각에는 MBTA를 판매할 때 이를 검토해야 한다고 생각합니다. 앞서 말했듯이 우리 학생들이 할인 혜택을 받도록 장려하고 싶지 않기 때문입니다.
 그래서 카드 데이터를 수집해야 할 것 같아요.
 카드는 선호에 따라 사용됩니까, 아니면 선호 또는 비선호에 따라 구매됩니까?
 학교에 가는 또 다른 방법.
 그래서 목표는 분명하다고 생각해요.
 말씀드린 대로 우리는 괜찮을 것이고, 정부 기관에 부딪히거나 스타트업이 불가능해 보일 때 돌아올 것입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5066.605s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: McLaughlin 의원들은 이 운동에 동참하고 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5068.707s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: 이 움직임에 감사드립니다.
 분명히 말하자면,
 어떻게 보면 그냥 그런 게 있는지 확인하려는 것 같지만 반가운 문제는 등록금을 내는 학생들이 있고, 그들 대부분이 경제적으로 불리한 상황에 있다는 점이다.
 아마도 반경 1마일 이내일 수도 있고, 적어도 반경 1마일 이내일 수도 있습니다.
 McGilney 고등학교 근처 McGlynn 지역의 마일리지를 고려하고 있다면 가족에게 큰 영향을 미칠 수 있는 할인 가격으로 한 달에 30달러를 지불할 여유가 없기 때문에 걸어서 학교에 가십시오.
 내 생각엔 그게 공평한 것 같아
 윤리는 성명서이며 우리의 예산은 우리의 가치를 반영합니다. 역사적으로 학교 위원회가 단상 반대편에 앉아 있었고 학생들은 그에 대한 비용을 지불해야 했다는 사실에 놀랐습니다.
 학교 교통은 특히 못하는 학생이기 때문에 결석률을 생각하면 그게 큰 영향을 미치기 때문에 MBTA는 알지만 그건 재정위원회에 맡기고 그렇게 합시다.
 아시다시피 일단 평가하면 다음 또는 마지막 회의에서 비용 편익 분석에 대해 더 자세히 알아볼 수 있습니다.
 그러나 나는 그것을 제쳐두고 그레이엄 씨의 움직임을 지지하고 싶습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5169.127s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 6월 1일을 검토합니다.
 이것은 정확합니다.
 어떤 어린이도 자신의 교통비를 지불할 필요가 없습니다.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5205.937s">[David Murphy]</a>: 죄송합니다. 이해할 수 없습니다.
 그가 계속하기 전에 이런 질문을 했어야 했는데, 좀 더 명확한 질문을 하고 싶었습니다.
 네, 현재 정책에 따라 노란색 번호판을 제거하더라도 해당 학생들은 노란색 번호판을 받을 수 없기 때문에 중등학교 반경 3km를 설정하자는 제안이 있습니다.
 하지만 MBTA 카드가 무슨 역할을 하는지는 모르겠지만, 학생이 4마일 떨어진 학교에 산다면 우리는 그 학생에게 무료 교통수단을 제공할 것입니다.
 학교에 가는 방법을 생각할 때 비슷한 규칙이 있나요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5248.902s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: 아니요, 내 말은, 법에 따라 학생들이 학교에 걸어가야 한다면 나는 이에 동의하고 계속할 것입니다.
 이제 저는 여러분에게 그 사과를 직접 한 입 먹어보라고 요청하는 것이 아닙니다.
 제가 걱정하는 것은 학교에서 3마일(3km) 이상 떨어진 곳에 거주하며 수업료를 지불해야 하는 사람들입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5273.365s">[David Murphy]</a>: 학교에서 또는 학교 밖에서 2마일 이상 떨어진 곳에 거주하는 경우 누군가는 무료 노란색 버스를 타기 시작했고 다른 누군가는 MBTA 교통비로 한 달에 30달러를 지불해야 한다는 말을 들었습니다.
 이건 역겹다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5289.571s">[David Murphy]</a>: 그것이 우리가 해결하려는 문제라면, 나는 그것이 합리적인 방법이라고 생각합니다.
 이것이 우리가 관찰할 수 있는 것입니다.
 법에는 6세 이상의 사람은 자동차를 운전할 수 없다고 명시되어 있습니다.
 그렇기 때문에 전국적으로 일관되게 현행 마일리지 규정을 시행하는 법률이 있는 것입니다.
 그것은 의미가 있고 우리는 그것을 할 수 있습니다.
 하지만 귀하의 답변을 보면 불평등이 무엇을 의미하는지에 대해 우리 모두가 동의하며 그것이 우리가 해결하고 싶은 문제라는 것을 알 수 있습니다.
 이 목표를 달성하기 위해 우리는 투표 계획을 개발할 것입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5326.754s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: 우리가 명확하게 논의하고 있는지 확실하지 않기 때문에 이 정보에 대해 논평할 수 있습니다. 적어도 그것이 제가 느끼고 명확히 하고 싶은 것입니다.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5336.458s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: McLaughlin 의원의 요점은 분명합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5341.68s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: 감사합니다
 제 생각엔 경제적으로 어려운 학생들이 돈을 내야 한다는 것이 제 문제인 것 같아요
 학교까지의 교통.
 따라서 그것이 2마일, 2마일, 1마일 또는 우리가 제안하는 무엇이든 상관없습니다.
 나는 과거에 교사들이 학생들을 MBTA에 등록시키기 위해 비용을 지불했다는 것을 알고 있습니다.
 여권.
 따라서 머피는 반드시 특정 운동에 기초한 것이 아니라 더 많은 관심이 필요할 수도 있고, 이 운동을 추가하면 MBTA가 도시의 교실을 통과할 수 있고 취업 기회를 얻을 수도 있다고 생각합니다.
 학교까지의 교통편이 허용될 수 있습니다.
 나에게 중요한 가장 중요한 부분은 다음과 같습니다: 질문을 하십니까?
 이것은 정확합니다.
 이런 의미에서 우리는 경제적 어려움에 초점을 맞추고 있습니까?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5405.854s">[David Murphy]</a>: 아, 이 청원은... 모두를 위한 청원인 것 같아요.
 네, 그런 것 같아요.
 예, 이는 단순한 경제적 어려움보다 더 광범위하지만 반경 2마일 이내의 학생들에게는 적용되지 않습니다.
 이는 Gresham 박사가 GPS를 사용하여 그래프 데이터의 관점을 결정하는 것에 대해 이야기하는 것과 유사한 데이터 포인트를 제공하며 우리는 그들이 무료로 학교에 다닐 수 있도록 해야 합니다.
 노동절 이전과 마찬가지로 버스가 본당에 배치되자 최대한 많은 학생들을 수용할 수 있었습니다.
 가능하다면 이것이 가장 따라하기 쉬운 가이드가 될 것이라고 생각합니다.
 이것을 보고 잘 말하면 명절 전에 우리가 운행하는 버스는 우리 학생들의 15%만 운행하고 있습니다.
 도시의 다양한 지역을 운행하려면 6대의 새로운 버스가 필요합니다.
 그러면 아마도 우리는 지금 당장은 지속 가능한 방법이 없기 때문에 다시 재건해야 한다고 말할 것입니다.
 따라서 우리는 경제적 어려움을 겪고 있는 사람들을 대상으로 하기 때문에 이제 비용을 절감해야 할 수도 있다고 Ekrövlen은 말했습니다.
 다시 한 번 말씀드리지만, 결과가 어떻게 될지는 정확히 알 수 없지만, 우리는 분명한 방향을 갖고 있다고 생각하고 앞으로 나아갈 수 있어 기쁩니다.</p>

 그런 다음 내 마지막 의견은 단순히 돈 낭비가 싫다는 것입니다.
 Caroline 잔디 욕실 복원 프로젝트에 대한 자금 지원은 고등학교의 장기적인 요구 사항을 진정으로 해결하는 마스터 플랜이 개발될 때까지 계속됩니다.
 그것은 많은 돈입니다.
 총액은 25만 달러 정도인데, 우리말로 따지면 아주 큰 액수다.
 10명의 에너지 근로자와 마찬가지로 우리는 예산 내에서 많은 교사를 접할 수 없습니다.
 명확한 건설 계획이 없는 비용 외에도 다른 우선 순위가 많이 있습니다.
 앞서도 말했듯이, 명확한 평면도를 갖는 것이 중요합니다.
 저는 아직 평가되지 않은 대형 건물의 건축 요구를 충족하기 위해 우리와 함께 제공되거나 제공되는 유형의 지역 사회 자금을 지원할 수 없었습니다.

 일부 전문 직원은 특정 기술, 특정 라이센스나 요구 사항을 개발하고 있다고 반드시 느끼지는 않는다고 생각합니다. 그래서 저는 그 점을 언급하고 싶습니다.
 아시다시피, 교육에 매우 중요한 참여와 전문성 개발에 관심을 갖는 것만으로도 교육의 일부이지만 많은 사람들이 교사를 잃었다고 생각합니다.

 អ្នកត្រួតពិនិត្យពិតជាចូលចិត្តពិន្ទុ MCAS របស់គាត់អ្នកដឹងថាពួកគេគឺជាវិធានការណ៍មួយដែលថាតើគាត់ចូលចិត្ត MCAS ឬអត់ពួកគេគឺជាវិធានការមួយហើយវាសំខាន់ណាស់។
 ប៉ុន្តែនេះគឺជាគោលនយោបាយជាក់លាក់មួយដែលជះឥទ្ធិពលដល់ការវាស់។
 ទេខ្ញុំមានន័យថាអត់ទេខ្ញុំមិនបានស្នើសុំរបាយការណ៍ទេប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំដឹងពីបទពិសោធន៍នេះពិតជាត្រឹមត្រូវមែន។
 ប្រសិនបើអ្នកនឹកឡានក្រុងអ្នកនឹងមិនអាចទៅសាលារៀនបានទេ។
 ជាការពិតប្រសិនបើខ្ញុំនឹកឡានក្រុងហើយមិនមានការដឹកជញ្ជូនខ្ញុំមិនអាចដើរទៅសាលារៀនបានទេ
 ខ្ញុំប្រាកដថាកុមារជាច្រើននឹងតូចចិត្តប្រសិនបើពួកគេខកខានឡានក្រុង។
 ប៉ុន្តែមិនមានឡានក្រុងសម្រាប់កុមារទាំងអស់នៅក្នុងកាំពីរម៉ាយលនោះទេ។
 ដូច្នេះនៅពេលដែលយើងមានភ្លៀងធ្លាក់ខ្លាំងមានភ្លៀងធ្លាក់ដ៏គួរឱ្យភ័យខ្លាចដែលយើងធ្លាប់ទទួលបានមុនពេលឡើងកំដៅផែនដីរុញសីតុណ្ហភាពចូលដល់ទសវត្សទី 70, ប្រសិនបើអ្នកជិះឡានក្រុង,
 វាមិនដូចជាអ្នកមិនយកឡានក្រុងហើយត្រូវដើរយ៉ាងហោចណាស់ 40 នាទីដើម្បីទៅសាលារៀន។
 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំមិនមានបញ្ហាទេ។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6537.591s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: 제가 원하는 것은... 참가자 여러분, 감사합니다.
 감사합니다
 참가자 Kretz와 참가자 Van der Kloot가 합류했습니다.
 크레츠 참가자 여러분, 저와 상의해 주세요.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6554.746s">[Kathy Kreatz]</a>: 좋아요, 시작해 보겠습니다.
 음, 오늘 밤 우리가 한 여행에 관해 머피는 우리에게 모든 학생을 위해 노란색 버스를 사용할 것인지, 아니면 모든 학생을 위해 MBTA 교통 패스를 구입할 것인지와 같이 다양한 비용을 설명하는 보고서를 제공했습니까?
 이 제안을 예산 시간별로 분석하여 예산에 얼마나 적합한지 확인할 수 있습니까?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6595.799s">[David Murphy]</a>: 나는 고등학교에서 2마일 이내에 있는 학생들을 위해 MBTA 카드를 구입할 수 있는 옵션을 없애는 계획을 마련하려고 노력할 것이라고 생각합니다.
 그 시간을 어떻게 보낼지, 시간이 좀 걸릴 것 같은데, 그렇게 말하면 안 되지만, 노란색 버스의 수용 인원을 늘리는 방안이 되어야 한다고 말하고 싶습니다.
 우리는 X개의 MBTA 허가증을 보유하고 있으며 교육구는 합격하고 통학할 수 있는 사람들의 비용을 부담합니다.
 다른 협회에서는 정가를 지불하고 MBTA 학생 구매 기준을 결정하기 위해 수집할 수 있는 데이터를 확인하는 데 도움을 줍니다.
 그래서 저는 그렇다고 생각합니다. 우리는 모든 지표를 살펴봐야 합니다.
 8월 1일 이전에 알았더라면 이해했을 것 같아요
 우리는 이것이 재정적으로나 행정적으로 우리가 할 수 있는 일이 아니라는 점을 위원회에 알릴 것입니다.
 못해서 토하고 사과하기보다는 위원회에 알렸다고 생각합니다.
 우리가 말할 수 있는 건 우리가 하기 전에 당신이 알고 있다는 것 뿐인 것 같아요
 이 모든 것이 학생들이 티켓을 대량으로 구매하는 것을 방지합니다.
 지금까지 MME의 경우입니다.
 McLaughlin 씨, 그렇다면 경제적으로 불리한 상황에 처한 학생들을 어떻게 대상으로 삼을 것인지 생각해 볼 수 있습니다.
 그래서 몇 가지 어려움이 있다고 생각합니다. 하지만 제가 말했듯이 추세는 분명하며 우리는 그 방향으로 나아가야 하며 이를 달성하기 위해 최선을 다할 것입니다.</p>

 우리는 어디로 가고 싶은지 결정해야 합니다.
 새로운 위원회를 선출할까요?
 당신이 관심을 갖고 있는 사람에게 보여주세요.
 이제 Jenny의 우려를 이해하므로 위원회를 구성해야 합니다.
 또한 건물이 어린이 친화적인지 확인하고 싶습니다.
 그래서 내 생각엔 하나 있는 것 같아
 저는 아무것도 하지 않는 것과 건물을 양호한 상태로 유지하기 위해 필요한 개선을 하는 것 사이에 좋은 방법이 있다고 생각합니다.
 이 양식은 학생이 사용합니다.
 하지만 가장 중요한 것은 비전위원회의 구성, 필요한 것, 생각하고 있는 기간을 결정하는 것입니다.
 어쩌면 6월 말이 시작하기에 적절한 시기가 아닐 수도 있습니다.
 나는 본다
 하지만 우리는 다음 학년이 지날 때까지 기다리기보다는 9월 초에 집중할 준비가 되어 있어야 합니다.</p>

 난 그냥 원해요
 내 말은, 나는 캠퍼스의 일부 화장실을 개조하고 업데이트해야 하기 때문에 개조하는 데 매우 찬성한다는 뜻입니다.
 좀 더 세부적인 계획이 필요하다는 점에는 동의하지만 건물 전체에서 가장 현대적인 욕실은 과학 구역에 있습니다.
 이것은 실제 현대적인 욕실을 갖춘 전체 단지를 위한 것입니다.
 따라서 모든 학생들이 이 분야에서 공부하는 것은 아닙니다.
 그래서 2019년에는 약간의 자금이 할당되고 모든 우여곡절을 감안할 때 적어도 일부 개혁이 개선되기를 바랍니다.
 이 화장실 중 일부에 아멘.
 나는 이것이 매우 중요하다고 생각합니다.
 그리고 아시다시피 저는 학생들의 요구 사항을 생각하고 그들이 현대적인 욕실을 갖기를 원한다고 말했습니다.
 그래서 저는 우리가 이 돈을 받았을 때 헌신했다는 점을 위원회에 상기시키고 싶습니다.</p>
