    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=208.272s">[David Murphy]</a>:  Thank you, Superintendent, Mayor, members of the school committee.
 It's a pleasure to be with you again this evening.
 for our fifth committee of the whole meeting focused on the FY22 budget.
 As the superintendent mentioned, tonight we'll be focused on elements of the central office, specifically the offices that are under both the superintendent and my own supervision.
 As we go through the beginning of the program, as we have each time, we'll be looking at the org chart and talking specifically about the offices whose budgets are
 are here in light of the fact that these are the offices that myself and the superintendent work most closely with.
 While Dr. Kuching, Ms.
 Galussi, Ms.
 Bowen are here, with the exception of Director McLaughlin, we will be really the only presenters and speakers tonight.
 But certainly we'll be eager to answer any questions that you have, both with respect to the offices that we are focusing on tonight and anything else that we've covered
 over the course of the last several weeks.
 And as I mentioned in my message to the committee, both last night and a few minutes ago, we will be having a budget update on the school committee agenda this coming Monday, May 24th.
 And we'll certainly be picking up questions and comments at that point, incorporating and taking in your feedback.
 And that will go into the development of the recommendations that come before you.
 prior to your June 1st statutory hearing.
 So with that, I will start, as we always do, with the timeline for our budget process, beginning with the development of the district's strategic goals and priorities, leading to a series of, some administrators might say, seemingly endless administrative meetings internally, in which we vet various proposals and comments, questions, and suggestions
 principles and evening, but have not been following along for each of the various budget presentations, both at regular school committee meetings, budget subcommittee and the committee of the whole meetings.
 This is where we are right now leading up to that June 1st public hearing in which members of the community will be invited to speak either for or against, or a favorite for those who follow municipal presentations, those wishing to speak neither for nor against.
 the budget in part or in whole.
 And again, that will take place on June 1st, but there will be a budget update on Monday, an opportunity to comment and engage in further discussion.
 We've used the org chart in each of these presentations, just as by way of showing folks, perhaps outside of the Medford Public Schools community,
 which area of the organization we're focused on in this particular meeting.
 So this is the overall org chart showing all the various offices and departments reporting up to the superintendent.
 And then these are the areas that we'll be discussing tonight.
 So you can see it's primarily the areas in my own portfolio, as well as those reporting directly to the superintendent.
 And you see the curvy arrow there on the right of the screen.
 which is indicating a reorganization of sorts that we'll be proposing as part of the FY22 budget, and that's something I'll be going into greater detail about shortly.
 So as we've discussed in each of the budget presentations, the funding for the Metro Public Schools and the funding generally for school districts across Massachusetts comes from various sources.
 What we often refer to as the Chapter 70 allocation, which is the
 The state contribution under state law coming out of ed reform law of 1993 and the funding that each school community and district are entitled to.
 The local contribution, which is the revenue generated from at the local level that is air marked for the for the school department, which in Medford is a very sizable portion of that of the overall
 operating budget.
 And then the sort of extenuating circumstances under which we're currently operating mean we have a significant influx of federal funding coming in as a result of the COVID-related legislation that has come in.
 And that is coupled with the sort of standing external funds that come in on a year-in and year-out basis, particularly in the area of special education, which we discussed at length at the May 6th Committee of the Whole when we heard from the Office of Pupil Services.
 We've said that throughout the FY22 budget, we've asked those contributing to the development of this budget, meaning our department heads and our principals, to focus essentially on three primary buckets of areas in which we're asking them what are their budgetary priorities, what are their needs, what are their challenges.
 First is personnel and staffing.
 And the committee certainly said before that when we're talking about school budgets, we're almost always talking about people.
 We're an organization made up of people, educating people, hoping to make them better people and people who are positioned to do well in their post-secondary lives.
 But that is always going to be the largest chunk of our budget because, you know, as we say sometimes in school finance, we're not focused on widgets.
 We're focused on people in a community, and that's always going to be the largest chunk.
 Materials and infrastructure, particularly under the challenging conditions under which we're operating, are always going to represent
 another, albeit smaller, aspect of the budget.
 And training and professional development, which everything is, we are looking at everything through a post-COVID context, but for training and professional development, when we think about the ways in which some of the inequities, both within public education and society at large, have come into sharper relief as a result of the experience that we've all lived through, we are thinking very much in that context when we talk about
 what are our professional development and training priorities, and what is it that we're looking to invest in.
 And particularly when we're talking about the superintendent's priorities, while much of what we're planning will be supported by external funding, given that the budget development process is the opportunity to really look at the organization as a whole, see how we're structured, how we're organized, what it is that we're pursuing, what are our discrete challenges, what are our long-term overarching challenges,
 This really is an opportunity to sort of pull the veil back on all of the Medford Public Schools.
 And my hope would be that throughout these committee of the whole presentations, as we've heard from the various directors and school leaders, my hope would be that both for the school committee and the members of the community who are either watching this in real time or perhaps watching it subsequent to the presentations, you'll see the effort toward transparency that we have employed to try to demonstrate for the community exactly what it is that we're doing.
 And I hope also
 the rationale behind these priorities.
 And this slide talks a little bit about that rationale in that these are the questions that were posed that led to the development of these priorities and that we're thinking about what are the targeted and intensive interventions that we can invest in to help reduce or eliminate the learning or opportunity gaps that have either been caused by or exacerbated by the disruption to instruction that our students have faced as a result of
 the COVID-19 pandemic.
 And so there will come a time when our budgetary priorities and our goals are not informed fully by this experience and the disruption that our students have lived through.
 At least I certainly hope that's the case.
 One of the sort of constant refrains that we go back to is we're looking to make investments that will ensure our students' academic careers are not defined by this experience.
 And hopefully if we make these investments and we execute on them wisely, that will be the case.
 But for right now,
 coming out of these, as cliche as it might sound, these unprecedented circumstances, we are looking to see how do we use the funding that's available to us from the local, state, and federal levels to try to put them in the best position possible despite the chaos that we've all lived through.
 So on April 26th, we presented to the school committee the projections that we were looking at based on the preliminary information that we had.
 uh, leading into these budget presentations.
 And we've estimated that, uh, the necessary increase in the budget would be somewhere between 3.4 and $5.8 million.
 Recognizing that there are a significant number of variables that are, uh, essentially not clear while variable one, there are restrictions on federal funding flowing in that are still not particularly clear.
 And I appreciate the mayor's comments to that effect.
 last night, but we're continuing to engage in a very constructive dialogue with our partners in the city government and reaching out to our partners at the state level and elsewhere to try to get clarity on that.
 I think at this point we feel comfortable that the priorities we've developed that we think of as having a strong nexus to the disruption caused by COVID will be essentially eligible expenses.
 It's a question of, from an administrative perspective, exactly how
 we'll go about processing those and exactly how realistic is it to do that.
 So I think we feel good about the priorities that we've identified as our COVID-related or potential ESSER-related priorities, but there's still a lot of clarity that needs to come into view in the coming weeks.
 In addition to that, we know we have fixed costs as every district does on a year-on-year basis.
 These are costs that are related to contractual obligations or
 other situations that have essentially predated the development of this budget, but we know that they're going to lead to an increase in costs.
 Other variables also include the fact that we have upwards of nine collective bargaining agreements that are expiring either at the conclusion of this school year or the conclusion of the summer.
 And so that's certainly a factor that we have to take into account as we work through the development of this budget.
 This is just information related to those external funding, the numbers the committee has seen several times before, so I won't
 belabor it, but we estimate about a $7.6 million ESSER budget over the next several years.
 And so I wouldn't say that we necessarily see that as needing to be expended in equal installments over the three or four year period that we have.
 But I would say that we want to be mindful of the fact that we're going to have additional data that will hopefully point us to more strategic uses of the funding as time goes on.
 So it may be the case that some of the more immediate expenses are in the short term, but the better use of the funding could be in year two or year three.
 And for that reason, we are looking to be, I'm not sure I would use the word conservative, but certainly cautious and cognizant of the implications of using that funding.
 And the fact is, as you've heard me say several times, these are one-time funds and the ESSER funding will not last forever.
 And so we have to be mindful of the uses
 being taking care to not create unnecessary structural deficits, and at the same time, making sure that we're being responsive to the urgent needs of students.
 And so where we strike that equilibrium is a big part of the conversations that we have been having and that we will be having.
 So I'm going to pause for one second before we move on to buildings and grounds and just talk a little bit about what you'll see over the next couple of slides in this, but I'm glad that I flashed to it quickly so that I can tell
 Mr. McLaughlin that he's on next as I continue to babble for another minute or so.
 But the departments that you're seeing starting with buildings, we're going to start with buildings and grounds and then move to the more umbrella offices of the superintendent's office and the office of finance and operations.
 And if you think back to the organizational chart that we saw at the beginning of the presentation, you can see that for both myself and Dr. Edouard-Vincent, there are a lot of priorities and funding and strategic investments
 and proposals that cut across the different departments and offices that you've already heard from.
 And that's a good thing because what we don't want to do is present a budget to you in the form of 25 siloed or overly departmentalized mini organizations.
 We want common themes and common strategic priorities that cut across.
 And so what you'll see in the bullets that we've identified are pieces that are either reflective of those priorities
 or operational pieces that are meant to put us in a position that we'll be able to actually pursue those priorities and do so successfully.
 Similar to the information technology budget proposals that we discussed in last night's committee of the whole, a large portion, arguably all, frankly, of the buildings and grounds priorities, the year maintenance issue,
 uh, that is essentially routine.
 I think routine was the word that we used in the technology presentation.
 That's something that we typically are going to incorporate one way or another into our operating budget.
 Um, something that is a one-time expense and I'm using the term one time in the context of municipal budgeting.
 And so one time could mean every 10 years, every 15 years, every 20 years, but certainly not on an annual basis.
 Um, that's every 20 years, but certainly not on an annual basis.
 That's something that we're going to look up to as a capital expense that we're going to try to keep off the operating budget for purposes of not creating some of those deficits that we've talked about.
 What we do when we have a large influx of federal funding, frankly, similar to how we handled the funding that came in during FY21, and to some extent in FY20 as well, is to try to address some of the most urgent priorities and needs that might in another context be considered a capital expense.
 but in light of the urgency, we're looking to just take what funding is available and make sure that that's addressed.
 That was certainly the case as is reflected in the buildings and grounds budget narrative that was provided to you today with regard to our HVAC repairs that we needed to expedite and accelerate at the beginning of this school year for purposes of getting students and staff back into the physical school buildings.
 And so I expressed my appreciation for Mr. McLaughlin and members of his team who partnered with
 the external experts that we brought in to make that a reality.
 The history as to how we got to the place where so much work was necessary, I think, has been addressed at length in previous meetings.
 But however we got here, we are in a much better position from an air quality perspective because that work was done throughout the course of this year.
 And now we're looking at some of the other heavy infrastructure pieces that may not land in the operating budget for FY22.
 but are critical priorities that need to be addressed in the near term.
 And I'm going to ask Mr. McLaughlin, if he could, to walk us through some of these.
 As we're talking about how these investments need to be made in the coming year or months.
 So John, do you want to take it from there and just start maybe with the generator and transformer electrical issues that we have
 been identified at the high school and at the Andrews and then we'll walk through some of the other pieces.
 From there we'll move on to finance operations in the superintendent's office and then we'll go to questions after that.

 我不知道。
 我已经激活了接入点。
 我，我，你知道，我为此准备了一段时间。
 不管怎样，所以，呃，是的，所以，呃，断路器或放大器，呃，反式，呃，断路器在安德鲁斯高中被更​​换了。
 所以我们回到了我们需要去的地方。
 嗯，它是，呃，我们对所有电气系统进行，嗯，安全，呃，检查，红外扫描的一部分。
 在高中，通过法学院，对不起。
 因此，我们能够用正常的运营预算来解决这个问题。
 所以我们知道，我们也知道应急发电机，它正准备出去进行 RFP。
 此外，变压器是梅德福高中原装设备。
 所以发生的事情是，是在什么时候，
 几年前我会有多氯联苯。
 所以我们必须去掉 PCB 并在上面涂上另一种油。
 最终发生的情况是橡胶密封件容易脱落。
 所以我正在获取报价。
 我有，今天刚收到，检查变压器。
 并确保我们能够回到我们需要去的地方。
 它的油量很低，但仍在运行，但它肯定是应该优先考虑的事情，因为它还运行着大约三分之一的功率。
 在梅德福高中。
 然后我们将准备好定价信息以继续推进。
 显然，这将是一个带有发电机的夏季项目，只要我们准备好承担该项目即可。
 今年我们进行了一些安全改进。
 我们有一个新的 Raptor 系统。
 当时我安装了所有显示器，并接受了新 Raptor 系统的培训。
 如果你不知道猛禽系统是你进来的地方，你给自己一个许可证，他们会扫描它。
 如果一切顺利，您将收到一个标签，并准备好前往总办公室办理您在我们任何学校需要办理的业务。
 因此，我们希望每三四年完成一次停车场。
 我应该说，通常是整个系统范围内的所有这些。
 停车场又被标记了，它们开始老化了。
 我们想做一些
 梅福德高中的调整，我们将就残疾人停车情况与该学校会面。
 我知道我们在谈论主入口时进行了这样的对话。
 我认为我们想要做的是搬到梅福德高中前面的残疾人专用点，并进入那里的残疾人坡道。
 所以，你知道，让我们回顾一下。
 我和
 Lungo-Koehn 市长上周表示，如果我需要帮助，我们在市政厅有交通部门，他们会非常乐意帮助我们。
 几年前，我们与他们会面，试图做出一些改进，但众所周知，过去的一年并不是我们通常处理的典型年份。
 柯蒂斯塔夫茨锅炉项目，所以去年冬天，锅炉开始泄漏。
 这些都是我们可能会在下周的小组委员会会议上讨论的问题。
 这就是为什么我们订购了一些需要重新安装的部件，即分段部件。
 因此，我们得到了两个部分，他们将更换它们，这应该可以阻止我们预期的泄漏。
 我们将不得不在这方面花费大量资金。
 和暖通空调的改进。
 所以我们知道我们做了很多这样的事情。
 我们目前正在打开空调。
 因此，存在与此相关的问题，某些特定区域需要我们聘请承包商来修复。
 根据法律规定，我们必须在 5 月 15 日之前提供供暖。
 所以这周是我们进行结算的一周。
 不幸的是，本周很热，你知道，这很愚蠢，但这周很热。
 教室里的一些老师感到有点不舒服，但我们正在努力解决。
 我们知道你在那里。
 我们将尽快出去处理所有需要做的事情。
 致电承包商。
 我只是想列出一份我们需要做的事情以及需要做的建筑物的清单。
 嗯，浴室改造项目。
 戴夫和我会见了建筑师。
 嗯，我想我们只是在等待获得许可来查看并制作该项目的 RFP。
 是，我知道这是一个，嗯，
 梅福德高中项目对于改善浴室的许多人来说都是很亲近的。
 我们想要它，我知道。
 市长让我们看看我们能生产多少。
 我想如果我们能得到一个价格，我们就会知道我们在哪里，然后我们就可以从那里走得尽可能远。
 我们仍在等待主入口修复工程。
 看看我们要做什么。
 我们的一个在清洁办公室工作的人是一名瓦工，所以他主动提出出去尝试修复一点墙壁，花岗岩墙。
 所以今天他在那里工作。
 我的意思是，我希望我能让它看起来更好一点，但它仍然会
 什么，是什么，所以你知道我们当然可以在主入口见面，我想我们将在下周和小组委员会讨论并讨论我们希望如何推进这一点。
 这就是为什么我每年都会在预算范围内订购一辆带犁的卡车。
 所以这并没有改变。
 这肯定会对降雪有所帮助，也肯定会对整个地区的其他杂项项目有所帮助。
 如果我们有一辆带犁的卡车。
 所以，你知道，我可以多次帮助 DPW，因为他们行动非常迅速。
 而且，你知道，有时有些区域需要修补，但他们无法返回，因为主要目标是城市周围的道路。
 因此，拥有这样的东西肯定会有助于提高效率。
 由我们处置，接机。
 现在，我想，现在的剧院正在翻修，如果你看到我的预算前报告的话。
 如果我有一个希望看到成果的项目，那就是添加空调、栏杆、更新门以及在剧院进行一些电气工作。
 几年前我得到了一个价格，现在的价格不同了：在剧院的天花板上加装一台空调需要 10 万美元。
 我认为这对社区也有好处。
 也为学校创造收入，也许在某个时候将其添加到我们的资本改进清单中。
 但是，就像我说的，如果我可以选择我想做的高中项目，那将是我的主要项目之一，即改造项目。
 我们一直致力于学校的暖通空调改进项目。
 你知道，在某些时候，也许我们可以从 MSBA 获得帮助，也许我们可以添加空调以及梅福德高中目前没有空调的其他部分，这意味着科学实验室是建筑物中唯一有空调的真正部分。
 服务，你知道，除了我们到处都有的窗式空调。
 所以看不到底部。</p>

 Uh chúng tôi sẽ nhận được hầu hết chúng vào tuần tới vào ngày 26.
 Chúng tôi sẽ tổ chức các cuộc họp tiểu ban trên Zoom.
 Ờ, nhưng không chỉ, ừ,
 Mọi thắc mắc đều được chào đón, cảm ơn bạn.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=1823.649s">[David Murphy]</a>: Cảm ơn, John.
 Thị trưởng, tôi đề nghị chúng ta tiếp tục quá trình đệ trình và sau đó tôi, John, Tiến sĩ Edwards và những người khác sẽ sẵn lòng trả lời bất kỳ câu hỏi nào nếu điều đó hữu ích cho bạn.
 Điều này làm việc cho tôi.
 Được rồi, cảm ơn bạn.
 Vì vậy, khi chúng tôi chuyển sang phần còn lại của khu vực hành chính trung tâm, văn phòng giám đốc và văn phòng của tôi,
 Chúng tôi đã đề cập trước đó rằng có một số phòng ban trực thuộc những cơ quan này.
 Tòa nhà và khuôn viên chắc chắn là một trong những tòa nhà lớn nhất và nói thẳng ra là một trong những tòa nhà nổi bật nhất.
 Đó chắc chắn là lý do tại sao chúng tôi mời ông McLaughlin đến tối nay và thảo luận một số chi tiết.
 Và nhanh chóng chuyển sang điểm cuối cùng về ngân sách liên quan đến việc nâng cấp HVAC ở trường trung học.
 Thành thật mà nói, đây là một ví dụ tuyệt vời về sự khác biệt giữa bảo trì và vốn.
 Khi chúng tôi nâng cấp một số bộ lọc của trường học để cải thiện chất lượng không khí, chúng tôi phải chịu thêm chi phí cố định liên quan đến việc thay thế bộ lọc.
 Một phần của việc sử dụng các bộ lọc thuần túy là chúng tôi đã chuyển từ thay thế hệ thống hai năm một lần sang thay thế nó mỗi quý.
 Thành thật mà nói, đây không phải là một khoản chi phí đáng kể đối với khu học chánh mà là chi phí bảo trì.
 Không giống như nồi hơi,
 Hay một chiếc máy phát điện biến thế, một trong những linh kiện mà chắc chắn chúng ta không muốn chi tiêu hàng năm.
 Chúng tôi sẽ kết hợp điều này vào kế hoạch ngân sách và vốn của mình trong những năm tới.
 Vì vậy, xét về ngân sách của tổng giám đốc và ngân sách văn phòng tài chính và hoạt động, như tôi đã đề cập trước đây, một số trong số đó gắn liền với một số ưu tiên khác và một số thứ khác.
 Đầu tư chiến lược đã được đề xuất cho bạn.
 Đầu tiên, liên quan đến ngân sách của giám đốc học khu, tôi rất tiếc khi biết rằng trọng tâm của chúng tôi trong suốt quá trình phát triển ngân sách năm nay là đảm bảo chúng tôi xác định các cơ hội đào tạo và phát triển chuyên môn cho nhân viên của mình phù hợp với nhu cầu của học khu trong bối cảnh hậu COVID.
 Chà, 75.000 đô la, thực ra có lẽ ít hơn thế một chút vì nó sẽ được chia đều trong hai hoặc ba năm tính thuế.
 Vì vậy, nó sẽ nhỏ hơn một chút.
 Chúng tôi xác định các cơ hội phát triển nghề nghiệp chuyên sâu và nhạy cảm với môi trường mà khu vực sẽ tiếp tục hoạt động trong những năm tới.
 Vì vậy, chúng tôi có sự phát triển chuyên môn về mặt xã hội và cảm xúc cụ thể.
 và đào tạo về thành kiến ​​ngầm, sẽ bắt đầu có hiệu lực vào cuối năm tài chính 2021 và sau đó triển khai trong các năm tài chính tiếp theo, ban đầu dành cho nhân viên và người quản lý liên quan đến hồ sơ.
 Đây sẽ là chương trình bắt buộc vào cuối mùa hè năm 2021.
 Vậy Tiến sĩ Edward-Vincent hay Tiến sĩ Cushing có muốn nói thêm một chút về lợi ích của khóa đào tạo này và cách chúng ta nghĩ về nó.
 Điều này nhất quán với chiến lược tổng thể mà chúng tôi đã ủng hộ trong suốt quá trình này.
 Một điểm cuối cùng.
 Tôi hy vọng rằng hầu hết các chi phí này sẽ được tài trợ bởi một số nguồn tài trợ bên ngoài mà chúng tôi đã đề cập ở phần đầu bài trình bày.
 Vì vậy, Tiêu đề II cụ thể cũng có thể là một phần tài trợ của ESSER, nhưng Tiêu đề II sẽ được sử dụng cụ thể để trang trải các chi phí sẽ phát sinh trong năm tài chính 2021.
 bữa tiệc và sau đó là vào năm tài khóa 22.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=2055.034s">[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>: Vì vậy, tôi không chắc có bằng Tiến sĩ nào không. Tôi chỉ muốn nhấn mạnh giá trị và tầm quan trọng
 Phát triển chuyên môn chất lượng và hợp tác thực sự với Ph.D.
 Để giải quyết một số thay đổi lớn mà chúng tôi sẽ thực hiện trong năm tới, đặc biệt là trong lĩnh vực học tập cảm xúc xã hội.
 Một lĩnh vực mà hội đồng nhà trường chịu trách nhiệm là cách học khu xử lý các trường hợp đình chỉ học tập, thuộc các hành vi học tập cảm xúc xã hội, cùng những vấn đề khác.
 Vì vậy, đó chắc chắn là một ưu tiên quan trọng.
 Đối với chúng tôi, đây là một trong những lĩnh vực mục tiêu để phát triển nghề nghiệp.
 Ngoài ra, chúng tôi sẽ tiếp tục tìm kiếm sự hiểu biết và phát triển chuyên môn hơn nữa về thành kiến ​​tiềm ẩn và tác động của nó đối với cộng đồng trường học.
 Chúng tôi cũng sẽ phát triển chuyên môn nhiều hơn về các phương pháp thực hành tốt nhất với tư cách là người lãnh đạo giảng dạy và nhà giáo dục.
 Về hệ thống đánh giá nhà giáo dục nhằm nâng cao trách nhiệm giải trình trong tất cả các trường học của chúng ta.
 Đây là ba khối lớn.
 Khi giải quyết thành kiến ngầm, chúng tôi cũng đề cập đến năng lực văn hóa, công tác chống phân biệt chủng tộc, chống phân biệt chủng tộc,
 Vì vậy, tất cả những sáng kiến này đều quan trọng khi chúng tôi chuyển đổi học khu để đáp ứng nhu cầu của tất cả học sinh và cộng đồng rộng lớn hơn.
 Chúng tôi cũng sẽ tiếp tục tập trung vào nhận thức về người khuyết tật và một lần nữa tìm cách loại bỏ thành kiến.
 tồn tại ở đó.
 Vì vậy, tôi muốn nhấn mạnh rằng ngay cả khi chúng tôi nghĩ rằng các ưu tiên của chúng tôi, các ưu tiên của chúng tôi trong học khu là xoay quanh việc phát triển chuyên môn, thì phát triển chuyên môn vẫn rất quan trọng để có thể thay đổi tư duy và thực sự đưa ra những thông tin mới.
 Vì vậy tôi chỉ muốn làm nổi bật phần này.
 Cảm ơn</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=2199.759s">[David Murphy]</a>: Cảm ơn, cảnh sát trưởng.
 Tiến sĩ Cushing, ông có muốn bổ sung điều gì khác dựa trên sự tham gia của ông vào các dự án này không?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=2207.372s">[Peter Cushing]</a>: Vâng, người giám sát đã giải thích rất nhanh về vị trí mà chúng tôi muốn thăng tiến.
 Ngoài ra, những gì chúng tôi đang làm là vào cuối tháng 6, chúng tôi sẽ cung cấp một chương trình đào tạo về học tập thiên vị và cảm xúc xã hội trong lớp học, với 20 nhân viên mỗi buổi trên toàn học khu.
 Vâng, sau khi đào tạo, họ có thể được phân công vào huyện và phát triển chuyên môn trong huyện.
 Mô hình này sẽ cho phép chúng tôi thu được nhiều lợi nhuận đồng thời cho phép chúng tôi thực hiện phát triển chuyên môn trong suốt cả năm theo cách phù hợp nhất với nhu cầu của Medford.
 Chà, chúng ta sẽ có thể gắn kết với nhóm của mình tốt hơn.
 Cùng với các đồng nghiệp và lãnh đạo nhà trường, dù là hiệu trưởng, hiệu trưởng hay phó hiệu trưởng, họ sẽ được đào tạo và quay trở lại và có thể áp dụng sự phát triển chuyên môn đẳng cấp thế giới này cho chính mình.
 Tôi nghĩ đây là cơ hội tuyệt vời để Medford thực hiện bước tiếp theo và mang lại sự phát triển nghề nghiệp tốt hơn cho đội ngũ của chúng tôi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=2280.431s">[David Murphy]</a>: 谢谢你，博士。
 然后去财务和运营办公室。
 正如您所看到的，这里有一些不同点。
 我将重点关注三个方面，包括交通，我认为它有自己的幻灯片，而且确实如此，谢谢。
 但首先，前两个，这是在昨晚的演讲中提到的。
 我认为这是在英语学习部门确定的优先事项的背景下发生的。
 想要投资一个机会来发展我们的努力，主要是我们的家庭承诺和社区关系。
 我当时指出，我们没有确定 22 财年对 EL 部门的具体投资的部分原因是我们从该地区获得了一项投资，我们希望能够推动这一事业，我们将为此努力。
 与 EL 部门、卫生服务部门、特殊教育部门等密切合作。
 我认为，当我们考虑如何构建组织以及如何组织特定的工作组合时，作为一般规则，最佳实践是确定需求，确定正在满足的需求或由于其他变化变量而正在发展的需求，
 然后确定如何最好地开发适合组织结构的角色和组合，以促进这些目标。
 然而，有时会出现多种事件同时发生的情况，我们的领导人员具有可用的能力和不断出现且变得更加紧迫的需求。
 这种融合发生在整个学年。
 老实说，引起我们注意的方式之一是当我们需要将整个行政部门转移到学校担任代课教师时。
 当我们清楚地意识到这令人筋疲力尽且几乎不可能时，我们试图做出不同的修改，我们的课前和课后规划主任继续自愿承担这项工作，并继续与我们沟通，就像她一段时间以来所做的那样，她觉得
 他的投资组合中有空间容纳额外的责任和信心类型，以及我们作为经理和领导者所拥有的个人能力。
 事实上，我们能够度过本学年，但通过能够确定我们可以在父母和家庭参与领域改进和更好地工作的做法，
 我指望黛安·考德威尔（Diane Caldwell）的帮助，她是我们的前副总监，曾担任家长信息中心的高级主任。
 我要说的是，作为一个新来这个学区的人，我在第一周继承了家长信息中心作为我的投资组合的一部分，没有夫人。
 考德威尔，
 如果能够提供这种领导力、指导和机构知识，这将是更具挑战性的一年，不仅是在对 PIC 的监督方面，而且在我和其他高级管理人员负责的工作的几乎所有其他要素方面。
 但我们从一开始就知道，
 考德威尔担任家长信息中心的管理员并不是一个永久的解决方案，他试图在内部运作
 在我们的预算范围内，我们不一定打算为家长信息中心主任作为一个没有其他职责的单一职位提供资金。
 然后是夫人。
 Fidler 表达了承担额外责任的意愿和热情。
 我们认为家长信息中心与贫困学校和缺勤学校计划之间有着紧密的自然联系，以及额外的支持
 呃，我们需要的能力，嗯，我们需要在家庭关系、交通方面的能力。
 嗯，我们认为这适合作为一个合法的、全面的管理组合。
 因此，作为 22 财年预算的一部分，我们建议将这些办公室重组为一般家庭参与区域，其中包括对家长信息中心的监督、对课前和课后计划的持续监督。
 以及交通连接等服务。
 现在，坦率地说，所有这些角色组合在一起的原因之一是它们是学年的不同部分，需要更大程度的关注和细节。
 这就是为什么我说这是一种融合，因为它非常适合与已经具备机构知识的人一起创建一个完整的 12 个月的角色。
 并在过去为该地区做出了出色的工作。
 这就是为什么能够有效地做到这一点，同时也对如何更有效地推进学区围绕家庭和社区伙伴关系的目标充满信心，是制定该提案的一部分。
 所以这是一场戏。
 然后你会看到，正如昨晚也提到的，
 我们设立了赠款协调员职位。
 这本身是一个非预算的事情，它不一定会对运营预算和赠款产生影响，这个人基本上一直担任非官方赠款协调员一段时间，但从技术上讲，在行政助理的角色中，我们已经能够将该人调到财务和运营办公室，与米歇尔·金登和她的团队合作，以确保我们
 履行我们的所有义务并尽可能有效地从合规角度执行。
 这是不同的，我想强调这一点。
 这当然与我们目前没有的拨款写作角色不同，但我们正在探索其他方法来释放一些能力，让管理员有机会更好地培养外部合作伙伴关系和
 并寻找赠款机会，以便我们的赠款协调员能够帮助协调并尝试以这种方式释放额外的预算能力。
 在我们谈论交通之前，我想再说一遍，这是我们昨晚谈话的延续。
 在本学年中，我们继续与 Management Solution 和 Paquette 先生保持合作关系，Paquette 先生担任临时代理
 夫人之间的业务管理员
 帕特森和我。
 我们已准备好委托提交给学校委员会的报告。
 基本上，我要求对报告进行附录，因为该报告是在整个学年中准备的，并在某种程度上促进了预算制定过程。
 我问帕克特先生，根据我们仍然拥有的预付款，
 基本上，您可以填写一些补充内容，其中会考虑到我们所做的一些更改，夫人。
 Kimu 和我在过去的几个月里将这一点付诸实践。
 这就是为什么我预计在本财年结束之前将其提交给委员会。
 然后，帕克特先生，我们与塔夫茨大学的合作伙伴关系，一开始只是测试合作伙伴关系，后来发展为对话。
 在技​​术基础设施的背景下，我希望我们整个夏天都能非常有效地从中受益。
 但随后我们还将探讨在展望 2022 财年时我们应该保留或可能参考的其他外部知识。
 这是一个高层次的概述。
 我将结束交通，然后继续回答您的问题。
 如果您还记得当我们谈论 22 财年的预测时，我们的成本增加了约 51,000。
 我必须快速地说，这些是因为它们是在 5 月 6 日解决的。
 这些与我们与特殊教育相关的固定交通成本无关。
 这是我们的主要供应商东方巴士。
 学校委员会于 2020 年春季签订了一份为期三年的新合同。
 所以，我们正在完成其中的第一个。
 的三年合同。
 与合同一样，成本逐年增加。
 因此，我们预计该合同将增加约 51,000 美元，作为我们预计固定成本增加 210 万美元的一部分。
 4 月 26 日，当提出有关 MBTA 通行证的请求时，您已经看到了以下两个数字。
 这本质上是我们的一个选择
 确保委员会知道。
 然后还有一些问题，涉及额外黄色巴士的基本成本以及在高中提供额外东区巴士容量的可能性。
 我们估计约为 75,000 美元。
 我之所以说它是零到 75,000 美元，是因为在我们与供应商的对话中，他们有，
 我认为，并且我很欣赏这一点，我不知道是否所有提供商都会这样做，但他们建议，根据本学年之前该学区采用的半径，就初中和高中交通而言，有可能重新调整我们现有的一些能力，以提供至少一辆额外的巴士到高中。
 下周我们将与
 巴士提供商以及梅德福警察局，我们将在那里讨论一系列问题，既与安全有关，也与规划即将到来的夏季学年的路线和站点的开发有关。
 所以，坦率地说，我目前没有向委员会提出关于是否应该增加第二辆公共汽车的任何建议。
 我认为很明显我们可以做到这一点。
 所以我认为问题在于查看有关哪里的数据
 什么是高中生以及是否有需求。
 我要说的是，在我与中等教育管理部门的简短对话中，我们根本不清楚是否知道对此有明确的需求，但我认为我们要牢记这一点。
 但与此同时，如果为学生提供更方便的服务的成本在 0 到 75,000 美元之间，那么显然我们会考虑这一点。
 我认为从战略角度来看，我们需要牢记 MBTA 通行证显然有可能提供更多的准入机会。
 而且，你知道，你开始考虑学生工作、去城市的机会。
 城市还有其他类型的体验，例如 MBTA 通行证可以为学生提供的课堂和体验式学习体验。
 我们正在考虑所有这些选择。
 贯穿所有演示的一个共同点是，我们决心在 21-22 学年为学生建立有效的延长上课日和课外活动计划，利用 ESSER 资金确保我们在学生面临重大干扰后提供尽可能最大的恢复支持。
 因此，我感谢您抽出时间并在这方面给予我宽容。
 如果你喜欢我可以提供更多证词和证人的演示，我保证我也更喜欢它们。
 但这些是建筑物和土地、财务和运营办公室以及主管办公室的记录。
 此时，我将很乐意回答您的问题。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3062.978s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Cảm ơn các quý ông.
 Chúng tôi có các thành viên của Van to Close và sau đó là các thành viên của Rousseau.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3068.903s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: cảm ơn bạn
 Cuối cùng tôi sẽ đi đến phương tiện di chuyển bằng xe buýt của trường.
 Dave, bạn đã cho chúng tôi một số lựa chọn thú vị nhưng có sự chênh lệch lớn về giá.
 Tại thời điểm này, khi bạn tạo ngân sách này,
 Bạn là ai và bạn có giới thiệu chúng tôi không?
 Thôi nào, ý tôi là, làm thế nào để chúng ta đưa chi phí vào ngân sách?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3100.169s">[David Murphy]</a>: Vâng, tôi nghĩ quyết định đầu tiên, vâng, đầu tiên là liệu ủy ban có hài lòng với bán kính được thông qua năm ngoái so với bán kính một dặm cho tất cả các lớp ngoại trừ mẫu giáo hay không.
 Vì vậy nếu đây là điều mà ủy ban muốn giữ lại
 Vì vậy, về cơ bản người bán đang nói rằng sẽ có tình trạng dư thừa năng lực tại một trong các trường tiểu học.
 Vì vậy, hợp đồng xe buýt phía Đông hiện tại trị giá khoảng 1,4 triệu USD sẽ cung cấp cho chúng tôi thêm một chiếc xe buýt trường học mà tôi nghĩ chúng tôi nên cân nhắc sử dụng ở trường trung học để tăng sức chứa.
 Câu hỏi duy nhất của tôi là
 Nếu không, chúng ta có thể chuyển hướng nó sang các chương trình sau giờ học và những ngày học kéo dài mà không phải chịu thêm khoản chi phí tiềm năng là 100.000 USD.
 Hoặc ít nhất cũng có một cái giá phải trả.
 Vì vậy, tôi nghĩ quyết định đầu tiên là liệu hội đồng có hài lòng với bán kính một dặm hay không, điều mà các nhà cung cấp cho rằng sẽ không có tác động lớn đến lượng khách đi bộ.
 Về cơ bản đây là nơi chúng ta đang ở.
 Nếu đây là trường hợp
 Vì vậy, tôi nghĩ bước tiếp theo là xem xét dữ liệu liên quan đến nơi sinh sống của học sinh trung học và liệu có con đường ý nghĩa nào để hiểu học sinh đang ở đâu hay không.
 Một lần nữa, tôi nghĩ nhược điểm duy nhất của chương trình này là với sự chấp thuận của MBTA, họ không chỉ đưa bạn đến trường.
 Tôi nghĩ rằng, đặc biệt là đối với học sinh trung học của chúng ta, có rất nhiều cơ hội học tập trải nghiệm mà MBTA Transit có thể mang lại cho các em.
 Điều cuối cùng tôi muốn nói là nếu chúng ta gắn cơ hội của chương trình với việc mua lại nó thì mã thông báo MBTA sẽ trở thành một khoản đầu tư tốt hơn.
 Tôi nghĩ có thể mất một thời gian, có thể mùa hè là đủ, để các nhà lãnh đạo giảng dạy của chúng ta có thời gian phát triển những loại cơ hội này nhằm tối đa hóa tác động tiềm tàng của khoản đầu tư này.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3230.138s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Vì vậy, Dave, hãy quay lại một trong những điều bạn đã nói về bán kính một dặm.
 Tôi phải nói rằng, tôi không nhớ việc bỏ phiếu.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3239.024s">[David Murphy]</a>: Vì vậy... điều này xảy ra trước thời của tôi, nhưng tôi hiểu là khi kế hoạch mở cửa trở lại này được đưa ra trước ủy ban nhà trường như một loại kế hoạch lớn, nhiều mặt, thì việc phát sóng là một phần trong đó.
 Kết quả là các tuyến đường và điểm dừng đã được điều chỉnh.
 Tôi cũng nghĩ vậy, và tôi tình cờ biết được điều này,
 Đó là vì lượng hành khách năm nay giảm quá nhiều, thông thường bạn sẽ dỡ bỏ các điểm dừng xe buýt và nghe thấy một làn sóng phản hồi, nhưng điều đó đã không xảy ra trong năm nay.
 Cũng có thể lượng hành khách đã giảm đáng kể do dịch bệnh.
 Nếu điều này không được chuyển sang năm sau thì bạn có thể muốn xem xét điều này.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3280.253s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Vâng, tôi nghĩ việc số lượng hành khách của chúng tôi giảm đáng kể là điều hoàn toàn dễ hiểu.
 Tôi biết ở Medford có một số học sinh đi xe buýt vì lo ngại về an toàn giao thông và đường bộ nơi họ sống.
 Vậy số tự động nói là một dặm, à, số tự động chưa bao giờ là một dặm.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3307.655s">[David Murphy]</a>: Điều quan trọng là tôi xin lỗi vì điều đó,
 Nếu bạn cho rằng điều này là hiển nhiên thì sét chẳng liên quan gì đến việc bảo vệ an ninh.
 Trạm dừng xe buýt của bạn là một phần trong cuộc trò chuyện của chúng ta vào tuần tới.
 Vì vậy, không chỉ có đại diện của khu vực và người bán mà còn có cả Cảnh sát Thủ đô.
 Bởi vì khi chúng tôi xem xét và phân tích các tuyến đường và địa điểm, chúng tôi muốn đảm bảo rằng bất kỳ địa điểm nào gây lo ngại đều được các chuyên gia an toàn công cộng xem xét cẩn thận và
 Không nghi ngờ gì rằng các miễn trừ về an ninh được ưu tiên hơn bất kỳ chính sách nào khác liên quan đến việc phát sóng.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3344.167s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Vâng, bạn biết đấy, một số trong số đó được coi là có tính bảo mật hoặc nó đã tồn tại từ lâu và bất kỳ động thái nào loại bỏ nó chắc chắn sẽ gây ra sự gián đoạn.
 Nghe có vẻ rất lạc quan khi nghe bạn nói rằng chúng tôi sẽ có không gian và có thể sử dụng các xe buýt hiện có.
 Dave, điều đó nghe có vẻ khá lạc quan đối với tôi và nói chung tôi là người lạc quan, nhưng tôi chưa sẵn sàng để đánh đổi cả hai.
 Vâng, có 350 ở trên cùng, đó là một sự thay đổi lớn.
 Và có một số điều chắc chắn, tôi muốn nói, bởi vì có rất nhiều, thật khó để hiểu chính xác những gì chúng ta đang đưa vào ngân sách của mình.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3389.268s">[David Murphy]</a>: Vâng, đây đều là một điểm tốt.
 Để rõ ràng, những dữ liệu này trả lời các câu hỏi của ủy ban.
 Không, tôi không biết, và tôi chắc chắn không biết 350.000 người đó đến từ đâu.
 Vậy hãy nói sự thật.
 ĐƯỢC RỒI</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3403.415s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Đúng.
 Đồng thời, tôi biết ơn các đồng nghiệp đã nêu ra vấn đề này vì đây là một câu hỏi, một câu hỏi về công lý.
 Vì vậy tôi nghĩ rõ ràng là chúng ta sẽ có nhiều cuộc trò chuyện hơn về vấn đề đó.
 Xuất sắc.
 Tôi trao bản thân mình cho người khác.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3421.005s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Không có gì là Tây Memeansau, Krewas Kreaz, Gramham của McLaellin.</p>

 Cảm ơn đã giới thiệu.
 Tôi cảm ơn bạn.
 Tôi tự hỏi ở đâu và thứ lỗi cho tôi nếu chúng tôi đã đề cập đến vấn đề này, nhưng tôi không nghĩ chúng tôi có phương tiện di chuyển cho các môn thể thao và ban nhạc.
 Liệu điều này có còn xảy ra nữa không?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3448.128s">[David Murphy]</a>: Câu hỏi đặt ra là dữ liệu bạn đưa ra tối nay có bao gồm dữ liệu đó không?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3452.33s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: Wi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3453.891s">[David Murphy]</a>: Không, nhưng đó chỉ là vì anh ấy sống bằng tiền dành cho thể thao hoặc nghệ thuật.
 Các dòng này sau đó sẽ được khôi phục trong năm tính thuế của bạn.
 Một trong số đó không bao giờ bị giảm bớt nhưng sẽ được duy trì hoặc khôi phục theo số lượng trong năm tài chính 2020.
 Vì vậy, hãy đảm bảo rằng chúng ta có đủ phương tiện đi lại cho tất cả các hoạt động, sự kiện thể thao và những thứ tương tự.
 Đây là theo yêu cầu của trưởng phòng.
 Vì vậy, theo những gì tôi biết, không ai yêu cầu bất cứ điều gì cao hơn mức trước năm tài chính 21.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3487.681s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: Được rồi, cảm ơn bạn.
 Chỉ là, bạn biết đấy, có vẻ như việc nhớ lại mọi thứ trước đại dịch đôi khi rất khó khăn, nhưng bạn biết đấy, trí nhớ của tôi giống như, bạn biết đấy,
 Kinh phí vận chuyển của chúng tôi vẫn chưa được phân bổ công bằng cho các loại nhóm khác nhau, vì vậy tôi sẽ chỉ nói đơn giản thôi.
 Chúng tôi hào phóng tài trợ cho phương tiện đi lại liên quan đến thể thao đến mức các thành viên ban nhạc phải bán tất cả những gì họ sở hữu để có đủ tiền chi trả cho việc đi lại bằng xe buýt.
 Đây là ngân sách thứ tư của tôi.
 Bốn năm trước, tôi không phải là người duy nhất nói điều đó
 Chúng tôi cần thông tin chi tiết về số tiền mỗi học sinh chi tiêu cho các hoạt động ngoại khóa.
 Bởi vì tôi tin vào trực giác của mình nên tôi không có con để tập thể dục cùng.
 Tôi có con trong ban nhạc.
 Tôi không quan tâm đến việc đưa ra những tuyên bố sâu rộng hoặc đề xuất thay đổi chính sách mà không có bất kỳ dữ liệu nào.
 Nhưng cảm giác của tôi, khi nhìn thấy chiếc túi tập thể dục,
 Rõ ràng có một số khác biệt giữa huấn luyện và quản lý ban nhạc và các khoản thù lao khác trong hợp đồng của chúng tôi có thể phù hợp dựa trên số giờ đưa ra, nhưng tôi không có cách nào để biết.
 Vì vậy, tôi thực sự tự hỏi liệu chúng ta có ưu ái những đứa trẻ quyết định chơi thể thao và những đứa trẻ đã gánh gánh nặng cho gia đình để kiếm tiền đi lại hay không.
 Tôi chỉ lấy hai ví dụ này để so sánh với trẻ trong nhóm.
 Tôi chắc chắn có những người khác.
 Vì vậy, việc khôi phục rõ ràng là tốt hơn là không khôi phục, nhưng tôi không có cách nào để biết liệu điều này có thực sự công bằng hay không.
 Điều này rất quan trọng với tôi.
 Đây là ngân sách thứ tư có vấn đề này.
 Năm thứ tư tôi muốn nó, tôi nhận ra rằng bạn không có đủ ngân sách cho ba năm vừa qua.
 Vì vậy, bạn biết đấy, chúng ta chi bao nhiêu cho mỗi sinh viên?
 Ý tôi là, bao gồm cả tiền lương trong hợp đồng với giáo viên.
 Ý tôi là, tất cả số tiền chúng ta chi cho giáo dục, trái ngược với từ mẫu giáo đến lớp 8, chúng ta tiêu nó vào việc gì?
 Anh ấy đang đi đâu vậy?
 Điều đó có thực sự công bằng không?
 Ý tôi là, vì tôi biết thể thao rất quan trọng với rất nhiều người,
 Sự cấm đoán này rất quan trọng đối với nhiều người.
 Tôi thực sự nghĩ chúng ta phải đi đến tận cùng của vấn đề này.
 Tôi không nghĩ đó là chuyện chúng ta có thể giải quyết tối nay.
 Thật ngạc nhiên, tôi thực sự không biết liệu vấn đề này có được giải quyết hay không.
 Nhưng chắc chắn tôi nhận thấy rằng bạn không nằm trong ba ngân sách gần đây nhất.
 Đúng.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3661.661s">[David Murphy]</a>: Không, đó là một câu hỏi hay.
 Tôi nghĩ bạn đúng.
 Ý tôi là, đôi khi có những mức độ khác nhau của tình anh em.
 Tôi nghĩ hầu hết thời gian,
 Sự khác biệt này xảy ra giữa các khu vực do hệ thống hòa bình tồn tại xung quanh môn điền kinh.
 Tôi nghĩ đó là lý do tại sao bạn thường xuyên thấy sự khác biệt này, nhưng chúng đóng vai trò rất giống nhau trong việc trở thành một phần của chương trình giáo dục của chúng tôi, thu hút sinh viên và khiến họ đến đây một cách thẳng thắn và tất nhiên là vui vẻ và tận dụng tối đa nền giáo dục của mình.
 Vì vậy, tôi rất vui được điều tra vấn đề này và xem liệu có
 Có những lỗ hổng nào mà chúng ta có thể cần trợ giúp để khắc phục không?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3704.757s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: cảm ơn bạn
 Vì vậy, tôi nghĩ tôi sẽ hỏi một câu hỏi khác mà tôi thấy có một dự án liên quan đến phòng tắm.
 Một lần nữa, đây là năm thứ tư của tôi và năm thứ tư của các sinh viên cố gắng tìm ra cách cung cấp các sản phẩm kinh nguyệt cho sinh viên của chúng tôi.
 Thật xấu hổ.
 Tôi biết không phải tất cả mọi người trong cuộc họp này đều đồng ý, nhưng điều đó thật khó khăn.
 Dự án CCSR đang hoạt động trong bốn năm liên tiếp để đảm bảo rằng học sinh đang hành kinh không gặp khó khăn khi tiếp cận các sản phẩm này.
 Thật thú vị.
 Tôi chỉ muốn nói rõ rằng tôi không bỏ phiếu cho bất cứ ai
 Cải tạo phòng tắm nếu mỗi phòng tắm được cải tạo không có hộp phân phối sản phẩm kinh nguyệt miễn phí.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3762.382s">[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>: Tiến sĩ Edward Vincent?
 Ông Russo, tôi chỉ muốn nhận xét rằng khi ông đưa ra những dòng này, ông tin rằng khi học sinh sử dụng phòng tắm ở trường trung học và không được sử dụng các sản phẩm dành cho phụ nữ, chúng ta có cả một phòng y tế.
 Các sản phẩm dành cho phụ nữ được sử dụng trong phòng tắm, nhưng thật không may, đôi khi các sản phẩm dành cho nữ giới lại không được sử dụng đúng mục đích.
 Chúng được sử dụng, trang trí trong phòng tắm và cuối cùng được lắp đặt trên trần nhà.
 Điều này đã xảy ra nhiều lần.
 Đây là một phòng tắm được giám sát và kiểm soát.
 Vì vậy, chúng tôi đã đưa các bạn ra ngoài, các sinh viên CCSR, và tôi thực hiện điều này như một dự án, nhưng tôi muốn mọi người biết rằng các sản phẩm dành cho phụ nữ luôn có sẵn trong phòng y tế và sinh viên không bị từ chối tiếp cận.
 Chúng tôi có rất nhiều sản phẩm trong lĩnh vực y tế và tôi không phản đối việc cung cấp máy móc mà sinh viên có thể sử dụng, nhưng tôi chỉ muốn chỉ ra rằng khi chúng tôi cung cấp, họ không sử dụng chúng đúng mục đích đã định.
 Đây là một phần lý do khiến họ bị loại trong quá khứ.
 Vì vậy, tôi chỉ muốn nói rằng, chúng tôi không cố gắng nói chuyện với sinh viên hoặc nói với họ, bạn biết đấy, điều này không có sẵn.
 Tôi muốn mọi người biết rằng nó có sẵn và đặc biệt là các phòng y tế cấp 3, cấp 3 có đủ đồ dùng.
 Dịch vụ này có sẵn cho tất cả các cuộc hẹn chăm sóc.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3872.29s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: Vâng, tôi hiểu.
 Tôi sẽ không bao giờ khuyên bất cứ ai cố gắng phủ nhận những điều này.
 Tôi chỉ đề nghị chúng ta lấy bản đồ của trường và tưởng tượng một học sinh ở điểm xa nhất của phòng y tế.
 Ý tôi là, trong số các thành viên ủy ban của trường, tôi là người duy nhất ở đây
 Anh ấy không có kinh nghiệm như vậy.
 Tôi chỉ đang đưa ra giả định về tất cả các bạn, nhưng, bạn biết đấy, ngay cả tôi cũng không thể tưởng tượng được rằng họ ở xa trung tâm y tế trong tòa nhà lớn này và bạn nói rằng bạn biết nó ở đâu.
 Tôi đi ngang qua tòa nhà để xem nó như thế nào.
 Tôi đã nói, trước hết, đây không phải là một cuộc đi bộ hai phút.
 Ý tôi là, chúng ta đang nói về chuyện, tôi thậm chí còn không biết bây giờ là mấy giờ, nhưng tôi đoán,
 Những gì chúng ta coi là rào cản tiếp cận dường như rất, rất thấp hoặc rất cao, bất kỳ phép loại suy nào cũng đúng.
 Tôi, bạn biết đấy, có những khu vực khác đã làm điều này và tôi đã không làm điều đó, họ không phải là một vấn đề lớn trên trang nhất thế giới.
 Tôi biết, những gì tôi đọc về sức khỏe, không phải là Đạo luật Thanh thiếu niên Khỏe mạnh, tôi đã quên mất những gì luật thực sự yêu cầu ở trường năm ngoái,
 Nhưng có một tình huống ban đầu là khi bạn vừa lắp đặt và cung cấp miễn phí, chúng bị dính trên trần nhà và những đứa trẻ cần chúng có thể mang giỏ đầy về nhà.
 Nhưng giống như nhiều thứ, chúng có thể trở nên nhàm chán.
 Sau đó, khi học sinh cần, họ sẽ có mặt.
 Vì vậy, tôi không muốn đây là một dự án đơn giản.
 Tôi chỉ tin tưởng chắc chắn
 CCSR, tôi nghĩ đây là một dự án CCSR, nó đã xuất hiện trong hộp thư đến Facebook của tôi cách đây một tuần, tôi nghĩ đó là về việc học sinh làm việc này.
 Họ không làm điều đó bởi vì họ không có gì khác để làm.
 Vì vậy, tôi nghĩ rằng chúng tôi không lắng nghe học sinh của mình.
 Tôi đang xem trang CCSR 2016, một trong những dự án của năm nay.
 Tôi không biết khi nào chúng tôi có thể làm được điều đó, nhưng cảm ơn bạn.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4012.217s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Cảm ơn Nghị sĩ Crest, Nghị sĩ Graham, Nghị sĩ McLaughlin.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4015.74s">[Kathy Kreatz]</a>: Vâng, tôi chỉ muốn cảm ơn bạn.
 Trước hết, tôi chỉ có một câu hỏi về phương tiện đi lại, nhưng trước hết tôi muốn mọi người biết rằng đó là một bài thuyết trình tuyệt vời, ông McLaughlin, ông đã làm rất tốt và các nội dung trong chương trình nghị sự là gì.
 Vấn đề này sẽ nằm trong chương trình nghị sự của tuần tới và chúng ta sẽ thảo luận về nó tại cuộc họp tiểu ban vào tuần tới.
 Vì vậy, tôi có một câu hỏi khác về giao thông vận tải.
 Có điều gì đó xảy ra là do tôi đã mở bản tin vì tôi không nhớ trong bán kính một dặm.
 Vì vậy, tôi đã đọc một lời khuyên về phương tiện giao thông trong Thế vận hội Kobe 2021 và trong đó nói rằng tất cả các trường công lập sẽ không đón hoặc trả học sinh tại các trường màu vàng, bất kể địa chỉ thực tế của họ có nằm trong bán kính hai dặm tính từ trường hay không.
 Chúng tôi biết sự thay đổi này là một gánh nặng đáng kể và chúng tôi luôn cung cấp dịch vụ vận chuyển vượt quá mức được chỉ định.
 Vì vậy, tôi thậm chí không chắc chắn liệu tôi có thông tin chính xác hay không.
 Ông Murphy, tôi không có thông tin gì về tình huống mà ông đề cập.
 Tôi không nhớ có cuộc họp nào về việc đó.
 Vì vậy tôi chỉ muốn đề cập đến điều đó.
 tôi biết bà
 Van der Kloot đã nói về nó.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4092.141s">[David Murphy]</a>: Thưa ngài, tôi chỉ muốn làm rõ.
 Tôi nói điều này với tuyên bố từ chối trách nhiệm rằng điều này đã xảy ra trước khi tôi đến đây, nhưng tôi đã tham gia kể từ đó.
 Nếu có ai, đồng nghiệp của tôi muốn chia sẻ kỷ niệm của mình thì xin đừng.
 Nhưng như tôi đã giải thích, khi ủy ban được giao bán kính 2,0 dặm,
 Tôi biết đây là dành cho trường trung học.
 Một lần nữa, có một giới hạn về điều này, như tôi đã từng, tôi nghĩ ở trường tôi đã được dạy khoảng một dặm rưỡi, nhưng về cơ bản nó không được áp dụng.
 Ngoài ra, để giảm tổng lượng người đi lại bằng xe buýt, cần thông báo các nhà cung cấp áp dụng bán kính một dặm ở cấp chính và bán kính hai dặm ở cấp trung học.
 Này, đọc đi.
 Thành thật mà nói, lượng hành khách đi xe buýt đã giảm nhiều đến mức không rõ liệu các nhà cung cấp có cần thực thi bán kính một dặm hay không.
 Nhân tiện, tôi phải nói rằng, điều này cũng không áp dụng cho trường mẫu giáo.
 Vì vậy, các trường hợp ngoại lệ là miễn trừ an ninh cho trẻ mẫu giáo và học sinh khuyết tật, và phương tiện di chuyển trong kế hoạch giáo dục cá nhân, tất nhiên cũng không liên quan đến cuộc trò chuyện này.
 Nhưng bán kính một dặm và hai dặm, một cái dựa trên các hạn chế của COVID và cái còn lại là
 Thành thật mà nói, về cơ bản, đó là một hạn chế không được thực thi, điều này không hiếm trong cộng đồng, đặc biệt là khi có ghế trên xe buýt.
 Đây là những gì chúng tôi đang giải quyết trong mùa hè này, lập kế hoạch các tuyến đường và điểm dừng với các nhà cung cấp trong bán kính này.
 Nhà cung cấp cảnh báo rằng nếu làm như vậy, chúng tôi có thể sẽ có 18 xe buýt được cung cấp trong hợp đồng.
 Với sự chấp thuận năm ngoái, chúng ta có thể chỉ cần một đội xe buýt gồm 17 chiếc, sẽ giải phóng 18 chiếc xe buýt để cung cấp chiếc xe buýt trung học thứ hai.
 Vì vậy, tôi nghĩ, Tiến sĩ Cushing, tôi thấy bạn giơ tay.
 Nếu tôi mắc phải bất kỳ sai sót nào xin vui lòng sửa chữa cho tôi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4219.238s">[Peter Cushing]</a>: Bạn nói không có gì sai cả.
 Bạn nói rất chính xác.
 Tôi đoán nếu bạn có thể nói một trong những khía cạnh tích cực của đại dịch là nó thực sự củng cố mối quan hệ giữa các giám đốc,
 Tôi xin lỗi các quan chức thành phố và các bậc phụ huynh không được nêu tên, những người thực sự cam kết thiết lập các tuyến đường an toàn đến trường, giảm lượng khí thải nhiên liệu hóa thạch của chúng ta thông qua nhiều xe buýt dừng và đi hơn, đồng thời tạo ra các xe buýt trường học có thể đi bộ để cung cấp cho học sinh một cách an toàn để đến trường và về nhà.
 Và hãy xem xét những cách khác để đảm bảo chúng ta mang lại cho trẻ em cơ hội đến trường an toàn, nhưng cũng nhận ra rằng, mặc dù đây là một vấn đề do đại dịch gây ra, nhưng vẫn có những vấn đề khác liên quan đến nhiên liệu hóa thạch, giao thông, ùn tắc, v.v. mà tôi có thể nói rằng tất cả các hiệu trưởng trường tiểu học và trung học cơ sở của chúng ta đã nghĩ đến khi chúng ta đã có những cuộc trò chuyện này trong năm qua.
 Họ gặp gỡ mọi người và lần theo con đường đến trường.
 Chúng tôi thu được dữ liệu bản đồ GIS từ tất cả các địa điểm của sinh viên.
 Khi xảy ra đại dịch, chúng tôi đã phân tích rất kỹ lưỡng để thực sự xem xét tất cả những điều này, và sau đó chúng tôi xem xét cơ hội mà đại dịch có thể phải thay đổi thói quen và suy nghĩ.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4309.15s">[Kathy Kreatz]</a>: cảm ơn bạn
 cảm ơn bạn
 Tôi cũng có một câu hỏi về thông tin sức khỏe có thể cho năm học tới.
 Ông Murphy, tôi không chắc ông đã đến đây chưa, nhưng Patterson biết điều này.
 Bởi vì chúng tôi đã trở lại trường học trước Ngày lễ Lao động với MBTA nên có lo ngại rằng MBTA sẽ không được cung cấp cho học sinh trung học trong những ngày trước Ngày lễ Lao động.
 Vài ngày trước Ngày lễ Lao động, bọn trẻ quay lại trường học.
 Tôi, bạn biết đấy, chúng tôi nhận được tin nhắn từ những sinh viên đang đợi ở bến xe buýt và xe buýt không có ở đó.
 Họ đi bộ xong và đến trường muộn.
 Vì vậy hãy chuẩn bị cho năm học tiếp theo.
 Một chiếc xe buýt trường học màu vàng đã được bổ sung và trong vài ngày đầu tiên, nó sẽ chạy đến một số điểm dừng thường xuyên nhất để đón học sinh trung học.
 Tôi không nhớ tất cả các chi tiết nhưng tôi chỉ muốn cho bạn biết rằng đây là một vấn đề đang diễn ra.
 Hàng năm, vì chúng tôi bắt đầu trước Ngày lễ Lao động.
 Sau đó, sau Ngày lễ Lao động, xe buýt MBT sẽ chạy trong giờ học bình thường.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4398.254s">[David Murphy]</a>: phụ nữ
 Kreatz, tôi thực sự đánh giá cao nó.
 Đây không phải là điều tôi đã quen.
 Tôi sẽ tự học càng sớm càng tốt.
 Câu hỏi đầu tiên của tôi là chuyện gì đã xảy ra với chiếc xe buýt này sau Ngày lễ Lao động?
 Bởi vì nếu nó có sẵn trong tuần này, tôi sẽ hơi tò mò về việc làm thế nào hoặc tại sao nó lại có sẵn.
 Ý tôi muốn nói là,</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4416.775s">[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>: Đây là một thông lệ lâu đời ở Medford và Công ty Xe buýt Miền Đông biết điều này vì chúng tôi bắt đầu đi học sớm hơn nhiều khu học chánh lân cận, vì vậy họ làm như vậy và có thể điều chỉnh xe buýt của họ để giúp chúng tôi vượt qua ba ngày đầu tiên trước khi các khu học chánh khác bắt đầu đi học.
 Vì vậy, bạn có thể làm điều đó, đó là điều bạn đã quen và chúng tôi chắc chắn sẽ tiếp tục với các thành viên Kreatz.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4444.807s">[David Murphy]</a>: cảm ơn bạn
 Vâng, tôi nghĩ chúng tôi chắc chắn sẽ tiếp tục thực hiện điều này và trong cuộc họp với Xe buýt phía Đông, tôi nghĩ chúng tôi cũng sẽ nhấn mạnh vấn đề năng lực vì khi chúng tôi thảo luận về vấn đề này vào ngày 26 tháng 4, cảm giác mà tôi nghe được từ ủy ban là nếu có một cách hiệu quả về mặt chi phí để cung cấp thêm phương tiện vận chuyển bằng xe buýt màu vàng cho các trường trung học thì đó là điều chúng tôi nên xem xét.
 Vì vậy, một lần nữa, chúng tôi sẽ có rất nhiều cuộc trò chuyện và là một đối tác thực sự tốt.
 Rất phổ biến năm ngoái.
 Vì vậy tôi hy vọng chúng ta có thể tiếp tục trò chuyện với họ.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4480.762s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Cảm ơn</p>

 cảm ơn bạn
 Tôi thực sự đánh giá cao việc chú trọng phát triển chuyên môn trong ban giám sát và chắc chắn mô hình đào tạo huấn luyện viên có thể thực sự hiệu quả miễn là có kế hoạch phát triển bền vững đi kèm với các buổi đào tạo chứ không phải mô hình đào tạo huấn luyện viên.
 Giai đoạn khởi nghiệp thất bại vì bắt đầu bằng chương trình tàu hỏa, xe buýt quá tốn kém, vì vậy tôi chỉ muốn đảm bảo rằng chúng tôi có sẵn kế hoạch bền vững để thực sự tối đa hóa khoản đầu tư.
 Về vấn đề đi lại, tôi muốn có kiến ​​nghị yêu cầu ngân sách bao gồm hoặc giả định rằng từ năm học 21-22 sẽ không có thêm chi phí đi lại cho học sinh của chúng ta.
 Chính phủ sẽ đệ trình một kế hoạch toàn diện nhằm đưa ra các đề xuất giao thông cho khu vực này trước ngày 1 tháng 8.
 Lý do tôi thêm phần này vào cuối là vì
 Tôi đã nghe nhiều người nói rằng trẻ em đi xe buýt MBTA có nghĩa là chúng thường đến muộn và không đáng tin cậy, đồng thời các bậc phụ huynh đang tìm cách khác để đưa con đến trường vì họ cảm thấy không thể tin tưởng vào xe buýt MBTA.
 Hãy nghĩ rằng có những sinh viên khác phụ thuộc rất nhiều vào những chiếc thẻ xe buýt MBTA đó
 Cá nhân tôi chưa nghe nói có thể đi làm và đi xe buýt bằng nhiều cách khác nhau, nhưng tôi không muốn bỏ qua rằng có những thành viên trong cộng đồng đang rơi vào hoàn cảnh này.
 Vì vậy tôi mong rằng chúng ta sẽ giải quyết lại vấn đề giao thông và mong mọi người sẽ hợp tác với Công ty Xe buýt Miền Đông, sở cảnh sát và các cơ quan khác.
 Chúng tôi hy vọng cộng đồng có thể tìm ra cách tốt nhất để tiến về phía trước.
 Tiến sĩ Cushing, tôi cũng sẽ kể cho ông nghe, tôi nhớ cuộc trò chuyện về bán kính một hoặc hai dặm và những điều tương tự về việc không áp dụng bán kính ở cấp tiểu học.
 Khi ông Murphy nói về trường mẫu giáo là một ngoại lệ, tôi đoán là tôi đã bắt đầu nghĩ nếu áp dụng như vậy,
 Một nghìn so với hai nghìn hoặc đại loại như thế.
 Tuy nhiên, bạn vẫn phải đưa con mình đến một nơi mà trước đây bạn chưa từng đến.
 Làm thế nào để bạn chỉ phục vụ một cách thực tế hoặc chiến thuật cho học sinh mẫu giáo trong bán kính gần nhất?
 Vì vậy, tôi nghĩ rằng có rất nhiều cuộc thảo luận về giao thông vận tải cần được giải quyết.
 Nhưng tôi hy vọng ngân sách phản ánh rõ ràng rằng học sinh sẽ không gặp khó khăn khi đến trường vào năm tới.
 Bạn có muốn gọi điện hay tôi nên hỏi những câu hỏi khác?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4679.808s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Tôi chỉ muốn nó, bạn muốn nó, tôi chỉ không biết các quản trị viên sẽ đưa vào ngân sách những gì nếu họ không cung cấp cho chúng tôi kế hoạch này trước ngày 1 tháng 8.
 Vì vậy, tôi chỉ muốn đảm bảo rằng ban quản lý và nhóm tài chính nhận thức được điều đó.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4694.075s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Tôi nghĩ nhóm tài chính có thể tìm ra điều đó khi chúng tôi nhận được báo giá cuối cùng.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4699.617s">[David Murphy]</a>: Chà, tôi đoán điều duy nhất tôi muốn nói là, Merrick,
 Tôi hiểu kiến nghị này có nghĩa là chúng tôi không muốn bất kỳ học sinh nào phải phụ thuộc vào thẻ MBTA phải mua bằng tiền của họ để đến trường.
 Bây giờ tôi nghĩ có nhiều cách khác nhau để khám phá câu hỏi này.
 Tôi nghĩ cách tiết kiệm nhất là thêm một chiếc xe buýt màu vàng, ít nhất một chiếc xe buýt màu vàng khác.
 Như tôi đã nói, điều này có thể miễn phí.
 Về lý thuyết, điều này có thể trung lập về ngân sách.
 Tôi nghĩ xa hơn thế, có thể có nhiều hơn một chiếc xe buýt màu vàng, và sau đó có thể có bất kỳ chiếc xe buýt nào khác ngoại trừ một chiếc, điều này chắc chắn sẽ có tác động nào đó đến ngân sách.
 Và một vấn đề khác mà tôi nghĩ chúng ta phải giải quyết là sẽ có những sinh viên muốn có thẻ MBTA giảm giá.
 Tôi không chấp nhận kiến nghị đề nghị chúng tôi chấm dứt quan hệ đối tác với MBTA và ngừng cung cấp thẻ MBTA vì nếu bất kỳ sinh viên nào muốn mua thẻ vì bất kỳ lý do gì,
 Chúng tôi chắc chắn muốn học sinh của mình có thể nhận được thẻ giảm giá giống như học sinh ở các khu học chánh khác.
 Vì vậy, tôi nghĩ chúng ta sẽ tiếp tục chương trình này, nhưng tôi nghĩ về cơ bản chúng ta chỉ cần kiểm tra xem học sinh sử dụng thẻ ra sao như thế nào.
 Vì vậy, nếu họ dựa vào nó, chúng tôi cần phải trả tiền cho thẻ MBTA hoặc cung cấp cho học sinh các lựa chọn thay thế để đến trường.
 bây giờ tôi muốn
 Tất cả phụ thuộc vào số lượng vé chúng tôi bán và số lượng sinh viên mua chúng dựa vào chúng.
 Vậy xe buýt màu vàng là tuyến đường nào?
 Chắc chắn có nhiều tầng lớp trong vấn đề này, nhưng chắc chắn có hướng dẫn rõ ràng từ ủy ban.
 Nếu chúng tôi có bất kỳ vấn đề nào trong quá trình thực thi, dù từ góc độ ngân sách hay hậu cần, chúng tôi sẽ quay lại.
 Đối với tôi, có thể có một nhóm sinh viên
 Khi chúng tôi nói, được, bạn mua thẻ này vì bạn cần nó để đi học, vì bạn cần nó để đi làm, vì bạn chỉ muốn một thẻ MBTA giảm giá.
 Họ sẽ nói, nghe này anh bạn, tôi chỉ muốn một tấm vé thông hành.
 Đây là 30 đô la của tôi.
 Tôi sẽ lo lắng về việc đi học.
 Tại thời điểm này, tôi không nghĩ rằng chúng tôi vi phạm chính sách.
 Tôi nghĩ chúng tôi đã tìm thấy một sinh viên quyết định thi MBTA và đi học bất kể anh ấy có đến đúng giờ hay không.
 Một lần nữa, tôi nghĩ mục đích là rất, rất rõ ràng.
 Tôi nghĩ chúng tôi sẽ làm mọi thứ có thể để củng cố nó.
 Nếu chúng tôi thấy mình ở trong một tình huống đơn giản là không thể thực hiện được từ góc độ ngân sách hoặc đơn giản là từ góc độ thực hiện, chúng tôi sẽ phải duy trì đối thoại cởi mở với Ủy ban.
 Nhưng tôi chắc chắn hiểu ý định.
 Như tôi đã nói, chúng tôi sẽ cố gắng hết sức để làm điều đó.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4879.947s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Vậy bạn muốn giải pháp được diễn đạt như thế nào?
 Phó Graham và ông Murphy để chúng tôi biết chúng ta sẽ thấy gì vào ngày 1 tháng Sáu, không phải ngày 1 tháng Tám.
 Tôi nghĩ điều đó rất rõ ràng.
 Chà, bạn đã đề cập đến ngày 1 tháng 8, tôi chỉ muốn biết tôi đang hỗ trợ những gì, những gì sẽ có và khi nào.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4905.178s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Vì vậy, ngân sách sẽ bao gồm giả định rằng việc đi học không tốn kém gì.
 Cho đến lúc đó, các kế hoạch và chiến lược giao thông vận tải sửa đổi không phải là điều có thể thực hiện được một cách hợp lý.
 Đây là khoảng thời gian kéo dài cho đến ngày 1 tháng 8.
 Về chi tiết cụ thể, thẻ MBTA có miễn phí cho tất cả mọi người hay có chiến lược xe buýt màu vàng và đó là điều chúng tôi đang thay đổi?
 Trong bán kính từ một đến hai dặm, tất cả những điều này rõ ràng sẽ có tác động đến ngân sách, cũng như mọi thứ xảy ra trong khu học chánh sau khi ngân sách được phê duyệt.
 Nhưng ngân sách phải phản ánh khả năng chi phí cho phép chúng ta đến trường mà không yêu cầu học sinh đóng tiền.
 Hiểu chưa, ông Murphy?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4960.204s">[David Murphy]</a>: Vâng, ý tôi là, tôi nghĩ lý do phản đối duy nhất, và tôi không thực sự cố gắng nghiêm túc về vấn đề này, là tôi không nghĩ hiện tại chúng ta đang yêu cầu bất kỳ ai phải trả tiền để đi học.
 Trên thực tế, một số học sinh đi xe buýt MBTA và xe buýt màu vàng của trường chúng tôi về mặt lý thuyết không đủ chỗ nên các em phải lựa chọn dựa trên nơi ở, tình trạng gia đình hoặc các hoàn cảnh khác.
 Vì vậy, trên thực tế, họ trả tiền để đi học, nhưng không phải chính sách của học khu quy định rằng chúng tôi sẽ không cho phép bạn đi xe buýt MBTA trừ khi bạn đi xe buýt MBTA mà bạn trả tiền.
 Vì vậy, tôi nghĩ rằng chúng tôi muốn thu thập dữ liệu về số lượng sinh viên hiện tại và hy vọng cũng sẽ xem xét trong một khoảng thời gian và xem chúng tôi bán được bao nhiêu thẻ MBTA và cho rằng đó là giới hạn mà chúng tôi phải cung cấp.
 Vì vậy, tôi nghĩ chúng ta sẽ xem liệu có thể giảm điều đó từ góc độ chi phí hay không bằng cách tăng sức chứa của xe buýt màu vàng.
 Vì vậy, tôi nghĩ khi chúng tôi bán thẻ MBTA, bởi vì như chúng tôi đã thảo luận trước đây, chúng tôi không muốn ngăn cản sinh viên của mình nhận được thẻ giảm giá.
 Vì vậy tôi nghĩ chúng ta phải thu thập dữ liệu trên thẻ.
 Thẻ được sử dụng dựa trên sở thích hay được mua nhiều hơn dựa trên sở thích hoặc sự thiếu sở thích?
 Những cách khác để đi học.
 Vì vậy tôi nghĩ ý định rất rõ ràng.
 Như tôi đã nói, chúng tôi sẽ thực hiện tốt và chúng tôi chỉ phải quay lại khi gặp trở ngại về mặt hậu cần hoặc mọi việc bắt đầu dường như không thể thực hiện được.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5066.605s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Ủy viên Hội đồng McLaughlin, về kiến ​​nghị này.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5068.707s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: Về chuyển động này, cảm ơn bạn.
 Chỉ cần làm rõ,
 Từ góc độ, tôi đoán tôi chỉ đang cố gắng làm rõ liệu có chuyện như vậy không, nhưng vấn đề tồn tại lâu dài là chúng ta có những sinh viên phải đóng học phí, nhiều người trong số họ gặp khó khăn về kinh tế,
 Có lẽ trong bán kính hai dặm, hoặc ít nhất trong bán kính hai dặm.
 Nếu bạn nghĩ về giới hạn của bán kính hai dặm, chẳng hạn, học sinh ở khu McGlynn, gần trường trung học McGlynn, đi bộ đến trường vì họ không đủ khả năng chi trả hoặc phải lựa chọn, bạn biết đấy, trả 30 đô la một tháng để được giảm giá, điều đó có thể ảnh hưởng lớn đến gia đình họ.
 Tôi nghĩ nó công bằng
 Giá trị đạo đức là một tuyên bố, và ngân sách của chúng tôi phản ánh các giá trị của chúng tôi, và tôi đoán tôi rất ngạc nhiên khi thấy trong lịch sử, ngay cả hội đồng nhà trường cũng ngồi ở phía bên kia bục giảng, học sinh cũng phải trả tiền cho việc đó.
 Phương tiện đi lại của trường, đặc biệt vì đó là học sinh không thể làm điều đó và sau khi bạn nghĩ về tỷ lệ vắng mặt, tỷ lệ đói, bạn biết không, nó có rất nhiều, nó có rất nhiều tác động, vì vậy kiến nghị này tôi biết tôi thà thông qua MBTA, nhưng tôi sẽ để ủy ban tài chính làm việc này và cho chúng tôi một
 Bạn biết đấy, trong khi đánh giá điều này, chúng ta có thể tìm hiểu thêm về phân tích chi phí-lợi ích trong cuộc họp tiếp theo hoặc cuộc họp cuối cùng.
 Nhưng tôi muốn đặt vấn đề này sang một bên và tôi ủng hộ đề nghị của ông Graham.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5169.127s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Đã đánh giá vào ngày 1 tháng 6.

 Đúng, có kiến ​​nghị nên có bán kính 3km cho các trường THCS vì theo chính sách hiện hành, dù bỏ dải vàng thì những học sinh này cũng không lấy dải vàng.
 Nhưng tôi, tôi không biết, tôi không biết thẻ MBTA có tác dụng gì, nhưng nếu một học sinh sống trong vòng bốn dặm quanh trường, chúng tôi vẫn sẽ đảm bảo rằng học sinh đó có phương tiện đi lại miễn phí, ngay cả khi

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5273.365s">[David Murphy]</a>: Nếu bạn ở cách trường hơn 2 dặm và nằm ngoài bán kính trường học, bạn biết đấy, ai đó bắt đầu nhận được xe buýt màu vàng miễn phí và người khác được thông báo rằng họ phải trả 30 đô la một tháng cho thẻ MBTA.
 Điều này thật quá đáng.</p>

 Đây là những gì chúng ta có thể quan sát được.
 Luật rõ ràng là không ai trên 6 tuổi được phép đi phương tiện giao thông.

 Nó có ý nghĩa và chúng ta có thể làm được.

 Tôi nghĩ vấn đề cụ thể của tôi là những sinh viên có hoàn cảnh khó khăn về tài chính phải trả
 Vận chuyển đến trường.
 Vì vậy, cho dù đó là trong bán kính hai dặm hay bán kính hai dặm hay bán kính một dặm hay bất cứ thứ gì chúng tôi cung cấp.
 Tôi biết trước đây các giáo viên sẽ trả tiền để đưa học sinh của họ vào MBTA.
 Vé quá cảnh.
 Vì vậy, ông Murphy, theo quan điểm của ông, điều này có thể cần được xem xét thêm, không nhất thiết phải dựa trên kiến nghị hoặc bổ sung cụ thể, ông biết đấy, kiến nghị đã được thông qua, nhưng theo quan điểm của ông, điều này cho phép thẻ MBTA được phép đi vào thành phố, chúng có thể được phép vào các lớp học trong thành phố, chúng có thể được phép có cơ hội việc làm,
 Có thể cho phép vận chuyển đến trường.
 Tiểu mục quan trọng nhất khiến tôi quan tâm: Bạn có đang đặt câu hỏi không?
 Đúng.
 Về vấn đề này, chúng ta có tập trung vào những người thiệt thòi về kinh tế không?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5405.854s">[David Murphy]</a>: Ồ, tôi nghĩ kiến ​​nghị này... tôi nghĩ nó dành cho tất cả mọi người.
 Vâng, tôi nghĩ đó là trường hợp.
 Đúng, nó rộng hơn những hoàn cảnh khó khăn về kinh tế, nhưng nó không bao gồm những học sinh trong bán kính hai dặm.
 Điều này cung cấp cho chúng tôi một điểm dữ liệu tương tự như những gì Tiến sĩ Grisham đã nói trước đó về việc sử dụng GPS để xác định ở góc độ dữ liệu đồ họa, bạn biết đấy, nơi chúng tôi có thể nói, được rồi, đây là số lượng học sinh của chúng tôi và chúng tôi cần đảm bảo rằng chúng được đến trường miễn phí.
 Giống như chúng tôi đã làm trước Ngày lễ Lao động, chỉ cần đặt một chiếc xe buýt trong hành lang, chúng tôi có thể chứa được hầu hết học sinh.
 Nếu chúng ta có thể làm được điều đó, tôi nghĩ đó có thể là một hướng dẫn rất dễ thực hiện.
 Nếu chúng ta nhìn vào đó và nói, được thôi, chiếc xe buýt mà chúng ta sử dụng trước Ngày lễ Lao động chỉ phục vụ 15% học sinh của chúng ta.
 Để phục vụ các khu vực khác nhau của cộng đồng, chúng tôi cần sáu chiếc xe buýt mới.
 Vì vậy, có thể chúng ta sẽ quay lại và nói rằng chúng ta cần xây dựng lại theo cách khác vì hiện tại chúng ta không có cách nào bền vững để làm điều đó.
 Vì vậy, tại thời điểm này, chúng tôi có thể phải thu hẹp đối tượng mà chúng tôi nhắm đến là những người gặp khó khăn về kinh tế như bà McLaughlin đã nói.
 Một lần nữa, tôi không biết chính xác kết quả sẽ ra sao, nhưng tôi nghĩ chúng tôi có định hướng rõ ràng và chúng tôi rất vui mừng được tiến về phía trước.</p>

 Tôi hơi ngạc nhiên khi thấy không có sự thay đổi công việc hay đề xuất nào ở bộ phận tài chính vì tôi có cảm giác
 Văn phòng vẫn còn quá nhiều việc phải làm so với số lượng nhân viên trong văn phòng.
 Đây là cái gì?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5519.74s">[David Murphy]</a>: Tôi nói, đây cũng là ấn tượng của tôi, nhưng không phải ở đây.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5523.442s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Điều này đúng, nhưng chúng tôi không yêu cầu giải pháp cho vấn đề này ở đây.
 tại sao vậy?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5527.325s">[David Murphy]</a>: Bởi vì trong ủy ban, bạn sẽ nhớ, những gì họ ủng hộ cho năm tài chính 2021 về cơ bản là sức chứa hai chỗ ngồi.
 Điều chúng tôi cố gắng làm trước hết là trong bài tập của chương 70, chúng tôi đã thêm vị trí của bộ điều khiển.
 Đó là thưa bà.
 Kingdon đóng một vai trò quan trọng trong việc khiến anh ấy trông bớt ngu ngốc hơn mỗi tuần so với thường lệ.
 Anh ấy cũng mang đến những kỹ năng và kinh nghiệm kế toán mà trường luật không có, điều mà tôi rất biết ơn.
 Ngoài ra,
 Chúng tôi đã tái định vị vị trí Trợ lý Hành chính đã phát triển thành vai trò Điều phối viên Tài trợ và tái định vị vị trí này trong Văn phòng Tài chính với tư cách là Điều phối viên Tài trợ.
 Đó là lý do tại sao chúng tôi đã mở rộng năng lực sản xuất của mình đến mức hiện tại.
 Bạn sẽ tìm thấy, ừm, trên thang lương của bạn, trợ lý hành chính, người thay thế cho vị trí trợ lý hành chính, tôi xin lỗi, để tóm tắt,
 Tất cả điều này kết thúc vào năm tài chính 2021.
 Tính trung lập về ngân sách của ngân sách của Điều phối viên Tài trợ đã được đảm bảo một lần nữa thông qua khoản trợ cấp theo Chương 70 vào tháng 8.
 Điều này làm tăng khả năng của chúng tôi và cho phép chúng tôi phục vụ khu vực tốt hơn.
 Ưu tiên duy nhất còn lại trong ngân sách tài chính và hoạt động là mức lương.
 Trước khi làm việc này bạn nên nói chuyện với mọi người trong toàn huyện, chỉ cần nói rõ thang lương toàn huyện là bao nhiêu, vị trí trợ lý hành chính hiện đang hỗ trợ 2 phó giám đốc, khi có người sẽ hỗ trợ cả 3 phó giám đốc, như vậy sẽ nâng cao năng lực của phòng tài chính khu vực này.
 Vì vậy, trên thực tế, chúng ta sẽ có,
 Một lần nữa, chúng tôi không có ý định tăng quy mô bộ phận tài chính của mình.
 Bạn đã nghe tôi nói tối qua rằng các ưu tiên ngân sách được phát triển theo Ngân sách 22 được thúc đẩy bởi những gì hỗ trợ trực tiếp nhất cho sinh viên.
 Tôi chắc chắn có thể hiểu rằng những người làm việc trong cộng đồng trường học sẽ cảm thấy rằng các văn phòng tài chính và điều hành không nhất thiết phải gần gũi hơn với trẻ em.
 Nhưng để phục vụ khu vực tốt hơn và mang lại lợi ích cho trẻ em, chúng ta cần có đội ngũ nhân viên giỏi.
 Bằng cách bổ sung vị trí Điều phối viên tài trợ, vị trí Giám đốc tài chính và một số vị trí Trợ lý hành chính, chúng tôi tin rằng chúng tôi sẽ có khả năng thực hiện việc này tốt hơn.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5687.179s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: cảm ơn bạn
 Sau đó bình luận cuối cùng của tôi chỉ là nói rằng tôi không chấp nhận việc tiêu tiền
 Nguồn vốn tài trợ cho các phòng vệ sinh, nhà hát Karen hoặc các dự án trùng tu sẽ được cấp cho đến khi có một quy hoạch tổng thể thực sự đáp ứng được nhu cầu dài hạn của trường trung học.
 Đó là rất nhiều tiền.
 Tổng số tiền là khoảng một phần tư triệu đô la, con số này không hề nhỏ khi chúng ta nói,
 Giống như 10 chuyên gia quyền lực, rất nhiều giáo viên, những người chúng tôi không thể nhập ngân sách.
 Ngoài việc chi tiêu mà không có kế hoạch xây dựng rõ ràng, còn có rất nhiều ưu tiên khác.
 Tôi đã nói điều này trước đây nhưng việc có một kế hoạch rõ ràng cho tòa nhà này là rất quan trọng.
 Cho đến lúc đó, tôi không thể ủng hộ việc chi tiêu quỹ cộng đồng theo cách trói buộc chúng tôi hoặc ràng buộc chúng tôi vào việc đáp ứng những nhu cầu lớn hơn của tòa nhà vẫn chưa được đánh giá.
 Cảm ơn</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5768.462s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Tại thời điểm này, nếu bạn có thể chỉ ra 800.000 đô la nữa trong các nồi hơi và phòng thí nghiệm khoa học và 100.000 đô la đó phải dành cho các dự án vốn.
 Vì vậy tôi nghĩ là có rất nhiều.
 Trường trung học cần rất nhiều sự tập trung và một ủy ban tầm nhìn, và công việc chúng tôi làm sẽ mất nhiều năm.
 Vì vậy, ý tôi là, tôi không đồng ý một cách tôn trọng.
 Tôi muốn nhấn mạnh điều này.
 Nghị sĩ McLaughlin.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5796.765s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: cảm ơn bạn
 Tôi có một số câu hỏi.
 Tôi nghĩ tôi sẽ bắt đầu với chủ đề này vì đây là chủ đề cuối cùng.
 Tôi đoán rằng tôi muốn chương trình nghị sự tiếp theo có sự tham gia của Ủy ban Tầm nhìn MHS để chúng tôi biết quan điểm của họ khi chúng tôi nghĩ đến việc tiêu tiền.
 Tôi chỉ không muốn lãng phí tiền tốt sau một khoản tiền tồi tệ.
 Đã có rất nhiều cuộc thảo luận về trường trung học và chúng tôi vẫn chưa có ủy ban tầm nhìn.
 Tôi hy vọng sẽ đưa vấn đề này vào chương trình nghị sự tiếp theo.
 Vì vậy, để quay lại chủ đề về giao thông vận tải, liệu Chủ tịch có hỏi ông Murphy muốn nói gì khi liên kết các cơ hội của chương trình với việc mua lại của ông không?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5840.763s">[David Murphy]</a>: Đây có phải là một trong những tài liệu?
 Nhận thêm thông tin cơ bản.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5847.308s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: Tôi không biết, tôi không hiểu bạn đang nói gì.
 Bạn đang nói về giao thông vận tải, và tôi rất tiếc phải trích dẫn bạn.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5854.951s">[David Murphy]</a>: Xin lỗi, tôi tưởng chúng ta đang nói về thẻ MBTA.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5857.612s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: Wi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5858.012s">[David Murphy]</a>: Những gì tôi đã nói, tôi nghĩ bạn cũng có nhận xét tương tự, thưa bà.
 McLaughlin cho biết thẻ MBTA là một khoản đầu tư tốt cho những học sinh đang đi học.
 Nếu có mối tương quan giữa việc mua thẻ MBTA thì đó là một khoản đầu tư tuyệt vời.
 Các chương trình và cơ hội giảng dạy thu hút sinh viên vào cộng đồng và mang lại cơ hội học tập trải nghiệm.
 Tôi không biết, chắc chắn có nhiều giáo viên mắc CCR, CCSR là một ví dụ điển hình, nhưng có rất nhiều cơ hội giảng dạy ở bậc trung học lan tỏa khắp cộng đồng và thế giới giáo dục nói chung, ngoài lớp học.
 Và nếu chúng ta muốn tăng đầu tư
 Và đầu tư vào MBTA Pass, vì vậy theo ý kiến ​​của tôi, nếu chúng tôi làm điều đó và suy nghĩ từ góc độ giảng dạy cũng như cố gắng mở rộng các cơ hội học tập trải nghiệm của mình, tôi nghĩ rằng bản thân điều đó ít nhất là một điều tốt, nhưng nó sẽ được khuếch đại khi chúng tôi cũng cung cấp những loại tài nguyên này để giúp sinh viên dễ tiếp cận hơn.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5931.149s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: cảm ơn bạn
 Tôi nghĩ đó chính là điều bạn muốn nói và bạn muốn làm rõ vì tôi tưởng tượng, chẳng hạn, các sinh viên chuyên nghiệp được đưa đến hiện trường, các tình nguyện viên CCSR và tất cả những thứ tương tự.
 Vì vậy, sẽ rất thú vị để xem cơ hội lập trình là gì khi chúng ta nghĩ đến việc phân tích chi phí của các lựa chọn khác nhau này.
 Vì vậy, tôi biết chúng tôi không chỉ có Xe buýt Phương Đông mà còn có các nhà cung cấp dịch vụ vận chuyển.
 Chúng tôi có một số nhà cung cấp dịch vụ vận chuyển và có một số vấn đề giữa họ.
 Về mặt cá nhân, chúng tôi đã gặp một số vấn đề với các nhà cung cấp dịch vụ vận tải của mình và tôi biết rất khó để giữ chân hoặc giữ chân nhân viên.
 Đặc biệt là trong tình hình hiện tại.
 Nhưng tôi đang tự hỏi liệu có một cơ hội tập trung, hay gần giống như giải pháp C-click, bạn biết đấy, một tùy chọn, hoặc, bạn biết đấy, một đường dây nóng để khiếu nại hay gì đó, nơi chúng tôi có thể thu thập dữ liệu từ cộng đồng về những gì thực sự đang diễn ra với hệ thống vận chuyển của chúng tôi, bởi vì chúng tôi đang trả rất nhiều tiền cho các nhà cung cấp, và tôi không cảm thấy các nhà cung cấp phải chịu trách nhiệm dưới bất kỳ hình thức nào.
 Những gì nhà cung cấp đưa ra không nhất quán, ngay cả trong một số giao dịch mà tôi đã thấy.
 Việc bố mẹ bạn về nhà với một lá thư nói rằng nếu bạn lỡ chuyến xe vào buổi sáng thì buổi chiều họ sẽ không đón bạn phải không?
 Bạn không thể làm điều đó.
 Nhưng đây là phương tiện di chuyển dành cho giáo dục đặc biệt.
 Nhưng đây là một bản đồ cụ thể mà chúng tôi đã thấy.
 Đó là điều tôi đang nói.
 Cần phải có sự nhất quán trong hợp đồng, ngân sách và chất lượng xử lý yêu cầu bồi thường.
 tại sao đúng vậy
 Một quản trị viên lắng nghe các khiếu nại về một bộ phận và một quản trị viên khác lắng nghe các khiếu nại về một bộ phận khác, sao cho người tập trung các khiếu nại này để chúng tôi với tư cách là ủy ban nhà trường hiểu được hạn ngạch của nhà cung cấp là gì và liệu chúng có hợp lý hay không.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6050.083s">[David Murphy]</a>: Không, tôi đánh giá cao việc cô nhắc đến điều đó, thưa cô.
 McLaughlin và tôi, như chúng tôi đã nói ở phần đầu bài thuyết trình, đây là một trong những lý do chính khiến chúng tôi muốn cơ cấu lại việc tuyển dụng một người chủ chốt tận tâm với gia đình.
 Điều này không có nghĩa là một khi chúng ta có Giám đốc Gắn kết Gia đình thì sẽ không bao giờ có khiếu nại hoặc sẽ không bao giờ có khiếu nại không nhận được phản hồi ngay lập tức, thực chất như chúng ta mong muốn, bởi vì bản chất của các tổ chức lớn là đôi khi có những điều xảy ra mà phải một thời gian sau chúng ta mới thực sự nhận được.
 Đôi khi chúng tôi nghe về nó, nhưng có tranh cãi
 Bạn biết đấy, đây là câu chuyện về những gì thực sự đã xảy ra.
 Vì vậy, tôi không muốn gợi ý rằng bằng cách tổ chức lại các văn phòng này theo một cách nào đó, các vấn đề bổ sung sẽ không bao giờ phát sinh, bởi vì, bạn biết đấy, đó là thực tế.
 Tuy nhiên, đồng thời, chúng tôi dự đoán rằng Văn phòng Gắn kết Gia đình sẽ đóng vai trò là người điều phối trung tâm về nhiều mặt giữa các văn phòng có liên hệ trực tiếp và thường xuyên hơn.
 Giao tiếp với gia đình, bao gồm một số chương trình chăm sóc trước và sau giờ học, quy trình đăng ký khi lần đầu tiên bước vào cộng đồng trường học, dịch vụ y tế (nơi việc giao tiếp với gia đình thường phụ thuộc vào cuộc sống) và tất nhiên là giáo dục đặc biệt, trong đó phương tiện đi lại chiếm một phần lớn vì chúng tôi giao tiếp với gia đình và phụ huynh trong môi trường giảng dạy,
 Có thể nói, một số vấn đề hậu cần vận hành cơ bản này là những vấn đề mà các gia đình dựa vào học khu nhiều hơn để giải quyết, và có những văn phòng này điều hành, tôi nghĩ sẽ hữu ích từ quan điểm giao tiếp và đảm bảo rằng những quản trị viên cần biết về một số vấn đề này sẽ được thông báo nhanh chóng.
 Vì vậy, Dân biểu McLaughlin, điều duy nhất tôi không đồng ý về nhận xét của bạn là,
 Khuyến cáo rằng không có nhà cung cấp nào chịu bất kỳ trách nhiệm pháp lý nào.
 Trách nhiệm pháp lý có thể xảy ra theo nhiều cách khác nhau và đôi khi qua nhiều mốc thời gian.
 Nhưng tôi sẽ nói rằng trong khi chính phủ và tất nhiên là bà Clinton.
 Văn phòng của Bowen đặc biệt nhận thức được những vấn đề này và chúng tôi xem xét chúng một cách nghiêm túc cũng như phản hồi chúng.
 Nếu phụ huynh hoặc người giám hộ biết rằng người chăm sóc không hoàn thành trách nhiệm của họ đối với học sinh hoặc gia đình trong học khu, chúng tôi muốn biết tình hình ngay lập tức.
 Chúng tôi chắc chắn cam kết luôn đáp trả bằng vũ lực vì tình huống mà bạn đang mô tả, bạn biết đấy, việc sơ tán là hoàn toàn không thể chấp nhận được và đó không phải là điều mà chúng tôi sẽ dung thứ.
 Cho nhóm của chúng tôi hoặc bất kỳ nhà cung cấp nào mà chúng tôi hợp tác.</p>

 Thị trưởng, hãy để tôi nói rõ, Trưởng khoa Dịch vụ Sinh viên rất nhiệt tình, nhưng tôi cũng hơi ồn ào.
 Tôi nghĩ về những người đã không làm điều đó và cách họ giải quyết nó cũng như cách họ chứng minh rằng vận tải đang hoạt động.
 Thành thật mà nói, tôi nghĩ nó liên quan đến việc thu thập dữ liệu.
 Ngoài ra còn có những chuyện như trẻ em đi học muộn.
 Nhưng một lần nữa, tôi nghĩ điều quan trọng là phải tập trung vào các nhà cung cấp của chúng ta.
 Cuối cùng, tôi muốn một lần nữa khen ngợi người giám sát vì đã hướng dẫn cô phát triển chuyên môn tốt hơn và phát triển chuyên môn có mục tiêu xung quanh thành kiến ​​ngầm và học tập cảm xúc xã hội.
 Tôi đã nghe được hai điểm về phát triển chuyên môn từ nhân viên và thành viên cộng đồng mà tôi muốn nhấn mạnh.
 một trong số đó là
 Tôi nghĩ rằng một số nhân viên chuyên nghiệp không nhất thiết phải cảm thấy rằng có một sự phát triển chuyên môn cụ thể, bạn biết đấy, giấy phép hoặc nhu cầu rất cụ thể, vì vậy tôi muốn đề cập đến điều đó.
 Bạn biết đấy, chỉ lo lắng về việc đảm bảo sự tham gia và phát triển nghề nghiệp của những người bán chuyên nghiệp, điều này rất quan trọng đối với những người bán chuyên nghiệp, có vẻ như phần học tập về cảm xúc xã hội chắc chắn sẽ là một phần trong đó, nhưng tôi muốn đảm bảo về điều đó, và tôi biết trong quá khứ, tôi nghĩ rất nhiều lần những người bán chuyên nghiệp đã đi đến nơi mà các giáo viên đã đi.
 Họ là những phó giáo sư. Theo như tôi biết thì bạn cũng biết điều đó.
 Nhưng tôi nghĩ cũng thật tuyệt khi có thể mang đến cho mọi người một số lựa chọn linh hoạt và phát triển nghề nghiệp.
 Vì vậy, đó không phải là điều tôi mong đợi câu trả lời cho tối nay, nhưng tôi chỉ muốn đề cập đến chúng để bạn biết.
 Cảm ơn</p>

 Tôi biết chúng ta đã thông qua nghị quyết về kế hoạch vận chuyển.
 Lớn lên, tôi phải đi bộ một dặm đến bến xe buýt mỗi ngày.
 Nếu lỡ xe buýt, tôi sẽ phải đi bộ 4 giờ 29 phút để đến trường.
 Có vẻ như nó lớn hơn Medford một chút.
 Vậy là 13 dặm.
 Nhưng điều tôi muốn nói là trải nghiệm của tôi về việc đi xe buýt hay không đi học,
 Ừm, nếu bạn nhìn vào sự vắng mặt của tôi ở, ừm, bạn biết đấy, Massachusetts, thành thật mà nói, có lẽ tôi sẽ có DCF ở nhà.
 Ừm, vì vậy tôi chỉ hy vọng rằng khi chúng ta lập kế hoạch, ừm, chúng ta đang nói về hai nghìn so với một nghìn, ừm, tôi nghĩ nó có liên quan một chút đến cấp độ nhân sự.
 Chà, tôi muốn gặp bọn trẻ trong bán kính hai dặm.
 Chúng đến muộn hoặc vắng mặt thường xuyên hơn những đứa trẻ ở ngoài bán kính hai dặm.
 Tôi thực sự không nghĩ bạn có đủ khả năng để trải qua một năm bán thời gian và một năm vắng mặt và tính toán khoảng cách đến trường và nếu họ đi xe buýt hoặc những thứ tương tự, điều đó có vẻ như rất nhiều công việc.
 Nhưng đây là một quyết định chính trị mà chúng tôi đưa ra mà không xem xét đến tác động của nó.
 Kết quả giáo dục, bởi vì, bạn biết đấy, nếu chúng ta luôn quay lại vấn đề này, nếu bạn không đến trường, chắc chắn bạn đang không học.
 Vì vậy, bạn biết đấy, trải nghiệm của riêng tôi khi đến bến xe buýt hoặc không đến trường, điều này chắc chắn cũng xảy ra ở Medford.
 Vì vậy, khi chúng ta đang nói về một nghìn so với hai nghìn, tôi nghĩ chúng ta cũng cần nhận ra rằng đó không chỉ là tác động tài chính.
 Ảnh hưởng đến tất cả các ghi chú.
 Người giám sát thực sự thích điểm MCAS của anh ấy, bạn biết đấy, chúng là thước đo, dù anh ấy có thích MCAS hay không thì chúng vẫn là thước đo và điều đó quan trọng.
 Nhưng đây là một chính sách cụ thể ảnh hưởng đến việc đo lường.
 Không, ý tôi là không, tôi không yêu cầu báo cáo, nhưng qua kinh nghiệm tôi biết điều này hoàn toàn đúng.
 Nếu bạn lỡ xe buýt, bạn sẽ không thể đến trường.
 Tất nhiên, nếu lỡ xe buýt và không có phương tiện di chuyển thì tôi không thể đi bộ đến trường, nhưng
 Tôi chắc rằng có nhiều trẻ em sẽ buồn bã nếu lỡ chuyến xe buýt.
 Nhưng không có xe buýt cho tất cả trẻ em trong bán kính hai dặm đó.
 Vì vậy, khi chúng ta gặp một trận mưa lớn, một cơn mưa lạnh khủng khiếp, điều mà chúng ta thường gặp trước khi hiện tượng nóng lên toàn cầu đẩy nhiệt độ lên trên 70, những ngày này, nếu bạn đi xe buýt,
 Không giống như việc bạn không đi xe buýt và phải đi bộ ít nhất 40 phút để đến trường.
 Vì vậy, tôi không có vấn đề gì.</p>

 Vâng, vậy liên quan đến kiến ​​nghị mà chúng tôi đã đưa ra tối nay, liệu ông Murphy sẽ cung cấp cho chúng tôi một báo cáo nêu rõ các chi phí khác nhau, chẳng hạn như chúng tôi sẽ sử dụng xe buýt màu vàng cho tất cả học sinh trong học khu hay chúng tôi sẽ xem xét việc mua thẻ MBTA cho tất cả học sinh?
 Đó có phải là một đề xuất có thể được phân tích tại thời điểm lập ngân sách để hiểu nó phù hợp với ngân sách như thế nào không?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6595.799s">[David Murphy]</a>: Tôi nghĩ chúng ta sẽ cố gắng có một kế hoạch không bao gồm những học sinh không ở trong bán kính hai dặm của một trường trung học phải mua thẻ MBTA.
 Làm thế nào chúng ta sẽ đạt được điều này, tôi nghĩ chúng ta sẽ mất một ít thời gian để tính toán, nhưng tôi chỉ nói, tôi không nên suy đoán về nó, mà tôi sẽ chỉ nói, trực giác của tôi mách bảo rằng đây phải là một kế hoạch nhiều mặt, rằng chúng ta sẽ tăng sức chứa của những chiếc xe buýt màu vàng.
 Chúng tôi có X số thẻ MBTA và khu học chánh đang chịu chi phí cho những thẻ đó và có thể khám phá
 Các hiệp hội khác giúp thanh toán chi phí tổng thể và xem xét những dữ liệu nào chúng tôi có thể thu thập để xác định cơ sở cho việc sinh viên mua MBTA.
 Vì vậy, tôi nghĩ rằng họ làm được, chúng ta phải xem xét từng đòn bẩy.
 Tôi nghĩ, theo những gì tôi hiểu, nếu chúng ta biết trước ngày 1 tháng 8
 Chúng tôi sẽ thông báo với ủy ban rằng đây không phải là điều chúng tôi có thể làm về mặt tài chính hoặc hậu cần.
 Tôi nghĩ tôi đã thông báo với ủy ban thay vì chỉ giơ tay và nói xin lỗi, chúng tôi không thể làm điều đó.
 Tôi nghĩ điều chúng tôi sẽ nói là, bạn biết đấy, trước chúng tôi
 Đây đều là những trở ngại cho việc giải phóng sinh viên mua vé với số lượng lớn.
 Vì vậy, tại thời điểm này, đối với Mme.
 McLaughlin, thì chúng ta có thể nghĩ cách nhắm tới những học sinh có hoàn cảnh khó khăn về kinh tế.
 Vì vậy, tôi nghĩ có một số thách thức, nhưng như tôi đã nói, phương hướng rất rõ ràng và chúng ta cần đi theo hướng đó và chúng ta sẽ làm bất cứ điều gì cần thiết để biến điều đó thành hiện thực.</p>

 Bây giờ chúng tôi cần thành lập một ủy ban vì tôi hiểu mối quan tâm của Jenny.

 Vì vậy tôi nghĩ có một
 Tôi nghĩ có một điểm trung gian giữa việc không làm gì và việc thực hiện một số cải tiến cần thiết để giữ cho tòa nhà luôn ở tình trạng tốt.
 Mẫu này là mẫu mà học sinh hiện đang sử dụng.
 Nhưng quan trọng nhất, chúng ta phải xác định thành phần của ủy ban tầm nhìn, những gì chúng ta yêu cầu và mốc thời gian mà chúng ta hình dung.

 tôi chỉ muốn
 Tôi muốn nói rằng tôi hết sức ủng hộ việc cải tạo một số phòng tắm trong khu phức hợp trường trung học vì chúng rất cần được cải tạo và cải tạo.
 Tôi đồng ý rằng chúng ta cần một kế hoạch toàn diện hơn, nhưng phòng tắm hiện đại nhất trong toàn bộ khu phức hợp nằm ở khu khoa học.
 Đây là dành cho toàn bộ khu phức hợp với phòng tắm thực sự hiện đại.
 Vì vậy, không phải tất cả học sinh đều ở trong khu vực này của tòa nhà.
 Vì vậy, tôi hy vọng rằng một số tiền đã được phân bổ vào năm 2019 và vì đại dịch cũng như tất cả những gì chúng ta thực sự cần sẽ được ứng trước để ít nhất là cải tạo và cải thiện một số cơ sở vật chất.
 Một số tiện nghi phòng tắm này.
 Tôi nghĩ điều đó rất quan trọng.
 Và, bạn biết đấy, tôi chỉ nghĩ về nhu cầu của học sinh và nói rằng tôi muốn họ có sẵn phòng tắm hiện đại.
 Vì vậy, tôi chỉ muốn nhắc nhở ủy ban rằng chúng tôi đã cam kết khi nhận được số tiền này.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6974.25s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Tôi chỉ muốn nói rằng tôi đồng ý với Nghị sĩ Van der Kloot.
 Điều này không có nghĩa là chúng tôi phản đối bất kỳ dự án nào trong số này, có thể chúng đều có ý nghĩa, nhưng việc thiếu thông tin hiện nay khiến chúng tôi có thể đưa ra các quyết định tiêu tốn nhiều tiền của thành phố một cách hấp tấp hoặc theo cách khiến mọi thứ trở nên phức tạp hơn.
 Khi chúng tôi thực sự thảo luận về nhu cầu xây dựng với các chuyên gia, chúng tôi sẽ làm những gì cần phải làm.
 Vì vậy, mọi người mà bạn nói chuyện đều có ý kiến ​​​​về những gì sẽ xảy ra ở Trường Trung học Medford và tôi đánh giá cao ý kiến ​​​​của mọi người, nhưng sẽ có thời gian và địa điểm để tham khảo ý kiến ​​​​của các chuyên gia và phác thảo.
 Các chuyên gia nghĩ rằng điều gì đó sẽ xảy ra với tòa nhà, nhưng cho đến nay vẫn chưa có gì xảy ra.
 Vì vậy, đối với tôi, bản thân tôi không phản đối bất kỳ chi phí nào trong số này, nhưng tôi phản đối giả định của chúng tôi rằng những chi phí này là thận trọng hoặc sử dụng tốt tiền của người nộp thuế mà không cần các chuyên gia cho chúng tôi biết.
 Trên thực tế, đó chính xác là những gì đã xảy ra.
 Vì vậy, tôi đồng ý rằng chúng ta phải tiến về phía trước và tôi nghĩ chúng ta phải làm như vậy với tinh thần cởi mở.
 Tôi nhớ rất rõ, ngay trước đại dịch, khi chúng tôi đi dạo quanh tòa nhà với ủy ban tầm nhìn hoặc ủy ban trường học, chúng tôi sẽ nghe các thành viên ủy ban nói.
 Khi họ nói chuyện và tranh cãi trong hành lang về những gì chúng tôi có thể và không thể coi là trường trung học vì cánh khoa học hoặc vì điều này hay điều kia.
 Tôi khuyến khích tất cả các bạn bày tỏ ý kiến ​​​​của bạn.
 Và thực sự phát triển một kế hoạch cho phép chúng tôi hiểu nhu cầu của tòa nhà để chúng tôi có thể tiến hành nhanh chóng và bắt đầu đạt được một số mục tiêu này.
 Điều cuối cùng tôi muốn nói là, mặc dù chúng tôi đã thảo luận về kế hoạch vốn nhưng chúng tôi lại không có kế hoạch vốn.
 Vì vậy, với số tiền 800.000 USD, tôi không cảm thấy thiếu các dự án, trong đó có một vài mái nhà phế liệu.
 Làm thế nào để đến đây nhanh chóng như vậy và kế hoạch vốn đầy đủ lại không tính đến điều này.
 Vì vậy, tôi nghĩ rằng chúng tôi còn rất nhiều việc phải làm trong kế hoạch vốn để có thể trở thành đối tác tốt với các thành phố khác và giúp đảm bảo rằng các nhu cầu của quận chúng tôi được đáp ứng và chúng tôi không rơi vào tình thế không thể duy trì được.
 Chúng ta đang ở trong một tình huống giống như đại dịch khác và chúng ta cần phải làm rất nhiều việc để đưa các tòa nhà trở lại tiêu chuẩn.
 Vì vậy, tôi thực sự ủng hộ việc chúng tôi ưu tiên chương trình vốn này.
 Tôi không phải là kỹ sư kết cấu.
 Tôi không nghĩ có ai trong ủy ban này giống nhau.
 Vì vậy, tôi hy vọng chúng ta ưu tiên trải nghiệm này khi nói về các chương trình tiêu tốn tiền của người đóng thuế và tôi không nghĩ chúng ta cần đợi vài năm để có được thông tin này.
 Tôi nghĩ điều rất quan trọng đối với học sinh là phải đến đó ngay bây giờ, và công bằng mà nói, với tất cả học sinh hiện đang theo học tại Trường Công lập Medford, giờ là lúc để tiếp tục thực hiện ưu tiên này.
 Con tôi không được tốt nghiệp ở một trường khác với trường hiện tại của chúng.
 Vì vậy, nếu chúng ta may mắn, học sinh lớp một và mẫu giáo có thể có cơ hội làm điều gì đó khác biệt, nhưng chỉ khi chúng ta hành động.
 Vì vậy, đó là chúng tôi.
 Cảm ơn</p>

 Tôi đã liên lạc với ông McLaughlin nhiều lần để có được ước tính và
 Chia sẻ thông tin này với ủy ban vào tuần tới.
 Vì vậy, nếu bạn quan tâm, tôi sẽ cho bạn biết rằng cuộc họp của tiểu ban sẽ được tổ chức vào buổi tối ngày 26 tháng 5 từ 5 đến 7 giờ.
 Có một số quy mô khác nhau trong chương trình nghị sự trước ngân sách chiều nay mà chúng ta sẽ thảo luận.
 Tôi chỉ muốn chia sẻ thông tin này.</p>
