Present.

38
00:02:44,775 --> 00:02:46,256
Seven present, none absent.

39
00:02:46,816 --> 00:02:47,697
And now I will turn it over.

40
00:02:47,737 --> 00:02:47,977
Thanks.

41
00:02:48,936 --> 00:02:49,376
Thank you.

42
00:02:50,037 --> 00:02:52,559
Good evening Mayor Lungo-Kern and members of the school committee.

43
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:57,502
Tonight is our fifth time gathering to discuss the budget.

44
00:02:57,522 --> 00:03:01,525
We're going to be focusing this evening on central office.

45
00:03:02,286 --> 00:03:06,729
Again, the office of the superintendent, operations, finance, safety,

46
00:03:07,694 --> 00:03:11,317
family engagement, human resources, and building and grounds.

47
00:03:11,998 --> 00:03:17,202
So without much further ado, I'm going to pass the baton on to Mr. Murphy.

48
00:03:17,222 --> 00:03:26,731
And I just want to thank him again and his team and Michelle Kingdon for all the work that they're doing during this budget process.

49
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:28,252
Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

50
00:03:28,272 --> 00:03:31,995
Thank you, Superintendent, Mayor, members of the school committee.

51
00:03:32,035 --> 00:03:33,997
It's a pleasure to be with you again this evening.

52
00:03:34,586 --> 00:03:39,207
for our fifth committee of the whole meeting focused on the FY22 budget.

53
00:03:40,167 --> 00:03:52,530
As the superintendent mentioned, tonight we'll be focused on elements of the central office, specifically the offices that are under both the superintendent and my own supervision.

54
00:03:54,391 --> 00:04:04,233
As we go through the beginning of the program, as we have each time, we'll be looking at the org chart and talking specifically about the offices whose budgets are

55
00:04:04,775 --> 00:04:10,618
are here in light of the fact that these are the offices that myself and the superintendent work most closely with.

56
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:12,520
While Dr. Kuching, Ms.

57
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,140
Galussi, Ms.

58
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:20,304
Bowen are here, with the exception of Director McLaughlin, we will be really the only presenters and speakers tonight.

59
00:04:21,085 --> 00:04:30,190
But certainly we'll be eager to answer any questions that you have, both with respect to the offices that we are focusing on tonight and anything else that we've covered

60
00:04:30,722 --> 00:04:32,883
over the course of the last several weeks.

61
00:04:33,744 --> 00:04:45,491
And as I mentioned in my message to the committee, both last night and a few minutes ago, we will be having a budget update on the school committee agenda this coming Monday, May 24th.

62
00:04:46,472 --> 00:04:53,016
And we'll certainly be picking up questions and comments at that point, incorporating and taking in your feedback.

63
00:04:53,757 --> 00:04:58,700
And that will go into the development of the recommendations that come before you.

64
00:04:59,177 --> 00:05:02,438
prior to your June 1st statutory hearing.

65
00:05:02,558 --> 00:05:27,303
So with that, I will start, as we always do, with the timeline for our budget process, beginning with the development of the district's strategic goals and priorities, leading to a series of, some administrators might say, seemingly endless administrative meetings internally, in which we vet various proposals and comments, questions, and suggestions

66
00:05:28,304 --> 00:05:39,594
principles and evening, but have not been following along for each of the various budget presentations, both at regular school committee meetings, budget subcommittee and the committee of the whole meetings.

67
00:05:40,034 --> 00:05:56,308
This is where we are right now leading up to that June 1st public hearing in which members of the community will be invited to speak either for or against, or a favorite for those who follow municipal presentations, those wishing to speak neither for nor against.

68
00:05:57,102 --> 00:05:58,524
the budget in part or in whole.

69
00:05:59,004 --> 00:06:06,231
And again, that will take place on June 1st, but there will be a budget update on Monday, an opportunity to comment and engage in further discussion.

70
00:06:07,772 --> 00:06:17,141
We've used the org chart in each of these presentations, just as by way of showing folks, perhaps outside of the Medford Public Schools community,

71
00:06:17,602 --> 00:06:21,244
which area of the organization we're focused on in this particular meeting.

72
00:06:21,324 --> 00:06:29,449
So this is the overall org chart showing all the various offices and departments reporting up to the superintendent.

73
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,031
And then these are the areas that we'll be discussing tonight.

74
00:06:33,051 --> 00:06:39,395
So you can see it's primarily the areas in my own portfolio, as well as those reporting directly to the superintendent.

75
00:06:39,855 --> 00:06:42,417
And you see the curvy arrow there on the right of the screen.

76
00:06:43,391 --> 00:06:55,179
which is indicating a reorganization of sorts that we'll be proposing as part of the FY22 budget, and that's something I'll be going into greater detail about shortly.

77
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:06,266
So as we've discussed in each of the budget presentations, the funding for the Metro Public Schools and the funding generally for school districts across Massachusetts comes from various sources.

78
00:07:07,227 --> 00:07:10,449
What we often refer to as the Chapter 70 allocation, which is the

79
00:07:11,183 --> 00:07:21,747
The state contribution under state law coming out of ed reform law of 1993 and the funding that each school community and district are entitled to.

80
00:07:21,767 --> 00:07:34,392
The local contribution, which is the revenue generated from at the local level that is air marked for the for the school department, which in Medford is a very sizable portion of that of the overall

81
00:07:34,932 --> 00:07:35,692
operating budget.

82
00:07:36,292 --> 00:07:48,476
And then the sort of extenuating circumstances under which we're currently operating mean we have a significant influx of federal funding coming in as a result of the COVID-related legislation that has come in.

83
00:07:48,976 --> 00:08:03,640
And that is coupled with the sort of standing external funds that come in on a year-in and year-out basis, particularly in the area of special education, which we discussed at length at the May 6th Committee of the Whole when we heard from the Office of Pupil Services.

84
00:08:05,649 --> 00:08:22,579
We've said that throughout the FY22 budget, we've asked those contributing to the development of this budget, meaning our department heads and our principals, to focus essentially on three primary buckets of areas in which we're asking them what are their budgetary priorities, what are their needs, what are their challenges.

85
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,720
First is personnel and staffing.

86
00:08:25,201 --> 00:08:30,464
And the committee certainly said before that when we're talking about school budgets, we're almost always talking about people.

87
00:08:31,271 --> 00:08:38,758
We're an organization made up of people, educating people, hoping to make them better people and people who are positioned to do well in their post-secondary lives.

88
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:47,665
But that is always going to be the largest chunk of our budget because, you know, as we say sometimes in school finance, we're not focused on widgets.

89
00:08:47,745 --> 00:08:52,930
We're focused on people in a community, and that's always going to be the largest chunk.

90
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:59,195
Materials and infrastructure, particularly under the challenging conditions under which we're operating, are always going to represent

91
00:08:59,635 --> 00:09:03,476
another, albeit smaller, aspect of the budget.

92
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:27,423
And training and professional development, which everything is, we are looking at everything through a post-COVID context, but for training and professional development, when we think about the ways in which some of the inequities, both within public education and society at large, have come into sharper relief as a result of the experience that we've all lived through, we are thinking very much in that context when we talk about

93
00:09:27,766 --> 00:09:34,409
what are our professional development and training priorities, and what is it that we're looking to invest in.

94
00:09:34,769 --> 00:09:55,298
And particularly when we're talking about the superintendent's priorities, while much of what we're planning will be supported by external funding, given that the budget development process is the opportunity to really look at the organization as a whole, see how we're structured, how we're organized, what it is that we're pursuing, what are our discrete challenges, what are our long-term overarching challenges,

95
00:09:55,862 --> 00:09:59,885
This really is an opportunity to sort of pull the veil back on all of the Medford Public Schools.

96
00:10:00,785 --> 00:10:23,319
And my hope would be that throughout these committee of the whole presentations, as we've heard from the various directors and school leaders, my hope would be that both for the school committee and the members of the community who are either watching this in real time or perhaps watching it subsequent to the presentations, you'll see the effort toward transparency that we have employed to try to demonstrate for the community exactly what it is that we're doing.

97
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:24,600
And I hope also

98
00:10:25,006 --> 00:10:26,867
the rationale behind these priorities.

99
00:10:27,268 --> 00:10:54,228
And this slide talks a little bit about that rationale in that these are the questions that were posed that led to the development of these priorities and that we're thinking about what are the targeted and intensive interventions that we can invest in to help reduce or eliminate the learning or opportunity gaps that have either been caused by or exacerbated by the disruption to instruction that our students have faced as a result of

100
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:56,187
the COVID-19 pandemic.

101
00:10:56,307 --> 00:11:06,650
And so there will come a time when our budgetary priorities and our goals are not informed fully by this experience and the disruption that our students have lived through.

102
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,810
At least I certainly hope that's the case.

103
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:17,852
One of the sort of constant refrains that we go back to is we're looking to make investments that will ensure our students' academic careers are not defined by this experience.

104
00:11:18,573 --> 00:11:23,814
And hopefully if we make these investments and we execute on them wisely, that will be the case.

105
00:11:23,854 --> 00:11:24,554
But for right now,

106
00:11:25,335 --> 00:11:42,410
coming out of these, as cliche as it might sound, these unprecedented circumstances, we are looking to see how do we use the funding that's available to us from the local, state, and federal levels to try to put them in the best position possible despite the chaos that we've all lived through.

107
00:11:43,971 --> 00:11:51,718
So on April 26th, we presented to the school committee the projections that we were looking at based on the preliminary information that we had.

108
00:11:52,367 --> 00:11:54,189
uh, leading into these budget presentations.

109
00:11:54,229 --> 00:12:01,255
And we've estimated that, uh, the necessary increase in the budget would be somewhere between 3.4 and $5.8 million.

110
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:16,008
Recognizing that there are a significant number of variables that are, uh, essentially not clear while variable one, there are restrictions on federal funding flowing in that are still not particularly clear.

111
00:12:16,028 --> 00:12:18,030
And I appreciate the mayor's comments to that effect.

112
00:12:18,795 --> 00:12:30,544
last night, but we're continuing to engage in a very constructive dialogue with our partners in the city government and reaching out to our partners at the state level and elsewhere to try to get clarity on that.

113
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:41,973
I think at this point we feel comfortable that the priorities we've developed that we think of as having a strong nexus to the disruption caused by COVID will be essentially eligible expenses.

114
00:12:43,314 --> 00:12:46,016
It's a question of, from an administrative perspective, exactly how

115
00:12:46,513 --> 00:12:51,577
we'll go about processing those and exactly how realistic is it to do that.

116
00:12:51,657 --> 00:13:04,966
So I think we feel good about the priorities that we've identified as our COVID-related or potential ESSER-related priorities, but there's still a lot of clarity that needs to come into view in the coming weeks.

117
00:13:05,967 --> 00:13:10,470
In addition to that, we know we have fixed costs as every district does on a year-on-year basis.

118
00:13:11,111 --> 00:13:13,933
These are costs that are related to contractual obligations or

119
00:13:14,688 --> 00:13:20,592
other situations that have essentially predated the development of this budget, but we know that they're going to lead to an increase in costs.

120
00:13:21,032 --> 00:13:29,798
Other variables also include the fact that we have upwards of nine collective bargaining agreements that are expiring either at the conclusion of this school year or the conclusion of the summer.

121
00:13:30,378 --> 00:13:35,221
And so that's certainly a factor that we have to take into account as we work through the development of this budget.

122
00:13:38,043 --> 00:13:44,287
This is just information related to those external funding, the numbers the committee has seen several times before, so I won't

123
00:13:44,915 --> 00:13:51,620
belabor it, but we estimate about a $7.6 million ESSER budget over the next several years.

124
00:13:52,161 --> 00:14:01,388
And so I wouldn't say that we necessarily see that as needing to be expended in equal installments over the three or four year period that we have.

125
00:14:02,448 --> 00:14:13,677
But I would say that we want to be mindful of the fact that we're going to have additional data that will hopefully point us to more strategic uses of the funding as time goes on.

126
00:14:14,115 --> 00:14:22,020
So it may be the case that some of the more immediate expenses are in the short term, but the better use of the funding could be in year two or year three.

127
00:14:22,381 --> 00:14:33,108
And for that reason, we are looking to be, I'm not sure I would use the word conservative, but certainly cautious and cognizant of the implications of using that funding.

128
00:14:33,408 --> 00:14:41,974
And the fact is, as you've heard me say several times, these are one-time funds and the ESSER funding will not last forever.

129
00:14:42,054 --> 00:14:43,655
And so we have to be mindful of the uses

130
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:53,836
being taking care to not create unnecessary structural deficits, and at the same time, making sure that we're being responsive to the urgent needs of students.

131
00:14:54,516 --> 00:15:00,040
And so where we strike that equilibrium is a big part of the conversations that we have been having and that we will be having.

132
00:15:01,141 --> 00:15:12,468
So I'm going to pause for one second before we move on to buildings and grounds and just talk a little bit about what you'll see over the next couple of slides in this, but I'm glad that I flashed to it quickly so that I can tell

133
00:15:13,673 --> 00:15:18,655
Mr. McLaughlin that he's on next as I continue to babble for another minute or so.

134
00:15:18,755 --> 00:15:29,639
But the departments that you're seeing starting with buildings, we're going to start with buildings and grounds and then move to the more umbrella offices of the superintendent's office and the office of finance and operations.

135
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:40,503
And if you think back to the organizational chart that we saw at the beginning of the presentation, you can see that for both myself and Dr. Edward Vincent, there are a lot of priorities and funding and strategic investments

136
00:15:40,866 --> 00:15:45,027
and proposals that cut across the different departments and offices that you've already heard from.

137
00:15:45,568 --> 00:15:57,712
And that's a good thing because what we don't want to do is present a budget to you in the form of 25 siloed or overly departmentalized mini organizations.

138
00:15:58,372 --> 00:16:02,053
We want common themes and common strategic priorities that cut across.

139
00:16:02,514 --> 00:16:09,616
And so what you'll see in the bullets that we've identified are pieces that are either reflective of those priorities

140
00:16:10,186 --> 00:16:20,095
or operational pieces that are meant to put us in a position that we'll be able to actually pursue those priorities and do so successfully.

141
00:16:20,795 --> 00:16:38,230
Similar to the information technology budget proposals that we discussed in last night's committee of the whole, a large portion, arguably all, frankly, of the buildings and grounds priorities, the year maintenance issue,

142
00:16:38,823 --> 00:16:40,404
uh, that is essentially routine.

143
00:16:40,464 --> 00:16:43,326
I think routine was the word that we used in the technology presentation.

144
00:16:43,766 --> 00:16:47,949
That's something that we typically are going to incorporate one way or another into our operating budget.

145
00:16:48,569 --> 00:16:56,013
Um, something that is a one-time expense and I'm using the term one time in the context of municipal budgeting.

146
00:16:56,073 --> 00:17:01,477
And so one time could mean every 10 years, every 15 years, every 20 years, but certainly not on an annual basis.

147
00:17:02,057 --> 00:17:05,219
Um, that's every 20 years, but certainly not on an annual basis.

148
00:17:06,173 --> 00:17:14,958
That's something that we're going to look up to as a capital expense that we're going to try to keep off the operating budget for purposes of not creating some of those deficits that we've talked about.

149
00:17:15,539 --> 00:17:35,530
What we do when we have a large influx of federal funding, frankly, similar to how we handled the funding that came in during FY21, and to some extent in FY20 as well, is to try to address some of the most urgent priorities and needs that might in another context be considered a capital expense.

150
00:17:35,987 --> 00:17:40,929
but in light of the urgency, we're looking to just take what funding is available and make sure that that's addressed.

151
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:58,898
That was certainly the case as is reflected in the buildings and grounds budget narrative that was provided to you today with regard to our HVAC repairs that we needed to expedite and accelerate at the beginning of this school year for purposes of getting students and staff back into the physical school buildings.

152
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:05,121
And so I expressed my appreciation for Mr. McLaughlin and members of his team who partnered with

153
00:18:05,609 --> 00:18:10,391
the external experts that we brought in to make that a reality.

154
00:18:11,292 --> 00:18:19,395
The history as to how we got to the place where so much work was necessary, I think, has been addressed at length in previous meetings.

155
00:18:19,495 --> 00:18:28,259
But however we got here, we are in a much better position from an air quality perspective because that work was done throughout the course of this year.

156
00:18:28,639 --> 00:18:34,242
And now we're looking at some of the other heavy infrastructure pieces that may not land in the operating budget for FY22.

157
00:18:35,303 --> 00:18:38,804
but are critical priorities that need to be addressed in the near term.

158
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:42,905
And I'm going to ask Mr. McLaughlin, if he could, to walk us through some of these.

159
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:57,468
As we're talking about how these investments need to be made in the coming year or months.

160
00:18:58,068 --> 00:19:04,430
So John, do you want to take it from there and just start maybe with the generator and transformer electrical issues that we have

161
00:19:04,885 --> 00:19:09,668
been identified at the high school and at the Andrews and then we'll walk through some of the other pieces.

162
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:17,193
From there we'll move on to finance operations in the superintendent's office and then we'll go to questions after that.

163
00:19:18,093 --> 00:19:18,434
Excellent.

164
00:19:18,754 --> 00:19:23,237
Good evening Mayor, Superintendent, members of the school committee and administrators.

165
00:19:24,457 --> 00:19:25,900
on tonight's meeting.

166
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:32,973
So first issue, transformer amps break is electrical projects at Meffitt High School, Andrews Middle School.

167
00:19:33,013 --> 00:19:36,479
So I think that we're aware of the fact that the emergency generator

168
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:41,636
One of the emergency generators at Meffitt High School needs to be replaced.

169
00:19:41,756 --> 00:19:43,857
We have discussed it.

170
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:54,059
We're on the road to getting an RFP and pricing information to try to get that project- Did audio drop out for anybody else?

171
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:55,400
No?

172
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,361
You guys can still hear?

173
00:19:58,941 --> 00:19:59,141
Yes.

174
00:19:59,161 --> 00:20:00,221
Sorry.

175
00:20:00,801 --> 00:20:04,522
I can hear, but when David was talking, it cut out for a little bit and then came back on.

176
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:06,263
Just for a second it did, yes.

177
00:20:07,575 --> 00:20:12,078
You've probably heard from me enough in the last week or two, sorry.

178
00:20:12,659 --> 00:20:13,419
I think we're good, John.

179
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:14,940
Okay, good.

180
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:20,945
So the Andrews School, that issue has already been squared away out of my regular budget.

181
00:20:20,985 --> 00:20:30,792
We did electrical infrared scans of all the buildings, and there was an issue with a breaker at the Andrews that we have.

182
00:20:31,817 --> 00:20:34,519
repaired, so that's good.

183
00:20:35,139 --> 00:20:36,881
We also have a transformer.

184
00:20:36,901 --> 00:20:38,302
I can't hear Mr. McLaughlin.

185
00:20:39,002 --> 00:20:39,122
Oh.

186
00:20:39,142 --> 00:20:41,644
I don't know.

187
00:20:41,684 --> 00:20:42,905
I'm able to hear him okay.

188
00:20:43,285 --> 00:20:43,745
Me too.

189
00:20:44,186 --> 00:20:44,886
I can hear him fine.

190
00:20:44,906 --> 00:20:45,546
I wonder what's up.

191
00:20:46,367 --> 00:20:51,110
Now I can, but I'll say Mayor, excuse me, Mayor, he dropped off for me for a good minute.

192
00:20:51,451 --> 00:20:52,091
Oh boy.

193
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,973
You want him to start over, Melanie?

194
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:56,254
Would you like me to start?

195
00:20:56,274 --> 00:20:57,054
Kathy, can you hear him now?

196
00:20:58,075 --> 00:21:00,617
Yeah, I lost, I couldn't hear you either, John.

197
00:21:02,233 --> 00:21:02,613
Okay.

198
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:03,433
I don't know.

199
00:21:04,394 --> 00:21:05,674
I got the hotspot going.

200
00:21:05,754 --> 00:21:08,014
I, I, you know, I've been preparing for this for a while.

201
00:21:08,034 --> 00:21:18,017
So anyway, so, uh, yeah, so the, uh, the breaker or the amp, uh, trans, uh, the breaker was replaced at the Andrews middle school.

202
00:21:18,057 --> 00:21:21,638
So we're, uh, we're back where we need to be.

203
00:21:21,938 --> 00:21:30,300
Um, it was part of a, uh, we had had, um, insurance, uh, inspection, infrared scan of all the electrical systems.

204
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:35,263
up at the high school, through law school, excuse me.

205
00:21:35,403 --> 00:21:39,666
And so we were able to take care of that off of my regular operations budget.

206
00:21:40,127 --> 00:21:48,333
So we do, we also, we know about the emergency generator, that's getting ready to go out for an RFP.

207
00:21:49,053 --> 00:21:56,158
Also the transformer, the transformer is an original equipment at Medford High School.

208
00:21:56,198 --> 00:21:58,280
So what happened was, is when,

209
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:02,312
years ago would have PCBs in it.

210
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:08,036
So we had to take out the PCBs and put another type of oil on it.

211
00:22:08,576 --> 00:22:15,561
And what ends up happening with that is the rubber seals tend to give way.

212
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:19,744
So I'm in the process of obtaining a quote.

213
00:22:20,304 --> 00:22:24,788
I have it, I just got it today to overhaul the transformer.

214
00:22:25,608 --> 00:22:31,153
And make sure that make sure we can get that back to where we need to be.

215
00:22:31,193 --> 00:22:41,442
It's a little bit low on oil it's still running, but it's, it's certainly something that has to take priority because it also functions as one third of the power.

216
00:22:42,163 --> 00:22:43,083
at Medford High School.

217
00:22:43,804 --> 00:22:48,466
So we'll have the pricing information ready to go on that.

218
00:22:48,526 --> 00:22:57,750
And that would be a summer project, obviously, with the generator, if and when we're ready to take that project on.

219
00:22:58,811 --> 00:23:00,952
This year, we had some security enhancements.

220
00:23:00,972 --> 00:23:02,292
We had a new Raptor system.

221
00:23:04,513 --> 00:23:09,636
put in all of the monitors at this point in time, I've had training on the new Raptor system.

222
00:23:10,116 --> 00:23:15,499
If you don't know the Raptor system is where you come in, you give you a license, they scan it.

223
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:25,304
If everything's okay, you get a tag, you're ready to go to the main office to conduct business that you need to conduct in any of our schools.

224
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:32,250
So every three or four years, we like to get the parking lot done.

225
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:35,913
Usually it's all of them, should I say, system-wide.

226
00:23:36,954 --> 00:23:39,637
Parking lots restriped, they're starting to get old.

227
00:23:40,818 --> 00:23:41,979
We did want to make some

228
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:48,781
adjustments at Mefford High School, which we'll be meeting about as far as a handicap parking situation goes.

229
00:23:48,841 --> 00:23:53,482
I know we've had that conversation when we were talking about the front entrance.

230
00:23:53,562 --> 00:24:05,424
And I think what we want to do is move to handicap spots to the front loop of Mefford High School and to access the handicap ramp that's right there.

231
00:24:05,924 --> 00:24:09,865
So that would be, you know, we'll overhaul it.

232
00:24:10,825 --> 00:24:11,565
I did talk to

233
00:24:12,933 --> 00:24:21,838
Mayor Lungo Kern last week, so if I need any help, we do have the traffic department down at City Hall, they'll be more than happy to help us.

234
00:24:21,899 --> 00:24:36,307
We did meet with them a couple of years ago to try to make some improvements, but as we all know, this past year hasn't been the typical year that we normally deal with.

235
00:24:36,988 --> 00:24:41,751
The Curtis Tufts Boiler Project, so last winter, the boiler started to leak.

236
00:24:43,151 --> 00:24:47,654
These are all things that we'll probably be bringing up next week in the subcommittee meeting.

237
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:54,357
So we ordered some pieces that have to be reinstalled, so sectionals.

238
00:24:54,797 --> 00:25:02,301
So we were able to obtain two sectionals that they're gonna replace, and that should stop the leaking, we hope.

239
00:25:02,941 --> 00:25:10,725
And that's gonna be, it's gonna be significant money that we have to spend on it.

240
00:25:11,545 --> 00:25:13,907
and HVAC enhancements.

241
00:25:14,227 --> 00:25:16,569
So we know that we've done a lot of that.

242
00:25:17,069 --> 00:25:20,271
At this point in time, we're getting air conditioning up and running.

243
00:25:20,732 --> 00:25:31,800
So there are associated problems with that, certain particular areas here and there that we need to bring in our contractor to fix them up.

244
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,583
This is by law, we have to offer heat till May 15th.

245
00:25:37,764 --> 00:25:40,266
So this would be the week that we do the turnover.

246
00:25:40,986 --> 00:25:48,171
Unfortunately, it's been hot this week, which, you know, it's a crapshoot, but it has been hot this week.

247
00:25:48,892 --> 00:25:56,277
So some of the teachers in classrooms have been a little bit uncomfortable, but we're working on it.

248
00:25:56,357 --> 00:25:57,218
We know you're there.

249
00:25:57,598 --> 00:26:03,663
We're going to get out there and take care of whatever we need to do as soon as we can, as soon as possible.

250
00:26:05,956 --> 00:26:07,096
calling in the contractor.

251
00:26:07,116 --> 00:26:14,038
I'm just trying to get one list of, of, um, what we need to have done and which buildings that need to be done.

252
00:26:15,218 --> 00:26:18,059
Um, the restroom rehabilitation project.

253
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:22,020
So with me and Dave, we have met with the architect.

254
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:31,162
Um, I believe that we were waiting just to get the go ahead and to see and do RFPs for that project.

255
00:26:31,422 --> 00:26:32,982
It was, I know that this is a, um,

256
00:26:34,205 --> 00:26:39,778
project of Mefford High School that's going to be near and dear to a lot of people upgrading the restrooms.

257
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,184
We do want to, I know that

258
00:26:43,804 --> 00:26:48,045
The mayor requested us to look into seeing how many that we can do.

259
00:26:48,625 --> 00:26:58,468
I believe that if we get a price on one, we'll know where we stand and then we can move forward as far as we can from there.

260
00:26:58,968 --> 00:27:04,669
The main entrance rehabilitation project, we're still kind of waiting.

261
00:27:05,229 --> 00:27:08,911
to see where we're going to go with that.

262
00:27:09,331 --> 00:27:20,816
One of our guys that works in the custodian department, he's a Mason, so he volunteered to go out and try to fix the wall, the granite wall up a little bit.

263
00:27:21,176 --> 00:27:22,777
So he's out there today working.

264
00:27:23,257 --> 00:27:28,840
I mean, hopefully he can make it look a little bit better, but it's still going to be

265
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:42,163
What, what it is, and then you know we can certainly meet on the main entrance and I think we'll talk and discuss it next week and subcommittee of how we want to move forward with that.

266
00:27:43,006 --> 00:27:48,512
And so every year, I think in my budget, I always ask for a pickup truck with a plow.

267
00:27:49,113 --> 00:27:50,374
So that hasn't changed.

268
00:27:50,474 --> 00:27:58,383
It would, it would certainly, um, it would certainly help in the snow would certainly help with other, uh, various projects around the district.

269
00:27:58,883 --> 00:28:05,030
If at some point we get a, uh, a, um, a pickup truck with a plow.

270
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:12,148
So that that way, you know, I can help the DPW a lot of times they're moving around very quickly.

271
00:28:12,168 --> 00:28:21,794
And, you know, there are sometimes the areas that need to be touched up that they can't get right back to because their main goal is the roads around town.

272
00:28:22,234 --> 00:28:27,497
So it would certainly help with the efficiency of having something like that.

273
00:28:28,518 --> 00:28:30,382
available to us, pick up truck.

274
00:28:31,083 --> 00:28:36,632
Now, the renovation of the current theater and if you see my, my pre budget report, I guess.

275
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:51,291
If I had a project that I would like to see happen, it would be adding air conditioning, railings, upgrading the doors, doing some electrical work in the theater.

276
00:28:51,871 --> 00:29:01,437
So a few years ago, I got a price and the prices are different now of $100,000 to add an AC unit to the roof in the theater.

277
00:29:01,877 --> 00:29:04,839
I think it would be beneficial to the community as well.

278
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:17,105
generating revenue as well for the school to maybe add that at some point, put that on our list of capital improvements.

279
00:29:18,145 --> 00:29:26,889
It's just, like I said, if I had my choice of the project that I would want to do with the high school, that would be one of my main projects, renovation projects.

280
00:29:27,511 --> 00:29:32,175
And then we're always working on HVAC enhancement projects at the high school.

281
00:29:33,416 --> 00:29:52,934
You know, at some point, you know, maybe we'll get some help from the MSBA, maybe be able to add, you know, air conditioning and to other parts of Mefford High School that don't have it right now, meaning the science lab is the only real part of the building that does have air conditioning,

282
00:29:54,233 --> 00:29:58,395
service, you know, except for window air conditioners that we have all around the place.

283
00:29:59,015 --> 00:30:00,776
So I can't see the bottom.

284
00:30:01,416 --> 00:30:02,557
I think we're at the bottom.

285
00:30:03,297 --> 00:30:03,617
Okay.

286
00:30:03,777 --> 00:30:04,017
Yeah.

287
00:30:04,117 --> 00:30:09,900
So, um, I'd be happy to, uh, entertain any questions that you might have about what's going on.

288
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:14,281
Uh, we will be entertaining most of them next week on the 26th.

289
00:30:14,301 --> 00:30:18,023
We'll be having a subcommittee meeting back here on, uh, on zoom.

290
00:30:18,563 --> 00:30:19,444
Uh, but I'd be more than, uh,

291
00:30:20,988 --> 00:30:22,809
Welcome to answer any questions, thank you.

292
00:30:23,649 --> 00:30:24,610
Thank you, John.

293
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:36,936
Mayor, I would recommend that we would just stick with our process of getting through the presentation and then myself, John, Dr. Edwards, and others would be happy to answer questions in total if that works for you.

294
00:30:36,956 --> 00:30:38,516
That works for me.

295
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:39,457
Okay, thank you.

296
00:30:40,637 --> 00:30:49,202
So as we move over to the rest of the central administration, the offices of the superintendent and my own office,

297
00:30:51,633 --> 00:30:56,495
We mentioned before that there are a number of departments that fit in within these large umbrellas.

298
00:30:56,835 --> 00:31:00,217
Buildings and grounds, certainly one of the largest and frankly, one of the most visible.

299
00:31:00,617 --> 00:31:05,859
And so we certainly, that's why we asked Mr. McLaughlin to be present tonight to talk about some of the specifics.

300
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:13,582
And just really quickly on the last point with regard to this budget related to the HVAC enhancements at the high school.

301
00:31:14,002 --> 00:31:17,764
It's a good example, frankly, of that maintenance and capital distinction.

302
00:31:18,646 --> 00:31:31,716
When we upgraded some of the filters around the high school in order to enhance air quality, we incurred an additional fixed cost with regard to filter replacement.

303
00:31:32,216 --> 00:31:41,323
Part of using the higher grade filters is that we moved from a twice yearly to a quarterly replacement system.

304
00:31:41,443 --> 00:31:46,027
That's not a significant cost, frankly, for the district, but it's a maintenance cost.

305
00:31:46,407 --> 00:31:47,648
As opposed to a boiler,

306
00:31:48,215 --> 00:31:56,638
or a transformer generator, one of these pieces that we certainly, we have no expectation that we would be incurring costs on an annual basis.

307
00:31:56,698 --> 00:32:02,200
And that's something that we would incorporate into a capital budget and capital planning in the years ahead.

308
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:16,925
So with regard to the superintendent's budget and the Office of Finance and Operations budget, there are pieces of this that, as I mentioned before, are interconnected with some of the other priorities and some of the other

309
00:32:17,899 --> 00:32:21,303
strategic investments that have been recommended to you.

310
00:32:21,423 --> 00:32:42,402
First, with regard to the superintendent's budget, you've heard our focus throughout the course of this year, excuse me, throughout the course of this budget development process on making sure that we're identifying professional development and training opportunities for staff that are consistent with the needs of the district during this post-COVID context.

311
00:32:44,023 --> 00:32:51,885
Well, the $75,000, which it actually might be a little bit lower than that, because it's going to be spread out over two or three fiscal years.

312
00:32:53,145 --> 00:32:55,005
So it'll be a little lower than that.

313
00:32:55,605 --> 00:33:06,308
We've identified professional development opportunities that will be intensive and will be responsive to the context in which the district will continue to function in the years ahead.

314
00:33:07,228 --> 00:33:12,149
And so we have some specific social and emotional professional development

315
00:33:12,911 --> 00:33:28,562
as well as implicit bias training that will actually begin at the tail end of fiscal year 21 and then carry over into the succeeding fiscal years open to staff generally at the beginning and administrators.

316
00:33:29,222 --> 00:33:32,825
It'll be a required program toward the end of the summer of 2021.

317
00:33:33,205 --> 00:33:42,111
So if either Dr. Edward Vincent or Dr. Cushing wanna talk a little bit about, a little more about the benefits and how we see this training

318
00:33:42,718 --> 00:33:48,901
as fitting in to the overall strategy that we've been advocating for throughout this process.

319
00:33:49,181 --> 00:33:50,662
And just one final point as a matter.

320
00:33:51,642 --> 00:34:00,527
I do anticipate that the majority of this funding of these expenses will be covered by some of the external funds that we referenced at the beginning of the presentation.

321
00:34:00,567 --> 00:34:10,592
So Title II in particular, as well as potentially some of the ESSER funding, but Title II specifically will be used both to cover the costs that will be incurred for the FY21

322
00:34:11,869 --> 00:34:14,954
portion and then moving into FY 22 as well.

323
00:34:15,034 --> 00:34:26,529
So I'm not sure if either Dr. I just wanted to stress the value and importance of

324
00:34:27,225 --> 00:34:32,991
quality professional development and truly in working in collaboration with Dr. Cushing as well.

325
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:42,821
In order to address some of the significant shifts that we're going to be making next year, especially in the area of social emotional learning.

326
00:34:44,522 --> 00:35:00,637
One of the areas that was a charge by the school committee was in terms of how the district will be addressing suspension, which does fall under the umbrella of social emotional learning behaviors, etc.

327
00:35:00,697 --> 00:35:02,939
So that is definitely a large priority

328
00:35:03,539 --> 00:35:07,980
for us, and that is one of the targeted areas for professional development.

329
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:21,743
In addition to that, we are going to be continuing our pursuit of understanding and greater professional development on implicit bias and the implications for our school communities.

330
00:35:23,123 --> 00:35:32,665
We also are going to be having additional professional development on best practices as instructional leaders and educators

331
00:35:33,212 --> 00:35:40,676
in regards to the educator evaluation system to increase accountability across all of our schools.

332
00:35:41,156 --> 00:35:43,637
So those are three large buckets.

333
00:35:43,737 --> 00:35:54,042
And when we're addressing implicit bias, that does also address cultural proficiency, anti-racist work, anti-hate,

334
00:35:55,282 --> 00:36:06,685
So all of those initiatives are very important as we are shifting as a district to meet the needs of all of our students and the greater community.

335
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:17,528
We also will continue looking at disability awareness and finding ways, again, how that overlaps with biases

336
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:19,409
that do exist out there.

337
00:36:19,949 --> 00:36:35,877
So I just wanted to stress that although you see our priority, district-wide priorities on professional development, in order to shift mindsets and really present new information, professional development is critically important.

338
00:36:36,337 --> 00:36:38,038
So I just wanted to stress that piece.

339
00:36:38,698 --> 00:36:39,078
Thank you.

340
00:36:39,759 --> 00:36:41,379
Thank you, Superintendent.

341
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:46,782
Dr. Cushing, anything you wanted to add based on your involvement with these programs?

342
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:53,798
Yes, just real quickly, the superintendent did a marvelous job explaining the positions that we're looking to move forward with.

343
00:36:53,938 --> 00:37:09,632
We also what we're doing is we are going to be the end of June offering a train the trainer program for the implicit bias and social emotional learning in the classroom and each of those courses will have 20 staff members across the district.

344
00:37:10,327 --> 00:37:15,988
uh, trained to be able to then deploy the district to deploy the professional development within the district.

345
00:37:16,048 --> 00:37:29,811
And what this model is going to allow us to do is it's going to allow us to be very cost effective, but then it's going to also allow us to deploy the professional development across the year in a way that best fits Medford's needs.

346
00:37:30,591 --> 00:37:34,492
Um, and we'll be able to better, um, engage our staff.

347
00:37:35,491 --> 00:37:49,983
with their peers and their school leaders, be them directors or principals or assistant principals, who are going to take these trainings and then will turn around and be able to deploy this world-class professional development for them.

348
00:37:51,364 --> 00:37:58,289
And I think it's a great opportunity for Medford to take the next step in providing the best professional development possible for our staff.

349
00:38:00,431 --> 00:38:02,132
Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

350
00:38:03,183 --> 00:38:06,305
And then turning to the finance and operations office.

351
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:09,047
And as you can see, there's a few different bullets here.

352
00:38:09,087 --> 00:38:17,833
I'm gonna focus on three, including transportation that I believe has its own slide and it does, thanks.

353
00:38:19,233 --> 00:38:24,857
But so first, the first two, this was alluded to during last night's presentation.

354
00:38:24,877 --> 00:38:31,962
And I believe it came up in the context of the priority identified by the English learner department

355
00:38:33,544 --> 00:38:44,834
wanting to invest in an opportunity to build out our, essentially our family engagement and our community relations efforts.

356
00:38:45,574 --> 00:39:01,307
And I made the point at the time that part of why we haven't identified a specific investment in the EL department specifically for FY22 is because we have a district investment that we are hopeful will advance that cause and we'll be working

357
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:06,123
closely with the EL department, health services department, special education, and elsewhere.

358
00:39:07,944 --> 00:39:28,877
I think that when we think about how we structure the organization and how we organize specific portfolios of work, as a general rule, the best practice is to identify the need, identify either the need that's being met or a need that develops as a result of other change variables,

359
00:39:29,642 --> 00:39:37,606
and then determine how best to develop roles and portfolios that fit together in an organizational structure that can advance those goals.

360
00:39:38,106 --> 00:39:53,593
There are times, however, when there are a confluence of events where we have individuals serving in leadership roles with available capacity and needs that are emerging and becoming more urgent.

361
00:39:54,193 --> 00:39:58,675
And the sort of confluence occurred throughout the course of the school year

362
00:39:59,757 --> 00:40:09,559
And I will be frank, one of the ways it came to our attention was when we needed to deploy our entire administrator unit into schools to serve as substitute teachers.

363
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:28,564
And when it became clear how that was taxing and virtually impossible, and we tried to make different modifications, our director before and after school programming continued to volunteer to take that on and kept communicating to us as she had for some time that she felt as though

364
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:40,386
there was room in her portfolio for additional responsibilities and the sort of confidences, the competence that we have in the individual as an administrator and as a leader.

365
00:40:40,806 --> 00:40:58,175
And the fact that how we've sort of gotten through this school year, but in being able to identify practices that we can improve and work that we can do better in the area of parent and family engagement,

366
00:40:58,573 --> 00:41:11,922
was by enlisting the assistance of Diane Caldwell, our former associate superintendent, who has very ably worked as the lead manager of the Parent Information Center.

367
00:41:12,482 --> 00:41:23,890
And I will say, as someone who was new to the district and inherited the Parent Information Center as part of my portfolio in my first week, without Ms.

368
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:24,330
Caldwell,

369
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:43,624
being available to provide that leadership and to provide that guidance and institutional knowledge, it would have been a much, much more challenging year, not just with regard to oversight of the PIC, but with regard to essentially all other elements of the work that myself and other senior administrators are responsible for.

370
00:41:43,704 --> 00:41:46,326
But we've known since the beginning that Ms.

371
00:41:46,346 --> 00:41:54,192
Caldwell as the administrator of the Parent Information Center was not a permanent solution, and trying to operate within

372
00:41:54,930 --> 00:42:08,373
our budgetary parameters, we weren't necessarily looking to fund a director of the Parent Information Center as just as a single position with no other responsibilities.

373
00:42:08,813 --> 00:42:09,453
And so Ms.

374
00:42:09,493 --> 00:42:13,494
Fidler carries willingness and eagerness to take on additional responsibility.

375
00:42:14,035 --> 00:42:24,097
And what we felt is a strong natural nexus between the Parent Information Center and the Poor and Absent School Program, as well as the additional

376
00:42:25,842 --> 00:42:33,307
uh, capacity that we needed to, um, needed in the, in the, in the realm of, of family relationships with regards to transportation.

377
00:42:33,947 --> 00:42:39,070
Um, we thought that this fit together as a legitimate, um, full administrative portfolio.

378
00:42:39,531 --> 00:42:54,260
And so as part of the FY 22 budget, uh, we are proposing to reorganize those offices into one umbrella, uh, uh, area of family engagement that will include oversight of the parent information center, uh, continued oversight of the before and after school program.

379
00:42:54,743 --> 00:42:56,864
and service as a transportation liaison.

380
00:42:57,285 --> 00:43:09,952
Now, all of these roles, frankly, one of the reasons they fit together is that it is different parts of the school year where they require a greater degree of attention and detail.

381
00:43:10,352 --> 00:43:22,720
And so it's sort of, that's why I say it's sort of a confluence in that it fit together nicely in terms of putting together a full 12 month position with someone who already has the institutional knowledge

382
00:43:23,258 --> 00:43:26,499
and has done strong work for the district in the past.

383
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:45,346
And that's part of why being able to do so efficiently, but also with confidence as to how that would more effectively advance the district's goals with regard to both family and community partnerships is part of how that proposal has developed.

384
00:43:46,386 --> 00:43:47,207
So that's one piece.

385
00:43:47,287 --> 00:43:50,988
And then you see, as was also mentioned last night,

386
00:43:51,826 --> 00:43:53,806
we've established a grant coordinator position.

387
00:43:54,567 --> 00:44:20,832
That alone is a sort of a non-budgetary, doesn't necessarily have an effect on the operating budget and that the grants that the individual who has been serving as essentially an unofficial grant coordinator for some time, but technically in the role of an executive assistant, we've been able to move that person into the finance and operations office, working with Michelle Kingdon and her staff to ensure that we are

388
00:44:21,569 --> 00:44:29,753
meeting all of our obligations and executing from a compliance perspective as effectively as possible.

389
00:44:30,253 --> 00:44:31,814
That is different, and I want to point this out.

390
00:44:31,834 --> 00:44:48,742
It's certainly different than the grant writer role that we currently don't have, but we're exploring other ways in which we might be able to free up some capacity to give administrators the opportunity to be well positioned to cultivate external partnerships and

391
00:44:50,258 --> 00:45:01,804
and pursue grant opportunities that our grant coordinator would then be in a position to help coordinate and try to free up additional budgetary capacity in that way.

392
00:45:03,965 --> 00:45:08,187
Before I move on to transportation, I'll just say, and again, it's a bit of a continuation from our conversation last night.

393
00:45:09,128 --> 00:45:19,593
We have continued our partnership throughout this school year with the Management Solution and Mr. Paquette, who served as the interim

394
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:23,083
a business administrator between Ms.

395
00:45:23,103 --> 00:45:23,963
Patterson and myself.

396
00:45:24,924 --> 00:45:30,889
And we have the report that was commissioned is ready to be provided to the school committee.

397
00:45:31,649 --> 00:45:42,878
I have asked for essentially an appendix to the report because when the report was done over the course of the school year and sort of bled into this budget development process.

398
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:47,282
And I've asked Mr. Parkett if based on the retainer fee that we still have,

399
00:45:47,997 --> 00:45:55,700
he can complete just essentially a short supplement to that, that would take into account some of the changes that we put into, Ms.

400
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:59,842
Kimu and myself have put into effect over the course of the last several months.

401
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:03,423
And so I anticipate providing that to the committee prior to the end of this fiscal year.

402
00:46:04,224 --> 00:46:14,988
And then Mr. Parkett, our partnership with Tufts University that began as a partnership in the testing realm and has progressed to conversations

403
00:46:15,465 --> 00:46:25,353
within a technology infrastructure realm and something that I'm hopeful we'll be able to benefit from with great efficiency over the course of the summer.

404
00:46:26,094 --> 00:46:36,763
But then also we'll be looking to explore what other external expertise we should be retaining or potentially consulting with as we look toward FY22.

405
00:46:36,803 --> 00:46:38,864
So that's a high level overview.

406
00:46:38,904 --> 00:46:43,548
I'm gonna finish up with transportation and then I will move on to your questions.

407
00:46:44,868 --> 00:46:53,270
If you remember when we talked about the projections for FY22, we had, we were looking at about 51,000 increased costs.

408
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:56,750
These are, I should just say quickly because it was touched upon on May 6th.

409
00:46:57,050 --> 00:47:02,352
These are unrelated to our fixed costs in transportation related to our special education.

410
00:47:03,372 --> 00:47:07,313
These are our main vendor, Eastern Bus.

411
00:47:07,773 --> 00:47:12,014
The school committee entered into a three year, a new three year contract in the spring of 2020.

412
00:47:12,394 --> 00:47:14,334
So we're completing the first of those

413
00:47:14,743 --> 00:47:15,844
of the three-year contract.

414
00:47:16,244 --> 00:47:20,587
As is always the case with contracts, there is an increase in the cost on a year-to-year basis.

415
00:47:21,308 --> 00:47:30,934
So we're looking at approximately $51,000 increase in that contract as part of our estimated $2.1 million increase in fixed costs.

416
00:47:31,775 --> 00:47:39,921
You've seen the next two numbers previously on April 26 when there was a request made about the MBTA passes.

417
00:47:40,461 --> 00:47:42,963
That is essentially an option that we're

418
00:47:43,573 --> 00:47:45,734
making sure that the committee is aware of.

419
00:47:46,594 --> 00:48:00,299
And then there were questions related to the, what would essentially be the cost for additional yellow buses and potentially providing additional Eastern bus capacity at the high school.

420
00:48:00,839 --> 00:48:02,480
It is, we estimate somewhere about $75,000.

421
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:06,121
The reason why I say that's zero to $75,000, that in our conversations with the vendor, they have,

422
00:48:12,162 --> 00:48:39,068
I think, and I appreciate this, I don't know that every vendor would, but they have suggested that based on the radius that this district adopted prior to this school year, it may be that with regard to elementary and middle school transportation, it may be possible to repurpose some of our existing capacity to provide at least one additional bus to the high school.

423
00:48:39,568 --> 00:48:41,428
We have meetings next week with

424
00:48:41,755 --> 00:48:55,461
the bus vendor as well as the Medford Police Department, where we'll be looking at a number of issues, both related to safety and planning out some of the development of routes and stops for the next school year over the course of the summer.

425
00:48:56,301 --> 00:49:03,364
And so I frankly don't have a recommendation to the committee at this time related to whether we should add a second bus.

426
00:49:03,804 --> 00:49:06,525
I think it's clear that it's possible that we would be able to.

427
00:49:06,946 --> 00:49:10,327
And then I think it's a question of looking at the data as to where

428
00:49:11,831 --> 00:49:14,472
the high school students are and whether there is a demand for that.

429
00:49:15,013 --> 00:49:25,239
I will say that in my brief conversations with the high school administration, it's not entirely clear that we know that there is a clear demand for this, which is something I think we do want to take into account.

430
00:49:25,999 --> 00:49:40,528
But at the same time, if the cost is somewhere between zero and $75,000 to provide something that could be much more convenient for students, that's obviously something we would want to consider.

431
00:49:41,587 --> 00:49:48,212
I think from a strategic perspective, we have to take into account that the MBTA passes obviously provide potentially more access.

432
00:49:49,633 --> 00:49:54,517
And, you know, you get into thinking about student jobs, the opportunity to go into the city.

433
00:49:55,157 --> 00:50:04,904
There are other sort of like city as a classroom experiences and experiential learning experiences that the MBTA passes could yield for students.

434
00:50:06,568 --> 00:50:08,069
We're looking at all of those options.

435
00:50:08,349 --> 00:50:31,348
And again, a common thread that's cut across all of the presentations is our determination to establish effective extended school day and after school programming for our students in the 21-22 school year through use of the ESSER funds to ensure that we're providing as much remedial support as possible coming out of the significant disruptions that students have faced.

436
00:50:32,539 --> 00:50:36,562
So I thank you for your time and your indulgence with regard to that.

437
00:50:37,523 --> 00:50:48,630
If you enjoyed the presentations when there were more testimonials and witnesses for me to turn over the presentation to, I promise you I enjoyed that more as well.

438
00:50:49,331 --> 00:50:56,396
But those are the presentations for buildings and grounds, the office of finance and operations, as well as the superintendent's office.

439
00:50:56,436 --> 00:50:59,118
And at this time, I would be more than happy to take your questions.

440
00:51:02,978 --> 00:51:03,919
Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

441
00:51:03,959 --> 00:51:06,161
We have member Van de Kloet, then member Rousseau.

442
00:51:08,903 --> 00:51:09,283
Thank you.

443
00:51:09,723 --> 00:51:14,467
I'm going to pick up right at the end about the busing for the high school.

444
00:51:15,188 --> 00:51:26,417
Dave, you've presented us with some interesting options, but with quite big differences in pricing.

445
00:51:27,638 --> 00:51:29,500
At this point, as you're building this budget,

446
00:51:30,347 --> 00:51:35,008
What are you, are you making a recommendation to us?

447
00:51:35,088 --> 00:51:39,709
Are we gonna, I mean, how are you going to factor in the cost into the budget?

448
00:51:40,169 --> 00:51:54,331
Well, I think the first, yeah, the first determination is if the committee is comfortable with the radius that was established last year with regard to the one mile radius for all grades with the exception of kindergarten.

449
00:51:54,791 --> 00:51:58,492
So if that's something that the committee wants to stand by,

450
00:51:58,939 --> 00:52:03,781
then the vendor has essentially said that one of the elementary schools is going to have excess capacity.

451
00:52:04,161 --> 00:52:23,327
And so the existing contract that would be the $1.4 million or something in that range for Eastern Bus is gonna provide us with an additional school bus that I think we should probably consider use at the high school to expand that capacity.

452
00:52:23,368 --> 00:52:24,488
My only hesitation is

453
00:52:25,267 --> 00:52:35,114
that if we didn't, it's possible that we could be repurposing that for after school and extended school day programming without that additional potential $100,000 cost.

454
00:52:35,195 --> 00:52:37,997
Or at least it would defray that.

455
00:52:38,037 --> 00:52:48,985
So I think the first determination is, is the committee comfortable with the one mile radius, which according to the vendor will not have a dramatic impact on ridership.

456
00:52:49,045 --> 00:52:51,287
And it's essentially that's where we are now.

457
00:52:52,948 --> 00:52:54,069
And if that's the case,

458
00:52:54,700 --> 00:53:04,143
then I think the next step is to look at the data related to where high school students are residing and whether or not there's a route that makes sense where students are.

459
00:53:04,763 --> 00:53:15,027
And again, the only downside I would see in that plan is that the MBTA passes, they don't just take you to school.

460
00:53:15,747 --> 00:53:23,990
And I think particularly for our high school students, there's a tremendous amount of experiential learning opportunities that having MBTA passes could open them up for.

461
00:53:25,131 --> 00:53:34,495
And the only last thing I would say to that is that the MBTA pass has become a much better investment if we are tying programmatic opportunities to their procurement.

462
00:53:34,895 --> 00:53:49,240
And I think that it may just take some time, perhaps the summer is a sufficient amount of time, to give our instructional leaders the time to develop those types of opportunities that then maximize that potential investment.

463
00:53:50,138 --> 00:53:54,221
So Dave, let's go back to one of the things you said about the mile radius.

464
00:53:54,261 --> 00:53:57,083
And I have to tell you, I really don't recall taking any vote on that.

465
00:53:59,024 --> 00:54:12,753
So- So this was preceded in my time, but my understanding is that when that reopening plan was presented to the school committee in mass as a large sort of multifaceted plan, the radius was a piece of that.

466
00:54:13,233 --> 00:54:15,455
And so the routes, the stops were adjusted.

467
00:54:15,475 --> 00:54:18,797
I also think, and I know this only anecdotally,

468
00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:31,333
that because ridership was so diminished this year, that if you're, typically you eliminate bus stops and you hear a sort of wave of commentary, that didn't materialize this year.

469
00:54:31,753 --> 00:54:35,898
And it may be because ridership was so diminished due to the pandemic.

470
00:54:36,399 --> 00:54:39,683
If that doesn't carry over to next year, that's something that you probably want to consider.

471
00:54:40,253 --> 00:54:45,197
Yeah, I would be, I think it was perfectly understandable that our ridership diminished a great deal.

472
00:54:45,217 --> 00:55:01,150
I know in Medford, there's been a history of some students receiving bus service because of concerns about the roads where they live, the safety of it.

473
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:06,394
So to just say automatically it's a mile, well, it's never been just automatically a mile.

474
00:55:07,655 --> 00:55:09,577
An important point, and I apologize for that,

475
00:55:10,613 --> 00:55:15,135
if I assume that that would go without saying, the radius has nothing to do with safety exemptions.

476
00:55:15,715 --> 00:55:21,718
And so your bus stop, that is part of the conversation that we're having next week.

477
00:55:21,738 --> 00:55:26,960
And it's why it's not just the district and the vendor, it's why the Metro Police Department will be represented as well.

478
00:55:27,601 --> 00:55:38,025
Because as we go through and looking at routes and stops, we want to ensure that any stops that have been any concerns about related to safety are being looked at closely by public safety experts and that

479
00:55:38,385 --> 00:55:43,206
is certainly, you know, the safety exemptions override any other policies with regard to radius.

480
00:55:44,167 --> 00:55:53,749
Yeah, well, part of it is, you know, perceived safety or it's been in place for such a long time, any move to take away will certainly cause an uproar.

481
00:55:54,750 --> 00:56:03,392
So it seems like, I hear you on the optimistic level, we're gonna have some space and so we can utilize an existing bus

482
00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:13,857
That does sound very optimistic to me, Dave, and I am optimistic in general, but- I'm not so ready to balance each other out there.

483
00:56:13,877 --> 00:56:17,039
Yeah, and at the high end, it's 350, which is a huge chunk of change.

484
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:27,967
And there are some, I'm just trying to say as we, with such a big number, it's hard to understand exactly where you're gonna come down to in terms of what we're putting into the budget.

485
00:56:29,268 --> 00:56:32,030
Yeah, that's all a fair point.

486
00:56:33,110 --> 00:56:36,472
This data is in response to inquiries by the committee, just to be clear.

487
00:56:36,552 --> 00:56:40,173
I don't, I don't, I certainly don't have a recommendation as to where the 350,000 would come from.

488
00:56:40,193 --> 00:56:42,274
So just to be candid about that.

489
00:56:42,294 --> 00:56:42,795
Okay.

490
00:56:43,415 --> 00:56:43,775
Yeah.

491
00:56:43,875 --> 00:56:52,239
And the same time, and I appreciate the, uh, my colleagues having raised this issue because it is an issue and it is a, uh, a fairness issue.

492
00:56:52,339 --> 00:56:56,061
So, um, I think clearly we're going to have to have more conversations on it.

493
00:56:56,901 --> 00:56:57,141
Okay.

494
00:56:57,441 --> 00:56:58,282
I yield to someone else.

495
00:57:01,005 --> 00:57:04,126
We have member Rousseau, the member Kretz, Graham, and McLaughlin.

496
00:57:06,066 --> 00:57:06,666
Thank you, mayor.

497
00:57:07,407 --> 00:57:08,567
Thank you for the presentation.

498
00:57:08,587 --> 00:57:10,107
I do appreciate it.

499
00:57:11,007 --> 00:57:22,010
I am wondering where, and forgive me if we've already covered it, but I don't think we have transportation for sports and band.

500
00:57:23,210 --> 00:57:25,711
And is that coming up?

501
00:57:28,128 --> 00:57:31,490
The question is, is that included in this data before you tonight?

502
00:57:32,330 --> 00:57:32,630
Yes.

503
00:57:33,891 --> 00:57:38,033
No, but only because it lives in the athletic or fine arts budgets.

504
00:57:38,574 --> 00:57:41,335
And so those lines will be restored to their FY.

505
00:57:42,236 --> 00:57:49,540
One of them was never reduced, but they'll either be maintained or restored to their FY 20 numbers.

506
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:56,764
So to ensure that we have sufficient transportation to all events and athletic events and things of that nature.

507
00:57:57,214 --> 00:58:00,596
And that was by request by those department heads.

508
00:58:00,636 --> 00:58:06,140
So there was no, to the best of my knowledge, there was no request to exceed the pre-FY21 levels.

509
00:58:07,681 --> 00:58:08,502
Okay, thank you.

510
00:58:09,002 --> 00:58:20,110
I just, you know, it feels like remembering pre-pandemic sometimes is actually a challenge, but, you know, my memory is that, you know,

511
00:58:20,928 --> 00:58:27,910
We did not have an equitable distribution of transportation funding for different kinds of groups that I'll just say it.

512
00:58:28,210 --> 00:58:38,454
We were more than generous with the sports related transportation funding and the band folks had to sell whatever they had to sell to get enough money for busing.

513
00:58:39,654 --> 00:58:42,315
And this is my fourth budget.

514
00:58:43,075 --> 00:58:46,036
And for four years now, I've not been alone in saying

515
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:52,551
we need a breakdown of what we're spending on extracurriculars per student.

516
00:58:54,672 --> 00:59:00,293
Because just trusting my gut, I don't have kids to participate in sports.

517
00:59:00,373 --> 00:59:02,253
I do have kids that participate in band.

518
00:59:02,953 --> 00:59:09,675
I'm not interested in making grand statements or suggesting policy changes without any data.

519
00:59:10,115 --> 00:59:14,296
But my sense, looking at the stipends for sports,

520
00:59:15,266 --> 00:59:31,312
coaches in our contract versus the people that are running the band and other stipends, there's clearly some kind of discrepancy that maybe is appropriate based on the number of hours put into it, but I have no way to know.

521
00:59:31,673 --> 00:59:42,957
And so I really want to know that we are not favoring kids who decide to participate in a sport and lessening the burden on their families to fundraise for transportation.

522
00:59:43,528 --> 00:59:48,131
compared to kids that are in band or, and I'm just using those two examples.

523
00:59:48,292 --> 00:59:49,512
I'm sure there are others.

524
00:59:51,834 --> 01:00:02,202
So, restoration obviously is better than not restoration, but I just don't have any way to know that this is in fact fair.

525
01:00:02,902 --> 01:00:07,586
And that's really, it's a big issue for me.

526
01:00:07,746 --> 01:00:10,728
And this is the fourth budget where this has been a topic

527
01:00:11,318 --> 01:00:15,501
the fourth year where I've wanted, and I realize you were not in the last three budgets.

528
01:00:16,041 --> 01:00:20,684
So, but you know, a breakdown of per student, what are we spending?

529
01:00:21,725 --> 01:00:24,787
And I mean, that includes the stipends that are in the teacher's contracts.

530
01:00:24,827 --> 01:00:33,192
And that, I mean, all the money that we spend on not the K to eight education, what are we spending?

531
01:00:33,332 --> 01:00:34,073
Where's it going?

532
01:00:34,393 --> 01:00:36,514
And is it actually fair?

533
01:00:36,815 --> 01:00:40,617
I mean, cause I mean, I know that sports are matter a lot to a lot of people,

534
01:00:41,156 --> 01:00:42,996
ban matters an awful lot to a lot of people.

535
01:00:44,317 --> 01:00:48,158
And I just really think we have to get to the bottom of that.

536
01:00:48,178 --> 01:00:50,218
I don't think this is something we can solve tonight.

537
01:00:50,418 --> 01:00:57,880
And I was just surprised to not really get a sense so far as to whether or not that's being addressed.

538
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:01,041
But I realized, of course, that you weren't there for the last three budgets, so.

539
01:01:01,081 --> 01:01:01,241
Yeah.

540
01:01:01,661 --> 01:01:03,401
No, it's a great question.

541
01:01:03,481 --> 01:01:04,522
And I think you're right.

542
01:01:04,702 --> 01:01:08,223
I mean, sometimes there's different level of expenses.

543
01:01:08,243 --> 01:01:09,743
I think more often than not,

544
01:01:10,282 --> 01:01:15,583
this discrepancy is created at districts because of the peace system that's in place around the athletics.

545
01:01:15,643 --> 01:01:35,408
And I think that is how you often end up seeing that discrepancy, but they play a very parallel role in terms of being the element of our educational program that engages students and keeps them frankly coming here and certainly enjoying themselves and making the most of their education.

546
01:01:35,428 --> 01:01:40,129
So I'm happy to dig into that deeper and to see if there are

547
01:01:40,714 --> 01:01:42,775
if there are gaps that potentially we need to help bridge.

548
01:01:44,757 --> 01:01:45,597
Thank you.

549
01:01:45,778 --> 01:01:58,106
And so I guess I'll just ask my other question around, I see there's the projects around bathrooms.

550
01:01:59,047 --> 01:02:06,452
Again, this is my fourth year and this is the fourth year that students are doing the hard work of figuring out how to get menstrual products to our students.

551
01:02:07,153 --> 01:02:08,353
It's embarrassing.

552
01:02:09,584 --> 01:02:13,586
I know that not everybody on this meeting necessarily agrees, but it is embarrassing.

553
01:02:13,866 --> 01:02:25,753
Four years in a row, there are CCSR projects to make sure that the students that are menstruating don't have a problem getting access to these products.

554
01:02:26,614 --> 01:02:28,835
It's just kind of mind-foggling.

555
01:02:29,836 --> 01:02:32,217
And I just wanna be clear that I won't vote for any

556
01:02:33,617 --> 01:02:40,281
bathroom renovations if they do not include free menstrual product dispensers in every renovated bathroom.

557
01:02:42,382 --> 01:02:43,182
Dr. Edward Vincent?

558
01:02:44,503 --> 01:02:47,685
I just want to comment, Member Rousseau, that when you make

559
01:02:49,389 --> 01:03:03,631
The statements, people will be led to believe that when female students are using the restrooms that they don't have access to feminine products at the high school, we have an entire medical suite.

560
01:03:05,181 --> 01:03:12,667
Feminine products are placed in the restrooms, but unfortunately, sometimes the feminine products are not used for their proper purpose.

561
01:03:13,268 --> 01:03:19,113
They are used, they're decorated on the bathroom stalls, they end up on the ceilings.

562
01:03:19,673 --> 01:03:21,695
That has happened multiple times as well.

563
01:03:22,255 --> 01:03:25,438
And that's with people supervising and monitoring the restrooms.

564
01:03:25,498 --> 01:03:28,441
So we do put them there, CCSR students,

565
01:03:29,461 --> 01:03:41,407
do take that on as a project, but I do want people to know that feminine products are available in the medical suite and students are not denied access.

566
01:03:41,587 --> 01:03:57,375
We have ample products in the medical suite and I'm not opposed to getting machines that students can have access to, but I just want to state that when we've provided them, they were not used for the proper purpose.

567
01:03:58,035 --> 01:04:02,756
which was part of the reason why they ended up being removed in the past.

568
01:04:02,976 --> 01:04:11,957
So I just wanna say that we're not trying to target students or say to them that, you know, it's not available.

569
01:04:12,097 --> 01:04:21,419
I want everyone to know it is available and there are ample supplies in the medical suite at the high school in particular, and at the middle schools as well.

570
01:04:22,319 --> 01:04:25,140
It's available in all the nursing offices.

571
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:26,820
Thank you.

572
01:04:27,827 --> 01:04:29,248
If I could just quickly respond, Mayor.

573
01:04:29,988 --> 01:04:31,829
Yes, and then member Kratz.

574
01:04:32,290 --> 01:04:33,570
Yeah, I understand that.

575
01:04:33,651 --> 01:04:38,013
And I would never for a second suggest anybody is trying to deny these things.

576
01:04:38,353 --> 01:04:47,379
I would just suggest that we get a map of the high school and imagine a student who is at the furthest point from the medical suite.

577
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:54,323
And I mean, of the school committee members, I'm the only one here

578
01:04:55,310 --> 01:04:56,570
hasn't had these experiences.

579
01:04:56,650 --> 01:05:11,214
I'm just making assumptions about you all, but, you know, even I can't even imagine being as far away from the medical suite as you can be in this building that is just vast and being told, you know where it is.

580
01:05:13,955 --> 01:05:16,036
I walked that building to get to whatever.

581
01:05:16,176 --> 01:05:19,817
And I'm like, first of all, it is not a two minute walk.

582
01:05:19,937 --> 01:05:24,118
We're talking, I mean, I don't even know what the timing is, but I just think that the,

583
01:05:24,805 --> 01:05:35,247
the bar for what we think of as access seems just to be really, really low and, or high, whatever the right analogy is.

584
01:05:35,827 --> 01:05:43,888
And I just, you know, there are other districts have done this and I don't, they don't make the front page of the globe as becoming a huge problem.

585
01:05:44,748 --> 01:05:54,570
And I understand that, you know, what I've read about, you know, the healthy, it's not the Healthy Youth Act, I forget which act it was that would actually require these in schools last year,

586
01:05:55,301 --> 01:06:09,505
But there is an initial like, when you first install these and make them available for free, they're gonna be stuck to the ceiling and they're gonna be kids that need them might take home baskets full of them.

587
01:06:10,586 --> 01:06:13,267
But like a lot of things, they're gonna get bored of it.

588
01:06:14,167 --> 01:06:16,308
And then when students need them, they'll be there.

589
01:06:16,408 --> 01:06:21,109
So I don't pretend it's a super like no effort kind of project.

590
01:06:21,669 --> 01:06:23,170
I just firmly believe that,

591
01:06:24,275 --> 01:06:32,883
The CCSR, I believe it was a CCSR project, and it came across my inbox on Facebook, I think a week ago, about students that are doing this.

592
01:06:33,984 --> 01:06:36,085
They're not doing this because they got nothing else to do.

593
01:06:37,407 --> 01:06:39,488
So I just think we're not listening to the students.

594
01:06:39,789 --> 01:06:45,574
I'm looking at the CCSR page from 2016, and that's one of their projects from that year.

595
01:06:45,594 --> 01:06:50,278
And I just don't know when we're gonna get to it, but thank you.

596
01:06:52,217 --> 01:06:54,999
Thank you, member crest and member Graham member McLaughlin.

597
01:06:55,740 --> 01:06:58,142
Yes, I just wanted to thank.

598
01:06:58,222 --> 01:07:11,773
First off, I just have a question for the transportation but first off I just wanted to let everybody know that the presentations were excellent and Mr McLaughlin you did a great job and will those agenda items are.

599
01:07:12,153 --> 01:07:15,794
going to be on the agenda for next week so we can have a discussion next week in the subcommittee meeting.

600
01:07:16,374 --> 01:07:19,095
So the question I have is also about transportation.

601
01:07:19,115 --> 01:07:26,898
A couple things on that because I pulled up the bulletin because I don't remember it being one mile radius.

602
01:07:27,538 --> 01:07:42,003
I so I pulled up the bulletin on transportation during Kobe 2021, and it says here that every public schools will not transport students on a yellow school, whoever this physical address within two miles of the school they attend.

603
01:07:43,388 --> 01:07:51,395
We understand that this change is a significant burdens in, and have always provided transportation that exceeds the regulation.

604
01:07:51,735 --> 01:07:56,540
So I'm not sure I have even the right information.

605
01:07:57,821 --> 01:08:01,064
Mr. Murphy, what he mentioned, I don't have that information either.

606
01:08:01,244 --> 01:08:03,706
I don't recall having a meeting about that.

607
01:08:04,187 --> 01:08:07,510
So I just wanted to mention that.

608
01:08:07,530 --> 01:08:08,410
I know Ms.

609
01:08:08,550 --> 01:08:09,872
Van de Kloot talked about that.

610
01:08:12,141 --> 01:08:14,462
Mr. I just attempt to clarify.

611
01:08:15,542 --> 01:08:23,086
And I say this with the sort of disclaimer that this was before I was here, but I've been involved in it since.

612
01:08:23,126 --> 01:08:29,568
And if any, if any of my colleagues want to share their recollections, please don't please do.

613
01:08:30,489 --> 01:08:36,931
But as it was explained to me, was that when the when the committee was presented with the 2.0 mile radius,

614
01:08:39,352 --> 01:08:42,093
I, my understanding was that was for the secondary grades.

615
01:08:42,734 --> 01:08:52,378
There was an existing restriction as again, as I was, I believe I was told of a one mile at the elementary level that had essentially not been enforced.

616
01:08:53,059 --> 01:09:05,865
And that, uh, in order to bring down the total number of people riding the bus, there would be a need to inform the vendor to enforce that radius at one mile at the elementary level and two miles at the secondary level.

617
01:09:06,545 --> 01:09:08,686
Um, the.

618
01:09:10,068 --> 01:09:18,253
number of people riding the bus has diminished so significantly that it's not clear, frankly, that the vendor needed to enforce the one mile radius.

619
01:09:18,413 --> 01:09:21,795
And so this also, by the way, I should say, does not apply to kindergarten.

620
01:09:21,855 --> 01:09:31,400
So the exceptions are kindergarten safety exemptions and students with disabilities, as with transportation as part of the IEP, are, of course, not related to this conversation either.

621
01:09:31,460 --> 01:09:36,884
But the one and two mile radiuses, one was based on the COVID restriction and the other was

622
01:09:37,970 --> 01:09:45,233
just essentially an unenforced restriction that is not uncommon in districts, frankly, to have, particularly when there's room on the bus.

623
01:09:45,713 --> 01:09:51,695
And that's sort of what we would go into this summer in terms of planning routes and stops with the vendor at that radius.

624
01:09:51,835 --> 01:10:00,278
And the vendor has advised that if we were to do that, we likely would have within the 18 buses that are contemplated by the contract

625
01:10:01,372 --> 01:10:10,195
that was approved last year, the likelihood is that we would only need a 17 bus fleet, and that would free up the 18th for potentially a second bus at the high school.

626
01:10:10,815 --> 01:10:15,197
So I think Dr. Cushing, I saw you raise your hand.

627
01:10:15,577 --> 01:10:19,078
If I misspoke at all, please don't hesitate to correct me.

628
01:10:19,238 --> 01:10:20,099
You did not misspeak.

629
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:21,339
You spoke very accurately.

630
01:10:21,359 --> 01:10:29,722
I guess if you could say one of the positives coming out of the pandemic was it really built up the relationship for the school principals,

631
01:10:30,547 --> 01:10:52,047
And I apologize for the person at the city level and the parent blanking on her name, but to really work on safe routes to school as a way to also reduce our fossil fuels footprint with the amount of buses stopping and starting and by creating walking school buses, safe ways for students to walk to and from school.

632
01:10:53,271 --> 01:11:22,128
and to look at other ways to make sure that we were providing safe opportunities for kids to get to school while also realizing that while this was a pandemic driven issue, there were other issues related to fossil fuels and traffic and congestion and things along those lines that were playing into the considerations as well when we were having these conversations last year, which I would say, all of our school principals at the elementary and the middle school levels

633
01:11:23,022 --> 01:11:25,284
met with people to map out routes to their schools.

634
01:11:25,384 --> 01:11:28,626
We got GIS mapping data with where all our students were.

635
01:11:28,646 --> 01:11:46,797
We did quite a comprehensive analysis to really look into all of this as we came into the pandemic and then looked at the opportunities that might exist coming out of the pandemic to shift the habits and mindsets.

636
01:11:49,150 --> 01:11:49,550
Thank you.

637
01:11:49,870 --> 01:11:50,311
Thank you.

638
01:11:51,011 --> 01:11:56,494
I just have one more question and it might just be some health information for the upcoming school year.

639
01:11:56,514 --> 01:12:03,998
And Mr Murphy I'm not sure if you were on yet but it's Patterson was aware of it that.

640
01:12:05,235 --> 01:12:21,620
Because we, we go back to school before Labor Day, and with the MBTA, the days before Labor Day, the MBTA doesn't operate for the high school students, so there's always been concern

641
01:12:23,141 --> 01:12:26,904
For the first couple of days before Labor Day when the kids are back to school.

642
01:12:27,845 --> 01:12:33,550
I, you know, we used to get messages that you know students were waiting at the bus stop the bus wasn't there.

643
01:12:34,051 --> 01:12:37,133
They ended up walking were late for school.

644
01:12:37,714 --> 01:12:41,417
So, in preparation for the upcoming school year.

645
01:12:42,707 --> 01:12:57,978
there's been an added yellow school bus that kind of travels some of the most commonly frequent stops to kind of pick up the high school students for those first couple of days.

646
01:12:58,999 --> 01:13:07,806
So I can't quite remember all the details, but I just wanted to give you the heads up about that, that that has been an ongoing issue.

647
01:13:08,426 --> 01:13:11,909
each year because we start before Labor Day.

648
01:13:12,129 --> 01:13:16,953
And then right after Labor Day, the MBT buses will run on a regular school schedule.

649
01:13:18,254 --> 01:13:18,374
Ms.

650
01:13:18,394 --> 01:13:19,615
Kretz, I really appreciate that.

651
01:13:19,875 --> 01:13:21,616
It's not something I'm familiar with.

652
01:13:21,736 --> 01:13:24,298
I will educate myself as quickly as possible.

653
01:13:25,179 --> 01:13:27,501
My first question is what happens to that bus after Labor Day?

654
01:13:27,521 --> 01:13:32,644
Because if it's available that week, I'd be a little curious how or why it would be available.

655
01:13:32,664 --> 01:13:36,007
I would say in response to that,

656
01:13:36,775 --> 01:13:56,983
It is a past practice in Medford, and the Eastern Bus Company is aware because we start school before a lot of surrounding districts, so they do, they're able to kind of shuffle their buses to get us through the initial three days before other districts end up starting.

657
01:13:57,043 --> 01:14:03,966
So they have been able to do it, and it's something they are aware of, and we will definitely continue that practice, Member Kretz.

658
01:14:04,807 --> 01:14:05,267
Thank you.

659
01:14:05,905 --> 01:14:29,169
Yeah, I think we will certainly continue to practice, but I'm also, in our meetings with Eastern Bus, I think we'll also push on the issue as to what the capacity is, because the sentiment that I heard from the committee when we discussed this in April 26 was that if there was, if there's a cost-effective way to provide additional yellow bus transportation for the high school, then that's something we should look at.

660
01:14:29,229 --> 01:14:33,730
So, but this is, again, we're gonna have many conversations, and they've been a very good partner.

661
01:14:34,290 --> 01:14:36,294
very responsive over the course of the past year.

662
01:14:37,376 --> 01:14:39,540
So my hope is that we'll be able to continue that dialogue with them.

663
01:14:40,762 --> 01:14:41,123
Thank you.

664
01:14:42,966 --> 01:14:43,427
Member Graham.

665
01:14:48,443 --> 01:14:48,843
Thank you.

666
01:14:50,405 --> 01:15:07,646
I really appreciated the attention to professional development that was laid out in the superintendent's recommendations and certainly train the trainer models can be really effective as long as there is a sustainability plan that comes with the train the trainer and it's not a

667
01:15:08,951 --> 01:15:21,163
an initial startup thing that sort of fizzles out because starting over in a train the trainer plan is very expensive, so I just want to make sure that we have sustainability plans in place to really maximize that investment.

668
01:15:23,849 --> 01:15:38,664
On the topic of transportation, I would like to make a motion that the budget include or assumes that there will be no cost to transportation for our students effective at the beginning of the 21-22 school year.

669
01:15:40,505 --> 01:15:55,684
And that the administration will bring to us a comprehensive plan that sort of lays out a recommendation around transportation for the district between now and August 1st.

670
01:15:56,365 --> 01:15:59,268
And the reason that I added that at the end is because

671
01:16:00,669 --> 01:16:15,816
I have heard overwhelmingly from people that kids taking the MBTA bus means that they're often late, and that it's not reliable, and parents are making other arrangements to get their kids to school because they don't feel they can trust the MBTA buses.

672
01:16:17,057 --> 01:16:22,459
The notion that there are yet other students who really rely on those MBTA bus passes so that they

673
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:35,307
can work and can travel on the bus in a different way is not something that I've personally heard, but I don't want to discount the fact that there are community members out there who are in that position.

674
01:16:35,928 --> 01:16:45,374
So I would like for us to revisit transportation and for you all to work with Eastern Bus and the police department and whomever

675
01:16:46,714 --> 01:16:51,075
and hopefully the community to figure out like what is the best path forward.

676
01:16:51,355 --> 01:17:02,837
I will also say Dr. Cushing that I do remember the conversation about the one versus two mile radius and the like non-enforcement of the radius at the elementary school level.

677
01:17:04,917 --> 01:17:13,079
When Mr. Murphy was talking about kindergarten being an exception, I guess I started to think like if you enforce like that,

678
01:17:14,686 --> 01:17:16,466
one mile versus two miles or whatever it is.

679
01:17:17,146 --> 01:17:20,287
And yet you still have to pick up kindergartners in a place where you wouldn't before.

680
01:17:20,347 --> 01:17:26,148
Like how do you practically or tactically only pick up kindergartners in that like closer radius?

681
01:17:26,208 --> 01:17:30,849
So I feel like there's like a lot of conversation around transportation to get it right.

682
01:17:32,009 --> 01:17:41,491
But I want unequivocally the budget to reflect that it will not cost students to get themselves to school next year, period.

683
01:17:55,726 --> 01:17:58,107
Would you like to call the roll or should I ask my other questions?

684
01:17:59,808 --> 01:18:08,092
I just wanna, you want that to, I just don't know what the admin will put in the budget if they don't need to give us that plan until August 1st.

685
01:18:08,132 --> 01:18:12,234
So I just wanna make sure it's clear to the administration and the finance team.

686
01:18:14,075 --> 01:18:19,597
I'm gonna assume that the finance team can figure that out between now and the time the final budget is presented to us.

687
01:18:19,617 --> 01:18:21,498
Well, I think the only thing I would say, Merrick,

688
01:18:21,925 --> 01:18:33,773
is that I take the motion to mean that we don't want any students to be dependent upon a MBTA pass that they have to purchase with their own money to get to school.

689
01:18:34,253 --> 01:18:39,136
Now, I think that there are different ways that we can explore that.

690
01:18:39,156 --> 01:18:44,199
I think the most cost effective way is going to be with an additional, at least one additional yellow bus.

691
01:18:45,240 --> 01:18:47,301
And as I said, that could come at no cost.

692
01:18:47,341 --> 01:18:48,922
That could be budget neutral theoretically.

693
01:18:50,416 --> 01:19:00,900
I think that beyond that, one, it could be more than one yellow bus, and then there could be anything beyond one bus is certainly gonna have a budget impact of some kind.

694
01:19:01,581 --> 01:19:07,383
And then I think the other issue that we have to deal with is that there are going to be students who want the discounted MBTA pass.

695
01:19:07,743 --> 01:19:19,248
I don't take the motion to suggest that we should discontinue our partnership with MBTA and no longer offer the MBTA passes because if there's students who want to buy the pass for whatever reason,

696
01:19:19,732 --> 01:19:24,975
We certainly want our students to be able to get a discounted pass the way students in other school districts can.

697
01:19:24,995 --> 01:19:35,141
So I think we would continue the program, but I think we will just need to scrutinize essentially what the usage of the pass is amongst students.

698
01:19:35,622 --> 01:19:44,807
And then if they are dependent upon that, we need to either cover the cost of the MBTA pass or create an alternative option for students to get to school.

699
01:19:45,247 --> 01:19:46,308
Now, I think

700
01:19:46,792 --> 01:19:53,614
what that comes down to is how many of the passes are we selling and how many of the students that are buying the passes are dependent upon them.

701
01:19:54,174 --> 01:19:56,754
And then where would the routing be of a yellow bus?

702
01:19:56,794 --> 01:20:02,436
So there are certainly layers for that, but it's certainly clear direction from the committee.

703
01:20:03,836 --> 01:20:10,318
If we run into a problem in terms of executing either from a budgetary perspective or a logistical perspective, we'll come back.

704
01:20:10,798 --> 01:20:15,679
It is conceivable to me that there could be a constituency of students

705
01:20:17,575 --> 01:20:23,517
when we say like, well, you're buying this pass because you need it to get to school, because you need to get to work, because you just want a discounted MBTA pass.

706
01:20:24,017 --> 01:20:27,819
And they're going to say like, listen, buddy, I just want the pass.

707
01:20:27,959 --> 01:20:29,439
Here's my 30 bucks.

708
01:20:30,300 --> 01:20:31,740
I'll worry about getting to school.

709
01:20:32,300 --> 01:20:35,561
At that point, I don't think we're violating the policy.

710
01:20:35,581 --> 01:20:44,644
I think we're running into a student who's decided that he or she wants to take the MBTA to school, whether they're on time or not.

711
01:20:46,824 --> 01:20:50,147
Again, I think that the intent is very, very clear.

712
01:20:50,167 --> 01:20:53,930
And I think we will do everything we can to execute on that.

713
01:20:54,731 --> 01:21:04,740
We'll just have to keep an open dialogue with the committee if we're running into a situation in which it's proving either from a budgetary perspective or just on the execution level, it's just not possible.

714
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:08,944
But I certainly understand the intent.

715
01:21:09,084 --> 01:21:12,607
And like I said, we'll do our best to act in a manner consistent with it.

716
01:21:19,947 --> 01:21:22,369
So how do you want the resolution to be worded?

717
01:21:23,149 --> 01:21:31,956
Member Graham and Mr. Murphy, so we can have an idea of what we're looking at by June 1st rather than August 1st.

718
01:21:35,198 --> 01:21:37,360
I thought it was clear.

719
01:21:38,481 --> 01:21:44,025
Well, you mentioned the August 1st date, which I just wanna be able to know what I'm supporting and what will be provided when.

720
01:21:45,178 --> 01:21:50,139
So the budget will include an assumption that it does not cost money to get to school.

721
01:21:51,620 --> 01:21:59,541
And the revised transportation plan and strategy is not something that can reasonably be done before that happens.

722
01:21:59,621 --> 01:22:02,602
So that is what would take until August 1st.

723
01:22:02,662 --> 01:22:13,785
Like the details of, is it that the MBTA passes are just free for everybody or is it the strategy that there is a yellow bus and is the strategy that we're changing

724
01:22:14,485 --> 01:22:23,669
radius from one mile to two miles, all of that obviously has budget implications as does literally everything that happens in the district after we pass the budget.

725
01:22:25,430 --> 01:22:33,814
But the budget needs to reflect a cost capacity that allows us to not require students to pay to come to school.

726
01:22:38,496 --> 01:22:39,457
Is that clear, Mr. Murphy?

727
01:22:40,204 --> 01:22:50,352
Yeah, I mean, I guess the only caveat, I'm really not trying to be nitpicky about this, is that I don't think at the moment we require anyone to pay money to come to school.

728
01:22:50,733 --> 01:23:07,827
In reality, some students are taking the MBTA bus, and theoretically our lack of yellow bus capacity at the high school is necessitating that based on where they live or based on the family situation or whatever.

729
01:23:08,364 --> 01:23:18,010
And so in practice where they are paying to get to school, but it's not like it's the district policy that says like, we don't let you in unless you show up on an MBTA bus that you pay for.

730
01:23:18,090 --> 01:23:36,322
So we can, I think one, I think we would wanna collect data from the current population of students, hopefully look back over a period of years as well, see how many MBTA passes we're selling, assume that that's a ceiling in terms of what we would have to provide

731
01:23:38,495 --> 01:23:47,017
And then I think we look at to see if, do we, do we reduce that from a cost perspective by adding yellow bus capacity?

732
01:23:47,658 --> 01:23:56,520
And then I think as we sell the MBTA passes, because as we discussed earlier, we don't want to actually preclude our students from getting the discounted passes.

733
01:23:56,960 --> 01:23:59,601
Then I think we have to collect the data as to what the passes are.

734
01:24:00,021 --> 01:24:06,963
Are the passes being used based on a preference or being purchased rather based on the preference or based on a lack of

735
01:24:07,609 --> 01:24:09,090
other ways to get to school.

736
01:24:09,691 --> 01:24:13,194
So I think the intent is very clear.

737
01:24:13,214 --> 01:24:24,503
Like I said, we'll execute in line with it and we'll just have to come back if we're running into a logistical hurdle or if it becomes something seems impossible about it.

738
01:24:26,605 --> 01:24:28,667
Member McLaughlin, on this motion.

739
01:24:28,707 --> 01:24:31,389
On this motion, thank you.

740
01:24:31,830 --> 01:24:33,091
I just, for clarification,

741
01:24:34,285 --> 01:24:51,162
perspective, I would like to just, I guess, sort of point of clarification if there's such a thing but the issue has the long standing issue has been that we are having students who are paying to support to school, many of whom are economically disadvantaged, and who are

742
01:24:52,443 --> 01:24:55,885
potentially over a two mile radius, or at least at a two mile radius.

743
01:24:55,925 --> 01:25:16,377
And if you think about even the cusp of the two mile radius, which would be, say, for example, students in the, you know, McGlynn vicinity, McGlynn Middle School vicinity, walking to the high school or to have it because they couldn't afford or having to choose to, you know, pay $30 a month for the reduced pass that could very much impact their families.

744
01:25:16,417 --> 01:25:17,038
I think it's just,

745
01:25:17,718 --> 01:25:33,767
an ethics value it's a statement it's a it's a our budget does reflect what our values are and I think I have been stunned that that has been the case in the history even sitting in school committee on the other side of the podium that that students were having to pay.

746
01:25:34,447 --> 01:25:54,745
to transport themselves to school and especially having been a student myself who would not have been able to do that and so then you think about what the absentee rates are what the hunger rates are what you know just so many there's so many impacts so to that motion I would you know I would prefer that it's the MBTA passes but I would defer to the finance committee to do it to provide us a

747
01:25:55,565 --> 01:26:04,267
cost benefit analysis that we can look at a little bit more even, you know, in the next session or in the final session as we're evaluating this.

748
01:26:04,307 --> 01:26:08,107
But I would like to move the question and I second member Graham's motion.

749
01:26:09,127 --> 01:26:10,848
To review on June 1st.

750
01:26:11,528 --> 01:26:12,828
Yep.

751
01:26:13,828 --> 01:26:16,649
No child needs to pay for their own busing.

752
01:26:16,669 --> 01:26:20,109
If you could call the roll, member McLaughlin.

753
01:26:22,030 --> 01:26:22,330
Yes.

754
01:26:22,990 --> 01:26:23,610
Member Graham?

755
01:26:24,070 --> 01:26:24,270
Yes.

756
01:26:25,906 --> 01:26:26,827
Member Kretz?

757
01:26:27,407 --> 01:26:27,647
Yes.

758
01:26:28,788 --> 01:26:29,688
Member McLaughlin?

759
01:26:29,708 --> 01:26:30,048
Yes.

760
01:26:30,309 --> 01:26:31,069
Member McStone?

761
01:26:31,429 --> 01:26:31,689
Yes.

762
01:26:32,950 --> 01:26:33,710
Member Rousseau?

763
01:26:35,111 --> 01:26:35,311
Yes.

764
01:26:37,553 --> 01:26:38,393
Member Van de Kloot?

765
01:26:38,793 --> 01:26:39,033
Yes.

766
01:26:40,154 --> 01:26:40,894
Mayor Longo-Kern?

767
01:26:41,555 --> 01:26:41,775
Yes.

768
01:26:41,815 --> 01:26:43,616
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

769
01:26:43,856 --> 01:26:44,657
Motion passes.

770
01:26:45,937 --> 01:26:48,759
I apologize, and I couldn't get this.

771
01:26:48,939 --> 01:26:53,321
I should have gotten this question out before the question was moved, but I just want to ask one more clarifying question.

772
01:26:55,707 --> 01:27:11,460
If there's the motion contemplate the two mile radius at the secondary level, because the, in, in the, under the existing policy, the, those students wouldn't be provided a yellow bus, even if we had unloaded yellow buses.

773
01:27:12,541 --> 01:27:23,790
But I, I don't, I don't know what an MBTA pass would do, but if a student lives a quarter mile from the school is the expectation that we would still ensure that there's free transportation for that student, even though

774
01:27:24,520 --> 01:27:27,501
sort of under the policy contemplates them walking to school?

775
01:27:28,902 --> 01:27:38,606
No, I mean, if the law contemplates students walking to school, I'm fine with that continuing to be the practice.

776
01:27:38,646 --> 01:27:45,630
I'm not asking for us to bite off that piece of the apple personally, right now.

777
01:27:47,542 --> 01:27:52,864
I am concerned about the people who are in excess of two miles from the school, who have to pay to get to school.

778
01:27:53,365 --> 01:28:06,870
If you're, if you're beyond two miles from school and on either sides of the, you know, outside of the radius of the high school, and one is beginning a free yellow bus, and one is being told, you've got to pay $30 a month for an MBTA pass.

779
01:28:07,871 --> 01:28:08,531
That's outrageous.

780
01:28:08,911 --> 01:28:09,131
Yes.

781
01:28:09,571 --> 01:28:13,673
And so if that's what we're looking to address, I think that that is sensible.

782
01:28:13,693 --> 01:28:14,733
It's something that we can look at.

783
01:28:15,494 --> 01:28:16,174
The law,

784
01:28:16,745 --> 01:28:22,508
just to be clear, is no one over sixth grade is entitled to transportation.

785
01:28:22,728 --> 01:28:32,512
And so the law is in effect to put up the existing policy with a two mile radius, which is almost uniform across the Commonwealth.

786
01:28:32,932 --> 01:28:35,294
That makes sense and that we can do.

787
01:28:36,074 --> 01:28:42,557
But as long as we're, your response tells me that we all agree what the inequity is, that's what we're looking to address.

788
01:28:43,073 --> 01:28:46,354
and we'll come up with a plan consistent with the vote to do that.

789
01:28:46,754 --> 01:28:55,458
Can I make a point about information, because I'm not sure that we're clear on what, at least on what I felt like was being discussed as well, and I want clarity.

790
01:28:55,618 --> 01:28:56,438
Mayor, may I do that?

791
01:28:56,458 --> 01:29:01,100
Clear information, Member McLaughlin.

792
01:29:01,680 --> 01:29:01,980
Thank you.

793
01:29:03,480 --> 01:29:10,323
I think that my issue specifically was around economically disadvantaged students having to pay

794
01:29:11,594 --> 01:29:12,815
transportation to school.

795
01:29:13,635 --> 01:29:24,499
And so, whether that is within the two mile radius or, or, you know, I guess the two mile radius is, you know, or one mile radius or what have you that we're offering.

796
01:29:25,059 --> 01:29:29,901
I know in the past teachers have been paying for students to have access to MBTA.

797
01:29:30,261 --> 01:29:31,442
transportation passes.

798
01:29:31,843 --> 01:29:51,444
And so to your point Mr. Murphy and this is something that can be for further consideration not necessarily for this particular motion or addition you know the motions have been passed but to your point that this allows MBTA passes allow for accessibility in the city, they can allow for the classroom in the city, they can allow for job opportunities,

799
01:29:51,804 --> 01:29:53,465
they can allow for transportation to school.

800
01:29:53,886 --> 01:29:58,669
And my biggest subset that I'm concerned with- Are you going to ask a question?

801
01:29:58,689 --> 01:29:59,229
Yeah.

802
01:29:59,409 --> 01:30:05,354
Are we focused on the economically disadvantaged in this consideration?

803
01:30:05,854 --> 01:30:08,056
Well, I think the motion has- I think it's everybody.

804
01:30:08,076 --> 01:30:10,057
Yeah, I think it's everybody.

805
01:30:10,517 --> 01:30:16,922
Yes, it's broader than economically disadvantaged, but it is not inclusive of students within the two mile radius.

806
01:30:17,402 --> 01:30:20,524
So that gives us a data point to start from and

807
01:30:22,335 --> 01:30:34,363
similar to what Dr. Grisham was saying earlier about using the GPS to identify sort of from a data plots perspective, data plotting, you know, we can say, okay, this is our population of students that we've got to make sure that we get to school for free.

808
01:30:34,903 --> 01:30:44,489
And it might be the case that similar to apparently what we do before Labor Day, if we just put a bus in the room, we're able to accommodate a large portion of those students.

809
01:30:45,009 --> 01:30:51,453
And so if we're able to do that, then I think this could prove to be a fairly simple directive to fulfill.

810
01:30:51,971 --> 01:30:56,994
If we look at it and say, well, that one bus that we used before Labor Day only takes care of 15% of the students.

811
01:30:57,074 --> 01:31:02,118
And in order to address the various areas of the community, we need six new buses.

812
01:31:02,598 --> 01:31:11,764
Then we might have to come back and say, we're going to have to piece this together in some other way because we don't have a sustainable way of doing it right now.

813
01:31:12,545 --> 01:31:19,830
And then at that point, we may have to pare down who we are focusing on to economically disadvantages for the reason that Ms.

814
01:31:19,850 --> 01:31:20,370
McLaughlin was saying.

815
01:31:21,003 --> 01:31:28,606
So again, I don't exactly know how this is gonna turn out, but I think we have clear direction and we're happy to move forward with it.

816
01:31:30,787 --> 01:31:31,127
Thank you.

817
01:31:31,527 --> 01:31:34,589
Member Graham, and then it's member McLaughlin.

818
01:31:36,129 --> 01:31:37,690
Then member Russo, then member Kratz.

819
01:31:39,150 --> 01:31:39,511
Thank you.

820
01:31:39,531 --> 01:31:50,395
I was a little surprised not to see changes or position recommendations in the finance office because it's my sense that

821
01:31:52,955 --> 01:31:58,459
there's always been too much work to do in that office for the number of staff that are there.

822
01:31:59,059 --> 01:31:59,459
What's that?

823
01:31:59,740 --> 01:32:02,522
I said, that's my impression as well, but that's not here.

824
01:32:03,442 --> 01:32:05,684
And so, but there's no ask here to address that.

825
01:32:05,744 --> 01:32:06,264
Why is that?

826
01:32:07,325 --> 01:32:18,892
Because in the committee will remember that what was advocated for going into FY21 was essentially a two position capacity.

827
01:32:20,177 --> 01:32:30,283
What we looked at to do that in order to fulfill that was, one, with the Chapter 70 allocation, we added the position of comptroller.

828
01:32:30,703 --> 01:32:31,403
That's Ms.

829
01:32:31,443 --> 01:32:40,268
Kingdon, who has been instrumental in me looking less foolish than I would on a normal basis week in and week out.

830
01:32:41,048 --> 01:32:46,071
Also brings accounting capacity and expertise that they didn't cover in law school, which I'm grateful for.

831
01:32:46,652 --> 01:32:47,412
In addition to that,

832
01:32:48,099 --> 01:33:01,166
we repurposed an executive assistant position that had evolved into a grant coordinator role and repositioned that into the finance office as a grant coordinator.

833
01:33:01,506 --> 01:33:03,748
And so we've expanded our capacity to that extent.

834
01:33:04,608 --> 01:33:15,414
You'll see that it's a, well, on your salary tables, the executive assistant, the backfilling of the executive assistant position, and just, I'm sorry, just to finish that,

835
01:33:15,982 --> 01:33:18,403
All of that was done in the course of FY21.

836
01:33:18,903 --> 01:33:24,965
Budget neutral on the grant coordinator in this came in again through the chapter 70 allocation that was made in August.

837
01:33:25,485 --> 01:33:31,167
So that expanded our capacity and has positioned us better to be able to serve the district.

838
01:33:32,747 --> 01:33:40,390
The one priority that's remaining in the finance and operations budget narrative lives in the salary tables

839
01:33:40,948 --> 01:34:05,247
that are district wide, which I should speak to before we, just to be clear as to what the district wide salary table is, that executive assistant position that currently supports two of the assistant superintendents when it's backfilled will support all three of the assistant superintendents and therefore be adding capacity to the finance office in that respect as well.

840
01:34:05,327 --> 01:34:08,630
So in effect, we will have,

841
01:34:09,729 --> 01:34:12,230
Again, we're not looking to balloon the finance office.

842
01:34:12,250 --> 01:34:22,095
You heard me say last night that the budget priorities that have developed as part of the applied 22 budget are driven by what is going to have the most direct support for students.

843
01:34:22,235 --> 01:34:30,299
And I can certainly understand how those working in school communities would suggest that the finance and operations office is not necessarily the one that's the closest to kids.

844
01:34:31,299 --> 01:34:36,382
But in order for us to serve the district well and to benefit kids, we need to have adequate staffing

845
01:34:37,116 --> 01:34:44,819
by adding the grant coordinator position, the comptroller position, and a portion of the executive assistant position, we feel that we'll be better positioned to do that.

846
01:34:47,179 --> 01:34:47,780
Thank you for that.

847
01:34:48,700 --> 01:34:54,082
And then my final comment is just to say that I am not in favor of spending

848
01:34:56,835 --> 01:35:09,324
capital funds on restroom rehab projects or the Karen Theater or the entrance until there is an actual master plan that addresses the long-term needs of the high school.

849
01:35:10,946 --> 01:35:11,846
It's a lot of money.

850
01:35:11,866 --> 01:35:19,892
It's like a quarter of a million dollars all in, and it's just, it's not inconsequential when we are talking,

851
01:35:20,885 --> 01:35:28,770
like 10 power professionals, many, many teachers, staff that we can't fit into the budget.

852
01:35:29,010 --> 01:35:37,455
There's a lot of other priorities than to spend without having a clear plan for the building.

853
01:35:39,548 --> 01:35:46,234
have said this before, but the priority of having a clear plan for that building is critically important.

854
01:35:47,475 --> 01:36:03,550
And until that happens, I can't support spending the community's dollars in a way that's going to pigeonhole us or tie our hands when it comes to the greater needs of that building, which are as yet unassessed.

855
01:36:04,711 --> 01:36:04,971
Thank you.

856
01:36:08,462 --> 01:36:18,108
Just to that point, if I could point out the 800 plus thousand and the 100,000 from the boiler and the science labs has to go to capital projects.

857
01:36:18,188 --> 01:36:20,290
So I just think that- I think there are plenty.

858
01:36:22,011 --> 01:36:29,115
And the high school needs a lot of attention and a vision committee and work that we would do through that will be years away.

859
01:36:29,215 --> 01:36:31,076
So, I mean, I just respectfully disagree.

860
01:36:31,096 --> 01:36:32,057
I wanted to point that out.

861
01:36:32,837 --> 01:36:33,638
Member McLaughlin.

862
01:36:36,765 --> 01:36:37,105
Thank you.

863
01:36:37,125 --> 01:36:37,945
I have a few questions.

864
01:36:38,045 --> 01:36:41,127
I guess I'll start with that one since that was the last topic of the conversation.

865
01:36:42,267 --> 01:36:51,050
I guess I'd like on the next agenda for the MHS vision committee to be included so we can understand what the status of that is as we're considering spending money.

866
01:36:51,070 --> 01:36:54,392
I just don't want to throw, you know, good money after bad.

867
01:36:56,687 --> 01:37:00,590
There's been so much discussion about the high school and we haven't convened the vision committee.

868
01:37:00,630 --> 01:37:04,953
So I'd like that if we can have that included on the next agenda, please.

869
01:37:06,374 --> 01:37:18,261
And then going back to the transportation, did the chair, I was gonna ask Mr. Murphy, what you meant by tying programmatic opportunities to their procurement?

870
01:37:20,763 --> 01:37:23,105
Is that in the, that's in one of the documents.

871
01:37:24,065 --> 01:37:26,267
The procurement of what is just a little more context.

872
01:37:27,308 --> 01:37:28,949
I don't know, I didn't understand what you were talking about.

873
01:37:28,969 --> 01:37:34,831
You were talking about transportation and I'm sorry, but I quoted what you were saying.

874
01:37:34,951 --> 01:37:37,272
I'm sorry, I think we were talking about the MBTA passes.

875
01:37:37,612 --> 01:37:37,872
Yeah.

876
01:37:38,012 --> 01:37:42,434
And what I was saying, and I think you made a similar comment, Ms.

877
01:37:42,454 --> 01:37:47,635
McLaughlin, that the MBTA passes are a good investment to get students to school.

878
01:37:47,936 --> 01:37:53,878
They're a great investment if there's a nexus between the procurement of the MBTA passes

879
01:37:54,978 --> 01:38:00,583
programmatic and instructional opportunities that put students out in the community and give them experiential learning opportunities.

880
01:38:01,083 --> 01:38:20,300
And because I don't know that, and certainly there are plenty of teachers and CCR, CCSR is a great example of it, but there's plenty of instructional opportunities at the high school that do infiltrate the community and the sort of educational world at large beyond just the walls of the classroom.

881
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:23,122
But if we're going to increase our investment

882
01:38:23,724 --> 01:38:49,939
and invest in MBTA passes, then it would seem to me that we could maximize that investment if we're doing it and thinking through an instructional lens as well, and trying to expand our experiential learning opportunities, which is, I think in my view, at least is a good unto itself, but it's magnified when we're also providing that type of resource to make it more accessible for students.

883
01:38:51,149 --> 01:38:51,509
Thank you.

884
01:38:51,610 --> 01:39:06,276
I thought that's what you meant, and I wanted some clarification because I'm imagining, for example, vocational students transporting to their site, CCSR volunteers, sort of all of those things.

885
01:39:06,316 --> 01:39:15,280
So it would be interesting to know what the programmatic opportunities are as we're considering this cost analysis for these different options.

886
01:39:18,046 --> 01:39:22,248
And then I know that it's not just Eastern bus that we have is our transportation vendors.

887
01:39:22,728 --> 01:39:27,950
We have multiple transportation vendors and there's been multiple issues across the transportation vendors.

888
01:39:29,571 --> 01:39:38,835
We've personally been experiencing some issues with transportation vendors and I know that it's difficult to maintain or retain staff.

889
01:39:39,275 --> 01:39:40,876
especially under the current circumstances.

890
01:39:41,596 --> 01:40:02,648
But I'm wondering about a centralized opportunity or almost like a C-click fix, you know, sort of, or option or, you know, complaint line or something where we can collect data on what is actually happening in the community for our transportation, because we are paying a lot of money to our vendors, and I feel like there's no accountability to the vendors.

891
01:40:02,728 --> 01:40:07,791
There's no sort of consistency around what the vendors are providing, and even in some of the contracts I've seen

892
01:40:08,351 --> 01:40:17,973
Letters come home to parents saying that if you miss the bus in the morning, you're not going to get picked up in the afternoon, which is a complete violation, right?

893
01:40:18,013 --> 01:40:18,733
You can't do that.

894
01:40:19,574 --> 01:40:23,655
But this is for special education transportation, for example.

895
01:40:24,075 --> 01:40:26,755
But that was a letter that we specifically saw.

896
01:40:27,195 --> 01:40:28,796
So this is what I'm saying.

897
01:40:28,816 --> 01:40:33,777
There has to be some consistency around the contracts, around the budgets, but also around the sort of complaint process.

898
01:40:33,817 --> 01:40:34,177
Because if

899
01:40:35,017 --> 01:40:48,863
one administrator's hearing complaints on one section of it and another's hearing another, like who's centralizing these complaints for us to understand as a school committee what the bids are on these vendors and whether they're reasonable.

900
01:40:50,083 --> 01:40:51,944
No, I appreciate you raising that, Ms.

901
01:40:51,964 --> 01:41:04,269
McLaughlin, and I, as I said at the beginning of the presentation, this is one of the key reasons that we've wanted to reorganize around having a family-engaged point person.

902
01:41:04,747 --> 01:41:23,556
And that's not to say that once we have a director of family engagement, you know, there'll never be any complaints or there'll never be any complaints that don't have the immediate and substantive response that we would prefer because the nature of a large organization is sometimes there's going to be something's going to happen and we don't actually hear about it until sometime later.

903
01:41:23,636 --> 01:41:27,618
And sometimes we're going to hear about it, but there's going to be a conflicting

904
01:41:28,102 --> 01:41:30,124
you know, story as to what actually occurred.

905
01:41:30,164 --> 01:41:40,232
So I don't want to suggest that through that reorganizing of those offices, somehow there will never be any additional problems, because, you know, that's reality.

906
01:41:40,272 --> 01:41:57,786
At the same time, though, we envision the Family Engagement Office serving in many ways as the central facilitator amongst the offices that have the most direct contact and most frequent contact

907
01:41:58,207 --> 01:42:25,603
with families, and that's some of the before and after school care programs, the registration process when you're first coming into the school community, health services, where oftentimes the communication with families is literally life-dependent, and special education certainly, and transportation is a big part of that, because as much as we interact with families and parents in the instructional realm,

908
01:42:26,050 --> 01:42:49,543
some of those basic operational logistical issues are the ones that families are most dependent on the district for, and having those offices sort of being the spokes of a wheel, if you will, I think will help from a communication perspective and making sure that the administrators who need to be informed about some of these issues are informed rapidly.

909
01:42:49,603 --> 01:42:55,546
So the only point at which I would differ with regard to your comments, Member McLaughlin,

910
01:42:55,993 --> 01:42:59,554
is that the suggestion that there would be no accountability for any vendors.

911
01:43:00,215 --> 01:43:07,418
And accountability can manifest itself in a variety of ways and sometimes on a variety of timelines.

912
01:43:08,358 --> 01:43:14,921
But I will say that whenever the administration and certainly Ms.

913
01:43:14,941 --> 01:43:24,605
Bowen's office in particular hears of these issues, we take them very seriously and we are responsive to it.

914
01:43:25,885 --> 01:43:41,056
And if there are any instances in which parents or caregivers are aware of, in which a vendor has not fulfilled their responsibilities to students in the district or the families in the district, it's something we wanna know about that right away.

915
01:43:41,877 --> 01:43:53,786
And we certainly have our commitment that there will be a robust response at all times because certainly the situation that you described, you know, evacuate is completely unacceptable and it's not something we would tolerate.

916
01:43:54,908 --> 01:43:57,209
by our own staff or any vendors that we partner with.

917
01:43:58,190 --> 01:43:58,570
Thank you.

918
01:43:58,650 --> 01:44:08,374
And just if I may, Mayor, to be clear, the Director of Pupil Services has always been incredibly responsive, but I have also always been a squeaky wheel.

919
01:44:08,494 --> 01:44:17,799
And I think about the folks who aren't and how they're being responded to and how they're able to sort of demonstrate that the transportation is working.

920
01:44:17,859 --> 01:44:19,900
And I think it's around data collection, frankly.

921
01:44:20,460 --> 01:44:23,501
and children coming to school late and sort of what that looks like.

922
01:44:23,541 --> 01:44:25,701
But again, looking at our vendors I think is important.

923
01:44:25,721 --> 01:44:42,084
And then lastly, I just wanted to again also laud the superintendent's direction towards more professional development and targeted professional development, both around implicit bias and social emotional learning.

924
01:44:42,164 --> 01:44:48,865
And I have heard from staff and community members two points on the professional development that I wanted to sort of raise.

925
01:44:48,925 --> 01:44:49,685
And one is that

926
01:44:51,006 --> 01:45:07,397
Some of the specialized staff I think is not necessarily feeling as though that there is targeted professional development for, you know, very specific licensing or needs and so I wanted to sort of present that and then also

927
01:45:07,937 --> 01:45:28,465
you know just concern about ensuring paraprofessional participation and professional development and or that is that is related to paraprofessional and certainly it sounds like the social emotional learning piece will be part of that but I want to ensure that and I know in the past I think that they a lot of times the paraprofessionals have gone where the teachers go.

928
01:45:30,366 --> 01:45:34,250
they're they're partner teachers, which I understand, you know the reasoning around that, too.

929
01:45:34,270 --> 01:45:39,994
But I think it would be also nice just to be able to let people have some flexibility and choice for the professional development.

930
01:45:40,054 --> 01:45:46,600
So those are not things that I expect any answer to tonight, but I just sort of wanted to bring that up so that you guys are aware.

931
01:45:46,620 --> 01:45:47,020
Thank you.

932
01:45:47,040 --> 01:45:47,901
Thank you.

933
01:45:48,441 --> 01:45:49,703
Thank you, members.

934
01:45:50,003 --> 01:45:51,964
So member Kratz and then member Van de Kloet.

935
01:45:53,346 --> 01:45:53,866
Thank you, Mayor.

936
01:45:55,482 --> 01:46:01,045
I know that we've already passed the resolution on the transportation plan.

937
01:46:01,065 --> 01:46:06,508
I had to walk 1.1 miles to the bus stop every day growing up.

938
01:46:07,228 --> 01:46:13,471
And if I missed the bus, it was a four hour and 29 minute walk to get to school.

939
01:46:15,172 --> 01:46:17,193
Obviously that's a little bigger than Medford.

940
01:46:17,453 --> 01:46:18,794
So it was 13 miles.

941
01:46:19,594 --> 01:46:24,957
But my point is my experience of making it to the bus or not going to school,

942
01:46:26,247 --> 01:46:34,071
Um, was that if you looked at my absences, um, you know, Massachusetts, I'd probably have DCF at my house, frankly.

943
01:46:34,852 --> 01:46:49,980
Um, so I, I just hope that when we do the plan, um, and we are talking about two miles versus one mile, um, I, I think, uh, this ties in a bit to Mr. Murphy's staffing levels.

944
01:46:50,600 --> 01:46:55,683
Um, I want to know our kids that are within the two mile radius.

945
01:46:56,303 --> 01:46:59,705
tardy or absent more than kids that are outside of the two mile radius.

946
01:46:59,885 --> 01:47:13,531
And I don't actually think you have the capacity to go through a year's worth of parties and a year's worth of absences and figure out distance from the school and whether they use the busing or like that seems that's a heavy lift.

947
01:47:14,831 --> 01:47:20,274
But that's a policy decision we are making with no idea of the impact on

948
01:47:21,397 --> 01:47:28,242
the educational outcomes because, you know, if we always go back to that, if you're not in school, you certainly aren't learning.

949
01:47:29,023 --> 01:47:39,471
So I just, you know, my own experience of you make it to the bus stop or you don't go to school, that surely happens in Medford too.

950
01:47:40,311 --> 01:47:46,376
So when we talk about one mile versus two mile, I think we have to also recognize there isn't just a financial impact.

951
01:47:46,996 --> 01:47:48,678
There's an impact on all the scores

952
01:47:49,816 --> 01:47:57,202
the superintendent really likes her MCAS score, you know, they're metrics, whether she likes MCAS or not, they're metrics and that's important.

953
01:47:58,783 --> 01:48:04,788
But this is a specific policy that will have impact on metrics.

954
01:48:05,089 --> 01:48:11,234
And I'm not, I mean, I don't, I'm not asking for a report, but I know from my own experience that it's absolutely a fact.

955
01:48:11,734 --> 01:48:14,096
If you miss the bus, you don't go to school.

956
01:48:14,156 --> 01:48:19,040
And granted, I couldn't walk to school if I missed the bus and didn't have transportation otherwise, but

957
01:48:19,784 --> 01:48:24,127
I'm sure there are plenty of kids who, if they missed the bus, screw it.

958
01:48:27,149 --> 01:48:30,391
But for all the kids under that two mile radius, there is no bus.

959
01:48:31,051 --> 01:48:44,100
So when it's bitter, nasty, cold rain, which we used to get before global warming made everything 70 degrees, those days, if you're getting to the bus,

960
01:48:49,105 --> 01:48:54,769
different than if you're not getting to the bus and you're expected to walk at least 40 minutes to get to school.

961
01:48:55,409 --> 01:48:57,571
So I don't have a question.

962
01:48:57,591 --> 01:49:00,753
I'm just kind of... Thank you, members.

963
01:49:00,773 --> 01:49:01,113
Thank you.

964
01:49:02,094 --> 01:49:04,115
Member Kratz and then member Van de Kloet.

965
01:49:08,779 --> 01:49:10,560
Member Kratz, if you could just unmute yourself, please.

966
01:49:14,746 --> 01:49:16,126
Oh, okay, there we go.

967
01:49:16,227 --> 01:49:40,555
Yes, so in regards to the motion that we made this evening, will that be for, Mr. Murphy's going to get us a report that will outline what the various costs would be, like whether or not we're gonna go with yellow buses for all the students in the district, or we're gonna consider purchasing MBTA bus passes for all the students?

968
01:49:41,671 --> 01:49:53,077
Is that the way, is this going to be a proposal that's gonna be ready for us to review at the time of the budget and we can see how it fits into the budget?

969
01:49:55,799 --> 01:50:10,827
I think we're gonna try to build a plan that does not include students being dependent upon, students who are outside of two mile radius from the high school being dependent upon MBTA passes that they have to purchase.

970
01:50:11,473 --> 01:50:30,116
How we're going to accomplish that, I think we're gonna need a little bit of time to figure out, but I just say, I shouldn't really speculate about this, but I'll just tell you what my gut tells me is that it's gonna have to be a multi-faceted plan in which we are adding yellow bus capacity.

971
01:50:30,776 --> 01:50:40,538
We are having X number of MBTA passes for whom the district is absorbing the cost and potentially exploring

972
01:50:41,690 --> 01:50:58,736
other partnerships to help defray that cost overall, and also being mindful of what data we can collect to determine the basis for the MBTA procurement on the part of students.

973
01:50:58,916 --> 01:51:04,658
So my guess is in order to do this, we'll have to look at sort of each of those levers.

974
01:51:05,398 --> 01:51:09,640
And I think my understanding, I think if we know by August 1st that

975
01:51:10,073 --> 01:51:15,996
this is not something that we can do from either financial perspective or logistical perspective, we'll report back to the committee.

976
01:51:16,016 --> 01:51:21,939
And I would, what I would envision is reporting back to the committee, not just sort of throwing up our hands and saying, sorry, we can't do it.

977
01:51:21,959 --> 01:51:37,848
I think what we would say is, you know, before we had X number of MBTA passes that were being purchased for purposes of getting to school under this plan, we've been able to reduce the number of passes that we anticipate procuring for school by this amount.

978
01:51:38,380 --> 01:51:44,981
here are the obstacles toward eliminating the full boat of students buying the passes.

979
01:51:45,421 --> 01:51:46,902
And then at that point, to Ms.

980
01:51:46,922 --> 01:51:55,023
McLaughlin's point, we could then look at how potentially we target students from economically disadvantaged circumstances.

981
01:51:55,543 --> 01:52:04,485
So I think it's multifaceted, but like I said, the direction is clear and we'll just have to move in that direction and we'll do our best to make it a reality.

982
01:52:05,725 --> 01:52:06,025
Thank you.

983
01:52:07,523 --> 01:52:07,803
Thank you.

984
01:52:07,863 --> 01:52:08,644
Member Van de Kloot.

985
01:52:10,945 --> 01:52:11,345
Thank you.

986
01:52:11,865 --> 01:52:20,730
I just want to go back and address the subject that was raised by Member Graham, followed up with the mayor's comments and Melanie McLaughlin's on the high school.

987
01:52:22,534 --> 01:52:41,287
Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-K

988
01:52:42,366 --> 01:52:50,602
Initially, right after the election and the concerns around the makeup of the committee, then the pandemic stepped in.

989
01:52:53,573 --> 01:52:57,578
It is vital that we determine where we're going to go with this.

990
01:52:57,638 --> 01:52:58,959
Are we going to pick a whole new committee?

991
01:52:58,979 --> 01:53:00,761
There were people who had expressed interest.

992
01:53:02,283 --> 01:53:08,530
At this point, we need to establish a committee because I understand Jenny's concerns.

993
01:53:08,590 --> 01:53:13,135
And I also want to make sure that the building is livable for the kids who are there.

994
01:53:13,336 --> 01:53:14,077
So I think there is a

995
01:53:14,931 --> 01:53:24,434
I think there is some place in the middle of between absolutely not and doing some of the necessary upgrades to keep the building in a satisfactory.

996
01:53:25,828 --> 01:53:28,709
shape while students are currently using it.

997
01:53:29,269 --> 01:53:41,572
But key to that more than anything is we have to determine what the vision committee is going to be, what we're asking them of, and what the timeline we envision is.

998
01:53:41,632 --> 01:53:43,792
Maybe it's not the time to start it at the end of June.

999
01:53:43,872 --> 01:53:44,713
I understand that.

1000
01:53:45,493 --> 01:53:51,494
But we need to be ready to be focused at the beginning of September and not wait for another school year to go by.

1001
01:53:55,327 --> 01:54:02,153
assume the same thing, start it right up in the fall, where we have a number of other things, budget, Columbus School, getting the kids back.

1002
01:54:02,173 --> 01:54:09,679
Yeah, but I think we need to determine, Mayor, we don't need, we can't wait till September to have the discussion about what we're gonna do.

1003
01:54:10,019 --> 01:54:12,801
No, no, June, right.

1004
01:54:12,821 --> 01:54:17,525
I think Member McLaughlin mentioned the next meeting, or I'm assuming one of the June meetings.

1005
01:54:19,967 --> 01:54:21,869
Member, anything else, Member Van de Kloet?

1006
01:54:22,049 --> 01:54:22,770
No, thank you.

1007
01:54:23,270 --> 01:54:24,391
Member Graham, and then we'll,

1008
01:54:25,148 --> 01:54:27,249
I saw the superintendent's hand waving.

1009
01:54:28,149 --> 01:54:29,449
Madam superintendent, the member Graham.

1010
01:54:30,910 --> 01:54:41,993
I just wanted to say that I want to just remind the committee that I believe it was December of 2019 when I did go before the council when the 800,000 was awarded for the bathrooms.

1011
01:54:42,013 --> 01:54:42,713
And I do want to just

1012
01:54:49,813 --> 01:55:01,201
say that I am in strong support of renovating some of the bathrooms at the high school complex because they're in desperate need of just being upgraded and refreshed.

1013
01:55:01,282 --> 01:55:14,772
And I agree that we do need to work on a more comprehensive plan, but the most modern bathrooms in the entire complex are in the science wing.

1014
01:55:15,492 --> 01:55:20,414
And that's for the entire complex that has really modern bathrooms.

1015
01:55:20,954 --> 01:55:24,716
And so not all students are located in that section of the building.

1016
01:55:25,396 --> 01:55:39,803
So I am hoping that some of that money that was earmarked back in 2019 and because of the pandemic and everything that we really do need to go forward with at least renovating and upgrading some of the

1017
01:55:40,923 --> 01:55:42,464
some of those bathroom facilities.

1018
01:55:43,405 --> 01:55:45,106
I think that that's critically important.

1019
01:55:45,446 --> 01:55:59,256
And, you know, I'm just thinking about the needs of the students and saying that I want them to be able to have, you know, updated functioning bathrooms.

1020
01:55:59,817 --> 01:56:06,702
So I just wanted to remind the committee of that commitment that was made when the money was released to us.

1021
01:56:09,628 --> 01:56:10,989
Thank you, Dr. Edward Vincent.

1022
01:56:11,049 --> 01:56:12,429
Member Graham and then member Kratz.

1023
01:56:14,250 --> 01:56:17,651
I just wanted to say that I agree with member Vander Kloot.

1024
01:56:17,711 --> 01:56:37,999
It's not about being opposed to any of those projects, in fact, and perhaps they all make sense, but the absence of information right now is putting us in a position where we could be making decisions to spend substantial amounts of the city's money in a frivolous way or in a way that makes it more complicated to

1025
01:56:39,240 --> 01:56:44,646
do what needs to be done when we actually talk to experts about what the needs are of the building.

1026
01:56:44,766 --> 01:56:58,761
So everyone you talk to has an opinion about what should happen to Medford High School, and I appreciate everybody's input, but there there will be a time and a place for us to consult with experts and outline

1027
01:57:00,703 --> 01:57:04,807
what the experts think needs to happen to the building and that hasn't been done to date.

1028
01:57:04,907 --> 01:57:21,401
So for me I am not opposed to any of these expenditures per se but I am opposed to us deciding that these expenditures are prudent or a good use of taxpayer dollars without experts to tell us that

1029
01:57:23,283 --> 01:57:24,764
that's in fact the case.

1030
01:57:24,784 --> 01:57:30,768
So I do agree that we need to like move along and I think we need to do so with an open mind.

1031
01:57:30,788 --> 01:57:46,257
I remember very distinctly when we walked around the building with the vision committee or the school committee right before the pandemic and I heard from people who had been seated on the committee

1032
01:57:47,278 --> 01:57:59,650
as they talked and shattered in the hallway about what we could or could not possibly consider for the high school because of the science wing or because of the this and because of the that.

1033
01:58:00,191 --> 01:58:02,573
And I would encourage us all to put our opinions

1034
01:58:03,394 --> 01:58:15,683
aside and really come up with a plan that allows us to understand what the building's needs are so that we can move quickly to start to achieve some of those objectives.

1035
01:58:15,783 --> 01:58:23,468
And the final thing I'll say is while we had a conversation about the capital plan, we did not build a capital plan.

1036
01:58:24,308 --> 01:58:31,774
So that $800,000, it's not my impression there's any shortage of projects, including multiple end of life roofs.

1037
01:58:32,454 --> 01:58:40,460
like coming up here very quickly that the comprehensive capital plan didn't account for.

1038
01:58:40,880 --> 01:58:57,713
So I think we have a lot of work to do on our capital plan so that we can be good partners to the rest of city government and help ensure that the needs of our district are met and that we don't run into a situation where we stop maintaining things

1039
01:58:58,970 --> 01:59:05,996
and find ourselves in another like pandemic situation where there's like oodles of work to do to bring buildings back to standard.

1040
01:59:06,076 --> 01:59:12,601
So I'm a complete proponent of us prioritizing that capital plan in a meaningful way.

1041
01:59:13,522 --> 01:59:14,702
I'm not a structural engineer.

1042
01:59:14,763 --> 01:59:16,364
I don't believe anybody on this committee is.

1043
01:59:16,464 --> 01:59:25,851
So I would like us to prioritize that kind of expertise as we talk about plans to spend significant taxpayer dollars, but also,

1044
01:59:27,132 --> 01:59:30,735
I don't believe we have to wait years and years and years for that information.

1045
01:59:30,755 --> 01:59:43,586
I do think the students that go there right now are very important and in fairness to them, and really, frankly, every student that's currently in Medford public schools, the time is now for us to move on this priority.

1046
01:59:45,587 --> 01:59:50,188
my kids likely would not graduate from a high school that looks any different than it does today.

1047
01:59:51,469 --> 01:59:58,490
So if we're lucky, the first graders and the kindergartners might have a shot at something different, but only if we act.

1048
01:59:58,610 --> 02:00:00,251
So it's incumbent on us to do that.

1049
02:00:00,751 --> 02:00:01,111
Thank you.

1050
02:00:03,892 --> 02:00:04,192
Thank you.

1051
02:00:04,232 --> 02:00:04,812
Member Kratz.

1052
02:00:06,003 --> 02:00:28,391
Yes, so I just wanted to comment on everybody's views on the capital fund spending and next week I do have the building and ground subcommittee meeting and several of the capital items that are in the pre-budget this evening are on my agenda for discussion next week.

1053
02:00:28,691 --> 02:00:34,473
And I have communicated with Mr. McLaughlin a few times about getting estimates and

1054
02:00:34,873 --> 02:00:38,115
sharing this information with the committee next week.

1055
02:00:38,615 --> 02:00:48,360
So, you know, I'm just letting everybody know if you're interested, the subcommittee meeting will be May 26 from five to seven.

1056
02:00:48,900 --> 02:00:55,264
There are several different topics that are on the pre-budget agenda this evening that we'll be talking about.

1057
02:00:56,064 --> 02:00:57,665
Just wanted to share that information.

1058
02:01:01,107 --> 02:01:01,987
Thank you, Member Kretz.

1059
02:01:02,047 --> 02:01:03,268
And then I know on June 1st,

1060
02:01:04,866 --> 02:01:07,307
which is a Tuesday.

1061
02:01:07,327 --> 02:01:14,551
We will have our budget hearings at the same time, 7 p.m., June 1st.

1062
02:01:16,332 --> 02:01:18,954
If there's no other questions, is there a motion to adjourn?

1063
02:01:20,455 --> 02:01:21,235
Motion to adjourn.

1064
02:01:21,555 --> 02:01:21,835
Second.

1065
02:01:22,276 --> 02:01:23,777
Seconded by member Kretz, roll call.

1066
02:01:24,997 --> 02:01:25,678
Member Graham.

1067
02:01:26,318 --> 02:01:26,558
Yes.

1068
02:01:28,459 --> 02:01:29,119
Member Kretz.

1069
02:01:29,620 --> 02:01:29,840
Yes.

1070
02:01:30,840 --> 02:01:31,581
Member McLaughlin.

1071
02:01:31,901 --> 02:01:32,281
Yes.

1072
02:01:32,481 --> 02:01:33,462
Member McStone.

1073
02:01:34,870 --> 02:01:35,110
Yes.

1074
02:01:36,272 --> 02:01:36,372
Yes.

1075
02:01:36,392 --> 02:01:36,732
Yes.

1076
02:01:36,752 --> 02:01:36,932
Yes.

1077
02:01:38,294 --> 02:01:38,534
Yes.
