 Buenas noches, alcalde Lungo-Koehn y miembros del comité escolar.
 Esta noche es nuestra quinta reunión para discutir el presupuesto.
 Esta tarde nos centraremos en la oficina central.
 Nuevamente, la oficina del superintendente, operaciones, finanzas, seguridad,
 participación familiar, recursos humanos y edificios y terrenos.
 Entonces, sin mucho más preámbulo, le pasaré el testigo al Sr. Murphy.
 Y solo quiero agradecerle nuevamente a él, a su equipo y a Michelle Kingdon por todo el trabajo que están haciendo durante este proceso presupuestario.
 Gracias, Sr. Murphy.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=208.272s">[David Murphy]</a>:  Thank you, Superintendent, Mayor, members of the school committee.
 It's a pleasure to be with you again this evening.
 for our fifth committee of the whole meeting focused on the FY22 budget.
 As the superintendent mentioned, tonight we'll be focused on elements of the central office, specifically the offices that are under both the superintendent and my own supervision.
 As we go through the beginning of the program, as we have each time, we'll be looking at the org chart and talking specifically about the offices whose budgets are
 are here in light of the fact that these are the offices that myself and the superintendent work most closely with.
 While Dr. Kuching, Ms.
 Galussi, Ms.
 Bowen are here, with the exception of Director McLaughlin, we will be really the only presenters and speakers tonight.
 But certainly we'll be eager to answer any questions that you have, both with respect to the offices that we are focusing on tonight and anything else that we've covered
 over the course of the last several weeks.
 And as I mentioned in my message to the committee, both last night and a few minutes ago, we will be having a budget update on the school committee agenda this coming Monday, May 24th.
 And we'll certainly be picking up questions and comments at that point, incorporating and taking in your feedback.
 And that will go into the development of the recommendations that come before you.
 prior to your June 1st statutory hearing.
 So with that, I will start, as we always do, with the timeline for our budget process, beginning with the development of the district's strategic goals and priorities, leading to a series of, some administrators might say, seemingly endless administrative meetings internally, in which we vet various proposals and comments, questions, and suggestions
 principles and evening, but have not been following along for each of the various budget presentations, both at regular school committee meetings, budget subcommittee and the committee of the whole meetings.
 This is where we are right now leading up to that June 1st public hearing in which members of the community will be invited to speak either for or against, or a favorite for those who follow municipal presentations, those wishing to speak neither for nor against.
 the budget in part or in whole.
 And again, that will take place on June 1st, but there will be a budget update on Monday, an opportunity to comment and engage in further discussion.
 We've used the org chart in each of these presentations, just as by way of showing folks, perhaps outside of the Medford Public Schools community,
 which area of the organization we're focused on in this particular meeting.
 So this is the overall org chart showing all the various offices and departments reporting up to the superintendent.
 And then these are the areas that we'll be discussing tonight.
 So you can see it's primarily the areas in my own portfolio, as well as those reporting directly to the superintendent.
 And you see the curvy arrow there on the right of the screen.
 which is indicating a reorganization of sorts that we'll be proposing as part of the FY22 budget, and that's something I'll be going into greater detail about shortly.
 So as we've discussed in each of the budget presentations, the funding for the Metro Public Schools and the funding generally for school districts across Massachusetts comes from various sources.
 What we often refer to as the Chapter 70 allocation, which is the
 The state contribution under state law coming out of ed reform law of 1993 and the funding that each school community and district are entitled to.
 The local contribution, which is the revenue generated from at the local level that is air marked for the for the school department, which in Medford is a very sizable portion of that of the overall
 operating budget.
 And then the sort of extenuating circumstances under which we're currently operating mean we have a significant influx of federal funding coming in as a result of the COVID-related legislation that has come in.
 And that is coupled with the sort of standing external funds that come in on a year-in and year-out basis, particularly in the area of special education, which we discussed at length at the May 6th Committee of the Whole when we heard from the Office of Pupil Services.
 We've said that throughout the FY22 budget, we've asked those contributing to the development of this budget, meaning our department heads and our principals, to focus essentially on three primary buckets of areas in which we're asking them what are their budgetary priorities, what are their needs, what are their challenges.
 First is personnel and staffing.
 And the committee certainly said before that when we're talking about school budgets, we're almost always talking about people.
 We're an organization made up of people, educating people, hoping to make them better people and people who are positioned to do well in their post-secondary lives.
 But that is always going to be the largest chunk of our budget because, you know, as we say sometimes in school finance, we're not focused on widgets.
 We're focused on people in a community, and that's always going to be the largest chunk.
 Materials and infrastructure, particularly under the challenging conditions under which we're operating, are always going to represent
 another, albeit smaller, aspect of the budget.
 And training and professional development, which everything is, we are looking at everything through a post-COVID context, but for training and professional development, when we think about the ways in which some of the inequities, both within public education and society at large, have come into sharper relief as a result of the experience that we've all lived through, we are thinking very much in that context when we talk about
 what are our professional development and training priorities, and what is it that we're looking to invest in.
 And particularly when we're talking about the superintendent's priorities, while much of what we're planning will be supported by external funding, given that the budget development process is the opportunity to really look at the organization as a whole, see how we're structured, how we're organized, what it is that we're pursuing, what are our discrete challenges, what are our long-term overarching challenges,
 This really is an opportunity to sort of pull the veil back on all of the Medford Public Schools.
 And my hope would be that throughout these committee of the whole presentations, as we've heard from the various directors and school leaders, my hope would be that both for the school committee and the members of the community who are either watching this in real time or perhaps watching it subsequent to the presentations, you'll see the effort toward transparency that we have employed to try to demonstrate for the community exactly what it is that we're doing.
 And I hope also
 the rationale behind these priorities.
 And this slide talks a little bit about that rationale in that these are the questions that were posed that led to the development of these priorities and that we're thinking about what are the targeted and intensive interventions that we can invest in to help reduce or eliminate the learning or opportunity gaps that have either been caused by or exacerbated by the disruption to instruction that our students have faced as a result of
 the COVID-19 pandemic.
 And so there will come a time when our budgetary priorities and our goals are not informed fully by this experience and the disruption that our students have lived through.
 At least I certainly hope that's the case.
 One of the sort of constant refrains that we go back to is we're looking to make investments that will ensure our students' academic careers are not defined by this experience.
 And hopefully if we make these investments and we execute on them wisely, that will be the case.
 But for right now,
 coming out of these, as cliche as it might sound, these unprecedented circumstances, we are looking to see how do we use the funding that's available to us from the local, state, and federal levels to try to put them in the best position possible despite the chaos that we've all lived through.
 So on April 26th, we presented to the school committee the projections that we were looking at based on the preliminary information that we had.
 uh, leading into these budget presentations.
 And we've estimated that, uh, the necessary increase in the budget would be somewhere between 3.4 and $5.8 million.
 Recognizing that there are a significant number of variables that are, uh, essentially not clear while variable one, there are restrictions on federal funding flowing in that are still not particularly clear.
 And I appreciate the mayor's comments to that effect.
 last night, but we're continuing to engage in a very constructive dialogue with our partners in the city government and reaching out to our partners at the state level and elsewhere to try to get clarity on that.
 I think at this point we feel comfortable that the priorities we've developed that we think of as having a strong nexus to the disruption caused by COVID will be essentially eligible expenses.
 It's a question of, from an administrative perspective, exactly how
 we'll go about processing those and exactly how realistic is it to do that.
 So I think we feel good about the priorities that we've identified as our COVID-related or potential ESSER-related priorities, but there's still a lot of clarity that needs to come into view in the coming weeks.
 In addition to that, we know we have fixed costs as every district does on a year-on-year basis.
 These are costs that are related to contractual obligations or
 other situations that have essentially predated the development of this budget, but we know that they're going to lead to an increase in costs.
 Other variables also include the fact that we have upwards of nine collective bargaining agreements that are expiring either at the conclusion of this school year or the conclusion of the summer.
 And so that's certainly a factor that we have to take into account as we work through the development of this budget.
 This is just information related to those external funding, the numbers the committee has seen several times before, so I won't
 belabor it, but we estimate about a $7.6 million ESSER budget over the next several years.
 And so I wouldn't say that we necessarily see that as needing to be expended in equal installments over the three or four year period that we have.
 But I would say that we want to be mindful of the fact that we're going to have additional data that will hopefully point us to more strategic uses of the funding as time goes on.
 So it may be the case that some of the more immediate expenses are in the short term, but the better use of the funding could be in year two or year three.
 And for that reason, we are looking to be, I'm not sure I would use the word conservative, but certainly cautious and cognizant of the implications of using that funding.
 And the fact is, as you've heard me say several times, these are one-time funds and the ESSER funding will not last forever.
 And so we have to be mindful of the uses
 being taking care to not create unnecessary structural deficits, and at the same time, making sure that we're being responsive to the urgent needs of students.
 And so where we strike that equilibrium is a big part of the conversations that we have been having and that we will be having.
 So I'm going to pause for one second before we move on to buildings and grounds and just talk a little bit about what you'll see over the next couple of slides in this, but I'm glad that I flashed to it quickly so that I can tell
 Mr. McLaughlin that he's on next as I continue to babble for another minute or so.
 But the departments that you're seeing starting with buildings, we're going to start with buildings and grounds and then move to the more umbrella offices of the superintendent's office and the office of finance and operations.
 And if you think back to the organizational chart that we saw at the beginning of the presentation, you can see that for both myself and Dr. Edouard-Vincent, there are a lot of priorities and funding and strategic investments
 and proposals that cut across the different departments and offices that you've already heard from.
 And that's a good thing because what we don't want to do is present a budget to you in the form of 25 siloed or overly departmentalized mini organizations.
 We want common themes and common strategic priorities that cut across.
 And so what you'll see in the bullets that we've identified are pieces that are either reflective of those priorities
 or operational pieces that are meant to put us in a position that we'll be able to actually pursue those priorities and do so successfully.
 Similar to the information technology budget proposals that we discussed in last night's committee of the whole, a large portion, arguably all, frankly, of the buildings and grounds priorities, the year maintenance issue,
 uh, that is essentially routine.
 I think routine was the word that we used in the technology presentation.
 That's something that we typically are going to incorporate one way or another into our operating budget.
 Um, something that is a one-time expense and I'm using the term one time in the context of municipal budgeting.
 And so one time could mean every 10 years, every 15 years, every 20 years, but certainly not on an annual basis.
 Um, that's every 20 years, but certainly not on an annual basis.
 That's something that we're going to look up to as a capital expense that we're going to try to keep off the operating budget for purposes of not creating some of those deficits that we've talked about.
 What we do when we have a large influx of federal funding, frankly, similar to how we handled the funding that came in during FY21, and to some extent in FY20 as well, is to try to address some of the most urgent priorities and needs that might in another context be considered a capital expense.
 but in light of the urgency, we're looking to just take what funding is available and make sure that that's addressed.
 That was certainly the case as is reflected in the buildings and grounds budget narrative that was provided to you today with regard to our HVAC repairs that we needed to expedite and accelerate at the beginning of this school year for purposes of getting students and staff back into the physical school buildings.
 And so I expressed my appreciation for Mr. McLaughlin and members of his team who partnered with
 the external experts that we brought in to make that a reality.
 The history as to how we got to the place where so much work was necessary, I think, has been addressed at length in previous meetings.
 But however we got here, we are in a much better position from an air quality perspective because that work was done throughout the course of this year.
 And now we're looking at some of the other heavy infrastructure pieces that may not land in the operating budget for FY22.
 but are critical priorities that need to be addressed in the near term.
 And I'm going to ask Mr. McLaughlin, if he could, to walk us through some of these.
 As we're talking about how these investments need to be made in the coming year or months.
 So John, do you want to take it from there and just start maybe with the generator and transformer electrical issues that we have
 been identified at the high school and at the Andrews and then we'll walk through some of the other pieces.
 From there we'll move on to finance operations in the superintendent's office and then we'll go to questions after that.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=1158.093s">[John McLaughlin]</a>: Excelente.
 Buenas noches alcalde, superintendente, miembros del comité escolar y administradores.
 en la reunión de esta noche.
 Entonces, el primer problema, la falla de los amplificadores de transformadores son los proyectos eléctricos en Medford High School y Andrews Middle School.
 Entonces creo que somos conscientes del hecho de que el generador de emergencia
 Es necesario reemplazar uno de los generadores de emergencia de la escuela secundaria Medford.
 Lo hemos discutido.
 Estamos en camino de obtener una RFP e información de precios para intentar conseguir ese proyecto. ¿Alguien más abandonó el audio?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=1195.2s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: ¿No?

 Creo que estamos bien, John.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=1214.44s">[John McLaughlin]</a>: Bueno, bien.
 Entonces, en la Escuela Andrews, ese tema ya ha sido eliminado de mi presupuesto regular.
 Hicimos escaneos eléctricos infrarrojos de todos los edificios y hubo un problema con un disyuntor en el Andrews que tenemos.
 reparado, eso es bueno.
 También disponemos de transformador.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=1251.451s">[John McLaughlin]</a>: Oh chico.
 ¿Quieres que empiece de nuevo, Melanie?
 ¿Quieres que empiece?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=1256.274s">[Kathy Kreatz]</a>: Kathy, ¿puedes oírlo ahora?
 Sí, perdí, tampoco pude oírte, John.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=1262.233s">[John McLaughlin]</a>: Bueno.
 No sé.
 Ya tengo el punto de acceso activo.
 Yo, yo, ya sabes, me he estado preparando para esto por un tiempo.
 De todos modos, entonces, uh, sí, entonces el, uh, el disyuntor o el amplificador, uh, trans, uh, el disyuntor fue reemplazado en la escuela secundaria de Andrews.
 Así que estamos de vuelta donde necesitamos estar.
 Um, era parte de, uh, habíamos tenido, um, seguro, uh, inspección, escaneo infrarrojo de todos los sistemas eléctricos.
 en la escuela secundaria, hasta la facultad de derecho, disculpe.
 Y así pudimos encargarnos de eso con mi presupuesto de operaciones habitual.
 Así lo sabemos, también sabemos sobre el generador de emergencia, que se está preparando para salir para una RFP.
 Además, el transformador es un equipo original de Medford High School.
 Entonces lo que pasó fue, es cuando,
 hace años tendría PCB.
 Entonces tuvimos que quitarle los PCB y ponerle otro tipo de aceite.
 Y lo que termina sucediendo es que los sellos de goma tienden a ceder.
 Entonces estoy en el proceso de obtener una cotización.
 Lo tengo, lo acabo de recibir hoy para revisar el transformador.
 Y asegúrese de que podamos regresar a donde necesitamos estar.
 Tiene un poco de poco aceite, todavía está funcionando, pero ciertamente es algo que tiene que tener prioridad porque también funciona como un tercio de la potencia.
 en la escuela secundaria de Medford.
 Entonces tendremos la información de precios lista para continuar con eso.
 Y ese sería un proyecto de verano, obviamente, con el generador, siempre y cuando estemos listos para asumir ese proyecto.
 Este año, tuvimos algunas mejoras de seguridad.
 Teníamos un nuevo sistema Raptor.
 Instalé todos los monitores en este momento, recibí capacitación sobre el nuevo sistema Raptor.
 Si no sabes que el sistema Raptor es donde entras, te das una licencia y ellos la escanean.
 Si todo está bien, obtiene una etiqueta y está listo para ir a la oficina principal para realizar los asuntos que necesita realizar en cualquiera de nuestras escuelas.
 Así que cada tres o cuatro años nos gusta terminar el estacionamiento.
 Por lo general, son todos ellos, debería decir, en todo el sistema.
 Los estacionamientos están nuevamente delimitados, están empezando a envejecer.
 Queríamos hacer algunos
 ajustes en Mefford High School, con los que nos reuniremos en lo que respecta a la situación de estacionamiento para discapacitados.
 Sé que hemos tenido esa conversación cuando hablábamos de la entrada principal.
 Y creo que lo que queremos hacer es trasladarnos a los lugares para discapacitados en el circuito frontal de Mefford High School y acceder a la rampa para discapacitados que está justo allí.
 Entonces eso sería, ya sabes, lo revisaremos.
 hablé con
 alcalde Lungo-Koehn la semana pasada, así que si necesito ayuda, tenemos el departamento de tráfico en el Ayuntamiento, estarán más que felices de ayudarnos.
 Nos reunimos con ellos hace un par de años para intentar hacer algunas mejoras, pero como todos sabemos, el año pasado no ha sido el año típico con el que normalmente tratamos.
 El Proyecto de Caldera Curtis Tufts, así que el invierno pasado, la caldera empezó a tener fugas.
 Todas estas son cosas que probablemente abordaremos la próxima semana en la reunión del subcomité.
 Así que pedimos algunas piezas que deben reinstalarse, es decir, seccionales.
 Así que pudimos obtener dos seccionales que van a reemplazar y eso debería detener las fugas, esperamos.
 Y eso será, será un dinero significativo el que tendremos que gastar en ello.
 y mejoras en HVAC.
 Entonces sabemos que hemos hecho mucho de eso.
 En este momento, estamos poniendo en funcionamiento el aire acondicionado.
 Entonces hay problemas asociados con eso, ciertas áreas particulares aquí y allá que necesitamos traer a nuestro contratista para arreglarlas.
 Esto es por ley, tenemos que ofrecer calefacción hasta el 15 de mayo.
 Entonces esta sería la semana en la que hacemos la facturación.
 Desafortunadamente, ha hecho calor esta semana, lo cual, ya sabes, es una tontería, pero ha hecho calor esta semana.
 Algunos de los profesores en las aulas se han sentido un poco incómodos, pero estamos trabajando en ello.
 Sabemos que estás ahí.
 Saldremos y nos ocuparemos de todo lo que tengamos que hacer lo antes posible, lo antes posible.
 llamando al contratista.
 Solo estoy tratando de obtener una lista de lo que debemos hacer y qué edificios deben hacerse.
 Um, el proyecto de rehabilitación de baños.
 Dave y yo nos reunimos con el arquitecto.
 Um, creo que estábamos esperando simplemente para obtener el visto bueno y ver y hacer las RFP para ese proyecto.
 Fue, sé que esto es un, um,
 proyecto de Mefford High School que será cercano y querido por mucha gente que mejora los baños.
 Queremos, lo sé.
 El alcalde nos pidió que investigáramos cuántos podíamos hacer.
 Creo que si conseguimos un precio para uno, sabremos dónde estamos y luego podremos avanzar lo más que podamos desde allí.
 El proyecto de rehabilitación de la entrada principal, todavía estamos esperando.
 para ver a dónde vamos a llegar con eso.
 Uno de nuestros muchachos que trabaja en el departamento de conserjería, es albañil, así que se ofreció como voluntario para salir y tratar de arreglar la pared, la pared de granito un poco.
 Así que hoy está ahí afuera trabajando.
 Quiero decir, espero que pueda hacer que se vea un poco mejor, pero aún así será
 Qué, qué es, y luego sabes que ciertamente podemos reunirnos en la entrada principal y creo que hablaremos y discutiremos eso la próxima semana y el subcomité sobre cómo queremos avanzar con eso.
 Y por eso, creo que cada año, dentro de mi presupuesto, siempre pido una camioneta con arado.
 Entonces eso no ha cambiado.
 Ciertamente ayudaría en la nieve, ciertamente ayudaría con otros, varios proyectos en todo el distrito.
 Si en algún momento conseguimos una camioneta con un arado.
 De esa manera, ya sabes, puedo ayudar al DPW muchas veces, ya que se mueven muy rápidamente.
 Y, ya sabes, a veces hay áreas que necesitan ser retocadas a las que no pueden regresar porque su objetivo principal son las carreteras que rodean la ciudad.
 Por lo tanto, sin duda ayudaría con la eficiencia de tener algo así.
 a nuestra disposición, camioneta pick up.
 Ahora, la renovación del teatro actual y, si ven mi informe previo al presupuesto, supongo.
 Si tuviera un proyecto que me gustaría que se hiciera realidad, sería agregar aire acondicionado, barandillas, mejorar las puertas y hacer algunos trabajos eléctricos en el teatro.
 Entonces, hace unos años, obtuve un precio y los precios ahora son diferentes: $100,000 para agregar una unidad de aire acondicionado al techo del cine.
 Creo que también sería beneficioso para la comunidad.
 generar ingresos también para la escuela y tal vez agregar eso en algún momento, ponerlo en nuestra lista de mejoras capitales.
 Es solo que, como dije, si pudiera elegir el proyecto que me gustaría hacer con la escuela secundaria, ese sería uno de mis proyectos principales, los proyectos de renovación.
 Y luego siempre estamos trabajando en proyectos de mejora de HVAC en la escuela secundaria.
 Ya sabes, en algún momento, ya sabes, tal vez recibamos ayuda de la MSBA, tal vez podamos agregar aire acondicionado y otras partes de Mefford High School que no lo tienen en este momento, lo que significa que el laboratorio de ciencias es la única parte real del edificio que tiene aire acondicionado.
 servicio, ya sabes, excepto los aires acondicionados de ventana que tenemos por todas partes.
 Entonces no puedo ver el fondo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=1801.416s">[David Murphy]</a>: Creo que estamos en el fondo.
 Bueno.
 Sí.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=1804.117s">[John McLaughlin]</a>: Entonces, estaré encantado de atender cualquier pregunta que puedas tener sobre lo que está pasando.
 Uh, estaremos entreteniendo a la mayoría de ellos la próxima semana, el día 26.
 Tendremos una reunión del subcomité aquí en Zoom.
 Uh, pero sería más que, uh,
 Bienvenido a responder cualquier pregunta, gracias.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=1823.649s">[David Murphy]</a>: Gracias, Juan.
 Alcalde, recomendaría que sigamos con nuestro proceso de realización de la presentación y luego yo, John, el Dr. Edwards y otros estaremos encantados de responder todas las preguntas si eso funciona para usted.
 Eso funciona para mí.
 Bien, gracias.
 Entonces, a medida que pasamos al resto de la administración central, las oficinas del superintendente y mi propia oficina,
 Mencionamos antes que hay una serie de departamentos que encajan dentro de estos grandes paraguas.
 Edificios y terrenos, sin duda uno de los más grandes y, francamente, uno de los más visibles.
 Y ciertamente, es por eso que le pedimos al Sr. McLaughlin que estuviera presente esta noche para hablar sobre algunos de los detalles.
 Y muy rápidamente sobre el último punto con respecto a este presupuesto relacionado con las mejoras de HVAC en la escuela secundaria.
 Francamente, es un buen ejemplo de esa distinción entre mantenimiento y capital.
 Cuando actualizamos algunos de los filtros alrededor de la escuela secundaria para mejorar la calidad del aire, incurrimos en un costo fijo adicional con respecto al reemplazo del filtro.
 Parte del uso de filtros de mayor calidad es que pasamos de un sistema de reemplazo dos veces al año a uno trimestral.
 Francamente, ese no es un costo significativo para el distrito, pero es un costo de mantenimiento.
 A diferencia de una caldera,
 o un generador transformador, una de esas piezas que ciertamente no tenemos expectativas de incurrir en costos anualmente.
 Y eso es algo que incorporaríamos en un presupuesto y planificación de capital en los próximos años.
 Entonces, con respecto al presupuesto del superintendente y al presupuesto de la Oficina de Finanzas y Operaciones, hay partes de esto que, como mencioné antes, están interconectadas con algunas de las otras prioridades y algunas de las otras
 inversiones estratégicas que le han recomendado.
 Primero, con respecto al presupuesto del superintendente, han escuchado nuestro enfoque a lo largo de este año, disculpe, durante todo el proceso de desarrollo del presupuesto en asegurarnos de que estamos identificando oportunidades de desarrollo profesional y capacitación para el personal que sean consistentes con las necesidades del distrito durante este contexto posterior a COVID.
 Bueno, los $75,000, que en realidad podrían ser un poco menos que eso, porque se distribuirán en dos o tres años fiscales.
 Entonces será un poco más bajo que eso.
 Hemos identificado oportunidades de desarrollo profesional que serán intensivas y responderán al contexto en el que el distrito seguirá funcionando en los próximos años.
 Y así tenemos un desarrollo profesional social y emocional específico.
 así como capacitación sobre prejuicios implícitos que en realidad comenzará al final del año fiscal 21 y luego se trasladará a los años fiscales siguientes, abiertos al personal en general al principio y a los administradores.
 Será un programa obligatorio hacia finales del verano de 2021.
 Entonces, si el Dr. Edouard-Vincent o el Dr. Cushing quieren hablar un poco más sobre los beneficios y cómo vemos esta capacitación.
 como algo que encaja con la estrategia general que hemos estado defendiendo a lo largo de este proceso.
 Y sólo un último punto al respecto.
 Anticipo que la mayor parte de esta financiación de estos gastos será cubierta por algunos de los fondos externos a los que hicimos referencia al comienzo de la presentación.
 Entonces, el Título II en particular, así como potencialmente parte de la financiación de ESSER, pero el Título II específicamente se utilizará para cubrir los costos en los que se incurrirá para el año fiscal 21.
 parte y luego pasar al año fiscal 22 también.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=2055.034s">[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>: Así que no estoy seguro si alguno de los Dres. Solo quería enfatizar el valor y la importancia de
 desarrollo profesional de calidad y verdaderamente trabajando en colaboración con el Dr. Cushing también.
 Para abordar algunos de los cambios significativos que haremos el próximo año, especialmente en el área del aprendizaje socioemocional.
 Una de las áreas que fue un encargo del comité escolar fue en términos de cómo el distrito abordará la suspensión, que cae bajo el paraguas de conductas de aprendizaje socioemocional, etc.
 Entonces esa es definitivamente una gran prioridad.
 para nosotros, y esa es una de las áreas objetivo del desarrollo profesional.
 Además de eso, continuaremos nuestra búsqueda de comprensión y mayor desarrollo profesional sobre los prejuicios implícitos y las implicaciones para nuestras comunidades escolares.
 También tendremos desarrollo profesional adicional sobre las mejores prácticas como líderes de instrucción y educadores.
 con respecto al sistema de evaluación de educadores para aumentar la responsabilidad en todas nuestras escuelas.
 Entonces esos son tres cubos grandes.
 Y cuando abordamos el sesgo implícito, también abordamos la competencia cultural, el trabajo antirracista, el antiodio,
 Entonces, todas esas iniciativas son muy importantes a medida que estamos cambiando como distrito para satisfacer las necesidades de todos nuestros estudiantes y de la comunidad en general.
 También continuaremos analizando la concientización sobre la discapacidad y encontrando formas, nuevamente, de cómo eso se superpone con los prejuicios.
 que existen por ahí.
 Así que solo quería enfatizar que, si bien ven nuestra prioridad, las prioridades de todo el distrito en materia de desarrollo profesional, para cambiar la mentalidad y realmente presentar nueva información, el desarrollo profesional es de vital importancia.
 Así que sólo quería enfatizar esa parte.
 Gracias.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=2199.759s">[David Murphy]</a>: Gracias, Superintendente.
 Dr. Cushing, ¿algo que quisiera agregar en función de su participación en estos programas?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=2207.372s">[Peter Cushing]</a>: Sí, muy rápidamente, el superintendente hizo un trabajo maravilloso al explicar los puestos con los que esperamos avanzar.
 También lo que estamos haciendo es que a fines de junio ofreceremos un programa de capacitación de capacitadores para el sesgo implícito y el aprendizaje socioemocional en el aula y cada uno de esos cursos tendrá 20 miembros del personal en todo el distrito.
 Uh, capacitado para poder luego desplegar el distrito para implementar el desarrollo profesional dentro del distrito.
 Y lo que este modelo nos permitirá hacer es que nos permitirá ser muy rentables, pero también nos permitirá implementar el desarrollo profesional a lo largo del año de la manera que mejor se adapte a las necesidades de Medford.
 Um, y podremos involucrar mejor a nuestro personal.
 con sus pares y líderes escolares, ya sean directores, directores o subdirectores, quienes recibirán estas capacitaciones y luego darán la vuelta y podrán implementar este desarrollo profesional de clase mundial para ellos.
 Y creo que es una gran oportunidad para que Medford dé el siguiente paso para brindar el mejor desarrollo profesional posible a nuestro personal.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=2280.431s">[David Murphy]</a>: Gracias, doctor Cushing.
 Y luego pasar a la oficina de finanzas y operaciones.
 Y como puede ver, aquí hay algunas viñetas diferentes.
 Me centraré en tres, incluido el transporte, que creo que tiene su propio tobogán y lo tiene, gracias.
 Pero primero, los dos primeros, a esto se aludió durante la presentación de anoche.
 Y creo que surgió en el contexto de la prioridad identificada por el departamento de estudiantes de inglés.
 querer invertir en una oportunidad para desarrollar nuestros esfuerzos, esencialmente nuestro compromiso familiar y nuestras relaciones comunitarias.
 Y señalé en ese momento que parte de la razón por la que no hemos identificado una inversión específica en el departamento de EL específicamente para el año fiscal 22 es porque tenemos una inversión del distrito que esperamos que avance esa causa y estaremos trabajando.
 estrechamente con el departamento de EL, el departamento de servicios de salud, educación especial y otros lugares.
 Creo que cuando pensamos en cómo estructuramos la organización y cómo organizamos carteras de trabajo específicas, como regla general, la mejor práctica es identificar la necesidad, identificar la necesidad que se está satisfaciendo o una necesidad que se desarrolla como resultado de otras variables de cambio,
 y luego determinar la mejor manera de desarrollar roles y carteras que encajen en una estructura organizacional que pueda promover esos objetivos.
 Sin embargo, hay ocasiones en las que hay una confluencia de eventos en los que tenemos personas que desempeñan funciones de liderazgo con capacidad disponible y necesidades que están surgiendo y volviéndose más urgentes.
 Y ese tipo de confluencia se produjo a lo largo del año escolar.
 Y seré franco, una de las formas en que nos llamó la atención fue cuando necesitábamos desplegar toda nuestra unidad administrativa en las escuelas para que sirvieran como maestros sustitutos.
 Y cuando quedó claro que eso era agotador y prácticamente imposible, y tratamos de hacer diferentes modificaciones, nuestra directora de programación antes y después de la escuela continuó ofreciéndose como voluntaria para asumir eso y siguió comunicándonos como lo había hecho durante algún tiempo que sentía que
 había espacio en su cartera para responsabilidades adicionales y el tipo de confidencias, la competencia que tenemos en el individuo como administrador y como líder.
 Y el hecho de que hemos superado este año escolar, pero al poder identificar prácticas que podemos mejorar y trabajar mejor en el área de participación de padres y familias,
 fue consiguiendo la ayuda de Diane Caldwell, nuestra ex superintendente asociada, quien ha trabajado muy hábilmente como directora principal del Centro de información para padres.
 Y diré, como alguien nuevo en el distrito y heredado el Centro de información para padres como parte de mi cartera en mi primera semana, sin la Sra.
 Caldwell,
 Al estar disponible para brindar ese liderazgo y brindar esa orientación y conocimiento institucional, habría sido un año mucho, mucho más desafiante, no solo con respecto a la supervisión del PIC, sino con respecto esencialmente a todos los demás elementos del trabajo del que yo y otros administradores superiores somos responsables.
 Pero sabemos desde el principio que la Sra.
 Caldwell como administrador del Centro de información para padres no era una solución permanente y tratar de operar dentro de
 Según nuestros parámetros presupuestarios, no buscábamos necesariamente financiar un director del Centro de información para padres como un puesto único sin otras responsabilidades.
 Y entonces la Sra.
 Fidler transmite voluntad y entusiasmo para asumir responsabilidades adicionales.
 Y lo que sentimos es un fuerte nexo natural entre el Centro de Información para Padres y el Programa de Escuelas Pobres y Ausentes, así como el apoyo adicional
 uh, capacidad que necesitábamos, um, necesitábamos en el, en el, en el ámbito de las relaciones familiares con respecto al transporte.
 Um, pensamos que esto encajaba como una cartera administrativa legítima, um, completa.
 Y entonces, como parte del presupuesto del año fiscal 22, proponemos reorganizar esas oficinas en un área general de participación familiar que incluirá la supervisión del centro de información para padres, la supervisión continua del programa antes y después de la escuela.
 y servicio como enlace de transporte.
 Ahora bien, todos estos roles, francamente, una de las razones por las que encajan es que son diferentes partes del año escolar donde requieren un mayor grado de atención y detalle.
 Y es por eso que digo que es una especie de confluencia en el sentido de que encaja muy bien en términos de crear un puesto completo de 12 meses con alguien que ya tiene el conocimiento institucional.
 y ha realizado un gran trabajo para el distrito en el pasado.
 Y eso es parte de por qué poder hacerlo de manera eficiente, pero también con confianza en cómo eso avanzaría más efectivamente en las metas del distrito con respecto a las asociaciones familiares y comunitarias, es parte de cómo se ha desarrollado esa propuesta.
 Entonces esa es una pieza.
 Y luego verás, como también se mencionó anoche,
 Hemos establecido un puesto de coordinador de subvenciones.
 Eso por sí solo es algo no presupuestario, no necesariamente tiene un efecto en el presupuesto operativo y las subvenciones que el individuo que ha estado sirviendo esencialmente como coordinador de subvenciones no oficial durante algún tiempo, pero técnicamente en el rol de asistente ejecutivo, hemos podido trasladar a esa persona a la oficina de finanzas y operaciones, trabajando con Michelle Kingdon y su personal para garantizar que estemos
 Cumplir con todas nuestras obligaciones y ejecutar desde una perspectiva de cumplimiento de la manera más efectiva posible.
 Eso es diferente y quiero señalarlo.
 Ciertamente es diferente al rol de redactor de subvenciones que no tenemos actualmente, pero estamos explorando otras formas en las que podríamos liberar algo de capacidad para brindarles a los administradores la oportunidad de estar bien posicionados para cultivar asociaciones externas y
 y buscar oportunidades de subvenciones que nuestro coordinador de subvenciones estaría entonces en condiciones de ayudar a coordinar y tratar de liberar capacidad presupuestaria adicional de esa manera.
 Antes de pasar al transporte, solo diré, una vez más, que es una especie de continuación de nuestra conversación de anoche.
 Hemos continuado nuestra asociación a lo largo de este año escolar con Management Solution y el Sr. Paquette, quien se desempeñó como interino
 un administrador de empresas entre la Sra.
 Patterson y yo.
 Y tenemos el informe que se encargó está listo para ser entregado al comité escolar.
 Básicamente, pedí un apéndice del informe porque el informe se realizó a lo largo del año escolar y de alguna manera se incorporó a este proceso de desarrollo del presupuesto.
 Y le pregunté al Sr. Parkett si, basándose en el anticipo que todavía tenemos,
 Básicamente, puede completar un breve suplemento que tomaría en cuenta algunos de los cambios que hicimos, Sra.
 Kimu y yo hemos puesto en práctica a lo largo de los últimos meses.
 Por eso anticipo entregárselo al comité antes de que finalice este año fiscal.
 Y luego, Sr. Parkett, nuestra asociación con la Universidad de Tufts, que comenzó como una asociación en el ámbito de las pruebas y ha progresado hasta convertirse en conversaciones.
 dentro del ámbito de la infraestructura tecnológica y algo de lo que espero que podamos beneficiarnos con gran eficiencia durante el transcurso del verano.
 Pero luego también buscaremos explorar qué otra experiencia externa deberíamos retener o con la que potencialmente consultar mientras miramos hacia el año fiscal 22.
 Esa es una descripción general de alto nivel.
 Terminaré con el transporte y luego pasaré a tus preguntas.
 Si recuerda que cuando hablamos de las proyecciones para el año fiscal 22, teníamos un aumento de costos de alrededor de 51,000.
 Estos son, debería decirlo rápidamente porque se abordaron el 6 de mayo.
 Estos no están relacionados con nuestros costos fijos de transporte relacionados con nuestra educación especial.
 Este es nuestro principal proveedor, Eastern Bus.
 El comité escolar celebró un nuevo contrato de tres años en la primavera de 2020.
 Así que estamos completando el primero de esos.
 del contrato de tres años.
 Como siempre ocurre con los contratos, el coste aumenta año tras año.
 Entonces, estamos viendo un aumento de aproximadamente $ 51,000 en ese contrato como parte de nuestro aumento estimado de $ 2,1 millones en costos fijos.
 Ya vio los siguientes dos números anteriormente, el 26 de abril, cuando se realizó una solicitud sobre los pases MBTA.
 Esa es esencialmente una opción que estamos
 asegurándose de que el comité esté al tanto.
 Y luego hubo preguntas relacionadas con cuál sería esencialmente el costo de los autobuses amarillos adicionales y, potencialmente, de proporcionar capacidad adicional de autobuses del Este en la escuela secundaria.
 Calculamos que ronda los 75.000 dólares.
 La razón por la que digo que es de cero a $75,000 es que en nuestras conversaciones con el proveedor, ellos tienen,
 Creo, y aprecio esto, que no sé que todos los proveedores lo harían, pero han sugerido que, según el radio que este distrito adoptó antes de este año escolar, es posible que, con respecto al transporte de las escuelas primarias y secundarias, sea posible reutilizar parte de nuestra capacidad existente para proporcionar al menos un autobús adicional a la escuela secundaria.
 Tenemos reuniones la próxima semana con
 el proveedor de autobuses, así como el Departamento de Policía de Medford, donde analizaremos una serie de cuestiones, tanto relacionadas con la seguridad como con la planificación del desarrollo de rutas y paradas para el próximo año escolar durante el transcurso del verano.
 Entonces, francamente, no tengo una recomendación para el comité en este momento relacionada con si deberíamos agregar un segundo autobús.
 Creo que está claro que es posible que podamos hacerlo.
 Y luego creo que es cuestión de observar los datos sobre dónde
 qué son los estudiantes de secundaria y si existe una demanda para ello.
 Diré que en mis breves conversaciones con la administración de la escuela secundaria, no está del todo claro que sepamos que existe una demanda clara para esto, que es algo que creo que queremos tener en cuenta.
 Pero al mismo tiempo, si el costo de proporcionar algo que podría ser mucho más conveniente para los estudiantes está entre cero y $75,000, obviamente eso es algo que querríamos considerar.
 Creo que desde una perspectiva estratégica, debemos tener en cuenta que los pases MBTA obviamente brindan potencialmente más acceso.
 Y, ya sabes, empiezas a pensar en trabajos para estudiantes, en la oportunidad de ir a la ciudad.
 Hay otros tipos de experiencias de ciudad como aula y experiencias de aprendizaje experiencial que los pases MBTA podrían brindar a los estudiantes.
 Estamos analizando todas esas opciones.
 Y nuevamente, un hilo común que atraviesa todas las presentaciones es nuestra determinación de establecer una jornada escolar extendida efectiva y una programación extracurricular para nuestros estudiantes en el año escolar 21-22 mediante el uso de los fondos ESSER para garantizar que brindemos el mayor apoyo de recuperación posible a raíz de las importantes interrupciones que han enfrentado los estudiantes.
 Así que le agradezco su tiempo y su indulgencia al respecto.
 Si disfrutaron las presentaciones cuando había más testimonios y testigos a quienes podía entregárselas, les prometo que yo también las disfruté más.
 Pero esas son las presentaciones para edificios y terrenos, la oficina de finanzas y operaciones, así como la oficina del superintendente.
 Y en este momento, estaré más que feliz de responder sus preguntas.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3062.978s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Gracias, Sr. Murphy.
 Tenemos al miembro Van der Kloot, luego al miembro Rousseau.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3068.903s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Gracias.
 Voy a continuar al final sobre el transporte en autobús para la escuela secundaria.
 Dave, nos has presentado algunas opciones interesantes, pero con diferencias bastante grandes en los precios.
 En este punto, mientras estás elaborando este presupuesto,
 ¿Qué estás, nos estás haciendo una recomendación?
 ¿Vamos a, quiero decir, cómo vamos a incluir el costo en el presupuesto?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3100.169s">[David Murphy]</a>: Bueno, creo que la primera, sí, la primera determinación es si el comité se siente cómodo con el radio que se estableció el año pasado con respecto al radio de una milla para todos los grados con excepción del jardín de infantes.
 Entonces, si eso es algo que el comité quiere mantener,
 entonces el vendedor básicamente ha dicho que una de las escuelas primarias tendrá un exceso de capacidad.
 Entonces, el contrato existente que sería de $1.4 millones o algo así para Eastern Bus nos proporcionará un autobús escolar adicional que creo que probablemente deberíamos considerar usar en la escuela secundaria para expandir esa capacidad.
 Mi única duda es
 que si no lo hiciéramos, es posible que podamos reutilizarlo para programación después de clases y jornada escolar extendida sin ese costo potencial adicional de $100,000.
 O al menos eso lo costearía.
 Así que creo que la primera determinación es si el comité se siente cómodo con el radio de una milla, que según el proveedor no tendrá un impacto dramático en el número de pasajeros.
 Y esencialmente ahí es donde nos encontramos ahora.
 Y si ese es el caso,
 Entonces creo que el siguiente paso es observar los datos relacionados con el lugar donde residen los estudiantes de secundaria y si hay o no una ruta que tenga sentido para saber dónde están los estudiantes.
 Y nuevamente, el único inconveniente que le vería a ese plan es que la MBTA aprueba, no te llevan simplemente a la escuela.
 Y creo que, en particular, para nuestros estudiantes de secundaria, existe una enorme cantidad de oportunidades de aprendizaje experiencial a las que podrían abrirles los pases MBTA.
 Y lo último que diría es que el pase MBTA se ha convertido en una inversión mucho mejor si vinculamos oportunidades programáticas a su adquisición.
 Y creo que puede tomar algo de tiempo, tal vez el verano sea suficiente, para darles a nuestros líderes de instrucción el tiempo para desarrollar ese tipo de oportunidades que luego maximicen esa inversión potencial.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3230.138s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Entonces Dave, volvamos a una de las cosas que dijiste sobre el radio de una milla.
 Y tengo que decirles que realmente no recuerdo haber votado sobre eso.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3239.024s">[David Murphy]</a>: Entonces... Esto fue precedido en mi época, pero tengo entendido que cuando ese plan de reapertura se presentó al comité escolar en masa como una especie de plan grande y multifacético, el radio era una parte de eso.
 Y así se ajustaron las rutas, las paradas.
 También pienso, y lo sé sólo anecdóticamente,
 Eso debido a que el número de pasajeros disminuyó tanto este año, normalmente eliminas las paradas de autobús y escuchas una especie de ola de comentarios, eso no se materializó este año.
 Y puede deberse a que el número de pasajeros disminuyó mucho debido a la pandemia.
 Si eso no se traslada al próximo año, es algo que probablemente quieras considerar.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3280.253s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sí, lo estaría, creo que era perfectamente comprensible que nuestro número de pasajeros disminuyera mucho.
 Sé que en Medford ha habido un historial de algunos estudiantes que reciben servicio de autobús debido a preocupaciones sobre las carreteras donde viven y la seguridad de las mismas.
 Entonces, decir automáticamente que es una milla, bueno, nunca ha sido automáticamente una milla.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3307.655s">[David Murphy]</a>: Un punto importante, y me disculpo por ello,
 Si asumo que eso es evidente, el radio no tiene nada que ver con las exenciones de seguridad.
 Y su parada de autobús es parte de la conversación que tendremos la próxima semana.
 Y es por eso que no solo estará representado el distrito y el vendedor, sino que también estará representado el Departamento de Policía Metropolitana.
 Porque a medida que revisamos y analizamos rutas y paradas, queremos asegurarnos de que cualquier parada que haya generado inquietudes relacionadas con la seguridad sea examinada de cerca por expertos en seguridad pública y que
 Sin duda, las exenciones de seguridad anulan cualquier otra política con respecto al radio.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3344.167s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sí, bueno, parte de esto es, ya sabes, la seguridad percibida o ha estado en vigor durante tanto tiempo que cualquier movimiento para eliminarlo ciertamente causará un revuelo.
 Parece que, te escucho en un nivel optimista, vamos a tener algo de espacio y podremos utilizar un autobús existente.
 Eso me suena muy optimista, Dave, y soy optimista en general, pero no estoy tan preparado para equilibrarnos unos a otros.
 Sí, y en el extremo superior, es 350, lo cual es una gran cantidad de cambio.
 Y hay algunos, solo estoy tratando de decir que, con un número tan grande, es difícil entender exactamente a dónde vamos a llegar en términos de lo que estamos poniendo en el presupuesto.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3389.268s">[David Murphy]</a>: Sí, todo eso es un buen punto.
 Estos datos son en respuesta a las consultas del comité, para que quede claro.
 No, no tengo, ciertamente no tengo una recomendación sobre de dónde vendrían los 350.000.
 Entonces, para ser sincero al respecto.
 Bueno.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3403.415s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Sí.
 Y al mismo tiempo, aprecio que mis colegas hayan planteado esta cuestión porque es una cuestión y es una cuestión de justicia.
 Entonces, creo claramente que vamos a tener más conversaciones al respecto.
 Bueno.
 Me entrego a otra persona.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3421.005s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Tenemos al miembro Rousseau, al miembro Kreatz, Graham y McLaughlin.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3426.066s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: Gracias, alcalde.
 Gracias por la presentación.
 Lo aprecio.
 Me pregunto dónde, y perdónenme si ya lo hemos cubierto, pero no creo que tengamos transporte para deportes y banda.
 ¿Y eso está por llegar?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3448.128s">[David Murphy]</a>: La pregunta es: ¿está eso incluido en los datos que tienen ante ustedes esta noche?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3452.33s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: Sí.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3453.891s">[David Murphy]</a>: No, pero sólo porque vive de los presupuestos deportivos o de bellas artes.
 Y entonces esas líneas serán restauradas a su año fiscal.
 Uno de ellos nunca se redujo, pero se mantendrán o se restaurarán a sus números del año fiscal 20.
 Entonces, para garantizar que tengamos suficiente transporte para todos los eventos y eventos deportivos y cosas de esa naturaleza.
 Y eso fue a petición de esos jefes de departamento.
 Por lo tanto, hasta donde yo sé, no hubo ninguna solicitud para exceder los niveles anteriores al año fiscal 21.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3487.681s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: Bien, gracias.
 Simplemente, ya sabes, parece que recordar la prepandemia a veces es en realidad un desafío, pero, ya sabes, mi memoria es eso, ya sabes,
 No teníamos una distribución equitativa de los fondos de transporte para diferentes tipos de grupos, así que simplemente lo diré.
 Fuimos más que generosos con la financiación del transporte relacionado con los deportes y la gente de la banda tuvo que vender todo lo que tenían para conseguir suficiente dinero para el transporte en autobús.
 Y este es mi cuarto presupuesto.
 Y desde hace cuatro años, no soy el único que dice
 Necesitamos un desglose de lo que gastamos en actividades extracurriculares por estudiante.
 Porque confiando en mi instinto, no tengo hijos para participar en deportes.
 Tengo hijos que participan en la banda.
 No estoy interesado en hacer grandes declaraciones o sugerir cambios de política sin ningún dato.
 Pero mi sensación, al observar los estipendios para los deportes,
 Los entrenadores en nuestro contrato versus las personas que dirigen la banda y otros estipendios, claramente hay algún tipo de discrepancia que tal vez sea apropiada según la cantidad de horas dedicadas, pero no tengo forma de saberlo.
 Por eso, realmente quiero saber que no estamos favoreciendo a los niños que deciden participar en un deporte y reduciendo la carga de sus familias para recaudar fondos para el transporte.
 en comparación con los niños que están en la banda o, y solo estoy usando esos dos ejemplos.
 Estoy seguro de que hay otros.
 Entonces, la restauración obviamente es mejor que no la restauración, pero no tengo forma de saber si esto es realmente justo.
 Y eso es realmente un gran problema para mí.
 Y este es el cuarto presupuesto donde este ha sido un tema.
 El cuarto año donde lo he querido, y me doy cuenta que no estabas en los tres últimos presupuestos.
 Entonces, ya sabes, un desglose por estudiante, ¿cuánto estamos gastando?
 Y quiero decir, eso incluye los estipendios que están en los contratos de los maestros.
 Y eso, quiero decir, todo el dinero que gastamos en educación no desde jardín de infantes hasta octavo grado, ¿en qué lo estamos gastando?
 ¿A dónde va?
 ¿Y es realmente justo?
 Quiero decir, porque quiero decir, sé que los deportes son muy importantes para mucha gente,
 La prohibición es muy importante para mucha gente.
 Y realmente creo que tenemos que llegar al fondo de eso.
 No creo que esto sea algo que podamos resolver esta noche.
 Y me sorprendió no tener una idea real de si eso se está abordando o no.
 Pero me di cuenta, por supuesto, de que no estuviste presente en los últimos tres presupuestos.
 Sí.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3661.661s">[David Murphy]</a>: No, es una gran pregunta.
 Y creo que tienes razón.
 Quiero decir, a veces hay diferentes niveles de gastos.
 Creo que la mayoría de las veces,
 Esta discrepancia se crea en los distritos debido al sistema de paz que existe en torno al atletismo.
 Y creo que así es como a menudo terminas viendo esa discrepancia, pero juegan un papel muy paralelo en términos de ser el elemento de nuestro programa educativo que involucra a los estudiantes y los mantiene francamente viniendo aquí y ciertamente divirtiéndose y aprovechando al máximo su educación.
 Así que estoy feliz de profundizar en eso y ver si hay
 si hay brechas que potencialmente debemos ayudar a superar.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3704.757s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: Gracias.
 Entonces supongo que haré mi otra pregunta, veo que hay proyectos relacionados con los baños.
 Nuevamente, este es mi cuarto año y este es el cuarto año en el que los estudiantes están haciendo el arduo trabajo de descubrir cómo hacer llegar productos menstruales a nuestros estudiantes.
 Es vergonzoso.
 Sé que no todos en esta reunión necesariamente están de acuerdo, pero es vergonzoso.
 Cuatro años consecutivos, hay proyectos CCSR para garantizar que las estudiantes que están menstruando no tengan problemas para acceder a estos productos.
 Es simplemente un poco alucinante.
 Y sólo quiero dejar claro que no votaré por ningún
 reformas de baños si no incluyen dosificadores gratuitos de productos menstruales en cada baño reformado.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3762.382s">[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>: ¿Dr. Édouard-Vincent?
 Sólo quiero comentar, diputado Ruseau, que cuando haga
 Las declaraciones harán que la gente crea que cuando las estudiantes usan los baños y no tienen acceso a productos femeninos en la escuela secundaria, tenemos una sala médica completa.
 Los productos femeninos se colocan en los baños, pero desafortunadamente, a veces los productos femeninos no se usan para su propósito adecuado.
 Se usan, se decoran en los baños, terminan en los techos.
 Eso también ha sucedido varias veces.
 Y eso es con personas que supervisan y monitorean los baños.
 Entonces los ponemos allí, estudiantes de CCSR,
 Asumo eso como un proyecto, pero quiero que la gente sepa que hay productos femeninos disponibles en la sala médica y que a los estudiantes no se les niega el acceso.
 Contamos con una amplia gama de productos en el conjunto médico y no me opongo a conseguir máquinas a las que los estudiantes puedan tener acceso, pero sólo quiero señalar que cuando las proporcionamos, no se utilizaron para el propósito adecuado.
 lo cual fue parte de la razón por la que terminaron siendo eliminados en el pasado.
 Entonces solo quiero decir que no estamos tratando de dirigirnos a los estudiantes o decirles que, ya sabes, no está disponible.
 Quiero que todos sepan que está disponible y que hay suficientes suministros en la sala médica de la escuela secundaria en particular, y también en las escuelas intermedias.
 Está disponible en todas las consultas de enfermería.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3866.52s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: Gracias.
 Si pudiera responder rápidamente, alcalde.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3869.988s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Sí, y luego el miembro Kreatz.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3872.29s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: Sí, lo entiendo.
 Y nunca sugeriría ni por un segundo que alguien esté tratando de negar estas cosas.
 Simplemente sugeriría que consigamos un mapa de la escuela secundaria e imaginemos a un estudiante que está en el punto más alejado de la sala médica.
 Y quiero decir, de los miembros del comité escolar, soy el único aquí
 No ha tenido estas experiencias.
 Solo estoy haciendo suposiciones sobre todos ustedes, pero, ya saben, ni siquiera yo puedo imaginarme estar tan lejos de la sala médica como ustedes pueden estar en este edificio que es simplemente enorme y que me digan, ya saben dónde está.
 Caminé por ese edificio para llegar a lo que sea.
 Y yo digo, en primer lugar, que no es una caminata de dos minutos.
 Estamos hablando, quiero decir, ni siquiera sé cuál es el momento, pero creo que,
 el listón de lo que consideramos acceso parece ser muy, muy bajo o alto, cualquiera que sea la analogía correcta.
 Y yo, ya sabes, hay otros distritos que han hecho esto y yo no, no aparecen en la portada del mundo como un gran problema.
 Y entiendo que, ya sabes, lo que he leído sobre, ya sabes, la salud, no es la Ley de Juventud Saludable, olvidé qué ley fue la que realmente requeriría esto en las escuelas el año pasado,
 Pero hay una situación inicial como, cuando los instalas por primera vez y los pones a disposición de forma gratuita, quedarán pegados al techo y los niños que los necesiten podrían llevarse a casa cestas llenas de ellos.
 Pero como ocurre con muchas cosas, se aburrirán.
 Y luego, cuando los estudiantes los necesiten, estarán ahí.
 Así que no pretendo que sea un proyecto sin esfuerzo.
 Simplemente creo firmemente que
 El CCSR, creo que fue un proyecto del CCSR, y llegó a mi bandeja de entrada en Facebook, creo que hace una semana, sobre estudiantes que están haciendo esto.
 No están haciendo esto porque no tienen nada más que hacer.
 Entonces creo que no estamos escuchando a los estudiantes.
 Estoy mirando la página de CCSR de 2016 y ese es uno de sus proyectos de ese año.
 Y no sé cuándo llegaremos a eso, pero gracias.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4012.217s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Gracias, miembro crest y miembro de Graham, miembro McLaughlin.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4015.74s">[Kathy Kreatz]</a>: Sí, sólo quería agradecer.
 En primer lugar, solo tengo una pregunta sobre el transporte, pero antes que nada solo quería que todos supieran que las presentaciones fueron excelentes y que, Sr. McLaughlin, hizo un gran trabajo y cuáles serán esos puntos de la agenda.
 Estará en la agenda de la próxima semana para que podamos tener una discusión la próxima semana en la reunión del subcomité.
 Entonces la pregunta que tengo también es sobre el transporte.
 Un par de cosas sobre eso porque abrí el boletín porque no recuerdo que estuviera en un radio de una milla.
 Entonces leí el boletín sobre transporte durante Kobe 2021, y dice aquí que todas las escuelas públicas no transportarán a los estudiantes en una escuela amarilla, cualquiera que sea su dirección física dentro de dos millas de la escuela a la que asisten.
 Entendemos que este cambio supone una carga importante y siempre hemos proporcionado transporte que supera la regulación.
 Así que ni siquiera estoy seguro de tener la información correcta.
 Sr. Murphy, lo que mencionó, tampoco tengo esa información.
 No recuerdo haber tenido una reunión sobre eso.
 Así que sólo quería mencionar eso.
 Conozco a la Sra.
 Van der Kloot habló de eso.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4092.141s">[David Murphy]</a>: Señor, solo intento aclarar.
 Y digo esto con el tipo de descargo de responsabilidad que esto era antes de que yo estuviera aquí, pero he estado involucrado en esto desde entonces.
 Y si alguno, si alguno de mis colegas quiere compartir sus recuerdos, por favor no lo haga.
 Pero como me explicaron, fue que cuando al comité se le presentó el radio de 2,0 millas,
 Yo tenía entendido que eso era para los grados de secundaria.
 Existía una restricción ya que nuevamente, como a mí, creo que me dijeron de una milla en el nivel elemental que esencialmente no se había aplicado.
 Y que, para reducir el número total de personas que viajan en autobús, sería necesario informar al proveedor que imponga ese radio de una milla en el nivel de primaria y dos millas en el nivel de secundaria.
 Eh, el.
 El número de personas que viajan en el autobús ha disminuido tan significativamente que, francamente, no está claro si el proveedor necesitaba hacer cumplir el radio de una milla.
 Y esto, por cierto, debo decir, tampoco se aplica al jardín de infantes.
 Entonces, las excepciones son las exenciones de seguridad para el jardín de infantes y los estudiantes con discapacidades, como ocurre con el transporte como parte del IEP, por supuesto, tampoco están relacionados con esta conversación.
 Pero los radios de una y dos millas, uno se basó en la restricción de COVID y el otro fue
 Básicamente, es una restricción no aplicada que, francamente, no es raro tener en los distritos, especialmente cuando hay espacio en el autobús.
 Y eso es lo que abordaríamos este verano en términos de planificación de rutas y paradas con el proveedor en ese radio.
 Y el proveedor ha advertido que si hiciéramos eso, probablemente tendríamos dentro de los 18 autobuses que contempla el contrato.
 que se aprobó el año pasado, lo más probable es que solo necesitemos una flota de 17 autobuses, y eso dejaría libre el 18 para potencialmente un segundo autobús en la escuela secundaria.
 Entonces creo, Dr. Cushing, lo vi levantar la mano.
 Si me equivoqué en algo, no dude en corregirme.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4219.238s">[Peter Cushing]</a>: No hablaste mal.
 Hablaste con mucha precisión.
 Supongo que si se pudiera decir que uno de los aspectos positivos de la pandemia fue que realmente fortaleció la relación entre los directores de las escuelas,
 Y pido disculpas por la persona a nivel de la ciudad y los padres que no mencionan su nombre, pero trabajar realmente en rutas seguras a la escuela como una forma de reducir también nuestra huella de combustibles fósiles con la cantidad de autobuses que paran y arrancan y mediante la creación de autobuses escolares ambulantes, formas seguras para que los estudiantes caminen hacia y desde la escuela.
 y buscar otras formas de asegurarnos de que brindábamos oportunidades seguras para que los niños llegaran a la escuela y al mismo tiempo darnos cuenta de que, si bien se trataba de un problema impulsado por la pandemia, había otros problemas relacionados con los combustibles fósiles, el tráfico y la congestión y cosas por el estilo que también influyeron en las consideraciones cuando tuvimos estas conversaciones el año pasado, que yo diría, todos nuestros directores de escuelas en los niveles de primaria y secundaria.
 se reunieron con personas para trazar rutas a sus escuelas.
 Obtuvimos datos cartográficos SIG con el lugar donde estaban todos nuestros estudiantes.
 Hicimos un análisis bastante completo para analizar realmente todo esto cuando llegamos a la pandemia y luego analizamos las oportunidades que podrían existir al surgir de la pandemia para cambiar los hábitos y la mentalidad.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4309.15s">[Kathy Kreatz]</a>: Gracias.
 Gracias.
 Solo tengo una pregunta más y podría ser información de salud para el próximo año escolar.
 Y Sr. Murphy, no estoy seguro de si estuvo presente todavía, pero Patterson estaba al tanto de ello.
 Porque regresamos a la escuela antes del Día del Trabajo, y con la MBTA, los días previos al Día del Trabajo, la MBTA no opera para los estudiantes de secundaria, por lo que siempre ha habido preocupación.
 Durante los primeros días antes del Día del Trabajo, cuando los niños regresan a la escuela.
 Yo, ya sabes, solíamos recibir mensajes de que los estudiantes estaban esperando en la parada del autobús y el autobús no estaba allí.
 Terminaron caminando y llegaron tarde a la escuela.
 Entonces, en preparación para el próximo año escolar.
 Se ha agregado un autobús escolar amarillo que recorre algunas de las paradas más frecuentes para recoger a los estudiantes de secundaria durante los primeros días.
 Así que no puedo recordar todos los detalles, pero solo quería informarles sobre eso, que ha sido un problema constante.
 cada año porque comenzamos antes del Día del Trabajo.
 Y luego, justo después del Día del Trabajo, los autobuses MBT funcionarán según el horario escolar regular.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4398.254s">[David Murphy]</a>: Sra.
 Kreatz, realmente lo aprecio.
 No es algo con lo que esté familiarizado.
 Me educaré lo más rápido posible.
 Mi primera pregunta es ¿qué pasa con ese autobús después del Día del Trabajo?
 Porque si está disponible esa semana, tendría un poco de curiosidad sobre cómo o por qué estaría disponible.
 Yo diría en respuesta a eso,</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4416.775s">[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>: Es una práctica pasada en Medford, y Eastern Bus Company lo sabe porque comenzamos la escuela antes que muchos distritos circundantes, por lo que lo hacen y pueden barajar sus autobuses para ayudarnos a pasar los tres días iniciales antes de que otros distritos terminen comenzando.
 Así que han podido hacerlo y es algo de lo que están conscientes y definitivamente continuaremos con esa práctica, miembro Kreatz.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4444.807s">[David Murphy]</a>: Gracias.
 Sí, creo que ciertamente continuaremos practicando, pero también, en nuestras reuniones con Eastern Bus, creo que también presionaremos sobre el tema de cuál es la capacidad, porque el sentimiento que escuché del comité cuando discutimos esto el 26 de abril fue que si había una forma rentable de proporcionar transporte adicional en autobús amarillo para la escuela secundaria, entonces eso es algo que deberíamos considerar.
 Entonces, pero esto es, nuevamente, vamos a tener muchas conversaciones y han sido un muy buen socio.
 muy receptivo durante el transcurso del año pasado.
 Así que mi esperanza es que podamos continuar ese diálogo con ellos.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4480.762s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Gracias.</p>

 Gracias.
 Realmente aprecié la atención al desarrollo profesional que se estableció en las recomendaciones del superintendente y ciertamente los modelos de capacitación de capacitadores pueden ser realmente efectivos siempre y cuando exista un plan de sostenibilidad que venga con la capacitación de capacitadores y no sea un
 una puesta en marcha inicial que en cierto modo fracasa porque comenzar de nuevo en un tren, el plan del entrenador es muy costoso, así que solo quiero asegurarme de que tengamos planes de sostenibilidad implementados para realmente maximizar esa inversión.
 Sobre el tema del transporte, me gustaría hacer una moción para que el presupuesto incluya o asuma que no habrá ningún costo de transporte para nuestros estudiantes a partir del comienzo del año escolar 21-22.
 Y que la administración nos traerá un plan integral que establece una recomendación sobre el transporte para el distrito desde ahora hasta el 1 de agosto.
 Y la razón por la que agregué eso al final es porque
 He escuchado abrumadoramente de la gente que los niños que toman el autobús MBTA significa que a menudo llegan tarde y que no es confiable, y que los padres están haciendo otros arreglos para llevar a sus hijos a la escuela porque no sienten que puedan confiar en los autobuses MBTA.
 La idea de que todavía hay otros estudiantes que realmente dependen de esos pases de autobús MBTA para poder
 poder trabajar y viajar en autobús de una manera diferente no es algo que haya escuchado personalmente, pero no quiero descartar el hecho de que hay miembros de la comunidad que están en esa posición.
 Así que me gustaría que volviéramos a abordar el transporte y que todos ustedes trabajaran con Eastern Bus y el departamento de policía y quien sea.
 y, con suerte, la comunidad descubrirá cuál es el mejor camino a seguir.
 También le diré, Dr. Cushing, que recuerdo la conversación sobre el radio de una o dos millas y cosas similares sobre la no aplicación del radio en el nivel de la escuela primaria.
 Cuando el Sr. Murphy hablaba de que el jardín de infantes era una excepción, supongo que comencé a pensar que si se hiciera cumplir así,
 una milla versus dos millas o lo que sea.
 Y, sin embargo, todavía tienes que recoger a los niños de jardín de infantes en un lugar donde antes no lo harías.
 ¿Cómo, práctica o tácticamente, solo recoges a niños de kindergarten en ese radio más cercano?
 Entonces siento que hay mucha conversación sobre el transporte para hacerlo bien.
 Pero quiero que el presupuesto refleje inequívocamente que a los estudiantes no les costará ir a la escuela el próximo año, punto.
 ¿Le gustaría pasar lista o debería hacer mis otras preguntas?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4679.808s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Solo quiero, tú quieres eso, simplemente no sé qué pondrá el administrador en el presupuesto si no necesitan darnos ese plan hasta el 1 de agosto.
 Así que sólo quiero asegurarme de que quede claro para la administración y el equipo de finanzas.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4694.075s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Voy a suponer que el equipo de finanzas puede resolverlo desde ahora hasta el momento en que se nos presente el presupuesto final.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4699.617s">[David Murphy]</a>: Bueno, creo que lo único que diría, Merrick,
 es que entiendo que la moción significa que no queremos que ningún estudiante dependa de un pase MBTA que tenga que comprar con su propio dinero para ir a la escuela.
 Ahora, creo que hay diferentes maneras en que podemos explorar eso.
 Creo que la forma más rentable será con un autobús amarillo adicional, al menos un autobús amarillo adicional.
 Y como dije, eso podría ser sin costo alguno.
 En teoría, eso podría ser neutral desde el punto de vista presupuestario.
 Creo que más allá de eso, podría haber más de un autobús amarillo, y luego podría haber cualquier cosa más allá de un autobús que ciertamente tendrá algún tipo de impacto presupuestario.
 Y luego creo que el otro tema que tenemos que abordar es que habrá estudiantes que querrán el pase MBTA con descuento.
 No acepto la moción para sugerir que debamos descontinuar nuestra asociación con MBTA y dejar de ofrecer pases de MBTA porque si hay estudiantes que quieren comprar el pase por cualquier motivo,
 Ciertamente queremos que nuestros estudiantes puedan obtener un pase con descuento de la misma manera que lo pueden hacer los estudiantes de otros distritos escolares.
 Así que creo que continuaremos con el programa, pero creo que simplemente necesitaremos examinar esencialmente cuál es el uso del pase entre los estudiantes.
 Y luego, si dependen de eso, debemos cubrir el costo del pase MBTA o crear una opción alternativa para que los estudiantes lleguen a la escuela.
 Ahora creo que
 Todo esto se reduce a cuántos pases estamos vendiendo y cuántos estudiantes que los compran dependen de ellos.
 ¿Y entonces cuál sería la ruta de un autobús amarillo?
 Ciertamente hay capas para eso, pero ciertamente hay una dirección clara del comité.
 Si nos topamos con un problema en términos de ejecución, ya sea desde una perspectiva presupuestaria o logística, regresaremos.
 Para mí es concebible que pueda haber un grupo de estudiantes
 cuando decimos, bueno, estás comprando este pase porque lo necesitas para ir a la escuela, porque necesitas ir a trabajar, porque solo quieres un pase MBTA con descuento.
 Y van a decir, escucha, amigo, sólo quiero el pase.
 Aquí están mis 30 dólares.
 Me preocuparé por llegar a la escuela.
 En ese punto, no creo que estemos violando la política.
 Creo que nos encontramos con un estudiante que ha decidido que quiere llevar el MBTA a la escuela, ya sea que llegue a tiempo o no.
 Una vez más, creo que la intención es muy, muy clara.
 Y creo que haremos todo lo posible para ejecutarlo.
 Tendremos que mantener un diálogo abierto con la comisión si nos encontramos en una situación en la que, ya sea desde una perspectiva presupuestaria o simplemente a nivel de ejecución, simplemente no es posible.
 Pero ciertamente entiendo la intención.
 Y como dije, haremos nuestro mejor esfuerzo para actuar de manera consistente con ello.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4879.947s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Entonces, ¿cómo quiere que se redacte la resolución?
 Miembro Graham y Sr. Murphy, para que podamos tener una idea de lo que veremos antes del 1 de junio en lugar del 1 de agosto.
 Pensé que estaba claro.
 Bueno, mencionaste la fecha del 1 de agosto, y solo quiero saber qué estoy apoyando y qué se proporcionará y cuándo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4905.178s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: De modo que el presupuesto incluirá el supuesto de que no cuesta dinero ir a la escuela.
 Y el plan y la estrategia de transporte revisados ​​no es algo que pueda hacerse razonablemente antes de que eso suceda.
 Entonces eso es lo que tomaría hasta el 1 de agosto.
 Al igual que los detalles, ¿es que los pases MBTA son gratuitos para todos o es la estrategia de que hay un autobús amarillo y es la estrategia que estamos cambiando?
 radio de una milla a dos millas, todo eso obviamente tiene implicaciones presupuestarias al igual que literalmente todo lo que sucede en el distrito después de que aprobamos el presupuesto.
 Pero el presupuesto debe reflejar una capacidad de costos que nos permita no exigir a los estudiantes que paguen para venir a la escuela.
 ¿Está claro, señor Murphy?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4960.204s">[David Murphy]</a>: Sí, quiero decir, supongo que la única advertencia, realmente no estoy tratando de ser quisquilloso con esto, es que no creo que en este momento exijamos que nadie pague dinero para venir a la escuela.
 En realidad, algunos estudiantes están tomando el autobús MBTA y, en teoría, nuestra falta de capacidad de autobuses amarillos en la escuela secundaria lo requiere según el lugar donde viven o la situación familiar o lo que sea.
 Y entonces, en la práctica, pagan para ir a la escuela, pero no es que la política del distrito diga que no te dejamos entrar a menos que te presentes en un autobús MBTA por el que pagas.
 Entonces, creo que uno, creo que querríamos recopilar datos de la población actual de estudiantes, con suerte también mirar hacia atrás durante un período de años, ver cuántos pases MBTA estamos vendiendo y asumir que eso es un límite en términos de lo que tendríamos que proporcionar.
 Y luego creo que veremos si reducimos eso desde una perspectiva de costos agregando capacidad de autobús amarillo.
 Y luego pienso que mientras vendemos los pases MBTA, porque como comentamos anteriormente, no queremos impedir que nuestros estudiantes obtengan los pases con descuento.
 Entonces creo que tenemos que recopilar datos sobre cuáles son los pases.
 ¿Los pases se utilizan en función de una preferencia o se compran más bien en función de la preferencia o de la falta de
 otras formas de llegar a la escuela.
 Entonces creo que la intención es muy clara.
 Como dije, lo ejecutaremos de acuerdo con esto y simplemente tendremos que regresar si nos encontramos con un obstáculo logístico o si se convierte en algo que parece imposible.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5068.707s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: Sobre esta moción, gracias.
 Yo solo, para aclarar,
 perspectiva, me gustaría simplemente, supongo, hacer una especie de aclaración si existe tal cosa, pero el problema desde hace mucho tiempo ha sido que tenemos estudiantes que pagan para mantener la escuela, muchos de los cuales están en desventaja económica, y que están
 potencialmente en un radio de dos millas, o al menos en un radio de dos millas.
 Y si piensa incluso en la cúspide del radio de dos millas, que sería, digamos, por ejemplo, estudiantes en, ya sabes, las cercanías de McGlynn, las cercanías de la Escuela Secundaria McGlynn, caminando hasta la escuela secundaria o para tenerla porque no podían permitírselo o tener que elegir, ya sabes, pagar $30 al mes por el pase reducido que podría afectar mucho a sus familias.
 Creo que es solo
 un valor ético es una declaración es un nuestro presupuesto refleja cuáles son nuestros valores y creo que me ha sorprendido que ese haya sido el caso en la historia, incluso sentado en el comité escolar al otro lado del podio que los estudiantes tenían que pagar.
 transportarse a la escuela y, especialmente, habiendo sido un estudiante que no habría podido hacer eso, entonces piensas en cuáles son las tasas de ausentismo, cuáles son las tasas de hambre, lo que sabes, hay tantos, hay tantos impactos, entonces esa moción sabría que preferiría que fueran los pases de MBTA, pero diferiría al comité de finanzas para que lo haga y nos brinde una
 Análisis de costo-beneficio que podemos analizar un poco más incluso, ya sabes, en la próxima sesión o en la sesión final mientras evaluamos esto.
 Pero me gustaría presentar la pregunta y apoyo la moción del miembro Graham.</p>

 Debería haber planteado esta pregunta antes de que se trasladara, pero solo quiero hacer una pregunta aclaratoria más.
 Si existe la moción que contempla el radio de dos millas en el nivel secundario, porque según la política existente, a esos estudiantes no se les proporcionaría un autobús amarillo, incluso si hubiéramos descargado los autobuses amarillos.
 Pero yo, no sé, no sé qué haría un pase MBTA, pero si un estudiante vive a un cuarto de milla de la escuela, la expectativa es que aún así nos aseguraremos de que haya transporte gratuito para ese estudiante, aunque
 ¿Algo así como la política les contempla caminar a la escuela?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5248.902s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: No, quiero decir, si la ley contempla que los estudiantes caminen a la escuela, estoy de acuerdo con que siga siendo la práctica.
 No estoy pidiendo que mordamos personalmente ese trozo de manzana ahora mismo.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5273.365s">[David Murphy]</a>: Si estás, si estás a más de dos millas de la escuela y a ambos lados de, ya sabes, fuera del radio de la escuela secundaria, y uno está comenzando a tomar un autobús amarillo gratuito, y a otro le dicen que tiene que pagar $30 al mes por un pase MBTA.
 Eso es indignante.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5288.911s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Sí.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5289.571s">[David Murphy]</a>: Y si eso es lo que buscamos abordar, creo que es sensato.
 Es algo que podemos mirar.
 la ley,
 Para que quede claro, nadie mayor de sexto grado tiene derecho a transporte.
 Y por eso la ley está vigente para aplicar la política existente en un radio de dos millas, que es casi uniforme en toda la Commonwealth.
 Eso tiene sentido y podemos hacerlo.
 Pero mientras lo estemos, su respuesta me dice que todos estamos de acuerdo en cuál es la desigualdad, eso es lo que buscamos abordar.
 y elaboraremos un plan coherente con la votación para hacerlo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5326.754s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: ¿Puedo hacer un comentario sobre la información, porque no estoy seguro de que tengamos claro qué, al menos lo que sentí que se estaba discutiendo también, y quiero claridad?

 Creo que mi problema específicamente era que los estudiantes económicamente desfavorecidos tuvieran que pagar
 transporte a la escuela.
 Y entonces, ya sea que esté dentro del radio de dos millas o, ya sabes, supongo que el radio de dos millas es, ya sabes, o un radio de una milla o lo que sea que estemos ofreciendo.
 Sé que en el pasado los profesores pagaban para que los estudiantes tuvieran acceso a MBTA.
 pases de transporte.
 Y entonces, a su punto, Sr. Murphy, y esto es algo que puede ser objeto de mayor consideración, no necesariamente para esta moción o adición en particular, usted sabe que las mociones han sido aprobadas, pero a su punto de que esto permite que los pases MBTA permitan la accesibilidad en la ciudad, pueden permitir el aula en la ciudad, pueden permitir oportunidades laborales,
 pueden permitir el transporte a la escuela.
 Y el subconjunto más importante que me preocupa: ¿vas a hacer una pregunta?
 Sí.
 ¿Estamos centrados en los económicamente desfavorecidos en esta consideración?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5405.854s">[David Murphy]</a>: Bueno, creo que la moción... creo que es de todos.
 Sí, creo que son todos.
 Sí, es más amplio que los económicamente desfavorecidos, pero no incluye a los estudiantes dentro del radio de dos millas.
 Eso nos da un punto de datos para comenzar y
 similar a lo que el Dr. Grisham estaba diciendo antes sobre el uso del GPS para identificar desde una perspectiva de gráficos de datos, ya sabes, podemos decir, está bien, esta es nuestra población de estudiantes que tenemos que asegurarnos de que lleguen a la escuela de forma gratuita.
 Y podría darse el caso de que, similar a lo que aparentemente hacemos antes del Día del Trabajo, si simplemente ponemos un autobús en la sala, podamos acomodar a una gran parte de esos estudiantes.
 Y si somos capaces de hacer eso, entonces creo que podría resultar una directiva bastante sencilla de cumplir.
 Si lo miramos y decimos, bueno, ese autobús que usamos antes del Día del Trabajo solo atiende al 15% de los estudiantes.
 Y para poder atender las diversas áreas de la comunidad, necesitamos seis autobuses nuevos.
 Entonces tal vez tengamos que regresar y decir: vamos a tener que reconstruir esto de alguna otra manera porque no tenemos una forma sostenible de hacerlo en este momento.
 Y luego, en ese punto, es posible que tengamos que reducir en quién nos estamos enfocando a las desventajas económicas porque la Sra.
 estaba diciendo McLaughlin.
 Nuevamente, no sé exactamente cómo resultará esto, pero creo que tenemos una dirección clara y estamos felices de seguir adelante.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5523.442s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Y así es, pero aquí no se pide abordar eso.
 ¿Porqué es eso?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5527.325s">[David Murphy]</a>: Porque en el comité recordarán que lo que se defendió para el año fiscal 21 era esencialmente una capacidad de dos puestos.
 Lo que buscamos para cumplir con eso fue, primero, con la asignación del Capítulo 70, agregamos el puesto de contralor.
 Esa es la Sra.
 Kingdon, quien ha contribuido decisivamente a que parezca menos tonto de lo que sería normalmente semana tras semana.
 También aporta capacidad y experiencia contable que no cubrieron en la facultad de derecho, lo cual estoy agradecido.
 Además de eso,
 Reutilizamos un puesto de asistente ejecutivo que había evolucionado hasta convertirse en un rol de coordinador de subvenciones y lo reposicionamos en la oficina de finanzas como coordinador de subvenciones.
 Y por eso hemos ampliado nuestra capacidad hasta ese punto.
 Verán que es, bueno, en sus tablas salariales, el asistente ejecutivo, el reemplazo del puesto de asistente ejecutivo, y solo, lo siento, para terminar con eso,
 Todo eso se hizo durante el año fiscal 21.
 El presupuesto neutral para el coordinador de subvenciones en esto llegó nuevamente a través de la asignación del capítulo 70 que se realizó en agosto.
 Eso amplió nuestra capacidad y nos ha posicionado mejor para poder servir al distrito.
 La única prioridad que permanece en la narrativa del presupuesto de finanzas y operaciones reside en las tablas salariales.
 que son en todo el distrito, con los cuales debería hablar antes de nosotros, solo para que quede claro cuál es la tabla salarial en todo el distrito, ese puesto de asistente ejecutivo que actualmente apoya a dos de los superintendentes asistentes cuando se reponga apoyará a los tres superintendentes asistentes y, por lo tanto, agregará capacidad a la oficina de finanzas en ese sentido también.
 Entonces, en efecto, tendremos,
 Una vez más, no pretendemos inflar la oficina de finanzas.
 Me escucharon decir anoche que las prioridades presupuestarias que se han desarrollado como parte del presupuesto aplicado 22 están impulsadas por lo que tendrá el apoyo más directo para los estudiantes.
 Y ciertamente puedo entender cómo quienes trabajan en comunidades escolares sugerirían que la oficina de finanzas y operaciones no es necesariamente la más cercana a los niños.
 Pero para que podamos servir bien al distrito y beneficiar a los niños, necesitamos contar con el personal adecuado.
 Al agregar el puesto de coordinador de subvenciones, el puesto de contralor y una parte del puesto de asistente ejecutivo, creemos que estaremos mejor posicionados para hacerlo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5687.179s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Gracias por eso.
 Y luego mi comentario final es simplemente decir que no estoy a favor de gastar
 fondos de capital para proyectos de rehabilitación de baños o el Teatro Karen o la entrada hasta que haya un plan maestro real que aborde las necesidades a largo plazo de la escuela secundaria.
 Es mucho dinero.
 Es como un cuarto de millón de dólares en total, y no es intrascendente cuando hablamos,
 como 10 profesionales del poder, muchos, muchos maestros, personal que no podemos incluir en el presupuesto.
 Hay muchas otras prioridades además de gastar sin tener un plan claro para el edificio.
 Ya lo he dicho antes, pero la prioridad de tener un plan claro para ese edificio es de vital importancia.
 Y hasta que eso suceda, no puedo apoyar el gasto de los dólares de la comunidad de una manera que nos encasille o nos ate las manos cuando se trata de las mayores necesidades de ese edificio, que aún no están evaluadas.
 Gracias.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5768.462s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Hasta ese punto, si pudiera señalar que los más de 800.000 y los 100.000 de la caldera y los laboratorios de ciencias tienen que destinarse a proyectos de capital.
 Así que creo que hay muchos.
 Y la escuela secundaria necesita mucha atención y un comité de visión y el trabajo que haríamos tardará años.
 Entonces, quiero decir, respetuosamente no estoy de acuerdo.
 Quería señalar eso.
 Miembro McLaughlin.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5796.765s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: Gracias.
 Tengo algunas preguntas.
 Supongo que empezaré con ese ya que ese fue el último tema de la conversación.
 Supongo que me gustaría que en la próxima agenda se incluya el comité de visión de MHS para que podamos entender cuál es el estado de este cuando estamos considerando gastar dinero.
 Simplemente no quiero tirar, ya sabes, buen dinero tras mal.
 Ha habido mucha discusión sobre la escuela secundaria y no hemos convocado al comité de visión.
 Me gustaría que eso se incluyera en la próxima agenda, por favor.
 Y luego, volviendo al transporte, ¿el presidente iba a preguntarle al Sr. Murphy qué quiso decir con vincular oportunidades programáticas a sus adquisiciones?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5840.763s">[David Murphy]</a>: ¿Está eso en uno de los documentos?
 La adquisición de lo que es sólo un poco más de contexto.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5847.308s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: No lo sé, no entendí de qué estabas hablando.
 Estabas hablando de transporte y lo siento, pero cité lo que decías.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5854.951s">[David Murphy]</a>: Lo siento, creo que estábamos hablando de los pases MBTA.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5857.612s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: Sí.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5858.012s">[David Murphy]</a>: Y lo que estaba diciendo, y creo que usted hizo un comentario similar, Sra.
 McLaughlin, que los pases MBTA son una buena inversión para que los estudiantes vayan a la escuela.
 Son una gran inversión si existe un nexo entre la adquisición de los pases MBTA.
 Oportunidades programáticas y de instrucción que colocan a los estudiantes en la comunidad y les brindan oportunidades de aprendizaje experiencial.
 Y como no lo sé, y ciertamente hay muchos maestros y CCR, CCSR es un gran ejemplo de ello, pero hay muchas oportunidades de instrucción en la escuela secundaria que se infiltran en la comunidad y en el tipo de mundo educativo en general más allá de las paredes del aula.
 Pero si vamos a aumentar nuestra inversión
 e invertir en pases MBTA, entonces me parece que podríamos maximizar esa inversión si lo hacemos y pensamos también a través de una lente de instrucción, y tratamos de expandir nuestras oportunidades de aprendizaje experiencial, lo cual, creo en mi opinión, al menos es un bien en sí mismo, pero se magnifica cuando también brindamos ese tipo de recurso para hacerlo más accesible para los estudiantes.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5931.149s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: Gracias.
 Pensé que eso era lo que quería decir y quería una aclaración porque me estoy imaginando, por ejemplo, estudiantes vocacionales transportándose a su sitio, voluntarios de CCSR, y todo ese tipo de cosas.
 Por lo tanto, sería interesante saber cuáles son las oportunidades programáticas mientras consideramos este análisis de costos para estas diferentes opciones.
 Y luego sé que no solo tenemos autobuses de Eastern, sino también nuestros proveedores de transporte.
 Tenemos varios proveedores de transporte y ha habido varios problemas entre ellos.
 Personalmente hemos tenido algunos problemas con los proveedores de transporte y sé que es difícil mantener o retener al personal.
 especialmente en las circunstancias actuales.
 Pero me pregunto acerca de una oportunidad centralizada o casi como una solución C-click, ya sabes, una especie de opción o, ya sabes, una línea de quejas o algo donde podamos recopilar datos sobre lo que realmente está sucediendo en la comunidad con respecto a nuestro transporte, porque estamos pagando mucho dinero a nuestros proveedores, y siento que no hay responsabilidad ante los proveedores.
 No hay ningún tipo de coherencia en torno a lo que ofrecen los proveedores, e incluso en algunos de los contratos que he visto
 Los padres llegan a casa con cartas que dicen que si pierdes el autobús por la mañana, no te recogerán por la tarde, lo cual es una completa violación, ¿verdad?
 No puedes hacer eso.
 Pero esto es para el transporte de educación especial, por ejemplo.
 Pero esa fue una carta que vimos específicamente.
 Entonces esto es lo que estoy diciendo.
 Tiene que haber cierta coherencia en torno a los contratos, a los presupuestos, pero también al tipo de proceso de reclamación.
 porque si
 un administrador escucha quejas sobre una sección y otro escucha otra, como quién está centralizando estas quejas para que nosotros, como comité escolar, entendamos cuáles son las ofertas de estos proveedores y si son razonables.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6050.083s">[David Murphy]</a>: No, le agradezco que haya planteado eso, Sra.
 McLaughlin y yo, como dije al comienzo de la presentación, esta es una de las razones clave por las que hemos querido reorganizarnos para tener una persona clave comprometida con la familia.
 Y eso no quiere decir que una vez que tengamos un director de participación familiar, ya sabes, nunca habrá quejas o nunca habrá quejas que no tengan la respuesta inmediata y sustantiva que preferiríamos porque la naturaleza de una organización grande es que a veces algo va a suceder y en realidad no nos enteramos hasta algún tiempo después.
 Y a veces vamos a oír hablar de ello, pero habrá un conflicto
 ya sabes, una historia sobre lo que realmente ocurrió.
 Así que no quiero sugerir que a través de esa reorganización de esas oficinas, de alguna manera nunca habrá problemas adicionales, porque, ya saben, esa es la realidad.
 Sin embargo, al mismo tiempo, imaginamos que la Oficina de Participación Familiar actuará de muchas maneras como facilitadora central entre las oficinas que tienen el contacto más directo y más frecuente.
 con las familias, y esos son algunos de los programas de cuidado antes y después de la escuela, el proceso de inscripción cuando ingresas por primera vez a la comunidad escolar, los servicios de salud, donde a menudo la comunicación con las familias depende literalmente de la vida, y la educación especial ciertamente, y el transporte es una gran parte de eso, porque por mucho que interactuemos con las familias y los padres en el ámbito de la instrucción,
 Algunas de esas cuestiones logísticas operativas básicas son para las que las familias dependen más del distrito, y tener esas oficinas como los radios de una rueda, por así decirlo, creo que ayudará desde una perspectiva de comunicación y garantizará que los administradores que necesitan estar informados sobre algunas de estas cuestiones lo estén rápidamente.
 Así que el único punto en el que discreparía con respecto a sus comentarios, diputado McLaughlin,
 es la sugerencia de que no habría responsabilidad para ningún proveedor.
 Y la rendición de cuentas puede manifestarse de diversas maneras y, a veces, en distintos plazos.
 Pero diré que siempre que la administración y ciertamente la Sra.
 La oficina de Bowen en particular tiene conocimiento de estos problemas, los tomamos muy en serio y respondemos a ellos.
 Y si hay algún caso en el que los padres o cuidadores estén al tanto, en el que un proveedor no ha cumplido con sus responsabilidades para con los estudiantes del distrito o las familias del distrito, es algo que queremos saber de inmediato.
 Y ciertamente tenemos nuestro compromiso de que habrá una respuesta sólida en todo momento porque ciertamente la situación que usted describió, ya sabe, evacuar es completamente inaceptable y no es algo que toleraríamos.
 por nuestro propio personal o cualquier proveedor con el que estemos asociados.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6238.19s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: Gracias.
 Y si me lo permite, alcalde, para ser claro, el Director de Servicios Estudiantiles siempre ha sido increíblemente receptivo, pero yo también siempre he sido una rueda chirriante.
 Y pienso en las personas que no lo son y en cómo se les responde y en cómo pueden demostrar que el transporte está funcionando.
 Y, francamente, creo que se trata de la recopilación de datos.
 y los niños que llegan tarde a la escuela y algo así como eso.
 Pero, una vez más, creo que es importante mirar a nuestros proveedores.
 Y, por último, solo quería elogiar nuevamente la dirección del superintendente hacia un mayor desarrollo profesional y un desarrollo profesional específico, tanto en torno al sesgo implícito como al aprendizaje socioemocional.
 Y escuché del personal y de los miembros de la comunidad dos puntos sobre el desarrollo profesional que quería plantear.
 y uno es ese
 Creo que parte del personal especializado no necesariamente siente que existe un desarrollo profesional específico para, ya sabes, licencias o necesidades muy específicas, por lo que quería presentar eso y luego también
 Usted sabe, solo la preocupación por garantizar la participación y el desarrollo profesional de los paraprofesionales y eso está relacionado con los paraprofesionales y ciertamente parece que la pieza de aprendizaje socioemocional será parte de eso, pero quiero asegurarme de eso y sé que en el pasado creo que muchas veces los paraprofesionales han ido a donde van los maestros.
 Son profesores asociados, lo cual entiendo, ya conoces el razonamiento en torno a eso también.
 Pero creo que también sería bueno poder permitir que las personas tengan cierta flexibilidad y opciones para el desarrollo profesional.
 Así que esas no son cosas sobre las que espero respuesta esta noche, pero simplemente quería mencionarlas para que ustedes estén al tanto.
 Gracias.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6347.04s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Gracias.
 Gracias, miembros.
 Entonces el miembro Kreatz y luego el miembro Van der Kloot.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6353.346s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: Gracias, alcalde.
 Sé que ya pasamos la resolución sobre el plan de transporte.
 Tenía que caminar 1,1 millas hasta la parada de autobús todos los días mientras crecía.
 Y si perdía el autobús, tenía que caminar cuatro horas y 29 minutos para llegar a la escuela.
 Obviamente eso es un poco más grande que Medford.
 Entonces fueron 13 millas.
 Pero mi punto es mi experiencia de llegar al autobús o no ir a la escuela,
 Um, fue que si miraras mis ausencias, um, ya sabes, Massachusetts, probablemente tendría DCF en mi casa, francamente.
 Um, entonces, solo espero que cuando hagamos el plan, um, y estemos hablando de dos millas versus una milla, um, creo que, uh, esto se relaciona un poco con los niveles de personal del Sr. Murphy.
 Um, quiero conocer a nuestros hijos que están dentro del radio de dos millas.
 llegan tarde o se ausentan más que los niños que están fuera del radio de dos millas.
 Y en realidad no creo que tengas la capacidad de pasar por un año de fiestas y un año de ausencias y calcular la distancia desde la escuela y si usan el autobús o algo así, parece que es un trabajo pesado.
 Pero esa es una decisión política que estamos tomando sin tener idea del impacto en
 los resultados educativos porque, ya sabes, si siempre volvemos a eso, si no estás en la escuela, ciertamente no estás aprendiendo.
 Así que, ya sabes, mi propia experiencia de que llegas a la parada del autobús o no vas a la escuela, eso seguramente también sucede en Medford.
 Entonces, cuando hablamos de una milla versus dos millas, creo que también debemos reconocer que no solo hay un impacto financiero.
 Hay un impacto en todas las puntuaciones.
 A la superintendente realmente le gusta su puntaje MCAS, ya sabes, son métricas, le guste o no el MCAS, son métricas y eso es importante.
 Pero esta es una política específica que tendrá impacto en las métricas.
 Y no, quiero decir, no, no estoy pidiendo un informe, pero sé por experiencia propia que es absolutamente un hecho.
 Si pierdes el autobús, no vas a la escuela.
 Y claro, no podría caminar a la escuela si perdiera el autobús y no tuviera transporte, pero
 Estoy seguro de que hay muchos niños que, si perdieron el autobús, se joden.
 Pero para todos los niños que se encuentran bajo ese radio de dos millas, no hay autobús.
 Entonces, cuando llueve amarga, desagradable y fría, que solíamos tener antes de que el calentamiento global hiciera que todo alcanzara los 70 grados, esos días, si vas en autobús,
 diferente a si no vas a tomar el autobús y se espera que camines al menos 40 minutos para llegar a la escuela.
 Entonces no tengo una pregunta.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6537.591s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Simplemente estoy como... Gracias, miembros.

 Miembro Kreatz, si pudiera activar el silencio, por favor.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6554.746s">[Kathy Kreatz]</a>: Ah, está bien, ahí vamos.
 Sí, entonces, con respecto a la moción que hicimos esta noche, ¿será que el Sr. Murphy nos dará un informe que describirá cuáles serían los diversos costos, por ejemplo, si usaremos autobuses amarillos para todos los estudiantes del distrito o si consideraremos comprar pases de autobús MBTA para todos los estudiantes?
 ¿Será así una propuesta que estará lista para que la revisemos en el momento del presupuesto y podamos ver cómo encaja en el presupuesto?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6595.799s">[David Murphy]</a>: Creo que vamos a intentar crear un plan que no incluya que los estudiantes que se encuentran fuera de un radio de dos millas de la escuela secundaria dependan de pases MBTA que deben comprar.
 Cómo vamos a lograr eso, creo que vamos a necesitar un poco de tiempo para descubrirlo, pero solo digo, no debería especular sobre esto, pero solo les diré lo que mi instinto me dice es que tendrá que ser un plan multifacético en el que agregaremos capacidad de autobuses amarillos.
 Tenemos una cantidad X de pases MBTA para quienes el distrito está absorbiendo el costo y potencialmente explorando
 otras asociaciones para ayudar a sufragar ese costo general, y también tener en cuenta qué datos podemos recopilar para determinar la base para la adquisición de MBTA por parte de los estudiantes.
 Así que supongo que para hacer esto, tendremos que analizar cada una de esas palancas.
 Y creo que, según tengo entendido, creo que si sabemos antes del 1 de agosto que
 Esto no es algo que podamos hacer ni desde el punto de vista financiero ni desde el punto de vista logístico, lo informaremos al comité.
 Y yo, lo que imaginaría es informar al comité, no simplemente levantar las manos y decir, lo siento, no podemos hacerlo.
 Creo que lo que diríamos es, ya sabes, antes de que tuviéramos X cantidad de pases MBTA que se compraban con el propósito de llegar a la escuela bajo este plan, hemos podido reducir la cantidad de pases que anticipamos adquirir para la escuela en esta cantidad.
 Éstos son los obstáculos para eliminar el barco lleno de estudiantes que compran los pases.
 Y luego, en ese momento, a la Sra.
 McLaughlin, entonces podríamos analizar cómo potencialmente nos dirigimos a estudiantes de circunstancias económicamente desfavorecidas.
 Así que creo que es multifacético, pero como dije, la dirección es clara y tendremos que avanzar en esa dirección y haremos todo lo posible para que sea una realidad.</p>

 Inicialmente, justo después de las elecciones y las preocupaciones sobre la composición del comité, luego intervino la pandemia.
 Es vital que determinemos hacia dónde vamos a llegar con esto.
 ¿Vamos a elegir un comité completamente nuevo?
 Había gente que había expresado interés.
 En este punto, necesitamos establecer un comité porque entiendo las preocupaciones de Jenny.
 Y también quiero asegurarme de que el edificio sea habitable para los niños que están allí.
 Entonces creo que hay una
 Creo que hay un punto intermedio entre no hacerlo en absoluto y hacer algunas de las mejoras necesarias para mantener el edificio en un estado satisfactorio.
 forma mientras los estudiantes lo usan actualmente.
 Pero la clave para eso, más que nada, es que tenemos que determinar cuál será el comité de visión, qué les pediremos y cuál es el cronograma que imaginamos.
 Quizás no sea el momento de empezarlo a finales de junio.
 Lo entiendo.
 Pero debemos estar preparados para concentrarnos a principios de septiembre y no esperar a que pase otro año escolar.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6835.327s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Supongamos lo mismo, empecemos en el otoño, donde tenemos otras cosas, el presupuesto, la Escuela Columbus, recuperar a los niños.</p>

 Y quiero simplemente
 Digo que apoyo firmemente la renovación de algunos de los baños en el complejo de la escuela secundaria porque necesitan desesperadamente ser mejorados y renovados.
 Y estoy de acuerdo en que necesitamos trabajar en un plan más integral, pero los baños más modernos de todo el complejo están en el ala de ciencias.
 Y eso es para todo el complejo que cuenta con baños realmente modernos.
 Por eso no todos los estudiantes están ubicados en esa sección del edificio.
 Así que espero que parte de ese dinero que se asignó en 2019 y debido a la pandemia y todo lo que realmente necesitamos para seguir adelante con al menos la renovación y mejora de algunas de las
 algunas de esas instalaciones de baño.
 Creo que eso es de vital importancia.
 Y, ya sabes, solo estoy pensando en las necesidades de los estudiantes y diciendo que quiero que puedan tener baños actualizados y que funcionen.
 Así que sólo quería recordarle al comité el compromiso que se hizo cuando se nos entregó el dinero.</p>

 Miembro Graham y luego miembro Kreatz.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6974.25s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Sólo quería decir que estoy de acuerdo con el miembro Van der Kloot.
 De hecho, no se trata de oponernos a ninguno de esos proyectos, y tal vez todos tengan sentido, pero la falta de información en este momento nos está colocando en una posición en la que podríamos estar tomando decisiones para gastar cantidades sustanciales del dinero de la ciudad de una manera frívola o de una manera que haga más complicado
 hacer lo que hay que hacer cuando realmente hablamos con expertos sobre cuáles son las necesidades del edificio.
 Entonces, todas las personas con las que habla tienen una opinión sobre lo que debería suceder con Medford High School, y aprecio los aportes de todos, pero habrá un momento y un lugar para que consultemos con expertos y describamos
 lo que los expertos creen que debe suceder con el edificio y eso no se ha hecho hasta la fecha.
 Entonces, para mí, no me opongo a ninguno de estos gastos per se, pero me opongo a que decidamos que estos gastos son prudentes o un buen uso del dinero de los contribuyentes sin que expertos nos digan que
 de hecho, ese es el caso.
 Así que estoy de acuerdo en que debemos seguir adelante y creo que debemos hacerlo con la mente abierta.
 Recuerdo muy claramente cuando caminábamos por el edificio con el comité de visión o el comité escolar justo antes de la pandemia y escuché a personas que habían estado en el comité.
 mientras hablaban y destrozaban en el pasillo sobre lo que podríamos o no considerar para la escuela secundaria debido al ala de ciencias o por esto y aquello.
 Y me animaría a todos a expresar nuestras opiniones.
 a un lado y realmente elaborar un plan que nos permita comprender cuáles son las necesidades del edificio para que podamos avanzar rápidamente y comenzar a lograr algunos de esos objetivos.
 Y lo último que diré es que, aunque conversamos sobre el plan de capital, no elaboramos un plan de capital.
 Entonces, con esos $800,000, no tengo la impresión de que haya escasez de proyectos, incluidos múltiples techos al final de su vida útil.
 como llegar aquí muy rápidamente y que el plan de capital integral no tuvo en cuenta.
 Así que creo que tenemos mucho trabajo por hacer en nuestro plan capital para que podamos ser buenos socios del resto del gobierno de la ciudad y ayudar a garantizar que se satisfagan las necesidades de nuestro distrito y que no nos encontremos con una situación en la que dejemos de mantener las cosas.
 y nos encontramos en otra situación similar a una pandemia en la que hay muchísimo trabajo por hacer para que los edificios vuelvan a estar a la altura de los estándares.
 Así que soy un firme defensor de que prioricemos ese plan de capital de manera significativa.
 No soy ingeniero estructural.
 No creo que nadie en este comité lo esté.
 Así que me gustaría que prioricemos ese tipo de experiencia cuando hablamos de planes para gastar una cantidad significativa de dinero de los contribuyentes, pero también,
 No creo que tengamos que esperar años y años y años para obtener esa información.
 Creo que los estudiantes que van allí en este momento son muy importantes y, para ser justos con ellos, y realmente, francamente, cada estudiante que está actualmente en las escuelas públicas de Medford, ahora es el momento de avanzar en esta prioridad.
 mis hijos probablemente no se graduarían de una escuela secundaria que luce diferente a la actual.
 Entonces, si tenemos suerte, los niños de primer grado y de jardín de infantes podrían tener la oportunidad de hacer algo diferente, pero sólo si actuamos.
 Así que nos corresponde a nosotros hacerlo.
