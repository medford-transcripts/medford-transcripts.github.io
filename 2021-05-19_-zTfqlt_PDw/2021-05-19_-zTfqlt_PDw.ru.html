    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=208.272s">[David Murphy]</a>:  Thank you, Superintendent, Mayor, members of the school committee.
 It's a pleasure to be with you again this evening.
 for our fifth committee of the whole meeting focused on the FY22 budget.
 As the superintendent mentioned, tonight we'll be focused on elements of the central office, specifically the offices that are under both the superintendent and my own supervision.
 As we go through the beginning of the program, as we have each time, we'll be looking at the org chart and talking specifically about the offices whose budgets are
 are here in light of the fact that these are the offices that myself and the superintendent work most closely with.
 While Dr. Kuching, Ms.
 Galussi, Ms.
 Bowen are here, with the exception of Director McLaughlin, we will be really the only presenters and speakers tonight.
 But certainly we'll be eager to answer any questions that you have, both with respect to the offices that we are focusing on tonight and anything else that we've covered
 over the course of the last several weeks.
 And as I mentioned in my message to the committee, both last night and a few minutes ago, we will be having a budget update on the school committee agenda this coming Monday, May 24th.
 And we'll certainly be picking up questions and comments at that point, incorporating and taking in your feedback.
 And that will go into the development of the recommendations that come before you.
 prior to your June 1st statutory hearing.
 So with that, I will start, as we always do, with the timeline for our budget process, beginning with the development of the district's strategic goals and priorities, leading to a series of, some administrators might say, seemingly endless administrative meetings internally, in which we vet various proposals and comments, questions, and suggestions
 principles and evening, but have not been following along for each of the various budget presentations, both at regular school committee meetings, budget subcommittee and the committee of the whole meetings.
 This is where we are right now leading up to that June 1st public hearing in which members of the community will be invited to speak either for or against, or a favorite for those who follow municipal presentations, those wishing to speak neither for nor against.
 the budget in part or in whole.
 And again, that will take place on June 1st, but there will be a budget update on Monday, an opportunity to comment and engage in further discussion.
 We've used the org chart in each of these presentations, just as by way of showing folks, perhaps outside of the Medford Public Schools community,
 which area of the organization we're focused on in this particular meeting.
 So this is the overall org chart showing all the various offices and departments reporting up to the superintendent.
 And then these are the areas that we'll be discussing tonight.
 So you can see it's primarily the areas in my own portfolio, as well as those reporting directly to the superintendent.
 And you see the curvy arrow there on the right of the screen.
 which is indicating a reorganization of sorts that we'll be proposing as part of the FY22 budget, and that's something I'll be going into greater detail about shortly.
 So as we've discussed in each of the budget presentations, the funding for the Metro Public Schools and the funding generally for school districts across Massachusetts comes from various sources.
 What we often refer to as the Chapter 70 allocation, which is the
 The state contribution under state law coming out of ed reform law of 1993 and the funding that each school community and district are entitled to.
 The local contribution, which is the revenue generated from at the local level that is air marked for the for the school department, which in Medford is a very sizable portion of that of the overall
 operating budget.
 And then the sort of extenuating circumstances under which we're currently operating mean we have a significant influx of federal funding coming in as a result of the COVID-related legislation that has come in.
 And that is coupled with the sort of standing external funds that come in on a year-in and year-out basis, particularly in the area of special education, which we discussed at length at the May 6th Committee of the Whole when we heard from the Office of Pupil Services.
 We've said that throughout the FY22 budget, we've asked those contributing to the development of this budget, meaning our department heads and our principals, to focus essentially on three primary buckets of areas in which we're asking them what are their budgetary priorities, what are their needs, what are their challenges.
 First is personnel and staffing.
 And the committee certainly said before that when we're talking about school budgets, we're almost always talking about people.
 We're an organization made up of people, educating people, hoping to make them better people and people who are positioned to do well in their post-secondary lives.
 But that is always going to be the largest chunk of our budget because, you know, as we say sometimes in school finance, we're not focused on widgets.
 We're focused on people in a community, and that's always going to be the largest chunk.
 Materials and infrastructure, particularly under the challenging conditions under which we're operating, are always going to represent
 another, albeit smaller, aspect of the budget.
 And training and professional development, which everything is, we are looking at everything through a post-COVID context, but for training and professional development, when we think about the ways in which some of the inequities, both within public education and society at large, have come into sharper relief as a result of the experience that we've all lived through, we are thinking very much in that context when we talk about
 what are our professional development and training priorities, and what is it that we're looking to invest in.
 And particularly when we're talking about the superintendent's priorities, while much of what we're planning will be supported by external funding, given that the budget development process is the opportunity to really look at the organization as a whole, see how we're structured, how we're organized, what it is that we're pursuing, what are our discrete challenges, what are our long-term overarching challenges,
 This really is an opportunity to sort of pull the veil back on all of the Medford Public Schools.
 And my hope would be that throughout these committee of the whole presentations, as we've heard from the various directors and school leaders, my hope would be that both for the school committee and the members of the community who are either watching this in real time or perhaps watching it subsequent to the presentations, you'll see the effort toward transparency that we have employed to try to demonstrate for the community exactly what it is that we're doing.
 And I hope also
 the rationale behind these priorities.
 And this slide talks a little bit about that rationale in that these are the questions that were posed that led to the development of these priorities and that we're thinking about what are the targeted and intensive interventions that we can invest in to help reduce or eliminate the learning or opportunity gaps that have either been caused by or exacerbated by the disruption to instruction that our students have faced as a result of
 the COVID-19 pandemic.
 And so there will come a time when our budgetary priorities and our goals are not informed fully by this experience and the disruption that our students have lived through.
 At least I certainly hope that's the case.
 One of the sort of constant refrains that we go back to is we're looking to make investments that will ensure our students' academic careers are not defined by this experience.
 And hopefully if we make these investments and we execute on them wisely, that will be the case.
 But for right now,
 coming out of these, as cliche as it might sound, these unprecedented circumstances, we are looking to see how do we use the funding that's available to us from the local, state, and federal levels to try to put them in the best position possible despite the chaos that we've all lived through.
 So on April 26th, we presented to the school committee the projections that we were looking at based on the preliminary information that we had.
 uh, leading into these budget presentations.
 And we've estimated that, uh, the necessary increase in the budget would be somewhere between 3.4 and $5.8 million.
 Recognizing that there are a significant number of variables that are, uh, essentially not clear while variable one, there are restrictions on federal funding flowing in that are still not particularly clear.
 And I appreciate the mayor's comments to that effect.
 last night, but we're continuing to engage in a very constructive dialogue with our partners in the city government and reaching out to our partners at the state level and elsewhere to try to get clarity on that.
 I think at this point we feel comfortable that the priorities we've developed that we think of as having a strong nexus to the disruption caused by COVID will be essentially eligible expenses.
 It's a question of, from an administrative perspective, exactly how
 we'll go about processing those and exactly how realistic is it to do that.
 So I think we feel good about the priorities that we've identified as our COVID-related or potential ESSER-related priorities, but there's still a lot of clarity that needs to come into view in the coming weeks.
 In addition to that, we know we have fixed costs as every district does on a year-on-year basis.
 These are costs that are related to contractual obligations or
 other situations that have essentially predated the development of this budget, but we know that they're going to lead to an increase in costs.
 Other variables also include the fact that we have upwards of nine collective bargaining agreements that are expiring either at the conclusion of this school year or the conclusion of the summer.
 And so that's certainly a factor that we have to take into account as we work through the development of this budget.
 This is just information related to those external funding, the numbers the committee has seen several times before, so I won't
 belabor it, but we estimate about a $7.6 million ESSER budget over the next several years.
 And so I wouldn't say that we necessarily see that as needing to be expended in equal installments over the three or four year period that we have.
 But I would say that we want to be mindful of the fact that we're going to have additional data that will hopefully point us to more strategic uses of the funding as time goes on.
 So it may be the case that some of the more immediate expenses are in the short term, but the better use of the funding could be in year two or year three.
 And for that reason, we are looking to be, I'm not sure I would use the word conservative, but certainly cautious and cognizant of the implications of using that funding.
 And the fact is, as you've heard me say several times, these are one-time funds and the ESSER funding will not last forever.
 And so we have to be mindful of the uses
 being taking care to not create unnecessary structural deficits, and at the same time, making sure that we're being responsive to the urgent needs of students.
 And so where we strike that equilibrium is a big part of the conversations that we have been having and that we will be having.
 So I'm going to pause for one second before we move on to buildings and grounds and just talk a little bit about what you'll see over the next couple of slides in this, but I'm glad that I flashed to it quickly so that I can tell
 Mr. McLaughlin that he's on next as I continue to babble for another minute or so.
 But the departments that you're seeing starting with buildings, we're going to start with buildings and grounds and then move to the more umbrella offices of the superintendent's office and the office of finance and operations.
 And if you think back to the organizational chart that we saw at the beginning of the presentation, you can see that for both myself and Dr. Edouard-Vincent, there are a lot of priorities and funding and strategic investments
 and proposals that cut across the different departments and offices that you've already heard from.
 And that's a good thing because what we don't want to do is present a budget to you in the form of 25 siloed or overly departmentalized mini organizations.
 We want common themes and common strategic priorities that cut across.
 And so what you'll see in the bullets that we've identified are pieces that are either reflective of those priorities
 or operational pieces that are meant to put us in a position that we'll be able to actually pursue those priorities and do so successfully.
 Similar to the information technology budget proposals that we discussed in last night's committee of the whole, a large portion, arguably all, frankly, of the buildings and grounds priorities, the year maintenance issue,
 uh, that is essentially routine.
 I think routine was the word that we used in the technology presentation.
 That's something that we typically are going to incorporate one way or another into our operating budget.
 Um, something that is a one-time expense and I'm using the term one time in the context of municipal budgeting.
 And so one time could mean every 10 years, every 15 years, every 20 years, but certainly not on an annual basis.
 Um, that's every 20 years, but certainly not on an annual basis.
 That's something that we're going to look up to as a capital expense that we're going to try to keep off the operating budget for purposes of not creating some of those deficits that we've talked about.
 What we do when we have a large influx of federal funding, frankly, similar to how we handled the funding that came in during FY21, and to some extent in FY20 as well, is to try to address some of the most urgent priorities and needs that might in another context be considered a capital expense.
 but in light of the urgency, we're looking to just take what funding is available and make sure that that's addressed.
 That was certainly the case as is reflected in the buildings and grounds budget narrative that was provided to you today with regard to our HVAC repairs that we needed to expedite and accelerate at the beginning of this school year for purposes of getting students and staff back into the physical school buildings.
 And so I expressed my appreciation for Mr. McLaughlin and members of his team who partnered with
 the external experts that we brought in to make that a reality.
 The history as to how we got to the place where so much work was necessary, I think, has been addressed at length in previous meetings.
 But however we got here, we are in a much better position from an air quality perspective because that work was done throughout the course of this year.
 And now we're looking at some of the other heavy infrastructure pieces that may not land in the operating budget for FY22.
 but are critical priorities that need to be addressed in the near term.
 And I'm going to ask Mr. McLaughlin, if he could, to walk us through some of these.
 As we're talking about how these investments need to be made in the coming year or months.
 So John, do you want to take it from there and just start maybe with the generator and transformer electrical issues that we have
 been identified at the high school and at the Andrews and then we'll walk through some of the other pieces.
 From there we'll move on to finance operations in the superintendent's office and then we'll go to questions after that.

 Здравствуйте, губернатор, мэр, член комитета и администратор школы.
 На сегодняшней встрече.
 Итак, первая проблема, которая выходит из строя, связана с электрической программой в средней школе Эндрюса и средней школе Эндрюса.
 Думаю, у нас есть аварийный генератор.
 Аварийный генератор в средней школе Медфорда нуждается в замене.
 Мы это обсуждали.
 Мы находимся в процессе сбора предложений и информации о ценах, чтобы попытаться завершить проект. Есть ли у кого-нибудь голос?</p>

 然后我们将准备好定价信息以继续推进。
 显然，这将是一个带有发电机的夏季项目，只要我们准备好承担该项目即可。
 今年我们进行了一些安全改进。
 我们有一个新的 Raptor 系统。
 当时我安装了所有显示器，并接受了新 Raptor 系统的培训。
 如果你不知道猛禽系统是你进来的地方，你给自己一个许可证，他们会扫描它。
 如果一切顺利，您将收到一个标签，并准备好前往总办公室办理您在我们任何学校需要办理的业务。
 因此，我们希望每三四年完成一次停车场。
 我应该说，通常是整个系统范围内的所有这些。
 停车场又被标记了，它们开始老化了。
 我们想做一些
 梅福德高中的调整，我们将就残疾人停车情况与该学校会面。
 我知道我们在谈论主入口时进行了这样的对话。
 我认为我们想要做的是搬到梅福德高中前面的残疾人专用点，并进入那里的残疾人坡道。
 所以，你知道，让我们回顾一下。
 我和
 Lungo-Koehn 市长上周表示，如果我需要帮助，我们在市政厅有交通部门，他们会非常乐意帮助我们。
 几年前，我们与他们会面，试图做出一些改进，但众所周知，过去的一年并不是我们通常处理的典型年份。
 柯蒂斯塔夫茨锅炉项目，所以去年冬天，锅炉开始泄漏。
 这些都是我们可能会在下周的小组委员会会议上讨论的问题。
 这就是为什么我们订购了一些需要重新安装的部件，即分段部件。
 因此，我们得到了两个部分，他们将更换它们，这应该可以阻止我们预期的泄漏。
 我们将不得不在这方面花费大量资金。
 和暖通空调的改进。
 所以我们知道我们做了很多这样的事情。
 我们目前正在打开空调。
 因此，存在与此相关的问题，某些特定区域需要我们聘请承包商来修复。
 根据法律规定，我们必须在 5 月 15 日之前提供供暖。
 所以这周是我们进行结算的一周。
 不幸的是，本周很热，你知道，这很愚蠢，但这周很热。
 教室里的一些老师感到有点不舒服，但我们正在努力解决。
 我们知道你在那里。
 我们将尽快出去处理所有需要做的事情。
 致电承包商。
 我只是想列出一份我们需要做的事情以及需要做的建筑物的清单。
 嗯，浴室改造项目。
 戴夫和我会见了建筑师。
 嗯，我想我们只是在等待获得许可来查看并制作该项目的 RFP。
 是，我知道这是一个，嗯，
 梅福德高中项目对于改善浴室的许多人来说都是很亲近的。
 我们想要它，我知道。
 市长让我们看看我们能生产多少。
 我想如果我们能得到一个价格，我们就会知道我们在哪里，然后我们就可以从那里走得尽可能远。
 我们仍在等待主入口修复工程。
 看看我们要做什么。
 我们的一个在清洁办公室工作的人是一名瓦工，所以他主动提出出去尝试修复一点墙壁，花岗岩墙。
 所以今天他在那里工作。
 我的意思是，我希望我能让它看起来更好一点，但它仍然会
 什么，是什么，所以你知道我们当然可以在主入口见面，我想我们将在下周和小组委员会讨论并讨论我们希望如何推进这一点。
 这就是为什么我每年都会在预算范围内订购一辆带犁的卡车。
 所以这并没有改变。
 这肯定会对降雪有所帮助，也肯定会对整个地区的其他杂项项目有所帮助。
 如果我们有一辆带犁的卡车。
 所以，你知道，我可以多次帮助 DPW，因为他们行动非常迅速。
 而且，你知道，有时有些区域需要修补，但他们无法返回，因为主要目标是城市周围的道路。
 因此，拥有这样的东西肯定会有助于提高效率。
 由我们处置，接机。
 现在，我想，现在的剧院正在翻修，如果你看到我的预算前报告的话。
 如果我有一个希望看到成果的项目，那就是添加空调、栏杆、更新门以及在剧院进行一些电气工作。
 几年前我得到了一个价格，现在的价格不同了：在剧院的天花板上加装一台空调需要 10 万美元。
 我认为这对社区也有好处。
 也为学校创造收入，也许在某个时候将其添加到我们的资本改进清单中。
 但是，就像我说的，如果我可以选择我想做的高中项目，那将是我的主要项目之一，即改造项目。
 我们一直致力于学校的暖通空调改进项目。
 你知道，在某些时候，也许我们可以从 MSBA 获得帮助，也许我们可以添加空调以及梅福德高中目前没有空调的其他部分，这意味着科学实验室是建筑物中唯一有空调的真正部分。
 服务，你知道，除了我们到处都有的窗式空调。
 所以看不到底部。</p>

 Одна из областей, Совет директоров, Совет директоров, заключается в том, как приостановить управление, основанное на поведении социального обучения, среди других вопросов.
 Так что это действительно главный приоритет.
 Для нас это одно из целевых направлений профессионального развития.
 Кроме того, мы продолжим добиваться дальнейшего понимания и профессионального развития в отношении фактической предвзятости и ее влияния на школьное сообщество.
 Мы также будем и дальше развивать лучшие практические навыки в качестве лидеров, наставников и преподавателей.
 О системе оценки преподавателей, которая способствует подотчетности во всех наших школах.
 Это три больших блока.

 Мы также продолжим уделять внимание вопросам осведомленности об инвалидности и снова постараемся устранить предвзятость.
 Там.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=2280.431s">[David Murphy]</a>: 谢谢你，博士。
 然后去财务和运营办公室。
 正如您所看到的，这里有一些不同点。
 我将重点关注三个方面，包括交通，我认为它有自己的幻灯片，而且确实如此，谢谢。
 但首先，前两个，这是在昨晚的演讲中提到的。
 我认为这是在英语学习部门确定的优先事项的背景下发生的。
 想要投资一个机会来发展我们的努力，主要是我们的家庭承诺和社区关系。
 我当时指出，我们没有确定 22 财年对 EL 部门的具体投资的部分原因是我们从该地区获得了一项投资，我们希望能够推动这一事业，我们将为此努力。
 与 EL 部门、卫生服务部门、特殊教育部门等密切合作。
 我认为，当我们考虑如何构建组织以及如何组织特定的工作组合时，作为一般规则，最佳实践是确定需求，确定正在满足的需求或由于其他变化变量而正在发展的需求，
 然后确定如何最好地开发适合组织结构的角色和组合，以促进这些目标。
 然而，有时会出现多种事件同时发生的情况，我们的领导人员具有可用的能力和不断出现且变得更加紧迫的需求。
 这种融合发生在整个学年。
 老实说，引起我们注意的方式之一是当我们需要将整个行政部门转移到学校担任代课教师时。
 当我们清楚地意识到这令人筋疲力尽且几乎不可能时，我们试图做出不同的修改，我们的课前和课后规划主任继续自愿承担这项工作，并继续与我们沟通，就像她一段时间以来所做的那样，她觉得
 他的投资组合中有空间容纳额外的责任和信心类型，以及我们作为经理和领导者所拥有的个人能力。
 事实上，我们能够度过本学年，但通过能够确定我们可以在父母和家庭参与领域改进和更好地工作的做法，
 我指望黛安·考德威尔（Diane Caldwell）的帮助，她是我们的前副总监，曾担任家长信息中心的高级主任。
 我要说的是，作为一个新来这个学区的人，我在第一周继承了家长信息中心作为我的投资组合的一部分，没有夫人。
 考德威尔，
 如果能够提供这种领导力、指导和机构知识，这将是更具挑战性的一年，不仅是在对 PIC 的监督方面，而且在我和其他高级管理人员负责的工作的几乎所有其他要素方面。
 但我们从一开始就知道，
 考德威尔担任家长信息中心的管理员并不是一个永久的解决方案，他试图在内部运作
 在我们的预算范围内，我们不一定打算为家长信息中心主任作为一个没有其他职责的单一职位提供资金。
 然后是夫人。
 Fidler 表达了承担额外责任的意愿和热情。
 我们认为家长信息中心与贫困学校和缺勤学校计划之间有着紧密的自然联系，以及额外的支持
 呃，我们需要的能力，嗯，我们需要在家庭关系、交通方面的能力。
 嗯，我们认为这适合作为一个合法的、全面的管理组合。
 因此，作为 22 财年预算的一部分，我们建议将这些办公室重组为一般家庭参与区域，其中包括对家长信息中心的监督、对课前和课后计划的持续监督。
 以及交通连接等服务。
 现在，坦率地说，所有这些角色组合在一起的原因之一是它们是学年的不同部分，需要更大程度的关注和细节。
 这就是为什么我说这是一种融合，因为它非常适合与已经具备机构知识的人一起创建一个完整的 12 个月的角色。
 并在过去为该地区做出了出色的工作。
 这就是为什么能够有效地做到这一点，同时也对如何更有效地推进学区围绕家庭和社区伙伴关系的目标充满信心，是制定该提案的一部分。
 所以这是一场戏。
 然后你会看到，正如昨晚也提到的，
 我们设立了赠款协调员职位。
 这本身是一个非预算的事情，它不一定会对运营预算和赠款产生影响，这个人基本上一直担任非官方赠款协调员一段时间，但从技术上讲，在行政助理的角色中，我们已经能够将该人调到财务和运营办公室，与米歇尔·金登和她的团队合作，以确保我们
 履行我们的所有义务并尽可能有效地从合规角度执行。
 这是不同的，我想强调这一点。
 这当然与我们目前没有的拨款写作角色不同，但我们正在探索其他方法来释放一些能力，让管理员有机会更好地培养外部合作伙伴关系和
 并寻找赠款机会，以便我们的赠款协调员能够帮助协调并尝试以这种方式释放额外的预算能力。
 在我们谈论交通之前，我想再说一遍，这是我们昨晚谈话的延续。
 在本学年中，我们继续与 Management Solution 和 Paquette 先生保持合作关系，Paquette 先生担任临时代理
 夫人之间的业务管理员
 帕特森和我。
 我们已准备好委托提交给学校委员会的报告。
 基本上，我要求对报告进行附录，因为该报告是在整个学年中准备的，并在某种程度上促进了预算制定过程。
 我问帕克特先生，根据我们仍然拥有的预付款，
 基本上，您可以填写一些补充内容，其中会考虑到我们所做的一些更改，夫人。
 Kimu 和我在过去的几个月里将这一点付诸实践。
 这就是为什么我预计在本财年结束之前将其提交给委员会。
 然后，帕克特先生，我们与塔夫茨大学的合作伙伴关系，一开始只是测试合作伙伴关系，后来发展为对话。
 在技​​术基础设施的背景下，我希望我们整个夏天都能非常有效地从中受益。
 但随后我们还将探讨在展望 2022 财年时我们应该保留或可能参考的其他外部知识。
 这是一个高层次的概述。
 我将结束交通，然后继续回答您的问题。
 如果您还记得当我们谈论 22 财年的预测时，我们的成本增加了约 51,000。
 我必须快速地说，这些是因为它们是在 5 月 6 日解决的。
 这些与我们与特殊教育相关的固定交通成本无关。
 这是我们的主要供应商东方巴士。
 学校委员会于 2020 年春季签订了一份为期三年的新合同。
 所以，我们正在完成其中的第一个。
 的三年合同。
 与合同一样，成本逐年增加。
 因此，我们预计该合同将增加约 51,000 美元，作为我们预计固定成本增加 210 万美元的一部分。
 4 月 26 日，当提出有关 MBTA 通行证的请求时，您已经看到了以下两个数字。
 这本质上是我们的一个选择
 确保委员会知道。
 然后还有一些问题，涉及额外黄色巴士的基本成本以及在高中提供额外东区巴士容量的可能性。
 我们估计约为 75,000 美元。
 我之所以说它是零到 75,000 美元，是因为在我们与供应商的对话中，他们有，
 我认为，并且我很欣赏这一点，我不知道是否所有提供商都会这样做，但他们建议，根据本学年之前该学区采用的半径，就初中和高中交通而言，有可能重新调整我们现有的一些能力，以提供至少一辆额外的巴士到高中。
 下周我们将与
 巴士提供商以及梅德福警察局，我们将在那里讨论一系列问题，既与安全有关，也与规划即将到来的夏季学年的路线和站点的开发有关。
 所以，坦率地说，我目前没有向委员会提出关于是否应该增加第二辆公共汽车的任何建议。
 我认为很明显我们可以做到这一点。
 所以我认为问题在于查看有关哪里的数据
 什么是高中生以及是否有需求。
 我要说的是，在我与中等教育管理部门的简短对话中，我们根本不清楚是否知道对此有明确的需求，但我认为我们要牢记这一点。
 但与此同时，如果为学生提供更方便的服务的成本在 0 到 75,000 美元之间，那么显然我们会考虑这一点。
 我认为从战略角度来看，我们需要牢记 MBTA 通行证显然有可能提供更多的准入机会。
 而且，你知道，你开始考虑学生工作、去城市的机会。
 城市还有其他类型的体验，例如 MBTA 通行证可以为学生提供的课堂和体验式学习体验。
 我们正在考虑所有这些选择。
 贯穿所有演示的一个共同点是，我们决心在 21-22 学年为学生建立有效的延长上课日和课外活动计划，利用 ESSER 资金确保我们在学生面临重大干扰后提供尽可能最大的恢复支持。
 因此，我感谢您抽出时间并在这方面给予我宽容。
 如果你喜欢我可以提供更多证词和证人的演示，我保证我也更喜欢它们。
 但这些是建筑物和土地、财务和运营办公室以及主管办公室的记录。
 此时，我将很乐意回答您的问题。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3062.978s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Спасибо, джентльмен.
 У нас есть фургоны для близких членов, а затем и для членов Руссо.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3068.903s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Спасибо
 В конце концов я пойду перевезти школьный автобус.
 Дэйв, вы предложили нам несколько интересных вариантов, но с огромной разницей в цене.
 На данный момент, когда вы создаете этот бюджет,
 Кто вы и познакомите нас?
 Да ладно, я имею в виду, как нам начать?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3100.169s">[David Murphy]</a>: Ну, я думаю, что первое первоначальное решение заключалось в том, предпочитает ли комитет радиус, утвержденный в прошлом году, радиусу в одну милю для всех классов, кроме детского сада.
 Так что, если это то, что комитет хочет сохранить
 Значит продавец обязательно говорит, что в начальной школе их будет слишком много.
 Таким образом, текущий автобусный контракт на автобусы стоимостью около 1,4 миллиона долларов даст нам дополнительный школьный автобус, который, я думаю, нам следует рассмотреть возможность использования в старших классах для увеличения вместимости.
 Мой единственный вопрос
 В противном случае мы можем переключиться на внеклассную программу и продлить учебный день, не неся дополнительных потенциальных затрат в размере 100 000 долларов.
 Или, по крайней мере, стоит заплатить.
 Поэтому я думаю, что первое решение заключается в том, доволен ли совет радиусом в милю, который, по словам поставщиков услуг, не имеет большого значения.
 Вот где мы находимся.
 Если это так
 Поэтому я думаю, что следующим шагом будет изучение данных о том, где живут старшеклассники, и существует ли значимый способ узнать, где находятся ученики.
 Опять же, я думаю, что единственным недостатком этой программы является то, что с одобрения MBTA вас не просто возят в школу.
 Я думаю, что особенно для наших старшеклассников есть много возможностей пробного обучения, которые MBTA Transit может им предложить.
 Последнее, что я хочу сказать, это то, что если мы привяжем программу к ее приобретению, токен MBTA станет лучшей инвестицией.
 Я думаю, что это может занять некоторое время, возможно, лета будет достаточно, чтобы наши наставники успели разработать такого рода возможности, чтобы повлиять на потенциальный эффект от этих инвестиций.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3230.138s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Итак, Дэйв, давайте вернемся к тому, что вы сказали о пробеге.
 Должен сказать, что я не пропустил выборы.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3239.024s">[David Murphy]</a>: Итак... это опережает мое время, но я понимаю, что когда этот тщательно продуманный план выносится на рассмотрение школьного комитета, который является многофункциональным планом, радиовещание является его частью.
 В результате были улучшены дороги и остановки.
 Я так думал и знал, что знаю это.
 Это потому, что в этом году гонщики так сильно упали, что обычно вы съезжаете с автобусной остановки и слышите основной ответ, но в этом году этого не произошло.
 Также возможно, что количество пассажиров значительно сократилось из-за распространения эпидемии.
 Если это не будет реализовано в следующем году, возможно, вам стоит подумать об этом.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3280.253s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Да, я думаю, вполне понятно, что количество наших пассажиров значительно сократилось.
 Я знаю, что в Медфорде есть студенты, которые садятся на автобус из-за опасений по поводу дорожного движения и безопасности дорожного движения, в котором они живут.

 Ваша автобусная остановка станет частью нашего разговора на следующей неделе.

 Потому что, изучая и анализируя дороги и места, мы хотим быть уверены, что любое вызывающее беспокойство место тщательно проверено экспертами по общественной безопасности и

 Дэйв кажется мне оптимистом, и я в целом настроен оптимистично, но я не готов торговать двумя.
 Да, выше 350, и это большое изменение.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3661.661s">[David Murphy]</a>: Нет, это хороший вопрос.
 Я думаю, ты прав.
 Я имею в виду, иногда есть различия.
 Я думаю, что большинство
 Эта разница возникает между регионами из-за системы мира, которая существует вокруг легкой атлетики.
 Я думаю, именно поэтому вы так часто видите эту разницу, но они играют аналогичную роль с той частью нашей образовательной программы, которая привлекает студентов и приводит их сюда, откровенно говоря, наслаждаясь и получая максимальную отдачу от своего образования.
 Поэтому я рад изучить это и посмотреть, существует ли оно.
 Есть ли какие-либо дефекты, при устранении которых нам может понадобиться помощь в ремонте?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3704.757s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: Спасибо
 Поэтому я решил задать еще один вопрос, который я видел в проекте, связанном с ванной комнатой.
 Опять же, это мой четвертый год и четвертый год, когда студенты пытаются найти способы обеспечить наших студентов продуктами менструального цикла.
 Какой позор.
 Я не знаю, все ли на этой встрече с этим согласны, но это очень сложно.
 Проект CCSR работает уже четыре года подряд, чтобы сезонные студенты не испытывали трудностей с доступом к этим продуктам.
 Это было очень интересно.
 Я просто хочу прояснить, что я ни за кого не голосую.
 Ремонт ванной комнаты Если в каждой ванной комнате проводится ремонт, то нет бесплатного сезонного распределительного автомата.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3762.382s">[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>: Доктор Эдвард Винсент?
 Господин Руссо, я просто хочу прокомментировать, что, раз вы написали эти строки, вы полагаете, что, когда ученики в старшей школе пользуются туалетом и им не разрешается пользоваться женскими товарами, у нас есть целый медицинский кабинет.
 В ванной комнате используются женские изделия, но, к сожалению, иногда женские изделия используются не по назначению.
 Их использовали для украшения ванных комнат и со временем установили на потолке.
 Это случалось много раз.
 Это контролируемая и контролируемая ванная комната.
 Итак, мы пригласили вас, студентов CCSR, и я сделал это проект, но я хочу, чтобы все знали, что женские товары доступны в медицинском кабинете и им не отказано в доступе.
 У нас есть много продуктов в медицинской сфере, и я не против предоставления машин, которыми смогут пользоваться студенты, но я просто хочу отметить, что когда мы их даем, они используют их не для тех целей, для которых хотят.
 Это одна из причин, по которой они исключены из прошлого.
 Поэтому я просто хочу сказать, что мы не пытаемся разговаривать со студентами или говорить им, что такого не существует.
 Я хочу, чтобы все знали, что оно доступно, и особенно в первичных и вторичных медицинских учреждениях есть достаточные запасы.
 Эта услуга доступна для всех встреч.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3866.52s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: Спасибо
 Мэр, было бы здорово, если бы вы ответили быстро.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3869.988s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Итак, есть участники Kreatz.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3872.29s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: Да, я понял.
 Я бы никогда никому не советовал пытаться отрицать эти вещи.
 Я просто предлагаю взять карту школы и представить ученика в самой дальней точке больницы.
 Я имею в виду, что из всех членов учебного комитета я здесь единственный.
 У него не было такого опыта.
 Я просто делаю предположения насчет всех вас, но, знаете, даже я не могу себе представить, что они находятся так далеко от медицинского центра в этом большом здании, а вы говорите, что знаете, где он.
 Я прошел через здание, чтобы посмотреть, как оно выглядит.
 Я сказал, во-первых, это не двухминутная прогулка.
 То есть, мы говорим, я не знаю когда, но я думаю,
 То, что мы считаем барьером доступа, кажется очень высоким или очень высоким, действительно, любое сходство.
 Я знаю, что есть и другие области, которые сделали это, а я этого не сделал, они не являются большой проблемой на первой полосе мира.
 Я знаю, что то, что я читаю о здоровье, не является здоровым молодежным занятием, я забыл, что в прошлом году требовал закон в школе.
 Но бывают начальные ситуации, когда, когда вы их устанавливаете и даете бесплатно, они застревают на потолке, и нуждающиеся в них дети могут забрать домой полную корзину.
 Но, как и многие вещи, они могут быть скучными.
 Тогда, когда они понадобятся студентам, они будут рядом.
 Поэтому я не хочу, чтобы это был простой проект.
 Я просто твердо верю
 CCSR, я думаю, что это проект CCSR, он появился в моем почтовом ящике на Facebook неделю назад, я думаю, речь идет о студентах, которые этим занимаются.
 Они этого не делают, потому что им больше нечего делать.
 Поэтому я думаю, что мы не слушаем наших студентов.
 Я рассматриваю сайт CCSR 2016 как один из проектов этого года.
 Я не знаю, когда мы сможем это сделать, но спасибо.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4012.217s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Спасибо, конгрессмен Крест, конгрессмен Грэм, конгрессмен Маклафлин.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4015.74s">[Kathy Kreatz]</a>: Ну, я просто хочу поблагодарить тебя.
 Сначала у меня были вопросы только о доставке, но сначала я хочу, чтобы вы знали, что это была отличная презентация, МакЛафлин, вы проделали отличную работу и у вас была программа.
 Этот вопрос будет в повестке дня на следующей неделе, и мы обсудим его на заседании подкомитета на следующей неделе.
 Итак, у меня еще один вопрос по поводу доставки.
 Что-то случилось, потому что я включил эту информацию, потому что не помню в зеркале.
 Итак, я прочитал советник по транспорту к Олимпийским играм 2021 года, и там говорится, что все государственные школы не будут забирать или вывозить учеников из желтой школы, даже если их физический адрес находится в пределах двух полных школьных миль.
 Мы знаем, что это изменение является значительным бременем, и всегда предоставляем услугу доставки сверх указанной суммы.
 Поэтому я не уверен, что у меня правильная информация.
 Господин Мерфи, у меня нет информации о ситуации, о которой вы упомянули.
 Я не помню ни одной встречи по этому поводу.
 Так что я просто хочу поговорить об этом.
 Я знаю тебя
 Об этом говорил Ван дер Дир.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4092.141s">[David Murphy]</a>: Сэр, я просто хочу уточнить.
 Я говорю это, отрицая, что это произошло до моего приезда сюда, но с тех пор я в этом участвую.
 Если кто-то из моих коллег захочет поделиться своими воспоминаниями, пожалуйста, не делайте этого.
 Но, как я объяснил при создании комитета, радиус составлял 2,0 мили.
 Я знаю, что это для средней школы.
 Опять же, этому есть предел, как я стал, думаю, в школе меня учили где-то полторы версты, но это не касалось.
 Кроме того, чтобы уменьшить жесткость всего автобуса, поставщикам услуг следует рекомендовать принять радиус в одну милю на первичном уровне и радиус в две мили на вторичном уровне.
 Эй, прочти это.
 Честно говоря, количество пассажиров автобусов сократилось настолько, что неясно, нужно ли поставщикам услуг применять радиус в милю.
 Кстати, надо сказать, к детскому саду это не относится.
 Поэтому отказ – это отказ от безопасности района, детского сада и учащихся с ограниченными возможностями и транспорта в индивидуальном плане обучения, что, конечно, тоже не предполагает этого разговора.
 Но радиус в одну милю и винтовка в две мили основаны на ограничениях Covid, а другой —
 Честно говоря, именно вынужденное несоблюдение ограничений – не редкость в обществе, особенно когда в автобусе есть места.
 Это то, чем мы занимаемся этим летом, запланированный маршрут и остановки у поставщиков на этой машине.
 Поставщик предупредил, что если мы это сделаем, то, скорее всего, по контракту нам будет поставлено 18 автобусов.
 После прошлогоднего одобрения нам нужен парк всего из 17 автобусов, из которых высвободятся 18 автобусов для обеспечения второго школьного автобуса.
 Я подумал: доктор Кушинг, я вижу, вы поднимаете руку.
 Если я допущу ошибку, пожалуйста, поправьте меня.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4219.238s">[Peter Cushing]</a>: Вы говорите, что нет ничего плохого.
 Вы были правы.
 Я думаю, можно сказать, что одним из положительных аспектов эпидемии является то, что она действительно укрепила отношения между режиссерами.
 Я приношу извинения городским властям и родителям за то, что на самом деле взял на себя обязательство обеспечить безопасную дорогу в школу, наши выбросы ископаемого топлива через автобусные остановки и создание пешеходного школьного автобуса, чтобы предоставить учащимся безопасный способ добраться в школу и из школы.
 И давайте посмотрим на другие способы убедиться, что мы даем детям возможность безопасно ходить в школу, но это также проблема, вызванная эпидемией, о которой каждый из нас думал, когда вел этот разговор в прошлом году.
 Они встречают людей и направляются в школу.
 Мы получаем данные карты ГИС со всех мест проживания учащихся.
 Поскольку эпидемия замедлилась, мы провели тщательный анализ, чтобы изучить все это, а затем рассмотрели вероятность того, что эпидемия может изменить привычки и отношения.</p>

 ខ្ញុំបាន heard មនុស្សជាច្រើននិយាយថាក្មេងៗជិះម៉ូតូ MBTA មានន័យថាយឺតហើយដែលមិនអាចជឿទុកចិត្តបានហើយឪពុកម្តាយកំពុងស្វែងរកវិធីផ្សេងទៀតដើម្បីឱ្យកូន ៗ របស់ពួកគេទៅសាលារៀនព្រោះពួកគេមិនទុកចិត្តឡានក្រុង MBTA ។
 សូមពិចារណាថាមានសិស្សដទៃទៀតដែលពឹងផ្អែកយ៉ាងខ្លាំងទៅលើឡានក្រុង MBTA ទាំងនោះឆ្លងកាត់ឆ្លងកាត់
 ដោយផ្ទាល់ខ្ញុំមិនបានដឹងអំពីវិធីផ្សេងៗគ្នាដើម្បីទៅធ្វើការហើយជិះឡានក្រុងប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំមិនចង់ព្រងើយកន្តើយទេដែលមានសមាជិកសហគមន៍ដែលស្ថិតក្នុងស្ថានភាពនេះ។
 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំសង្ឃឹមថាយើងនឹងដោះស្រាយបញ្ហាចរាចរណ៍ម្តងទៀតហើយសង្ឃឹមថាអ្នករាល់គ្នានឹងសហការជាមួយក្រុមហ៊ុនឡានក្រុងភាគខាងកើតគឺនាយកដ្ឋានប៉ូលីសនិងទីភ្នាក់ងារផ្សេងទៀត។
 យើងសង្ឃឹមថាសហគមន៍អាចរកវិធីល្អបំផុតទៅមុខ។
 វេជ្ជបណ្ឌិត Cushing ខ្ញុំក៏ប្រាប់អ្នកផងដែរខ្ញុំចាំបានថាការសន្ទនាអំពីកាំមួយឬពីរម៉ាយល៍និងវត្ថុដូចនោះដែរអំពីការមិនមានកាំនៅកម្រិតបឋម។
 នៅពេលដែលលោក Murphy បាននិយាយអំពីមត្តេយ្យធ្វើជាករណីលើកលែងខ្ញុំគិតថាខ្ញុំចាប់ផ្តើមគិតថាប្រសិនបើបានអនុវត្ត
 មួយពាន់ធៀបនឹងពីរពាន់ឬអ្វីមួយដូចនោះ។
 ទោះយ៉ាងណាអ្នកនៅតែត្រូវយកកូនរបស់អ្នកនៅកន្លែងណាមួយដែលអ្នកមិនធ្លាប់មានពីមុនមក។
 តើអ្នកអនុវត្តយ៉ាងម៉េចហើយជានិស្សិតដែលមានលក្ខណៈជាសិស្សថ្នាក់មត្តេយ្យក្នុងរយៈពេល 4 កាំ?
 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំគិតថាមានការពិភាក្សាជាច្រើនអំពីការដឹកជញ្ជូនដែលចាំបាច់ត្រូវដោះស្រាយ។
 ប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំសង្ឃឹមថាថវិកាឆ្លុះបញ្ចាំងយ៉ាងច្បាស់ថានិស្សិតនឹងមិនមានការលំបាកក្នុងការចូលរៀននៅឆ្នាំក្រោយទេ។
 តើអ្នកចង់ទូរស័ព្ទឬខ្ញុំគួរសួរសំណួរផ្សេងទៀតទេ?</p>

 ខ្ញុំយល់ថាចលនានេះមានន័យថាយើងមិនចង់អោយសិស្សណាម្នាក់ឱ្យពឹងផ្អែកលើការចំណាយ MBTA បានទិញដោយការចំណាយផ្ទាល់ខ្លួនរបស់ពួកគេដើម្បីទៅសាលារៀន។

 ហើយបញ្ហាមួយទៀតដែលខ្ញុំគិតថាយើងត្រូវដោះស្រាយគឺថានឹងមាននិស្សិតដែលចង់បានការបញ្ចុះតម្លៃ MBTA ឆ្លងកាត់។

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4879.947s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Итак, как вы хотите, чтобы решение было представлено?
 Вице-президент Грэм и Мерфи сообщили нам, что мы увидим 1 июня, а не 1 августа.
 Я думаю, это ясно.
 Итак, вы упомянули 1 августа, я просто хочу знать, что я поддерживаю, что доступно и когда.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4905.178s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Таким образом, в бюджет будет включено предположение, что исследование ничего не стоит.
 До сих пор пересмотр транспортных планов и стратегий невозможен.
 Это период, который длится до 1 августа.
 Если говорить конкретно, MBTA бесплатна для всех или существует стратегия «желтых автобусов», и именно ее мы меняем?
 В радиусе одной-двух миль все это явно влияет на бюджет, а также на то, что происходило в школьном округе после утверждения бюджета.
 Но бюджет должен отражать возможность, которая позволит нам ходить в школу, не требуя от учеников платы.
 Понял, Мерфи?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4960.204s">[David Murphy]</a>: Ну, я думаю, единственное возражение, и я действительно не пытаюсь обратить на это внимание, это то, что я не думаю, что мы сейчас просим кого-то платить за школу.
 Фактически, некоторые ученики ездят на автобусе MBTA, а в желтом автобусе нашей школы нет места, поэтому им приходится выбирать в зависимости от того, где они живут, место проживания семьи или другие обстоятельства.
 Поэтому, конечно, они платят за посещение школы, но политика округа не гласит, что мы не позволяем вам ездить на автобусе MBTA, пока вы платите за автобус MBTA, который вы платите.
 Поэтому я думаю, что мы хотим собрать данные о текущем количестве студентов и, надеюсь, какое-то время посмотрим на них и посмотрим, превысит ли MBTA сумму, которую мы продаем, и примет ли пределы того, что у нас есть.
 Так что, я думаю, мы посмотрим, сможем ли мы снизить затраты с точки зрения увеличения вместимости желтого автобуса.
 Поэтому я думаю, что когда мы продаем MBTA, пройдите через это, потому что, как мы уже говорили ранее, мы не хотим поощрять наших студентов пользоваться скидкой.
 Поэтому я думаю, что нам нужно собрать данные о карте.
 Карты используются на основе предпочтений или приобретаются больше на основе предпочтений или отсутствия предпочтений?
 Еще один способ пойти в школу.
 Поэтому я думаю, что цель ясна.
 Как я уже сказал, у нас все будет хорошо, и мы вернемся, когда столкнемся с государственным учреждением или когда стартап покажется невозможным.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5066.605s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Члены совета МакЛафлина относятся к этому движению.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5068.707s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: За это движение спасибо.
 Просто чтобы внести ясность,
 С одной точки зрения, я думаю, я просто пытаюсь подтвердить, что такая вещь существует, но долгожданная проблема заключается в том, что у нас есть студенты, платящие за обучение, большинство из которых находятся в неблагоприятном экономическом положении.
 Может быть, в радиусе мили или, по крайней мере, в радиусе мили.
 Если вы думаете об ограничении пробега в районе МакГлинн возле средней школы МакГилни, ходите в школу пешком, потому что они не могут позволить себе покупать ее за 30 долларов в месяц со скидкой, которая может оказать огромное влияние на их семью.
 Я думаю, это справедливо
 Мораль — это утверждение, а наш бюджет отражает наши ценности, и я думаю, что удивлен, увидев, что исторически даже школьный совет сидел по другую сторону трибуны, и ученики должны были за это платить.
 Школьный транспорт, особенно потому, что это ученик, который не может, и если подумать о количестве прогулов, вы знаете, это имеет большое влияние, поэтому я знаю MBTA, но я позволю Финансовому комитету сделать это и дам нам это сделать.
 Знаете, когда мы это оценим, мы сможем больше узнать об анализе затрат и выгод на следующей или последней встрече.
 Но я хочу оставить это в стороне и поддерживаю шаг мистера Грэма.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5169.127s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Обзор 1 июня.

 Предложение было одобрено.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5205.937s">[David Murphy]</a>: Извините, я не могу этого понять.
 Мне следовало задать этот вопрос, прежде чем он продолжил, но я просто хотел задать более ясный вопрос.
 Да, есть предложение создать для средней школы радиус 3 км, потому что согласно действующей политике, даже если желтую табличку снимут, эти ученики не получат желтую табличку.
 Но я не знаю, я не знаю, что дает карта MBTA, но если ученик живет в четырехмильной школе, мы все равно позаботимся о том, чтобы у ученика был бесплатный транспорт.
 Существуют ли аналогичные правила при рассмотрении вопроса о том, как дойти до школы?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5248.902s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Нет, я имею в виду, что если закон требует от учеников ходить в школу пешком, то я согласен и продолжаю это делать.
 Теперь я не прошу вас откусить это яблоко самостоятельно.
 Меня беспокоят люди, которые живут на расстоянии более трех миль [3 км] от школы и вынуждены платить за обучение.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5273.365s">[David Murphy]</a>: Если вы живете более чем в 2 милях от школы и за ее пределами, вы знаете, кто-то начал получать бесплатный желтый автобус, а кому-то сказали, что он должен платить 30 долларов в месяц за транзит MBTA.
 Это отвратительно.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5289.571s">[David Murphy]</a>: Если это проблема, которую мы пытаемся решить, я думаю, это разумный способ сделать это.
 Это то, что мы можем наблюдать.
 В законе четко указано, что никому старше шести лет не разрешается водить машину.
 Вот почему существует закон, обеспечивающий соблюдение существующих правил в пределах 2 миль, которые едины по всей стране.
 Это имеет смысл, и мы можем это сделать.
 Однако ваш ответ говорит мне, что мы все согласны с тем, что такое неравенство, и что это то, чем мы хотим заняться.
 Для достижения этой цели мы разработаем план голосования.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5326.754s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: Я могу прокомментировать эту информацию, потому что не уверен, четко ли мы ее обсуждаем или нет, по крайней мере, я это чувствую и хочу уточнить.
 Сколько реальных случаев?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5336.458s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Депутат Маклафлин Идея ясна.</p>

 Я думаю, моя особая проблема в том, что студентам, испытывающим финансовые трудности, приходится платить
 Транспорт в школу.
 Так что, находится ли это в пределах двух миль, двух миль, одной мили или того, что мы предлагаем.
 Я знаю, что в прошлом учителя платили за то, чтобы их ученики поступили в MBTA.
 Паспорт.
 Таким образом, Мерфи, по вашему мнению, может нуждаться в большем рассмотрении, не обязательно основанном на конкретных движениях, или добавление этого движения позволит MBTA проходить через классы в городе, им может быть разрешено иметь возможности трудоустройства.
 Транспорт до школы может быть разрешен.
 Некоторые из наиболее важных частей, которые меня интересуют: вы задаете вопросы?
 Это верно.
 В этом смысле фокусируемся ли мы на экономических трудностях?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5405.854s">[David Murphy]</a>: Ох, я думаю, эта петиция... Я думаю, она для всех.
 Да, я думаю, что это так.
 Да, это шире, чем просто экономические трудности, но оно не охватывает студентов в радиусе двух миль.
 Это дает нам точку данных, аналогичную той, о которой говорит доктор Гришэм, используя GPS для определения нашей перспективы графических данных, и нам нужно убедиться, что они ходят в школу бесплатно.
 Как и перед Днем труда, просто разместив автобус в главном зале, мы смогли разместить как можно больше студентов.
 Если бы мы могли, я думаю, это было бы самое простое руководство для подражания.
 Если мы посмотрим на это и скажем «хорошо», автобусы, которыми мы пользуемся перед каникулами, обслуживают только 15% наших студентов.
 Для обслуживания различных районов города нам нужно 6 новых автобусов.
 Так что, возможно, мы вернемся назад и скажем, что нам нужно восстанавливать по-другому, потому что сейчас у нас нет устойчивого способа сделать это.
 Так что теперь нам, возможно, придется сократить расходы, и мы нацеливаем их на тех, кто испытывает экономические трудности, как сказал Иккрофлин.
 Опять же, я не знаю точно, каким будет результат, но думаю, что у нас есть четкое направление, и мы рады двигаться вперед.</p>

 Тогда мой последний комментарий был просто о том, что я не терплю трату денег.
 Финансирование ванной комнаты Кэролайн Лун или проекта реставрации будет продолжаться до тех пор, пока не будет разработан генеральный план, который действительно отвечает долгосрочным потребностям средней школы.
 Это много денег.
 Общая сумма составляет около четверти миллиона долларов, что немало, если мы говорим
 Как и 10 энергетиков, многих учителей мы не можем попасть в бюджет.
 Помимо затрат без четкого плана строительства, есть много других приоритетов.
 Я уже говорил об этом раньше, но важно иметь четкий план здания.
 До сих пор мне не удавалось поддержать финансирование сообщества в том виде, в котором оно идет с нами или идет вместе с нами, для удовлетворения потребностей строительства больших зданий, которые еще не прошли оценку.

 Так что я думаю, что их много.
 Старшая школа требует от комитета большого внимания и видения, а работа, которую мы делаем, займет годы.
 Поэтому я хочу сказать, что я не согласен.
 Я хочу это подтвердить.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5796.765s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: Спасибо
 У меня есть несколько вопросов.
 Думаю, начну с этой темы, так как она последняя.
 Я думаю, что хочу, чтобы в следующую повестку дня был включен Комитет по видению MHS, чтобы мы знали их мнение, когда думаем о трате денег.
 Я не хочу тратить хорошие деньги после одного плохого.
 Было много дискуссий по поводу средней школы, но у нас до сих пор нет комитета по видению.
 Надеюсь, что этот вопрос будет включен в следующую повестку дня.
 Итак, возвращаясь к теме поставок, председатель предлагает Мерфи связать возможности программы со своим приобретением?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5840.763s">[David Murphy]</a>: Один из этих файлов?

 Вы говорите о доставке, и мне жаль, что я не забрал вас.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5854.951s">[David Murphy]</a>: Извините, я думаю, речь идет о прохождении MBTA.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5858.012s">[David Murphy]</a>: Я сказал: я думаю, что ты того же мнения, что и мама.
 Маккролин говорит, что пропуск MBTA — отличная инвестиция для учащихся школы.
 Если покупка MBTA Pass связана с этим, то это отличная инвестиция.
 Программы и репетиторство. Возможности для вовлечения студентов в жизнь сообщества и предоставления возможностей практического обучения.
 Я пока не знаю, есть много учителей, у которых есть CCR, CCSR - первый пример, но есть много возможностей преподавания на уровне средней школы, получения образования в обществе и в мире образования в целом за пределами общего класса.
 И если мы хотим увеличить инвестиции
 И инвестирование в MBTA Pass, так что, на мой взгляд, если мы сделаем это и подумаем о нашем преподавании, я думаю, что само по себе это, по крайней мере, хорошо, но у него также есть такой ресурс, чтобы они могли получить доступ к студентам.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5931.149s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: Спасибо
 Я думаю, это то, что вы хотите сказать и что вы хотите подчеркнуть, потому что я думаю, что на эту работу привлекаются профессиональные студенты, волонтеры CCSR и все такое.
 Поэтому интересно посмотреть, каковы возможности программы, когда мы думаем об анализе затрат различных вариантов.
 Я знаю, что у нас есть не только специализированные автобусы, но и транспортные компании.
 У нас много поставщиков услуг доставки, и между ними есть некоторые проблемы.
 Лично у нас есть некоторые проблемы с нашими поставщиками услуг доставки, и я знаю, что сложно удержать или удержать сотрудников.
 Особенно в нынешней ситуации.
 Но мне интересно, есть ли средний шанс или почти как решение клика C-Clash?
 То, что предлагают продавцы, непоследовательно даже в некоторых сделках, которые я видел.
 Нормально ли, что твои родители приходят домой с письмом, в котором говорится, что если ты опоздаешь на автобус утром, они не заберут тебя днем?
 Вы не можете.
 Но это средство передвижения для специального образования.
 Но это именно та карта, которую мы видим.
 Вот о чем я говорю.
 Должна быть последовательность в контракте, бюджете и качестве претензий.
 Почему верно?
 Одна администрация выслушивает жалобы на один отдел, а другой менеджер выслушивает жалобы на другой отдел, поэтому главная проблема заключается в том, понимает ли школьный комитет, что является разумным.</p>

 Мэр, позвольте мне прояснить: декан студенческой службы полон энтузиазма, но я также силен.
 Я думаю о людях, которые этого не сделали, о том, как они с этим справились и как они показали, что транспорт работает.
 Честно говоря, я думаю, что это связано со сбором данных.
 Есть также такие вещи, как дети, которые поздно идут в школу.
 Но опять же, я считаю, что необходимо сосредоточиться на наших поставщиках.
 Наконец, я хотел бы поблагодарить руководителя за ее лидерство в достижении целей профессионального развития и развития карьеры в области практической предвзятости и социальных исследований.
 Я услышал от сотрудников и членов сообщества два заголовка о профессиональном развитии, которые мне хотелось бы подчеркнуть.
 Один из них
 Я думаю, что некоторые профессиональные сотрудники не обязательно ощущают развитие определенных навыков, ну, знаете, особых лицензий или требований, поэтому я хочу остановиться на этом.
 Знаете, просто забота об обеспечении вашего участия и профессионального развития, что так важно для обучения, на самом деле является частью обучения, но я думаю, что многие люди потеряли учителей.
 Это профессора с хорошими связями. Насколько я знаю, вы знаете.
 Но я думаю, что также здорово иметь возможность дать людям возможность выбора гибкости и карьерного роста.
 Так что это не то, на что я жду ответов сегодня вечером, но я просто хочу поговорить о них, чтобы вы знали.

 Как мы проведем это время, я думаю, нам понадобится некоторое время, чтобы разобраться, но я не должен об этом говорить, но я бы сказал, что это должен быть план, согласно которому мы увеличим вместимость желтого автобуса.
 У нас есть X пропусков MBTA, и школьный округ берет на себя расходы тех, кто прошел и является судоходным.
 Другие ассоциации помогают оплатить полную стоимость и смотрят, какие данные мы можем собрать, чтобы определить основу для покупок студентов MBTA.
 Так что я думаю, что да, нам нужно посмотреть на каждую шкалу.
 Думаю, что бы я понял, если бы мы знали до 1 августа

 Маклафлин, тогда мы можем подумать о том, как нацелиться на студентов из экономически неблагополучных семей.
 Поэтому я думаю, что есть некоторые проблемы, но, как я уже сказал, направление ясно, и нам нужно двигаться в этом направлении, и мы сделаем все возможное, чтобы это произошло.</p>

 Первые контакты с пандемическими птицами сразу после выборов на фоне опасений по поводу состава комиссии.
 Необходимо определиться, куда мы хотим идти.
 Выберем ли мы новый комитет?
 Кто-то проявил интерес.
 Теперь нам нужно сформировать комитет, потому что я понимаю беспокойство Дженни.
 Я также хочу убедиться, что здание подходит для детей.
 Так что я думаю, что есть один
 Я думаю, что есть золотая середина между ничегонеделанием и некоторыми необходимыми улучшениями, чтобы поддерживать здание в хорошем состоянии.
 Эту форму использует студент.
 Но самое главное, мы должны определить состав комитета по видению, что нам нужно и сроки, которые мы думаем.
 Возможно, конец июня – не время начинать.
 я вижу

 Я имею в виду, что я решительно поддерживаю ремонт некоторых ванных комнат в кампусе, потому что они нуждаются в ремонте и обновлении.
 Я согласен, что нам нужен более подробный план, но самая современная ванная комната во всем здании находится в научном районе.
 Это на весь комплекс с настоящей современной ванной комнатой.
 Так что не все студенты учатся в этой области.
 Так что я надеюсь, что часть денег будет отложена в 2019 году и из-за всех вспышек и вспышек будут улучшены хотя бы некоторые исправления.
 Аминь, некоторые из этих ванных комнат.
 Я думаю, что это очень важно.
 И, знаете, я просто подумал о потребностях студентов и сказал, что хочу, чтобы у них была современная ванная комната.
