    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=208.272s">[David Murphy]</a>:  Thank you, Superintendent, Mayor, members of the school committee.
 It's a pleasure to be with you again this evening.
 for our fifth committee of the whole meeting focused on the FY22 budget.
 As the superintendent mentioned, tonight we'll be focused on elements of the central office, specifically the offices that are under both the superintendent and my own supervision.
 As we go through the beginning of the program, as we have each time, we'll be looking at the org chart and talking specifically about the offices whose budgets are
 are here in light of the fact that these are the offices that myself and the superintendent work most closely with.
 While Dr. Kuching, Ms.
 Galussi, Ms.
 Bowen are here, with the exception of Director McLaughlin, we will be really the only presenters and speakers tonight.
 But certainly we'll be eager to answer any questions that you have, both with respect to the offices that we are focusing on tonight and anything else that we've covered
 over the course of the last several weeks.
 And as I mentioned in my message to the committee, both last night and a few minutes ago, we will be having a budget update on the school committee agenda this coming Monday, May 24th.
 And we'll certainly be picking up questions and comments at that point, incorporating and taking in your feedback.
 And that will go into the development of the recommendations that come before you.
 prior to your June 1st statutory hearing.
 So with that, I will start, as we always do, with the timeline for our budget process, beginning with the development of the district's strategic goals and priorities, leading to a series of, some administrators might say, seemingly endless administrative meetings internally, in which we vet various proposals and comments, questions, and suggestions
 principles and evening, but have not been following along for each of the various budget presentations, both at regular school committee meetings, budget subcommittee and the committee of the whole meetings.
 This is where we are right now leading up to that June 1st public hearing in which members of the community will be invited to speak either for or against, or a favorite for those who follow municipal presentations, those wishing to speak neither for nor against.
 the budget in part or in whole.
 And again, that will take place on June 1st, but there will be a budget update on Monday, an opportunity to comment and engage in further discussion.
 We've used the org chart in each of these presentations, just as by way of showing folks, perhaps outside of the Medford Public Schools community,
 which area of the organization we're focused on in this particular meeting.
 So this is the overall org chart showing all the various offices and departments reporting up to the superintendent.
 And then these are the areas that we'll be discussing tonight.
 So you can see it's primarily the areas in my own portfolio, as well as those reporting directly to the superintendent.
 And you see the curvy arrow there on the right of the screen.
 which is indicating a reorganization of sorts that we'll be proposing as part of the FY22 budget, and that's something I'll be going into greater detail about shortly.
 So as we've discussed in each of the budget presentations, the funding for the Metro Public Schools and the funding generally for school districts across Massachusetts comes from various sources.
 What we often refer to as the Chapter 70 allocation, which is the
 The state contribution under state law coming out of ed reform law of 1993 and the funding that each school community and district are entitled to.
 The local contribution, which is the revenue generated from at the local level that is air marked for the for the school department, which in Medford is a very sizable portion of that of the overall
 operating budget.
 And then the sort of extenuating circumstances under which we're currently operating mean we have a significant influx of federal funding coming in as a result of the COVID-related legislation that has come in.
 And that is coupled with the sort of standing external funds that come in on a year-in and year-out basis, particularly in the area of special education, which we discussed at length at the May 6th Committee of the Whole when we heard from the Office of Pupil Services.
 We've said that throughout the FY22 budget, we've asked those contributing to the development of this budget, meaning our department heads and our principals, to focus essentially on three primary buckets of areas in which we're asking them what are their budgetary priorities, what are their needs, what are their challenges.
 First is personnel and staffing.
 And the committee certainly said before that when we're talking about school budgets, we're almost always talking about people.
 We're an organization made up of people, educating people, hoping to make them better people and people who are positioned to do well in their post-secondary lives.
 But that is always going to be the largest chunk of our budget because, you know, as we say sometimes in school finance, we're not focused on widgets.
 We're focused on people in a community, and that's always going to be the largest chunk.
 Materials and infrastructure, particularly under the challenging conditions under which we're operating, are always going to represent
 another, albeit smaller, aspect of the budget.
 And training and professional development, which everything is, we are looking at everything through a post-COVID context, but for training and professional development, when we think about the ways in which some of the inequities, both within public education and society at large, have come into sharper relief as a result of the experience that we've all lived through, we are thinking very much in that context when we talk about
 what are our professional development and training priorities, and what is it that we're looking to invest in.
 And particularly when we're talking about the superintendent's priorities, while much of what we're planning will be supported by external funding, given that the budget development process is the opportunity to really look at the organization as a whole, see how we're structured, how we're organized, what it is that we're pursuing, what are our discrete challenges, what are our long-term overarching challenges,
 This really is an opportunity to sort of pull the veil back on all of the Medford Public Schools.
 And my hope would be that throughout these committee of the whole presentations, as we've heard from the various directors and school leaders, my hope would be that both for the school committee and the members of the community who are either watching this in real time or perhaps watching it subsequent to the presentations, you'll see the effort toward transparency that we have employed to try to demonstrate for the community exactly what it is that we're doing.
 And I hope also
 the rationale behind these priorities.
 And this slide talks a little bit about that rationale in that these are the questions that were posed that led to the development of these priorities and that we're thinking about what are the targeted and intensive interventions that we can invest in to help reduce or eliminate the learning or opportunity gaps that have either been caused by or exacerbated by the disruption to instruction that our students have faced as a result of
 the COVID-19 pandemic.
 And so there will come a time when our budgetary priorities and our goals are not informed fully by this experience and the disruption that our students have lived through.
 At least I certainly hope that's the case.
 One of the sort of constant refrains that we go back to is we're looking to make investments that will ensure our students' academic careers are not defined by this experience.
 And hopefully if we make these investments and we execute on them wisely, that will be the case.
 But for right now,
 coming out of these, as cliche as it might sound, these unprecedented circumstances, we are looking to see how do we use the funding that's available to us from the local, state, and federal levels to try to put them in the best position possible despite the chaos that we've all lived through.
 So on April 26th, we presented to the school committee the projections that we were looking at based on the preliminary information that we had.
 uh, leading into these budget presentations.
 And we've estimated that, uh, the necessary increase in the budget would be somewhere between 3.4 and $5.8 million.
 Recognizing that there are a significant number of variables that are, uh, essentially not clear while variable one, there are restrictions on federal funding flowing in that are still not particularly clear.
 And I appreciate the mayor's comments to that effect.
 last night, but we're continuing to engage in a very constructive dialogue with our partners in the city government and reaching out to our partners at the state level and elsewhere to try to get clarity on that.
 I think at this point we feel comfortable that the priorities we've developed that we think of as having a strong nexus to the disruption caused by COVID will be essentially eligible expenses.
 It's a question of, from an administrative perspective, exactly how
 we'll go about processing those and exactly how realistic is it to do that.
 So I think we feel good about the priorities that we've identified as our COVID-related or potential ESSER-related priorities, but there's still a lot of clarity that needs to come into view in the coming weeks.
 In addition to that, we know we have fixed costs as every district does on a year-on-year basis.
 These are costs that are related to contractual obligations or
 other situations that have essentially predated the development of this budget, but we know that they're going to lead to an increase in costs.
 Other variables also include the fact that we have upwards of nine collective bargaining agreements that are expiring either at the conclusion of this school year or the conclusion of the summer.
 And so that's certainly a factor that we have to take into account as we work through the development of this budget.
 This is just information related to those external funding, the numbers the committee has seen several times before, so I won't
 belabor it, but we estimate about a $7.6 million ESSER budget over the next several years.
 And so I wouldn't say that we necessarily see that as needing to be expended in equal installments over the three or four year period that we have.
 But I would say that we want to be mindful of the fact that we're going to have additional data that will hopefully point us to more strategic uses of the funding as time goes on.
 So it may be the case that some of the more immediate expenses are in the short term, but the better use of the funding could be in year two or year three.
 And for that reason, we are looking to be, I'm not sure I would use the word conservative, but certainly cautious and cognizant of the implications of using that funding.
 And the fact is, as you've heard me say several times, these are one-time funds and the ESSER funding will not last forever.
 And so we have to be mindful of the uses
 being taking care to not create unnecessary structural deficits, and at the same time, making sure that we're being responsive to the urgent needs of students.
 And so where we strike that equilibrium is a big part of the conversations that we have been having and that we will be having.
 So I'm going to pause for one second before we move on to buildings and grounds and just talk a little bit about what you'll see over the next couple of slides in this, but I'm glad that I flashed to it quickly so that I can tell
 Mr. McLaughlin that he's on next as I continue to babble for another minute or so.
 But the departments that you're seeing starting with buildings, we're going to start with buildings and grounds and then move to the more umbrella offices of the superintendent's office and the office of finance and operations.
 And if you think back to the organizational chart that we saw at the beginning of the presentation, you can see that for both myself and Dr. Edouard-Vincent, there are a lot of priorities and funding and strategic investments
 and proposals that cut across the different departments and offices that you've already heard from.
 And that's a good thing because what we don't want to do is present a budget to you in the form of 25 siloed or overly departmentalized mini organizations.
 We want common themes and common strategic priorities that cut across.
 And so what you'll see in the bullets that we've identified are pieces that are either reflective of those priorities
 or operational pieces that are meant to put us in a position that we'll be able to actually pursue those priorities and do so successfully.
 Similar to the information technology budget proposals that we discussed in last night's committee of the whole, a large portion, arguably all, frankly, of the buildings and grounds priorities, the year maintenance issue,
 uh, that is essentially routine.
 I think routine was the word that we used in the technology presentation.
 That's something that we typically are going to incorporate one way or another into our operating budget.
 Um, something that is a one-time expense and I'm using the term one time in the context of municipal budgeting.
 And so one time could mean every 10 years, every 15 years, every 20 years, but certainly not on an annual basis.
 Um, that's every 20 years, but certainly not on an annual basis.
 That's something that we're going to look up to as a capital expense that we're going to try to keep off the operating budget for purposes of not creating some of those deficits that we've talked about.
 What we do when we have a large influx of federal funding, frankly, similar to how we handled the funding that came in during FY21, and to some extent in FY20 as well, is to try to address some of the most urgent priorities and needs that might in another context be considered a capital expense.
 but in light of the urgency, we're looking to just take what funding is available and make sure that that's addressed.
 That was certainly the case as is reflected in the buildings and grounds budget narrative that was provided to you today with regard to our HVAC repairs that we needed to expedite and accelerate at the beginning of this school year for purposes of getting students and staff back into the physical school buildings.
 And so I expressed my appreciation for Mr. McLaughlin and members of his team who partnered with
 the external experts that we brought in to make that a reality.
 The history as to how we got to the place where so much work was necessary, I think, has been addressed at length in previous meetings.
 But however we got here, we are in a much better position from an air quality perspective because that work was done throughout the course of this year.
 And now we're looking at some of the other heavy infrastructure pieces that may not land in the operating budget for FY22.
 but are critical priorities that need to be addressed in the near term.
 And I'm going to ask Mr. McLaughlin, if he could, to walk us through some of these.
 As we're talking about how these investments need to be made in the coming year or months.
 So John, do you want to take it from there and just start maybe with the generator and transformer electrical issues that we have
 been identified at the high school and at the Andrews and then we'll walk through some of the other pieces.
 From there we'll move on to finance operations in the superintendent's office and then we'll go to questions after that.

 它的油量很低，但仍在运行，但它肯定是应该优先考虑的事情，因为它还运行着大约三分之一的功率。
 在梅德福高中。
 然后我们将准备好定价信息以继续推进。
 显然，这将是一个带有发电机的夏季项目，只要我们准备好承担该项目即可。
 今年我们进行了一些安全改进。
 我们有一个新的 Raptor 系统。
 当时我安装了所有显示器，并接受了新 Raptor 系统的培训。
 如果你不知道猛禽系统是你进来的地方，你给自己一个许可证，他们会扫描它。
 如果一切顺利，您将收到一个标签，并准备好前往总办公室办理您在我们任何学校需要办理的业务。
 因此，我们希望每三四年完成一次停车场。
 我应该说，通常是整个系统范围内的所有这些。
 停车场又被标记了，它们开始老化了。
 我们想做一些
 梅福德高中的调整，我们将就残疾人停车情况与该学校会面。
 我知道我们在谈论主入口时进行了这样的对话。
 我认为我们想要做的是搬到梅福德高中前面的残疾人专用点，并进入那里的残疾人坡道。
 所以，你知道，让我们回顾一下。
 我和
 Lungo-Koehn 市长上周表示，如果我需要帮助，我们在市政厅有交通部门，他们会非常乐意帮助我们。
 几年前，我们与他们会面，试图做出一些改进，但众所周知，过去的一年并不是我们通常处理的典型年份。
 柯蒂斯塔夫茨锅炉项目，所以去年冬天，锅炉开始泄漏。
 这些都是我们可能会在下周的小组委员会会议上讨论的问题。
 这就是为什么我们订购了一些需要重新安装的部件，即分段部件。
 因此，我们得到了两个部分，他们将更换它们，这应该可以阻止我们预期的泄漏。
 我们将不得不在这方面花费大量资金。
 和暖通空调的改进。
 所以我们知道我们做了很多这样的事情。
 我们目前正在打开空调。
 因此，存在与此相关的问题，某些特定区域需要我们聘请承包商来修复。
 根据法律规定，我们必须在 5 月 15 日之前提供供暖。
 所以这周是我们进行结算的一周。
 不幸的是，本周很热，你知道，这很愚蠢，但这周很热。
 教室里的一些老师感到有点不舒服，但我们正在努力解决。
 我们知道你在那里。
 我们将尽快出去处理所有需要做的事情。
 致电承包商。
 我只是想列出一份我们需要做的事情以及需要做的建筑物的清单。
 嗯，浴室改造项目。
 戴夫和我会见了建筑师。
 嗯，我想我们只是在等待获得许可来查看并制作该项目的 RFP。
 是，我知道这是一个，嗯，
 梅福德高中项目对于改善浴室的许多人来说都是很亲近的。
 我们想要它，我知道。
 市长让我们看看我们能生产多少。
 我想如果我们能得到一个价格，我们就会知道我们在哪里，然后我们就可以从那里走得尽可能远。
 我们仍在等待主入口修复工程。
 看看我们要做什么。
 我们的一个在清洁办公室工作的人是一名瓦工，所以他主动提出出去尝试修复一点墙壁，花岗岩墙。
 所以今天他在那里工作。
 我的意思是，我希望我能让它看起来更好一点，但它仍然会
 什么，是什么，所以你知道我们当然可以在主入口见面，我想我们将在下周和小组委员会讨论并讨论我们希望如何推进这一点。
 这就是为什么我每年都会在预算范围内订购一辆带犁的卡车。
 所以这并没有改变。
 这肯定会对降雪有所帮助，也肯定会对整个地区的其他杂项项目有所帮助。
 如果我们有一辆带犁的卡车。
 所以，你知道，我可以多次帮助 DPW，因为他们行动非常迅速。
 而且，你知道，有时有些区域需要修补，但他们无法返回，因为主要目标是城市周围的道路。
 因此，拥有这样的东西肯定会有助于提高效率。
 由我们处置，接机。
 现在，我想，现在的剧院正在翻修，如果你看到我的预算前报告的话。
 如果我有一个希望看到成果的项目，那就是添加空调、栏杆、更新门以及在剧院进行一些电气工作。
 几年前我得到了一个价格，现在的价格不同了：在剧院的天花板上加装一台空调需要 10 万美元。
 我认为这对社区也有好处。
 也为学校创造收入，也许在某个时候将其添加到我们的资本改进清单中。
 但是，就像我说的，如果我可以选择我想做的高中项目，那将是我的主要项目之一，即改造项目。
 我们一直致力于学校的暖通空调改进项目。
 你知道，在某些时候，也许我们可以从 MSBA 获得帮助，也许我们可以添加空调以及梅福德高中目前没有空调的其他部分，这意味着科学实验室是建筑物中唯一有空调的真正部分。
 服务，你知道，除了我们到处都有的窗式空调。
 所以看不到底部。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=2280.431s">[David Murphy]</a>: 谢谢你，博士。
 然后去财务和运营办公室。
 正如您所看到的，这里有一些不同点。
 我将重点关注三个方面，包括交通，我认为它有自己的幻灯片，而且确实如此，谢谢。
 但首先，前两个，这是在昨晚的演讲中提到的。
 我认为这是在英语学习部门确定的优先事项的背景下发生的。
 想要投资一个机会来发展我们的努力，主要是我们的家庭承诺和社区关系。
 我当时指出，我们没有确定 22 财年对 EL 部门的具体投资的部分原因是我们从该地区获得了一项投资，我们希望能够推动这一事业，我们将为此努力。
 与 EL 部门、卫生服务部门、特殊教育部门等密切合作。
 我认为，当我们考虑如何构建组织以及如何组织特定的工作组合时，作为一般规则，最佳实践是确定需求，确定正在满足的需求或由于其他变化变量而正在发展的需求，
 然后确定如何最好地开发适合组织结构的角色和组合，以促进这些目标。
 然而，有时会出现多种事件同时发生的情况，我们的领导人员具有可用的能力和不断出现且变得更加紧迫的需求。
 这种融合发生在整个学年。
 老实说，引起我们注意的方式之一是当我们需要将整个行政部门转移到学校担任代课教师时。
 当我们清楚地意识到这令人筋疲力尽且几乎不可能时，我们试图做出不同的修改，我们的课前和课后规划主任继续自愿承担这项工作，并继续与我们沟通，就像她一段时间以来所做的那样，她觉得
 他的投资组合中有空间容纳额外的责任和信心类型，以及我们作为经理和领导者所拥有的个人能力。
 事实上，我们能够度过本学年，但通过能够确定我们可以在父母和家庭参与领域改进和更好地工作的做法，
 我指望黛安·考德威尔（Diane Caldwell）的帮助，她是我们的前副总监，曾担任家长信息中心的高级主任。
 我要说的是，作为一个新来这个学区的人，我在第一周继承了家长信息中心作为我的投资组合的一部分，没有夫人。
 考德威尔，
 如果能够提供这种领导力、指导和机构知识，这将是更具挑战性的一年，不仅是在对 PIC 的监督方面，而且在我和其他高级管理人员负责的工作的几乎所有其他要素方面。
 但我们从一开始就知道，
 考德威尔担任家长信息中心的管理员并不是一个永久的解决方案，他试图在内部运作
 在我们的预算范围内，我们不一定打算为家长信息中心主任作为一个没有其他职责的单一职位提供资金。
 然后是夫人。
 Fidler 表达了承担额外责任的意愿和热情。
 我们认为家长信息中心与贫困学校和缺勤学校计划之间有着紧密的自然联系，以及额外的支持
 呃，我们需要的能力，嗯，我们需要在家庭关系、交通方面的能力。
 嗯，我们认为这适合作为一个合法的、全面的管理组合。
 因此，作为 22 财年预算的一部分，我们建议将这些办公室重组为一般家庭参与区域，其中包括对家长信息中心的监督、对课前和课后计划的持续监督。
 以及交通连接等服务。
 现在，坦率地说，所有这些角色组合在一起的原因之一是它们是学年的不同部分，需要更大程度的关注和细节。
 这就是为什么我说这是一种融合，因为它非常适合与已经具备机构知识的人一起创建一个完整的 12 个月的角色。
 并在过去为该地区做出了出色的工作。
 这就是为什么能够有效地做到这一点，同时也对如何更有效地推进学区围绕家庭和社区伙伴关系的目标充满信心，是制定该提案的一部分。
 所以这是一场戏。
 然后你会看到，正如昨晚也提到的，
 我们设立了赠款协调员职位。
 这本身是一个非预算的事情，它不一定会对运营预算和赠款产生影响，这个人基本上一直担任非官方赠款协调员一段时间，但从技术上讲，在行政助理的角色中，我们已经能够将该人调到财务和运营办公室，与米歇尔·金登和她的团队合作，以确保我们
 履行我们的所有义务并尽可能有效地从合规角度执行。
 这是不同的，我想强调这一点。
 这当然与我们目前没有的拨款写作角色不同，但我们正在探索其他方法来释放一些能力，让管理员有机会更好地培养外部合作伙伴关系和
 并寻找赠款机会，以便我们的赠款协调员能够帮助协调并尝试以这种方式释放额外的预算能力。
 在我们谈论交通之前，我想再说一遍，这是我们昨晚谈话的延续。
 在本学年中，我们继续与 Management Solution 和 Paquette 先生保持合作关系，Paquette 先生担任临时代理
 夫人之间的业务管理员
 帕特森和我。
 我们已准备好委托提交给学校委员会的报告。
 基本上，我要求对报告进行附录，因为该报告是在整个学年中准备的，并在某种程度上促进了预算制定过程。
 我问帕克特先生，根据我们仍然拥有的预付款，
 基本上，您可以填写一些补充内容，其中会考虑到我们所做的一些更改，夫人。
 Kimu 和我在过去的几个月里将这一点付诸实践。
 这就是为什么我预计在本财年结束之前将其提交给委员会。
 然后，帕克特先生，我们与塔夫茨大学的合作伙伴关系，一开始只是测试合作伙伴关系，后来发展为对话。
 在技​​术基础设施的背景下，我希望我们整个夏天都能非常有效地从中受益。
 但随后我们还将探讨在展望 2022 财年时我们应该保留或可能参考的其他外部知识。
 这是一个高层次的概述。
 我将结束交通，然后继续回答您的问题。
 如果您还记得当我们谈论 22 财年的预测时，我们的成本增加了约 51,000。
 我必须快速地说，这些是因为它们是在 5 月 6 日解决的。
 这些与我们与特殊教育相关的固定交通成本无关。
 这是我们的主要供应商东方巴士。
 学校委员会于 2020 年春季签订了一份为期三年的新合同。
 所以，我们正在完成其中的第一个。
 的三年合同。
 与合同一样，成本逐年增加。
 因此，我们预计该合同将增加约 51,000 美元，作为我们预计固定成本增加 210 万美元的一部分。
 4 月 26 日，当提出有关 MBTA 通行证的请求时，您已经看到了以下两个数字。
 这本质上是我们的一个选择
 确保委员会知道。
 然后还有一些问题，涉及额外黄色巴士的基本成本以及在高中提供额外东区巴士容量的可能性。
 我们估计约为 75,000 美元。
 我之所以说它是零到 75,000 美元，是因为在我们与供应商的对话中，他们有，
 我认为，并且我很欣赏这一点，我不知道是否所有提供商都会这样做，但他们建议，根据本学年之前该学区采用的半径，就初中和高中交通而言，有可能重新调整我们现有的一些能力，以提供至少一辆额外的巴士到高中。
 下周我们将与
 巴士提供商以及梅德福警察局，我们将在那里讨论一系列问题，既与安全有关，也与规划即将到来的夏季学年的路线和站点的开发有关。
 所以，坦率地说，我目前没有向委员会提出关于是否应该增加第二辆公共汽车的任何建议。
 我认为很明显我们可以做到这一点。
 所以我认为问题在于查看有关哪里的数据
 什么是高中生以及是否有需求。
 我要说的是，在我与中等教育管理部门的简短对话中，我们根本不清楚是否知道对此有明确的需求，但我认为我们要牢记这一点。
 但与此同时，如果为学生提供更方便的服务的成本在 0 到 75,000 美元之间，那么显然我们会考虑这一点。
 我认为从战略角度来看，我们需要牢记 MBTA 通行证显然有可能提供更多的准入机会。
 而且，你知道，你开始考虑学生工作、去城市的机会。
 城市还有其他类型的体验，例如 MBTA 通行证可以为学生提供的课堂和体验式学习体验。
 我们正在考虑所有这些选择。
 贯穿所有演示的一个共同点是，我们决心在 21-22 学年为学生建立有效的延长上课日和课外活动计划，利用 ESSER 资金确保我们在学生面临重大干扰后提供尽可能最大的恢复支持。
 因此，我感谢您抽出时间并在这方面给予我宽容。
 如果你喜欢我可以提供更多证词和证人的演示，我保证我也更喜欢它们。
 但这些是建筑物和土地、财务和运营办公室以及主管办公室的记录。
 此时，我将很乐意回答您的问题。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3062.978s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: شكرا لك أيها السيد.
 لدينا شاحنات صغيرة للأعضاء المقربين ثم لأعضاء روسو.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3068.903s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: شكرا لك
 في النهاية سأذهب لتحريك الحافلة المدرسية.
 ديف، لقد قدمت لنا بعض الخيارات المثيرة للاهتمام، ولكن مع وجود فرق كبير في السعر.
 عند هذه النقطة، عند إنشاء هذه الميزانية،
 من أنت وهل ستقدم لنا؟
 هيا يعني كيف نبدأ؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3100.169s">[David Murphy]</a>: حسنًا، أعتقد أن القرار الأولي الأول كان ما إذا كانت اللجنة تفضل نصف القطر المعتمد العام الماضي على نصف قطر ميل واحد لجميع الصفوف باستثناء رياض الأطفال.
 لذا، إذا كان هذا ما تريد اللجنة الاحتفاظ به
 هذا يعني أن البائع يقول بالتأكيد أنه سيكون هناك الكثير منهم في المدرسة الابتدائية.
 لذا فإن عقد الحافلات الحالي، الذي تبلغ تكلفته حوالي 1.4 مليون دولار، سيمنحنا حافلة مدرسية إضافية، والتي أعتقد أننا يجب أن نفكر في استخدامها في المدارس الثانوية لزيادة الطاقة الاستيعابية.
 سؤالي الوحيد
 وبخلاف ذلك، يمكننا التحول إلى برنامج ما بعد المدرسة وتمديد اليوم الدراسي دون تكبد تكلفة إضافية محتملة قدرها 100000 دولار.
 أو على الأقل يستحق الدفع مقابله.
 لذا أعتقد أن القرار الأول هو ما إذا كان المجلس راضيًا عن نصف قطر الأميال، والذي يقول مقدمو الخدمة إنه ليس مشكلة كبيرة.
 هذا هو المكان الذي نحن فيه.
 إذا كان الأمر كذلك
 لذلك أعتقد أن الخطوة التالية هي النظر في البيانات المتعلقة بالمكان الذي يعيش فيه طلاب المدارس الثانوية وما إذا كانت هناك طريقة مفيدة لمعرفة مكان تواجد الطلاب.
 مرة أخرى، أعتقد أن الجانب السلبي الوحيد لهذا البرنامج هو أنه مع موافقة MBTA، فإنهم لا يوصلونك إلى المدرسة فقط.
 أعتقد أنه بالنسبة لطلاب المدارس الثانوية بشكل خاص، هناك الكثير من الفرص التجريبية التي يمكن أن تقدمها لهم MBTA Transit.
 آخر شيء أريد قوله هو أنه إذا ربطنا البرنامج بشرائه، فإن رمز MBTA يصبح استثمارًا أفضل.
 أعتقد أن هذا قد يستغرق بعض الوقت، وربما يكون الصيف وقتًا كافيًا لمرشدينا لتطوير هذه الأنواع من الفرص للتأثير على التأثير المحتمل لهذه الاستثمارات.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3230.138s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: لذا، ديف، دعنا نعود إلى ما قلته عن الأميال المقطوعة.
 ويجب أن أقول إنني لم أتخلف عن الانتخابات.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3239.024s">[David Murphy]</a>: لذا... هذا سابق لوقتي، لكنني أفهم أنه عندما يتم عرض هذه الخطة المدروسة بعناية على لجنة المدرسة، وهي خطة متعددة الوظائف، فإن البث الإذاعي يكون جزءًا منها.
 ونتيجة لذلك، تم تحسين الطرق والتوقفات.
 اعتقدت ذلك وعرفت أنني أعرف ذلك.
 وذلك لأن الركاب قد تراجعوا كثيرًا هذا العام، وعادةً ما ستخرج من محطة الحافلات وتسمع الإجابة الأساسية، لكن هذا لم يحدث هذا العام.
 ومن المحتمل أيضًا أن يكون عدد الركاب قد انخفض بشكل كبير بسبب انتشار الوباء.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3280.253s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: نعم، أعتقد أنه من المفهوم تمامًا أن عدد ركابنا قد انخفض بشكل ملحوظ.
 أعلم أن هناك طلابًا في ميدفورد يستقلون الحافلة بسبب مخاوف بشأن حركة المرور والسلامة على الطرق في المكان الذي يعيشون فيه.
 لذلك تقول هذه الأتمتة أن الأتمتة هي ميل واحد، والأتمتة ليست ميلًا واحدًا أبدًا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3307.655s">[David Murphy]</a>: الشيء الرئيسي هو أنني أعتذر عن هذا.
 إذا كنت تعتقد أن الأمر واضح، فإن البرق لا علاقة له بالسلامة.
 ستكون محطة الحافلات الخاصة بك جزءًا من محادثتنا الأسبوع المقبل.
 لذلك، لا يوجد هنا ممثلون وبائعون محليون فحسب، بل أيضًا الشرطة البلدية.
 لأنه عندما نقوم بدراسة ونحلل الطرق والمواقع، نريد التأكد من أن أي مجال مثير للقلق قد تم فحصه بدقة من قبل خبراء السلامة العامة و
 ليس هناك شك في أن الاستثناءات من قواعد الأمان لها الأسبقية على أي سياسة متعلقة بالبث.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3344.167s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: حسنًا، كما تعلمون، بعض هذا يعتبر سريًا أو موجودًا منذ فترة طويلة وأي حركة لإزالته لا بد أن تكون مزعجة.
 يبدو الأمر متفائلاً للغاية عندما تقول إنه سيكون لدينا مساحة وسنكون قادرين على استخدام الحافلة الحالية.
 يبدو ديف متفائلًا بالنسبة لي، وأنا متفائل بشكل عام، لكنني لست مستعدًا للتداول بين الاثنين.
 نعم، فوق 350 وهذا تغيير كبير.
 وهناك بعض الأشياء التي يمكنني قولها لأن الكثير من الناس يجدون صعوبة في فهم ما ننفق عليه ميزانيتنا بالضبط.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3389.268s">[David Murphy]</a>: نعم، هذه كلها نقاط جيدة.
 ولكي نكون واضحين، فإن هذه البيانات تجيب على أسئلة اللجنة.
 لا، لا أعرف، ولا أعرف حقًا من أين أتى هؤلاء الـ 350 ألف شخص.
 لذا قل الحقيقة.
 هذا هو الحال</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3403.415s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: هذا صحيح.
 وفي الوقت نفسه، أنا ممتن لزملائي على إثارة هذه القضية لأنها مسألة عدالة.
 لذلك أعتقد أنه من الواضح أننا سنجري المزيد من المحادثات حول ذلك.
 جيد جدًا.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3453.891s">[David Murphy]</a>: لا، ولكن هذا فقط لأنه يعيش على الأموال التي ينفقها على الرياضة أو الفنون.
 سيتم إعادة تنشيط هذه الكابلات خلال السنة الضريبية الخاصة بك.
 لن يتم قطع أي منها أبدًا، ولكن سيتم الحفاظ عليها أو إعادتها إلى وضعها السابق في السنة المالية 2020.
 لذا تأكد من أن لدينا وسائل نقل مناسبة لجميع الأنشطة والأحداث الرياضية والمزيد.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3661.661s">[David Murphy]</a>: لا، هذا سؤال جيد.
 أعتقد أنك على حق.
 أعني أنه في بعض الأحيان هناك اختلافات.
 أعتقد أكثر
 ويحدث هذا الاختلاف بين المناطق بسبب النظام العالمي الموجود حول ألعاب القوى.
 أعتقد أن هذا هو السبب الذي يجعلك ترى هذا الاختلاف في كثير من الأحيان، لكنهم يلعبون دورًا مشابهًا للجزء من برنامجنا التعليمي الذي يجذب الطلاب ويجلبهم إلى هنا للاستمتاع بصراحة وتحقيق أقصى استفادة من تعليمهم.
 لذلك أنا متحمس للنظر في الأمر ومعرفة ما إذا كان موجودًا.
 هل هناك أي عيوب قد نحتاج إلى مساعدة لإصلاحها؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3704.757s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: شكرا لك
 لذلك قررت أن أطرح سؤالاً آخر رأيته في مشروع الحمام.
 مرة أخرى، هذه هي سنتي الرابعة والسنة الرابعة من الطلاب الذين يحاولون إيجاد طرق لتوفير منتجات الدورة الشهرية لطلابنا.
 يا للعار.
 لا أعرف إذا كان الجميع في هذا الاجتماع يوافقون على هذا، لكن الأمر صعب للغاية.
 تم تشغيل مشروع CCSR لمدة أربع سنوات متتالية لضمان عدم مواجهة الطلاب الموسميين لصعوبات في الوصول إلى هذه المنتجات.
 لقد كان مثيرا للاهتمام.
 أريد فقط أن أوضح أنني لن أصوت لأي شخص.
 تجديد الحمام إذا تم تجديد كل حمام، فلا يوجد موزع موسمي مجاني.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3762.382s">[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>: دكتور إدوارد فنسنت؟
 سيد روسو، أريد فقط أن أعلق على أنه منذ أن كتبت هذا، فأنت تعتقد أنه عندما يستخدم الطلاب في المدرسة الثانوية الحمامات ولا يُسمح لهم باستخدام المنتجات النسائية، يكون لدينا مكتب طبي كامل.
 يتم استخدام المنتجات النسائية في الحمام، ولكن للأسف يتم في بعض الأحيان استخدام المنتجات النسائية لأغراض أخرى.
 تم استخدامها لتزيين الحمامات وتم تركيبها في النهاية على السقف.
 لقد حدث هذا عدة مرات.
 هذا حمام متحكم فيه ومراقب.
 لذلك قمنا بدعوتكم طلاب CCSR وقمت بهذا المشروع، ولكن أريد أن يعرف الجميع أن المنتجات النسائية متوفرة في المكتب الطبي ولا يتم منع الوصول إليها.
 لدينا العديد من المنتجات في المجال الطبي وأنا لست ضد توفير الآلات التي يمكن للطلاب استخدامها، ولكن أريد فقط أن أشير إلى أننا عندما نعطيها، فإنهم لا يستخدمونها للأغراض التي يريدونها.
 وهذا هو أحد أسباب استبعادهم من الماضي.
 لذلك أريد فقط أن أقول إننا لا نحاول التحدث إلى الطلاب أو إخبارهم بأن هذا غير موجود.
 أريد أن يعرف الجميع أنه متوفر وأن هناك عرضًا وافرًا في أماكن الرعاية الصحية الأولية والثانوية على وجه الخصوص.
 هذه الخدمة متاحة لجميع المواعيد.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3866.52s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: شكرا لك
 أيها العمدة، سيكون أمرا رائعا لو تمكنت من الرد بسرعة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3869.988s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: لذلك، هناك مشارك كريتز.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3872.29s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: نعم، أنا أفهم.
 لا أنصح أي شخص أبدًا بمحاولة إنكار هذه الأشياء.
 أقترح ببساطة أخذ خريطة للمدرسة وتخيل الطالب في أبعد نقطة من المستشفى.
 أعني، من بين جميع أعضاء لجنة الدراسة، أنا الوحيد هنا.
 لم يكن لديه مثل هذه الخبرة.
 أنا فقط أضع افتراضات عنكم جميعًا، لكن، كما تعلمون، حتى أنا لا أستطيع أن أتخيل أنهم بعيدون جدًا عن المركز الطبي في هذا المبنى الكبير، وتقولون إنكم تعرفون مكانه.
 مشيت عبر المبنى لأرى كيف يبدو.
 قلت، أولاً، هذه ليست مسافة دقيقتين سيراً على الأقدام.
 أي أننا نقول لا أعلم متى ولكني أعتقد
 إن ما نعتبره حاجز الدخول يبدو مرتفعًا جدًا أو مرتفعًا جدًا، وفي الواقع لا يوجد أي تشابه.
 أعلم أن هناك مناطق أخرى فعلت ذلك وأنا لم أفعل ذلك، فهي ليست مشكلة كبيرة في الصفحات الأولى في العالم.
 أعلم أن ما قرأته عن الصحة ليس نشاطًا شبابيًا صحيًا، لقد نسيت ما يتطلبه القانون في المدرسة العام الماضي.
 ولكن هناك مواقف أولية عندما تقوم بتثبيتها ومنحها مجانًا، فإنها تلتصق بالسقف ويمكن للأطفال الذين يحتاجون إليها أن يأخذوا سلة كاملة إلى المنزل.
 ولكن مثل أشياء كثيرة، يمكن أن تكون مملة.
 وبعد ذلك، عندما يحتاجها الطلاب، سيكونون هناك.
 لذلك لا أريد أن يكون هذا مشروعًا بسيطًا.
 أنا فقط أؤمن إيمانا راسخا
 CCSR، أعتقد أنه مشروع CCSR، وقد ظهر في صندوق الوارد الخاص بي على Facebook قبل أسبوع، وأعتقد أن الأمر يتعلق بالطلاب الذين يقومون بذلك.
 إنهم لا يفعلون ذلك لأنه ليس لديهم أي شيء آخر ليفعلوه.
 لذلك أعتقد أننا لا نستمع إلى طلابنا.
 إنني أعتبر موقع CCSR 2016 أحد مشاريع هذا العام.
 لا أعرف متى سنكون قادرين على القيام بذلك، لكن شكرًا لك.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4012.217s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: شكرًا لك، عضو الكونجرس كريست، وعضو الكونجرس جراهام، وعضو الكونجرس ماكلولين.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4015.74s">[Kathy Kreatz]</a>: حسنا، أريد فقط أن أشكرك.
 في البداية كانت لدي أسئلة فقط حول التسليم، ولكن أولاً أريدك أن تعرف أن هذا كان عرضًا تقديميًا رائعًا، يا ماكلولين، لقد قمت بعمل رائع وكان لديك جدول أعمال.
 وستكون هذه القضية على جدول الأعمال الأسبوع المقبل وسنناقشها في اجتماع اللجنة الفرعية الأسبوع المقبل.
 لذلك لدي سؤال آخر حول الشحن.
 لقد حدث شيء ما لأنني أدرجت هذه المعلومات لأنني لا أتذكرها في المرآة.
 لذلك قرأت مستشار النقل للألعاب الأولمبية لعام 2021 ويقول إن جميع المدارس العامة لن تقوم باستقبال أو توصيل الطلاب من مدرسة صفراء، حتى لو كان عنوانهم الفعلي يقع ضمن مسافة ميلين مدرسيين كاملين.
 نحن نعلم أن هذا التغيير يمثل عبئًا كبيرًا وسنقدم دائمًا خدمة الشحن بما يتجاوز هذا المبلغ.
 لذلك لست متأكدًا مما إذا كان لدي المعلومات الصحيحة.
 سيد ميرفي، ليس لدي أي معلومات عن الوضع الذي ذكرته.
 لا أتذكر اجتماعًا واحدًا حول هذا الموضوع.
 لذلك أريد فقط أن أتحدث عن هذا.
 أنا أعرفك
 تحدث فان دير دير عن هذا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4092.141s">[David Murphy]</a>: سيدي، أريد فقط أن أوضح.
 أقول هذا منكرًا أن هذا قد حدث قبل مجيئي إلى هنا، لكنني شاركت فيه منذ ذلك الحين.
 إذا كان أي من زملائي يرغب في مشاركة ذكرياته، من فضلك لا تفعل ذلك.
 لكن كما أوضحت عند إنشاء اللجنة، كان نصف القطر 2.0 ميل.
 أعلم أن هذا للمدرسة المتوسطة.
 مرة أخرى، هناك حد لهذا، كما أصبحت، أعتقد أنهم في المدرسة علموني حوالي ميل ونصف، لكن هذا لم يكن يعنيني.
 بالإضافة إلى ذلك، لتقليل صلابة الحافلة بأكملها، ينبغي نصح مقدمي الخدمة باعتماد نصف قطر ميل واحد في المستوى الأساسي ونصف قطر ميلين في المستوى الثانوي.
 مهلا، اقرأ هذا.
 بصراحة، انخفض عدد ركاب الحافلات كثيرًا لدرجة أنه من غير الواضح ما إذا كان مقدمو الخدمة بحاجة إلى فرض مسافة ميل واحد.
 وبالمناسبة، لا بد من القول أن هذا لا ينطبق على رياض الأطفال.
 لذلك، فإن الرفض هو رفض لسلامة المنطقة ورياض الأطفال والطلاب ذوي الإعاقة والنقل في خطة التعليم الفردية، والتي، بالطبع، لا تتضمن أيضًا هذه المحادثة.
 لكن نصف قطر الميل الواحد وبندقية الميلين يعتمدان على قيود كوفيد والآخر كذلك
 لنكون صادقين، فإن عدم الامتثال القسري للقيود ليس من غير المألوف في المجتمع، خاصة عندما تكون هناك مقاعد في الحافلة.
 وهذا ما سنفعله هذا الصيف، المسار المخطط له والتوقف عند الموردين بهذه السيارة.
 حذر المورد من أنه إذا فعلنا ذلك، فمن المرجح أن يتم توفير 18 حافلة لنا بموجب العقد.
 وبعد موافقة العام الماضي، نحتاج إلى أسطول مكون من 17 حافلة فقط، مما سيوفر 18 حافلة لتقديم خدمة حافلات مدرسية ثانية.
 اعتقدت يا دكتور كوشينغ أنني أراك ترفع يدك.
 إذا أخطأت، يرجى تصحيح لي.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4219.238s">[Peter Cushing]</a>: أنت تقول أنه لا يوجد شيء خاطئ.
 لقد كنت على حق.
 أعتقد أنه يمكنك القول إن أحد الجوانب الإيجابية للوباء هو أنه عزز بالفعل العلاقات بين المديرين.
 أعتذر لمسؤولي المدينة وأولياء الأمور لأخذنا على عاتقنا ضمان طريق آمن إلى المدرسة، وانبعاثات الوقود الأحفوري من خلال محطات الحافلات، وحافلة مدرسية سيرًا على الأقدام لتزويد الطلاب بطريقة آمنة للوصول من وإلى المدرسة.
 ودعونا ننظر إلى طرق أخرى للتأكد من أننا نمنح الأطفال الفرصة للذهاب إلى المدرسة بأمان، ولكن هذه أيضًا مشكلة سببها الوباء الذي كنا نفكر فيه جميعًا عندما أجرينا هذه المحادثة العام الماضي.
 يلتقون بالناس ويتوجهون إلى المدرسة.
 نتلقى بيانات خرائط نظم المعلومات الجغرافية من جميع مواقع الطلاب.
 ومع تباطؤ الوباء، أجرينا تحليلاً شاملاً لفحص كل هذا، ثم نظرنا في احتمال أن يؤدي الوباء إلى تغيير العادات والمواقف.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4309.15s">[Kathy Kreatz]</a>: شكرا لك
 شكرا لك
 لدي أيضًا أسئلة حول المعلومات الصحية المحتملة للعام الدراسي القادم.
 أبريل، لست متأكدًا من وصولك إلى هنا، لكن باترسون يعرف ذلك.
 منذ أن عدنا إلى المدرسة في يوم براهما مع MBTA، كنا قلقين من أن MBTA لن تكون متاحة لطلاب المدارس الثانوية في الأيام التي سبقت عيد العمال.
 وقبل أيام قليلة من عيد العمال، عاد الأطفال إلى المدرسة.
 أعلم أن لدينا رسائل نصية من الطلاب ينتظرون في محطة الحافلات وأن الحافلة ليست هناك.
 أنهوا المسير ووصلوا إلى المدرسة متأخرين.
 لذا استعد للعام الدراسي القادم.
 تمت إضافة حافلة صفراء وخلال الأيام القليلة الأولى، سيتم تشغيل بعض المحطات الأكثر تكرارًا للوصول إلى طلاب المدارس الثانوية.
 لا أتذكر كل التفاصيل، لكن أريدك فقط أن تعلم أن هذه مشكلة مستمرة.
 كل عام لأننا نبدأ قبل عيد العمال.
 بعد ذلك، بعد عيد العمال، ستعمل حافلة MBT خلال ساعات الدراسة العادية.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4398.254s">[David Murphy]</a>: النساء
 كيتز، أنا حقا أحب هذا.
 هذا ليس شيئًا قمت به من قبل.
 سأدرس بمفردي في أقرب وقت ممكن.
 سؤالي الأول هو: ماذا حدث لهذه الحافلة بعد عيد العمال؟
 لأنه لو حدث هذا الأسبوع، سأكون فضوليًا قليلاً بشأن كيف ولماذا حدث.
 كل ما أريد قوله هو</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4416.775s">[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>: هذه ممارسة قديمة في شركات الحافلات، والحزب والشرق يعرفون ذلك لأننا نفتح مدارس تمهيدية في عدة مناطق مجاورة، فالكثير منهم يفعلون نفس الشيء ويمكنهم إعداد حافلاتهم حتى نمر عبر المدارس ونذهب إلى المدرسة في مدارس أخرى.
 لذا يمكنك أن تفعل ما فعلته من قبل، وسنواصل بالتأكيد العمل مع أعضاء Kreatz.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4444.807s">[David Murphy]</a>: شكرا لك
 نعم، أعتقد أننا سنواصل القيام بذلك، وفي مؤتمر الحافلات الشرقية سأطرح أيضًا قضايا تتعلق بالقدرة لأنه عندما سمعت عن نقل المزيد من الحافلات الصفراء إلى المدارس الثانوية، فإن هذا ما يجب أن ننظر إليه.
 لذا مرة أخرى، سنجري الكثير من المحادثات ونصبح شركاء جيدين.
 تحظى بشعبية كبيرة في العام الماضي.
 لذلك آمل أن نتمكن من مواصلة التواصل معهم.</p>

 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំសង្ឃឹមថាយើងនឹងដោះស្រាយបញ្ហាចរាចរណ៍ម្តងទៀតហើយសង្ឃឹមថាអ្នករាល់គ្នានឹងសហការជាមួយក្រុមហ៊ុនឡានក្រុងភាគខាងកើតគឺនាយកដ្ឋានប៉ូលីសនិងទីភ្នាក់ងារផ្សេងទៀត។
 យើងសង្ឃឹមថាសហគមន៍អាចរកវិធីល្អបំផុតទៅមុខ។
 វេជ្ជបណ្ឌិត Cushing ខ្ញុំក៏ប្រាប់អ្នកផងដែរខ្ញុំចាំបានថាការសន្ទនាអំពីកាំមួយឬពីរម៉ាយល៍និងវត្ថុដូចនោះដែរអំពីការមិនមានកាំនៅកម្រិតបឋម។
 នៅពេលដែលលោក Murphy បាននិយាយអំពីមត្តេយ្យធ្វើជាករណីលើកលែងខ្ញុំគិតថាខ្ញុំចាប់ផ្តើមគិតថាប្រសិនបើបានអនុវត្ត
 មួយពាន់ធៀបនឹងពីរពាន់ឬអ្វីមួយដូចនោះ។
 ទោះយ៉ាងណាអ្នកនៅតែត្រូវយកកូនរបស់អ្នកនៅកន្លែងណាមួយដែលអ្នកមិនធ្លាប់មានពីមុនមក។
 តើអ្នកអនុវត្តយ៉ាងម៉េចហើយជានិស្សិតដែលមានលក្ខណៈជាសិស្សថ្នាក់មត្តេយ្យក្នុងរយៈពេល 4 កាំ?
 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំគិតថាមានការពិភាក្សាជាច្រើនអំពីការដឹកជញ្ជូនដែលចាំបាច់ត្រូវដោះស្រាយ។
 ប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំសង្ឃឹមថាថវិកាឆ្លុះបញ្ចាំងយ៉ាងច្បាស់ថានិស្សិតនឹងមិនមានការលំបាកក្នុងការចូលរៀននៅឆ្នាំក្រោយទេ។

 ហើយបញ្ហាមួយទៀតដែលខ្ញុំគិតថាយើងត្រូវដោះស្រាយគឺថានឹងមាននិស្សិតដែលចង់បានការបញ្ចុះតម្លៃ MBTA ឆ្លងកាត់។

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4879.947s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: إذن كيف تريد أن يتم تقديم الحل؟
 أبلغنا نائب الرئيس جراهام ومورفي أننا سنرى الأول من يونيو، وليس الأول من أغسطس.
 أعتقد أن الأمر واضح.
 لقد ذكرت الأول من أغسطس، أريد فقط أن أعرف ما الذي أدعمه وما هو متاح ومتى.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4905.178s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: وبالتالي فإن الميزانية ستتضمن افتراض أن البحث لا يكلف شيئا.
 لا يزال من المستحيل مراجعة خطط واستراتيجيات النقل.
 هذه هي الفترة التي تستمر حتى 1 أغسطس.
 وبشكل أكثر تحديدًا، هل MBTA مجانية للجميع أم أن هناك استراتيجية "الحافلة الصفراء" وهذا ما نقوم بتغييره؟
 وفي غضون ميل أو ميلين، يؤثر كل هذا بشكل واضح على الميزانية وأيضًا على ما حدث في المنطقة التعليمية بعد الموافقة على الميزانية.
 لكن الميزانية يجب أن تعكس القدرة على السماح لنا بالذهاب إلى المدرسة دون مطالبة الطلاب بالدفع.
 فهمت يا ميرفي؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4960.204s">[David Murphy]</a>: حسنًا، أعتقد أن الاعتراض الوحيد، وأنا لا أحاول حقًا الإشارة إلى ذلك، هو أنني لا أعتقد أننا نطلب من أي شخص دفع تكاليف المدرسة الآن.
 في الواقع، يركب بعض الطلاب حافلة MBTA ولا يوجد مقعد في الحافلة الصفراء لمدرستنا، لذلك يتعين عليهم اتخاذ خيارات بناءً على المكان الذي يعيشون فيه، أو حيث تعيش أسرهم، أو ظروف أخرى.
 لذا بالطبع فإنهم يدفعون مقابل الذهاب إلى المدرسة، ولكن ليس من سياسة المنطقة أننا لا نسمح لك بركوب حافلة MBTA طالما أنك تدفع ثمن حافلة MBTA التي تدفعها.
 لذلك أعتقد أننا نريد جمع بيانات عن عدد الطلاب الحاليين ونأمل أن ننظر إليها لفترة من الوقت ونرى ما إذا كانت MBTA تتجاوز الكمية التي نبيعها وتقبل حدود ما لدينا.
 لذلك أعتقد أننا سنرى ما إذا كان بإمكاننا خفض التكاليف من حيث زيادة سعة الحافلة الصفراء.
 لذلك أعتقد أنه عندما نبيع MBTA، علينا أن نراجعه لأنه كما قلنا من قبل، لا نريد تشجيع طلابنا على الاستفادة من الخصم.
 لذلك أعتقد أننا بحاجة إلى جمع بيانات البطاقة.
 هل يتم استخدام البطاقات على أساس التفضيل أم يتم شراؤها على أساس التفضيل أو عدم التفضيل؟
 طريقة أخرى للذهاب إلى المدرسة.
 لذلك أعتقد أن الهدف واضح.
 كما قلت، سنكون بخير وسنعود عندما نواجه وكالة حكومية أو عندما يبدو أن الشركة الناشئة مستحيلة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5066.605s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: أعضاء مجلس ماكلولين متحالفون مع الحركة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5068.707s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: شكرا لكم على هذه الحركة.
 فقط لنكون واضحين،
 من وجهة نظر واحدة، أعتقد أنني أحاول فقط التأكد من وجود شيء من هذا القبيل، ولكن المشكلة المرحب بها هي أن لدينا طلاب يدفعون الرسوم الدراسية، ومعظمهم محرومون اقتصاديًا.
 ربما ضمن دائرة نصف قطرها ميل، أو على الأقل ضمن دائرة نصف قطرها ميل.
 إذا كنت تفكر في تحديد عدد الكيلومترات في منطقة McGlynn بالقرب من مدرسة McGilney الثانوية، فاذهب سيرًا على الأقدام إلى المدرسة لأنهم لا يستطيعون شراءها مقابل 30 دولارًا شهريًا بخصم قد يكون له تأثير كبير على أسرهم.
 أعتقد أن هذا عادل
 الأخلاق هي بيان وميزانيتنا تعكس قيمنا وأعتقد أنني مندهش عندما أرى أنه تاريخيًا كان مجلس إدارة المدرسة يجلس على الجانب الآخر من المنصة وكان على الطلاب دفع ثمن ذلك.
 النقل المدرسي، خاصة لأنه طالب لا يستطيع، وعندما تفكر في معدل التغيب، كما تعلم، فإن ذلك له تأثير كبير، لذا فأنا أعرف MBTA، لكنني سأدع اللجنة المالية تفعل ذلك ودعنا نفعل ذلك.
 كما تعلمون، بمجرد قيامنا بتقييم ذلك، يمكننا معرفة المزيد حول تحليل التكلفة والعائد في الاجتماع التالي أو الأخير.
 لكنني أريد أن أضع ذلك جانبًا وأدعم خطوة السيد جراهام.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5169.127s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: مراجعة 1 يونيو.

 لا ينبغي أن يضطر أي طفل إلى دفع تكاليف النقل الخاصة به.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5205.937s">[David Murphy]</a>: آسف، لا أستطيع أن أفهم هذا.
 كان ينبغي علي أن أطرح هذا السؤال قبل أن يكمل، ولكني أردت فقط أن أطرح سؤالاً أوضح.
 نعم، هناك مقترح لإنشاء دائرة نصف قطرها 3 كيلومترات للمدرسة الثانوية لأنه وفقًا للسياسة الحالية، حتى لو تمت إزالة اللوحة الصفراء، فلن يحصل هؤلاء الطلاب على اللوحة الصفراء.
 لكنني لا أعرف، لا أعرف ما الذي تفعله بطاقة MBTA، ولكن إذا كان الطالب يعيش في مدرسة تبعد أربعة أميال، فسوف نتأكد من حصول الطالب على وسائل نقل مجانية.
 هل هناك قواعد مماثلة عند التفكير في كيفية الوصول إلى المدرسة؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5248.902s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: لا، أعني، إذا كان القانون يلزم الطلاب بالذهاب إلى المدرسة سيرًا على الأقدام، فأنا أوافق وأستمر في ذلك.
 الآن، أنا لا أطلب منك أن تأخذ قضمة من تلك التفاحة بنفسك.
 ما يقلقني هو الأشخاص الذين يعيشون على بعد أكثر من ثلاثة أميال (٣ كيلومترات) من المدرسة ويتعين عليهم دفع الرسوم الدراسية.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5273.365s">[David Murphy]</a>: إذا كنت تعيش على بعد أكثر من ميلين من المدرسة أو خارجها، فأنت تعلم أن شخصًا ما بدأ في الحصول على الحافلة الصفراء المجانية وتم إخبار شخص آخر أنه يتعين عليه دفع 30 دولارًا شهريًا مقابل عبور MBTA.
 هذا مثير للاشمئزاز.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5288.911s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: أبيض</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5289.571s">[David Murphy]</a>: إذا كانت هذه هي المشكلة التي نحاول حلها، فأعتقد أن هذه طريقة معقولة للقيام بذلك.
 وهذا ما يمكننا ملاحظته.
 ينص القانون بوضوح على أنه لا يُسمح لأي شخص يزيد عمره عن ست سنوات بقيادة السيارة.
 ولهذا السبب يوجد قانون لفرض قواعد الميلين الحالية، والتي تكون متسقة في جميع أنحاء البلاد.
 إنه أمر منطقي ويمكننا أن نفعل ذلك.
 ومع ذلك، فإن إجابتك تخبرني أننا جميعًا متفقون على معنى عدم المساواة وأنه شيء نريد معالجته.
 ولتحقيق هذا الهدف، سوف نقوم بوضع خطة التصويت.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5326.754s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: يمكنني التعليق على هذه المعلومة لأنني لست متأكدا ما إذا كنا نناقشها بشكل واضح أم لا، على الأقل هذا ما أشعر به وأريد توضيحه.
 كم عدد الحالات الحقيقية؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5336.458s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: فكرة النائب ماكلولين واضحة.</p>

 أعتقد أن مشكلتي الخاصة هي أن الطلاب الذين يعانون من صعوبات مالية عليهم أن يدفعوا
 النقل إلى المدرسة.
 لذا سواء كان ذلك على بعد ميلين أو ميلين أو ميل واحد أو أيًا كان ما نقترحه.
 أعلم أنه في الماضي دفع المعلمون تكاليف تسجيل طلابهم في MBTA.
 جواز سفر.
 لذا، تعتقد مورفي أنه قد يحتاج إلى مزيد من الاهتمام، وليس بالضرورة بناءً على حركات محددة، أو أن إضافة هذه الحركة ستسمح لـ MBTA بالمرور عبر الفصول الدراسية في المدينة، وقد يُسمح لهم بالحصول على فرص عمل.
 قد يُسمح بالنقل إلى المدرسة.
 بعض الأجزاء الأكثر أهمية التي تهمني هي: هل تطرح أسئلة؟
 هذا صحيح.
 فهل نركز بهذا المعنى على الصعوبات الاقتصادية؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5405.854s">[David Murphy]</a>: أوه، أعتقد أن هذا الالتماس... أعتقد أنه للجميع.
 نعم، أعتقد ذلك.
 نعم، إنها أوسع من مجرد الصعوبات الاقتصادية، ولكنها لا تغطي الطلاب داخل دائرة نصف قطرها ميلين.
 وهذا يعطينا نقطة بيانات مشابهة لما يتحدث عنه الدكتور جريشام حول استخدام نظام تحديد المواقع العالمي (GPS) لتحديد منظور البيانات الرسومية لدينا ونحتاج إلى التأكد من ذهابهم إلى المدرسة مجانًا.
 تمامًا كما كان الحال قبل عيد العمال، بمجرد وضع الحافلة في القاعة الرئيسية، تمكنا من استيعاب أكبر عدد ممكن من الطلاب.
 إذا استطعنا، أعتقد أن هذا سيكون أسهل دليل يمكن اتباعه.
 إذا نظرنا إلى هذا وقلنا حسنًا، فإن الحافلات التي نسيرها قبل العطلة تخدم 15% فقط من طلابنا.
 لخدمة مناطق مختلفة من المدينة نحتاج إلى 6 حافلات جديدة.
 لذا ربما نعود ونقول إننا بحاجة إلى إعادة البناء بشكل مختلف لأنه ليس لدينا طريقة مستدامة للقيام بذلك في الوقت الحالي.
 لذا قد يتعين علينا الآن خفض التكاليف، ونحن نستهدف أولئك الذين يعانون من صعوبات اقتصادية، كما قال إيكروفلين.
 مرة أخرى، لا أعرف بالضبط ما ستكون عليه النتيجة، ولكن أعتقد أن لدينا اتجاهًا واضحًا ونحن متحمسون للمضي قدمًا.</p>

 ثم كان تعليقي الأخير ببساطة أنني أكره إضاعة المال.
 سيستمر تمويل مشروع ترميم أو حمام كارولين لون حتى يتم وضع خطة رئيسية تعالج حقًا احتياجات المدرسة الثانوية على المدى الطويل.
 هذا كثير من المال.
 المبلغ الإجمالي حوالي ربع مليون دولار، وهو مبلغ كبير جدًا إذا تحدثنا
 مثل 10 عمال في مجال الطاقة، لا يمكننا الوصول إلى العديد من المعلمين في الميزانية.
 وبصرف النظر عن التكاليف دون خطة بناء واضحة، هناك العديد من الأولويات الأخرى.
 لقد قلت هذا من قبل، ولكن من المهم أن يكون لديك خطة واضحة للأرضية.
 لم أتمكن حتى الآن من دعم التمويل المجتمعي من النوع الذي يأتي معنا أو يأتي معنا لتلبية احتياجات البناء للمباني الكبيرة التي لم يتم تقييمها بعد.

 لذلك أعتقد أن هناك الكثير منهم.
 تتطلب المدرسة الثانوية الكثير من التركيز والرؤية من اللجنة، والعمل الذي نقوم به سيستغرق سنوات.
 لذلك أريد أن أقول إنني لا أوافق على ذلك.
 أريد أن أؤكد هذا.

 لدي بعض الأسئلة.
 أعتقد أنني سأبدأ بهذا الموضوع لأنه الأخير.
 أعتقد أنني أريد أن تكون لجنة رؤية MHS على جدول الأعمال التالي حتى نعرف ما يفكرون فيه عندما نفكر في إنفاق الأموال.
 لا أريد أن أنفق أموالاً جيدة بعد واحدة سيئة.
 لقد كان هناك الكثير من النقاش حول المدرسة الثانوية، لكن مازلنا لا نملك لجنة رؤية.
 وآمل أن يتم إدراج هذا الموضوع في جدول الأعمال المقبل.
 إذن، وبالعودة إلى موضوع الإمدادات، هل يقترح رئيس مجلس الإدارة أن يربط مورفي قدرات البرنامج باستحواذه؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5840.763s">[David Murphy]</a>: أحد هذه الملفات؟
 احصل على مزيد من المعلومات الأساسية.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5847.308s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: لا أعلم، لا أفهم ما الذي تتحدث عنه.
 أنت تتحدث عن التوصيل وأتمنى لو أنني أقلتك.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5854.951s">[David Murphy]</a>: آسف، أعتقد أن الأمر يتعلق باجتياز اختبار MBTA.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5858.012s">[David Murphy]</a>: قلت: أعتقد أنك على نفس رأي أمي.
 يقول ماكرولين إن تصريح MBTA يعد استثمارًا رائعًا للطلاب في المدرسة.
 إذا كان شراء بطاقة MBTA Pass له علاقة بالأمر، فهو استثمار رائع.
 البرامج والتدريس. فرص لإشراك الطلاب في المجتمع وتوفير فرص التعلم العملي.
 لا أعرف بعد، هناك العديد من المعلمين الذين لديهم CCR، CCSR هو المثال الأول، ولكن هناك العديد من الفرص للتدريس على مستوى المدرسة الثانوية، والحصول على التعليم في المجتمع وفي عالم التعليم بشكل عام خارج الفصول الدراسية العامة.
 وإذا أردنا زيادة الاستثمار
 والاستثمار في MBTA Pass، في رأيي، إذا فعلنا ذلك وفكرنا في تدريسنا، أعتقد أن هذا في حد ذاته أمر جيد على الأقل، ولكنه يحتوي أيضًا على هذا المورد حتى يتمكنوا من الوصول إلى الطلاب.</p>

 أعتقد أن هذا ما تريد قوله وما تريد التأكيد عليه لأنني أعتقد أن هذا العمل يشمل طلابًا محترفين ومتطوعين في CCSR وكل ذلك.
 لذلك من المثير للاهتمام أن نرى ما هي إمكانيات البرنامج عندما نفكر في تحليل تكلفة الخيارات المختلفة.
 أعلم أنه ليس لدينا حافلات متخصصة فحسب، بل لدينا أيضًا شركات نقل.
 لدينا العديد من مقدمي خدمات التوصيل وهناك بعض المشاكل بينهم.
 شخصيًا، لدينا بعض المشكلات مع مقدمي خدمات التوصيل لدينا وأعلم أنه من الصعب الاحتفاظ بالموظفين أو الاحتفاظ بهم.
 خاصة في الوضع الحالي.
 لكنني أتساءل عما إذا كانت هناك فرصة متوسطة أو تقريبًا مثل حل C-Clash؟
 ما يقدمه البائعون غير متناسق حتى في بعض الصفقات التي رأيتها.
 هل من الطبيعي أن يعود والديك إلى المنزل برسالة تفيد بأنك إذا فاتتك الحافلة في الصباح، فلن يصطحبوك في فترة ما بعد الظهر؟
 لا يمكنك.
 لكنها وسيلة للتعليم الخاص.
 ولكن هذه هي بالضبط الخريطة التي نراها.
 هذا ما أتحدث عنه.
 يجب أن يكون هناك اتساق في العقد والميزانية وجودة المطالبات.
 لماذا هذا صحيح؟
 تسمع إحدى الإدارات شكاوى حول قسم ما ويسمع مدير آخر شكاوى حول قسم آخر، وبالتالي فإن القضية الرئيسية هي ما إذا كانت لجنة المدرسة تفهم ما هو معقول.</p>

 أيها العمدة، اسمحوا لي أن أكون واضحًا: عميد خدمات الطلاب متحمس، لكنني قوي أيضًا.
 أفكر في الأشخاص الذين لم يفعلوا ذلك، وكيف تعاملوا مع الأمر وكيف أظهروا نجاح وسائل النقل.
 بصراحة، أعتقد أن الأمر يتعلق بجمع البيانات.
 هناك أيضًا أشياء مثل ذهاب الأطفال إلى المدرسة متأخرًا.
 لكن مرة أخرى، أعتقد أننا بحاجة إلى التركيز على موردينا.
 وأخيرا، أود أن أشكر المشرفة على قيادتها في تحقيق أهداف التطوير المهني والتطوير الوظيفي في مجال التحيز في الممارسة وأبحاث العلوم الاجتماعية.
 هناك عنوانان رئيسيان سمعتهما من الموظفين وأعضاء المجتمع حول التطوير المهني وأود تسليط الضوء عليهما.
 واحد منهم
 أعتقد أن بعض الموظفين المحترفين لا يشعرون بالضرورة أنهم يطورون مهارات معينة، كما تعلمون، تراخيص أو متطلبات محددة، لذلك أريد أن أتناول ذلك.
 كما تعلمون، مجرد الاهتمام بمشاركتكم وتطويركم المهني، وهو أمر مهم جدًا للتدريس، هو في الواقع جزء من التدريس، لكنني أعتقد أن الكثير من الناس فقدوا معلمين.
 هؤلاء هم الأساتذة ذوي العلاقات الجيدة. بقدر ما أعرف، كما تعلمون.
 لكنني أعتقد أنه من الرائع أيضًا أن نكون قادرين على منح الأشخاص المرونة والاختيار الوظيفي.
 لذلك، هذا ليس شيئًا أبحث عنه الليلة، لكني أريد فقط أن أتحدث عنه حتى تعرفوا.

 ប៉ុន្តែនេះគឺជាគោលនយោបាយជាក់លាក់មួយដែលជះឥទ្ធិពលដល់ការវាស់។
 ទេខ្ញុំមានន័យថាអត់ទេខ្ញុំមិនបានស្នើសុំរបាយការណ៍ទេប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំដឹងពីបទពិសោធន៍នេះពិតជាត្រឹមត្រូវមែន។

 ខ្ញុំប្រាកដថាកុមារជាច្រើននឹងតូចចិត្តប្រសិនបើពួកគេខកខានឡានក្រុង។
 ប៉ុន្តែមិនមានឡានក្រុងសម្រាប់កុមារទាំងអស់នៅក្នុងកាំពីរម៉ាយលនោះទេ។
 ដូច្នេះនៅពេលដែលយើងមានភ្លៀងធ្លាក់ខ្លាំងមានភ្លៀងធ្លាក់ដ៏គួរឱ្យភ័យខ្លាចដែលយើងធ្លាប់ទទួលបានមុនពេលឡើងកំដៅផែនដីរុញសីតុណ្ហភាពចូលដល់ទសវត្សទី 70, ប្រសិនបើអ្នកជិះឡានក្រុង,

 حسنًا، فيما يتعلق بالسفر الذي قمنا به الليلة، هل قدم لنا مورفي تقريرًا يوضح التكاليف المختلفة، مثل هل سنستخدم الحافلات الصفراء لجميع الطلاب أم سنشتري بطاقات عبور MBTA لجميع الطلاب؟
 هل يمكن تحليل هذا الاقتراح حسب وقت الميزانية لمعرفة مدى ملاءمته للميزانية؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6595.799s">[David Murphy]</a>: أعتقد أننا سنحاول التوصل إلى خطة تلغي خيار شراء بطاقة MBTA للطلاب الموجودين على بعد ميلين من المدرسة الثانوية.
 كيف نقضي هذا الوقت، أعتقد أننا سنستغرق بعض الوقت لمعرفة ذلك، لكن لا ينبغي لي أن أقول ذلك، ولكن أود أن أقول إنها يجب أن تكون خطة حيث نقوم بزيادة سعة الحافلة الصفراء.
 لدينا عدد X من تصاريح MBTA وتغطي المنطقة التعليمية تكاليف أولئك الذين ينجحون ويمكنهم التنقل.
 تساعد الجمعيات الأخرى في دفع السعر الكامل ومعرفة البيانات التي يمكننا جمعها لتحديد أساس مشتريات طلاب MBTA.
 لذا أعتقد نعم، علينا أن ننظر إلى كل مقياس.
 أعتقد أنني كنت سأفهم لو عرفنا قبل الأول من أغسطس
 وسنبلغ اللجنة بأن هذا ليس شيئًا يمكننا القيام به سواء من الناحية المالية أو الإدارية.
 أعتقد أنني أبلغت اللجنة بدلاً من مجرد التقيؤ والاعتذار عن عدم قدرتنا على القيام بذلك.
 أعتقد أن كل ما يمكننا قوله هو أنك تعرف قبلنا
 كل هذا يمنع الطلاب من شراء التذاكر بكميات كبيرة.
 حتى الآن بالنسبة لـ MME.
 ماكلولين، إذن يمكننا التفكير في كيفية استهداف الطلاب المحرومين اقتصاديًا.
 لذلك أعتقد أن هناك بعض التحديات، ولكن كما قلت، الاتجاه واضح وعلينا أن نتحرك في هذا الاتجاه وسنبذل كل ما في وسعنا لتحقيق ذلك.</p>

 أول اتصالات مع الطيور الوبائية مباشرة بعد الانتخابات وسط مخاوف بشأن تشكيلة المفوضية.
 علينا أن نقرر أين نريد أن نذهب.
 هل سننتخب لجنة جديدة؟
 أظهر شخص ما الاهتمام.
 الآن نحن بحاجة إلى تشكيل لجنة لأنني أتفهم مخاوف جيني.
 أريد أيضًا التأكد من أن المبنى صديق للأطفال.
 لذلك أعتقد أن هناك واحدة
 أعتقد أن هناك وسيلة جيدة بين عدم القيام بأي شيء وإجراء بعض التحسينات اللازمة للحفاظ على المبنى في حالة جيدة.
 يستخدم هذا النموذج من قبل الطالب.
 لكن الأهم هو أن نحدد تشكيل لجنة الرؤية وما نحتاج إليه والإطار الزمني الذي نفكر فيه.
 ربما نهاية يونيو ليست الوقت المناسب للبدء.
 أرى
 ولكن يجب أن نكون مستعدين للتركيز في أوائل سبتمبر بدلاً من الانتظار حتى مرور عام دراسي آخر.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6835.327s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: وبالمثل، فلنبدأ في الخريف ولدينا أشياء أخرى للقيام بها: ميزانية مدرسة كولومبوس، وقد عاد الأطفال.</p>

 أريد فقط
 أعني أنني أؤيد بشدة تجديد بعض الحمامات في الحرم الجامعي لأنها بحاجة إلى التجديد والتحديث.
 أوافق على أننا بحاجة إلى خطة أكثر تفصيلاً، ولكن الحمام الأكثر حداثة في المبنى بأكمله يقع في المنطقة العلمية.
 هذا للمجمع بأكمله مع حمام حديث حقيقي.
 لذلك ليس كل الطلاب يدرسون في هذا المجال.
 لذلك آمل أن يتم تخصيص بعض الأموال في عام 2019، ونظرًا لكل التقلبات والثورات، سيتم تحسين بعض الإصلاحات على الأقل.
 آمين لبعض هذه الحمامات.
 أعتقد أن هذا مهم جدًا.
 وكما تعلمون، لقد فكرت للتو في احتياجات الطلاب وقلت إنني أريد أن يكون لديهم حمام حديث.
 لذلك أريد فقط أن أذكر اللجنة بأننا كنا ملتزمين عندما تلقينا هذه الأموال.</p>

 ដូច្នេះប្រសិនបើយើងមានសំណាងហើយសិស្សថ្នាក់ទី 1 និងសាលាមត្តេយ្យអាចមានឱកាសធ្វើអ្វីដែលប្លែកប៉ុន្តែប្រសិនបើយើងចាត់វិធានការ។
 ដូច្នេះនោះជាពួកយើង។
