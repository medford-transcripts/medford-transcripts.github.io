    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=208.272s">[David Murphy]</a>:  Thank you, Superintendent, Mayor, members of the school committee.
 It's a pleasure to be with you again this evening.
 for our fifth committee of the whole meeting focused on the FY22 budget.
 As the superintendent mentioned, tonight we'll be focused on elements of the central office, specifically the offices that are under both the superintendent and my own supervision.
 As we go through the beginning of the program, as we have each time, we'll be looking at the org chart and talking specifically about the offices whose budgets are
 are here in light of the fact that these are the offices that myself and the superintendent work most closely with.
 While Dr. Kuching, Ms.
 Galussi, Ms.
 Bowen are here, with the exception of Director McLaughlin, we will be really the only presenters and speakers tonight.
 But certainly we'll be eager to answer any questions that you have, both with respect to the offices that we are focusing on tonight and anything else that we've covered
 over the course of the last several weeks.
 And as I mentioned in my message to the committee, both last night and a few minutes ago, we will be having a budget update on the school committee agenda this coming Monday, May 24th.
 And we'll certainly be picking up questions and comments at that point, incorporating and taking in your feedback.
 And that will go into the development of the recommendations that come before you.
 prior to your June 1st statutory hearing.
 So with that, I will start, as we always do, with the timeline for our budget process, beginning with the development of the district's strategic goals and priorities, leading to a series of, some administrators might say, seemingly endless administrative meetings internally, in which we vet various proposals and comments, questions, and suggestions
 principles and evening, but have not been following along for each of the various budget presentations, both at regular school committee meetings, budget subcommittee and the committee of the whole meetings.
 This is where we are right now leading up to that June 1st public hearing in which members of the community will be invited to speak either for or against, or a favorite for those who follow municipal presentations, those wishing to speak neither for nor against.
 the budget in part or in whole.
 And again, that will take place on June 1st, but there will be a budget update on Monday, an opportunity to comment and engage in further discussion.
 We've used the org chart in each of these presentations, just as by way of showing folks, perhaps outside of the Medford Public Schools community,
 which area of the organization we're focused on in this particular meeting.
 So this is the overall org chart showing all the various offices and departments reporting up to the superintendent.
 And then these are the areas that we'll be discussing tonight.
 So you can see it's primarily the areas in my own portfolio, as well as those reporting directly to the superintendent.
 And you see the curvy arrow there on the right of the screen.
 which is indicating a reorganization of sorts that we'll be proposing as part of the FY22 budget, and that's something I'll be going into greater detail about shortly.
 So as we've discussed in each of the budget presentations, the funding for the Metro Public Schools and the funding generally for school districts across Massachusetts comes from various sources.
 What we often refer to as the Chapter 70 allocation, which is the
 The state contribution under state law coming out of ed reform law of 1993 and the funding that each school community and district are entitled to.
 The local contribution, which is the revenue generated from at the local level that is air marked for the for the school department, which in Medford is a very sizable portion of that of the overall
 operating budget.
 And then the sort of extenuating circumstances under which we're currently operating mean we have a significant influx of federal funding coming in as a result of the COVID-related legislation that has come in.
 And that is coupled with the sort of standing external funds that come in on a year-in and year-out basis, particularly in the area of special education, which we discussed at length at the May 6th Committee of the Whole when we heard from the Office of Pupil Services.
 We've said that throughout the FY22 budget, we've asked those contributing to the development of this budget, meaning our department heads and our principals, to focus essentially on three primary buckets of areas in which we're asking them what are their budgetary priorities, what are their needs, what are their challenges.
 First is personnel and staffing.
 And the committee certainly said before that when we're talking about school budgets, we're almost always talking about people.
 We're an organization made up of people, educating people, hoping to make them better people and people who are positioned to do well in their post-secondary lives.
 But that is always going to be the largest chunk of our budget because, you know, as we say sometimes in school finance, we're not focused on widgets.
 We're focused on people in a community, and that's always going to be the largest chunk.
 Materials and infrastructure, particularly under the challenging conditions under which we're operating, are always going to represent
 another, albeit smaller, aspect of the budget.
 And training and professional development, which everything is, we are looking at everything through a post-COVID context, but for training and professional development, when we think about the ways in which some of the inequities, both within public education and society at large, have come into sharper relief as a result of the experience that we've all lived through, we are thinking very much in that context when we talk about
 what are our professional development and training priorities, and what is it that we're looking to invest in.
 And particularly when we're talking about the superintendent's priorities, while much of what we're planning will be supported by external funding, given that the budget development process is the opportunity to really look at the organization as a whole, see how we're structured, how we're organized, what it is that we're pursuing, what are our discrete challenges, what are our long-term overarching challenges,
 This really is an opportunity to sort of pull the veil back on all of the Medford Public Schools.
 And my hope would be that throughout these committee of the whole presentations, as we've heard from the various directors and school leaders, my hope would be that both for the school committee and the members of the community who are either watching this in real time or perhaps watching it subsequent to the presentations, you'll see the effort toward transparency that we have employed to try to demonstrate for the community exactly what it is that we're doing.
 And I hope also
 the rationale behind these priorities.
 And this slide talks a little bit about that rationale in that these are the questions that were posed that led to the development of these priorities and that we're thinking about what are the targeted and intensive interventions that we can invest in to help reduce or eliminate the learning or opportunity gaps that have either been caused by or exacerbated by the disruption to instruction that our students have faced as a result of
 the COVID-19 pandemic.
 And so there will come a time when our budgetary priorities and our goals are not informed fully by this experience and the disruption that our students have lived through.
 At least I certainly hope that's the case.
 One of the sort of constant refrains that we go back to is we're looking to make investments that will ensure our students' academic careers are not defined by this experience.
 And hopefully if we make these investments and we execute on them wisely, that will be the case.
 But for right now,
 coming out of these, as cliche as it might sound, these unprecedented circumstances, we are looking to see how do we use the funding that's available to us from the local, state, and federal levels to try to put them in the best position possible despite the chaos that we've all lived through.
 So on April 26th, we presented to the school committee the projections that we were looking at based on the preliminary information that we had.
 uh, leading into these budget presentations.
 And we've estimated that, uh, the necessary increase in the budget would be somewhere between 3.4 and $5.8 million.
 Recognizing that there are a significant number of variables that are, uh, essentially not clear while variable one, there are restrictions on federal funding flowing in that are still not particularly clear.
 And I appreciate the mayor's comments to that effect.
 last night, but we're continuing to engage in a very constructive dialogue with our partners in the city government and reaching out to our partners at the state level and elsewhere to try to get clarity on that.
 I think at this point we feel comfortable that the priorities we've developed that we think of as having a strong nexus to the disruption caused by COVID will be essentially eligible expenses.
 It's a question of, from an administrative perspective, exactly how
 we'll go about processing those and exactly how realistic is it to do that.
 So I think we feel good about the priorities that we've identified as our COVID-related or potential ESSER-related priorities, but there's still a lot of clarity that needs to come into view in the coming weeks.
 In addition to that, we know we have fixed costs as every district does on a year-on-year basis.
 These are costs that are related to contractual obligations or
 other situations that have essentially predated the development of this budget, but we know that they're going to lead to an increase in costs.
 Other variables also include the fact that we have upwards of nine collective bargaining agreements that are expiring either at the conclusion of this school year or the conclusion of the summer.
 And so that's certainly a factor that we have to take into account as we work through the development of this budget.
 This is just information related to those external funding, the numbers the committee has seen several times before, so I won't
 belabor it, but we estimate about a $7.6 million ESSER budget over the next several years.
 And so I wouldn't say that we necessarily see that as needing to be expended in equal installments over the three or four year period that we have.
 But I would say that we want to be mindful of the fact that we're going to have additional data that will hopefully point us to more strategic uses of the funding as time goes on.
 So it may be the case that some of the more immediate expenses are in the short term, but the better use of the funding could be in year two or year three.
 And for that reason, we are looking to be, I'm not sure I would use the word conservative, but certainly cautious and cognizant of the implications of using that funding.
 And the fact is, as you've heard me say several times, these are one-time funds and the ESSER funding will not last forever.
 And so we have to be mindful of the uses
 being taking care to not create unnecessary structural deficits, and at the same time, making sure that we're being responsive to the urgent needs of students.
 And so where we strike that equilibrium is a big part of the conversations that we have been having and that we will be having.
 So I'm going to pause for one second before we move on to buildings and grounds and just talk a little bit about what you'll see over the next couple of slides in this, but I'm glad that I flashed to it quickly so that I can tell
 Mr. McLaughlin that he's on next as I continue to babble for another minute or so.
 But the departments that you're seeing starting with buildings, we're going to start with buildings and grounds and then move to the more umbrella offices of the superintendent's office and the office of finance and operations.
 And if you think back to the organizational chart that we saw at the beginning of the presentation, you can see that for both myself and Dr. Edouard-Vincent, there are a lot of priorities and funding and strategic investments
 and proposals that cut across the different departments and offices that you've already heard from.
 And that's a good thing because what we don't want to do is present a budget to you in the form of 25 siloed or overly departmentalized mini organizations.
 We want common themes and common strategic priorities that cut across.
 And so what you'll see in the bullets that we've identified are pieces that are either reflective of those priorities
 or operational pieces that are meant to put us in a position that we'll be able to actually pursue those priorities and do so successfully.
 Similar to the information technology budget proposals that we discussed in last night's committee of the whole, a large portion, arguably all, frankly, of the buildings and grounds priorities, the year maintenance issue,
 uh, that is essentially routine.
 I think routine was the word that we used in the technology presentation.
 That's something that we typically are going to incorporate one way or another into our operating budget.
 Um, something that is a one-time expense and I'm using the term one time in the context of municipal budgeting.
 And so one time could mean every 10 years, every 15 years, every 20 years, but certainly not on an annual basis.
 Um, that's every 20 years, but certainly not on an annual basis.
 That's something that we're going to look up to as a capital expense that we're going to try to keep off the operating budget for purposes of not creating some of those deficits that we've talked about.
 What we do when we have a large influx of federal funding, frankly, similar to how we handled the funding that came in during FY21, and to some extent in FY20 as well, is to try to address some of the most urgent priorities and needs that might in another context be considered a capital expense.
 but in light of the urgency, we're looking to just take what funding is available and make sure that that's addressed.
 That was certainly the case as is reflected in the buildings and grounds budget narrative that was provided to you today with regard to our HVAC repairs that we needed to expedite and accelerate at the beginning of this school year for purposes of getting students and staff back into the physical school buildings.
 And so I expressed my appreciation for Mr. McLaughlin and members of his team who partnered with
 the external experts that we brought in to make that a reality.
 The history as to how we got to the place where so much work was necessary, I think, has been addressed at length in previous meetings.
 But however we got here, we are in a much better position from an air quality perspective because that work was done throughout the course of this year.
 And now we're looking at some of the other heavy infrastructure pieces that may not land in the operating budget for FY22.
 but are critical priorities that need to be addressed in the near term.
 And I'm going to ask Mr. McLaughlin, if he could, to walk us through some of these.
 As we're talking about how these investments need to be made in the coming year or months.
 So John, do you want to take it from there and just start maybe with the generator and transformer electrical issues that we have
 been identified at the high school and at the Andrews and then we'll walk through some of the other pieces.
 From there we'll move on to finance operations in the superintendent's office and then we'll go to questions after that.

 我不知道。
 我已经激活了接入点。
 我，我，你知道，我为此准备了一段时间。
 不管怎样，所以，呃，是的，所以，呃，断路器或放大器，呃，反式，呃，断路器在安德鲁斯高中被更​​换了。
 所以我们回到了我们需要去的地方。
 嗯，它是，呃，我们对所有电气系统进行，嗯，安全，呃，检查，红外扫描的一部分。
 在高中，通过法学院，对不起。
 因此，我们能够用正常的运营预算来解决这个问题。
 所以我们知道，我们也知道应急发电机，它正准备出去进行 RFP。
 此外，变压器是梅德福高中原装设备。
 所以发生的事情是，是在什么时候，
 几年前我会有多氯联苯。
 所以我们必须去掉 PCB 并在上面涂上另一种油。
 最终发生的情况是橡胶密封件容易脱落。
 所以我正在获取报价。
 我有，今天刚收到，检查变压器。
 并确保我们能够回到我们需要去的地方。
 它的油量很低，但仍在运行，但它肯定是应该优先考虑的事情，因为它还运行着大约三分之一的功率。
 在梅德福高中。
 然后我们将准备好定价信息以继续推进。
 显然，这将是一个带有发电机的夏季项目，只要我们准备好承担该项目即可。
 今年我们进行了一些安全改进。
 我们有一个新的 Raptor 系统。
 当时我安装了所有显示器，并接受了新 Raptor 系统的培训。
 如果你不知道猛禽系统是你进来的地方，你给自己一个许可证，他们会扫描它。
 如果一切顺利，您将收到一个标签，并准备好前往总办公室办理您在我们任何学校需要办理的业务。
 因此，我们希望每三四年完成一次停车场。
 我应该说，通常是整个系统范围内的所有这些。
 停车场又被标记了，它们开始老化了。
 我们想做一些
 梅福德高中的调整，我们将就残疾人停车情况与该学校会面。
 我知道我们在谈论主入口时进行了这样的对话。
 我认为我们想要做的是搬到梅福德高中前面的残疾人专用点，并进入那里的残疾人坡道。
 所以，你知道，让我们回顾一下。
 我和
 Lungo-Koehn 市长上周表示，如果我需要帮助，我们在市政厅有交通部门，他们会非常乐意帮助我们。
 几年前，我们与他们会面，试图做出一些改进，但众所周知，过去的一年并不是我们通常处理的典型年份。
 柯蒂斯塔夫茨锅炉项目，所以去年冬天，锅炉开始泄漏。
 这些都是我们可能会在下周的小组委员会会议上讨论的问题。
 这就是为什么我们订购了一些需要重新安装的部件，即分段部件。
 因此，我们得到了两个部分，他们将更换它们，这应该可以阻止我们预期的泄漏。
 我们将不得不在这方面花费大量资金。
 和暖通空调的改进。
 所以我们知道我们做了很多这样的事情。
 我们目前正在打开空调。
 因此，存在与此相关的问题，某些特定区域需要我们聘请承包商来修复。
 根据法律规定，我们必须在 5 月 15 日之前提供供暖。
 所以这周是我们进行结算的一周。
 不幸的是，本周很热，你知道，这很愚蠢，但这周很热。
 教室里的一些老师感到有点不舒服，但我们正在努力解决。
 我们知道你在那里。
 我们将尽快出去处理所有需要做的事情。
 致电承包商。
 我只是想列出一份我们需要做的事情以及需要做的建筑物的清单。
 嗯，浴室改造项目。
 戴夫和我会见了建筑师。
 嗯，我想我们只是在等待获得许可来查看并制作该项目的 RFP。
 是，我知道这是一个，嗯，
 梅福德高中项目对于改善浴室的许多人来说都是很亲近的。
 我们想要它，我知道。
 市长让我们看看我们能生产多少。
 我想如果我们能得到一个价格，我们就会知道我们在哪里，然后我们就可以从那里走得尽可能远。
 我们仍在等待主入口修复工程。
 看看我们要做什么。
 我们的一个在清洁办公室工作的人是一名瓦工，所以他主动提出出去尝试修复一点墙壁，花岗岩墙。
 所以今天他在那里工作。
 我的意思是，我希望我能让它看起来更好一点，但它仍然会
 什么，是什么，所以你知道我们当然可以在主入口见面，我想我们将在下周和小组委员会讨论并讨论我们希望如何推进这一点。
 这就是为什么我每年都会在预算范围内订购一辆带犁的卡车。
 所以这并没有改变。
 这肯定会对降雪有所帮助，也肯定会对整个地区的其他杂项项目有所帮助。
 如果我们有一辆带犁的卡车。
 所以，你知道，我可以多次帮助 DPW，因为他们行动非常迅速。
 而且，你知道，有时有些区域需要修补，但他们无法返回，因为主要目标是城市周围的道路。
 因此，拥有这样的东西肯定会有助于提高效率。
 由我们处置，接机。
 现在，我想，现在的剧院正在翻修，如果你看到我的预算前报告的话。
 如果我有一个希望看到成果的项目，那就是添加空调、栏杆、更新门以及在剧院进行一些电气工作。
 几年前我得到了一个价格，现在的价格不同了：在剧院的天花板上加装一台空调需要 10 万美元。
 我认为这对社区也有好处。
 也为学校创造收入，也许在某个时候将其添加到我们的资本改进清单中。
 但是，就像我说的，如果我可以选择我想做的高中项目，那将是我的主要项目之一，即改造项目。
 我们一直致力于学校的暖通空调改进项目。
 你知道，在某些时候，也许我们可以从 MSBA 获得帮助，也许我们可以添加空调以及梅福德高中目前没有空调的其他部分，这意味着科学实验室是建筑物中唯一有空调的真正部分。
 服务，你知道，除了我们到处都有的窗式空调。
 所以看不到底部。</p>

 Uh, men se pa sèlman, uh,
 Nenpòt kesyon yo akeyi, mèsi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=1823.649s">[David Murphy]</a>: Mèsi, John.
 Majistra, mwen sijere ke nou kontinye ak pwosesis soumèt nou an epi apre mwen menm, John, Dr Edwards, ak lòt moun pral kontan reponn nenpòt kesyon si sa itil ou.
 Sa ap travay pou mwen.
 Oke, mèsi.
 Se konsa, pandan n ap antre nan rès administrasyon santral la, biwo direktè a ak biwo pwòp mwen an,
 Nou te mansyone anvan ke gen plizyè depatman anba parapli sa yo.
 Bilding lan ak teren yo se san dout youn nan pi gwo a epi, franchman, youn nan pi frape.
 Se sètènman poukisa nou te envite Mesye McLaughlin vin aswè a epi diskite sou kèk nan detay yo.
 Ak byen vit deplase sou yon pwen final sou bidjè ki gen rapò ak amelyorasyon HVAC lekòl segondè.
 Franchman, sa a se yon gwo egzanp sou diferans ki genyen ant antretyen ak kapital.
 Lè nou ajou kèk nan filtè lekòl la pou amelyore kalite lè a, nou fè depans fiks adisyonèl ki asosye ak ranplasman filtè yo.
 Yon pati nan sèvi ak filtè pi bon kalite se ke nou te deplase soti nan ranplase sistèm nan chak de ane nan ranplase li chak trimès.
 Franchman, se pa yon pri enpòtan pou distri lekòl la, men se yon pri antretyen.
 Kontrèman ak chodyèr,
 Oswa yon dèlko transfòmatè, youn nan konpozan ke nou sètènman pa vle fè depans chak ane.
 Nou pral enkòpore sa nan bidjè nou ak planifikasyon kapital nan ane k ap vini yo.
 Donk, konsernan bidjè sipèentandan ak bidjè biwo finans ak operasyon yo, jan mwen te mansyone anvan, kèk nan sa yo mare ak kèk nan lòt priyorite yo ak kèk nan lòt bagay yo.
 Envestisman estratejik yo te rekòmande pou ou.
 Premyèman, konsènan bidjè sipèentandan an, mwen regrèt ou tande ke konsantre nou pandan tout pwosesis devlopman bidjè ane sa a se pou asire nou idantifye opòtinite devlopman pwofesyonèl ak fòmasyon pou anplwaye nou yo ki konsistan avèk bezwen distri a nan yon kontèks apre COVID.
 Oke, $75,000, li aktyèlman pwobableman yon ti kras mwens pase sa paske li pral gaye sou de oswa twa ane taks.
 Se konsa, li pral yon ti kras pi piti pase sa.
 Nou idantifye opòtinite devlopman pwofesyonèl ki pral entansif ak sansib pou anviwònman kote rejyon an pral kontinye opere nan ane k ap vini yo.
 Se konsa, nou gen espesifik devlopman sosyal ak emosyonèl pwofesyonèl.
 ak fòmasyon sou patipri implicite, ki pral kòmanse efektivman nan fen ane fiskal 2021 la epi answit ap dewoule nan ane fiskal ki vin apre yo, okòmansman ouvè pou anplwaye ak manadjè ki gen rapò ak dosye yo.
 Sa a pral yon pwogram obligatwa nan fen ete 2021.
 Kidonk, èske Dr Edward-Vincent oswa Dr Cushing ta vle pale yon ti kras plis sou benefis fòmasyon sa a ak fason nou panse sou li.
 Sa a konsistan avèk estrateji an jeneral ke nou te defann pandan tout pwosesis sa a.
 Yon pwen final.
 Mon ekspekte ki laplipar sa bann depans pou ganny finanse par serten finansman eksteryer ki nou’n mansyonnen o komansman prezantasyon.
 Se konsa, Tit II, espesyalman, ka tou fè pati finansman ESSER, men Tit II yo pral itilize espesyalman pou kouvri depans ki pral fèt nan ane fiskal 2021.

 Pou adrese kèk nan gwo chanjman nou pral fè nan ane k ap vini an, patikilyèman nan domèn aprantisaj sosyal-emosyonèl.
 Youn nan domèn komite lekòl la responsab se fason distri a jere sispansyon, ki tonbe anba konpòtman aprantisaj sosyal-emosyonèl, pami lòt bagay.
 Donk sa se definitivman yon priyorite enpòtan.
 Pou nou, sa a se youn nan domèn objektif pou devlopman pwofesyonèl.
 Anplis de sa, nou pral kontinye chèche konpreyansyon ak plis devlopman pwofesyonèl sou patipri implicite ak enpak li sou kominote lekòl yo.

 Oke, apre fòmasyon, yo ka deplwaye nan distri a epi fè devlopman pwofesyonèl nan distri a.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=2280.431s">[David Murphy]</a>: 谢谢你，博士。
 然后去财务和运营办公室。
 正如您所看到的，这里有一些不同点。
 我将重点关注三个方面，包括交通，我认为它有自己的幻灯片，而且确实如此，谢谢。
 但首先，前两个，这是在昨晚的演讲中提到的。
 我认为这是在英语学习部门确定的优先事项的背景下发生的。
 想要投资一个机会来发展我们的努力，主要是我们的家庭承诺和社区关系。
 我当时指出，我们没有确定 22 财年对 EL 部门的具体投资的部分原因是我们从该地区获得了一项投资，我们希望能够推动这一事业，我们将为此努力。
 与 EL 部门、卫生服务部门、特殊教育部门等密切合作。
 我认为，当我们考虑如何构建组织以及如何组织特定的工作组合时，作为一般规则，最佳实践是确定需求，确定正在满足的需求或由于其他变化变量而正在发展的需求，
 然后确定如何最好地开发适合组织结构的角色和组合，以促进这些目标。
 然而，有时会出现多种事件同时发生的情况，我们的领导人员具有可用的能力和不断出现且变得更加紧迫的需求。
 这种融合发生在整个学年。
 老实说，引起我们注意的方式之一是当我们需要将整个行政部门转移到学校担任代课教师时。
 当我们清楚地意识到这令人筋疲力尽且几乎不可能时，我们试图做出不同的修改，我们的课前和课后规划主任继续自愿承担这项工作，并继续与我们沟通，就像她一段时间以来所做的那样，她觉得
 他的投资组合中有空间容纳额外的责任和信心类型，以及我们作为经理和领导者所拥有的个人能力。
 事实上，我们能够度过本学年，但通过能够确定我们可以在父母和家庭参与领域改进和更好地工作的做法，
 我指望黛安·考德威尔（Diane Caldwell）的帮助，她是我们的前副总监，曾担任家长信息中心的高级主任。
 我要说的是，作为一个新来这个学区的人，我在第一周继承了家长信息中心作为我的投资组合的一部分，没有夫人。
 考德威尔，
 如果能够提供这种领导力、指导和机构知识，这将是更具挑战性的一年，不仅是在对 PIC 的监督方面，而且在我和其他高级管理人员负责的工作的几乎所有其他要素方面。
 但我们从一开始就知道，
 考德威尔担任家长信息中心的管理员并不是一个永久的解决方案，他试图在内部运作
 在我们的预算范围内，我们不一定打算为家长信息中心主任作为一个没有其他职责的单一职位提供资金。
 然后是夫人。
 Fidler 表达了承担额外责任的意愿和热情。
 我们认为家长信息中心与贫困学校和缺勤学校计划之间有着紧密的自然联系，以及额外的支持
 呃，我们需要的能力，嗯，我们需要在家庭关系、交通方面的能力。
 嗯，我们认为这适合作为一个合法的、全面的管理组合。
 因此，作为 22 财年预算的一部分，我们建议将这些办公室重组为一般家庭参与区域，其中包括对家长信息中心的监督、对课前和课后计划的持续监督。
 以及交通连接等服务。
 现在，坦率地说，所有这些角色组合在一起的原因之一是它们是学年的不同部分，需要更大程度的关注和细节。
 这就是为什么我说这是一种融合，因为它非常适合与已经具备机构知识的人一起创建一个完整的 12 个月的角色。
 并在过去为该地区做出了出色的工作。
 这就是为什么能够有效地做到这一点，同时也对如何更有效地推进学区围绕家庭和社区伙伴关系的目标充满信心，是制定该提案的一部分。
 所以这是一场戏。
 然后你会看到，正如昨晚也提到的，
 我们设立了赠款协调员职位。
 这本身是一个非预算的事情，它不一定会对运营预算和赠款产生影响，这个人基本上一直担任非官方赠款协调员一段时间，但从技术上讲，在行政助理的角色中，我们已经能够将该人调到财务和运营办公室，与米歇尔·金登和她的团队合作，以确保我们
 履行我们的所有义务并尽可能有效地从合规角度执行。
 这是不同的，我想强调这一点。
 这当然与我们目前没有的拨款写作角色不同，但我们正在探索其他方法来释放一些能力，让管理员有机会更好地培养外部合作伙伴关系和
 并寻找赠款机会，以便我们的赠款协调员能够帮助协调并尝试以这种方式释放额外的预算能力。
 在我们谈论交通之前，我想再说一遍，这是我们昨晚谈话的延续。
 在本学年中，我们继续与 Management Solution 和 Paquette 先生保持合作关系，Paquette 先生担任临时代理
 夫人之间的业务管理员
 帕特森和我。
 我们已准备好委托提交给学校委员会的报告。
 基本上，我要求对报告进行附录，因为该报告是在整个学年中准备的，并在某种程度上促进了预算制定过程。
 我问帕克特先生，根据我们仍然拥有的预付款，
 基本上，您可以填写一些补充内容，其中会考虑到我们所做的一些更改，夫人。
 Kimu 和我在过去的几个月里将这一点付诸实践。
 这就是为什么我预计在本财年结束之前将其提交给委员会。
 然后，帕克特先生，我们与塔夫茨大学的合作伙伴关系，一开始只是测试合作伙伴关系，后来发展为对话。
 在技​​术基础设施的背景下，我希望我们整个夏天都能非常有效地从中受益。
 但随后我们还将探讨在展望 2022 财年时我们应该保留或可能参考的其他外部知识。
 这是一个高层次的概述。
 我将结束交通，然后继续回答您的问题。
 如果您还记得当我们谈论 22 财年的预测时，我们的成本增加了约 51,000。
 我必须快速地说，这些是因为它们是在 5 月 6 日解决的。
 这些与我们与特殊教育相关的固定交通成本无关。
 这是我们的主要供应商东方巴士。
 学校委员会于 2020 年春季签订了一份为期三年的新合同。
 所以，我们正在完成其中的第一个。
 的三年合同。
 与合同一样，成本逐年增加。
 因此，我们预计该合同将增加约 51,000 美元，作为我们预计固定成本增加 210 万美元的一部分。
 4 月 26 日，当提出有关 MBTA 通行证的请求时，您已经看到了以下两个数字。
 这本质上是我们的一个选择
 确保委员会知道。
 然后还有一些问题，涉及额外黄色巴士的基本成本以及在高中提供额外东区巴士容量的可能性。
 我们估计约为 75,000 美元。
 我之所以说它是零到 75,000 美元，是因为在我们与供应商的对话中，他们有，
 我认为，并且我很欣赏这一点，我不知道是否所有提供商都会这样做，但他们建议，根据本学年之前该学区采用的半径，就初中和高中交通而言，有可能重新调整我们现有的一些能力，以提供至少一辆额外的巴士到高中。
 下周我们将与
 巴士提供商以及梅德福警察局，我们将在那里讨论一系列问题，既与安全有关，也与规划即将到来的夏季学年的路线和站点的开发有关。
 所以，坦率地说，我目前没有向委员会提出关于是否应该增加第二辆公共汽车的任何建议。
 我认为很明显我们可以做到这一点。
 所以我认为问题在于查看有关哪里的数据
 什么是高中生以及是否有需求。
 我要说的是，在我与中等教育管理部门的简短对话中，我们根本不清楚是否知道对此有明确的需求，但我认为我们要牢记这一点。
 但与此同时，如果为学生提供更方便的服务的成本在 0 到 75,000 美元之间，那么显然我们会考虑这一点。
 我认为从战略角度来看，我们需要牢记 MBTA 通行证显然有可能提供更多的准入机会。
 而且，你知道，你开始考虑学生工作、去城市的机会。
 城市还有其他类型的体验，例如 MBTA 通行证可以为学生提供的课堂和体验式学习体验。
 我们正在考虑所有这些选择。
 贯穿所有演示的一个共同点是，我们决心在 21-22 学年为学生建立有效的延长上课日和课外活动计划，利用 ESSER 资金确保我们在学生面临重大干扰后提供尽可能最大的恢复支持。
 因此，我感谢您抽出时间并在这方面给予我宽容。
 如果你喜欢我可以提供更多证词和证人的演示，我保证我也更喜欢它们。
 但这些是建筑物和土地、财务和运营办公室以及主管办公室的记录。
 此时，我将很乐意回答您的问题。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3062.978s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Mèsi mesye.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3068.903s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Mèsi.
 Finalman mwen pral ale nan transpò otobis lekòl la.
 Dave, ou te ban nou kèk opsyon enteresan, men ak diferans pri gwo.
 Nan pwen sa a, lè ou kreye bidjè sa a,
 Kiyès ou ye epi ou rekòmande nou?
 Vini non, mwen vle di, ki jan nou mete depans nan yon bidjè?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3100.169s">[David Murphy]</a>: Oke, mwen panse premye a, wi, premye desizyon an se si komite a konfòtab ak reyon ki te adopte ane pase a kont reyon yon mil pou tout klas eksepte jadendanfan.
 Donk si sa a se yon bagay komite a vle kenbe
 Se konsa, vandè a ap fondamantalman di pral gen kapasite depase nan youn nan lekòl elemantè yo.
 Kidonk, kontra Eastern Bus ki egziste deja, ki vo anviwon $1.4 milyon, pral ba nou yon otobis lekòl adisyonèl, mwen panse ke nou ta dwe konsidere itilize nan lekòl segondè a pou ogmante kapasite.
 Sèl kesyon mwen an se
 Si nou pa fè sa, nou ka redireksyon li nan pwogram apre lekòl ak jou lekòl pwolonje san nou pa fè yon potansyèl $100,000 nan depans adisyonèl.
 Oswa omwen gen yon pri pou peye.
 Kidonk, mwen panse premye desizyon an se si konsèy la kontan ak yon reyon yon mil, ki machann yo di pa pral gen yon gwo enpak sou pye.
 Fondamantalman sa a se kote nou ye kounye a.
 Si sa a se ka a
 Se konsa, mwen panse pwochen etap la se gade done ki gen rapò ak kote elèv lekòl segondè ap viv ak si gen yon chemen ki gen sans pou konprann kote elèv yo ye.
 Ankò, mwen panse ke sèl dezavantaj nan pwogram sa a se ke ak apwobasyon MBTA, yo pa jis mennen ou nan lekòl la.
 Mwen panse ke, espesyalman pou elèv lekòl segondè nou yo, gen yon tòn opòtinite aprantisaj eksperyans ke pasaj MBTA ka pote pou yo.
 Dènye bagay mwen vle di se ke si nou mare opòtinite pwogram nan ak akizisyon li yo, siy MBTA a vin yon pi bon envestisman.
 Mwen panse ke li ka pran kèk tan, petèt ete a ase, pou bay lidè ansèyman nou yo tan pou devlope kalite opòtinite sa yo pou maksimize enpak potansyèl envestisman sa a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3230.138s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Donk, Dave, ann tounen sou youn nan bagay ou te di sou reyon yon mil la.
 Mwen dwe di, mwen pa sonje vote.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3239.024s">[David Murphy]</a>: Se konsa... sa a te anvan lè m ', men konpreyansyon mwen se ke lè plan reouvèti sa a te vini nan komite lekòl la kolektivman kòm yon kalite gwo, plan milti-aspè, difizyon te yon pati nan li.
 Kòm yon rezilta, wout ak arè yo te ajiste.
 Mwen panse tou, e mwen jis rive konnen sa a,
 Se paske kantite pasaje yo desann anpil ane sa a, nòmalman ou ta retire estasyon otobis yo epi tande yon vag fidbak, men sa pa t rive ane sa a.
 Li posib tou ke kantite pasaje yo te tonbe siyifikativman akòz epidemi an.
 Si sa a pa pote sou nan ane pwochèn, Lè sa a, ou ta vle konsidere sa a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3280.253s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Wi, mwen panse ke li konplètman konprann ke nimewo pasaje nou yo te desann anpil.
 Mwen konnen nan Medford gen kèk elèv ki pran otobis akòz enkyetid sou wout ak sekirite trafik kote y ap viv.
 Se konsa, otomatik la di li se yon mil, byen, li pa janm te yon mil sou otomatik la.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3307.655s">[David Murphy]</a>: Sa ki enpòtan se, mwen eskize pou sa,
 Si ou panse sa a se evidan, zèklè pa gen anyen fè ak sove sekirite.
 Estasyon otobis ou a se yon pati nan konvèsasyon nou an semèn pwochèn.
 Se poutèt sa te gen reprezantan pa sèlman nan rejyon an ak vandè a, men tou nan Polis la Metwopoliten.
 Paske lè nou revize ak analize wout ak sit, nou vle asire ke nenpòt sit ki soulve enkyetid yo ak anpil atansyon pa ekspè sekirite piblik, epi
 Pa gen okenn dout ke egzanpsyon sekirite yo pran priyorite sou nenpòt lòt politik konsènan difizyon.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3344.167s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Yeah, byen, kèk nan li se, ou konnen, pèsepsyon sekirite, oswa li te alantou pou yon tan long ak nenpòt mouvman retire li ta definitivman lakòz yon dezòd.
 Li son trè optimis pou mwen tande ou di ke nou pral gen kèk espas epi yo pral kapab itilize otobis ki egziste deja.
 Dave, sa sanble trè optimis pou mwen, e mwen se yon optimis an jeneral, men mwen pa pare pou balanse de la.
 Wi, gen 350 nan tèt la, ki se yon gwo chanjman.
 E i annan serten, mon anvi dir, akoz i annan bokou, i difisil pour konpran egzakteman sa ki nou pe met dan nou bidze.</p>

 Pou nou klè, done sa yo reponn kesyon komite a.
 Non, mwen pa konnen, e mwen sètènman pa gen yon sijesyon sou kote 350,000 moun sa yo soti.
 Se konsa, di verite a.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3487.681s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: Oke, mèsi.
 Se jis, ou konnen, li sanble ke sonje bagay anvan pandemi se pafwa vrèman difisil, men, ou konnen, memwa mwen se tankou, ou konnen,
 Finansman transpò nou an poko alokasyon ekitab nan diferan kalite gwoup, kidonk mwen pral jis kenbe li senp.
 Nou te tèlman jenere ak finansman transpò ki gen rapò ak espò ke manm gwoup yo te oblije vann tout sa yo posede pou jwenn ase lajan pou peye pou transpò otobis.
 Sa a se katriyèm bidjè mwen an.
 Sa gen kat ane, mwen pa te sèl moun ki te di sa
 Nou bezwen enfòmasyon detaye sou konbyen lajan chak elèv depanse nan aktivite ki pa nan kourikoulòm.
 Paske mwen fè zantray mwen konfyans, mwen pa gen timoun pou fè egzèsis ak.
 Mwen gen timoun nan bann.
 Mwen pa enterese fè gwo deklarasyon oswa rekòmande chanjman politik san okenn done.
 Men, santiman mwen, lè mwen wè sak jimnastik la,
 Genyen evidamman kèk kalite diferans ant antrenè kont jesyon bann ak lòt konpansasyon sou kontra nou an ki ta ka apwopriye ki baze sou kantite èdtan yo mete nan, men mwen pa gen okenn fason pou konnen.
 Alor mon vreman mazinen si nou pa pe favorize bann zanfan ki deside fer sport e ki’n pran fado lo zot fanmir pour rasanble larzan transpor.
 Mwen jis itilize de egzanp sa yo konpare ak timoun nan gwoup.
 Mwen sèten gen lòt.
 Se konsa, retabli se evidamman pi bon pase pa retabli, men mwen pa gen okenn fason pou konnen si sa a vrèman jis.
 Sa enpòtan anpil pou mwen.
 Sa a se katriyèm bidjè ki gen pwoblèm sa a.
 Katriyèm ane mwen te vle li, mwen reyalize ou pa nan bidjè a pou twa dènye yo.
 Kidonk, ou konnen, konbyen lajan nou depanse sou yon baz pou chak elèv?
 Mwen vle di, sa enkli bous nan kontra pwofesè yo.
 Mwen vle di, tout lajan nou depanse nan edikasyon, kontrèman ak klas matènèl jiska uityèm ane, kisa nou depanse li?
 Kote li prale?
 Èske sa vrèman jis?
 Mwen vle di, paske mwen konnen espò yo tèlman enpòtan pou anpil moun,
 Entèdiksyon sa a trè enpòtan pou anpil moun.
 Mwen vrèman panse ke nou dwe rive nan fon sa a.
 Mwen pa panse se yon bagay nou ka rezoud aswè a.
 Pou m sipriz, mwen pa vrèman konnen si pwoblèm sa a ap rezoud.
 Men, sètènman mwen remake ke ou pa te nan twa dènye bidjè yo.
 Wi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3661.661s">[David Murphy]</a>: Non, sa se yon bon kesyon.
 Mwen panse ou gen rezon.
 Mwen vle di, pafwa gen diferan degre nan frè.
 Mwen panse ke pi fò nan tan an,
 Diferans sa a lakòz atravè rejyon yo akòz sistèm lapè ki egziste alantou atletik.
 Mwen panse se poutèt sa ou wè diferans sa a souvan, men yo sèvi yon wòl trè menm jan an nan yo te eleman nan pwogram edikasyon nou an, angaje elèv yo ak fè yo vin isit la franchman ak nan kou pran plezi ak jwenn pi plis nan edikasyon yo.
 Se konsa, mwen kontan envestige pwoblèm sa a epi wè si genyen

 Se konsa, mwen te panse mwen ta mande yon lòt kesyon nan mwen ke mwen te wè te gen yon twalèt ki gen rapò pwojè.
 Ankò, sa a se katriyèm ane mwen ak katriyèm ane elèv yo nan ap eseye konnen ki jan yo bay pwodwi règ bay elèv nou yo.
 Ala anbarasan.
 Mwen konnen se pa tout moun ki nan reyinyon sa a dakò, men li difisil.
 Pwojè CCSR la ap kouri pandan kat ane youn apre lòt pou asire elèv ki gen règ yo pa gen pwoblèm pou jwenn aksè nan pwodui sa yo.
 Kalite eksitan.
 Mwen jis vle fè li klè ke mwen pa vote pou pèsonn
 Renovasyon nan twalèt si chak twalèt ki repare pa gen ladann yon dispansè pwodwi règ gratis.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3762.382s">[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>: Doktè Edward Vincent?
 Mesye Russo, mwen jis vle fè kòmantè ke lè ou fè liy sa yo fè ou kwè ke lè elèv yo itilize twalèt la nan lekòl segondè epi yo pa gen aksè a pwodwi Rezèv tanpon fanm, nou gen yon chanm medikal antye.
 Pwodwi fanm yo mete nan twalèt, men malerezman, pafwa pwodwi Rezèv tanpon fanm yo pa itilize pou objektif yo.
 Yo itilize, dekore nan twalèt epi finalman enstale sou plafon.
 Sa a te rive plizyè fwa.
 Sa a se yon twalèt ki sipèvize ak kontwole.
 Se konsa, nou mete nou deyò, etidyan CCSR, e mwen fè sa kòm yon pwojè, men mwen vle moun yo konnen ke pwodwi Rezèv tanpon fanm yo disponib nan sal medikal la ak ke elèv yo pa refize aksè.
 Nou gen yon pakèt pwodwi nan domèn medikal, epi mwen pa opoze ak jwenn machin ke elèv yo ka itilize, men mwen jis vle fè remake ke lè nou bay yo, yo pa itilize yo pou objektif yo.
 Sa a se yon pati nan rezon ki fè yo te fini yo te elimine nan tan lontan an.
 Se konsa, mwen ta jis di, nou pa ap eseye adrese elèv oswa di yo, ou konnen, sa a pa disponib.
 Mwen vle tout moun konnen ke li disponib e ke espesyalman sal medikal lekòl segondè ak lekòl segondè gen ase founiti.
 Sèvis sa a disponib pou tout randevou swen.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3866.52s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: Mèsi.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=3872.29s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: Wi, mwen konprann.
 Mwen pa ta janm konseye pèsonn eseye refize bagay sa yo.
 Mwen jis sijere ke nou pran yon kat jeyografik nan lekòl la ak imajine yon elèv nan pwen ki pi lwen nan sal medikal la.
 Mwen vle di, nan manm komite lekòl la, mwen se sèl isit la
 Li pa t gen eksperyans sa yo.
 Mwen jis fè sipozisyon sou nou tout, men, ou konnen, menm mwen pa ka imajine ke yo byen lwen bay medikal la nan gwo bilding sa a, epi ou di ou konnen ki kote li ye.
 Mwen te pase bò kote bilding lan pou m wè sa li te ye.
 Mwen te di, anvan tout bagay, sa a se pa yon ti mache de minit.
 Nou ap pale de, mwen vle di, mwen pa menm konnen ki lè a ye, men mwen devine,
 Ki sa nou panse kòm baryè nan aksè sanble yo trè, trè ba oswa trè wo, kèlkeswa analoji ki kòrèk.
 Mwen, ou konnen, gen lòt zòn ki te fè sa e mwen pa fè sa, yo pa te nan premye paj la nan mond lan kòm yon gwo pwoblèm.
 Mwen konnen, sa mwen li sou sante a, se pa lwa Healthy Youth Act, mwen bliye sa lalwa te ekzije aktyèlman nan lekòl ane pase a,
 Men, te gen yon sitiyasyon orijinal, lè ou fèk enstale yo epi fè yo disponib pou gratis, yo te kole nan plafon an ak timoun yo ki te bezwen yo te kapab pran panyen lakay yo plen ak yo.
 Men, tankou anpil bagay, yo ka vin raz.
 Lè sa a, lè elèv yo bezwen yo, yo la.
 Se konsa, mwen pa vle sa a yo dwe yon pwojè senp.
 Mwen jis fèm kwè
 CCSR, mwen panse ke sa a se yon pwojè CCSR, li te antre nan bwat resepsyon Facebook mwen an yon semèn de sa, mwen panse ke li te sou elèv yo fè sa.
 Yo pa fè sa paske yo pa gen anyen ankò pou yo fè.
 Kidonk mwen panse ke nou pa koute etidyan nou yo.
 Map gade paj CCSR 2016 la, youn nan pwojè ane sa a.
 Mwen pa konnen ki lè nou pral kapab fè sa, men mèsi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4015.74s">[Kathy Kreatz]</a>: Wi, mwen jis vle di ou mèsi.
 Premye a tout, mwen jis gen yon kesyon sou transpòtasyon, men anvan mwen vle tout moun konnen ke se te yon prezantasyon bèl, Mesye McLaughlin, ou te fè yon gwo travay, ak ki sa atik ajanda sa yo ye.
 Sa a pral sou ajanda semèn pwochèn e nou pral diskite sou li nan reyinyon sou-komite semèn pwochèn.
 So mon annan en lot kestyon lo transportasyon.
 Yon bagay sou sa a se paske mwen te louvri bilten an paske mwen pa sonje nan yon reyon mil.
 Se konsa, mwen li yon konsèy sou transpòtasyon pandan Kobe Olympics 2021 yo, epi li te di ke tout lekòl piblik pa t ap chèche oswa depoze elèv nan lekòl jòn, kèlkeswa si adrès fizik yo te nan yon reyon de mil nan lekòl la.
 Nou konnen chanjman sa a se yon fado enpòtan epi nou toujou ofri anbake pi wo pase sa ki espesifye.
 Se konsa, mwen pa menm sèten si mwen gen bon enfòmasyon.
 Msye Murphy, mwen pa gen okenn enfòmasyon sou sitiyasyon ou mansyone a.
 Mwen pa sonje yon reyinyon sou sa.
 Se konsa, mwen jis vle mansyone sa.
 mwen konnen Mrs.
 Van der Kloot te pale sou sa.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4092.141s">[David Murphy]</a>: Mesye, mwen jis vle klarifye.
 Mwen di sa ak yon non responsabilite ke sa te rive anvan mwen vin isit la, men mwen te patisipe depi tout tan.
 Si yon moun, si kòlèg mwen yo vle pataje souvni yo, tanpri pa fè sa.
 Men, jan yo te eksplike m, lè yo te bay komite a yon reyon 2.0 mil,
 Mwen konnen sa a se pou klas segondè.
 Ankò, gen yon limit sou sa a, tankou mwen te, mwen panse ke mwen te di nan lekòl klas sou yon mil ak yon mwatye, men li nan fondamantalman pa aplike.
 Anplis de sa, pou diminye kantite total moun k ap vwayaje nan otobis, li nesesè pou w fè founisè yo konnen pou yo aplike yon reyon yon mil nan nivo prensipal ak yon reyon de mil nan nivo segondè.
 Hey, li.
 Franchman, kantite moun k ap vwayaje nan otobis yo tèlman diminye, li pa klè si founisè yo bezwen aplike yon reyon yon mil.
 By wout la, mwen dwe di, sa a pa aplike nan jadendanfan tou.
 Se konsa, eksepsyon yo se egzanpsyon sekirite pou jadendanfan ak elèv ki gen andikap, ak transpò nan plan edikasyon endividyèl, ki nan kou pa enpòtan tou pou konvèsasyon sa a.
 Men, reyon yon mil ak de mil, youn baze sou restriksyon COVID ak lòt la se
 Franchman, fondamantalman, se yon restriksyon ki pa aplike, ki pa estraòdinè nan kominote a, sitou lè gen plas nan bis la.
 Se sa ki nou ap abòde ete sa a, planifye wout ak arè ak machann ki nan reyon sa a.
 Founisè a te avèti ke si nou te fè sa nou ta ka fini ak 18 bis yo prevwa nan kontra a.
 Avèk apwobasyon ane pase a, nou ka sèlman bezwen yon flòt 17 otobis, ki ta libere 18 otobis pou bay yon dezyèm otobis pou lekòl segondè.
 Se konsa, mwen panse, Dr Cushing, mwen wè ou leve men ou.
 Si mwen fè nenpòt erè tanpri santi yo lib pou korije m '.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4219.238s">[Peter Cushing]</a>: Ou pa di anyen mal.
 Ou trè egzat.
 Mwen devine si ou ta ka di youn nan aspè pozitif nan pandemi an se ke li vrèman ranfòse relasyon ant direktè yo,
 Mwen mande eskiz bay ofisyèl vil yo ak paran yo ki pa t mansyone non yo ki vrèman angaje pou etabli wout ki an sekirite pou ale lekòl, diminye anprint gaz fosil nou yo atravè plis otobis ki kanpe ak ale, epi kreye otobis lekòl ki ka mache ki bay elèv yo yon fason ki an sekirite pou ale ak soti lekòl.
 Epi gade lòt fason pou asire ke nou ap bay timoun nou yo aksè an sekirite nan lekòl, men tou rekonèt ke, byenke sa a se yon pwoblèm ki te kondwi pa pandemi an, gen lòt pwoblèm ki gen rapò ak konbistib fosil, transpò, konjesyon, elatriye ke mwen ta di ke tout direktè lekòl primè ak presegondè nou yo te reflechi sou yo pandan nou te gen konvèsasyon sa yo pandan ane pase a.
 Yo te rankontre ak moun epi yo te trase wout pou ale lekòl.
 Nou jwenn done kat GIS nan tout kote elèv yo.
 Lè nou te gen pandemi an, nou te fè yon analiz trè apwofondi pou vrèman gade tout bagay sa yo, epi answit nou te gade opòtinite pandemi an ka genyen pou chanje abitid ak mantalite.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4309.15s">[Kathy Kreatz]</a>: Mèsi.
 Mèsi.
 Mwen gen yon kesyon tou sou petèt enfòmasyon sante pou pwochen ane lekòl la.
 Mesye Murphy, mwen pa sèten si ou deja isit la, men Patterson konnen sa.
 Paske nou tounen lekòl anvan Jounen Travay la ak MBTA a, te gen enkyetid ke MBTA a pa disponib pou elèv lekòl segondè yo nan jou ki mennen nan Jounen Travay la.
 Kèk jou anvan Jounen Travay la, timoun yo tounen lekòl.
 Mwen, ou konnen, nou ta resevwa mesaj nan men elèv k ap tann nan estasyon bis la epi otobis la pa t la.
 Yo fini mache epi yo an reta pou lekòl.
 Se konsa, prepare pou ane lekòl kap vini an.
 Yo te ajoute yon otobis lekòl jòn, epi pou premye jou yo li pral kondui nan kèk nan arè ki pi souvan pou vin chèche elèv lekòl segondè yo.
 Mwen pa sonje tout detay yo, men mwen jis vle fè w konnen ke sa a se yon pwoblèm kontinyèl.
 Chak ane, paske nou kòmanse anvan jou travay.
 Lè sa a, apre Jounen Travay la, otobis MBT yo pral kouri pandan lè lekòl regilye yo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4398.254s">[David Murphy]</a>: dam.
 Kreatz, mwen vrèman apresye li.
 Sa a se pa yon bagay mwen abitye avèk yo.
 Mwen pral edike tèt mwen pi vit ke posib.
 Mon premye kestyon se ki sa ki arive avek sa bis apre Labour Day?
 Paske si li te disponib semèn sa a, mwen ta yon ti kras kirye pou konnen ki jan oswa poukisa li te disponib.
 Sa mwen vle di sou sa a se,</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4416.775s">[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>: Sa a se yon pratik depi lontan nan Medford ak Eastern Bus Company konnen sa paske nou kòmanse lekòl pi bonè pase anpil distri lekòl vwazen, kidonk yo fè li epi yo ka ajiste otobis yo pou ede nou pase twa premye jou yo anvan lòt distri lekòl yo kòmanse lekòl.
 Alors zot kapab fer sa, i en keksoz ki zot abitye avek e definitivman nou pou kontinyen sa manm Kreatz.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4444.807s">[David Murphy]</a>: Mèsi.
 Wi, mwen panse ke nou pral sètènman kontinye pratike sa a epi, nan reyinyon an ak Eastern Buses, mwen panse ke nou pral tou mete aksan sou pwoblèm nan kapasite paske lè nou te diskite sou sa a nan dat 26 avril, santiman mwen te tande nan men komite a se ke si gen yon fason pri-efikas bay plis transpò otobis jòn nan lekòl segondè, Lè sa a, se yon bagay nou ta dwe gade.
 Se konsa, ankò, nou pral gen yon anpil nan konvèsasyon ak yo se yon patnè reyèlman bon.
 Trè popilè ane pase a.
 Se konsa, mwen espere ke nou ka kontinye gen konvèsasyon ak yo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4480.762s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Mèsi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4482.966s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Manm Kongrè Graham.
 Mèsi.
 Mwen vrèman apresye konsantre sou devlopman pwofesyonèl nan konsèy sipèvizè a, e sètènman yon modèl train-the-trainer kapab vrèman efikas toutotan gen yon plan devlopman dirab ki akonpaye fòmasyon fòmasyon yo, olye ke yon modèl train-the-trainer.
 Yon kòmansman etap demaraj echwe paske kòmanse sou yon tren, pwogram otobis la te twò chè, kidonk mwen jis te vle asire w ke nou te gen yon plan dirabilite an plas pou vrèman maksimize envestisman an.
 Lo sa zafer transpor, mon ti ava anvi en mosyon ki demande ki bidze i enkli oubyen sipoze ki apati 21-22 lannen akademik napa ankor depans transport pour nou bann etidyan.
 Gouvernman pou soumet nou en plan konpreansiv ki etablir bann propozisyon transpor pou sa zonn avan le 1 Out.
 Rezon ki fè mwen te ajoute sa a nan fen se paske
 Mwen tande nan men anpil moun ke timoun k ap pran otobis MBTA yo vle di yo souvan an reta epi yo pa fyab, e ke paran yo ap fè lòt aranjman pou mennen timoun yo lekòl paske yo santi yo pa ka fè otobis MBTA yo konfyans.
 Panse gen lòt elèv ki konte anpil sou pas otobis MBTA sa yo
 Mon personnelman mon pa’n tande ki i kapab travay e monte bis en diferan fason, me mon pa oule inyore ki i annan bann manm kominote ki dan sa sityasyon.
 Donk, mwen espere ke nou abòde pwoblèm trafik yo ankò e mwen espere ke tout moun pral kolabore ak Eastern Bus Company, depatman lapolis ak nenpòt lòt ajans.
 Nou espere ke kominote a ka konnen ki pi bon chemen pou pi devan.
 Doktè Cushing, mwen pral di w tou, mwen sonje konvèsasyon an sou reyon yon mil oswa de mil ak bagay konsa sou pa aplike reyon an nan nivo lekòl primè.
 Lè Mesye Murphy te pale sou jadendanfan se yon eksepsyon, mwen devine mwen te kòmanse panse si aplike konsa,
 Yon mil kont de mil oswa yon bagay tankou sa.
 Sepandan, ou toujou gen pou pran elèv kindergart ou nan yon kote ou pa t 'ta ale anvan.
 Kijan ou pratikman oswa taktikman sèvi sèlman elèv jadendanfan nan reyon ki pi pre a?
 So mon krwar i annan bokou diskisyon lo transpor ki bezwen ganny adrese.
 Men, mwen espere bidjè a byen klè reflete ke elèv yo pa pral gen difikilte pou ale lekòl ane pwochèn.
 Èske ou vle rele oswa mwen ta dwe poze lòt kesyon?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4679.808s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Mwen jis vle li, ou vle li, mwen jis pa konnen kisa administratè yo pral mete nan bidjè a si yo pa ban nou plan sa a anvan 1ye Out.
 Se konsa, mwen jis vle asire w ke jesyon ak ekip finans la okouran de sa.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4694.075s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Mwen panse ke ekip finans la ka kalkile sa lè nou jwenn quote final la.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4699.617s">[David Murphy]</a>: Oke, mwen devine sèl bagay mwen vle di se, Merrick,
 Mwen konprann mosyon an vle di ke nou pa vle okenn elèv depann sou yon pas MBTA ki dwe achte ak pwòp lajan pa yo pou ale lekòl.
 Koulye a, mwen panse ke gen diferan fason yo eksplore kesyon sa a.
 Mwen panse ke fason ki pi ekonomik se ajoute yon otobis jòn, omwen yon lòt otobis jòn.
 Kòm mwen te di, sa a ta ka gratis.
 Nan teyori, sa a ta ka bidjè-net.
 Mwen panse ke pi lwen pase sa, ta ka gen plis pase yon otobis jòn, ak Lè sa a, ta ka gen nenpòt lòt otobis men youn, ki ta definitivman gen yon kalite enpak sou bidjè a.
 Apre sa, yon lòt pwoblèm mwen panse ke nou dwe adrese se pral gen elèv ki vle rabè pas MBTA.
 Mwen pa aksepte mosyon pou rekòmande pou nou mete fen nan patenarya nou ak MBTA epi sispann ofri pas MBTA paske si gen elèv ki vle achte yon pas pou nenpòt rezon,
 Nou sètènman vle elèv nou yo kapab resevwa pas rabè menm jan ak elèv ki nan lòt distri lekòl yo.
 Se konsa, mwen panse ke nou pral kontinye pwogram sa a, men mwen panse ke nou jis bezwen esansyèlman egzaminen ki jan pas yo yo itilize nan mitan elèv yo.
 Kidonk, si yo konte sou li, nou bezwen peye pou pas MBTA oswa bay elèv yo opsyon altènatif pou ale lekòl.
 kounye a mwen vle
 Tout depann sou konbyen pas nou vann ak konbyen elèv ki achte yo konte sou yo.
 Se konsa, ki wout otobis la jòn?
 Gen sètènman kouch nan sa a, men gen sètènman konsèy klè nan men komite a.
 Si nou gen nenpòt pwoblèm ak ekzekisyon, kit nan yon pèspektiv bidjè oswa lojistik, nou pral tounen.
 Pou mwen, li posib ke ta ka gen yon gwoup elèv
 Lè nou di, ok, w ap achte pas sa a paske ou bezwen li pou ale lekòl, paske ou bezwen li pou ale nan travay, paske ou jis vle yon pas MBTA rabè.
 Yo pral di, koute, monchè, mwen jis vle yon pas.
 Men $30 mwen.
 Mwen ta enkyete w pou m ale lekòl.
 Nan pwen sa a, mwen pa panse ke nou vyole politik.
 Mwen panse ke nou te jwenn yon elèv ki deside pran MBTA a epi ale lekòl kèlkeswa si li te rive alè oswa non.
 Ankò, mwen panse ke entansyon an trè, trè klè.
 Mwen panse ke nou pral fè tout sa nou kapab pou ranfòse li.
 Si nou twouve nou nan yon sitiyasyon ki tou senpleman pa posib ni nan yon pèspektiv bidjetè oswa tou senpleman nan yon pèspektiv aplikasyon, nou pral oblije kenbe yon dyalòg ouvè ak Komisyon an.
 Men, mwen sètènman konprann entansyon an.
 Kòm mwen te di, nou pral fè tout sa nou kapab pou fè sa.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4879.947s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Se konsa, ki jan ou ta renmen rezolisyon an dwe libellé?
 Depite Graham ak mesye Murphy pou nou konnen sa nou pral wè nan 1ye jen, pa 1ye Out.
 Mwen panse ke sa trè klè.
 Bon, ou mansyone dat 1ye Out la, mwen jis vle konnen ki sa mwen ap sipòte, ki sa ki pral disponib ak ki lè.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4905.178s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Kidonk, bidjè a pral gen ladan sipozisyon ke ale lekòl pa koute anyen.
 Jiska lè sa a, plan transpò revize ak estrateji yo pa yon bagay ki rezonab ka akonpli.
 Sa a se konbyen tan li pral jiska 1ye Out.
 Kanta spesifik yo, èske pas MBTA gratis pou tout moun oubyen èske gen yon estrateji otobis jòn e se sa n ap chanje?
 Nan yon reyon youn a de mil, tout bagay sa yo pral evidamman gen yon enpak sou bidjè a, menm jan ak tout sa ki rive nan distri a apre bidjè a ap apwouve.
 Men bidjè a dwe reflete kapasite pri ki pèmèt nou ale lekòl san nou pa mande elèv yo peye.
 Gen li, Mesye Murphy?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=4960.204s">[David Murphy]</a>: Yeah, mwen vle di, mwen panse ke sèl opozisyon an, epi mwen pa reyèlman ap eseye fè serye sou sa a, se mwen pa panse ke nou ap mande pèsonn peye pou ale lekòl kounye a.
 An reyalite, gen kèk elèv k ap monte otobis MBTA, e otobis jòn lekòl nou an teyorikman pa gen ase kapasite, kidonk yo bezwen chwazi yo selon kote y ap viv, sitiyasyon fanmi yo oswa lòt sikonstans.
 Kidonk, an reyalite, yo peye pou yo ale lekòl, men se pa tankou règleman distri a di nou p ap kite ou nan yon otobis MBTA sof si ou nan yon otobis MBTA ke ou peye pou.
 Se konsa, mwen panse ke nou vle kolekte done sou popilasyon elèv aktyèl la ak èspere ke tou gade sou yon peryòd de tan ak wè konbyen pas MBTA nou vann epi asime ke se limit la ke nou gen pou ofri.
 Se konsa, mwen panse ke nou pral wè si nou ka diminye sa nan yon pèspektiv pri nan ogmante kapasite nan otobis jòn yo.
 Kidonk mwen panse lè nou vann pas MBTA, paske jan nou te diskite anvan, nou pa vle anpeche elèv nou yo jwenn pas rabè.
 Se konsa, mwen panse ke nou dwe kolekte done sou pas yo.
 Èske pas la itilize selon preferans, oswa èske li achte plis dapre preferans oswa mank de li?
 Lòt fason pou ale lekòl.
 Alor mon krwar lentansyon i tre kler.
 Kòm mwen te di, nou pral egzekite li byen epi nou sèlman gen pou tounen lè nou frape yon obstak lojistik oswa bagay yo kòmanse parèt enposib.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5068.707s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: Konsernan sa mosyon, mersi.
 Jis pou klarifye,
 Soti nan pèspektiv, mwen devine mwen jis ap eseye klarifye si gen yon bagay konsa, men pwoblèm nan depi lontan se ke nou gen elèv ki peye frè, anpil nan yo ki defavorize ekonomikman,
 Pwobableman nan yon reyon de mil, oswa omwen nan yon reyon de mil.
 Si w panse sou limit reyon de mil, di, elèv ki nan katye McGlynn, toupre McGlynn High School, ap mache pou ale ak pou soti nan lekòl paske yo pa gen mwayen oswa yo oblije chwazi, ou konnen, peye $30 pa mwa pou yon pas rabè, sa ta ka gen yon gwo enpak sou fanmi yo.
 Mwen panse ke li jis
 Valè moral yo se yon deklarasyon, ak bidjè nou an reflete valè nou yo, e mwen devine mwen sezi wè jan istorikman, menm komite lekòl la chita sou lòt bò a nan podium la, elèv yo dwe peye pou sa.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5201.555s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Wi.
 7 si wi; 0 si non.
 Mouvman an pase.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5205.937s">[David Murphy]</a>: Mwen regrèt, mwen pa ka konprann sa a.
 Mwen ta dwe poze kesyon sa a anvan li te deplase, men mwen jis vle poze yon kesyon ki pi klarifye.
 Wi, i annan en mosyon pou annan en reyon 3 kilomet pou lekol segonder akoz anba sa polisi aktyel, menm si nou debake bann jòn, sa bann etidyan pa pou pran bann jòn.
 Men mwen menm, mwen pa konnen, mwen pa konnen kisa pas MBTA a fè, men si yon elèv abite nan yon kat kilomèt de yon lekòl, nou toujou pral asire w ke elèv la gen transpò gratis, menm si
 Èske gen règleman menm jan an konsidere mache ale lekòl?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5248.902s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Non, mwen vle di, si lalwa oblije elèv yo mache ale lekòl, mwen dakò ak kontinye fè sa.
 Koulye a, mwen pa mande pou nou mòde nan pòm sa a tèt nou.
 Mwen enkyete pou moun ki rete plis pase twa kilomèt de lekòl epi ki gen pou peye pou ale lekòl.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5273.365s">[David Murphy]</a>: Si w nan plis pase 2 mil de lekòl la epi andeyò reyon lekòl la, ou konnen, yon moun kòmanse resevwa yon otobis jòn gratis epi yo di yon lòt moun li dwe peye $30 pa mwa pou yon pas MBTA.
 Sa a se ekzòbitan.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5288.911s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Wi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5289.571s">[David Murphy]</a>: Si sa se pwoblèm nou ap eseye rezoud, mwen panse ke li entelijan.
 Se sa nou ka obsève.
 Lalwa, pou nou klè, se ke pèsonn ki gen plis pase 6 an pa gen dwa monte nan transpò.
 Se poutèt sa gen yon lwa ki fè respekte règleman ki egziste deja nan yon reyon de mil, ki se trè inifòm atravè Commonwealth la.
 Li fè sans epi nou ka fè li.
 Men kanmenm, repons ou a di m ke nou tout dakò sou sa inegalite ye e se sa nou vle adrese.
 Nou pral devlope yon plan ki konsistan avèk vòt pou reyalize objektif sa a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5326.754s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: Mon kapab fer komanter lo sa lenformasyon akoz mon pa sir ki i kler sa ki nou pe diskit, omwen ki mannyer mon santi, e mon anvi klarifikasyon.
 Majistra, mwen ka fè sa?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5336.458s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Manm Kongrè McLaughlin, mesaj la klè.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5341.68s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: Mèsi.
 Mwen panse ke pwoblèm espesifik mwen an se ke elèv finansyèman defavorize yo dwe peye
 Transpò pou ale lekòl.
 Kidonk, kit li nan yon reyon de mil, oswa yon reyon de mil, oswa yon reyon yon mil oswa kèlkeswa sa nou ofri.
 Mwen konnen nan tan lontan pwofesè yo ta peye pou fè elèv yo antre nan MBTA.
 Transpò pase.
 Donk, Msye Murphy, nan pwen ou a, sa ka mande pou plis konsiderasyon, pa nesesèman sou mosyon an patikilye oswa sipleman, ou konnen, mosyon ki te pase, men nan pwen ou, sa a pèmèt pou pas MBTA yo dwe pèmèt yo nan vil la, yo ka pèmèt yo pou sal klas nan vil la, yo ka pèmèt yo pou opòtinite travay,
 Yo ka pèmèt transpòtasyon pou ale lekòl.
 Souseri ki pi enpòtan an ki enkyete m: Èske w ap poze kesyon?
 Wi.
 Nan konsiderasyon sa a, èske nou konsantre sou moun ki defavorize ekonomikman?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5405.854s">[David Murphy]</a>: Bon, mon krwar sa mosyon... mon krwar i pou tou dimoun.
 Wi, mwen panse ke se ka a.
 Wi, li pi laj pase ekonomikman defavorize, men li pa enkli elèv ki nan yon reyon de mil.
 Sa a ban nou yon pwen done ki sanble ak sa Dr Grisham te pale sou pi bonè sou lè l sèvi avèk GPS yo idantifye nan yon pèspektiv grafik done, ou konnen, kote nou ka di, oke, sa a se popilasyon elèv nou an epi nou bezwen asire w ke yo ale nan lekòl gratis.
 Menm jan ak sa nou te fè anvan Jounen Travay la, si nou tou senpleman mete yon otobis nan sal la, nou ta ka akomode pifò elèv yo.
 Si nou ka fè sa, mwen panse ke li ta ka yon direktiv trè fasil yo swiv.
 Si nou gade sa epi nou di, oke, otobis sa a nou te itilize anvan Jou travay la te sèlman sèvi 15 pousan nan elèv nou yo.
 Pou sèvi diferan zòn nan kominote a, nou bezwen sis nouvo bis.
 So petet nou pou retourn e dir nou pou bezwen rekonstri en lot fason akoz nou napa en fason dirab pou fer sa kounya.
 Se konsa, nan pwen sa a, nou ka oblije etwat ki moun nou vize ki ekonomikman defavorize paske Madam McLaughlin te di.
 Ankò, mwen pa konnen egzakteman ki rezilta a pral ye, men mwen panse ke nou gen yon direksyon klè e nou kontan pou avanse pou pi devan.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5490.787s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Mèsi.
 Manm Kongrè Graham, epi apre manm Kongrè a McLaughlin.
 Apre manm Ruseau, apre manm Kreatz.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5499.15s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Mèsi.
 Mwen te yon ti kras sezi wè pa gen okenn chanjman travay oswa rekòmandasyon nan depatman finans la paske mwen te gen yon santiman
 Biwo a toujou gen twòp travay pou fè pou kantite anplwaye nan biwo a.
 Kisa sa ye?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5519.74s">[David Murphy]</a>: Mwen te di, sa a se enpresyon mwen tou, men se pa isit la.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5523.442s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Sa a se vre, men nou pa mande pou yon solisyon a pwoblèm sa a isit la.
 poukisa se sa?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5527.325s">[David Murphy]</a>: Paske nan komite a, ou pral sonje, sa yo te defann pou ane fiskal 2021 se te esansyèlman yon kapasite de chèz.
 Sa nou te eseye fè se, anvan tout bagay, nan devwa chapit 70 la, nou te ajoute pozisyon kontwolè a.
 Sa se madam.
 Kingdon jwe yon gwo wòl nan fè l 'gade mwens estipid chak semèn pase li anjeneral fè.
 Li pote tou ladrès kontablite ak eksperyans ki pa te kouvri nan lekòl lalwa, ke mwen rekonesan pou.
 Anplis de sa,
 Nou te reyaji pozisyon Asistan Administratif la ki te evolye nan wòl Koòdonatè Sibvansyon an epi nou te repositionne li nan Biwo Finans lan kòm Koòdonatè Sibvansyon an.
 Se poutèt sa nou te elaji kapasite pwodiksyon nou an nan nivo prezan.
 Ou pral jwenn, um, sou echèl salè ou, asistan administratif, ranplasman pou pozisyon asistan administratif la, mwen regrèt, pou rezime,
 Tout bagay sa yo fini nan ane fiskal 2021.
 Bidjè net nan bidjè Koòdonatè Sibvansyon an te garanti ankò atravè yon sibvansyon Chapit 70 nan mwa Out.
 Sa ogmante kapasite nou yo epi pèmèt nou pi byen sèvi rejyon an.
 Sèl priyorite ki rete nan bidjè finansye ak operasyon yo se nivo salè.
 Anvan nou fè sa, ou ta dwe pale ak moun nan tout distri a, jis yo dwe klè sou ki echèl salè a se nan tout distri a, pozisyon nan asistan administratif ki kounye a sipòte de sipèentandan asistan, lè yo ranpli, pral sipòte tout twa sipèentandan asistan, kidonk sa ap ogmante kapasite biwo finans lan nan zòn sa a.
 Se konsa, aktyèlman, nou pral genyen,
 Ankor, nou napa okenn lentansyon pour ogmant size nou departman finans.
 Ou tande m 'di yè swa ke priyorite bidjè yo devlope nan kad Bidjè 22 yo se kondwi pa sa ki pi dirèkteman sipòte elèv yo.
 Mwen ka sètènman konprann ke moun ki travay nan kominote lekòl yo ta santi ke biwo finans ak operasyon yo pa nesesèman pi pre timoun yo.
 Men, pou nou sèvi zòn nan pi byen e pou nou benefisye timoun yo, nou bezwen gen bon anplwaye.
 Lè nou ajoute yon pòs Koòdonatè Sibvansyon, yon pòs Direktè Finans, ak kèk pòs Asistan Administratif, nou kwè nou pral pi byen kapab fè sa.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5687.179s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Mèsi.
 Lè sa a, dènye kòmantè mwen te jis di mwen pa apwouve depans lajan
 Finansman kapital pou twalèt oswa teyat Karen oswa pwojè restorasyon antre jiskaske gen yon plan jeneral vre ki adrese bezwen alontèm lekòl segondè a.
 Sa se anpil lajan.
 Total la se anviwon yon ka milyon dola, ki pa ensiyifyan lè nou di,
 Tankou 10 pwofesyonèl pouvwa, anpil ak anpil pwofesè, moun nou pa t 'kapab antre nan bidjè a.
 Anplis depans san yon plan konstriksyon klè, gen anpil lòt priyorite.
 Mwen te di sa anvan, men gen yon plan klè pou bilding sa a enpòtan anpil.
 Jiska lè sa a, mwen pa ka sipòte depans fon kominote a nan yon fason ki fèmen nou nan, oswa mare men nou, pou satisfè pi gwo bezwen bilding nan, ki poko evalye.
 Mèsi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5768.462s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Nan pwen sa a, si ou ta ka lonje dwèt sou 800,000 plis nan chodyèr yo ak laboratwa syans yo ak 100,000 yo ki gen pou ale nan pwojè kapital yo.
 Se konsa, mwen panse ke gen anpil.
 Lekòl segondè a bezwen anpil konsantre ak yon komite vizyon, ak travay nou fè a pral pran plizyè ane.
 Kidonk, mwen vle di, mwen pa dakò avèk respè.
 Mwen vle mete aksan sou sa.
 Manm Kongrè McLaughlin.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5796.765s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: Mèsi.
 Mwen gen kèk kesyon.
 Mwen te panse mwen ta kòmanse ak sa a paske li se dènye sijè a.
 Mwen devine mwen ta renmen pwochen ajanda a enkli Komite Vizyon MHS la pou nou konnen ki kote yo kanpe lè nou panse sou depans lajan.
 Mwen jis pa vle gaspiye bon lajan apre yon move bagay.
 Te gen anpil diskisyon sou lekòl segondè a epi nou poko gen yon komite vizyon.
 Mwen espere mete sa nan pwochen ajanda a.
 Kidonk, pou nou retounen sou sijè transpò a, èske Prezidan an ta mande kisa Mesye Murphy te vle di lè l lye opòtinite pwogram yo ak akizisyon li yo?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5840.763s">[David Murphy]</a>: Èske sa nan youn nan dokiman yo?
 Jwenn plis enfòmasyon background.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5847.308s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: Mwen pa konnen, mwen pa konprann sa w ap di a.
 Ou tap pale de transpò, e m regrèt mwen site ou.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5854.951s">[David Murphy]</a>: Padon, mwen te panse nou tap pale de pas MBTA.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5857.612s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: Wi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5858.012s">[David Murphy]</a>: Sa mwen te di a, mwen panse ou te fè yon kòmantè menm jan an, madam.
 McLaughlin te di ke pase MBTA a se yon bon envestisman pou elèv ki ale lekòl.
 Si gen yon korelasyon ant achte pas MBTA, yo se yon gwo envestisman.
 Pwogram ak opòtinite ansèyman angaje elèv yo nan kominote a epi bay opòtinite aprantisaj eksperyans.
 Mwen pa konnen, sètènman gen anpil pwofesè ak CCR, CCSR se yon bèl egzanp, men gen anpil opòtinite ansèyman nan lekòl segondè ki anvayi kominote a ak mond edikasyon an an jeneral, pi lwen pase salklas la.
 Men, si nou vle ogmante envestisman
 Ak envesti nan MBTA Pass la, donk nan opinyon mwen, si nou fè sa epi panse nan yon pèspektiv ansèyman epi eseye elaji opòtinite aprantisaj eksperyans nou yo, mwen panse ke nan tèt li se omwen yon bon bagay, men li anplifye lè nou tou bay kalite resous sa yo pou fè yo pi aksesib pou elèv yo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=5931.149s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: Mèsi.
 Mwen panse se sa ou vle di e ou ta renmen klarifikasyon paske mwen imajine, pa egzanp, etidyan pwofesyonèl yo ap transpòte nan teren an, volontè CCSR ak tout kalite bagay sa yo.
 Kidonk, li ta enteresan pou wè ki opòtinite pwogramasyon an lè nou panse sou analiz pri diferan opsyon sa yo.
 Kidonk, mwen konnen nonsèlman nou gen Eastern Bus, men nou gen founisè transpòtasyon nou yo tou.
 Nou gen plizyè founisè anbake e gen kèk pwoblèm ant yo.
 Pèsonèlman, nou te gen kèk pwoblèm ak founisè transpò nou yo e mwen konnen li difisil pou kenbe oswa kenbe anplwaye yo.
 Espesyalman nan sitiyasyon aktyèl la.
 Men, m ap mande si gen yon opòtinite santralize, oswa prèske tankou yon solisyon C-click, ou konnen, yon opsyon, oswa, ou konnen, yon liy dirèk pou pote plent oswa yon lòt bagay, kote nou ka kolekte done nan kominote a sou sa ki aktyèlman ap pase ak transpò nou an, paske nou ap peye yon anpil lajan bay machann yo, epi mwen pa santi tankou machann yo responsab nan okenn fason.
 Sa machann yo ofri se enkonsistan, menm nan kèk nan kontra yo mwen te wè.
 Li totalman kont règ yo pou paran ou yo vini lakay ou ak yon lèt ki di ke si ou rate otobis la nan maten, yo pa pral vin chèche ou nan apremidi a, pa vre?
 Ou pa ka fè sa.
 Men, sa a se pou transpò edikasyon espesyal.
 Men, sa a se yon kat an patikilye ke nou te wè.
 Se sa m ap di.
 Li bezwen gen kèk konsistans nan kontra, bidjè, ak kalite pwosesis reklamasyon yo.
 poukisa wi
 En administrater i ekout konplent konsernan en depatman e en lot administrater i ekout bann konplent lo en lot depatman, tel ki lekel ki santralize sa bann konplent pour ki nou koman en komite lekol i konpran ki sa quotes sa bann machann ye e si i rezonnab.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6050.083s">[David Murphy]</a>: Non, mwen apresye ou mansyone sa, madam.
 McLaughlin ak mwen menm, jan nou te di nan kòmansman prezantasyon nou an, sa a se te youn nan rezon prensipal poukisa nou te vle restriktire anboche yon moun kle ki te dedye a fanmi an.
 Sa pa vle di ke yon fwa nou gen yon Direktè Angajman Fanmi, p'ap janm gen yon plent, oswa p'ap janm gen yon plent ki pa jwenn repons imedyat, substantif ke nou ta renmen, paske nati gwo òganizasyon yo se ke pafwa bagay rive ke nou pa vrèman jwenn jis kèk tan apre.
 Pafwa nou tande pale sou li, men gen konfli
 Ou konnen, sa a se yon istwa sou sa ki te reyèlman rive.
 Kidonk, mwen pa vle sijere ke lè yo reòganize biwo sa yo nan yon fason, pwoblèm adisyonèl pap janm parèt, paske, ou konnen, se reyalite a.
 An menm tan, sepandan, nou prevwa ke Biwo Angajman Fanmi an pral sèvi nan plizyè fason kòm yon fasilitatè santral ant biwo ki gen plis kontak dirèk ak souvan.
 Kominikasyon ak fanmi yo, ki gen ladan kèk pwogram swen anvan ak apre lekòl, pwosesis enskripsyon lè premye antre nan kominote lekòl la, sèvis medikal (kote kominikasyon ak fanmi yo souvan depann de lavi), ak nan kou edikasyon espesyal, nan ki transpò se yon gwo pati paske nou kominike avèk fanmi yo ak paran yo nan anviwònman ansèyman an,
 Kèk nan pwoblèm lojistik operasyon debaz sa yo se sa fanmi yo konte sou distri a plis pou yo adrese, pou di konsa, epi gen biwo sa yo ki reyon nan volan an, mwen panse ke yo pral itil nan yon pwendvi kominikasyon epi asire ke administratè ki bezwen konnen sou kèk nan pwoblèm sa yo resevwa notifikasyon rapidman.
 Donk, reprezantan McLaughlin, sèl bagay mwen pa dakò sou kòmantè w la se,
 Li rekòmande pou pa gen okenn founisè asime okenn responsablite.
 Responsablite ka rive nan diferan fason epi pafwa sou plizyè delè.
 Men, mwen ta di ke pandan ke gouvènman an ak nan kou Ms.
 Biwo Bowen a patikilyèman okouran de pwoblèm sa yo, epi nou pran yo oserye epi reponn yo.
 Si yon paran oswa yon gadyen vin konnen ke yon moun k ap bay swen pa ranpli responsablite li anvè yon elèv distri oswa yon fanmi, nou vle konnen sitiyasyon an imedyatman.
 Nou sètènman pran angajman pou nou toujou reponn avèk fòs paske sitiyasyon w ap dekri a, ou konnen, evakyasyon an konplètman inakseptab epi li pa yon bagay ke nou pral tolere.
 Bay pwòp ekip nou an oswa nenpòt founisè nou asosye ak.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6238.19s">[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>: Mèsi.
 Majistra, kite m klarifye, Dwayen Sèvis Elèv la te trè akeyan, men mwen te tou yon ti jan nan yon sèk bwi.
 Mon reflechi lo bann dimoun ki pa’n fer e ki mannyer zot fer fas avek e ki mannyer zot demontre ki transpor i marse.
 Franchman, mwen panse ke li gen fè ak koleksyon done.
 Genyen tou bagay tankou timoun yo an reta pou lekòl.
 Men ankò, mwen panse ke li enpòtan pou konsantre sou founisè nou yo.
 Finalman, mwen ta renmen yon lòt fwa ankò felisite sipèvizè a pou konsèy li sou pi gwo devlopman pwofesyonèl ak devlopman pwofesyonèl vize alantou patipri implicite ak aprantisaj sosyal-emosyonèl.
 Mwen tande de pwen sou devlopman pwofesyonèl nan men anplwaye ak manm kominote a ke mwen vle mete aksan sou.
 youn nan yo se
 Mwen panse ke kèk anplwaye pwofesyonèl pa nesesèman santi ke gen yon devlopman pwofesyonèl espesifik, ou konnen, trè espesifik lisans oswa bezwen, kidonk mwen te vle kouvri sa.
 Ou konnen, jis enkyete w sou asire angajman ak devlopman pwofesyonèl parapwofesyonèl yo, ki enpòtan pou parapwofesyonèl yo, li sanble tankou pyès aprantisaj sosyal-emosyonèl la definitivman pral fè pati nan li, men mwen vle asire w sou sa, e mwen konnen nan tan lontan, mwen panse ke anpil fwa parapwofesyonèl yo te ale kote pwofesè yo te ale.
 Yo se pwofesè asosye. Jan mwen konnen, ou konnen sa tou.
 Men, mwen panse ke li la tou bèl pou kapab bay moun kèk fleksibilite ak opsyon devlopman karyè.
 Kidonk, se pa bagay mwen ap tann repons pou aswè a, men mwen jis vle mansyone yo pou nou konnen.
 Mèsi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6353.346s">[Paul Ruseau]</a>: Mèsi, Majistra.
 Mwen konnen nou te pase yon rezolisyon sou plan transpò a.
 Lè m grandi, mwen te oblije mache yon mil nan estasyon otobis la chak jou.
 Si mwen rate bis la, mwen ta dwe mache 4 èdtan ak 29 minit pou m ale lekòl.
 Aparamman li se yon ti kras pi gwo pase Medford.
 Se konsa, 13 mil.
 Men, sa mwen vle di se eksperyans mwen nan pran otobis la oswa pa ale lekòl,
 Um, jis si w gade absans mwen nan, um, ou konnen, Massachusetts, mwen ta genlè gen DCF lakay mwen, franchman.
 Um, Se konsa, mwen jis espere ke lè nou fè plan, um, nou ap pale de de mil kont yon mil, um, mwen panse ke li gen yon ti kras fè ak nivo anplwaye mesye.
 Oke, mwen vle rankontre timoun yo nan yon reyon de mil.
 Yo an reta oswa yo absan pi souvan pase timoun ki andeyò yon reyon de mil.
 Mwen vrèman pa kwè ou kapab gen mwayen pou pase nan yon ane de pati ak yon ane de absans Et evalye distans pou lekòl Et si yo pran yon bis ou yon bagay konsa, sa sanble tankou anpil travay.
 Men, sa a se yon desizyon politik nou pran san yo pa konsidere enpak li.
 Rezilta edikasyon, paske, ou konnen, si nou toujou tounen sou sa a, si ou pa nan lekòl, sètènman ou pa ap aprann.
 Se konsa, ou konnen, pwòp eksperyans mwen ak ale nan estasyon otobis la oswa pa ale nan lekòl la, ki definitivman rive nan Medford tou.
 Alor ler nou pe koz lo en mil kont de mil, mon krwar nou bezwen osi rekonnet ki i pa zis lenpak finansyel.
 Afekte tout nòt yo.
 Sipèvizè a te vrèman renmen nòt MCAS li yo, ou konnen, yo se metrik la, si li renmen MCAS oswa ou pa, yo se metrik la, e sa enpòtan.
 Men, sa a se yon politik espesifik ki afekte mezi.
 Non, mwen vle di, non, mwen pa mande pou yon rapò, men mwen konnen nan eksperyans sa a se absoliman vre.
 Si w rate bis la, ou pa ka ale lekòl.
 Natirèlman, si mwen rate bis la epi mwen pa gen transpò, mwen pa ka mache ale lekòl, men
 Mwen sèten ke gen anpil timoun ki ta fouti si yo rate bis la.
 Men, pa gen otobis pou tout timoun ki nan reyon de mil sa a.
 Se konsa, lè nou jwenn yon gwo lapli, yon move lapli frèt, ke nou te souvan te genyen anvan rechofman planèt la pouse tanperati nan ane 70 yo, nan jou sa yo, si ou te pran otobis la,
 Kontrèman ak si ou pa pran otobis la epi atann pou w mache omwen 40 minit pou w ale lekòl.
 Se konsa, mwen pa gen okenn pwoblèm.</p>

 Yeah, donk, anrapò ak mosyon nou te fè aswè a, èske Msye Murphy ap ba nou yon rapò ki souliye plizyè depans, pa egzanp, èske nou pral sèvi ak otobis jòn pou tout elèv nan distri a, oswa èske nou pral gade nan achte pas MBTA pou tout elèv yo?
 Eske se yon pwopozisyon ki ka analize nan moman bidjè a pou nou konprann ki jan li anfòm nan bidjè a?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6595.799s">[David Murphy]</a>: Mwen panse ke nou pral eseye gen yon plan ki pa enkli elèv ki pa nan yon reyon de mil nan yon lekòl segondè ki konte sou yon pas MBTA ke yo dwe achte.
 Ki jan nou pral reyalize sa, mwen panse ke li pral pran nou yon ti tan pou kalkile li, men mwen jis di, mwen pa ta dwe espekile sou sa, men mwen jis pral di, zantray mwen di mwen ke sa a dwe yon plan ki gen plizyè aspè, ke nou pral ogmante kapasite nan otobis jòn yo.
 Nou gen X kantite pas MBTA epi distri a ap absòbe pri pas sa yo epi petèt ap eksplore
 Lòt asosyasyon ede peye pri jeneral la epi konsidere ki done nou ka kolekte pou detèmine baz pou elèv yo achte MBTA a.
 Se konsa, mwen panse ke yo fè sa, nou dwe gade nan chak levye.
 Mwen panse, dapre sa mwen konprann, si nou te konnen anvan 1ye Out
 Nou pral enfòme komite a ke sa a se pa yon bagay nou ka fè finansyèman oswa lojistik.
 Mwen panse ke mwen enfòme komite a olye ke yo jis voye jete men m 'ak di, dezole, nou pa ka fè sa.
 Mwen panse ke sa nou ta di se, ou konnen, anvan nou
 Sa yo se tout obstak nan lage elèv ki achte pas an gwo kantite.
 Se konsa, nan moman sa a, pou Mme.
 McLaughlin, Lè sa a, nou ka panse sou ki jan yo vize elèv ki defavorize ekonomikman.

 Mwen jis vle retounen epi adrese pwoblèm ke Konsèy Graham te soulve epi answit majistra a ak kòmantè Melanie McLaughlin te fè sou lekòl segondè.

 Okòmansman, pandemi an te entèvni yon ti tan apre eleksyon an nan mitan enkyetid sou konpozisyon komisyon an.
 Li enpòtan pou nou detèmine kote nou vle ale.
 Eske nou pral eli yon nouvo komite?
 Yon moun te eksprime enterè.
 Kounye a, nou bezwen fòme yon komite paske mwen konprann enkyetid Jenny.
 Mwen te vle tou asire w ke bilding lan te apwopriye pou timoun ki la yo.
 Se konsa, mwen panse ke gen yon
 Mwen panse ke gen yon mwayen ant pa fè anyen ak fè kèk amelyorasyon nesesè pou kenbe bilding lan nan yon kondisyon satisfezan.
 Fòm nan se fòm elèv la itilize kounye a.
 Men, sa ki pi enpòtan, nou dwe detèmine makiyaj nan komite vizyon an, sa nou mande yo, ak delè nou anvizaje.
 Petèt fen mwa Jen an se pa moman pou kòmanse ankò.
 Mwen wè.
 Men, nou dwe prepare pou konsantre sou kòmansman mwa septanm olye pou n tann yon lòt ane lekòl la pase.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6835.327s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Ann sipoze menm bagay la, ann kòmanse nan sezon otòn la epi nou gen lòt bagay, bidjè, lekòl Columbus, timoun ki tounen.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6842.173s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: Wi, men mwen panse nou bezwen pran yon desizyon, majistra, nou pa, nou pa ka tann jiska Septanm pou diskite sou sa nou pral fè.
 Non, non, jen nan kou.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6852.821s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Mwen panse ke Konsèy McLaughlin mansyone yon reyinyon k ap vini, oswa mwen panse ke yon reyinyon an jen.
 Reprezantan, Depite Van der Kloot, èske gen yon lòt bagay ou ta renmen di?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6862.049s">[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>: non mèsi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6868.149s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Madam cherif, manm Kongrè Graham.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6870.91s">[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>: Mwen vle di sèlman, mwen vle raple komite a, mwen kwè se te an Desanm 2019, lè mwen te ale devan konsèy la, $800,000 yo te allocate nan twalèt.
 Mwen jis vle
 Mwen ta renmen di ke mwen sipòte anpil renovasyon kèk nan twalèt yo nan konplèks lekòl segondè a paske yo gen gwo bezwen amelyorasyon ak renovasyon.
 Mwen dakò nou bezwen yon plan ki pi konplè, men twalèt ki pi modèn nan tout konplèks la se nan zèl syans.
 Sa a se pou tout konplèks la ak twalèt vrèman modèn.
 Se poutèt sa, se pa tout elèv ki sitiye nan zòn sa a nan bilding lan.
 Alor mon swete ki serten larzan ki ti ganny allocate an 2019 e akoz pandemi e tou sa ki nou vreman bezwen pou avans pou omwen renovasyon e amelyor serten fasilite.
 Gen kèk nan enstalasyon twalèt sa yo.
 Mwen panse ke sa enpòtan anpil.
 Epi, ou konnen, mwen jis reflechi sou bezwen elèv yo epi mwen te di mwen te vle yo gen twalèt ajou disponib.
 Kidonk, mwen jis vle raple komite a ke nou te pran yon angajman lè nou te resevwa lajan sa a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6969.628s">[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>: Mèsi, Dr Edward Vincent.
 Manm Kongrè Graham, epi apre manm Kongrè Kretz.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/-zTfqlt_PDw&t=6974.25s">[Jenny Graham]</a>: Mwen jis vle di ke mwen dakò ak Kongrè a Van der Kloot.
 Sa pa vle di nou opoze ak nenpòt nan pwojè sa yo, petèt yo tout fè sans, men mank enfòmasyon kounye a fè li posib pou nou pran desizyon ki depanse anpil lajan vil nan yon fason gratèl oswa nan yon fason ki fè tout bagay pi konplike.
 Lè nou aktyèlman diskite sou bezwen bilding ak ekspè, nou fè sa ki bezwen fè.
 Kidonk, tout moun ou pale ak yo gen yon opinyon sou sa ki ta dwe rive nan Medford High School, e mwen apresye opinyon tout moun, men pral gen yon lè ak yon kote pou nou konsilte ak ekspè yo epi dekri.
 Ekspè yo panse yon bagay ta dwe rive nan bilding lan, men jiskaprezan pa gen anyen ki rive.
 Alor pour mwan mon pa opoze avek okenn sa bann depans per se, me mon opoze avek nou sipozisyon ki sa bann depans i pridan ouswa en bon itilizasyon dolar taxpayer san ki bann eksper i dir nou.
 An reyalite, se egzakteman sa ki te pase.
 Donk mwen dakò ke nou dwe avanse, e mwen panse ke nou dwe fè sa ak yon lespri ouvè.
 Mwen sonje byen klè, jis anvan pandemi an, lè nou t ap mache nan bilding nan ak komite vizyon an oswa komite lekòl la, nou t ap tande manm komite a.
 Lè yo t ap pale ak diskite nan koulwa yo sou sa nou te kapab epi nou pa t 'kapab konsidere lekòl segondè akòz zèl syans la oswa akòz sa a oswa sa.
 Mwen ankouraje nou tout eksprime opinyon nou.
 Ak reyèlman devlope yon plan ki pèmèt nou konprann ki bezwen bilding nan pou nou ka deplase byen vit epi kòmanse reyalize kèk nan objektif sa yo.
 Dènye bagay mwen ta di se, byenke nou te diskite sou yon plan kapital, nou pa t gen yon plan kapital.
 Se konsa, ak $800,000 yo, mwen pa t 'santi kout nan pwojè, ki gen ladan yon koup nan twati bouyon.
 Ki jan yo rive isit la byen vit, ak plan kapital konplè a pa pran sa an kont.
 Alor mon krwar nou annan bokou travay pou fer dan plan kapital pou nou kapab vin en bon partener avek lezot lavil e ede fer sir ki bezwen nou distrik i ganny satisfe e ki nou pa dan en sityasyon kot nou pa kapab mentenir li.
 Nou twouve nou nan yon lòt sitiyasyon ki sanble ak yon pandemi epi nou bezwen fè anpil travay pou fè bilding yo tounen nan estanda.
 Donk, mwen defann anpil pou nou bay pwogram kapital sa a priyorite.
 Mwen pa yon enjenyè estriktirèl.
 Mon pa krwar personn dan sa komite i parey.
 Donk mon swete nou priyorite leksperyans sa ler nou pe koz lo bann progranm ki’n koute bann taxpayer dolar, e mon pa krwar nou bezwen tann plizyer lannen pour ganny sa lenformasyon.
 Mwen panse ke li trè enpòtan pou elèv yo ale la kounye a, epi yo dwe jis, franchman, ak tout elèv ki aktyèlman enskri nan Medford Public Schools, kounye a se moman an pou avanse pou pi devan ak priyorite sa a.
 Pitit mwen yo ka pa gradye nan yon lekòl ki diferan de lekòl yo ye kounye a.
 Kidonk, si nou gen chans, elèv premye ane ak klas matènèl ka gen yon opòtinite pou yo fè yon bagay diferan, men sèlman si nou pran aksyon.
 Se konsa, se nou.
 Mèsi.</p>
