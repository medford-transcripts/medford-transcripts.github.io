00:00:09,147 --> 00:00:10,528
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey listeners, this is Danielle.

00:00:10,888 --> 00:00:11,409
[SPEAKER_04]: And Shelley.

3
00:00:12,149 --> 00:00:14,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Shelley is a radical Dravidian and racial equity activist.

4
00:00:15,092 --> 00:00:17,834
[SPEAKER_00]: And Danielle is a community mobilizer and changemaker.

5
00:00:18,475 --> 00:00:20,176
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the Medford Bites podcast.

6
00:00:21,457 --> 00:00:28,363
[SPEAKER_00]: Every two weeks, we chew on the issues facing Medford and deliver bites of information about the city by lifting the expertise of our guests.

7
00:00:29,203 --> 00:00:32,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Join us in discussion about what you hope for the future of Medford.

8
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:34,728
[SPEAKER_04]: And as always, tell us where you like to eat.

9
00:00:41,863 --> 00:00:42,444
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

10
00:00:42,484 --> 00:00:44,045
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you both for being here with me tonight.

11
00:00:44,325 --> 00:00:48,930
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't mind just introducing yourself with your name and pronouns and just a bit about who you are.

12
00:00:50,211 --> 00:00:50,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

13
00:00:50,651 --> 00:00:52,693
[SPEAKER_02]: So my name is John Lewis Ntapa.

14
00:00:53,394 --> 00:00:54,775
[SPEAKER_02]: I use he him pronouns.

15
00:00:55,036 --> 00:00:58,118
[SPEAKER_02]: I am from Medford, Mass, born and raised in the North Medford Heights.

16
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:05,205
[SPEAKER_02]: I am a returning candidate from the 2019 election when I ran out of high school.

17
00:01:06,186 --> 00:01:07,027
[SPEAKER_02]: And since then,

18
00:01:08,145 --> 00:01:15,427
[SPEAKER_02]: have gone to college and graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Industrial Design with a minor in Sculpture from the Massachusetts College of Art and Design.

19
00:01:17,167 --> 00:01:31,431
[SPEAKER_02]: While at MassArt, I had a very long career, well, all four years, basically, in student leadership, student development, and student engagement, from the dorms as an RA to the student body president to the board of trustees.

20
00:01:32,571 --> 00:01:35,252
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was huge in advocation with student rights,

21
00:01:36,575 --> 00:01:39,497
[SPEAKER_02]: and making sure students had always a voice at the table.

22
00:01:41,218 --> 00:01:54,928
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm hoping, you know, the things that I was criticized for my age of 18 running back in 2019, learning all of that and having that experience has definitely shifted a lot.

23
00:01:55,529 --> 00:02:02,674
[SPEAKER_02]: And hopefully, you know, may persuade some people now that there's actual experience there.

24
00:02:03,521 --> 00:02:08,884
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really looking forward to taking those skills and those trainings and applying it to Medford if possible.

25
00:02:09,604 --> 00:02:09,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

26
00:02:09,964 --> 00:02:25,232
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's, you know, I think you bring up a good point, like 2019 was not that many years ago, but so much has happened in those few years that we'll talk about this a little bit later, sort of how, you know, it's changed maybe your approach and maybe the residents attitude towards a younger candidate.

27
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:29,334
[SPEAKER_04]: So, but first we're going to ask you that question that we ask everybody.

28
00:02:29,434 --> 00:02:33,156
[SPEAKER_04]: So what is your favorite place to eat in Medford and what do you like to eat there?

29
00:02:34,201 --> 00:02:35,222
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have a few.

30
00:02:35,682 --> 00:02:37,383
[SPEAKER_02]: So a little bit about me.

31
00:02:39,044 --> 00:02:42,646
[SPEAKER_02]: I was born and still have a severe tree nut allergy.

32
00:02:42,686 --> 00:02:45,887
[SPEAKER_02]: So finding places to trust was always hard growing up.

33
00:02:45,987 --> 00:02:49,790
[SPEAKER_02]: But I will say that it depends.

34
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:54,432
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's a night out, the Ford Tavern or Razo's is a go-to.

35
00:02:54,712 --> 00:02:56,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't beat Razo's Chicken Parm.

36
00:02:56,393 --> 00:03:00,015
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Ford, I'm still getting used to their menu as I start to go there.

37
00:03:00,075 --> 00:03:03,157
[SPEAKER_02]: But they've been great with allergies and everything.

38
00:03:03,827 --> 00:03:12,129
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm looking for a casual bite, Iris Restaurant, Noe Tejada and that crew down in Haines Square has always been phenomenal.

39
00:03:13,009 --> 00:03:17,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Back when I worked at what was then Modern Hardware, they were always very accommodating for me.

40
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:25,171
[SPEAKER_02]: And then a special shout out to Colleen's because that was the only place I could eat hard ice cream growing up and still can only eat hard ice cream.

41
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:32,633
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's like, I don't have to settle for soft serve everywhere I go, which really sucks when you're nine and out.

42
00:03:33,182 --> 00:03:37,943
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, after winning a baseball game at Gillis, it was always nice to go there.

43
00:03:37,983 --> 00:03:44,284
[SPEAKER_02]: But also shout out to those restaurants in particular, because most of them employ students from our school system.

44
00:03:45,645 --> 00:03:48,865
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they actually, you know, give our students jobs, which is really nice.

45
00:03:50,306 --> 00:03:50,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

46
00:03:50,686 --> 00:03:55,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, those are important points that we don't often hear about allergies and sort of who folks are employing.

47
00:03:55,407 --> 00:03:56,347
[SPEAKER_04]: So thanks, Sean.

48
00:03:57,247 --> 00:03:57,727
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.

49
00:03:57,767 --> 00:03:58,867
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the students.

50
00:03:58,987 --> 00:04:01,728
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm also loving the kind of historical story.

51
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,582
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe we'll jump in.

52
00:04:04,602 --> 00:04:05,062
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

53
00:04:05,222 --> 00:04:07,444
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that you came that prepared with the food question.

54
00:04:07,484 --> 00:04:09,165
[SPEAKER_00]: It is sometimes the most difficult one.

55
00:04:10,346 --> 00:04:14,789
[SPEAKER_00]: But I might circle back to some of the points you made from the beginning.

56
00:04:16,283 --> 00:04:25,446
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate you kind of beginning to reflect on the difference and kind of running straight out of high school and versus having a couple years in at this point.

57
00:04:25,946 --> 00:04:33,588
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you might talk about the pieces that led to running for the second time and maybe what's felt different, what's felt right this time.

58
00:04:33,608 --> 00:04:37,129
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, if you might just talk on those for sure.

59
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:41,630
[SPEAKER_02]: So the two joke answers but are very real.

60
00:04:42,025 --> 00:04:46,469
[SPEAKER_02]: to that question is I told myself four years ago I would, and I don't like breaking promises.

61
00:04:47,589 --> 00:04:50,852
[SPEAKER_02]: And I spent way too much money on signage to only use them once.

62
00:04:51,773 --> 00:05:05,163
[SPEAKER_02]: But also, the real answer is that I approached it from the point of view as a high school student, senior class president, someone involved in athletics and arts and knew that student perspective.

63
00:05:06,204 --> 00:05:09,587
[SPEAKER_02]: And then a lot of the criticism four years ago was, again,

64
00:05:10,374 --> 00:05:10,974
[SPEAKER_02]: experience.

65
00:05:11,174 --> 00:05:19,376
[SPEAKER_02]: It was you had only had experience in those realms and it wasn't a lot of training and it was, it was good experience, but it wasn't what people wanted.

66
00:05:20,536 --> 00:05:29,718
[SPEAKER_02]: So then when I got to college, the election ran from when I graduated to like halfway through my fall semester.

67
00:05:30,379 --> 00:05:37,120
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I lost, I tried to find opportunities because I was determined to run again on how I could

68
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:40,539
[SPEAKER_02]: get those experiences and how I could fix that.

69
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:55,547
[SPEAKER_02]: And so lucky for me, the student trustee position opened up at MassArt, which is, if people don't know, the board of trustees, student trustees, student trustees, an elected full trustee to the board of trustees by the students.

70
00:05:56,067 --> 00:05:59,309
[SPEAKER_02]: And the board of trustees is basically like the school committee of a university.

71
00:06:00,789 --> 00:06:02,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of the superintendent, it's the president.

72
00:06:03,091 --> 00:06:04,371
[SPEAKER_02]: They make sure everything's in check.

73
00:06:04,491 --> 00:06:05,592
[SPEAKER_02]: They value all that.

74
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:07,164
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a big thing.

75
00:06:07,264 --> 00:06:08,024
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a big job.

76
00:06:08,405 --> 00:06:16,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I was still in go mode and went and put my hand in the race as a first year and I got it.

77
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:18,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I was super psyched.

78
00:06:18,851 --> 00:06:19,892
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that led into.

79
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:35,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, two terms on the board and then two terms later as, um, when we got a new president, it was determined that if I had switched to SGA president, that we could build a better relationship and that would, you know, add into the leadership role.

80
00:06:36,115 --> 00:06:48,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and so basically kind of hand tailored and experience in college to not only benefit leadership and sort of amplify those skills, but also like knowing that in four years I wanted to return.

81
00:06:48,678 --> 00:06:53,820
[SPEAKER_02]: And to be honest, I tried to return two years ago, but that's when I realized I wanted to run for president there.

82
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,520
[SPEAKER_02]: And I went, I can't do both.

83
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,861
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I dropped out of the race before papers even be pulled.

84
00:06:58,881 --> 00:06:59,941
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't, wasn't even official.

85
00:07:00,601 --> 00:07:03,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it was all hearsay, but, um,

86
00:07:04,045 --> 00:07:11,290
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was those shared experiences and those initiatives that made me realize I was more prepared.

87
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:15,812
[SPEAKER_02]: I did a lot with the state and a lot of student advocacy.

88
00:07:16,053 --> 00:07:20,655
[SPEAKER_02]: And looking at platforms, there's a lot of great platforms out there between my competitors.

89
00:07:20,715 --> 00:07:21,416
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a tough race.

90
00:07:21,456 --> 00:07:31,162
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, last year was, four years ago was 10 people, but this is only eight, but it still feels more intense just because of how high level everyone's

91
00:07:32,017 --> 00:07:34,238
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, thoughts are and what they can bring to the table.

92
00:07:35,318 --> 00:07:48,363
[SPEAKER_02]: But to me, I'm, with my experience, I'm the only one that can bring the focus on student experience aspect of it, because that's where I've, that's where my experience is.

93
00:07:49,483 --> 00:08:00,227
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I decided that I wanted to run because I wanted to have someone on there that had that mindset and could think that way to make sure that we're, you know,

94
00:08:01,403 --> 00:08:10,531
[SPEAKER_02]: We're taking that into effect and that's not saying no one everyone that's that's on the minds of everyone, but it's someone that specifically hones in on that aspect would be beneficial.

95
00:08:10,832 --> 00:08:11,192
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe.

96
00:08:11,212 --> 00:08:24,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we talked to, um, uh, also Aaron who's running for school committee and also Medford and I think it came up this, like, I think over the last couple of years as we've heard more.

97
00:08:25,065 --> 00:08:26,105
[SPEAKER_04]: About, um.

98
00:08:27,343 --> 00:08:31,244
[SPEAKER_04]: some issues of violence at the high school, just sort of some of those topics.

99
00:08:31,324 --> 00:08:42,128
[SPEAKER_04]: And it sounds like adults and school committee members are maybe putting a different value on the perspective of students, like what's happening in the school currently.

100
00:08:42,148 --> 00:08:55,972
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I kind of wonder, for you having been a student relatively recently at the high school, kind of what you think, what your priorities would be for change if you were to be elected to the school committee?

101
00:08:56,946 --> 00:09:05,953
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure, so fun fact, Aaron and I actually were on the rowing team together and he actually graduated a year before me, same as Justin Sang.

102
00:09:06,693 --> 00:09:10,856
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got the class of 2018 and 2019 really in this election season.

103
00:09:11,737 --> 00:09:13,558
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, no, there definitely is a more focus.

104
00:09:13,658 --> 00:09:17,321
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will say there is also an alarming lack of focus at the same time.

105
00:09:17,521 --> 00:09:21,764
[SPEAKER_02]: When we talk about violence in the schools, we've seen, you know, that was a huge thing.

106
00:09:21,805 --> 00:09:25,807
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not really my story to tell, but,

107
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:35,023
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, there was an alarming lack of response from some of the elected officials on that and what the expectations were in our schools.

108
00:09:37,344 --> 00:09:42,146
[SPEAKER_02]: But for me, so my background is in industrial design, user experience, all of that.

109
00:09:43,687 --> 00:09:46,088
[SPEAKER_02]: No one's asking what the students want.

110
00:09:46,808 --> 00:09:50,710
[SPEAKER_02]: No one's asking what they think and what they've seen and the culture that they've lived.

111
00:09:51,831 --> 00:09:55,032
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was fighting for ALICE to be implemented four years ago,

112
00:09:55,663 --> 00:09:59,184
[SPEAKER_02]: it was because that's what everyone, that's what my peers wanted.

113
00:09:59,244 --> 00:10:00,784
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we thought was best.

114
00:10:00,844 --> 00:10:02,405
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what we had put the research into.

115
00:10:02,425 --> 00:10:19,050
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and there was a lot about, you know, not teaching, you know, not wanting students to learn how to fight or have that fear, but that experience of being in there, I can tell you that students were ready to, you know, with all the unfortunate school shootings going on, we're ready to fight or grab the nearest object at will.

116
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:22,350
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I was, um, and you don't know that unless you ask.

117
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:24,051
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and there was a, a,

118
00:10:25,248 --> 00:10:26,889
[SPEAKER_02]: alarming amount of not asking.

119
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:30,432
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've really got to make sure we're catering towards the users.

120
00:10:30,652 --> 00:10:36,436
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, when we look at users, we think of parents, we think of students, administrators, we need to make sure everything's balanced.

121
00:10:37,356 --> 00:10:44,741
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm never going to like the platform right now, as it's developing, it's pretty vague, I'll be honest, because I haven't been able to ask yet.

122
00:10:45,502 --> 00:10:53,067
[SPEAKER_02]: What aspects of this that people want, you know, do we know any mental health programs that we know that will cater towards our students better?

123
00:10:53,107 --> 00:10:54,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we know all of this?

124
00:10:55,837 --> 00:11:01,961
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I just feel like they haven't, they've been, we've been talking about what can we do for the students?

125
00:11:01,981 --> 00:11:02,882
[SPEAKER_02]: What can we do for the students?

126
00:11:02,922 --> 00:11:04,623
[SPEAKER_02]: But the question hasn't been given to students.

127
00:11:04,703 --> 00:11:12,488
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been given to parents, guardians, caregivers, and they're just as important, obviously, but we need to ask them too.

128
00:11:12,528 --> 00:11:15,630
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to know what that culture is like behind those cinder block walls.

129
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:16,291
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to know.

130
00:11:17,191 --> 00:11:18,973
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think that's still lacking.

131
00:11:18,993 --> 00:11:25,297
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that with the experience I've had serving in a role that did just that,

132
00:11:26,756 --> 00:11:30,479
[SPEAKER_02]: I can bring that to the table and hopefully make that welcoming environments.

133
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:31,360
[SPEAKER_02]: That way students.

134
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:38,606
[SPEAKER_02]: Students are not going to want to go to school if they don't feel welcomed and I want to make sure that we foster that sort of environment within the school committee.

135
00:11:38,626 --> 00:11:41,929
[SPEAKER_02]: So that way they know they can come to us and give these suggestions.

136
00:11:44,991 --> 00:11:45,911
[SPEAKER_00]: So many excellent points.

137
00:11:45,951 --> 00:11:50,193
[SPEAKER_00]: I have, like, 15 questions, and I'm trying to be organized.

138
00:11:51,314 --> 00:11:52,214
[SPEAKER_00]: Two-part, maybe.

139
00:11:52,674 --> 00:11:57,176
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love your thoughts on maybe the components of student experience.

140
00:11:57,256 --> 00:12:04,559
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I also love this discussion of power sharing and saying, like, yes, admin, teachers, students, parents, we're all stakeholders.

141
00:12:04,939 --> 00:12:11,122
[SPEAKER_00]: But to what extent can maybe older folks say, we have never been teenagers, like, in a digital age.

142
00:12:11,302 --> 00:12:14,063
[SPEAKER_00]: We have never gone to school during, like, sort of COVID

143
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:16,204
[SPEAKER_00]: touch cultural stuff.

144
00:12:18,124 --> 00:12:33,750
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe if you might talk about, and you just said it really, between Justin, yourself, Aaron, we've got really a strong showing from some younger people, talk about maybe what power shift, like upstream from like, we're not feeling heard, but what would it look like to shift weight?

145
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:36,025
[SPEAKER_00]: for power.

146
00:12:37,266 --> 00:12:44,790
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also would love your thoughts, and apologies, I'm known for way too big questions, on what education means to you, right?

147
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:53,474
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, if we're in a place where violence is a serious concern, how do we move to a place where innate investment in one's own education is what's happening in the building?

148
00:12:54,074 --> 00:12:57,116
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so many things, and thank you for putting your hand to those.

149
00:12:57,736 --> 00:12:58,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.

150
00:12:59,097 --> 00:13:00,137
[SPEAKER_02]: So, student experience.

151
00:13:02,682 --> 00:13:09,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Student experience is all about how can we set up students for their own success?

152
00:13:09,707 --> 00:13:11,869
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's sort of the approach I took at MassArt.

153
00:13:11,909 --> 00:13:22,497
[SPEAKER_02]: So, for instance, as an RA, I wasn't taking people to visits or telling them exactly where to go, but I was giving them resources and uplifting that or even.

154
00:13:23,298 --> 00:13:30,922
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, to give the example of like facilitated dialogues where two roommates can't get along, I'm not making the decision on the middle ground between the two of them.

155
00:13:31,002 --> 00:13:45,629
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's, it's all about try to guide them towards making that themselves and you get a more beneficial react, um, a more beneficial, um, Experience experience out of that.

156
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:48,511
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Jesus, how many times am I going to say experience today?

157
00:13:48,971 --> 00:13:52,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but, but it's, it's also like, kind of like how.

158
00:13:53,120 --> 00:14:01,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so I, you know, played baseball all of my, you know, younger life and then, you know, sort of, you know, had a love for it, but I didn't know if it was for me.

159
00:14:01,204 --> 00:14:06,466
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when I joined rowing, I shot off with it, um, because it was something that I had, I had made that decision.

160
00:14:07,326 --> 00:14:14,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and so student experience really, to me is all about guiding our students to making those decisions and making those choices, because in the end.

161
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,230
[SPEAKER_02]: It may take more time.

162
00:14:16,982 --> 00:14:29,531
[SPEAKER_02]: a little more effort because it's easier just to say you're just going to go play soccer for the summer you're just going to go do this but if we can find a way to get those resources out there and accessible so they know what they can pick from.

163
00:14:29,551 --> 00:14:37,376
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean that was the whole appeal of high school growing up was like oh my god I get to pick my classes I get to pick how I want this to go to me.

164
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:40,158
[SPEAKER_02]: You know in high school a lot of kids

165
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:42,369
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't like high school, they wanted to drop out.

166
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:43,869
[SPEAKER_02]: It was because like, this isn't for me.

167
00:14:43,969 --> 00:14:45,769
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not gonna use these skills.

168
00:14:45,809 --> 00:14:47,290
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not gonna benefit from this.

169
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:54,252
[SPEAKER_02]: And how can we, we use that a lot in design is how can we, so my apologies again to that statement.

170
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:57,773
[SPEAKER_02]: That will be a lot is how can we design that experience?

171
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:59,273
[SPEAKER_02]: So one, they feel welcomed.

172
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:02,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Two, we're like, no, we're here to support you.

173
00:15:03,214 --> 00:15:04,835
[SPEAKER_02]: We're here to take you through this.

174
00:15:06,711 --> 00:15:11,392
[SPEAKER_02]: but also it's extracurricular, so paying attention to the arts and athletics as well as in the classroom.

175
00:15:11,472 --> 00:15:14,732
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to make sure that they're getting to the classroom safe.

176
00:15:15,353 --> 00:15:19,853
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to make sure that when they're in our care, that it is a safe environment to learn.

177
00:15:19,893 --> 00:15:28,695
[SPEAKER_02]: And it kind of goes back to that third question of if a student doesn't feel safe in a classroom, they're only gonna be focused on how they're not feeling safe.

178
00:15:29,655 --> 00:15:31,376
[SPEAKER_02]: That was me during Parkland.

179
00:15:31,636 --> 00:15:32,896
[SPEAKER_02]: That was me during,

180
00:15:34,402 --> 00:15:44,825
[SPEAKER_02]: All of these, the school shoots that happened when I was in high school was most of my time was spent trying to figure out how I'd get out of a classroom because I didn't feel safe.

181
00:15:45,045 --> 00:15:52,507
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was, we're talking miles away from Massachusetts, miles away from Medford, but there was all this in the news and it was unsure.

182
00:15:52,587 --> 00:15:55,148
[SPEAKER_02]: And it took away from that, that, that safe environment.

183
00:15:55,228 --> 00:16:03,570
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't remember, you know, obviously I don't remember everything I learned in high school, but there were, there are pieces missing because of that anxiety of being there.

184
00:16:03,954 --> 00:16:08,317
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we're having students beat up in the hallways, we're having these things happen.

185
00:16:11,779 --> 00:16:15,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Education to me is something that someone wants to have.

186
00:16:15,482 --> 00:16:24,368
[SPEAKER_02]: We talk a lot, I just got off of a fellowship where we talked a lot about growth mindset and what that means to have a growth mindset.

187
00:16:24,388 --> 00:16:30,092
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's all about wanting to grow and to know that you may not be the best at this, but like, so what?

188
00:16:30,172 --> 00:16:31,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Not everyone's the best at everything.

189
00:16:31,933 --> 00:16:33,574
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's easier said than done.

190
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:45,108
[SPEAKER_02]: But how do we promote a culture where a student says, I'm not the best at math, but if I can't solve this equation by the beginning, but I can somehow manage to solve it by the end, then I'm satisfied.

191
00:16:45,468 --> 00:16:47,730
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to know that our students don't need to be the top.

192
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:52,754
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have to be the top at everything, because that just is an unnecessary stressor.

193
00:16:52,774 --> 00:16:54,015
[SPEAKER_02]: But if they want to be, then sure.

194
00:16:54,396 --> 00:16:55,617
[SPEAKER_02]: If they want to pursue it, sure.

195
00:16:58,153 --> 00:17:09,796
[SPEAKER_02]: We used it a lot in art school where it was like the professors were looking at if you started as someone who could paint like Van Gogh and ended like someone who could paint like Van Gogh, you failed the class because you didn't grow.

196
00:17:10,256 --> 00:17:11,096
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't learn.

197
00:17:11,256 --> 00:17:19,838
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you start the class with someone who doesn't understand 10 concepts, but you leave it understanding five, that's amazing.

198
00:17:20,158 --> 00:17:20,678
[SPEAKER_02]: Good for you.

199
00:17:20,818 --> 00:17:22,139
[SPEAKER_02]: You've gotten something out of it.

200
00:17:23,999 --> 00:17:25,139
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's sort of that.

201
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:27,900
[SPEAKER_02]: And education is where you want to learn

202
00:17:28,427 --> 00:17:29,268
[SPEAKER_02]: You're there to learn.

203
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:34,574
[SPEAKER_02]: And as it gets later on, it's more catered towards what you want.

204
00:17:34,734 --> 00:17:37,958
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think I'm talking in circles.

205
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:41,402
[SPEAKER_02]: That's essentially what it means to me, at least.

206
00:17:41,802 --> 00:17:42,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

207
00:17:42,563 --> 00:17:43,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead, Shelly.

208
00:17:47,728 --> 00:17:49,409
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you were mentioning design.

209
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:53,472
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk about when the curriculum doesn't resonate for some students, right?

210
00:17:53,532 --> 00:18:05,582
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're reading, you know, five or seven authors who are all sort of homogeneous and none of them like, you know, maybe they don't speak out to me or Common Core has never, has always made, you know, left me pulling my hair out.

211
00:18:05,702 --> 00:18:11,386
[SPEAKER_00]: Or there are four or more teachers who are so parochial that you just can't teach them anything.

212
00:18:11,446 --> 00:18:16,310
[SPEAKER_00]: And right, if we step into the classroom and believe that everyone has something to learn in every moment, then

213
00:18:17,378 --> 00:18:18,618
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, what do we do in that space?

214
00:18:20,659 --> 00:18:22,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, for sure.

215
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:34,423
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, yeah, I mean, for me, so, um, as a young attention deficit child growing up in the Medford public schools, um, if something didn't interest me, it immediately shut down.

216
00:18:35,064 --> 00:18:45,347
[SPEAKER_02]: There were moments where like, I didn't, um, there were certain classes, certain curriculum, certain things where if I didn't resonate or I couldn't find an interest in it, um, then I,

217
00:18:48,549 --> 00:18:51,992
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't, you know, provoke that curiosity.

218
00:18:52,873 --> 00:18:56,916
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a toughie because that is something that is a case-by-case basis.

219
00:18:58,197 --> 00:19:15,031
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've always found that, speaking about the teachers specifically, whenever I had those difficulties, I was able to self-advocate.

220
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:20,168
[SPEAKER_02]: which was a skill I learned pretty young as someone with, you know, a disability.

221
00:19:21,268 --> 00:19:38,511
[SPEAKER_02]: And if, you know, when the teacher was right with the subject, and I had a lot of great teachers, I was very fortunate, they were able to sort, because of their kindness and way that they helped me learn it, it proved that importance, I guess.

222
00:19:39,591 --> 00:19:42,992
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know if I have a specific answer on how we can fix it right now.

223
00:19:43,332 --> 00:19:44,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't know if I,

224
00:19:46,012 --> 00:20:06,818
[SPEAKER_02]: can think of a way to design a better experience in that sense where it's like, besides saying that we need, if we can't prove, if we can't convince the student that it should interest them, we should convince them why it's worth knowing at least in the slightest and sort of showing why, you know, sometimes things feel like busy work.

225
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:12,700
[SPEAKER_02]: So students don't want to do it, but if we can show why it isn't, we're actually building this skill, being transparent about what we're trying to do, then

226
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:16,581
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, I'm not a teacher and I'm not a trained teacher, so I don't know.

227
00:20:16,601 --> 00:20:21,905
[SPEAKER_02]: And that'd be something to talk to the MTA about skills that they've learned and skills that they've done.

228
00:20:21,925 --> 00:20:28,030
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think, too, maybe outside of skills of teachers, I think that curriculum is something maybe to think about.

229
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:34,236
[SPEAKER_04]: And I wonder, too, the first time you ran, you were just out of high school, and now you've gone through college.

230
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:38,359
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think one thing that college can be really powerful with is providing

231
00:20:41,048 --> 00:20:42,128
[SPEAKER_04]: other perspectives, right?

232
00:20:42,148 --> 00:20:49,731
[SPEAKER_04]: So we probably have more limited curriculum in metropolitan schools because we're teaching to MCAS or, you know, we're following these are the things that the students need to know.

233
00:20:50,211 --> 00:20:55,233
[SPEAKER_04]: But I found in college, like, I like the, the, the idea of like critical thinking, right?

234
00:20:55,513 --> 00:21:01,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's what my textbook says, what do I actually know about that time in history of like, what was happening and who was writing history, right?

235
00:21:01,715 --> 00:21:08,577
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think there are some big debates around like critical race theory, and like what books kids are allowed to read, right, that

236
00:21:09,037 --> 00:21:17,381
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that so I wonder like maybe how how you what you've noticed in the Met for public schools that maybe would you would think more critically about as a school committee member.

237
00:21:22,984 --> 00:21:34,909
[SPEAKER_02]: What specifically that's a great question cuz again, yeah talking about those like thinking outside of the box and those building those cultures and perspectives and finding different points of view.

238
00:21:37,263 --> 00:21:39,125
[SPEAKER_02]: There were some classes that promoted that.

239
00:21:40,266 --> 00:21:48,495
[SPEAKER_02]: There was something like, I'll take a shout out to Mr. Milne's psychology class, who also ran two years ago, Andrew Milne.

240
00:21:49,396 --> 00:21:58,485
[SPEAKER_02]: He had us really think about what our stance was and how to back it up.

241
00:21:58,785 --> 00:22:00,606
[SPEAKER_02]: and he would question us, even if he agreed with it.

242
00:22:00,626 --> 00:22:02,446
[SPEAKER_02]: And he never told us if he agreed with it or not.

243
00:22:02,466 --> 00:22:05,708
[SPEAKER_02]: That was his thing, is he was like, I will never tell you what I agree with, what I don't agree with.

244
00:22:05,748 --> 00:22:06,848
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna push you to figure that out.

245
00:22:06,868 --> 00:22:20,953
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, I had a class, sort of when you start to sort of challenge your inner dialogue, I had a class called Free Speech, Democracy, and Artists, and it was all about, and college was all about free speech and art, which is a huge topic.

246
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:28,116
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was this thing where, and MassArt is a very liberal progressive college,

247
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:36,063
[SPEAKER_02]: And the teacher specifically assigned assignments where you had to defend right-wing conservatives because of their freedom of speech.

248
00:22:36,103 --> 00:22:39,765
[SPEAKER_02]: You had to challenge what you thought was ethically correct and lawfully correct.

249
00:22:39,845 --> 00:22:48,449
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought that was like a really interesting balance of like trying to figure out how your head works and like, what does it mean by that?

250
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:56,433
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the high school, middle school and elementary school level, I think exposure, you know, exposure to the arts

251
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,541
[SPEAKER_02]: different perspectives of that sense.

252
00:22:58,601 --> 00:22:59,742
[SPEAKER_02]: What does it mean to be an artist?

253
00:22:59,762 --> 00:23:00,863
[SPEAKER_02]: What does it mean to be a designer?

254
00:23:01,804 --> 00:23:03,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Asking those questions early on.

255
00:23:03,745 --> 00:23:06,968
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish there was a more complicated exposure.

256
00:23:06,988 --> 00:23:13,293
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, complicated answer that I could give in the moment besides exposure is the biggest thing we can do is showing what's out there in the world.

257
00:23:14,454 --> 00:23:22,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Showing out, you know, what we can do and finding an age appropriate level is also something that I know nothing about and would need to consult with people about.

258
00:23:22,981 --> 00:23:25,643
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to pretend like I know when to introduce certain topics.

259
00:23:26,308 --> 00:23:31,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but there are topics that need to be introduced that aren't introduced mental health, which was on the platform four years ago.

260
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:34,510
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see any development with that.

261
00:23:34,851 --> 00:23:36,431
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, cause we're not even talking about it.

262
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:39,852
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not talking about all these stressful things and I hate to say it, but.

263
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:44,993
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, in a very interesting way to say our kids are going through it.

264
00:23:45,394 --> 00:23:49,055
[SPEAKER_02]: They are, especially during the pandemic, they were going through a pre pandemic.

265
00:23:49,335 --> 00:23:50,575
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw it firsthand.

266
00:23:50,635 --> 00:23:51,435
[SPEAKER_02]: I've dealt with them.

267
00:23:52,336 --> 00:23:53,416
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and.

268
00:23:53,842 --> 00:23:57,225
[SPEAKER_02]: we needed to find a way to show that it was okay to not be okay.

269
00:23:57,285 --> 00:24:00,928
[SPEAKER_02]: And that, even that mindset wasn't even alive in the schools.

270
00:24:01,768 --> 00:24:05,091
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's like a whole rehaul of what that experience is.

271
00:24:05,111 --> 00:24:22,564
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think I might be straying from the question a little too much, but I would say that what I noticed the most was it was Medford High was really starting to improve with the cultural clubs that were starting up and, you know, getting stronger, Asian clubs spreading, you know, you know, the culture and,

272
00:24:23,538 --> 00:24:28,661
[SPEAKER_02]: There were a lot of great fairs that sort of we're able to get a glimpse of things into.

273
00:24:29,182 --> 00:24:34,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes I feel like when we don't understand something, it's because we haven't even gotten a small glimpse of what that might be.

274
00:24:34,865 --> 00:24:42,410
[SPEAKER_02]: And if there's a way to expose that, like I had no clue what rowing was and it ended up being my high school sport.

275
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:44,792
[SPEAKER_02]: It was because one, my music teacher, Ms.

276
00:24:44,852 --> 00:24:48,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Grant said, Hey, there's a middle school program starting up.

277
00:24:48,454 --> 00:24:49,735
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really cool to watch.

278
00:24:49,775 --> 00:24:51,296
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, she thinks that's cool.

279
00:24:51,878 --> 00:24:52,799
[SPEAKER_02]: why don't I check it out?

280
00:24:52,879 --> 00:24:57,002
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it was my whole thing from, you know, seventh to when I graduated.

281
00:24:57,722 --> 00:25:10,892
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so I hate to say, I feel like I've strayed from the question, but I don't know if I have a proper answer besides exposure and, um, I guess letting people explore and trying to see what, you know, what we can do.

282
00:25:10,932 --> 00:25:18,298
[SPEAKER_02]: If people, you know, want to explore what it means, you know, what their mental health is, and we need to find the resources to do that safely and to make sure that we know what that means.

283
00:25:18,338 --> 00:25:21,100
[SPEAKER_02]: If they want to start thinking more critically, or if they want to start,

284
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:26,486
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, looking at these, these, um, phenomenas that you've mentioned earlier, like we need to see, right.

285
00:25:26,947 --> 00:25:33,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have the, we can talk about these things and these things should be talked about, but do we have the expertise to make sure it's done appropriately?

286
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:42,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's one thing to talk about something, but if you don't have the people that actually know what they're talking about, you can do more damage than, than good essentially.

287
00:25:42,991 --> 00:25:48,853
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need to make sure that it's, it's done introduced correctly and guided appropriately.

288
00:25:50,367 --> 00:25:50,767
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.

289
00:25:50,807 --> 00:25:56,850
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are profound goals, although I might say it is a student's responsibility to invest in their own learning.

290
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:59,031
[SPEAKER_00]: It's less of a question than if you want to.

291
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:00,812
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's just me.

292
00:26:03,073 --> 00:26:11,497
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like you're bringing up so many salient points and I'm wondering if you have visioning around, you know, the presumption that you do get elected and

293
00:26:12,945 --> 00:26:15,027
[SPEAKER_00]: What does your role bring to school committee?

294
00:26:15,087 --> 00:26:18,129
[SPEAKER_00]: And where might you leave Medford sort of on the other side?

295
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:21,371
[SPEAKER_00]: What does best practice feel like?

296
00:26:21,391 --> 00:26:25,915
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, what's that one piece that we say, you know, John came, came with it.

297
00:26:26,055 --> 00:26:29,277
[SPEAKER_00]: He, you know, gifted the city with these one or two thoughts.

298
00:26:31,019 --> 00:26:39,045
[SPEAKER_00]: And then maybe if you have any fancy events or, you know, kickoff campaign stuff that we can all come through and support, let us know.

299
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:40,566
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.

300
00:26:43,334 --> 00:26:54,162
[SPEAKER_03]: geez, if I got on, or when I get on, we'll say like that, what would the legacy sort of be?

301
00:26:54,182 --> 00:26:55,863
[SPEAKER_00]: Or sorry, where does the work begin?

302
00:26:56,063 --> 00:26:59,426
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe because two years is an interesting amount of time.

303
00:27:03,108 --> 00:27:05,510
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what, let's put it like this.

304
00:27:06,591 --> 00:27:07,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Say I get elected.

305
00:27:08,512 --> 00:27:09,433
[SPEAKER_02]: I serve two years.

306
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:13,017
[SPEAKER_02]: And then either life happens or whatever, and I can't do it again.

307
00:27:13,177 --> 00:27:16,300
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was like, what did he do in two years that was worth something?

308
00:27:18,561 --> 00:27:20,383
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm all about building foundation.

309
00:27:20,703 --> 00:27:23,245
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my biggest thing, is how can we do the research?

310
00:27:23,285 --> 00:27:31,571
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what my role is, is before any product goes on the market, my role is to build that foundation for the engineers to take it and run with it.

311
00:27:32,231 --> 00:27:33,693
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'd say for me,

312
00:27:36,048 --> 00:27:41,731
[SPEAKER_02]: getting the conversation started, which we kind of did four years ago, but they've died off for obvious reasons.

313
00:27:41,771 --> 00:27:49,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Some other things, large things came up, a global pandemic, a pandemic hit, and a lot of focus shifted towards that.

314
00:27:52,137 --> 00:28:02,403
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would say building the foundation of really

315
00:28:03,469 --> 00:28:13,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Letting our students know it's okay to invest in the arts and what those benefits are without, you know, looking at a on a. On a less surface level, um.

316
00:28:14,613 --> 00:28:19,475
[SPEAKER_02]: What mental health is and how it can show itself at very different ages.

317
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:27,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and how the best, the more we know about it, the better and also the more we talk about it, the less of the stigma that there is.

318
00:28:29,098 --> 00:28:29,218
[SPEAKER_02]: Um.

319
00:28:30,659 --> 00:28:34,562
[SPEAKER_02]: as well as building a foundation for our students to build a foundation.

320
00:28:34,682 --> 00:28:37,524
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the words, the key phrases within the campaign is interdependence.

321
00:28:38,605 --> 00:28:48,533
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause we want to, you know, give these skills to our students, but to build that vibrant community, they need to work with themselves and figure out, you know, how that works.

322
00:28:48,593 --> 00:28:54,177
[SPEAKER_02]: Different cultures come and go at least every four years within the buildings.

323
00:28:55,978 --> 00:28:58,020
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'd say that if, if,

324
00:28:59,093 --> 00:29:04,435
[SPEAKER_02]: we can take these high level skills and things that we can apply to the school committee to work better together.

325
00:29:05,095 --> 00:29:14,138
[SPEAKER_02]: But then the students look at that and look at us and go, okay, maybe we can figure out a way to, you know, build a better environment in our classrooms, you know, ourselves.

326
00:29:15,178 --> 00:29:27,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I think that'd be a beautiful, a very beautiful thing, um, just to spread more kindness and more, um, acceptance for some things that maybe seem taboo, like someone wanting to be an artist when they grow up and, um, or someone,

327
00:29:27,879 --> 00:29:32,102
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, who has a bad day, but can't figure out why, you know, sometimes it just happens.

328
00:29:35,984 --> 00:29:52,034
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, or, you know, I, you know, someone is a extreme theater geek, but they find a home in a rundown boatyard, things like that, where it's like, we can make it so that way our students are sustaining themselves as well.

329
00:29:52,595 --> 00:29:54,996
[SPEAKER_02]: We should be sustaining them, we should be building that safety net,

330
00:29:56,550 --> 00:30:00,113
[SPEAKER_02]: the more we can help them do that now, the more successful they'll be later on.

331
00:30:00,133 --> 00:30:06,879
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why also the campaign's really investing its time into the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility, the CCSR.

332
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:09,282
[SPEAKER_02]: I was one of the members of that in high school.

333
00:30:10,523 --> 00:30:18,951
[SPEAKER_02]: My project became one of the city's free little libraries and investing in that program and bringing that more attention.

334
00:30:18,991 --> 00:30:21,593
[SPEAKER_02]: It receives funding from the Cummings Foundation, but

335
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:26,752
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to pivot it so that the city invests in it more and really looks at what we're doing.

336
00:30:26,772 --> 00:30:33,475
[SPEAKER_02]: If we can start this, these leadership skills where it's a little more hands-on in the elementary school and maybe middle school level.

337
00:30:33,495 --> 00:30:35,256
[SPEAKER_02]: But once you get to high school, it's hands off.

338
00:30:36,116 --> 00:30:39,738
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very much like you're figuring this out, you know, throw them in the deep end.

339
00:30:39,758 --> 00:30:40,958
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see what's what happens.

340
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:45,860
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's working, it's building culture and collaboration.

341
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:52,003
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's all these keywords again, that we're throwing out there, but looking hypothetically at that kind of stuff.

342
00:30:53,042 --> 00:30:59,366
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I don't know, I think just even starting conversations and starting to build and laying foundational groundwork.

343
00:31:00,086 --> 00:31:00,746
[SPEAKER_02]: So that way.

344
00:31:01,387 --> 00:31:08,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Times change, um, you know, we've remodeled houses all the times, but if we have strong, we can't do it unless we have a strong foundation.

345
00:31:09,571 --> 00:31:14,714
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and so that is something that I would love to do and hope to bring and also just bring students to the table.

346
00:31:14,754 --> 00:31:20,778
[SPEAKER_02]: The only way students have a seat at the table is that one high school senior or the two high school seniors that sit off to the end that don't have a voting, right.

347
00:31:20,838 --> 00:31:21,578
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, they go.

348
00:31:22,356 --> 00:31:23,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, what's going on there?

349
00:31:23,417 --> 00:31:25,638
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they kind of voice that.

350
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:33,724
[SPEAKER_02]: And then to sort of end that thought and put the last part of the question, we've rescheduled the kickoff.

351
00:31:33,784 --> 00:31:37,347
[SPEAKER_02]: The kickoff will be October 8th at 11 a.m.

352
00:31:37,947 --> 00:31:40,910
[SPEAKER_02]: at the American Legion Post 45.

353
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:44,332
[SPEAKER_02]: It won't be too long.

354
00:31:44,352 --> 00:31:46,614
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be a great time to sort of raise funds.

355
00:31:46,694 --> 00:31:49,956
[SPEAKER_02]: We're later on in the month, but that's okay, because we still have funds left over.

356
00:31:49,976 --> 00:31:50,897
[SPEAKER_02]: We still have a lot of signs.

357
00:31:51,636 --> 00:31:53,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but really, we also want to give back to the community.

358
00:31:54,037 --> 00:32:01,322
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of the funds that we will raise will also be donated to, um, if, if groups like the, the orchestra and band reach out, we want to be able to.

359
00:32:01,542 --> 00:32:03,903
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, help fund those projects.

360
00:32:03,923 --> 00:32:10,407
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's also, you know, getting, getting in a part of it is getting literacy out and getting signs out, but it also is investing in our community.

361
00:32:10,467 --> 00:32:13,508
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, any, any and all donations are great.

362
00:32:13,949 --> 00:32:15,410
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we don't have an act blue.

363
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:19,712
[SPEAKER_02]: We, um, use PayPal and we also have people just sending checks to the house essentially.

364
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:22,707
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can find out more about that on my website.

365
00:32:23,407 --> 00:32:23,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

366
00:32:23,587 --> 00:32:24,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you tell us what your website is?

367
00:32:25,489 --> 00:32:25,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

368
00:32:25,769 --> 00:32:28,951
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Antapa4Medford.com.

369
00:32:30,272 --> 00:32:35,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Facebook is also Antapa4Medford.com.

370
00:32:35,576 --> 00:32:42,702
[SPEAKER_02]: Instagram is Antapa4Medford.com because they said I was impersonating myself.

371
00:32:42,742 --> 00:32:44,623
[SPEAKER_02]: So they banned Antapa4Medford.

372
00:32:45,695 --> 00:32:47,857
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had to make another one.

373
00:32:48,757 --> 00:32:51,759
[SPEAKER_02]: They said, you're impersonating this 19 year old kid running for office.

374
00:32:51,799 --> 00:32:52,760
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, ah, you got me.

375
00:32:54,301 --> 00:32:55,322
[SPEAKER_02]: So I stopped fighting them.

376
00:32:56,803 --> 00:32:58,123
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can find out stuff about that.

377
00:32:58,143 --> 00:33:06,269
[SPEAKER_02]: The campaign's changing as we talk again to that user experience and to see what people are looking at, what people want to get out of this kind of thing.

378
00:33:06,289 --> 00:33:11,932
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, building the foundations of JEDI principles, justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion.

379
00:33:13,895 --> 00:33:33,440
[SPEAKER_02]: building on the principles of open educational resources where students don't really have to buy textbooks, but if they want to get extra stuff and want to keep investing in their own future, how can we set up systems and introduce them to those early on that really benefit higher ed and how to prep them for life?

380
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:39,741
[SPEAKER_02]: I learned how to write a check by making this committee.

381
00:33:40,141 --> 00:33:42,142
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I learned how to write a check was by

382
00:33:43,737 --> 00:33:44,578
[SPEAKER_02]: starting the campaign.

383
00:33:45,498 --> 00:33:54,825
[SPEAKER_02]: And so investing more in the involvement fair, the job involvement fair, and those sort of small fundamentals that we may overlook as well.

384
00:33:54,965 --> 00:33:58,167
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think I've talked for long enough about that question.

385
00:33:58,608 --> 00:33:59,628
[SPEAKER_04]: We appreciate it.

386
00:34:00,309 --> 00:34:00,829
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.

387
00:34:00,869 --> 00:34:04,572
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you know that Toni Morrison says, in times of pain, the artists go to work.

388
00:34:05,092 --> 00:34:06,633
[SPEAKER_00]: So that might be a space to start.

389
00:34:07,434 --> 00:34:07,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

390
00:34:07,854 --> 00:34:08,775
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.

391
00:34:09,638 --> 00:34:10,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

392
00:34:10,378 --> 00:34:11,638
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I really appreciate it.

393
00:34:11,658 --> 00:34:14,559
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate this opportunity to and what you guys do.

394
