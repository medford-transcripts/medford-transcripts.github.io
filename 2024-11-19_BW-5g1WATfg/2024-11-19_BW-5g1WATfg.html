    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=30.288s">Mr.</a>  President, move suspension of the rules, Mr. President, to take paper 21-571. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=36.653s">And</a>  after that, Mr. President, to take public participation out of order.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=43.039s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=44.74s">21-571,</a>  I'll put on the suspension by President Caraviello, Vice President Knight, Council Beas, Council Falco, Council Marks, and Councilor Morocco. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=55.169s">Be</a>  it resolved that the Medford City Council <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=57.368s">offered</a>  steepest and sincere condolences to the family of Lillie Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=61.572s">We</a>  have further resolved that the Medford City Council dedicate tonight's meeting in her honor. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=66.115s">For</a>  those who don't know, Lillie Scarpelli was our colleague, Councilor George Scarpelli's mother. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=70.779s">So</a>  if we could stand and have a moment of silence for her, it would be appreciated. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=87.092s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=94.677s">Councilor</a>  Marks, you want to take public participation next? <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=98.039s">Please,</a>  Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=99.62s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Marks to take public participation under suspension.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=104.383s">Mr.</a>  President, if we could. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=106.64s">There</a>  is several petitions before us, all of similar subject matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=113.362s">I</a>  would ask that we take them all together, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=115.663s">You</a>  read it once and we'll take them all together and allow the petitioners to come up and speak.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=119.604s">So</a>  on the motion to take public participation out of order, by Councilor Marks, seconded by? <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=128.066s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=129.407s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=131.307s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=132.068s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=132.448s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=137.0s">Five</a>  in favor, one opposed, motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=142.144s">Public</a>  participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=145.506s">I</a>  won't read all the names all at once, but I'll read the first part of the paragraph. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=154.733s">The</a>  racist method website. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=157.14s">be</a>  added to the next council agenda, a discussion regarding the anonymously posted website to include the impact on those targeted in the response or lack of thereof by the city administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=172.532s">So</a>  before we get started on this, <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=176.999s">I</a>  want to let everybody know that this is an ongoing police matter and investigation, and it is also with the Middlesex County District Attorney's Office. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=187.268s">So</a>  we will not discuss anything regarding that. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=193.594s">Also,</a>  the Medford City Council has no authority to take down any website or anything further like that either. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=204.462s">If</a>  you want to speak, please speak and do not bring up the investigation or the city's ability to take down the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=218.143s">Councilor</a>  Raults.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=219.104s">If</a>  I could just go on record as just noting that I think using this body as a forum for civil and legal matters that are ongoing that the council has no jurisdiction over and no involvement with only further confuses the public about the duties of this actual body, which are clearly stated in the city charter, Massachusetts general laws and the open meeting law. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=240.419s">So</a>  I just want to go on record as saying that.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=242.48s">If</a>  you can make a motion, you put that in the form of a motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=247.07s">I</a>  just want to go on record with that.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=248.932s">I</a>  just want to go on record. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=249.933s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=250.314s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=250.974s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=252.095s">So,</a>  um, public participation, who would like to be first? <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=256.66s">And</a>  again, please, please be courteous. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=258.502s">Please</a>  don't mention people's names either. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=260.685s">I</a>  appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=261.305s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=261.586s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=262.367s">Name</a>  and address of the record.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=263.868s">My</a>  name is Susan Panter and I live at zero summit road. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=268.265s">I</a>  want to thank you all for allowing me this time to talk to you about the website, how racist Medford and the negative effect it has had on me. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=276.826s">I</a>  apologize for reading my thoughts, but I want to make sure that my thoughts are clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=283.408s">Last</a>  year, I received a text message from a neighborhood friend asking if I was aware that my name was on a website called the 18 Most Racist People in Medford, posted by an anonymous person. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=297.408s">Needless</a>  to say, after checking it out, I was pretty upset. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=301.933s">I</a>  received phone calls from friends and family that viewed the website and expressed concern for me and the other people identified by the Race of Medford group. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=313.888s">Apparently</a>  my being called a racist stemmed from an open letter I posted about the mayors not attending the police rally held at City Hall in July 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=325.991s">I</a>  mentioned that she attended the BLM rally the week before and spoke about systemic racism, equity, and policing in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=334.975s">I</a>  did not protest that rally, nor did I speak out against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=339.797s">I</a>  believe they had every right to peacefully express their views. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=343.939s">But</a>  I was disappointed that the mayor and or the chief didn't appear at the rally because I viewed it as an opportunity for the city to listen and show support for both sides of the issues facing Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=358.071s">Personally,</a>  I do believe that Black lives and voices matter, but I also believe that the BLM organization itself causes more racial tension and divisiveness than inclusivity. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=372.179s">Like</a>  the people at the BLM rally, I believe I had every right to express my disappointment, and I even attached my name to my comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=381.824s">I</a>  attended the police rally. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=383.822s">The</a>  rally was peaceful until the BLM protesters standing directly behind us started yelling out comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=392.868s">One</a>  young lady from the BLM group jumped up onto the stone wall in front of City Hall and began to yell things at the crowd. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=401.434s">I</a>  chose to leave at that point, but I thought a lot about what went on that day. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=406.607s">As</a>  a little girl, I was always taught to be kind and respectful of all. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=410.73s">I</a>  also learned that other people's opinions matter, even when they differ from mine, and not to judge people before you know them. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=418.976s">I</a>  even wrote a children's book about judging people that is currently on Amazon and Barnes and Noble. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=426.122s">After</a>  the racist of Medford website was posted, negative comments were made on my book's review section, saying I was not inclusive and I was, <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=436.465s">and</a>  quite a hypocrite. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=438.745s">Sales</a>  of the book slowed down after those comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=442.326s">The</a>  person who wrote the negative comments used a web name, Promising Actress, rather than attach a real name to their comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=450.768s">I</a>  also attended a wedding in New Hampshire and was called out by a person also attending that had seen the website and said to me that they didn't know racists were invited. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=462.28s">Joking</a>  or not, it was an upsetting circumstance as I was not familiar with the person. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=468.044s">In</a>  my entire 24-year career as an elementary teacher, I never once had a blemish or accusation made against me. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=477.129s">I</a>  treated all my students and parents with the respect they deserved no matter their race, color, religion, or gender. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=487.087s">I</a>  believe that all people have a right to their opinion without being chastised for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=492.849s">However,</a>  they should have the courage to state their name and say it out loud so that people being accused of something can justify their position. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=502.992s">The</a>  people behind the racist of Medford website continue to hide behind social media walls to intimidate and make accusations against people they know nothing about. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=515.18s">To</a>  me, they are cowards and should be addressed as such. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=519.302s">When</a>  the public reads those comments, do they also misjudge who you are and what you stand for? <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=527.165s">Why</a>  are the website creators afraid to identify themselves? <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=531.427s">This</a>  website further encourages racial tension, intimidation, and divisiveness. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=538.252s">In</a>  life, there will always be those who, because of their behavior, ruin the reputation of the whole group they work with or associate with. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=547.276s">One</a>  bad teacher makes the rest become under suspicion. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=552.198s">One</a>  police officer's inexcusable behavior makes the whole force become labeled and put under the microscope. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=560.998s">One</a>  protester's destructive act makes all protesting groups worrisome. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=568.445s">Until</a>  we stop labeling all because of a few, we continue pitting one group against another, unrest, tension, and barriers between all people will continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=582.09s">Mayor</a>  Breanna Lungo-Koehn had stated, hate speech, threatening behavior, or intimidation tactics have no place here and never will. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=591.654s">And</a>  I agree with her, but I don't understand how she hasn't applied that same rule against the hate-filled and threatening tactics of this website, Racist of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=603.499s">How</a>  can she make that statement and not condemn this anonymous group's message? <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=608.482s">Let</a>  me be clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=610.159s">I</a>  care about all human beings. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=612.606s">I</a>  love this city of Medved, and I'm concerned about where it's headed. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=618.34s">Following</a>  the rules of this council, I would ask that a council member put the following motion on next week's agenda to vote the following, that the Medford City Council vote to condemn the racism Medford organization social media page, and that the May's July 15th, 2020 statement of the rally at city hall posted on the city webpage be removed. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=643.012s">I</a>  respectfully submit this, I'm Susan Penta, and I would like to have this document included as part of the official notes of tonight's meeting.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=651.197s">Thank</a>  you, Mrs. Penta.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=655.02s">Thank</a>  you for listening.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=669.709s">Good</a>  evening, name and address to the record, please.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=672.928s">John</a>  Petrala, 61 Locust Street, Method Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=677.41s">Good</a>  evening, Mr. President, good evening, councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=684.593s">I'm</a>  just gonna go right into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=687.614s">Because</a>  of the mayor's response to a police rally and the creators of the Racist of Method website, my family and I, <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=699.57s">were</a>  the recipients of disgusting phone calls, harassment, and threats. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=706.672s">No</a>  one should have to endure the injustice and vile accusations that were made against my family and myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=720.935s">I</a>  am sure that none of you would want your name insulted or have any harm come to your family. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=727.816s">It's</a>  not easy to answer your spouse or children. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=731.618s">Why</a>  are they doing this to us? <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=735.561s">My</a>  only response was this is a politically motivated attack. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=740.644s">It</a>  was done under false pretense by unethical people. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=749.985s">I</a>  respectfully request that a vote be taken to have the mayor's response to the police rally be taken down from the methodmass.org website immediately.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=785.681s">I</a>  don't believe it's a Facebook post.</p>

<a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1284.559s">I</a>  go, what? <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1285.899s">There's</a>  a racist of Medford website? <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1288.581s">Are</a>  you kidding me? <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1289.401s">Who</a>  would do such a thing? <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1293.182s">It</a>  appears that the, <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1297.286s">comments</a>  of the mayor have spawned that website as the comments that are on the city's website also exist on the front page of that racist metric website. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1311.999s">Quite</a>  interesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1313.601s">Personally,</a>  to be called a Nazi when my relatives are <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1321.788s">were</a>  caught in the Holocaust is quite offensive to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1326.214s">I've</a>  lost sleep at nights. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1328.437s">I've</a>  lost customers over this. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1331.362s">And</a>  I've had people calling me about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1333.845s">It's,</a>  it's, <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1336.105s">travesty</a>  of justice and to have my words taken that said I do not believe in white entitlement because I believe that people of all ethnicities and races can make it here in the USA. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1349.795s">It's</a>  a matter of choices. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1352.437s">If</a>  they choose to commit a crime, that's their choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1355.879s">If</a>  they choose to get a great job and do well for themselves, that's a choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1361.531s">And</a>  this whole website has spawned more racism in the city than I can even begin to think of. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1369.515s">And</a>  I think it's a travesty of justice that the mayor put up a statement that blames the adults for the language that was being spoken by the sweet little BLM youth. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1383.961s">And</a>  a demand that that be taken off the, <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1388.023s">city</a>  website, and I guess we'll have to deal with the racist of Medford website through other sources, but let it be known that this trashes people, this website. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1404.27s">It</a>  causes racism, divide, and hatred. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1407.491s">It's</a>  libel and slander and serves as a threat to anybody that disagrees in their way of thinking and this attempt to harm both us <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1416.97s">All</a>  of us who are on there, personally and professionally, this has to cease. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1422.274s">And</a>  all those who have put up this website, added to it, made it viable, promoted, share it, need to be held accountable, and need to remove it from the worldwide web. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1433.623s">I</a>  know that's not your jurisdiction, but I have to speak my piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1438.187s">And</a>  I want to thank you for the opportunity to allow me to speak my piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1442.07s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1442.85s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

<a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1531.815s">I</a>  go back to my first point. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1534.358s">Who</a>  wants to chance being labeled a racist or an anti-anti-racist and find themselves, as these people have, on a website, charged, tried, and convicted by an anonymous individual or individuals too cowardly to put their name or names <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1556.77s">to</a>  this disgrace and explain why they have the moral authority to judge others. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1563.295s">It</a>  is the opposite of what we're all striving for, which is to stop prejudging, stereotyping, bullying, and intolerant behavior. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1573.222s">I'm</a>  not here to criticize the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1575.965s">I'm</a>  here to ask you to condemn this website, its anonymous creator, and in a loud voice say, we will not tolerate this in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1585.952s">Remaining</a>  silent in the hope that no one would see this site is not an answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1591.354s">The</a>  internet has become another form of reference for prospective employers, clients, financial institutions, and many more. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1601.156s">One</a>  need only Google someone's name. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1604.373s">Silence</a>  will not make it go away either. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1606.655s">It</a>  is now in its third publication. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1610.898s">I</a>  believe it's up to 30 people who have been named. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1615.382s">I'm</a>  sure there's a chance for me coming up shortly, hopefully not. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1620.186s">Right</a>  now, by the grace of God, I'm not on that website. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1623.989s">Saying</a>  it's out of our realm, it's not our bailiwick to do anything is not an answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1630.074s">You</a>  can do something. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1632.528s">Condemn</a>  this site and its progeny. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1635.89s">Your</a>  condemnation will speak volumes. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1639.192s">Request</a>  that the mayor's statement that has been used on this website be removed from the city's official website so as not to give credence to this hateful site. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1648.657s">And</a>  I take into, Mr. President, I'll take your commentary and heed it with regard to getting in touch with the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1657.923s">Someone</a>  once famously said, <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1660.574s">Where</a>  do I go to get my reputation back? <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1663.796s">I</a>  suggest that the first step in your capacity as publicly elected officials is to speak out against this anonymous and defamatory website. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1675.224s">And</a>  it's not just the individuals on this site who have been smeared. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1679.547s">The</a>  entire city, all of us, have been labeled as a, quote, deeply racist city, unquote. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1686.952s">That</a>  excludes no one. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1689.894s">no</a>  one in this room, no one in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1693.296s">Perhaps</a>  the cynical individual or individuals believe Medford has become fertile ground for this behavior of anonymously shaming, condemning, and marginalizing those with whom they disagree, and that it is now acceptable to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1709.423s">I</a>  would hope you agree that it is not, nor has it ever been. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1713.986s">Do</a>  not allow this cowardly act and behavior to find a home here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1719.288s">condemn</a>  it loudly and in unison. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1722.33s">Thank</a>  you for listening to me.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1723.931s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. DeAntonio. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1729.594s">Any</a>  further discussion?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1730.855s">Motion</a>  to revert to the regular order of business.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1734.957s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1736.238s">And</a>  I would like to take this opportunity to thank the speakers, Mr. President, who took the time to come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1748.763s">And</a>  also, Mr. President, the time to relay the story of what they've been through over the past year. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1759.05s">That's</a>  not an easy thing, Mr. President, especially in this day and age. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1763.953s">And</a>  this council has gone on record on a number of occasions denouncing different issues within this community and sending a message, even on issues we have no authority on. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1779.779s">sending</a>  a message if we felt strongly enough, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1784.041s">And</a>  I truly believe that this is one of those issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1791.345s">My</a>  opinion, Mr. President, when you have an anonymous site, as was stated by the speakers, you have a site that you can't refer to anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1801.85s">There's</a>  no contact. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1804.571s">All</a>  it is, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1807.002s">is</a>  a hate-filled site, a site used to bully, Mr. President, to defame, to slander, to maliciously misrepresent good people in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1824.293s">And</a>  I think everyone has to stand behind this and say, we're not going to tolerate it, whether it's this issue, Mr. President, or the issue we had last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1836.051s">We</a>  had a petition that come before us, a Method resident, an artist that put up a banner that was approved and commissioned by the parks department to put up the banner and the banners were ripped down, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1852.366s">And</a>  every member of this council was outraged because the banner was taken down, Mr. President and ripped down, outraged. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1863.895s">And</a>  I would hope that outrage, Mr. President, continues and carries on, because now we're not dealing with a bayonet. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1871.962s">We're</a>  dealing with human beings. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1874.304s">We're</a>  dealing with lives, families, businesses of people in our community, long-respected people in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1885.993s">So</a>  I would hope that same outrage that I had last week <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1889.669s">continues</a>  this week, Mr. President, because hate is hate no matter where it is, no matter who it happens to. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1898.354s">It's</a>  hate, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1900.416s">And</a>  that can't be tolerated. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1909.041s">We</a>  have a policy, Mr. President, about cyberbullying within our schools, here within the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1917.715s">I</a>  can't think of any better example of cyberbullying than the Method racist site. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1924.799s">That's</a>  cyberbullying, and I'm glad it's being investigated by the Method police, as you stated, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1930.802s">I'm</a>  glad it's being investigated on the state level as well, because that site immediately needs to be taken down, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1940.106s">And</a>  I have no problem, and I'd like to do it in the form of two motions. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1944.642s">because</a>  I respect my colleagues for saying that maybe part of the original motion that was recommended by some of the public was not under our bailiwick and it involves the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1957.39s">And</a>  I respect that. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1958.771s">So</a>  I would respectfully ask Mr. President that we break it into two forms of resolutions and motions. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1965.455s">The</a>  first one being, <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1967.262s">And</a>  it's a little different wording than the petitioner offered, but I'm willing to look at that language as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1973.827s">But</a>  I would like to offer Mr. President, the motion that be it resolved that the method city council denounce the anonymous hate filled website, racist of method for its defamation, slander, <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=1996.147s">malicious</a>  misrepresentation, and abusive attack on the character, reputation, and good name of Method residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2011.877s">That</a>  would be the first motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2014.598s">I</a>  do have it written down, Mr. Clerk, and I will get it to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2018.061s">Well,</a>  let me just offer the second one, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2020.182s">The</a>  reason why I split it is because I believe everyone behind this reeling <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2026.488s">wants</a>  to stamp out hatred and racism. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2029.55s">I</a>  believe that, Mr. President, strongly, with all my heart. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2034.333s">And</a>  I believe that first motion does this. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2038.496s">Second</a>  motion is be it resolved that the mayor's response to the police rally be taken down from the City of Methods website. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2048.122s">That</a>  would be the second one, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2052.192s">and</a>  members could decide on their own whether we want to just send a statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2056.313s">And</a>  again, it's up to the mayor if she wants to take that down, if we want to send a statement or not, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2061.534s">But</a>  that way, we divide both. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2063.715s">I</a>  want to thank the speakers for coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2067.136s">You</a>  know, when I ran for public office, Mr. President, I ran to fix sidewalks, lower taxes, help our seniors, affordable housing, <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2080.6s">You</a>  know, the basic city of Medford issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2085.263s">And</a>  now we seem to be getting in to a lot of other issues, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2091.027s">And</a>  so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2092.669s">I</a>  change with the times. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2094.09s">I</a>  move with the flow. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2096.972s">But</a>  as I stated last week, let's get back to the business at hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2101.215s">We</a>  have a lot of important items on our table, Mr. President, that we need to move forward on. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2107.105s">And</a>  I think, unfortunately, we're spending a lot of time on issues, as my colleague stated, that really don't involve this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2117.569s">But</a>  then again, we are the only sounding board in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2120.65s">Where</a>  else do you go? <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2122.551s">I</a>  guess you can get your soapbox and go in front of Colleen's, but where else do you go in the community? <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2130.283s">This</a>  has always been the people's forum, as former President Mayorkas would say. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2134.344s">This</a>  was the people's forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2136.345s">And</a>  whether we like what's being said or not, public participation allows people to get up and air and vent, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2145.647s">And</a>  it's our obligation and duty to listen and, if be, react. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2151.529s">And</a>  I think this is one of the moments where we have to react and denounce. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2155.67s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2156.65s">Go.</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2158.293s">Councilor</a>  Marks has two motions on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2161.755s">We'll</a>  take the first one first. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2163.175s">So</a>  the first motion by Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2165.116s">Mr.</a>  President, I believe those motions should go on the agenda for next week.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2170.018s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2170.658s">We</a>  are on the suspension, Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2172.819s">No,</a>  it was on the agenda, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/BW-5g1WATfg&t=2175.42s">I</a>  guess it was taken out of order, but it's on the agenda.</p>
