[SPEAKER_13]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America.

00:00:30,288 --> 00:00:36,033
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, move suspension of the rules, Mr. President, to take paper 21-571.

20
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:44,720
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

[SPEAKER_13]: 21-571, I'll put on the suspension by President Carabiello, Vice President Knight, Council Beas, Council Falco, Council Marks, and Councilor Morocco.

22
00:00:55,169 --> 00:00:56,850
[SPEAKER_13]: Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council

23
00:00:57,368 --> 00:01:01,011
[SPEAKER_13]: offered steepest and sincere condolences to the family of Lillie Scott Pelley.

24
00:01:01,572 --> 00:01:05,775
[SPEAKER_13]: We have further resolved that the Memphis City Council dedicate tonight's meeting in her honor.

25
00:01:06,115 --> 00:01:10,379
[SPEAKER_13]: For those who don't know, Lillie Scott Pelley was our colleague, Councilor George Scott Pelley's mother.

26
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:13,822
[SPEAKER_13]: So if we could stand and have a moment of silence for her, it would be appreciated.

27
00:01:27,092 --> 00:01:34,076
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

28
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:37,338
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Marks, you want to take public participation next?

29
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:39,000
[SPEAKER_13]: Please, Mr. President.

30
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:44,123
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion by Councilor Marks to take public participation under suspension.

31
00:01:44,383 --> 00:01:45,544
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, if we could.

32
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:52,902
[SPEAKER_08]: There is several petitions before us, all of similar subject matter.

33
00:01:53,362 --> 00:01:55,643
[SPEAKER_08]: I would ask that we take them all together, Mr. President.

34
00:01:55,663 --> 00:01:59,384
[SPEAKER_08]: You read it once and we'll take them all together and allow the petitioners to come up and speak.

35
00:01:59,604 --> 00:02:03,825
[SPEAKER_13]: So on the motion to take public participation out of order, by Councilor Mox, seconded by?

36
00:02:08,066 --> 00:02:09,327
[SPEAKER_13]: Seconded by Councilor Falco.

37
00:02:09,407 --> 00:02:10,127
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

38
00:02:11,307 --> 00:02:11,467
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

39
00:02:12,068 --> 00:02:12,188
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

40
00:02:12,448 --> 00:02:13,108
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

41
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,382
[SPEAKER_13]: Five in favor, one opposed, motion passes.

42
00:02:22,144 --> 00:02:23,325
[SPEAKER_13]: Public participation.

43
00:02:25,506 --> 00:02:31,451
[SPEAKER_13]: I won't read all the names all at once, but I'll read the first part of the paragraph.

44
00:02:34,733 --> 00:02:36,254
[SPEAKER_13]: The racist method website.

45
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:52,132
[SPEAKER_13]: be added to the next council agenda, a discussion regarding the anonymously posted website to include the impact on those targeted in the response or lack of thereof by the city administration.

46
00:02:52,532 --> 00:02:54,594
[SPEAKER_13]: So before we get started on this,

47
00:02:56,999 --> 00:03:06,528
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to let everybody know that this is an ongoing police matter and investigation, and it is also with the Middlesex County District Attorney's Office.

48
00:03:07,268 --> 00:03:11,412
[SPEAKER_13]: So we will not discuss anything regarding that.

49
00:03:13,594 --> 00:03:23,022
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, the Memphis City Council has no authority to take down any website or anything further like that either.

50
00:03:24,462 --> 00:03:33,678
[SPEAKER_13]: If you want to speak, please speak and do not bring up the investigation or the city's ability to take down the website.

51
00:03:38,143 --> 00:03:38,683
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Raults.

52
00:03:39,104 --> 00:04:00,399
[SPEAKER_19]: If I could just go on record as just noting that I think using this body as a forum for civil and legal matters that are ongoing that the council has no jurisdiction over and no involvement with only further confuses the public about the duties of this actual body, which are clearly stated in the city charter, Massachusetts general laws and the open meeting law.

53
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:02,400
[SPEAKER_19]: So I just want to go on record as saying that.

54
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,943
[SPEAKER_13]: If you can make a motion, you put that in the form of a motion.

55
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:08,191
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to go on record with that.

56
00:04:08,932 --> 00:04:09,853
[SPEAKER_19]: I just want to go on record.

57
00:04:09,933 --> 00:04:10,213
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

58
00:04:10,314 --> 00:04:10,674
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

59
00:04:10,974 --> 00:04:12,035
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

60
00:04:12,095 --> 00:04:15,419
[SPEAKER_13]: So, um, public participation, who would like to be first?

61
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,462
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, please, please be courteous.

62
00:04:18,502 --> 00:04:20,344
[SPEAKER_13]: Please don't mention people's names either.

63
00:04:20,685 --> 00:04:21,285
[SPEAKER_13]: I appreciate it.

64
00:04:21,305 --> 00:04:21,546
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

65
00:04:21,586 --> 00:04:22,347
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening.

66
00:04:22,367 --> 00:04:23,187
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address of the record.

67
00:04:23,868 --> 00:04:27,132
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Susan Panter and I live at zero summit road.

68
00:04:28,265 --> 00:04:36,806
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank you all for allowing me this time to talk to you about the website, how racist Medford and the negative effect it has had on me.

69
00:04:36,826 --> 00:04:42,427
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize for reading my thoughts, but I want to make sure that my thoughts are clear.

70
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:56,290
[SPEAKER_01]: Last year, I received a text message from a neighborhood friend asking if I was aware that my name was on a website called the 18 Most Racist People in Medford, posted by an anonymous person.

71
00:04:57,408 --> 00:05:00,832
[SPEAKER_01]: Needless to say, after checking it out, I was pretty upset.

72
00:05:01,933 --> 00:05:12,765
[SPEAKER_01]: I received phone calls from friends and family that viewed the website and expressed concern for me and the other people identified by the Race of Medford group.

73
00:05:13,888 --> 00:05:23,970
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently my being called a racist stemmed from an open letter I posted about the mayors not attending the police rally held at City Hall in July 2020.

74
00:05:25,991 --> 00:05:34,193
[SPEAKER_01]: I mentioned that she attended the BLM rally the week before and spoke about systemic racism, equity, and policing in Medford.

75
00:05:34,975 --> 00:05:39,137
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not protest that rally, nor did I speak out against it.

76
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:43,139
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe they had every right to peacefully express their views.

77
00:05:43,939 --> 00:05:56,705
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was disappointed that the mayor and or the chief didn't appear at the rally because I viewed it as an opportunity for the city to listen and show support for both sides of the issues facing Medford.

78
00:05:58,071 --> 00:06:11,178
[SPEAKER_01]: Personally, I do believe that Black lives and voices matter, but I also believe that the BLM organization itself causes more racial tension and divisiveness than inclusivity.

79
00:06:12,179 --> 00:06:20,723
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the people at the BLM rally, I believe I had every right to express my disappointment, and I even attached my name to my comments.

80
00:06:21,824 --> 00:06:23,365
[SPEAKER_01]: I attended the police rally.

81
00:06:23,822 --> 00:06:31,927
[SPEAKER_01]: The rally was peaceful until the BLM protesters standing directly behind us started yelling out comments.

82
00:06:32,868 --> 00:06:40,513
[SPEAKER_01]: One young lady from the BLM group jumped up onto the stone wall in front of City Hall and began to yell things at the crowd.

83
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:45,457
[SPEAKER_01]: I chose to leave at that point, but I thought a lot about what went on that day.

84
00:06:46,607 --> 00:06:49,950
[SPEAKER_01]: As a little girl, I was always taught to be kind and respectful of all.

85
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:57,895
[SPEAKER_01]: I also learned that other people's opinions matter, even when they differ from mine, and not to judge people before you know them.

86
00:06:58,976 --> 00:07:04,841
[SPEAKER_01]: I even wrote a children's book about judging people that is currently on Amazon and Barnes and Noble.

87
00:07:06,122 --> 00:07:15,569
[SPEAKER_01]: After the racist of Medford website was posted, negative comments were made on my book's review section, saying I was not inclusive and I was,

88
00:07:16,465 --> 00:07:17,685
[SPEAKER_01]: and quite a hypocrite.

89
00:07:18,745 --> 00:07:21,586
[SPEAKER_01]: Sales of the book slowed down after those comments.

90
00:07:22,326 --> 00:07:29,648
[SPEAKER_01]: The person who wrote the negative comments used a web name, Promising Actress, rather than attach a real name to their comment.

91
00:07:30,768 --> 00:07:41,110
[SPEAKER_01]: I also attended a wedding in New Hampshire and was called out by a person also attending that had seen the website and said to me that they didn't know racists were invited.

92
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:46,903
[SPEAKER_01]: Joking or not, it was an upsetting circumstance as I was not familiar with the person.

93
00:07:48,044 --> 00:07:57,109
[SPEAKER_01]: In my entire 24-year career as an elementary teacher, I never once had a blemish or accusation made against me.

94
00:07:57,129 --> 00:08:05,915
[SPEAKER_01]: I treated all my students and parents with the respect they deserved no matter their race, color, religion, or gender.

95
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:11,889
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that all people have a right to their opinion without being chastised for it.

96
00:08:12,849 --> 00:08:21,932
[SPEAKER_01]: However, they should have the courage to state their name and say it out loud so that people being accused of something can justify their position.

97
00:08:22,992 --> 00:08:34,056
[SPEAKER_01]: The people behind the racist of Medford website continue to hide behind social media walls to intimidate and make accusations against people they know nothing about.

98
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:38,201
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, they are cowards and should be addressed as such.

99
00:08:39,302 --> 00:08:46,285
[SPEAKER_01]: When the public reads those comments, do they also misjudge who you are and what you stand for?

100
00:08:47,165 --> 00:08:50,486
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are the website creators afraid to identify themselves?

101
00:08:51,427 --> 00:08:56,649
[SPEAKER_01]: This website further encourages racial tension, intimidation, and divisiveness.

102
00:08:58,252 --> 00:09:06,395
[SPEAKER_01]: In life, there will always be those who, because of their behavior, ruin the reputation of the whole group they work with or associate with.

103
00:09:07,276 --> 00:09:11,157
[SPEAKER_01]: One bad teacher makes the rest become under suspicion.

104
00:09:12,198 --> 00:09:19,861
[SPEAKER_01]: One police officer's inexcusable behavior makes the whole force become labeled and put under the microscope.

105
00:09:20,998 --> 00:09:27,344
[SPEAKER_01]: One protester's destructive act makes all protesting groups worrisome.

106
00:09:28,445 --> 00:09:40,877
[SPEAKER_01]: Until we stop labeling all because of a few, we continue pitting one group against another, unrest, tension, and barriers between all people will continue.

107
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:50,814
[SPEAKER_01]: Mayor Brianna Longo-Kern had stated, hate speech, threatening behavior, or intimidation tactics have no place here and never will.

108
00:09:51,654 --> 00:10:02,759
[SPEAKER_01]: And I agree with her, but I don't understand how she hasn't applied that same rule against the hate-filled and threatening tactics of this website, Racist of Medford.

109
00:10:03,499 --> 00:10:07,561
[SPEAKER_01]: How can she make that statement and not condemn this anonymous group's message?

110
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:09,342
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me be clear.

111
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:11,824
[SPEAKER_01]: I care about all human beings.

112
00:10:12,606 --> 00:10:16,375
[SPEAKER_01]: I love this city of Medved, and I'm concerned about where it's headed.

113
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:41,910
[SPEAKER_01]: Following the rules of this council, I would ask that a council member put the following motion on next week's agenda to vote the following, that the Medford City Council vote to condemn the racism Medford organization social media page, and that the May's July 15th, 2020 statement of the rally at city hall posted on the city webpage be removed.

114
00:10:43,012 --> 00:10:50,997
[SPEAKER_01]: I respectfully submit this, I'm Susan Penta, and I would like to have this document included as part of the official notes of tonight's meeting.

115
00:10:51,197 --> 00:10:54,319
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mrs. Penta.

116
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,100
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for listening.

117
00:11:09,709 --> 00:11:11,530
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening, name and address to the record, please.

118
00:11:12,928 --> 00:11:16,490
[SPEAKER_07]: John Petrala, 61 Locust Street, Method Mass.

119
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:20,371
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening, Mr. President, good evening, councilors.

120
00:11:24,593 --> 00:11:25,953
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just gonna go right into it.

121
00:11:27,614 --> 00:11:38,539
[SPEAKER_07]: Because of the mayor's response to a police rally and the creators of the Racist of Method website, my family and I,

122
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:44,631
[SPEAKER_07]: were the recipients of disgusting phone calls, harassment, and threats.

123
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:57,695
[SPEAKER_07]: No one should have to endure the injustice and vile accusations that were made against my family and myself.

124
00:12:00,935 --> 00:12:06,757
[SPEAKER_07]: I am sure that none of you would want your name insulted or have any harm come to your family.

125
00:12:07,816 --> 00:12:10,738
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not easy to answer your spouse or children.

126
00:12:11,618 --> 00:12:14,320
[SPEAKER_07]: Why are they doing this to us?

127
00:12:15,561 --> 00:12:19,643
[SPEAKER_07]: My only response was this is a politically motivated attack.

128
00:12:20,644 --> 00:12:26,487
[SPEAKER_07]: It was done under false pretense by unethical people.

129
00:12:29,985 --> 00:12:46,216
[SPEAKER_07]: I respectfully request that a vote be taken to have the mayor's response to the police rally be taken down from the methodmass.org website immediately.

130
00:12:46,616 --> 00:12:47,197
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

131
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:49,278
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

132
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,601
[SPEAKER_10]: Point of information, Mr. President.

133
00:12:55,142 --> 00:12:58,324
[SPEAKER_10]: We do not have the authority to remove a Facebook post from the city's Facebook.

134
00:13:05,681 --> 00:13:07,422
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't believe it's a Facebook post.

135
00:13:07,482 --> 00:13:15,906
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe it's any, any, we don't have control over the city to take down a website.

136
00:13:16,906 --> 00:13:17,227
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

137
00:13:19,468 --> 00:13:20,328
[SPEAKER_13]: When anyone else would speak.

138
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:25,290
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening.

139
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:26,411
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address of the record.

140
00:13:26,551 --> 00:13:28,012
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm Dolly Marie.

141
00:13:28,172 --> 00:13:30,113
[SPEAKER_15]: I reside at one 53 fells out.

142
00:13:30,933 --> 00:13:32,234
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for allowing me to speak.

143
00:13:32,274 --> 00:13:34,155
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President and city council.

144
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:35,095
[SPEAKER_15]: I appreciate it.

145
00:13:35,825 --> 00:13:37,566
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm also just going to get right into it.

146
00:13:38,546 --> 00:13:42,507
[SPEAKER_15]: I am a lifelong resident of Method and active member in this community.

147
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:50,849
[SPEAKER_15]: I am standing here before you this evening with hopes that the city council and mayor will condemn the acts of the racist Method page.

148
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:58,672
[SPEAKER_15]: Being included on this page has had a huge negative impact, not only on myself, but on my family as well.

149
00:13:59,632 --> 00:14:03,596
[SPEAKER_15]: The statements on this website are simply not true.

150
00:14:04,217 --> 00:14:19,432
[SPEAKER_15]: For the safety of myself and others targeted on this page, I ask this website not only be condemned, but be condemned and vote to remove the Mayor's statement regarding the police rally, which is on the City of Methods website.

151
00:14:20,673 --> 00:14:22,915
[SPEAKER_15]: The city should not be defaming people.

152
00:14:23,356 --> 00:14:29,081
[SPEAKER_15]: This is a cowardly act of whomever is sponsoring this website.

153
00:14:29,782 --> 00:14:34,286
[SPEAKER_15]: The creators of this site are making strong and very serious accusations.

154
00:14:34,927 --> 00:14:44,996
[SPEAKER_15]: Accusations that not only tarnish reputations, but can lead to serious safety issues in our community and result in the further divide of this great city.

155
00:14:45,697 --> 00:14:59,482
[SPEAKER_15]: Most community members are being targeted by the site are active and very productive people who own local businesses, volunteer their time and raise their families in a city which they've lived in a long time in love.

156
00:15:00,888 --> 00:15:12,451
[SPEAKER_15]: I would love to see Mayor Brianna Longo Kern condemn this site with the same passion that she had when she condemned the acts of the Meffitt Police Rally.

157
00:15:13,231 --> 00:15:17,952
[SPEAKER_15]: I put a motion that you also make a vote to condemn this site.

158
00:15:17,992 --> 00:15:19,132
[SPEAKER_13]: Residents cannot make motions.

159
00:15:19,673 --> 00:15:20,093
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

160
00:15:20,713 --> 00:15:21,033
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

161
00:15:21,293 --> 00:15:21,833
[SPEAKER_15]: You're welcome.

162
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:23,694
[SPEAKER_13]: Nadine.

163
00:15:24,074 --> 00:15:27,194
[SPEAKER_13]: Nadine, do you have your hand up?

164
00:15:28,435 --> 00:15:29,475
[SPEAKER_13]: Just a quick, Nadine.

165
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:37,331
[SPEAKER_13]: Nadine, Nadine, can you unmute yourself, please?

166
00:15:37,491 --> 00:15:38,692
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Nadine.

167
00:15:38,712 --> 00:15:39,992
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address of the record, please.

168
00:15:40,752 --> 00:15:44,533
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, hi, my name is Nadine Moretti, 126 Burgett Ave.

169
00:15:45,674 --> 00:15:47,414
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for letting me speak tonight.

170
00:15:47,914 --> 00:15:49,855
[SPEAKER_12]: Good evening, Mr. President and counselors.

171
00:15:50,735 --> 00:15:57,517
[SPEAKER_12]: As you can imagine, this isn't easy, speaking about being named on the Racists of Medford website.

172
00:15:58,617 --> 00:16:01,138
[SPEAKER_12]: The effect this has had on me is quite profound.

173
00:16:02,408 --> 00:16:06,049
[SPEAKER_12]: It literally had a direct impact on my ability to get a job.

174
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:08,709
[SPEAKER_12]: That directly impacted my family.

175
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:15,711
[SPEAKER_12]: Friends and family were contacting me to tell me I was the victim of someone's distorted work on this website.

176
00:16:16,611 --> 00:16:19,272
[SPEAKER_12]: Although they knew it was to be untrue, it was still humiliating.

177
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:23,773
[SPEAKER_12]: The callous manner in which I was portrayed is mind boggling.

178
00:16:24,593 --> 00:16:32,215
[SPEAKER_12]: Supporting my hometown police department, many of whom are good friends, turned into a defamation of my character and good name.

179
00:16:33,738 --> 00:16:42,481
[SPEAKER_12]: My commitment to help keep Columbus Elementary's name is attached to my name via a snippet of a video on this harassing website.

180
00:16:42,902 --> 00:16:43,802
[SPEAKER_12]: This is harassment.

181
00:16:44,722 --> 00:16:53,746
[SPEAKER_12]: The statement by the mayor on the city website condemning the very rally I attended is what spawned this racist of Medford website.

182
00:16:54,946 --> 00:16:56,907
[SPEAKER_12]: So what I respectfully ask of you is

183
00:17:00,067 --> 00:17:05,571
[SPEAKER_12]: Number one, to ask that the mayor's statement be removed from the city website only, not Facebook.

184
00:17:06,432 --> 00:17:07,532
[SPEAKER_12]: We're not asking about that.

185
00:17:08,173 --> 00:17:11,255
[SPEAKER_12]: And to condemn the racist of Medford website.

186
00:17:11,695 --> 00:17:12,096
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

187
00:17:13,497 --> 00:17:13,797
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

188
00:17:13,817 --> 00:17:20,001
[SPEAKER_13]: Steve, name and address of the record, please.

189
00:17:20,021 --> 00:17:22,863
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address of the record, please.

190
00:17:23,364 --> 00:17:24,865
[SPEAKER_18]: Ray Scafro, 9 Sunset Ave.

191
00:17:26,466 --> 00:17:29,568
[SPEAKER_18]: I attended that rally to support our local police department.

192
00:17:30,212 --> 00:17:35,076
[SPEAKER_18]: And a couple of days later, this was what was put on Yelp, me and my business.

193
00:17:35,256 --> 00:17:35,556
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

194
00:17:36,417 --> 00:17:43,762
[SPEAKER_18]: The business owner, Ray Scaffo is a sexually deviant, sends unsolicited photos and videos of himself completely nude online.

195
00:17:44,903 --> 00:17:47,945
[SPEAKER_18]: Do not trust him, your family or your information.

196
00:17:48,445 --> 00:17:51,788
[SPEAKER_18]: Send your business to someone who isn't sexually harassed.

197
00:17:53,436 --> 00:17:55,217
[SPEAKER_18]: This is what's going on, okay?

198
00:17:55,998 --> 00:17:59,980
[SPEAKER_18]: Just because I went down and I supported our local police department, I didn't even speak.

199
00:18:00,821 --> 00:18:05,044
[SPEAKER_18]: I just was there holding a flag for the police, and this is what they put online.

200
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:11,948
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, my lawyer has it, and there's gonna be reparations for this, but we're gonna go after, all right?

201
00:18:12,048 --> 00:18:18,252
[SPEAKER_18]: But this is what's going on in this city when we wanna stand up for what we believe in.

202
00:18:19,113 --> 00:18:22,015
[SPEAKER_18]: And I totally believe that this has to come to an end.

203
00:18:22,822 --> 00:18:25,463
[SPEAKER_18]: If it doesn't, it's going to be a lot of problems.

204
00:18:26,643 --> 00:18:33,925
[SPEAKER_18]: So I just want everybody to know what's, this is above and beyond this website that, uh, is going on.

205
00:18:35,006 --> 00:18:39,107
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, by the way, if I had to walk by a mirror and I was nude, I turned my head myself.

206
00:18:40,667 --> 00:18:41,067
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

207
00:18:42,548 --> 00:18:47,249
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, Kelly, uh, Kelly McGovern name and address of the record, please.

208
00:18:47,969 --> 00:18:49,170
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Kelly McGovern, 25 Franklin Ave.

209
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:59,134
[SPEAKER_00]: I respectfully ask that you vote to have the mayor's statement regarding the police rally be removed from the medfordmass.org website.

210
00:18:59,634 --> 00:19:05,097
[SPEAKER_00]: Her statement has given life to the racist of Medford website, where I have been named a racist.

211
00:19:05,697 --> 00:19:11,240
[SPEAKER_00]: Three generations of my family have resided in Medford and given back to the community in countless ways.

212
00:19:11,781 --> 00:19:14,202
[SPEAKER_00]: I am in disbelief that this is being tolerated.

213
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:19,485
[SPEAKER_00]: The creator of this website has misrepresented the intended meaning of our words.

214
00:19:20,186 --> 00:19:24,054
[SPEAKER_00]: and has added to the divide that is tearing our beloved Medford apart.

215
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:29,806
[SPEAKER_00]: When I told my daughter that I was going to speak on this tonight, she said, are you sure you won't make this worse?

216
00:19:30,046 --> 00:19:31,269
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't sleep for months.

217
00:19:32,265 --> 00:19:40,667
[SPEAKER_00]: And she was reminding me of our many sleepless nights, my fear of my family's safety, and the target placed on my back for all to see.

218
00:19:41,368 --> 00:19:49,770
[SPEAKER_00]: My husband and my three children were fielding phone calls from so many, offering undeniable support, checking in on me, knowing how distressed I was.

219
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:57,092
[SPEAKER_00]: By condemning this website, it will be brought to light that bullying of any kind will not be condoned by our elected officials.

220
00:19:57,572 --> 00:19:57,932
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

221
00:19:59,093 --> 00:19:59,373
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Ms.

222
00:19:59,413 --> 00:19:59,533
[SPEAKER_13]: Gordon.

223
00:20:07,677 --> 00:20:08,398
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyone else want to speak?

224
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:11,820
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address of the record, please.

225
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Betsy Lister, 12 Ross Street.

226
00:20:15,043 --> 00:20:16,364
[SPEAKER_04]: I wrote a bunch of stuff down.

227
00:20:16,404 --> 00:20:20,487
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm probably not going to even look at it after hearing some others talk.

228
00:20:22,121 --> 00:20:23,882
[SPEAKER_04]: I came to this party late.

229
00:20:25,783 --> 00:20:33,229
[SPEAKER_04]: I was one of those residents who didn't pay attention to politics in Medford because I thought things were going really well.

230
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:40,515
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I heard about the Columbus school situation and then I heard about Black Lives Matter and

231
00:20:41,496 --> 00:20:48,481
[SPEAKER_04]: the mayor taking a knee and then not supporting the police rally, which I attended.

232
00:20:49,221 --> 00:21:07,753
[SPEAKER_04]: As a result of my attendance of that rally, I was called a Nazi, and I was blamed for bringing the BLM children who were screaming and shouting obscenities, F the flag, F the police, F this country, F you and everything else, and then at 6.30 they went home.

233
00:21:08,953 --> 00:21:17,296
[SPEAKER_04]: It was right after that that I started getting some phone calls at home and all hours and they dissipated.

234
00:21:17,896 --> 00:21:24,519
[SPEAKER_04]: I had people call me and tell me, did you know that you're on the racist of Medford website?

235
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:25,379
[SPEAKER_04]: I go, what?

236
00:21:25,899 --> 00:21:28,540
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a racist of Medford website?

237
00:21:28,581 --> 00:21:29,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you kidding me?

238
00:21:29,401 --> 00:21:30,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Who would do such a thing?

239
00:21:33,182 --> 00:21:34,683
[SPEAKER_04]: It appears that the,

240
00:21:37,286 --> 00:21:51,519
[SPEAKER_04]: comments of the mayor have spawned that website as the comments that are on the city's website also exist on the front page of that racist metric website.

241
00:21:51,999 --> 00:21:53,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Quite interesting.

242
00:21:53,601 --> 00:22:00,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Personally, to be called a Nazi when my relatives are

243
00:22:01,788 --> 00:22:05,573
[SPEAKER_04]: were caught in the Holocaust is quite offensive to me.

244
00:22:06,214 --> 00:22:08,217
[SPEAKER_04]: I've lost sleep at nights.

245
00:22:08,437 --> 00:22:10,500
[SPEAKER_04]: I've lost customers over this.

246
00:22:11,362 --> 00:22:13,405
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've had people calling me about this.

247
00:22:13,845 --> 00:22:14,706
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's,

248
00:22:16,105 --> 00:22:29,375
[SPEAKER_04]: travesty of justice and to have my words taken that said I do not believe in white entitlement because I believe that people of all ethnicities and races can make it here in the USA.

249
00:22:29,795 --> 00:22:31,937
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a matter of choices.

250
00:22:32,437 --> 00:22:35,719
[SPEAKER_04]: If they choose to commit a crime, that's their choice.

251
00:22:35,879 --> 00:22:40,363
[SPEAKER_04]: If they choose to get a great job and do well for themselves, that's a choice.

252
00:22:41,531 --> 00:22:48,614
[SPEAKER_04]: And this whole website has spawned more racism in the city than I can even begin to think of.

253
00:22:49,515 --> 00:23:03,401
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's a travesty of justice that the mayor put up a statement that blames the adults for the language that was being spoken by the sweet little BLM youth.

254
00:23:03,961 --> 00:23:06,863
[SPEAKER_04]: And a demand that that be taken off the,

255
00:23:08,023 --> 00:23:23,910
[SPEAKER_04]: city website, and I guess we'll have to deal with the racist of Medford website through other sources, but let it be known that this trashes people, this website.

256
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:27,131
[SPEAKER_04]: It causes racism, divide, and hatred.

257
00:23:27,491 --> 00:23:35,795
[SPEAKER_04]: It's libel and slander and serves as a threat to anybody that disagrees in their way of thinking and this attempt to harm both us

258
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:41,854
[SPEAKER_04]: All of us who are on there, personally and professionally, this has to cease.

259
00:23:42,274 --> 00:23:53,323
[SPEAKER_04]: And all those who have put up this website, added to it, made it viable, promoted, share it, need to be held accountable, and need to remove it from the worldwide web.

260
00:23:53,623 --> 00:23:56,705
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that's not your jurisdiction, but I have to speak my piece.

261
00:23:58,187 --> 00:24:02,050
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want to thank you for the opportunity to allow me to speak my piece.

262
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:02,370
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

263
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:03,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

264
00:24:07,187 --> 00:24:10,830
[SPEAKER_13]: It would be my suggestion that you contact the mayor directly.

265
00:24:11,751 --> 00:24:17,555
[SPEAKER_13]: Unfortunately, we do not have the authority, as Councilor Morales stated, that doesn't fall under our purview.

266
00:24:17,895 --> 00:24:22,399
[SPEAKER_13]: Contact the mayor directly in her office or by phone or by email.

267
00:24:23,179 --> 00:24:27,382
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, she has the authority to take down whatever is on the website.

268
00:24:27,463 --> 00:24:28,924
[SPEAKER_13]: The City Council does not.

269
00:24:30,025 --> 00:24:31,946
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion to revert to the regular order of business, please.

270
00:24:31,986 --> 00:24:33,567
[SPEAKER_13]: We have one more person who wants to speak.

271
00:24:34,128 --> 00:24:34,448
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening.

272
00:24:35,817 --> 00:24:37,117
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening, name and address of the record, please.

273
00:24:37,157 --> 00:24:39,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Anita D'Antonio, 14 Yale Street.

274
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:51,462
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to speak about the chilling effect this has on free speech, any kind of website like this.

275
00:24:53,242 --> 00:25:04,926
[SPEAKER_02]: The message from this website is, think twice before you decide to run for public office, or even stand here and speak.

276
00:25:06,542 --> 00:25:09,204
[SPEAKER_02]: or choose someone or something to support.

277
00:25:10,586 --> 00:25:13,288
[SPEAKER_02]: And this site is not free expression.

278
00:25:14,249 --> 00:25:22,776
[SPEAKER_02]: It is slanderous and libelous under the guise of a personal crusade fashioned by its author or authors.

279
00:25:24,297 --> 00:25:28,021
[SPEAKER_02]: This chamber should be filled with residents expressing their outrage.

280
00:25:28,641 --> 00:25:29,542
[SPEAKER_02]: Why aren't they here?

281
00:25:31,815 --> 00:25:33,477
[SPEAKER_02]: I go back to my first point.

282
00:25:34,358 --> 00:25:54,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Who wants to chance being labeled a racist or an anti-anti-racist and find themselves, as these people have, on a website, charged, tried, and convicted by an anonymous individual or individuals too cowardly to put their name or names

283
00:25:56,770 --> 00:26:01,974
[SPEAKER_02]: to this disgrace and explain why they have the moral authority to judge others.

284
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:12,622
[SPEAKER_02]: It is the opposite of what we're all striving for, which is to stop prejudging, stereotyping, bullying, and intolerant behavior.

285
00:26:13,222 --> 00:26:15,424
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not here to criticize the city council.

286
00:26:15,965 --> 00:26:24,971
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm here to ask you to condemn this website, its anonymous creator, and in a loud voice say, we will not tolerate this in our city.

287
00:26:25,952 --> 00:26:30,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Remaining silent in the hope that no one would see this site is not an answer.

288
00:26:31,354 --> 00:26:40,096
[SPEAKER_02]: The internet has become another form of reference for prospective employers, clients, financial institutions, and many more.

289
00:26:41,156 --> 00:26:43,037
[SPEAKER_02]: One need only Google someone's name.

290
00:26:44,373 --> 00:26:46,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Silence will not make it go away either.

291
00:26:46,655 --> 00:26:50,218
[SPEAKER_02]: It is now in its third publication.

292
00:26:50,898 --> 00:26:54,441
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it's up to 30 people who have been named.

293
00:26:55,382 --> 00:26:59,765
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure there's a chance for me coming up shortly, hopefully not.

294
00:27:00,186 --> 00:27:02,968
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, by the grace of God, I'm not on that website.

295
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:09,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Saying it's out of our realm, it's not our bailiwick to do anything is not an answer.

296
00:27:10,074 --> 00:27:11,255
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do something.

297
00:27:12,528 --> 00:27:15,210
[SPEAKER_02]: Condemn this site and its progeny.

298
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:18,151
[SPEAKER_02]: Your condemnation will speak volumes.

299
00:27:19,192 --> 00:27:27,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Request that the mayor's statement that has been used on this website be removed from the city's official website so as not to give credence to this hateful site.

300
00:27:28,657 --> 00:27:36,422
[SPEAKER_02]: And I take into, Mr. President, I'll take your commentary and heed it with regard to getting in touch with the mayor.

301
00:27:37,923 --> 00:27:39,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone once famously said,

302
00:27:40,574 --> 00:27:42,716
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do I go to get my reputation back?

303
00:27:43,796 --> 00:27:54,343
[SPEAKER_02]: I suggest that the first step in your capacity as publicly elected officials is to speak out against this anonymous and defamatory website.

304
00:27:55,224 --> 00:27:59,007
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not just the individuals on this site who have been smeared.

305
00:27:59,547 --> 00:28:06,472
[SPEAKER_02]: The entire city, all of us, have been labeled as a, quote, deeply racist city, unquote.

306
00:28:06,952 --> 00:28:09,034
[SPEAKER_02]: That excludes no one.

307
00:28:09,894 --> 00:28:12,435
[SPEAKER_02]: no one in this room, no one in this city.

308
00:28:13,296 --> 00:28:28,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Perhaps the cynical individual or individuals believe Medford has become fertile ground for this behavior of anonymously shaming, condemning, and marginalizing those with whom they disagree, and that it is now acceptable to do so.

309
00:28:29,423 --> 00:28:33,345
[SPEAKER_02]: I would hope you agree that it is not, nor has it ever been.

310
00:28:33,986 --> 00:28:38,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Do not allow this cowardly act and behavior to find a home here in Medford.

311
00:28:39,288 --> 00:28:41,849
[SPEAKER_02]: condemn it loudly and in unison.

312
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:43,610
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for listening to me.

313
00:28:43,931 --> 00:28:44,911
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. DeAntonio.

314
00:28:49,594 --> 00:28:50,434
[SPEAKER_13]: Any further discussion?

315
00:28:50,855 --> 00:28:53,576
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion to revert to the regular order of business.

316
00:28:54,957 --> 00:28:55,937
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

317
00:28:56,238 --> 00:29:07,564
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would like to take this opportunity to thank the speakers, Mr. President, who took the time to come up.

318
00:29:08,763 --> 00:29:17,429
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, Mr. President, the time to relay the story of what they've been through over the past year.

319
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:22,612
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not an easy thing, Mr. President, especially in this day and age.

320
00:29:23,953 --> 00:29:38,062
[SPEAKER_08]: And this council has gone on record on a number of occasions denouncing different issues within this community and sending a message, even on issues we have no authority on.

321
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:43,201
[SPEAKER_08]: sending a message if we felt strongly enough, Mr. President.

322
00:29:44,041 --> 00:29:48,323
[SPEAKER_08]: And I truly believe that this is one of those issues.

323
00:29:51,345 --> 00:30:00,909
[SPEAKER_08]: My opinion, Mr. President, when you have an anonymous site, as was stated by the speakers, you have a site that you can't refer to anyone.

324
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:02,990
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no contact.

325
00:30:04,571 --> 00:30:05,812
[SPEAKER_08]: All it is, Mr. President,

326
00:30:07,002 --> 00:30:22,072
[SPEAKER_08]: is a hate-filled site, a site used to bully, Mr. President, to defame, to slander, to maliciously misrepresent good people in our community.

327
00:30:24,293 --> 00:30:35,101
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think everyone has to stand behind this and say, we're not going to tolerate it, whether it's this issue, Mr. President, or the issue we had last week.

328
00:30:36,051 --> 00:30:50,764
[SPEAKER_08]: We had a petition that come before us, a Method resident, an artist that put up a banner that was approved and commissioned by the parks department to put up the banner and the banners were ripped down, Mr. President.

329
00:30:52,366 --> 00:31:02,355
[SPEAKER_08]: And every member of this council was outraged because the banner was taken down, Mr. President and ripped down, outraged.

330
00:31:03,895 --> 00:31:11,041
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would hope that outrage, Mr. President, continues and carries on, because now we're not dealing with a bayonet.

331
00:31:11,962 --> 00:31:13,423
[SPEAKER_08]: We're dealing with human beings.

332
00:31:14,304 --> 00:31:25,032
[SPEAKER_08]: We're dealing with lives, families, businesses of people in our community, long-respected people in our community.

333
00:31:25,993 --> 00:31:28,796
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would hope that same outrage that I had last week

334
00:31:29,669 --> 00:31:36,513
[SPEAKER_08]: continues this week, Mr. President, because hate is hate no matter where it is, no matter who it happens to.

335
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:39,515
[SPEAKER_08]: It's hate, Mr. President.

336
00:31:40,416 --> 00:31:41,796
[SPEAKER_08]: And that can't be tolerated.

337
00:31:49,041 --> 00:31:55,685
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a policy, Mr. President, about cyberbullying within our schools, here within the city.

338
00:31:57,715 --> 00:32:04,018
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't think of any better example of cyberbullying than the Method racist site.

339
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:10,541
[SPEAKER_08]: That's cyberbullying, and I'm glad it's being investigated by the Method police, as you stated, Mr. President.

340
00:32:10,802 --> 00:32:19,566
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad it's being investigated on the state level as well, because that site immediately needs to be taken down, Mr. President.

341
00:32:20,106 --> 00:32:23,488
[SPEAKER_08]: And I have no problem, and I'd like to do it in the form of two motions.

342
00:32:24,642 --> 00:32:36,349
[SPEAKER_08]: because I respect my colleagues for saying that maybe part of the original motion that was recommended by some of the public was not under our bailiwick and it involves the mayor.

343
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:38,271
[SPEAKER_08]: And I respect that.

344
00:32:38,771 --> 00:32:44,775
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would respectfully ask Mr. President that we break it into two forms of resolutions and motions.

345
00:32:45,455 --> 00:32:46,356
[SPEAKER_08]: The first one being,

346
00:32:47,262 --> 00:32:53,246
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's a little different wording than the petitioner offered, but I'm willing to look at that language as well.

347
00:32:53,827 --> 00:33:13,701
[SPEAKER_08]: But I would like to offer Mr. President, the motion that be it resolved that the method city council denounce the anonymous hate filled website, racist of method for its defamation, slander,

348
00:33:16,147 --> 00:33:30,236
[SPEAKER_08]: malicious misrepresentation, and abusive attack on the character, reputation, and good name of Method residents.

349
00:33:31,877 --> 00:33:32,917
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be the first motion.

350
00:33:34,598 --> 00:33:37,260
[SPEAKER_08]: I do have it written down, Mr. Clerk, and I will get it to you.

351
00:33:38,061 --> 00:33:40,162
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, let me just offer the second one, Mr. President.

352
00:33:40,182 --> 00:33:44,825
[SPEAKER_08]: The reason why I split it is because I believe everyone behind this reeling

353
00:33:46,488 --> 00:33:49,210
[SPEAKER_08]: wants to stamp out hatred and racism.

354
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:52,572
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe that, Mr. President, strongly, with all my heart.

355
00:33:54,333 --> 00:33:56,795
[SPEAKER_08]: And I believe that first motion does this.

356
00:33:58,496 --> 00:34:07,342
[SPEAKER_08]: Second motion is be it resolved that the mayor's response to the police rally be taken down from the City of Methods website.

357
00:34:08,122 --> 00:34:09,343
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be the second one, Mr. President.

358
00:34:12,192 --> 00:34:15,913
[SPEAKER_08]: and members could decide on their own whether we want to just send a statement.

359
00:34:16,313 --> 00:34:21,494
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, it's up to the mayor if she wants to take that down, if we want to send a statement or not, Mr. President.

360
00:34:21,534 --> 00:34:23,155
[SPEAKER_08]: But that way, we divide both.

361
00:34:23,715 --> 00:34:25,395
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to thank the speakers for coming up.

362
00:34:27,136 --> 00:34:39,179
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, when I ran for public office, Mr. President, I ran to fix sidewalks, lower taxes, help our seniors, affordable housing,

363
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,842
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, the basic city of Method issues.

364
00:34:45,263 --> 00:34:50,527
[SPEAKER_08]: And now we seem to be getting in to a lot of other issues, Mr. President.

365
00:34:51,027 --> 00:34:51,648
[SPEAKER_08]: And so be it.

366
00:34:52,669 --> 00:34:53,669
[SPEAKER_08]: I change with the times.

367
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:55,030
[SPEAKER_08]: I move with the flow.

368
00:34:56,972 --> 00:35:00,734
[SPEAKER_08]: But as I stated last week, let's get back to the business at hand.

369
00:35:01,215 --> 00:35:05,818
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a lot of important items on our table, Mr. President, that we need to move forward on.

370
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:16,429
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think, unfortunately, we're spending a lot of time on issues, as my colleague stated, that really don't involve this council.

371
00:35:17,569 --> 00:35:20,370
[SPEAKER_08]: But then again, we are the only sounding board in the city.

372
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:21,510
[SPEAKER_08]: Where else do you go?

373
00:35:22,551 --> 00:35:28,373
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess you can get your soapbox and go in front of Colleen's, but where else do you go in the community?

374
00:35:30,283 --> 00:35:34,024
[SPEAKER_08]: This has always been the people's forum, as former President Mayorkas would say.

375
00:35:34,344 --> 00:35:35,724
[SPEAKER_08]: This was the people's forum.

376
00:35:36,345 --> 00:35:44,767
[SPEAKER_08]: And whether we like what's being said or not, public participation allows people to get up and air and vent, Mr. President.

377
00:35:45,647 --> 00:35:51,068
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's our obligation and duty to listen and, if be, react.

378
00:35:51,529 --> 00:35:55,430
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think this is one of the moments where we have to react and denounce.

379
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:56,610
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

380
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:56,750
[SPEAKER_08]: Go.

381
00:35:58,293 --> 00:36:01,315
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Marks has two motions on the floor.

382
00:36:01,755 --> 00:36:03,155
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll take the first one first.

383
00:36:03,175 --> 00:36:04,956
[SPEAKER_13]: So the first motion by Councilor Marks.

384
00:36:05,116 --> 00:36:08,698
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, I believe those motions should go on the agenda for next week.

385
00:36:10,018 --> 00:36:10,618
[SPEAKER_13]: Correct.

386
00:36:10,658 --> 00:36:12,039
[SPEAKER_13]: We are on the suspension, Councilor Marks.

387
00:36:12,819 --> 00:36:15,380
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it was on the agenda, Mr. President.

388
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:20,142
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess it was taken out of order, but it's on the agenda.

389
00:36:20,222 --> 00:36:21,803
[SPEAKER_10]: It's clearly marked on the agenda.

390
00:36:21,823 --> 00:36:26,225
[SPEAKER_10]: In that case, I would be happy to vote for the first one if those claims are proven in a court of law.

391
00:36:30,296 --> 00:36:38,140
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion by Council Marks, seconded by Vice President Knight.

392
00:36:39,001 --> 00:36:43,523
[SPEAKER_11]: I understand the situation and the circumstances and why individuals are here tonight.

393
00:36:44,803 --> 00:36:53,788
[SPEAKER_11]: I find the timing of it curious, but at the same time, I also find the context and subject matter and what people have to go through not fair.

394
00:36:56,703 --> 00:36:59,786
[SPEAKER_11]: My mother always told me, don't put something on the internet because it's going to be there forever.

395
00:37:00,266 --> 00:37:00,406
[SPEAKER_11]: Right?

396
00:37:00,446 --> 00:37:02,648
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to be careful what you say and you have to guide your remarks.

397
00:37:03,149 --> 00:37:09,154
[SPEAKER_11]: And the reason you have to do that is because they can be taken out of context, but at the end of the day, they're going to last forever and they're going to be on the internet forever.

398
00:37:11,756 --> 00:37:16,661
[SPEAKER_11]: I certainly don't feel as though this website adds any value to this community whatsoever.

399
00:37:17,581 --> 00:37:21,385
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think it does anything to move this community forward.

400
00:37:22,798 --> 00:37:27,942
[SPEAKER_11]: in terms of race relations, or having that conversation that we hear so much about.

401
00:37:30,063 --> 00:37:33,305
[SPEAKER_11]: However, we also have to think about this, Mr. President, as to when's it going to stop?

402
00:37:34,226 --> 00:37:36,167
[SPEAKER_11]: When's the Metro City Council going to stop?

403
00:37:36,528 --> 00:37:41,671
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, there has to be a point where we say, look, yeah, there's a website out there.

404
00:37:41,971 --> 00:37:43,012
[SPEAKER_11]: Y'all mentioned on the website.

405
00:37:43,933 --> 00:37:45,013
[SPEAKER_11]: The city has nothing to do with it.

406
00:37:45,574 --> 00:37:46,995
[SPEAKER_11]: The city council has nothing to do with it.

407
00:37:49,356 --> 00:37:50,057
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a civil matter.

408
00:37:50,585 --> 00:37:52,386
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a matter that should be taken up in a court of law.

409
00:37:53,207 --> 00:37:56,149
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're going to denounce, we're going to take a vote tonight to denounce this.

410
00:37:56,789 --> 00:37:57,530
[SPEAKER_11]: When does it stop?

411
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:58,210
[SPEAKER_11]: Is my question.

412
00:37:58,831 --> 00:38:01,673
[SPEAKER_11]: When do we stop taking votes, denouncing what somebody said on the internet?

413
00:38:02,233 --> 00:38:06,156
[SPEAKER_11]: When do we stop taking votes, denouncing statements that people said?

414
00:38:07,297 --> 00:38:07,597
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

415
00:38:07,817 --> 00:38:08,498
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not my job.

416
00:38:08,598 --> 00:38:10,019
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not until the night has the floor.

417
00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:10,699
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not our job.

418
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,701
[SPEAKER_11]: We're the legislative body over here.

419
00:38:13,381 --> 00:38:14,462
[SPEAKER_11]: We're the legislative body.

420
00:38:15,363 --> 00:38:15,623
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

421
00:38:16,163 --> 00:38:17,144
[SPEAKER_11]: We're the legislative body.

422
00:38:17,224 --> 00:38:17,324
[SPEAKER_11]: So,

423
00:38:17,818 --> 00:38:19,299
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I think it's vile.

424
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:25,922
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think that that's, you know, the way to go about business, putting people on a website anonymously.

425
00:38:25,942 --> 00:38:29,845
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I've always been a firm believer of if you got a problem, I'm right here.

426
00:38:29,925 --> 00:38:31,085
[SPEAKER_11]: Come talk to me face to face.

427
00:38:31,686 --> 00:38:38,629
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't understand this, you know, behind the scenes trolling or whatever they call it, the young whippersnappers these days call it.

428
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:43,172
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, at the end of the day, Mr. President, we have to think about when's it going to stop?

429
00:38:44,062 --> 00:38:48,365
[SPEAKER_11]: When is the council going to stop entertaining issues that don't fall within our scope and purview?

430
00:38:48,405 --> 00:38:50,267
[SPEAKER_11]: We can't be the Facebook police.

431
00:38:50,387 --> 00:38:51,768
[SPEAKER_11]: We can't be the internet police.

432
00:38:52,589 --> 00:38:54,270
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a lot of important things to take care of.

433
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:58,633
[SPEAKER_11]: Like councilor Mark says, we have a lot of important things that are on this table that needs to be addressed.

434
00:38:59,314 --> 00:39:05,279
[SPEAKER_11]: But week after week, I feel like we're spending more and more time talking about issues and items that are outside of scope and outside of our purview.

435
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:07,841
[SPEAKER_11]: So, well,

436
00:39:08,562 --> 00:39:14,486
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, probably the most important piece of legislation lays before the city council right now.

437
00:39:15,167 --> 00:39:16,508
[SPEAKER_11]: The recodification of our zoning.

438
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:21,992
[SPEAKER_11]: We've spent more hours talking about things that don't fall on our table, that aren't within our purview, Mr. President.

439
00:39:22,833 --> 00:39:27,176
[SPEAKER_11]: So we need to take a longer look at what direction we want to go in moving forward.

440
00:39:27,416 --> 00:39:29,277
[SPEAKER_11]: I certainly have no problem with public participation.

441
00:39:29,678 --> 00:39:31,759
[SPEAKER_11]: Come on up, voice your concerns, say what you have to say.

442
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:38,124
[SPEAKER_11]: But there has to be some point where this council says, look it, sorry to hear that, but that's outside the council's purview.

443
00:39:38,878 --> 00:39:40,399
[SPEAKER_11]: and for us to take actions out of order.

444
00:39:41,739 --> 00:39:50,524
[SPEAKER_11]: And I, for one, Mr. President, don't want to be sitting here every week having this person say, oh, this person said this about me on the internet.

445
00:39:50,564 --> 00:39:51,464
[SPEAKER_11]: Come down and denounce this.

446
00:39:51,845 --> 00:39:53,445
[SPEAKER_11]: This person said this about me on the internet.

447
00:39:53,465 --> 00:39:54,526
[SPEAKER_11]: Come denounce that.

448
00:39:55,006 --> 00:40:04,431
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it's getting to be crazy, Mr. President, with the influence that social media is having on the operations of government in this community and the direction that we're going.

449
00:40:05,099 --> 00:40:12,390
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it seems to me like it's government by press release and Facebook post correct government by press release and Facebook post.

450
00:40:13,292 --> 00:40:14,253
[SPEAKER_11]: And the problem is.

451
00:40:16,076 --> 00:40:17,158
[SPEAKER_11]: Social media is not real life.

452
00:40:17,988 --> 00:40:22,669
[SPEAKER_11]: And we are very reactionary to what we see on the internet because it's very personal to a lot of people.

453
00:40:23,089 --> 00:40:24,829
[SPEAKER_11]: Someone attacks you, you're going to take it personally.

454
00:40:25,349 --> 00:40:37,051
[SPEAKER_11]: More so if they do it anonymously or they do it behind a keyboard where they're not in front of you and you can't sit there and have that dialogue and that conversation that human beings have during times where adults want to interact and iron out their differences.

455
00:40:37,571 --> 00:40:40,472
[SPEAKER_11]: But the question I put forward, Mr. President, is when does it stop?

456
00:40:41,252 --> 00:40:43,892
[SPEAKER_11]: When do we stop acting like we're the First Amendment police?

457
00:40:43,932 --> 00:40:44,492
[SPEAKER_11]: Because we're not.

458
00:40:45,553 --> 00:40:47,253
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a matter that should be before the courts.

459
00:40:48,405 --> 00:40:49,726
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a matter that should be before the courts.

460
00:40:49,786 --> 00:40:50,246
[SPEAKER_11]: It's liable.

461
00:40:50,286 --> 00:40:50,806
[SPEAKER_11]: It's slander.

462
00:40:52,727 --> 00:40:53,448
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a civil issue.

463
00:40:53,688 --> 00:40:55,008
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not an issue for the Medford City Council.

464
00:40:56,029 --> 00:40:56,729
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel terrible.

465
00:40:57,209 --> 00:40:59,310
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel terrible for the individuals that are mentioned on the website.

466
00:40:59,771 --> 00:41:00,591
[SPEAKER_11]: Many of them I know well.

467
00:41:01,491 --> 00:41:02,392
[SPEAKER_11]: Many of them I know well.

468
00:41:03,693 --> 00:41:09,395
[SPEAKER_11]: Growing up with them, going to school with them, know their children, have coffee with them, the Met's donuts.

469
00:41:12,737 --> 00:41:14,878
[SPEAKER_11]: Many of the statements that are on that site I don't find to be true.

470
00:41:16,022 --> 00:41:19,704
[SPEAKER_11]: That's my perception based upon my experiences with these individuals in this community.

471
00:41:20,504 --> 00:41:23,245
[SPEAKER_11]: But Mr. President, we cannot be the Facebook police.

472
00:41:23,705 --> 00:41:25,006
[SPEAKER_11]: We cannot be the social media police.

473
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:32,289
[SPEAKER_11]: If that's what we're going to turn into, we're going to waste a lot of time focusing on efforts and endeavors that don't move the city in the right direction.

474
00:41:33,309 --> 00:41:37,611
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a lot of good things that are going on in this community, but if you watch our meetings, you'd think Memphis is falling apart.

475
00:41:39,111 --> 00:41:40,132
[SPEAKER_11]: Memphis is not falling apart.

476
00:41:40,773 --> 00:41:41,833
[SPEAKER_11]: Medford's not falling apart.

477
00:41:41,853 --> 00:41:43,674
[SPEAKER_11]: There are a lot of good things going on in this community.

478
00:41:44,054 --> 00:41:45,254
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to straighten the ship out.

479
00:41:45,374 --> 00:41:46,914
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to straighten the ship, Mr. President.

480
00:41:47,295 --> 00:41:52,976
[SPEAKER_11]: But ultimately, at the end of the day, in order to straighten the ship, we've got to focus on the issues that are important to move this community forward.

481
00:41:53,376 --> 00:41:58,457
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't think that us policing the Internet and posts, private posts on the Internet, are where we should be.

482
00:41:58,777 --> 00:41:59,898
[SPEAKER_11]: That's just my personal opinion.

483
00:42:00,238 --> 00:42:04,079
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, I feel very, very sorry, very badly, for individuals that are named on that website.

484
00:42:04,619 --> 00:42:05,799
[SPEAKER_11]: No family should be put through that.

485
00:42:06,487 --> 00:42:08,448
[SPEAKER_11]: As public officials, we know what we sign up for.

486
00:42:08,728 --> 00:42:09,729
[SPEAKER_11]: We sign up for the abuse.

487
00:42:10,249 --> 00:42:11,650
[SPEAKER_11]: Individual private citizens don't.

488
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:12,731
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

489
00:42:12,771 --> 00:42:15,292
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm very, very, very sorry that you have to go through that.

490
00:42:15,692 --> 00:42:18,714
[SPEAKER_11]: And I hope that you get the recourse that you need to reach.

491
00:42:19,234 --> 00:42:22,696
[SPEAKER_11]: But the Memphis City Council isn't the vessel, the vehicle for you to get that accord.

492
00:42:23,617 --> 00:42:24,998
[SPEAKER_11]: The court of law is where you're going to get that.

493
00:42:25,018 --> 00:42:25,738
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a civil matter.

494
00:42:27,619 --> 00:42:27,919
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

495
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:28,840
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Morrell.

496
00:42:29,779 --> 00:42:30,400
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

497
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:31,802
[SPEAKER_19]: I agree with Vice President Knight.

498
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:39,593
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it's a dangerous precedent to set to have the council vote to denounce what I understand in many cases to be protected speech.

499
00:42:40,495 --> 00:42:43,399
[SPEAKER_19]: Organizations like the ACLU say we have to protect the speech we hate.

500
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:45,522
[SPEAKER_19]: And this goes on on both sides.

501
00:42:46,423 --> 00:42:55,367
[SPEAKER_19]: I do not believe it's in our purview or something we should be doing to try to limit this, limit speech, whether we're trying to limit the speech of the mayor, trying to limit the speech of the anonymous individuals.

502
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:56,248
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not our purview.

503
00:42:56,588 --> 00:42:58,108
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not something I agree with personally.

504
00:42:58,489 --> 00:43:05,352
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not something that I think we should be doing as a legislative body that is essentially focused on zoning ordinances and budget.

505
00:43:06,372 --> 00:43:09,313
[SPEAKER_19]: So I would be voting against both resolutions tonight for that reason.

506
00:43:09,514 --> 00:43:09,874
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

507
00:43:10,194 --> 00:43:11,114
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President.

508
00:43:13,039 --> 00:43:16,641
[SPEAKER_08]: If I could, no one behind this reel is going to vote to limit speech.

509
00:43:17,581 --> 00:43:19,162
[SPEAKER_08]: We're voting to limit hate.

510
00:43:19,983 --> 00:43:21,343
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what we're voting, Mr. President.

511
00:43:21,804 --> 00:43:25,906
[SPEAKER_08]: This is to limit hate.

512
00:43:26,486 --> 00:43:29,588
[SPEAKER_08]: That's exactly what this is, Mr. President.

513
00:43:30,008 --> 00:43:36,131
[SPEAKER_10]: The First Amendment was specifically designed so that the government would not regulate or limit private speech.

514
00:43:36,671 --> 00:43:39,493
[SPEAKER_10]: We are being asked to censor private speech.

515
00:43:40,691 --> 00:43:44,293
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the exact inversion of the existence of the First Amendment.

516
00:43:44,333 --> 00:43:45,213
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not true, Mr. President.

517
00:43:45,233 --> 00:43:45,473
[SPEAKER_09]: It is.

518
00:43:45,754 --> 00:43:49,295
[SPEAKER_09]: I just heard six people come up and say the government should take down this website.

519
00:43:49,436 --> 00:43:51,957
[SPEAKER_08]: The government should take down this private website.

520
00:43:52,017 --> 00:43:53,137
[SPEAKER_08]: I have the floor, Mr. President.

521
00:43:53,157 --> 00:43:54,938
[SPEAKER_08]: My motion... I have the floor, thank you.

522
00:43:54,958 --> 00:43:58,500
[SPEAKER_08]: My motion... And your point of information is long over.

523
00:43:59,421 --> 00:44:01,462
[SPEAKER_08]: My motion, Mr. President, was to denounce.

524
00:44:02,282 --> 00:44:04,183
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't to limit, Mr. President.

525
00:44:04,263 --> 00:44:05,604
[SPEAKER_08]: So it was to denounce.

526
00:44:05,644 --> 00:44:12,188
[SPEAKER_08]: And this council has denounced many things, particularly in the last year and a half, Mr. President.

527
00:44:12,268 --> 00:44:15,490
[SPEAKER_08]: And we can go through the list, Mr. President.

528
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:16,951
[SPEAKER_10]: We are in the motion.

529
00:44:17,692 --> 00:44:25,237
[SPEAKER_10]: What court of law has determined, beyond a reasonable doubt, or even a preponderance of the evidence, that libel, slander, and defamation has occurred?

530
00:44:25,517 --> 00:44:30,340
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't vote for something that has not been proved in the court of law to the legal standard it needs to be approved by.

531
00:44:32,098 --> 00:44:36,320
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't know I was serving with F. Lee Bailey now, but I guess I am, Mr. President.

532
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:38,501
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, you know, it's nice to have our facts straight.

533
00:44:38,661 --> 00:44:44,062
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Mr. President, you know, I wish the outrage applied to both sides, Mr. President.

534
00:44:44,283 --> 00:44:55,086
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish the outrage, you know, when someone's getting up there and stating how it hurt their family, and members of this body can't even look them in the eye and are fidgeting with papers, Mr. President.

535
00:44:55,347 --> 00:44:57,827
[SPEAKER_08]: But when it comes to taking

536
00:45:00,439 --> 00:45:05,182
[SPEAKER_08]: When it comes to taking a plastic banner down, the outrage was palpable.

537
00:45:05,743 --> 00:45:08,845
[SPEAKER_08]: That plastic banner was palpable, Mr. President.

538
00:45:10,466 --> 00:45:13,088
[SPEAKER_08]: And I supported that, Mr. President, last week.

539
00:45:13,929 --> 00:45:14,849
[SPEAKER_08]: And I supported that.

540
00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:24,757
[SPEAKER_08]: But I equally support, Mr. President, human beings that come up and say that this website has had a dramatic impact on their lives.

541
00:45:25,772 --> 00:45:28,373
[SPEAKER_08]: whether we can control it or not, and I understand that.

542
00:45:28,873 --> 00:45:32,294
[SPEAKER_08]: I understand we can't control it, but we can send a message.

543
00:45:32,554 --> 00:45:39,716
[SPEAKER_08]: This council sends plenty of messages, and that's what we've been doing for the past several years, and in particular for the past year and a half.

544
00:45:40,057 --> 00:45:44,798
[SPEAKER_08]: Regarding social media, this is not a post between one person and another.

545
00:45:45,218 --> 00:45:50,160
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a dedicated website to attack and harm people.

546
00:45:51,118 --> 00:45:52,758
[SPEAKER_08]: And the list keeps growing.

547
00:45:53,298 --> 00:45:55,119
[SPEAKER_08]: So when we say, when is it going to stop?

548
00:45:55,479 --> 00:45:56,379
[SPEAKER_08]: It's never going to stop.

549
00:45:56,399 --> 00:45:56,839
[SPEAKER_08]: You know why?

550
00:45:56,999 --> 00:45:59,220
[SPEAKER_08]: Because no one's standing up, Mr. President.

551
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:00,980
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why it's never going to stop.

552
00:46:04,901 --> 00:46:07,521
[SPEAKER_08]: This website started well over a year ago.

553
00:46:09,042 --> 00:46:16,843
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the first time that someone has come up to this podium asking about this website or asking that we denounce it.

554
00:46:17,063 --> 00:46:19,164
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been over one year, Mr. President.

555
00:46:20,042 --> 00:46:22,863
[SPEAKER_08]: So the people listed on this website haven't got out.

556
00:46:23,123 --> 00:46:24,504
[SPEAKER_08]: They haven't been vigilantes.

557
00:46:24,724 --> 00:46:26,485
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not taking the law into their own hands.

558
00:46:26,985 --> 00:46:31,347
[SPEAKER_08]: They were waiting for the process to play out, for the investigation.

559
00:46:31,987 --> 00:46:34,869
[SPEAKER_08]: And from what I hear, we're towards the end of the investigation.

560
00:46:35,509 --> 00:46:46,254
[SPEAKER_08]: So what you see right now is residents standing up after one year, Mr. President, of being put through the stories that we heard, the businesses, the people, the families that were hurt.

561
00:46:47,074 --> 00:46:48,815
[SPEAKER_08]: and finally say, we've had enough.

562
00:46:49,516 --> 00:46:51,957
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think they have every right to do so.

563
00:46:52,257 --> 00:47:00,863
[SPEAKER_08]: And as long as I'm on this council, you know, it's only for a couple more months, but as long as I'm on this council, this will be the people's forum to allow them to come up.

564
00:47:01,723 --> 00:47:04,325
[SPEAKER_08]: This will always be the people's forum, Mr. President.

565
00:47:06,386 --> 00:47:08,187
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm not going to shy away from the issue.

566
00:47:08,908 --> 00:47:09,869
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

567
00:47:10,629 --> 00:47:11,029
[SPEAKER_08]: Good evening.

568
00:47:11,049 --> 00:47:12,050
[SPEAKER_08]: Name and address of the record, please.

569
00:47:16,269 --> 00:47:23,855
[SPEAKER_03]: I just have a couple of thoughts, and my sister grabbed me, so I wouldn't come up and embarrass myself, but here goes.

570
00:47:24,776 --> 00:47:39,347
[SPEAKER_03]: In a lot of history classrooms at Medford High School, there's a poster that says, when they come for the Jews, who will speak for them?

571
00:47:39,968 --> 00:47:42,850
[SPEAKER_03]: When they come for this group, who will speak for them?

572
00:47:43,831 --> 00:47:44,672
[SPEAKER_03]: You are the group.

573
00:47:46,672 --> 00:47:52,617
[SPEAKER_03]: that we are asking you, if you can't denounce, if you can't, what can you do?

574
00:47:52,777 --> 00:47:55,759
[SPEAKER_03]: Why have we given you the power?

575
00:47:55,799 --> 00:48:09,370
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing that bothers me is while these people were pleading with you for some justice, and we get quotes about the Constitution, and wanting to rush it through,

576
00:48:11,227 --> 00:48:26,598
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw members of this committee reading other stuff, not even giving these people the courtesy of listening to them, crossing this out, looking at that, absorbed in something else, raising your eyebrows.

577
00:48:26,638 --> 00:48:28,399
[SPEAKER_03]: How long do we have to put up with this?

578
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:31,021
[SPEAKER_03]: It's shameful.

579
00:48:32,342 --> 00:48:33,222
[SPEAKER_03]: It's shameful.

580
00:48:36,324 --> 00:48:37,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President,

581
00:48:37,964 --> 00:48:45,189
[SPEAKER_10]: I just think it's worth noting that is a Martin Niemoller quote, and the first line of it is, first they came for the socialists.

582
00:48:45,569 --> 00:48:45,929
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

583
00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:48,571
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you name and address of the record, please?

584
00:48:48,951 --> 00:48:49,292
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is...

585
00:48:50,907 --> 00:48:55,009
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Robert Pinter, Zero Summit Road, mentioned NASS, former member of this August board.

586
00:48:55,029 --> 00:48:57,230
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me just tell you something right up front.

587
00:48:57,910 --> 00:49:12,636
[SPEAKER_06]: I spent 36 years behind this rail, and I never once denied anyone the ability or the action to come before the board and say whatever they thought was important to them, because this is their house, not your house.

588
00:49:13,036 --> 00:49:13,937
[SPEAKER_06]: That's number one.

589
00:49:16,065 --> 00:49:19,429
[SPEAKER_06]: Number two, Council Mark is only asking them to denounce.

590
00:49:19,509 --> 00:49:28,198
[SPEAKER_06]: That sends the message citywide, anyone who might be watching, reporting or what have you, that we're not going to tolerate this.

591
00:49:28,859 --> 00:49:30,941
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes absolutely no sense at all.

592
00:49:32,102 --> 00:49:33,944
[SPEAKER_06]: And let's get to the real major thing.

593
00:49:34,863 --> 00:49:38,204
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Vice President, you talk about how many more times are you going to do it?

594
00:49:38,745 --> 00:49:49,630
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, this all started when the mayor of this community sent a message down to this council to say that the city of Medford was systematically racist, and you folks voted for it.

595
00:49:50,430 --> 00:49:54,192
[SPEAKER_06]: So you've already been in, you're already in this, you're already in.

596
00:49:54,332 --> 00:49:55,852
[SPEAKER_10]: Point of information, Mr. President.

597
00:49:55,952 --> 00:49:59,674
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, Councilor Morrell and I proposed that resolution, and I'm glad that we voted for it.

598
00:50:01,537 --> 00:50:10,281
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, what's kind of an idiotic remark is that we're talking about how this thing, how this thing all generated itself, you know?

599
00:50:11,182 --> 00:50:20,546
[SPEAKER_06]: And if Mr. Beers wants to have a debate any day of the week on this particular issue, I am quite sure, I'm quite sure he can be accommodated.

600
00:50:22,367 --> 00:50:23,128
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a counselor.

601
00:50:23,348 --> 00:50:24,830
[SPEAKER_06]: He's an elected official of the city.

602
00:50:25,270 --> 00:50:26,091
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's who he is.

603
00:50:26,111 --> 00:50:32,317
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what his responsibility is, not just to move on and let's get to the next subject matter.

604
00:50:32,497 --> 00:50:32,998
[SPEAKER_06]: Listen to me.

605
00:50:33,478 --> 00:50:39,544
[SPEAKER_06]: You're talking about human beings out here who for the past year have gone through a life and altering

606
00:50:41,595 --> 00:50:46,117
[SPEAKER_06]: whether it's their business, whether it's their family, whether it's their kids, or what have you.

607
00:50:46,398 --> 00:50:48,119
[SPEAKER_06]: The city has never been subjected to this.

608
00:50:48,819 --> 00:51:05,230
[SPEAKER_06]: But the cowards, and that's what they are, the cowards who are behind that racist amendment, let them come forward, take their position, and stand their ground like a man or a woman, rather than go in the cubby hole, and I'm gonna just keep throwing these bombs.

609
00:51:06,263 --> 00:51:08,444
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Max, you hit it right in the head.

610
00:51:09,045 --> 00:51:13,648
[SPEAKER_06]: The whole idea of what this thing here tonight was, people have gotten frustrated.

611
00:51:14,188 --> 00:51:26,776
[SPEAKER_06]: No matter what the outcome is with the investigation, which is now criminal, that in and of itself ought to tell you something's going on, and I hope our police department, and I hope our police department does find it out.

612
00:51:27,816 --> 00:51:31,058
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, everybody tonight has kept mentioning, you know, the mayor's comments.

613
00:51:31,098 --> 00:51:33,160
[SPEAKER_06]: The mayor's comments were written on

614
00:51:36,024 --> 00:51:39,267
[SPEAKER_06]: July 17th regarding the July 15th rally.

615
00:51:39,347 --> 00:51:40,348
[SPEAKER_06]: She wrote them on July 17.

616
00:51:41,369 --> 00:51:45,853
[SPEAKER_06]: And what she said on that, and that's the reason why they're here, and they're rightfully to be here.

617
00:51:46,153 --> 00:51:52,559
[SPEAKER_06]: They talk about that the attendees used language that was disgusting, abhorrent, and it has no place here.

618
00:51:53,556 --> 00:52:00,661
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, can somebody please come up here and tell me what was said by any one of the 30 people now recognized?

619
00:52:00,922 --> 00:52:08,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they stood there in behalf of, they stood there, they didn't even speak, they stood there in behalf of our Metro Police Department.

620
00:52:08,968 --> 00:52:13,932
[SPEAKER_06]: The people are right there every day defending us and taking care of the needs of our community.

621
00:52:15,544 --> 00:52:18,065
[SPEAKER_06]: Why would you want to turn a blind eye to that?

622
00:52:18,125 --> 00:52:19,105
[SPEAKER_06]: That's ridiculous.

623
00:52:19,965 --> 00:52:23,907
[SPEAKER_06]: Fire department, school department, teachers, first responders.

624
00:52:25,407 --> 00:52:30,529
[SPEAKER_06]: This Memphis City Council has an obligation, whether they like it or whether you don't like it.

625
00:52:31,545 --> 00:52:33,507
[SPEAKER_06]: This is wrong what's going on in this city.

626
00:52:33,848 --> 00:52:42,297
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you allow this to continue going on each and every day, and you allow these anonymous cowardly people to do what they're doing, we won't have a city anymore.

627
00:52:42,597 --> 00:52:48,003
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the divisiveness will cause physical anxiety between people, and no one will ever get along.

628
00:52:48,223 --> 00:52:49,785
[SPEAKER_06]: And you'll never see the right time of day.

629
00:52:50,165 --> 00:52:51,787
[SPEAKER_06]: The city of Medford will no longer exist.

630
00:52:52,728 --> 00:52:53,868
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what we don't want.

631
00:52:53,908 --> 00:52:55,669
[SPEAKER_06]: What you do want is inclusiveness.

632
00:52:55,929 --> 00:52:58,169
[SPEAKER_06]: You want people to be able to sit and to talk.

633
00:52:58,429 --> 00:52:59,629
[SPEAKER_06]: You have a difference of opinion?

634
00:52:59,809 --> 00:53:00,910
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, you discuss it.

635
00:53:01,530 --> 00:53:07,271
[SPEAKER_06]: But you don't go and sneak around like in the middle of the night like a thief and you put something out there.

636
00:53:07,811 --> 00:53:10,071
[SPEAKER_06]: Social media is public media.

637
00:53:10,171 --> 00:53:11,291
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not private.

638
00:53:11,671 --> 00:53:18,233
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so public it gives you an opportunity to respond, whether you're on Facebook, Instagram, or whatever you want to call it.

639
00:53:18,653 --> 00:53:19,433
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President,

640
00:53:20,073 --> 00:53:41,289
[SPEAKER_06]: I would respectfully request and hopefully that every member of this council takes its position, lets the entire city of Medford know what their positions are, because let me tell you something, this is an immediate election coming up, and it's gonna reflect badly on anyone who decides that they're afraid to take a position, because they're gonna wait for the decision from the criminal court to come back.

641
00:53:41,629 --> 00:53:45,813
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me tell you something, if it was any one of you folks, and it was your name that was on there,

642
00:53:46,553 --> 00:53:49,974
[SPEAKER_06]: you'd see you'd be acting a little bit different because you wouldn't want it to happen.

643
00:53:50,555 --> 00:53:55,897
[SPEAKER_06]: It started in this building, it started over there, it came over here, and this council voted for it.

644
00:53:56,137 --> 00:53:59,799
[SPEAKER_06]: And when you voted for it, you accepted the responsibility that went with it.

645
00:54:00,679 --> 00:54:05,221
[SPEAKER_06]: Why should any citizen who had nothing to do with anything

646
00:54:05,841 --> 00:54:08,882
[SPEAKER_06]: be held accountable for something they have no control over.

647
00:54:08,902 --> 00:54:11,743
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't know where to go.

648
00:54:11,983 --> 00:54:14,004
[SPEAKER_06]: I am so upset with this right now, Mr. President.

649
00:54:14,024 --> 00:54:19,846
[SPEAKER_06]: I cannot believe that this Medford City Council is toying with this as to whether to vote for it or not.

650
00:54:20,127 --> 00:54:22,247
[SPEAKER_06]: It's as obvious and as clear as can be.

651
00:54:22,768 --> 00:54:23,928
[SPEAKER_06]: Do your job, please.

652
00:54:24,088 --> 00:54:24,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

653
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:30,563
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, Councilor Mox has a motion on the floor.

654
00:54:30,943 --> 00:54:32,464
[SPEAKER_10]: It hasn't been seconded, actually.

655
00:54:32,864 --> 00:54:33,164
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry?

656
00:54:33,444 --> 00:54:34,745
[SPEAKER_10]: That motion has not been seconded.

657
00:54:34,925 --> 00:54:36,925
[SPEAKER_10]: I would like to make a motion to revert to the regular order of business.

658
00:54:36,945 --> 00:54:38,686
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Mox has a motion on the floor first.

659
00:54:38,766 --> 00:54:39,506
[SPEAKER_10]: Does it have a second?

660
00:54:40,046 --> 00:54:41,467
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, we haven't asked for a second yet.

661
00:54:41,507 --> 00:54:46,148
[SPEAKER_13]: I have asked for a second, and we entertained another speaker.

662
00:54:47,589 --> 00:54:49,349
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Mox, you have a motion on the floor.

663
00:54:49,509 --> 00:54:50,150
[SPEAKER_13]: I have two motions.

664
00:54:50,270 --> 00:54:51,090
[SPEAKER_13]: Two motions on the floor.

665
00:54:51,110 --> 00:54:51,950
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll do one at a time.

666
00:54:51,990 --> 00:54:56,732
[SPEAKER_13]: On the first one, do we have a second on Councilor Mox's first motion?

667
00:55:04,483 --> 00:55:05,964
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd be more than happy to read.

668
00:55:06,044 --> 00:55:07,044
[SPEAKER_13]: If you can read it again, please.

669
00:55:07,765 --> 00:55:24,655
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, the first motion is be resolved that the method city council denounce the anonymous hate filled website, racist of method for its defamation, slander, malicious misrepresentation, and abusive attack on the character reputation in good name of method residents.

670
00:55:25,575 --> 00:55:25,875
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

671
00:55:26,096 --> 00:55:28,397
[SPEAKER_13]: So on the motion of my council, my second invite,

672
00:55:34,096 --> 00:55:36,758
[SPEAKER_11]: And the motion was the president will move to amend the resolution.

673
00:55:37,579 --> 00:55:39,380
[SPEAKER_13]: That's not vice president make.

674
00:55:40,161 --> 00:55:45,606
[SPEAKER_11]: If they sponsor the resolution would be so willing to amend the resolve to excuse me.

675
00:55:49,089 --> 00:55:49,490
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

676
00:55:50,491 --> 00:55:57,917
[SPEAKER_11]: The sponsor of the resolve would be so willing to amend the resolution to put a period after the word racist of Medford and strike the remaining.

677
00:55:59,245 --> 00:56:00,906
[SPEAKER_11]: language in the resolve.

678
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:02,787
[SPEAKER_11]: I will be happy to co-sponsor it.

679
00:56:02,988 --> 00:56:09,092
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll second it rather.

680
00:56:09,112 --> 00:56:09,632
[SPEAKER_08]: Read that back.

681
00:56:09,952 --> 00:56:16,817
[SPEAKER_08]: So the way I understand it, be it resolved that the method city council denounced the anonymous hate filled website, racist method period.

682
00:56:18,178 --> 00:56:19,398
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that, is that what you offer?

683
00:56:19,539 --> 00:56:19,899
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, sir.

684
00:56:19,919 --> 00:56:20,739
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

685
00:56:20,779 --> 00:56:24,562
[SPEAKER_13]: So on the motion by council mark seconded by

686
00:56:28,304 --> 00:56:33,446
[SPEAKER_13]: The amended motion seconded by second by Vice President Knight.

687
00:56:34,847 --> 00:56:35,667
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor.

688
00:56:40,589 --> 00:56:51,693
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

689
00:56:52,173 --> 00:56:53,834
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not in our jurisdiction, so no.

690
00:56:56,935 --> 00:56:57,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

691
00:57:01,884 --> 00:57:02,224
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks?

692
00:57:02,404 --> 00:57:02,664
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

693
00:57:03,304 --> 00:57:03,944
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Morrell?

694
00:57:04,425 --> 00:57:05,705
[SPEAKER_19]: For the reasons I stated before, no.

695
00:57:05,745 --> 00:57:10,146
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli is absent.

696
00:57:10,526 --> 00:57:10,746
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

697
00:57:12,586 --> 00:57:21,368
[SPEAKER_13]: So, four in the affirmative, two in the negative, and one absent.

698
00:57:21,468 --> 00:57:22,468
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

699
00:57:22,988 --> 00:57:28,010
[SPEAKER_13]: On the second motion by Councilor Maks.

700
00:57:28,190 --> 00:57:29,970
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Maks, if you could read that back.

701
00:57:31,771 --> 00:57:39,733
[SPEAKER_08]: Second motion is be it resolved that the mayor's response to the police rally, uh, be taken down from the city web, uh, city of methods website.

702
00:57:41,233 --> 00:57:57,737
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, the motion by council Mark seconded by the motion by council Mark second invite motion to revert to the regular order of business.

703
00:57:58,218 --> 00:57:59,738
[SPEAKER_10]: We did not have a second on your motion.

704
00:58:00,661 --> 00:58:01,362
[SPEAKER_13]: I can respond.

705
00:58:01,382 --> 00:58:04,944
[SPEAKER_13]: The motion by Councilor Baez to revert back to regular business.

706

[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

710
00:58:10,309 --> 00:58:11,610

[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

712
00:58:16,013 --> 00:58:24,540

[SPEAKER_13]: Hearings.

718
00:58:56,231 --> 00:58:58,912
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we have somebody from National Grid on the call here?

719
00:59:00,152 --> 00:59:00,752
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi, good evening.

720
00:59:00,792 --> 00:59:02,273

00:59:07,814 --> 00:59:08,894
[SPEAKER_13]: This is a public hearing.

723
00:59:09,294 --> 00:59:10,875
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you in favor of this petition?

724
00:59:11,766 --> 00:59:12,266
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I am.

725
00:59:13,107 --> 00:59:13,528
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

726
00:59:13,948 --> 00:59:16,030
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there anyone else here in favor of the petition?

727
00:59:16,811 --> 00:59:19,873
[SPEAKER_13]: Hearing and seeing none, we close this part of the hearing.

728
00:59:20,294 --> 00:59:23,997
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there anyone here that is opposed to this petition?

729
00:59:25,719 --> 00:59:29,763
[SPEAKER_13]: Hearing and seeing none, we close that part of the hearing.

730
00:59:30,263 --> 00:59:34,287
[SPEAKER_13]: If you could give us a brief synopsis of this project.

731
00:59:35,374 --> 00:59:38,875
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, it's a customer at 82 Greenleaf Ave.

732
00:59:38,915 --> 00:59:47,218
[SPEAKER_17]: in Medford would like to install one three-inch conduit eight feet from the pole into their property so they can have service on the ground.

733
00:59:47,238 --> 00:59:51,480
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

734
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:55,641
[SPEAKER_13]: Do we have any questions for the gentleman from National Grid?

735
00:59:55,661 --> 00:59:57,262
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President?

736
00:59:58,755 --> 01:00:02,798
[SPEAKER_11]: Council Vice President, it looks like eight feet doesn't look like it's much of a project.

737
01:00:02,818 --> 01:00:06,081
[SPEAKER_11]: This seems like it's something that would probably take about a half of a day or a day to complete.

738
01:00:06,141 --> 01:00:06,801
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that correct?

739
01:00:07,322 --> 01:00:09,023
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, a few hours or less.

740
01:00:09,443 --> 01:00:10,324
[SPEAKER_11]: A few hours.

741
01:00:10,504 --> 01:00:11,044
[SPEAKER_11]: Move approval.

742
01:00:11,404 --> 01:00:11,745
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

743
01:00:11,785 --> 01:00:13,346
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Falco, do you have a question?

744
01:00:17,909 --> 01:00:20,091
[SPEAKER_21]: When will this work be taking place if it's approved tonight?

745
01:00:21,592 --> 01:00:25,575
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't have exact date or time, but, uh,

746
01:00:27,510 --> 01:00:33,352
[SPEAKER_17]: Regular hours can be from 8 in the morning till 2 p.m.

747
01:00:37,114 --> 01:00:42,096
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you have any idea on a date?

748
01:00:42,276 --> 01:00:44,017
[SPEAKER_21]: Would it be like in two weeks, three weeks, a month?

749
01:00:44,744 --> 01:00:46,045
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you know what this is besides?

750
01:00:46,265 --> 01:00:47,005
[SPEAKER_17]: I apologize.

751
01:00:47,085 --> 01:00:51,367
[SPEAKER_17]: That's something that needs to be done by the customer.

752
01:00:51,987 --> 01:00:57,390
[SPEAKER_17]: The customer is the one that applies for the permit to open the sidewalk and does the trenching.

753
01:00:58,570 --> 01:01:00,831
[SPEAKER_17]: National Grid doesn't have a fixed date on that.

754
01:01:01,952 --> 01:01:02,572
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, thank you.

755
01:01:03,172 --> 01:01:03,552
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

756
01:01:04,833 --> 01:01:05,873
[SPEAKER_13]: Any other questions for the gentleman?

757
01:01:06,194 --> 01:01:08,955
[SPEAKER_13]: So on the motion by Vice President Knight for approval, second and by.

758
01:01:10,232 --> 01:01:11,253
[SPEAKER_13]: Seconded by Councilor Baez.

759
01:01:11,293 --> 01:01:11,954
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

760
01:01:12,414 --> 01:01:12,494
[SPEAKER_21]: Aye.

761
01:01:13,075 --> 01:01:13,735
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

762
01:01:14,456 --> 01:01:15,337
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

763
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:17,919
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

764
01:01:17,939 --> 01:01:18,220
[SPEAKER_13]: 2-1-5-6-9.

765
01:01:20,142 --> 01:01:20,662
[SPEAKER_13]: Second.

766
01:01:24,583 --> 01:01:29,225
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion by Councilor Nye, seconded by Councilor Falco, all those in favor?

767
01:01:29,825 --> 01:01:29,925
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

768
01:01:30,625 --> 01:01:31,205
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

769
01:01:31,245 --> 01:01:31,925
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

770
01:01:32,626 --> 01:01:46,650
[SPEAKER_13]: 21569 offered by Vice President Nye, being so resolved that the City Administration establish an Abundance Advisory Committee to assist addressing the neighborhood concerns during the design phases of the car park revitalization plan.

771
01:01:51,782 --> 01:01:53,363
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

772
01:01:53,503 --> 01:02:00,067
[SPEAKER_11]: Last week, there was a meeting relative to the revitalization of Carr Park and the design and construction thereof.

773
01:02:00,107 --> 01:02:09,372
[SPEAKER_11]: Several weeks before that, this council, I believe, did appropriate some money from the Community Preservation Act to authorize this project to move forward.

774
01:02:10,072 --> 01:02:20,398
[SPEAKER_11]: And when this meeting was scheduled, I did receive a number of phone calls from area residents who expressed some concern about the final design and what the final design was going to look like and the impact that it was going to have on their property.

775
01:02:21,258 --> 01:02:27,339
[SPEAKER_11]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I thought it would make sense for us to request that the mayor put together an abutters advisory committee.

776
01:02:27,799 --> 01:02:34,801
[SPEAKER_11]: So it'll be a group of abutters that live beside the project site, maybe one or two from each street that abuts.

777
01:02:35,761 --> 01:02:42,942
[SPEAKER_11]: And what happens is they can kind of act as the point person for the residents on their street to discuss the neighborhood concerns that are coming up relative to design plans.

778
01:02:43,442 --> 01:02:48,323
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that there's some discussion about putting walking trails, for example, in between the buffer strip.

779
01:02:48,843 --> 01:02:50,023
[SPEAKER_11]: between the park and the neighborhood.

780
01:02:50,383 --> 01:02:52,964
[SPEAKER_11]: So I know that some residents have expressed some concern about that.

781
01:02:53,324 --> 01:03:02,265
[SPEAKER_11]: I know there's been some discussion about what type of equipment is going to be installed in the playground and whether or not there's going to have adaptive equipment there for children with special needs and disabilities.

782
01:03:02,685 --> 01:03:10,607
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that there's been a lot of discussion about what the final walking track is going to look like around the track and whether or not they're going to be able to loom and see the whole field and so forth, Mr. President.

783
01:03:10,627 --> 01:03:18,288
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think it would make sense for us to have some partners that are part of an advisory group that can sit there and work with the administration

784
01:03:18,668 --> 01:03:26,339
[SPEAKER_11]: as well as the design team and our friends on the community preservation committee to ensure that the neighborhood concerns are getting addressed as this project moves forward.

785
01:03:26,620 --> 01:03:32,088
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's a great project for the neighborhood, it's a great project for the community, but we need to protect the neighborhood and the residents as well.

786
01:03:32,668 --> 01:03:34,992
[SPEAKER_11]: So with that being said, Mr. President, we do have a resident

787
01:03:35,652 --> 01:03:41,957
[SPEAKER_11]: from Harrison Street, Harris Street rather, and Mr. Marino that wants to talk a little bit about his experience at the meeting last week.

788
01:03:42,618 --> 01:03:48,823
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd obviously defer to my counselors to see if they have anything I'd like to add, but this is Mr. Marino here as well to join us to discuss this issue.

789
01:03:49,023 --> 01:03:50,084
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Vice President.

790
01:03:50,324 --> 01:03:51,185
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Bates.

791
01:03:51,385 --> 01:03:52,086
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

792
01:03:52,106 --> 01:03:54,167
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll be brief so you can speak, Mr. Marino.

793
01:03:55,128 --> 01:03:57,730
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to say thank you to Councilor for putting this on the agenda.

794
01:03:57,810 --> 01:04:01,794
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that we are still in the design phase, and then after that, we'll be talking about money.

795
01:04:01,834 --> 01:04:03,435
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's a lot of time to get this right.

796
01:04:03,875 --> 01:04:05,195
[SPEAKER_10]: I think this is a great way to help.

797
01:04:05,515 --> 01:04:13,677
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, and I also think it's long overdue to see car park revitalized as someone who grew up in the neighborhood, hasn't changed much in 25 years.

798
01:04:13,797 --> 01:04:21,658
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, I think it's a great opportunity to add some, some new features, but, um, that we have ample time to, uh, to make sure that everyone involved feels good about it.

799
01:04:21,998 --> 01:04:22,238
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks.

800
01:04:23,539 --> 01:04:26,759
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Marino name and address for the record, please.

801
01:04:26,999 --> 01:04:28,580
[SPEAKER_08]: Just press the button.

802
01:04:28,660 --> 01:04:29,220
[SPEAKER_08]: Is the mic on?

803
01:04:29,260 --> 01:04:30,940
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

804
01:04:31,892 --> 01:04:33,654
[SPEAKER_16]: Joe Marino, 36 Harrison Street.

805
01:04:34,814 --> 01:04:37,516
[SPEAKER_16]: So I've been living there now for 14 years.

806
01:04:37,556 --> 01:04:39,458
[SPEAKER_16]: I absolutely love being up there in the heights.

807
01:04:39,878 --> 01:04:43,681
[SPEAKER_16]: And my property is one of the homes that does abut the woods.

808
01:04:44,602 --> 01:04:49,005
[SPEAKER_16]: I should say the trees, because I always say that it's a large chunk of trees.

809
01:04:49,085 --> 01:04:49,925
[SPEAKER_16]: It's really not the woods.

810
01:04:50,126 --> 01:04:52,948
[SPEAKER_16]: And we have Wright's Pond.

811
01:04:52,988 --> 01:04:55,810
[SPEAKER_16]: We have the Method Woods where people can go ahead and walk through.

812
01:04:56,883 --> 01:05:21,553
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that it's a safety issue, a privacy issue to be having these pathways put in inside here because you've got unsupervised children falling and getting hurt, children who are underage drinking, illegal activities, and then also the privacy issue on my part where people now walk through the woods and now they're gonna pour out into my yard, pour out into anyone else's yard who abuts the woods.

813
01:05:22,353 --> 01:05:24,874
[SPEAKER_16]: So I just feel that we have a lot of trees already,

814
01:05:26,310 --> 01:05:27,511
[SPEAKER_16]: in the city, woods.

815
01:05:29,172 --> 01:05:37,558
[SPEAKER_16]: I ask that we should not touch the trees during this revamping of car park, if not plant more trees or go ahead and maintain the woods.

816
01:05:38,039 --> 01:05:43,103
[SPEAKER_16]: There's car batteries in there, rusted bicycles, chunks of sidewalk.

817
01:05:44,003 --> 01:05:47,426
[SPEAKER_16]: If we could remedy those issues and go from there.

818
01:05:48,326 --> 01:05:51,369
[SPEAKER_16]: I ask that we leave the woods alone or the trees alone.

819
01:05:52,469 --> 01:05:53,210
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for your time.

820
01:05:53,310 --> 01:05:53,610
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

821
01:05:54,571 --> 01:05:54,811
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

822
01:05:56,243 --> 01:05:57,023
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Mr. President.

823
01:05:57,063 --> 01:06:01,266
[SPEAKER_21]: I want to thank Mr. Marino for coming down tonight and also thank Councilor Nyquist's resolution.

824
01:06:02,046 --> 01:06:05,348
[SPEAKER_21]: I think this is a, I agree with this resolution a hundred percent.

825
01:06:06,309 --> 01:06:09,530
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a good idea when the early stages of actually redesigning this park.

826
01:06:09,590 --> 01:06:12,772
[SPEAKER_21]: I was at the meeting last week and there are a number of different options.

827
01:06:13,052 --> 01:06:14,173
[SPEAKER_21]: All of them are very nice, but.

828
01:06:14,910 --> 01:06:18,672
[SPEAKER_21]: We need to make sure that this park isn't a very populated area.

829
01:06:18,692 --> 01:06:19,693
[SPEAKER_21]: It's in the middle of a neighborhood.

830
01:06:19,713 --> 01:06:27,817
[SPEAKER_21]: And we need to make sure that the neighbors who live around this park 24 seven have some input and their concerns are addressed.

831
01:06:28,477 --> 01:06:30,298
[SPEAKER_21]: So I thank council and I for bringing this forward.

832
01:06:30,838 --> 01:06:34,140
[SPEAKER_21]: This is something that I believe the administration should definitely move on.

833
01:06:34,660 --> 01:06:42,284
[SPEAKER_21]: And I would, I definitely support in a body's advisory committee, like Mr. Marino mentioned earlier, he lives around this property.

834
01:06:42,564 --> 01:06:43,905
[SPEAKER_21]: He's impacted a number,

835
01:06:44,405 --> 01:06:45,686
[SPEAKER_21]: A lot of residents are impacted.

836
01:06:46,047 --> 01:06:47,828
[SPEAKER_21]: It's great to see this park refurbished.

837
01:06:47,848 --> 01:06:49,049
[SPEAKER_21]: I want to see it refurbished.

838
01:06:49,069 --> 01:06:52,993
[SPEAKER_21]: It's been a long time and it's in dire need of refurbishment.

839
01:06:53,033 --> 01:06:56,896
[SPEAKER_21]: So I support the resolution and move approval.

840
01:06:57,177 --> 01:06:57,457
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

841
01:06:59,473 --> 01:07:02,634
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President, and thanks to Vice President Knight for bringing this forward.

842
01:07:02,654 --> 01:07:07,295
[SPEAKER_19]: I really appreciate the idea of an abutters advisory committee for this project and future projects.

843
01:07:07,355 --> 01:07:09,675
[SPEAKER_19]: And thanks to Mr. Marino for providing insight.

844
01:07:09,715 --> 01:07:15,096
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that type of insight you get from abutters is, you know, he just proved just how valuable it is.

845
01:07:15,156 --> 01:07:16,837
[SPEAKER_19]: And they see things from a different perspective.

846
01:07:16,857 --> 01:07:18,317
[SPEAKER_19]: They experience things every day.

847
01:07:18,377 --> 01:07:23,518
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think having their voices in this very important decision process is a great idea.

848
01:07:23,738 --> 01:07:25,278
[SPEAKER_19]: And I also support this resolution.

849
01:07:26,259 --> 01:07:26,539
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

850
01:07:27,259 --> 01:07:27,939
[SPEAKER_13]: Any further discussion?

851
01:07:29,933 --> 01:07:31,676
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, I just want to be clear.

852
01:07:31,716 --> 01:07:42,048
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the conversations that Mr. Marino and I had concerning this project, it's not that there's an opposition to the project, but anybody in the neighborhood wants to stand in the way of it.

853
01:07:42,549 --> 01:07:46,434
[SPEAKER_11]: What they want to do is be sure that the project comes out in a fashion

854
01:07:46,994 --> 01:07:51,655
[SPEAKER_11]: that delivers the best benefit for the community, but also protects the residents in the neighborhood.

855
01:07:52,456 --> 01:07:59,738
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, so this committee could be tasked with the function of determining what types of plants are going to be used as the buffer zone.

856
01:08:00,058 --> 01:08:06,180
[SPEAKER_11]: Are they going to have thorn bushes and tall trees or are they going to have this type of tree or that type of tree to keep people away from the properties?

857
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:07,640
[SPEAKER_11]: Can we talk about

858
01:08:09,066 --> 01:08:13,128
[SPEAKER_11]: where the path is going to go, how far away from the properties it can be, so on and so forth.

859
01:08:13,468 --> 01:08:27,654
[SPEAKER_11]: We ran into a situation with the Clippership Connector where the residents felt as though they didn't have a voice, Mr. President, and I think that this right here will allow us to get ahead of that and not see some of the same mistakes repeat themselves that have in the past on projects of this sort.

860
01:08:29,614 --> 01:08:30,294
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President?

861
01:08:30,694 --> 01:08:31,455
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, thank you, Mr. President.

862
01:08:31,475 --> 01:08:32,915
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to thank Vice President Knight.

863
01:08:32,975 --> 01:08:34,676
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this is a magnificent idea.

864
01:08:34,696 --> 01:08:42,338
[SPEAKER_08]: I read an article on the Meffitt transcript that stated that Meffitt residents had their say in the redesign.

865
01:08:43,538 --> 01:08:49,520
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a meeting at Carr Park, which they had some boards up, and that was great to notify residents.

866
01:08:49,940 --> 01:08:55,862
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not truly sure how much of a say in the redesign is going to happen during that period of time.

867
01:08:56,482 --> 01:09:11,462
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the creation of an advisory committee really makes sure that the stakeholders are there during the negotiations and are there during the aspects of the design of the park, the use of the park,

868
01:09:12,383 --> 01:09:31,525
[SPEAKER_08]: what they'd like to see, and I think it's vital that the advisory committee be accepted because, like we did with Lawrence Memorial Hospital, the creation of that advisory committee, which was comprised of area residents, was the eyes and ears of the project as it went along.

869
01:09:32,025 --> 01:09:40,372
[SPEAKER_08]: And the questions that got brought up were usually brought up by the advisory committee members, alerting city officials or, uh, you know, government officials.

870
01:09:41,092 --> 01:09:43,514
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, so I think this is, I support this a thousand percent.

871
01:09:43,755 --> 01:09:46,957
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like to see this done on every project, to be quite honest with you.

872
01:09:47,498 --> 01:09:55,184
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there should be some type of policy where these advisory boards, uh, created automatically, uh, in order to safeguard the residents.

873
01:09:55,204 --> 01:09:56,665
[SPEAKER_08]: So I support this wholeheartedly.

874
01:10:01,541 --> 01:10:02,165
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

875
01:10:02,366 --> 01:10:02,969
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

876
01:10:03,251 --> 01:10:03,613
[SPEAKER_13]: Opposed?

[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

878
01:10:05,281 --> 01:10:06,522
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion to revert, Mr. President?

879
01:10:06,762 --> 01:10:10,905
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion to revert back to regular business by Councilor Mox, seconded by Councilor Baez.

880
01:10:10,945 --> 01:10:11,586

881
01:10:11,826 --> 01:10:11,926
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

882
01:10:12,186 --> 01:10:13,367
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

883
01:10:13,808 --> 01:10:15,929
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

884
01:10:15,949 --> 01:10:19,392
[SPEAKER_13]: 2-1-5-2-7, 5-2-8, 5-2-9, offered by Councilor Scarpelli, have been tabled.

885
01:10:19,412 --> 01:10:30,501
[SPEAKER_13]: 5-1, excuse me, 2-1-5-6-4, offered by Councilor Mox, be it resolved that long-time Methodist resident, Frank Mills, be congratulated celebrating his 100th birthday.

886
01:10:30,921 --> 01:10:31,442
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Mox?

887
01:10:32,402 --> 01:10:33,383
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

888
01:10:33,723 --> 01:10:40,126
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this is the first celebration of being 100 years young that I've had since I've been on the council.

889
01:10:41,247 --> 01:10:49,771
[SPEAKER_08]: Frank Mills, for anyone that knows him, he was at a Veterans Memorial celebration at the cemetery just recently, Mr. President.

890
01:10:50,252 --> 01:10:51,692
[SPEAKER_08]: He's up and about in this community.

891
01:10:51,712 --> 01:10:54,154
[SPEAKER_08]: He's been an active member of this community.

892
01:10:55,034 --> 01:10:59,176
[SPEAKER_08]: Frank Mills has been married 71 years, Mr. President.

893
01:11:01,660 --> 01:11:09,239
[SPEAKER_08]: And I might add, to his sweetheart, 71 years, Lena Andrea Tola.

894
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:12,061
[SPEAKER_08]: 71 years marriage.

895
01:11:12,241 --> 01:11:13,961
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a lifetime, Mr. President.

896
01:11:14,862 --> 01:11:16,402
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's amazing.

897
01:11:16,442 --> 01:11:19,523
[SPEAKER_08]: He's been in Method over 75 years of the 100.

898
01:11:20,324 --> 01:11:26,366
[SPEAKER_08]: So when they talk about lifelong Method residents, Frank Mills is one of the best, Mr. President.

899
01:11:27,406 --> 01:11:31,148
[SPEAKER_08]: He owned a grocery store on Riverside Ave many years ago.

900
01:11:31,848 --> 01:11:35,812
[SPEAKER_08]: And from what I hear, he was the kindest person you'd want to bump into.

901
01:11:36,773 --> 01:11:39,936
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, if you had a need, Frank Mills was there to assist.

902
01:11:40,437 --> 01:11:41,398
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's just the way he was.

903
01:11:41,438 --> 01:11:43,580
[SPEAKER_08]: He always operated his life that way.

904
01:11:43,980 --> 01:11:44,681
[SPEAKER_08]: He coached St.

905
01:11:44,741 --> 01:11:51,207
[SPEAKER_08]: Joseph's CYO basketball and baseball teams, and they both won championships.

906
01:11:52,200 --> 01:12:10,292
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, you know, and, uh, you know, back in his early days, uh, hazma Pontiac, you remember hazma Pontiac on mystic have, uh, mr. President, uh, Frank sold cars many, many, many years ago, uh, on mystic have, and, uh, he truly is a gentleman, mr. President.

907
01:12:10,712 --> 01:12:12,994
[SPEAKER_08]: He's an outstanding citizen of this community.

908
01:12:13,434 --> 01:12:17,317
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would ask that we recognize him for being 100 years young.

909
01:12:17,677 --> 01:12:19,338
[SPEAKER_08]: And we send them a citation.

910
01:12:20,098 --> 01:12:22,100
[SPEAKER_08]: recognizing him, Mr. President, for that.

911

951
01:14:50,750 --> 01:15:02,978
[SPEAKER_13]: uh, provide information on any vaccine in testing requirements in effect and regularly update the city website with vaccination rate and test results information as it becomes available.

[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

953

954
01:15:07,781 --> 01:15:14,323
[SPEAKER_10]: just would like to know this information to kind of make a decision on whether they're going to call City Hall or come into City Hall or use other city services.

955
01:15:15,384 --> 01:15:20,446
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, a lot of this also is coming out from many large corporations and municipalities as well.

956
01:15:20,466 --> 01:15:23,267
[SPEAKER_10]: This data is being released and I think it's

957
01:15:24,258 --> 01:15:28,101
[SPEAKER_10]: helpful for everyone to have certainty, especially around this piece around the policies.

958
01:15:28,781 --> 01:15:31,343
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's good for everyone to know what is the policy of the city?

959
01:15:32,564 --> 01:15:33,865
[SPEAKER_10]: How well is it being followed?

960
01:15:34,525 --> 01:15:36,947
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, making sure that that's public.

961
01:15:36,967 --> 01:15:42,551
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it is public information, obviously, everything we do is, but making sure that it is posted publicly on the city website.

966
01:15:49,903 --> 01:15:55,705
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, I could support something that will request what is the city's policy on vaccination and so forth.

967
01:15:56,285 --> 01:16:01,787
[SPEAKER_08]: I would not support any of the vaccination rates of municipal employees, Mr. President.

968

969

[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Falco.

982
01:16:36,231 --> 01:16:42,860
[SPEAKER_21]: I brought up this resolution a while ago regarding the $250,000 from the billboard agreement.

983
01:16:43,681 --> 01:16:46,204
[SPEAKER_21]: Back a while ago when this was signed in year 11,

984
01:16:47,428 --> 01:16:53,514
[SPEAKER_21]: The company, the billboard company, the city of Medford, it was a payment of $250,000.

985
01:16:54,255 --> 01:16:56,177
[SPEAKER_21]: It was not included in last year's budget.

986
01:16:56,837 --> 01:17:00,180
[SPEAKER_21]: I found out about it afterwards when I brought it to their attention.

987
01:17:00,961 --> 01:17:04,024
[SPEAKER_21]: I just want to get an accounting of exactly what the $250,000 was spent on.

988
01:17:09,628 --> 01:17:16,853
[SPEAKER_21]: just an accounting of basically what it was spent on, a detailed description of what the $250,000 was spent on.

989
01:17:17,414 --> 01:17:20,416
[SPEAKER_21]: That money was not included in last year's budget, but I'm just following up.

990
01:17:20,796 --> 01:17:28,982
[SPEAKER_21]: They never addressed it in past resolutions, so I wanted to get a complete update, detailed accounting on how that money was spent.

991
01:17:29,242 --> 01:17:29,602
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

992
01:17:29,662 --> 01:17:30,183
[SPEAKER_13]: Move approval.

993
01:17:30,343 --> 01:17:33,265
[SPEAKER_13]: So on the motion by Councilor Falco, seconded by

994
01:17:35,048 --> 01:17:41,154
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, I certainly will second the motion, but this sounds very familiar to me.

995
01:17:41,975 --> 01:17:43,176
[SPEAKER_11]: We did bring this up in the past.

996
01:17:43,196 --> 01:17:44,637
[SPEAKER_11]: I do believe you did make this request.

997
01:17:44,657 --> 01:17:45,878
[SPEAKER_21]: I think if I remember correctly,

998
01:17:55,767 --> 01:18:01,271
[SPEAKER_11]: You raised the issue when the administration wasn't aware of the money that was associated with the billboard agreement at that time.

999
01:18:01,631 --> 01:18:01,891
[SPEAKER_11]: Correct.

1000
01:18:02,011 --> 01:18:07,454
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we need to expend, I think, those funds before the close of the fiscal year, if I'm not mistaken.

1001
01:18:08,235 --> 01:18:08,475
[SPEAKER_11]: Correct.

1002
01:18:08,555 --> 01:18:10,136
[SPEAKER_21]: It was by 630, excuse me.

1003
01:18:10,396 --> 01:18:10,796
[SPEAKER_11]: By 630, okay.

1004
01:18:10,816 --> 01:18:11,797
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, that's what it was at.

1005
01:18:11,817 --> 01:18:12,957
[SPEAKER_11]: So, very interesting.

1006
01:18:12,977 --> 01:18:18,460
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I appreciate you bringing this up again, Councilor Falco, and I certainly look forward to the results of the administration's response.

1007
01:18:18,741 --> 01:18:18,941
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1008
01:18:18,981 --> 01:18:19,201
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1009
01:18:19,301 --> 01:18:20,642
[SPEAKER_13]: So, on the motion by Councilor Falco.

1010
01:18:20,662 --> 01:18:21,582
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, just if I may.

1011
01:18:22,163 --> 01:18:22,683
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Bassett.

1012
01:18:22,903 --> 01:18:24,424
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe also we're getting an

1013
01:18:25,415 --> 01:18:27,416
[SPEAKER_10]: Something came across our desk that's a new billboard agreement.

1014
01:18:27,436 --> 01:18:28,677
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe it's for the same amount.

1015
01:18:28,777 --> 01:18:38,344
[SPEAKER_10]: So if possible, I'd like to not only have an understanding of what happened to the money that has already been given to the city, but make sure that we get a report on any future money that comes from the billboard agreement.

1016
01:18:38,364 --> 01:18:41,386
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that an amendment to the motion?

1017
01:18:41,426 --> 01:18:42,207
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, yes.

1018
01:18:42,567 --> 01:18:43,588
[SPEAKER_13]: Could you repeat that back for the clerk?

1019
01:18:44,028 --> 01:18:51,013
[SPEAKER_10]: Just that the city administration also report on plans for the future funds coming from the billboard agreement.

1020
01:18:51,443 --> 01:18:57,064
[SPEAKER_13]: So, on the motion by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Night, as amended by Councilor Baez.

1021
01:18:57,785 --> 01:18:58,545
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

1022
01:18:58,565 --> 01:18:59,565
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

1023
01:19:00,225 --> 01:19:00,825
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

1024
01:19:01,065 --> 01:19:01,925
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

1025
01:19:03,606 --> 01:19:05,906
[SPEAKER_13]: Petitions, presentations, and similar matters.

1026
01:19:05,926 --> 01:19:08,047
[SPEAKER_13]: 21-545 has been withdrawn.

1027
01:19:08,087 --> 01:19:08,867
[SPEAKER_13]: Been withdrawn.

1028
01:19:08,887 --> 01:19:08,987
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1029
01:19:09,007 --> 01:19:08,987
545?

1030
01:19:09,027 --> 01:19:12,288
[SPEAKER_13]: 21-545 has been withdrawn.

1031
01:19:12,308 --> 01:19:14,428
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1032
01:19:22,921 --> 01:19:25,344
[SPEAKER_13]: 21568 has been tabled till next week.

1033
01:19:25,364 --> 01:19:28,668
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1034
01:19:30,985 --> 01:19:33,386
[SPEAKER_13]: We have one paper in the hands of the clerk.

1035
01:19:33,666 --> 01:19:39,508
[SPEAKER_13]: 21570, offered by President Caraballo, being so resolved that Memphis City Council come in and congratulate St.

1036
01:19:39,548 --> 01:19:45,269
[SPEAKER_13]: Francis of Assisi on the celebration of 100 years of dedicated service to the residents of Medford.

1037
01:19:46,130 --> 01:19:48,030
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, as many people don't know, St.

1038
01:19:48,070 --> 01:19:50,811
[SPEAKER_13]: Francis celebrated their 100th anniversary last week.

1039
01:19:51,831 --> 01:19:56,393
[SPEAKER_13]: They will be having a celebration, I think, this Saturday at Anthony's in Malden.

1040
01:19:56,813 --> 01:19:57,993
[SPEAKER_13]: So again, I thank you to St.

1041
01:19:58,013 --> 01:20:02,355
[SPEAKER_13]: Francis for all the work they've done throughout the community for many, many years.

1042
01:20:03,615 --> 01:20:04,256
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Falco.

1043
01:20:04,436 --> 01:20:04,896
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1044
01:20:05,116 --> 01:20:06,496
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, President Cabrillo.

1045
01:20:06,516 --> 01:20:09,237
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you for bringing this, putting this on the agenda.

1046
01:20:09,257 --> 01:20:12,598
[SPEAKER_21]: Happy anniversary to all the parishioners in St.

1047
01:20:12,638 --> 01:20:13,039
[SPEAKER_21]: Francis.

1048
01:20:13,099 --> 01:20:14,199
[SPEAKER_21]: It's been a hundred years.

1049
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:16,946
[SPEAKER_21]: and hopefully 100 more.

1050
01:20:16,986 --> 01:20:22,392
[SPEAKER_21]: I know there are a lot of people in the North Bedford neighborhoods that frequent St.

1051
01:20:22,432 --> 01:20:26,075
[SPEAKER_21]: Francis, and I wish them well in the future.

1052
01:20:26,356 --> 01:20:26,676
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1053
01:20:27,277 --> 01:20:33,443
[SPEAKER_13]: I will be attending on Saturday, and we'll be sending them a citation from the City Council.

1054
01:20:35,825 --> 01:20:36,246
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President?

1055
01:20:37,876 --> 01:20:41,719
[SPEAKER_08]: I too would just like to wish the residents and all the parishioners of St.

1056
01:20:41,759 --> 01:20:46,221
[SPEAKER_08]: Francis 100 celebration and many, many more years, Mr. President.

1057
01:20:46,501 --> 01:20:46,841
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1058
01:20:47,102 --> 01:20:47,762
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President.

1059
01:20:47,802 --> 01:20:48,903
[SPEAKER_13]: Funny story, Mr. President.

1060
01:20:49,303 --> 01:20:50,203
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe, oh, geez, 25, 20, 20, 28 years ago,

1061
01:20:59,529 --> 01:21:02,573
[SPEAKER_11]: I grew up in the West Metro part of the city and I went to St.

1062
01:21:02,593 --> 01:21:12,407
[SPEAKER_11]: Joseph's Parish, that was my parish, and about, you know, I guess 25 years ago or so, a group of friends and I decided we were going to try out for a basketball team up at St.

1063
01:21:12,447 --> 01:21:12,808
[SPEAKER_11]: Francis.

1064
01:21:13,495 --> 01:21:19,819
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's a gentleman sitting across from me who didn't cut me, Coach Falco, kept me on the team.

1065
01:21:19,839 --> 01:21:27,164
[SPEAKER_11]: And that was the first time I had the opportunity to meet now City Councilor John Falco at St.

1066
01:21:27,204 --> 01:21:28,205
[SPEAKER_11]: Francis, Mr. President.

1067
01:21:28,265 --> 01:21:31,567
[SPEAKER_11]: But one thing I realized coming from such a strong parish at St.

1068
01:21:31,607 --> 01:21:33,348
[SPEAKER_11]: Joseph's and going up out of St.

1069
01:21:33,388 --> 01:21:34,809
[SPEAKER_11]: Francis and playing basketball at St.

1070
01:21:34,849 --> 01:21:39,132
[SPEAKER_11]: Francis was the great sense of community that they have up there and the great strength of that parish.

1071
01:21:40,012 --> 01:21:44,554
[SPEAKER_11]: It wasn't a Sunday that you'd drive by the parking lot and think for a second that you'd be able to find a spot.

1072
01:21:45,354 --> 01:21:50,876
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a very, very active parish, very active parishioners, a great Mother's Club, if I remember correctly, as well.

1073
01:21:51,337 --> 01:21:56,739
[SPEAKER_11]: I, too, want to join my council colleagues in extending a deep congratulations to St.

1074
01:21:56,759 --> 01:21:58,339
[SPEAKER_11]: Francis of Assisi Church.

1075
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:06,923
[SPEAKER_11]: I wish the school was still there, but it's quite an accomplishment for a church to last that long, especially in this region when we're seeing so many Catholic churches close down.

1076
01:22:07,403 --> 01:22:08,543
[SPEAKER_11]: So congratulations to the St.

1077
01:22:08,583 --> 01:22:08,863
[SPEAKER_11]: Moritzes.

1078
01:22:09,243 --> 01:22:11,264
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion, seconded by Councilor Falco.

1079
01:22:11,984 --> 01:22:12,644
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

1080
01:22:13,084 --> 01:22:13,184
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

1081
01:22:13,204 --> 01:22:13,784
[SPEAKER_13]: Opposed?

1082
01:22:13,804 --> 01:22:14,545
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

1083
01:22:15,425 --> 01:22:16,465
[SPEAKER_13]: Reports of committees.

1084
01:22:16,485 --> 01:22:18,385
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, before we do that, can I make a brief announcement?

1085
01:22:20,106 --> 01:22:20,666
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Knight.

1086
01:22:21,386 --> 01:22:29,888
[SPEAKER_11]: In our packets this evening, you'll see that we have received correspondence from the mayor relative to the mayor's ad hoc small cell committee.

1087
01:22:30,948 --> 01:22:35,469
[SPEAKER_11]: And in that packet, we will see that the committee found that

1088
01:22:38,974 --> 01:22:45,820
[SPEAKER_11]: 17 5G facilities have been approved here in the community of Medford.

1089
01:22:45,960 --> 01:23:02,695
[SPEAKER_11]: Zero Goley Road, zero West Street, 24 Pearl Street, 26 Royal Street, 48 Clock Street, 40 Ashland Street, 12 Fulton Street, 43 Woodrow Ave, 123 Grant Ave,

1090
01:23:06,531 --> 01:23:07,673

01:23:08,355 --> 01:23:09,938
[SPEAKER_11]: Zero Brookside Parkway.

1092
01:23:11,461 --> 01:23:12,443

[SPEAKER_11]: 39 Charnwood Road.

1094
01:23:15,802 --> 01:23:22,329
[SPEAKER_11]: 163 and 199 Forest Street, 59 Jerome Street and zero Yale Street.

1095
01:23:22,769 --> 01:23:36,704
[SPEAKER_11]: So, Mr. President, those 70 plus applications that were before us before the city for quite some time and we're nearing the subject of litigation have been addressed and it appears that the Mayor's Ad Hoc Committee has granted 17

1096
01:23:38,005 --> 01:23:39,626
[SPEAKER_11]: of the initial applications.

1097
01:23:39,906 --> 01:23:42,327
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that this was an issue of concern out there in the community.

1098
01:23:43,067 --> 01:23:51,331
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'd just like to ask that the city administration do a robocall to the residents on those streets to inform them that these 5G towers have been approved.

1099
01:24:08,778 --> 01:24:11,440
[SPEAKER_13]: 2-1, 5-5-1, September 29th.

1100
01:24:11,860 --> 01:24:16,083
[SPEAKER_13]: This was a committee of the whole in regards to the precincts.

1101
01:24:17,204 --> 01:24:18,485
[SPEAKER_13]: And we have another one tonight.

1102
01:24:18,525 --> 01:24:22,348
[SPEAKER_13]: So the motion on the motion to accept 5-5-1.

01:24:41,513 --> 01:24:41,993
[SPEAKER_13]: Move approval.

1113
01:24:42,353 --> 01:24:44,593
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, move to refer to the Community Development Board.

1114

[SPEAKER_13]: That was our, this will be going up, this goes up to, Council Member's right, it goes up to the Community Development Board for their comments and recommendations.

1115
01:24:55,836 --> 01:24:58,016

01:24:58,196 --> 01:25:00,397
