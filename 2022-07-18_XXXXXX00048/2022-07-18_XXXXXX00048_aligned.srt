00:00:04,408 --> 00:00:05,429
Hey Medford Bites listeners.

2
00:00:05,769 --> 00:00:10,853
Today's episode continues our series of conversations about the impact of the reversal of Roe versus Wade.

3
00:00:11,654 --> 00:00:15,096
Some of the content in today's episode includes discussion about sexual violence.

4
00:00:15,657 --> 00:00:25,684
If you or someone you know is looking for support around the impact of sexual violence, you can reach out to the Boston Area Rape Crisis Center if you're in Massachusetts, or the National Sexual Assault Hotline through RAINN.

5
00:00:26,205 --> 00:00:28,807
Phone numbers for both hotlines are listed in today's show notes.

6
00:00:29,668 --> 00:00:30,188
Hope you enjoy.

7
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:38,470
All right.

8
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:39,891
Thanks, everybody, for being here.

9
00:00:39,911 --> 00:00:45,734
If we could start by having our guest just introduce yourself with your name, pronouns, and just a bit about who you are.

10
00:00:46,855 --> 00:00:47,355
Hi, everyone.

11
00:00:47,395 --> 00:00:49,116
My name is Nicole Mosalem.

12
00:00:49,336 --> 00:00:50,057
She, her.

13
00:00:50,637 --> 00:00:59,462
I'm a candidate for state representative here in Medford and Malden, as well as interfaith, community activist, and advocate.

14
00:01:01,522 --> 00:01:03,223
And my co-host here today is Chelly.

15
00:01:04,063 --> 00:01:05,224
Hey guys, Chelly here.

16
00:01:06,265 --> 00:01:10,147
And so Nicole, we've already recorded another interview with her.

17
00:01:10,187 --> 00:01:14,029
So you will make sure to listen to that to hear what her favorite restaurant in Medford is.

18
00:01:14,089 --> 00:01:20,512
But we've thought of a different question for today, which is, is there a type of restaurant that you would like to see come to Medford?

19
00:01:23,497 --> 00:01:42,356
Oh Okay, so we have a lot of great restaurants that just opened up here in malden and I gotta say, one of the ones I really like the 110 grill they have you know fires outside with this really cozy you know vibe where you can just hang with your friends and enjoy some really great food.

20
00:01:43,017 --> 00:01:46,181
And I have to admit, they've got an excellent gluten-free menu.

21
00:01:49,204 --> 00:01:54,030
Yeah, something to be said about the outdoor ambiance of the place after COVID.

22
00:01:54,551 --> 00:01:55,972
Yeah.

23
00:01:56,092 --> 00:01:56,393
Great.

24
00:01:56,813 --> 00:02:01,038
All right, well, I'm going to hand it over to Shelley to start our interview.

25
00:02:02,007 --> 00:02:03,268
Great, let's get into it.

26
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:18,842
I think to start, Nicole, maybe you could speak a little bit about how the recent overturning has affected you both professionally, but then also maybe if you're willing, maybe personally in the context of sort of family and friends.

27
00:02:20,364 --> 00:02:26,930
Yeah, I mean, it's really difficult to describe and to put into words like this.

28
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:41,697
difficult ball of fillings that so many of us are going through right now and it's on many different levels to begin professionally it's a I guess you could say it's renewed my efforts because.

29
00:02:43,178 --> 00:02:44,599
Now there's more passion for it.

30
00:02:45,119 --> 00:02:53,001
Now I have, like, I had meaning before, you know, I had motivation before, but now it's even stronger.

31
00:02:53,962 --> 00:03:09,767
And so on days where, you know, campaigning's tough, like we're door knocking every single day, you're talking to people, you know, there's, you have to spread yourself thin between family, work, everything.

32
00:03:10,827 --> 00:03:11,628
It's very grueling.

33
00:03:13,383 --> 00:03:23,551
But as I reach those low moments where you're just exhausted, I get this as a good reminder, and it helps pick me back up again.

34
00:03:25,332 --> 00:03:33,418
And the reason why that motivation is so strong is this ruling that came out of the Supreme Court.

35
00:03:33,538 --> 00:03:36,260
It affects so many different things.

36
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:41,524
I mean, I've seen firsthand how abortion is health care.

37
00:03:44,548 --> 00:03:47,393
I was raised Roman Catholic, I became Muslim.

38
00:03:48,535 --> 00:03:49,397
Later on in life.

39
00:03:50,119 --> 00:03:54,928
And so I grew up in a very, you know what we dub a pro life household.

40
00:03:57,988 --> 00:04:07,016
But what really changed my mind and really opened my eyes, I had a friend who was severely epileptic and it was on birth control.

41
00:04:07,036 --> 00:04:12,340
Uh, she was also, you know, on heavy medication to control epilepsy.

42
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,423
She found herself unexpectedly pregnant.

43
00:04:16,284 --> 00:04:23,330
And the doctors told her if she continued with the pregnancy, it would aggravate her epilepsy.

44
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:24,571
She could die from it.

45
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:30,262
and the medication had most likely already caused severe harm to the fetus.

46
00:04:32,123 --> 00:04:34,124
And they strongly recommended an abortion.

47
00:04:35,505 --> 00:04:37,146
She called all of her friends.

48
00:04:37,706 --> 00:04:39,867
Nobody was willing to go to the clinic.

49
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:47,395
So here I am, you know, at the time I was like uber Catholic and entering a convent.

50
00:04:47,475 --> 00:04:48,996
I actually almost became a nun.

51
00:04:50,017 --> 00:04:52,840
And I was like, you know what?

52
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,862
Compassion trumps everything.

53
00:04:55,102 --> 00:04:56,603
Just my friend needs me.

54
00:04:56,643 --> 00:04:57,884
I got to be there in that moment.

55
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:02,127
And it was very eye-opening for me because I had to go and sit with her.

56
00:05:02,327 --> 00:05:07,489
It was a devastating choice on her part, but it really was a life and death situation.

57
00:05:08,229 --> 00:05:21,015
And as I'm sitting in the waiting room, waiting during her procedure, I'm seeing other young women in the waiting room who are receiving their care and waiting for their procedures.

58
00:05:21,495 --> 00:05:22,716
Some of them are crying.

59
00:05:22,736 --> 00:05:27,058
I mean, some of them spoke with me and shared their stories.

60
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:35,480
It was, I suddenly knew that, you know, it's not a one-size-fits-all policy.

61
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:36,761
Sure.

62
00:05:37,441 --> 00:05:41,062
You know, and women don't make these decisions willy-nilly.

63
00:05:41,102 --> 00:05:45,623
It's not like you wake up one day and suddenly, I want an abortion, you know?

64
00:05:48,484 --> 00:05:50,125
These are heart-rending choices.

65
00:05:51,870 --> 00:06:02,996
Government doesn't have a say in something that is so personal and something that affects somebody's life on that deep of a level.

66
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:06,438
Government does not have a say.

67
00:06:06,498 --> 00:06:11,301
That's the woman, her family if she chooses, and her doctor, period.

68
00:06:11,441 --> 00:06:11,841
That's it.

69
00:06:11,861 --> 00:06:18,926
So that's a formative experience for me when it comes to this outlook.

70
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:22,931
Roe doesn't just affect abortion.

71
00:06:25,293 --> 00:06:33,517
Roe affects many other decisions because in this country, how our laws are written legislatively, it's based off of precedent.

72
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:35,959
And each case builds upon itself.

73
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:40,101
And what Roe did was established the right to privacy.

74
00:06:41,402 --> 00:06:46,205
Not enumerated in the Constitution, but Roe made that legal leap.

75
00:06:47,076 --> 00:06:53,098
We have to set the precedent that we can assume that it's in there that the founders, the writers of the Constitution.

76
00:06:53,118 --> 00:06:56,959
You know, allude to it.

77
00:06:57,719 --> 00:07:01,220
They, you can make the assumption that they felt this was a right.

78
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,041
And they used to make the road decision.

79
00:07:07,679 --> 00:07:20,188
is what gave us contraception, what overruled banning of interracial marriage, marriage equality for the LGBTQ community, and so much more.

80
00:07:20,589 --> 00:07:23,191
This isn't a one and done deal.

81
00:07:23,231 --> 00:07:30,116
These people are coming after what we now take for granted as the most basic of rights.

82
00:07:33,097 --> 00:07:36,058
So that gets into the other side of my motivation.

83
00:07:36,118 --> 00:07:37,319
It's not just policy.

84
00:07:37,359 --> 00:07:38,419
It's not just political.

85
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:51,924
But after that decision was made, my sister called me up in tears, crying and begging me to fight.

86
00:07:52,544 --> 00:07:55,525
My sister is a member of the LGBTQ community.

87
00:07:56,205 --> 00:07:59,546
And she married her wife in Utah,

88
00:08:02,196 --> 00:08:07,604
was pregnant at the time that they got married from a non-consenting encounter.

89
00:08:10,267 --> 00:08:15,695
And in Utah, there was a law at the time called presumed fatherhood.

90
00:08:16,449 --> 00:08:30,713
that if you got married before the child was born and the child was born in wedlock, the father in this situation would be assumed to be the parent, it doesn't matter biology, and they get full parental rights.

91
00:08:31,513 --> 00:08:37,595
They put my sister's name on the birth certificate and thought all would be good, that this law would cover them.

92
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:39,315
It didn't.

93
00:08:40,195 --> 00:08:42,136
And the biological donor,

94
00:08:43,586 --> 00:08:54,574
showed up and tried to sue for parental rights and take the child away from my sister, my nephew, her son, you know, blood doesn't matter, family.

95
00:08:57,556 --> 00:09:00,479
And she fought like hell, like our family did.

96
00:09:01,239 --> 00:09:03,001
And it was tough.

97
00:09:03,141 --> 00:09:05,503
And I mean, we spent thousands of dollars

98
00:09:06,908 --> 00:09:09,589
mental, emotional anguish and hardship.

99
00:09:10,269 --> 00:09:21,192
And my sister, God bless her, that state law changed in Utah to where it went from presumed father to presumed parent and gave that same right to same-sex couples.

100
00:09:22,953 --> 00:09:26,434
So this is why she was upset because she went through hell and back.

101
00:09:27,954 --> 00:09:30,175
And she's like, all of that can be undone.

102
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:42,628
Now, if the Supreme Court continues further, like it's already indicated that it's going to, she's gonna lose her parental rights.

103
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:51,555
How many families are gonna be torn apart by this ruling?

104
00:09:53,376 --> 00:09:59,962
And how many children of the future are gonna lose loving homes because of bigotry and intolerance?

105
00:10:02,805 --> 00:10:08,647
So people have lost this personal perspective and yeah.

106
00:10:08,667 --> 00:10:19,289
Well, and I think too, like, you know, your sister's in Utah and, you know, they'll, if what this decision sounds like, it'll change is that like each state can decide what they want.

107
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:19,570
Right.

108
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:32,193
And, and I wonder for you hoping to be a state rep in Massachusetts, what is, what will your role be in like the impact of these federal decisions on our state?

109
00:10:34,043 --> 00:10:38,467
This is going to have to change doesn't come without a fight.

110
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:46,314
And people here in Massachusetts think we're safe because we've got a Democratic majority in the House and in the Senate.

111
00:10:47,435 --> 00:10:55,703
And every once in a while, we may get, you know, a Democratic governor or, you know, get a Republican governor, as we have right now.

112
00:10:56,748 --> 00:10:57,709
Wake up call people.

113
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:06,037
The row act in 2020 was vetoed by Governor Baker and passed that veto was overturned by just three votes.

114
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,499
We had a three vote margin.

115
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,802
You think it's safe, and it's not.

116
00:11:12,342 --> 00:11:14,544
That is an uncomfortable margin right there.

117
00:11:14,944 --> 00:11:20,028
So what happens when these lobbyists come to Massachusetts and start really cranking the screws?

118
00:11:20,929 --> 00:11:28,414
And not just with abortion, but keep in mind, state law can be changed by legislators.

119
00:11:30,236 --> 00:11:31,957
You may think it's one and done, and it's not.

120
00:11:32,217 --> 00:11:34,039
They can always go back and change the law.

121
00:11:36,033 --> 00:11:39,015
But now we're looking at, again, marriage equality.

122
00:11:39,596 --> 00:11:41,978
And we're looking at contraception.

123
00:11:42,058 --> 00:11:47,222
And we're looking at basic privacy rights that are going to go back to the states.

124
00:11:49,564 --> 00:11:52,887
So first and foremost, we've got to protect Massachusetts.

125
00:11:53,167 --> 00:11:58,951
And we can have zero doubt about anything being able to pass here in Massachusetts.

126
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:03,695
But then we also got to consider this federal part.

127
00:12:04,756 --> 00:12:06,457
we can't just think about ourselves.

128
00:12:07,338 --> 00:12:18,106
You know, we've got 49 other states, you know, in this country, and women everywhere are going to be suffering the consequences from this disastrous decision.

129
00:12:18,266 --> 00:12:29,114
And the only way that we're going to put pressure on the federal government is if we build a coalition of states that are willing to work together to push back.

130
00:12:29,134 --> 00:12:33,257
And we need to get out of the defensive and go on the offensive.

131
00:12:34,709 --> 00:12:43,735
And that's when it comes to, a lot of this comes down to our constitution, to the constitution of the United States of America.

132
00:12:45,376 --> 00:12:49,578
And we're going to have to, you know, we need to call for a constitutional convention.

133
00:12:50,038 --> 00:12:59,404
If we need to make some amendments to our constitution, if we can't get our federal legislature to do what's right, which we already know it's in gridlock.

134
00:13:01,913 --> 00:13:06,436
These are the routes that we're going to have to do and we need to be prepared to take that fight.

135
00:13:07,636 --> 00:13:11,518
And so that's I'm telling you, people need to wake up.

136
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:19,503
Yeah, I think some in states like Massachusetts, like you described, because I think we have a reputation for being or being pretty progressive.

137
00:13:19,943 --> 00:13:22,705
And a lot of those elected officials might be Democrats.

138
00:13:22,785 --> 00:13:23,005
Right.

139
00:13:23,085 --> 00:13:24,046
That we assume.

140
00:13:24,906 --> 00:13:32,317
that they're going to support some things like this in there that we can be like a little bit complacent sometimes and how we vocalize our support for these issues.

141
00:13:32,798 --> 00:13:39,067
And I think you make a great point and I did not know that that this that that was that like the codification of row in 2020.

142
00:13:39,968 --> 00:14:02,054
that only passed by three votes right and like I think these are tricky issues in terms of like they don't always fall down like party lines and there's a you mentioned like roman catholicism right that this is a very catholic state right and it's like traditionally been a very catholic state and so how we understand these issues those you know um

143
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:10,260
Roe v. Wade, abortion, like women's rights and LGBTQ rights in a state that has that type of history.

144
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,782
I think it's not always what we think it is.

145
00:14:12,863 --> 00:14:13,043
Right.

146
00:14:13,723 --> 00:14:15,285
So, I mean, I appreciate you bringing that up.

147
00:14:15,305 --> 00:14:18,687
And I think it's something to think about when you go to vote.

148
00:14:18,747 --> 00:14:18,907
Right.

149
00:14:18,948 --> 00:14:23,051
Like, I might vote for Democrats because that's the party that I align with.

150
00:14:23,131 --> 00:14:24,892
But what do I know about those Democrats?

151
00:14:24,952 --> 00:14:25,133
Right.

152
00:14:25,513 --> 00:14:28,135
We have a Democratic representative right now.

153
00:14:29,717 --> 00:14:30,998
And I don't know how he's voted on.

154
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:34,662
I don't think it's like something that a lot of people know how he's voted on some of these things.

155
00:14:34,702 --> 00:14:34,962
Yeah.

156
00:14:36,623 --> 00:14:51,016
That's why, you know, we did, recently we did a Twitter thread because we were letting people know that this is how, you know, our current representative who I'm challenging has been voting on these issues.

157
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:54,379
And people were like, no,

158
00:14:55,863 --> 00:14:58,527
He doesn't believe that way or he hasn't voted that way.

159
00:14:59,188 --> 00:15:00,189
They don't want to believe it.

160
00:15:00,209 --> 00:15:10,522
And I'm like, okay, so you know people are accusing us of fake news, I'm like here's the receipts I don't like to make claims that I don't have data and proof.

161
00:15:12,865 --> 00:15:13,765
And so that's what we did.

162
00:15:13,825 --> 00:15:22,828
We did a whole Twitter thread about it where vote after vote after vote recorded, you know, in black and white, and people were just absolutely floored.

163
00:15:22,948 --> 00:15:27,670
And I was shocked at how, you know, much attention that one tweet got, basically.

164
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:38,593
But now the the community knows and it's what's frustrating is we've been having this conversation on the doors

165
00:15:39,317 --> 00:15:49,227
and we get into this language of pro-life, pro-choice, anti-abortion, anti-life, whatever you want to go with it.

166
00:15:49,668 --> 00:15:52,471
But here's, I think, what it boils down to.

167
00:15:53,151 --> 00:15:57,516
And this is how I put it in terms when I'm speaking to people here in Medford.

168
00:15:57,536 --> 00:15:58,677
It is...

169
00:16:02,593 --> 00:16:06,676
Almost everyone I speak to believes that abortion is necessary on some level.

170
00:16:07,196 --> 00:16:08,657
Women have to have access.

171
00:16:09,558 --> 00:16:10,879
It doesn't matter your faith.

172
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:12,320
It doesn't matter your culture.

173
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,782
Like it crosses the lines everywhere.

174
00:16:14,942 --> 00:16:17,964
Like people understand that abortion is healthcare.

175
00:16:18,525 --> 00:16:25,129
They just have this misconception that it's, you know, one day a woman wakes up and says, I don't want this pregnancy.

176
00:16:25,149 --> 00:16:25,810
I'm gonna get rid of it.

177
00:16:27,571 --> 00:16:29,392
I'm like, no, if you really,

178
00:16:30,518 --> 00:16:34,162
want to be pro-life, and I think we should be claiming that title.

179
00:16:34,322 --> 00:16:51,238
If you really are pro-life, then you want to take care of that life and everybody impacted by it, everybody caring for it, every moment that that life exists, from first breath to last.

180
00:16:52,748 --> 00:17:09,243
And so the fact that we have children going to the doctors with UTIs because they're sitting in diapers, dirty diapers all day, because their family can't afford, you know, diapers and we don't cover it with SNAP benefits or any other benefits.

181
00:17:09,303 --> 00:17:11,105
It's a pure cash expense for the parents.

182
00:17:11,746 --> 00:17:15,429
And that's a lot, like babies go through a lot of freaking diapers.

183
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:17,030
I got three, I know.

184
00:17:19,996 --> 00:17:20,836
That's shameful.

185
00:17:21,757 --> 00:17:29,379
Or what about, and people are shocked to hear it, that in this day and age, a woman can still lose her job for being pregnant.

186
00:17:29,879 --> 00:17:42,003
And the loophole, the carve out, is that if they're in that probationary period, when they're first hired, and it can be upwards 90 months, or I mean, excuse me, 90 days or six months, so three to six months,

187
00:17:42,463 --> 00:17:46,065
A woman could be in her initial probationary period when you first start a job.

188
00:17:46,505 --> 00:17:50,106
You find yourself unexpectedly pregnant and your employer finds out they can get rid of you.

189
00:17:50,466 --> 00:17:51,327
No questions asked.

190
00:17:52,227 --> 00:17:52,507
Sure.

191
00:17:53,408 --> 00:17:54,608
And what about health care?

192
00:17:55,469 --> 00:17:59,310
Like for myself, my first pregnancy was in Utah.

193
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:01,071
That's a Republican state.

194
00:18:01,091 --> 00:18:07,794
And, you know, they're better than most other Republican states because they actually have a little bit of compassion.

195
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:10,555
But even then,

196
00:18:11,522 --> 00:18:25,987
Like I didn't have healthcare and because I didn't have access to healthcare when I was younger and I had a genetic disorder that went undiagnosed and caused a lot of problems during my first pregnancy, I almost died.

197
00:18:26,007 --> 00:18:35,051
They went out and they told my family that they were giving up and I wasn't going to make it.

198
00:18:37,292 --> 00:18:37,432
And

199
00:18:38,967 --> 00:18:46,051
I miraculously, you know, I was hemorrhaging and I miraculously stopped.

200
00:18:46,732 --> 00:18:50,094
And that was after they had already done more than everything that they could do.

201
00:18:50,894 --> 00:18:52,635
And that was a steep recovery.

202
00:18:52,695 --> 00:18:54,436
I was in and out of the hospital for a while.

203
00:18:55,637 --> 00:18:59,699
The condition that I have flared up really bad.

204
00:18:59,719 --> 00:19:00,500
I was in a wheelchair.

205
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:11,987
And after a certain amount of time, they take your healthcare away because yeah, they give it to you while you're pregnant, but they don't give it to you for like postnatal when you're trying to take care of a baby.

206
00:19:12,007 --> 00:19:13,768
Yeah.

207
00:19:13,968 --> 00:19:17,749
I'm like, we're not taking a look at the whole picture.

208
00:19:17,909 --> 00:19:31,212
And so there were times when it was very difficult and I ended up with permanent damage to my body because I couldn't access the care that I needed.

209
00:19:32,688 --> 00:19:46,324
And that, and I was only able to have my two other children because it was here in Massachusetts, where I had more access to health care, which is, and I was able to see the difference like night and day, we don't have that in every single state.

210
00:19:48,777 --> 00:19:51,578
just people don't think about the complexity of this issue.

211
00:19:51,658 --> 00:20:06,645
And until you uplift women and relieve these burdens so that they don't have to think about this being a type of scenario where, oh, a child or my job, my ability to keep a roof over my head and food in my mouth.

212
00:20:06,825 --> 00:20:10,847
And if they have other children, be able to provide for their other children.

213
00:20:11,987 --> 00:20:21,071
or a life and death situation of, do I continue with my pregnancy knowing I'm a high-risk pregnancy and I don't have access to proper medical care?

214
00:20:26,213 --> 00:20:29,195
People don't think in these terms, that's really what's going through a woman's head.

215
00:20:29,275 --> 00:20:33,237
It's not like, oh, I just don't care about this life growing inside of me.

216
00:20:33,657 --> 00:20:37,919
It's really like you think about all these other things.

217
00:20:39,213 --> 00:20:44,876
And so once you put it in those terms, people really wake up, and they really see it.

218
00:20:45,757 --> 00:20:57,023
And we agree I'm like, I would rather as a legislator be supporting life and relieving these types of situations than just, you know, making everybody suffer and say yeah, you can't have it.

219
00:20:58,493 --> 00:21:06,397
And it sounds, Shelly's made this point a few times, I think that when we think about the creation of a potential life, there's most likely two people involved, right?

220
00:21:06,817 --> 00:21:17,263
And these, this, like the overturning of Roe, it only focuses on the pregnant person and how to like almost like criminalize their decision, right?

221
00:21:17,783 --> 00:21:17,963
Yeah.

222
00:21:19,952 --> 00:21:28,476
But what about some of these guys who go around and take absolutely no responsibility and have how many children by how many different women?

223
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:30,797
Where's their responsibility?

224
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:34,178
You know, we don't hold them accountable.

225
00:21:34,718 --> 00:21:37,720
And what about the women who have been raped but didn't speak up?

226
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:43,102
We know most rapes do not go reported.

227
00:21:45,265 --> 00:21:45,445
Right?

228
00:21:46,105 --> 00:21:46,325
Yeah.

229
00:21:46,465 --> 00:21:51,687
We talked about this on a different episode about how sexual assault is difficult to prove.

230
00:21:51,747 --> 00:21:57,928
And if that's the exception for abortion, how is that supposed to magically start working?

231
00:21:59,088 --> 00:21:59,348
Yeah.

232
00:22:00,789 --> 00:22:10,851
I'm like, you know, this is a deeply emotional topic, you know, for myself and for other women.

233
00:22:12,452 --> 00:22:13,692
People don't realize how

234
00:22:14,782 --> 00:22:18,243
deeply seated these issues are and how widespread.

235
00:22:19,223 --> 00:22:25,005
And I'm gonna reveal a shocker that I don't reveal that often, but I have permission.

236
00:22:26,966 --> 00:22:33,448
Every single woman in my family, in my immediate family, has been sexually assaulted and raped.

237
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:43,371
And none of them were reported or prosecuted.

238
00:22:45,745 --> 00:22:47,706
There are three of us.

239
00:22:50,126 --> 00:22:50,446
Yeah.

240
00:22:50,626 --> 00:22:54,487
And I think, you know, Roe brings to mind like bodily autonomy, right?

241
00:22:54,527 --> 00:22:59,509
And like rights that we have over our own body and sexual trauma certainly overlaps with that, right?

242
00:22:59,549 --> 00:23:07,151
Like the ways in which people think they can control our bodies or, and in this legislation, like directly does, right?

243
00:23:07,171 --> 00:23:11,952
This is like somebody making a choice for us and taking a choice away from us.

244
00:23:13,305 --> 00:23:18,926
And I work in this field of sexual violence and I think what this decision in that same way, right?

245
00:23:18,947 --> 00:23:26,268
Like how we're taking choice away is really triggering for survivors, whether or not they've had to access abortion services or not.

246
00:23:26,909 --> 00:23:27,169
Yeah.

247
00:23:27,549 --> 00:23:27,709
Yeah.

248
00:23:29,109 --> 00:23:33,590
And it's, we don't, society doesn't have the proper perspective.

249
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:38,972
And so I can guarantee you, I make a promise to every single woman,

250
00:23:41,805 --> 00:24:03,598
And I mean that, you know, whether, however you identify, you know, born woman or not, but you know, every woman, every member of the LGBTQ community, every marginalized person out there, I feel the pain.

251
00:24:04,844 --> 00:24:07,645
And the anger that's going through so many of you right now.

252
00:24:08,445 --> 00:24:22,471
I share that and I will fight like hell wherever I end up doing it, whether it's in the state house, like I'm hoping, or, you know, anywhere else that I can go after this, I'll be fighting like hell.

253
00:24:23,711 --> 00:24:25,072
Cause we're not going down without it.

254
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:42,867
Yeah, so I thank you for all of this, like for the personal sharing and the hopes for your position to be elected.

255
00:24:43,668 --> 00:24:46,931
I'm wondering if there's anything else that you were hoping to share with us today.

256
00:24:49,573 --> 00:24:55,698
Just I really implore people wake up before it's too late and don't think we're safe.

257
00:24:56,378 --> 00:24:58,900
Don't make if your decision is coming down to

258
00:25:00,157 --> 00:25:04,199
you know, oh, it's everything else is okay and we're safe here in Massachusetts.

259
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,080
We're not.

260
00:25:08,142 --> 00:25:15,886
You know, the moment that we stop caring about these issues, the moment we become complacent, we've just learned that's when it goes away.

261
00:25:19,988 --> 00:25:20,508
Yeah, um,

262
00:25:25,183 --> 00:25:29,946
Earlier while speaking, you were talking about coalition building.

263
00:25:31,007 --> 00:25:41,773
And I wonder in conclusion, if maybe you could speak to, I'm sorry, what that would look like and if the ROAC could serve as a template for other states.

264
00:25:42,594 --> 00:25:42,934
Sorry.

265
00:25:46,276 --> 00:25:49,098
You sound like you got a lot of fun going in the background over there.

266
00:25:49,118 --> 00:25:50,298
So much joy.

267
00:25:52,113 --> 00:25:57,895
But yeah, just if you could speak to what this coalition building look like, if there's space for templates, what are we doing right?

268
00:25:58,015 --> 00:25:58,755
What are we doing wrong?

269
00:26:00,456 --> 00:26:01,196
Yeah.

270
00:26:01,936 --> 00:26:11,020
You know, I think we're going to have to look at those two came before us, you know, this is they formed.

271
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:20,903
So whenever we have made changes to the Constitution, it's been by forming, you know, these coalitions, state by state, and

272
00:26:21,473 --> 00:26:22,534
bringing us all together.

273
00:26:22,634 --> 00:26:23,895
And that's what we're going to have to do.

274
00:26:24,075 --> 00:26:30,800
We're going to have to have delegations that are going to work with each other and build up the state coalition.

275
00:26:32,682 --> 00:26:40,448
Now we have, I think what's different between now and in the past is we have better communication, better travel.

276
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:46,152
So it doesn't take us forever and a day to get across the country and communicate with other people.

277
00:26:46,873 --> 00:26:49,175
We have better messaging, better cooperation.

278
00:26:51,454 --> 00:27:02,018
Is the flip side of that digital surveillance of women in the form of like period tracking apps, sort of planned parent visits, whatever it may be, those feel like moments to attack women?

279
00:27:02,818 --> 00:27:03,198
They do.

280
00:27:04,258 --> 00:27:05,899
And so we're going to have to be

281
00:27:07,783 --> 00:27:26,690
You know, like I said, we're going to be very proactive about making sure that women are protected and I think the legislation that was recently passed here in Massachusetts is going to go, you know, good way towards that we need to work on education fronts to and let women know okay these services are safe.

282
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:30,011
and your information is not going to be shared.

283
00:27:30,391 --> 00:27:32,292
These services are not safe.

284
00:27:33,073 --> 00:27:46,478
I saw a great Facebook ad recently by Attorney General Maura Healey where she was talking about crisis pregnancy centers to get the word out that these are not going to give you accurate information.

285
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:49,580
These are not real reproductive health care centers.

286
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,621
They're just going to give you their biased view and that's it.

287
00:27:55,363 --> 00:27:57,667
We need to do better about protecting women.

288
00:27:58,208 --> 00:28:06,762
Again, that's an education piece legislatively making sure that we're not cooperating with other states who are demanding this information.

289
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:26,436
And then also making sure, I think this is going to come down to again, you know, a constitutional amendment, because if it's apparently, you know, even though the Bill of Rights says that your rights are not limited to what we've enumerated here, we just felt these needed to be specifically laid out.

290
00:28:27,416 --> 00:28:30,997
And even though that's what it says, apparently,

291
00:28:32,802 --> 00:28:43,768
That's what we're getting is just, it has to be said in language from the 1700s, which has like what to do with now.

292
00:28:43,948 --> 00:28:45,789
So we need to update.

293
00:28:46,029 --> 00:28:47,449
We need to update the document.

294
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:50,431
And so this is gonna be a long haul.

295
00:28:50,851 --> 00:28:52,232
People need to get on board with it.

296
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:56,254
Thank you.

297
00:28:57,755 --> 00:28:59,215
Really appreciate making the time for us.

298
00:28:59,396 --> 00:29:00,256
Shelley, any other questions?

299
00:29:01,886 --> 00:29:03,511
Thank you so much for being here.

300
00:29:03,531 --> 00:29:06,521
I really appreciate your energy.

301
00:29:07,424 --> 00:29:07,745
Thank you.

302
00:29:17,765 --> 00:29:18,906
Thanks to Nicole and Shelley.
