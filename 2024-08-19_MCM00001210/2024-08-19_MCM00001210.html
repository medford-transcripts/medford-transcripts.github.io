    <p>[Alvaro Sandoval]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=2.173">Somebody's</a>  playing something in the background. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=4.714">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=4.975">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=19.538">Just</a>  give me a second to read it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=23.34">Okay,</a>  so pursuant to Governor Baker's March 12th, 2020, order suspending certain provisions of the open meeting law, general law chapter 38, chapter 18, and the governor's March 15th, 2020, order imposing strict limitations <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=40.25">oops,</a>  on the number of people that may gather in one place. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=43.991">This</a>  meeting of the Medford License Commission will be conducted via remote participation to the greatest extent possible. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=52.633">Specific</a>  information, the general guidelines for remote participation by members of the public and or parties who are right and or requirement to attend this meeting can be found on the City of Medford website at www.medfordma.org. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=70.517">For</a>  this meeting, members of the public who wish to listen or watch the meeting may do so by accessing the meeting link contained herein, not in person attendance, no in person attendance of members of the public will be permitted. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=85.6">but</a>  every effort will be made to ensure that the public can adequately access the proceedings in real time via technological means. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=94.004">In</a>  the event that we're unable to do so despite the best efforts, we'll post on the city of Medford or the media community or media community media website an audio or video recording transcript or other comprehensive record of proceedings as soon as possible after the meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=115.392">That</a>  was small writing.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=116.572">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=117.073">Thank</a>  you, Daria. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=119.173">So</a>  the meeting will come to order and the first item on the agenda, Daria.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=128.437">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=128.677">So</a>  the first, second, it will be to approve minutes for March 17th, 2020 license commission meeting.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=136.959">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=142.141">I'd</a>  make a motion to approve the minutes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=144.885">As</a>  presented, I'll second that motion to approve those minutes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=154.113">All</a>  those in favor. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=154.793">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=158.797">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=160.898">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=161.839">Next</a>  will be a representative from the porch. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=167.772">will</a>  present an application for alteration of premises at their establishment located at 175 Rivers Edge Drive, Medford Mass. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=176.877">Is</a>  Jonathan on here?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=181.039">Anybody</a>  from the porch? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=184.201">Okay,</a>  we'll hold that one aside.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=185.942">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=187.163">The</a>  next one is Real Gusto.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=193.206">Anybody</a>  from Real Gusto? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=196.405">Okay,</a>  I guess we'll hold that one off to the side, Daria.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=198.866">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=201.188">Bistro</a>  5. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=205.61">Anybody</a>  from Bistro 5? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=206.711">Yeah,</a>  he's here.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=207.451">Nice</a>  to see you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=209.052">Good</a>  to see you guys.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=213.355">So</a>  we have your plan. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=214.435">Is</a>  your plan any different than what it was last year, Vito?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=223.48">Internet</a>  is a little spotty here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=230.255">Okay,</a>  might be better now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=233.376">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=234.337">Did</a>  you have a question?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=235.637">Yeah,</a>  it's just one question for me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=236.918">Is</a>  your plan any different than the one you presented last year?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=239.959">Same</a>  as last year, but last year we did have an issue with the barriers where we put a trellis. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=260.07">have</a>  to take those down. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=263.492">But</a>  we have to do something else this year to separate the dining hall from the barriers. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=270.497">So</a>  what we basically want to do now is put along the sidewalk, put basically just flowers, really. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=278.963">But</a>  the flowers would be just kind of like a continuous planter. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=285.495">But</a>  besides that, I'd say same exact spot.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=289.356">Same</a>  number of tables?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=291.316">Yeah,</a>  same number of tables.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=292.636">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=293.937">Yeah,</a>  that's it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=296.557">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=297.817">And</a>  I assume what you're working out with the trellis, you're working out with the building department or somebody else? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=307.379">I</a>  was saying the issue that you're having with the trellises, you're working that out with somebody at City Hall?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=313.584">Yes,</a>  I think the traffic commissioner was here, and I will be in Todd, actually, I think. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=321.749">And</a>  then, yeah, I will be talking to him about it, what I'm gonna plan on doing, so I can get it approved through him first, and then can go on with whatever. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=332.676">Fine.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=333.957">Yeah,</a>  because the main thing, we just need a little bit of privacy, really, you know, as long as, without obstructing any view, that's really it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=343.663">Understood,</a>  understood. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=345.764">I</a>  don't have any other questions.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=348.285">Yeah,</a>  no, I don't either. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=349.346">I'm</a>  looking over the application and I remember this from last year and I don't know that the trellis is really in our domain anyway to comment on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=358.97">So,</a>  I don't have any issues with the gym.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=361.412">Okay,</a>  so motion to approve the license for Bistro 5. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=364.393">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=367.955">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=368.795">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=369.675">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=371.156">All</a>  right, good luck. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=372.397">Good</a>  luck.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=373.647">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=374.528">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=376.609">You're</a>  welcome. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=377.11">Next</a>  on the agenda, Daria.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=386.398">Sorry</a>  guys. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=387.018">Didn't</a>  realize I was on mute. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=389.0">Um,</a>  next one is Bertucci's, but they have not sent me an application.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=392.863">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=393.964">And</a>  I send them a reminder last night as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=396.366">So</a>  I haven't received anything from them.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=398.628">That's</a>  fine.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=400.096">I</a>  think they might have outdoor dining, but I just got to check. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=402.818">I</a>  just haven't had the chance to come around it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=405.319">Yeah,</a>  Petucci's does have outdoor dining by means of their own regular permit.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=409.822">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=410.162">So</a>  with alcohol. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=411.723">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=411.904">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=412.204">So</a>  they're kind of like Regina's Pizza. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=413.665">So</a>  they're all set. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=414.445">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=415.026">That's</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=415.806">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=416.266">So</a>  we'll keep them out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=417.067">I</a>  kind of figured that, but wasn't 100% sure. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=418.908">That's</a>  okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=420.869">Next</a>  one is C-Bar. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=422.811">C-Bar?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=423.631">I'm</a>  sorry.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=423.931">C-Bar.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=430.923">Anybody</a>  present from SEBA? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=435.545">Hearing</a>  and seeing none, I guess we'll put that on hold.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=438.767">Yep,</a>  okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=441.769">Next</a>  one is FIORI Italy.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=444.01">FIORI</a>  Italy? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=446.291">Anybody</a>  present from FIORI Italy?</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=449.953">Yep,</a>  he's here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=451.033">He's</a>  just on mute. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=452.434">Andrea,</a>  you're on mute. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=455.215">You're</a>  gonna unmute yourself.</p>

    <p>[Alvaro Sandoval]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=696.697">We</a>  did not apply last year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=698.497">We</a>  did not have any other city.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=700.998">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=701.678">How</a>  many tables do you have under this scenario?</p>

    <p>[Alvaro Sandoval]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=704.619">We</a>  have, we applying for three on each of the parking spots. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=709.32">So</a>  we're looking to have two parking spots and then two tables on each side of the windows. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=715.821">Fine.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=716.661">So,</a>  so eight? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=719.042">So</a>  there will be three, six, eight. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=720.802">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=722.243">Has</a>  the city approved the two parking spaces? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=726.093">I</a>  submit the application and this is what I have first. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=730.235">I</a>  think this meeting, I'm still waiting on them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=733.036">That's</a>  fine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=733.456">Do</a>  we know anything about that Daria?</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=735.817">I'm</a>  not sure Miranda.</p>

    <p>[Miranda Briseno]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=737.938">Yeah,</a>  we're reviewing tomorrow internally. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=740.98">But</a>  yeah, so far, I haven't heard any issues from transportation on the parking places.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=748.551">So</a>  far, so good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=749.912">So</a>  Alvaro, the only thing is we'd like to have the city on board before we issue the permit for the outdoor dining. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=756.195">We</a>  just don't want to give you a permit for the outdoor dining and then find out the city, I'm not suggesting they do, that they have a... So my suggestion for getting around it, in the future diary, we should make sure that the city's on board with every application before they come before us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=770.882">And</a>  I understand we're trying to move this on a fast pace for everybody, and I get that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=775.944">Um,</a>  so my suggestion is we approve it subject to the city and the traffic department approving or ever else Miranda has to do that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=784.87">Um,</a>  you know, being on board with that, if that's okay with you, Alvaro. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=788.172">Yeah,</a>  that's totally fine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=789.633">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=789.913">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=791.034">So,</a>  um, so we'll do this, uh, approval subject to, uh, diarrhea, getting confirmation from the city, um, that they've approved the two parking spaces being dedicated for your outdoor dining. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=803.603">That</a>  okay, Ben.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=805.177">Yeah,</a>  that makes sense. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=806.558">That's</a>  what I think we had to do last year a couple times. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=809.859">So</a>  this is kind of the same for you since this is your first year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=813.261">So</a>  that's, but I'm in favor of it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=816.363">Uh,</a>  yeah, as long as you can get all the barriers up and in place and it's just safe for all your, um, customers, that seems, seems great.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=822.906">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=824.106">So</a>  a motion to approve the, um, the outdoor dining license for, uh, uh, Tanosh would be an order all those in favor. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=833.031">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=833.728">I,</a>  again, Daria is subject to the city's approval, okay?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=837.31">I</a>  just have one very important question though. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=839.271">Is</a>  it Tanach or is it Tanach? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=842.033">Tanach.</a> </p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=843.093">Tanach.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=843.413">Tanach,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=845.094">Good</a>  to know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=846.195">Debate</a>  at my house.</p>

    <p>[Alvaro Sandoval]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=849.437">I</a>  love it too. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=852.058">Thank</a>  you, that sounds good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=853.619">Thank</a>  you guys and be safe. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=855.78">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=856.02">Thank</a>  you, you too. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=856.961">Thank</a>  you, Alvaro. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=857.761">Bye.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=858.502">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=860.363">Next</a>  on the agenda.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=861.405">Well,</a>  that's it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=863.046">We</a>  have a couple more people on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=865.968">We</a>  have three people on, but I have no idea where they're from. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=870.912">Can</a>  you guys let us know whoever is on?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=872.933">I'm</a>  from Sabar, Mexico.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=874.574">Yeah,</a>  Sabar, okay.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=875.815">Oh,</a>  Sabar, okay, hold on.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=877.336">Yeah,</a>  so go back to the Sabar one.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=882.6">Do</a>  you have that application, Daria?</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=884.78">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=885.56">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=886.54">So,</a>  say bar is your outdoor dining plan, any different than it was last year.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=892.462">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=893.482">Same</a>  number of tables. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=895.002">Yeah,</a>  they remember tables. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=897.483">And</a>  I assume in every one of these instances diary I'm making an assumption. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=902.264">And</a>  maybe I shouldn't make the assumption that the city is signed off on all of these that we're looking at.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=907.977">They're</a>  gonna, so like Miranda said, we're gonna talk about it, all of us tomorrow. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=913.261">And</a>  then I think we're gonna probably hear back on the approval next week, but I'm not gonna issue anything till we get a final approval from the mayor.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=921.406">Well,</a>  I thought we scheduled these meetings so that it was subsequent to the city's decision.</p>

    <p>[Miranda Briseno]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=927.83">This</a>  week was a weird one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=929.091">We</a>  wanted to meet before you guys did, but half of our team was busy. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=934.155">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=935.235">But</a>  we've been talking and I don't think they're, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=938.543">I</a>  would have flagged anything for you all.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=940.163">I</a>  got it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=940.644">I</a>  got it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=941.384">So</a>  I think the only thing diary is I don't want to hold these public hearings and inconvenience the customers and think they have a license when in fact, you know, it's preemptive, it could be preempted by the city's action. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=955.288">So</a>  let's in the future, unless there's something happening on the day, you know, let's hold until the city approves. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=963.138">Um,</a>  all of the, um, barricades and whatever's necessary, and then we take our action. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=969.08">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=969.3">So</a>  just to be consistent, what we will do with say bar is what we've done with the prior, uh, applicants as well as we will hold all of the applications today, pending approval, uh, of the city by the city. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=984.045">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=986.166">And</a>  the city should notify you if there's an issue, uh, before next week diary. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=990.707">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Miranda Briseno]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=991.328">Yep.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=992.088">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=993.786">Ben,</a>  any questions for Saba?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=996.527">No.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=996.787">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=1001.149">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=1001.869">I</a>  have no further questions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=1002.87">A</a>  motion to approve would be an order. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=1005.151">All</a>  those in favor. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=1007.452">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=1007.872">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=1008.832">Opposed.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=1009.292">None.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=1010.453">Your</a>  license has been approved subject to the city approving your outdoor dining plan.</p>

    <p>[Alvaro Sandoval]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=1015.255">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=1016.155">You're</a>  welcome.</p>

    <p>[Alvaro Sandoval]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=1017.116">Thank</a>  you, sir.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=1017.936">Good</a>  luck. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=1019.116">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=1020.197">Good</a>  luck. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=1021.463">Next</a>  on the agenda, going back to the agenda, Daria. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=1026.404">Those</a>  that weren't here before. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=1029.305">Stephen</a>  Napolitano. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=1031.386">Hi,</a>  yes, Stephen Napolitano. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=1036.507">Daria,</a>  email.</p>

    <p>[Miranda Briseno]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=1037.547">I</a>  can't hear you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=1039.368">Can</a>  you hear me? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=1040.368">Yes,</a>  now I can. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=1041.308">Yeah,</a>  now we can. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=1043.029">With</a>  Pizzeria Regina. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=1045.439">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Alvaro Sandoval]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=1046.259">At</a>  44 station landing, I had emailed Daria just want to make sure that everything is all set.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=1052.303">Yes,</a>  yes, you're all set. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=1054.103">So</a>  you have outdoor dining already as part of your license. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=1057.265">That</a>  is correct.</p>

    <p>[Miranda Briseno]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=1058.125">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=1058.486">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=1058.906">So</a>  you are all set. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=1060.006">I</a>  thank you for coming to this meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=1061.947">But</a>  there's no need. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=1063.708">Thank</a>  you for participating. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=1065.129">Yes,</a>  you're all set. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=1066.45">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=1067.43">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=1068.731">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=1070.512">So</a>  then we're just to go back. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=1072.893">Who</a>  wasn't here that was on your agenda? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=1074.734">Could</a>  you just <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=1076.125">We</a>  just talked about those names?</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=1077.986">Yeah,</a>  it was the Porch, Real Gusto, Bistro 5 we had.</p>

    <p>[Miranda Briseno]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=1084.17">Real</a>  Gusto, they're not doing an outdoor dining setup. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=1087.932">They're</a>  just using their balconies, I believe, this year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=1092.615">They're</a>  not going to do any parking spaces or outdoor dining. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=1095.397">So</a>  it'll be like private premises.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=1098.031">Oh,</a>  I think, Miranda, I think they did the same thing last year, but they still had to come in front of us.</p>

    <p>[Miranda Briseno]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=1105.178">Sorry,</a>  I was just letting you guys know.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=1107.299">Yeah,</a>  because he did reach out to me and I told him that he still has to fill out the application and he did, so I don't know why he didn't.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=1115.006">And</a>  the reason for him filling out the application is because what he's licensed for,</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=1119.933">It's</a>  just inside, yeah.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=1121.433">Right,</a>  just inside.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-04-08-21&start=1122.013">And</a>  I explained that to him, like, yeah.</p>
