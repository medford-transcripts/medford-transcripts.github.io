1
00:00:00,491 --> 00:00:02,153
So, Daria, if you could read the preamble.

2
00:00:02,173 --> 00:00:04,694
Somebody's playing something in the background.

3
00:00:04,714 --> 00:00:04,914
Okay.

4
00:00:04,975 --> 00:00:05,275
All right.

5
00:00:19,538 --> 00:00:23,160
Just give me a second to read it.

6
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:39,290
Okay, so pursuant to Governor Baker's March 12th, 2020, order suspending certain provisions of the open meeting law, general law chapter 38, chapter 18, and the governor's March 15th, 2020, order imposing strict limitations

7
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,391
oops, on the number of people that may gather in one place.

8
00:00:43,991 --> 00:00:52,533
This meeting of the Medford License Commission will be conducted via remote participation to the greatest extent possible.

9
00:00:52,633 --> 00:01:08,597
Specific information, the general guidelines for remote participation by members of the public and or parties who are right and or requirement to attend this meeting can be found on the City of Medford website at www.medfordma.org.

10
00:01:10,517 --> 00:01:24,859
For this meeting, members of the public who wish to listen or watch the meeting may do so by accessing the meeting link contained herein, not in person attendance, no in person attendance of members of the public will be permitted.

11
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:33,703
but every effort will be made to ensure that the public can adequately access the proceedings in real time via technological means.

12
00:01:34,004 --> 00:01:53,692
In the event that we're unable to do so despite the best efforts, we'll post on the city of Medford or the media community or media community media website an audio or video recording transcript or other comprehensive record of proceedings as soon as possible after the meeting.

13
00:01:55,392 --> 00:01:56,132
That was small writing.

14
00:01:56,572 --> 00:01:56,933
Thank you.

15
00:01:57,073 --> 00:01:57,733
Thank you, Daria.

16
00:01:59,173 --> 00:02:06,496
So the meeting will come to order and the first item on the agenda, Daria.

17
00:02:08,437 --> 00:02:08,657
Okay.

18
00:02:08,677 --> 00:02:16,939
So the first, second, it will be to approve minutes for March 17th, 2020 license commission meeting.

19
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,161
Okay.

20
00:02:22,141 --> 00:02:23,702
I'd make a motion to approve the minutes.

21
00:02:24,885 --> 00:02:29,029
As presented, I'll second that motion to approve those minutes.

22
00:02:34,113 --> 00:02:34,773
All those in favor.

23
00:02:34,793 --> 00:02:37,896
Hi.

24
00:02:38,797 --> 00:02:39,097
Okay.

25
00:02:40,898 --> 00:02:41,179
Thank you.

26
00:02:41,839 --> 00:02:46,223
Next will be a representative from the porch.

27
00:02:47,772 --> 00:02:54,996
will present an application for alteration of premises at their establishment located at 175 Rivers Edge Drive, Medford Mass.

28
00:02:56,877 --> 00:02:57,918
Is Jonathan on here?

29
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:01,900
Anybody from the porch?

30
00:03:04,201 --> 00:03:05,382
Okay, we'll hold that one aside.

31
00:03:05,942 --> 00:03:06,202
Okay.

32
00:03:07,163 --> 00:03:09,925
The next one is Real Gusto.

33
00:03:13,206 --> 00:03:14,227
Anybody from Real Gusto?

34
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:18,306
Okay, I guess we'll hold that one off to the side, Daria.

35
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:20,607
Okay.

36
00:03:21,188 --> 00:03:22,008
Bistro 5.

37
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:26,611
Anybody from Bistro 5?

38
00:03:26,711 --> 00:03:27,431
Yeah, he's here.

39
00:03:27,451 --> 00:03:29,032
Nice to see you.

40
00:03:29,052 --> 00:03:31,033
Good to see you guys.

41
00:03:33,355 --> 00:03:34,395
So we have your plan.

42
00:03:34,435 --> 00:03:37,037
Is your plan any different than what it was last year, Vito?

43
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,841
Internet is a little spotty here.

44
00:03:50,255 --> 00:03:52,716
Okay, might be better now.

45
00:03:53,376 --> 00:03:54,317
Thank you.

46
00:03:54,337 --> 00:03:55,137
Did you have a question?

47
00:03:55,637 --> 00:03:56,858
Yeah, it's just one question for me.

48
00:03:56,918 --> 00:03:59,939
Is your plan any different than the one you presented last year?

49
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:17,166
Same as last year, but last year we did have an issue with the barriers where we put a trellis.

50
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:22,732
have to take those down.

51
00:04:23,492 --> 00:04:30,417
But we have to do something else this year to separate the dining hall from the barriers.

52
00:04:30,497 --> 00:04:37,622
So what we basically want to do now is put along the sidewalk, put basically just flowers, really.

53
00:04:38,963 --> 00:04:42,926
But the flowers would be just kind of like a continuous planter.

54
00:04:45,495 --> 00:04:47,855
But besides that, I'd say same exact spot.

55
00:04:49,356 --> 00:04:50,256
Same number of tables?

56
00:04:51,316 --> 00:04:52,576
Yeah, same number of tables.

57
00:04:52,636 --> 00:04:52,996
Thank you.

58
00:04:53,937 --> 00:04:56,517
Yeah, that's it.

59
00:04:56,557 --> 00:04:56,857
Okay.

60
00:04:57,817 --> 00:05:05,799
And I assume what you're working out with the trellis, you're working out with the building department or somebody else?

61
00:05:07,379 --> 00:05:12,280
I was saying the issue that you're having with the trellises, you're working that out with somebody at City Hall?

62
00:05:13,584 --> 00:05:21,089
Yes, I think the traffic commissioner was here, and I will be in Todd, actually, I think.

63
00:05:21,749 --> 00:05:32,656
And then, yeah, I will be talking to him about it, what I'm gonna plan on doing, so I can get it approved through him first, and then can go on with whatever.

64
00:05:32,676 --> 00:05:33,737
Fine.

65
00:05:33,957 --> 00:05:42,202
Yeah, because the main thing, we just need a little bit of privacy, really, you know, as long as, without obstructing any view, that's really it.

66
00:05:43,663 --> 00:05:45,724
Understood, understood.

67
00:05:45,764 --> 00:05:46,765
I don't have any other questions.

68
00:05:48,285 --> 00:05:49,326
Yeah, no, I don't either.

69
00:05:49,346 --> 00:05:58,030
I'm looking over the application and I remember this from last year and I don't know that the trellis is really in our domain anyway to comment on.

70
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:00,711
So, I don't have any issues with the gym.

71
00:06:01,412 --> 00:06:04,253
Okay, so motion to approve the license for Bistro 5.

72
00:06:04,393 --> 00:06:06,274
All those in favor?

73
00:06:07,955 --> 00:06:08,515
Aye.

74
00:06:08,795 --> 00:06:08,915
Aye.

75
00:06:09,675 --> 00:06:10,516
Thank you.

76
00:06:11,156 --> 00:06:11,837
All right, good luck.

77
00:06:12,397 --> 00:06:12,717
Good luck.

78
00:06:13,647 --> 00:06:14,248
Thank you so much.

79
00:06:14,528 --> 00:06:15,248
Thank you.

80
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:17,070
You're welcome.

81
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,491
Next on the agenda, Daria.

82
00:06:26,398 --> 00:06:26,838
Sorry guys.

83
00:06:27,018 --> 00:06:28,259
Didn't realize I was on mute.

84
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,843
Um, next one is Bertucci's, but they have not sent me an application.

85
00:06:32,863 --> 00:06:33,784
Okay.

86
00:06:33,964 --> 00:06:36,286
And I send them a reminder last night as well.

87
00:06:36,366 --> 00:06:38,167
So I haven't received anything from them.

88
00:06:38,628 --> 00:06:39,048
That's fine.

89
00:06:40,096 --> 00:06:42,778
I think they might have outdoor dining, but I just got to check.

90
00:06:42,818 --> 00:06:44,639
I just haven't had the chance to come around it.

91
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:49,262
Yeah, Petucci's does have outdoor dining by means of their own regular permit.

92
00:06:49,822 --> 00:06:50,142
Okay.

93
00:06:50,162 --> 00:06:51,163
So with alcohol.

94
00:06:51,723 --> 00:06:51,864
Right.

95
00:06:51,904 --> 00:06:52,184
Okay.

96
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:53,625
So they're kind of like Regina's Pizza.

97
00:06:53,665 --> 00:06:54,385
So they're all set.

98
00:06:54,445 --> 00:06:54,705
Right.

99
00:06:55,026 --> 00:06:55,406
That's right.

100
00:06:55,806 --> 00:06:56,126
Okay.

101
00:06:56,266 --> 00:06:56,967
So we'll keep them out.

102
00:06:57,067 --> 00:06:58,868
I kind of figured that, but wasn't 100% sure.

103
00:06:58,908 --> 00:07:00,209
That's okay.

104
00:07:00,869 --> 00:07:02,590
Next one is C-Bar.

105
00:07:02,811 --> 00:07:03,231
C-Bar?

106
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:03,911
I'm sorry.

107
00:07:03,931 --> 00:07:04,311
C-Bar.

108
00:07:04,912 --> 00:07:05,052
Yep.

109
00:07:06,053 --> 00:07:06,233
Yep.

110
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:08,034
Anybody from C-Bar?

111
00:07:10,923 --> 00:07:12,244
Anybody present from SEBA?

112
00:07:15,545 --> 00:07:17,967
Hearing and seeing none, I guess we'll put that on hold.

113
00:07:18,767 --> 00:07:20,008
Yep, okay.

114
00:07:21,769 --> 00:07:23,229
Next one is FIORI Italy.

115
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:24,690
FIORI Italy?

116
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:27,852
Anybody present from FIORI Italy?

117
00:07:29,953 --> 00:07:30,713
Yep, he's here.

118
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:31,714
He's just on mute.

119
00:07:32,434 --> 00:07:33,434
Andrea, you're on mute.

120
00:07:35,215 --> 00:07:36,136
You're gonna unmute yourself.

121
00:07:38,337 --> 00:07:38,677
Okay.

122
00:07:39,177 --> 00:07:40,058
Okay, thank you.

123
00:07:42,737 --> 00:07:49,321
Just a question as I asked the prior petitioner, is there any change from your outdoor dining plan than what it was last year?

124
00:07:50,542 --> 00:07:52,843
No, it's the same, the same.

125
00:07:52,943 --> 00:07:53,144
Gotcha.

126
00:07:54,284 --> 00:07:58,227
Okay, have the barricades been installed already for you?

127
00:07:59,247 --> 00:07:59,427
No.

128
00:08:00,028 --> 00:08:01,068
Okay, all right.

129
00:08:02,609 --> 00:08:04,070
All right, so same plan as last year?

130
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:08,453
Yeah, we have a lot of people calling that if they can sit outside.

131
00:08:09,013 --> 00:08:11,775
Right, hopefully the weather stays in our favor to do that.

132
00:08:12,281 --> 00:08:13,782
Yeah, we deserve it.

133
00:08:14,323 --> 00:08:14,803
Yeah, you do.

134
00:08:15,143 --> 00:08:15,884
No question about it.

135
00:08:15,964 --> 00:08:17,645
No, I mean, everyone, everyone deserves it.

136
00:08:17,785 --> 00:08:18,286
No, I know.

137
00:08:18,606 --> 00:08:19,166
I know what you mean.

138
00:08:19,527 --> 00:08:20,007
We all do.

139
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:21,488
Everybody needs a break.

140
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:21,928
I get it.

141
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:23,290
Especially from this COVID.

142
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:24,350
Of course.

143
00:08:26,352 --> 00:08:27,393
I don't have any other questions.

144
00:08:27,873 --> 00:08:34,298
No, we just met about the premises and we're familiar with that and how that worked out last year.

145
00:08:34,358 --> 00:08:36,700
And so same as Jim.

146
00:08:38,373 --> 00:08:42,817
I would make, Jim, I'd make a motion to accept the alteration of premises here.

147
00:08:43,998 --> 00:08:44,158
Yep.

148
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:45,659
So all those in favor.

149
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,981
I oppose none.

150
00:08:48,722 --> 00:08:49,863
Your license has been granted.

151
00:08:51,244 --> 00:08:51,585
Very good.

152
00:08:51,645 --> 00:08:52,606
Thank you very much.

153
00:08:52,986 --> 00:08:53,386
Thank you.

154
00:08:53,406 --> 00:08:54,527
Thanks.

155
00:08:55,088 --> 00:08:58,291
The next one is Carol's Carol's restaurant.

156
00:08:58,331 --> 00:08:58,571
Maury.

157
00:08:58,591 --> 00:08:59,111
Good afternoon.

158
00:09:01,513 --> 00:09:03,235
Mary, Mary, you got to unmute yourself.

159
00:09:10,429 --> 00:09:11,169
Mari, you're on mute.

160
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:12,911
There we go.

161
00:09:12,991 --> 00:09:14,191
Now you got it.

162
00:09:14,812 --> 00:09:15,532
How are we doing today?

163
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:16,433
Good, thanks.

164
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:16,993
How are you doing?

165
00:09:17,393 --> 00:09:18,394
Doing well, thanks, Jimmy.

166
00:09:18,874 --> 00:09:19,355
That's good.

167
00:09:20,395 --> 00:09:22,957
Mari, just the same question I had for the prior petitioners.

168
00:09:24,118 --> 00:09:26,079
Any change in your outdoor dining plan?

169
00:09:26,619 --> 00:09:28,120
Everything's going to be the exact same.

170
00:09:28,981 --> 00:09:29,661
Thank you very much.

171
00:09:30,962 --> 00:09:32,003
I have no further questions.

172
00:09:33,303 --> 00:09:34,604
No, I remember it last year.

173
00:09:34,944 --> 00:09:36,165
No, there's no issues with that.

174
00:09:36,485 --> 00:09:37,686
You guys had it along the bridge.

175
00:09:38,066 --> 00:09:38,987
When will you start it, Mari?

176
00:09:39,949 --> 00:09:41,769
Uh, I think we can start on the 15th.

177
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:42,790
So I wasn't permitting.

178
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:44,210
Okay, good.

179
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:45,950
All right.

180
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:50,571
Uh, I'll make a motion to approve the license as presented all in favor.

181
00:09:51,111 --> 00:09:51,271
Yep.

182
00:09:52,431 --> 00:09:52,711
Okay.

183
00:09:53,511 --> 00:09:53,671
Good.

184
00:09:53,691 --> 00:09:53,951
Mari.

185
00:09:53,971 --> 00:09:54,532
Good luck to you.

186
00:09:55,572 --> 00:09:57,132
Thank you very much.

187
00:09:57,612 --> 00:09:58,472
Nice to see you as well.

188
00:09:58,612 --> 00:09:58,972
Thank you.

189
00:10:00,273 --> 00:10:05,273
Next one is Salvatore's anybody from Salvatore is present.

190
00:10:06,034 --> 00:10:07,014
Thank you, Denise.

191
00:10:10,194 --> 00:10:11,515
Denise, same question as before.

192
00:10:12,035 --> 00:10:14,215
Any change from the outdoor dining from last year?

193
00:10:14,235 --> 00:10:15,676
Same number of tables?

194
00:10:15,976 --> 00:10:16,616
Everything's the same.

195
00:10:16,976 --> 00:10:17,697
That makes it easy.

196
00:10:17,877 --> 00:10:18,557
Thank you very much.

197
00:10:19,217 --> 00:10:19,957
Thank you.

198
00:10:20,417 --> 00:10:21,238
Ben, any questions?

199
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:24,079
No, I was just looking for the Salvatore's application.

200
00:10:24,119 --> 00:10:24,639
Is it in there?

201
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:29,400
Yes, it should be, yep.

202
00:10:30,801 --> 00:10:32,521
Okay.

203
00:10:33,922 --> 00:10:34,502
No, I don't.

204
00:10:34,642 --> 00:10:35,942
And it's in the back still?

205
00:10:35,962 --> 00:10:36,022
Yep.

206
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:40,485
Yeah, just waiting for the barriers from the city.

207
00:10:40,986 --> 00:10:41,226
Yeah.

208
00:10:43,247 --> 00:10:45,269
No, seems like a good place for it again.

209
00:10:45,329 --> 00:10:47,611
And, uh, I don't have any further questions on it.

210
00:10:48,211 --> 00:10:54,375
Great motion to approve the, uh, license for Salvatore's would be an order all those in favor.

211
00:10:56,097 --> 00:10:56,317
Great.

212
00:10:56,737 --> 00:10:57,097
Thank you.

213
00:10:57,498 --> 00:10:58,258
Thank you, Denise.

214
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:00,040
Good luck.

215
00:11:02,341 --> 00:11:02,601
Okay.

216
00:11:02,641 --> 00:11:05,984
Next one is Asian taste, Asian taste.

217
00:11:08,138 --> 00:11:12,500
Anybody from Asian Taste wants to speak on behalf of the license?

218
00:11:15,181 --> 00:11:16,222
Nobody from Asian Taste?

219
00:11:16,402 --> 00:11:17,802
Okay, we'll put that one aside, Daria.

220
00:11:18,202 --> 00:11:19,663
Okay, and then Tanak?

221
00:11:21,104 --> 00:11:22,084
I know Alvaro's on.

222
00:11:22,424 --> 00:11:22,804
Yup, Tanak.

223
00:11:22,844 --> 00:11:22,965
Yup.

224
00:11:23,325 --> 00:11:23,745
Alvaro?

225
00:11:24,365 --> 00:11:24,765
Alvaro?

226
00:11:24,845 --> 00:11:25,806
Can't hear you, hold on.

227
00:11:25,946 --> 00:11:26,466
You're on mute.

228
00:11:26,726 --> 00:11:27,446
Yup, thank you.

229
00:11:29,007 --> 00:11:30,928
Alvaro, same question as the prior petition.

230
00:11:30,968 --> 00:11:35,210
Is any change in your outdoor seating capacity than it was last year?

231
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:38,157
We did not apply last year.

232
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:39,898
We did not have any other city.

233
00:11:40,998 --> 00:11:41,358
Thank you.

234
00:11:41,678 --> 00:11:43,298
How many tables do you have under this scenario?

235
00:11:44,619 --> 00:11:49,300
We have, we applying for three on each of the parking spots.

236
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:54,341
So we're looking to have two parking spots and then two tables on each side of the windows.

237
00:11:55,821 --> 00:11:56,081
Fine.

238
00:11:56,661 --> 00:11:57,642
So, so eight?

239
00:11:59,042 --> 00:12:00,682
So there will be three, six, eight.

240
00:12:00,802 --> 00:12:00,982
Yes.

241
00:12:02,243 --> 00:12:04,043
Has the city approved the two parking spaces?

242
00:12:06,093 --> 00:12:10,175
I submit the application and this is what I have first.

243
00:12:10,235 --> 00:12:12,356
I think this meeting, I'm still waiting on them.

244
00:12:13,036 --> 00:12:13,436
That's fine.

245
00:12:13,456 --> 00:12:14,857
Do we know anything about that Daria?

246
00:12:15,817 --> 00:12:17,718
I'm not sure Miranda.

247
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:20,360
Yeah, we're reviewing tomorrow internally.

248
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:27,523
But yeah, so far, I haven't heard any issues from transportation on the parking places.

249
00:12:28,551 --> 00:12:29,291
So far, so good.

250
00:12:29,912 --> 00:12:35,754
So Alvaro, the only thing is we'd like to have the city on board before we issue the permit for the outdoor dining.

251
00:12:36,195 --> 00:12:50,421
We just don't want to give you a permit for the outdoor dining and then find out the city, I'm not suggesting they do, that they have a... So my suggestion for getting around it, in the future diary, we should make sure that the city's on board with every application before they come before us.

252
00:12:50,882 --> 00:12:55,124
And I understand we're trying to move this on a fast pace for everybody, and I get that.

253
00:12:55,944 --> 00:13:04,110
Um, so my suggestion is we approve it subject to the city and the traffic department approving or ever else Miranda has to do that.

254
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:07,592
Um, you know, being on board with that, if that's okay with you, Alvaro.

255
00:13:08,172 --> 00:13:09,353
Yeah, that's totally fine.

256
00:13:09,633 --> 00:13:09,793
Yeah.

257
00:13:09,913 --> 00:13:10,194
Okay.

258
00:13:11,034 --> 00:13:22,602
So, um, so we'll do this, uh, approval subject to, uh, diarrhea, getting confirmation from the city, um, that they've approved the two parking spaces being dedicated for your outdoor dining.

259
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:24,143
That okay, Ben.

260
00:13:25,177 --> 00:13:25,877
Yeah, that makes sense.

261
00:13:26,558 --> 00:13:29,459
That's what I think we had to do last year a couple times.

262
00:13:29,859 --> 00:13:33,221
So this is kind of the same for you since this is your first year.

263
00:13:33,261 --> 00:13:35,482
So that's, but I'm in favor of it.

264
00:13:36,363 --> 00:13:42,346
Uh, yeah, as long as you can get all the barriers up and in place and it's just safe for all your, um, customers, that seems, seems great.

265
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:43,086
Yep.

266
00:13:44,106 --> 00:13:51,430
So a motion to approve the, um, the outdoor dining license for, uh, uh, Tanosh would be an order all those in favor.

267
00:13:53,031 --> 00:13:53,111
Hi.

268
00:13:53,728 --> 00:13:56,490
I, again, Daria is subject to the city's approval, okay?

269
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:59,171
I just have one very important question though.

270
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:01,312
Is it Tanach or is it Tanach?

271
00:14:02,033 --> 00:14:02,433
Tanach.

272
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:03,393
Tanach.

273
00:14:03,413 --> 00:14:05,014
Tanach, yeah.

274
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:05,595
Good to know.

275
00:14:06,195 --> 00:14:06,955
Debate at my house.

276
00:14:09,437 --> 00:14:10,757
I love it too.

277
00:14:12,058 --> 00:14:13,179
Thank you, that sounds good.

278
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:15,380
Thank you guys and be safe.

279
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:16,000
Thank you.

280
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:16,701
Thank you, you too.

281
00:14:16,961 --> 00:14:17,721
Thank you, Alvaro.

282
00:14:17,761 --> 00:14:17,901
Bye.

283
00:14:18,502 --> 00:14:18,882
Thank you.

284
00:14:20,363 --> 00:14:21,123
Next on the agenda.

285
00:14:21,405 --> 00:14:22,866
Well, that's it.

286
00:14:23,046 --> 00:14:25,248
We have a couple more people on.

287
00:14:25,968 --> 00:14:30,852
We have three people on, but I have no idea where they're from.

288
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:32,593
Can you guys let us know whoever is on?

289
00:14:32,933 --> 00:14:34,334
I'm from Sabar, Mexico.

290
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:35,655
Yeah, Sabar, okay.

291
00:14:35,815 --> 00:14:37,036
Oh, Sabar, okay, hold on.

292
00:14:37,336 --> 00:14:39,878
Yeah, so go back to the Sabar one.

293
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,121
Do you have that application, Daria?

294
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:45,000
Yes.

295
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:45,860
Okay.

296
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:51,742
So, say bar is your outdoor dining plan, any different than it was last year.

297
00:14:52,462 --> 00:14:52,622
No.

298
00:14:53,482 --> 00:14:54,342
Same number of tables.

299
00:14:55,002 --> 00:14:56,683
Yeah, they remember tables.

300
00:14:57,483 --> 00:15:01,584
And I assume in every one of these instances diary I'm making an assumption.

301
00:15:02,264 --> 00:15:06,745
And maybe I shouldn't make the assumption that the city is signed off on all of these that we're looking at.

302
00:15:07,977 --> 00:15:13,020
They're gonna, so like Miranda said, we're gonna talk about it, all of us tomorrow.

303
00:15:13,261 --> 00:15:20,966
And then I think we're gonna probably hear back on the approval next week, but I'm not gonna issue anything till we get a final approval from the mayor.

304
00:15:21,406 --> 00:15:25,169
Well, I thought we scheduled these meetings so that it was subsequent to the city's decision.

305
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,071
This week was a weird one.

306
00:15:29,091 --> 00:15:33,574
We wanted to meet before you guys did, but half of our team was busy.

307
00:15:34,155 --> 00:15:34,515
Okay.

308
00:15:35,235 --> 00:15:37,397
But we've been talking and I don't think they're,

309
00:15:38,543 --> 00:15:40,023
I would have flagged anything for you all.

310
00:15:40,163 --> 00:15:40,504
I got it.

311
00:15:40,644 --> 00:15:41,044
I got it.

312
00:15:41,384 --> 00:15:54,508
So I think the only thing diary is I don't want to hold these public hearings and inconvenience the customers and think they have a license when in fact, you know, it's preemptive, it could be preempted by the city's action.

313
00:15:55,288 --> 00:16:02,030
So let's in the future, unless there's something happening on the day, you know, let's hold until the city approves.

314
00:16:03,138 --> 00:16:08,420
Um, all of the, um, barricades and whatever's necessary, and then we take our action.

315
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:09,280
Okay.

316
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:22,485
So just to be consistent, what we will do with say bar is what we've done with the prior, uh, applicants as well as we will hold all of the applications today, pending approval, uh, of the city by the city.

317
00:16:24,045 --> 00:16:24,325
Okay.

318
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:30,647
And the city should notify you if there's an issue, uh, before next week diary.

319
00:16:30,707 --> 00:16:30,988
Okay.

320
00:16:31,328 --> 00:16:31,488
Yep.

321
00:16:32,088 --> 00:16:32,288
Okay.

322
00:16:33,786 --> 00:16:35,267
Ben, any questions for Saba?

323
00:16:36,527 --> 00:16:36,767
No.

324
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:38,108
Yeah.

325
00:16:41,149 --> 00:16:41,449
All right.

326
00:16:41,869 --> 00:16:42,830
I have no further questions.

327
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:44,450
A motion to approve would be an order.

328
00:16:45,151 --> 00:16:45,871
All those in favor.

329
00:16:47,452 --> 00:16:47,552
Aye.

330
00:16:47,872 --> 00:16:47,992
Aye.

331
00:16:48,832 --> 00:16:49,232
Opposed.

332
00:16:49,292 --> 00:16:49,512
None.

333
00:16:50,453 --> 00:16:54,635
Your license has been approved subject to the city approving your outdoor dining plan.

334
00:16:55,255 --> 00:16:55,595
Thank you.

335
00:16:56,155 --> 00:16:56,635
You're welcome.

336
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:57,536
Thank you, sir.

337
00:16:57,936 --> 00:16:58,476
Good luck.

338
00:16:59,116 --> 00:16:59,276
Yep.

339
00:17:00,197 --> 00:17:00,497
Good luck.

340
00:17:01,463 --> 00:17:04,164
Next on the agenda, going back to the agenda, Daria.

341
00:17:06,404 --> 00:17:07,805
Those that weren't here before.

342
00:17:09,305 --> 00:17:10,845
Stephen Napolitano.

343
00:17:11,386 --> 00:17:16,467
Hi, yes, Stephen Napolitano.

344
00:17:16,507 --> 00:17:17,467
Daria, email.

345
00:17:17,547 --> 00:17:18,147
I can't hear you.

346
00:17:19,368 --> 00:17:20,108
Can you hear me?

347
00:17:20,368 --> 00:17:21,108
Yes, now I can.

348
00:17:21,308 --> 00:17:22,048
Yeah, now we can.

349
00:17:23,029 --> 00:17:24,249
With Pizzeria Regina.

350
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:25,759
Okay.

351
00:17:26,259 --> 00:17:32,202
At 44 station landing, I had emailed Daria just want to make sure that everything is all set.

352
00:17:32,303 --> 00:17:33,423
Yes, yes, you're all set.

353
00:17:34,103 --> 00:17:36,845
So you have outdoor dining already as part of your license.

354
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:37,925
That is correct.

355
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:38,386
Yes.

356
00:17:38,486 --> 00:17:38,686
Yeah.

357
00:17:38,906 --> 00:17:39,766
So you are all set.

358
00:17:40,006 --> 00:17:41,487
I thank you for coming to this meeting.

359
00:17:41,947 --> 00:17:43,188
But there's no need.

360
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:44,869
Thank you for participating.

361
00:17:45,129 --> 00:17:45,949
Yes, you're all set.

362
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:46,890
Thank you.

363
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:47,850
Thank you.

364
00:17:48,731 --> 00:17:49,151
Thank you.

365
00:17:50,512 --> 00:17:52,553
So then we're just to go back.

366
00:17:52,893 --> 00:17:54,694
Who wasn't here that was on your agenda?

367
00:17:54,734 --> 00:17:55,094
Could you just

368
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:57,226
We just talked about those names?

369
00:17:57,986 --> 00:18:04,150
Yeah, it was the Porch, Real Gusto, Bistro 5 we had.

370
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:07,872
Real Gusto, they're not doing an outdoor dining setup.

371
00:18:07,932 --> 00:18:12,575
They're just using their balconies, I believe, this year.

372
00:18:12,615 --> 00:18:15,037
They're not going to do any parking spaces or outdoor dining.

373
00:18:15,397 --> 00:18:16,698
So it'll be like private premises.

374
00:18:18,031 --> 00:18:24,657
Oh, I think, Miranda, I think they did the same thing last year, but they still had to come in front of us.

375
00:18:25,178 --> 00:18:26,679
Sorry, I was just letting you guys know.

376
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:34,566
Yeah, because he did reach out to me and I told him that he still has to fill out the application and he did, so I don't know why he didn't.

377
00:18:35,006 --> 00:18:38,650
And the reason for him filling out the application is because what he's licensed for,

378
00:18:39,933 --> 00:18:41,373
It's just inside, yeah.

379
00:18:41,433 --> 00:18:41,993
Right, just inside.

380
00:18:42,013 --> 00:18:43,694
And I explained that to him, like, yeah.

381
00:18:44,234 --> 00:18:44,334
Okay.

382
00:18:44,354 --> 00:18:50,835
It was the same issue that we had last year, trying to explain that it was still, even though it's on the property, it still has to be.

383
00:18:50,855 --> 00:18:51,935
Correct.

384
00:18:52,075 --> 00:18:53,495
The license was just for inside.

385
00:18:53,695 --> 00:18:54,135
That's fine.

386
00:18:54,816 --> 00:18:56,656
And who was the other one, Daria?

387
00:18:56,736 --> 00:18:57,756
Hold on, Fiora.

388
00:18:57,776 --> 00:18:58,216
Take your time.

389
00:19:00,016 --> 00:19:08,718
So, Sabar we had, Fiorita we had, Carol, Salvatores, Asian Taste was not on here, right?

390
00:19:08,918 --> 00:19:09,098
Yeah.

391
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:10,893
Uh, yeah.

392
00:19:10,913 --> 00:19:17,595
So those, so it's porch, porch, real gusto and Asian taste.

393
00:19:18,315 --> 00:19:18,595
Okay.

394
00:19:19,595 --> 00:19:20,976
So I would suggest diarrhea.

395
00:19:21,016 --> 00:19:24,516
You, you contact them and tell them that, you know, they were on the agenda today.

396
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:30,218
No action was taken because nobody appeared and we will put them on next week's agenda.

397
00:19:30,698 --> 00:19:30,958
Okay.

398
00:19:32,378 --> 00:19:34,999
Um, and, uh, but they have to appear.

399
00:19:35,019 --> 00:19:35,079
Yep.

400
00:19:39,982 --> 00:19:40,362
Okay.

401
00:19:43,205 --> 00:19:43,545
All right.

402
00:19:43,926 --> 00:19:44,186
Okay.

403
00:19:45,947 --> 00:19:50,031
Miranda, any issues with any of the applications as they're coming through?

404
00:19:50,051 --> 00:19:51,493
Do you see any issues?

405
00:19:52,454 --> 00:19:53,334
Nothing so far.

406
00:19:53,395 --> 00:19:55,416
I think it's all looking good.

407
00:19:55,436 --> 00:19:57,679
We have a handful of new places, which is exciting.

408
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,161
Yeah.

409
00:20:01,142 --> 00:20:02,423
I know one is Neighborhood Kitchen.

410
00:20:02,723 --> 00:20:03,364
That was a new one.

411
00:20:03,947 --> 00:20:05,288
That's a new one.

412
00:20:05,608 --> 00:20:12,472
And Daria's in contact with the owner because they need like a full new license, I believe for beer and wine.

413
00:20:12,492 --> 00:20:15,634
But yeah, Tenoch is new.

414
00:20:16,635 --> 00:20:22,859
We have a few places that aren't going to do alcohol that are just like little shops.

415
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:24,420
So yeah, it's looking good.

416
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:25,480
So far so good.

417
00:20:26,421 --> 00:20:26,941
Good, good.

418
00:20:27,822 --> 00:20:28,062
Okay.

419
00:20:29,443 --> 00:20:29,723
All right.

420
00:20:30,263 --> 00:20:33,185
So is it next week, Daria, or is the next meeting?

421
00:20:34,713 --> 00:20:36,495
I'm just looking it up as I'm asking you the question.

422
00:20:37,235 --> 00:20:37,636
Hold on.

423
00:20:37,716 --> 00:20:40,178
I'm trying to pull up on my zone too.

424
00:20:40,478 --> 00:20:41,039
Hold on.

425
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,681
No, I don't have it on the 22nd.

426
00:20:44,782 --> 00:20:46,945
Um, hold on, hold on.

427
00:20:47,485 --> 00:20:47,845
Yeah.

428
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:53,471
Hold on.

429
00:20:53,491 --> 00:20:57,454
So the next meeting is going to be on Thursday, April 22nd.

430
00:20:57,534 --> 00:20:57,675
Okay.

431
00:20:59,972 --> 00:21:03,533
But, so that's what I was gonna ask you guys.

432
00:21:03,613 --> 00:21:05,074
Hold on, one, two, three.

433
00:21:05,794 --> 00:21:07,935
Our regular day is usually the 21st.

434
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:11,776
So should we, should I still keep the 22nd?

435
00:21:12,296 --> 00:21:14,056
I would like to consolidate them all into one.

436
00:21:14,977 --> 00:21:15,757
Yes, yes, yes.

437
00:21:15,777 --> 00:21:17,177
So just do one on Thursday.

438
00:21:17,197 --> 00:21:17,498
Okay.

439
00:21:17,518 --> 00:21:18,718
That's right, on Wednesday.

440
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:19,818
On Wednesday.

441
00:21:20,338 --> 00:21:20,859
Wednesday, the 21st.

442
00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:21,059
Okay.

443
00:21:21,099 --> 00:21:24,620
Because that'd be a normally, regularly scheduled meeting.

444
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:25,100
Yeah.

445
00:21:25,693 --> 00:21:31,077
Right, so let's bring in the outdoor dining on the 21st after the regular scheduled meeting.

446
00:21:31,977 --> 00:21:32,978
Immediately following that.

447
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:34,539
So tell them 1 o'clock.

448
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:35,820
1 o'clock?

449
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,981
1 o'clock, yep.

450
00:21:37,261 --> 00:21:38,342
1 o'clock on the 21st.

451
00:21:41,164 --> 00:21:42,565
So it's all in the same meeting?

452
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:43,605
Yep.

453
00:21:44,446 --> 00:21:45,627
Then we'll skip the 22nd.

454
00:21:46,527 --> 00:21:47,388
Okay.

455
00:21:47,508 --> 00:21:47,628
22nd.

456
00:21:49,169 --> 00:21:49,569
Oh yeah.

457
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:50,250
Meeting on the 22nd.

458
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:54,693
Yeah, because we had that one on too.

459
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:55,881
Yep.

460
00:21:55,901 --> 00:22:00,882
All right.

461
00:22:01,162 --> 00:22:02,563
I just changed my zoom.

462
00:22:02,603 --> 00:22:04,043
So I'll send that around one.

463
00:22:04,503 --> 00:22:05,503
I sent out an email.

464
00:22:05,523 --> 00:22:09,464
So the 25 makes sense.

465
00:22:10,224 --> 00:22:10,384
Yep.

466
00:22:10,624 --> 00:22:23,047
And we'll have somebody else, um, doing an actual applications, like one of our, one of our, um, clubs I think is changing a manager.

467
00:22:23,107 --> 00:22:23,267
Yep.

468
00:22:23,648 --> 00:22:24,928
So that's perfect.

469
00:22:25,508 --> 00:22:25,628
Yep.

470
00:22:26,811 --> 00:22:27,271
No problem.

471
00:22:29,413 --> 00:22:29,954
No problem.

472
00:22:31,655 --> 00:22:34,638
Any other business to come before the commission?

473
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:36,600
No, I think that's it.

474
00:22:37,581 --> 00:22:37,881
Okay.

475
00:22:39,162 --> 00:22:39,443
All right.

476
00:22:39,503 --> 00:22:41,244
Motion to adjourn would be in order.

477
00:22:43,366 --> 00:22:44,507
I'll make a motion to adjourn.

478
00:22:45,688 --> 00:22:45,908
Great.

479
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:48,331
Thank you very much.

480
00:22:48,371 --> 00:22:49,432
Thanks for all your help, Ben.

481
00:22:49,932 --> 00:22:50,453
Yeah.

482
00:22:50,473 --> 00:22:50,793
Thank you.

483
00:22:51,793 --> 00:22:52,113
No problem.

484
00:22:52,133 --> 00:22:52,513
Thanks guys.

485
00:22:52,974 --> 00:22:55,535
Sorry, I was a little late guys.

486
00:22:55,915 --> 00:22:56,475
That's all right.

487
00:22:56,535 --> 00:22:57,015
No problem.

488
00:22:57,296 --> 00:22:58,176
We'll just stock your pay.

489
00:22:58,716 --> 00:22:58,936
I know.
