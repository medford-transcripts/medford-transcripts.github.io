1
00:00:00,491 --> 00:00:02,153
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Daria, if you could read the preamble.

2
00:00:02,173 --> 00:00:04,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody's playing something in the background.

3
00:00:04,714 --> 00:00:04,914
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

4
00:00:04,975 --> 00:00:05,275
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

5
00:00:19,538 --> 00:00:23,160
[SPEAKER_03]: Just give me a second to read it.

6
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:39,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so pursuant to Governor Baker's March 12th, 2020, order suspending certain provisions of the open meeting law, general law chapter 38, chapter 18, and the governor's March 15th, 2020, order imposing strict limitations

13
00:01:55,392 --> 00:01:56,132
[SPEAKER_03]: That was small writing.

14
00:01:56,572 --> 00:01:56,933
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

15
00:01:57,073 --> 00:01:57,733
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Daria.

16
00:01:59,173 --> 00:02:06,496
[SPEAKER_01]: So the meeting will come to order and the first item on the agenda, Daria.

17
00:02:08,437 --> 00:02:08,657
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

18
00:02:08,677 --> 00:02:16,939
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first, second, it will be to approve minutes for March 17th, 2020 license commission meeting.

19
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,161
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

20
00:02:22,141 --> 00:02:23,702
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd make a motion to approve the minutes.

21
00:02:24,885 --> 00:02:29,029
[SPEAKER_04]: As presented, I'll second that motion to approve those minutes.

22
00:02:34,113 --> 00:02:34,773
[SPEAKER_01]: All those in favor.

23
00:02:34,793 --> 00:02:37,896
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.

24
00:02:38,797 --> 00:02:39,097
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

25
00:02:40,898 --> 00:02:41,179
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

26
00:02:41,839 --> 00:02:46,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Next will be a representative from the porch.

27
00:02:47,772 --> 00:02:54,996
[SPEAKER_03]: will present an application for alteration of premises at their establishment located at 175 Rivers Edge Drive, Medford Mass.

28
00:02:56,877 --> 00:02:57,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Is Jonathan on here?

29
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:01,900
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody from the porch?

30
00:03:04,201 --> 00:03:05,382
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, we'll hold that one aside.

31
00:03:05,942 --> 00:03:06,202
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

32
00:03:07,163 --> 00:03:09,925
[SPEAKER_03]: The next one is Real Gusto.

33
00:03:13,206 --> 00:03:14,227
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody from Real Gusto?

34
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:18,306
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I guess we'll hold that one off to the side, Daria.

35
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:20,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

36
00:03:21,188 --> 00:03:22,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Bistro 5.

37
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:26,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody from Bistro 5?

38
00:03:26,711 --> 00:03:27,431
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he's here.

39
00:03:27,451 --> 00:03:29,032
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice to see you.

40
00:03:29,052 --> 00:03:31,033
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to see you guys.

41
00:03:33,355 --> 00:03:34,395
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have your plan.

42
00:03:34,435 --> 00:03:37,037
[SPEAKER_01]: Is your plan any different than what it was last year, Vito?

43
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,841
[SPEAKER_00]: Internet is a little spotty here.

44
00:03:50,255 --> 00:03:52,716
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, might be better now.

45
00:03:53,376 --> 00:03:54,317
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

46
00:03:54,337 --> 00:03:55,137
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you have a question?

47
00:03:55,637 --> 00:03:56,858
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's just one question for me.

48
00:03:56,918 --> 00:03:59,939
[SPEAKER_01]: Is your plan any different than the one you presented last year?

49
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:17,166
[SPEAKER_00]: Same as last year, but last year we did have an issue with the barriers where we put a trellis.

50
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:22,732
[SPEAKER_00]: have to take those down.

51
00:04:23,492 --> 00:04:30,417
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have to do something else this year to separate the dining hall from the barriers.

52
00:04:30,497 --> 00:04:37,622
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we basically want to do now is put along the sidewalk, put basically just flowers, really.

53
00:04:38,963 --> 00:04:42,926
[SPEAKER_00]: But the flowers would be just kind of like a continuous planter.

54
00:04:45,495 --> 00:04:47,855
[SPEAKER_00]: But besides that, I'd say same exact spot.

55
00:04:49,356 --> 00:04:50,256
[SPEAKER_01]: Same number of tables?

56
00:04:51,316 --> 00:04:52,576
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, same number of tables.

57
00:04:52,636 --> 00:04:52,996
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

58
00:04:53,937 --> 00:04:56,517
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's it.

59
00:04:56,557 --> 00:04:56,857
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

60
00:04:57,817 --> 00:05:05,799
[SPEAKER_01]: And I assume what you're working out with the trellis, you're working out with the building department or somebody else?

61
00:05:07,379 --> 00:05:12,280
[SPEAKER_01]: I was saying the issue that you're having with the trellises, you're working that out with somebody at City Hall?

62
00:05:13,584 --> 00:05:21,089
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I think the traffic commissioner was here, and I will be in Todd, actually, I think.

63
00:05:21,749 --> 00:05:32,656
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, yeah, I will be talking to him about it, what I'm gonna plan on doing, so I can get it approved through him first, and then can go on with whatever.

64
00:05:32,676 --> 00:05:33,737
[SPEAKER_00]: Fine.

65
00:05:33,957 --> 00:05:42,202
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because the main thing, we just need a little bit of privacy, really, you know, as long as, without obstructing any view, that's really it.

66
00:05:43,663 --> 00:05:45,724
[SPEAKER_01]: Understood, understood.

67
00:05:45,764 --> 00:05:46,765
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have any other questions.

68
00:05:48,285 --> 00:05:49,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no, I don't either.

69
00:05:49,346 --> 00:05:58,030
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking over the application and I remember this from last year and I don't know that the trellis is really in our domain anyway to comment on.

70
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:00,711
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I don't have any issues with the gym.

71
00:06:01,412 --> 00:06:04,253
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so motion to approve the license for Bistro 5.

72
00:06:04,393 --> 00:06:06,274
[SPEAKER_01]: All those in favor?

73
00:06:07,955 --> 00:06:08,515
[SPEAKER_01]: Aye.

74
00:06:08,795 --> 00:06:08,915
[SPEAKER_01]: Aye.

75
00:06:09,675 --> 00:06:10,516
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

76
00:06:11,156 --> 00:06:11,837
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, good luck.

77
00:06:12,397 --> 00:06:12,717
[SPEAKER_01]: Good luck.

78
00:06:13,647 --> 00:06:14,248
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.

79
00:06:14,528 --> 00:06:15,248
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

80
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:17,070
[SPEAKER_01]: You're welcome.

81
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,491
[SPEAKER_01]: Next on the agenda, Daria.

82
00:06:26,398 --> 00:06:26,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry guys.

83
00:06:27,018 --> 00:06:28,259
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't realize I was on mute.

84
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,843
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, next one is Bertucci's, but they have not sent me an application.

85
00:06:32,863 --> 00:06:33,784
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

86
00:06:33,964 --> 00:06:36,286
[SPEAKER_03]: And I send them a reminder last night as well.

87
00:06:36,366 --> 00:06:38,167
[SPEAKER_03]: So I haven't received anything from them.

88
00:06:38,628 --> 00:06:39,048
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fine.

89
00:06:40,096 --> 00:06:42,778
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they might have outdoor dining, but I just got to check.

90
00:06:42,818 --> 00:06:44,639
[SPEAKER_03]: I just haven't had the chance to come around it.

91
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:49,262
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Petucci's does have outdoor dining by means of their own regular permit.

92
00:06:49,822 --> 00:06:50,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

93
00:06:50,162 --> 00:06:51,163
[SPEAKER_03]: So with alcohol.

94
00:06:51,723 --> 00:06:51,864
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

95
00:06:51,904 --> 00:06:52,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

96
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:53,625
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're kind of like Regina's Pizza.

97
00:06:53,665 --> 00:06:54,385
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're all set.

98
00:06:54,445 --> 00:06:54,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

99
00:06:55,026 --> 00:06:55,406
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

100
00:06:55,806 --> 00:06:56,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

101
00:06:56,266 --> 00:06:56,967
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll keep them out.

102
00:06:57,067 --> 00:06:58,868
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of figured that, but wasn't 100% sure.

103
00:06:58,908 --> 00:07:00,209
[SPEAKER_03]: That's okay.

104
00:07:00,869 --> 00:07:02,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Next one is C-Bar.

105
00:07:02,811 --> 00:07:03,231
[SPEAKER_03]: C-Bar?

106
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:03,911
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

107
00:07:03,931 --> 00:07:04,311
[SPEAKER_01]: C-Bar.

108
00:07:04,912 --> 00:07:05,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

109
00:07:06,053 --> 00:07:06,233
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

110
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:08,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody from C-Bar?

111
00:07:10,923 --> 00:07:12,244
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody present from SEBA?

112
00:07:15,545 --> 00:07:17,967
[SPEAKER_01]: Hearing and seeing none, I guess we'll put that on hold.

113
00:07:18,767 --> 00:07:20,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, okay.

114
00:07:21,769 --> 00:07:23,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Next one is FIORI Italy.

115
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:24,690
[SPEAKER_01]: FIORI Italy?

116
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:27,852
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody present from FIORI Italy?

117
00:07:29,953 --> 00:07:30,713
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, he's here.

118
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:31,714
[SPEAKER_03]: He's just on mute.

119
00:07:32,434 --> 00:07:33,434
[SPEAKER_03]: Andrea, you're on mute.

120
00:07:35,215 --> 00:07:36,136
[SPEAKER_03]: You're gonna unmute yourself.

121
00:07:38,337 --> 00:07:38,677
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

122
00:07:39,177 --> 00:07:40,058
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, thank you.

123
00:07:42,737 --> 00:07:49,321
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a question as I asked the prior petitioner, is there any change from your outdoor dining plan than what it was last year?

124
00:07:50,542 --> 00:07:52,843
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's the same, the same.

125
00:07:52,943 --> 00:07:53,144
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.

126
00:07:54,284 --> 00:07:58,227
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, have the barricades been installed already for you?

127
00:07:59,247 --> 00:07:59,427
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

128
00:08:00,028 --> 00:08:01,068
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, all right.

129
00:08:02,609 --> 00:08:04,070
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so same plan as last year?

130
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:08,453
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we have a lot of people calling that if they can sit outside.

131
00:08:09,013 --> 00:08:11,775
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, hopefully the weather stays in our favor to do that.

132
00:08:12,281 --> 00:08:13,782
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we deserve it.

133
00:08:14,323 --> 00:08:14,803
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you do.

134
00:08:15,143 --> 00:08:15,884
[SPEAKER_01]: No question about it.

135
00:08:15,964 --> 00:08:17,645
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I mean, everyone, everyone deserves it.

136
00:08:17,785 --> 00:08:18,286
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I know.

137
00:08:18,606 --> 00:08:19,166
[SPEAKER_01]: I know what you mean.

138
00:08:19,527 --> 00:08:20,007
[SPEAKER_01]: We all do.

139
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:21,488
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody needs a break.

140
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:21,928
[SPEAKER_01]: I get it.

141
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:23,290
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially from this COVID.

142
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:24,350
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.

143
00:08:26,352 --> 00:08:27,393
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have any other questions.

144
00:08:27,873 --> 00:08:34,298
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we just met about the premises and we're familiar with that and how that worked out last year.

145
00:08:34,358 --> 00:08:36,700
[SPEAKER_04]: And so same as Jim.

146
00:08:38,373 --> 00:08:42,817
[SPEAKER_04]: I would make, Jim, I'd make a motion to accept the alteration of premises here.

147
00:08:43,998 --> 00:08:44,158
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

148
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:45,659
[SPEAKER_01]: So all those in favor.

149
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,981
[SPEAKER_01]: I oppose none.

150
00:08:48,722 --> 00:08:49,863
[SPEAKER_01]: Your license has been granted.

151
00:08:51,244 --> 00:08:51,585
[SPEAKER_01]: Very good.

152
00:08:51,645 --> 00:08:52,606
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

153
00:08:52,986 --> 00:08:53,386
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

154
00:08:53,406 --> 00:08:54,527
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.

[SPEAKER_01]: Good afternoon.

158
00:09:01,513 --> 00:09:03,235
[SPEAKER_03]: Mary, Mary, you got to unmute yourself.

159
00:09:10,429 --> 00:09:11,169
[SPEAKER_01]: Mari, you're on mute.

160
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:12,911
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.

161
00:09:12,991 --> 00:09:14,191
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you got it.

162
00:09:14,812 --> 00:09:15,532
[SPEAKER_01]: How are we doing today?

163
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:16,433
[SPEAKER_01]: Good, thanks.

164
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:16,993
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing?

165
00:09:17,393 --> 00:09:18,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Doing well, thanks, Jimmy.

166
00:09:18,874 --> 00:09:19,355
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good.

167
00:09:20,395 --> 00:09:22,957
[SPEAKER_01]: Mari, just the same question I had for the prior petitioners.

168
00:09:24,118 --> 00:09:26,079
[SPEAKER_01]: Any change in your outdoor dining plan?

169
00:09:26,619 --> 00:09:28,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything's going to be the exact same.

170
00:09:28,981 --> 00:09:29,661
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

171
00:09:30,962 --> 00:09:32,003
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no further questions.

172
00:09:33,303 --> 00:09:34,604
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I remember it last year.

173
00:09:34,944 --> 00:09:36,165
[SPEAKER_04]: No, there's no issues with that.

174
00:09:36,485 --> 00:09:37,686
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys had it along the bridge.

175
00:09:38,066 --> 00:09:38,987
[SPEAKER_01]: When will you start it, Mari?

176
00:09:39,949 --> 00:09:41,769
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I think we can start on the 15th.

177
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:42,790
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wasn't permitting.

178
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:44,210
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, good.

179
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:45,950
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

180
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:50,571
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I'll make a motion to approve the license as presented all in favor.

181
00:09:51,111 --> 00:09:51,271
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

182
00:09:52,431 --> 00:09:52,711
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

183
00:09:53,511 --> 00:09:53,671
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.

184
00:09:53,691 --> 00:09:53,951
[SPEAKER_01]: Mari.

185
00:09:53,971 --> 00:09:54,532
[SPEAKER_01]: Good luck to you.

186
00:09:55,572 --> 00:09:57,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

187
00:09:57,612 --> 00:09:58,472
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice to see you as well.

188
00:09:58,612 --> 00:09:58,972
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

189
00:10:00,273 --> 00:10:05,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Next one is Salvatore's anybody from Salvatore is present.

190
00:10:06,034 --> 00:10:07,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Denise.

191
00:10:10,194 --> 00:10:11,515
[SPEAKER_01]: Denise, same question as before.

192
00:10:12,035 --> 00:10:14,215
[SPEAKER_01]: Any change from the outdoor dining from last year?

193
00:10:14,235 --> 00:10:15,676
[SPEAKER_01]: Same number of tables?

194
00:10:15,976 --> 00:10:16,616
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's the same.

195
00:10:16,976 --> 00:10:17,697
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes it easy.

196
00:10:17,877 --> 00:10:18,557
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

197
00:10:19,217 --> 00:10:19,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

198
00:10:20,417 --> 00:10:21,238
[SPEAKER_01]: Ben, any questions?

199
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:24,079
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I was just looking for the Salvatore's application.

200
00:10:24,119 --> 00:10:24,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it in there?

201
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:29,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it should be, yep.

202
00:10:30,801 --> 00:10:32,521
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

203
00:10:33,922 --> 00:10:34,502
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I don't.

204
00:10:34,642 --> 00:10:35,942
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's in the back still?

205
00:10:35,962 --> 00:10:36,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

206
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:40,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, just waiting for the barriers from the city.

207
00:10:40,986 --> 00:10:41,226
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

208
00:10:43,247 --> 00:10:45,269
[SPEAKER_04]: No, seems like a good place for it again.

209
00:10:45,329 --> 00:10:47,611
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, I don't have any further questions on it.

210
00:10:48,211 --> 00:10:54,375
[SPEAKER_01]: Great motion to approve the, uh, license for Salvatore's would be an order all those in favor.

211
00:10:56,097 --> 00:10:56,317
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

212
00:10:56,737 --> 00:10:57,097
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

213
00:10:57,498 --> 00:10:58,258
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Denise.

214
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:00,040
[SPEAKER_01]: Good luck.

215
00:11:02,341 --> 00:11:02,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

216
00:11:02,641 --> 00:11:05,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Next one is Asian taste, Asian taste.

217
00:11:08,138 --> 00:11:12,500
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody from Asian Taste wants to speak on behalf of the license?

218
00:11:15,181 --> 00:11:16,222
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody from Asian Taste?

219
00:11:16,402 --> 00:11:17,802
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, we'll put that one aside, Daria.

220
00:11:18,202 --> 00:11:19,663
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and then Tanak?

221
00:11:21,104 --> 00:11:22,084
[SPEAKER_03]: I know Alvaro's on.

222
00:11:22,424 --> 00:11:22,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Yup, Tanak.

223
00:11:22,844 --> 00:11:22,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Yup.

224
00:11:23,325 --> 00:11:23,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Alvaro?

225
00:11:24,365 --> 00:11:24,765
[SPEAKER_01]: Alvaro?

226
00:11:24,845 --> 00:11:25,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't hear you, hold on.

227
00:11:25,946 --> 00:11:26,466
[SPEAKER_01]: You're on mute.

228
00:11:26,726 --> 00:11:27,446
[SPEAKER_01]: Yup, thank you.

229
00:11:29,007 --> 00:11:30,928
[SPEAKER_01]: Alvaro, same question as the prior petition.

230
00:11:30,968 --> 00:11:35,210
[SPEAKER_01]: Is any change in your outdoor seating capacity than it was last year?

231
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:38,157
[SPEAKER_05]: We did not apply last year.

232
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:39,898
[SPEAKER_05]: We did not have any other city.

233
00:11:40,998 --> 00:11:41,358
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

234
00:11:41,678 --> 00:11:43,298
[SPEAKER_01]: How many tables do you have under this scenario?

235
00:11:44,619 --> 00:11:49,300
[SPEAKER_05]: We have, we applying for three on each of the parking spots.

236
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:54,341
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're looking to have two parking spots and then two tables on each side of the windows.

237
00:11:55,821 --> 00:11:56,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Fine.

238
00:11:56,661 --> 00:11:57,642
[SPEAKER_05]: So, so eight?

239
00:11:59,042 --> 00:12:00,682
[SPEAKER_05]: So there will be three, six, eight.

240
00:12:00,802 --> 00:12:00,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

241
00:12:02,243 --> 00:12:04,043
[SPEAKER_05]: Has the city approved the two parking spaces?

242
00:12:06,093 --> 00:12:10,175
[SPEAKER_05]: I submit the application and this is what I have first.

243
00:12:10,235 --> 00:12:12,356
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this meeting, I'm still waiting on them.

244
00:12:13,036 --> 00:12:13,436
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fine.

245
00:12:13,456 --> 00:12:14,857
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we know anything about that Daria?

246
00:12:15,817 --> 00:12:17,718
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure Miranda.

247
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:20,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're reviewing tomorrow internally.

248
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:27,523
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, so far, I haven't heard any issues from transportation on the parking places.

249
00:12:28,551 --> 00:12:29,291
[SPEAKER_01]: So far, so good.

250
00:12:29,912 --> 00:12:35,754
[SPEAKER_01]: So Alvaro, the only thing is we'd like to have the city on board before we issue the permit for the outdoor dining.

251
00:12:36,195 --> 00:12:50,421
[SPEAKER_01]: We just don't want to give you a permit for the outdoor dining and then find out the city, I'm not suggesting they do, that they have a... So my suggestion for getting around it, in the future diary, we should make sure that the city's on board with every application before they come before us.

252
00:12:50,882 --> 00:12:55,124
[SPEAKER_01]: And I understand we're trying to move this on a fast pace for everybody, and I get that.

253
00:12:55,944 --> 00:13:04,110
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so my suggestion is we approve it subject to the city and the traffic department approving or ever else Miranda has to do that.

254
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:07,592
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, being on board with that, if that's okay with you, Alvaro.

255
00:13:08,172 --> 00:13:09,353
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's totally fine.

256
00:13:09,633 --> 00:13:09,793
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

257
00:13:09,913 --> 00:13:10,194
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

258
00:13:11,034 --> 00:13:22,602
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, so we'll do this, uh, approval subject to, uh, diarrhea, getting confirmation from the city, um, that they've approved the two parking spaces being dedicated for your outdoor dining.

259
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:24,143
[SPEAKER_01]: That okay, Ben.

260
00:13:25,177 --> 00:13:25,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that makes sense.

261
00:13:26,558 --> 00:13:29,459
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I think we had to do last year a couple times.

262
00:13:29,859 --> 00:13:33,221
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is kind of the same for you since this is your first year.

263
00:13:33,261 --> 00:13:35,482
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's, but I'm in favor of it.

264
00:13:36,363 --> 00:13:42,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, yeah, as long as you can get all the barriers up and in place and it's just safe for all your, um, customers, that seems, seems great.

265
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:43,086
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

266
00:13:44,106 --> 00:13:51,430
[SPEAKER_01]: So a motion to approve the, um, the outdoor dining license for, uh, uh, Tanosh would be an order all those in favor.

267
00:13:53,031 --> 00:13:53,111
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.

268
00:13:53,728 --> 00:13:56,490
[SPEAKER_01]: I, again, Daria is subject to the city's approval, okay?

269
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:59,171
[SPEAKER_04]: I just have one very important question though.

270
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:01,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it Tanach or is it Tanach?

271
00:14:02,033 --> 00:14:02,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Tanach.

272
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:03,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Tanach.

273
00:14:03,413 --> 00:14:05,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Tanach, yeah.

274
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:05,595
[SPEAKER_04]: Good to know.

275
00:14:06,195 --> 00:14:06,955
[SPEAKER_04]: Debate at my house.

276
00:14:09,437 --> 00:14:10,757
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it too.

277
00:14:12,058 --> 00:14:13,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, that sounds good.

278
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:15,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you guys and be safe.

279
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:16,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

280
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:16,701
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, you too.

281
00:14:16,961 --> 00:14:17,721
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Alvaro.

282
00:14:17,761 --> 00:14:17,901
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.

283
00:14:18,502 --> 00:14:18,882
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

284
00:14:20,363 --> 00:14:21,123
[SPEAKER_01]: Next on the agenda.

285
00:14:21,405 --> 00:14:22,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's it.

286
00:14:23,046 --> 00:14:25,248
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a couple more people on.

287
00:14:25,968 --> 00:14:30,852
[SPEAKER_03]: We have three people on, but I have no idea where they're from.

288
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:32,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you guys let us know whoever is on?

289
00:14:32,933 --> 00:14:34,334
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm from Sabar, Mexico.

290
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:35,655
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Sabar, okay.

291
00:14:35,815 --> 00:14:37,036
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Sabar, okay, hold on.

292
00:14:37,336 --> 00:14:39,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so go back to the Sabar one.

293
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,121
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have that application, Daria?

294
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:45,000
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

295
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:45,860
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

296
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:51,742
[SPEAKER_01]: So, say bar is your outdoor dining plan, any different than it was last year.

297
00:14:52,462 --> 00:14:52,622
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

298
00:14:53,482 --> 00:14:54,342
[SPEAKER_01]: Same number of tables.

299
00:14:55,002 --> 00:14:56,683
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they remember tables.

300
00:14:57,483 --> 00:15:01,584
[SPEAKER_01]: And I assume in every one of these instances diary I'm making an assumption.

301
00:15:02,264 --> 00:15:06,745
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe I shouldn't make the assumption that the city is signed off on all of these that we're looking at.

302
00:15:07,977 --> 00:15:13,020
[SPEAKER_03]: They're gonna, so like Miranda said, we're gonna talk about it, all of us tomorrow.

303
00:15:13,261 --> 00:15:20,966
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I think we're gonna probably hear back on the approval next week, but I'm not gonna issue anything till we get a final approval from the mayor.

304
00:15:21,406 --> 00:15:25,169
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I thought we scheduled these meetings so that it was subsequent to the city's decision.

305
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,071
[SPEAKER_02]: This week was a weird one.

306
00:15:29,091 --> 00:15:33,574
[SPEAKER_02]: We wanted to meet before you guys did, but half of our team was busy.

307
00:15:34,155 --> 00:15:34,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

308
00:15:35,235 --> 00:15:37,397
[SPEAKER_02]: But we've been talking and I don't think they're,

309
00:15:38,543 --> 00:15:40,023
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have flagged anything for you all.

310
00:15:40,163 --> 00:15:40,504
[SPEAKER_01]: I got it.

311
00:15:40,644 --> 00:15:41,044
[SPEAKER_01]: I got it.

312
00:15:41,384 --> 00:15:54,508
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the only thing diary is I don't want to hold these public hearings and inconvenience the customers and think they have a license when in fact, you know, it's preemptive, it could be preempted by the city's action.

313
00:15:55,288 --> 00:16:02,030
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's in the future, unless there's something happening on the day, you know, let's hold until the city approves.

314
00:16:03,138 --> 00:16:08,420
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, all of the, um, barricades and whatever's necessary, and then we take our action.

315
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:09,280
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

316
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:22,485
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to be consistent, what we will do with say bar is what we've done with the prior, uh, applicants as well as we will hold all of the applications today, pending approval, uh, of the city by the city.

317
00:16:24,045 --> 00:16:24,325
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

318
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:30,647
[SPEAKER_01]: And the city should notify you if there's an issue, uh, before next week diary.

319
00:16:30,707 --> 00:16:30,988
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

320
00:16:31,328 --> 00:16:31,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

321
00:16:32,088 --> 00:16:32,288
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:38,108
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

325
00:16:41,149 --> 00:16:41,449
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

326
00:16:41,869 --> 00:16:42,830
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no further questions.

327
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:44,450
[SPEAKER_01]: A motion to approve would be an order.

328
00:16:45,151 --> 00:16:45,871
[SPEAKER_01]: All those in favor.

329
00:16:47,452 --> 00:16:47,552
[SPEAKER_01]: Aye.

330
00:16:47,872 --> 00:16:47,992
[SPEAKER_01]: Aye.

00:16:48,832 --> 00:16:49,232
[SPEAKER_01]: Opposed.

[SPEAKER_01]: None.

333
00:16:50,453 --> 00:16:54,635
[SPEAKER_01]: Your license has been approved subject to the city approving your outdoor dining plan.

334
00:16:55,255 --> 00:16:55,595
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

335

[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, sir.

00:16:57,936 --> 00:16:58,476
[SPEAKER_01]: Good luck.

[SPEAKER_01]: Good luck.

340
00:17:01,463 --> 00:17:04,164
[SPEAKER_01]: Next on the agenda, going back to the agenda, Daria.

343
00:17:11,386 --> 00:17:16,467
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, yes, Stephen Napolitano.

00:17:16,507 --> 00:17:17,467
[SPEAKER_01]: Daria, email.

345
00:17:17,547 --> 00:17:18,147
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't hear you.

346
00:17:19,368 --> 00:17:20,108
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you hear me?

347
00:17:20,368 --> 00:17:21,108
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, now I can.

00:17:21,308 --> 00:17:22,048
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, now we can.

[SPEAKER_01]: With Pizzeria Regina.

350
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:25,759
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

351
00:17:26,259 --> 00:17:32,202
[SPEAKER_05]: At 44 station landing, I had emailed Daria just want to make sure that everything is all set.

352
00:17:32,303 --> 00:17:33,423
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yes, you're all set.

353
00:17:34,103 --> 00:17:36,845
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have outdoor dining already as part of your license.

354
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:37,925
[SPEAKER_01]: That is correct.

355
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:38,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

356
00:17:38,486 --> 00:17:38,686
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

357
00:17:38,906 --> 00:17:39,766
[SPEAKER_01]: So you are all set.

358
00:17:40,006 --> 00:17:41,487
[SPEAKER_01]: I thank you for coming to this meeting.

359
00:17:41,947 --> 00:17:43,188
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's no need.

360
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:44,869
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for participating.

361
00:17:45,129 --> 00:17:45,949
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you're all set.

362
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:46,890
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

363
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:47,850
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

364
00:17:48,731 --> 00:17:49,151
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

365
00:17:50,512 --> 00:17:52,553
[SPEAKER_01]: So then we're just to go back.

366
00:17:52,893 --> 00:17:54,694
[SPEAKER_01]: Who wasn't here that was on your agenda?

367
00:17:54,734 --> 00:17:55,094
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you just

368
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:57,226
[SPEAKER_01]: We just talked about those names?

369
00:17:57,986 --> 00:18:04,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was the Porch, Real Gusto, Bistro 5 we had.

370
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:07,872
[SPEAKER_02]: Real Gusto, they're not doing an outdoor dining setup.

371
00:18:07,932 --> 00:18:12,575
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just using their balconies, I believe, this year.

372
00:18:12,615 --> 00:18:15,037
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going to do any parking spaces or outdoor dining.

373
00:18:15,397 --> 00:18:16,698
[SPEAKER_02]: So it'll be like private premises.

374
00:18:18,031 --> 00:18:24,657
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I think, Miranda, I think they did the same thing last year, but they still had to come in front of us.

375
00:18:25,178 --> 00:18:26,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I was just letting you guys know.

376
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:34,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because he did reach out to me and I told him that he still has to fill out the application and he did, so I don't know why he didn't.

377
00:18:35,006 --> 00:18:38,650
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason for him filling out the application is because what he's licensed for,

378
00:18:39,933 --> 00:18:41,373
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just inside, yeah.

379
00:18:41,433 --> 00:18:41,993
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, just inside.

380
00:18:42,013 --> 00:18:43,694
[SPEAKER_03]: And I explained that to him, like, yeah.

381
00:18:44,234 --> 00:18:44,334
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

382
00:18:44,354 --> 00:18:50,835
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the same issue that we had last year, trying to explain that it was still, even though it's on the property, it still has to be.

383
00:18:50,855 --> 00:18:51,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.

384
00:18:52,075 --> 00:18:53,495
[SPEAKER_03]: The license was just for inside.

385
00:18:53,695 --> 00:18:54,135
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fine.

386
00:18:54,816 --> 00:18:56,656
[SPEAKER_03]: And who was the other one, Daria?

387
00:18:56,736 --> 00:18:57,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on, Fiora.

388
00:18:57,776 --> 00:18:58,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Take your time.

389
00:19:00,016 --> 00:19:08,718
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Sabar we had, Fiorita we had, Carol, Salvatores, Asian Taste was not on here, right?

390
00:19:08,918 --> 00:19:09,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

391
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:10,893
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, yeah.

392
00:19:10,913 --> 00:19:17,595
[SPEAKER_03]: So those, so it's porch, porch, real gusto and Asian taste.

393
00:19:18,315 --> 00:19:18,595
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

394
00:19:19,595 --> 00:19:20,976
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would suggest diarrhea.

395
00:19:21,016 --> 00:19:24,516
[SPEAKER_01]: You, you contact them and tell them that, you know, they were on the agenda today.

396
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:30,218
[SPEAKER_01]: No action was taken because nobody appeared and we will put them on next week's agenda.

397
00:19:30,698 --> 00:19:30,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

398
00:19:32,378 --> 00:19:34,999
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, uh, but they have to appear.

399
00:19:35,019 --> 00:19:35,079
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

400
00:19:39,982 --> 00:19:40,362
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

401
00:19:43,205 --> 00:19:43,545
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

402
00:19:43,926 --> 00:19:44,186
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

403
00:19:45,947 --> 00:19:50,031
[SPEAKER_01]: Miranda, any issues with any of the applications as they're coming through?

404
00:19:50,051 --> 00:19:51,493
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see any issues?

405
00:19:52,454 --> 00:19:53,334
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing so far.

406
00:19:53,395 --> 00:19:55,416
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's all looking good.

407
00:19:55,436 --> 00:19:57,679
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a handful of new places, which is exciting.

408
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,161
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

409
00:20:01,142 --> 00:20:02,423
[SPEAKER_01]: I know one is Neighborhood Kitchen.

410
00:20:02,723 --> 00:20:03,364
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a new one.

411
00:20:03,947 --> 00:20:05,288
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a new one.

412
00:20:05,608 --> 00:20:12,472
[SPEAKER_02]: And Daria's in contact with the owner because they need like a full new license, I believe for beer and wine.

413
00:20:12,492 --> 00:20:15,634
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, Tenoch is new.

414
00:20:16,635 --> 00:20:22,859
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a few places that aren't going to do alcohol that are just like little shops.

415
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:24,420
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it's looking good.

416
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:25,480
[SPEAKER_01]: So far so good.

417
00:20:26,421 --> 00:20:26,941
[SPEAKER_01]: Good, good.

418
00:20:27,822 --> 00:20:28,062
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

419
00:20:29,443 --> 00:20:29,723
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

420
00:20:30,263 --> 00:20:33,185
[SPEAKER_01]: So is it next week, Daria, or is the next meeting?

421
00:20:34,713 --> 00:20:36,495
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just looking it up as I'm asking you the question.

422
00:20:37,235 --> 00:20:37,636
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on.

423
00:20:37,716 --> 00:20:40,178
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to pull up on my zone too.

424
00:20:40,478 --> 00:20:41,039
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on.

425
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,681
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't have it on the 22nd.

426
00:20:44,782 --> 00:20:46,945
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, hold on, hold on.

427
00:20:47,485 --> 00:20:47,845
Yeah.

428
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:53,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on.

429
00:20:53,491 --> 00:20:57,454
[SPEAKER_03]: So the next meeting is going to be on Thursday, April 22nd.

430
00:20:57,534 --> 00:20:57,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

431
00:20:59,972 --> 00:21:03,533
[SPEAKER_03]: But, so that's what I was gonna ask you guys.

432
00:21:03,613 --> 00:21:05,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on, one, two, three.

433
00:21:05,794 --> 00:21:07,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Our regular day is usually the 21st.

434
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:11,776
[SPEAKER_03]: So should we, should I still keep the 22nd?

435
00:21:12,296 --> 00:21:14,056
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to consolidate them all into one.

436
00:21:14,977 --> 00:21:15,757
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yes, yes.

437
00:21:15,777 --> 00:21:17,177
[SPEAKER_01]: So just do one on Thursday.

438
00:21:17,197 --> 00:21:17,498
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

439
00:21:17,518 --> 00:21:18,718
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right, on Wednesday.

440
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:19,818
[SPEAKER_01]: On Wednesday.

441
00:21:20,338 --> 00:21:20,859
[SPEAKER_01]: Wednesday, the 21st.

442
00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:21,059
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

443
00:21:21,099 --> 00:21:24,620
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that'd be a normally, regularly scheduled meeting.

444
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:25,100
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

445
00:21:25,693 --> 00:21:31,077
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, so let's bring in the outdoor dining on the 21st after the regular scheduled meeting.

446
00:21:31,977 --> 00:21:32,978
[SPEAKER_01]: Immediately following that.

447
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:34,539
[SPEAKER_01]: So tell them 1 o'clock.

448
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:35,820
[SPEAKER_01]: 1 o'clock?

449
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,981
[SPEAKER_04]: 1 o'clock, yep.

450
00:21:37,261 --> 00:21:38,342
[SPEAKER_01]: 1 o'clock on the 21st.

451
00:21:41,164 --> 00:21:42,565
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's all in the same meeting?

452
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:43,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

453
00:21:44,446 --> 00:21:45,627
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we'll skip the 22nd.

454
00:21:46,527 --> 00:21:47,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

455
00:21:47,508 --> 00:21:47,628
[SPEAKER_04]: 22nd.

456
00:21:49,169 --> 00:21:49,569
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.

457
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:50,250
[SPEAKER_01]: Meeting on the 22nd.

458
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:54,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because we had that one on too.

459
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:55,881
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

460
00:21:55,901 --> 00:22:00,882
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

461
00:22:01,162 --> 00:22:02,563
[SPEAKER_03]: I just changed my zoom.

462
00:22:02,603 --> 00:22:04,043
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll send that around one.

463
00:22:04,503 --> 00:22:05,503
[SPEAKER_03]: I sent out an email.

464
00:22:05,523 --> 00:22:09,464
[SPEAKER_03]: So the 25 makes sense.

465
00:22:10,224 --> 00:22:10,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

466
00:22:10,624 --> 00:22:23,047
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll have somebody else, um, doing an actual applications, like one of our, one of our, um, clubs I think is changing a manager.

467
00:22:23,107 --> 00:22:23,267
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

468
00:22:23,648 --> 00:22:24,928
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's perfect.

469
00:22:25,508 --> 00:22:25,628
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

470
00:22:26,811 --> 00:22:27,271
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem.

471
00:22:29,413 --> 00:22:29,954
