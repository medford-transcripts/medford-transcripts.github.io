3
00:00:44,820 --> 00:01:12,898
[SPEAKER_00]: But before I introduce today's special guest, I want to take a moment to extend an invitation to any member of the Meffitt City Council and also any member of the Meffitt School Committee who is a candidate for re-election to appear on Meffitt Happenings to share their positions on current issues facing the city.

6
00:01:41,044 --> 00:01:43,065
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, and thanks for inviting me.

7
00:01:43,105 --> 00:01:44,326
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited to be here.

8
00:01:44,827 --> 00:01:45,627
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Milva.

9
00:01:45,687 --> 00:01:49,450
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna get right into this, so we'll get started.

10
00:01:50,271 --> 00:01:54,874
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can give the audience some background information about yourself,

11
00:01:55,835 --> 00:01:56,956
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's Milva McDonald?

12
00:01:57,757 --> 00:01:58,017
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.

13
00:01:58,677 --> 00:02:03,742
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm Milva McDonald, and I've lived in Medford for about 32 years.

14
00:02:04,482 --> 00:02:08,706
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been in my current home in West Medford for about 25 years.

15
00:02:10,407 --> 00:02:18,454
[SPEAKER_01]: I had several, three decades, I worked in journalism at the Boston Globe in the calendar section, if anybody remembers that.

16
00:02:18,654 --> 00:02:20,115
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I remember the calendar section.

17
00:02:20,555 --> 00:02:21,456
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a great section.

18
00:02:21,476 --> 00:02:21,556
[SPEAKER_01]: LS.

19
00:02:21,596 --> 00:02:22,017
[SPEAKER_01]: It was.

20
00:02:22,097 --> 00:02:23,538
[SPEAKER_01]: It was great.

21
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:30,065
[SPEAKER_01]: I also worked in the Globe West and Northwest and then eventually Boston.com.

22
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:34,470
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I work for a publicist, a very niche publicist.

23
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:36,932
[SPEAKER_01]: We promote exclusively jazz musicians.

24
00:02:38,013 --> 00:02:40,095
[SPEAKER_01]: I also do some teaching and tutoring.

25
00:02:41,477 --> 00:02:42,959
[SPEAKER_01]: I have some students.

26
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:44,902
[SPEAKER_01]: I homeschooled all four of my kids.

27
00:02:45,343 --> 00:02:55,317
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and during that time, I co-founded a secular nonprofit called Advocates for Home Education in Massachusetts, which is still thriving.

28
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:58,981
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm also a writer.

29
00:02:59,021 --> 00:03:01,423
[SPEAKER_01]: I've written a couple of books about homeschooling.

30
00:03:01,483 --> 00:03:04,826
[SPEAKER_01]: I've written short stories that I've had published in various journals.

31
00:03:06,027 --> 00:03:07,048
[SPEAKER_01]: I also love music.

32
00:03:07,529 --> 00:03:11,192
[SPEAKER_01]: I sing in three choruses, one called the Holla Lisa Singers.

33
00:03:11,693 --> 00:03:14,375
[SPEAKER_01]: And the director of that chorus lives right here in Medford also.

34
00:03:16,017 --> 00:03:18,018
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just sang in the Harvard Summer Chorus.

35
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:18,999
[SPEAKER_01]: That was great fun.

36
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,021
[SPEAKER_01]: And another chorus called Mutamonia.

37
00:03:22,442 --> 00:03:24,323
[SPEAKER_01]: I also am a potter.

38
00:03:24,363 --> 00:03:28,684
[SPEAKER_01]: I took up pottery a couple of years ago, and I absolutely love it.

39
00:03:29,744 --> 00:03:32,725
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see me at craft fairs around Medford this fall.

40
00:03:32,765 --> 00:03:33,926
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice, very nice.

41
00:03:34,086 --> 00:03:37,347
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also have a few things at the gift shop at Arts Collaborative Medford.

42
00:03:37,547 --> 00:03:38,787
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay, that's wonderful.

43
00:03:39,147 --> 00:03:40,448
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great background.

44
00:03:40,468 --> 00:03:41,968
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of experience.

45
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:43,589
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I said I have four kids.

46
00:03:43,609 --> 00:03:45,069
[SPEAKER_01]: I also have three grandkids.

47
00:03:45,129 --> 00:03:46,149
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, wow.

48
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:47,910
[SPEAKER_00]: So you are a busy person.

49
00:03:48,651 --> 00:03:52,820
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite accomplished too, I'll add that to your resume there.

50
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,102
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty impressive.

51
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:58,631
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice background.

52
00:03:59,571 --> 00:04:05,936
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you give us a few reasons why you're running for a seat on the Meffitt City Council?

53
00:04:06,096 --> 00:04:06,637
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

54
00:04:08,118 --> 00:04:12,741
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, giving back to the community has always been important to me and I've always been a hard worker.

55
00:04:12,761 --> 00:04:16,043
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of got my work ethic from my mom.

56
00:04:16,544 --> 00:04:19,706
[SPEAKER_01]: She was an Italian immigrant who came to the United States in the 1950s.

57
00:04:21,467 --> 00:04:21,907
[SPEAKER_01]: at the age of 27.

58
00:04:22,087 --> 00:04:25,629
[SPEAKER_01]: It was quite the culture shock for her.

59
00:04:26,909 --> 00:04:38,294
[SPEAKER_01]: She had really never been 10 miles out of her village until that point and now she's in this country experiencing running water, electricity, heat for the very first time.

60
00:04:40,595 --> 00:04:48,623
[SPEAKER_01]: So my Italian heritage and my experience as the daughter of a working class immigrant sort of contribute to who I am.

61
00:04:49,684 --> 00:04:55,650
[SPEAKER_01]: And my views on the importance of listening, tolerance, empathy, things like that.

62
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:59,274
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's sort of a background.

63
00:04:59,314 --> 00:05:01,316
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also really like to get things done.

64
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:14,259
[SPEAKER_01]: And a few years ago, I decided that I'd been hearing about charter review in the city for a very long time, and I thought, I really would like to see this get done.

65
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,164
[SPEAKER_01]: So in 2021, I kind of just rallied people and said,

66
00:05:20,965 --> 00:05:24,208
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, I'm going to invite everybody over, talk about charter review.

67
00:05:24,969 --> 00:05:37,801
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people that had been involved in the past, like Jim Silva and a couple of other people, we got together, we sort of brought, we created a group called the Medford Charter Review Coalition.

68
00:05:39,099 --> 00:05:42,182
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were pursuing different ways to get charter review done.

69
00:05:42,803 --> 00:05:46,367
[SPEAKER_01]: We said we're just going to try everything and we were collecting signatures.

70
00:05:47,288 --> 00:05:58,760
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also learned that one of the ways and which is actually the most common way for charter review to get done in Massachusetts is for a city committee to be appointed.

71
00:06:00,303 --> 00:06:08,894
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that committee would do the work of the review and then it would go through the city government and then to the state house and back to the voters.

72
00:06:09,315 --> 00:06:13,981
[SPEAKER_01]: So we approached the mayor and said, would you please form a committee?

73
00:06:14,422 --> 00:06:15,083
[SPEAKER_01]: And she did.

74
00:06:16,282 --> 00:06:18,524
[SPEAKER_01]: And to my honor, I was appointed chair.

75
00:06:19,304 --> 00:06:26,008
[SPEAKER_01]: Initially, I was co-chair with Laurel Siegel, but then she left to work in the city's planning department.

76
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:33,913
[SPEAKER_01]: And we spent, we started in about, I think it was like November or December of 2022.

77
00:06:34,434 --> 00:06:42,239
[SPEAKER_01]: We finished up in late 2024, and I chaired the 11-member committee, and we dove into all things charter.

78
00:06:42,339 --> 00:06:43,299
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about

79
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:47,462
[SPEAKER_01]: Charters from around the state, we prioritize public engagement.

80
00:06:49,163 --> 00:06:58,909
[SPEAKER_01]: So my experience chairing that committee, learning about local government and listening and talking to residents just really inspired me to stay involved with the city council run.

81
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:05,914
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to bring that same level of research and depth and listening to the city council.

82
00:07:06,418 --> 00:07:07,499
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very good.

83
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:15,665
[SPEAKER_00]: That immigrant story, by the way, that goes, that relates to a lot of people in Medford and our audience.

84
00:07:15,725 --> 00:07:17,547
[SPEAKER_00]: It really does, that's a great story.

85
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:28,896
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so we know you chaired the Medford Charter Study Committee, and we all thank you for your service to the city.

86
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:34,780
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to say, you and your committee, you did an excellent job.

87
00:07:35,641 --> 00:07:36,222
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you did.

88
00:07:36,242 --> 00:07:40,146
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I know the work that went in, you know, we watched the process.

89
00:07:40,506 --> 00:07:41,187
[SPEAKER_00]: It was something.

90
00:07:42,889 --> 00:07:49,195
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, can you share your personal experience with our audience?

91
00:07:49,255 --> 00:07:51,758
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that was a huge undertaking.

92
00:07:52,803 --> 00:08:04,034
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, you know, before the committee was formed, you know, I was focused on we got to get this charter review done and then it was really a big shift.

93
00:08:04,115 --> 00:08:15,926
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, oh, okay, we got the review because there was just so, it was so long in Medford just to get the review to happen before anybody could really start talking about, okay, now what, you know, what about the actual charter?

94
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:20,612
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a shift, but we did have help.

95
00:08:20,913 --> 00:08:29,524
[SPEAKER_01]: We had the Collins Center for Public Management, which is a nonprofit out of UMass Boston that helps a lot of municipalities with this kind of thing.

96
00:08:30,525 --> 00:08:33,829
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was very important to have that help.

97
00:08:36,131 --> 00:08:41,953
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, with their guidance we started looking at charters from around the state.

98
00:08:42,033 --> 00:08:57,538
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a template, a modern charter template that the Collins Center provided for us so we could sort of see, you know, what are the elements that are in a modern charter, which of course our current charter very much lacks.

99
00:08:59,579 --> 00:09:04,581
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was very important to us to do a lot of public engagement.

100
00:09:04,701 --> 00:09:09,203
[SPEAKER_01]: So we held three public information sessions at City Hall.

101
00:09:09,263 --> 00:09:12,284
[SPEAKER_01]: We created a survey that we distributed in five languages.

102
00:09:14,145 --> 00:09:19,348
[SPEAKER_01]: And we held over a dozen listening sessions around the city, which were great.

103
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:27,733
[SPEAKER_01]: We worked with different organizations like Housing Medford, the Chamber of Commerce, Medford Family Network.

104
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:30,235
[SPEAKER_01]: We went to the West Medford Community Center.

105
00:09:30,735 --> 00:09:33,457
[SPEAKER_01]: We just tried to cover as much ground as we could.

106
00:09:34,643 --> 00:09:37,625
[SPEAKER_01]: And we sort of collected all this feedback.

107
00:09:38,725 --> 00:09:49,630
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was one of my favorite parts of the process was, you know, the listening sessions and talking to people and sort of listening to their thoughts and what they wanted to see.

108
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:53,572
[SPEAKER_01]: And once we had this gathered, we sort of dug in.

109
00:09:54,452 --> 00:09:57,994
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we went through the charter article by article.

110
00:09:58,614 --> 00:09:59,795
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot of work.

111
00:09:59,835 --> 00:10:00,135
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

112
00:10:00,795 --> 00:10:02,396
[SPEAKER_01]: We did create subcommittees.

113
00:10:03,956 --> 00:10:06,757
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was pretty helpful.

114
00:10:06,797 --> 00:10:12,680
[SPEAKER_01]: So the subcommittee would like go in depth on a particular article and then bring it back to the whole committee.

115
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:21,803
[SPEAKER_01]: The Collins Center helped a lot with the drafting, but I think our committee was actually pretty ambitious and we did draft several of the sections on our own.

116
00:10:24,344 --> 00:10:28,966
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the important goals was getting it on the ballot this fall.

117
00:10:30,186 --> 00:10:31,507
[SPEAKER_01]: So in order to make that,

118
00:10:32,167 --> 00:10:34,390
[SPEAKER_01]: timeline we were working really hard at the end.

119
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:36,011
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot going on.

120
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,473
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

121
00:10:38,034 --> 00:10:48,806
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once we finished our final report, yeah, once we sort of hashed everything out, incorporated the feedback, we looked at studies and things like that.

122
00:10:50,648 --> 00:11:01,498
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we put it all together in a final report, submitted it to the mayor, and then she reviewed it and sent it to the council, and then it did get to the statehouse.

123
00:11:02,019 --> 00:11:04,822
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is projected to be on the ballot, which I'm very excited about.

124
00:11:04,882 --> 00:11:06,383
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is going to be on the ballot.

125
00:11:06,423 --> 00:11:10,247
[SPEAKER_01]: That was going to be my... Everything I hear is that it is going to be.

126
00:11:10,327 --> 00:11:11,688
[SPEAKER_01]: It just had its...

127
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:15,070
[SPEAKER_01]: third reading with the House.

128
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:20,111
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gone through the, it's almost through the Senate, so it should be at the Governor's desk very, very soon.

129
00:11:20,771 --> 00:11:21,452
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I hear.

130
00:11:22,112 --> 00:11:23,152
[SPEAKER_00]: Good news for Method.

131
00:11:23,632 --> 00:11:24,152
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

132
00:11:24,492 --> 00:11:35,454
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to, again, thank every member of the Charter Committee, because it was a lot of work, and people really donated their time, and we had a lot of fun, too.

133
00:11:35,674 --> 00:11:36,615
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it's all about.

134
00:11:37,475 --> 00:11:39,355
[SPEAKER_00]: Fun and hard work.

135
00:11:39,455 --> 00:11:40,375
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I always.

136
00:11:40,595 --> 00:11:43,096
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so I've got to ask you this question.

137
00:11:44,685 --> 00:11:56,491
[SPEAKER_00]: After two years of what we know was an intense effort, the Charter Study Committee proposed ward representation to the city council.

138
00:11:57,771 --> 00:12:06,955
[SPEAKER_00]: So the council initially rejected the proposal in favor of at-large representation.

139
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:17,253
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess the question is, what did you think when you heard the council's response?

140
00:12:17,373 --> 00:12:18,813
[SPEAKER_00]: You gave them a recommendation.

141
00:12:19,134 --> 00:12:25,296
[SPEAKER_00]: How did you feel when you got their response to your committee's recommendations, basically?

142
00:12:27,117 --> 00:12:36,743
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they proposed an alternate scheme of district representation which would have resulted in a majority at large council.

143
00:12:38,885 --> 00:12:43,948
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew that they would look at it and there was an expectation that there would be changes made.

144
00:12:44,128 --> 00:12:53,634
[SPEAKER_01]: That particular change, I was a bit surprised at because we didn't really have indication from many of the council members that that would be their view.

145
00:12:54,575 --> 00:13:07,351
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and the other thing that I was mostly concerned because if there was one thing that we heard over and over again in our public engagement piece, um, it was ward representation.

146
00:13:09,562 --> 00:13:11,343
[SPEAKER_01]: please give the city ward representation.

147
00:13:11,503 --> 00:13:15,966
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was very clear that that was what people wanted.

148
00:13:16,266 --> 00:13:25,832
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, knowing through the process, we learned about charter reviews in other cities and, you know, charter review isn't always guaranteed to succeed.

149
00:13:25,852 --> 00:13:31,296
[SPEAKER_01]: And often charter review will hinge on kind of like one major issue for the city.

150
00:13:31,476 --> 00:13:35,158
[SPEAKER_01]: For instance, in Medford, there actually was a charter commission in 1978.

151
00:13:37,605 --> 00:13:40,466
[SPEAKER_01]: that created a charter that got voted down.

152
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:44,808
[SPEAKER_01]: And the big issue then was mayor versus city manager.

153
00:13:45,829 --> 00:13:50,591
[SPEAKER_01]: And that particular charter commission didn't recommend that and the voters said no thank you.

154
00:13:51,151 --> 00:14:00,395
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in 1986 the voters did get the switch to the plan A mayor and replacing the city manager.

155
00:14:01,176 --> 00:14:06,098
[SPEAKER_01]: So to my mind the big issue that I heard from most people in the city,

156
00:14:07,033 --> 00:14:14,004
[SPEAKER_01]: was word representation and it didn't surprise me because before the committee even, it was something that I had been hearing about.

157
00:14:14,024 --> 00:14:16,388
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I felt like,

158
00:14:20,028 --> 00:14:25,355
[SPEAKER_01]: Just look, I tried to speak to the council about our findings.

159
00:14:27,478 --> 00:14:33,785
[SPEAKER_01]: Statistically, we are one of the only cities in Massachusetts to not have ward representation.

160
00:14:33,805 --> 00:14:38,551
[SPEAKER_01]: Our council is the smallest in the state for a city of our size.

161
00:14:41,433 --> 00:14:44,235
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 9 or 11 is the standard size.

162
00:14:44,355 --> 00:14:48,217
[SPEAKER_01]: And with the new charter we would have 11, 8 ward and 3 at large.

163
00:14:49,357 --> 00:14:54,720
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was also, in my mind was also the ultimate goal of success at the ballot box.

164
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,801
[SPEAKER_01]: And I felt like that was an important piece for that to happen.

165
00:14:58,902 --> 00:15:06,126
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it resulted in a good public discussion where the merits and the challenges of ward representation were discussed.

166
00:15:07,326 --> 00:15:28,606
[SPEAKER_01]: It was good to see people coming out to share their views communicate with the council and the mayor and I was just very glad that in the end that the council reached a compromise with the mayor that kept ward representation for council and I just want to reiterate that what you were actually doing was This is what the people want

167
00:15:29,486 --> 00:15:31,588
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what your hard work was really all about.

168
00:15:32,309 --> 00:15:34,210
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what the people want.

169
00:15:35,011 --> 00:15:35,251
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

170
00:15:35,271 --> 00:15:36,412
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's.

171
00:15:36,752 --> 00:15:42,397
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, and there was sort of, some people countered that with, well, we don't know what the people want.

172
00:15:42,417 --> 00:15:43,898
[SPEAKER_01]: There's 60,000 people in Medford.

173
00:15:44,018 --> 00:15:52,005
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is true, but we have to base it on what we were hearing from people.

174
00:15:52,105 --> 00:15:52,425
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

175
00:15:53,406 --> 00:15:54,807
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we did.

176
00:15:54,947 --> 00:15:56,989
[SPEAKER_00]: And you got a good sampling, in my opinion.

177
00:15:57,169 --> 00:15:57,349
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

178
00:15:57,689 --> 00:16:05,135
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know, I went to just about all the meetings up at City Hall, sat there and listened.

179
00:16:05,796 --> 00:16:10,740
[SPEAKER_00]: And boy, it generated a lot of, you know, what you want, conversation.

180
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:19,687
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to tell you, you got so many more people interested in the charter and learning about what was really,

181
00:16:20,808 --> 00:16:21,669
[SPEAKER_00]: going on in Method.

182
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:24,211
[SPEAKER_00]: And you got to take, I give you a lot of credit for that.

183
00:16:24,451 --> 00:16:25,832
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a difficult thing to do.

184
00:16:26,373 --> 00:16:29,135
[SPEAKER_00]: But yet they came to City Hall, large numbers.

185
00:16:29,935 --> 00:16:31,417
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was great.

186
00:16:31,917 --> 00:16:37,582
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there were some, like some people say, well, you didn't listen to the people on everything.

187
00:16:37,662 --> 00:16:46,389
[SPEAKER_01]: For instance, the mayor being on school committee, which became, I mean, that in the end, that was part of the compromise made between the mayor and the council.

188
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:53,031
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, what we did as a committee was we did take that public engagement very seriously.

189
00:16:53,111 --> 00:16:59,354
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also talked to, I mean, we talked to almost every sitting elected.

190
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:01,035
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked to prior electeds.

191
00:17:01,075 --> 00:17:02,615
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked to prior mayors.

192
00:17:02,675 --> 00:17:04,536
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked to city staff.

193
00:17:06,096 --> 00:17:07,977
[SPEAKER_01]: And we looked at a lot of things.

194
00:17:08,257 --> 00:17:14,260
[SPEAKER_01]: And the school committee subcommittee, which was chaired by Paulette Vander Kloot, looked very carefully

195
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:23,209
[SPEAKER_01]: chair, mayor being the chair, and you know, there were various reasons that the committee decided to recommend that.

196
00:17:23,729 --> 00:17:24,970
[SPEAKER_01]: It was changed, that's fine.

197
00:17:26,913 --> 00:17:33,600
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, term limits was another one, because term limits are very popular, but when we dug into the data,

198
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:42,943
[SPEAKER_01]: It just, it didn't make sense for various reasons to recommend it for council and school committee.

199
00:17:42,963 --> 00:17:44,464
[SPEAKER_01]: We did recommend it for mayor.

200
00:17:45,384 --> 00:17:54,048
[SPEAKER_01]: But I never heard the council complain about the fact that we didn't, well, there was one time actually, once they complained.

201
00:17:54,529 --> 00:17:58,170
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I mean, we did our best.

202
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:03,313
[SPEAKER_01]: We took the public engagement seriously, but we also had other information that we incorporated.

203
00:18:04,314 --> 00:18:10,681
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, it was a tremendous effort, and you ought to be congratulated.

204
00:18:10,941 --> 00:18:12,964
[SPEAKER_00]: You win the committee for what you did.

205
00:18:13,024 --> 00:18:14,145
[SPEAKER_00]: You did a great job.

206
00:18:14,465 --> 00:18:15,887
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the bottom line, really.

207
00:18:17,969 --> 00:18:19,191
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I hope everyone votes yes.

208
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:19,751
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

209
00:18:20,212 --> 00:18:20,872
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, they better.

210
00:18:21,132 --> 00:18:21,473
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

211
00:18:21,593 --> 00:18:24,615
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, without a doubt, I don't think there's any... Yeah.

212
00:18:24,695 --> 00:18:33,542
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to say one of the really important things in the new charter, if everybody votes yes and it gets voted through, is that we will have regular charter review.

213
00:18:33,602 --> 00:18:38,246
[SPEAKER_01]: So we will not go for decades with our charter languishing again.

214
00:18:38,606 --> 00:18:40,047
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of it, right?

215
00:18:40,067 --> 00:18:41,587
[SPEAKER_00]: That you are going to have the reviews.

216
00:18:41,607 --> 00:18:44,789
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's important because you made a few changes.

217
00:18:44,829 --> 00:18:47,090
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's try them out, see what happens.

218
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,290
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a key element.

219
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:52,512
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's not working the way we want, we can still change things.

220
00:18:52,552 --> 00:18:53,172
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.

221
00:18:53,312 --> 00:18:55,093
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, you guys covered every base.

222
00:18:55,413 --> 00:18:58,214
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, you hit a home run and covered everything.

223
00:18:58,234 --> 00:18:58,454
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

224
00:18:58,474 --> 00:18:59,254
[SPEAKER_01]: We did our best.

225
00:18:59,474 --> 00:18:59,754
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

226
00:19:00,415 --> 00:19:05,836
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could talk about zoning for another two hours, but unfortunately, we have to get off that.

227
00:19:07,137 --> 00:19:16,780
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and the next subject I really want to address, Milva, I don't have to tell you a lot of talk about zoning in Medford.

228
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:17,560
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

229
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,741
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's everywhere.

230
00:19:20,797 --> 00:19:21,938
[SPEAKER_00]: It's back and forth.

231
00:19:22,059 --> 00:19:23,160
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on and on.

232
00:19:24,021 --> 00:19:30,629
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, I guess the question is what is, you know, what's your position on the zoning?

233
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:35,751
[SPEAKER_01]: So my position is that the city does need a zoning overhaul.

234
00:19:36,491 --> 00:19:39,972
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not really a question and I don't think there's disagreement about that.

235
00:19:41,152 --> 00:19:51,975
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that there's been a lot of work done and we have these sort of visionary documents that have been guiding the process like the comprehensive plan and the housing production plan.

236
00:19:53,895 --> 00:19:56,416
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've had 18 months with an outside consultant.

237
00:19:56,456 --> 00:19:57,656
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot has been done.

238
00:19:59,076 --> 00:20:09,219
[SPEAKER_01]: But based on my conversation with residents and watching the community development board meetings, I think that slowing things down, especially with the residential zoning, was the right call.

239
00:20:11,099 --> 00:20:14,440
[SPEAKER_01]: The good news is that people are learning about it.

240
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,960
[SPEAKER_01]: They know about it now.

241
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:26,966
[SPEAKER_01]: For whatever reason that didn't happen, I prefer to look forward and look at the sort of the upside of that, which is that now we actually are hearing from people.

242
00:20:28,487 --> 00:20:32,569
[SPEAKER_01]: And they will have a chance to share specifics about their neighborhoods.

243
00:20:33,169 --> 00:20:39,133
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's important because, you know, the consultants have done their best, but they don't know every neighborhood in Medford.

244
00:20:39,773 --> 00:20:55,171
[SPEAKER_01]: So, now that we have residents aware and on board, they can share specifics about their neighborhood with the community development board and the council, and that can help guide the process to a good final outcome.

245
00:20:56,533 --> 00:20:57,434
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that...

246
00:20:59,646 --> 00:21:01,528
[SPEAKER_01]: That kind of detailed attention is important.

247
00:21:01,668 --> 00:21:05,192
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have to give that detailed attention to the squares and corridors.

248
00:21:06,053 --> 00:21:11,919
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the Community Development Board is working really hard on everything that's been sent over to them, which is a lot.

249
00:21:11,939 --> 00:21:12,420
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot.

250
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:16,284
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a tremendous amount.

251
00:21:17,685 --> 00:21:19,067
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's probably prudent

252
00:21:20,563 --> 00:21:24,545
[SPEAKER_01]: to take the time that it needs and look at details.

253
00:21:24,605 --> 00:21:30,447
[SPEAKER_01]: Like right now, I know one of the things they talked about at their last meeting was the boundaries of the squares, for instance.

254
00:21:30,787 --> 00:21:38,290
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that was a question that I asked a month or two ago, because I noticed that in my neighborhood,

255
00:21:39,546 --> 00:21:49,633
[SPEAKER_01]: the boundaries of the squares had been stretched so that some really beautiful old residential houses were potentially going to be zoned to mixed use.

256
00:21:49,873 --> 00:21:55,717
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're looking at those kinds of properties and those kinds of things and those details.

257
00:21:56,638 --> 00:21:59,379
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that's important.

258
00:21:59,479 --> 00:22:01,121
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm glad that that's happening.

259
00:22:02,221 --> 00:22:06,744
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that residents that I've talked to have been concerned about, several, is

260
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:09,406
[SPEAKER_01]: Teardowns in their neighborhood.

261
00:22:09,486 --> 00:22:21,713
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, and we have already seen yes, you know a house in South Medford That's slated to be torn down That's a beautiful perfectly wonderful house.

262
00:22:22,433 --> 00:22:30,238
[SPEAKER_01]: So and and people are worried about things like that so those those are some of the concerns I've heard and and

263
00:22:31,543 --> 00:22:37,831
[SPEAKER_01]: What I don't see disagreement on is I don't see disagreement on the need for new zoning and the need for new housing.

264
00:22:38,932 --> 00:22:41,234
[SPEAKER_01]: We particularly need commercial zoning.

265
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:49,884
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that the good news is that I think most everybody in the city agrees that this is important.

266
00:22:50,525 --> 00:22:50,885
[SPEAKER_00]: Very.

267
00:22:51,526 --> 00:22:53,707
[SPEAKER_01]: And that it needs to happen.

268
00:22:53,727 --> 00:22:58,091
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that anybody's trying to stop rezoning.

269
00:22:58,111 --> 00:23:08,458
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's just let's make sure that we're listening to people and figuring out what's really the best for Medford.

270
00:23:08,538 --> 00:23:10,440
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the right zoning for Medford?

271
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,581
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're always talking about people.

272
00:23:12,621 --> 00:23:13,162
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.

273
00:23:14,026 --> 00:23:15,027
[SPEAKER_00]: And no, it's nice.

274
00:23:15,287 --> 00:23:21,411
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I feel that way when, you know, more and more people are getting involved.

275
00:23:21,591 --> 00:23:23,473
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's affecting their neighborhoods.

276
00:23:23,573 --> 00:23:29,737
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, it's a good answer to the zoning issue.

277
00:23:29,817 --> 00:23:30,458
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is.

278
00:23:30,538 --> 00:23:34,501
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I don't think anyone is trying to stop it.

279
00:23:35,714 --> 00:23:40,638
[SPEAKER_00]: So much as we do need zoning Everybody wants what's best for Medford?

280
00:23:41,799 --> 00:23:43,781
[SPEAKER_00]: I you know the commercial the squares.

281
00:23:43,801 --> 00:23:46,143
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they they need to be they need some work.

282
00:23:46,423 --> 00:23:56,351
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they need some definitely and I'm glad It makes me happy when people get information and become involved and

283
00:23:56,531 --> 00:24:00,792
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's part of why we have you here and we have all the other candidates.

284
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:03,913
[SPEAKER_00]: It's to get information out.

285
00:24:04,293 --> 00:24:07,514
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we're doing a good thing for the city too.

286
00:24:07,554 --> 00:24:09,454
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I do.

287
00:24:10,375 --> 00:24:13,336
[SPEAKER_00]: I like getting people involved.

288
00:24:13,396 --> 00:24:15,096
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a big part of it.

289
00:24:16,556 --> 00:24:18,737
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's your position on zoning.

290
00:24:19,877 --> 00:24:21,878
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we gotta move on to

291
00:24:23,209 --> 00:24:31,748
[SPEAKER_00]: uh... how would you approach uh... you know getting economic growth started and uh... i guess growing you know methods tax base

292
00:24:32,792 --> 00:24:33,412
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we do?

293
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:36,073
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, that's a that's an excellent question.

294
00:24:36,233 --> 00:24:38,174
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a very important question.

295
00:24:38,874 --> 00:24:42,355
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also a tough question because we have limited options, right?

296
00:24:42,415 --> 00:24:42,516
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

297
00:24:43,536 --> 00:24:50,738
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what we were just talking about zoning, particularly in the commercial sectors, is is very important.

298
00:24:51,399 --> 00:24:58,241
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's maybe one of the biggest things we can do is to make Medford business friendly.

299
00:25:01,182 --> 00:25:09,787
[SPEAKER_01]: with the zoning process, looking at permitting processes, incentives, things like that, so that we can grow our commercial tax base.

300
00:25:10,167 --> 00:25:16,230
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lot of potential for that, and it just needs to be realized.

301
00:25:17,911 --> 00:25:23,414
[SPEAKER_01]: State aid and grants, identifying opportunities, I think the planning department works hard at that.

302
00:25:24,695 --> 00:25:38,024
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's something that, you know, the council could conceivably work with them on, is identifying those kinds of opportunities and making them happen.

303
00:25:39,525 --> 00:25:42,427
[SPEAKER_01]: We should be doing regular reviews of our fee schedules.

304
00:25:44,028 --> 00:25:51,153
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, we just, parking fees were just looked at, and I know some people might not like that, but our parking fees are very low.

305
00:25:52,894 --> 00:26:01,358
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I personally will, you know, look and say, okay, well, will I get the same number of permits this year?

306
00:26:01,638 --> 00:26:03,099
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't know if I will.

307
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:04,940
[SPEAKER_01]: But I might.

308
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:11,964
[SPEAKER_01]: But, I mean, everybody will have to weigh that decision, but things like, you know,

309
00:26:12,924 --> 00:26:28,248
[SPEAKER_01]: Permitting fees just every and also looking at our contracts like I mean even the shovel year, which is amazing It's also Been a great business opportunity and it's proven to be highly successful.

310
00:26:28,348 --> 00:26:34,389
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe renegotiating some of these contracts where we have now a proven track record and

311
00:26:35,309 --> 00:27:00,698
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, I know that this is something that's being looked at, but linkage fees, developer fees, so basically looking at fees, looking at opportunities for state grants, beefing up our commercial sectors, and renegotiating the pilot program with Tufts, looking at, you know, where we can, so those are some of the ways I think.

312
00:27:00,738 --> 00:27:01,558
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all good ones.

313
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:03,602
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the word linkage fees.

314
00:27:03,643 --> 00:27:07,513
[SPEAKER_00]: They seem to have disappeared, but I like that you use that, really.

315
00:27:07,733 --> 00:27:09,358
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's one of those things that...

316
00:27:11,262 --> 00:27:16,065
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, we used to do good with, but it doesn't seem like that's, you know, going so great anymore.

317
00:27:16,105 --> 00:27:17,406
[SPEAKER_00]: But thank you for that answer.

318
00:27:18,206 --> 00:27:18,986
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate it.

319
00:27:20,487 --> 00:27:23,529
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, people have heard you.

320
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:31,253
[SPEAKER_00]: You got, you know, I think you did a, you know, good job getting what you believe in out there.

321
00:27:31,273 --> 00:27:38,377
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have anything else, you know, that you want people to know about your platform?

322
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:42,151
[SPEAKER_01]: I am a proponent of affordable housing.

323
00:27:42,512 --> 00:27:48,055
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I, I think that it's great that this, that we have an affordable housing trust now.

324
00:27:48,395 --> 00:27:50,756
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, then we need to figure out how to fund it.

325
00:27:50,976 --> 00:28:01,622
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have, uh, the affordable housing trust has a board that put out recently a great comprehensive report with ideas for that, including a community land trust, which I think would also be great.

326
00:28:01,662 --> 00:28:07,085
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be, um, like sort of a city owned property that would be available to,

327
00:28:09,485 --> 00:28:13,406
[SPEAKER_01]: Build affordable housing on so and that would stay affordable, right?

328
00:28:13,446 --> 00:28:15,426
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it'd be nice a city-owned.

329
00:28:15,446 --> 00:28:19,347
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean that's So I think that's those are important.

330
00:28:19,367 --> 00:28:33,330
[SPEAKER_01]: So and and also in the affordability issue I think looking at a residential exemption for taxpayers for homeowners would be a good thing to investigate Other cities have that Malden has it.

331
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:33,950
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they do and

332
00:28:35,051 --> 00:28:43,576
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is basically where if you live in your property, then you are eligible to apply for an exemption to your tax bill.

333
00:28:45,517 --> 00:28:55,823
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that climate resiliency is important, and we have a great climate action and adaptation plan, so I think keeping an eye on that and making sure we're meeting the benchmarks is great.

334
00:28:56,503 --> 00:28:59,345
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of great things have already happened.

335
00:28:59,545 --> 00:29:06,569
[SPEAKER_01]: Expanding the tree canopy, and these things are great for climate resiliency, but they also improve people's quality of life.

336
00:29:06,669 --> 00:29:09,711
[SPEAKER_01]: So the tree canopy is going to make a nicer city.

337
00:29:10,251 --> 00:29:14,734
[SPEAKER_01]: The bike share program, I think, has been great for people.

338
00:29:16,575 --> 00:29:23,961
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think safe streets are important, so infrastructure improvements, things like that.

339
00:29:25,042 --> 00:29:28,785
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also am a big supporter of the arts.

340
00:29:30,367 --> 00:29:36,432
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to, as a counselor, advocate for the installation of a city arts coordinator.

341
00:29:37,032 --> 00:29:42,557
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that I hear from people is we have so many great arts organizations, and we do.

342
00:29:42,897 --> 00:29:44,118
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you do, and that's it.

343
00:29:44,158 --> 00:29:44,698
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.

344
00:29:44,738 --> 00:29:46,019
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we do.

345
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:52,542
[SPEAKER_01]: But part of sort of what happens is we don't, you know, the people are picking up the slack, kind of.

346
00:29:53,082 --> 00:29:57,444
[SPEAKER_01]: So a city arts coordinator could be kind of a unifying, an anchor, basically.

347
00:29:57,484 --> 00:29:58,405
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, yeah.

348
00:29:59,165 --> 00:30:19,905
[SPEAKER_01]: And support the arts council and sort of unify arts in the city So I and that's what I've heard from the arts community that that's something that they would like nice Um, and I also would like to advocate for an lgbtq plus commission Okay, which would be um, just a you know, one of another one of the city's volunteer commissions, right?

349
00:30:20,286 --> 00:30:20,346
[SPEAKER_01]: um

350
00:30:20,806 --> 00:30:23,028
[SPEAKER_01]: to sort of advocate for that community.

351
00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:24,629
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are some of the things.

352
00:30:24,709 --> 00:30:25,429
[SPEAKER_00]: All good stuff.

353
00:30:27,831 --> 00:30:32,514
[SPEAKER_00]: So now, you know, we got to learn about your platform.

354
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:34,925
[SPEAKER_00]: campaign events.

355
00:30:36,646 --> 00:30:38,546
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's a big part of it.

356
00:30:38,706 --> 00:30:41,467
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's a part we don't want to do, but we have to.

357
00:30:41,927 --> 00:30:47,029
[SPEAKER_00]: Any upcoming campaign events you want people to know about, put it out there.

358
00:30:47,249 --> 00:30:49,609
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I have a couple of really fun ones coming up.

359
00:30:49,970 --> 00:31:01,493
[SPEAKER_01]: I love music, I said that, and I have musicians in my family, and so there's a couple of events coming up at Mrs. Murphy's, which is the Irish pub on Salem Street.

360
00:31:02,353 --> 00:31:05,734
[SPEAKER_01]: on August 29th, which is a Friday, from 6 to 8.

361
00:31:07,055 --> 00:31:14,237
[SPEAKER_01]: We will be there with Celtic music, a great fiddler named Alistair White, and guitarist Eric McDonald.

362
00:31:15,998 --> 00:31:23,401
[SPEAKER_01]: Alistair is Scottish, and he used to be in the Battlefield Band, which if anybody knows Celtic music, that's a very big name.

363
00:31:24,081 --> 00:31:25,983
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's going to be really fun.

364
00:31:26,403 --> 00:31:27,364
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be there from 6 to 8.

365
00:31:28,364 --> 00:31:29,445
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on over.

366
00:31:30,146 --> 00:31:31,286
[SPEAKER_01]: Order off the menu.

367
00:31:31,967 --> 00:31:32,788
[SPEAKER_01]: Chat with us.

368
00:31:33,208 --> 00:31:35,590
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, talk to me about my platform.

369
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:36,190
[SPEAKER_01]: Get to know me.

370
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:37,151
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to see you.

371
00:31:38,131 --> 00:31:43,255
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another one at Mrs. Murphy's on September 7th, which is a Sunday from 3 to 5 p.m.

372
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:45,417
[SPEAKER_01]: with the Shereem Klezmer duo.

373
00:31:46,618 --> 00:31:50,701
[SPEAKER_01]: And Klezmer music is Eastern European Jewish folk music, and it's really fun.

374
00:31:50,721 --> 00:31:51,481
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds interesting.

375
00:31:51,501 --> 00:31:52,182
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really fun.

376
00:31:53,062 --> 00:31:57,126
[SPEAKER_01]: That will be a clarinet player and an accordion player, both who live in Medford.

377
00:31:57,907 --> 00:31:59,108
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I'm excited about those.

378
00:31:59,228 --> 00:32:00,529
[SPEAKER_01]: Very nice, very nice.

379
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:03,111
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife was a singer, by the way.

380
00:32:03,151 --> 00:32:05,494
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to throw a plug in for my wife Daria.

381
00:32:06,154 --> 00:32:07,355
[SPEAKER_00]: She sang at St.

382
00:32:07,395 --> 00:32:09,797
[SPEAKER_00]: Raphael's for years, weddings.

383
00:32:10,578 --> 00:32:12,580
[SPEAKER_00]: She sang at a piano bar for years.

384
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:13,241
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's nice.

385
00:32:13,281 --> 00:32:15,322
[SPEAKER_00]: She did very well with the singing.

386
00:32:15,523 --> 00:32:16,103
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.

387
00:32:16,403 --> 00:32:17,564
[SPEAKER_00]: Ian, my daughter,

388
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:19,560
[SPEAKER_00]: has my voice.

389
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:22,102
[SPEAKER_00]: So she's like a great singer.

390
00:32:22,302 --> 00:32:24,184
[SPEAKER_00]: She's all over the place singing.

391
00:32:25,145 --> 00:32:26,125
[SPEAKER_00]: My daughter Margaret.

392
00:32:26,165 --> 00:32:29,308
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's nice.

393
00:32:30,689 --> 00:32:31,049
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

394
00:32:31,129 --> 00:32:33,191
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a question we ask everybody.

395
00:32:35,533 --> 00:32:39,757
[SPEAKER_00]: Least and most favorite things to do in Method?

396
00:32:40,493 --> 00:32:41,474
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's hard.

397
00:32:41,534 --> 00:32:45,136
[SPEAKER_01]: Thinking of the least favorite thing is hard, because I'm like, oh, there's nothing I really don't like to do.

398
00:32:45,196 --> 00:32:47,457
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I thought, oh, OK, driving.

399
00:32:47,737 --> 00:32:58,703
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably my least favorite, because the traffic, so many people use Medford as a cut through, which is something I would like to sit down and think about.

400
00:32:58,843 --> 00:33:02,925
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there some way to discourage that?

401
00:33:03,025 --> 00:33:06,407
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, so I would say that's probably my least favorite, driving.

402
00:33:07,748 --> 00:33:08,689
[SPEAKER_01]: My most favorite?

403
00:33:09,829 --> 00:33:12,551
[SPEAKER_01]: That's much easier, although hard to pick one.

404
00:33:12,571 --> 00:33:14,072
[SPEAKER_01]: So I probably picked a few.

405
00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:16,534
[SPEAKER_01]: You could pick a few, that's fine.

406
00:33:16,634 --> 00:33:20,117
[SPEAKER_01]: The library is one of my favorite things, go to the library.

407
00:33:20,437 --> 00:33:27,983
[SPEAKER_01]: Our second poet laureate Vijaya Sundaram runs a poetry club there and I love going to her poetry club.

408
00:33:28,023 --> 00:33:32,066
[SPEAKER_01]: She also runs a poetry open mic at the Arts Collaborative Medford.

409
00:33:33,727 --> 00:33:36,630
[SPEAKER_01]: So I love those things and I love the Arts Collaborative Medford.

410
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:38,291
[SPEAKER_01]: I also love the farmer's market.

411
00:33:40,049 --> 00:33:46,571
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing I love to do in Medford is my husband and I have a tandem bike, which is like a bicycle built for two.

412
00:33:47,471 --> 00:33:49,051
[SPEAKER_01]: So we like to ride that.

413
00:33:49,071 --> 00:33:55,113
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we ride it over to the Mystic Lakes and look for the eagles and the herons.

414
00:33:56,633 --> 00:34:00,374
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, so that's definitely one of my favorite things.

415
00:34:00,654 --> 00:34:02,174
[SPEAKER_00]: Very nice, very nice.

416
00:34:04,015 --> 00:34:07,736
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I gotta ask you one more and then

417
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:11,212
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be the last question.

418
00:34:11,712 --> 00:34:13,794
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the most important one, Milva.

419
00:34:13,935 --> 00:34:14,255
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

420
00:34:14,435 --> 00:34:14,856
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay?

421
00:34:15,777 --> 00:34:25,668
[SPEAKER_00]: So if people want to reach you, if they want to know more about you, if they want to look, you know, look into what you're doing or what's going on, how do they go about doing it?

422
00:34:26,835 --> 00:34:33,458
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a website, www.milva4medford.com.
