1
00:00:02,695 --> 00:00:06,278
The 31st regular meeting of the Medford City Council will come to order.

2
00:00:06,778 --> 00:00:08,659
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,301
Councilor Camuso?

4
00:00:10,441 --> 00:00:10,721
Present.

5
00:00:12,963 --> 00:00:13,863
Councilor Caviello?

6
00:00:13,883 --> 00:00:14,024
Present.

7
00:00:14,884 --> 00:00:15,505
Councilor Knight?

8
00:00:17,186 --> 00:00:17,686
Present.

9
00:00:19,488 --> 00:00:20,428
Vice President Langel-Kern?

10
00:00:20,448 --> 00:00:20,609
Present.

11
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:22,530
Councilor Mox?

12
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:22,690
Present.

13
00:00:23,891 --> 00:00:24,372
Councilor Penta?

14
00:00:24,392 --> 00:00:24,572
Present.

15
00:00:26,413 --> 00:00:27,334
President DelaRusso?

16
00:00:28,975 --> 00:00:32,337
Present, seven present, none absent, please rise to salute the flag.

17
00:00:34,318 --> 00:00:46,585
I, with the pledge of allegiance, do pledge the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

18
00:00:55,326 --> 00:00:57,127
Motions, orders, and resolutions.

19
00:00:57,147 --> 00:01:00,950
15-708 offered by Vice President Lungel-Kern.

20
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:14,418
Be it resolved that the Medford City Council be updated with regard to the implementation of the 311 system or an equivalent of it, C-Clip or C-Click, that was supposed to be implemented to date.

21
00:01:14,999 --> 00:01:24,485
After hearing at the great debate that such a system was contracted to be implemented, it would be nice if the council that has been pushing for such a program

22
00:01:24,935 --> 00:01:28,437
for years be up to date as such.

23
00:01:28,977 --> 00:01:29,918
Madam Vice President.

24
00:01:30,318 --> 00:01:31,859
Thank you, President De La Russo.

25
00:01:32,219 --> 00:01:36,041
I guess I'd like to begin first, because I know we have Mr. Veneziano in the audience.

26
00:01:36,061 --> 00:01:43,465
And I just want to say what a great job the Chevalier and Chamber of Commerce put on last Wednesday for the mayoral debate.

27
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:46,066
It was, in my opinion, historic.

28
00:01:46,327 --> 00:01:47,687
It went off without a hitch.

29
00:01:47,727 --> 00:01:48,408
It was fair.

30
00:01:49,128 --> 00:01:51,890
It was run so smoothly, and it went so well.

31
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:53,791
So I just want to thank you for such a great night.

32
00:01:55,145 --> 00:01:56,006
in Medford's history.

33
00:01:56,906 --> 00:02:01,869
With that being said, everything that came out of the debate, I think, on both sides was very positive.

34
00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:22,202
But the one thing that I kind of, you know, was concerned about was the fact that the 311 system that this council has been pushing for for years now, three or four years, I know that I personally have had four or five resolutions on with regards to the 311 system being implemented, or something equivalent there, too.

35
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:23,965
like Somerville has.

36
00:02:24,005 --> 00:02:25,566
Somerville has a three-in-one system.

37
00:02:25,906 --> 00:02:34,971
I did speak to the Somerville OCD board and the DPW department and got some information, and we spoke about it live on the council floor.

38
00:02:35,451 --> 00:02:44,457
And that's something that I believe should have been implemented with or right before the new DPW department opened their new facility.

39
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:51,981
I think they go hand in hand, having the community be able to make a call, know that they're

40
00:02:52,702 --> 00:02:59,965
their issue or their concern is going to be put on a list and they're going to get a response with regards to when it's going to be fixed or how and how it's going to be fixed.

41
00:03:00,325 --> 00:03:01,425
I think that's very important.

42
00:03:01,825 --> 00:03:10,628
And what I found out from the debate was that the city signed a contract with regards to this type of system.

43
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:12,149
I couldn't recall.

44
00:03:12,189 --> 00:03:18,931
I couldn't, you know, I was trying to take notes of the debate, whether it was C-clip or C-click, but that the city signed a contract months ago.

45
00:03:18,951 --> 00:03:21,652
I have to assume that that was before May.

46
00:03:22,338 --> 00:03:25,939
and that this is coming to our community.

47
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:36,923
I just find it odd that the council has voted for this numerous times, seven to nothing for the last four years, and we have to hear about it and learn about it the night of a big debate.

48
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:46,527
And we had, I guess, no respect to be able to let us know what the program entailed, how it's going to work, when it's going to be put into place, how it's going to be operated.

49
00:03:46,907 --> 00:03:49,728
I feel like if we could get an update from our

50
00:03:52,058 --> 00:03:57,659
I believe the best person to answer the question would be Louise Miller.

51
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:03,060
She's the one that's been working with the council and really trying to update us as much as she can.

52
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,982
But I think this is something that I'd like a memo with regards to what is going on.

53
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:14,463
You know, we were promised a dog park come October 2015.

54
00:04:14,623 --> 00:04:15,583
There's no dog park.

55
00:04:15,623 --> 00:04:18,564
We have an account for it and still is no dog park.

56
00:04:18,584 --> 00:04:19,344
We're getting calls.

57
00:04:19,946 --> 00:04:26,871
people think they've been lied to, and then now we have something that the council's been pushing for for years being implemented that we don't even know about.

58
00:04:26,931 --> 00:04:35,677
We haven't had any, besides what we've said on the council floor, we haven't had any public meetings, we haven't had any input discussion with the administration, and I think that's important.

59
00:04:35,717 --> 00:04:44,183
I think we're the ones that get the calls and help people every day, whether it be a pothole, a curb cut, a, you know, trash wasn't picked up,

60
00:04:44,496 --> 00:04:52,582
We're the ones that are pushing for this 301 system or some sort of E-Click system, C-Click system for many, many years.

61
00:04:52,642 --> 00:04:54,444
I feel like we should have known about it.

62
00:04:54,504 --> 00:04:59,427
We should have got updates and been apprised of when it was being implemented and how it was being implemented.

63
00:04:59,948 --> 00:05:05,352
I guess there's no other ways I can say it, but I was just very disappointed.

64
00:05:05,392 --> 00:05:07,894
That was the one thing I was disappointed to hear about.

65
00:05:08,654 --> 00:05:11,977
Happy that the contract was signed, but disappointed that we had no

66
00:05:12,481 --> 00:05:26,430
real input besides what we've said behind the rail, just trying to push and fight for the program in general so that there can be accountability and transparency within city government, within the, you know, and I think it's going to help the Department of Public Works as well.

67
00:05:27,311 --> 00:05:36,437
It's going to help them, it's going to help let the council and the city realize how much they do do for the community and maybe we need to staff the DPW better.

68
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:41,714
I think it's important and I really want to see it come to fruition.

69
00:05:41,754 --> 00:05:49,037
I really want to get updated with regards to this program and see when, and I also want to know, you know, when the contract was signed because we were never apprised.

70
00:05:49,938 --> 00:05:58,241
So on the motion of Vice President Longo-Kern that the director of Louise Miller.

71
00:05:58,661 --> 00:05:59,702
Budget and personnel please.

72
00:05:59,722 --> 00:06:02,883
Budget and personnel, et cetera, report back to the council.

73
00:06:03,367 --> 00:06:08,708
Because she is also serving as the... She's still the purchasing agent of the city.

74
00:06:08,728 --> 00:06:09,308
Purchasing agent.

75
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:15,030
So she would definitely be the one to answer our questions with regards to if an RFP was signed or what type of contract was signed.

76
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:18,411
It was announced last Wednesday as a surprise to me.

77
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:22,071
So yes, if she could report back to the council, that would be very helpful.

78
00:06:22,491 --> 00:06:22,832
Very good.

79
00:06:22,872 --> 00:06:24,212
On that motion, all those in favor?

80
00:06:24,792 --> 00:06:25,512
All those opposed?

81
00:06:25,572 --> 00:06:27,693
Motion carried.

82
00:06:27,713 --> 00:06:33,074
15-709, offered by Councillor Knight, be it resolved that the Metro City Council congratulate Richard and Catherine Grant

83
00:06:33,568 --> 00:06:39,873
On the momentous occasion of the 50th wedding anniversary, happy anniversary, Councilor Knight.

84
00:06:40,334 --> 00:06:41,635
Mr. President, thank you very much.

85
00:06:41,695 --> 00:06:43,216
I think the resolution speaks for itself.

86
00:06:44,117 --> 00:06:55,306
The grand family of long bed fixtures in the city of Medford, and I'm proud to call Richard and Catherine friends, and I'm glad to see that they've had 50 years of wedded bliss, and I'd ask the council to join with me in wishing them a happy anniversary.

87
00:06:55,586 --> 00:06:56,867
Congratulations on that motion.

88
00:06:56,887 --> 00:06:57,568
All those in favor?

89
00:06:57,968 --> 00:06:58,649
All those opposed?

90
00:06:58,729 --> 00:06:59,349
Motion carries.

91
00:06:59,369 --> 00:07:02,292
15-712 offered by Councilor Caraviello.

92
00:07:02,739 --> 00:07:09,686
Be it resolved that the Medford City Council discuss the effects of Chevalier Auditorium can have on the Medford Square District.

93
00:07:10,066 --> 00:07:10,947
Councilor Caviello.

94
00:07:11,267 --> 00:07:12,088
Thank you, Mr. President.

95
00:07:12,469 --> 00:07:17,393
Mr. President, last week, we had a good debate down at Chevalier Auditorium.

96
00:07:18,154 --> 00:07:19,375
Close to 1,000 people came.

97
00:07:20,837 --> 00:07:27,263
And after the debate, probably 300 of them came down to Medford Square.

98
00:07:28,032 --> 00:07:42,298
both to Salvatore's, Carol's, Colleen's, Il Giusto, and all the restaurants in the square, and even outside of the square, all benefited from the people that came to Chevalier for a good evening.

99
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:56,445
And that wasn't an evening of what we would call entertainment, but just imagine, Mr. President, if there was once a month a name entertainer that came to Chevalier Auditorium, the effect that that would have in the square.

100
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,482
to all the businesses that surround there.

101
00:08:00,982 --> 00:08:10,867
With just the meals, taxes, and whatever else they do, before the show, after the show, it goes to show, if there's something there, people will come, Mr. President.

102
00:08:11,687 --> 00:08:12,587
And it's time that

103
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:28,043
The new administration coming in looks at that building hard and hopefully there'll be some funding for seed money for that group so they can go out and bid for some name entertainment similar to Lowell and Lynn and all those other fine facilities.

104
00:08:28,484 --> 00:08:42,269
So again, I would ask that we send something to the mayor asking for in the new budget seed money for the Chevalier Auditorium and their program to get entertainers in here.

105
00:08:43,004 --> 00:08:44,905
Very good, so on the motion of Councilor Caviello.

106
00:08:45,306 --> 00:08:46,126
Ma'am, welcome.

107
00:08:46,146 --> 00:08:48,008
Please state your name and address for the record.

108
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,730
Hi, I'm Jean Martin, 10 Cumming Street, Medford, Madison.

109
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,172
I'm a big proponent of the theater, as you know.

110
00:08:54,673 --> 00:08:58,235
As you know, I also push your buttons, but this is something that pushes my buttons.

111
00:09:00,857 --> 00:09:01,678
I love the theater.

112
00:09:01,918 --> 00:09:02,639
I love the acts.

113
00:09:02,899 --> 00:09:10,745
I'm going to two of them before Christmas, but the way it's being run with the religious groups in there on Sunday mornings has to go.

114
00:09:11,528 --> 00:09:15,410
It is inappropriate for religious groups to look at that as if it's a church.

115
00:09:16,371 --> 00:09:24,355
It is being rented and looked at as if it is a church by two groups of people, and it needs to come to a close.

116
00:09:24,715 --> 00:09:31,099
If we value this city as this asset, then we need to kick in the money for it.

117
00:09:31,739 --> 00:09:34,280
I don't know how, but we need to kick in the money for it the right way.

118
00:09:34,921 --> 00:09:37,262
If that's the case, and I've already told these folks,

119
00:09:38,003 --> 00:09:45,349
We need to have, we can open up all the buildings, whether it's the South Manfred Fire Station and hold it open for other religious events.

120
00:09:45,949 --> 00:09:54,396
We could rent out the schools for Buddhist, Methodist, Catholics, Jewish, every other religion under the sun.

121
00:09:54,756 --> 00:10:02,522
These folks can practice their religion and they can say things that are very controversial in this city, in that public space, in that public building.

122
00:10:02,922 --> 00:10:04,964
They can say a woman should submit to her husband.

123
00:10:05,344 --> 00:10:07,586
They can say that homosexuality is a sin.

124
00:10:08,158 --> 00:10:10,879
They can say anything because they have the religious right to do so.

125
00:10:11,539 --> 00:10:15,660
We need to be very, very careful of how we run our buildings.

126
00:10:16,081 --> 00:10:17,061
I love the Chevalier.

127
00:10:17,221 --> 00:10:18,401
I want to see it be run right.

128
00:10:20,182 --> 00:10:22,283
And that's all I want to say is that that needs to go.

129
00:10:22,303 --> 00:10:27,164
And if we value this piece of property as we should, we need to come up with the money for it.

130
00:10:27,304 --> 00:10:27,624
Thank you.

131
00:10:28,184 --> 00:10:28,845
Thank you, Jean.

132
00:10:30,065 --> 00:10:30,565
Good evening.

133
00:10:30,685 --> 00:10:31,385
Come on up.

134
00:10:31,445 --> 00:10:32,966
Please state your name and address for the record.

135
00:10:33,362 --> 00:10:35,684
Susan Fairchild, 31 Hillcroft Park.

136
00:10:36,885 --> 00:10:46,753
I am a new commissioner on the Chevalier Commission and also a new board member of the Friends of the Chevalier in the past six, seven months.

137
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:58,062
And I want to say that I too believe that this is an amazing asset for the city and we've been able to make a lot of changes in the past

138
00:10:58,782 --> 00:11:00,862
Six months or so, we have a whole new website.

139
00:11:01,423 --> 00:11:03,883
We have a lot of new things, shows that are coming in.

140
00:11:03,923 --> 00:11:06,864
We are trying to do the monthly entertainment.

141
00:11:07,284 --> 00:11:08,084
It is expensive.

142
00:11:08,644 --> 00:11:12,725
It is expensive to bring in shows that will bring in 900 people.

143
00:11:13,225 --> 00:11:17,486
And so, I fully would, certainly would support the seed money for the theater.

144
00:11:17,926 --> 00:11:24,767
The theater also has a lot of the physical wear and tear that we haven't really been able to

145
00:11:25,607 --> 00:11:27,848
keep up with as much probably as we should.

146
00:11:28,309 --> 00:11:41,297
And so in terms of being able to attract additional shows and additional rentals into the theater, then we definitely would need some money for the building maintenance and even a little bit more updating beyond the maintenance.

147
00:11:41,957 --> 00:11:59,845
So, I fully support, certainly, the concept, and thank you very much, and would be happy to provide any information that anyone's looking for, for, you know, the costs, what we have on our wish list, what we have on our budget, as well as sort of what we're trying to budget towards in terms of making some of the improvements.

148
00:12:00,926 --> 00:12:01,566
Okay?

149
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:01,966
Thank you.

150
00:12:02,146 --> 00:12:02,866
Thank you, Susan.

151
00:12:04,447 --> 00:12:05,147
Good evening, sir.

152
00:12:05,227 --> 00:12:07,208
Please state your name and address for the record.

153
00:12:07,609 --> 00:12:08,689
Thank you, Mr. President.

154
00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:09,870
Robert Capucci, 71 Evans Street.

155
00:12:11,615 --> 00:12:20,477
Just a question for Miss Fairchild, who just spoke, if she could come back for the folks watching at home and give us the new website address.

156
00:12:20,817 --> 00:12:28,898
Because I know a lot of people, after having been at that debate, like myself, who had never been in the Chevalier before, would like to know as much as possible.

157
00:12:29,218 --> 00:12:31,679
Maybe there's volunteer opportunities and whatnot.

158
00:12:38,638 --> 00:12:41,299
John Costas, 25 Salem Street in Medford.

159
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:45,320
The website is chevaliertheatre.com.

160
00:12:46,461 --> 00:12:47,241
You can Google it.

161
00:12:47,281 --> 00:12:47,881
It will come up.

162
00:12:48,261 --> 00:12:50,142
And then you can just navigate it from there.

163
00:12:51,863 --> 00:12:56,944
The DVD from the debate, the fantastic, great debate, was given to City Hall.

164
00:12:57,404 --> 00:13:01,726
So sometime, hopefully today, they will be running it on the government channel.

165
00:13:02,846 --> 00:13:04,767
I am working on the YouTube version.

166
00:13:05,307 --> 00:13:07,668
And what will happen is once I get, if they'll

167
00:13:08,153 --> 00:13:23,976
If it'll take two hours, I'm going to upload it to YouTube, and then a link will go out to Chamber of Commerce and everybody else, so you can click on it, and then you could see the highlights of the debate, to go along with Councilor Caviello regarding the benefit to Medford Square.

168
00:13:25,316 --> 00:13:36,338
I know I sound like a broken record after all these years, but everything we do at Chevalier Theatre, no matter what it is, from a major show to a dance recital, everybody generates

169
00:13:37,161 --> 00:13:39,082
goes to Medford Square to buy stuff.

170
00:13:40,023 --> 00:13:41,004
Mostly Dunkin' Donuts.

171
00:13:41,944 --> 00:13:45,487
But the larger shows, they generate a lot of revenue for the city.

172
00:13:46,127 --> 00:13:49,469
And some of the shows we've had, they require hotel rooms.

173
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:51,831
And we filled up a hotel.

174
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:56,994
So again, the city now ranks not just meal tax, they also get hotel tax.

175
00:13:57,914 --> 00:14:01,216
So one thing we really need is we need operating money.

176
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:07,113
All good theaters or any building or any organization needs an operating budget.

177
00:14:07,953 --> 00:14:23,362
And hopefully in the new administration, we will get an operating budget to not only promote the larger shows such as Lynn Auditorium does now, but to bring in staff and to bring in more, generate more revenue for the square in the taxes.

178
00:14:23,383 --> 00:14:30,667
Because it may seem like a lot of money if you say, you know, half a million dollars for an operating budget for a year, but

179
00:14:31,472 --> 00:14:46,415
If you look at how many millions of dollars the city generates in taxes, and that's Lynn's, you know, and Lowell's claim to fame, they'll make so much money in taxes and meal tax and stuff that everybody benefits from it.

180
00:14:47,296 --> 00:14:52,877
So I support Councilor Caviello's, you know, resolution or whatever to help us out.

181
00:14:54,177 --> 00:14:54,477
Thank you.

182
00:14:55,658 --> 00:14:56,398
Thank you, John.

183
00:14:56,918 --> 00:14:57,658
Point of information.

184
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,461
Vice President Longo, current.

185
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:00,801
Thank you, President DeLaRusso.

186
00:15:00,881 --> 00:15:04,403
Point of clarification, you said that the tape of the debate went to City Hall?

187
00:15:04,783 --> 00:15:06,604
The DVD went to City Hall this morning.

188
00:15:07,104 --> 00:15:09,885
I heard through the grapevine that it wasn't going to be played.

189
00:15:09,925 --> 00:15:10,545
Have you heard that?

190
00:15:10,705 --> 00:15:13,086
They're not going to play it because it wasn't educational?

191
00:15:13,527 --> 00:15:18,269
Well, my understanding is they didn't want to play it on the educational channel, which is 15.

192
00:15:19,149 --> 00:15:22,870
But as far as I haven't heard otherwise that it would be played on the government channel.

193
00:15:23,831 --> 00:15:25,792
If somebody knows something other than that,

194
00:15:27,286 --> 00:15:27,946
I'm not aware of it.

195
00:15:28,826 --> 00:15:29,667
Thank you, counselors.

196
00:15:30,267 --> 00:15:30,827
Thank you, John.

197
00:15:31,007 --> 00:15:32,367
Thank you.

198
00:15:32,507 --> 00:15:33,928
Chair recognizes Councilor Penta.

199
00:15:35,988 --> 00:15:37,329
I'll let the gentleman speak first.

200
00:15:40,109 --> 00:15:42,370
John Benisiano, 65 Crocker Road, Medford.

201
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:46,531
I know that topic about the debate not being on TV is going to be an issue.

202
00:15:47,271 --> 00:15:48,991
Just a couple of things.

203
00:15:49,271 --> 00:15:55,353
What's making the theater a highlight all of a sudden is the fact that it's now

204
00:15:55,935 --> 00:15:57,076
there's awareness about it.

205
00:15:57,536 --> 00:16:00,558
Gentleman just said he hasn't been there in I don't know how long he's lived in the city.

206
00:16:01,299 --> 00:16:11,205
But one of the ideas about having the debate when I was proposing it to the chamber was to have it at Chevalier, because it was killing two birds with one stone.

207
00:16:11,246 --> 00:16:12,586
And we got everybody in the theater.

208
00:16:13,127 --> 00:16:15,368
And of course, the awareness of what the theater can do.

209
00:16:15,609 --> 00:16:20,972
What I found really interesting, and I was going to bring it up the night of the debate, but I didn't really know the crowd.

210
00:16:20,992 --> 00:16:21,933
I was going to make a joke.

211
00:16:22,493 --> 00:16:24,355
But I didn't know if a bus of 1,200 people showed up.

212
00:16:25,678 --> 00:16:27,319
or people all of a sudden found parking.

213
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:36,485
Because if you really think about it, the place was crowded outside at 6 PM, plus everybody that was marching outside in front.

214
00:16:36,505 --> 00:16:37,306
We opened the doors at 6.

215
00:16:38,167 --> 00:16:47,133
And by the time I got on to stage about 7.05, and I looked out, and the first floor holds, if I'm corrected, is 1,200 seats, 600 in the balcony.

216
00:16:47,433 --> 00:16:51,256
And I could not see an empty seat from the front to the back wall.

217
00:16:51,616 --> 00:16:54,578
And all I could visualize, which was distracting me,

218
00:16:55,318 --> 00:16:57,400
Where did everybody park to get to the theater?

219
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,782
So I guess if you build it, they will come.

220
00:17:00,002 --> 00:17:07,328
Well, if you create shows and programs, people will show up regardless of our parking situation.

221
00:17:08,369 --> 00:17:09,170
But we need support.

222
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,032
There was mention about funds.

223
00:17:12,853 --> 00:17:19,158
What I would like to do, and the committee and I were talking about it today, with the help of City Hall,

224
00:17:19,588 --> 00:17:22,329
but also about the citizens.

225
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:28,493
We'd like an idea of just, instead of getting the money, we have ideas of what we'd like to do, what that seed money would do.

226
00:17:29,013 --> 00:17:35,236
And if you remember, if you went to the theater the other night, if you walked into the lobby, it all needs a sprucing up.

227
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:45,222
From the time you walk up those front stairs to the time you get to your seats and everything else that the theater that we know needs, instead of just dumping money for shows, we'd like it to be what it's supposed to be.

228
00:17:45,242 --> 00:17:49,464
And if you've been reading the newspapers, a lot of the theaters in Boston are now closing.

229
00:17:50,547 --> 00:18:02,932
And one of the things I did recognize in the article is that all these directors, producers, actors, they're all finding that supply and demand is going to really hurt them in Boston, and they're going to have to find other places to go.

230
00:18:03,413 --> 00:18:09,195
And one of those places are going to be small communities like us that have a theater for them to put on their shows.

231
00:18:09,575 --> 00:18:14,337
Because if there's not enough theaters, they're going to have to wait out before they can actually put their performance on.

232
00:18:14,878 --> 00:18:20,480
So we are going to have a diamond in the rough as time goes on, because these theaters are going to be hard to find.

233
00:18:20,807 --> 00:18:27,330
The value in Boston for these theaters, where they're located, are more valuable as apartments, condominiums, and everything else that's going on.

234
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:29,711
So hopefully we can do that.

235
00:18:30,091 --> 00:18:41,756
Ken Krause had asked me if it was okay that I mention that the Method Arts Summit, there's gonna be a presentation by the Method Arts Council from one to four on November 14th at City Hall.

236
00:18:42,176 --> 00:18:47,218
And he believes it would be a good opportunity for people to come in and suggest ideas that they'd like to see at Chevalier.

237
00:18:47,858 --> 00:19:02,983
And one last thing, there is a vacancy still on our committee, Chevalier, if people are interested in being involved, the mayor appoints that person, and I believe also the friends of Chevalier also have a couple, maybe a vacancy or so with the friends.

238
00:19:03,304 --> 00:19:12,067
But it was a great night, not because of all the people that were there, but it was the awareness that Councilor Caviello brought up about what happened in Method Square.

239
00:19:12,367 --> 00:19:15,528
When I walked into Carol's and I went over to Sal's,

240
00:19:16,163 --> 00:19:18,504
Both of the managers there said the same thing to me.

241
00:19:19,385 --> 00:19:24,988
What a great night I had, and what an asset that theater is when everybody puts something together and shows up.

242
00:19:25,048 --> 00:19:28,129
So again, and thank you very much for your support last week.

243
00:19:33,432 --> 00:19:33,833
Good evening.

244
00:19:34,033 --> 00:19:35,754
Please state your name and address for the record.

245
00:19:36,014 --> 00:19:37,955
May Markeybrook, 16 Glenwood Ave.

246
00:19:41,517 --> 00:19:41,977
Good evening.

247
00:19:44,535 --> 00:19:53,442
And first I'd like to thank Councilor Carviello for once again giving us the opportunity to talk about the potential for the Chevalier Auditorium.

248
00:19:56,984 --> 00:20:07,852
I have been an advocate of the Chevalier Theatre for 25 years and founder of the Friends of Chevalier Auditorium and GMAC Gymnasium in 1993.

249
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:37,933
It's very, very gratifying now, at this moment in time, to see that there is more interest and support from the community and efforts to recognize the positive economic benefits that we can have from this wonderful theater.

250
00:20:39,934 --> 00:20:43,115
Chevalier is like the phoenix waiting to rise from the ashes.

251
00:20:45,365 --> 00:20:53,849
It can become a destination, a gathering place, and the engine to help build the creative economy in Medford.

252
00:20:55,910 --> 00:21:03,313
In a recent Gallup poll, the question was asked, what attaches people to their communities?

253
00:21:06,055 --> 00:21:12,778
In the three-year study, the researchers found that the key reasons cited by residents

254
00:21:14,032 --> 00:21:18,194
for loving their cities were entertainment and social offerings.

255
00:21:21,235 --> 00:21:25,938
How welcoming the city is and its arts, culture, and history.

256
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:41,365
Likewise, as reported by the National Endowment of the Arts and as an example of how having multiple cultural events can have a positive impact on the community,

257
00:21:43,003 --> 00:21:48,425
Let's say the theater has 1,000 people come to an 8 p.m.

258
00:21:49,265 --> 00:21:51,146
performance and leave at 10 o'clock.

259
00:21:52,687 --> 00:22:03,130
On the same day, the Medford Historical Society and Museum has 75 people attend an exhibit over the course of three hours.

260
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:12,514
And a rehearsal studio may have 40 or 50 people attending a program

261
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:16,192
and going on every hour during the day.

262
00:22:17,713 --> 00:22:26,039
All of this creates foot traffic, which we do not have at this point in time in Medford Square, at least very little.

263
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:38,687
People will go to dinner, buy newspapers and sundries, go shopping, hire babysitters, and use public transportation.

264
00:22:40,148 --> 00:22:41,269
These are not my words.

265
00:22:42,248 --> 00:22:51,076
but facts documented by major studies about how arts and culture play a critical role in the growth and revitalization of a community.

266
00:22:53,878 --> 00:23:08,791
A nationwide study by the Americans for the Arts showed that an attendee at an art event spends $24.60, not including the cost of admission.

267
00:23:10,662 --> 00:23:22,044
So, using these data, if 500 people attend an event at the Chevalier Theatre, this generates $12,300 in local business.

268
00:23:23,884 --> 00:23:26,765
For eight shows a month, it would be nearly $100,000.

269
00:23:28,805 --> 00:23:29,826
What are we waiting for?

270
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:36,747
As we look forward to changes at City Hall in 2016,

271
00:23:38,715 --> 00:23:51,383
We need active participation from the mayor's office and the city council for the revitalization of Medford Square and the incorporation of the Chevalier Theatre in a plan that makes an investment in arts and culture.

272
00:23:52,403 --> 00:24:01,849
I know many of you have spoken to that, and I look forward to your support.

273
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:06,092
The Chevalier Commission has done yeoman's work.

274
00:24:07,358 --> 00:24:14,584
and a lot of heavy lifting for 25 years with only minimum support from City Hall, and that needs to change.

275
00:24:17,306 --> 00:24:27,293
We can have the best and the most popular entertainers performing at Chevalier, but we need you, the residents who are listening to this meeting tonight.

276
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:35,720
I also call upon everyone in the city to support the Chevalier Theatre

277
00:24:36,657 --> 00:24:40,320
So your social and entertainment dollars will be spent here in Medford.

278
00:24:41,581 --> 00:24:52,690
This could begin by your attendance at upcoming shows such as the Bee Gees Tribute Band that will be at Chevalier on Saturday night, October 24th.

279
00:24:54,612 --> 00:25:00,677
And also the new onstage concerts scheduled for each month through May 2016.

280
00:25:02,807 --> 00:25:11,433
This is a very different, unique setting with the audience and the performers on stage.

281
00:25:12,214 --> 00:25:17,678
I attended the program just this past weekend, and it was absolutely delightful.

282
00:25:19,299 --> 00:25:32,569
During the ongoing election campaign, the male candidates and the city council candidates have said they are in favor of seeking and providing funds from the city for Chevalier.

283
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:36,300
Let's put these words into action and move forward.

284
00:25:37,861 --> 00:25:48,886
I would like to hand out to the council a little packet, which provides some of the information I've just talked about.

285
00:25:50,847 --> 00:25:55,689
And do we have enough time?

286
00:26:06,755 --> 00:26:23,228
Also, I should just mention this flyer that is circulating around the city showing many of the programs that are coming through the end of this year.

287
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:29,533
And there will be a lot more scheduled beginning in the first of the year.

288
00:26:29,873 --> 00:26:30,594
Thank you very much.

289
00:26:31,314 --> 00:26:31,815
Thank you, ma'am.

290
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,241
Thank you, Mr. President.

291
00:26:40,461 --> 00:26:41,821
Chair recognizes Councilor Camuso.

292
00:26:42,242 --> 00:26:43,442
Thank you very much.

293
00:26:44,063 --> 00:26:47,945
First of all, I want to thank Councilor Tarviello for putting this on the agenda this evening.

294
00:26:48,525 --> 00:26:57,910
You know, this last week's debate, there was something that we haven't seen, the enthusiasm in that room for both candidates, all Medford residents.

295
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:03,373
It was just something that we haven't seen in a long, long time in this community.

296
00:27:03,848 --> 00:27:14,676
You know, when I first got sworn in as a member of the Medford School Committee, that was the venue when Governor Salucci was out here and he swore all of us in, both school committee and city council and mayor.

297
00:27:15,297 --> 00:27:18,679
And, you know, it was just a wonderful place.

298
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:28,927
And I remember, you look at some of the old photographs from the swearing in in 2000, and you can see just in the photographs the upgrades that have taken place.

299
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:38,742
since the year 2000 or so at that very beautiful place that we call the Chevalier Theater in Medford Square.

300
00:27:39,302 --> 00:27:48,604
You know, as we left the debate and traversed Medford Square going to grab a bite to eat after, all the restaurants were packed.

301
00:27:49,024 --> 00:27:53,465
Carol's, Salvatore's, the overflow was down at Bocelli's and Razo's.

302
00:27:53,905 --> 00:27:55,165
It was just something that

303
00:27:56,332 --> 00:27:59,413
that the businesses can use.

304
00:28:00,094 --> 00:28:12,320
And think of the meals tax that was brought in just that evening by the influx of people that were out spending their money in the squares that not necessarily come out on a daily basis.

305
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:17,242
But I mean, I'm speechless.

306
00:28:17,922 --> 00:28:23,465
You've got to just really think about what that place can be, especially the colonial theater.

307
00:28:24,168 --> 00:28:26,110
is owned by Emerson College now.

308
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:28,673
They just took it offline for the next few years.

309
00:28:29,173 --> 00:28:33,137
They're not so sure where they're going to go with the theater.

310
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:37,582
The BU owns a theater that

311
00:28:39,069 --> 00:28:41,591
Not really sure what they're going to do with their theatre right now.

312
00:28:41,651 --> 00:28:47,155
And as the premier real estate agent in our community just said, the money's not in the theatres.

313
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:50,337
The money's in condominiums inside these theatres.

314
00:28:50,938 --> 00:28:54,801
And that's something certainly that we're not looking at here.

315
00:28:55,261 --> 00:29:06,689
But as that happens throughout New England and the greater Boston area, as the gentleman spoke earlier, there's going to be a need for theatres like ours that hold 1,200 people.

316
00:29:07,841 --> 00:29:22,251
And as I said, the investments that have been made there as a result of Representative Donato, who came through a few years ago and all the seats were done over, the acoustics, I believe, the organ was repaired, or is in the process of being repaired.

317
00:29:22,791 --> 00:29:24,332
It's a lot of good stuff.

318
00:29:24,412 --> 00:29:35,599
But the night of that mayoral debate, not only the dignity and the respect that was shown for the two candidates to one another on that stage, but the enthusiasm and the Medford pride that

319
00:29:37,022 --> 00:29:39,583
was exhumed through that whole area.

320
00:29:40,864 --> 00:29:44,845
The restaurants and everything else, it was something that I was actually very, very proud of.

321
00:29:45,246 --> 00:29:48,667
I went in there thinking we were just gonna see a debate and go home, but I saw a lot more.

322
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:55,470
I saw a lot of Medford people that are excited that there's an election, are excited to participate, watching that debate.

323
00:29:55,610 --> 00:30:02,073
And last but not least, the first I'm hearing about it this evening is about the debate not being played.

324
00:30:02,843 --> 00:30:07,407
They made it loud and clear that that was going to be on the public access channel, I thought.

325
00:30:07,928 --> 00:30:20,959
So if we can get an update from the mayor, because certainly I think it's very important that the debates be played just as the Tufts University events are being broadcast on the local access channels.

326
00:30:21,459 --> 00:30:25,022
So if we could get an update from the mayor's office on that particular piece.

327
00:30:25,403 --> 00:30:36,328
And also, if we could send out a thank you to the Somerville Community Access TV for coming in that evening and providing quality camera work and everything else.

328
00:30:36,348 --> 00:30:44,792
I know the sound from what I heard was a little bit off at the beginning, but they tweaked it throughout the debate, and it was just a great production.

329
00:30:45,312 --> 00:30:53,676
So I want to commend my colleague, Councillor Penta, for participating that evening, as well as our former colleague, Stephanie Burke,

330
00:30:54,238 --> 00:30:56,679
participating, because it takes two candidates to have a debate.

331
00:30:57,239 --> 00:31:05,962
And both of them stepped up, did something that's not that easy, and brought a lot of Medford pride to the Medford community last week.

332
00:31:06,002 --> 00:31:07,442
So thank you.

333
00:31:07,462 --> 00:31:13,044
So on the motion of Councillor Caviello, as amended by Councillor Caviello and Councillor Camuso.

334
00:31:13,764 --> 00:31:14,904
Citizen, you'd wish to speak?

335
00:31:15,645 --> 00:31:16,985
Yes, thank you, Mr. President.

336
00:31:17,025 --> 00:31:20,606
Bob Cappucci, 71 Evans Street, Medford, Mass.

337
00:31:21,486 --> 00:31:23,387
I would very much like to speak

338
00:31:24,243 --> 00:31:34,086
to the point of this DVD not being played on educational access and the government channel from the Chevalier Theater.

339
00:31:34,706 --> 00:31:41,049
I was certified in communications by the Massachusetts Department of Education back in 1996.

340
00:31:41,309 --> 00:31:45,470
Point of information, Councilor Camuso.

341
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:48,031
Who is saying that this event's not being played?

342
00:31:48,131 --> 00:31:56,016
I mean, they've been publicizing it that it's going to be getting replayed and replayed the beginning and Mr. Veneziano, the whole group, that was the intent from Jump Street.

343
00:31:56,056 --> 00:31:57,977
Otherwise they wouldn't have brought in scat and everything else.

344
00:31:58,658 --> 00:32:03,881
Does anyone know who's saying this from the city or do you have an answer Rob?

345
00:32:04,662 --> 00:32:05,882
Do you know where this is being said?

346
00:32:05,922 --> 00:32:08,404
Only that it was brought up as a rumor by

347
00:32:09,318 --> 00:32:11,379
Councilor Brianna Lungo-Pratt.

348
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,161
Well, we can't govern on rulings.

349
00:32:13,221 --> 00:32:24,547
Well, then I would just like to, whether it is or isn't, I just want to stand up here and advocate for it to be played on both channels.

350
00:32:24,928 --> 00:32:36,414
Because as a former grad student who taught debate at Pittsburgh State University in Kansas, this debate, I was there that night, this debate could be used as text

351
00:32:37,662 --> 00:32:39,703
I sat next to a young man, Alex.

352
00:32:40,183 --> 00:32:41,704
I was a senior at Medford High School.

353
00:32:41,884 --> 00:32:42,905
I forget his last name.

354
00:32:43,385 --> 00:32:50,088
The AP political class was there in attendance, and they got credit for being there.

355
00:32:50,668 --> 00:33:07,036
I hope that the powers that be, now that they have this DVD that has been given by the Chevalier to the city, which is owned by the people, get to play that on both of our only two access channels, which is the government and the educational

356
00:33:07,455 --> 00:33:07,795
access.

357
00:33:08,155 --> 00:33:21,139
And one final point, sir, to the people watching at home, I hope that your voice is loud, that this is played as soon as possible until Election Day on both access channels that Medford does have.

358
00:33:21,379 --> 00:33:22,339
Thank you, Mr. President.

359
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:23,580
That was part of the resolution.

360
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:24,700
Good evening.

361
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,021
Please state your name and address for the record.

362
00:33:27,361 --> 00:33:28,621
My name is Michael Ruggiero.

363
00:33:28,821 --> 00:33:30,142
I live on 18 Pembroke Street.

364
00:33:30,242 --> 00:33:32,222
I just want to make a quick update.

365
00:33:32,442 --> 00:33:34,543
The people at Chevalier Theatre have been nice enough to

366
00:33:34,977 --> 00:33:39,380
they're going to drop off some DVDs of the complete debate at the library for people to check out.

367
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:43,922
Then until everything is available online, I think that'll provide a nice option for people.

368
00:33:44,122 --> 00:33:44,402
Thank you.

369
00:33:44,903 --> 00:33:45,323
Thank you.

370
00:33:46,784 --> 00:33:47,184
Good evening.

371
00:33:47,584 --> 00:33:51,126
Anthony Antonio 12, Yale street.

372
00:33:51,346 --> 00:33:56,009
Um, I know there was a rumor going around and it came from the high school by way of the city hall.

373
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:58,871
Yeah, but let's, let's look at it this way.

374
00:33:58,891 --> 00:34:01,332
A real, let's just look at it this way.

375
00:34:01,853 --> 00:34:04,434
In 48 hours, if that's not being played,

376
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:05,330
There's a problem.

377
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:14,436
So that rumor will become true because it only takes 48 hours for the tape to go from here to a Thursday night replay and a Friday night replay.

378
00:34:15,196 --> 00:34:16,637
Rumors are that it's all being edited.

379
00:34:16,697 --> 00:34:20,759
I don't think there's any need to edit, but if it's not allowed, it's not shown anywhere in the city.

380
00:34:22,196 --> 00:34:23,637
Point of information, Councilor Knight.

381
00:34:23,797 --> 00:34:26,720
I think we're really moving away from the substance of this resolution.

382
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:34,406
You know, the resolution that Councilor Caviello filed was to discuss the positive effects that the Chevalier Auditorium has on our economic business district down in Method Square.

383
00:34:34,446 --> 00:34:36,628
And now it's turning into whether or not the debate's being played.

384
00:34:36,648 --> 00:34:38,649
I think it's becoming overly politicized.

385
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:39,610
You know what I mean?

386
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:42,733
We're here to show our support for the Chevalier Auditorium.

387
00:34:43,213 --> 00:34:49,298
And, you know, while the resolution is coming out of the fact that we had a debate there, it was very well attended, it was recorded.

388
00:34:49,996 --> 00:34:55,661
I think that the intent of the resolution, and the councilor can correct me if I'm wrong, was to highlight the fact that the debate was a big success.

389
00:34:55,721 --> 00:34:59,664
It brought a lot of different people to our downtown business district and was a catalyst for economic growth.

390
00:35:00,505 --> 00:35:04,468
I don't think it really has anything to do with whether or not the debate's going to be played on channel three or not.

391
00:35:04,528 --> 00:35:14,777
I think the purpose and the substance of the resolution, Mr. President, is really about the effects of economic revitalization, the effects of vibrant downtowns that the arts community and that the Chevalier Auditorium can have on Medford.

392
00:35:15,097 --> 00:35:18,340
And I'd like to see us stay a little bit more focused on that and a little bit less focused on

393
00:35:18,693 --> 00:35:21,534
what direction we're going in terms of whether or not the debate's going to be played.

394
00:35:22,014 --> 00:35:22,714
You know what I mean?

395
00:35:22,774 --> 00:35:23,335
Is it important?

396
00:35:23,355 --> 00:35:23,995
Yeah, it's important.

397
00:35:24,015 --> 00:35:27,536
I think that that could be taken up maybe later on in the meeting during the public participation portion.

398
00:35:27,576 --> 00:35:29,157
I share an agreement with you, Counselor.

399
00:35:29,757 --> 00:35:34,859
And part of the amendment to the resolution was to ask for a clarification on this important matter.

400
00:35:35,059 --> 00:35:35,279
Great.

401
00:35:35,319 --> 00:35:36,659
Well, the subject was brought up.

402
00:35:37,399 --> 00:35:38,320
I wanted to talk on it.

403
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:38,960
I understand that.

404
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:39,400
Great speech.

405
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,401
But it's happened before.

406
00:35:41,801 --> 00:35:43,101
I want to see that video.

407
00:35:43,121 --> 00:35:43,642
Thank you.

408
00:35:43,722 --> 00:35:44,942
And I want to see Chevalier get funded.

409
00:35:46,463 --> 00:35:46,823
Thank you.

410
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:49,761
Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

411
00:35:50,501 --> 00:35:51,782
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

412
00:35:51,902 --> 00:35:58,566
And again, I'd like to thank the folks down at the Chevallier Auditorium, the Commission, and the Friends of for putting on such a wonderful event.

413
00:35:59,026 --> 00:35:59,927
The place was immaculate.

414
00:35:59,947 --> 00:36:01,047
You could eat off the floor in there.

415
00:36:01,067 --> 00:36:01,648
It looked great.

416
00:36:02,508 --> 00:36:14,075
I think it's imperative that this council, Mr. President, amends this resolution to request that the administration take a look at putting seed money and to develop a master plan, Mr. President, a master plan to look at

417
00:36:14,766 --> 00:36:18,572
what direction the Chevalier Auditorium is going to go, the Chevalier Theatre is going to go in.

418
00:36:18,973 --> 00:36:28,148
And the master plan, you know, will take time to put together, but I think if we can act on this now and get some seed money now to start developing a master plan, then we can make this a priority for the FY17 budget.

419
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:34,862
And then we might be able to get a nice line item in there, Mr. President, to start taking care of some of the capital needs that are necessary down there.

420
00:36:35,102 --> 00:36:46,946
So I'd move to amend the paper, Mr. President, by requesting that we take a look at developing a master plan to govern Shivire Auditorium's future direction, what direction they're going to go in to do a capital needs assessment, and move forward in that regard.

421
00:36:47,346 --> 00:36:53,868
So on the motion of Councilor Caviello, as amended by Councilors Caviello, Camuso, and now Councilor Knight.

422
00:36:55,088 --> 00:36:56,589
Chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

423
00:36:58,718 --> 00:36:59,959
Thank you, Mr. President.

424
00:37:00,319 --> 00:37:03,300
And I just want to thank Councilor Caviello for bringing this up.

425
00:37:03,681 --> 00:37:05,341
You know, this is not a new issue.

426
00:37:06,202 --> 00:37:17,067
This issue of the lack of funding that the city has taken a backseat for many, many years on providing seed money, if you want to call it seed money.

427
00:37:18,448 --> 00:37:21,249
And we have to remember, this is a city building.

428
00:37:22,109 --> 00:37:23,590
This is not a private building.

429
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:25,851
This is a city-owned building that

430
00:37:26,722 --> 00:37:52,642
has been neglected for many years, and thanks to the Friends of Chevalier and the Chevalier Commission that have done Yeoman's work over many, many years, and with all open transparency, I am a member of the board of the Friends of Chevalier, and I can speak firsthand about the countless hours that no one sees behind the scenes of how these performances get put together.

431
00:37:53,003 --> 00:37:54,664
And it's not because the city's pushing,

432
00:37:55,083 --> 00:38:08,193
or if the city's providing seed money, it's the volunteers that are putting this all together and spending countless hours, as May just mentioned and Susan just mentioned, about the performances.

433
00:38:08,513 --> 00:38:21,222
This weekend will be the BJs, BJs, the BGs, and I can just tell you wholeheartedly that that type of performance should bring out a group of 800, 900 people.

434
00:38:21,843 --> 00:38:24,665
And I would hope that we anticipate that because

435
00:38:25,642 --> 00:38:32,646
I think that suits well to the age group, not only in this community, but surrounding communities that grew up with that type of music.

436
00:38:33,106 --> 00:38:54,796
But I just want to mention, Mr. President, that until this city gets serious about its public facilities, and, you know, it was only just recently within the last couple of years that the city finally acknowledged that the arts were part of the community and put a line item in the budget to support those, a minimal line item,

437
00:38:55,163 --> 00:38:58,585
but it showed in good faith that the city's behind the arts.

438
00:38:59,065 --> 00:39:11,871
And there's no reason why, and the master plan is probably already in the workings with the commission, I'm sure, but there's no reason why there shouldn't be a line item in the budget to support performances.

439
00:39:13,132 --> 00:39:18,155
Also, an issue that's been around for a number of years is there's no air conditioning in the building.

440
00:39:18,595 --> 00:39:24,518
So you can take out three, four, five months out of the year that it's very difficult to bring in acts

441
00:39:24,981 --> 00:39:26,162
when there's not air conditioning.

442
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:28,783
And that's a major concern.

443
00:39:29,323 --> 00:39:36,086
I know there's been discussion about the facade and other aspects of the building that need to be looked at.

444
00:39:36,947 --> 00:39:53,995
But really, until the city steps up to the plate, and after three master plans for the revitalization of Meffitt Square that mentioned Chevalier as an economic engine for the revitalization of Meffitt Square, three master plans

445
00:39:54,428 --> 00:39:58,773
You would think someone in the Office of Community Development would have read it and said, wait a minute.

446
00:39:59,573 --> 00:40:00,815
What a gem we have here.

447
00:40:00,855 --> 00:40:01,315
Look at this.

448
00:40:01,756 --> 00:40:02,577
It's standing right here.

449
00:40:02,617 --> 00:40:10,325
We have a building that potentially could bring in thousands of people a week into our community and provide foot traffic throughout the community.

450
00:40:11,246 --> 00:40:14,229
And nothing has been done by this administration for years.

451
00:40:15,065 --> 00:40:15,926
Nothing has been done.

452
00:40:16,646 --> 00:40:20,629
And, you know, we could talk about other areas, but Lowell did it right.

453
00:40:21,089 --> 00:40:23,351
Lowell provides seed money for their auditorium.

454
00:40:24,231 --> 00:40:28,314
They bring in a lot of top-notch performances.

455
00:40:29,035 --> 00:40:33,538
And as I think it was Councilor Penta that mentioned it, it takes money to make money.

456
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:41,684
So if you don't want to invest into Chevalier, we're going to be stuck with the need to have improvements done to the building.

457
00:40:41,744 --> 00:40:43,385
And I'm sure there's reasons why

458
00:40:43,757 --> 00:40:47,219
Performers don't want to come here based on some of the things that we lack.

459
00:40:47,859 --> 00:40:53,802
And so this is the wish list I think we need to sit down with the commission and the friends and say, what do we need?

460
00:40:53,822 --> 00:41:01,125
You know, if we're going to have a chart the course and a capital improvement plan, it should include Chevalier.

461
00:41:01,525 --> 00:41:02,986
And we should be able to look at it and say,

462
00:41:03,773 --> 00:41:08,617
for $150,000 or $200,000 or whatever it might be, the figure, this is what we'll need.

463
00:41:09,137 --> 00:41:13,040
And based on this, we believe we can bring in these many more performances.

464
00:41:13,401 --> 00:41:16,763
Based on this, we believe that it could be used for other purposes.

465
00:41:16,783 --> 00:41:24,109
And, you know, it was talked about, I think, John Veneziano and some people talked about movie night there a while back.

466
00:41:24,629 --> 00:41:31,755
And I think that's a terrific idea for kids that are 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 years old that really have nowhere to go in this community.

467
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:40,824
after 7, 8 o'clock, and would love to see a movie in their own town, to go in there and see a movie on a giant screen in an old-fashioned theater.

468
00:41:41,204 --> 00:41:48,627
And as was mentioned, that night, I had several people come up to me and say, this is the first time I've ever been in this building, and I've been here my whole life.

469
00:41:49,227 --> 00:41:50,267
Not that they didn't know about it.

470
00:41:50,528 --> 00:41:52,628
It's just the first time they've been in the building.

471
00:41:53,249 --> 00:41:59,551
And I think that speaks volumes to where this city has Chevalier on a priority list.

472
00:42:00,051 --> 00:42:01,232
And I'm hoping that changes.

473
00:42:01,702 --> 00:42:03,343
come January of next year.

474
00:42:03,984 --> 00:42:08,667
And I'm hoping that this city wakes up and realizes that we have a gem in this community.

475
00:42:09,247 --> 00:42:14,491
And we really do need to step up to the plate, Mr. President, and put our money where our mouth is.

476
00:42:15,152 --> 00:42:24,238
And, you know, we don't need three reiterations of an economic revitalization plan to tell us that this is a true gem in our community.

477
00:42:24,678 --> 00:42:26,740
We should all realize that, and I think we do.

478
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,662
I just want to thank Mr. President, if I could,

479
00:42:30,069 --> 00:42:34,291
because the Friends just passed out a pamphlet.

480
00:42:34,891 --> 00:42:41,174
And I just want to mention the co-presidents, Cindy Watson and Mike Cerullo, they do a great job.

481
00:42:41,735 --> 00:42:46,097
The treasurer, Kenneth Krauss, watches every penny that's going through the Friends.

482
00:42:46,517 --> 00:42:49,999
And then you have board members, May Makibrek, who was one of the founding members.

483
00:42:50,339 --> 00:42:56,902
Representative Donato, Susan Fairchild, who's been a very active and involved member and now part of the Chevalier Commission.

484
00:42:57,262 --> 00:42:58,963
Russ Rossetti, who's been on the Chevalier

485
00:42:59,536 --> 00:43:01,517
a number of years, and Keith Barry.

486
00:43:02,178 --> 00:43:09,603
And they do a tremendous job in trying to solicit funds and keep that building up to where it should be, Mr. President.

487
00:43:09,623 --> 00:43:09,983
The President.

488
00:43:10,323 --> 00:43:10,884
Absolutely.

489
00:43:11,284 --> 00:43:12,124
Thank you, Counselor.

490
00:43:12,185 --> 00:43:13,045
Counselor Caravello.

491
00:43:13,185 --> 00:43:13,926
Thank you, Mr. President.

492
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:15,847
I'll just be brief, and I'll finish up on this.

493
00:43:15,867 --> 00:43:24,393
But, you know, we have a subcommittee on arts and culture, which I think President Camuso started last year.

494
00:43:24,493 --> 00:43:27,575
And I think Brianna, Counselor Longo, I think is the chairman of that.

495
00:43:28,108 --> 00:43:32,611
Why don't we have a committee meeting with the Friends and all the Chevalier people?

496
00:43:33,072 --> 00:43:37,915
And also, maybe it's time we go out and maybe look for some private funding.

497
00:43:38,336 --> 00:43:46,502
Also, maybe like some of the other theaters do, they have like a bank or a corporation sponsor series of things.

498
00:43:47,442 --> 00:43:52,246
Let's see, maybe if we all sit around the room and brainstorm, something will get done.

499
00:43:52,266 --> 00:43:57,810
I mean, it was my group, the Kiwanis, if you saw a few weeks ago when Facebook was running around,

500
00:43:58,410 --> 00:44:00,750
We did a show there with Lou Rawls.

501
00:44:01,791 --> 00:44:07,232
And right after the show, we had a private party that sold 400 tickets.

502
00:44:07,532 --> 00:44:12,292
May was there, and Mr. Rawls was kind enough to stay till 3 in the morning with everybody.

503
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:16,773
And again, you'll see, this isn't a new idea of bringing people in.

504
00:44:17,713 --> 00:44:24,055
So I would ask Councilor Longo-Kearns if she could call a meeting of the subcommittee and get the friends and everybody together.

505
00:44:24,095 --> 00:44:26,355
Maybe we could all brainstorm for the next few weeks.

506
00:44:27,961 --> 00:44:30,323
And everybody can get on the same track here.

507
00:44:30,783 --> 00:44:34,266
So on the main motion, further amended by Councilor Caviello.

508
00:44:34,666 --> 00:44:36,128
Chair recognizes Councilor Penta.

509
00:44:37,349 --> 00:44:44,574
Some years ago, excuse me, so many years ago, Shaviro Auditorium could have possibly been non-existent here in the city of Medford.

510
00:44:44,754 --> 00:44:45,535
You may remember this.

511
00:44:45,635 --> 00:44:50,539
When they were cutting up the old Medford High School, Shaviro Auditorium was part of the original package.

512
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:54,042
And it was at the behest of the then Medford City Council

513
00:44:54,398 --> 00:44:58,881
that the separation took place, because if it didn't take place, we wouldn't even be talking about this today.

514
00:44:59,461 --> 00:45:00,122
That's number one.

515
00:45:00,402 --> 00:45:15,992
This is the second time, I would say, in the last six months, I think it was Councilor Caviello who brought up the resolution some six months ago or thereabouts, when there was a private film developer here in Medford Square, and they were putting up a marquee on top of the Chevalier Theater, and that drew so much attention.

516
00:45:16,052 --> 00:45:19,254
People thought that they were getting a marquee and shows were going to be coming to town.

517
00:45:19,274 --> 00:45:23,857
It was a great idea, and unfortunately, it didn't go anywhere because it wasn't

518
00:45:24,962 --> 00:45:27,724
It wasn't the auditorium's idea to put the marquee up.

519
00:45:27,784 --> 00:45:30,366
It was the private entrepreneur from Hollywood to do it.

520
00:45:30,807 --> 00:45:35,110
But it's a showing that if you had something like that, people would know what's coming.

521
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:38,372
Now, as far as the great debate goes, it was well advertised.

522
00:45:38,412 --> 00:45:40,774
The chamber should be very proud of what they did.

523
00:45:40,894 --> 00:45:41,794
I am very proud of it.

524
00:45:42,295 --> 00:45:48,239
And more importantly, I just think it goes to show that if you bring something into that theater, people will come.

525
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:51,321
Now, once you got into the theater, I think you saw something different.

526
00:45:51,381 --> 00:45:53,563
I think what you saw was a very old building

527
00:45:54,203 --> 00:46:00,604
that probably needs some rehabilitation, but you don't want to take the character away from the building that's contained inside of it.

528
00:46:01,124 --> 00:46:04,885
I believe they did a great job in the lobby and the bathrooms coming in, and that took some money.

529
00:46:05,365 --> 00:46:06,626
Again, all volunteer work.

530
00:46:06,666 --> 00:46:12,347
It's been all volunteer work since the separation took place from Old Mifflin High School and Cheviot became independent.

531
00:46:12,947 --> 00:46:23,769
The unfortunate part about it, I just don't think it's ever been looked upon by city government the same way it's looked at now it is today, because you know it's a viable asset here for this community.

532
00:46:24,247 --> 00:46:25,588
It can make money for the theater.

533
00:46:25,668 --> 00:46:29,109
It can also definitely make money here for the folks here in Medford.

534
00:46:30,350 --> 00:46:34,272
The part about it, I think it was Councilor Marks alluded to the fact that it's not air-conditioned.

535
00:46:34,372 --> 00:46:37,614
And as you know, when you go to the Boston theaters, they are air-conditioned.

536
00:46:37,814 --> 00:46:44,657
And in the heat of the summer, you're just not going to get the type of a show that you think you would like to get because you're not Boston, number one.

537
00:46:44,677 --> 00:46:45,818
The drawer is not the same.

538
00:46:46,228 --> 00:46:49,750
The amenities around the theater probably are not the same.

539
00:46:50,311 --> 00:46:56,455
But this theater is one of the catalysts that's going to make this square come back and come alive.

540
00:46:56,755 --> 00:47:02,059
This is what the new administration is going to want to deal with, because it's going to be good for the city of Medford.

541
00:47:02,299 --> 00:47:08,263
And it's going to show that arts, culture, and history can be incorporated into your everyday commercial life.

542
00:47:08,604 --> 00:47:10,685
It can be incorporated into your business district.

543
00:47:10,885 --> 00:47:13,567
And it definitely can be communicated and worked into

544
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:17,603
your everyday nightlife that the City of Medford is working on very slowly.

545
00:47:18,884 --> 00:47:24,409
It was quite obvious that on that particular night, we had folks there from Somerville SCAT TV.

546
00:47:24,429 --> 00:47:31,815
And the only problem that I would probably say that presented itself that night, that should have been the City of Medford's cable access telecasting that.

547
00:47:32,356 --> 00:47:37,560
We're going on the 21st year of the third year of a 10-year contract with Comcast.

548
00:47:38,072 --> 00:47:53,575
And because we're going on this third year, and because we just renewed, the city, excuse me, the city just renewed its contract, I believe it was May 7th, the public hearing took place, and I was the only one here for the city because I believe that Shavia, as well as other parts of this city, should have been included into the contract.

549
00:47:53,975 --> 00:47:59,436
And if Shavia was wired properly, we wouldn't be talking about this for the next 10 years.

550
00:47:59,876 --> 00:48:07,418
So I think what the commission's gonna have to deal with, and it's gonna be a very tough deal, is no matter what they wanna produce there, and what they wanna show, and how they wanna get it out,

551
00:48:07,957 --> 00:48:13,020
It's going to be costly, and they're going to have to go out of town because, again, Comcast is not there.

552
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,041
Maybe we can do something about that.

553
00:48:15,321 --> 00:48:19,143
Maybe we can revisit that whole issue of how we're getting it rewired for whatever it might be.

554
00:48:19,343 --> 00:48:21,284
But right now, it doesn't stand that way.

555
00:48:21,724 --> 00:48:34,750
And when you have folks there from the high school, which was Channel 15, and you had the government channel being there, the people were excited over the fact that not only did you have almost 1,000 people there, but people would be able to watch this live.

556
00:48:34,771 --> 00:48:37,732
They'd be able to see it subsequent to that on a later date.

557
00:48:38,499 --> 00:48:46,882
I can't say nothing more other than the fact that I believe it was a good night for everybody there, the contestants, the panelists, the folks that put the program together.

558
00:48:47,502 --> 00:48:59,245
It did exactly what it was supposed to do, make the people, let them know, A, there's an election, but more importantly, let them know that Chevalier Auditorium is a viable component here in the city of Medford.

559
00:48:59,825 --> 00:49:04,387
So rather than letting, have all these volunteers do the work, it's time that the city steps up to the plate.

560
00:49:05,107 --> 00:49:05,827
The city of Lynn,

561
00:49:06,392 --> 00:49:09,073
proposes our office, I could be wrong, John, you can correct me.

562
00:49:09,093 --> 00:49:14,095
I think it's about $100,000 they started off their auditorium commission over there.

563
00:49:14,475 --> 00:49:16,096
They gave them the money to do a show.

564
00:49:16,476 --> 00:49:20,558
You go do the show, give us the money back, we'll give you the money for the next show.

565
00:49:20,618 --> 00:49:23,639
And slowly but surely, it was one of these little walking steps.

566
00:49:23,699 --> 00:49:25,100
Not running steps, walking steps.

567
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:26,880
And that's what they did to get it going.

568
00:49:27,261 --> 00:49:28,161
We can do the same thing.

569
00:49:28,201 --> 00:49:29,141
You can go to Stoneham.

570
00:49:29,501 --> 00:49:31,142
Look what they did to an old movie theater over there.

571
00:49:31,342 --> 00:49:32,023
It came alive.

572
00:49:32,643 --> 00:49:35,644
Small as it might be, it's alive, it's well, and it's running.

573
00:49:36,233 --> 00:49:41,074
Medford has the talent, they have the arts, they have the history, and they definitely have the culture to do this in.

574
00:49:41,614 --> 00:49:53,956
So with that being said, Councilor Caviallo, but more importantly, to you, the citizens of this community, and to the Chevalier Auditorium Commission, and everyone who put that together that night, I think it was a great night for the city of Medford, and I thank you, and I'm very appreciative of it.

575
00:49:54,196 --> 00:49:54,476
Thank you.

576
00:50:00,477 --> 00:50:00,817
Thank you.

577
00:50:00,897 --> 00:50:03,918
I just want to agree with my council colleagues.

578
00:50:05,009 --> 00:50:12,653
With regards to a master plan, I think that's something that needs to be started immediately in January with the new administration and the new council.

579
00:50:13,513 --> 00:50:21,137
Hopefully being able to work together to discuss a master plan, capital improvement plan on one side and a master plan.

580
00:50:21,157 --> 00:50:26,399
And I believe the master plan does have to include Medford Square, Chevalier, and the library.

581
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:33,823
I think it's time that we invest and really take pride in the two buildings we have and revamp our square and

582
00:50:34,270 --> 00:50:40,332
and actually get something done with regards to the three master plans of Medford Square that have already been paid for.

583
00:50:41,893 --> 00:50:47,414
With that being said, I would ask the Chevalier Commission if you could forward us your wish list.

584
00:50:47,455 --> 00:50:49,555
You did mention there's a wish list.

585
00:50:49,595 --> 00:50:51,176
If the council could see your wish list.

586
00:50:51,676 --> 00:51:03,460
And also, if there's any research that you've done with regards to Lynn or Lowell revenue that's brought in from the theater, money that's input and output, so the city council couldn't be apprised

587
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:23,951
Before we sit down and meet on this, whether it be in committee meeting or, you know, with the new administration, hopefully in January, I think it would be good to see the numbers, to see what Lynn and Lowell are paying out and what they're bringing in, to review their mails tax, their hotels tax, and see what, you know, investment we're able to put into it.

588
00:51:24,371 --> 00:51:32,956
Obviously, the budget's going to need to be reworked if we want to put some, I think it should be, you know, a good amount of seed money and some capital improvements to the Chevalier.

589
00:51:33,568 --> 00:51:40,090
So that's something that needs to be round-tabled and discussed, and I definitely look for, you know, hope that I'll be able to help with that.

590
00:51:40,770 --> 00:51:41,210
Very good.

591
00:51:41,950 --> 00:51:43,250
Chair recognizes Councillor Nye.

592
00:51:43,470 --> 00:52:01,715
I just want to clarify, Mr. President, because there was some discussion about when I said master plan and when I amended the paper for a master plan, I meant the master plan for the operations of Shavire Auditorium, not a master plan for Medford Square and the library or anything else, just a master plan for Shavire Auditorium, so we can see what direction the auditorium is going to go in, and I think that we can do that with the work of the people that have been doing

593
00:52:02,590 --> 00:52:04,691
keeping this place going for so long as it is right now.

594
00:52:05,091 --> 00:52:07,953
So, you know, I certainly look forward to a subcommittee meeting on this.

595
00:52:08,013 --> 00:52:13,796
I'll be in attendance even though I'm not a member, Mr. President, as soon as it's called because I think this is very important and I think we need to move on it.

596
00:52:13,816 --> 00:52:15,798
I don't think we need to wait until 2017.

597
00:52:16,078 --> 00:52:23,222
If we can give some seed money now to figure out exactly what it is to develop a master plan and we can start working right now on what the needs are and assessing the needs, then we can

598
00:52:23,808 --> 00:52:37,895
fund a master plan, then we can have the engineers come in and take a look at it and figure out what it's going to cost us to actually make a long-term investment into Chevalier Auditorium so that Chevalier Auditorium's up and running, and that there's a commitment from City Hall that's going to continue to fund it, and they're going to be able to generate revenues.

599
00:52:37,935 --> 00:52:52,643
I think they've done a great, great job using creative ways to generate revenue that's not on the backs of the taxpayers, and it may be through renting, through organizations and groups that some people don't agree with, but, you know, I think that they've done a great job, and they've done what they have to do to keep the place alive and keep it where it is, Mr. President.

600
00:52:52,979 --> 00:52:55,041
So with that being said, I see no need to wait.

601
00:52:55,061 --> 00:52:56,662
I don't think we need to wait for a new administration.

602
00:52:56,702 --> 00:52:58,064
I don't think we need to wait till January.

603
00:52:58,084 --> 00:52:59,045
I think we can start right now.

604
00:53:00,386 --> 00:53:00,626
Thank you.

605
00:53:00,666 --> 00:53:13,178
So on the motion for approval by Councilor Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Camuso, amended by Councilors Caraviello, Camuso, and Knight.

606
00:53:14,299 --> 00:53:16,541
Chair recognizes Councilor Camuso.

607
00:53:17,502 --> 00:53:18,823
Just waiting to take the vote, that's all.

608
00:53:22,369 --> 00:53:23,109
Your amendment is?

609
00:53:23,129 --> 00:53:36,978
I'd like to get the wish list from the Cervalho Commission, as well as any research that the commission has done with regards to other theaters, input, output, revenues brought in, so that we can make an informed decision.

610
00:53:37,018 --> 00:53:40,260
As further amended by Councilor, Vice President Lungo Kern.

611
00:53:41,361 --> 00:53:47,305
And also that we get an update with regards to whether or not the video is going to be played of the debate on Wednesday.

612
00:53:47,325 --> 00:53:48,766
That was already amended by Councilor Camuso.

613
00:53:48,906 --> 00:53:49,226
Thank you.

614
00:53:50,387 --> 00:53:51,708
On that motion, all those in favor?

615
00:53:53,053 --> 00:53:53,753
All those opposed?

616
00:53:54,754 --> 00:53:55,074
Carries.

617
00:53:55,134 --> 00:53:55,834
Congratulations.

618
00:53:56,274 --> 00:53:57,615
Thank you all for your hard work.

619
00:54:02,977 --> 00:54:07,238
Petitions, presentations, and similar matters, 15-710.

620
00:54:07,799 --> 00:54:15,922
Petition by Eversource Energy to update the council and public on the Mystic Woobin transmission project.

621
00:54:18,563 --> 00:54:18,963
Welcome.

622
00:54:19,543 --> 00:54:20,343
Thank you, Mr. President.

623
00:54:20,363 --> 00:54:22,304
Please share with us your name and address for the record.

624
00:54:23,341 --> 00:54:25,982
We appreciate the opportunity to come in again and speak with you.

625
00:54:27,883 --> 00:54:29,103
My name is Bill Zamparelli.

626
00:54:29,143 --> 00:54:31,404
I'm the Community Relations Representative with Eversource.

627
00:54:31,904 --> 00:54:34,065
And I want to introduce our project team.

628
00:54:34,825 --> 00:54:36,946
Mark Kimball is our Outreach Coordinator.

629
00:54:37,986 --> 00:54:42,208
David Velez is the Project Manager for this particular project.

630
00:54:42,668 --> 00:54:47,049
And Jack Lopes is my colleague from Community Relations.

631
00:54:48,970 --> 00:54:52,311
I did prepare a, or we did prepare a presentation

632
00:54:52,945 --> 00:54:55,387
All the counselors have been given a copy of this by the messenger.

633
00:54:55,407 --> 00:54:58,169
A series of copies up here, if anybody in the audience would like one.

634
00:54:58,569 --> 00:54:59,950
I don't know how many are left.

635
00:54:59,970 --> 00:55:01,691
There's three or four over here.

636
00:55:01,731 --> 00:55:07,995
We didn't know that there weren't video capabilities here.

637
00:55:08,656 --> 00:55:10,957
So what I'd like to do is just walk through this.

638
00:55:10,977 --> 00:55:14,460
This is really an update on the last presentation that we made.

639
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:17,982
I think that was about a month and a half ago that we were in to see you.

640
00:55:21,982 --> 00:55:24,563
The Mystic to Woobin Line project, Medford City Council.

641
00:55:26,645 --> 00:55:44,594
What we're going to talk about tonight is the Mystic to Woobin Line project overview, the overall project schedule, proposed route within Medford, the Medford next steps, proactive municipal and community outreach throughout, project duration, and the contact information.

642
00:55:46,235 --> 00:55:51,118
Just to refresh everyone's memory, we have proposed a

643
00:55:52,645 --> 00:56:02,647
115 KV transmission line that would run from Mystic Station in Everett to the Woburn Station 211 in the city of Woburn.

644
00:56:03,627 --> 00:56:08,368
This is an important electric reliability project that we'll be putting.

645
00:56:08,568 --> 00:56:15,850
It's a regional project that will benefit virtually all of Massachusetts and southern Massachusetts.

646
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:21,931
This, along with about 40 other ISO New England projects,

647
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:35,347
will account for about $800 million annually in reduced energy costs to the residents in Massachusetts and southern New Hampshire.

648
00:56:37,288 --> 00:56:46,673
That is really an opportunity for ISO New England to call up the least cost generators.

649
00:56:47,113 --> 00:56:52,116
Currently, their interconnectivity between stations limits what

650
00:56:52,621 --> 00:56:53,901
generation they can bring up.

651
00:56:55,002 --> 00:57:02,543
As a result, more costly energy is required than would be necessary if these projects were in place.

652
00:57:07,605 --> 00:57:15,967
The Medford-Woburn Line project has proposed a new underground transmission line that will connect the existing Mystic station to the Everett station.

653
00:57:16,827 --> 00:57:22,228
The new line will extend approximately eight miles between two existing substations passing through Everett, Boston.

654
00:57:22,982 --> 00:57:25,603
Somerville, Medford, Winchester, and Woburn.

655
00:57:26,323 --> 00:57:34,147
Proposed project includes improvements within the existing fence line and the Mystic-Woburn substations.

656
00:57:36,447 --> 00:57:37,748
Overall project schedule.

657
00:57:39,089 --> 00:57:51,854
We have had a series of open houses that we held in a number of communities, including Woburn, Winchester, Somerville, and on May 11th, we held an open house in Medford.

658
00:57:53,682 --> 00:58:00,005
We have filed on May 20th with the Massachusetts Energy Facility Siting Board.

659
00:58:00,665 --> 00:58:08,409
And for this project, there was an Energy Facility Siting Board public hearing held July 15th, 2015.

660
00:58:10,990 --> 00:58:19,954
We had contacted all of those who testified at the hearing to follow up with them to make sure that we had addressed any of their concerns.

661
00:58:21,714 --> 00:58:23,035
There's an evidentiary hearing.

662
00:58:23,419 --> 00:58:26,600
that will take place in later December or possibly January 2016.

663
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:32,142
There's a decision anticipated around the fourth quarter of 2016.

664
00:58:32,802 --> 00:58:37,343
That'll be the approval of the project.

665
00:58:38,143 --> 00:58:44,005
We were looking at starting construction pending the EFSB approval in the first quarter of 2017.

666
00:58:44,045 --> 00:58:49,367
And the estimated project in-service date is 2018.

667
00:58:49,647 --> 00:58:53,028
There's a map that's included

668
00:58:54,115 --> 00:58:57,556
that shows the preferred route and a alternate route.

669
00:58:58,617 --> 00:59:02,298
Uh, we are focused on the preferred route.

670
00:59:06,059 --> 00:59:06,299
Sure.

671
00:59:06,519 --> 00:59:10,000
Bill on that page, you want page number two, page number two.

672
00:59:10,741 --> 00:59:12,681
That's where your preferred route and your alternate routes are.

673
00:59:14,422 --> 00:59:14,602
Yes.

674
00:59:15,342 --> 00:59:20,804
The goal routes, which align themselves to be the alternative route, which look like they're way out of,

675
00:59:21,627 --> 00:59:22,488
the general direction.

676
00:59:22,888 --> 00:59:23,548
Why is that?

677
00:59:23,988 --> 00:59:26,730
Why would you not be able to do the preferred route?

678
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:32,113
Well, we are required to submit two routes to the EFSB.

679
00:59:32,673 --> 00:59:35,415
They require us to have two constructible routes.

680
00:59:36,075 --> 00:59:47,281
And while we clearly feel that the preferred route that we've identified is the best route, we do have to have a buildable second route that they may consider.

681
00:59:48,782 --> 00:59:50,163
It's my understanding that the

682
00:59:50,717 --> 00:59:56,862
Energy Facility Siting Board has not selected an alternate route in the past.

683
00:59:57,183 --> 01:00:01,446
Now, that doesn't mean they wouldn't in the future, but that's not been the case to date.

684
01:00:01,846 --> 01:00:07,932
But if you were to choose that alternate route for whatever the reason might be, it looks like the way it is here would be much more costly.

685
01:00:08,492 --> 01:00:08,953
It would be.

686
01:00:09,193 --> 01:00:15,278
And part of this is our route that we've selected is much shorter than the alternate route.

687
01:00:15,868 --> 01:00:21,993
And distance and cost are some of the major factors that the EFSB considers.

688
01:00:22,013 --> 01:00:31,060
But we are required to have the second route to submit that with the filing.

689
01:00:38,806 --> 01:00:39,687
MedFed Next Steps.

690
01:00:41,128 --> 01:00:43,310
Project Engineering will work with the Department of Public

691
01:00:43,825 --> 01:00:48,708
works in the city engineers to review the project design proposed route throughout the city.

692
01:00:49,488 --> 01:01:04,396
We are at approximately 50% engineering on the preferred route, and we are working with the Department of Public Works and the city engineer currently to review the route that we've selected.

693
01:01:05,937 --> 01:01:10,679
Preliminary line alignment has been completed and is available for review.

694
01:01:12,344 --> 01:01:17,727
Traffic management plans will be developed, working closely with the city engineer and city officials.

695
01:01:18,827 --> 01:01:27,312
The project will petition the city for grants of location in the public rights way, similar to other public utility projects.

696
01:01:28,592 --> 01:01:35,135
And the project and city will negotiate an agreement and project construction timing and community benefits.

697
01:01:36,296 --> 01:01:38,717
We are in discussions with the mayor on just those.

698
01:01:42,070 --> 01:01:44,612
Point of further information, Councillor Pinto.

699
01:01:44,793 --> 01:01:48,636
On that last point, on the project and the city will negotiate an agreement, you have mitigation in there?

700
01:01:48,736 --> 01:01:49,757
Is there going to be mitigation?

701
01:01:49,777 --> 01:01:51,758
There will be mitigation with this project.

702
01:01:51,798 --> 01:02:03,488
We are working with the mayor right now and he has requested if there's any specific mitigation that the city council had interest in, that they should direct that to his office.

703
01:02:04,549 --> 01:02:07,471
Before the city council can direct it, how do we know where to go?

704
01:02:07,491 --> 01:02:09,713
In other words, what would the mitigation be and for what?

705
01:02:12,105 --> 01:02:32,697
I, I, we, we negotiate a host community agreement with the, with the city and we had been in discussions with the, with the, the mayor, um, since August, probably to review potential opportunities that, that this, that the city would, would pursue mitigation for the project.

706
01:02:33,197 --> 01:02:37,820
Now, normally these are things that would be tied directly to the project where we would

707
01:02:38,181 --> 01:02:43,243
we would look to make improvements in the areas that we come in contact with.

708
01:02:43,263 --> 01:02:45,724
Thank you.

709
01:02:46,444 --> 01:02:47,225
Thank you, Councilor.

710
01:02:51,826 --> 01:02:53,427
Bill is going to continue.

711
01:02:53,527 --> 01:02:54,307
Go ahead.

712
01:02:54,588 --> 01:02:54,688
OK.

713
01:02:55,288 --> 01:03:01,050
I think we talked about the proactive municipal and community outreach throughout the project.

714
01:03:01,350 --> 01:03:03,031
We have made a significant effort

715
01:03:06,798 --> 01:03:17,703
We hold public hearings in open houses and we have had a series of contacts with the general public in all six communities that are affected here.

716
01:03:18,444 --> 01:03:26,628
We have held the, all of the open houses were regional open houses that were made available to any resident in any of those communities.

717
01:03:27,308 --> 01:03:33,752
There were people that, you know, from one community might not have had the opportunity because they had a conflict the night it was held in their community.

718
01:03:34,112 --> 01:03:36,353
But we have widely advertised these

719
01:03:37,118 --> 01:03:51,445
And there were, uh, mailings and invitations sent to, uh, to, uh, butters along these routes, I guess we wanted to open it up for questions.

720
01:03:51,525 --> 01:03:53,886
If you had specific questions, sure.

721
01:03:53,926 --> 01:03:57,227
The number of the question, uh, councilors been waiting in queue.

722
01:03:57,247 --> 01:03:58,828
Oh, we're going to start with council.

723
01:03:58,848 --> 01:03:59,148
Can you move?

724
01:03:59,188 --> 01:04:01,269
So thank you.

725
01:04:01,509 --> 01:04:04,031
And, uh, appreciate you being here again, Mr. Zamparelli.

726
01:04:04,591 --> 01:04:04,691
Um,

727
01:04:05,307 --> 01:04:13,931
I don't have any specific questions at this point, but you guys are being very, very proactive, being here a couple times, holding the other community meetings.

728
01:04:15,592 --> 01:04:22,556
I'm very impressed, to be honest with you, because sometimes we get the calls after the fact to clean up.

729
01:04:23,216 --> 01:04:25,177
And you guys are being very proactive.

730
01:04:25,777 --> 01:04:30,940
And based upon that, I know that if I do get any questions, I'll be calling you at your office for specific residents.

731
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:34,142
But thank you for being upfront, open, and

732
01:04:35,567 --> 01:04:36,687
Very accessible so far.

733
01:04:36,747 --> 01:04:37,567
We appreciate that.

734
01:04:37,627 --> 01:04:39,988
We do make an effort to try to communicate.

735
01:04:40,848 --> 01:04:46,889
And if anyone has questions or concerns, we have a website in Eversource.com.

736
01:04:46,929 --> 01:04:50,250
There's a web page that would list this particular project.

737
01:04:52,590 --> 01:04:58,392
And if there's any questions, our contact information is on the last page here.

738
01:04:58,992 --> 01:05:00,892
And that's up on the Eversource website?

739
01:05:01,292 --> 01:05:03,373
That would be on the Eversource website also.

740
01:05:03,413 --> 01:05:03,593
Perfect.

741
01:05:04,373 --> 01:05:05,093
Thank you very much.

742
01:05:06,012 --> 01:05:06,212
Good.

743
01:05:06,552 --> 01:05:08,174
Chair recognizes Councilor Caviello.

744
01:05:08,374 --> 01:05:08,994
Thank you, Mr. President.

745
01:05:09,495 --> 01:05:12,117
Mr. Senator, I don't doubt the validity of your project.

746
01:05:12,857 --> 01:05:19,602
My only concern is the neighbors of the Rotary, over by Wynton Street, in that area.

747
01:05:20,423 --> 01:05:23,966
I mean, these people have just endured two and a half years of construction.

748
01:05:25,227 --> 01:05:31,211
And they're going to have maybe a year off, and then you're going to start construction again over there.

749
01:05:31,352 --> 01:05:32,953
The road has just been all repaved.

750
01:05:32,973 --> 01:05:33,934
The circle's been repaved.

751
01:05:34,394 --> 01:05:35,595
Now we're going to dig it all up again.

752
01:05:37,167 --> 01:05:48,252
And those are the people that are going to suffer the most, is all those neighbors who say two and a half years of digging and everything, and now we're going to start all over again.

753
01:05:50,252 --> 01:05:58,656
We have had some discussions with the mayor on this, and he has raised some issues about improving that area, and that was one of the issues that has been

754
01:05:59,503 --> 01:06:03,064
put forth as a mitigation effort to try to address some of that.

755
01:06:03,204 --> 01:06:04,164
What type of improvements?

756
01:06:04,685 --> 01:06:09,246
Well, one of the questions that came to us was addressing the rotary itself.

757
01:06:09,746 --> 01:06:16,988
Apparently that rotary has not worked very well because there's some question about how people use it.

758
01:06:17,609 --> 01:06:21,750
So we'll basically be going right through the rotary.

759
01:06:22,190 --> 01:06:24,911
So what we would do is look to try to address that.

760
01:06:26,211 --> 01:06:28,472
But again, I would think a suggestion maybe

761
01:06:29,171 --> 01:06:38,373
have a neighborhood meeting with, especially with that neighborhood, like I said, they've been devastated for two and a half years of construction and they're going to get dug up all over again.

762
01:06:38,393 --> 01:06:45,114
Now, are you going to pay from curb to curb when you dig up, or are you just going to just patch what you do?

763
01:06:45,234 --> 01:06:49,055
That would be part of the discussions that we'd have with the mayor also.

764
01:06:49,755 --> 01:06:52,056
I don't think that should even be a discussion.

765
01:06:52,336 --> 01:06:54,136
The road's brand new and we're going to dig it up.

766
01:06:54,176 --> 01:06:57,577
If it's a brand new road, we would leave anything that we touch in

767
01:06:58,176 --> 01:06:59,316
as good or better condition.

768
01:07:00,097 --> 01:07:05,198
I mean, I, I wouldn't, I wouldn't support anything that didn't have a curb to curb paving for those people.

769
01:07:05,218 --> 01:07:14,720
So again, I say, you know, if you, if you can get together with the neighbors over there, there's, I'm sure there's a room at the, at the condo there, uh, and you know, talk with them.

770
01:07:14,740 --> 01:07:17,281
Would be happy to meet with anybody.

771
01:07:17,641 --> 01:07:19,162
Because they're going to feel the biggest brunt of it.

772
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:22,262
And like I said, they've been going through it for two and a half years.

773
01:07:22,282 --> 01:07:24,123
So if you could do something with them, I'd appreciate it.

774
01:07:24,483 --> 01:07:24,683
Okay.

775
01:07:25,048 --> 01:07:28,489
If you have a contact person over there, I'd be happy to follow up with them.

776
01:07:28,529 --> 01:07:30,569
Councilor Knight, he lives in the building.

777
01:07:32,589 --> 01:07:33,930
Should I contact Councilor Knight?

778
01:07:33,950 --> 01:07:35,450
Councilor Knight can call a meeting in the building.

779
01:07:36,070 --> 01:07:37,850
And the chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

780
01:07:38,170 --> 01:07:39,470
Mr. President, thank you very much.

781
01:07:39,511 --> 01:07:47,872
I think that, um, one of the items, Mr. President, I'd like to add to the committee report to send to the mayor in terms of mitigation would be, um, to have a traffic study done relative to the timing of the lights.

782
01:07:48,712 --> 01:07:53,953
Um, because when construction projects come into the city, um, what happens is there's traffic flows disrupted.

783
01:07:54,402 --> 01:07:58,704
And when traffic flow is disrupted, the light timing doesn't necessarily line up with what's going on.

784
01:07:59,004 --> 01:08:03,046
And I think we have a problem right now with the timing of our lights anyway, so I think this project will be twofold.

785
01:08:03,226 --> 01:08:11,709
If we can get some mitigation to address some of the light timing along the stretch of the preferred route, I think that might be very helpful in the long term as well as in the short term.

786
01:08:12,670 --> 01:08:17,972
Second, and as I look at this preferred route, and we see where we cross over the Mystic River?

787
01:08:19,232 --> 01:08:20,473
Can you tell me exactly where that is?

788
01:08:21,509 --> 01:08:35,336
It would come across, we'd be coming down South Street and then we would do what they call a horizontal directional drill under the river and we would come up in the DCL land near where the community gardens is.

789
01:08:36,056 --> 01:08:49,963
Now we've been in contact with the people from the community gardens and we've worked out an agreement basically to whatever we touch we will restore throughout that process.

790
01:08:51,502 --> 01:08:56,045
so you can actually go under the river.

791
01:08:56,185 --> 01:09:01,108
It will be a horizontal directional drill under the river and come up on the other side.

792
01:09:02,369 --> 01:09:09,634
Mr. Zimbra, would you be willing to also meet with the Mystic River Watershed Association to discuss this project as well as to what's going on?

793
01:09:11,775 --> 01:09:20,441
We understand that people don't like surprises and we want to make sure that everybody gets a full understanding of what we're doing and if they have concerns we want to hear about them.

794
01:09:20,912 --> 01:09:21,532
Excellent, excellent.

795
01:09:21,592 --> 01:09:27,795
I mean, one of the things that impresses me the most here, Mr. President, is that we get this and they're ready to send it to everybody in the city.

796
01:09:27,815 --> 01:09:31,136
And it's who to call, when to call, where to call, if you have any questions, concerns.

797
01:09:31,196 --> 01:09:33,337
And I've called and they've been very responsive to me.

798
01:09:33,838 --> 01:09:37,979
And I have a lot of faith that they'll be very responsive to the members of the general public.

799
01:09:38,820 --> 01:09:46,183
However, in the committee report, Mr. President, I would like to reflect that we'd like to see a traffic engineer address the light timing issues.

800
01:09:46,740 --> 01:09:56,994
And I'd also like to see in the committee report that we have them meet with the Mystic River Watershed Association to determine if there's going to be any environmental impact of their master plan, which just got funded through the state legislature last term.

801
01:09:57,615 --> 01:10:01,901
And when I was looking at the map, I was a little confused because I thought it was going to bring us right down to

802
01:10:02,872 --> 01:10:13,101
You're coming down South Street from Mystic, from the police station down South Street, and we have a large construction project going on right now, the renovations of the Craddock Bridge.

803
01:10:13,121 --> 01:10:17,524
So I think the mitigation of traffic in that area is going to be very important, Mr. President.

804
01:10:17,584 --> 01:10:21,568
I think it's going to be vital, actually, to the quality of life of the residents that are along the roadway.

805
01:10:21,588 --> 01:10:29,214
And we will coordinate with that project so that we have the ability to stage this in different

806
01:10:29,835 --> 01:10:32,297
time frame so we can work with them to try to avoid.

807
01:10:32,317 --> 01:10:41,605
When I excuse myself and Garmin notes, actually I did take a look at that and I saw some of the commitments that were made before that it could be phased and it could be done in certain sections and segments and so forth.

808
01:10:41,685 --> 01:10:47,230
And one of the other things that I'm also looking at is the fact that it seems as though you're pretty much on schedule at this point in time.

809
01:10:47,290 --> 01:10:52,595
Nothing's changed from the last time you had all the time that you to the, to when you appear before us now in terms of timeline.

810
01:10:52,956 --> 01:11:01,859
which is very good because, you know, as Councilor Caviello said, certain individuals that live along this stretch have been subjected to extensive periods of time of construction.

811
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:07,020
And I'd like to see, you know, that as we move, we move according to schedule.

812
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:07,881
I know it has to get done.

813
01:11:07,901 --> 01:11:08,941
It's something that needs to happen.

814
01:11:09,881 --> 01:11:13,122
And, you know, I can certainly appreciate the fact that you're here.

815
01:11:13,142 --> 01:11:17,223
I can certainly appreciate the fact that you're offering an olive branch to mitigate the circumstances.

816
01:11:17,844 --> 01:11:22,485
You know, I think that this is the way that we should be doing projects and I really commend you and your office and your team

817
01:11:22,889 --> 01:11:26,632
for coming here this evening, once again, to further update us on the situation.

818
01:11:26,652 --> 01:11:28,313
So thank you very much, Mr. Zamparelli.

819
01:11:28,713 --> 01:11:31,255
And Mr. President, I just ask that the report reflect such.

820
01:11:32,316 --> 01:11:33,156
The clerk has that.

821
01:11:33,316 --> 01:11:35,458
So motion moved by Councilor Knight.

822
01:11:36,339 --> 01:11:37,780
Chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

823
01:11:39,241 --> 01:11:40,241
Thank you, Mr. President.

824
01:11:40,582 --> 01:11:49,648
And first, I'd like to thank the city administration for sending out, at the request of this council, a reverse 911 to notify residents

825
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:55,321
of Eversource's presence here tonight to explain the project.

826
01:11:55,841 --> 01:12:01,282
Although the reverse 911 went out today, it was still notification.

827
01:12:01,302 --> 01:12:04,243
So I just want to thank the administration for sending that out.

828
01:12:05,003 --> 01:12:09,704
At the last meeting, I believe it was back in May, that you were before the council.

829
01:12:09,784 --> 01:12:09,964
Yes.

830
01:12:11,405 --> 01:12:16,186
There were several questions asked that I don't believe we've received responses to.

831
01:12:17,918 --> 01:12:19,300
Which questions are those?

832
01:12:19,420 --> 01:12:20,903
There was probably a dozen.

833
01:12:21,904 --> 01:12:25,069
Maybe the city clerk can get the papers from that meeting.

834
01:12:25,530 --> 01:12:26,511
They weren't responded to.

835
01:12:26,671 --> 01:12:31,859
Some of it was because of the fact that I guess much of the design has not been done.

836
01:12:32,923 --> 01:12:35,044
We are at 50% engineering at this point.

837
01:12:35,484 --> 01:12:39,146
We were at 25 to 50, I believe it was at that time.

838
01:12:39,186 --> 01:12:39,946
Was that correct?

839
01:12:40,467 --> 01:12:40,707
Right.

840
01:12:40,787 --> 01:12:48,731
So it becomes a much clearer route and much clearer answers as we proceed with the engineering.

841
01:12:49,331 --> 01:12:51,452
And so we're now at a 50% stage.

842
01:12:51,772 --> 01:12:59,836
We will be working with the DPW and the city engineer to further clarify any issues in the design.

843
01:13:00,216 --> 01:13:01,937
So the question I posed back in May

844
01:13:02,407 --> 01:13:09,469
was the fact that this project is roughly 3.2 miles through our portion of the city.

845
01:13:10,529 --> 01:13:20,411
And along that 3.2 miles, there'll be an eight inch steel pipe, 24 inch wide by 60 inch deep trench.

846
01:13:21,471 --> 01:13:23,392
The full length of this 3.2 miles.

847
01:13:24,712 --> 01:13:29,053
And the concern I raised at the time is approximately 17 manholes

848
01:13:31,025 --> 01:13:33,326
uh, will be neat to install.

849
01:13:33,666 --> 01:13:37,507
And that's for the whole entire project or just within the city of method.

850
01:13:37,727 --> 01:13:39,968
I believe that's, that's the whole project, right?

851
01:13:40,348 --> 01:13:41,308
It is the whole project.

852
01:13:41,428 --> 01:13:44,849
So at the time I asked how many manholes will be installed within the city.

853
01:13:45,429 --> 01:13:54,872
It's my understanding that at least 10 by 10, uh, and, um, and they're going to be anywhere from 2000 to 2400 linear square feet apart.

854
01:13:54,892 --> 01:13:55,032
And, um,

855
01:14:00,677 --> 01:14:04,480
Do we have an idea where these 10 by 10 manholes are going to be located?

856
01:14:04,681 --> 01:14:07,903
I think that's what we're going to be working with the city on as we speak.

857
01:14:08,924 --> 01:14:17,212
We've had an initial meeting with the city engineer to review the existing design that we have, and we will try to further that as we continue.

858
01:14:17,892 --> 01:14:20,314
So you do know where currently you plan on putting them?

859
01:14:20,835 --> 01:14:23,517
I think we have ideas of where they are.

860
01:14:25,037 --> 01:14:25,257
Okay.

861
01:14:25,898 --> 01:14:26,098
Yes.

862
01:14:26,278 --> 01:14:27,558
The answer, I guess, is yes.

863
01:14:27,658 --> 01:14:37,023
Because, in my opinion, the 3.2 miles of the 24 inch by 60 inch deep is going to be a huge inconvenience.

864
01:14:37,063 --> 01:14:51,431
But these manholes are going to be a giant inconvenience on our roads, on roads that, if you go through in the morning, you'll realize just even trying to get your kid up to Meffitt High School in the morning is a task in itself.

865
01:14:52,212 --> 01:14:54,733
And I think I asked at the time,

866
01:14:55,610 --> 01:15:02,391
It was going to be along the curbing, I believe the gentleman said, with the underground trench that was going to be dug.

867
01:15:02,431 --> 01:15:03,632
It was going to be close to the curb.

868
01:15:04,572 --> 01:15:05,152
Is that correct?

869
01:15:05,652 --> 01:15:08,312
You might have better answers on some of this.

870
01:15:08,372 --> 01:15:08,492
Hi.

871
01:15:08,532 --> 01:15:10,513
If you could just say your name and address for the record.

872
01:15:11,053 --> 01:15:11,333
Sure.

873
01:15:11,373 --> 01:15:14,874
David Velez, project manager with Eversource on this project.

874
01:15:15,534 --> 01:15:16,734
I live in Arlington, Mass.

875
01:15:17,574 --> 01:15:21,955
And to address the mantle thing issue specifically,

876
01:15:22,402 --> 01:15:26,184
We do have our 50% design, which does have the proposed alignment.

877
01:15:26,204 --> 01:15:40,333
So we now have a set of plans delivered to the city engineer's office that shows exactly where in the streets we propose, at this point, the trench to go, as well as where the proposed manholes are.

878
01:15:40,553 --> 01:15:45,996
Those are, as you mentioned, generally every 2 to 2,400 feet apart.

879
01:15:46,056 --> 01:15:49,458
That is a function of you have to join the cables together

880
01:15:50,036 --> 01:15:50,796
at certain parts.

881
01:15:51,097 --> 01:15:57,000
The cables can only be so long before you have to join them, and that's the function the manholes provide.

882
01:15:57,880 --> 01:16:03,363
But there is some flexibility in that we don't necessarily have to do them at the furthest extent.

883
01:16:04,543 --> 01:16:13,508
If the math put that right smack in the middle of a big intersection, we can shift it, maybe make that distance smaller to reduce, you know, the impact of where that manhole would be.

884
01:16:13,918 --> 01:16:24,981
And that's the purpose of giving these plans to the various municipalities and their engineering departments so that they can look and have more knowledge maybe than we do to say, you know, this particular location might be a problem.

885
01:16:25,042 --> 01:16:26,402
This intersection has a lot of traffic.

886
01:16:26,442 --> 01:16:29,323
Could you consider shifting things slightly?

887
01:16:29,523 --> 01:16:31,404
And that's something we would look at.

888
01:16:32,364 --> 01:16:39,246
So based on what you have to design right now, where will the eight inch pipe steel pipe be located?

889
01:16:40,050 --> 01:16:45,918
It varies, it does, it's not, I can't tell you it's just along the curb for the entire length of Medford.

890
01:16:47,380 --> 01:16:55,472
In some areas it is along the curb, in some areas it has to cross over other utilities, has to get to the other side of the street where it gets to the curb.

891
01:16:56,011 --> 01:17:03,893
In some areas, I'm thinking particularly on Main Street and 38, in the commercial area, there's a large center island and it's right in the center.

892
01:17:05,473 --> 01:17:11,315
So it does move as it progresses through the route.

893
01:17:11,435 --> 01:17:14,295
It's based on what's built in the street now.

894
01:17:14,335 --> 01:17:21,977
We would work to try to avoid existing things and find a slot that works for everyone.

895
01:17:22,390 --> 01:17:27,353
So a typical trench, would that be located in the middle of the street or towards the curb?

896
01:17:28,714 --> 01:17:31,796
Again, it varies based on the location.

897
01:17:32,176 --> 01:17:37,419
So from what you're telling me in a 3.2 mile stretch, uh, we, we could have an obstacle course.

898
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:43,083
Uh, our streets could turn into an obstacle course because you have piping that goes across the street.

899
01:17:43,383 --> 01:17:45,945
You might have a trench that's located on the other side of the street.

900
01:17:46,565 --> 01:17:47,646
It doesn't seem to be,

901
01:17:49,088 --> 01:17:49,808
It's systematic.

902
01:17:50,849 --> 01:17:55,170
I think it's important to realize that, you know, we wouldn't open the whole trench up at once.

903
01:17:55,510 --> 01:18:01,673
What we will do is we'll work down the street with a construction team that would actually do excavation.

904
01:18:02,153 --> 01:18:06,355
They would probably saw cut the street, and then they would excavate.

905
01:18:06,655 --> 01:18:15,638
They would install that pipe, and it might be 100 to 150 feet long, and they'd just move down the street, they'd backfill the trench, and they'd have a temporary patch behind it.

906
01:18:15,898 --> 01:18:16,058
Right.

907
01:18:16,318 --> 01:18:18,239
I'm talking about the trench itself.

908
01:18:18,675 --> 01:18:19,515
That's what I'm talking about.

909
01:18:19,776 --> 01:18:19,976
Right.

910
01:18:20,056 --> 01:18:25,478
So if you have a trench that's 10 by 10, and what's the average street width on Winthrop Street?

911
01:18:25,498 --> 01:18:33,482
The trench would actually probably be five feet wide, and it'd probably run two feet wide by five feet deep.

912
01:18:33,942 --> 01:18:34,302
No, no.

913
01:18:34,422 --> 01:18:35,563
I'm talking about the manholes.

914
01:18:35,743 --> 01:18:36,383
The manholes.

915
01:18:36,523 --> 01:18:37,004
The manholes.

916
01:18:37,404 --> 01:18:38,964
They're actually not square.

917
01:18:38,984 --> 01:18:40,045
They're roughly 12 by 24.

918
01:18:40,085 --> 01:18:41,245
They're larger.

919
01:18:41,586 --> 01:18:44,207
These are transmission manholes as opposed to distribution manholes.

920
01:18:44,247 --> 01:18:44,747
The 12 by 24?

921
01:18:44,807 --> 01:18:45,027
Yes.

922
01:18:45,307 --> 01:18:45,908
They are larger.

923
01:18:46,508 --> 01:18:46,648
Right.

924
01:18:47,170 --> 01:18:55,435
So if you were gonna put that in the middle of the street, you're talking probably, no matter how quickly you work and how efficiently you work, lots of detours.

925
01:18:56,535 --> 01:19:01,038
Detours or, again, moving the traffic, taking the lane, shifting.

926
01:19:02,198 --> 01:19:07,061
What's the average width of just say Winthrop Street down towards the Winchester line?

927
01:19:08,802 --> 01:19:10,703
I don't have that dimension off the top of my head.

928
01:19:11,203 --> 01:19:12,144
You don't know what the average is?

929
01:19:12,164 --> 01:19:12,564
Is it 20 feet wide?

930
01:19:12,584 --> 01:19:12,724
Is it 25?

931
01:19:16,255 --> 01:19:23,497
My recollection is it's probably about, you know, somewhere between 20 and 30 feet on each direction, going either way.

932
01:19:24,177 --> 01:19:32,839
Because I think there's a lane for parking and then there's an active lane going, if it's west or north, I'm not sure.

933
01:19:33,319 --> 01:19:39,660
And then on the other direction, there'll be a lane and there'll be active lane for parking also.

934
01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:41,420
Right.

935
01:19:41,460 --> 01:19:43,981
You know, I just think at some point, I realize you're only 50% there.

936
01:19:45,390 --> 01:19:59,973
But at some point, we really need to see some type of, and I know the project's slated for 2017, but I really, and the reason why we called for this meeting, I know members have been thanking Eversource for coming up, but we actually requested that you come up here.

937
01:20:00,453 --> 01:20:01,233
We're happy to do it.

938
01:20:01,273 --> 01:20:11,034
Right, and provide a presentation, and I'm happy you came up, and honestly, I've been very pleased with the outreach and the documentation we've received.

939
01:20:11,454 --> 01:20:14,315
But I think at some point, as a member of the council,

940
01:20:14,725 --> 01:20:16,767
because I'm receiving the phone calls and emails.

941
01:20:17,607 --> 01:20:26,454
Uh, you know, people would like to know what's going to happen and you know, they're curious about the project, but they want to know what's going to happen in front of the house and you can't blame them.

942
01:20:27,294 --> 01:20:36,321
And that's why I'm trying to get more specifics so we can tell people, uh, you know, on this stretch, you may have a manhole on this stretch.

943
01:20:36,341 --> 01:20:40,204
You're not going to have a manhole, but you're going to have just the trench or, you know,

944
01:20:40,874 --> 01:20:44,935
So when do you think we'll be able to see that prior to the construction?

945
01:20:45,435 --> 01:20:47,616
Well, I think that's the reason why we had the open houses.

946
01:20:47,656 --> 01:20:56,298
We actually had had demonstrations of what that would look like, what a typical trench in the excavation process would look like at that May 11th open house.

947
01:20:57,079 --> 01:21:07,361
And we had three other regional open houses, but the, but in terms of giving them specificity in terms of right in front of their house, I guess we'd have to have this engineered.

948
01:21:07,481 --> 01:21:09,782
And I think that's part of this process working with,

949
01:21:10,690 --> 01:21:18,312
The DPW, the city engineer, to try to move this to 100% engineering is what we're looking for.

950
01:21:18,852 --> 01:21:24,173
And to get to that point, it's probably going to be running parallel with the approval process.

951
01:21:24,673 --> 01:21:27,934
If I may, there's two parts to what I believe you're asking for.

952
01:21:28,054 --> 01:21:32,635
One is the engineering, the alignment plan itself, the plan view of that.

953
01:21:33,273 --> 01:21:39,135
is now complete, and again, that's been delivered to the City Engineering Office for review.

954
01:21:40,035 --> 01:21:47,697
At this point, while it's a public document, I would not support putting that out on a website for everyone to see, because it will change over the next several months.

955
01:21:47,977 --> 01:21:49,797
It is a work in progress, to be certain.

956
01:21:50,278 --> 01:21:54,359
But the point you're asking about is how are we going to manage the traffic, how are we going to manage the construction?

957
01:21:55,651 --> 01:21:57,432
Will it mean a detour or will it mean a lane shift?

958
01:21:57,952 --> 01:22:04,314
All of that is worked on in the traffic management plan process, which is our next step.

959
01:22:05,795 --> 01:22:08,555
In the grand scheme of things, we just completed the alignment.

960
01:22:08,595 --> 01:22:11,997
That step is, you know, the ink is still wet on the page.

961
01:22:12,437 --> 01:22:18,579
We now move to the traffic management plan part where we give that alignment plan to the traffic engineer.

962
01:22:19,043 --> 01:22:27,830
They start doing these staging plans to start identifying, here are some key intersections, here are some high volume traffic routes, here are bus routes, et cetera.

963
01:22:28,031 --> 01:22:28,991
They put that all together.

964
01:22:29,011 --> 01:22:32,695
Then they reach out to various municipalities, engineering agencies.

965
01:22:32,715 --> 01:22:33,916
They reach out to MassDOT.

966
01:22:34,236 --> 01:22:40,681
They pull this together, and that's when they come up with proposals and say, OK, for the manhole here, we would suggest

967
01:22:41,522 --> 01:22:48,707
implementing a lane shift, and then we would take that out and discuss it with the various areas that are impacted.

968
01:22:48,727 --> 01:22:50,769
So that effort is starting now.

969
01:22:50,969 --> 01:22:56,193
We are bringing on board the traffic engineering firm that we think we're going to use.

970
01:22:56,593 --> 01:23:06,020
I think the work in earnest for that will start in the beginning of next year, and by the first quarter, certainly by the middle of next year, we're going to be far along on that.

971
01:23:07,436 --> 01:23:15,039
I also should say that we will be seeking grants of location in the public way for the, for the pipeline and the manholes.

972
01:23:15,119 --> 01:23:19,821
And so there will be an approval process that the city of Medford will have over that process.

973
01:23:20,321 --> 01:23:21,761
Right now.

974
01:23:21,781 --> 01:23:34,566
Uh, I read online that the Winchester project, which is about a third smaller than our project in terms of length, uh, was expected to take place within a six month construction period.

975
01:23:35,808 --> 01:23:38,950
Is that going to be comparable on our side?

976
01:23:38,990 --> 01:23:42,272
Can we take the six months and say, well, we're a third larger?

977
01:23:43,133 --> 01:23:45,694
It's going to be roughly, you know, eight months?

978
01:23:49,059 --> 01:23:54,741
I think what we'll find is that we're not required to start at one end and go to the other end.

979
01:23:55,021 --> 01:23:58,902
We'll probably have construction going in the different communities.

980
01:23:59,943 --> 01:24:10,106
I think the point is that we know we're going to make 100 to 150 feet a day, and we'll work our way through that process as it continues.

981
01:24:10,186 --> 01:24:12,147
Now, there'll be more than one crew working this.

982
01:24:12,247 --> 01:24:15,668
It's not going to be just one crew that's going to be constructing this.

983
01:24:16,708 --> 01:24:18,449
multiple crews in different locations.

984
01:24:19,089 --> 01:24:20,489
And we'll try to work with the city.

985
01:24:20,929 --> 01:24:29,132
You know, we expect, you know, we'll have all the traffic management plans and the police details and whatever is required to ensure the public safety.

986
01:24:29,152 --> 01:24:29,612
Right.

987
01:24:29,972 --> 01:24:34,833
But the, the length of the project is anticipated two years altogether, right?

988
01:24:34,873 --> 01:24:36,294
Is that 17, 18?

989
01:24:36,374 --> 01:24:38,054
Is that the ballpark?

990
01:24:38,074 --> 01:24:41,495
Entirety of the project, including substation work, the entirety of the project.

991
01:24:42,068 --> 01:24:50,431
So is it safe to say, because of how you're going to do the work, that it's possible that our roads will be under some sort of construction for two years?

992
01:24:51,151 --> 01:24:51,771
I wouldn't say that.

993
01:24:52,892 --> 01:24:54,392
Well, what can you give us?

994
01:24:55,312 --> 01:25:00,154
You know, I realize on your end, you're going to try to do it the most efficient and probably cost-effective way.

995
01:25:00,614 --> 01:25:04,175
And on our end, I want to see you come in and get out of our city, to be quite honest with you.

996
01:25:05,176 --> 01:25:11,778
And, you know, so it's not advantageous for us or the residents or our traffic, so it's cost-effective for you.

997
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:13,160
to be here for two years.

998
01:25:13,721 --> 01:25:15,781
So I wanna see you do your work and get out.

999
01:25:16,561 --> 01:25:17,382
Just so you know that.

1000
01:25:17,402 --> 01:25:19,062
We share that desire.

1001
01:25:19,502 --> 01:25:29,606
You may or may not, but the city of Cambridge right now is putting a moratorium on any openings of their streets for non-emergent purposes.

1002
01:25:30,266 --> 01:25:41,890
And I'm not sure what this project would be classified as, but it begs to be looked at because as Councilor Caviello mentioned, our roads have been dug up so many times

1003
01:25:42,660 --> 01:25:46,122
Not just for underground utilities, but for other reasons.

1004
01:25:46,162 --> 01:25:50,245
We have mains from the MWRA that run and feed other communities.

1005
01:25:50,705 --> 01:25:53,067
And we're constantly under construction in this community.

1006
01:25:53,407 --> 01:25:58,950
And the Winthrop Circle, as Councilor Caviello mentioned, has really borne the brunt for the last several years.

1007
01:25:59,551 --> 01:26:08,336
So, you know, I realize the overall project is to help with, you know, electricity for communities that are further out.

1008
01:26:09,663 --> 01:26:23,674
It's not just further out, it's the entire state of Massachusetts and southern New Hampshire will benefit from this, and it will be a significant improvement from electric reliability and the cost of generation.

1009
01:26:24,354 --> 01:26:27,857
And just the last point, Mr. President, I'd like to make, and again, I thank Eversource.

1010
01:26:27,877 --> 01:26:35,382
You know, the project slated for 2017, 2018, we're trying to get a handle, and I can appreciate the fact.

1011
01:26:36,403 --> 01:26:38,845
I do have an issue with the mayor,

1012
01:26:39,258 --> 01:26:47,980
negotiating mitigation, a mayor that's going to be leaving in a couple of months, and the project doesn't start until 2017.

1013
01:26:48,460 --> 01:26:57,561
And the next mayor come this January might have very different ideas on mitigation and what they may want to do to Winthrop Street and some of the areas that are impacted.

1014
01:26:58,241 --> 01:27:08,183
And, you know, I'm not quite sure why the mitigation, although I think it's warranted, has to be discussed with this current mayor at this particular point.

1015
01:27:08,933 --> 01:27:22,779
And, you know, I'm not sure how other councilors feel, but I truly think this should be an issue that is confronted with the next mayor and their vision and their ideas that they have, Mr. President.

1016
01:27:23,039 --> 01:27:27,201
And on that note, I'd just like to thank Eversource again for appearing.

1017
01:27:28,041 --> 01:27:28,341
Thank you.

1018
01:27:28,361 --> 01:27:29,222
Thank you, Councilor Mox.

1019
01:27:29,622 --> 01:27:31,743
Chair recognizes Vice President Longo Kern.

1020
01:27:32,243 --> 01:27:33,804
Thank you, President DelaRusso.

1021
01:27:34,922 --> 01:27:44,314
My questions were mainly answered, but with regards to the excavation and then the backfill, how long of a stretch will you be doing before you then go and repave the street?

1022
01:27:46,737 --> 01:27:51,442
How much trench are we going to have open in the 3.2 miles in Medford at a time?

1023
01:27:51,583 --> 01:27:52,964
That's kind of my question.

1024
01:27:55,126 --> 01:28:01,408
And I appreciate the frustration of this answer, but we have not yet developed a construction schedule and a construction management plans.

1025
01:28:01,448 --> 01:28:04,850
We are still in what we call the plan project phase.

1026
01:28:05,190 --> 01:28:07,791
So all of that will be discovered at some point.

1027
01:28:07,851 --> 01:28:08,751
We're not there yet.

1028
01:28:08,931 --> 01:28:10,572
However, typically what I will say is

1029
01:28:12,630 --> 01:28:16,712
The trenching crews make an average, as Bill said, about 100 to 150 feet a day.

1030
01:28:17,472 --> 01:28:19,413
That's the forward progress they make.

1031
01:28:20,214 --> 01:28:24,616
And that involves a linear, continuous process.

1032
01:28:24,656 --> 01:28:31,039
The front of this train, if you will, they are saw cutting, they are removing material.

1033
01:28:31,499 --> 01:28:33,460
The middle of the train is then coming in and

1034
01:28:34,520 --> 01:28:42,861
putting in forms and putting in the pipe work and then behind that comes the concrete fill work and then the pavement after that.

1035
01:28:44,082 --> 01:29:02,067
How much of that, generally, we do want to keep it in line with the progress, but at the same time, if we can get in and get out faster, if it makes sense to, you know, say, start the saw cutting now while we're still finishing up the pavement, because perhaps it's before a holiday weekend, we may extend that.

1036
01:29:02,427 --> 01:29:04,788
You know, all those considerations come into account.

1037
01:29:05,828 --> 01:29:07,329
All that to say, there's not a formula.

1038
01:29:07,909 --> 01:29:11,710
It really does depend on the area in question and the timing of where we're at.

1039
01:29:12,132 --> 01:29:17,076
Okay, so you don't cut up the 100, 150 feet a day and then fill it the next day.

1040
01:29:17,096 --> 01:29:20,319
It could be, you know, you could go a couple times.

1041
01:29:20,439 --> 01:29:22,220
We would close it every night.

1042
01:29:22,541 --> 01:29:23,682
It would never be left open.

1043
01:29:23,902 --> 01:29:30,187
We would have it plated every night so that there would always be access when we're not working that for that 150 feet.

1044
01:29:30,787 --> 01:29:33,790
And we hear you loud and clear that this is a concern of yours.

1045
01:29:34,290 --> 01:29:37,552
and we will certainly factor this into our scheduling.

1046
01:29:38,032 --> 01:29:48,198
We understand that there is a fatigue on construction and we would like to try to mitigate that impact on the residents of Medford.

1047
01:29:48,238 --> 01:30:00,285
And my second point, I agree with Councillor Knight with regards to a traffic light study and then my suggestion obviously was going to be a traffic impact study, but can you go into a little

1048
01:30:00,766 --> 01:30:11,469
more detail with regards to the traffic impact study that will be done beforehand so that we make sure there's, you know, least disturbance to the already enough traffic that we already have.

1049
01:30:11,849 --> 01:30:19,351
Because we're talking about some of the highly congested areas of Mystic Ave, Main Street, South Street, Winthrop Street.

1050
01:30:19,411 --> 01:30:21,552
Those are some of the busiest streets.

1051
01:30:21,612 --> 01:30:26,473
I mean, in the morning, Councilman Locke mentioned, you can't get through Medford Square to the high schools.

1052
01:30:27,169 --> 01:30:33,914
is a mess, Mystic Ave leading into Somerville, McGrath Highway is always backed up, so it would be nice if...

1053
01:30:35,188 --> 01:30:39,071
detailed studies were done to create as least impact as possible.

1054
01:30:39,511 --> 01:30:44,874
We are bringing in a professional traffic management engineering firm.

1055
01:30:46,235 --> 01:30:50,658
This is what they specialize in, or one of the fields they specialize in.

1056
01:30:50,678 --> 01:30:51,478
They will be coming in.

1057
01:30:51,498 --> 01:30:55,981
They will be looking at each municipality, at each area where the project goes through.

1058
01:30:57,162 --> 01:30:59,604
They might do actual traffic count measurements.

1059
01:30:59,644 --> 01:31:01,405
That's yet to be determined how their approach

1060
01:31:01,918 --> 01:31:06,922
And how they'll do that, they would come back with recommendations after studying the areas.

1061
01:31:07,843 --> 01:31:11,826
Essentially, how can we build this project with the least amount of traffic impact?

1062
01:31:11,886 --> 01:31:15,069
That is the task they are charged with providing to us.

1063
01:31:15,629 --> 01:31:21,234
That, to get to that final product, they would make, you would do research with the municipalities.

1064
01:31:21,274 --> 01:31:22,755
They'd bring back recommendations to us.

1065
01:31:23,175 --> 01:31:27,699
We would bring back preliminary conclusions to the municipalities, again,

1066
01:31:28,364 --> 01:31:36,446
whether it be to councils or whether it be to engineering departments, get the input, get the local knowledge that our engineers may not have from you.

1067
01:31:37,267 --> 01:31:38,887
That gets incorporated into the plan.

1068
01:31:39,727 --> 01:31:40,027
Thank you.

1069
01:31:40,068 --> 01:31:46,589
And then this council has discussed hiring a traffic engineer within our engineering department.

1070
01:31:47,130 --> 01:31:54,672
So you'll be given recommendations, but will you also furnish the results of the studies to the engineering department?

1071
01:31:54,692 --> 01:31:54,872
Yes.

1072
01:31:56,068 --> 01:32:11,531
make that part of the committee report that any traffic studies that are done by this professional management firm, any results along with the recommendations be furnished to our engineering department for any future help that it could give past this project.

1073
01:32:11,551 --> 01:32:15,291
I think that would be helpful because I do see something like that in the future.

1074
01:32:16,172 --> 01:32:19,352
And the traffic management plans would be approved by the city.

1075
01:32:19,492 --> 01:32:21,452
I mean, we wouldn't be doing this on our own.

1076
01:32:21,673 --> 01:32:24,293
We would be looking for city approval.

1077
01:32:25,387 --> 01:32:26,647
I thank you very much for coming.

1078
01:32:26,667 --> 01:32:31,428
I hope that we can maybe get another update in six months so that we can keep on top of the project.

1079
01:32:31,728 --> 01:32:36,309
We're getting calls all the time when people start hearing about this street's getting dug up again.

1080
01:32:36,409 --> 01:32:41,510
So I thank you for coming, and I appreciate the slideshow that you've provided us.

1081
01:32:42,130 --> 01:32:43,891
It's helpful to stay on top of it.

1082
01:32:46,791 --> 01:32:47,991
Thank you, Madam Vice President.

1083
01:32:48,051 --> 01:32:49,752
Chair recognizes Councilor Carviello.

1084
01:32:50,132 --> 01:32:50,912
Thank you, Mr. President.

1085
01:32:52,807 --> 01:33:09,015
As you know, we have a growing bicycle community, and I would hope that you would reach out to that committee, the Bicycle Advisory Committee, and discuss with them, because I'm sure you'll be taking over some of the new bike paths, bike lanes that have just been put in.

1086
01:33:10,015 --> 01:33:12,477
So if you could reach out to that group.

1087
01:33:17,339 --> 01:33:21,441
Because some of the streets you're going down are where the mayor has put the new bike lanes.

1088
01:33:23,497 --> 01:33:27,518
If there's a contact, if you could provide it to us, we will reach out to them.

1089
01:33:27,778 --> 01:33:28,438
Okay.

1090
01:33:28,598 --> 01:33:30,079
I will give the contact person your name.

1091
01:33:30,339 --> 01:33:30,599
Okay.

1092
01:33:30,799 --> 01:33:31,059
Thank you.

1093
01:33:33,059 --> 01:33:33,359
Thank you.

1094
01:33:33,379 --> 01:33:49,903
So on the, uh, motion of council night as amended by, uh, council Longo Kern, uh, to receive this paper and to, uh, act on those items that were requested and that we can also, uh,

1095
01:33:50,528 --> 01:34:07,917
schedule with you folks a follow-up meeting in the next term in six months or so so that we can be updated and the citizens can be updated and also hopefully we can do a better job at announcing the meeting so that more citizens can be present.

1096
01:34:08,477 --> 01:34:11,458
And in the interim, if there's any concerns, please contact us.

1097
01:34:11,618 --> 01:34:20,442
You know, we are available and we're happy to, to engage and try to find answers or address any concerns that need to do with that.

1098
01:34:20,922 --> 01:34:22,563
This has been very helpful for all of us.

1099
01:34:23,023 --> 01:34:28,386
And for the same sense, I think there's one citizen that wants to speak on this before you adjourned this matter.

1100
01:34:28,406 --> 01:34:31,287
If you'd like to please state your name and address for the record.

1101
01:34:31,637 --> 01:34:32,657
My name is Michael Ruggiero.

1102
01:34:32,957 --> 01:34:34,998
I live on 18 Pembroke Street.

1103
01:34:35,178 --> 01:34:36,918
I'm an intervener in this project.

1104
01:34:37,539 --> 01:34:42,080
And there's a couple of things I want to say before I move on to some other points.

1105
01:34:42,660 --> 01:34:45,381
The first is the general tone of this conversation.

1106
01:34:45,421 --> 01:34:47,201
This project has not been approved yet.

1107
01:34:47,721 --> 01:34:51,482
And I think that's important that we consider the pros and cons of this project.

1108
01:34:52,463 --> 01:34:59,225
The gentleman from Eversource mentioned that there would be significant rate improvements as a result of this project.

1109
01:35:00,995 --> 01:35:03,077
There are no guarantees to rate payers.

1110
01:35:03,277 --> 01:35:11,785
As of right now, this project is roughly slated to be about $74 million, and those $74 million will come directly out of our pockets.

1111
01:35:12,666 --> 01:35:21,094
I want to read a prepared statement I have about this issue in particular, because I think it's important that I make sure I say all the things that I want to.

1112
01:35:23,669 --> 01:35:33,331
At City Hall on July 15th, Eversource presented its plan for an 8-mile, $74 million power line, which they hope to build underground along Main Street and Route 38.

1113
01:35:34,611 --> 01:35:40,893
Many citizens from Medford, myself included, voiced their objections to this initial power line presentation.

1114
01:35:41,493 --> 01:35:43,353
There's a couple of points I want to bring up here.

1115
01:35:43,913 --> 01:35:47,654
Unfortunately, while I really appreciate Eversource coming down, there

1116
01:35:48,248 --> 01:35:54,353
And all the questions that the citizens of Medford asked at July 15th have not been addressed.

1117
01:35:54,793 --> 01:36:00,618
There were about five major flavors of questions, and I'm just going to go through them one by one.

1118
01:36:02,380 --> 01:36:14,930
While Eversource's power line improvement is intended to benefit the citizens of greater Boston, it's really opaque to understand exactly how Medford will receive any improvements whatsoever.

1119
01:36:16,070 --> 01:36:18,753
I think that this was a major theme throughout the night.

1120
01:36:18,833 --> 01:36:26,800
Why is Medford going to be shouldering the responsibility if much of this Power Live improvement is greater New England?

1121
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:30,243
That's a very vague term of what's going to be improved.

1122
01:36:30,283 --> 01:36:35,308
So I think there needs to be a point-by-point analysis on why Medford needs this plan.

1123
01:36:36,689 --> 01:36:41,333
The $74 million price tag will be covered by rate payers.

1124
01:36:41,902 --> 01:36:45,644
And it's disappointing that this price tag has not been included in this presentation.

1125
01:36:46,765 --> 01:36:53,349
Understandably, they didn't want to perhaps spook people, but I think it's an important element knowing that we're going to be paying for this.

1126
01:36:54,309 --> 01:37:02,914
And as was mentioned at the conversation, there was a lot of concerns about traffic and environmental impact.

1127
01:37:03,295 --> 01:37:07,037
And unfortunately, while once again, you know, I understand you all are very busy,

1128
01:37:07,532 --> 01:37:12,795
it would have been good to actually see more information about what is the environmental impact of this.

1129
01:37:12,915 --> 01:37:14,215
It's going to have an impact.

1130
01:37:14,615 --> 01:37:21,479
Now, I'm sure Eversource will do the best it can to minimize that impact, but it will have an impact on our roads and our environment.

1131
01:37:21,939 --> 01:37:23,740
So how is that going to be mitigated?

1132
01:37:24,200 --> 01:37:30,403
Currently, there is a multi-prong evidentiary process that's going on right now.

1133
01:37:30,954 --> 01:37:35,797
Currently there's 28 pages of unanswered questions that various citizens have asked.

1134
01:37:36,657 --> 01:37:44,922
The city of Somerville is in fact an intervener on the process, not an intervener, they're a step below intervener, but they're engaging in this process.

1135
01:37:45,102 --> 01:37:48,924
I would encourage everyone on this council to engage with it more as well.

1136
01:37:49,004 --> 01:37:55,748
If you would like to view the 28 pages of questions or any of the documents that I have access to being an intervener in this project,

1137
01:37:56,216 --> 01:37:57,596
please call me at any time.

1138
01:37:57,657 --> 01:38:01,638
I'm more than happy to furnish that information, as I'm sure Eversource is as well.

1139
01:38:04,059 --> 01:38:06,900
At the meeting, I asked four main questions.

1140
01:38:07,640 --> 01:38:17,923
And one of the big questions I would like to hear answered, and it's in this 28 pages of questions that Eversource has to respond to, is basically, why is this necessary?

1141
01:38:18,243 --> 01:38:22,665
With improvements in alternative energy sources, from solar to wind,

1142
01:38:23,199 --> 01:38:25,800
Why is it that we need to build basically another pipeline?

1143
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:26,761
Because that's what this is.

1144
01:38:27,201 --> 01:38:28,141
It's a pipeline.

1145
01:38:28,181 --> 01:38:30,202
Now, of course, electricity is going through it.

1146
01:38:30,662 --> 01:38:31,763
But are there other options?

1147
01:38:32,463 --> 01:38:35,484
I'm sure Eversource will do the best they can answering their questions.

1148
01:38:35,905 --> 01:38:40,247
Currently, the way I stand on this whole process is I'm not really sure.

1149
01:38:40,707 --> 01:38:42,247
Maybe it is the best thing for Medford.

1150
01:38:42,608 --> 01:38:43,308
Maybe it's not.

1151
01:38:43,828 --> 01:38:50,091
But they are required by law to provide an alternative strategy for this process.

1152
01:38:50,151 --> 01:38:52,492
Now, Eversource, as of right now, have provided

1153
01:38:53,071 --> 01:39:01,877
an alternative pipeline, another much longer road that would tear up many more streets than the current preferred plan.

1154
01:39:02,778 --> 01:39:04,799
But this is sort of a false choice.

1155
01:39:04,879 --> 01:39:09,803
It's like going to a diner and there's two choices on the menu, scrambled eggs or eggs sunny side up.

1156
01:39:10,143 --> 01:39:11,164
It's still eggs, right?

1157
01:39:11,644 --> 01:39:17,428
So what I really hope to see from Eversource is why other options will not solve these problems.

1158
01:39:17,809 --> 01:39:22,452
And as of right now, I mean, because they're working with the interveners to answer these questions,

1159
01:39:22,815 --> 01:39:24,836
They haven't presented many of these answers yet.

1160
01:39:25,336 --> 01:39:30,979
So I think it's important that we remind ourselves that this is a big project, and it is not finalized yet.

1161
01:39:31,639 --> 01:39:34,080
Eversource has many different hurdles to overcome.

1162
01:39:34,620 --> 01:39:35,801
But here's what we do know.

1163
01:39:36,261 --> 01:39:38,362
The process will be expensive.

1164
01:39:38,922 --> 01:39:40,943
It will have an impact on our society.

1165
01:39:41,544 --> 01:39:46,486
I would encourage everyone to think seriously about this process that's going to cost us

1166
01:39:46,973 --> 01:39:47,353
in the end.

1167
01:39:47,453 --> 01:39:56,337
Now, maybe, as the gentleman said, this is part of another sort of project that will help New England immensely.

1168
01:39:56,777 --> 01:40:00,118
But I think we need to consider these ramifications very seriously.

1169
01:40:00,518 --> 01:40:12,363
If anyone at home is interested in receiving any of the documents I have mentioned, please call me any time at 844-TAKE-GVT.

1170
01:40:12,763 --> 01:40:15,804
Thank you very much for allowing me to speak, and thank you very much for Eversource for coming down.

1171
01:40:17,783 --> 01:40:25,230
Sure, my number, once again, is 844-TAKE-GVT.

1172
01:40:25,950 --> 01:40:28,052
So, TAKE-GVT.

1173
01:40:28,152 --> 01:40:34,538
Please, I'm more than happy, you can also email me anytime at mr.takegovernment.com.

1174
01:40:34,658 --> 01:40:38,602
I have access to hundreds of pages of documents, and I'm slowly sort of filtering my way through.

1175
01:40:39,795 --> 01:40:51,624
I would also encourage any electrical engineer... Can the public also be assured that these documents are available through public means, through the commission that oversees utilities as well?

1176
01:40:52,445 --> 01:40:56,808
I'll post them on my website, takegovernment.com, in the next couple of days with the campaign.

1177
01:40:56,828 --> 01:40:58,229
It's been a little hectic.

1178
01:40:58,489 --> 01:40:59,110
Thank you, everyone.

1179
01:41:01,632 --> 01:41:02,913
Chair recognizes Councillor Knight.

1180
01:41:04,013 --> 01:41:06,015
I think that the folks from Eversource have already

1181
01:41:06,482 --> 01:41:08,663
reiterated the fact that they would be more than willing to do that.

1182
01:41:08,863 --> 01:41:24,232
And as such, you know, Mr. Zamparelli is the Eversource Community Relations Specialist for our municipality, and he can be reached at William.Zamparelli, Z-A-M-P-A-R-E-L-L-I, at Eversource.com.

1183
01:41:24,292 --> 01:41:33,238
And I think many of us that are familiar with the city of Medford are very familiar with that last name, the late John Zamparelli, who represented our city with great pride, Mr. President.

1184
01:41:34,407 --> 01:41:37,769
contact that other source would be Mr. Zamparelli, and that's how he can be reached as well.

1185
01:41:37,849 --> 01:41:40,431
I think it's always good to get the info from the horse's mouth.

1186
01:41:41,052 --> 01:41:41,392
Thank you.

1187
01:41:42,793 --> 01:41:43,493
Good evening, sir.

1188
01:41:43,873 --> 01:41:45,755
I'd like to state your name and address for the record.

1189
01:41:45,855 --> 01:41:49,377
I'm Nick Tomazook, 29 Garfield Avenue, Medford.

1190
01:41:49,817 --> 01:41:51,659
I only have two simple questions.

1191
01:41:52,799 --> 01:41:59,644
If they researched an existing route, with all those manhole covers out there, there's no existing route they can put their lines through?

1192
01:42:00,825 --> 01:42:03,667
Like the cable lines, they're putting them through existing manholes.

1193
01:42:04,930 --> 01:42:07,131
You know, isn't there a way to go that way?

1194
01:42:07,891 --> 01:42:11,372
And then the other question is, who's going to be the superpower?

1195
01:42:11,392 --> 01:42:13,512
The bridge builders or the cable guys?

1196
01:42:15,913 --> 01:42:19,714
Because they're going to come together in Main Street and Mystic Avenue.

1197
01:42:20,914 --> 01:42:25,456
So now you have the bridge a block away, and you have the power line another block away.

1198
01:42:27,276 --> 01:42:31,017
So you've got to figure out, because that area is going to be so congested.

1199
01:42:32,137 --> 01:42:34,418
The only thing is, who's going to be the superpower there?

1200
01:42:35,042 --> 01:42:35,422
Exactly.

1201
01:42:35,802 --> 01:42:44,006
I think one of the goals that they've had is to engage an outside traffic consultant who's going to analyze.

1202
01:42:44,407 --> 01:42:57,453
That's one of the particular areas that needs a strong analysis because of the impact of the ongoing bridge construction as it affects the development of the trenching.

1203
01:42:57,833 --> 01:43:01,475
The only thing is these traffic consultants, they don't live in the city.

1204
01:43:02,764 --> 01:43:08,186
They may come at a real slow time and not come during rush hour.

1205
01:43:08,986 --> 01:43:13,248
I mean, that traffic backs up up Main Street, up past George Street and beyond.

1206
01:43:13,608 --> 01:43:13,828
Yes.

1207
01:43:14,388 --> 01:43:16,409
You know, trying to make the left on Mystic Ave.

1208
01:43:17,629 --> 01:43:27,933
So what's going to happen now when they close that bridge, move it over, and you've got the construction in Main Street, in Mystic, and then you have a block away, you have the bridge?

1209
01:43:29,333 --> 01:43:32,094
The gentleman is taking notes on that as we speak.

1210
01:43:33,012 --> 01:43:35,454
uh, to make that as part of their, uh, research.

1211
01:43:36,175 --> 01:43:36,475
Okay.

1212
01:43:36,515 --> 01:43:39,637
And then another thing is I want to wish you all guys good luck.

1213
01:43:39,897 --> 01:43:41,899
Got a bunch of good city counselors.

1214
01:43:41,999 --> 01:43:47,103
If anybody wants to put a sign up on my property, 29 Garfield Avenue, help yourself.

1215
01:43:48,024 --> 01:43:48,984
I have plenty of fence.

1216
01:43:50,265 --> 01:43:52,087
So bring them down.

1217
01:43:52,647 --> 01:43:53,088
Thanks.

1218
01:43:55,389 --> 01:43:56,210
Good evening, ma'am.

1219
01:43:56,250 --> 01:43:57,911
Please state your name and address for the record.

1220
01:43:58,412 --> 01:43:58,732
Welcome.

1221
01:43:59,329 --> 01:44:02,912
Hi, I'm Kate Adams, and I live at 21 Blaisdell Road, Medford.

1222
01:44:04,093 --> 01:44:11,319
I'm here tonight attending on behalf of the policy committee of the Mystic River Watershed Association.

1223
01:44:12,640 --> 01:44:19,465
And it's been very interesting and informative to hear what the Eversource people have had to say.

1224
01:44:20,386 --> 01:44:27,852
And it kind of explains a little bit that you're only about halfway through the engineering process, and that's why we've not heard

1225
01:44:28,343 --> 01:44:29,264
a few more details.

1226
01:44:30,084 --> 01:44:44,795
The Watershed Association is primarily concerned with the water quality, habitat, and access to the Mystic River, as well as the Aberjona River and the Malden River, and the other tributaries, which, of course, feed the watershed of the Mystic River.

1227
01:44:47,017 --> 01:44:54,683
We have some specific concerns with, in this case, the Winthrop and South Street crossing of the river.

1228
01:44:55,141 --> 01:45:01,603
some of which it's been allayed by the idea that it's going to go under the river and not through the river, which makes a big difference.

1229
01:45:01,703 --> 01:45:25,031
But there's still some concerns about access to the river bank and through the area and the condon shell and for people, say, putting in kayaks or coming to the river to walk their dogs or even for school kids walking through the area trying to get across to the schools which are on the opposite side of Mystic Valley Parkway.

1230
01:45:25,313 --> 01:45:31,595
sometimes kids come from those neighborhoods and they use, you know, so there needs to be still some preservation of access through the area.

1231
01:45:32,515 --> 01:45:40,337
Um, I have some concerns having, um, put in my kayak on the South street side that there's, are some erosion issues.

1232
01:45:40,477 --> 01:45:49,180
And if there's trees taken out or other types of activity in the construction on that side of the river, you know, that could affect water quality.

1233
01:45:49,914 --> 01:46:04,558
I think one of the bigger concerns the watershed has is the herring runs are just now coming back, now that there's new access up a fish ladder, and we don't want to interfere with that comeback of the herring on the river.

1234
01:46:04,618 --> 01:46:18,662
It's been a very big deal for the ecosystem of the watershed, and we want to make sure that since they run from generally from April through the end of June, we want to make sure that the activities don't impact

1235
01:46:19,462 --> 01:46:20,102
that herring run.

1236
01:46:20,622 --> 01:46:25,403
And finally, there's the public garden, which has been mentioned.

1237
01:46:25,423 --> 01:46:28,544
I want to make sure that that isn't seriously disrupted.

1238
01:46:28,584 --> 01:46:31,024
People put a lot of effort into building that.

1239
01:46:31,404 --> 01:46:34,325
And that's an important draw to the river area.

1240
01:46:34,805 --> 01:46:40,826
It has to do with the access to the river and also to people's enjoyment of it, which is important for the watershed as well.

1241
01:46:41,826 --> 01:46:45,567
So I look forward to working with you

1242
01:46:46,599 --> 01:46:58,064
And also, if anybody in the City Council has concerns that have to do with the river and the water quality and the watershed, please feel free to contact the Watershed Association.

1243
01:46:58,585 --> 01:46:58,905
Thank you.

1244
01:47:03,947 --> 01:47:04,487
Good evening.

1245
01:47:04,927 --> 01:47:06,608
Please state your name and address for the record.

1246
01:47:06,928 --> 01:47:07,289
Welcome.

1247
01:47:07,629 --> 01:47:10,530
Valerie Geiselman, 318 High Street, Medford.

1248
01:47:12,205 --> 01:47:14,467
I'd like to ask about the manhole covers.

1249
01:47:14,687 --> 01:47:23,875
We have a few that make a lot of clicky-clack noise from the electric company still outside along High Street, particularly between Walcott Street and Wilburn Street.

1250
01:47:23,895 --> 01:47:25,196
Those are the ones that I can hear.

1251
01:47:26,197 --> 01:47:33,163
And just want to express my concern that any manhole covers would not be making any noise.

1252
01:47:33,243 --> 01:47:36,386
And if they should get loose, they would be dealt with promptly.

1253
01:47:38,047 --> 01:47:39,148
They've just made note of that.

1254
01:47:41,326 --> 01:47:42,366
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear what you said.

1255
01:47:43,247 --> 01:47:48,169
They've just made note of that and they've had right behind you as you were speaking, they were writing.

1256
01:47:48,369 --> 01:47:48,989
So thank you.

1257
01:47:49,129 --> 01:47:51,690
I think it's a clear message received.

1258
01:47:52,230 --> 01:47:52,450
Yes.

1259
01:47:52,470 --> 01:47:55,051
Chair recognizes Councilor Camuso.

1260
01:47:55,112 --> 01:48:06,256
If I may, can we also send to the superintendent of Y is in the DPW commissioner on behalf of the resident to check the manhole covers currently at between Walcott and Woburn on high street, correct?

1261
01:48:06,979 --> 01:48:11,122
If they can do something to tidy them up so that, especially now that the snow plowing and stuff is going to stop.

1262
01:48:11,142 --> 01:48:13,844
I hate to even think about it, but within a few months, so.

1263
01:48:14,304 --> 01:48:15,905
As amended by Councilor Camuso.

1264
01:48:16,566 --> 01:48:17,186
Sir, if you can.

1265
01:48:18,107 --> 01:48:19,248
My name is Michael Ruggiero.

1266
01:48:19,308 --> 01:48:20,369
I live on 18 Pembroke Street.

1267
01:48:20,389 --> 01:48:21,990
I just want to give a clarification.

1268
01:48:22,250 --> 01:48:25,813
Saying the letters to my number might not have been the most useful for everyone.

1269
01:48:25,873 --> 01:48:27,334
So my number is 844-825-7000.

1270
01:48:31,660 --> 01:48:39,186
3, 4, 8, 8.

1271
01:48:32,521 --> 01:48:39,186
If anyone is interested in talking about the documents I have access to, I'm happy to help send anything away, as I'm sure the people of Everstar as well.

1272
01:48:39,266 --> 01:48:41,147
Everyone has access to those documents.

1273
01:48:42,688 --> 01:48:45,650
On the motion of Councillor Knight as amended, all those in favour?

1274
01:48:48,832 --> 01:48:50,374
Just one last question, if I have a source.

1275
01:48:52,615 --> 01:48:58,039
I don't think we discussed the potential disruption to driveways.

1276
01:48:58,079 --> 01:48:59,420
There's many driveways along the

1277
01:49:00,194 --> 01:49:01,755
uh, course of this route.

1278
01:49:02,536 --> 01:49:09,961
Um, and, uh, will residents be notified that they won't have access to their driveway for particular periods of time?

1279
01:49:10,021 --> 01:49:16,806
I'm sure during the construction, there may be hours and hopefully just a few hours that they won't have access.

1280
01:49:17,346 --> 01:49:18,467
How will that notification,

1281
01:49:18,962 --> 01:49:19,903
be sent to residents.

1282
01:49:19,943 --> 01:49:21,164
We have a number of ways.

1283
01:49:21,324 --> 01:49:22,345
One is our website.

1284
01:49:22,625 --> 01:49:28,171
But what we will probably be doing is actually flyering the neighborhood that we're in.

1285
01:49:28,631 --> 01:49:39,942
If we're going to be in an area that's going to be working at that street, and we know we're going to be there the following week, we will notify them that we're going to be working in that neighborhood.

1286
01:49:40,302 --> 01:49:42,504
So that they'll know that we're where we are.

1287
01:49:42,524 --> 01:49:44,126
And they'll see us coming, basically.

1288
01:49:44,506 --> 01:49:45,968
So what do you anticipate?

1289
01:49:46,428 --> 01:50:03,725
If I may add to that as well, just to clarify, yes, we do the general outreach, we do the specific door hanger outreach, but also to be clear, it's not that anyone would ever lose access to their driveway, particularly for a safety issue that is a requirement of the contractors.

1290
01:50:04,935 --> 01:50:11,080
Long story short, if there is an open trench in front of a driveway, there's always a steel plate available on the construction site.

1291
01:50:11,500 --> 01:50:19,987
So should a resident need to access, or should there be an emergency issue where there needs to be egress ingress, we can always provide that via the steel plate.

1292
01:50:20,828 --> 01:50:22,049
Obviously, we try to coordinate.

1293
01:50:22,409 --> 01:50:28,234
If someone's going to be leaving their house a dozen times in the day, we would try to not do our work during that time if it can be avoided.

1294
01:50:28,854 --> 01:50:32,197
But we would not cut off a resident's access to their home.

1295
01:50:33,468 --> 01:50:37,161
So residents will have access to their driveway throughout this whole project.

1296
01:50:37,322 --> 01:50:39,309
There won't be any interruption.

1297
01:50:40,602 --> 01:50:47,247
We may have to coordinate with them, but they would always have access.

1298
01:50:47,467 --> 01:50:55,533
If we had to dig in front of their driveway, we would be able to put a plate down if they needed to get access to it.

1299
01:50:56,613 --> 01:51:03,198
Obviously, if we're doing 150 feet a day, we're probably going to be there in front of the driveway for an hour or two.

1300
01:51:04,279 --> 01:51:08,342
And so if we can coordinate it so that they can get in and out

1301
01:51:09,240 --> 01:51:11,382
We get there to do the construction, that's all the better.

1302
01:51:11,522 --> 01:51:15,566
If not, then we'll work with them to try to ensure that they have access.

1303
01:51:15,666 --> 01:51:20,511
So when the machine's doing the digging, you're talking a good hour and a half maybe in front of a driveway then?

1304
01:51:20,911 --> 01:51:22,493
The length of a driveway, five, six feet?

1305
01:51:22,693 --> 01:51:22,893
Right.

1306
01:51:23,273 --> 01:51:24,815
You're talking a good hour, an hour and a half.

1307
01:51:26,396 --> 01:51:26,797
I would just...

1308
01:51:27,532 --> 01:51:34,074
you know, but as David indicated, we will have plates that we, if they had to get in and out.

1309
01:51:34,094 --> 01:51:40,835
I mean, obviously it'd be better if we could let them in or let them out when they needed to get, get to get access.

1310
01:51:41,496 --> 01:51:42,896
Uh, and we try to coordinate that.

1311
01:51:43,356 --> 01:51:49,798
If for some reason that isn't possible, we'll have the ability to put a plate down to ensure that they do have access.

1312
01:51:49,858 --> 01:51:50,158
Thank you.

1313
01:51:50,578 --> 01:51:54,959
There were a couple of things that were raised here today and I should just try to clarify it.

1314
01:51:54,979 --> 01:51:55,199
I think,

1315
01:51:56,017 --> 01:51:59,160
Some of the benefit, I think, is not fully understood.

1316
01:51:59,180 --> 01:52:01,581
And maybe let me speak a little bit to that.

1317
01:52:02,082 --> 01:52:03,002
I think it's important.

1318
01:52:03,222 --> 01:52:09,507
While this is a regional project, it will be paid for by the regional customers, the rate payers.

1319
01:52:10,007 --> 01:52:14,210
And so it's not just the greater Boston or the city of Medford rate payers.

1320
01:52:14,270 --> 01:52:19,194
It's all of New England's power grid rate payers that will pay for these improvements.

1321
01:52:19,634 --> 01:52:24,598
And this is just one of about 40 some projects that are being done throughout the state.

1322
01:52:25,085 --> 01:52:29,726
throughout New England to improve the interconnectivity between stations.

1323
01:52:30,706 --> 01:52:49,050
This is significant because it allows for about an $800 million annual savings in generation costs once all of the 40-some projects are in place, because now ISO New England has the ability to call up the least cost generator.

1324
01:52:50,642 --> 01:52:55,524
It's usually done by what the kilowatt hour cost is for that generation.

1325
01:52:56,045 --> 01:53:05,269
Because of limitations in the connections between stations currently, they have to call up certain generation that is much more expensive than the least cost.

1326
01:53:06,149 --> 01:53:12,952
Once this is in place, they will have that benefit to realize about an $800 million annual savings.

1327
01:53:13,756 --> 01:53:16,360
over the, you know, going forward.

1328
01:53:16,400 --> 01:53:22,731
That's based on the current cost of power that could change based on what cost of power would be in the future.

1329
01:53:24,304 --> 01:53:33,766
But I think it is a significant reliability improvement for the greater Boston area and southern New England, southern New Hampshire.

1330
01:53:33,906 --> 01:53:40,508
And it will absolutely improve economic competitiveness in this region.

1331
01:53:41,928 --> 01:53:42,568
Thank you.

1332
01:53:42,868 --> 01:53:46,929
Thank you very much for your presentation tonight.

1333
01:53:47,489 --> 01:53:49,270
I think we have one more point, Mr. Chairman.

1334
01:53:49,910 --> 01:53:50,330
I'm sorry.

1335
01:53:50,470 --> 01:53:50,770
If I may.

1336
01:53:53,404 --> 01:54:00,809
Just to address one other issue that was brought up that I think is worth mentioning about project alternatives and, you know, the necessity of the project.

1337
01:54:01,930 --> 01:54:03,971
It was, you know, perhaps alluded to that.

1338
01:54:04,031 --> 01:54:05,212
We did not answer that question.

1339
01:54:05,553 --> 01:54:09,135
It has been asked by the EFSB.

1340
01:54:09,735 --> 01:54:13,118
It has been answered in our initial petition.

1341
01:54:13,873 --> 01:54:17,837
that is available online via EFSB DPU.

1342
01:54:17,857 --> 01:54:19,218
There's a link on our website.

1343
01:54:19,758 --> 01:54:23,021
This is part of the filing that is at the Bedford Public Library.

1344
01:54:23,722 --> 01:54:31,429
It is a very long and technically detailed analysis of needs, not just of the

1345
01:54:32,177 --> 01:54:47,623
routes, the preferred and noticed route, but also addressing why can't renewable generation or energy efficiency or other type issues that has all been asked and answered and it's available for anyone to read today.

1346
01:54:49,043 --> 01:54:49,964
Mr. President.

1347
01:54:51,424 --> 01:54:52,065
Councillor Marks.

1348
01:54:52,945 --> 01:54:54,866
The utilities now are assessed.

1349
01:54:55,126 --> 01:54:58,287
So what was the assessment for the City of Method, do you know?

1350
01:55:06,959 --> 01:55:23,168
I don't know what that number is, but I can tell you the way it usually works is it's on the real personal property side, and we do what they call a form of list, and we list all of the assets that are in service in the community.

1351
01:55:24,108 --> 01:55:29,252
This transmission line will pay taxes to the community every year.

1352
01:55:30,352 --> 01:55:33,654
It is a depreciated net value over time.

1353
01:55:34,075 --> 01:55:43,941
But the idea is that they will, for every foot of utility that's in service in the city, that they will generate a tax benefit.

1354
01:55:44,021 --> 01:55:45,442
And I can find out what that number is.

1355
01:55:45,522 --> 01:55:46,863
The Vice President If you could, I think that'd be helpful.

1356
01:55:46,883 --> 01:55:47,423
Mr. Kudlow Absolutely.

1357
01:55:47,443 --> 01:55:52,347
The Vice President Thank you.

1358
01:55:52,367 --> 01:55:52,867
Thank you, Mr. President.

1359
01:55:53,415 --> 01:55:54,276
Thank you, Councillor.

1360
01:55:55,056 --> 01:55:58,558
So on the motion of Councillor Knight, as amended, all those in favour?

1361
01:55:59,419 --> 01:56:00,119
All those opposed?

1362
01:56:00,960 --> 01:56:03,001
Thank you very much for your time.

1363
01:56:03,541 --> 01:56:06,984
Thank you to the citizens who made the time to come down and present.

1364
01:56:07,964 --> 01:56:09,845
We look forward to continuing the conversation.

1365
01:56:09,865 --> 01:56:12,727
If you have any other concerns, please contact us.

1366
01:56:13,268 --> 01:56:13,648
Thank you.

1367
01:56:13,688 --> 01:56:13,988
Thank you.

1368
01:56:14,729 --> 01:56:17,610
Continuing with petitions, presentations, and similar matters, 15-711.

1369
01:56:18,311 --> 01:56:20,752
Chair recognizes Councillor Knight.

1370
01:56:24,575 --> 01:56:30,059
When I got an email relative to this very issue after the May 20th meeting, I placed a call to the city assessor.

1371
01:56:30,679 --> 01:56:36,863
And right now, the proposed tax levy on underground utilities in the city of Medford is $73 million.

1372
01:56:37,963 --> 01:56:42,426
$73 million will be very helpful to all of us.

1373
01:56:42,446 --> 01:56:52,492
15-711, petitioned by Jean M. Martin, 10 Cumming Street, Medford, Mass., to speak to the council about money collected through the parking program and police training.

1374
01:56:53,017 --> 01:56:53,197
Ms.

1375
01:56:53,217 --> 01:56:53,957
Martin, welcome.

1376
01:56:54,297 --> 01:56:56,018
Please state your name and address for the record again.

1377
01:56:56,118 --> 01:56:56,658
Jean Martin.

1378
01:56:56,698 --> 01:56:57,118
Good evening.

1379
01:56:57,978 --> 01:56:59,719
10 Cumming Street.

1380
01:57:00,579 --> 01:57:08,581
Let's remember why we have meters in the first place, because outsiders were parking in our squares all day for free and riding into town.

1381
01:57:11,422 --> 01:57:16,683
We also had store owners and workers parking in front of their stores, taking up customer spots.

1382
01:57:19,063 --> 01:57:21,204
And also, I just want to remind people

1383
01:57:21,735 --> 01:57:25,298
that the permits, parking, we have been already paying.

1384
01:57:26,078 --> 01:57:35,805
People that live in the city before we even had meters were paying $10 a year to pay to park on our own street.

1385
01:57:36,726 --> 01:57:40,448
So that money has already been out there, just to remind you of that, too.

1386
01:57:43,951 --> 01:57:49,435
You recall that we didn't want to waste professional time of police officers on parking enforcement.

1387
01:57:50,237 --> 01:57:58,481
And while we have accomplished this goal, make no mistake that parking enforcement ultimately still comes under the auspices of the police department.

1388
01:57:59,642 --> 01:58:12,549
Now, while some of you will throw tomatoes at me because I know that not everybody agrees with this pay for parking issue, I have to say that I'm okay paying for parking for the following reasons.

1389
01:58:13,590 --> 01:58:15,771
No one plan will satisfy everyone.

1390
01:58:16,611 --> 01:58:17,752
That's worth repeating again.

1391
01:58:18,940 --> 01:58:21,301
No one plan will satisfy everyone.

1392
01:58:21,922 --> 01:58:24,203
This includes the two-hour or three-hour limit.

1393
01:58:25,524 --> 01:58:29,046
Someone will always say it is too short a time for some reason.

1394
01:58:29,666 --> 01:58:35,490
This city has had a free parking program for so long, it doesn't want any change at all.

1395
01:58:37,411 --> 01:58:38,392
We need to admit that.

1396
01:58:39,352 --> 01:58:41,714
That said, it should not be punitive.

1397
01:58:42,194 --> 01:58:45,016
The amount could be as little as 25 cents for a half an hour.

1398
01:58:46,552 --> 01:58:48,933
It doesn't have to be 25 cents for 15 minutes.

1399
01:58:49,853 --> 01:58:55,175
The point of paying is to create accountability and not milk the people.

1400
01:58:56,476 --> 01:59:00,257
Free parking for two hours without a ticket creates a problem.

1401
01:59:01,578 --> 01:59:04,839
You must move your car if you wish to stay in the square.

1402
01:59:05,439 --> 01:59:10,301
And we want people to encourage people to hang out in the square and spend their money.

1403
01:59:11,223 --> 01:59:16,446
I would much rather go out and feed the meter again than move my car and try to find another spot.

1404
01:59:17,227 --> 01:59:20,689
Let's say we grow Medford Square and it is a bustling with life.

1405
01:59:21,490 --> 01:59:26,073
We're going to have to extend the hours till 8 p.m., and in some communities they do that.

1406
01:59:26,853 --> 01:59:30,075
We want people to hang out in the square for four or five hours.

1407
01:59:30,375 --> 01:59:36,800
The longer they stay, the more money we make from the store's businesses, not from the parking.

1408
01:59:37,320 --> 01:59:40,402
We shouldn't really look at it as making money from the parking program.

1409
01:59:41,173 --> 01:59:45,337
This is what I think should happen to any proceeds from the parking program.

1410
01:59:46,117 --> 01:59:49,180
It should be earmarked for mental health and training for police officers.

1411
01:59:49,961 --> 01:59:58,288
The issue of late was only properly resolved because it was on video and we were a national disgrace as a result of it going viral.

1412
01:59:59,469 --> 02:00:05,174
We do not take the mental health of our police officers as seriously as we do their physical health.

1413
02:00:06,095 --> 02:00:08,577
We need to normalize mental health for our officers

1414
02:00:09,034 --> 02:00:10,294
before something else happens.

1415
02:00:11,295 --> 02:00:18,878
We need a zero tolerance policy, but we also can't neglect our responsibility to them and expect stress not to bubble up again.

1416
02:00:22,239 --> 02:00:31,483
While unions protect an officer from being fired by a mayor for flimsy cause, there is a point at which an officer should be taken off the street.

1417
02:00:32,663 --> 02:00:37,925
But I also agree that we need a union to protect the officers in case the mayor's on the take.

1418
02:00:39,081 --> 02:00:47,027
If the mayor is corrupt, right, then he could fire an officer that's doing his job very easily because he has the power to do so.

1419
02:00:47,568 --> 02:00:49,069
So the unions play that role.

1420
02:00:50,610 --> 02:00:54,052
While unions have a say, they don't have the last say.

1421
02:00:55,033 --> 02:01:01,438
Unions are limited by their very nature of not having a full sight of view of the whole city's needs.

1422
02:01:02,239 --> 02:01:07,763
We as citizens have a say in what requirements we want our officers, police officers to have.

1423
02:01:08,923 --> 02:01:11,144
But don't think the public gets a pass either.

1424
02:01:11,624 --> 02:01:15,306
Our job is to make sure that police officers aren't afraid to do their jobs.

1425
02:01:16,286 --> 02:01:25,790
And if we continue to beat them up in the public eye and they fear being scapegoated for society's ills, they will not be there one day when you need them the most.

1426
02:01:27,150 --> 02:01:33,853
I propose that every officer be required to talk to a therapist out of the city limits who specializes in police stress once a month.

1427
02:01:34,688 --> 02:01:36,589
If you have a better idea, please let me know.

1428
02:01:37,749 --> 02:01:42,892
Only if everyone does it will those who ask for help not be stigmatized.

1429
02:01:44,193 --> 02:01:50,416
If it becomes routine, it will become a social norm and the guys won't pick on the minority of guys who go.

1430
02:01:52,537 --> 02:01:55,258
To my fellow citizens, this is not a wish list item.

1431
02:01:55,978 --> 02:01:57,159
This is a mandatory item.

1432
02:01:57,899 --> 02:02:01,061
You may offer a tweak here or there, but it needs to be done.

1433
02:02:01,901 --> 02:02:03,782
Police men and women cannot strike.

1434
02:02:04,293 --> 02:02:08,096
And that leaves them in a very bad place to be overworked and build up pressure.

1435
02:02:08,876 --> 02:02:13,599
Remember, when a police officer escalates, he or she does that in our name.

1436
02:02:14,100 --> 02:02:15,220
He or she works for us.

1437
02:02:15,841 --> 02:02:20,584
The unions need to do what is in the best interest for everyone, including the public they serve.

1438
02:02:21,144 --> 02:02:25,127
This is one measure that can help prevent police officers from blowing a gasket.

1439
02:02:25,847 --> 02:02:27,248
If you find another, let me know.

1440
02:02:28,929 --> 02:02:32,712
We, the public, need to see the danger in not doing our job.

1441
02:02:34,260 --> 02:02:36,722
which is to see that the needs of our police department are met.

1442
02:02:37,702 --> 02:02:40,944
Otherwise, the blood will be on our hands.

1443
02:02:42,205 --> 02:02:44,927
We only have 105 police officers for a city of 58,000.

1444
02:02:45,147 --> 02:02:47,509
They are a minority.

1445
02:02:48,229 --> 02:02:51,331
We need to hear them now, not tomorrow when it is too late.

1446
02:02:52,972 --> 02:03:02,038
We owe the police officers every opportunity to maintain his or her composure by looking after their health, both mental and physical.

1447
02:03:02,538 --> 02:03:03,759
And we also owe them a thank you.

1448
02:03:04,166 --> 02:03:05,907
for doing a job that we do not want to do.

1449
02:03:06,567 --> 02:03:06,887
Thank you.

1450
02:03:10,588 --> 02:03:11,188
Thank you, Jean.

1451
02:03:11,569 --> 02:03:13,409
Sir, please state your name and address for the record.

1452
02:03:13,589 --> 02:03:13,949
Thank you.

1453
02:03:14,089 --> 02:03:14,429
Welcome.

1454
02:03:15,130 --> 02:03:17,390
Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Avenue for Mass.

1455
02:03:17,410 --> 02:03:18,191
I want to thank Ms.

1456
02:03:18,231 --> 02:03:21,012
Martin for an excellent presentation.

1457
02:03:21,512 --> 02:03:25,293
Medford has to give something to the community if it is going to charge the community.

1458
02:03:25,773 --> 02:03:30,675
I would like to see the parking monies go to police, firefighter, and other infrastructure.

1459
02:03:32,128 --> 02:03:41,110
Instead of about two-thirds of it going south, literally, out there on the Chattanooga choo-choo, we need to keep the monies in Medford.

1460
02:03:41,630 --> 02:03:43,690
Now, this mayor does it with other things.

1461
02:03:44,310 --> 02:03:46,851
Public access monies, we can't find it, critical election.

1462
02:03:47,611 --> 02:03:48,031
Where is it?

1463
02:03:49,071 --> 02:04:00,873
The parking monies in Somerville, 25 cents for me to park there, or in Union Square, they have a little island, and in that island, they have the pay-to-park, and it's a lot simpler than in Medford.

1464
02:04:01,417 --> 02:04:04,758
You put in your charge card, you put in your, first you put in your space number.

1465
02:04:06,038 --> 02:04:08,799
I put up to three bucks in there and you get three hours, it's amazing.

1466
02:04:09,720 --> 02:04:15,181
That way I can do my radio show, and I can go to lunch, and I can go home and I don't have to worry.

1467
02:04:16,001 --> 02:04:21,643
If there are no metered parking, those kiosk things, then I can go to the 25 cent thing.

1468
02:04:21,683 --> 02:04:26,145
So I have plenty of quarters in my pocket when I go to Somerville.

1469
02:04:26,945 --> 02:04:27,725
But that's Somerville.

1470
02:04:27,765 --> 02:04:30,786
Medford's a little bit further out and we don't have the nightlife and the hotspot.

1471
02:04:31,842 --> 02:04:32,602
I'll keep it brief.

1472
02:04:34,083 --> 02:04:38,606
In Medford, we're paying for something, and the money's going south, but we don't get road repair first.

1473
02:04:39,166 --> 02:04:51,933
If the mayor had repaired the roads, given us something and said, you know, we gotta pay for this now, public hearing, let's talk about it, and he came out here and honestly and sincerely said, you know, people, we have a lot of broken roads, and it's on me, just like Chuck Pagano.

1474
02:04:52,433 --> 02:04:58,997
The mayor fumbled worse than Chuck Pagano the past Friday night with that debacle of the Indianapolis Colts.

1475
02:04:59,928 --> 02:05:00,909
The mayor fumbled worse.

1476
02:05:01,329 --> 02:05:05,291
He should have come here with hat in hand and said, I'm sorry, citizens, 28 years I haven't been there.

1477
02:05:05,872 --> 02:05:07,453
I've been at my golf turns, whatever.

1478
02:05:08,633 --> 02:05:12,796
Sir, this is the People's Forum, and this is very important.

1479
02:05:13,076 --> 02:05:24,563
Had the mayor given us clean, beautiful roads, like we deserve, then he could say, let's talk about parking, then we can pay for it, and then we know it's not because we're Somerville, because we're not.

1480
02:05:25,283 --> 02:05:27,825
It's because we finally paved the roads,

1481
02:05:28,963 --> 02:05:31,083
and finally have a city we can be proud of.

1482
02:05:37,084 --> 02:05:37,445
Welcome.

1483
02:05:37,465 --> 02:05:39,065
Please state your name and address for the record.

1484
02:05:39,565 --> 02:05:42,105
Name is Nick Thomas look 29 Garfield Avenue.

1485
02:05:43,166 --> 02:05:50,867
You know, I like to stop hearing about this policeman, you know, beating on the guy, beating on the guy and keep beating on the guy.

1486
02:05:51,407 --> 02:05:53,367
He's got citations and everything else.

1487
02:05:53,447 --> 02:05:54,948
So the guy retires.

1488
02:05:55,788 --> 02:05:56,568
But the thing of it is,

1489
02:05:57,361 --> 02:05:58,953
If that potty in that car...

1490
02:05:59,686 --> 02:06:00,366
was totally innocent.

1491
02:06:00,386 --> 02:06:01,587
Point of information, counsel.

1492
02:06:02,067 --> 02:06:02,887
Point of information.

1493
02:06:03,607 --> 02:06:07,949
Just for the record, because we're talking about an individual, there was no allegations of beating anyone up.

1494
02:06:08,329 --> 02:06:09,289
No, no, but I'm just saying.

1495
02:06:09,449 --> 02:06:10,269
No, no, I'm just saying.

1496
02:06:10,289 --> 02:06:13,910
I'm trying to make the point that this person was so innocent in this automobile.

1497
02:06:14,211 --> 02:06:17,232
I don't want you to get sued personally, so I'm looking elsewhere.

1498
02:06:17,252 --> 02:06:18,492
I don't know him personally.

1499
02:06:18,512 --> 02:06:18,972
No, no, no.

1500
02:06:18,992 --> 02:06:22,653
I'm talking about you saying he beat someone up, and then I could sue you.

1501
02:06:22,673 --> 02:06:22,853
No, no, no.

1502
02:06:22,893 --> 02:06:23,533
I didn't say.

1503
02:06:23,553 --> 02:06:24,894
Let's start beating on the subject.

1504
02:06:25,554 --> 02:06:26,054
Not on him.

1505
02:06:26,074 --> 02:06:26,614
Oh, OK.

1506
02:06:26,995 --> 02:06:27,775
On the subject.

1507
02:06:28,595 --> 02:06:29,215
No, no.

1508
02:06:30,136 --> 02:06:31,956
I have nothing to gain, nothing to lose here.

1509
02:06:32,876 --> 02:06:33,857
I just speak my mind.

1510
02:06:34,737 --> 02:06:42,379
But the thing of it is, if this guy in the car was so innocent, why didn't he release the whole tape instead of portions of it?

1511
02:06:43,400 --> 02:06:44,920
The portions that benefited him.

1512
02:06:47,101 --> 02:06:47,961
That's all I have to say.

1513
02:06:48,021 --> 02:06:48,401
Thank you.

1514
02:06:48,581 --> 02:06:49,142
Thank you very much.

1515
02:06:49,162 --> 02:06:52,763
It just aggravates me when I hear it because this guy's got a ton of citations.

1516
02:06:53,635 --> 02:07:01,078
It was a good car, and all of a sudden, you take small portions of a tape, and you crucify him on it.

1517
02:07:02,618 --> 02:07:03,338
It's going to stop.

1518
02:07:04,279 --> 02:07:05,659
Let's not even talk about it anymore.

1519
02:07:05,679 --> 02:07:06,839
The guy retired is gone.

1520
02:07:07,500 --> 02:07:07,880
Very good.

1521
02:07:08,340 --> 02:07:08,840
Then we won't.

1522
02:07:08,860 --> 02:07:09,100
Thank you.

1523
02:07:09,120 --> 02:07:13,222
So on the motion of Councilor Camuso to receive in place on file, all those?

1524
02:07:14,822 --> 02:07:16,103
On the motion, Councilor Penta.

1525
02:07:16,483 --> 02:07:20,024
I don't want to receive it in place on file, because we asked two months ago for an updated financial

1526
02:07:20,658 --> 02:07:26,321
uh, accounting of just where are we right now between the Republic parking and all the citations that have been dismissed.

1527
02:07:26,381 --> 02:07:27,341
We still haven't gotten it.

1528
02:07:27,862 --> 02:07:30,363
So I don't want to receive it, but I want to report back from the mayor.

1529
02:07:30,443 --> 02:07:50,313
Once again, this would be the second time we've asked in two months on the motion of council Penta, that a report be grant given to the, uh, city council, uh, on the revenue analysis of, uh, the present, uh, parking, uh, plan and all citations that were dismissed.

1530
02:07:50,932 --> 02:07:57,174
and on all citations that were dismissed that is sent to the mayor's office for action on that motion.

1531
02:07:57,194 --> 02:07:58,334
All those in favor?

1532
02:07:58,554 --> 02:07:59,274
All those opposed?

1533
02:08:00,035 --> 02:08:00,435
Passes.

1534
02:08:02,075 --> 02:08:05,636
We'll take a papers in the clerk, uh, hand of the city clerk.

1535
02:08:06,277 --> 02:08:17,840
Um, first one from council night, be it resolved that the Memphis city council hold a committee of the whole meeting for the purpose of discussing the city council appointee to the community garden commission counselor night.

1536
02:08:18,393 --> 02:08:20,074
Mr. President, thank you very much.

1537
02:08:20,255 --> 02:08:27,780
Just a few short weeks ago this council passed a community gardens commission ordinance and created a commission and the council has an appointee.

1538
02:08:28,821 --> 02:08:35,986
The administration has filled their three slots and there is one vacancy that remains and that is the vacancy that the city council is to appoint, Mr. President.

1539
02:08:36,006 --> 02:08:40,970
So I'd ask that we establish a committee of the whole meeting in short order so that we can

1540
02:08:41,737 --> 02:08:50,199
review the applicants and create maybe some criteria or parameters as to what we expect from them as the City Council appointee and then move to fill the vacancy.

1541
02:08:50,779 --> 02:08:51,100
Very good.

1542
02:08:51,240 --> 02:08:52,480
On that motion, all those in favor?

1543
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:53,640
All those opposed?

1544
02:08:54,380 --> 02:08:56,361
Granted, we'll call that meeting in the near term.

1545
02:08:56,881 --> 02:09:06,244
Be it resolved, this is also offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved the Medford Police Department forward a copy of its Narcan policy to the City Council.

1546
02:09:06,544 --> 02:09:07,084
Councilor Knight.

1547
02:09:07,644 --> 02:09:08,464
Yes, Mr. President.

1548
02:09:08,504 --> 02:09:10,945
Recently, very recently, our Medford Police Department

1549
02:09:11,446 --> 02:09:14,707
And its patrolmen have been fitted with Narcan kits, Mr. President.

1550
02:09:14,887 --> 02:09:18,369
And I'd like to know what the policy is in terms of when Narcan is appropriate.

1551
02:09:18,509 --> 02:09:26,652
And it's my understanding that they have been trained, that Strong Ambulance has donated some services to train our first responders for the use of Narcan.

1552
02:09:26,712 --> 02:09:30,094
And I'd just like to see what a copy of the policy looks like so that we can have it for our records.

1553
02:09:30,454 --> 02:09:32,094
On that motion, all those in favor?

1554
02:09:32,675 --> 02:09:33,335
All those opposed?

1555
02:09:33,395 --> 02:09:34,035
Motion carries.

1556
02:09:34,675 --> 02:09:41,038
Finally, offered by Councilor Langel-Kern, Madam Vice President, be it resolved that the revenue, I'm sorry, that the reverse

1557
02:09:41,602 --> 02:09:51,068
9-1-1 updates be looked into with regards to distinguishing between emergency notices and community updates for the interest of public safety?

1558
02:09:51,388 --> 02:09:52,328
Madam Vice President.

1559
02:09:52,548 --> 02:09:53,049
Very good.

1560
02:09:53,069 --> 02:09:54,409
Thank you, President De La Russo.

1561
02:09:55,310 --> 02:10:00,413
Within the last 30 to 45 days, it seems like we've been getting a reverse 9-1-1 call.

1562
02:10:00,693 --> 02:10:03,255
Once today, I think I received two.

1563
02:10:03,275 --> 02:10:06,877
A lot of them are great community updates.

1564
02:10:07,810 --> 02:10:12,013
Number one, I feel like some of them can be grouped together so you're not receiving so many.

1565
02:10:12,493 --> 02:10:18,997
But my main concern is with regards to just discussing it throughout the city.

1566
02:10:19,517 --> 02:10:21,499
People are starting to get a little aggravated.

1567
02:10:21,619 --> 02:10:27,783
Some have told me that they have made the effort to block the phone calls.

1568
02:10:27,923 --> 02:10:34,367
And some have mentioned that it's just getting so out of hand that they'd rather not get updates at all.

1569
02:10:35,144 --> 02:10:42,229
I don't know if we can distinguish, maybe look into distinguishing between people who want to get the community updates and the emergency updates.

1570
02:10:42,689 --> 02:10:51,955
And then also have a category where it's, you know, an emergency basis and people can opt in or opt out of each, you know, category.

1571
02:10:51,975 --> 02:10:56,058
I know that I've, people are telling me they're just hanging up.

1572
02:10:56,378 --> 02:10:59,020
They see the number and they just pick up and hang it up.

1573
02:10:59,400 --> 02:11:01,701
And that creates a public safety issue.

1574
02:11:01,742 --> 02:11:03,843
I mean, if we do have a true emergency,

1575
02:11:04,562 --> 02:11:09,485
and somebody's picking up the phone and hanging up the phone because they're so aggravated, they're getting the calls every single day.

1576
02:11:09,866 --> 02:11:11,147
What if we do have an emergency?

1577
02:11:11,187 --> 02:11:15,269
What if, you know, something really is, you know, we need to get it out to the residents?

1578
02:11:15,309 --> 02:11:29,119
So I think hopefully, you know, whoever's in control of it, the administration, obviously, Captain DiClemente, and the police department, if maybe we can delineate between the two categories, you know, community notices,

1579
02:11:29,620 --> 02:11:36,066
You know, it's great to hear about the road race and things that are on the council agenda and events that are happening on the weekends.

1580
02:11:37,727 --> 02:11:44,533
You know, I think, truly, I think I've received 15 in the last 14 days.

1581
02:11:44,613 --> 02:11:48,096
So I would just like to see if maybe that could be a possibility.

1582
02:11:48,156 --> 02:11:56,163
People can opt in to just get the emergency or opt in to get the emergency and the community updates for public safety purposes.

1583
02:11:56,752 --> 02:11:57,132
Very good.

1584
02:11:57,232 --> 02:11:58,772
So on that motion, all those in favor?

1585
02:11:59,293 --> 02:11:59,993
All those opposed?

1586
02:12:00,013 --> 02:12:00,473
Motion carries.

1587
02:12:01,653 --> 02:12:02,913
Thank you, Madam Vice President.

1588
02:12:04,954 --> 02:12:05,514
The records.

1589
02:12:08,675 --> 02:12:09,455
Councilor.

1590
02:12:09,635 --> 02:12:10,935
Just if I could, Mr. President.

1591
02:12:11,075 --> 02:12:13,576
I have an update on the dog park.

1592
02:12:14,576 --> 02:12:17,456
I know it was mentioned by Councilor Longo Kern.

1593
02:12:18,417 --> 02:12:24,678
Last night at the school committee meeting, we were invited by the school committee

1594
02:12:25,457 --> 02:12:45,294
And when I say we, it was Leonard Design Associates, who is the site planning and landscape architect for the dog park, along with Paws for Method, which was the committee that was created of a group of interested citizens in creating a dog park.

1595
02:12:46,155 --> 02:12:49,278
And we appeared before the school committee last night

1596
02:12:49,934 --> 02:12:58,696
to discuss the potential site for the dog park, which is Riverbend Park along the river.

1597
02:12:59,476 --> 02:13:04,398
And where it's on school property, we needed school committee approval.

1598
02:13:05,138 --> 02:13:11,980
And I'm pleased to announce that the school committee voted unanimously for approval of this particular park.

1599
02:13:12,960 --> 02:13:17,521
If anyone's interested in looking at the schematic presentation

1600
02:13:17,974 --> 02:13:25,638
that was presented last night, if you didn't catch the school committee, you can go on pause, the number four, medford.org.

1601
02:13:25,718 --> 02:13:38,405
So it's pause, the number four, medford.org, and you can also leave a name and email address on the site and you will be receiving updates of anything that goes on.

1602
02:13:38,425 --> 02:13:47,210
There's a timeline of the project and where the two particular parks, there's gonna be a small dog park

1603
02:13:48,322 --> 02:13:53,365
and a large dog park for larger dogs on the site itself.

1604
02:13:54,225 --> 02:14:05,271
A lot of time and effort went into this particular proposal from the Dog Park Advisory Committee, who created the website on their own, at their own expense.

1605
02:14:06,011 --> 02:14:14,876
The members of the committee are Patty Flynn, Jim Silva, Diane Gitner, Britt Fitch, Gary DeStefano, John Sardone, and myself.

1606
02:14:15,664 --> 02:14:31,668
and this group was established in November of last year, and to date, we have brought on board a landscape and site plan design person who put together this schematic presentation last night.

1607
02:14:32,188 --> 02:14:42,311
I asked the gentleman, along with the other committee members, to appear before the Memphis City Council in the next several weeks to give us the presentation, Mr. President.

1608
02:14:43,712 --> 02:14:45,132
Come this November,

1609
02:14:45,832 --> 02:14:53,336
The committee will be applying for a grant through the Stanton Group, which is a private foundation that funds dog parks.

1610
02:14:54,257 --> 02:14:59,540
They funded dog parks in Somerville and in Arlington at no expense to the taxpayers.

1611
02:15:00,781 --> 02:15:06,064
And they will also fund maintenance and upkeep for a period of time, too.

1612
02:15:06,704 --> 02:15:12,347
I believe it was in Arlington they funded, I think it was $20,000 for a three-year period for the upkeep.

1613
02:15:13,669 --> 02:15:16,270
This particular site is handicap accessible.

1614
02:15:16,670 --> 02:15:22,432
There's lighting in the area, so we don't have to have a great expense to add lighting to the site.

1615
02:15:23,132 --> 02:15:24,312
There's water in the area.

1616
02:15:24,332 --> 02:15:27,013
They're going to have obstacle courses for the dogs.

1617
02:15:27,974 --> 02:15:33,055
It's going to be a real great, great top-notch dog park in this community.

1618
02:15:33,816 --> 02:15:40,998
And we are projected for hopefully a grand opening sometime in maybe

1619
02:15:41,987 --> 02:15:46,351
July, August, September of next year, if everything goes well, Mr. President.

1620
02:15:46,371 --> 02:15:56,619
And that includes approval from the grant, the Stanton Group, and any other design things that need to be worked out.

1621
02:15:56,679 --> 02:16:04,086
But I just want to update the Council, and I will invite at a future meeting within the next several weeks for a PowerPoint presentation.

1622
02:16:04,686 --> 02:16:10,631
It's a rather short presentation, but it's really been a labor of love.

1623
02:16:11,050 --> 02:16:14,493
for many residents in this community and long overdue.

1624
02:16:15,034 --> 02:16:23,761
Uh, if we all recall the fast 14 bridge project that took place, the mayor negotiated as part of the mitigation $60,000 for the dog park.

1625
02:16:24,402 --> 02:16:32,929
And we are using some of that money now to bring on this Leonard design associates, uh, to pay for this initial schematic, uh, design that was done.

1626
02:16:33,430 --> 02:16:36,152
So, um, I look forward to this presentation.

1627
02:16:36,559 --> 02:16:38,100
in the next several weeks, Mr. President.

1628
02:16:38,180 --> 02:16:40,281
So do I. And thank you for that wonderful update.

1629
02:16:40,321 --> 02:16:44,563
Counselor on the motion, uh, Mr. President, we do have a resident.

1630
02:16:44,603 --> 02:16:54,068
If we could suspend the rules that would like to speak on the motion of council nine, uh, marks for the suspension of the rules.

1631
02:16:54,729 --> 02:16:57,450
All those in favor, all those opposed.

1632
02:16:59,331 --> 02:16:59,752
Good evening.

1633
02:16:59,812 --> 02:17:01,272
Please state your name and address for the record.

1634
02:17:01,573 --> 02:17:02,013
Good evening.

1635
02:17:02,033 --> 02:17:05,915
My name is Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Ave, Medford mass.

1636
02:17:06,802 --> 02:17:19,887
I just wanted to alert the citizens that we have something called Video on Demand on Comcast for every candidate out there that's running for election 13 days from now, 14 days from tonight, 13 days starting tomorrow.

1637
02:17:20,507 --> 02:17:24,809
Video on Demand is something that only six cities in the country have, Medford being one of them.

1638
02:17:25,569 --> 02:17:29,130
It's something to supplement public access when you don't have public access.

1639
02:17:29,650 --> 02:17:34,172
So the mayor, Mayor McGlynn himself said this will bring a new level of transparency

1640
02:17:35,186 --> 02:17:39,907
Now, I went to them and they promised me five broadcasts of, or cablecasts of visual radio.

1641
02:17:40,307 --> 02:17:46,928
They put my Rob Gronkowski up about a year and a half ago, and it was up for like three months, and then they refused to put up any more.

1642
02:17:47,308 --> 02:17:50,229
Now, I'm a citizen using this video on demand.

1643
02:17:50,269 --> 02:17:50,969
It's channel one.

1644
02:17:51,849 --> 02:17:53,270
I would love to see the debate on there.

1645
02:17:53,690 --> 02:17:55,510
I would love to see Stephanie Burke on there.

1646
02:17:55,570 --> 02:17:57,010
I would love to see Chris DeVita.

1647
02:17:58,551 --> 02:18:04,712
Any candidate that wants to put a video up should be able to put it on video on demand so that anyone getting Comcast

1648
02:18:05,150 --> 02:18:12,434
You can go to Channel One and watch these videos, because a lot of seniors do not have Internet access, and it's very important to know that.

1649
02:18:12,554 --> 02:18:18,516
A lot of seniors are on a tight budget, so they might get basic cable, or they might not.

1650
02:18:19,497 --> 02:18:23,619
But they might get basic cable where they don't get Internet.

1651
02:18:23,739 --> 02:18:28,681
So that's very, very important, and this is a resource that we have to use for this election.

1652
02:18:29,642 --> 02:18:29,982
Thank you.

1653
02:18:30,302 --> 02:18:30,682
Thank you.

1654
02:18:31,843 --> 02:18:33,524
The records of October 13th.

1655
02:18:37,610 --> 02:18:39,552
Thank you, President De La Russo.

1656
02:18:40,193 --> 02:18:49,141
We got an update from the Dominic Kamara, chair of the Water and Sewer Commission, with regards to the questions we asked regarding Brooks Estates.

1657
02:18:49,962 --> 02:18:55,768
And the commission has been recently told that the Brooks Estates does have a water meter.

1658
02:18:56,769 --> 02:18:58,751
The meter is very old.

1659
02:19:00,787 --> 02:19:04,728
The commission is not aware of any billing or abatements that may pertain to the Brooks Estate.

1660
02:19:04,969 --> 02:19:08,370
The commission has also been told that the Brooks Estate does not have a sewer line.

1661
02:19:09,170 --> 02:19:18,534
The billing department at City Hall would have pertinent information around this inquiry as it pertains to billing history or lack thereof.

1662
02:19:19,274 --> 02:19:21,655
So that was some of the questions we asked.

1663
02:19:22,335 --> 02:19:30,278
I just want to hopefully remind the president with regards to setting up a committee of the whole meeting with the Brooks Estate

1664
02:19:31,404 --> 02:19:47,736
commission, city solicitor, Karen Rose, that we can discuss, you know, moving forward with regards to not having tenants in the property or just discuss some ways we can maintain the grounds without a live-in.

1665
02:19:48,516 --> 02:19:53,580
So hopefully we can call that within the near future, you know, so we can prevent any future problems.

1666
02:19:53,980 --> 02:19:55,281
Thank you, Madam Vice-President.

1667
02:19:55,801 --> 02:19:56,942
The records of the previous

1668
02:19:58,607 --> 02:20:01,069
Councilor Knight, Mr. Councilor, how do you find those records?

1669
02:20:01,149 --> 02:20:02,470
I find the records in order, Mr. President.

1670
02:20:04,231 --> 02:20:04,832
Is there a motion?

1671
02:20:05,752 --> 02:20:06,873
There is a motion for approval.

1672
02:20:07,213 --> 02:20:10,156
On the motion for approval, the records of the October 13th meeting.

1673
02:20:10,176 --> 02:20:10,876
All those in favor?

1674
02:20:11,076 --> 02:20:11,397
Aye.

1675
02:20:12,237 --> 02:20:13,038
Motion carries.

1676
02:20:13,498 --> 02:20:16,240
Motion for approval, uh, adjournment.

1677
02:20:19,262 --> 02:20:26,608
I'd be remiss if I didn't mention, uh, the, uh, the Crystal Campbell dedication that took place, uh, on Sunday,

1678
02:20:27,602 --> 02:20:32,303
It was a real heartfelt event and well attended.

1679
02:20:32,864 --> 02:20:37,765
And the administration did a tremendous job putting this together, Mr. President.

1680
02:20:38,025 --> 02:20:48,568
And I just want to say it really put our city in a great light and is a real tribute to this community and how we honor our residents, Mr. President.

1681
02:20:50,970 --> 02:20:52,391
Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

1682
02:20:52,511 --> 02:20:57,115
Mr. President, I'm very pleased and proud to be one of the councilors that voted in support of that project.

1683
02:21:00,417 --> 02:21:02,739
A motion for adjournment by Vice President Langel-Kern.

1684
02:21:02,759 --> 02:21:03,440
All those in favor?

1685
02:21:03,680 --> 02:21:03,780
Aye.

1686
02:21:03,860 --> 02:21:04,420
Opposed?

1687
02:21:04,580 --> 02:21:05,141
Meeting adjourned.
