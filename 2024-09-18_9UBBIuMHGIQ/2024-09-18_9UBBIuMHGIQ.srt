00:00:33,879 --> 00:00:36,742
[SPEAKER_09]: 17 2024 Medford City Council, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2
00:01:03,177 --> 00:01:07,923
[SPEAKER_09]: Announcements, accolades, remembrances, reports and records 24469 offered by Councilor Tseng.

3
00:01:07,963 --> 00:01:17,714
[SPEAKER_09]: Be it resolved that the City Council celebrate the importance of the Chevalier Theatre and commend the friends of Chevalier and Dream Act Gym for their hard work in securing, ensuring the success of the theatre, Councilor Tseng.

4
00:01:18,055 --> 00:01:18,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.

5
00:01:19,356 --> 00:01:22,139
[SPEAKER_04]: In many ways, the Chevalier is the life blood

6
00:01:23,841 --> 00:01:24,722
[SPEAKER_04]: of Medford Square.

7
00:01:24,742 --> 00:01:26,484
[SPEAKER_04]: It is the beating heart of our square.

8
00:01:27,485 --> 00:01:37,013
[SPEAKER_04]: We see when on nights where there are shows at the Chevalier, how many people come into Medford Square, frequent our businesses, frequent our up-and-coming bars seen here as well.

9
00:01:38,715 --> 00:01:45,260
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, you know, it's easy to see that success and see something that we're so proud of and, you know,

10
00:01:46,181 --> 00:01:49,044
[SPEAKER_04]: forget about all the hard work that goes into making it what it is.

11
00:01:49,104 --> 00:01:59,734
[SPEAKER_04]: We heard last week about a little bit about a lot of the hard work that volunteers have put in to making sure this Chevalier runs the way it does.

12
00:02:00,976 --> 00:02:02,437
[SPEAKER_04]: And we heard a little bit

13
00:02:03,018 --> 00:02:17,055
[SPEAKER_04]: a tiny glimpse into some of the other work being done by the Friends of Chivalry Theater and Gene Knack Gym, including youth programming and using the old high school gym to provide, you know, much needed after school care in the city.

14
00:02:18,076 --> 00:02:19,357
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to be, you know, I don't want

15
00:02:20,038 --> 00:02:38,363
[SPEAKER_04]: beat the horse around because we have a very special guest in the audience, who I am sure can tell you and tell our residents so much more about the Chevalier Theatre and all the work that the Friends of the Chevalier Theatre do, and to present it much more eloquently than I can.

16
00:02:38,383 --> 00:02:42,984
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further questions or statements from members of the Council?

17
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:46,105
[SPEAKER_10]: Seeing none, I will recognize Mr. Krause.

18
00:02:46,305 --> 00:02:46,825
[SPEAKER_10]: Ken, how are you?

19
00:02:48,302 --> 00:02:49,483
[SPEAKER_10]: Name and address for the record, please.

20
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:50,163
[SPEAKER_10]: You have three minutes.

21
00:03:07,614 --> 00:03:08,735
[SPEAKER_06]: Ken, can you turn the mic on?

22
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:11,977
[SPEAKER_19]: Is that better?

23
00:03:13,258 --> 00:03:14,839
[SPEAKER_19]: Is that green lights on now?

24
00:03:15,942 --> 00:03:24,607
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, sorry, Ken Krause, 50 Mystic Street, board member of the Friends of Chevalier and GMAC Gym and the Chevalier Theatre Organ Society.

25
00:03:24,627 --> 00:03:31,811
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you for the resolution, Councilor Sagan, for your interest and attention last week when Cindy Watson from the Friends addressed you.

26
00:03:32,132 --> 00:03:38,175
[SPEAKER_19]: I just wanted to offer a little bit more information, a brief history about Chevalier Complex.

27
00:03:38,275 --> 00:03:42,858
[SPEAKER_19]: It was built in 1939 as a WPA project as an addition to Medford High School.

28
00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:57,110
[SPEAKER_19]: It served the school well until 1965 when there was a major fire and most of the fire was contained in the northwest end of the complex, the gym and the theater on the south end.

29
00:03:57,791 --> 00:04:00,954
[SPEAKER_19]: But at that point, the city decided to build a new high school in 1970 and sell off the

30
00:04:03,656 --> 00:04:05,597
[SPEAKER_19]: part of the school that was salvageable.

31
00:04:06,198 --> 00:04:19,485
[SPEAKER_19]: When that was proposed, the Gene Mack Gym and the Shibari Theater were part of the sale, and citizens came before the council and persuaded them to sever the sale of the theater and the gym at that time.

32
00:04:20,606 --> 00:04:28,977
[SPEAKER_19]: In its wisdom, the city saved it, but unfortunately for the next 20 years or so, it was sort of abandoned and neglected and fell into serious disrepair.

33
00:04:29,698 --> 00:04:37,548
[SPEAKER_19]: So in the mid 80s, the city leaders and the Chevalier Commission was established, the Mystic Players, a low-refuted troop group,

34
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:46,513
[SPEAKER_19]: and the Friends of Chevalier all rallied together to get the theater and the gym rehab so they could both open in the early 1990s.

35
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:56,619
[SPEAKER_19]: It continued to languish and more or less used occasionally, particularly on the theater side, until seven years ago when the city hired Bill Blumenreich Presents to

36
00:04:57,259 --> 00:05:05,466
[SPEAKER_19]: manage and operate and book the theater on a regular basis, and we've seen the results of that relationship since.

37
00:05:06,427 --> 00:05:09,970
[SPEAKER_19]: The number of shows at the theater right now averages about 80.

38
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:17,097
[SPEAKER_19]: The year before Bill Blumenreich took over, there were 13, and three of those were in the on-stage series, which only used

39
00:05:17,597 --> 00:05:19,719
[SPEAKER_19]: the stage for the performers and the audience.

40
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,922
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's been a really successful partnership.

41
00:05:22,962 --> 00:05:31,670
[SPEAKER_19]: Also in 2019, the Metro Recreation Center, the department moved into the gym and their operations are amazing.

42
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:37,075
[SPEAKER_19]: If you look at their programming on their website, they offer everything from sensory art to archery for

43
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:39,436
[SPEAKER_19]: all ages and all abilities, seven days a week.

44
00:05:39,816 --> 00:05:42,377
[SPEAKER_19]: So Kevin Bailey and his team are doing a fabulous job.

45
00:05:42,497 --> 00:05:51,359
[SPEAKER_19]: And then the Medford Youth Center operation, which is primarily an afterschool and summer camp program, is run by the Mystic Valley YMCA for the city.

46
00:05:51,619 --> 00:06:00,242
[SPEAKER_19]: And they serve 100 kids a day, Medford youth, a day after school, and they do a terrific job there as well.

47
00:06:00,542 --> 00:06:05,503
[SPEAKER_19]: Sometimes there's misconceptions about what's going on in the building, so I just wanted to offer that.

48
00:06:05,523 --> 00:06:06,804
[SPEAKER_19]: Ken, you have about 30 seconds.

49
00:06:07,324 --> 00:06:19,671
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, so as Cindy pointed out, we have a great asset here and I appreciate the council's support and recognition of it as we continue to improve it.

50
00:06:19,731 --> 00:06:22,913
[SPEAKER_19]: There are some improvements that are underway that you'll see soon.

51
00:06:23,513 --> 00:06:30,217
[SPEAKER_19]: And for anybody else who might be interested, Mystic River celebration this Saturday, both the friends and the Oregon Society will have a table there.

52
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:36,221
[SPEAKER_19]: So if anybody's gonna attend, that's noon to four at the continent show, please stop by and talk to us and get some more information.

53
00:06:36,781 --> 00:06:37,102
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

54
00:06:37,703 --> 00:06:38,263
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Ken.

55
00:06:38,283 --> 00:06:40,707
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further questions or comments by members of the council?

56
00:06:43,211 --> 00:06:44,373
[SPEAKER_09]: Council Vice President Collins.

57
00:06:45,543 --> 00:06:46,323
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, President Bears.

58
00:06:46,723 --> 00:07:11,133
[SPEAKER_17]: Ken, just want to thank you so much for once again coming before the council to, you know, for folks who don't already know some of that history and context about the Chevalier, and for folks who know a little bit, maybe know it as an event venue, but haven't interfaced with what a community center it is and how much good it provides, not just as an entertainment center in Medford Square, but as a historic piece of property that's utilized by so many types of people.

59
00:07:12,153 --> 00:07:13,314
[SPEAKER_17]: in our community with our neighbors.

60
00:07:13,794 --> 00:07:17,295
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's always great to shine a spotlight on that, and thank you so much for your work.

61
00:07:18,995 --> 00:07:19,895
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Vice President Collins.

62
00:07:19,935 --> 00:07:21,596
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion of Councilor Tseng seconded by.

63
00:07:21,616 --> 00:07:23,617
[SPEAKER_09]: Seconded by Vice President Collins.

64
00:07:23,637 --> 00:07:24,717
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

65
00:07:27,658 --> 00:07:27,898
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

66
00:07:28,078 --> 00:07:28,278
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

67
00:07:28,678 --> 00:07:28,838
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

68
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:40,979
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

69
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,181
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I mean, from what I've read, negative, the motion passes.

70
00:07:44,241 --> 00:07:46,242
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Tseng offered a resolution under suspension.

71
00:07:46,302 --> 00:07:47,463
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a motion to suspend the rules?

72
00:07:48,644 --> 00:07:55,367
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion of Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Calderon to suspend the rules to take paper 24471, offered under suspension by Councilor Tseng.

73
00:07:55,387 --> 00:07:56,568
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll. 24471.

74
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:08,604
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

75
00:08:08,644 --> 00:08:08,764
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

76
00:08:08,785 --> 00:08:08,945
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

77
00:08:09,005 --> 00:08:09,165
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

78
00:08:19,536 --> 00:08:21,737
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Tseng? President Bears??

79
00:08:21,777 --> 00:08:21,878
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

80
00:08:21,898 --> 00:08:22,318
[SPEAKER_09]: President Fierce?

81
00:08:22,338 --> 00:08:22,498
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

82
00:08:22,558 --> 00:08:23,558
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a negative.

83
00:08:23,578 --> 00:08:24,499
[SPEAKER_09]: The motion passes.

84
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:26,500
[SPEAKER_09]: 24471 offered under suspension by Councilor Tseng.

85
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:34,884
[SPEAKER_09]: Be it resolved that the City of Medford stands in unconditional support of our Haitian brothers and sisters and of all immigrants who are part of this community wherever they may come from.

86
00:08:35,364 --> 00:08:43,909
[SPEAKER_09]: We are grateful for the skills, energy, and vibrancy they bring to Medford at this time when hateful and divisive rhetoric is being promulgated by highly visible people on the national level

87
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:49,036
[SPEAKER_09]: we believe that it is important to restate our commitment to all residents in our city, all residents of our city.

88
00:08:49,176 --> 00:08:49,777
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Tseng.

89
00:08:50,138 --> 00:08:50,558
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

90
00:08:51,459 --> 00:08:53,542
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, this is such a grave matter.

91
00:08:55,404 --> 00:09:18,807
[SPEAKER_04]: facing, you know, I think this is one of the examples where something national can really have local impacts on the national conversation that we've been having about immigration about race about, you know, about acceptance and inclusion does have local results and we see that in Springfield, Ohio, and you know, well Springfield, Ohio is not meant for Massachusetts.

92
00:09:19,468 --> 00:09:29,757
[SPEAKER_04]: The lessons that Springfield imports to us, I think, are real lessons for Medford and a real wake-up call for municipalities around the country.

93
00:09:30,858 --> 00:09:41,807
[SPEAKER_04]: There's been really wild, extreme accusations being launched against Haitian migrants who've moved to Ohio

94
00:09:43,468 --> 00:09:53,933
[SPEAKER_04]: who've moved to Springfield, Ohio, in search of work and a life away from, you know, difficult and dangerous living situations back in Haiti.

95
00:09:54,653 --> 00:09:59,755
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a story I think that Haitian Americans here in Medford relate to and know a lot about.

96
00:10:00,996 --> 00:10:02,297
[SPEAKER_04]: And what's been said has

97
00:10:03,197 --> 00:10:11,440
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the accusations being launched have been really difficult and led to really dangerous outcomes for people just trying to live a normal life in the ground.

98
00:10:12,661 --> 00:10:23,725
[SPEAKER_04]: We've seen that schools have been canceled because of bomb threats and because of threats against Haitian students, against kindergartners trying to go to picture day.

99
00:10:24,365 --> 00:10:43,033
[SPEAKER_04]: We've seen the windows of cars, of homes of Haitian immigrants in Ohio being smashed, and we've seen both the dangerous rhetoric but dangerous results spread outside of Ohio as well.

100
00:10:47,096 --> 00:10:49,217
[SPEAKER_04]: The Haitian community is so important to Medford.

101
00:10:49,237 --> 00:10:50,677
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so important to all of us.

102
00:10:52,378 --> 00:10:54,518
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't imagine our city without that.

103
00:10:54,658 --> 00:11:03,521
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think this is, the last few weeks have been a particularly difficult time for Haitian Americans and Haitian Medford residents as well.

104
00:11:03,842 --> 00:11:07,283
[SPEAKER_04]: And I wanted them to know that we stand with them as well.

105
00:11:07,623 --> 00:11:13,065
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a difficult subject for me to speak about because the racist tropes that have been peddled

106
00:11:15,202 --> 00:11:18,966
[SPEAKER_04]: which I don't want to repeat, have been things that I've heard growing up here as well.

107
00:11:19,326 --> 00:11:37,686
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, to people, it might seem like a joke, and it might seem like, you know, something that they've heard from someone else before, or something that just seems funny to say about someone, but I think this serves as a constant reminder that jokes and insensitive rhetoric can lead to real

108
00:11:38,366 --> 00:11:45,087
[SPEAKER_04]: threats to personal safety, to people just trying to live their everyday life, to contribute to our society, to give to our country.

109
00:11:45,667 --> 00:11:49,528
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's important for us to stand up for all of our residents.

110
00:11:51,408 --> 00:11:52,388
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

111
00:11:52,408 --> 00:11:54,089
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Lazzaro, Vice President Collins.

112
00:11:55,689 --> 00:11:58,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng, for bringing this forward.

113
00:11:58,529 --> 00:12:00,090
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't agree with you more.

114
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:04,510
[SPEAKER_03]: The Haitian community in Medford is so critical.

115
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:06,011
[SPEAKER_03]: And when that was said by

116
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:10,190
[SPEAKER_03]: candidate for president of the country.

117
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:22,038
[SPEAKER_03]: It was so, it really hits home in Medford to me because so many of our friends here are Haitian American.

118
00:12:22,058 --> 00:12:26,822
[SPEAKER_03]: The people that come to America from Haiti are here legally.

119
00:12:26,982 --> 00:12:37,630
[SPEAKER_03]: They're, not that there's whatever, but it's like something that I learned when I worked for the superintendent who is Haitian American herself.

120
00:12:38,226 --> 00:12:40,847
[SPEAKER_03]: and grew up in Medford and his family still lives in Medford.

121
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:54,631
[SPEAKER_03]: And she told me that the most common languages that we need translation services for are Portuguese for our Brazilian American folks.

122
00:12:54,931 --> 00:13:00,253
[SPEAKER_03]: And the second most common is Haitian Creole, not French, it's the Haitian dialect.

123
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,913
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it's Arabic, and then it's Spanish.

124
00:13:04,835 --> 00:13:12,144
[SPEAKER_03]: It was very interesting to me, and those were the people that we were hiring to do translation services for people that could translate to those languages.

125
00:13:13,342 --> 00:13:15,364
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a very big population in Medford.

126
00:13:16,164 --> 00:13:22,508
[SPEAKER_03]: My daughter's best friend when she was in daycare and pre-K was a little girl who was Haitian American.

127
00:13:23,048 --> 00:13:28,111
[SPEAKER_03]: My husband plays in a 90s cover band with a Haitian guy.

128
00:13:28,251 --> 00:13:37,897
[SPEAKER_03]: We are like, one of the best restaurants in Medford is a Haitian restaurant called the Neighborhood Restaurant, which if you haven't been there is amazing.

129
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:41,939
[SPEAKER_03]: They catered our Juneteenth celebration here in City Hall.

130
00:13:42,691 --> 00:13:44,112
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was really good.

131
00:13:44,272 --> 00:13:46,073
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is the fabric.

132
00:13:46,413 --> 00:13:50,515
[SPEAKER_03]: The Haitian community is part of what makes Medford unique and special.

133
00:13:51,035 --> 00:14:00,119
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just think that the support that we can show to a community that might be feeling upset now is important.

134
00:14:00,499 --> 00:14:02,080
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you for bringing this forward.

135
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:10,924
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's important that we just say out loud that this is not accurate or true and we voice our support.

136
00:14:13,899 --> 00:14:15,379
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Vice President Collins.

137
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:19,441
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, President Bears, Councilor Tseng, thank you so much for bringing this forward.

138
00:14:19,461 --> 00:14:35,585
[SPEAKER_17]: As time goes on, it seems to me, I notice in lots of ways how much easier it is to be destructive than it is to be constructive or to do good or proactive things.

139
00:14:37,745 --> 00:14:52,930
[SPEAKER_17]: case in point, you know, we have this hateful, divisive, self-serving, disgusting language, especially when it's propagated by national figures, that can very rapidly escalate to real harm against real people.

140
00:14:53,911 --> 00:14:58,772
[SPEAKER_17]: It is much easier to say something horrible to

141
00:15:01,894 --> 00:15:22,173
[SPEAKER_17]: trump up feelings in your base to achieve some kind of political ends than it is to use words to cultivate a society where people really are welcomed, really are supported, really are brought together, so easy to be divisive, so hard to cultivate genuine and true inclusivity.

142
00:15:22,293 --> 00:15:23,874
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think we see that in lots of ways.

143
00:15:24,555 --> 00:15:25,356
[SPEAKER_17]: But all that being said,

144
00:15:25,996 --> 00:15:37,209
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it is still really important for bodies such as ours to try to counter that negative, hateful rhetoric with positive rhetoric whenever we can at every opportunity.

145
00:15:37,409 --> 00:15:40,112
[SPEAKER_17]: Often it's in reaction to something that should never have been spoken.

146
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:45,278
[SPEAKER_17]: So I thank you for the opportunity for us to affirm as a city council, one,

147
00:15:46,599 --> 00:16:00,250
[SPEAKER_17]: unequivocally condemning this incident that happened in Ohio and the harm that was caused and those who sought to enrich themselves politically because of it and to stand with people who are affected by that.

148
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:08,937
[SPEAKER_17]: And also to affirm here in Medford, whether you were born here or not born here or not born in this country, you're part of this community.

149
00:16:09,318 --> 00:16:10,379
[SPEAKER_17]: We're so glad you're here.

150
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,701
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's stay together.

151
00:16:13,081 --> 00:16:13,802
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for being here.

152
00:16:14,342 --> 00:16:15,443
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for the opportunity.

153
00:16:19,586 --> 00:16:28,169
[SPEAKER_04]: I just realized that we actually submitted this together, and I was wondering if we could get Vice President Collins' name added to this resolution as well.

154
00:16:28,429 --> 00:16:32,110
[SPEAKER_09]: As a friendly amendment, no need for a roll call.

155
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:32,570
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

156
00:16:33,831 --> 00:16:34,051
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

157
00:16:34,111 --> 00:16:35,711
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further discussion by members of the Council?

158
00:16:37,352 --> 00:16:39,832
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll go to the podium for public participation.

159
00:16:39,852 --> 00:16:41,113
[SPEAKER_09]: Name and address for the record, please.

160
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:41,853
[SPEAKER_09]: You have three minutes.

161
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:44,850
[SPEAKER_12]: My name is Ellen Epstein.

162
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:47,171
[SPEAKER_12]: I live at 15 Grove Street.

163
00:16:47,791 --> 00:17:01,414
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just want to say I'm really proud, once again, of this city council that you've taken the initiative to not waste any time and issue this statement in support.

164
00:17:02,714 --> 00:17:10,496
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd also just like to go on the record saying that I hope that Mayor Briana will also go on record with a statement of her own.

165
00:17:11,536 --> 00:17:11,896
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

166
00:17:13,183 --> 00:17:13,664
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

167
00:17:14,365 --> 00:17:15,987
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further comment by members of the public?

168
00:17:16,107 --> 00:17:18,810
[SPEAKER_09]: I will go to Zoom, Eileen Lerner, and then we'll come back to the podium.

169
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:27,581
[SPEAKER_09]: Eileen, I've pressed the ask to unmute button.

170
00:17:27,822 --> 00:17:31,046
[SPEAKER_09]: If you can accept my invitation to unmute.

171
00:17:45,322 --> 00:17:46,764
[SPEAKER_09]: I've requested that you unmute, Eileen.

172
00:17:46,784 --> 00:17:47,945
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to have to press a button.

173
00:17:48,065 --> 00:17:49,847
[SPEAKER_09]: It should show up as a pop-up.

174
00:17:49,927 --> 00:18:01,420
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, Eileen, we'll come back to you.

175
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,241
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll go to the podium.

176
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:03,563
[SPEAKER_09]: Name and address for the record, please.

177
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:04,404
[SPEAKER_09]: You have three minutes.

178
00:18:11,377 --> 00:18:13,938
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say thank you for bringing up this subject.

179
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:22,162
[SPEAKER_00]: We are a nation of immigrants, and it's made us, created a great country once upon a time in the USA.

180
00:18:24,323 --> 00:18:32,467
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand, it would be best if the immigration was legal so the country could absorb it financially and logistically.

181
00:18:36,004 --> 00:18:40,828
[SPEAKER_00]: and make sense, and hopefully they will assimilate into our ways.

182
00:18:41,068 --> 00:18:42,049
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for listening.

183
00:18:45,392 --> 00:18:45,872
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

184
00:18:45,892 --> 00:18:48,815
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll go to Eileen Lerner on Zoom.

185
00:18:48,835 --> 00:18:50,276
[SPEAKER_09]: Name and address for the record, please.

186
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:51,337
[SPEAKER_09]: You have three minutes.

187
00:18:52,978 --> 00:18:58,083
[SPEAKER_13]: My name is Eileen Lerner, and I live at 9 Adams Circle in Medford.

188
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:22,787
[SPEAKER_13]: I wanted to say like the previous speaker that I'm so happy that this city council has chosen to speak out about things that are going on in the national arena, but nevertheless affect each and every one of us here in Medford.

189
00:19:22,807 --> 00:19:27,468
[SPEAKER_13]: And I feel as you do that I wanna reach out

190
00:19:28,226 --> 00:19:39,055
[SPEAKER_13]: to the Haitian-Americans in our community and say, we love you, we feel you, and we can't stand what's happening in this country.

191
00:19:39,195 --> 00:19:50,544
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think it would be great if the city would have an event, an event called Haitian American Appreciation Day.

192
00:19:52,006 --> 00:19:56,249
[SPEAKER_13]: And all the communities in Medford, religious communities,

193
00:19:58,692 --> 00:20:15,729
[SPEAKER_13]: language communities, any artistic communities come out together to tell the Haitian Americans how much we appreciate their hard, hard work that they have contributed to this country

194
00:20:17,153 --> 00:20:23,297
[SPEAKER_13]: that I've seen in my lifetime, because when I was young, I didn't know any Haitian Americans.

195
00:20:23,978 --> 00:20:31,363
[SPEAKER_13]: And boy, what a difference they have made or the energy and the intelligence that they have brought to this country.

196
00:20:32,084 --> 00:20:35,146
[SPEAKER_13]: And the narrative that we're hearing is just

197
00:20:36,331 --> 00:20:38,913
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just reprehensible and evil.

198
00:20:39,053 --> 00:21:04,669
[SPEAKER_13]: And I feel like I want us all to come out on the banks of the Mystic River or some other site, maybe at the Brooks House, at the Brooks Estate, and have a big party and eat together and sing together and be together and love each other and be an example in a world where people are trying to make us hate each other.

199
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:07,753
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

200
00:21:09,175 --> 00:21:09,675
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

201
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:14,382
[SPEAKER_09]: Name and address for the record, please.

202
00:21:14,402 --> 00:21:15,624
[SPEAKER_09]: At the podium, you have three minutes.

203
00:21:19,329 --> 00:21:21,032
[SPEAKER_14]: Lynn Weiss, 40 Greenleaf Avenue.

204
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:33,271
[SPEAKER_14]: In response to an earlier comment, I just wanna underline what Councilor Lazzaro said, which is that Haitian immigrants are here legally under temporary protective status.

205
00:21:34,572 --> 00:21:46,755
[SPEAKER_14]: It doesn't mean that we can't ensure that undocumented people don't receive decent treatment as well, but in the case of Haitian people, they are legally here.

206
00:21:49,324 --> 00:22:00,015
[SPEAKER_14]: I also recently found out that Medford has the 10th largest proportionally Haitian people in our community.

207
00:22:00,075 --> 00:22:04,080
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think it's really important that we're approving the statement.

208
00:22:04,941 --> 00:22:10,867
[SPEAKER_14]: And also our neighboring cities of Everett and Malden have even higher proportions of

209
00:22:11,824 --> 00:22:13,366
[SPEAKER_14]: Haitian people in their community.

210
00:22:13,426 --> 00:22:28,885
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think this is something that affects our city and hopefully we can work with other neighboring communities to make sure that people do not suffer because of the stupidity of some of our leaders.

211
00:22:30,387 --> 00:22:30,747
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

212
00:22:32,245 --> 00:22:40,671
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would also note that the city annually hosts a Haitian Flag Day ceremony, and I remember even in my time at Medford High School that that was a day of celebration in our schools.

213
00:22:42,712 --> 00:22:47,535
[SPEAKER_09]: And obviously there's always more that we can do, but I just wanted to note that that is a regular city event every year.

214
00:22:48,696 --> 00:22:51,878
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further comment by members of the council or the public on this matter?

215
00:22:54,459 --> 00:23:00,363
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing none, on the motion of Vice President Collins to approve as amended, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro.

216
00:23:00,443 --> 00:23:01,324

00:23:19,046 --> 00:23:20,206
[SPEAKER_09]: The motion passes.

00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:23,767

227
00:23:23,787 --> 00:23:24,808
[SPEAKER_09]: How did you find those records?

228
00:23:25,388 --> 00:23:27,348
[SPEAKER_03]: I found them in order and motion to approve.

229
00:23:27,608 --> 00:23:33,390
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion of Council Lazzaro to approve the record, seconded by Councilor Tseng, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, President Bears.

248
00:24:05,128 --> 00:24:14,712
[SPEAKER_17]: At the Planning and Permitting Committee meeting last week, the topic that we discussed with our zoning consultant was green score and incentive zoning.

249
00:24:14,732 --> 00:24:17,253
[SPEAKER_17]: This was kind of a preliminary discussion on both of those topics.

250
00:24:17,673 --> 00:24:21,915
[SPEAKER_17]: And so we will be meeting about them again before we take any votes.

251
00:24:22,815 --> 00:24:23,415

[SPEAKER_09]: Refer to committee for further discussion.

272

[SPEAKER_09]: 24-468 offered by Councilor Tseng be it resolved by the Medford City Council that the governance committee discuss updates to the city charter, including creating a timeline for action and reviewing proposals of the charter study committee once finalized.

273
00:24:59,248 --> 00:24:59,768
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Tseng.

274
00:25:00,213 --> 00:25:00,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.

275
00:25:00,974 --> 00:25:07,300
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to review is one of those topics that has been a great excitement in our community.

276
00:25:07,941 --> 00:25:17,271
[SPEAKER_04]: I know there are lots of folks who are very interested in talking about improving our electoral system improving the balance between different branches of our government.

277
00:25:18,832 --> 00:25:20,873
[SPEAKER_04]: and talking about how we can modernize our city.

278
00:25:21,713 --> 00:25:38,497
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that this is a chance to take a wonderful step forward in moving our city forward and to modernize our institutions to make sure that they're more responsive, that they're more representative of our city and more cooperative, that everyone is acting more cooperatively with each other.

279
00:25:40,077 --> 00:25:43,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Now the charter really underlies everything we do as a city.

280
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,461
[SPEAKER_04]: It's essentially our mini constitution.

281
00:25:46,061 --> 00:25:54,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and so the process of updating our charter, um, as people who have been really interested now has taken a while.

282
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:56,268
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's not, that's not a bad thing.

283
00:25:56,308 --> 00:26:03,893
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a natural, natural step when it comes to such a big project, but this is, uh, we're getting close to when the city council has to act on it.

284
00:26:04,053 --> 00:26:09,677
[SPEAKER_04]: And so as a chair of the governance committee, I wanted to put this on the agenda to make sure that we're getting a head start on it.

285
00:26:10,617 --> 00:26:20,262
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I wanted to lay out a very brief plan right now and then to talk more at the Governance Committee meeting about how we can approach it.

286
00:26:21,142 --> 00:26:35,870
[SPEAKER_04]: And so essentially I want to give the Governance Committee time to review the recommendations from the Charter Study Committee, as well as give us time to have even more community conversations about the proposals that are really going to shape up

287
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:47,018
[SPEAKER_04]: really shake up the city and to also give Councilors enough time to contemplate what we're voting on before something theoretically could pass the city council.

288
00:26:48,179 --> 00:27:01,610
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to plan to meet soon this month to form a timeline and to look big picture wise at a 30,000 foot view at what charter review is to give the public and our Councilors a chance to

289
00:27:02,751 --> 00:27:08,897
[SPEAKER_04]: be introduced to this topic and to get everyone up to speed with the basics of the conversations we might be having going forward.

290
00:27:08,998 --> 00:27:15,845
[SPEAKER_04]: So what questions might we be answering with charter review or what questions might we be asking and trying to answer.

291
00:27:17,407 --> 00:27:18,608
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to make sure that we're

292
00:27:19,798 --> 00:27:26,183
[SPEAKER_04]: moving forward in a cooperative spirit with members of the charter study commission committee and to invite them to meetings as well.

293
00:27:26,803 --> 00:27:37,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and all of this will take time, but I believe our city council can do really good work on this and be very responsive to the needs of our city and of our residents.

294
00:27:37,331 --> 00:27:47,718
[SPEAKER_09]: So I motion to move this to, um, the governance committee motion of Councilor Tseng to refer this to the governance committee, seconded by councilor Callahan, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

295
00:27:49,073 --> 00:27:49,193
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

296
00:27:49,213 --> 00:27:49,313
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

297
00:27:49,333 --> 00:27:49,473
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

298
00:27:49,513 --> 00:27:49,653
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

299
00:27:49,673 --> 00:27:49,874
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

300
00:27:51,054 --> 00:27:51,215
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

301
00:27:51,235 --> 00:27:51,355
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

302
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:16,072
[SPEAKER_09]: legal notice, sorry, 24439, legal notice, Medford City Clerk's Office continued notice of a public hearing.

303
00:28:16,092 --> 00:28:27,577
[SPEAKER_09]: The Medford City Council will hold a public hearing in the Howard F. Alden Chambers on the second floor of Medford City Hall, 85 George P. Hassett Drive, Medford MA, and by Zoom on Tuesday, September 10th, 2024 at 7 p.m.

304
00:28:27,737 --> 00:28:29,758
[SPEAKER_09]: A link to be posted no later than Friday, September 6th, 2024

305
00:28:31,158 --> 00:28:37,320
[SPEAKER_09]: On a petition for a special permit for hours filed by Panda Express, 491 Riverside Avenue, Medford MA 02155.

306
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:43,683
[SPEAKER_09]: The petitioner is seeking to extend the hours of operation of the restaurant in a commercial C1 zoning district at 4091 Riverside Avenue, parcel ID Q1511.

307
00:28:47,045 --> 00:28:53,648
[SPEAKER_09]: The petition seeks a special permit for hours, Monday through Sunday, and actually, there's an amendment, so I'm going to read the revised request now.

308
00:28:54,428 --> 00:29:01,132
[SPEAKER_09]: Panda Express, revised request, we request an extended hour special permit to operate until 12 a.m., Monday through Thursday, and 1 a.m.

309
00:29:01,252 --> 00:29:02,532
[SPEAKER_09]: on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.

310
00:29:03,093 --> 00:29:08,595
[SPEAKER_09]: This is in line with extended hour special permits recently granted to Great American Beer Hall, Snappy Patty's, and Pinky's Pizza.

311
00:29:09,055 --> 00:29:14,558
[SPEAKER_09]: We believe the disruption to the neighborhood from these extended hours will be minimal, because we are mostly surrounded by businesses and do not have a drive-through,

312
00:29:15,018 --> 00:29:18,902
[SPEAKER_09]: but a set of ample parking for visitors and food delivery drivers to park and come inside.

313
00:29:18,942 --> 00:29:22,485
[SPEAKER_09]: We look forward to working with the council to develop a plan that works for the neighborhood.

314
00:29:23,245 --> 00:29:31,613
[SPEAKER_09]: The petition and plan may be viewed in the office of the City Clerk, Room 103, Medford City Hall, Medford MA, call 781-393-2425 for any accommodations aids.

315
00:29:32,133 --> 00:29:37,538
[SPEAKER_09]: City of Medford is an EEOA 504 employer by order of the City Council, signed Adam L. Herdeby, City Clerk.

316
00:29:38,988 --> 00:29:45,591
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to reopen the public hearing, or as was continued from the last meeting, public hearing is reopened.

317
00:29:46,131 --> 00:29:49,033
[SPEAKER_09]: And if the petitioner would like to speak about their revised request.

318
00:29:53,775 --> 00:29:54,295
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you so much.

319
00:29:55,476 --> 00:29:57,137
[SPEAKER_16]: Amante or 491 Riverside Avenue.

320
00:29:58,666 --> 00:30:05,969
[SPEAKER_16]: So we come back today, we hear your concern last time, and we see that we are taking back the time.

321
00:30:06,169 --> 00:30:08,050
[SPEAKER_16]: So Monday through Thursday until 12 a.m.

322
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:10,371
[SPEAKER_16]: and Friday, Saturday and Sunday until 1 a.m.

323
00:30:10,931 --> 00:30:19,555
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't have a drive-through, we're not going to have the speaker coming out from the voice that's going to be disturbing neighbors.

324
00:30:20,055 --> 00:30:27,198
[SPEAKER_16]: At the same time, we also see that we're gonna be a community partner and work together to find a solution here.

325
00:30:28,166 --> 00:30:28,586
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

326
00:30:28,606 --> 00:30:31,228
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll open it up to questions from the council.

327
00:30:31,248 --> 00:30:33,690
[SPEAKER_09]: You can go to Councilor Scarpelli.

328
00:30:34,871 --> 00:30:36,572
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, President Beas.

329
00:30:37,513 --> 00:30:39,034
[SPEAKER_05]: So I did take some time.

330
00:30:39,134 --> 00:30:45,539
[SPEAKER_05]: I contacted our code enforcement officer and like we thought, Panda Express is

331
00:30:46,175 --> 00:30:51,420
[SPEAKER_05]: has done a great job with everything they do and above board.

332
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,661
[SPEAKER_05]: So we really appreciate that.

333
00:30:52,701 --> 00:31:01,029
[SPEAKER_05]: But as I went through and talked to some neighbors, I think there's gotta be some consistency with our decision.

334
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:10,758
[SPEAKER_05]: We voted to keep the permit, the hours of operations for Raising Cane, Dave's Hot Chicken,

335
00:31:12,259 --> 00:31:14,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we have the wings wing stop.

336
00:31:15,482 --> 00:31:24,049
[SPEAKER_05]: I think all of those restaurants and those establishments have a schedule from 11 o'clock to 11 11 a.m.

337
00:31:24,089 --> 00:31:24,829
[SPEAKER_05]: to 11 p.m.

338
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:31,515
[SPEAKER_05]: and I think that we've heard for some neighbors that live directly across the street and

339
00:31:33,382 --> 00:31:38,286
[SPEAKER_05]: and that there are some residents in that area, unfortunately, directly across the street.

340
00:31:38,346 --> 00:31:43,149
[SPEAKER_05]: So I wouldn't be able to support a special permit at this time.

341
00:31:43,169 --> 00:31:53,097
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that under the umbrella of being consistent, respecting our neighbors and the

342
00:31:54,918 --> 00:32:05,966
[SPEAKER_05]: past outcomes and decisions that we made for local establishments that are in that vicinity, I would recommend that we do not support a special permit at this time.

343
00:32:06,447 --> 00:32:07,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

344
00:32:08,208 --> 00:32:09,349
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

345
00:32:09,389 --> 00:32:11,430
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further questions or comments by members of the Council?

346
00:32:13,532 --> 00:32:13,872
[SPEAKER_09]: One second.

347
00:32:14,913 --> 00:32:16,034
[SPEAKER_09]: Council Vice President Collins.

348
00:32:18,493 --> 00:32:18,873
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

349
00:32:19,234 --> 00:32:20,735
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for appearing before us today.

350
00:32:20,775 --> 00:32:26,981
[SPEAKER_17]: And I definitely appreciate, you know, the spirit of compromise with the amended proposal that you put forward.

351
00:32:27,401 --> 00:32:35,188
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that, you know, Councilor Scarponi brings up, you know, one of the most important things before this council, which is just making sure that the special permits that we extend are consistent.

352
00:32:35,208 --> 00:32:39,793
[SPEAKER_17]: I appreciate the research that you and your company did to see what other

353
00:32:40,513 --> 00:32:46,497
[SPEAKER_17]: what special permits have been granted to other restaurants to kind of keep in line with those norms.

354
00:32:48,399 --> 00:33:04,090
[SPEAKER_17]: I personally, I think that I would be willing to approve this tonight and perhaps attach a 30, 60 and 90 day review to it so that we could continue to keep in contact with city partners and local residents and as you say, you know, collaborate to if there are issues arise because of the

355
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:07,892
[SPEAKER_17]: Midnight closing Monday through Thursday and 1 a.m.

356
00:33:07,952 --> 00:33:21,582
[SPEAKER_17]: Closing Friday Saturday Sunday We can return and adjust that at those intervals But before putting forward a motion, I'd be happy to hear opinions from my fellow councillors Thank You Vice President Collins, Councilor Leming

357
00:33:22,645 --> 00:33:23,045
[SPEAKER_06]: And thank you.

358
00:33:23,065 --> 00:33:26,888
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd just say I'd be willing to support these hours as well.

359
00:33:27,249 --> 00:33:31,552
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand the concerns with consistency, but kind of two reasons.

360
00:33:31,572 --> 00:33:43,641
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that part of the issue that we didn't want to approve the raising canes permit was just because of the, I think it was a little bit more visible from more houses.

361
00:33:44,102 --> 00:33:45,763
[SPEAKER_09]: That was a, that was a complicated vote.

362
00:33:45,883 --> 00:33:47,344
[SPEAKER_09]: There were multiple special permits.

363
00:33:47,384 --> 00:33:48,525
[SPEAKER_09]: Some passed, some didn't.

364
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:49,285
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

365
00:33:49,426 --> 00:33:50,226
[SPEAKER_09]: Some we weren't sure on.

366
00:33:53,303 --> 00:34:11,794
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I understand that there are residents across the street, but it's also not, I mean, Riverside Avenue is a fairly large road, and we did approve the special permit for Pinky's Pizza, which is a lot more of a closed-in neighborhood.

367
00:34:11,874 --> 00:34:15,956
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just, yeah, I think 1 a.m.

368
00:34:15,996 --> 00:34:19,198
[SPEAKER_06]: in this case does make sense, just given the location.

369
00:34:19,778 --> 00:34:20,418
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my two cents.

370
00:34:21,923 --> 00:34:23,063
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Leming.

371
00:34:23,083 --> 00:34:23,724
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Tseng.

372
00:34:24,184 --> 00:34:24,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

373
00:34:25,924 --> 00:34:30,886
[SPEAKER_04]: I too would be willing, would be comfortable voting on this tonight, voting favorably on this tonight.

374
00:34:31,807 --> 00:34:34,948
[SPEAKER_04]: I grew up a one minute walk from where it is.

375
00:34:35,048 --> 00:34:41,850
[SPEAKER_04]: I still spend half my week over there, or a little bit less than half, but I spend a good amount of time over there.

376
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:47,753
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think there are neighbors of very different views on this, but I think Councilor Leming brings up a really great point that

377
00:34:49,854 --> 00:34:54,637
[SPEAKER_04]: it's separated by Riverside and Felsway from the residential areas.

378
00:34:54,657 --> 00:34:57,119
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is quite a large block.

379
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:04,324
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, I could not think of what we would want to be a larger block than that in the city.

380
00:35:04,584 --> 00:35:10,828
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't imagine a larger road than that to separate a shopping, a commercial zone from a residential neighborhood.

381
00:35:11,368 --> 00:35:14,470
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just the fact of how our city is designed.

382
00:35:15,211 --> 00:35:15,471
[SPEAKER_04]: I think 1 a.m.

383
00:35:18,633 --> 00:35:22,079
[SPEAKER_04]: shows good faith from you all, it shows a reasonable compromise.

384
00:35:22,801 --> 00:35:26,928
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's also important to note that

385
00:35:30,317 --> 00:35:33,480
[SPEAKER_04]: This argument about consistency can go both ways.

386
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:39,426
[SPEAKER_04]: You've cited three places that are popular locations in Medford that are open past 11 p.m.

387
00:35:39,866 --> 00:35:43,650
[SPEAKER_04]: There are also places that aren't open past 11 p.m.

388
00:35:44,191 --> 00:35:46,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the places listed that aren't open past 11 p.m.

389
00:35:46,693 --> 00:35:51,679
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't believe I've ever voted on, I have never seen a paper on special permit hours.

390
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,521
[SPEAKER_04]: And you guys have made the request.

391
00:35:54,821 --> 00:36:00,366
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it's fair because you guys asked to consider giving you guys hours past 11 p.m.

392
00:36:02,187 --> 00:36:08,832
[SPEAKER_09]: But you just want to note it's a Monday through Thursday and midnight, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, 1 a.m.

393
00:36:09,513 --> 00:36:13,876
[SPEAKER_09]: And there was a vote on raising canes last year.

394
00:36:14,157 --> 00:36:18,780
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a there was not five votes, which is the sufficiency needed to pass.

395
00:36:19,301 --> 00:36:20,662
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Callahan, Councilor Lazzaro.

396
00:36:21,749 --> 00:36:37,355
[SPEAKER_15]: I would like to suggest that we consider giving the weekend hours to one, perhaps not the during the week, as sort of matching with with during the week is just till midnight.

397
00:36:37,815 --> 00:36:42,037
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, but during the week is till midnight, which is later than they're currently are, which was 11pm.

398
00:36:42,057 --> 00:36:42,497
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that correct?

399
00:36:43,542 --> 00:37:03,697
[SPEAKER_15]: believe so yes yes so that is what I'm suggesting that it be weekend till one during the week till 11 but a little bit of a compromise on that point I don't I also don't particularly see a reason why consistency is the reason why we should agree or not agree I think you know

400
00:37:04,141 --> 00:37:06,223
[SPEAKER_15]: different businesses are in different areas of the city.

401
00:37:06,323 --> 00:37:08,524
[SPEAKER_15]: They have neighbors closer or farther away from them.

402
00:37:08,965 --> 00:37:12,568
[SPEAKER_15]: They have different track records of complaints with the city.

403
00:37:13,228 --> 00:37:24,797
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's pretty clear that Panda Express has all of those check boxes that we want to see in terms of being pretty distant from the closest housing.

404
00:37:25,978 --> 00:37:32,223
[SPEAKER_15]: But I think there could be some consideration to a possibility of giving them the extended hours for the weekend

405
00:37:34,693 --> 00:37:36,555
[SPEAKER_15]: for this vote.

406
00:37:37,697 --> 00:37:38,518
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

407
00:37:38,538 --> 00:37:39,179
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Lazzaro.

408
00:37:42,022 --> 00:37:45,286
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate your effort to compromise.

409
00:37:45,306 --> 00:37:48,090
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we've already, we have what was

410
00:37:48,877 --> 00:37:50,519
[SPEAKER_03]: a suggestion to move from 11 p.m.

411
00:37:50,559 --> 00:38:12,279
[SPEAKER_03]: to 3 a.m., and this is a compromise that's offered, I think we should vote on this compromise that was offered, and if it's not enough of a compromise, then maybe that's a no vote, but if, I will also say I grew up in a town that was extremely suburban and residential, and there were multiple 24-hour diners, which I loved, so we don't have any of those here.

412
00:38:12,919 --> 00:38:19,562
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are some people who have working hours that are different than a nine to five.

413
00:38:20,202 --> 00:38:32,266
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that having the opportunity to eat later because you have different working hours or a different lifestyle is something that I think we should be allowing our residents to have.

414
00:38:33,607 --> 00:38:36,168
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would be inclined to vote yes on this.

415
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:38,856
[SPEAKER_09]: I can think of some times I've left this room around 2 a.m.

416
00:38:39,056 --> 00:38:41,037
[SPEAKER_09]: and would like some orange chicken, but that's just me.

417
00:38:41,818 --> 00:38:42,859
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Collins.

418
00:38:43,639 --> 00:38:44,459
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, President Bears.

419
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:50,623
[SPEAKER_17]: I definitely appreciate the discussion around this and completely respect my councilors' various perspectives on the issue.

420
00:38:51,924 --> 00:39:01,469
[SPEAKER_17]: I would motion to approve the amended petition pending the public comment period and with the 30, 60, and 90-day review attached.

421
00:39:01,489 --> 00:39:03,110
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion.

422
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:05,972
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, I need to... We'll take that, but first we need to

423
00:39:06,738 --> 00:39:09,039
[SPEAKER_09]: hear from everyone, close out the public hearing, then we can take the motion.

424
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,560
[SPEAKER_09]: Any other comments from members of the council?

425
00:39:12,861 --> 00:39:14,162
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing none, I'll go back to the petitioner.

426
00:39:14,222 --> 00:39:16,883
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, it took a little longer to get back to you, but the floor is yours.

427
00:39:17,643 --> 00:39:18,103
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much.

428
00:39:19,204 --> 00:39:25,587
[SPEAKER_16]: Just wanted to also share that I also hear, you know, a lot of parts coming from the neighbor side.

429
00:39:26,047 --> 00:39:35,952
[SPEAKER_16]: So we would also be open to having a community day where we can invite the local neighborhood and able to come and share any potential concerns that can come up from the opening later hours.

430
00:39:38,353 --> 00:39:38,913
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be great.

431
00:39:39,494 --> 00:39:49,682
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, if nothing else, I'm gonna just wanna open it up to members of the public, either in the chamber or on Zoom, if they have a comment during this public hearing, either for, against, or otherwise.

432
00:39:49,702 --> 00:40:02,313
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there anyone who has a public comment on the extension of hours of Panda Express, Monday through Thursday to midnight, and Friday, Saturday, Sunday to 1 a.m.? ?

433
00:40:07,116 --> 00:40:10,999
[SPEAKER_09]: I have one person on Zoom, Douglas H. Post.

434
00:40:12,781 --> 00:40:14,262
[SPEAKER_09]: I will request that you unmute.

435
00:40:16,104 --> 00:40:17,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Name and address for the record.

436
00:40:17,105 --> 00:40:17,925
[SPEAKER_09]: You have three minutes.

437
00:40:18,926 --> 00:40:20,388
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, my name is Doug Post.

438
00:40:20,488 --> 00:40:22,569
[SPEAKER_18]: I live at 11 Mayberry here in Medford.

439
00:40:22,589 --> 00:40:26,353
[SPEAKER_18]: I am strongly in favor of this.

440
00:40:26,813 --> 00:40:32,178
[SPEAKER_18]: I think we should be grateful, particularly those of us who don't work regular hours,

441
00:40:33,407 --> 00:40:38,471
[SPEAKER_18]: to have place available for takeout and purchase of food late in the evening.

442
00:40:39,332 --> 00:40:42,854
[SPEAKER_18]: It's clearly a business district that's a shopping mall.

443
00:40:44,736 --> 00:40:47,057
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think that those hours are reasonable.

444
00:40:47,077 --> 00:40:50,900
[SPEAKER_18]: We should also be grateful that the business is doing well and contributing to the local economy.

445
00:40:51,661 --> 00:40:53,062
[SPEAKER_18]: Those are the extents of my comments.

446
00:40:53,122 --> 00:40:53,722
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you very much.

447
00:40:55,463 --> 00:40:56,044
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

448
00:40:58,666 --> 00:40:59,947
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further comment on this matter?

449
00:41:02,173 --> 00:41:05,174
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing none, I will close the public hearing.

450
00:41:05,874 --> 00:41:13,916
[SPEAKER_09]: We had a motion from Vice President Collins to approve pending public comment and with a 30, 60, 90 day review.

451
00:41:14,356 --> 00:41:17,957
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we also want to add in that the petitioner noted hosting a community day?

452
00:41:17,977 --> 00:41:21,117
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's a great thing.

453
00:41:22,778 --> 00:41:28,599
[SPEAKER_09]: So with that further amendment, as seconded by Councilor Tseng, Mr. Clerk, when you're ready, please call the roll.

454
00:41:37,649 --> 00:41:37,850
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

455
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:39,630
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

456
00:41:42,412 --> 00:41:42,652
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

457
00:41:44,973 --> 00:41:45,193
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

458
00:41:47,014 --> 00:41:47,214
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

459
00:41:49,555 --> 00:41:49,775
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

460
00:41:52,177 --> 00:41:54,698
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, affirmative or negative, the motion passes.

461
00:41:55,338 --> 00:41:56,699
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much and good luck.

462
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:06,068
[SPEAKER_09]: Motions, orders and resolutions 24470 offered by Councilor Tseng be resolved with the committee on public health and community safety.

463
00:42:06,468 --> 00:42:11,132
[SPEAKER_09]: Discuss the possibility of installing sanitary facilities in public spaces, including in our parks.

464
00:42:11,372 --> 00:42:12,213
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Tseng.

465
00:42:12,713 --> 00:42:13,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.

466
00:42:13,714 --> 00:42:27,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, this resolution comes out of discussions I've had, um, with community members of the last few years, um, around the city about having access to sanitary facilities, um, while in our, in our public spaces and

467
00:42:27,546 --> 00:42:33,952
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, public spaces owned by the city and in commercial spaces that we really want people to frequent like Medford Square.

468
00:42:40,911 --> 00:42:48,174
[SPEAKER_04]: This, you know, having sanitary facilities in public is both a public health issue, and it's also a quality of life issue.

469
00:42:49,154 --> 00:42:58,737
[SPEAKER_04]: I've also heard, particularly recently, but I've heard from in the past two from community members who've spoken about high costs that they bear for

470
00:43:00,538 --> 00:43:09,926
[SPEAKER_04]: having to hire to rent porta potties for sports events or community events that they hold in our parks as well.

471
00:43:10,447 --> 00:43:15,311
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've heard from some people with the numbers that they've been paying over the years and

472
00:43:15,991 --> 00:43:25,835
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like it really might make much more economic sense if our city takes the lead on this one and saves everyone a little bit more money and if we make the investment now.

473
00:43:26,315 --> 00:43:34,338
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, this is a big project, it's going to require a lot of thinking through logistics, it's going to require a lot of thinking through concerns as well.

474
00:43:35,138 --> 00:43:37,279
[SPEAKER_04]: I have been talking to some city staff

475
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:46,425
[SPEAKER_04]: who have some views and proposals about how we could do this at a lower cost and how we can make sure that we keep up with the maintenance of this idea.

476
00:43:47,465 --> 00:44:07,739
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, this will require discussion, walking through the logistics, and that's why I want to motion to refer this to the Committee on Public Health, because I think if we can hold a committee meeting on this and invite stakeholders to talk about benefits and concerns, we can really craft a pretty solid proposal here.

477
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:10,281
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

478
00:44:10,361 --> 00:44:11,821
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further discussion, Councilor Lazzaro?

479
00:44:13,523 --> 00:44:15,884
[SPEAKER_03]: I definitely support this resolution.

480
00:44:15,944 --> 00:44:23,589
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's really critical to offer very basic, I mean, it's a human function.

481
00:44:24,409 --> 00:44:30,793
[SPEAKER_03]: It is also, it contributes to the, how do I phrase this?

482
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:45,274
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're somebody who, there are sort of default mechanisms in cities and towns sometimes where people who are unhoused will be criminalized for it.

483
00:44:45,794 --> 00:44:50,578
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you have public restrooms, that cuts down on the likelihood of that happening.

484
00:44:50,698 --> 00:44:54,101
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is really beneficial.

485
00:44:54,121 --> 00:44:58,785
[SPEAKER_03]: I also just think, you know, we should make people's lives easier and better.

486
00:44:58,805 --> 00:45:00,186
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the business of government.

487
00:45:00,286 --> 00:45:02,688
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a great way to do that.

488
00:45:03,548 --> 00:45:07,950
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had many experiences as a parent where just sheer panic.

489
00:45:09,411 --> 00:45:12,913
[SPEAKER_03]: So this would be a really wonderful, a wonderful addition to our city.

490
00:45:12,953 --> 00:45:19,336
[SPEAKER_03]: So definitely looking into what the costs would be, how we would save money over time, I think would be a great thing to do.

491
00:45:19,536 --> 00:45:21,877
[SPEAKER_03]: So looking forward to discussing it further.

492
00:45:21,897 --> 00:45:25,619
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Vice President Collins and then Councilor Scarpelli.

493
00:45:26,653 --> 00:45:27,454
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, President Bears.

494
00:45:27,874 --> 00:45:34,919
[SPEAKER_17]: I think anything that the city can do to make it easier for residents and visitors to enjoy our public spaces, we should at least look into doing.

495
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:41,464
[SPEAKER_17]: Totally hear Councilor Tseng when he says, you know, nobody's under the impression that this is something we could roll out in six months.

496
00:45:41,885 --> 00:45:42,465
[SPEAKER_17]: Of course not.

497
00:45:42,585 --> 00:45:55,255
[SPEAKER_17]: But, you know, all the more reason to start the conversation in partnership with city partners to see, you know, what can we learn from our neighboring communities that are rolling out this kind of program more and more so that we can, you know, kind of keep up with our

498
00:45:55,615 --> 00:45:59,398
[SPEAKER_17]: with our regional neighbors and being able to offer that to people in our public spaces.

499
00:45:59,838 --> 00:46:00,118
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

500
00:46:01,139 --> 00:46:01,499
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

501
00:46:01,579 --> 00:46:02,299
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli.

502
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:05,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you Councilor Bears, Councilor President Bears, and thanks Councilor.

503
00:46:06,002 --> 00:46:09,144
[SPEAKER_05]: It's time to bring this forward.

504
00:46:09,784 --> 00:46:20,191
[SPEAKER_05]: For someone who does manage this type of facility in neighboring communities, I think it's going to be important to get the cost analysis because

505
00:46:21,031 --> 00:46:29,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, community in financial crisis, as we are right now, looking at Porter parties at a lot of our facilities could be very, very, very expensive.

506
00:46:30,014 --> 00:46:35,875
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, what would be what would be, uh, what we've done in, uh, in, in to.

507
00:46:38,689 --> 00:46:40,991
[SPEAKER_05]: hold the burden off our constituents.

508
00:46:41,031 --> 00:46:54,944
[SPEAKER_05]: We kind of maybe want to look into neighboring city facilities that we can use in different areas instead of the port-a-potties in different locations.

509
00:46:55,004 --> 00:47:01,210
[SPEAKER_05]: So that might be something interesting to see if we could set up a map or a partnership with city facilities that

510
00:47:01,890 --> 00:47:08,035
[SPEAKER_05]: residents that are using a certain park or location that they can use those sanitation facilities.

511
00:47:08,755 --> 00:47:13,238
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I will tell you it is a a huge expense.

512
00:47:13,719 --> 00:47:14,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it's a lot of money.

513
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:25,267
[SPEAKER_05]: And like I said, um, when we look at apples to apples that are coming up pretty soon, it's something that's gonna be interesting to see where we're going to tighten our belts as a city.

514
00:47:25,307 --> 00:47:26,248
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you.

515
00:47:29,176 --> 00:47:29,516
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

516
00:47:29,556 --> 00:47:30,817
[SPEAKER_09]: Any other comments, members of the council?

517
00:47:30,837 --> 00:47:31,597
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Callahan, sorry.

518
00:47:32,357 --> 00:47:33,077
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks.

519
00:47:33,557 --> 00:47:35,218
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I totally agree.

520
00:47:35,238 --> 00:47:36,398
[SPEAKER_15]: It would be great.

521
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:39,699
[SPEAKER_15]: I also agree that, you know, we have to be aware of costs.

522
00:47:40,379 --> 00:47:50,903
[SPEAKER_15]: I simply wanted to add that after I had my son, I remember traveling around and talking to all the other new moms about where you could possibly change a baby in the bathroom without laying them on the floor.

523
00:47:51,003 --> 00:47:53,463
[SPEAKER_15]: So I hope that we can include that in the discussion.

524
00:47:53,503 --> 00:47:53,803
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

525
00:47:54,984 --> 00:47:55,384
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

526
00:47:56,604 --> 00:47:58,385
[SPEAKER_09]: I tried this about three years ago.

527
00:47:58,425 --> 00:47:58,705
[SPEAKER_09]: Good luck.

528
00:48:01,657 --> 00:48:04,579
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further comment from members of the council?

529
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:07,041
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing none, we'll go to public participation.

530
00:48:07,061 --> 00:48:08,182
[SPEAKER_09]: Name and address for the record, please.

531
00:48:11,124 --> 00:48:11,964
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, President Bears.

532
00:48:11,984 --> 00:48:13,645
[SPEAKER_01]: Gaston Fiore, 61 Stickney Road.

533
00:48:13,925 --> 00:48:16,847
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this resolution clearly has good intentions.

534
00:48:17,988 --> 00:48:18,368
[SPEAKER_01]: However,

535
00:48:20,157 --> 00:48:26,679
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to, so I think in general, the public would benefit from these facilities clearly.

536
00:48:27,199 --> 00:48:32,721
[SPEAKER_01]: At the same time, you know, as Thomas Sowell would say in life, there are no solutions, there are only trade-offs.

537
00:48:33,181 --> 00:48:40,643
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm really worried about what cost to residents this would have in terms of not only the construction, but the maintenance.

538
00:48:41,616 --> 00:48:55,014
[SPEAKER_01]: and I hope that the city council evaluates all possible sources of revenues in order to build it and particularly to maintain it, including user fees, because clearly those using the facilities are the ones that are going to benefit the most from them.

539
00:48:57,202 --> 00:49:02,947
[SPEAKER_01]: we live in the 21st century, so it could be like contactless payment, very easy and affordable at the same time.

540
00:49:03,428 --> 00:49:04,749
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that should be considered.

541
00:49:04,769 --> 00:49:15,138
[SPEAKER_01]: It shouldn't just be like residents just pay the bill for this, including a lot of them that will not use them or will use them very sporadically.

542
00:49:15,298 --> 00:49:15,858
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.

543
00:49:16,999 --> 00:49:17,960
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Gaston.

544
00:49:18,401 --> 00:49:19,962
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further comment by members of the council?

545
00:49:22,604 --> 00:49:23,045
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing none.

546
00:49:24,949 --> 00:49:31,434
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion of Vice President Collins to approve and refer this to the Public Health and Community Safety Committee, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro.

547
00:49:31,494 --> 00:49:33,536
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

548
00:49:44,145 --> 00:49:44,765
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Callahan?

549
00:49:44,845 --> 00:49:45,025
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

550
00:49:46,046 --> 00:49:46,807
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Collins?

551
00:49:47,047 --> 00:49:47,247
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

552
00:49:47,647 --> 00:49:48,428
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Lazzaro?

553
00:49:48,568 --> 00:49:48,788
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

554
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:49,589
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Levee?

555
00:49:49,709 --> 00:49:49,929
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

556
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:50,950
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Scarpelli?

557
00:49:51,551 --> 00:49:51,751
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

558
00:49:53,237 --> 00:49:55,164
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Tseng President Bears.

559
00:49:55,746 --> 00:49:57,994
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, none of the negative, the motion passes.

560
00:50:00,066 --> 00:50:05,650
[SPEAKER_09]: 24-467 offered by mayor Breanna Lungo-Koehn, Capital Stabilization Fund appropriation requests.

561
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:23,322
[SPEAKER_09]: September 12 2024 regarding Capital Stabilization Fund appropriation request dear President Bears and members of the city council I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approves the following two appropriations from the Capital Stabilization Fund Spring Street at Central Avenue traffic signal safety improvement project

562
00:50:23,877 --> 00:50:39,020
[SPEAKER_09]: any amount of $283,535 and matching funds for the MAS, Department of Environmental Protection, VW and refuse truck electric grant program to purchase one electric refuse truck in the amount of $178,000.

563
00:50:40,561 --> 00:50:46,442
[SPEAKER_09]: As your honorable body knows, the capital stabilization fund presently has a balance of $5 million.

564
00:50:46,542 --> 00:50:50,963
[SPEAKER_09]: Further, any appropriation from stabilization account requires a two thirds majority vote of the city council.

565
00:50:52,537 --> 00:51:01,621
[SPEAKER_09]: Director of Traffic and Transportation, Todd Blake, will be present to answer any questions on the Traffic Safety Improvement Project, and CPA Manager, Teresa DuPont, will be available to present any and

566
00:51:02,442 --> 00:51:05,524
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll be present to answer any questions on the electric refuse truck project.

567
00:51:05,924 --> 00:51:16,811
[SPEAKER_09]: Finally, I respectfully request that both, or at least the traffic signal safety project, that your Honorable Body move forward tonight as the city is under some tight timelines for award, and Director Blake will elaborate on those at or before the meeting.

568
00:51:17,191 --> 00:51:19,612
[SPEAKER_09]: And we did receive, I'm sorry, thank you for your kind attention to this matter.

569
00:51:19,652 --> 00:51:21,473
[SPEAKER_09]: Respectfully submitted, Breanna Lungo-Koehn mayor.

570
00:51:21,974 --> 00:51:26,316
[SPEAKER_09]: We did receive a communication from Director Blake.

571
00:51:26,356 --> 00:51:28,157
[SPEAKER_09]: He's also here, but I'll read the communication.

572
00:51:30,119 --> 00:51:35,466
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm providing the following additional information in anticipation of some possible questions regarding this request.

573
00:51:35,987 --> 00:51:41,714
[SPEAKER_09]: The city's director of traffic and transportation, as well as the city engineer and former city engineer, current DPW commissioner,

574
00:51:42,247 --> 00:51:46,369
[SPEAKER_09]: Prioritize this project, that is the Central Ave Spring Street traffic signal.

575
00:51:47,790 --> 00:51:52,073
[SPEAKER_09]: Prioritize this project when developing and prioritizing the city's capital project list slash needs.

576
00:51:52,533 --> 00:51:56,516
[SPEAKER_09]: The existing traffic signal is substandard, not meeting national and state guidelines for traffic signals.

577
00:51:56,556 --> 00:52:02,179
[SPEAKER_09]: Specifically, it lacks the minimum number of signal heads per approach to only having one per approach.

578
00:52:02,199 --> 00:52:07,402
[SPEAKER_09]: The traffic signal also lacks pedestrian actuation and indications, walk slash don't walk indications, et cetera.

579
00:52:07,942 --> 00:52:11,985
[SPEAKER_09]: This project is necessary to add these important safety features as well as to provide accessible ramps

580
00:52:12,423 --> 00:52:15,244
[SPEAKER_09]: so the accommodations are available to all persons of all abilities.

581
00:52:15,884 --> 00:52:22,987
[SPEAKER_09]: The city hired a consultant to design the project, which includes an overhead mast arm for better visibility and to achieve the two signals per approach standard.

582
00:52:23,407 --> 00:52:27,329
[SPEAKER_09]: The city secured allocated funding using CityARPA to design and construct the project.

583
00:52:27,765 --> 00:52:34,790
[SPEAKER_09]: The amount sought through that program accounted for paying the consultant as well as paying for the construction of the project based on the construction cost estimate produced by that design.

584
00:52:35,290 --> 00:52:38,112
[SPEAKER_09]: During the bidding process, the city received three qualified bids.

585
00:52:38,192 --> 00:52:43,396
[SPEAKER_09]: However, unfortunately, all three bids are higher than the estimated construction costs, substantially higher.

586
00:52:43,916 --> 00:52:48,239
[SPEAKER_09]: Therefore, the project requires additional funding to be able to award a contract and proceed with construction.

587
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:50,581
[SPEAKER_09]: The city project is seeking $283,535 from the capital stabilization fund.

588
00:52:55,199 --> 00:52:58,344
[SPEAKER_09]: For context, the total construction cost is $749,535 based on the low bid plus estimated police details.

589
00:53:03,325 --> 00:53:06,406
[SPEAKER_09]: The construction estimate had been $466,135.

590
00:53:06,446 --> 00:53:09,747
[SPEAKER_09]: The design fees are $141,900.

591
00:53:11,027 --> 00:53:16,289
[SPEAKER_09]: We do not anticipate receiving lower bids if rebidding the project, and there do not appear to be cost savings from value engineering.

592
00:53:16,449 --> 00:53:18,049
[SPEAKER_09]: It is already minimum work required.

593
00:53:18,609 --> 00:53:20,230
[SPEAKER_09]: There are multiple time constraints involved.

594
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:23,831
[SPEAKER_09]: Since it is ARPA funded, the funds need to be allocated by the end of the calendar year.

595
00:53:24,271 --> 00:53:27,492
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, the contract must be awarded within 45 days of the bid opening.

596
00:53:27,592 --> 00:53:31,933
[SPEAKER_09]: Because of these time constraints, we also not only ask for the funds, but we request approval be given tonight.

597
00:53:32,352 --> 00:53:36,674
[SPEAKER_09]: without continuing to subsequent meetings, this will help ensure the award within the proper time constraint.

598
00:53:37,074 --> 00:53:45,699
[SPEAKER_09]: If we do not move forward or miss our window of opportunity to construct this project, safety will remain compromised at this location, possibly leading to incidents and or claims that could be avoided.

599
00:53:45,799 --> 00:53:48,100
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for your time and consideration on this important matter.

600
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:51,001
[SPEAKER_09]: Sincerely, Todd Blake, Director of Traffic and Transportation.

601
00:53:51,021 --> 00:53:54,683
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's the letter.

602
00:53:55,143 --> 00:54:00,366
[SPEAKER_09]: Any comments, questions, thoughts by members of the council or questions for Director Blake or Manager DuPont?

603
00:54:02,978 --> 00:54:04,859
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Callahan.

604
00:54:05,339 --> 00:54:15,943
[SPEAKER_15]: I just, I hope that we are infrequently asked to waive three readings and that we can- There's not three readings on this paper.

605
00:54:15,983 --> 00:54:17,003
[SPEAKER_09]: That was an error.

606
00:54:17,063 --> 00:54:18,724
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's an error in the letter for the mayor.

607
00:54:18,744 --> 00:54:20,464
[SPEAKER_09]: It's an appropriation request.

608
00:54:20,524 --> 00:54:21,545
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah.

609
00:54:22,245 --> 00:54:23,846
[SPEAKER_15]: Great.

610
00:54:23,926 --> 00:54:30,028
[SPEAKER_15]: As a general rule, I hope that we are infrequently asked to make quick decisions.

611
00:54:30,632 --> 00:54:33,433
[SPEAKER_15]: Apparently this is not waiving three readings, so maybe it is not a big deal.

612
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:37,395
[SPEAKER_15]: But just wanted to make that short comment.

613
00:54:38,996 --> 00:54:40,576
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Kaya and Vice President Collins.

614
00:54:41,797 --> 00:54:42,617
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, President Bears.

615
00:54:43,538 --> 00:54:47,859
[SPEAKER_17]: Appreciate you being with us today, Director Blake, and for communicating about this ahead of time.

616
00:54:47,879 --> 00:54:53,882
[SPEAKER_17]: My only major question going into this appropriation request was essentially why this, why no.

617
00:54:53,942 --> 00:54:55,603
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that's been laid out very clearly.

618
00:54:57,304 --> 00:54:58,244
[SPEAKER_17]: This is, you know,

619
00:54:58,484 --> 00:55:18,955
[SPEAKER_17]: This is an example of one of the reasons that I'm so glad that this council in partnership with the administration was able to finally set up a capital stabilization fund this year because this, it seems to me from the description given safety really is substandard at this location it's really important that we take an opportunity to bring it up to par and so important that we have

620
00:55:19,635 --> 00:55:26,617
[SPEAKER_17]: funds to pay for those improvements that we can actually access, which is not the case with a free cash balance.

621
00:55:26,817 --> 00:55:38,841
[SPEAKER_17]: We wouldn't be able to access it to leverage it for this project, and safety would go on being compromised or substandard at this location, and that's just not what our residents of this city deserve.

622
00:55:40,161 --> 00:55:48,544
[SPEAKER_17]: So I am very excited to take our first couple of votes this evening on, I think, what are very worthy capital stabilization fund appropriation requests.

623
00:55:48,784 --> 00:55:48,984
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

624
00:55:49,773 --> 00:55:50,874
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Vice President Collins.

625
00:55:50,914 --> 00:56:00,420
[SPEAKER_09]: And I want to note that the mayor has reached out to schedule a committee of the whole in October to discuss stabilization fund requests.

626
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:09,446
[SPEAKER_09]: Now that ARPA funding is expiring, we're coming back to why free cash exists and exists for these one-time expenditures.

627
00:56:09,906 --> 00:56:14,589
[SPEAKER_09]: So the mayor, I'm working with the mayor to schedule a committee of the whole on an October Wednesday to discuss

628
00:56:14,889 --> 00:56:15,610
[SPEAKER_09]: for the capital stabilization fund.

629
00:56:15,630 --> 00:56:20,634
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we have the needs for departments from the stabilization funds, I think, mainly starting with the capital stabilization fund.

630
00:56:21,115 --> 00:56:34,487
[SPEAKER_09]: These two items were urgent, and that's why they're before us tonight, and the mayor communicated that to me, in addition to this letter as well, in the note that most of the other stuff will be coming to us through a committee process for review

631
00:56:41,627 --> 00:56:48,391
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just think Spring Street and Central Ave, that's a rough intersection if anyone's ever been walking through it or driving through it or biking through it.

632
00:56:48,611 --> 00:56:53,734
[SPEAKER_09]: And hopefully between this project and the speed humps, we'll see some safety improvements there.

633
00:56:54,695 --> 00:56:57,736
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further questions or discussion by members of the Council on this paper?

634
00:56:57,776 --> 00:56:58,537
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Callahan.

635
00:57:01,155 --> 00:57:01,455
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

636
00:57:01,996 --> 00:57:06,860
[SPEAKER_15]: I wanted to take this opportunity to answer a question that has come up pretty often in these chambers.

637
00:57:07,661 --> 00:57:11,164
[SPEAKER_15]: And that really is a question about why we can't use free cash.

638
00:57:13,166 --> 00:57:20,533
[SPEAKER_15]: People say that they heard that we have $34 million in free cash and why can't we use that instead of raising taxes, which I think is a very fair question.

639
00:57:21,653 --> 00:57:29,596
[SPEAKER_15]: And I would like people to consider the way that city budgets and city finances are similar to household finances.

640
00:57:30,456 --> 00:57:33,057
[SPEAKER_15]: When you run a household, you've got income, you've got expenses.

641
00:57:33,397 --> 00:57:41,640
[SPEAKER_15]: If you make your operating budget, your normal budget for the year, you want to look at your income and hope that your budget adds up to less than your total income.

642
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:45,921
[SPEAKER_15]: And in your household, you probably also have a savings account.

643
00:57:46,850 --> 00:57:50,673
[SPEAKER_15]: It's good to have a savings account for one time or unexpected expenses.

644
00:57:51,113 --> 00:57:55,136
[SPEAKER_15]: Your kid might need braces, your roof might need repair, you might need to get a new car.

645
00:57:55,916 --> 00:57:58,458
[SPEAKER_15]: Cities also need to have savings accounts for similar reasons.

646
00:57:58,925 --> 00:58:07,292
[SPEAKER_15]: At some point, we will need a new fire station, we'll need a new high school, there might be a pandemic and our schools suddenly need HVAC systems to all be replaced at the same time.

647
00:58:07,873 --> 00:58:17,921
[SPEAKER_15]: The short answer to why we should not use free cash for normal budgeted items is that free cash is savings, and we need it to fix things that are getting older, like buildings or fire trucks.

648
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:20,529
[SPEAKER_15]: or in case some unexpected emergency happens.

649
00:58:21,889 --> 00:58:24,070
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, what is free cash exactly?

650
00:58:24,991 --> 00:58:27,752
[SPEAKER_15]: It is really a dumb name because it's not free and it's not cash.

651
00:58:29,032 --> 00:58:32,794
[SPEAKER_15]: Every year, the city makes a budget and then throughout the year, we spend money.

652
00:58:33,314 --> 00:58:37,336
[SPEAKER_15]: If we spend less than we budgeted, that amount left over is called free cash.

653
00:58:38,416 --> 00:58:40,837
[SPEAKER_15]: So if we budget $180 million and then we spend $172 million, that gives us $8 million in free cash.

654
00:58:45,439 --> 00:58:51,761
[SPEAKER_15]: And what's important to understand is that every city is strongly encouraged by the state to have free cash every year.

655
00:58:52,021 --> 00:58:54,121
[SPEAKER_15]: Cities must spend less than their budget.

656
00:58:54,581 --> 00:58:57,122
[SPEAKER_15]: If they spend more than their budget, their bond rating goes down.

657
00:58:57,422 --> 00:58:57,862
[SPEAKER_15]: Bond rating.

658
00:58:58,002 --> 00:58:58,762
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like a credit rating.

659
00:58:59,203 --> 00:59:03,444
[SPEAKER_15]: And if your bond rating goes down, then it costs you an arm and a leg in interest and fees to borrow money.

660
00:59:04,784 --> 00:59:06,764
[SPEAKER_15]: Spending more than you budgeted is a big no-no.

661
00:59:06,784 --> 00:59:08,765
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a sign that your city is being poorly run.

662
00:59:09,597 --> 00:59:12,440
[SPEAKER_15]: So yay for Medford that recently we have free cash every year.

663
00:59:12,681 --> 00:59:16,825
[SPEAKER_15]: This has raised our bond rating up to a double A plus rating last few years.

664
00:59:17,666 --> 00:59:22,832
[SPEAKER_15]: The division of local services is a state body that helps cities and towns be financially responsible.

665
00:59:23,331 --> 00:59:30,478
[SPEAKER_15]: It recommends cities and towns have between three and 5% of their total budget and free cash every year to maintain a good bond rating.

666
00:59:30,979 --> 00:59:34,422
[SPEAKER_15]: And in Medford, that is between 5 million and 9 million each year.

667
00:59:35,383 --> 00:59:44,553
[SPEAKER_15]: Our $34 million in certified free cash is primarily because we had $9 million in 2023 due to remaining ARPA COVID grant funds.

668
00:59:45,309 --> 00:59:49,251
[SPEAKER_15]: 9 million in 2022 because of unfilled state positions and legal funds not being spent.

669
00:59:49,831 --> 00:59:53,213
[SPEAKER_15]: Both of these years are within the recommended three to 5% of our budget.

670
00:59:56,355 --> 01:00:05,279
[SPEAKER_15]: Before about 2012, we had almost no free cash each year, which really is a sign of not being managed, financially managed properly.

671
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:12,123
[SPEAKER_15]: And the state recommends that municipalities create what are called stabilization funds.

672
01:00:13,877 --> 01:00:23,947
[SPEAKER_15]: Almost every city and town at the start of 2024, all but four cities and towns out of 351 had at least one stabilization fund.

673
01:00:24,808 --> 01:00:26,890
[SPEAKER_15]: We were one of only four that did not.

674
01:00:27,330 --> 01:00:31,955
[SPEAKER_15]: We finally, this year, have created two stabilization funds.

675
01:00:34,147 --> 01:00:40,031
[SPEAKER_15]: And what's important to remember, do not use your savings, free cash or stabilization funds for normal operating expenses.

676
01:00:40,391 --> 01:00:49,217
[SPEAKER_15]: The division of local services says, quote, free cash should be restricted to paying one-time expenditures, funding capital projects or replenishing other reserves.

677
01:00:49,617 --> 01:00:56,522
[SPEAKER_15]: It recommends that communities adopt a free cash policy that avoids supplementing current year departmental operations.

678
01:01:00,705 --> 01:01:00,865
[SPEAKER_15]: So,

679
01:01:02,236 --> 01:01:06,760
[SPEAKER_15]: We are recommended by the state to have a certain amount of money in our stabilization funds.

680
01:01:08,061 --> 01:01:18,791
[SPEAKER_15]: For Medford, it's five to 7%, which is what they recommend would be between nine and $13 million in our general stabilization fund.

681
01:01:20,913 --> 01:01:27,419
[SPEAKER_15]: And just to understand a little bit about what we might use these stabilization funds

682
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:28,831
[SPEAKER_15]: or free cash for.

683
01:01:29,692 --> 01:01:43,146
[SPEAKER_15]: We do have, according to our payment analysis, $67 million in essentially road debt because we have not kept our roads up as much as we should have.

684
01:01:43,186 --> 01:01:43,867
[SPEAKER_15]: It costs less.

685
01:01:44,932 --> 01:01:49,176
[SPEAKER_15]: Each year, if your roads are in good shape, then it costs if your roads are in bad shape.

686
01:01:49,196 --> 01:01:51,859
[SPEAKER_15]: So we need to make sure that we are doing those improvements.

687
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:59,727
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we also have a capital improvement plan, which has recognized $79 million in needs from about 123 projects across the city.

688
01:02:05,052 --> 01:02:22,283
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just want to be pretty clear that when you look at what we are recommended to do by the state in order to be a financially responsible city, that means that we should continue to create a budget that we know we won't exceed.

689
01:02:22,564 --> 01:02:29,188
[SPEAKER_15]: At the end of each fiscal year, we should have between 3% and 5% of that total budget unspent, which is called free cash.

690
01:02:29,708 --> 01:02:33,731
[SPEAKER_15]: Those funds can move into our stabilization funds where we can spend them

691
01:02:34,275 --> 01:02:38,719
[SPEAKER_15]: properly take care of our city, which will allow us to spend less in the future.

692
01:02:40,961 --> 01:02:45,144
[SPEAKER_15]: And of course, we also want to have new growth through more commercial growth and new housing.

693
01:02:45,965 --> 01:02:46,906
[SPEAKER_15]: We already are doing that.

694
01:02:46,946 --> 01:02:52,590
[SPEAKER_15]: The last three years have seen Medford's highest new growth in the past two decades, and we will continue to encourage new growth.

695
01:02:52,911 --> 01:02:54,712
[SPEAKER_15]: Unfortunately, this is a slow process.

696
01:02:55,053 --> 01:02:56,714
[SPEAKER_15]: It cannot fix our budget shortfall.

697
01:02:57,415 --> 01:03:02,619
[SPEAKER_15]: And because of rising costs of schools, insurance, pensions, inflation affecting every department,

698
01:03:02,959 --> 01:03:10,403
[SPEAKER_15]: and other costs that we cannot control, we need to increase our annual budget, and that means voting yes on the overrides and on the debt exclusion.

699
01:03:10,683 --> 01:03:10,983
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

700
01:03:13,684 --> 01:03:14,165
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

701
01:03:14,725 --> 01:03:16,446
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further comments by members of the Council?

702
01:03:16,546 --> 01:03:17,526
[SPEAKER_09]: I see Councilor Scarpelli.

703
01:03:18,387 --> 01:03:19,207
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Councilor Bears.

704
01:03:19,287 --> 01:03:20,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.

705
01:03:21,047 --> 01:03:33,591
[SPEAKER_05]: And I very well put Councilor Callahan, but to further to expound on the free cash is the essential, the amount of money communities have over-budgeted.

706
01:03:34,131 --> 01:03:42,033
[SPEAKER_05]: And according to the Mass General Department of Revenue, free cash represents the amount of community funds that are unrestricted and avail of appropriation.

707
01:03:42,393 --> 01:03:46,835
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, the city of Medford has not had a city solicitor for many years.

708
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:50,839
[SPEAKER_05]: So that money would carry over year after year.

709
01:03:51,379 --> 01:03:56,363
[SPEAKER_05]: Every year a salary from the city solicitor includes annual budget, because no one is receiving the salary.

710
01:03:56,783 --> 01:04:06,829
[SPEAKER_05]: The amounts of that, if we put aside, city solicitor's salary goes into the city's free cash reserve for the city administration, the mayor, to use as they please if they need so.

711
01:04:07,250 --> 01:04:09,071
[SPEAKER_05]: So how does the community use its free cash?

712
01:04:10,112 --> 01:04:13,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Cities and towns in Massachusetts use free cash after it's certified.

713
01:04:13,973 --> 01:04:17,156
[SPEAKER_05]: The Mass Department of Revenue is responsible for certifying free cash.

714
01:04:17,596 --> 01:04:29,606
[SPEAKER_05]: After a city or town submits its financial information to the Department of Revenue, a community will receive its notification, the total amount of free cash, which is certified, therefore available for appropriation.

715
01:04:29,886 --> 01:04:31,907
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, does Medford have free cash?

716
01:04:32,088 --> 01:04:32,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we do.

717
01:04:33,389 --> 01:04:34,409
[SPEAKER_05]: Medford has free cash.

718
01:04:34,730 --> 01:04:39,153
[SPEAKER_05]: As of September 10th, we were looking at a total of about $34 million.

719
01:04:40,114 --> 01:04:43,417
[SPEAKER_05]: This is certified free cash, which means it's available to use.

720
01:04:44,546 --> 01:04:52,713
[SPEAKER_05]: And especially in crises when you talk about underfunding a $5 million deficit in the school department, that's what that money could be used for.

721
01:04:53,694 --> 01:05:07,184
[SPEAKER_05]: And then with the vision of financial minds working together to see if there are other avenues that we should use other than overrides, I feel it would be prudent for our community.

722
01:05:07,965 --> 01:05:12,409
[SPEAKER_05]: So most communities, the four and 5% that's been mentioned, most communities,

723
01:05:13,211 --> 01:05:19,175
[SPEAKER_05]: you see a two to maybe $3 million of free cash after every budget year.

724
01:05:19,696 --> 01:05:28,502
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, you've consistently seen with this administration an absurd amount of money going into free cash because revenues were under projected.

725
01:05:29,623 --> 01:05:33,205
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe that's done for a reason, or maybe not.

726
01:05:33,586 --> 01:05:36,668
[SPEAKER_05]: It's something that we would love to know with more transparency.

727
01:05:37,088 --> 01:05:41,071
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, this community, our community, our leadership team,

728
01:05:42,068 --> 01:05:42,689
[SPEAKER_05]: haven't done that.

729
01:05:43,269 --> 01:05:47,132
[SPEAKER_05]: So it leads us down a very, very slippery slope and it's dividing this community.

730
01:05:48,033 --> 01:06:09,851
[SPEAKER_05]: So while we have the free cash and have the opportunity to not put the fear mongering into the community about teacher cuts or school issues or our children, why not use the free cash and eliminate those fears and then sit down like we talked about in the past where I was shut down by this council to look at a more, um,

731
01:06:10,649 --> 01:06:16,438
[SPEAKER_05]: transparent, open form of participation to see where we need to do these three things.

732
01:06:16,698 --> 01:06:20,844
[SPEAKER_05]: One understanding how the city got to this financial situation to

733
01:06:21,963 --> 01:06:23,423
[SPEAKER_05]: How are we going to fix it?

734
01:06:23,683 --> 01:06:26,584
[SPEAKER_05]: And three, what are we doing never to see this ever again?

735
01:06:27,284 --> 01:06:30,926
[SPEAKER_05]: And this council and this mayor and this administration haven't done that.

736
01:06:31,706 --> 01:06:40,668
[SPEAKER_05]: So to ask for an override right now is just absolutely frightening, especially to the homeowners that are living on a fixed income that we're looking at possibly losing their homes.

737
01:06:41,308 --> 01:06:50,051
[SPEAKER_05]: So in the same vein as my fellow councilor asked to vote for the override, I'm going to implore to our residents that

738
01:06:50,791 --> 01:06:57,055
[SPEAKER_05]: This is two different cases, two different stories, and it's going to be important so people can understand the truth.

739
01:06:57,675 --> 01:07:07,500
[SPEAKER_05]: And the truth is, the city has mismanaged its budgets and mismanaged its organization in the city for years.

740
01:07:08,221 --> 01:07:15,005
[SPEAKER_05]: And we see this with a $9 million certified free cash.

741
01:07:15,405 --> 01:07:16,806
[SPEAKER_05]: That is unheard of, my friends.

742
01:07:17,580 --> 01:07:19,061
[SPEAKER_05]: So yes, it is true.

743
01:07:19,481 --> 01:07:23,123
[SPEAKER_05]: When you do take money out of free cash, it could possibly hurt your bond rating.

744
01:07:24,144 --> 01:07:36,731
[SPEAKER_05]: But when you have $34 million, taking $5 million out to make sure our schools and our children have no fear of what might happen down the line, why wouldn't we do that?

745
01:07:37,291 --> 01:07:38,812
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you, Mr. President.

746
01:07:41,033 --> 01:07:42,414
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Vice President Collins.

747
01:07:44,278 --> 01:07:45,099
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, President Bears.

748
01:07:45,159 --> 01:07:50,703
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you to my fellow colleagues for a substantive conversation around this paper.

749
01:07:50,723 --> 01:08:03,812
[SPEAKER_17]: I just wanna recenter that we are talking about capital stabilization fund appropriation requests and not an override and not about financial mismanagement of which there's been no evidence in the city.

750
01:08:04,893 --> 01:08:07,114
[SPEAKER_17]: I would motion to approve the papers before us.

751
01:08:09,596 --> 01:08:13,079
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion of Vice President Collins to approve, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

752
01:08:13,806 --> 01:08:16,427
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, if I can, I'm sorry.

753
01:08:17,147 --> 01:08:18,747
[SPEAKER_05]: I couldn't get my hand up fast enough.

754
01:08:19,108 --> 01:08:20,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we sever this, please?

755
01:08:20,408 --> 01:08:41,094
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I think with the financial questions we have in our community, I would support the traffic motion, but I think that we would have to look at this separate piece as something we can hold off until after the override vote is taken because

756
01:08:41,634 --> 01:08:57,146
[SPEAKER_05]: If we are in fiscal crisis and this vote is taken in November and it's voted down, this could be crucial money to assist for the fraudulent process that was put forth to us where we hear all these cuts going to be made in the school department.

757
01:08:57,166 --> 01:08:58,867
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would request we would sever this.

758
01:08:59,871 --> 01:09:20,689
[SPEAKER_05]: in a motion and then uh and really think twice before we vote on any money paper right now um dealing with um dealing with uh with any any project that doesn't have to do with safety or our children seniors so thank you that's a formal motion thank you sever is there a second on the motion to sever

759
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:24,621
[SPEAKER_09]: seconded by councilor Callahan.

760
01:09:24,641 --> 01:09:25,802
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to note two things.

761
01:09:26,542 --> 01:09:28,624
[SPEAKER_09]: Free cash to the balance is no longer 34 million.

762
01:09:28,985 --> 01:09:34,449
[SPEAKER_09]: There were at least $11 million in appropriations on June 25th to these stabilization funds.

763
01:09:35,490 --> 01:09:40,995
[SPEAKER_09]: And the request before us tonight are appropriations from the capital stabilization fund, which is for capital purposes.

764
01:09:41,095 --> 01:09:45,018
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's what these funds can be used for at this point.

765
01:09:45,999 --> 01:09:50,903
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion to sever the two papers by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

766
01:09:51,504 --> 01:09:52,645
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

767
01:09:53,305 --> 01:09:53,926
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Callahan?

768
01:09:54,006 --> 01:09:54,206
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

769
01:09:55,227 --> 01:09:55,987
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Collins?

770
01:09:56,068 --> 01:09:56,288
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

771
01:09:57,589 --> 01:09:58,590
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Lazzaro?

772
01:10:01,452 --> 01:10:01,732
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

773
01:10:03,694 --> 01:10:04,234
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Leming?

774
01:10:04,454 --> 01:10:04,675
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

775
01:10:04,695 --> 01:10:07,277
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Scarpelli?

776
01:10:07,497 --> 01:10:07,797
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

777
01:10:09,178 --> 01:10:09,719
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Tseng?

778
01:10:09,819 --> 01:10:10,039
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

779
01:10:10,820 --> 01:10:11,400
[SPEAKER_08]: President Pierce?

780
01:10:11,781 --> 01:10:11,941
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

781
01:10:13,834 --> 01:10:15,775
[SPEAKER_09]: Finally, if there were two in the negative, the motion passes.

782
01:10:15,875 --> 01:10:25,121
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to note now that this is severed, change my vote to yes, because I might need the Councilor to take this.

783
01:10:25,701 --> 01:10:27,242
[SPEAKER_09]: There's matching funds for a grant here.

784
01:10:27,682 --> 01:10:32,505
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'd like to hear from Director DuPont about what a delay would mean.

785
01:10:36,988 --> 01:10:37,628
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, manager.

786
01:10:37,688 --> 01:10:38,890
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, I love it.

787
01:10:39,390 --> 01:10:40,971
[SPEAKER_09]: I have literally no authority to do that.

788
01:10:40,991 --> 01:10:41,912
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all right.

789
01:10:42,553 --> 01:10:47,978
[SPEAKER_02]: Theresa DuPont, I'm the Community Preservation Act Manager here for the city, representing this request for the amount of $178,000.

790
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:59,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to give a little bit of backstory, and I apologize that I just did not have the time to send quite as a bit of a write-up as Director Blake did, but I'm here to answer some questions.

791
01:11:00,188 --> 01:11:02,989
[SPEAKER_02]: This grant is through the Mass Department of Environmental Protections.

792
01:11:03,509 --> 01:11:09,071
[SPEAKER_02]: It is funded by the Volkswagen emissions scandal that happened a few years ago.

793
01:11:09,111 --> 01:11:10,591
[SPEAKER_02]: They were fined $15 billion.

794
01:11:11,091 --> 01:11:19,874
[SPEAKER_02]: So those funds are being redistributed to cities, towns, and states as well to fund these type of grant programs.

795
01:11:21,634 --> 01:11:27,660
[SPEAKER_02]: So match funding tonight would purchase a 2023 electric trash packer.

796
01:11:27,860 --> 01:11:30,283
[SPEAKER_02]: It would remove our current packer, which is on the road.

797
01:11:30,843 --> 01:11:36,088
[SPEAKER_02]: It was born in 1998, and it's been a workhorse, certainly has.

798
01:11:36,108 --> 01:11:37,149
[SPEAKER_02]: It is diesel-fueled.

799
01:11:37,930 --> 01:11:50,878
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, electrifying our municipal fleet is both a goal outlined in the Commonwealth's 2020, I'm sorry, 2030 solid waste plan, as well as our own local climate action and adaptation plan.

800
01:11:51,658 --> 01:11:54,840
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is in alignment with electrifying our municipal fleet vehicles.

801
01:11:55,140 --> 01:12:00,603
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, 90% of our fleet vehicles are considered medium or heavy duty.

802
01:12:00,643 --> 01:12:01,444
[SPEAKER_02]: So these will be our

803
01:12:02,130 --> 01:12:03,651
[SPEAKER_02]: gasoline, mostly diesel powered.

804
01:12:04,392 --> 01:12:09,196
[SPEAKER_02]: So 10% of our fleet vehicles are your passenger vehicles and what have you.

805
01:12:10,177 --> 01:12:14,641
[SPEAKER_02]: So this would help us get to our carbon neutral goal of 2050.

806
01:12:14,681 --> 01:12:21,647
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say to speak on the funding portion, we did look at other avenues to find this match funding and it's just not available.

807
01:12:21,707 --> 01:12:24,970
[SPEAKER_02]: ARPA funding is not available for this and operating budget also.

808
01:12:25,130 --> 01:12:27,853
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is why we are coming asking for stabilization fund.

809
01:12:27,873 --> 01:12:29,314
[SPEAKER_09]: What would a delay mean?

810
01:12:30,225 --> 01:12:37,466
[SPEAKER_02]: A delay on this, I know that we're anxious to get this moving because there are grant deadlines associated with this.

811
01:12:37,506 --> 01:12:42,947
[SPEAKER_02]: We will have to have the new electric packer functioning on the road by May of next year.

812
01:12:43,748 --> 01:12:47,348
[SPEAKER_02]: And that does take some decommissioning of our current packer.

813
01:12:47,508 --> 01:12:53,249
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's sourcing, which is probably another 60 to 90 days from approval of funding.

814
01:12:53,389 --> 01:12:55,310
[SPEAKER_02]: And then from there, probably another 90 to 120 days

815
01:12:57,310 --> 01:13:00,716
[SPEAKER_02]: So three to four months of decommissioning and getting the new Packer on the road.

816
01:13:01,277 --> 01:13:04,262
[SPEAKER_09]: So we need it in eight months and we have eight months of work to do to get this done.

817
01:13:04,382 --> 01:13:07,246
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it might not be eight months, but maybe close to six.

818
01:13:07,627 --> 01:13:07,827
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

819
01:13:07,988 --> 01:13:08,228
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

820
01:13:09,230 --> 01:13:09,871
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Collins.

821
01:13:11,001 --> 01:13:29,056
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you so much for the context and kind of speaking to how this is grounded in not just decommissioning a vehicle that's been in heavy rotation for such a long time, but bringing us closer to our local climate goals and keeping in line with the state climate goals as well.

822
01:13:29,236 --> 01:13:33,980
[SPEAKER_17]: Of course, we want to be keeping up with our municipal neighbors and doing our part as a municipality.

823
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:43,726
[SPEAKER_17]: This seems, as you outlined, there's no other funding for this, and this is something that we need, and something that we need, I think, in terms of municipal timelines fairly urgently.

824
01:13:45,027 --> 01:13:52,132
[SPEAKER_17]: With that in mind, I think this vote to me is unambiguous, and I would actually like to make a motion to reconsider the previous vote to sever.

825
01:13:52,492 --> 01:13:53,773
[SPEAKER_17]: To me, these are both slam dunk.

826
01:13:53,793 --> 01:13:55,594
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we should consider them at the same time.

827
01:13:56,795 --> 01:13:57,935
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's a motion to reconsider.

828
01:13:58,576 --> 01:13:58,796
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

829
01:13:59,361 --> 01:14:04,545
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion by Councilor Collins to reconsider the vote on the motion to sever, seconded by Councilor Leming.

830
01:14:04,745 --> 01:14:05,986
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

831
01:14:08,127 --> 01:14:13,231
[SPEAKER_09]: Just to clarify, in the motion to reconsider, a yes vote would mean that we will then take another vote.

832
01:14:13,471 --> 01:14:16,853
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you want to consider this question of severing again, you will vote yes.

833
01:14:20,255 --> 01:14:20,436
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

834
01:14:21,977 --> 01:14:22,177
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

835
01:14:23,177 --> 01:14:31,562
[SPEAKER_03]: In a vote, when you sever, are you voting separately for each of the two things, or are you only gonna vote on one of the things?

836
01:14:31,662 --> 01:14:36,666
[SPEAKER_09]: You're voting separately, but also motions can be made on them separately.

837
01:14:36,686 --> 01:14:37,586
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand.

838
01:14:39,708 --> 01:14:40,748
[SPEAKER_09]: You have a question, Councilor Callahan?

839
01:14:41,008 --> 01:14:41,429
[SPEAKER_15]: So this is...

840
01:14:44,833 --> 01:14:46,414
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, we will reconsider severing.

841
01:14:46,915 --> 01:14:48,336
[SPEAKER_15]: Or no, we will not reconsider severing.

842
01:14:48,436 --> 01:14:51,158
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, this is a vote on do we want to reconsider severing?

843
01:14:51,698 --> 01:14:59,525
[SPEAKER_09]: Because Councilor Collins was in the majority on the vote to sever, Councilor Collins can make a motion to reconsider that vote.

844
01:15:00,405 --> 01:15:07,151
[SPEAKER_09]: If we vote yes to reconsider, we would then take another vote on the motion to sever or have further discussion on the motion to sever.

845
01:15:07,191 --> 01:15:09,673
[SPEAKER_09]: Essentially, it brings us back to discussion on the motion to sever.

846
01:15:09,733 --> 01:15:09,953
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

847
01:15:11,485 --> 01:15:15,187
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion to reconsider by Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Leming.

848
01:15:15,667 --> 01:15:16,628
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

849
01:15:16,948 --> 01:15:17,628
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Callahan?

850
01:15:17,768 --> 01:15:17,949
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

851
01:15:19,469 --> 01:15:20,190
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Collins?

852
01:15:20,350 --> 01:15:20,530
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

853
01:15:22,131 --> 01:15:22,951
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Lazzaro?

854
01:15:22,971 --> 01:15:23,191
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

855
01:15:24,052 --> 01:15:24,692
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Leming?

856
01:15:24,812 --> 01:15:25,012
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

857
01:15:26,213 --> 01:15:27,053
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Scarpelli?

858
01:15:28,174 --> 01:15:28,374
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

859
01:15:30,835 --> 01:15:31,296
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Tseng?

860
01:15:31,316 --> 01:15:31,416
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

861
01:15:32,396 --> 01:15:32,997
[SPEAKER_08]: President Ferris?

862
01:15:33,057 --> 01:15:33,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

863
01:15:33,357 --> 01:15:34,618
[SPEAKER_09]: Six in the affirmative, one in the negative.

864
01:15:34,658 --> 01:15:36,098
[SPEAKER_09]: The motion to reconsider passes.

865
01:15:36,338 --> 01:15:40,821
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion to sever by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Callahan, is there further discussion?

866
01:15:46,764 --> 01:15:49,926
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing none, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll on the motion to sever.

867
01:15:57,351 --> 01:16:00,072
[SPEAKER_09]: I know we're using up those vote slips.

868
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,501
[SPEAKER_08]: Second consideration of the motion to sever.

869
01:16:14,141 --> 01:16:14,642
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Calio?

870
01:16:18,803 --> 01:16:19,504
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Collins.

871
01:16:20,164 --> 01:16:20,304
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

872
01:16:22,305 --> 01:16:22,986
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Lazzaro.

873
01:16:23,226 --> 01:16:23,406
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

874
01:16:24,907 --> 01:16:25,428
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Levee.

875
01:16:25,688 --> 01:16:25,948
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

876
01:16:27,109 --> 01:16:27,829
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Scarpelli.

877
01:16:28,450 --> 01:16:28,710
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

878
01:16:30,191 --> 01:16:30,691
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Tseng.

879
01:16:30,731 --> 01:16:30,771
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

880
01:16:31,892 --> 01:16:32,453
[SPEAKER_08]: President Bears.

881
01:16:32,953 --> 01:16:33,173
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

882
01:16:33,253 --> 01:16:36,675
[SPEAKER_09]: Five in the negative, two in the affirmative, the motion to sever fails.

883
01:16:37,176 --> 01:16:40,338
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further discussion on the paper before us?

884
01:16:40,478 --> 01:16:41,419
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Collins.

885
01:16:42,179 --> 01:16:47,243
[SPEAKER_17]: I will restate my motion to approve both of the appropriation requests before us.

886
01:16:47,748 --> 01:16:55,053
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion of Vice President Collins to approve the appropriation request, seconded by Councilor Leming, is appropriation from the Capital Stabilization Fund.

887
01:16:55,554 --> 01:16:57,175
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further discussion by members of the Council?

888
01:17:00,217 --> 01:17:02,218
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing none, we'll go to members of the public.

889
01:17:02,338 --> 01:17:04,200
[SPEAKER_09]: We will go to the podium.

890
01:17:04,860 --> 01:17:06,361
[SPEAKER_09]: Gaston, name and address for the record.

891
01:17:06,381 --> 01:17:07,282
[SPEAKER_09]: You have three minutes.

892
01:17:11,004 --> 01:17:25,862
[SPEAKER_01]: In general, I support this electric truck grant, you know, too much the funds for the grant, but however I was, I am aware that this is just too much the funds, but in general,

893
01:17:26,443 --> 01:17:34,609
[SPEAKER_01]: As a resident, I'm always concerned whether every time the city buys something, whether we're following a competitive bidding process that is open to the public.

894
01:17:34,649 --> 01:17:43,215
[SPEAKER_01]: So is it subject to Chapter 30B, or given that it's a grant, we're just giving a truck that the state has decided that it's gonna give us, and then that's it?

895
01:17:43,455 --> 01:17:44,375
[SPEAKER_01]: Or how does it work?

896
01:17:44,536 --> 01:17:51,901
[SPEAKER_01]: Or we just decide to buy X truck, and then half of the funds are paid by the state, and then we need to find the other half of it?

897
01:17:52,701 --> 01:17:54,943
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to go to Director DuPont on this in a second.

898
01:17:54,983 --> 01:17:57,905
[SPEAKER_09]: It sounded like she said, Manager DuPont, I keep promoting you.

899
01:17:59,986 --> 01:18:02,528
[SPEAKER_09]: But it sounded like you said sourcing would take 60 to 90 days.

900
01:18:02,568 --> 01:18:05,070
[SPEAKER_09]: That includes a procurement process, if I'm correct.

901
01:18:05,450 --> 01:18:09,653
[SPEAKER_09]: Part of the chapter, I can't remember the chapter, but the procurement law is 30B.

902
01:18:10,154 --> 01:18:14,857
[SPEAKER_09]: The chapter procurement laws is that you have to have a defined source of the funds before you can go out to procurement.

903
01:18:15,208 --> 01:18:20,838
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that's what the issue is here that they have to have the funds approved, then go to procurement to get the vehicle.

904
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:24,384
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're just you're matching the grant amount that was authorized by DEP.

905
01:18:24,684 --> 01:18:25,586
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

906
01:18:25,986 --> 01:18:26,888
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's the answer there.

907
01:18:27,714 --> 01:18:34,619
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means basically, if I understand correctly, sorry for my ignorance on this, so it means that we will be able to spend up to whatever.

908
01:18:34,659 --> 01:18:44,667
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are basically asking for as much as we can, and then we'll just say we can spend up until here, and then we'll still have a competitive bidding process.

909
01:18:44,707 --> 01:18:44,967
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

910
01:18:45,427 --> 01:18:45,648
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

911
01:18:45,888 --> 01:18:46,328
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

912
01:18:46,368 --> 01:18:54,034
[SPEAKER_09]: The bidding is after the funding is authorized, and if the bid comes in lower than the authorized funding, then I believe that money would revert back to the source of funding.

913
01:18:58,564 --> 01:18:58,744
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

914
01:18:58,824 --> 01:18:59,064
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

915
01:18:59,424 --> 01:18:59,664
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

916
01:18:59,884 --> 01:19:00,745
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for that.

917
01:19:00,785 --> 01:19:01,205
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

918
01:19:02,945 --> 01:19:06,006
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further discussion by members of the public or members of the council?

919
01:19:08,587 --> 01:19:09,107
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Callahan.

920
01:19:10,748 --> 01:19:14,189
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm disappointed that I cannot show my support for each of these individually.

921
01:19:15,470 --> 01:19:15,770
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

922
01:19:17,950 --> 01:19:22,172
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion of Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Leming to approve, Ms.

923
01:19:22,192 --> 01:19:22,832
[SPEAKER_09]: Clerk, please call the roll.

924
01:19:26,943 --> 01:19:27,083
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

925
01:19:27,103 --> 01:19:27,183
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

926
01:19:27,263 --> 01:19:27,423
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

927
01:19:27,444 --> 01:19:27,584
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

928
01:19:27,724 --> 01:19:27,904
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

929
01:19:28,565 --> 01:19:28,685
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

930
01:19:44,002 --> 01:19:45,543
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll go to public participation.

931
01:19:45,563 --> 01:19:48,385
[SPEAKER_09]: Public participation is open.

932
01:19:49,425 --> 01:19:58,771
[SPEAKER_09]: If you can raise your hand on Zoom or go to the podium, I do have two letters to read, but I will read those after public participation by people who are either in the room or on Zoom.

933
01:20:09,178 --> 01:20:12,420
[SPEAKER_09]: Any public participation by anyone in the chamber or on Zoom?

934
01:20:13,462 --> 01:20:16,665
[SPEAKER_09]: Please raise your hand on Zoom or speak up in the chamber.

935
01:20:19,427 --> 01:20:20,928
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing none, I have two letters to read.

936
01:20:21,488 --> 01:20:26,132
[SPEAKER_09]: These were sent to me by constituents, sent to the president and requested to be read at the council meeting.

937
01:20:27,453 --> 01:20:30,576
[SPEAKER_09]: These are not reflective of, these are not statements by me.

938
01:20:30,596 --> 01:20:33,318
[SPEAKER_09]: I am reading letters from the public for public participation.

939
01:20:35,316 --> 01:20:42,082
[SPEAKER_09]: Dear councilors, I have witnessed the appalling personal attacks against our progressive city councils by people incorrectly calling themselves All Medford.

940
01:20:42,122 --> 01:20:46,325
[SPEAKER_09]: They have screamed, interrupted, kept people from speaking, and ignored honest answers to their concerns.

941
01:20:46,385 --> 01:20:47,846
[SPEAKER_09]: Meetings have dragged on to 1 a.m.

942
01:20:48,427 --> 01:20:57,815
[SPEAKER_09]: Our new city councilors are sincere, thoughtful people trying to make Medford a better place for all, with more affordable housing, an end to discrimination, and enough funding to support our underfunded public schools.

943
01:20:58,415 --> 01:21:02,298
[SPEAKER_09]: One needn't agree with them on everything, but disrespectful conduct keeps our city from moving forward.

944
01:21:02,498 --> 01:21:03,619
[SPEAKER_09]: I have lived in Medford for 43 years,

945
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:06,562
[SPEAKER_09]: and sadly will be departing soon for senior housing.

946
01:21:06,722 --> 01:21:16,050
[SPEAKER_09]: I can honestly attest that Medford is a better place now, with better schools, more diversity, a brand new police station, interesting new restaurants, and potentially a new fire station than it was when I first came here.

947
01:21:16,530 --> 01:21:22,095
[SPEAKER_09]: The effort to overturn the regressive Proposition 2.5, which has resulted in underfunding our schools and roads, is a positive thing.

948
01:21:22,635 --> 01:21:24,436
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, in the end, it will be put to the voters.

949
01:21:24,576 --> 01:21:29,999
[SPEAKER_09]: I do understand that this may pose a small hardship for low-income homeowners, but most cities and towns have already passed overrides.

950
01:21:30,119 --> 01:21:40,464
[SPEAKER_09]: People can, of course, vote against it, but they should not attack those who, in good faith, want to improve our city with essential funding by putting it on the ballot or misrepresent their views, as was done in heated discussions of the real estate transfer fee.

951
01:21:40,845 --> 01:21:41,165
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

952
01:21:41,225 --> 01:21:42,966
[SPEAKER_09]: Susan Gerard, Medford, Massachusetts.

953
01:21:45,347 --> 01:21:47,168
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the first letter, and then I have another letter.

954
01:21:48,223 --> 01:21:52,648
[SPEAKER_09]: Dear Medford City Council President Zach Bares, I request you read this letter at the next City Council meeting.

955
01:21:53,109 --> 01:22:01,559
[SPEAKER_09]: This past year, I've attended many City Council meetings, mostly on Zoom, a few in City Hall chambers, largely because of closed captioning, which allows me to hear more of what people in the chambers are saying.

956
01:22:02,120 --> 01:22:06,285
[SPEAKER_09]: The deficient sound system in City Hall, I understand, is going to be renovated, and that will be good for everyone.

957
01:22:07,068 --> 01:22:20,117
[SPEAKER_09]: A second reason I have often preferred not to be physically present in the City Council Chambers is because of an unruly mob of residents who come to meetings to register their displeasure on hot-button issues like the budget, real estate transfer fee, or renaming of the Columbus School.

958
01:22:20,578 --> 01:22:30,465
[SPEAKER_09]: These meetings have been perforated by the group ironically now known as All Medford, the small group of residents regularly indulging, screaming, shouting, and insulting our Revolution Medford-endorsed City Councilors,

959
01:22:31,226 --> 01:22:41,280
[SPEAKER_09]: After one particularly contentious meeting I attended in City Hall, councillors were individually singled out for repeated personal attacks and subjected to blanket attacks on all of them because they belonged to our revolution, Medford.

960
01:22:41,897 --> 01:22:46,778
[SPEAKER_09]: I was so disturbed by the vitriol, the lies, the hatred, and the unwillingness to even listen to what Councilors had to say.

961
01:22:47,278 --> 01:22:52,119
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm so sorry that you, Zach, and the other OR-endorsed Councilors have been subjected to this abuse.

962
01:22:52,639 --> 01:23:00,461
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to assure you that a majority of residents who voted for you and all our Revolution Medford candidates still support the work you've been doing or attempting to do in Medford.

963
01:23:00,941 --> 01:23:02,001
[SPEAKER_09]: Know that we are still here.

964
01:23:02,201 --> 01:23:03,822
[SPEAKER_09]: All Medford is not all Medford.

965
01:23:04,222 --> 01:23:10,463
[SPEAKER_09]: You were elected on the basis of the People's Platform, and we who voted for you still want to work on that agenda.

966
01:23:10,923 --> 01:23:21,132
[SPEAKER_09]: the city budget we need to support the schools and city services, the creation of an equitable and welcoming city government, desperately needed affordable housing, community safety, and a climate-resilient community.

967
01:23:21,553 --> 01:23:27,057
[SPEAKER_09]: As we explore solutions to these and other issues, I support you, as do the many who voted for our Revolution Medford candidates.

968
01:23:27,178 --> 01:23:32,102
[SPEAKER_09]: Please do not allow the not-all Medford to derail or curtail any of your intentions, goals, or efforts.

969
01:23:32,602 --> 01:23:33,663
[SPEAKER_09]: We who support you are many.

970
01:23:34,104 --> 01:23:37,927
[SPEAKER_09]: There are a small group of disgruntled people whose leadership and control has been rejected by the voters.

971
01:23:37,927 --> 01:23:38,207
[SPEAKER_09]: voters.

972
01:23:38,327 --> 01:23:42,589
[SPEAKER_09]: Sincerely, Eileen Lerner, Knight-Adams Circle, Medford, Massachusetts.

973
01:23:44,550 --> 01:23:45,271
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are the letters.

974
01:23:46,111 --> 01:23:49,453
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there anyone else who has any public comment at this time?

975
01:23:55,356 --> 01:24:00,559
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing none, is there anything else that anyone wants to look at on the agenda?

976
01:24:06,118 --> 01:24:08,680
[SPEAKER_09]: We're at unfinished business, seeing no motions.

977
01:24:08,740 --> 01:24:09,680
