1
00:00:00,364 --> 00:00:06,348
All right, welcome everyone to the May 16, 2024 meeting of the Medford Charter Study Committee.

2
00:00:07,709 --> 00:00:17,055
Our first order of business is to accept or review the minutes from our last meeting, May 2nd.

3
00:00:17,435 --> 00:00:18,996
Did everyone have a chance to look those over?

4
00:00:21,978 --> 00:00:22,278
Yes.

5
00:00:23,019 --> 00:00:23,819
Motion to accept.

6
00:00:24,459 --> 00:00:25,040
I second.

7
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,501
All in favor?

8
00:00:26,521 --> 00:00:27,441
Aye.

9
00:00:29,065 --> 00:00:29,325
Great.

10
00:00:29,865 --> 00:00:30,205
OK.

11
00:00:31,186 --> 00:00:38,627
Now, our first item is to look at Article 8.

12
00:00:41,588 --> 00:00:42,248
Let's do that.

13
00:00:43,049 --> 00:00:43,489
Let's do it.

14
00:00:44,469 --> 00:00:51,151
I know there is something from Article 4, the combined awards that we want to discuss, but let's wait until Aubrey gets here for that.

15
00:00:52,571 --> 00:00:52,911
OK.

16
00:00:54,251 --> 00:00:56,072
Did people have a chance to go?

17
00:00:56,212 --> 00:00:56,772
Here's Aubrey.

18
00:00:58,216 --> 00:01:00,277
Did people have a chance to look over Article 8?

19
00:01:01,839 --> 00:01:02,719
Mm-hmm.

20
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:03,980
Yes.

21
00:01:06,242 --> 00:01:07,683
I found a lot of it confusing.

22
00:01:07,703 --> 00:01:08,403
OK.

23
00:01:08,823 --> 00:01:12,746
And trying to sort of figure out what was for which.

24
00:01:12,826 --> 00:01:17,650
And I wasn't quite sure where this had all come from, whether this was from other charters.

25
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:21,452
So I was wondering if you could give us more of an overview of it.

26
00:01:22,053 --> 00:01:23,974
Yeah.

27
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:27,657
It basically is.

28
00:01:30,557 --> 00:01:36,502
I mean, most of the language, yes, was taken and adapted language that we've seen in other charters.

29
00:01:38,904 --> 00:01:46,891
So the main issues that the subcommittee wanted to look at with the whole committee were the timelines.

30
00:01:49,363 --> 00:01:54,585
Assuming, of course, that no 1 on the committee has an issue with, including any of these provisions that.

31
00:01:55,305 --> 00:01:59,887
The subcommittee thought would be a good idea to include such as free petition, et cetera.

32
00:02:01,128 --> 00:02:01,668
You make all that.

33
00:02:02,548 --> 00:02:04,469
Yeah, yeah, I'm going to yeah.

34
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:08,951
Um, so.

35
00:02:10,647 --> 00:02:25,561
For instance, for this first, and Eunice, thank you very much, Eunice, did a lot of research on comparing kind of what the thresholds and the timelines are for these processes and other charters.

36
00:02:27,163 --> 00:02:36,429
So for this particular, and the subcommittee, when we met, we found that this sort of goes through different levels, right?

37
00:02:36,469 --> 00:02:38,091
So this is like the first level.

38
00:02:39,111 --> 00:02:40,873
So it has the lowest threshold.

39
00:02:42,734 --> 00:02:53,442
It basically allows people to submit a petition to have something put on the agenda for one of the elected bodies.

40
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:58,622
And so what's in blue are the timelines and the thresholds.

41
00:03:00,683 --> 00:03:13,689
So just so I understand, and this is a very simple question, but for the school committee right now, if you want to put something on the agenda, you make a presentation and you ask the school committee members to put it on.

42
00:03:14,469 --> 00:03:17,951
Now they're not required to, so I guess the difference here is there's a requirement.

43
00:03:18,351 --> 00:03:18,571
Yes.

44
00:03:19,451 --> 00:03:21,052
But it's a much more complicated

45
00:03:24,006 --> 00:03:29,309
I mean, yeah, of course, ideally, this wouldn't be needed.

46
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,491
But if it were, Ron.

47
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:36,053
Yeah, I just follow up what you just said.

48
00:03:36,393 --> 00:03:46,458
This is more designed for when a counselor, a committee member, a superintendent does not allow you to get in, you have an option, an optional way to get in.

49
00:03:47,059 --> 00:03:48,320
Okay, I'd be on the agenda.

50
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:52,502
So that's pretty much the focus for this is, how do you do it on your own?

51
00:03:54,011 --> 00:04:00,954
So the only thing I did wonder about in terms of the school committee was not later than 10 weeks.

52
00:04:01,834 --> 00:04:16,080
And I thought there might need to be a clarification because let's suppose someone submitted something on June 1st and the school committee doesn't traditionally meet in the middle of the summer.

53
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:20,881
I just wondered about that.

54
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:22,202
How do we count for summer?

55
00:04:23,212 --> 00:04:24,913
Yeah, that's a good point.

56
00:04:25,954 --> 00:04:28,895
Didn't we talk about that in the subcommittee?

57
00:04:29,876 --> 00:04:31,256
I remember bringing that up.

58
00:04:31,877 --> 00:04:40,101
We did, and I think we assumed that people be aware of the calendar when going to approach these kind of petitions.

59
00:04:41,182 --> 00:04:42,022
Okay, so.

60
00:04:45,364 --> 00:04:53,008
And even if you're going in June 1st, say, I mean, I think May would probably be a bigger problem.

61
00:04:56,247 --> 00:05:01,560
mid-August, no, mid-September, right?

62
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:03,044
No, June, mid-August.

63
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,240
it would put you in mid-August.

64
00:05:07,801 --> 00:05:12,461
May 1st would put you in mid-July, but there would be time before that.

65
00:05:13,842 --> 00:05:14,762
I see what you're saying.

66
00:05:16,902 --> 00:05:23,403
You're putting it during the budget time and whatever, but it's not an unreasonable amount of time in my mind.

67
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:27,584
Do you want to make a proposal to change that?

68
00:05:28,144 --> 00:05:33,225
No, I don't because I could understand the timeliness issues.

69
00:05:39,031 --> 00:05:45,934
Okay, and then the number of signatures.

70
00:05:45,954 --> 00:05:51,996
Eunice, your note says other charters require as few as 25 and as many as 150.

71
00:05:52,056 --> 00:05:52,196
Right.

72
00:05:52,216 --> 00:05:52,816
I think we landed at 150.

73
00:05:52,856 --> 00:05:53,056
Yeah.

74
00:06:03,244 --> 00:06:31,945
For this first petition, and given some of the discussions we've had about participation and so forth, you know, and some, you know, all of the discussions we had about, you know, not putting something in the preamble to encourage, you know, a culture of participation that, you know, didn't

75
00:06:32,432 --> 00:06:50,868
you know, wasn't what the will of the committee, it seems along with, um, you know, some other discussions we've had, I'm actually more interested in lowering some of the thresholds that we have, um, to, in, you know, easier for, um, people to, you know,

76
00:06:56,908 --> 00:06:57,749
make themselves heard.

77
00:06:57,769 --> 00:07:01,731
So do you want to make a proposal to lower this 50 voter threshold?

78
00:07:02,391 --> 00:07:04,512
Yes, proposal to lower it to 25.

79
00:07:05,252 --> 00:07:07,193
Okay, but call it a motion.

80
00:07:08,454 --> 00:07:09,254
I'll make a motion.

81
00:07:09,674 --> 00:07:10,915
Can we discuss it for a second?

82
00:07:11,315 --> 00:07:11,935
Okay, sure.

83
00:07:12,936 --> 00:07:14,637
I think 25 is pretty low.

84
00:07:14,657 --> 00:07:14,637
40?

85
00:07:16,137 --> 00:07:21,080
I mean, does anybody else say feel like it's pretty low?

86
00:07:22,945 --> 00:07:23,666
It is low.

87
00:07:23,746 --> 00:07:26,668
I think it's probably pretty easy to get 25 signatures.

88
00:07:27,409 --> 00:07:28,430
Yeah, I mean.

89
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:42,722
But this is, you know, this particular, this has the lowest threshold of anything in this article because it really, all it is is to get something basically on the agenda, to get it to have, to have it be discussed.

90
00:07:42,942 --> 00:07:50,528
So, I mean, there are much higher thresholds for other things, but if you want to, I guess,

91
00:07:53,033 --> 00:07:57,694
So if Eunice's, hang on, sorry, I just want to make Phyllis a co-host so she can.

92
00:07:58,735 --> 00:07:59,455
Yeah.

93
00:07:59,555 --> 00:08:05,917
Is free petition what it's normally this I'm not, I'm not aware of the terminology.

94
00:08:05,997 --> 00:08:09,938
So is free petition what this sort of thing is usually called?

95
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:14,620
Yes, based on our review of other charters.

96
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:15,300
Okay.

97
00:08:18,065 --> 00:08:31,532
This basically ensures that you don't need to go to a member of the body to be sponsored to have your issue approved to be heard.

98
00:08:32,453 --> 00:08:46,660
As long as it's within the purview of that body, and you can't go to the school committee to discuss potholes, but as long as it's within the purview of that body and you can get X amount of signatures,

99
00:08:47,887 --> 00:08:51,189
you should be able to come before the body to discuss your issue.

100
00:08:51,729 --> 00:08:54,411
Now, again, I'm paying devil's advocate a little bit.

101
00:08:54,951 --> 00:09:06,297
How much, there's no limitation on the number of times an individual can submit one of these.

102
00:09:06,677 --> 00:09:11,680
Yes, we have no hearings shall be required on the same content more than one time a year.

103
00:09:12,454 --> 00:09:19,436
What if I'm somebody who is a rabble rouser and I want to really tie up the hands of the school committee?

104
00:09:19,956 --> 00:09:27,838
So I just submit and I've got, you know, and I just do it over and over again with different topics.

105
00:09:29,378 --> 00:09:33,519
Is there anybody on this level, there's no gatekeeper, right?

106
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,420
Gatekeeper?

107
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,321
Well, there's no one who's saying this is a reasonable thing or,

108
00:09:42,088 --> 00:09:42,949
It's just automatic.

109
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:44,109
Yeah.

110
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:46,150
Where'd you guys go?

111
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:48,551
Ron, did you want to respond?

112
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:50,271
Yeah.

113
00:09:50,731 --> 00:09:56,813
Again, this is when the regular process of trying to get on an agenda doesn't work.

114
00:09:57,233 --> 00:10:06,777
I would suggest, because I hear what Paulette's saying, but there are two different... I would suggest 50 for city council, 25 for school committee.

115
00:10:09,538 --> 00:10:09,758
Well...

116
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,543
I mean, as a former school committee member, I'm saying why?

117
00:10:14,404 --> 00:10:15,705
Why would you make it different?

118
00:10:16,246 --> 00:10:27,899
Because there are less, I go by the assumption that as far as voters go, there are less voters interested in school side than city side.

119
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,762
But when it comes to this, it's not a question of,

120
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:38,507
You could have one person who's very interested and can get 25 of their closest friends to sign on.

121
00:10:38,807 --> 00:10:40,908
Well, I'm just doing the math.

122
00:10:40,928 --> 00:10:45,470
You have a bigger pool to go get your signatures if you're doing a city council issue is my assumption.

123
00:10:46,491 --> 00:10:46,671
Yeah.

124
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:56,932
Again, this is a bypass of regular communication.

125
00:10:56,952 --> 00:11:01,813
So I'm assuming that an issue, this doesn't get used a lot.

126
00:11:03,173 --> 00:11:04,153
Right, but you're assuming.

127
00:11:05,554 --> 00:11:08,994
I also think that this rule is in existence right now.

128
00:11:09,354 --> 00:11:19,677
If we don't have a rule for free petition in our charter, we go back to general laws and general laws has it in here somewhere at some number.

129
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:22,804
It's really, it's about a number.

130
00:11:22,824 --> 00:11:27,968
I mean, it's, I don't really, I don't want to get bogged down because we have a lot to do here, but I'm 50 to 25.

131
00:11:28,588 --> 00:11:30,810
I'm fine with either way.

132
00:11:31,571 --> 00:11:32,011
Okay.

133
00:11:32,051 --> 00:11:37,415
So we have, we had three sort of, uh, Eunice suggests, uh, made a motion for 25.

134
00:11:37,455 --> 00:11:39,977
Paulette countered and said, how about 40?

135
00:11:40,778 --> 00:11:44,981
And then, uh, Ron's suggestion was 50 city council, 25 school committee.

136
00:11:45,381 --> 00:11:47,283
So, um, can we just,

137
00:11:49,111 --> 00:11:57,997
shall we, I mean, none of those have been seconded or so, how do we want to handle this?

138
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:06,962
Eunice, do you want to, I mean, does anybody want to second Eunice's motion?

139
00:12:09,444 --> 00:12:12,646
Then we vote or do we need more discussion on it?

140
00:12:13,286 --> 00:12:15,908
I second Eunice's motion.

141
00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:16,829
Okay.

142
00:12:17,596 --> 00:12:28,247
So the motion is to change the number of signatures required for this particular mechanism, free petition from 50 to 25.

143
00:12:28,407 --> 00:12:28,888
Eunice?

144
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:31,791
Yes.

145
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:33,512
Ron?

146
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:35,034
Yes.

147
00:12:35,434 --> 00:12:35,775
Phyllis?

148
00:12:38,893 --> 00:12:40,134
I have to abstain right now.

149
00:12:40,474 --> 00:12:45,977
I'm sorry, I keep losing internet connection, and I feel like I'm a little bit lost on this.

150
00:12:46,097 --> 00:12:49,319
I have been trying to catch up, so I think I'm abstaining.

151
00:12:49,579 --> 00:12:49,959
Thank you.

152
00:12:49,979 --> 00:12:50,239
Okay.

153
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:51,120
Aubrey?

154
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:56,983
I like a little bit of a barrier, but not a big barrier, so I'll say yes.

155
00:12:57,783 --> 00:12:58,263
Okay.

156
00:12:58,463 --> 00:12:58,844
Paula?

157
00:12:59,444 --> 00:12:59,644
No.

158
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:02,505
Okay.

159
00:13:04,767 --> 00:13:05,067
Anthony?

160
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:08,553
Yes.

161
00:13:09,795 --> 00:13:10,876
Okay.

162
00:13:10,896 --> 00:13:15,081
And there's I'm sharing screen so I can't see everybody.

163
00:13:15,841 --> 00:13:16,923
What did I miss?

164
00:13:18,344 --> 00:13:18,704
You?

165
00:13:19,726 --> 00:13:20,987
Yeah, everybody but me.

166
00:13:21,748 --> 00:13:21,928
Yep.

167
00:13:22,388 --> 00:13:22,689
Okay.

168
00:13:23,329 --> 00:13:23,910
I'll vote yes.

169
00:13:24,591 --> 00:13:25,612
Okay, so.

170
00:13:27,114 --> 00:13:28,375
So that will be lowered to 25.

171
00:13:30,985 --> 00:13:42,273
And I did have another question on there and I think it kind of, um, will follow with some of the other, um, uh, sections on this too.

172
00:13:42,293 --> 00:13:55,703
Um, where it talks about, um, uh, uh, every petition addressed to the city council that assigned by not less than 25 voters along with addresses.

173
00:13:57,024 --> 00:13:57,104
Um,

174
00:13:58,957 --> 00:14:04,162
Who is, where is this, you know, form of a petition coming from?

175
00:14:04,242 --> 00:14:15,632
Is it just, if I decide that I want to talk about X, I'm, you know, you know, pulling a piece of paper out of a notebook and, you know, going around to my, you know,

176
00:14:16,642 --> 00:14:32,448
neighbors to sign it or is this going to be a form from the city clerk or is it going to be a change.org petition which does not capture addresses?

177
00:14:33,609 --> 00:14:36,430
Well, it has to capture addresses because that's what it says.

178
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:43,293
Generally, the city clerk would verify the addresses.

179
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:48,608
and verify that they were actually registered voters.

180
00:14:51,292 --> 00:14:57,374
So then is any individual that wants to create one of these petitions.

181
00:14:57,454 --> 00:15:06,258
And I think when we jump to sections 8-2 and some of the other following ones, we kind of get into the same language.

182
00:15:07,758 --> 00:15:13,800
So is it going to be like an official form, like when you're wanting to get on the ballot?

183
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:17,802
Or is it going to be just pulling a piece of paper out of a notebook

184
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:19,878
hoping for the best.

185
00:15:20,499 --> 00:15:22,780
This is a question we can ask the Collins Center.

186
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:47,212
I mean, it could be an official petition, but, you know, that wouldn't necessarily mean it would have, I mean, these particular issues, like let's say you were doing this one, you wouldn't have an official form unless there was a form that sort of left the part blank where you would write in what the petition was about.

187
00:15:48,605 --> 00:15:53,468
The other thing, too, is I don't think the city clerk manages the school committee, so.

188
00:15:54,969 --> 00:15:55,790
That's true.

189
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:58,812
Our verbiage here says city clerk or school committee.

190
00:15:59,212 --> 00:15:59,872
Yes, you're right.

191
00:16:00,593 --> 00:16:02,054
So maybe that way.

192
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:03,835
Yes.

193
00:16:04,455 --> 00:16:07,777
But we can ask the call-in center about that.

194
00:16:08,558 --> 00:16:10,619
I have a question, please.

195
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,621
Just kind of how this would work.

196
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:17,123
Would the process be that a person

197
00:16:17,741 --> 00:16:28,210
who wanted to put something on the agenda would first have to go to, say, the president of the city council and say, hey, you know, I wanna, I wanna.

198
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:28,651
No.

199
00:16:30,612 --> 00:16:31,693
I don't think they would.

200
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:39,140
Then, wouldn't it rather the process be something like that?

201
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:44,585
Wouldn't, you know, have the regular protocol and if the,

202
00:16:45,537 --> 00:17:03,003
City Council person decided not to bring it forward, then maybe they will be supplied some type of form for, well, you can go and get a petition together and kind of force us to listen to it.

203
00:17:03,463 --> 00:17:05,984
That's how we envision that this would be used.

204
00:17:06,264 --> 00:17:11,026
It doesn't specifically say that here, but that's what the intent is.

205
00:17:11,566 --> 00:17:11,786
Ron.

206
00:17:13,108 --> 00:17:18,830
Yeah, to Anthony's question, every city councilor can put anything on the agenda that they need.

207
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:22,271
So that's the first line to go to.

208
00:17:22,991 --> 00:17:24,931
This is just another option.

209
00:17:24,951 --> 00:17:27,112
You don't have to be rejected by the city council.

210
00:17:27,192 --> 00:17:29,653
You can use this if you don't want to talk to the city council.

211
00:17:30,173 --> 00:17:35,054
But as far as managing the paperwork, I don't think we need to get bogged down in that.

212
00:17:35,174 --> 00:17:37,735
We're saying that it's managed by the city clerk or by the

213
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:43,842
If they wanted to design a form for signatures, fine.

214
00:17:44,323 --> 00:17:47,750
But this just states that if you get 25 signatures with addresses,

215
00:17:48,619 --> 00:17:51,560
and hand it in, they must address it and they must vet it.

216
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:56,443
So if they come back to you and say six of the addresses are wrong, then you have to fix it.

217
00:17:56,883 --> 00:18:06,407
But this is just another device for citizens to get something on the agenda, this issue, to get on the agenda.

218
00:18:06,427 --> 00:18:11,149
You can call your city council, that's how most people do it, and they can put anything on the agenda.

219
00:18:11,329 --> 00:18:15,311
So anyways, just wanna clarify so we can move on.

220
00:18:15,551 --> 00:18:16,512
Great, thank you, Graham.

221
00:18:17,522 --> 00:18:20,624
The next section is about citizen initiative measures.

222
00:18:21,584 --> 00:18:24,946
Here's Genia.

223
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:42,575
We have certain thresholds and timelines in there and included in the comments is all the research that Eunice did on other communities so that people could get a sense of where the subcommittees

224
00:18:44,462 --> 00:18:51,888
landed in relationship to that, and also in case anybody thinks maybe there should be tweaking.

225
00:18:52,869 --> 00:18:57,753
So does anybody have any questions or comments or proposals for this part?

226
00:19:04,278 --> 00:19:10,504
So in this one, we're looking for, this is in the case where someone wants a particular

227
00:19:14,532 --> 00:19:20,536
measure passed, not just discussed, right?

228
00:19:20,616 --> 00:19:23,437
I'm just trying to be clear about what the distinctions are.

229
00:19:24,278 --> 00:19:24,458
Yep.

230
00:19:27,719 --> 00:19:30,201
Yes, that is how I read it.

231
00:19:30,341 --> 00:19:35,343
And this one needs signatures from every ward.

232
00:19:35,904 --> 00:19:41,727
Now, does this one include, this is both school committee and city council,

233
00:19:48,867 --> 00:19:51,868
Yes, and there is a process after the petition.

234
00:19:51,908 --> 00:19:55,189
There's a referral to the city solicitor to review it.

235
00:19:55,209 --> 00:19:59,931
The processes get more involved as you go.

236
00:20:10,035 --> 00:20:18,221
That's why I asked people to read this and see if you had any issues with that.

237
00:20:18,261 --> 00:20:22,625
Again, this is another place where I would also be thinking of dropping the threshold a little bit.

238
00:20:23,285 --> 00:20:23,806
Which one?

239
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:25,987
Let's see.

240
00:20:26,668 --> 00:20:35,094
Petition be signed by not less than 250 voters, not less than 25 from each ward.

241
00:20:35,294 --> 00:20:37,296
My proposal would be to drop it down to

242
00:20:39,157 --> 00:20:41,558
200 voters and 20 per ward.

243
00:20:41,578 --> 00:20:46,859
Okay, so go ahead.

244
00:20:47,239 --> 00:20:47,959
Was that you, Phyllis?

245
00:20:48,459 --> 00:20:52,900
Yeah, and I'm sorry because I'm on this phone because for some reason my computer must be on the fritz.

246
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:53,940
I keep losing you.

247
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:57,221
Eunice, why do you want to drop it?

248
00:20:59,422 --> 00:21:00,782
You know, we've had a number of

249
00:21:01,733 --> 00:21:06,314
conversations about community participation and public engagement and so forth.

250
00:21:07,255 --> 00:21:12,496
And, um, you know, this is one way for the public to be heard.

251
00:21:12,516 --> 00:21:24,940
And, um, you know, some of the other concerns and considerations that I had, as well as a couple of others, um, it wasn't the will of this committee.

252
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,441
Um, so I think in order to,

253
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:39,822
give the public as much ease as possible, still not making it a gimme so far.

254
00:21:39,862 --> 00:21:41,625
They need to work a bit for it.

255
00:21:46,931 --> 00:22:01,342
So it's not frivolous, but in order to make it reasonably easy for the public to engage with their elected officials, I'd like to drop the thresholds just a bit.

256
00:22:02,903 --> 00:22:09,228
As you can see from Eunice's notes of quite a few communities, there's a wide range.

257
00:22:14,332 --> 00:22:21,778
A few, they really only have three, Peabody, Malden, and Waltham, that's interesting.

258
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:29,084
And then some, Newton is 50, and then some say a percentage of registered voters, which would be quite a bit.

259
00:22:29,565 --> 00:22:34,829
And some of the other things later in the article, the threshold just keeps getting higher.

260
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:38,672
So for this particular threshold, this is just the first step.

261
00:22:42,399 --> 00:23:09,902
to what this isn't to to be heard this is to initiate a process right it's yeah go ahead ultimately this in section g would be voted on yeah and so by the city council or by the general public by voters also this actually costs money

262
00:23:11,128 --> 00:23:20,631
this is something that, you know, will, you know, actually cost, you know, you know, time and effort.

263
00:23:20,971 --> 00:23:34,295
And I don't think we should lower the number because, you know, this has an impact on the community involvement, you know, getting legal opinions and, you know, putting stuff on on a ballot.

264
00:23:34,475 --> 00:23:35,235
I mean, that

265
00:23:36,426 --> 00:23:54,265
That should be a decent amount of people should be wanting to do so, you know, to lower it is kind of, do you want to make it easy just to bring everything to a vote for, you know, for the general public?

266
00:23:54,425 --> 00:23:58,650
I mean, is that the way we want a method to run?

267
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,921
Well, you know, Anthony, I have to say this.

268
00:24:03,021 --> 00:24:12,444
I agree with you in part about, you know, we have very little civic engagement with the broader community.

269
00:24:13,344 --> 00:24:15,005
And I hear what you're saying, too.

270
00:24:15,065 --> 00:24:16,926
So where do we find the balance, you know?

271
00:24:17,586 --> 00:24:21,927
And I think that's something that we're trying to make this charter

272
00:24:25,607 --> 00:24:32,836
A gift in a way to to the citizens of method, you know, they have a say in how their city operates in this and that and everything.

273
00:24:33,357 --> 00:24:34,778
I don't know the sweet number.

274
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:41,907
But I know everything costs money, but I don't think dropping it by that.

275
00:24:42,368 --> 00:24:44,010
That's that number would.

276
00:24:45,249 --> 00:24:51,354
You know, maybe any financial change, but we may have some more involvement and like you said, and I agree with this unit.

277
00:24:51,734 --> 00:24:53,076
It doesn't make it a frivolous.

278
00:24:53,476 --> 00:24:54,677
There still has to be work.

279
00:24:54,697 --> 00:24:58,360
They have to be really committed to this and really some determination about it.

280
00:25:00,021 --> 00:25:00,562
Okay, Ron.

281
00:25:03,653 --> 00:25:10,518
Yeah, it's my understanding that what this is is it's in the wording.

282
00:25:11,238 --> 00:25:18,503
This puts it on as a motion to be passed by the city council or the school committee.

283
00:25:18,943 --> 00:25:20,024
It's not a citizen vote.

284
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,901
It's not a citizen.

285
00:25:25,961 --> 00:25:26,921
That's the next level.

286
00:25:27,061 --> 00:25:39,525
This is simply to put it on, and it says in the wording, if you look at the big book, it says, City Council cannot change the wording of the measure, the motion.

287
00:25:39,565 --> 00:25:42,486
They must vote on it, yes or no, based on what it is.

288
00:25:43,386 --> 00:25:45,467
Okay, that clarifies.

289
00:25:45,527 --> 00:25:46,747
That's my understanding.

290
00:25:46,787 --> 00:25:47,727
That's my understanding.

291
00:25:51,123 --> 00:25:52,103
Yeah, it passes.

292
00:25:53,584 --> 00:25:54,284
I don't think so.

293
00:25:54,985 --> 00:25:56,105
I think I think so.

294
00:25:56,825 --> 00:26:00,247
I'm just reading through the what section are you on Ron?

295
00:26:05,409 --> 00:26:06,829
Paulette, did you want to say something?

296
00:26:07,349 --> 00:26:14,172
Yeah, so interestingly on this one, I could see going down to 200 signatures, 20 from each ward.

297
00:26:16,853 --> 00:26:18,854
You know, I think that there's

298
00:26:20,215 --> 00:26:28,237
This one is far more challenging than the first one, where the first one was very low.

299
00:26:30,157 --> 00:26:41,260
But this one really, by putting, by necessitating that it's throughout the wards, it definitely makes it more challenging.

300
00:26:41,998 --> 00:26:42,198
Yeah.

301
00:26:42,778 --> 00:26:50,542
And I do think that Aubrey is right that this would eventually, if it went through all the channels, would go on the ballot.

302
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:56,705
This is basically a way to pass an ordinance without the city council, essentially.

303
00:26:56,825 --> 00:26:57,765
That's how I read it.

304
00:26:59,066 --> 00:27:01,447
What if the ordinance has financial impact?

305
00:27:02,168 --> 00:27:04,088
Well, you're not bypassing the council.

306
00:27:04,129 --> 00:27:05,749
It has to go to the council for a vote.

307
00:27:06,109 --> 00:27:06,510
Okay.

308
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:08,911
It's just making sure they are going to accept it.

309
00:27:09,451 --> 00:27:11,112
The city solicitor reviews it.

310
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:27,126
I got to go look through this book, but I think the referendum is what we are talking about, and that does bypass, and then it goes to be vetted by the state, and then it comes back to us for citizen vote.

311
00:27:27,986 --> 00:27:29,847
Paulette, did you have your hand raised?

312
00:27:30,838 --> 00:27:32,740
No, that's my question.

313
00:27:34,161 --> 00:27:36,983
I don't see that this is going to the city council.

314
00:27:37,023 --> 00:27:41,106
This is an initiative measure.

315
00:27:41,186 --> 00:27:47,892
This is giving the citizens the ability to, the mechanism to pass an initiative.

316
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:56,402
But, so the city, it will actually go to the city council.

317
00:27:56,502 --> 00:28:03,264
They can either pass it without change, pass a measure stated to be in lieu of the initiative measure or reject it.

318
00:28:05,804 --> 00:28:08,785
And Ron, go ahead.

319
00:28:10,386 --> 00:28:14,607
Yeah, I'm just reading from the good book here.

320
00:28:15,487 --> 00:28:16,468
It says that,

321
00:28:18,856 --> 00:28:24,686
If the city solicitor determines the petition is in proper form, the city clerk shall provide blank form for use, blah, blah, blah.

322
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:52,789
Within 30 days following the date a petition has been returned to the city clerk or secretary of the school committee, and after publication under subsection F, the city council or the school committee shall act with respect to each initiative petition by passing it without change, by passing a measure which is stated to be in lieu of the initiative measure or by rejecting it.

323
00:28:53,393 --> 00:29:00,077
Yeah, that's section D. But then there's recourse if it's rejected.

324
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:02,779
And that's the next level.

325
00:29:03,099 --> 00:29:04,740
That's the next level.

326
00:29:06,621 --> 00:29:07,641
Go ahead.

327
00:29:07,821 --> 00:29:08,082
No.

328
00:29:09,002 --> 00:29:13,765
No, I just wanted to comment on bringing it down to 200.

329
00:29:14,605 --> 00:29:15,926
It's not only difficult to get the 200.

330
00:29:16,446 --> 00:29:18,788
Remember, you have to go to all eight wards to get that 200.

331
00:29:18,928 --> 00:29:21,269
So it's a process.

332
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:22,250
Yeah.

333
00:29:24,443 --> 00:29:29,144
Okay, so Eunice, did you want to make a motion on that?

334
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:46,007
Yes, a motion to change the petition must be signed by not less than 200 voters and not less than 20 per ward.

335
00:29:46,027 --> 00:29:46,808
Yeah.

336
00:29:48,248 --> 00:29:48,668
Okay.

337
00:29:49,628 --> 00:29:52,069
Before we vote, can I ask one other question?

338
00:29:52,569 --> 00:29:53,289
Oh, go ahead, Anthony.

339
00:29:54,691 --> 00:30:18,690
Just concerning about the wards, in the event that when this goes to the city council and we're not 100% sure that wards are gonna happen, if we put this into effect, this section, would it void it if they decide not to go to a ward

340
00:30:23,607 --> 00:30:24,508
Representation.

341
00:30:24,528 --> 00:30:31,194
I don't think so, because it, um, it's represents that the signatures have to be from around the city.

342
00:30:31,935 --> 00:30:32,736
Go ahead, Danielle.

343
00:30:34,177 --> 00:30:38,461
I guess I would be curious, like, how this, like, some of those cities where the.

344
00:30:40,762 --> 00:31:02,959
like how, or yeah, or like Peabody here, and Waltham, like how, if there's like an example of when this has happened and like what it was like, but also, if like, I know you're saying this would be like for trying to pass ordinances, if it would ever be something that would disproportionately impact one ward over another, so like,

345
00:31:04,598 --> 00:31:11,866
I don't know, so like if you needed 20 signatures from each ward, but really some wards, yeah, I don't know, some wards would be differently impacted.

346
00:31:11,886 --> 00:31:13,628
I hope that would change anything.

347
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:17,412
Okay, yeah.

348
00:31:18,994 --> 00:31:20,135
I mean, ultimately,

349
00:31:21,953 --> 00:31:35,099
It would get voted on by the city council and if the city council rejects it, then the bar to actually get it on the ballot and basically override the city council is pretty high.

350
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:39,580
But Milva, it couldn't go to the city council if it didn't have those numbers.

351
00:31:40,541 --> 00:31:45,283
Well, it could go to the city council with this initial threshold that we're talking about right now.

352
00:31:47,948 --> 00:31:52,690
Yeah, I don't think, that's not what I heard Danielle saying though, but I may be mishearing.

353
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:56,091
No, no, I think, go ahead.

354
00:31:57,011 --> 00:32:16,298
That seems to be the point that we're like kind of trying to clarify is that it would like, so these citizens could get this petition signed and that would bring like a motion in front of the city council or like a proposal in front of the city council or a school committee and they would have to approve it for it to go to a citizen vote, right?

355
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:20,846
No, I think if they approve it, then it passes as an ordinance.

356
00:32:21,687 --> 00:32:35,862
And if they reject it, then the people who started it can try to get it passed again by using the next level of signatures and then a ballot on the ballot.

357
00:32:36,623 --> 00:32:36,803
Ron?

358
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,781
You just didn't know one more question, though, sorry.

359
00:32:42,281 --> 00:32:42,881
Oh, OK.

360
00:32:43,421 --> 00:32:51,363
How many how many signatures do you need for like to when you're trying to run for office for like city council or school committee?

361
00:32:52,403 --> 00:32:53,124
Like a hundred.

362
00:32:53,864 --> 00:32:55,144
I thought it was.

363
00:32:55,344 --> 00:32:56,784
I thought it was 50, but it might be 100.

364
00:32:57,124 --> 00:32:57,445
It might be 100.

365
00:32:57,485 --> 00:32:57,525
OK.

366
00:32:57,585 --> 00:32:59,045
OK, thank you.

367
00:32:59,525 --> 00:33:01,706
I think I don't think it's more than 50 or 100, though.

368
00:33:01,866 --> 00:33:02,526
Yeah.

369
00:33:02,686 --> 00:33:05,747
And maybe for mayor, it's a little bit more, but it's you know, it's pretty low bar.

370
00:33:05,787 --> 00:33:06,107
OK, great.

371
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:12,287
Yeah, and we did that in the elections, Article 7.

372
00:33:13,709 --> 00:33:15,132
Ron, did you want to say something?

373
00:33:15,292 --> 00:33:16,914
Yeah, just to Danielle's question.

374
00:33:16,934 --> 00:33:22,102
I think it's more reasonable to believe that list on the side there that Malden's 3 means 3%.

375
00:33:24,214 --> 00:33:25,255
Maybe, maybe.

376
00:33:25,515 --> 00:33:27,096
I think those are just misprints.

377
00:33:27,676 --> 00:33:28,377
I think that means 3%.

378
00:33:29,037 --> 00:33:37,103
You can't imagine motion after motion if you need you, your wife, and your oldest son to have a motion.

379
00:33:37,463 --> 00:33:38,163
It's got to be 3%.

380
00:33:38,203 --> 00:33:39,824
That makes sense.

381
00:33:40,145 --> 00:33:50,772
To your other point, Danielle, about those petitions that affect a certain ward, unfortunately, the way we function as a city,

382
00:33:51,706 --> 00:33:53,987
We do the whole city when we're talking about ordinance.

383
00:33:54,067 --> 00:33:56,849
It's not like you can just say that Ward six gets this.

384
00:33:56,909 --> 00:34:02,672
And I understand what you're saying, but you really have to drive the whole city to me because you could be spending money too.

385
00:34:04,433 --> 00:34:04,773
Thank you.

386
00:34:05,693 --> 00:34:05,873
Yeah.

387
00:34:06,034 --> 00:34:06,414
Okay.

388
00:34:06,674 --> 00:34:08,935
Um, so Eunice made a motion.

389
00:34:09,015 --> 00:34:09,916
Did we have a second?

390
00:34:09,936 --> 00:34:13,357
Did Anthony get his question answered?

391
00:34:14,478 --> 00:34:15,138
Oh, pretty much.

392
00:34:15,338 --> 00:34:15,839
Pretty much.

393
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,300
I understand a little bit better now.

394
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:31,250
Okay, so the motion on the table is to lower the threshold for commencement of an initiative petition to 200 voters, at least 20 from each ward.

395
00:34:33,231 --> 00:34:35,413
So, Eunice.

396
00:34:36,354 --> 00:34:36,614
Yes.

397
00:34:37,815 --> 00:34:38,876
Did somebody second this?

398
00:34:39,436 --> 00:34:39,897
Yes.

399
00:34:40,657 --> 00:34:41,238
Okay.

400
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:42,499
Ron.

401
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:45,421
Yes.

402
00:34:45,521 --> 00:34:45,862
Anthony.

403
00:34:47,183 --> 00:34:47,423
Yes.

404
00:34:49,437 --> 00:34:49,837
Paulette.

405
00:34:50,457 --> 00:34:50,717
Yes.

406
00:34:52,318 --> 00:34:52,678
Aubrey.

407
00:34:53,078 --> 00:34:53,298
Yes.

408
00:34:54,838 --> 00:34:55,238
Danielle.

409
00:34:55,978 --> 00:34:56,218
Yes.

410
00:34:57,619 --> 00:34:59,919
Who am I missing?

411
00:35:00,739 --> 00:35:01,159
Phyllis.

412
00:35:01,739 --> 00:35:04,420
Yes.

413
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,520
I will vote yes.

414
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:06,380
I think that's everybody.

415
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:06,880
Did I miss?

416
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:07,860
No.

417
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:08,841
Okay, great.

418
00:35:08,861 --> 00:35:12,321
You got everyone.

419
00:35:12,701 --> 00:35:13,841
The next level is,

420
00:35:17,518 --> 00:35:28,847
Let's see, there was something in the 10%.

421
00:35:30,489 --> 00:35:34,452
I think, Eunice, you don't have any notes on this one, right?

422
00:35:35,373 --> 00:35:38,755
No, and I'm trying to just quickly read through it.

423
00:35:38,835 --> 00:35:46,722
I mean, I think everywhere we go, I'd like to lower things a little bit for the reasons that I've previously stated.

424
00:35:47,435 --> 00:36:08,106
Number of the noted is following the date of the blank forms are issued by the Senate, shall be returned if I was signed by not less than 10% of the total number of voters as of the date of, so what is, so if we were to do something today, what would we be looking at?

425
00:36:08,707 --> 00:36:12,249
I don't know the exact number, but I think it's approximately 40,000.

426
00:36:12,669 --> 00:36:14,370
Does that sound right to anybody who?

427
00:36:16,195 --> 00:36:19,998
I think that's approximately the number of registered voters.

428
00:36:20,318 --> 00:36:25,262
I think it's really about 30,000 in actuality.

429
00:36:25,322 --> 00:36:35,630
I think those are names that have not come off the list of prior residents and people who attended school here and stuff.

430
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:37,571
When they talk about 13,000 voters being a 30 percent of, I guess,

431
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:46,451
I don't know.

432
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:47,892
I've been speaking out of school.

433
00:36:47,932 --> 00:36:58,621
I don't know 100%, but I thought I heard somebody say that it was 31 or 33,000 of actual registered active voters.

434
00:36:58,681 --> 00:37:01,964
But I do have a question.

435
00:37:03,025 --> 00:37:05,307
What is it now for the city?

436
00:37:05,327 --> 00:37:10,272
I thought it was just something where 10 people can petition the city council

437
00:37:12,992 --> 00:37:17,315
What are the requirements now to get something on the ballot?

438
00:37:17,555 --> 00:37:18,576
Or to be heard?

439
00:37:19,116 --> 00:37:19,316
Or?

440
00:37:20,117 --> 00:37:21,558
We don't have anything in the charter.

441
00:37:21,578 --> 00:37:23,980
It would have to be based on mass general laws.

442
00:37:25,481 --> 00:37:25,841
Right.

443
00:37:25,941 --> 00:37:33,147
But I know that when I recently I was told that, oh, get nine of your friends and you can get something.

444
00:37:39,144 --> 00:37:53,703
Is it a motion or is it a both bodies have different procedures, different protocols to be heard in front of them.

445
00:37:55,468 --> 00:38:04,397
With I think city council being a little bit less stringent than school committee currently.

446
00:38:04,417 --> 00:38:12,446
So, yeah, you know, at city council meetings, I mean, you can get up at the end of the meeting.

447
00:38:13,247 --> 00:38:15,489
They have a public participation section and you can.

448
00:38:16,596 --> 00:38:28,204
get up and talk about whatever's on your mind, you know, as long as it's within their purview, school committee, there's a different set of protocols.

449
00:38:29,024 --> 00:38:34,108
So, you know, but I'm not quite sure if that answered your question.

450
00:38:34,648 --> 00:38:45,856
You know, but I thought it was, you only needed 10 signatures to get something put in front of this city council to get on,

451
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:58,456
You know, for a citywide vote, they and the mayor would have to approve it, but then it would go to the state, and then it could go on the ballot.

452
00:38:58,476 --> 00:39:01,137
I only thought it was required 10 signatures.

453
00:39:01,497 --> 00:39:03,278
Am I crazy, or is that?

454
00:39:03,718 --> 00:39:04,539
I don't know.

455
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:06,620
I'm not aware of that.

456
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:12,823
There is part of the process, Anthony, is if you are getting all your signatures together,

457
00:39:13,695 --> 00:39:17,897
they take the top 10 voters to give the petitions to.

458
00:39:18,598 --> 00:39:19,759
Maybe that's what you understood.

459
00:39:19,779 --> 00:39:21,840
I remember.

460
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:25,602
OK, Danielle, did you have something you wanted to ask or say?

461
00:39:28,383 --> 00:39:28,864
Danielle?

462
00:39:30,454 --> 00:39:30,795
No, sorry.

463
00:39:30,815 --> 00:39:31,355
Is my hand up?

464
00:39:31,455 --> 00:39:31,975
Sorry.

465
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:34,177
Yeah.

466
00:39:34,537 --> 00:39:45,486
It looks like I'm just looking at the official election results from the presidential primary a couple of months ago and the registered registered voters.

467
00:39:45,506 --> 00:39:47,448
And I think it goes by.

468
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:49,890
I think the walls need to be purged.

469
00:39:51,211 --> 00:39:57,235
From what I've heard, but I think it goes by what they have on their roles now, and it's a little over 42,000.

470
00:39:57,275 --> 00:39:58,576
That's about right.

471
00:39:58,777 --> 00:39:59,777
Then we'd be looking at.

472
00:39:59,797 --> 00:39:59,897
About 4,200.

473
00:39:59,937 --> 00:40:00,098
Right.

474
00:40:00,118 --> 00:40:00,858
Which is a big lift, very big lift.

475
00:40:01,238 --> 00:40:01,359
Right.

476
00:40:01,379 --> 00:40:03,220
If we would drop it down to 5 percent, we'd be looking at about 2,400.

477
00:40:20,198 --> 00:40:20,279
Um,

478
00:40:22,635 --> 00:40:26,136
Let's say something to Anthony for a minute while you're thinking there for a minute.

479
00:40:26,256 --> 00:40:49,463
Anthony, under section C, it talks about when something's submitted to the clerk and if the petition is in proper form, the city clerk should provide blank forms for the use of the subsequent signers and shall print at the time of each blank form a fair, concise summary of the proposed measure as determined by the facility, together with the names and addresses of the first 10 voters who signed the originating petition.

480
00:40:50,263 --> 00:40:51,944
That's where I remember that 10 vote.

481
00:40:52,164 --> 00:40:52,645
Okay.

482
00:40:53,105 --> 00:40:54,546
Okay.

483
00:40:54,586 --> 00:40:54,986
Thank you.

484
00:40:55,366 --> 00:40:56,227
Yeah, that's okay.

485
00:40:56,407 --> 00:40:56,847
That's okay.

486
00:40:56,927 --> 00:40:57,287
Okay.

487
00:40:57,448 --> 00:41:01,650
So Eunice, are you wanting to lower the 10%?

488
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:03,351
Yeah.

489
00:41:05,353 --> 00:41:08,114
How do people feel about dropping it all the way down to five?

490
00:41:09,815 --> 00:41:10,656
So that would be about 2400.

491
00:41:12,937 --> 00:41:17,060
If we were to, if you know, you wanted to do something like this tomorrow.

492
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:23,651
Does anybody want to second that?

493
00:41:23,671 --> 00:41:28,576
I just want another clarification on the process.

494
00:41:28,956 --> 00:41:44,469
So the people, the clerk, first you would go to the city council, then... No, this is even before the city council.

495
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:55,946
The commencement will require 200 signatures, then the city solicitor says yes or no, this is legal or okay.

496
00:41:56,807 --> 00:42:10,915
Then once the city solicitor says it's in a proper form, the clerk gives new forms to get signed by 10 percent, but the proposal is to lower it to five percent.

497
00:42:11,996 --> 00:42:26,327
So basically you need the 200 signatures, as I proposed, and 20 from each ward to get it to the clerk, to get it to the solicitor, to look at it, to bless it.

498
00:42:27,268 --> 00:42:43,654
And then once the solicitor is whatever it is that you want to do, then you go back to the city clerk and he provides you with forms to go back out and get X amount of.

499
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:46,631
signatures from the most recent voters.

500
00:42:47,592 --> 00:42:54,716
And then after that, and then they can be, there would be action on the petitions with the city council and the school committee.

501
00:42:54,776 --> 00:42:59,499
So just so, so it's, it's pretty high threshold to do this.

502
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:00,740
Uh, Paula.

503
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:01,241
Yeah.

504
00:43:01,261 --> 00:43:07,665
Could you just go back to the one, the paragraph before this, the commencement or the referral?

505
00:43:07,685 --> 00:43:08,065
No, no.

506
00:43:08,125 --> 00:43:09,846
The sec, the B. Okay.

507
00:43:19,306 --> 00:43:27,913
So you're having the city solicitor inform the school committee whether it's lawful.

508
00:43:28,153 --> 00:43:33,678
So it's clear in A, role of the school committee.

509
00:43:34,038 --> 00:43:42,725
We get to B, and all of a sudden you have the city solicitor informing the school committee while the school committee has its own lawyer.

510
00:43:45,207 --> 00:43:45,368
So-

511
00:43:47,333 --> 00:44:01,690
So I'm just trying to wonder about the distinction between having the city solicitor inform the school committee when it, would it be the city solicitor for the school committee or would it be the legal counsel of the school committee?

512
00:44:03,112 --> 00:44:05,655
This would be the first time the school committee is hearing about it.

513
00:44:07,157 --> 00:44:15,902
If I was interested in, I'd go get my 2200 signatures, come to the city solicitor, and then they would tell me whether it's legal or not.

514
00:44:15,962 --> 00:44:18,223
And if it is, then the school committee would hear about it.

515
00:44:20,344 --> 00:44:20,725
Okay.

516
00:44:21,245 --> 00:44:24,487
After it's been deemed possible.

517
00:44:25,287 --> 00:44:32,591
All right, so then we get down to C. And again, I'm just looking for that, what the school committee portion is.

518
00:44:33,252 --> 00:44:35,413
I understand it all in terms of the city councilor.

519
00:44:40,644 --> 00:44:58,036
Yeah, so if the city solicitor says that this is okay, this is in proper form, then the signers go, or the people who are trying to get this to pass, go out and get 10% or Unisys proposing 5%.

520
00:44:58,096 --> 00:44:59,477
Right, right.

521
00:44:59,517 --> 00:45:01,178
No, I understand that part.

522
00:45:01,238 --> 00:45:07,163
I'm just saying, it's the city clerk shall provide blank forms for the use of subsequent signers.

523
00:45:09,702 --> 00:45:23,033
So you're saying it doesn't matter that there's a separate legal counsel for the school committee in terms of collecting signatures, doing it all under the city clerk is okay?

524
00:45:27,297 --> 00:45:28,658
Okay.

525
00:45:29,398 --> 00:45:31,699
Someone else has their hand up.

526
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:32,940
Ron.

527
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,741
I hear what you're saying, Paulette.

528
00:45:34,841 --> 00:45:41,264
I think the fact that there's a collection of signatures, it falls under the purview of the city clerk, who falls under the purview of the city solicitor.

529
00:45:41,284 --> 00:45:47,107
But certainly, we should ask an opinion on the role of the school committee legal counsel as well.

530
00:45:48,667 --> 00:45:56,031
I don't think anybody here can speak to what that role is in terms of who makes the final say for the school committee.

531
00:45:57,955 --> 00:45:59,796
Okay.

532
00:46:00,777 --> 00:46:11,801
Before we go, I'm going to need an example, just because I'm very confused on what happens, what part in the process.

533
00:46:13,202 --> 00:46:25,147
Just for example, just say I wanted to have backyard chickens, and I go get the, what did we come up for the number of signatures? 200.

534
00:46:26,918 --> 00:46:30,882
200 people say we want backyard chickens.

535
00:46:31,583 --> 00:46:35,788
Okay and that goes on the ballot that that goes to the city council?

536
00:46:36,408 --> 00:46:41,374
No, first the city solicitor looks at it and determines whether it's legal.

537
00:46:41,394 --> 00:46:43,676
The chickens are okay, okay.

538
00:46:43,716 --> 00:46:45,378
So the solicitor says okay

539
00:46:46,873 --> 00:46:49,394
You can ask to have chickens.

540
00:46:49,474 --> 00:46:58,641
Then you go to the next level of what we are talking about now, the 10 percent and the proposal on the table is to lower that to 5 percent.

541
00:46:59,221 --> 00:47:02,444
Then you have to get all those signatures before it goes to the city council.

542
00:47:04,025 --> 00:47:07,247
You need 2,500 signatures to get?

543
00:47:07,848 --> 00:47:13,692
As of now, it would be more like 4,200, but Eunice is proposing it be lowered to about 2,000.

544
00:47:17,158 --> 00:47:23,960
And that 4,200 signatures, if I got 4,200 signatures, what happens?

545
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:26,040
It goes to the city council.

546
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:30,781
They either vote it and then it becomes an ordinance or they vote it down.

547
00:47:31,441 --> 00:47:41,743
And then it's either it's over or the charter, as it's proposed, gives the option of collecting still more signatures to get it on the ballot.

548
00:47:42,844 --> 00:47:48,327
but that's the next level, so we haven't gotten there yet, and we have a lot to get through in this section, so.

549
00:47:48,527 --> 00:47:48,847
Okay.

550
00:47:49,688 --> 00:47:53,130
All right, I just tried to wrap my head around it.

551
00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:55,051
Yeah, yeah, gotcha.

552
00:47:55,591 --> 00:48:02,836
So, Eunice made a motion to lower the thresholds for Section C of the initiative petition from 10% to 5%.

553
00:48:02,896 --> 00:48:05,497
Did somebody second?

554
00:48:05,537 --> 00:48:05,817
Second.

555
00:48:07,724 --> 00:48:11,205
Would it make sense in order to help with the school committee piece?

556
00:48:11,586 --> 00:48:13,607
Would it make sense to divide this.

557
00:48:14,427 --> 00:48:22,370
Out not changing the numbers per se, leaving the thresholds as we decide, but.

558
00:48:24,051 --> 00:48:25,812
To divide it out so that.

559
00:48:26,872 --> 00:48:35,019
The city council goes, if you're dealing with the city council, you go through the clerk and the solicitor.

560
00:48:35,039 --> 00:48:38,502
And if you're putting something forth.

561
00:48:39,635 --> 00:48:49,943
to the school committee, you're dealing with, you know, somebody in the superintendent's office, whoever it is, it's appropriate.

562
00:48:49,963 --> 00:48:54,667
And then going to the- Well, we didn't see that in any of the other charters we looked at.

563
00:48:54,687 --> 00:49:01,793
And I, you know, I think if it were a problem, the call and tender will flag it, but we didn't see that.

564
00:49:01,813 --> 00:49:03,194
We didn't see that distinction.

565
00:49:03,534 --> 00:49:03,794
So.

566
00:49:04,795 --> 00:49:05,215
Okay.

567
00:49:05,235 --> 00:49:07,097
So we'll just leave it as it is and see.

568
00:49:08,158 --> 00:49:08,338
I mean,

569
00:49:11,315 --> 00:49:15,317
Okay, so now we're going to vote on lowering this from 10% to 5%.

570
00:49:15,677 --> 00:49:17,058
Eunice?

571
00:49:18,179 --> 00:49:18,419
Yes.

572
00:49:19,399 --> 00:49:19,779
Ron?

573
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:24,081
No.

574
00:49:24,182 --> 00:49:24,622
Paulette?

575
00:49:26,062 --> 00:49:26,343
Yes.

576
00:49:27,843 --> 00:49:28,284
Danielle?

577
00:49:28,884 --> 00:49:29,144
Yes.

578
00:49:30,165 --> 00:49:30,525
Aubrey?

579
00:49:32,085 --> 00:49:34,127
Yes.

580
00:49:34,307 --> 00:49:34,707
Anthony?

581
00:49:36,108 --> 00:49:36,348
Yes.

582
00:49:39,289 --> 00:49:39,609
Phyllis?

583
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:40,790
Yes.

584
00:49:42,412 --> 00:49:45,935
Um, I will also vote yes.

585
00:49:45,955 --> 00:49:48,778
So this is down to five.

586
00:49:48,798 --> 00:49:51,420
Okay.

587
00:49:52,683 --> 00:50:05,672
The next threshold, this is basically saying that if the petition, if the people get the signatures, then the city council and school committee have to act on it.

588
00:50:06,593 --> 00:50:17,160
And this next threshold is if they vote it down and it's rejected, then not more than 60 days later, there's an opportunity to do a supplementary petition.

589
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:19,282
Paulette, did you have your hand raised?

590
00:50:20,118 --> 00:50:26,145
Sorry, no, no, I'm basically saying that people have the right to come back to resubmit it.

591
00:50:27,987 --> 00:50:32,132
And perhaps making some changes to see if they can make it fly.

592
00:50:32,953 --> 00:50:40,161
Yeah, so these numbers we probably do these and they were also sort of based on the number before, so they would have to get.

593
00:50:42,066 --> 00:50:51,372
Additional voters that are not five, that is not a number of additional voters, not less than 5% of the total number of voters as of the date of the most recent city election.

594
00:50:54,915 --> 00:51:04,361
And when you add up the signatures from C, which was 10, but is now five, and this, you get not less than 15%.

595
00:51:04,401 --> 00:51:11,065
So the total threshold is 15%, but that includes the signatures that have already been elected.

596
00:51:15,285 --> 00:51:17,366
So does this need to change to?

597
00:51:17,746 --> 00:51:28,809
Well, either it has to change to at least as little as 10, we just have to automatically change that because we changed the other by five.

598
00:51:28,889 --> 00:51:36,712
So we've already lowered this effectively with our last vote.

599
00:51:38,310 --> 00:51:50,933
So this would mean that in order to override a no vote, you would have to, your total number that you end up having to get would be at about 4,200.

600
00:51:51,313 --> 00:51:54,233
Which is significant.

601
00:51:54,854 --> 00:51:56,574
It is significant, yes.

602
00:51:58,954 --> 00:52:02,075
I'm just trying to figure out if we need to lower the five too.

603
00:52:09,712 --> 00:52:11,553
I don't, I don't know.

604
00:52:11,573 --> 00:52:20,599
Because, you know, we want the numbers to.

605
00:52:20,619 --> 00:52:23,180
I think, I think the numbers will be okay.

606
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:30,305
I think the reason that before we had 10% and then we have five and 15 maybe to give a little leeway.

607
00:52:33,046 --> 00:52:34,407
But, all right.

608
00:52:36,910 --> 00:52:44,072
And then what happens is if those signatures are collected, it would go on the ballot.

609
00:52:46,193 --> 00:52:49,294
Do things don't automatically go on the ballot though?

610
00:52:50,194 --> 00:52:50,434
No.

611
00:52:50,534 --> 00:52:56,356
They have to go, doesn't the mayor have to, doesn't it go to the state?

612
00:52:56,636 --> 00:52:59,557
Things just don't go on the ballot, right?

613
00:53:01,018 --> 00:53:05,299
This could, this is not, yes, in this case,

614
00:53:06,847 --> 00:53:09,789
Yes, but this is just for a municipal ordinance.

615
00:53:10,649 --> 00:53:19,034
And the city solicitor will have reviewed it to see if it's something that could do that.

616
00:53:21,436 --> 00:53:26,959
So I think, are we in agreement that we don't need to make any changes to this or does anybody wanna change these numbers?

617
00:53:27,899 --> 00:53:29,260
I still have another question.

618
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:34,123
So in the case of the school committee, what type of thing can

619
00:53:34,536 --> 00:53:39,318
you know, 10% of the population kind of change?

620
00:53:40,138 --> 00:53:41,239
Well, that's a good question.

621
00:53:41,299 --> 00:53:42,919
And I don't really know.

622
00:53:42,939 --> 00:53:55,805
I mean, I think that probably it's very limited because schools are so, you know, they're very regulated, and there's a lot of laws about how they operate.

623
00:53:55,825 --> 00:53:59,166
So I think it's probably a limited power anyway.

624
00:54:04,928 --> 00:54:13,213
But school committee makes policy, so it could be, you know, if it's the will of the people, a change in policy.

625
00:54:14,493 --> 00:54:26,500
So if, say, 10% of the population wants to ban certain books in the schools, they could do it with 10% of the population?

626
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:27,780
I don't know.

627
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:28,921
10% of the voters?

628
00:54:29,581 --> 00:54:31,202
It would depend on the ballot, right?

629
00:54:32,083 --> 00:54:32,483
I'm sorry?

630
00:54:33,885 --> 00:54:37,489
10% of the population could put it on the ballot.

631
00:54:37,529 --> 00:54:38,830
Put it on the ballot, yes.

632
00:54:39,091 --> 00:54:41,473
It would still have to get voted on by all the people in the city.

633
00:54:43,195 --> 00:54:50,102
Right, but to get something on the ballot, doesn't it have to go through the school committee, the mayor, and the state?

634
00:54:51,192 --> 00:54:59,561
No, we're putting a mechanism in the charter so that people can do that.

635
00:54:59,841 --> 00:55:01,783
It's a process.

636
00:55:01,823 --> 00:55:02,564
It's not easy.

637
00:55:03,565 --> 00:55:13,295
Anthony raises a really good question because if it's something very destructive, what you're saying is a small minority of the city could push it.

638
00:55:15,364 --> 00:55:17,527
But the majority of people would still have to vote on it.

639
00:55:18,208 --> 00:55:31,127
And I don't know, the city solicitor would have to have said, yes, this would be a legal ordinance or policy.

640
00:55:31,667 --> 00:55:31,848
Ron?

641
00:55:33,038 --> 00:55:37,360
Yeah, and all of this has to be washed against Massachusetts general laws.

642
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:39,881
And it's the school committee side.

643
00:55:40,301 --> 00:55:47,565
Department of Education, as Paulette clearly knows, you don't have a lot of power to change what they're doing at the state level.

644
00:55:47,645 --> 00:55:55,108
So these things would all be washed against a very, very strict, much more strict than the city side, the school side.

645
00:55:55,128 --> 00:55:56,049
Would you agree, Paulette?

646
00:55:58,205 --> 00:56:05,350
Yes, yeah, and I think that would be the job of the city solicitor to ensure there's no conflicts, right?

647
00:56:05,390 --> 00:56:16,118
I think I envision the city clerk would I mean, the city solicitor would be the legal authority, but would have to work in conjunction with the school side legal council as well.

648
00:56:17,479 --> 00:56:18,940
It's a very, very difficult thing.

649
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:27,067
And as we know, you cannot change education because that is a much broader laws that affect you.

650
00:56:27,147 --> 00:56:29,689
Going inside the detail of those is a lot harder.

651
00:56:30,950 --> 00:56:31,210
Yes.

652
00:56:32,551 --> 00:56:32,891
Okay.

653
00:56:32,971 --> 00:56:35,834
So the next section is even more complex.

654
00:56:36,214 --> 00:56:39,197
And this is about citizen referendums.

655
00:56:39,817 --> 00:56:40,698
So this

656
00:56:46,350 --> 00:56:53,059
would basically allow you to protest an ordinance or a measure that was passed, right?

657
00:56:53,079 --> 00:56:56,104
Is that what you're recalling, Ron and Eunice?

658
00:56:58,827 --> 00:56:59,448
I think so.

659
00:56:59,889 --> 00:57:01,832
Yeah, it's protesting against a measure.

660
00:57:02,507 --> 00:57:19,239
So this section, if not more than 21 days following the date on which the city council and school committee votes to approve of a measure, a position signed by a number of voters amounting to not less than, as of now, 12% protest the measure.

661
00:57:19,819 --> 00:57:21,320
So what did my research say?

662
00:57:22,741 --> 00:57:24,002
These are high thresholds.

663
00:57:25,884 --> 00:57:28,365
We're already on the low end, very low end.

664
00:57:28,926 --> 00:57:29,166
Yeah.

665
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:37,774
But 12% is... Probably getting up there to 5,000.

666
00:57:37,814 --> 00:57:38,755
5,000, yeah.

667
00:57:39,095 --> 00:57:48,302
So what this is saying is that 5,000 signatures can temporarily suspend an ordinance, right?

668
00:57:49,783 --> 00:57:55,388
So what did my... I think my research is probably a little bit further down, because... Is this it right here?

669
00:57:55,408 --> 00:57:56,909
Each section?

670
00:57:57,509 --> 00:57:58,590
No, that's number of days.

671
00:57:58,610 --> 00:57:59,151
Oh, sorry.

672
00:58:01,236 --> 00:58:03,057
Oh, sorry, wait, I don't see it here.

673
00:58:04,097 --> 00:58:05,517
Did you, maybe you didn't.

674
00:58:09,558 --> 00:58:13,679
Section, number of days for a petition to reconsider to be put forth.

675
00:58:13,779 --> 00:58:17,260
Okay, so we have not more than 21.

676
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:20,561
So we're pretty much- You're on the money there.

677
00:58:20,901 --> 00:58:24,102
You're on the money there, but we don't know about the 12%, but 12% would come out to about,

678
00:58:29,857 --> 00:58:31,798
6,000 is my math.

679
00:58:32,018 --> 00:58:33,138
I mean, my head is, 10% is 4,000.

680
00:58:33,178 --> 00:58:36,040
I think I have the data in the other room.

681
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:36,540
It's about 4,500.

682
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:36,920
Ron.

683
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:39,261
Are we carrying down the ward requirement in these boats?

684
00:58:39,301 --> 00:58:40,222
I don't think so.

685
00:58:40,242 --> 00:58:41,622
I mean, I think these numbers are so high that

686
00:58:57,904 --> 00:58:58,224
Okay.

687
00:58:58,805 --> 00:59:03,208
Even like, even making the clerk, that might be hard.

688
00:59:03,448 --> 00:59:04,969
I don't know.

689
00:59:05,109 --> 00:59:05,289
Okay.

690
00:59:05,309 --> 00:59:05,690
I agree.

691
00:59:06,170 --> 00:59:06,470
Yeah.

692
00:59:06,850 --> 00:59:07,191
Okay.

693
00:59:07,251 --> 00:59:07,671
Paulette?

694
00:59:08,632 --> 00:59:09,032
Okay.

695
00:59:09,252 --> 00:59:20,920
So let's suppose, I mean, I'm not sure this is what we're talking about potentially, but, you know, a couple of years ago, there was that big issue about naming a school, which will strike some closer.

696
00:59:21,021 --> 00:59:25,524
Are we saying that then if people get,

697
00:59:28,726 --> 00:59:29,548
Let's see, where was it?

698
00:59:29,568 --> 00:59:34,358
12% of the total number of voters.

699
00:59:40,148 --> 00:59:44,650
that because it said shall immediately reconsider its vote on the measure or part of it.

700
00:59:45,250 --> 00:59:52,574
If the measure is not rescinded, the city council should provide for the submission of the question for determination by the voters at a special election.

701
00:59:52,674 --> 01:00:00,738
So are we saying that the power of the school committee to name a school would be taken away

702
01:00:01,905 --> 01:00:05,109
from the school committee and given to the voters?

703
01:00:05,409 --> 01:00:08,793
Is that what we're saying in this?

704
01:00:09,974 --> 01:00:21,407
We are saying that the people could, I don't know if, like I said, all of this would have to be

705
01:00:25,458 --> 01:00:27,019
eligible for that, right?

706
01:00:27,159 --> 01:00:32,622
So it could be that, but I think, I think the answer is yes, more or less.

707
01:00:32,922 --> 01:00:33,162
Yeah.

708
01:00:33,763 --> 01:00:34,783
It says suspend.

709
01:00:34,883 --> 01:00:38,725
So like, would that mean it would just like stop that from happening?

710
01:00:38,745 --> 01:00:39,546
It wouldn't be.

711
01:00:40,066 --> 01:00:48,631
It would be temporarily suspended and then the body would reconsider its vote and choose to rescind it or not.

712
01:00:48,731 --> 01:00:53,854
And if they don't rescind it, then it goes to the voters at a special election.

713
01:00:56,190 --> 01:00:58,891
or at the next regular city election.

714
01:01:01,031 --> 01:01:11,533
So it looks like for section A, where we have the 12%, I guess somehow my research vaporized from the right-hand side there.

715
01:01:11,613 --> 01:01:14,733
But fortunately, I wrote it down.

716
01:01:15,073 --> 01:01:15,594
Excellent.

717
01:01:16,874 --> 01:01:18,574
In the pile of papers I have here.

718
01:01:19,174 --> 01:01:22,875
So section A, total signatures of registered voters.

719
01:01:23,795 --> 01:01:46,628
with the dozen communities that I looked at, you've got one at five percent, which is Newton, a couple at 10 percent, which was Methuen and Framingham, several at 12 percent, and a couple at 15 percent.

720
01:01:52,873 --> 01:02:13,248
okay and newton as we've uh newton's thresholds have been uh on the low end it seems uh for other things as well i mean we could drop it to 10 and still be in the ballpark with methuen framingham i guess those are the two um there were

721
01:02:18,398 --> 01:02:34,630
There was the one outlier at Newton, Taunton and Weymouth were at 15 percent, and Methuen and Framingham at 10, and then probably a good six or seven at 12 percent.

722
01:02:35,470 --> 01:02:37,332
We could drop it to 10 and still be.

723
01:02:42,475 --> 01:02:44,697
Is that what you want to make a motion on?

724
01:02:47,479 --> 01:02:49,280
Uh, where are we now?

725
01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:50,060
We're 12%.

726
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:56,962
Um, yeah, I'd make a motion for 10% because that gives us about 4200.

727
01:02:57,082 --> 01:03:03,083
I mean, we've talked about that being a high threshold, but we're at, you know, the 3rd tier now.

728
01:03:03,243 --> 01:03:04,644
So, you know, it.

729
01:03:06,944 --> 01:03:09,525
It needs to be possible, but not, you know.

730
01:03:10,863 --> 01:03:13,785
Hopefully, the other two tiers would have taken care of some things.

731
01:03:14,565 --> 01:03:18,107
But if we're here, then it needs to require a bit more work.

732
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:21,288
So I'm voting for 10 percent.

733
01:03:21,608 --> 01:03:22,529
Does anybody second?

734
01:03:26,330 --> 01:03:26,891
I'll second it.

735
01:03:29,352 --> 01:03:29,652
Eunice?

736
01:03:30,592 --> 01:03:30,753
Yes.

737
01:03:31,513 --> 01:03:31,873
Ron?

738
01:03:33,254 --> 01:03:33,474
No.

739
01:03:34,915 --> 01:03:35,355
Paulette?

740
01:03:38,156 --> 01:03:39,517
No.

741
01:03:39,817 --> 01:03:40,097
Aubrey?

742
01:03:44,917 --> 01:03:45,498
I think yes.

743
01:03:47,299 --> 01:03:47,959
Anthony?

744
01:03:49,621 --> 01:03:51,602
No.

745
01:03:51,922 --> 01:03:52,303
Phyllis?

746
01:03:55,305 --> 01:03:55,485
No.

747
01:03:57,166 --> 01:04:00,389
And I'm missing one person.

748
01:04:00,409 --> 01:04:01,289
That's me.

749
01:04:01,309 --> 01:04:02,150
Danielle.

750
01:04:02,170 --> 01:04:03,251
Danielle, thank you.

751
01:04:03,271 --> 01:04:04,032
Danielle.

752
01:04:04,692 --> 01:04:05,292
I'm a no, yeah.

753
01:04:05,893 --> 01:04:07,754
Okay, I'm also going to be no on this one.

754
01:04:08,135 --> 01:04:10,136
Okay, so this one is going to stay at 12%.

755
01:04:14,048 --> 01:04:19,951
Okay, there's also a bunch of this whole section about ineligible measures.

756
01:04:22,372 --> 01:04:29,595
And which outlines things that this provision cannot be used for.

757
01:04:32,396 --> 01:04:34,357
Okay, now we come to the biggie recall.

758
01:04:37,218 --> 01:04:48,384
So, you know, the subcommittee had a pretty long discussions about recall, but there was agreements that we wanted to include recall provisions.

759
01:04:50,405 --> 01:04:58,070
So, does anybody have any proposals on this section or thoughts or questions?

760
01:05:01,094 --> 01:05:03,576
Eunice, is your hand up?

761
01:05:03,837 --> 01:05:04,137
Sorry.

762
01:05:04,777 --> 01:05:06,979
Okay, that's okay.

763
01:05:09,001 --> 01:05:10,423
So we're all good with the recall section?

764
01:05:11,684 --> 01:05:14,446
Yeah, I think I'm mostly okay with this.

765
01:05:15,767 --> 01:05:21,673
You know, we had a long discussion, as you said, about this, and I think we made it so that

766
01:05:23,673 --> 01:05:27,955
it was difficult but doable as it should be.

767
01:05:28,496 --> 01:05:30,357
Yes.

768
01:05:30,377 --> 01:05:35,659
I think there was one comment that Jean made.

769
01:05:35,679 --> 01:05:37,220
Yeah, down the bottom there.

770
01:05:39,902 --> 01:05:41,142
That was a while ago.

771
01:05:41,162 --> 01:05:43,303
Do you remember if we discussed that in our subcommittee?

772
01:05:44,224 --> 01:05:45,424
I feel like we did.

773
01:05:45,445 --> 01:05:49,707
Yeah, I remember us talking about it.

774
01:05:49,727 --> 01:05:50,747
Yeah.

775
01:05:50,827 --> 01:05:51,588
I don't remember.

776
01:05:52,736 --> 01:05:55,237
I think we were, I think we, I think we resolved it anyway.

777
01:05:55,878 --> 01:05:56,218
Okay.

778
01:05:56,498 --> 01:05:58,159
So are we.

779
01:06:01,121 --> 01:06:05,183
Oh, that's this is another thing that's related to some of the things we've been talking about, but.

780
01:06:05,963 --> 01:06:09,865
For those initiative procedures that we talked about.

781
01:06:11,942 --> 01:06:25,727
they have to be at least 20% of the registered voters, which means that a small number of people, if they get something on a ballot, can't just all show up with only 1,000 people or whatever and pass something.

782
01:06:28,047 --> 01:06:30,928
So there's a required level of voter participation.

783
01:06:33,668 --> 01:06:38,651
So it's pretty, it's definitely a big lift.

784
01:06:39,471 --> 01:06:50,618
I mean, what we wanted was to give people these rights and these options, but it's not simple to overturn an ordinance or anything like that.

785
01:06:52,639 --> 01:06:56,361
So no questions and no changes on the recall section?

786
01:06:56,381 --> 01:06:57,922
None from me.

787
01:06:58,542 --> 01:06:58,803
Great.

788
01:07:00,324 --> 01:07:00,524
And...

789
01:07:02,646 --> 01:07:07,248
These were basically just boilerplate.

790
01:07:07,729 --> 01:07:08,029
All right.

791
01:07:08,249 --> 01:07:09,850
I think we've gone through this section.

792
01:07:09,870 --> 01:07:12,371
Motion to approve.

793
01:07:13,272 --> 01:07:13,632
Okay.

794
01:07:15,133 --> 01:07:15,493
Second?

795
01:07:16,193 --> 01:07:18,354
Second.

796
01:07:18,514 --> 01:07:18,935
Okay.

797
01:07:21,076 --> 01:07:21,396
Eunice?

798
01:07:21,876 --> 01:07:22,156
Yes.

799
01:07:24,278 --> 01:07:24,678
Ron?

800
01:07:25,378 --> 01:07:25,678
Yes.

801
01:07:27,739 --> 01:07:28,120
Paulette?

802
01:07:28,580 --> 01:07:28,820
Yes.

803
01:07:30,041 --> 01:07:30,401
Phyllis?

804
01:07:30,981 --> 01:07:31,261
Yes.

805
01:07:32,042 --> 01:07:32,382
Dania?

806
01:07:34,020 --> 01:07:35,182
Yes, Aubrey.

807
01:07:35,202 --> 01:07:35,302
Yes.

808
01:07:35,963 --> 01:07:36,244
And Anthony.

809
01:07:36,264 --> 01:07:36,324
Yes.

810
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:42,661
And I'm yes.

811
01:07:42,681 --> 01:07:42,741
Yay.

812
01:07:43,061 --> 01:07:43,421
All right.

813
01:07:43,541 --> 01:07:44,282
So there's eight.

814
01:07:44,862 --> 01:07:50,624
So this group joins sections two, three, and seven in the, we are done with those drafts filed.

815
01:07:51,304 --> 01:07:51,644
Yes.

816
01:07:52,105 --> 01:08:04,129
And four, except we do have the outstanding, which I think before we, we do have to go to six, but I want to just touch on that leftover issue from article four of the combined awards.

817
01:08:04,630 --> 01:08:06,890
Can we talk about four since it wasn't on the agenda?

818
01:08:08,031 --> 01:08:08,111
Um,

819
01:08:10,878 --> 01:08:15,361
Well, are we holding up from the next meeting?

820
01:08:15,381 --> 01:08:18,003
Yep.

821
01:08:18,063 --> 01:08:24,847
I mean, I think, you know, yeah.

822
01:08:25,308 --> 01:08:30,251
And there also is another potential school committee subcommittee.

823
01:08:30,711 --> 01:08:33,033
Okay, I wasn't aware that that was going to happen.

824
01:08:33,073 --> 01:08:35,975
Well, we're going to try, so we should have better answers, would you say, Paula?

825
01:08:36,685 --> 01:08:41,809
Yeah, I sent it out today, Melba, seeing when people were available to discuss it.

826
01:08:43,610 --> 01:08:45,272
You know, I do have some qualms about it.

827
01:08:45,632 --> 01:08:49,415
I'll try to get more information from the Collins Center.

828
01:08:52,714 --> 01:09:03,382
example language from other charters, but I just don't understand why our committee here would do it versus the elections commission.

829
01:09:05,423 --> 01:09:11,627
So I just have a, I don't understand why it would be in our purview to do it.

830
01:09:13,108 --> 01:09:18,512
Well, it's because we're writing a draft charter and it would be part of the charter, but

831
01:09:19,396 --> 01:09:22,599
But I'm writing.

832
01:09:24,401 --> 01:09:26,103
We're just making that recommendation.

833
01:09:26,683 --> 01:09:28,124
We don't draw the lines there.

834
01:09:30,847 --> 01:09:33,649
Paulette, I don't know if you got my email because I sent it late.

835
01:09:33,669 --> 01:09:35,011
Yeah, I did.

836
01:09:35,151 --> 01:09:36,772
I don't think that's part.

837
01:09:37,073 --> 01:09:39,435
I don't think we should be entertaining.

838
01:09:40,817 --> 01:09:45,724
Okay, we're going to take that up at the next meeting and I'll try to get more information from the call center.

839
01:09:46,345 --> 01:09:51,892
Okay, so on so article 6, before we get into the text, I just wanted to say gene.

840
01:09:53,574 --> 01:09:57,159
As we had voted on, she did look into.

841
01:09:58,806 --> 01:10:19,201
moving the ability for the city council to move money in the budget, and the subcommittee briefly met on it, and Gene wanted to put this forth for inclusion in the final report, to include this as a recommendation in the final report, not in the charter, just in our final report.

842
01:10:20,341 --> 01:10:36,756
Basically, what she found was there are other states, notably Alabama and California, that allow most municipalities to have their city council, their municipal bodies move money in the budget, and then there were also a few cities like

843
01:10:37,517 --> 01:10:41,359
Seattle and Honolulu are the ones I remember so city.

844
01:10:41,659 --> 01:10:42,739
I think it's all like city.

845
01:10:42,759 --> 01:10:42,979
Yeah.

846
01:10:43,140 --> 01:10:44,500
So it's not unheard of.

847
01:10:45,641 --> 01:10:50,663
It is unheard of in Massachusetts and a large reason for that.

848
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:59,804
could be because it's outlined, prohibited in Massachusetts general laws.

849
01:11:00,645 --> 01:11:10,510
So the recommendation is not to change, to try to put it into our draft charter, but to include this in the final report and recommend that.

850
01:11:11,310 --> 01:11:12,311
What's the recommendation?

851
01:11:13,297 --> 01:11:29,282
that the next charter review include a more in-depth analysis of budgeting options for Medford, including a review of the status of budgeting under the new budget ordinance, ability to include participatory budgeting, and options for city council to increase or amend budget lines.

852
01:11:29,963 --> 01:11:42,787
So basically, we would be recommending, we would be saying that based on our research and our investigation and our discussion, we are not including that

853
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:51,766
in this charter, but we are recommending that the next charter review look at it more deeply.

854
01:11:51,786 --> 01:11:54,568
I think that's okay.

855
01:11:55,589 --> 01:11:55,929
Okay.

856
01:11:57,690 --> 01:12:03,875
So I'm going to make the motion on Jean's behalf because she wanted to propose that we include this in the final report.

857
01:12:06,417 --> 01:12:06,777
I second.

858
01:12:06,797 --> 01:12:07,358
I'll second it.

859
01:12:08,298 --> 01:12:08,719
Okay.

860
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:11,341
Paulette.

861
01:12:12,662 --> 01:12:12,842
Yes.

862
01:12:14,525 --> 01:12:14,905
Anthony?

863
01:12:18,727 --> 01:12:19,527
Yes, okay.

864
01:12:21,468 --> 01:12:21,768
Eunice?

865
01:12:22,329 --> 01:12:22,589
Yes.

866
01:12:23,049 --> 01:12:23,389
Ron?

867
01:12:24,490 --> 01:12:24,770
Yes.

868
01:12:25,210 --> 01:12:25,610
Paulette?

869
01:12:26,310 --> 01:12:26,571
Yes.

870
01:12:27,511 --> 01:12:28,031
Aubrey?

871
01:12:28,591 --> 01:12:30,212
Oh, I'm sorry, Aubrey.

872
01:12:32,293 --> 01:12:38,216
Yes, when we do the final report, can we, we don't have to do it tonight, but talk about what that new budget ordinance means?

873
01:12:39,767 --> 01:12:44,331
Yeah, we're actually going to be talking about in a couple of minutes in relation to something else in this chapter.

874
01:12:46,373 --> 01:12:47,954
In this article, I mean.

875
01:12:48,715 --> 01:12:49,395
Who did I miss?

876
01:12:49,916 --> 01:12:50,797
Me, Phyllis.

877
01:12:51,177 --> 01:12:51,557
Phyllis.

878
01:12:52,338 --> 01:12:52,718
Me too.

879
01:12:53,739 --> 01:12:54,280
And Danielle?

880
01:12:54,980 --> 01:12:55,200
Yes.

881
01:12:56,161 --> 01:12:57,542
And Phyllis is also a yes?

882
01:12:58,003 --> 01:12:58,263
Yes.

883
01:12:59,104 --> 01:13:00,545
Okay, and I'll be a yes too.

884
01:13:02,006 --> 01:13:02,827
Sorry, it's just...

885
01:13:06,443 --> 01:13:07,383
When I'm sharing screen.

886
01:13:07,403 --> 01:13:08,464
I can't see everybody.

887
01:13:08,524 --> 01:13:12,025
So that's why Don't worry about that.

888
01:13:12,425 --> 01:13:12,985
Okay.

889
01:13:13,505 --> 01:13:16,626
Okay, so now article six.

890
01:13:16,686 --> 01:13:21,568
The one thing that I wanted to bring up is that this first annual budget meeting.

891
01:13:21,648 --> 01:13:22,648
We saw this in

892
01:13:24,158 --> 01:13:26,099
Not all of the other chart.

893
01:13:26,299 --> 01:13:31,722
The three main charters we're looking at, not all of them have this, but two of them, I believe, did.

894
01:13:32,383 --> 01:13:33,443
Rose and Pittsfield did.

895
01:13:33,524 --> 01:13:34,124
Yeah.

896
01:13:34,164 --> 01:13:35,485
We wanted to include it.

897
01:13:36,505 --> 01:13:47,171
The other thing the subcommittee did was go talk to the administration just to make sure that the proposals here would be feasible.

898
01:13:48,032 --> 01:13:53,355
They expressed skepticism that they could

899
01:13:54,324 --> 01:13:56,788
accomplish this particular section here.

900
01:14:00,183 --> 01:14:07,645
especially given that there is a budget ordinance that is, I believe it's already passed, Eunice?

901
01:14:07,745 --> 01:14:08,865
Yes.

902
01:14:09,805 --> 01:14:10,105
It is.

903
01:14:10,165 --> 01:14:14,766
It's very detailed and it lays out a lot of requirements.

904
01:14:14,786 --> 01:14:18,047
I think that's where the concern comes from.

905
01:14:19,747 --> 01:14:24,228
Now, this charter would supersede anything in an ordinance.

906
01:14:24,468 --> 01:14:26,749
However, I think there's concern about

907
01:14:28,608 --> 01:14:34,734
Well, having to comply with the ordinance and this if there's a conflict.

908
01:14:34,834 --> 01:14:41,580
So when the subcommittee met, there was resistance to removing this from the charter.

909
01:14:42,261 --> 01:14:46,825
So one of the proposals was to maybe just take out that language in purple.

910
01:14:47,426 --> 01:14:48,407
Here, let me make this bigger.

911
01:14:50,569 --> 01:14:51,730
And maybe that would sort of

912
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:54,400
help.

913
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:57,981
So Eunice, you said you've done some more research.

914
01:14:58,381 --> 01:15:01,461
Yeah, I spent a good deal of this afternoon.

915
01:15:02,062 --> 01:15:15,444
I went through 30 charters that had mayoral form of government, ranging in population from about 40,000 people to about 95,000 people.

916
01:15:15,464 --> 01:15:16,144
And I only found

917
01:15:23,185 --> 01:15:29,210
Um, 5 charters that had this annual budget meeting section in it.

918
01:15:29,850 --> 01:15:30,651
And that would be.

919
01:15:33,373 --> 01:15:36,676
2 of the ones that we're looking closely at Melrose and Pittsfield.

920
01:15:37,436 --> 01:15:40,679
As well as effort fall river and Somerville.

921
01:15:40,699 --> 01:15:45,423
Um, and, um, they.

922
01:15:46,323 --> 01:15:51,307
I didn't look too closely at the number of days piece, but they varied a bit.

923
01:15:52,328 --> 01:16:04,318
But they all had the language in it about the revenue and expenditure forecasts in it in some form or another.

924
01:16:06,780 --> 01:16:19,364
My feeling on this is that I would like to keep in there the concept of a meeting amongst the three bodies.

925
01:16:19,585 --> 01:16:20,145
I think it's

926
01:16:21,382 --> 01:16:38,361
Uh, imperative that the 3, I, I personally would like to see the 3 bodies collaborating more than once a year, but I'll take the once a year meeting so that they're coming together and in the interests of the city talking about.

927
01:16:39,142 --> 01:16:45,590
The finances and the needs and priorities of the entire community.

928
01:16:45,610 --> 01:16:56,904
Yeah, I think there was a lot of talk about that last night as well as the collaboration and the transparency amongst the bodies.

929
01:16:58,685 --> 01:17:04,769
And since there's not a lot of collaboration, this requires them to get together at least once a year.

930
01:17:04,849 --> 01:17:13,795
So, I think, as Melvin said, there's strong feelings last night that we keep this in there for that reason.

931
01:17:13,815 --> 01:17:17,978
I would be willing to put in some sort of.

932
01:17:19,021 --> 01:17:44,460
language, either take, taking out that revenue and expenditures forecast and, you know, either removing it entirely or replacing it with something that allows the mayor to request of her CFO and the CFO of the school committee to bring to the meeting any, you know,

933
01:17:46,338 --> 01:17:52,902
relevant information that she may require.

934
01:17:52,922 --> 01:18:13,053
I would think if this meeting is being held in March or April, that the finance people from the two branches of government should be able to at least provide the first and second quarter financial data.

935
01:18:14,248 --> 01:18:24,254
Uh, to give the group some sense of where they stand in the budget and find out how things are going from a lot of different perspectives.

936
01:18:24,974 --> 01:18:28,516
So, maybe leaving it up to the mayor to decide.

937
01:18:29,917 --> 01:18:33,239
What data she feels is relevant to have a productive discussion.

938
01:18:34,750 --> 01:18:41,314
OK, I guess I'm surprised that only five out of the 30 have this.

939
01:18:42,354 --> 01:18:48,238
And they all seem to be sort of charters that were done fairly recently.

940
01:18:48,258 --> 01:18:54,461
I think Somerville's, Fall River, and Everett are newer charters.

941
01:18:55,702 --> 01:19:02,126
I was a little surprised that Framingham didn't have it, because I know that they went from a town to a city over the past few years.

942
01:19:04,287 --> 01:19:08,310
So I was a little, and we did their charter, so I'm a little surprised that they didn't have it.

943
01:19:08,910 --> 01:19:12,833
And then, you know, our friends in Melrose and Pittsfield that we've been looking at anyway.

944
01:19:13,113 --> 01:19:18,217
So yeah, I was surprised that I didn't come up with more.

945
01:19:18,237 --> 01:19:20,559
You know, maybe there are others.

946
01:19:20,639 --> 01:19:25,783
I didn't have time to go through them, but 30 is certainly a pretty decent sampling.

947
01:19:26,303 --> 01:19:27,264
I would say so.

948
01:19:27,344 --> 01:19:29,145
Thank you, Eunice.

949
01:19:29,686 --> 01:19:30,946
Any other thoughts about this?

950
01:19:34,335 --> 01:19:37,957
Go ahead.

951
01:19:37,977 --> 01:19:50,423
So the keys here are that the administration is concerned about being able to meet this requirement and five out of 30 charters we looked at have it, but 25 don't.

952
01:19:52,003 --> 01:20:02,788
And there's a sort of a strong desire or a strong feeling that getting the three bodies of government together and to

953
01:20:05,391 --> 01:20:07,432
in this participatory way would be a good thing.

954
01:20:08,332 --> 01:20:08,752
Paula?

955
01:20:09,532 --> 01:20:11,272
Well, I like this.

956
01:20:11,572 --> 01:20:13,953
Is it would be difficult because of the time?

957
01:20:17,254 --> 01:20:17,754
The time?

958
01:20:17,774 --> 01:20:32,197
I think it's the time and it's also the other requirements because there's very specific requirements that the administration will have to comply with at laid out in the budget ordinance.

959
01:20:33,774 --> 01:20:36,835
And so it might, so there's also that.

960
01:20:39,897 --> 01:20:43,758
I'd like to ask a couple questions and make a comment.

961
01:20:44,659 --> 01:20:51,682
First, I guess my first question is, this is the first I've heard of the

962
01:20:52,896 --> 01:20:56,680
that there's a strong kind of support for this.

963
01:20:57,140 --> 01:20:59,863
I don't know, was that at a meeting or something?

964
01:20:59,883 --> 01:21:03,847
There was a subcommittee meeting.

965
01:21:04,287 --> 01:21:04,588
Right.

966
01:21:05,609 --> 01:21:10,374
And that, you know, there is a pilot, you know, this year they're piloting this

967
01:21:11,074 --> 01:21:11,814
this ordinance.

968
01:21:11,974 --> 01:21:15,275
It's something that Medford has never done before.

969
01:21:15,295 --> 01:21:18,356
You know, the budgets were always last minute.

970
01:21:18,536 --> 01:21:33,440
We have a very, very small kind of financial department, and they've always been kind of on a crash course to get the budget in order, you know, just because of all the moving parts.

971
01:21:33,540 --> 01:21:33,600
And

972
01:21:35,545 --> 01:21:58,520
From I heard at the City Council not long ago, I believe from Kit Collins was saying that, you know, this new ordinance and this collaboration with the administration is going quite well and it's very new and it involves a lot of work on the, you know, on the financial side.

973
01:21:59,653 --> 01:22:19,145
You know, I think it's a great start and I don't think we should be kind of putting more into it while they're trying to come up with something that's a product that's more transparent and earlier in the season and involving the city council much earlier in the process.

974
01:22:21,447 --> 01:22:21,707
I think.

975
01:22:23,018 --> 01:22:52,607
would the best that there should be something in the charter that kind of that requires you know an ordinance to be kind of established and updated as needed you know to handle the finances that it's not kind of you know put into the charter and stuck there for 10 years if it's if it doesn't work out if you know

976
01:22:53,830 --> 01:23:10,768
I don't know, having the city council and the school committee and the mayor holding public meetings and fighting over money at a certain time of year will kind of help the process at all.

977
01:23:10,788 --> 01:23:14,071
I think that's really something that

978
01:23:15,495 --> 01:23:23,801
I'd like to get more input from the city council, the mayor, and other folks, the school committee people.

979
01:23:24,342 --> 01:23:26,123
Would that really help?

980
01:23:27,324 --> 01:23:28,424
I guess that's my question.

981
01:23:29,245 --> 01:23:30,306
Okay, thank you.

982
01:23:31,186 --> 01:23:33,108
Aubrey, did you have a comment?

983
01:23:34,109 --> 01:23:43,015
Yeah, I think without the purple, it largely becomes symbolic, which might be why other towns don't include it.

984
01:23:43,707 --> 01:23:47,128
Yeah, I'm okay with the symbolism and I also think that.

985
01:23:47,909 --> 01:23:50,990
If what Anthony is describing does happen.

986
01:23:51,830 --> 01:23:54,651
This could be incorporated into that process pretty easily.

987
01:23:56,372 --> 01:24:00,114
Yes, so, um, thank you.

988
01:24:00,654 --> 01:24:01,074
Let's see.

989
01:24:01,114 --> 01:24:03,735
Somebody else has their hand up.

990
01:24:03,915 --> 01:24:06,196
And Ron, did you guys want to say something?

991
01:24:06,856 --> 01:24:08,117
I'll let Ron go ahead and then I'll go.

992
01:24:08,798 --> 01:24:17,407
Well, just quickly to some of Anthony's points, this charter won't really take effect for a few years down the road.

993
01:24:17,507 --> 01:24:22,192
So I don't want to, you know, they'll have plenty of time to work on this current process.

994
01:24:22,852 --> 01:24:29,179
But, you know, the city is not where it should be in terms of financial transparency and responsibility.

995
01:24:29,219 --> 01:24:30,100
So I think that

996
01:24:30,720 --> 01:24:43,971
these kind of symbolic or realistic restrictions should be part of the charter just to protect, to make sure that three years or four years from now when the charter goes into effect, this is in place.

997
01:24:44,091 --> 01:24:44,792
That's my opinion.

998
01:24:47,083 --> 01:24:49,204
Okay, is there any other comments?

999
01:24:50,265 --> 01:24:51,445
Yeah, just.

1000
01:24:52,406 --> 01:24:57,528
You know, as far as the budget ordinance, I've been watching the budget meetings, you know.

1001
01:24:58,409 --> 01:25:04,532
Pretty closely and watching them go through the process and they did a tremendous amount of work.

1002
01:25:05,213 --> 01:25:08,197
On the budget ordinance, I think it's improving the budget process.

1003
01:25:09,458 --> 01:25:12,602
Tremendously, it does appear to be working.

1004
01:25:12,682 --> 01:25:15,386
They've already had 5 or 6 budget meetings.

1005
01:25:15,867 --> 01:25:17,068
The full budget's due to be.

1006
01:25:18,380 --> 01:25:21,181
presented by the end of this month.

1007
01:25:21,721 --> 01:25:30,044
And I'm sure that they'll tweak things as they go in the ordinance when they find things that were not working as they should or whatever.

1008
01:25:31,045 --> 01:25:32,965
So it's made a big difference.

1009
01:25:33,085 --> 01:25:39,468
But I think what this does here is bring the three bodies together.

1010
01:25:39,488 --> 01:25:45,450
And I think having all of our elected officials sitting down in one room, and I don't believe

1011
01:25:46,270 --> 01:25:51,334
And I hope that wouldn't be fighting over money or fighting over the budget.

1012
01:25:51,955 --> 01:25:54,917
I would hope and pray that they'd be sitting in a room together.

1013
01:25:55,617 --> 01:26:01,602
Talking about the best interests across the city and finding a way to.

1014
01:26:02,843 --> 01:26:10,226
with the pot of money that we have, dispersing that works best for the city.

1015
01:26:11,107 --> 01:26:21,451
I don't think it can ever hurt to put all of our elected officials face-to-face in one room and having to work and collaborate together.

1016
01:26:21,471 --> 01:26:28,994
I think I would leave it to the mayor to decide prior to the meeting,

1017
01:26:32,495 --> 01:26:46,082
I'm sure that he or she will have some ideas of what financial data the two CFOs can bring to the meeting to make it productive, as I said earlier.

1018
01:26:46,102 --> 01:26:52,786
And the mayor can determine that.

1019
01:26:53,406 --> 01:26:59,530
But I think it's always a good thing to get people sitting in a room together face-to-face.

1020
01:27:00,828 --> 01:27:03,650
Okay, Paulette, did you have something you want to say?

1021
01:27:03,710 --> 01:27:04,710
Yeah, I agree.

1022
01:27:04,790 --> 01:27:13,035
I think that having both bodies and the mayor together, hearing the same thing at the same time is a valuable thing.

1023
01:27:13,536 --> 01:27:20,340
And I'm hoping that that complements what the improvements in the budget.

1024
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:25,663
So I think whether you leave revenue and expenditure forecasts is,

1025
01:27:27,018 --> 01:27:35,903
I don't think you need to specify that if that's problematical, but because any other relevant information, it's really covered.

1026
01:27:36,904 --> 01:27:52,432
I'm going to make a proposal that we adopt this and say to review the financial condition of the city and share relevant information.

1027
01:27:52,452 --> 01:27:53,433
It's in the comment there.

1028
01:27:55,309 --> 01:27:56,890
that it'll be up to the mayor to decide.

1029
01:27:58,190 --> 01:28:06,512
Well, it just says to review that the three bodies, yeah, to review the financial condition of the city and share relevant information.

1030
01:28:06,652 --> 01:28:09,153
So that's my motion.

1031
01:28:10,293 --> 01:28:10,914
I'll second that.

1032
01:28:10,934 --> 01:28:11,394
I'll second it.

1033
01:28:11,994 --> 01:28:12,374
Okay.

1034
01:28:15,135 --> 01:28:15,435
Eunice?

1035
01:28:16,315 --> 01:28:16,535
Yes.

1036
01:28:18,156 --> 01:28:18,496
Ron?

1037
01:28:20,316 --> 01:28:20,596
Yes.

1038
01:28:21,897 --> 01:28:22,297
Paulette?

1039
01:28:22,877 --> 01:28:23,097
Yes.

1040
01:28:24,298 --> 01:28:24,658
Aubrey?

1041
01:28:25,138 --> 01:28:25,399
Yes.

1042
01:28:26,239 --> 01:28:26,759
Danielle?

1043
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:28,060
Yes.

1044
01:28:29,640 --> 01:28:30,000
Phyllis?

1045
01:28:30,641 --> 01:28:30,941
Yes.

1046
01:28:31,641 --> 01:28:32,341
And I'll vote yes.

1047
01:28:32,622 --> 01:28:32,942
Great.

1048
01:28:33,122 --> 01:28:35,483
Do I get a vote?

1049
01:28:36,463 --> 01:28:37,604
Oh, yes, I'm really sorry.

1050
01:28:39,004 --> 01:28:40,665
I'll actually vote no.

1051
01:28:41,025 --> 01:28:41,325
Okay.

1052
01:28:41,365 --> 01:28:41,705
Thank you.

1053
01:28:42,326 --> 01:28:46,507
So I thought I had counted eight, but I must have only counted seven.

1054
01:28:46,847 --> 01:28:47,648
Okay, great.

1055
01:28:47,968 --> 01:28:48,688
Sorry about that.

1056
01:28:50,709 --> 01:28:52,670
Thank you for keeping me honest, everyone.

1057
01:28:54,738 --> 01:29:00,302
Okay, so the next sections are, they're pretty boilerplate.

1058
01:29:00,742 --> 01:29:04,044
It just has to do with the timeline of the submission of the budget.

1059
01:29:04,925 --> 01:29:08,627
And, you know, did everyone have a chance to look at that?

1060
01:29:13,310 --> 01:29:23,637
Now, when this is done by ordinance right now, and I believe what you passed out about the

1061
01:29:24,775 --> 01:29:33,883
the group that has suggestions for charter, you know, if something can be done by ordinance, it's best not to put in the charter.

1062
01:29:35,645 --> 01:29:37,667
Well, yes, that's true.

1063
01:29:38,427 --> 01:29:43,051
This is a pretty, this is just a very basic timeline.

1064
01:29:48,599 --> 01:29:50,481
But if it's in the charter, they can't change it.

1065
01:29:50,521 --> 01:30:08,538
If there's something going on, you know, if they need to adopt it, if there's a crisis or there's, you know, some kind of fiscal kind of cliff we fall off and they want to use different timelines, they can't because they have to comply with the charter.

1066
01:30:10,130 --> 01:30:16,433
Well, I mean, they have to comply no matter what with the end of the fiscal, what was it, June 30th?

1067
01:30:16,494 --> 01:30:16,674
Yes.

1068
01:30:16,694 --> 01:30:17,914
That's right.

1069
01:30:17,994 --> 01:30:18,274
Yes.

1070
01:30:19,235 --> 01:30:31,281
So it's not like they can, you know, I mean, there are, so everything that we looked at was, you know, we considered that, we considered that.

1071
01:30:32,942 --> 01:30:34,543
Basically, this is a very basic,

1072
01:30:36,257 --> 01:30:38,999
Outline, but if you think it shouldn't be included.

1073
01:30:39,019 --> 01:30:43,643
I mean, the other piece was the capital improvement.

1074
01:30:44,824 --> 01:30:47,346
Which we recommended every 3 years.

1075
01:30:48,987 --> 01:30:50,088
I have a question about that.

1076
01:30:51,770 --> 01:30:57,394
So, in the capital improvement, it's every 3 years the mayor gets voted every.

1077
01:30:58,675 --> 01:30:59,596
We suggested every 4.

1078
01:31:04,626 --> 01:31:07,007
Is it the cycle of the mayors?

1079
01:31:08,848 --> 01:31:20,954
You're not necessarily looking to have, let's say you have a new mayor, but it's time for that report to be due and all of a sudden it's due in the first year of the new mayor's term.

1080
01:31:21,954 --> 01:31:23,555
Yeah, that could be hard.

1081
01:31:27,477 --> 01:31:28,237
But, you know,

1082
01:31:29,558 --> 01:31:31,379
What's the alternative that we do it?

1083
01:31:31,919 --> 01:31:44,304
I mean, we decided doing it more frequently would be sort of a hardship because it's a pretty big deal to put together, and it's not really necessary to do it every year, and maybe four years might be too long.

1084
01:31:44,324 --> 01:31:45,084
I don't know.

1085
01:31:45,244 --> 01:31:47,705
Unless you think differently, it would be good to hear.

1086
01:31:47,725 --> 01:31:53,127
Can we suggest that it be done the third year of a Mario Earl term?

1087
01:32:00,780 --> 01:32:04,942
every, so the third year of every mayoral term?

1088
01:32:04,962 --> 01:32:06,103
Is that what you're saying?

1089
01:32:06,123 --> 01:32:07,824
How about the second year?

1090
01:32:07,844 --> 01:32:09,184
Yes.

1091
01:32:09,224 --> 01:32:19,710
I mean, I think what Paulette's trying to say is you're always at three years, this is why we're not voting every three-year terms, is you're going to have that situation every third term.

1092
01:32:20,050 --> 01:32:23,031
You're going to have a mayor rushing to get it done in year one.

1093
01:32:23,412 --> 01:32:27,694
But if you say after two years of a mayoral term,

1094
01:32:28,254 --> 01:32:33,376
That means when you start, this is a project you got to finish within two or three years, whatever number we decide.

1095
01:32:33,776 --> 01:32:35,257
But at least it's balanced over.

1096
01:32:35,957 --> 01:32:38,478
We voted for a four-year term for the mayor.

1097
01:32:39,078 --> 01:32:39,519
Yeah.

1098
01:32:40,159 --> 01:32:46,881
I mean, I guess no matter what, a new mayor still has to submit a budget even though they're a new mayor.

1099
01:32:47,222 --> 01:32:54,284
The only thing that can happen is that their first budget happens to fall on the capital improvement year as well.

1100
01:32:54,925 --> 01:32:55,705
That's the concern?

1101
01:32:56,633 --> 01:33:03,897
You get inaugurated in January, and by June, you have to have a capital improvement plan.

1102
01:33:04,157 --> 01:33:10,981
I'm saying it would make more sense, like Ron says, to do it in the second year.

1103
01:33:12,181 --> 01:33:21,186
What you'd want is you want to give the mayor some time to put together the capital improvement plan, and then you also want some years on the other side.

1104
01:33:21,226 --> 01:33:24,608
The proposal is that this language be changed to,

1105
01:33:25,460 --> 01:33:29,803
at the end of the second year of the mayor's term, no later than.

1106
01:33:32,125 --> 01:33:39,891
What about by the end of the third quarter of the mayor's second year?

1107
01:33:45,915 --> 01:33:52,520
My feeling is that that complicates things unnecessarily, but if that's a proposal that you wanna make and we'll vote on it.

1108
01:33:53,256 --> 01:33:56,039
So Milda, you've got a new mayor.

1109
01:33:56,059 --> 01:33:57,440
Yeah.

1110
01:33:57,600 --> 01:33:58,901
And it's that year.

1111
01:34:00,503 --> 01:34:03,045
He comes in on January.

1112
01:34:03,926 --> 01:34:12,994
And there we probably would be a capital improvement program by the end of the first year.

1113
01:34:13,014 --> 01:34:15,056
That's a big lift.

1114
01:34:16,257 --> 01:34:16,417
Mm-hmm.

1115
01:34:18,165 --> 01:34:26,791
And I think that even earlier than that I just highlighted 3 months before the start of the fiscal year, which is what July 1. so it would be due April.

1116
01:34:29,552 --> 01:34:31,073
Can I ask what it is now?

1117
01:34:31,254 --> 01:34:37,678
Is there any type of requirement or how often does this occur?

1118
01:34:41,750 --> 01:34:43,311
I don't think there's a requirement.

1119
01:34:43,471 --> 01:34:49,433
And there were some charters we looked at that did it every year, but definitely not all.

1120
01:34:49,573 --> 01:34:52,394
And it doesn't seem necessary every year.

1121
01:34:53,354 --> 01:34:56,595
So that's why we didn't put every year.

1122
01:34:56,975 --> 01:35:01,357
Well, you could do an update with a yearly update.

1123
01:35:01,900 --> 01:35:04,622
Well, right in below there is the update requirement.

1124
01:35:04,702 --> 01:35:08,764
So in that next paragraph is exactly what Paula just referred to.

1125
01:35:08,884 --> 01:35:09,064
So.

1126
01:35:09,084 --> 01:35:09,905
Okay, sorry.

1127
01:35:10,025 --> 01:35:16,028
So this is a program that sets goals, I assume, for capital improvement.

1128
01:35:16,929 --> 01:35:21,451
The mayor is obliged with every year to update where that is.

1129
01:35:21,591 --> 01:35:24,533
So it's not like it's only addressed every three years.

1130
01:35:24,613 --> 01:35:26,354
It's something that's addressed annually.

1131
01:35:26,414 --> 01:35:28,735
But this formal meeting, I think, again,

1132
01:35:30,635 --> 01:35:36,498
This is more, I'm more inclined to vote for two years into their term, have had this meeting.

1133
01:35:36,698 --> 01:35:38,359
I just think they'd be better prepared for it.

1134
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:43,542
I like that too, because in the next line, the plan is, it's a five-year plan.

1135
01:35:51,467 --> 01:35:54,108
Okay, so are you making that motion, Ron?

1136
01:35:57,230 --> 01:35:57,470
Sure.

1137
01:36:01,890 --> 01:36:09,633
Um, so it would be, shall submit a capital improvement program to the city within the first two years of the mayoral term.

1138
01:36:11,153 --> 01:36:13,234
That means they could do it in a year if they want to.

1139
01:36:15,935 --> 01:36:17,455
I suppose it would depend on who's mayor.

1140
01:36:17,515 --> 01:36:25,258
If it's somebody that, you know, rises up in the ranks, you know, like Brianna did, maybe you as a better grasp of city finances.

1141
01:36:25,278 --> 01:36:27,379
Well, it could be the existing mayor too.

1142
01:36:27,899 --> 01:36:28,099
Yeah.

1143
01:36:28,259 --> 01:36:31,200
Or the existing mayor or, you know, somebody that maybe,

1144
01:36:33,070 --> 01:36:40,113
Yeah, but my motion is to change that to within the first two years of the mayoral term.

1145
01:36:40,773 --> 01:36:42,994
Of the mayor's term or the mayoral term?

1146
01:36:43,514 --> 01:36:46,195
The mayor's current term.

1147
01:36:47,476 --> 01:36:51,958
The mayor's current term, okay.

1148
01:36:52,098 --> 01:36:52,478
Okay.

1149
01:36:53,658 --> 01:36:54,579
That's good, yeah.

1150
01:36:55,039 --> 01:36:56,940
Okay, so that's the motion on the table.

1151
01:36:57,020 --> 01:36:57,920
We got it seconded?

1152
01:36:57,940 --> 01:36:59,861
I'll second it.

1153
01:37:00,301 --> 01:37:01,762
Okay, great.

1154
01:37:01,882 --> 01:37:02,622
Okay, Ron.

1155
01:37:04,678 --> 01:37:04,938
Yes.

1156
01:37:05,538 --> 01:37:06,179
Eunice.

1157
01:37:06,799 --> 01:37:07,139
Yes.

1158
01:37:08,399 --> 01:37:08,839
Phyllis.

1159
01:37:09,359 --> 01:37:09,679
Yes.

1160
01:37:10,540 --> 01:37:11,120
Aubrey.

1161
01:37:13,060 --> 01:37:15,421
Yes.

1162
01:37:15,601 --> 01:37:15,981
Anthony.

1163
01:37:19,542 --> 01:37:20,582
I think I'll abstain.

1164
01:37:20,602 --> 01:37:24,703
I'm not quite informed enough about it.

1165
01:37:25,603 --> 01:37:26,083
Okay.

1166
01:37:26,303 --> 01:37:30,284
Danielle.

1167
01:37:32,445 --> 01:37:32,645
No.

1168
01:37:32,805 --> 01:37:33,845
I got Phyllis, right?

1169
01:37:36,302 --> 01:37:37,143
Thank you, Paula.

1170
01:37:37,743 --> 01:37:38,063
Yes.

1171
01:37:39,043 --> 01:37:41,404
Okay, I'm voting no, but it passes.

1172
01:37:41,724 --> 01:37:43,204
So we will change that.

1173
01:37:49,165 --> 01:37:51,846
Within the first two years of the mayor's term.

1174
01:37:53,026 --> 01:37:54,327
Of the current mayor's term.

1175
01:37:54,827 --> 01:37:59,128
Years of the mayor's term.

1176
01:37:59,568 --> 01:37:59,848
Okay.

1177
01:38:02,783 --> 01:38:04,124
Okay.

1178
01:38:04,304 --> 01:38:11,026
Any other things that we want to revisit in this section, in this article, or that's pretty much the end of it?

1179
01:38:12,167 --> 01:38:14,088
We can go down to the audit part for just one second.

1180
01:38:14,508 --> 01:38:18,409
Yeah.

1181
01:38:18,569 --> 01:38:18,890
Okay.

1182
01:38:20,330 --> 01:38:20,650
I'm good.

1183
01:38:21,391 --> 01:38:21,711
Okay.

1184
01:38:23,511 --> 01:38:24,612
Are we ready to vote on this?

1185
01:38:25,172 --> 01:38:25,852
Move approval.

1186
01:38:27,013 --> 01:38:27,473
Second?

1187
01:38:28,674 --> 01:38:28,994
Second.

1188
01:38:29,954 --> 01:38:30,534
Okay.

1189
01:38:31,295 --> 01:38:31,715
Ron?

1190
01:38:33,698 --> 01:38:35,219
Just one piece of clarity.

1191
01:38:35,339 --> 01:38:38,380
This recommendation at the top here.

1192
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:40,420
Yeah.

1193
01:38:41,101 --> 01:38:45,662
If we're voting on this, are we making it part of the charter or we're just making it as a subnote?

1194
01:38:46,222 --> 01:38:48,663
No, we voted just to put this in the final report.

1195
01:38:49,143 --> 01:38:51,484
So it's not in the draft charter.

1196
01:38:52,084 --> 01:38:52,725
To vote yes.

1197
01:38:53,505 --> 01:38:53,845
OK.

1198
01:38:54,305 --> 01:38:54,585
Eunice.

1199
01:38:55,065 --> 01:38:55,325
Yes.

1200
01:38:55,726 --> 01:38:56,146
Phyllis.

1201
01:38:56,646 --> 01:38:56,966
Yes.

1202
01:38:57,506 --> 01:38:57,906
Paulette.

1203
01:38:58,366 --> 01:38:58,607
Yes.

1204
01:38:59,207 --> 01:38:59,647
Anthony.

1205
01:39:02,328 --> 01:39:02,568
Yes.

1206
01:39:03,739 --> 01:39:04,279
Danielle?

1207
01:39:06,080 --> 01:39:06,300
Yes.

1208
01:39:07,061 --> 01:39:07,441
Aubrey?

1209
01:39:07,861 --> 01:39:08,101
Yes.

1210
01:39:08,882 --> 01:39:09,602
And I'll be yes.

1211
01:39:10,763 --> 01:39:11,103
Awesome.

1212
01:39:11,403 --> 01:39:11,844
Okay.

1213
01:39:12,344 --> 01:39:14,305
So we have now hit the halfway point.

1214
01:39:14,725 --> 01:39:16,526
There's 10 articles in the charter.

1215
01:39:16,866 --> 01:39:17,827
We've approved five.

1216
01:39:18,627 --> 01:39:19,087
Wow.

1217
01:39:19,208 --> 01:39:21,329
Yes.

1218
01:39:21,669 --> 01:39:28,753
I think we did one, no, two, three, four, six, seven, eight.

1219
01:39:29,353 --> 01:39:30,294
I don't think we've done four yet.

1220
01:39:30,314 --> 01:39:31,014
Didn't we do four?

1221
01:39:34,783 --> 01:39:35,464
Or did we not?

1222
01:39:35,524 --> 01:39:35,964
I don't know.

1223
01:39:35,984 --> 01:39:37,465
No, I think- Or it's pending.

1224
01:39:37,985 --> 01:39:40,526
Okay, so next- We're close, 90% done.

1225
01:39:41,186 --> 01:39:42,167
Okay.

1226
01:39:42,187 --> 01:39:42,767
2, 3, 6, 7, and 8.

1227
01:39:43,508 --> 01:39:48,550
Okay, so we have not much time left, but I just want to clarify.

1228
01:39:48,610 --> 01:39:50,131
So I sent that document out.

1229
01:39:51,411 --> 01:39:52,252
I didn't do Article 1.

1230
01:39:52,552 --> 01:39:58,174
Article 1 is definitions, and I think that the Collins Center is going to draft that for us.

1231
01:39:58,895 --> 01:40:00,816
And the Collins Center is also going to draft

1232
01:40:01,956 --> 01:40:20,466
5, 9, and 10, but I just wanted to give examples of kind of what's in those to see what people want to, because what we're going to need to do is, we're going to need to tell the call-in center, please drop these sections for us, and this is, these are the key, you know, this is the key information that you need to include.

1233
01:40:21,797 --> 01:40:27,761
So I wanted to just do that one first and then talk about whether there's anything else that we need to dive into.

1234
01:40:27,801 --> 01:40:27,901
So.

1235
01:40:51,320 --> 01:40:53,902
Did anybody have a chance to look at it?

1236
01:40:54,002 --> 01:41:00,127
It's very common for the regular charter review to be outlined as every 10 years.

1237
01:41:02,869 --> 01:41:14,558
I would like to make a proposal that we say that the charter is reviewed five years from the adoption of this charter and every 10 years thereafter.

1238
01:41:15,594 --> 01:41:17,355
just because it's been so long?

1239
01:41:18,156 --> 01:41:19,797
That was exactly what I was thinking too.

1240
01:41:19,817 --> 01:41:20,538
Okay.

1241
01:41:21,018 --> 01:41:21,239
Good.

1242
01:41:21,319 --> 01:41:23,360
That means you're going to second it?

1243
01:41:24,581 --> 01:41:25,862
Yes, I will second that.

1244
01:41:25,882 --> 01:41:26,643
Okay.

1245
01:41:26,743 --> 01:41:28,945
Do we want to have any discussion on that?

1246
01:41:29,445 --> 01:41:30,386
I have a question.

1247
01:41:33,769 --> 01:41:37,932
What we're doing now, that wouldn't have to happen all over again in five years, right?

1248
01:41:38,052 --> 01:41:40,274
Or what would the review look like in five years?

1249
01:41:42,716 --> 01:41:45,058
It would probably look a lot like what we're doing now.

1250
01:41:47,539 --> 01:42:03,202
Um, but, um, but actually not necessarily, they might just look at, you know, the, the financial, you know, uh, piece and want to make, make, make, I mean, they may not go through the whole.

1251
01:42:04,035 --> 01:42:18,117
charter in the sense that, you know, they might just pinpoint, you know, a problem and kind of correct it without kind of redoing a whole charter, kind of like what we had the choice of doing initially, you know.

1252
01:42:18,778 --> 01:42:19,638
That's a good point.

1253
01:42:19,718 --> 01:42:33,000
I mean, chances are, yeah, they won't have to, yeah, they will maybe be, it will be quicker because they won't be writing a whole new charter, hopefully.

1254
01:42:34,715 --> 01:42:43,083
I would think they would be making tweaks and or, you know, taking things that, you know, maybe after five years, this didn't work so well.

1255
01:42:44,484 --> 01:42:45,505
We need to revisit it.

1256
01:42:46,727 --> 01:42:52,913
So just to look at kind of the typical language for this section that we've seen in other charters.

1257
01:42:55,865 --> 01:43:02,967
at 10 year intervals and each year ending in a five, the mayor city council and school committee shall provide for a review to be made of the city charter.

1258
01:43:03,127 --> 01:43:11,809
So that's the one thing that we have to decide is the timing, but then there's also this language here about who does the review.

1259
01:43:12,510 --> 01:43:21,752
And this particular language suggests that it's a, well, should we vote on the timing first and then vote on the other piece or discuss the other piece?

1260
01:43:24,814 --> 01:43:34,820
I make a motion to accept the five-year first review in 10 years.

1261
01:43:35,860 --> 01:43:36,181
Okay.

1262
01:43:38,222 --> 01:43:38,622
Anthony?

1263
01:43:40,463 --> 01:43:40,703
Yes.

1264
01:43:41,324 --> 01:43:43,005
Okay.

1265
01:43:44,366 --> 01:43:45,086
Oh, I'm sorry.

1266
01:43:45,326 --> 01:43:46,627
I thought I made a mistake.

1267
01:43:46,687 --> 01:43:46,887
Second.

1268
01:43:46,927 --> 01:43:47,207
Okay.

1269
01:43:47,267 --> 01:43:47,548
Sorry.

1270
01:43:47,588 --> 01:43:48,608
Go ahead.

1271
01:43:48,748 --> 01:43:49,048
Okay.

1272
01:43:49,148 --> 01:43:49,889
Anthony, yes.

1273
01:43:50,069 --> 01:43:50,449
Ron?

1274
01:43:50,669 --> 01:43:50,990
Yes.

1275
01:43:51,750 --> 01:43:52,050
Eunice?

1276
01:43:52,491 --> 01:43:52,651
Yes.

1277
01:43:53,807 --> 01:43:54,167
Aubrey?

1278
01:43:55,028 --> 01:43:55,248
Yes.

1279
01:43:56,489 --> 01:43:57,069
Okay.

1280
01:43:57,810 --> 01:43:58,250
Paulette?

1281
01:43:58,670 --> 01:44:00,351
Yes.

1282
01:44:00,591 --> 01:44:01,132
Danielle?

1283
01:44:02,212 --> 01:44:02,433
Yes.

1284
01:44:03,854 --> 01:44:04,234
Phyllis?

1285
01:44:06,695 --> 01:44:09,057
Yes.

1286
01:44:10,178 --> 01:44:11,458
I'll vote yes.

1287
01:44:11,478 --> 01:44:21,385
Now, this example language has a nine-member committee, all of whom shall be voters, four from the mayor, four from the city council,

1288
01:44:23,407 --> 01:44:24,068
Is that what it says?

1289
01:44:24,168 --> 01:44:24,408
Yeah.

1290
01:44:24,508 --> 01:44:29,653
And one from the school committee by the school committee chair and the city council president.

1291
01:44:29,673 --> 01:44:34,758
What do people think about that?

1292
01:44:37,517 --> 01:44:40,299
Well, I have a comment on the side there.

1293
01:44:40,519 --> 01:44:53,306
It appears that what we're saying is either the mayor gets five choices because she's the, because the mayor is the chair of the school committee, or the school committee will vote a majority vote to pick a candidate.

1294
01:44:53,466 --> 01:44:55,647
That's my only, whatever, those are the two choices.

1295
01:44:55,707 --> 01:45:01,630
To say, the way it's written now, the mayor has five appointees to that committee.

1296
01:45:02,070 --> 01:45:03,271
Yeah, no, that's a good point.

1297
01:45:05,464 --> 01:45:09,067
So, what do people think in general?

1298
01:45:09,608 --> 01:45:10,388
Go ahead, Anthony.

1299
01:45:10,929 --> 01:45:11,509
I have a question.

1300
01:45:12,090 --> 01:45:24,661
Now, I know in other communities and other times that, you know, the charter committees are actually elected by the voters.

1301
01:45:25,182 --> 01:45:28,385
That's only under Chapter 43B if signatures are collected.

1302
01:45:34,005 --> 01:45:40,289
So, okay, that answers my questions.

1303
01:45:40,429 --> 01:45:46,472
Yeah, theoretically, maybe you could put it into the charter that this committee would be elected.

1304
01:45:46,492 --> 01:45:50,154
I guess theoretically, that could be possible.

1305
01:45:51,335 --> 01:45:55,937
Why does the city council get to choose so many more than school committee?

1306
01:45:56,637 --> 01:46:01,040
I mean, I don't, this, like I said, this, I just, I think this is Melrose and I just,

1307
01:46:02,281 --> 01:46:06,705
You know, this is not anything that we discussed or decided on.

1308
01:46:06,785 --> 01:46:08,686
It's just an example of how it could work.

1309
01:46:10,007 --> 01:46:13,950
It does seem, well, if you said the school committee rather than school committee chair.

1310
01:46:14,471 --> 01:46:14,751
Yes.

1311
01:46:15,792 --> 01:46:26,340
But it does seem like, oh, this, you know, I think we've been trying to equalize the government more and all of a sudden it seems like, oh, the school committee is the stepchild.

1312
01:46:28,855 --> 01:46:31,096
What's going on here.

1313
01:46:31,116 --> 01:46:35,157
Um, so, I would want, I would propose like mayor chooses three.

1314
01:46:35,177 --> 01:46:38,898
Or sorry, we can make an odd number.

1315
01:46:39,298 --> 01:46:44,679
And then the rest of the rest are split between city council and school committee.

1316
01:46:50,307 --> 01:47:01,230
Wait, I would actually like to say that we do 11 because, you know, people fall off committees and, you know, so there's there's an adequate number of.

1317
01:47:01,910 --> 01:47:07,291
People, and maybe that'll make kind of make it a little bit, you know, more.

1318
01:47:08,051 --> 01:47:12,853
Even, you know, we can give a few to the city council, a few to the mayor, a few to the school committee and.

1319
01:47:12,873 --> 01:47:17,194
I mean, you know, we can yeah, so 11.

1320
01:47:19,422 --> 01:47:20,964
What about me?

1321
01:47:21,024 --> 01:47:35,157
I just want to say one more thing that there's nothing restricting in this restricting the any of these bodies from appointing someone from the council or school committee to be on the committee, right?

1322
01:47:35,177 --> 01:47:36,979
It's a good point.

1323
01:47:37,661 --> 01:47:39,323
I have a couple of couple of thoughts.

1324
01:47:41,045 --> 01:47:44,749
1st of all, I like Anthony's suggestion of growing the committee.

1325
01:47:44,809 --> 01:47:46,892
I mean, we were supposed to be at what?

1326
01:47:46,912 --> 01:47:49,075
11 and.

1327
01:47:49,916 --> 01:47:52,759
You know, we've lost along the way.

1328
01:47:53,860 --> 01:48:04,546
You know, several and we've replaced them with, you know, other folks who've come and joined us, you know, those of us who've been at it since the beginning.

1329
01:48:04,566 --> 01:48:08,529
I mean, I would assume that the next group is not going to have the.

1330
01:48:09,449 --> 01:48:30,540
enormity of work that we've done, but I think there were times, at least I've felt, and I think maybe others of us have too, we could have sure used more bodies to do stuff, whether it be holding public sessions and activities and showing up at different events and things.

1331
01:48:31,540 --> 01:48:38,306
or doing research and stuff, you know, and inevitably, you know, people drop off.

1332
01:48:38,927 --> 01:48:45,372
So I think having, you know, 11 or even 13, you know, wouldn't be such a bad idea.

1333
01:48:45,392 --> 01:48:54,661
And I also think having somebody, one individual from

1334
01:49:01,240 --> 01:49:01,961
City Council.

1335
01:49:02,281 --> 01:49:05,523
We've been, you know, we tried to do interviews with many of them.

1336
01:49:07,224 --> 01:49:10,627
You know, some we had more success with than others to get their feedback.

1337
01:49:12,068 --> 01:49:18,813
You know, I think it's been, you know, invaluable to have POET with us now for a good long while to get that

1338
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:25,903
School committee perspective where we've all learned an awful lot about that.

1339
01:49:27,684 --> 01:49:38,289
So, I think maybe having a sitting member of each wouldn't be a bad idea for them to be able to tell us firsthand, especially since they're going to be working with a brand new charter.

1340
01:49:38,309 --> 01:49:39,990
How did it actually work?

1341
01:49:40,790 --> 01:49:41,811
You guys had to live it.

1342
01:49:42,431 --> 01:49:43,572
How did it work for you?

1343
01:49:45,533 --> 01:49:58,223
And the other thing is, I think that it would be important to have a good diversity of opinion on the committee as well.

1344
01:49:58,683 --> 01:50:00,024
I thought it was kind of interesting.

1345
01:50:01,105 --> 01:50:03,526
It's a little bit of a different ball of wax, certainly.

1346
01:50:04,167 --> 01:50:07,669
But the mayor put out a call for

1347
01:50:08,630 --> 01:50:18,893
somebody for the Elections Commission, and I think they're required by law to have two people from both of the major political parties on it.

1348
01:50:18,913 --> 01:50:32,437
I think it wouldn't be a bad idea to ensure that there was some diversity of political opinion on this committee as well, and some people who have some real good working knowledge of how the city government works.

1349
01:50:34,123 --> 01:50:34,483
Okay.

1350
01:50:34,803 --> 01:50:35,263
Thank you.

1351
01:50:35,724 --> 01:50:37,164
Two plus cents.

1352
01:50:37,364 --> 01:50:52,848
We have very little time, so I think what I'm going to say is, for the next meeting, please think about the composition of this particular body and what we want to decide about that, and we'll decide that at the next meeting.

1353
01:50:54,489 --> 01:51:02,811
Were there any other parts of these sections that people want us to discuss and vote on?

1354
01:51:05,075 --> 01:51:07,979
I had made some notes in a couple of places.

1355
01:51:07,999 --> 01:51:13,046
I see you didn't include article 1, but I had a couple of notes from there.

1356
01:51:14,708 --> 01:51:17,091
I don't know if it's worth going through any of that now.

1357
01:51:18,053 --> 01:51:19,895
We don't have time.

1358
01:51:19,915 --> 01:51:26,800
Then I think over in nine, I definitely threw in some notes there as well.

1359
01:51:27,600 --> 01:51:27,961
Okay.

1360
01:51:28,481 --> 01:51:41,911
What I want people to do is for the next meeting, think about the composition of this Charter Review Committee, any of the other sections of these outstanding articles that you want to discuss.

1361
01:51:42,852 --> 01:51:46,893
bring proposals and we will discuss them.

1362
01:51:47,373 --> 01:51:52,114
Whatever notes you made, turn them into actual proposals that we can discuss at the next meeting.

1363
01:51:53,034 --> 01:52:01,096
Next meeting, we're going to wrap up Article 4, and hopefully we're going to wrap up these other articles by going through those points.

1364
01:52:01,696 --> 01:52:03,677
If we do that,

1365
01:52:05,773 --> 01:52:16,905
We will have enough material to hand over to the call and center and then we can talk about how we're going to structure creating the final report, et cetera.

1366
01:52:18,386 --> 01:52:22,791
And I also noticed in number 5, if you look at some of the.

1367
01:52:24,623 --> 01:52:30,208
Other charters that, you know, I think it might have been Pittsfield and Weymouth.

1368
01:52:30,248 --> 01:52:36,113
And I think if you look at some others, if you're interested in checking out some others, they go.

1369
01:52:36,133 --> 01:52:42,598
I think the title of that article is something about administrative organization or something.

1370
01:52:44,199 --> 01:52:55,869
A lot of the other charters go in-depth into a lot of the different departments within City Hall, talks about the Department of Public Works, etc.

1371
01:52:55,929 --> 01:52:58,551
I think paying attention to that as well.

1372
01:52:59,292 --> 01:53:07,699
If you want to do that, then bring the proposal about how you want to do it for next meeting.

1373
01:53:09,137 --> 01:53:09,597
Sound good?

1374
01:53:10,038 --> 01:53:11,960
Okay.

1375
01:53:12,180 --> 01:53:16,083
Before we wrap up, are there any members of the public that would like to speak?

1376
01:53:16,243 --> 01:53:17,184
Please raise your hand.

1377
01:53:24,851 --> 01:53:27,834
Okay.

1378
01:53:27,854 --> 01:53:30,056
I think we have four minutes.

1379
01:53:30,216 --> 01:53:34,319
We can always use four minutes, but I think we have our work cut out for us for next meeting.

1380
01:53:35,681 --> 01:53:42,724
And the other thing we'll do at the next meeting is determine whether we need extra meetings this summer.

1381
01:53:42,784 --> 01:53:45,766
And if we are effective, I think we won't, so.

1382
01:53:45,786 --> 01:53:47,867
That would be great.

1383
01:53:47,927 --> 01:53:49,227
I think we're in really good shape.

1384
01:53:50,168 --> 01:53:55,150
Give a 90-second, you know, overview of the final reports.

1385
01:53:57,491 --> 01:53:58,831
Yeah.

1386
01:53:58,851 --> 01:54:01,233
People got the example final reports I sent out, right?

1387
01:54:01,853 --> 01:54:02,013
Yep.

1388
01:54:04,013 --> 01:54:15,699
That just gives you an idea of the document we're going to have to come up with as a companion to the draft charter, which we're coming up with.

1389
01:54:15,739 --> 01:54:21,102
Then we'll have to do a presentation to the city council.

1390
01:54:23,384 --> 01:54:30,628
Once we wrap up next meeting, we will spend a few months getting that final report together and then

1391
01:54:32,633 --> 01:54:39,276
we will hand our work off and hope that it flies.

1392
01:54:40,496 --> 01:54:42,197
And we'll still be meeting in July and August.

1393
01:54:44,678 --> 01:54:46,058
Yeah, we'll discuss that next.

1394
01:54:46,118 --> 01:54:59,883
I mean, I think a lot of it is going to depend on, because I know people are busy in the summer and things, and I think a lot of it's going to depend on how we structure the work of creating the final report and how many people want to be involved in that and what roles people want to take.

1395
01:55:03,070 --> 01:55:03,711
Does that make sense?

1396
01:55:04,413 --> 01:55:04,593
Yep.

1397
01:55:05,535 --> 01:55:05,836
Okay.

1398
01:55:06,237 --> 01:55:06,578
Awesome.

1399
01:55:07,620 --> 01:55:07,961
Thank you.

1400
01:55:08,121 --> 01:55:08,963
Motion to close.

1401
01:55:09,704 --> 01:55:10,105
Yes.

1402
01:55:11,408 --> 01:55:12,070
All in favor.

1403
01:55:12,330 --> 01:55:12,631
Yes.

1404
01:55:12,651 --> 01:55:15,357
Bye bye.

1405
01:55:15,677 --> 01:55:16,439
Thanks everyone.
