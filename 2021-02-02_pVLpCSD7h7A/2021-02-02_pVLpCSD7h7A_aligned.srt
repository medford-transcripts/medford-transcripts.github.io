1
00:02:30,768 --> 00:02:31,268
Hi, everyone.

2
00:02:31,288 --> 00:02:31,828
Sorry about that.

3
00:02:37,971 --> 00:02:38,851
Can you all hear me okay?

4
00:02:43,733 --> 00:02:44,593
Awesome.

5
00:02:44,613 --> 00:02:50,335
Give me one second to pull up my agenda.

6
00:03:01,712 --> 00:03:04,293
I am going to start reading so that we can get going.

7
00:03:05,094 --> 00:03:19,483
Please be advised that on Tuesday, February 2 from five to 630 there'll be a communications engagement and strategic planning subcommittee meeting held through remote participation via zoom pursuant to Governor Baker's March 12 order suspending certain provisions of the open meeting law.

8
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:32,603
and the governor's March 15th, 2020 order imposing strict limitations on the number of people that may gather in one place, this meeting of the Medford School Committee will be conducted via remote participation to the greatest extent possible.

9
00:03:33,163 --> 00:03:45,866
Specific information and the general guidelines for remote participation of members of the public and or parties with the right and or requirement to attend this meeting can be found on the city of Medford website at www.medfordma.org.

So one of the call in numbers is 301-715-8592.

16
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:36,210
And the meeting ID is 923-9988-1674.

17
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:40,752
Our agenda tonight has two items on it.

18
00:04:40,812 --> 00:04:41,332
The first is our

19
00:04:54,467 --> 00:04:58,151
district-wide strategic plan, and the second is middle school orientation practices.

20
00:05:00,173 --> 00:05:02,736
So I think I will start by calling the roll.

21
00:05:04,057 --> 00:05:05,278
Member Kretz?

22
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:06,099
Here.

23
00:05:07,401 --> 00:05:08,061
Member McLaughlin?

24
00:05:08,702 --> 00:05:08,902
Here.

25
00:05:09,663 --> 00:05:10,123
Member Graham?

26
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:10,484
Here.

27
00:05:10,564 --> 00:05:12,446
So three present, none absent.

28
00:05:14,233 --> 00:05:20,695
The first topic on the agenda is starting to revisit the strategic plan.

29
00:05:20,715 --> 00:05:38,280
And my goal for the meeting today, because I had to cancel the January subcommittee meeting, was just to talk about sort of the thoughts about getting the strategic plan sort of back to the forefront.

30
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:54,791
And thinking really about a timeline of how we would like to proceed as a committee, as it relates to the strategic plan so obviously it's meatier than any given hour and a half meeting so I just wanted to have a couple of minutes of discussion around sort of.

31
00:05:55,856 --> 00:06:13,547
where we hit the pause button, I guess, at the beginning of the pandemic, and then what we're planning, you know, how we're planning to pick that back up since then so that we can pick that up, make whatever revisions are necessary, and continue to move through that process.

32
00:06:14,168 --> 00:06:19,972
So Dr. Edward-Vincent, do you want to jump in and give us sort of a

33
00:06:22,026 --> 00:06:26,348
a reminder of what that looked like back before all of this change has happened.

34
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:31,331
I was on mute.

35
00:06:31,751 --> 00:06:45,159
Yes, if it's possible, I'm going to try to screen share just so that people can have an idea of what the strategic plan document was.

36
00:06:45,859 --> 00:06:47,160
So just give me a moment, please.

37
00:06:54,489 --> 00:06:55,410
That's not what I wanted.

38
00:06:57,331 --> 00:06:58,371
Give me one more moment.

39
00:06:58,512 --> 00:06:59,232
Sorry about that.

40
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:05,116
I wonder why it's doing that.

41
00:07:05,136 --> 00:07:05,956
Do you want me to pull it up?

42
00:07:06,016 --> 00:07:06,596
I have it ready.

43
00:07:06,616 --> 00:07:08,237
Perfect.

44
00:07:08,257 --> 00:07:08,618
You got it.

45
00:07:09,558 --> 00:07:10,619
Can you see?

46
00:07:10,939 --> 00:07:11,820
You guys can see this one.

47
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,782
I don't know why it's doing something a little unusual today, but okay.

48
00:07:19,502 --> 00:07:23,884
So this is what the draft strategic plan looks like.

49
00:07:24,484 --> 00:07:45,814
It has our mission and vision statement that the Medford Public Schools is a caring educational partnership of school, family, and community designed to ensure that all students are afforded a safe and healthy learning environment in which they develop the knowledge, skills, and attitudes to reach their full academic and personal potential.

50
00:07:46,694 --> 00:07:59,862
This partnership is dedicated to providing all students with a 21st century education that will enable them to be lifelong learners and contributors to a diverse and rapidly changing world.

51
00:08:01,864 --> 00:08:14,712
Our four core values that the strategic plan is based upon are achievement, collaboration, equity, and support.

52
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:23,721
Under achievement, we had fostering student growth and achievement, fostering collaborative relationships.

53
00:08:25,002 --> 00:08:32,748
fostering equitable learning environments, and fostering a safe and supportive learning environment.

54
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:50,382
These are the four large bucketed areas that we are focusing on, which take all the work that's happening across the entire district and are showing what those bodies of work are.

55
00:08:50,982 --> 00:08:51,643
So under

56
00:08:55,141 --> 00:08:57,262
fostering student growth and achievement.

57
00:08:58,822 --> 00:09:14,911
Medford Public Schools will develop and implement cohesive district-wide curricula and instruction assessed through various methods designed to help learners reach their potential as knowledgeable, ethical, and critical thinking citizens.

58
00:09:16,171 --> 00:09:22,655
Beneath that bucket, or within that bucket, contains these four bulleted areas.

59
00:09:25,048 --> 00:09:34,938
using instruction that focuses on evidence-based responses, productive struggle, academic discourse, access for all, and feedback.

60
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:42,466
This was based on the five core actions that as a district we have been using for the previous years.

61
00:09:43,607 --> 00:09:47,872
And this is required to help us implement the curriculum frameworks.

62
00:09:49,515 --> 00:09:56,322
We also ensured that we would provide instructional technology that meets the curricular needs of educators and learners.

63
00:09:58,304 --> 00:10:08,994
Research and implement common assessments that address benchmark and interim measures in order to inform instruction and make modifications to our current curriculum.

64
00:10:10,432 --> 00:10:14,555
and to recruit and retain an effective and diverse staff.

65
00:10:15,155 --> 00:10:30,365
So within each of these areas are the respective hyperlinks where we talked about action items, outputs.

66
00:10:31,706 --> 00:10:33,207
Let's see if I can get this a little larger.

67
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:37,730
So under this,

68
00:10:40,551 --> 00:10:49,535
We had early indicators of success, what were the resources, additional resources that would be needed, anticipated outcomes, and a project manager.

69
00:10:51,456 --> 00:11:04,782
These were, all of these subcategories are the action items that we would like to be able to accomplish as a district regarding bullet number one.

70
00:11:06,097 --> 00:11:14,298
So educators will participate in ongoing professional development designed to address shifts in the curriculum frameworks.

71
00:11:15,819 --> 00:11:23,780
The outputs would be that all educators will continue to receive up-to-date current information on DESE adopted frameworks.

72
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:34,222
And so the lead people responsible for that would be our curriculum directors and lead teachers, where we would be going and working constantly in collaboration

73
00:11:35,241 --> 00:11:35,814
with Desi.

74
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:53,546
We are also committed to as another action item, providing professional development in best instructional practices, including evidence-based responses, productive struggle, academic discourse, access for all and feedback.

75
00:11:54,126 --> 00:12:06,193
An example under what could be classified as access for all is the current professional development being offered by Susanna Campbell that selected members

76
00:12:07,073 --> 00:12:12,057
including school committee members are participating in some of that professional development.

77
00:12:12,597 --> 00:12:18,321
So it's using the five core actions, but offering professional development above and beyond.

78
00:12:19,402 --> 00:12:29,970
And again, that would be presented by our directors of curriculum and instruction, our administrators and department heads.

79
00:12:33,204 --> 00:12:39,409
adoption and implementation pertaining to elementary science in the area of FOSS.

80
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:47,556
And we had timelines for what that would look like for all of the different pieces that were being added.

81
00:12:48,497 --> 00:12:53,281
And for every single bullet, we have

82
00:12:57,947 --> 00:13:06,910
Implementation of new social studies curriculum framework, K to 12, provision of professional development and materials to support these changes.

83
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:13,352
The implementation of the Commonwealth civics challenge for both middle schools and the high school.

84
00:13:14,932 --> 00:13:25,956
Review of new research-based comprehensive elementary literacy programs, rubrics to select elementary literacy program and implement elementary literacy program.

85
00:13:27,093 --> 00:13:41,566
Adoption and implementation of materials pertaining to middle school mathematics, illustrative math, curriculum guides, professional development training, refinement of the scope and sequence, use of benchmarks, and consumables.

86
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:45,710
review of available elementary math programs.

87
00:13:47,691 --> 00:13:49,973
Again, that had to be paused temporarily.

88
00:13:50,033 --> 00:13:55,158
We know we're going to start that up again because the math curriculum was 2015.

89
00:13:55,638 --> 00:13:59,882
And so Ms.

90
00:13:59,902 --> 00:14:07,468
Faiza Khan will be going through a process with the math department and math teachers to be looking at

91
00:14:09,457 --> 00:14:14,039
piloting different math programs for next school year.

92
00:14:14,899 --> 00:14:22,382
And some of this information was presented at the curriculum subcommittee meeting back in December.

93
00:14:23,802 --> 00:14:27,924
Determine a protocol for assessing instructional materials.

94
00:14:29,224 --> 00:14:32,946
Assess current status of instructional materials for bias.

95
00:14:34,391 --> 00:14:48,059
introduce a protocol and provide organized opportunities for peer educators and visits across the district, which the visits across the district have been temporarily paused due to the virus.

96
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:56,905
So these are some of the sub-bullets that are within every single indicator.

97
00:14:57,465 --> 00:15:01,768
And I'm gonna just ask Dr. Cushing because he also, we all worked

98
00:15:02,649 --> 00:15:09,588
on this but I'm not sure if there's a particular indicator Dr. Cushing that you would like to speak to.

99
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:20,180
I think there are actually two, fostering equitable learning environments and fostering a safe and supportive environment.

100
00:15:21,161 --> 00:15:34,252
So under there, we spent a lot of time really considering, looking at the equitable learning environments, really considering the access through multi-tiered systems of support and enrichment.

101
00:15:34,972 --> 00:15:40,197
We really focused on adding that enrichment piece that is not part of the Massachusetts MTSS.

102
00:15:41,885 --> 00:16:01,911
framework, but we wanted to add that here and you know you can see some of the things that we've added here, refining the district vision and creation of the MTSS and establish the systems within the buildings and you'll see some of the staff professional development and training that we needed to include but not limited to.

103
00:16:03,131 --> 00:16:13,236
You'll notice dyslexia, co-teaching, students who are EL, students with disabilities, social emotional learning, other enrichments, screening and data use.

104
00:16:13,796 --> 00:16:21,140
Obviously a lot of this was supposed to be done throughout the 2020-21 school year, but then something big happened.

105
00:16:22,361 --> 00:16:27,983
So we've been doing more triage work around these and other situations.

106
00:16:29,204 --> 00:16:31,605
Dr. Vincent, if you'll go back to the main screen,

107
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:32,685
Yes.

108
00:16:35,006 --> 00:16:46,648
And then, you know, really wanted to also, the last bullet in that, the, I'm sorry, not that one, the above one, the equitable learning environments.

109
00:16:47,028 --> 00:16:49,628
Wanted to make sure that we're promoting the health and the wellness of students.

110
00:16:50,429 --> 00:16:58,050
This is really something critical that we, that we're trying to focus on this year, given all the various things that

111
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:07,232
students are facing with the isolation and the inability to have normal interactions with their peers.

112
00:17:08,613 --> 00:17:17,356
So our counselors and others are working diligently to reach out to families, to connect with families, and to make sure that we're doing those types of things.

113
00:17:17,497 --> 00:17:22,919
But we want to make sure that we're developing a culture and climate action plan for our district.

114
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:31,882
We want to make sure that we're determining a method for data collection around school culture, reviewing the data to determine the next steps.

115
00:17:31,942 --> 00:17:34,943
So really doing a heavy in-depth data analysis.

116
00:17:36,492 --> 00:17:46,695
and really looking at what is our capacity to help create a positive school climate and culture for our overall systems.

117
00:17:47,735 --> 00:17:58,398
And if you go back to the last screen, I'll touch on one bullet in the establishing and fostering a safe and supportive learning environment

118
00:17:59,402 --> 00:18:12,848
So one of the things that a small group of us working on, and this is something that needs to be really tight and cohesive work, it's the continue to use and refine consistent safety protocols.

119
00:18:12,888 --> 00:18:18,190
Now those safety protocols are an immediate response protocols and other things like that that

120
00:18:18,667 --> 00:18:31,714
really need to be developed with a very, very tight group because these are really the security and support procedures for our organization, in addition to a great many other things.

121
00:18:32,848 --> 00:18:42,973
And so generally speaking, that's not something that's published widely because then it can give the game plan for what we are going to be doing.

122
00:18:43,033 --> 00:18:48,216
So we want to make sure that we're examining building infrastructure in order to support safe environments.

123
00:18:48,256 --> 00:18:58,802
So are there physical things that we can do to say, you know, a key card system or various things along those lines to improve our

124
00:18:59,393 --> 00:19:00,614
our building facilities.

125
00:19:02,155 --> 00:19:09,579
Really want to look at our threat assessment protocols with administration, our clinical and counseling staff, and our Medford Police Department.

126
00:19:09,979 --> 00:19:12,440
Want to make sure that we're getting people well-trained in that.

127
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:22,326
Myself, a few counselors, and Ofra Ziobro went to a training, I believe it was last November, prior to the closure, around threat assessments.

128
00:19:23,096 --> 00:19:47,593
how to make sure that we're not over-responding to a situation, but we're supportive in the response necessary, making sure that we're translating commonly used phrases into the language of students, establishing multidisciplinary safety working groups, and to compile all of the building safety plans and come up with a district immediate response plan.

129
00:19:51,460 --> 00:20:02,885
And so that's just one of the aspects of the strategic plan that we're actually very excited to get back to and work on and not focus solely on COVID.

130
00:20:03,566 --> 00:20:04,446
Dr. Edward-Vinson.

131
00:20:06,287 --> 00:20:06,787
Thank you.

132
00:20:11,569 --> 00:20:16,772
Wouldn't that be a fun day to not have to worry about COVID for just one glorious day?

133
00:20:17,977 --> 00:20:31,009
I mean, the interesting thing is I remember last March 12th when we shut down the strategic plan, the immediate response, and many other things where I was like, oh, we'll have all this time to do all of this work.

134
00:20:32,551 --> 00:20:33,592
I've never been more wrong.

135
00:20:34,922 --> 00:20:48,389
never ever right so you know I think when we when we left off this document was presented to the school committee and then it was referred to this subcommittee and I think

136
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:56,813
I tried to remember sort of my thoughts at that time and I went back and looked through some of my notes.

137
00:20:56,913 --> 00:21:05,357
And I think, you know, one of the things that I was hoping we could do today is talk about like the right ways to engage the community in this discussion.

138
00:21:05,377 --> 00:21:09,739
And, you know, I think one of the things that sort of stood out to me that I recall at the time was

139
00:21:10,699 --> 00:21:14,122
I read the mission and the vision statement, and I don't believe it's changed.

140
00:21:14,742 --> 00:21:22,769
And I think even pre-pandemic, my question was, should it?

141
00:21:23,069 --> 00:21:37,200
It's a big mouthful of words, and I think the sentiment is there, but I also sort of wonder if it resonates with our community at large, the overall mission and vision.

142
00:21:38,102 --> 00:21:52,017
So I think it's interesting that you say that because when we were working on the strategic plan, the mission vision definitely is a lot of words.

143
00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:58,384
But when we think about how can you distill it or bring it down,

144
00:21:59,658 --> 00:22:03,779
what are we really saying in Medford that we will prioritize?

145
00:22:04,499 --> 00:22:06,980
Yes, we prioritize educating the whole child.

146
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:20,804
We believe that since we're a school system, when we're talking about how students learn, what's happening under the instructional umbrella, it's about student learning, how are they achieving their goals?

147
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:23,885
And so achievement,

148
00:22:25,605 --> 00:22:29,707
was the term, but it's about learning and instruction.

149
00:22:30,468 --> 00:22:36,811
How do we want that to be able to happen in order to be able to work as a district, as a community?

150
00:22:36,871 --> 00:22:44,894
We wanna work together, build upon one another's strengths and provide students not only with adults, but all the way down to the classroom.

151
00:22:44,934 --> 00:22:54,059
I mean, right now we're on COVID time, but when we think about collaboration, pre-COVID, it was talk to your elbow partner, turn and talk.

152
00:22:54,819 --> 00:23:12,379
who's your buddy, whether it was at a particular table or a group when students would go and work on, you know, in the glory days when they could get up from their desks and go work in a corner of the room and they could pick a buddy or they could be assigned to a buddy depending on what

153
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:19,423
the specific task or activity was, but to promote that collaborative learning.

154
00:23:19,683 --> 00:23:23,705
And that's where that collaboration came from.

155
00:23:24,426 --> 00:23:26,687
How are we going to do all the work that we do?

156
00:23:26,707 --> 00:23:32,249
It may not look the same everywhere, but we want it to be done in an equitable fashion.

157
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:37,252
And that was where the equity came from and support.

158
00:23:37,695 --> 00:23:38,696
How are we going to do it?

159
00:23:38,836 --> 00:23:59,077
At the time when we talked about fostering a safe and supportive learning environment, nobody was thinking when we said support, a safe and supportive learning environment, we were thinking about a place where children would feel welcome and you could be who you are and learn and grow and be challenged.

160
00:23:59,677 --> 00:24:13,392
And now when we think about safe and supportive learning environment in COVID days, you have to have your mask, you have to have hand sanitizer in every single room, you've got, you know, hand pumps and you've got foot pumps.

161
00:24:13,932 --> 00:24:14,313
It's like,

162
00:24:15,604 --> 00:24:17,045
You've got plastic shields.

163
00:24:17,065 --> 00:24:31,196
Remember McLaughlin and I were just looking at classrooms at the beginning of the school year, and they were putting up plastic shields and little hooks, and kids could have a mask break and hang up their mask for a few minutes.

164
00:24:31,216 --> 00:24:32,337
At the time,

165
00:24:35,253 --> 00:24:36,634
when we were working on this.

166
00:24:36,714 --> 00:24:41,576
And this last kind of version that you're looking at was from January of 2020.

167
00:24:41,616 --> 00:24:50,681
But we had already started the work a year plus prior to that.

168
00:24:51,182 --> 00:24:54,924
But this was us taking all of the work that we had done from 2018 to 2020

169
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:03,748
try to bring it all together in one place.

170
00:25:04,108 --> 00:25:06,469
There are a lot of initiatives within the district.

171
00:25:07,389 --> 00:25:28,357
There are so many initiatives that are taking place within the schools and trying to say, as a district, we need to bring everything that's happening instructionally, social, emotionally, even from protocols and fostering and promoting a safe and supportive learning environment.

172
00:25:29,037 --> 00:25:33,558
we needed to take all of that information and have it housed in one place.

173
00:25:34,298 --> 00:25:48,342
And so that's what the strategic plan was, looking at all of the things that were happening district wide and dividing that up and saying, how are these pieces going to be executed?

174
00:25:48,842 --> 00:25:57,165
So from promoting the health and wellness of students, I mean, we've even said amongst ourselves, we know now that

175
00:25:58,105 --> 00:26:12,459
we're living in the COVID era, how many shifts do we have to make to some of the things that were already listed, which are kind of like practices that were happening, but now with COVID,

176
00:26:13,448 --> 00:26:14,308
What does that look like?

177
00:26:15,689 --> 00:26:16,610
And what does that mean?

178
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:23,973
We have circles on the floor and arrows and tape and to try to limit large groups.

179
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:28,055
So those are things where we had to figure out how are we going to adjust.

180
00:26:28,816 --> 00:26:39,321
And so those are pieces that we want to go back to the strategic plan and infuse those additional things that had to be added in order to make

181
00:26:41,402 --> 00:26:49,606
in order for us to function as a district, which at the time when this was created, no one realized what was going to be happening.

182
00:26:50,346 --> 00:27:06,233
So this particular strategic plan really was looking at, this was one of the requirements of NSUP, that every district should be able to take

183
00:27:07,093 --> 00:27:16,063
the instructional programming, the initiatives, and all of the things that you're doing within a district to be able to take it and bring it into one place.

184
00:27:16,804 --> 00:27:19,888
And for people to be able to say, oh, this is what they're doing.

185
00:27:20,188 --> 00:27:27,576
So if you think about different reports that have happened over the course of the year, and based on feedback from

186
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:30,160
subcommittees as well.

187
00:27:30,541 --> 00:27:39,389
So under category two, collaborative relationships engage in timely, thoughtful, two-way, culturally proficient communication.

188
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:42,873
So all communications are now translated.

189
00:27:44,575 --> 00:27:46,336
We are using different apps

190
00:27:47,337 --> 00:27:51,080
the talking app and different apps to help with EL families.

191
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,842
The teachers are using those.

192
00:27:53,762 --> 00:28:07,933
Most recently, Member McLaughlin asked us to figure out how to get the closed captioning added function that we didn't have, I think, on the previous Zoom.

193
00:28:08,373 --> 00:28:09,394
And we had to figure that out.

194
00:28:09,434 --> 00:28:11,015
But now, even for this meeting,

195
00:28:11,816 --> 00:28:17,378
for people who need to use closed captioning, that's another way.

196
00:28:18,278 --> 00:28:36,463
So if we were to click on this one, I don't think closed captioning was listed, but now we would need to go back and look at what does two-way communication look like and be able to say that closed captioning was added.

197
00:28:38,334 --> 00:28:45,863
So I don't know if that it's so it is something when you you you you look at the entire district and you say well what's going on here.

198
00:28:46,364 --> 00:28:53,853
Yes, the smartphone applications and and we had a new website that was deployed a year ago.

199
00:28:54,574 --> 00:28:56,716
that we're continuing to tweak and refine.

200
00:28:56,756 --> 00:29:05,983
But the new website that was deployed a year ago, the previous website, I think, hadn't been changed for probably more than 10 years.

201
00:29:06,664 --> 00:29:13,270
So that was a huge shift where something had been in place for a long period of time, and then

202
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:17,772
you know, to start off with a newer website.

203
00:29:18,373 --> 00:29:22,475
And as we continue to get feedback and continue to say, OK, this is what's pressing.

204
00:29:22,855 --> 00:29:25,477
This should be, you know, right on the top of the website.

205
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:30,380
We are working to make those necessary adjustments in real time.

206
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:40,165
But these were things that we were working on and saying, what did we want to be able to do to improve communications and

207
00:29:43,194 --> 00:29:55,650
having it housed one place so that as a leadership team, the senior leadership team, and working with all of our directors, all of our department heads,

208
00:29:57,082 --> 00:30:00,224
Everyone can speak the same language.

209
00:30:00,604 --> 00:30:11,211
Everyone can refer back to it and say, oh, yes, this is engaged in timely, thoughtful, two-way, culturally proficient communication with the Medford Mustang community.

210
00:30:11,931 --> 00:30:19,736
And when this was written, and from the time that we wrote it to all of the changes and shifts that have happened just right now,

211
00:30:21,677 --> 00:30:25,721
The strategic plan is something that is like a living document.

212
00:30:26,421 --> 00:30:33,828
It's not set in stone, but it lets you know these are all of the things that are happening within the district.

213
00:30:35,149 --> 00:30:35,349
So,

214
00:30:37,484 --> 00:30:53,889
that that's kind of you know where where we are so whether member graham you're saying to you know for us to revisit and look specifically at the mission and vision and um you know update it to 2021 um we could you know

215
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:27,045
definitely look at that but in terms of as a district and how we need to run and how everyone needs to be speaking the same language and realizing what are the initiatives that we're doing this is a document where administrators can use it teachers can use it so when you say we're working on x y and z it's in our strategic plan everyone's in agreement and so although right now in this format it's not for students but

216
00:31:28,252 --> 00:31:34,778
what students will be experiencing are outlined in detail within the strategic plan.

217
00:31:35,959 --> 00:31:37,280
Yeah.

218
00:31:38,842 --> 00:31:39,943
And I guess, you know,

219
00:31:42,278 --> 00:31:53,603
You know, one of the things that was so interesting about the reopening task force that we had is that when you brought all those folks together, they'll like really different takes on the same thing, right?

220
00:31:53,663 --> 00:32:01,987
And so it was, it was a really valuable exercise in just sort of understanding different perspectives across the community.

221
00:32:02,307 --> 00:32:02,467
And I,

222
00:32:04,208 --> 00:32:11,398
I know we need to sort of move on, but I don't want to not have sort of a set of action items about the strategic plan because it is really important.

223
00:32:13,527 --> 00:32:21,410
Part of me is, you know, wants to have some discussion about how we engage the community in this discussion.

224
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:36,796
And then I think the other thing for the school committee to consider is, you know, part of the value of the strategic plan is, as you say, like, so that all of the folks that we're asking to align to it and do work

225
00:32:37,836 --> 00:32:41,479
In support of it know what that work looks like and why they're doing it and where it fits.

226
00:32:41,979 --> 00:32:47,963
But the other value of the strategic plan for the school committee in the community is to say these are our priorities.

227
00:32:48,023 --> 00:32:55,329
So when we start to talk about budgeting and things like if we if we want to have, you know,

228
00:32:56,189 --> 00:33:04,256
If the website becomes the most important thing and we're not resourced to support The changes to the website that sort of get us to the strategic plan.

229
00:33:04,696 --> 00:33:13,063
That's a decision point for the committee to make In terms of like what has the community told us that they value and then how do we how do we take?

230
00:33:13,604 --> 00:33:23,292
The the work that is happening, which is all in one place Match that with what the community is expecting and make sure that our budget reflects those values.

231
00:33:23,412 --> 00:33:24,633
So I feel like

232
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:34,437
We have some work to do in terms of hearing from the community about our strategic objectives and maybe it's not about.

233
00:33:37,051 --> 00:33:54,682
asking people to respond to like the nitty gritty of this plan, because I feel like the community at large may not be positioned to tell us whether they like bullet number two, but they could probably tell us what they envision for Medford Public Schools in a broader sense.

234
00:33:54,962 --> 00:33:59,825
And then, you know, there's some work to sort of connect all of that together that has to happen.

235
00:33:59,925 --> 00:34:04,248
So I guess when I think about the work of this committee is,

236
00:34:04,888 --> 00:34:12,353
you know, and I want to open it up to my colleagues is what work should we be doing this year to engage the community in this discussion?

237
00:34:13,573 --> 00:34:21,838
So that this is a document not only that says, like, that's a report out of what we're doing, but it is a reflection of what the community thinks that we're supposed to do.

238
00:34:25,821 --> 00:34:29,003
Thoughts, questions, Melanie, Kathy?

239
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:33,980
Member McLaughlin.

240
00:34:34,821 --> 00:34:38,603
Sure, yeah, no, I think it's really important to be able to have some.

241
00:34:40,403 --> 00:34:57,091
Buy in in some empowerment in the family sector to the strategic plan, so I'm not exactly sure how folks want to accomplish that, but I think it is a really important piece in terms of, you know, looking at that at what that.

242
00:34:58,092 --> 00:35:01,153
Would look like and how we can actively show families that.

243
00:35:02,374 --> 00:35:02,574
You know,

244
00:35:03,077 --> 00:35:08,101
their concerns and needs are incorporated in the strategic plan, both short-term and long-term.

245
00:35:08,662 --> 00:35:17,269
And then I wanted to ask you, under the initiatives, Dr. Edward Vincent, it looks like those are hyperlinked, but they're not hyperlinked, right?

246
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:19,310
Or are they?

247
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:20,912
Are they hyperlinked to these documents?

248
00:35:25,507 --> 00:35:29,889
One second, I just jumped over because you were talking about family and community.

249
00:35:30,309 --> 00:35:41,274
I wanted to, I hadn't opened that particular bullet, but this one is, I think, capturing what you're saying, family and community engagement.

250
00:35:41,595 --> 00:35:52,460
It's hard trying to squeeze everything in to the buckets, but this one, fostering collaborative relationships, actively ensure that all families are welcome members of the school community,

251
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:57,525
who contribute to the classroom, school, and community's effectiveness.

252
00:35:58,065 --> 00:35:58,806
So that is

253
00:36:02,282 --> 00:36:04,162
Can we back up just one second, Maurice?

254
00:36:04,182 --> 00:36:11,064
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you, but that's what I wanted to ask you was that within those bullets, they're hyperlinked to these documents.

255
00:36:11,124 --> 00:36:11,884
Is that accurate?

256
00:36:12,624 --> 00:36:17,145
Is that what you're- Within these bullets, all of these are hyperlinked within the document, yes.

257
00:36:17,165 --> 00:36:18,565
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's exactly it.

258
00:36:18,785 --> 00:36:26,907
And so that's really useful with the hyperlink, because I was looking at this last week or two weeks ago when you were sharing it.

259
00:36:27,527 --> 00:36:34,869
and I noticed that they all do look like hyperlinks and being able to access the hyperlink is really helpful and then having the breakdown in these documents is really helpful.

260
00:36:35,569 --> 00:36:57,114
So can, is this document shared with us in a way that we can also look at the hyperlink so that we can just, I would love some time to just sort of sit with this and work with it and you know sort of link to the hyperlinks just to sort of understand the process because it's a lovely document and I think you've put a ton, clearly a ton of work into it but or and

261
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:05,125
you know, the color coding and the hyperlinks and everything, it's just, I feel a little bit overwhelmed and busy with it.

262
00:37:05,565 --> 00:37:11,989
So I feel like I just need to be able to wrap my mind around a little better, but please do continue with the hyperlink that you just clicked on.

263
00:37:12,029 --> 00:37:19,194
So show me which one that you clicked on to go to the- Fostering collaborative relationships, bullet number two.

264
00:37:19,214 --> 00:37:19,894
Thank you.

265
00:37:19,914 --> 00:37:20,815
And then we had,

266
00:37:27,479 --> 00:37:38,168
actively ensure, engage in timely, thoughtful, two-way, culturally proficient communication, work collaboratively with community stakeholders to funnel appropriate budgetary resources.

267
00:37:38,808 --> 00:37:48,737
So we really try to think about all of the components that are needed to help a district run smoothly.

268
00:37:48,897 --> 00:37:50,038
And so this was under

269
00:37:51,888 --> 00:37:53,569
fostering collaborative relationships.

270
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:55,851
So families and staff and everyone.

271
00:37:56,252 --> 00:37:56,612
Sure.

272
00:37:56,752 --> 00:37:57,192
And thank you.

273
00:37:57,253 --> 00:38:01,176
And can you do me a favor and click on the hyperlink like you were going to for number two?

274
00:38:11,902 --> 00:38:13,644
And remember, this was in draft phase.

275
00:38:13,664 --> 00:38:17,409
So this is what number two, actively insuring.

276
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:24,918
And then one action item was review and expand transition programs to support students.

277
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:28,122
And it listed several outputs.

278
00:38:28,823 --> 00:38:44,864
Elementary open house, kindergarten for kindergarten, building bridges, elementary middle school lottery open house, middle school open house, middle school barbecue orientation, high school orientation, ninth grade, high school open house for eighth graders.

279
00:38:47,092 --> 00:38:56,220
Increased collaboration and coordination around parent education, Medford Family Network, community schools, our Board of Health, PTOs.

280
00:38:56,721 --> 00:39:00,704
And so we had different ones listed.

281
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:03,527
Enhanced family engagement events.

282
00:39:04,107 --> 00:39:08,929
curriculum night, citywide report card conferences, EL family night, PTOs.

283
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:29,059
So we had staff, we had parent guardians, and I had a comment for me to add hyperlink to calendars so that if someone was in the strategic plan looking at events, they could get another hyperlink that could bring them specifically to some of the calendars.

284
00:39:29,759 --> 00:39:30,260
So this is,

285
00:39:32,296 --> 00:39:39,344
what we have listed right now under fostering collaborative relationships.

286
00:39:40,546 --> 00:39:43,790
And the goal is that this would be available to the community?

287
00:39:45,921 --> 00:39:47,702
Yes, this would be on the website.

288
00:39:47,742 --> 00:39:50,845
So once the... With hyperlinks.

289
00:39:51,386 --> 00:39:52,887
Yes, with the hyperlinks.

290
00:39:52,907 --> 00:39:56,010
So the community, everyone would be able to go in.

291
00:39:56,050 --> 00:40:04,778
So this particular one, where it's fostering collaborative relationships, this would get fleshed out a little bit more.

292
00:40:05,518 --> 00:40:08,781
And so here where we have PTOs listed,

293
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:26,943
It could be either a hyperlink or the different kinds of outputs, finding ways to concretely connect, whether it's with PTOs, with the Medford Family Network, who some of the point, who would be the point person.

294
00:40:27,283 --> 00:40:34,204
So if you were just a regular parent and not a school committee member, you could go on and say, oh, this is, you know, what's happening.

295
00:40:34,244 --> 00:40:35,924
And then you'd see this.

296
00:40:36,064 --> 00:40:38,745
And if we had the, whoever the,

297
00:40:40,058 --> 00:40:54,549
you know, elementary or high school, we could have the, you know, elementary-wide PTO rep or middle school rep, and people would be able to see who was responsible for that, for that particular task.

298
00:40:55,990 --> 00:41:05,517
And so they'd find access and we would just connect everything, but they would be able to say, oh, this is kind of the plan that the district is on right now.

299
00:41:06,312 --> 00:41:06,752
That's great.

300
00:41:07,153 --> 00:41:11,876
And so might I suggest that, you know, I think data is really great here too.

301
00:41:11,996 --> 00:41:15,098
Two things, Dr. Edwin would have said that I think would be really helpful.

302
00:41:15,658 --> 00:41:29,427
One is I think, you know, thinking about how, you know, there is a, even a family engagement opportunity or event, or I defer to my colleagues as well on this, on how we are actively engaging families in this process.

303
00:41:29,447 --> 00:41:33,710
So whether it's again, you know, longer presentation to them with feedback from them or some,

304
00:41:34,236 --> 00:41:38,498
import or even, I don't know, small, you know, videos of families saying things that they want.

305
00:41:38,538 --> 00:41:43,180
I'm not really sure, but sort of thinking about how that's a two-way communication I think could be really helpful.

306
00:41:43,280 --> 00:42:00,987
And then I would also respectfully suggest that the parent education piece, you might want to include the Medford CPAC there just around the sessions that they, the monthly education sessions that they host that a lot of administrators and teachers and families go to.

307
00:42:01,067 --> 00:42:01,327
And then

308
00:42:02,704 --> 00:42:03,646
Lastly, data.

309
00:42:04,046 --> 00:42:12,901
And so I think that for me listening to a lot of the strategic plan, as I imagine it can for you,

310
00:42:14,305 --> 00:42:17,107
It can feel like a soft science to some degree.

311
00:42:17,147 --> 00:42:20,490
It can feel like, you know, it's like nailing to a wall a little bit.

312
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:22,412
Like how is it quantifiable?

313
00:42:23,093 --> 00:42:26,175
As you were saying at the top, can you scroll up to the top for a second?

314
00:42:26,255 --> 00:42:27,116
Sorry, I have this document.

315
00:42:27,476 --> 00:42:30,739
Yeah, the indicators of success, right?

316
00:42:30,859 --> 00:42:32,020
Like what does that actually look like?

317
00:42:32,481 --> 00:42:34,543
So any opportunities to include

318
00:42:35,143 --> 00:42:36,804
data, I think, is really helpful.

319
00:42:36,864 --> 00:42:48,290
So whether it's, you know, two family engagement, you know, surveys a year, you know, where we're collecting data on how we're actually doing or I mean, that's just an example.

320
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:58,054
But I'm thinking about how are we how are we actually qualifying the two way communication, if you will.

321
00:42:58,134 --> 00:42:59,055
So certainly, it feels like

322
00:42:59,496 --> 00:43:04,620
There's a lot that the district is sort of putting their arms around saying, okay, this is what our plan is for family engagement.

323
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:15,547
But in order for family engagement to be effective, it's gotta be all stakeholders so that families are feeling like they're participating in this as well.

324
00:43:15,567 --> 00:43:17,609
So I'm wondering how that might be achieved.

325
00:43:17,649 --> 00:43:24,854
And again, sort of just throwing out some ideas for folks on the call and my colleagues as member Graham suggested.

326
00:43:27,513 --> 00:43:28,754
Thank you.

327
00:43:29,154 --> 00:43:29,715
Oh, hey, Kathy.

328
00:43:29,955 --> 00:43:30,215
Hi.

329
00:43:30,335 --> 00:43:35,820
Yeah, I don't know why, but it keeps on putting a hand up, but I was going to chime in anyways.

330
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:39,423
Do you see the hand showing up, or is it just on my side?

331
00:43:40,063 --> 00:43:41,044
No, it's so weird.

332
00:43:41,104 --> 00:43:42,285
There's a hand on my side.

333
00:43:42,445 --> 00:43:42,966
It's so weird.

334
00:43:42,986 --> 00:43:45,628
So as a co-host, the hands don't show up.

335
00:43:46,529 --> 00:43:47,309
Oh, that's right.

336
00:43:47,329 --> 00:43:51,693
And it's a little hand, and I can move it around the screen.

337
00:43:51,773 --> 00:43:52,233
I don't know.

338
00:43:52,834 --> 00:43:53,815
It's never done it before.

339
00:43:55,823 --> 00:44:11,413
But I want to chime in and just say, you know, I remember when you presented the strategic plan last year, and I remember how much time and effort all the administrative team, everybody worked collaboratively on this.

340
00:44:11,954 --> 00:44:14,275
And I do think it's a great document.

341
00:44:15,336 --> 00:44:16,677
I like the color coding.

342
00:44:17,658 --> 00:44:21,740
You know, I was thinking as everybody was talking about how could we

343
00:44:22,928 --> 00:44:31,234
easily, you know, get feedback from the community without creating another task force, because that's what we don't want.

344
00:44:31,294 --> 00:44:35,757
It just seems like everything we're doing now we're creating another task force to get feedback.

345
00:44:36,358 --> 00:44:38,959
Is there any way that we could, you know, maybe

346
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:49,005
If we have our initial strategic plan, we could share it and then do a brief survey to ask for some feedback and just have it broken down by section.

347
00:44:49,545 --> 00:45:02,633
I'm not sure, but I just think what I see us doing all the time is we're creating another task force and then forming another group and having another committee forum to have

348
00:45:03,173 --> 00:45:10,595
You know, several different communities because we want to make sure that we engage everybody in a very diverse group, you know, to hear everybody's feedback.

349
00:45:11,275 --> 00:45:22,519
So I just don't quite know how to go about getting the feedback, but I think that the hyperlinks are great and very easy to access and just clicking on the links and

350
00:45:23,259 --> 00:45:46,736
easy like dr edward marie she was updating the document while we were working on it so it seems like it's very user-friendly we could add information and edit it you know easily i just wanted to yeah yeah and i i mean i i think one of the things about being a more engaging school district is inherently that

351
00:45:47,709 --> 00:45:58,237
that's a choice and a value that we either have or we don't, but if we have it, it does take time to do that.

352
00:45:58,817 --> 00:46:06,984
And it's sort of, it's a choice that we are making to say we value the input of the community, right?

353
00:46:07,044 --> 00:46:16,371
And I think, when I think back to all of the work that we did over the course of the reopening, like before the task force, we had a series of round tables

354
00:46:18,093 --> 00:46:27,583
And they felt, you know, I think they always feel sort of wild and crazy the first time you do something like that, but I think they went really well and they were very well attended.

355
00:46:28,544 --> 00:46:36,153
And I think we could easily do something like that to garner the discussion that I think is really

356
00:46:37,595 --> 00:46:47,919
valuable in this conversation because I think it allows people to sort of share their perspective in a way that is not sort of like formed into a survey.

357
00:46:48,679 --> 00:46:55,881
But I will also say that during that process, lots of people reached out to me and said, gee, I'd love to go, but I can't.

358
00:46:56,001 --> 00:46:59,983
And like, why isn't there a survey for the people like me who can't attend?

359
00:47:00,143 --> 00:47:06,465
So I do think that from an engagement perspective, thinking about

360
00:47:08,005 --> 00:47:13,667
getting the buy-in of the community around what are sort of our goals, our mission, our vision.

361
00:47:13,687 --> 00:47:18,469
I do think we should consider a series of roundtables.

362
00:47:18,609 --> 00:47:24,111
It doesn't have to be hundreds of roundtables or anything like that, but it, you know, we probably just need to think about like

363
00:47:24,871 --> 00:47:26,531
Are they different by level or something?

364
00:47:26,571 --> 00:47:29,372
Because that was, I think, a challenge in our last set of roundtables.

365
00:47:29,452 --> 00:47:38,274
And Zoom breakout rooms have come a really long way since the wild assignment of hundreds of people that we were doing back in the spring.

366
00:47:39,294 --> 00:47:43,035
So I do think we should pursue doing something like that again.

367
00:47:43,055 --> 00:47:45,396
I think they were

368
00:47:46,462 --> 00:47:54,047
I think they were meaningful and I think we learned a lot about where the community's head was at that helped inform where we wanted to go.

369
00:47:54,627 --> 00:48:11,077
But I do think we should consider a survey of some kind once those are over that allows us to say, this is where we are, this is what we've heard so far, and now we wanna hear from you whether or not you were able to join us for these initial round tables.

370
00:48:13,379 --> 00:48:13,639
Melanie?

371
00:48:16,003 --> 00:48:18,583
Yeah, I found a lot of value in the round tables as well.

372
00:48:18,623 --> 00:48:20,324
I mean, that feels like a lifetime ago, frankly.

373
00:48:21,224 --> 00:48:24,244
But I did find that they were valuable to be able to have these.

374
00:48:24,564 --> 00:48:38,467
It's another reason why, you know, when campaigning, I love going knocking on doors, because we really get to hear other people's perspective and what they think and, you know, with all the nuance to it that you don't get from a regular sort of questionnaire.

375
00:48:39,227 --> 00:48:41,027
So I think that that's really helpful.

376
00:48:41,107 --> 00:48:44,988
But I also, you know, am just really feeling like I want

377
00:48:46,239 --> 00:48:54,845
our community to be able to have an elevator pitch that they know that we know that we all are on the same page of like, what is happening in our school district?

378
00:48:55,045 --> 00:49:02,530
Oh, anybody in the community would be like, oh, our, our school district in the next three years, we want to do this, you know, and in the next five years, we want to do that.

379
00:49:02,770 --> 00:49:06,993
And, you know, maybe two or three items under each of those and everybody sort of understands it.

380
00:49:07,053 --> 00:49:08,093
And we're all working towards it.

381
00:49:08,133 --> 00:49:08,694
And I feel like

382
00:49:09,394 --> 00:49:21,027
You know, to distill it all into sort of a couple of goals is, you know, I know tricky but I think it's something that is really important that everybody in the community knows what the strategic plan is.

383
00:49:21,827 --> 00:49:24,928
and can contribute to it and feel like they're on board for it.

384
00:49:24,968 --> 00:49:31,071
So I don't know, again, if that's creating a graphic or something that's sort of the cover of this that everybody feels like they know.

385
00:49:31,111 --> 00:49:35,393
I think the acronyms always help, Maurice, Dr. Edwin Vincent with the ACEs.

386
00:49:35,433 --> 00:49:39,135
I think that's always very helpful to have those for people to remember.

387
00:49:39,175 --> 00:49:41,396
But I think it's also sort of repeating and drilling and

388
00:49:41,836 --> 00:49:54,888
you know, getting that home to the community that everybody knows that this is what we're tangibly, you know, going to achieve in the next, you know, three to five years is I think important.

389
00:49:56,370 --> 00:49:58,452
So the intention definitely is

390
00:50:01,487 --> 00:50:10,276
The strategic plan is a multi-year plan, but it's really saying like, this is everything that we're doing and this is where we want to be able to go.

391
00:50:10,896 --> 00:50:20,986
As I said, when we presented this a year ago, that was based on all of the information and data we had at that point in time.

392
00:50:21,746 --> 00:50:24,249
And then COVID came and changed everything.

393
00:50:24,289 --> 00:50:24,909
It just like,

394
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:31,064
just blew it up and we had to think differently about everything.

395
00:50:31,425 --> 00:50:52,462
And so if we had to go back now and really look at the changes and immediate shifts that we had to make, again, like I said, to all of the steps that it took just to get to a safe and supportive learning environment, we could go back in and add all of the work that was done on HEPA filters

396
00:50:53,156 --> 00:50:58,722
air quality and air exchange because all of that also contributed to a safe and supportive learning environment.

397
00:50:59,242 --> 00:51:12,416
But what are the additional steps that we're doing as a district at the elementary levels when they have their morning meetings and really whether you are fully remote or whether you are a hybrid child.

398
00:51:14,328 --> 00:51:24,271
trying to create ways that before it wasn't an issue, but now saying, you know what, we need to try to create ways where the kids can connect or see each other, even if it's for.

399
00:51:25,769 --> 00:51:27,229
a small portion of the day.

400
00:51:27,729 --> 00:51:39,452
And so those are some of the adjustments that were made thinking about what was developmentally appropriate for our youngest learners, but also a way for children to be able to connect and feel like they're part of a group.

401
00:51:40,032 --> 00:51:50,395
So there are a lot of things when we say promoting the health and wellness of students, promote and enhance activities and resources that address the needs of the whole child.

402
00:51:50,815 --> 00:51:51,855
What does that really mean?

403
00:51:51,895 --> 00:51:55,216
What does it look like now as we're thinking about

404
00:51:57,637 --> 00:51:59,118
being in the COVID era.

405
00:51:59,998 --> 00:52:18,346
And this particular one, independently and in collaboration with community partners, provide families with information and resources to address their children's physical and social emotional development, promote community events for parents and guardians to support their child's well-being.

406
00:52:18,907 --> 00:52:23,749
And again, these were things that we wanted to be able to do

407
00:52:24,832 --> 00:52:34,615
And again, because of COVID, everything kind of, we had to push pause temporarily until we can get things to where they actually need to be.

408
00:52:35,535 --> 00:52:43,097
So that is just, you know, one example, but are we willing to do the work?

409
00:52:43,157 --> 00:52:43,477
Yes.

410
00:52:44,237 --> 00:52:52,380
Do we have a, to member Kretz's point about,

411
00:52:54,973 --> 00:53:05,265
The total number of roundtables in groups and what it is that we're presenting to the community.

412
00:53:05,526 --> 00:53:09,410
We have a regular school committee meeting scheduled to

413
00:53:12,552 --> 00:53:16,737
We have a regular meeting scheduled next Monday.

414
00:53:17,077 --> 00:53:26,307
And so we are going to be talking about the opportunity to have, maybe we wouldn't call them a roundtable, but listening sessions.

415
00:53:29,090 --> 00:53:32,832
We are going to be presenting at Monday's meeting.

416
00:53:32,852 --> 00:53:42,317
We'll be talking about that, but a series of listening sessions that we would love to have with the community starting in March, because February is an abbreviated month.

417
00:53:42,357 --> 00:53:43,258
There's a week off.

418
00:53:44,118 --> 00:53:47,760
And just trying to coordinate and plan all of that.

419
00:53:48,361 --> 00:53:50,182
We're starting in January.

420
00:53:51,002 --> 00:53:52,103
to plan for March.

421
00:53:52,843 --> 00:54:03,390
And it's not something that you can just snap your fingers if you want it to be done well and to be done thoughtfully with a desired outcome or a goal.

422
00:54:04,691 --> 00:54:07,472
So that is something that you'll be hearing about Monday.

423
00:54:07,532 --> 00:54:10,434
But you've got a preview tonight since you're at this meeting.

424
00:54:11,095 --> 00:54:16,778
And Monday, we'll be talking about those listening sessions that we want to be able to

425
00:54:18,471 --> 00:54:23,717
have with the community and be able to say this is work that we're thinking about.

426
00:54:23,817 --> 00:54:28,882
So I definitely am in support of getting

427
00:54:29,882 --> 00:54:34,465
feedback and having the community be able to talk with us.

428
00:54:34,665 --> 00:54:52,258
And again, in the spirit of equity, one of the challenges we had faced last time, whether we tried with the translation and different things like that, we knew that even though we had translators, we were still told like, this is not the forum or the correct way

429
00:54:52,825 --> 00:54:57,787
to try to engage with some of our population.

430
00:54:58,267 --> 00:55:04,550
And so thinking about that and trying to say, OK, how can we still reach the community?

431
00:55:04,650 --> 00:55:10,232
But at the same time, we may need to reach the community through more than one modality.

432
00:55:11,818 --> 00:55:36,221
And we're willing to look at more than one modality, but from a bandwidth capacity, not for lack of not wanting to do work, but really being able to say, okay, if we're planning to do a series of listening sessions starting in March, and what's the next step and how are we gonna need to

433
00:55:38,290 --> 00:55:51,715
deliver if we're going to do it by level, because again, elementary needs could be different from middle school needs, which are different from high school needs, because we're trying to do what's developmentally appropriate for the kids.

434
00:55:51,795 --> 00:55:55,977
So I just wanted to present that as

435
00:55:59,748 --> 00:56:18,644
We definitely have a desire and want to do it, want to communicate with the community so that they will support and be partners with us and collaborators with us to say, yes, we understand what's happening, we're with you, and we're gonna push this initiative forward.

436
00:56:19,184 --> 00:56:23,768
But at the same time, trying to manage

437
00:56:24,585 --> 00:56:33,167
when you look at all of these hyperlinks and what it actually means for the entire district, from content to curriculum to

438
00:56:33,643 --> 00:56:46,893
social, emotional wellbeing to, you know, um, Medford family network and connecting with other resources that are available and thinking about safety and security, safety, literally insecurity.

439
00:56:46,933 --> 00:56:53,878
But now in the pandemic, we're also talking about life and death and making sure that we're maintaining space.

440
00:56:53,998 --> 00:57:01,263
And, and, and truly when we say safety, not just in the words of that, the doors can lock or the doors can open, but,

441
00:57:01,583 --> 00:57:07,925
thinking about the health, the physical health and well-being of everyone.

442
00:57:07,965 --> 00:57:20,909
So it has, with all of this that's here, there is so much that we as a team, we realize like, wow, you know, we may need to add either, you know,

443
00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:26,523
how much more information we need to add to what was already there.

444
00:57:26,704 --> 00:57:34,092
And this document we're looking at was over the course of a year and a half, just to get to this point.

445
00:57:34,793 --> 00:57:40,700
And now we have all this new data that we still need to say, okay, where can we add that new data?

446
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:40,960
It's,

447
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:45,942
It's a tremendous task, but it's important.

448
00:57:46,362 --> 00:57:47,483
This is our roadmap.

449
00:57:47,544 --> 00:57:49,485
This is our blueprint.

450
00:57:49,505 --> 00:57:52,468
And we need to all be speaking the same language.

451
00:57:52,909 --> 00:58:02,799
And you need to be able to go to one place when you go to the strategic plan to say, well, what's happening in this area to walk away with

452
00:58:03,932 --> 00:58:10,234
Maybe you don't have a deep understanding, but a general understanding of, oh, this is what's happening in the realm of achievement.

453
00:58:10,754 --> 00:58:14,975
This is what's happening where we're promoting and fostering collaboration.

454
00:58:15,735 --> 00:58:21,197
And under that umbrella of fostering collaboration, family community engagement is huge.

455
00:58:22,577 --> 00:58:32,000
Whether it's listening sessions or round tables or surveys or all of the above at the same exact time for people to be able to know where to look for those things.

456
00:58:34,063 --> 00:58:45,534
So, just listening to sort of all of this discussion and thinking about strategic planning, you know the kind of strategic planning that I do in my professional life I feel like.

457
00:58:46,945 --> 00:59:01,019
I think where we're going is we need a path that does not require us to boil the ocean all at one time because we have other work to do around the pandemic and lots of other things.

458
00:59:01,099 --> 00:59:07,585
So I think if I were to think about a real simple sequence, I would say roundtables, survey,

459
00:59:08,766 --> 00:59:12,569
then a revision to these documents based on that feedback.

460
00:59:12,649 --> 00:59:26,181
So we would wait until we collected that feedback before we would ask the administrative team to go back and flush this further because these documents are supposed to live and breathe.

461
00:59:26,241 --> 00:59:30,444
And I don't want people to be burdened with lots and lots of revisions to this.

462
00:59:31,205 --> 00:59:36,689
And then once that third step of that revision is done, I think then the fourth,

463
00:59:37,857 --> 01:00:03,416
layer of that is like a time is timelining so to be able to say okay if this is where we're aspiring to go what does this look like a year from now and I think that's where your comments about like what is like what does this mean for next year is a really different question than what does this mean for three years from now so putting that timeline in place and saying what is what does this mean for next year what are our objectives for next year that sort of gets us to um

464
01:00:05,517 --> 01:00:11,699
I'll say a proactive discussion of like district goals and all of that good stuff all in one shot, which would be delightful.

465
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:23,183
But I feel like, you know, perhaps we can take the same approach to like the roundtables or the listening sessions that we took last time where this group came up with the agenda.

466
01:00:24,503 --> 01:00:28,505
work together to come up with the agenda and then sort of take it from there.

467
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:49,454
The one thing I will say is, you know, I think when we talk about how the format of those sessions, I want to make sure that it is the kind of thing that the entire school committee can participate in because it's really important for the school committee to be able to hear that voice of the community because we are the ones that will be faced with like things like goal setting and

468
01:00:51,495 --> 01:00:56,116
budgeting and prioritization and resource contention inevitably.

469
01:00:56,216 --> 01:01:08,180
So I wanna make sure that the school committee is part of those, which I think de facto means they are posted public meetings, at least in some fashion, maybe not with all audiences.

470
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:17,483
So what we could do is put a quick meeting on the books for later this month, since we missed our January meeting where we could flesh out an agenda.

471
01:01:19,792 --> 01:01:25,156
and then sort of revise the rest of our calendar which we can do at the end of this meeting.

472
01:01:26,718 --> 01:01:38,247
But we can't, I think this committee took on that work of the initial round table and it might be a good idea for us to take a similar approach and figure out what that agenda might look like for March.

473
01:01:39,048 --> 01:01:40,789
I don't know what you all think of that.

474
01:01:43,692 --> 01:01:46,294
The agenda for the March subcommittee meetings?

475
01:01:47,441 --> 01:01:51,022
for the round tables or the listening sessions or whatever you want to call them?

476
01:01:51,803 --> 01:01:57,765
Yeah, so the listening sessions were not specifically geared toward the strategic plan.

477
01:01:59,686 --> 01:01:59,786
Oh.

478
01:02:00,626 --> 01:02:11,591
So that's why I was saying that there's another series of meetings that we were trying to gather some preliminary information.

479
01:02:12,551 --> 01:02:15,052
So working specifically

480
01:02:18,365 --> 01:02:20,490
looking at the strategic plan.

481
01:02:26,138 --> 01:02:30,300
that would be, I envision it as another set of meetings.

482
01:02:30,940 --> 01:02:50,908
Would the meetings be so long that you lose interest, like especially with parents balancing kids and saying, okay, I have 60 minutes, I have 90 minutes, but if we get into like two and three hour meetings after working a full day, people do tend to lose a little bit of stamina.

483
01:02:51,388 --> 01:02:51,909
I understand.

484
01:02:52,209 --> 01:02:53,829
Get the freshest thinking.

485
01:02:55,150 --> 01:03:05,480
But we want- So do we try to do the round tables in April then, and then use our March meeting to define the agenda?

486
01:03:06,220 --> 01:03:07,501
Yes, that could work.

487
01:03:07,742 --> 01:03:08,262
That could work.

488
01:03:08,442 --> 01:03:11,685
We would try to shoot for April.

489
01:03:13,427 --> 01:03:13,567
Yeah.

490
01:03:13,647 --> 01:03:13,887
Okay.

491
01:03:14,228 --> 01:03:15,569
So that could give.

492
01:03:15,589 --> 01:03:18,732
Okay.

493
01:03:18,772 --> 01:03:20,133
And then finding ways to,

494
01:03:22,390 --> 01:03:30,818
You know, between now and April, you know, is there a way to like chunk it out to start thinking specifically about that?

495
01:03:34,054 --> 01:03:38,075
Yes, because there are some pieces when you mentioned the district goals.

496
01:03:38,655 --> 01:03:39,456
So the district.

497
01:03:40,716 --> 01:03:46,598
The district's required to have goals and within this strategic plan our district goals were embedded.

498
01:03:46,658 --> 01:03:50,279
These are our instructional goals.

499
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:58,665
for the respective departments that is something every district does all the time.

500
01:03:59,205 --> 01:04:16,658
So it is embedded within the strategic plan where we have the components about academics and social emotional learning and wellness and parent community engagement.

501
01:04:16,678 --> 01:04:21,622
So this is like, there's a lot of information embedded

502
01:04:23,167 --> 01:04:47,853
a lot of information embedded within, but it's critically important that we, once we get through all of the phases of finalizing this strategic plan, and when I say finalize, knowing that it's never final because it's a living document and that you'll continue to add to it, but at least where everyone is,

503
01:04:50,213 --> 01:05:12,053
understanding that these are the key instructional moves, instructional shifts, what's happening instructionally, what's happening social emotionally, what's happening in terms of family, community, and engagement, what's happening in terms of safe and supportive environments, and doing it with an equity lens.

504
01:05:14,679 --> 01:05:35,531
I think once everyone starts using this language and being able to tie it back to the language, so that whether it's to a point that you made earlier, Member Graham, about initiatives or topics that could end up coming up for budgetary considerations,

505
01:05:37,031 --> 01:06:01,038
One of the key reasons or key levers in having a strategic plan is if something is completely an outlier and you are not able to concretely connect it to the district strategic plan, then it says, you know what, it may be an important idea, but it doesn't align with all of the initiatives that are listed within the district strategic plan.

506
01:06:01,978 --> 01:06:14,085
And so when you're also introducing a new topic to say, yes, this is in alignment, it fits with our strategic plan and it fits under three buckets.

507
01:06:14,626 --> 01:06:29,375
And so this is something that we should strongly consider because it's in alignment with the district strategic plan and it's our multi-year plan and this is gonna help to allow us to execute.

508
01:06:29,975 --> 01:06:32,079
and accomplish the particular goal.

509
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:34,804
So I do feel that it is

510
01:06:40,650 --> 01:07:10,038
I know I'm going to represent my goals at next week's meeting, but one of the pieces under the professional practice goal was to move this from being a draft plan by the end of the year to have it listed as our strategic plan that is posted, knowing that it is a living document, but to move it from draft to our finalized plan.

511
01:07:11,522 --> 01:07:11,722
Yeah.

512
01:07:11,782 --> 01:07:19,445
And I think if we, so we have a meeting scheduled for March 1st, sorry, my agenda printed like this big on each page.

513
01:07:20,286 --> 01:07:21,086
So I can barely read it.

514
01:07:22,307 --> 01:07:24,948
So on March 1st, we have a scheduled meeting.

515
01:07:25,008 --> 01:07:31,430
So perhaps we use that meeting to talk about the, the plans for the April round tables.

516
01:07:32,051 --> 01:07:34,452
So I can take an action item to,

517
01:07:35,392 --> 01:07:40,036
start a draft of that to give us something to work with, as well as a survey.

518
01:07:40,096 --> 01:07:45,720
So I'm happy to take on that work to put forth something that we can react to in March.

519
01:07:46,181 --> 01:07:58,210
And then, you know, we would do the roundtables and the surveying in April, and that would give us like the, you know, April and May to do the revision, and that final step of the timeline in June.

520
01:07:58,270 --> 01:08:03,394
And that gets us to a place where that aligns well with I think what you were envisioning in terms of

521
01:08:04,315 --> 01:08:05,395
the goals for this year.

522
01:08:05,475 --> 01:08:08,477
And I think, honestly, that's super ambitious.

523
01:08:09,578 --> 01:08:14,581
It feels like you've been working on this forever, but it's also like really, really ambitious.

524
01:08:14,641 --> 01:08:17,043
It's, you know, a lot, you know, there's a lot going on.

525
01:08:17,143 --> 01:08:18,644
So I just want to be mindful of that.

526
01:08:18,724 --> 01:08:26,209
But if that timeline works, I think it just would require us to shift around some of the other things that we have on the upcoming agenda.

527
01:08:26,229 --> 01:08:27,650
But I think we have the space to do it.

528
01:08:28,871 --> 01:08:30,772
Does that sound reasonable to everybody?

529
01:08:31,347 --> 01:08:32,027
Yeah, it does.

530
01:08:32,147 --> 01:08:58,958
And I actually feel like it's really important because if we want to be able to continue to push the work, we need to let everyone know what this common language is and be able to just push it district-wide for everyone to know this is what it is, this is where it falls, and have people who own particular portions of the strategic plan

531
01:09:00,194 --> 01:09:04,378
continue to own it and able to execute it.

532
01:09:05,258 --> 01:09:05,459
Yeah.

533
01:09:06,279 --> 01:09:07,380
Yeah, I like that.

534
01:09:08,041 --> 01:09:09,782
So, when I look at the calendar.

535
01:09:11,607 --> 01:09:16,010
What would, so what we haven't gotten to tonight, what time is it?

536
01:09:16,771 --> 01:09:21,555
It's 10 past six, so I think we can cover the middle school piece briefly at the end of the meeting.

537
01:09:22,796 --> 01:09:28,420
But we can talk about, in March we can talk about the roundtables and the survey.

538
01:09:29,060 --> 01:09:34,564
In April we had on our agenda that we were going to talk about community engagement practices where we were going to actually be

539
01:09:35,565 --> 01:09:52,869
sort of reaching out into the community to try to understand if there are folks that we should be bringing into that conversation so we can set a more specific part of the communication strategy that we are sort of working towards as we talk about reaching audiences that we don't always reach.

540
01:09:53,369 --> 01:09:55,290
So I think we should leave that in place for April.

541
01:09:57,370 --> 01:10:15,708
which might be timely anyway and then move our discussion of the website to our May meeting and we can circle back around to the middle school and any remaining open items in our June meeting if that is agreeable to everybody.

542
01:10:15,728 --> 01:10:20,232
Yeah I think

543
01:10:20,910 --> 01:10:30,112
Yeah, it seems, I know it is ambitious, but I think we need to get it done and have it put in place and then use that as our starting point.

544
01:10:30,192 --> 01:10:34,453
So I think we should try to do that.

545
01:10:37,434 --> 01:10:40,695
Does that sound like a plan, member Kratz, member McLaughlin?

546
01:10:43,335 --> 01:10:48,957
Okay, so I will update the future meeting schedule and it'll be reflected in the minutes as well.

547
01:10:49,117 --> 01:10:49,777
And then I will,

548
01:10:50,863 --> 01:10:59,408
prior to our March meeting, I will put together a potential starting point for the round tables.

549
01:10:59,608 --> 01:11:14,917
And I'll try to think back to the million years ago where we did the last ones, but we can work through the revisions of that in our March meeting, as well as I will take a crack at a simple but complete survey.

550
01:11:15,157 --> 01:11:16,598
And we can look at that in March as well.

551
01:11:18,868 --> 01:11:20,269
Awesome.

552
01:11:20,809 --> 01:11:25,493
So the other topic on our agenda tonight was really around middle school orientation practices.

553
01:11:26,633 --> 01:11:32,397
I know we had a really good discussion about kindergarten earlier in the year.

554
01:11:32,698 --> 01:11:34,098
I guess that was November now.

555
01:11:34,519 --> 01:11:43,165
And it's great to see that the registration is out there and people are asking good questions and building bridges to kindergarten is like off to the races and that's

556
01:11:44,103 --> 01:11:46,704
way earlier than we've ever been able to do any of those things.

557
01:11:46,764 --> 01:11:49,106
So it's like very, very exciting.

558
01:11:49,226 --> 01:12:02,312
And I think this committee has an action item around middle school orientation practices, which is in a similar vein in terms of sort of understanding our orientation and lottery timeline.

559
01:12:03,833 --> 01:12:09,634
I don't feel like I'm a great person to speak about what we have done before because we transitioned to middle school in the pandemic.

560
01:12:09,714 --> 01:12:11,894
So I have no idea what it was supposed to look like.

561
01:12:11,914 --> 01:12:14,355
I just know how it happened last year.

562
01:12:15,755 --> 01:12:30,398
But I was wondering if we could talk briefly about that and just overall sort of thoughts and commentary around that transition process that happens in the spring and what you guys are anticipating for this year.

563
01:12:30,478 --> 01:12:32,898
And then we can circle back around to that in our final meeting.

564
01:12:35,782 --> 01:12:36,082
Yes.

565
01:12:36,482 --> 01:12:50,747
And I'm going to yield to Dr. Cushing in a moment, but at least during my first year and up until the pandemic happened,

566
01:12:54,175 --> 01:13:01,164
The sitting middle schoolers would go to the elementary schools and visit the students and talk with them.

567
01:13:01,325 --> 01:13:11,718
So the young leaders at the middle school levels that were at particular grade levels, they had an opportunity to actually go.

568
01:13:12,339 --> 01:13:18,162
and speak to students at the elementary schools and tell them kind of like, this is what middle school is like.

569
01:13:19,002 --> 01:13:21,844
And they were really excited about that.

570
01:13:21,904 --> 01:13:23,565
They were like the young ambassadors.

571
01:13:24,505 --> 01:13:34,290
And pre-COVID, when they had the open houses and the tours, the student leaders at the middle school level would, you know,

572
01:13:34,890 --> 01:13:36,311
be the tour guides.

573
01:13:36,391 --> 01:13:37,692
They would answer questions.

574
01:13:37,752 --> 01:13:44,297
They would publicly speak in the auditorium and say, this is about my school.

575
01:13:44,377 --> 01:13:45,577
This is what my school does.

576
01:13:45,637 --> 01:13:56,025
The students really had an opportunity to be student leaders and show the up and coming, the rising fifth graders or rising sixth graders

577
01:13:56,845 --> 01:13:57,665
what to expect.

578
01:13:57,785 --> 01:14:09,390
And so I just remember parents being very happy, excited, walking through the building, seeing the kids orienting themselves to the new structure, the new setup.

579
01:14:10,051 --> 01:14:23,216
So there definitely were a lot of opportunities for transition from elementary to middle school, and that COVID totally ruined all of those

580
01:14:25,197 --> 01:14:29,361
networking and connection opportunities because of group size.

581
01:14:29,481 --> 01:14:42,133
But the cookout and things like that, I'm going to have Dr. Cushing just talk about the cookout and some of the other things that happened as part of the transition from elementary to middle school.

582
01:14:43,795 --> 01:14:47,458
Dr. Cushing, before you do that, I think Kathy had her hand in the air.

583
01:14:47,738 --> 01:14:48,099
Kathy?

584
01:14:49,634 --> 01:14:58,878
Yep, I just wanted to just say that I have attended prior to the coven all the middle school open houses at both schools.

585
01:14:59,499 --> 01:15:01,439
And, you know, prior to coven.

586
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:04,581
It was a great experience and, you know,

587
01:15:05,081 --> 01:15:24,555
they improved the experience just the year before the COVID where the middle school open house was open and they had the student ambassadors and they also had parents, teachers, you know, give a little, you know, discussion.

588
01:15:24,836 --> 01:15:27,037
Students come up on this, you know, on the

589
01:15:28,058 --> 01:15:34,485
you know, on the stage to give a discussion and then split up into groups and everybody got to walk around and go into the classrooms.

590
01:15:35,085 --> 01:15:38,389
And they were doing, you know, a little mini science lesson.

591
01:15:38,509 --> 01:15:40,030
It was just a wonderful experience.

592
01:15:40,090 --> 01:15:47,758
And it's just it's too bad that we had COVID and, you know, the students didn't get to actually have that in the school experience.

593
01:15:47,818 --> 01:15:51,101
And I know they did the the videos that were done.

594
01:15:51,922 --> 01:15:56,124
I watched them and, you know, they were shared on Facebook and social media.

595
01:15:56,644 --> 01:16:01,426
And, you know, I think that's, you know, a great thing that we did, you know, for our students this year.

596
01:16:01,586 --> 01:16:04,747
Unfortunately, they didn't get to go into the in-school experience.

597
01:16:05,187 --> 01:16:09,749
And it was just, it was really a really nice, really nice job what they had done.

598
01:16:09,809 --> 01:16:11,550
And, you know, I really enjoyed it.

599
01:16:11,570 --> 01:16:17,292
And, you know, I went to both, you know, for the last, you know, four years I've been going, up until last year.

600
01:16:29,557 --> 01:16:30,097
Dr. Cushing?

601
01:16:31,519 --> 01:16:32,579
Ready to go whenever you are.

602
01:16:34,261 --> 01:16:46,550
So the game plan this year is to really start the lottery process after second quarter closes at the middle school, and then start working with our data specialist, Kim Miles.

603
01:16:47,791 --> 01:16:55,197
And we'd like to have the lottery done sometime in the first or second week of March, and then have an opportunity for our

604
01:16:57,103 --> 01:17:05,872
for our virtual open house and perhaps an in-person open house to occur this year once the lottery is completed.

605
01:17:07,213 --> 01:17:19,826
Prior to April vacation, I want to see where everybody is with getting the vaccines and how our operational situation might change once all of our educators are vaccinated.

606
01:17:21,020 --> 01:17:28,405
So it'd be nice to be able to do something more in person if that's an option working with the Medford Board of Health and Tony Ray.

607
01:17:30,606 --> 01:17:44,455
And then the cookout, you know, the game plan is to make this an annual bit of an orientation event with a cookout to cap off kind of the merging of four schools into the two.

608
01:17:45,744 --> 01:18:00,135
Be able to also have many clubs and activities fair where some upperclassmen would be able to show some of the clubs and activities that are going on for our students to be able to enjoy.

609
01:18:01,469 --> 01:18:06,553
We're also in initial talks about adding sports for our middle school.

610
01:18:07,434 --> 01:18:09,055
There are additional sports, I should say.

611
01:18:09,956 --> 01:18:15,161
So also give an opportunity and that additional sport is a middle school hockey team.

612
01:18:16,262 --> 01:18:19,525
So we're in those initial talks right now with the athletic department.

613
01:18:20,145 --> 01:18:25,330
And we'd really like to be able to have kids sign up for athletics at that time as well.

614
01:18:26,637 --> 01:18:31,959
So the cookout really is a great opportunity for the community to come together to support one another.

615
01:18:31,979 --> 01:18:42,622
And to really kind of have the two schools, the four schools come to two and then those two schools show the bonds and connections between the two of them.

616
01:18:42,902 --> 01:18:50,805
So looking to really start the lottery planning following second quarter closing, which is coming up here in just a few days.

617
01:18:51,476 --> 01:18:56,579
and then moving forward with hopefully the lottery in the first week or two of March.

618
01:18:59,441 --> 01:19:13,209
And Dr. Edward Vincent, do you plan to do, like I know the last couple of years because the lottery has been so new, you did a roadshow of sorts and you were out at the different schools talking about the lottery in particular.

619
01:19:13,229 --> 01:19:17,692
And I know that like the commentary I heard was that, you know, things,

620
01:19:18,892 --> 01:19:29,238
the nature of the questions really changed from like the several years that you have had to do this roadshow, where it's sort of more accepted practice now.

621
01:19:29,418 --> 01:19:44,647
And I was wondering if you were planning to do those again, or if there's an opportunity to talk to prospective middle school parents about just middle school and not simply the lottery, but about the transition to middle school at the same time.

622
01:19:45,647 --> 01:19:50,395
And I didn't know if you guys had talked about doing something like that or not this year.

623
01:19:50,416 --> 01:19:57,007
I would definitely be well I actually enjoyed the road shows.

624
01:19:58,278 --> 01:20:08,345
It was nice going to the different schools, being in the libraries, the parents were nervous, the kids were nervous, and it was like, you're gonna love middle school and just wait until you get there.

625
01:20:10,006 --> 01:20:25,476
And so based on what you're saying, believe it or not, it sounds fairly similar to what happens in our building bridges to kindergarten programming, where you have the parents come in and you say, yes, your child's gonna be

626
01:20:26,527 --> 01:20:29,912
leaving preschool and coming into kindergarten.

627
01:20:31,043 --> 01:20:33,724
And they're kind of like, well, what's going to happen?

628
01:20:33,764 --> 01:20:35,824
And you kind of talk about a day in the life.

629
01:20:35,944 --> 01:20:37,565
And this is kind of what it looks like.

630
01:20:37,665 --> 01:20:39,746
And you answer questions.

631
01:20:39,806 --> 01:20:42,446
And no question is a stupid question, so they should ask.

632
01:20:44,227 --> 01:20:55,110
And so we definitely, now that we've been doing it for a while, that parents may have specific questions or middle school specific questions.

633
01:20:55,530 --> 01:20:56,650
So we definitely could.

634
01:20:59,468 --> 01:21:17,559
when that time frame comes to be able to say, not only will we explain to you what the lottery process is, but also we're here to answer questions to say, what should you expect once your child transitions to middle school?

635
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:24,944
And the biggest one meaning being that your child will no longer have one homeroom teacher, but will go from one

636
01:21:26,070 --> 01:21:40,583
key teacher to four content area teachers that they have to be able to interact with all of these teachers who are teaching their specific content.

637
01:21:41,003 --> 01:21:45,948
That is a big shift for kids to realize, like, oh, I'm not going to stay with my same teacher for

638
01:21:46,488 --> 01:21:59,414
math and reading and science and social studies, that each content area is taught by a licensed teacher in that specific area.

639
01:21:59,794 --> 01:22:01,695
So that's probably one of the biggest shifts.

640
01:22:02,135 --> 01:22:06,217
But to be able to just talk about that and answer questions

641
01:22:07,938 --> 01:22:10,680
you know, the team, we definitely would be willing to do that.

642
01:22:11,521 --> 01:22:19,528
We want it to be a smooth transition for the students, first and foremost, but also a smooth transition for the parents.

643
01:22:21,910 --> 01:22:23,271
I think that would be wonderful.

644
01:22:23,291 --> 01:22:23,831
We have

645
01:22:28,397 --> 01:22:40,523
seven minutes left and there is currently a goal to leave meetings just minutes early in our subcommittee so I don't want to be the one that doesn't do that.

646
01:22:41,044 --> 01:22:46,867
So I didn't know Kathy and Melanie if you had any other questions or thoughts or comments about the middle school

647
01:22:48,207 --> 01:23:09,325
process but certainly when we do the minutes next week we can cover the the timeline that we can make sure we I can make sure I talk about the timeline if you don't have plans to present it otherwise just so that anybody listening can hear that directly from the minutes of this meeting that if they weren't able to attend so we can do that either way.

648
01:23:12,455 --> 01:23:13,196
questions.

649
01:23:13,396 --> 01:23:14,577
I think that sounds good.

650
01:23:14,637 --> 01:23:17,118
I'm sounds good to make a motion to adjourn.

651
01:23:17,138 --> 01:23:20,860
But also, um, no, it's not just a, um, an effort.

652
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:22,922
Jenny, we're gonna have we are having a little competition.

653
01:23:22,942 --> 01:23:26,844
We need a little prize at the end of the year.

654
01:23:27,184 --> 01:23:28,505
Really, really get this rolling.

655
01:23:28,545 --> 01:23:31,667
But Melanie is stretching out the end of my meeting.

656
01:23:33,548 --> 01:23:35,569
I am no motion to adjourn.

657
01:23:35,970 --> 01:23:36,330
Thank you.

658
01:23:36,450 --> 01:23:36,930
Second.

659
01:23:42,299 --> 01:23:43,863
Okay, so motion to adjourn.

660
01:23:44,123 --> 01:23:44,905
Member McLaughlin?

661
01:23:46,309 --> 01:23:46,629
Yes.

662
01:23:47,291 --> 01:23:47,852
Member Kretz?

663
01:23:48,333 --> 01:23:48,514
Yes.

664
01:23:49,275 --> 01:23:50,137
Member Graham, yes.

665
01:23:50,378 --> 01:23:52,643
So three in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

666
01:23:52,864 --> 01:23:53,585
Meeting is adjourned.

667
01:23:53,846 --> 01:23:54,347
Thanks, everyone.

668
01:23:54,367 --> 01:23:54,768
Thank you.
