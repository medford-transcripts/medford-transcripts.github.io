    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=150.768s">Hi,</a>  everyone.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=151.288s">Sorry</a>  about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=157.971s">Can</a>  you all hear me okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=163.733s">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=164.613s">Give</a>  me one second to pull up my agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=181.712s">I</a>  am going to start reading so that we can get going. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=185.094s">Please</a>  be advised that on Tuesday, February 2 from five to 630 there'll be a communications engagement and strategic planning subcommittee meeting held through remote participation via zoom pursuant to Governor Baker's March 12 order suspending certain provisions of the open meeting law. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=201.52s">and</a>  the governor's March 15th, 2020 order imposing strict limitations on the number of people that may gather in one place, this meeting of the Medford School Committee will be conducted via remote participation to the greatest extent possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=213.163s">Specific</a>  information and the general guidelines for remote participation of members of the public and or parties with the right and or requirement to attend this meeting can be found on the city of Medford website at www.medfordma.org. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=226.885s">For</a>  this meeting, members of the public who wish to listen or watch the meeting may do so by accessing the meeting link contained herein. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=233.608s">No</a>  in-person attendance of members of the public will be permitted, but every effort will be made to ensure that the public can adequately access the proceedings in real time via technological means. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=243.051s">In</a>  the event that we are unable to do so despite best efforts, we will post on the city of Medford and Medford community media websites and audio or video recording transcript or other comprehensive record of the proceedings as soon as possible after the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=256.125s">The</a>  meeting can be viewed from Medford community media on Comcast channel 15 and Verizon channel 45 from five to 630. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=264.846s">Since</a>  the meeting will be held remotely participants can call or log in by using the following link or call in number. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=271.869s">So</a>  one of the call in numbers is 301-715-8592. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=274.63s">And</a>  the meeting ID is 923-9988-1674. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=276.31s">Our</a>  agenda tonight has two items on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=280.812s">The</a>  first is our <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=294.467s">district-wide</a>  strategic plan, and the second is middle school orientation practices. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=300.173s">So</a>  I think I will start by calling the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=304.057s">Member</a>  Kreatz? <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=305.939s">Here.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=307.401s">Member</a>  McLaughlin? <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=308.702s">Here.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=309.663s">Member</a>  Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=310.243s">Here.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=310.564s">So</a>  three present, none absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=314.233s">The</a>  first topic on the agenda is starting to revisit the strategic plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=320.715s">And</a>  my goal for the meeting today, because I had to cancel the January subcommittee meeting, was just to talk about sort of the thoughts about getting the strategic plan sort of back to the forefront. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=339.12s">And</a>  thinking really about a timeline of how we would like to proceed as a committee, as it relates to the strategic plan so obviously it's meatier than any given hour and a half meeting so I just wanted to have a couple of minutes of discussion around sort of. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=355.856s">where</a>  we hit the pause button, I guess, at the beginning of the pandemic, and then what we're planning, you know, how we're planning to pick that back up since then so that we can pick that up, make whatever revisions are necessary, and continue to move through that process. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=374.168s">So</a>  Dr. Edward-Vincent, do you want to jump in and give us sort of a <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=382.026s">a</a>  reminder of what that looked like back before all of this change has happened.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=390.59s">I</a>  was on mute. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=391.751s">Yes,</a>  if it's possible, I'm going to try to screen share just so that people can have an idea of what the strategic plan document was. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=405.859s">So</a>  just give me a moment, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=414.489s">That's</a>  not what I wanted. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=417.331s">Give</a>  me one more moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=418.512s">Sorry</a>  about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=421.854s">I</a>  wonder why it's doing that.</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=425.136s">Do</a>  you want me to pull it up? <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=426.016s">I</a>  have it ready.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=426.616s">Perfect.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=428.257s">You</a>  got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=429.558s">Can</a>  you see? <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=430.939s">You</a>  guys can see this one. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=431.84s">I</a>  don't know why it's doing something a little unusual today, but okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=439.502s">So</a>  this is what the draft strategic plan looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=444.484s">It</a>  has our mission and vision statement that the Medford Public Schools is a caring educational partnership of school, family, and community designed to ensure that all students are afforded a safe and healthy learning environment in which they develop the knowledge, skills, and attitudes to reach their full academic and personal potential. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=466.694s">This</a>  partnership is dedicated to providing all students with a 21st century education that will enable them to be lifelong learners and contributors to a diverse and rapidly changing world. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=481.864s">Our</a>  four core values that the strategic plan is based upon are achievement, collaboration, equity, and support. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=496.56s">Under</a>  achievement, we had fostering student growth and achievement, fostering collaborative relationships. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=505.002s">fostering</a>  equitable learning environments, and fostering a safe and supportive learning environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=513.889s">These</a>  are the four large bucketed areas that we are focusing on, which take all the work that's happening across the entire district and are showing what those bodies of work are. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=530.982s">So</a>  under <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=535.141s">fostering</a>  student growth and achievement. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=538.822s">Medford</a>  Public Schools will develop and implement cohesive district-wide curricula and instruction assessed through various methods designed to help learners reach their potential as knowledgeable, ethical, and critical thinking citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=556.171s">Beneath</a>  that bucket, or within that bucket, contains these four bulleted areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=565.048s">using</a>  instruction that focuses on evidence-based responses, productive struggle, academic discourse, access for all, and feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=576.08s">This</a>  was based on the five core actions that as a district we have been using for the previous years. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=583.607s">And</a>  this is required to help us implement the curriculum frameworks. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=589.515s">We</a>  also ensured that we would provide instructional technology that meets the curricular needs of educators and learners. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=598.304s">Research</a>  and implement common assessments that address benchmark and interim measures in order to inform instruction and make modifications to our current curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=610.432s">and</a>  to recruit and retain an effective and diverse staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=615.155s">So</a>  within each of these areas are the respective hyperlinks where we talked about action items, outputs. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=631.706s">Let's</a>  see if I can get this a little larger. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=636.79s">So</a>  under this, <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=640.551s">We</a>  had early indicators of success, what were the resources, additional resources that would be needed, anticipated outcomes, and a project manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=651.456s">These</a>  were, all of these subcategories are the action items that we would like to be able to accomplish as a district regarding bullet number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=666.097s">So</a>  educators will participate in ongoing professional development designed to address shifts in the curriculum frameworks. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=675.819s">The</a>  outputs would be that all educators will continue to receive up-to-date current information on DESE adopted frameworks. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=684.44s">And</a>  so the lead people responsible for that would be our curriculum directors and lead teachers, where we would be going and working constantly in collaboration <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=695.241s">with</a>  Desi. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=698.497s">We</a>  are also committed to as another action item, providing professional development in best instructional practices, including evidence-based responses, productive struggle, academic discourse, access for all and feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=714.126s">An</a>  example under what could be classified as access for all is the current professional development being offered by Susanna Campbell that selected members <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=727.073s">including</a>  school committee members are participating in some of that professional development. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=732.597s">So</a>  it's using the five core actions, but offering professional development above and beyond. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=739.402s">And</a>  again, that would be presented by our directors of curriculum and instruction, our administrators and department heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=753.204s">adoption</a>  and implementation pertaining to elementary science in the area of FOSS. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=760.77s">And</a>  we had timelines for what that would look like for all of the different pieces that were being added. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=768.497s">And</a>  for every single bullet, we have <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=777.947s">Implementation</a>  of new social studies curriculum framework, K to 12, provision of professional development and materials to support these changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=787.69s">The</a>  implementation of the Commonwealth civics challenge for both middle schools and the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=794.932s">Review</a>  of new research-based comprehensive elementary literacy programs, rubrics to select elementary literacy program and implement elementary literacy program. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=807.093s">Adoption</a>  and implementation of materials pertaining to middle school mathematics, illustrative math, curriculum guides, professional development training, refinement of the scope and sequence, use of benchmarks, and consumables. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=822.527s">review</a>  of available elementary math programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=827.691s">Again,</a>  that had to be paused temporarily. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=830.033s">We</a>  know we're going to start that up again because the math curriculum was 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=835.638s">And</a>  so Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=839.902s">Faiza</a>  Khan will be going through a process with the math department and math teachers to be looking at <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=849.457s">piloting</a>  different math programs for next school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=854.899s">And</a>  some of this information was presented at the curriculum subcommittee meeting back in December. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=863.802s">Determine</a>  a protocol for assessing instructional materials. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=869.224s">Assess</a>  current status of instructional materials for bias. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=874.391s">introduce</a>  a protocol and provide organized opportunities for peer educators and visits across the district, which the visits across the district have been temporarily paused due to the virus. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=889.16s">So</a>  these are some of the sub-bullets that are within every single indicator. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=897.465s">And</a>  I'm gonna just ask Dr. Cushing because he also, we all worked <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=902.649s">on</a>  this but I'm not sure if there's a particular indicator Dr. Cushing that you would like to speak to.</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=912.453s">I</a>  think there are actually two, fostering equitable learning environments and fostering a safe and supportive environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=921.161s">So</a>  under there, we spent a lot of time really considering, looking at the equitable learning environments, really considering the access through multi-tiered systems of support and enrichment. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=934.972s">We</a>  really focused on adding that enrichment piece that is not part of the Massachusetts MTSS. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=941.885s">framework,</a>  but we wanted to add that here and you know you can see some of the things that we've added here, refining the district vision and creation of the MTSS and establish the systems within the buildings and you'll see some of the staff professional development and training that we needed to include but not limited to. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=963.131s">You'll</a>  notice dyslexia, co-teaching, students who are EL, students with disabilities, social emotional learning, other enrichments, screening and data use. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=973.796s">Obviously</a>  a lot of this was supposed to be done throughout the 2020-21 school year, but then something big happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=982.361s">So</a>  we've been doing more triage work around these and other situations. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=989.204s">Dr.</a>  Vincent, if you'll go back to the main screen, <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=992.425s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=995.006s">And</a>  then, you know, really wanted to also, the last bullet in that, the, I'm sorry, not that one, the above one, the equitable learning environments. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1007.028s">Wanted</a>  to make sure that we're promoting the health and the wellness of students. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1010.429s">This</a>  is really something critical that we, that we're trying to focus on this year, given all the various things that <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1018.5s">students</a>  are facing with the isolation and the inability to have normal interactions with their peers. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1028.613s">So</a>  our Councilors and others are working diligently to reach out to families, to connect with families, and to make sure that we're doing those types of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1037.497s">But</a>  we want to make sure that we're developing a culture and climate action plan for our district. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1042.959s">We</a>  want to make sure that we're determining a method for data collection around school culture, reviewing the data to determine the next steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1051.942s">So</a>  really doing a heavy in-depth data analysis. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1056.492s">and</a>  really looking at what is our capacity to help create a positive school climate and culture for our overall systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1067.735s">And</a>  if you go back to the last screen, I'll touch on one bullet in the establishing and fostering a safe and supportive learning environment <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1079.402s">So</a>  one of the things that a small group of us working on, and this is something that needs to be really tight and cohesive work, it's the continue to use and refine consistent safety protocols. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1092.888s">Now</a>  those safety protocols are an immediate response protocols and other things like that that <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1098.667s">really</a>  need to be developed with a very, very tight group because these are really the security and support procedures for our organization, in addition to a great many other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1112.848s">And</a>  so generally speaking, that's not something that's published widely because then it can give the game plan for what we are going to be doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1123.033s">So</a>  we want to make sure that we're examining building infrastructure in order to support safe environments. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1128.256s">So</a>  are there physical things that we can do to say, you know, a key card system or various things along those lines to improve our <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1139.393s">our</a>  building facilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1142.155s">Really</a>  want to look at our threat assessment protocols with administration, our clinical and counseling staff, and our Medford Police Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1149.979s">Want</a>  to make sure that we're getting people well-trained in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1152.5s">Myself,</a>  a few Councilors, and Ofra Ziobro went to a training, I believe it was last November, prior to the closure, around threat assessments. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1163.096s">how</a>  to make sure that we're not over-responding to a situation, but we're supportive in the response necessary, making sure that we're translating commonly used phrases into the language of students, establishing multidisciplinary safety working groups, and to compile all of the building safety plans and come up with a district immediate response plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1191.46s">And</a>  so that's just one of the aspects of the strategic plan that we're actually very excited to get back to and work on and not focus solely on COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1203.566s">Dr.</a>  Edward-Vinson.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1206.287s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1211.569s">Wouldn't</a>  that be a fun day to not have to worry about COVID for just one glorious day?</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1217.977s">I</a>  mean, the interesting thing is I remember last March 12th when we shut down the strategic plan, the immediate response, and many other things where I was like, oh, we'll have all this time to do all of this work. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1232.551s">I've</a>  never been more wrong.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1234.922s">never</a>  ever right so you know I think when we when we left off this document was presented to the school committee and then it was referred to this subcommittee and I think <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1250.17s">I</a>  tried to remember sort of my thoughts at that time and I went back and looked through some of my notes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1256.913s">And</a>  I think, you know, one of the things that I was hoping we could do today is talk about like the right ways to engage the community in this discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1265.377s">And,</a>  you know, I think one of the things that sort of stood out to me that I recall at the time was <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1270.699s">I</a>  read the mission and the vision statement, and I don't believe it's changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1274.742s">And</a>  I think even pre-pandemic, my question was, should it? <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1283.069s">It's</a>  a big mouthful of words, and I think the sentiment is there, but I also sort of wonder if it resonates with our community at large, the overall mission and vision.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1298.102s">So</a>  I think it's interesting that you say that because when we were working on the strategic plan, the mission vision definitely is a lot of words. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1313.559s">But</a>  when we think about how can you distill it or bring it down, <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1319.658s">what</a>  are we really saying in Medford that we will prioritize? <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1324.499s">Yes,</a>  we prioritize educating the whole child. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1327.58s">We</a>  believe that since we're a school system, when we're talking about how students learn, what's happening under the instructional umbrella, it's about student learning, how are they achieving their goals? <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1342.424s">And</a>  so achievement, <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1345.605s">was</a>  the term, but it's about learning and instruction. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1350.468s">How</a>  do we want that to be able to happen in order to be able to work as a district, as a community? <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1356.871s">We</a>  wanna work together, build upon one another's strengths and provide students not only with adults, but all the way down to the classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1364.934s">I</a>  mean, right now we're on COVID time, but when we think about collaboration, pre-COVID, it was talk to your elbow partner, turn and talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1374.819s">who's</a>  your buddy, whether it was at a particular table or a group when students would go and work on, you know, in the glory days when they could get up from their desks and go work in a corner of the room and they could pick a buddy or they could be assigned to a buddy depending on what <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1393.6s">the</a>  specific task or activity was, but to promote that collaborative learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1399.683s">And</a>  that's where that collaboration came from. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1404.426s">How</a>  are we going to do all the work that we do? <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1406.707s">It</a>  may not look the same everywhere, but we want it to be done in an equitable fashion. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1413.61s">And</a>  that was where the equity came from and support. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1417.695s">How</a>  are we going to do it? <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1418.836s">At</a>  the time when we talked about fostering a safe and supportive learning environment, nobody was thinking when we said support, a safe and supportive learning environment, we were thinking about a place where children would feel welcome and you could be who you are and learn and grow and be challenged. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1439.677s">And</a>  now when we think about safe and supportive learning environment in COVID days, you have to have your mask, you have to have hand sanitizer in every single room, you've got, you know, hand pumps and you've got foot pumps. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1453.932s">It's</a>  like, <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1455.604s">You've</a>  got plastic shields. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1457.065s">Remember</a>  McLaughlin and I were just looking at classrooms at the beginning of the school year, and they were putting up plastic shields and little hooks, and kids could have a mask break and hang up their mask for a few minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1471.216s">At</a>  the time, <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1475.253s">when</a>  we were working on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1476.714s">And</a>  this last kind of version that you're looking at was from January of 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1481.616s">But</a>  we had already started the work a year plus prior to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1491.182s">But</a>  this was us taking all of the work that we had done from 2018 to 2020 <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1501.167s">try</a>  to bring it all together in one place. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1504.108s">There</a>  are a lot of initiatives within the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1507.389s">There</a>  are so many initiatives that are taking place within the schools and trying to say, as a district, we need to bring everything that's happening instructionally, social, emotionally, even from protocols and fostering and promoting a safe and supportive learning environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1529.037s">we</a>  needed to take all of that information and have it housed in one place. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1534.298s">And</a>  so that's what the strategic plan was, looking at all of the things that were happening district wide and dividing that up and saying, how are these pieces going to be executed? <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1548.842s">So</a>  from promoting the health and wellness of students, I mean, we've even said amongst ourselves, we know now that <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1558.105s">we're</a>  living in the COVID era, how many shifts do we have to make to some of the things that were already listed, which are kind of like practices that were happening, but now with COVID, <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1573.448s">What</a>  does that look like? <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1575.689s">And</a>  what does that mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1577.21s">We</a>  have circles on the floor and arrows and tape and to try to limit large groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1584.374s">So</a>  those are things where we had to figure out how are we going to adjust. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1588.816s">And</a>  so those are pieces that we want to go back to the strategic plan and infuse those additional things that had to be added in order to make <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1601.402s">in</a>  order for us to function as a district, which at the time when this was created, no one realized what was going to be happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1610.346s">So</a>  this particular strategic plan really was looking at, this was one of the requirements of NSUP, that every district should be able to take <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1627.093s">the</a>  instructional programming, the initiatives, and all of the things that you're doing within a district to be able to take it and bring it into one place. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1636.804s">And</a>  for people to be able to say, oh, this is what they're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1640.188s">So</a>  if you think about different reports that have happened over the course of the year, and based on feedback from <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1649.159s">subcommittees</a>  as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1650.541s">So</a>  under category two, collaborative relationships engage in timely, thoughtful, two-way, culturally proficient communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1660.11s">So</a>  all communications are now translated. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1664.575s">We</a>  are using different apps <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1667.337s">the</a>  talking app and different apps to help with EL families. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1671.46s">The</a>  teachers are using those. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1673.762s">Most</a>  recently, Member McLaughlin asked us to figure out how to get the closed captioning added function that we didn't have, I think, on the previous Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1688.373s">And</a>  we had to figure that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1689.434s">But</a>  now, even for this meeting, <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1691.816s">for</a>  people who need to use closed captioning, that's another way. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1698.278s">So</a>  if we were to click on this one, I don't think closed captioning was listed, but now we would need to go back and look at what does two-way communication look like and be able to say that closed captioning was added. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1718.334s">So</a>  I don't know if that it's so it is something when you you you you look at the entire district and you say well what's going on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1726.364s">Yes,</a>  the smartphone applications and and we had a new website that was deployed a year ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1734.574s">that</a>  we're continuing to tweak and refine. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1736.756s">But</a>  the new website that was deployed a year ago, the previous website, I think, hadn't been changed for probably more than 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1746.664s">So</a>  that was a huge shift where something had been in place for a long period of time, and then <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1753.93s">you</a>  know, to start off with a newer website. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1758.373s">And</a>  as we continue to get feedback and continue to say, OK, this is what's pressing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1762.855s">This</a>  should be, you know, right on the top of the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1765.597s">We</a>  are working to make those necessary adjustments in real time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1771.74s">But</a>  these were things that we were working on and saying, what did we want to be able to do to improve communications and <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1783.194s">having</a>  it housed one place so that as a leadership team, the senior leadership team, and working with all of our directors, all of our department heads, <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1797.082s">Everyone</a>  can speak the same language. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1800.604s">Everyone</a>  can refer back to it and say, oh, yes, this is engaged in timely, thoughtful, two-way, culturally proficient communication with the Medford Mustang community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1811.931s">And</a>  when this was written, and from the time that we wrote it to all of the changes and shifts that have happened just right now, <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1821.677s">The</a>  strategic plan is something that is like a living document. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1826.421s">It's</a>  not set in stone, but it lets you know these are all of the things that are happening within the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1835.149s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1837.484s">that</a>  that's kind of you know where where we are so whether member graham you're saying to you know for us to revisit and look specifically at the mission and vision and um you know update it to 2021 um we could you know <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1859.05s">definitely</a>  look at that but in terms of as a district and how we need to run and how everyone needs to be speaking the same language and realizing what are the initiatives that we're doing this is a document where administrators can use it teachers can use it so when you say we're working on x y and z it's in our strategic plan everyone's in agreement and so although right now in this format it's not for students but <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1888.252s">what</a>  students will be experiencing are outlined in detail within the strategic plan.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1895.959s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1898.842s">And</a>  I guess, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1902.278s">You</a>  know, one of the things that was so interesting about the reopening task force that we had is that when you brought all those folks together, they'll like really different takes on the same thing, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1913.663s">And</a>  so it was, it was a really valuable exercise in just sort of understanding different perspectives across the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1922.307s">And</a>  I, <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1924.208s">I</a>  know we need to sort of move on, but I don't want to not have sort of a set of action items about the strategic plan because it is really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1933.527s">Part</a>  of me is, you know, wants to have some discussion about how we engage the community in this discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1941.73s">And</a>  then I think the other thing for the school committee to consider is, you know, part of the value of the strategic plan is, as you say, like, so that all of the folks that we're asking to align to it and do work <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1957.836s">In</a>  support of it know what that work looks like and why they're doing it and where it fits. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1961.979s">But</a>  the other value of the strategic plan for the school committee in the community is to say these are our priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1968.023s">So</a>  when we start to talk about budgeting and things like if we if we want to have, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1976.189s">If</a>  the website becomes the most important thing and we're not resourced to support The changes to the website that sort of get us to the strategic plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1984.696s">That's</a>  a decision point for the committee to make In terms of like what has the community told us that they value and then how do we how do we take? <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=1993.604s">The</a>  the work that is happening, which is all in one place Match that with what the community is expecting and make sure that our budget reflects those values. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2003.412s">So</a>  I feel like <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2006.13s">We</a>  have some work to do in terms of hearing from the community about our strategic objectives and maybe it's not about. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2017.051s">asking</a>  people to respond to like the nitty gritty of this plan, because I feel like the community at large may not be positioned to tell us whether they like bullet number two, but they could probably tell us what they envision for Medford Public Schools in a broader sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2034.962s">And</a>  then, you know, there's some work to sort of connect all of that together that has to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2039.925s">So</a>  I guess when I think about the work of this committee is, <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2044.888s">you</a>  know, and I want to open it up to my colleagues is what work should we be doing this year to engage the community in this discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2053.573s">So</a>  that this is a document not only that says, like, that's a report out of what we're doing, but it is a reflection of what the community thinks that we're supposed to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2065.821s">Thoughts,</a>  questions, Melanie, Kathy? <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2073.24s">Member</a>  McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2074.821s">Sure,</a>  yeah, no, I think it's really important to be able to have some. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2080.403s">Buy</a>  in in some empowerment in the family sector to the strategic plan, so I'm not exactly sure how folks want to accomplish that, but I think it is a really important piece in terms of, you know, looking at that at what that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2098.092s">Would</a>  look like and how we can actively show families that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2102.374s">You</a>  know, <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2103.077s">their</a>  concerns and needs are incorporated in the strategic plan, both short-term and long-term. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2108.662s">And</a>  then I wanted to ask you, under the initiatives, Dr. Edouard-Vincent, it looks like those are hyperlinked, but they're not hyperlinked, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2118.81s">Or</a>  are they? <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2119.47s">Are</a>  they hyperlinked to these documents?</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2125.507s">One</a>  second, I just jumped over because you were talking about family and community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2130.309s">I</a>  wanted to, I hadn't opened that particular bullet, but this one is, I think, capturing what you're saying, family and community engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2141.595s">It's</a>  hard trying to squeeze everything in to the buckets, but this one, fostering collaborative relationships, actively ensure that all families are welcome members of the school community, <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2153.32s">who</a>  contribute to the classroom, school, and community's effectiveness. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2158.065s">So</a>  that is</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2162.282s">Can</a>  we back up just one second, Maurice? <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2164.182s">Sorry,</a>  I didn't mean to interrupt you, but that's what I wanted to ask you was that within those bullets, they're hyperlinked to these documents. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2171.124s">Is</a>  that accurate?</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2172.624s">Is</a>  that what you're- Within these bullets, all of these are hyperlinked within the document, yes.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2177.165s">Yeah,</a>  yeah, yeah, that's exactly it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2178.785s">And</a>  so that's really useful with the hyperlink, because I was looking at this last week or two weeks ago when you were sharing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2187.527s">and</a>  I noticed that they all do look like hyperlinks and being able to access the hyperlink is really helpful and then having the breakdown in these documents is really helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2195.569s">So</a>  can, is this document shared with us in a way that we can also look at the hyperlink so that we can just, I would love some time to just sort of sit with this and work with it and you know sort of link to the hyperlinks just to sort of understand the process because it's a lovely document and I think you've put a ton, clearly a ton of work into it but or and <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2217.8s">you</a>  know, the color coding and the hyperlinks and everything, it's just, I feel a little bit overwhelmed and busy with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2225.565s">So</a>  I feel like I just need to be able to wrap my mind around a little better, but please do continue with the hyperlink that you just clicked on. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2232.029s">So</a>  show me which one that you clicked on to go to the- Fostering collaborative relationships, bullet number two.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2239.214s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2239.914s">And</a>  then we had, <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2247.479s">actively</a>  ensure, engage in timely, thoughtful, two-way, culturally proficient communication, work collaboratively with community stakeholders to funnel appropriate budgetary resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2258.808s">So</a>  we really try to think about all of the components that are needed to help a district run smoothly. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2268.897s">And</a>  so this was under <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2271.888s">fostering</a>  collaborative relationships. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2273.63s">So</a>  families and staff and everyone.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2276.252s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2276.752s">And</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2277.253s">And</a>  can you do me a favor and click on the hyperlink like you were going to for number two?</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2291.902s">And</a>  remember, this was in draft phase. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2293.664s">So</a>  this is what number two, actively insuring. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2298.13s">And</a>  then one action item was review and expand transition programs to support students. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2306.06s">And</a>  it listed several outputs. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2308.823s">Elementary</a>  open house, kindergarten for kindergarten, building bridges, elementary middle school lottery open house, middle school open house, middle school barbecue orientation, high school orientation, ninth grade, high school open house for eighth graders. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2327.092s">Increased</a>  collaboration and coordination around parent education, Medford Family Network, community schools, our Board of Health, PTOs. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2336.721s">And</a>  so we had different ones listed. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2341.505s">Enhanced</a>  family engagement events. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2344.107s">curriculum</a>  night, citywide report card conferences, EL family night, PTOs. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2349.35s">So</a>  we had staff, we had parent guardians, and I had a comment for me to add hyperlink to calendars so that if someone was in the strategic plan looking at events, they could get another hyperlink that could bring them specifically to some of the calendars. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2369.759s">So</a>  this is, <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2372.296s">what</a>  we have listed right now under fostering collaborative relationships.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2380.546s">And</a>  the goal is that this would be available to the community?</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2385.921s">Yes,</a>  this would be on the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2387.742s">So</a>  once the... With hyperlinks. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2391.386s">Yes,</a>  with the hyperlinks. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2392.907s">So</a>  the community, everyone would be able to go in. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2396.05s">So</a>  this particular one, where it's fostering collaborative relationships, this would get fleshed out a little bit more. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2405.518s">And</a>  so here where we have PTOs listed, <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2410.66s">It</a>  could be either a hyperlink or the different kinds of outputs, finding ways to concretely connect, whether it's with PTOs, with the Medford Family Network, who some of the point, who would be the point person. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2427.283s">So</a>  if you were just a regular parent and not a school committee member, you could go on and say, oh, this is, you know, what's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2434.244s">And</a>  then you'd see this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2436.064s">And</a>  if we had the, whoever the, <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2440.058s">you</a>  know, elementary or high school, we could have the, you know, elementary-wide PTO rep or middle school rep, and people would be able to see who was responsible for that, for that particular task. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2455.99s">And</a>  so they'd find access and we would just connect everything, but they would be able to say, oh, this is kind of the plan that the district is on right now.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2466.312s">That's</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2467.153s">And</a>  so might I suggest that, you know, I think data is really great here too. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2471.996s">Two</a>  things, Dr. Edwin would have said that I think would be really helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2475.658s">One</a>  is I think, you know, thinking about how, you know, there is a, even a family engagement opportunity or event, or I defer to my colleagues as well on this, on how we are actively engaging families in this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2489.447s">So</a>  whether it's again, you know, longer presentation to them with feedback from them or some, <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2494.236s">import</a>  or even, I don't know, small, you know, videos of families saying things that they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2498.538s">I'm</a>  not really sure, but sort of thinking about how that's a two-way communication I think could be really helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2503.28s">And</a>  then I would also respectfully suggest that the parent education piece, you might want to include the Medford CPAC there just around the sessions that they, the monthly education sessions that they host that a lot of administrators and teachers and families go to. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2521.067s">And</a>  then <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2522.704s">Lastly,</a>  data. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2524.046s">And</a>  so I think that for me listening to a lot of the strategic plan, as I imagine it can for you, <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2534.305s">It</a>  can feel like a soft science to some degree. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2537.147s">It</a>  can feel like, you know, it's like nailing to a wall a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2540.53s">Like</a>  how is it quantifiable? <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2543.093s">As</a>  you were saying at the top, can you scroll up to the top for a second? <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2546.255s">Sorry,</a>  I have this document. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2547.476s">Yeah,</a>  the indicators of success, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2550.859s">Like</a>  what does that actually look like? <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2552.481s">So</a>  any opportunities to include <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2555.143s">data,</a>  I think, is really helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2556.864s">So</a>  whether it's, you know, two family engagement, you know, surveys a year, you know, where we're collecting data on how we're actually doing or I mean, that's just an example. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2568.71s">But</a>  I'm thinking about how are we how are we actually qualifying the two way communication, if you will. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2578.134s">So</a>  certainly, it feels like <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2579.496s">There's</a>  a lot that the district is sort of putting their arms around saying, okay, this is what our plan is for family engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2585.08s">But</a>  in order for family engagement to be effective, it's gotta be all stakeholders so that families are feeling like they're participating in this as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2595.567s">So</a>  I'm wondering how that might be achieved. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2597.649s">And</a>  again, sort of just throwing out some ideas for folks on the call and my colleagues as member Graham suggested.</p>

    <p>[Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2607.513s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2609.154s">Oh,</a>  hey, Kathy. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2609.955s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2610.335s">Yeah,</a>  I don't know why, but it keeps on putting a hand up, but I was going to chime in anyways. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2615.84s">Do</a>  you see the hand showing up, or is it just on my side? <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2620.063s">No,</a>  it's so weird. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2621.104s">There's</a>  a hand on my side. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2622.445s">It's</a>  so weird.</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2622.986s">So</a>  as a co-host, the hands don't show up.</p>

    <p>[Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2626.529s">Oh,</a>  that's right. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2627.329s">And</a>  it's a little hand, and I can move it around the screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2631.773s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2632.834s">It's</a>  never done it before. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2635.823s">But</a>  I want to chime in and just say, you know, I remember when you presented the strategic plan last year, and I remember how much time and effort all the administrative team, everybody worked collaboratively on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2651.954s">And</a>  I do think it's a great document. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2655.336s">I</a>  like the color coding. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2657.658s">You</a>  know, I was thinking as everybody was talking about how could we <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2662.928s">easily,</a>  you know, get feedback from the community without creating another task force, because that's what we don't want. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2671.294s">It</a>  just seems like everything we're doing now we're creating another task force to get feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2676.358s">Is</a>  there any way that we could, you know, maybe <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2679.82s">If</a>  we have our initial strategic plan, we could share it and then do a brief survey to ask for some feedback and just have it broken down by section. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2689.545s">I'm</a>  not sure, but I just think what I see us doing all the time is we're creating another task force and then forming another group and having another committee forum to have <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2703.173s">You</a>  know, several different communities because we want to make sure that we engage everybody in a very diverse group, you know, to hear everybody's feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2711.275s">So</a>  I just don't quite know how to go about getting the feedback, but I think that the hyperlinks are great and very easy to access and just clicking on the links and <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2723.259s">easy</a>  like dr edward marie she was updating the document while we were working on it so it seems like it's very user-friendly we could add information and edit it you know easily i just wanted to yeah yeah and i i mean i i think one of the things about being a more engaging school district is inherently that</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2747.709s">that's</a>  a choice and a value that we either have or we don't, but if we have it, it does take time to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2758.817s">And</a>  it's sort of, it's a choice that we are making to say we value the input of the community, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2767.044s">And</a>  I think, when I think back to all of the work that we did over the course of the reopening, like before the task force, we had a series of round tables <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2778.093s">And</a>  they felt, you know, I think they always feel sort of wild and crazy the first time you do something like that, but I think they went really well and they were very well attended. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2788.544s">And</a>  I think we could easily do something like that to garner the discussion that I think is really <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2797.595s">valuable</a>  in this conversation because I think it allows people to sort of share their perspective in a way that is not sort of like formed into a survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2808.679s">But</a>  I will also say that during that process, lots of people reached out to me and said, gee, I'd love to go, but I can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2816.001s">And</a>  like, why isn't there a survey for the people like me who can't attend? <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2820.143s">So</a>  I do think that from an engagement perspective, thinking about <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2828.005s">getting</a>  the buy-in of the community around what are sort of our goals, our mission, our vision. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2833.687s">I</a>  do think we should consider a series of roundtables. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2838.609s">It</a>  doesn't have to be hundreds of roundtables or anything like that, but it, you know, we probably just need to think about like <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2844.871s">Are</a>  they different by level or something? <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2846.571s">Because</a>  that was, I think, a challenge in our last set of roundtables. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2849.452s">And</a>  Zoom breakout rooms have come a really long way since the wild assignment of hundreds of people that we were doing back in the spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2859.294s">So</a>  I do think we should pursue doing something like that again. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2863.055s">I</a>  think they were <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2866.462s">I</a>  think they were meaningful and I think we learned a lot about where the community's head was at that helped inform where we wanted to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2874.627s">But</a>  I do think we should consider a survey of some kind once those are over that allows us to say, this is where we are, this is what we've heard so far, and now we wanna hear from you whether or not you were able to join us for these initial round tables. <a href="https://youtu.be/pVLpCSD7h7A&t=2893.379s">Melanie?</a> </p>
