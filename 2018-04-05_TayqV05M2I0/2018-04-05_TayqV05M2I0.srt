1
00:00:02,543 --> 00:00:09,605
[SPEAKER_11]: Meeting of the Medford School Committee will now come to order for the second round of public interviews in our superintendent search.

2
00:00:10,485 --> 00:00:13,506
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been asked by the committee just to explain a few procedures.

3
00:00:14,286 --> 00:00:18,887
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe it's the collectively we will finish our interviews tonight.

4
00:00:19,328 --> 00:00:27,350
[SPEAKER_11]: We will be meeting on Monday, and we will determine whether or not we want to proceed with site visits of the candidates that are selected.

5
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:28,810
[SPEAKER_11]: Could be all four.

6
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:29,690
[SPEAKER_11]: It could be limited.

7
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:31,831
[SPEAKER_11]: We will make that determination on Monday night.

8
00:00:33,749 --> 00:00:38,014
[SPEAKER_11]: With that, we are now going to introduce Dr. Maurice Edouard Vincent.

9
00:00:38,034 --> 00:00:46,223
[SPEAKER_02]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America.

10
00:00:56,347 --> 00:01:02,372
[SPEAKER_11]: for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

11
00:01:02,673 --> 00:01:03,693
[SPEAKER_11]: Please call the roll, Ms.

12
00:01:03,713 --> 00:01:04,034
[SPEAKER_11]: Kreatz.

13
00:01:05,175 --> 00:01:08,698
[SPEAKER_11]: I wrote down the roll.

14
00:01:09,618 --> 00:01:10,739
[SPEAKER_09]: Mrs. DiBenedetto.

15
00:01:10,819 --> 00:01:11,160
[SPEAKER_12]: Present.

16
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,301
[SPEAKER_09]: Mrs. Kreatz, here.

17
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:13,522

18
00:01:13,722 --> 00:01:13,962
[SPEAKER_12]: Here.

19
00:01:15,243 --> 00:01:15,964
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Ruggiero.

20
00:01:16,064 --> 00:01:16,364
[SPEAKER_09]: Present.

22
00:01:18,045 --> 00:01:18,306
[SPEAKER_09]: Present.

23
00:01:18,966 --> 00:01:19,987
[SPEAKER_09]: Mrs. Van de Groot.

24
00:01:20,067 --> 00:01:20,387
[SPEAKER_09]: Present.

25
00:01:20,768 --> 00:01:21,168
[SPEAKER_09]: Mayor Burke.

26
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:28,512
[SPEAKER_11]: present, seven present, none absent, if we could all rise and take a moment of silence on the 50th anniversary of the passing of Dr. Martin Luther King.

27
00:01:36,636 --> 00:01:36,916
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

28
00:02:14,856 --> 00:02:15,596
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you so much.

29
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:16,817
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome.

30
00:02:18,017 --> 00:02:19,438
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you so much for coming tonight.

31
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:23,100
[SPEAKER_11]: We'd like to give you an opportunity to make an opening statement.

32
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:30,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening school committee and members of the community.

33
00:02:30,612 --> 00:02:34,034
[SPEAKER_06]: I thank you for this opportunity to come before you this evening.

34
00:02:34,634 --> 00:02:40,396
[SPEAKER_06]: I consider it a great privilege and honor to come home to Medford, my city, my town of birth.

35
00:02:42,377 --> 00:02:43,257
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a native of Medford.

36
00:02:43,277 --> 00:02:45,758
[SPEAKER_06]: I was born in Medford at Lawrence Memorial Hospital.

37
00:02:46,758 --> 00:02:50,380
[SPEAKER_06]: I started my education here at the Hervey School.

38
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:54,882
[SPEAKER_06]: I started my kindergarten experience at the Hervey School and continued at St.

39
00:02:54,902 --> 00:02:55,682
[SPEAKER_06]: Raphael's and

40
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:57,690
[SPEAKER_06]: continued on to Arlington Catholic.

41
00:02:59,371 --> 00:03:15,739
[SPEAKER_06]: During my education here in Medford, I had an opportunity to have great mentors within the community who were strong educational representatives who really instilled and inspired me to consider education as a career path.

42
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,521
[SPEAKER_06]: I am a first generation Haitian American.

43
00:03:20,442 --> 00:03:23,083
[SPEAKER_06]: And my parents were very hardworking.

44
00:03:23,123 --> 00:03:25,384
[SPEAKER_06]: They both were custodians at Tufts University.

45
00:03:26,144 --> 00:03:38,008
[SPEAKER_06]: And they really taught us the importance of hard work, commitment, and really trying your best to improve your educational outcomes or your life outcomes.

46
00:03:38,548 --> 00:03:47,691
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think coming from that background of hard work and dedication that I went on to college, Wheelock College, and I went into the field of education.

47
00:03:48,171 --> 00:03:48,831
[SPEAKER_06]: I was a teacher.

48
00:03:49,557 --> 00:03:51,598
[SPEAKER_06]: I started as a substitute teacher, then a teacher.

49
00:03:52,378 --> 00:03:57,340
[SPEAKER_06]: I became an assistant principal, a principal, and a network superintendent.

50
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:01,041
[SPEAKER_06]: And currently I'm an instructional superintendent with Boston Public Schools.

51
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:04,302
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've been in education for 24 and a half years.

52
00:04:05,422 --> 00:04:16,486
[SPEAKER_06]: And I feel with all of my experience that when this opportunity came to apply for the superintendency of Medford, I really considered it an opportunity to come back home to Medford.

53
00:04:17,127 --> 00:04:18,387
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that brings me here.

54
00:04:18,979 --> 00:04:19,519
[SPEAKER_06]: here today.

55
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,361
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we welcome you back home.

56
00:04:22,001 --> 00:04:23,923
[SPEAKER_11]: I think tonight I'm going to start out on this side.

57
00:04:23,943 --> 00:04:25,504
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you ready, Ms.

58
00:04:25,524 --> 00:04:26,064
[SPEAKER_11]: Vander Kloot?

59
00:04:26,765 --> 00:04:27,045
OK.

60
00:04:27,105 --> 00:04:28,286
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.

61
00:04:30,487 --> 00:04:36,051
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it would be helpful if we understood a little bit more about your current job capacity.

62
00:04:36,712 --> 00:04:39,574
[SPEAKER_07]: Boston is a little bit unknown to us.

63
00:04:40,574 --> 00:04:48,540
[SPEAKER_07]: And so if you could explain exactly what you do in your current position, that would be extremely helpful.

64
00:04:48,899 --> 00:04:50,500
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

65
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,842
[SPEAKER_06]: So in my current role right now, I am an instructional superintendent.

66
00:04:55,443 --> 00:04:57,624
[SPEAKER_06]: I am over a teaching and learning team.

67
00:04:58,384 --> 00:05:00,485
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's TLT 1A.

68
00:05:01,146 --> 00:05:05,628
[SPEAKER_06]: So the combined teaching and learning team consists of 30 schools.

69
00:05:06,528 --> 00:05:09,550
[SPEAKER_06]: And I am responsible for half of that.

70
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:11,611
[SPEAKER_06]: The focus is K-8 schools.

71
00:05:12,652 --> 00:05:18,495
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have dual language, early childhood schools, elementary K-5 schools,

72
00:05:20,181 --> 00:05:23,223
[SPEAKER_06]: K-6, 6-8, K-8.

73
00:05:23,543 --> 00:05:28,465
[SPEAKER_06]: So there are multiple configurations of the schools that I work with.

74
00:05:28,966 --> 00:05:32,027
[SPEAKER_06]: And from an instructional perspective, I support the schools.

75
00:05:32,627 --> 00:05:35,549
[SPEAKER_06]: So every school is required to have an instructional focus.

76
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:39,070
[SPEAKER_06]: And we conduct instructional focus reviews.

77
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:41,811
[SPEAKER_06]: So I support the principals instructionally.

78
00:05:41,831 --> 00:05:43,292
[SPEAKER_06]: I supervise them.

79
00:05:43,312 --> 00:05:45,173
[SPEAKER_06]: I do their evaluations.

80
00:05:45,916 --> 00:06:00,285
[SPEAKER_06]: I support principals if they have any challenges, if they need support for professional development, if there are concerns from families, I will support the schools in that regard.

81
00:06:00,345 --> 00:06:05,909
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would be the first point of contact on an instructional level for schools.

82
00:06:07,419 --> 00:06:20,902
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm not sure if- When you say instructional focus, are you meaning instruction curriculum overall, or are you, is there different instructional methods that differentiate the schools?

83
00:06:21,502 --> 00:06:32,244
[SPEAKER_06]: So some schools do have different instructional methods that they're using, but based on their data, each school designs or creates an instructional focus.

84
00:06:32,784 --> 00:06:34,065
[SPEAKER_06]: So for some schools,

85
00:06:35,546 --> 00:06:44,688
[SPEAKER_06]: depending on the constituencies that are there based on the results of data, they may say that they're going to focus on increasing rigor.

86
00:06:45,669 --> 00:06:47,449
[SPEAKER_06]: They may be looking at productive struggle.

87
00:06:47,989 --> 00:06:54,871
[SPEAKER_06]: Some schools may have a focus on discourse, student-to-student discourse, teacher-to-student discourse.

88
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:56,451
[SPEAKER_06]: So they would look at data.

89
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,492
[SPEAKER_06]: Some schools are focusing on writing.

90
00:06:58,908 --> 00:07:05,910
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's individualized to the needs of each respective school, but the focus has to be based on data.

91
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:12,511
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not that they just feel like, you know, we're gonna look at student discourse, but there's a reason why.

92
00:07:12,591 --> 00:07:26,714
[SPEAKER_06]: So if they maybe have a high English language learner population, and they want the students to use more academic vocabulary, or the students are still learning how to produce language, then that school could potentially have an instructional focus

93
00:07:27,259 --> 00:07:37,566
[SPEAKER_06]: that deals with discourse and developing discourse and looking at the ratio of student-to-student talk versus teacher-to-student talk.

94
00:07:38,206 --> 00:07:50,033
[SPEAKER_06]: And so when we conduct instructional focus reviews, it's a cross-functional team that goes into the schools and we go into multiple classrooms and we look for evidence of the instructional focus.

95
00:07:50,994 --> 00:07:55,617
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we either see the instructional focus being implemented or we don't see it.

96
00:07:56,164 --> 00:08:01,168
[SPEAKER_06]: And at the end of the instructional focus review, we give feedback to the school.

97
00:08:01,709 --> 00:08:08,415
[SPEAKER_06]: And by giving the school feedback, we can say we saw evidence of your instructional focus, maybe in three out of four areas.

98
00:08:08,915 --> 00:08:17,583
[SPEAKER_06]: And we can be as granular as based on these number of classrooms, this is where we saw evidence, this is where we did not see evidence.

99
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:23,708
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the schools take that information and they work with their instructional leadership teams to address

100
00:08:25,207 --> 00:08:26,247
[SPEAKER_06]: their instructional focus.

101
00:08:26,928 --> 00:08:31,949
[SPEAKER_07]: So tell me about one of the biggest challenges in working in your current position.

102
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:51,494
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would say one of the challenges that principals sometimes face when we're looking at the instructional realm is if something were to potentially happen operationally or if something were to happen such as, you know, they're going into

103
00:08:52,492 --> 00:08:59,594
[SPEAKER_06]: conduct a common planning time meeting, but they may be called out to go address a disciplinary challenge.

104
00:09:00,855 --> 00:09:03,135
[SPEAKER_06]: Or they may need to meet with a parent.

105
00:09:03,475 --> 00:09:12,958
[SPEAKER_06]: So sometimes principals will say that there was a conflict and they were pulled away from working on that particular challenge.

106
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:21,561
[SPEAKER_06]: Another challenge as well sometimes is based on the curriculum or the programming that is at a particular school.

107
00:09:22,176 --> 00:09:28,081
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes they may need or would like to have more resources, but there are limited resources.

108
00:09:28,461 --> 00:09:32,805
[SPEAKER_06]: So sometimes that's a challenge that they say, I would like to have more of something.

109
00:09:32,985 --> 00:09:34,106
[SPEAKER_07]: But what is your challenge?

110
00:09:34,846 --> 00:09:42,492
[SPEAKER_06]: So my challenge working with the schools right now is sometimes just balancing the sheer number.

111
00:09:43,013 --> 00:09:49,658
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's no way that I could possibly get to every school every single week.

112
00:09:50,137 --> 00:09:57,378
[SPEAKER_06]: So sometimes a challenge would be trying to manage if I'm going to be on a two-week cycle or a three-week cycle with the school.

113
00:09:57,878 --> 00:10:05,400
[SPEAKER_06]: So depending on the level of the work that I'm doing at the school, I may be able to go to two to three schools a day.

114
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:18,402
[SPEAKER_06]: So if they have an instructional leadership team meeting before school, then I could start there and then go to two schools and possibly support them during common planning time meeting or planning or doing observational rounds.

115
00:10:19,818 --> 00:10:28,487
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my own personal challenge, is trying to get to more schools and be value add.

116
00:10:28,807 --> 00:10:34,353
[SPEAKER_06]: So not just go through as a drive-by, but go through to actually support the instruction that's happening.

117
00:10:34,693 --> 00:10:34,913
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

118
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:35,434
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

119
00:10:36,755 --> 00:10:37,376
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

120
00:10:37,957 --> 00:10:38,577
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Russo.

121
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:40,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello again.

122
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:47,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, with all these schools, I'm sure, I'm hoping you can have an answer to this question.

123
00:10:47,767 --> 00:10:52,436
[SPEAKER_04]: What is a popular educational initiative or practice of which you're skeptical and why?

124
00:10:54,139 --> 00:10:55,361
[SPEAKER_06]: Of which I'm skeptical.

125
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:19,012
[SPEAKER_06]: A skeptical practice.

126
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:27,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, actually, one that's popular, but for which that doesn't make it necessarily a good idea.

127
00:11:27,617 --> 00:11:33,781
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm sure that answering this is uncomfortable.

128
00:11:33,821 --> 00:11:34,381
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the point.

129
00:11:38,163 --> 00:11:41,025
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to just think through my portfolio of schools.

130
00:11:49,201 --> 00:12:05,453
[SPEAKER_06]: and I want to answer the question, but I would say, um, I have some skepticism with, I was thinking about how some of our sciences are being implemented.

131
00:12:05,473 --> 00:12:18,142
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and my skeptic, not with the content of science, but more skepticism with the frequency of implementation, um, that,

132
00:12:19,289 --> 00:12:22,971
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're not able, like that's one of the things that in my own mind I'm thinking about.

133
00:12:22,991 --> 00:12:35,098
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're not able to dedicate enough time to the instruction of science, I'm skeptical that I'm going to see outcomes move significantly.

134
00:12:36,058 --> 00:12:47,124
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is something where I feel that we are struggling because science is an area that has been grossly neglected.

135
00:12:48,543 --> 00:13:01,155
[SPEAKER_06]: as a district and even within the TLT, within the teaching and learning team, that it's an area where people struggle to find time to fully implement it.

136
00:13:01,695 --> 00:13:10,964
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm skeptical about if we're not able to create the time without robbing Peter to pay Paul, taking away from history, taking away from social studies.

137
00:13:12,305 --> 00:13:14,687
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like they feel it's almost like

138
00:13:15,117 --> 00:13:19,398
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to implement one or I implement the other, but it can never be implemented well.

139
00:13:20,238 --> 00:13:27,960
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm skeptical about seeing the needle actually move if we're not able to come up with a real solution.

140
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:31,501
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope I answered your question.

141
00:13:33,401 --> 00:13:38,643
[SPEAKER_11]: Could you describe your management style and how you feel you collaborate with key stakeholders?

142
00:13:41,143 --> 00:13:44,024
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel that I am a distributive leader.

143
00:13:44,844 --> 00:13:47,225
[SPEAKER_06]: My management style is one where I'm collaborative.

144
00:13:47,685 --> 00:13:50,026
[SPEAKER_06]: I work very well in teams.

145
00:13:51,186 --> 00:13:56,808
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe in delegating and building and working with the team's strengths.

146
00:13:57,969 --> 00:14:03,130
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't believe that I'm the keeper of all the knowledge.

147
00:14:04,131 --> 00:14:13,454
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe that everyone who's part of the team or working with me has something valuable to contribute, and through their contributions, we can be the most effective team.

148
00:14:14,867 --> 00:14:20,871
[SPEAKER_11]: So if we were to consider the superintendent the number one of the school system, what type of person would be your number two?

149
00:14:23,372 --> 00:14:30,436
[SPEAKER_06]: A number two person who would be working with me would have, I feel, a complementary skill set.

150
00:14:30,877 --> 00:14:38,221
[SPEAKER_06]: So I am, you know, I feel I'm a creative, a creative thinker.

151
00:14:40,042 --> 00:14:41,143
[SPEAKER_06]: I think very quickly.

152
00:14:41,163 --> 00:14:42,104
[SPEAKER_06]: I move very quickly.

153
00:14:42,184 --> 00:14:44,425
[SPEAKER_06]: So if I had someone who had a complementary

154
00:14:44,938 --> 00:14:47,500
[SPEAKER_06]: skill set that they also, too, would be able to move quickly.

155
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:58,987
[SPEAKER_06]: But one thing that I would not do specifically would be, like, I am not one to necessarily go into graphs and always do a punch list.

156
00:14:59,407 --> 00:15:09,293
[SPEAKER_06]: So I feel that having someone with a complementary skill set would be someone who would work well with having a punch list and saying, okay, these are all the things we said that we were going to do.

157
00:15:09,794 --> 00:15:13,136
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's just cross-reference to see if we've accomplished those things.

158
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:16,214
[SPEAKER_11]: So would you be part of the follow-up on the punch list?

159
00:15:16,895 --> 00:15:17,995
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, always.

160
00:15:18,136 --> 00:15:23,200
[SPEAKER_06]: I would go back to follow-up to make sure that we get to the end goal.

161
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,961
[SPEAKER_06]: By style, I'm not a micromanager.

162
00:15:24,981 --> 00:15:32,727
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe in delegating, trusting that everyone who's part of the team has the skill set and the ability to do what they're being asked.

163
00:15:33,348 --> 00:15:43,416
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would also focus on creating the conditions where there was definitely relational trust, so that if you encounter difficulty, you would be able to say, I'm stuck, I need help,

164
00:15:43,953 --> 00:15:45,294
[SPEAKER_06]: that the person would communicate that.

165
00:15:45,354 --> 00:15:58,119
[SPEAKER_06]: So when it came time to report back on where we were with this particular product or what we were trying to meet, that I would be able to then say, OK, let's see how we can strategize.

166
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:03,682
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see if we can bring in an additional voice to help get to the deadline.

167
00:16:04,502 --> 00:16:04,862
[SPEAKER_11]: Very good.

168
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:05,283
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

169
00:16:05,743 --> 00:16:05,903
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

170
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:06,223
[SPEAKER_11]: Mostong.

171
00:16:12,085 --> 00:16:13,145
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is two parts.

172
00:16:13,366 --> 00:16:22,009
[SPEAKER_08]: One is, what do you think is the primary function of a superintendent nowadays with so many shifting educational requirements?

173
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:28,532
[SPEAKER_08]: And how would you implement your first steps for this priority if you were to be our superintendent?

174
00:16:30,473 --> 00:16:39,897
[SPEAKER_06]: So as superintendent, the primary function would be to ensure that all schools are fully functioning, that you have an instructional leader in every building,

175
00:16:40,518 --> 00:17:02,408
[SPEAKER_06]: that every building has teachers and staff just to be in compliance from a central office level to make sure that you have all central office representatives there so that the central office function of the school connecting to the mayor's office and the other city departments, that there's communication going back and forth between all of those departments.

176
00:17:02,748 --> 00:17:09,831
[SPEAKER_06]: So the superintendent has to be the one who's managing what's happening at the schools and managing

177
00:17:10,365 --> 00:17:25,294
[SPEAKER_06]: what's happening at Central in regards to, and communicating with the mayor's office and realizing that we're not an entity unto ourselves, but that we have other parts of the city that work in collaboration with us.

178
00:17:25,894 --> 00:17:37,921
[SPEAKER_06]: So I feel that that would be the primary role, and ensuring, again, whoever the team of instructional leaders are that are at the schools, that they have access to me as the superintendent

179
00:17:39,638 --> 00:17:43,021
[SPEAKER_06]: come voice concerns, say, you know, come celebrate.

180
00:17:43,841 --> 00:17:46,223
[SPEAKER_06]: These are bright spots that we have happening in our schools.

181
00:17:46,743 --> 00:17:54,529
[SPEAKER_06]: So to have that open communication line to ensure that the students are being educated at the highest levels.

182
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:57,351
[SPEAKER_06]: And you said the second part.

183
00:17:57,511 --> 00:17:58,112
[SPEAKER_08]: First steps.

184
00:17:58,212 --> 00:18:02,715
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you were to be superintendent, what do you think your first steps would be in the new role?

185
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:15,778
[SPEAKER_06]: So if I was chosen to be the superintendent as part of my entry, my first step would have to be to listen and listen with both ears.

186
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,501
[SPEAKER_06]: I would need to listen.

187
00:18:18,621 --> 00:18:22,706
[SPEAKER_06]: I would need to have an opportunity to learn what is the context of

188
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:36,594
[SPEAKER_06]: Medford right now, what's happening in Medford, and once I gather that information, once I listen, I learn, and I would be learning not only from the schools, but from other stakeholders, from parents, from community partners.

189
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:59,189
[SPEAKER_06]: Once I gather that information and I'm able to really look more closely at all the data that is available, then I would be better poised to make a decision to say, okay, based on what I've listened to and heard, based on what the stakeholders have shared with me, based on all of that data, this is how I would like to move forward and lead.

190
00:18:59,549 --> 00:19:06,194
[SPEAKER_06]: So I feel like as a superintendent, I cannot just come and jump and say, this is what I'm going to do.

191
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:15,937
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to know what's happening, what is working, what we have room to maybe make some slight shifts, and then move forward from there.

192
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:17,178
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

193
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:18,860
[SPEAKER_09]: You're welcome.

194
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,160
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

195
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:19,220
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

196
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:19,340
[SPEAKER_09]: Kress.

197
00:19:19,941 --> 00:19:20,241
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello.

198
00:19:20,321 --> 00:19:21,061
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, Dr. Vincent.

199
00:19:21,882 --> 00:19:22,202
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi.

200
00:19:22,423 --> 00:19:22,583
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

201
00:19:22,923 --> 00:19:27,727
[SPEAKER_09]: So I have this one question has three parts, if you want to write it down.

202
00:19:27,747 --> 00:19:28,527
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

203
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:31,069
[SPEAKER_09]: I know the other night it was a long question, so they wrote it down.

204
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:33,051
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'll read it slowly.

205
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:39,691
[SPEAKER_09]: So as you know, Medford Public Schools has 18 approved vocational CTE programs.

206
00:19:44,772 --> 00:19:48,573
[SPEAKER_09]: How would you enhance the programs already in place?

207
00:19:50,154 --> 00:19:53,574
[SPEAKER_09]: What is needed to remain on the cutting edge of technology?

208
00:19:57,295 --> 00:20:00,536
[SPEAKER_09]: Where do you see the programs in three to five years?

209
00:20:10,768 --> 00:20:12,430
[SPEAKER_06]: I can repeat if you need me to for anything.

210
00:20:13,331 --> 00:20:21,819
[SPEAKER_06]: First and foremost, I want to say that I know the merger between the general high school and the vocational side of the high school.

211
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:31,348
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a great idea that the schools have merged, but I also know that there was some

212
00:20:33,257 --> 00:20:39,384
[SPEAKER_06]: For some people, there were some pain points because you felt like you were giving up something in the merging of the two schools.

213
00:20:40,265 --> 00:20:43,088
[SPEAKER_06]: But in the end, you end up making a stronger district.

214
00:20:44,649 --> 00:20:54,220
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now, with CTE programming, and I will also call it project-based learning, when you look at

215
00:20:56,243 --> 00:21:02,648
[SPEAKER_06]: the programming that is in place and how the school district can advance in three to five years.

216
00:21:03,969 --> 00:21:21,524
[SPEAKER_06]: If we are able to fine tune and have master students that at the end of their time at Medford High School, that they would be able to, one, be employed and or for career and or college path, leave with official certifications,

217
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:24,934
[SPEAKER_06]: that will allow them to be job ready.

218
00:21:24,954 --> 00:21:34,426
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel that that is what needs to happen and to look at the pathway of also adding college level courses.

219
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:50,305
[SPEAKER_06]: at the high school level as an extension so that students who are graduating, depending on their levels and abilities, they would be able to be graduating with college credits.

220
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:59,552
[SPEAKER_06]: So it does require strict implementation of the Mass Corps, making sure that they get all the official basics.

221
00:22:00,092 --> 00:22:03,595
[SPEAKER_06]: And then with their specialty classes,

222
00:22:05,037 --> 00:22:11,862
[SPEAKER_06]: where they can continue to have placements, internship placements, but to build upon that and add the college partnerships.

223
00:22:13,363 --> 00:22:16,125
[SPEAKER_06]: Bunker Hill, I know Tufts is nearby.

224
00:22:17,746 --> 00:22:28,853
[SPEAKER_06]: We possibly, I'm just thinking about schools that you could tap into in the three to five year range to go with that specific pathway where students would be finishing high school.

225
00:22:29,429 --> 00:22:30,690
[SPEAKER_06]: with college credits.

226
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:47,738
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel that that would be the next iteration or the next level of CTE so that, yes, they are college and career ready, and some students have already achieved college credits at the high school level, and it can be done.

227
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:58,003
[SPEAKER_06]: In terms of technology, technology is a must in terms of where we are moving in order to be competitive with the rest of the world.

228
00:22:59,847 --> 00:23:15,554
[SPEAKER_06]: Technology, it's important to have, but if you put technology in the hands of the students, you have to make sure that as they're using the technology, that appropriate professional development and training has also happened for the teachers.

229
00:23:16,174 --> 00:23:24,598
[SPEAKER_06]: And so in one of my schools that was on my portfolio received one-to-one iPads.

230
00:23:25,788 --> 00:23:26,650
[SPEAKER_06]: for all the students.

231
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:33,883
[SPEAKER_06]: The students, as we know, are using their phones, are using technology all the time to really advance the work that they're doing.

232
00:23:36,391 --> 00:23:41,094
[SPEAKER_06]: students have grass technology at a faster rate than some of the teachers.

233
00:23:41,774 --> 00:23:54,262
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I think in order to use technology, it should be used, it should be integrated, but it should not just be an add-on, such as type up your notes in a Google Doc and send your notes to me.

234
00:23:54,623 --> 00:24:04,609
[SPEAKER_06]: But really having students doing research, embedding links, doing presentations, really taking technology to a level where they're able to

235
00:24:05,836 --> 00:24:16,885
[SPEAKER_06]: present portfolios to display their work that they've had for over the course of the year or in increments, incremental sessions over the year.

236
00:24:18,526 --> 00:24:19,327
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

237
00:24:20,588 --> 00:24:21,328
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. Benedetto.

238
00:24:21,348 --> 00:24:21,909
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi.

239
00:24:22,309 --> 00:24:24,010
[SPEAKER_12]: Nice to meet you.

240
00:24:24,511 --> 00:24:24,871
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

241
00:24:25,611 --> 00:24:28,354
[SPEAKER_12]: My first question is pretty specific.

242
00:24:29,615 --> 00:24:31,156
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sure you looked at some of our data.

243
00:24:32,166 --> 00:24:39,269
[SPEAKER_12]: And what is your plan to increase the academic growth at each level of our educational system?

244
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:41,551
[SPEAKER_12]: So our elementary, middle, and high school.

245
00:24:44,292 --> 00:24:46,593
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're saying to improve academic data?

246
00:24:46,773 --> 00:24:47,053
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

247
00:24:47,373 --> 00:24:50,595
[SPEAKER_12]: To increase academic scores or rigor in any way.

248
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:59,519
[SPEAKER_12]: Like if you saw by looking at our data areas that you felt that needed growth and attention at this point, and what kind of ideas do you have to help us?

249
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:05,242
[SPEAKER_12]: I saw in your resume that you were able to bring schools up to level one.

250
00:25:05,803 --> 00:25:15,107
[SPEAKER_12]: And just the type of things, based on our data, if you had a chance to look at that, if you had any specific ideas or examples.

251
00:25:15,768 --> 00:25:21,374
[SPEAKER_06]: So I did spend quite a bit of time looking at your state data on the DESE site.

252
00:25:21,774 --> 00:25:27,400
[SPEAKER_06]: And if I could start with some of the bright spots that I had noted.

253
00:25:28,261 --> 00:25:30,643
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I can go into what some of my wonderings were.

254
00:25:30,663 --> 00:25:34,948
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I can share that with the team.

255
00:25:34,988 --> 00:25:38,011
[SPEAKER_06]: So bright spots, I started with the high school.

256
00:25:40,367 --> 00:25:53,037
[SPEAKER_06]: that 91% of your students were proficient or higher on the grade 10 ELA with student growth percentile of 70, which is outstanding.

257
00:25:53,057 --> 00:25:55,519
[SPEAKER_06]: 40 to 60 is the range.

258
00:25:56,259 --> 00:25:57,560
[SPEAKER_06]: 51 is what you're looking for.

259
00:25:58,341 --> 00:26:01,504
[SPEAKER_06]: And high school ELA SGP is 70.

260
00:26:01,964 --> 00:26:04,046
[SPEAKER_06]: The SGP is a student growth percentile.

261
00:26:04,166 --> 00:26:09,650
[SPEAKER_06]: And what it is is taking a student from one year, that cohort, and measuring

262
00:26:10,066 --> 00:26:16,268
[SPEAKER_06]: that same student a year later with other students who performed at the same level as that child.

263
00:26:16,648 --> 00:26:18,969
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not across the entire state.

264
00:26:19,349 --> 00:26:23,550
[SPEAKER_06]: So sometimes when you look at SGP, people may say, oh, it's Medford Public Schools.

265
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:27,411
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's across the entire state of Massachusetts.

266
00:26:27,751 --> 00:26:33,513
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's something, a tremendous bright spot and something to applaud.

267
00:26:33,973 --> 00:26:35,274
[SPEAKER_06]: At grade 10 math, 77% of your students

268
00:26:37,361 --> 00:26:39,663
[SPEAKER_06]: scored at proficient or higher with the SGP of 61.

269
00:26:40,303 --> 00:26:49,029
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, the range being 40 to 60, that's where the state designates it as the regular expected growth.

270
00:26:49,089 --> 00:26:50,470
[SPEAKER_06]: So 61 is above that.

271
00:26:53,011 --> 00:27:00,196
[SPEAKER_06]: I looked also at your grade 10 ELA, where students scored a two or higher.

272
00:27:00,756 --> 00:27:03,098
[SPEAKER_06]: And you had 85% of your students, of the 344 students,

273
00:27:06,952 --> 00:27:13,817
[SPEAKER_06]: scoring and at the state, at that particular number, the state was at 86%, so you were neck and neck with the state.

274
00:27:15,418 --> 00:27:24,324
[SPEAKER_06]: For your AP test scores, students scoring a 3 or higher, you were at 84.5, whereas the state was only at 65.7.

275
00:27:25,364 --> 00:27:28,907
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's really something to applaud your AP teachers.

276
00:27:29,372 --> 00:27:30,453
[SPEAKER_06]: and what's happening there.

277
00:27:31,713 --> 00:27:35,195
[SPEAKER_06]: And so with our Mass Corps in 2017, you had 100% versus the state at 77.4%.

278
00:27:35,235 --> 00:27:38,457
[SPEAKER_06]: And so you also did well with attendance at 94.4% student absence.

279
00:27:38,477 --> 00:27:39,337
[SPEAKER_06]: Your days were, although

280
00:27:49,611 --> 00:27:52,212
[SPEAKER_06]: Attendance and absences is something we want to work with.

281
00:27:52,872 --> 00:27:54,853
[SPEAKER_06]: Average student absences were nine days.

282
00:27:54,913 --> 00:27:59,234
[SPEAKER_06]: The state was at 9.5 for Medford and 11.6 for the state.

283
00:28:00,755 --> 00:28:03,756
[SPEAKER_06]: Your in-school suspensions were lower than the state at zero.

284
00:28:04,256 --> 00:28:05,957
[SPEAKER_06]: Your out-of-school suspensions were 5.3.

285
00:28:05,997 --> 00:28:07,177
[SPEAKER_06]: The state was at 4.2, but still

286
00:28:09,638 --> 00:28:10,979
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a very respectable number.

287
00:28:12,379 --> 00:28:18,562
[SPEAKER_06]: So those were some of the areas that had really jumped out at me as tremendous bright spots to be proud of as a district.

288
00:28:20,003 --> 00:28:31,648
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the areas where I had wonderings was on the open response in high schools, where we did have a tour above.

289
00:28:34,089 --> 00:28:36,350
[SPEAKER_06]: I was wondering about that, I was wondering about

290
00:28:37,891 --> 00:28:44,944
[SPEAKER_06]: Introductory physics of the 211 students who were taking that test and there was like a 47%

291
00:28:49,420 --> 00:29:04,424
[SPEAKER_06]: I looked at all of our students and looked at, for all students, reading, writing, and math, and noticed that for special ed students, that that was one of the areas where we had a wider gap.

292
00:29:05,484 --> 00:29:10,025
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I also wonder about our English language learners.

293
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:21,313
[SPEAKER_06]: and how our English language learners are, they're not graduating at the same rate as your gen ed students.

294
00:29:21,933 --> 00:29:33,322
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's almost like one out of every two, or 50%, 55% graduation rate, so that was something that kind of had me wondering.

295
00:29:33,402 --> 00:29:38,486
[SPEAKER_06]: So at the elementary levels, we have,

296
00:29:39,821 --> 00:29:41,982
[SPEAKER_06]: several level two schools.

297
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:47,105
[SPEAKER_06]: As a district, we are a solid level two district.

298
00:29:47,425 --> 00:29:52,527
[SPEAKER_06]: In 2015, that was the only year where there was a dip down to a level three for one year.

299
00:29:53,108 --> 00:29:55,489
[SPEAKER_06]: But from 2012, 2013, 2014, 2016, we brought it back up and became a level two district.

300
00:30:02,987 --> 00:30:10,512
[SPEAKER_06]: 2017, the district has no official level until the state gives the official new designations.

301
00:30:11,172 --> 00:30:29,184
[SPEAKER_06]: So as I think about the elementary levels where I know, when I think about English language learners and I think about students with disabilities, if we do not have a strong foundation, then you're not going to be able to stand tall and stand proud.

302
00:30:29,713 --> 00:30:42,020
[SPEAKER_06]: So as I applaud the high school ELA scores and the math scores, I feel that something solid and strong is happening in terms of English instruction at the upper grades.

303
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:53,307
[SPEAKER_06]: However, when they get to middle school, I am wondering what is happening with our students with disabilities and our English language learners, and specifically

304
00:30:54,196 --> 00:30:57,760
[SPEAKER_06]: what instructional strategies are being used for those students.

305
00:30:58,301 --> 00:31:12,957
[SPEAKER_06]: So when I was leading a school and we realized that we needed to have a sheltered English immersion program, an SCI program for our English language learners, we drastically changed how we were teaching.

306
00:31:13,951 --> 00:31:23,981
[SPEAKER_06]: So I believe in having a growth mindset and not looking at English language learners or students with disabilities from a deficit perspective.

307
00:31:24,601 --> 00:31:30,487
[SPEAKER_06]: And so look at their ability, English language learners, to speak more than one language.

308
00:31:30,527 --> 00:31:32,348
[SPEAKER_06]: Myself, I can speak another language.

309
00:31:32,729 --> 00:31:36,873
[SPEAKER_06]: They're actually using more parts of the brain to be able to communicate.

310
00:31:37,433 --> 00:31:42,675
[SPEAKER_06]: in two different languages, and sometimes to even be able to read and write in another language.

311
00:31:43,195 --> 00:31:49,238
[SPEAKER_06]: But as you're acquiring English, there is a silent phase that is five to seven years.

312
00:31:49,978 --> 00:32:02,223
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're getting English language learners at the elementary levels, coming in at first, second, third grade, you have to give them five to seven years before they are actually English dominant.

313
00:32:02,523 --> 00:32:05,404
[SPEAKER_06]: So that brings you to the end of middle school.

314
00:32:06,104 --> 00:32:19,235
[SPEAKER_06]: And so when you get to the end of middle school, going into high school, that's when you're able to see a lot of students that were Ls, they end up flapping, and you end up saying, wow, they're actually performing on par.

315
00:32:19,895 --> 00:32:27,381
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's that silent phase where, like sponges, they are taking in the other language and processing it.

316
00:32:28,022 --> 00:32:32,986
[SPEAKER_06]: Students who speak another language, they originally pick up social English very quickly.

317
00:32:33,302 --> 00:32:35,123
[SPEAKER_06]: but they don't pick up the academic language.

318
00:32:35,623 --> 00:32:41,886
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's the academic language that is inside all of the content, all of the books, everything that's being taught.

319
00:32:42,426 --> 00:32:49,809
[SPEAKER_06]: So those are some of the strategies that I would recommend using at the elementary levels, using cognates.

320
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:54,972
[SPEAKER_06]: Clustering languages could be a possibility depending on what the languages are.

321
00:32:55,592 --> 00:32:59,814
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you use some of the Romance languages, whether it could be French or Spanish,

322
00:33:00,405 --> 00:33:16,428
[SPEAKER_06]: or Portuguese or Italian, taking some languages that have similar bases, clustering them and teaching them so that when you're using a specific word in English that has a cognate in their native language, they're able to make the connection very quickly.

323
00:33:17,189 --> 00:33:27,971
[SPEAKER_06]: And so by doing that, when you chunk the information, you build background knowledge, those were some of the things that I did working with large populations of students that were ELLs.

324
00:33:28,612 --> 00:33:31,918
[SPEAKER_06]: For students with disabilities, that same strategy works.

325
00:33:32,219 --> 00:33:36,287
[SPEAKER_06]: The best practices that work for students with disabilities also work for ELLs.

326
00:33:36,866 --> 00:33:41,088
[SPEAKER_06]: increasing visuals, using non-traditional methods of instruction.

327
00:33:41,408 --> 00:33:45,489
[SPEAKER_06]: So do not talk at the children all day in lecture style.

328
00:33:45,809 --> 00:33:46,790
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not gonna work.

329
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:49,511
[SPEAKER_06]: Give them opportunities to listen.

330
00:33:50,671 --> 00:33:54,072
[SPEAKER_06]: Books on tape, let them listen auditorily.

331
00:33:54,793 --> 00:33:56,613
[SPEAKER_06]: Let them have opportunities to speak.

332
00:33:57,093 --> 00:34:01,455
[SPEAKER_06]: Let them have opportunities to practice the language, make mistakes with the language.

333
00:34:01,815 --> 00:34:03,896
[SPEAKER_06]: Give them opportunities to turn and talk.

334
00:34:04,722 --> 00:34:10,006
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, that gives them that opportunity to build the discourse and become stronger students.

335
00:34:10,687 --> 00:34:33,384
[SPEAKER_06]: So I feel like if there's a stronger base at the elementary level, when they get to middle school and you're teaching specific by-content areas, the children are older, they're more mature, they're able to take on more responsibility, so that by the time they are at high school, they are young adults, they are able to kind of spread their wings and really fly and succeed.

336
00:34:34,994 --> 00:34:37,497
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, that's an excellent answer to my question.

337
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:40,401
[SPEAKER_12]: You know your stuff.

338
00:34:42,724 --> 00:34:43,525
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening, Doctor.

339
00:34:45,567 --> 00:34:50,393
[SPEAKER_03]: You started as the instructional superintendent in Boston Public Schools in 2015, is that correct?

340
00:34:51,174 --> 00:34:51,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

341
00:34:53,157 --> 00:35:00,900
[SPEAKER_06]: 2015, I started actually as a network superintendent, and so under that structure, it was a slightly different structure.

342
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:17,186
[SPEAKER_06]: At that time, as a network superintendent, I was responsible for both instructional and operational needs of a building, so I was the point person for both sides of the house, and I would report directly to the superintendent.

343
00:35:17,586 --> 00:35:20,987
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, as an instructional superintendent, I have a counterpart,

344
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:25,143
[SPEAKER_06]: who is operational superintendent, and the two of us work collaboratively.

345
00:35:25,303 --> 00:35:25,503
[SPEAKER_06]: I see.

346
00:35:25,803 --> 00:35:27,024
[SPEAKER_03]: I see.

347
00:35:27,164 --> 00:35:34,029
[SPEAKER_03]: So while I was researching the Boston public school system, I came across a surprising trend that was talked about in Boston Magazine.

348
00:35:36,071 --> 00:35:42,555
[SPEAKER_03]: When you started in 2015, Boston Magazine stated that your district spent about $17,000, $17,500 per pupil, and it ranked your district 116 out of 125 area schools.

349
00:35:51,355 --> 00:36:04,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Despite spending about $2,000 more per pupil since 2015, the ranking over your tenure actually slipped, and now some educational experts rank the Boston Public Schools among the five lower ones.

350
00:36:05,579 --> 00:36:15,182
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted you to comment on that, and I was wondering, what do you think that Boston Magazine might have missed over the couple of years that you've been working in the Boston Public School system?

351
00:36:17,748 --> 00:36:30,914
[SPEAKER_06]: To answer that question, when I think about the outcomes of the students going down, I would have to really attribute it to there's a lot of trauma in Boston.

352
00:36:31,834 --> 00:36:47,261
[SPEAKER_06]: And I have to say, honestly, social emotional learning, there's a body of research and a lot of people are realizing right now that social emotional learning does impact how students perform.

353
00:36:47,853 --> 00:37:12,364
[SPEAKER_06]: And I do feel, being a large urban district, that the amount of trauma that many students face and encounter between shootings near schools, shootings when students are at recess, violence on the streets, that that does have an impact in terms of when it gets to the schools.

354
00:37:12,845 --> 00:37:15,406
[SPEAKER_06]: And so some schools where outcomes have

355
00:37:16,204 --> 00:37:18,266
[SPEAKER_06]: actually dropped.

356
00:37:18,807 --> 00:37:29,718
[SPEAKER_06]: If you were to speak to principals, the instructional leaders of the schools, they would say there has been a significant increase in the amount of trauma that they're experiencing.

357
00:37:30,038 --> 00:37:32,201
[SPEAKER_06]: High poverty, high free and reduced lunch,

358
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:36,612
[SPEAKER_06]: English language learners, newcomers to the country.

359
00:37:38,113 --> 00:37:39,694
[SPEAKER_06]: There are a lot of factors.

360
00:37:40,494 --> 00:37:49,200
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want it to sound like I'm making an excuse, but a lot of the schools are trauma-charged, and I don't say that lightly.

361
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,281
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a reality.

362
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:59,307
[SPEAKER_06]: And so how teachers have to teach the children now, they have to really use a lot of different strategies.

363
00:37:59,367 --> 00:38:00,588
[SPEAKER_06]: They have to take care of

364
00:38:02,506 --> 00:38:04,927
[SPEAKER_06]: the child, the whole child first, I would say.

365
00:38:05,027 --> 00:38:17,814
[SPEAKER_06]: They have to look at, is this child ready to do the work that I'm gonna put before them, or does this child need some other kind of intervention before I can even start teaching the academic content?

366
00:38:18,634 --> 00:38:29,400
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would say, I know the Boston Magazine, they would write their piece based on strictly numbers, what's black and white and what's factual.

367
00:38:30,464 --> 00:38:40,751
[SPEAKER_06]: But what they aren't able to see is what's happening in the schools and what the students are encountering, what they are dealing with, and that they're coming to school every day.

368
00:38:43,193 --> 00:38:44,274
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're coming to learn.

369
00:38:44,334 --> 00:38:45,454
[SPEAKER_06]: They're coming to learn.

370
00:38:45,715 --> 00:38:46,635
[SPEAKER_06]: They want to learn.

371
00:38:47,276 --> 00:38:50,238
[SPEAKER_06]: But there are a lot of challenges and obstacles that they have to overcome.

372
00:38:50,398 --> 00:38:56,362
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's what I feel has led to that decline.

373
00:38:56,892 --> 00:39:04,095
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we are back at the drawing board once again, trying to figure out, okay, what's the next strategy that we need to put in place?

374
00:39:04,496 --> 00:39:09,158
[SPEAKER_06]: And so now we are really, really focusing on social-emotional learning.

375
00:39:09,178 --> 00:39:18,122
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, when I was a teacher in Houston, before that I mostly did private schools, so my experience was more of children of affluence.

376
00:39:18,622 --> 00:39:23,905
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when I started teaching in Houston, it was sort of that big transition of children that had a lot of trauma, a lot of poverty.

377
00:39:24,842 --> 00:39:30,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Thankfully, I had a number of really great principals that sort of helped me adjust my teaching style, which needed adjustment.

378
00:39:30,786 --> 00:39:43,635
[SPEAKER_03]: I wondered, how would you, how do you help teachers like myself, or teachers that don't necessarily come from high trauma, high poverty environments, and how would you educate them to help integrate that into their teaching style?

379
00:39:44,756 --> 00:39:54,382
[SPEAKER_06]: So first and foremost, I would want to ensure that all teachers have a growth mindset and believe first and foremost that the children actually can learn.

380
00:39:55,114 --> 00:40:01,680
[SPEAKER_06]: because sometimes people have a deficit mindset and they say, well, they don't speak English or they have a disability.

381
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,841
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not going to be able to get this anyway.

382
00:40:04,042 --> 00:40:06,203
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to focus on them.

383
00:40:06,564 --> 00:40:10,347
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I think the first piece would be to make sure that they have a growth mindset.

384
00:40:11,088 --> 00:40:14,350
[SPEAKER_06]: We are teaching children and we all make mistakes even as adults.

385
00:40:14,891 --> 00:40:19,495
[SPEAKER_06]: So as a teacher, I love teaching, even working with teachers, giving teachers feedback.

386
00:40:20,451 --> 00:40:46,718
[SPEAKER_06]: it's important to be able to observe the practice, observe the work, go in, see what are the teachers doing, what's happening, are you using strategies, are you using sheltered instruction, I think of the sheltered instruction observation protocol, which talks about allowing additional wait time, using the visuals, speaking at, not speaking at a rapid rate of speed,

387
00:40:47,398 --> 00:40:54,179
[SPEAKER_06]: so that the students can actually hear and catch the words of what you're saying so they're able to piece it together and make sense.

388
00:40:54,619 --> 00:41:04,321
[SPEAKER_06]: So in terms of helping a teacher, if a teacher came from a parochial school or a private school or from a school of affluence and they're teaching in a high-need school, they're still teaching children.

389
00:41:04,901 --> 00:41:09,062
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like you're teaching children in one location and you're teaching puppies in another.

390
00:41:09,422 --> 00:41:10,562
[SPEAKER_06]: You are teaching children.

391
00:41:10,702 --> 00:41:13,723
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I believe that all children can be taught

392
00:41:14,392 --> 00:41:19,413
[SPEAKER_06]: and that it's the mindset and a willingness to learn, and that everyone can grow together.

393
00:41:19,994 --> 00:41:23,354
[SPEAKER_03]: And finally on this topic, I sort of want to take a case study real quick.

394
00:41:23,915 --> 00:41:38,599
[SPEAKER_03]: I was reading through the Department of Education, the 2015-2016 reports, and it was showing how minority children and children with disabilities are often disciplined at higher rates with more severe outcomes.

395
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:43,480
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would like to sort of create a case study, and I would like you to imagine a teacher

396
00:41:44,218 --> 00:41:56,148
[SPEAKER_03]: that you notice a similar trend, that for similar discipline situations, they tend to be disciplining children who are minorities and children in poverty with disabilities at a more severe rate.

397
00:41:56,608 --> 00:42:00,892
[SPEAKER_03]: How would you adjust that teacher's style, and how would you communicate the problem to that teacher?

398
00:42:02,673 --> 00:42:04,715
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes teachers aren't even aware.

399
00:42:06,316 --> 00:42:09,079
[SPEAKER_06]: In Boston, it's a real issue.

400
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:10,500
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a gap.

401
00:42:11,127 --> 00:42:17,149
[SPEAKER_06]: that if you walk into rooms with students, sub-separate rooms with students with disabilities, all you will see is black and brown.

402
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:20,550
[SPEAKER_06]: And on top of that, all you'll usually see are males.

403
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:22,671
[SPEAKER_06]: You might see one girl.

404
00:42:24,472 --> 00:42:29,473
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it's something that has happened, and I've seen it happen.

405
00:42:30,113 --> 00:42:33,815
[SPEAKER_06]: But sometimes teachers don't realize the data.

406
00:42:33,895 --> 00:42:34,995
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna go back to that.

407
00:42:35,215 --> 00:42:37,576
[SPEAKER_06]: When I was an assistant principal,

408
00:42:38,536 --> 00:42:41,577
[SPEAKER_06]: and I took over for an interim piece of time.

409
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:51,300
[SPEAKER_06]: In a two week period at the school, I processed 250 discipline incident reports in 10 days.

410
00:42:52,581 --> 00:42:56,962
[SPEAKER_06]: And I went to the principal and said, is this normal?

411
00:42:57,623 --> 00:43:01,524
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I was a classroom teacher and I came out to cover a leave.

412
00:43:02,652 --> 00:43:04,253
[SPEAKER_06]: And he said, this is not normal.

413
00:43:05,294 --> 00:43:07,975
[SPEAKER_06]: And so he said, disaggregate the data.

414
00:43:09,076 --> 00:43:16,621
[SPEAKER_06]: And when I went through the 250 incident reports, 50 incident reports were from one classroom.

415
00:43:18,342 --> 00:43:24,145
[SPEAKER_06]: And so he called the staff meeting, and at the staff meeting, we presented the data.

416
00:43:25,046 --> 00:43:27,087
[SPEAKER_06]: So I believe in letting the data do the talking.

417
00:43:27,667 --> 00:43:30,049
[SPEAKER_06]: And so the data was to the staff,

418
00:43:30,697 --> 00:43:33,920
[SPEAKER_06]: We had 250 incident reports in a 10-day time frame.

419
00:43:35,181 --> 00:43:39,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Once the entire school body heard that, everyone was surprised.

420
00:43:40,366 --> 00:43:46,733
[SPEAKER_06]: And we did not say any names, but we did say 50 incident reports came from one classroom.

421
00:43:47,995 --> 00:43:49,616
[SPEAKER_06]: Eight came from another classroom.

422
00:43:51,076 --> 00:44:11,646
[SPEAKER_06]: And when they realized that these 250 incident reports were generated from a very small segment of the school community, and it was made public, without any names, the following week, there was a miraculous improvement, and we had 50 incident reports.

423
00:44:12,186 --> 00:44:13,867
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, this was a high-need school,

424
00:44:15,793 --> 00:44:18,255
[SPEAKER_06]: with probably 600 students.

425
00:44:19,376 --> 00:44:29,302
[SPEAKER_06]: And at that time we did have a special set of students that had behavioral challenges, so we had a sub-separate classroom for students with behavioral challenges.

426
00:44:29,942 --> 00:44:34,846
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we brought the incident reports down to 50, which was the normal

427
00:44:36,107 --> 00:44:38,650
[SPEAKER_06]: For that size school, that was a normal expectation.

428
00:44:38,930 --> 00:44:41,953
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, the incident report was just so you could know what was happening.

429
00:44:42,614 --> 00:44:47,478
[SPEAKER_06]: So thinking about what you're saying, I would say the same thing, presenting the data.

430
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:52,103
[SPEAKER_06]: Present the data to the principals, present the data.

431
00:44:52,583 --> 00:44:59,951
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a particular school that has the highest number of discipline referrals?

432
00:45:00,521 --> 00:45:02,862
[SPEAKER_06]: and or special ed referrals?

433
00:45:03,362 --> 00:45:05,903
[SPEAKER_06]: And if so, let's investigate why.

434
00:45:06,863 --> 00:45:08,223
[SPEAKER_06]: And let's investigate who.

435
00:45:09,224 --> 00:45:15,526
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it a school that has a special needs population of students that have behavioral concerns?

436
00:45:16,366 --> 00:45:19,467
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it a school that has high English language learner populations?

437
00:45:19,907 --> 00:45:22,268
[SPEAKER_06]: What are the challenges at that particular school?

438
00:45:22,668 --> 00:45:23,988
[SPEAKER_06]: And then unpack it from there.

439
00:45:24,028 --> 00:45:25,249
[SPEAKER_06]: This is what the data says.

440
00:45:25,709 --> 00:45:27,649
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you help me understand what the data says?

441
00:45:28,009 --> 00:45:29,650
[SPEAKER_06]: Now let's come up with an action plan

442
00:45:30,069 --> 00:45:32,690
[SPEAKER_06]: to address this, because it's not acceptable.

443
00:45:33,890 --> 00:45:34,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

444
00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:35,490
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

445
00:45:36,490 --> 00:45:44,232
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Russo.

446
00:45:44,292 --> 00:45:47,333
[SPEAKER_04]: How does recess fit into a school system under your leadership?

447
00:45:50,113 --> 00:45:50,614
[SPEAKER_06]: Recess.

448
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:52,694
[SPEAKER_06]: I am an advocate of recess.

449
00:45:53,514 --> 00:45:57,075
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe children need to get out and stretch and

450
00:45:58,653 --> 00:46:00,174
[SPEAKER_06]: play and have fresh air.

451
00:46:01,234 --> 00:46:06,577
[SPEAKER_06]: So at the elementary levels, it should be a non-negotiable.

452
00:46:07,337 --> 00:46:20,022
[SPEAKER_06]: And for middle schools, I'm not sure if at the middle school level here, children do have recess, but I believe in children being able to have time to go outside, to stretch, to play, to run.

453
00:46:20,663 --> 00:46:22,904
[SPEAKER_06]: It's good for their heart.

454
00:46:23,044 --> 00:46:26,185
[SPEAKER_06]: It's good for them to be able to come back into the classroom

455
00:46:26,798 --> 00:46:30,300
[SPEAKER_06]: after lunch and be able to learn for the second half of the day.

456
00:46:31,061 --> 00:46:46,510
[SPEAKER_06]: So I am an advocate of recess, and I think it's important just for helping kids to stay healthy, giving them an opportunity to socialize outside of the instructional day, as opposed to wanting to socialize during instructional time in the classroom.

457
00:46:48,531 --> 00:46:55,796
[SPEAKER_04]: And do you think that recess should ever be used, should ever be removed as part of disciplinary action?

458
00:46:56,977 --> 00:46:59,118
[SPEAKER_06]: So recess as punishment is what you're saying.

459
00:46:59,278 --> 00:47:00,739
[SPEAKER_04]: Should you ever take away recess?

460
00:47:06,722 --> 00:47:13,145
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, I personally believe that we really should not use recess as punishment.

461
00:47:14,226 --> 00:47:16,787
[SPEAKER_06]: That we should keep it separate.

462
00:47:18,108 --> 00:47:24,791
[SPEAKER_06]: But you also have to look at each situation respectively and be able to say, for example,

463
00:47:26,041 --> 00:47:30,243
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it a child that's physically assaulting other children at recess?

464
00:47:30,604 --> 00:47:40,068
[SPEAKER_06]: So now at the end of recess, five children are going to the nurse to say that I was kicked on the playground or I was physically assaulted.

465
00:47:40,448 --> 00:47:49,653
[SPEAKER_06]: Then in that particular situation, I would say recess is an opportunity for children to play, to socialize, and have a good time.

466
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:54,785
[SPEAKER_06]: For this particular incident, you used recess in the wrong way.

467
00:47:54,845 --> 00:47:55,926
[SPEAKER_06]: You made a poor decision.

468
00:47:56,246 --> 00:47:58,629
[SPEAKER_06]: You physically hurt some of your classmates.

469
00:47:59,030 --> 00:48:06,959
[SPEAKER_06]: So today, you have to spend recess with me or whoever the designee, I mean, I wouldn't be at the school, but the school leader, the principal could say that.

470
00:48:07,674 --> 00:48:19,623
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, but personally, I believe children should be able to have recess, but if there is an extenuating circumstance and they feel that recess needs to be taken away, it should be taken away for a short period of time.

471
00:48:19,983 --> 00:48:27,028
[SPEAKER_06]: You should not say, I'm taking away recess for a month, like when you ground your child and say, you know, no TB for two weeks.

472
00:48:27,428 --> 00:48:29,230
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I don't believe in something like that.

473
00:48:29,770 --> 00:48:30,070
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

474
00:48:31,331 --> 00:48:31,491
[SPEAKER_10]: Ms.

475
00:48:31,511 --> 00:48:32,012
[SPEAKER_10]: Van der Kloot.

476
00:48:33,032 --> 00:48:33,533
[SPEAKER_10]: Dr. Vincent.

477
00:48:35,003 --> 00:48:40,709
[SPEAKER_07]: We've spoken about some of your successes, but I want to hear how you've been tested.

478
00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:52,282
[SPEAKER_07]: So could you speak about, I'll say, two occasions where you did not succeed in something or where you actually failed and what you learned from it?

479
00:49:05,123 --> 00:49:05,663
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm thinking.

480
00:49:06,843 --> 00:49:14,666
[SPEAKER_07]: It could be like an implementation of a program not going well or an interaction with a student's family for something, whatever.

481
00:49:25,528 --> 00:49:26,389
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I'm biased.

482
00:49:26,429 --> 00:49:29,469
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just thinking of so many bright spots right now.

483
00:49:32,102 --> 00:49:33,783
[SPEAKER_06]: Something that did not go well.

484
00:49:40,208 --> 00:49:44,171
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm thinking about one of the times a schedule change.

485
00:49:49,375 --> 00:49:53,718
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the times I, as a principal, I ended up changing the schedule.

486
00:49:55,460 --> 00:50:00,864
[SPEAKER_06]: And I took some liberties.

487
00:50:01,539 --> 00:50:02,520
[SPEAKER_06]: in changing the schedule.

488
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:08,985
[SPEAKER_06]: And I wanted to move to a 60-minute block.

489
00:50:10,126 --> 00:50:14,509
[SPEAKER_06]: But according to the contract, it should have been 48 minutes.

490
00:50:15,610 --> 00:50:20,894
[SPEAKER_06]: And so myself, 48 minutes, I was like, 48, 50, 60, no big deal.

491
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:43,344
[SPEAKER_06]: But what I was thinking was when I changed to the 60-minute block schedule from the 48 minutes, the teachers ended up with a 60-minute planning period as well as opposed to the 48 minutes.

492
00:50:44,745 --> 00:50:52,051
[SPEAKER_06]: But for the specialists that were teaching during the planning period, it was a 60-minute block.

493
00:50:52,752 --> 00:50:54,393
[SPEAKER_06]: And so there was tension.

494
00:50:55,151 --> 00:51:12,535
[SPEAKER_06]: because some people loved having the 60 minutes because they felt like you could actually do more during that block of time, but because it was in violation of the contract, we had to go back to the 48 minutes to respect the contract.

495
00:51:14,115 --> 00:51:21,276
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I had taken that liberty, and then afterwards there was more discussion, but that was one of the times where I

496
00:51:24,747 --> 00:51:27,208
[SPEAKER_06]: was eager and I was like, okay, this is the new schedule.

497
00:51:27,928 --> 00:51:32,709
[SPEAKER_06]: And I had to go back and say, I'm sorry, this couldn't work.

498
00:51:33,169 --> 00:51:34,529
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to go back to 48 minutes.

499
00:51:34,549 --> 00:51:36,330
[SPEAKER_06]: So we did go back to the 48-minute schedule.

500
00:51:36,670 --> 00:51:36,890
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

501
00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:37,890
[SPEAKER_07]: Good.

502
00:51:38,010 --> 00:51:38,350
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

503
00:51:39,770 --> 00:51:40,611
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I ask another one?

504
00:51:40,631 --> 00:51:40,851
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

505
00:51:41,091 --> 00:51:42,811
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

506
00:51:43,791 --> 00:51:45,412
[SPEAKER_07]: So we've touched a little bit on this.

507
00:51:45,432 --> 00:51:46,132
[SPEAKER_07]: You mentioned this.

508
00:51:47,052 --> 00:51:50,773
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the things that students are presenting with is increasing levels of anxiety.

509
00:51:51,437 --> 00:51:56,921
[SPEAKER_07]: How do you balance the emotional needs of the students while maintaining academic rigor?

510
00:51:57,181 --> 00:52:02,304
[SPEAKER_07]: And can you give me any specific examples how you've handled that in your schools?

511
00:52:05,986 --> 00:52:09,909
[SPEAKER_06]: So balancing academic rigor with the social emotional needs of the child.

512
00:52:22,368 --> 00:52:29,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Currently, I have several schools that have integrated sensory rooms.

513
00:52:30,950 --> 00:52:48,193
[SPEAKER_06]: And so in these rooms, it's a space within the school where there are squishies, there are beanbags, there could be balls, because students do have, go into crisis or do have moments of difficulty where they're not functioning in the classroom.

514
00:52:48,959 --> 00:53:01,962
[SPEAKER_06]: So for schools that have been able to design this sensory space, we've been using that as an alternative, one school calls it an alternative learning environment.

515
00:53:02,142 --> 00:53:14,485
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not something that is used for the entire day, but it's something that's used for the student to have an opportunity to de-escalate and to be able to return to the classroom to participate in their learning.

516
00:53:15,316 --> 00:53:43,338
[SPEAKER_06]: So that would be something that I would definitely say I would advocate for if the school has the physical ability, the physical space to create this alternative learning environment for students that may have severe anxiety, may be dealing with trauma, or something that is overwhelming them, that's preventing them from functioning within the classroom setting.

517
00:53:45,140 --> 00:54:13,561
[SPEAKER_06]: At the same time, you would need to have personnel, and again, the staffing for that, whether it's a paraprofessional, or whether you have itinerants, sometimes, you know, looking at the flexible scheduling, so if you were to have an OT or a PT person who has a free period, and you could say during this time of the day, I will be in the alternative learning space, so that sometimes you can even say to children, you can't go to the space right now,

518
00:54:15,134 --> 00:54:21,098
[SPEAKER_06]: one o'clock you'll be able to go to this space and have that opportunity.

519
00:54:21,639 --> 00:54:32,967
[SPEAKER_06]: I've also seen low tech things such as just having a tent, a small little tent in a classroom and some classrooms just have it labeled like cool down area.

520
00:54:33,848 --> 00:54:42,714
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like camp cool down and so sometimes just having an area that you have sensory tools, things that they can squeeze or touch or maybe color.

521
00:54:43,959 --> 00:54:46,801
[SPEAKER_06]: to be intentional about having a toolkit.

522
00:54:47,302 --> 00:54:52,285
[SPEAKER_06]: Another school has little shoeboxes that are social-emotional.

523
00:54:52,665 --> 00:54:56,248
[SPEAKER_06]: They're like little toolboxes that have social-emotional tools within them.

524
00:54:56,949 --> 00:55:10,639
[SPEAKER_06]: So I feel like the way to address it is to address it proactively, not waiting for something to happen, but already have it in place so that when a child is in crisis, you have

525
00:55:11,587 --> 00:55:19,915
[SPEAKER_06]: a plan of action, and then that will allow you, the teacher, to be able to teach the rest of the class or the rest of the students.

526
00:55:20,676 --> 00:55:31,846
[SPEAKER_06]: If, as a teacher, you get bogged down too much with what's happening social-emotionally with a child, then the instruction is not moving forward.

527
00:55:32,226 --> 00:55:33,668
[SPEAKER_06]: So even with trauma,

528
00:55:35,509 --> 00:55:44,271
[SPEAKER_06]: traumatic incidents or students that are dealing with severe anxiety, you cannot water down the content.

529
00:55:44,691 --> 00:55:54,514
[SPEAKER_06]: You cannot water down your instruction because it might be two students, it could be three students in the classroom, but what about the remaining students that aren't having that issue?

530
00:55:55,034 --> 00:56:05,037
[SPEAKER_06]: So I feel you have to have a plan in place, a robust plan to address social emotional needs, but at the same time balance that with

531
00:56:05,373 --> 00:56:07,574
[SPEAKER_06]: this is the content, this is what I'm teaching.

532
00:56:08,295 --> 00:56:10,216
[SPEAKER_06]: And is what I'm teaching engaging?

533
00:56:10,296 --> 00:56:19,081
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I feel like what's being taught also needs to be cognitively demanding and engaging for the students so that they want to do the work.

534
00:56:21,603 --> 00:56:23,584
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you feel that I responded to your question?

535
00:56:23,764 --> 00:56:24,024
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

536
00:56:25,270 --> 00:56:28,531
[SPEAKER_11]: Could you describe your direct follow-up, Paul?

537
00:56:28,731 --> 00:56:29,192
[SPEAKER_11]: A follow-up?

538
00:56:29,432 --> 00:56:33,093
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but when you get a chance, I have a question from Sebastian and from Justin.

539
00:56:33,173 --> 00:56:33,814
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, certainly.

540
00:56:33,834 --> 00:56:34,794
[SPEAKER_11]: You can throw it in.

541
00:56:35,314 --> 00:56:37,775
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a question from our, we have two student reps.

542
00:56:38,415 --> 00:56:39,196
[SPEAKER_11]: You met Justin.

543
00:56:39,276 --> 00:56:40,076
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I did meet Justin.

544
00:56:40,096 --> 00:56:44,618
[SPEAKER_11]: They're both visiting with Chief Justice Breyer this evening at Tufts.

545
00:56:44,918 --> 00:56:45,678
[SPEAKER_11]: That seems kind of boring.

546
00:56:45,698 --> 00:56:46,559
[SPEAKER_11]: They will be here later.

547
00:56:46,579 --> 00:56:48,180
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, wait, really?

548
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,640
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know.

549
00:56:50,781 --> 00:56:53,442
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds pretty cool.

550
00:56:53,462 --> 00:56:54,663
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's see here.

551
00:56:55,603 --> 00:56:59,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you believe that civic engagement should be a part of the education process?

552
00:57:00,085 --> 00:57:07,589
[SPEAKER_04]: And if so, what programs or policies would you continue or begin to foster civic engagement?

553
00:57:07,809 --> 00:57:08,489
[SPEAKER_04]: And if not, why?

554
00:57:11,208 --> 00:57:13,270
[SPEAKER_10]: Put her on FaceTime, send her.

555
00:57:13,350 --> 00:57:15,471
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a lot better, I know, sorry.

556
00:57:15,751 --> 00:57:16,892
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't write the question, so.

557
00:57:17,072 --> 00:57:26,158
[SPEAKER_06]: So, no, civic engagement, yes, I believe strongly in civic engagement, especially at the high school levels where they are getting ready to vote at the age of 18.

558
00:57:26,238 --> 00:57:35,984
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very important to educate and inform children and students, young adults, how to be responsible citizens.

559
00:57:36,573 --> 00:57:37,634
[SPEAKER_06]: and what their rights are.

560
00:57:38,115 --> 00:57:43,680
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would be an advocate of promoting opportunities for students to engage in that.

561
00:57:44,280 --> 00:58:00,676
[SPEAKER_06]: And there are debate leagues and all of those things where students have those opportunities, but also, I would say, creating opportunities, creating forums here at the schools to have discussions.

562
00:58:01,209 --> 00:58:10,716
[SPEAKER_06]: on issues that could be, you know, in the media right now, what's happening, almost kind of like, you know, what's social studies, what is currently happening in our world.

563
00:58:11,256 --> 00:58:18,041
[SPEAKER_06]: So providing students with those opportunities to talk about it, to debate about it, and to engage in discussions and set it up.

564
00:58:18,081 --> 00:58:19,763
[SPEAKER_06]: You can set it up in a formal structure.

565
00:58:20,343 --> 00:58:24,186
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would work very collaboratively with the history team, the history teachers.

566
00:58:24,622 --> 00:58:32,946
[SPEAKER_06]: to say let's try to make this a more formalized process or a frequent process so the students are informed.

567
00:58:35,307 --> 00:58:37,008
[SPEAKER_11]: If I could just follow up a little bit.

568
00:58:37,148 --> 00:58:39,909
[SPEAKER_11]: Obviously, Boston was at the center of the walkout.

569
00:58:40,754 --> 00:58:41,694
[SPEAKER_11]: Medford joined in.

570
00:58:42,275 --> 00:58:47,637
[SPEAKER_11]: We missed the national day like every other community around here with the snow and the kids still went into town.

571
00:58:48,217 --> 00:58:58,941
[SPEAKER_11]: Could you describe what role you played in figuring out the safety nets for the students that were going to walk out on any given Wednesday and or that particular one?

572
00:58:59,721 --> 00:59:06,383
[SPEAKER_06]: So specifically right now that baton was officially handed over to the operational side of the house.

573
00:59:06,403 --> 00:59:07,824
[SPEAKER_06]: So the operational superintendents

574
00:59:08,827 --> 00:59:35,250
[SPEAKER_06]: support that, but what we've done in the past with the walkouts that the students have participated in is we have administrators on the key train stations at the checkpoints, so if we know, we usually know in advance which schools are they walking out from, which particular high schools, and myself, I went down to City Hall, so all of central office was kind of deployed,

575
00:59:35,856 --> 00:59:39,117
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we went to, so there were definitely a lot of adults there.

576
00:59:39,597 --> 00:59:50,101
[SPEAKER_06]: The students were allowed to go to, you know, to actively engage in the process, but there were adults there.

577
00:59:50,201 --> 00:59:53,762
[SPEAKER_06]: Within the train stations, transit police were notified.

578
00:59:54,723 --> 00:59:57,123
[SPEAKER_06]: We knew they were on the T. School police were notified.

579
00:59:57,204 --> 01:00:01,505
[SPEAKER_06]: So we did have strategic checkpoints.

580
01:00:01,585 --> 01:00:04,266
[SPEAKER_06]: Safety was aware, like every, all hands on deck.

581
01:00:04,810 --> 01:00:08,033
[SPEAKER_06]: to ensure that students remain safe.

582
01:00:08,453 --> 01:00:11,476
[SPEAKER_06]: And for the most part, they do remain safe.

583
01:00:11,536 --> 01:00:18,221
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes they end up getting into a scuffle, but there are enough adults there to intervene.

584
01:00:18,701 --> 01:00:26,128
[SPEAKER_06]: So even though it does happen, we have deployed the other adult staff to be able to support the process.

585
01:00:26,188 --> 01:00:29,130
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you have some students that chose not to participate?

586
01:00:29,710 --> 01:00:32,653
[SPEAKER_11]: And what did you have in place for them instructionally?

587
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:34,401
[SPEAKER_11]: if they remained at school?

588
01:00:34,501 --> 01:00:38,844
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, the students that did not participate in the walkout remained at school and they were taught.

589
01:00:39,745 --> 01:00:44,608
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, instruction always continued.

590
01:00:44,668 --> 01:00:49,531
[SPEAKER_06]: So for students that were not doing it, they continued to be taught.

591
01:00:50,432 --> 01:01:00,719
[SPEAKER_06]: And sometimes they may have them, some schools had them go to an auditorium, so they did kind of an assembly for the students that did not go, but just to acknowledge that it was happening.

592
01:01:01,192 --> 01:01:07,396
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, we strongly encourage them to stay in school and that they should be in school during the school day.

593
01:01:08,037 --> 01:01:10,238
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, that's not what happened.

594
01:01:10,278 --> 01:01:13,020
[SPEAKER_06]: So we had to go to plan B. Thank you.

595
01:01:14,281 --> 01:01:21,526
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that obviously was a result of a threat assessment that was performed pretty much in all of our school systems.

596
01:01:21,726 --> 01:01:27,430
[SPEAKER_11]: What direct role have you played in threat assessments and crisis management in the Boston schools?

597
01:01:30,911 --> 01:01:35,414
[SPEAKER_06]: With schools, I've been in schools when we've gone into safe mode.

598
01:01:36,615 --> 01:01:39,918
[SPEAKER_06]: That's been several times since I was in one of the highest needs area.

599
01:01:40,438 --> 01:01:44,221
[SPEAKER_06]: So once that does happen when you're physically at a school, everyone is trained.

600
01:01:45,562 --> 01:01:48,204
[SPEAKER_06]: They make the announcement, we know what's happening.

601
01:01:48,904 --> 01:01:59,152
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a system called Crisis Go in Boston where it's an app and it goes to all key central office administrators.

602
01:01:59,525 --> 01:02:07,386
[SPEAKER_06]: So it lets us know if something is happening at one of the 125 schools at any given moment.

603
01:02:07,906 --> 01:02:11,867
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we have a robust safety team.

604
01:02:12,527 --> 01:02:17,728
[SPEAKER_06]: So when that happens, they are deployed and they will head over to the school.

605
01:02:17,828 --> 01:02:27,870
[SPEAKER_06]: And depending on whose teaching and learning team it's within, then that respective instructional superintendent and our operational superintendent will go to provide support.

606
01:02:28,297 --> 01:02:29,097
[SPEAKER_06]: at that location.

607
01:02:29,678 --> 01:02:34,540
[SPEAKER_06]: So I am not necessarily the one who is saying, okay, I'm calling the police.

608
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:43,284
[SPEAKER_06]: But if I'm notified first, I will talk with the operational superintendent, pass the baton on, and we start the ball rolling from there.

609
01:02:43,464 --> 01:02:44,844
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it goes out on crisis go.

610
01:02:45,184 --> 01:02:46,545
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you play a role in the training?

611
01:02:47,345 --> 01:02:47,826
[SPEAKER_06]: In the training?

612
01:02:47,946 --> 01:02:49,326
[SPEAKER_06]: I do not directly train.

613
01:02:49,466 --> 01:02:52,107
[SPEAKER_06]: I've participated in trainings, but I am not.

614
01:02:52,728 --> 01:02:57,170
[SPEAKER_06]: We bring in professionals, we bring in the police, the police are

615
01:02:58,629 --> 01:03:01,892
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we have designated Boston police that are school police officers.

616
01:03:02,452 --> 01:03:10,438
[SPEAKER_06]: And so they are all hands on deck, you know, deeply involved.

617
01:03:10,839 --> 01:03:17,604
[SPEAKER_06]: So some trainings will happen at central office or trainings will happen at specific school sites.

618
01:03:17,824 --> 01:03:24,029
[SPEAKER_06]: If there's a particular crisis going on, then we realize, okay, let's do it here at this place.

619
01:03:24,798 --> 01:03:29,479
[SPEAKER_06]: So trainings are available, and support personnel are available.

620
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:37,622
[SPEAKER_06]: And we partner closely with school police and Boston police, because there are Boston police that are designated to BPS.

621
01:03:38,102 --> 01:03:38,422
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good.

622
01:03:38,582 --> 01:03:38,922
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

623
01:03:39,562 --> 01:03:39,722
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

624
01:03:39,742 --> 01:03:40,102
[SPEAKER_11]: Mastone.

625
01:03:43,844 --> 01:03:48,805
[SPEAKER_08]: So another big concern of parents that I received emails is about the upkeep

626
01:03:49,167 --> 01:03:51,028
[SPEAKER_08]: and maintenance of our school buildings.

627
01:03:51,789 --> 01:04:01,596
[SPEAKER_08]: So do you have experience with budget for upkeep and maintenance, or is that something that you see in your current BPS?

628
01:04:01,636 --> 01:04:05,919
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that something you've dealt with before with your schools that you are the superintendent of?

629
01:04:06,519 --> 01:04:12,683
[SPEAKER_06]: So for upkeep and maintenance, we do have a large... I know it sounds like... We have a lot of teams.

630
01:04:12,723 --> 01:04:16,626
[SPEAKER_06]: So we do have... We have a grounds crew and we have maintenance crew.

631
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:30,421
[SPEAKER_06]: So depending, you know, my first school was on three city blocks, so depending on the physical location and layout of the school, that would determine how much support or how little support you receive.

632
01:04:31,061 --> 01:04:41,330
[SPEAKER_06]: But the maintenance of schools, like the lawn being cut or flowers or mulch, snow shovel removal,

633
01:04:42,334 --> 01:04:43,694
[SPEAKER_06]: Custodians help with that.

634
01:04:44,195 --> 01:04:45,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Materials are delivered.

635
01:04:45,555 --> 01:04:50,576
[SPEAKER_06]: If stuff isn't delivered, we call the supervisors right away to say this needs to be done.

636
01:04:51,397 --> 01:04:53,037
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a lot of outdoor classrooms.

637
01:04:53,537 --> 01:05:07,841
[SPEAKER_06]: So now that the winter, the snow is finally melting away, so the outdoor classrooms will need, so the grounds crew will come and they will prune and they'll get the outdoor classrooms back up to par so that the students can go out and use them.

638
01:05:08,328 --> 01:05:15,614
[SPEAKER_06]: So in terms of looking at it from a specific budgetary perspective, it's already embedded within the school budget.

639
01:05:15,634 --> 01:05:18,176
[SPEAKER_08]: So is there a line budget item that says grounds?

640
01:05:18,196 --> 01:05:20,438
[SPEAKER_06]: Not on the specific school one.

641
01:05:20,558 --> 01:05:24,001
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just embedded within the district budget.

642
01:05:24,021 --> 01:05:24,201
[SPEAKER_06]: Got it.

643
01:05:24,481 --> 01:05:26,303
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're not going to see it say that.

644
01:05:26,383 --> 01:05:37,912
[SPEAKER_06]: But if something needs to be done, or if a building is not clean, when I go into a building, or if a parent ends up saying the girls' bathroom or the boys' bathroom,

645
01:05:38,929 --> 01:05:42,850
[SPEAKER_06]: The boys' bathroom sometimes is not the cleanest.

646
01:05:43,410 --> 01:05:47,871
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just say that because they like to play there.

647
01:05:48,431 --> 01:05:54,452
[SPEAKER_06]: And so sometimes the reports will come back and it will be like, this needs to be done.

648
01:05:54,652 --> 01:06:07,155
[SPEAKER_06]: So we also, if I'm called in and we go into the boys' bathroom and really see like, you know what, we can't wait until after third lunch for the boys' bathroom to be cleaned, it needs to be cleaned after

649
01:06:07,665 --> 01:06:23,851
[SPEAKER_06]: every lunch, then that could be something that I would speak to the custodial supervisor about to say like, we really need for maintenance purposes and for health cleanliness purposes, we need a more frequent pass over the restrooms at lunchtime.

650
01:06:24,311 --> 01:06:28,953
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have that flexibility and the school leaders have that flexibility to be able to say that.

651
01:06:29,553 --> 01:06:33,915
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's about safety first, but it's also about the health and sanitation.

652
01:06:33,955 --> 01:06:36,416
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't want children using dirty facilities.

653
01:06:37,418 --> 01:06:41,359
[SPEAKER_06]: and you don't want them having health problems because they don't want to use the facilities.

654
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:45,421
[SPEAKER_06]: So that is a serious need and it should definitely be addressed.

655
01:06:45,961 --> 01:06:48,122
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know you've had many different roles.

656
01:06:48,202 --> 01:06:55,845
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you had in one of your roles the responsibility to write a whole school budget and what was that like for you or how did it play out?

657
01:06:56,745 --> 01:07:01,267
[SPEAKER_06]: So our budgets in Boston are based on a weighted student funding.

658
01:07:02,147 --> 01:07:04,328
[SPEAKER_06]: So the budget process

659
01:07:05,123 --> 01:07:09,992
[SPEAKER_06]: is I've worked with budgets and I work with all of my schools on their budget.

660
01:07:10,012 --> 01:07:14,519
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a budget collaborative process, a very long elaborative process.

661
01:07:15,461 --> 01:07:17,184
[SPEAKER_06]: Elaborate, elaborate, I'm sorry.

662
01:07:17,645 --> 01:07:29,617
[SPEAKER_06]: But what I can say is in terms of working with the budgets, the majority of the budget is normally consumed by human resources, all of the people.

663
01:07:29,997 --> 01:07:39,086
[SPEAKER_06]: By the time you pay for people benefits, you are left with a very small amount of money, grant money that may be targeted for ELLs,

664
01:07:40,049 --> 01:07:50,374
[SPEAKER_06]: grant money targeted for students with disabilities, and there's a very small amount of money that you're left with that you have wiggle room.

665
01:07:50,935 --> 01:07:59,419
[SPEAKER_06]: But even with that amount of money that you are left with, I do work with principals and talking with them to say, how are you gonna be strategic about the use of these funds?

666
01:08:00,299 --> 01:08:09,084
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes they allocate, it could be 10,000 towards stipends, because they're planning on doing professional development or special projects with teachers,

667
01:08:09,778 --> 01:08:13,600
[SPEAKER_06]: a certain amount of money from that pool towards field trips.

668
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:23,745
[SPEAKER_06]: So there were certain things that they allocate up front, and then whatever's left over, they pursue partnerships with community partners.

669
01:08:25,206 --> 01:08:25,486
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

670
01:08:25,786 --> 01:08:29,008
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I guess could I just follow up with that, just because you had mentioned community partners.

671
01:08:29,328 --> 01:08:35,291
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you speak about partnerships that you've created or that you would like to see created in Medford that aren't currently here?

672
01:08:39,617 --> 01:08:48,339
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that there are partnerships already with some of the colleges and universities, with Tufts and I believe Harvard.

673
01:08:49,319 --> 01:08:52,859
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like to add the community colleges.

674
01:08:52,879 --> 01:09:05,122
[SPEAKER_06]: I am seriously interested in looking at what I had said earlier about the early college credit for students that are capable to complete

675
01:09:07,014 --> 01:09:12,975
[SPEAKER_06]: the required Mass Corps and have time to be able to push themselves in that area.

676
01:09:13,376 --> 01:09:15,836
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would definitely want to see college partnerships.

677
01:09:16,516 --> 01:09:26,559
[SPEAKER_06]: And for the community, I would definitely be interested in just seeing how we could have other community partners support the school, whether it was with resources.

678
01:09:29,019 --> 01:09:30,020
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm thinking of

679
01:09:33,183 --> 01:09:56,925
[SPEAKER_06]: one of my schools that is generously, receives a lot of generous funds from the New Market Foundation, and so they provide that school, they've given them three sets of, three classroom sets of technology, Chromebooks, and so we do have a lot of schools that are slowly building up their,

680
01:09:58,874 --> 01:10:16,064
[SPEAKER_06]: technology, and so that would be one way to work with community partners that if they're not able to come into the schools as a resource to volunteer and to support, but to be able to support an initiative that is taking place at the school to enhance the school.

681
01:10:16,465 --> 01:10:23,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Because if you can have a partner help provide with technology, then that would be savings for the school.

682
01:10:24,785 --> 01:10:32,568
[SPEAKER_11]: Just as a follow-up, in your application you listed a $2.3 million grant from the O'Shaughnessy Foundation.

683
01:10:33,088 --> 01:10:35,489
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that similar to the New Market or is that another one?

684
01:10:35,609 --> 01:10:47,934
[SPEAKER_06]: The O'Shaughnessy Foundation was a specific grant which was targeted to work with some of our lowest need schools and it brought in coaching and support to those particular schools.

685
01:10:49,127 --> 01:11:01,534
[SPEAKER_06]: So, like pursuing grants, whether it's Nellie Mae or other foundations to pursue monies to supplement what is here at the district, I definitely would be interested in doing that.

686
01:11:01,954 --> 01:11:08,778
[SPEAKER_06]: The New Market Group Foundation, the business group, they support

687
01:11:09,338 --> 01:11:16,464
[SPEAKER_06]: a cluster of schools that are located within a one-mile radius of where they are physically located.

688
01:11:16,944 --> 01:11:28,574
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it's a group of businesses that contribute as a collective, and then they say to the principal, what would you like from us this year?

689
01:11:29,594 --> 01:11:37,381
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I'm saying if there could be an equivalent in Medford to possibly have a group of businesses that

690
01:11:38,419 --> 01:11:47,122
[SPEAKER_06]: work together and say, would you be willing to either adopt a particular school and see what it is, a need that the school may have.

691
01:11:47,762 --> 01:11:48,082
[SPEAKER_11]: Very good.

692
01:11:48,122 --> 01:11:48,462
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

693
01:11:48,942 --> 01:11:49,102
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

694
01:11:49,122 --> 01:11:49,422
[SPEAKER_11]: Koretz.

695
01:11:50,483 --> 01:11:50,763
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello.

696
01:11:51,983 --> 01:11:52,523
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, Doctor.

697
01:11:53,804 --> 01:11:56,885
[SPEAKER_09]: So as you know, this is another vocational question.

698
01:11:57,425 --> 01:12:07,508
[SPEAKER_09]: So how would you work with the school administration to continue to promote the career technical education in Medford, increase the enrollment,

699
01:12:08,032 --> 01:12:11,194
[SPEAKER_09]: and keeping the kids coming to Medford vocational schools.

700
01:12:12,935 --> 01:12:18,358
[SPEAKER_06]: So I believe strongly in marketing, and I also believe strongly in communicating.

701
01:12:18,838 --> 01:12:29,585
[SPEAKER_06]: So as we now have this comprehensive high school that is offering so much, we need to reach back to the middle schools.

702
01:12:30,345 --> 01:12:36,749
[SPEAKER_06]: And even in upper elementary, to start doing an exploratory, I would say at fourth and fifth grades,

703
01:12:37,182 --> 01:12:40,664
[SPEAKER_06]: to start saying to them, do you know when you get to high school?

704
01:12:41,224 --> 01:12:43,426
[SPEAKER_06]: These are all the options that are available to you.

705
01:12:43,986 --> 01:12:54,712
[SPEAKER_06]: Start generating that excitement at the elementary level so that as they work their way up, they're thinking about it and saying, what is it that I would be good at?

706
01:12:54,832 --> 01:12:56,333
[SPEAKER_06]: What is it that I could do?

707
01:12:56,794 --> 01:12:58,735
[SPEAKER_06]: Because this is going to be offered to them.

708
01:12:59,175 --> 01:13:03,978
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, once they get to the high school, they're going to have all of these options.

709
01:13:04,517 --> 01:13:09,338
[SPEAKER_06]: but sometimes it's overwhelming, it's too much, so you need to bring it back earlier.

710
01:13:09,778 --> 01:13:23,721
[SPEAKER_06]: And maybe in middle school, have the middle schoolers come, sixth grade, seventh grade, eighth grade, have them come on a field trip, have them come, do an exploration just to think about it, see what it looks like.

711
01:13:26,141 --> 01:13:33,383
[SPEAKER_06]: We do something in Boston, we did like a science week where kids did hands-on science,

712
01:13:34,882 --> 01:13:51,058
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe to take that as an opportunity to go to the middle schools and give them, maybe it doesn't need to be a full week, but to give them an opportunity to come to the high school and spend maybe two days.

713
01:13:51,939 --> 01:13:52,740
[SPEAKER_06]: Give them time.

714
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:54,982
[SPEAKER_06]: They could still have their regular grade level work.

715
01:13:55,745 --> 01:14:01,207
[SPEAKER_06]: but give them time to explore, actual hands-on experience to explore some of the options.

716
01:14:01,467 --> 01:14:04,348
[SPEAKER_06]: So then it won't seem like a mystery.

717
01:14:04,868 --> 01:14:09,010
[SPEAKER_06]: Now it's going to be like, wow, I want to do this, or I think I'm interested.

718
01:14:09,510 --> 01:14:10,931
[SPEAKER_06]: And so they'll have options.

719
01:14:11,571 --> 01:14:13,352
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they'll have greater options in front of them.

720
01:14:13,392 --> 01:14:14,672
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be my recommendation.

721
01:14:15,252 --> 01:14:16,013
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

722
01:14:16,873 --> 01:14:17,653
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. Benedetto.

723
01:14:18,053 --> 01:14:18,394
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

724
01:14:22,718 --> 01:14:28,881
[SPEAKER_12]: Part of my question was already asked, but could you tell me any experience you might have with collective bargaining?

725
01:14:31,182 --> 01:14:37,686
[SPEAKER_06]: So with collective bargaining, I have not been on an official collective bargaining team.

726
01:14:38,366 --> 01:14:42,468
[SPEAKER_06]: I have been one of the contributors to the collective bargaining.

727
01:14:43,027 --> 01:14:52,551
[SPEAKER_06]: We do have an office of labor relations where they head up what happens with collective bargaining and the office of human capital.

728
01:14:53,811 --> 01:15:04,335
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they ask instructional superintendents, operational superintendents across section, including principals, they will ask us to contribute to

729
01:15:05,816 --> 01:15:09,780
[SPEAKER_06]: what it is that they're going to be presenting as the negotiations come closer.

730
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:26,473
[SPEAKER_06]: So if there are things that, you know, you look at in a particular contract and you end up saying, you know, this is something that we would recommend, they have to also look at what is the cost going to be because you can't, you know, break the bank as it is.

731
01:15:26,553 --> 01:15:30,256
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a $1.1 billion budget and it doesn't seem to be going down.

732
01:15:30,997 --> 01:15:33,759
[SPEAKER_06]: And so in negotiations,

733
01:15:34,443 --> 01:15:39,306
[SPEAKER_06]: it's millions and millions of dollars that end up going to the cost of living increase.

734
01:15:40,087 --> 01:15:48,212
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that's something that has to be taken into consideration.

735
01:15:48,652 --> 01:15:56,578
[SPEAKER_06]: So for collective bargaining, I have not been on the teams, but I've contributed to the work that has been done.

736
01:15:56,978 --> 01:15:57,258
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.

737
01:15:58,579 --> 01:16:01,661
[SPEAKER_12]: My second question is professional development.

738
01:16:02,605 --> 01:16:10,288
[SPEAKER_12]: just your philosophy on it and how it's implemented where you are, if you have any ideas for our school district.

739
01:16:11,689 --> 01:16:14,210
[SPEAKER_06]: So I believe in professional development.

740
01:16:14,750 --> 01:16:17,371
[SPEAKER_06]: We also call it, refer to it as professional learning.

741
01:16:17,811 --> 01:16:24,934
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to keep in mind that we're teaching adults and so adults don't like to be spoken to or spoken at.

742
01:16:25,580 --> 01:16:26,601
[SPEAKER_06]: especially teachers.

743
01:16:27,261 --> 01:16:36,409
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have made a really big attempt to break down our professional learning into smaller learning communities.

744
01:16:37,009 --> 01:16:50,841
[SPEAKER_06]: So we do have professional learning communities right now where they are made up of six to 10 principals in each professional learning community and we rotate

745
01:16:51,772 --> 01:17:07,201
[SPEAKER_06]: The schools that we go to, because it's a reasonable number, I work with one middle school grouping, and I also work, I have one larger group, which is the 15 early childhood schools that are within the district.

746
01:17:07,981 --> 01:17:16,106
[SPEAKER_06]: And so for professional learning, we make sure that it's relevant and appropriate to the age that the children are being taught.

747
01:17:17,356 --> 01:17:27,783
[SPEAKER_06]: And so the professional learning communities, that is how we have been doing the work, in small clustered groupings.

748
01:17:28,323 --> 01:17:41,652
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do believe professional learning should involve some kind of an anchor text, reading, articles, videos, opportunities for principals to be able to turn and talk, share, and learn from one another.

749
01:17:42,212 --> 01:17:45,835
[SPEAKER_06]: So have an opportunity to present their own case studies,

750
01:17:46,624 --> 01:17:52,989
[SPEAKER_06]: and say, this is a challenge I'm working with, and use the collective minds of the group to tackle their challenge.

751
01:17:53,689 --> 01:18:06,159
[SPEAKER_06]: So it should be about their learning, and at the same time, moving forward the district's vision and mission, but improving their learning and keeping them excited about the work that they're doing every day.

752
01:18:07,660 --> 01:18:13,785
[SPEAKER_12]: So speaking of vision, do you have a district vision for MedFed, or an idea of what you think

753
01:18:14,414 --> 01:18:17,236
[SPEAKER_12]: that you would like to see us, how you would like to see us grow?

754
01:18:18,377 --> 01:18:25,663
[SPEAKER_06]: I would love, love to see Medford continue to move forward on their academic trajectory.

755
01:18:26,104 --> 01:18:28,085
[SPEAKER_06]: As I said, with the current system, we are

756
01:18:29,244 --> 01:18:31,306
[SPEAKER_06]: a solid level two district right now.

757
01:18:32,167 --> 01:18:37,672
[SPEAKER_06]: We are fairly, essentially neck and neck with the state, but we have a lot of other cities.

758
01:18:38,013 --> 01:18:46,561
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of them are the Ws that are doing a little better than Medford, and they're level one districts.

759
01:18:47,302 --> 01:18:50,545
[SPEAKER_06]: And I feel that we want to definitely

760
01:18:51,368 --> 01:18:55,932
[SPEAKER_06]: take what we're doing, build upon that, and move the school forward.

761
01:18:56,312 --> 01:18:58,714
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, I was not able to drill down.

762
01:18:59,194 --> 01:19:20,951
[SPEAKER_06]: Looking at the state site, I could only look as available at the global district level and global school level, but to be able to drill down and look at what the data is saying more deeply and be able to come up with a targeted plan to move Medford forward so that we continue on that path, I feel that it is within

763
01:19:21,713 --> 01:19:21,953
[SPEAKER_06]: reach.

764
01:19:21,993 --> 01:19:23,053
[SPEAKER_06]: It's within our grasp.

765
01:19:23,273 --> 01:19:26,974
[SPEAKER_06]: We just have to keep at it and get there.

766
01:19:27,494 --> 01:19:41,357
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, I do want to also just acknowledge the teachers, because in order for a district to be a level two district, the teachers are the ones, boots on the ground, doing the work every day in the classrooms.

767
01:19:41,897 --> 01:19:45,418
[SPEAKER_06]: So there definitely is something happening that's very good.

768
01:19:45,878 --> 01:19:47,718
[SPEAKER_06]: So the instructional core is there.

769
01:19:47,959 --> 01:19:49,039
[SPEAKER_06]: There's evidence of that.

770
01:19:49,479 --> 01:19:50,259
[SPEAKER_06]: And the leadership

771
01:19:51,044 --> 01:19:54,426
[SPEAKER_06]: that is helping to maintain the instructional core that's in place.

772
01:19:54,986 --> 01:20:04,730
[SPEAKER_06]: So the instructional leaders of the school and the instructional leadership of Superintendent Belson, helping to move the school forward and not backwards.

773
01:20:05,851 --> 01:20:06,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

774
01:20:07,171 --> 01:20:07,572
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

775
01:20:07,812 --> 01:20:15,875
[SPEAKER_11]: Dr. Edward Vincent, Sebastian Tringali, one of our seniors, has joined us just now, as well as Justin you met during interviews, Justin Tseng.

776
01:20:16,796 --> 01:20:18,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

777
01:20:20,526 --> 01:20:21,346
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait a minute.

778
01:20:21,746 --> 01:20:22,527
[SPEAKER_10]: Tufts and Harvard.

779
01:20:23,247 --> 01:20:24,307
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you're going to Harvard and Tufts.

780
01:20:24,327 --> 01:20:25,527
[SPEAKER_10]: Congratulations.

781
01:20:25,607 --> 01:20:26,468
[SPEAKER_10]: Congratulations.

782
01:20:26,548 --> 01:20:27,248
[SPEAKER_11]: Underachievers.

783
01:20:28,328 --> 01:20:29,409
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, overachievers.

784
01:20:30,029 --> 01:20:30,729
[SPEAKER_11]: Fantastic.

785
01:20:30,769 --> 01:20:34,370
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if either of you have a question if you wanted to pop in, or do you want to wait a little bit?

786
01:20:34,410 --> 01:20:34,890
[SPEAKER_11]: It's up to you.

787
01:20:34,910 --> 01:20:37,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you tell him the answer?

788
01:20:37,371 --> 01:20:37,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

789
01:20:37,651 --> 01:20:37,711
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

790
01:20:41,508 --> 01:20:44,291
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful.

791
01:20:44,331 --> 01:20:44,652
[SPEAKER_01]: Justin?

792
01:20:44,692 --> 01:20:46,954
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you ask both questions?

793
01:20:47,315 --> 01:20:47,435
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

794
01:20:48,136 --> 01:20:49,137
[SPEAKER_01]: I've not asked yours yet.

795
01:20:50,879 --> 01:20:53,822
[SPEAKER_01]: Mine was the first one or the second one?

796
01:20:53,962 --> 01:20:55,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Civic engagement was asked.

797
01:20:58,286 --> 01:21:05,792
[SPEAKER_01]: As you may know, the foreign language program at the high school has gone through many changes in the last decade.

798
01:21:06,173 --> 01:21:12,779
[SPEAKER_01]: We've gone from a 5 out of 6 day cycle to making it a full core class 6 out of 6 days.

799
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:27,546
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of this is in response to people saying that the foreign language department isn't treated as equally with different departments and given the same attention, especially in a globalizing world.

800
01:21:29,127 --> 01:21:36,611
[SPEAKER_01]: So we focused on the high school, but what do you think we can do as a district at the elementary and middle school levels?

801
01:21:39,136 --> 01:21:45,119
[SPEAKER_06]: So when I was a principal, we were teaching Japanese.

802
01:21:47,161 --> 01:21:55,045
[SPEAKER_06]: It was being taught in the advanced work classes, so at fourth and fifth grade, students were receiving Japanese as a supplemental

803
01:21:56,134 --> 01:22:02,677
[SPEAKER_06]: enrichment, I do believe that we can bring language, a foreign language, down to the elementary level.

804
01:22:03,578 --> 01:22:04,998
[SPEAKER_06]: No questions about that.

805
01:22:05,178 --> 01:22:11,501
[SPEAKER_06]: I think in order for us to be able to compete globally, we're going to need to be bilingual.

806
01:22:11,801 --> 01:22:24,367
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to need students who speak Spanish, Mandarin, these are the global, I mean, even though some are learning Cantonese, but I would say Spanish,

807
01:22:25,757 --> 01:22:37,705
[SPEAKER_06]: Mandarin, Arabic, if you're going to be working with countries in the Middle East, and not wanting to limit students' potentials.

808
01:22:37,826 --> 01:22:45,311
[SPEAKER_06]: We have other languages, of course, the Romance languages, French and Portuguese and Italian and Greek.

809
01:22:46,211 --> 01:22:48,773
[SPEAKER_06]: We have many other languages that do exist, but you,

810
01:22:50,334 --> 01:23:03,597
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel in order for students to be able to be competitive, they will need to be able to have an additional language that you are able to communicate in and be able to compete globally.

811
01:23:04,177 --> 01:23:05,317
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't want to be left out.

812
01:23:05,518 --> 01:23:06,838
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't want to be left behind.

813
01:23:07,598 --> 01:23:11,519
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is one of the ways in which it can happen.

814
01:23:12,199 --> 01:23:13,961
[SPEAKER_06]: and to do it with intentionality.

815
01:23:14,581 --> 01:23:24,051
[SPEAKER_06]: I also have in my portfolio of schools, I have a level one dual language school and that's the Hurley School and they are doing it.

816
01:23:24,231 --> 01:23:27,314
[SPEAKER_06]: It's two weeks on off and the students are learning.

817
01:23:27,794 --> 01:23:42,961
[SPEAKER_06]: in both English and Spanish, so when they reach eighth grade, the majority of the students are fully bilingual in both English and in Spanish, and biliterate, and many of them transition on to our dual-language high school.

818
01:23:43,541 --> 01:23:53,146
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of them do not transition to a dual-language high school, and they decide to go to a traditional high school, but when they leave, they have up to eighth-grade literacy,

819
01:23:54,929 --> 01:23:57,371
[SPEAKER_06]: fluency to be able to read and write in another language.

820
01:23:57,411 --> 01:23:58,471
[SPEAKER_06]: So it can happen.

821
01:23:58,491 --> 01:24:00,132
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm seeing it happen now.

822
01:24:00,913 --> 01:24:02,634
[SPEAKER_06]: And it allows you to compete.

823
01:24:04,355 --> 01:24:09,899
[SPEAKER_01]: Taking a step back from foreign language and looking at globalization with a larger lens.

824
01:24:11,336 --> 01:24:22,258
[SPEAKER_01]: Many Medford High and Medford Public Schools graduates move on to work in different countries or go to different countries to study, and many come from families of different countries, like you and me.

825
01:24:24,039 --> 01:24:30,760
[SPEAKER_01]: So how would you help Medford Public Schools be plugged into this wider international community?

826
01:24:32,340 --> 01:24:40,642
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would first start off by saying that I would say that every language and every culture is an asset

827
01:24:41,870 --> 01:24:57,787
[SPEAKER_06]: And we probably would need to spend time talking about differences and talking about acknowledging and respecting cultural and linguistic differences that exist just amongst Medford public schools.

828
01:25:00,570 --> 01:25:10,724
[SPEAKER_06]: Once we see the value in what every culture and language, the linguistic diversity that already exists here can offer, then we can build from that.

829
01:25:10,944 --> 01:25:16,291
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe that that also is a mindset that sometimes people feel like

830
01:25:17,361 --> 01:25:24,766
[SPEAKER_06]: Certain cultures or certain languages don't count or don't matter and so they don't feel like they need to learn from the other cultures.

831
01:25:25,286 --> 01:25:46,140
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think if you have a mindset where you can learn from others, you can learn something the same way we can teach something, that you can learn something valuable from another culture and be able to embrace that culture and find ways to celebrate our differences and engage the entire community in that process.

832
01:25:47,503 --> 01:25:47,783
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

833
01:25:48,784 --> 01:25:49,485
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Ruggiero.

834
01:25:51,646 --> 01:25:52,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Doctor.

835
01:25:52,267 --> 01:25:55,269
[SPEAKER_03]: I have some operational questions for you.

836
01:25:56,850 --> 01:26:02,575
[SPEAKER_03]: So first, I would like you to imagine that you have a vacancy in your sixth grade for a sixth grade teacher.

837
01:26:04,076 --> 01:26:17,046
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like you to walk us through your process of how you would acquire a nice set of resumes, what you would look for in those resumes, and ultimately, how you would interview them and then select one of the candidates.

838
01:26:18,399 --> 01:26:24,542
[SPEAKER_06]: So with this sixth grade vacancy, am I talking from a principal lens or from the superintendent lens?

839
01:26:25,602 --> 01:26:26,123
[SPEAKER_06]: Superintendent.

840
01:26:26,283 --> 01:26:27,263
[SPEAKER_06]: The superintendent lens.

841
01:26:27,703 --> 01:26:31,685
[SPEAKER_06]: So with, and I'm only asking for that, just for the context.

842
01:26:32,105 --> 01:26:37,007
[SPEAKER_06]: So with the vacancy, sometimes we have

843
01:26:38,914 --> 01:26:42,137
[SPEAKER_06]: sometimes we overlook what's already amongst us.

844
01:26:42,937 --> 01:26:52,985
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would first start with the teachers and speaking with the teachers to say, we have the sixth grade vacancy.

845
01:26:53,065 --> 01:27:00,931
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be my first pass to say, we're going to be posting this position.

846
01:27:01,712 --> 01:27:06,916
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to be looking for diverse candidates to come into our sixth grade.

847
01:27:07,639 --> 01:27:09,220
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you know of people who are looking?

848
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:15,244
[SPEAKER_06]: So I always start with kind of my first immediate circle, just to start getting resumes coming forward.

849
01:27:16,464 --> 01:27:24,189
[SPEAKER_06]: And sometimes when you start within your immediate circle, you can find out about interest, even if it's someone at a different grade level.

850
01:27:24,609 --> 01:27:33,575
[SPEAKER_06]: It could potentially be someone who's a specialist, who is a licensed teacher, who was also looking for an opportunity to transition into a sixth grade

851
01:27:33,973 --> 01:27:54,502
[SPEAKER_06]: vacancy, which would create a vacancy in the special, I understand that, but if you're looking at the sixth grade content teacher where a set of students are not receiving content instruction, I would prefer to not have a substitute for all day instruction as opposed to if it's a content where every 45 minutes

852
01:27:55,911 --> 01:28:01,076
[SPEAKER_06]: it's, or 48 minutes, it's a new person coming into the classroom.

853
01:28:01,416 --> 01:28:02,397
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would start there.

854
01:28:02,797 --> 01:28:05,599
[SPEAKER_06]: I would also talk with the colleges and universities.

855
01:28:06,160 --> 01:28:14,927
[SPEAKER_06]: I went to Wheelock undergrad, Wheelock, Lesley, reach out Tufts, reach out to the local schools and say we have an immediate vacancy.

856
01:28:15,328 --> 01:28:16,469
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's on your short list?

857
01:28:17,029 --> 01:28:18,751
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's a strong candidate on your short list?

858
01:28:19,611 --> 01:28:21,813
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would, so I would network.

859
01:28:23,186 --> 01:28:27,100
[SPEAKER_06]: speak with the teachers, and then bring the candidates in.

860
01:28:30,686 --> 01:28:39,368
[SPEAKER_06]: So depending on the school, we've done performatives where we have candidates who are interested in coming to teach at a school.

861
01:28:39,808 --> 01:28:43,109
[SPEAKER_06]: We ask them to come and do a demonstration lesson.

862
01:28:44,009 --> 01:28:47,030
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we speak with their administrator.

863
01:28:47,070 --> 01:28:49,371
[SPEAKER_06]: We set up a time and we actually have them teach.

864
01:28:49,911 --> 01:28:52,652
[SPEAKER_06]: I just did this a week and a half ago at one of my schools.

865
01:28:52,692 --> 01:28:54,032
[SPEAKER_06]: I was in an early childhood classroom.

866
01:28:54,773 --> 01:29:09,478
[SPEAKER_06]: and they had a teacher come and do a demonstration read aloud, picture walk with the students, and there were six of us in the classroom observing, and there were three teachers, early childhood teachers from the school also observing.

867
01:29:10,418 --> 01:29:21,742
[SPEAKER_06]: And we used a rubric, and we were looking to see, looking for evidence of what the teacher was doing, what teacher moves, how was she interacting with the students, she was singing,

868
01:29:22,287 --> 01:29:24,149
[SPEAKER_06]: She, you know, what was the tone of her voice?

869
01:29:24,570 --> 01:29:25,992
[SPEAKER_06]: How did the students respond to her?

870
01:29:26,673 --> 01:29:29,677
[SPEAKER_06]: Was her lesson cognitively demanding for those children?

871
01:29:29,797 --> 01:29:30,598
[SPEAKER_06]: Were they challenged?

872
01:29:30,638 --> 01:29:31,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Were they engaged?

873
01:29:32,240 --> 01:29:34,863
[SPEAKER_06]: And so she did a 20-minute demonstration lesson.

874
01:29:38,843 --> 01:29:45,727
[SPEAKER_06]: Based on that demonstration lesson, we debriefed with the teacher afterwards and said that we would follow up and get in touch with her.

875
01:29:46,248 --> 01:30:03,939
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's one of the strategies where you can have the person come and perform for you or we've also traveled to the school to see the teacher in action with their current students because their students are accustomed to them and moving them to go to another school.

876
01:30:04,419 --> 01:30:07,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes the children aren't sure how to interact.

877
01:30:07,617 --> 01:30:08,477
[SPEAKER_06]: That's another way.

878
01:30:08,577 --> 01:30:25,005
[SPEAKER_06]: So I believe, I mean, granted if it's not in Hartford that the person is teaching, then if it was local, I would definitely be willing to go and look at the instruction to make sure that we're bringing on a highly qualified teacher who's able to produce.

879
01:30:25,945 --> 01:30:26,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

880
01:30:26,925 --> 01:30:35,369
[SPEAKER_03]: My next question involves, I would like you to assume you have a very talented and hardworking principal, but they have a particular set of teachers or maybe just one teacher.

881
01:30:35,933 --> 01:30:37,094
[SPEAKER_03]: that's not doing very well.

882
01:30:37,514 --> 01:30:39,255
[SPEAKER_03]: They fail a large number of their students.

883
01:30:40,016 --> 01:30:52,145
[SPEAKER_03]: How would you help that, after you've shown the data, you know, that this teacher still hasn't changed their style, how do you help that teacher move on to a more effective position, or when do you decide when to let go of a teacher?

884
01:30:53,046 --> 01:30:57,029
[SPEAKER_06]: So in my current role, I do support principals.

885
01:30:57,429 --> 01:30:58,770
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kind of called in

886
01:30:59,508 --> 01:31:12,959
[SPEAKER_06]: when there's a question, so I'm always looking at instruction and providing feedback, and I provide feedback to the teachers directly sometimes before I leave, or I'll give it to the principal and check in with them next time I'm there.

887
01:31:13,560 --> 01:31:22,988
[SPEAKER_06]: I also support teachers that are underperforming, and if principals have a question, they'll say, I want you to come and see.

888
01:31:23,809 --> 01:31:28,251
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I've gone in to see whether their assessment is accurate or inaccurate.

889
01:31:29,032 --> 01:31:43,459
[SPEAKER_06]: And usually, if it's an underperforming teacher, it's seriously underperforming, where it's, you know, we have coaches, we have peer assistants, and so we have a lot of kind of progressive measures of support.

890
01:31:43,779 --> 01:31:51,663
[SPEAKER_06]: So if teachers need help, they have peer assistants, people who can come in and help them side by side teach, side by side coach.

891
01:31:53,160 --> 01:31:58,181
[SPEAKER_06]: And if that still isn't working, then we have to use the evaluation tool.

892
01:31:59,182 --> 01:32:11,205
[SPEAKER_06]: But we meet, I debriefed with the principal and the teacher, giving them feedback on what we saw, feedback on what we want to see next time, and how we expect it to look.

893
01:32:12,005 --> 01:32:14,106
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I've done that as well.

894
01:32:15,506 --> 01:32:20,708
[SPEAKER_03]: And finally, community engagement is a critical part to a successful budget.

895
01:32:21,790 --> 01:32:28,612
[SPEAKER_03]: How would you work with the residents of Medford after your first draft is created for your budget?

896
01:32:29,012 --> 01:32:34,054
[SPEAKER_03]: How would you help sort of get the people of Medford on board with it and how would you integrate their criticisms?

897
01:32:38,455 --> 01:32:49,578
[SPEAKER_06]: So as part of my entry plan where I would be out within the community dealing with all stakeholders, I would hope before the budget process actually takes place in the fall

898
01:32:51,113 --> 01:33:13,419
[SPEAKER_06]: probably by November, start having budget conversations and doing a survey or getting feedback from the stakeholders and the constituents to see what is it they would like to see happen with the money.

899
01:33:13,779 --> 01:33:14,919
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a limited pool of money.

900
01:33:16,155 --> 01:33:20,038
[SPEAKER_06]: and you have to wait until you get your official disbursement.

901
01:33:20,078 --> 01:33:29,884
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can have an idea and you can have your first original budget, but you don't know if it's gonna go up a little or if it's gonna go down a little.

902
01:33:29,924 --> 01:33:31,925
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gonna go down.

903
01:33:32,005 --> 01:33:44,994
[SPEAKER_06]: And so with that, and a lot of times, in my context, Boston, the mayor has helped to supplement and kind of close the gap

904
01:33:45,555 --> 01:33:49,257
[SPEAKER_06]: when it's a specific need and maybe the money isn't there.

905
01:33:49,978 --> 01:33:51,939
[SPEAKER_06]: So you need to have a tight plan in place.

906
01:33:52,079 --> 01:33:52,859
[SPEAKER_06]: What is the plan?

907
01:33:54,180 --> 01:33:57,962
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it a sound plan, reasonable plan, logical plan?

908
01:33:58,722 --> 01:34:02,244
[SPEAKER_06]: And then look at that plan and look at what the money is that's available.

909
01:34:02,504 --> 01:34:03,545
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you have available?

910
01:34:04,105 --> 01:34:05,626
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you have to work from there.

911
01:34:06,026 --> 01:34:07,047
[SPEAKER_06]: So I could want

912
01:34:07,782 --> 01:34:11,044
[SPEAKER_06]: the sky, the sun, and the moon.

913
01:34:11,064 --> 01:34:16,246
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm only able to acquire a flower.

914
01:34:17,707 --> 01:34:19,888
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have to be reasonable.

915
01:34:19,948 --> 01:34:21,068
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to balance the budget.

916
01:34:21,188 --> 01:34:25,450
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not like you have a credit card and you can say, I'm going to put it on credit.

917
01:34:26,151 --> 01:34:28,332
[SPEAKER_06]: So we can dream big.

918
01:34:28,412 --> 01:34:31,653
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's great to know what people's dreams are and what their expectations are.

919
01:34:32,434 --> 01:34:36,896
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's good to just have all the voices create an opportunity.

920
01:34:37,267 --> 01:34:40,248
[SPEAKER_06]: for the voices of all stakeholders to be heard.

921
01:34:40,828 --> 01:34:48,831
[SPEAKER_06]: But then, when you actually have the budget, to look at what's reasonable and will position Medford for the next phase of the work.

922
01:34:49,072 --> 01:34:49,692
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

923
01:34:49,892 --> 01:34:50,312
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

924
01:34:50,772 --> 01:34:52,193
[SPEAKER_11]: We have our final question from Ms.

925
01:34:52,213 --> 01:34:52,813
[SPEAKER_11]: Van der Kloot.

926
01:34:53,313 --> 01:34:55,374
[SPEAKER_07]: A couple of them, but they're short.

927
01:34:56,554 --> 01:34:58,035
[SPEAKER_07]: So just budget.

928
01:34:58,175 --> 01:35:05,738
[SPEAKER_07]: When you did your superintendent training, did you have experience with a particular budget in a particular community during that training?

929
01:35:07,173 --> 01:35:11,314
[SPEAKER_06]: So meeting, going to a community meeting about the budget, are you saying?

930
01:35:11,334 --> 01:35:17,496
[SPEAKER_07]: No, just, I didn't know if you worked with a particular mentor in a particular community that did budget with you.

931
01:35:17,516 --> 01:35:18,236
[SPEAKER_07]: I just didn't know.

932
01:35:18,256 --> 01:35:26,158
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have, from a budget perspective, I actually have a designated budget liaison who, so I have a

933
01:35:27,610 --> 01:35:30,033
[SPEAKER_06]: a budget analyst who works with me.

934
01:35:30,454 --> 01:35:39,204
[SPEAKER_07]: Not during your time in Boston, but when you did your superintendent training classes, did you work with a mentor outside of Boston at all?

935
01:35:42,007 --> 01:35:42,768
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

936
01:35:43,228 --> 01:35:45,210
[SPEAKER_06]: I've had my superintendent license for a while.

937
01:35:45,310 --> 01:35:46,271
[SPEAKER_06]: I did not work with

938
01:35:46,852 --> 01:35:48,232
[SPEAKER_06]: people outside of Boston.

939
01:35:48,252 --> 01:35:55,374
[SPEAKER_06]: When I was at Boston College, it was Professor Lynch who did the budgeting coursework.

940
01:35:55,534 --> 01:35:56,554
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

941
01:35:57,234 --> 01:36:04,076
[SPEAKER_07]: Next question is, if you could go to the Board of Education tomorrow and advocate for change, what would you be talking about?

942
01:36:07,997 --> 01:36:14,658
[SPEAKER_06]: If I could go to the board tomorrow, I would be talking about if there was ever a possibility, if I was allowed to dream,

943
01:36:16,420 --> 01:36:35,564
[SPEAKER_06]: that as we look at the accountability structure, the current accountability structure that's in place, it's in place but it's based on a test that students take in ELA, two sessions out of 180 days of school and two days of math out of 180 days of school.

944
01:36:36,064 --> 01:36:39,345
[SPEAKER_06]: And I almost wish that there was a way in which we could balance

945
01:36:40,572 --> 01:36:51,756
[SPEAKER_06]: that I believe in accountability, but that it did not have to be the end all and be all to designate an entire school the work that they've done for that entirety.

946
01:36:52,496 --> 01:37:04,980
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know there has to be a standard, but I wish that was something that I could, you know, speak to the department about and say, could there be other measures that we use to assess schools?

947
01:37:05,741 --> 01:37:07,281
[SPEAKER_07]: So what other measures would you like to use?

948
01:37:07,941 --> 01:37:09,362
[SPEAKER_06]: I would love to be able to use

949
01:37:10,397 --> 01:37:19,243
[SPEAKER_06]: non-tangible measures like the culture and the climate, the environment, the engagement, the instruction that's happening in the schools, the populations.

950
01:37:19,303 --> 01:37:34,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Although we look at the subgroups and how the subgroups perform, but being able to, you know, if you have a school that has a high ELL population or a high students with disabilities population, they may be taking the MCAS ALT.

951
01:37:35,012 --> 01:37:37,474
[SPEAKER_06]: So their performance is always going to look

952
01:37:37,987 --> 01:37:44,933
[SPEAKER_06]: like they're not learning anything or they're not progressing at the rate, the same rate as everyone else is progressing.

953
01:37:45,394 --> 01:37:54,081
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you look at the individual needs of that school, you would see that they are progressing and they're progressing at an alternative rate.

954
01:37:54,102 --> 01:38:02,329
[SPEAKER_06]: So I wish that the accountability system was not the only way, the only measure that was used.

955
01:38:03,001 --> 01:38:04,081
[SPEAKER_06]: to assess the school.

956
01:38:04,281 --> 01:38:05,322
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thank you very much.

957
01:38:05,362 --> 01:38:07,783
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd ask you more, but I know I'll get in trouble.

958
01:38:08,083 --> 01:38:10,223
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, thank you so much for being here this evening.

959
01:38:10,383 --> 01:38:15,005
[SPEAKER_11]: We'd like to just, if you'd like to make some closing statements at this time, you're more than willing to.

960
01:38:15,705 --> 01:38:19,766
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just want to say thank you to all of you, the school committee members.

961
01:38:20,087 --> 01:38:24,368
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to say again that I consider this truly an honor and privilege

962
01:38:24,793 --> 01:38:49,527
[SPEAKER_06]: to come back to Medford, home for me, and to take all my experience of being, different experience of teaching and being a principal and being a superintendent at the, network superintendent and instructional superintendent, and bring all of the skills that I've learned back to Medford, that would be, you know, a great honor for me.

963
01:38:49,768 --> 01:38:52,189
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just wanna say thank you again for this opportunity.

964
01:38:52,289 --> 01:38:52,709
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

965
01:38:52,989 --> 01:38:53,690
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

966
01:39:13,063 --> 01:39:13,243
Thank you.

967
01:39:42,824 --> 01:39:42,904
Yeah.

968
01:42:55,111 --> 01:42:55,172
you

969
01:43:59,332 --> 01:43:59,656
you

970
01:47:59,284 --> 01:48:00,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Very dangerous.

971
01:48:25,350 --> 01:48:26,350
Introduce you?

972
01:48:26,410 --> 01:48:29,531
Do you want to walk through?

973
01:49:18,756 --> 01:49:21,580
[SPEAKER_11]: We have with us Mr. Thomas Martelone.

974
01:49:22,561 --> 01:49:25,325
[SPEAKER_11]: At this time I'd like if you'd like to make some opening statements.

975
01:49:25,925 --> 01:49:26,206
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

976
01:49:26,286 --> 01:49:26,867
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.

977
01:49:28,748 --> 01:49:34,551
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to thank you for having me back, and I hope you're all doing well, and I look forward to answering your questions this evening.

978
01:49:35,092 --> 01:49:39,535
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would indulge me for a moment or two, I did prepare some remarks, because I do like to be prepared.

979
01:49:40,275 --> 01:49:43,117
[SPEAKER_00]: They're slightly longer than I might normally give, but they're still brief.

980
01:49:45,379 --> 01:49:47,180
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think will give you some insights into my work.

981
01:49:48,461 --> 01:49:56,126
[SPEAKER_00]: In order, I believe, in order for a school system to be successful, a superintendent needs to keep all of the trains running on time.

982
01:49:57,098 --> 01:49:59,159
[SPEAKER_00]: 24-7 and 365 days a year.

983
01:50:00,580 --> 01:50:09,104
[SPEAKER_00]: It requires knowing what's important, setting priorities, and being able to get students, teachers, and parents what they need and when they need it.

984
01:50:10,464 --> 01:50:19,168
[SPEAKER_00]: And throughout my career, I would share with you that I feel I've demonstrated that consistently, and that I possess the management skills that will get the job done.

985
01:50:20,249 --> 01:50:24,311
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would share with you that I've consistently executed my duties in the interest of the public.

986
01:50:25,589 --> 01:50:31,610
[SPEAKER_00]: And apart from my ability to get things done, I've also demonstrated my leadership ability.

987
01:50:32,051 --> 01:50:34,371
[SPEAKER_00]: And leadership does require a different skill set.

988
01:50:35,371 --> 01:50:43,673
[SPEAKER_00]: And a superintendent needs to be the district's lead learner, their lead listener, and their lead communicator.

989
01:50:44,393 --> 01:50:46,514
[SPEAKER_00]: And they do that for the school system in which they work.

990
01:50:48,274 --> 01:50:54,536
[SPEAKER_00]: As a district's lead learner, or rather a lead listener, I will listen actively.

991
01:50:55,475 --> 01:50:59,978
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll listen for understanding, and I'll listen empathetically and with compassion.

992
01:51:01,779 --> 01:51:10,165
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm open to soliciting input, and I respect differences of opinion, and I'll always seek common ground and consensus within the school community.

993
01:51:13,294 --> 01:51:24,283
[SPEAKER_00]: My hope is that I will provide staff, students, and parents with multiple forums for participation, and will myself participate in numerous school and community events.

994
01:51:25,324 --> 01:51:35,631
[SPEAKER_00]: My hope would be that I will create opportunities that foster community, and under my leadership, that the operations of the Medford Public Schools would be transparent and that the community would have a voice.

995
01:51:38,614 --> 01:51:40,355
[SPEAKER_00]: In regards to being a lead communicator,

996
01:51:41,347 --> 01:51:45,730
[SPEAKER_00]: As a superintendent of schools, you can never over-communicate with the public.

997
01:51:46,891 --> 01:51:53,736
[SPEAKER_00]: Strategic and targeted and frequent communications with the community is crucial for the success of a school system.

998
01:51:55,738 --> 01:52:04,524
[SPEAKER_00]: I would use multiple forums for communication, social media, monthly newsletters, superintendent roundtable forums,

999
01:52:05,490 --> 01:52:17,254
[SPEAKER_00]: and use other media, such as the educational television channel you have, and district website, and tools such as blogs and podcasts to share information with families and the community at large.

1000
01:52:18,774 --> 01:52:30,898
[SPEAKER_00]: I would promote and support ongoing two-way communication with parents at all levels of the school district, and I would also use feedback surveys to gauge how well we as a district are communicating with the community.

1001
01:52:32,679 --> 01:52:39,123
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, as we all know, learning organizations must embrace growth and learning.

1002
01:52:39,403 --> 01:52:48,368
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the lead learner of the district, I would strategically align professional development opportunities with strategic plans, as well as district goals.

1003
01:52:49,048 --> 01:52:55,572
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would ensure that funds are dedicated to support research-based professional learning opportunities for students, staff, and parents.

1004
01:52:57,178 --> 01:53:07,706
[SPEAKER_00]: I do believe in the power of using robust curriculum review processes to ensure that kids are engaged in relevant, thoughtful, and rigorous curriculum that prepares them for success in post-secondary lives.

1005
01:53:07,746 --> 01:53:08,707
[SPEAKER_00]: That's extremely important.

1006
01:53:09,768 --> 01:53:17,193
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would collaborate with all educators and parents to provide those opportunities for students that need extra support or extensions to their learning.

1007
01:53:18,174 --> 01:53:20,896
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would model being a lead learner for the district.

1008
01:53:22,337 --> 01:53:23,037
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

1009
01:53:23,318 --> 01:53:24,418
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.

1010
01:53:24,458 --> 01:53:24,999
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Ruggiero.

1011
01:53:28,777 --> 01:53:29,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, good evening.

1012
01:53:30,840 --> 01:53:35,906
[SPEAKER_03]: On your resume, you listed data-informed decision-making as one of your core competencies.

1013
01:53:37,308 --> 01:53:46,620
[SPEAKER_03]: With some of the flaws and the issues with the MCAS and any data set, I wonder how do you separate the signal from the noise when you evaluate student performance?

1014
01:53:49,491 --> 01:53:58,075
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess if I needed to go back and actually revisit my resume, I might say student-driven rather than data-driven.

1015
01:53:58,735 --> 01:54:00,556
[SPEAKER_00]: Data is always a number, and it's a point.

1016
01:54:01,136 --> 01:54:08,080
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's really important to, one, keep in mind that behind every data point is a student, and the data is a beginning story.

1017
01:54:08,700 --> 01:54:10,141
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a beginning story about a student.

1018
01:54:10,701 --> 01:54:14,803
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a beginning story about a school, and it's a beginning story about a district.

1019
01:54:15,800 --> 01:54:23,303
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think sometimes people are very quick to look at data and maybe make a judgment or rush to try to come up with a solution.

1020
01:54:24,204 --> 01:54:39,391
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I often do is use data as a starting point for asking questions and trying to find out more about whatever the root of the data is from, whether it's MCAS, whether it's parent feedback, it comes in multiple ways.

1021
01:54:39,451 --> 01:54:40,611
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we,

1022
01:54:42,512 --> 01:54:43,573
[SPEAKER_00]: based on accountability.

1023
01:54:44,134 --> 01:54:51,342
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, MCAS, it's a very public test, and I think the public is very in tune to what school results look like when they're published.

1024
01:54:52,083 --> 01:54:53,825
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think sometimes those results

1025
01:54:55,732 --> 01:54:57,753
[SPEAKER_00]: may not always paint a full picture of a school.

1026
01:54:58,373 --> 01:55:08,416
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the other thing is, is that if you were to think of a comprehensive assessment system in a school district, MCAS is about 10% of that entire comprehensive assessment system.

1027
01:55:08,476 --> 01:55:11,917
[SPEAKER_00]: So what other data do you have that shows student performance?

1028
01:55:12,877 --> 01:55:24,100
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, tests such as MCAS, while they do provide valuable feedback, I think you need to keep in mind what the intent is, and that's around accountability, making sure that schools are providing for all students.

1029
01:55:25,270 --> 01:55:32,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Mentioning accountability, I was curious, how do you go about evaluating teachers in this regard?

1030
01:55:32,990 --> 01:55:36,731
[SPEAKER_03]: As you look over student performance, you put your picture together, which involves some data.

1031
01:55:36,871 --> 01:55:38,731
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you look over teacher performance?

1032
01:55:39,351 --> 01:55:39,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

1033
01:55:40,612 --> 01:55:48,193
[SPEAKER_00]: As you know, the state did head down a path, if you will, where student performance was intended to be tied to teacher evaluation.

1034
01:55:49,173 --> 01:55:52,334
[SPEAKER_00]: We had, in the works, district-determined measures.

1035
01:55:52,914 --> 01:55:55,075
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also, they were looking at growth.

1036
01:55:56,975 --> 01:56:00,556
[SPEAKER_00]: The key thing that I look for in regards to data

1037
01:56:02,396 --> 01:56:05,719
[SPEAKER_00]: is one, I'll look at the composition of the class.

1038
01:56:05,919 --> 01:56:20,371
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also oftentimes looking for student growth because if you're a teacher with 20 students and you have three students on IEPs and perhaps those students may have significant disabilities, the goal is always to help them reach a high standard and make growth.

1039
01:56:20,651 --> 01:56:22,953
[SPEAKER_00]: Their growth may look different than those of other students.

1040
01:56:23,513 --> 01:56:28,958
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think what happens is I always use evaluation as a tool

1041
01:56:29,819 --> 01:56:33,821
[SPEAKER_00]: to start a conversation around professional improvement in meeting the needs of kids.

1042
01:56:34,462 --> 01:56:44,469
[SPEAKER_00]: So the teacher evaluation system is created in mind with a professional learning goal where educators are looking to improve their practice.

1043
01:56:45,230 --> 01:56:48,632
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the evaluation system also includes a student learning goal.

1044
01:56:49,113 --> 01:56:50,874
[SPEAKER_00]: And that student learning goal is focused on data.

1045
01:56:51,154 --> 01:56:57,559
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my experience, what happens is generally in the fall, I've worked with teachers to provide them a data set

1046
01:56:57,921 --> 01:57:01,102
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually that data set is from the end of the previous school year.

1047
01:57:01,853 --> 01:57:04,834
[SPEAKER_00]: And if possible, some data from the beginning of the school year, if we have that.

1048
01:57:05,994 --> 01:57:12,695
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually set very measurable goals, because goals need to be attained, if possible.

1049
01:57:12,715 --> 01:57:14,275
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're working to reach those goals.

1050
01:57:14,875 --> 01:57:19,616
[SPEAKER_00]: The other piece is that the teachers are working to create those goals based on the students in front of them.

1051
01:57:20,156 --> 01:57:26,458
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that's part of those goals, and the student performance is part of the teacher evaluation.

1052
01:57:26,478 --> 01:57:28,218
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not the sum of that.

1053
01:57:29,591 --> 01:57:43,085
[SPEAKER_03]: And finally, when you look over the data information about teachers and students, what do you think is the hardest or the hardest field of goals for your students to achieve moving forward?

1054
01:57:43,706 --> 01:57:45,288
[SPEAKER_00]: The hardest goals for students to achieve?

1055
01:57:48,413 --> 01:57:53,675
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, well, I guess I would say one of the most important things is to set realistic goals for students.

1056
01:57:54,375 --> 01:57:59,457
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you're looking at students, the very best teachers really know their students well.

1057
01:58:00,357 --> 01:58:07,720
[SPEAKER_00]: They know them as, if you will, academically, and then I think they know them socially and emotionally as well as people.

1058
01:58:08,300 --> 01:58:11,061
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't educate half kids, we educate whole children.

1059
01:58:11,701 --> 01:58:31,442
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think really skilled teachers, I think skilled educators, whether it be a principal or a superintendent, curriculum people, are always thinking about the needs of kids and how we're working to either personalize or tailor instruction and to figure out how to move kids along our trajectory to meet standards.

1060
01:58:31,923 --> 01:58:32,744
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeping that in mind,

1061
01:58:33,304 --> 01:58:36,606
[SPEAKER_00]: not every child reaches the standards at the same time.

1062
01:58:37,186 --> 01:58:39,668
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're always looking for that growth for kids.

1063
01:58:40,728 --> 01:58:49,913
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess what I would say is, for me, when I'm thinking about student performance, my greatest concern would be if I have children who aren't making growth.

1064
01:58:50,093 --> 01:58:57,317
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I think there's a question there, and we're looking at what we might do as a school or a district to perhaps stimulate growth for them.

1065
01:58:58,097 --> 01:58:58,418
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1066
01:58:58,618 --> 01:58:58,958
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.

1067
01:59:01,186 --> 01:59:01,546
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1068
01:59:01,686 --> 01:59:02,427
[SPEAKER_12]: Nice to meet you.

1069
01:59:02,527 --> 01:59:03,668
[SPEAKER_00]: Very nice to meet you.

1070
01:59:04,288 --> 01:59:10,733
[SPEAKER_12]: Could you just elaborate on some of your experience with collective bargaining and large scale budget development?

1071
01:59:11,354 --> 01:59:11,554
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

1072
01:59:13,696 --> 01:59:15,437
[SPEAKER_00]: So most recently,

1073
01:59:16,553 --> 01:59:21,016
[SPEAKER_00]: In my work in Lexington, I've been part of a couple teams in negotiations.

1074
01:59:22,256 --> 01:59:27,379
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked with a group to negotiate a support staff contract.

1075
01:59:28,099 --> 01:59:35,783
[SPEAKER_00]: That was our unit C. So I was involved in looking at the current contract and working as part of an in-district team where we

1076
01:59:36,724 --> 01:59:53,219
[SPEAKER_00]: where we looked at the contract, we looked at areas of the contract perhaps that we thought might need to be revisited in negotiations and we looked at it, I will say, I feel like we have good relations with the union and we looked at that contract both as what folks would need

1077
01:59:53,860 --> 01:59:54,780
[SPEAKER_00]: and what the district needed.

1078
01:59:55,020 --> 01:59:57,541
[SPEAKER_00]: So I felt like we didn't just look at it on the district side.

1079
01:59:58,401 --> 02:00:01,882
[SPEAKER_00]: Really great contracts, I will share with you, also keep students in mind.

1080
02:00:03,043 --> 02:00:04,943
[SPEAKER_00]: That should be a focus.

1081
02:00:04,983 --> 02:00:06,363
[SPEAKER_00]: So my focus is always on kids.

1082
02:00:07,004 --> 02:00:10,105
[SPEAKER_00]: What will a contract, what will the impact have on students?

1083
02:00:10,605 --> 02:00:11,145
[SPEAKER_00]: That's important.

1084
02:00:12,545 --> 02:00:14,866
[SPEAKER_00]: I participated in other negotiations where

1085
02:00:15,922 --> 02:00:19,083
[SPEAKER_00]: The superintendent felt as though I had a skill set around scheduling.

1086
02:00:19,923 --> 02:00:28,386
[SPEAKER_00]: So our district was looking at implementing a world language program and we were looking at what the impact would be across the system, across sets of elementary schools.

1087
02:00:28,426 --> 02:00:36,408
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was brought in as part of a bargaining team because of a skill set I had in creating schedules and what that would look like and what the impact would be across the district.

1088
02:00:37,608 --> 02:00:51,099
[SPEAKER_00]: In years prior, I've also been part of administrator negotiations where we oftentimes, not in Massachusetts, but where we bargained individually, but we may have had conversations about that contract.

1089
02:00:52,880 --> 02:01:01,988
[SPEAKER_00]: In regards to large-scale budget, if you will, I worked for a number of years in Maine, and part of my responsibilities in the district I worked in

1090
02:01:04,045 --> 02:01:07,587
[SPEAKER_00]: were to write district entitlement grants, Title I, Title II.

1091
02:01:08,247 --> 02:01:10,048
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wrote all of those grants for the district.

1092
02:01:10,128 --> 02:01:13,089
[SPEAKER_00]: I coordinated the district's Title I program, which was part of the budget.

1093
02:01:15,330 --> 02:01:22,714
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, I've had experiences at the district level where sometimes administrative input looked differently in regards to budgets.

1094
02:01:25,157 --> 02:01:43,029
[SPEAKER_00]: In my experience around budget development, which oftentimes I've been at the table with other administrators, the superintendent, other folks from the central office, I feel like some of the best practices are to have folks come forward with those things that either one are necessary due to enrollment,

1095
02:01:43,993 --> 02:01:47,656
[SPEAKER_00]: those things that are necessary due to legal mandates.

1096
02:01:48,737 --> 02:01:55,782
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also where people can bring things forward as part of a budget process that they're looking to maybe grow a program.

1097
02:01:56,102 --> 02:02:01,226
[SPEAKER_00]: Or sometimes they've investigated a program and they think maybe the program has changed and there's not a need for it.

1098
02:02:01,806 --> 02:02:08,531
[SPEAKER_00]: So really the budget process is around combing through needs and what are specific needs.

1099
02:02:09,091 --> 02:02:12,354
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to that, my work in developing budgets

1100
02:02:13,134 --> 02:02:29,127
[SPEAKER_00]: At the district level, when I've worked as part of this team, has always been to come in with what we think might be a reason, at least initially, where we think the budget might be and what the increase might be over the previous year, and then to be working back from that.

1101
02:02:29,627 --> 02:02:34,511
[SPEAKER_00]: So it involves forecasting for staff and what staffing needs are, enrollment.

1102
02:02:35,491 --> 02:02:40,916
[SPEAKER_00]: You're oftentimes looking at whether it's an unfunded mandate that the district will need to take on.

1103
02:02:42,016 --> 02:02:46,539
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you're looking at programs that are growing and you need to expand them.

1104
02:02:46,979 --> 02:02:57,305
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, you're really kind of, if you will, combing over and you're getting the input from all of your department head, stakeholders, administrators in going through that budget process.

1105
02:02:58,085 --> 02:03:00,487
[SPEAKER_00]: I've presented different facets of the budget.

1106
02:03:00,667 --> 02:03:05,069
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had to do that for school committees before as part of a team that worked on that.

1107
02:03:05,449 --> 02:03:07,311
[SPEAKER_00]: At the school level, I manage

1108
02:03:09,471 --> 02:03:24,915
[SPEAKER_00]: I manage the school-based budget and of course part of my responsibility is to ensure that the needs of students are met through the budget but then to also balance fiscal responsibilities to the town or in this case if I were superintendent would be the city.

1109
02:03:26,636 --> 02:03:27,656
[SPEAKER_12]: Great, thank you so much.

1110
02:03:28,036 --> 02:03:28,396
[SPEAKER_12]: You're welcome.

1111
02:03:28,416 --> 02:03:28,476
[SPEAKER_12]: Ms.

1112
02:03:28,516 --> 02:03:28,816
[SPEAKER_12]: Kritz?

1113
02:03:30,737 --> 02:03:31,677
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, hi Tom.

1114
02:03:33,044 --> 02:03:38,410
[SPEAKER_09]: So as you know, Medford Public Schools has 18 approved vocational CTE programs.

1115
02:03:38,950 --> 02:03:41,613
[SPEAKER_09]: How would you enhance the programs already in place?

1116
02:03:42,334 --> 02:03:46,178
[SPEAKER_09]: What is needed to remain on the cutting edge of technology?

1117
02:03:47,719 --> 02:03:50,622
[SPEAKER_09]: Where do you see the programs in three to five years?

1118
02:03:52,724 --> 02:03:53,565
[SPEAKER_09]: And I can repeat that.

1119
02:03:54,571 --> 02:03:55,451
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me make sure I've got it.

1120
02:03:55,491 --> 02:04:00,633
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'd want to know, in regards to the 18 programs, what I might do to enhance the programs.

1121
02:04:00,673 --> 02:04:01,894
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, already in place.

1122
02:04:02,974 --> 02:04:08,116
[SPEAKER_09]: And then secondly, what is needed to remain on the cutting edge of technology.

1123
02:04:12,938 --> 02:04:14,039
[SPEAKER_00]: And then three to five years out.

1124
02:04:14,279 --> 02:04:14,459
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1125
02:04:19,497 --> 02:04:26,031
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me just a second because I will tell you, I'm a researcher, so I've taken a lot of notes just in preparation for questions.

1126
02:04:37,512 --> 02:04:50,068
[SPEAKER_00]: So one, I did have the good fortune of, it was interesting, I watched, as I've been doing my research about your district, I watched the video that you have online regarding career and technical education.

1127
02:04:50,088 --> 02:04:54,214
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the things for me, first and foremost, I will just say,

1128
02:04:55,174 --> 02:05:01,758
[SPEAKER_00]: was around the level of engagement that was demonstrated by students, which says to me, kids are invested in that program.

1129
02:05:02,039 --> 02:05:08,803
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's really important that the kids are engaged and that they feel like the education that they're getting is relevant.

1130
02:05:09,023 --> 02:05:09,783
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one piece.

1131
02:05:12,136 --> 02:05:20,679
[SPEAKER_00]: So thinking about that, because I will tell you my kind of core belief is always what is best for kids, and I think about students and I place them first in my decision.

1132
02:05:20,759 --> 02:05:33,963
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I was thinking about enhancing the programs that are in place, one of the very first things I would do, and I think sometimes as educators we forget this because we get wrapped up in lots of other things,

1133
02:05:34,563 --> 02:05:38,227
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be talking to the students around their experience in the programs.

1134
02:05:39,148 --> 02:05:41,991
[SPEAKER_00]: One, I would ask them about their experience while they're currently there.

1135
02:05:43,233 --> 02:05:51,842
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing I might do is really talk to them as students are leaving the program and as they're going out into the workforce because I would want to know

1136
02:05:52,392 --> 02:05:59,274
[SPEAKER_00]: if the skill set that they've received really enabled them to leave our schools and be college and career ready.

1137
02:05:59,754 --> 02:06:01,815
[SPEAKER_00]: So were they able to go into a profession?

1138
02:06:01,875 --> 02:06:08,557
[SPEAKER_00]: Were they able to successfully get into a second year or a two-year or four-year school and be successful with that?

1139
02:06:09,157 --> 02:06:09,917
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one piece.

1140
02:06:12,202 --> 02:06:16,825
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, I don't know if Medford does this, many districts will do post-secondary surveys.

1141
02:06:16,865 --> 02:06:27,032
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're waiting for kids to be out in the workforce for a period of time, and they're reaching out to those graduates to say, please tell us, now that you've been out in the workforce, how are you?

1142
02:06:27,072 --> 02:06:32,015
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're looking kind of at the kids as you're leaving, and then you're also reaching out to them for those kids that have been out.

1143
02:06:33,634 --> 02:06:52,945
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in regards to cutting-edge technology, I don't know what the current involvement or practice is, but I did look through the website for the Association for Career and Technical Education, and I had a couple kind of glimmerings as I looked at that.

1144
02:06:53,125 --> 02:06:57,628
[SPEAKER_00]: So, one, I think they offer a lot of opportunities for people who are working in career and technical education.

1145
02:06:58,408 --> 02:07:01,390
[SPEAKER_00]: So I saw, for instance, on their website they had a best practices conference.

1146
02:07:01,911 --> 02:07:05,633
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would be wanting for our educators to attend that conference.

1147
02:07:08,255 --> 02:07:13,859
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing is I've been fortunate to work in districts where we've done curriculum reviews.

1148
02:07:14,519 --> 02:07:18,082
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would be hoping that about every two years,

1149
02:07:18,726 --> 02:07:25,928
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would be intensive, but I think based on the nature of the programs, you would need to be doing frequent reviews of the programs.

1150
02:07:26,548 --> 02:07:40,631
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you're reviewing those programs, you're also reaching out to, for instance, if you have a computer science program, which I know you do, you're reaching out to technical companies to be asking them, what are you looking for in the industry?

1151
02:07:41,151 --> 02:07:45,055
[SPEAKER_00]: and how does our program, and here's what we offer kids, how does that align?

1152
02:07:46,215 --> 02:07:51,940
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're looking at best practices, you're looking to see what the needs are in these companies.

1153
02:07:52,601 --> 02:08:09,375
[SPEAKER_00]: By doing a two-year review, what happens is, especially in technology or the computer field, things change so rapidly, I feel like maybe more rapidly, and this doesn't mean that things don't change, for instance, in cosmetology, but the nature of technology changes so rapidly,

1154
02:08:09,815 --> 02:08:14,399
[SPEAKER_00]: you really need to kind of be combing through those programs and what they're offering students.

1155
02:08:15,420 --> 02:08:23,247
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, I guess I would just say, as I was doing my research, I was reading a little bit, a piece online, and I don't remember where, but it was about job markets.

1156
02:08:23,988 --> 02:08:34,677
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have to be thinking that if we're having kids go through a career and technical program, and the job market outside of that experience is dictating something different,

1157
02:08:35,538 --> 02:08:42,901
[SPEAKER_00]: then do we need to look at maybe adding something new that's more relevant or improving what we have.

1158
02:08:44,442 --> 02:08:50,184
[SPEAKER_00]: And then three to five years, I mean, I shared with you, I would be doing those kind of, if you will, program reviews.

1159
02:08:51,344 --> 02:09:04,850
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be doing them about every two years, and I would probably dovetail a technical piece with maybe another program that's a little bit less technical, but again, ensuring that over a period of time, you're going through those programs to making sure that they're,

1160
02:09:05,350 --> 02:09:08,196
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting edge and partnering with people in the industry.

1161
02:09:08,683 --> 02:09:12,385
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll get that feedback about whether your equipment is up to date.

1162
02:09:13,106 --> 02:09:25,032
[SPEAKER_00]: I did look through, I looked at your budget for the 17-18 school year and I did see where there were some capital funds and other monies allocated towards the, I think, some of the facilities and the program and equipment.

1163
02:09:25,653 --> 02:09:29,275
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a key piece and that's important.

1164
02:09:29,475 --> 02:09:36,919
[SPEAKER_00]: My plan as superintendent would be to be meeting with the director obviously on a regular basis to be kind of determining the needs for those students.

1165
02:09:37,998 --> 02:09:38,738
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

1166
02:09:38,878 --> 02:09:39,619
[SPEAKER_09]: That answers the question.

1167
02:09:39,659 --> 02:09:40,019
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1168
02:09:40,039 --> 02:09:40,559
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.

1169
02:09:41,079 --> 02:09:41,260
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

1170
02:09:41,280 --> 02:09:41,740
[SPEAKER_11]: Mastron.

1171
02:09:41,780 --> 02:09:42,160
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1172
02:09:43,941 --> 02:09:44,681
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice to see you.

1173
02:09:44,881 --> 02:09:46,702
[SPEAKER_08]: Very good to see you.

1174
02:09:46,722 --> 02:09:51,904
[SPEAKER_08]: So I guess my basic question is, what do you see as the primary role of the superintendent?

1175
02:09:52,545 --> 02:09:59,388
[SPEAKER_08]: And then following that, how would you take, what would your first steps be if you were to be the next Medford superintendent?

1176
02:10:06,905 --> 02:10:13,091
[SPEAKER_00]: The primary role of the superintendent really is to be the ambassador between the school district and the community.

1177
02:10:14,492 --> 02:10:18,195
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think part of that role, a large part,

1178
02:10:19,716 --> 02:10:23,240
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just say, in my estimation, is focused on communication.

1179
02:10:24,702 --> 02:10:28,566
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I feel as though it's through really good communication that trust is built.

1180
02:10:29,387 --> 02:10:36,976
[SPEAKER_00]: And people in the community, one, they send their children to us every day, and they look for them to be educated, and they also look for them to be safe.

1181
02:10:37,897 --> 02:10:40,978
[SPEAKER_00]: And they I think So I am a community member.

1182
02:10:40,998 --> 02:10:41,639
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in Medford.

1183
02:10:42,079 --> 02:11:02,488
[SPEAKER_00]: They also I think are looking for their their contributions to the school system to be used in an efficient way that will get the most leverage for kids and And I feel as though coming into a district There's always the piece around a thoughtful entry plan which includes really learning as much as you can about the district and that and

1184
02:11:02,948 --> 02:11:07,309
[SPEAKER_00]: is primarily accomplished through a lot of listening and reading and investigating.

1185
02:11:07,349 --> 02:11:11,630
[SPEAKER_00]: You're really a sponge and you're learning as much as you can about the organization.

1186
02:11:12,330 --> 02:11:15,491
[SPEAKER_00]: And that doesn't just happen by walking through schools.

1187
02:11:15,571 --> 02:11:16,452
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a piece.

1188
02:11:17,272 --> 02:11:24,594
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's the piece about being on the community as you're building your entry plan and as you're kind of working and developing that plan.

1189
02:11:24,614 --> 02:11:27,634
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're visible in the community.

1190
02:11:27,654 --> 02:11:29,315
[SPEAKER_00]: You're reaching out to constituents.

1191
02:11:29,997 --> 02:11:33,702
[SPEAKER_00]: you're talking to students, and I'm thinking about all students.

1192
02:11:34,463 --> 02:11:47,681
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when I say all, I don't think I can talk to all 4,600 students in Medford, but I do think you're talking to student groups, parent groups, and you're thoughtfully entering in as a learner.

1193
02:11:48,437 --> 02:11:49,679
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you're demonstrating that.

1194
02:11:50,720 --> 02:11:58,070
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think really the communication piece, though, is critical because I think that's where relationships are built.

1195
02:11:59,192 --> 02:12:03,417
[SPEAKER_00]: And trust really is the underpinning of a lot of those relationships.

1196
02:12:04,078 --> 02:12:04,499
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1197
02:12:04,879 --> 02:12:05,240
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.

1198
02:12:06,331 --> 02:12:07,812
[SPEAKER_11]: Justin, did you have a question?

1199
02:12:08,212 --> 02:12:09,252
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.

1200
02:12:11,193 --> 02:12:13,233
[SPEAKER_11]: Would you like me to ask one, and then we'll come back?

1201
02:12:13,273 --> 02:12:13,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1202
02:12:13,714 --> 02:12:14,014
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

1203
02:12:16,895 --> 02:12:28,739
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you were to look up the statistics for the city of Medford school system, you'll find that 34% are minorities, and the first language at home being non-English language is 23.6%.

1204
02:12:29,399 --> 02:12:35,301
[SPEAKER_11]: Could you compare that to your current school system that you're in, and in particular the school that you're in, and describe

1205
02:12:35,680 --> 02:12:38,141
[SPEAKER_11]: Does it match up, or is it extremely different?

1206
02:12:39,721 --> 02:12:43,442
[SPEAKER_00]: So I currently, what I would share with you is this.

1207
02:12:43,922 --> 02:12:47,063
[SPEAKER_00]: I work in Lexington currently, and I've been there for eight years.

1208
02:12:47,643 --> 02:12:53,904
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say that we have experienced exponential growth in the number of students that are non-English speaking.

1209
02:12:54,865 --> 02:13:02,546
[SPEAKER_00]: That includes students who are perhaps newcomers that come to us with absolutely no English, and then kids who have another language spoken at home.

1210
02:13:06,071 --> 02:13:14,134
[SPEAKER_00]: It was interesting because I was just talking with my ELL teacher a little bit about working to meet the needs of English language learners.

1211
02:13:15,214 --> 02:13:19,116
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we've done some work as a school.

1212
02:13:21,360 --> 02:13:26,984
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about kids that come in with absolutely no language, and how do we support those students?

1213
02:13:27,644 --> 02:13:29,786
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we support students and how do we support families?

1214
02:13:30,686 --> 02:13:38,412
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was thinking a little bit about, okay, if I were a parent who did not speak English, what would my first, if you will, foray be into a district?

1215
02:13:38,952 --> 02:13:43,375
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm thinking one of the first things it would be would be if I had to register my child.

1216
02:13:44,075 --> 02:13:45,536
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the first places people go.

1217
02:13:46,797 --> 02:13:47,177
[SPEAKER_00]: And then,

1218
02:13:48,283 --> 02:13:51,966
[SPEAKER_00]: The other piece is getting your child to school and interacting with the school.

1219
02:13:52,246 --> 02:14:04,377
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was really thinking about, as a community, how do we, one, come to recognize and understand diversity and what it means for the community?

1220
02:14:04,964 --> 02:14:09,846
[SPEAKER_00]: but then to support students who may not be able to access language.

1221
02:14:10,326 --> 02:14:17,649
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the work we've done, I feel like, has been extremely meaningful based on parent feedback.

1222
02:14:18,289 --> 02:14:25,771
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the work we've done with our English language learners, particularly newcomers, has been to build mentoring programs.

1223
02:14:26,452 --> 02:14:30,653
[SPEAKER_00]: Those have been very easy programs to build where kids actually are partnered up with an adult.

1224
02:14:31,193 --> 02:14:32,394
[SPEAKER_00]: And the focus is not

1225
02:14:33,942 --> 02:14:36,544
[SPEAKER_00]: focus is not on, let's say, academic vocabulary.

1226
02:14:37,204 --> 02:14:43,409
[SPEAKER_00]: The focus is about conversation and helping those students, if you will, kind of acclimate to the school and the district.

1227
02:14:44,009 --> 02:14:46,731
[SPEAKER_00]: The other piece that we've done through that mentoring is that

1228
02:14:47,631 --> 02:14:49,712
[SPEAKER_00]: we've also provided a form for parents.

1229
02:14:50,272 --> 02:14:54,334
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we have found sometimes our ELL parents aren't able to maybe navigate the website.

1230
02:14:54,414 --> 02:14:58,015
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do have translators built into the website.

1231
02:14:58,895 --> 02:15:05,538
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've used Google Translate at all, what I would share with you is that it's not always a very clear translation.

1232
02:15:06,098 --> 02:15:12,240
[SPEAKER_00]: So my family in Italy, when I translate for them, they can tell when I'm speaking on my own in Italian or when I'm using Google.

1233
02:15:13,201 --> 02:15:15,401
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's not always a clean translation.

1234
02:15:15,661 --> 02:15:16,702
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I will say,

1235
02:15:17,262 --> 02:15:24,387
[SPEAKER_00]: In the absence of having someone who's a native translator to translate every conversation, you provide far greater access to those parents.

1236
02:15:24,487 --> 02:15:35,834
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm thinking about central registration, I'm thinking about entering into a school, and I'm thinking about a website where parents will go to get information on how accessible that is.

1237
02:15:36,715 --> 02:15:42,638
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's also a piece, if you will, and you have a community that has a growing population of

1238
02:15:43,940 --> 02:15:53,802
[SPEAKER_00]: students and families that don't speak English, I do think it's a community responsibility to be supporting everyone in the community, the school community and the greater community.

1239
02:15:53,842 --> 02:16:04,245
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel as though there are oftentimes forums that I feel like are a great opportunity to share perspectives and gather input.

1240
02:16:05,185 --> 02:16:08,386
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also seen Harvard Graduate School of Education has a great survey

1241
02:16:08,906 --> 02:16:20,596
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tailored in a number of different languages, and that survey can be shared with families whose language is one other than English, and schools and districts can gather a lot of important information from that.

1242
02:16:21,677 --> 02:16:26,301
[SPEAKER_11]: So what is the composition of the school that you're in right now?

1243
02:16:26,421 --> 02:16:33,728
[SPEAKER_00]: The school that I'm in right now, we have 500 students, and we have approximately 70 students that speak, that are identified as ELL.

1244
02:16:34,664 --> 02:16:41,768
[SPEAKER_00]: That may not be necessarily, those are kids getting direct services, maybe not our former language English proficient students.

1245
02:16:42,689 --> 02:16:52,134
[SPEAKER_00]: We generally as a district have worked to have approximately one ELL teacher for about every 30 students.

1246
02:16:53,234 --> 02:17:01,259
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we've done is, at least I can speak at my school, so I think one of the challenges always that for newcomers

1247
02:17:02,026 --> 02:17:06,567
[SPEAKER_00]: The recommendation is that they have one and a half to two hours a day of English instruction.

1248
02:17:07,868 --> 02:17:19,851
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really, and we've had these discussions, the challenge is that they need to have that instruction in English, but you also want them in classrooms where they're hearing academic conversations and other

1249
02:17:20,427 --> 02:17:30,115
[SPEAKER_00]: other language related to learning, English, or sometimes you also want those students to be able to speak and you wanna see what they understand in their native language.

1250
02:17:30,695 --> 02:17:46,968
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like there's an, if you will, an ongoing tension around having those students be fully participatory in class, so they're acquiring English language skills, but then giving, for instance, newcomers that very intense amount of instruction that they need to be able to access curriculum.

1251
02:17:48,803 --> 02:17:51,426
[SPEAKER_11]: Is Lexington a METCO school?

1252
02:17:51,566 --> 02:17:52,828
[SPEAKER_00]: Lexington is a METCO system.

1253
02:17:53,329 --> 02:17:58,455
[SPEAKER_11]: So of your 70, are any of those METCO students, or are they Lexington residents?

1254
02:17:58,815 --> 02:17:58,895
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

1255
02:18:02,842 --> 02:18:18,705
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of our students, so what happens is when students enter into a district, their families complete a home language survey, and based on that home language survey, you do a screening, and you look to see if those students perhaps are in need of English language support.

1256
02:18:19,927 --> 02:18:30,616
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do have, my school, because we've had very significant amounts of enrollment, we've not been able to take as many MedCo students, so we probably have about 11 right now in my school.

1257
02:18:31,437 --> 02:18:36,362
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those students are ELL students, and then some are not.

1258
02:18:36,402 --> 02:18:40,025
[SPEAKER_00]: So the preponderance are students from Lexington.

1259
02:18:40,746 --> 02:18:41,386
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

1260
02:18:41,486 --> 02:18:41,907
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.

1261
02:18:42,087 --> 02:18:42,467
[SPEAKER_11]: Justin?

1262
02:18:43,208 --> 02:18:43,408
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello.

1263
02:18:45,402 --> 02:18:54,668
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you may know, the Medford High School is in the process of integrating with the Vogue.

1264
02:18:55,109 --> 02:19:06,076
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the biggest issues faced with this integration is the aligning GPAs from the Vogue side and the academic side.

1265
02:19:07,217 --> 02:19:14,582
[SPEAKER_01]: Many Vogue students who were in the top 10 before now find themselves applying to colleges while their rank is in the top 100.

1266
02:19:15,923 --> 02:19:28,661
[SPEAKER_01]: And to them, it doesn't seem fair because they've worked hard for their grades and suddenly compared to everyone else in the weighting system that we have, they've slipped.

1267
02:19:30,819 --> 02:19:32,741
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the academic part of that.

1268
02:19:33,723 --> 02:19:42,492
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's also a social component to that as well, in that a lot of VOC students feel like they're outnumbered by high school students.

1269
02:19:43,233 --> 02:19:47,178
[SPEAKER_01]: How would you reconcile these differences, academically and socially?

1270
02:19:53,095 --> 02:19:59,920
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've read, obviously, that there's been, if you will, this kind of meshing of the career and technical education in the high school.

1271
02:20:00,661 --> 02:20:08,707
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do think, I think sometimes with really great things come some obviously unintended consequences.

1272
02:20:09,247 --> 02:20:10,828
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this sounds like one of them.

1273
02:20:11,869 --> 02:20:22,117
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it would be important, one, for the district, the high school principal, the director of the Vo-Tech, first and foremost,

1274
02:20:23,571 --> 02:20:40,705
[SPEAKER_00]: investigate some ways that they might remediate the issue around GPA and student standing because clearly it is important to those students and I think my guess is it's probably important to them both academically and then the way that perceptually if you will.

1275
02:20:42,166 --> 02:20:45,889
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I will tell you I'm somebody who's fairly tenacious.

1276
02:20:45,949 --> 02:20:47,650
[SPEAKER_00]: I generally if I set my mind to something I

1277
02:20:48,479 --> 02:20:50,180
[SPEAKER_00]: most times accomplish it, or I come very close.

1278
02:20:51,141 --> 02:21:05,013
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would be hoping that there would be ongoing discussions with the students at the vocational technical school, and the director, and the principal, and whether it's a superintendent or assistant superintendent.

1279
02:21:05,033 --> 02:21:12,179
[SPEAKER_00]: There would be some conversations there to see what would be a way that that might be addressed that would

1280
02:21:13,706 --> 02:21:23,212
[SPEAKER_00]: not take away from the integrity of the grading for either high school students or those students in the career and technical education, but somehow be a middle ground, and if there were a win-win.

1281
02:21:24,033 --> 02:21:42,325
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, likewise, I think it would be important to perhaps, at least in the interim, because it perhaps could change over time, but I feel like those students need to be provided a voice as to how they're feeling, and that needs to be taken into consideration because

1282
02:21:44,020 --> 02:21:50,422
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're, you know, there's a lot of talk now about diversity and inclusion and equity.

1283
02:21:51,122 --> 02:21:59,725
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think if you're thinking about diversity and equity inclusion, I don't think that necessarily always comes down to just race.

1284
02:22:00,145 --> 02:22:02,926
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're also thinking about all students.

1285
02:22:03,406 --> 02:22:08,587
[SPEAKER_00]: And so how do those students feel included or not included in the general population?

1286
02:22:10,908 --> 02:22:23,763
[SPEAKER_00]: would be good is that if there were some type of a forum that not only included those students, but because there's a greater population of students from the high school, I would think that it would be important that those students be included in the conversation.

1287
02:22:24,684 --> 02:22:29,811
[SPEAKER_00]: An appropriate forum might be a student senate forum or some other forum where those voices could be heard.

1288
02:22:31,716 --> 02:22:38,100
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes it might just be that other people need to hear how those people feel.

1289
02:22:38,280 --> 02:22:50,388
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my experience is that sometimes when people are maybe feeling disenfranchised, one of the best ways to, if you will, begin to meet their needs is to be a listener and to build some empathy there.

1290
02:22:51,869 --> 02:23:08,685
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it requires building empathy on the side of the greater population of students who may not be understanding how those students in the career and technical education are feeling, and then how to build some bridges between both so that everybody feels like it's an inclusive community.

1291
02:23:09,907 --> 02:23:11,048
[SPEAKER_00]: And that may take some time.

1292
02:23:13,430 --> 02:23:13,750
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.

1293
02:23:14,151 --> 02:23:14,511
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1294
02:23:14,791 --> 02:23:14,952
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

1295
02:23:14,972 --> 02:23:15,412
[SPEAKER_11]: Vianicludz.

1296
02:23:18,444 --> 02:23:19,264
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, Dr. Martelone.

1297
02:23:20,345 --> 02:23:28,728
[SPEAKER_07]: I noticed in your resume that there was a year when you went over to the dark side and you worked at the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education.

1298
02:23:29,348 --> 02:23:36,191
[SPEAKER_07]: Could you tell us what brought you there and what you learned during that year and why you left?

1299
02:23:36,911 --> 02:23:37,231
[SPEAKER_00]: Surely.

1300
02:23:38,587 --> 02:23:44,348
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was, I began my career, my educational career in Maine.

1301
02:23:44,649 --> 02:23:47,229
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a teacher and an administrator for quite a while.

1302
02:23:48,009 --> 02:23:49,670
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm originally from Roslindale.

1303
02:23:50,690 --> 02:23:58,052
[SPEAKER_00]: I will tell you I did wake up a number of times in Maine and I wondered how I got there because it was, it was definitely,

1304
02:23:59,272 --> 02:24:03,735
[SPEAKER_00]: It was definitely not an urban or suburban community, which I had been used to as a youngster.

1305
02:24:03,815 --> 02:24:05,717
[SPEAKER_00]: My family is all from the Boston area.

1306
02:24:05,757 --> 02:24:09,899
[SPEAKER_00]: We lived away for a long time, and then, as I mentioned, I began my career in Maine.

1307
02:24:12,041 --> 02:24:19,226
[SPEAKER_00]: At one point in my teaching career, I worked for a principal, and she had moved to Massachusetts, and she worked for the Department of Education.

1308
02:24:20,066 --> 02:24:23,149
[SPEAKER_00]: And she worked closely with a commissioner,

1309
02:24:26,587 --> 02:24:42,713
[SPEAKER_00]: I periodically would see her when she would come home to Maine and we would be talking and I was sharing with her some of the work that we were doing at my school around tiered systems of intervention for students and the work we were doing around helping students at risk.

1310
02:24:44,554 --> 02:24:49,035
[SPEAKER_00]: We had been doing that work with what I would consider very good results.

1311
02:24:52,396 --> 02:24:59,151
[SPEAKER_00]: I just happened to see her and she said to me, look, we have an opening that will be coming up at the department.

1312
02:25:01,618 --> 02:25:06,703
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, with your skills and experience, I really feel that you would be able to help school districts.

1313
02:25:07,483 --> 02:25:10,766
[SPEAKER_00]: So the job was with the division of the department.

1314
02:25:10,846 --> 02:25:12,648
[SPEAKER_00]: It was called Urban and District Assistance.

1315
02:25:13,228 --> 02:25:19,074
[SPEAKER_00]: And my job as an upper level manager was to work with large urban school districts.

1316
02:25:19,314 --> 02:25:23,037
[SPEAKER_00]: So during my time there, I worked with Boston Public Schools.

1317
02:25:23,558 --> 02:25:26,180
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked with Lawrence, New Bedford, and Lynn.

1318
02:25:27,139 --> 02:25:40,997
[SPEAKER_00]: So right around the time that I was there was about the time that there was a large Department of Justice inquiry into the city of Boston because they had underserved approximately 4,500 ELL students.

1319
02:25:43,740 --> 02:25:48,424
[SPEAKER_00]: And so part of my work was to work with the public schools in leveraging money.

1320
02:25:48,524 --> 02:25:59,473
[SPEAKER_00]: So we granted money to districts, and then we would go out, I would go out, and I would work with these districts to see if we could leverage some of those grant monies

1321
02:26:00,266 --> 02:26:02,967
[SPEAKER_00]: for the benefit of students to improve programs.

1322
02:26:03,007 --> 02:26:14,110
[SPEAKER_00]: So part of the work I was doing in Boston, we had a multi-million dollar grant and we were looking for them to find ways to give ELL students compensatory services.

1323
02:26:14,830 --> 02:26:19,131
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the work, other work I did in Boston, I worked at English High School with the principal there.

1324
02:26:19,151 --> 02:26:21,312
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a relatively new principal.

1325
02:26:22,112 --> 02:26:24,074
[SPEAKER_00]: and I worked with him and his leadership team.

1326
02:26:24,254 --> 02:26:31,319
[SPEAKER_00]: In New Bedford, I was working with them around developing a principal, what's called a PLC, a learning community.

1327
02:26:31,979 --> 02:26:46,289
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Lawrence, we were also looking at professional learning communities, and at the same time, we were facilitating what we called learning walks, which were engagements in schools where we would go out and go through schools and look at practice.

1328
02:26:48,351 --> 02:26:49,792
[SPEAKER_00]: What I would share with you is that

1329
02:26:53,260 --> 02:27:01,390
[SPEAKER_00]: My drive has been, from the day I stepped foot into a classroom as a teacher until today, has been around helping kids.

1330
02:27:02,331 --> 02:27:10,841
[SPEAKER_00]: And the unfortunate thing was, is that I felt as though I was fighting a tide of bureaucracy at the department.

1331
02:27:11,491 --> 02:27:21,896
[SPEAKER_00]: And school districts were not always willing to be partners with us because of everything that came along with, if you will, taking grant money, and there were stipulations and things that they needed to do.

1332
02:27:23,037 --> 02:27:30,800
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really missed, if you will, getting traction for kids, because that's where my heart is.

1333
02:27:31,240 --> 02:27:40,285
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I feel like some of the best work I've done is getting movement for children in a positive way, academically, socially, emotionally.

1334
02:27:41,695 --> 02:27:53,853
[SPEAKER_00]: It just so happened that at the time I came back to Boston, I had a colleague from Maine who also moved to Massachusetts, and she let me know about a job opening in Lexington, and thus my return to public education.

1335
02:28:01,874 --> 02:28:14,786
[SPEAKER_07]: Could you speak to a time when you had to address parents about a difficult event that took place in a school that you were overseeing or a change that you had to implement that was unpopular where you had to address parents?

1336
02:28:21,559 --> 02:28:27,003
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will say I've been lucky where I've had a number of things that I've had to tell parents about that they've been really pleased.

1337
02:28:28,004 --> 02:28:32,728
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there also have been times where I've had to implement changes that perhaps were not the most popular.

1338
02:28:34,309 --> 02:28:45,678
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my current school and in my last school, I've been involved in situations where

1339
02:28:47,819 --> 02:28:49,399
[SPEAKER_00]: I've identified some safety concerns.

1340
02:28:49,860 --> 02:28:57,362
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my previous school, we had a massive construction project where we reconstructed pretty much the whole building.

1341
02:28:57,782 --> 02:28:59,562
[SPEAKER_00]: We put on significant additions.

1342
02:29:00,382 --> 02:29:06,964
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started at that particular school probably about a year before the project was finished.

1343
02:29:08,565 --> 02:29:13,626
[SPEAKER_00]: But I had inherited a school where people could very freely walk into the school at any time.

1344
02:29:14,906 --> 02:29:18,467
[SPEAKER_00]: There were safety concerns around access and people coming in.

1345
02:29:20,068 --> 02:29:33,111
[SPEAKER_00]: As we did the building project and as we redesigned the building, I advocated around one point of entry and other things that were related to, if you will, the physical structure of the building.

1346
02:29:33,712 --> 02:29:39,773
[SPEAKER_00]: But then also I implemented some changes that were based on what I observed to be some safety concerns.

1347
02:29:40,813 --> 02:30:00,537
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, at the school I'm at now, after the incident in Newtown, Connecticut, I think it's unfortunate that after events that are tragic, school shootings, people really start to, again, revisit their safety practices.

1348
02:30:00,597 --> 02:30:02,957
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think because it highlights those concerns.

1349
02:30:04,020 --> 02:30:11,486
[SPEAKER_00]: So after the Newtown incident at my current school, we put in place some safety protocols.

1350
02:30:11,686 --> 02:30:20,152
[SPEAKER_00]: We put in some practices that I think were different from what people were used to and seemed a little bit more restrictive.

1351
02:30:21,113 --> 02:30:26,196
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the same time, we also tried to be thoughtful about how we could continue to make our schools feel welcoming.

1352
02:30:27,858 --> 02:30:31,100
[SPEAKER_00]: I think those were not always met with

1353
02:30:34,275 --> 02:30:42,276
[SPEAKER_00]: they weren't always met with positive intent, I think, for those people who were told, you need to now come to the front door, you need to sign into the office.

1354
02:30:42,717 --> 02:30:49,058
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you're here volunteering, you need to go to where you're volunteering and then you need to check out and leave.

1355
02:30:49,118 --> 02:30:56,799
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think people felt as though that they weren't welcome.

1356
02:30:56,979 --> 02:31:01,000
[SPEAKER_00]: And clearly, we worked to really, we worked to pre-communicate

1357
02:31:01,536 --> 02:31:04,906
[SPEAKER_00]: and then communicate during and then communicate after those changes were made.

1358
02:31:05,573 --> 02:31:08,736
[SPEAKER_00]: that we did welcome parents and that we did want people involved.

1359
02:31:09,156 --> 02:31:15,961
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we also had to, and as a building administrator, I had to take into consideration the safety of all students and staff.

1360
02:31:16,581 --> 02:31:31,833
[SPEAKER_00]: And so while large portions of the parent population of the community understood those changes, there were people who were upset and felt as though their being able to be part of the school was somewhat restricted.

1361
02:31:32,881 --> 02:31:33,201
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1362
02:31:33,521 --> 02:31:33,941
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.

1363
02:31:34,401 --> 02:31:35,102
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Russo.

1364
02:31:36,142 --> 02:31:36,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening.

1365
02:31:36,902 --> 02:31:37,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

1366
02:31:39,623 --> 02:31:40,583
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a short question.

1367
02:31:40,863 --> 02:31:41,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

1368
02:31:41,063 --> 02:31:42,163
[SPEAKER_04]: Not necessarily a short answer.

1369
02:31:43,424 --> 02:31:48,705
[SPEAKER_04]: What is a popular educational initiative or practice of which you are skeptical and why?

1370
02:31:54,666 --> 02:31:59,027
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I would share with you is this is my 24th year in education.

1371
02:32:01,653 --> 02:32:06,083
[SPEAKER_00]: You've probably heard this before, I think, sometimes things come and sometimes things go.

1372
02:32:07,566 --> 02:32:09,510
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they come back again, and then they leave.

1373
02:32:10,352 --> 02:32:10,793
[SPEAKER_00]: And so...

1374
02:32:13,018 --> 02:32:19,260
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like over the last several years, and I'll tell you what I'm skeptical of, and then I'm going to clarify.

1375
02:32:20,100 --> 02:32:41,245
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think, if you will, for a period of time, walkthroughs were all of the rage, which really, a walkthrough is a process by which a school may pick a focus or a problem of practice, and they may send groups of educators out to go around the school and do very quick, if you will,

1376
02:32:41,665 --> 02:32:51,302
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll call them observations, not for evaluative purposes, but to gather, let's say, data or trends about the school or student learning, a number of factors.

1377
02:32:56,380 --> 02:33:00,142
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm skeptical about walkthroughs when people aren't doing them thoughtfully.

1378
02:33:00,462 --> 02:33:12,587
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people hear about something new and it sounds promising and it sounds exciting, but I don't know that they necessarily always think through kind of, if you will, the process or kind of the strategic purpose behind it.

1379
02:33:13,147 --> 02:33:21,110
[SPEAKER_00]: So for instance, a walkthrough really would be intended, it could be intended for a couple things.

1380
02:33:21,150 --> 02:33:22,531
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be to look at practice.

1381
02:33:23,291 --> 02:33:25,712
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be to look at student engagement.

1382
02:33:26,933 --> 02:33:30,355
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be to look at a specific teaching strategy.

1383
02:33:31,636 --> 02:33:36,378
[SPEAKER_00]: So you enter into the walkthrough with a purpose behind it, and then you gather data.

1384
02:33:36,638 --> 02:33:38,679
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you need to be doing something with that data.

1385
02:33:39,100 --> 02:33:52,847
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you invite, over time, hundreds of people to your school, and then you do nothing with the walkthrough data, then you've created an exercise in which maybe teachers aren't informed, and the school itself reaps no benefit.

1386
02:33:53,453 --> 02:34:00,414
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm skeptical when people say, oh, we're doing walkthroughs, or we're doing instructional rounds, or we're doing learning walks.

1387
02:34:00,855 --> 02:34:13,437
[SPEAKER_00]: Those, I think, what I'm skeptical of is when people kind of, if you will, jump on a bandwagon to do something new, but don't really understand the purpose behind it, or don't leverage really what the intent was.

1388
02:34:15,858 --> 02:34:16,398
[SPEAKER_11]: Sebastian?

1389
02:34:17,458 --> 02:34:17,558
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh.

1390
02:34:22,479 --> 02:34:23,179
[SPEAKER_05]: It's nice to meet you.

1391
02:34:23,444 --> 02:34:24,024
[SPEAKER_00]: Very nice to meet you.

1392
02:34:25,726 --> 02:34:37,435
[SPEAKER_05]: So looking at your resume, you've obviously worked in Lewiston, Auburn, which has limited resources, as well as Lexington, which is, I would say, less so.

1393
02:34:39,636 --> 02:34:40,257
[SPEAKER_05]: Quite a bit less.

1394
02:34:43,059 --> 02:34:45,881
[SPEAKER_05]: My question to you is, where do you see Medford?

1395
02:34:47,103 --> 02:35:03,246
[SPEAKER_05]: And how would you use your experience and be a leader to address that situation, maybe recognizing, I guess, our financial, you know, where we are as a socioeconomic class in Medford.

1396
02:35:05,586 --> 02:35:06,946
[SPEAKER_05]: How would you move forward with that?

1397
02:35:08,027 --> 02:35:09,187
[SPEAKER_00]: Surely, that's a great question.

1398
02:35:10,287 --> 02:35:13,468
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's interesting and you bring up a good point.

1399
02:35:13,488 --> 02:35:16,228
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I worked in a school district where every year,

1400
02:35:17,312 --> 02:35:24,275
[SPEAKER_00]: We would come around the table as a group of administrators, and my superintendent would say to the team, we need to cut a million dollars.

1401
02:35:25,236 --> 02:35:29,938
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, those were always tough discussions and tough decisions.

1402
02:35:30,058 --> 02:35:37,281
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I would share with you is that it could be painful at times, because people would come up with small, if you will, small ticket items.

1403
02:35:37,662 --> 02:35:38,542
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I can cut this for $20,000.

1404
02:35:39,062 --> 02:35:45,045
[SPEAKER_00]: And so at the other end of the spectrum, I do work in a district now.

1405
02:35:46,006 --> 02:35:49,888
[SPEAKER_00]: that socioeconomically is very different than the district I had in Maine.

1406
02:35:50,028 --> 02:35:53,811
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of resources available to me at the school and then at the district.

1407
02:35:54,891 --> 02:36:08,118
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess what I will tell you is that, which might give you a little bit of insight into me and how I think, I still operate in Lexington with the same kind of fiscal mindset that I did in Maine.

1408
02:36:09,039 --> 02:36:14,422
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I don't take for granted that money is always available and I had to work for many years without having a lot of resources.

1409
02:36:15,188 --> 02:36:26,220
[SPEAKER_00]: So, in thinking about Medford, you know, the first, again, I've said this earlier, the first focus is always about students and what students need.

1410
02:36:26,860 --> 02:36:30,905
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, when you're thinking about building budgets or developing programs,

1411
02:36:31,933 --> 02:36:38,879
[SPEAKER_00]: you're thinking, as a superintendent, I need to be thinking about what's best for kids and what's best for the system.

1412
02:36:39,300 --> 02:36:45,545
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I also have to be kind of managing and thinking about, you know, I said earlier, I'm an ambassador to the community.

1413
02:36:46,025 --> 02:36:50,389
[SPEAKER_00]: And so communities don't have endless pots of money, if you will.

1414
02:36:51,050 --> 02:36:57,896
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really about thinking, what is the very best education that we can provide students in Medford?

1415
02:36:58,856 --> 02:37:02,720
[SPEAKER_00]: And what are the tools that we need to support providing them that education?

1416
02:37:03,461 --> 02:37:07,926
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, what are we currently, what are our circumstances that we're operating under?

1417
02:37:08,707 --> 02:37:10,509
[SPEAKER_00]: And where can we make some growth?

1418
02:37:11,149 --> 02:37:14,092
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there things that we're doing that maybe we shouldn't do anymore?

1419
02:37:14,253 --> 02:37:17,937
[SPEAKER_00]: And those will result in us being able to perhaps shift monies in other places.

1420
02:37:18,617 --> 02:37:20,119
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you also have to be creative.

1421
02:37:21,479 --> 02:37:25,122
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you have to be creative around how you're spending money.

1422
02:37:26,263 --> 02:37:33,488
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when I say creative, meaning that as a superintendent, you're always looking for efficiencies.

1423
02:37:34,489 --> 02:37:37,991
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not doing that at the expense of students and teachers and families.

1424
02:37:38,051 --> 02:37:45,156
[SPEAKER_00]: But what you're looking at is, how can I leverage what we have to best meet the needs of kids?

1425
02:37:45,697 --> 02:37:48,639
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, I think, is part of a dialogue that happens.

1426
02:37:50,553 --> 02:37:52,074
[SPEAKER_00]: with the superintendent and the school committee.

1427
02:37:52,614 --> 02:37:56,195
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a dialogue that a superintendent has out in the community.

1428
02:37:56,595 --> 02:37:59,155
[SPEAKER_00]: So I live in the community.

1429
02:37:59,215 --> 02:38:00,476
[SPEAKER_00]: I know people would be asking me.

1430
02:38:00,556 --> 02:38:06,117
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably would not make it out of the grocery store, and I'm sure people would want to be asking me what my thoughts are.

1431
02:38:07,018 --> 02:38:11,919
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if I'm out, people are going to want to hear, how will I ensure that kids get what they need?

1432
02:38:12,639 --> 02:38:14,780
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, fiscally, I will say,

1433
02:38:15,908 --> 02:38:24,939
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably operate a little bit more conservatively, but I do that because I want to make sure that we get kids what they need in a meaningful way.

1434
02:38:34,153 --> 02:38:45,122
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, so a lot of social science teachers are pushing for a reinstatement of a civics curriculum in our education.

1435
02:38:45,302 --> 02:38:51,727
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think is the role of civic engagement at the high school, the middle school, and the elementary levels?

1436
02:38:52,427 --> 02:38:52,627
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

1437
02:38:56,350 --> 02:38:57,411
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll start with the elementary.

1438
02:38:57,911 --> 02:38:58,552
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll work my way up.

1439
02:38:59,201 --> 02:39:09,123
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think, if you will, at the elementary level, I think civic engagement can begin very simply within a classroom community.

1440
02:39:10,083 --> 02:39:12,824
[SPEAKER_00]: Teachers build those classroom communities at the start of the school year.

1441
02:39:14,124 --> 02:39:17,564
[SPEAKER_00]: They do that through structures like what is called morning meeting.

1442
02:39:18,565 --> 02:39:21,085
[SPEAKER_00]: They do that by assigning jobs in classrooms.

1443
02:39:21,485 --> 02:39:25,246
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there are lots of things that kind of, if you will, are the precursor at the elementary age.

1444
02:39:25,726 --> 02:39:26,906
[SPEAKER_00]: to civic engagement.

1445
02:39:27,787 --> 02:39:32,348
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the work I've done has been around setting some school goals.

1446
02:39:32,588 --> 02:39:41,230
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done that with our student council, and those students work to develop, if you will, a community goal, a class goal, and a school goal.

1447
02:39:42,270 --> 02:39:54,673
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's been meaningful for students, and it's been developmentally appropriate for elementary students to begin thinking about civic-mindedness.

1448
02:39:55,793 --> 02:40:05,579
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll also just say there is a piece actually in the teacher evaluation rubrics around teachers doing work around civic engagement and civic mindedness.

1449
02:40:05,639 --> 02:40:11,542
[SPEAKER_00]: So I sometimes am saying to teachers, okay, what can you do to be promoting that?

1450
02:40:11,782 --> 02:40:13,243
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a piece there.

1451
02:40:14,123 --> 02:40:26,005
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, at the middle school level, I think you're thinking about where kids are developmentally and around, if you will, their own becoming aware, I think, of the greater world around them.

1452
02:40:26,045 --> 02:40:35,127
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that elementary schools aren't, but I think developmentally, middle school students are, if you will, kind of investigating more of the world.

1453
02:40:35,167 --> 02:40:43,649
[SPEAKER_00]: I think opportunities at middle school and then going on to high school would be any type of, if you will, like a model UN, a student senate,

1454
02:40:44,133 --> 02:40:45,674
[SPEAKER_00]: any type of student government body.

1455
02:40:45,794 --> 02:40:52,756
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that those are all great places to develop civic engagement.

1456
02:40:53,257 --> 02:40:55,757
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there could be coursework.

1457
02:40:55,838 --> 02:40:57,258
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's one piece.

1458
02:40:57,738 --> 02:41:01,500
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you're thinking about civic engagement, though, the key word really is engagement.

1459
02:41:02,200 --> 02:41:12,344
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you're thinking about how can we engage kids in a way that prepares them civically beyond high school.

1460
02:41:13,305 --> 02:41:23,657
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the engagement piece for some students, while they may not want to participate in a class or they may not take that particular elective, if it's offered as an elective, they may also get it in other ways.

1461
02:41:23,737 --> 02:41:26,059
[SPEAKER_00]: And that might be through the Senate.

1462
02:41:26,720 --> 02:41:28,102
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be through a student body.

1463
02:41:29,158 --> 02:41:30,960
[SPEAKER_00]: some type of a student government body.

1464
02:41:31,500 --> 02:41:41,848
[SPEAKER_00]: The other piece, and I just saw an interesting video clip the other day, was not only teaching the piece around civic engagement, but around civility as well.

1465
02:41:43,089 --> 02:41:50,414
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think as we're teaching kids about civic engagement, we're also really working about civility.

1466
02:41:50,795 --> 02:41:54,637
[SPEAKER_00]: And how does civility, how does that look in civil engagement?

1467
02:41:55,558 --> 02:41:58,399
[SPEAKER_00]: That may come up through debate teams.

1468
02:41:58,559 --> 02:42:08,842
[SPEAKER_00]: I think those are opportunities, those are teachable moments that teachers get all the time as they're helping kids interact with others in the world, perhaps beyond the school.

1469
02:42:09,302 --> 02:42:11,743
[SPEAKER_00]: That sometimes comes from community service as well.

1470
02:42:13,144 --> 02:42:23,887
[SPEAKER_00]: I know one thing that's been very popular at the middle school in Lexington, we've done it in other places, is to either have like a mock town meeting

1471
02:42:24,667 --> 02:42:31,072
[SPEAKER_00]: I think those opportunities that give kids an opportunity to kind of experience civic engagement as well.

1472
02:42:33,955 --> 02:42:42,741
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you see as the role of student leadership and student leadership groups in shaping school policy?

1473
02:42:45,163 --> 02:42:50,848
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess, so I want to just to

1474
02:42:51,912 --> 02:42:55,333
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have district policies, and those policies govern school districts.

1475
02:42:55,833 --> 02:43:01,114
[SPEAKER_00]: I think sometimes what happens is people call school policies policies when, in fact, perhaps they're procedures.

1476
02:43:02,735 --> 02:43:05,695
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I always think of, what's a policy?

1477
02:43:05,715 --> 02:43:08,416
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm thinking of a school district policy.

1478
02:43:09,336 --> 02:43:11,997
[SPEAKER_00]: I think schools have many practices and procedures.

1479
02:43:13,397 --> 02:43:18,138
[SPEAKER_00]: I do scratch my head a bit when we say a school policy, but I understand your intent.

1480
02:43:21,400 --> 02:43:27,962
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're looking for students to have agency, I think students need to have opportunities to voice opinions.

1481
02:43:29,003 --> 02:43:34,324
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a great way to practice what I just mentioned around civility.

1482
02:43:34,944 --> 02:43:44,448
[SPEAKER_00]: I think students want to be heard, and I think we oftentimes put, if you will, policy or practices into place.

1483
02:43:46,445 --> 02:43:48,648
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's intent and impact.

1484
02:43:48,888 --> 02:43:56,139
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think sometimes when we're putting things into place, we have an intent in our mind, but we don't always go back to think about what the impact will be for students.

1485
02:43:56,880 --> 02:43:57,641
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes...

1486
02:43:58,708 --> 02:44:00,569
[SPEAKER_00]: there are unintended consequences that come from there.

1487
02:44:01,089 --> 02:44:14,716
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there are times when we need to be reaching out to students and saying, we're looking for a governing body, a student body to give feedback and then provide opportunities for leadership.

1488
02:44:15,197 --> 02:44:25,722
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will say that obviously most recently, schools across Massachusetts and the country were, I'll say grappling, trying to figure out how to best support

1489
02:44:26,392 --> 02:44:28,073
[SPEAKER_00]: First Amendment rights and student walkouts.

1490
02:44:28,633 --> 02:44:41,477
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that for me was amazing was that our administrative team met with high school students and really talked through with them as they were kind of planning their student walkout.

1491
02:44:42,257 --> 02:44:50,300
[SPEAKER_00]: And we really were trying to walk a line where we were able to balance them exercising First Amendment rights.

1492
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:52,821
[SPEAKER_00]: We were trying to think about student safety.

1493
02:44:53,285 --> 02:44:59,088
[SPEAKER_00]: We were trying to think about civic engagement, if you will, and students having a voice there.

1494
02:44:59,748 --> 02:45:04,810
[SPEAKER_00]: And I felt like that was amazing that students were organizing.

1495
02:45:04,830 --> 02:45:15,235
[SPEAKER_00]: And not just that they were organizing, but that they were coming to the table and having discussions with all of the administrators, the superintendent, the chief of police,

1496
02:45:15,815 --> 02:45:18,336
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was a great opportunity there where students had voice.

1497
02:45:18,396 --> 02:45:36,884
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think in instances like that where you can involve students, I think you not only promote giving kids agency and a voice, but I think those are the types of people you want to go beyond the school community after they graduate and have a voice in the greater society.

1498
02:45:38,364 --> 02:45:38,765
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.

1499
02:45:38,825 --> 02:45:40,325
[SPEAKER_11]: Follow up on that?

1500
02:45:40,345 --> 02:45:44,007
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm curious about something.

1501
02:45:47,029 --> 02:45:50,312
[SPEAKER_05]: Say there was a student walkout tomorrow, which there's not going to be.

1502
02:45:52,254 --> 02:45:56,558
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for putting them all at ease.

1503
02:45:57,559 --> 02:46:02,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Just as a leader, would you go into specifics a little bit about how you would address that?

1504
02:46:05,768 --> 02:46:08,829
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I just touched a little bit upon how we addressed it recently.

1505
02:46:09,149 --> 02:46:13,770
[SPEAKER_00]: And I felt as though, I felt like we used a thoughtful approach.

1506
02:46:13,870 --> 02:46:15,971
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll kind of walk you through that.

1507
02:46:16,211 --> 02:46:18,872
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like it was a very good process.

1508
02:46:19,072 --> 02:46:19,872
[SPEAKER_00]: It was thoughtful.

1509
02:46:20,452 --> 02:46:29,295
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it helped create a partnership, a partnership between students and administrators in schools.

1510
02:46:29,695 --> 02:46:33,756
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think some people might scratch their head because people like a partnership between students and adults.

1511
02:46:34,383 --> 02:46:35,584
[SPEAKER_00]: We should be partnering with students.

1512
02:46:35,644 --> 02:46:38,945
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the people we're entrusted to care for and educate every day.

1513
02:46:39,145 --> 02:46:48,510
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things that we did, and obviously if a walkout happens and it's not known by administration, this was a little bit of a different situation.

1514
02:46:48,590 --> 02:46:53,492
[SPEAKER_00]: So we, if you will, employed the help of our school attorney.

1515
02:46:54,261 --> 02:47:01,165
[SPEAKER_00]: And we talked a little bit about our, if you will, our legal liability and what we were responsible for in regards to students.

1516
02:47:01,745 --> 02:47:17,934
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's important because while we wanted to honor students being able to have a voice and exercise First Amendment rights, we also knew that if kids were walking out while we were caring for them, that we also felt a sense of responsibility for them.

1517
02:47:19,997 --> 02:47:36,205
[SPEAKER_00]: The students went back and forth with a number of plans, and we engaged in dialogue with them about their plan, and then kind of, if you will, talked through what might have been some things that they perhaps might not have thought about.

1518
02:47:36,305 --> 02:47:44,669
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for instance, students wanted to assemble on the Battle Green, and there was some sharing around their march with some media.

1519
02:47:45,250 --> 02:47:48,131
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we were concerned that, if you will,

1520
02:47:48,883 --> 02:47:57,210
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're talking about a march for gun safety and there's going to be a meeting on the Lexington battle green, you're maybe inviting a situation.

1521
02:47:57,610 --> 02:48:01,493
[SPEAKER_00]: And so our work was to try to provide some guidance for students.

1522
02:48:02,214 --> 02:48:08,319
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the day, we really went back and forth in a dialogue, in a discussion.

1523
02:48:09,039 --> 02:48:16,510
[SPEAKER_00]: And the students, they, well, we ended up having a snow day on the day of the walkout.

1524
02:48:16,971 --> 02:48:20,396
[SPEAKER_00]: The students did still hold the walkout the day after.

1525
02:48:20,416 --> 02:48:25,363
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other piece, and I didn't mention this, but we also partnered with the chief of police.

1526
02:48:25,962 --> 02:48:28,924
[SPEAKER_00]: because the chief of police also wanted to ensure student safety as well.

1527
02:48:29,445 --> 02:48:41,293
[SPEAKER_00]: So what they were able to do was to really cordon off a very large section of road outside of the high school where students could safely walk out and prepare speeches and engage in

1528
02:48:42,097 --> 02:48:46,760
[SPEAKER_00]: discussion and discourse around gun violence and school safety.

1529
02:48:46,840 --> 02:48:57,986
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my estimation, we really reached a win-win because students were able to exercise their rights and we all felt like we were able to have a conversation with them.

1530
02:48:58,726 --> 02:49:00,967
[SPEAKER_00]: and ensure their safety while they were with us.

1531
02:49:01,268 --> 02:49:12,454
[SPEAKER_00]: We had plans also for students who did not participate in the walkout, and so we also needed to ensure their safety as well, and kind of create, if you will, an equitable situation for everyone.

1532
02:49:13,955 --> 02:49:14,335
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.

1533
02:49:14,436 --> 02:49:15,116
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Ruggiero?

1534
02:49:16,437 --> 02:49:16,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1535
02:49:16,837 --> 02:49:19,839
[SPEAKER_03]: I have some questions about blind spots and pitfalls.

1536
02:49:21,388 --> 02:49:31,694
[SPEAKER_03]: My first question is, in your decades of experience in education, what common pitfalls do you see superintendents fall into, and how would you avoid falling into those traps?

1537
02:49:34,916 --> 02:49:45,522
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I think it's, I will say on some level it's similar to, if you will, being a building administrator, although it's scaled up obviously to a district.

1538
02:49:46,543 --> 02:49:47,023
[SPEAKER_00]: I think

1539
02:49:49,088 --> 02:49:55,875
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes the very best leaders hire great people and they let them make lots of decisions independently.

1540
02:49:56,829 --> 02:50:07,233
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there are times when educational leaders hire people and they solicit input, and then based on that input, they may make some decisions.

1541
02:50:07,894 --> 02:50:22,079
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think there are other times where when you're in a leadership position, you do need to make a decision based on what you know about the organization, and you're not necessarily always able to solicit input, but you make that decision based on a level of competence and skill.

1542
02:50:22,740 --> 02:50:25,241
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think sometimes, if you will,

1543
02:50:26,311 --> 02:50:34,257
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I would call it a blind spot, but I think sometimes when you have to make a tough decision and people don't like that decision,

1544
02:50:35,293 --> 02:50:43,495
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you may feel community pressure or pressure from people within the organization to perhaps rethink your decision.

1545
02:50:44,236 --> 02:50:59,600
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think really part of kind of, if you will, trying to address that blind spot or make sure that it doesn't happen, and not to say it won't, but I think about is when you're making a decision is to provide the why and then the who and the what.

1546
02:51:00,300 --> 02:51:01,441
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that's really important.

1547
02:51:01,481 --> 02:51:05,044
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're able to explain the why, I feel like that sometimes helps.

1548
02:51:06,165 --> 02:51:07,487
[SPEAKER_00]: And then look at the who and the what.

1549
02:51:07,687 --> 02:51:11,490
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think that's, excuse me, always the case.

1550
02:51:12,631 --> 02:51:19,517
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I do think that can be difficult when faced with a lot of pressure from the community.

1551
02:51:19,597 --> 02:51:25,042
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you are accountable to the school committee, to administrators, to students, to parents.

1552
02:51:27,049 --> 02:51:33,513
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes those decisions are hard and you feel pressure to maybe either back away or to change your mind.

1553
02:51:34,934 --> 02:51:39,876
[SPEAKER_00]: And that doesn't mean that you aren't reflective and you don't think about your decision.

1554
02:51:40,797 --> 02:51:45,820
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes you may need to move your stake and rethink your decision and or

1555
02:51:49,315 --> 02:51:54,058
[SPEAKER_00]: while you're looking at another vantage point, maybe you discover, based on feedback, something that you didn't discover.

1556
02:51:55,378 --> 02:51:58,160
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that can be hard.

1557
02:51:58,980 --> 02:52:10,526
[SPEAKER_00]: I think another, if you will, a blind spot is to try... Your job is to do the very best that you can to meet the needs of all students and to meet the needs of kids.

1558
02:52:11,487 --> 02:52:13,007
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's first and foremost.

1559
02:52:13,688 --> 02:52:15,909
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will just say, even as a building leader,

1560
02:52:16,314 --> 02:52:23,399
[SPEAKER_00]: it can be very easy to get swayed and taken away from that by lots of other competing things.

1561
02:52:23,759 --> 02:52:35,068
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be an unfunded mandate, it might be something that you're asked to do that perhaps really does not, it kind of takes you away from the focus of teaching and learning.

1562
02:52:36,708 --> 02:52:47,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, I'd like you to tell me about, tell us about a time that you were taking an action, it wasn't quite proper, and you had a mentor adjust your behavior.

1563
02:52:48,355 --> 02:52:51,918
[SPEAKER_03]: And tell us about what led you in the wrong direction, how were you adjusted?

1564
02:52:59,903 --> 02:53:02,064
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I'm trying to think.

1565
02:53:10,620 --> 02:53:17,229
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe not a mentor, but so I've done a lot of work with tiered interventions for students.

1566
02:53:18,270 --> 02:53:26,382
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I will tell you is that sometimes we've tried things that have worked and worked well.

1567
02:53:26,872 --> 02:53:30,695
[SPEAKER_00]: and other times we've kind of entered into some things that maybe didn't quite go well.

1568
02:53:31,436 --> 02:53:41,004
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my current role, I have regularly met with my building union representatives to get feedback from them.

1569
02:53:41,564 --> 02:53:53,014
[SPEAKER_00]: And then oftentimes what I'll do is I'll meet with them, and then I might meet with them before I have a school leadership team that we formed,

1570
02:53:53,414 --> 02:53:57,977
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I may do is I may meet with them, and then I might meet with the school leadership team.

1571
02:53:58,617 --> 02:54:04,160
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if any issues come up, then I'm kind of funneling that through a team that is a representative body of the school.

1572
02:54:04,781 --> 02:54:13,186
[SPEAKER_00]: So there have been some times in some of our work around tiered interventions that we've thought of some ideas that we might try.

1573
02:54:13,206 --> 02:54:20,710
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes my union reps have come back and said to me, look, you may want to consider

1574
02:54:21,950 --> 02:54:24,091
[SPEAKER_00]: the impact this may have on staff.

1575
02:54:25,552 --> 02:54:27,113
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, there have been those times.

1576
02:54:27,273 --> 02:54:30,054
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I said, oh, I didn't think of that.

1577
02:54:30,214 --> 02:54:30,554
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1578
02:54:32,055 --> 02:54:35,036
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm active on social media.

1579
02:54:35,116 --> 02:54:37,297
[SPEAKER_00]: I network with a lot of great educators on Twitter.

1580
02:54:38,157 --> 02:54:41,639
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's been a movement called Observe Me.

1581
02:54:42,139 --> 02:54:44,800
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where a teacher can put a little placard outside of their room

1582
02:54:45,500 --> 02:54:50,521
[SPEAKER_00]: They come up with a couple things that they want people to give them feedback on, and it's similar to a walk-through model.

1583
02:54:50,561 --> 02:55:03,965
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would come, I might go to Mia's classroom, and she's got something on the outside that says, come on in and take a look at how my students do, how I do with transitions, and how my kids do with, let's say, focus and attention.

1584
02:55:04,804 --> 02:55:09,625
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounded like a great way for people to be reflective of their practice.

1585
02:55:09,985 --> 02:55:11,325
[SPEAKER_00]: It was called Observe Me.

1586
02:55:12,105 --> 02:55:20,067
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went to my school leadership team and I said, look, I found this great way for us to participate in some really good feedback loops.

1587
02:55:20,907 --> 02:55:23,148
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get to pick what you want feedback on.

1588
02:55:23,168 --> 02:55:24,968
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, I said, I'm going to do it.

1589
02:55:25,128 --> 02:55:26,288
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to put it outside my office.

1590
02:55:27,949 --> 02:55:28,489
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say.

1591
02:55:30,450 --> 02:55:37,311
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you say observe to teachers, they immediately go to supervision and evaluation.

1592
02:55:38,211 --> 02:55:51,094
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been temporarily suspended for a period of time, not because I don't think it's worthy, but again, and we were looking at doing it in a small scale.

1593
02:55:51,534 --> 02:55:56,674
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes you know that you need to roll something out in a larger scale or systemically.

1594
02:55:57,075 --> 02:55:59,695
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there are other times where you want to, let's say, test something out,

1595
02:56:00,195 --> 02:56:01,796
[SPEAKER_00]: and get some feedback and tweak it.

1596
02:56:02,837 --> 02:56:06,059
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're currently on pause, which observed me.

1597
02:56:06,219 --> 02:56:15,485
[SPEAKER_00]: And those weren't mentors, but I listen to the people that I lead because I'm asking them to do work on behalf of children.

1598
02:56:16,005 --> 02:56:18,007
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes, again, intent and impact.

1599
02:56:19,388 --> 02:56:27,433
[SPEAKER_00]: While I do think people wanted to participate, we need to navigate a way that it's about some different types of learning.

1600
02:56:28,373 --> 02:56:28,673
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1601
02:56:28,934 --> 02:56:29,214
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.

1602
02:56:29,718 --> 02:56:30,498
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. Benedetto.

1603
02:56:30,959 --> 02:56:31,319
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1604
02:56:32,960 --> 02:56:38,622
[SPEAKER_12]: I have a question regarding academic growth for our students here in MedFed.

1605
02:56:38,762 --> 02:56:39,703
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure.

1606
02:56:40,143 --> 02:56:53,129
[SPEAKER_12]: So could you tell me what kind of plans you would put in place for each level of our educational system, like our elementary, our middle, and our high school students, based on any of the data that you had a chance to review?

1607
02:56:53,530 --> 02:56:53,710
Sure.

1608
02:57:02,202 --> 02:57:05,866
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've looked over your MCAS data.

1609
02:57:05,886 --> 02:57:10,752
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked over your school report card and student growth portfolio, your student growth profiles.

1610
02:57:11,873 --> 02:57:15,557
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to be careful about kind of drilling down too specifically.

1611
02:57:15,737 --> 02:57:18,780
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do want you to know that I looked over data for all of your schools.

1612
02:57:18,841 --> 02:57:22,625
[SPEAKER_00]: And I looked over school report cards and accountability levels.

1613
02:57:24,608 --> 02:57:33,236
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will get to the answer about some specifics, but I guess what I would want to share with you is that as a superintendent, part of my role would be to think systemically.

1614
02:57:33,796 --> 02:57:38,621
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my mind, when I come to work each day, I'm thinking about what can I do for all kids.

1615
02:57:39,081 --> 02:57:44,166
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll make sure that I can give you, if you will, some little sound bites about each grade level.

1616
02:57:44,226 --> 02:57:50,591
[SPEAKER_00]: But just thinking about as far as the district goes to raise student achievement and rigor.

1617
02:57:51,632 --> 02:58:08,066
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the things is really around working to either continue to create or maintain or grow a culture of learning where people are focused on student learning.

1618
02:58:09,047 --> 02:58:13,691
[SPEAKER_00]: And that focus really permeates the organization and people believe in that.

1619
02:58:14,171 --> 02:58:18,335
[SPEAKER_00]: That people believe all students can learn and demonstrate growth.

1620
02:58:18,976 --> 02:58:28,976
[SPEAKER_00]: and that educators, all educators, are invested in learning, and that we also work as outreach agents with parents and the community to help them learn as well.

1621
02:58:29,468 --> 02:58:36,130
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think first and foremost, that, you know, there's a saying, and that is that culture eats strategy for breakfast.

1622
02:58:36,730 --> 02:58:41,452
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're really, you're developing a culture around learning.

1623
02:58:42,132 --> 02:58:47,314
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's a key piece that really, if you will, addresses a systemic approach to learning.

1624
02:58:48,234 --> 02:58:54,476
[SPEAKER_00]: The other piece, and I've seen this done, I don't know if the school committee has talked about this,

1625
02:58:54,960 --> 02:59:01,144
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen and read about some very successful districts where the school committee would set a particular goal.

1626
02:59:01,444 --> 02:59:04,046
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was a particular school committee.

1627
02:59:04,106 --> 02:59:04,766
[SPEAKER_00]: They wrote a book.

1628
02:59:05,226 --> 02:59:07,528
[SPEAKER_00]: The book is called Annual Growth, Catch-Up Growth.

1629
02:59:08,248 --> 02:59:10,489
[SPEAKER_00]: And the book was about time on learning.

1630
02:59:11,050 --> 02:59:13,191
[SPEAKER_00]: And the school committee set a particular learning goal.

1631
02:59:13,711 --> 02:59:17,854
[SPEAKER_00]: And that learning goal was that all students would be reading on grade level by the end of third grade.

1632
02:59:19,602 --> 02:59:25,644
[SPEAKER_00]: That, I will tell you, was probably one of the most powerful reads I've had in my career.

1633
02:59:26,464 --> 02:59:35,828
[SPEAKER_00]: It was about focusing resources and time to ensure that kids get what they need and that you're doing some early intervention there.

1634
02:59:36,468 --> 02:59:40,249
[SPEAKER_00]: And that came from the school committee and then permeated its way through.

1635
02:59:41,049 --> 02:59:44,791
[SPEAKER_00]: I think some other things that move learning for all kids,

1636
02:59:46,812 --> 02:59:58,656
[SPEAKER_00]: is that there's a robust curriculum that's engaging and that there's a process around reviewing evaluation, there's a process around evaluating and reviewing curriculum regularly.

1637
02:59:59,236 --> 03:00:06,358
[SPEAKER_00]: So for instance, in my experience, one of the very best ways to help improve learning is by having that great curriculum.

1638
03:00:06,799 --> 03:00:10,880
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're engaging in a curriculum review approximately every three years.

1639
03:00:11,701 --> 03:00:19,884
[SPEAKER_00]: You would enter into, for instance, a curriculum review for reading or English language arts, reading and writing, and it's a three-year review process.

1640
03:00:19,924 --> 03:00:24,046
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you're done with that, you would then move to science, and you would do a three-year review.

1641
03:00:24,166 --> 03:00:27,407
[SPEAKER_00]: You would then move to maybe math.

1642
03:00:27,887 --> 03:00:39,792
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's a way to boost student achievement, because as you're doing that work, you're looking at the relevance of curriculum, engagement, maybe you're looking

1643
03:00:40,618 --> 03:00:50,365
[SPEAKER_00]: excuse me, to do something like project-based learning, which may integrate different types of learning into a project for students, you're also looking at your assessments at the same time.

1644
03:00:50,545 --> 03:00:53,747
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a very robust way to get movement.

1645
03:00:55,309 --> 03:01:01,393
[SPEAKER_00]: The other piece, and this is what I will share with you in regards to elementary and middle and high school,

1646
03:01:02,113 --> 03:01:10,635
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is that it is absolutely imperative that schools and districts build tiered systems of support for students.

1647
03:01:11,315 --> 03:01:17,217
[SPEAKER_00]: So for instance, at my school, every six weeks, I meet with teacher teams.

1648
03:01:17,337 --> 03:01:19,297
[SPEAKER_00]: I meet with every grade level for two hours.

1649
03:01:19,917 --> 03:01:21,698
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're combing over data for students.

1650
03:01:22,398 --> 03:01:25,900
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not just, you know, Johnny is at a DRA level 24.

1651
03:01:25,980 --> 03:01:34,385
[SPEAKER_00]: The conversation is this student is at this particular level, and here's where I'm seeing them struggle.

1652
03:01:34,585 --> 03:01:40,349
[SPEAKER_00]: So teachers know kids, and we're talking about students, and we're talking about what interventions we'll put in place for them.

1653
03:01:41,910 --> 03:01:49,334
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just say tiered systems of support and building in intervention and doing the work around RTI, response to intervention,

1654
03:01:50,277 --> 03:01:53,819
[SPEAKER_00]: is oftentimes a little bit easier at the elementary level.

1655
03:01:54,059 --> 03:01:57,520
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a bit more challenging at middle schools and high schools.

1656
03:01:58,160 --> 03:02:01,401
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I've seen people successfully do it.

1657
03:02:02,042 --> 03:02:06,604
[SPEAKER_00]: So our middle schools have been working to build in a block of time during the day.

1658
03:02:08,390 --> 03:02:13,551
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're listening right now, they'll, I don't know if this is televised, but they'll, I feel like they stole our name for it.

1659
03:02:13,571 --> 03:02:16,052
[SPEAKER_00]: We call it WIN time, and WIN stands for what I need.

1660
03:02:16,632 --> 03:02:22,973
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that means that some students are getting interventions for those kids that need it, and some kids are getting extensions.

1661
03:02:23,953 --> 03:02:30,435
[SPEAKER_00]: At the high school, they've worked to try to roll up some of the work we've done at the elementary level into a block that they call iBlock.

1662
03:02:30,955 --> 03:02:34,436
[SPEAKER_00]: And that iBlock is a time where students can go to teachers for extra help.

1663
03:02:35,336 --> 03:02:50,995
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, if you're thinking about raising student achievement, I'm not an educator that believes that, you know, a student should not be getting to the end of a quarter or a marking period with a failing grade and they're just finding out or parents are finding out.

1664
03:02:51,806 --> 03:02:59,509
[SPEAKER_00]: The minute a student is showing that they're not being successful, we should be intervening on their behalf and we should be providing support to help them.

1665
03:03:00,149 --> 03:03:10,954
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of the day, I will just say, it's not because you're looking to get a good MCAS score, it's because you're helping kids meet learning standards that will help them when they leave the school community that they're in.

1666
03:03:11,654 --> 03:03:19,159
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, ideally, you have very robust curriculum that you've developed with teacher input and you've aligned to curriculum frameworks.

1667
03:03:20,040 --> 03:03:24,383
[SPEAKER_00]: You provide resources and professional development to deliver that curriculum.

1668
03:03:25,168 --> 03:03:36,495
[SPEAKER_00]: For students that don't meet the benchmarks, you're providing tiered systems of support to help them, and then the outcome should be high levels of learning and improvements in learning.

1669
03:03:37,016 --> 03:03:46,702
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and by the way, your hope is, and not your hope, but what should happen is that students should do well on standardized tests or other measures of performance.

1670
03:03:49,380 --> 03:03:50,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Follow up, Mr. Oshiro?

1671
03:03:51,002 --> 03:03:53,525
[SPEAKER_03]: You used the phrase robust curriculum.

1672
03:03:53,966 --> 03:03:55,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you explain what that means exactly?

1673
03:03:56,248 --> 03:03:56,409
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

1674
03:03:58,311 --> 03:04:07,475
[SPEAKER_00]: I think robust curriculum and teaching robust lessons, you're really thinking about entry points for lots of different types of learners.

1675
03:04:08,355 --> 03:04:23,361
[SPEAKER_00]: So a prime example is that over the last few years, I've been working with my math coach and we've really placed a huge emphasis on helping students see themselves as mathematicians.

1676
03:04:24,221 --> 03:04:25,682
[SPEAKER_00]: So a robust curriculum

1677
03:04:26,249 --> 03:04:28,830
[SPEAKER_00]: offers opportunities for lots of different learners.

1678
03:04:29,051 --> 03:04:33,793
[SPEAKER_00]: So for instance, we do what are called low floor and high ceiling tasks.

1679
03:04:34,293 --> 03:04:41,077
[SPEAKER_00]: And those tasks are intended to provide multiple insertion points for many different types of learners.

1680
03:04:41,997 --> 03:04:44,539
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've shown parents some of these activities.

1681
03:04:45,919 --> 03:04:50,602
[SPEAKER_00]: So you create an activity where you may have four symbols

1682
03:04:51,038 --> 03:04:56,581
[SPEAKER_00]: and you ask students in a math class, what do you notice, what do you wonder?

1683
03:04:57,861 --> 03:04:58,982
[SPEAKER_00]: All kids can engage in that.

1684
03:04:59,802 --> 03:05:08,546
[SPEAKER_00]: It may not look like mathematical learning as some people may know it, performing an algorithm, but it's those robust, kind of, if you will, curricular experiences.

1685
03:05:09,426 --> 03:05:16,429
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, when I think about robust experiences, you know, I think we gravitate towards lots of classic literature.

1686
03:05:16,990 --> 03:05:19,571
[SPEAKER_00]: Ernest Hemingway and, you know,

1687
03:05:21,052 --> 03:05:24,074
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we thinking about texts that reflect the kids that are in front of us?

1688
03:05:25,315 --> 03:05:29,298
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we, Medford is a diverse community.

1689
03:05:30,299 --> 03:05:36,643
[SPEAKER_00]: And many of our communities, urban communities, suburban communities, maybe not as much so, but urban communities are diverse.

1690
03:05:37,084 --> 03:05:46,711
[SPEAKER_00]: So a robust curriculum thinks about, for instance, when they're selecting literature for kids to read, what might help reflect lots of different students.

1691
03:05:48,868 --> 03:05:49,248
[SPEAKER_11]: Very good.

1692
03:05:49,488 --> 03:05:49,848
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1693
03:05:50,529 --> 03:05:50,689
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

1694
03:05:50,729 --> 03:05:51,069
[SPEAKER_11]: Kreatz?

1695
03:05:53,350 --> 03:05:53,550
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi.

1696
03:05:53,870 --> 03:05:54,411
[SPEAKER_09]: How you doing?

1697
03:05:54,431 --> 03:05:54,471
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

1698
03:05:58,973 --> 03:06:15,181
[SPEAKER_09]: How would you work with the school administration to continue to promote career and technical education, increase the enrollment numbers, and keep the students here at Medford High School participating in career and technical education?

1699
03:06:16,462 --> 03:06:16,762
[SPEAKER_00]: Surely.

1700
03:06:18,257 --> 03:06:29,634
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will just say I think part of promoting that, if you will, and I understand we're in the education business, but there is a bit of marketing, if you will.

1701
03:06:30,295 --> 03:06:31,417
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of that marketing

1702
03:06:33,482 --> 03:06:34,142
[SPEAKER_00]: or promotion.

1703
03:06:35,643 --> 03:06:37,043
[SPEAKER_00]: Promotion is probably the better word.

1704
03:06:37,063 --> 03:06:40,324
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like marketing sounds like you're trying to sell something that maybe isn't great.

1705
03:06:40,444 --> 03:06:49,567
[SPEAKER_00]: But in any case, that promotion really starts with children when they're young and helping kids explore interests that they have.

1706
03:06:50,767 --> 03:06:55,549
[SPEAKER_00]: which may not necessarily be what might be considered a normal path.

1707
03:06:55,749 --> 03:07:01,010
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would share with you my path was not to be an educational leader.

1708
03:07:01,510 --> 03:07:03,271
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I was going to own my own restaurant.

1709
03:07:05,151 --> 03:07:10,693
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I went to college and the first time I went to college I was not successful.

1710
03:07:11,693 --> 03:07:13,034
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I made it about two months.

1711
03:07:14,025 --> 03:07:24,348
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll just say, I wish I knew then what I know now about, if you will, some grit and resilience, because I felt like I was maybe a little bit low.

1712
03:07:25,697 --> 03:07:32,760
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, I'm thinking about promoting opportunities around learning for kids when they're young.

1713
03:07:33,601 --> 03:07:39,283
[SPEAKER_00]: So had somebody promoted something different for me at a younger age, I may have taken, let's say, a different path.

1714
03:07:40,064 --> 03:07:46,967
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think promoting that in the younger grades, I feel like providing students an opportunity to see what that looks like.

1715
03:07:47,867 --> 03:07:54,170
[SPEAKER_00]: So for instance, I think kids should see what is career and technical education

1716
03:07:55,188 --> 03:07:56,689
[SPEAKER_00]: And do they understand what it is?

1717
03:07:57,390 --> 03:08:02,514
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think if kids don't see it, they may have misperceptions.

1718
03:08:02,894 --> 03:08:05,276
[SPEAKER_00]: They may not know what pathways that they have.

1719
03:08:05,797 --> 03:08:14,204
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think by fostering interest for kids when they're younger, I think also providing opportunities for parents in the community to get in and see the program.

1720
03:08:14,904 --> 03:08:15,785
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that's key.

1721
03:08:17,347 --> 03:08:21,250
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's not only key to help people educate, be educated about the program,

1722
03:08:22,042 --> 03:08:34,165
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you were then to make a change for the program, or if you then do something in the budget where you're asking people for increased funding or a change, people then understand the program and are able to support it.

1723
03:08:35,046 --> 03:08:37,786
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like there's the community promotion piece.

1724
03:08:38,847 --> 03:08:45,229
[SPEAKER_00]: I also feel like you're doing work with kids at a young age around exploring interests, vocational interests as well.

1725
03:08:47,065 --> 03:08:54,890
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we talk to kids a lot about going to college, and I don't know that we always promote the career readiness, which may also lead to college.

1726
03:08:55,730 --> 03:09:03,755
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was fortunate, and I had some drive, and I chose a different path, and I went back to school.

1727
03:09:05,516 --> 03:09:10,439
[SPEAKER_00]: And I might have had a different outcome had I had a career and technical opportunity afforded to me.

1728
03:09:11,684 --> 03:09:12,044
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1729
03:09:12,284 --> 03:09:12,684
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.

1730
03:09:12,704 --> 03:09:16,646
[SPEAKER_11]: If you could go before the Board of Education tomorrow and advocate for a change, what would you be talking about?

1731
03:09:32,785 --> 03:09:34,366
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's what I would share with you.

1732
03:09:36,948 --> 03:09:43,874
[SPEAKER_00]: In my school now, I have the good fortune of having a district-wide special education program.

1733
03:09:44,715 --> 03:09:47,877
[SPEAKER_00]: And that program serves students on the autism spectrum.

1734
03:09:48,538 --> 03:09:50,539
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very, very large program.

1735
03:09:51,360 --> 03:09:52,761
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like a school within a school.

1736
03:09:53,081 --> 03:10:00,828
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have almost 40 students in the program, and every one of those students comes with a one-on-one aid.

1737
03:10:01,587 --> 03:10:03,148
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a very heavily staffed program.

1738
03:10:04,989 --> 03:10:07,971
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it comes with a lot of supports.

1739
03:10:08,812 --> 03:10:20,240
[SPEAKER_00]: And for those students, what happens is that when they enter in third and fourth and fifth grade, they have the opportunity to take MCAS.

1740
03:10:21,100 --> 03:10:28,526
[SPEAKER_00]: And so some of the students, based on the nature of their disability, may be able to participate in regular MCAS.

1741
03:10:29,608 --> 03:10:35,189
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some students complete what we call an MCAS Alt, an alternative portfolio to demonstrate learning.

1742
03:10:36,069 --> 03:10:44,951
[SPEAKER_00]: So you would think that an alternative portfolio shows learning in an alternate way, but still demonstrates work towards the standards.

1743
03:10:45,931 --> 03:10:57,414
[SPEAKER_00]: So what has, if you will, bothered me since I've been in Massachusetts, so when a student is identified as a student taking the alternate assessment on MCAS,

1744
03:10:58,524 --> 03:11:04,425
[SPEAKER_00]: right out of the gate, they can only get a score of warning and can get no higher score.

1745
03:11:05,765 --> 03:11:12,367
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, they can still earn the full number of CPI points that go towards school accountability.

1746
03:11:14,227 --> 03:11:25,349
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good, but what I really wrestle with is about a parent's perception about their child, who may be already

1747
03:11:25,973 --> 03:11:36,685
[SPEAKER_00]: be at a disadvantage based on a significant disability, and then to get a score back from a portfolio that, by the way, one portfolio takes almost 40 hours to compile.

1748
03:11:37,626 --> 03:11:41,450
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, for instance, I think a year ago, we submitted 11 portfolios.

1749
03:11:43,564 --> 03:12:05,724
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the other thing with that is that kind of, if you will, on the public side, when your very public accountability scores go out, your MCAS scores, what happens is people, if you have a district-wide program, people are seeing a lot of warnings because those alts are warning right out of the gate.

1750
03:12:06,184 --> 03:12:08,326
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be advocating that the

1751
03:12:10,219 --> 03:12:29,654
[SPEAKER_00]: that the Board of Education work with the commissioner and those folks who have developed MCAS and school accountability ratings to be looking at ways to still capture growth for those students, but doing it in a more meaningful way that really still provides those kids some integrity.

1752
03:12:30,895 --> 03:12:37,841
[SPEAKER_00]: And I probably, I know maybe I'll get in trouble for saying this, but I have suspected that there's some, if you will,

1753
03:12:38,277 --> 03:12:47,462
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels to me like a civil rights issue that students are getting a score of warning right out of the gate and can't get anything higher than that.

1754
03:12:47,902 --> 03:12:50,284
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, that's disheartening for the kids.

1755
03:12:50,464 --> 03:12:51,565
[SPEAKER_00]: That's at the end of the day.

1756
03:12:52,465 --> 03:12:58,929
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have a higher percentage of warning on a public MCAS, what goes out to the public, I'm happy to share with them.

1757
03:12:59,089 --> 03:13:03,691
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, I'm first and foremost concerned with students, not about what the public score looks like.

1758
03:13:04,032 --> 03:13:04,372
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1759
03:13:04,772 --> 03:13:05,112
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.

1760
03:13:05,933 --> 03:13:06,313
[SPEAKER_07]: Sarusa?

1761
03:13:09,461 --> 03:13:15,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes I feel like the more I learn, the less happy I am.

1762
03:13:17,385 --> 03:13:20,846
[SPEAKER_04]: How does recess fit into a school system under your leadership?

1763
03:13:22,127 --> 03:13:28,069
[SPEAKER_00]: So I work in a school district where we have a policy that says kids get recess every day.

1764
03:13:28,349 --> 03:13:29,830
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in policy.

1765
03:13:30,951 --> 03:13:34,192
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a policy that says you do not take recess away from children.

1766
03:13:35,252 --> 03:13:36,373
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe in that policy.

1767
03:13:37,302 --> 03:13:38,483
[SPEAKER_00]: And for a couple of reasons.

1768
03:13:39,524 --> 03:13:44,047
[SPEAKER_00]: So early on in my career, I was a teacher.

1769
03:13:45,067 --> 03:13:53,433
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like, you know, when I've talked to you about being the lead learner, I'm somebody who learns.

1770
03:13:54,254 --> 03:13:58,056
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I will tell you, early on in my career, I did what many other teachers do.

1771
03:13:58,497 --> 03:14:03,240
[SPEAKER_00]: And a very easy thing to do if you have to provide a consequence to a student is to take away recess.

1772
03:14:05,566 --> 03:14:10,288
[SPEAKER_00]: As I kind of grew as an educator, I learned a lot about logical consequences.

1773
03:14:10,508 --> 03:14:12,688
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you break something, you fix it.

1774
03:14:13,289 --> 03:14:23,232
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know, the issue is what happens is that oftentimes taking away recess for students is a quick and easy go-to for teachers in trying to address a problem.

1775
03:14:23,732 --> 03:14:31,555
[SPEAKER_00]: But if there's not a connection, so if I've done something in class that's inappropriate and you take away recess, I guess what's the learning for me?

1776
03:14:31,695 --> 03:14:34,616
[SPEAKER_00]: Because quite honestly, recess is an aside.

1777
03:14:36,492 --> 03:14:48,396
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also, I will say I'm also a fan of restorative discipline practices, and that's where you're working with students to help identify what they've done and how to repair that or fix it.

1778
03:14:49,056 --> 03:14:51,016
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's really where kind of growth comes.

1779
03:14:52,477 --> 03:14:55,097
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes out of what would you do differently?

1780
03:14:55,618 --> 03:14:56,498
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you show empathy?

1781
03:14:56,598 --> 03:14:58,338
[SPEAKER_00]: How did the situation play out?

1782
03:14:58,358 --> 03:15:01,519
[SPEAKER_00]: I think those are all pieces around learning and discipline.

1783
03:15:01,599 --> 03:15:04,180
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is, if you will,

1784
03:15:05,366 --> 03:15:09,007
[SPEAKER_00]: very easy to not really have a bag of tricks and to say, I'm gonna take recess away.

1785
03:15:09,907 --> 03:15:16,729
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing is, I don't know who said it, but there's a quote that says, play is the work of children.

1786
03:15:17,809 --> 03:15:27,892
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there have been a lot of research studies around the importance of play with kids and the learning that takes place during play.

1787
03:15:29,252 --> 03:15:33,273
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll just share with you along the lines of recess and play,

1788
03:15:34,228 --> 03:15:45,296
[SPEAKER_00]: So about, not this year, a year ago, I saw somewhere in my Twitter feed that there was a movement called Global School Play Day.

1789
03:15:45,917 --> 03:15:48,639
[SPEAKER_00]: And schools could sign up for it or districts could sign up for it.

1790
03:15:49,219 --> 03:15:51,881
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could take as little or as much as you would like.

1791
03:15:52,902 --> 03:15:59,166
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes I like to, if you will, rip the Band-Aid slowly, and sometimes I like to give it a good pull.

1792
03:15:59,307 --> 03:16:01,088
[SPEAKER_00]: So I decided to really rip the Band-Aid

1793
03:16:01,718 --> 03:16:05,321
[SPEAKER_00]: we chose to participate in Global School Play Day at my school for the full day.

1794
03:16:06,202 --> 03:16:08,244
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's what I would share with you.

1795
03:16:08,745 --> 03:16:14,190
[SPEAKER_00]: We did one full day of undirected play for kids.

1796
03:16:15,010 --> 03:16:20,315
[SPEAKER_00]: If a student had an IEP, we still ensured that they got any services associated with their IEP.

1797
03:16:20,836 --> 03:16:26,381
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't miss lunch, they didn't miss recess, and they still went to their specialist classes, art, music, library.

1798
03:16:27,785 --> 03:16:32,166
[SPEAKER_00]: students could not bring in electronics, so we didn't want any electronic devices.

1799
03:16:32,626 --> 03:16:35,827
[SPEAKER_00]: We gave them the whole day to participate in creative play.

1800
03:16:35,847 --> 03:16:40,468
[SPEAKER_00]: They got to bring in games, toys, kids brought in blankets, they were making forts.

1801
03:16:41,488 --> 03:16:49,470
[SPEAKER_00]: The teachers shared with me that that was one of the most amazing days that they had had, and I will tell you

1802
03:16:50,590 --> 03:16:58,493
[SPEAKER_00]: For some of our students with significant disability, students in our ILP program, teachers saw those kids interact with their peers in different ways.

1803
03:16:58,994 --> 03:17:01,234
[SPEAKER_00]: Kids were negotiating turn-taking.

1804
03:17:01,675 --> 03:17:03,555
[SPEAKER_00]: They were negotiating creative play.

1805
03:17:04,636 --> 03:17:06,016
[SPEAKER_00]: Who will lead the game?

1806
03:17:06,116 --> 03:17:07,877
[SPEAKER_00]: Who will help?

1807
03:17:08,697 --> 03:17:10,518
[SPEAKER_00]: It was absolutely amazing.

1808
03:17:11,278 --> 03:17:17,801
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember a student walking out, and the student, as they got out near the front lobby, said to me,

1809
03:17:18,581 --> 03:17:22,123
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Marloni, this was the best day of my life.

1810
03:17:23,044 --> 03:17:25,705
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought, well, you're only 10, so I hope you have many more.

1811
03:17:26,125 --> 03:17:32,749
[SPEAKER_00]: But in any case, I will tell you though, this is my 24th year in education.

1812
03:17:33,010 --> 03:17:38,213
[SPEAKER_00]: 23 years ago, if you said to me, Tom, should you be giving kids a full day of play?

1813
03:17:39,093 --> 03:17:39,734
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we can't.

1814
03:17:40,374 --> 03:17:47,078
[SPEAKER_00]: Teachers are under great scrutiny to help children achieve standards of performance.

1815
03:17:48,010 --> 03:17:57,175
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think sometimes we don't stop to think about the opportunities that we need to be providing our children recess, having time for some unstructured play.

1816
03:17:57,835 --> 03:17:59,956
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I think we need to help kids navigate recess?

1817
03:18:00,256 --> 03:18:00,476
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

1818
03:18:01,077 --> 03:18:07,640
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there are times we're doing some of that teaching, some of that incidental teaching that helps recess be successful for kids.

1819
03:18:08,480 --> 03:18:09,261
[SPEAKER_00]: I support recess.

1820
03:18:09,401 --> 03:18:10,801
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't support in taking it away.

1821
03:18:12,622 --> 03:18:15,564
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have to balance that with we need to have time on learning too.

1822
03:18:16,801 --> 03:18:17,662
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always a balance.

1823
03:18:18,303 --> 03:18:18,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1824
03:18:18,864 --> 03:18:19,404
[SPEAKER_11]: Very good.

1825
03:18:19,805 --> 03:18:22,167
[SPEAKER_11]: The final question of the night, if Sebastian has one.

1826
03:18:22,187 --> 03:18:24,109
[SPEAKER_11]: Or are you all set?

1827
03:18:25,051 --> 03:18:26,352
[SPEAKER_11]: You're all set.

1828
03:18:27,093 --> 03:18:30,296
[SPEAKER_11]: Justin, final question.

1829
03:18:33,871 --> 03:18:39,013
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of focus is given to the core subjects that are tested, English, math, science.

1830
03:18:41,174 --> 03:19:00,322
[SPEAKER_01]: How would you balance the importance of getting high scores and devoting resources to those subjects and to other subjects that a lot of people don't consider core subjects, such as foreign language and various classes and extracurricular activities like sports and arts and music?

1831
03:19:02,057 --> 03:19:05,540
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess I will just tell you, I believe all subjects are core subjects.

1832
03:19:05,840 --> 03:19:07,822
[SPEAKER_00]: If they were not important, we wouldn't have them.

1833
03:19:08,262 --> 03:19:10,584
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they're not meaningful, why are we giving them to kids?

1834
03:19:11,465 --> 03:19:23,075
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're perhaps, I think they don't get as much attention, for instance, as math and reading and writing, because we're very, if you will, hyper-focused on kids leaving with a set of skills that we know that they have to have.

1835
03:19:23,275 --> 03:19:25,177
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I would tell you is that

1836
03:19:25,757 --> 03:19:30,400
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there are skills outside of those core content areas that kids need to have.

1837
03:19:31,000 --> 03:19:37,223
[SPEAKER_00]: I think about kids being well-rounded and maybe finding a love or an interest in the arts.

1838
03:19:37,724 --> 03:19:43,147
[SPEAKER_00]: I think for kids it may be around a language or for other kids, extracurricular activities.

1839
03:19:44,187 --> 03:19:51,231
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, you know, I talked about schools developing systems of tiered intervention for academic success.

1840
03:19:51,731 --> 03:19:57,014
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess I just, I want to answer your question but kind of pivot back to Mrs. DiBenedetto's question.

1841
03:19:57,534 --> 03:20:06,899
[SPEAKER_00]: So in thinking about raising the success level of all kids, you know, what you don't hear about and what's not measured on MCAS or put in the newspaper,

1842
03:20:07,663 --> 03:20:14,754
[SPEAKER_00]: are how many kids do well in a foreign language, or how many kids successfully get through a music class or an art class.

1843
03:20:15,314 --> 03:20:18,419
[SPEAKER_00]: There should be systems and structures in place in schools.

1844
03:20:18,439 --> 03:20:20,802
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I talk about tiered systems of intervention,

1845
03:20:23,506 --> 03:20:34,863
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in the music department and you're a group of teachers, that you're looking at kids that are either one, maybe at risk, maybe they're not performing well in those classes, or maybe they don't really seem to be engaged.

1846
03:20:35,404 --> 03:20:38,549
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're not engaged, I guess the first place I would start is,

1847
03:20:39,435 --> 03:20:41,396
[SPEAKER_00]: What have I not done?

1848
03:20:41,836 --> 03:20:46,299
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I say I, the person can say that as a representative of the district.

1849
03:20:46,419 --> 03:20:47,740
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the curriculum not engaging?

1850
03:20:47,760 --> 03:20:49,120
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I need to teach this differently?

1851
03:20:49,541 --> 03:20:55,964
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we're always looking at student performance and how we can help kids be successful.

1852
03:20:56,784 --> 03:20:58,405
[SPEAKER_00]: And that goes to sports and coaching.

1853
03:20:58,866 --> 03:21:01,107
[SPEAKER_00]: Are coaches a positive influence?

1854
03:21:01,507 --> 03:21:04,729
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they place reasonable expectations on students?

1855
03:21:05,209 --> 03:21:05,909
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think

1856
03:21:07,580 --> 03:21:11,382
[SPEAKER_00]: in sports, kind of like in MCAS, sometimes we can get focused on winning and outcomes.

1857
03:21:11,762 --> 03:21:24,127
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think sometimes the focus is, should the focus be on camaraderie and on sportsmanship, and if you win, that's great, but winning isn't always the outcome.

1858
03:21:25,648 --> 03:21:25,928
[SPEAKER_11]: Very good.

1859
03:21:26,628 --> 03:21:28,789
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, thank you so much for being here this evening.

1860
03:21:29,190 --> 03:21:33,011
[SPEAKER_11]: If you'd like to offer closing statements, we'd certainly like to listen to those.

1861
03:21:33,031 --> 03:21:33,752
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, sure.

1862
03:21:34,312 --> 03:21:35,852
[SPEAKER_00]: This is brief, I promise you.

1863
03:21:41,260 --> 03:21:42,321
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am a planner.

1864
03:21:42,461 --> 03:21:44,702
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I will tell you, I made sure I came in.

1865
03:21:46,764 --> 03:21:47,964
[SPEAKER_00]: What I would share with you is this.

1866
03:21:49,625 --> 03:21:51,787
[SPEAKER_00]: First and foremost, I just want to thank you for the opportunity to be here.

1867
03:21:55,589 --> 03:22:03,494
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that a superintendent's ability to execute multiple priorities is a key factor in the success of a school system.

1868
03:22:04,175 --> 03:22:04,695
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that.

1869
03:22:05,683 --> 03:22:16,772
[SPEAKER_00]: As superintendent, I will be a role model for exceptional listening skills, strong communication, and having a focus on learning.

1870
03:22:17,773 --> 03:22:27,841
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would just put out to you, while being a resident in the Medford community I understand is not a qualification for the position, the fact that I've chosen to make my home in Medford

1871
03:22:29,028 --> 03:22:38,096
[SPEAKER_00]: and I've lived here for almost a decade, I believe shows that I am in fact invested in and I'm committed to and I care about the community.

1872
03:22:38,796 --> 03:22:41,058
[SPEAKER_00]: I did have a choice of where I could live and I chose Medford.

1873
03:22:42,279 --> 03:22:49,806
[SPEAKER_00]: And should I be given the opportunity to be your next superintendent of schools, I would be making that same commitment to your schools.

1874
03:22:50,387 --> 03:22:53,830
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thank you for your time tonight and for letting me share a little bit about my work.

1875
03:22:54,450 --> 03:22:54,891
[SPEAKER_11]: We thank you.

1876
03:22:59,922 --> 03:23:03,043
[SPEAKER_00]: I did, I can leave them with you, Mayor Burke.

1877
03:23:03,164 --> 03:23:15,028
[SPEAKER_00]: I did, because a lot of my career has been focused K to six, and because you can only, quite honestly, fit so much on a resume, I have had a lot of district leadership experiences.

1878
03:23:15,809 --> 03:23:19,170
[SPEAKER_00]: What I've done is I did bring a one page.

1879
03:23:19,891 --> 03:23:21,871
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got enough copies for folks on the school committee.

1880
03:23:22,231 --> 03:23:23,692
[SPEAKER_00]: If I could leave those with yours.

1881
03:23:23,852 --> 03:23:26,673
[SPEAKER_00]: If people have further questions, they might gather some other information there.

1882
03:23:26,953 --> 03:23:27,614
[SPEAKER_11]: Excellent, thank you.
