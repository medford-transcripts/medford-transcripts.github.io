1
00:00:00,491 --> 00:00:06,474
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, I am calling to the meeting of Medford's community preservation committee.

2
00:00:07,395 --> 00:00:14,618
[SPEAKER_09]: On Tuesday, October 8th, 2024, 630 PM, we are meeting hybrid.

3
00:00:15,079 --> 00:00:22,983
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of us are located at the Department of Public Works building, 21 James Street, and some of us are meeting via Zoom.

4
00:00:24,706 --> 00:00:31,210
[SPEAKER_09]: And the meeting will be recorded and made available as quickly as possible after the meeting.

5
00:00:32,031 --> 00:00:34,452
[SPEAKER_09]: So, with that, thank you to everybody who is here.

6
00:00:34,472 --> 00:00:37,174
[SPEAKER_09]: I apologize to everyone who is in the room with me.

7
00:00:37,194 --> 00:00:44,258
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of a very strange setup where the camera and the screen are here and you're all behind me.

8
00:00:44,438 --> 00:00:46,379
[SPEAKER_09]: So I apologize for my back.

9
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:56,715
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I, the 1st order business will make this the last order of business to review the meeting minutes from the September 10 meetings.

10
00:00:56,775 --> 00:00:59,237
[SPEAKER_09]: So we can jump right into talking with the.

11
00:00:59,817 --> 00:01:02,419
[SPEAKER_09]: The people who come here to give their presentations.

12
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,081
[SPEAKER_09]: So, the, the.

13
00:01:05,802 --> 00:01:08,904
[SPEAKER_09]: The presentation just to give a format for everybody who hasn't.

14
00:01:09,484 --> 00:01:12,266
[SPEAKER_09]: Attended these meetings before we have.

15
00:01:15,305 --> 00:01:18,807
[SPEAKER_09]: Many applications this funding round, so we've broken them into 2.

16
00:01:21,149 --> 00:01:24,471
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to be seeing the presentations over 2 different evenings.

17
00:01:25,131 --> 00:01:31,215
[SPEAKER_09]: So, half of you are here this time and half of you will be coming to the meeting in a couple of weeks.

18
00:01:32,275 --> 00:01:43,742
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're so each person is going to each person who's presenting this evening is going to give about a 3 to 5 minute presentation, followed by.

19
00:01:44,621 --> 00:01:49,203
[SPEAKER_09]: by Q&A with committee members.

20
00:01:49,783 --> 00:01:53,205
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's what the format is going to look like.

21
00:01:54,145 --> 00:02:07,591
[SPEAKER_09]: Just as a follow-up, after we have these two meetings to hear all of the presentations, the next step is that the committee is going to meet again in November, December,

22
00:02:08,151 --> 00:02:31,137
[SPEAKER_09]: to deliberate on which are the projects we're going to recommend funding for, what are the conditions that we might place on these funding recommendations, and then this committee's recommendations are going to be sent to City Council, who has to approve

23
00:02:31,814 --> 00:02:36,416
[SPEAKER_09]: the funding recommendations, and then the grants are awarded.

24
00:02:37,137 --> 00:02:39,658
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's what the process looks like all together.

25
00:02:39,678 --> 00:02:48,823
[SPEAKER_09]: And with that preamble, I'll just invite our first applicant to come and introduce their project.

26
00:02:48,923 --> 00:02:54,866
[SPEAKER_09]: That looks like it's Amanda Centrello going to talk with us about the Riverside Plaza shade structure.

27
00:02:54,886 --> 00:02:56,367
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

28
00:02:57,995 --> 00:02:58,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Roberta.

29
00:02:58,795 --> 00:02:59,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, everyone.

30
00:02:59,856 --> 00:03:04,538
[SPEAKER_04]: I know most of y'all, but for those who don't, I'm Amanda Centrella.

31
00:03:04,638 --> 00:03:07,880
[SPEAKER_04]: I work in the city's Planning, Development and Sustainability Office.

32
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:15,883
[SPEAKER_04]: And if it's okay with y'all, I'd love to share my screen just to give you guys some visuals as we talk.

33
00:03:15,944 --> 00:03:16,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

34
00:03:16,344 --> 00:03:16,924
[SPEAKER_07]: That you did.

35
00:03:16,964 --> 00:03:17,224
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool.

36
00:03:17,244 --> 00:03:18,925
[SPEAKER_07]: So get myself oriented here.

37
00:03:19,005 --> 00:03:19,105
[SPEAKER_05]: And

38
00:03:30,563 --> 00:03:32,406
[SPEAKER_05]: There we go.

39
00:03:33,367 --> 00:03:33,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Alrighty.

40
00:03:34,108 --> 00:03:38,313
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, first application I'd like to talk about is Riverside Plaza.

41
00:03:40,556 --> 00:03:49,006
[SPEAKER_04]: So this application is the scope of which is to cover a couple of things envisioned for the plaza.

42
00:03:49,666 --> 00:04:08,794
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to give a rough overview, it would include a water fountain slash bottle filler to be installed in the plaza, as well as shade sales to create some shaded areas in the existing patio area and some decking, low decking to go over an adjacent lawn area.

43
00:04:08,834 --> 00:04:11,495
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll show you guys some pictures just to kind of orient ourselves.

44
00:04:12,655 --> 00:04:20,786
[SPEAKER_04]: We applied for a state park grant and we were just told, I think, maybe a week or 2 ago that we were awarded that grant, which is really exciting.

45
00:04:21,567 --> 00:04:27,114
[SPEAKER_04]: So this application is for CPA funding to act as match to that awarded grant.

46
00:04:29,683 --> 00:04:32,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to orient ourselves, here is the existing plaza.

47
00:04:32,404 --> 00:04:34,004
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually a very lovely space.

48
00:04:34,124 --> 00:04:39,386
[SPEAKER_04]: It is used all the time by folks, especially in the shoulder seasons of the year when it's a bit more temperate.

49
00:04:40,406 --> 00:04:55,370
[SPEAKER_04]: But what we are proposing to do to add to the site is to address an issue that we've observed in particular during the summer, which is that as constructed, there is not a lot of shade or really any shade within the existing patio area of the plaza.

50
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:57,371
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can see my cursor over here.

51
00:04:58,672 --> 00:05:09,118
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what folks will do, understandably, is move the mobile chairs and seats into this adjacent lawn area over here that has some mature tree canopy.

52
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:12,120
[SPEAKER_04]: So a couple of pictures.

53
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:18,803
[SPEAKER_04]: This is on the left, the lawn area that I was referring to, where folks oftentimes are moving seats to sit.

54
00:05:19,704 --> 00:05:22,926
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's on the right, the existing patio.

55
00:05:26,369 --> 00:05:40,279
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have a couple of treatments in mind, as I mentioned on the left hand side, the shade sales, which would cover part, but not all of the Plaza, because it's also very nice to be able to sit out in the sun on the more temperate parts of the year.

56
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:43,241
[SPEAKER_04]: So spring and fall, which we see a lot of people do.

57
00:05:45,063 --> 00:05:58,718
[SPEAKER_04]: And we are considering or applying for funding to provide a low deck, which would solve a couple of problems that we've noticed in the way that people use the adjacent lawn space.

58
00:05:58,918 --> 00:06:00,200
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll get into that in a second.

59
00:06:01,902 --> 00:06:04,804
[SPEAKER_04]: just a little bit closer up on sort of where the shade cells are.

60
00:06:04,824 --> 00:06:06,886
[SPEAKER_04]: These are concept drawings.

61
00:06:06,926 --> 00:06:11,991
[SPEAKER_04]: This application is for, would go towards both final designs.

62
00:06:12,711 --> 00:06:20,137
[SPEAKER_04]: So we would have an opportunity to sort of refine and finesse designs a bit, and then also implementations of construction.

63
00:06:21,999 --> 00:06:25,442
[SPEAKER_04]: And just sort of a concept rendering of what those shade cells could look like.

64
00:06:27,764 --> 00:06:29,005
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the deck area.

65
00:06:31,172 --> 00:06:38,720
[SPEAKER_04]: So, here's the existing area that folks use and as you can see, it's really hard to maintain the grass in this area.

66
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:43,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Just the level of traffic that it gets in the dragging of furniture back and forth.

67
00:06:43,765 --> 00:06:48,050
[SPEAKER_04]: And to the extent that it's sort of kind of expose some of the tree roots that are there.

68
00:06:49,491 --> 00:06:57,076
[SPEAKER_04]: In addition to that, if someone wanted to be able to use this existing shade, there's not an accessible route from the pathway to where this is.

69
00:06:57,116 --> 00:07:00,918
[SPEAKER_04]: So you'd have to go off of the path and kind of traverse uneven ground.

70
00:07:03,099 --> 00:07:12,865
[SPEAKER_04]: So we are thinking about this low deck system because it would provide an accessible pathway to this new area underneath the trees where there's existing shade.

71
00:07:13,145 --> 00:07:14,426
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a nice spot.

72
00:07:15,046 --> 00:07:20,087
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually sit there a lot if I'm grabbing something from the square, food and stuff.

73
00:07:20,247 --> 00:07:36,153
[SPEAKER_04]: And we would have some mobile seating and some light bollards, which you can't see in this rendering, but perhaps placed at the far end of the deck just to shed a little bit more light in this area in the evening.

74
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:39,694
[SPEAKER_04]: And they would be in the same style as the existing light bollards.

75
00:07:44,511 --> 00:07:52,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so yeah, a couple of just examples of potential furniture, including the water fountain and and slash water filler.

76
00:07:55,537 --> 00:07:59,460
[SPEAKER_04]: And just a quick overview again of the funding for this project.

77
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:05,024
[SPEAKER_04]: So the park grant that we were awarded is just shy of $200,000 and our CPA ask is for about $144,000, which would go towards match.

78
00:08:05,044 --> 00:08:08,667
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is for both final design of this space as well as construction.

79
00:08:20,978 --> 00:08:30,690
[SPEAKER_04]: So I will stop the share so I can see people, and I'm happy to bring any of those images and things back up as we talk, but I'll open the floor now for questions.

80
00:08:33,353 --> 00:08:34,014
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a question.

81
00:08:34,034 --> 00:08:35,015
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Amanda.

82
00:08:36,777 --> 00:08:41,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there any reason why you're not putting one of these shade sails over the performance space?

83
00:08:43,638 --> 00:08:48,742
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's an opportunity to look into that.

84
00:08:48,802 --> 00:09:01,790
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd have to ask the designer, but I think we wanted to make use of some of the existing... There are some permanent furniture, like mounted tables and chairs that are in those other areas.

85
00:09:02,711 --> 00:09:12,398
[SPEAKER_04]: And we didn't want to also obstruct views of the stage, although I don't think that that would be too much of an issue if it were over the stage area.

86
00:09:13,062 --> 00:09:19,504
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was watching the Oompa Loompa guys playing at Oktoberfest in the sun, and it was hot.

87
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:22,185
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just felt bad for them, yeah.

88
00:09:23,386 --> 00:09:23,646
Yeah.

89
00:09:24,506 --> 00:09:25,866
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't say move one of them.

90
00:09:25,987 --> 00:09:29,088
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd say you need an additional sale, you know, because you're right.

91
00:09:29,388 --> 00:09:32,589
[SPEAKER_03]: You do need some coverage on that deck.

92
00:09:33,169 --> 00:09:33,909
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotcha.

93
00:09:34,229 --> 00:09:34,650
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it.

94
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:36,650
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the step up, too.

95
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:38,711
[SPEAKER_03]: That's nice, because you're right, that grass is all dead.

96
00:09:43,306 --> 00:09:44,207
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't clear.

97
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:44,988
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sorry.

98
00:09:45,008 --> 00:09:45,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead.

99
00:09:46,589 --> 00:09:47,289
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to add.

100
00:09:47,309 --> 00:09:50,992
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember if I mentioned that the deck is permeable.

101
00:09:51,172 --> 00:09:52,874
[SPEAKER_04]: So water can infiltrate down.

102
00:09:52,934 --> 00:09:56,657
[SPEAKER_04]: So it would protect the tree roots and allow water to get to the soil.

103
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,780
[SPEAKER_09]: Just a couple of comments 1st, I.

104
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:15,387
[SPEAKER_09]: Regarding the sale over the performance space, there's a park that I'm familiar with that I believe has a performance space and it has a removable sale.

105
00:10:15,487 --> 00:10:21,891
[SPEAKER_09]: So they can put it out and remove it or put it back in case it's in the way.

106
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:32,298
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know whether that could be something that would be hard to accomplish here or add a lot of costs to do something like that or be hard to maintain.

107
00:10:32,931 --> 00:10:57,262
[SPEAKER_09]: But the thing that I wanted to mention was, and I talked with you about this a little bit earlier as well, I have heard of other places where they have installed boardwalks in parks like this and then had a problem with it creating rat habitat because the rats like to find, they like to find

108
00:10:58,628 --> 00:11:03,653
[SPEAKER_09]: a place to burrow underneath the boardwalk where they're protected.

109
00:11:04,094 --> 00:11:12,222
[SPEAKER_09]: So I asked colleagues about how to prevent that situation and what they suggested is that there be

110
00:11:15,003 --> 00:11:22,447
[SPEAKER_09]: So I wrote it down like a steel gauge mesh installed in the soil under.

111
00:11:22,627 --> 00:11:36,874
[SPEAKER_09]: So like remove a little layer of soil gently so it's not to disturb the tree roots and then install steel gauge mesh under that and then put the soil back in the boardwalk and that prevents them from burrowing.

112
00:11:37,474 --> 00:11:43,097
[SPEAKER_09]: So I can provide more information about that later, but I would want to take that into consideration.

113
00:11:44,948 --> 00:11:53,590
[SPEAKER_09]: It seems to be a problem that occurs in a lot of places where boardwalks are installed for this very reason because of the heavy usage.

114
00:11:56,771 --> 00:12:00,131
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I would be very interested in.

115
00:12:01,191 --> 00:12:06,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, if you would share that information as it comes in, would definitely love to consider that with our designer.

116
00:12:10,393 --> 00:12:12,934
[SPEAKER_09]: Are there other questions from committee members?

117
00:12:18,285 --> 00:12:18,605
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

118
00:12:19,186 --> 00:12:21,548
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, thank you, Amanda, for that project.

119
00:12:23,549 --> 00:12:30,435
[SPEAKER_09]: And next, I think you're still up to talk to us about the car park renovation final tranche.

120
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:32,857
[SPEAKER_04]: That is correct.

121
00:12:32,957 --> 00:12:34,418
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to share my screen again.

122
00:12:34,438 --> 00:12:34,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Oops.

123
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:35,739
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

124
00:12:51,392 --> 00:12:58,615
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, so I bet most of you are familiar with Car Park, the renovation going on there.

125
00:13:00,036 --> 00:13:09,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Quick recap, the visioning process was funded by CPA funds, and so we have you guys to thank for this incredible vision we have for the space.

126
00:13:09,841 --> 00:13:12,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Phase one is substantially complete.

127
00:13:12,963 --> 00:13:31,713
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was pickleball courts, which were CPA funded and get a heck of a lot of use, baseball diamonds, loop pathway around the field, as well as some periphery areas and a formalized pathway from the park to Stowers Ave.

128
00:13:32,193 --> 00:13:35,395
[SPEAKER_04]: So all of that work is substantially complete.

129
00:13:36,076 --> 00:13:40,941
[SPEAKER_04]: And now we are moving on into phase two, which actually includes a lot of really exciting stuff.

130
00:13:42,042 --> 00:13:43,183
[SPEAKER_04]: It is currently out to bid.

131
00:13:44,386 --> 00:13:51,754
[SPEAKER_04]: And this includes new playground, dog park, two basketball courts, one of which would be covered by a shade structure.

132
00:13:52,595 --> 00:13:59,341
[SPEAKER_04]: And on that shade structure would be solar panels, which would power other features in the park, such as a small splash pad.

133
00:14:00,523 --> 00:14:06,649
[SPEAKER_04]: There'd be a mini skate park, a kind of teen area with some tall swings and an adult fitness area.

134
00:14:08,782 --> 00:14:26,130
[SPEAKER_04]: So, just to sort of orient ourselves a little bit, the scope of phase 2 includes these 2 areas of the park that the smaller circle is the dog park area and the larger circle, which will zoom in on is along Winslow Ave and has a lot of those other exciting features to.

135
00:14:28,664 --> 00:14:33,147
[SPEAKER_04]: So over on the left hand side here is our playground area.

136
00:14:33,207 --> 00:14:38,831
[SPEAKER_04]: There'll be both a two to five area and a five to 12 year old area, as well as the splash pad.

137
00:14:41,533 --> 00:14:43,374
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got two basketball courts.

138
00:14:44,354 --> 00:14:47,056
[SPEAKER_04]: One will be covered with the shade structure on the left there.

139
00:14:47,076 --> 00:14:51,219
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the one on the right will be also striped for street hockey.

140
00:14:54,328 --> 00:15:10,690
[SPEAKER_04]: We have some shaded seating areas, so there'll be a small shade pavilion on this in this area that has seating and charging pedestals, which will be powered in part by the solar panels.

141
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:18,265
[SPEAKER_04]: And over in this zone, we've got the mini skate park and adult fitness area.

142
00:15:18,285 --> 00:15:22,229
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just want to give you all a quick rendering of the mini skate park.

143
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:27,634
[SPEAKER_04]: We worked with Spawn Ranch, which is a very reputable skate park design firm.

144
00:15:29,275 --> 00:15:42,782
[SPEAKER_04]: and talked to a number of folks who are skaters in and around the area during our tabling sessions last fall and winter about what they kind of wanted to see in this beginner-friendly space.

145
00:15:46,673 --> 00:15:54,335
[SPEAKER_04]: A quick overview of the funding situation for this project, so there's 2.5M dollars of ARPA funding dedicated towards this.

146
00:15:54,915 --> 00:15:59,556
[SPEAKER_04]: A federal earmark through the Department of Energy for a million and a half.

147
00:16:00,776 --> 00:16:05,157
[SPEAKER_04]: And a land and water conservation grant that was awarded to us for 1M dollars.

148
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:12,239
[SPEAKER_04]: A little shy of 300,000 dollars of linkage funding has gone towards this project, particularly toward design.

149
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:15,120
[SPEAKER_04]: And so our ask is sort of the final mile.

150
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:21,743
[SPEAKER_04]: in helping us implement this for a little shy of $150,000 from CPA.

151
00:16:23,184 --> 00:16:26,606
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to stop sharing my screen, but I'm happy to go.

152
00:16:26,626 --> 00:16:27,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, don't.

153
00:16:27,247 --> 00:16:28,408
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you go back to the rendering?

154
00:16:28,428 --> 00:16:30,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, absolutely.

155
00:16:30,149 --> 00:16:30,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me see.

156
00:16:31,329 --> 00:16:32,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry about that.

157
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,091
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's OK.

158
00:16:35,592 --> 00:16:37,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Share back here.

159
00:16:39,815 --> 00:16:40,235
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

160
00:16:41,036 --> 00:16:42,937
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, any particular picture, Joan?

161
00:16:43,472 --> 00:16:43,852
[SPEAKER_03]: That one.

162
00:16:44,572 --> 00:16:55,335
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I want to know, and I can't really tell from this, is in the current situation, in the current setup, there is that tot lot.

163
00:16:55,975 --> 00:16:59,516
[SPEAKER_03]: And it says dogs not allowed in the tot lot.

164
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:03,416
[SPEAKER_03]: But it looks like there's a pathway that goes through.

165
00:17:03,936 --> 00:17:07,517
[SPEAKER_03]: Would that be accessible by everyone?

166
00:17:08,197 --> 00:17:10,198
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not part of the tot lot, right?

167
00:17:11,298 --> 00:17:13,239
[SPEAKER_04]: So you know what I realized?

168
00:17:13,419 --> 00:17:19,803
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have this concept drawing is a little outdated from our final design and maybe I can pull up something.

169
00:17:20,223 --> 00:17:25,406
[SPEAKER_04]: I have some very detailed construction documents which I'd be happy to share with the committee.

170
00:17:25,686 --> 00:17:27,007
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just a bit messy to look at.

171
00:17:27,407 --> 00:17:38,474
[SPEAKER_04]: But the way that this is actually finalized is the two to five area, our top lot area is over here as opposed to the five to 12 and it's entirely fenced off.

172
00:17:39,235 --> 00:17:44,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so it will not be able to be accessed by people unless you're going in through the gated area.

173
00:17:44,846 --> 00:17:45,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

174
00:17:47,447 --> 00:17:50,108
[SPEAKER_04]: The five to 12 area is up here.

175
00:17:51,129 --> 00:18:03,514
[SPEAKER_04]: In that we were told by kids in particular that they kind of wanted like a free flowing feel between the play area and the park in the fields, I should say.

176
00:18:04,315 --> 00:18:10,958
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's partially fenced off in areas I think along here, but otherwise like relatively open.

177
00:18:14,728 --> 00:18:18,889
[SPEAKER_03]: The walkway around, which is a really good place to walk the dog.

178
00:18:19,269 --> 00:18:25,230
[SPEAKER_03]: But then to get back out to Winslow, this path that we currently take is going to be covered by the basketball court.

179
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:29,511
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm looking for a path to get from the walkway back out to Winslow.

180
00:18:30,111 --> 00:18:30,912
[SPEAKER_04]: It is here.

181
00:18:30,932 --> 00:18:33,812
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've got this through way path.

182
00:18:33,992 --> 00:18:39,394
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like the main entrance to the park and you would walk through here and it connects to the loop pathway.

183
00:18:40,154 --> 00:18:48,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and also I think there's a new, there's a new sleigh of e-bikes that are there that are not in use, right?

184
00:18:48,738 --> 00:18:51,859
[SPEAKER_03]: So that'll be, I don't know exactly where those are, but yes.

185
00:18:52,199 --> 00:18:53,460
[SPEAKER_04]: They are over here.

186
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:58,642
[SPEAKER_04]: I helped site them with Todd Blake, who's our transportation director.

187
00:18:59,343 --> 00:19:06,846
[SPEAKER_04]: They should be about over here and they won't interrupt any of the pathways and like connections planned for this stretch.

188
00:19:07,615 --> 00:19:07,855
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

189
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:10,477
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know you said you're out to bid.

190
00:19:10,717 --> 00:19:16,780
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the estimated timeline of this construction finish, I should say?

191
00:19:17,941 --> 00:19:21,222
[SPEAKER_04]: That is a million-dollar question.

192
00:19:22,883 --> 00:19:26,245
[SPEAKER_04]: This is just a rough estimate.

193
00:19:26,285 --> 00:19:27,566
[SPEAKER_04]: So take it with a grain of salt.

194
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:34,009
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to learn more when we get more back or get bids back from the contractors.

195
00:19:36,151 --> 00:19:36,831
[SPEAKER_04]: and all of that.

196
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:43,417
[SPEAKER_04]: But my guess is that we are going to start building or breaking ground early spring of next year.

197
00:19:44,237 --> 00:19:54,846
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would estimate that this type of project would take between a year to a year and a half beyond that.

198
00:19:55,587 --> 00:20:00,130
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think we could see, let's see, so spring of 2025 we start, so then maybe end of 2026

199
00:20:04,731 --> 00:20:15,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, yes, and I should say that the fields and the loop pathway, we have made clear in our bid documents.

200
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:22,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Those need to remain open to the fullest extent possible through that entire time.

201
00:20:22,407 --> 00:20:23,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Since we'll be blocking off, you know.

202
00:20:23,988 --> 00:20:24,769
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of the, a lot of the, you know.

203
00:20:24,989 --> 00:20:31,414
[SPEAKER_04]: All of this area during construction, there might be a period where see if I can go back to the larger.

204
00:20:32,455 --> 00:20:41,642
[SPEAKER_04]: As I mentioned, we'll also be doing the dog park in phase 2 and so there might be a period where we need to create a temporary pathway around this.

205
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:52,830
[SPEAKER_04]: But we will that is the intent basically to ensure that there is a pathway around that all of these facilities remain open during construction.

206
00:20:54,071 --> 00:20:54,331
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

207
00:20:55,311 --> 00:20:55,572
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

208
00:20:56,312 --> 00:20:56,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.

209
00:20:57,352 --> 00:20:57,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.

210
00:21:01,013 --> 00:21:02,774
[SPEAKER_09]: Other questions from committee members?

211
00:21:06,455 --> 00:21:07,116
[SPEAKER_09]: Looks beautiful.

212
00:21:08,576 --> 00:21:08,936
[SPEAKER_08]: What's that?

213
00:21:09,016 --> 00:21:09,596
[SPEAKER_08]: Just a comment.

214
00:21:09,616 --> 00:21:10,117
[SPEAKER_08]: Looks beautiful.

215
00:21:11,973 --> 00:21:13,814
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, one other question.

216
00:21:14,435 --> 00:21:15,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there water fountains all around?

217
00:21:15,956 --> 00:21:17,637
[SPEAKER_03]: I know there's one near the pickleball courts.

218
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:19,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, there's one.

219
00:21:19,418 --> 00:21:21,700
[SPEAKER_03]: There should be something near the dog park.

220
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:22,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

221
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Something we could, you know.

222
00:21:25,442 --> 00:21:26,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

223
00:21:26,403 --> 00:21:29,825
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's going to be, I think it's three more fountains.

224
00:21:30,085 --> 00:21:33,748
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have one by the pickleball courts over here, if you can see my cursor.

225
00:21:34,528 --> 00:21:38,371
[SPEAKER_04]: One will be in the dog park, a little dog bowl filling station.

226
00:21:40,072 --> 00:21:40,592
[SPEAKER_04]: There will be...

227
00:21:42,792 --> 00:21:49,907
[SPEAKER_04]: one by the shade structure with seating underneath, and one by the basketball courts.

228
00:21:50,627 --> 00:21:50,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, good.

229
00:21:51,388 --> 00:21:58,733
[SPEAKER_03]: And by the way, the city fixed the one that's by the pickleball courts because it had no water pressure.

230
00:21:58,753 --> 00:22:01,655
[SPEAKER_03]: But I was there this weekend, and it's flowing very nicely.

231
00:22:01,975 --> 00:22:03,476
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

232
00:22:03,516 --> 00:22:04,497
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

233
00:22:04,857 --> 00:22:15,245
[SPEAKER_04]: We had an issue where they had to turn the irrigation system off, and they accidentally shut off an important valve that was deleting the pressure to the water factor.

234
00:22:16,205 --> 00:22:21,669
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you to you and to others who flagged that for us, because that would have been a shame.

235
00:22:23,591 --> 00:22:24,311
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.

236
00:22:25,712 --> 00:22:26,273
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Amanda.

237
00:22:28,615 --> 00:22:37,541
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm curious how to learn more about the debris removal that you did up in the upper end of the park.

238
00:22:37,561 --> 00:22:38,862
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you speak more to that?

239
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:39,603
[SPEAKER_09]: And is it done?

240
00:22:41,097 --> 00:22:48,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, so we focused the majority of the debris removal kind of around here.

241
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:55,999
[SPEAKER_04]: And it involved, yeah, it was actually, oh, I wish I could send you guys some pictures.

242
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:08,434
[SPEAKER_04]: It would probably take me too long to find them because they're buried, but there's some really fascinating piles of concrete slabs and marble slabs.

243
00:23:09,035 --> 00:23:10,817
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, granite, not marble.

244
00:23:11,778 --> 00:23:14,960
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, old sort of construction debris from the city.

245
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,801
[SPEAKER_04]: It was actually very sizable.

246
00:23:17,862 --> 00:23:20,664
[SPEAKER_04]: They were pulled very early in the project.

247
00:23:21,885 --> 00:23:26,248
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want to say the majority of that work was done in the fall of 2023.

248
00:23:29,755 --> 00:23:34,116
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm tempted to just look and see if I have a photo.

249
00:23:34,857 --> 00:23:36,257
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm curious.

250
00:23:36,357 --> 00:23:42,739
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there was fairly a good amount of trash in there, too, besides the construction debris.

251
00:23:42,779 --> 00:23:43,299
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

252
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:46,960
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember seeing a bike in there during one of the cleanups.

253
00:23:47,881 --> 00:23:49,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Several gas grills.

254
00:23:49,121 --> 00:23:50,221
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

255
00:23:50,241 --> 00:23:50,381
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

256
00:23:50,421 --> 00:23:53,442
[SPEAKER_07]: It was definitely a very interesting experience.

257
00:24:00,422 --> 00:24:05,783
[SPEAKER_04]: If others have questions, I will look while if anyone else wants to ask a question too.

258
00:24:05,923 --> 00:24:07,023
[SPEAKER_03]: I have one other question.

259
00:24:07,123 --> 00:24:12,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Wasn't there in an early design a walkway that was going to go through that foresty area?

260
00:24:13,025 --> 00:24:14,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever happened to that?

261
00:24:14,945 --> 00:24:15,445
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.

262
00:24:16,245 --> 00:24:19,026
[SPEAKER_04]: The Stowers Ave connection, is that what you're referring to?

263
00:24:19,426 --> 00:24:21,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I know that one.

264
00:24:21,367 --> 00:24:27,708
[SPEAKER_03]: I wondered if there was one that was going to go through that whole thing, even over to the other side down to Winslow.

265
00:24:28,517 --> 00:24:30,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't there something?

266
00:24:31,298 --> 00:24:37,799
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a pump truck that's kind of planned for a later stage, obviously different from a walking path.

267
00:24:37,879 --> 00:24:39,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's what it was.

268
00:24:39,239 --> 00:24:40,480
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what it was.

269
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:40,680
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

270
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:40,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

271
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,760
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, that is not included in this scope.

272
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:48,301
[SPEAKER_04]: But we talked to our designer a little bit about how to approach that.

273
00:24:48,541 --> 00:24:55,903
[SPEAKER_04]: And they'd recommended kind of going with a firm that sort of specializes in that, since it's like a very limited scope.

274
00:24:57,384 --> 00:25:03,511
[SPEAKER_04]: And there is a NEMBA grant that we could apply for in the future to do that work.

275
00:25:04,452 --> 00:25:04,692
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

276
00:25:06,875 --> 00:25:12,782
[SPEAKER_09]: If this is already out to bid, how is the CPA funds being plugged into the budget?

277
00:25:14,417 --> 00:25:21,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, so I had wanted to recommend that if this were to be funded with CPA funds.

278
00:25:21,523 --> 00:25:30,811
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is the budget that I laid out is for sort of construction administration design as well as construction.

279
00:25:31,651 --> 00:25:40,199
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think a tidy way to do this, although we don't have to, would be to direct those funds towards construction administration.

280
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:47,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is a very valuable service, especially for a project of this size and scale.

281
00:25:47,642 --> 00:26:02,066
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically would go towards our landscape architect and all of their team of sub consultants who would be meeting with us regularly and with the contractor to kind of keep things on track, address issues as they come up through the entirety of the project.

282
00:26:02,566 --> 00:26:05,967
[SPEAKER_04]: And that contracting could happen later than the

283
00:26:07,748 --> 00:26:22,231
[SPEAKER_04]: bid the construction contracting which would be kind of working on that contract for a while and then like early next year could contract with the design firm for their construction admin services.

284
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:37,713
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you're still looking for that photo, I'll I'll fill in some dead air here.

285
00:26:38,253 --> 00:26:44,977
[SPEAKER_07]: I really love that the work that you've been doing with pulling out some of those salvageable debris.

286
00:26:45,575 --> 00:26:49,677
[SPEAKER_07]: boulders and then repurposing them around the city, like at McGlynn where we were today.

287
00:26:50,758 --> 00:26:52,359
[SPEAKER_07]: You've brought some of those boulders over there.

288
00:26:52,379 --> 00:26:56,541
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you plan on bringing some over to Logan Park for that playground area.

289
00:26:56,621 --> 00:27:02,745
[SPEAKER_07]: So I love how resourceful we're being while also cleaning up a site that very much needs cleanup.

290
00:27:02,825 --> 00:27:04,566
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll just go on the record.

291
00:27:04,626 --> 00:27:05,366
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll put it in the minutes.

292
00:27:05,386 --> 00:27:06,087
[SPEAKER_07]: I love it.

293
00:27:09,234 --> 00:27:10,135
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Teresa.

294
00:27:10,836 --> 00:27:12,258
[SPEAKER_03]: I second that on the boulders.

295
00:27:12,318 --> 00:27:16,983
[SPEAKER_03]: They're wonderful, especially down those that the stores have that was good down there.

296
00:27:17,624 --> 00:27:17,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

297
00:27:18,665 --> 00:27:23,310
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I don't have anything substantive, but I think it looks awesome.

298
00:27:25,112 --> 00:27:26,314
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, great perk.

299
00:27:28,485 --> 00:27:29,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you guys.

300
00:27:29,266 --> 00:27:30,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I sorry.

301
00:27:30,887 --> 00:27:38,192
[SPEAKER_04]: There's like 30 pages worth of photos for viewing, but if you want to share that with me, I can get it to the committee.

302
00:27:38,212 --> 00:27:38,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

303
00:27:38,692 --> 00:27:40,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe that would be a better use of your time.

304
00:27:40,974 --> 00:27:43,956
[SPEAKER_04]: I will certainly send over what I find to you all.

305
00:27:44,977 --> 00:27:45,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

306
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:50,720
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you, Amanda.

307
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,582
[SPEAKER_09]: If we have nothing else, are you?

308
00:27:53,602 --> 00:27:56,263
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, no, you're not on the next.

309
00:27:56,523 --> 00:27:56,883
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

310
00:27:56,923 --> 00:27:59,124
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's that's all that you have for us this evening.

311
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:00,025
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you very much.

312
00:28:02,266 --> 00:28:02,666
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

313
00:28:05,427 --> 00:28:13,331
[SPEAKER_09]: And I will move on to the next presentation that we have, which is for the Unitarian Universalist Church exterior restoration.

314
00:28:13,351 --> 00:28:16,133
[SPEAKER_09]: Liz Ammons and Joan King.

315
00:28:17,495 --> 00:28:21,577
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're graced with the physical presence of our applicants.

316
00:28:21,657 --> 00:28:23,418
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's up to you.

317
00:28:23,438 --> 00:28:30,422
[SPEAKER_07]: We were thinking if you wanted to stand at the podium and then present to us, just tell us a bit about your project wherever you're comfortable.

318
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:35,325
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think with the technology we have in the room, we would need you to be closer to the team.

319
00:28:35,385 --> 00:28:36,045
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

320
00:28:36,065 --> 00:28:37,646
[SPEAKER_07]: So whatever you're comfortable with.

321
00:28:39,606 --> 00:28:41,527
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually this little doozy hickey right there.

322
00:28:41,727 --> 00:28:44,029
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got a 360 camera so you can.

323
00:28:46,611 --> 00:28:53,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Several people have been good enough to wrote letters for us to offer to come.

324
00:28:54,035 --> 00:28:58,058
[SPEAKER_02]: John Anderson from the Medford Historical Society and Museum.

325
00:28:58,118 --> 00:28:59,319
[SPEAKER_02]: He's the president there.

326
00:29:00,659 --> 00:29:04,462
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to be sure that they have time to make some comments.

327
00:29:08,643 --> 00:29:11,785
[SPEAKER_02]: chair of the board of trustees at the Unitarian Universalist Church.

328
00:29:12,365 --> 00:29:14,686
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to give her the chance to say a couple of things.

329
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:16,267
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Liz Ammons.

330
00:29:17,507 --> 00:29:19,868
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Joan Keane.

331
00:29:19,948 --> 00:29:24,810
[SPEAKER_02]: The two of us wrote the, am I on camera?

332
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:26,431
[SPEAKER_07]: You can look up there if it's quite all right.

333
00:29:26,451 --> 00:29:26,971
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't worry about it.

334
00:29:27,231 --> 00:29:28,272
[SPEAKER_07]: But you are on camera.

335
00:29:28,332 --> 00:29:28,952
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, great.

336
00:29:29,072 --> 00:29:32,874
[SPEAKER_07]: And at home, Joan, Ari, can you hear us well?

337
00:29:32,914 --> 00:29:33,474
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, perfect.

338
00:29:33,554 --> 00:29:34,314
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, great.

339
00:29:34,334 --> 00:29:34,854
[SPEAKER_07]: So,

340
00:29:37,268 --> 00:29:43,193
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me start off by just talking a little bit about what we are applying for.

341
00:29:43,533 --> 00:29:58,186
[SPEAKER_02]: We're applying for the CPA funding to do restoration on the two major exterior walls of the Unitarian Universalist Church, which is located on High Street, a block from the library.

342
00:29:58,226 --> 00:30:03,850
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a major historic landmark in the city, right on High Street in the center of the square.

343
00:30:04,471 --> 00:30:05,732
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're applying for

344
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:21,412
[SPEAKER_02]: money to re-shingle two walls, the western wall and the north wall, and then some certain places on window frames and some wood that needs attention as well.

345
00:30:21,972 --> 00:30:28,798
[SPEAKER_02]: In the grant, it's asked what is the benefit of this building to the community and to the city.

346
00:30:29,818 --> 00:30:34,502
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, I think we just want to highlight three things that we think are really important.

347
00:30:36,253 --> 00:30:49,263
[SPEAKER_02]: first, and they aren't ranked, but one is it's a tremendous benefit to the city as a historic landmark of architectural merit.

348
00:30:50,083 --> 00:31:03,153
[SPEAKER_02]: The building is an 1894 Gothic Revival structure in beautiful shape in a prominent location in the city, designed by an MIT-trained architect, a renowned

349
00:31:03,775 --> 00:31:19,242
[SPEAKER_02]: And we could go on and on about the architectural importance of this building in the visual landscape of Medford and our effort in the city of all of us to preserve historical buildings.

350
00:31:19,843 --> 00:31:26,006
[SPEAKER_02]: The second thing is its historical importance as for its cultural history.

351
00:31:26,846 --> 00:31:28,247
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not just a building.

352
00:31:28,667 --> 00:31:30,748
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also a building that stands for

353
00:31:31,673 --> 00:31:36,297
[SPEAKER_02]: long history in Medford and important history.

354
00:31:37,438 --> 00:31:47,767
[SPEAKER_02]: The Unitarian Church traces its origins directly back to the first church in Medford, the Puritan Church in the 17th century.

355
00:31:48,808 --> 00:31:52,011
[SPEAKER_02]: Its current incarnation is really different.

356
00:31:52,498 --> 00:31:53,899
[SPEAKER_02]: from the Puritan church.

357
00:31:54,320 --> 00:32:02,406
[SPEAKER_02]: They would be appalled at what we believe today, as we in ways are appalled by what they believed then.

358
00:32:02,546 --> 00:32:05,509
[SPEAKER_02]: But we are the direct descendants.

359
00:32:06,169 --> 00:32:14,817
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the fifth building that this church has had in Medford, and the third one in this location.

360
00:32:15,377 --> 00:32:20,061
[SPEAKER_02]: So this cultural history includes that narrative

361
00:32:21,859 --> 00:32:36,307
[SPEAKER_02]: of a religious faith institution in the city and the evolutions that has gone through and includes a lot of important figures in Medford.

362
00:32:36,507 --> 00:32:46,052
[SPEAKER_02]: David Osgood was one of the important ministers in the Osgood House through CPA Grant is now a beautiful historic landmark in the city.

363
00:32:48,613 --> 00:33:08,977
[SPEAKER_02]: A number of the members who attended the church, Lydia Mariah Child, an advocate for Indian reform, for women's rights, a fierce abolitionist, George Luther Stearns, also an important abolitionist who, I'm going to get a drink of water.

364
00:33:12,637 --> 00:33:17,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Abolitionists who, among other things, was one of the secret six who

365
00:33:18,207 --> 00:33:28,354
[SPEAKER_02]: backed John Brown, and Stearns was the recruiter of the famous Massachusetts 54th Regiment, the first black regiment in the United States Army.

366
00:33:29,975 --> 00:33:47,407
[SPEAKER_02]: Danny Farmer was a member of the church, different kind of fame, and we could name other people down to Eugene Adams in the 1960s, who marched with Dr. King and Selma, and wore overalls when he preached until the

367
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:53,353
[SPEAKER_02]: the workers in the great fields of California were able to get unionized.

368
00:33:53,713 --> 00:34:08,324
[SPEAKER_02]: So the church has an important social history and cultural history and actually social justice history, which it carries on today in its advocacy for people in the city and beyond the city who often

369
00:34:10,057 --> 00:34:12,218
[SPEAKER_02]: are dealing with difficult, difficult issues.

370
00:34:12,858 --> 00:34:21,361
[SPEAKER_02]: The third thing that I'll mention, and then I'll stop, is the importance of this church, this building, as a community resource right now.

371
00:34:21,801 --> 00:34:37,406
[SPEAKER_02]: It is used, it's been used for over 27 years by the Community Covered Food Pantry, which is open every single week on Thursday nights, and has been for all those years, serving people in need who are dealing with hunger.

372
00:34:38,596 --> 00:34:42,398
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has several 12-step groups in the church.

373
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:50,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Alcoholics Anonymous, Al-Anon, a community orchestra meets in the building.

374
00:34:51,822 --> 00:34:53,443
[SPEAKER_02]: Contra dancers are in the building.

375
00:34:53,463 --> 00:34:54,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Tai Chi is in the building.

376
00:34:55,164 --> 00:34:58,886
[SPEAKER_02]: So it really is used by, it's not just a church.

377
00:34:59,882 --> 00:35:07,046
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actively used by many groups in the community for ongoing kinds of things like that, and also for one-off things.

378
00:35:07,726 --> 00:35:17,851
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, CPA had a lovely celebration in our social hall in the building, which we were honored to host.

379
00:35:18,551 --> 00:35:28,936
[SPEAKER_02]: So for these reasons, we think that it's a worthy applicant for CPA grants for its architectural importance, for its cultural

380
00:35:29,409 --> 00:35:43,316
[SPEAKER_02]: history, which is really important, including its present activity in the city and for its service to the community as a building that's open for people to use.

381
00:35:44,197 --> 00:35:45,518
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll stop with that.

382
00:35:46,018 --> 00:35:48,739
[SPEAKER_02]: We are applying for 90,000 dollars.

383
00:35:56,101 --> 00:35:58,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Cedar shingle is very expensive.

384
00:35:58,801 --> 00:36:01,642
[SPEAKER_02]: It is very expensive and it's gone up year by year.

385
00:36:02,042 --> 00:36:08,943
[SPEAKER_02]: We, the church, has been a wonderful steward of this property and maintained it.

386
00:36:09,863 --> 00:36:12,044
[SPEAKER_02]: It's slate roof.

387
00:36:12,084 --> 00:36:16,205
[SPEAKER_02]: Had the granite tower taken down and repointed.

388
00:36:16,225 --> 00:36:22,466
[SPEAKER_02]: The window was taken, the huge window facing High Street was taken out and completely redone.

389
00:36:23,546 --> 00:36:24,106
[SPEAKER_02]: We put in

390
00:36:24,785 --> 00:36:29,126
[SPEAKER_02]: the proper kind of vented plexiglass to protect stained glass windows.

391
00:36:29,426 --> 00:36:31,547
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not like the church has done nothing.

392
00:36:31,807 --> 00:36:32,547
[SPEAKER_02]: We've done a lot.

393
00:36:32,807 --> 00:36:35,788
[SPEAKER_02]: We're an active church and we're not a rich church.

394
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:49,351
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need these funds to complete this last step of restoration to bring the building into really sound shape so it will not deteriorate.

395
00:36:49,992 --> 00:36:51,532
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what I would

396
00:36:53,518 --> 00:36:56,560
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm happy to pull up photos, by the way, onto the screen.

397
00:36:56,580 --> 00:37:01,142
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if that would be helpful for the committee members and the folks in the room.

398
00:37:01,502 --> 00:37:01,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

399
00:37:02,363 --> 00:37:03,403
[SPEAKER_10]: Joan, you had a question.

400
00:37:04,083 --> 00:37:07,505
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so I'm looking at pictures of it right now on Google Maps.

401
00:37:07,805 --> 00:37:11,007
[SPEAKER_03]: You said you were going to redo two sides.

402
00:37:11,087 --> 00:37:19,231
[SPEAKER_03]: So is it the front triangle part where the big stained glass window is and then down on Powder House Road?

403
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:24,572
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, that is fairly recently done.

404
00:37:24,833 --> 00:37:27,855
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a few shambles that need to be replaced, but that's in good shape.

405
00:37:28,275 --> 00:37:32,538
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the western wall and the north wall.

406
00:37:32,839 --> 00:37:37,242
[SPEAKER_02]: The wall that actually faces our parking lot is very visible from Powder House.

407
00:37:37,702 --> 00:37:44,927
[SPEAKER_02]: And the western wall, which is less visible from the street, but is crucial to the integrity of the building.

408
00:37:46,148 --> 00:37:46,368
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

409
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:56,874
[SPEAKER_03]: So, the West and the North side parking lots.

410
00:37:57,015 --> 00:37:58,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

411
00:38:02,919 --> 00:38:11,186
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to comment that I really appreciate the effort that you put into the, the history and the storytelling of the church.

412
00:38:11,826 --> 00:38:20,433
[SPEAKER_09]: Being able to tell the story about the significance of all the locations that we find, I think, is an important goal that we have.

413
00:38:21,427 --> 00:38:24,910
[SPEAKER_09]: And so that's very helpful that you've filled in some of that.

414
00:38:40,144 --> 00:38:41,745
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm scrolling too fast or slow.

415
00:38:53,296 --> 00:38:55,958
[SPEAKER_09]: Other comments, questions from committee members?

416
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:02,122
[SPEAKER_10]: Comments from the public?

417
00:39:10,588 --> 00:39:11,128
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening.

418
00:39:11,988 --> 00:39:13,029
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm John Anderson.

419
00:39:13,349 --> 00:39:20,294
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, the Historical Society recognizes the importance of this building

420
00:39:21,055 --> 00:39:26,876
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't feel I can add anything to what Liz has already so aptly described about the history.

421
00:39:27,736 --> 00:39:33,758
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm actually speaking more as the owner of an 1880 shingle house.

422
00:39:35,038 --> 00:39:37,218
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've lived there for 40 years.

423
00:39:37,238 --> 00:39:40,739
[SPEAKER_06]: I can tell you that these issues need to be addressed.

424
00:39:41,659 --> 00:39:42,959
[SPEAKER_06]: They cannot be ignored.

425
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:50,721
[SPEAKER_06]: When you see that level of problems, you know it's only a matter of time before it goes beyond into the sheathing

426
00:39:51,918 --> 00:39:55,020
[SPEAKER_06]: and you get just, the problems just escalate.

427
00:39:55,620 --> 00:40:02,523
[SPEAKER_06]: We had to have a major portion of our house reshingled in the same manner a number of years ago.

428
00:40:03,804 --> 00:40:08,206
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just want to stress the importance of this getting done in a timely manner.

429
00:40:08,667 --> 00:40:09,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

430
00:40:09,767 --> 00:40:10,347
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

431
00:40:10,948 --> 00:40:15,190
[SPEAKER_06]: John, if we could have your address for the record, I'm so sorry.

432
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:17,071
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, 102 Brooks Street in Medford.

433
00:40:17,091 --> 00:40:17,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

434
00:40:23,208 --> 00:40:29,470
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm Lori August, I'm chair of the Board of Trustees at Unitarian University's Church of Medford.

435
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:39,352
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'll just emphasize, we often talk about us being a historical church and church as a community, as a community asset.

436
00:40:39,912 --> 00:40:51,775
[SPEAKER_13]: And just to emphasize that for 300 years, we've been a very vital, central part of the city of Medford for those many years.

437
00:40:53,675 --> 00:41:03,058
[SPEAKER_13]: In order to continue that legacy, we need a secure building by which to meet, by which to share our resources with the community.

438
00:41:03,078 --> 00:41:12,862
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's just important that we take care of the building for its historical reasons, but just so that we can continue doing what we do in the community.

439
00:41:13,202 --> 00:41:13,582
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

440
00:41:19,893 --> 00:41:26,159
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there anything else that we need to ask or hear about this project?

441
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:33,365
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, thank you very much for coming out this evening to talk with us, all of you.

442
00:41:33,385 --> 00:41:38,109
[SPEAKER_10]: Appreciate it for your application.

443
00:41:38,129 --> 00:41:42,612
[SPEAKER_07]: I promise you'd be out of here before 830.

444
00:41:48,965 --> 00:41:56,169
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, then we will move on to the next project on the list, which is city hall restroom, 88 upgrades.

445
00:41:58,410 --> 00:41:58,950
[SPEAKER_07]: Nick, you're up.

446
00:42:00,191 --> 00:42:05,074
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually all Paul is all is online.

447
00:42:05,134 --> 00:42:08,996
[SPEAKER_07]: Paul, if you can hear us, we are prepared to hear the application.

448
00:42:09,056 --> 00:42:09,776
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much.

449
00:42:09,796 --> 00:42:09,976
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Paul.

450
00:42:17,781 --> 00:42:18,502
[SPEAKER_07]: There he is, okay.

451
00:42:19,002 --> 00:42:20,523
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, there's something.

452
00:42:21,264 --> 00:42:26,008
[SPEAKER_07]: Something is... Paul, you're muted.

453
00:42:29,211 --> 00:42:31,653
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sorry, my laptop's giving me issues.

454
00:42:32,734 --> 00:42:34,595
[SPEAKER_07]: No worries, if you wanna stay off camera.

455
00:42:34,655 --> 00:42:35,356
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see.

456
00:42:35,896 --> 00:42:38,578
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, if you wanna stay off camera, you can just speak.

457
00:42:38,999 --> 00:42:45,024
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, everything is giving me issues tonight on this laptop.

458
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:46,205
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it needs to go away.

459
00:42:50,066 --> 00:42:50,466
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

460
00:42:54,448 --> 00:42:58,590
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are at a point at City Hall.

461
00:43:00,671 --> 00:43:04,933
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of City Hall doesn't meet ADA compliance anywhere.

462
00:43:06,034 --> 00:43:16,039
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the big issues is our bathrooms, especially with not only staff that work in City Hall, but the public that come into City Hall.

463
00:43:17,152 --> 00:43:45,286
[SPEAKER_00]: What we need to do is start renovating our bathrooms, not only bringing them back to how they looked when City Hall was built, but also keep in mind that we need to become ADA compliant for all the residents in Medford that use City Hall, whether it's to see city departments or for school board meetings.

464
00:43:46,686 --> 00:43:50,029
[SPEAKER_00]: or city council meetings, or any events in City Hall.

465
00:43:51,250 --> 00:44:00,317
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the years, I think they have tried to do renovations in bathrooms, and they were not done successfully.

466
00:44:02,699 --> 00:44:12,766
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a vendor in when we were having some issues, and just case in point, none of the toilet paper holders were even installed ADA compliant.

467
00:44:13,667 --> 00:44:29,503
[SPEAKER_00]: In the bathrooms and it is kind of sad when you see that neglect that has been allowed to go on over the years and working with Francis and her office and Nick.

468
00:44:30,687 --> 00:44:45,676
[SPEAKER_00]: We're developing a plan so we can start slowly but surely bringing our bathrooms up to current ADA code and bring them back to hopefully the beauty they were when they were installed.

469
00:44:46,156 --> 00:44:51,079
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, most of the bathrooms still have the original marble and the original floors.

470
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:57,122
[SPEAKER_00]: But over the years, they haven't been taken care of.

471
00:44:57,242 --> 00:45:07,626
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to preserve those, bring them back, and put new fixtures in, and everything with a mind towards

472
00:45:08,426 --> 00:45:11,347
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing everything back to ADA compliance.

473
00:45:11,427 --> 00:45:27,993
[SPEAKER_00]: So what this money would be is basically seed money for us to start this project because our first thing we need to do is bring in an architect so we can develop that plan with the architect.

474
00:45:29,793 --> 00:45:41,580
[SPEAKER_00]: and go forward from there and then over the years, because this is definitely not going to be a one-year project over the years.

475
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:53,787
[SPEAKER_00]: I envision probably three years that hopefully we can bring every bathroom in City Hall back to the way it should be and meet current ADA codes.

476
00:45:58,523 --> 00:45:58,983
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

477
00:45:59,003 --> 00:46:02,145
[SPEAKER_10]: Are there questions from committee members?

478
00:46:05,207 --> 00:46:08,729
[SPEAKER_12]: I was just wondering, how many bathrooms are there?

479
00:46:08,909 --> 00:46:09,409
[SPEAKER_12]: Are there six?

480
00:46:09,989 --> 00:46:10,150
Eight.

481
00:46:10,690 --> 00:46:12,051
[SPEAKER_00]: There are eight bathrooms.

482
00:46:12,091 --> 00:46:19,095
[SPEAKER_00]: There are four on the first floor, two on the second floor, and two on the third floor.

483
00:46:20,224 --> 00:46:24,426
[SPEAKER_00]: The first floor, two of the bathrooms are staff only bathrooms.

484
00:46:25,087 --> 00:46:33,071
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are technically the bathrooms that are large enough to be fully ADA compliant.

485
00:46:33,651 --> 00:46:42,857
[SPEAKER_00]: So my feeling is that when we start doing this project, we will probably switch the focus of the staff bathroom

486
00:46:43,917 --> 00:47:00,929
[SPEAKER_00]: and the public bathroom over, so when we make the bathrooms fully compliant, the ones that are currently staff only, which are the larger and can be fully ADA compliant, would be now become the public bathrooms.

487
00:47:04,894 --> 00:47:19,524
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I say fully ADA compliant is the other two bathrooms on the first floor are not large enough for anyone in a wheelchair to access the bathroom and to be able to use the bathroom.

488
00:47:20,544 --> 00:47:22,026
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortably and properly.

489
00:47:22,726 --> 00:47:46,205
[SPEAKER_00]: By flipping them, we would gain the space so that we can have those bathrooms designed for any visitor to City Hall, whether it's staff, community member, or even outside the community that we know and are confident that they can use a bathroom if they require it.

490
00:47:50,651 --> 00:47:53,152
[SPEAKER_12]: Obviously, I'm not staffed.

491
00:47:53,732 --> 00:48:08,097
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking at the stairway on the first floor, they're basically to the right and the left of that stairway about the middle of the stairway on either side of the stairway.

492
00:48:08,857 --> 00:48:11,178
[SPEAKER_00]: They are hidden.

493
00:48:11,418 --> 00:48:15,699
[SPEAKER_00]: If we do switch them, we will have to make sure we have proper signage up also.

494
00:48:18,394 --> 00:48:19,295
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, thank you.

495
00:48:19,515 --> 00:48:19,815
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

496
00:48:19,875 --> 00:48:22,358
[SPEAKER_09]: I see Joe's hand first, so then I'll come to you.

497
00:48:23,319 --> 00:48:26,942
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm looking at the and maybe Tracy, you can help me.

498
00:48:26,982 --> 00:48:31,786
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking at the the drop box and the only thing I see is the application.

499
00:48:31,886 --> 00:48:32,827
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see a quote.

500
00:48:33,247 --> 00:48:34,689
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see anything else.

501
00:48:36,277 --> 00:48:47,044
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason being is that if I start getting quotes from people, I'm held to 30 days, and then I have to go out and start re-quoting again.

502
00:48:48,205 --> 00:48:54,229
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus, this is also, if it's over a certain amount of money, I have to go out and get three quotes.

503
00:48:54,309 --> 00:48:55,870
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't just get one quote.

504
00:48:56,910 --> 00:49:03,816
[SPEAKER_00]: Because anything over $10,000 I do as a city project, I have to have three quotes for construction.

505
00:49:03,836 --> 00:49:04,877
[SPEAKER_00]: This is $215,000.

506
00:49:05,017 --> 00:49:05,698
[SPEAKER_00]: What am I missing?

507
00:49:05,718 --> 00:49:06,779
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we have a house doctor.

508
00:49:13,184 --> 00:49:18,925
[SPEAKER_00]: And a house doctor is we actually went out and quoted with architectural firms.

509
00:49:19,425 --> 00:49:24,286
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have three architectural firms that are under contract for the city of Medford.

510
00:49:24,806 --> 00:49:31,307
[SPEAKER_00]: So by doing that, I don't have to do a public bid for architectural services.

511
00:49:31,947 --> 00:49:39,328
[SPEAKER_00]: But any construction work, I would have to wind up going out and do a bid process for that.

512
00:49:40,009 --> 00:49:41,909
[SPEAKER_00]: And at this point, if I

513
00:49:42,709 --> 00:49:52,892
[SPEAKER_00]: even ventured into that, it would wind up being null and void because those are only usually valid for 30 days after the bid process is over.

514
00:49:54,093 --> 00:49:56,413
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would actually have to keep re-bidding it.

515
00:49:57,674 --> 00:50:10,438
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not going, you know, that's why it's kind of getting quotes before we start a project is actually very difficult in this circumstance.

516
00:50:11,303 --> 00:50:12,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, but from our perspective.

517
00:50:14,125 --> 00:50:17,206
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing here that proves that these cost 250,000.

518
00:50:17,507 --> 00:50:21,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they cost- Oh, it's probably- And you're asking for 250.

519
00:50:21,128 --> 00:50:26,851
[SPEAKER_03]: What I'm saying is- I'm going to tell you- You must have gotten something from these other contractors that you have on staff.

520
00:50:27,271 --> 00:50:31,133
[SPEAKER_03]: So where's the documentation from them saying the estimate is?

521
00:50:31,673 --> 00:50:35,855
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you that probably the whole project will be a million dollars.

522
00:50:36,955 --> 00:50:42,078
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a realist and the bathroom renovations are not going to be cheap.

523
00:50:43,378 --> 00:51:00,849
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the things that I just wanted to point out in the packet that we received, the budget document I think was actually, it was overwritten by the Heckner Center budget document.

524
00:51:00,889 --> 00:51:01,790
[SPEAKER_09]: Both of them said

525
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:15,660
[SPEAKER_09]: Both of them had the data for Heckner center, so we didn't see that the budget breakdown showing us how much was intended to be for design versus construction and your application.

526
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:20,183
[SPEAKER_09]: So, it's a little bit unclear, but I want to go through all of our questions 1st before.

527
00:51:20,203 --> 00:51:24,266
[SPEAKER_09]: I address some questions.

528
00:51:27,288 --> 00:51:27,549
[SPEAKER_09]: So.

529
00:51:28,549 --> 00:51:28,810
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, so.

530
00:51:35,399 --> 00:51:42,021
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think it's important to address the difference between accessibility and ADA compliance.

531
00:51:42,801 --> 00:51:47,022
[SPEAKER_11]: The city of Medford is not compliant, and that's just the bottom line.

532
00:51:47,702 --> 00:51:50,863
[SPEAKER_11]: And these are state laws and state regulations.

533
00:51:51,343 --> 00:51:58,125
[SPEAKER_11]: The three of us that are in this room submitting the application at this time are submitting them based on our experience.

534
00:51:58,565 --> 00:52:03,786
[SPEAKER_11]: But none of us were here from the beginning to what led to this point.

535
00:52:04,486 --> 00:52:09,847
[SPEAKER_11]: But as a result, under my role and my pet role scope, there has to be compliance.

536
00:52:10,427 --> 00:52:17,689
[SPEAKER_11]: There has to be compliance in some way, shape or form, whether that means it's a loss of bathroom to create the surface area.

537
00:52:18,369 --> 00:52:21,950
[SPEAKER_11]: Additionally, the way this works is going to look different.

538
00:52:22,850 --> 00:52:30,692
[SPEAKER_11]: We're not going to be able to give you votes because the cost of supplies and things that are going to be needed, we don't even know what we're going to find.

539
00:52:31,332 --> 00:52:37,694
[SPEAKER_11]: Paul and myself, prior to Nick coming on board, have actually been having this conversation for a year and a half.

540
00:52:38,794 --> 00:52:43,595
[SPEAKER_11]: It's, who wants to peel back the curtain and go behind the wall?

541
00:52:43,975 --> 00:52:53,857
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, we are in an unfortunate situation where I don't know who did the work previously, but what I can say is that is not how we do work.

542
00:52:54,497 --> 00:53:00,219
[SPEAKER_11]: We also don't decide that urinals don't work, and so we cover them up with bags.

543
00:53:01,479 --> 00:53:16,250
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, the whole point is to start slowly and start to create what is a basic human need, the right to use a bathroom for all people, of all cycles, of all abilities.

544
00:53:17,051 --> 00:53:22,855
[SPEAKER_11]: As far as what is going to go into the bathroom, that is going to be determined by

545
00:53:23,335 --> 00:53:29,802
[SPEAKER_11]: the architectural firm and whatever the ADA standards are at that time.

546
00:53:30,703 --> 00:53:37,690
[SPEAKER_11]: As Paul said, I am mortified to know that I was in that building.

547
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:44,738
[SPEAKER_11]: Obviously, I don't use the men's room, but I was in that building for almost two years and did not know that the toilet paper fixtures

548
00:53:46,281 --> 00:53:48,242
[SPEAKER_11]: We're not even put on properly.

549
00:53:49,082 --> 00:53:51,243
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're dealing with many things here.

550
00:53:51,303 --> 00:53:52,863
[SPEAKER_11]: It's beyond just even the bathroom.

551
00:53:52,883 --> 00:53:56,125
[SPEAKER_11]: There are other aspects of this that one has to consider.

552
00:53:56,165 --> 00:53:58,966
[SPEAKER_11]: There is 80 appropriate voting for lighting.

553
00:54:00,006 --> 00:54:03,467
[SPEAKER_11]: There is high requirements for hand washing.

554
00:54:05,741 --> 00:54:11,384
[SPEAKER_11]: with dimensions, and it's already been determined on one side that we're not going to need that.

555
00:54:11,824 --> 00:54:18,547
[SPEAKER_11]: So I want, as we present this application, for you to put that into your minds.

556
00:54:18,947 --> 00:54:29,012
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, you have processes, but this is when you might have to think out of the box and see how those processes can work with the city's needs, because this is a city need.

557
00:54:29,572 --> 00:54:31,633
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not a personal need.

558
00:54:31,693 --> 00:54:33,674
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not a departmental need.

559
00:54:34,294 --> 00:54:39,737
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a city's need to prevent something from happening that really should not happen.

560
00:54:40,437 --> 00:54:53,403
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's going to take a long time because we, Paul said a million dollars and I just sat back and smiled because every single day the cost of supplies are going up.

561
00:54:54,384 --> 00:54:59,887
[SPEAKER_11]: But I hope that we can start and I'm willing to do one and do it.

562
00:55:00,187 --> 00:55:01,968
[SPEAKER_11]: That's just trying to do all.

563
00:55:03,079 --> 00:55:05,181
[SPEAKER_09]: That is, I'd love to talk.

564
00:55:05,201 --> 00:55:08,783
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate the urgency of this problem.

565
00:55:08,823 --> 00:55:23,354
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no question about the urgency of it, but I think that what we are all concerned about is making sure that we approach it in a way that gets done as much as we need with the resources that we have.

566
00:55:23,815 --> 00:55:31,941
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I think that's the spirit of all the questions that we're asking is to figure out what is the best way that the city's approaching their project.

567
00:55:32,558 --> 00:55:46,241
[SPEAKER_11]: So, as the facilities manager for the city, Paul is in the best place and as an employee with a visible physical disability who uses the bathroom, I think that you have the lived experience.

568
00:55:46,841 --> 00:55:56,083
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just the ADA coordinator coming in from the government side saying it needs to be done and we need to figure out a way in which to do this.

569
00:55:56,573 --> 00:56:02,538
[SPEAKER_11]: But beyond that, I would defer to the experts and I would weigh in on.

570
00:56:03,319 --> 00:56:08,123
[SPEAKER_11]: If a variance is needed, because we just cannot make more service.

571
00:56:09,324 --> 00:56:15,049
[SPEAKER_11]: But we need to stop somewhere to be able to get that ball moving in a more positive.

572
00:56:16,834 --> 00:56:28,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Roberta, this almost sounds like Gillis Park when they were asking for money to do a lot of things and we said we may need to take a step back and do a study of what actually is needed.

573
00:56:28,863 --> 00:56:37,208
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I don't know what Gillis Park is, but there are many, many different tools that you can utilize.

574
00:56:37,789 --> 00:56:42,072
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, it would not be us designing the bathroom, it would be

575
00:56:42,752 --> 00:56:47,553
[SPEAKER_11]: Irreputable company bringing forward a design that is within the school.

576
00:56:47,573 --> 00:57:07,158
[SPEAKER_09]: That's very helpful because actually that and what Mr. Riggi has presented to us this evening was not entirely clear in the application materials that you were looking at a process of having the improvements designed by an architect.

577
00:57:07,858 --> 00:57:12,039
[SPEAKER_09]: So the process that you intend to use was not

578
00:57:13,039 --> 00:57:21,886
[SPEAKER_09]: Clearly spelled out to us until this evening, so bear with all of our questions because we all want to understand so that we can all figure out how this is going to work.

579
00:57:23,007 --> 00:57:27,870
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you 1st of all, I just want to say this seems like an obviously necessary and urgent project.

580
00:57:27,931 --> 00:57:30,412
[SPEAKER_08]: So I appreciate everyone speaking to that.

581
00:57:31,053 --> 00:57:33,835
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, I'll just say I'm newer to the committee.

582
00:57:33,875 --> 00:57:35,917
[SPEAKER_08]: So bear with my novice questions, but.

583
00:57:36,617 --> 00:57:39,739
[SPEAKER_08]: I assume this falls under our.

584
00:57:40,782 --> 00:57:47,687
[SPEAKER_08]: Like jurisdiction in the sense that it's a historical building because otherwise we wouldn't do interior work in a building.

585
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:49,288
[SPEAKER_08]: So my questions are.

586
00:57:49,308 --> 00:57:54,191
[SPEAKER_08]: Is city hall, like, an actual historical building hasn't gone through process.

587
00:57:54,211 --> 00:57:55,092
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my 1st question.

588
00:57:56,007 --> 00:57:58,409
[SPEAKER_08]: or is this kind of a loophole situation?

589
00:57:58,569 --> 00:58:10,678
[SPEAKER_08]: And then my other question is, if that weren't the case, if this were just a city building that needed to be brought up to compliance, like what would Medford do if they didn't have the CPA to fall back on here?

590
00:58:10,798 --> 00:58:14,500
[SPEAKER_08]: Like would we be using, like where would that funding come from?

591
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:23,767
[SPEAKER_08]: The only reason I'm asking that is because it does seem surprising to me being newer to the committee that this type of project would fall to us

592
00:58:25,723 --> 00:58:28,005
[SPEAKER_08]: as opposed to a different funding stream.

593
00:58:29,767 --> 00:58:34,211
[SPEAKER_08]: So again, bear with my like novice questions, but I just wanna, I'm just curious about that.

594
00:58:35,207 --> 00:58:41,248
[SPEAKER_09]: To your first question, there isn't a loophole for determining that this is a historic building.

595
00:58:41,328 --> 00:58:59,132
[SPEAKER_09]: They went to the Historical Commission and actually yesterday, last night, the Historical Commission made a determination that this is a historic building and they've submitted a letter to us with comments about the historic

596
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:08,171
[SPEAKER_09]: the historic merit of the building and the project and things that they would like to see incorporated into the project.

597
00:59:09,992 --> 00:59:14,955
[SPEAKER_09]: And to the second question, that's... That's the story of Medford.

598
00:59:15,455 --> 00:59:26,202
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, finding funding for these projects, and feel free, my colleagues who are on the call to cut me off here, but, you know, funding has always been a scarcity here in the city.

599
00:59:26,462 --> 00:59:28,363
[SPEAKER_07]: With ARPA funding drying up,

600
00:59:29,109 --> 00:59:43,900
[SPEAKER_07]: In 2 and a half short months here, it's going to become even harder for us to find funding, especially for historic preservation projects as my historic friends in the room can attest to finding funds for historic projects is exceedingly hard.

601
00:59:45,741 --> 00:59:53,991
[SPEAKER_07]: So, in terms of it, if there was just a basic non historical city building out there that needed this compliance to be kept up on.

602
00:59:54,832 --> 01:00:02,422
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's some budgeting gymnastics that our facilities director has become very good at, but.

603
01:00:02,802 --> 01:00:18,288
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, since this project is going to be so expansive, it just seems like whatever we fund will be a. Portion of it, but that's just where I'm curious, like, where would Medford turn to for the rest of the project or what would Medford do if this didn't happen to be a historical building.

604
01:00:21,049 --> 01:00:23,210
[SPEAKER_07]: And not to put you on the spot there, Paul, but if you had a.

605
01:00:24,203 --> 01:00:30,973
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's trying to find where those revenue sources are.

606
01:00:32,315 --> 01:00:38,404
[SPEAKER_00]: If it now is the new stabilization fund that was just created by the city council.

607
01:00:40,146 --> 01:00:43,611
[SPEAKER_00]: Any grants out there that may be available.

608
01:00:43,831 --> 01:00:56,548
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I've applied with Francis for a grant for another aspect of City Hall for signage for ADA and also working with the school department.

609
01:00:57,749 --> 01:01:00,911
[SPEAKER_00]: It's looking at any kind of funding stream.

610
01:01:01,011 --> 01:01:15,381
[SPEAKER_00]: But because of the nature of City Hall and being in a historic nature, that's why I'm turning here for the funding stream, because I think it's

611
01:01:18,473 --> 01:01:24,175
[SPEAKER_00]: quicker path to try to obtain some funding to start working on this.

612
01:01:24,315 --> 01:01:36,840
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes when you start working on things, it's interesting how other funding suddenly becomes available because people want to see that project carried through totally.

613
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:44,341
[SPEAKER_00]: But City Hall is a beautiful asset to the city of Bedford.

614
01:01:44,581 --> 01:01:54,863
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can do anything to bring that asset back, I think the residents of Medford would greatly appreciate that.

615
01:01:54,883 --> 01:02:01,245
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to go ahead and share the budget again.

616
01:02:01,265 --> 01:02:03,565
[SPEAKER_07]: I shared it earlier, but let me bring it up here.

617
01:02:03,605 --> 01:02:07,246
[SPEAKER_07]: I apologize if it didn't end up sorted well in the Dropbox.

618
01:02:08,122 --> 01:02:25,008
[SPEAKER_09]: So the total budget costs that's shown here is $250,000, with $100,000 being for this study and $150,000 for most urgent construction.

619
01:02:25,509 --> 01:02:33,852
[SPEAKER_09]: With an understanding, and I think it would be helpful if this budget was an honest budget and showed a million dollars in the bottom right.

620
01:02:35,565 --> 01:02:42,249
[SPEAKER_09]: Fair and that proposed source we don't know yet for the other $750,000.

621
01:02:43,289 --> 01:02:55,556
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be, I think, help to clear up some of like this form completely filled out would clear up some of the questions that we came with this evening.

622
01:02:55,576 --> 01:03:02,020
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the bottom part of this page would show that we have not yet secured

623
01:03:03,493 --> 01:03:07,375
[SPEAKER_09]: The funding that's needed to complete this project.

624
01:03:07,855 --> 01:03:10,016
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, keeping.

625
01:03:11,417 --> 01:03:14,659
[SPEAKER_09]: Keeping that in mind, it is it's really.

626
01:03:14,679 --> 01:03:19,921
[SPEAKER_09]: So, knowing that we're looking at a project that incorporates.

627
01:03:20,721 --> 01:03:29,726
[SPEAKER_09]: A study and construction really sorts a lot of things out in my mind, because I was trying to figure out what.

628
01:03:30,851 --> 01:03:40,814
[SPEAKER_09]: What does this bathroom look like and how do we know it's going to actually be handicap accessible, be compliant after completing the project.

629
01:03:41,094 --> 01:03:44,475
[SPEAKER_09]: So, now that I know that you're talking about working with an architect, that's helpful.

630
01:03:44,935 --> 01:03:47,456
[SPEAKER_09]: The question that I had was whether the city.

631
01:03:48,236 --> 01:03:54,038
[SPEAKER_09]: Has performed an overall accessibility assessment of city hall.

632
01:03:54,838 --> 01:04:13,184
[SPEAKER_09]: and what else you know where how does the bathroom fit in the context of what city hall needs to be ADA compliant and then does the city have a transition plan right now or is that something that we're working on developing a transition plan?

633
01:04:14,725 --> 01:04:21,227
[SPEAKER_11]: So the city has quite an outdated transition plan with no supportive data that shows where the information

634
01:04:24,328 --> 01:04:31,455
[SPEAKER_11]: 1 thing that needs to be addressed furthermore, as far as the compliance of the bathroom.

635
01:04:31,495 --> 01:04:34,258
[SPEAKER_11]: So, when you look at basic human needs.

636
01:04:34,978 --> 01:04:37,921
[SPEAKER_11]: Using the bathroom is a need that everybody has, right?

637
01:04:38,242 --> 01:04:41,885
[SPEAKER_11]: We have 8 bathroom at city hall out of those 8 backwards.

638
01:04:42,766 --> 01:04:47,971
[SPEAKER_11]: Only, maybe to closely meet any sort of accessibility support.

639
01:04:48,628 --> 01:04:54,252
[SPEAKER_11]: We have staff that actually have to travel to other floors to utilize the back road.

640
01:04:54,613 --> 01:05:00,117
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's just the beginning of addressing many things.

641
01:05:00,878 --> 01:05:02,419
[SPEAKER_11]: City Hall is a beautiful building.

642
01:05:03,099 --> 01:05:08,804
[SPEAKER_11]: However, the signage that we have is no longer compliant.

643
01:05:09,084 --> 01:05:14,288
[SPEAKER_11]: We have signage that's built into the wall that technically should not be there.

644
01:05:15,049 --> 01:05:16,210
[SPEAKER_11]: We're using colors.

645
01:05:16,873 --> 01:05:19,835
[SPEAKER_11]: that are not supportive for people that have visual impairments.

646
01:05:19,995 --> 01:05:21,656
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember, it's a city building.

647
01:05:22,156 --> 01:05:25,438
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody accesses City Hall.

648
01:05:26,199 --> 01:05:32,542
[SPEAKER_11]: We have lighting that is now being addressed, but the lighting is out of code.

649
01:05:33,363 --> 01:05:34,243
[SPEAKER_11]: What does that mean?

650
01:05:34,383 --> 01:05:41,908
[SPEAKER_11]: We're using lighting that can trigger seizures, that trigger migraines for staff, lighting that can't be controlled.

651
01:05:42,288 --> 01:05:44,790
[SPEAKER_11]: However, that has since been addressed through

652
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:51,607
[SPEAKER_11]: or correct me if I'm wrong, through the acquisition of the award of another grant.

653
01:05:52,688 --> 01:05:53,208
[SPEAKER_11]: Correct.

654
01:05:53,649 --> 01:05:53,929
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

655
01:05:53,969 --> 01:05:54,490
[SPEAKER_01]: That's correct.

656
01:05:54,990 --> 01:06:02,840
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's not, it's a, if you look at full accessibility, we're not even going to talk about ADA compliance.

657
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:05,202
[SPEAKER_11]: It is a massive undertaking.

658
01:06:05,603 --> 01:06:06,564
[SPEAKER_11]: So you have to take it.

659
01:06:10,081 --> 01:06:13,746
[SPEAKER_09]: Step at a time is what I'd like to understand.

660
01:06:14,828 --> 01:06:23,060
[SPEAKER_09]: And so when we do the study, the architectural plan for this project,

661
01:06:24,011 --> 01:06:29,055
[SPEAKER_09]: 1 of the things that would be very helpful is for that plan to include some bathing.

662
01:06:29,635 --> 01:06:30,336
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have.

663
01:06:30,356 --> 01:06:40,003
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe what is the 1st year priority that we're going to address and then what is the 2nd year priority and so forth so that.

664
01:06:41,624 --> 01:06:45,727
[SPEAKER_09]: Because obviously you're going to be working over the next couple of years at.

665
01:06:47,153 --> 01:06:54,604
[SPEAKER_09]: Obtaining the funding that you need to complete the whole project, standing on the corner, holding out a hat.

666
01:06:54,624 --> 01:07:02,095
[SPEAKER_09]: So what should we do to have, like, what is the plans for prioritizing?

667
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:07,563
[SPEAKER_09]: The order of operation to undertake that construction project.

668
01:07:08,443 --> 01:07:13,707
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I would say that from from looking at this, the most important thing is the bathroom.

669
01:07:13,727 --> 01:07:21,471
[SPEAKER_11]: That's where the most, but the most out of the 8 that we started, we begin.

670
01:07:21,671 --> 01:07:29,136
[SPEAKER_11]: We started the 1st floor because that is actually the 1 that is utilized the most because people do do come in.

671
01:07:29,787 --> 01:07:37,213
[SPEAKER_11]: So, we would be starting at the first floor and we'd be picking one of the accessible bathrooms to currently start the switch up.

672
01:07:37,233 --> 01:07:48,482
[SPEAKER_11]: The reality is that we, again, it's going to be slow and steady because when we open up the curtain, we then it's what we are going to find behind.

673
01:07:50,146 --> 01:07:50,626
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

674
01:07:51,007 --> 01:07:55,408
[SPEAKER_09]: There's some plan that I'd like to share with you.

675
01:07:55,468 --> 01:08:05,032
[SPEAKER_09]: I can do this after that is for a totally different kind of project, but it's a historic, it's a plan for restoring a historic building.

676
01:08:05,612 --> 01:08:13,135
[SPEAKER_09]: And what I really appreciate about it is how it breaks into high priority, medium priority.

677
01:08:15,887 --> 01:08:21,349
[SPEAKER_09]: Projects to be done and explains, you know, why, why they're prioritized in that way.

678
01:08:21,749 --> 01:08:32,172
[SPEAKER_09]: And to me, it's a really useful tool to assist a funding agency to be able to understand how we're approaching the project.

679
01:08:32,792 --> 01:08:33,132
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm.

680
01:08:34,192 --> 01:08:42,219
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, I want to make sure that it's clear that much of this is also going to be determined by the study.

681
01:08:42,479 --> 01:08:46,763
[SPEAKER_11]: Whilst you might be referring to a study, I'm only using

682
01:08:47,643 --> 01:08:56,087
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm only interested in ADA-related agencies, either with the state or New England ADA Association, because this is not a business.

683
01:08:56,127 --> 01:09:01,550
[SPEAKER_11]: So I need somebody who understands the constraints that we are under, right?

684
01:09:01,590 --> 01:09:05,192
[SPEAKER_11]: If the square footage is the square footage, it's not going to change.

685
01:09:06,633 --> 01:09:13,456
[SPEAKER_11]: So it would probably be the MOD coming in to help or the New England ADA Center.

686
01:09:17,210 --> 01:09:18,811
[SPEAKER_11]: definitely does have to be a plan.

687
01:09:18,871 --> 01:09:22,372
[SPEAKER_11]: It is when I was only thinking one bathroom.

688
01:09:22,392 --> 01:09:27,355
[SPEAKER_11]: You see, you put the eight bathrooms in my head and now I'm feeling overwhelmed on one.

689
01:09:27,675 --> 01:09:30,816
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, when I just think of just even one bathroom.

690
01:09:36,917 --> 01:09:41,241
[SPEAKER_11]: It's deeply, deeply overwhelming because I have to see it every day.

691
01:09:41,421 --> 01:09:48,107
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm walking in every day and I'm seeing the issues and I'm seeing all the things that need to be fixed, many times that by eight.

692
01:09:48,527 --> 01:09:53,411
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I see my police, I see guests trying to find the one that they need.

693
01:09:54,392 --> 01:09:57,493
[SPEAKER_09]: So, this actually, this conversation is very helpful.

694
01:09:58,173 --> 01:10:04,616
[SPEAKER_09]: Because the application again, does not clearly explain, you know, what is our goal.

695
01:10:05,156 --> 01:10:11,718
[SPEAKER_09]: To complete with this 1st grant and if we make it clear that the goal is to.

696
01:10:13,839 --> 01:10:17,520
[SPEAKER_09]: Complete 1 bathroom and the study.

697
01:10:17,540 --> 01:10:21,742
[SPEAKER_09]: The is the architectural plan for.

698
01:10:23,147 --> 01:10:30,150
[SPEAKER_09]: the architectural plan for everything, or maybe a concept plan for everything, and the detailed architectural?

699
01:10:30,590 --> 01:10:39,473
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we would be looking at more of a concept plan, because whoever is going to come in is going to look at the spaces that we have, right?

700
01:10:39,493 --> 01:10:41,474
[SPEAKER_11]: So Paul and I have our own ideas.

701
01:10:41,494 --> 01:10:44,275
[SPEAKER_11]: I know the parameters that I need to meet legally.

702
01:10:44,615 --> 01:10:47,096
[SPEAKER_11]: He knows the parameters that he needs to meet legally.

703
01:10:47,196 --> 01:10:52,478
[SPEAKER_11]: And then you have the aesthetics that go off, you know, that will go into it.

704
01:10:53,353 --> 01:11:06,558
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that it's very important that we preserve the historical nature of this, but at the same time,

705
01:11:07,622 --> 01:11:13,025
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to think about the fact that these bathrooms are going to be here for a very, very long time.

706
01:11:13,125 --> 01:11:16,887
[SPEAKER_11]: And in 30 to 50 years, people still need to be able to use them.

707
01:11:16,947 --> 01:11:22,130
[SPEAKER_11]: And in 30 to 50 years, I will need more assistance, right?

708
01:11:22,190 --> 01:11:26,393
[SPEAKER_11]: So these are all the things that we have to keep in mind and we have to balance out.

709
01:11:27,273 --> 01:11:30,135
[SPEAKER_11]: I will leave it up to the study to determine.

710
01:11:30,556 --> 01:11:45,527
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, we will probably have a wish list, but I think that when the results come back, we will be very limited in what we can do if we want to get it right.

711
01:11:45,827 --> 01:11:46,708
[SPEAKER_11]: Does that make sense?

712
01:11:46,788 --> 01:11:48,109
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we'll be looking at

713
01:11:49,506 --> 01:11:52,787
[SPEAKER_11]: All compliance, but very basic.

714
01:11:53,987 --> 01:12:08,911
[SPEAKER_11]: Because think about it, you've got parents that come in with small children, and you've got three children, and you're trying to figure out how to get to the bathroom, but you can't get the chair to go in, and you can't open the door.

715
01:12:08,971 --> 01:12:12,911
[SPEAKER_11]: And then you open the door, you've got to shove your carriage in there quickly.

716
01:12:12,932 --> 01:12:14,152
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a lot.

717
01:12:14,612 --> 01:12:15,272
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a lot.

718
01:12:15,732 --> 01:12:19,213
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm only going to think about one bathroom, because now I'm going to be

719
01:12:19,757 --> 01:12:20,618
[SPEAKER_11]: overwhelmed.

720
01:12:21,638 --> 01:12:22,739
[SPEAKER_11]: It's Reggie.

721
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:23,920
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

722
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:27,923
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I was trying to listen to Paul.

723
01:12:29,064 --> 01:12:32,987
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you say that you had an architect in-house?

724
01:12:34,246 --> 01:12:38,127
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have one in-house.

725
01:12:39,388 --> 01:12:49,051
[SPEAKER_00]: But what cities and towns can do in Massachusetts is put out bids for what they call a house doctor.

726
01:12:49,691 --> 01:13:03,055
[SPEAKER_00]: And a house doctor is an architectural firm that guarantees pricing for a certain amount of years to the city so they can then work on various

727
01:13:06,535 --> 01:13:15,963
[SPEAKER_11]: So, it's not in-house, like, oh, let's say... So, my question, I've been listening all night, so I'm ready now.

728
01:13:17,845 --> 01:13:19,707
[SPEAKER_11]: Be ready.

729
01:13:19,887 --> 01:13:25,552
[SPEAKER_12]: So, the question is, how much does this architectural doctor cost?

730
01:13:26,451 --> 01:13:27,311
[SPEAKER_12]: How much does that cost?

731
01:13:27,512 --> 01:13:30,933
[SPEAKER_11]: It's already built into a contract that the city has.

732
01:13:31,073 --> 01:13:35,336
[SPEAKER_11]: So, it's not specific just for the.

733
01:13:35,916 --> 01:13:40,518
[SPEAKER_12]: So, could the bathrooms be included in that query?

734
01:13:40,818 --> 01:13:41,139
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

735
01:13:41,239 --> 01:13:44,180
[SPEAKER_11]: So they, we could reach out to them.

736
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:47,942
[SPEAKER_11]: Right because they've already guaranteed pricing.

737
01:13:48,582 --> 01:13:51,204
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, so no, if they've already.

738
01:13:52,404 --> 01:13:55,526
[SPEAKER_12]: Guaranteed pricing and so on and so forth is that included in the ask?

739
01:13:57,389 --> 01:14:05,637
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, so that's a rough estimate of what the architectural services.

740
01:14:05,677 --> 01:14:10,221
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I think so the house doctor is a health doctor to the city.

741
01:14:10,281 --> 01:14:14,566
[SPEAKER_11]: So, any city building that has an architectural need of inquiry.

742
01:14:15,146 --> 01:14:17,709
[SPEAKER_11]: Paul, is it 2 firms or 3 firms that we have?

743
01:14:20,231 --> 01:14:22,193
[SPEAKER_11]: He fell off he's back in there.

744
01:14:24,997 --> 01:14:25,757
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's 3.

745
01:14:25,797 --> 01:14:26,377
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's 3.

746
01:14:26,577 --> 01:14:32,399
[SPEAKER_12]: I have to understand because right now, I don't understand.

747
01:14:32,419 --> 01:14:35,459
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, because we, we funded projects.

748
01:14:36,179 --> 01:14:40,080
[SPEAKER_12]: For other people besides the city that we're not, um.

749
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:46,142
[SPEAKER_12]: Including, like, a historical sets, if you will, so this 1 is a little bit different.

750
01:14:46,242 --> 01:14:47,462
[SPEAKER_12]: It has a little bit different.

751
01:14:48,413 --> 01:14:49,493
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, demographic.

752
01:14:49,513 --> 01:14:54,735
[SPEAKER_12]: So I need to understand how we're going to proceed with this.

753
01:14:55,216 --> 01:14:59,357
[SPEAKER_12]: So if we already have an architect, has the architect looked at this project at all?

754
01:14:59,737 --> 01:14:59,997
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

755
01:15:00,017 --> 01:15:01,458
[SPEAKER_12]: So the architect.

756
01:15:01,718 --> 01:15:04,179
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, my Zoom decided to just close.

757
01:15:04,259 --> 01:15:11,082
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you I was having massive troubles with my laptop, and Zoom just disappeared while I was speaking.

758
01:15:11,562 --> 01:15:12,782
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it just hates my voice.

759
01:15:14,903 --> 01:15:27,427
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, I have not reached out to the architect yet, but once we get a semblance of this project, we'll go forward.

760
01:15:28,908 --> 01:15:40,092
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, once I reach out to the architect, they're going to say this is the fee that's going to be associated with the cost.

761
01:15:40,792 --> 01:15:54,495
[SPEAKER_00]: of doing that and I need to know that I have funding, whether in my budget, whether it's just for a visit or whether it's to go full force for coming up with drawings and concepts.

762
01:15:54,555 --> 01:16:04,378
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to be very careful at this state if I do go out to any outside source for any kind of work that

763
01:16:05,618 --> 01:16:07,519
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to get done.

764
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:17,085
[SPEAKER_00]: But as I was explaining with the house doctors, we have three different architectural firms that are under contract with the city.

765
01:16:17,645 --> 01:16:26,990
[SPEAKER_00]: So any department can use them in the city for any kind of project they have and not have to go through a bid process.

766
01:16:27,471 --> 01:16:28,951
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I understand that.

767
01:16:29,152 --> 01:16:31,033
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not the question I'm asking.

768
01:16:31,053 --> 01:16:35,095
[SPEAKER_12]: The question I'm asking is, we don't know what we got.

769
01:16:35,848 --> 01:16:38,729
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, like you said, we haven't peeled anything off the end.

770
01:16:39,189 --> 01:16:43,730
[SPEAKER_12]: So we don't know a doggone thing about what we have, except that we don't, A, we're not in compliance.

771
01:16:44,370 --> 01:16:48,431
[SPEAKER_12]: B, you've never been to the men's room.

772
01:16:48,491 --> 01:16:51,592
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been in the women's room.

773
01:16:51,632 --> 01:16:54,773
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we know we have some very terrible bathrooms.

774
01:16:55,513 --> 01:16:56,293
[SPEAKER_12]: We do, we do.

775
01:16:56,913 --> 01:17:04,495
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, but I think that, and this is just me, you know, thinking about a project that has to go along.

776
01:17:05,464 --> 01:17:08,285
[SPEAKER_12]: We'd have to know exactly what we're looking to do.

777
01:17:09,305 --> 01:17:17,667
[SPEAKER_12]: From an architectural standpoint, before we do anything, and I know you're saying that it's going to cost.

778
01:17:19,048 --> 01:17:22,809
[SPEAKER_12]: X amount of money for the architectural firm to to even look at it.

779
01:17:23,686 --> 01:17:39,803
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I do want to recall that in our previous project, we were able to very creatively address a situation similar to this, where there was an urgent need.

780
01:17:40,564 --> 01:17:47,487
[SPEAKER_09]: We didn't want them to have to wait to funding rounds to fund the plan 1st and then come back next year for construction.

781
01:17:48,128 --> 01:17:57,592
[SPEAKER_09]: So, for it was for Shiloh church, we awarded an amount of funding that was intended to include both the plan and.

782
01:17:59,093 --> 01:18:11,781
[SPEAKER_09]: Preliminary funding for the most urgent construction, but and the way that that was structured, they had to the condition was that they had to complete the plan 1st, before they could.

783
01:18:14,827 --> 01:18:20,991
[SPEAKER_09]: begin construction because the plan was necessary to identify what the construction was going to be.

784
01:18:21,711 --> 01:18:35,081
[SPEAKER_09]: We didn't know exactly how much the plan cost, but in most cases, for most of the projects that we've done, whether it's open space or historic preservation, the applicants have been able to at least pull a number out of the air.

785
01:18:35,621 --> 01:18:37,442
[SPEAKER_09]: for what the plan would cost.

786
01:18:37,522 --> 01:18:38,122
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you did.

787
01:18:38,162 --> 01:18:41,323
[SPEAKER_09]: You pulled a number out of the air, $100,000 on that budget form.

788
01:18:41,884 --> 01:18:52,428
[SPEAKER_09]: But typically, they have some experience of having done similar projects in the past, so kind of have a ballpark.

789
01:18:53,108 --> 01:19:02,552
[SPEAKER_09]: Or the on-call consultant might be willing to just give a rough ballpark estimate without it being a formal quote.

790
01:19:03,392 --> 01:19:15,842
[SPEAKER_09]: So it would be helpful to know, roughly speaking, how, what is the share of that 250,000 budget that's planned versus construction?

791
01:19:15,862 --> 01:19:26,931
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, I can't, I can't disagree with you at all in that, because right now we have a hole in the ground, if you will.

792
01:19:27,091 --> 01:19:27,431
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

793
01:19:27,511 --> 01:19:29,613
[SPEAKER_12]: And we don't know how much it's going to take to

794
01:19:30,248 --> 01:19:42,636
[SPEAKER_12]: Fill that hole, if you understand what I'm saying, but we, as a commission have to make sure that we take the proper steps to get to where we need to get to.

795
01:19:43,376 --> 01:19:46,238
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm pretty sure that we understand the urgency.

796
01:19:46,478 --> 01:19:48,739
[SPEAKER_12]: We definitely understand the urgency.

797
01:19:50,387 --> 01:20:17,100
[SPEAKER_12]: But with every project that comes to us, we still have a process that needs to be followed, if you will, so that we know that we're presenting City Hall, excuse me, the City Council with a very well thought out plan for use of the funding that we're going to suggest that

798
01:20:17,828 --> 01:20:25,051
[SPEAKER_12]: Right now, I think we're missing that first piece.

799
01:20:26,031 --> 01:20:26,712
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what I think.

800
01:20:27,412 --> 01:20:28,512
[SPEAKER_12]: That's my opinion.

801
01:20:28,653 --> 01:20:33,034
[SPEAKER_09]: A clearer project description is what we're trying to aim for.

802
01:20:33,314 --> 01:20:46,400
[SPEAKER_09]: Not that we want to push back on you about the project, but we want to work with you to develop that clear description that we need to be able to come to a decision about the project.

803
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:48,021
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you have something, Joe?

804
01:20:48,141 --> 01:20:52,124
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to be able to stand in front of the city council and have them approve this.

805
01:20:52,844 --> 01:21:05,474
[SPEAKER_03]: If we don't have any documentation or proof that we know the reasonableness and the somewhat accuracy of the amount of money we're requesting, they're going to send it back to us or say no.

806
01:21:06,054 --> 01:21:09,597
[SPEAKER_03]: So we want to get to yes on that first try.

807
01:21:10,477 --> 01:21:14,620
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, to Ada's point, the other thing is that we want to

808
01:21:15,541 --> 01:21:19,544
[SPEAKER_09]: We know that this is the best source of funding for this project.

809
01:21:19,664 --> 01:21:27,731
[SPEAKER_09]: So looking at the context and understanding why are we asking for CPA funds for this project and not a different funding source?

810
01:21:28,791 --> 01:21:35,517
[SPEAKER_09]: A, maybe you will be lucky and find a quarter somewhere on the ground that you can put toward this project or.

811
01:21:36,517 --> 01:21:43,221
[SPEAKER_09]: If you don't, it will be helpful to make the case that this is the best way to do this project.

812
01:21:43,701 --> 01:21:53,648
[SPEAKER_09]: So there was one other thing that I wanted to address that I was able to read the comments that were shared by the historical commission last night.

813
01:21:54,248 --> 01:22:03,474
[SPEAKER_09]: And one of the things that they stated was that given that the bathrooms still have the original historic fabric, the original marble that you mentioned,

814
01:22:05,035 --> 01:22:19,306
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm curious to know what is the likelihood, and maybe Paul, you might best be able to speak to this, what is the likelihood, because I assume that everything inside the bathrooms needs to be rearranged, moved around.

815
01:22:20,286 --> 01:22:25,710
[SPEAKER_09]: And a lot of the marble is damaged from time.

816
01:22:26,632 --> 01:22:29,975
[SPEAKER_09]: and from things that have been removed and moved around in the past.

817
01:22:30,895 --> 01:22:43,605
[SPEAKER_09]: What is the likelihood that the marble, say the stalls, can be moved and that marble be restored and be in a usable condition?

818
01:22:46,126 --> 01:23:01,763
[SPEAKER_09]: And to what extent will that impact the cost of the project to restore the surfaces in the bathroom to, I don't want to, I'm not sure what word I'm looking for, so that they're not gross.

819
01:23:02,826 --> 01:23:04,547
[SPEAKER_01]: I totally understand what you're saying.

820
01:23:04,567 --> 01:23:07,528
[SPEAKER_09]: Over the years, the marble stalls have been ravaged, and for the most part, they're gone.

821
01:23:22,116 --> 01:23:25,278
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not exist anymore in City Hall.

822
01:23:25,979 --> 01:23:31,082
[SPEAKER_00]: What we are left with, though, for the most part, is we are left with marble walls.

823
01:23:32,022 --> 01:23:43,350
[SPEAKER_00]: And some bathrooms do have marble petitions left where they have metal, you know, the metal stall doors and frames around them.

824
01:23:44,910 --> 01:23:54,392
[SPEAKER_00]: My feeling is definitely we need to try to preserve the walls to the best of our ability, fix them as much.

825
01:23:55,312 --> 01:24:01,173
[SPEAKER_00]: There are ways to plug holes in marble and bring them back to make them look.

826
01:24:01,693 --> 01:24:08,514
[SPEAKER_00]: The floors have not been touched in the bathrooms except for where things have been installed in them.

827
01:24:09,014 --> 01:24:12,315
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to keep the floors and bring them back.

828
01:24:13,895 --> 01:24:24,040
[SPEAKER_00]: If we did have opportunities to save marble stalls in any of the bathrooms, I would love to be able to do that.

829
01:24:24,901 --> 01:24:28,663
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure, though, as we go through this process,

830
01:24:30,624 --> 01:24:39,994
[SPEAKER_00]: if the size of them would work in current code, even for non-ADA requirements.

831
01:24:41,215 --> 01:24:48,002
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all, unfortunately, everything we do with a project this size is going to go to current

832
01:24:50,564 --> 01:24:54,789
[SPEAKER_00]: plumbing code, any kind of code, not only ADA.

833
01:24:55,950 --> 01:24:57,692
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to look at that.

834
01:24:57,813 --> 01:25:09,906
[SPEAKER_00]: But if there was a way that we could salvage and save some of the original, believe me, I'm a big proponent of that.

835
01:25:10,747 --> 01:25:20,774
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, I was working on a different project where some, you know, at for actually for city hall and somebody said, why don't we put vinyl windows in?

836
01:25:20,814 --> 01:25:24,196
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just looked at them say, I don't think so.

837
01:25:24,216 --> 01:25:26,158
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so we.

838
01:25:27,299 --> 01:25:40,411
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear what you're saying, and it's my mission to try to save as much of the original fixtures and beauty of that building as possible.

839
01:25:42,333 --> 01:25:49,640
[SPEAKER_00]: I was one of the people that said, hey, I really think City Hall does need to be a historical place because

840
01:25:50,562 --> 01:25:56,093
[SPEAKER_00]: I fear that somebody could come in as a mayor and say, I hate this woodwork on the second floor.

841
01:25:56,134 --> 01:25:56,875
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to paint it.

842
01:25:57,977 --> 01:25:59,380
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's not registered,

843
01:26:00,294 --> 01:26:02,115
[SPEAKER_00]: Technically, that can be done.

844
01:26:02,515 --> 01:26:10,037
[SPEAKER_00]: So I love old buildings, and I love preserving them if I can and if it's practical.

845
01:26:10,137 --> 01:26:20,300
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is our chance that, yes, if there are anything original that are in those bathrooms that we can save and preserve,

846
01:26:21,080 --> 01:26:23,042
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to be part of this project.

847
01:26:23,503 --> 01:26:30,169
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to be part of this, because that's part of the character of City Hall, are those marble walls.

848
01:26:30,229 --> 01:26:30,630
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.

849
01:26:31,451 --> 01:26:33,793
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

850
01:26:34,113 --> 01:26:43,403
[SPEAKER_12]: So, Paul, in the architectural rendering, would you advise that particular individual or firm that

851
01:26:44,088 --> 01:26:51,036
[SPEAKER_12]: We wanted to reclaim as much as we possibly could, and they would include that in their in their assessment.

852
01:26:51,477 --> 01:26:59,947
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, yes, that would that would definitely be I would not take any suggestions of, you know.

853
01:27:00,688 --> 01:27:07,553
[SPEAKER_00]: totally gutting the bathrooms unless it was somehow structurally, we had to do that.

854
01:27:08,373 --> 01:27:09,454
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think so.

855
01:27:10,815 --> 01:27:13,617
[SPEAKER_00]: City Hall, the way it's built, it's structurally sound.

856
01:27:13,737 --> 01:27:19,781
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those walls, those floors, as far as I'm concerning, they're staying.

857
01:27:20,441 --> 01:27:28,707
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we could even go back to fixtures that have that look of when City Hall was built and meet current codes,

858
01:27:29,427 --> 01:27:36,212
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to do that, too, as far as sinks and, you know, toilets and anything else, lights.

859
01:27:36,493 --> 01:27:49,002
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we could go back to what it kind of looked like when it first opened that building, I would love to get that look, as long as it was, you know, met current codes.

860
01:27:49,042 --> 01:27:53,166
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen people do that in certain buildings where they've brought

861
01:27:54,018 --> 01:28:00,422
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the old look back, but with all the modern, you know, modern.

862
01:28:00,502 --> 01:28:06,726
[SPEAKER_12]: Because we've already determined that we only have two bathrooms that would truly fall into compliance.

863
01:28:07,286 --> 01:28:19,273
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but I mean the look of, you know, a sink if it, you know, that has that style of from when the building was built and the light, that kind of thing.

864
01:28:21,305 --> 01:28:22,706
[SPEAKER_09]: So, we share the same goal.

865
01:28:22,886 --> 01:28:34,272
[SPEAKER_09]: That's that's the important thing is that I think should the committee vote to recommend this project will want to have a clear project description.

866
01:28:34,292 --> 01:28:36,113
[SPEAKER_09]: It will be helpful if.

867
01:28:37,029 --> 01:29:02,546
[SPEAKER_09]: we're able to back up with an understanding of why this funding source, and we'll want to perhaps include a condition that the original material be preserved as much as possible in the bathrooms, with an understanding that the dimensions of the bathrooms and the cost of restoration may be factors that we ultimately have to

868
01:29:05,523 --> 01:29:07,984
[SPEAKER_09]: may affect our ability to meet that goal.

869
01:29:08,024 --> 01:29:10,846
[SPEAKER_09]: But to the extent we can, we should look to try to do it.

870
01:29:11,486 --> 01:29:12,607
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a problem for me.

871
01:29:13,787 --> 01:29:14,207
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

872
01:29:15,388 --> 01:29:19,050
[SPEAKER_09]: This was a big discussion, so take a breath.

873
01:29:19,810 --> 01:29:24,613
[SPEAKER_09]: And is there anything else that anyone wanted to add about the city hall bathrooms?

874
01:29:27,434 --> 01:29:31,076
[SPEAKER_09]: Then we're ready to move on to the Heckner Center.

875
01:29:35,737 --> 01:29:36,177
[SPEAKER_09]: Good for you.

876
01:29:36,257 --> 01:29:36,877
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

877
01:29:36,897 --> 01:29:40,778
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much for being here this evening.

878
01:29:40,818 --> 01:29:42,079
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you all for having me.

879
01:29:42,739 --> 01:29:46,020
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been a very long day up here.

880
01:29:46,860 --> 01:29:48,740
[SPEAKER_07]: Been hanging out with you quite a bit today.

881
01:29:48,760 --> 01:29:49,200
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you all.

882
01:29:49,220 --> 01:29:49,440
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

883
01:30:00,993 --> 01:30:01,693
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

884
01:30:01,713 --> 01:30:02,854
[SPEAKER_10]: Not your jacket, right?

885
01:30:03,014 --> 01:30:03,675
[SPEAKER_12]: No, that was clear.

886
01:30:03,815 --> 01:30:04,055
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

887
01:30:04,075 --> 01:30:05,095
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

888
01:30:05,135 --> 01:30:05,456
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

889
01:30:05,616 --> 01:30:09,938
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not making any complaints.

890
01:30:09,958 --> 01:30:10,438
[SPEAKER_10]: Come next week.

891
01:30:10,639 --> 01:30:11,639
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm talking next week.

892
01:30:11,779 --> 01:30:14,381
[SPEAKER_10]: I said we need to talk.

893
01:30:14,401 --> 01:30:14,781
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

894
01:30:14,821 --> 01:30:16,522
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye, everyone.

895
01:30:16,542 --> 01:30:17,362
[SPEAKER_10]: We're just planting seeds.

896
01:30:31,974 --> 01:30:34,635
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, thank you.

897
01:30:34,815 --> 01:30:39,236
[SPEAKER_09]: So let us hear about the Hagner Center.

898
01:30:44,158 --> 01:30:46,539
[SPEAKER_10]: You're up, Paul.

899
01:30:47,179 --> 01:30:48,559
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.

900
01:30:48,739 --> 01:30:51,700
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all right.

901
01:30:52,001 --> 01:30:58,883
[SPEAKER_00]: The Hagner Center is, the city has received a grant from HUD

902
01:31:00,607 --> 01:31:06,189
[SPEAKER_00]: to establish a resiliency center for the city of Medford.

903
01:31:08,030 --> 01:31:12,151
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there are multiple departments working on

904
01:31:15,426 --> 01:31:18,169
[SPEAKER_00]: making that a reality for the city of Medford.

905
01:31:19,371 --> 01:31:29,743
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only will there be a resiliency center, there will also be a component of recreation there for after-school programming in the building.

906
01:31:31,324 --> 01:31:32,325
[SPEAKER_00]: The Hagner Center,

907
01:31:35,022 --> 01:31:40,063
[SPEAKER_00]: was found to be of some historic significance for the city of Medford.

908
01:31:41,443 --> 01:31:57,386
[SPEAKER_00]: So the size of the grant, I am not sure, is enough for everything that is envisioned for the center.

909
01:31:58,366 --> 01:32:00,947
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I was hoping is that

910
01:32:02,643 --> 01:32:31,354
[SPEAKER_00]: we could have some funding to correct issues in the building that would be part of this body's charge, that we would then not have to rely on the grant and use that grant for other avenues like replacing the HVAC system, replacing the electrical system.

911
01:32:31,894 --> 01:32:49,978
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we could use money to repair the roofs and repair the windows and repair the doors, that frees up money to then go to building systems and upgrading the building as we need for the resiliency center.

912
01:32:52,298 --> 01:32:52,978
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

913
01:32:54,519 --> 01:32:56,019
[SPEAKER_09]: Questions from committee members?

914
01:32:56,699 --> 01:32:57,559
[SPEAKER_01]: How much is the grant?

915
01:32:57,579 --> 01:32:57,559
850. 850?

916
01:33:01,919 --> 01:33:03,681
[SPEAKER_01]: and 150 for the study.

917
01:33:10,606 --> 01:33:15,711
[SPEAKER_03]: So similar question to the previous one, where do we get these estimates from?

918
01:33:17,287 --> 01:33:27,158
[SPEAKER_00]: The estimates are just based off of doing this for 25 plus years of buildings of different sizes.

919
01:33:28,459 --> 01:33:36,408
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is kind of a moving target because it's still evolving.

920
01:33:39,618 --> 01:33:48,609
[SPEAKER_00]: As we discuss this, new things keep coming to the forefront every day.

921
01:33:49,670 --> 01:33:56,097
[SPEAKER_00]: But the things that do not change are the needs for the roof and the doors and the windows.

922
01:33:56,837 --> 01:33:59,540
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, that that is a stack.

923
01:33:59,581 --> 01:34:09,052
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a stagnant thing and let, you know, but as we go on, you know, the costs can go up because if we go on for 2, 3 years as we're developing this.

924
01:34:09,953 --> 01:34:14,859
[SPEAKER_09]: 1 of the things that I think will be helpful for this project will be if you can.

925
01:34:16,087 --> 01:34:24,568
[SPEAKER_09]: define a more specific scope, seeing that CPA is a smaller portion of the overall project cost.

926
01:34:24,628 --> 01:34:30,049
[SPEAKER_09]: And as you just mentioned, you see using it for some of the exterior restoration.

927
01:34:30,690 --> 01:34:43,172
[SPEAKER_09]: Then if you were able to define the specific things that the CPA funds would go toward, that would be helpful for us to wrap our heads around it.

928
01:34:43,192 --> 01:34:43,232
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

929
01:34:47,980 --> 01:34:50,721
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a question about this.

930
01:34:50,781 --> 01:34:51,061
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

931
01:34:53,742 --> 01:35:01,465
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know much about the Heckner Center, except that everyone seems to think that it is like a dilapidated building.

932
01:35:01,545 --> 01:35:10,288
[SPEAKER_08]: And I guess to me, like the estimate of a million feels like it can't possibly cover the cost of what it will take.

933
01:35:10,468 --> 01:35:16,190
[SPEAKER_08]: So I guess I'm just curious, like, is this like a first round of work on this building?

934
01:35:16,231 --> 01:35:17,411
[SPEAKER_08]: Or do we really think that that's

935
01:35:18,873 --> 01:35:19,673
[SPEAKER_08]: what it's going to take.

936
01:35:22,835 --> 01:35:27,477
[SPEAKER_00]: Surprisingly, structurally, the building is in pretty good shape.

937
01:35:29,818 --> 01:35:43,025
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks a little rough on the outside, but when you actually start looking at the structure of the building, it has withstood time, and I think it's

938
01:35:44,402 --> 01:35:49,986
[SPEAKER_00]: basically based on the era of when the building was built.

939
01:35:51,487 --> 01:35:56,511
[SPEAKER_00]: It was built to last, and it's structurally sound.

940
01:35:56,551 --> 01:35:57,851
[SPEAKER_00]: The walls are sound.

941
01:35:58,432 --> 01:35:59,973
[SPEAKER_00]: The floors are sound.

942
01:36:00,954 --> 01:36:13,382
[SPEAKER_00]: So structurally, and so that's why, you know, if you're not putting a lot of money into the structure, it's, you know, the work is,

943
01:36:14,630 --> 01:36:14,970
[SPEAKER_00]: less.

944
01:36:16,131 --> 01:36:27,101
[SPEAKER_00]: If we had massive structural repairs in that building, then maybe we would have to look for other funding sources or

945
01:36:30,188 --> 01:36:46,497
[SPEAKER_00]: do this in multiple years as it is we are talking there are two floors to the Hegner Center and we're only talking about renovating one you know the first floor and making that and then

946
01:36:47,875 --> 01:36:53,999
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, going, having discussions on, okay, then where do we proceed with the second floor?

947
01:36:54,519 --> 01:36:58,421
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do we then go, you know, how do we do the second floor?

948
01:36:58,481 --> 01:36:59,942
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we get funding for that?

949
01:37:00,002 --> 01:37:04,705
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it's another grant or, you know, proceed that down that road.

950
01:37:04,725 --> 01:37:08,107
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is all related to the first floor.

951
01:37:08,848 --> 01:37:10,509
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, for the most part, yes.

952
01:37:10,669 --> 01:37:14,272
[SPEAKER_08]: It's external to the building, but the vision is first floor first.

953
01:37:14,352 --> 01:37:26,982
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was our vision when we walked through the building with the mayor and various other city departments was that we get concentrated on the first floor.

954
01:37:28,543 --> 01:37:30,204
[SPEAKER_08]: What's the elevator situation?

955
01:37:30,725 --> 01:37:32,366
[SPEAKER_00]: There is none in that building.

956
01:37:32,846 --> 01:37:34,608
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that part of a future plan?

957
01:37:35,647 --> 01:37:42,709
[SPEAKER_00]: That was not being discussed.

958
01:37:43,069 --> 01:37:54,491
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things we have to look at is if we are going to be required to put an elevator in, we may just be required to put a handicapped lift in.

959
01:37:55,592 --> 01:38:00,733
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we're not using the second floor, then that requirement is not

960
01:38:01,812 --> 01:38:04,693
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, does not apply, does not attach to us.

961
01:38:05,313 --> 01:38:29,838
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we then, if we do suddenly decide to use the second floor, then yes, we would have to, again, figure out if, you know, to use any kind of federal money, you know, over a certain amount, you know, ADA requirements do start attaching, and then we would have to, you know, go to full ADA requirement.

962
01:38:30,778 --> 01:38:51,713
[SPEAKER_00]: But we would have to make sure the handicap ramp is fixed and up to code that the front entrance has the automatic door openers and any offices created have to be the proper widths and everything for turning radiuses and everything else.

963
01:38:55,215 --> 01:38:59,378
[SPEAKER_08]: The press release that the mayor's office put out when they got the federal

964
01:39:00,425 --> 01:39:08,588
[SPEAKER_08]: grant or whatever appropriations for this building, was the entire time the vision was to just use the first floor?

965
01:39:08,608 --> 01:39:14,349
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that is something we're still looking at.

966
01:39:14,569 --> 01:39:21,672
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's probably 15 to 20 people in a room as we're talking about this process.

967
01:39:22,292 --> 01:39:25,113
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still at the beginning phases of the process.

968
01:39:25,953 --> 01:39:28,694
[SPEAKER_00]: So we haven't, as a group,

969
01:39:29,788 --> 01:39:44,136
[SPEAKER_00]: come together, but there was strong indications from people that we may want to just concentrate on the first floor to ensure that we get everything that

970
01:39:46,397 --> 01:39:52,921
[SPEAKER_00]: we need for what we say are the needs.

971
01:39:53,001 --> 01:40:00,405
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the resiliency center and for space for the recreation department.

972
01:40:01,386 --> 01:40:04,368
[SPEAKER_00]: The second floor would be more offices.

973
01:40:05,428 --> 01:40:12,316
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, other support services, which, you know, everybody was thinking that could wait.

974
01:40:12,396 --> 01:40:14,879
[SPEAKER_00]: That wasn't the pressing need here.

975
01:40:15,280 --> 01:40:21,147
[SPEAKER_00]: The pressing need was for the resiliency center and the space for the REC.

976
01:40:22,539 --> 01:40:43,208
[SPEAKER_09]: It seems to me that the 2nd floor could potentially be a later phase, but then my question is, you know, before we totally plan the 1st floor, could the, the architectural study just provide a concept plan for how you could provide accessibility to the 2nd floor?

977
01:40:43,328 --> 01:40:44,108
[SPEAKER_09]: I assume that.

978
01:40:44,748 --> 01:40:52,531
[SPEAKER_09]: A Lula like we installed in one of our other project sites would be a solution for a building like this.

979
01:40:52,611 --> 01:40:58,113
[SPEAKER_09]: But could that could a Lula be installed in the existing footprint or would you need to.

980
01:40:59,905 --> 01:41:04,950
[SPEAKER_09]: expand the footprint to fit a lift to the second floor.

981
01:41:05,090 --> 01:41:16,320
[SPEAKER_09]: So it'd be helpful to just have the answer to that question in mind before the first floor plans are all laid out so you don't have to.

982
01:41:17,577 --> 01:41:19,278
[SPEAKER_09]: Reverse whatever you decide.

983
01:41:19,338 --> 01:41:23,941
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and no, that's actually a very that's a very smart point.

984
01:41:24,041 --> 01:41:34,168
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's actually a very smart way to do the work because you don't want to spend all this money and then suddenly decide, oh, we're going to have to lose 2 offices because we're putting.

985
01:41:34,688 --> 01:41:38,414
[SPEAKER_00]: an elevator in because we have to meet ADA compliant.

986
01:41:38,814 --> 01:41:48,709
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, it would be something that I would be pushing that if there is future usage of the second floor, even if it's

987
01:41:49,750 --> 01:42:08,667
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 years down the road, that a plan that's created for the first floor would encompass some kind of space or area that could easily become the access point for that compliance up to the second floor.

988
01:42:08,687 --> 01:42:10,028
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

989
01:42:11,487 --> 01:42:22,453
[SPEAKER_09]: And I imagine that the other things that you mentioned, making sure that the entire first floor is accessible, that absolutely has to be part of this space.

990
01:42:23,505 --> 01:42:24,285
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, yes.

991
01:42:24,385 --> 01:42:32,330
[SPEAKER_00]: We, you know, based on the amount of money that's being spent, it's, you know, full compliance would kick in.

992
01:42:33,170 --> 01:42:39,793
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wouldn't do a renovation anyway without ensuring that we had that compliance anyway.

993
01:42:39,974 --> 01:42:43,335
[SPEAKER_00]: I think nowadays you, you need to do that.

994
01:42:44,356 --> 01:42:47,297
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't really usually cost you more money, but you,

995
01:42:49,254 --> 01:42:55,781
[SPEAKER_00]: Win in the long run, if you, if you take that extra time and care to ensure that you have compliance.

996
01:42:58,624 --> 01:43:01,186
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you other questions from committee members.

997
01:43:02,697 --> 01:43:19,493
[SPEAKER_09]: The thing that I wanted is so I understand that the study that was attached to the application was a study that was prepared by somebody else at a different time and that that was just to give us a better understanding of what the space needs are.

998
01:43:20,133 --> 01:43:30,621
[SPEAKER_09]: But one of the things that I wanted to make sure was understood that using CPA funds, it has to be a restoration project.

999
01:43:30,801 --> 01:43:40,729
[SPEAKER_09]: And the word replace shouldn't really enter the vocabulary anywhere, you know, without a very sound reason.

1000
01:43:41,289 --> 01:43:46,253
[SPEAKER_09]: So windows, for example, need to be restored and not replaced.

1001
01:43:47,061 --> 01:43:47,461
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.

1002
01:43:47,641 --> 01:43:52,805
[SPEAKER_00]: Windows restored, doors restored, roof repaired and restored.

1003
01:43:54,025 --> 01:44:00,530
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, the majority of those items are still in good shape.

1004
01:44:01,210 --> 01:44:09,636
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't see a need of, you know, my feeling is if something's still usable and

1005
01:44:10,596 --> 01:44:22,142
[SPEAKER_00]: it's easily to repair and restore, why don't we do that than expending the money to totally get rid of it and replace it with something different?

1006
01:44:24,464 --> 01:44:28,606
[SPEAKER_09]: And I have to ask, what is a resilience center?

1007
01:44:29,743 --> 01:44:44,014
[SPEAKER_00]: The resiliency center correct Teresa correct me if I'm wrong, but it's for residents of Medford to be able to go for any kind of need that they may have.

1008
01:44:45,538 --> 01:45:03,913
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, in any kind of emergency situation, it would also be an emergency operations center for the city, manned by the health department and planning and prevention and outreach.

1009
01:45:04,093 --> 01:45:05,695
[SPEAKER_00]: Outreach and prevention.

1010
01:45:05,735 --> 01:45:09,598
[SPEAKER_00]: With social workers, and so it's basically

1011
01:45:11,366 --> 01:45:21,759
[SPEAKER_00]: Citywide service for social social work and various other services that the city can provide residents.

1012
01:45:22,880 --> 01:45:30,269
[SPEAKER_09]: I love the fact that we're providing a space for this because we very, very much need it, but I'm.

1013
01:45:31,433 --> 01:45:35,315
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not familiar with the public transportation on that side of the city.

1014
01:45:35,675 --> 01:45:41,558
[SPEAKER_07]: There is a bus stop and sidewalks that are 150 feet away.

1015
01:45:41,578 --> 01:45:50,382
[SPEAKER_07]: The Hegner Center, if you're familiar with Gillis Park, Hegner Center was the former field house for Gillis Field.

1016
01:45:51,322 --> 01:45:56,485
[SPEAKER_07]: Right behind or on the other side of Hegner is that Maple Park condominiums.

1017
01:45:56,545 --> 01:45:58,646
[SPEAKER_07]: It's right on the corner of Fulton and Felsway.

1018
01:45:58,666 --> 01:46:01,147
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're familiar with that, bus stop is right in front of it.

1019
01:46:01,770 --> 01:46:11,856
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, and signalize crosswalk at the Fulton and fells way as well as a crosswalk right at the building too.

1020
01:46:12,357 --> 01:46:14,638
[SPEAKER_07]: So, in terms of public transportation and.

1021
01:46:15,975 --> 01:46:17,596
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually one of our better sidewalks.

1022
01:46:17,956 --> 01:46:19,037
[SPEAKER_07]: It's in that area.

1023
01:46:19,177 --> 01:46:28,241
[SPEAKER_09]: And if we provide after-school care at this location, who is providing the after-school care and to whom?

1024
01:46:28,822 --> 01:46:33,144
[SPEAKER_07]: So the after-school programming managed by the recreational department.

1025
01:46:33,584 --> 01:46:33,904
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

1026
01:46:34,325 --> 01:46:36,966
[SPEAKER_07]: And in terms of whom, I'm not sure.

1027
01:46:37,046 --> 01:46:37,886
[SPEAKER_12]: I said really?

1028
01:46:37,947 --> 01:46:41,168
[SPEAKER_08]: I was actually just going to look up the distance between the Robert's and the tree.

1029
01:46:41,208 --> 01:46:43,770
[SPEAKER_12]: The recreation department has the expertise

1030
01:46:45,178 --> 01:46:50,142
[SPEAKER_07]: It's after-school programming, it's not after-school care.

1031
01:46:50,562 --> 01:46:51,383
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay.

1032
01:46:51,523 --> 01:46:52,063
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.

1033
01:46:52,203 --> 01:46:55,406
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be sports, educational components.

1034
01:46:56,026 --> 01:46:58,648
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an eight-minute walk from the Roberts.

1035
01:46:59,769 --> 01:47:01,670
[SPEAKER_08]: My assumption was that it would be like Roberts.

1036
01:47:02,230 --> 01:47:08,495
[SPEAKER_08]: But I don't know, I guess if it's not a formal after-school program, then it could be middle school kids.

1037
01:47:09,216 --> 01:47:09,516
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1038
01:47:09,816 --> 01:47:10,136
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1039
01:47:10,677 --> 01:47:12,238
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I had

1040
01:47:12,852 --> 01:47:20,276
[SPEAKER_09]: I've heard of a funding source that that could potentially benefit after school care, but probably not after school programming.

1041
01:47:20,296 --> 01:47:21,556
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1042
01:47:23,277 --> 01:47:23,537
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1043
01:47:24,298 --> 01:47:26,419
[SPEAKER_08]: Other questions actually, I'm sorry.

1044
01:47:26,459 --> 01:47:27,499
[SPEAKER_08]: I do have a question about that.

1045
01:47:28,340 --> 01:47:34,283
[SPEAKER_08]: Why after school programming through the rep department, as opposed to after school care, which is like, 1 of our most identified needs.

1046
01:47:35,394 --> 01:47:40,736
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, because the rec department needs more space for their afterschool programming.

1047
01:47:41,036 --> 01:47:42,637
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they are maxed out.

1048
01:47:43,297 --> 01:47:48,239
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and there are more parents that are asking for it.

1049
01:47:48,759 --> 01:47:52,981
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a, it's to fill a need, um, for parents in Medford.

1050
01:47:53,481 --> 01:47:57,803
[SPEAKER_00]: So they want, want to be able to expand what they currently have.

1051
01:47:58,823 --> 01:48:03,165
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, you know, bring more programming for, for the,

1052
01:48:07,257 --> 01:48:19,179
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I just, I, as the parent who loves the rec center and I am familiar with their scheduling and how there's, there's not even like a moment where they don't have something scheduled.

1053
01:48:20,520 --> 01:48:28,221
[SPEAKER_08]: There is an entire other set of parents that also have a really significant need for just afterschool care.

1054
01:48:28,401 --> 01:48:32,082
[SPEAKER_08]: And to me, it doesn't seem obvious that this need should supersede that need.

1055
01:48:33,553 --> 01:48:35,633
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not your problem necessarily.

1056
01:48:35,954 --> 01:48:37,094
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I understand.

1057
01:48:37,634 --> 01:48:38,634
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.

1058
01:48:39,934 --> 01:48:51,136
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be a discussion that maybe the mayor needs to hear to see if there's some way somewhere in the city to develop something like that down the road.

1059
01:48:54,117 --> 01:48:59,678
[SPEAKER_07]: I will say that it is a priority whether or not we have the resources available at this moment.

1060
01:49:00,770 --> 01:49:10,878
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been in discussions as the CPA manager with entities and organizations, the schools even, about what can we do to address the need for childcare.

1061
01:49:10,898 --> 01:49:24,929
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's a problem that needs to be addressed in a multiple-pronged way, but I do know that it is a priority of this administration.

1062
01:49:27,261 --> 01:49:32,464
[SPEAKER_07]: But we can obviously ask questions and be more vocal about it.

1063
01:49:33,085 --> 01:49:40,489
[SPEAKER_09]: Certainly, well, this has been really interesting and helpful.

1064
01:49:40,569 --> 01:49:46,453
[SPEAKER_09]: I think, you know, no matter what we use this building for, there's a need for municipal space.

1065
01:49:47,994 --> 01:49:48,314
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, um.

1066
01:49:51,197 --> 01:49:57,563
[SPEAKER_09]: It's this is a necessary 1st step to making this building be usable.

1067
01:49:58,444 --> 01:50:02,428
[SPEAKER_09]: At this stage, so I appreciate this application as well.

1068
01:50:03,468 --> 01:50:12,016
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is a really tough question, but it's going to be in the back of my mind, at least when we come to the deliberation process.

1069
01:50:12,096 --> 01:50:15,580
[SPEAKER_09]: But since you have 2 projects in front of us right now.

1070
01:50:18,473 --> 01:50:27,097
[SPEAKER_09]: And the committee has received applications for funds that exceed the amount of funding available for this funding round.

1071
01:50:29,018 --> 01:50:35,402
[SPEAKER_09]: If we had to award less than what's been requested,

1072
01:50:38,100 --> 01:50:49,472
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a way that we could make a choice between these 2 projects or reduce the amount from what has been requested for these 2 projects?

1073
01:50:51,234 --> 01:50:58,442
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I would say my priority is City Hall bathrooms because that right now doesn't even have a funding source.

1074
01:50:59,763 --> 01:51:03,968
[SPEAKER_00]: Haegner Center does at least have some funding guarantee to it.

1075
01:51:04,609 --> 01:51:11,997
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it had to be cut back on Haegner, you know, to save

1076
01:51:12,978 --> 01:51:16,220
[SPEAKER_00]: the bathrooms at City Hall, then that would be fine with me.

1077
01:51:16,240 --> 01:51:21,925
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I sometimes I'm greedy and say, no, I want everything.

1078
01:51:22,905 --> 01:51:26,948
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, it's I deal with funding all the time.

1079
01:51:27,008 --> 01:51:39,717
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's, you know, it's like juggling and, you know, you don't want to drop anything and you want to make sure that, you know, when you're parsing out things, everybody feels that they have their equal share.

1080
01:51:41,258 --> 01:51:42,259
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's difficult.

1081
01:51:43,099 --> 01:51:44,799
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a difficult time for funding.

1082
01:51:44,859 --> 01:51:46,060
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a difficult time.

1083
01:51:47,320 --> 01:51:48,921
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are getting more expensive.

1084
01:51:49,061 --> 01:51:53,022
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you guys deal with, they're not cheap items.

1085
01:51:53,622 --> 01:51:55,442
[SPEAKER_00]: They're deep-pocketed items.

1086
01:51:56,063 --> 01:51:59,944
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would say City Hall, because right now there is no funding stream.

1087
01:52:01,204 --> 01:52:03,145
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need that in City Hall.

1088
01:52:05,026 --> 01:52:05,886
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to bring that.

1089
01:52:06,066 --> 01:52:13,290
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of plans for other things in that building that I'm working on or trying to work on.

1090
01:52:13,450 --> 01:52:17,471
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to bring City Hall back to its former glory, I think.

1091
01:52:18,832 --> 01:52:19,252
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1092
01:52:22,042 --> 01:52:37,245
[SPEAKER_09]: So, if you're able to generate any more numbers, more specificity on the city hall project about what you're aiming to accomplish with the 1st tranche of funding.

1093
01:52:37,846 --> 01:52:38,947
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be helpful.

1094
01:52:39,247 --> 01:52:42,710
[SPEAKER_09]: So what is the approximate cost of a study?

1095
01:52:42,810 --> 01:52:45,853
[SPEAKER_09]: How much would be going toward construction?

1096
01:52:46,233 --> 01:52:51,217
[SPEAKER_09]: What is the likelihood that what you asked for in the first tranche will at least get us one bathroom?

1097
01:52:52,798 --> 01:53:06,650
[SPEAKER_09]: All of that, it would be because the reason I ask is that it is a lot easier for us to increase the budget now if we need to, or decrease it if that's appropriate,

1098
01:53:08,187 --> 01:53:19,490
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, if we want to decrease the budget, it doesn't really matter, but it is much easier to increase the budget now before it goes to City Council.

1099
01:53:19,950 --> 01:53:25,992
[SPEAKER_09]: After it goes to City Council, we have to go through this whole process all over again and send it to City Council again.

1100
01:53:26,512 --> 01:53:31,774
[SPEAKER_09]: So we want to make sure that that's why we're so specific about the budgets.

1101
01:53:31,814 --> 01:53:36,755
[SPEAKER_09]: We want to make sure that we're committing enough funding to the project to be successful.

1102
01:53:37,507 --> 01:53:38,968
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I hear you.

1103
01:53:39,008 --> 01:53:45,611
[SPEAKER_00]: I can reach out to my architectural firms and see if they can give me at least some kind of ballpark numbers.

1104
01:53:45,851 --> 01:53:50,674
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be really helpful if you can.

1105
01:53:50,694 --> 01:53:59,738
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to hold them to the feet of the fire, but at least if they can give me some ballparks to work with, then I can provide to Teresa.

1106
01:53:59,758 --> 01:54:02,100
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds good.

1107
01:54:02,300 --> 01:54:02,580
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

1108
01:54:04,382 --> 01:54:05,223
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

1109
01:54:05,623 --> 01:54:05,863
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks.

1110
01:54:05,923 --> 01:54:06,543
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1111
01:54:06,663 --> 01:54:06,984
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1112
01:54:07,004 --> 01:54:09,325
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody have a good night tomorrow.

1113
01:54:09,365 --> 01:54:09,585
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1114
01:54:09,665 --> 01:54:20,332
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, so we do have 1 bit of business to go back to to review the meeting minutes from the September.

1115
01:54:20,352 --> 01:54:22,933
[SPEAKER_09]: 10 meeting, would you want me to pull them up?

1116
01:54:22,973 --> 01:54:23,834
[SPEAKER_09]: They were in the drop.

1117
01:54:25,275 --> 01:54:25,755
Yes, sure.

1118
01:54:26,015 --> 01:54:29,137
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, right there.

1119
01:54:35,233 --> 01:54:39,897
[SPEAKER_09]: Are there any comments about the meeting minutes?

1120
01:54:45,402 --> 01:54:47,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Make a motion to accept the meeting minutes.

1121
01:54:49,585 --> 01:54:50,166
[SPEAKER_09]: I second.

1122
01:54:52,688 --> 01:54:55,811
[SPEAKER_09]: Then I will call the roll.

1123
01:54:56,391 --> 01:54:56,731
[SPEAKER_09]: Reggie?

1124
01:54:57,052 --> 01:54:57,292
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1125
01:54:57,832 --> 01:54:58,093
[SPEAKER_09]: Ada?

1126
01:54:58,133 --> 01:54:58,353
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1127
01:54:59,113 --> 01:54:59,454
[SPEAKER_09]: Joan?

1128
01:55:00,034 --> 01:55:00,294
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1129
01:55:01,175 --> 01:55:01,676
[SPEAKER_09]: Kayleen?

1130
01:55:02,536 --> 01:55:02,736
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1131
01:55:03,529 --> 01:55:06,070
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, yes, and myself.

1132
01:55:06,130 --> 01:55:06,350
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1133
01:55:08,791 --> 01:55:18,836
[SPEAKER_09]: So, meeting minutes are accepted and did we want to take a couple of minutes to debrief on what we heard this evening?

1134
01:55:18,856 --> 01:55:25,099
[SPEAKER_09]: Or are we going to save all of the debriefing until November?

1135
01:55:28,990 --> 01:55:35,652
[SPEAKER_12]: quite frankly, we asked enough questions, I think, that we asked enough questions.

1136
01:55:35,672 --> 01:55:38,793
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think we have a pretty good handle on what everybody wants.

1137
01:55:39,694 --> 01:55:55,359
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think what we really need to do now is just kind of put it in the slots where they need to be and, you know, put it in, you know, degree of importance and so on and so forth.

1138
01:55:57,431 --> 01:56:10,429
[SPEAKER_12]: I have my ideas and I'm sure everybody else has their ideas about what's important and what can be presented to the city council after we get finished with our second round.

1139
01:56:10,830 --> 01:56:11,010
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1140
01:56:12,608 --> 01:56:16,150
[SPEAKER_07]: I failed to call it out whenever I shared the meeting packet.

1141
01:56:16,210 --> 01:56:25,796
[SPEAKER_07]: But inside the meeting packet, there is an evaluation form in there, which if you want to make notes about your project, it's a fillable PDF form.

1142
01:56:26,796 --> 01:56:31,519
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a slot for each project on there, as well as what their CPA ask is.

1143
01:56:32,680 --> 01:56:33,681
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's just there.

1144
01:56:34,041 --> 01:56:35,542
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not like homework.

1145
01:56:35,822 --> 01:56:40,305
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just there as a tool to see if that would be helpful for you to keep all of your thoughts in one area.

1146
01:56:41,165 --> 01:56:48,808
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, there is a drop down menu if you feel that this project is a low priority for you personally versus medium or high.

1147
01:56:48,868 --> 01:56:51,449
[SPEAKER_07]: So just trying to make that easier.

1148
01:56:51,489 --> 01:56:58,091
[SPEAKER_07]: Plus there's also a criteria form in there that might be helpful for some of our newer members as well.

1149
01:56:59,172 --> 01:57:01,132
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for putting all that together.

1150
01:57:04,674 --> 01:57:05,134
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyone else?

1151
01:57:07,901 --> 01:57:16,644
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like the first three projects really fit our mission, and the last two a little bit more questionable, but that doesn't speak to the urgency of it.

1152
01:57:16,844 --> 01:57:22,886
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's just an interesting balance, where when Liz was speaking, it was like, yep, check all the boxes, and same with Amanda.

1153
01:57:23,746 --> 01:57:25,727
[SPEAKER_08]: But did that make those projects more urgent?

1154
01:57:25,767 --> 01:57:26,427
[SPEAKER_08]: Not necessarily.

1155
01:57:26,467 --> 01:57:27,388
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's my thought.

1156
01:57:28,508 --> 01:57:34,310
[SPEAKER_07]: I will say that the first three applicants that we heard from, Amanda and Liz from the EU Church,

1157
01:57:34,867 --> 01:57:39,071
[SPEAKER_07]: They have come before CPA before, so I think that they have an idea.

1158
01:57:39,171 --> 01:57:43,235
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they had a experience that helped lean towards that presentation.

1159
01:57:43,455 --> 01:57:51,142
[SPEAKER_07]: But I will definitely follow up with Paul and lend my assistance where we can to get a little bit more of a defined scope.

1160
01:57:54,205 --> 01:57:54,525
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

1161
01:57:54,545 --> 01:57:55,906
[SPEAKER_08]: Is everybody hungry?

1162
01:57:56,827 --> 01:57:57,087
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1163
01:57:57,227 --> 01:57:58,368
[SPEAKER_08]: More like sleepy.

1164
01:57:58,408 --> 01:57:58,589
[SPEAKER_08]: Same.

1165
01:58:00,720 --> 01:58:03,742
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I think we need a motion to adjourn.

1166
01:58:04,282 --> 01:58:05,864
[SPEAKER_03]: So can I just ask a quick question?

1167
01:58:05,884 --> 01:58:15,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we going to be over what our estimated funding is for this year with all of these applications as they're currently?

1168
01:58:16,902 --> 01:58:18,483
[SPEAKER_07]: That is correct.

1169
01:58:18,563 --> 01:58:24,447
[SPEAKER_07]: We have about 2.48 million in our asks right now to a budget of 1.9.

1170
01:58:25,148 --> 01:58:35,715
[SPEAKER_07]: However, there are undesignated funds that is just basically the pennies that we still have some of that funding available, and that's approximately 600,000.

1171
01:58:36,976 --> 01:58:45,922
[SPEAKER_07]: Also in the packet was a financial spreadsheet that kind of abstracted what the asks are, what we have in our coffers, as well as what are budgeted.

1172
01:58:47,754 --> 01:58:53,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking at that and you have the total for all categories at 24, 9, 9, 535.

1173
01:58:55,239 --> 01:58:59,962
[SPEAKER_03]: And then down the bottom, it looks like we have 25.

1174
01:59:01,023 --> 01:59:01,243
[SPEAKER_03]: 14 to 90.

1175
01:59:02,424 --> 01:59:08,809
[SPEAKER_03]: So that made me think that we have a little bit more money available than what's being requested.

1176
01:59:08,889 --> 01:59:10,510
[SPEAKER_03]: But are you saying that's correct?

1177
01:59:11,365 --> 01:59:26,817
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, that's so that's including the undesignated funds, which we had decided last year as a committee that we wanted to hold on to a portion of the funds just to maintain.

1178
01:59:26,897 --> 01:59:27,737
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1179
01:59:28,578 --> 01:59:34,642
[SPEAKER_07]: So, while it's technically available, we had made that decision to keep some in the coffers.

1180
01:59:34,883 --> 01:59:35,063
[SPEAKER_07]: So.

1181
01:59:37,562 --> 01:59:47,571
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's it's there if we want to use it if we feel like it's necessary to use it this funding round or to reduce the asks and then keep that.

1182
01:59:48,091 --> 01:59:51,474
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason we keeping in the, what are we keeping in the undesignated funds?

1183
01:59:51,534 --> 01:59:52,735
[SPEAKER_03]: What did we agree to keep there?

1184
01:59:53,356 --> 01:59:54,157
[SPEAKER_03]: We had agreed to 25.

1185
01:59:58,418 --> 02:00:03,823
[SPEAKER_07]: 225.

1186
01:59:58,638 --> 02:00:03,823
[SPEAKER_07]: 225, 225,000.

1187
01:59:59,319 --> 02:00:03,823
[SPEAKER_07]: So again, there's 630, I believe.

1188
02:00:04,524 --> 02:00:14,495
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's call it, there's like 400,000 available for us to continue to use if we want and hold to our, let's keep 225 in the bank account.

1189
02:00:15,496 --> 02:00:15,697
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1190
02:00:16,665 --> 02:00:18,286
[SPEAKER_08]: That would bring us almost to the football.

1191
02:00:18,487 --> 02:00:18,787
[SPEAKER_07]: Almost.

1192
02:00:19,087 --> 02:00:22,109
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, we could always... How much did we use for emergency this year?

1193
02:00:22,390 --> 02:00:24,611
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, the... Off-cycle?

1194
02:00:24,872 --> 02:00:25,772
[SPEAKER_07]: Off-cycle was $15,000.

1195
02:00:26,393 --> 02:00:27,634
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all?

1196
02:00:27,694 --> 02:00:27,894
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1197
02:00:28,615 --> 02:00:29,395
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all we used?

1198
02:00:29,455 --> 02:00:30,636
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all so far, so far.

1199
02:00:32,458 --> 02:00:43,667
[SPEAKER_07]: The year is still young, Rich, but that was for those, the bike maintenance repair stations at the high school, McGlynn and Andrews.

1200
02:00:44,828 --> 02:00:44,988
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1201
02:00:45,595 --> 02:00:46,816
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you, that's a good point.

1202
02:00:46,976 --> 02:00:50,779
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think that's reflected on there, but I will make that amendment.

1203
02:00:54,823 --> 02:00:55,824
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe it was only 15,000.

1204
02:00:56,124 --> 02:00:57,465
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to close the meeting?

1205
02:00:57,485 --> 02:00:58,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Second.

1206
02:01:00,588 --> 02:01:01,468
[SPEAKER_09]: Not everybody rush.

1207
02:01:02,009 --> 02:01:05,412
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, Edda.

1208
02:01:05,572 --> 02:01:05,812
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1209
02:01:06,072 --> 02:01:06,412
[SPEAKER_09]: Reg.

1210
02:01:06,493 --> 02:01:06,753
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1211
02:01:07,113 --> 02:01:07,473
[SPEAKER_09]: Joan.

1212
02:01:07,954 --> 02:01:08,294
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1213
02:01:09,335 --> 02:01:09,635
[SPEAKER_09]: Ari.

1214
02:01:10,136 --> 02:01:10,476
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1215
02:01:11,196 --> 02:01:11,637
[SPEAKER_09]: Haley.

1216
02:01:12,538 --> 02:01:12,778
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1217
02:01:14,627 --> 02:01:16,230
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's all of us, myself, yes.

1218
02:01:16,931 --> 02:01:20,096
[SPEAKER_07]: So next meeting is on the 22nd.

1219
02:01:21,158 --> 02:01:23,061
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, thank you all so much.
