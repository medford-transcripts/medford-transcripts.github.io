[SPEAKER_06]: The motion passes.

91
00:19:10,392 --> 00:19:14,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Motions, orders and resolutions 25-011 offered by Councillor Scarpelli.

92
00:19:15,567 --> 00:19:21,649
[SPEAKER_06]: Whereas we have received multiple phone calls and emails with the misunderstanding and confusion and fear of tax increases in their recent tax bill.

93
00:19:21,769 --> 00:19:29,892
[SPEAKER_06]: And whereas the city did not educate or prepare residents in the overwhelming tax bill that administration set up immediate listening and education sessions for our residents.

94
00:19:30,392 --> 00:19:40,436
[SPEAKER_06]: And whereas the need to support our most vulnerable members of the community, seniors, veterans, and disabled needing financial support that the city council request a more robust exemption option.

95
00:19:40,876 --> 00:19:43,797
[SPEAKER_06]: And whereas the increased taxes have negatively affected homeowners.

96
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:47,719
[SPEAKER_06]: We as the city council be in the process of a homeowner exemption process.

97
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:56,685
[SPEAKER_06]: And whereas the increasing in our home assessments has surprisingly added to our residents tax bill, we share the abatement process with all residents that need to be educated in this process.

98
00:19:56,965 --> 00:20:06,331
[SPEAKER_06]: And whereas our business community has been negatively affected by the tax increase, we asked the city to find financial relief and creative options that might be possible through grants and fees to alleviate financial hardships.

99
00:20:07,071 --> 00:20:11,894
[SPEAKER_06]: Be it resolved that the city council discuss the concern, overwhelming concerns to our residents dealing with the recent tax bills.

100
00:20:11,934 --> 00:20:12,755
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli.

101
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Council President.

102
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:28,169
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, sometimes time heals all wounds, and I think having these two weeks really allowed our residents to reach out to our assessor and then really grasp the understanding of what's been happening.

103
00:20:28,229 --> 00:20:38,796
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know that, Councilor Bealz, you've done a great job really educating a lot of people that have contacted me in the breakdown of what the

104
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:46,234
[SPEAKER_04]: what the tax implication looked like and making sure they understand the numbers are correct.

105
00:20:46,674 --> 00:21:05,205
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the biggest concern was the knowledge of not understanding the impact of the, you don't want to say, you know, retro, you don't want to use the word retro, but it started back as of July 1.

106
00:21:05,726 --> 00:21:09,268
[SPEAKER_04]: So when people saw their taxes in such a huge increase, they saw

107
00:21:09,988 --> 00:21:15,252
[SPEAKER_04]: the quarters that started from July 1 and then their updated assessments.

108
00:21:15,712 --> 00:21:18,574
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that's what really played a huge impact.

109
00:21:18,594 --> 00:21:33,524
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that, unfortunately, it's I see a lot of very dejected residents, especially senior citizens and homeowners and renters that I've talked to because they've

110
00:21:33,995 --> 00:21:43,544
[SPEAKER_04]: had great relationships with their homeowners and their landlords, and they realize this implication now is going to come down, and everybody's going to feel some pain with this.

111
00:21:44,024 --> 00:21:51,051
[SPEAKER_04]: And like I've said from the get-go, I wasn't against the process if we need an override.

112
00:21:51,131 --> 00:21:55,055
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was educating and informing our residents to

113
00:21:56,616 --> 00:21:59,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Let them know, have them be prepared for this.

114
00:22:00,021 --> 00:22:12,437
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you're talking about a senior citizen on Lawrence Road, a young lady who called me and said that, George, my tax bill this month is $2,800, and living on a fixed income, she doesn't know how.

115
00:22:13,195 --> 00:22:14,056
[SPEAKER_04]: she's going to be able to pay $2,800.

116
00:22:14,636 --> 00:22:20,542
[SPEAKER_04]: Doesn't, when I tell you fair, and that's just been a common, common cry.

117
00:22:20,602 --> 00:22:36,176
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that, you know, I, I appreciate the assessor's office cause they've been super attentive to anybody who's we've shared and they've called, but I think we need to find other avenues as a council to really, um,

118
00:22:38,616 --> 00:22:53,815
[SPEAKER_04]: really educate our residents, especially the most vulnerable and understanding where maybe it's not one offs, but maybe the man's communication team with the finance director with the city assessor that they can truly understand

119
00:22:54,992 --> 00:23:00,213
[SPEAKER_04]: the different options and what's coming down the line in their next tax bill.

120
00:23:01,114 --> 00:23:03,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Something simple as understanding what an abatement is.

121
00:23:03,954 --> 00:23:10,736
[SPEAKER_04]: And I had a great conversation with the former president of the Massachusetts Association.

122
00:23:10,776 --> 00:23:18,238
[SPEAKER_04]: He was great in understanding the process with the abatement and making sure our residents understand that there is an application process

123
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:23,404
[SPEAKER_04]: But understanding it's not an automatic free savings or support.

124
00:23:23,624 --> 00:23:26,428
[SPEAKER_04]: It has to I think our residents have to understand that.

125
00:23:27,523 --> 00:23:47,754
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to go prepared when you go to the assessor, making sure that you bring comparable numbers that you see in homes that are sold in your area, and making sure they're apples to apples, meaning they are relatively the same age of a home, making sure that they're aligned with, when you say three bedrooms, two baths.

126
00:23:48,355 --> 00:23:50,576
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a true balance.

127
00:23:51,216 --> 00:23:52,638
[SPEAKER_04]: preparation for that assessment.

128
00:23:52,718 --> 00:23:58,263
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know that, uh, talk to the city assessor that's on the assessor's page for the abatement.

129
00:23:58,303 --> 00:24:14,379
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that we have, especially with our senior homeowners and disabled and our veterans, I think that what I would request is really, um, with this whole process and is, is really put together as for a, uh,

130
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,183
[SPEAKER_04]: subcommittee and planning permitted.

131
00:24:17,203 --> 00:24:25,600
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's super busy, but trying to find a way that we have a meeting to bring people in and maybe work with the mayor to set up a listening session that

132
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:34,600
[SPEAKER_04]: residents can come here maybe Wednesday night or Friday mornings and just have someone explain to them so they can understand and prepare.

133
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:46,033
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that, I know we've already talked, I've talked to many residents and said that this council is going to be proactive starting in the budget season looking at homeowner exemption this year, something we've never done in the past.

134
00:24:46,574 --> 00:24:51,764
[SPEAKER_04]: And something that the former president of the cess association says, you know, that was in the past, that was voodoo.

135
00:24:51,804 --> 00:24:52,546
[SPEAKER_04]: You just didn't do it.

136
00:24:53,007 --> 00:24:56,174
[SPEAKER_04]: And he said, where you are right now, especially in the situation,

137
00:24:56,893 --> 00:24:59,954
[SPEAKER_04]: he thinks that it's something that we should be looking at very strongly.

138
00:24:59,994 --> 00:25:04,116
[SPEAKER_04]: And as he broke down a lot of the numbers for me, I would concur.

139
00:25:04,176 --> 00:25:22,363
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that looking at other exemptions and asking our state delegation to see how we can maybe look at any other forms of exemptions for our seniors, whether it be through the state or other supports federally that can help with this, I think it's important.

140
00:25:22,383 --> 00:25:23,364
[SPEAKER_04]: And then again,

141
00:25:24,697 --> 00:25:27,018
[SPEAKER_04]: We're seeing so much with our business community.

142
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:36,761
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that they've been getting their butts kicked, something that I'll talk about with the next resolution I put forth with parking.

143
00:25:37,281 --> 00:25:39,122
[SPEAKER_04]: You're seeing so many things put on now.

144
00:25:39,202 --> 00:25:43,423
[SPEAKER_04]: The business community, there has to be something so they're prepared as well.

145
00:25:43,904 --> 00:25:52,987
[SPEAKER_04]: I've talked to one business owner who has been committed to the city of Medford for over 40 years, and he's been a very good landlord to many businesses in the city of Medford.

146
00:25:55,592 --> 00:26:03,398
[SPEAKER_04]: he finds himself prepared for the fact that he has six years left on a lease for six of his businesses.

147
00:26:03,998 --> 00:26:07,221
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's seen an increase of over $20,000 to $40,000.

148
00:26:07,261 --> 00:26:08,182
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are the things that he's

149
00:26:13,013 --> 00:26:28,961
[SPEAKER_04]: He's wealthy in the sense compared to you or I probably, but someone who stayed in the city and just didn't sell these buildings to big developers and didn't move away, but stayed true to the small businesses in Medford.

150
00:26:30,062 --> 00:26:32,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are the businesses that we really want to try to protect.

151
00:26:32,723 --> 00:26:34,504
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not the Starbucks of the world.

152
00:26:34,584 --> 00:26:38,166
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not the Coca-Cola's or the Budweiser's of the world.

153
00:26:38,859 --> 00:26:44,981
[SPEAKER_04]: These are our mom and pop stores that we wanna talk about really supporting and keeping those businesses open in Medford.

154
00:26:45,021 --> 00:27:06,190
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, so with all these, I think it would be beneficial for us as a council to really call for a subcommittee for planning permitting committee that could talk with, maybe bring in the mayor's team with administration, the city assessor,

155
00:27:07,155 --> 00:27:28,174
[SPEAKER_04]: the finance director and ask how we can at least find a path that we can educate and help us in sharing any way we can support our most vulnerable in any avenue we can take financially, whether it be, like I said, a more robust exemption for our seniors or

156
00:27:29,355 --> 00:27:34,139
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, understanding and completing the abatement process to help save some money there.

157
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:40,544
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, the abatement process, because I've talked to some seniors, and like, if I get it, then they don't have to pay taxes.

158
00:27:41,085 --> 00:27:43,066
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, no, no, that's not it.

159
00:27:43,607 --> 00:27:44,868
[SPEAKER_04]: It's understanding the abatement.

160
00:27:44,908 --> 00:27:54,275
[SPEAKER_04]: And I tried to explain to them, if your home is valued, is assessed at $1 million, possibly with the abatement, it might be assessed at $800,000 if it's accepted.

161
00:27:57,857 --> 00:27:59,998
[SPEAKER_04]: depending on what you see with neighboring comps.

162
00:28:00,058 --> 00:28:02,938
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was something that was very interesting.

163
00:28:02,978 --> 00:28:11,500
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, like I said, for me, one of the counselors stood strong against the override for these facts alone.

164
00:28:13,381 --> 00:28:21,643
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is where now you're seeing the impact, just like we're seeing the impact on our federal government, we're seeing in

165
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:31,483
[SPEAKER_04]: most major communities in this country that people aren't prepared.

166
00:28:31,703 --> 00:28:34,564
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that we weren't prepared for the solar ride.

167
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:37,425
[SPEAKER_04]: We really didn't prepare our most vulnerable.

168
00:28:37,645 --> 00:28:41,927
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we can do something to recover that, I would hope this council would support me in that.

169
00:28:41,967 --> 00:28:43,207
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you, Mr. President.

170
00:28:44,247 --> 00:28:45,288
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

171
00:28:45,328 --> 00:28:47,929
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will go in a minute to my fellow councilors.

172
00:28:48,109 --> 00:28:51,890
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just wanted to thank you for a lot of what you just talked about.

173
00:28:53,219 --> 00:28:54,842
[SPEAKER_06]: And mentioning some of the work that I've been doing.

174
00:28:54,882 --> 00:29:01,352
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want to also lift up the assessor's office under assessor Costigan and our assistant assessor.

175
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:05,178
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been working with them before.

176
00:29:05,951 --> 00:29:11,956
[SPEAKER_06]: And after the override on updating information, trying to get more information out, we got those valuations out.

177
00:29:13,397 --> 00:29:14,638
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree, we can always do more.

178
00:29:14,738 --> 00:29:22,084
[SPEAKER_06]: And I do wanna say that I have connected, thanks to a resident who sent over some FAQs from some other communities that were very helpful.

179
00:29:22,565 --> 00:29:31,412
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that the assessor's office is working with the communications team to significantly improve some of the information on the assessing department website.

180
00:29:31,472 --> 00:29:33,554
[SPEAKER_06]: That's making it a little more bite-sized and accessible.

181
00:29:35,613 --> 00:29:39,994
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think also just on the abatements, and I'll look this up as other councilors speak.

182
00:29:40,034 --> 00:29:46,695
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to note that I believe you have to have your application for abatement in by Friday.

183
00:29:46,735 --> 00:29:49,155
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's technically February 1st, which is the deadline.

184
00:29:49,175 --> 00:29:57,577
[SPEAKER_06]: So I will confirm that as other councilors speak, but definitely the information page and just a friendly amendment.

185
00:29:57,757 --> 00:30:01,738
[SPEAKER_06]: I think maybe the administration finance committee might be the place to, if that's fine.

186
00:30:01,958 --> 00:30:02,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever you feel.

187
00:30:02,978 --> 00:30:03,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

188
00:30:03,498 --> 00:30:04,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, whatever you feel more.

189
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:05,420
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

190
00:30:05,701 --> 00:30:06,421
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate it.

191
00:30:06,602 --> 00:30:06,982
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

192
00:30:07,162 --> 00:30:07,383
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

193
00:30:07,463 --> 00:30:17,534
[SPEAKER_06]: I will go to Councilor Lemming, Vice President Collins, Councilor Lazaro, Councilor Callahan for brief comments.

194
00:30:17,814 --> 00:30:18,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Lemming.

195
00:30:20,356 --> 00:30:22,418
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll try to be brief as possible.

196
00:30:22,438 --> 00:30:34,188
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, I'm just putting in the chat right here a zoom chat spreadsheet that was literally I just copied and pasted it from the from something that the assessor gave me.

197
00:30:34,368 --> 00:30:37,431
[SPEAKER_08]: So if folks are

198
00:30:38,967 --> 00:30:44,229
[SPEAKER_08]: see their property tax bills and they're a bit confused about this, then this is a read-only spreadsheet.

199
00:30:44,249 --> 00:30:51,791
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you go to File, Download, then you'll be able to download the spreadsheet and input your FY 25 and 24 assessed home values

200
00:30:54,532 --> 00:31:09,711
[SPEAKER_08]: into under the green column and that should give a breakdown of the of your third and fourth quarter payments as well as the impact from the override and I hope that that can clarify.

201
00:31:11,032 --> 00:31:17,495
[SPEAKER_08]: any confusion that residents might have had when they got their tax bills in January.

202
00:31:18,035 --> 00:31:32,321
[SPEAKER_08]: But at the end of the day, if you add up the Q1 to Q4 tax bills, then it should just add up to that $8.80 per $1,000 of assessed property value instead of 837.

203
00:31:35,102 --> 00:31:38,363
[SPEAKER_08]: But you do have to add up all of them in aggregate.

204
00:31:39,541 --> 00:31:41,943
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, I just wanted to share that resource for folks.

205
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:48,849
[SPEAKER_08]: I put it out over my own mailing list, and I'm just hoping it could be out there for people to look over and mess with to understand the numbers.

206
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:49,510
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

207
00:31:50,571 --> 00:31:52,712
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Lemming, and yes, thank you for putting that together.

208
00:31:52,732 --> 00:31:55,893
[SPEAKER_06]: I did just want to also thank the Assessor's Office.

209
00:31:55,933 --> 00:32:00,454
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been able to set up meetings with residents with the Assessors as well, and those have been helpful.

210
00:32:01,235 --> 00:32:05,376
[SPEAKER_06]: And the abatement deadline is Monday, February 3rd.

211
00:32:06,196 --> 00:32:14,379
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're mailing it in, it has to be postmarked by USPS by February 3rd, or otherwise received by the Assessor's Office for 30 p.m.

212
00:32:14,759 --> 00:32:15,739
[SPEAKER_06]: on Monday, February 3rd.

213
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,280
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Collins.

214
00:32:19,461 --> 00:32:22,943
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, President Behrs, and I appreciate this conversation.

215
00:32:22,963 --> 00:32:40,731
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that a lot of... I'm really glad to see the progress that we've made over the past couple of weeks in seeing the assessor's office do such good work in sharing information about potential abatement programs with any and all residents who need it.

216
00:32:40,771 --> 00:32:47,514
[SPEAKER_18]: I know this is an incredibly busy time of year for the assessor's office, but this is a really critical function of their work as well to connect with residents.

217
00:32:48,795 --> 00:32:49,595
[SPEAKER_18]: who need assistance.

218
00:32:51,256 --> 00:32:57,058
[SPEAKER_18]: And when it comes to the questions that have been coming in from the community, you know, when a person says, hey, I don't understand this.

219
00:32:57,338 --> 00:32:58,139
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm confused.

220
00:32:58,239 --> 00:32:59,279
[SPEAKER_18]: I need more information.

221
00:32:59,339 --> 00:33:00,420
[SPEAKER_18]: That's not a political question.

222
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,680
[SPEAKER_18]: That's just a really human question.

223
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:08,043
[SPEAKER_18]: And so I'm really grateful for the assessor's office for making so much time and freeing up so much energy to

224
00:33:09,023 --> 00:33:10,465
[SPEAKER_18]: field those questions as they come in.

225
00:33:10,525 --> 00:33:14,809
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm grateful to my fellow counselors for helping direct people to the resources that they really need at this time.

226
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:29,323
[SPEAKER_18]: Of course, I think that, you know, this change in our property tax structure was needed, and the process to make sure that everybody understands what comes next is vitally important, and we can't afford to have that be any less robust than it absolutely can be.

227
00:33:29,884 --> 00:33:30,665
[SPEAKER_18]: The same goes for

228
00:33:31,245 --> 00:33:55,261
[SPEAKER_18]: you know, all of these parts that make up our ecosystem of how we deal with property tax bills in the city, whether that's our exemptions, our abatement programs, and then the communications that come, you know, before and after all of this, making sure that people know what their options are, and how to understand and take steps on their property tax bills, regardless of the year, because abatements and exemptions are something that people need year in and year out, whether there's an override or whether there isn't one.

229
00:33:55,801 --> 00:34:06,228
[SPEAKER_18]: just due to the economy that we're in and the nature of rapidly escalating, you know, assessed home values in Medford before or after the override.

230
00:34:07,548 --> 00:34:17,895
[SPEAKER_18]: So I really am glad for the opportunity to focus on that and thank the assessor's office and talk about what the city council can continue to do to make sure that we are supporting city staff in connecting residents with resources.

231
00:34:18,575 --> 00:34:24,177
[SPEAKER_18]: and making sure that all of that information about what to do gets out to the people who it's intended to connect with.

232
00:34:24,897 --> 00:34:30,819
[SPEAKER_18]: I also think that this is the right time to start talking about a residential exemption.

233
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:31,939
[SPEAKER_18]: This is really complicated.

234
00:34:31,979 --> 00:34:35,560
[SPEAKER_18]: A residential exemption would not benefit all residents.

235
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,341
[SPEAKER_18]: It would not even benefit all homeowners.

236
00:34:38,221 --> 00:34:41,902
[SPEAKER_18]: But I do think that we have a responsibility to discuss it and to discuss it seriously.

237
00:34:41,942 --> 00:34:47,783
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that's something that we should start to do in committee at the whole or the administration and finance committee as well.

238
00:34:48,323 --> 00:34:51,584
[SPEAKER_18]: So all that being said, I'm grateful to the councilor for bringing this forward.

239
00:34:51,624 --> 00:34:54,685
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that there's a lot of really, really important and timely topics here.

240
00:34:54,725 --> 00:35:02,267
[SPEAKER_18]: And I would like to put forward a lightly amended version of the paper that I'd be comfortable voting yes on tonight.

241
00:35:02,707 --> 00:35:07,228
[SPEAKER_18]: So I put this forward as a friendly amendment or as a B paper, if the councilor is more amenable.

242
00:35:09,629 --> 00:35:20,835
[SPEAKER_18]: That would be, whereas the city of Medford has expanded all tax exemptions for members of vulnerable communities, including our senior, disabled, and veteran neighbors to the maximum extent allowed under state law.

243
00:35:21,135 --> 00:35:33,923
[SPEAKER_18]: And whereas in the past, state and federal grants have been utilized in the city of Medford to support our local businesses, such as the 2024 Massachusetts vacant storefront program and the 2022 small business facade improvement grant program.

244
00:35:34,903 --> 00:35:49,871
[SPEAKER_18]: Whereas implementing a residential exemption would decrease the tax burden for some residential property owners, be it resolved that the City Council continue to work with the Assessor's Office and the Mayor's Communications Office in sharing information about debatement processes with any and all residents who could benefit.

245
00:35:50,971 --> 00:36:02,998
[SPEAKER_18]: Be it resolved that the City Council craft a Home Rule petition to ask the state to allow us to further expand our tax exemption options for these rural-local groups so that we may offer even greater tax exemption programs than what we are currently allowed to offer.

246
00:36:03,758 --> 00:36:20,043
[SPEAKER_18]: be it further resolved that the City Council meet in the Administration and Finance Committee to discuss a potential residential exemption, and be it further resolved that the City Administration continue to prioritize and pursue any and all state, federal, and private grant opportunities targeted at assisting our business opportunity.

247
00:36:20,063 --> 00:36:26,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Collins for that amendment.

248
00:36:26,525 --> 00:36:27,326
[SPEAKER_06]: We can get back to that.

249
00:36:27,346 --> 00:36:28,506
[SPEAKER_06]: I will go to Councilor Zaro.

250
00:36:30,247 --> 00:36:32,834
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, I just very briefly wanted to.

251
00:36:34,404 --> 00:36:35,384
[SPEAKER_15]: mentioned.

252
00:36:36,885 --> 00:36:42,147
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, I just very briefly wanted to mention that I will be as a function of the Resident Services Committee.

253
00:36:42,207 --> 00:36:46,768
[SPEAKER_15]: We hold listening sessions around the city for various reasons.

254
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:49,929
[SPEAKER_15]: This one will be at the Medford Senior Center on Thursday.

255
00:36:49,949 --> 00:36:56,511
[SPEAKER_15]: It would be a great opportunity if anybody has any other follow-up questions, wants to be directly connected to the Assessor's Office.

256
00:36:57,351 --> 00:37:01,713
[SPEAKER_15]: I can also bring some materials to clear some things up if people have questions about

257
00:37:02,213 --> 00:37:07,597
[SPEAKER_15]: their own situations, but we can continue this conversation there on Thursday at noon.

258
00:37:08,758 --> 00:37:12,360
[SPEAKER_15]: I and maybe Councilor Lemming will be there as well for a listening session.

259
00:37:13,581 --> 00:37:17,644
[SPEAKER_15]: So that would be a great opportunity to talk about this as well.

260
00:37:17,684 --> 00:37:19,986
[SPEAKER_15]: But I thank Councilor Scarbelli for bringing this up.

261
00:37:20,286 --> 00:37:20,566
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

262
00:37:22,067 --> 00:37:24,689
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Lozaro, Councilor Callahan.

263
00:37:24,729 --> 00:37:26,350
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, sorry about the levels.

264
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:27,691
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we're all at school committee levels.

265
00:37:27,751 --> 00:37:28,832
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're louder than John.

266
00:37:31,053 --> 00:37:31,674
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Callahan.

267
00:37:31,932 --> 00:37:32,212
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

268
00:37:32,713 --> 00:37:39,920
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, I do want to thank Councilor Scarfelli for bringing forward a number of ideas that I think are really pertinent to what's happening right now.

269
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,904
[SPEAKER_19]: I know it's quite difficult to get information out to people.

270
00:37:45,305 --> 00:37:49,589
[SPEAKER_19]: And, you know, I do hope that we can do a better job.

271
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:58,832
[SPEAKER_19]: of informing people on a topic that is as important as these overrides and the way that it's going to affect their taxes.

272
00:38:00,732 --> 00:38:01,753
[SPEAKER_19]: There are a number of things in here.

273
00:38:01,773 --> 00:38:05,394
[SPEAKER_19]: I just wanna state where I am on these various different things.

274
00:38:05,734 --> 00:38:08,594
[SPEAKER_19]: The listening and education sessions, I think are fantastic idea.

275
00:38:08,614 --> 00:38:09,515
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm always a fan.

276
00:38:09,575 --> 00:38:13,215
[SPEAKER_19]: I would love to be at them and help as much as I am able to.

277
00:38:13,235 --> 00:38:17,736
[SPEAKER_19]: I believe as I think Vice President Collins

278
00:38:20,277 --> 00:38:31,859
[SPEAKER_19]: mentioned that we have maxed out our ability to the statewide exemptions for our seniors, veterans, disabled, and other communities.

279
00:38:31,919 --> 00:38:39,580
[SPEAKER_19]: I believe that we are already at the max, but I think asking our state representatives what else, what more we can do is a great idea.

280
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:42,961
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm personally in favor of the homeowner exemption.

281
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:49,102
[SPEAKER_19]: I know that not everyone on the council is, or at least I don't want to guarantee that everyone on the council is,

282
00:38:49,862 --> 00:38:57,586
[SPEAKER_19]: I think looking into that and beginning that discussion now so that we are in time to be able to make that decision later in the year is a great idea.

283
00:39:00,047 --> 00:39:07,351
[SPEAKER_19]: Absolutely getting information about the abatement process as quickly as possible in every means possible would be fantastic.

284
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:11,094
[SPEAKER_19]: Any grants and fees that can be used.

285
00:39:11,454 --> 00:39:13,936
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, I certainly am in favor of.

286
00:39:14,337 --> 00:39:20,361
[SPEAKER_19]: So, that is where I said I am in favor of both this proposal as well as the proposal so I will vote for both.

287
00:39:22,163 --> 00:39:22,523
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

288
00:39:22,563 --> 00:39:28,008
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, and it's a right now it's an amendment may not be a paper will get their counselor saying, Thank you.

289
00:39:30,815 --> 00:39:39,060
[SPEAKER_07]: If we go line by line, I more or less agree with counselor Callahan was with one one or two asterisks.

290
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:46,864
[SPEAKER_07]: I do worry that the current language on the floor right now is over politicizing a vote that

291
00:39:48,304 --> 00:39:51,027
[SPEAKER_07]: Many, most of the city took part in.

292
00:39:51,848 --> 00:39:56,913
[SPEAKER_07]: Most of the registered voters of the city took part in and I know that people have their views on that debate.

293
00:39:58,014 --> 00:40:03,419
[SPEAKER_07]: But I want to make sure that what we are passing tonight, it doesn't go against the democratic will of those voters.

294
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:10,771
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's important to note that we did do a lot of outreach and there's always room for improvement.

295
00:40:10,891 --> 00:40:17,332
[SPEAKER_07]: But in in this case, I do think and you know, we've debated this as a city council over and over again.

296
00:40:17,393 --> 00:40:21,613
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't think it's that useful for us to relitigate this issue right now.

297
00:40:22,794 --> 00:40:28,735
[SPEAKER_07]: But it is, you know, it's important to acknowledge that we have come a very long way when it comes to communications in the city.

298
00:40:29,776 --> 00:40:43,752
[SPEAKER_07]: And there is much more work that we are doing, and a lot of the avenues that we have set up are potential avenues, for example, like the listing sessions, are potential avenues for us to take advantage of and improve in the future as well.

299
00:40:45,366 --> 00:40:54,852
[SPEAKER_07]: We do need to serve all of our residents, and I do think it'll be important to hold meetings to improve our communications and to explain really complicated concepts.

300
00:40:56,113 --> 00:41:05,479
[SPEAKER_07]: But at the same time, I'm very grateful to Vice President Collins for presenting a proposed amended language that really gets at the heart of

301
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:21,249
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the more nonpartisan things about this resolution at the same, so carrying out those effects and at the same time using language that I think can unite and be amenable to a large section of the city.

302
00:41:24,385 --> 00:41:25,865
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Sang.

303
00:41:26,645 --> 00:41:34,287
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just wanted to add my two cents, I think moving forward, the residential exemption, which we've discussed in the past is a really good step.

304
00:41:34,647 --> 00:41:52,230
[SPEAKER_06]: And I also just wanna note that I think I agree with pretty much everything that everybody said here, and that while it can be true that we've come a decent way on trying to get information out, and certainly there's more accessible information that there has been before,

305
00:41:53,194 --> 00:42:00,035
[SPEAKER_06]: that also when unforced errors happen, that doesn't breed confidence, especially among people who are concerned.

306
00:42:01,356 --> 00:42:09,417
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that we could have gone a long way here if a letter had gone out in water and sewer bills and tax bills and a link to resources that do exist that are on the website.

307
00:42:10,317 --> 00:42:11,117
[SPEAKER_06]: And that didn't happen.

308
00:42:11,177 --> 00:42:19,259
[SPEAKER_06]: And so like, I share the opinions of both of my colleagues to my right, that things are better than they have been before.

309
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:24,844
[SPEAKER_06]: but they're not good enough, and we could have done better and can continue to do better.

310
00:42:25,044 --> 00:42:27,667
[SPEAKER_06]: So I will recognize Councilor Scarpelli.

311
00:42:28,107 --> 00:42:29,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, President Villescaz.

312
00:42:30,789 --> 00:42:36,014
[SPEAKER_04]: It's sad that it seems like everything Councilor Scarpelli is gonna put forth has a negative connotation.

313
00:42:36,074 --> 00:42:42,239
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm a little disappointed in my colleague that, again, this has nothing, this is what it is.

314
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:47,564
[SPEAKER_04]: And by Councilor Sang bringing forth the process of this being some sort of

315
00:42:48,223 --> 00:42:51,184
[SPEAKER_04]: political, whatever, whatever comment you made.

316
00:42:51,984 --> 00:42:53,925
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the biggest issue you want to talk about.

317
00:42:54,305 --> 00:42:55,646
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to talk about unifying.

318
00:42:56,326 --> 00:42:57,787
[SPEAKER_04]: You're just not listening to the community.

319
00:42:58,387 --> 00:43:05,890
[SPEAKER_04]: This resolution was put forth because the community feels that the city administration didn't do enough work to educate our most vulnerable.

320
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:08,611
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's funny how you just want to spin it back.

321
00:43:08,691 --> 00:43:14,713
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's dividing just, just so you know, this is what the community keeps calling me.

322
00:43:15,489 --> 00:43:22,075
[SPEAKER_04]: and saying, why does it always have to be opposite?

323
00:43:22,836 --> 00:43:27,420
[SPEAKER_04]: Why can't you just understand that what I put out here is very simple.

324
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:36,868
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very precise in understanding that this is what the community has called, this is what they wanted me to express, that they weren't informed.

325
00:43:37,268 --> 00:43:41,212
[SPEAKER_04]: And to sit there that this is a divide, of course it's a divide.

326
00:43:42,128 --> 00:43:50,496
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't done anything lately that hasn't had an issue with communication, lack of communication, lack of transparency.

327
00:43:51,277 --> 00:43:52,278
[SPEAKER_04]: That's been across the board.

328
00:43:52,298 --> 00:43:54,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you been involved in the last five meetings?

329
00:43:55,501 --> 00:44:04,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything that we've gotten with the mayor sitting here talking to us and trying to throw smoke screens at us.

330
00:44:06,125 --> 00:44:15,411
[SPEAKER_04]: to last week's meeting with charter review to tonight to the to the override, like I said, and not again, the override questions biggest thing was transparency and educating our community.

331
00:44:16,772 --> 00:44:22,335
[SPEAKER_04]: So to turn this around again to be you know let's let's make a political again we just made a political Justin and tell you what.

332
00:44:23,141 --> 00:44:27,625
[SPEAKER_04]: keep doing what you're doing because that's what's dividing this community because it's a lack of communication.

333
00:44:27,705 --> 00:44:43,257
[SPEAKER_04]: People feel that this council just isn't listening and all if all you did tonight was just went through the vote and we took two votes and we voted yes we would have had something positive going on tonight but instead we got to come back to this and say that

334
00:44:43,897 --> 00:44:47,460
[SPEAKER_04]: that this was meant in some sort of political negative way.

335
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:52,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Listen to what the city is saying, not your city, the complete community.

336
00:44:53,284 --> 00:44:54,866
[SPEAKER_04]: They're saying we're not listening to them.

337
00:44:56,467 --> 00:44:57,448
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, President Pierce.

338
00:44:58,589 --> 00:44:59,729
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councillor Scarpelli.

339
00:45:02,972 --> 00:45:04,733
[SPEAKER_06]: We keep having the same argument over and over again.

340
00:45:05,794 --> 00:45:10,478
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it's because some people in the city feel one way and some people in the city feel the other.

341
00:45:11,499 --> 00:45:12,039
[SPEAKER_06]: And so,

342
00:45:13,682 --> 00:45:23,527
[SPEAKER_06]: some people feel how you've represented Councilor Scarpelli, and I've heard from some of them, and some people feel how you feel, Councilor Sang, and I've heard from them, and some people feel how some of my other councilors are represented tonight.

343
00:45:24,708 --> 00:45:40,817
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a diversity of opinion in this community, and, you know, we can do our best to make the decisions that we feel represents the best interest of the city, and listen to folks, but we're not always gonna agree with everybody.

344
00:45:41,917 --> 00:45:43,178
[SPEAKER_06]: In any case, you know,

345
00:45:44,695 --> 00:45:52,803
[SPEAKER_06]: I can understand how everyone here feels that some of the language they didn't agree with, and some of the comments they didn't agree with, right?

346
00:45:52,963 --> 00:45:54,444
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how we're all feeling, I think, right now.

347
00:45:57,307 --> 00:45:58,047
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the work.

348
00:45:59,188 --> 00:46:00,730
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have proposals before us.

349
00:46:01,991 --> 00:46:04,033
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate what everyone has said.

350
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:08,397
[SPEAKER_06]: We do have a proposed amendment by Vice President Collins.

351
00:46:08,837 --> 00:46:10,459
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli, do you accept the amendment?

352
00:46:13,744 --> 00:46:14,765
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a B paper, okay.

353
00:46:14,785 --> 00:46:19,827
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll take a B paper from Vice President Collins and then the A paper from Councilor Scarpelli.

354
00:46:23,028 --> 00:46:25,890
[SPEAKER_06]: On the B paper by Vice President Collins, is there any further discussion?

355
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:28,971
[SPEAKER_06]: Council Vice President Collins.

356
00:46:34,794 --> 00:46:36,695
[SPEAKER_06]: Great, I mean, we're gonna go to public participation next.

357
00:46:36,815 --> 00:46:42,438
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll go to public participation on this paper, the B paper and the A paper.

358
00:46:43,461 --> 00:46:44,301
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll start at the podium.

359
00:46:44,321 --> 00:46:46,122
[SPEAKER_06]: We do have a hand raised on Zoom.

360
00:46:46,222 --> 00:46:47,283
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone will have three minutes.

361
00:46:48,204 --> 00:46:48,944
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll go to the podium.

362
00:46:48,964 --> 00:46:50,165
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address for the record, please.

363
00:46:51,205 --> 00:46:51,765
[SPEAKER_16]: Good evening.

364
00:46:51,825 --> 00:46:53,506
[SPEAKER_16]: Nick Giurleo, 40 Robinson Road.

365
00:46:53,526 --> 00:46:57,569
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to just speak briefly tonight in favor of the A paper.

366
00:46:57,589 --> 00:47:03,252
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think the simple reason is that, really, this is something that we should be discussing, right?

367
00:47:03,372 --> 00:47:08,274
[SPEAKER_16]: Medford, in its entire history, never approved a Prop 2.5 override before.

368
00:47:08,574 --> 00:47:12,777
[SPEAKER_16]: So really, regardless where you fall on the issue, it is an unprecedented time.

369
00:47:13,457 --> 00:47:13,997
[SPEAKER_16]: for all of us.

370
00:47:14,297 --> 00:47:23,679
[SPEAKER_16]: And as Councillor Scarpelli represented, you know, there seems to be some legitimate concerns across the city among residents as to, you know, what will the impact of this be.

371
00:47:23,699 --> 00:47:26,860
[SPEAKER_16]: And the reality is taxes have gone up for everyone.

372
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:30,501
[SPEAKER_16]: And there is a huge cost of living crisis in the country.

373
00:47:30,521 --> 00:47:34,022
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's really going to be harder now for members of our community to make

374
00:47:34,662 --> 00:47:35,463
[SPEAKER_16]: ends meet.

375
00:47:36,324 --> 00:47:41,608
[SPEAKER_16]: This council talks often about affordability and how they're concerned about affordability, so let's do it.

376
00:47:41,688 --> 00:47:43,089
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's talk about affordability.

377
00:47:43,669 --> 00:47:53,437
[SPEAKER_16]: And we really do have to continue to think of the impact, especially on the most vulnerable of the community, like the elderly, veterans, people who are suffering from disabilities.

378
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:55,218
[SPEAKER_16]: They face unique challenges.

379
00:47:55,318 --> 00:47:56,179
[SPEAKER_16]: They deserve to be heard.

380
00:47:57,405 --> 00:48:01,447
[SPEAKER_16]: So I really wouldn't see any kind of legitimate reason to have to go with the B paper here.

381
00:48:01,607 --> 00:48:03,228
[SPEAKER_16]: I think the A paper is innocuous enough.

382
00:48:03,348 --> 00:48:04,229
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think it's political.

383
00:48:04,249 --> 00:48:06,610
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it can be approved on its own.

384
00:48:07,951 --> 00:48:18,456
[SPEAKER_16]: And just generally, you know, as for unhappiness over, I would say, the outcome of the election, while I personally think it's justified, I mean, I agree that really this was a decision of the voters.

385
00:48:18,736 --> 00:48:25,280
[SPEAKER_16]: So, you know, if you're not happy with the outcome, express that unhappiness at the ballot box in November.

386
00:48:26,223 --> 00:48:32,228
[SPEAKER_16]: It seems like we have a pretty significant difference of opinion here as to how are we going to meet city funding needs.

387
00:48:32,368 --> 00:48:39,853
[SPEAKER_16]: So if you don't like the fact that these overrides passed, show up in November and vote out of office to people who supported them.

388
00:48:40,153 --> 00:48:41,614
[SPEAKER_16]: Express that unhappiness.

389
00:48:42,455 --> 00:48:43,876
[SPEAKER_16]: That's kind of how democracy works.

390
00:48:44,276 --> 00:48:47,098
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's what I'll be doing, and I would encourage everyone else to do.

391
00:48:47,799 --> 00:48:48,399
[SPEAKER_16]: That's all I have to say.

392
00:48:48,439 --> 00:48:49,100
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for listening.

393
00:48:50,665 --> 00:48:51,526
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. Julio.

394
00:48:52,787 --> 00:48:56,891
[SPEAKER_06]: I do encourage people also to express their happiness, but thank you for your comment.

395
00:48:58,273 --> 00:48:59,354
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to bring a little levity.

396
00:48:59,374 --> 00:49:00,595
[SPEAKER_06]: We keep having big arguments here.

397
00:49:01,876 --> 00:49:04,959
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to go to the Zoom.

398
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,621
[SPEAKER_06]: We have Matthew Page Lieberman on Zoom.

399
00:49:07,662 --> 00:49:08,984
[SPEAKER_06]: Matthew, you have three minutes.

400
00:49:09,044 --> 00:49:10,165
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address for the record, please.

401
00:49:12,618 --> 00:49:15,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Matthew Page Lieberman, 15 Canal Street.

402
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:19,862
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to really thank Councillor Scarpelli for bringing this forward.

403
00:49:21,222 --> 00:49:30,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Last year, I appeared before the Council and I said that we, I was with an organization, I said we would be advocating for this at the state level.

404
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:35,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, it's a housing advocacy organization in the city.

405
00:49:36,989 --> 00:49:43,010
[SPEAKER_03]: The leaders decided to place the organization on a temporary or indefinite hiatus.

406
00:49:44,131 --> 00:49:50,153
[SPEAKER_03]: It is, so there was kind of, that became limited as far as that advocacy would be involved.

407
00:49:51,053 --> 00:49:58,335
[SPEAKER_03]: I do know, I think Councilor Behrs, previously you had said that the council would like to pursue stuff at the state level.

408
00:49:59,815 --> 00:50:04,096
[SPEAKER_03]: and to kind of explore any ways to kind of expand those exemptions.

409
00:50:05,137 --> 00:50:11,078
[SPEAKER_03]: A couple Fridays back was the first early deadline for submitting bills.

410
00:50:11,738 --> 00:50:16,099
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was looking at these, you know, the bills to expand the exemptions.

411
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,580
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wanted to recommend something to you all.

412
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:20,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, there are quite a few of them.

413
00:50:21,061 --> 00:50:25,922
[SPEAKER_03]: And I felt like this would be a process, you know, the counselors would kind of have to evaluate them on their merit.

414
00:50:27,242 --> 00:50:37,705
[SPEAKER_03]: But unfortunately, you know, with the state legislature, a lot of times people just go to the motions, they continue to introduce bills each session, and they don't really do anything to lobby for them.

415
00:50:38,105 --> 00:50:40,506
[SPEAKER_03]: And they never really have any constituencies to back them.

416
00:50:41,926 --> 00:50:47,928
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be nice if the council were to kind of consider them or see what the community is pushing for.

417
00:50:49,028 --> 00:51:02,334
[SPEAKER_03]: But given these kinds of limitations and the likelihood that nothing really passes through the legislature unless leadership supports it, I think that what Councilor Collins is suggesting is really, really valuable alternatives.

418
00:51:03,094 --> 00:51:10,517
[SPEAKER_03]: Therefore, I support both the motion that Councilor Scarpelli has put forward and the solutions that Councilor Collins has introduced.

419
00:51:10,557 --> 00:51:13,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much for everybody advocating for this.

420
00:51:14,919 --> 00:51:16,300
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for your time and your comment.

421
00:51:17,112 --> 00:51:19,573
[SPEAKER_06]: Any further comment on this paper in person or on Zoom?

422
00:51:25,734 --> 00:51:27,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Castaneda, name and address for the record.

423
00:51:27,394 --> 00:51:28,134
[SPEAKER_06]: You have three minutes.

424
00:51:31,235 --> 00:51:37,176
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Councilor Beres, Andrew Castaneda, Cushman Street, East Medford.

425
00:51:39,017 --> 00:51:42,077
[SPEAKER_01]: The shock and awe, the bills have already arrived.

426
00:51:42,657 --> 00:51:45,118
[SPEAKER_01]: I paid mine today, there was some irate,

427
00:51:46,690 --> 00:51:51,733
[SPEAKER_01]: taxpayers at the assessor's office, and the poor girl was catching heck.

428
00:51:52,854 --> 00:52:14,767
[SPEAKER_01]: However, the only solution that I can see to give relief is what I've been pushing for the last 19 years, and that is the owner-occupied, it's not just residential, it's the owner-occupied residential tax exemption.

429
00:52:16,281 --> 00:52:21,985
[SPEAKER_01]: The Mass General Law is MGL Chapter 59, Section 5C.

430
00:52:22,645 --> 00:52:25,407
[SPEAKER_01]: Please, someone, look it up, read it.

431
00:52:25,867 --> 00:52:30,229
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been doing it in Boston, Everett, Malden, Chelsea, Cambridge.

432
00:52:30,950 --> 00:52:39,194
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of all the average homeowner who lived in their house saved three grand, $3,000.

433
00:52:40,655 --> 00:52:42,096
[SPEAKER_01]: In Everett, I believe they saved $2,400.

434
00:52:44,565 --> 00:52:45,926
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not saving zero.

435
00:52:46,646 --> 00:52:48,027
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not saving nothing at all.

436
00:52:48,047 --> 00:52:53,071
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been in business, this proclamation that we can do.

437
00:52:53,611 --> 00:52:56,713
[SPEAKER_01]: And the state house gave us this option.

438
00:52:57,234 --> 00:53:06,100
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine the state senators felt that they had to help the homeowners who've carried the weight for decades.

439
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:11,403
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Councilor Beasley, as you had said, one of my previous 19

440
00:53:12,806 --> 00:53:21,930
[SPEAKER_01]: occasions that you would start this process in May or June because it takes time to figure it out and hire more assessors.

441
00:53:22,911 --> 00:53:26,132
[SPEAKER_01]: And I recommend you do it at the full 35 percent exemption.

442
00:53:26,812 --> 00:53:27,453
[SPEAKER_01]: I am tired.

443
00:53:27,793 --> 00:53:28,173
[SPEAKER_01]: Good night.

444
00:53:30,074 --> 00:53:31,094
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. Cassinetti.

445
00:53:34,095 --> 00:53:35,336
[SPEAKER_06]: Go to Ellen on Zoom.

446
00:53:35,396 --> 00:53:36,737
[SPEAKER_06]: Ellen, name and address for the record, please.

447
00:53:36,757 --> 00:53:37,357
[SPEAKER_06]: You have three minutes.

448
00:53:42,544 --> 00:53:45,708
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm unmuted, but I can't seem to start my video.

449
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:48,612
[SPEAKER_12]: My name's Ellen Epstein.

450
00:53:48,652 --> 00:53:50,294
[SPEAKER_12]: I live at 15 Grove Street.

451
00:53:50,514 --> 00:53:57,663
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just want to go on record as saying that I think that this council listens very carefully.

452
00:53:58,974 --> 00:54:05,236
[SPEAKER_12]: To everyone in Medford, I've watched and been present at meeting after meeting.

453
00:54:06,837 --> 00:54:13,640
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the majority of the counselors listened patiently and carefully and really consider all viewpoints.

454
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:23,903
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just wanted to express another point of view in terms of people not feeling listened to.

455
00:54:24,564 --> 00:54:26,805
[SPEAKER_12]: I feel very listened to by this council.

456
00:54:26,965 --> 00:54:27,745
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much.

457
00:54:29,242 --> 00:54:29,723
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

458
00:54:32,267 --> 00:54:33,669
[SPEAKER_06]: Any further comment on these papers.

459
00:54:38,678 --> 00:54:40,421
[SPEAKER_06]: Seeing none, I'll go to Councilor Lemmon.

460
00:54:42,242 --> 00:54:49,810
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so just looking at the original text, and I just peeked at the B paper, I'm more inclined to support the text of the B paper.

461
00:54:49,950 --> 00:54:54,315
[SPEAKER_08]: With the original text of this resolution, I have mixed feelings about it.

462
00:54:55,616 --> 00:55:04,126
[SPEAKER_08]: Whereas the city did not educate or prepare our residents in their overwhelming tax bill, I do agree that

463
00:55:05,816 --> 00:55:16,960
[SPEAKER_08]: better communication could have been done prior to the release of the third quarter tax bill just to explain to everybody what was happening.

464
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,381
[SPEAKER_08]: So I can get behind that.

465
00:55:19,461 --> 00:55:28,144
[SPEAKER_08]: But the line here, whereas the increased taxes have negatively affected our homeowners, things like that.

466
00:55:28,164 --> 00:55:34,166
[SPEAKER_08]: I worked with a lot of parents who are homeowners who worked very hard to see these passed.

467
00:55:35,475 --> 00:55:44,459
[SPEAKER_08]: I was on Monday night in a meeting with some of the school committee of Melrose who just tried to have an override and it failed.

468
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:48,961
[SPEAKER_08]: And they had to lay off 17 teachers because of that.

469
00:55:49,882 --> 00:55:55,524
[SPEAKER_08]: And in Medford, we didn't have to do that because of those parents who worked so hard to see these overrides passed.

470
00:55:55,644 --> 00:56:00,947
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't think it negatively affected homeowners because

471
00:56:01,925 --> 00:56:06,049
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of those homeowners had kids, and their kids are benefiting by teachers not being laid off.

472
00:56:06,129 --> 00:56:11,233
[SPEAKER_08]: And the homeowners are going to benefit with extra staff in the DBW to repair a road.

473
00:56:11,293 --> 00:56:23,845
[SPEAKER_08]: So again, I definitely think that there could have been more education around the calculation of the tax bills earlier on.

474
00:56:25,322 --> 00:56:38,604
[SPEAKER_08]: and obviously any tax increase will have its upsides and downsides, but I don't see a need to budget inch when I say that we absolutely needed the override and it is doing a lot of good.

475
00:56:38,644 --> 00:56:45,826
[SPEAKER_08]: We had a school committee meeting that involved a budget that was not depressing for the first time in ever.

476
00:56:47,126 --> 00:56:50,587
[SPEAKER_08]: People actually got what they wanted because we actually had extra money to invest in our schools.

477
00:56:50,647 --> 00:56:53,087
[SPEAKER_08]: So the overrides were a good thing.

478
00:56:54,333 --> 00:56:55,013
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all I have to say.

479
00:56:55,353 --> 00:56:56,273
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Lemming.

480
00:56:56,353 --> 00:56:57,334
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli.

481
00:56:59,914 --> 00:57:16,237
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, Mr. President, where, as we have received, I have received multiple phone calls, emails with misunderstanding and confusion from fear of the tax increase from recent tax bills.

482
00:57:19,938 --> 00:57:23,899
[SPEAKER_04]: So some of those people were parents as well with kids in school.

483
00:57:24,977 --> 00:57:26,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of those people were senior citizens.

484
00:57:27,498 --> 00:57:30,739
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of those people were renters that were gonna be affected.

485
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:44,042
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I stated in my resolution is exactly what the residents shared with me to share as a resolution on the council floor.

486
00:57:44,642 --> 00:57:54,265
[SPEAKER_04]: If this council wants to go through again and not listen to what they're saying, because of course this override is gonna help

487
00:57:55,315 --> 00:57:56,576
[SPEAKER_04]: financially help the schools?

488
00:57:56,616 --> 00:57:57,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course it would.

489
00:57:59,077 --> 00:57:59,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody said it wouldn't.

490
00:58:00,278 --> 00:58:11,683
[SPEAKER_04]: The question we were saying throughout this process is slow the process down so we can educate people on the outcome and how it affects everybody.

491
00:58:13,024 --> 00:58:15,505
[SPEAKER_04]: So sure, $7.5 million is going to help.

492
00:58:16,366 --> 00:58:17,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course it's going to help.

493
00:58:19,768 --> 00:58:24,030
[SPEAKER_04]: And just a little tidbit, in the Melrose situation, they were promised

494
00:58:25,564 --> 00:58:34,447
[SPEAKER_04]: support for the school department, the first two overrides they had, and the first two overrides that were passed, the Melrose public school systems failed miserably.

495
00:58:35,367 --> 00:58:41,349
[SPEAKER_04]: So the third time, the citizens finally rose up and said, no way, not again, because they just didn't prove it.

496
00:58:43,070 --> 00:58:45,871
[SPEAKER_04]: So every side has a story.

497
00:58:45,911 --> 00:58:48,312
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, Mr. President, we'll go through the vote again.

498
00:58:49,557 --> 00:58:54,060
[SPEAKER_04]: By the will of the people, by the will of this council, we'll vote yay and nay, and we'll move on.

499
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:55,021
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all.

500
00:58:55,521 --> 00:59:05,628
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, just another example by the comments of my fellow councilors, that they're just not listening to the other side that feel like they're being heard here.

501
00:59:07,149 --> 00:59:08,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you're talking out of both sides of your mouth.

502
00:59:08,990 --> 00:59:11,212
[SPEAKER_04]: You're saying, yes, they need support.

503
00:59:11,252 --> 00:59:12,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we didn't educate them.

504
00:59:12,873 --> 00:59:16,035
[SPEAKER_04]: But yes, but you're too harsh on this resolution.

505
00:59:16,255 --> 00:59:17,296
[SPEAKER_04]: This is their resolution.

506
00:59:17,916 --> 00:59:18,977
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you, Mr. President.

507
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:24,921
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion, B paper, Vice President Khan, seconded by.

508
00:59:27,382 --> 00:59:28,582
[SPEAKER_06]: Seconded by Councilor Zaro.

509
00:59:28,742 --> 00:59:29,423
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

510
00:59:30,623 --> 00:59:31,223
[SPEAKER_06]: Opposed?

511
00:59:31,363 --> 00:59:32,203
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

512
00:59:33,024 --> 00:59:35,284
[SPEAKER_06]: On the A paper of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by.

513
00:59:36,225 --> 00:59:37,345
[SPEAKER_06]: Seconded by Councilor Callahan.

514
00:59:37,365 --> 00:59:38,065
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

515
00:59:38,866 --> 00:59:39,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

516
00:59:40,886 --> 00:59:42,607
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone else just me and Councilor Callahan on that one?

517
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:45,968
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

518
00:59:49,749 --> 00:59:51,710
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I'm going to have to have a roll call on that.

519
00:59:57,132 --> 00:59:58,213
[SPEAKER_09]: roll call on the paper.

520
00:59:59,394 --> 01:00:00,035
[SPEAKER_09]: Council Callahan.

521
01:00:02,236 --> 01:00:03,077
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Collins.

522
01:00:04,779 --> 01:00:05,599
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Lazaro.

523
01:00:07,021 --> 01:00:07,561
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Lemming.

524
01:00:08,622 --> 01:00:09,343
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli.

525
01:00:10,584 --> 01:00:11,124
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Sang.

526
01:00:12,265 --> 01:00:12,866
[SPEAKER_09]: President bears.

527
01:00:12,966 --> 01:00:15,288
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, three in the permanent form the negative emotion fails.

528
01:00:16,586 --> 01:00:42,383
[SPEAKER_06]: two four two five zero one two offered by Councillor Scarpelli a resolution requesting an update on the parking department be it resolved that the Medford City Council get an update on the status of the parking department be it further resolved that the council meet a new parking director at an upcoming meeting be it further resolved the council receive an update on the South Medford G parking program be it further resolved that because multiple residents have expressed displeasure with the appeals process the council request a meeting with the administration to research a more equitable and fair process Councillor Scarpelli.

529
01:00:42,924 --> 01:00:44,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you Mr. President again this is uh

530
01:00:46,635 --> 01:00:49,197
[SPEAKER_04]: that was brought up by the residents of South Medford.

531
01:00:49,257 --> 01:01:00,907
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that they're seeing such a negative impact in their day-to-day living conditions because of some of these processes.

532
01:01:01,287 --> 01:01:13,097
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know that we have a new director of parking, and it would behoove this council, I think, to maybe sit with them

533
01:01:16,070 --> 01:01:28,755
[SPEAKER_04]: move this to a planning and permitting committee that has the traffic protocol under there so we can maybe talk and look at and understand the G-Zone parking program, the pilot program.

534
01:01:29,135 --> 01:01:41,519
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that with that process and the appeals process that's in place right now here in Medford, we're finding that residents are very, very frustrated.

535
01:01:42,119 --> 01:01:43,700
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that

536
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:48,282
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to have an avenue for our residents to express themselves.

537
01:01:48,402 --> 01:01:56,128
[SPEAKER_04]: And what we're seeing right now is the mayor is using traffic and parking as another revenue source.

538
01:01:56,789 --> 01:01:59,631
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, that's on the back of our residents.

539
01:02:00,152 --> 01:02:01,052
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just not fair.

540
01:02:01,513 --> 01:02:04,335
[SPEAKER_04]: You're seeing time and time again, Mr. President, that

541
01:02:04,991 --> 01:02:09,316
[SPEAKER_04]: with increased fees, increased fines, no appeals process.

542
01:02:09,697 --> 01:02:17,306
[SPEAKER_04]: I've talked to a few neighboring communities, talked to their commissioners, their traffic and parking directors, and I gave them scenarios.

543
01:02:17,847 --> 01:02:22,212
[SPEAKER_04]: One scenario was a senior citizen who parked behind

544
01:02:23,550 --> 01:02:28,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Colleen's and unfortunately, she left her handicapped placard on her dashboard.

545
01:02:28,433 --> 01:02:30,415
[SPEAKER_04]: She didn't hang it on the rear view mirror.

546
01:02:30,995 --> 01:02:34,178
[SPEAKER_04]: When she came out, she received a ticket, I believe it was 1201.

547
01:02:34,758 --> 01:02:40,602
[SPEAKER_04]: She got in her car, she drove to the parking department at 1210 and said, this is the situation.

548
01:02:41,263 --> 01:02:43,844
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm handicapped, this is my placard.

549
01:02:44,325 --> 01:02:45,426
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, I didn't hang it.

550
01:02:45,826 --> 01:02:47,487
[SPEAKER_04]: And they said, you can appeal it.

551
01:02:47,987 --> 01:02:51,170
[SPEAKER_04]: So they were generous enough to help her appeal it out front, to walk through the appeal.

552
01:02:51,778 --> 01:02:58,301
[SPEAKER_04]: By the time she got home, she was notified that the appeal didn't go through, and she'd have to pay the ticket.

553
01:02:58,321 --> 01:03:09,666
[SPEAKER_04]: She called City Hall, and I believe at the time, the Chief of Staff was overseeing the process, and her words directly were, there's no gray area here.

554
01:03:09,686 --> 01:03:10,966
[SPEAKER_04]: It's either yes or no, and that's it.

555
01:03:13,705 --> 01:03:15,766
[SPEAKER_04]: neighboring communities, you've talked to their commissioners.

556
01:03:15,886 --> 01:03:19,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, there are gray areas and there are options.

557
01:03:19,568 --> 01:03:32,214
[SPEAKER_04]: So the next option on the appeal would have to go to the courts and on $150 ticket, this resident would then have to pay $250 to then appeal this at the next level so someone can listen to her.

558
01:03:32,775 --> 01:03:37,857
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, one of the most vulnerable members of our community not being heard.

559
01:03:38,497 --> 01:03:38,718
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um,

560
01:03:40,277 --> 01:03:47,768
[SPEAKER_04]: That followed up with many residents of South Memphis calling me and saying, George, listen, I drive my car on the weekends.

561
01:03:48,843 --> 01:03:52,247
[SPEAKER_04]: And sometimes I have to take it out if I need it for work.

562
01:03:52,347 --> 01:04:01,997
[SPEAKER_04]: But then when I come home, I realize that the G-Zone is now permitted to people that aren't residents of Medford because they bought a pass.

563
01:04:02,838 --> 01:04:05,701
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're seeing the anger and the frustration.

564
01:04:05,741 --> 01:04:08,965
[SPEAKER_04]: We're talking about situations with the business community.

565
01:04:11,552 --> 01:04:38,169
[SPEAKER_04]: residents we're talking about supporting our businesses right our local businesses well now let's say you own a real estate company you in medford square you now pay for that pass which is 150 or 125 you pay for that in the past that was good throughout the city now you have to now buy another pass fee to get permitted and then if you have to show a house let's say in west medford so there's so many inequities here and it seems like

566
01:04:39,083 --> 01:04:40,984
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to save small businesses.

567
01:04:41,024 --> 01:04:42,585
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to support our business community.

568
01:04:42,965 --> 01:04:50,209
[SPEAKER_04]: But in the same breath, we're putting in these hurdles and roadblocks and hurting what we're looking for.

569
01:04:50,589 --> 01:04:59,133
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to remember, when the Traffic and Parking Department was implemented, it was made to really support the business community and keeping

570
01:05:02,791 --> 01:05:15,279
[SPEAKER_04]: non-residents from parking, especially on the one-on-one route or the bus route that goes to the express bus, and parking there all day in front of a business, and then these outsiders take a spot for the whole entire day.

571
01:05:15,839 --> 01:05:21,142
[SPEAKER_04]: Now in South Metro, from what I'm being told from the neighbors, there are cars that people don't live in the city.

572
01:05:21,162 --> 01:05:28,407
[SPEAKER_04]: They get parking, they walk to the green line, they're gone all day, their car's in front of their house, and then they come home, they don't have parking.

573
01:05:29,195 --> 01:05:35,377
[SPEAKER_04]: because we've then, you know, we've sold their spot, we've rented their spot in front of their home.

574
01:05:35,977 --> 01:05:50,162
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a lot of concerns, you know, there are so many others that come to mind that I think that we really need to sit down with the traffic department and the new director and get some clarity so we can help these residents.

575
01:05:50,222 --> 01:05:56,424
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that, like, again, I think the G zone, it has to be some clarity in where the pilot program's going from here.

576
01:05:59,152 --> 01:06:13,558
[SPEAKER_04]: The appeals process that there has to be something in place that someone in-house walks through, at least looks at an appeal, that it's something that's blatant that could support our resident, especially most vulnerable, that we have that in place.

577
01:06:14,738 --> 01:06:19,480
[SPEAKER_04]: We look at our business community and even invite Chamber of Commerce to that

578
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:26,623
[SPEAKER_04]: to the meeting if we can, Mr. President, to a subcommittee meeting and get their input to see where we're going.

579
01:06:26,643 --> 01:06:38,449
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that these are very important issues and I hope this council will support me, at least with this one, that we ask to go to a subcommittee meeting in planning and permitting to see what we can do to

580
01:06:39,923 --> 01:06:59,301
[SPEAKER_04]: educate ourselves, help educate the community, and then at the same time add any input that we can that at least the homework that I've done from neighboring communities that were very, very simple, simple ads that really, really could change a lot and really support our community.

581
01:06:59,321 --> 01:07:00,402
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you, Mr. President.

582
01:07:00,962 --> 01:07:02,424
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Vice President Collins.

583
01:07:03,425 --> 01:07:04,166
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, President Behrs.

584
01:07:04,186 --> 01:07:06,448
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli for putting this forward.

585
01:07:06,468 --> 01:07:09,510
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that this is a really important resolution.

586
01:07:09,550 --> 01:07:17,257
[SPEAKER_18]: I think this is another issue where we can do a lot of good by doing a better job at getting to the community the information that is out there.

587
01:07:17,698 --> 01:07:21,301
[SPEAKER_18]: I've also been communicating with residents about the GLX parking zone.

588
01:07:21,361 --> 01:07:22,102
[SPEAKER_18]: I live in that zone.

589
01:07:22,122 --> 01:07:23,343
[SPEAKER_18]: I know I'm not the only councilor who does.

590
01:07:24,504 --> 01:07:31,850
[SPEAKER_18]: I have seen both the pros and the cons firsthand, most especially when I try to park my car after getting home from a city council meeting at 1 a.m.

591
01:07:31,890 --> 01:07:39,837
[SPEAKER_18]: and then circling down the block three to five times and then parking on a cross street, which is now legal to do, which is great, but the circling is not the fun part.

592
01:07:40,017 --> 01:07:44,882
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway, I've been communicating with residents who have been noticing the types of changes that I have.

593
01:07:45,622 --> 01:07:51,164
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's been helpful for me to the extent of my knowledge, explain the pros and the cons and the why of the new program.

594
01:07:51,184 --> 01:07:53,545
[SPEAKER_18]: But obviously this is something that our parking department should be doing.

595
01:07:53,585 --> 01:07:56,266
[SPEAKER_18]: This is something that our communications department should be doing.

596
01:07:56,526 --> 01:08:03,909
[SPEAKER_18]: And there are a lot of residents who still have questions and still have a hard time finding what the policies are and where they are on the website.

597
01:08:04,529 --> 01:08:11,612
[SPEAKER_18]: Recently, a resident came to me with a parking policy that was indeed on the city website that I had never heard of before.

598
01:08:12,492 --> 01:08:13,613
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think this is a good thing.

599
01:08:14,094 --> 01:08:16,295
[SPEAKER_18]: It would be great for the council to meet the new parking director.

600
01:08:16,495 --> 01:08:18,877
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd be happy to host this in the planning and permitting committee.

601
01:08:18,917 --> 01:08:20,598
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd also be happy for this to be a committee of the whole.

602
01:08:21,899 --> 01:08:25,562
[SPEAKER_18]: But I think that this is a, you know, whichever the council prefers, I'll support.

603
01:08:25,602 --> 01:08:27,143
[SPEAKER_18]: I think this will be a productive conversation.

604
01:08:27,343 --> 01:08:27,624
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

605
01:08:28,084 --> 01:08:28,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

606
01:08:28,744 --> 01:08:29,365
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Sang.

607
01:08:30,906 --> 01:08:31,286
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

608
01:08:31,907 --> 01:08:34,068
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli for introducing this.

609
01:08:34,088 --> 01:08:35,349
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you'll find that

610
01:08:37,034 --> 01:08:39,075
[SPEAKER_07]: that I support this resolution wholeheartedly.

611
01:08:39,095 --> 01:08:54,021
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that you've brought up really, really important things that, and Councilor Collins has too, that I've been hearing from my neighbors and residents who live in South Bedford and the whole side as well.

612
01:08:54,361 --> 01:09:01,303
[SPEAKER_07]: I live on the border of that zone and like Councilors Collins and Scarpelli, I do see the positives and the negatives.

613
01:09:03,427 --> 01:09:17,086
[SPEAKER_07]: There, you know, a lot of the reasons why this was put into place was to anticipate the arrival of the Green Line extension to make parking enforcement easier because we had a lot of varying rules that made that enforcement very difficult to

614
01:09:19,748 --> 01:09:22,850
[SPEAKER_07]: a lot of the intention behind this policy, I think is good.

615
01:09:23,150 --> 01:09:37,395
[SPEAKER_07]: And we are seeing some of that fruit, but at the same time, a lot of residents are picking up on some negatives about the system and some complaints that I do think we should address and that we should field.

616
01:09:38,155 --> 01:09:45,538
[SPEAKER_07]: With a new parking director in the city, this is a good time for us to all meet together to have this community conversation.

617
01:09:46,078 --> 01:10:01,374
[SPEAKER_07]: But the Green Line Zone, I also find that this resolution is written in a way that is quite neutral as to the contents of the policy itself and does speak to the sentiments of a lot of our residents.

618
01:10:01,654 --> 01:10:02,916
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I'd be happy to support this.

619
01:10:03,676 --> 01:10:05,078
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Sand, Councilor Lazaro.

620
01:10:07,144 --> 01:10:09,164
[SPEAKER_15]: I also am in favor of this resolution.

621
01:10:09,184 --> 01:10:11,285
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's an important discussion to have.

622
01:10:11,326 --> 01:10:21,490
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it would be a great thing to discuss in committee, and I echo what Councilor, or Vice President Collins said about meeting the parking director.

623
01:10:21,510 --> 01:10:22,631
[SPEAKER_15]: I would be very eager to do that.

624
01:10:23,491 --> 01:10:26,393
[SPEAKER_15]: I've also heard a lot of things from residents about the frustration with the parking.

625
01:10:26,413 --> 01:10:30,615
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you for bringing this forward, Councilor Schiaparelli, and I'm in favor of it.

626
01:10:30,955 --> 01:10:31,255
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

627
01:10:31,915 --> 01:10:32,275
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

628
01:10:34,575 --> 01:10:35,996
[SPEAKER_06]: Any further comments from members of the council?

629
01:10:37,576 --> 01:10:42,238
[SPEAKER_06]: Seeing none, I just wanted to say that I also believe that we should have a meeting with the new director.

630
01:10:42,958 --> 01:10:43,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Lemming.

631
01:10:45,059 --> 01:10:46,720
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I was just gonna recommend that.

632
01:10:47,780 --> 01:10:49,501
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, recommend what?

633
01:10:49,521 --> 01:10:49,741
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

634
01:10:50,281 --> 01:10:50,441
What?

635
01:10:50,741 --> 01:10:51,482
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead.

636
01:10:51,922 --> 01:10:54,663
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I was just gonna recommend to go to admin finance.

637
01:10:56,104 --> 01:10:58,945
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I'd have to look back at the matrix we made.

638
01:11:01,730 --> 01:11:08,397
[SPEAKER_06]: I could see an argument for all three, but I think actually the transportation duties that we transitioned over, this does make more sense to be in the planning and permitting context.

639
01:11:11,339 --> 01:11:12,340
[SPEAKER_06]: Education and Culture Committee.

640
01:11:14,512 --> 01:11:16,334
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, parking is part of the culture here.

641
01:11:16,354 --> 01:11:18,315
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you could send it to Committee of the Whole, then we don't have to have an argument.

642
01:11:18,355 --> 01:11:23,159
[SPEAKER_06]: But I just wanted to say that I do think meeting with a new director is a good idea.

643
01:11:23,179 --> 01:11:32,407
[SPEAKER_06]: I think something, if amenable to folks, that I would like to talk about at the meeting is just, in general, how can residents advocate for access permit parking on their street in general?

644
01:11:32,467 --> 01:11:39,953
[SPEAKER_06]: I know there's a lot of concerns residents have around maybe they do want to set it up, maybe they don't want to set it up, and that would be helpful.

645
01:11:40,433 --> 01:11:41,854
[SPEAKER_06]: I do want to just say that on the fees,

646
01:11:44,167 --> 01:11:58,432
[SPEAKER_06]: we do have reports and there have been communications that we've received and that are available to the public from the parking task force that reviewed the parking policies and established the G zone pilot, which then the parking department, I believe moved from pilot to permanent.

647
01:12:00,072 --> 01:12:04,914
[SPEAKER_06]: And that, you know, there were fees in the city that haven't been updated in 45, 50 years.

648
01:12:05,074 --> 01:12:12,437
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think to me, it is important for the city to maintain with the times

649
01:12:14,148 --> 01:12:14,508
[SPEAKER_06]: fees.

650
01:12:15,188 --> 01:12:17,829
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, on the flip side, we haven't done linkage fees in 40 years, right?

651
01:12:17,889 --> 01:12:29,034
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's really a symptom of a larger problem where the city was not keeping track of its different user fees, different programs for a very long time.

652
01:12:29,094 --> 01:12:31,635
[SPEAKER_06]: And now, yes, we see an increase that's coming in.

653
01:12:31,675 --> 01:12:34,996
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's because the task force said, hey, we haven't done this in 50 years.

654
01:12:35,096 --> 01:12:38,597
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're out of scope with comparable communities in a lot of these things.

655
01:12:38,777 --> 01:12:39,998
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not saying they got everything right.

656
01:12:40,498 --> 01:12:46,784
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not saying there's not stuff that's open for discussion, but that's just something that I think is valuable.

657
01:12:47,084 --> 01:12:54,251
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know that we, I'm hoping we will finally receive the report from all the other departments about their fees that haven't been updated in a long time and how we're going to address that.

658
01:12:54,852 --> 01:12:57,695
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to note also that while we can have

659
01:12:58,275 --> 01:13:02,256
[SPEAKER_06]: the parking director and talk about this with the parking department, the traffic commission makes these choices.

660
01:13:03,537 --> 01:13:07,198
[SPEAKER_06]: We can make recommendations to the traffic commission, but we cannot overrule the traffic commission.

661
01:13:07,238 --> 01:13:14,140
[SPEAKER_06]: The traffic commission is established by a 1957 special act of the state legislature and is the final decision maker.

662
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:17,101
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what the policies of our current parking director are.

663
01:13:17,122 --> 01:13:25,224
[SPEAKER_06]: I know the past parking director said that they do not serve on the traffic commission and they did not want to because they did not feel that they should be making the rules that they enforce.

664
01:13:25,844 --> 01:13:27,005
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if that's a different

665
01:13:27,732 --> 01:13:28,273
[SPEAKER_06]: viewpoint.

666
01:13:28,694 --> 01:13:33,223
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that parking traffic and parking directors and other communities do serve on their traffic commissions.

667
01:13:33,944 --> 01:13:36,809
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, I believe in Somerville a counselor serves on that commission.

668
01:13:36,829 --> 01:13:36,869
[SPEAKER_06]: So,

669
01:13:39,431 --> 01:13:40,052
[SPEAKER_06]: just throwing it out there.

670
01:13:40,072 --> 01:13:47,518
[SPEAKER_06]: If anyone wants to look up that special act, um, that's what is that almost 70 years since we've updated the structure of the traffic commission.

671
01:13:48,019 --> 01:13:53,203
[SPEAKER_06]: And I have heard from, you know, members of the public that maybe that's worth taking a look at as well.

672
01:13:53,764 --> 01:13:56,606
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so just wanted to put those, that information out there.

673
01:13:56,626 --> 01:13:57,687
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll go to councilor Scarpelli.

674
01:13:58,508 --> 01:14:02,872
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, maybe instead of everybody seems to be interested, maybe we do do it.

675
01:14:05,584 --> 01:14:07,406
[SPEAKER_04]: regular scheduled meetings from six to seven.

676
01:14:07,986 --> 01:14:17,656
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we ask the traffic commission, any member that would like to join, because I think maybe that might be an option to revisit and update those processes as well.

677
01:14:18,096 --> 01:14:26,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I know that Somerville does have one of the councils on the commission, so they're sharing what they're hearing directly.

678
01:14:27,795 --> 01:14:28,736
[SPEAKER_04]: So that'd be important.

679
01:14:28,756 --> 01:14:30,877
[SPEAKER_04]: So that'd be my recommendation if you so see it.

680
01:14:31,097 --> 01:14:31,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

681
01:14:31,497 --> 01:14:32,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

682
01:14:33,378 --> 01:14:38,800
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Sang, as amended by Councilor Scarpelli.

683
01:14:39,781 --> 01:14:40,421
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

684
01:14:40,441 --> 01:14:40,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

685
01:14:41,261 --> 01:14:41,601
[SPEAKER_06]: Opposed?

686
01:14:41,621 --> 01:14:42,402
[SPEAKER_06]: The motion passes.

687
01:14:44,490 --> 01:14:57,144
[SPEAKER_06]: 25015 resolution to make city council meetings more business friendly, whereas businesses come before the council to request approval for storefronts, and whereas small business storefronts and our quarter squares and business districts foster a sense of community that residents desire.

688
01:14:57,164 --> 01:14:59,907
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a little loud here.

689
01:15:01,497 --> 01:15:16,104
[SPEAKER_06]: allow our residents to shop small and local and bring needed revenue to the city and whereas we want business owners to understand believe Medford is friendly to small businesses be resolved that the city council's regular meeting agendas here the petitions from businesses prior to resolutions made by members of the council be it further resolved that rule 19 be amended as follows.

690
01:15:16,784 --> 01:15:24,568
[SPEAKER_06]: The following a petition shall be reserved for only matters requiring council action for law including not limited to special permits grants location sign variances and common picture licenses.

691
01:15:25,408 --> 01:15:52,380
[SPEAKER_06]: only petitions filed meeting this criteria shall be assigned a council paper number such hearings and petitions shall be heard immediately after the reading of council reports and before orders and resolutions and motions sponsored by council members i will entertain this but i want to remind councillors that there isn't the order of business currently does this and the only reason that that isn't happening is because we vote on motions to suspend the order of business and that even if we update the rules a majority vote of this body

692
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:55,341
[SPEAKER_06]: can suspend the regular order of business and move us beyond this.

693
01:15:55,422 --> 01:15:58,323
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't personally believe that a rule change is necessary.

694
01:15:59,984 --> 01:16:14,152
[SPEAKER_06]: With that, I don't believe this is out of order, but I just don't believe that any rule change would change the practice and that that is on us as individuals acting collectively to change the practice and just make sure that we do not suspend the rules before taking these.

695
01:16:14,712 --> 01:16:17,974
[SPEAKER_06]: I will go to Councilor Lazaro and then Councilor Lemming.

696
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:19,075
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

697
01:16:22,057 --> 01:16:22,517
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Lazaro.

698
01:16:23,233 --> 01:16:23,653
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

699
01:16:23,673 --> 01:16:45,015
[SPEAKER_15]: I am willing to, well, I'm willing to withdraw this if it is unnecessary because the rules do already state that, and we're just routinely suspending our rules and leaving people who are

700
01:16:45,805 --> 01:16:52,590
[SPEAKER_15]: attempting to come in and open businesses in Medford to sit through very long City Council meetings.

701
01:16:52,670 --> 01:17:11,064
[SPEAKER_15]: But the purpose of this resolution is to remind not only the City Council, but also everybody in Medford, everybody in the region that are

702
01:17:14,298 --> 01:17:34,131
[SPEAKER_15]: here is to make sure that we're creating an environment where businesses feel that Medford is a place that is friendly and open and is a place where you can easily and freely come get approved for

703
01:17:36,872 --> 01:17:52,801
[SPEAKER_15]: a storefront to open your business, extend your hours if you would like to, if it's rational and logical, you can have a place that's open for business that makes our community more vibrant, that

704
01:17:54,102 --> 01:17:54,182
that.

705
01:17:54,202 --> 01:18:01,947
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, makes money for you and your family and your community and brings in tax revenue for our city, which then we can use for services for our residents.

706
01:18:02,487 --> 01:18:06,789
[SPEAKER_15]: This is what makes a city operational and what makes it work.

707
01:18:07,370 --> 01:18:11,232
[SPEAKER_15]: So, um That's what we're here to do.

708
01:18:11,552 --> 01:18:12,653
[SPEAKER_15]: And, um.

709
01:18:19,930 --> 01:18:22,072
[SPEAKER_15]: rational way to do business.

710
01:18:22,452 --> 01:18:26,415
[SPEAKER_15]: These are business meetings where people have come and set aside time in their life.

711
01:18:26,475 --> 01:18:27,656
[SPEAKER_15]: It's already the evening.

712
01:18:27,716 --> 01:18:31,879
[SPEAKER_15]: It's already starting in the evening, and it's important for us to keep that in mind.

713
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:36,523
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's why I wanted to bring this forward, and I appreciate the time.

714
01:18:37,024 --> 01:18:37,324
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

715
01:18:38,925 --> 01:18:40,326
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Lemming.

716
01:18:41,647 --> 01:18:42,027
[SPEAKER_06]: One second.

717
01:18:42,228 --> 01:18:42,508
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

718
01:18:42,951 --> 01:18:57,506
[SPEAKER_08]: So to clarify the rule change, it was on the January 14th agenda, which I'm looking at now, the refer to committee for further discussion was put before the hearings section.

719
01:18:57,586 --> 01:19:03,212
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm not sure if that is necessarily supposed to be that way.

720
01:19:03,272 --> 01:19:04,133
[SPEAKER_08]: But the point is that

721
01:19:06,810 --> 01:19:10,512
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this body needs to start being honest with itself.

722
01:19:10,552 --> 01:19:11,413
[SPEAKER_08]: We do talk a lot.

723
01:19:12,593 --> 01:19:14,515
[SPEAKER_08]: And once we get going, it's kind of hard to stop.

724
01:19:15,655 --> 01:19:25,441
[SPEAKER_08]: And once you start with the refer to committee for further discussion, which I'm sure I did two weeks ago, then that's like really when that meeting goes.

725
01:19:26,081 --> 01:19:32,685
[SPEAKER_08]: So the point of the rule was to make it so that the hearings come directly after the reports of committees.

726
01:19:32,725 --> 01:19:34,386
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's just meant to be one of those automatic,

727
01:19:35,807 --> 01:19:36,587
[SPEAKER_08]: automatic things.

728
01:19:36,647 --> 01:19:39,269
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we get to the refer.

729
01:19:39,309 --> 01:19:41,250
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's a small change.

730
01:19:41,370 --> 01:19:54,237
[SPEAKER_08]: But last time, we did have the folks from the establishment just kind of waiting here until 11 when we could have cleared them really quickly.

731
01:19:54,297 --> 01:19:59,020
[SPEAKER_08]: But we kind of forgot about it and then decided to suspend the rules.

732
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:02,702
[SPEAKER_08]: And so this is just meant to, the idea behind this is that we

733
01:20:04,243 --> 01:20:08,870
[SPEAKER_08]: usually get through the beginning of the meeting pretty automatically, reports of committees and so on.

734
01:20:08,890 --> 01:20:18,966
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I just would like the hearings to come directly after that, to not become the culture that we suspend rules and start taking things out of order until the hearings are done.

735
01:20:21,607 --> 01:20:22,327
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Lemming.

736
01:20:23,608 --> 01:20:26,769
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a note, Rule 12 is the order of business.

737
01:20:27,309 --> 01:20:35,491
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the roll call, salute the flag, and then there is announcements, accolades, remembrances, reports and records, and this is intended to serve as a consent agenda analog.

738
01:20:36,371 --> 01:20:38,112
[SPEAKER_06]: Refer to committee for further discussion is in there.

739
01:20:38,672 --> 01:20:40,853
[SPEAKER_06]: because we shouldn't talk about it when it's in that section.

740
01:20:41,093 --> 01:20:46,616
[SPEAKER_06]: So if people do submit something for that section, it's about sending that to the committee for the discussion.

741
01:20:46,776 --> 01:20:51,839
[SPEAKER_06]: So if folks want to discuss it in the regular meeting, they should be clear that should go in motions, orders, and resolutions.

742
01:20:52,499 --> 01:21:04,706
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we can still refer it out, but the intent of that was to clarify when we're having a debate on something significant versus when we are trying to say, we just want to introduce a topic because we can't talk in committee.

743
01:21:05,266 --> 01:21:09,167
[SPEAKER_06]: if a paper is not first introduced in the council, but we want to reserve that discussion for committee.

744
01:21:10,147 --> 01:21:14,448
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, it is more about councilor intent and behavior than it is about the order of business.

745
01:21:16,069 --> 01:21:25,291
[SPEAKER_06]: And then following that consent agenda, we have hearings, presentations of petitions and similar papers, then motions, orders and resolutions, then communications and reports from the mayor, city officers and employees.

746
01:21:26,151 --> 01:21:35,656
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so if we, uh, you know, if we were to just follow that, um, and the intent behind the agenda and the rules, we would, we would avoid these situations.

747
01:21:35,936 --> 01:21:36,816
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli.

748
01:21:38,337 --> 01:21:39,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

749
01:21:39,397 --> 01:21:47,822
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that, uh, I know that, uh, Councilor Began, um, sent you a message and you forwarded it to me.

750
01:21:47,882 --> 01:21:48,142
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

751
01:21:48,482 --> 01:21:54,585
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, he mentioned that, uh, the town of Beverly has an option that maybe, um,

752
01:21:55,610 --> 01:21:59,672
[SPEAKER_04]: that we could maybe enhance or help streamline the process.

753
01:21:59,712 --> 01:22:06,295
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to meet with him hopefully tomorrow or Thursday to see what suggestions he might have.

754
01:22:07,176 --> 01:22:14,919
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I don't disagree that sometimes the business owners that come here for an approval

755
01:22:16,620 --> 01:22:19,861
[SPEAKER_04]: and they're there with an attorney that they're paying by the hour.

756
01:22:21,262 --> 01:22:40,648
[SPEAKER_04]: I could see that as an issue, but unfortunately with, and I think this is a question for another day of discussion and battling, but sitting in meetings, long meetings until everybody's heard at that podium, that's our job.

757
01:22:41,348 --> 01:22:44,649
[SPEAKER_04]: Whether we like it or not, we're elected, that's part of our job.

758
01:22:44,749 --> 01:22:52,511
[SPEAKER_04]: So even if you don't like to hear what people are saying, because I, too, don't like sometimes what people are saying, but you have to respect the process.

759
01:22:53,151 --> 01:22:55,792
[SPEAKER_04]: And if it's taking us to 1130, so be it.

760
01:22:56,492 --> 01:22:58,292
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's important that people understand that.

761
01:22:59,632 --> 01:23:02,293
[SPEAKER_04]: I, too, agree that this process is already in place that we have.

762
01:23:02,953 --> 01:23:04,714
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that

763
01:23:06,566 --> 01:23:08,808
[SPEAKER_04]: having this meeting tomorrow, maybe shed some light.

764
01:23:08,848 --> 01:23:10,629
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe there's something I can bring back to the council.

765
01:23:11,229 --> 01:23:13,031
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll email you with some suggestions.

766
01:23:13,051 --> 01:23:18,594
[SPEAKER_04]: If we see anything that's fruitful, that would maybe streamline our process that they do in other communities.

767
01:23:19,915 --> 01:23:21,196
[SPEAKER_04]: We'd love to see that if we can help.

768
01:23:21,236 --> 01:23:22,837
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you, Mr. President.

769
01:23:23,058 --> 01:23:23,418
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

770
01:23:23,438 --> 01:23:23,598
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

771
01:23:23,618 --> 01:23:29,162
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think, you know, the intent here is I'm interpreting it and I'll let everybody who wants to speak interpret it as well as.

772
01:23:30,059 --> 01:23:34,601
[SPEAKER_06]: let's get the things we know we're all gonna agree on out of the way before we start talking about the things we're not gonna agree on.

773
01:23:36,021 --> 01:23:40,103
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was the intent of forming the consent agenda in the first place in 2022.

774
01:23:41,063 --> 01:23:46,646
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't call it that, but it's that first section announcements, accolades, remembrances, reports, and records.

775
01:23:47,126 --> 01:23:49,707
[SPEAKER_06]: Those would be mixed in with motions, orders, and resolutions.

776
01:23:49,747 --> 01:23:53,188
[SPEAKER_06]: You'd have reports and records at the end of the meeting rather than at the beginning of the meeting.

777
01:23:53,208 --> 01:23:54,749
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have these things that were non,

778
01:23:55,349 --> 01:23:59,390
[SPEAKER_06]: essentially non-controversial that were pro forma, just actions that the council needs to take.

779
01:23:59,410 --> 01:24:07,473
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we added to that in January of last year, this refer to committee for further discussion, because we had some questions about, are we taking a final action on something?

780
01:24:07,493 --> 01:24:11,875
[SPEAKER_06]: And no, the answer is we're just trying to start the process, the legislative process.

781
01:24:11,915 --> 01:24:17,537
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think I'm interested to hear what you have, Councilor Scarpelli, as the Subcommittee on Licensing, Permitting, and Signs Chair.

782
01:24:19,318 --> 01:24:31,718
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know that in Somerville and some other communities they will have, and I think we're moving in this direction on some things where they do a lot of work in the committee, and then it comes to the regular meeting and it is just kind of signed off on by the larger group and.

783
01:24:33,017 --> 01:24:35,519
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the petitioner doesn't have to be here necessarily.

784
01:24:35,539 --> 01:24:39,923
[SPEAKER_06]: They've been heard, questions have been asked by that subcommittee or committee.

785
01:24:41,444 --> 01:24:57,438
[SPEAKER_06]: And we also could potentially look at, I think, a revision to the order of business to look at moving petitions that have come out of that subcommittee to the more consent agenda could be something that we look at too, even though they are pretty early on.

786
01:24:58,098 --> 01:25:06,742
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate the intent of my fellow Councillors and Councillor Scarpelli on this matter and Councillor Lemming and Lazaro and I will go to Councillor Lemming.

787
01:25:06,762 --> 01:25:15,985
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, in that case, it does sound like multiple Councillors have kind of different thoughts on how to address this.

788
01:25:16,025 --> 01:25:27,470
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would motion to, I'm not sure whether to table it or to send this to committee so that it could be worked on a bit further pending Councillor Scarpelli's discussions.

789
01:25:28,339 --> 01:25:30,101
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds like we might have a rule amendment.

790
01:25:30,221 --> 01:25:31,642
[SPEAKER_06]: So that would be the governance committee.

791
01:25:32,603 --> 01:25:36,266
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, well, governance committee is pretty busy, but we'll find a time.

792
01:25:37,187 --> 01:25:40,369
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll go to Councilor Callahan, and then Councilor Lazaro.

793
01:25:42,353 --> 01:25:43,013
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

794
01:25:43,473 --> 01:25:50,977
[SPEAKER_19]: In addition to amending this, I assume it's what you're suggesting that we amended to send it to a governance committee.

795
01:25:52,057 --> 01:26:07,404
[SPEAKER_19]: I wonder if we could also do a friendly amendment to just add in language saying we urge our fellow councilors to not place other items of discussion before these hearings from business leaders.

796
01:26:09,145 --> 01:26:09,765
[SPEAKER_19]: Business people.

797
01:26:12,042 --> 01:26:22,586
[SPEAKER_19]: because a lot of the problem it sounds like is that we just, you know, we take things out of order and then we end up accidentally pushing these things until 11 o'clock at night when really let's not do that.

798
01:26:23,546 --> 01:26:24,586
[SPEAKER_06]: I will say I am urging that.

799
01:26:28,588 --> 01:26:33,109
[SPEAKER_06]: I do personally feel that's probably more the role of the chair than the rules, but that's just my opinion.

800
01:26:33,209 --> 01:26:35,370
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Zaro and then Councilor Lemming.

801
01:26:37,183 --> 01:26:59,164
[SPEAKER_15]: I would absolutely agree with that and partly that's the intention of this resolution is to kind of remind us that we don't always have to, and we also don't always have to say yes when somebody wants to suspend the rules any number of people want to suspend the rules and we do it frequently right sometimes sometimes for good reason we need to pull something out because it's ready for a third reading that needs to happen at whatever time but

802
01:27:01,158 --> 01:27:06,783
[SPEAKER_15]: For my piece, I can say that sometimes I'm not quite sure what's happening.

803
01:27:06,843 --> 01:27:14,210
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, I'm not quite paying, I'm like, what number is, like, I may need sometimes to ask for a pause.

804
01:27:14,350 --> 01:27:16,212
[SPEAKER_15]: I may need to say, are we sure?

805
01:27:16,232 --> 01:27:22,498
[SPEAKER_15]: I might wanna vote no on this suspension of the rules for this moment, because I happen to know

806
01:27:23,454 --> 01:27:33,546
[SPEAKER_15]: That in this case, when the establishment, the business owner of the establishment was here I had been speaking with her before, because we knew somebody in common we were talking.

807
01:27:34,387 --> 01:27:42,736
[SPEAKER_15]: I knew that she was here and then I happened to notice that she was still here and I was like she is still here she was there until 11pm with her lawyer waiting all night.

808
01:27:43,967 --> 01:27:56,818
[SPEAKER_15]: If I had been paying closer attention, if I had been on top of things the way I should have been, I would have said, you know what, actually I vote no on suspending the rules and let's take that first.

809
01:27:57,959 --> 01:28:09,449
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that the larger implication here and the thing that I really wanna make sure I'm stating clearly is that when you put out a message to

810
01:28:10,833 --> 01:28:31,631
[SPEAKER_15]: When you give the impression to a group of people in the business community that when you need a liquor license, it might take you five hours of sitting in a room, where if you do it in another town, it won't happen that way, then it doesn't, it has nothing to do with being a city counselor who has to stay here for five hours.

811
01:28:31,711 --> 01:28:32,772
[SPEAKER_15]: That's not the issue.

812
01:28:32,832 --> 01:28:34,174
[SPEAKER_15]: We will be here regardless.

813
01:28:35,174 --> 01:28:43,779
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a matter of making sure that people who are business owners who want to do business in our city, which we want to encourage, do not feel that it's an imposition for them to do that.

814
01:28:43,959 --> 01:28:45,720
[SPEAKER_15]: We want to encourage them to be able to do that.

815
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:47,361
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's my intention.

816
01:28:48,441 --> 01:29:01,088
[SPEAKER_15]: I do think that it's possible that this paper will not turn out to be appropriate because of the way that it's written and the way that the rules are, but I'm comfortable with it going to governance and us talking it over there and maybe making amendments in committee.

817
01:29:02,681 --> 01:29:05,703
[SPEAKER_15]: but I appreciate you all entertaining it and discussing it here.

818
01:29:06,623 --> 01:29:08,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Zaro, Councilor Lemming.

819
01:29:10,025 --> 01:29:12,927
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, and just to just be clear.

820
01:29:12,967 --> 01:29:17,410
[SPEAKER_08]: So I do understand the intention behind the referred to committee for further discussion.

821
01:29:17,470 --> 01:29:27,097
[SPEAKER_08]: I've just found that when counselors get to talking about their own resolutions, they do kind of tend to go off.

822
01:29:27,197 --> 01:29:27,357
[SPEAKER_08]: So

823
01:29:28,165 --> 01:29:30,727
[SPEAKER_08]: uh, you know, talk a little bit more than maybe is intended.

824
01:29:30,767 --> 01:29:35,090
[SPEAKER_08]: And so the intention is just to get the hearings out of the way before that process starts.

825
01:29:35,150 --> 01:29:41,394
[SPEAKER_08]: But if, uh, but either way, I would motion to refer this to governance.

826
01:29:42,595 --> 01:29:46,138
[SPEAKER_06]: The motion to refer this paper to the governance committee, seconded by Councillor Callahan.

827
01:29:46,158 --> 01:29:47,218
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll go to public participation.

828
01:29:47,238 --> 01:29:49,860
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll start at the podium, name and address for the record.

829
01:29:49,880 --> 01:29:50,661
[SPEAKER_06]: And you have three minutes.

830
01:29:55,866 --> 01:29:58,328
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

831
01:29:58,969 --> 01:30:12,320
[SPEAKER_05]: I just would like to say that I very strongly support this resolution or any other way to streamline bureaucracy of the city council and in general to make the life of business people, overall residents, as easy as possible.

832
01:30:13,681 --> 01:30:21,287
[SPEAKER_05]: I will have to say that I was very pleasantly surprised to find a pro-business resolution in the agenda, come up by surprise.

833
01:30:21,588 --> 01:30:24,290
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I thought, and I remember that this is an election year.

834
01:30:25,943 --> 01:30:31,467
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would like to remind everyone that the private business sector is the very engine of economic prosperity.

835
01:30:32,107 --> 01:30:33,969
[SPEAKER_05]: Business people are social benefactors.

836
01:30:34,729 --> 01:30:40,734
[SPEAKER_05]: In order to succeed, business people must offer a better product at a better price, thereby contributing to general well-being.

837
01:30:41,054 --> 01:30:42,996
[SPEAKER_05]: If they don't, they simply go bankrupt.

838
01:30:46,332 --> 01:30:53,635
[SPEAKER_05]: This city council, most members of the city council supported a policy last year that is bad for business.

839
01:30:54,035 --> 01:30:56,515
[SPEAKER_05]: And that policy is increasing commercial taxes.

840
01:30:57,676 --> 01:31:00,596
[SPEAKER_05]: Increasing business taxes is indeed bad for business.

841
01:31:01,217 --> 01:31:05,958
[SPEAKER_05]: When you increase taxes on businesses, you're essentially taking more of the resources out of their hands.

842
01:31:06,618 --> 01:31:13,260
[SPEAKER_05]: This leaves them with less capital to invest in growth, innovation, and maybe most important for our community, job creation.

843
01:31:14,777 --> 01:31:16,878
[SPEAKER_05]: Moreover, businesses don't really pay taxes.

844
01:31:17,459 --> 01:31:18,700
[SPEAKER_05]: They just pass them on.

845
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:27,406
[SPEAKER_05]: They pass them on to consumers through higher prices, to employees through lower wages, or to shareholders through smaller dividends.

846
01:31:27,966 --> 01:31:33,450
[SPEAKER_05]: The burden is distributed based on businesses' capacity to flourish that suffers the immediate strain.

847
01:31:34,631 --> 01:31:37,393
[SPEAKER_05]: It's also key to consider the broader economic environment.

848
01:31:38,093 --> 01:31:42,216
[SPEAKER_05]: Higher business taxes can deter new investments, discourage risk-taking,

849
01:31:42,967 --> 01:31:45,128
[SPEAKER_05]: and ultimately lead to slower economic growth.

850
01:31:45,808 --> 01:31:50,609
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a kind of intervention that can disrupt the free market's natural ability to allocate resources efficiently.

851
01:31:53,029 --> 01:32:03,952
[SPEAKER_05]: I think all of us in Medford should place the least possible burden on businesses, encouraging them to thrive and contribute to economic growth, which in turn can expand the tax base naturally.

852
01:32:04,727 --> 01:32:14,597
[SPEAKER_05]: And I finally would like to conclude with a quote from Thomas Sowell, economist Thomas Sowell, that says, quote, in politics, the goal is not truth, but votes.

853
01:32:14,978 --> 01:32:16,019
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

854
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:17,981
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for your comment.

855
01:32:18,001 --> 01:32:20,123
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll go to Zoom, back to Paige Lieberman.

856
01:32:20,143 --> 01:32:21,845
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address for the record.

857
01:32:21,885 --> 01:32:22,666
[SPEAKER_06]: You have three minutes.

858
01:32:24,977 --> 01:32:27,221
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's Matthew Paisley on 15 Canal Street.

859
01:32:27,261 --> 01:32:29,304
[SPEAKER_03]: I really appreciate that this has been brought forward.

860
01:32:29,324 --> 01:32:32,088
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little bit tangential.

861
01:32:32,709 --> 01:32:38,178
[SPEAKER_03]: For people who do not know, tomorrow is the hearing for the Small Business Administrator.

862
01:32:39,343 --> 01:32:45,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Our ranking, the ranking member of that committee in the Senate is our Senator Ed Markey.

863
01:32:45,225 --> 01:32:57,127
[SPEAKER_03]: I reached out to him to advocate for tomorrow because, you know, the federal government is taking some pretty drastic measures on their questions about grants and loans.

864
01:32:57,427 --> 01:33:02,749
[SPEAKER_03]: I was able to discover, at least today, that a particular loan that SBA provides, 7A, will be maintained.

865
01:33:02,769 --> 01:33:03,849
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good news.

866
01:33:08,450 --> 01:33:20,879
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as the meeting lengths, there was talk about this at the governance meeting last week, and there's this talk again.

867
01:33:21,919 --> 01:33:24,021
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes it seems like there's not much clarity.

868
01:33:24,621 --> 01:33:28,204
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that the majority of the Councillors are aware of rule.

869
01:33:28,824 --> 01:33:31,087
[SPEAKER_03]: For how long counselors can speak.

870
01:33:31,708 --> 01:33:38,636
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, there's a question of there's a will there obviously are things that can be done right now to have more efficient meetings.

871
01:33:39,357 --> 01:33:46,987
[SPEAKER_03]: I support the streamlining and through the years I've felt streamlining for businesses through the years, it seemed kind of strange to me.

872
01:33:47,687 --> 01:33:56,250
[SPEAKER_03]: that run-of-the-mill small business owners need to appear before a deliberative body to get permission just to open up.

873
01:33:56,650 --> 01:34:03,873
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems like, yeah, that should be definitely streamlined unless you're proposing doing something extremely unethical and bizarre.

874
01:34:04,373 --> 01:34:16,097
[SPEAKER_03]: I really hope that that's successful at the streamlining, and I hope that councillors can continue to consider options beyond that, how to make opening a business as easy as possible.

875
01:34:16,117 --> 01:34:16,917
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

876
01:34:20,483 --> 01:34:21,884
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for your comment.

877
01:34:25,865 --> 01:34:31,928
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion to refer to Governance Committee by Councilor Lemming seconded by Councilor Sang.

878
01:34:32,208 --> 01:34:32,828
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

879
01:34:33,669 --> 01:34:33,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Opposed?

880
01:34:33,969 --> 01:34:34,629
[SPEAKER_06]: The motion passes.

881
01:34:38,102 --> 01:34:52,552
[SPEAKER_06]: 25-016 offered by President Behrs, be it resolved by the Menford City Council that the City Council President, City Council Vice President, and City Clerk conduct a process to recruit a new City Messenger and make a recommendation of a candidate for City Messenger for a final vote by the City Council.

882
01:34:53,533 --> 01:34:55,855
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this is a relatively self-explanatory resolution.

883
01:34:55,975 --> 01:34:57,656
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy to answer any questions if anyone has any.

884
01:35:01,158 --> 01:35:04,221
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion approved by Councilor Sang, I will go to Councilor Callahan.

885
01:35:05,401 --> 01:35:06,082
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

886
01:35:08,797 --> 01:35:16,683
[SPEAKER_19]: I absolutely so appreciated our former messenger, Lera Lepore, who's a wonderful person.

887
01:35:17,904 --> 01:35:23,167
[SPEAKER_19]: I do hope that we can update the messenger role a little bit given

888
01:35:24,620 --> 01:35:31,487
[SPEAKER_19]: know, the digital age and that we may not need the exact services that were in his job description before.

889
01:35:31,507 --> 01:35:49,384
[SPEAKER_19]: I will say that if the city is going to hire a staff person for the city council, if the city council has a staff person, I would hope that some of their time might be dedicated to constituent services, which I think in, you know, most cities that is one of the first staff that is hired for a city council.

890
01:35:50,485 --> 01:35:57,090
[SPEAKER_19]: in, you know, there are certain cities, Cambridge and other cities, where every city councilor has a staff person who basically does constituent services.

891
01:35:57,591 --> 01:36:12,544
[SPEAKER_19]: I think constituent services are incredibly important to the number of emails that we receive with people who have questions, you know, that really are questions for the administration of us, you know, sending them to the right administrative person in the, you know, in City Hall.

892
01:36:13,505 --> 01:36:15,226
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm hoping that either

893
01:36:17,408 --> 01:36:27,755
[SPEAKER_19]: the messenger position can be one that can do a little bit of that kind of work and less driving around to deliver us.

894
01:36:28,415 --> 01:36:41,444
[SPEAKER_19]: As much as I enjoyed having the paper copies of the agendas delivered to my door, I hope that maybe some of that time can be used for constituent services and that we can just kind of look at that role and update it for the 21st century.

895
01:36:41,604 --> 01:36:41,824
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

896
01:36:42,434 --> 01:36:43,035
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

897
01:36:43,055 --> 01:36:50,202
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is our first appointment of a city messenger in at least for four decades, I would say close to maybe three.

898
01:36:52,789 --> 01:36:57,552
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I think our dear friend Larry served as a city messenger for 37 years, 37 years.

899
01:36:57,612 --> 01:36:58,412
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, yeah.

900
01:36:59,573 --> 01:37:06,237
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, if folks haven't seen it, uh, there is a little Larry, um, memorial in the clerk's office.

901
01:37:06,517 --> 01:37:10,379
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I got Larry's corner going Larry's corner, um, over by the bulletin board.

902
01:37:10,399 --> 01:37:13,360
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, it was touching to see.

903
01:37:13,621 --> 01:37:20,765
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and we have had some discussions about some of the topics that you've talked about and what the role of messenger can look like.

904
01:37:21,145 --> 01:37:21,265
[SPEAKER_06]: Um,

905
01:37:21,918 --> 01:37:22,598
[SPEAKER_06]: going forward.

906
01:37:22,758 --> 01:37:28,441
[SPEAKER_06]: So we will through the clerk, the vice president, I will keep the council updated on on how we move through that process.

907
01:37:28,501 --> 01:37:30,122
[SPEAKER_06]: If that is sufficient.

908
01:37:31,123 --> 01:37:31,463
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

909
01:37:33,044 --> 01:37:38,887
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of Councilor saying seconded by Councilors are to approve all those in favor.

910
01:37:39,527 --> 01:37:43,089
[SPEAKER_06]: Opposed motion passes.

911
01:37:43,109 --> 01:37:46,010
[SPEAKER_06]: 2 5017 review of a meeting law complaint of a meeting law complaint.

912
01:37:46,070 --> 01:37:50,052
[SPEAKER_06]: Acknowledged receipt of open meeting law complaint from Laura Ortiz against the City Council.

913
01:37:50,632 --> 01:37:51,213
[SPEAKER_06]: Did it January 11th

914
01:37:52,889 --> 01:37:55,110
[SPEAKER_06]: 2025 acknowledge and review complaint and discuss response.

915
01:37:56,091 --> 01:37:56,911
[SPEAKER_06]: Votes may be taken.

916
01:37:56,931 --> 01:37:59,492
[SPEAKER_06]: We do have the open meeting law complaint form here.

917
01:37:59,552 --> 01:38:18,761
[SPEAKER_06]: This is from Laura Ortiz of Lowell, Massachusetts, who has made an open meeting law complaint that is in very, very small text, and I will not be reading the whole thing, but it is essentially an argument that the council has violated the open meeting law by independently councilor signing onto a letter.

918
01:38:20,182 --> 01:38:20,622
[SPEAKER_06]: There is

919
01:38:22,398 --> 01:38:26,839
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been working with council and there is a response drafted.

920
01:38:29,220 --> 01:38:32,421
[SPEAKER_06]: This is to the Open Meeting Division at the Office of the Attorney General.

921
01:38:32,441 --> 01:38:41,104
[SPEAKER_06]: It says, just because it's long, I will sit down to make sure I can read the whole thing on my computer.

922
01:38:43,783 --> 01:38:47,744
[SPEAKER_06]: This firm represents the this is from Janelle Austin KP law.

923
01:38:48,604 --> 01:38:58,647
[SPEAKER_06]: It says this firm represents the city of Medford the city council, and the receipt of an open law complaint filed by Miss Laura Ortiz dated January 11 2025 which was received by the council that same day.

924
01:38:58,667 --> 01:39:05,149
[SPEAKER_06]: The complaint alleges that the council violated open meeting while when five members of the council individually signed a digitally circulated letter.

925
01:39:05,849 --> 01:39:07,831
[SPEAKER_06]: concerning recent changes to Massachusetts law.

926
01:39:09,774 --> 01:39:11,415
[SPEAKER_06]: This is essentially the summary on January 20, 2025.

927
01:39:11,936 --> 01:39:17,802
[SPEAKER_06]: That's this meeting, the city council met at a properly posted meeting and open session, which we're doing right now to discuss the complaint.

928
01:39:18,643 --> 01:39:26,331
[SPEAKER_06]: The council has carefully reviewed the allegations contained in the complaint following such discussion has authorized this response on its behalf in accordance with general law chapter 30 a section 23.

929
01:39:28,500 --> 01:39:37,269
[SPEAKER_06]: and 940 of the Massachusetts regulations subsection 29.05 subsection five, which is based on the information provided.

930
01:39:38,350 --> 01:39:42,794
[SPEAKER_06]: The complaint alleges that a quorum deliberated outside of a properly posted meeting as set forth.

931
01:39:42,854 --> 01:39:46,398
[SPEAKER_06]: However, the council respectfully submits that no openly meeting law violation has occurred.

932
01:39:47,047 --> 01:39:53,230
[SPEAKER_06]: specifically while five individual members of the council did voluntarily and separately sign on to the letter in question individually.

933
01:39:53,830 --> 01:39:57,612
[SPEAKER_06]: No deliberation occurred among or between the councillors whatsoever regarding this matter.

934
01:39:58,292 --> 01:40:08,357
[SPEAKER_06]: Specifically, the five individual members of the council who signed on to the letter did so as individuals completely independently from one another in response to a mass circulated correspondence among public officials across the Commonwealth.

935
01:40:08,877 --> 01:40:15,180
[SPEAKER_06]: There was no discussion, coordination, or communications regarding signing this letter between or among a quorum of the council at any time.

936
01:40:15,780 --> 01:40:19,681
[SPEAKER_06]: As a result, the council respectfully submits that no open meeting law violation occurred.

937
01:40:22,823 --> 01:40:23,723
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

938
01:40:23,763 --> 01:40:29,945
[SPEAKER_06]: There's more in the letter, but it's just a recitation of further facts and documentation outlining that summary.

939
01:40:29,965 --> 01:40:33,747
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there any discussion by members of the council on this matter?

940
01:40:38,320 --> 01:40:39,201
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Collins.

941
01:40:40,821 --> 01:40:50,867
[SPEAKER_18]: I just want to thank the Council President for his collaboration with City's legal support to make sure that we respond to this in the way that we're statutorily obligated to do.

942
01:40:50,887 --> 01:40:58,732
[SPEAKER_18]: Now that this response is being formulated and will be sent in accordance with the rules and regulations, what would an appropriate vote at this meeting be?

943
01:40:58,752 --> 01:41:04,615
[SPEAKER_18]: Would it be to receive and place on file, to authorize the Council President to continue promulgating a response?

944
01:41:05,258 --> 01:41:10,841
[SPEAKER_06]: The vote would be to acknowledge and review the complaint and accept the response as drafted by Council.

945
01:41:11,201 --> 01:41:15,324
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, I would make a motion to accept the response as drafted by Council.

946
01:41:17,385 --> 01:41:20,787
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Lemming, is there any further discussion?

947
01:41:23,889 --> 01:41:27,311
[SPEAKER_06]: Seeing none, is there anyone in the chamber on Zoom who would like to speak to the matter?

948
01:41:27,331 --> 01:41:29,672
[SPEAKER_18]: Council President.

949
01:41:30,180 --> 01:41:30,860
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Collins.

950
01:41:31,081 --> 01:41:31,341
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

951
01:41:31,381 --> 01:41:34,223
[SPEAKER_18]: I probably should have, just for the purpose of clarity, prefaced my comments.

952
01:41:34,963 --> 01:41:38,986
[SPEAKER_18]: In addition to our next steps, I also just want to purpose this discussion.

953
01:41:39,006 --> 01:41:43,809
[SPEAKER_18]: I think this complaint is flagrantly frivolous.

954
01:41:43,889 --> 01:41:46,791
[SPEAKER_18]: It's something that we have to attend to, we have to respond to in these ways.

955
01:41:46,811 --> 01:41:47,691
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm glad that we're doing that.

956
01:41:48,452 --> 01:41:49,012
[SPEAKER_18]: And I

957
01:41:51,014 --> 01:42:05,744
[SPEAKER_18]: I find it curious that a non-resident of the city is taking it upon themselves to waste elected officials' times because of time spent lobbying for state-level policy that would make sure that fewer people have to sleep on the street in the winter.

958
01:42:06,325 --> 01:42:06,605
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

959
01:42:07,025 --> 01:42:09,307
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Collins, and I would note that

960
01:42:10,298 --> 01:42:16,982
[SPEAKER_06]: We did receive communication that the person who filed this as a serial filer of complaints against officials across the Commonwealth.

961
01:42:17,323 --> 01:42:26,188
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's just does this all the time and most very often they're frivolous and the determination is that no violation was held.

962
01:42:26,769 --> 01:42:27,269
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Sang.

963
01:42:28,552 --> 01:42:38,601
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to note that that's evidenced by the fact that there's not a lot of research done into the whole process and into the facts of the case.

964
01:42:39,402 --> 01:42:47,669
[SPEAKER_07]: Many of the facts here that are asserted about things I did or did not do or were thinking are not true and never happened.

965
01:42:49,171 --> 01:42:51,393
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just impressed that you can read the text that small.

966
01:42:52,063 --> 01:42:55,064
[SPEAKER_07]: It's because I'm younger than you guys.

967
01:42:55,084 --> 01:42:55,244
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

968
01:42:55,264 --> 01:42:56,105
[SPEAKER_06]: That was my joke.

969
01:42:56,565 --> 01:42:57,485
[SPEAKER_06]: I was making that joke.

970
01:42:58,385 --> 01:42:59,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Please let me make my jokes.

971
01:43:03,347 --> 01:43:05,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Sang and I appreciate that.

972
01:43:06,689 --> 01:43:16,032
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of Vice President Collins is seconded by Councilor Lemming to acknowledge the complaint and to adopt the response as drafted by council.

973
01:43:17,613 --> 01:43:18,453
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

974

[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, having affirmative, none negative, the motion passes.

976
01:43:39,218 --> 01:43:41,980
[SPEAKER_06]: 25014, we have the Community Preservation Committee appropriation requests.

977
01:43:42,040 --> 01:43:45,162
[SPEAKER_06]: We did hear these and we heard from all the applicants last week.

978
01:43:46,461 --> 01:43:47,742
[SPEAKER_06]: This is from the mayor.

979
01:43:48,823 --> 01:44:11,459
[SPEAKER_06]: Dear President bears members of the council on behalf of the Community Preservation Committee, I respectfully request and recommend your honorable body approve the following recommendations of the Community Preservation Committee requesting the appropriation of 526,000 to the Department of Public Works parks division for the place that tennis court resurfacing requesting the appropriation of $322,500 to for the facilities department for the city council chamber windows restoration project.

[SPEAKER_06]: request the appropriation of $250,000 to the Affordable Housing Trust as initial funding to conduct affordable housing tasks and requesting the appropriation of $98,285 from the CPA Open Space Reserve to the Recreation Department to complete the Condon Shell Field Lighting Project.

985
01:44:57,471 --> 01:45:01,392
[SPEAKER_06]: As we know, public presentations were held Tuesday, January 21st to the Committee of the Whole meeting.

986
01:45:02,399 --> 01:45:10,383
[SPEAKER_06]: The project will be tracked in the Community Preservation Fund, the recommendation letters are attached and incorporated, and we have manager DuPont and chairperson Cameron in attendance as needed.

987
01:45:10,443 --> 01:45:12,343
[SPEAKER_06]: Respectfully submitted, Brianna Lugo-Kern, Mayor.

988
01:45:13,024 --> 01:45:16,885
[SPEAKER_06]: I will go to Vice President Collins, Council Lizard, Councilor Sang.

989
01:45:17,206 --> 01:45:17,906
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Collins.

990
01:45:18,948 --> 01:45:26,396
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, President bears, we had a really helpful informative committee of the whole about this a couple weeks ago, or maybe it was just last week.

991
01:45:27,597 --> 01:45:29,539
[SPEAKER_18]: couple weeks ago, just last week.

992
01:45:31,201 --> 01:45:38,108
[SPEAKER_18]: went through all of the projects in detail the funding recommendations, the specifics on the programs will be funded it's always great to see.

993
01:45:38,428 --> 01:45:44,030
[SPEAKER_18]: you know, an unanimous vote by the committee, which I think is almost always the case.

994
01:45:44,670 --> 01:45:51,213
[SPEAKER_18]: I know that there's so much thought and research put into vetting the many programs that compete for this funding, and they all do such incredible work in our community.

995
01:45:51,233 --> 01:46:01,757
[SPEAKER_18]: And I appreciate Manager DuPont and Chair Cameron for making sure that we got a really thorough walk through all of the details at the meeting last week to prepare us for this vote.

996
01:46:02,617 --> 01:46:04,298
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm happy to make a motion for approval.

997
01:46:04,398 --> 01:46:04,618
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

998
01:46:10,144 --> 01:46:10,524
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

999
01:46:11,084 --> 01:46:30,069
[SPEAKER_15]: At the committee of the whole I had expressed a slight concern that being a member of the Unitarian Universalist Church of Medford that it would be a conflict of interest potentially to vote for an appropriation for the facade but I researched it and having not

1000
01:46:31,283 --> 01:46:37,212
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't stand to gain anything financially from appropriating these funds myself personally.

1001
01:46:37,232 --> 01:46:41,218
[SPEAKER_15]: And Councilor Lemming is also a member of that church.

1002
01:46:42,228 --> 01:46:47,011
[SPEAKER_15]: Neither of us stand to gain anything because we obviously we don't, we're just members of the church.

1003
01:46:47,051 --> 01:46:51,053
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't stand to gain anything financially from approving this appropriation.

1004
01:46:52,974 --> 01:46:58,116
[SPEAKER_15]: So I believe it is ethically appropriate for us to vote for this.

1005
01:46:58,136 --> 01:47:02,499
[SPEAKER_15]: So we don't need to sever that portion from the whole.

1006
01:47:02,759 --> 01:47:03,019
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1007
01:47:05,638 --> 01:47:18,285
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to briefly thank the members of the CPC, Manager DuPont and Chair Cameron for their hard work putting together these projects and putting together these meetings.

1008
01:47:18,505 --> 01:47:21,507
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it's a lot of work, working through a lot of material.

1009
01:47:21,947 --> 01:47:35,275
[SPEAKER_07]: These projects are ones I'm particularly excited about because I believe that they move our city towards a lot of our goals of livability, better parks, moving towards more childcare, moving towards

1010
01:47:35,615 --> 01:47:38,598
[SPEAKER_07]: better public facilities moving towards more affordable housing.

1011
01:47:38,938 --> 01:47:44,443
[SPEAKER_07]: I think these are goals that everyone behind this rail and most, if not all, residents share.

1012
01:47:46,905 --> 01:47:47,825
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Sang.

1013
01:47:47,885 --> 01:47:55,412
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of Councilor Zaro to approve, seconded by, did you move?

1014
01:47:56,012 --> 01:47:56,553
[SPEAKER_06]: You made a motion?

1015
01:47:56,973 --> 01:47:57,373
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

1016
01:47:58,695 --> 01:48:01,337
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Collins to approve, seconded by Councilor Zaro.

1017
01:48:01,877 --> 01:48:02,678
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1018
01:48:06,548 --> 01:48:16,451
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Callahan, Vice President Collins, Councilor Lozaro, Councilor Lemming, Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Sang, President Behrs.

1019
01:48:16,971 --> 01:48:19,192
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, having affirmative and negative, the motion passes.

1020
01:48:19,212 --> 01:48:25,674
[SPEAKER_06]: 25018 offered by Mayor Buenaventura Kern, Capital Stabilization Fund rescission and appropriation request.

1021
01:48:26,655 --> 01:48:29,996
[SPEAKER_06]: Dear President Behrs, oh, Gaston, were you wanting to talk on CPC?

1022
01:48:30,056 --> 01:48:30,736
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm so sorry.

1023
01:48:30,756 --> 01:48:36,318
[SPEAKER_06]: I can come back to you right now if folks are okay with that.

1024
01:48:36,842 --> 01:48:39,185
[SPEAKER_06]: Was it about the chambers?

1025
01:48:40,446 --> 01:48:40,967
[SPEAKER_06]: The tennis courts.

1026
01:48:41,227 --> 01:48:41,668
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll take you.

1027
01:48:41,728 --> 01:48:42,749
[SPEAKER_06]: I really apologize.

1028
01:48:43,210 --> 01:48:43,710
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

1029
01:48:45,372 --> 01:48:47,996
[SPEAKER_06]: Gaston, name and address for the record.

1030
01:48:48,096 --> 01:48:49,497
[SPEAKER_05]: I just got a question.

1031
01:48:49,517 --> 01:48:55,305
[SPEAKER_05]: So I missed the Committee of the Whole meeting, but I was just taking a quick look at the

1032
01:48:56,398 --> 01:48:57,779
[SPEAKER_05]: agenda for that committee of the whole.

1033
01:48:58,139 --> 01:49:06,323
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I'm just slightly concerned that it's over half a million dollars for the tennis courts and I was just wondering whether, you know,

1034
01:49:08,731 --> 01:49:10,172
[SPEAKER_05]: Has there been any research?

1035
01:49:10,272 --> 01:49:18,535
[SPEAKER_05]: I just saw the cracks in the picture, you know, to maybe resurface it in some other way, like maybe using brick powder or something like that, one.

1036
01:49:18,575 --> 01:49:24,618
[SPEAKER_05]: And then two, is there also, can this be also, can we charge a fee to sort of like help?

1037
01:49:24,978 --> 01:49:26,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, I mean,

1038
01:49:26,999 --> 01:49:28,882
[SPEAKER_05]: over $500,000 for this.

1039
01:49:29,042 --> 01:49:30,003
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand the regulation.

1040
01:49:30,023 --> 01:49:31,085
[SPEAKER_05]: I support all of that.

1041
01:49:31,645 --> 01:49:38,855
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the same time, you know, I mean, we have scarce resources, and we got to, you know, if it's not lieutenant courts, this money could go somewhere else.

1042
01:49:38,875 --> 01:49:40,417
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was just wondering whether

1043
01:49:41,722 --> 01:49:46,045
[SPEAKER_05]: other sources of revenue were evaluated for this project?

1044
01:49:46,265 --> 01:49:57,573
[SPEAKER_05]: And if not, or yes, and this is the best thing to do, where there's some action plan to prevent these cracks from developing, maybe changing the surface material or something like that, that makes it more resilient.

1045
01:49:57,833 --> 01:49:59,574
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll be brief and then I'll go to Councillor Callaghan.

1046
01:49:59,834 --> 01:50:02,236
[SPEAKER_06]: We did have Commissioner McGivern discuss this and

1047
01:50:04,821 --> 01:50:11,589
[SPEAKER_06]: In terms of just repairing the cracks, that was not recommended because it would impact the ability of the service to perform the function that it's functioning.

1048
01:50:11,629 --> 01:50:16,354
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, even if you seal the cracks, it might affect how the tennis ball bounces, essentially.

1049
01:50:16,374 --> 01:50:25,205
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, he indicated that the cracks are an indication that the underlying base foundation is in question, and that's why they believe they need to replace it.

1050
01:50:25,765 --> 01:50:33,349
[SPEAKER_06]: essentially re certain not just put new stuff over but also fix the the base under the surface.

1051
01:50:34,430 --> 01:50:37,792
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'll go to Councilor Callahan if you have a more distinct memory than I do.

1052
01:50:38,710 --> 01:50:39,010
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1053
01:50:39,451 --> 01:50:42,693
[SPEAKER_19]: First, I want to thank you for all of the meetings that you attend.

1054
01:50:42,733 --> 01:50:45,495
[SPEAKER_19]: You're one of our most engaged residents here in Bedford.

1055
01:50:45,956 --> 01:50:50,800
[SPEAKER_19]: And the fact that you happen not to be at that meeting is completely understandable.

1056
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:57,865
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm glad that you're here asking this question, because most residents don't, in fact, go and look back at the committee meetings.

1057
01:50:57,905 --> 01:51:00,667
[SPEAKER_19]: But they may, in fact, come and look at this meeting.

1058
01:51:02,069 --> 01:51:03,950
[SPEAKER_19]: And you asked some questions that I asked.

1059
01:51:04,050 --> 01:51:05,892
[SPEAKER_19]: So I specifically asked Commissioner McIvern.

1060
01:51:05,932 --> 01:51:06,812
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sorry, I can go on.

1061
01:51:06,832 --> 01:51:07,513
[SPEAKER_19]: No, no, not at all.

1062
01:51:08,033 --> 01:51:12,655
[SPEAKER_19]: Again, I think it's important that we do discuss these things here at the official regular City Council meetings.

1063
01:51:13,555 --> 01:51:25,439
[SPEAKER_19]: I did ask about resurfacing because I know with roads, you can save a lot of money by doing that kind of repair in between, and so I asked if maybe we would be able to save money in the future by doing these kinds of intermediary repairs.

1064
01:51:25,920 --> 01:51:31,782
[SPEAKER_19]: He said, as President Beres noted, that unfortunately, because of the nature of

1065
01:51:32,682 --> 01:51:47,792
[SPEAKER_19]: playing tennis, that it might affect the way the ball bounces that might cause people to sprain ankles, that doing those kinds of repairs doesn't actually work on the kind of surface also as noted that the underlying, you know,

1066
01:51:49,173 --> 01:51:50,914
[SPEAKER_19]: structure just needs to be repaired at this point.

1067
01:51:52,195 --> 01:52:02,183
[SPEAKER_19]: And then importantly, I think also Councilor Scarpelli noted, if I may, to let me know if I'm wrong, that the high school uses this as well.

1068
01:52:02,264 --> 01:52:09,630
[SPEAKER_19]: Like it is a very used tennis courts that really, Medford really would suffer if we did without.

1069
01:52:09,710 --> 01:52:10,891
[SPEAKER_19]: And so I appreciate your question.

1070
01:52:13,696 --> 01:52:14,157
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a rental.

1071
01:52:14,378 --> 01:52:15,660
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a rental, sorry.

1072
01:52:15,680 --> 01:52:16,623
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to pay, basically.

1073
01:52:16,823 --> 01:52:18,146
[SPEAKER_04]: They use it as a rental.

1074
01:52:20,603 --> 01:52:26,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, goes to the rec department, which then adds so we can provide programming for the youth.

1075
01:52:26,247 --> 01:52:29,249
[SPEAKER_06]: And the rec department is largely fee funded, except for the salaries.

1076
01:52:29,369 --> 01:52:31,911
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty much... It's self-sustaining.

1077
01:52:31,971 --> 01:52:36,835
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because I think in general, the fees get you with, you know, exemptions for people that can't afford it.

1078
01:52:36,875 --> 01:52:37,815
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes sense.

1079
01:52:38,135 --> 01:52:38,956
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1080
01:52:39,276 --> 01:52:45,661
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it's, just to further on that, it's kind of one of those situations where the fees do fund something in the city.

1081
01:52:46,500 --> 01:52:52,683
[SPEAKER_06]: the capital improvements and not like it's not the fee money goes to the fund to keep the thing maintained, but as the fee money goes to run the program.

1082
01:52:52,723 --> 01:53:01,027
[SPEAKER_06]: So in a sense, you know, if you were to shift the money to the other thing, we'd have to pay for something one way or the other, I think, but Councilor Lazaro.

1083
01:53:03,770 --> 01:53:08,333
[SPEAKER_15]: I was going to say that same thing that the number struck me as well.

1084
01:53:08,353 --> 01:53:24,784
[SPEAKER_15]: And I asked a similar question, but I felt that it was a valid thing to spend a lot of money on because it is something that brings revenue into the city on a consistent basis and something that you want your facilities to be good.

1085
01:53:24,844 --> 01:53:27,847
[SPEAKER_15]: So people continue to rent them and they're rented.

1086
01:53:29,127 --> 01:53:35,789
[SPEAKER_15]: for a fee by many organizations, I mean, year round, and maybe not right now.

1087
01:53:35,869 --> 01:53:43,392
[SPEAKER_15]: But that, you know, we want to maintain those facilities so that people want to keep renting them, and then we bring in the revenue for the city.

1088
01:53:43,472 --> 01:53:46,653
[SPEAKER_15]: So that felt valid, especially.

1089
01:53:47,893 --> 01:53:48,673
[SPEAKER_15]: But thank you for asking.

1090
01:53:50,134 --> 01:53:53,275
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, and my apologies for moving through the vote.

1091
01:53:53,295 --> 01:53:53,555
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.

1092
01:53:54,572 --> 01:54:12,821
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, a capital stabilization fund rescission and appropriation request from the mayor dear President bears members of the council I respect the request and recommend that your honor body rescind the capital stabilization fund appropriation, and the amount of 322,500 for the window restoration in the chambers.

1093
01:54:13,761 --> 01:54:14,702
[SPEAKER_06]: That was approved November 12.

1094
01:54:15,883 --> 01:54:22,329
[SPEAKER_06]: None of the appropriated funds have been spent yet, and a request to appropriate the CPA funds has been submitted, and we just approved it.

1095
01:54:22,950 --> 01:54:33,401
[SPEAKER_06]: And this was, I think, as we discussed last week, the CPA funds were a better use than the stabilization funds because of the restricted purposes of CPA funds versus the general purposes of the stabilization fund.

1096
01:54:35,350 --> 01:54:42,258
[SPEAKER_06]: And that Manager DuPont and Director Riggi indicated there'd be potentially a one week delay in the procurement process.

1097
01:54:42,318 --> 01:54:46,543
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not super significant in terms of the timeline.

1098
01:54:47,263 --> 01:54:50,006
[SPEAKER_06]: The second request is to appropriate $197,012.95 for facilities which include the following projects.

1099
01:54:56,113 --> 01:55:14,786
[SPEAKER_06]: window dressings in the City Hall chambers, emergency boiler repairs in City Hall, flooring replacement in the Veterans Office and Elections Office, City Hall lock changes, replacement of backflow preventers at Engine 3, Fire Engine 3, new shades and blinds, Fire Station Engine 3, bathroom renovations and adjacent repairs at Engine 4,

1100
01:55:15,686 --> 01:55:18,128
[SPEAKER_06]: window trims at Engine 4 and window trims at Engine 6.

1101
01:55:19,169 --> 01:55:21,070
[SPEAKER_06]: The total is $197,012.95.

1102
01:55:21,190 --> 01:55:32,099
[SPEAKER_06]: With the rescission, any appropriation requires two-thirds majority vote, and with the rescission and the appropriation, the balance of the capital stabilization fund would actually increase from $3,405,000 to $3,530,481.

1103
01:55:40,906 --> 01:55:43,431
[SPEAKER_06]: That is the proposal before us.

1104
01:55:44,092 --> 01:55:47,018
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will go to members of the council if they have any questions.

1105
01:55:47,058 --> 01:55:49,824
[SPEAKER_06]: We do have Director Riggi here on Zoom.

1106
01:55:50,826 --> 01:55:51,747
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Collins.

1107
01:55:53,395 --> 01:55:54,775
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, President Behrs.

1108
01:55:55,596 --> 01:56:20,302
[SPEAKER_18]: Again, last week, we got a quick briefing on why it made sense for these funding sources to be shuffled around, essentially that for a historic restoration project, which is kind of like the more limited that we should use funds that are very, very limited to historic preservation on historic preservation projects, rather than having that dip into the CPC fund, which could be used for other uses that we

1109
01:56:21,242 --> 01:56:27,524
[SPEAKER_18]: keep that funding available for other things such as tennis courts that need to be patched up so people can play on them and a lot of other things.

1110
01:56:28,125 --> 01:56:40,069
[SPEAKER_18]: So I appreciate the mayor's office for putting together a formal recommendation so that we can make that exchange and keep funding sources available for how they're gonna be most effective.

1111
01:56:40,729 --> 01:56:44,871
[SPEAKER_18]: And I would motion to approve pending other comments or questions from my fellow counselors.

1112
01:56:45,431 --> 01:56:47,712
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion to approve by Vice President Collins seconded by.

1113
01:56:48,602 --> 01:56:49,743
[SPEAKER_06]: Seconded by Councilor Sang.

1114
01:56:49,783 --> 01:56:51,905
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there any further questions by members of the council?

1115
01:56:52,966 --> 01:56:53,386
[SPEAKER_06]: Excuse me.

1116
01:56:55,548 --> 01:56:59,191
[SPEAKER_06]: Seeing none, Director Riggi, would you like to say anything at this time?

1117
01:56:59,372 --> 01:57:01,013
[SPEAKER_06]: Just if there's any context you wanna provide?

1118
01:57:06,118 --> 01:57:06,938
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't unmute Matt.

1119
01:57:09,381 --> 01:57:10,221
[SPEAKER_06]: I clicked Matt.

1120
01:57:10,702 --> 01:57:12,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, don't unmute, that's really nice.

1121
01:57:12,503 --> 01:57:14,185
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Director Riggi, you have the floor.

1122
01:57:15,490 --> 01:57:21,144
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, no, I appreciate the council support on these projects.

1123
01:57:23,936 --> 01:57:32,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Much of the money is going to much needed repairs at our fire stations and city hall that for years did not get repairs.

1124
01:57:32,964 --> 01:57:40,230
[SPEAKER_02]: And I am trying to get the backlog of issues in our buildings taken care of.

1125
01:57:40,530 --> 01:57:45,114
[SPEAKER_02]: And with your continued support, we can make headway in that and do that.

1126
01:57:49,630 --> 01:57:50,431
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Director Riggi.

1127
01:57:50,451 --> 01:57:54,694
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate you speaking on this and your work on these projects.

1128
01:57:55,494 --> 01:57:57,476
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1129
01:58:00,578 --> 01:58:01,258
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Kellyanne.

1130
01:58:02,279 --> 01:58:03,140
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Collins.

1131
01:58:03,940 --> 01:58:04,761
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Lozaro.

1132
01:58:05,621 --> 01:58:06,162
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Lemming.

1133
01:58:06,302 --> 01:58:06,522
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1134
01:58:07,082 --> 01:58:07,763
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1135
01:58:09,064 --> 01:58:09,624
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Singh.

1136
01:58:10,165 --> 01:58:10,725
[SPEAKER_09]: President Behrs.

1137
01:58:10,925 --> 01:58:11,165
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1138
01:58:11,225 --> 01:58:13,147
[SPEAKER_06]: Having the affirmative and the negative, the motion passes.

1139
01:58:14,417 --> 01:58:17,560
[SPEAKER_06]: I apologize to my colleagues, but I need to step out early.

1140
01:58:17,860 --> 01:58:20,502
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Collins, if you could take the chair.

1141
01:58:21,622 --> 01:58:24,765
[SPEAKER_06]: And I appreciate my colleagues for their deference.

1142
01:58:24,845 --> 01:58:25,145
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1143
01:58:57,535 --> 01:58:58,776
[SPEAKER_18]: Just give me a second to get on the Zoom.

1144
01:59:27,808 --> 01:59:28,108
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1145
01:59:43,520 --> 01:59:43,780
[SPEAKER_18]: Great.

1146
01:59:44,501 --> 01:59:45,221
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for your patience.

1147
01:59:47,783 --> 01:59:49,605
[SPEAKER_18]: That was onto 25019.

1148
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:56,764
[SPEAKER_18]: offered by Mayor Brianna Lugo-Kern, approval of funding for legal settlement in the amount of $7,500.

1149
01:59:57,285 --> 02:00:05,632
[SPEAKER_18]: Dear President Behrs and members of the City Council, I respectfully request and recommend that, nope, that was the last one.

1150
02:00:08,554 --> 02:00:08,795
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry.

1151
02:00:13,374 --> 02:00:17,678
[SPEAKER_18]: to present bears and honorable members of the city council from Brianna lungo current mayor January 22 2025.

1152
02:00:17,738 --> 02:00:20,401
[SPEAKER_18]: The claimants carrot and just that the.

1153
02:00:23,921 --> 02:00:34,047
[SPEAKER_18]: For Salati, seat compensation for property damage suffered allegedly as a result of a blocked sewer line on High Street resulting in sewage backflow entering the basement of a home located at 206 High Street.

1154
02:00:34,948 --> 02:00:43,633
[SPEAKER_18]: A global settlement has been reached pursuant to which the city will pay $7,500 and the owner slash operator of the nearby Medford Rehabilitation and Nursing Center will pay $7,500.

1155
02:00:44,534 --> 02:00:51,498
[SPEAKER_18]: A form settlement agreement and release has been agreed upon and will be executed upon city council approval of the funding of the settlement.

1156
02:00:52,799 --> 02:00:58,123
[SPEAKER_18]: Attorney Roger Smirage will be in attendance via Zoom to provide the council with guidance on this matter.

1157
02:00:58,183 --> 02:01:03,426
[SPEAKER_18]: Breakdown to amount requested, medical cost, $0, lost wages, $0, property damage, $7,500.

1158
02:01:03,746 --> 02:01:06,628
[SPEAKER_18]: Other $0, total settlement, $7,500.

1159
02:01:07,108 --> 02:01:13,012
[SPEAKER_18]: So I understand that we have legal counsel on the Zoom tonight.

1160
02:01:13,352 --> 02:01:20,197
[SPEAKER_18]: If any, we'll go to the attorney first and then we'll hear comments, questions, or motions from counselors.

1161
02:01:23,969 --> 02:01:24,630
[SPEAKER_10]: Good evening.

1162
02:01:25,970 --> 02:01:27,011
[SPEAKER_10]: Good evening, Vice President.

1163
02:01:27,351 --> 02:01:30,693
[SPEAKER_10]: And my apologies, my camera is not working.

1164
02:01:30,733 --> 02:01:32,774
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm just going to be audio only tonight.

1165
02:01:34,335 --> 02:01:35,196
[SPEAKER_10]: Just I'll be brief.

1166
02:01:35,836 --> 02:01:38,878
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a settlement that we negotiated.

1167
02:01:40,198 --> 02:01:43,780
[SPEAKER_10]: The mayor's letter indicated in a super backup case.

1168
02:01:46,687 --> 02:01:51,249
[SPEAKER_10]: property owners, plaintiffs originally brought suit against the city only.

1169
02:01:52,549 --> 02:02:03,834
[SPEAKER_10]: Working with the public works department, we were able to identify the nearby nursing home as a potential source of the backup issue.

1170
02:02:04,354 --> 02:02:14,317
[SPEAKER_10]: And without having to incur the expense of extended discovery or litigation,

1171
02:02:15,938 --> 02:02:44,247
[SPEAKER_10]: got the nursing home to agree to split proposed settlement 50-50 and negotiated an amount with plaintiff's counsel down from their sought damages of a minimum of $25,000, which amount could have gone up if the case were litigated, to a settlement amount of $15,000 of which the city will only be required to pay $7,500.

1172
02:02:46,492 --> 02:02:47,632
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm happy to answer any questions.

1173
02:02:52,593 --> 02:02:53,893
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you so much attorney for being with us.

1174
02:02:53,913 --> 02:03:05,015
[SPEAKER_18]: So I understand that the initial offer was that the city might've been on the hook for 25,000 and this was able to be negotiated down to 7,500 that the city will pay in addition to the 7,500 from the Medford Rehabilitation Center.

1175
02:03:06,936 --> 02:03:07,556
[SPEAKER_10]: That is correct.

1176
02:03:08,516 --> 02:03:09,456
[SPEAKER_18]: Great, thank you.

1177
02:03:11,396 --> 02:03:14,237
[SPEAKER_18]: On a motion to approve by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Lemming.

1178
02:03:16,437 --> 02:03:16,937

02:03:36,070 --> 02:03:38,432
[SPEAKER_09]: President Behrs is absent.

1194
02:03:38,472 --> 02:03:38,732
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

1195
02:03:38,752 --> 02:03:42,955
[SPEAKER_09]: 6-0 with one absent.

1196
02:03:42,975 --> 02:03:44,276
[SPEAKER_18]: 6 in favor, one absent.

1197
02:03:44,376 --> 02:03:44,996
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion passes.

1198
02:03:45,036 --> 02:03:45,997
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for being with us, attorney.

1199
02:03:46,870 --> 02:03:47,250

1203
02:04:11,437 --> 02:04:28,824

1204
02:04:29,284 --> 02:04:37,027
[SPEAKER_18]: The city will benefit by putting the unused parcels to productive and tax-producing uses, and further, the city may, subject to appropriation by the City Council,

[SPEAKER_18]: for the purpose of promoting affordable housing or for such other purposes as the City Council determines is in the best interest of the city.

1206
02:04:48,012 --> 02:04:51,433
[SPEAKER_18]: A resolution to transfer and authorize the sale of McCormick Avenue parcels.

1207
02:04:52,014 --> 02:05:01,138
[SPEAKER_18]: Whereas the city is the owner of two parcels of land located on McCormick Avenue, each containing 3,600 square feet, more or less, identified in the assessors as parcels F13-37 and F13-38,

[SPEAKER_18]: and described in certificate of title number 166463 filed with the Middlesex South Registry District of the Land Court together the city property.

1209
02:05:15,744 --> 02:05:22,747
[SPEAKER_18]: Whereas the city property has been vacant and unused since the city acquired the city property in 1950 pursuant to a tax taking and is surplus to the needs of the city.

1210
02:05:23,347 --> 02:05:28,289
[SPEAKER_18]: Whereas there is an urgent need to promote and develop affordable housing in the city of Medford and in the region.

1211
02:05:28,910 --> 02:05:34,012
[SPEAKER_18]: Whereas the sale of the city property will benefit the city by putting the city property to productive and tax generating uses.

1212
02:05:34,813 --> 02:05:41,141
[SPEAKER_18]: And whereas the sale of said sale, the proceeds of said sale may be used by the city for the purpose of promoting affordable housing.

1213
02:05:42,463 --> 02:05:48,832
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, therefore, be it that the city council hereby declares that the city property is surplus to the needs of the city and available for disposition.

[SPEAKER_18]: and to take any and all other action as may be necessary or appropriate to accomplish that disposition and that this resolution shall take effect upon passage.

1216
02:06:24,840 --> 02:06:29,324
[SPEAKER_18]: Attorney Everett will be in attendance via Zoom to provide the council with guidance on this matter.

1217
02:06:29,364 --> 02:06:30,645
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for your kind attention.

1218
02:06:30,705 --> 02:06:32,326
[SPEAKER_18]: Sincerely, Brianna Lugar-Curran, Mayor.

1219
02:06:33,687 --> 02:06:38,351
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe I'll first recognize Attorney Everett to give any comments.

1220
02:06:39,652 --> 02:06:40,132
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening.

1221
02:06:41,578 --> 02:06:44,379
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, I'm Attorney Everett.

1222
02:06:44,419 --> 02:06:45,560
[SPEAKER_18]: We're having a hard time hearing you.

1223
02:06:45,600 --> 02:06:48,261
[SPEAKER_18]: Is it possible to speak into your microphone on your end?

1224
02:06:49,081 --> 02:06:49,321
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1225
02:06:49,582 --> 02:06:50,042
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening.

1226
02:06:50,082 --> 02:06:50,962
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you hear me better?

1227
02:06:53,243 --> 02:06:54,224
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't hear her.

1228
02:06:54,244 --> 02:06:56,184
[SPEAKER_18]: We're having a very hard time hearing you in the chambers.

1229
02:06:57,545 --> 02:07:02,207
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, good evening, City Council members.

1230
02:07:03,027 --> 02:07:04,768
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, is this any better?

1231
02:07:05,689 --> 02:07:06,809
[SPEAKER_18]: Can you hold on two seconds?

1232
02:07:06,849 --> 02:07:08,890
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to see if we can adjust some settings in our council booth.

1233
02:07:12,040 --> 02:07:13,180
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, please hang with us.

1234
02:07:28,785 --> 02:07:34,646
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, if you could begin again, Attorney Everett, our audio person is going to try to make some adjustments as you're speaking.

1235
02:07:36,487 --> 02:07:37,187
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you hear me now?

1236
02:07:38,253 --> 02:07:38,853
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, that's better.

1237
02:07:38,873 --> 02:07:39,233
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

1238
02:07:39,253 --> 02:07:39,554
[SPEAKER_18]: Go ahead.

1239
02:07:39,594 --> 02:07:40,054
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you so much.

1240
02:07:40,074 --> 02:07:42,255
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Sarah.

1241
02:07:42,355 --> 02:07:42,755
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening.

1242
02:07:42,795 --> 02:07:44,776
[SPEAKER_14]: This is Sharon Everett from KP Law.

1243
02:07:46,397 --> 02:08:07,366
[SPEAKER_14]: I have been working with the mayor's office to prepare a request for proposals to convey these properties that I believe have been unused for a long time with the hope that the revenues generated from the sale could be used once City Council appropriates the funds for affordable housing purposes.

1244
02:08:09,022 --> 02:08:13,866
[SPEAKER_14]: We drafted a request for proposals, which is almost ready to be sent out.

1245
02:08:14,886 --> 02:08:24,073
[SPEAKER_14]: And the mayor requests your authorization to convey these parcels once a suitable purchaser has been selected.

1246
02:08:25,274 --> 02:08:27,095
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm happy to answer any questions you may have.

1247
02:08:30,073 --> 02:08:31,374
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Attorney Everett.

1248
02:08:31,474 --> 02:08:36,177
[SPEAKER_18]: So the request for proposals is specifically looking for buyers for the properties.

1249
02:08:37,358 --> 02:08:44,303
[SPEAKER_18]: Is the intent here to look for purchases for the properties or to, that will then develop it or just to look for suitable purchases for these properties?

1250
02:08:46,465 --> 02:08:57,093
[SPEAKER_14]: The purpose is to solicit the highest bids because we don't see the property, it may not be as developable or useful for multiple affordable units.

1251
02:08:58,050 --> 02:09:06,232
[SPEAKER_14]: The hope is to sell it to a single person at the highest price, and then to use those proceeds for affordable housing purposes.

1252
02:09:09,453 --> 02:09:13,394
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll turn it on.

1253
02:09:14,074 --> 02:09:20,296
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's first that the council gives up custody to the mayor.

1254
02:09:22,176 --> 02:09:24,217
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's the first thing.

1255
02:09:25,057 --> 02:09:25,657
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, thank you.

1256
02:09:27,130 --> 02:09:37,853
[SPEAKER_18]: Is that correct, Attorney Everett, that this vote is to convey the parcels from their current tax custodianship so that they can be disposed of by the mayor's office?

1257
02:09:38,533 --> 02:09:56,058
[SPEAKER_14]: Right, so when properties held for certain purposes, some specific purposes, and here they're held for tax title purposes, sorry, excuse me, the custody of the property needs to be transferred to the official who will be responsible for the disposition

1258
02:09:57,053 --> 02:09:58,534
[SPEAKER_14]: that being the mayor in this case.

1259
02:09:59,474 --> 02:10:08,917
[SPEAKER_14]: So the request is for City Council to authorize the transfer to the mayor, and then further to authorize the mayor to dispose of those parcels.

1260
02:10:10,238 --> 02:10:10,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1261
02:10:10,558 --> 02:10:11,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli, go ahead.

1262
02:10:11,638 --> 02:10:12,339
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize.

1263
02:10:12,439 --> 02:10:13,559
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, because I'm really confused.

1264
02:10:13,619 --> 02:10:17,620
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the way that it's read that the council has the authority right now.

1265
02:10:18,741 --> 02:10:21,662
[SPEAKER_04]: So we are the ones that allow that, correct?

1266
02:10:22,376 --> 02:10:26,119
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're now getting the authority to do that, right?

1267
02:10:26,199 --> 02:10:46,353
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think this is a good, you know, it's a good step, I think, especially when you're looking for funding the Affordable Housing Trust and looking at avenues that we're looking to support, you know, the unhoused and looking for different avenues and then also looking at a housing shortage.

1268
02:10:47,971 --> 02:11:06,693
[SPEAKER_04]: If I can, can we amend this, I think, Council Vice President, that it's important that I know that when this started discussions some time ago, one of the biggest concerns, and I've got some phone calls from people on Laforma Gap, mentioned that, is there a way that we can add, the Council can add,

1269
02:11:07,394 --> 02:11:33,896
[SPEAKER_04]: giving the mayor the authority, but also making sure that the residents that abut these properties have right of first refusal, because I think that that's what their biggest fear is, is that if a resident that abuts this land right now, if they can take, if they can benefit from that and have control of what goes on next door to them for the house they bought,

1270
02:11:34,655 --> 02:11:46,539
[SPEAKER_04]: when this wasn't in effect, I think it's important that this council protects those residents that abut these opportunities that they have the right of first refusal.

1271
02:11:46,919 --> 02:11:48,919
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that make sense, Vice President?

1272
02:11:48,939 --> 02:11:53,861
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that if council ever can assist us with that, I think it'd be important that

1273
02:11:54,801 --> 02:12:12,786
[SPEAKER_04]: For one, I would make that a formal motion that moving forward, I think that this is something I would support, but I think that what was said and what was mentioned in the past, and again, what was reiterated from the residents of McCormick Gap is that they have the right of first refusal, the abutters of that land.

1274
02:12:13,526 --> 02:12:16,867
[SPEAKER_14]: If I may address that.

1275
02:12:20,408 --> 02:12:22,288
[SPEAKER_14]: If I could address that, please.

1276
02:12:23,817 --> 02:12:25,278
[SPEAKER_14]: Go ahead.

1277
02:12:25,478 --> 02:12:33,623
[SPEAKER_14]: So the city is required to comply with the Uniform Procurement Act to convey any property that is worth over $35,000.

1278
02:12:34,644 --> 02:12:41,108
[SPEAKER_14]: Now the RFP process means that the city has to open it to everybody who is interested in applying for the property.

1279
02:12:42,288 --> 02:12:48,472
[SPEAKER_14]: So it would be inconsistent with the statute that the city is required to comply with

1280
02:12:49,236 --> 02:12:57,302
[SPEAKER_14]: to give rights of first refusal to anybody because that would place them on a better position than anybody else who's bidding.

1281
02:12:57,362 --> 02:13:08,050
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's just, the purpose is to sell it at the highest value and to use those proceeds.

1282
02:13:11,632 --> 02:13:18,257
[SPEAKER_14]: I understand your concerns about the abutters, but 30B does not allow favoritism to be given to anybody.

1283
02:13:19,060 --> 02:13:21,941
[SPEAKER_14]: it has to be even playing field among all parties.

1284
02:13:23,182 --> 02:13:23,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1285
02:13:23,462 --> 02:13:32,405
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so to reiterate legally, we can't ask for that motion obviously now that, uh, and I think this is the biggest fear.

1286
02:13:32,465 --> 02:13:41,889
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that what we're seeing is developers are going to jump on that and they're going to, they're going to come in, they're going to swoop in and all of a sudden they're going to change the face of that neighborhood.

1287
02:13:42,409 --> 02:13:47,991
[SPEAKER_04]: So unfortunately I, I, without that support, I don't think I can, I can support doing this because again,

1288
02:13:49,858 --> 02:13:59,087
[SPEAKER_04]: We're now allowing something that's so good, that can be so beneficial, that I don't think, I don't know if I can support that.

1289
02:13:59,107 --> 02:14:00,768
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you, Council Vice President.

1290
02:14:01,249 --> 02:14:02,370
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1291
02:14:02,390 --> 02:14:04,672
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that's an important question that you raised.

1292
02:14:05,293 --> 02:14:06,574
[SPEAKER_18]: I didn't see who put their hand up.

1293
02:14:06,654 --> 02:14:07,415
[SPEAKER_18]: First, I apologize.

1294
02:14:07,475 --> 02:14:13,220
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll go to Councilor Lemming and then Councilor Kellyanne and then Councilor Sanchez.

1295
02:14:17,063 --> 02:14:39,698
[SPEAKER_08]: So to support this, I've been in, I've had some conversations with the mayor about this particular project, because I've been generally advocating for her to fund an affordable housing nexus study, which would help us to, which would help the city to establish an affordable housing linkage fee program, which would end up

1296
02:14:41,306 --> 02:14:45,571
[SPEAKER_08]: getting a lot more money into affordable housing than that initial investment.

1297
02:14:45,631 --> 02:14:54,220
[SPEAKER_08]: And my understanding is that the revenues from this sale would be able to fund that.

1298
02:14:54,901 --> 02:15:02,209
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, I do share my colleagues' concerns about potentially changing the character of the neighborhood, but I think

1299
02:15:02,740 --> 02:15:07,822
[SPEAKER_08]: a lot of that would be addressed with zoning.

1300
02:15:07,882 --> 02:15:14,004
[SPEAKER_08]: So developers can't necessarily do whatever they want with it.

1301
02:15:14,024 --> 02:15:21,846
[SPEAKER_08]: I do sympathize with the need for right of first refusal, but as the attorney just explained, we can't legally do that.

1302
02:15:22,727 --> 02:15:27,528
[SPEAKER_08]: So given the options, I think it would be best to vote in favor of this.

1303
02:15:27,748 --> 02:15:28,049
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1304
02:15:30,870 --> 02:15:32,090
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Callahan?

1305
02:15:37,658 --> 02:15:45,204
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sorry, I don't have a memorized who's microphone or who's.

1306
02:15:45,964 --> 02:15:46,685
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1307
02:15:46,805 --> 02:15:53,650
[SPEAKER_19]: So as a general rule, I'm often hesitant for the city to sell off its owned property.

1308
02:15:55,351 --> 02:15:56,872
[SPEAKER_19]: And this particular proposal

1309
02:15:58,593 --> 02:16:05,721
[SPEAKER_19]: I have quite a few questions about, we have a newly formed affordable housing trust, it is looking into community land trusts.

1310
02:16:07,002 --> 02:16:14,630
[SPEAKER_19]: It seems like city properties where housing can be built are perfect candidates for community land trust, you know, land.

1311
02:16:16,071 --> 02:16:38,123
[SPEAKER_19]: I am like the language in this seems vaguely to point toward the funding probably being used for portable housing but not necessarily it says for general municipal purposes and or for the purpose of disposition on such terms and conditions as in the best interest of the city like these to me

1312
02:16:39,143 --> 02:16:48,145
[SPEAKER_19]: what we are doing is handing over to the mayor the ability to sell a city property with no conditions, and I am not comfortable with that, with the way that this is worded.

1313
02:16:48,266 --> 02:17:07,571
[SPEAKER_19]: So I would have a lot of questions about how the Affordable Housing Trust fits into this, why there is a rush when the Affordable Housing Trust is probably not really prepared to deal with land right now because they're in the early stages, and we don't yet have a community land trust, why we are now suddenly desperately selling something that has not been used since 1950,

1314
02:17:09,171 --> 02:17:14,894
[SPEAKER_19]: So I have quite a few questions, and I don't believe I will be prepared to vote in favor of this tonight.

1315
02:17:17,136 --> 02:17:18,016
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Councilor Kellyanne.

1316
02:17:18,036 --> 02:17:20,417
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll go next to Councilor Lozano.

1317
02:17:22,138 --> 02:17:22,879
[SPEAKER_18]: Did I get it right this time?

1318
02:17:32,804 --> 02:17:33,805
[SPEAKER_18]: What number microphone are you?

1319
02:17:35,526 --> 02:17:36,126
[SPEAKER_18]: Who's number three?

1320
02:17:37,142 --> 02:17:38,565
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I'm on, I guess.

1321
02:17:38,886 --> 02:17:39,467
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, sorry.

1322
02:17:39,507 --> 02:17:41,592
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, we're going to we're going to go to Emily first.

1323
02:17:41,612 --> 02:17:42,354
[SPEAKER_18]: I apologize.

1324
02:17:42,374 --> 02:17:42,675
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1325
02:17:44,642 --> 02:17:49,304
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know why there's an impression that it's urgent.

1326
02:17:49,684 --> 02:17:53,926
[SPEAKER_15]: I just, I mean, it's on the agenda today, but I don't think it's necessarily urgent.

1327
02:17:53,946 --> 02:18:12,233
[SPEAKER_15]: I just think it's an available parcel of land that we've done nothing with since, or two available parcels of land that we've done nothing with since 1950, and we have an affordable housing trust that's largely unfunded, and we could sell these parcels, we could put that money into

1328
02:18:12,933 --> 02:18:18,718
[SPEAKER_15]: a fund that could build affordable housing, so why wouldn't we, especially as housing prices increase?

1329
02:18:19,619 --> 02:18:20,640
[SPEAKER_15]: I think this is a good use.

1330
02:18:20,780 --> 02:18:25,224
[SPEAKER_15]: If we want to change some of the language to be more specific, I'm comfortable with that.

1331
02:18:27,646 --> 02:18:34,852
[SPEAKER_15]: It doesn't seem desperate or urgent to me, so I think it would be fine to hold until the next meeting.

1332
02:18:35,013 --> 02:18:38,496
[SPEAKER_15]: If we wanted to clarify some of the language, I would be comfortable with that.

1333
02:18:40,577 --> 02:18:45,728
[SPEAKER_15]: verify confirm say for sure this will be in accordance with the law.

1334
02:18:49,060 --> 02:19:05,610
[SPEAKER_15]: sold to whoever is going to comply with our specific zoning requirements and not build outside of those requirements, but that whatever proceeds will come out of it will go into the Affordable Housing Trust.

1335
02:19:05,630 --> 02:19:16,277
[SPEAKER_15]: If we could write that into this, I think that would be appropriate if it's not clear enough here now, because that would be the only reason that I would approve this as it is.

1336
02:19:17,837 --> 02:19:18,058
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1337
02:19:19,572 --> 02:19:19,815
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1338
02:19:22,887 --> 02:19:27,650
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm on the community land trust working group.

1339
02:19:27,690 --> 02:19:35,596
[SPEAKER_08]: It's still very early in the process, but there are a number of city-owned parcels that we're currently investigating.

1340
02:19:39,338 --> 02:19:40,179
[SPEAKER_08]: This isn't one of them.

1341
02:19:40,199 --> 02:19:45,662
[SPEAKER_08]: There are just better options out there for other pieces of land that could be there.

1342
02:19:45,802 --> 02:19:49,225
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't wanna like name any particular parcels because we still need to like

1343
02:19:50,025 --> 02:20:09,341
[SPEAKER_08]: look into each one particularly like individually but this isn't this is just proposing to use the proceeds of that and one of them is to afford a nexus study which would then be used for for the purposes of actually developing a program that would then fund the affordable housing trust.

1344
02:20:09,801 --> 02:20:10,702
[SPEAKER_08]: So it is pretty

1345
02:20:12,623 --> 02:20:19,967
[SPEAKER_08]: needed to get that initial capital in order to fund the studies that would then put more money into the Affordable Housing Trust.

1346
02:20:20,027 --> 02:20:33,314
[SPEAKER_08]: So I mean, I mean, I think that getting getting this through as soon as like, as soon as possible without any delays would be

1347
02:20:35,066 --> 02:20:49,106
[SPEAKER_08]: would be the appropriate move personally just because we have been talking about a nexus study since last year when we were updating the linkage fees and we can't really do any more with the linkage fees until we get that study underway.

1348
02:20:51,670 --> 02:21:09,633
[SPEAKER_08]: So I understand that selling off city-owned land is a pretty, can be a pretty sensitive topic, but if this land hasn't been used since 1950, then I really don't see much of a reason to delay much more on this personally.

1349
02:21:12,496 --> 02:21:13,436
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Councilor Sang.

1350
02:21:13,676 --> 02:21:14,457
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1351
02:21:14,837 --> 02:21:32,623
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand and agree with much of what Councilor Lemmon said, but I do also agree with Councilor Callahan's concerns about the general practice of selling city land, selling public land, which for a long time we've said is very scarce without knowing what the larger roadmap is.

1352
02:21:32,643 --> 02:21:38,565
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess my personal preference would be to table this

1353
02:21:39,933 --> 02:21:50,540
[SPEAKER_07]: and to either have a committee of the whole on this or to have more of a lengthier discussion here next meeting with all councilors present.

1354
02:21:51,061 --> 02:21:58,866
[SPEAKER_07]: That'd be my personal preference, but I do wanna understand if there, maybe this is something that Attorney Everett could answer.

1355
02:21:58,946 --> 02:22:02,168
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there an urgency to this?

1356
02:22:02,268 --> 02:22:04,990
[SPEAKER_07]: Are there any deadlines that we are looking to meet?

1357
02:22:06,090 --> 02:22:12,713
[SPEAKER_07]: by passing this tonight, and I'm also curious about the number of votes that we need to pass this.

1358
02:22:12,793 --> 02:22:15,594
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this a simple majority or two-thirds majority?

1359
02:22:15,974 --> 02:22:17,995
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a two-thirds vote.

1360
02:22:19,176 --> 02:22:27,959
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not aware of any deadlines, but this has been advocated by the mayor's office, and we're trying to get this off the ground.

1361
02:22:29,859 --> 02:22:40,621
[SPEAKER_14]: I would like to mention something some of the councilors questioned as to the reason that the funds are not dedicated expressly towards affordable housing.

1362
02:22:42,121 --> 02:22:50,383
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not the right time to do that because by law, once you sell city property, it has to go to a separate account called the sale of lots account.

1363
02:22:51,603 --> 02:22:57,884
[SPEAKER_14]: And at that time, the funds may be appropriated by city council for affordable housing purposes.

1364
02:22:59,047 --> 02:23:12,517
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're not able to dedicate those funds until they come in, they come into the sale of lot accounts, and then, of course, city council can use that for affordable housing purposes if it so wishes.

1365
02:23:15,413 --> 02:23:15,813
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1366
02:23:16,133 --> 02:23:18,994
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, that I think answers a lot of questions for me.

1367
02:23:19,754 --> 02:23:30,576
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, uh, the, it is helpful to know that the city council will have accountability and oversight over, um, how the money in the sale of lots account will be spent.

1368
02:23:31,356 --> 02:23:42,958
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I would like to make a motion to table, but before I formally make that motion, I see that counselor, um, Lazaro has her hand up and introducing such a motion would end the debate.

1369
02:23:47,915 --> 02:23:50,057
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1370
02:23:50,857 --> 02:24:05,488
[SPEAKER_15]: If the city council appropriates the funds when the parcels are sold, then I am comfortable voting on this tonight because they legally cannot say this will be used for affordable housing because we say that.

1371
02:24:05,929 --> 02:24:12,794
[SPEAKER_15]: So does that, Attorney Everett, does that sound correct to you, the way I phrased that?

1372
02:24:13,334 --> 02:24:14,155
[SPEAKER_14]: That is indeed the law.

1373
02:24:15,541 --> 02:24:30,371
[SPEAKER_18]: Is it, Attorney Everett, if I may piggyback on your question, is it true that if the lots are to be sold for some amount of money, is City Council approval required for any appropriation of that money or just for an appropriation, for example, into the Affordable Housing Trust?

1374
02:24:31,112 --> 02:24:35,435
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, will the City Council oversight on how the funds are used in any case or only in certain cases?

1375
02:24:36,516 --> 02:24:42,720
[SPEAKER_14]: In all cases, monies that are derived from the sale of city property go into the sale of lot accounts.

1376
02:24:43,538 --> 02:24:52,119
[SPEAKER_14]: The law states that those funds are to be used first to repay any debt that the city may have if it acquired the property.

1377
02:24:52,900 --> 02:25:01,401
[SPEAKER_14]: But if there's no debt, as is in this case, then the funds may be appropriated for any purpose for which the city may borrow funds.

1378
02:25:03,962 --> 02:25:06,842
[SPEAKER_14]: So which is pretty much it.

1379
02:25:07,922 --> 02:25:08,422
[SPEAKER_14]: That's correct.

1380
02:25:10,163 --> 02:25:12,163
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a procedural question for the attorney.

1381
02:25:13,191 --> 02:25:23,178
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, given that we have six counselors present out of seven, um, is the two thirds vote based on the six counselors present or the seven sitting members?

1382
02:25:24,179 --> 02:25:24,959
[SPEAKER_14]: It would be the seven.

1383
02:25:26,500 --> 02:25:27,361
[SPEAKER_07]: So we need more votes.

1384
02:25:31,584 --> 02:25:34,166
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll go next to Councilor Callahan.

1385
02:25:36,187 --> 02:25:39,629
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, just a hypothetical question.

1386
02:25:39,649 --> 02:25:40,670
[SPEAKER_19]: Looking down the line, if, um,

1387
02:25:42,933 --> 02:25:53,016
[SPEAKER_19]: this land were not to be sold and were to be, is it possible for the city to transfer ownership of this land to the Affordable Housing Trust or to a community land trust, should we have one?

1388
02:25:55,057 --> 02:26:01,799
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe that the mayor's office reviewed whether it was possible to use this property for affordable housing purposes.

1389
02:26:02,719 --> 02:26:10,202
[SPEAKER_14]: And I could be wrong, but it's my understanding that in reviewing that zoning and issues, it was discovered that

1390
02:26:10,980 --> 02:26:23,345
[SPEAKER_14]: you could use it maybe for one affordable housing family, one family, whereas the goal is to maximize the revenues and perhaps use it to develop multiple affordable units.

1391
02:26:25,526 --> 02:26:36,971
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's, so yes, but to answer your question, yes, the properties could be transferred to the Affordable Housing Trust or to any other city body that you wish.

1392
02:26:38,977 --> 02:26:39,197
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1393
02:26:39,617 --> 02:26:53,643
[SPEAKER_18]: If I may cut in here, I don't want to speculate on the intent of this strategy, nor do I want to put forward the impression that I'm contemplating all of the possible consequences that could come from this.

1394
02:26:54,163 --> 02:27:02,127
[SPEAKER_18]: But I think that one of the questions that this council is deliberating on is if two of our options are to

1395
02:27:03,363 --> 02:27:15,209
[SPEAKER_18]: explore ways when the properties as they currently are could be transferred in some way to the Affordable Housing Trust or Community Land Trust so that affordable housing may be developed there on those lots?

1396
02:27:15,949 --> 02:27:27,254
[SPEAKER_18]: Or should we use the sale of those lots to create funding that theoretically could be used to create more numerous affordable housing units elsewhere in the city?

1397
02:27:28,575 --> 02:27:32,977
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think that that is not a frivolous question because I think that a shared goal is

1398
02:27:33,037 --> 02:27:36,359
[SPEAKER_18]: to make sure that there's affordable housing available everywhere throughout the city.

1399
02:27:36,999 --> 02:27:43,063
[SPEAKER_18]: Of course, some areas of the city we need dense housing, we need a lot of affordable housing, but we need affordable housing in every area of the city.

1400
02:27:44,484 --> 02:27:49,327
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't make motions, but I would certainly feel more comfortable voting on this if we met in a community hall.

1401
02:27:50,387 --> 02:28:03,761
[SPEAKER_18]: And if we met in a committee of the whole with a representative from the mayor's team, perhaps with members of the Affordable Housing Trust and other city staff to remain to the issue to make sure that we're kind of aware of the whole flowchart of options.

1402
02:28:05,007 --> 02:28:14,332
[SPEAKER_18]: from the sale, perhaps with a memo from the mayor's office outlining their intent in pursuing the RFP route that they have been pursuing.

1403
02:28:14,812 --> 02:28:17,954
[SPEAKER_18]: Essentially, you know, this is coming to the city council after a lot of thought has already gone into it.

1404
02:28:17,994 --> 02:28:19,895
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sure that that thought has been done in good faith.

1405
02:28:21,415 --> 02:28:23,156
[SPEAKER_18]: But this is a big deal.

1406
02:28:23,897 --> 02:28:26,278
[SPEAKER_18]: Transferring city property so it can be sold is a big deal.

1407
02:28:26,658 --> 02:28:30,400
[SPEAKER_18]: And as one councilor who can't make motions, I would feel more comfortable if we had time to deliberate on it.

1408
02:28:31,232 --> 02:28:45,056
[SPEAKER_07]: I would motion to table pending a committee of the whole with inviting members of the administration, the Affordable Housing Trust and other stakeholders.

1409
02:28:45,116 --> 02:28:45,597
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1410
02:28:46,677 --> 02:28:46,837
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

1411
02:28:47,425 --> 02:28:59,550
[SPEAKER_18]: on the motion to table by Councilor Seng pending a meeting in a committee of the whole with pertinent members of the Mayor's Administration and representatives from the Affordable Housing Trust, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

1412
02:29:00,491 --> 02:29:01,131
[SPEAKER_18]: All those in favor?

1413
02:29:01,151 --> 02:29:01,731
[SPEAKER_18]: Aye.

1414
02:29:02,351 --> 02:29:02,972
[SPEAKER_18]: All those opposed?

1415
02:29:04,772 --> 02:29:10,355
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion passes and the paper will be tabled and myself and President Behrs will

1416
02:29:11,492 --> 02:29:16,015
[SPEAKER_18]: work to get that committee of the whole set up with supporting documents and research.

1417
02:29:16,876 --> 02:29:19,538
[SPEAKER_18]: Attorney Everett, thank you so much for being on the call with us this evening.

1418
02:29:19,578 --> 02:29:20,298
[SPEAKER_18]: We really appreciate it.

1419
02:29:21,099 --> 02:29:21,919
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for your time.

1420
02:29:22,039 --> 02:29:22,400
[SPEAKER_14]: Good night.

1421
02:29:23,280 --> 02:29:23,601
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1422
02:29:26,723 --> 02:29:29,204
[SPEAKER_18]: We move now to public participation.

1423
02:29:29,224 --> 02:29:34,008
[SPEAKER_18]: Any member who wishes to speak can approach the podium.

1424
02:29:34,788 --> 02:29:38,531
[SPEAKER_18]: You have to give your name and address for the record, and then you'll have three minutes to address the council.

1425
02:29:41,742 --> 02:29:42,562
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, hang on one sec.

1426
02:29:43,763 --> 02:29:44,103
[SPEAKER_18]: There you go.

1427
02:29:44,123 --> 02:29:44,823
[SPEAKER_18]: Now your mic is live.

1428
02:29:44,863 --> 02:29:46,384
[SPEAKER_18]: Name and address for the record, please.

1429
02:29:46,424 --> 02:29:47,245
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Mei.

1430
02:29:47,945 --> 02:29:50,146
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in Malden, 19 Phillips Street.

1431
02:29:51,086 --> 02:29:52,167
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, everyone.

1432
02:29:52,187 --> 02:29:52,647
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening.

1433
02:29:52,867 --> 02:29:53,567
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Mei.

1434
02:29:54,548 --> 02:30:03,192
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a practitioner of Falun Gong, a Buddhist spiritual practice that is guided under the principles of truthfulness, compassion, and forbearance.

1435
02:30:04,032 --> 02:30:09,415
[SPEAKER_00]: By 1999, the Chinese government saw the practice as a threat to its political power.

1436
02:30:10,115 --> 02:30:16,022
[SPEAKER_00]: and therefore labeled Falun Gong as an evil cult and started a national campaign against Falun Gong.

1437
02:30:16,742 --> 02:30:19,986
[SPEAKER_00]: Since then, the Falun Gong practitioners have been persecuted.

1438
02:30:20,667 --> 02:30:30,538
[SPEAKER_00]: The persecution includes detention, brainwashing, labor camps, torture, and even organ harvesting from living practitioners.

1439
02:30:31,608 --> 02:30:34,991
[SPEAKER_00]: My family was impacted under this persecution when I was in high school.

1440
02:30:35,231 --> 02:30:38,594
[SPEAKER_00]: My mother was arrested and forced to quit her job.

1441
02:30:39,234 --> 02:30:42,217
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my family was monitored by the local police.

1442
02:30:42,717 --> 02:30:49,342
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of our fellow practitioners were detained, sentenced, and tortured simply because of their faith.

1443
02:30:50,483 --> 02:30:52,285
[SPEAKER_00]: We immigrated to the U.S.

1444
02:30:52,505 --> 02:30:58,130
[SPEAKER_00]: to escape the persecution in China, and we are now grateful to freely practice our beliefs today.

1445
02:30:58,330 --> 02:31:00,952
[SPEAKER_00]: And today I'm very proud to be an American citizen.

1446
02:31:01,882 --> 02:31:16,704
[SPEAKER_00]: In my free time, I have become a volunteer to promote sharing performing arts, which was founded by Falun Gong practitioners in 2006 with a mission to revive China's 5000 years divinely inspired traditional culture.

1447
02:31:17,705 --> 02:31:21,847
[SPEAKER_00]: Among the Xinyuan artists are some of the practitioners who were persecuted in China.

1448
02:31:22,608 --> 02:31:31,752
[SPEAKER_00]: The performance also tries to bring attention to the ongoing persecution of Falun Gong, which is a part of our peaceful efforts to resist the persecution.

1449
02:31:32,893 --> 02:31:43,157
[SPEAKER_00]: However, in the last six months, the Chinese Communist regime has escalated tremendously the persecution of Falun Gong and Shen Yun on the U.S.

1450
02:31:43,257 --> 02:31:47,099
[SPEAKER_00]: soil with bomb threats and other threats of violence.

1451
02:31:47,659 --> 02:31:55,602
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, during Shen Yun's tour last year, bomb threats were made in three different countries in just one week.

1452
02:31:56,782 --> 02:32:00,724
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, leading up to the first performance of this year in Georgia,

1453
02:32:01,298 --> 02:32:09,304
[SPEAKER_00]: Xie Yun received an email threatening if the theater like Xie Yun performed, the audience would be shot during the show.

1454
02:32:10,264 --> 02:32:13,907
[SPEAKER_00]: The email even included a photo of handgun and bullets.

1455
02:32:15,163 --> 02:32:23,269
[SPEAKER_00]: When the CCP's attempts to shut down Shen Yun by making threats failed, it pivoted to manipulating public opinion.

1456
02:32:24,310 --> 02:32:41,383
[SPEAKER_00]: According to the leaked CCP documents, congressional testimonies from former Chinese diplomats, and third party investigations, the CCP has enacted operations around the world to silence, marginalize, and surprise Falun Gong.

1457
02:32:42,644 --> 02:32:59,852
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, the CCP's transnational repression strategies include social media trolling, lawfare, media manipulation, co-opting the government, and impersonating practitioners in order to make false and damaging claims.

1458
02:32:59,872 --> 02:33:11,077
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm deeply concerned that the CCP's influence will stretch into communities like ours, where practitioners and their families are not free from intimidation.

1459
02:33:12,261 --> 02:33:24,426
[SPEAKER_00]: I urge our local officials, committee leaders, and fellow residents to stand in solidarity with those who are fighting for their right to practice their faith and express their culture freely.

1460
02:33:25,346 --> 02:33:37,451
[SPEAKER_00]: We must resist the CCP's efforts to extend this oppressive influence into our lives here in America and work together to safeguard the rights of those who cherish freedom.

1461
02:33:38,664 --> 02:33:44,968
[SPEAKER_00]: Today is Lunar New Year's Eve, and I'm fortunate to come back with my parents to eat dumplings.

1462
02:33:45,428 --> 02:33:55,134
[SPEAKER_00]: But thousands of practitioners and political prisoners are aparted from their family, and their children have become orphans because of the persecution.

1463
02:33:55,734 --> 02:33:59,696
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think my fellow practitioner would like to share her story.

1464
02:33:59,776 --> 02:34:00,136
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1465
02:34:01,777 --> 02:34:02,838
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you so much for your comments.

1466
02:34:04,459 --> 02:34:04,619
[SPEAKER_18]: Great.

1467
02:34:05,293 --> 02:34:05,633
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1468
02:34:05,673 --> 02:34:06,874
[SPEAKER_18]: Name and address for the record, please.

1469
02:34:06,914 --> 02:34:07,794
[SPEAKER_18]: And you have three minutes as well.

1470
02:34:07,814 --> 02:34:08,414
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for being here.

1471
02:34:08,454 --> 02:34:08,955
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello, everyone.

1472
02:34:09,395 --> 02:34:10,435
[SPEAKER_13]: My name is Ping.

1473
02:34:11,216 --> 02:34:14,957
[SPEAKER_13]: I live in Winchester, 14 Park Road.

1474
02:34:18,298 --> 02:34:19,039
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, everyone.

1475
02:34:19,119 --> 02:34:23,000
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for giving me the opportunity to be here.

1476
02:34:23,020 --> 02:34:28,323
[SPEAKER_13]: I have been a Falun Gong practitioner since I was 12 years old.

1477
02:34:29,223 --> 02:34:33,465
[SPEAKER_13]: The practice has taught me how to be a truly good person.

1478
02:34:34,763 --> 02:34:44,631
[SPEAKER_13]: In the earlier part of the persecution, my grandpa was arrested and imprisoned for speaking the truth to the government.

1479
02:34:45,692 --> 02:34:50,675
[SPEAKER_13]: He was tortured in the prison and passed away shortly after his release.

1480
02:34:51,936 --> 02:34:55,839
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, I'd like to share another story with you.

1481
02:34:56,520 --> 02:35:04,186
[SPEAKER_13]: It's another Falun Gong practitioner and a singing performer whose family was torn apart due to the persecution.

1482
02:35:05,911 --> 02:35:12,573
[SPEAKER_13]: And to use Zoom to share this with you.

1483
02:35:13,414 --> 02:35:13,774
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1484
02:35:13,794 --> 02:35:17,015
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't usually do screen sharing from public presentation.

1485
02:35:17,035 --> 02:35:18,135
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh.

1486
02:35:18,295 --> 02:35:20,316
[SPEAKER_18]: But you have two more minutes if you'd like to continue your comments.

1487
02:35:21,697 --> 02:35:22,137
[SPEAKER_13]: OK.

1488
02:35:25,018 --> 02:35:25,178
[SPEAKER_13]: So.

1489
02:35:27,500 --> 02:35:40,066
[SPEAKER_13]: So since 1999, millions of Falun Gong practitioners have been tortured or killed in China by the CCP.

1490
02:35:40,627 --> 02:35:51,752
[SPEAKER_13]: Because the CCP don't like any types of religions, they don't allow us to believe in God.

1491
02:35:52,712 --> 02:35:55,274
[SPEAKER_13]: So as Ming-Qian mentioned,

1492
02:35:57,588 --> 02:36:13,034
[SPEAKER_13]: Now it's deeply troubling and unexpected that the CCP has been employing various forms of transnational tactics to intimidate and silence practitioners here on US soil.

1493
02:36:13,974 --> 02:36:20,536
[SPEAKER_13]: These actions are a direct threat to the religious freedom protect in the United States.

1494
02:36:21,637 --> 02:36:21,877
[SPEAKER_13]: So,

1495
02:36:25,285 --> 02:36:28,327
[SPEAKER_13]: it must not be tolerated.

1496
02:36:28,887 --> 02:36:37,232
[SPEAKER_13]: So please be aware of CCP's tactics and stand with us in addressing and countering them.

1497
02:36:37,812 --> 02:36:38,352
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1498
02:36:39,873 --> 02:36:40,874
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you very much for being with us today.

1499
02:36:40,894 --> 02:36:41,094
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1500
02:36:48,498 --> 02:36:52,040
[SPEAKER_18]: Is there anybody else for public participation in the chambers or on Zoom?

1501
02:36:56,304 --> 02:37:02,666
[SPEAKER_05]: I just think that was a very good reminder for those of us that advocate relentlessly for limited government.

1502
02:37:03,527 --> 02:37:05,188
[SPEAKER_05]: I just got a question.

1503
02:37:06,548 --> 02:37:17,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Councillor Lazaro mentioned that on Thursday, there's a meeting at the senior center, but I'm on the webpage of the Met for Events calendar, and I don't see it.

1504
02:37:18,694 --> 02:37:21,595
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was wondering where I can find information for that meeting.

1505
02:37:22,902 --> 02:37:25,604
[SPEAKER_05]: I only see a Zoning Board of Appeals meeting at 6.30 p.m.

1506
02:37:25,624 --> 02:37:31,187
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the only event listed on Thursday, January 30.

1507
02:37:31,307 --> 02:37:33,928
[SPEAKER_18]: I recognize Councilor Lozano, if you want to respond.

1508
02:37:34,709 --> 02:37:47,356
[SPEAKER_15]: The listening session is advertised in the newsletter of the Senior Center, and it'll also be in the newsletter that we're releasing.

1509
02:37:50,405 --> 02:37:52,265
[SPEAKER_15]: from the Resident Services Committee.

1510
02:37:52,926 --> 02:37:58,547
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a meeting tomorrow to revise that and that will be released after that meeting.

1511
02:37:59,947 --> 02:38:04,848
[SPEAKER_15]: But I am not aware of how things go on the events calendar.

1512
02:38:06,909 --> 02:38:10,610
[SPEAKER_15]: Pam Kelly is the director of the

1513
02:38:11,809 --> 02:38:21,373
[SPEAKER_15]: Senior Center, so she puts it in the, we tell her a month ahead of time, she puts it on the newsletter for the Senior Center, so it's like a paper newsletter.

1514
02:38:22,333 --> 02:38:25,775
[SPEAKER_15]: It also gets emailed out if you're on the list.

1515
02:38:26,995 --> 02:38:29,216
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so I just checked the website of the Senior Center.

1516
02:38:29,756 --> 02:38:30,196
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thank you.

1517
02:38:31,317 --> 02:38:31,757
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.

1518
02:38:33,130 --> 02:38:34,110
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Councilor Lozaro.

1519
02:38:34,150 --> 02:38:46,734
[SPEAKER_18]: In my understanding, I'm not a member of the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee, but my understanding is that with the listening sessions, the target audience is the folks who organically gather at the community center where the listening sessions are.

1520
02:38:46,774 --> 02:39:00,999
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm sure that the promotion is focused on those folks who are already going to be there for various purposes so that the frequent attendees, rather than the broader general public, can be met by councilors at these places that they are already going.

1521
02:39:07,685 --> 02:39:08,525
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, that's correct.

1522
02:39:08,585 --> 02:39:19,688
[SPEAKER_15]: The idea is to be in the community in the spaces where people are gathered and to be reaching out to different groups in the community and meeting them where they are.

1523
02:39:20,769 --> 02:39:24,990
[SPEAKER_15]: But while I'm here, if I can make a motion to adjourn, I will do so.

1524
02:39:25,250 --> 02:39:27,450
[SPEAKER_15]: If there are no other public participation folks.

1525
02:39:27,871 --> 02:39:33,272
[SPEAKER_18]: I see no other candidates for public participation on Zoom or in person.

1526
02:39:35,475 --> 02:39:38,026
[SPEAKER_18]: Seeing none, is there a second for the motion to adjourn?

1527
02:39:38,307 --> 02:39:39,231
[SPEAKER_18]: Seconded by Councilor Sang.

1528
02:39:40,175 --> 02:39:40,757
[SPEAKER_18]: All in favor?

1529
02:39:40,777 --> 02:39:41,500
[SPEAKER_18]: Aye.

1530
02:39:41,942 --> 02:39:42,444
[SPEAKER_18]: All opposed?

1531
02:39:43,147 --> 02:39:43,809
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion passes.

1532
02:39:43,829 --> 02:39:44,412
[SPEAKER_18]: Meeting is adjourned.

1533
02:39:44,432 --> 02:39:44,693
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.
