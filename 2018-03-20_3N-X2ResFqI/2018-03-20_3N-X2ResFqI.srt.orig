[SPEAKER_13]: Meeting of the Medford School Committee will now come to order.

00:01:12,143 --> 00:01:13,564

Here.

[SPEAKER_14]: Here.

00:01:25,492 --> 00:01:25,732
[SPEAKER_14]: Here.

16
00:01:26,512 --> 00:01:27,373
[SPEAKER_14]: You may have her.

17
00:01:27,393 --> 00:01:27,853
[SPEAKER_13]: Present.

18
00:01:27,953 --> 00:01:29,054
[SPEAKER_13]: Seven present, none absent.

19
00:01:29,094 --> 00:01:30,555
[SPEAKER_13]: All please rise and salute our flag.

20
00:01:31,235 --> 00:01:35,018
[SPEAKER_13]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America.

21
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:42,901
[SPEAKER_13]: and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

22
00:01:44,702 --> 00:01:46,382
[SPEAKER_13]: Approval of the minutes of the March 5, 2018 meeting.

23
00:01:46,402 --> 00:01:47,202
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion to approve.

24
00:01:47,222 --> 00:01:51,403
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a motion to approve on the floor.

25
00:01:51,443 --> 00:01:52,123
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a second?

26
00:01:52,263 --> 00:01:52,903
[SPEAKER_13]: Seconded by Ms.

27
00:01:52,923 --> 00:01:53,483
[SPEAKER_13]: Van de Kloot.

28
00:01:53,924 --> 00:01:54,664
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

29
00:01:54,684 --> 00:01:55,464
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

30
00:01:55,484 --> 00:01:56,264
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

31
00:01:56,804 --> 00:01:57,484
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

32
00:01:58,704 --> 00:02:00,465
[SPEAKER_13]: Approval of bills, transfer of funds.

33
00:02:02,307 --> 00:02:03,028
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Benedetto?

34
00:02:04,009 --> 00:02:09,175
[SPEAKER_11]: I had a few questions on page 5 of 10.

35
00:02:10,236 --> 00:02:16,864
[SPEAKER_11]: Third item down, it says Motty's Caterers, and then the account description says Textbooks DW.

36
00:02:17,265 --> 00:02:19,167
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure it was just maybe an error.

37
00:02:19,667 --> 00:02:21,850
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think we're paying Motty's Caterers for textbooks.

38
00:02:33,492 --> 00:02:35,632
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the third item down on page five, Christy.

39
00:02:36,633 --> 00:02:38,333
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, so I need to look at the nature of that.

40
00:02:39,293 --> 00:02:46,634
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, and the other one is on the next page, page six of 10, about 10 items down.

41
00:02:46,754 --> 00:02:48,635
[SPEAKER_11]: It says North Shore Rental, Inc.

42
00:02:48,775 --> 00:02:50,895
[SPEAKER_11]: And it also says Textbooks DW.

43
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:54,676
[SPEAKER_11]: Other than that, they look great.

44
00:02:55,376 --> 00:03:00,637
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think it just could have been clicked differently or some easy error.

45
00:03:00,737 --> 00:03:02,897
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, someone has something to say.

46
00:03:04,748 --> 00:03:07,130
[SPEAKER_11]: Bernadette raised her hand like she wanted to say.

47
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:08,270
[SPEAKER_11]: Mrs. Riccadeli.

48
00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:41,682
[SPEAKER_11]: So will we get a correction on that when the money's transferred from one?

49
00:03:42,523 --> 00:03:45,204
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the correction is that the journal entry will be made in the amount that the piece of credit collected.

50
00:03:45,224 --> 00:03:49,547
[SPEAKER_10]: So yes, that will be within that account.

51
00:03:49,567 --> 00:03:52,710
[SPEAKER_11]: And we'll get notification of that happening, or our secretary?

52
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,691
[SPEAKER_13]: In the financial statements, not in this.

53
00:03:55,532 --> 00:03:55,712
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

54
00:03:55,872 --> 00:03:56,772
[SPEAKER_13]: This is like a voucher.

55
00:03:57,553 --> 00:04:00,335
[SPEAKER_13]: It'll be in the actual financial statements, a journal entry moving it.

56
00:04:01,476 --> 00:04:01,596
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

57
00:04:02,163 --> 00:04:05,845
[SPEAKER_11]: And we don't get no, we don't not required to get no, I don't know how that works.

58
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:07,926
[SPEAKER_13]: It goes through the auditor's office and city hall.

59
00:04:08,466 --> 00:04:08,787
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

60
00:04:08,987 --> 00:04:11,668
[SPEAKER_11]: I just, when it comes up like that, I just question it.

61
00:04:14,389 --> 00:04:14,670
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

62
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,070
[SPEAKER_11]: That makes sense.

63
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:22,254
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion to approve on the motion for approval as seconded by Mr Russo roll call vote, please.

64
00:04:24,115 --> 00:04:24,335
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

65
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:34,367
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

66
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:35,087
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

67
00:04:35,627 --> 00:04:36,487
[SPEAKER_13]: Approval of payrolls.

68
00:04:36,828 --> 00:04:37,308
[SPEAKER_13]: Mayor Burke.

69
00:04:37,648 --> 00:04:38,328
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Benedetto.

70
00:04:38,848 --> 00:04:39,649
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mayor Burke.

71
00:04:40,609 --> 00:04:47,292
[SPEAKER_11]: An item last week, last meeting that was brought up that was tabled asking for the payroll.

72
00:04:48,292 --> 00:04:53,074
[SPEAKER_11]: Kirsten was nice enough to get that together and send it to us last Friday afternoon.

73
00:04:53,614 --> 00:04:54,455
[SPEAKER_11]: So I put it,

74
00:04:56,137 --> 00:04:58,359
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it was a really busy weekend.

75
00:04:58,419 --> 00:05:04,564
[SPEAKER_11]: I was looking at wedding gowns with my daughter, so I didn't get to this till late yesterday and was at work today.

76
00:05:04,624 --> 00:05:13,892
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just emailed everybody a copy of this report that I put on your desk with some concerns on base salaries for some employees.

77
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:19,297
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know Kirsten didn't have a chance to review this ahead of time, and again, I'm sorry.

78
00:05:20,418 --> 00:05:22,419
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, Kirsten, I apologize.

79
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:23,080
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

80
00:05:23,813 --> 00:05:31,734
[SPEAKER_11]: So I have highlighted some concerns when I compared the salary to the budget book.

81
00:05:33,855 --> 00:05:35,275
[SPEAKER_11]: And I didn't do everybody.

82
00:05:35,415 --> 00:05:36,475
[SPEAKER_11]: I did like three teachers.

83
00:05:36,515 --> 00:05:37,515
[SPEAKER_11]: They were all correct.

84
00:05:37,575 --> 00:05:39,116
[SPEAKER_11]: I did some administrators.

85
00:05:39,196 --> 00:05:40,196
[SPEAKER_11]: They looked pretty good.

86
00:05:41,036 --> 00:05:45,577
[SPEAKER_11]: The areas that I saw a pattern, I kept looking more and more.

87
00:05:46,017 --> 00:05:52,098
[SPEAKER_11]: And in the finance department, there were a lot of admin assistants or secretaries that

88
00:05:52,421 --> 00:05:55,743
[SPEAKER_11]: their base pay didn't look the same as our budget book.

89
00:05:56,264 --> 00:05:58,225
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I can give you a couple examples.

90
00:05:58,285 --> 00:05:59,966
[SPEAKER_11]: I know you have the packet in front of you as well.

91
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:07,952
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, so what you know is that that's a plan at that point in time when we're preparing those.

92
00:06:08,332 --> 00:06:13,356
[SPEAKER_10]: So the appropriate adjustments, step increases, COLAs, have all been made throughout the year.

93
00:06:13,716 --> 00:06:19,821
[SPEAKER_10]: So again, this is referencing the March 15th payroll as it applies to what was reported.

94
00:06:20,341 --> 00:06:21,562
[SPEAKER_11]: Right, in that budget,

95
00:06:22,225 --> 00:06:27,646
[SPEAKER_11]: This book that was approved was including those increases for all staff.

96
00:06:27,706 --> 00:06:33,227
[SPEAKER_11]: And not all staff received the increase, so everybody would receive an increase, and that's not the case.

97
00:06:33,347 --> 00:06:35,428
[SPEAKER_11]: The differences are random.

98
00:06:35,848 --> 00:06:38,088
[SPEAKER_11]: Some people got them, and some others didn't.

99
00:06:38,168 --> 00:06:44,089
[SPEAKER_11]: So it would make sense to me if everybody got a step increase.

100
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:51,391
[SPEAKER_11]: But some people, it looks like it could be two or three steps, and some people are one step, and some people have no raise increase.

101
00:06:51,855 --> 00:06:55,676
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's concerning, and we're responsible.

102
00:06:55,836 --> 00:06:56,936
[SPEAKER_11]: We vote on this payroll.

103
00:06:56,996 --> 00:06:58,837
[SPEAKER_11]: We should know what is right.

104
00:06:59,037 --> 00:07:02,458
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm not a CPA, but I put a spreadsheet together.

105
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:07,579
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't look at longevity or overtime, because those are listed out separately.

106
00:07:07,899 --> 00:07:12,320
[SPEAKER_11]: I just looked at base pay, because that's what I have in our budget book, and I compared them.

107
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:20,322
[SPEAKER_11]: And I took the salary for that week, multiplied it by 26, which would be the annual income, because I didn't get the year-to-date column.

108
00:07:20,869 --> 00:07:24,110
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just, and I clarified that with you.

109
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:26,591
[SPEAKER_11]: I sent you an email saying, hey, do I multiply this by 24?

110
00:07:27,251 --> 00:07:30,552
[SPEAKER_11]: Are we bi-monthly or are we bi-weekly?

111
00:07:31,732 --> 00:07:33,813
[SPEAKER_11]: So you said we would buy things.

112
00:07:33,873 --> 00:07:37,454
[SPEAKER_11]: So I, late last night, I did it on Excel.

113
00:07:37,514 --> 00:07:40,295
[SPEAKER_11]: I put the gross wages you sent me, the PDF.

114
00:07:40,435 --> 00:07:42,716
[SPEAKER_11]: I transferred it to an Excel document.

115
00:07:43,816 --> 00:07:49,818
[SPEAKER_11]: I made a formula at taking the gross wages, multiplied it by 26, and got that column.

116
00:07:50,327 --> 00:07:55,189
[SPEAKER_11]: I kept the check date so that way everybody knew exactly what pay period it was.

117
00:07:55,770 --> 00:08:01,472
[SPEAKER_11]: Then I put in the budget book salary for the people that I checked that I saw differences.

118
00:08:02,853 --> 00:08:07,455
[SPEAKER_11]: Some people aren't being paid enough, and some people are overpaid.

119
00:08:08,076 --> 00:08:13,538
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't want to say names, so I will, like for instance, I will use initials so you can follow along.

120
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:14,839
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all alphabetical.

121
00:08:15,459 --> 00:08:16,620
[SPEAKER_11]: So like on the,

122
00:08:17,475 --> 00:08:22,696
[SPEAKER_11]: Fourth page down, last name C, first name K, it's highlighted so you should be able to find it.

123
00:08:23,617 --> 00:08:26,537
[SPEAKER_11]: Their weekly pay rate was $19.4742.

124
00:08:26,717 --> 00:08:30,138
[SPEAKER_11]: If you multiply that by 26 to get the annual, it should be $50,632.92.

125
00:08:30,178 --> 00:08:33,719
[SPEAKER_11]: The budget book that we approved, their raise included, should be $46,138.

126
00:08:46,227 --> 00:08:52,470
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a difference that that person possibly could be overpaid by $4,494 based on this.

127
00:08:53,711 --> 00:08:57,453
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not including overtime or anything.

128
00:08:57,593 --> 00:08:59,674
[SPEAKER_11]: And I have 19 examples.

129
00:08:59,954 --> 00:09:05,717
[SPEAKER_11]: I would have done more, but again, I didn't start this till late yesterday because I got it Friday.

130
00:09:06,438 --> 00:09:08,919
[SPEAKER_11]: I had my aunt and I had

131
00:09:09,453 --> 00:09:11,735
[SPEAKER_11]: wedding dress shopping, which was a lot of fun.

132
00:09:12,136 --> 00:09:13,037
[SPEAKER_10]: If I may, yes.

133
00:09:13,517 --> 00:09:18,502
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, all of these items are addressed and documented through the payroll system.

134
00:09:18,983 --> 00:09:22,947
[SPEAKER_10]: We have multiple changes, status changes throughout the course of a year.

135
00:09:23,347 --> 00:09:24,849
[SPEAKER_10]: A budget book is not static.

136
00:09:25,089 --> 00:09:25,790
[SPEAKER_10]: It is a plan.

137
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:28,853
[SPEAKER_10]: Going forward, there are changes that are identified.

138
00:09:29,285 --> 00:09:31,667
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, and I have changes that Ms.

139
00:09:31,767 --> 00:09:32,667
[SPEAKER_10]: DeBelsen brought.

140
00:09:33,068 --> 00:09:35,149
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.

141
00:09:35,189 --> 00:09:40,613
[SPEAKER_10]: There are many items that are explainable had I had an opportunity to review these.

142
00:09:40,993 --> 00:09:42,735
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't read some of these items.

143
00:09:42,775 --> 00:09:43,876
[SPEAKER_10]: They're darkened and black.

144
00:09:44,336 --> 00:09:48,419
[SPEAKER_10]: So I can't respond accordingly to some of these inquiries that you have.

145
00:09:49,059 --> 00:09:49,339
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

146
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:58,386
[SPEAKER_11]: And what I also have is in June 19th of last year, after the budget was approved,

147
00:09:59,109 --> 00:10:09,694
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Belson came to a school committee meeting and we went into executive session and he brought forth a list of people he requested 2.5% raises on.

148
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:12,036
[SPEAKER_11]: And I have those lists.

149
00:10:13,096 --> 00:10:19,960
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of them were principals, people who are not under union that he would need to do this for.

150
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,281
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of them were administrators.

151
00:10:23,922 --> 00:10:25,743
[SPEAKER_11]: Yours was one of them as well.

152
00:10:27,644 --> 00:10:27,964
[SPEAKER_11]: And then,

153
00:10:28,812 --> 00:10:39,857
[SPEAKER_11]: He also came forward for some confidential secretaries or administrative assistants that he brought forward that he felt needed to be brought up.

154
00:10:39,917 --> 00:10:41,558
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're not in bargaining.

155
00:10:41,998 --> 00:10:42,778
[SPEAKER_11]: They're, you know.

156
00:10:42,798 --> 00:10:42,898
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

157
00:10:42,918 --> 00:10:45,199
[SPEAKER_11]: And they've all been documented with personnel.

158
00:10:45,219 --> 00:10:45,379
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

159
00:10:45,419 --> 00:10:46,900
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I have all those documents.

160
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:54,964
[SPEAKER_11]: So the ones that I'm talking about in these differences are union people who only should be going up the step and some have and some haven't.

161
00:10:56,518 --> 00:11:02,022
[SPEAKER_11]: It should be all or none, because they're in line with the collective bargaining units.

162
00:11:02,043 --> 00:11:04,084
[SPEAKER_13]: You've run through the steps in your years of service.

163
00:11:04,184 --> 00:11:07,947
[SPEAKER_13]: So in some cases, you may get a bump for your step increase.

164
00:11:08,347 --> 00:11:11,190
[SPEAKER_13]: If you've already gone through the steps, then you no longer get that bump.

165
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:12,711
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I have the steps listed.

166
00:11:12,731 --> 00:11:19,416
[SPEAKER_13]: Why don't we give Christine an opportunity to take this back to the office, look at your highlighted ones, and she can provide explanations.

167
00:11:19,896 --> 00:11:20,177
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

168
00:11:20,337 --> 00:11:23,599
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not fair to put her, she just got this document tonight.

169
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:24,460
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not fair to put her.

170
00:11:25,395 --> 00:11:26,635
[SPEAKER_13]: under the microscope this evening.

171
00:11:27,175 --> 00:11:27,395
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

172
00:11:27,736 --> 00:11:29,656
[SPEAKER_11]: And I can appreciate that.

173
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:36,078
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would request at this time that we have a meeting of finances as a committee of the whole.

174
00:11:36,098 --> 00:11:41,479
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't have a subcommittee group, so I would like to send this to the committee of the whole to discuss finances.

175
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:47,300
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, I know it will have to be televised because we need to, it's public record and it's transparency.

176
00:11:47,701 --> 00:11:53,542
[SPEAKER_11]: So in lieu of everything, I really think that it's very important that we're very clear

177
00:11:54,143 --> 00:12:00,372
[SPEAKER_11]: and very transparent, especially lately, about what we're doing, and so that the whole community can see it.

178
00:12:00,693 --> 00:12:03,236
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm requesting that this meeting happen right away.

179
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:04,618
[SPEAKER_11]: This involves people's pay.

180
00:12:04,899 --> 00:12:07,322
[SPEAKER_11]: Because if people are being paid $4,000 extra,

181
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:13,127
[SPEAKER_11]: What happens if it was a mistake or it was granted when it shouldn't have been?

182
00:12:13,387 --> 00:12:14,347
[SPEAKER_11]: Do they pay it back?

183
00:12:14,928 --> 00:12:17,289
[SPEAKER_11]: Do they continue to make it?

184
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:22,791
[SPEAKER_11]: We have big decisions to make, and this involves people's livelihoods, and I take that extremely seriously.

185
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:26,133
[SPEAKER_11]: As do I, as protector of the records and confidentiality.

186
00:12:27,133 --> 00:12:29,334
[SPEAKER_10]: But these are public records, so it has to be done in public.

187
00:12:29,354 --> 00:12:30,795
[SPEAKER_10]: They are, but a committee of the whole is not.

188
00:12:31,175 --> 00:12:33,176
[SPEAKER_10]: typically televised.

189
00:12:33,736 --> 00:12:41,280
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of these questions, I think, are out of line in nature, but I'm happy to go over these with you independently if that's your choice.

190
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:46,623
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'm requesting and I'm making a motion for this to be sent to a committee of the whole.

191
00:12:46,703 --> 00:12:49,985
[SPEAKER_11]: I need one of my colleagues to second my motion, please.

192
00:12:50,005 --> 00:12:59,470
[SPEAKER_16]: So you're asking for a committee of the whole specifically to handle, for these questions to be addressed?

193
00:13:00,147 --> 00:13:01,968
[SPEAKER_11]: These are just the questions I looked at.

194
00:13:02,468 --> 00:13:03,989
[SPEAKER_11]: These could only be a sampling.

195
00:13:04,009 --> 00:13:06,210
[SPEAKER_11]: There's people that do owe money.

196
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,972
[SPEAKER_11]: There's people's longevity that aren't added here.

197
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:13,437
[SPEAKER_11]: Like there's people, when you figure out their salaries, their longevity is missing from this.

198
00:13:13,697 --> 00:13:15,618
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't know if that's a one-time payment.

199
00:13:15,638 --> 00:13:18,459
[SPEAKER_10]: Longevity is paid differently for each group.

200
00:13:18,479 --> 00:13:25,181
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, see, the collective bargaining agreements have documentation that need to be identified.

201
00:13:25,341 --> 00:13:25,941
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

202
00:13:26,461 --> 00:13:27,962
[SPEAKER_11]: No, that's what I'm saying.

203
00:13:28,582 --> 00:13:31,663
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm saying some people are underpaid, some people are overpaid.

204
00:13:32,043 --> 00:13:37,925
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's a motion on the floor, Mayor Burke, for us to meet as a committee to discuss finances within the next week.

205
00:13:38,605 --> 00:13:42,931
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it involves people's pay and it has to be a priority within this committee.

206
00:13:43,472 --> 00:13:45,936
[SPEAKER_16]: Just another question of clarification.

207
00:13:46,016 --> 00:13:48,500
[SPEAKER_16]: How long would it take you to answer some of these questions?

208
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:51,063
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm just worried that we're going to go a little too fast.

209
00:13:51,604 --> 00:13:54,989
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I'm inclined to second your motion so we can debate it.

210
00:13:55,428 --> 00:13:58,890
[SPEAKER_16]: But I'm just, I wonder, how long would it take you to get this payroll information?

211
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:05,193
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, not seeing the nature of some of these questions, it has to be, you know, it has to be reviewed.

212
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:15,059
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm committed, outside of the building, the next couple of days I have council meeting next evening, so there, my agenda is full at this point as well.

213
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:19,301
[SPEAKER_16]: Could I make a friendly amendment to your resolution before, could we make it in two weeks?

214
00:14:19,701 --> 00:14:20,642
[SPEAKER_16]: One week seems a little quick.

215
00:14:21,307 --> 00:14:21,907
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, it's just that.

216
00:14:21,928 --> 00:14:23,389
[SPEAKER_13]: The chair would call the committee in the fall.

217
00:14:23,949 --> 00:14:25,610
[SPEAKER_16]: The chair will call it at a reasonable time.

218
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:26,991
[SPEAKER_13]: If it's voted on.

219
00:14:27,512 --> 00:14:28,993
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll second.

220
00:14:29,013 --> 00:14:36,438
[SPEAKER_05]: I would just like to add that there are changes that happen through the year with teachers as they get salary increment.

221
00:14:36,578 --> 00:14:37,639
[SPEAKER_05]: There was no teachers highlighted.

222
00:14:37,659 --> 00:14:38,320
[SPEAKER_05]: There was no teachers.

223
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:44,164
[SPEAKER_05]: As people go out on maternity leave or they're not working, that's going to be an adjustment in their salary as well.

224
00:14:44,864 --> 00:14:49,588
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe also that if somebody is being underpaid, they would have identified that with us, quite honestly.

225
00:14:50,268 --> 00:14:50,849
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I would have.

226
00:14:51,941 --> 00:14:54,262
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'll second the motion.

227
00:14:54,642 --> 00:14:56,503
[SPEAKER_11]: Just a point of clarification.

228
00:14:57,003 --> 00:15:00,344
[SPEAKER_11]: If someone's covering for someone else, they get an overtime salary.

229
00:15:00,384 --> 00:15:03,666
[SPEAKER_11]: They can't change someone's base salary if they're a union person.

230
00:15:04,126 --> 00:15:16,871
[SPEAKER_11]: And you can bring someone in at a higher step, but you can't change someone once they're working more than one step or whatever's negotiated through bargaining, collective bargaining.

231
00:15:17,131 --> 00:15:19,712
[SPEAKER_11]: You can't do it for one person and not the whole group.

232
00:15:20,772 --> 00:15:25,056
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's my understanding, and I'm happy to be corrected if that's not correct.

233
00:15:25,076 --> 00:15:33,104
[SPEAKER_05]: What I'm addressing is the fact that there are changes in the yearly salary based on people, if a person goes out on a leave of absence, they're no longer being paid.

234
00:15:33,264 --> 00:15:36,447
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, that could be the money that I think, and I don't know they're out.

235
00:15:36,467 --> 00:15:37,268
[SPEAKER_05]: So there are a lot of things.

236
00:15:37,308 --> 00:15:41,172
[SPEAKER_05]: With teachers, mid-year there are salary increments, and they're not equal.

237
00:15:41,552 --> 00:15:44,495
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people are bumped up two salary increments, some are

238
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:45,676
[SPEAKER_05]: bumped up one.

239
00:15:45,716 --> 00:15:47,057
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're going to have that inequity.

240
00:15:47,297 --> 00:15:47,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

241
00:15:47,597 --> 00:15:48,878
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't do any teachers.

242
00:15:48,978 --> 00:15:49,298
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

243
00:15:49,378 --> 00:15:49,898
[SPEAKER_05]: And I kept it.

244
00:15:49,918 --> 00:15:55,480
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to be proactive on this, but I'm just being clear that there are legitimate reasons why we do have changes.

245
00:15:55,981 --> 00:15:56,181
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

246
00:15:56,221 --> 00:16:05,764
[SPEAKER_11]: But my understanding is that the budget book is presented after the increment step increments have been given.

247
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:07,645
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no.

248
00:16:07,665 --> 00:16:09,286
[SPEAKER_05]: They're given mid year as well.

249
00:16:09,796 --> 00:16:12,298
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, but then everybody would have that increase.

250
00:16:12,318 --> 00:16:13,099
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they would not.

251
00:16:13,599 --> 00:16:17,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Salary increment goes according to the graduate credits they've earned.

252
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:20,884
[SPEAKER_05]: And people submit those twice a year at the beginning of the year.

253
00:16:21,305 --> 00:16:24,387
[SPEAKER_05]: We can budget for those, but then they can submit them mid-year.

254
00:16:24,887 --> 00:16:28,350
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, depending upon the level of credits the person has accrued,

255
00:16:28,878 --> 00:16:30,940
[SPEAKER_05]: they get bumped up, and that's per contract.

256
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,464
[SPEAKER_11]: Beverly, you're talking more teachers than I'm talking, like, secretarial union.

257
00:16:35,564 --> 00:16:36,865
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just being clear with you.

258
00:16:36,885 --> 00:16:39,507
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand that, but if you are looking at teachers, let's be proactive.

259
00:16:39,527 --> 00:16:39,768
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not.

260
00:16:39,808 --> 00:16:41,009
[SPEAKER_11]: I've said that three times.

261
00:16:41,229 --> 00:16:41,849
[SPEAKER_05]: I did not.

262
00:16:41,869 --> 00:16:46,513
[SPEAKER_11]: I did not look at teachers, and that's not what I'm questioning.

263
00:16:46,774 --> 00:16:53,940
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not what's highlighted, and I would like to keep it focused on what I brought forward and not distract from that.

264
00:16:54,397 --> 00:16:58,959
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would like to see if one of my members would please second this.

265
00:16:58,979 --> 00:17:00,460
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Ruggiero seconded your motion.

266
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,341
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, I didn't hear him.

267
00:17:01,361 --> 00:17:01,681
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.

268
00:17:01,701 --> 00:17:01,781
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

269
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:02,281
[SPEAKER_22]: Van de Kloof.

270
00:17:03,021 --> 00:17:09,645
[SPEAKER_22]: So, you know, I don't have any problem with having a committee of the whole to discuss the payroll questions.

271
00:17:10,005 --> 00:17:14,527
[SPEAKER_22]: I do have a huge problem with the feeling that

272
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:19,831
[SPEAKER_22]: some wrongdoing, the charge of wrongdoing.

273
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:27,278
[SPEAKER_22]: So let's, just going to be very clear, I'm going to vote for the meeting because I think it's always appropriate for us to ask questions.

274
00:17:27,678 --> 00:17:37,167
[SPEAKER_22]: But I'm not, there's, I'm going with an open mind to hear explanations, which I believe will be reasonable explanations.

275
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,542
[SPEAKER_22]: and have always been in my, when I've gone and asked specific questions.

276
00:17:42,723 --> 00:17:45,385
[SPEAKER_22]: But having a committee of the whole is, it's no big deal.

277
00:17:45,645 --> 00:17:52,109
[SPEAKER_22]: Why, why not spend yet another night together?

278
00:17:52,129 --> 00:17:52,529
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Ruggiero.

279
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:57,712
[SPEAKER_16]: I just have some questions for you cause you know, I'm concerned if there are issues.

280
00:17:58,293 --> 00:18:03,756
[SPEAKER_16]: It's okay if we, if this is not the appropriate time for these questions, I just trying to get my head around all of this.

281
00:18:04,456 --> 00:18:04,597
[SPEAKER_16]: So,

282
00:18:05,979 --> 00:18:12,264
[SPEAKER_16]: If the administration raises a base salary that's not a step increase, the school committee is notified.

283
00:18:12,304 --> 00:18:12,905
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that correct?

284
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:13,886
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

285
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:14,706
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

286
00:18:14,946 --> 00:18:17,268
[SPEAKER_16]: So the base can go up or down.

287
00:18:17,769 --> 00:18:18,829
[SPEAKER_16]: We're not notified of those?

288
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:22,172
[SPEAKER_10]: On a daily basis, no.

289
00:18:22,192 --> 00:18:26,996
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got hundreds of status changes that occur during the course of a year.

290
00:18:27,476 --> 00:18:28,998
[SPEAKER_10]: So everything is documented.

291
00:18:29,378 --> 00:18:32,541
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's no issue with that.

292
00:18:33,301 --> 00:18:35,563
[SPEAKER_10]: And I can safely attest that

293
00:18:35,987 --> 00:18:43,771
[SPEAKER_10]: overtime does not go into a base salary and is not adjusted upward in any type of percentage.

294
00:18:44,132 --> 00:19:04,023
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's some inaccurate information here, and I think it's important that the collective bargaining agreements be reviewed and be understood by those that are going to be reviewing and questioning some of the payroll items, because these are followed in conjunction with those CBA documents and individual contracts as they are established.

295
00:19:05,268 --> 00:19:14,576
[SPEAKER_10]: In terms of non-unit employees, the COLA blended rate was the 2.5%, and that was established during the budget process last year.

296
00:19:14,956 --> 00:19:18,098
[SPEAKER_10]: So are things done during the course of the year?

297
00:19:18,339 --> 00:19:21,881
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, they are documented throughout, and the changes are recorded.

298
00:19:22,262 --> 00:19:24,964
[SPEAKER_10]: There are many different implications between

299
00:19:25,425 --> 00:19:29,308
[SPEAKER_10]: what is considered eligible and ineligible for retirement purposes.

300
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:40,756
[SPEAKER_10]: All of those items are being addressed and being monitored very closely and being reviewed very accurately at this point for a limited staffing that we have.

301
00:19:41,878 --> 00:19:51,904
[SPEAKER_16]: Could you send us copies before the meeting of the digital, I have the digital teacher's contract, but it would be nice to have the other collective bargaining contracts.

302
00:19:52,044 --> 00:19:56,626
[SPEAKER_16]: If you could send that to all of us, that would be useful so I could review the information in advance.

303
00:19:58,747 --> 00:20:02,870
[SPEAKER_16]: And so every contract has different rules for step increases.

304
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:03,430
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that correct?

305
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:04,151
[SPEAKER_13]: They negotiate it.

306
00:20:04,171 --> 00:20:04,491
[SPEAKER_16]: Correct.

307
00:20:04,631 --> 00:20:06,412
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, so I see.

308
00:20:06,432 --> 00:20:10,895
[SPEAKER_13]: You could be a January 1st increase, in which case you're looking at a payroll dated March.

309
00:20:11,035 --> 00:20:11,215
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

310
00:20:11,696 --> 00:20:15,898
[SPEAKER_13]: You're projecting it for 52 weeks when the raise may have taken place January 1st.

311
00:20:15,918 --> 00:20:17,279
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's only a six month increase.

312
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:21,542
[SPEAKER_13]: So without having all the backup, you can't say that something is wrong.

313
00:20:21,922 --> 00:20:22,403
[SPEAKER_16]: Right, of course.

314
00:20:23,363 --> 00:20:30,026
[SPEAKER_16]: And so you can have multiple step increases at once or would it just be one step at a time?

315
00:20:30,106 --> 00:20:32,667
[SPEAKER_16]: Like every year you would get no more than one step increase?

316
00:20:33,127 --> 00:20:39,029
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, it's dependent on the collective bargaining agreement and what might have qualified for the step and or a status change.

317
00:20:39,429 --> 00:20:43,510
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, with the teachers if they have additional degrees, yes.

318
00:20:43,751 --> 00:20:45,291
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's a number of factors.

319
00:20:46,051 --> 00:20:47,052
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, that's all my questions.

320
00:20:47,072 --> 00:20:47,332
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

321
00:20:48,224 --> 00:20:54,325
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a motion on the floor to send this paper to the Committee of the Whole, seconded by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Mr. Ruggiero.

322
00:20:55,646 --> 00:20:56,506

[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

[SPEAKER_13]: So keep these documents.

327
00:21:04,368 --> 00:21:07,809
[SPEAKER_13]: We will not ask them to spurnish them to us again, so keep your papers.

328
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:13,210
[SPEAKER_13]: And the payrolls are tabled.

329
00:21:15,544 --> 00:21:22,207
Approval of perils.

[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_13]: 7 in the affirmative 0 in the negative motion passes report of secretary, miss Chris to share with everybody.

342
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:50,965
[SPEAKER_14]: So far this month, I signed up on typical invoices related to heating, electricity, pupil transportation.

343
00:21:51,506 --> 00:21:53,888
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, there was an invoice for an elevator repair.

344
00:21:54,648 --> 00:21:59,212
[SPEAKER_14]: Also in the first week of March, I signed an invoice for prospect building services.

345
00:22:00,007 --> 00:22:02,588
[SPEAKER_14]: The total combined of all the mini vouchers was $35,704.48.

346
00:22:03,468 --> 00:22:11,649
[SPEAKER_14]: And what Prospect did was they performed a disinfecting mist spray at all of the schools in February.

347
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:25,852
[SPEAKER_14]: The cleaning also included the high school pool was cleaned, the culinary arts department machines were degreased and scrubbed, and the cosmetology was mopped, washed, buffed, and stripped, and refinished the tile floor.

348
00:22:25,872 --> 00:22:28,513
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought it was interesting, so I wanted to share with everybody.

349
00:22:30,151 --> 00:22:30,592
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Ms.

[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a motion by Ms.

00:22:35,794 --> 00:22:36,274

00:22:36,394 --> 00:22:36,995
[SPEAKER_13]: Seconded by Ms.

[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

360
00:22:41,797 --> 00:22:42,878
[SPEAKER_13]: Report of committees.

361
00:22:42,998 --> 00:22:43,758
[SPEAKER_13]: Rules committee.

362
00:22:43,858 --> 00:22:44,138
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

363
00:22:44,378 --> 00:22:44,898
[SPEAKER_13]: Report.

364
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:45,699
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

365
00:22:45,939 --> 00:22:47,560
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's February 26th, 2018.

366
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,000
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

367
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:48,960
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

368
00:22:49,021 --> 00:22:56,064
[SPEAKER_14]: So I have a report and so I'm the chairperson on the rules subcommittee.

369
00:22:56,752 --> 00:23:01,595
[SPEAKER_14]: And we met on February 26 in the superintendent's conference room at Medford High School.

370
00:23:02,076 --> 00:23:10,281
[SPEAKER_14]: The purpose of the meeting was to review the revised proposed reporting requirements for PTO, PTG, Friends of organizations.

371
00:23:10,762 --> 00:23:10,942
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

372
00:23:10,962 --> 00:23:26,172
[SPEAKER_14]: Jenny Graham, who's here tonight, was instrumental in helping the committee create a softer online version of the oversight guidelines for PTO, PTG, and other internal 501c3 organizations, other organizations that support our public schools.

373
00:23:26,862 --> 00:23:35,944
[SPEAKER_14]: In your packets, please be advised that this evening, everybody got revised copies of the guidelines and they were left on your desk this evening.

374
00:23:35,984 --> 00:23:38,204
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you could just be mindful of that.

375
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:40,485
[SPEAKER_14]: There was a couple of typographical errors.

376
00:23:40,965 --> 00:23:46,986
[SPEAKER_14]: There was multiple versions of the copies and accidentally, I think, you know, the wrong one got printed in the packet.

377
00:23:47,326 --> 00:23:49,166
[SPEAKER_14]: So just, you know, be on the lookout for that.

378
00:23:50,566 --> 00:23:53,547
[SPEAKER_14]: And what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna read briefly the objective

379
00:23:53,973 --> 00:23:57,774
[SPEAKER_14]: The document is rather long, but it's very detailed.

380
00:23:57,834 --> 00:23:58,474
[SPEAKER_14]: It's excellent.

381
00:23:58,534 --> 00:24:02,435
[SPEAKER_14]: If anybody has any questions afterwards, I'll be happy to go over any questions.

382
00:24:02,815 --> 00:24:05,456
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm going to read the objectives, and then I'm going to invite Ms.

383
00:24:05,476 --> 00:24:08,917
[SPEAKER_14]: Graham up to show everybody a demonstration of the online form.

384
00:24:10,577 --> 00:24:22,400
[SPEAKER_14]: OK, so the objective of the PTO-PTG guidelines is the school committee recognizes that there are a significant number of organizations that operate within

385
00:24:22,813 --> 00:24:28,216
[SPEAKER_14]: Medford to augment and supplement the educational and extracurricular experiences of our students.

386
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:36,061
[SPEAKER_14]: These PTO, PTG, other 501C3 organizations will be referred to as organizations throughout the document.

387
00:24:36,781 --> 00:24:46,227
[SPEAKER_14]: The committee appreciates the hard work and the dedication of the organization of volunteers and wishes to foster an environment of collaboration and shared vision.

388
00:24:46,747 --> 00:24:51,010
[SPEAKER_14]: To do that, it's important that the committee understands the number of organizations

389
00:24:51,422 --> 00:24:55,124
[SPEAKER_14]: in the goals of each operating to the benefit of the Medford Public Schools.

390
00:24:55,705 --> 00:25:09,113
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not the goal of the committee to centralize, stifle the efforts of the independent entities, many of which are 501c3 registered entities, but rather support their efforts through transparency and collaboration.

391
00:25:09,953 --> 00:25:16,037
[SPEAKER_14]: And you'll notice that there's a section on organization identification, which includes the online form.

392
00:25:16,617 --> 00:25:19,299
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a section on the bylaws,

393
00:25:20,295 --> 00:25:25,179
[SPEAKER_14]: which has some best practice information in it, and it's detailed.

394
00:25:25,579 --> 00:25:28,341
[SPEAKER_14]: There's information about fundraising and expenditures.

395
00:25:29,282 --> 00:25:31,424
[SPEAKER_14]: Training is offered and available.

396
00:25:31,944 --> 00:25:36,367
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not gonna be required, but it will be offered and strongly recommended when needed.

397
00:25:36,387 --> 00:25:42,772
[SPEAKER_14]: There's also going to be an annual update, and there's compliance with the policy.

398
00:25:44,032 --> 00:25:46,353
[SPEAKER_14]: So at this time, I'd like to invite Ms.

399
00:25:46,373 --> 00:25:47,074
[SPEAKER_14]: Jenny Graham up.

400
00:25:47,434 --> 00:25:50,396
[SPEAKER_14]: And she's been extremely instrumental.

401
00:25:50,476 --> 00:25:52,817
[SPEAKER_14]: And she's just been a great help and amazing.

402
00:25:53,437 --> 00:25:55,519
[SPEAKER_14]: And she's going to demonstrate the online form.

403
00:25:55,539 --> 00:25:58,740
[SPEAKER_14]: And you'll get to see how easy and user-friendly it is.

404
00:25:59,161 --> 00:25:59,781
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Jenny.

405
00:26:00,361 --> 00:26:01,102
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Benedetto?

406
00:26:02,217 --> 00:26:03,818
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to thank my colleague.

407
00:26:03,838 --> 00:26:04,658
[SPEAKER_11]: This is great.

408
00:26:04,999 --> 00:26:06,239
[SPEAKER_11]: This is really, really nice.

409
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:07,880
[SPEAKER_11]: I wanted to start with that.

410
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:10,082
[SPEAKER_11]: I just had a few questions.

411
00:26:10,222 --> 00:26:18,046
[SPEAKER_11]: Are all groups now registered with the school department or will be by April 1st, like the friends of and BTOs?

412
00:26:18,587 --> 00:26:20,548
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not going to be this April 1st.

413
00:26:20,828 --> 00:26:24,110
[SPEAKER_14]: So what we're doing is tonight, we are reviewing the guidelines.

414
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:25,671
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what we're making a decision on tonight.

415
00:26:25,711 --> 00:26:26,972
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to review the guidelines.

416
00:26:27,332 --> 00:26:28,793
[SPEAKER_14]: You're going to see the online form.

417
00:26:29,348 --> 00:26:36,729
[SPEAKER_14]: And then I'm going to hopefully make a motion to accept the guidelines, the online form, so that we can roll it out.

418
00:26:36,869 --> 00:26:38,310
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to have it put on the website.

419
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:40,370
[SPEAKER_14]: I already got in touch with Superintendent Belson.

420
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:51,772
[SPEAKER_14]: So once we approve this, he's going to get in touch with the people who can put it on the website so that we can start collecting the information so that we'll have all the registered groups by October 1, 2018.

421
00:26:53,172 --> 00:26:58,633
[SPEAKER_14]: Because they're going to have from now until October to get registered, because this is a new process.

422
00:26:59,574 --> 00:27:03,437
[SPEAKER_11]: And my follow-up question is about the compliancy policy I read.

423
00:27:04,677 --> 00:27:10,541
[SPEAKER_11]: So the only, like if someone doesn't register from us, they just can't use the school name.

424
00:27:10,801 --> 00:27:22,588
[SPEAKER_11]: They can be, they'll just no longer be affiliated with us, but they can still run and raise money under a different name, just not like the friends of type thing.

425
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,918
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I just wanted to be clear on that.

426
00:27:25,219 --> 00:27:26,419
[SPEAKER_11]: I really, I like this.

427
00:27:26,459 --> 00:27:29,680
[SPEAKER_11]: This is really, really good work to all involved.

428
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:30,360
[SPEAKER_11]: Very.

429
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,720
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank Jenny and Paul and Mike.

430
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,421
[SPEAKER_11]: Excellent work.

431
00:27:33,801 --> 00:27:36,661
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for bringing it forward in your time on that.

432
00:27:37,402 --> 00:27:38,442
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm happy to.

433
00:27:39,302 --> 00:27:42,363
[SPEAKER_21]: Can somebody hand me the remote?

434
00:27:44,223 --> 00:27:46,484
[SPEAKER_21]: I feel like we're missing just some sort of power here.

435
00:27:47,304 --> 00:27:48,644
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah, we did have it on earlier.

436
00:27:48,664 --> 00:27:51,245
[SPEAKER_11]: It might take a minute to warm up now.

437
00:27:55,522 --> 00:27:58,703
[SPEAKER_21]: I still see it flashing, so I'm not sure what that means.

438
00:28:04,686 --> 00:28:15,111
[SPEAKER_21]: There we go.

439
00:28:15,411 --> 00:28:19,433
[SPEAKER_21]: If you can kill at least one of those lights, it might be a little bit easier for people to see.

440
00:28:30,776 --> 00:28:31,036
[SPEAKER_11]: It is.

441
00:28:31,056 --> 00:28:32,417
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought we should have movies.

442
00:28:35,139 --> 00:28:40,123
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we go.

443
00:28:40,384 --> 00:28:40,624
[SPEAKER_21]: OK.

444
00:28:41,644 --> 00:28:54,915
[SPEAKER_21]: So as we talked about putting this form together, one of the things that I was concerned about as a member of the PTO was making sure that whatever we put together is really

445
00:28:55,535 --> 00:28:59,157
[SPEAKER_21]: simple and streamlined for the people who were asking to do this.

446
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:16,468
[SPEAKER_21]: So in the spirit of fostering collaboration between all of these groups that work so hard and the central office and the school committee, I felt like it was really important to be able to say to folks, this is what it looks like and this is what we need from you.

447
00:29:16,568 --> 00:29:19,030
[SPEAKER_21]: And really to be able to demonstrate how easy it is.

448
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:35,663
[SPEAKER_21]: Largely, what you see here is just the beginning of the Google form, and it's exactly what Kathy just read to you, so that there's a link between what this form says in its intent and the actual policy, which will undoubtedly go somewhere else.

449
00:29:35,803 --> 00:29:39,746
[SPEAKER_21]: But as you fill this out, we don't want people to forget over time exactly what we're trying to do.

450
00:29:44,243 --> 00:29:49,347
[SPEAKER_21]: So the vision is that each year, the organizations would provide this information.

451
00:29:49,367 --> 00:29:53,550
[SPEAKER_21]: Anything you see that has an asterisk next to it is required.

452
00:29:54,690 --> 00:30:08,099
[SPEAKER_21]: There are things that are required by the end of the year, but they're not listed as things that are required in the form because the vision is that this form will be used at multiple steps across the year to be able to give information.

453
00:30:08,199 --> 00:30:12,122
[SPEAKER_21]: So up front, when you first put this information together,

454
00:30:12,753 --> 00:30:14,975
[SPEAKER_21]: just some basic information about the organization.

455
00:30:15,055 --> 00:30:15,796
[SPEAKER_21]: So who are you?

456
00:30:15,916 --> 00:30:16,897
[SPEAKER_21]: What is your purpose?

457
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:18,579
[SPEAKER_21]: What's your mission and vision?

458
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:19,961
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you have a website?

459
00:30:20,081 --> 00:30:21,562
[SPEAKER_21]: Are you a 501C3?

460
00:30:21,802 --> 00:30:23,464
[SPEAKER_21]: So just really very simple.

461
00:30:24,946 --> 00:30:29,971
[SPEAKER_21]: We also put in a place for the MPS staff liaison.

462
00:30:30,071 --> 00:30:31,152
[SPEAKER_21]: So whoever is your

463
00:30:32,073 --> 00:30:45,826
[SPEAKER_21]: either your building principal or your band advisor or whoever that person is that is your connection point to MPS would be listed here, as well as some sort of primary email for the organization.

464
00:30:47,481 --> 00:31:02,030
[SPEAKER_21]: Anything that's got a parentheses stating public, the vision is that those fields would be made available on a larger list so that the community could go out to the NPS website, they could see who all of these organizations are and there'd be some way to contact them.

465
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:05,892
[SPEAKER_21]: So there'd be some aggregation of some of the information in these forms.

466
00:31:07,701 --> 00:31:12,082
[SPEAKER_21]: Then we talk a little bit about the organization specifically, so fiscal year end.

467
00:31:12,222 --> 00:31:18,063
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's really so that the superintendent's office has some track of the fiscal year end.

468
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:20,304
[SPEAKER_21]: I would assume that most would be June 30th.

469
00:31:21,124 --> 00:31:27,425
[SPEAKER_21]: But in the event that there's something different out there, they shouldn't be looking for financial documents if the year end has not come and gone yet.

470
00:31:28,246 --> 00:31:30,446
[SPEAKER_21]: And then Kathy referenced training.

471
00:31:30,586 --> 00:31:33,887
[SPEAKER_21]: And one of the things that we talked about as being really important is

472
00:31:34,968 --> 00:31:40,295
[SPEAKER_21]: providing some sort of support for folks who may want to take on a role as treasurer.

473
00:31:40,835 --> 00:31:46,142
[SPEAKER_21]: In particular, if you're a 501c3, there's real legal requirements associated with that.

474
00:31:46,202 --> 00:31:50,907
[SPEAKER_21]: So even if you're good with numbers, it may not mean that you are equipped to be a treasurer.

475
00:31:51,568 --> 00:32:05,474
[SPEAKER_21]: So this field allows the superintendent's office to know, I've already been trained by the superintendent's office, or I don't need to be trained because I am, in fact, a professional in this field, and I know everything I need to know about doing this correctly.

476
00:32:06,574 --> 00:32:09,155
[SPEAKER_21]: Or, in fact, I do need training.

477
00:32:09,215 --> 00:32:17,879
[SPEAKER_21]: So that will allow the superintendent's office or whoever ultimately does this training to be able to say, OK, these are the five people for this year who need this training.

478
00:32:21,156 --> 00:32:24,257
[SPEAKER_21]: When you flip forward, oh, I guess I have to answer these.

479
00:32:26,237 --> 00:32:40,861
[SPEAKER_14]: Very smart.

480
00:32:40,901 --> 00:32:47,663
[SPEAKER_21]: So you can see, especially if you're somebody who has a website, a lot of this information would be available there anyway.

481
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:52,406
[SPEAKER_21]: and it shouldn't take but a few seconds to fill this out.

482
00:32:57,174 --> 00:32:58,356
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, now we're ready to go.

483
00:33:01,375 --> 00:33:05,677
[SPEAKER_21]: So then here you would be saying, OK, so for this school year, what am I telling you about?

484
00:33:05,857 --> 00:33:10,718
[SPEAKER_21]: And you'd go through and you'd say, this is for the current school year, for example.

485
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:20,822
[SPEAKER_21]: There would be an opportunity for you to say, yes, I already have provided the superintendent's office a copy of my bylaws, because that's part of the policy.

486
00:33:22,022 --> 00:33:23,723
[SPEAKER_21]: Or there are updates that are needed.

487
00:33:23,743 --> 00:33:30,525
[SPEAKER_21]: So if I say that there are updates needed, I can actually just go ahead and add it right here, snap it in there, and then it's ready to go.

488
00:33:32,599 --> 00:33:55,425
[SPEAKER_21]: If you scroll down just a little bit, there is some information here about your elected officials, so name, title, email address, and phone number, with a caveat that only the names would be listed on the public listing and that that central mailbox would be listed as the contact information for the organization so that we're not kind of publicizing personal emails and phone numbers of the folks who are working on these committees.

489
00:34:04,738 --> 00:34:06,079
[SPEAKER_21]: It's too smart even for me.

490
00:34:08,121 --> 00:34:15,467
[SPEAKER_21]: A couple of other things that we identified that would be important to know from a transparency perspective, does the organization carry insurance?

491
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:17,789
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes or no?

492
00:34:18,309 --> 00:34:23,073
[SPEAKER_21]: And if so, what kind of insurance is it that the organization carries?

493
00:34:25,114 --> 00:34:30,118
[SPEAKER_21]: And then as you go forward, there's space for the financials to be uploaded.

494
00:34:31,524 --> 00:34:37,486
[SPEAKER_21]: whatever your approved budget is can be uploaded, your end of year financials, and any regulatory filings can be updated.

495
00:34:38,706 --> 00:34:45,268
[SPEAKER_21]: So you submit this, the information goes to a central drive, and that would reside wherever you guys decide to put that.

496
00:34:45,829 --> 00:34:50,690
[SPEAKER_21]: And then if I needed to go back, I could go back and edit my response to add those other documents as they come through.

497
00:34:50,830 --> 00:35:00,093
[SPEAKER_21]: So really simple, everything in one place, really intended not to be burdensome, but provide a level of transparency so that you all know

498
00:35:00,711 --> 00:35:05,995
[SPEAKER_21]: exactly what is happening in the organizations from a fiscal and from a reporting perspective.

499
00:35:06,656 --> 00:35:08,978
[SPEAKER_14]: Excellent.

500
00:35:09,098 --> 00:35:09,518
[SPEAKER_14]: It's great.

501
00:35:09,699 --> 00:35:11,540
[SPEAKER_14]: It's really, it's so easy to use.

502
00:35:12,781 --> 00:35:13,602
[SPEAKER_22]: Ms.

503
00:35:13,622 --> 00:35:14,102
[SPEAKER_13]: Van De Kloot.

504
00:35:14,983 --> 00:35:16,064
[SPEAKER_22]: It's just great, Jenny.

505
00:35:16,104 --> 00:35:17,825
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you for all your work and the work, Kathy.

506
00:35:17,845 --> 00:35:18,886
[SPEAKER_22]: You're welcome.

507
00:35:19,006 --> 00:35:21,809
[SPEAKER_22]: That's easy to use.

508
00:35:22,049 --> 00:35:29,535
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm thinking, of course, just that it just makes things so clear and it's great work.

509
00:35:29,895 --> 00:35:30,175
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks.

510
00:35:30,535 --> 00:35:30,996
[SPEAKER_22]: Thanks.

511
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:32,276
[SPEAKER_13]: Maver.

512
00:35:32,957 --> 00:35:33,617
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Benedetto.

513
00:35:33,957 --> 00:35:36,398
[SPEAKER_11]: Are the financials a requirement?

514
00:35:36,678 --> 00:35:38,799
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't see the asterisk next to that section.

515
00:35:38,959 --> 00:35:39,160
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

516
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,441
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that something that's being part of the policy?

517
00:35:42,081 --> 00:35:43,682
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe, Kathy?

518
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:45,042
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

519
00:35:45,103 --> 00:35:46,243
[SPEAKER_21]: So they are required.

520
00:35:46,283 --> 00:35:51,706
[SPEAKER_21]: You just can't, if we require it on the form, you'd be required to attach something when you fill out the form.

521
00:35:51,826 --> 00:35:56,068
[SPEAKER_21]: And the vision is that that demographic information would be filled out at the start of the year.

522
00:35:56,578 --> 00:35:59,740
[SPEAKER_21]: And the financials for that year wouldn't be available till almost a year later.

523
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:03,563
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's just that the forum isn't that smart and can't do that.

524
00:36:03,683 --> 00:36:16,893
[SPEAKER_21]: But the goal would be that whoever is responsible for making sure this information is coming in, if they're not seeing it 60 days after that fiscal year end that's listed there, that they'd be able to reach out and say, hey, where are your filings?

525
00:36:16,993 --> 00:36:17,794
[SPEAKER_21]: They're not uploaded.

526
00:36:18,614 --> 00:36:20,796
[SPEAKER_11]: And that brought up a good second question.

527
00:36:20,856 --> 00:36:23,518
[SPEAKER_11]: This is going to the superintendent's office.

528
00:36:23,538 --> 00:36:25,980
[SPEAKER_11]: So do we have someone there that's going to be

529
00:36:27,204 --> 00:36:31,446
[SPEAKER_11]: making sure that all the groups are registered and that this is followed through.

530
00:36:31,466 --> 00:36:34,287
[SPEAKER_11]: It seems like an extra task for someone in that department.

531
00:36:35,828 --> 00:36:43,311
[SPEAKER_11]: So maybe that's something that we need to think about and bring forward and talk about in some way.

532
00:36:43,391 --> 00:36:54,376
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe we can, maybe the superintendent's office will, maybe Deputy Superintendent Nelson can advise us to

533
00:36:55,812 --> 00:37:04,561
[SPEAKER_11]: in the future give us a report on who would be in charge of monitoring this information and bringing it forward and like just keeping it.

534
00:37:06,203 --> 00:37:06,503
[SPEAKER_11]: I get it.

535
00:37:10,507 --> 00:37:10,848
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

536
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:14,683
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

537
00:37:14,703 --> 00:37:20,546
[SPEAKER_13]: Nelson, I think the question is to someone in the office that could monitor and maintain this list.

538
00:37:20,606 --> 00:37:22,327
[SPEAKER_05]: We certainly will do that.

539
00:37:22,547 --> 00:37:25,409
[SPEAKER_05]: I just, we have to identify someone who will obviously be in charge of that.

540
00:37:25,429 --> 00:37:27,690
[SPEAKER_14]: It just seems like a lot of work for someone else to take on.

541
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:28,050
[SPEAKER_14]: It is.

542
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:28,410
[SPEAKER_11]: It is.

543
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:35,634
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just wanted to be aware to you and maybe you could provide us a report by October 1st, like who's going to be the responsible person.

544
00:37:35,714 --> 00:37:38,455
[SPEAKER_13]: Or by budget time because it may be a stipend or something.

545
00:37:38,475 --> 00:37:38,715
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

546
00:37:38,755 --> 00:37:39,176
[SPEAKER_13]: Part time.

547
00:37:39,516 --> 00:37:39,596
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep.

548
00:37:39,976 --> 00:37:41,958
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so we'll definitely consider that.

549
00:37:42,578 --> 00:37:47,181
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll put it on my thing to the back of our agenda list as a report.

550
00:37:47,361 --> 00:37:53,546
[SPEAKER_11]: So that way there, we remember to make, remind you that it, you know, we'll help each other remember.

551
00:37:55,067 --> 00:38:03,573
[SPEAKER_11]: So we are, I'm requesting a report as to who and how we're going to allocate this additional work to.

552
00:38:08,114 --> 00:38:09,075
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice job to the committee.

553
00:38:09,235 --> 00:38:09,755
[SPEAKER_13]: Great job.

554
00:38:09,775 --> 00:38:10,395
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you so much.

555
00:38:11,176 --> 00:38:11,576
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

556
00:38:12,216 --> 00:38:18,699
[SPEAKER_21]: And I know that there, I think we're planning for this to go into implementation next year, right?

557
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:28,824
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, if there's any interest in a group to volunteer to go first to do the presentation to you guys, the Brooks PTO would be excited to do that sometime later this year.

558
00:38:29,464 --> 00:38:30,525
[SPEAKER_21]: So we would be happy to,

559
00:38:31,203 --> 00:38:34,588
[SPEAKER_21]: put together what we want to tell you and bring it to the meeting.

560
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:43,140
[SPEAKER_21]: If there's room on the schedule for that, we'd be happy to do that just to give people a sense of what that would look like and that it's not that scary.

561
00:38:47,272 --> 00:38:48,333
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

562
00:38:48,353 --> 00:38:49,814
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

563
00:38:49,854 --> 00:38:51,155
[SPEAKER_14]: Kritz, you wanted to make a motion?

564
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:52,316
[SPEAKER_14]: Very good.

565
00:38:52,356 --> 00:38:57,619
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a motion on the floor to accept this policy, seconded by Ms.

566
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:58,340
[SPEAKER_14]: Vander Kloot.

567
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,241
[SPEAKER_14]: Roll call vote.

568
00:39:16,806 --> 00:39:17,166
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

569
00:39:20,387 --> 00:39:25,248
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

570
00:39:25,288 --> 00:39:28,108
[SPEAKER_13]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative motion passes.

571
00:39:28,709 --> 00:39:36,530
[SPEAKER_13]: And also Mr. Benedetto's, uh, report to find out who would be doing, keeping up with this inventory of organizations.

572
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:40,191
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a second on the floor for Mr. Russo?

573
00:39:40,891 --> 00:39:41,651
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor.

574
00:39:42,371 --> 00:39:42,932
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed.

575
00:39:42,992 --> 00:39:43,652
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

576
00:39:44,452 --> 00:39:45,092
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much.

577
00:39:49,213 --> 00:39:50,433
[SPEAKER_13]: Community participation.

578
00:39:50,493 --> 00:39:52,514
[SPEAKER_13]: There is nothing on the agenda for this evening.

579
00:39:55,055 --> 00:39:55,855
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Ruggiero.

580
00:40:04,658 --> 00:40:08,860
[SPEAKER_13]: So motion on the floor for suspension of the rules to take paper on the library out of order.

581
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,660
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a second?

582
00:40:11,921 --> 00:40:13,802
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion to take this paper out of order.

583
00:40:13,822 --> 00:40:14,502
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

584
00:40:15,202 --> 00:40:15,922
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

585
00:40:16,463 --> 00:40:17,103
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion granted.

586
00:40:21,431 --> 00:40:29,097
[SPEAKER_13]: Recommendations submitted by member Michael Ruggiero that the Medford School Committee go on record in support of the following project and any loan order associated with said project.

587
00:40:29,837 --> 00:40:45,649
[SPEAKER_13]: Whereas a functioning library is an essential institution to the education of an entire community, and whereas the $12.3 million grant from the Mass Board of Library Commissioners, which has been acquired to finance the construction of a new library, will expire on April 10th, and an additional green library incentive of $430,000,

588
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:53,571
[SPEAKER_13]: Now the FOB has resolved that the School Committee of Medford go on record in support of this project and any law and order associated with said project.

589
00:40:53,611 --> 00:40:59,692
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Ruggiero.

590
00:40:59,712 --> 00:41:01,213
[SPEAKER_16]: 44,954 children's and young adult books.

591
00:41:01,653 --> 00:41:02,833
[SPEAKER_16]: A mountain of material.

592
00:41:03,433 --> 00:41:07,594
[SPEAKER_16]: But only one small part of what our library provides to the children of Medford.

593
00:41:08,274 --> 00:41:13,115
[SPEAKER_16]: Beyond these books, or CDs, or DVDs, or curriculum support,

594
00:41:13,676 --> 00:41:24,344
[SPEAKER_16]: hundreds of story time hours and tutoring sessions, the most important parts of our city library are the safe halls sheltering the students of our schools.

595
00:41:25,284 --> 00:41:27,086
[SPEAKER_16]: We have all seen the pictures.

596
00:41:27,846 --> 00:41:32,850
[SPEAKER_16]: We need a library without a leaking roof or rotting floors or flickering lights.

597
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:41,156
[SPEAKER_16]: And it is for this reason that I ask you to request that the city council approve the construction of a new space.

598
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:52,202
[SPEAKER_16]: A place where children can not only study for the MCAS, but also a space where WIM can take a child to the dialogues of Plato or the history of DNA.

599
00:41:52,642 --> 00:41:52,862
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

600
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:59,985
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's build a new dry home for the greatest minds and a place for children to wander amongst them.

601
00:42:01,385 --> 00:42:03,966
[SPEAKER_16]: A few members wish to speak on this resolution.

602
00:42:03,986 --> 00:42:06,447
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd like to invite them to speak.

603
00:42:07,507 --> 00:42:08,747
[SPEAKER_16]: And if anyone has any questions.

604
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:09,988
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Brousseau, do you yield?

605
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:10,628
[SPEAKER_13]: Would you like to speak?

606
00:42:11,642 --> 00:42:12,523
[SPEAKER_13]: You don't want to speak, okay.

607
00:42:14,024 --> 00:42:14,324
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

608
00:42:14,344 --> 00:42:15,645
[SPEAKER_13]: Your name and address for the record, please.

609
00:42:16,405 --> 00:42:17,366
[SPEAKER_17]: My name's Jessica Farrell.

610
00:42:17,386 --> 00:42:19,027
[SPEAKER_17]: My address is 29 Martin Street.

611
00:42:21,449 --> 00:42:22,130
[SPEAKER_17]: I agree.

612
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:24,992
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you so much for bringing up the resolution, Michael.

613
00:42:25,792 --> 00:42:28,694
[SPEAKER_17]: I just wanted to come up and speak in support of this resolution.

614
00:42:29,923 --> 00:42:36,365
[SPEAKER_17]: Obviously, the library, I think, provides some educational support for people of all ages, not just through the K-12 system.

615
00:42:36,425 --> 00:42:38,765
[SPEAKER_17]: They are open for hours that are different from the schools.

616
00:42:39,806 --> 00:42:48,468
[SPEAKER_17]: They provide meeting spaces and community spaces for the rest of us that maybe aren't in the K-12 system but need the library for other reasons as well.

617
00:42:49,288 --> 00:42:55,790
[SPEAKER_17]: These days, librarians deal with a lot of issues that a lot of people would be surprised about, some more like social work issues.

618
00:42:55,830 --> 00:42:57,651
[SPEAKER_17]: They're helping people apply to jobs.

619
00:42:57,691 --> 00:42:58,431
[SPEAKER_17]: They're helping people

620
00:42:59,219 --> 00:43:07,222
[SPEAKER_17]: access information, get through the crazy bureaucracies that we have to get through every day to live our lives, and some people just really need a lot more support for that.

621
00:43:07,582 --> 00:43:16,225
[SPEAKER_17]: And so I think that the library is one of our foundations of community support, especially where people can't get that support from others in their daily lives.

622
00:43:17,525 --> 00:43:24,568
[SPEAKER_17]: I think when libraries and the librarians that work in them have to deal with structural issues, they can't focus on those really important jobs that they have to

623
00:43:25,078 --> 00:43:28,221
[SPEAKER_17]: do the things that are great for our community and increase their programming.

624
00:43:28,802 --> 00:43:36,510
[SPEAKER_17]: And I know as a librarian myself, not here in Medford, but elsewhere, that we always have a million more ideas than the resources to actually put them through.

625
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:40,435
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm sure that everyone that works at a library has a million ideas for things that they'd like to do.

626
00:43:41,175 --> 00:43:46,922
[SPEAKER_17]: Having a sound structure is just like the most basic thing to realizing those potentials.

627
00:43:47,887 --> 00:43:54,250
[SPEAKER_17]: I also think that as far as funding goes, there's been a lot of discussion about the funding for the library.

628
00:43:54,731 --> 00:44:02,135
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm really excited for the city council to go ahead and approve this so that we can actually look at some creative ways to fund it.

629
00:44:02,735 --> 00:44:08,458
[SPEAKER_17]: I think one thing that I haven't heard many people talk about is our payment in lieu of taxes with Tufts.

630
00:44:08,858 --> 00:44:11,599
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a really crappy agreement that we have right now.

631
00:44:11,659 --> 00:44:16,542
[SPEAKER_17]: Tufts is one of the worst colleges in the area with their payment in lieu of taxes.

632
00:44:16,915 --> 00:44:18,656
[SPEAKER_17]: And so Medford's getting really stiffed on that.

633
00:44:18,716 --> 00:44:27,183
[SPEAKER_17]: And so I think that that is one of many creative places that we might be able to look to get a lot of support for these matching funds for the library renovation.

634
00:44:27,444 --> 00:44:29,906
[SPEAKER_17]: It seems kind of crazy to leave $12 million on the table.

635
00:44:30,206 --> 00:44:33,769
[SPEAKER_17]: I know you guys have no control over what the city council actually does.

636
00:44:34,069 --> 00:44:40,875
[SPEAKER_17]: But I think this sort of symbolic gesture of putting forth a resolution to support it is really powerful.

637
00:44:40,935 --> 00:44:46,239
[SPEAKER_17]: And it shows that this most powerful educational decision-making body in the city

638
00:44:47,169 --> 00:44:49,831
[SPEAKER_17]: supports this, and I think the decision would hold a lot of weight.

639
00:44:49,871 --> 00:44:50,832
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's all I've got.

640
00:44:50,852 --> 00:44:51,493
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much.

641
00:44:51,513 --> 00:44:52,693
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much, Jessica.

642
00:44:56,176 --> 00:44:57,297
[SPEAKER_13]: You can stand up.

643
00:44:57,397 --> 00:44:58,077
[SPEAKER_13]: It should catch you.

644
00:44:58,137 --> 00:44:59,418
[SPEAKER_12]: Hopefully so.

645
00:44:59,919 --> 00:45:00,619
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm Matt Hughes.

646
00:45:00,699 --> 00:45:01,980
[SPEAKER_12]: I live at 76 Boston Ave.

647
00:45:02,961 --> 00:45:12,308
[SPEAKER_12]: I wanted to speak to some political possible misgivings that y'all might have about the prospect of making such a resolution in favor of the new library plan.

648
00:45:13,228 --> 00:45:26,311
[SPEAKER_12]: One, which is the possibility of pushback for the community, that this might be an overly symbolic gesture, and that the school community doesn't have direct control over matters that aren't related to school issues.

649
00:45:26,792 --> 00:45:31,733
[SPEAKER_12]: But in my view, this is a school issue, because public libraries often have...

650
00:45:33,413 --> 00:45:41,415
[SPEAKER_12]: programs which operate between school libraries and the public library system of the surrounding city.

651
00:45:42,115 --> 00:46:00,959
[SPEAKER_12]: So building, like, showing support for and getting this project off the ground would be one great first step in making sure that our school libraries can be better supported, which absolutely is your purview as an organization.

652
00:46:01,939 --> 00:46:03,740
[SPEAKER_12]: or as a body, I guess.

653
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:25,108
[SPEAKER_12]: Another political concern is related to something that my compatriot just mentioned, which is the possibility of maybe finding more funding for this by pursuing more funding from Tufts as an institution.

654
00:46:27,813 --> 00:46:48,490
[SPEAKER_12]: It's unfortunate that the political situation currently is one in which the city council seems to be of the mind that they're forced to choose between city services, like the police and fire stations, or a new library, public education.

655
00:46:49,490 --> 00:47:01,382
[SPEAKER_12]: And one thing that I would really, really be excited to see happen is for Tufts to step up and make it so that those two things are not mutually exclusive for the city that it inhabits.

656
00:47:03,003 --> 00:47:13,072
[SPEAKER_12]: This is well within Tufts' power to help us with, and I think it could be just a simple matter of asking them to make this not a problem anymore.

657
00:47:13,693 --> 00:47:28,426
[SPEAKER_12]: So I would love to see this resolution passed tonight to see as the first step in making sure that our agreement with Tufts is one that's strengthening our community and also that we have a nice, lovely library that we can all enjoy.

658
00:47:28,446 --> 00:47:29,828
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much.

659
00:47:37,099 --> 00:47:39,120
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, my name is Sam Sednick.

660
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:41,121
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm at 47 West Wyoming Avenue.

661
00:47:41,741 --> 00:47:52,226
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just wanted to come today to, I guess, thank you and your committee for taking just a slice of time to, uh, I guess offer an endorsement for the building of the public library.

662
00:47:52,246 --> 00:48:00,449
[SPEAKER_08]: The, um, the mayor has been with us from the very beginning when she kind of like gave us the push to go out and get the grant.

663
00:48:01,192 --> 00:48:10,855
[SPEAKER_08]: And the sport means a lot, both to us in the library community, but also to your children and to your teens and to your parents and your grandparents.

664
00:48:11,835 --> 00:48:16,256
[SPEAKER_08]: The library really is one of those places where we're there for literally everyone.

665
00:48:16,656 --> 00:48:20,377
[SPEAKER_08]: We are the first place new families bring out their youngest member.

666
00:48:20,957 --> 00:48:24,078
[SPEAKER_08]: We are there for the preschoolers where they learn how to paint,

667
00:48:25,065 --> 00:48:26,947
[SPEAKER_08]: beautiful Jackson Pollock paintings.

668
00:48:27,688 --> 00:48:29,169
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, we are there.

669
00:48:29,389 --> 00:48:36,636
[SPEAKER_08]: I just watched some first graders do their first independent reading with Calvin and Hobbes the other day in the library.

670
00:48:37,597 --> 00:48:41,040
[SPEAKER_08]: We love it when your families come in and celebrate Harry Potter's birthday with us.

671
00:48:41,841 --> 00:48:46,445
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's just a delight to see you guys every day all the way through.

672
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:49,108
[SPEAKER_08]: And once they get up to be teenagers, you know, we have

673
00:48:50,043 --> 00:48:55,845
[SPEAKER_08]: first blind dates in the library, and we get to be the ones that tell teenagers what not to do on a blind date in the library.

674
00:48:56,965 --> 00:49:07,168
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a really wonderful place, but we do need a building to be in, and so I do look forward to hopefully moving on with a new and stronger building.

675
00:49:08,888 --> 00:49:11,009
[SPEAKER_08]: We hope to always be the community center.

676
00:49:11,369 --> 00:49:20,573
[SPEAKER_08]: And just a weird aside, when children's librarians start, we always kind of pinpoint that first kid that's born after our time.

677
00:49:21,193 --> 00:49:24,735
[SPEAKER_08]: And I am just now hitting my five-year mark at Medford Public Library.

678
00:49:24,875 --> 00:49:29,557
[SPEAKER_08]: So the kid that was born shortly after I arrived here in this town

679
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:32,001
[SPEAKER_08]: is going to be going to kindergarten soon.

680
00:49:32,421 --> 00:49:34,461
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I will be passing him on to you.

681
00:49:34,562 --> 00:49:36,822
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's a delight and a lot of fun.

682
00:49:36,922 --> 00:49:40,483
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we're always happy to be your partners in education.

683
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:40,984
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

684
00:49:41,084 --> 00:49:41,544
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Ms.

685
00:49:41,564 --> 00:49:41,904
[SPEAKER_08]: Sednick.

686
00:49:47,226 --> 00:49:47,766
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening.

687
00:49:48,499 --> 00:49:49,860
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Sharon Diaso.

688
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:53,541
[SPEAKER_09]: I live at Mass Avenue and Circuit Road in Medford.

689
00:49:54,121 --> 00:50:02,484
[SPEAKER_09]: I also am in the field of education, was a member of public schools once, and now am a lecturer of literature and writing at a college.

690
00:50:03,324 --> 00:50:17,329
[SPEAKER_09]: I am, of course, very, I would say, not aggressive, but maintaining a whole ideal of the whole aura of the library being a wonderful atmosphere for families and children to grow up in.

691
00:50:19,189 --> 00:50:39,855
[SPEAKER_09]: However, I do have to admit, I would be very disappointed, very disappointed if anyone on this committee tonight, or even the council that I will be speaking to regarding this matter soon, sponsored, supported any building in plan by any architect or engineer that had a flat roof.

692
00:50:41,815 --> 00:50:46,437
[SPEAKER_09]: people who are calling me and saying, can you believe it?

693
00:50:46,457 --> 00:50:47,037
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you believe it?

694
00:50:47,057 --> 00:50:47,798
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you see the picture?

695
00:50:48,338 --> 00:50:50,979
[SPEAKER_09]: So you really need to take a lot of focus in mind.

696
00:50:51,439 --> 00:50:59,723
[SPEAKER_09]: The other thing I'd like to mention, I really think before you put the car before the horse, any building that gets constructed in the city or reconstructed

697
00:51:00,823 --> 00:51:03,965
[SPEAKER_09]: We think that the exterior of that building is very much intact.

698
00:51:04,405 --> 00:51:14,171
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, I asked two librarians one day, I won't mention who they were, if this were your home and you were driving out of the driveway going somewhere to work, would you tear this down?

699
00:51:14,191 --> 00:51:15,152
[SPEAKER_09]: They said, of course not.

700
00:51:15,612 --> 00:51:25,818
[SPEAKER_09]: And I said, well, you know, you have to do these things and come before the committee and the council before major, major projects are actually endorsed.

701
00:51:26,518 --> 00:51:29,260
[SPEAKER_09]: Am I for improving that facility?

702
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:30,020
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course.

703
00:51:31,161 --> 00:51:32,402
[SPEAKER_09]: We've heard too many woes.

704
00:51:32,782 --> 00:51:36,024
[SPEAKER_09]: Dangerous things could have happened there, just like at the Forest Park School.

705
00:51:36,504 --> 00:51:39,225
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure the mayor herself remembers some of those stories.

706
00:51:39,265 --> 00:51:41,187
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm older than probably anyone in this room.

707
00:51:41,827 --> 00:51:43,568
[SPEAKER_09]: But we're really imploring you.

708
00:51:43,968 --> 00:51:45,349
[SPEAKER_09]: to look at these guidelines.

709
00:51:45,889 --> 00:52:05,519
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, you should be aware that before anything is reconstructed or built, that you need to make sure that you have a maintenance fund established before, how did we get here in the first place, with the huge expenses, again, because we don't have a maintenance fund, you know, to go by.

710
00:52:05,919 --> 00:52:09,361
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for your time, and sorry to ruffle your feathers.

711
00:52:11,042 --> 00:52:11,762
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Benedetto?

712
00:52:11,983 --> 00:52:15,064
[SPEAKER_11]: I just had a point of information about Tufts.

713
00:52:15,564 --> 00:52:31,873
[SPEAKER_11]: Tufts University is holding a community presentation on Wednesday the 21st to inform the community members about programs and resources available to them and provide an overview of recently completed upcoming projects.

714
00:52:32,234 --> 00:52:38,377
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's at 6.30 on the 21st at the Alumni Lounge in Medford

715
00:52:39,194 --> 00:52:41,616
[SPEAKER_11]: Somerville Line up on the campus.

716
00:52:42,116 --> 00:52:44,418
[SPEAKER_11]: And they invited the public to come.

717
00:52:44,538 --> 00:52:48,400
[SPEAKER_11]: It's 40 Talbot Ave, 630, Wednesday the 21st.

718
00:52:49,381 --> 00:52:52,323
[SPEAKER_11]: Tufts is going to go over what they offer the city.

719
00:52:52,623 --> 00:52:56,906
[SPEAKER_11]: And what I find very interesting is they're doing Method and Somerville at the same time.

720
00:52:57,186 --> 00:53:01,669
[SPEAKER_11]: So we can see what they're offering Somerville a little bit and what we are getting.

721
00:53:02,049 --> 00:53:06,832
[SPEAKER_11]: And so my goal was to go to that meeting and just, I live in Tufts.

722
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:09,591
[SPEAKER_11]: neighborhood right there.

723
00:53:09,671 --> 00:53:12,113
[SPEAKER_11]: I live at the feet of Tufts.

724
00:53:12,414 --> 00:53:17,178
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm always up on campus, and I'm always interested in how they're giving back to the community.

725
00:53:17,458 --> 00:53:25,065
[SPEAKER_11]: I also am a parent of a Jumbo, and you get a great education there, and they are good to our students.

726
00:53:25,325 --> 00:53:32,852
[SPEAKER_11]: So they do do some positive things, but we just need to make sure that we're getting what we need from them.

727
00:53:34,326 --> 00:53:38,187
[SPEAKER_11]: A couple people spoke on that, so I thought they might be of interest for them to go.

728
00:53:38,467 --> 00:53:39,268
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for the time.

729
00:53:40,748 --> 00:53:43,529
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a motion on the floor for approval of this resolution?

730
00:53:43,549 --> 00:53:44,869
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Ruggiero, Ms.

731
00:53:44,889 --> 00:53:45,429
[SPEAKER_13]: Vander Kloot.

732
00:53:46,350 --> 00:53:55,072
[SPEAKER_22]: I just want to say that it's not been unusual over the years for the school committee to occasionally comment on something that's coming before the city council and vice versa.

733
00:53:55,092 --> 00:53:57,153
[SPEAKER_22]: The city council also comments on, um,

734
00:53:57,526 --> 00:54:03,531
[SPEAKER_22]: stuff that comes beyond us, so I feel comfortable in supporting the resolution.

735
00:54:04,051 --> 00:54:10,557
[SPEAKER_22]: I see the library as an essential element in any community, and I particularly want it to be a beautiful library in mine.

736
00:54:10,977 --> 00:54:13,359
[SPEAKER_22]: And we all know that the library needs some updates.

737
00:54:13,679 --> 00:54:20,565
[SPEAKER_22]: It's not particularly a surprise or a shock to any of us who have been in it, and we want

738
00:54:20,932 --> 00:54:22,913
[SPEAKER_22]: we would like to see improvements.

739
00:54:24,133 --> 00:54:31,396
[SPEAKER_22]: I think in terms of being members of the school committee, it just goes hand in hand with our caring about and dedication to our Medford children.

740
00:54:32,037 --> 00:54:35,638
[SPEAKER_22]: So I appreciate the resolution and I certainly will support it.

741
00:54:36,278 --> 00:54:37,499
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a second on the floor, Ms.

742
00:54:37,519 --> 00:54:37,959
[SPEAKER_13]: Vandekloot?

743
00:54:38,139 --> 00:54:38,439
[SPEAKER_13]: Second.

744
00:54:38,539 --> 00:54:39,180
[SPEAKER_13]: Seconded by Ms.

745
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:39,660
[SPEAKER_13]: Vandekloot.

746
00:54:40,557 --> 00:54:41,497
[SPEAKER_13]: Roll call vote, please.

747
00:54:42,798 --> 00:54:43,078
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

748
00:54:46,839 --> 00:54:49,820
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

749
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:50,380
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

750
00:54:51,441 --> 00:54:51,681
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

751
00:54:51,701 --> 00:54:53,441
[SPEAKER_13]: 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

752
00:54:53,481 --> 00:54:54,182
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

753
00:54:54,822 --> 00:54:55,702
[SPEAKER_13]: And please, Ms.

754
00:54:55,742 --> 00:54:57,883
[SPEAKER_13]: Nelson, if you could forward this along to the City Council.

755
00:55:00,169 --> 00:55:02,873
[SPEAKER_13]: Also while we're into suspension, we have a new business.

756
00:55:02,954 --> 00:55:07,881
[SPEAKER_13]: Be it resolved that the Medgar School Committee expresses sincere condolences to the family of Jennifer Tucci.

757
00:55:08,442 --> 00:55:08,602
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

758
00:55:08,622 --> 00:55:12,769
[SPEAKER_13]: Tucci was the mother of Harmony Tucci, a seventh grade student at the Andrews Middle School.

759
00:55:12,789 --> 00:55:15,093
[SPEAKER_13]: If we could all please rise for a moment of silence.

760
00:55:28,972 --> 00:55:32,495
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion to revert to the regular order of business by Mr. Azzurro, seconded by Ms.

761
00:55:32,515 --> 00:55:32,996
[SPEAKER_13]: Van de Kloet.

762
00:55:33,036 --> 00:55:33,797
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

763
00:55:33,817 --> 00:55:34,457
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

764
00:55:34,537 --> 00:55:35,338
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

765
00:55:35,618 --> 00:55:36,379
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

766
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:39,542
[SPEAKER_13]: Report on DECA competition award.

767
00:55:39,582 --> 00:55:42,485
[SPEAKER_13]: Recommendation to approve expenses for national competition.

768
00:55:42,525 --> 00:55:42,665
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

769
00:55:42,705 --> 00:55:43,046
[SPEAKER_13]: Nelson.

770
00:55:44,087 --> 00:55:44,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening.

771
00:55:44,607 --> 00:55:51,514
[SPEAKER_05]: We are very pleased tonight to congratulate Rosalie Howard on her success at the state level DECA competition.

772
00:55:57,936 --> 00:56:02,659
[SPEAKER_05]: And because of the success, she has been invited to go to the international competition.

773
00:56:02,759 --> 00:56:07,742
[SPEAKER_05]: So Mr. Fallon, would you like to present the details as we move forward?

774
00:56:08,243 --> 00:56:08,963
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, thank you.

775
00:56:09,003 --> 00:56:09,503
[SPEAKER_20]: Good evening.

776
00:56:10,504 --> 00:56:16,588
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm pleased to introduce tonight one of Medford Vocational School's finest, senior student Rosalie Howard.

777
00:56:17,268 --> 00:56:25,073
[SPEAKER_20]: Last week during the snow day, Rosalie joined over 2,900 students from 63 high schools and seven vocational technical high schools across the state.

778
00:56:25,662 --> 00:56:29,743
[SPEAKER_20]: to compete for a spot in the National Conference in Atlanta, Georgia.

779
00:56:30,783 --> 00:56:37,125
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll let Mr. D and Rosalie tell the rest, but what I want to share is that I was asked to judge the written and the oral presentations on this day.

780
00:56:37,145 --> 00:56:42,246
[SPEAKER_20]: It was my first time doing it at DECA, and I'm glad I did because it helped me understand just what they go through.

781
00:56:43,187 --> 00:56:55,150
[SPEAKER_20]: I was judging the presentation for international business plans of 18 students, and what was so thrilling was that I now could better understand the level of commitment and preparation that students like Rosalie endured to get to that point.

782
00:56:55,793 --> 00:56:59,034
[SPEAKER_20]: Of the 18 students I scored, I gave one perfect score.

783
00:56:59,655 --> 00:57:07,918
[SPEAKER_20]: So to really understand what it takes to get there, which Rosalie was able to accomplish, I really applaud her.

784
00:57:08,615 --> 00:57:19,618
[SPEAKER_20]: So before I turn it over, I have to acknowledge Mr. Frank DeLuisio for his commitment to our students, not only in DECA, but every day what he does in the business and marketing course, which I've had the pleasure of sitting in on numerous times this year.

785
00:57:20,398 --> 00:57:30,962
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. D is teaching these students not only the skills that transfer to the workforce, but a level of professionalism that help these students attain positions in their career, whether it be after high school or after college.

786
00:57:31,042 --> 00:57:31,722
[SPEAKER_20]: So thank you, Mr. D.

787
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:46,277
[SPEAKER_20]: And I also have to mention that this project was a collaborative effort that Rosalie had between not only the program she's in, but also with students in the robotics and engineering program.

788
00:57:46,658 --> 00:57:48,640
[SPEAKER_20]: So it was really a collaborative effort.

789
00:57:49,281 --> 00:57:54,207
[SPEAKER_20]: And after she explains a little bit more to you, I will then ask for some funding and approval.

790
00:57:55,268 --> 00:57:55,708
[SPEAKER_20]: Rosalie.

791
00:57:55,729 --> 00:57:56,489
[SPEAKER_19]: Take it away, Rosalie.

792
00:57:58,397 --> 00:58:01,980
[SPEAKER_19]: So my name is Rosalie Howard, and my project is Cubit.

793
00:58:02,581 --> 00:58:04,482
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's a toy for hearing and impaired children.

794
00:58:04,502 --> 00:58:10,888
[SPEAKER_19]: And the whole idea came up for my cousin, because he was born premature and nothing developed in his ears.

795
00:58:11,789 --> 00:58:20,136
[SPEAKER_19]: So the whole project is basically that there will be sign on it.

796
00:58:20,436 --> 00:58:24,820
[SPEAKER_19]: So they'll learn their sign, and then the toy will vibrate once they get it right.

797
00:58:27,779 --> 00:58:30,321
[SPEAKER_19]: If you want to try it, you can feel the vibration.

798
00:58:30,942 --> 00:58:33,044
[SPEAKER_19]: So it will reinforce.

799
00:58:33,084 --> 00:58:35,526
[SPEAKER_19]: They got the sign matched with the right piece.

800
00:58:35,686 --> 00:58:39,649
[SPEAKER_19]: And each piece will have their own magnetic piece on the bottom.

801
00:58:39,749 --> 00:58:41,491
[SPEAKER_19]: So there's like the mechanics inside.

802
00:58:41,511 --> 00:58:43,312
[SPEAKER_19]: So you can see how it will vibrate.

803
00:58:44,734 --> 00:58:45,674
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's what I did.

804
00:58:45,915 --> 00:58:46,595
[SPEAKER_19]: Excellent.

805
00:58:46,735 --> 00:58:47,736
[SPEAKER_13]: Congratulations.

806
00:58:47,756 --> 00:58:47,996
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

807
00:58:52,450 --> 00:58:53,951
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, Rosalie, can I ask you one question?

808
00:58:53,991 --> 00:58:54,231
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

809
00:58:54,312 --> 00:58:55,993
[SPEAKER_13]: Did they use a 3D printer on that?

810
00:58:56,013 --> 00:58:57,554
[SPEAKER_13]: No, they used a laser cutter.

811
00:58:57,574 --> 00:58:58,495
[SPEAKER_13]: A laser cutter.

812
00:58:58,515 --> 00:58:58,915
[SPEAKER_13]: Awesome.

813
00:58:58,955 --> 00:58:59,015
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

814
00:58:59,035 --> 00:58:59,516
[SPEAKER_13]: OK, cool.

815
00:58:59,536 --> 00:58:59,596
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow.

816
00:58:59,616 --> 00:59:00,136
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion to accept.

817
00:59:00,156 --> 00:59:12,026
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to approve the request of $2,700 to send Rosalie forward.

818
00:59:12,046 --> 00:59:12,246
Second.

819
00:59:12,346 --> 00:59:12,867
On the move.

820
00:59:12,907 --> 00:59:13,988
[SPEAKER_13]: Roll call vote.

821
00:59:14,008 --> 00:59:14,968
[SPEAKER_13]: Chad, your work is done.

822
00:59:15,048 --> 00:59:15,489
[SPEAKER_13]: You've done it.

823
00:59:15,509 --> 00:59:17,230
[SPEAKER_13]: That's easy.

824
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:18,711
[SPEAKER_13]: Roll call vote, please, Ms.

825
00:59:18,731 --> 00:59:18,892
[SPEAKER_13]: Kress.

826
00:59:18,912 --> 00:59:19,512
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you get a yes?

827
00:59:21,233 --> 00:59:21,334
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

828
00:59:29,482 --> 00:59:31,624
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

829
00:59:31,724 --> 00:59:32,565
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

830
00:59:33,045 --> 00:59:36,889
[SPEAKER_13]: We wish you the best of luck during April vacation, is it?

831
00:59:36,929 --> 00:59:37,689
[SPEAKER_13]: The week after.

832
00:59:38,050 --> 00:59:38,990
[SPEAKER_13]: The week after April.

833
00:59:39,811 --> 00:59:40,332
[SPEAKER_13]: Very nice.

834
00:59:41,232 --> 00:59:42,874
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. D, would you like to say a few words?

835
00:59:42,894 --> 00:59:44,235
[SPEAKER_20]: I just want Mr. D to say something.

836
00:59:44,295 --> 00:59:44,915
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

837
00:59:46,397 --> 00:59:47,898
[SPEAKER_02]: So this was all Rosalie.

838
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:53,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything about DECA is academically based.

839
00:59:54,368 --> 00:59:59,009
[SPEAKER_02]: Administrators and school community, they just see a bunch of kids going off.

840
01:00:00,169 --> 01:00:03,230
[SPEAKER_02]: This project was entrepreneurship innovation.

841
01:00:04,790 --> 01:00:17,493
[SPEAKER_02]: And on your packets where I summarized, you're going to notice when we went to states and internationals, it moves from competition to career development conference.

842
01:00:18,414 --> 01:00:23,935
[SPEAKER_02]: So everything Rosalie has done and accomplished now is part of her career.

843
01:00:25,823 --> 01:00:30,405
[SPEAKER_02]: So I appreciate the support we've had from you.

844
01:00:32,046 --> 01:00:34,027
[SPEAKER_02]: We were fortunate to get a judge.

845
01:00:34,587 --> 01:00:36,227
[SPEAKER_02]: And Rosalie came back.

846
01:00:36,267 --> 01:00:38,949
[SPEAKER_02]: I always have the kids come back where I'm working.

847
01:00:39,449 --> 01:00:41,210
[SPEAKER_02]: And I asked them how they did.

848
01:00:42,290 --> 01:00:43,310
[SPEAKER_02]: She was very calm.

849
01:00:43,471 --> 01:00:47,112
[SPEAKER_02]: And she said, Mr. D, this judge was waiting for me.

850
01:00:47,652 --> 01:00:48,833
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, what do you mean?

851
01:00:49,593 --> 01:00:53,795
[SPEAKER_02]: She goes, he stood up, shook my hands, and pulled the paper out.

852
01:00:54,820 --> 01:00:55,520
[SPEAKER_02]: on his desk.

853
01:00:56,821 --> 01:01:00,603
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he went on into the presentation, and he bored in on her passion.

854
01:01:02,364 --> 01:01:10,728
[SPEAKER_02]: And lastly, he said, I can't tell you how you're going to do, but what are you going to do with this after you graduate?

855
01:01:12,129 --> 01:01:15,130
[SPEAKER_02]: And she got a perfect score, which is sort of unheard of.

856
01:01:20,143 --> 01:01:21,244
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it already trademarked?

857
01:01:21,364 --> 01:01:22,945
[SPEAKER_13]: Not yet.

858
01:01:23,326 --> 01:01:24,246
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll get you a lawyer.

859
01:01:24,467 --> 01:01:25,187
[SPEAKER_13]: You're going to need one.

860
01:01:25,347 --> 01:01:28,370
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's how it went down.

861
01:01:28,710 --> 01:01:33,954
[SPEAKER_02]: And I felt after she came back that she was definitely going to qualify.

862
01:01:34,094 --> 01:01:42,941
[SPEAKER_02]: But when she walked away with first place, that itself, the whole thing is moving on, the first four slots.

863
01:01:43,081 --> 01:01:47,605
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you take first place, that's differentiate yourself.

864
01:01:48,133 --> 01:01:53,096
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thank you for the support, and have a good summer.

865
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:54,317
[SPEAKER_13]: Congratulations.

866
01:01:54,617 --> 01:01:55,237
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice job.

867
01:01:59,280 --> 01:01:59,740
[SPEAKER_13]: Excellent.

868
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:00,741
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Ruggiero.

869
01:02:00,761 --> 01:02:09,526
[SPEAKER_16]: Is it possible that we could have an official appreciation certification that we could do through the school committee?

870
01:02:09,546 --> 01:02:11,387
[SPEAKER_13]: Why don't we wait until after April, and we'll bring her back.

871
01:02:13,449 --> 01:02:13,889
[SPEAKER_13]: Very good.

872
01:02:15,713 --> 01:02:18,515
[SPEAKER_13]: Next report on McGlynn Middle School Principalship.

873
01:02:20,236 --> 01:02:20,857
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I'm sorry.

874
01:02:20,877 --> 01:02:21,958
[SPEAKER_13]: It was making a hum.

875
01:02:23,379 --> 01:02:37,709
[SPEAKER_05]: We are pleased to report that Mr. Nicholas Tucci, Assistant Principal at Medford High School, has been appointed the Senior Acting Principal of the John J. McGlynn Middle School for the remainder of this school year.

876
01:02:37,729 --> 01:02:41,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Tucci is in his fifth year as an administrator.

877
01:02:41,672 --> 01:02:42,573
[SPEAKER_05]: He's with us tonight.

878
01:02:42,853 --> 01:02:45,055
[SPEAKER_05]: Gonna let him come up because he's had some exciting days.

879
01:02:46,075 --> 01:02:50,120
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a graduate of Medford High School and very accomplished, highly respected.

880
01:02:52,122 --> 01:02:54,384
[SPEAKER_05]: We had the open house on Thursday evening.

881
01:02:54,444 --> 01:02:57,888
[SPEAKER_05]: He was there to speak to the fifth grade parents and students.

882
01:02:58,629 --> 01:03:04,395
[SPEAKER_05]: We were meeting with the teachers Friday afternoon after school and today was his first full day and he met with students.

883
01:03:04,495 --> 01:03:06,718
[SPEAKER_05]: So Nick, would you like to tell us more about

884
01:03:07,125 --> 01:03:08,806
[SPEAKER_05]: how it's going so far, but we thank you.

885
01:03:08,826 --> 01:03:13,490
[SPEAKER_00]: It was my second first day of school this year, so I got another one knocked out of the way.

886
01:03:13,570 --> 01:03:20,575
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been a whirlwind of a week for me, saying goodbye to my high school seniors who I supervised over the course of their four years.

887
01:03:21,878 --> 01:03:29,520
[SPEAKER_00]: I left Medford High School on Friday to an ovation from the senior class, which made me feel very nice, and headed over to the McGlynn Middle School.

888
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,881
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been equally as received.

889
01:03:32,561 --> 01:03:38,382
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very pleased to say that the students meeting with each one of the classes today was an awesome experience.

890
01:03:38,502 --> 01:03:43,904
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a chance to meet with each one of the classes in an assembly format, share with them my story.

891
01:03:44,724 --> 01:03:50,709
[SPEAKER_00]: share with them my expectations and my hopes for a very successful spring finish to the school year.

892
01:03:51,570 --> 01:04:02,339
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, on Friday I had the opportunity to meet with all the teachers in the library and share with them my vision, my hopes to work with them in a collaborative fashion, and really have a great school year too as well.

893
01:04:02,619 --> 01:04:06,262
[SPEAKER_00]: And as Miss Nelson said, Thursday evening was also a special one.

894
01:04:07,603 --> 01:04:11,827
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a filled auditorium at the McGlynn Middle School, a lot of excitement in the air,

895
01:04:12,407 --> 01:04:23,991
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very special to hear fellow faculty members talk about one another, about how special of an experience they have working together with one another, and how much passion they have for what their field is.

896
01:04:24,771 --> 01:04:29,392
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes me feel very excited to be the principal of that school, the acting principal.

897
01:04:29,412 --> 01:04:31,593
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking forward to the opportunity.

898
01:04:31,613 --> 01:04:37,815
[SPEAKER_00]: While at the same point in time, I am a little sad to leave Medford High School, I am very excited about these new beginnings.

899
01:04:39,391 --> 01:04:45,095
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can probably just say that it was an awesome day today, very exciting, and look forward to many more to come.

900
01:04:45,495 --> 01:04:47,196
[SPEAKER_00]: I thank you for the opportunity.

901
01:04:47,356 --> 01:04:49,278
[SPEAKER_13]: What was your feedback after the open house?

902
01:04:49,778 --> 01:04:50,999
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you get to talk to many parents?

903
01:04:51,472 --> 01:04:53,074
[SPEAKER_00]: The parents were very excited.

904
01:04:53,475 --> 01:04:57,579
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the passion from the faculty members really exuded.

905
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:05,429
[SPEAKER_00]: Also the student ambassadors were terrific in showing me around and also a lot of the projects in the school were very, very exciting.

906
01:05:05,449 --> 01:05:06,470
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to working with Ms.

907
01:05:06,510 --> 01:05:10,155
[SPEAKER_00]: Evangelista to highlight a lot of those great projects too as well over the coming months.

908
01:05:11,095 --> 01:05:21,562
[SPEAKER_00]: really showcase what is really excellent about that school and building upon the success they've had in the past and trying to make sure that we continue upon them and create an awesome vision for the future.

909
01:05:22,143 --> 01:05:23,364
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll do a report.

910
01:05:23,384 --> 01:05:30,388
[SPEAKER_05]: We have the Andrews open house tomorrow night and I was planning to do a full report on both open houses at the next meeting.

911
01:05:31,109 --> 01:05:33,570
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a great turnout on Thursday evening.

912
01:05:33,590 --> 01:05:35,812
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm hoping to have a great turnout tomorrow night and

913
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:41,121
[SPEAKER_05]: We have actually, you know, we have attendants, so we know how many people actually showed up in families.

914
01:05:41,442 --> 01:05:45,523
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll present all of that to you when we finish up with the open house tomorrow night.

915
01:05:46,223 --> 01:05:48,544
[SPEAKER_13]: And thank you to the McGlynn teachers that are here this evening.

916
01:05:48,804 --> 01:05:53,225
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for your support and working through to make this school as great as it can be.

917
01:05:53,325 --> 01:05:54,586
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's a lot of buzz out there.

918
01:05:54,686 --> 01:05:57,386
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're very proud of all your work and yours as well.

919
01:05:57,546 --> 01:05:58,047
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you.

920
01:05:58,267 --> 01:05:59,247
[SPEAKER_05]: And I want to thank Ms.

921
01:05:59,307 --> 01:06:02,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Lu because she has, you know, assisted a great deal this year.

922
01:06:02,828 --> 01:06:05,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Scholar is staying on with us until the end of March.

923
01:06:06,517 --> 01:06:09,298
[SPEAKER_05]: helping with the transition, but again I do want to acknowledge Ms.

924
01:06:09,338 --> 01:06:12,738
[SPEAKER_05]: Liu for all the support and I know you two will work very well together.

925
01:06:13,018 --> 01:06:22,960
[SPEAKER_13]: If we invite you back for graduation Mr. Tucci, would you like to sit up on the dais?

926
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:24,100
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry?

927
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:26,140
[SPEAKER_13]: Would you like to be at graduation this year?

928
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:31,061
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what, I promised the seniors that I'd be at each one of the senior events, the major senior events, so you can count on me at graduation.

929
01:06:31,121 --> 01:06:31,781
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a date then.

930
01:06:31,801 --> 01:06:32,822
[SPEAKER_00]: I very much look forward to that.

931
01:06:32,862 --> 01:06:33,142
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

932
01:06:34,342 --> 01:06:34,862
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Russo.

933
01:06:35,497 --> 01:06:37,838
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, I just wanted to provide some feedback.

934
01:06:38,398 --> 01:06:46,042
[SPEAKER_15]: I received text messages from a number of parents that went to the McGlynn open house, and they were beyond excited.

935
01:06:46,603 --> 01:06:50,825
[SPEAKER_15]: And they just could not believe how wonderful the event was.

936
01:06:51,045 --> 01:06:55,707
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't get to go, so I can't really give more feedback than what I received.

937
01:06:55,827 --> 01:06:58,789
[SPEAKER_15]: But they were universally very excited.

938
01:06:58,889 --> 01:07:00,109
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you very much.

939
01:07:00,870 --> 01:07:01,250
[SPEAKER_13]: Excellent.

940
01:07:01,755 --> 01:07:12,697
[SPEAKER_05]: And I want to thank Dr. Cadelli, too, because she put together the PowerPoint, and it was really a collaborative effort with administrators, with students, with parents, and the teachers, of course.

941
01:07:12,757 --> 01:07:16,718
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think with everybody together like that, it was a very powerful evening.

942
01:07:17,418 --> 01:07:17,778
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.

943
01:07:17,798 --> 01:07:21,218
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to make one comment.

944
01:07:21,258 --> 01:07:22,699
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Benedetto, then Ms.

945
01:07:22,719 --> 01:07:22,839
[SPEAKER_11]: Krutz.

946
01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:30,420
[SPEAKER_11]: First of all, I think Mr. Tucci's placement over at the McGlen is an excellent

947
01:07:32,605 --> 01:07:33,606
[SPEAKER_11]: choice right now.

948
01:07:33,766 --> 01:07:38,890
[SPEAKER_11]: I know parents came forward at our last meeting with concerns of spreading Mr. DeLava too thin.

949
01:07:39,030 --> 01:07:47,256
[SPEAKER_11]: So I appreciate the administration making a thoughtful and really appropriate choice to send him down.

950
01:07:47,456 --> 01:07:52,300
[SPEAKER_11]: So I wanted to say thank you very much for really thinking about good choices.

951
01:07:53,220 --> 01:08:00,886
[SPEAKER_11]: And I appreciate the high school making arrangements and filling in so that way he could step in this position.

952
01:08:01,236 --> 01:08:06,440
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know it's a growth potential for Mr. Tucci as well, and a well-deserved one.

953
01:08:06,721 --> 01:08:11,505
[SPEAKER_11]: I've observed him over the years as a committee member, and I've seen him grow in his career.

954
01:08:11,905 --> 01:08:15,688
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that he's a great professional from what I've observed.

955
01:08:16,209 --> 01:08:23,535
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm really happy that he took this step for himself and for the McGlenn community as a whole.

956
01:08:23,855 --> 01:08:25,997
[SPEAKER_11]: So I wanted to start by saying thank you.

957
01:08:27,644 --> 01:08:31,866
[SPEAKER_11]: and if you can convey that to others who I'm sure had a role in that.

958
01:08:33,107 --> 01:08:39,230
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, I wanted to say I did attend the open house at the McGlen, and I was extremely excited.

959
01:08:39,751 --> 01:08:49,456
[SPEAKER_11]: My children both went through the McGlen, and I saw all the projects, and there was a landscape of people's yards, and one of them had a pool, and that's the one I liked the most because I really want a pool.

960
01:08:50,977 --> 01:08:53,338
[SPEAKER_11]: I got outvoted by my family, so we don't have one.

961
01:08:53,838 --> 01:08:55,459
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think we have enough square footage either.

962
01:08:57,847 --> 01:09:01,790
[SPEAKER_11]: So it was really fun to walk the halls and see the people and see the community.

963
01:09:02,311 --> 01:09:06,694
[SPEAKER_11]: And yourself and Dr. Riccadeli did an excellent job.

964
01:09:07,635 --> 01:09:12,779
[SPEAKER_11]: And I look forward to seeing tomorrow nights because I'm going to try very hard to be there as well.

965
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:21,425
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I do think that it was pretty full and I would have loved to seen it like filled to the capacity, but it is a big auditorium.

966
01:09:21,525 --> 01:09:24,948
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, we'll see what tomorrow night brings and um,

967
01:09:25,445 --> 01:09:28,187
[SPEAKER_11]: Your presentation maybe could be posted online.

968
01:09:28,247 --> 01:09:31,750
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if anybody recorded it, but it's worthy of that.

969
01:09:31,890 --> 01:09:32,831
[SPEAKER_11]: It was very good.

970
01:09:32,871 --> 01:09:35,873
[SPEAKER_11]: You went through everything that parents could have for questions.

971
01:09:36,293 --> 01:09:40,537
[SPEAKER_11]: I liked you bringing someone down who graduated from McGlen.

972
01:09:40,557 --> 01:09:43,939
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it was Sebastian.

973
01:09:43,979 --> 01:09:45,220
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, I can't talk tonight.

974
01:09:45,260 --> 01:09:45,941
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm very tired.

975
01:09:46,021 --> 01:09:47,842
[SPEAKER_11]: Sebastian Tringali did a wonderful job.

976
01:09:47,882 --> 01:09:49,123
[SPEAKER_11]: And he spoke beautifully.

977
01:09:49,343 --> 01:09:52,266
[SPEAKER_11]: And so did the parents of current teachers.

978
01:09:52,326 --> 01:09:53,747
[SPEAKER_11]: They were very impactful.

979
01:09:54,462 --> 01:10:03,104
[SPEAKER_11]: And the whole flow of the evening was very well done, and you represented our district very well to the parents moving on.

980
01:10:03,144 --> 01:10:10,466
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think parents left there like, this is a great place to bring my children, so.

981
01:10:10,666 --> 01:10:11,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

982
01:10:11,246 --> 01:10:11,466
[SPEAKER_05]: Good job.

983
01:10:11,486 --> 01:10:12,026
[SPEAKER_05]: We appreciate that.

984
01:10:12,326 --> 01:10:21,849
[SPEAKER_05]: We are a team, and I will have to say that Dr. Perella deserves a lot of gratitude, because he was one of the people that said, you know what, I know you need Nick at the McGlynn,

985
01:10:22,790 --> 01:10:24,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Sacrifice, it is a sacrifice to him.

986
01:10:24,731 --> 01:10:28,272
[SPEAKER_05]: It picks up the work pace for the rest of the people that are at the high school.

987
01:10:28,693 --> 01:10:35,055
[SPEAKER_05]: So I thank Dr. Perrella for also being very generous and sharing Nick with McGlynn for the remainder of the school year.

988
01:10:35,595 --> 01:10:38,657
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just had one final question.

989
01:10:38,697 --> 01:10:43,219
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want to ruin all the love fest, but we need to speak about graduation.

990
01:10:43,259 --> 01:10:48,141
[SPEAKER_11]: And usually Mr. Belson speaks at graduation, but since he's retiring April 30th,

991
01:10:49,152 --> 01:10:51,172
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just asking, would that be you, Ms.

992
01:10:51,212 --> 01:10:51,632
[SPEAKER_11]: Nelson?

993
01:10:51,692 --> 01:10:54,393
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be... We can rename acting superintendent.

994
01:10:54,553 --> 01:10:55,353
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, okay.

995
01:10:55,473 --> 01:11:03,715
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't know if it... That's why I was just bringing it up for something to think about for future because it was mentioned earlier and just brought it to my mind.

996
01:11:04,095 --> 01:11:13,996
[SPEAKER_11]: So just something for the committee to put in their mind as a thought and maybe we should speak about it soon because graduation is coming.

997
01:11:15,277 --> 01:11:15,717
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

998
01:11:16,117 --> 01:11:16,857
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for your time.

999
01:11:18,180 --> 01:11:20,902
[SPEAKER_14]: I wanted to say, I was at the open house, and it was great.

1000
01:11:21,042 --> 01:11:22,283
[SPEAKER_14]: It was just fantastic.

1001
01:11:22,323 --> 01:11:26,986
[SPEAKER_14]: And I loved how it was so personable with the parents and the teachers speaking and the students.

1002
01:11:27,066 --> 01:11:32,710
[SPEAKER_14]: And I actually learned a lot about Mr. Tucci, that he was a baseball player, and he was on the San Diego Padres.

1003
01:11:32,790 --> 01:11:33,811
[SPEAKER_14]: I was so impressed.

1004
01:11:34,612 --> 01:11:36,493
[SPEAKER_14]: I found that out at the open house.

1005
01:11:36,573 --> 01:11:40,676
[SPEAKER_14]: And the students did a great, great job taking people around.

1006
01:11:40,736 --> 01:11:41,857
[SPEAKER_14]: The groups were filled.

1007
01:11:42,717 --> 01:11:45,239
[SPEAKER_14]: Going up to the classrooms, the classrooms were filled.

1008
01:11:45,657 --> 01:11:53,879
[SPEAKER_14]: The teachers did a great job with the setup of the projects that were out, and just going over everything, asking questions.

1009
01:11:54,019 --> 01:11:56,840
[SPEAKER_14]: It was just a really, it was a very fun evening.

1010
01:11:56,980 --> 01:11:57,921
[SPEAKER_14]: I had a really fun time.

1011
01:11:58,521 --> 01:12:02,882
[SPEAKER_14]: And I wish the McGlynn the best, you know, and all the luck.

1012
01:12:03,082 --> 01:12:07,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I want to thank, too, my administrative assistant, Jeannie Gleona, who had all the cards arranged.

1013
01:12:07,443 --> 01:12:08,724
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of it was organization.

1014
01:12:08,944 --> 01:12:09,104
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

1015
01:12:09,184 --> 01:12:13,265
[SPEAKER_05]: Liu obviously helped a great deal with that, doing the groups, as did the teachers.

1016
01:12:13,784 --> 01:12:17,187
[SPEAKER_05]: But Jeannie showed up in the evening and had all the cards.

1017
01:12:17,267 --> 01:12:19,409
[SPEAKER_05]: And everything went pretty flawlessly.

1018
01:12:19,449 --> 01:12:23,792
[SPEAKER_05]: And she's still making the cards tonight, I think, in preparation for tomorrow night.

1019
01:12:24,213 --> 01:12:24,573
[SPEAKER_13]: It was good.

1020
01:12:24,633 --> 01:12:25,254
[SPEAKER_05]: It was perfect.

1021
01:12:26,054 --> 01:12:26,174
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

1022
01:12:26,274 --> 01:12:26,775
[SPEAKER_13]: Vander Kloot.

1023
01:12:27,555 --> 01:12:31,939
[SPEAKER_22]: No, again, I just wanted to add my thanks to Mr. Tucci.

1024
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:37,884
[SPEAKER_22]: And also just to say that parents came before us at our last meeting.

1025
01:12:38,004 --> 01:12:40,006
[SPEAKER_22]: And it was difficult because we didn't respond to them.

1026
01:12:40,086 --> 01:12:42,148
[SPEAKER_22]: We didn't say anything about, I think,

1027
01:12:43,135 --> 01:12:45,637
[SPEAKER_22]: After they left, I said, I just want to say I hear your concerns.

1028
01:12:46,177 --> 01:12:50,900
[SPEAKER_22]: So we really, we did hear their concerns and took appropriate action.

1029
01:12:51,781 --> 01:12:52,301
[SPEAKER_22]: So thank you.

1030
01:12:52,401 --> 01:12:54,523
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'm glad the open house went so well.

1031
01:12:55,263 --> 01:13:02,148
[SPEAKER_22]: My colleague, Mr. Russo and the mayor, we were, we were off at the superintendent search committee that evening.

1032
01:13:02,228 --> 01:13:05,490
[SPEAKER_22]: So I didn't get to go, but I'm glad that it went so well.

1033
01:13:07,247 --> 01:13:07,647
[SPEAKER_13]: Very good.

1034
01:13:07,708 --> 01:13:12,533
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a motion on the floor to accept this report and place it on file by Mr. Ruggiero, seconded by Mr. Russo?

1035
01:13:12,713 --> 01:13:13,434
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

1036
01:13:13,454 --> 01:13:13,514
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

1037
01:13:14,455 --> 01:13:15,095
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

1038
01:13:15,135 --> 01:13:15,816
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

1039
01:13:16,497 --> 01:13:19,540
[SPEAKER_13]: Recommendation to approve grade 8 New York City field trip.

1040
01:13:20,601 --> 01:13:25,987
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, it's that time of year that the grade 8 students at both middle schools are

1041
01:13:26,721 --> 01:13:29,282
[SPEAKER_05]: preparing to go on their New York City field trip.

1042
01:13:29,342 --> 01:13:32,323
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been a tradition since 2001.

1043
01:13:33,224 --> 01:13:40,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, both middle schools have planned the same time period to make sure that the kids don't miss a lot of school.

1044
01:13:40,467 --> 01:13:45,609
[SPEAKER_05]: They miss just the Friday, and they return on the Sunday, and it's June 8th through the 10th.

1045
01:13:46,429 --> 01:13:51,431
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, we're here tonight to request that you approve the trip.

1046
01:13:51,551 --> 01:13:56,213
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little bit later, but again, we had that situation where the field trip policy

1047
01:13:56,694 --> 01:14:00,796
[SPEAKER_05]: was under review and so we wanted to wait until that was approved to bring this to you.

1048
01:14:01,317 --> 01:14:10,301
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have teachers, we have administrators who can explain anything about the trip and I guess we're ready to go in June, right?

1049
01:14:10,942 --> 01:14:11,442
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1050
01:14:12,102 --> 01:14:14,664
[SPEAKER_13]: It has not always been New York though.

1051
01:14:15,224 --> 01:14:15,424
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

1052
01:14:15,624 --> 01:14:16,625
[SPEAKER_13]: You've gone to other locations.

1053
01:14:16,645 --> 01:14:19,767
[SPEAKER_18]: We have gone to other locations and I think to note that

1054
01:14:21,749 --> 01:14:26,493
[SPEAKER_18]: Sometimes cost is always a factor, and going to Washington happens to be an increase in cost.

1055
01:14:27,653 --> 01:14:35,239
[SPEAKER_18]: It's already, I feel somewhat of an exorbitant amount that we asked for, so to go even further would be difficult.

1056
01:14:35,961 --> 01:14:40,987
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd like to introduce Mr. Michael DiClemente who is our new New York City Trip Advisor who took over from Ms.

1057
01:14:41,027 --> 01:14:41,307
[SPEAKER_18]: Lavin.

1058
01:14:42,268 --> 01:14:42,488
[SPEAKER_18]: Ms.

1059
01:14:42,528 --> 01:14:48,375
[SPEAKER_18]: Lavin who is currently at the high school and he's been great keeping in touch with me regarding things.

1060
01:14:49,396 --> 01:14:51,779
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll say if you've got a look at our itinerary

1061
01:14:52,739 --> 01:14:56,921
[SPEAKER_18]: Every year we go by the Intrepid and I keep saying, we gotta get on the Intrepid.

1062
01:14:57,481 --> 01:14:58,641
[SPEAKER_18]: Every year I say that.

1063
01:14:58,701 --> 01:15:00,162
[SPEAKER_18]: Take a picture of it, we gotta get on there.

1064
01:15:00,862 --> 01:15:06,024
[SPEAKER_18]: We have that on our itinerary, which is something that's exciting for us to do as a science guy.

1065
01:15:06,044 --> 01:15:11,926
[SPEAKER_18]: I love going to see the space shuttle Columbia that's hidden in the actual carrier.

1066
01:15:13,367 --> 01:15:18,229
[SPEAKER_18]: So as was stated, at the Andrews we have 83 students that are currently enrolled going.

1067
01:15:18,669 --> 01:15:19,949
[SPEAKER_18]: Cost is at $550 per student.

1068
01:15:22,211 --> 01:15:26,452
[SPEAKER_18]: We do have a couple of financial scholarships that we are providing to some students as well.

1069
01:15:26,472 --> 01:15:37,914
[SPEAKER_18]: Again, due to confidentiality, I'd like to kind of keep the number down, but we do have enough to provide coverage of the cost for some families that are struggling.

1070
01:15:37,934 --> 01:15:41,935
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm trying to think of what else to say.

1071
01:15:41,975 --> 01:15:49,236
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, if you see the itinerary, the plan is, I think this year we cut out the Bronx Zoo because we did not hit

1072
01:15:49,942 --> 01:15:51,963
[SPEAKER_18]: that 90 percentile mark.

1073
01:15:52,143 --> 01:15:58,307
[SPEAKER_18]: And again, we did not want to raise up the cost because it would have cost us more in order to do that.

1074
01:15:59,087 --> 01:16:01,869
[SPEAKER_18]: So we had to take the Bronx Zoo out of the mix.

1075
01:16:03,990 --> 01:16:09,013
[SPEAKER_18]: Again, just something that you have to do to figure out to make sure that people can all go.

1076
01:16:09,354 --> 01:16:10,794
[SPEAKER_18]: If you remember last year, we were over.

1077
01:16:11,575 --> 01:16:12,435
[SPEAKER_18]: This year, we're under.

1078
01:16:12,615 --> 01:16:17,759
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's a trip that can go either way, dependent on interest and

1079
01:16:19,254 --> 01:16:23,779
[SPEAKER_18]: what the thoughts are for people that, you know, during that time, some people just don't want to go.

1080
01:16:23,819 --> 01:16:25,540
[SPEAKER_18]: And we understand that, you know, it makes sense.

1081
01:16:26,081 --> 01:16:27,302
[SPEAKER_18]: It is mostly a weekend trip.

1082
01:16:27,322 --> 01:16:32,507
[SPEAKER_18]: There is that Friday, but we allow people to have that choice to decide what they want to do.

1083
01:16:34,129 --> 01:16:36,872
[SPEAKER_18]: I can let Mike talk more because he's been doing more of the,

1084
01:16:37,749 --> 01:16:38,229
[SPEAKER_18]: the legwork.

1085
01:16:38,429 --> 01:16:38,529
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah.

1086
01:16:38,549 --> 01:16:41,150
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, I don't know if there are any specific questions.

1087
01:16:41,610 --> 01:16:43,331
[SPEAKER_23]: I basically took over from Miss Lavin.

1088
01:16:43,351 --> 01:16:46,952
[SPEAKER_23]: So the itinerary that's there was something that she had set up the previous June.

1089
01:16:46,972 --> 01:16:50,433
[SPEAKER_23]: That's why we're a little bit slow going and getting the approval, um, this year.

1090
01:16:50,473 --> 01:16:55,094
[SPEAKER_23]: And we did have to cut out the one thing that she had set up last year just because we didn't have enough, um, students.

1091
01:16:55,154 --> 01:17:03,077
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, if 15 kids came right now and said they wanted to go, we could have the Bronx who again on Sunday, but for right now it'd be cut out, but I'm happy to answer any specifics.

1092
01:17:04,177 --> 01:17:04,877
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Benedetto.

1093
01:17:04,997 --> 01:17:05,377
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1094
01:17:05,677 --> 01:17:06,818
[SPEAKER_11]: How many children, uh, uh,

1095
01:17:08,408 --> 01:17:12,272
[SPEAKER_23]: book at the end was right now, 83 in the McGlynn 57.

1096
01:17:15,096 --> 01:17:25,107
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, and Mr. Delaver mentioned that the Andrews, um, students received financial

1097
01:17:26,512 --> 01:17:28,693
[SPEAKER_11]: opportunities to attend if they didn't have it.

1098
01:17:28,733 --> 01:17:35,935
[SPEAKER_11]: Does the McGlynn have a fund that's big enough to make sure every student with financial need that wants to go can go?

1099
01:17:36,255 --> 01:17:47,879
[SPEAKER_01]: So this year we actually had two anonymous donors donate a full ride for two different students and we were able to actually split one of those up so we were able to help more families with those two scholarships.

1100
01:17:48,259 --> 01:17:50,300
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did something a little bit different with that this year.

1101
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:51,420
[SPEAKER_01]: We opened up

1102
01:17:52,514 --> 01:18:14,967
[SPEAKER_01]: the scholarship opportunities to all students who wanted to participate and they were allowed to write a letter explaining their interest in going to New York City and that based on a committee of 8th grade teachers who helped with input with backgrounds of families and students and we kind of chose students who were

1103
01:18:16,589 --> 01:18:18,810
[SPEAKER_01]: weren't actually able to go on their own.

1104
01:18:19,130 --> 01:18:22,852
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have three students going that probably wouldn't have been able to make it.

1105
01:18:23,192 --> 01:18:24,633
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's great.

1106
01:18:24,893 --> 01:18:28,695
[SPEAKER_01]: However, we would always love more, but that's what we have right now.

1107
01:18:29,115 --> 01:18:29,656
[SPEAKER_13]: Excellent.

1108
01:18:29,676 --> 01:18:33,457
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, keep us posted if some come through that are in need.

1109
01:18:33,678 --> 01:18:38,960
[SPEAKER_01]: So it did every student that is in need that wanted to go able to go at this point?

1110
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:39,521
[SPEAKER_01]: Good question.

1111
01:18:39,681 --> 01:18:44,383
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, every student that wrote in with a request or that we got requests from parents

1112
01:18:44,663 --> 01:18:46,745
[SPEAKER_01]: did receive a partial or full scholarship.

1113
01:18:47,145 --> 01:18:57,513
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to make sure that every student, no matter of their income or their parent's situation, has an opportunity to not miss out on all of this.

1114
01:18:57,633 --> 01:19:00,995
[SPEAKER_11]: Not only the educational piece, but the social piece as well.

1115
01:19:01,416 --> 01:19:02,797
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's very important.

1116
01:19:02,817 --> 01:19:04,958
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm very glad that you were able to meet that need.

1117
01:19:05,839 --> 01:19:07,060
[SPEAKER_11]: If that changes, just

1118
01:19:08,203 --> 01:19:10,344
[SPEAKER_11]: The mayor already said, you can ask her for money.

1119
01:19:10,364 --> 01:19:13,746
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

1120
01:19:14,426 --> 01:19:18,568
[SPEAKER_18]: If it would be okay to interject, Sherry and Michael have been working together, actually.

1121
01:19:19,028 --> 01:19:23,731
[SPEAKER_18]: When we had this number, we tried to do what we could do to combine

1122
01:19:24,845 --> 01:19:25,425
[SPEAKER_18]: both groups.

1123
01:19:25,566 --> 01:19:30,889
[SPEAKER_18]: I think going forward, I think it's going to be more that we're going to start together as a group.

1124
01:19:31,550 --> 01:19:36,073
[SPEAKER_18]: Andrews and McGlynn, I think we should just call it a middle school New York City trip.

1125
01:19:36,093 --> 01:19:41,877
[SPEAKER_18]: Not just the Andrews, not just the McGlynn, it should be the middle school trip.

1126
01:19:42,037 --> 01:19:45,620
[SPEAKER_18]: So I just wanted to let you know that, that we tried to work together.

1127
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:48,442
[SPEAKER_18]: We really worked hard as much as we could.

1128
01:19:49,604 --> 01:19:50,885
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, hotels got booked.

1129
01:19:50,905 --> 01:19:54,549
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a lot that goes behind the scenes that involve a lot of things.

1130
01:19:55,029 --> 01:20:09,083
[SPEAKER_18]: But I think if we come together early, we're talking October next year, and we all come together, we have the same meeting, we have the same meeting with parents, we discuss everything, I think that should alleviate a lot of the other inequities of numbers.

1131
01:20:10,502 --> 01:20:14,304
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that kind of answers part of my question.

1132
01:20:15,045 --> 01:20:16,606
[SPEAKER_22]: How much is the McGlynn trip this year?

1133
01:20:16,886 --> 01:20:19,727
[SPEAKER_01]: So ours is slightly, this is something that's a little bit different.

1134
01:20:19,768 --> 01:20:23,410
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have per kid, it's total, all in is 580.

1135
01:20:24,390 --> 01:20:29,253
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did have to increase the cost of the trip because the bus situation.

1136
01:20:29,593 --> 01:20:34,336
[SPEAKER_01]: So this happened last year as well, and we were able to keep it down.

1137
01:20:34,656 --> 01:20:35,957
[SPEAKER_01]: But this year we had

1138
01:20:36,688 --> 01:20:39,069
[SPEAKER_01]: too many kids for one bus.

1139
01:20:39,289 --> 01:20:43,552
[SPEAKER_01]: And once you add a whole second bus, that's a huge expense.

1140
01:20:44,392 --> 01:20:51,916
[SPEAKER_01]: And because we couldn't say kids could not go, we couldn't cap the number, we ended up with 57.

1141
01:20:52,396 --> 01:20:54,137
[SPEAKER_01]: And the largest bus you can get is a 45, 46 passenger.

1142
01:20:54,197 --> 01:20:54,778
[SPEAKER_01]: And last year, we

1143
01:20:59,841 --> 01:21:05,423
[SPEAKER_01]: It just worked where we had every single seat on that bus full and we were able to keep the cost down.

1144
01:21:05,783 --> 01:21:07,863
[SPEAKER_01]: And that just wasn't an option this year.

1145
01:21:08,464 --> 01:21:13,925
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really did make it hard because I did have to go back to the families and ask for increase.

1146
01:21:14,285 --> 01:21:19,547
[SPEAKER_01]: So we ended up being slightly more than the Andrews this year due to that, unfortunately.

1147
01:21:20,174 --> 01:21:26,697
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, it's not for anything else other than the bus is the most expensive part of this trip.

1148
01:21:27,558 --> 01:21:30,019
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just couldn't avoid that cost, unfortunately.

1149
01:21:30,279 --> 01:21:33,181
[SPEAKER_13]: So will you balance out the buses with both schools?

1150
01:21:33,421 --> 01:21:33,661
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1151
01:21:33,721 --> 01:21:34,701
[SPEAKER_01]: So next year we will do that.

1152
01:21:34,721 --> 01:21:35,682
[SPEAKER_01]: You won't have one bus operator.

1153
01:21:35,702 --> 01:21:35,862
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

1154
01:21:35,962 --> 01:21:39,584
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we tried to do this year at the beginning when we started to see the numbers.

1155
01:21:39,684 --> 01:21:44,446
[SPEAKER_01]: But then we couldn't stay at the same hotel, so we couldn't have the same buses.

1156
01:21:44,486 --> 01:21:45,687
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just ran into

1157
01:21:46,123 --> 01:21:47,724
[SPEAKER_01]: We hit a wall this year, unfortunately.

1158
01:21:48,104 --> 01:21:50,866
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I think next year it's going to be much better to plan together.

1159
01:21:50,926 --> 01:21:52,447
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we won't have any of these issues.

1160
01:21:52,587 --> 01:21:53,567
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.

1161
01:21:54,768 --> 01:21:54,908
[SPEAKER_22]: Ms.

1162
01:21:54,948 --> 01:21:55,408
[SPEAKER_22]: Vandiver.

1163
01:21:55,709 --> 01:22:05,674
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, no, just I think that ultimately taking that step also so that the kids then get to meet each other before they go on to high school, you know, and there will be familiar faces.

1164
01:22:05,994 --> 01:22:07,635
[SPEAKER_22]: So clearly that is the progression.

1165
01:22:08,456 --> 01:22:11,278
[SPEAKER_22]: I hope the kids and the chaperones have a wonderful time.

1166
01:22:11,838 --> 01:22:12,098
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1167
01:22:15,981 --> 01:22:18,183
[SPEAKER_13]: We always take chaperones.

1168
01:22:18,323 --> 01:22:19,944
[SPEAKER_13]: We always take chaperones.

1169
01:22:19,984 --> 01:22:22,646
[SPEAKER_22]: We kind of like to go.

1170
01:22:22,987 --> 01:22:24,368
[SPEAKER_13]: Not to put you on the spot.

1171
01:22:24,408 --> 01:22:33,114
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a motion before us, recommendation that the Medford School Committee approve the middle school New York City field trip to take place June 8th through 10th.

1172
01:22:33,194 --> 01:22:34,495
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a motion for approval?

1173
01:22:34,975 --> 01:22:36,437
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Russo, seconded by Ms.

1174
01:22:36,477 --> 01:22:36,777
[SPEAKER_13]: Kretz.

1175
01:22:37,357 --> 01:22:38,118
[SPEAKER_13]: Roll call vote, please.

1176
01:22:48,237 --> 01:22:48,458
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1177
01:22:48,518 --> 01:22:49,999
[SPEAKER_13]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1178
01:22:50,039 --> 01:22:50,719
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

1179
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:51,620
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1180
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:53,041
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

1181
01:22:53,101 --> 01:22:53,502
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1182
01:22:57,545 --> 01:23:00,367
[SPEAKER_13]: Report on early release professional development, March 21st.

1183
01:23:00,427 --> 01:23:00,767
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

1184
01:23:01,348 --> 01:23:01,728
[SPEAKER_13]: Nelson.

1185
01:23:02,168 --> 01:23:11,536
[SPEAKER_05]: Wednesday, March 21st is one of our mandated half day professional development for all schools, elementary, middle and high school.

1186
01:23:12,620 --> 01:23:17,723
[SPEAKER_05]: And this day is actually a postponement from February 7th, which was canceled because of weather.

1187
01:23:18,224 --> 01:23:22,907
[SPEAKER_05]: We let people go home at the end of this, the actual half day of school.

1188
01:23:23,967 --> 01:23:38,677
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, as we were planning for this day, we did have plans for the 7th of February, but given the situation with the community wanting to know and the teachers wanting to know more about the ALICE protocol, we've arranged for that half day of PD to be dedicated

1189
01:23:39,175 --> 01:23:44,317
[SPEAKER_05]: to a presentation of Alice and the police department will be coming in.

1190
01:23:45,038 --> 01:23:49,139
[SPEAKER_05]: They will be actually, the middle school and high school will be together at the high school.

1191
01:23:49,620 --> 01:23:54,022
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll have an hour presentation from quarter of one to quarter of two.

1192
01:23:54,622 --> 01:24:03,646
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we have breakout groups arranged where the teachers will go into smaller groups and discuss what they've learned about the protocols,

1193
01:24:04,093 --> 01:24:07,456
[SPEAKER_05]: and give us some feedback as to how to move forward with this.

1194
01:24:08,256 --> 01:24:26,791
[SPEAKER_05]: The elementary teachers will be coming into the high school at two o'clock, and they will have the same presentation, again, by the police department from two to three, and then they will remain three to four, which is their schedule, for a Q&A session with the police department.

1195
01:24:26,831 --> 01:24:33,677
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's our plan to get started with the ALICE, to get feedback from teachers, because we think this is important, too, to hear

1196
01:24:34,127 --> 01:24:38,330
[SPEAKER_05]: what people are thinking about it and how they would like to move forward with the trainings.

1197
01:24:38,650 --> 01:24:41,432
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a very extensive training as we're learning more about it.

1198
01:24:41,472 --> 01:24:48,557
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a full day and a half, which probably will, again, if it's going to be for all teachers, will have to be during the mandated days.

1199
01:24:49,558 --> 01:24:52,500
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, it's something that has to be repeated every year.

1200
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:55,462
[SPEAKER_05]: So I know we have a professional development committee.

1201
01:24:55,982 --> 01:25:03,047
[SPEAKER_05]: If we are gonna move forward with this, they have to understand that this is a priority and that as much as we would like to

1202
01:25:03,847 --> 01:25:09,291
[SPEAKER_05]: do everything they want us to do, that if we go forward with this, we have to dedicate the time for this.

1203
01:25:10,812 --> 01:25:11,012
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

1204
01:25:11,032 --> 01:25:11,433
[SPEAKER_13]: Mastone.

1205
01:25:11,453 --> 01:25:29,026
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to share with people at home that the Medfit Community Coalition had emailed the school committee and other members in central administration about suggestions they had for communication and safety.

1206
01:25:29,086 --> 01:25:33,249
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just want to clarify for them that one of their suggestions was

1207
01:25:34,478 --> 01:25:42,460
[SPEAKER_04]: to find out if a training was happening with Alice, what's hopefully the timeline so we can say hopefully a professional development day in the near future.

1208
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:45,180
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is just a short one.

1209
01:25:45,380 --> 01:25:47,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, an intro is March 21st and then further on.

1210
01:25:48,801 --> 01:25:57,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Their other suggestion was about the safety advisory committee that we had spoken about that is going to fall under the building and grounds subcommittee, which I chair.

1211
01:25:57,962 --> 01:26:00,623
[SPEAKER_04]: And we did set a date, thank God, for Doodle.

1212
01:26:01,195 --> 01:26:09,882
[SPEAKER_04]: So our safety advisory committee first meeting will be Thursday night, March 22nd from 7 to 9 at the superintendent's office.

1213
01:26:09,902 --> 01:26:11,163
[SPEAKER_04]: It will be posted tomorrow.

1214
01:26:11,524 --> 01:26:12,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone is welcome to attend.

1215
01:26:15,087 --> 01:26:24,074
[SPEAKER_04]: And then their other suggestion was just having streamlined communication, which is something that is being addressed and working on with central administration.

1216
01:26:24,234 --> 01:26:28,398
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want to thank the Method Community Coalition for giving us those great suggestions.

1217
01:26:28,914 --> 01:26:36,116
[SPEAKER_13]: And all the principals have been invited to this meeting on security, and also the president of the Teachers Association was notified as well.

1218
01:26:36,256 --> 01:26:36,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1219
01:26:36,656 --> 01:26:37,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1220
01:26:37,116 --> 01:26:38,896
[SPEAKER_13]: Along with people in administration.

1221
01:26:40,276 --> 01:26:40,797
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Ms.

1222
01:26:40,957 --> 01:26:42,457
[SPEAKER_13]: Mustone, for calling that so quickly.

1223
01:26:43,957 --> 01:26:45,217
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, Mr. Ruggiero.

1224
01:26:47,018 --> 01:26:47,718
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mayor Burke.

1225
01:26:48,038 --> 01:26:49,418
[SPEAKER_16]: I just have one question.

1226
01:26:49,478 --> 01:26:56,860
[SPEAKER_16]: So I wanted to know, and maybe Member Mustone explained this, but I just wanted to know would

1227
01:26:57,419 --> 01:27:02,981
[SPEAKER_16]: parents be able to also get an introductory meeting like what Alice is and why it's important and why we're choosing this?

1228
01:27:03,422 --> 01:27:04,082
[SPEAKER_16]: That is a good question.

1229
01:27:04,102 --> 01:27:06,303
[SPEAKER_13]: Could be separately, not on this day.

1230
01:27:06,763 --> 01:27:12,505
[SPEAKER_16]: Is it possible I'd like to make a motion that we pursue a community event because a number of parents have been asking me this very question.

1231
01:27:13,146 --> 01:27:19,649
[SPEAKER_16]: So we can actually have a full forum on what Alice is, why we're moving toward it, and why we think it's important for the city.

1232
01:27:20,949 --> 01:27:21,689
[SPEAKER_16]: Can someone second that?

1233
01:27:21,789 --> 01:27:22,370
[SPEAKER_04]: I can second it.

1234
01:27:22,470 --> 01:27:22,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

1235
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:35,303
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion as seconded that a meeting be held with parents to give them a higher ratio Alice Training from my medical police department all those in favor.

1236
01:27:35,704 --> 01:27:53,930
[SPEAKER_13]: I was opposed that motion passes On the on the early professional professional day Mr. Russo so if we would have to do one and a half days annually to keep everybody fully trained how many

1237
01:27:55,021 --> 01:27:57,383
[SPEAKER_15]: professional development days do we have a year?

1238
01:27:58,303 --> 01:27:59,864
[SPEAKER_05]: We have two full days.

1239
01:28:00,845 --> 01:28:13,674
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we have, there are built into the calendar several middle school and high school early release days, and the elementary have early release every Wednesday.

1240
01:28:14,275 --> 01:28:21,600
[SPEAKER_05]: The mandated days, the way we worked it out with the contract, the past contract, now this could change as we're negotiating a new contract.

1241
01:28:22,327 --> 01:28:28,789
[SPEAKER_05]: is that I believe there are four mandated days out of the 12 early release days for the middle and high school.

1242
01:28:29,429 --> 01:28:32,710
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, we have some half days, four right now.

1243
01:28:33,290 --> 01:28:46,073
[SPEAKER_05]: I think as we move forward in contract negotiations, we may need to look for more PD time if we're going to be doing this kind of training and then we want to acknowledge some of the other trainings the teachers might want in addition.

1244
01:28:46,813 --> 01:28:49,995
[SPEAKER_05]: This might be something moving forward in the contract we might want to get.

1245
01:28:50,235 --> 01:28:57,580
[SPEAKER_05]: But right now, it's two full days, four mandated PD days for middle and high school.

1246
01:28:58,541 --> 01:29:01,663
[SPEAKER_05]: Elementary mandated is also four, I believe, Diane.

1247
01:29:02,083 --> 01:29:02,643
[SPEAKER_05]: Or do you want to?

1248
01:29:02,923 --> 01:29:08,787
[SPEAKER_07]: They're only two two-hour segments, so it's not like a full day of PD they have.

1249
01:29:08,807 --> 01:29:08,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

1250
01:29:08,987 --> 01:29:09,928
[SPEAKER_05]: The middle and high school, too.

1251
01:29:09,988 --> 01:29:10,648
[SPEAKER_05]: It's two hours.

1252
01:29:12,169 --> 01:29:14,471
[SPEAKER_05]: And so again, that's what we have right now.

1253
01:29:17,583 --> 01:29:33,573
[SPEAKER_15]: considering using the majority of professional development on something that is virtually, like the likelihood is incredibly low and will thus delay RTI and all the other trainings that we want to do which will affect our children right away.

1254
01:29:33,593 --> 01:29:37,016
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we're going to have to get creative.

1255
01:29:37,256 --> 01:29:38,797
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we haven't decided that.

1256
01:29:38,897 --> 01:29:44,601
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we basically, we want to see how the teachers, many of them are learning about this for the very first time.

1257
01:29:44,981 --> 01:29:46,822
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is why we want the sessions where

1258
01:29:47,105 --> 01:29:48,286
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to have some discussion.

1259
01:29:48,326 --> 01:29:58,371
[SPEAKER_05]: We also have developed an online survey that they're going to be taking at the end of the day to give us additional feedback, because obviously we can't do all of that in two hours.

1260
01:29:58,691 --> 01:30:00,992
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we have to make decisions on moving forward.

1261
01:30:01,573 --> 01:30:03,274
[SPEAKER_05]: If we can get more time, that's great.

1262
01:30:03,494 --> 01:30:06,695
[SPEAKER_05]: If we can't, how are we going to allocate that time for PD?

1263
01:30:07,376 --> 01:30:15,260
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want to make sure we're not going to say, if Alice's training, which is what we're going with,

1264
01:30:15,902 --> 01:30:18,784
[SPEAKER_15]: is one and a half days a year of training.

1265
01:30:19,205 --> 01:30:24,289
[SPEAKER_15]: We're not going to just wave a magic wand and give it a couple hours a year and think that's enough.

1266
01:30:24,449 --> 01:30:35,838
[SPEAKER_15]: So if we have to give up most of our professional development for all of our teachers, for all of the things that we currently do, I think the community really needs to understand and make a choice.

1267
01:30:39,341 --> 01:30:40,842
[SPEAKER_13]: We are in negotiations as well.

1268
01:30:41,042 --> 01:30:43,624
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's moving pieces that are happening.

1269
01:30:45,086 --> 01:30:45,366
[SPEAKER_22]: Hands?

1270
01:30:47,098 --> 01:30:47,198
[SPEAKER_22]: Ms.

1271
01:30:47,238 --> 01:30:47,698
[SPEAKER_22]: Vandekloot.

1272
01:30:48,159 --> 01:30:52,881
[SPEAKER_22]: So I too was surprised to hear how long this training was.

1273
01:30:53,801 --> 01:31:03,065
[SPEAKER_22]: At my workplace, Winchester Hospital, just up the road, Winchester police came in and did run, hide, fight.

1274
01:31:03,166 --> 01:31:05,507
[SPEAKER_22]: And those are the three words that you use, run, hide, fight.

1275
01:31:06,727 --> 01:31:09,188
[SPEAKER_22]: And it seemed much more targeted and concise.

1276
01:31:09,569 --> 01:31:13,490
[SPEAKER_22]: I personally will be speaking with Officer Convino so I understand the differences.

1277
01:31:14,371 --> 01:31:16,372
[SPEAKER_22]: And we might also

1278
01:31:17,325 --> 01:31:24,709
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know if he's planning on coming to your subcommittee meeting, but if not, perhaps he could come to another one.

1279
01:31:25,049 --> 01:31:35,615
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway, just because we've been using Alice because it's kind of been the original catch word, but I'm not sure that's the only approach, whatever.

1280
01:31:35,695 --> 01:31:41,658
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm a little puzzled about the time commitment, because it does seem extensive.

1281
01:31:42,018 --> 01:31:46,561
[SPEAKER_22]: I also wondered whether Officer Covino has, for Rennheide Fight, we have

1282
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:51,602
[SPEAKER_22]: there's a movie, which is maybe 15 minutes long.

1283
01:31:52,243 --> 01:31:54,884
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a video that I know that's part of the presentation.

1284
01:31:54,944 --> 01:32:01,707
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I think if there's a way for the committee to access that video so we can see it too, would be very useful.

1285
01:32:01,867 --> 01:32:06,209
[SPEAKER_22]: So I will reach out to him myself to ask my questions around it.

1286
01:32:06,889 --> 01:32:08,530
[SPEAKER_22]: But maybe if he could be included.

1287
01:32:08,550 --> 01:32:13,913
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess we'll find out more once we go through training.

1288
01:32:14,033 --> 01:32:16,154
[SPEAKER_04]: But a friend of mine works in a different district.

1289
01:32:16,923 --> 01:32:19,865
[SPEAKER_04]: She was only trained once for ALICE.

1290
01:32:20,525 --> 01:32:23,227
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's almost, I don't think you'd have to use a professional development.

1291
01:32:23,987 --> 01:32:28,569
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be for new hires, maybe during their new hire orientation, they would be trained for ALICE.

1292
01:32:29,210 --> 01:32:30,591
[SPEAKER_04]: She was trained once three years ago.

1293
01:32:30,611 --> 01:32:31,491
[SPEAKER_04]: She's still a teacher.

1294
01:32:31,531 --> 01:32:36,514
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know if it's something that you have to be trained, it's the same training year after year.

1295
01:32:37,114 --> 01:32:38,415
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's something we can look into.

1296
01:32:38,475 --> 01:32:42,677
[SPEAKER_04]: So it might not be, it could be part of that week of orientation for new teachers.

1297
01:32:44,765 --> 01:32:48,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I don't, but we'll have to clarify if you have to be retrained every year.

1298
01:32:48,866 --> 01:32:49,246
[SPEAKER_11]: Very good.

1299
01:32:49,826 --> 01:32:50,527
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Benedetto.

1300
01:32:51,627 --> 01:32:52,947
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to pass it this time.

1301
01:32:52,987 --> 01:32:54,608
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of my questions have been asked.

1302
01:32:55,208 --> 01:32:55,588
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1303
01:32:56,308 --> 01:32:56,768
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Ruggiero.

1304
01:32:56,788 --> 01:33:00,329
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I just have a question about professional development days in general.

1305
01:33:00,749 --> 01:33:05,351
[SPEAKER_16]: So you would, usually the different topics be scheduled in advance.

1306
01:33:05,371 --> 01:33:08,332
[SPEAKER_16]: It was just because of the current situation that we decided to move this up.

1307
01:33:08,412 --> 01:33:08,992
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that correct?

1308
01:33:09,052 --> 01:33:09,332
[SPEAKER_16]: Correct.

1309
01:33:10,464 --> 01:33:21,450
[SPEAKER_16]: So in terms of the ALICE program, I just wanted to know a little bit about how the decision was made to move forward with ALICE versus like these other programs that we're mentioning.

1310
01:33:23,131 --> 01:33:25,332
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, that was part of it.

1311
01:33:25,592 --> 01:33:33,697
[SPEAKER_13]: It was requested that we look into it and this is the first opportunity to display it back to the teachers so they get an understanding of it and then determine whether or not

1312
01:33:34,141 --> 01:33:37,522
[SPEAKER_13]: between the police station, which the police department's fully supportive of this.

1313
01:33:38,523 --> 01:33:39,763
[SPEAKER_13]: So to balance it out.

1314
01:33:39,943 --> 01:33:44,305
[SPEAKER_16]: So we know that the Medford PD fully approves this program the most?

1315
01:33:44,325 --> 01:33:44,425
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1316
01:33:44,445 --> 01:33:44,805
[SPEAKER_16]: OK, thank you.

1317
01:33:44,825 --> 01:33:46,146
[SPEAKER_16]: That helps me understand the situation.

1318
01:33:46,166 --> 01:33:46,366
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1319
01:33:46,386 --> 01:33:51,528
[SPEAKER_04]: So the meeting when you were in Colorado, the chief supported it.

1320
01:33:51,688 --> 01:33:55,129
[SPEAKER_04]: A young man who was an EMT spoke about it.

1321
01:33:55,289 --> 01:34:01,791
[SPEAKER_04]: And a mother of three children who professionally is an ALICE trainer spoke very eloquently about it.

1322
01:34:01,932 --> 01:34:02,972
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's how it came.

1323
01:34:03,996 --> 01:34:07,118
[SPEAKER_16]: I just wanted to clarify from my mindset.

1324
01:34:07,138 --> 01:34:07,678
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1325
01:34:08,578 --> 01:34:08,998
[SPEAKER_13]: Very good.

1326
01:34:11,059 --> 01:34:15,161
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a motion on the floor to accept this report and place it on file by Mr. Ruggiero, seconded by Ms.

1327
01:34:15,201 --> 01:34:15,701
[SPEAKER_13]: Van de Kloot.

1328
01:34:15,741 --> 01:34:16,442
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

1329
01:34:16,462 --> 01:34:16,522
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

1330
01:34:16,962 --> 01:34:17,622
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

1331
01:34:17,662 --> 01:34:18,443
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

1332
01:34:19,783 --> 01:34:21,924
[SPEAKER_13]: Report on pre-budget guidance department.

1333
01:34:22,304 --> 01:34:25,966
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, we're continuing on with our pre-budget reports.

1334
01:34:27,367 --> 01:34:28,187
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, we're still

1335
01:34:29,062 --> 01:34:30,662
[SPEAKER_05]: moving people in different slots.

1336
01:34:30,882 --> 01:34:38,044
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll try to give the schedule as soon as we have it actually finalized, but tonight we do have guidance.

1337
01:34:38,564 --> 01:34:39,984
[SPEAKER_05]: As you know, Ms.

1338
01:34:40,864 --> 01:34:49,525
[SPEAKER_05]: Jensen had her baby in November, little Agnes Olive, and she decided that she would like to stay home the rest of the year with her, so she's taken a leave of absence.

1339
01:34:50,066 --> 01:34:52,586
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've invited Mr. Howard to come back.

1340
01:34:52,626 --> 01:34:58,307
[SPEAKER_05]: We need a licensed guidance administrator, especially with the CPR going on this year, and Mr. Howard

1341
01:34:58,738 --> 01:35:02,840
[SPEAKER_05]: has come back in to help pick up with the guidance department, and Ms.

1342
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:15,787
[SPEAKER_05]: Glasser has really filled in wonderfully doing some of the extra work that Amelia was doing, and so between the two of them, and I think Tori did most of the work, they prepared this report for you on what their budget needs are.

1343
01:35:16,768 --> 01:35:21,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so Tori, thank you very much, and you can present what you are looking for.

1344
01:35:21,601 --> 01:35:25,022
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening, Mayor Burke, school committee members, and Deputy Superintendent Nelson.

1345
01:35:26,002 --> 01:35:31,144
[SPEAKER_06]: So the guidance department consists of 10 counselors, two at each middle school and six at the high school.

1346
01:35:33,344 --> 01:35:40,546
[SPEAKER_06]: This year was our first year fully integrating the counselors as both high school counselors and vocational.

1347
01:35:41,147 --> 01:35:49,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Alice Beth is now in C building with us, so all of the guidance counselors at the high school are together in C building.

1348
01:35:50,837 --> 01:36:04,802
[SPEAKER_06]: All of us have ninth grade students throughout the whole alphabet, so going forward, that will be the goal, will be that all of the counselors have students, whether they're in traditional academic tracks or vocational programs.

1349
01:36:06,643 --> 01:36:14,686
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the second year of us doing the credit recovery with students, so in 2016, the graduation rate was 83.9%, and in 2017, it went up to 90%, and so we're hoping for

1350
01:36:20,311 --> 01:36:23,034
[SPEAKER_06]: a high number such as that or if not higher this year.

1351
01:36:24,956 --> 01:36:33,364
[SPEAKER_06]: We have continued partnerships with Europe, Match Beyond, Rockland Trust, a lot of those.

1352
01:36:34,265 --> 01:36:42,132
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we're continuing to use the money that the district has graciously provided for the PSATs.

1353
01:36:42,172 --> 01:36:44,975
[SPEAKER_06]: So all of our juniors take the PSAT free of charge.

1354
01:36:45,745 --> 01:36:50,228
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's open to any sophomores that want to take it for the small fee of $15.

1355
01:36:51,569 --> 01:36:58,694
[SPEAKER_06]: So the funding that we're asking for is just pretty much the same as last year, just with one stipulation or change.

1356
01:36:59,314 --> 01:37:02,276
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't need any money for textbooks this year.

1357
01:37:02,816 --> 01:37:13,403
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're asking for that $1,000 that was previously used for textbooks to be given to AP exams, particularly for students that are on free or reduced lunch.

1358
01:37:14,774 --> 01:37:20,136
[SPEAKER_06]: The fee, which is $53 for students on free or reduced lunch, can still be a barrier.

1359
01:37:20,316 --> 01:37:22,336
[SPEAKER_06]: Students normally pay $94.

1360
01:37:23,317 --> 01:37:36,140
[SPEAKER_06]: So even that $53, we've noticed some students are not signing up or maybe not even choosing to take the course because that fee would stand between them and taking the test.

1361
01:37:38,021 --> 01:37:38,341
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1362
01:37:38,361 --> 01:37:39,822
[SPEAKER_13]: Are there any questions from the body?

1363
01:37:40,842 --> 01:37:41,582
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Benedetto.

1364
01:37:41,762 --> 01:37:42,162
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1365
01:37:42,922 --> 01:37:44,363
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we have any data on?

1366
01:37:45,043 --> 01:37:52,166
[SPEAKER_11]: Since we started giving all students PSATs, how many more students are taking the SATs because they had that first opportunity?

1367
01:37:53,987 --> 01:38:05,852
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't think we have a number on the number of taking the SATs, but we certainly have a large increase with the PSAT, which is primarily for the SAT.

1368
01:38:05,992 --> 01:38:09,373
[SPEAKER_03]: We've just recently gotten into that, but we will have those results.

1369
01:38:10,914 --> 01:38:11,554
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

1370
01:38:11,654 --> 01:38:13,655
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's a great opportunity because

1371
01:38:15,398 --> 01:38:36,925
[SPEAKER_11]: that we're offering to all children now to take those PSATs so they're less frightened of taking the SAT and it builds their confidence and they always do better when they have that practice time and I know some other districts have done that for years and I'm very pleased that we're offering that.

1372
01:38:38,506 --> 01:38:44,488
[SPEAKER_11]: I think your budget, it looks great and the idea of using your

1373
01:38:45,775 --> 01:38:48,956
[SPEAKER_11]: What you received last year in a different way is good.

1374
01:38:49,076 --> 01:38:57,340
[SPEAKER_11]: I do see the increase for the AP studies and any opportunity that our children has to, because we complete globally now.

1375
01:38:57,400 --> 01:39:03,482
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't just complete with people from Massachusetts or our neighboring districts.

1376
01:39:03,522 --> 01:39:06,323
[SPEAKER_11]: Kids that are going up at Tufts, they're from all over the world.

1377
01:39:06,723 --> 01:39:13,066
[SPEAKER_11]: And if our kids are going to get there, they have to take those higher end classes, and they have to pass some of those exams.

1378
01:39:13,543 --> 01:39:18,086
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm more than happy to approve this motion for later.

1379
01:39:21,528 --> 01:39:22,089
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, sorry.

1380
01:39:22,169 --> 01:39:23,450
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep, there's many questions.

1381
01:39:24,190 --> 01:39:24,650
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm rushing it.

1382
01:39:24,711 --> 01:39:24,791
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

1383
01:39:24,851 --> 01:39:25,071
[SPEAKER_04]: Stone?

1384
01:39:25,091 --> 01:39:25,671
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

1385
01:39:25,791 --> 01:39:26,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1386
01:39:26,452 --> 01:39:38,780
[SPEAKER_04]: On the second to last page, just the last sentence, just as we think of pre-budgets, it says, while there are school adjustment counselors at the elementary level, there may be the need for additional guidance counselors at that level as well.

1387
01:39:39,480 --> 01:39:43,023
[SPEAKER_04]: So is that recommending guidance counselors for elementary schools?

1388
01:39:43,713 --> 01:39:44,574
[SPEAKER_06]: It is in the future.

1389
01:39:44,674 --> 01:39:50,178
[SPEAKER_06]: At this moment, neither myself or Mr. Howard were comfortable speaking for Amelia in that role.

1390
01:39:50,258 --> 01:39:57,744
[SPEAKER_06]: But I know many districts, Peabody, Lexington, it is becoming a growing trend to have school counselors at the elementary level.

1391
01:39:58,364 --> 01:40:06,230
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know we at the Roberts have an adjustment counselor that is great and works nonstop.

1392
01:40:06,750 --> 01:40:09,893
[SPEAKER_04]: So she does the social, emotional well-being part.

1393
01:40:10,053 --> 01:40:13,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you suggesting a guidance council for elementary for more academic part?

1394
01:40:14,217 --> 01:40:15,138
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just not sure.

1395
01:40:15,298 --> 01:40:16,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to think of staffing.

1396
01:40:18,201 --> 01:40:23,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically for socialization and for family situations.

1397
01:40:25,248 --> 01:40:31,832
[SPEAKER_03]: The adjustment counselors do a fine job, but I believe that the guidance counselors are the first line of defense.

1398
01:40:32,292 --> 01:40:44,579
[SPEAKER_03]: And what happens is we live in a society today where the homes, there are some dysfunctional situations and the students come to school many times not fed properly or dressed properly and so forth.

1399
01:40:44,699 --> 01:40:46,701
[SPEAKER_03]: And we want to catch it at the early stages.

1400
01:40:46,721 --> 01:40:50,063
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we get to the ninth grade or the middle school level,

1401
01:40:51,203 --> 01:40:53,244
[SPEAKER_03]: we can have that profit.

1402
01:40:53,384 --> 01:40:55,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Does the high school have adjustment counselors?

1403
01:40:55,625 --> 01:40:56,145
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1404
01:40:56,225 --> 01:40:57,786
[SPEAKER_06]: We do, but not nearly enough.

1405
01:40:58,806 --> 01:41:01,707
[SPEAKER_04]: And who does the adjustment counselors, what department does it fall under?

1406
01:41:01,727 --> 01:41:02,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Special education.

1407
01:41:02,687 --> 01:41:02,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1408
01:41:03,248 --> 01:41:04,928
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's another budget that we'll hear about.

1409
01:41:05,669 --> 01:41:12,951
[SPEAKER_06]: And also just on that note, at the elementary level, a lot of times the adjustment counselor might only see students that are on a 504 or an IE.

1410
01:41:13,091 --> 01:41:13,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1411
01:41:13,532 --> 01:41:15,372
[SPEAKER_06]: So a guidance counselor is charged with serving all students.

1412
01:41:15,392 --> 01:41:15,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody.

1413
01:41:15,792 --> 01:41:16,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1414
01:41:16,673 --> 01:41:17,253
[SPEAKER_05]: That's good to know.

1415
01:41:17,909 --> 01:41:18,089
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1416
01:41:18,149 --> 01:41:18,549
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1417
01:41:18,649 --> 01:41:24,912
[SPEAKER_05]: And if I could add to, um, you know, I, when I went to my license as a guidance counselor, it was really college and career stuff.

1418
01:41:25,453 --> 01:41:27,594
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really more, more social and emotional.

1419
01:41:28,094 --> 01:41:29,535
[SPEAKER_05]: Their, their responsibilities.

1420
01:41:29,575 --> 01:41:42,001
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think Tori put this in her report that the American school counselors association talk about the responsibilities of guidance counselors being academic college and career, but personal and social development.

1421
01:41:42,441 --> 01:41:42,601
[SPEAKER_05]: So,

1422
01:41:43,252 --> 01:41:48,096
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, the school adjustment counselor role and the guidance counselor's role are kind of intersecting.

1423
01:41:48,576 --> 01:41:54,460
[SPEAKER_05]: And so whether we have more guidance counselors or adjustment counselors, there's the need for that domain to be addressed.

1424
01:41:54,761 --> 01:41:55,281
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1425
01:41:57,402 --> 01:41:59,064
[SPEAKER_03]: If I could just make a statement.

1426
01:42:00,505 --> 01:42:04,948
[SPEAKER_03]: On Tori Glasser, just so people know, she's going into her ninth year.

1427
01:42:05,889 --> 01:42:09,251
[SPEAKER_03]: And recently, Amelia

1428
01:42:12,260 --> 01:42:19,468
[SPEAKER_03]: guidance director gave her additional work to do to make her head towards her guidance director certification.

1429
01:42:20,133 --> 01:42:27,336
[SPEAKER_03]: I recently signed off on that because she has been working with me as well and has been submitted to the Department of Education.

1430
01:42:28,017 --> 01:42:31,738
[SPEAKER_03]: And just to give her a little background, she just taught a class at Salem State tonight.

1431
01:42:31,758 --> 01:42:33,559
[SPEAKER_03]: She teaches one class over there.

1432
01:42:33,579 --> 01:42:41,422
[SPEAKER_03]: She's a past president of our school counselors and she's also an active member of the American Association of School Counselors.

1433
01:42:42,043 --> 01:42:47,525
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and I just wanted to mention that we do have another high school counselor who's been out three weeks now.

1434
01:42:47,565 --> 01:42:49,446
[SPEAKER_03]: She just had a baby, Crystal Normandy.

1435
01:42:50,366 --> 01:42:55,395
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are running a little shorthand, but I think we're doing really nicely.

1436
01:42:56,056 --> 01:43:02,367
[SPEAKER_03]: And Tori is the head counselor, and eventually she'll be a guidance director somewhere.

1437
01:43:05,199 --> 01:43:06,681
[SPEAKER_05]: And Mr. Howard's her agent.

1438
01:43:06,701 --> 01:43:07,702
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Howard.

1439
01:43:07,782 --> 01:43:10,264
[SPEAKER_03]: He's her agent.

1440
01:43:10,624 --> 01:43:11,706
[SPEAKER_03]: It's 10% cut, yeah.

1441
01:43:12,086 --> 01:43:18,132
[SPEAKER_03]: But also, I would just like to mention the mayor's office sent somebody down to the high school regarding a scholarship.

1442
01:43:18,712 --> 01:43:23,457
[SPEAKER_03]: We already have students accepted to Harvard, to the Tufts, Boston College.

1443
01:43:23,477 --> 01:43:23,878
[SPEAKER_06]: UCLA today?

1444
01:43:24,698 --> 01:43:33,344
[SPEAKER_03]: UCLA, okay, so we're doing very well, UMaine, UNH, UMass Amherst, and so forth.

1445
01:43:33,965 --> 01:43:44,372
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, for all practical purposes, we're doing well, but from the mayor's office, one of her friends came to see us at the high school.

1446
01:43:45,232 --> 01:43:54,156
[SPEAKER_03]: And Thelma and James Conner Scholarship, for the immediate area, they're offering $53,000 scholarships.

1447
01:43:54,856 --> 01:43:58,378
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just wanted you to know at the present time, we have 51 applicants.

1448
01:43:58,518 --> 01:43:59,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.

1449
01:43:59,639 --> 01:44:00,219
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good.

1450
01:44:00,899 --> 01:44:03,701
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think we're on target to do the right thing.

1451
01:44:04,481 --> 01:44:15,568
[SPEAKER_03]: We met with Middlesex Federal Bank Friday, and they're giving us three $1,000 scholarships, and we're in the process of streamlining their application process.

1452
01:44:16,708 --> 01:44:18,590
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been very nice to us.

1453
01:44:18,870 --> 01:44:19,290
[SPEAKER_13]: Excellent.

1454
01:44:19,330 --> 01:44:19,670
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1455
01:44:19,990 --> 01:44:20,671
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Rousseau.

1456
01:44:21,851 --> 01:44:22,612
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much.

1457
01:44:22,672 --> 01:44:23,753
[SPEAKER_15]: That was a lot of information.

1458
01:44:28,391 --> 01:44:43,158
[SPEAKER_15]: I was wondering, because I was confused about the fact that the elementary schools do not have the guidance counselors, for the middle schools and for the high school, what is the guidance counselor to student ratios right now?

1459
01:44:43,298 --> 01:44:45,079
[SPEAKER_15]: About 300 on average.

1460
01:44:45,499 --> 01:44:47,260
[SPEAKER_15]: That's not terrible.

1461
01:44:48,460 --> 01:44:49,160
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it varies.

1462
01:44:49,180 --> 01:44:50,601
[SPEAKER_06]: It's anywhere from 250 to 320.

1463
01:44:52,102 --> 01:44:52,422
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

1464
01:44:52,922 --> 01:44:56,984
[SPEAKER_15]: I was just looking on the, I don't know which Department of Ed website,

1465
01:44:57,628 --> 01:45:06,716
[SPEAKER_15]: showed us in the 420 range, but I think that might have been including students that are in elementary school or something was weird about that.

1466
01:45:06,796 --> 01:45:08,238
[SPEAKER_15]: So this number is much nicer.

1467
01:45:08,258 --> 01:45:11,681
[SPEAKER_15]: I have one other question, though, about the, so the additional $1,000

1468
01:45:14,205 --> 01:45:15,867
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that enough or do you know?

1469
01:45:16,087 --> 01:45:16,867
[SPEAKER_06]: You want me to be honest?

1470
01:45:17,008 --> 01:45:17,148
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1471
01:45:17,168 --> 01:45:23,573
[SPEAKER_06]: $2,000 would cover the fees of all the students on free or reduced lunch taking AP tests totally.

1472
01:45:24,354 --> 01:45:30,199
[SPEAKER_06]: If it was only $1,000, we were looking to cover the additional tests past that first one.

1473
01:45:30,579 --> 01:45:37,425
[SPEAKER_06]: But I did the numbers and in 2017, it would have been a total of 29 tests for $53, so $15.37.

1474
01:45:41,348 --> 01:45:48,219
[SPEAKER_06]: In 2018, we have an increase of students on a pre-reduced lunch taking AP, so 14% as compared to 10, and it would be $18,055.

1475
01:45:50,465 --> 01:45:51,725
[SPEAKER_13]: Would you like to amend your report?

1476
01:45:53,826 --> 01:46:06,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Since this is your... Keeping in mind, we do have 15 AP classes offered at the high school, and certainly we would encourage each of those students to take an AP class to take the advanced placement exam.

1477
01:46:06,168 --> 01:46:10,328
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a motion on the floor to amend that report to be 2,000 increases?

1478
01:46:10,508 --> 01:46:11,128
[SPEAKER_13]: So moved by Ms.

1479
01:46:11,148 --> 01:46:12,789
[SPEAKER_13]: Vandekloot, seconded by Mr. Russo.

1480
01:46:14,129 --> 01:46:14,309
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

1481
01:46:14,329 --> 01:46:14,929
[SPEAKER_22]: Vandekloot.

1482
01:46:15,429 --> 01:46:20,190
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, I just wanted to ask if you could recall when the deadline for the Connors scholarship is.

1483
01:46:20,848 --> 01:46:22,089
[SPEAKER_03]: It was February 28th.

1484
01:46:22,530 --> 01:46:23,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1485
01:46:23,571 --> 01:46:36,622
[SPEAKER_03]: But before that deadline, we made a massive push because somebody from the mayor's office came down to inform us and we made a push to all the students, the seniors, and we do have 51 applicants in.

1486
01:46:38,904 --> 01:46:39,445
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Ruggiero.

1487
01:46:40,128 --> 01:46:40,828
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, thank you.

1488
01:46:41,108 --> 01:46:42,369
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much for this report.

1489
01:46:42,969 --> 01:46:43,949
[SPEAKER_16]: I have a question for you guys.

1490
01:46:44,549 --> 01:46:53,311
[SPEAKER_16]: So do you, if there is someone in the community that has the ability, like a retired individual, would it be possible that they could help tutor kids in these AP classes?

1491
01:46:54,311 --> 01:46:56,672
[SPEAKER_16]: I've had a couple, when I was knocking on doors, reach out to me.

1492
01:46:56,692 --> 01:47:00,673
[SPEAKER_16]: They were retired professors of physics that might be interested.

1493
01:47:00,693 --> 01:47:05,114
[SPEAKER_16]: Or if you had someone in the community that was able to help out with tutoring, would you guys?

1494
01:47:06,094 --> 01:47:08,295
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be a policy that would have to be funded.

1495
01:47:11,696 --> 01:47:23,401
[SPEAKER_03]: If I could add though, the AP curriculum is very prescriptive.

1496
01:47:40,418 --> 01:47:50,186
[SPEAKER_05]: In order to be able to offer an AP course, the teacher teaching the course has to submit to the college board their actual curriculum for the year.

1497
01:47:50,206 --> 01:47:56,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Now certainly someone can come in and help out with some of the content of that, but the curriculum is kind of set.

1498
01:47:56,952 --> 01:48:04,398
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, if a teacher submits this curriculum to college board and they reject it, we cannot offer the course.

1499
01:48:04,738 --> 01:48:08,141
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have to be very careful about people just coming in and teaching AP.

1500
01:48:08,742 --> 01:48:14,066
[SPEAKER_05]: But certainly if they were working with the teacher who had the approved course, that would be something we could entertain.

1501
01:48:15,407 --> 01:48:20,251
[SPEAKER_16]: Could I ask the deputy superintendent to look into how we could create such a program?

1502
01:48:22,068 --> 01:48:22,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

1503
01:48:23,889 --> 01:48:24,850
[SPEAKER_05]: For the time I have left.

1504
01:48:24,870 --> 01:48:28,853
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's a good idea.

1505
01:48:29,533 --> 01:48:33,796
[SPEAKER_06]: Even if it wasn't for AP specifically, we have students, freshman students take physics.

1506
01:48:33,856 --> 01:48:35,578
[SPEAKER_06]: And some of them are really challenged by it.

1507
01:48:35,638 --> 01:48:46,145
[SPEAKER_06]: So as long as they were quarried and approved by the district, I think having a list of professors or people from the community that are willing to help, especially for free, would be an amazing resource.

1508
01:48:46,746 --> 01:48:49,327
[SPEAKER_16]: Perhaps we could look at something doing in collaboration with the library.

1509
01:48:50,696 --> 01:48:51,076
[SPEAKER_14]: Very good.

1510
01:48:51,977 --> 01:48:52,177
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

1511
01:48:52,197 --> 01:48:52,737
[SPEAKER_14]: Krex.

1512
01:48:52,978 --> 01:48:53,158
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1513
01:48:53,458 --> 01:48:54,459
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for the report.

1514
01:48:55,179 --> 01:49:03,065
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to know how the transition is going with the vocational students over centralized in the 1C building.

1515
01:49:03,865 --> 01:49:14,513
[SPEAKER_14]: I've just heard from some students and parents, the students who are in the vocational school getting over to the guidance council office, it's just a little farther of a distance.

1516
01:49:15,153 --> 01:49:17,815
[SPEAKER_14]: And where some of the students are on co-op,

1517
01:49:18,782 --> 01:49:46,553
[SPEAKER_14]: they're only in school like every other week, so I wanted to know if, and I don't know for sure, but if there's afternoon hours for the guidance, so that the students who are in the vocational side, where they have like the one week of academics, they really can't be kind of pulled from their classes to go down to the guidance, but they do want to participate in the scholarship programs, and they're getting ready for colleges and applications, and it does take some time, so I didn't know

1518
01:49:47,770 --> 01:49:52,171
[SPEAKER_14]: if there was any assistance or aids that help out with that process.

1519
01:49:52,871 --> 01:49:56,172
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that Alicebeth, I often see her leaving around four o'clock.

1520
01:49:56,232 --> 01:49:59,292
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll go for a run and she's with her kids.

1521
01:49:59,313 --> 01:50:06,274
[SPEAKER_06]: So she does stay late a lot of the times, particularly she has the vocational students that are juniors and seniors currently.

1522
01:50:07,314 --> 01:50:12,775
[SPEAKER_06]: But I have heard that there's some growing pains where her office used to be located there and now it's over by us.

1523
01:50:12,955 --> 01:50:15,596
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think as we transition and become one school,

1524
01:50:17,105 --> 01:50:20,246
[SPEAKER_06]: it's important for us all to be together so we can collaborate with her.

1525
01:50:21,187 --> 01:50:31,711
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, my office is right across from the bathroom, so if they wanted to look at moving us all to a new location in the middle, in general, I think it's important for us to be together, and the students are getting used to it.

1526
01:50:31,791 --> 01:50:40,174
[SPEAKER_06]: Plenty of times they'll come down, and if one of us aren't there, then they can ask someone else a question, so it is helpful for her not to necessarily be in isolation anymore.

1527
01:50:41,194 --> 01:50:44,976
[SPEAKER_14]: What about getting copies of the printed transcripts

1528
01:50:45,406 --> 01:50:51,068
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I know if you're going to be filling out a college application or scholarship, you have to get the official transcript.

1529
01:50:51,468 --> 01:51:01,111
[SPEAKER_14]: And I was just thinking it might be helpful if somebody else in the office, besides the guidance counselor or assigned counselor, could print them out for the students.

1530
01:51:01,171 --> 01:51:03,052
[SPEAKER_14]: But it would be an authorized person.

1531
01:51:03,112 --> 01:51:04,332
[SPEAKER_14]: Or Secretary Andre.

1532
01:51:04,752 --> 01:51:05,192
[SPEAKER_14]: Andre?

1533
01:51:05,332 --> 01:51:05,592
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

1534
01:51:06,413 --> 01:51:08,693
[SPEAKER_03]: If I may just add something.

1535
01:51:09,134 --> 01:51:12,575
[SPEAKER_03]: We have an exceptional secretary, Andre Pierre.

1536
01:51:14,868 --> 01:51:27,741
[SPEAKER_03]: She not only speaks French, which helps us with the Haitian population, she does the translation, she does the original transcript that is attached or sent off to the colleges and so forth.

1537
01:51:28,181 --> 01:51:35,169
[SPEAKER_03]: So she does a lot of work that is not visible, along with her secretarial duties.

1538
01:51:35,229 --> 01:51:37,150
[SPEAKER_03]: But she's a wonderful secretary.

1539
01:51:39,090 --> 01:51:50,715
[SPEAKER_14]: And then I just wanted to know, because I was reading in the report and I did get to talk to some of the guidance counselors at the high school and I think there is actual like more like social emotional.

1540
01:51:51,315 --> 01:51:58,417
[SPEAKER_14]: And so I was thinking in terms of the budget that, you know, do we have enough counselors at the high school?

1541
01:51:58,857 --> 01:52:05,800
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I'm just, I was really, you know, thinking that myself and I had it highlighted in the report because, you know, I've heard that there's more

1542
01:52:06,179 --> 01:52:10,981
[SPEAKER_14]: social emotional is taking a lot of the time to spend with the students.

1543
01:52:11,621 --> 01:52:18,283
[SPEAKER_14]: And that was just my thought in thinking, do we have enough counselors to assist all of the students?

1544
01:52:18,843 --> 01:52:21,004
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we could always use more, to be honest.

1545
01:52:21,944 --> 01:52:25,626
[SPEAKER_06]: If we don't get more guidance counselors, do we need more adjustment counselors?

1546
01:52:25,726 --> 01:52:26,206
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely.

1547
01:52:26,786 --> 01:52:28,527
[SPEAKER_06]: Looking at having a re-entry program, definitely.

1548
01:52:28,567 --> 01:52:33,108
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not our department, so that would come out of half of Medaglio's budget, I believe.

1549
01:52:33,148 --> 01:52:35,209
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think Stacey Shulman's working on a report.

1550
01:52:36,577 --> 01:52:45,000
[SPEAKER_06]: We definitely, I've had a lot of students hospitalized this year, if they don't already have an adjustment counselor, that their reentry, all of that falls on guidance.

1551
01:52:45,080 --> 01:52:50,562
[SPEAKER_06]: So there is way more social emotional need that comes up each and every year that is falling on us.

1552
01:52:50,802 --> 01:52:59,825
[SPEAKER_06]: So if it's that we have another guidance counselor to spread that out or the supportive adjustment so that when things are becoming overwhelming, if it's clear, if it's,

1553
01:53:01,208 --> 01:53:07,070
