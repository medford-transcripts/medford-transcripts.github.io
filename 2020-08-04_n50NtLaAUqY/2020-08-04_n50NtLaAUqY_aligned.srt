1
00:00:02,946 --> 00:00:07,148
All right, good morning ladies and gentlemen and members of the Medford Public Schools.

2
00:00:07,208 --> 00:00:13,011
My name is Peter Cushing and I am an assistant superintendent at Medford Public Schools.

3
00:00:13,271 --> 00:00:20,435
This morning we are sorry we're getting some feedback so just give me one second.

4
00:00:24,478 --> 00:00:33,500
So we're here today to try to provide some answers and take as much feedback as possible on our plan to reopen schools.

5
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,740
We're really looking to hear what parents have to say.

6
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:47,423
And, you know, please understand that there are certain challenges that we are facing in opening this and reopening schools.

7
00:00:47,883 --> 00:00:52,844
I do want to turn it to our superintendent, Dr. Maurice Edward Vincent.

8
00:00:54,992 --> 00:00:55,712
momentarily.

9
00:00:59,574 --> 00:01:00,634
Good morning, everyone.

10
00:01:00,734 --> 00:01:05,737
Thank you for joining this opportunity to give us plenty of feedback.

11
00:01:06,497 --> 00:01:13,480
All of your comments, your questions, your concerns are going to be saved in the streaming chat side.

12
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,342
So we're going to be focusing on getting an FAQ out by the end of the week.

13
00:01:19,542 --> 00:01:28,529
Shortly after I speak, you're going to hear from several members of our administrative team that are also working to respond to questions as they come forward.

14
00:01:29,149 --> 00:01:34,633
We have questions to some, we have answers to some of your questions, but definitely not all of them.

15
00:01:35,114 --> 00:01:40,958
So again, this is an opportunity for you to give us ideas, your thoughts, your perspectives, your concerns.

16
00:01:41,578 --> 00:01:47,403
We want to take all of that information in to help us better inform what our next steps are going to look like.

17
00:01:48,083 --> 00:02:02,276
So I want to say that given the challenging and complicated circumstances, there really is no ideal plan for Medford, but it's about trying to be able to move forward in a way that's best for our students.

18
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:04,057
So I wanted to say that.

19
00:02:04,337 --> 00:02:06,059
Again, we don't have all the answers.

20
00:02:06,579 --> 00:02:08,801
Things are going to continue to evolve and change.

21
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:13,606
We're going to continue to get guidance from the CDC, from the governor, from the commissioner.

22
00:02:14,266 --> 00:02:19,490
So even between now and the start of school, there could be a definite change.

23
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:27,055
I want to also invite you all this Thursday, we're going to be having a school committee meeting starting at 6 p.m.

24
00:02:27,075 --> 00:02:28,996
It will be posted later today.

25
00:02:29,117 --> 00:02:33,540
So I hope you'll be able to join us on Thursday as well.

26
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:42,181
So I want to give you just a little bit of an overview of where we've been, the overview of the process that we have used in Medford.

27
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:49,090
So we did develop a collaborative process that included stakeholders from across the community.

28
00:02:50,191 --> 00:02:56,379
We use three guiding pillars, our three core values, or equity, consistency, and safety.

29
00:02:56,919 --> 00:03:05,170
And those guiding pillars help to keep us focused and to let us really know that this is the direction that we're going to be moving in.

30
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,511
It helped to drive our work.

31
00:03:07,935 --> 00:03:10,056
In addition to that, we had work groups.

32
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:18,604
We had an instructional work group, we had an operations work group, and we had a communications work group.

33
00:03:18,945 --> 00:03:20,426
We also had a steering committee.

34
00:03:20,827 --> 00:03:28,354
And all of these groups were made up of all stakeholders, teachers, administrators, parents,

35
00:03:30,055 --> 00:03:35,002
representing all the different groups that represent Medford Public Schools.

36
00:03:35,623 --> 00:03:40,769
And so for that, I am very, very proud of what we were able to do and to accomplish.

37
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:46,657
Last week, we did hold two listening sessions because we had approximately

38
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,642
250 people who wanted to sign up to be part of the process.

39
00:03:52,383 --> 00:04:06,317
And those listening sessions that we held last week were an opportunity for those members to give us additional feedback and guidance as we were working on our draft plan that was submitted to DESE last Friday.

40
00:04:07,338 --> 00:04:10,279
So, moving forward, what's going to happen?

41
00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:15,961
We have to submit our formal plan to DESE on Monday, August 10th.

42
00:04:16,101 --> 00:04:17,602
That's our finalized plan.

43
00:04:17,762 --> 00:04:23,944
In between now and then, I will be participating in impact bargaining with our teachers union

44
00:04:24,724 --> 00:04:28,549
because this is going to require a change in working conditions.

45
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:35,938
And so it's a critical step that needs to happen because of all of the changes that are being proposed.

46
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:39,503
So I will be kind of doing double duty

47
00:04:40,283 --> 00:04:42,704
But that's the work that I'll be working on.

48
00:04:43,644 --> 00:04:50,726
We're negotiating today and on Thursday again, and then Thursday evening we have our school committee meeting.

49
00:04:50,766 --> 00:04:52,387
So I invite you to attend that.

50
00:04:52,967 --> 00:05:02,950
So the goals for today's session is really to be able to hear your thoughts, your ideas, your concerns as we work to finalize the plan.

51
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:06,351
We're going to do our best to address your concerns.

52
00:05:06,411 --> 00:05:18,957
And if we can't address them during this brief amount of time, we will definitely try to respond to all the questions that have come forward in an FAQ that will be released at the end of the week.

53
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:27,702
So again, due to time constraints, we have representatives that will be able to jump in and start responding to your questions.

54
00:05:28,282 --> 00:05:29,982
So I want to say thank you so much.

55
00:05:30,543 --> 00:05:33,623
Again, if you have a question, type your question in.

56
00:05:33,663 --> 00:05:43,666
If you're on Facebook or if you're on YouTube, please type your questions in and we're going to try to highlight the questions and get as many answers as we can for you today.

57
00:05:44,246 --> 00:05:48,847
Thank you again for your participation and I look forward to hearing your feedback.

58
00:05:51,682 --> 00:05:52,783
Okay.

59
00:05:52,943 --> 00:05:55,086
So thank you very much, everybody, for being here.

60
00:05:55,126 --> 00:05:57,428
We already are up to 173 viewers.

61
00:05:57,509 --> 00:06:02,094
Last night we had well over 300, I think approaching 400 at times.

62
00:06:02,975 --> 00:06:07,380
So I'm actually going to take my mask off because the superintendent has left the room.

63
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,923
Last night we received some feedback that our masks were down at times.

64
00:06:11,943 --> 00:06:13,264
I want to apologize for that.

65
00:06:13,304 --> 00:06:18,708
We definitely want to lead by example, but also the three of us, myself, Ms.

66
00:06:18,748 --> 00:06:37,202
Galussi, and the superintendent have been working so incredibly closely together that we're actually limiting our contact with our family and friends outside of school, because the work that we're doing to try to reopen schools is really, really targeted and focused, and unfortunately at times needs us to be very close together.

67
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:41,819
Um, but we also do want to be setting a good example for everybody.

68
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:45,880
Um, today we're using a product called stream yard.

69
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:49,421
This is not, um, this is not like zoom.

70
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:53,323
Um, because we were expecting last night was a good example.

71
00:06:53,383 --> 00:06:55,063
Our zoom capacity is 300.

72
00:06:55,643 --> 00:07:01,285
Literally anyone anywhere in the world could watch our broadcast on YouTube and Facebook right now.

73
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:05,746
And it is automatically recording to those sites as well.

74
00:07:05,866 --> 00:07:11,168
So you will always be able to go back and look and rewatch to your heart's content.

75
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:17,090
So we will be working to answer your questions tonight.

76
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:19,871
Right now I want to throw it to members of the panel.

77
00:07:21,372 --> 00:07:38,173
starting with, let's go with Mr. DeLava to introduce themselves, as well as tell what committee, what work group they were working on, as well as any information they feel is important to share at this time.

78
00:07:41,798 --> 00:07:42,818
Hello, everyone.

79
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:46,840
For those, I mean, most of you that do know me, but those that don't, my name is Paul DeLeva.

80
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:51,322
I'm the principal of Medford High School and Medford Vocational Technical High School.

81
00:07:52,062 --> 00:07:54,703
During this process, I was part of two committees.

82
00:07:54,803 --> 00:08:06,408
I was a member of the steering committee, reviewing everything that was coming in regarding the other committees, as well as I was a participant in the remote

83
00:08:07,108 --> 00:08:14,174
option of the instructional group so I have some feedback or information that I can answer regarding that particular topic.

84
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:41,727
I am the other Paul in the group.

85
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:43,069
My name is Paul Tispera.

86
00:08:43,249 --> 00:08:52,662
I'm the director for English learners and I was on the hybrid committee putting together the hybrid schedule and logistics for that.

87
00:08:53,868 --> 00:08:55,929
And I'll turn it over to Joan Bowen.

88
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:56,509
Good morning.

89
00:08:56,529 --> 00:08:57,509
My name is Joan Bowen.

90
00:08:57,549 --> 00:09:00,390
I'm the Director of Pupil Services here at Medford Public Schools.

91
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:09,813
I was also involved in the steering committee and I was also charged with working on the hybrid model for the high school students.

92
00:09:17,596 --> 00:09:19,696
And we see Toni.

93
00:09:19,896 --> 00:09:21,917
I think she's having connectivity issues.

94
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:32,672
I'm the supervisor of services and I'm here to answer any questions you have about medical protocols.

95
00:09:33,972 --> 00:09:46,815
I do want to say last night I did receive a question about the closing of classrooms and I wanted to follow up with some information from the Department of Ed on this.

96
00:09:48,734 --> 00:09:51,015
And I will read directly from the protocols.

97
00:09:51,575 --> 00:10:07,403
If there is more than one confirmed COVID case, either students or staff in the school, school leaders and student will work with the local board of health to determine if the transmission is likely happening in class or in school.

98
00:10:08,363 --> 00:10:13,605
So we will continue our collaboration with the Medford Department of Public Health and those decisions.

99
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:28,291
So unfortunately, Toni's having some internet problems, and they definitely work to get her back in as quickly as possible.

100
00:10:29,352 --> 00:10:30,872
Oh, she's back, which is good.

101
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:32,373
Yep, I apologize.

102
00:10:33,053 --> 00:10:43,257
I just want to say that we will continue our collaboration with the Medford Board of Health on making decisions about closing classrooms.

103
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:46,679
Cool.

104
00:10:48,962 --> 00:10:52,084
So I think everybody has introduced themselves at this point.

105
00:10:53,385 --> 00:10:54,846
My name, once again, Peter Cushing.

106
00:10:54,866 --> 00:10:56,127
I'm the assistant superintendent.

107
00:10:56,147 --> 00:11:05,053
I worked on the operations team, and we've been really focusing in on issues of transportation, heating, ventilation, air conditioning.

108
00:11:05,433 --> 00:11:11,137
We currently have teams going through our schools and our buildings looking for the parts to repair

109
00:11:12,657 --> 00:11:34,842
the areas that, you know, interior rooms that we may have to shut down, especially at our high school, whatever it may be, we are committed to making sure that our facilities are safe and that we have policies and procedures set up to be able to be successful in this area.

110
00:11:36,042 --> 00:11:39,003
So we have an email address

111
00:11:40,804 --> 00:11:41,265
for you.

112
00:11:42,245 --> 00:11:46,248
It's info at medford.k12.ma.us.

113
00:11:47,428 --> 00:11:49,890
And we're going to attempt to answer all of your questions.

114
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:52,652
And we definitely are not dodging any questions.

115
00:11:53,752 --> 00:11:57,615
We want to make sure that we're being 100% transparent and clear on this.

116
00:11:58,895 --> 00:12:03,198
But questions come in so fast and serious at times.

117
00:12:03,809 --> 00:12:08,150
that a really good question may get pushed back or something along those lines.

118
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:14,872
I want to once again thank the 215 people that are currently on this call, which is really awesome.

119
00:12:14,932 --> 00:12:19,513
If you were here last night, we're going to do our absolute best to answer as many questions as possible.

120
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:23,394
Is there anyone else who would like to introduce themselves?

121
00:12:23,694 --> 00:12:28,936
Or Tom, if you want to jump in, introduce yourself, and then let's start going to questions.

122
00:12:37,915 --> 00:12:38,996
All right.

123
00:12:39,196 --> 00:12:40,277
Peter, I can come in.

124
00:12:40,317 --> 00:12:41,839
I apologize for the connection issues.

125
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:42,780
Good morning, everyone.

126
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,460
Thanks for joining.

127
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:46,062
I'm Tom Villachesky.

128
00:12:46,082 --> 00:12:47,684
I'm the superintendent of residence this year.

129
00:12:48,064 --> 00:12:52,708
I'm working alongside Dr. Morgan and the rest of the leadership team.

130
00:12:52,768 --> 00:12:57,713
I was facilitating the communications stakeholder engagement work group

131
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,361
and also a member of the Steering Committee.

132
00:13:00,841 --> 00:13:08,865
And my role today is to be trying to get questions out to members of the team.

133
00:13:09,185 --> 00:13:15,087
So I'll be kind of working behind the scenes here and pull up the questions that you have, and try to get them to people who can answer them here.

134
00:13:15,107 --> 00:13:19,209
So I will do my best again to get up as many questions as I can.

135
00:13:19,249 --> 00:13:21,510
They're coming back on my screen.

136
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:21,610
So

137
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,131
If I build it all up there, I apologize.

138
00:13:24,151 --> 00:13:28,554
But again, I'm trying to get as many as I can covering a broad variety of topics here.

139
00:13:28,834 --> 00:13:30,235
So keep them coming in.

140
00:13:30,295 --> 00:13:30,935
Let's start.

141
00:13:31,475 --> 00:13:35,137
I'm going to show one screen so you can see how this works out.

142
00:13:36,058 --> 00:13:41,581
All right.

143
00:13:41,781 --> 00:13:50,586
So when an in-school student is required to quarantine due to exposure, Tony, I'm going to, well,

144
00:13:54,603 --> 00:13:56,824
I'm going to throw this one to Tony Ray.

145
00:13:56,844 --> 00:14:11,292
If an in-school student is required to quarantine because of a possible or known exposure, will they suddenly be in a completely new online class for the duration of that quarantine?

146
00:14:11,752 --> 00:14:14,333
How will that transition back and forth be handled?

147
00:14:14,893 --> 00:14:17,595
Now, so that's both a help and an instructional question.

148
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:22,591
Right, so I will answer the health part of the question.

149
00:14:24,172 --> 00:14:38,937
Yes, if students are required to quarantine because of a possible or known exposure, they should be hooked up to... I'm losing traction again, I apologize.

150
00:14:38,957 --> 00:14:39,758
Okay.

151
00:14:54,386 --> 00:14:57,328
I'm losing all the connection here, I'm sorry.

152
00:15:02,823 --> 00:15:07,328
Tom, let's move to another question and we'll come back to this one when Tony's connection is more secure.

153
00:15:07,368 --> 00:15:10,211
I apologize, everybody, that we're having these internet issues.

154
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:15,736
As you see, this is a problem that we are facing.

155
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:23,063
If you guys could jump in, I'm going to actually go try to address some of these connection issues.

156
00:15:23,908 --> 00:15:26,410
Dr. Cushing, I can answer the second part of this question.

157
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:33,956
So if a student has been in a hybrid classroom, they would continue on that path during the quarantine.

158
00:15:33,996 --> 00:15:36,017
They wouldn't jump into the remote.

159
00:15:36,618 --> 00:15:38,599
At least that's the plan at this time.

160
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:43,383
Keep in mind, this is still a draft, and this is why we're looking for feedback.

161
00:15:44,213 --> 00:15:55,503
But we feel it's best for the student to maintain that consistency with the cohort of students, with the work that they're doing, and do that on a remote basis.

162
00:15:55,563 --> 00:15:59,686
So they wouldn't switch from like hybrid to the full remote if they're ill.

163
00:15:59,706 --> 00:16:06,953
And then also it's different for every student how, you know, to the level of illness they may have if they're not capable of

164
00:16:07,914 --> 00:16:12,145
jumping in and doing the work because they need the rest and whatnot.

165
00:16:12,265 --> 00:16:14,811
So we would keep the students where they are.

166
00:16:38,689 --> 00:16:50,018
So for this question, we decided to look at the chunks of instruction in four to six week periods and reassess at that time.

167
00:17:16,371 --> 00:17:18,237
And I think we may have lost Tom as well.

168
00:17:18,257 --> 00:17:20,383
So I'm just going to go to the comment section.

169
00:17:20,403 --> 00:17:21,848
Yeah, I think.

170
00:17:22,929 --> 00:17:29,374
There's a couple things that I did notice on the comment section that maybe I could address on the remote end.

171
00:17:30,435 --> 00:17:34,979
Some people are asking about asynchronous time versus synchronous time.

172
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:48,690
So on the high school level, the idea is that we want to have a set schedule so that classes, synchronous or asynchronous, are labeled specifically

173
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:52,452
so that nobody is basically stepping on each other's toes.

174
00:17:52,532 --> 00:18:00,436
I think some things that happened last year in the spring was we don't want students having to choose which synchronous class to go.

175
00:18:01,036 --> 00:18:11,322
We've mapped it out so that basically where you are at like period one on a Monday, it will tell you that that's the class that you're going to meet online.

176
00:18:11,342 --> 00:18:11,962
And then

177
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:20,970
The second period on Monday, for example, that's when you go asynchronous and you do your asynchronous work.

178
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:23,251
And then third period, you're gonna do your synchronous work.

179
00:18:23,732 --> 00:18:29,035
So it balances out between teacher and student on a full remote plan.

180
00:18:29,735 --> 00:18:35,498
And then the idea would be that electives would be based off of days.

181
00:18:36,118 --> 00:18:43,963
So for example, if you have, the way our schedule works with electives is A and D day tend to have the same classes.

182
00:18:44,743 --> 00:18:56,185
and B and E day have the same classes in C and F. So if you look at our sample schedule that's on the plan, like Monday would be your A elective day.

183
00:18:56,505 --> 00:19:02,526
The reason why it's like that is that not every elective meets at the same period.

184
00:19:02,586 --> 00:19:08,667
So for example, a student could have an elective first period or another student could have an elective sixth period.

185
00:19:09,127 --> 00:19:11,768
So we're trying to make sure we ensure that

186
00:19:14,168 --> 00:19:19,031
nobody's stepping on each other's toes and everybody's getting what they need regarding instruction.

187
00:19:20,812 --> 00:19:30,078
And with the hybrid model, the way it was set up is we divided the, you know, we would be dividing the students into two cohorts, cohort one and cohort two.

188
00:19:30,478 --> 00:19:33,420
Cohort one will be in school on Mondays and Tuesdays.

189
00:19:34,098 --> 00:19:38,463
and they will do their independent asynchronous learning on Thursdays and Fridays.

190
00:19:38,984 --> 00:19:44,130
The teacher will then be with cohort two on Thursday, Friday for the live in-person instruction.

191
00:19:44,731 --> 00:19:49,217
And the students in cohort two would do their asynchronous learning on Monday, Tuesday.

192
00:19:49,817 --> 00:20:09,203
Wednesday is a remote day for everyone and this is an opportunity for the teachers to bring cohort one and cohort two together because that is the full makeup of the classroom for some remote live instruction for the students because that will support students with whichever direction we end up going into.

193
00:20:09,644 --> 00:20:16,546
If we end up having to go full remote because the governor does another shutdown, the students will have had experience with the remote learning.

194
00:20:17,777 --> 00:20:32,983
from their teacher and that would be their class, or if things get better and we can return to school full time, those students will be able to have had opportunities to interact with the other students in the other cohort, which is the makeup of their class.

195
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:43,587
So we have a question here from Amanda O'Leary.

196
00:20:43,747 --> 00:20:49,049
It does not appear to be clear how much synchronous versus asynchronous time is occurring in the hybrid model.

197
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:58,552
If somebody, you know, working on that model would be able to speak to it, that would be helpful.

198
00:20:58,612 --> 00:21:01,033
I can talk about what we did at the elementary level.

199
00:21:02,878 --> 00:21:12,028
Joan, you were part of the high school, but at the elementary level, we're doing an asynchronous schedule for the elementary students when they're home.

200
00:21:12,148 --> 00:21:20,998
And we're giving them the amount of time that they should be spending doing their asynchronous learning for each class on the days that they're home.

201
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:22,299
Joan?

202
00:21:26,487 --> 00:21:39,410
And that's a similar model for the high school as well, is the days that the students are working virtually from home, there is a lot of the, we have it scheduled, so it's math, but it would be that asynchronous time.

203
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:46,691
There is a question regarding remote morning.

204
00:21:46,711 --> 00:21:49,472
So for the high school,

205
00:21:50,872 --> 00:21:55,296
Homeroom will be asynchronous, I'm sorry, will be synchronous every single day.

206
00:21:55,797 --> 00:22:02,483
That's going to be a check-in for our students to meet with their homeroom teachers if we are all remote.

207
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:15,596
And that way, as well, we can have discussions so that, for example, that homeroom teacher, if there's something that we can track who has been in attendance or not been in attendance,

208
00:22:16,318 --> 00:22:22,563
Then on an administrative standpoint, we can do our check-ins and things like that with families and students.

209
00:22:22,643 --> 00:22:26,286
So every day within the high school, homeroom will be synchronous.

210
00:22:26,366 --> 00:22:31,990
And again, it's sort of like a morning meeting with the elementary, same kind of idea.

211
00:22:32,911 --> 00:22:39,736
It's more of a time for us just to check in with our students to see what needs would be, and then that information can be filtered out.

212
00:22:40,116 --> 00:22:44,820
There's also going to be office hours at the end of the day for two days a week.

213
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:54,883
Again, we're scheduling it so that every teacher has that same time frame, so there's no stepping on each other's toes, and everybody is on the same page regarding that.

214
00:22:55,323 --> 00:23:08,428
And I know that's more of a high school discussion, but I think the idea of having a morning meeting, I think that was expressed pretty highly within the committee, and we wanted to ensure that that connection was being made.

215
00:23:10,702 --> 00:23:16,989
Um, so one of the things that we are doing, um, we have purchased, um, about 2000 Chromebooks.

216
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:29,784
Um, right now there's some supply chain distributions, uh, as well as, um, some, um, issues with, uh, United States customs, uh, backlog at customs.

217
00:23:30,264 --> 00:23:30,364
Um,

218
00:23:31,324 --> 00:23:37,191
And then furthermore, there are some questions as to the labor that was used to produce some of those.

219
00:23:37,611 --> 00:23:42,577
So we've got a lot of different issues going around with getting the Chromebooks.

220
00:23:42,777 --> 00:23:50,045
We're still targeted for a mid-August delivery, but we're monitoring that.

221
00:23:50,305 --> 00:23:52,528
We do plan to have a Chromebook

222
00:23:53,329 --> 00:23:55,130
available for every single student.

223
00:23:55,331 --> 00:23:59,735
If we are unable to deliver on that, we will prioritize student need.

224
00:24:00,516 --> 00:24:04,680
We do have about 2,200 devices in district at present.

225
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:12,648
We have ordered hotspots using the CARES Act money and those types of things.

226
00:24:13,328 --> 00:24:23,314
Joan, there's a question around 504, and I think maybe you can extrapolate this to IEPs as well if you want to discuss that quickly.

227
00:24:25,916 --> 00:24:26,216
Sure.

228
00:24:26,236 --> 00:24:31,980
So with the 504 plan, those are in the general education setting.

229
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:36,002
So those would continue whether on a remote or hybrid plan.

230
00:24:36,583 --> 00:24:39,264
It depends on what the specific accommodations are.

231
00:24:39,404 --> 00:24:40,565
If it means, say,

232
00:24:42,678 --> 00:24:45,140
It could be extra time for tests.

233
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:49,163
We would make sure that your student still gets that accommodation.

234
00:24:49,503 --> 00:24:59,450
And the same thing with IEPs, whatever the modifications and accommodations are on for your particular child, we would follow that in either the remote or hybrid learning as well.

235
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:04,193
Awesome.

236
00:25:04,433 --> 00:25:06,675
Let's just see.

237
00:25:17,623 --> 00:25:23,745
There's a question about Monday, Tuesday holidays and how that would impact in the hybrid model.

238
00:25:24,185 --> 00:25:39,469
At least for the first half of the year, we did count out and the Monday, Tuesday group would have one less day than the Thursday, Friday group because we have Monday holidays, we have a Tuesday,

239
00:25:41,012 --> 00:25:49,958
the election day, but then in November, and we're not sure how long this will extend into, we have the Thursday, Friday for the Thanksgiving break.

240
00:25:50,058 --> 00:25:53,540
So it's evenly balanced with the exception of one day.

241
00:25:56,382 --> 00:25:57,822
So we also have a question here.

242
00:25:57,882 --> 00:26:04,887
Will some of the synchronous instructions be recorded so that students who couldn't attend still learn the material?

243
00:26:05,347 --> 00:26:06,848
Would anyone like to jump in on that?

244
00:26:10,363 --> 00:26:12,425
I can jump in a little bit.

245
00:26:12,605 --> 00:26:38,827
There's been discussion of doing recordings, but the issue that we run into regarding having students being part of it and not having consent, there's a little bit of stuff that we're trying to work out via that part of it, and if it's the focus of the teacher doing the lessons, then yes, and it will be recorded and then sent out.

246
00:26:41,278 --> 00:26:49,705
can't guarantee that at this point in time because we don't know what the structure will look like and we can't say every lesson is going to be recorded.

247
00:26:50,046 --> 00:26:57,092
So if the student is absent and attendance will be taken, they would make up the work like they typically would if they had missed a day of school.

248
00:26:58,433 --> 00:27:02,737
But school times and class times are not optional.

249
00:27:04,086 --> 00:27:12,009
like they were, you know, it was a little bit less structured in the spring with the abrupt closure of the schools.

250
00:27:13,009 --> 00:27:20,251
But this is a school day and the school times are something that, you know, teachers and students all have to adhere to.

251
00:27:22,652 --> 00:27:26,113
So, Tony, we got a question here that is right up your alley.

252
00:27:27,516 --> 00:27:29,517
Okay, I saw that coming through.

253
00:27:30,377 --> 00:27:41,740
What I would like to let parents know is that the district has partnered with a local software company who has developed a mobile COVID symptom tracker application.

254
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,601
At a later, as we get closer to school, we will make that available to parents.

255
00:27:46,801 --> 00:27:56,204
They can sign up as a user and every day log into the app and go through the questions about different symptoms.

256
00:27:56,344 --> 00:27:56,724
The app

257
00:27:57,985 --> 00:28:00,526
has been developed by a physician.

258
00:28:00,906 --> 00:28:03,868
So it will work, the algorithm will work parents through.

259
00:28:03,888 --> 00:28:10,531
The decision says you stay home from school or yes, you may go to school.

260
00:28:11,552 --> 00:28:15,254
So we will be providing a lot of information about that as we get closer to school.

261
00:28:15,294 --> 00:28:18,456
And we hope parents make use of this really valuable tool.

262
00:28:20,548 --> 00:28:25,451
Um, so we've got a question, um, about elementary hybrid.

263
00:28:25,791 --> 00:28:30,054
I'm going to try to bring in principal Demos here, uh, to help out with this one.

264
00:28:31,074 --> 00:28:35,557
Um, and let's see, um, if I've added your audio.

265
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,600
Can you hear me, Paul?

266
00:28:41,681 --> 00:28:41,961
Peter?

267
00:28:42,461 --> 00:28:42,681
Yes.

268
00:28:42,802 --> 00:28:43,102
Good to go.

269
00:28:43,912 --> 00:28:46,693
Okay, so hi, I'm Shannon Demos.

270
00:28:46,773 --> 00:28:48,174
I'm the Brooks Elementary Principal.

271
00:28:48,194 --> 00:28:56,757
I'm sorry about the connectivity issues that we're having today, but what I was just hearing on my right, Peter, is that we had a question regarding the hybrid plan.

272
00:28:58,557 --> 00:29:07,641
So in elementary, we are looking at the hybrid plan in a way that meets the needs of all the individual students.

273
00:29:08,201 --> 00:29:12,423
We are looking at having the students come in to buildings.

274
00:29:13,663 --> 00:29:38,861
two days a week and alternating the cohorts on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday with some combining of the cohorts A and B Wednesday morning for some social emotional time and community building on Wednesday morning prior to them going to their you know specialists or along for the teacher and family parent

275
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:44,954
communication time and some remote learning on Wednesday as well.

276
00:29:46,035 --> 00:29:50,919
I cannot see the questions or the comments, unfortunately, because of the connectivity issues in here.

277
00:29:51,379 --> 00:29:54,762
Was there a question that I can't see?

278
00:29:55,623 --> 00:30:02,388
So Shannon, also the question really, the question, there's another question too, focusing on how will the remote work for elementary?

279
00:30:02,408 --> 00:30:03,749
Okay.

280
00:30:06,465 --> 00:30:18,378
So when you look at the remote, we shared an elementary draft schedule with the community that allows for the students to mirror their school day as much as possible.

281
00:30:18,439 --> 00:30:19,920
That was key to us, right?

282
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,924
That structure and that consistency for the kiddos.

283
00:30:24,285 --> 00:30:31,008
They'll start their day out with attendance being taken in the morning by their homeroom teacher, their classroom teacher.

284
00:30:31,548 --> 00:30:37,051
They'll start with a morning meeting and some social emotional community building every day.

285
00:30:37,951 --> 00:30:49,277
Once they finish with that morning meeting, they have been built in a little bit of a movement break, a little continuation of the morning meeting before they jump into an academic block.

286
00:30:50,620 --> 00:31:03,348
Once they have that block of time where they have their first academics covered, we've built in an offline break just to get their eyes off the screen, just a couple of minutes for a snack and a movement break.

287
00:31:03,889 --> 00:31:13,275
Maybe give them a chance to stretch and get to the bathroom and then come back to sign on again for a second win block, a literacy block.

288
00:31:14,075 --> 00:31:16,757
so that we can make sure that we're meeting their needs.

289
00:31:17,337 --> 00:31:39,712
Again, after we have that time on synchronous learning for their screen time, we have another block off for their lunch and recess, call them back on for a specialist block, a final academic block of the day, and then we have some office hours where there could be some extra help services or parent-teacher communication at the end of the day.

290
00:31:42,822 --> 00:31:44,343
Okay, awesome, thank you very much.

291
00:31:47,084 --> 00:31:57,430
So there was a question and I can't find it right now, I apologize, around absenteeism and a lot of question around that.

292
00:31:57,530 --> 00:32:10,477
The Department of Elementary and Secondary Education held a telephone call yesterday that the Commissioner Jeff Riley led, and there are definitely going to be significantly more expectations

293
00:32:11,277 --> 00:32:18,642
whereas last March, we really were sent out in an emergency fashion and left to pick up the pieces as best as possible.

294
00:32:19,583 --> 00:32:33,272
The Department of Elementary and Secondary Education is going to be expecting schools to be taking attendance, to be closely monitoring time on learning, which this year is going to be reduced in a typical year.

295
00:32:33,292 --> 00:32:35,154
It's 180 days with 990 hours expected for secondary,

296
00:32:38,956 --> 00:32:41,438
and 900 hours expected for elementary.

297
00:32:41,958 --> 00:32:54,084
At the start of the year, we will have 10 days at the start for professional development for teachers to focus on health and safety protocols, as well as online remote learning protocols.

298
00:32:54,645 --> 00:32:56,386
So those 10 days will be used.

299
00:32:56,446 --> 00:33:07,572
Those 10 days will not be made up per an agreement with the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education and the three major teachers unions in the state, MTA, AFT, and Boston Teachers Union.

300
00:33:08,892 --> 00:33:14,115
So we will be starting, the calendar will be voted this week at the school committee meeting.

301
00:33:14,615 --> 00:33:20,538
We will be making that well known to everybody, but we will start the week of the 14th, it looks like.

302
00:33:21,058 --> 00:33:25,961
All schools are expected to be in session by September 16th, unless you get a waiver from the state.

303
00:33:27,942 --> 00:33:34,665
And so that's the best answer that I have on that, but there is.

304
00:33:35,682 --> 00:33:44,306
there are going to be expectations for attendance being taken, all of those different types of things around that.

305
00:33:44,747 --> 00:33:49,789
Let me pull up a question here about, can remote learning be done at other times?

306
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:52,110
Anyone wants to jump in on that, feel free.

307
00:33:55,772 --> 00:34:00,815
My thought process is if we've labeled out a schedule that says when

308
00:34:02,188 --> 00:34:07,271
Depends what you're talking about for remote because there's the asynchronous and the synchronous part of it.

309
00:34:07,772 --> 00:34:15,977
And I think if you're talking asynchronous time frames, then you have to stick to those time frames that are there.

310
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:23,221
Otherwise, if people go in different directions, it's very hard to make sure that there's equity through instruction.

311
00:34:23,862 --> 00:34:25,203
But that being said,

312
00:34:25,903 --> 00:34:31,109
as Paul Texera said too, we try to consider it like a normal day of school as best we can.

313
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:35,614
So that's kind of the schedule that needs to be followed.

314
00:34:36,615 --> 00:34:38,397
But I'm sure like things can be worked out.

315
00:34:38,517 --> 00:34:45,685
If you have missed the school day, then you contact your teacher like normal and see what can be done to get that instruction that was missed.

316
00:34:49,323 --> 00:34:54,184
So one of the things is why is DESI recommending three foot spacing?

317
00:34:54,205 --> 00:34:58,266
Does the plan specify six foot spacing?

318
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:07,348
Well, so the CDC has recommended six foot spacing and the World Health Organization, I believe, came out with three foot.

319
00:35:08,129 --> 00:35:12,170
But in the United States, given where we are right now with numbers rising,

320
00:35:13,491 --> 00:35:22,441
We want to be as safe as possible in really making sure that we're keeping the spread down.

321
00:35:22,942 --> 00:35:27,347
Tony, if you want to jump in on this question, absolutely be my guest.

322
00:35:27,944 --> 00:35:28,444
Okay.

323
00:35:28,625 --> 00:35:43,096
I would like to add that the contact tracing that is completed by the local boards of health, including Medford, uses six feet as the physical distancing for close contacts.

324
00:35:43,476 --> 00:35:50,241
So if we keep our physical distancing at six feet, we are decreasing the

325
00:35:51,761 --> 00:35:53,782
exposure that children have in class.

326
00:35:54,202 --> 00:35:57,983
Once you move down towards three feet, you're increasing exposure.

327
00:35:58,123 --> 00:36:05,085
We decided to go with the safer measure of six feet and be consistent with the Board of Health contact tracing.

328
00:36:07,906 --> 00:36:17,069
So anyone who can help out with this question about the fully remote for Gabby DaCosta, how will classes be formed for the families choosing fully remote?

329
00:36:17,109 --> 00:36:21,370
Will they be grouped with kids who are fully remote only who will be teaching?

330
00:36:22,375 --> 00:36:26,657
And some of that we may not be able to answer right now, but thank you for the question, Gabby.

331
00:36:27,597 --> 00:36:38,861
So again, we need to look at, and I know you're in negotiations or with bargaining of which teachers are going to be here and which teachers will be doing remote.

332
00:36:39,502 --> 00:36:47,305
And then the other part of it too is, and again, I'm only speaking from the high school level, the idea is to look at what classes have been selected.

333
00:36:48,934 --> 00:36:53,458
or recommended by the teachers for students for this upcoming year.

334
00:36:53,918 --> 00:37:01,664
And then that plan will be determined who's teaching what, who's teaching what remotely based off of a cohort of numbers that we look at.

335
00:37:02,645 --> 00:37:05,007
So I'm thinking about biology, for example.

336
00:37:05,087 --> 00:37:10,632
I mean, we need a biology teacher to do the remote part if that's the option that's there.

337
00:37:11,906 --> 00:37:15,569
where we would have to have a biology teacher for the hybrid part too.

338
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:29,262
So some licenses and some classes have specific teachers that need specific instructional types that they are able to teach.

339
00:37:29,322 --> 00:37:30,563
So that's what we're looking at.

340
00:37:31,064 --> 00:37:33,246
So it's still a work in progress, I guess I would say.

341
00:37:34,899 --> 00:37:35,159
Okay.

342
00:37:35,179 --> 00:37:35,339
Yeah.

343
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:36,600
I'm sorry.

344
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:37,561
Go ahead.

345
00:37:38,122 --> 00:37:39,623
Jump in on the elementary end.

346
00:37:40,104 --> 00:37:43,387
It's definitely still a work in progress on our end as well.

347
00:37:43,467 --> 00:37:50,293
We are awaiting notification from family members that have maybe decided that their student is going to be fully remote all year long.

348
00:37:51,114 --> 00:37:53,116
regardless of what we choose as a hybrid model.

349
00:37:53,536 --> 00:38:04,207
And so we'll have to take those students and create cohorts in their own individual classes accordingly and then reassess the class list that we still have for the students coming in.

350
00:38:04,788 --> 00:38:07,750
There's going to be so many factors that are playing into this.

351
00:38:08,271 --> 00:38:11,074
I mean everything down to like the transportation.

352
00:38:11,274 --> 00:38:14,517
where we are limited to 24 students on a bus.

353
00:38:14,677 --> 00:38:31,330
It may make sense for us to be looking at the cohorts according to the neighborhoods, because I know as an elementary principal, I'm receiving notification from parents that are asking me to group their students with other families in the neighborhood so that they can help out with learning on the days that they're home.

354
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:36,694
And if they are exposed to the children in the neighborhood,

355
00:38:37,875 --> 00:38:39,256
They have become part of a cohort.

356
00:38:39,276 --> 00:38:45,718
It might be something that behooves us to kind of take into our process for our class lists.

357
00:38:45,858 --> 00:38:47,299
But again, it is work in progress.

358
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:49,039
There is many factors that go into this.

359
00:38:49,639 --> 00:38:59,183
Our three core values, I know Dr. Vincent spoke to it yesterday, that we'll always keep in the forefront of these decisions is the safety and equity and consistency for these kiddos.

360
00:39:00,123 --> 00:39:01,544
That really drives our decisions.

361
00:39:02,024 --> 00:39:03,725
But it definitely is a work in progress.

362
00:39:03,785 --> 00:39:07,246
But if you do have specific questions, I do urge the public to just reach out

363
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:11,368
the elementary principals for any questions or comments or concerns they have for us.

364
00:39:13,724 --> 00:39:13,964
All right.

365
00:39:14,224 --> 00:39:16,586
We're going to move to a question now about ventilation.

366
00:39:17,126 --> 00:39:19,627
I addressed it at the beginning, but if people came in late.

367
00:39:20,047 --> 00:39:22,569
So how are the ventilation systems in the schools being addressed?

368
00:39:22,689 --> 00:39:26,150
I have been made aware that it is not up to par, especially at the high school.

369
00:39:26,731 --> 00:39:34,755
So the systems at the high school were installed and have been repaired over the years, but they were primarily installed in 1970.

370
00:39:36,196 --> 00:39:40,498
And so the standards of filtration and different things like that have changed over the years.

371
00:39:41,338 --> 00:39:52,222
and there are certain filters that we just can't install because they would actually lead to a burnout of motors is what we've been told by our ventilation company.

372
00:39:52,802 --> 00:40:08,008
Right now we have an outside contractor as well as our three in-district maintenance staff inspecting and repairing elements of the high school ventilation system and the outside buildings that are not currently functioning.

373
00:40:08,528 --> 00:40:15,550
And so this is an area of concern for us and we are working diligently to make sure that we are addressing it.

374
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:29,333
We have allocated funds from our federal grants to make this happen and we are looking at and costing out filtration systems on a per room basis.

375
00:40:30,625 --> 00:40:32,286
We'll see where that goes with costs.

376
00:40:33,306 --> 00:40:39,049
And we are hoping for federal stimulus money to assist us with a lot of these things.

377
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:51,295
Our outside buildings, the elementary schools that were built in the early 2000s have substantially better ventilation and central controls to manage it.

378
00:40:51,375 --> 00:40:54,777
We are planning to run our ventilation systems 23 hours a day.

379
00:40:55,337 --> 00:40:56,698
DESE is requiring us

380
00:40:57,778 --> 00:41:04,464
to make sure that we have them running two hours before occupancy and two hours after occupancy.

381
00:41:05,005 --> 00:41:14,474
However, in speaking with John McLaughlin, who unfortunately couldn't be on this call today, we are going to run them 23 hours a day with the dampers open full.

382
00:41:14,974 --> 00:41:21,718
Please note that this is going to cause us to have increased costs for electricity and heating costs.

383
00:41:22,158 --> 00:41:28,442
As we pull in that colder air, as the temperature drops, we will need to condition it to be heated.

384
00:41:29,302 --> 00:41:37,827
So that will be something, but we're going to be working with windows open with our ventilation systems operating at maximum capacity.

385
00:41:38,947 --> 00:41:41,588
Principal DeLay, but we got a question for you on freshmen.

386
00:41:42,429 --> 00:41:47,251
And then if you also could speak, there have been questions about freshman vocational rotation.

387
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:50,572
I know Mr. Fallon's not on the call, but if you can speak to that as well.

388
00:41:52,351 --> 00:42:03,817
So, you know, the hope would be that we do some kind of expectation for the freshmen, giving them some overview of what's going to occur.

389
00:42:04,337 --> 00:42:12,081
I think what's kind of holding us up is we will plan something out, but we need to know what direction we're going.

390
00:42:13,362 --> 00:42:19,305
So I guess we're trying to see what happens at school committee on Thursday, and then we're working on planning from

391
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:20,842
that stage.

392
00:42:20,902 --> 00:42:22,606
I mean, we all know that we can't gather.

393
00:42:22,626 --> 00:42:28,680
And if I was to get a whole group of freshmen within the high school, that would be difficult.

394
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:29,663
So maybe we do it

395
00:42:30,396 --> 00:42:33,718
by cohort groups and things of that nature.

396
00:42:33,778 --> 00:42:36,220
But that's really still in the planning.

397
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:42,664
And I guess, again, if I have more information, then I will be able to go down a different road from there.

398
00:42:42,764 --> 00:42:50,069
And then regarding the CT instruction, again, it is dependent on whether we're hybrid or whether we're remote.

399
00:42:50,229 --> 00:42:56,714
If we're remote, then the CT exploratory will go based off of what I stated of the sample schedule.

400
00:42:57,342 --> 00:42:58,063
for the remote.

401
00:42:58,163 --> 00:43:04,188
So if you see C-Day and you have CTE and it's listed synchronous, that's when you log on.

402
00:43:04,909 --> 00:43:15,479
Not obviously the most ideal way of doing vocational instruction, but again, these are just guidelines that we're following if we were to go fully remote.

403
00:43:16,245 --> 00:43:17,046
vice versa.

404
00:43:17,086 --> 00:43:21,290
I know that the plan does have something regarding hybrid.

405
00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:33,000
The vocational school is working on sort of a unique hybrid schedule for their part too that would involve the freshmen attending a class within

406
00:43:35,067 --> 00:43:35,967
the vocational school.

407
00:43:36,008 --> 00:43:47,153
I think the amount of time is really what the issue is, because if you have different periods for different days, your time frame isn't as great as it normally is.

408
00:43:47,873 --> 00:43:51,195
But again, we've been talking to other comprehensive

409
00:43:52,034 --> 00:43:57,196
vocational schools, you know, like Everett, for instance, I've talked into that principle.

410
00:43:57,236 --> 00:43:59,457
They're running into the same kind of concerns.

411
00:43:59,497 --> 00:44:06,459
I think the issue is just which direction we're going will help us guide us where we're going to kind of tighten things up.

412
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:07,839
Okay.

413
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:09,280
Thank you very much.

414
00:44:10,443 --> 00:44:13,785
Um, so, you know, we've received a lot of questions from parents.

415
00:44:13,825 --> 00:44:17,947
There's one here from Heidi about addressing parents who need to work.

416
00:44:18,887 --> 00:44:23,930
Um, and that is one of our greatest concerns who can't be there every day with their child.

417
00:44:25,091 --> 00:44:28,612
Um, and so this is definitely one of our greatest concerns.

418
00:44:29,073 --> 00:44:30,333
We empathize with you.

419
00:44:30,594 --> 00:44:37,057
We want to find a way to figure out how to get those, how to really work with those families

420
00:44:38,578 --> 00:44:41,541
to either have them in school or partnering with other families.

421
00:44:42,461 --> 00:44:44,223
This is one of our greatest concerns.

422
00:44:44,383 --> 00:44:53,971
I feel that phone calls from parents, very emotional phone calls, single families, and so who don't have supports to be able to help them out.

423
00:44:54,111 --> 00:44:58,735
And this is a, I want you to know that we're trying to work towards an answer on this.

424
00:45:00,263 --> 00:45:04,404
It's something that is of great concern to us, for sure.

425
00:45:04,724 --> 00:45:15,408
I'm sorry, I don't have an answer for you right now, but we are working through trying to find some scenarios to help people out in this area.

426
00:45:15,848 --> 00:45:18,489
Joan, there's a question about sub-separate classrooms.

427
00:45:18,889 --> 00:45:20,670
Let me put it up on screen.

428
00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:23,150
A place for sub-separate classrooms.

429
00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:28,072
And so maybe you can use this to speak greater about your realm.

430
00:45:34,485 --> 00:45:34,765
Sure.

431
00:45:34,825 --> 00:45:48,136
So in the comment section, I see a lot of confusion regarding if I choose remote and what if the other members of the classroom in a subseparate class pick the hybrid model.

432
00:45:48,497 --> 00:45:52,640
So I just want to clarify that parents have the right to choose the remote model.

433
00:45:53,261 --> 00:46:01,928
And then what we're looking at is for our special education students remote, that there will be in, as my friend,

434
00:46:03,588 --> 00:46:19,004
depending on where we're at, phase we're in, what the governor's orders are and what the commissioner's orders are, to be able to provide as many in-person services for students who are identified as high needs.

435
00:46:19,144 --> 00:46:22,848
And those would be some of our students in our separate classrooms.

436
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:33,925
So I think parents need just to know that you can pick remote or the school committee is going to pick the plan that the school district follows through on.

437
00:46:34,086 --> 00:46:42,590
So it's not that everyone has a choice that you could pick remote or hybrid or, sorry, I forgot the- Person.

438
00:46:42,971 --> 00:46:43,751
The remote.

439
00:46:46,353 --> 00:46:48,414
Parents to be very clear about that.

440
00:46:49,334 --> 00:46:52,196
Looking at our high needs special education students,

441
00:46:52,799 --> 00:46:59,503
parents will have the opportunity to have in-person services, or they could choose to do fully remote.

442
00:46:59,604 --> 00:47:12,452
And those special education services would still continue remotely with a special education teacher, with paraprofessionals involved, related service providers would either do in-person or remotely.

443
00:47:12,532 --> 00:47:15,634
So I hope that answers some of the questions that were coming up in the comments.

444
00:47:25,570 --> 00:47:29,932
So there's been a question about elementary school children drop off.

445
00:47:30,853 --> 00:47:46,060
So our overarching plan is gonna establish guidelines for the schools that the individual school working teams will have to follow and then build out greater planning on themselves because each school is different.

446
00:47:46,661 --> 00:47:52,444
We do plan to spray paint on the grounds surrounding the school, six foot markers,

447
00:47:53,724 --> 00:48:00,727
So as students are waiting, that they can, and to have students come into the building in six-foot staggered bunches.

448
00:48:02,128 --> 00:48:02,888
I know that Ms.

449
00:48:02,928 --> 00:48:12,432
Demos is starting to work on plans for her buildings, but we also want to, we need to get children into the buildings as quickly as possible, while

450
00:48:13,493 --> 00:48:17,436
and get education started so that students aren't missing time on learning.

451
00:48:18,577 --> 00:48:25,623
So this is definitely going to be a challenge for us, especially given I have a two and a four-year-old.

452
00:48:25,964 --> 00:48:28,126
I'll tell you, the four-year-old loves to hang with her friends.

453
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:31,627
She hasn't been able to do much since the middle of March.

454
00:48:32,507 --> 00:48:36,489
But I remember seeing her on the playground and doing all those types of things.

455
00:48:38,329 --> 00:48:44,371
So we are trying to really make sure that we have a solid plan to get kids into the building.

456
00:48:45,212 --> 00:48:51,434
And if anyone else wants to speak to that, feel free at this time.

457
00:48:53,475 --> 00:49:04,319
I think you touched base on that perfectly, Peter, the building-based teams that are going to be creating plans for this exact question.

458
00:49:04,699 --> 00:49:11,222
There will be specific drop-off as well as dismissal procedures that are different than you've seen in the years past.

459
00:49:11,402 --> 00:49:22,426
But it's definitely building-based teams that will share them out per individual elementary school because of us having different layouts of our arrival and dismissal areas.

460
00:49:28,208 --> 00:49:29,769
I'm just scrolling through the questions.

461
00:49:29,789 --> 00:49:31,909
Has anyone seen anything?

462
00:49:33,609 --> 00:49:47,992
There's a question I would like to address, and it's about a question about has the district established standards for testing volume, testing availability, positive test percentages, and turnaround time in order to safely have students at school?

463
00:49:49,372 --> 00:49:56,293
I'd like to say that that is a responsibility and under the authority of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, working with

464
00:49:56,709 --> 00:49:57,949
local boards of health.

465
00:49:58,830 --> 00:50:17,096
That being said, using our electronic medical record system, school nurses are able to safely track students and keep track of the numbers of both COVID positive and COVID exposed children.

466
00:50:17,416 --> 00:50:23,998
And we will be using that when we communicate with the local board of health to determine whether classrooms

467
00:50:24,505 --> 00:50:31,568
need to be closed down, or reaching out to DESE to see if we need to close a school down.

468
00:50:31,588 --> 00:50:35,370
Okay.

469
00:50:35,730 --> 00:50:43,814
So we've had a lot of questions on busing, and so I expect to actually be speaking to the MBTA today about buses.

470
00:50:44,254 --> 00:50:52,238
We are definitely hoping to add more buses from the MBTA to allow for appropriate social distancing.

471
00:50:53,098 --> 00:50:56,861
All students are required to wear masks on the buses.

472
00:50:57,222 --> 00:51:05,409
If you want to get a Medford branded mask, you can get one at bseenmasks.com if you want to represent your Medford pride.

473
00:51:06,210 --> 00:51:08,632
We will have masks available for families.

474
00:51:09,653 --> 00:51:13,256
We've had seamstresses donating masks.

475
00:51:13,316 --> 00:51:15,818
We'll have emergency masks in case one breaks.

476
00:51:16,238 --> 00:51:22,780
But we're really asking families to make sure that their child has masks available to them.

477
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:30,782
Much like underwear, a new mask every day, so it's being laundered and cleaned in that type of situation.

478
00:51:31,942 --> 00:51:35,783
But we will work, if families want to donate masks, we will happily take them.

479
00:51:37,403 --> 00:51:50,407
And Tony, if you want to just speak about Mass once I talk a little bit more about the MBTA, I have had a little bit of a challenge reaching out to them, but I want to thank Lisa Evangelista for putting me in touch with one of the supervisors over at the MBTA.

480
00:51:50,727 --> 00:52:01,991
So I'll be making sure to make contact with them today and make sure that we have some really good answers for our MBTA buses and transportation for our students.

481
00:52:04,483 --> 00:52:05,483
Okay, thank you, Peter.

482
00:52:05,924 --> 00:52:07,844
Just a word about masks.

483
00:52:09,585 --> 00:52:16,347
We know from our experience that masks made of tightly woven fabric are much more protective.

484
00:52:16,847 --> 00:52:20,469
So we would advise parents to buy cotton or cotton knit masks.

485
00:52:21,369 --> 00:52:27,531
The style, meaning whether there's ear loops or ties, really is up to the comfort of the wearer.

486
00:52:28,732 --> 00:52:32,513
It's more important that the child be comfortable wearing the mask,

487
00:52:33,594 --> 00:52:35,376
and be agreeable to wearing it.

488
00:52:35,516 --> 00:52:38,679
So that style is a comfort matter.

489
00:52:40,001 --> 00:52:42,844
We will be asking people to have a clean mask for every day.

490
00:52:43,284 --> 00:52:50,452
During the mask breaks, we would like students to be able to put their mask into a Ziploc bag.

491
00:52:51,807 --> 00:53:03,298
label it with their name and that way it protects the mask while they are eating lunch or while they are maybe taking a walk around the school school yard break.

492
00:53:05,447 --> 00:53:14,674
Let's see, I have pulled together a resource list, both online and local vendors that sell masks at very reasonable cost.

493
00:53:14,874 --> 00:53:19,678
And that is posted in the reopening plan in one of the appendixes.

494
00:53:20,359 --> 00:53:24,822
So we ask that people look there for some extra resources.

495
00:53:25,483 --> 00:53:34,390
We are fortunate to have a very dedicated group of volunteer seamstresses who are making cloth masks that will be on hand in every school

496
00:53:35,281 --> 00:53:39,503
in case a child loses or soils or breaks their other mask.

497
00:53:41,924 --> 00:53:42,264
Awesome.

498
00:53:42,304 --> 00:53:43,005
Thank you very much.

499
00:53:43,705 --> 00:53:50,668
I'm just looking through the questions now.

500
00:53:50,708 --> 00:53:59,852
If any of the other panelists have seen anything that you'd like to address and jump in on, by all means, go for it at this time as I scroll through our questions.

501
00:54:02,646 --> 00:54:25,012
actually I've got one for you Joan right here there's a question that says how will stuff yes so IEP will be continued to be held remotely we're going to limit the number of enter the building so I'm

502
00:54:26,218 --> 00:54:28,780
meeting you to be totally setting full time.

503
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:29,921
Um, the for remote.

504
00:54:29,941 --> 00:54:31,302
Um, so for h kids on I E. P. S. Um,

505
00:54:41,589 --> 00:54:51,191
I'm not sure if the person is asking how the services will look on remote, but parents have the option to pick the remote plan.

506
00:54:51,771 --> 00:55:00,033
Students will continue to receive their IEP services, accommodations, and modifications based on the remote schedule.

507
00:55:00,093 --> 00:55:04,294
So there will be synchronous, there will be asynchronous, there will be telehealth,

508
00:55:05,815 --> 00:55:14,314
And depending on if they are a high-need student that is able to come in for in-person services, we will provide those in-person as much as possible.

509
00:55:17,329 --> 00:55:24,416
I also want to say that we're going to try to have, we're really going to be limiting visitors to the buildings in our plan.

510
00:55:25,057 --> 00:55:33,285
We're going to be looking to have, if you need to have a parent meeting, it's going to be one parent at a time, if at all possible.

511
00:55:33,305 --> 00:55:38,070
We're going to be doing meetings as remote as possible.

512
00:55:38,610 --> 00:55:43,594
we're really gonna be looking to limit the entry of as many people as possible.

513
00:55:43,634 --> 00:56:04,451
Now, I understand that this contradicts with us looking for volunteers to help out with lunch, but we're trying to balance the needs of the school versus our financially available resources and managing our, so I understand the innate contradiction there,

514
00:56:05,051 --> 00:56:09,152
but we are trying to work through this situation as best as possible.

515
00:56:09,632 --> 00:56:12,853
I want to address, will there be a dress code for masks?

516
00:56:12,933 --> 00:56:14,793
Other schools have said solid masks only.

517
00:56:14,893 --> 00:56:22,035
I've actually seen that put out by other schools, and no, we will not have a dress code for masks.

518
00:56:22,635 --> 00:56:23,795
It'll be like everything else.

519
00:56:24,515 --> 00:56:31,797
We will follow state laws, and it can't have inappropriate slogans or words or things like that on it,

520
00:56:33,657 --> 00:56:40,220
Other than that, if you want to design on your mask wavy lines or whatever it may be, go for it.

521
00:56:40,861 --> 00:56:43,522
We will not tolerate any hate speech.

522
00:56:44,062 --> 00:56:47,004
We will not tolerate anything inappropriate.

523
00:56:48,024 --> 00:56:54,988
And we will be prepared to give your child a mask to replace that if they are unable to comply.

524
00:56:56,168 --> 00:57:06,151
Hate has no home here and masks need to be, much like what a student wears to school, appropriate.

525
00:57:06,971 --> 00:57:10,212
But, you know, we're not going with just solid masks.

526
00:57:11,493 --> 00:57:14,354
I think that would be too much of a burden for families.

527
00:57:14,414 --> 00:57:16,614
If anyone else wants to add to that, feel free.

528
00:57:17,655 --> 00:57:18,995
But I wanted to address that.

529
00:57:22,942 --> 00:57:25,923
There was a question about recess that I can address.

530
00:57:26,664 --> 00:57:38,449
The recess schedules will be made by the building principals, but when we did the hybrid schedule, we did allot time for recess to coincide with lunch for all students.

531
00:57:39,150 --> 00:57:41,751
And, you know, every school is set up differently.

532
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:48,254
The Columbus has two separate areas where one group can go to one side, one can go to the other.

533
00:57:48,855 --> 00:57:57,020
I know all of the buildings don't have that much space around them, but they're going to structure it where students can still play, but do it in a responsible manner.

534
00:58:02,089 --> 00:58:11,354
Okay, so I also want to address that Mr. DeLeva is working to, and Mr. DeLeva is back on.

535
00:58:11,454 --> 00:58:18,378
So I know that you're working on passing time where students can loop around through the exterior of the building.

536
00:58:18,398 --> 00:58:22,480
And I know our middle schools are also looking at this as an option.

537
00:58:23,642 --> 00:58:35,911
So I don't know if Mr. Deliber, you want to address that while not recess at the elementary or walk around the schoolyard, but you know, an opportunity for students to be outside with their masks off for at least some time.

538
00:58:37,592 --> 00:58:41,195
Yeah, the building team, another.

539
00:58:41,664 --> 00:58:49,812
part of that we're trying to go through here is find times where students have the ability to go outside.

540
00:58:50,032 --> 00:58:57,539
There's a discussion regarding lunch as well of being outside and trying to have some mass breaks during that time frame.

541
00:58:58,220 --> 00:59:00,542
Again, it's a little bit different as

542
00:59:01,333 --> 00:59:04,095
You know, we're going more on a on a trust factor.

543
00:59:05,055 --> 00:59:09,418
Usually we have better oversight of students when we're indoors.

544
00:59:09,438 --> 00:59:15,001
But at the same time, this is something that needs to happen because we're in a pandemic.

545
00:59:18,303 --> 00:59:21,425
So we want to make sure that we're getting kids out as much as possible.

546
00:59:22,925 --> 00:59:26,548
And, you know, while still also for that.

547
00:59:30,410 --> 00:59:39,716
So Peter, I want to make sure that realizing that the grounds at the elementary buildings will be open when we come back to school.

548
00:59:40,457 --> 00:59:41,317
It will be outside.

549
00:59:41,357 --> 00:59:42,558
We will be utilizing them.

550
00:59:42,598 --> 00:59:44,919
There will be sanitation procedures happening with them.

551
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:48,001
But we will be creating schedules accordingly.

552
00:59:49,382 --> 00:59:53,545
with the cohort so that we limit the amount of people that are out there at a time.

553
00:59:54,005 --> 01:00:05,493
When we say snack breaks, to me, when we're taking a walk around the schoolyard, that would be one of those breaks built in within the day that we allocate for a mask break.

554
01:00:05,613 --> 01:00:13,758
A teacher may choose to take the students for a quick loop around the building to get their masks off to get a little stretch break to come back in for their masks on.

555
01:00:13,798 --> 01:00:15,379
But we would look at them.

556
01:00:16,808 --> 01:00:27,995
that walk around the schoolyard to address that question would be more of the mask break versus the recess, because the recess will be, we will have our field and our playground open and available to the kids.

557
01:00:31,597 --> 01:00:38,221
Okay.

558
01:00:38,261 --> 01:00:39,321
Just scrolling through the question.

559
01:00:39,341 --> 01:00:40,282
Can I address a question, please?

560
01:00:40,762 --> 01:00:41,382
Absolutely.

561
01:00:41,443 --> 01:00:42,023
Jump right in.

562
01:00:47,875 --> 01:00:53,296
So there's a question regarding three-year evaluations for our special education students.

563
01:00:53,956 --> 01:01:06,098
And when we come back in the fall, reopen in the fall, our goal is to try to do some in-person evaluations with our students, whether it's for educational testing, speech, psychological.

564
01:01:06,178 --> 01:01:08,739
So we will be doing that by appointment only.

565
01:01:09,199 --> 01:01:16,860
And we have ordered shields for desks that when the student is being evaluated, there will be that shield between

566
01:01:17,505 --> 01:01:26,070
the evaluator and the students, so they're our hope for the fall.

567
01:01:26,271 --> 01:01:29,773
So I also want to address Kristen's question that I just found above this.

568
01:01:30,193 --> 01:01:35,136
So will questions not answered here today be considered for inclusion into the Frequently Asked Questions document?

569
01:01:35,196 --> 01:01:37,378
The answer to that is yes.

570
01:01:37,698 --> 01:01:43,922
I'm going to be spending much of the remainder of today compiling the questions that have been in the info at

571
01:01:44,954 --> 01:01:57,426
putting them in a shared Google Doc and moving us towards a document that we can pull together so that everybody can see it.

572
01:01:57,847 --> 01:02:00,429
We will update that document.

573
01:02:02,581 --> 01:02:04,103
it out as soon as possible.

574
01:02:04,704 --> 01:02:14,195
We have received literally hundreds of questions, many of the same questions, and we're going to do our best to answer them all.

575
01:02:16,942 --> 01:02:25,426
There are some questions that people may not like the answers to, but one is we've received is, you know, about my child wearing masks.

576
01:02:26,087 --> 01:02:28,288
Masks are mandatory at Medford public schools.

577
01:02:28,968 --> 01:02:38,273
We are in a public health crisis and we have received some commentary that, you know, that are citing bad science.

578
01:02:39,514 --> 01:03:01,976
to be honest, and we are not going to be able to allow students into the building without masks unless they have a medically documented reason or disability status, and then we'll be looking to provide extra protection, be it shields on desks, face shields, different things, but

579
01:03:03,197 --> 01:03:05,998
We are really going to be requiring masks for students.

580
01:03:06,598 --> 01:03:11,520
Like I said, we're in a public health crisis and we need to do our best to limit the spread.

581
01:03:13,861 --> 01:03:14,841
I just want to try and...

582
01:03:17,807 --> 01:03:21,991
So somebody mentioned about, are we selling masks as a fundraiser?

583
01:03:22,031 --> 01:03:23,112
The answer is we are not.

584
01:03:24,053 --> 01:03:32,842
We simply want to provide an opportunity for masks with Medford branding to be available so students can represent their pride.

585
01:03:34,383 --> 01:03:38,768
And if we can, the youth masks will be available.

586
01:03:39,108 --> 01:03:40,770
I can tell you that they will be available.

587
01:03:41,370 --> 01:03:48,531
And we will do everything possible to provide masks for for our families.

588
01:03:48,651 --> 01:03:50,092
But we're also looking for help.

589
01:03:50,112 --> 01:03:55,973
So if you want to purchase a mask to donate to a student in need, please, we want to make sure that we can.

590
01:03:57,553 --> 01:03:58,013
So.

591
01:03:58,033 --> 01:04:01,213
All right, so.

592
01:04:02,414 --> 01:04:05,514
We will have a decision on before and after school as soon as possible.

593
01:04:06,314 --> 01:04:09,515
We're trying to trying to work all that through, you know,

594
01:04:11,835 --> 01:04:16,017
Um, as we close out here, I'm going to see if any of our panelists want to say anything.

595
01:04:16,077 --> 01:04:18,218
Finally, we're coming up on our time.

596
01:04:18,238 --> 01:04:22,840
Um, I want to say that, uh, before I close out, finally, I just want to say, thank you.

597
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:25,862
I want to thank you for your patience, for your understanding.

598
01:04:26,922 --> 01:04:32,085
Um, we are working honestly, uh, nonstop to try to get this right.

599
01:04:33,045 --> 01:04:39,769
And we want to make sure that we get it as right as possible for everyone involved.

600
01:04:40,470 --> 01:04:46,073
But I want to throw it to the members of the team if you have any final closing words before we head off for our day.

601
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:53,002
I'd like to follow up, Peter, on your closing comment.

602
01:04:53,742 --> 01:05:05,528
Our goal is to keep staff and students safe and healthy, and we will follow all of the Department of Public Health and Board of Health procedures in doing so.

603
01:05:05,988 --> 01:05:16,673
We don't want to expose anybody to any undue risk, and we will be doing our best to maintain health and safety within our buildings for our students and staff.

604
01:05:16,734 --> 01:05:17,434
Thank you, Toni.

605
01:05:19,195 --> 01:05:30,821
I just want to add, you know, we've spent the past couple months trying to look at how we can completely redesign schools in the middle of a pandemic and keep everybody safe and still provide a quality education.

606
01:05:31,642 --> 01:05:34,163
There were some questions about teacher professional development.

607
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:46,768
We are offering professional development for teachers to make this adjustment because we're asking teachers to completely change the way they've taught, whether it's a hybrid model or remote model, this is something completely new.

608
01:05:47,648 --> 01:05:58,155
Prior to getting the extra 10 days front loaded at the beginning of the year, we did opt to take that Tuesday election day and make that a PD day for teachers in August.

609
01:06:00,096 --> 01:06:02,378
They've been given a platform on a,

610
01:06:04,025 --> 01:06:18,319
by a company called Better Lessons, which is specifically designed to support teachers with their instruction in a remote model, a hybrid model, and how they can make that curriculum accessible synchronously and asynchronously.

611
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:24,666
That contract with Better Lessons will go through, even though the training happens in August,

612
01:06:25,308 --> 01:06:28,511
they get to remain on as coaches, I think, through October.

613
01:06:28,611 --> 01:06:38,000
So teachers will still have access to that professional development once they're in the thick of trying to juggle this different style of teaching.

614
01:06:42,444 --> 01:06:44,886
And Peter, if I might just add a couple of comments.

615
01:06:46,962 --> 01:06:52,688
being part of the remote learning model team and planning for the district.

616
01:06:52,788 --> 01:07:02,157
I just want to stress to the families out there that the remote learning academy that is being developed right now and in bargain with the teachers union

617
01:07:03,538 --> 01:07:13,644
is definitely going to be adhering to strict district curriculum initiatives and it's going to be providing the students with the robust engaging academic experience.

618
01:07:13,744 --> 01:07:17,246
It is going to be much different than what we saw in the spring.

619
01:07:17,466 --> 01:07:21,008
There's going to be accountability on the part of the administrator, the teacher,

620
01:07:21,940 --> 01:07:23,262
family caregiver, student.

621
01:07:25,044 --> 01:07:33,455
We are going to be looking into, for the elementary level, a platform called Clever.com.

622
01:07:34,196 --> 01:07:35,718
It streamlines the

623
01:07:37,623 --> 01:07:45,769
ability for the students to get on their apps and their sign-ons to a one logon process.

624
01:07:45,789 --> 01:07:59,960
So I just wanted to have a minute to to encourage the elementary families to look into that Clever system because we're going to be using that clever.com as a platform for our elementary students

625
01:08:01,461 --> 01:08:25,861
As you know, we all have K-12, we'll all have Medford email addresses so that they can access all the educational platforms and applications, but this streamlines that login process and makes it a lot easier for the students to access their learning online, which in turn helps with the families at home that are helping to get them onto that remote learning and that more robust schedule.

626
01:08:29,876 --> 01:08:39,228
And also if I could just add with the better lessons professional development, that wasn't, it's not just for teachers, paraprofessionals and administrators are also participating in this.

627
01:08:39,309 --> 01:08:42,573
So as a district, everybody is on the same page.

628
01:08:47,220 --> 01:08:47,580
All right.

629
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:50,602
So, um, I want to just take one final question.

630
01:08:50,682 --> 01:09:10,755
So, um, it is our goal and hope to put together a parent university, um, with videos and other, um, tutorials, maybe through stream yard, maybe through zoom, however it is, um, to try to make our, uh, to give our parents.

631
01:09:17,258 --> 01:09:22,500
Look, we all know this.

632
01:09:48,743 --> 01:09:56,187
and in the springtime, we were

633
01:10:20,842 --> 01:10:22,023
challenge for you as well.

634
01:10:22,583 --> 01:10:25,264
And we really want to recognize the best.

635
01:10:28,185 --> 01:10:30,006
We're going to end our breads as we come through.

636
01:10:31,006 --> 01:10:36,068
We are going to end our and I thank you.

637
01:10:36,088 --> 01:10:44,811
So we lost Peter.

638
01:10:44,871 --> 01:10:47,272
I'm not sure if everyone can hear me well.

639
01:10:54,212 --> 01:10:59,176
more information and more updates as they become available.

640
01:11:00,157 --> 01:11:00,958
Thank you.

641
01:11:16,892 --> 01:11:19,314
I'm not sure if Dr. Cushing is still

642
01:11:19,780 --> 01:11:27,529
locked out or frozen, but we want to thank everybody who is on this panel for contributing your questions.

643
01:11:27,629 --> 01:11:33,296
We will be taking the questions and putting them into a frequently asked questions and kind of compiling them from the two sessions.

644
01:11:34,237 --> 01:11:35,959
It also gives us something to think about.

645
01:11:35,979 --> 01:11:38,502
The school committee meeting is Thursday night.

646
01:11:40,442 --> 01:11:44,563
you know, please come in attendance and share your views there as well.

647
01:11:44,904 --> 01:11:54,027
We'll be taking all of this feedback to tweak the plans as they have been presented to the Department of Ed, and our final plan goes in, I believe, August 10th.

648
01:11:54,107 --> 01:11:59,089
Thank you very much for attending, and we look forward to continuing this work with you.

649
01:12:02,170 --> 01:12:02,530
Thank you.

650
01:12:03,410 --> 01:12:04,230
Thank you, everyone.

651
01:12:05,031 --> 01:12:05,811
Thank you, everyone.

652
01:12:11,712 --> 01:12:12,793
My apologies there.

653
01:12:13,733 --> 01:12:19,917
So it's the best when your internet fails on you or your computer freezes.

654
01:12:19,937 --> 01:12:25,300
When we're talking about the, talking about going,

655
01:12:37,815 --> 01:13:03,346
remote and those types the thing and the bread I cast now and I appreciate a I appreciate everybody
