1
00:00:00,111 --> 00:00:03,754
[SPEAKER_11]: Superintendent and our Director of Pupil Services among others.

2
00:00:03,794 --> 00:00:04,474
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you.

3
00:00:06,496 --> 00:00:12,800
[SPEAKER_11]: This subcommittee was started a few years ago at the request of the Special Education Parent Advisory Council.

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:20,445
[SPEAKER_11]: Our co-chairs here are here tonight for the Medford Special Ed Parent Advisory Council, Tonya Sullivan, hi Tonya, and Alex Lorick.

5
00:00:22,026 --> 00:00:29,772
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, the subcommittee was started a few years ago with their request in mind to be active participate

6
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:38,201
[SPEAKER_11]: participants in special education concerns and problems of practice to work towards collaborating on policy.

7
00:00:38,261 --> 00:00:39,581
[SPEAKER_11]: We're glad to have them here tonight.

8
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:44,162
[SPEAKER_11]: Our format last year, we had tried during the pandemic to split the meeting.

9
00:00:44,823 --> 00:00:52,964
[SPEAKER_11]: The committee was renamed or reconstituted as the Special Education Behavioral Health Subcommittee.

10
00:00:52,984 --> 00:00:54,165
[SPEAKER_11]: Last year, we were trying to do

11
00:00:55,645 --> 00:00:59,048
[SPEAKER_11]: meetings that were divided between those two topics.

12
00:00:59,268 --> 00:01:10,857
[SPEAKER_11]: And we've decided, based on our meeting last month, we decided to consider a new format for this year, where we are having every other topical meeting.

13
00:01:10,897 --> 00:01:18,943
[SPEAKER_11]: So in other words, the current meeting is special education, next month meeting will be specific to behavioral health, and then we'll

14
00:01:20,637 --> 00:01:33,160
[SPEAKER_11]: stagger each month, every other month for meetings, and that the feeling was that that would give us time in between the meetings to actively work on some of the issues and or concerns that were raised.

15
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:43,083
[SPEAKER_11]: And so in our last meeting, I can share the screen, my screen, and pull up our minutes from the last meeting.

16
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:46,524
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you guys see my screen?

17
00:01:49,607 --> 00:01:49,847
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

18
00:01:50,388 --> 00:01:50,588
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

19
00:01:50,828 --> 00:01:52,270
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

20
00:01:52,390 --> 00:02:11,548
[SPEAKER_11]: And so generally we came to that weren't a lot there was not a lot of participation at that meeting so I just want to go here to highlight sort of what we had been talking about as what we'll look at is the the special education proposed

21
00:02:12,363 --> 00:02:26,932
[SPEAKER_11]: of practice to work on, and then I would like to put the proposed problem of practice out for discussion for the subcommittee to see if there's anything additional folks want to add or something altogether different.

22
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:43,648
[SPEAKER_11]: But essentially it was identifying ways in which to build community and school friendships among our students with and without disabilities, specifically through recreational programming, after school activities and sports organizations, as well as in school meaningful inclusion.

23
00:02:45,062 --> 00:02:49,366
[SPEAKER_11]: along with developing supportive language, recommendations for best practices.

24
00:02:49,446 --> 00:03:08,601
[SPEAKER_11]: So that last sentence sort of comes across what we're seeing in a number of these different entities, recreation, afterschool, sports organizations, is sort of not universal language and perhaps not, although well-intentioned, perhaps not the most

25
00:03:12,597 --> 00:03:15,338
[SPEAKER_11]: thoughtful, I guess, into the disability community.

26
00:03:15,378 --> 00:03:22,822
[SPEAKER_11]: So we want to be aware of how we can make recommendations around some of the printed language we see and maybe some of the other things.

27
00:03:22,862 --> 00:03:33,127
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would encourage folks to just sort of, you know, unmute themselves or if it gets a little too chaotic, which I doubt, we can

28
00:03:34,713 --> 00:03:36,055
[SPEAKER_11]: we can, you know, raise hands.

29
00:03:36,135 --> 00:03:40,059
[SPEAKER_11]: But if folks want to unmute themselves, and if you do, please introduce yourself.

30
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,683
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, because I know we all know each other here, but there may be people watching.

31
00:03:45,305 --> 00:03:45,645
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

32
00:03:45,665 --> 00:03:50,711
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, I'm Tonya Sullivan, co-chair of Medford CPAC.

33
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:51,552
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm also a parent.

34
00:03:52,113 --> 00:03:55,697
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to ask Carla and

35
00:03:56,293 --> 00:04:10,403
[SPEAKER_09]: administration, you know, what is the possibility of have now that we've had unified sports starting, and that's been a huge success, and it's going to be expanding into the middle school and everything, and the adaptive PE.

36
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:19,750
[SPEAKER_09]: Are there any thoughts on doing any type of programming in the summer, like a camp, like a week's camp or something for that?

37
00:04:20,731 --> 00:04:25,915
[SPEAKER_09]: I just was thinking that that might be a good idea on how to collaborate with the community and

38
00:04:28,418 --> 00:04:29,145
[SPEAKER_09]: with the students.

39
00:04:29,767 --> 00:04:54,797
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, typically we have our extended school year programming for our students with disabilities, but I do, you know, we, last year we thought about internally, like how do we add some recreational opportunities for students, some social opportunities for students that is not, you know, IEP related that has to be addressed through extended school year programming.

40
00:04:55,157 --> 00:04:57,718
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's something we should look at

41
00:04:58,078 --> 00:05:06,185
[SPEAKER_07]: to expand upon the unified sports, and to offer some sort of activities recreational activities.

42
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:21,239
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I don't know what it would look like but I do think it's, it's something that I think we should probably have like a work group put together, you know what, what our community members looking for, what would that look like, you know, would it be before.

43
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:26,464
[SPEAKER_07]: extended school year starts because sometimes we have a one or two week break in between.

44
00:05:26,484 --> 00:05:33,750
[SPEAKER_07]: And also how does that, is that something that we work with Medford Recreation, Summer Fun, that sort of thing.

45
00:05:33,811 --> 00:05:46,142
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's a lot of players that we could get, bring to the table to discuss this and what it would look like, but also have the lens of how do we meet our students with disabilities, their needs,

46
00:05:47,404 --> 00:05:49,646
[SPEAKER_07]: But also with their typical pairs as well.

47
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:54,912
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if that's like the, the, the direction that you were thinking Tanya.

48
00:06:00,297 --> 00:06:00,798
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry guys.

49
00:06:01,198 --> 00:06:05,383
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and I'm, we had a meeting last night with Medford recreation and the mayor.

50
00:06:06,168 --> 00:06:11,554
[SPEAKER_09]: And there were several people at that meeting, which is, you know, talking about kind of collaborating.

51
00:06:11,594 --> 00:06:21,444
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just didn't know from an administration point of view what that would look like or, you know, what the regulations are around that.

52
00:06:22,604 --> 00:06:35,193
[SPEAKER_11]: So if I might add, we had a meeting last night with Medford Recreation to discuss adaptive and inclusive programming with Medford Recreation.

53
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:50,443
[SPEAKER_11]: And there was a community member there, Shanine Pelliquin, who's done a lot of work in this area, as you folks probably know, who talked about other districts and how they have worked with recreation departments and summer fun camps to sort of integrate all of these aspects.

54
00:06:51,424 --> 00:07:14,772
[SPEAKER_11]: the students are actually receiving ESY services at the summer fun camp so the kids are getting their ESY service needs met and are also getting their social emotional inclusive needs met and so that was the the basis of the discussion really around you know what what are other communities doing what does it look like how could that look here and I think what we what I heard anyway from that

55
00:07:16,312 --> 00:07:43,850
[SPEAKER_11]: that meeting especially was that you know oftentimes even with the progress that we're making in having a recreation department and having an adaptive program at the recreation department and having an adaptive PE teacher that there's still not meaningful inclusion yet but we know that that's the goal around equity especially because there's so many limits to you know what those programs look like and for example that

56
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:55,881
[SPEAKER_11]: The adaptive programming host about 10 students with disabilities, you know, in one given session, because they're, they're locked out after you know they have so much enrollment.

57
00:07:57,042 --> 00:08:01,306
[SPEAKER_11]: And so, at the same time we know that in the past, special education.

58
00:08:02,577 --> 00:08:12,120
[SPEAKER_11]: school based special education team has been providing training and support to summer fun to ensure.

59
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:19,203
[SPEAKER_11]: Meaningful inclusion, they are so sort of it was it was this popcorn popcorn of ideas of what could this look like across these.

60
00:08:20,243 --> 00:08:28,206
[SPEAKER_11]: You know issues, especially because we see the department does need training around inclusive and therapeutic.

61
00:08:28,994 --> 00:08:41,145
[SPEAKER_11]: recreation therapeutic is different obviously that's more sort of license specific but inclusive, especially using CCSR volunteers and other volunteers, you know there's it's clear that there's certainly well intentioned.

62
00:08:42,326 --> 00:08:46,189
[SPEAKER_11]: volunteers and also there's a need for for training and I know in the past.

63
00:08:48,571 --> 00:08:53,836
[SPEAKER_11]: Kathy was really open to providing that or and or you know, looking to a marker community to us to.

64
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:54,560
[SPEAKER_11]: do that.

65
00:08:54,680 --> 00:09:08,906
[SPEAKER_11]: EMARC does not look like they have, or CUNITAS, which is the local ARC, which is an advocacy group for people with disabilities, does not seem to have much going in the way of recreation right now just because of COVID.

66
00:09:09,626 --> 00:09:11,907
[SPEAKER_13]: So that was a little background for that meeting.

67
00:09:14,308 --> 00:09:14,528
[SPEAKER_13]: Alex?

68
00:09:16,409 --> 00:09:17,569
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so I have a question.

69
00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:19,170
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.

70
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:19,670
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.

71
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:21,351
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'm Alex Lorica.

72
00:09:22,599 --> 00:09:27,662
[SPEAKER_08]: the mom of a teenager with intellectual disabilities and the co-chair of the CPAC.

73
00:09:28,302 --> 00:09:51,093
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm sorry I missed last week, last meeting that maybe this was talk about, but I was wondering what is happening with the goals like of previous years, like two years ago, you know, we talk about disability awareness curriculum and last year we talk about the friendship, the best buddies and maybe bringing Carla's program at middle school.

74
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:52,214
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was wondering what is the,

75
00:09:53,335 --> 00:10:03,312
[SPEAKER_08]: The plan of the subcommittee subcommittee if there is one to kind of keep track of what's going on with those and being people back and monitor progress in some way.

76
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:23,855
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's a great question and I would love to sort of, you know, put that out to, you know, the group because I think some data around, you know, what the progress is for the group is really great and what the recommendations were certainly, you know, we had a recommendation for their disability awareness program and I know Joan can update us on what's happening this year and what the milestones in that program have been.

77
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:29,958
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been really interested in, and I think it's really helpful for us to potentially share out.

78
00:10:30,138 --> 00:10:38,901
[SPEAKER_11]: And when we're talking about policy recommendations at the end of the year, data around evaluations on that program, how people are responding to it, what it looks like, how it's growing.

79
00:10:38,921 --> 00:10:43,983
[SPEAKER_11]: I know Susanna is not here tonight, but she can certainly give an update.

80
00:10:45,064 --> 00:10:51,187
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I'm sure you know that Carla, who was doing the common grounds,

81
00:10:53,002 --> 00:11:02,807
[SPEAKER_11]: reverse inclusion model at the high school with Mr score currency CSR Carla has taken another position as an adaptive are adaptive.

82
00:11:04,845 --> 00:11:06,406
[SPEAKER_11]: PE instructor.

83
00:11:06,446 --> 00:11:14,029
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think the friendship-based one is, especially if that's going to be something we're focusing on for this session, is one that needs to grow.

84
00:11:14,089 --> 00:11:22,853
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think the best buddies was a really great question and initiative that Heather McKinnon, Glennon, and Marissa Isbell had brought before us.

85
00:11:22,893 --> 00:11:32,697
[SPEAKER_11]: And then obviously COVID happened, but I think, you know, you know, that's something that could be worth exploring too, but I'd love to hear what other folks think.

86
00:11:39,067 --> 00:11:41,349
[SPEAKER_13]: Joan, did you want to share about the disability awareness?

87
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:42,390
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

88
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:55,281
[SPEAKER_07]: So several years ago, Susanna Campbell, who is our coordinator, specialty coordinator, but oversees speech and language, has created this disability awareness.

89
00:11:55,701 --> 00:12:00,705
[SPEAKER_07]: First, it was a professional development that was several weeks long or maybe several months long.

90
00:12:01,446 --> 00:12:03,187
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was a really powerful,

91
00:12:04,329 --> 00:12:08,815
[SPEAKER_07]: presentation I know Melanie had, she provides.

92
00:12:10,573 --> 00:12:13,134
[SPEAKER_07]: background regarding disabilities.

93
00:12:13,174 --> 00:12:17,877
[SPEAKER_07]: We also have parents, we have students that come to talk about disabilities.

94
00:12:18,397 --> 00:12:27,221
[SPEAKER_07]: And then after that disability awareness came out, the disability, the need for a disability awareness curriculum in our schools.

95
00:12:28,042 --> 00:12:33,965
[SPEAKER_07]: So CPAC has been fighting and really wanting to have this within our schools.

96
00:12:34,525 --> 00:12:38,449
[SPEAKER_07]: So this year we are piloting the disability awareness curriculum.

97
00:12:38,769 --> 00:12:40,591
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe it's at three different grade levels.

98
00:12:40,631 --> 00:12:43,233
[SPEAKER_07]: There's elementary, a middle and a high school level.

99
00:12:44,134 --> 00:12:50,020
[SPEAKER_07]: And each level is being introduced to one type of disability.

100
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:58,307
[SPEAKER_07]: And we hope to expand that over the course of the year so that when a student starts at kindergarten, by the time they finish in grade 12,

101
00:12:59,168 --> 00:13:07,033
[SPEAKER_07]: They have learned about all these different disabilities in a natural way in the classroom.

102
00:13:07,573 --> 00:13:09,375
[SPEAKER_07]: There are social stories.

103
00:13:09,495 --> 00:13:13,297
[SPEAKER_07]: There are specific books that have been selected to do this.

104
00:13:14,298 --> 00:13:18,781
[SPEAKER_07]: So that is where the disability awareness curriculum came out of.

105
00:13:18,801 --> 00:13:21,582
[SPEAKER_07]: And I believe that Susanna will continue to do

106
00:13:22,483 --> 00:13:28,366
[SPEAKER_07]: her disability awareness workshop in the early spring as she has done before.

107
00:13:29,027 --> 00:13:38,812
[SPEAKER_07]: So we continue to recommend that, you know, all staff, administrators, people really take part in it because it is very powerful.

108
00:13:40,633 --> 00:13:45,957
[SPEAKER_11]: So, and I would say, you know, we'll make sure that we ask Susanna to be on the next

109
00:13:48,117 --> 00:14:08,583
[SPEAKER_11]: subcommittee meeting to talk about this more if you like, but I would also say, you know, that we can encourage data collection around what that's looking like so that at the end of the year, again, for the policy recommendations, you know, we have some measurable data if we want, if we intend to recommend expanding it at all.

110
00:14:09,353 --> 00:14:18,096
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep, and I think that's what Susanna is sorry Alex what she's working on to is, you know, getting that data getting the feedback from the teachers.

111
00:14:19,397 --> 00:14:31,181
[SPEAKER_07]: As to what's being implemented this year, maybe getting feedback on you know what's working what's not working is there anything that we need to revise going forward, but I will definitely talk to her about.

112
00:14:31,981 --> 00:14:38,928
[SPEAKER_07]: getting some data collection and presenting to the subcommittee, maybe, you know, an update on where we're at right now.

113
00:14:39,529 --> 00:14:51,000
[SPEAKER_07]: And then at the end of the, at the end of the close of the school year, you know, what's been done, how it was received, maybe get feedback from the teachers, the students, that sort of thing.

114
00:14:53,076 --> 00:15:02,482
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and I wanted to let people know that in January, Susanna is gonna present for the CPAC on disability awareness curriculum and progress with that.

115
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:10,327
[SPEAKER_08]: And a question that I have, and I don't know, John, if you know about this, but maybe something that we could ask Susanna at some point.

116
00:15:11,068 --> 00:15:20,734
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a discussion of involving maybe curriculum directors with this or how we can really, how we can place this

117
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:22,972
[SPEAKER_08]: as part of the curriculum.

118
00:15:22,992 --> 00:15:25,053
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't know if that happened already or not.

119
00:15:25,173 --> 00:15:28,594
[SPEAKER_08]: We were talking maybe ELA or social studies or things like that.

120
00:15:29,435 --> 00:15:40,339
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe Susanna has spoken to our director of humanities, but I can follow up on that to see what the status is because this is happening in the classrooms right now.

121
00:15:40,419 --> 00:15:51,803
[SPEAKER_07]: And I do think she reached out to Dr. Chiesa regarding the books that were selected, that there's a conversation that this is what's happening, but we can get an update regarding that as well.

122
00:15:54,383 --> 00:15:54,983
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

123
00:15:55,103 --> 00:15:59,446
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just want to recognize our subcommittee member.

124
00:15:59,706 --> 00:15:59,846
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

125
00:15:59,866 --> 00:16:00,907
[SPEAKER_11]: Stone has joined us.

126
00:16:01,107 --> 00:16:02,168
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for joining, Mia.

127
00:16:02,888 --> 00:16:06,330
[SPEAKER_11]: We're just discussing the goals for this year.

128
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:19,438
[SPEAKER_11]: In the past, we've worked on disability awareness and improving friendships through after school, before school, after school, sports and recreation.

129
00:16:19,738 --> 00:16:22,100
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're identifying what the

130
00:16:23,137 --> 00:16:32,565
[SPEAKER_11]: And what we're referring to is problem of practice that we want to work on this year as a subcommittee to move forward policy recommendations at the end of the year.

131
00:16:34,386 --> 00:16:51,661
[SPEAKER_11]: And the other question that was mentioned, so we were just talking about the disability awareness curriculum that this group worked with Susanna Campbell on and has been received really well in the community among staff and just having some data collection around what that looks like.

132
00:16:52,790 --> 00:17:08,737
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the other question that you had, Alex, was an update on the inclusion, meaningful inclusion in schools, which was, you know, we had been discussing last year the model that was used at the high school, which was the Common Ground Program.

133
00:17:08,797 --> 00:17:21,002
[SPEAKER_11]: And Carla, Andre, and Michael Skorka were using that program, which was essentially a reverse inclusion model where the CCSR class was coming in, I think, monthly into the access class.

134
00:17:22,547 --> 00:17:24,468
[SPEAKER_11]: with some specific goals.

135
00:17:24,628 --> 00:17:29,631
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm just wondering if Carla can update us on, I know Carla, I'm sure folks know Carla, Ms.

136
00:17:29,691 --> 00:17:35,914
[SPEAKER_11]: Andre took a position as the adaptive PE instructor, which we're very pleased to have an adaptive PE program.

137
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:41,617
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'm wondering, to that point, you know, does Common Ground still exist as far as anybody knows?

138
00:17:42,285 --> 00:17:44,026
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, it still exists.

139
00:17:44,466 --> 00:17:46,567
[SPEAKER_10]: I was actually in there the other day.

140
00:17:46,847 --> 00:17:52,049
[SPEAKER_10]: And Joan, I'm not sure if you know the name of the program, but I know it's kind of like an outdoorsy program.

141
00:17:52,069 --> 00:17:55,651
[SPEAKER_10]: And they came in and they took the, all the kids went into the woods.

142
00:17:55,931 --> 00:17:56,671
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you know that it was it?

143
00:17:57,031 --> 00:17:58,072
[SPEAKER_10]: Friends of the fells.

144
00:17:58,472 --> 00:18:00,273
[SPEAKER_09]: Waypoint Adventures.

145
00:18:00,653 --> 00:18:02,154
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Waypoint Adventures Charlotte.

146
00:18:02,714 --> 00:18:04,055
[SPEAKER_09]: And they went into the fells, Joan.

147
00:18:04,075 --> 00:18:04,815
[SPEAKER_09]: So yes, you're right.

148
00:18:07,103 --> 00:18:14,210
[SPEAKER_10]: So I know that was something they did during one of their common ground activities which is great that's a great idea that to you know pair with organizations like that.

149
00:18:15,411 --> 00:18:21,698
[SPEAKER_10]: And it, they're coming into the classroom twice a cycle so the way that we run an A through F day.

150
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:25,161
[SPEAKER_10]: So it ends up being several times a month I would say.

151
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:34,727
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, when the new teacher came into that role, it was, it was very specifically told that this the program would continue.

152
00:18:34,747 --> 00:18:38,469
[SPEAKER_10]: And I, you know, as far as I know, it is continuing very successfully.

153
00:18:38,529 --> 00:18:42,831
[SPEAKER_10]: And maybe Tanya can speak a little bit on that, as she is a student in that class.

154
00:18:43,211 --> 00:18:54,777
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't know the details, aside from from, you know, that that one class that I was in so far, I'm working on getting in there a bit more, because we want to see it continue and spread to other levels too.

155
00:18:56,596 --> 00:18:58,916
[SPEAKER_09]: I will say that they've definitely been having it.

156
00:18:59,317 --> 00:19:01,857
[SPEAKER_09]: Like you said, Carla, it's still continuing twice a cycle.

157
00:19:02,737 --> 00:19:04,458
[SPEAKER_09]: They're doing a lot of different activities.

158
00:19:04,938 --> 00:19:14,440
[SPEAKER_09]: And the Waypoint Adventure was actually one that CPAC sponsored for the kids to be able to do the hike and the fells with team building exercises.

159
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,820
[SPEAKER_09]: So it is definitely continuing.

160
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:24,102
[SPEAKER_09]: And I will definitely make sure that that's happening in that class anyway.

161
00:19:26,542 --> 00:19:28,963
[SPEAKER_09]: but I'm not sure what they have scheduled coming up.

162
00:19:30,844 --> 00:19:52,897
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think one of the reasons that we had talked about as a subcommittee about, you know, the best buddy program at the middle school was that we were talking about, you know, this, and again, this is reverse inclusion, to be clear, this is not inclusion, you know, so reverse inclusion is, as we said, you know, kids without disabilities coming into a

163
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,342
[SPEAKER_11]: already subseparate classroom.

164
00:19:55,382 --> 00:19:59,846
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's not inclusion in the community or inclusion in a general education setting.

165
00:20:00,286 --> 00:20:01,567
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a reverse inclusion model.

166
00:20:01,908 --> 00:20:09,474
[SPEAKER_11]: But we had talked about, you know, or we had family members who had talked about wanting to expand or see things at the middle school level.

167
00:20:10,015 --> 00:20:12,637
[SPEAKER_11]: And so that was some of the discussion that we had had last year.

168
00:20:12,697 --> 00:20:13,258
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I guess

169
00:20:14,036 --> 00:20:28,742
[SPEAKER_11]: the purpose of this meeting really is to identify if that's something that we want to continue to explore as a problem of practice for this group and what that would look like, or if there's something else that folks want to focus on for a problem of practice this year.

170
00:20:28,782 --> 00:20:33,924
[SPEAKER_11]: So just to get us back on agenda topic, I want to make sure that that's what we're discussing.

171
00:20:40,667 --> 00:20:42,388
[SPEAKER_09]: I think what Alex had said about kind of

172
00:20:43,252 --> 00:20:50,594
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, reassessing what the goals were in the past and, um, making sure that they don't just drop off as we get new goals.

173
00:20:51,115 --> 00:21:04,859
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe, maybe revisiting what the goals have been for the past a couple of years, uh, you know, kind of to see where we ended up with those and if we were happy with that, I'm, I

174
00:21:05,538 --> 00:21:10,400
[SPEAKER_09]: I think at least for like the best buddies, I don't know that anything's been done, um, with that.

175
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:22,405
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know that COVID has, has, you know, kind of put a pause on some of that stuff, but I think we, I don't, I don't really think we should drop it.

176
00:21:23,225 --> 00:21:27,247
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't think we should continue with even more goals.

177
00:21:28,007 --> 00:21:34,190
[SPEAKER_09]: If we want to definitely keep the goals going that we already had, that we have, that have not come to fruition.

178
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:37,266
[SPEAKER_09]: Just my thought.

179
00:21:39,948 --> 00:21:40,408
[SPEAKER_11]: I hear you.

180
00:21:40,608 --> 00:21:46,653
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that if so, if we want to, oh, sorry, member Rousseau.

181
00:21:47,634 --> 00:21:49,995
[SPEAKER_05]: I just feel a little uncomfortable that this is a subcommittee.

182
00:21:50,015 --> 00:21:52,758
[SPEAKER_05]: We can't direct anybody to do anything at all, ever.

183
00:21:53,838 --> 00:21:56,921
[SPEAKER_05]: We can send recommendations to the full committee to vote.

184
00:21:57,761 --> 00:22:04,687
[SPEAKER_05]: And I feel like in this particular meeting, we're often doing and saying things as if the committee has spoken and it has not.

185
00:22:06,488 --> 00:22:16,476
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I have no concerns about, you know, the goals and making sure we don't just drop last year's goals I think that's a terrible way to to improve the district.

186
00:22:16,876 --> 00:22:21,700
[SPEAKER_05]: I just think it's important to note that until the full committee, get something to vote on.

187
00:22:22,801 --> 00:22:24,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody should be doing anything based on what we're talking about here.

188
00:22:25,818 --> 00:22:39,222
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, unless we ask for some data or something, but you know, like nobody should be changing curriculums or implementing a class program, you know, that we've just, we're talking about, sorry, I forget the name of it.

189
00:22:40,822 --> 00:22:42,362
[SPEAKER_11]: Disability Awareness Curriculum.

190
00:22:42,443 --> 00:22:44,103
[SPEAKER_11]: And we did vote on it last year.

191
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:46,351
[SPEAKER_11]: So nobody's changing anything.

192
00:22:46,371 --> 00:22:49,473
[SPEAKER_11]: This was voted on last year to continue the disability awareness curriculum.

193
00:22:49,513 --> 00:22:59,820
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think the committee recognizes that this is a subcommittee and that we bring our discussion to the committee after this meeting with our minutes.

194
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:02,582
[SPEAKER_11]: And then if there's items that need to be voted on, that we vote on them.

195
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:12,008
[SPEAKER_11]: So I don't think anybody's getting the impression that, you know, we're just moving ahead without any school committee approval, but I appreciate your concern.

196
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:16,503
[SPEAKER_05]: If I may, I know that we vote on the minutes.

197
00:23:16,883 --> 00:23:31,237
[SPEAKER_05]: I just don't see motions added coming out of our meeting to adopt a new policy or to just simply make a motion to, for instance, implement this program across a certain number of classrooms and levels.

198
00:23:31,918 --> 00:23:35,201
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, I think this committee

199
00:23:36,508 --> 00:23:41,609
[SPEAKER_05]: could make a recommendation that in the following year to expand it based on our success from the last year.

200
00:23:42,989 --> 00:23:47,850
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't think that being embedded in minutes is not an approval by the committee to do anything.

201
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:59,333
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we have to just try to write the words, because we have to write the words and this subcommittee agree to the words, and then they can be sent up as approved by the subcommittee.

202
00:23:59,353 --> 00:24:00,953
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just don't see that happening.

203
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:14,482
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I think that what we do is at the end of the year, we make policy recommendations that are voted on by the subcommittee, but it's not our position as school committee to be making, in my opinion, curriculum recommendations per se.

204
00:24:14,822 --> 00:24:19,967
[SPEAKER_11]: That is, you know, the Director of Pupil Services and others have worked to create this disability curriculum.

205
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:24,992
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not up to the school committee, as far as I understand, to approve or disapprove of it.

206
00:24:25,512 --> 00:24:40,409
[SPEAKER_11]: But we have made motions at the end of the year that our policy recommendations that we say we think that this disability awareness curriculum is appropriate and that, you know, as experts in the field of disability both as with lived experience and professional experience we make recommendations.

207
00:24:42,531 --> 00:24:43,212
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember my stone.

208
00:24:46,185 --> 00:24:46,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

209
00:24:46,966 --> 00:24:54,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I was thinking just having two girls at the Andrews and how popular so many of the clubs are.

210
00:24:55,491 --> 00:25:03,196
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that the CCSR is partnering with a mom who's teaching a sewing class to

211
00:25:04,488 --> 00:25:13,251
[SPEAKER_04]: create toiletry bags, and then collect goods to stuff in the toiletry bags to give to the Bread of Life in Malden for their guests.

212
00:25:13,691 --> 00:25:17,152
[SPEAKER_04]: So I didn't know, back to Tonya was talking about the buddy program.

213
00:25:17,332 --> 00:25:32,017
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know if that could be a place that all kids could come together, pack the bags with their peers, and then follow up with maybe doing service projects together in conjunction with the buddy program.

214
00:25:34,059 --> 00:25:35,300
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if that would be something that.

215
00:25:39,624 --> 00:25:40,005
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

216
00:25:40,605 --> 00:25:54,559
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I think that's a great idea and especially with service project with CCSR and partnership at the middle school level and that was part of what the committee had been discussing how to expand to middle school, you know, some inclusive practice, particularly in these, you know,

217
00:25:55,733 --> 00:26:02,237
[SPEAKER_11]: in these experiences where it was, you know, CCSR activities or wraparound activities.

218
00:26:03,038 --> 00:26:07,280
[SPEAKER_11]: And we had a few family members that wanted to explore the Best Buddies option.

219
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,141
[SPEAKER_11]: They had met with Best Buddies.

220
00:26:09,201 --> 00:26:10,282
[SPEAKER_11]: I had met with them as well.

221
00:26:11,139 --> 00:26:13,921
[SPEAKER_11]: It had suddenly become much more affordable than it has in the past.

222
00:26:14,382 --> 00:26:29,193
[SPEAKER_11]: And then this committee sort of was looking at the discussion of the common ground model at the high school and sort of looking at that as expanding to the middle school and using our internal resources as opposed to going outside to a best buddy program.

223
00:26:29,234 --> 00:26:30,675
[SPEAKER_11]: And so that's where we left off.

224
00:26:31,215 --> 00:26:37,400
[SPEAKER_11]: And what I'm hearing the CPAC, Tanya and Alex saying is that

225
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:51,532
[SPEAKER_11]: since those things have not really been moved forward, that they would still like to focus on what that actually could be and look like as a collective policy recommendation problem or practice that we look at at this school level.

226
00:26:51,632 --> 00:26:57,978
[SPEAKER_11]: So this meeting is really to identify if that's what this subcommittee would like to work on.

227
00:26:58,695 --> 00:27:04,077
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think those are great ideas in terms of if like we do want to work on a best buddies, you know, and suggest like do some.

228
00:27:04,457 --> 00:27:11,699
[SPEAKER_11]: And, and to be clear, what we do is we research the ideas, and we come before the subcommittee and discuss them as a community group.

229
00:27:12,099 --> 00:27:21,302
[SPEAKER_11]: And then if there are ideas that we think are valuable, we move them forward for a motion as a policy recommendation if needed to the school committee.

230
00:27:27,304 --> 00:27:28,345
[SPEAKER_13]: But I love that idea, Mia.

231
00:27:28,425 --> 00:27:30,247
[SPEAKER_11]: I think getting the CCSR involved would be great.

232
00:27:31,848 --> 00:27:48,343
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess just to move forward, could I work with someone at the Andrews Middle School to at least get, I think this will be a short, successful service project that we could have all kids involved.

233
00:27:49,565 --> 00:27:59,448
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if anyone wants, I don't know if I'm overstepping or if that's something I can reach out and work with the teachers at the Andrews.

234
00:28:01,769 --> 00:28:12,973
[SPEAKER_12]: So I would probably say what would be most appropriate would be if through the, I'm not sure who the respective teachers are that are doing the CCSR.

235
00:28:14,023 --> 00:28:15,404
[SPEAKER_04]: It's miss been doing.

236
00:28:15,424 --> 00:28:34,921
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just, I think it's, it's, it's nice because the kids will have, they'll be able to see their impact so the sewing club is going to make the toiletry bags, and then they're going to do a drive for you know, little toothpaste or deodorant or what have you, they have a list from bread of life, it will go into the spring.

237
00:28:35,822 --> 00:28:42,924
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, and I think it will just be a few, probably a few days that we'll meet after school to compile the toiletry bags and then pack up my van.

238
00:28:44,345 --> 00:28:49,827
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think it'd be a great place for kids to be together and doing something fun and service to the community.

239
00:28:49,847 --> 00:29:00,130
[SPEAKER_12]: So I can do it to do for myself to also follow up with Mr. Skorka on that one as well.

240
00:29:00,911 --> 00:29:04,652
[SPEAKER_12]: And coordinate that as a community service learning project.

241
00:29:05,628 --> 00:29:10,733
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I just don't know if there's teachers, Joan, you would know who the best teachers are to invite?

242
00:29:10,753 --> 00:29:20,983
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to say, if you want to connect with me as well, and I can get the information, you know, the days of the week, the hours, how many students you're looking for.

243
00:29:21,564 --> 00:29:28,751
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I can reach out to the special education staff at the Andrews to promote that and to encourage students to participate.

244
00:29:29,171 --> 00:29:33,174
[SPEAKER_04]: And this literally just started in an email yesterday so we are fresh, you know, we're not.

245
00:29:33,814 --> 00:29:39,197
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not joining something that's happening it's just just an email started yesterday so we are all together at the beginning.

246
00:29:39,758 --> 00:29:40,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, good.

247
00:29:45,141 --> 00:29:47,282
[SPEAKER_12]: get the bags delivered before the holidays?

248
00:29:47,382 --> 00:29:56,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that the- I don't think so because they'll have to have a while to sew and the mom who sews has two groups because she only has 14 sewing machines.

249
00:29:56,625 --> 00:30:00,926
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think she'll be a while before all the sewing kids will be able to sew their own toiletry bags.

250
00:30:00,946 --> 00:30:02,467
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm thinking probably more of the spring.

251
00:30:02,947 --> 00:30:03,187
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

252
00:30:04,768 --> 00:30:08,849
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think this is, Mia, this is an afterschool project, right?

253
00:30:09,029 --> 00:30:09,889
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, yes.

254
00:30:10,149 --> 00:30:11,830
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so- So is that a hiccup?

255
00:30:12,722 --> 00:30:14,023
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I mean, that's great.

256
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:27,389
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been also exploring ways of inclusion, reverse inclusion during the school day, because I think, for instance, transportation, it might be a barrier for students with disabilities.

257
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:37,334
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, John, I don't even know if you know how many students with disability participate in after school because they have some have the special transportation and things like that.

258
00:30:37,754 --> 00:30:41,496
[SPEAKER_08]: So I was wondering if we could maybe at least part of that can

259
00:30:42,209 --> 00:30:45,511
[SPEAKER_08]: explore ways to do it during the school day maybe.

260
00:30:45,531 --> 00:30:46,492
[SPEAKER_08]: Definitely.

261
00:30:46,592 --> 00:30:55,857
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, maybe in collaboration with the principals or whatever, so we can make the access of students with disabilities a little bit more easier.

262
00:30:57,147 --> 00:31:03,673
[SPEAKER_07]: Just to point out that transportation shouldn't be a barrier for students being able to participate in these programs.

263
00:31:03,733 --> 00:31:13,902
[SPEAKER_07]: So students with disabilities who have specialized transportation, they should stay after school and the transportation would be provided for them.

264
00:31:14,302 --> 00:31:18,766
[SPEAKER_07]: We would need to know ahead of time how many students require transportation.

265
00:31:18,786 --> 00:31:22,830
[SPEAKER_07]: We'd have to arrange it through my office, but I just want to be clear that

266
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:31,135
[SPEAKER_07]: If there's a student with a disability that has specialized transportation, they have every right to access any extracurricular activities.

267
00:31:31,755 --> 00:31:32,055
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

268
00:31:32,596 --> 00:31:32,816
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

269
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:41,041
[SPEAKER_07]: And we would highly encourage it, but it just does take a little bit of planning to set it up.

270
00:31:41,161 --> 00:31:51,567
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we can communicate regarding that, and then we can find out how many students want to sign up and then who requires transportation, we would look at that.

271
00:31:52,107 --> 00:31:54,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, then I'll email you tomorrow, Joan.

272
00:31:54,751 --> 00:31:55,432
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, sounds good.

273
00:31:55,453 --> 00:31:56,695
[SPEAKER_04]: And whoever else wants to be on the email.

274
00:31:56,735 --> 00:31:57,536
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll email everybody.

275
00:31:57,556 --> 00:32:02,765
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you, Mia.

276
00:32:02,785 --> 00:32:04,107
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a really thoughtful idea.

277
00:32:04,247 --> 00:32:05,108
[SPEAKER_11]: And I love Bread Alife.

278
00:32:05,148 --> 00:32:05,890
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a great program.

279
00:32:08,382 --> 00:32:20,107
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, I think that there's a number of, you know, issues as we were talking about before school, after school, athletics, recreation, all of those things.

280
00:32:20,187 --> 00:32:30,052
[SPEAKER_11]: And to your point, Joan, you know, removing barriers for students with disabilities is a big part of what the subcommittee is really about and how to move these issues forward.

281
00:32:30,112 --> 00:32:34,294
[SPEAKER_11]: So again, I would like to just put to the floor

282
00:32:35,965 --> 00:32:46,314
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, you know, I don't know if folks want to, you know, again, have a couple of recommendations to suggest and then we can ask.

283
00:32:48,255 --> 00:32:53,159
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I don't think that we need approval from the school committee to have a problem with practice for our school subcommittee.

284
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:54,220
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm not going to suggest that.

285
00:32:54,801 --> 00:32:58,724
[SPEAKER_11]: But I don't know here if you want to if there's anyone else that has recommendations on what

286
00:32:59,325 --> 00:33:03,427
[SPEAKER_11]: would like to work on for this particular year.

287
00:33:03,447 --> 00:33:17,675
[SPEAKER_11]: And what I'm hearing from our CPAC co-chairs, and I guess maybe we could do a raise of hands, are folks wanting to continue to work on meaningful inclusion in building

288
00:33:19,042 --> 00:33:30,193
[SPEAKER_11]: friendships, and in and out of school, I guess, you know, through the programming that we discussed already, as the problem of practice, and if so, you know, maybe a raise of hands.

289
00:33:30,233 --> 00:33:35,879
[SPEAKER_11]: And if there's if you are not interested in doing that, maybe a thumbs down, and people can talk about something else that they'd like to do.

290
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:36,599
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not really sure.

291
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,081
[SPEAKER_11]: We did meet last month.

292
00:33:38,181 --> 00:33:43,526
[SPEAKER_11]: And Joan, you know, had thought that, and I want to speak for you, Joan, but you know, in the meeting that we have last month,

293
00:33:44,093 --> 00:33:59,079
[SPEAKER_11]: there was the discussion that, you know, continuing this work because we had a pandemic year, because we had, you know, the things, Carla moved on to another position and some other things that maybe we continue to explore as a group some of the options that we've discussed.

294
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:10,664
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, Mia gave a really great example of a, of an afterschool program model that could have some inclusion, but, or some model of inclusion, but, you know, again, we were looking at other, you know,

295
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:20,774
[SPEAKER_11]: entities and aspects and specifically the best buddies, you know, we're meeting again in two months, our next meeting is January for this group.

296
00:34:21,134 --> 00:34:36,460
[SPEAKER_11]: So maybe between now and January, we can be, you know, potentially doing some research on the best buddies, we can be looking at CCSR and what they're doing, if anything around disability projects, we can also be talking to, you know,

297
00:34:37,403 --> 00:34:42,866
[SPEAKER_11]: Susanna Campbell, I'm looking at what has happened in that realm with the Disability Awareness Program.

298
00:34:42,886 --> 00:34:50,791
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, these are a couple of the things that I'm thinking that are follow-ups to what we had been working on last year.

299
00:34:50,851 --> 00:35:06,260
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, this culminates in that end of year meeting where we bring issues to the school committee, aside from advising them and letting them know about our meeting content, where we bring issues at the end of the year that we put forward for policy if needed.

300
00:35:08,177 --> 00:35:10,778
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we wanna have a hands up, thumbs down?

301
00:35:14,219 --> 00:35:16,059
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, Mia, did you say yes?

302
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,460
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm yes for our friendships.

303
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:19,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

304
00:35:22,341 --> 00:35:25,842
[SPEAKER_03]: My favorite quote, quote, there's no strangers, just friends you haven't met yet.

305
00:35:26,983 --> 00:35:29,964
[SPEAKER_11]: That is a nice Mia Mustone quote.

306
00:35:33,385 --> 00:35:34,505
[SPEAKER_11]: Good, well, that's good.

307
00:35:34,625 --> 00:35:37,366
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think maybe we could think about, again, I wanna look at our,

308
00:35:42,818 --> 00:35:43,859
[SPEAKER_13]: You're on mute, Melanie.

309
00:35:44,419 --> 00:35:45,039
[SPEAKER_13]: You got muted.

310
00:35:48,781 --> 00:35:50,922
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, I just said I wanted to look at our calendar.

311
00:35:51,322 --> 00:35:52,443
[SPEAKER_13]: So bear with me one second.

312
00:36:11,728 --> 00:36:13,660
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so we have.

313
00:36:17,678 --> 00:36:25,240
[SPEAKER_11]: December 16th is the behavioral health session that will have a similar type meeting as we did tonight to confirm what the goal is for the year.

314
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:46,505
[SPEAKER_11]: And there was discussion that Stacey had just mentioning that maybe it goes like a January to January because we're already into the year that the goal sort of, you know, is a January to January sort of process, but we can talk about that for policy recommendations specifically, you know, because end of the year in June, then we're gone for the summer.

315
00:36:46,545 --> 00:36:47,565
[SPEAKER_11]: And then it's looking at sort of

316
00:36:48,025 --> 00:37:11,498
[SPEAKER_11]: How is the policy being implemented or is it being implemented, you know, starting up again so that's something to consider, but January 20 is our next special education topic driven meeting so between now and January 20, it gives us sort of two months if we, you know, are interested in working on some of these issues or goals and so

317
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:25,244
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm okay with reaching out to the two family members that were interested in exploring the Best Buddies program and doing some of the research around that and seeing what that entails and what that looks like.

318
00:37:25,304 --> 00:37:28,565
[SPEAKER_11]: And I can bring that back to the subcommittee and report that out.

319
00:37:30,305 --> 00:37:39,928
[SPEAKER_11]: Mia, maybe Member McStone, if you wouldn't mind coming back and letting us know on the 20th about this Bread of Life program.

320
00:37:41,447 --> 00:37:45,208
[SPEAKER_11]: how that progressed in terms of an afterschool project, that would be really helpful.

321
00:37:46,249 --> 00:37:53,811
[SPEAKER_11]: Did somebody say that they were able to reach out to CCSR or were going to reach out to Mr. Skorka, was that you, Dr. Edward Vincent?

322
00:37:54,331 --> 00:37:54,751
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

323
00:37:55,211 --> 00:37:55,651
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

324
00:37:57,032 --> 00:38:07,575
[SPEAKER_11]: Particularly about the middle school stuff, but I also have an appointment scheduled with Mr. Skorka to talk about what disability-related projects the students have come up with, because I know that they've come up specifically with projects, so I would love to

325
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:09,070
[SPEAKER_11]: talk with them more.

326
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:12,012
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, Kate was on the call.

327
00:38:12,112 --> 00:38:12,932
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah, Kate's on the call.

328
00:38:12,952 --> 00:38:13,413
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, hi, Kate.

329
00:38:13,433 --> 00:38:14,373
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't see your hand was raised.

330
00:38:14,953 --> 00:38:15,994
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me let you talk.

331
00:38:16,034 --> 00:38:16,314
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

332
00:38:18,475 --> 00:38:20,476
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you would you mind just introducing yourself to please?

333
00:38:21,036 --> 00:38:21,437
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

334
00:38:26,339 --> 00:38:29,100
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys can you guys hear me?

335
00:38:30,821 --> 00:38:31,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, guys.

336
00:38:31,202 --> 00:38:33,583
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Kate Quinn program manager with recreation department.

337
00:38:33,623 --> 00:38:33,963
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I was

338
00:38:34,638 --> 00:38:36,640
[SPEAKER_02]: In late, I couldn't get on, but it finally got in.

339
00:38:38,321 --> 00:38:39,982
[SPEAKER_02]: I missed a little bit of everything.

340
00:38:40,022 --> 00:38:45,526
[SPEAKER_02]: I was raising my hand to vote for inclusion for you.

341
00:38:45,846 --> 00:38:46,047
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

342
00:38:48,041 --> 00:38:48,781
[SPEAKER_11]: Yay, inclusion.

343
00:38:48,861 --> 00:38:49,322
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, good.

344
00:38:49,382 --> 00:38:49,942
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks, Kate.

345
00:38:50,383 --> 00:39:01,611
[SPEAKER_11]: So, and Metro Recreation has, as the CPAC mentioned, been working around some of these topics that we've discussed around, you know, meaningful inclusion and how to expand that with the meeting that we had last night.

346
00:39:01,691 --> 00:39:06,635
[SPEAKER_11]: And so that is going to be followed up on, Tanya and Alex, right?

347
00:39:07,716 --> 00:39:10,098
[SPEAKER_11]: As the meeting was discussed last night, there's going to be another

348
00:39:10,918 --> 00:39:22,262
[SPEAKER_11]: meeting Kate, I'm sure Danny and Kevin have likely looped you in around some of the questions that were really raised last night on how to improve and increase that meaningful inclusion.

349
00:39:22,322 --> 00:39:36,426
[SPEAKER_11]: So maybe if I could delegate if folks are willing that Kate, Tanya and Alex might come back on January 20th with some update on the collaboration on the meaningful inclusion with the recreation.

350
00:39:37,329 --> 00:39:37,849
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.

351
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:39,050
[SPEAKER_11]: Would that be okay?

352
00:39:40,031 --> 00:39:41,012
[SPEAKER_11]: So January 20th?

353
00:39:41,692 --> 00:39:41,972
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

354
00:39:43,773 --> 00:39:56,882
[SPEAKER_11]: And then if I understand correctly, Joan, you were going to circle back with Susanna to have her come back to us on the disability awareness piece and what the progress of that has been.

355
00:39:56,902 --> 00:40:06,149
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I guess when we meet on January 20th, we can sort of think about what the next steps are for moving some of these problems with practice forward for

356
00:40:08,181 --> 00:40:17,308
[SPEAKER_11]: Future discussion, is there anything else Miss Carla is there anything that you wanted to Carla I also just wanted to recognize you and say thank you so much for the unified sports program.

357
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:21,192
[SPEAKER_11]: that has been such good medicine, really exciting to watch.

358
00:40:21,992 --> 00:40:34,298
[SPEAKER_11]: Going to the pizza party the other night and seeing the neurotypical peers with our students with disabilities and everyone getting medals and shirts with their names on it and everything.

359
00:40:34,338 --> 00:40:35,479
[SPEAKER_11]: It was just like the best.

360
00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:39,281
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually literally heard from a staff member say that it was

361
00:40:41,387 --> 00:40:50,450
[SPEAKER_11]: It was the best, the single best experience the staff member has had in our schools in the past 20 months during this pandemic.

362
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:52,771
[SPEAKER_11]: And I thought that that was really quite remarkable.

363
00:40:53,271 --> 00:40:59,933
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know that it's gonna continue to grow and expand and I'm excited by that and really, really grateful to have you in that role.

364
00:41:00,033 --> 00:41:00,433
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

365
00:41:01,185 --> 00:41:01,605
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

366
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:10,594
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I think it was great that we had such a successful first year because they can only get bigger and better from here, just the amount of people that came to the games we had so much support.

367
00:41:11,414 --> 00:41:20,222
[SPEAKER_10]: And like you said kind of after a year where a couple years now where things are just so out of whack it did feel really normal to see a gym full of people there so it was great.

368
00:41:22,224 --> 00:41:23,865
[SPEAKER_10]: things could have gone wrong, but they didn't.

369
00:41:23,925 --> 00:41:27,869
[SPEAKER_10]: And we had a really good first year, first season, because we'll be back in the spring.

370
00:41:28,449 --> 00:41:38,297
[SPEAKER_10]: But what I was going to add is that I, you know, I can get more into the Common Ground program, actually physically get in there and just see, you know, what the ideas are going forward.

371
00:41:39,298 --> 00:41:45,183
[SPEAKER_10]: And between the actual classroom and touch base with Paul DeLeva a little bit and what we're looking in terms of

372
00:41:46,164 --> 00:41:57,454
[SPEAKER_10]: I know we talked a little bit about it being an actual elective, but there would be a whole process that, you know, we'd be involved with in creating a syllabus and proposing that and making it accredited course.

373
00:41:57,515 --> 00:42:00,938
[SPEAKER_10]: So those are just some ideas that I think we had last year.

374
00:42:00,998 --> 00:42:03,040
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, Tanya, we discussed that a little bit.

375
00:42:03,821 --> 00:42:09,826
[SPEAKER_10]: And maybe making it independent of CCSR going forward and that diversity and enrichment elective.

376
00:42:10,887 --> 00:42:17,352
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's something that I can get more information on, see what's going on in there, and I can bring that to you all next time.

377
00:42:20,474 --> 00:42:20,855
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

378
00:42:20,895 --> 00:42:30,382
[SPEAKER_11]: And to be clear, again, it is research that's being provided, not anything that we're moving forward as a curriculum issue, but thank you, Carla.

379
00:42:30,402 --> 00:42:31,783
[SPEAKER_11]: I really appreciate that too.

380
00:42:32,463 --> 00:42:37,507
[SPEAKER_11]: And all that Mr. Skorka is doing toward that end and seeing the folks that are really committed to

381
00:42:39,105 --> 00:42:40,926
[SPEAKER_11]: not just inclusion, but meaningful inclusion.

382
00:42:41,006 --> 00:42:50,648
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think one of the ways that you see that happen naturally is in spaces like recreation, which is really why we're targeting that first, because you can see that, you know, the friends.

383
00:42:50,688 --> 00:43:00,870
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think Dr. Edward Vincent, you've been able to see firsthand with your nephew sort of involved, how it's been beneficial for our typical students.

384
00:43:02,466 --> 00:43:06,291
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, it was a win-win experience for everyone.

385
00:43:06,631 --> 00:43:07,772
[SPEAKER_12]: Everyone benefited.

386
00:43:07,792 --> 00:43:09,795
[SPEAKER_12]: It filled everyone's bucket.

387
00:43:10,155 --> 00:43:14,380
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think it was a great experience for all of the students.

388
00:43:15,201 --> 00:43:22,390
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's something that I do look forward to continuing to support and see how we can

389
00:43:23,290 --> 00:43:31,796
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, gather more momentum and have more students who maybe didn't really know what it was going to be like, but now they've had an opportunity to see it.

390
00:43:32,096 --> 00:43:42,402
[SPEAKER_12]: And so, you know, maybe there'll have to be a waiting list and kids will have to try out to be able to be part of unified sports.

391
00:43:42,522 --> 00:43:46,505
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's something that they're like, I want to get on that team.

392
00:43:47,185 --> 00:43:51,088
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, we can think really big and see what happens next.

393
00:43:52,717 --> 00:43:54,258
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you and thank you for your support.

394
00:43:54,278 --> 00:43:54,558
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

395
00:43:54,578 --> 00:43:55,658
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice to see you, Ms.

[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for being here.

398
00:43:58,820 --> 00:43:59,000
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

399
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:00,561
[SPEAKER_11]: Pirates, did you have something you wanted to add?

400
00:44:01,201 --> 00:44:02,902
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, just saying, thank you, Carla.

401
00:44:02,922 --> 00:44:08,825
[SPEAKER_01]: But to see, because I'm one of the preschool teachers, and to see the kids now, I'm like, oh my God, my kids, you know?

402
00:44:09,285 --> 00:44:10,546
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's so nice to see.

403

405
00:44:19,270 --> 00:44:21,471
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, anyone else want to add anything?

406
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:26,361
[SPEAKER_11]: There's something, let me just see.

407
00:44:27,703 --> 00:44:35,349
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, then we'll get minutes out to folks and I would just, I guess we have a motion to adjourn.

408
00:44:38,071 --> 00:44:38,711
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to adjourn.
