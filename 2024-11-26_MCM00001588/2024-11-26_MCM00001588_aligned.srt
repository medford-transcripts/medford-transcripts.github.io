1
00:00:00,948 --> 00:00:02,309
And here we are.

2
00:00:02,409 --> 00:00:08,933
I'm going to call to order the meeting of Medford's Community Preservation Committee.

3
00:00:09,093 --> 00:00:12,475
It is Tuesday, October 22nd, 2024.

4
00:00:13,015 --> 00:00:14,696
Meeting is 6.30 p.m.

5
00:00:14,816 --> 00:00:17,938
to 8 p.m., and it's close enough to 6.30 p.m.

6
00:00:17,978 --> 00:00:18,379
right now.

7
00:00:21,781 --> 00:00:25,583
I will begin, as always, with a little bit of a preamble

8
00:00:26,573 --> 00:00:32,346
Um, to explain the process, do we have other participants in the meeting besides committee?

9
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:35,714
No, the other folks that are on there are Tim and Vicki, just to follow on.

10
00:00:35,974 --> 00:00:36,195
Okay.

11
00:00:37,121 --> 00:00:55,389
So, for those who have not been a part of this process before the way that that the community preservation committees application cycle works is that we will be having a series of presentations by applicants.

12
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:57,230
This is the 2nd or 2 meetings.

13
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:04,293
when we, this is our chance to gather all of the input on all of the applications for funding.

14
00:01:04,793 --> 00:01:16,478
And then beginning next month, the committee is going to start deliberating to make its decisions about what projects to recommend for funding and how much.

15
00:01:16,999 --> 00:01:25,102
So there won't be any deliberation this evening, but we look forward to hearing what all of the applicants have to share with us this evening.

16
00:01:27,367 --> 00:01:32,049
Anything else that we need to kick us off before we get going?

17
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:39,473
To members of the committee, I know that Teresa prepared helpful templates for us to take notes.

18
00:01:39,753 --> 00:01:51,899
So we'll be able to hopefully provide Teresa with some notes to keep on file so that we can remember how we arrived at the decisions this funding round.

19
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,520
So with that, do we have our first applicant here?

20
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:58,021
That is Kevin Bailey.

21
00:01:58,041 --> 00:02:01,383
Thank you for having me tonight.

22
00:02:01,423 --> 00:02:03,484
Our application that we're presenting today is to have

23
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:46,749
uh lights installed over at the common shell uh just to kind of give a brief overview of the common shell area um it is dcr property but it is um with an agreement to the city that the city is going to operate it um we actually have an agreement that just recently expired and we're working with dcr right now uh their proposal is just an automatic renewal for the next 10 years um the city of effort might want to make some changes to that contract

24
00:02:47,609 --> 00:02:53,391
But again, it looks good that DCR wants to just basically renew it for another 10 years.

25
00:02:54,411 --> 00:02:59,253
If you haven't been to the Con and Show, it is a great location.

26
00:02:59,313 --> 00:03:02,314
It's where the farmers market's located on Thursdays.

27
00:03:02,754 --> 00:03:11,737
We have city concerts, and we have a whole bunch of concerts that are put on there a lot from Method Art Collaborative that help support that.

28
00:03:12,497 --> 00:03:14,578
But it is a really great gathering location.

29
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:22,983
One thing that I hear routinely from people who are performing there is, especially at nighttime, we want to have night concerts.

30
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:30,208
Even after 8, 8.30 at night, concerts want to go until 9, 10 o'clock at night, and it becomes too dark.

31
00:03:30,748 --> 00:03:41,354
I am one that I can contest going to different concerts, and even with our movie nights at the end of the movie, it's always that challenge of what are we going to do with the lighting situation.

32
00:03:43,786 --> 00:03:47,448
The lights that are currently there, if you have seen it, it's no longer operational.

33
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:50,490
We have looked into trying to get those replaced or repaired.

34
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,751
It doesn't seem like that is actually feasible.

35
00:03:54,712 --> 00:03:58,994
So what I did do was reach out to a company called Musco.

36
00:03:59,575 --> 00:04:03,537
Musco is a field light company that you might be familiar with.

37
00:04:03,677 --> 00:04:07,579
All of our recent builds with field lights have actually been with Musco.

38
00:04:08,437 --> 00:04:14,542
Car Park, Gillis Park, behind the high school, Field of Dreams, those are all Musco Lighting Center.

39
00:04:15,724 --> 00:04:25,767
I think there's a reason why the city continuously does the biggest thing, and one of the reasons why I would like to propose this at the comment show is because it can be run through an app.

40
00:04:26,368 --> 00:04:39,252
And this is another issue that we run into a lot with operational with the rec department is it doesn't make feasible sense of having one of the four recreation staff members to be there for every concert and every event.

41
00:04:40,012 --> 00:04:41,853
But what we can do is turn on the lights

42
00:04:42,578 --> 00:04:48,026
right from our app or right from home, or we can program the lights to go on and off at a certain time.

43
00:04:48,787 --> 00:04:50,730
So that's one of the nice things that Musco Lights does.

44
00:04:51,337 --> 00:04:53,197
The second one is the spillover lighting.

45
00:04:53,297 --> 00:04:55,878
If you've been to, like, the Pickleball Pool, it's a car park.

46
00:04:56,358 --> 00:05:04,260
It's a perfect example where you can see that the lights are directly shining onto the Pickleball Pools, but it's not being shined into the residence.

47
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:19,884
And seeing that the condo shelves right across from the river, from the condos that are across the street have these types of lights, we'll really make sure that the lights are being concentrated on the field or on the stage, but not necessarily out to the existing area.

48
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:26,642
I believe you have all my proposal for the fees.

49
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:31,405
It would cost us about $98,000 to do a full install.

50
00:05:32,045 --> 00:05:44,131
And this is to get everything that we would like, including the request that the CPA came back with of asking for lighting between the walkway area of the field and over to the parking lot.

51
00:05:44,151 --> 00:05:45,731
So for everything, it'll be 98,000.

52
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:54,456
This also includes a full install of not using the existing poles that are in front of the conch shell.

53
00:05:54,476 --> 00:05:59,000
Even though the lights don't work, the original hope is that we can use those light poles.

54
00:05:59,581 --> 00:06:07,007
But after talking with different performers, one of their concerns is having, instead of a stage lighting, having a field light.

55
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:10,330
They're afraid of a bright light going into their eyes.

56
00:06:11,572 --> 00:06:20,817
did say that they can raise the pole a little bit higher, use a new pole so that it's shining more above them versus directly on them.

57
00:06:21,417 --> 00:06:30,061
And then there's also going to be a setting that I can dim the lights so if someone feels that it's too bright shining in the eyes, we can also dim the lights as well.

58
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:32,643
Thank you.

59
00:06:34,884 --> 00:06:36,645
Are there questions from committee members?

60
00:06:41,743 --> 00:06:43,705
Trying to find my mute button.

61
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:53,618
So, I'm just curious is the is the quote that you got is it similar to other similar projects that we had in the city.

62
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,240
Price-wise?

63
00:06:56,721 --> 00:06:57,701
Yeah, price-wise.

64
00:06:57,761 --> 00:06:58,701
Yeah.

65
00:06:59,442 --> 00:07:04,544
I don't have the full details, but I did have certain quotes for different fields.

66
00:07:05,364 --> 00:07:11,266
For example, if we were going to do Tufts Park, that quote was almost $250,000.

67
00:07:11,967 --> 00:07:15,348
That is to baseball fields, and that would be using existing labels.

68
00:07:16,368 --> 00:07:21,551
I also have another one at Hormel Stadium that was, I want to say it was $350,000, but again, a little bit more

69
00:07:26,485 --> 00:07:28,188
a lot more lighting that would have to be done.

70
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:32,573
They would be using the whole amount of light poles, but they would have to change all the light fixing.

71
00:07:33,193 --> 00:07:36,938
Obviously, a football stadium has more lights than what we're looking for.

72
00:07:38,681 --> 00:07:47,244
My other question is, have you done any, or were you planning to do any reach out to the surrounding community about the additional performance time?

73
00:07:47,264 --> 00:07:54,826
I know I've heard a couple of comments about, you know, if you put lights up, that means they'll play longer and it might be disturbing the piece.

74
00:07:54,846 --> 00:07:58,087
So, I don't know if you've done any reach out to the surrounding community.

75
00:07:59,453 --> 00:08:04,818
I have not reached out to them, but we don't allow music to go past nine o'clock at night.

76
00:08:05,799 --> 00:08:11,964
So I'm not planning on extending it to a longer period of time, 10, 11 o'clock at night.

77
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:25,957
But the second thing is right now, a lot of the concerts that we are having, the performers are actually coming in with their own set of lights that are not really adequate enough, but they are going past sunset and bringing their own spotlights.

78
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:34,329
Yeah, my concern was not so much the lights it was the noise, but yeah, I would, I would second that because actually I live in a neighborhood.

79
00:08:35,772 --> 00:08:41,534
I'm not bothered by the sound of music in the neighborhood, but I know that some people are concerned about it.

80
00:08:42,414 --> 00:08:45,155
And you can hear it all the way down to Whole Foods.

81
00:08:45,895 --> 00:08:51,657
So I wonder whether we are looking at the volume.

82
00:08:51,757 --> 00:09:02,680
So maybe it's not necessarily the schedule of when the music is playing, but whether we're considering the volume of the music, the amplification.

83
00:09:04,342 --> 00:09:10,185
if maybe that's something that we could look into to make sure that it doesn't become more of an issue.

84
00:09:10,685 --> 00:09:10,865
Yeah.

85
00:09:11,246 --> 00:09:17,809
And that's right on the application we do put in that it has to be at a reasonable level and that it is a neighborhood.

86
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:22,812
So that's kind of already put out there as the warning, but if there's... Because the sound travels up the river.

87
00:09:23,172 --> 00:09:27,654
And it kind of reflects off of the bridges and the riverbanks.

88
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:31,036
So there's kind of like a sound tunnel that projects it pretty far.

89
00:09:34,577 --> 00:09:35,358
Those are my questions.

90
00:09:35,618 --> 00:09:35,878
Thanks.

91
00:09:36,579 --> 00:09:37,559
Thank you for bringing that up.

92
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:37,940
Thanks.

93
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,281
Oh, and look at that cute baby.

94
00:09:40,442 --> 00:09:41,863
Does baby Foley have any questions?

95
00:09:46,006 --> 00:09:46,767
Just one quick question.

96
00:09:46,787 --> 00:09:51,231
Are there existing light poles coming down from this project, or are they just being left in place?

97
00:09:51,351 --> 00:09:51,591
Yes.

98
00:09:52,172 --> 00:09:54,333
They'll be taken down and they'll put new ones up.

99
00:09:55,074 --> 00:09:55,354
Thank you.

100
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:02,000
Great.

101
00:10:02,988 --> 00:10:04,688
Um, well, thank you.

102
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:05,789
Thank you very much.

103
00:10:05,949 --> 00:10:06,329
I guess.

104
00:10:06,669 --> 00:10:08,109
Thank you.

105
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:15,551
That was the affordable housing trust.

106
00:10:16,651 --> 00:10:18,651
Do we have anyone here from the affordable housing trust?

107
00:10:20,272 --> 00:10:21,012
Oh, I'm sorry.

108
00:10:21,032 --> 00:10:21,912
I'm just thinking our.

109
00:10:28,157 --> 00:10:29,798
We have our own affordable housing trust.

110
00:10:29,818 --> 00:10:34,440
When I think of affordable housing, I'm thinking of those people out there, not these people here.

111
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:37,782
So yeah, I would invite you both to come to the table as well.

112
00:10:37,822 --> 00:10:39,583
And we'll introduce everyone.

113
00:10:58,188 --> 00:10:58,668
Good evening.

114
00:10:59,589 --> 00:11:01,931
Thank you, CPC, for this opportunity.

115
00:11:02,011 --> 00:11:06,414
And thank you, Teresa, for guiding the trust with the application process.

116
00:11:07,415 --> 00:11:12,018
I'm Aditi Mughal, staff planner for housing with the city's planning department.

117
00:11:12,118 --> 00:11:14,980
I'm here on behalf of the Medford Affordable Housing Trust.

118
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:21,925
Along with me, board of trustees here present are Lisa Ann Davidson, who's the chair.

119
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:31,452
Penelope or Penny Taylor, the Vice Chair, and we have five other Board of Trustees and Governor Campbell, who needs no introduction.

120
00:11:32,754 --> 00:11:35,498
And the rest of them are not in here today.

121
00:11:38,213 --> 00:11:42,115
A quick overview of the Affordable Housing Trust.

122
00:11:42,215 --> 00:11:48,578
It's a fairly newly established entity, and the Board of Trustees were appointed in July.

123
00:11:48,918 --> 00:11:56,382
Since then, we've had three public meetings, and by end of the year, we hope to have the declaration of trust ready.

124
00:11:56,983 --> 00:12:03,566
This would allow the trust to purchase, sell, or transfer real property, and by end of May next year,

125
00:12:05,156 --> 00:12:13,142
We hope to have a final action plan that would outline the trust goals and mission for the next five years.

126
00:12:15,504 --> 00:12:17,546
Currently, the trust has two working groups.

127
00:12:18,066 --> 00:12:20,228
One is working on the declaration of trust.

128
00:12:20,888 --> 00:12:24,812
The legal counsel is reviewing a draft of the declaration of trust.

129
00:12:24,992 --> 00:12:28,615
And as mentioned earlier, we hope to have that completed by end of the year.

130
00:12:29,335 --> 00:12:32,398
The second working group is the action plan group.

131
00:12:32,945 --> 00:12:40,146
And this working group is organizing focus group discussions to receive inputs from stakeholders.

132
00:12:40,707 --> 00:12:46,608
And then the group is also reviewing housing data that would inform the action plan.

133
00:12:47,288 --> 00:12:51,249
Early next year, the trust plans to have two community meetings.

134
00:12:51,549 --> 00:12:58,750
And then by end of May, the trust plans to have a final action plan, which will be presented to the city council.

135
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:04,963
There are a few potential projects that the trust is considering.

136
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:10,329
I'd like to clarify that these are project examples and the trust is open for discussion.

137
00:13:10,429 --> 00:13:15,415
Nothing is concrete and we are reviewing this project examples.

138
00:13:18,392 --> 00:13:22,074
The first one is to develop affordable housing on city-owned lots.

139
00:13:22,855 --> 00:13:27,478
This is a key strategy that was outlined in the city's housing production plan as well.

140
00:13:28,478 --> 00:13:39,745
The trust approach would be to identify potential municipal lots for housing and then do site feasibility pre-development work and then prepare RFPs to solve this for development.

141
00:13:40,706 --> 00:13:44,108
The trust would ideally take two different approaches.

142
00:13:44,728 --> 00:13:47,470
One approach would be to apply for

143
00:13:48,613 --> 00:13:56,815
Mass Housing's grant program, which would provide technical assistance to do site feasibility and pre-development work.

144
00:13:57,515 --> 00:14:02,916
This would require the trust to provide a local cash match of 10% value of the grant.

145
00:14:03,716 --> 00:14:08,097
So far, Mass Housing has provided grants ranging from $50,000 to $100,000.

146
00:14:12,737 --> 00:14:29,772
A second approach would be if the trust is not successful in receiving this grant, then the trust would require to use CPA funds to hire a consultant, do the site feasibility and redevelopment work, and prepare RFPs to solve the bids.

147
00:14:32,522 --> 00:14:38,407
Here are some of the potential city-owned lots that the Trust would like to consider.

148
00:14:39,247 --> 00:14:43,551
One is along Fulton Street lots, which is about 39,000 square feet.

149
00:14:44,251 --> 00:14:58,583
There's been some pre-development work or study done by graduate students, and a mission-driven developer has expressed interest to develop 100% affordable home ownership on the city-owned lot.

150
00:15:00,889 --> 00:15:04,070
The second one is along Riverside Ave.

151
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:08,751
It's a small city-owned lot, which is landlocked and inaccessible.

152
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:19,354
The pertaining property owner has expressed interest to acquire this lot and build housing development and provide 25% affordable housing units.

153
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:27,920
Another potential city-owned lots are along Bailey Street and Scott Street.

154
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:34,901
There's a private property between the two city-owned lots, which was on sale a couple of months ago.

155
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:42,783
So the property owner has expressed interest to sell this lot.

156
00:15:43,463 --> 00:15:50,004
So the trust could explore acquiring this property to form a contiguous city-owned lot to develop housing.

157
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:56,365
There are also smaller lots along Rand Street.

158
00:15:57,766 --> 00:16:05,353
These are very small lots, but could form a larger, contiguous lot.

159
00:16:06,334 --> 00:16:09,357
And this is something that Trust could explore acquiring as well.

160
00:16:09,377 --> 00:16:15,002
I'm sorry, it is under the city, but explore developing affordable housing.

161
00:16:17,997 --> 00:16:39,882
A second example would be for the trust to support construction of new affordable housing, potential projects, proposals from Medford Housing Authority or CDCs, Community Land Trust, Community Housing Development Organization, and comprehensive permit projects are something that the trust would support.

162
00:16:40,602 --> 00:16:47,504
Currently, City of Medford doesn't have a Community Land Trust, but the city is doing a feasibility study

163
00:16:48,504 --> 00:16:52,867
see if Medford could have a community land trust by end of the study.

164
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:56,709
We are hoping that community members would take initiative to establish one.

165
00:17:00,108 --> 00:17:05,270
Third example of a potential project would be to build a fund to purchase land when it becomes available.

166
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:10,492
As mentioned earlier, there are some private properties abutting city-owned lots.

167
00:17:10,652 --> 00:17:16,474
This could be a potential opportunity for the trust to acquire these slots and build affordable housing.

168
00:17:17,154 --> 00:17:21,296
Another opportunity would be to purchase existing affordable housing units.

169
00:17:24,715 --> 00:17:29,899
The fourth project example is to provide financial assistance to first-time home buyers.

170
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:35,263
This would support households whose income is at or below 100% AMI.

171
00:17:36,084 --> 00:17:44,610
Currently, the city does have a down payment assistance loan, which is funded through the North Suburban Consortium using home funds.

172
00:17:45,991 --> 00:17:52,576
This program provides financial assistance up to $10,000 for households whose income is at or below 80% AMI.

173
00:17:54,336 --> 00:17:58,978
it's a zero percent interest loan with a five-year default loan.

174
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:06,400
The consortium has set the purchase price limit of $606,000 for the property.

175
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:16,803
The trust could review the existing program and then see how a new Versailles home buyers program would supplement the existing one.

176
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:24,452
Lastly, this trust could provide rental assistance program.

177
00:18:25,232 --> 00:18:30,955
We understand that currently CPC is supporting few rental assistance programs.

178
00:18:31,455 --> 00:18:44,121
So the trust in the future could review these existing programs, identify opportunities and barriers, and then probably provide a new proposal that would strengthen the current programs.

179
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:55,715
Some of these rental assistance programs could include rental vouchers, moving costs, and assistance, remediation, referrals, and legal services.

180
00:18:59,714 --> 00:19:07,879
Currently, the trust doesn't have active funds, but the trust is looking at potential funding sources, CPA being the first one.

181
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:14,462
We're hoping that will apply for mass housing grant of roughly about $80,000 is what

182
00:19:16,335 --> 00:19:18,556
we would apply for.

183
00:19:18,836 --> 00:19:23,578
The trust is also anticipating a development payment of $250,000.

184
00:19:24,278 --> 00:19:31,421
A memorandum of understanding is in the process, and we hope that we'll receive these funds in a couple of months.

185
00:19:31,481 --> 00:19:40,084
The city has an inclusionary housing ordinance, but the ordinance does not have a cash-in-due or fractional payment at this point.

186
00:19:40,664 --> 00:19:45,266
We are hoping to update this ordinance, and this could be one of the income sources.

187
00:19:46,434 --> 00:19:47,055
for the trust.

188
00:19:48,236 --> 00:19:55,242
Lastly, the city does have a linkage program, but unfortunately, affordable housing linkage is not part of the program.

189
00:19:56,103 --> 00:20:07,633
The city and the trust is looking for funds to do a nexus study, which would enable the city to include affordable housing linkage, which could be a potential funding source for the trust.

190
00:20:10,777 --> 00:20:22,886
In terms of the CPA budget breakdown, as mentioned earlier, if we do receive the mass housing grant, then roughly about $8,000 of CPA funds would be used as a local cash match.

191
00:20:23,687 --> 00:20:30,572
And then the remaining $242,000 could be used for acquisition, construction, and support initiatives.

192
00:20:31,133 --> 00:20:35,396
If not, the trust would use roughly about $80,000

193
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:47,082
feasibility or pre-development work of CQN loss, and then the remaining $107,000 would be used for acquisition, construction and support.

194
00:20:47,683 --> 00:20:53,247
In total, the trust is requesting $250,000 from CPC.

195
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:57,370
Thank you.

196
00:20:57,651 --> 00:20:58,872
Thank you very much.

197
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:05,297
If the Board of Trustees have anything to add to the presentation, I'd like to welcome them.

198
00:21:06,405 --> 00:21:26,002
I would actually like to talk a little bit about how adding on to the down payment assistance program actually would maybe expand the pool of eligible participants receiving funds, because the income, as you know, CPC, you go up to 100% AMI.

199
00:21:26,062 --> 00:21:32,087
So it would be, I would like to see that.

200
00:21:32,147 --> 00:21:32,587
Great job.

201
00:21:36,735 --> 00:21:38,157
Questions from committee members?

202
00:21:43,324 --> 00:21:44,105
No questions.

203
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:47,510
This has been a long time coming, so thanks for your presentation.

204
00:21:51,093 --> 00:21:52,554
I guess I have a couple of questions.

205
00:21:53,014 --> 00:22:01,421
I know that this board, this committee has been very supportive of affordable housing since its inception.

206
00:22:01,521 --> 00:22:07,365
So I know that there's strong support in a broad sense for these type of initiatives.

207
00:22:07,405 --> 00:22:08,186
I agree with Joan.

208
00:22:08,306 --> 00:22:10,828
This has been in the works for years.

209
00:22:10,848 --> 00:22:11,448
We want to see it.

210
00:22:11,548 --> 00:22:16,873
I guess my concern, my question is, what's the best use of the $250,000?

211
00:22:16,973 --> 00:22:17,573
Because obviously,

212
00:22:20,215 --> 00:22:23,777
Construction-wise, that doesn't even get you, I don't think, even one unit.

213
00:22:24,778 --> 00:22:36,386
What's the best way to leverage the money, whether it's planning or analysis or assistance or closing costs to get the most people the most housing?

214
00:22:36,406 --> 00:22:44,691
That would be my general question because I don't feel like construction would be the best use, just broad general state of the statement.

215
00:22:46,952 --> 00:22:47,613
Great question.

216
00:22:48,516 --> 00:22:55,100
Um, and one that I thought of myself when I was thinking about asking like $250,000, there's not a lot of money.

217
00:22:55,161 --> 00:22:57,602
How are we going to best serve everybody there?

218
00:22:58,222 --> 00:22:58,723
It is.

219
00:23:00,004 --> 00:23:01,765
At least something to add.

220
00:23:01,825 --> 00:23:04,186
And I, at the currently you're right.

221
00:23:04,266 --> 00:23:12,612
Development might not be the right place, but it's the 250,000, these were just examples of what we could use, what we could use towards.

222
00:23:13,122 --> 00:23:27,708
I think when we're done doing the five-year planning, hopefully by mid-May, we'll have a better understanding of what the need is within the community so we could offer a better answer or a more direct answer.

223
00:23:29,829 --> 00:23:30,429
Thank you.

224
00:23:30,469 --> 00:23:31,650
Does that mean that we're kind of

225
00:23:33,352 --> 00:23:42,697
we're putting this down as an act of faith and you're gonna find, you're gonna do your analysis with this money, because we're not actually voting on any specific project.

226
00:23:42,837 --> 00:23:45,038
We're voting on an idea more than anything else.

227
00:23:45,098 --> 00:23:46,139
Isn't that correct?

228
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,100
Correct.

229
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,461
Correct right now.

230
00:23:49,621 --> 00:23:54,383
And there are, as Aditi was saying, there are costs there.

231
00:23:54,463 --> 00:24:00,747
We could enhance the assistance already being provided by other programs.

232
00:24:02,139 --> 00:24:27,236
The down payment assistance, I think that could be the best way, because if you're doing the 250 and you're trying to do it and you set something very similar up to what already exists, so you're not recreating the wheel, you're just taking what you already have, enhancing it a little bit, and it gives more people, people with slightly higher incomes, to an opportunity to purchase a home in here in Medford.

233
00:24:28,915 --> 00:24:36,080
The last question is, is the developer memorandum of understanding, is that public knowledge?

234
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:40,342
Is it about what project, what developer that is, or is that still kind of like in the works?

235
00:24:41,303 --> 00:24:43,744
It's still in the works, and it's not public knowledge yet.

236
00:24:44,225 --> 00:24:44,465
OK.

237
00:24:44,685 --> 00:24:50,969
And if we were to convey CTO logs, we would issue an RFP to allow different mission-driven developers to bid for it.

238
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:51,029
OK.

239
00:24:51,769 --> 00:24:52,610
Thank you.

240
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:55,372
If I might add kind of to both of those points,

241
00:24:56,592 --> 00:24:58,973
you kind of need some money to get more money.

242
00:24:59,053 --> 00:25:07,196
So kind of having that match in the bank to be able to apply for opportunities that require things like that, especially when we're just getting started is super important.

243
00:25:07,216 --> 00:25:08,677
So I would just add that piece as well.

244
00:25:09,297 --> 00:25:10,997
That's typically what we've been doing.

245
00:25:11,117 --> 00:25:18,600
We would give the first tranche of money to say the city is behind this project, whatever it is, and that allows you to go out and get more money.

246
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:21,101
So been there.

247
00:25:24,473 --> 00:25:28,196
I thought it was interesting, but I didn't remember about Ram Street.

248
00:25:28,256 --> 00:25:29,317
That was interesting.

249
00:25:29,877 --> 00:25:33,660
You got to kick the coyotes out if you go that route, but that's me.

250
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,642
I'd like to invite Kaylene here.

251
00:25:41,848 --> 00:25:43,069
Hi, thank you for your presentation.

252
00:25:43,089 --> 00:25:48,291
Yeah, not honestly, what Doug said, I'm just going to sort of reiterate.

253
00:25:48,771 --> 00:25:50,632
So I work for the Lexington Housing Authority.

254
00:25:50,652 --> 00:25:56,714
So I have the housing authority experience with AHTs and Lexington very newly just implemented there.

255
00:25:56,734 --> 00:25:58,795
So I think they're like the second funding cycle.

256
00:26:01,292 --> 00:26:19,062
They applied to their, to Lexington CPC for a similar sort of idea, like sort of like we're funding the pot here, but they do have other matching sources, you know, whether it's the fee, like, I'm gonna go up to the slide back up, but yeah, similar to Doug, you know, my concern is 250 is like pennies.

257
00:26:19,822 --> 00:26:21,563
in the grand scheme of things here.

258
00:26:21,623 --> 00:26:25,105
My concern is I have no problem, good faith, giving you the money.

259
00:26:25,245 --> 00:26:31,508
I would even say you could ask for more on the housing side of things because we don't have that many applications.

260
00:26:33,589 --> 00:26:36,871
You answered my question.

261
00:26:36,891 --> 00:26:40,473
If you have a five-year plan that you're still working through, that's great.

262
00:26:41,353 --> 00:26:46,916
I would just definitely pick the silo that I think you want to focus on.

263
00:26:49,055 --> 00:26:55,300
I don't know, that was really, yeah, my concern is just the 250 is not a lot of money here and that I think we should like think bigger.

264
00:26:55,320 --> 00:27:12,152
Housing trusts are like awesome opportunities for agencies, you know, I'm just thinking as a housing authority to off-cycle, you know, request funding, you know, whether it's for schematic, design, feasibility, whatever it is, you guys are there to support agencies like that.

265
00:27:12,232 --> 00:27:15,114
So if you have more money, I think that's even better, so.

266
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:22,123
I guess I don't really have a question anymore because Doug sort of asked them and you guys answered them.

267
00:27:22,163 --> 00:27:26,066
But yeah, just reiterating those concerns that he outlined, definitely.

268
00:27:29,308 --> 00:27:42,038
And I just wanted to take a moment to comment to acknowledge that I'm thrilled to be working with the talent that we've brought together for the affordable housing trust team.

269
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:44,760
Maybe each of you could just

270
00:27:45,313 --> 00:27:47,814
you know, give your background in a sentence or two.

271
00:27:48,234 --> 00:27:56,837
And you have a sample of our trust board, although we have great people who aren't able to be here with us this evening as well.

272
00:27:59,677 --> 00:28:00,438
Elevator pitch.

273
00:28:01,058 --> 00:28:04,439
My name is Lisa Day, at least to end and we can prefer Lisa.

274
00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:12,221
I have been working in the housing industry for a long time since before the turn of the century.

275
00:28:12,241 --> 00:28:14,762
I worked for the city of Somerville.

276
00:28:15,846 --> 00:28:20,289
I worked with the nonprofit communities and the in-house communities.

277
00:28:20,369 --> 00:28:26,813
I started by permanent supportive housing programs while I was at that nonprofit.

278
00:28:27,253 --> 00:28:32,696
And back at the City of Somerville, I sat on the City of Somerville's Affordable Housing Trust Fund.

279
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:38,540
I made commitments, looked at a development, asked for

280
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:46,222
funding opportunities through using CPA as well as using non-CPA funds.

281
00:28:50,857 --> 00:28:52,318
I'm Penny Taylor.

282
00:28:52,338 --> 00:29:00,385
For about the past 10 years, I've done community organizing around anti-displacement initiatives and strategic planning.

283
00:29:00,745 --> 00:29:12,054
And I have done rental assistance advocacy and running housing programs, anti-displacement programs and policy advocacy for the city of Somerville as well.

284
00:29:13,875 --> 00:29:21,082
And also just want to echo, we really have an amazing team, the people who can't be here tonight bring so much skills and knowledge to the team.

285
00:29:21,102 --> 00:29:27,628
We're all learning a lot from each other and it is really exciting to have this group together working on this project for the city.

286
00:29:27,648 --> 00:29:30,391
Thank you all.

287
00:29:32,045 --> 00:29:32,785
Thank you.

288
00:29:32,825 --> 00:29:36,167
You guys, you guys clearly know what you're doing and have the experience of that.

289
00:29:36,267 --> 00:29:37,127
And that's incredible.

290
00:29:37,147 --> 00:29:41,409
You know, so I just want to see this succeed and obviously money is the way to do that.

291
00:29:41,549 --> 00:29:45,151
So I think just go big or go home and your requests.

292
00:29:45,171 --> 00:29:47,352
So with that being said, yeah.

293
00:29:48,553 --> 00:29:49,293
Yeah, no problem.

294
00:29:49,313 --> 00:29:49,993
That's awesome.

295
00:29:50,013 --> 00:29:50,554
Thank you all.

296
00:29:50,594 --> 00:29:51,074
Wonderful.

297
00:29:51,094 --> 00:29:51,434
Thank you.

298
00:29:51,454 --> 00:29:52,174
Thank you so much.

299
00:30:08,023 --> 00:30:10,685
We'll wait a moment for a media switch.

300
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:13,547
Do we have someone here from agency B?

301
00:30:16,909 --> 00:30:17,829
Are you Ellie?

302
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:27,996
Oh, okay.

303
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:30,477
We've got a chance.

304
00:30:33,025 --> 00:30:34,646
Phone number, you can text her.

305
00:30:34,746 --> 00:30:37,848
All right, I can move on to the next thing and then come back to that.

306
00:30:37,968 --> 00:30:39,428
We will carry on our talks.

307
00:30:40,029 --> 00:30:40,529
Thank you.

308
00:30:40,569 --> 00:30:40,949
Thank you.

309
00:30:40,969 --> 00:30:41,369
Thank you.

310
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:21,993
So in the meantime, we have, are you Cindy?

311
00:31:23,033 --> 00:31:25,814
No, Cindy was going to be coming.

312
00:31:25,834 --> 00:31:26,114
Ruby.

313
00:31:26,214 --> 00:31:26,695
Okay.

314
00:31:26,795 --> 00:31:29,596
I thought that you, I've got an email saying that you couldn't come.

315
00:31:29,736 --> 00:31:32,797
So I was looking for you.

316
00:31:33,317 --> 00:31:33,977
Thank you.

317
00:31:34,037 --> 00:31:34,478
Good.

318
00:31:34,718 --> 00:31:34,878
Good.

319
00:31:34,918 --> 00:31:37,419
And you were here for the housing presentation.

320
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:38,239
So good.

321
00:31:38,339 --> 00:31:38,479
Good.

322
00:31:39,177 --> 00:31:40,557
Thank you for joining us.

323
00:31:41,557 --> 00:31:42,238
Um, all right.

324
00:31:42,298 --> 00:31:47,739
Do we have Cindy from, so I did have, I had told her about seven because she had a commitment.

325
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:50,659
So maybe we could go to Tim.

326
00:31:50,719 --> 00:31:51,059
Yes.

327
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:54,080
I'm sure.

328
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,000
Would you mind going?

329
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:55,940
No, that's fine.

330
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:56,140
Yeah.

331
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,621
What did you guys want to do?

332
00:32:00,141 --> 00:32:00,801
Thank you very much.

333
00:32:01,381 --> 00:32:06,282
I think most of you know me, Tim McGibbon, the DBW commissioner.

334
00:32:07,197 --> 00:32:08,538
And thank you for the opportunity tonight.

335
00:32:08,578 --> 00:32:10,359
I'm here to talk to you about two projects.

336
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:19,405
If it doesn't order the agenda, I think Playset Park Tennis Courts Reservicing is first, excuse me, and then the Cemetery Buildings Preservation Design Project.

337
00:32:21,246 --> 00:32:23,807
So we'll start with the Playset Park Tennis Courts Reservicing.

338
00:32:23,827 --> 00:32:25,388
Can I share my screen?

339
00:32:25,448 --> 00:32:26,729
I just want to do some pictures real quick.

340
00:32:26,749 --> 00:32:32,673
I should be able to share.

341
00:32:35,034 --> 00:32:35,315
Okay.

342
00:32:37,607 --> 00:32:39,108
I'm going to pick the right window.

343
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:43,910
Welcome.

344
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:44,890
Thank you for joining us.

345
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:51,273
We just took things out of order because we had a lot of fun time.

346
00:32:51,313 --> 00:32:54,635
So we'll get to your application in a few minutes.

347
00:32:55,315 --> 00:32:55,655
Thank you.

348
00:32:55,675 --> 00:32:57,376
Is that the one that was specifically for me?

349
00:32:57,476 --> 00:32:57,836
Yes.

350
00:32:58,036 --> 00:32:58,417
You can go.

351
00:32:58,497 --> 00:32:59,157
You wanted to start.

352
00:33:00,272 --> 00:33:03,414
Um, if you want to take a moment, uh, yeah, if you don't mind.

353
00:33:03,434 --> 00:33:03,514
Yeah.

354
00:33:03,714 --> 00:33:07,976
Why don't we switch back to the, to the order of the agenda?

355
00:33:08,216 --> 00:33:09,496
And so have St.

356
00:33:09,536 --> 00:33:12,538
Francis, um, just started.

357
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:13,498
So you guys are late.

358
00:33:13,578 --> 00:33:14,378
I'm sorry to be here.

359
00:33:14,538 --> 00:33:14,779
All right.

360
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:15,299
Nice to meet you all.

361
00:33:27,231 --> 00:33:30,093
We do have committee members joining us remotely.

362
00:33:31,053 --> 00:33:32,074
We are fully hybrid.

363
00:33:32,194 --> 00:33:32,574
Great.

364
00:33:34,876 --> 00:33:38,778
So if you will introduce yourselves and introduce the project.

365
00:33:39,419 --> 00:33:39,659
Sure.

366
00:33:40,179 --> 00:33:40,579
Okay.

367
00:33:40,739 --> 00:33:43,361
Cindy Watson, first generations in a franchise.

368
00:33:44,141 --> 00:33:45,222
That's the New York Queen of Peace.

369
00:33:45,262 --> 00:33:46,943
We combined with two parishes.

370
00:33:46,963 --> 00:33:49,905
Oh, this time we're applying for money for St.

371
00:33:50,505 --> 00:33:50,986
Chris.

372
00:33:51,046 --> 00:33:51,246
Okay.

373
00:33:51,686 --> 00:33:52,827
I'm Reverend Timothy Hines.

374
00:33:53,187 --> 00:33:54,428
I'm the pastor of Mary Queen of Peace.

375
00:33:57,623 --> 00:33:58,003
of St.

376
00:33:58,043 --> 00:33:58,683
Joseph's below.

377
00:33:59,904 --> 00:34:00,284
Thank you.

378
00:34:00,304 --> 00:34:11,947
Okay, I just want to preface this by saying she has been a tremendous help since I'm a novice at this, has taken the lead, I've been a recipient with other folks at the Chevalier, things like that.

379
00:34:13,347 --> 00:34:17,088
Anyway, we did a lot of work and research.

380
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:20,229
We have many, many windows over at St.

381
00:34:20,269 --> 00:34:20,749
Francis.

382
00:34:21,249 --> 00:34:22,730
They're in dire need of repair.

383
00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:24,830
So we're asking for $150,000 for window restoration.

384
00:34:28,446 --> 00:34:30,447
When it rains, it leaks through the windows.

385
00:34:30,467 --> 00:34:34,169
We have a big formation room downstairs that gets soaked.

386
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:39,972
The more climate weather we have, we're at high risk for electrical fires.

387
00:34:40,652 --> 00:34:44,094
The outside of the windows are all boarded up with blue tape.

388
00:34:44,815 --> 00:34:47,216
Some of them are not able to be even opened.

389
00:34:49,177 --> 00:34:50,618
So that's kind of a brief synopsis.

390
00:34:50,978 --> 00:34:52,459
We've been around for like 103 years.

391
00:34:52,979 --> 00:34:54,980
And the parishioners of St.

392
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,821
Francis are very involved.

393
00:34:57,595 --> 00:35:01,837
Obviously, she was a force of strength and a beacon of hope.

394
00:35:02,718 --> 00:35:08,601
So, we put the heat on this winter, and like everybody, it's literally going out the window.

395
00:35:11,743 --> 00:35:12,443
Thank you.

396
00:35:12,463 --> 00:35:16,666
Are there any other questions?

397
00:35:19,658 --> 00:35:21,320
I have a question.

398
00:35:22,141 --> 00:35:22,641
Oh, sorry.

399
00:35:22,661 --> 00:35:31,730
I was reading the quote that you got from Burnham and I'm confused.

400
00:35:31,891 --> 00:35:39,078
Is this replacing the windows and the framing or is it just the framing or what is this for?

401
00:35:42,871 --> 00:35:46,535
So 47 new bronze aluminum double glazed window frames.

402
00:35:47,116 --> 00:35:50,499
Is that not the window or is that just a frame or what is it?

403
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:54,563
It's the frames to the 300 series double glazed window frames.

404
00:35:54,583 --> 00:35:54,903
Yeah, so.

405
00:35:57,941 --> 00:36:01,485
The windows themselves are not intended to be replaced because they're stained glass windows.

406
00:36:01,665 --> 00:36:05,729
So the idea is that they will be removed and that new frames will be put in.

407
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:09,374
So part of the problem is that the frames themselves are at issue.

408
00:36:09,434 --> 00:36:11,856
They're warped or they're old, right?

409
00:36:12,557 --> 00:36:15,159
They're no longer the same size they were when they were put in 100 years ago.

410
00:36:16,139 --> 00:36:20,983
And then secondarily, a double pane of glass would be added as well.

411
00:36:21,063 --> 00:36:26,026
So right now it's just the stained glass window, which doesn't provide obviously really any insulation.

412
00:36:26,586 --> 00:36:32,010
So the thought would be the panes themselves, the stained glass windows would be removed along with their frames.

413
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:34,472
New frames would be placed in, stained glass windows,

414
00:36:35,978 --> 00:36:39,719
I forget if the double pane window goes first, I think the double pane window goes second.

415
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:46,081
So I think the stained glass windows go in and then the double pane window goes on the outside and protect the stained glass from the elements.

416
00:36:47,841 --> 00:36:53,563
That is very helpful to explain all of this context.

417
00:36:53,643 --> 00:37:02,025
It's really actually helpful when there are photos accompanying the application so that we can get a visual of what we're talking about.

418
00:37:02,838 --> 00:37:07,860
I've got several pictures on my phone that somehow we can get and submit them.

419
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:14,322
Yeah, that would be helpful if you can submit some pictures that we can have when we have our deliberation.

420
00:37:14,342 --> 00:37:22,706
I would also like just to share that Cindy has been doing incredible work with trying to get multiple quotes from vendors.

421
00:37:22,926 --> 00:37:31,309
And I don't know if it's just the season for historic window restoration, but she was having a difficult time trying to get responses back.

422
00:37:32,211 --> 00:37:38,114
So luckily, Burnham and LaRoche being a local vendor here just up the street, you can always walk down to the job site, not that they would.

423
00:37:38,914 --> 00:37:45,757
But just to add that they're trying to put together a more robust estimate there.

424
00:37:47,097 --> 00:37:50,098
But just wanted to share that story there.

425
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:57,842
I sent you a list of four or five vendors and they didn't get back to you.

426
00:37:57,862 --> 00:37:59,422
They told you that they're not available.

427
00:37:59,462 --> 00:38:01,323
So just to provide that clarity.

428
00:38:02,128 --> 00:38:11,111
So if you do get any more information, pass it along and we'll add that to our packet when we deliver it.

429
00:38:12,532 --> 00:38:13,352
More questions?

430
00:38:15,813 --> 00:38:16,373
Hayley?

431
00:38:16,453 --> 00:38:22,636
Does the Archdiocese have any responsibility here in helping you foot the bill or like what's their role here?

432
00:38:23,396 --> 00:38:26,897
No, I would love it if the Archdiocese would assist us in that way.

433
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:29,578
Generally speaking, we pay the Archdiocese.

434
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:43,045
We are, every parish in the Archdiocese of Boston is, I like to call it a tribute, but they will call it a tax or a some other term.

435
00:38:43,745 --> 00:38:47,167
Anyway, we have to contribute to the central ministries, right?

436
00:38:47,187 --> 00:38:52,389
So there's no giant parish in the middle of the Archdiocese that gets income from offertory.

437
00:38:52,869 --> 00:38:54,270
Our offertory helps pay for that.

438
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:59,793
So generally speaking, these are certainly building repairs and things like that would not be something that the Archdiocese would assist with.

439
00:39:01,106 --> 00:39:07,950
They might assist in terms of offering us a good rate on a loan, but they don't offer funds, unfortunately.

440
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:18,116
So, if they are on record as the owner of the building, do they need to be a signatory on contracts?

441
00:39:18,216 --> 00:39:20,478
I have power of attorney over all of them.

442
00:39:20,738 --> 00:39:21,058
Okay.

443
00:39:21,318 --> 00:39:27,842
I think Haley froze, but I hope she can still hear us and I answered her question.

444
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,341
She's very still.

445
00:39:32,981 --> 00:39:34,161
Questions, Doug?

446
00:39:34,802 --> 00:39:35,862
Yes.

447
00:39:38,043 --> 00:39:45,465
This is an odd one, I think, for me, because when I've seen window restoration projects, they've usually

448
00:39:46,638 --> 00:39:48,840
kept the windows or try to recreate the windows.

449
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:59,529
This is kind of a weird hybrid where we're building essentially a modern window outside of it, which I understand why, because of the fragility of the stained glass.

450
00:39:59,589 --> 00:40:01,611
But it's a different aesthetic.

451
00:40:01,631 --> 00:40:04,534
I guess I'm looking for more detail.

452
00:40:09,838 --> 00:40:20,691
I don't know if the contractor or maybe the preservation architect could do like a little section through a typical window, because if you're getting rid of the frame for the stained glass, because it's rotted metal,

453
00:40:21,637 --> 00:40:25,462
and it's single pane, what's holding the stained glass together?

454
00:40:25,482 --> 00:40:28,125
It's a fair question.

455
00:40:29,186 --> 00:40:39,959
I initially didn't understand where you're getting at, but it's a fair question because it's true when you're generally thinking about stained glass window, you're thinking about individual panes that form an image.

456
00:40:40,907 --> 00:40:43,910
And for the most part, that is what we have at the upper church.

457
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:47,053
The lower church is actually just stained glass.

458
00:40:47,213 --> 00:40:49,416
It's just stained glass panes for the most part.

459
00:40:49,436 --> 00:40:50,637
It's not figures.

460
00:40:51,137 --> 00:40:55,141
So really, it's just the frame that's holding in these stained glass themselves.

461
00:40:56,863 --> 00:40:59,826
I recently came from a parish in Norwood, and they had a number of their

462
00:41:01,403 --> 00:41:02,623
their stained glass windows repaired.

463
00:41:02,723 --> 00:41:09,826
Also, again, it takes forever for these companies to get back to people, and the project was delayed itself, I think, by about 18 months overall.

464
00:41:10,326 --> 00:41:16,648
But that was a project where they did actually have to remove the individual panes and then recreate the stained glass frames for that.

465
00:41:17,068 --> 00:41:18,489
It was very interesting what they ended up doing.

466
00:41:18,529 --> 00:41:23,771
In fact, at least this company would take pictures of these stained glass windows, and they created laminates.

467
00:41:24,011 --> 00:41:27,472
So when they removed the stained glass windows, they actually put temporary windows in.

468
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:31,461
because it was going to take 18 months, and they actually put these laminates on it.

469
00:41:31,501 --> 00:41:33,942
So it made it look like the windows still had the stained glass in them.

470
00:41:34,623 --> 00:41:45,109
The pastor, I was not the pastor of that parish, but he actually wishes that they hadn't done that, because from the perspective of many of the parishioners, because many of the windows weren't close up, many of the parishioners didn't even realize the windows had been removed.

471
00:41:45,589 --> 00:41:49,551
So there's many different processes that are involved, depending on what kind of stained glass.

472
00:41:49,851 --> 00:41:54,274
These ones are fairly simple, and they're really just colored glass in some respects.

473
00:41:56,287 --> 00:42:06,278
Um, I can't remember from my historical commission records if this building, um, is on the, is it on any state or national register?

474
00:42:06,378 --> 00:42:11,984
If anything, it hasn't been found significant by the Memphis historic commission, I don't believe, but I'm not sure.

475
00:42:16,083 --> 00:42:20,224
Doug, maybe while we're talking, could you do a quick search to see if it's on Macris?

476
00:42:21,044 --> 00:42:21,684
Yeah, I can do that.

477
00:42:21,704 --> 00:42:22,124
That's fine.

478
00:42:22,604 --> 00:42:26,425
I just, again, the- I think it's on Form B down here.

479
00:42:26,505 --> 00:42:28,426
Form B doesn't make it on Macris.

480
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:32,266
Yeah, I will do that because it's a weird hybrid.

481
00:42:32,286 --> 00:42:33,827
It's a new window, it's an existing window.

482
00:42:33,907 --> 00:42:42,909
I don't think it's what's recommended from the national standards for restoration for windows, just typically.

483
00:42:44,089 --> 00:42:44,649
But I don't want to

484
00:42:46,008 --> 00:42:53,155
I think we need photos, we need a little bit more detail to evaluate, because when I was doing the math, I'm like, okay, it's $3,000 a window.

485
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:53,875
That's a lot.

486
00:42:54,356 --> 00:42:57,919
But now that I see what's happening here, it kind of makes sense.

487
00:42:57,959 --> 00:43:03,283
There's a brand new window, there's a removal, there's a frame, but it's a big number per window.

488
00:43:04,224 --> 00:43:07,307
How big the windows are obviously factors into that as well.

489
00:43:08,641 --> 00:43:27,189
So that brings to mind perhaps something that our committee should consider the need for some technical support, if need be, because we have limited historic preservation capacity within the city.

490
00:43:27,249 --> 00:43:32,532
Maybe the Historical Commission would be able to provide the answer.

491
00:43:32,552 --> 00:43:33,212
I'm not sure.

492
00:43:33,752 --> 00:43:42,758
but we are required for CPA funds to meet the Secretary of Interior Standards for Historic Preservation.

493
00:43:43,618 --> 00:43:51,183
So we would need to make sure that the proposed treatment of these windows complies with that standard.

494
00:43:51,663 --> 00:43:53,384
There's someone in the waiting room.

495
00:43:54,005 --> 00:44:00,549
So what might be helpful for us would be to

496
00:44:03,468 --> 00:44:27,519
I don't know, like either the historical commission or we could hire an outside consultant to collaborate on a treatment plan together with your contractor so that everybody is, so that there's a consensus about what, to make sure that the treatment complies with the standards that were required.

497
00:44:28,437 --> 00:44:29,438
Sure, I agree.

498
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:29,818
I agree.

499
00:44:29,838 --> 00:44:31,639
That's what I'm that's what I'm getting towards.

500
00:44:31,719 --> 00:44:34,381
It's we just need a little more detail.

501
00:44:34,481 --> 00:44:43,408
I think the commission is probably a good idea to consult just to kind of kick the tires on this and do our due diligence on the building and make sure we understand what's going on.

502
00:44:43,448 --> 00:44:43,948
But you're right.

503
00:44:44,449 --> 00:44:45,930
The standards are the standards, but this is.

504
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:49,923
This is a treatment I actually haven't seen before.

505
00:44:50,923 --> 00:45:01,205
It's usually something that is either restored, because you're not restoring the windows, you're really replacing the windows with these things.

506
00:45:01,985 --> 00:45:10,227
The glass remains, the outer glass is really to protect the rest of it from the elements, from what I understand, but the company would be able to do it much better.

507
00:45:10,247 --> 00:45:16,848
This is what I've seen, certainly on the windows of the previous parish that I was at, their stained glass windows were also covered by an additional

508
00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:22,916
a pane of plain glass that I believe was also double-walled.

509
00:45:22,976 --> 00:45:24,838
It had a bend in it to prevent it from fogging.

510
00:45:24,858 --> 00:45:29,102
So I think that's the standard way to protect stained glass after it's been restored.

511
00:45:29,282 --> 00:45:30,784
Yeah, it's like adding storms.

512
00:45:30,984 --> 00:45:40,033
And that's a common thing that happens with historic windows, is to add storms to the outside to protect the historic windows.

513
00:45:41,055 --> 00:45:48,362
Yes, it's sometimes the outside and sometimes it's the inside depending on what the nature of the window is because the aesthetic.

514
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:58,696
It's not so critical here, but in a 19th century building or early 19th century, the profile of those mullions would be very different.

515
00:45:58,736 --> 00:46:02,559
If there was a full window in front of it with two panes of glass, it just wouldn't look the same.

516
00:46:03,199 --> 00:46:07,621
And I don't think that would pass muster for those national standards we're talking about.

517
00:46:08,642 --> 00:46:14,745
But I think the contractors that have done this before, they may have a detail off the shelf they can provide to us.

518
00:46:14,785 --> 00:46:17,007
So I think there's some opportunity here to kind of just

519
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:19,461
work through a few more details.

520
00:46:19,781 --> 00:46:22,202
Conceptually, it makes a lot of sense, this project.

521
00:46:22,702 --> 00:46:26,404
So I just want to try to get a path to success here.

522
00:46:27,804 --> 00:46:45,432
In my other community where I am the staff to the Community Preservation Committee, we have a procedure where all historic preservation projects are required to have what we call an advisory review.

523
00:46:45,975 --> 00:46:52,496
with the historical commission before the CPC makes its recommendation.

524
00:46:52,936 --> 00:47:01,598
And the purpose for that advisory review is exactly what we're talking about here, to make sure that whatever is being proposed is compliant with the standards.

525
00:47:02,038 --> 00:47:09,620
And then you can make sure that your budget fits the scope that we can approve.

526
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:13,001
So there might be a need to

527
00:47:14,711 --> 00:47:32,463
do a little bit more negotiation and research to make sure that we get to what the best figure is, the best scope and budget that the CPC can deliberate about.

528
00:47:33,363 --> 00:47:36,505
Am I showing the right windows?

529
00:47:36,886 --> 00:47:38,427
Is it these windows down here?

530
00:47:39,152 --> 00:47:40,573
The low, yes, the low ones.

531
00:47:41,294 --> 00:47:45,957
Not these windows, but the ones that are behind the rail.

532
00:47:47,138 --> 00:47:48,659
Exactly, that's correct.

533
00:47:48,959 --> 00:47:53,062
The ones that are the lowest set of those three sets of windows.

534
00:47:54,062 --> 00:47:55,764
And you prefer that as the lower church?

535
00:47:56,284 --> 00:47:57,065
That is so, yes.

536
00:47:57,165 --> 00:48:04,990
So it's not quite clear because you see three sets of windows, but the middle and then the upper church, it only has two floors.

537
00:48:06,725 --> 00:48:09,668
But yeah, all of those, those would all be the lower church windows.

538
00:48:10,008 --> 00:48:21,160
So one of the things unfortunately that ends up happening is that over the years, snow has been plowed into it and it creates additional so there would be, we want to make sure that that was not the problem going forward.

539
00:48:22,701 --> 00:48:27,947
And this contractor that we've had some inroads with, he's done

540
00:48:28,666 --> 00:48:31,107
approximately 25 years of work on this church.

541
00:48:31,647 --> 00:48:35,169
So he does know a little bit about the windows of the church.

542
00:48:35,269 --> 00:48:35,829
Yeah.

543
00:48:36,129 --> 00:48:36,729
In that respect.

544
00:48:36,990 --> 00:48:38,510
Yeah, that's that's helpful.

545
00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:41,872
And there was some contingency money built into the budget for 152.

546
00:48:42,172 --> 00:48:52,016
So to your point about going back to the historical commission, if they have some suggestions, we did have that budget to have contingency.

547
00:48:52,116 --> 00:48:53,697
I don't know if I missed it.

548
00:48:53,777 --> 00:48:56,958
I didn't see a like a budget summary.

549
00:48:57,558 --> 00:48:58,959
in the application?

550
00:48:58,979 --> 00:49:01,200
You're right.

551
00:49:01,641 --> 00:49:01,921
OK.

552
00:49:02,021 --> 00:49:02,261
Yes.

553
00:49:02,441 --> 00:49:07,645
So I had questions about the budget myself, which was, so I saw the estimate.

554
00:49:08,405 --> 00:49:12,868
And in the application, I read that you were doing a capital campaign.

555
00:49:13,609 --> 00:49:19,352
So I wanted to understand what is the scope of the capital campaign, and then

556
00:49:21,428 --> 00:49:25,252
How does that relate to the budget for this project?

557
00:49:25,932 --> 00:49:29,035
So what is each of those addressing?

558
00:49:29,942 --> 00:49:31,003
I can speak a little bit to that.

559
00:49:31,063 --> 00:49:33,285
I've, I've only been the pastor here at this parish for four months.

560
00:49:33,325 --> 00:49:36,608
So much of this, all pretty much all of this predates me.

561
00:49:37,249 --> 00:49:39,391
Uh, so my finance manager would be able to better speak to that.

562
00:49:39,411 --> 00:49:45,016
And my understanding is that I, uh, I think about five years ago, they ran five, three or five years ago.

563
00:49:45,036 --> 00:49:46,518
I forget exactly what the term was.

564
00:49:46,918 --> 00:49:47,779
We're nearing the end of it.

565
00:49:47,819 --> 00:49:52,003
This was the last year of our, what we called our increased hope, uh, capital campaign.

566
00:49:52,023 --> 00:49:52,323
Yeah.

567
00:49:52,363 --> 00:49:52,863
Inspiring.

568
00:49:52,924 --> 00:49:53,324
And so, um,

569
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:58,903
We haven't received, so there are a number of pledges that have come in for that.

570
00:49:58,923 --> 00:50:03,026
We haven't received all of the pledges made full quite yet.

571
00:50:03,447 --> 00:50:09,752
The thought was if we needed any additional funds to help assist with this project to reach completion, we would use some of those funds.

572
00:50:10,152 --> 00:50:13,055
So that's what that campaign was earmarked for.

573
00:50:13,075 --> 00:50:13,876
It was for capital.

574
00:50:14,256 --> 00:50:14,716
projects.

575
00:50:14,976 --> 00:50:19,078
And so were there other capital projects that the church has undertaken?

576
00:50:19,098 --> 00:50:25,060
So at least there was a roof that was repaired, that our parish center, I know that that was done.

577
00:50:25,921 --> 00:50:27,901
There were other things, but I can't speak.

578
00:50:27,961 --> 00:50:28,962
The boiler is part of it.

579
00:50:28,982 --> 00:50:29,362
Yeah, sure.

580
00:50:29,682 --> 00:50:31,603
The boiler in St.

581
00:50:31,623 --> 00:50:35,424
Francis, unfortunately, died not long ago.

582
00:50:35,444 --> 00:50:37,065
So we used some of the money for that as well.

583
00:50:39,046 --> 00:50:41,987
I can't speak to what the other monies might have been here much for, I just don't know.

584
00:50:42,367 --> 00:50:54,911
So what might be helpful is if you were to prepare the budget summary worksheet that we have and to show how much of that capital campaign money remains.

585
00:50:55,811 --> 00:51:05,534
Maybe what is the potential to raise capital funds from your own community to match the CPA grant?

586
00:51:06,334 --> 00:51:09,375
That would also be, I think, really helpful information for us.

587
00:51:12,769 --> 00:51:25,620
You know, Doug was wondering how you were getting to $3,000 per window, or yeah, how you were getting to that amount, to the $150,000 to repair all of these windows.

588
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:28,403
And I was wondering, why is it only $150,000 to repair?

589
00:51:29,544 --> 00:51:35,889
What you must have, like the capital needs must be just related to that alone.

590
00:51:37,261 --> 00:51:53,597
I'd like to have some context and understand how does this project relate to the whole project that you're trying to address and what resources you're plugging in just so that we know how our resources fit that picture.

591
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:58,161
Getting back to the historic mission, so you're suggesting that, what was it, John Hennison?

592
00:51:59,415 --> 00:52:01,236
So he's a historical society.

593
00:52:01,256 --> 00:52:04,017
We have like three different entities that are involved with history.

594
00:52:04,037 --> 00:52:11,601
So the historical commission would be Ryan Hayward, Jen Keenan, and I can happily facilitate conversations with them about that.

595
00:52:13,062 --> 00:52:14,182
I talk to Ryan daily.

596
00:52:14,582 --> 00:52:15,183
Okay, great.

597
00:52:15,403 --> 00:52:15,763
Thank you.

598
00:52:15,843 --> 00:52:16,363
Yeah.

599
00:52:17,203 --> 00:52:19,344
And also, we can work on that budget summary as well.

600
00:52:19,665 --> 00:52:20,025
Thank you.

601
00:52:20,125 --> 00:52:20,425
Of course.

602
00:52:25,827 --> 00:52:26,648
Other questions?

603
00:52:31,267 --> 00:52:31,567
All right.

604
00:52:32,768 --> 00:52:34,589
Well, thank you very much.

605
00:52:34,649 --> 00:52:35,889
It's been very helpful.

606
00:52:35,929 --> 00:52:36,910
Well, thank you.

607
00:52:37,270 --> 00:52:41,672
And with my hat on my sleeve, I just hide my soul in a month I can't control.

608
00:52:41,732 --> 00:52:43,393
We're going to get her out of here.

609
00:52:43,413 --> 00:52:44,474
That's a great tagline.

610
00:53:03,422 --> 00:53:04,442
I'll give you a call tomorrow.

611
00:53:04,602 --> 00:53:15,326
Thank you for your patience, Tim.

612
00:53:15,626 --> 00:53:20,827
Yeah, no problem.

613
00:53:21,427 --> 00:53:27,549
We had a anonymous person join that I didn't recognize, so I didn't want to have it open for everybody to be able to share.

614
00:53:27,569 --> 00:53:29,030
I hear you.

615
00:53:29,350 --> 00:53:30,430
But I trust you, so.

616
00:53:32,095 --> 00:53:33,576
There's still shenanigans happening.

617
00:53:33,596 --> 00:53:34,516
No Zoom bombs or anything.

618
00:53:34,557 --> 00:53:35,437
Well, hello again, everybody.

619
00:53:36,498 --> 00:53:37,258
Thank you for having me.

620
00:53:37,278 --> 00:53:39,899
All right, so we'll do Placeset first.

621
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:48,944
And this was... So this is a $526,000 request for the resurfacing of the Placeset Park tennis courts.

622
00:53:57,458 --> 00:54:06,604
And as far as the DPW asset management goes, we'll see the next one in line for resurfacing.

623
00:54:07,204 --> 00:54:14,929
Right now we're queuing up Tufts and Capon basketball courts, which CPC has funded.

624
00:54:15,690 --> 00:54:17,251
So those should be happening imminently.

625
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:19,012
And this is the next one in queue.

626
00:54:19,752 --> 00:54:26,657
The estimate is based off of recent bids, the ones that I just talked about, Tufts and Capon, and just discussions with

627
00:54:30,130 --> 00:54:33,212
So it's a larger, much larger court than the other ones.

628
00:54:33,793 --> 00:54:35,114
And I'll just run through some pictures.

629
00:54:35,434 --> 00:54:38,457
Just so you can understand.

630
00:54:40,139 --> 00:54:42,641
All right, this is the first one.

631
00:54:42,661 --> 00:54:47,585
I just have to move this screen out of the way so you can see the arrows.

632
00:54:48,306 --> 00:54:49,227
There's another one.

633
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:51,900
There's another one.

634
00:54:51,921 --> 00:54:58,206
So you can see how the cracks are at the point now where things are growing in between and the surface is starting to peel off.

635
00:54:58,726 --> 00:55:00,367
That acrylic surface is starting to peel.

636
00:55:01,388 --> 00:55:05,391
This is one of the newer cracks that I noticed actually has gotten wider recently.

637
00:55:05,411 --> 00:55:11,196
This is part of that same crack system.

638
00:55:11,216 --> 00:55:13,238
So as you can see, it needs to be

639
00:55:16,687 --> 00:55:17,947
resurfaced.

640
00:55:17,967 --> 00:55:25,008
So pretty straightforward, very similar project to similar ones that we've done with this board previous years.

641
00:55:25,048 --> 00:55:33,390
Are there questions from committee members?

642
00:55:33,410 --> 00:55:34,810
Can't see anyone.

643
00:55:35,410 --> 00:55:35,990
No, we have not.

644
00:55:36,671 --> 00:55:40,231
But this is an estimate based off of the basically last three bids that we got.

645
00:55:41,231 --> 00:55:44,832
Yeah, we wouldn't put it up to bid until, you know, the end of Monday.

646
00:55:46,007 --> 00:55:47,228
but knew what the funding path was.

647
00:55:52,590 --> 00:55:56,131
So how does this surface compare to the other ones?

648
00:55:56,211 --> 00:55:58,572
Is this in better shape, worse shape, same shape?

649
00:55:58,592 --> 00:56:01,733
Compared to the other ones that we've resurfaced?

650
00:56:02,694 --> 00:56:02,954
Yeah.

651
00:56:03,034 --> 00:56:08,096
I mean, those cracks, which I wonder, can they be repaired versus redoing the whole thing?

652
00:56:08,116 --> 00:56:12,718
The rest of the port looks okay, but I can't tell from pictures, yeah.

653
00:56:13,457 --> 00:56:25,967
Yeah, so the problem with repairing surfaces like this is you can see on some of those deeper cracks, the cracks actually go all the way down to the base of the pavement.

654
00:56:26,707 --> 00:56:35,894
So at Hickey Park, what was it, Barry, I'm sorry, Barry Park, there was a project that just did a skim resurfacing and a crack repair.

655
00:56:36,475 --> 00:56:40,578
And within a year and a half, I think, that started opening up again.

656
00:56:41,143 --> 00:56:51,669
And now if you go out there, um, I've actually put it back on the list for a capital project because it needs to be, um, rebuilt from the base up basically, or the cracks has come through the next year.

657
00:56:52,269 --> 00:56:57,812
So it's, um, really a good, not a good use of money to do that.

658
00:56:58,373 --> 00:57:05,757
Um, what you could do is seal the cracks for a very short amount of time, you know, between a year or two before they'll start opening up again.

659
00:57:06,257 --> 00:57:07,878
But we should plan to, um,

660
00:57:08,545 --> 00:57:15,288
do this to every court when it begins to show cracking like that, deep cracks that go all the way to the base, basically.

661
00:57:19,350 --> 00:57:21,051
Thanks.

662
00:57:24,152 --> 00:57:27,753
How long do the courts typically last before they get to that condition?

663
00:57:27,773 --> 00:57:30,155
Can that be prolonged?

664
00:57:32,254 --> 00:57:32,955
It's a good question.

665
00:57:33,055 --> 00:57:34,237
So they're just made of asphalt.

666
00:57:34,357 --> 00:57:39,465
Asphalt, if it's placed properly to spec, you should get 30 years out of it.

667
00:57:40,747 --> 00:57:45,815
The coating on the top should make it last a little bit longer and it's not vehicular loaded.

668
00:57:50,533 --> 00:57:54,134
But it all depends on the quality of the workmanship when you're down, really.

669
00:57:54,994 --> 00:58:03,257
We've had roads that are paved and start unraveling, they call it, or deteriorating within five years because they got the spec wrong on the mix.

670
00:58:04,917 --> 00:58:09,079
But then we've had roads that 40 years later, they still look fine.

671
00:58:10,019 --> 00:58:17,721
So it's kind of hard to give you an exact number, but we plan 20 to 30-year zone, usually for asphalt pavements around there.

672
00:58:18,381 --> 00:58:19,982
So I don't know in places it was built.

673
00:58:20,896 --> 00:58:21,677
That's the next question.

674
00:58:23,158 --> 00:58:26,800
I just know that those those types of facts, basically, it's like they don't get smaller.

675
00:58:27,961 --> 00:58:30,643
So I think within the next couple of years, we should probably replace that.

676
00:58:30,663 --> 00:58:31,223
Yeah.

677
00:58:31,343 --> 00:58:31,603
Yeah.

678
00:58:36,947 --> 00:58:40,489
I have a strange question, I'm sorry, I'm stealing it out to something.

679
00:58:41,130 --> 00:58:45,753
What kind of warranty or guarantee of work might come with this?

680
00:58:46,730 --> 00:58:50,771
I think it's safe to say that some of our courts out there were not put down correctly.

681
00:58:50,791 --> 00:58:54,993
And it's a shame that we can't go back to those vendors for work.

682
00:58:55,053 --> 00:58:58,874
I just don't know what type of warranty there is.

683
00:58:59,134 --> 00:59:00,094
It's typically a year.

684
00:59:00,214 --> 00:59:05,336
And if we buy a product, then it's whatever the warranty of the product is, like a basketball hoop or something like that.

685
00:59:06,316 --> 00:59:11,198
But for the actual asphalt work and the treatment, it's one year.

686
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:13,801
And that's tough to get around.

687
00:59:13,821 --> 00:59:26,852
So basically, to prevent or to not prevent, but to minimize risk, you do things like inspect the base, inspect the compaction, test the temperature of the mixture when putting it down.

688
00:59:26,872 --> 00:59:31,696
So there's things that you can do to mitigate that risk of the long-term failure issues.

689
00:59:32,556 --> 00:59:32,917
Very well.

690
00:59:33,157 --> 00:59:33,517
Thank you.

691
00:59:34,798 --> 00:59:35,219
Thank you.

692
00:59:35,339 --> 00:59:35,519
Ari?

693
00:59:36,727 --> 00:59:41,789
This might be a controversial question, but I know there's been a high demand for pickleball courts.

694
00:59:41,889 --> 00:59:47,511
Is there any consideration of dual lining it for multi-use?

695
00:59:49,311 --> 00:59:50,392
Yes, as always.

696
00:59:50,712 --> 00:59:58,815
So I think when it comes time to make the decision for the final striping, we can request X number of pickleball courts.

697
01:00:02,316 --> 01:00:03,877
put some striking down there, for example.

698
01:00:04,398 --> 01:00:10,524
So this at this point in time, knowing the popularity of that sport, I would say we would plan on doing that.

699
01:00:10,544 --> 01:00:14,988
Thank you.

700
01:00:15,648 --> 01:00:18,311
As a retrofit, sorry, not as dedicated to the ball courts.

701
01:00:18,811 --> 01:00:20,833
Yeah, exactly.

702
01:00:20,853 --> 01:00:21,554
Like a thugger.

703
01:00:22,234 --> 01:00:23,255
Yeah, tennis courts.

704
01:00:23,756 --> 01:00:24,937
You could also use a ball.

705
01:00:28,533 --> 01:00:37,417
I just had to comment that I know there's been a lot of talk lately about the need for skate parks in Medford.

706
01:00:37,617 --> 01:00:56,385
And I work in Somerville, one of the parks that I stopped at recently, I caught a picture, I was just five minutes too late to catch them actively playing pickleball with a skateboarder using the skate, like the benches that were made for skateboarders.

707
01:00:56,957 --> 01:00:57,658
around them.

708
01:00:57,678 --> 01:01:03,968
So sharing pickleball and skateboarding in the same fort, it could be done.

709
01:01:04,008 --> 01:01:04,889
That's pretty interesting.

710
01:01:05,230 --> 01:01:09,457
There's a young gentleman who's very interested in building a skate park in Medford in Basin Park.

711
01:01:09,477 --> 01:01:10,879
So I've been helping him out.

712
01:01:12,530 --> 01:01:31,301
I would love to see just incorporating more skate-friendly amenities in any parks anywhere, because there's no reason why we have to segregate all of the people who like to use skateboards over in one part of the city.

713
01:01:31,321 --> 01:01:34,122
We can accommodate them anywhere.

714
01:01:34,923 --> 01:01:36,224
So just a plug for that.

715
01:01:37,524 --> 01:01:38,405
I had one more question.

716
01:01:38,505 --> 01:01:40,426
Oh, the basis for prioritizing playstead.

717
01:01:42,672 --> 01:01:44,373
ahead of any other parks?

718
01:01:44,413 --> 01:01:48,096
Like what else is needed in the city in terms of courts?

719
01:01:48,156 --> 01:01:49,937
And how did we arrive at this one this year?

720
01:01:50,318 --> 01:02:01,786
Well, we arrived at this one this year because we feel that it's the one that is deteriorating the most and at a rate that we have been affecting the play, that we need to do something about that.

721
01:02:01,846 --> 01:02:09,051
And I would say even Barry, because the Barry improvements are peeling off and that's the permanent effects.

722
01:02:11,317 --> 01:02:13,077
And there are other ones for sure.

723
01:02:13,698 --> 01:02:17,378
But these are the ones that we feel are the ones that need to be addressed sooner rather than later.

724
01:02:17,398 --> 01:02:22,620
And we try to do one court or field improvement every year.

725
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:28,721
Actually, we ended up doing a little bit of work on the varsity baseball field this past year.

726
01:02:28,761 --> 01:02:32,222
But in general, that's what I want to do, try to do one year.

727
01:02:34,086 --> 01:02:38,116
Is there any analysis of like, which courts get more play around the city?

728
01:02:38,517 --> 01:02:41,103
I think I feel like I always hear of

729
01:02:41,590 --> 01:02:42,851
things happening at Placestead?

730
01:02:42,911 --> 01:02:44,731
So I'm like, is this our most popular court?

731
01:02:44,892 --> 01:02:45,992
Or do we even know?

732
01:02:46,352 --> 01:02:52,475
Yeah, I mean, I probably have, from my observations, I'm sure Reggie has some of his observations as far as permits and things like that.

733
01:02:52,495 --> 01:02:58,077
As far as non-programmatic, just public general use, Placestead is one of our more popular parks.

734
01:02:58,298 --> 01:03:01,719
So the Placestead courts, if you go on a weekend, they're basically filled out.

735
01:03:01,999 --> 01:03:04,500
Sometimes there's people waiting in line for tennis at those courts.

736
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:07,102
I don't know, Reggie, if you've seen that too.

737
01:03:07,642 --> 01:03:10,203
One of the things is USTA has a specific

738
01:03:15,206 --> 01:03:17,607
their tennis lessons.

739
01:03:18,447 --> 01:03:18,887
Okay.

740
01:03:18,987 --> 01:03:24,230
And so I'm sure that last year we had a young citizen

741
01:03:25,396 --> 01:03:49,565
come by and say that she was very disappointed in the amount of time that she had to wait to get on the court because the USTA had a permit from like 9 to 12 or something like that and that was the only time that she could really get on it was on the weekends and so I know the place that gets a lot of usage primarily because they have free courts yeah um and and um you know most of the courts that we have around the city are

742
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:51,201
Maximum two courts.

743
01:03:51,801 --> 01:03:52,302
Yeah, okay.

744
01:03:52,362 --> 01:03:59,787
And so, you know, you can go to place that you carry you Barry Yeah, the berries like you said kind of beat up.

745
01:04:00,007 --> 01:04:00,788
It's a little bit beat up.

746
01:04:00,848 --> 01:04:07,933
It doesn't get nearly as much use soon But you know, so we have a pretty good idea who's playing where?

747
01:04:08,273 --> 01:04:16,139
but quite quite frankly, I think placed it it's probably USTA still gonna utilize that and

748
01:04:17,787 --> 01:04:18,928
They've actually come to us.

749
01:04:19,008 --> 01:04:22,791
I don't know if you saw the minutes from our meeting or what have you.

750
01:04:23,531 --> 01:04:30,617
No, but they they've committed to put lights at the wrong tennis court.

751
01:04:30,657 --> 01:04:31,958
Oh, all right.

752
01:04:32,258 --> 01:04:38,223
Well, that was what the call was for.

753
01:04:38,303 --> 01:04:42,206
So, you know, it's something that we would probably

754
01:04:47,588 --> 01:04:52,851
So then give them two opportunities to have their tennis lessons, et cetera, et cetera.

755
01:04:52,931 --> 01:05:04,756
Because I think it's a little collaboration with the rec department and the city that we can probably work some good things out of it.

756
01:05:05,016 --> 01:05:05,917
Yeah, let's do it.

757
01:05:06,277 --> 01:05:06,417
Good.

758
01:05:07,899 --> 01:05:30,967
And I've been trying to talk to me if we could find an extra 10 or so thousand dollars in the city's budget somewhere could be really helpful to have like a. An athletic feel of utilization studies so that we knew what was like, or a park utilization study so that we knew what was going on where in all of our parks all the time and.

759
01:05:31,673 --> 01:05:35,295
Like, how much demand is there for all the activities?

760
01:05:35,315 --> 01:05:39,837
I mean, the Logan courts are like always empty once you're in the house.

761
01:05:39,857 --> 01:05:40,337
Sure, sure, sure.

762
01:05:40,357 --> 01:05:42,518
So I'm like, why doesn't Medford Rec do more programming?

763
01:05:42,558 --> 01:05:43,038
You know what I mean?

764
01:05:43,058 --> 01:05:50,282
Like, if ferry and plays are deteriorating, it feels like, yeah, it'd be really interesting to see where people are always playing.

765
01:05:50,482 --> 01:05:52,063
Yeah, we haven't done anything formal like that.

766
01:05:52,443 --> 01:05:55,724
I'm sure that something like that would be incredibly informative.

767
01:05:55,885 --> 01:05:57,125
I mean, it would help me too, I think.

768
01:05:57,325 --> 01:05:58,766
Like I said, Logan, I met Morrison.

769
01:06:00,192 --> 01:06:01,333
Morrison, yeah, yep.

770
01:06:01,513 --> 01:06:03,094
Morrison doesn't see a lot of action.

771
01:06:03,114 --> 01:06:03,155
No.

772
01:06:03,975 --> 01:06:09,100
So, but we, you know, like I said, it's informal, but we have a pretty good idea.

773
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:12,442
The parks division of the DPW is out at these parks every single day.

774
01:06:12,462 --> 01:06:14,884
They kind of see what's going on.

775
01:06:15,465 --> 01:06:19,208
So we have a pretty good feeling in-house of what gets used, what doesn't get used.

776
01:06:19,288 --> 01:06:24,232
We also follow a program around and prep the fields for whatever, maybe a little league or whatever.

777
01:06:25,073 --> 01:06:25,814
So we know,

778
01:06:27,060 --> 01:06:40,144
You know, we know, just like, you know, Kevin Bailey in the Parks Commission, the intensity of use during certain times of the year and then how to maintain the spaces with that intensity that varies throughout the year.

779
01:06:41,024 --> 01:06:42,625
So you may see Morris and Park.

780
01:06:43,788 --> 01:06:45,729
maybe sees no action for years.

781
01:06:46,530 --> 01:06:50,453
And then one year, we're doing work over here.

782
01:06:51,353 --> 01:06:55,316
We had car park under construction at the same time as Gillis in the past year.

783
01:06:55,576 --> 01:07:00,240
So we were juggling things around and trying to figure out, well, we can use this field for that and that field for this.

784
01:07:00,260 --> 01:07:03,282
And that should happen every single year.

785
01:07:03,322 --> 01:07:09,126
Because every single year, we should really have something under construction or something fallow or whatever.

786
01:07:11,251 --> 01:07:17,634
I will say this, Tim, you know, we got a lot of compliments on your staff, your park staff this year.

787
01:07:17,654 --> 01:07:26,138
To be honest with you, they did a really excellent job of preparing the fields and making our constituents very happy.

788
01:07:26,518 --> 01:07:26,698
Nice.

789
01:07:27,377 --> 01:07:30,598
Well, it's a team effort between Kevin Bailey's office and us.

790
01:07:30,658 --> 01:07:31,939
So it's a team effort.

791
01:07:32,239 --> 01:07:41,842
Because sometimes in previous years, if that communication isn't happening seamlessly, we may be prepping the wrong field, or we may not be giving it enough attention, or miss it all together, or whatever.

792
01:07:41,862 --> 01:07:42,482
So yeah.

793
01:07:45,303 --> 01:07:47,084
I appreciate it.

794
01:07:47,104 --> 01:07:50,045
So I think you're also up for the cemetery.

795
01:07:50,265 --> 01:07:50,485
Sure.

796
01:07:51,373 --> 01:07:56,575
All right, so the cemetery, it's a little bit of a different ask, and I'm going to share the screen here.

797
01:07:57,676 --> 01:08:08,880
So just to recap, I'm sure folks remember a little bit of the history here, but we requested some money early on to just get a handle on the situation and do some conceptual work.

798
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:10,821
This is a budget summary for design.

799
01:08:10,861 --> 01:08:13,202
So basically, we saw costs associated with the project.

800
01:08:13,802 --> 01:08:16,423
The project goal would be to preserve

801
01:08:17,095 --> 01:08:20,238
Through renovation to buildings and cemetery.

802
01:08:21,319 --> 01:08:27,945
We have a conceptual estimate for that project, which would be about 8 and a half million dollars or so.

803
01:08:28,472 --> 01:08:31,353
So that's obviously a very large sum of money, and I'm not coming here asking for that.

804
01:08:32,094 --> 01:08:41,718
But what we do know now, because of the early money that this committee invested in the project, we know how much it's going to cost, and we started design.

805
01:08:42,258 --> 01:08:44,099
So right now, we're in design development.

806
01:08:44,119 --> 01:08:50,081
We're in contract with Foster Architecture to get to the next milestone of design, which would be design development.

807
01:08:50,821 --> 01:08:57,084
From design development, that's where we can do really fun stuff, where we can start showing plans to agencies and start

808
01:08:57,883 --> 01:09:05,787
thinking about the best way to bid it out, fund it, break it apart, and how to basically purchase the product and how to fund it.

809
01:09:05,807 --> 01:09:07,288
So that's why design development is fun.

810
01:09:09,049 --> 01:09:20,574
The ask tonight is, can we take that $200,000 and now that we know what it's going to cost to design, can we round up the design to bring us all the way through construction documents for both buildings?

811
01:09:21,435 --> 01:09:25,757
So the minimum that we would need to fill that gap is in red there on this chart.

812
01:09:26,597 --> 01:09:28,258
So I'll just explain this real quick.

813
01:09:28,498 --> 01:09:41,587
The two buildings are on the left, maintenance building, office and caretaker's quarters, and the preliminary design costs right at the top there, 50K, design development, these are all proposed costs to bring both buildings through DT.

814
01:09:41,968 --> 01:09:43,308
There's a site survey in there which

815
01:09:44,469 --> 01:09:50,110
I'm recommending that happen during the early phase because I believe there's some exterior work that should be done.

816
01:09:50,811 --> 01:09:57,132
Now that exterior work is an add alternate, so over on the right, there are add alternate design costs that could be added in.

817
01:09:57,852 --> 01:10:03,414
Right now, that red number in the CD design phase does not include it, that $84,550.

818
01:10:03,614 --> 01:10:06,534
That's just the baseline to get us the construction documents.

819
01:10:08,495 --> 01:10:11,236
The study phase is completed, so that's the next column over.

820
01:10:14,140 --> 01:10:15,140
design phase breakdown.

821
01:10:16,441 --> 01:10:20,762
So we're here now in DD design phase.

822
01:10:20,822 --> 01:10:23,802
The cost, the total cost for both buildings is $134,000.

823
01:10:24,702 --> 01:10:28,623
This board granted us $200,000 in last round.

824
01:10:28,944 --> 01:10:31,024
So that is going towards that DD cost.

825
01:10:31,084 --> 01:10:35,005
We'll have some leftover for construction documents.

826
01:10:35,755 --> 01:10:38,457
which that total cost is $150,000 shown here.

827
01:10:39,357 --> 01:10:48,784
And if we give this project $84,550, that brings us right up to construction, basically shelf-ready, ready to bid.

828
01:10:49,504 --> 01:10:55,328
And we believe that will help leverage the project into construction phase, as it always does.

829
01:10:55,768 --> 01:10:59,053
So shelf-ready projects are really what folks want to see to fund.

830
01:10:59,333 --> 01:11:05,582
If we can demonstrate that we're ready to go, then we should be able to successfully fund it.

831
01:11:05,622 --> 01:11:06,584
That's the idea anyway.

832
01:11:07,418 --> 01:11:10,059
Um, the add alternates over to the right.

833
01:11:10,159 --> 01:11:17,562
If this board chose and you had extra money and you wanted to give it to this project, then we could take all the way up to an additional $67,540.

834
01:11:19,003 --> 01:11:32,469
And that would include the exterior, the landscape architecture and the site design, which would include things like a small parking area, um, and, uh, improving the entryways to the buildings, things like that.

835
01:11:34,230 --> 01:11:34,330
So.

836
01:11:35,133 --> 01:11:46,402
Just a quick question of that sure site design entryways would that be what's needed for accessible entry to the building.

837
01:11:46,802 --> 01:11:54,147
So, the cost for the building does include accessible entry and accessible public area area.

838
01:11:55,208 --> 01:12:07,336
but it wouldn't include any portion of the building on the site that has some gray area overlap is any sort of ramp structure or accessible entrance that's needed.

839
01:12:07,356 --> 01:12:09,017
So that would be part of the building costs.

840
01:12:09,537 --> 01:12:21,605
But say if there was accessible handicap parking spaces that we needed to bring to the building, we'll bring the people from the parking spaces to the building, that would be a part of the site design.

841
01:12:22,185 --> 01:12:24,507
So that would be included on this right, this add alternate.

842
01:12:25,133 --> 01:12:25,633
Okay.

843
01:12:25,894 --> 01:12:33,240
So site design, add alternative site design, landscaping, and... That would be really it.

844
01:12:33,660 --> 01:12:34,361
Yeah.

845
01:12:34,421 --> 01:12:36,563
And there's some opportunities there that we've identified.

846
01:12:36,623 --> 01:12:47,312
Like, for example, if there is bathroom space that could be for the public in the maintenance building, then does that need a parking space closer

847
01:12:49,208 --> 01:12:53,750
example, things like that may impact a site design.

848
01:12:54,750 --> 01:13:02,894
So that's also something that could be funded separately, which is why I've listed it separately.

849
01:13:03,254 --> 01:13:10,477
But my main primary goal would be to get this project into construction document level.

850
01:13:12,678 --> 01:13:14,239
I see Kaylene has her hand raised.

851
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:16,700
Hi, thanks.

852
01:13:17,080 --> 01:13:18,181
It's going to be a silly question,

853
01:13:19,545 --> 01:13:22,246
So who's funding the construction of this?

854
01:13:22,466 --> 01:13:23,746
So this is all design, right?

855
01:13:23,766 --> 01:13:25,227
This is all design.

856
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:28,468
We do not have construction funding at the moment.

857
01:13:28,648 --> 01:13:29,868
But there's opportunities.

858
01:13:30,448 --> 01:13:35,870
We're trying to work with the historic commission, although I don't know how much we've done quite yet.

859
01:13:35,930 --> 01:13:39,111
But we really need to have design development drawings to do much of anything.

860
01:13:40,031 --> 01:13:47,013
But the idea would be to get on the state list for funding a construction project

861
01:13:47,967 --> 01:13:49,289
with historic preservation needs.

862
01:13:49,849 --> 01:13:51,131
So that's an opportunity.

863
01:13:51,151 --> 01:13:53,573
I think the city should probably pony up some money.

864
01:13:53,593 --> 01:14:01,402
I think that the perpetual care fund maybe could be looked at for some potential funding.

865
01:14:02,663 --> 01:14:04,025
And then potentially this board too.

866
01:14:04,405 --> 01:14:07,609
I don't think any entity is going to fully fund the project.

867
01:14:07,669 --> 01:14:08,770
I don't think anybody has.

868
01:14:09,723 --> 01:14:13,464
$8.5 million to send our way, unless we get some amazing grant or something.

869
01:14:13,924 --> 01:14:21,786
So the idea is to take the design development drawings and to peel off, so to speak, biddable projects.

870
01:14:22,206 --> 01:14:23,586
It may be windows.

871
01:14:23,766 --> 01:14:25,086
It may be plumbing.

872
01:14:25,166 --> 01:14:27,567
It may be accessible entrance.

873
01:14:27,807 --> 01:14:30,408
It may be things like that.

874
01:14:30,428 --> 01:14:31,228
So you get the idea.

875
01:14:32,368 --> 01:14:36,992
We're not asking the public or any single entity to say, hey, buy this all.

876
01:14:37,393 --> 01:14:41,316
We have $8.5 million worth of work, and it's the only way to do it.

877
01:14:41,777 --> 01:14:44,299
We very much see this.

878
01:14:44,319 --> 01:14:49,544
So that 8.5, you keep on saying, is that the estimated amount?

879
01:14:50,484 --> 01:14:52,887
That is the estimated construction cost value.

880
01:14:53,867 --> 01:14:53,927
OK.

881
01:14:54,028 --> 01:14:54,168
OK.

882
01:14:56,556 --> 01:14:56,916
Today.

883
01:14:57,057 --> 01:14:57,377
Today.

884
01:14:57,557 --> 01:14:57,877
Correct.

885
01:14:58,037 --> 01:14:58,398
You got it.

886
01:14:58,638 --> 01:14:59,479
Today's dollars.

887
01:14:59,599 --> 01:15:03,442
All of the estimates that everybody any every year is on construction projects are today's dollars.

888
01:15:05,824 --> 01:15:06,625
Other questions.

889
01:15:08,146 --> 01:15:09,087
Yeah, just a couple.

890
01:15:11,357 --> 01:15:16,420
I thought when I read the construction costs, it was a typo.

891
01:15:16,921 --> 01:15:28,168
I guess I'd like to see the copy of the Didi drawings when they're done, just because $8.5 million, that's like eight houses being built from scratch.

892
01:15:29,348 --> 01:15:32,870
The scale of it just doesn't feel right to me.

893
01:15:34,171 --> 01:15:35,732
The buildings are being restored.

894
01:15:35,752 --> 01:15:38,014
They're being renovated.

895
01:15:39,134 --> 01:15:43,618
the cost per square foot must be in the thousands of dollars per square foot to get to that amount of money.

896
01:15:44,739 --> 01:15:48,542
I can't see where there's $8 million of construction.

897
01:15:49,082 --> 01:16:03,054
Just for reference, the Embel Carriage House is about a $3 million project, and that's rebuilding a building that is missing a third of its roof and all new systems and gutting it down to the walls.

898
01:16:03,074 --> 01:16:04,195
The number just seems

899
01:16:05,346 --> 01:16:08,207
crazy high to me, but that's why I need to see the drawings.

900
01:16:08,247 --> 01:16:09,128
I need to understand it better.

901
01:16:09,728 --> 01:16:13,830
Yeah, so I think, Teresa, you have the conceptual estimate.

902
01:16:13,870 --> 01:16:16,551
So you guys have the conceptual estimate from last round.

903
01:16:17,071 --> 01:16:18,872
It's two buildings, not just one.

904
01:16:19,292 --> 01:16:24,494
And one is a stone building with extensive work associated with it.

905
01:16:25,895 --> 01:16:30,197
And then the wood-framed building also has extensive work.

906
01:16:31,519 --> 01:16:41,745
not electrical systems, plumbing systems, window systems, exterior siding systems, all problematic that we believe there's water damage in the building.

907
01:16:42,685 --> 01:16:45,947
We're talking pretty big projects here, Doug.

908
01:16:47,208 --> 01:16:52,791
So we did share the conceptual estimates and the conceptual study with this group.

909
01:16:52,831 --> 01:16:54,092
So you guys have that on file.

910
01:16:54,112 --> 01:16:55,333
You can always resend it if needed.

911
01:16:56,450 --> 01:16:58,612
And some of the earlier studies we shared as well.

912
01:16:58,912 --> 01:16:59,652
I hope you are right.

913
01:16:59,812 --> 01:17:04,055
I hope it is more like a couple million dollars per building or something like that.

914
01:17:05,777 --> 01:17:11,581
I always like to see conservative estimates on the start of a project.

915
01:17:12,241 --> 01:17:15,683
I'd like to see design development costs quite a bit lower.

916
01:17:17,064 --> 01:17:20,007
But again, we don't even have a schematic design estimate right now.

917
01:17:20,287 --> 01:17:24,590
We have a conceptual estimate based off of study work and just

918
01:17:25,306 --> 01:17:26,487
visits by architects.

919
01:17:27,567 --> 01:17:39,015
And I would say that I was told that a lot of the costs for the maintenance building are associated with the stone construction.

920
01:17:40,898 --> 01:17:41,118
Okay.

921
01:17:41,538 --> 01:17:42,499
I mean, that's, that's helpful.

922
01:17:42,519 --> 01:17:55,849
I just, I just, the more detailed the better, just, I mean, trying to find $8 million is, is, is, I mean, even the preservation projects fund, they, you know, the most we ever got as a city was about a quarter million dollars.

923
01:17:55,889 --> 01:18:00,192
You know, the, the, the whole total amount is, is only about four or $5 million.

924
01:18:00,252 --> 01:18:03,174
And then I'm, you know, I want to try to see,

925
01:18:05,010 --> 01:18:12,373
getting that amount of money is going to be, as you know, will be, will be very challenging and you don't want to phase it over 30 years either, you know?

926
01:18:12,453 --> 01:18:12,693
No, no.

927
01:18:12,873 --> 01:18:15,554
And yeah, that's why, and we know that it's large sum of money.

928
01:18:15,614 --> 01:18:19,736
So that's why we're trying to see if we can split this up into biddable projects right now.

929
01:18:19,756 --> 01:18:33,421
Uh, it's embarrassing to tell you the truth, the conditions that we have city employees, uh, working out of at both the maintenance building and the, uh, the, the guests, I'm sorry, the, um, the, the, the office building.

930
01:18:34,035 --> 01:18:36,717
I encourage folks to visit.

931
01:18:37,697 --> 01:18:38,718
Not a lot of folks do.

932
01:18:39,418 --> 01:18:42,380
And a lot of this is deferred maintenance.

933
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:49,924
And I feel like the asset management has gone wrong at this point.

934
01:18:50,064 --> 01:18:54,827
So I'm hoping to at least get this place respectable.

935
01:18:55,759 --> 01:18:59,822
If we don't do the entire project and do the full preservation, I'm okay with that.

936
01:18:59,882 --> 01:19:25,462
I know a lot of other people won't, it's from a historic standpoint, but I just, one of the things I really need to happen is have an accessible and appropriate experience for people visiting the cemetery in the office that's modern and not like it's, you know, from the past, and an employee muster area that is safe, healthy, and appealing

937
01:19:26,192 --> 01:19:27,032
to come to work to.

938
01:19:27,853 --> 01:19:29,073
Those are really my goals.

939
01:19:30,034 --> 01:19:36,316
Now we have historic buildings that we're dealing with, so that is obviously something that is important and we're gonna contend with.

940
01:19:37,137 --> 01:19:47,101
But at some point we have to come to the realization that these folks that work here and the public need better spaces for their solemn business.

941
01:19:47,121 --> 01:19:51,943
It could be a nice idea to have a

942
01:19:52,533 --> 01:20:01,059
CPC field trip to the cemetery and see all the work that's either done or needed at the cemetery, Reggie says no.

943
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:07,244
I feel like he'll spend enough time there in the future.

944
01:20:07,424 --> 01:20:09,205
He doesn't plan to ever go there.

945
01:20:09,546 --> 01:20:13,008
I'm happy to give a tour if anybody would like to stop by.

946
01:20:13,028 --> 01:20:14,089
Talking about potentially

947
01:20:19,978 --> 01:20:21,939
breaking this down into phases in the future.

948
01:20:21,959 --> 01:20:26,982
First of all, I'd really be interested in seeing a list of potential funding sources that you're aware of.

949
01:20:27,222 --> 01:20:28,083
Sure.

950
01:20:28,543 --> 01:20:36,227
I am always collecting these ideas because I, there are so many municipal buildings that need so much work.

951
01:20:36,668 --> 01:20:40,050
I would love to know where the money comes from to do it, but also.

952
01:20:40,070 --> 01:20:40,830
You too.

953
01:20:40,890 --> 01:20:43,391
National appropriation works for the hunger.

954
01:20:43,432 --> 01:20:43,692
Yeah.

955
01:20:43,712 --> 01:20:43,992
Good.

956
01:20:50,060 --> 01:21:19,197
the so when you have your construction documents would you be able to perhaps identify what some of the the phases are that you could break it into and the order of operations because obviously you don't want to repair all of the windows when everything else needs to still get ripped out like you're you know you can't do things in in order where they're going to have to be disturbed again so i wonder if there's a way to

957
01:21:19,955 --> 01:21:24,521
show how to possibly tackle this in phases?

958
01:21:25,082 --> 01:21:25,482
Sure.

959
01:21:25,502 --> 01:21:32,111
So we've had a plan in place that basically

960
01:21:34,054 --> 01:21:40,440
The discussion has been through the design development process, our architect would do that work.

961
01:21:40,580 --> 01:21:53,071
Basically, what can be done independently, what can be spun off and bid out and done without causing an excessive cost implication to some other phase down the line, reopening walls or whatnot.

962
01:21:53,812 --> 01:21:58,656
One of the things I know that we've talked about as one of the more immediate needs is electric.

963
01:22:01,142 --> 01:22:09,127
That's a kind of a can of worms because once you, from what I understand, once you start opening the walls to replace electric and you put it back together, you probably want to put it back together correctly.

964
01:22:09,567 --> 01:22:11,208
So that becomes one project.

965
01:22:11,368 --> 01:22:16,671
And when you are built, the walls open well, probably should upgrade plumbing if it needs to be upgraded as well.

966
01:22:17,251 --> 01:22:19,873
Um, but for something like that, you don't necessarily need to do the windows.

967
01:22:20,593 --> 01:22:27,257
So there's, um, yeah, you want to do things in the order that they need to be done and in groups.

968
01:22:28,067 --> 01:22:40,852
So just for scale, because I've worked a lot with CPA funding, and our annual funding allocation is in the range of $2 million for Medford.

969
01:22:41,012 --> 01:22:47,955
And most projects that fit within our budget are in the $100,000 to $500,000 range, something in that range.

970
01:22:52,726 --> 01:22:57,452
is comfortable like you've done with the athletic fields to handle one at a time.

971
01:22:57,492 --> 01:23:06,863
So I don't know if you're able to identify phasing in that range in a few years, you can tackle a lot of the needs of those buildings.

972
01:23:07,304 --> 01:23:07,704
I think so.

973
01:23:07,744 --> 01:23:08,445
That's what I'm hoping.

974
01:23:08,565 --> 01:23:12,710
Yeah, I'm hoping to Doug's point, if it truly is this very expensive

975
01:23:16,448 --> 01:23:20,211
Personally, I may not be interested in executing it soup to nuts.

976
01:23:20,271 --> 01:23:25,013
I may only be interested in executing it to a point where it's a successful job.

977
01:23:25,414 --> 01:23:27,835
We've done some preservation work, but you know what?

978
01:23:27,995 --> 01:23:32,718
Maybe a big chunk of that can be deferred even a little bit longer without causing excessive damage.

979
01:23:33,718 --> 01:23:37,340
That's another reason why we want to take a look at it from this approach.

980
01:23:37,441 --> 01:23:38,301
What can we break off?

981
01:23:38,621 --> 01:23:39,522
What can we do now?

982
01:23:39,882 --> 01:23:40,843
What can we do later?

983
01:23:49,287 --> 01:23:55,891
is complete design development and see what we can begin to peel off the construction and what those costs look like.

984
01:23:56,251 --> 01:24:09,700
So we can say to this committee or the mayor or a grant funding source, hey, we want you to fund this piece and this piece costs $500,000 or $1 million or whatever.

985
01:24:10,681 --> 01:24:13,823
And given that the cemetery's role in the community

986
01:24:17,650 --> 01:24:28,212
It seems like a kind of facility where it would make sense to invite maybe community donations to this major capital improvement.

987
01:24:28,232 --> 01:24:33,133
And I wonder, so the cemetery must already have a revolving fund.

988
01:24:33,593 --> 01:24:41,755
Is there any way to create a capital improvement fund that like people could get a

989
01:24:43,633 --> 01:24:54,237
a plate in honor of their loved one installed in the building if they will donate to the improvement of the building.

990
01:24:54,257 --> 01:24:58,238
Yeah, a brick or a plaque type of program.

991
01:24:58,499 --> 01:24:59,819
I think that's a great idea.

992
01:24:59,919 --> 01:25:01,720
Especially since a lot of people

993
01:25:03,063 --> 01:25:11,247
nowadays are cremating and probably not burying, but they might still like to have a marker and they could purchase a marker to put it on the building.

994
01:25:11,367 --> 01:25:14,749
Yeah, yeah, I mean that's a great idea.

995
01:25:14,929 --> 01:25:27,015
To address the revolving fund idea that you were bringing up, the cemetery has revenue sources, perpetual care, it provides revenue to our operational fund.

996
01:25:28,416 --> 01:25:29,657
That happens

997
01:25:30,997 --> 01:25:36,040
basically off the interest so we don't tap into it for capital needs.

998
01:25:36,580 --> 01:25:45,685
The city's capital program capital improvement plan does have projects this is one of them on that plan as well so the city also funds capital

999
01:25:47,712 --> 01:25:51,133
commission and do the operations of the property.

1000
01:25:52,113 --> 01:25:55,455
And then we also have revenue from sale of lots.

1001
01:25:56,095 --> 01:26:06,618
So sale of lots can go to feed the perpetual care fund, but it also goes to feed the operational expenses of the cemetery.

1002
01:26:07,098 --> 01:26:12,120
Those funds are managed by the cemetery trust.

1003
01:26:14,716 --> 01:26:31,546
Okay, so I don't know whether what I'm thinking of fits within that framework or if there's like potential to create a new kind of account that would invite people to make memorial donations to the restoration of the buildings.

1004
01:26:31,566 --> 01:26:41,032
Yeah, I think it would be something different because a perpetual care doesn't wouldn't be able, I don't think, to provide for the capital improvement entirely.

1005
01:26:44,458 --> 01:26:45,798
to like what they did with the library.

1006
01:26:46,398 --> 01:26:50,519
And I think, yeah, some sort of donor program is, I think, is a really good idea, Roberta.

1007
01:26:50,579 --> 01:26:52,159
So I'm making a note of that.

1008
01:26:53,660 --> 01:26:55,900
I'll keep it on a list of potential funding sources.

1009
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:59,741
Thank you.

1010
01:27:00,101 --> 01:27:00,301
Yeah.

1011
01:27:00,521 --> 01:27:02,161
Any other questions, comments?

1012
01:27:04,741 --> 01:27:05,682
Well, thank you very much.

1013
01:27:05,702 --> 01:27:08,742
I think that concludes everyone we have with us today.

1014
01:27:08,762 --> 01:27:13,543
And we will have to see if we can find another date to reschedule our other

1015
01:27:14,044 --> 01:27:14,604
applicant.

1016
01:27:15,865 --> 01:27:17,246
All right, well, thank you very much for your time.

1017
01:27:17,266 --> 01:27:19,128
Good luck on this round of funding.

1018
01:27:19,148 --> 01:27:19,748
Thank you.

1019
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:42,521
Oh, okay.

1020
01:27:42,621 --> 01:27:42,881
All right.

1021
01:27:42,901 --> 01:27:43,621
Sounds good.

1022
01:27:43,661 --> 01:27:43,841
Thanks.

1023
01:27:44,002 --> 01:27:51,367
Well, thank you to Ruby, tough student who's here to observe and learn about affordable housing and funding.

1024
01:27:52,067 --> 01:27:52,368
Yeah.

1025
01:27:52,428 --> 01:27:53,268
Any, any comments yet?

1026
01:28:10,594 --> 01:28:10,994
ahead.

1027
01:28:11,054 --> 01:28:11,795
First things first.

1028
01:28:12,195 --> 01:28:12,436
Yeah.

1029
01:28:14,337 --> 01:28:19,000
Can we get a breakdown of what we got left over from the preceding year?

1030
01:28:19,401 --> 01:28:22,023
Us, what we have available for 2024?

1031
01:28:22,463 --> 01:28:24,525
Yes, I can share that right now.

1032
01:28:24,605 --> 01:28:29,068
It was in the Dropbox that there's kind of like a financials snapshot.

1033
01:28:29,248 --> 01:28:32,811
I'm having a problem getting into my Dropbox for some reason.

1034
01:28:32,851 --> 01:28:33,992
I'm not exactly sure.

1035
01:28:34,752 --> 01:28:37,514
And I'm totally technically illiterate.

1036
01:28:38,575 --> 01:28:39,075
Sorry.

1037
01:28:39,135 --> 01:28:39,676
Sorry for the

1038
01:28:41,720 --> 01:28:43,501
Not really, not illiterate.

1039
01:28:43,522 --> 01:28:46,264
I feel like we reviewed this at the end of our last webinar.

1040
01:28:46,324 --> 01:28:47,545
We did.

1041
01:28:47,605 --> 01:28:48,566
It was pretty close.

1042
01:28:48,926 --> 01:28:50,047
Yeah.

1043
01:28:50,207 --> 01:28:53,189
One question I was going to ask, hold on one second.

1044
01:28:53,229 --> 01:29:00,575
One thing I had meant to ask Tim, I think

1045
01:29:06,977 --> 01:29:10,279
The largest app we have is for those playstead tennis courts.

1046
01:29:10,519 --> 01:29:15,601
It represents 28% of our entire budget is just in that one project.

1047
01:29:16,122 --> 01:29:34,111
A question I was going to have for Tim was if he were to prioritize, since he represents two projects as one single applicant, if you were to prioritize those projects, as well as he had also, I don't know if you all caught it, he had also said, if you guys feel willing to give us an additional 67,000 or so,

1048
01:29:37,057 --> 01:29:49,948
If we were to forego the place said, for budgetary reasons, could we add that additional 67 into his 85 ask?

1049
01:29:50,008 --> 01:29:50,669
I think it was 85.

1050
01:29:50,829 --> 01:29:57,915
So that was a question I can ask him, because I think that might be, I'm not trying to put thoughts into anybody.

1051
01:29:57,935 --> 01:30:01,278
One particular person said, it's just, this is a big ask.

1052
01:30:02,078 --> 01:30:03,820
I feel like we can't forego it though.

1053
01:30:06,865 --> 01:30:12,667
I mean, when we talked about that number before seeing the pictures and stuff, I was like, yeah, it's a lot.

1054
01:30:13,047 --> 01:30:16,347
But those are the courts everyone plays at, and they're non-functional.

1055
01:30:17,048 --> 01:30:19,188
How could we not fund that?

1056
01:30:20,889 --> 01:30:21,889
I used to deliberate.

1057
01:30:21,909 --> 01:30:22,909
I don't know.

1058
01:30:22,929 --> 01:30:35,112
I walked across those courts last week, and I thought, boy, if I had to choose between having tennis courts without cracks in them versus having a functional men's room,

1059
01:30:35,923 --> 01:30:36,764
in City Hall.

1060
01:30:36,784 --> 01:30:41,968
Be careful now.

1061
01:30:42,168 --> 01:30:44,490
Be careful.

1062
01:30:44,530 --> 01:30:49,734
You're on candid camera.

1063
01:30:49,774 --> 01:30:51,455
We'll be deliberating next week.

1064
01:30:51,535 --> 01:30:54,057
One of the things I think we want to think about is strategize.

1065
01:30:54,077 --> 01:31:00,122
How do we want to think about our deliberations so that we can make these choices?

1066
01:31:01,042 --> 01:31:03,685
What would the alternative funding stream be for these projects?

1067
01:31:05,977 --> 01:31:15,502
If the reparation type things are primarily turning to us, but like City Hall might be able to get the cash like that.

1068
01:31:15,542 --> 01:31:17,142
You said 23% of our budget?

1069
01:31:17,162 --> 01:31:20,744
23% of our budget would be for the place that?

1070
01:31:20,764 --> 01:31:20,744
28%.

1071
01:31:20,804 --> 01:31:21,885
Give or take.

1072
01:31:21,905 --> 01:31:27,927
Again, I'm not trying to sway anybody.

1073
01:31:27,967 --> 01:31:30,369
Well, don't shoot me.

1074
01:31:30,409 --> 01:31:35,191
That's why I asked about the cracks, because aside from the cracks, those courts look pretty nice.

1075
01:31:36,218 --> 01:31:36,698
You know?

1076
01:31:37,579 --> 01:31:37,859
Yeah.

1077
01:31:37,939 --> 01:31:40,700
I mean, I don't play tennis, so I don't know what that's like.

1078
01:31:41,860 --> 01:31:42,440
Right.

1079
01:31:42,500 --> 01:31:43,741
I will say this.

1080
01:31:44,021 --> 01:31:44,721
I will say this.

1081
01:31:46,702 --> 01:31:59,087
I do believe that either the boys' high school or the girls' high school used this place as an alternative to Duggar.

1082
01:31:59,587 --> 01:32:04,609
At one point in time, several years back before Duggar was resurfaced,

1083
01:32:05,843 --> 01:32:18,646
they were disqualified from using Duggar as a place to hold tournament games because of the cracks and so on and so forth.

1084
01:32:18,706 --> 01:32:25,988
Now, having said that, playset is not one of the places that we would use for that type of a situation.

1085
01:32:29,389 --> 01:32:34,530
But I've seen some of the repairs that they've done on these courts, and yes, they are

1086
01:32:35,220 --> 01:32:35,780
temporary.

1087
01:32:37,481 --> 01:32:40,223
We've had some good weather lately.

1088
01:32:40,243 --> 01:32:47,868
For the past four or five years, we haven't had an awful lot of snow and not a lot of ice and so on and so forth.

1089
01:32:47,888 --> 01:32:53,251
So I don't think that the cracks have gotten exponentially worse.

1090
01:32:54,492 --> 01:32:56,834
But who knows what this winter's going to give.

1091
01:32:57,714 --> 01:32:58,315
We just don't know.

1092
01:32:58,855 --> 01:33:01,316
So it's tough.

1093
01:33:03,783 --> 01:33:09,444
and we'll give you X amount to fix the cracks, probably.

1094
01:33:09,764 --> 01:33:15,586
Because if you just send somebody down from the DBW office to fill in the cracks, that's probably not optimal.

1095
01:33:15,606 --> 01:33:17,086
But that's not a CPA grant.

1096
01:33:17,166 --> 01:33:18,466
They can't do that.

1097
01:33:18,847 --> 01:33:19,127
Yeah.

1098
01:33:19,567 --> 01:33:21,527
Yeah, maintenance is.

1099
01:33:21,607 --> 01:33:28,009
So the question is whether they're coming to us to replace them rather than actually going to their own budget to maintain them.

1100
01:33:28,869 --> 01:33:33,410
So because it's easier to get money to replace

1101
01:33:35,012 --> 01:33:40,014
then I wonder if that's an inappropriate use of our funding.

1102
01:33:42,254 --> 01:33:46,195
Can you compel them to do that study that you keep mentioning?

1103
01:33:47,276 --> 01:33:52,257
It does seem really problematic that there's tennis courts around the city that don't get any play.

1104
01:33:52,617 --> 01:33:56,618
Of course, certain tennis courts are going to get effed up really fast.

1105
01:33:56,678 --> 01:33:58,359
They're going to get all the play.

1106
01:33:59,659 --> 01:34:03,282
Well, I want to respect everyone's time we have.

1107
01:34:03,302 --> 01:34:09,027
And yeah, we have, we'll be deliberating next week or next month.

1108
01:34:10,068 --> 01:34:14,391
So we'll have a chance to like really go through all of these.

1109
01:34:14,812 --> 01:34:26,982
I think what worked the last time was to rank everything in terms of high, medium, low priority, in our opinion.

1110
01:34:27,923 --> 01:34:43,054
And then compare that prioritization so that we could figure out which are the projects that are first in line for the funding and which in the end might be projects that we have to ask to come back later.

1111
01:34:43,514 --> 01:34:49,278
Or we might be able to look at the projects and think whether any of them could be broken into smaller pieces.

1112
01:34:52,475 --> 01:35:01,042
It wasn't there about a roughly $600,000 delta between what we have and what the requests added up to?

1113
01:35:01,542 --> 01:35:03,944
Is it more than a half million dollars difference?

1114
01:35:04,244 --> 01:35:05,665
Do I have that wrong?

1115
01:35:05,685 --> 01:35:10,269
I think we narrowed the gap, yeah, because there was carryover money from last year.

1116
01:35:10,389 --> 01:35:10,789
Correct.

1117
01:35:11,209 --> 01:35:14,692
So our asks are $2.4, the budget of $1.9 million.

1118
01:35:18,623 --> 01:35:21,545
And then we carried over about $675,000.

1119
01:35:21,645 --> 01:35:27,569
So right now, if we were to award everything that was asked, we do have the funding available.

1120
01:35:28,249 --> 01:35:33,773
That would leave us with roughly $120,000 left in our coffers.

1121
01:35:34,633 --> 01:35:40,917
We had agreed as a committee that we'd like to keep $225,000 in our coffers.

1122
01:35:41,117 --> 01:35:47,582
So if we were to award all of the applications, we do have the money to cover it, but it would leave us with only $125,000.

1123
01:35:48,398 --> 01:35:50,059
20-ish in our bank.

1124
01:35:51,780 --> 01:35:52,221
That's good.

1125
01:35:52,861 --> 01:35:55,863
That's not a bad position to be in.

1126
01:35:56,123 --> 01:35:56,324
Yeah.

1127
01:35:56,524 --> 01:35:56,844
All right.

1128
01:35:57,064 --> 01:36:03,369
So we'll have, yeah, we'll come back next time.

1129
01:36:03,669 --> 01:36:16,458
And in the meantime, if anybody has any specific questions on any of the applications, I can certainly, yes, I have some homework to meet with all the applicants on, but if you have any questions that pop into your head,

1130
01:36:17,817 --> 01:36:19,799
feel free to send them to me and I'll work on getting answers.

1131
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:26,549
So just to recap- Do you know what the total of the ABCD has been so far?

1132
01:36:28,621 --> 01:36:34,265
In terms of, they don't have any more money left, they've used up what we've already awarded in the past.

1133
01:36:34,485 --> 01:36:38,928
Right, so my questions are really about how much have we given them so far?

1134
01:36:38,948 --> 01:36:48,455
And have we gotten reports from them as to how that money was spent and what Medford residents benefited from that money?

1135
01:36:49,135 --> 01:36:51,096
I have that information and I can provide that.

1136
01:36:51,217 --> 01:36:53,158
Yeah, that would be really helpful.

1137
01:36:53,598 --> 01:36:55,339
I feel like I'm having deja vu.

1138
01:36:57,396 --> 01:36:59,297
Of that last year, didn't we ask them to prepare that?

1139
01:36:59,317 --> 01:37:00,538
And I didn't, I don't know.

1140
01:37:00,818 --> 01:37:02,499
I don't know.

1141
01:37:02,840 --> 01:37:05,661
Our other program, which is housing families.

1142
01:37:06,422 --> 01:37:07,322
Oh, sorry.

1143
01:37:07,402 --> 01:37:09,804
It's almost identical.

1144
01:37:09,824 --> 01:37:10,044
Yeah.

1145
01:37:10,224 --> 01:37:11,065
Same question.

1146
01:37:11,145 --> 01:37:12,406
I'm allowed to say stuff like that.

1147
01:37:13,486 --> 01:37:15,588
That's a good point.

1148
01:37:16,588 --> 01:37:19,370
So we still have to hear from them and from Shiloh.

1149
01:37:19,590 --> 01:37:20,431
Are those the last two?

1150
01:37:21,508 --> 01:37:22,689
We already heard from Shiloh.

1151
01:37:22,709 --> 01:37:29,374
We told them that their presentation to us in September would serve as their presentation.

1152
01:37:29,394 --> 01:37:35,478
But we'll just add them to the regular funding stream when we deliberate.

1153
01:37:37,359 --> 01:37:39,821
With additional information, right?

1154
01:37:40,021 --> 01:37:42,482
So did Shiloh owe us additional information?

1155
01:37:42,502 --> 01:37:43,143
I think they did.

1156
01:37:44,465 --> 01:37:48,368
They did send me something this morning that I haven't been able to fully digest.

1157
01:37:48,408 --> 01:37:54,872
There's a new architect on their team that still with the same architectural firm.

1158
01:37:54,892 --> 01:37:58,615
It's just I have to understand their communication style.

1159
01:38:00,456 --> 01:38:05,300
But there was some information provided since this wasn't an agenda item.

1160
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:06,040
I didn't really.

1161
01:38:07,963 --> 01:38:17,488
So what we'll be looking forward to help us the next time is hopefully to hear from the from ABCD about the movement assistance program.

1162
01:38:18,829 --> 01:38:19,049
St.

1163
01:38:19,089 --> 01:38:32,817
Francis is going to do some homework and give and hopefully meet with the historical commission and work out a treatment plan that's compliant and then give us a very clear scope and budget for their project.

1164
01:38:33,473 --> 01:38:35,515
kind of fill in the things that were made.

1165
01:38:36,836 --> 01:38:50,606
And any more new information that we get from Shiloh or that we get from any other applicants, we'll add that new information.

1166
01:38:50,626 --> 01:38:52,848
And then what do we need?

1167
01:38:53,008 --> 01:38:59,412
So we have the accounting of how much money was carried over, how much money is available this year.

1168
01:38:59,432 --> 01:39:02,775
So all of that, you've been clearly giving us a statement of

1169
01:39:03,095 --> 01:39:11,802
Is there anything else that we need from Teresa to help us with our deliberation process?

1170
01:39:16,086 --> 01:39:16,927
So, okay.

1171
01:39:17,207 --> 01:39:28,997
I think- I had some notes from last time about the City Hall bathroom updates and the Heckner Center that there was no quote or something like that.

1172
01:39:29,902 --> 01:39:35,924
Yes, they have reached out to their on-call architects to put together formal estimates.

1173
01:39:36,044 --> 01:39:37,245
Those are a work in progress.

1174
01:39:38,065 --> 01:39:38,365
Okay.

1175
01:39:38,946 --> 01:39:43,947
And there was the possibility of putting a third sail over the performance space at Riverside.

1176
01:39:44,208 --> 01:39:46,808
Did they give you a new estimate for that?

1177
01:39:48,129 --> 01:39:49,129
I do not have that.

1178
01:39:49,690 --> 01:39:57,873
I went on vacation very shortly after our last meeting, and then Amanda, we had one day back together where she then went on her honeymoon.

1179
01:39:59,474 --> 01:40:03,256
Yes, so feel free to graduate.

1180
01:40:04,477 --> 01:40:12,262
So, we mentioned passing the night, but she is back Thursday and I've already got a. A hot date on her calendar to meet on a couple of things.

1181
01:40:12,302 --> 01:40:12,562
This is.

1182
01:40:12,662 --> 01:40:15,164
Okay, the 4th time.

1183
01:40:16,645 --> 01:40:20,027
Okay, so we'll already speaks for all of us.

1184
01:40:20,267 --> 01:40:20,587
Okay.

1185
01:40:30,234 --> 01:40:43,703
Well, we'll make sure that we have all this follow up and maybe Teresa and I can pregame before the next meeting so we can rapid fire, share all that information that we gather.

1186
01:40:44,043 --> 01:40:51,488
We might possibly have one more presentation at the next meeting and then we can start the deliberating.

1187
01:40:51,588 --> 01:40:59,172
So if our next meeting is in November, November 12th, which is the day after that day,

1188
01:41:00,867 --> 01:41:16,776
We might put together a general plan for what we think we're going to fund at the next meeting and then the following meeting actually vote on the recommendations.

1189
01:41:16,796 --> 01:41:29,062
So we'll give Teresa a little bit of time to prepare the recommendation letters and we can review them and know what our

1190
01:41:31,414 --> 01:41:31,574
Um.

1191
01:41:31,634 --> 01:41:34,555
Conditions are going to be and everything and in December.

1192
01:41:34,575 --> 01:41:39,417
So I think that.

1193
01:41:41,977 --> 01:41:44,918
Should be a plan to get us through the end of the year.

1194
01:41:44,938 --> 01:41:44,998
Any

1195
01:42:00,262 --> 01:42:01,283
I got to call the roll.

1196
01:42:02,224 --> 01:42:02,544
Reg?

1197
01:42:02,824 --> 01:42:03,084
Yes.

1198
01:42:05,646 --> 01:42:05,987
John?

1199
01:42:06,707 --> 01:42:07,027
Yes.

1200
01:42:07,808 --> 01:42:08,148
Doug?

1201
01:42:08,909 --> 01:42:09,329
Yes.

1202
01:42:10,130 --> 01:42:10,650
Kaylene?

1203
01:42:11,491 --> 01:42:11,711
Yes.

1204
01:42:12,692 --> 01:42:13,252
And Ari?

1205
01:42:13,873 --> 01:42:14,173
Yes.

1206
01:42:15,614 --> 01:42:16,815
Thank you, everyone.

1207
01:42:16,835 --> 01:42:27,964
Oh, and before you all go, at our next meeting, we may have a new committee member who we're just trying to get on the council agenda as soon as possible.

1208
01:42:28,124 --> 01:42:28,284
Yes.

1209
01:42:30,162 --> 01:42:31,671
We'll be a full team.

1210
01:42:31,691 --> 01:42:32,355
We'll have a new friend.

1211
01:42:32,375 --> 01:42:34,487
All right.

1212
01:42:34,548 --> 01:42:35,191
Good night, everybody.

1213
01:42:35,252 --> 01:42:35,554
Thank you.

1214
01:42:35,574 --> 01:42:35,936
Good night.
