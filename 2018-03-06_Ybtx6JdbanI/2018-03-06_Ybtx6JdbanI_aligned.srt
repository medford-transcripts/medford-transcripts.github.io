00:07:35,596 --> 00:07:37,137
Sorry.

4
00:07:38,297 --> 00:07:38,538

17
00:08:01,393 --> 00:08:13,258

18
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,161
Approval of the minutes of February 12, 2018.

19
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:24,604
There's a motion on the floor to approve the minutes.

20
00:08:24,664 --> 00:08:25,424
Is there a second?

21
00:08:25,825 --> 00:08:26,425
Seconded by Ms.

22
00:08:26,445 --> 00:08:27,006
Van de Kloet.

23
00:08:27,546 --> 00:08:28,247
All those in favor?

24
00:08:28,267 --> 00:08:28,327
Aye.

25
00:08:29,307 --> 00:08:30,108
All those opposed?

26
00:08:30,829 --> 00:08:31,509
Motion passes.

27
00:08:33,211 --> 00:08:34,031
Approval of bills.

28
00:08:34,111 --> 00:08:34,992
Transfer of funds.

29
00:08:37,074 --> 00:08:37,854
Motion to approve.

30
00:08:37,874 --> 00:08:38,855
Motion to approve by Mr. Benedetto.

31
00:08:38,915 --> 00:08:39,656
Is there a second?

32
00:08:40,276 --> 00:08:41,157
By Mr. Ruggiero.

33
00:08:41,177 --> 00:08:43,539
Roll call vote, please.

34
00:08:44,239 --> 00:08:45,120
Member Di Benedetto.

35
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:45,601
Yes.

36
00:08:46,621 --> 00:08:47,122
Member Prince.

37
00:08:55,516 --> 00:08:55,817
Yes.

38
00:08:55,897 --> 00:08:57,758
Six in the affirmative, one absent.

39
00:08:58,519 --> 00:08:59,319
Motion passes.

40
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,360
Please mark Ms.

41
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,461
Kretz in attendance.

42
00:09:04,884 --> 00:09:05,885
Approval of payrolls.

43
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:08,267
Mr. Benedetto.

44
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:18,215
Just for knowledge and clarification and backup, I am going to request

45
00:09:19,204 --> 00:09:29,993
I'm actually making a motion to receive an Excel spreadsheet with backup info and totals for each weekly and biweekly employee with their salaries.

46
00:09:30,513 --> 00:09:33,696
I would like it on an Excel spreadsheet in alphabetical order.

47
00:09:34,417 --> 00:09:36,539
So you'd like it emailed to me?

48
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:39,081
I would like it emailed to me within two days.

49
00:09:40,182 --> 00:09:47,808
And I would also like to add that I would like it presented at every meeting that payrolls are asked to be approved.

50
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:49,117
moving forward.

51
00:09:49,718 --> 00:09:56,842
The next payrolls that are prepared would be Wednesday, Thursday, Christine, when do you hit the send button?

52
00:09:56,882 --> 00:09:57,382
Wednesday or?

53
00:09:57,402 --> 00:09:57,482
Okay.

54
00:10:03,946 --> 00:10:07,288
So it could be available for probably by Friday.

55
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:11,650
Oh, they could send me last week's and then send next week's Friday.

56
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:16,893
So I'm requesting that for tomorrow, an Excel spreadsheet with

57
00:10:17,223 --> 00:10:33,813
them listed alphabetically for the current school budget for the second half of the year and for it to be moved on to come with backup instead of just approving payrolls like we do, having them back up like we do with the bills.

58
00:10:34,273 --> 00:10:38,255
I'd like that as well on whenever we meet.

59
00:10:38,856 --> 00:10:41,337
So I need one of my members to second that.

60
00:10:41,357 --> 00:10:43,358
So it would be for the prior weeks?

61
00:10:43,378 --> 00:10:44,179
What are you looking for?

62
00:10:45,796 --> 00:10:46,036
Yes.

63
00:10:46,277 --> 00:10:47,798
Approved payroll that's been submitted.

64
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:48,739
Right.

65
00:10:50,101 --> 00:10:50,281
Ms.

66
00:10:50,301 --> 00:10:50,822
Van de Kloot.

67
00:10:51,342 --> 00:10:54,966
Before we rush to approve that, I just, I have some questions for my colleague.

68
00:10:54,986 --> 00:11:00,652
Um, first of all, and I, uh, Christine, um, I'm not.

69
00:11:00,852 --> 00:11:01,013
Ms.

70
00:11:01,053 --> 00:11:02,594
Patterson, could you please step forward?

71
00:11:02,734 --> 00:11:03,035
Thank you.

72
00:11:10,524 --> 00:11:14,907
Is that something you can easily get to us, or is this going to cause a great deal more work?

73
00:11:14,947 --> 00:11:16,588
Well, this is going to be very cumbersome.

74
00:11:17,508 --> 00:11:23,532
The biweekly payroll is approximately a phone book worth of backup material.

75
00:11:23,792 --> 00:11:34,779
So this will take a lot more time to prepare and have available, as there is a lot of detail that goes into a payroll processing.

76
00:11:35,273 --> 00:11:42,657
So I'll amend my motion to have the electronic version for now in an Excel file.

77
00:11:47,019 --> 00:11:49,780
And then you can present the backup at the next meeting.

78
00:11:50,181 --> 00:11:51,741
So that gives you plenty of time.

79
00:11:52,222 --> 00:12:00,966
So as of tomorrow, you can just send me the Excel spreadsheet with the names alphabetically with the current payroll.

80
00:12:01,463 --> 00:12:04,025
who's, what their salary is, all of that.

81
00:12:04,065 --> 00:12:09,970
So I have the backup because I'm approving stuff every week within not one of us sees it just like with the bills.

82
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:12,152
Kathy goes and miss secretary.

83
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:13,473
Oh, miss Kratz.

84
00:12:14,173 --> 00:12:20,638
I'm confused because I signed the bills every week and I see every single invoice and I not pay payroll.

85
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:24,622
I'm asking for payroll months, people's payroll.

86
00:12:24,662 --> 00:12:26,083
I want to see that not bills.

87
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,931
Mayor Burke.

88
00:12:28,971 --> 00:12:32,932
But we know what we have a yearly budget.

89
00:12:33,232 --> 00:12:36,513
And in that yearly budget, we're given the yearly pay rate.

90
00:12:37,414 --> 00:12:41,815
I mean, it sounds as if my colleague is looking for something specific.

91
00:12:42,356 --> 00:12:50,639
And if she's looking for something specific, then perhaps it would be wiser to zone down into it too.

92
00:12:50,859 --> 00:12:52,119
There's a motion on the floor.

93
00:12:52,179 --> 00:12:54,340
I need one of my members to second the motion.

94
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,521
And I request a roll call vote at this point.

95
00:12:57,398 --> 00:13:06,023
Is there a second on the floor to request, in Excel fashion, the payroll after it is submitted, so be emailed, correct?

96
00:13:06,463 --> 00:13:06,703
Great.

97
00:13:07,243 --> 00:13:08,624
And to be presented at meetings.

98
00:13:08,724 --> 00:13:10,065
It could be voluminous.

99
00:13:11,525 --> 00:13:16,868
And that's really an administrative task, not a school committee task.

100
00:13:17,749 --> 00:13:18,949
There's a second on the floor.

101
00:13:18,969 --> 00:13:20,650
Mr. Russo.

102
00:13:21,331 --> 00:13:25,753
So is this a, are we required to provide this in a format on the

103
00:13:26,412 --> 00:13:27,252
on the website.

104
00:13:27,272 --> 00:13:30,133
Not right now.

105
00:13:30,634 --> 00:13:33,135
But if it's approved, we would have to make this public.

106
00:13:34,095 --> 00:13:40,597
And am I correct that printed this is, in fact, going to be another REMA paper per person per meeting?

107
00:13:41,518 --> 00:13:42,378
At the very least.

108
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:55,503
That's why I'm just asking for the Excel spreadsheet to be sent to us of employees' payroll, not asking for paper copies, for the current budget,

109
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,741
And I would like it in alphabetical form.

110
00:13:58,702 --> 00:13:59,723
It's one spreadsheet.

111
00:14:00,183 --> 00:14:02,645
Any payroll department should be able to present it.

112
00:14:03,026 --> 00:14:05,347
Payroll information is public information.

113
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:09,371
I just want to have the data before we vote on it every week.

114
00:14:09,411 --> 00:14:12,773
And I want to be transparent throughout the community as well.

115
00:14:13,494 --> 00:14:20,219
I think it's important for us to have the data because we just vote on it and we don't ever check it.

116
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:22,221
And I think it needs to be looked at.

117
00:14:22,621 --> 00:14:24,002
So that's why I'm requesting

118
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,902
I just have a question.

119
00:14:26,942 --> 00:14:27,222
Correct.

120
00:14:27,863 --> 00:14:30,245
So, I wanted to ask Christine a question.

121
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:38,651
So, Christine, I work at the Massachusetts Retirement System, and I know that the deduction reports get transmitted monthly.

122
00:14:38,892 --> 00:14:39,172
Correct.

123
00:14:39,272 --> 00:14:48,099
So, what happens is, each month, and I don't work on every public school, by the way, because it would be a conflict, but I know I work with other districts, and they report to us monthly.

124
00:14:48,539 --> 00:14:52,943
So, for example, February is due in on March 10th.

125
00:14:53,993 --> 00:15:00,056
Okay, so what happens is the district has until March 10th to give us their electronic file.

126
00:15:00,517 --> 00:15:06,700
And when they import that file, the file can be exported to Excel and sorted alphabetically.

127
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,722
But that's the month after the payroll's due.

128
00:15:10,202 --> 00:15:23,429
And that would be like the soonest, and that would be the most, the easiest way to do it because in myTRS you can generate that report really quickly and just cut out the social security numbers and that could be emailed to somebody, which wouldn't take time.

129
00:15:24,051 --> 00:15:31,895
It's already built into the payroll software from ITRS, the reporting software, but it wouldn't be something that could be done biweekly.

130
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:39,519
I know what's involved because I work with multiple school districts.

131
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,260
That's what I do all day.

132
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:44,342
Mr. Ruggiero?

133
00:15:46,283 --> 00:15:47,464
Yeah, I just have a couple questions.

134
00:15:47,684 --> 00:15:50,605
So first, I'd like to offer a friendly amendment.

135
00:15:50,665 --> 00:15:53,686
Do we need to have this information presented physically?

136
00:15:53,866 --> 00:15:59,649
Is it OK that we just have this information presented as an Excel file or comma delineated database?

137
00:15:59,669 --> 00:15:59,969
Is that OK?

138
00:15:59,989 --> 00:16:01,069
Because that's a lot of paper.

139
00:16:01,129 --> 00:16:01,209
Yeah.

140
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:05,231
So you want the physical?

141
00:16:05,251 --> 00:16:13,115
I want it in an Excel spreadsheet every time people want anything at all to be sensualized.

142
00:16:20,703 --> 00:16:31,456
Yeah, yeah, but I mean, I'm just a friendly man.

143
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:35,742
I think that the paper version just that's a lot of I mean you're looking at

144
00:16:36,262 --> 00:16:37,122
A lot of entries.

145
00:16:37,142 --> 00:16:38,423
Mr. Giroux has the floor right now.

146
00:16:38,563 --> 00:16:47,885
So I would like to offer a friendly amendment if it's accepted that we have this information presented physically and if one of the members needs it to be printed out, then they can request it.

147
00:16:48,505 --> 00:16:51,046
But for me, I would prefer to have this digitally.

148
00:16:51,186 --> 00:16:54,307
If I'm going to search it or scan it, I would need it digitally anyway.

149
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:56,110
Ms.

150
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:56,530
Vanden Heuvel.

151
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:59,993
I guess I have a concern because I haven't seen this.

152
00:17:00,614 --> 00:17:07,980
And I don't feel like there's, we've been doing it this way for many, many, many, many years.

153
00:17:08,901 --> 00:17:10,021
Perhaps it's a good thing.

154
00:17:10,442 --> 00:17:15,866
But I believe that I want to understand what exactly we would see.

155
00:17:15,886 --> 00:17:19,809
I wouldn't want anybody's confidential information now coming to us.

156
00:17:19,909 --> 00:17:20,910
So I'm very concerned.

157
00:17:21,451 --> 00:17:25,114
So I'm going to table this until our next school committee meeting.

158
00:17:26,095 --> 00:17:28,597
There's a motion on the floor to table, which takes priority.

159
00:17:28,917 --> 00:17:30,599
Is there a second on the motion?

160
00:17:31,439 --> 00:17:31,819
Second.

161
00:17:33,481 --> 00:17:35,182
All those in favor of tabling the paper?

162
00:17:35,202 --> 00:17:36,543
Aye.

163
00:17:36,883 --> 00:17:37,764
All those in favor?

164
00:17:38,885 --> 00:17:38,985
Aye.

165
00:17:40,066 --> 00:17:40,867
All those opposed?

166
00:17:41,467 --> 00:17:41,567
Aye.

167
00:17:42,788 --> 00:17:43,068
Roll call.

168
00:17:43,088 --> 00:17:44,289
The chair is in doubt.

169
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:48,152
Roll call vote on tabling the paper.

170
00:17:48,172 --> 00:17:48,212
OK.

171
00:17:50,057 --> 00:17:51,138
Mrs. DiBenedetto.

172
00:17:51,378 --> 00:17:51,778
No.

173
00:17:53,059 --> 00:17:53,539
Mrs. Fenton.

174
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,139
Yes.

175
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:55,140
Mrs. Stone.

176
00:17:56,621 --> 00:17:56,801
No.

177
00:17:56,841 --> 00:17:57,321
Mr. Durden.

178
00:17:57,361 --> 00:17:57,641
No.

179
00:17:58,822 --> 00:17:58,982
Mr. Russo.

180
00:17:59,022 --> 00:17:59,162
Yes.

181
00:17:59,202 --> 00:17:59,983
Mrs. Kennedy.

182
00:18:01,944 --> 00:18:02,204
Yes.

183
00:18:02,224 --> 00:18:03,325
Mr. Bamford.

184
00:18:03,525 --> 00:18:03,805
Yes.

185
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:10,209
In a vote of three in the affirmative, four in the negative, I'm sorry, four in the affirmative, three in the negative, the motion is tabled.

186
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:12,630
Report of secretary.

187
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:13,831
Oh, yes, I have.

188
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:20,753
with the committee regarding the expenditure report.

189
00:18:21,573 --> 00:18:27,537
When you see the vendor name, WB Mason, the line item description only references telephones.

190
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:30,719
However, the function code represents other expense.

191
00:18:31,339 --> 00:18:40,025
A review of all account structures and descriptors will take place over the summer with the finance director and city auditor to update as needed.

192
00:18:40,465 --> 00:18:46,569
Going forward, this won't be an issue for WB Mason when you see telephones, which you might see it

193
00:18:46,987 --> 00:18:53,289
Right now on the report on page five of nine, you'll see telephones going forward.

194
00:18:53,369 --> 00:19:03,491
It will show up as telephone other expenditures, but this is just one of the items that is, you know, um, one of the fixes that they're going to be doing with the descriptor updates over the summer.

195
00:19:04,091 --> 00:19:08,192
Um, and currently the auditor and the finance director actually corrected that one.

196
00:19:08,712 --> 00:19:10,533
Um, so I just wanted to point that out.

197
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:16,014
And, um, during the month of February I signed batches for invoices related to heating, electricity,

198
00:19:16,579 --> 00:19:22,263
pupil transportation, educational supplies, piano tuning and repairs.

199
00:19:22,303 --> 00:19:29,948
That was something that caught my eye, Paulette and Paul, because we were at the concert and we kind of heard that the tune, the piano needed a tune up, so I wanted to mention that.

200
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:31,369
I saw the invoice and I signed it.

201
00:19:31,809 --> 00:19:35,872
So, yep, and many more, many, many more, so just wanted to share that.

202
00:19:36,838 --> 00:19:37,598
Okay, thank you.

203
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:41,200
Is there a motion on the floor to accept the report and place it on file?

204
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,300
So moved by Ms.

205
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:42,800
Van de Kloet.

206
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:43,660
Is there a second?

207
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,581
Second.

208
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:45,041
By Ms.

209
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:45,681
Mustone.

210
00:19:45,721 --> 00:19:46,361
All those in favor?

211
00:19:46,381 --> 00:19:46,441
Aye.

212
00:19:47,282 --> 00:19:48,022
All those opposed?

213
00:19:48,182 --> 00:19:48,862
Motion passes.

214
00:19:49,923 --> 00:19:51,183
Community participation.

215
00:19:51,203 --> 00:19:51,243
Ms.

216
00:19:51,603 --> 00:19:53,804
Melanie McLaughlin, CPAC presentation.

217
00:20:04,265 --> 00:20:11,350
Hello, thank you, Melanie McLaughlin, Austin Street in Medford, and co-chair Tanya Sullivan for Medford CPAC.

218
00:20:12,331 --> 00:20:13,712
Thanks for hearing us out tonight.

219
00:20:14,572 --> 00:20:20,236
First, we wanted to just sort of share what the Medford CPAC directive is, so folks who are watching tonight know.

220
00:20:23,078 --> 00:20:26,300
The CPAC's purpose is to fill the directive stated in Chapter 71B.

221
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:36,856
of the Massachusetts General Laws, which requires school districts to establish a Parent Advisory Council and assign both an advisory and participatory function to the PAC.

222
00:20:37,696 --> 00:20:42,219
In meeting this requirement, the mission of the Medford Special Education Parent Advisory Council is to

223
00:20:43,039 --> 00:21:02,948
advise the district on matters that pertain to the education and safety of students with disabilities by seeking input from the special education parent members, meet regularly with school officials, participate in the planning, development, and evaluation of the school district's special education programs, participate in planning workshops and activities as prioritized by the CPAC board.

224
00:21:03,789 --> 00:21:04,809
So that's our directive.

225
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:12,413
We want to first start tonight with saying thank you for all of the responses from committee members this past week.

226
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:16,773
who emailed us or called us, and any responses to questions that we had.

227
00:21:18,034 --> 00:21:22,458
We also noticed that you're honoring or thanking Mr. Petrales tonight for the camp.

228
00:21:22,578 --> 00:21:26,381
And personally, my daughter attended the camp last week, and it was really great.

229
00:21:26,441 --> 00:21:27,882
He did a great job, so we're happy.

230
00:21:28,894 --> 00:21:44,750
To see that that's happening and that it's inclusive as well We met with the Disability Council this week as well to discuss some concerns and also The Recreation Department representative was there and he talked quite a bit about inclusivity in the Recreation Department as well So we're very happy about that

231
00:21:45,552 --> 00:21:46,893
want to say thank you about that too.

232
00:21:49,855 --> 00:22:06,246
We wanted to share that last week that Tanya and I worked on an advisory report and PowerPoint available on our Facebook page and also shared with the school committee members and the mayor having to do with safety protocols in schools, CPAC advisory and CPAC PowerPoint.

233
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:11,770
We also shared that with the Department of Education, elementary and secondary education, our

234
00:22:13,193 --> 00:22:16,796
Joint Committee on Education at the state level and our representatives and senators.

235
00:22:18,338 --> 00:22:21,020
And we spoke with DESE last week.

236
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:26,886
We're happy to report that next week during the Special Education Advisory Council to the commissioner.

237
00:22:28,007 --> 00:22:34,153
We will be working on drafting a letter for recommendations for all schools on safety protocols in our schools, particularly to our population.

238
00:22:34,742 --> 00:22:35,782
which we're very pleased with.

239
00:22:35,942 --> 00:22:40,924
And we also met with our representative this week and are going to be exploring additional issues around that.

240
00:22:40,964 --> 00:22:42,024
So we wanted folks to know.

241
00:22:42,584 --> 00:22:49,547
We have an upcoming meeting a week from this Wednesday, so March 14th, 7 and 9 p.m.

242
00:22:49,827 --> 00:22:51,887
on emergency preparedness in schools.

243
00:22:52,027 --> 00:22:56,249
And we want to make sure that folks know that this is for everyone in the district.

244
00:22:56,309 --> 00:22:57,809
It's an inclusive event.

245
00:22:58,049 --> 00:23:00,150
It is not specific to any incident.

246
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:03,391
It is instead about emergency preparedness in our schools.

247
00:23:03,956 --> 00:23:22,282
We were able to secure so far a DESI emergency preparedness expert, Ann Gilligan, who's going to come and speak with us as part of a panel, the Medford Police Department, Medford Fire Department, and a first responder who deals specifically with ALEC training, which is regarding autism and law enforcement training.

248
00:23:22,743 --> 00:23:26,904
And that first responder has also been doing trainings for mental health and first aid.

249
00:23:27,767 --> 00:23:31,410
So for folks who have mental health needs and first aid concerns, so they'll be a part of the panel.

250
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:48,123
We're respectfully requesting that the school has someone on the panel as well, and hopefully maybe someone from the Disability Council or someone from the city on the panel as well, just to create a positive conversation around some of these needs in our district and across the state.

251
00:23:49,164 --> 00:23:54,708
Also wanted to let folks know that we have elections coming up in May, and in June we typically do

252
00:23:55,495 --> 00:23:59,657
our end of the year PowerPoint presentation, where we present to the school committee.

253
00:24:00,258 --> 00:24:06,641
And also, we give out awards for folks in the community who have demonstrated inclusivity and equity.

254
00:24:07,142 --> 00:24:08,182
So we're looking forward to that.

255
00:24:09,543 --> 00:24:13,645
We have two concerns that we wanted to represent to the school committee.

256
00:24:15,166 --> 00:24:20,629
One is that we requested a subcommittee last year as part of our presentation, our end of year PowerPoint presentation.

257
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:25,312
And it was advised that we join a subcommittee that already existed, a curriculum subcommittee.

258
00:24:25,786 --> 00:24:31,511
Unfortunately, that subcommittee, as far as we know, did not meet, or at least we weren't invited to part of a meeting for a subcommittee.

259
00:24:32,091 --> 00:24:37,756
We respectfully request, once again, that we have a subcommittee regarding special education and high-need students.

260
00:24:37,796 --> 00:24:48,825
So our high-need students population, for those who are unsure, are students who are receiving special education supports and services, students who are economically disadvantaged, and our English learner students.

261
00:24:49,245 --> 00:24:51,987
And as you can imagine, there's intersectionality with all of those.

262
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:55,099
We'd love a subcommittee regarding that.

263
00:24:55,299 --> 00:25:12,162
And then it has been brought to our attention over the past, I don't know, probably a year or more, that there's been some concerns of disciplinary action at the McGlynn Preschool level in terms of inclusivity and activity at the McGlynn Preschool.

264
00:25:12,182 --> 00:25:18,523
We want to ensure that the McGlynn Preschool staff has the appropriate supports in place to be able to attend to students of all needs.

265
00:25:18,643 --> 00:25:21,384
They receive an inclusive preschool learning environment grant.

266
00:25:22,027 --> 00:25:29,368
which requires a minimum of three and not more than five students with disabilities in the classroom.

267
00:25:30,068 --> 00:25:37,910
And some students, we're getting reports of some students spending an extensive amount of time at the principal's office in terms of behavior and discipline.

268
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:41,591
And we wanted to bring that to folks' attention, because that's a concern.

269
00:25:41,611 --> 00:25:48,032
We want to make sure that the McGlynn Preschool has what they need to be inclusive, especially in light of the fact that they're receiving a state grant for inclusivity.

270
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,200
And that's it.

271
00:25:51,921 --> 00:25:52,281
Thank you.

272
00:25:52,561 --> 00:25:52,901
All righty.

273
00:25:54,282 --> 00:25:55,082
Thank you very much, Ms.

274
00:25:55,142 --> 00:25:55,602
McLaughlin.

275
00:25:55,702 --> 00:25:59,324
She has requested that a paper be sent to the Curriculum Subcommittee, which Ms.

276
00:25:59,344 --> 00:26:00,744
DiBenedetto is chairing this year.

277
00:26:00,764 --> 00:26:00,824
Yes.

278
00:26:01,985 --> 00:26:02,145
Ms.

279
00:26:02,165 --> 00:26:02,745
Vanderkle.

280
00:26:03,225 --> 00:26:08,608
So first, I know that you guys did a lot of work over the past weekends, and I appreciate that.

281
00:26:10,008 --> 00:26:12,089
I am a little concerned, whatever,

282
00:26:15,155 --> 00:26:20,681
school committee last week also voted that we wanted to set up a parent advisory committee on security.

283
00:26:21,001 --> 00:26:26,166
So I want to make sure that we're working, that your group is working in tandem with that.

284
00:26:26,466 --> 00:26:29,429
I don't think we've yet appointed anybody, but I just want to make sure.

285
00:26:29,449 --> 00:26:29,890
I mean, if

286
00:26:30,438 --> 00:26:32,420
We did have any idea who was going to be on that.

287
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:35,642
It would sure make sense for them to attend next Wednesday.

288
00:26:36,243 --> 00:26:41,807
Melanie, I do need, as the former curriculum, I do want to point out that you and I had talked many times.

289
00:26:42,248 --> 00:26:44,710
And it was really tough to schedule a meeting.

290
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:47,792
And we have emails where back and forth.

291
00:26:47,892 --> 00:26:55,538
So I think that we should go ahead now and send it to the curriculum committee again, which now Erin is the head of it.

292
00:26:55,939 --> 00:26:57,340
And maybe we'll have better luck this year.

293
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:58,961
But I just need to say in

294
00:27:00,522 --> 00:27:03,705
You and I talked many times, and I could show you those e-mails, too.

295
00:27:04,345 --> 00:27:04,605
Okay?

296
00:27:05,906 --> 00:27:06,206
Thank you.

297
00:27:06,226 --> 00:27:12,591
I don't think we need to see the e-mails, but I do appreciate your response, and it's just that it's been almost a year, so we're very concerned.

298
00:27:12,871 --> 00:27:14,472
We requested it last January.

299
00:27:16,674 --> 00:27:17,334
Thank you very much.

300
00:27:17,674 --> 00:27:24,799
On the motion that this paper be sent to subcommittee, I'll... Mr. Benedetto.

301
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:25,320
Thank you.

302
00:27:26,412 --> 00:27:29,933
First of all, I don't think that this should be joined to another committee.

303
00:27:29,973 --> 00:27:39,797
I'm happy to work on this, but I think that this issue, and I'm not sure we could have already voted on that, and I'm not remembering at this moment.

304
00:27:39,897 --> 00:27:52,902
Well, we had respectfully requested that it be a separate committee, but we were told that there was so many committees that we had to go under another committee, and that was part of our concern is that we actually do feel that it should be a distinct committee.

305
00:27:54,111 --> 00:28:06,057
So I'd like to make a motion for this to be a separate committee because curriculum is already a big K through 12 curriculum is a very vast subject area and so is this.

306
00:28:06,377 --> 00:28:13,881
And I don't want either to get overwhelmed by the other or maybe that's not correct word, but you know, it's been a long week.

307
00:28:14,501 --> 00:28:19,223
Um, so I just want to make sure both areas get the attention that they deserve.

308
00:28:19,663 --> 00:28:20,464
And, um,

309
00:28:22,306 --> 00:28:27,149
Parts of what you're asking for does relate to curriculum, but not all of it.

310
00:28:27,329 --> 00:28:27,749
Correct.

311
00:28:28,169 --> 00:28:30,931
So I'm not sure that that's appropriate.

312
00:28:30,951 --> 00:28:35,954
So I'd like to make a motion at this point to add a special committee for this.

313
00:28:36,674 --> 00:28:43,318
And we have a new committee, a new school committee, since January.

314
00:28:43,378 --> 00:28:48,580
So I think these members have a right to weigh in on what their opinion is on this.

315
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:50,782
I'll second it.

316
00:28:50,802 --> 00:28:51,322
Any other questions?

317
00:28:51,887 --> 00:28:56,251
I actually concur because I saw the difficulty in trying to do it as a curriculum.

318
00:28:56,511 --> 00:29:07,579
The reason why we didn't just remind people was because there's six of us and we each have one subcommittee and then I think in the past it was, well, everybody wanted to be on that subcommittee.

319
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:17,507
We've now already had differentiated with a subcommittee for selection committee, so I actually think that doing a separate committee makes a lot of sense.

320
00:29:20,246 --> 00:29:22,348
I just wanted to present that motion before.

321
00:29:22,788 --> 00:29:24,769
Mary member.

322
00:29:24,869 --> 00:29:26,691
Are there any members that would like to serve on this?

323
00:29:27,671 --> 00:29:28,312
Mr. Russo.

324
00:29:28,332 --> 00:29:29,032
Oh, goodness.

325
00:29:29,132 --> 00:29:29,433
Okay.

326
00:29:30,834 --> 00:29:31,714
That's the problem.

327
00:29:31,774 --> 00:29:34,116
Now let's pull out the people that are on the search committee.

328
00:29:34,136 --> 00:29:34,877
Okay.

329
00:29:34,937 --> 00:29:36,157
That takes care of you too.

330
00:29:36,778 --> 00:29:37,759
One, two, three.

331
00:29:38,579 --> 00:29:38,859
Okay.

332
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:39,760
Aaron.

333
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:39,820
No.

334
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:40,601
Oh yeah.

335
00:29:40,621 --> 00:29:41,121
I'm sorry.

336
00:29:42,021 --> 00:29:45,004
All right, we will pick three and let you know.

337
00:29:45,245 --> 00:29:45,885
Thank you very much.

338
00:29:46,186 --> 00:29:46,907
Thank you very much.

339
00:29:47,047 --> 00:29:50,811
On the motion this be sent to the subcommittee on special education.

340
00:29:51,231 --> 00:29:51,932
All those in favor?

341
00:29:52,072 --> 00:29:52,432
Aye.

342
00:29:52,693 --> 00:29:53,353
All those opposed?

343
00:29:53,934 --> 00:29:54,535
Motion passes.

344
00:29:59,713 --> 00:30:06,335
Miss Kretz, would you like to make a motion to suspend the rules so that we could have an individual come forward that you recommended for?

345
00:30:06,355 --> 00:30:06,415
Yes.

346
00:30:06,475 --> 00:30:06,755
Yes.

347
00:30:07,076 --> 00:30:13,738
I'd like to suspend the rules to have Anthony get the first paper on the new business.

348
00:30:13,818 --> 00:30:13,998
Yes.

349
00:30:14,138 --> 00:30:14,378
Oh, OK.

350
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:14,518
Sure.

351
00:30:14,538 --> 00:30:16,979
There's a motion on the floor for suspension of the rules.

352
00:30:17,059 --> 00:30:17,799
Is there a second?

353
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:18,219
Second.

354
00:30:18,239 --> 00:30:19,640
Motion to include.

355
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,320
All those in favor?

356
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:20,840
Aye.

357
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:21,640
All those opposed?

358
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:22,741
Suspension is granted.

359
00:30:23,261 --> 00:30:29,203
New business, be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere gratitude to elementary teacher Anthony Petrellis

360
00:30:29,863 --> 00:30:33,164
on his handling of the children at the February vacation camp last week.

361
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:35,024
Mr. Petralos, could you come forward, please?

362
00:30:36,144 --> 00:30:36,304
Ms.

363
00:30:36,324 --> 00:30:38,545
Kretz, would you like to speak on his behalf?

364
00:30:38,605 --> 00:30:38,865
Yes.

365
00:30:43,385 --> 00:30:43,705
Welcome.

366
00:30:44,446 --> 00:30:44,826
Thank you.

367
00:30:45,226 --> 00:30:45,926
Hello, Anthony.

368
00:30:45,966 --> 00:30:46,246
Hi.

369
00:30:46,546 --> 00:30:48,726
Thank you for coming this evening.

370
00:30:48,906 --> 00:30:55,368
I sent a special message to Mayor Park because I received a message from a parent who was very gracious for everything that you did last week.

371
00:30:55,788 --> 00:30:58,068
And I'll just read the email that I got.

372
00:30:58,828 --> 00:30:59,929
Good evening, Mrs. Kretz.

373
00:31:00,049 --> 00:31:05,752
I wanted to send you something positive from all this mess that's since been unfolding.

374
00:31:06,152 --> 00:31:12,176
As you know, the high school was the home of February Camp and also was swept yesterday as it was filled with the campers.

375
00:31:12,596 --> 00:31:15,437
I would really like to give a huge shout out to Anthony Petrellis.

376
00:31:15,858 --> 00:31:19,840
My son is working as a counselor this week with Anthony.

377
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:22,001
He's a 10th grader at the high school.

378
00:31:22,461 --> 00:31:26,984
Anthony was informed shortly before the sweep was happening and he quickly got a plan together

379
00:31:27,357 --> 00:31:29,198
and met with counselors to have a game plan.

380
00:31:29,758 --> 00:31:34,540
They kept these kids extra busy and occupied them in multiple activities during the process.

381
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:41,322
Her son, not going to mention names, said most of the kids had no idea what was going on because of the plan Anthony came up with.

382
00:31:41,802 --> 00:31:45,484
He said the few that did know were minimally scared or nervous.

383
00:31:45,964 --> 00:31:49,886
Just wanted Anthony to get some credit for what could have been a huge disaster.

384
00:31:50,426 --> 00:31:56,388
I feel because explaining to younger children what the difference between precautions is and when they see dogs and multiple cops,

385
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,201
in cop cars, well, you get what I'm saying.

386
00:32:00,202 --> 00:32:08,247
So Anthony, I just want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for doing such a great job at the camp with all the kids and keeping everything under control.

387
00:32:08,307 --> 00:32:11,749
And I know my son has worked with you over the summer.

388
00:32:11,889 --> 00:32:14,190
And you're just an incredible counselor.

389
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:16,251
And the way that you handle kids is incredible.

390
00:32:16,331 --> 00:32:19,213
And it's a very difficult job.

391
00:32:19,253 --> 00:32:20,794
And you do it extremely well.

392
00:32:20,994 --> 00:32:22,355
And I want to thank you very, very much.

393
00:32:23,231 --> 00:32:27,515
Thank you I'd you know, it wasn't just me too.

394
00:32:27,575 --> 00:32:45,771
I mean it it goes back to you know, my boss Bobby and Rachel Lee, you know athletic directors this athletic director of all of us kind of coming together and you know I just want to recognize to my counsels and Pat Hurley Hannah O'Brien Nick Carlino Bobby Norton Adriana Boboza Mariah Munez and Delaney Tivenin They all were awesome.

395
00:32:45,972 --> 00:32:46,232
You know, I

396
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:49,503
We came up with a plan, but they're the one who really kind of executed it.

397
00:32:49,523 --> 00:32:51,705
So I want to give them most of the credit there.

398
00:32:52,306 --> 00:32:52,866
It's all of us.

399
00:32:52,906 --> 00:32:54,048
So thank you.

400
00:32:54,068 --> 00:32:55,349
I appreciate that very much.

401
00:32:55,449 --> 00:33:00,274
And yeah, I'm glad that everyone was safe and everything was OK.

402
00:33:00,314 --> 00:33:00,835
So thank you.

403
00:33:01,476 --> 00:33:03,418
And thank you, everybody else who helped out.

404
00:33:03,698 --> 00:33:04,759
We really appreciate it.

405
00:33:04,959 --> 00:33:05,640
Thank you very much.

406
00:33:06,121 --> 00:33:06,761
Thank you so much.

407
00:33:06,962 --> 00:33:07,262
Thank you.

408
00:33:14,348 --> 00:33:17,571
On the motion that this item be received and placed on file.

409
00:33:19,592 --> 00:33:20,253
Mr. Benedetto.

410
00:33:20,293 --> 00:33:20,813
I'm sorry.

411
00:33:21,074 --> 00:33:21,454
Thank you.

412
00:33:21,734 --> 00:33:31,002
Um, I just wanted to say thank you to Anthony and all, all the people in the schools recently keeping our children safe and moving forward.

413
00:33:31,602 --> 00:33:35,005
Um, I also would like to know like more about the camp.

414
00:33:35,045 --> 00:33:41,350
So that way other people in the community know about it, how many kids attended, how's it advertised, what the cost is.

415
00:33:41,868 --> 00:33:46,833
I'd like to see the breakdown of the financials of these camps, so that way maybe we could offer more.

416
00:33:47,193 --> 00:33:58,244
So I'm going to ask for a motion to see the financials on these extracurricular programs that we run, so that way we can look at our budget and make more opportunities.

417
00:33:58,424 --> 00:34:00,586
So there's a motion on the floor as well.

418
00:34:01,387 --> 00:34:01,447
OK.

419
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:03,208
Um, yeah, sure.

420
00:34:03,568 --> 00:34:04,468
We can get a copy of that.

421
00:34:04,528 --> 00:34:05,969
I'm not really the person in charge of that.

422
00:34:05,989 --> 00:34:06,769
No, that wouldn't be.

423
00:34:07,189 --> 00:34:09,530
Um, but you know, it's advertised through the schools.

424
00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:11,831
So basically, you know, a flyer will go out.

425
00:34:12,191 --> 00:34:17,334
I think we put it out right after the new year to all the schools and every class and every kid receives them.

426
00:34:17,374 --> 00:34:17,494
So

427
00:34:18,034 --> 00:34:21,676
I'm able to get somebody from every school to kind of hand them out, put them in the teacher's mailboxes.

428
00:34:21,737 --> 00:34:25,139
And most of their registration forms are handed in prior to camp.

429
00:34:25,859 --> 00:34:33,625
Anybody who comes the day of the sign-up, we basically take the information down, put it on a spreadsheet so we have contact information, name, address, and so on.

430
00:34:33,665 --> 00:34:37,127
And usually, Monday is kind of the beginning of it.

431
00:34:37,587 --> 00:34:39,769
You never know what you're going to get or how many walk-ins come in.

432
00:34:39,789 --> 00:34:43,671
But we always put a few extra bodies on to kind of anticipate that.

433
00:34:43,691 --> 00:34:46,193
How many students did you have participate?

434
00:34:46,395 --> 00:34:49,417
So we had 55 who preregistered, I believe.

435
00:34:49,477 --> 00:34:52,358
And I want to say we probably had about another 10 or 15.

436
00:34:52,418 --> 00:34:53,119
I could be wrong.

437
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:54,639
I mean, it's somewhere around there.

438
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:58,161
But I know we were close to 70, about 70, somewhere around there, yeah.

439
00:34:58,421 --> 00:34:58,762
That's great.

440
00:34:58,782 --> 00:34:59,602
Is this your first February?

441
00:35:00,403 --> 00:35:03,424
No, we've been doing this for about 10 years, I would say.

442
00:35:03,484 --> 00:35:07,546
Yeah, I mean, when it first started off, we were maybe lucky to crack double digits.

443
00:35:08,347 --> 00:35:10,588
So it's kind of grown a lot over the years.

444
00:35:10,628 --> 00:35:13,870
I think the summer camp has a lot to play with that as well.

445
00:35:14,495 --> 00:35:27,964
I also think that parents working, it's a great thing that we can offer, and that's why I wanted the financers to make sure that we're giving it to as many students as we can, especially if they feel like they can't afford it.

446
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:32,747
But if we know what the financials of the program are, we can do some.

447
00:35:33,972 --> 00:35:38,695
help, financial help to families that we might think would benefit from coming.

448
00:35:39,356 --> 00:35:41,157
Do you know what the cost is for the camp?

449
00:35:41,277 --> 00:35:43,639
So for vacation camps, there are typically $125 for the week.

450
00:35:43,659 --> 00:35:44,039
That's amazing.

451
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:44,839
That includes breakfast.

452
00:35:48,269 --> 00:35:49,730
During the summer, it's a little bit more.

453
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:54,953
It's $145 a week, but that includes breakfast every day and also includes pizza on Fridays.

454
00:35:56,194 --> 00:36:04,258
And it includes, you know, some sort of indoor, something that comes to us on site during the week as well, usually like a Wednesday or a Thursday.

455
00:36:04,799 --> 00:36:06,059
Mayor Burke, if I could continue.

456
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:07,380
Thank you.

457
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:13,624
I think the programs are so beneficial to our families and our community, and I appreciate you running these year after year.

458
00:36:14,617 --> 00:36:17,998
Do parents sign up through community schools, or is it handled differently?

459
00:36:18,278 --> 00:36:20,159
And that might be not a question for you.

460
00:36:20,539 --> 00:36:27,821
It might be a question to either deputy superintendent or for Kirsten, our financial person, of how we handle this.

461
00:36:27,841 --> 00:36:32,843
Because I want to make sure we give this opportunity to as many students in the community

462
00:36:33,237 --> 00:36:36,880
or families in the community that we can, even if we have to subsidize in some way.

463
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:41,603
Yeah, usually it's, I know it's ran through community schools and it's posted on the Meffitt website.

464
00:36:41,663 --> 00:36:45,105
So it's usually one of the links, one of the first links on there when we put it out.

465
00:36:45,505 --> 00:36:52,370
And as I said, for the same for vacation and summer, when we get the information together, we send it out to all the schools immediately.

466
00:36:53,871 --> 00:36:56,573
You know, and usually the beginning of the summer, it's a little bit slower.

467
00:36:56,793 --> 00:36:58,514
I think, you know, families kind of go away.

468
00:36:58,534 --> 00:37:02,157
And then after that 4th of July is typically when it really starts to pick up.

469
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:11,056
So to you Mayor Burke, would this be moving under the recreation person or would it stay under community schools?

470
00:37:11,176 --> 00:37:13,998
Yeah, I'm just curious as to how these things are going to work.

471
00:37:14,018 --> 00:37:20,782
We'll work collaboratively over programming because we don't want to take away from Anthony and the community schools program.

472
00:37:20,962 --> 00:37:24,525
We're trying to augment programming, so certainly this will stay intact.

473
00:37:24,863 --> 00:37:34,031
So I'd like to make a motion to review these programs and see how, you know, make sure they're in the black and if they are, how we can help benefit families.

474
00:37:34,751 --> 00:37:43,579
This program, as well as any like programs similar to this, I don't know exactly the whole list of them, but I want to make sure we open up opportunities to more families.

475
00:37:43,639 --> 00:37:49,183
So there's a motion on the floor to have all of these, maybe the whole account for community schools.

476
00:37:49,263 --> 00:37:51,265
I know that's coming before us at the end of the month,

477
00:37:51,625 --> 00:38:03,874
But if they could break down these type of things within it, so we can really give like, you know, a school social worker in adjustment counselors might know families that could benefit from this.

478
00:38:03,934 --> 00:38:07,136
And if we know we have the staff already in place.

479
00:38:07,761 --> 00:38:11,902
that we can work with them and get them in there if we're already paying staff.

480
00:38:13,123 --> 00:38:15,063
We do try to assist different schools.

481
00:38:15,263 --> 00:38:20,925
We do get in touch with the principals and see if there's families that are in need and what we can do to try to help out and so on.

482
00:38:20,985 --> 00:38:23,986
So yeah, there's definitely a process as far as that goes.

483
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:43,519
Yeah, I mean anything to help anybody else is obviously beneficial to so I'm asking for the the review of the I think it's 362 account the community schools account to be presented to the school committee so we could see these types of Programming that we're offering Mr.. Russo Thank you.

484
00:38:43,959 --> 00:38:47,061
Is there any capacity issues, or I?

485
00:38:47,081 --> 00:38:49,342
Mean you you don't turning any you know turning anybody away.

486
00:38:49,362 --> 00:38:49,382
I

487
00:38:49,802 --> 00:38:50,082
No.

488
00:38:50,663 --> 00:38:55,967
I mean, we used to be at the Columbus School, and I think our program got so big that we had to move to a bigger site.

489
00:38:55,987 --> 00:38:57,649
So I mean, that's the positive behind that.

490
00:38:58,329 --> 00:39:05,135
But as far as capacity, no, we've never shut it off to any person saying, oh, we're at capacity, or we're at limit for anything.

491
00:39:05,175 --> 00:39:11,660
We just try to hire more people if that was the case, to kind of have a better student, person, and teacher ratio, counselor ratio.

492
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:12,601
Thank you.

493
00:39:12,741 --> 00:39:12,941
Yeah.

494
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:13,762
Ms.

495
00:39:13,862 --> 00:39:14,222
Vandekloot.

496
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:17,071
Anthony, thanks for your good work last week.

497
00:39:17,091 --> 00:39:18,071
We really appreciate it.

498
00:39:18,591 --> 00:39:20,812
We didn't expect anything less from you, though.

499
00:39:20,872 --> 00:39:21,192
Thank you.

500
00:39:21,232 --> 00:39:22,013
Thank you so much.

501
00:39:22,873 --> 00:39:27,755
In terms of the vacation week camps, are we doing another one in April?

502
00:39:27,815 --> 00:39:30,456
I'm not too sure.

503
00:39:31,216 --> 00:39:34,617
I do like to take a week off because I do work the entire summer, too.

504
00:39:35,638 --> 00:39:38,839
So I'm not too sure to answer that question right now.

505
00:39:38,999 --> 00:39:41,560
I'll know shortly whether I'll do it or not.

506
00:39:43,484 --> 00:39:50,350
Last year was the first April vacation I didn't do in 10 years, just because I wanted to enjoy my time off a little bit.

507
00:39:50,490 --> 00:40:00,058
I certainly understand that, but it may be that we should look at to see if there's someone else who could do it, since it does fulfill a need in our community at this point.

508
00:40:01,239 --> 00:40:06,844
And I was curious, during the winter February vacation, did the students use the pool?

509
00:40:07,769 --> 00:40:10,330
No, typically during the vacation camps we don't use the pool.

510
00:40:11,431 --> 00:40:12,331
We never really have.

511
00:40:12,711 --> 00:40:17,653
During the summer we use it full time, but some it's so cold outside sometimes.

512
00:40:17,693 --> 00:40:26,757
I mean we were lucky this February break we had a couple 60 degree days, but typically we're out in the snow sledding down the hills in February, so it was a little different this February with warm weather.

513
00:40:27,117 --> 00:40:28,198
Okay, thanks very much.

514
00:40:28,218 --> 00:40:28,858
Yeah, of course.

515
00:40:29,318 --> 00:40:29,738
Thank you.

516
00:40:29,758 --> 00:40:36,083
There's a motion on the floor to request the finances for the summer February camp program.

517
00:40:36,423 --> 00:40:37,324
There's a motion.

518
00:40:38,225 --> 00:40:38,785
Is there a second?

519
00:40:39,826 --> 00:40:40,787
Mr. Russo, question.

520
00:40:42,428 --> 00:40:44,850
These are finances that are just part of the school system, right?

521
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:45,290
Yes.

522
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:47,331
Anthony's not going to be- It's a program.

523
00:40:47,351 --> 00:40:47,892
Okay, thank you.

524
00:40:48,312 --> 00:40:50,213
Christine can whip it out pretty quickly.

525
00:40:50,653 --> 00:40:52,354
It actually goes through community schools.

526
00:40:52,414 --> 00:41:02,120
If it could be presented with the community schools budget that's coming before us, I think by the end of this month, is what my team are asking.

527
00:41:03,591 --> 00:41:08,833
I'd be happy with that in a breakdown of the different programs in that fashion.

528
00:41:09,033 --> 00:41:11,473
On the motion as seconded by Mr. Russo.

529
00:41:12,154 --> 00:41:13,314
All those in favor?

530
00:41:13,334 --> 00:41:13,394
Aye.

531
00:41:13,634 --> 00:41:14,334
All those opposed?

532
00:41:14,554 --> 00:41:15,255
Motion passes.

533
00:41:15,595 --> 00:41:16,235
Thank you, Anthony.

534
00:41:16,255 --> 00:41:20,876
Is there a motion to revert to the regular order of business by Ms.

535
00:41:20,956 --> 00:41:22,497
Kretz, seconded by Mr. Ruggiero?

536
00:41:23,377 --> 00:41:26,398
Report on elementary response to intervention.

537
00:41:31,179 --> 00:41:31,620
Good evening.

538
00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:34,700
Burke, members of the school committee.

539
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:43,943
Diane Caldwell, our assistant superintendent, has prepared a report to update the committee on the implementation of RTI.

540
00:41:43,963 --> 00:41:46,324
This is a very important initiative.

541
00:41:46,364 --> 00:41:47,685
A lot of progress has been done.

542
00:41:47,725 --> 00:41:50,426
A lot of work has been done by Diane and the teachers.

543
00:41:51,106 --> 00:41:54,868
And again, Diane, if you want to share the progress to date and plans moving forward.

544
00:41:55,208 --> 00:41:55,348
Ms.

545
00:41:55,388 --> 00:41:55,548
Caldwell.

546
00:41:55,568 --> 00:41:56,088
Thank you.

547
00:41:57,368 --> 00:41:58,269
Good evening, everyone.

548
00:41:59,194 --> 00:42:04,739
So as you know, we've been working hard implementing RTI in grade one.

549
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:11,684
We have different scenarios for response to intervention at the various schools.

550
00:42:12,385 --> 00:42:25,816
Some schools are doing it full force, all in, everyone in grade one is doing it, and some title one teachers are doing it, and in other buildings, it's just the literacy teachers as well as the grade one teachers.

551
00:42:27,263 --> 00:42:43,832
We actually are piloting an assessment tool called Renaissance Star Literacy, but our teachers are also using the DRA, Fountas-Pinell, Words Their Way, and of course, teacher recommendation to see what students might need some extra help.

552
00:42:45,013 --> 00:42:48,195
We have provided professional development in Renaissance.

553
00:42:48,255 --> 00:42:53,317
We did that in October with our grade one teachers and literacy specialists at the high school.

554
00:42:53,798 --> 00:42:55,619
We met for about three to five hours.

555
00:42:57,141 --> 00:43:00,844
because we want to take a look closely at this to see if this meets our needs.

556
00:43:01,966 --> 00:43:08,832
In addition, we have provided professional development in response to intervention through Teachers 21.

557
00:43:09,353 --> 00:43:10,654
That was done in November.

558
00:43:11,395 --> 00:43:19,123
We had hoped to do some more professional development in March, but as you know, we had to change our March Professional Development Day.

559
00:43:20,309 --> 00:43:30,975
One of the wonderful things that we did was had our principals go to Burlington Public Schools, and they met with Susan Stone in Burlington, who is the RTI coordinator.

560
00:43:31,635 --> 00:43:38,579
And she walked our principals and assistant principals through what RTI really looks like in their buildings.

561
00:43:39,259 --> 00:43:48,804
So they've been doing this for about 10 years, and it takes a lot of time to really become knowledgeable about the best way to implement it in your district.

562
00:43:49,962 --> 00:43:54,423
Our Title I and literacy staff have been assisting our first grade teachers in RTI.

563
00:43:55,484 --> 00:44:02,345
I have shown you and given to you a clear vision, identified a screening tool, and it was STAR Literacy to get started.

564
00:44:03,086 --> 00:44:10,448
We are progress monitoring our students, so every six to eight weeks we're looking at our children to see what progress is being made.

565
00:44:11,468 --> 00:44:18,470
And we are providing intensive tiers or change in different strategies with our kids.

566
00:44:19,385 --> 00:44:23,288
However, we're only in the beginning stages, so we're still continuing to look at this.

567
00:44:24,169 --> 00:44:35,619
Last week, Dr. Chiesa, myself, the principals, and our grade one staff met to discuss how things are going after a month or so in their rooms.

568
00:44:36,961 --> 00:44:41,705
They're finding Renaissance a difficult tool to utilize, so we have to look more closely at that.

569
00:44:42,535 --> 00:44:52,301
There's a recommendation, perhaps, to use assessment tools that they're familiar with, such as DRA or Fountas-Pinell, in addition to Words Stay Away for next year.

570
00:44:53,262 --> 00:44:59,346
We have to look closely at scheduling because that is an issue, especially if we want to have sustainability with RTI.

571
00:45:00,206 --> 00:45:10,873
If you have specialists push in with each grade level, it may not be sustainable to go one, two, three, four, and five.

572
00:45:12,083 --> 00:45:14,444
We're also looking at specific models.

573
00:45:14,485 --> 00:45:21,469
So we'll take a look at what the Brooks and the Columbus are doing and how it differentiates from what the McGlynn and the Roberts are doing.

574
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:24,951
We're going to look at specific topics.

575
00:45:24,991 --> 00:45:37,419
So for instance, if we're continuing with literacy, which is our plan, do we focus on subjects like phonemic awareness and fluency and comprehension, as opposed to opening up to a variety of different literacy components?

576
00:45:38,515 --> 00:45:43,519
And we're also looking at what grade levels we may be able to move forward with for next year.

577
00:45:44,579 --> 00:45:46,941
Currently, we're just, you know, with grade one.

578
00:45:47,501 --> 00:45:53,246
I'd like to move it into grade two and see how that works, and maybe do full force with grades one and two.

579
00:45:54,286 --> 00:46:00,571
Dr. Nicole Chiesa, principals, grade one staff, and I did meet to debrief about RTI working.

580
00:46:00,611 --> 00:46:07,776
We have another meeting planned in April, and hopefully we'll get more information and update you as we move along.

581
00:46:09,103 --> 00:46:10,763
I'd love to answer any questions if you have some.

582
00:46:10,783 --> 00:46:11,384
Mr. Benedetto.

583
00:46:11,824 --> 00:46:12,204
Thank you.

584
00:46:13,204 --> 00:46:16,985
So Diane, when I read your report, a few things stood out to me.

585
00:46:17,405 --> 00:46:31,929
The first one is that because the professional development day has been changed, is there another plan to help these teachers make sure they have the training that they need?

586
00:46:32,550 --> 00:46:34,510
So I have reached out to Teachers 21.

587
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:36,171
I've spoken to Maureen Huddleston.

588
00:46:36,231 --> 00:46:37,491
We are looking into it.

589
00:46:38,489 --> 00:46:47,972
Time is really short for us, and we can provide after school, but I don't have any specific mandated time to do this for this year.

590
00:46:48,392 --> 00:46:50,773
But I have reached out to Teachers 21, yes.

591
00:46:51,193 --> 00:46:56,674
And hopefully they can have a PowerPoint or something that teachers will want to look at, so that way they can implement some of that.

592
00:46:56,694 --> 00:46:58,395
They could, or we could work an afternoon.

593
00:46:59,135 --> 00:47:03,936
So if teachers want to stay maybe a couple of afternoons from like 3 to 5, we could see if we could work that out with them.

594
00:47:04,076 --> 00:47:04,336
OK.

595
00:47:04,717 --> 00:47:06,317
I just would hate for this not

596
00:47:06,593 --> 00:47:09,055
because you've worked very hard on it, and they have too.

597
00:47:09,075 --> 00:47:10,416
The teachers have done a great job.

598
00:47:10,476 --> 00:47:10,676
Right.

599
00:47:11,516 --> 00:47:20,782
The next thing that really stood out to me out of your report was Burlington is fortunate enough to be able to hire several RTI tutors for each building.

600
00:47:21,243 --> 00:47:31,149
Having those tutors assures fidelity to interventions, providing more intensive support and core instruction in E-Line and PD around intervention training.

601
00:47:31,549 --> 00:47:32,110
That's true.

602
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:32,870
I think that's key.

603
00:47:34,345 --> 00:47:42,186
I don't know if you feel like a curriculum meeting towards budget time, we might sit down and talk about this situation.

604
00:47:42,206 --> 00:47:43,767
Or you can just make recommendations.

605
00:47:43,927 --> 00:47:50,548
If we want it to work and we want it to be sustainable, we may have to entertain the idea of having additional tutors.

606
00:47:50,588 --> 00:47:55,329
Now in Burlington, they're very lucky to get retired people to come back.

607
00:47:55,449 --> 00:47:57,949
So that saves their district money.

608
00:47:58,009 --> 00:48:01,230
So we could look into maybe bringing back some retired people.

609
00:48:02,223 --> 00:48:02,984
to work as tutors.

610
00:48:03,604 --> 00:48:08,628
But, yeah, the more you can push in and take small groups of children and work with them, the better we would be.

611
00:48:08,648 --> 00:48:09,589
All right.

612
00:48:09,969 --> 00:48:14,933
So I just want to make sure we're ready for budget time and that, you know, your recommendations.

613
00:48:14,993 --> 00:48:28,322
I know that this was the year that you were going to see how it was working and make recommendations because I know some of us were pushing for our TI teachers for this year, and we said we were piloting this and see how the data brought us.

614
00:48:29,487 --> 00:48:32,349
Do you have an idea of which way you're going to be heading?

615
00:48:32,369 --> 00:48:34,671
Because budgets are starting to be presented tonight.

616
00:48:34,691 --> 00:48:38,034
I just want to make sure that we have a clear vision for next year.

617
00:48:38,134 --> 00:48:42,757
And I'm going to look at you as the expert, seeing what's happened so far.

618
00:48:43,878 --> 00:48:46,940
Well, I'm going to ask for the moon and then see what I get from that.

619
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:52,585
I think that we owe it to our teachers and staff to give them the additional support that they need.

620
00:48:52,645 --> 00:48:58,049
So if I could ask for some additional RTI help in the schools.

621
00:48:58,622 --> 00:48:59,502
I would do that, yes.

622
00:48:59,882 --> 00:49:00,162
Okay.

623
00:49:00,462 --> 00:49:00,803
Thank you.

624
00:49:00,883 --> 00:49:04,923
It's just good to know so that way we're all thinking and preparing for that.

625
00:49:05,164 --> 00:49:05,364
Sure.

626
00:49:05,384 --> 00:49:06,024
Coming forward.

627
00:49:06,144 --> 00:49:06,744
Thank you for your report.

628
00:49:06,824 --> 00:49:07,304
Thank you.

629
00:49:07,664 --> 00:49:08,984
Mr. Russo, you're all set.

630
00:49:10,665 --> 00:49:11,325
Mr. Ruggiero.

631
00:49:12,065 --> 00:49:13,665
Yeah, a couple of questions.

632
00:49:14,086 --> 00:49:19,127
So when you say several RTI tutors, how many are we talking about per building?

633
00:49:19,167 --> 00:49:20,147
Like three or two?

634
00:49:22,055 --> 00:49:32,928
Well, so if we just start with grades one and two for next year, if we had one full-time tutor that we might be able to split between the two grade levels for each building, that would be helpful.

635
00:49:33,048 --> 00:49:33,248
Okay.

636
00:49:35,090 --> 00:49:41,538
And, um, so I have a, this is on page two of the report and you say Renaissance is a difficult tool to utilize.

637
00:49:42,133 --> 00:49:45,254
Do you have sense of what the participation rate is among teachers?

638
00:49:45,374 --> 00:49:48,415
Are teachers using part of it now because it's too difficult?

639
00:49:48,435 --> 00:49:49,916
They're having trouble using it all?

640
00:49:50,036 --> 00:49:53,097
I'm just, what do you mean when you say Renaissance is a difficult tool to use?

641
00:49:53,237 --> 00:49:57,319
It's difficult for the teachers to navigate through Renaissance when they go online.

642
00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:02,181
The children have headphones on as they listen and they do the assessments.

643
00:50:02,921 --> 00:50:04,602
We can't hear what's going on.

644
00:50:04,702 --> 00:50:08,223
So if something's not working in the headphones, we don't even know that.

645
00:50:08,543 --> 00:50:09,083
Oh, I see what you mean.

646
00:50:09,103 --> 00:50:10,604
And the children are filling in blanks.

647
00:50:11,813 --> 00:50:22,341
We've had maybe three professional development sessions, online sessions with Renaissance, and honestly, they haven't been as helpful as I hoped that they would be.

648
00:50:24,382 --> 00:50:24,683
All set?

649
00:50:25,123 --> 00:50:25,603
Yeah, thank you.

650
00:50:25,863 --> 00:50:25,983
Ms.

651
00:50:26,024 --> 00:50:27,625
Van de Kloot.

652
00:50:27,925 --> 00:50:38,212
Diane, I have a relationship with one of the Burlington elementary teachers, and that's what really sparked my interest, our long conversations about this.

653
00:50:38,813 --> 00:50:40,394
And I do know that she said that

654
00:50:41,517 --> 00:50:43,018
The tutors were extremely helpful.

655
00:50:43,198 --> 00:50:51,504
But I also, and I'll check back with her, but I wondered whether, is this something you could, could you train any volunteers?

656
00:50:52,345 --> 00:50:53,546
Or is it too extensive?

657
00:50:54,666 --> 00:50:57,368
I think you might be able to train volunteers to do that.

658
00:50:57,448 --> 00:51:06,895
Currently at the McGlynn Elementary School, we have one of our grade, first grade teachers is utilizing Mystic Valley Elder Services in that capacity.

659
00:51:06,955 --> 00:51:09,737
So yes, I think you could probably train people to do it.

660
00:51:10,430 --> 00:51:18,073
They're using teachers, retired teachers, so we'd have to think about making sure that the kiddos are getting the best.

661
00:51:18,614 --> 00:51:19,314
Right, of course.

662
00:51:20,014 --> 00:51:20,354
Of course.

663
00:51:20,995 --> 00:51:21,315
Thank you.

664
00:51:22,696 --> 00:51:23,076
Very good.

665
00:51:24,857 --> 00:51:25,477
I'm sorry, Ms.

666
00:51:25,517 --> 00:51:25,997
Mustone.

667
00:51:26,017 --> 00:51:28,298
Thank you, Diane.

668
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:30,039
One of the concerns was staffing.

669
00:51:30,159 --> 00:51:34,501
And this is more just, I think, what Erin was saying for us to get a head start on budgeting.

670
00:51:35,061 --> 00:51:39,163
For the four schools, could you just, if you can offhand,

671
00:51:39,593 --> 00:51:46,218
say how many kindergarten classes they have, how many Title I teachers they have, and how many literacy support teachers each school has?

672
00:51:47,439 --> 00:51:53,544
So off the top of my head, each of the schools has four kindergarten teachers.

673
00:51:53,564 --> 00:51:54,825
You said kindergarten, correct?

674
00:51:57,607 --> 00:52:03,171
At the Roberts, they have two Title I teachers and a literacy specialist.

675
00:52:03,391 --> 00:52:04,292
One literacy?

676
00:52:04,632 --> 00:52:05,813
One literacy specialist.

677
00:52:06,593 --> 00:52:13,116
At the McGlynn, they have 2.6 Title I teachers and a literacy specialist.

678
00:52:14,156 --> 00:52:23,881
At the Columbus, they have 3.0 Title I teachers and a .5 literacy specialist.

679
00:52:24,841 --> 00:52:29,163
The Brooks does not qualify for Title I, and they have

680
00:52:31,072 --> 00:52:33,775
3.0 literacy specialists.

681
00:52:34,035 --> 00:52:35,356
So that almost makes up the difference?

682
00:52:35,596 --> 00:52:35,857
Yes.

683
00:52:36,277 --> 00:52:36,577
Okay.

684
00:52:37,598 --> 00:52:48,348
And then with the other options, so the plan is not to pick renaissance this year, but to try the

685
00:52:49,072 --> 00:52:52,334
Fountas, Pinnell, are the words their way next year to pilot?

686
00:52:52,775 --> 00:52:57,799
So I'm leaning towards either Fountas, Pinnell, or DRA 2s.

687
00:52:58,579 --> 00:53:05,224
Our younger elementary grades use DRA 2 and words their way, so they're already familiar with that.

688
00:53:05,985 --> 00:53:11,069
But I would need monies to train our new staff, and I would need materials.

689
00:53:12,430 --> 00:53:16,813
Not for every single teacher, because a lot of teachers already have their DRAs.

690
00:53:17,437 --> 00:53:21,902
Okay, and then the comments, were they from a survey that all the grade one teachers took?

691
00:53:21,922 --> 00:53:23,603
I don't know where the comments came from.

692
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:28,068
Well, the comments came from my meeting when I met with the teachers last Thursday afternoon.

693
00:53:28,605 --> 00:53:31,266
And all the grade one teachers were part of the meeting?

694
00:53:31,626 --> 00:53:32,547
Every single one of them, yes.

695
00:53:32,587 --> 00:53:33,407
Oh, that's great.

696
00:53:33,447 --> 00:53:38,129
And the literacy specialists were there, and the principals were all there, along with Dr. Chiesa.

697
00:53:40,971 --> 00:53:45,793
So we don't have to move yet on Renaissance, because from the comments, it doesn't seem like it's supported by many teachers.

698
00:53:45,813 --> 00:53:51,456
So we bought into Renaissance until August this year, because the grant went from August to August.

699
00:53:52,816 --> 00:53:56,438
So they're still using it, because the teachers said they still want to keep up with it.

700
00:53:56,958 --> 00:53:59,259
And I'll still continue with the professional development.

701
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:06,543
But after, you know, a short amount of time, I can, I can get a feeling from the teachers and we need to make sure it meets their needs.

702
00:54:06,803 --> 00:54:07,524
Okay, great.

703
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:07,924
All right.

704
00:54:08,004 --> 00:54:08,444
Thank you.

705
00:54:08,724 --> 00:54:09,205
You're welcome.

706
00:54:09,445 --> 00:54:09,865
Very good.

707
00:54:10,225 --> 00:54:11,806
Is there a motion to receive this report?

708
00:54:11,846 --> 00:54:14,748
Place it on file by Mr. Ruggiero, seconded by Mr. Russo.

709
00:54:14,828 --> 00:54:15,548
All those in favor?

710
00:54:16,228 --> 00:54:16,989
All those opposed?

711
00:54:17,049 --> 00:54:17,789
Motion passes.

712
00:54:18,470 --> 00:54:22,892
Recommendation for approval of overnight field trip by McGlynn middle school, grade seven.

713
00:54:24,193 --> 00:54:24,333
Ms.

714
00:54:24,373 --> 00:54:24,673
Nelson.

715
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:32,403
The students in grade seven have for many years participated in this environmental camp, which is located in Rhode Island.

716
00:54:32,943 --> 00:54:35,303
We're asking for the committee's approval for the trip.

717
00:54:35,384 --> 00:54:49,328
We realized that we should have perhaps done it earlier, but with the field trip policy changing and the edits and so on, again, we're asking for your permission based on the fact that the trip did get signatures back in January.

718
00:54:49,848 --> 00:54:54,410
I know that Mr. Cieri is here, director of science, who could speak to the

719
00:54:54,793 --> 00:54:56,275
benefits of the trip, and I believe Ms.

720
00:54:56,295 --> 00:54:59,059
Bellini, who helps to organize it, is with them tonight.

721
00:54:59,499 --> 00:55:07,310
So if you'd like to, again, talk about the trip, I believe all medical clearances have been vetted and that you're ready to go if we get approval.

722
00:55:10,163 --> 00:55:10,563
Good evening.

723
00:55:10,583 --> 00:55:13,584
Good evening, Madam Mayor and school committee members.

724
00:55:13,984 --> 00:55:20,365
I'm excited to be able to provide you with a recommendation to approve this overnight field trip.

725
00:55:20,405 --> 00:55:25,646
It's a one night trip to Rhode Island, University of Rhode Island, an environmental trip.

726
00:55:26,286 --> 00:55:26,426
Ms.

727
00:55:26,446 --> 00:55:35,387
Bellini has worked pretty hard putting it together, trying to get all of the sort of back end of the trip prepared with her colleagues in the seventh grade.

728
00:55:36,187 --> 00:55:39,608
And all of the information that you have in front of you has been put together by her.

729
00:55:40,762 --> 00:55:43,925
And we're here just to answer any questions if you have them.

730
00:55:44,366 --> 00:55:45,086
Mr. Benedetto.

731
00:55:45,767 --> 00:55:46,147
Thank you.

732
00:55:47,328 --> 00:55:52,453
I added up all the money and it's $225 for this trip per student.

733
00:55:52,573 --> 00:55:53,434
Is that the right amount?

734
00:55:53,594 --> 00:55:53,834
No.

735
00:55:54,915 --> 00:55:57,097
So because we're going in March, it's a discounted rate.

736
00:55:57,137 --> 00:55:58,078
So it's actually $160 per student.

737
00:55:58,098 --> 00:55:58,138
OK.

738
00:55:58,158 --> 00:56:00,020
So it's $160 per student.

739
00:56:04,710 --> 00:56:10,191
And is there any reduced rate for children on free or reduced lunch, or how do you do that?

740
00:56:10,251 --> 00:56:14,212
How do you know if a family's just struggling to be able to send their child?

741
00:56:14,332 --> 00:56:19,693
So we have some funding that was given to us by Ms.

742
00:56:19,753 --> 00:56:27,594
Liu from fundraising back in November, I believe, with the 5K race that she did.

743
00:56:27,614 --> 00:56:33,235
So we have some funds available to us, but that's kind of our limited supply of

744
00:56:34,416 --> 00:56:38,419
funding to assist with students that need that extra help.

745
00:56:39,499 --> 00:56:41,621
And how would people know that was available to them?

746
00:56:42,722 --> 00:56:46,064
I spoke with all the students individually and mentioned that at the meeting.

747
00:56:46,844 --> 00:56:52,808
And so I told them that if any of them need any financial assistance to please come see myself or Ms.

748
00:56:52,828 --> 00:56:53,329
Haas.

749
00:56:53,829 --> 00:56:55,710
And we've been dealing with the students individually.

750
00:56:57,292 --> 00:56:57,612
Thank you.

751
00:56:58,465 --> 00:56:59,306
Motion to approve.

752
00:56:59,586 --> 00:57:01,067
There's a motion on the floor for approval.

753
00:57:01,087 --> 00:57:03,029
Did you want to speak on this?

754
00:57:03,629 --> 00:57:06,151
Could you please tell me how many students are signed up to go?

755
00:57:06,492 --> 00:57:09,834
Right now we have 72 students, and I think that's the final number.

756
00:57:09,894 --> 00:57:15,219
So I gave them 90 as the basis off of what we had as an attendance last year.

757
00:57:15,239 --> 00:57:19,782
I think last year we had 88 kids going, but this year we have 72.

758
00:57:19,902 --> 00:57:20,002
OK.

759
00:57:20,783 --> 00:57:21,103
Thank you.

760
00:57:21,504 --> 00:57:22,504
I think it's great.

761
00:57:23,205 --> 00:57:23,906
Is there a second?

762
00:57:24,286 --> 00:57:24,626
Second.

763
00:57:25,347 --> 00:57:25,447
OK.

764
00:57:25,667 --> 00:57:26,628
Roll call vote, please.

765
00:57:35,872 --> 00:57:36,092
Yes.

766
00:57:37,272 --> 00:57:39,193
Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

767
00:57:39,253 --> 00:57:39,913
Motion passes.

768
00:57:39,953 --> 00:57:40,334
Have fun.

769
00:57:40,514 --> 00:57:40,994
Thank you.

770
00:57:41,014 --> 00:57:41,794
Thank you.

771
00:57:43,114 --> 00:57:45,575
Also, could someone make a motion for suspension?

772
00:57:45,615 --> 00:57:49,377
We have another field trip for the Medford Vocational Technical High School.

773
00:57:49,397 --> 00:57:52,938
There's a motion for suspension on the floor, seconded by Ms.

774
00:57:52,978 --> 00:57:53,338
Vanden Heuvel.

775
00:57:53,358 --> 00:57:53,998
All those in favor?

776
00:57:54,018 --> 00:57:54,738
All those opposed?

777
00:57:55,339 --> 00:57:55,839
Addendum.

778
00:57:55,879 --> 00:57:57,239
This was added to our agenda.

779
00:57:57,779 --> 00:57:59,960
This request was received after the meeting was posted.

780
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:05,402
However, it was within the 48 hours of the field trip for the Medford Vocational Technical High School.

781
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:08,342
to attend the DACA state competition.

782
00:58:10,844 --> 00:58:11,724
So good evening.

783
00:58:12,145 --> 00:58:12,645
Good evening.

784
00:58:12,665 --> 00:58:27,796
A couple of weeks ago when we were here and the kids got their certificates, we were just going to go in Friday for the competition and then Saturday morning for the awards banquet.

785
00:58:29,197 --> 00:58:30,378
Since that time,

786
00:58:32,076 --> 00:58:43,402
They decided to cost share and fundraise with the funds that Mr. Fallon was able to secure for the registration.

787
00:58:45,464 --> 00:58:58,871
So we have five vocational kids that are going to stay overnight with myself Thursday and Friday.

788
00:59:00,552 --> 00:59:10,198
And the three high schoolers are going to come in Friday just for the day and maybe come back on their own for the awards banquet.

789
00:59:12,119 --> 00:59:19,764
So I just did a quick spreadsheet for you that basically everything is covered so there's no request for funding.

790
00:59:22,406 --> 00:59:28,410
And I also included in there is the liability and the consent forms.

791
00:59:29,387 --> 00:59:34,708
Because those forms are not only signed by the students, but also their parents.

792
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:42,130
And it outlines very clearly level one and level two infractions and what happens.

793
00:59:43,611 --> 00:59:47,412
And I know securities are concerned on everybody's parts these days.

794
00:59:47,532 --> 00:59:58,375
So there's 2,900 advisors and students who are going to occupy 90% of the Marriott rooms.

795
01:00:00,831 --> 01:00:08,937
DECA has their own security force that works in conjunction with the Marriott and the Boston Police Department.

796
01:00:09,977 --> 01:00:12,639
And even they're starting to tighten up things.

797
01:00:12,719 --> 01:00:19,423
So the bags will be checked internally by us before we leave Thursday.

798
01:00:20,444 --> 01:00:25,787
And then they go into a secure area before we move to the rooms.

799
01:00:26,708 --> 01:00:29,650
And the Boston Police Department's going to sweep it with dogs.

800
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:38,272
Mr. Benedetto, thank you for bringing the children to this, and good luck.

801
01:00:38,312 --> 01:00:40,934
I hope they will bring back a lot of awards.

802
01:00:41,474 --> 01:00:47,097
And thank you for making sure that the security measures are implemented and followed.

803
01:00:47,577 --> 01:00:50,679
Have a fun time, and a motion to approve.

804
01:00:51,619 --> 01:00:53,120
Motion on the floor for approval.

805
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:54,281
Seconded by Mr. Ruggiero.

806
01:00:54,301 --> 01:00:55,201
Roll call vote, please.

807
01:00:55,221 --> 01:00:55,541
Mrs. Benedetto.

808
01:00:57,282 --> 01:00:57,482
Yes.

809
01:01:06,506 --> 01:01:08,328
Yes, 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

810
01:01:08,368 --> 01:01:09,208
Motion passes.

811
01:01:09,348 --> 01:01:09,889
Good luck.

812
01:01:10,990 --> 01:01:12,851
Oh, Sebastian, Mr. Tringali.

813
01:01:16,975 --> 01:01:26,923
Yeah, I was just wondering if there's anything the high school community can do, like fundraising, or if it's already more or less the dust is settled.

814
01:01:27,272 --> 01:01:31,994
Hopefully, we're going to ask for some support if we make it to Atlanta.

815
01:01:32,255 --> 01:01:32,555
All right.

816
01:01:32,595 --> 01:01:33,515
Right now, we're all set.

817
01:01:33,535 --> 01:01:35,436
Thank you, though.

818
01:01:37,377 --> 01:01:37,798
Good luck.

819
01:01:37,838 --> 01:01:38,338
Let us know.

820
01:01:39,318 --> 01:01:39,719
Thank you.

821
01:01:39,739 --> 01:01:41,840
Thank you.

822
01:01:42,060 --> 01:01:48,783
While we are under suspension, I wanted to talk about our subcommittee meeting, Mr. Ruggiero.

823
01:01:50,657 --> 01:02:02,940
So typically, we send things to subcommittee meetings, but Mr. Ruggiero has proposed that we have a subcommittee meeting on community outreach this Friday.

824
01:02:03,260 --> 01:02:05,141
And perhaps I could just ask you to talk about it.

825
01:02:06,341 --> 01:02:10,422
I just want to make sure that the rest of the committee knows.

826
01:02:10,442 --> 01:02:14,203
I had asked that there be a preliminary meeting.

827
01:02:14,263 --> 01:02:15,964
Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like timing is.

828
01:02:16,384 --> 01:02:20,325
And Mr. Ruggiero, I just want to mention that it needs to be posted.

829
01:02:21,076 --> 01:02:24,219
And that means you need to contact the superintendent's office to have that happen.

830
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:25,821
Yeah.

831
01:02:25,921 --> 01:02:34,169
Um, so we, we, as the three members of the community relations subcommittee, we all worked out when would be the best time to me.

832
01:02:34,549 --> 01:02:37,892
It's going to be on March 9th from 1230 to one 30.

833
01:02:38,032 --> 01:02:41,936
Um, we cleared the date with the senior center.

834
01:02:42,056 --> 01:02:42,937
So that's where we'll be.

835
01:02:43,398 --> 01:02:45,800
And it'll also just give opportunity for seniors.

836
01:02:46,483 --> 01:02:50,507
that sometimes aren't able to come to our meetings or just have an opportunity to speak.

837
01:02:50,827 --> 01:02:54,271
All the issues were forwarded to the superintendent and to the mayors.

838
01:02:54,351 --> 01:03:00,597
I think maybe just due to the timing of things and what's been going on lately, I think maybe it's been lost in the shuffle.

839
01:03:00,617 --> 01:03:03,099
But I'm going to make sure everything is going to be posted properly.

840
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:06,883
It's also been posted in the senior newspaper that they have.

841
01:03:07,622 --> 01:03:11,804
I just want to make sure we officially post it towards our regulations.

842
01:03:11,824 --> 01:03:17,366
I'm following up with the deputy superintendents to make sure everything is posted properly.

843
01:03:17,946 --> 01:03:20,767
Could you announce what the agenda is for the meeting?

844
01:03:21,047 --> 01:03:21,267
Sure.

845
01:03:21,687 --> 01:03:24,548
So I'm going to be posting the agenda online.

846
01:03:24,749 --> 01:03:26,789
So basically, we're only going to have an hour.

847
01:03:26,809 --> 01:03:28,710
Unfortunately, that's all the time they could give us.

848
01:03:28,790 --> 01:03:36,013
But the primary issue of the day is going to be discussing how we can reach out to our senior community to improve

849
01:03:37,033 --> 01:03:46,899
whether it's through tutoring or maybe through RTI, whatever sort of implementation that we're able to have for the senior community to help out with our education system.

850
01:03:47,139 --> 01:03:49,020
And basically just to hear from what we can do.

851
01:03:50,081 --> 01:03:51,461
All this will be posted officially though.

852
01:03:51,922 --> 01:03:52,062
Okay.

853
01:03:52,142 --> 01:03:57,125
And one of the members will keep the minutes because you're doing it off-site and you need two for a quorum.

854
01:03:58,545 --> 01:03:58,706
Ms.

855
01:03:58,746 --> 01:04:00,046
Mustone is unable to attend.

856
01:04:00,066 --> 01:04:01,087
Yeah, unfortunately.

857
01:04:07,605 --> 01:04:18,716
Okay I'm certainly hoping to be there planning to be there, but you know sometimes I would do work in an environment which can be tricky Thank you for the information

858
01:04:26,950 --> 01:04:29,732
Motion to revert to the regular order of business by Ms.

859
01:04:29,772 --> 01:04:30,653
Kretz, seconded by Ms.

860
01:04:30,833 --> 01:04:31,113
Stone.

861
01:04:31,133 --> 01:04:31,874
All those in favor?

862
01:04:32,594 --> 01:04:33,255
All those opposed?

863
01:04:33,295 --> 01:04:33,995
Motion passes.

864
01:04:34,436 --> 01:04:37,318
Recommendation to approve incident report policy.

865
01:04:38,819 --> 01:04:46,385
At our meeting on February 27th, the proposed new incident report policy was reviewed by the school committee.

866
01:04:47,065 --> 01:04:49,567
Mr. Rousseau recommended an additional edit.

867
01:04:49,587 --> 01:04:53,190
It was a sentence to be added to the draft policy.

868
01:04:53,741 --> 01:05:03,947
And that sentence reads, this policy will be integrated into all annual reviews, contracts for rentals of our facilities, and school handbooks.

869
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:06,969
So the sentence has been added to the draft.

870
01:05:07,629 --> 01:05:10,070
And again, the recommendation is up to the committee.

871
01:05:12,952 --> 01:05:14,333
This is a motion for approval by Ms.

872
01:05:14,353 --> 01:05:16,014
Mostone, seconded by Ms.

873
01:05:16,034 --> 01:05:16,694
Van de Kloot.

874
01:05:17,235 --> 01:05:18,035
Roll call vote, please.

875
01:05:18,675 --> 01:05:19,096
Policy.

876
01:05:19,756 --> 01:05:19,956
Ms.

877
01:05:19,976 --> 01:05:20,597
DiBenedetto.

878
01:05:20,797 --> 01:05:21,197
Thank you.

879
01:05:21,477 --> 01:05:22,898
Could we please read the motion?

880
01:05:26,113 --> 01:05:27,755
The incident report policy.

881
01:05:27,835 --> 01:05:31,779
So just so the community knows moving forward.

882
01:05:31,879 --> 01:05:37,525
I know it's a long policy, but I think that the people in our community are watching.

883
01:05:37,806 --> 01:05:40,408
They would benefit from hearing the policy.

884
01:05:41,029 --> 01:05:41,610
It is the report.

885
01:05:41,650 --> 01:05:44,493
I read it at our meeting last week, but I will read it again.

886
01:05:45,024 --> 01:05:45,384
Thank you.

887
01:05:45,424 --> 01:05:46,525
Policy definitions.

888
01:05:46,645 --> 01:05:47,226
Discovery.

889
01:05:47,346 --> 01:05:57,635
Finding any object or observing any situation that applies to the safety and security of the school and or school district which would negatively impact the well-being of students, faculty and staff.

890
01:05:58,496 --> 01:05:59,277
Notification.

891
01:05:59,637 --> 01:06:04,681
Verbal and or written communication to the appropriate authority including but not limited to the police department.

892
01:06:05,547 --> 01:06:15,593
Disposition, reporting of actions taken and conclusions reached that describe and explain the nature of the threat and or behavior identified, as well as any recommendations that emerge from the investigation.

893
01:06:16,253 --> 01:06:28,161
The policy is any individual who discovers an item, including but not limited to weapons, ammunition, explosives, drugs, any contraband items, shall notify the Medford Police Department immediately and inform the principal.

894
01:06:28,861 --> 01:06:33,483
If the principal cannot be reached, the individual who discovers the item should notify the superintendent of schools.

895
01:06:33,983 --> 01:06:37,785
This process will be in effect on a 24 hours a day, seven day a week basis.

896
01:06:38,465 --> 01:06:43,547
As soon as possible, the principal shall prepare a written report surrounding the incident and submit to the superintendent of schools.

897
01:06:44,227 --> 01:06:50,110
The school administration will promptly notify parents of situations that may affect the well-being of students, faculty, and staff.

898
01:06:50,670 --> 01:06:56,172
These notifications will be done consistent with applicable law, regulations, and policies of the Medford schools.

899
01:06:57,067 --> 01:07:07,574
Additionally, principals are required to immediately notify the office of the superintendent of schools about other incidents, including, but not limited to, accidents, fires, and suspension expulsion of students.

900
01:07:08,215 --> 01:07:13,398
Written reports concerning the incidents must be submitted to the superintendent no later than the next day following the incident.

901
01:07:14,119 --> 01:07:18,962
The principal or his or her designee must also notify the mayor and members of the school committee as soon as possible.

902
01:07:19,787 --> 01:07:27,251
Upon disposition of the investigation, the superintendent, in conjunction with the police department, will provide an appropriate written report to the mayor, school committee, and principal.

903
01:07:27,711 --> 01:07:34,294
This report shall include the facts surrounding the situation, conclusions reached, as well as any recommendations to be considered.

904
01:07:34,955 --> 01:07:40,778
This policy will be integrated into all annual reviews, contracts for rentals of our facilities, and school handbooks.

905
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:44,321
There's a motion on the floor for approval as seconded.

906
01:07:44,361 --> 01:07:44,522
Ms.

907
01:07:44,542 --> 01:07:45,482
Kretz, is there a question?

908
01:07:45,822 --> 01:07:52,006
Oh, I just wanted to, um, to give a big thank you to, um, everybody who sent us the reports last week.

909
01:07:52,406 --> 01:07:59,851
We were getting them and I got a lot of positive feedback from the community, um, regarding the robocalls and the information that was sent out.

910
01:08:00,391 --> 01:08:07,195
And it was, it was very quickly and, um, it was very, you know, very useful and very informative.

911
01:08:07,556 --> 01:08:09,557
I just wanted to say thank you before we did the roll call.

912
01:08:10,906 --> 01:08:11,066
Ms.

913
01:08:11,106 --> 01:08:11,567
Van de Kloot.

914
01:08:12,207 --> 01:08:20,012
I just want to make sure, though, that we received one report which had the name of a student.

915
01:08:20,192 --> 01:08:24,475
And I just want to make sure that it's deducted, because we should not have that information.

916
01:08:26,016 --> 01:08:31,119
Also, we do have a protocol for, what's it called, Paul?

917
01:08:31,139 --> 01:08:32,180
I can't remember.

918
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:37,403
A protocol when a student says something or is of concern

919
01:08:38,083 --> 01:08:44,606
a safety care, and I think that we should remind everybody that that is in existence and in place.

920
01:08:45,306 --> 01:09:04,934
If, in fact, a student makes some kind of threat, but the safety care protocol is followed, then while the school committee can be informed, I just, I received one robo-call from a principal, and I wondered how, if nothing was,

921
01:09:06,802 --> 01:09:27,141
if there was no reason to be concerned after professionals had assessed the child, and it was an elementary school child, and kids will be kids and say things, that I didn't want to, I think there's a balance between what some would call transparency, and my concern would be heightened

922
01:09:33,024 --> 01:09:37,547
I'm just wondering where the line is so it's not too much and it's not inappropriate.

923
01:09:37,947 --> 01:09:41,690
And that we're protecting our students appropriately.

924
01:09:42,430 --> 01:09:47,193
So I think it's a balance that we need to achieve.

925
01:09:47,253 --> 01:09:49,014
I think we probably need a little practice with it.

926
01:09:49,074 --> 01:09:55,778
But I do think that we put in place a couple of years ago the safety protocol for assessing situations.

927
01:09:56,278 --> 01:09:58,960
And I think that we need to make sure that we're sticking to that.

928
01:09:59,367 --> 01:10:10,432
And if nothing is determined, and it was by Elliot, then I don't think that there's a reason to alert every parent that a third grader said something.

929
01:10:12,573 --> 01:10:14,334
Because sometimes third graders say something.

930
01:10:14,354 --> 01:10:15,675
I mean, they're kids.

931
01:10:16,115 --> 01:10:16,995
They're kids.

932
01:10:17,416 --> 01:10:19,337
And we have to recognize that, too.

933
01:10:19,797 --> 01:10:28,361
In our concern about safety, we also need to be concerned about safety

934
01:10:30,656 --> 01:10:36,879
and worried about or realizing the impact on the fact that these are children.

935
01:10:37,980 --> 01:10:38,560
As always, Ms.

936
01:10:38,580 --> 01:10:40,281
Van, very thoughtful comments.

937
01:10:40,501 --> 01:10:42,202
And actually today we had a meeting.

938
01:10:42,703 --> 01:10:42,843
Ms.

939
01:10:43,523 --> 01:10:44,403
Nelson was present.

940
01:10:45,344 --> 01:10:49,927
Dr. Perrella, as well as our middle school principals, Mr. DeLever and assistant principal, Ms.

941
01:10:49,987 --> 01:10:50,747
Liu, was present.

942
01:10:51,353 --> 01:10:58,936
And we discussed that exact item, because it seems that people are getting information that really isn't necessary.

943
01:10:58,956 --> 01:11:07,860
The overhearing of a child saying something, and it being investigated, and it turns out to be simple just talk between two youngsters.

944
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:12,802
Certainly, a call out to the community isn't necessary.

945
01:11:13,622 --> 01:11:20,025
School committee will continue to be informed of things that go on, but it certainly, there has to be some decision making that happens.

946
01:11:20,628 --> 01:11:20,948
I think Ms.

947
01:11:21,008 --> 01:11:22,209
Nelson, were you going to?

948
01:11:22,229 --> 01:11:28,132
I was just going to say we share that same concern and we are currently, as Mayor Burke said, we met this morning.

949
01:11:28,152 --> 01:11:32,274
We're working out situations that really the robocall is needed.

950
01:11:32,314 --> 01:11:39,437
In other situations, like the ones that you've identified where it's probably something that is not something we want to do.

951
01:11:40,077 --> 01:11:48,862
And again, we want to protect the identity of children and we want to make sure that our schools are safe, but the robocalls can be overused.

952
01:11:49,002 --> 01:11:49,722
So we're working at a

953
01:11:50,098 --> 01:11:52,240
happy balance, hopefully we'll have it resolved soon.

954
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:52,800
Thank you.

955
01:11:52,820 --> 01:11:57,423
So there's a threat assessment matrix that has been incorporated into prior incidents.

956
01:11:57,564 --> 01:12:01,466
What we're going to add on is another column that talks about notification.

957
01:12:01,947 --> 01:12:09,012
So once they get through the boxes and they reach this set, yes, we need to inform the public and the teachers and the whole school system.

958
01:12:09,813 --> 01:12:14,296
And will you be bringing that to us at our next meeting?

959
01:12:15,457 --> 01:12:15,897
Hopefully.

960
01:12:16,057 --> 01:12:16,998
We can get it done by then.

961
01:12:17,238 --> 01:12:17,858
That would be great.

962
01:12:19,460 --> 01:12:19,740
Thank you.

963
01:12:20,822 --> 01:12:24,344
There's a roll call vote on the floor for this policy of incident report policy.

964
01:12:35,268 --> 01:12:37,129
Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

965
01:12:37,149 --> 01:12:38,009
The motion passes.

966
01:12:39,009 --> 01:12:41,831
Report on Medford High School graduation and dropout rates.

967
01:12:42,771 --> 01:12:47,613
So the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education just released

968
01:12:48,162 --> 01:12:53,184
their report on graduation and dropout rates of all high schools in the Commonwealth.

969
01:12:53,924 --> 01:12:57,786
And Dr. Perrella is here to share the good news about Medford, because we do have good news.

970
01:12:58,006 --> 01:12:59,046
Thank you, Dr. Perrella.

971
01:12:59,306 --> 01:13:00,066
Good evening, colleagues.

972
01:13:01,127 --> 01:13:09,210
I'm very pleased to be presenting this report of significant increases in our graduation rate and improvement in our dropout rate.

973
01:13:10,028 --> 01:13:12,169
Before I do so, I'd like to provide some context.

974
01:13:13,369 --> 01:13:18,591
About two years ago, we noticed a slight dip, 0.8% in our graduation rate.

975
01:13:19,391 --> 01:13:30,775
And after doing some data analysis, we realized it was very likely due to a variety of factors, but primarily the fourth year of math requirement that we had just approved the year before that.

976
01:13:31,755 --> 01:13:48,238
So what we did in the interim is we spent a lot of time looking at the data, looking at how we could improve these two significant indicators, and what we did was we identified that we could do some targeted individual intervention.

977
01:13:48,278 --> 01:13:59,880
This was in conjunction with the guidance department and with central office, who provided additionary tools, such as online credit recovery capacity, and I'm very happy to report that our

978
01:14:02,093 --> 01:14:04,336
Our graduation rate from 2006 to 2016 was 84.7%.

979
01:14:04,537 --> 01:14:05,017
In 2016 it was 83.9%.

980
01:14:13,265 --> 01:14:17,007
With the interventions that were put in place, we were able to improve that to 90.3%.

981
01:14:17,208 --> 01:14:25,573
And that includes positive impacts on all the following subgroups as well.

982
01:14:26,013 --> 01:14:27,094
Students with disabilities rose 8.8%.

983
01:14:27,134 --> 01:14:27,434
Low income, 6.9%.

984
01:14:27,474 --> 01:14:28,615
Students with high needs rose 8.5%.

985
01:14:28,655 --> 01:14:30,196
Our African American black population raised 13.9%.

986
01:14:30,236 --> 01:14:30,336
Asian, 11.6%.

987
01:14:40,816 --> 01:14:46,080
Hispanic Latino 1.3% and our white population at 2.9% increase.

988
01:14:46,701 --> 01:14:55,147
This also coincided with a significant drop in our dropout rate from a three year average of 3.6% to 2.7%.

989
01:14:55,748 --> 01:15:01,472
So we're very excited about these positive changes and we do anticipate them to continue as we move forward.

990
01:15:01,832 --> 01:15:03,694
I'd be happy to answer any questions regarding this.

991
01:15:04,234 --> 01:15:04,614
Very nice.

992
01:15:04,674 --> 01:15:05,395
Mr. Benedetto.

993
01:15:05,855 --> 01:15:06,236
Thank you.

994
01:15:06,656 --> 01:15:08,497
Thank you for the report.

995
01:15:08,537 --> 01:15:09,018
It's great.

996
01:15:09,830 --> 01:15:11,171
Great to see these increases.

997
01:15:11,751 --> 01:15:23,578
And as Mr. Belson would have always said, just because we might have a 90% doesn't mean that we're not still committed to the children that haven't passed in four years.

998
01:15:23,658 --> 01:15:28,221
Sometimes children take longer than four years to complete this work.

999
01:15:28,301 --> 01:15:32,743
And I remember him saying that many times when we get this report.

1000
01:15:32,783 --> 01:15:37,486
So I don't want anybody in the community to think that we just let kids go if they don't graduate.

1001
01:15:37,906 --> 01:15:39,027
We keep working with them.

1002
01:15:39,601 --> 01:15:42,781
until we can't anymore, you know?

1003
01:15:43,932 --> 01:15:44,232
Thank you.

1004
01:15:44,312 --> 01:15:45,093
It's really good news.

1005
01:15:45,233 --> 01:15:49,234
And if you notice that the 95% is the four year adjusted rate.

1006
01:15:49,254 --> 01:15:57,396
So that is students that we're able to work with over the summer who didn't graduate in June, but we were still able to get them to graduate by October 1st.

1007
01:15:57,716 --> 01:15:58,777
And I'd like to add one other thing.

1008
01:15:58,837 --> 01:16:08,900
This data looks great, but I would really love to share the experience of working with parents and families and being able to say, yes, your daughter or son will graduate in June.

1009
01:16:08,940 --> 01:16:10,820
They can go through the ceremony.

1010
01:16:11,001 --> 01:16:12,341
It's a very exciting,

1011
01:16:13,203 --> 01:16:22,004
opportunity for me to work with families like that and to see the faces of the students and the families when they can participate is really much more impressive than this data.

1012
01:16:23,002 --> 01:16:25,443
So it's 95% adjusted four-year rate?

1013
01:16:25,683 --> 01:16:25,903
Yes.

1014
01:16:26,203 --> 01:16:29,244
So that's just carrying you through the summer, or does it go beyond the summer?

1015
01:16:29,264 --> 01:16:30,304
That's carrying us through the summer.

1016
01:16:30,324 --> 01:16:30,524
Right, yes.

1017
01:16:30,544 --> 01:16:36,446
So what we do, some students are unable to meet that graduation requirement by graduation, but we still work with them over the summer.

1018
01:16:37,606 --> 01:16:43,447
And we can get that to 95%, like it shows, by the October 1st deadline.

1019
01:16:44,128 --> 01:16:44,528
Wonderful.

1020
01:16:45,148 --> 01:16:45,588
Great job.

1021
01:16:45,628 --> 01:16:45,908
Thank you.

1022
01:16:45,928 --> 01:16:46,148
Thank you.

1023
01:16:46,168 --> 01:16:48,909
Are there any other questions for Dr. Perrella?

1024
01:16:50,330 --> 01:16:51,571
Motion to receive this paper?

1025
01:16:51,591 --> 01:16:52,592
So motion.

1026
01:16:52,612 --> 01:16:55,034
Mr. Ruggiero, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

1027
01:16:55,074 --> 01:16:55,714
All those in favor?

1028
01:16:55,734 --> 01:16:55,794
Aye.

1029
01:16:56,535 --> 01:16:57,155
All those opposed?

1030
01:16:57,195 --> 01:16:57,916
Motion passes.

1031
01:16:59,077 --> 01:17:00,898
Pre-budget report finance.

1032
01:17:00,938 --> 01:17:01,639
Mr. Signi.

1033
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:12,267
I'd like to just preface by saying that, especially for the new members, that every year we begin the budget process with these pre-budget reports.

1034
01:17:13,108 --> 01:17:17,652
The department directors come before you over the next little bit, the next series of meetings.

1035
01:17:17,712 --> 01:17:19,313
We have them scheduled.

1036
01:17:19,794 --> 01:17:30,004
So by budget time, you can see what some of the priorities are for the departments, so you can make your priorities as you go into funding things as the budget rolls out.

1037
01:17:30,905 --> 01:17:41,555
Again, Mr. Zigney's done a great job his first full year as Fine Arts Director, and he's here to present what's been going on briefly, and also some of his needs moving forward.

1038
01:17:42,155 --> 01:17:42,455
very good.

1039
01:17:42,475 --> 01:17:42,876
Thank you.

1040
01:17:43,116 --> 01:17:43,396
Thank you.

1041
01:17:43,597 --> 01:17:44,057
Good evening.

1042
01:17:44,097 --> 01:18:01,996
Mr Benedetto before Mr Zigney starts, can I, can I make a motion to receive our 17 18 budget in some kind of online format so that way when people are presenting to us, we can review it easily and make notes so that way binder.

1043
01:18:02,697 --> 01:18:21,613
Well, I have the binder, and to see this with all the papers coming in, if it was electronically on a spreadsheet that we could see his department and what his budget was and what he's asking for, because throughout these meetings, it's weeks and weeks of these, you lose a paper and you're in trouble.

1044
01:18:22,493 --> 01:18:31,721
So I'm requesting, I'm making a motion that I'm trying to get us more online and less paper and less binders, and so we can really look at the data at any time.

1045
01:18:32,195 --> 01:18:44,665
So I'm making a request for this year's budget, the 17-18, or the second half of it, be presented to us in electronic format, so as we're getting these new papers.

1046
01:18:44,866 --> 01:18:45,506
It's online.

1047
01:18:47,348 --> 01:18:48,809
Is it broken down in each?

1048
01:18:48,829 --> 01:18:49,369
By department.

1049
01:18:50,370 --> 01:18:59,978
Not even by department, by subcategories in each department, so that way, like if Mr. Zigny asked for paper, which I know he's not, that paper line is there?

1050
01:19:01,814 --> 01:19:02,554
Okay.

1051
01:19:03,595 --> 01:19:03,955
All right.

1052
01:19:04,275 --> 01:19:05,315
So I'll look at that.

1053
01:19:05,455 --> 01:19:09,997
Um, well there's a motion on the floor to have it sent to us as committee members.

1054
01:19:13,978 --> 01:19:15,678
It's PDF downloadable, correct?

1055
01:19:16,459 --> 01:19:17,759
It's a PDF download.

1056
01:19:18,079 --> 01:19:19,019
PDF downloadable.

1057
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:21,500
Okay.

1058
01:19:23,121 --> 01:19:30,923
Can we look forward and make steps to make sure that the current, the next year's budget is in some type of electronic full, um,

1059
01:19:32,710 --> 01:19:38,571
so that the committee can receive it and look at it as an active document throughout the school year for next year.

1060
01:19:39,251 --> 01:19:40,632
I'm making a proposal.

1061
01:19:40,792 --> 01:19:49,473
I just think that this is so hard to keep track of all these papers in each department as they come forward, and we can make notes next to them as they're presenting.

1062
01:19:50,353 --> 01:19:51,693
It would be really helpful.

1063
01:19:53,494 --> 01:20:00,155
I just have one question, because if we have last year's budget, it will not reflect the needs moving forward.

1064
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:08,445
Would it make more sense to send electronically the one-page summary that goes back to this year and then moves forward to this year?

1065
01:20:08,485 --> 01:20:14,569
Because, again, you won't have in the report of last year's budget what the request is for this year.

1066
01:20:15,390 --> 01:20:23,595
So we could send one page electronically for all the departments when they prepare them, and then you'd have last year and this year's side-by-side.

1067
01:20:25,056 --> 01:20:27,017
And you could keep it in a file on your computer.

1068
01:20:27,037 --> 01:20:29,139
That would work.

1069
01:20:30,462 --> 01:20:33,644
I'll bring this up when we talk about at our next meeting.

1070
01:20:33,724 --> 01:20:36,045
It's just something to think about moving forward.

1071
01:20:36,965 --> 01:20:49,670
I really want more electronic documentation and less books in front of us and ways to make, you know, bring us forward so that way we can keep track of things as they're presented throughout the school year.

1072
01:20:50,511 --> 01:20:52,392
You know, budget updates as well.

1073
01:20:52,752 --> 01:20:54,312
So we have it all in one area.

1074
01:20:54,352 --> 01:20:57,794
It's just so much easier than trying to go back to meetings and stuff.

1075
01:20:58,633 --> 01:20:59,333
Is it dinging?

1076
01:20:59,433 --> 01:21:00,133
Something's dinging.

1077
01:21:00,253 --> 01:21:01,213
Can you hear it?

1078
01:21:02,314 --> 01:21:04,474
My mother-in-law is in the hospital, so I'm sorry.

1079
01:21:04,494 --> 01:21:05,174
Oh, that's what I'm hearing.

1080
01:21:05,274 --> 01:21:07,074
Yeah, I have to keep my phone on today.

1081
01:21:07,094 --> 01:21:08,295
I don't know where it's coming from.

1082
01:21:08,315 --> 01:21:11,375
My mother-in-law is very ill, so I'm getting updates on her.

1083
01:21:11,975 --> 01:21:12,995
I've been there all weekend.

1084
01:21:13,195 --> 01:21:14,376
Sorry for the inconvenience.

1085
01:21:14,396 --> 01:21:14,976
Mr. Ruggiero.

1086
01:21:16,196 --> 01:21:20,777
I think that it would be very useful for us as a committee to actually have something that's machine readable as well.

1087
01:21:21,037 --> 01:21:27,438
Just having a PDF is not as useful as having something that is where the data can actually be read.

1088
01:21:29,711 --> 01:21:35,792
And I also think it'd be great for us to have an easy way to visualize the budget, whether it's a pie chart people can click on.

1089
01:21:35,872 --> 01:21:37,953
I'm happy to do a lot of the visualization work.

1090
01:21:38,513 --> 01:21:39,413
I just need the data.

1091
01:21:39,913 --> 01:21:43,014
That's machine readable, because I'm not going to data entry it all step by step.

1092
01:21:43,654 --> 01:21:44,114
Thank you.

1093
01:21:44,494 --> 01:21:49,095
We can certainly download it to a data CSV file.

1094
01:21:49,135 --> 01:21:49,995
Yeah, then I can.

1095
01:21:50,195 --> 01:21:51,655
We can do a lot of great stuff with that.

1096
01:21:51,975 --> 01:21:52,135
Ms.

1097
01:21:52,155 --> 01:21:52,395
Kratz.

1098
01:21:52,695 --> 01:21:54,156
Yes, I have a question.

1099
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:56,496
I mean, I know a lot of people are talking about going

1100
01:21:56,977 --> 01:21:59,059
electronic and I think it's fantastic.

1101
01:21:59,699 --> 01:22:12,388
Is there going to be a plan for the school committee members to get like tablets or iPads, you know, I mean, I have my phone, but you know, um, so that we have it to view electronically.

1102
01:22:13,129 --> 01:22:14,189
We did talk about that.

1103
01:22:14,229 --> 01:22:21,715
I believe we moved it into your committee to discuss a means for us to go paper free and that's being thought about.

1104
01:22:22,967 --> 01:22:31,851
So in the interim, until we have those devices, are the people who don't have the laptops going to get their paper copy?

1105
01:22:33,411 --> 01:22:33,691
Yes.

1106
01:22:34,452 --> 01:22:35,572
The paper copy is here.

1107
01:22:36,032 --> 01:22:36,252
Right.

1108
01:22:36,492 --> 01:22:44,556
So we're getting the paper copy that she's requested, and then the big document is online as well for last year.

1109
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:55,521
I also started off with a school committee Facebook page for my firm.

1110
01:22:55,541 --> 01:22:58,961
We can all talk about how we want to address that as well.

1111
01:22:59,602 --> 01:23:04,963
But if you ever want me to send you their digital copies, that's why I'm letting you know.

1112
01:23:05,043 --> 01:23:06,883
But I don't, once again, it's not machine readable.

1113
01:23:06,943 --> 01:23:14,184
So if the PDFs could actually have the text on there, that would be my way.

1114
01:23:14,204 --> 01:23:14,644
Mr. Zigny.

1115
01:23:14,684 --> 01:23:14,784
Hi.

1116
01:23:14,804 --> 01:23:15,104
Welcome.

1117
01:23:15,184 --> 01:23:15,744
He's patient.

1118
01:23:15,784 --> 01:23:16,284
Welcome.

1119
01:23:16,404 --> 01:23:17,645
Sorry for digressing.

1120
01:23:17,685 --> 01:23:18,945
Not a problem.

1121
01:23:20,707 --> 01:23:21,167
Are we ready?

1122
01:23:23,008 --> 01:23:26,009
Quick overview of department, what we do.

1123
01:23:26,989 --> 01:23:33,772
At the elementary level for music, K-5 all students get a weekly general music class.

1124
01:23:34,892 --> 01:23:37,893
And also we have the after school troublemakers chorus.

1125
01:23:38,093 --> 01:23:43,435
I got to hear them giving a rousing rendition of Don't Stop Believing as I left the school today.

1126
01:23:43,695 --> 01:23:43,855
Ms.

1127
01:23:43,895 --> 01:23:46,656
Turner meets with them on Monday afternoons at the high school.

1128
01:23:47,490 --> 01:23:53,353
A string program starts in 4th grade and a band program starts in 5th.

1129
01:23:53,513 --> 01:24:01,877
So kids who might play violin in 4th grade as they move on, they can either continue in 5th grade or a lot of them like to switch to band.

1130
01:24:02,437 --> 01:24:05,179
But that's what's happening at the elementary level.

1131
01:24:06,119 --> 01:24:13,403
The middle school, both middle schools have general music as well as band and orchestra twice a week.

1132
01:24:14,143 --> 01:24:16,064
And the McGlynn Middle School has chorus.

1133
01:24:17,325 --> 01:24:23,186
And at the high school, we've been able to expand our offerings over the last couple of years, which is great.

1134
01:24:23,707 --> 01:24:32,048
In addition to band, orchestra, and chorus, there's percussion and guitar, music appreciation, music technology, and musical theater.

1135
01:24:33,029 --> 01:24:39,710
And this year, the percussion and guitar is going to be able to be offered to freshmen coming in.

1136
01:24:40,811 --> 01:24:46,712
We made a lot of adjustments and looked at the scheduling and made a lot of, I think, improvements.

1137
01:24:47,613 --> 01:24:57,320
move things around so there'll be more opportunity for the 8th graders coming in as 9th graders to take more music classes as well as art classes.

1138
01:24:57,340 --> 01:25:04,165
They'll also be able to take either comprehensive art or art appreciation so all of those will be open to freshmen.

1139
01:25:05,346 --> 01:25:12,852
For the art classes at the elementary and the middle school they all have weekly art classes K-8

1140
01:25:14,244 --> 01:25:23,887
And at the high school, there's ceramics, sculpture, drawing, AP drawing, AP 2D design, comprehensive art, and art appreciation and practice.

1141
01:25:23,907 --> 01:25:29,408
So we have a lot of different offerings in the department.

1142
01:25:29,468 --> 01:25:33,749
This past year, a lot of budget money in the music side of it.

1143
01:25:34,969 --> 01:25:40,691
Went for performance sheet music, instrument repair and replacement, piano tuning, classroom instruments.

1144
01:25:41,582 --> 01:25:44,263
And actually, most importantly, curriculum materials.

1145
01:25:45,143 --> 01:25:58,447
And on the art side, expenditures including ceramics and sculpture equipment, maintenance, paint, drawing, construction paper, various adhesives, markers, clay, pencils, accessories.

1146
01:25:58,927 --> 01:26:04,769
There are really a lot of consumable supplies on the art side, where a lot of our budget went.

1147
01:26:05,890 --> 01:26:09,651
For accomplishments, each year we do at least 14 major

1148
01:26:10,925 --> 01:26:17,747
concerts at night and that doesn't count all of the performances the kids do during the school day.

1149
01:26:18,547 --> 01:26:29,910
I think we give more concerts than any other which one has to do with the size of our theater but two I think it's good.

1150
01:26:30,290 --> 01:26:31,090
And outside events.

1151
01:26:31,772 --> 01:26:33,533
And outside events that you come to.

1152
01:26:33,814 --> 01:26:34,954
Absolutely, absolutely.

1153
01:26:35,555 --> 01:26:42,079
And a lot of other communities might do just one big one in the winter, one big one in the spring, and it lasts three hours.

1154
01:26:42,120 --> 01:26:44,101
And each group only plays a couple of pieces.

1155
01:26:44,161 --> 01:26:47,003
And I think this way, the kids get a lot more out of it.

1156
01:26:47,083 --> 01:26:57,771
And it's actually to the credit of the teachers, not only who teach these specific ensembles, but who also come just to help out so that we can present all of these concerts.

1157
01:26:59,654 --> 01:27:03,337
The Medford High School Band won nine trophies at six competitions.

1158
01:27:04,218 --> 01:27:08,182
They hosted its fifth annual NESBA championship finals, placing third.

1159
01:27:09,703 --> 01:27:11,685
They performed at the city inauguration.

1160
01:27:12,346 --> 01:27:17,010
We had one member accepted the MMEA Northeast District Senior Festival.

1161
01:27:18,091 --> 01:27:23,716
And the band will be going to Florida, the Magic Kingdom, right before April vacation.

1162
01:27:24,301 --> 01:27:33,909
to play in Orlando and they'll play at Disney World as well as demonstrate for a group called Give the Kids a World which is part of the Make a Wish Foundation.

1163
01:27:33,929 --> 01:27:38,693
So they'll be doing a lot of community service type things there as well.

1164
01:27:40,054 --> 01:27:45,739
The Medford High School Orchestra, we had 3 members accepted to the MMEA Northeast District Festival.

1165
01:27:46,638 --> 01:27:50,801
and two members were selected to the All-State Orchestra this past Saturday.

1166
01:27:50,861 --> 01:28:03,009
I had the privilege of watching Justin Zeng and Arden Ingersoll perform on the stage at Symphony Hall with the Massachusetts All-State Orchestra and actually it was a performance worthy of Symphony Hall.

1167
01:28:03,469 --> 01:28:04,930
They did a fantastic job.

1168
01:28:05,531 --> 01:28:10,334
And I'd like to actually publicly thank Justin Zeng's mom, Jane, because she took

1169
01:28:10,653 --> 01:28:13,996
Thursday off from work, Friday off from work, because we needed to send the chaperone.

1170
01:28:14,016 --> 01:28:25,807
And she was our representative and was there all day Thursday, Thursday night, all day Friday, Friday night, and most of the Saturday being our representative and watching out for the kids.

1171
01:28:25,887 --> 01:28:29,951
And it was a huge help to me and the department, and we really appreciated that.

1172
01:28:30,131 --> 01:28:33,815
So it was a really great, great experience for all of the kids.

1173
01:28:34,553 --> 01:28:39,737
And in a couple of weeks, Mrs. Chang is taking her middle school string ensemble on March 25th.

1174
01:28:39,977 --> 01:28:46,682
They'll be competing at the King Phillip Regional High School in Rentham for their annual Micah Festival.

1175
01:28:47,103 --> 01:28:53,407
And hopefully she's brought home many medals over the years and hopefully we'll be getting one more.

1176
01:28:56,570 --> 01:29:03,475
On the art side of it, among the many things the art teachers do, there's all kinds of displays not only in the schools but around the city.

1177
01:29:04,100 --> 01:29:11,204
Medford Children's Art Showcase, Arts Council Exhibits, West Medford Open Studio Displays.

1178
01:29:12,225 --> 01:29:17,768
Just recently, three Medford High School students were recognized by the Scholastic Arts Awards.

1179
01:29:18,569 --> 01:29:23,872
And I think in an upcoming meeting, I'll be submitting those names so that we can

1180
01:29:24,414 --> 01:29:25,775
can recognize those students.

1181
01:29:26,715 --> 01:29:34,260
A docent training partnership with the Museum of Fine Arts and they had a joint field trip along with the history department to the Museum of Fine Arts.

1182
01:29:34,860 --> 01:29:37,782
So the art department was very active also.

1183
01:29:39,242 --> 01:29:41,904
As lead teacher I was involved in a lot of things.

1184
01:29:41,924 --> 01:29:52,270
This was the first year I was really involved with the budget and over the course of the year I think I got a handle on things and figured out a few ways to do things a bit differently.

1185
01:29:52,733 --> 01:29:58,318
So as far as the requests, just some minor increases is what I'm asking for.

1186
01:29:59,680 --> 01:30:01,442
Pretty much level funding is great.

1187
01:30:01,822 --> 01:30:03,664
A little bit more money for piano tuning.

1188
01:30:04,865 --> 01:30:11,531
We have, across the city, we have 15 pianos that we actually use either for concerts or

1189
01:30:13,312 --> 01:30:15,393
We have a lot more, but it's 15 are in use.

1190
01:30:16,254 --> 01:30:20,336
And some authorities say you should tune them twice a year.

1191
01:30:20,416 --> 01:30:23,517
Everybody agrees they should be tuned once every year.

1192
01:30:24,278 --> 01:30:27,479
We haven't had enough to do that, so we kind of triaged them a little bit.

1193
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:31,802
But a little bit more money for that would be helpful.

1194
01:30:32,742 --> 01:30:38,525
And the band has grown in numbers, as well as equipment and in activity.

1195
01:30:39,664 --> 01:30:44,568
And we're looking just for an increase in the, um, bus transportation for the band.

1196
01:30:44,609 --> 01:30:46,370
They do a ton of fundraising as it is.

1197
01:30:46,390 --> 01:30:51,134
Um, if they could do a little less fundraising, a little bit more playing, that would be a great thing.

1198
01:30:51,194 --> 01:30:55,678
So if we can increase their, their bus budget a bit, that would be, that would be helpful.

1199
01:30:55,758 --> 01:30:55,938
Great.

1200
01:30:56,178 --> 01:30:56,478
Thank you.

1201
01:30:56,498 --> 01:30:58,540
Mr. Signey, Mr. Russo, you.

1202
01:30:58,980 --> 01:30:59,921
I'm sorry.

1203
01:31:01,222 --> 01:31:02,263
Thank you very much for this.

1204
01:31:02,603 --> 01:31:07,928
Um, I see you're not asking for more money for art supplies.

1205
01:31:08,848 --> 01:31:21,321
And I'm just wondering, my experience at the elementary level was that the art teachers seemed to be out of supplies before Christmas every year.

1206
01:31:21,561 --> 01:31:21,801
Yes.

1207
01:31:22,042 --> 01:31:23,523
That's not going to happen.

1208
01:31:23,963 --> 01:31:24,624
It isn't happening.

1209
01:31:25,565 --> 01:31:29,829
What I did do is, again, the art side of it was a little bit more alien to me.

1210
01:31:29,869 --> 01:31:31,851
But after going through it, one of the things

1211
01:31:32,994 --> 01:31:38,479
I realized was there are certain things that they all need and they all order separately.

1212
01:31:39,299 --> 01:31:43,943
So they all need drawing paper, they all need Elmer's glue, they all need glue sticks.

1213
01:31:44,304 --> 01:31:54,552
Rather than having seven or eight separate orders, I've combined them all and just ordered them all together, which means we can buy

1214
01:31:55,623 --> 01:32:02,788
more for less, basically, because we're getting the bulk, which is leaving us more money for them to get some other things.

1215
01:32:03,088 --> 01:32:03,328
Great.

1216
01:32:03,788 --> 01:32:18,297
And after, again, getting through the year and seeing what we have left and what I was able to buy, I'm actually in the process of getting actually more for them for the rest of this year and next year, too.

1217
01:32:18,377 --> 01:32:18,678
Excellent.

1218
01:32:18,898 --> 01:32:19,738
Thank you.

1219
01:32:19,918 --> 01:32:22,100
I do understand that's been in the past.

1220
01:32:23,258 --> 01:32:25,979
felt like Santa Claus when I said, hey, I just bought these.

1221
01:32:26,219 --> 01:32:28,080
Oh, this is great.

1222
01:32:28,660 --> 01:32:30,681
So I think we're OK there.

1223
01:32:30,941 --> 01:32:31,402
Great.

1224
01:32:31,422 --> 01:32:32,362
Thank you so much.

1225
01:32:33,082 --> 01:32:33,423
Thank you.

1226
01:32:33,923 --> 01:32:34,603
Mr. Ruggiero?

1227
01:32:35,483 --> 01:32:36,044
Two questions.

1228
01:32:36,304 --> 01:32:40,026
So the first, I noticed the increase in van bus transportation.

1229
01:32:40,606 --> 01:32:44,928
So right now, you're making up the $5,000 as fundraising.

1230
01:32:44,968 --> 01:32:47,049
Is that where that money is coming from right now?

1231
01:32:47,149 --> 01:32:48,369
A lot more than that, yeah.

1232
01:32:50,623 --> 01:32:59,526
Bus prices have gone up, the band has gone bigger, so they need additional buses, which isn't necessarily commensurate with that many more kids, but you need a certain number of kids per bus.

1233
01:33:00,206 --> 01:33:02,387
So, yeah, they need more buses.

1234
01:33:02,647 --> 01:33:04,688
They do a lot of fundraising, as it is.

1235
01:33:06,348 --> 01:33:10,050
So, yeah, even with that amount of money, there's still going to be fundraising for more buses.

1236
01:33:10,630 --> 01:33:11,690
But that's going to help a bit.

1237
01:33:12,691 --> 01:33:15,792
Yeah, and my second question involves the instructional supplies.

1238
01:33:17,522 --> 01:33:24,347
Has your department reached out to like Blick and Michael's Arts and Crafts to see if we could get a grant from them to get some art supplies?

1239
01:33:24,467 --> 01:33:33,253
That's something, you know, we do ask for price quotes, which usually gives us a much better deal over list prices.

1240
01:33:34,174 --> 01:33:41,259
But grant is a good idea, and that's something that I'll get a handle on, hopefully, in the future.

1241
01:33:43,741 --> 01:33:44,041
Thank you.

1242
01:33:44,361 --> 01:33:45,102
Mr. Benedetto.

1243
01:33:45,562 --> 01:33:45,902
Thank you.

1244
01:33:48,350 --> 01:33:52,992
Through you, could we please send a letter to Mrs. Zang?

1245
01:33:53,232 --> 01:33:53,792
Is that her name?

1246
01:33:53,912 --> 01:33:55,093
Yes.

1247
01:33:55,533 --> 01:34:00,315
Thanking her for her commitment to the Method High School, or for her students and her time.

1248
01:34:01,435 --> 01:34:02,096
Justin's mom?

1249
01:34:02,336 --> 01:34:02,856
Justin's mom.

1250
01:34:02,896 --> 01:34:03,376
Justin's mom.

1251
01:34:03,756 --> 01:34:11,459
So I would like a letter sent from the school committee showing our appreciation for her chaperoning our students and taking that time from work.

1252
01:34:12,180 --> 01:34:17,122
And my second item was to thank Mr. Zigny for coming first.

1253
01:34:18,024 --> 01:34:20,665
and putting up with my questions before you got to present.

1254
01:34:20,825 --> 01:34:21,245
Out of the way.

1255
01:34:21,365 --> 01:34:25,327
I thought if I went first, there'd be more money, but I guess it doesn't work that way.

1256
01:34:26,548 --> 01:34:26,908
It might.

1257
01:34:26,928 --> 01:34:27,428
Who knows?

1258
01:34:27,448 --> 01:34:27,828
Rookie mistake.

1259
01:34:27,908 --> 01:34:28,368
I don't know.

1260
01:34:28,649 --> 01:34:29,609
It doesn't hurt to try.

1261
01:34:29,929 --> 01:34:32,850
But thank you, Mr. Zigny, for coming forward.

1262
01:34:32,910 --> 01:34:38,533
And congratulations on presenting your first budget and almost completing your first year.

1263
01:34:38,553 --> 01:34:39,413
You've got a ways to go.

1264
01:34:39,973 --> 01:34:42,875
And I make a motion to approve this.

1265
01:34:43,755 --> 01:34:44,815
Motion to accept this report.

1266
01:34:44,835 --> 01:34:45,516
I accept the report.

1267
01:34:46,763 --> 01:34:46,943
Ms.

1268
01:34:46,963 --> 01:34:48,565
Van de Kloot.

1269
01:34:48,845 --> 01:34:49,025
Ms.

1270
01:34:49,065 --> 01:34:49,345
Mia.

1271
01:34:51,487 --> 01:34:52,328
Thank you for the report.

1272
01:34:52,368 --> 01:34:53,829
And I just, you do a ton.

1273
01:34:54,169 --> 01:35:05,498
And I just wanted to give a shout out to Mr. Connor, the Roberts School teacher, music teacher, who now already stays after school Tuesday for our hand chime choir for fourth and fifth graders.

1274
01:35:06,039 --> 01:35:10,743
He stays after school on Thursday for fourth and fifth graders for trombone for an hour.

1275
01:35:10,883 --> 01:35:15,647
And then he stays and lets sixth, seventh, and eighth graders come back and teaches them for an hour.

1276
01:35:16,382 --> 01:35:24,328
And then now on Friday, he's keeping kids after for a little recorder ensemble to be in one of the music concerts in the spring.

1277
01:35:24,388 --> 01:35:28,471
So he is one of the most humble, hardworking music teachers I've ever met.

1278
01:35:28,531 --> 01:35:33,035
And in addition to that, we've had a really good year of professional development.

1279
01:35:34,115 --> 01:35:35,076
And Mr. Conner and Ms.

1280
01:35:35,136 --> 01:35:40,280
Turner have presented professional development workshops for the music teachers.

1281
01:35:42,788 --> 01:35:56,799
Also, the art teachers, Peter Gallagher and Suzanne Fee on the art side, have presented art professional development, which has been well received and very useful, and just another thing that Mr. Connor has done for us.

1282
01:35:57,479 --> 01:35:57,820
Thank you.

1283
01:35:57,840 --> 01:35:58,981
Just a funny little story.

1284
01:35:59,021 --> 01:36:08,067
I was at the Roberts before school, and there were a couple of kids that were out in the schoolyard playing their recorders, walking around, and it's like, and everybody's fooling them.

1285
01:36:08,147 --> 01:36:09,388
It was really adorable.

1286
01:36:09,428 --> 01:36:11,190
So he's doing a fabulous job.

1287
01:36:13,399 --> 01:36:17,081
Yes, I just wanted to add my voice to thanking all of your teachers.

1288
01:36:18,061 --> 01:36:21,323
I, you know, attend as many concerts as I possibly can.

1289
01:36:21,643 --> 01:36:30,627
I know Mrs. Kretz and I and some other members were at the winter concerts and, you know, you listen to the orchestra concert.

1290
01:36:30,987 --> 01:36:34,729
It is the thing that makes me, I think, so proud.

1291
01:36:35,619 --> 01:36:43,426
when I can talk to other people and say, yes, all of our kids get to, you know, try out stringed instruments.

1292
01:36:43,486 --> 01:36:45,448
And then they can do something in fifth grade.

1293
01:36:45,468 --> 01:36:46,629
And people really are amazed.

1294
01:36:46,649 --> 01:36:49,692
I mean, I tell them how many people we have in our orchestra.

1295
01:36:50,072 --> 01:36:55,396
And then the band concert, the winter band concert, it was just blow your socks off.

1296
01:36:56,518 --> 01:36:58,939
just so I wish everybody had been able to make it.

1297
01:36:58,979 --> 01:37:02,159
So I really appreciate all the hard work of your teachers and yourself.

1298
01:37:02,479 --> 01:37:03,059
Thank you very much.

1299
01:37:03,120 --> 01:37:03,400
Thank you.

1300
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:04,400
Very good.

1301
01:37:04,760 --> 01:37:05,160
Thank you.

1302
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:12,502
There's a motion on the floor to place this report on file as seconded by Mr Russo.

1303
01:37:13,062 --> 01:37:16,863
All those in pro all those in approval, all those opposed.

1304
01:37:17,403 --> 01:37:18,023
Motion passes.

1305
01:37:18,043 --> 01:37:18,523
Thank you.

1306
01:37:21,322 --> 01:37:25,863
Recommendation to approve the school calendar for 2018-19 school year.

1307
01:37:25,883 --> 01:37:25,923
Ms.

1308
01:37:26,263 --> 01:37:26,744
Nelson.

1309
01:37:28,664 --> 01:37:31,825
You have attached the draft of the school calendar for next year.

1310
01:37:31,845 --> 01:37:41,388
We'd like to get it out this time of year so people can start to plan for vacations and again for other events coming up.

1311
01:37:43,975 --> 01:37:45,615
Do you want to just highlight some of the dates, Beverly?

1312
01:37:45,695 --> 01:37:45,855
Right.

1313
01:37:46,096 --> 01:37:48,276
I think, um, Ms.

1314
01:37:48,316 --> 01:37:49,876
Vandekloot, did you have... Ms.

1315
01:37:49,916 --> 01:37:50,357
Vandekloot?

1316
01:37:50,477 --> 01:37:50,617
Yeah.

1317
01:37:50,717 --> 01:38:03,300
I had a question because I understand that, um, the, um, that there's going to be an election or preliminary election and is it the first day of school?

1318
01:38:04,540 --> 01:38:06,821
No, I believe... It's the Tuesday after Labor Day.

1319
01:38:06,901 --> 01:38:07,121
Right.

1320
01:38:07,441 --> 01:38:12,182
Again, the professional development days, I just noticed on this, we do have to adjust those.

1321
01:38:12,855 --> 01:38:22,160
That can be, again, an adjustment there because I believe the election dates were the September 4th, and then the other one was in November.

1322
01:38:22,660 --> 01:38:25,682
So again, I noticed that March is on there for the second one.

1323
01:38:26,102 --> 01:38:36,788
Traditionally, we have one in the fall and one in the spring, but if it needs, if we need the schools for the elections, we can make that adjustment before we get this out.

1324
01:38:36,888 --> 01:38:39,230
So we would have school on September 4th?

1325
01:38:40,915 --> 01:38:41,736
or school would be in session?

1326
01:38:41,756 --> 01:38:48,701
Well, right now, I think we have to have a discussion as to whether or not we feel we can have the election and have school in session, which we've done.

1327
01:38:48,881 --> 01:38:54,966
It depends on how you structure the professional development, again, and the kids being in session.

1328
01:38:55,026 --> 01:38:58,008
So we've done it before, but we'll need a conversation.

1329
01:38:58,128 --> 01:39:02,792
I'm not sure how many people would be, again, using the data vote.

1330
01:39:03,913 --> 01:39:05,754
Well, I'm just a little concerned about it.

1331
01:39:06,235 --> 01:39:08,817
The students grade 1 to 12 go back the 28th, 29th, 30th,

1332
01:39:11,518 --> 01:39:18,722
then they're off Friday, they're off Monday, and then Tuesday would be the election day.

1333
01:39:18,782 --> 01:39:21,543
I mean, clearly when we think about concerns about security.

1334
01:39:21,623 --> 01:39:27,026
So I just, I think we need to think this through and look at that particular date.

1335
01:39:27,046 --> 01:39:31,788
I don't know if any other members have thought about this yet.

1336
01:39:32,128 --> 01:39:36,830
I don't want to leave them out of school for, it seems difficult to leave them out of school for another day.

1337
01:39:38,491 --> 01:39:39,912
So, but I was a little concerned.

1338
01:39:40,895 --> 01:39:49,280
Traditionally, we've canceled school except, I believe, the last primary, the numbers were expected to be so very low that we did hold a session.

1339
01:39:49,300 --> 01:39:50,740
We had school in session.

1340
01:39:50,760 --> 01:39:52,921
This is a state election.

1341
01:39:53,222 --> 01:39:53,642
I'm sorry.

1342
01:39:53,982 --> 01:39:55,403
This is a state election.

1343
01:39:56,143 --> 01:39:57,944
And the numbers are expected to be very low.

1344
01:39:57,964 --> 01:39:59,165
Higher than what we expected.

1345
01:40:01,386 --> 01:40:10,691
I think it's very tricky because professional development days, having them all at the start of the year, then you don't have any time to do anything else the rest of the year is problematic.

1346
01:40:11,179 --> 01:40:15,823
Perhaps in the new contract we'll get additional days, but right now we're living with what we have.

1347
01:40:15,843 --> 01:40:22,389
And we can make that adjustment on this draft if we feel it's necessary, change the March 11th to the September 4th.

1348
01:40:22,709 --> 01:40:31,777
But remember one thing, we do not, the dates the school start and that first week is determined not by administration, but by the contract.

1349
01:40:32,377 --> 01:40:32,658
All right?

1350
01:40:32,698 --> 01:40:37,542
The teachers in the last contract opted to go back to school before Labor Day.

1351
01:40:38,067 --> 01:40:42,229
And so again, they start on Monday when the teachers come in prior to Labor Day.

1352
01:40:42,950 --> 01:40:48,472
The teachers themselves wanted Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday to be full days for students.

1353
01:40:48,512 --> 01:40:51,294
They did not want a PD day when they first came back.

1354
01:40:52,074 --> 01:40:56,757
They wanted Friday off before Labor Day to have the long weekend, and of course, Labor Day.

1355
01:40:57,257 --> 01:41:00,939
So when we get calls saying, you start school before Labor Day, how can you do that?

1356
01:41:00,979 --> 01:41:02,500
We are bound by the contract.

1357
01:41:03,040 --> 01:41:06,902
And that's why we have this schedule the week before Labor Day.

1358
01:41:07,352 --> 01:41:10,974
So again, the day after Labor Day being the election, we'll have to make a decision on that.

1359
01:41:13,895 --> 01:41:14,635
Mr. Benedetto.

1360
01:41:14,856 --> 01:41:15,216
Thank you.

1361
01:41:15,236 --> 01:41:18,097
Um, through you too, uh, Ms.

1362
01:41:18,137 --> 01:41:30,783
Nelson is, I know the teachers are up for contract renewal and I'm wondering if we could possibly talk to them about working that Friday in exchange for the Tuesday.

1363
01:41:31,123 --> 01:41:34,705
So that way that safe or even a half a day of those that day,

1364
01:41:35,217 --> 01:41:44,941
rather than the children not be present for such a long period and still ensure their safety on the date of the preliminary election.

1365
01:41:45,761 --> 01:41:47,482
That's something we can look at.

1366
01:41:47,502 --> 01:41:50,303
Be moving forward, yes.

1367
01:41:51,143 --> 01:41:52,944
And that's for August, right?

1368
01:41:54,785 --> 01:41:55,345
This year, so.

1369
01:41:55,385 --> 01:41:56,766
It's the Friday of the long weekend.

1370
01:41:57,686 --> 01:42:01,928
So the calendar, again, we have had it reviewed by administrators.

1371
01:42:01,968 --> 01:42:02,728
We've sent it out.

1372
01:42:04,205 --> 01:42:14,053
Everyone seems to think there are no conflicts, except perhaps for the professional development day, and that would give us, with seven snow days, a closing of June 24th.

1373
01:42:14,393 --> 01:42:20,518
So again, we still have a relatively early closing in June if we don't use a substantial number of snow days.

1374
01:42:21,279 --> 01:42:32,028
So again, you can just, again, inform us what you'd like us to do with the professional development days, if you'd like to schedule it in on the 4th, or we can leave it as is,

1375
01:42:32,342 --> 01:42:34,403
We have moved professional development days around.

1376
01:42:34,444 --> 01:42:36,425
We've done it just this past month.

1377
01:42:37,426 --> 01:42:41,509
So it can be done with proper notification to parents and to teachers and so on.

1378
01:42:42,309 --> 01:42:44,591
So whatever you want me to do, we can adjust.

1379
01:42:45,932 --> 01:42:48,654
But I'd like to get it out because people are looking for it.

1380
01:42:48,734 --> 01:42:50,895
And other communities have it on their website.

1381
01:42:50,915 --> 01:42:51,095
So.

1382
01:42:52,716 --> 01:42:55,518
We have had school before.

1383
01:42:55,538 --> 01:42:57,840
And if we have school,

1384
01:43:02,612 --> 01:43:07,676
people who come in to vote at the schools are segregated from completely?

1385
01:43:08,276 --> 01:43:08,756
Correct.

1386
01:43:09,237 --> 01:43:09,657
Correct.

1387
01:43:10,838 --> 01:43:20,485
If I recall, the issue that caused schools to close was an accident outside of school in a town that's next door to us.

1388
01:43:21,485 --> 01:43:27,189
And that caused a lot of concern throughout all the school systems that use schools for voting locations.

1389
01:43:31,272 --> 01:43:31,773
Mr. Russo.

1390
01:43:33,098 --> 01:43:36,840
So I'm sorry, I'm just very familiar with the Columbus's layout.

1391
01:43:37,120 --> 01:43:47,246
And I'm just really trying to, so we have had people voting in that cafeteria when there were 400 kids eating there.

1392
01:43:48,026 --> 01:43:49,647
If I could address that.

1393
01:43:49,707 --> 01:44:00,853
So at the Columbus schools, we sometimes use the two classrooms that are on that first floor and not use the cafeteria.

1394
01:44:01,910 --> 01:44:02,970
We've done it that way before.

1395
01:44:03,010 --> 01:44:06,991
And so people can actually come in the other door.

1396
01:44:07,432 --> 01:44:08,052
Okay.

1397
01:44:08,092 --> 01:44:08,712
Yeah.

1398
01:44:08,772 --> 01:44:11,073
It's not just one.

1399
01:44:12,173 --> 01:44:15,354
Um, when do kindergarteners go back to school?

1400
01:44:17,154 --> 01:44:19,195
Uh, beginning September 5th.

1401
01:44:21,316 --> 01:44:23,336
Um, beginning September 5th.

1402
01:44:23,396 --> 01:44:25,677
And the day that we're talking about is September 4th.

1403
01:44:26,461 --> 01:44:27,362
correct.

1404
01:44:28,343 --> 01:44:33,607
Have we set the voting machines up in the kindergartners, kindergartens at all at the Brooks?

1405
01:44:34,548 --> 01:44:35,168
At the Brooks.

1406
01:44:35,869 --> 01:44:39,131
Yeah, because I mean, if you can think of, is there a way just to isolate?

1407
01:44:39,171 --> 01:44:41,393
I'm just looking at a way to isolate.

1408
01:44:41,453 --> 01:44:44,836
It's a much higher voting poll location.

1409
01:44:47,598 --> 01:44:47,998
Just is.

1410
01:44:48,018 --> 01:44:49,520
It's fact.

1411
01:44:52,228 --> 01:44:58,030
Why don't we give it some more thought and at least the first day is set in stone in any event.

1412
01:44:58,230 --> 01:45:05,393
I think the rest of the calendar, I think that the only question that we have a concern about is September 4th and how to deal with that.

1413
01:45:05,993 --> 01:45:08,054
I guess for you it impacts the other day, though.

1414
01:45:09,174 --> 01:45:09,654
Can we hold it?

1415
01:45:11,855 --> 01:45:13,475
Whatever you want to do, OK?

1416
01:45:13,956 --> 01:45:20,938
Again, if you want to delay and take a look at it, we want to talk more about the election, having the 4th off rather than the March date.

1417
01:45:21,443 --> 01:45:28,224
We can do that, or we can perhaps just put the calendar out and say that the PD day is to be determined.

1418
01:45:29,124 --> 01:45:32,265
Put one as November, the November day, the second to be determined.

1419
01:45:32,745 --> 01:45:34,885
We could do that in lieu of doing nothing.

1420
01:45:34,905 --> 01:45:38,326
Okay?

1421
01:45:39,346 --> 01:45:42,267
Okay, so I'm going to take out March 11th right now.

1422
01:45:42,287 --> 01:45:47,487
I'm gonna keep in the November day, and then the second PD day will be to be determined.

1423
01:45:47,867 --> 01:45:50,868
And with that change, then we have approval to get it out.

1424
01:45:56,616 --> 01:45:57,377
Mr. Benedetto.

1425
01:45:58,558 --> 01:46:03,341
Beverly, could you provide us the last day of school for this school year?

1426
01:46:03,921 --> 01:46:08,505
I saw some people asking that and I just want to put that out to the community.

1427
01:46:09,926 --> 01:46:13,548
I know we could possibly have more snow days, hopefully not this week.

1428
01:46:13,949 --> 01:46:14,489
Very soon.

1429
01:46:17,890 --> 01:46:18,531
do that.

1430
01:46:18,851 --> 01:46:21,875
Some of our teachers are doing snow dances as we speak.

1431
01:46:22,396 --> 01:46:23,217
I'm sure everyone is.

1432
01:46:24,558 --> 01:46:27,662
I believe it's relatively early as we look at the calendar.

1433
01:46:27,682 --> 01:46:29,825
Diane, do you recall on the 18th, perhaps 19th?

1434
01:46:29,905 --> 01:46:31,968
It seems pretty early.

1435
01:46:33,867 --> 01:46:35,790
But we will get that date again.

1436
01:46:35,870 --> 01:46:37,212
This week's snow is predicted.

1437
01:46:37,332 --> 01:46:38,534
So we don't know how that's going to go.

1438
01:46:38,954 --> 01:46:39,155
Right.

1439
01:46:39,315 --> 01:46:47,447
And maybe even on the website or on the blog, an updated calendar be presented because I know some people are already planning.

1440
01:46:47,849 --> 01:46:48,590
some of vacations.

1441
01:46:48,650 --> 01:46:51,973
I think I saw it out there on Facebook or some social media thing.

1442
01:46:51,993 --> 01:46:53,334
Still within the snow days.

1443
01:46:53,474 --> 01:46:55,696
So we have the date that's online.

1444
01:46:55,837 --> 01:46:56,677
What date is it, Michael?

1445
01:46:56,697 --> 01:46:58,219
It's going to be Thursday, the 8th.

1446
01:46:58,239 --> 01:47:01,722
It doesn't look like we're going to get snow according to the forecast.

1447
01:47:01,762 --> 01:47:03,203
No, the last day of school for this year.

1448
01:47:03,824 --> 01:47:04,244
June.

1449
01:47:05,225 --> 01:47:05,886
The 18th.

1450
01:47:06,046 --> 01:47:07,127
Isn't it?

1451
01:47:07,147 --> 01:47:07,127
17, 18.

1452
01:47:08,068 --> 01:47:09,149
Who can get it the quickest?

1453
01:47:09,429 --> 01:47:10,871
We never get out, so we don't know.

1454
01:47:13,760 --> 01:47:15,722
But right now, we're within the days.

1455
01:47:15,923 --> 01:47:20,188
So the end date is, it could only be a little earlier, but it probably won't be.

1456
01:47:22,330 --> 01:47:23,412
Two, I believe.

1457
01:47:23,432 --> 01:47:24,153
I don't know.

1458
01:47:24,653 --> 01:47:25,214
I think it's two.

1459
01:47:25,574 --> 01:47:26,335
Two, only two?

1460
01:47:26,516 --> 01:47:26,996
Two.

1461
01:47:27,176 --> 01:47:28,698
There were cold days, no snow days.

1462
01:47:28,818 --> 01:47:29,439
Right.

1463
01:47:29,840 --> 01:47:30,020
Yeah.

1464
01:47:30,701 --> 01:47:31,762
They were January, right?

1465
01:47:31,782 --> 01:47:32,263
Yeah.

1466
01:47:33,131 --> 01:47:43,805
Okay, there's a motion on the floor to accept the calendar for the 18-19 school year subject to the Professional Development Day being withdrawn from March and to be determined at a later date.

1467
01:47:44,646 --> 01:47:46,208
There's a motion on the floor by Ms.

1468
01:47:46,228 --> 01:47:47,090
Stone, seconded by Ms.

1469
01:47:47,130 --> 01:47:47,370
Kretsch.

1470
01:47:47,450 --> 01:47:48,231
Roll call vote, please.

1471
01:47:48,732 --> 01:47:48,972
Yes.

1472
01:47:58,035 --> 01:47:59,917
Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1473
01:47:59,957 --> 01:48:00,597
Motion passes.

1474
01:48:01,258 --> 01:48:04,542
Recommendation to approve grant from Exxon Mobil to the Brooks School.

1475
01:48:04,562 --> 01:48:06,964
I'm sorry, Ms.

1476
01:48:07,004 --> 01:48:07,304
Kretz?

1477
01:48:15,054 --> 01:48:16,134
Is it on the agenda?

1478
01:48:19,675 --> 01:48:26,417
Open meeting law requires something to be on the agenda that we can't deliberate outside of open meeting law.

1479
01:48:26,777 --> 01:48:28,517
We can certainly listen, but we can't deliberate.

1480
01:48:28,537 --> 01:48:34,699
I'm fine with that.

1481
01:48:34,739 --> 01:48:37,240
Can we, is there anyone here from the Brooks school for this grant?

1482
01:48:38,480 --> 01:48:38,780
Diane.

1483
01:48:41,400 --> 01:48:43,081
This is the last main item then.

1484
01:48:44,202 --> 01:48:45,583
Recommendation to approve the grant.

1485
01:48:46,243 --> 01:48:51,907
It's two $500 checks, one from Alliance and one from McSheffrey Service Station.

1486
01:48:52,848 --> 01:48:56,730
Alliance wanted the Brooks School to spend the money on math and science materials.

1487
01:48:57,031 --> 01:49:00,793
Of course, we'd have to speak to Mr. Cieri and Ms.

1488
01:49:00,833 --> 01:49:02,394
Joy about the different materials.

1489
01:49:03,075 --> 01:49:06,177
And McSheffrey's just wanted to match the grant.

1490
01:49:06,377 --> 01:49:07,358
Oh, that's nice.

1491
01:49:08,097 --> 01:49:08,598
Thank you, Sir.

1492
01:49:08,658 --> 01:49:12,702
Motion for approval by Miss Mustone, seconded by Miss Van de Kloot.

1493
01:49:12,742 --> 01:49:13,603
Roll call vote, please.

1494
01:49:13,623 --> 01:49:18,348
Yes, 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

1495
01:49:18,368 --> 01:49:20,110
The grant is accepted.

1496
01:49:28,656 --> 01:49:31,997
There's a motion to revert to community participation.

1497
01:49:32,897 --> 01:49:42,759
Just for those in the audience, open meeting law requires that any types of items be on a calendar so that those that are interested in coming to a meeting know what we're going to talk about.

1498
01:49:42,779 --> 01:49:47,800
The items should be clear enough that people can figure out what is going to be the topic.

1499
01:49:48,340 --> 01:49:49,840
So at this point in time, Ms.

1500
01:49:49,860 --> 01:49:54,121
Kretz has asked that we entertain some people from the public that would like to speak on a topic.

1501
01:49:54,861 --> 01:49:57,502
We will not be deliberating, but we certainly will listen for

1502
01:49:58,041 --> 01:49:58,581
They're required.

1503
01:50:01,084 --> 01:50:07,028
Hi, thank you for hearing us out of order.

1504
01:50:07,749 --> 01:50:11,432
And we're going to be speaking on a topic that I think some of you all are already familiar with.

1505
01:50:11,492 --> 01:50:20,760
Heather Rumenap had asked us to come and speak on behalf of some parents who were concerned about adding some administrators to support to both middle schools.

1506
01:50:21,413 --> 01:50:22,694
So my name's Michelle McGonigal.

1507
01:50:22,754 --> 01:50:28,056
I have a daughter who's in the 12th grade and went to the Andrews when Mr. DeLava was quite new.

1508
01:50:28,796 --> 01:50:31,177
And I have Becca Chanahan, who's a seventh grader there now.

1509
01:50:32,078 --> 01:50:41,381
I'm also speaking as a longtime social worker who provides clinical as well as programmatic consultation to schools in Boston.

1510
01:50:42,082 --> 01:50:47,604
And also, I work for Wodeco Children's Services, which also provided support to the Medford schools.

1511
01:50:47,824 --> 01:50:48,925
So I'm speaking.

1512
01:50:50,190 --> 01:51:03,573
on behalf of a group of parents who would like to offer some opinions and suggestions, we understand you can't deliberate around this, in regards to offering support to both middle schools.

1513
01:51:06,213 --> 01:51:12,994
I just have known Paul DeLeva through the years and respect and appreciate his leadership and his skill and his capacity.

1514
01:51:14,255 --> 01:51:15,515
I also respect his

1515
01:51:17,087 --> 01:51:21,190
desire to help where needed and when needed and putting it all in.

1516
01:51:21,210 --> 01:51:30,038
I also know that we have a habit of putting more on our administrators who are so competent.

1517
01:51:31,098 --> 01:51:34,601
And I would wish that, I want to sort of address three things.

1518
01:51:36,163 --> 01:51:42,027
As we try to figure out how we can support the McGlynn in this time of transition and change,

1519
01:51:44,127 --> 01:52:09,646
I think it makes sense that the leadership at the Andrews remain consistent and stronger, and that to take some of Mr. DeLeva's time and to have it go daily over to the McGlynn, as well as offering support around MCAS, seems to sort of be a misuse of administrative leadership when I think we need more, not less, in both schools.

1520
01:52:10,126 --> 01:52:12,068
And I'm wondering if we can perhaps think of

1521
01:52:12,578 --> 01:52:13,439
some alternatives.

1522
01:52:14,340 --> 01:52:33,236
If we have two administrators at the Andrews and two, I think, vice principals are at the McGlynn right now, could we add a third administrator, either from central office or either from the, one of the suggestions was, I think, Ian Charles, who's the ninth grade headmaster, who knows the McGlynn.

1523
01:52:33,556 --> 01:52:39,261
Could he be fulfilling some interim administrative facilities there?

1524
01:52:39,761 --> 01:52:40,322
To add more,

1525
01:52:41,066 --> 01:52:43,487
sort of just splitting the difference between the two schools.

1526
01:52:44,087 --> 01:52:49,929
I think those are my main concerns and some of the suggestions from the other parents.

1527
01:52:54,910 --> 01:53:02,953
Because I think the basic sort of understanding is to increase the help and the need

1528
01:53:04,013 --> 01:53:08,155
as we want to make sure there's safety and stability moving forward to the end of the year.

1529
01:53:08,535 --> 01:53:10,256
And it's a short-term problem to solve.

1530
01:53:11,196 --> 01:53:21,560
I also think that if you add another administrator from outside, you also have more voices and more perspective on what might be needed moving forward into next year.

1531
01:53:21,900 --> 01:53:23,521
So those were my three suggestions.

1532
01:53:23,581 --> 01:53:23,901
Thank you.

1533
01:53:25,242 --> 01:53:26,582
Hi, I'm Maria Daniels.

1534
01:53:26,622 --> 01:53:28,523
I have two sons at the Andrews Middle School.

1535
01:53:29,350 --> 01:53:42,358
here speaking both to back Michelle up, and she's an expert in this, so I don't know if that came across, but she spends every day in schools dealing with a lot of issues and really knows what she's talking about.

1536
01:53:42,858 --> 01:53:51,203
I think from my perspective and the perspective of other parents that I've spoken with, we really feel it's a mistake to weaken one school, just try to fix a problem elsewhere.

1537
01:53:51,484 --> 01:53:54,466
And Mr. DeLeva is highly competent.

1538
01:53:54,586 --> 01:53:56,827
He's called upon by a lot of people to help

1539
01:53:57,811 --> 01:54:01,294
outside of his duties already, and I admire that, and I respect that.

1540
01:54:02,035 --> 01:54:10,722
I really think that no matter the leader's capabilities, removing the leader or distributing his time this way is weakening the school.

1541
01:54:11,502 --> 01:54:22,512
If it were like a few weeks in June, if we were at June 1st and talking about this, I might feel a little differently, but the truth is we have a significant amount of the school year left, about two-fifths of the school year.

1542
01:54:23,112 --> 01:54:24,773
So we're just here to express that.

1543
01:54:24,833 --> 01:54:26,595
Thank you for listening and for your time.

1544
01:54:27,838 --> 01:54:28,278
Thank you.

1545
01:54:29,439 --> 01:54:30,219
Mr. D'Oliva.

1546
01:54:33,720 --> 01:54:34,641
You have to excuse me.

1547
01:54:34,661 --> 01:54:35,981
I'm a little under the weather.

1548
01:54:37,322 --> 01:54:41,363
So I'll just do this kind of thing, virtual.

1549
01:54:41,423 --> 01:54:42,744
Someone told me virtual handshake.

1550
01:54:45,324 --> 01:54:49,866
Just so I can respond, I want to, first of all, I'm very humbled and flattered.

1551
01:54:49,886 --> 01:54:55,728
So thank you very much for the confidence that the community has in me.

1552
01:54:55,748 --> 01:54:57,269
I appreciate the,

1553
01:54:57,825 --> 01:55:00,087
the sentiments and everything like that.

1554
01:55:00,327 --> 01:55:07,492
But as I've said before, and I think if you've known me through my career, I've always said, I will go where Medford needs me.

1555
01:55:07,672 --> 01:55:09,614
If Medford needs me somewhere, I will be there.

1556
01:55:09,694 --> 01:55:19,821
And I think that's sort of my mantra, and I've always said it, whether I was a student teacher, or a teacher, or a coach, or however my career has moved up.

1557
01:55:20,682 --> 01:55:24,624
And at this point in time, I know Medford needs me in a certain way.

1558
01:55:25,908 --> 01:55:32,973
The one thing I do want to reiterate is that McGlynn is going to be doing MCAS online, the whole school.

1559
01:55:34,054 --> 01:55:44,482
And I have that skill set to help guide that school in that direction because, as the superintendent has said before, if one school fails, we all fail.

1560
01:55:44,923 --> 01:55:48,345
And that's something I don't want to see happen here in Medford.

1561
01:55:49,736 --> 01:55:55,018
But I do want to also state I appreciate that everybody's looking out for me in so many ways.

1562
01:55:58,099 --> 01:55:59,820
But I can do it.

1563
01:56:00,720 --> 01:56:01,160
I can do it.

1564
01:56:03,281 --> 01:56:05,802
But I respect my families.

1565
01:56:05,882 --> 01:56:08,263
My families are, you know, this is why I do what I do.

1566
01:56:09,243 --> 01:56:11,084
It's not just being with the kids.

1567
01:56:11,124 --> 01:56:12,764
I love being with the kids every single day.

1568
01:56:12,784 --> 01:56:16,286
It's meeting wonderful families, getting different perspectives.

1569
01:56:18,072 --> 01:56:21,013
moving everything forward in a direction where we're working as a whole.

1570
01:56:22,694 --> 01:56:26,936
So I just wanted to state that as well, that I am very humbled.

1571
01:56:27,016 --> 01:56:30,758
I'm very humbled that people are here speaking on my behalf.

1572
01:56:31,752 --> 01:56:40,574
But I just wanted to let those points be known that I'd really like my focus to be on the MCAS for both schools because, again, if one school fails, then we all fail.

1573
01:56:40,754 --> 01:56:41,454
So thank you.

1574
01:56:41,874 --> 01:56:43,134
Thank you, Mr. DeLeva.

1575
01:56:45,054 --> 01:56:47,335
No deliberations.

1576
01:56:47,635 --> 01:56:49,915
May I just add to that or just respond to that?

1577
01:56:49,955 --> 01:56:52,296
I'm not here really to look out for Mr. DeLeva.

1578
01:56:52,816 --> 01:56:56,876
I'm here to look out for my children, my two sons that are there at the Andrews School every day.

1579
01:56:57,457 --> 01:56:59,877
And I feel like if you remove an administrator,

1580
01:57:00,574 --> 01:57:02,996
you're making that school more vulnerable, period.

1581
01:57:15,966 --> 01:57:26,093
They would just send in an email through the superintendent's office, and just like Melanie's item got on for CPAC, we put an item right on that says what you're going to be talking about.

1582
01:57:26,113 --> 01:57:26,854
It's that simple.

1583
01:57:29,565 --> 01:57:30,405
Miss Van De Kloot.

1584
01:57:30,606 --> 01:57:39,691
Technically, it's supposed to come in by Wednesday, by noon, although I know that there is a certain amount of leeway that's usually granted.

1585
01:57:40,431 --> 01:57:51,117
But just people need to be aware that our packets are received on Friday, so that it, you know, they can't come in at Friday at 5 and expect it to go out to us in a timely manner.

1586
01:57:53,109 --> 01:57:54,349
Thank you for the clarification.

1587
01:57:54,429 --> 01:58:05,053
Perhaps there could be a form developed that's on the website that someone can just fill in and hit send and give the deadlines and whatnot.

1588
01:58:06,094 --> 01:58:12,296
If we could move negotiations and legal matters to the end of the calendar on the motion, Mr. Ruggiero, seconded by Ms.

1589
01:58:12,336 --> 01:58:12,636
Kretz.

1590
01:58:12,756 --> 01:58:12,976
Yes.

1591
01:58:13,316 --> 01:58:13,996
All those in favor?

1592
01:58:14,016 --> 01:58:14,497
Aye.

1593
01:58:14,617 --> 01:58:15,337
All those opposed?

1594
01:58:16,972 --> 01:58:18,613
New business, school committee resolution.

1595
01:58:18,633 --> 01:58:23,475
Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Irene Anestis.

1596
01:58:23,935 --> 01:58:27,996
Mrs. Anestis was the former secretary for the School Buildings and Grounds Department.

1597
01:58:28,897 --> 01:58:33,138
Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Tilly Fodey.

1598
01:58:33,619 --> 01:58:37,060
Mrs. Fodey was a long-time Medford resident and Medford High School secretary.

1599
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:42,522
And be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Joe Small.

1600
01:58:42,922 --> 01:58:48,805
Mr. Small was a retired Medford firefighter and father of Robert Small, former teacher at the vocational school.

1601
01:58:49,345 --> 01:58:50,946
If we could all rise for a moment of silence.

1602
01:59:00,451 --> 01:59:00,791
Thank you.

1603
01:59:03,732 --> 01:59:04,933
Also under new business,

1604
01:59:06,664 --> 01:59:14,735
Be it resolved that the Memphis School Committee review its current policies and practices on school rentals and take actions as deemed necessary to enhance the safety and security of our schools.

1605
01:59:16,048 --> 01:59:23,951
As we realize, I think this is something that's going to need a broader conversation, perhaps in a subcommittee, to determine how we want to move forward.

1606
01:59:24,412 --> 01:59:38,617
Over the past two weekends, we have canceled, for the most part, events at our outlying schools, not the high school, but our McGlynn, Andrews, and Brooks school for rentals that have been occurring in the interest of safety.

1607
01:59:38,817 --> 01:59:42,699
And also, we have been putting so many resources into the high school that

1608
01:59:43,306 --> 01:59:45,830
There was just no way we could cover all four.

1609
01:59:46,631 --> 01:59:57,448
So we need to make decisions on whether or not we want to reopen these schools, if we want to add on a detail rate to the form, so that anyone that would like to rent the

1610
01:59:58,150 --> 02:00:06,152
The facilities, there is a cost above and beyond the rental fee that covers coverage, whether it be a detail or security presence.

1611
02:00:06,932 --> 02:00:14,894
So we need to figure out those things that we can move forward with our rental program or cease rentals altogether.

1612
02:00:14,914 --> 02:00:25,377
So that certainly is a call that the school committee needs to make and assumption that can, from a security standpoint, it could be discussed in executive session as well if we wanted to discuss security measures.

1613
02:00:28,726 --> 02:00:36,092
I'd like to make a motion, if in fact it's allowed, to close the superintendent search survey this Friday.

1614
02:00:36,152 --> 02:00:46,062
We've never discussed an actual end date, but of course the search committee will struggle to analyze the data if we actually don't turn it off.

1615
02:00:47,157 --> 02:00:55,359
So I don't know if that's... So applications, the deadline was February 28th, so applications are closed from anyone wishing to apply.

1616
02:00:56,239 --> 02:01:03,381
Questions have been developed and tomorrow night are actually going to be finalized by the search committee, so certainly the survey should be cut off.

1617
02:01:03,781 --> 02:01:04,021
Okay.

1618
02:01:05,641 --> 02:01:12,603
If you could just make a note that... I know, we were talking about this and we shifted gears.

1619
02:01:15,170 --> 02:01:18,713
We need to give guidance to community schools on the rental situation.

1620
02:01:18,733 --> 02:01:18,833
So, Ms.

1621
02:01:18,993 --> 02:01:20,855
Van de Kloot.

1622
02:01:21,468 --> 02:01:22,088
Yes, Mayor Burke.

1623
02:01:22,128 --> 02:01:28,910
I'm a little bit troubled just how, um, when we just had people before us, we wanted to be clear that we couldn't deliberate on that.

1624
02:01:29,050 --> 02:01:30,710
This was actually on the agenda.

1625
02:01:30,770 --> 02:01:32,470
It just didn't reprint it.

1626
02:01:32,510 --> 02:01:32,750
No, no.

1627
02:01:32,790 --> 02:01:34,191
But I just wanted to add a sentence.

1628
02:01:34,251 --> 02:01:37,471
I think that I would have added earlier if I had realized that we're going to walk away at that point.

1629
02:01:37,511 --> 02:01:44,933
But, um, I just, it just the fact that we have it deliberated on it doesn't mean that we didn't hear the parents and their concerns.

1630
02:01:45,293 --> 02:01:46,793
And that's an important distinction to make.

1631
02:01:46,833 --> 02:01:48,934
Certainly we've been C receiving emails.

1632
02:01:49,334 --> 02:01:50,414
I think that we're, um,

1633
02:01:52,821 --> 02:02:07,152
that we're, I'm sure that every school committee member, if I can dare to speak for the body, is concerned about this issue and waiting to, we can't make a decision here or whatever, but I think that there's,

1634
02:02:09,410 --> 02:02:14,773
that I would like to say that I heard them and have heard from parents.

1635
02:02:16,974 --> 02:02:24,938
And if there is a better solution or whatnot, I'm sure that's something that we might take up at a different point.

1636
02:02:25,838 --> 02:02:26,139
OK?

1637
02:02:27,599 --> 02:02:28,040
Thank you, Ms.

1638
02:02:28,060 --> 02:02:28,400
Vandermeer.

1639
02:02:30,321 --> 02:02:32,802
Mr. Rousseau.

1640
02:02:32,862 --> 02:02:36,284
I'm sorry.

1641
02:02:37,724 --> 02:02:40,205
I'm certainly, I think this is important that we do this.

1642
02:02:40,245 --> 02:02:43,367
I would just like to have a report that we can have.

1643
02:02:43,447 --> 02:02:48,649
So I'd like to know how much money we generate from these rentals, how large the groups are.

1644
02:02:48,669 --> 02:02:54,732
I think that I would like to suggest that we have a committee of the whole meeting with just this particular issue is discussed.

1645
02:02:54,772 --> 02:02:56,353
We have all the paperwork before us.

1646
02:02:56,393 --> 02:02:57,273
We can have the research.

1647
02:02:57,835 --> 02:03:10,079
But for me, I need to know what are the groups that are currently renting, how much income we receive from these groups, and the size of every one of these groups, whether it's the Impact Church, how many members they usually receive on what days.

1648
02:03:10,099 --> 02:03:14,441
I would say one case, it's a soccer program at the Brooks School.

1649
02:03:14,721 --> 02:03:17,002
It's a basketball program at the Andrews School.

1650
02:03:17,222 --> 02:03:19,963
It's a church group at the McGlynn School.

1651
02:03:20,768 --> 02:03:26,891
Mr. Maloney, is that about the size of the outside rentals at the non-high school locations?

1652
02:03:27,311 --> 02:03:29,272
There's a senior group at the pool, right?

1653
02:03:29,652 --> 02:03:32,454
We're not talking about the high school facility.

1654
02:03:38,196 --> 02:03:40,217
Not high school, I see, I see, okay.

1655
02:03:40,537 --> 02:03:43,559
Good evening, Bobby Maloney, Sheridan Ave.

1656
02:03:43,599 --> 02:03:44,699
Metfit.

1657
02:03:44,759 --> 02:03:47,641
Columbus School, we have a night volleyball league on Wednesdays.

1658
02:03:52,625 --> 02:03:56,267
The McGlynn School, we have Impact Church on Sundays.

1659
02:04:00,670 --> 02:04:04,312
The McGlynn School is done for youth basketball as of tonight.

1660
02:04:07,894 --> 02:04:10,635
The Roberts has one more night of basketball, which is tonight.

1661
02:04:11,696 --> 02:04:12,356
Roberts?

1662
02:04:12,376 --> 02:04:12,937
Roberts School.

1663
02:04:13,617 --> 02:04:14,538
Roberts, not Andrews.

1664
02:04:15,258 --> 02:04:16,479
Roberts does have some.

1665
02:04:19,741 --> 02:04:19,821
Yep.

1666
02:04:19,861 --> 02:04:20,161
Andrews?

1667
02:04:21,368 --> 02:04:24,470
Andrews Middle School has one more practice basketball Thursday night.

1668
02:04:29,654 --> 02:04:31,696
And then you got the high school, which is going 24-7.

1669
02:04:31,756 --> 02:04:36,279
So the big thing, I need some guidance on Impact Church.

1670
02:04:37,460 --> 02:04:40,362
I mean, they've been a fantastic renter for the last two and a half years.

1671
02:04:41,963 --> 02:04:43,024
They're good in the community.

1672
02:04:43,605 --> 02:04:45,906
They're good with the McGlynn Middle School and Elementary School.

1673
02:04:47,087 --> 02:04:49,329
They need some guidance whether they need to find a new home.

1674
02:04:49,935 --> 02:04:53,418
They've been going week to week and been very patient, so.

1675
02:04:53,919 --> 02:04:55,840
And they're willing to pay police details.

1676
02:04:55,860 --> 02:04:57,502
They're willing to put on a police detail.

1677
02:04:57,522 --> 02:04:58,163
Multiple.

1678
02:04:58,323 --> 02:04:58,643
Yep.

1679
02:04:59,604 --> 02:05:15,819
So my recommendation would be to have them come back with a police detail or multiple details and be happy to sit down with the committee and the committee of the whole and you guys can give us some policy changes or some guidance on what you want to do with the outside schools.

1680
02:05:21,599 --> 02:05:22,359
Mr. Benedetto.

1681
02:05:22,679 --> 02:05:23,019
Thank you.

1682
02:05:23,619 --> 02:05:32,383
Um, Bob, you might not know this, but, um, do you know how much we in revenue we get from the impact church or any of these programs?

1683
02:05:32,764 --> 02:05:38,866
I believe it's, uh, the impact church is about 800 and I can get you the definite answer.

1684
02:05:39,287 --> 02:05:46,870
And when I look on their, um, social media sites, they're not just in the auditorium, they're throughout the building.

1685
02:05:47,450 --> 02:05:49,151
At least that's pitches they have posted.

1686
02:05:50,643 --> 02:05:54,065
They use the gym twice a year for annual events for the kids.

1687
02:05:55,126 --> 02:05:58,008
Generally they're in the cafeteria and they're also in the theater.

1688
02:05:58,568 --> 02:06:00,169
They should not be anywhere else in the building.

1689
02:06:00,630 --> 02:06:05,593
Sometimes they go for long weekends or vacations, they store some stuff in the music room that's right next to the theater.

1690
02:06:06,494 --> 02:06:07,915
But other than that, they shouldn't be anywhere.

1691
02:06:14,878 --> 02:06:30,847
There's a motion to send paper, but Mr. Maloney needs guidance for this upcoming weekend because I pretty much, we've been arbitrarily, not arbitrarily, we've been deciding that until we have a handle on the outside schools that we won't have outside vendors that are coming in.

1692
02:06:33,269 --> 02:06:33,409
Ms.

1693
02:06:33,429 --> 02:06:33,849
Mustone.

1694
02:06:34,429 --> 02:06:42,314
I just want to say that the pastor's wife has four small children, three of them are at the Roberts, and they do a ton of

1695
02:06:43,723 --> 02:06:44,123
Mayor Burke.

1696
02:06:44,584 --> 02:06:45,004
Mr. Benedetto.

1697
02:06:45,024 --> 02:06:45,264
Thank you.

1698
02:06:45,284 --> 02:06:46,225
I second the motion of Mr. Ruggiero.

1699
02:07:11,887 --> 02:07:27,871
only because we don't have any answers, we don't know where or how things have happened recently, I would just hate for anything further to happen within our community without thought and care.

1700
02:07:29,311 --> 02:07:39,734
I'd rather err on the side of being too safe right at this point than opening it up again, especially without time to really consider it and see how

1701
02:07:40,308 --> 02:07:44,789
we can move forward safely and what rules and regulations we need to put forth.

1702
02:07:44,809 --> 02:07:49,911
Um, so I second the motion on the floor.

1703
02:07:50,131 --> 02:07:54,452
Well, the motion is just, I'm sure they're lovely paper to committee of the whole, which is one motion.

1704
02:07:54,492 --> 02:08:00,373
The other item that we're talking about is the issue for this weekend because we can't just cut off one renter.

1705
02:08:00,393 --> 02:08:02,034
Uh, they have a right.

1706
02:08:03,654 --> 02:08:06,775
We can't just, we open it up to whoever has rented.

1707
02:08:07,195 --> 02:08:09,996
We can't just stop one renter from coming forward.

1708
02:08:11,101 --> 02:08:16,383
So we have to be fair and equitable about that.

1709
02:08:17,303 --> 02:08:19,124
Least detail until this issue is resolved.

1710
02:08:19,144 --> 02:08:20,625
They're willing to put two details on.

1711
02:08:22,005 --> 02:08:23,025
I'll take some guidance.

1712
02:08:23,205 --> 02:08:29,328
I know if you want them in front of the building, if you want them in the building, and I know some people are going to say, are we going to sweep the buildings?

1713
02:08:29,348 --> 02:08:31,768
They've been fantastic for here for two and a half years.

1714
02:08:31,808 --> 02:08:32,008
Yeah.

1715
02:08:32,589 --> 02:08:39,151
I mean, they're willing to put two details on until the subcommittee meets and they'll take further guidance from the committee and the superintendent's office.

1716
02:08:39,935 --> 02:08:44,576
Mayor Burke, I mean, I definitely have sympathy with the church and this is partly their home as well.

1717
02:08:45,396 --> 02:08:51,398
Um, so I, if that is acceptable to church, that's definitely acceptable to me until we can talk about this issue in more detail.

1718
02:08:51,798 --> 02:09:00,960
So I'd like to add in addition to my motion to make sure that we have police details until the committee of the whole can meet for this weekend to make sure they're responsible for at least two details.

1719
02:09:01,961 --> 02:09:02,421
Mayor Burke.

1720
02:09:02,841 --> 02:09:03,581
Mr. Panadetto.

1721
02:09:04,121 --> 02:09:06,582
Um, so,

1722
02:09:08,733 --> 02:09:24,338
Can we shut down these external schools to outside groups and not MedFed, like youth registered groups that are provided?

1723
02:09:24,378 --> 02:09:31,780
I feel more comfortable with youth basketball than I do with the outside faction.

1724
02:09:32,960 --> 02:09:37,402
There's a US Supreme Court case on allowing rentals to churches.

1725
02:09:40,994 --> 02:09:57,962
We do have a request for two weeks for the McGlynn school Bangladesh event they've been there on eight or nine occasions in the last three years They're looking to use the cat the auditorium from 3 to 11 On a Saturday coming up.

1726
02:09:58,763 --> 02:10:00,823
So I'm gonna need some guidance.

1727
02:10:01,004 --> 02:10:03,925
You either tell me to shut down or not so I

1728
02:10:04,515 --> 02:10:07,476
With the amendment added, I would withdraw my second.

1729
02:10:08,416 --> 02:10:17,597
I'm going to err on the side of safety at this point and say nobody until our committee can meet and make sure that we're safe.

1730
02:10:21,138 --> 02:10:30,699
There's a motion to send this paper to committee of the whole and also require that a police detail be present for these groups.

1731
02:10:31,279 --> 02:10:32,080
Until further notice.

1732
02:10:32,980 --> 02:10:33,520
Mayor Burke.

1733
02:10:36,737 --> 02:10:37,938
Seconded by Mr. Russo.

1734
02:10:39,259 --> 02:10:39,900
Roll call vote.

1735
02:10:41,161 --> 02:10:42,222
Mrs. DeBenedetta.

1736
02:10:42,463 --> 02:10:42,683
No.

1737
02:10:44,144 --> 02:10:44,725
Mrs. Rex.

1738
02:10:44,805 --> 02:10:44,905
Yes.

1739
02:10:47,327 --> 02:10:48,108
Mrs. Stone.

1740
02:10:49,169 --> 02:10:49,409
Yes.

1741
02:10:49,429 --> 02:10:49,950
Mr. Ritchiero.

1742
02:10:50,090 --> 02:10:50,330
Yes.

1743
02:10:51,231 --> 02:10:51,451
Mr. Russo.

1744
02:10:51,471 --> 02:10:51,551
Yes.

1745
02:10:51,591 --> 02:10:54,474
Mrs. Vanden Heuvel.

1746
02:10:55,215 --> 02:10:55,455
Yes.

1747
02:10:56,356 --> 02:10:56,716
The affirmative.

1748
02:10:57,277 --> 02:10:57,557
Yes.

1749
02:10:57,937 --> 02:10:59,579
Six in the affirmative, one in the negative.

1750
02:10:59,639 --> 02:11:00,340
Motion passes.

1751
02:11:03,464 --> 02:11:09,348
This paper will go to committee of the whole and we will schedule one as soon as we humanly can.

1752
02:11:10,228 --> 02:11:10,909
Oh, definitely.

1753
02:11:11,049 --> 02:11:11,829
Yes, definitely.

1754
02:11:12,029 --> 02:11:17,292
Just for the everybody's, uh, we have a five K road race at the high school this weekend, the run into the leprechauns.

1755
02:11:18,113 --> 02:11:23,976
There'll be two police details and a fight detail up there because we're expecting a decent crowd on Sunday up there.

1756
02:11:24,056 --> 02:11:24,336
Okay.

1757
02:11:28,058 --> 02:11:28,798
Mr. Benedetto.

1758
02:11:28,818 --> 02:11:29,599
Um,

1759
02:11:30,483 --> 02:11:38,006
Could we request that one of the detail to make sure that the group stays within the gym and outside facility and not?

1760
02:11:38,106 --> 02:11:43,127
We have two details because there's only two entrances, one into the gym and one from the outside.

1761
02:11:43,147 --> 02:11:44,468
So there'll be a cop at each door.

1762
02:11:45,108 --> 02:11:45,188
OK.

1763
02:11:45,408 --> 02:11:46,068
And they can use it.

1764
02:11:46,128 --> 02:11:50,070
I'm sure they're going to need to use the restrooms and stuff like that in that area, right?

1765
02:11:50,450 --> 02:11:50,930
By the gym.

1766
02:11:50,950 --> 02:11:51,390
By the gym.

1767
02:11:51,470 --> 02:11:53,331
So that area will be closed off.

1768
02:11:53,451 --> 02:11:55,491
And people will come in and out one door.

1769
02:11:55,511 --> 02:11:56,612
They're going to come in.

1770
02:11:56,752 --> 02:11:58,232
I think there's going to be a lot of people.

1771
02:12:00,913 --> 02:12:02,574
I just want clarification on that.

1772
02:12:02,794 --> 02:12:05,475
Thank you, Mr. Maloney.

1773
02:12:05,515 --> 02:12:08,215
I know they raise a lot of money for a good cause as well.

1774
02:12:08,476 --> 02:12:11,937
I just want to make sure our buildings are safe and secure.

1775
02:12:11,957 --> 02:12:13,837
Mr. Russo, are you blinking?

1776
02:12:13,857 --> 02:12:14,377
Are you all set?

1777
02:12:15,438 --> 02:12:16,098
Mr. Russo.

1778
02:12:16,498 --> 02:12:22,040
Do we have an estimate of what it costs to sweep each building each time we do it?

1779
02:12:23,062 --> 02:12:25,903
Well, it would be more of an overtime issue.

1780
02:12:26,443 --> 02:12:33,186
It's NMLAC, so our police department works in combination with other police communities that we're a member of.

1781
02:12:33,306 --> 02:12:36,067
And they all come in, and they bring their various dogs and whatnot.

1782
02:12:36,928 --> 02:12:41,450
So we incur overtime if it's above and beyond our office's time.

1783
02:12:42,010 --> 02:12:43,631
But we don't pay for the other communities.

1784
02:12:44,891 --> 02:12:49,093
So it depends on what time, when you're doing it, and who's on staff that day.

1785
02:12:50,133 --> 02:12:50,573
Mayor Burke.

1786
02:12:51,373 --> 02:12:52,034
Mr. Benedetto.

1787
02:12:52,274 --> 02:12:52,654
Thank you.

1788
02:12:52,814 --> 02:13:02,036
Going back to an issue that, um, my committee member brought up about closing the questionnaire.

1789
02:13:04,917 --> 02:13:05,477
The survey.

1790
02:13:05,497 --> 02:13:06,217
Yeah.

1791
02:13:06,337 --> 02:13:06,877
The survey.

1792
02:13:06,937 --> 02:13:07,438
I'm sorry.

1793
02:13:07,678 --> 02:13:08,558
It's, it's time.

1794
02:13:09,218 --> 02:13:16,140
I just had a few questions about that and about what feedback you've gotten in any updates and how that's being used to, um,

1795
02:13:18,298 --> 02:13:21,180
prepare questions for the superintendent's interview.

1796
02:13:21,220 --> 02:13:30,308
I know you did a lot of work on it, so I wanted to give it the justice and a moment to bring forward what you've learned.

1797
02:13:31,160 --> 02:13:34,961
Yeah, highlight the survey, because you had some decent results.

1798
02:13:35,121 --> 02:13:36,862
It's pretty good for a community.

1799
02:13:36,902 --> 02:13:39,703
The multiple choice questions, those are easy to give answers to.

1800
02:13:55,544 --> 02:13:57,845
I know, you're just not coming across loud, but you are on.

1801
02:13:58,326 --> 02:13:58,946
We'll close it.

1802
02:13:59,666 --> 02:14:00,267
Bring it closer.

1803
02:14:00,307 --> 02:14:05,430
So for the multiple choice questions, these are kind of easy to get answers to.

1804
02:14:06,090 --> 02:14:19,217
I will say the multiple choice questions, sort of as predicted by Glenn and Richard and Nancy, were really much less interesting than we thought we could imagine.

1805
02:14:20,058 --> 02:14:23,300
I think the hard part about this survey is that,

1806
02:14:24,423 --> 02:14:32,569
Generally speaking, the public doesn't know what a superintendent does because the superintendent does so many things.

1807
02:14:33,069 --> 02:14:41,215
And so, you know, there's a pie chart with like a gazillion little slices and almost no slice that's particularly big.

1808
02:14:41,275 --> 02:14:49,400
So, I mean, I don't have the, to close it, I'm not gonna sit down and spend days analyzing the data, because I'd have to do it all over again.

1809
02:14:49,941 --> 02:14:53,003
But what I will say is that in the open,

1810
02:15:02,363 --> 02:15:02,963
Do you want to use mine?

1811
02:15:03,343 --> 02:15:04,904
Oh, there we go.

1812
02:15:06,544 --> 02:15:10,545
Anyways, it's the open-ended questions.

1813
02:15:10,585 --> 02:15:12,645
What would you ask a new superintendent?

1814
02:15:13,826 --> 02:15:16,286
What do you think is great about Medford's public schools?

1815
02:15:17,767 --> 02:15:24,428
Those are the questions that, well, first of all, are going to require a small army of people to analyze, because people were not brief.

1816
02:15:25,428 --> 02:15:31,750
So 458 people so far have responded, and each person seems to have prepared a small novel.

1817
02:15:33,611 --> 02:15:40,497
So we'll be reading through those, which I have not done yet, and pulling out themes that come up.

1818
02:15:41,838 --> 02:15:46,642
And then once I have had the time to do that, then I will certainly present those results.

1819
02:15:48,804 --> 02:15:49,624
Very good.

1820
02:15:49,845 --> 02:15:50,145
Thank you.

1821
02:15:52,322 --> 02:15:52,742
Okay.

1822
02:15:52,842 --> 02:15:55,643
We're down to our last item, negotiations and legal matters.

1823
02:15:55,903 --> 02:16:07,448
And this is the discussion of upcoming employee negotiation strategies, discussion of security strategies and discussion of employee complaint under mass general law chapter 38 section 21 a one.

1824
02:16:08,168 --> 02:16:13,450
Is there a motion to go into executive session by Mr. Ruggiero seconded by Mr. Russo roll call vote.

1825
02:16:13,470 --> 02:16:13,610
Ms.

1826
02:16:13,650 --> 02:16:13,970
Kretz.

1827
02:16:15,411 --> 02:16:15,611
Yes.

1828
02:16:24,725 --> 02:16:26,669
Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1829
02:16:26,709 --> 02:16:27,390
Motion passes.

1830
02:16:27,430 --> 02:16:31,437
We will now enter executive session and we will convene.

1831
02:16:31,457 --> 02:16:35,403
We'll come out of executive session to complete the meeting.

1832
02:16:35,704 --> 02:16:37,026
We will not reconvene in this room.
