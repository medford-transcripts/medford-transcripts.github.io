8
00:00:52,328 --> 00:01:00,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Our agenda tonight is be it resolved that the strategic and capital planning committee will meet to review and update the district's capital needs assessment and planning document.

9
00:01:01,235 --> 00:01:05,659
[SPEAKER_02]: Be it further resolved that the subcommittee will devise a process to ensure regular annual maintenance of the plan.

10
00:01:06,259 --> 00:01:12,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Be it also resolved that the subcommittee will provide a report to the full school committee no later than June 10th, 2024.

11
00:01:13,525 --> 00:01:14,566
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll call the roll.

12
00:01:15,567 --> 00:01:16,167
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Russo.

13
00:01:16,187 --> 00:01:16,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Present.

14
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:18,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Reinfeldt.

15
00:01:18,048 --> 00:01:18,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Present.

16
00:01:18,628 --> 00:01:19,389
[SPEAKER_02]: And Member Graham.

17
00:01:19,629 --> 00:01:19,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Present.

18
00:01:20,109 --> 00:01:22,710
[SPEAKER_02]: So three presents are absent.

19
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:23,590
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we are.

20
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:25,330
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can have that back.

21
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:40,655
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think actually what might make sense is for us to talk about the process first in terms of like how to ensure that we are doing, that we are sort of getting back, I'll say getting back to post-COVID.

22
00:01:44,197 --> 00:02:03,596
[SPEAKER_02]: a more routine and I'll say rigorous process around capital planning to try to have like an ongoing roadmap that anticipates what those big needs are so that we can be communicating with our partners in city government what those upcoming needs are, what we think that they might be, et cetera.

23
00:02:05,286 --> 00:02:13,188
[SPEAKER_02]: And those things for which we would be wanting or needing capital funding to be able to complete the process.

24
00:02:13,228 --> 00:02:17,670
[SPEAKER_02]: So before COVID, there was a process.

25
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:21,971
[SPEAKER_02]: It has changed over time, so there was a process.

26
00:02:24,265 --> 00:02:32,469
[SPEAKER_02]: back right before COVID, I guess I would say maybe in the preceding year where like a sort of a four-year chart that looks like this was produced.

27
00:02:33,329 --> 00:02:46,756
[SPEAKER_02]: And it listed each of the buildings and what on a year-by-year basis was on the capital like roadmap for that building and sort of estimates of what was being accounted for.

28
00:02:47,976 --> 00:02:58,982
[SPEAKER_02]: And then during COVID, our process actually sort of got absorbed into the City of Medford's capital improvement plan, which is this document.

29
00:03:00,542 --> 00:03:07,706
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a number of things from a school perspective in this document as well.

30
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:12,348
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just trying to find the page that talks about some of those things.

31
00:03:13,108 --> 00:03:15,449
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, Graham, this was produced by the Collins Center, correct?

32
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:16,490
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct, yes.

33
00:03:21,986 --> 00:03:28,411
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's see, we have school.

34
00:03:28,451 --> 00:03:34,175
[SPEAKER_02]: This report outlined 27 projects for the schools at a cost of 12.4% of the total costs outlined.

35
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:53,211
[SPEAKER_02]: total anticipated cost of $60 million and a percentage of total costs being 35%.

36
00:03:55,472 --> 00:04:02,073
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a whole lot of information about what those 27 projects are that were outlined at the time.

37
00:04:02,173 --> 00:04:12,035
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the time is right for us as a school committee to sort of take back the ownership of tracking all of that.

38
00:04:12,115 --> 00:04:12,795
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think

39
00:04:13,775 --> 00:04:25,831
[SPEAKER_02]: That is true, especially because we now have an electronic ticketing system for all of our maintenance projects and requests across the district.

40
00:04:26,052 --> 00:04:30,377
[SPEAKER_02]: So work orders can be put into a formal tracking system that I think

41
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:38,484
[SPEAKER_02]: can maybe help us sort of make light work of what these capital requests are so that we can then put them on the roadmap.

42
00:04:38,584 --> 00:04:52,114
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Dr. Cushing, I was hoping you could tell us a little bit about how that system is working versus like what we used to do, which was a ticketing system of sorts, you know, but via email and much harder to sort of report and track.

43
00:04:52,134 --> 00:04:52,474
[SPEAKER_02]: So what

44
00:04:52,974 --> 00:04:54,895
[SPEAKER_02]: what kind of capabilities do we have today?

45
00:04:54,915 --> 00:04:58,677
[SPEAKER_05]: So we now have the system is known as operations hero.

46
00:05:00,298 --> 00:05:08,462
[SPEAKER_05]: And it is a full service ticketing system for both custodial, for maintenance and technology if we want.

47
00:05:08,582 --> 00:05:12,123
[SPEAKER_05]: Presently, we're running our ticketing for technology under a separate system.

48
00:05:12,964 --> 00:05:14,945
[SPEAKER_05]: But we're gonna see how this system works to be able to merge.

49
00:05:15,225 --> 00:05:21,328
[SPEAKER_05]: But as far as custodial and maintenance, what happens now is we're having principals

50
00:05:22,148 --> 00:05:25,350
[SPEAKER_05]: and assistant principals and directors enter.

51
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:36,756
[SPEAKER_05]: We were worried, I was worried about just opening the ticketing system up to every employee in the district, that it would be flooded immediately with everybody's concern from the lowest to the highest need.

52
00:05:37,156 --> 00:05:42,679
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was worried about the ability to filter what was high priority.

53
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,100
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're doing essentially a soft open.

54
00:05:46,281 --> 00:05:49,483
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have about 40 tickets in right now.

55
00:05:50,263 --> 00:06:01,332
[SPEAKER_05]: ranging from roof leaks to fixing broken water filling stations to a number of other issues that are coming up.

56
00:06:01,392 --> 00:06:12,321
[SPEAKER_05]: We have training scheduled for our maintenance staff because what's really nice about this ticketing system is as we install new equipment and as we maintain existing equipment,

57
00:06:13,001 --> 00:06:25,232
[SPEAKER_05]: We can put QR codes on them so the equipment will have a life cycle so that we'll be able to see the maintenance history of every piece of equipment and every district asset as we move forward.

58
00:06:26,133 --> 00:06:28,455
[SPEAKER_05]: And we will be able to start pulling reports from them.

59
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:33,980
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one of my trainings that's scheduled for upcoming.

60
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

61
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:34,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

62
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,103
[SPEAKER_06]: So did you not list custodians?

63
00:06:37,987 --> 00:06:38,728
[SPEAKER_05]: Not yet.

64
00:06:38,988 --> 00:06:54,844
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, because they just seem like a group that... Yeah, we're going to start with senior custodians who then can distribute the work to junior custodians and make sure as their contract states that it's well organized and distributed fairly.

65
00:06:55,084 --> 00:06:58,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Not just my experience, but custodians actually run into a lot of things.

66
00:06:59,289 --> 00:06:59,489
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

67
00:07:00,089 --> 00:07:01,051
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you mean to enter?

68
00:07:01,251 --> 00:07:01,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

69
00:07:01,711 --> 00:07:02,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, we will.

70
00:07:02,792 --> 00:07:03,753
[SPEAKER_05]: We will do that as well.

71
00:07:03,834 --> 00:07:04,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

72
00:07:04,354 --> 00:07:08,659
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, teachers too, but custodians are in every room, every day.

73
00:07:12,252 --> 00:07:37,093
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so then would it make sense for us to identify the things that are on this plan that maybe still aren't done and need to be done and push them into the system as well as to go, maybe ask you to go through the list of 27 projects in the city's capital plan and push those in so that we can generate a list and then, you know, perhaps

74
00:07:38,595 --> 00:07:44,063
[SPEAKER_02]: What we might so that's like startup right so we can get everything sort of pushed into the system.

75
00:07:44,845 --> 00:07:52,877
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm wondering if on an annual basis we set some sort of like timeline or schedule around like when will we have.

76
00:07:53,197 --> 00:07:59,841
[SPEAKER_02]: an annual capital planning discussion so that this committee has that clear marching order.

77
00:08:00,381 --> 00:08:14,308
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we do it later in the evening so it's not such a working session, but more of a presentation of what those things are so the community can understand what those plans are and when.

78
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:20,812
[SPEAKER_02]: I think my suggestion would be that that happen not in May,

79
00:08:26,936 --> 00:08:48,511
[SPEAKER_02]: But I actually am almost wondering if we set this up to be like a November, December activity so that before the halfway point of the year and long before budget and long before free cash certifies, like we are proactively being able to like say and report out.

80
00:08:49,871 --> 00:08:52,032
[SPEAKER_02]: what, you know, what we believe that we need.

81
00:08:52,272 --> 00:08:53,752
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that make sense?

82
00:08:53,832 --> 00:08:54,372
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes sense.

83
00:08:54,432 --> 00:09:09,635
[SPEAKER_05]: It's also I wonder if it's this committee that would be really this subcommittee to be really helpful for me and other people working with me on operations to say, all right, when are we going to make asks of this new stabilization fund?

84
00:09:09,995 --> 00:09:10,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

85
00:09:10,455 --> 00:09:14,196
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, prior really prioritization of projects.

86
00:09:14,776 --> 00:09:17,757
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I've presented on safety and security.

87
00:09:18,845 --> 00:09:26,910
[SPEAKER_05]: We all know that our new schools, which we should not call new schools anymore, are now approaching midlife at 22 and 24 years old.

88
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,951
[SPEAKER_05]: And so moving forward with various projects,

89
00:09:36,877 --> 00:09:51,496
[SPEAKER_05]: There are certain things like the HVAC projects at the Andrews-Lehman lands, replacing kitchen equipment, various things along those lines, that we just want to make sure that the committee is well informed, but is also approving expenditures.

90
00:09:51,917 --> 00:09:52,738
[SPEAKER_05]: As an example,

91
00:09:53,479 --> 00:10:09,633
[SPEAKER_05]: we have done significant lighting upgrades that as electric rates rise, we're using less electricity, but we also need to pay for those over a 60-month payoff that's on bill financing.

92
00:10:09,793 --> 00:10:14,397
[SPEAKER_05]: But our usage would be much higher and our cost would be much higher

93
00:10:14,912 --> 00:10:17,213
[SPEAKER_05]: without lowering our carbon footprint.

94
00:10:17,694 --> 00:10:23,898
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've done that at the end, we've done that at the blend, we've done that at the Roberts, we've done parts of that at Medford High School.

95
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:30,802
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though Medford High School is sunsetting, hopefully, pray, you know, that's still six years out.

96
00:10:31,222 --> 00:10:32,924
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, a lot of electricity.

97
00:10:33,124 --> 00:10:33,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

98
00:10:33,764 --> 00:10:48,178
[SPEAKER_05]: So, but I would like to hopefully at some point present, say, the Brooks and the Mississaugas, the last two schools, you as the body have the ability to look at the numbers and give approval, not give approval to these $300,000 projects.

99
00:10:48,198 --> 00:10:48,278
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

100
00:10:48,298 --> 00:10:48,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

101
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:48,938
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, sorry, go ahead.

102
00:10:53,008 --> 00:10:56,771
[SPEAKER_03]: No, my question is how this intersects with the building and grounds subcommittee.

103
00:10:56,972 --> 00:11:00,855
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think your question was more directly related to it.

104
00:11:01,075 --> 00:11:02,517
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a good question.

105
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:09,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Buildings and grounds has historically done many different things.

106
00:11:10,684 --> 00:11:15,288
[SPEAKER_02]: But in its last iterations, they were focused more on

107
00:11:16,407 --> 00:11:27,995
[SPEAKER_02]: community driven beautification efforts and the more tactical day-to-day stuff.

108
00:11:29,096 --> 00:11:31,378
[SPEAKER_02]: And that may still be the right thing for them versus

109
00:11:32,138 --> 00:11:41,145
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm almost thinking like this committee will get together to sort of craft what ultimately according to our policy really should be happening at a committee of the whole.

110
00:11:41,766 --> 00:11:52,274
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we think about like doing our work in October to collect to make sure that like we have, you know, we have a report out of the ticketing system, we can sort of

111
00:11:53,620 --> 00:12:05,463
[SPEAKER_02]: craft what we think is the right prioritization and then bring it to a committee of the whole to present that to the entire committee so we have the entire committee's involvement in that.

112
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:09,004
[SPEAKER_02]: That might make some sense in terms of a flow.

113
00:12:09,144 --> 00:12:18,706
[SPEAKER_02]: And then certainly, because the whole committee's there, those folks that are on buildings and grounds, if there was something happening in their committee, they could also weigh in and shift the plan.

114
00:12:18,726 --> 00:12:22,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I assume we don't do joint subcommittee meetings.

115
00:12:22,407 --> 00:12:34,777
[SPEAKER_06]: Usually not which makes the numbers, but also I'm thinking that like so we as a full committee would set out and put our stamp of approval on the capital improvement plan annually.

116
00:12:35,647 --> 00:12:37,768
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, there's a bunch of input.

117
00:12:38,269 --> 00:12:44,953
[SPEAKER_06]: Before we get to that meeting, you know, we don't need to know about like the paint fixes here and there and the water filter replacements.

118
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:53,338
[SPEAKER_06]: And obviously, when Peter, Dr. Cushing goes through all of the training and reporting, he'll be able to get us a report that's a meaningful starting place.

119
00:12:53,778 --> 00:12:55,480
[SPEAKER_06]: But that, so that we

120
00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:18,949
[SPEAKER_06]: would as a committee would approve it and that the individual items you know we would send that over presumably to the city for a request for the funds they would give us a certain amount but they would not get to decide the order of that list like we we've decided this is the order of what we're going to do and this is the request that we're putting how much we want and you give us as much as you can and then we

121
00:13:20,327 --> 00:13:32,072
[SPEAKER_06]: Starting at the top of our list go down, but then each of those projects actually seems like would be things that would go into their buildings and grounds committee to monitor and check on progress and like, how is it happening?

122
00:13:33,613 --> 00:13:34,493
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just my thought.

123
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,741
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that makes sense.

124
00:13:35,761 --> 00:13:40,945
[SPEAKER_03]: So the other thing I was going to say, when you said it's time for the school to take this back and make the decision, absolutely.

125
00:13:40,985 --> 00:13:51,413
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think we need to build into whatever our procedure is, a regular reporting to the city or court, because we need to be in their capital planning.

126
00:13:51,453 --> 00:13:51,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

127
00:13:52,574 --> 00:13:55,876
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that intersection is a very interesting one, because there

128
00:14:02,146 --> 00:14:24,120
[SPEAKER_06]: there may be projects that are on our plan that the city in whole manages in every imaginable way and then projects that we are managing in whole and then projects where we're both managing it so like what it looks like on their plan is is an interesting question like i mean because

129
00:14:24,992 --> 00:14:32,076
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we want their plan to just have like a, you know, if it was a pie, like there's a pie slice and it just says schools.

130
00:14:34,858 --> 00:14:40,581
[SPEAKER_06]: Or do we want their pie to have our, you know, like our list may in fact be 100 items long.

131
00:14:42,859 --> 00:14:48,762
[SPEAKER_06]: Their presentation is not intended to be at that level of detail, which is why I like what they're doing.

132
00:14:48,802 --> 00:14:52,363
[SPEAKER_03]: They're turning all municipal roofs to solar.

133
00:14:52,504 --> 00:14:52,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?

134
00:14:52,964 --> 00:14:54,124
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, we want in on that.

135
00:14:54,244 --> 00:14:55,405
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got to be part of that.

136
00:14:55,545 --> 00:14:55,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

137
00:14:56,709 --> 00:15:10,918
[SPEAKER_05]: I think also we have to, we also being in on that, I think we also have to make a decision like, we're not just going to do X slipper roofs, no, we want a full roof replacement with full insulation and it will last for another 30 years.

138
00:15:10,978 --> 00:15:11,238
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

139
00:15:11,658 --> 00:15:12,799
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

140
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:16,101
[SPEAKER_06]: That's where taking it back is really the point.

141
00:15:16,441 --> 00:15:16,821
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

142
00:15:16,841 --> 00:15:21,424
[SPEAKER_05]: I also think that the difference between buildings and grounds and capital planning,

143
00:15:22,012 --> 00:15:35,442
[SPEAKER_05]: is that capital planning should be big vision, kind of setting the standard for where the district needs to go with its about 1.2 million square feet of space over our multiple buildings.

144
00:15:35,903 --> 00:15:38,444
[SPEAKER_05]: And as one example, I was planning to submit a

145
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:47,347
[SPEAKER_05]: request to CPA to do a historic assessment of the Curtis Tubs to see what that facility would need.

146
00:15:47,827 --> 00:15:54,208
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, given the events of last night in our discussion to co-locate, is that something that we should still continue?

147
00:15:54,288 --> 00:16:00,830
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's something I see as a capital planning decision, you know, kind of guiding the leadership of the district.

148
00:16:01,607 --> 00:16:04,209
[SPEAKER_02]: So two things sort of come to mind.

149
00:16:04,369 --> 00:16:21,242
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a conversation with Alicia Hunt last week and we were talking about this process of recommissioning buildings which essentially like looks at sort of everything and says like here's how you restore this building to its like original

150
00:16:21,862 --> 00:16:24,144
[SPEAKER_02]: like purpose and function.

151
00:16:24,244 --> 00:16:25,966
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is what you have to do in order to get there.

152
00:16:26,746 --> 00:16:35,914
[SPEAKER_02]: And eventually the idea is like, we should do that one building at a time in rotation over a number of years.

153
00:16:36,014 --> 00:16:39,277
[SPEAKER_02]: And then no building is ever more than like six or seven years out.

154
00:16:40,178 --> 00:16:45,342
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's enough to like have that sort of big picture point of view.

155
00:16:47,104 --> 00:16:58,094
[SPEAKER_02]: The city has indicated a willingness to do that for all of our outbuildings, not this building, not Curtis Tufts, right now.

156
00:16:58,495 --> 00:17:07,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Alicia, her opinion is that the OPM that they're bringing on to do the Andrews McGlynn project,

157
00:17:08,524 --> 00:17:13,509
[SPEAKER_02]: They are the right people to help us do this, too, because of their deep familiarity with the district.

158
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:20,856
[SPEAKER_02]: And so she was definitely sort of favorable to working with them to help facilitate that process.

159
00:17:21,817 --> 00:17:28,524
[SPEAKER_02]: But to her point, when you recommission a building, what you get out of it is a list of problems to fix.

160
00:17:29,144 --> 00:17:33,065
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not recommissioned at the end of the process.

161
00:17:33,105 --> 00:17:34,425
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the beginning of the process.

162
00:17:34,946 --> 00:17:37,326
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically the creation of your to-do list.

163
00:17:37,406 --> 00:17:50,570
[SPEAKER_02]: But all of those things should feed either work orders for the maintenance team to do because they have capacity to do X or Y or Z, or something that has to go on the capital plan.

164
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:59,133
[SPEAKER_02]: the output of the recommissioning study should go into the ticketing system so that we have one place for all of this to go.

165
00:17:59,613 --> 00:18:11,839
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think Alicia can be a real ally in that and she's indicated a willingness to attend meetings provided that we can say, hey, this is the meeting I want you to attend because she's got her plate.

166
00:18:13,099 --> 00:18:13,600
[SPEAKER_06]: That's great news.

167
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,360
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that.

168
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,320
[SPEAKER_06]: That makes a lot of sense.

169
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:26,226
[SPEAKER_06]: I also like, you know, if we can do the recommissioning studies pretty much all at once, then we don't end up with a scenario where one school is getting

170
00:18:27,783 --> 00:18:28,763
[SPEAKER_02]: something different.

171
00:18:28,783 --> 00:18:34,026
[SPEAKER_06]: Lots of lovely things, while there are things that are more serious at other schools that just haven't been put on the list yet.

172
00:18:34,526 --> 00:18:35,046
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

173
00:18:35,567 --> 00:18:40,369
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, that having all those at once will allow us to prioritize from a district perspective.

174
00:18:40,509 --> 00:18:40,809
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

175
00:18:41,209 --> 00:18:41,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

176
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:43,851
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, not to discount our current OPM.

177
00:18:44,431 --> 00:18:51,114
[SPEAKER_05]: However, the city of Medford has recently contracted with three architectural firms

178
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:54,420
[SPEAKER_05]: for what they're calling house doctor services.

179
00:18:55,341 --> 00:18:57,141
[SPEAKER_05]: And, say again?

180
00:18:57,442 --> 00:18:58,862
[SPEAKER_06]: I never even heard these words.

181
00:18:58,962 --> 00:19:04,925
[SPEAKER_05]: And basically they're on-call architectural firms to assist with various things.

182
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:12,348
[SPEAKER_05]: So, and one of those happens to be the original architect for the five schools.

183
00:19:12,528 --> 00:19:13,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that HMFA?

184
00:19:13,709 --> 00:19:13,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

185
00:19:14,009 --> 00:19:14,249
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

186
00:19:14,429 --> 00:19:14,589
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

187
00:19:17,078 --> 00:19:22,783
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they're sort of another potential that could be part, you know, be part of the conversation.

188
00:19:22,803 --> 00:19:38,376
[SPEAKER_06]: Am I wrong to just, you know, just to check me on this, like that any OPM and anybody we hire to do this is gonna provide us a reasonably functioning, the reports not gonna look terribly different from one to the next.

189
00:19:38,436 --> 00:19:39,857
[SPEAKER_02]: No, probably not, no.

190
00:19:40,518 --> 00:19:44,441
[SPEAKER_02]: And it could be that BTQ, I think that's their name,

191
00:19:46,201 --> 00:19:47,362
[SPEAKER_02]: Does the OPM work?

192
00:19:47,482 --> 00:19:48,303
[SPEAKER_05]: They're a designer.

193
00:19:48,463 --> 00:19:49,624
[SPEAKER_05]: JLL is the OPM.

194
00:19:49,764 --> 00:19:50,064
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

195
00:19:50,224 --> 00:19:51,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

196
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:52,987
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

197
00:19:53,487 --> 00:19:57,650
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought she was talking about B2Q to actually execute the recommissioning study.

198
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:59,192
[SPEAKER_02]: I can check with her.

199
00:19:59,232 --> 00:20:00,553
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, we can find that out.

200
00:20:00,613 --> 00:20:02,094
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not overly concerned about it.

201
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:10,701
[SPEAKER_02]: The other question I had is timing-wise, if we were to say our process is from October 1st to October 15th,

202
00:20:11,962 --> 00:20:25,033
[SPEAKER_02]: we're going to push out a proactive email to the principals of the buildings to say, if there is something that belongs on our capital plan, speak now, submit your tickets so that we can catch all of those and categorize them.

203
00:20:25,613 --> 00:20:36,462
[SPEAKER_02]: And then between late October, early November, maybe late October into November, maybe we'll give ourselves the month of November because it's November and it's a short month.

204
00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:47,709
[SPEAKER_02]: We sort of meet and put together sort of a starting point and then in December, 1 of our meetings becomes or part of 1 of our meetings becomes a committee of the whole where we review that.

205
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:51,952
[SPEAKER_02]: That timing all works in the lead up to, like.

206
00:20:53,205 --> 00:20:57,408
[SPEAKER_02]: free cash being available if we are dependent on free cash for something.

207
00:20:57,828 --> 00:21:02,271
[SPEAKER_02]: It also predates or precedes our budget cycle.

208
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:05,453
[SPEAKER_06]: Because some of that stuff will not be stuff that can be waiting for.

209
00:21:05,714 --> 00:21:06,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.

210
00:21:08,496 --> 00:21:16,941
[SPEAKER_02]: Presumably, if there's a stabilization fund, you could tap into that at any time, but also it's not like an endless pot of money, so that prioritization is needed.

211
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:21,304
[SPEAKER_02]: The one question I have is, where does the CPC

212
00:21:23,067 --> 00:21:29,635
[SPEAKER_02]: time cycle like fall into that sequence because the CPC has a standing annual process.

213
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:30,456
[SPEAKER_02]: What is CPC?

214
00:21:30,616 --> 00:21:32,798
[SPEAKER_02]: The Community Preservation Committee.

215
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:35,021
[SPEAKER_02]: So they have been integral to like.

216
00:21:35,101 --> 00:21:35,762
[SPEAKER_02]: I know what they do.

217
00:21:35,802 --> 00:21:40,848
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the playground, McGlynn Playground, but all three of the playground surfaces.

218
00:21:40,868 --> 00:21:40,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

219
00:21:43,185 --> 00:21:46,308
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't exactly know, like, when are their applications due?

220
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:53,556
[SPEAKER_02]: I would just want us to like, I think there are certain things that are rolling, but I, but I thought there were like rounds.

221
00:21:54,257 --> 00:21:56,939
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would just want to make sure, like, wherever that fits, like.

222
00:21:58,072 --> 00:22:01,313
[SPEAKER_02]: It all fits into this process because I would hate for us to be like, this is great.

223
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:04,134
[SPEAKER_02]: And we could get CPC funding and like, oh, we just missed it.

224
00:22:04,314 --> 00:22:07,136
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't want us to like set a cycle.

225
00:22:08,016 --> 00:22:10,137
[SPEAKER_03]: July 8th round opens.

226
00:22:10,337 --> 00:22:12,838
[SPEAKER_03]: July 31st, eligibility forms due.

227
00:22:13,258 --> 00:22:15,319
[SPEAKER_03]: September 10th, full applications due.

228
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:19,660
[SPEAKER_03]: and 22nd application presentations to the committee.

229
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,481
[SPEAKER_03]: That's for this year.

230
00:22:20,501 --> 00:22:31,544
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm also submitting an off-cycle application for three bicycle repair and bike pump stations to be installed at the McGlynn, the Andrews, and the high school.

231
00:22:31,844 --> 00:22:32,465
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that.

232
00:22:32,845 --> 00:22:35,826
[SPEAKER_03]: In special circumstances, off-cycle applications may be considered.

233
00:22:36,046 --> 00:22:42,348
[SPEAKER_03]: Applicants must demonstrate an emergent public need and evidence of seeking alternative funding to the current

234
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:49,310
[SPEAKER_06]: So so I think this timing works well, because we will actually sort of know we'll finish the budget.

235
00:22:49,851 --> 00:22:52,051
[SPEAKER_06]: We will have an idea.

236
00:22:52,071 --> 00:22:54,232
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you know, free cash will be certified.

237
00:22:54,252 --> 00:22:57,473
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything going into stabilization fund will have been completed by July one.

238
00:22:58,714 --> 00:23:01,295
[SPEAKER_06]: So we will really be.

239
00:23:03,192 --> 00:23:15,321
[SPEAKER_06]: way ahead of the game in like, here's the list of things and we're just sitting around waiting for the free cash certification in the city's budget picture to become clear.

240
00:23:15,341 --> 00:23:17,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

241
00:23:18,484 --> 00:23:19,084
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

242
00:23:19,604 --> 00:23:27,530
[SPEAKER_03]: In response to your comment about the principles, I think we need some threshold guidelines on what constitutes a capital project.

243
00:23:28,211 --> 00:23:28,711
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that.

244
00:23:28,992 --> 00:23:29,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

245
00:23:30,853 --> 00:23:37,217
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Jerry could actually really give good information on what constitutes a capital project.

246
00:23:39,239 --> 00:23:39,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Jerry.

247
00:23:39,939 --> 00:23:41,040
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Jerry.

248
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:43,942
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you mind sitting over here?

249
00:23:44,262 --> 00:23:46,304
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a video right there.

250
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:49,266
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I see.

251
00:23:50,787 --> 00:23:56,651
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, DESE publishes guidelines for net school spending.

252
00:24:00,084 --> 00:24:10,729
[SPEAKER_00]: I will refresh my memory on the current guidelines, but typically any project that is over $150,000 per project per school would be excluded from net school spending.

253
00:24:18,882 --> 00:24:26,405
[SPEAKER_00]: which means it wouldn't count towards the required spending to access Chapter 70 funds.

254
00:24:27,105 --> 00:24:29,706
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's 100% on the city.

255
00:24:30,526 --> 00:24:43,631
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I was in Chelsea, we tried to put those projects in the capital plan for city-only funding, and then projects that wouldn't meet that requirement,

256
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:49,082
[SPEAKER_00]: or wouldn't meet that threshold would be in the school budget.

257
00:24:50,043 --> 00:25:00,649
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not an issue if you happen to do a $200,000 out of the school budget, it just wouldn't count towards net school spending at the end of the year.

258
00:25:00,909 --> 00:25:11,095
[SPEAKER_00]: And typically the city is way over net school spending, so you'd never put your Chapter 70 funding in jeopardy by doing that.

259
00:25:11,115 --> 00:25:12,636
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.

260
00:25:14,317 --> 00:25:30,652
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the interesting thing about the McGlynn is that's really two schools, so you're going to have a $1,000 limit if you were doing a project, say, HVAC that affected both schools.

261
00:25:32,425 --> 00:25:35,267
[SPEAKER_00]: you could split the cost of that project over those schools.

262
00:25:36,207 --> 00:25:47,734
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that would be true if you had funding to do something over four or five schools, then you could allocate it for the purpose of the limitations.

263
00:25:48,155 --> 00:25:57,280
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, because the McGlynn is two schools, is that limit in place if we really just do something like in one of the sides?

264
00:25:58,301 --> 00:26:00,222
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just treated as- It would just apply to one school.

265
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,561
[SPEAKER_06]: But then the limit's not 300 for that.

266
00:26:03,601 --> 00:26:04,121
[SPEAKER_06]: It'd be 150.

267
00:26:04,721 --> 00:26:07,602
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, great.

268
00:26:08,262 --> 00:26:19,686
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have found two other presentations beyond the 27 projects that are listed here, so in the city's plan.

269
00:26:20,367 --> 00:26:25,869
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I just wanted to run through because they're old, but I don't think that necessarily means they're not

270
00:26:26,969 --> 00:26:28,110
[SPEAKER_02]: that they're done.

271
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:32,191
[SPEAKER_02]: So this list has, it's mostly lighting.

272
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:38,814
[SPEAKER_02]: So Peter, I think that's a question in terms of cafeteria and exterior lighting.

273
00:26:39,214 --> 00:26:44,356
[SPEAKER_05]: So that has, so on those, it also mentions hallway lighting in some places.

274
00:26:44,996 --> 00:26:53,120
[SPEAKER_05]: So the entire McGlynn with some spotty areas has had all, and by spotty areas, I mean like a few offices,

275
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:56,904
[SPEAKER_05]: and a few locations that I'm working with the vendor to have replaced.

276
00:26:58,006 --> 00:27:07,799
[SPEAKER_05]: We have replaced all of the lighting at the McGlynn, Roberts, and we're currently working on an exterior project at the Andrews and the McGlynn.

277
00:27:10,189 --> 00:27:30,625
[SPEAKER_05]: But all of that has been replaced with high efficiency, 25-year lifespan, no need to replace anything, LED, that both daylight harvest, so they will turn off if it's bright enough, and they also have dimming capabilities, and then automatic off after a set period.

278
00:27:32,727 --> 00:27:34,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so I just want to finish going through this list.

279
00:27:34,588 --> 00:27:40,612
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Roberts School exterior lighting, are there exterior lighting needs that have not been addressed?

280
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:41,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope, it's not addressed.

281
00:27:41,752 --> 00:27:41,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

282
00:27:42,513 --> 00:27:44,894
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Missittuck has not yet been done.

283
00:27:44,994 --> 00:27:46,415
[SPEAKER_02]: Brooks has not yet been done.

284
00:27:47,196 --> 00:27:47,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Curtis Tufts.

285
00:27:49,197 --> 00:27:50,377
[SPEAKER_05]: Curtis Tufts has been done.

286
00:27:50,397 --> 00:27:52,479
[SPEAKER_02]: Whole building LED.

287
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:53,980
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't say whole building.

288
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:54,900
[SPEAKER_05]: I know hallways.

289
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,221
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to check on the classrooms.

290
00:27:57,615 --> 00:28:00,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so if you can check on that one.

291
00:28:00,978 --> 00:28:02,319
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

292
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:04,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Automotive shop LED?

293
00:28:04,841 --> 00:28:08,585
[SPEAKER_05]: All shops have been 100% upgraded to LED lights.

294
00:28:08,665 --> 00:28:08,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

295
00:28:09,606 --> 00:28:11,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Andrews, halls and stairwells?

296
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:12,568
[SPEAKER_05]: Complete.

297
00:28:13,109 --> 00:28:14,570
[SPEAKER_02]: And whole building LED?

298
00:28:15,311 --> 00:28:19,234
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I need to check on the classrooms for Andrews.

299
00:28:19,274 --> 00:28:23,258
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some question there, because if you visit the Robertson and McGlynn,

300
00:28:24,489 --> 00:28:37,413
[SPEAKER_05]: and the other schools, the Mississippi, the Andrews, and the Roberts, you'll see that what were hanging light fixtures have now been flush mounted, which teachers have reported, the few that I've talked to about it, like, wow, it just really opens up the room.

301
00:28:39,054 --> 00:28:47,416
[SPEAKER_05]: There are still hanging light fixtures in the Andrews, so I don't know if those were just light bulb upgrade and replacements for LED.

302
00:28:47,956 --> 00:28:48,236
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.

303
00:28:48,396 --> 00:28:49,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so you can check on that one.

304
00:28:50,642 --> 00:28:53,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Also on the Andrews School, and this list, by the way, this list is from like 2017, 2018.

305
00:28:53,923 --> 00:28:57,284
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want to make sure there's stuff that's still there.

306
00:28:57,324 --> 00:28:58,385
[SPEAKER_02]: We're taking it forward.

307
00:28:59,465 --> 00:29:02,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Andrews School, it says controls upgrade for ADR.

308
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:04,567
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't even actually know what that means.

309
00:29:05,927 --> 00:29:08,608
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have to look it up.

310
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:09,188
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't.

311
00:29:11,469 --> 00:29:12,429
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me do it quick.

312
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:13,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Automatic dimming.

313
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:14,390
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

314
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:16,551
[SPEAKER_03]: All day refrigeration.

315
00:29:17,671 --> 00:29:19,692
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't open my computer.

316
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,703
[SPEAKER_03]: ADR systems automatically adjust HVAC.

317
00:29:24,644 --> 00:29:24,884
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

318
00:29:25,205 --> 00:29:28,289
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that that control was replaced.

319
00:29:28,309 --> 00:29:29,851
[SPEAKER_05]: Because of the pandemic.

320
00:29:30,251 --> 00:29:30,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

321
00:29:30,832 --> 00:29:32,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

322
00:29:34,537 --> 00:29:35,238
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's not us.

323
00:29:35,258 --> 00:29:36,539
[SPEAKER_02]: That's public safety.

324
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

325
00:29:37,501 --> 00:29:37,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Andrews?

326
00:29:39,464 --> 00:29:43,929
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll find it funny to know that they said the Andrews HVAC upgrades were going to cost $25,000.

327
00:29:44,069 --> 00:29:52,678
[SPEAKER_05]: So I also did just share with you, I located from our previous finance director, Mr. Murphy,

328
00:29:53,259 --> 00:29:58,082
[SPEAKER_05]: he had put together a CAP, a CIP.

329
00:29:58,763 --> 00:30:01,945
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I've shared that with everybody around this table.

330
00:30:02,285 --> 00:30:15,733
[SPEAKER_05]: But I would say, and this is no fault of Mr. Murphy, but I would say that a comprehensive researching of what things cost, the numbers that are in there, I don't know are accurate.

331
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:22,678
[SPEAKER_05]: And unfortunately, just in my research on some things are woefully more expensive.

332
00:30:23,533 --> 00:30:23,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Got it.

333
00:30:25,835 --> 00:30:26,336
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so sorry.

334
00:30:26,356 --> 00:30:27,517
[SPEAKER_03]: Does anyone have nut allergies?

335
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:28,318
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

336
00:30:29,298 --> 00:30:33,663
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but thank you for asking.

337
00:30:34,503 --> 00:30:38,667
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so then the second plan, just to bring us to current.

338
00:30:39,228 --> 00:30:40,289
[SPEAKER_05]: This is draft number three.

339
00:30:40,792 --> 00:30:42,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, draft number three.

340
00:30:43,693 --> 00:30:49,896
[SPEAKER_02]: Two air compressors at the Brooks, five air compressors at Missittuck, two air compressors at Roberts.

341
00:30:50,576 --> 00:30:51,977
[SPEAKER_02]: They all were replaced.

342
00:30:51,997 --> 00:30:52,777
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that correct?

343
00:30:52,797 --> 00:31:01,801
[SPEAKER_05]: In the summer of 2019, there was a free cash allotment from the mayor and the city council at the time that allowed for all of that compressor work to be completed.

344
00:31:02,141 --> 00:31:03,922
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

345
00:31:04,262 --> 00:31:06,983
[SPEAKER_02]: Andrew's new roof, that actually got done.

346
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:16,743
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to qualify new roof because what it was was a, I'll call it a film that was put over the entire roof.

347
00:31:16,803 --> 00:31:22,004
[SPEAKER_05]: It's white that helps reflect the sun, but it also extends the life of that roof.

348
00:31:22,704 --> 00:31:34,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Alicia Hunt has said numerous times that it extends it significantly and I believe her, but I always question, should we consider the R-value insulation on that roof?

349
00:31:36,089 --> 00:31:39,451
[SPEAKER_05]: as part of, you know, where we move forward.

350
00:31:39,792 --> 00:31:40,152
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

351
00:31:41,553 --> 00:31:45,476
[SPEAKER_02]: McGlynn Complex had auditorium seating work for $25,000?

352
00:31:45,676 --> 00:31:46,677
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

353
00:31:48,219 --> 00:31:52,822
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't, I would say that it happened because there really isn't any issue with the seating in there.

354
00:31:53,323 --> 00:31:58,006
[SPEAKER_05]: But the seating in the auditoriums definitely does take abuse.

355
00:31:58,287 --> 00:32:04,852
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there are about 25 seats in the high school auditorium right now that are damaged and need repair.

356
00:32:05,547 --> 00:32:05,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

357
00:32:06,828 --> 00:32:12,930
[SPEAKER_02]: And then at the high school, replace repair fire alarm sealing system in 2019.

358
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:21,673
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can't speak to whether or not that was done, but I do know that we did significant fire alarm work this past fall.

359
00:32:21,693 --> 00:32:26,194
[SPEAKER_05]: The fire alarm system at Medford High School requires constant attention.

360
00:32:26,614 --> 00:32:26,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

361
00:32:27,255 --> 00:32:27,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

362
00:32:27,915 --> 00:32:30,075
[SPEAKER_05]: As member Rousseau signs the warrants, he knows.

363
00:32:30,776 --> 00:32:31,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

364
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:32,976
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we had

365
00:32:35,219 --> 00:32:37,242
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to put security improvements to the side.

366
00:32:37,262 --> 00:32:38,884
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that's an ongoing conversation.

367
00:32:39,885 --> 00:32:43,810
[SPEAKER_02]: The Andrews outside curb repairs, those curbs are still not installed.

368
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:44,631
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that correct?

369
00:32:44,892 --> 00:32:46,674
[SPEAKER_05]: So there are some that are just sitting there.

370
00:32:46,734 --> 00:32:48,757
[SPEAKER_05]: There are some that have been done.

371
00:32:48,797 --> 00:32:50,279
[SPEAKER_05]: My whole time on the school committee.

372
00:32:51,378 --> 00:33:00,024
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there is an item here for the McGlynn complex, asphalt and tire complex, including Andrew side curb repairs.

373
00:33:01,205 --> 00:33:04,047
[SPEAKER_02]: So all of that is still like in progress, right?

374
00:33:04,167 --> 00:33:05,168
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not complete.

375
00:33:05,348 --> 00:33:06,689
[SPEAKER_05]: I would consider it in progress.

376
00:33:06,749 --> 00:33:12,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Last year, the DPW ground the road down.

377
00:33:12,893 --> 00:33:13,174
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

378
00:33:13,314 --> 00:33:15,415
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it was significantly worse than it was.

379
00:33:15,976 --> 00:33:19,298
[SPEAKER_05]: And they did a temporary like paving job, but

380
00:33:19,981 --> 00:33:24,004
[SPEAKER_05]: there's a longer term plan on the city side since the city took that over.

381
00:33:24,664 --> 00:33:30,648
[SPEAKER_05]: Prior to this, that road was the responsibility, 100% of the metropolitan schools, lighting, curbing, everything.

382
00:33:31,268 --> 00:33:32,429
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it just changed last year.

383
00:33:32,729 --> 00:33:34,750
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we don't have the capacity to manage it.

384
00:33:36,772 --> 00:33:41,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so I'm not gonna worry about some of the later things for high school.

385
00:33:43,736 --> 00:33:44,636
[SPEAKER_02]: McGlynn Complex,

386
00:33:45,917 --> 00:33:50,958
[SPEAKER_02]: roof rebuild, air compressors, and chiller contact compressor.

387
00:33:51,038 --> 00:33:56,299
[SPEAKER_02]: All of that is being handled with this HVAC project that will go in for the system to be tracked.

388
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:00,220
[SPEAKER_05]: The roof rebuild is somewhere up in the air in question.

389
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:10,403
[SPEAKER_05]: But what I did notice in one of the documents there from either Collins, when those came out, they suggested a five-year roof rebuild with one each year.

390
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:15,004
[SPEAKER_05]: And those plans are at least five years old, and we have not stopped any.

391
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:28,846
[SPEAKER_02]: So we would have some sort of roof assessment, which I think we can sort of let recommissioning guide priority there, which is fine.

392
00:34:31,328 --> 00:34:41,013
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing that's on here looks like water heaters at the Andrews.

393
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:45,847
[SPEAKER_05]: The water heaters have been replaced.

394
00:34:45,907 --> 00:34:47,450
[SPEAKER_05]: We thought they were going to cost $80,000.

395
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:48,431
[SPEAKER_06]: What were they actually?

396
00:34:48,452 --> 00:34:52,819
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't remember what they were, but it was another number.

397
00:34:55,608 --> 00:35:01,650
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, for full disloyalty, she hot water heater at the Brooks has failed.

398
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:07,092
[SPEAKER_05]: It's original to the building, and we're currently trying to work through what that would take.

399
00:35:07,192 --> 00:35:08,692
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think that we should go.

400
00:35:08,772 --> 00:35:12,133
[SPEAKER_05]: My recommendation is that we go through a formal RFP process.

401
00:35:13,353 --> 00:35:19,915
[SPEAKER_05]: I was seeking an emergency waiver of that, but we're able to mitigate the need for hot water right now.

402
00:35:20,336 --> 00:35:24,917
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think it's in the district's best financial interest to go through an RFP process.

403
00:35:26,685 --> 00:35:27,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

404
00:35:27,065 --> 00:35:32,006
[SPEAKER_03]: To what extent does water heater failure at the Brooks predict Roberts?

405
00:35:32,386 --> 00:35:34,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they already failed.

406
00:35:34,327 --> 00:35:35,447
[SPEAKER_03]: They already failed.

407
00:35:36,107 --> 00:35:37,507
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

408
00:35:37,527 --> 00:35:39,788
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a prediction, but it already happened.

409
00:35:39,848 --> 00:35:40,348
[SPEAKER_03]: I see.

410
00:35:40,408 --> 00:35:42,969
[SPEAKER_05]: It was predicted.

411
00:35:43,709 --> 00:35:53,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Those were originally 400-gallon hot water heaters because there was no way to, if you ever want to take a tour of the mechanical rooms of the district,

412
00:35:54,211 --> 00:35:57,992
[SPEAKER_05]: there's no real way to get things in and out.

413
00:35:58,333 --> 00:36:07,816
[SPEAKER_05]: And so rather than doing one 400, there are two 190 or 200 gallon water heaters.

414
00:36:07,856 --> 00:36:08,796
[SPEAKER_06]: The one here is pretty cool.

415
00:36:08,816 --> 00:36:12,077
[SPEAKER_06]: There's stuff that is never going to be gone until they demolish this building.

416
00:36:12,117 --> 00:36:13,438
[SPEAKER_03]: I live in an old high school.

417
00:36:13,618 --> 00:36:16,899
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that stuff still there too?

418
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:18,020
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably.

419
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:20,160
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they did the condo conversion in 84.

420
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:20,440
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

421
00:36:22,237 --> 00:36:28,601
[SPEAKER_00]: It is, that could also be for redundancy, you know, in case one fails.

422
00:36:28,881 --> 00:36:31,243
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some.

423
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:33,464
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is a good way to go.

424
00:36:35,005 --> 00:36:37,947
[SPEAKER_02]: So we said CPC applications are like July?

425
00:36:38,407 --> 00:36:39,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Opens in July, due in September.

426
00:36:41,352 --> 00:36:41,612
[SPEAKER_06]: What was it?

427
00:36:41,632 --> 00:36:42,933
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to be able to put that on our board.

428
00:36:42,953 --> 00:36:44,034
[SPEAKER_03]: That was eligibility.

429
00:36:44,174 --> 00:36:47,816
[SPEAKER_03]: So you should be submitting a letter before you do a poll.

430
00:36:47,836 --> 00:36:48,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, OK.

431
00:36:48,536 --> 00:36:51,177
[SPEAKER_05]: Jen, do you remember what the playground surfaces cost?

432
00:36:51,398 --> 00:36:51,678
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't.

433
00:36:51,758 --> 00:36:53,018
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I can look it up.

434
00:36:53,159 --> 00:36:55,080
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just saying it was $15,000.

435
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:55,680
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.

436
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,680
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they were the $120,000.

437
00:36:57,081 --> 00:36:57,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

438
00:36:58,982 --> 00:36:59,582
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, all right.

439
00:36:59,622 --> 00:37:00,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think they were the $120,000.

440
00:37:00,483 --> 00:37:00,663
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, huge.

441
00:37:00,683 --> 00:37:02,564
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they were not inexpensive.

442
00:37:02,904 --> 00:37:04,705
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I know McQueen's was going to be half a million.

443
00:37:05,065 --> 00:37:05,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

444
00:37:06,426 --> 00:37:07,806
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was many years ago.

445
00:37:07,847 --> 00:37:08,087
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

446
00:37:08,587 --> 00:37:10,208
[SPEAKER_02]: So then I think what was it?

447
00:37:10,825 --> 00:37:14,926
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, the surfacing at Roberts was 109,540.

448
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:15,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

449
00:37:16,147 --> 00:37:17,927
[SPEAKER_06]: And what year was that?

450
00:37:18,207 --> 00:37:20,068
[SPEAKER_03]: In... That's 2018.

451
00:37:20,348 --> 00:37:22,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it was like early when we started.

452
00:37:23,109 --> 00:37:23,349
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, 18.

453
00:37:23,549 --> 00:37:24,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

454
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:35,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so I think from a sort of process and cadence perspective, and Jerry, please weigh in, what we talked about was like,

455
00:37:37,313 --> 00:37:43,678
[SPEAKER_02]: a desire to use the ticketing system sort of push all of the things into it so that it can come, it can be tracked there.

456
00:37:44,499 --> 00:37:54,547
[SPEAKER_02]: And then at the beginning of October, we would send out a reminder to principals that like, we're gonna do our, we're gonna start our capital planning process for the annual year.

457
00:37:54,567 --> 00:38:00,091
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if they have anything else, they need to like get those things into the system so we can be considering them.

458
00:38:00,932 --> 00:38:04,315
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in October and November, this committee will meet to like,

459
00:38:05,243 --> 00:38:13,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Sarah Huntley, COB): Make the recommended plan and then in December, we would have an annual committee of the whole where we talked about capital planning and that that way it sort of predates.

460
00:38:13,933 --> 00:38:14,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Sarah Huntley, COB.:

461
00:38:14,314 --> 00:38:25,127
[SPEAKER_02]: : All things budget right and also allows any sort of information that comes out of capital planning that needs to inform the budget to happen and like.

462
00:38:26,129 --> 00:38:34,935
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of queues up if there's a pre-cash need coming and gets us ready for CPC funding if there is a project that we think needs CPC funding.

463
00:38:35,015 --> 00:38:38,938
[SPEAKER_03]: And is that the meeting we're inviting Alicia, the City of Medford to?

464
00:38:39,379 --> 00:38:41,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I think we certainly could invite Alicia.

465
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:53,409
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we should invite her to our subcommittee meeting, especially because I think that is more likely to be happening in her work day, which might be easier for her.

466
00:38:54,509 --> 00:38:56,651
[SPEAKER_02]: And then certainly she wants to come to the Committee of the Whole.

467
00:38:56,791 --> 00:39:01,455
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's sort of what we're talking about in terms of sort of revising our process.

468
00:39:01,535 --> 00:39:03,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that make sense to you?

469
00:39:03,316 --> 00:39:04,898
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes complete sense.

470
00:39:05,038 --> 00:39:15,706
[SPEAKER_00]: You finish up the capital end of February, middle of March maybe, and then you're into your budget cycle.

471
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:18,489
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, perfect.

472
00:39:22,517 --> 00:39:24,979
[SPEAKER_06]: And I- I'm going to need your notes to write this up.

473
00:39:25,339 --> 00:39:26,280
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

474
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,842
[SPEAKER_06]: This is where the audio is coming from.

475
00:39:29,902 --> 00:39:30,843
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's fine.

476
00:39:31,564 --> 00:39:36,027
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think the next step is that- Such as it is.

477
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:40,673
[SPEAKER_02]: We probably can present the process to the committee.

478
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:45,737
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy to write it up after we meet so that everybody knows what to expect.

479
00:39:46,277 --> 00:39:51,261
[SPEAKER_02]: That is actually something that we do need to do in one of our upcoming meetings in June, because that's what we said we would do.

480
00:39:53,183 --> 00:40:02,510
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, Peter, I can pass these old items to you to put into operations hero, and then maybe

481
00:40:05,707 --> 00:40:19,877
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we even like you tell us when you're ready to meet with like sort of everything that you can see pushed in and we can look at what that reporting looks like and tweak it even in advance of this next official cycle.

482
00:40:19,938 --> 00:40:30,125
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would be happy to like do that on Zoom over the summer at some point if there's a time that works for everybody, just so that it happens when things are not quite as chaotic as the beginning of the school year.

483
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:33,628
[SPEAKER_03]: We made a to-do list for Peter of things that he was going to look into.

484
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:35,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

485
00:40:35,489 --> 00:40:37,810
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you need that investigated before?

486
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:46,193
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think we need to investigate it before we tell the committee what the process is, but I think before we meet in the summer, yes.

487
00:40:47,373 --> 00:40:48,334
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that make sense?

488
00:40:48,354 --> 00:40:48,694
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

489
00:40:49,174 --> 00:40:52,436
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I feel like- I welcome summer meetings on this, just so you know.

490
00:40:52,716 --> 00:40:52,836
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

491
00:40:52,936 --> 00:40:54,877
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I'm nuts, but I- No, I understand.

492
00:40:54,897 --> 00:40:57,698
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we do think you're nuts, but that's not really- That's not why.

493
00:41:00,525 --> 00:41:07,227
[SPEAKER_06]: I certainly have enough information to actually draft a policy based on repeating it all for Jerry.

494
00:41:07,267 --> 00:41:08,847
[SPEAKER_06]: So now it's all in my head for sure.

495
00:41:09,828 --> 00:41:14,749
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I can, do we want to have another meeting here or should I just like?

496
00:41:15,629 --> 00:41:23,911
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think we necessarily need to, if you're willing to take a crack at writing the policy on our behalf, I think that's fine.

497
00:41:24,411 --> 00:41:25,311
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I think that the,

498
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:32,765
[SPEAKER_06]: School handbook policy, like that format feels like that would be good for this as well.

499
00:41:33,505 --> 00:41:37,689
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, date ranges, phases, who's responsible.

500
00:41:37,709 --> 00:41:43,755
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, literally a sentence for each phase is sort of like, why are we doing this?

501
00:41:45,877 --> 00:41:48,840
[SPEAKER_06]: And then bullets about the things that will have to happen, so.

502
00:41:50,162 --> 00:41:50,682
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

503
00:41:50,742 --> 00:41:56,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you need any, do we need to include any information about the relationship with building and grounds and or the road?

504
00:41:56,365 --> 00:41:57,165
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll add that in there.

505
00:41:57,185 --> 00:41:57,445
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

506
00:41:57,846 --> 00:42:08,311
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, cause I think we, what we thought was, uh, Terry was that the buildings and ground would sort of like get the projects to, once they are in action, like once they're funded.

507
00:42:08,391 --> 00:42:08,591
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

508
00:42:08,611 --> 00:42:09,171
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

509
00:42:09,191 --> 00:42:09,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

510
00:42:09,511 --> 00:42:09,731
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

511
00:42:15,273 --> 00:42:34,802
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and then, I mean, for some of them, we can, these house doctor contracts are available, so we identify a project, we talk to one of those firms, get a scope of work to do the project management, write any kind of construction documents that are needed.

512
00:42:38,164 --> 00:42:47,855
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the things we talked about earlier was they do the bidding too.

513
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:52,380
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they'd produce the bid documents for the owner to advertise.

514
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:53,841
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's, I like easy.

515
00:42:55,840 --> 00:43:02,591
[SPEAKER_00]: Not cheap, but I mean, but that's what you're going to hold the contractor accountable.

516
00:43:02,851 --> 00:43:05,475
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have to be precise.

517
00:43:06,136 --> 00:43:10,463
[SPEAKER_06]: So one of the things we talked about was, you know, we're going to have the school's capital.

518
00:43:11,284 --> 00:43:39,817
[SPEAKER_06]: plan and you know the Collins Center project document has like just all I mean it's separated but it's still it's like this big mashed pile of capital for the whole community and one of the things I'm curious about if you've seen in other places is like so we have our capital plan and then the city has a capital plan and do we like the budget like the Memphis Public Schools budget will just be

519
00:43:41,058 --> 00:44:00,907
[SPEAKER_06]: school department a number is that kind of what you think happens in other communities where in their capital plan it says school department and a number or do they have our plan sort of like blown out into theirs yeah that well it would be if they do it

520
00:44:01,541 --> 00:44:16,109
[SPEAKER_00]: on an annual basis, so there'd be a list of all the city departments, and the school department would be one of them, and it would list the projects that roll up to a total number that's in the city capital plan.

521
00:44:16,389 --> 00:44:22,573
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, it has to be accepted by the city, so they have the option to say, we don't have the bandwidth to do it.

522
00:44:23,493 --> 00:44:30,637
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's when we kind of, through budget management, we have sufficient money, you know, at the end of the year, we could maybe

523
00:44:31,595 --> 00:44:40,796
[SPEAKER_00]: accommodate a project and kind of spend down our money that falls through the cracks or sometimes it's as you're finding out by the time you go out to bid.

524
00:44:42,447 --> 00:44:44,128
[SPEAKER_00]: you're $100,000 short.

525
00:44:45,048 --> 00:44:53,572
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes it'd be a combination of city operation funds and capital if needed.

526
00:44:53,592 --> 00:44:58,695
[SPEAKER_06]: But the actual spending and all that, your office is essentially who deals with that stuff.

527
00:44:59,975 --> 00:45:03,317
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going back to the definition.

528
00:45:03,457 --> 00:45:09,980
[SPEAKER_06]: So if it's actually capital, it's not in our budget.

529
00:45:11,397 --> 00:45:15,199
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it can be in our budget, but it's how you report it.

530
00:45:15,439 --> 00:45:23,603
[SPEAKER_00]: So the whole end of your report is designed, well, it collects a lot of financial data from across the state.

531
00:45:24,323 --> 00:45:28,825
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's also used for compliance for net school spending.

532
00:45:29,485 --> 00:45:40,173
[SPEAKER_00]: So there'll be DESI publishers on their website, every community's compliance with net school spending, and it determines that compliance from the end-of-year reports.

533
00:45:40,774 --> 00:45:55,205
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we are managing a project and it's over $150,000, in the account classification system, there's one spot where you put

534
00:45:56,133 --> 00:46:00,095
[SPEAKER_00]: the projects that you can charge to school funding.

535
00:46:00,475 --> 00:46:04,977
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's another spot where you put the projects that are outside of school funding.

536
00:46:05,497 --> 00:46:14,620
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's also like large equipment purchases can fall outside of net school spending too.

537
00:46:16,141 --> 00:46:18,302
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad I don't have to do this stuff daily.

538
00:46:20,957 --> 00:46:28,021
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, it just, like, gets into your muscle memory eventually if you're rambling enough.

539
00:46:29,042 --> 00:46:34,024
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can send you the, um, the language that might help you with the policy.

540
00:46:34,324 --> 00:46:34,665
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

541
00:46:35,285 --> 00:46:35,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

542
00:46:37,146 --> 00:46:50,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so it sounds like maybe we just need to make a motion to present our policy and process to the school committee and that member Russo is going to draft on our behalf.

543
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:51,770
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll make that motion.

544
00:46:52,751 --> 00:46:54,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion by Member Eiffel.

545
00:46:54,632 --> 00:46:55,452
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll second that.

546
00:46:55,492 --> 00:46:57,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Seconded by Member Russo.

547
00:46:58,313 --> 00:47:00,474
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we're in person.

548
00:47:00,554 --> 00:47:00,774
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

549
00:47:01,194 --> 00:47:01,855
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

550
00:47:01,875 --> 00:47:01,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

551
00:47:02,315 --> 00:47:02,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

552
00:47:02,715 --> 00:47:03,575
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

553
00:47:03,735 --> 00:47:04,556
[SPEAKER_02]: All those opposed?

554
00:47:04,776 --> 00:47:05,656
[SPEAKER_06]: There's only three of us.

555
00:47:05,696 --> 00:47:06,337
[SPEAKER_06]: Only three of us.

556
00:47:06,397 --> 00:47:07,017
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're good.

557
00:47:07,117 --> 00:47:08,197
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

558
00:47:08,357 --> 00:47:11,999
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I just add a quick update of a major capital project that's going on right now?

559
00:47:13,239 --> 00:47:18,582
[SPEAKER_05]: So the McGlynn Universally Accessible Playground is in the neighborhood of 50% completion.

560
00:47:20,343 --> 00:47:27,252
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's, I hope that members are able to join one of the two tours over the next two weeks.

561
00:47:28,968 --> 00:47:31,109
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really coming out very nicely.

562
00:47:32,569 --> 00:47:42,031
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be a representative project of, I think, what good planning and good community involvement is.

563
00:47:42,371 --> 00:47:45,852
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know Member Graham came last week, so she can speak if she so chooses.

564
00:47:46,372 --> 00:47:52,513
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's also been a tremendous learning experience at a much smaller level.

565
00:47:53,423 --> 00:48:02,653
[SPEAKER_05]: for working with OPMs, working with contractors, the building process as it relates to how a new Medford High School will come about.

566
00:48:02,913 --> 00:48:11,963
[SPEAKER_05]: Just, you know, the amount of detail that we need to have focused on even very littlest things is really going to be critical.

567
00:48:13,041 --> 00:48:17,404
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll just give an example, like alternates, right?

568
00:48:17,504 --> 00:48:29,210
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to make sure that if we're married to something, then there is no alternate and be prepared to spend for that if it comes back at a higher price or understand what the alternates are.

569
00:48:29,831 --> 00:48:33,172
[SPEAKER_05]: There's really nothing that's disappointing in the McGlynn playground.

570
00:48:33,232 --> 00:48:36,374
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just those types of alternates coming through.

571
00:48:37,355 --> 00:48:37,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye.

572
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:43,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it worth making a presentation on this to the MSBA building committee or not yet?

573
00:48:43,701 --> 00:48:48,122
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, or, I mean, I know, I know, I know you did the podcast.

574
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:50,663
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

575
00:48:51,023 --> 00:48:52,844
[SPEAKER_02]: I did see that she did that.

576
00:48:52,884 --> 00:48:53,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

577
00:48:54,644 --> 00:48:55,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah.

578
00:48:55,304 --> 00:48:57,265
[SPEAKER_02]: And I actually got to join the playground last week.

579
00:48:57,705 --> 00:49:01,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and it was awesome.

580
00:49:02,206 --> 00:49:05,007
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe I signed up for Thursday.

581
00:49:05,107 --> 00:49:05,767
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

582
00:49:05,967 --> 00:49:06,907
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm waiting for the official.

583
00:49:08,032 --> 00:49:08,493
[SPEAKER_03]: calendar.

584
00:49:08,753 --> 00:49:09,094
[SPEAKER_03]: You're good.

585
00:49:09,254 --> 00:49:11,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

586
00:49:11,298 --> 00:49:13,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Lisa just said she was going to send one.

587
00:49:14,003 --> 00:49:15,045
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's in my calendar.

588
00:49:15,085 --> 00:49:17,770
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm skipping another meeting for it because it sounds great.

589
00:49:18,051 --> 00:49:19,934
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds way better than whatever meeting that was.

590
00:49:20,595 --> 00:49:24,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, is there a motion to adjourn?

591
00:49:24,803 --> 00:49:25,384
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to adjourn.

592
00:49:25,905 --> 00:49:26,226
[SPEAKER_02]: Second.

593
00:49:26,246 --> 00:49:28,430
[SPEAKER_02]: So seconded by Member Reinfeld.

594
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:29,311
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

595
00:49:29,672 --> 00:49:29,832
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

596
00:49:30,333 --> 00:49:32,577
[SPEAKER_02]: All those opposed?

597
00:49:32,698 --> 00:49:33,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Good night, everyone.

598
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:33,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Good night.
