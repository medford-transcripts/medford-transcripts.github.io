68
00:04:01,054 --> 00:04:05,057
Sincerely, Michael J. McGlynn, mayor and the original signatures on file with the city clerk and

69
00:04:19,573 --> 00:04:22,956
On the motion of approval from Councilor Dela Russo, Councilor Penta.

70
00:04:23,036 --> 00:04:27,880
Mr. President, before we move approval for what you can't, you have to take each item one at a time.

71
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:29,942
That's required by state statute.

72
00:04:30,082 --> 00:04:35,887
Also, earlier tonight at 445, I believe that there was a linkage committee meeting that took place.

73
00:04:36,228 --> 00:04:42,753
And I think you should read the agenda items that were passed on there to put the entire total to close to $1,800,000.

74
00:04:43,034 --> 00:04:45,096
I think it's important.

75
00:04:45,116 --> 00:04:46,657
I think it works hand in hand.

76
00:04:47,058 --> 00:04:47,758
Would you like me to read that?

77
00:04:47,858 --> 00:04:48,118
Please.

78
00:04:48,438 --> 00:04:48,818
Okay.

79
00:04:49,758 --> 00:04:56,080
Item number one was request funds to pay for two year, for year two of the lease on four trucks for water and sewer division.

80
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:03,021
Year one payment previously approved in 2013, approved $26,000 from water slash sewer available linkage funds.

81
00:05:03,101 --> 00:05:09,342
Item two, request funds to pay for stumps and sidewalk repairs caused by pipes, leaks, shutoff repairs.

82
00:05:10,342 --> 00:05:14,343
That line was amended to read water and sewer

83
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:21,818
um, water and saw repairs rather than pipe leaks and shut off repairs.

84
00:05:22,899 --> 00:05:25,621
Approve $100,000 from water and saw available linkage funds.

85
00:05:25,721 --> 00:05:29,365
Item three request funds to pay correct various flooding issues in the city.

86
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:33,868
$250,000 from the water and saw available, available linkage funds.

87
00:05:34,249 --> 00:05:38,292
Item four request funds to pay for year two of lease on two trucks for the highway division.

88
00:05:38,973 --> 00:05:40,494
Year one payment previously approved in 2013.

89
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,802
Approve $22,000 from the roads available linkage funds.

90
00:05:46,002 --> 00:05:51,006
Item five, request funds to pay for year one lease on Bobcat for the highway division.

91
00:05:51,746 --> 00:05:54,308
Approve $10,000 from roads available linkage funds.

92
00:05:55,068 --> 00:05:57,930
Request funds to pay for signage throughout the city for highway division.

93
00:05:58,651 --> 00:06:01,472
Approve $8,000 from the roads linkage funds.

94
00:06:02,033 --> 00:06:09,358
Item seven, request funds to pay for year one lease on two F-250 trucks with snowplow package for the highway division.

95
00:06:10,098 --> 00:06:12,900
Approved $26,000 from ROADS available linkage funds.

96
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,982
The balance in the water slash sewer linkage fund prior to the vote is $675,815.

97
00:06:16,022 --> 00:06:17,843
The balance in the ROADS linkage fund prior to vote is $75,649.

98
00:06:17,883 --> 00:06:22,886
Mr. President, having had these items read, and I think it's important that the taxpayers know that we're talking well in excess of $1,700,000.

99
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:44,968
Um, and as required by law, uh, we should be discussing each one of these, uh, one at a time.

100
00:06:45,388 --> 00:06:47,749
So there's a complete understanding as to what it is.

101
00:06:48,529 --> 00:06:49,969
I'd like to just jump to the link.

102
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:51,409
Did you attend the meeting this afternoon or not?

103
00:06:51,649 --> 00:06:51,950
I did.

104
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:55,610
Um, I'm concerned over two of the items that are on there, Mr. President.

105
00:06:55,770 --> 00:07:03,212
Um, the first one is, um, why are we leasing two trucks for the highway division, uh, for $22,000 a year?

106
00:07:03,332 --> 00:07:06,052
Uh, how much were those trucks each if you had to buy them?

107
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:08,313
And once again, second of all, um,

108
00:07:09,047 --> 00:07:11,890
the one-year lease for an F-250 for $26,000.

109
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:20,978
There's no paperwork that's supplied with this explaining the difference between the leasing and the buying.

110
00:07:21,058 --> 00:07:27,403
And also, leasing the Bobcat for one year at $10,000 a year, how much would that cost if we were to buy it?

111
00:07:28,224 --> 00:07:33,149
We're out there now building a brand new $14 million public works building, state of the art.

112
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:35,631
Point of information?

113
00:07:36,503 --> 00:07:37,344
Councilor DelaRosa.

114
00:07:37,564 --> 00:07:45,269
My question to the chair is, is, uh, the agenda and expenditures of linkage accounts under the purview of the city council.

115
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:51,754
It's, uh, under the purview of the committee, according to the whole new petition that was established years ago.

116
00:07:52,435 --> 00:07:59,940
Plus the fact, Mr. President, since you as the chairperson of the council sit on that committee, I believe it is pertinent and it's relative to the issue at hand.

117
00:08:00,941 --> 00:08:03,343
Um, can we have some explanation, um, from you?

118
00:08:03,383 --> 00:08:06,145
Cause you're the only one either that or is miss Baker here?

119
00:08:06,988 --> 00:08:09,909
or the mayor, um, council Burke is here.

120
00:08:09,929 --> 00:08:12,991
And just for the viewing public, it was an open meeting that was publicly posted.

121
00:08:13,051 --> 00:08:17,232
So any member of the community, as well as city council, a school committee or anyone else could have attended.

122
00:08:17,393 --> 00:08:20,054
So, um, could Ms.

123
00:08:20,074 --> 00:08:20,914
Baker, please be here.

124
00:08:20,954 --> 00:08:21,554
I'd like to have her.

125
00:08:21,594 --> 00:08:22,415
She was, she's a member.

126
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:23,115
Baker is not here.

127
00:08:23,215 --> 00:08:23,875
Oh, she's not here.

128
00:08:24,776 --> 00:08:29,658
Well then can you, on behalf of the council and likeness, why the committee of three voted to

129
00:08:30,397 --> 00:08:31,740
lease rather than by the funds.

130
00:08:32,101 --> 00:08:33,444
What was the reason agenda item?

131
00:08:33,484 --> 00:08:34,947
It's year two of the lease.

132
00:08:35,488 --> 00:08:38,614
These were already purchased by the city of Medford in previous years.

133
00:08:39,216 --> 00:08:41,160
And at this point they have to be paid for.

134
00:08:41,596 --> 00:08:42,597
for year two of the lease.

135
00:08:42,617 --> 00:08:43,518
It's pretty self-explanatory.

136
00:08:43,538 --> 00:08:45,399
No, I'm going to item number seven, Mr. President.

137
00:08:45,419 --> 00:08:46,721
You asked about the two trucks.

138
00:08:46,981 --> 00:08:49,543
Yeah, the two trucks, the two F-150s, two F-250s.

139
00:08:49,603 --> 00:08:50,564
And I just answered that.

140
00:08:50,604 --> 00:08:51,045
No, you didn't.

141
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:52,506
It's year one of the lease.

142
00:08:52,826 --> 00:08:53,226
That's year one.

143
00:08:53,246 --> 00:08:53,527
Number seven.

144
00:08:53,587 --> 00:08:55,228
You also asked about number four.

145
00:08:55,248 --> 00:08:56,610
I didn't say number four.

146
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:58,631
Well, anyway, all right, I apologize.

147
00:08:58,831 --> 00:08:59,492
It's number seven.

148
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:00,853
Why are we leasing?

149
00:09:00,893 --> 00:09:01,554
Why aren't we buying?

150
00:09:02,262 --> 00:09:04,663
The city administration asked us to lease these two vehicles.

151
00:09:04,983 --> 00:09:15,789
If we recall during budget time, they talked about several trucks that were destroyed last year because of, uh, I don't know if it was actual fires or it was a very bad snow removal year.

152
00:09:16,429 --> 00:09:21,332
And, uh, as far as why they chose to go this route, you'll have to ask the city administration that.

153
00:09:21,752 --> 00:09:25,154
Well, since you're a representative and it also talks about a one year lease.

154
00:09:25,674 --> 00:09:28,636
So we're just leasing them for one year or for many years.

155
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:30,617
It's to pay for one year lease.

156
00:09:31,394 --> 00:09:34,416
So we're only going to use these trucks for one year at $26,000 each.

157
00:09:34,836 --> 00:09:38,438
No, this is the first year we're getting the two trucks for the first year payment of $26,000.

158
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:44,322
I don't understand why we're leasing.

159
00:09:45,243 --> 00:09:46,844
This is payment for year one.

160
00:09:47,604 --> 00:10:00,112
When year two comes around, I'm sure there'll be another funding mechanism in place that will either be budgeted through the next fiscal year's budget or the mayor would be coming back to us for funding for year two of the lease, similar to what he did in item number four.

161
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,702
Is our budget director, can she answer the question please?

162
00:10:03,723 --> 00:10:04,343
Number seven.

163
00:10:06,825 --> 00:10:08,246
How many years is this lease for?

164
00:10:08,967 --> 00:10:12,490
It would be four payments over the course of three years.

165
00:10:14,412 --> 00:10:15,132
Four payments of $26,000.

166
00:10:15,172 --> 00:10:15,393
Correct.

167
00:10:15,413 --> 00:10:18,295
So almost $100,000 for this one truck.

168
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:24,132
They're in the 40s with the snowplow package and the lift in the back.

169
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:29,355
For the edification, Madam President, if I may interject, it's not for one truck, counselor.

170
00:10:29,475 --> 00:10:31,356
As the agenda item says, it's for two trucks.

171
00:10:31,997 --> 00:10:33,958
So the $100,000 is divided by two.

172
00:10:33,978 --> 00:10:34,418
Correct.

173
00:10:34,598 --> 00:10:35,959
So I don't want to be misleading to the public.

174
00:10:35,999 --> 00:10:38,361
OK, so why aren't we buying them?

175
00:10:38,401 --> 00:10:45,725
Because the mayor had requested of the linkage committee to lease these trucks, which has been a standard.

176
00:10:45,785 --> 00:10:47,266
We have done that in the past.

177
00:10:47,306 --> 00:10:48,147
We've leased vehicles.

178
00:10:48,227 --> 00:10:50,028
Instead of going out and purchasing them outright.

179
00:10:56,693 --> 00:10:58,554
What does the city get out of leasing them at the end of two years?

180
00:10:59,134 --> 00:10:59,575
Three years?

181
00:11:00,195 --> 00:11:02,976
It's just an option instead of outright buying them on day one.

182
00:11:03,356 --> 00:11:05,457
It's an alternative that many people do.

183
00:11:05,697 --> 00:11:07,058
Many people take loans out.

184
00:11:07,518 --> 00:11:09,419
Many people lease and purchase at the end.

185
00:11:09,479 --> 00:11:10,479
It's an option.

186
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,200
Would it be cheaper for the city?

187
00:11:13,093 --> 00:11:23,978
The interest rates right now are so insignificant that it doesn't make a big difference whether you purchase them outright or you lease them, just like some of the personal vehicles that are out there at 1.5%.

188
00:11:24,019 --> 00:11:25,939
I mean, it's very low interest rate.

189
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,842
And if you jump to number five, why are we renting a Bobcat for $10,000?

190
00:11:31,362 --> 00:11:32,663
It's a similar situation.

191
00:11:32,683 --> 00:11:33,803
We're leasing the Bobcat.

192
00:11:33,863 --> 00:11:35,044
How much does that go for, Brando?

193
00:11:35,124 --> 00:11:37,325
That's about $40,000, a little under $40,000.

194
00:11:38,026 --> 00:11:39,286
And how long are we paying that out for?

195
00:11:39,306 --> 00:11:40,787
It'll be the three-year payment, three.

196
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:46,270
More payments over the course of three years.

197
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:49,232
The last part of the question to this is why this didn't come out of free cash?

198
00:11:49,252 --> 00:11:57,036
Because this is the way that the Mayor requested the money be expended, and we put it before the linkage committee, and they voted earlier this evening.

199
00:11:59,957 --> 00:12:05,120
Can we get a copy of the official minutes forwarded to the Council once they are written up, please?

200
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,961
And once the committee approves it.

201
00:12:07,021 --> 00:12:08,742
And they'll go to your next meeting.

202
00:12:14,856 --> 00:12:15,797
You all set Councilor Penta?

203
00:12:16,057 --> 00:12:16,217
Yep.

204
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:17,138
Thank you.

205
00:12:18,599 --> 00:12:20,340
Councilor Lungo, Kern, and then Councilor Mox.

206
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:28,687
I was on the same issue, if you don't mind, Councilor, um, President Camuso, with regards to leasing, I mean, we're going to have to give it back after four years.

207
00:12:28,727 --> 00:12:30,308
What's the lifespan of these vehicles?

208
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:34,553
I just want to know the pros of leasing versus us buying it outright.

209
00:12:34,573 --> 00:12:37,856
Actually, with the way that we structure it, we'll own it at the end of the lease term.

210
00:12:37,876 --> 00:12:37,996
Oh, OK.

211
00:12:38,016 --> 00:12:38,636
That's what I thought.

212
00:12:38,656 --> 00:12:40,998
So they'll be ours, lock, stock, and barrel.

213
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,342
You'll see some of the trucks that we have on the road are in excess of 10 years old.

214
00:12:45,882 --> 00:12:54,169
So we do, with the maintenance division, with Timmy McCarthy and the work that his team does, they really keep the lights on these trucks.

215
00:12:54,389 --> 00:12:58,032
And there's just some that are just, they've reached their end life.

216
00:12:58,712 --> 00:13:05,833
And as Council President Camuso mentioned, one of them during the blizzard last year actually overheated and caught on fire.

217
00:13:05,853 --> 00:13:08,034
So one of the trucks would be replacing that vehicle as well.

218
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:14,855
So with regards to the four years that we are leasing, the pros, what kind of pros, if something happens to the vehicle?

219
00:13:14,935 --> 00:13:16,476
I mean, just like if you lease a car.

220
00:13:16,516 --> 00:13:17,596
They're ours.

221
00:13:18,056 --> 00:13:19,916
We're responsible for them.

222
00:13:20,036 --> 00:13:21,617
It's really just the payment structure.

223
00:13:22,057 --> 00:13:24,457
So if one breaks down, we are responsible.

224
00:13:24,477 --> 00:13:26,538
We have the warranty that would come with a purchase.

225
00:13:26,558 --> 00:13:27,298
It would be the same.

226
00:13:27,618 --> 00:13:28,278
Same as a purchase.

227
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:30,270
Councilor Marks?

228
00:13:31,051 --> 00:13:34,653
I also have a question on that, too, if you wouldn't mind.

229
00:13:34,693 --> 00:13:39,957
So the $26,000 for year one, that includes the eventual buyout after year four?

230
00:13:40,077 --> 00:13:40,297
Yes.

231
00:13:41,057 --> 00:13:42,618
And what percent is that?

232
00:13:43,539 --> 00:13:44,139
It's an equal.

233
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,401
It ends up being the four payments.

234
00:13:46,741 --> 00:13:50,663
So on delivery, you make the first payment, and then 12 months later is the second.

235
00:13:50,964 --> 00:13:55,827
So it ends up being within a three-year period, but it's four payments.

236
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:58,971
Just the final payment is the buyout.

237
00:13:58,991 --> 00:13:59,951
So the buyout's roughly $26,000?

238
00:14:00,051 --> 00:14:02,732
It's roughly a fourth, correct.

239
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:07,094
And you're saying we've done this for a lot of pieces of equipment in the past?

240
00:14:07,134 --> 00:14:13,177
Yeah, we've done this with several, and we did it recently with some of the police cars, and then we've done it for a host of different vehicles.

241
00:14:13,197 --> 00:14:13,877
Since the 80s.

242
00:14:14,717 --> 00:14:17,398
Yeah, we've always, we've done it quite frequently.

243
00:14:17,418 --> 00:14:21,700
Just to keep the upfront costs low.

244
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:25,622
Yeah, just balances it, spreads the payments versus putting it all out at once.

245
00:14:29,859 --> 00:14:30,719
Councilor DelaRusso.

246
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:32,500
Thank you, Mr. President.

247
00:14:36,082 --> 00:14:36,782
Councilor Penta.

248
00:14:37,522 --> 00:14:42,104
Mr. President, let's go to number two, request funds to pay for stumps and sidewalks, $100,000.

249
00:14:42,905 --> 00:14:47,727
Now I'm confused because in the mayor's other request from free cash, he wants 400,000.

250
00:14:49,147 --> 00:14:50,668
Why this didn't all just come from one account?

251
00:14:51,696 --> 00:14:54,078
$300,000 is actually the paper was changed.

252
00:14:54,258 --> 00:15:02,163
The total was supposed to be $400,000, $300,000 for free cash, and the $100,000 from linkage, which is attributable to water issues.

253
00:15:02,283 --> 00:15:10,209
So if a main, when you pull out a main and you dig up the sidewalk to get to it, those sidewalks would be repaired through this account.

254
00:15:10,629 --> 00:15:13,171
So the $400,000 in free cash should be free?

255
00:15:13,411 --> 00:15:16,713
Which is changed in your, I believe, in your documents.

256
00:15:16,753 --> 00:15:18,594
No, I didn't get that.

257
00:15:18,614 --> 00:15:19,415
The total is correct.

258
00:15:19,475 --> 00:15:20,936
It should be just three in the bottom of it.

259
00:15:22,135 --> 00:15:24,576
The bottom line number of 1, 3, 8, 6 is still correct.

260
00:15:26,397 --> 00:15:30,139
Stumps and sidewalks has been amended to read 300 in the council paper.

261
00:15:30,199 --> 00:15:30,439
Correct.

262
00:15:33,941 --> 00:15:36,462
On the motion of councilor DelaRusso for approval.

263
00:15:37,122 --> 00:15:38,102
For approval of what?

264
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:41,284
Uh, paper 14-743.

265
00:15:41,544 --> 00:15:45,706
That particular paper has to be voted on individually.

266
00:15:45,846 --> 00:15:48,227
Each item, Mr. President, that's what the law reads.

267
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:49,788
It's a cost factor.

268
00:15:51,615 --> 00:15:56,578
This is one paper submitted by the administration and it has items broken down and it's broken down.

269
00:15:56,618 --> 00:15:57,119
That's correct.

270
00:15:57,619 --> 00:16:00,341
Um, name and address for the record.

271
00:16:00,381 --> 00:16:01,622
Gene Martin 10 coming street.

272
00:16:02,202 --> 00:16:06,625
Um, there are some items here that I see is non essential.

273
00:16:07,285 --> 00:16:18,853
Um, and the reason why I bring that up is because we have an essential need in this city and it's the police station, which is nowhere to be found as seven years from now is too long.

274
00:16:20,016 --> 00:16:20,817
It's not acceptable.

275
00:16:20,877 --> 00:16:23,760
Seven years from now is not acceptable for a new police station.

276
00:16:26,232 --> 00:16:28,213
Point of information, Councilor Mayne.

277
00:16:28,233 --> 00:16:34,037
If we look at the text of the paper, we'll see that there is an item in there, plans for HDQT renovations.

278
00:16:34,777 --> 00:16:43,342
And I believe that that is an appropriation of $17,000 to take a look at a design for a female locker room for our women officers.

279
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:43,883
I did see that.

280
00:16:43,903 --> 00:16:45,824
There's also some other.

281
00:16:45,844 --> 00:16:47,064
But wait a minute now.

282
00:16:47,084 --> 00:16:49,906
Commitment in there for, if you can let me give me a second to take a look at my notes.

283
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:52,888
There's a couple others too that are essential.

284
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:54,813
The evidence as well.

285
00:16:54,833 --> 00:17:02,217
That's going to include the evidence room and moving the fire engines out.

286
00:17:02,237 --> 00:17:04,098
You're correct.

287
00:17:04,659 --> 00:17:05,239
Hang on a second.

288
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:06,340
You are correct.

289
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,222
I see some things that are not essential.

290
00:17:09,302 --> 00:17:11,143
I don't see all things that are non-essential.

291
00:17:11,523 --> 00:17:12,564
But I see a bike lane.

292
00:17:13,404 --> 00:17:17,147
I see, believe it or not, and I know you're going to be against me on this, playgrounds.

293
00:17:18,127 --> 00:17:19,128
These are non-essentials.

294
00:17:19,568 --> 00:17:21,850
If you're going to put pressure on the mayor,

295
00:17:22,656 --> 00:17:28,205
who has all authority to change this, to sign off on this, and you've got to build up pressure in this city.

296
00:17:28,766 --> 00:17:29,727
I'm sorry, but you do.

297
00:17:30,268 --> 00:17:34,655
If you don't build up pressure with the citizens to get them in here, to get them angry,

298
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:38,852
then you can explain to them that the police station needs to come first, and then they can have their playgrounds.

299
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:44,596
Because if you keep on doing this one million at a time, you're never going to see a police station.

300
00:17:44,616 --> 00:17:45,917
You're going to give him what he wants.

301
00:17:46,277 --> 00:17:48,458
So if there's a bucket truck, that's a necessity.

302
00:17:48,959 --> 00:17:50,500
If there's a plow, that's a necessity.

303
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:53,662
But if it's a bike lane, it's not a necessity.

304
00:17:54,202 --> 00:17:59,926
If it's a playground, I understand they can be dangerous, but you're going to have to do something.

305
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:03,748
So you guys can disagree with me if you want,

306
00:18:04,182 --> 00:18:07,745
But this is the only time that you're going to be able to have leverage over the mayor.

307
00:18:08,866 --> 00:18:09,727
And it's up to you.

308
00:18:10,327 --> 00:18:10,988
It's your call.

309
00:18:11,468 --> 00:18:12,009
It's your vote.

310
00:18:12,649 --> 00:18:16,612
But when the police station doesn't get built, don't come looking for me.

311
00:18:17,073 --> 00:18:17,393
Thank you.

312
00:18:18,614 --> 00:18:18,934
Thank you.

313
00:18:21,316 --> 00:18:21,837
Mr. President.

314
00:18:22,337 --> 00:18:23,178
Councilor Penta.

315
00:18:23,218 --> 00:18:27,642
Can we take the items one at a time and just... If the council wishes, you can press us.

316
00:18:28,705 --> 00:18:29,505
You can ask for a severance.

317
00:18:30,126 --> 00:18:35,048
But the ruling of the chair is if the council can ask for a severance.

318
00:18:35,589 --> 00:18:39,871
But as far as this paper, it's not individually going into separate accounts.

319
00:18:39,931 --> 00:18:43,833
It's one paper from certified free cash for a specific purpose.

320
00:18:44,533 --> 00:18:47,555
It's not actually putting it into one account to another at this point.

321
00:18:48,015 --> 00:18:49,356
So that's the ruling of the chair.

322
00:18:49,396 --> 00:18:54,599
But if the council wishes to sever each one and there's a majority of members that want that, we certainly can do that.

323
00:18:54,679 --> 00:18:58,561
Well, I think the taxpayers are owed the obligation of knowing

324
00:18:58,965 --> 00:19:05,329
how this money is going to be spent, whether it's severed or not, whether the total stays the same, or whether it's lessened by some amount.

325
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:10,172
I think it's important that each item is discussed, and the Council can take its vote.

326
00:19:10,352 --> 00:19:11,633
You can make a motion to sever?

327
00:19:11,653 --> 00:19:13,354
I make a motion to sever every one of the items.

328
00:19:13,574 --> 00:19:15,295
There is a motion to sever, Councillor DelaRusso.

329
00:19:18,998 --> 00:19:20,619
Okay, Councillor Longo-Kern.

330
00:19:20,639 --> 00:19:21,619
Thank you, President Camuso.

331
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,761
Since we are severing, I was... Well, we're going to take a vote to sever it.

332
00:19:24,801 --> 00:19:25,962
If it passes, we'll sever it.

333
00:19:26,022 --> 00:19:27,543
If it doesn't, we won't sever it.

334
00:19:29,846 --> 00:19:38,475
The first two items, if we could just get an explanation on the first two items that were discussed earlier, but if we could get it discussed also.

335
00:19:38,495 --> 00:19:43,540
The parapet and the mausoleum.

336
00:19:46,373 --> 00:19:51,415
Mr. President, councilors, thank you for entertaining these free cash appropriations this evening.

337
00:19:52,035 --> 00:20:01,639
As you know earlier, tonight at 5 o'clock we had a meeting to go over some of the papers, well, all of the line items that are included in the two papers that are before you this evening.

338
00:20:02,439 --> 00:20:03,640
The mayor went into detail on.

339
00:20:05,241 --> 00:20:08,905
I will try to do my best to explain any questions that you may have.

340
00:20:09,406 --> 00:20:12,189
But I know the first one is the City Hall parapet.

341
00:20:12,309 --> 00:20:22,380
If you look up at the roof of this building, to me it almost looks like a concrete fence that goes around the top of the facade.

342
00:20:25,247 --> 00:20:27,189
We've been having inspections done.

343
00:20:27,469 --> 00:20:28,170
There's a plan.

344
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:35,217
We're trying to get some estimates to see whether we need partial roofing repairs because obviously we have a little leak in this building.

345
00:20:38,372 --> 00:20:48,079
An engineer came out and walked the roof with Mr. Moki, the building commissioner, and he said that in order to get through the winter for safety purposes, we should wrap it.

346
00:20:48,239 --> 00:20:57,847
It's similar if you took notice, you may not have even noticed it, but the firehouse on Salem Street, before they were able to actually do the brickwork on the clock tower,

347
00:20:58,487 --> 00:21:06,350
They covered it with a like a black mesh wrapping and it kind of blended in I think after a few days people probably didn't even take notice that it was up there.

348
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:10,431
But it's a protective measure to hold everything in so that nothing comes over the side.

349
00:21:10,871 --> 00:21:18,073
So that's what we got an estimate from the engineering company on what it would cost to wrap the building for the winter and that's the $20,000.

350
00:21:19,234 --> 00:21:23,355
So that wrapping would be along the fencing or along the whole top of the

351
00:21:23,921 --> 00:21:30,685
It would, all of the parapet, which is the decorative feature at the top, it would go around the top.

352
00:21:31,066 --> 00:21:32,667
And that would last just for this one winter?

353
00:21:32,687 --> 00:21:34,948
It's just a temporary measure to get us to the spring.

354
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:43,894
And in the spring, we're going to have to take that off, and if we don't do anything next year, we're going to have to do another wrapping?

355
00:21:43,914 --> 00:21:46,736
Well, we would take it off in order to fix it.

356
00:21:46,896 --> 00:21:48,897
We wouldn't take it off if we weren't fixing it.

357
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,962
What are the estimates to fix it?

358
00:21:51,202 --> 00:21:58,569
Like they told us at the fire station, they said that some people, it's supposed to be a temporary measure, but some end up leaving it up for 10 years or so.

359
00:21:58,949 --> 00:22:00,111
That's not the intent here.

360
00:22:00,171 --> 00:22:02,513
It really is to get us through the winter.

361
00:22:02,593 --> 00:22:08,979
We have an engineering firm looking at the roof at present, along with a roofing company is going to do a

362
00:22:12,168 --> 00:22:18,031
They have the guns, the guns that see through to see where there are leaks present.

363
00:22:18,051 --> 00:22:19,592
They're conducting that as well.

364
00:22:19,732 --> 00:22:24,014
So it's in process and hopefully we'll have some estimates in the very near future.

365
00:22:24,314 --> 00:22:28,376
So we have no idea what exactly is needed or how much it would cost?

366
00:22:29,136 --> 00:22:34,158
If it's limited roofing, it's not going to be that tremendous of a cost.

367
00:22:34,918 --> 00:22:37,320
If it's major, then that's a whole other...

368
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:43,905
And the parapet itself, there are pieces, sections of it that are weaker.

369
00:22:43,925 --> 00:22:47,270
A lot of it is very strong, but there are sections that are weaker.

370
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:54,519
So what we've been talking to in order to compare, we want to have the original is a terracotta actually.

371
00:22:55,140 --> 00:23:08,611
So we want to look at what the cost is to do it that way, and we're getting others that are telling us to be wise and for, so there's no maintenance free, is to go with some of the acrylics that they're putting together now that look aged and look appropriate.

372
00:23:08,911 --> 00:23:13,015
But that hasn't, those are just people discussing different options that we'll have.

373
00:23:13,055 --> 00:23:15,517
So we're in the preliminary stages of that.

374
00:23:15,988 --> 00:23:19,749
And if we don't happen to do something for two, three years, you will leave the wrapping up?

375
00:23:19,789 --> 00:23:20,830
We would leave the wrapping up.

376
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:22,210
That is not the intent.

377
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:25,571
Hopefully the council feels the same way once we get our estimates in.

378
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:31,313
And then I don't know if anybody else has questions on that one.

379
00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:33,374
If we're going to go through this one at a time.

380
00:23:34,214 --> 00:23:35,635
Well, if it votes that way, we will.

381
00:23:35,655 --> 00:23:38,696
Is there a motion to SEVA?

382
00:23:39,236 --> 00:23:42,077
There is a motion to SEVA that's been submitted.

383
00:23:42,097 --> 00:23:43,197
Are you all set, council?

384
00:23:44,298 --> 00:23:45,338
I'm all set with that one, yep.

385
00:23:46,433 --> 00:23:46,953
Councilor Knight.

386
00:23:47,494 --> 00:23:48,775
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

387
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:54,278
I was able to speak with some members of the administration prior to tonight's committee of the whole meeting.

388
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:57,001
And I also attended the Committee of the Whole meeting this evening.

389
00:23:57,501 --> 00:24:00,162
And based upon what's presented, I think this is a very good plan.

390
00:24:00,182 --> 00:24:05,424
I think if we look at what's before us here, we have a paper that provides for 15 vehicles.

391
00:24:06,004 --> 00:24:10,225
It provides for a number of equipment upgrades and a number of infrastructure upgrades.

392
00:24:10,666 --> 00:24:16,127
It addresses some flooding issues that are really bothering some residents and creating some problems for their personal property.

393
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:23,650
Technology upgrades, there's some parks and recreation upgrades, public safety upgrades, a commitment to, a continued commitment to the arts, Mr. President.

394
00:24:24,366 --> 00:24:25,708
Overall, I think this is a great package.

395
00:24:25,769 --> 00:24:29,356
I can understand how some of the councils would want to go through this one by one.

396
00:24:29,717 --> 00:24:34,306
However, my view after attending the two meetings, having discussions with it prior to tonight,

397
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:40,091
And taking a look at the comprehensive package, I really think it's a nice deal for the community.

398
00:24:40,131 --> 00:24:41,931
It's a great way to invest in the community.

399
00:24:41,952 --> 00:24:43,632
I mean, we're looking at 15 vehicles.

400
00:24:43,652 --> 00:24:46,833
We're looking at security cameras, which this council has requested before.

401
00:24:47,453 --> 00:24:50,633
Movable speed bumps that can be placed in certain areas of concern.

402
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:55,914
Mr. President, LED conversion to lights that are going to be more energy efficient and brighter in our square.

403
00:24:56,234 --> 00:24:59,495
So I really think that this is a good plan, Mr. President.

404
00:24:59,515 --> 00:25:00,275
I'm going to be supporting it.

405
00:25:01,075 --> 00:25:01,416
All right.

406
00:25:01,436 --> 00:25:03,476
At this point, there is a motion to sever.

407
00:25:04,244 --> 00:25:09,608
clerk will call the roll and this is to sever each item on this individually for a vote of approval.

408
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:10,449
Yay or nay?

409
00:25:12,871 --> 00:25:14,612
Councilor Penta for the voters call.

410
00:25:14,712 --> 00:25:25,081
And since there are a lot of items in here that will have an impact in certain parts of the community and especially for which a rate payers and taxpayers in this community aren't aware of.

411
00:25:25,741 --> 00:25:29,404
And as council a night is just alluded to, he thinks it's a great package.

412
00:25:29,464 --> 00:25:31,566
So I would assume there'd be no problem discussing it.

413
00:25:32,125 --> 00:25:35,706
and letting the taxpayers know what they're getting by dollar amount to each and every one of the items.

414
00:25:36,126 --> 00:25:39,487
So I support the, uh, I support the, uh, severing of the motion.

415
00:25:39,927 --> 00:25:40,287
Okay.

416
00:25:40,707 --> 00:25:41,567
Clerk, we'll call the roll.

417
00:25:41,627 --> 00:25:41,807
Yes.

418
00:25:41,867 --> 00:25:46,309
Vote is to sever a no vote is to not sever and vote on the package as presented.

419
00:25:47,189 --> 00:25:48,129
14 dash seven, four, three.

420
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:51,490
Vice-president Caviello.

421
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:53,610
Councilor DelaRusso.

422
00:25:54,531 --> 00:25:56,731
Councilor Knight.

423
00:25:56,831 --> 00:25:57,051
Yes.

424
00:25:57,831 --> 00:25:58,432
Councilor Mox.

425
00:25:58,732 --> 00:25:58,872
Yes.

426
00:25:59,352 --> 00:25:59,972
Councilor Penta.

427
00:26:00,032 --> 00:26:00,232
Yes.

428
00:26:01,036 --> 00:26:01,676
President commercial.

429
00:26:01,937 --> 00:26:04,198
No, by three yeses for nose.

430
00:26:04,579 --> 00:26:07,381
The paper is going to be voted on as presented.

431
00:26:07,561 --> 00:26:15,647
Point of information, Mr. President point of information under rule 20 of our city council talks about items appearing upon the council agenda.

432
00:26:15,827 --> 00:26:25,714
Point number four, any financial paper appearing on the council agenda for the first time shall be automatically laid on the table for one week when such action is requested by any counselor.

433
00:26:26,135 --> 00:26:29,377
I am the counselor and I'm making that action that the paper lay on the table.

434
00:26:29,898 --> 00:26:31,059
according to our own rules.

435
00:26:31,999 --> 00:26:33,661
You can take a vote.

436
00:26:34,001 --> 00:26:34,961
No, it's automatic.

437
00:26:37,003 --> 00:26:37,623
Lays on the table.

438
00:26:38,564 --> 00:26:38,944
Roll number 20.

439
00:26:39,044 --> 00:26:45,629
It's right there.

440
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:53,394
I don't think there's any problem discussing, and I don't know why four colleagues would not want to discuss some of this matter.

441
00:26:53,814 --> 00:26:55,155
And pardon me.

442
00:26:56,243 --> 00:26:56,703
We had a meeting.

443
00:26:56,763 --> 00:26:58,984
Well, you were at a meeting that the public couldn't see.

444
00:26:59,504 --> 00:27:00,344
It was a private meeting.

445
00:27:00,364 --> 00:27:01,244
With all due respect.

446
00:27:01,424 --> 00:27:02,404
It was a committee of the whole meeting.

447
00:27:02,424 --> 00:27:02,484
Yes.

448
00:27:02,504 --> 00:27:03,124
That's correct.

449
00:27:03,424 --> 00:27:03,624
Yes.

450
00:27:03,644 --> 00:27:07,005
To say the public couldn't see it is disingenuous and not truthful.

451
00:27:07,305 --> 00:27:08,605
There was members of the public there.

452
00:27:09,245 --> 00:27:10,586
But this is the public right here.

453
00:27:10,626 --> 00:27:12,266
There was members of the public at the meeting.

454
00:27:12,286 --> 00:27:14,866
You just said that members of the public couldn't be there.

455
00:27:15,186 --> 00:27:15,907
That is wrong.

456
00:27:16,047 --> 00:27:16,727
It's not true.

457
00:27:16,807 --> 00:27:17,627
And I'm correcting it.

458
00:27:17,647 --> 00:27:19,307
Well, some members of the public was put there.

459
00:27:19,407 --> 00:27:20,027
No, no, no, no, no, no.

460
00:27:20,147 --> 00:27:23,088
Some members of the public, which would be the people who watched this.

461
00:27:24,129 --> 00:27:27,522
All members of the public were able to attend the meeting.

462
00:27:28,958 --> 00:27:30,418
were able to attend the meeting.

463
00:27:30,798 --> 00:27:31,959
So let's not say that.

464
00:27:32,619 --> 00:27:33,339
I said some.

465
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:35,059
You said, councillor.

466
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:36,420
And I just corrected myself.

467
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,920
And I corrected it for you.

468
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,020
You didn't correct it for me.

469
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:49,462
So we do have rule number 20 that says any finance paper appearing on the council agenda for the first time shall be automatically laid on the table for one week when such action is requested by any councillor.

470
00:27:49,942 --> 00:27:51,243
The councillor has requested that.

471
00:27:51,263 --> 00:27:52,403
There's a motion to table.

472
00:27:53,063 --> 00:27:53,823
All those in favor?

473
00:27:53,843 --> 00:27:57,224
It's automatic, Paul.

474
00:27:57,763 --> 00:27:58,303
It's automatic.

475
00:27:58,323 --> 00:27:59,224
It's automatic.

476
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:00,845
You're asked to lay on the table.

477
00:28:01,245 --> 00:28:02,086
No, it's laid on the table.

478
00:28:02,106 --> 00:28:02,927
We'll see that next week.

479
00:28:02,987 --> 00:28:03,487
Madam president.

480
00:28:04,007 --> 00:28:04,848
Madam vice director.

481
00:28:05,689 --> 00:28:06,029
Thank you.

482
00:28:06,649 --> 00:28:10,752
Well, the motion of council Della Russo to revert back to the regular order of business council Lungo Kern.

483
00:28:10,852 --> 00:28:12,974
There was another paper as well.

484
00:28:14,815 --> 00:28:19,218
If we're tabling it, I mean, can I just ask some questions?

485
00:28:19,238 --> 00:28:21,279
That paper has been tabled.

486
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,141
There is another paper, which 14,

487
00:28:26,782 --> 00:28:30,965
7-4-4.

488
00:28:31,025 --> 00:28:46,158
Mr. President, members of the City Council, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approve the appropriation of certified free cash in the amount of $90,000 for structural repairs to the Carriage House, in addition to various roofing and sprinkler repairs at the Brooks Estates, a representative from M-Belt,

489
00:28:47,193 --> 00:28:50,675
will be in attendance to answer any questions you may have.

490
00:28:52,475 --> 00:29:02,420
If I may, if I may first, I know if I may through the chair, Councilor Custo, I'm assuming that somebody is going to move to possibly table this as well to keep in line.

491
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:12,684
But if I could just, if we could get a specific breakdown of the 90,000, what, what the estimates have come in, um, for the, for the sprinkler system.

492
00:29:13,004 --> 00:29:16,666
I think there's, I think Mr. Lincoln named about five different,

493
00:29:17,274 --> 00:29:21,095
areas that have improvements that will be used with this 90,000.

494
00:29:21,135 --> 00:29:27,077
So if we could get a breakdown specifically on a dollar figure for each, each portion and what estimates came in.

495
00:29:27,257 --> 00:29:32,239
Thank you.

496
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:41,722
My effort to intervene here was to make a motion for approval.

497
00:29:43,383 --> 00:29:44,783
We have a motion for approval on the floor.

498
00:29:45,449 --> 00:29:46,649
can't, it's been laid on the table.

499
00:29:47,029 --> 00:29:48,990
You asked what to be laid on the table?

500
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:49,970
It's on the table, rule 20.

501
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:52,351
It's two separate papers.

502
00:29:52,551 --> 00:29:53,611
There's two separate papers.

503
00:29:53,911 --> 00:29:56,672
Are you asking for this paper to also be laid on the table?

504
00:29:56,752 --> 00:29:56,952
Yes.

505
00:29:58,073 --> 00:29:58,333
Rule 20.

506
00:29:59,033 --> 00:29:59,233
Rule 20.

507
00:29:59,813 --> 00:30:02,074
Counselor Penta has asked for rule 20.

508
00:30:02,414 --> 00:30:04,715
So this paper will be tabled to next week.

509
00:30:06,935 --> 00:30:07,415
Sorry, Tom.

510
00:30:08,516 --> 00:30:09,496
Sorry, Mr. President.

511
00:30:12,897 --> 00:30:13,217
Okay.

00:32:45,245 --> 00:32:46,747
In the City Clerk's Office, 781-393-2425.

534
00:32:46,787 --> 00:32:47,227
We have a motion.

535
00:32:47,267 --> 00:32:48,569
Who has those papers?

536
00:32:48,589 --> 00:32:51,872
All those in favor?

537
00:32:51,892 --> 00:32:54,775
Anyone want to speak in favor of this motion?

538
00:33:06,677 --> 00:33:07,638
Name and address of the rector, please.

539
00:33:08,639 --> 00:33:09,039
Good evening.

540
00:33:09,079 --> 00:33:10,440
My name is Earl Lawson.

541
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:14,603
I'm the project coordinator for Comcast 9B Forbes Road in Woburn.

542
00:33:15,464 --> 00:33:21,969
This is to install a conduit across Hall Street that serves a residential home at 75 Governor's Ave.

543
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:26,833
They presently have an aerial drop that goes across the street, but they want to go underground.

544
00:33:27,374 --> 00:33:30,036
So this is to take care of that aerial drop for this customer.

545
00:33:30,556 --> 00:33:30,876
Thank you.

546
00:33:31,777 --> 00:33:32,077
Thank you.

547
00:33:32,558 --> 00:33:33,539
Any more in favor of this project?

548
00:33:35,635 --> 00:33:38,717
Hearing none, seeing none, anyone opposed to this project?

549
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:46,483
Hearing none, seeing none, motion passes.

550
00:33:49,065 --> 00:33:50,546
Motion to approve by Councilor Rossell.

551
00:33:51,407 --> 00:33:51,867
All in favor?

552
00:33:51,967 --> 00:33:52,067
Aye.

553
00:33:53,849 --> 00:33:54,329
Aye.

554
00:33:54,569 --> 00:33:54,990
Opposed?

555
00:33:55,010 --> 00:34:00,674
Ayes have it.

556
00:34:00,774 --> 00:34:02,375
Thank you, Vice President Carviello.

557
00:34:04,253 --> 00:34:08,036
Uh, I want to apologize as the chair, the last paper that we're just tabled.

558
00:34:08,657 --> 00:34:12,440
Uh, if there's a motion to bring them back before us, uh, we will entertain them this evening.

559
00:34:16,803 --> 00:34:21,667
Is that a motion council DelaRusso on the motion of council DelaRusso to take the papers back to us.

560
00:34:22,828 --> 00:34:23,569
All those in favor.

561
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:26,011
Councilor Penta.

562
00:34:26,031 --> 00:34:27,612
We were under suspension of the rules.

563
00:34:27,872 --> 00:34:29,854
All rules were suspended at the time of the vote.

564
00:34:30,014 --> 00:34:31,375
The paper can be back before us.

565
00:34:32,793 --> 00:34:36,216
Yes, there was a vote of suspension of the rules by Councillor Knight.

566
00:34:36,236 --> 00:34:38,098
That is the chair's ruling.

567
00:34:38,218 --> 00:34:42,022
The paper is back before us if the council wants to see it.

568
00:34:42,543 --> 00:34:43,584
You can doubt the ruling of the chair.

569
00:34:43,624 --> 00:34:46,987
The ruling of the chair is in doubt.

570
00:34:47,568 --> 00:34:52,553
The ruling will be called if a yes vote will be to

571
00:34:53,354 --> 00:35:04,560
Um, a yes vote will be to say that we were not under suspension of the rules and a no vote on the challenge of the chair will acknowledge that we were indeed under suspension of the rules and therefore the rules were out.

572
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:07,981
So a yes vote is for Councilor Pinter's motion.

573
00:35:08,121 --> 00:35:11,303
A no vote is the ruling of the chair to support the chair.

574
00:35:11,723 --> 00:35:12,684
The clerk will call the roll.

575
00:35:15,385 --> 00:35:17,126
You want a question before the roll is called?

576
00:35:18,306 --> 00:35:20,067
Well, we have to find out if it's back before us first.

577
00:35:20,488 --> 00:35:21,408
So we have to rule on the chair.

578
00:35:23,956 --> 00:35:26,179
All right, I'm going to explain this.

579
00:35:28,101 --> 00:35:34,048
When we first opened up the order of business, a member of the Medford City Council asked for suspension of the rules.

580
00:35:35,089 --> 00:35:38,212
All members of this council acknowledged that we would go under suspension of the rules.

581
00:35:38,273 --> 00:35:41,757
Therefore, rule number 20 in every other rule of the Medford City Council

582
00:35:42,831 --> 00:35:43,512
is suspended.

583
00:35:43,912 --> 00:35:45,313
It's clear as day when you think about it.

584
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:47,554
This is, uh, we suspended our own rules.

585
00:35:48,095 --> 00:35:49,816
So I actually ruled wrong on the paper.

586
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:54,780
Council DelaRusso asked for the paper to be back before us as a result of being under suspension of the rules.

587
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,100
And we're here now.

588
00:35:56,181 --> 00:35:59,263
So a yes vote is to

589
00:36:00,556 --> 00:36:02,758
Uphold Councillor Penter's motion.

590
00:36:03,278 --> 00:36:11,164
A no vote is to stand by the chair that we were indeed under suspension of the rules originally when these papers were before us.

591
00:36:11,584 --> 00:36:11,824
Yes?

592
00:36:11,844 --> 00:36:22,792
We never took an official vote on that to lay it on the table for one week.

593
00:36:23,773 --> 00:36:24,013
We did.

594
00:36:24,053 --> 00:36:24,493
We didn't.

595
00:36:25,294 --> 00:36:26,575
It was a mechanism of the rules.

596
00:36:31,384 --> 00:36:33,065
call for reconsideration.

597
00:36:33,286 --> 00:36:34,306
It's not reconsideration.

598
00:36:34,326 --> 00:36:35,807
He wasn't on the prevailing side.

599
00:36:36,247 --> 00:36:37,028
We never took a vote.

600
00:36:37,308 --> 00:36:37,628
We didn't.

601
00:36:38,069 --> 00:36:38,269
Right.

602
00:36:38,309 --> 00:36:40,770
So ruling of the chair originally was wrong.

603
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:42,411
We were under suspension of the rules council.

604
00:36:42,431 --> 00:36:43,232
We're going to take the vote.

605
00:36:44,933 --> 00:36:45,633
Councilor Penta.

606
00:36:46,013 --> 00:36:53,678
One thing further under rule 20, number one, all items of business appearing upon the council agenda shall be taken up in the order of their appearance and be fully in.

607
00:36:54,218 --> 00:36:56,860
And the appearance was under suspension and be fully and openly debated

608
00:36:57,142 --> 00:37:01,866
and disposed of by a vote of the council previous to consideration of any other item of business.

609
00:37:02,126 --> 00:37:04,168
And then we jumped to rule four for which is mine.

610
00:37:05,008 --> 00:37:06,269
So it lays on the table.

611
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:09,292
The council took this no matter how it appeared before the council.

612
00:37:09,632 --> 00:37:10,613
It doesn't make any difference.

613
00:37:11,294 --> 00:37:11,694
Counselor.

614
00:37:12,265 --> 00:37:14,246
We're going to take a vote on your challenge.

615
00:37:14,727 --> 00:37:15,147
It's simple.

616
00:37:15,167 --> 00:37:19,070
If we were under suspension of the rules, your rule would be valid, would not be valid.

617
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:23,073
If we were not under suspension of the rules, then we would be standing by your rule.

618
00:37:23,113 --> 00:37:23,973
The chair will call the roll.

619
00:37:23,993 --> 00:37:25,394
A yes vote is for Councilor Penta.

620
00:37:25,955 --> 00:37:27,416
A no vote is to uphold the chair.

621
00:37:27,796 --> 00:37:28,917
The clerk will call the roll.

622
00:37:31,098 --> 00:37:33,260
Before the roll is called, Councilor Marks.

623
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:40,585
With all due respect, Mr. President, there were 25 items on the list that the mayor was asking for approval.

624
00:37:41,611 --> 00:37:45,212
If we went through them one at a time, we would have been done by now.

625
00:37:45,992 --> 00:37:47,153
We would have gone through them all by now.

626
00:37:47,173 --> 00:37:49,894
We're going to take a ruling on the chair, and then we're going to proceed.

627
00:37:49,914 --> 00:37:55,275
Because if your ruling is upheld by Councilor Penta, the clerk will call the roll on the chair.

628
00:37:55,795 --> 00:38:00,697
There's going to be no debate.

629
00:38:00,717 --> 00:38:04,058
The debate, the point is moved.

630
00:38:04,158 --> 00:38:07,539
If Councilor Penta prevails, you'll be the first one to speak after the call.

631
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:09,220
Call the roll, Mr. Clerk.

632
00:38:12,582 --> 00:38:13,423
It's not before us.

633
00:38:13,763 --> 00:38:14,424
Can you call the roll?

634
00:38:14,464 --> 00:38:17,247
A yes vote?

635
00:38:17,568 --> 00:38:18,809
There's a challenge to the chair.

636
00:38:19,189 --> 00:38:20,310
A challenge to the chair.

637
00:38:21,472 --> 00:38:22,793
A challenge of the chair.

638
00:38:24,075 --> 00:38:27,158
stops debate until we take that challenge and rule on it.

639
00:38:27,438 --> 00:38:28,619
We're taking the vote right now.

640
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:29,900
Clerk will call the roll.

641
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,622
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.

642
00:38:31,662 --> 00:38:32,643
You can't do that.

643
00:38:32,963 --> 00:38:33,683
You don't make up these rules.

644
00:38:33,703 --> 00:38:34,324
You challenged the rule.

645
00:38:34,604 --> 00:38:36,346
I challenged, you're challenging me.

646
00:38:36,406 --> 00:38:37,327
That's what you're doing.

647
00:38:37,407 --> 00:38:37,647
No, no.

648
00:38:37,687 --> 00:38:45,234
And I'm telling you on the section rule number four and under rule 20, section one, this paper was presented by Mr. Knight and the council discussed it.

649
00:38:46,138 --> 00:38:50,142
That's the proper, listen, under suspension, just call the vote, a yes vote.

650
00:38:50,443 --> 00:38:51,424
I'm gonna move, you know something?

651
00:38:51,444 --> 00:38:55,108
I won't let you speak, but.

652
00:38:55,849 --> 00:38:57,670
Thank you, thank you for letting me speak.

653
00:38:58,051 --> 00:39:07,821
Before the roll is called, Mr. President, we should not be governing this body, Mr. President, by people leaving their position.

654
00:39:09,117 --> 00:39:16,926
speaking to people outside of the chambers, and then coming back with options on votes that just took place.

655
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:19,789
Because that's exactly what happened, Mr. President.

656
00:39:20,089 --> 00:39:24,554
You left your seat to get some opinion outside of this chamber and come back.

657
00:39:24,594 --> 00:39:28,298
And you're deliberating not before this body,

658
00:39:28,618 --> 00:39:29,819
You're on your own, Mr. President.

659
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:30,579
You're absolutely right.

660
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:32,000
And that should not be taking place.

661
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:38,343
With all due respect, Mr. President, I know you're new to the presidency, but you should not be doing that, Mr. President.

662
00:39:38,363 --> 00:39:39,143
With all due respect.

663
00:39:39,163 --> 00:39:39,704
It hasn't happened.

664
00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:41,485
I'll call it as I see it, Mr. President.

665
00:39:41,705 --> 00:39:47,168
Counselor, can we take a vote on the ruling of the chair, and then are we going to debate the paper, or it's going to be up before us next week?

666
00:39:47,508 --> 00:39:49,689
It's easy as that, because the ruling is what we're talking about.

667
00:39:49,709 --> 00:39:53,771
Well, your ruling should have taken place at the podium rather than outside of the chamber.

668
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:54,311
Well, it wasn't.

669
00:39:54,331 --> 00:39:55,532
Because that's where it took place.

670
00:39:56,272 --> 00:39:56,972
Mr. President.

671
00:39:56,992 --> 00:40:00,674
Counselor, I don't know why you would... Well, I think we all know what took place, Mr. President.

672
00:40:00,694 --> 00:40:01,254
Let's take a vote.

673
00:40:01,334 --> 00:40:04,735
If we were under suspension of the rules... Can we just take a vote?

674
00:40:04,755 --> 00:40:08,716
Because we might... Oh, she had a comment.

675
00:40:09,076 --> 00:40:12,697
When you challenge the chair, you're supposed to take precedent over everything.

676
00:40:13,538 --> 00:40:14,438
Counselor, what are we going to do?

677
00:40:14,478 --> 00:40:16,859
Debate the whole issue and then take a ruling on your challenge?

678
00:40:16,879 --> 00:40:17,499
You can't do it.

679
00:40:17,899 --> 00:40:19,239
I think we should debate this.

680
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:20,660
I mean... Oh.

681
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:25,163
We suspend the rules every meeting.

682
00:40:25,183 --> 00:40:28,206
We sometimes take almost the whole agenda out of order.

683
00:40:28,627 --> 00:40:33,472
So are you trying to say that none of the council rules should be followed on any paper we take?

684
00:40:33,773 --> 00:40:34,373
out of suspension.

685
00:40:34,393 --> 00:40:45,438
Councillor, if you realize, um, if you realize lately, members of this council have been asking for a suspension of rule number 33, specifically to take agenda items out of order because of your exact point, you're an attorney.

686
00:40:45,458 --> 00:40:48,300
You should know that once you suspend the rules, it's all the rules.

687
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:50,821
You're suspending the rules for the item that's on the agenda.

688
00:40:50,841 --> 00:40:52,121
You're suspending the council rules.

689
00:40:52,162 --> 00:40:52,942
It's clear as day.

690
00:40:52,962 --> 00:40:54,302
It's clear as day.

691
00:40:54,322 --> 00:40:55,263
I don't think it's clear as day.

692
00:40:55,283 --> 00:40:57,704
Well, let's take a vote in the majority of members of the council.

693
00:40:57,764 --> 00:40:59,625
Mr. President.

694
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:04,163
Could you read Rule 20 again, so everyone understands it?

695
00:41:04,843 --> 00:41:07,265
Rule 20 is a very straightforward rule.

696
00:41:08,026 --> 00:41:10,208
Councilor Pender read it, I will read it again.

697
00:41:10,828 --> 00:41:19,035
But as I stated, if all the rules are suspended, that includes number 20, number 33, and everything else in between.

698
00:41:19,976 --> 00:41:21,877
So Rule 20, would you like me to read it from the top?

699
00:41:22,778 --> 00:41:28,383
Well, I mean, if I understand it correctly, the tables have been weak.

700
00:41:28,991 --> 00:41:32,239
It certainly does, but if all the rules are suspended, then all the rules are up.

701
00:41:32,259 --> 00:41:35,227
Look, if we want to table it for a week, I have no problem doing that.

702
00:41:37,151 --> 00:41:37,811
We just did it.

703
00:41:38,571 --> 00:41:39,172
I understand that.

704
00:41:39,392 --> 00:41:43,334
Listen, you'd be the first one to jump down my throat if I made a mistake.

705
00:41:43,514 --> 00:41:47,016
I'm acknowledging that I made a mistake, and now you're still jumping down my throat.

706
00:41:47,057 --> 00:41:48,257
Who told you you made a mistake?

707
00:41:49,278 --> 00:41:50,499
Who told you?

708
00:41:51,059 --> 00:41:58,884
Because when I came back in and I noticed that Tom Lincoln's paper was being talked about, and I noticed that's at the end of the agenda, I said, we're still in the suspension of the rules.

709
00:41:59,304 --> 00:42:00,805
So that's the bottom line.

710
00:42:01,445 --> 00:42:02,566
So we're going to take a vote.

711
00:42:02,586 --> 00:42:04,908
That came up as a separate paper on the suspension.

712
00:42:05,208 --> 00:42:06,509
We're going to be here all night discussing.

713
00:42:06,529 --> 00:42:07,129
This is a circus.

714
00:42:07,249 --> 00:42:08,210
I know this is a circus.

715
00:42:09,531 --> 00:42:10,172
Mr. President.

716
00:42:10,192 --> 00:42:10,972
You challenge the chair.

717
00:42:11,172 --> 00:42:11,853
Let me tell you something.

718
00:42:11,873 --> 00:42:12,634
Let me just say this too.

719
00:42:13,134 --> 00:42:16,997
I don't know what any of the seven of us or any of the four who didn't vote for this,

720
00:42:17,447 --> 00:42:19,387
would be afraid to discuss these matters one at a time.

721
00:42:19,407 --> 00:42:20,508
Councilor, that's a different point right now.

722
00:42:20,528 --> 00:42:20,788
No, it isn't.

723
00:42:20,868 --> 00:42:21,668
That's the whole issue.

724
00:42:21,688 --> 00:42:25,169
You don't want to discuss it, because Councilor DelaRusso brought that up in the beginning.

725
00:42:25,189 --> 00:42:26,629
He just wanted to move to approve the paper.

726
00:42:26,929 --> 00:42:27,949
That's how this all started.

727
00:42:28,589 --> 00:42:35,271
Now, you have the budget director here, who's ready, willing, and able to answer any question that's going to be presented as to what took place in the Committee of the Law.

728
00:42:35,291 --> 00:42:36,991
What is everybody afraid of to talk about?

729
00:42:37,011 --> 00:42:38,292
Councilor, nobody said you could ask that.

730
00:42:38,312 --> 00:42:38,712
Well, then that's it.

731
00:42:38,732 --> 00:42:39,272
Then let it go.

732
00:42:39,312 --> 00:42:40,612
Just let us have our discussion.

733
00:42:40,632 --> 00:42:41,032
Of course.

734
00:42:41,472 --> 00:42:41,812
Then that's it.

735
00:42:41,832 --> 00:42:43,513
You can ask any question on the whole paper.

736
00:42:44,653 --> 00:42:45,334
The whole paper.

737
00:42:45,554 --> 00:42:47,055
Then let her come up and answer these questions.

738
00:42:47,195 --> 00:42:47,775
Absolutely.

739
00:42:48,035 --> 00:42:49,416
So let's take a vote on the chair first.

740
00:42:49,716 --> 00:42:50,617
Chair for what?

741
00:42:51,017 --> 00:42:52,959
Do you withdraw your challenge to the chair?

742
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:53,399
No.

743
00:42:53,699 --> 00:42:55,700
Then we have to take a vote on that before we proceed.

744
00:42:57,582 --> 00:42:58,082
It's a ruling.

745
00:42:58,582 --> 00:43:00,644
So we're going to take a vote on the challenge of the chair.

746
00:43:01,924 --> 00:43:05,587
The question before the council is if we were under suspension of all the rules,

747
00:43:07,214 --> 00:43:07,874
or we were not?

748
00:43:08,234 --> 00:43:08,374
No.

749
00:43:09,075 --> 00:43:12,435
Was the paper taken up when the city council was under suspension of the rules?

750
00:43:12,795 --> 00:43:13,876
And we're going to take that vote now.

751
00:43:13,956 --> 00:43:16,676
A yes vote says that we were not under suspending all the rules.

752
00:43:17,157 --> 00:43:19,737
A no vote will be that we were under suspension of the rules.

753
00:43:19,957 --> 00:43:21,278
And we'll move forward either way.

754
00:43:21,618 --> 00:43:26,039
No, Mr. President, you know, you've got to read 33 that you're alluding to.

755
00:43:26,799 --> 00:43:28,099
Okay.

756
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:33,761
Read it, read 33 if you want to have suspension of the rules and make this become operative.

757
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:38,982
It talks about a roll call, a salute to the flag, examination of the records of a previous meeting.

758
00:43:39,242 --> 00:43:55,268
It talks about hearings, presentations of petitions and similar papers, motions, orders, and resolutions, communications from the mayor, communications and reports from city office and employees, reports of committee, public participation papers in the committee, unfinished business and approval of records in previous meeting.

759
00:43:55,569 --> 00:43:57,649
You move suspension on one of these items.

760
00:43:57,949 --> 00:43:59,930
It's just that one particular paper.

761
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:01,271
You took it out of order.

762
00:44:02,451 --> 00:44:04,492
It doesn't negate the rules of the council.

763
00:44:04,552 --> 00:44:06,373
Councillor, we're going to take a vote.

764
00:44:06,593 --> 00:44:10,395
If Councillor that made the motion said we're under suspension of the rules, it's all the rules.

765
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:14,277
And if it was under rule 33 or any other rule, it would be that rule that was suspended.

766
00:44:14,537 --> 00:44:16,258
We're going to take a vote and we're going to move forward.

767
00:44:17,098 --> 00:44:18,278
and we'll do the people's business.

768
00:44:18,318 --> 00:44:22,459
So the vote is a yes vote is for the challenge of Councillor Penta.

769
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:27,220
A no vote is to acknowledge that we were under suspension of the rules and that all the rules were suspended.

770
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:27,920
And this is easy.

771
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:32,441
We can all watch the tape tomorrow and find out exactly what happened.

772
00:44:32,481 --> 00:44:33,282
We have a tape with us.

773
00:44:33,602 --> 00:44:35,082
It does not matter.

774
00:44:35,122 --> 00:44:36,642
Councillor Knight moved suspension of the rules.

775
00:44:36,702 --> 00:44:37,102
The rules.

776
00:44:37,323 --> 00:44:37,543
Correct?

777
00:44:37,563 --> 00:44:37,843
Correct.

778
00:44:38,003 --> 00:44:38,803
He moved suspension of the rules.

779
00:44:38,823 --> 00:44:41,723
He didn't move suspension of the rules for all the rules of the Council.

780
00:44:41,743 --> 00:44:43,764
The rules of the Council are the rules of the Council.

781
00:44:46,821 --> 00:44:48,850
as opposed to, I move for suspension of the rules.

782
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:51,624
In hindsight, looking at it now, I probably should have

783
00:44:51,907 --> 00:44:53,387
move for suspension of Rule 33.

784
00:44:53,447 --> 00:44:54,247
However, I didn't.

785
00:44:54,728 --> 00:45:00,449
So we can take a vote, whatever you guys want to do about a vote as to what was under suspension and what wasn't.

786
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:02,749
The motion that I put forward was a motion to suspend the rules.

787
00:45:02,769 --> 00:45:04,210
That's what I put forward.

788
00:45:04,450 --> 00:45:07,570
In hindsight, would I have liked to put a motion to suspend Rule Number 33?

789
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:08,370
Absolutely.

790
00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:09,031
Is that what I did?

791
00:45:09,091 --> 00:45:09,591
No, it is not.

792
00:45:09,991 --> 00:45:10,331
Exactly.

793
00:45:10,371 --> 00:45:12,271
And Councillor, I thank you for that.

794
00:45:12,391 --> 00:45:19,233
And I, as one member of the Council, I made a mistake, and I'm bringing the mistake back to the Council, which created this controversy.

795
00:45:19,253 --> 00:45:19,653
So we'll take a...

796
00:45:23,362 --> 00:45:23,583
Good.

797
00:45:24,284 --> 00:45:33,664
I'll be willing to withdraw my, and if council agrees to talk about these items, one at a time, I'm telling you, I'll be willing to withdraw that if the council acknowledges.

798
00:45:33,973 --> 00:45:35,534
discussing these matters one at a time.

799
00:45:35,795 --> 00:45:42,320
If you're willing to, listen, just so you know, the whole paper was before us, the whole paper, you asked for a vote on each individual item.

800
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:43,621
That's what we took a vote on.

801
00:45:44,141 --> 00:45:58,173
So the paper, if, if, if you withdraw your motion, the paper back before us, you can ask any questions out of the $1.638 million, any of them that we talked about at the committee of the whole, I just, at this point, we're wasting too much time.

802
00:45:58,213 --> 00:46:00,074
We're not getting any business done for the last 20 minutes.

803
00:46:00,134 --> 00:46:00,454
So I,

804
00:46:01,459 --> 00:46:02,180
Point of information.

805
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:03,801
There was a motion to sever that failed, correct?

806
00:46:04,141 --> 00:46:04,382
Yes.

807
00:46:04,482 --> 00:46:09,226
So now, if this item comes back onto the table, that motion is still in play.

808
00:46:09,286 --> 00:46:09,926
It's already failed.

809
00:46:10,007 --> 00:46:11,128
The motion to sever has already failed.

810
00:46:11,168 --> 00:46:18,714
So are we going to be able to get to our, you know, is the council going to be able to get to his end result at the end of the day, if he even does withdraw?

811
00:46:18,754 --> 00:46:21,116
I mean, are we still going to be able to go back now and undo that vote?

812
00:46:21,276 --> 00:46:26,981
What I would ask is someone that was on the prevailing side of that, I would ask that someone on the prevailing side of the severance, which would be myself,

813
00:46:27,959 --> 00:46:41,445
yourself and the two gentlemen over here, I would ask that one of them move reconsideration so that the whole paper can be back before us, all the questions can be asked to the budget director, and we can either vote yay or nay, and if that motion is presented again, we'll take another vote.

814
00:46:42,446 --> 00:46:45,127
So, on the challenge of the chair, or do you withdraw it, Councilor?

815
00:46:45,187 --> 00:46:45,747
What do you want to do?

816
00:46:46,288 --> 00:46:47,888
We have to move forward one way or the other.

817
00:46:48,249 --> 00:46:49,529
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

818
00:46:49,589 --> 00:46:56,933
Now what you're saying is if somebody on the prevailing side is willing to move reconsideration so we can discuss these items one at a time, then roll.

819
00:46:57,656 --> 00:46:59,417
to take a vote on them.

820
00:46:59,497 --> 00:47:01,957
I'm not taking that gamble because I can't trust this council.

821
00:47:01,997 --> 00:47:03,018
Well, that's your opinion.

822
00:47:03,038 --> 00:47:03,318
It is.

823
00:47:03,358 --> 00:47:03,778
All right.

824
00:47:03,858 --> 00:47:04,938
We're going to take a vote on the chair.

825
00:47:05,218 --> 00:47:06,959
There's a challenge to the chair by Councilor Penta.

826
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:09,940
A yes vote is for Councilor Penta.

827
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:19,002
A no vote is that we were under suspension of all the rules and tomorrow morning I'm going to be the first one at the clerk's office grabbing the tape because, because this is pretty straightforward.

828
00:47:20,043 --> 00:47:20,843
Clerk will call the roll.

829
00:47:21,243 --> 00:47:24,164
Yes for Councilor Penta, a no vote opposed the chair.

830
00:47:26,431 --> 00:47:27,472
Vice President Caviella?

831
00:47:27,692 --> 00:47:27,852
No.

832
00:47:29,673 --> 00:47:30,533
Councilor DelaRusso?

833
00:47:30,573 --> 00:47:30,753
No.

834
00:47:31,533 --> 00:47:32,134
Councilor Nye?

835
00:47:32,254 --> 00:47:32,394
No.

836
00:47:33,154 --> 00:47:33,975
Councilor Lohengrin?

837
00:47:34,015 --> 00:47:34,075
Yes.

838
00:47:35,055 --> 00:47:35,915
Councilor Marks?

839
00:47:36,236 --> 00:47:36,456
Yes.

840
00:47:37,196 --> 00:47:37,856
Councilor Penta?

841
00:47:38,076 --> 00:47:38,216
Yes.

842
00:47:38,837 --> 00:47:39,577
President Camuso?

843
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:40,097
No.

844
00:47:40,498 --> 00:47:49,762
By a vote of four noes, three negatives, we were under suspension of the rules, the challenge of the chair fails, and I apologize as the president for making a mistake.

845
00:47:50,670 --> 00:47:53,151
on the interpretation on rule we're under.

846
00:47:53,631 --> 00:47:57,632
And the paper, now by Councilor Dela Russo, is still before us.

847
00:47:57,792 --> 00:48:01,873
And the budget director's here to answer any questions you want, any councilors.

848
00:48:02,253 --> 00:48:03,093
Who would like to go first?

849
00:48:03,113 --> 00:48:05,314
I'd like to ask Councilor Dela Russo a question.

850
00:48:05,334 --> 00:48:08,955
Well, you can... I'd like to ask Councilor Dela Russo a question.

851
00:48:11,056 --> 00:48:11,776
Councilor Dela Russo.

852
00:48:14,116 --> 00:48:16,697
You're here to talk about... I want to talk about this paper.

853
00:48:17,197 --> 00:48:18,918
You said anybody can ask the budget director any...

854
00:48:19,888 --> 00:48:23,009
Councilor DelaRusso, first, a question before we go forward.

855
00:48:23,689 --> 00:48:27,430
Since you moved, Councilor DelaRusso, to vote for this paper, would you be good?

856
00:48:27,450 --> 00:48:28,990
No, we're not going to, Councilor.

857
00:48:29,191 --> 00:48:31,991
I'm asking Councilor DelaRusso, and you're speaking from the chair.

858
00:48:32,331 --> 00:48:34,112
The questions have to be addressed through the chair.

859
00:48:34,672 --> 00:48:35,692
You've been around a long time.

860
00:48:35,712 --> 00:48:36,613
You understand the process more than I do.

861
00:48:36,633 --> 00:48:36,973
Yeah, you're right.

862
00:48:36,993 --> 00:48:38,473
I'm asking my colleague a question.

863
00:48:38,853 --> 00:48:39,953
Do you want to entertain this question?

864
00:48:41,374 --> 00:48:42,714
Let's hear the question, Mr. Chair.

865
00:48:42,734 --> 00:48:49,296
Very simply, Councilor DelaRusso, you moved approval on a paper without having an opportunity be given to discuss each and every one of these items.

866
00:48:49,868 --> 00:48:52,310
Would you be willing to withdraw that so we could discuss these items?

867
00:48:52,930 --> 00:49:15,247
I think the reason why I presented, uh, the approval was first, I had attended the meeting, uh, that, uh, the committee of the whole meeting, Mr. Chairman, that you presided over with mayor, the budget director and various department heads were able to be present and, uh, entertain any questions that we may or may not have had.

868
00:49:15,945 --> 00:49:25,767
And having received a sufficient explanation of the items present before us, Mr. President, I was satisfied at that meeting.

869
00:49:25,847 --> 00:49:27,127
My questions were answered.

870
00:49:27,607 --> 00:49:31,248
I personally would have loved to have seen expenditures of money at Car Park.

871
00:49:31,728 --> 00:49:34,248
I had an intervention on that matter.

872
00:49:34,948 --> 00:49:37,429
It was an answer to my satisfaction.

873
00:49:37,929 --> 00:49:40,069
However, this is all good.

874
00:49:40,089 --> 00:49:41,789
These are improvements for the community.

875
00:49:42,289 --> 00:49:44,590
And I'm in favor of improving the community.

876
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:45,410
That's why I'm here.

877
00:49:46,067 --> 00:49:49,230
And so I think it's a good measure, and it has my support.

878
00:49:49,751 --> 00:49:54,496
Why would you not want to let your colleagues have an opportunity to ask further questions to Mrs. Burke?

879
00:49:55,857 --> 00:49:59,240
Mr. President, there were plenty of opportunities, and it had begun.

880
00:49:59,941 --> 00:50:02,944
Councilor Penta, you've got the floor.

881
00:50:03,164 --> 00:50:06,407
Can you ask any pertinent questions to the budget director on this paper, please?

882
00:50:06,447 --> 00:50:06,708
Yes.

883
00:50:08,970 --> 00:50:09,631
Stephanie, please.

884
00:50:14,348 --> 00:50:20,071
Let's go to the issue of the three retaining walls, Governor's Ave, Morgan, and Gaston.

885
00:50:20,691 --> 00:50:25,234
Now, Governor's Ave was done back in the early 2000s.

886
00:50:25,874 --> 00:50:27,675
What part of Governor's Ave in particular?

887
00:50:27,715 --> 00:50:30,637
Because residents have called, and they want to know what's going on.

888
00:50:30,657 --> 00:50:36,980
If you were looking at the part that we corrected years ago, it's farther up towards South Quarter.

889
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:38,801
Going toward Lawrence Road?

890
00:50:39,021 --> 00:50:39,221
Yes.

891
00:50:39,701 --> 00:50:40,001
OK.

892
00:50:40,141 --> 00:50:41,062
Closer to the hospital.

893
00:50:41,812 --> 00:50:44,634
And when you write Gaston, what's that, Gaston Street?

894
00:50:45,654 --> 00:50:45,875
Yes.

895
00:50:46,795 --> 00:50:47,996
What wall in Gaston Street?

896
00:50:48,036 --> 00:50:48,376
What end?

897
00:50:48,916 --> 00:50:49,817
Up in North Medford.

898
00:50:52,499 --> 00:50:52,779
OK.

899
00:50:54,320 --> 00:51:00,964
And these prices of $250,000, do these come from, I won't use, well, not legitimate.

900
00:51:00,984 --> 00:51:02,425
Estimates from outside engineers.

901
00:51:02,465 --> 00:51:03,705
You have, yeah, OK.

902
00:51:03,765 --> 00:51:05,126
These aren't city estimates.

903
00:51:05,166 --> 00:51:06,807
These are from definite contractors.

904
00:51:06,927 --> 00:51:08,088
They're not from contractors.

905
00:51:08,128 --> 00:51:09,369
They were from an outside engineer.

906
00:51:09,989 --> 00:51:11,050
Outside engineer, OK.

907
00:51:13,725 --> 00:51:18,869
The next question is, you corrected the stumps to $300,000, and the bucket truck for $65,000.

908
00:51:19,589 --> 00:51:27,695
Again, the bucket truck for $65,000, and then we have the trucks that come under linkage.

909
00:51:28,556 --> 00:51:30,978
Is there any reason why it just all didn't stay out of one account?

910
00:51:31,895 --> 00:51:33,956
Oh, well, linkage is for certain purposes.

911
00:51:34,517 --> 00:51:42,261
Um, the bucket truck is for our forestry division that really doesn't fall under any of the specific linkage, um, areas that are like citywide linkage accounts.

912
00:51:43,022 --> 00:51:45,423
So that's why it is before you in this manner.

913
00:51:45,443 --> 00:51:46,224
I'm trying to give them so much.

914
00:51:46,504 --> 00:51:46,784
All right.

915
00:51:47,625 --> 00:52:01,553
Next one is, um, the tennis courts at victory and the basketball, um, horizon, the basketball play stood tennis courts, Morris and the tennis courts, basketball courts at, um, at Duggar tennis courts at Duggar Harris.

916
00:52:02,804 --> 00:52:09,272
A lot of these parks through the years, as you know, and even when you were on the council, have seen upgradings through the years.

917
00:52:09,852 --> 00:52:13,436
Some of these parks are in their third iteration of being upgraded.

918
00:52:13,516 --> 00:52:17,281
And I just want to hold that aside as, as Ms.

919
00:52:17,321 --> 00:52:20,024
Mott indicated a little bit back there.

920
00:52:20,905 --> 00:52:22,987
The city hall fire alarm system, the upgrade to that,

921
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:29,322
If I remember correctly, actually, if I could interject that city buildings, it's really not just city hall, it's city buildings.

922
00:52:30,003 --> 00:52:35,645
So we had a fire alarm company come through all of the city owned buildings and they said, this needs to be replaced.

923
00:52:35,745 --> 00:52:37,066
This needs to be replaced.

924
00:52:37,346 --> 00:52:38,726
You have to repair this part.

925
00:52:39,026 --> 00:52:46,009
So when they comprehensively put them all together to Mr. Hurley, the superintendent of wires, this was the estimate that they provided.

926
00:52:46,289 --> 00:52:47,990
So these are all citywide buildings.

927
00:52:48,170 --> 00:52:50,211
When you say city, we, including the school department or not?

928
00:52:50,251 --> 00:52:52,172
No, no, no, no, no library.

929
00:52:52,312 --> 00:52:52,592
Okay.

930
00:52:54,016 --> 00:52:57,218
The pads for the fire alarm installation citywide.

931
00:52:57,398 --> 00:53:15,088
As the mayor explained, the council appropriated funds and wanted for us to use the solar battery communication system for our new fire alarm boxes throughout the city with the intent that our DPW department would actually be pouring the pads that you bolt the fire alarms into.

932
00:53:16,048 --> 00:53:19,311
their workload has just been so immense that they weren't able to get to it.

933
00:53:19,331 --> 00:53:31,319
So we do want to get these pads poured ASAP so that we can get these alarms hooked up and be done with all the city properties so we can get off that old system, the Christmas tree light system that we currently have.

934
00:53:31,879 --> 00:53:37,383
On the LED conversion, I believe, even though Medford Square is on there, I believe all the squares

935
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:39,816
were supposed to be taken into consideration.

936
00:53:39,836 --> 00:53:44,697
We paid a few thousand dollars, was it a couple of years ago, last year to change all the lenses.

937
00:54:02,599 --> 00:54:03,882
We did, and that's already been done.

938
00:54:03,922 --> 00:54:05,105
Those were just like the glass.

939
00:54:05,566 --> 00:54:07,150
That's actually where the light emits from.

940
00:54:07,390 --> 00:54:08,593
The animal van, OK.

941
00:54:09,255 --> 00:54:10,758
Historical matching grant, current $15,000.

942
00:54:12,112 --> 00:54:12,712
and pending is 20.

943
00:54:12,812 --> 00:54:13,952
What is the one that's pending?

944
00:54:13,972 --> 00:54:20,594
Historical Society has just received notice that they had applied for a grant for this year, which is the first one, the 15.

945
00:54:20,954 --> 00:54:27,476
That's the match that the city would have to put up, and that is to finish off Medford Square, all the historical sites.

946
00:54:28,076 --> 00:54:36,558
The one they are applying for at present is the $20,000, and that is for Magoon area.

947
00:54:38,478 --> 00:54:39,218
The Glenwood area.

948
00:54:39,778 --> 00:54:41,439
Glenwood, okay.

949
00:54:43,612 --> 00:54:45,533
Point of information, Councilor Del Rosso.

950
00:54:45,873 --> 00:54:53,837
Can it be also noted that at the Committee of the Whole meeting that several councilors took the opportunity to attend for this discussion.

951
00:54:54,318 --> 00:55:06,584
The question was asked by myself for an update regarding the lack of lighting in the parking lot on Mr. Delatatwe, often referred to as behind St.

952
00:55:06,644 --> 00:55:07,104
Joseph's.

953
00:55:07,885 --> 00:55:11,687
I asked that and was told that the matter was put towards

954
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:14,825
the Department of Conservation and Recreation.

955
00:55:16,386 --> 00:55:16,687
Thank you.

956
00:55:16,707 --> 00:55:19,409
That's a very important issue that's been before this council.

957
00:55:20,029 --> 00:55:23,132
I think Mr. President, I brought that up 13 times, if not 14.

958
00:55:23,552 --> 00:55:23,753
I know.

959
00:55:23,773 --> 00:55:24,493
City Hall computer refresh.

960
00:55:28,793 --> 00:55:34,156
Those are the actual computers that are at all the stations for all the employees in this building.

961
00:55:34,276 --> 00:55:40,199
And as you know, Windows just underwent, basically, they're not supporting some of the older computers any longer.

962
00:55:40,299 --> 00:55:45,422
So we want to switch them out, get us all on the same platform with the same software, et cetera.

963
00:55:45,442 --> 00:55:48,424
So that's what the goal is with that line item.

964
00:55:49,104 --> 00:55:51,786
On the issue regarding bicycle lanes, where are they going to be?

965
00:55:53,128 --> 00:55:56,471
We have a member of the bicycle commission that's present here.

966
00:55:56,892 --> 00:55:59,254
The mayor spoke earlier this evening in the committee.

967
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:07,682
They have proposed a few different locations that added bike riders and that use their bike as their mode of transportation.

968
00:56:08,762 --> 00:56:14,003
Placestead Road, I believe, is one of the major, the primary area that they want to attack.

969
00:56:14,783 --> 00:56:19,184
Parts of Winthrop Street, Placestead Road, and Boston Ave.

970
00:56:19,224 --> 00:56:26,886
Those are the three main ones that they want to get the markings on so that people that do use bicycles for transportation are safer.

971
00:56:31,327 --> 00:56:32,867
Name and address for the record, please.

972
00:56:32,887 --> 00:56:34,347
Bruce Kulik, Grove Street.

973
00:56:34,787 --> 00:56:37,348
I am the chairman of the Medford Bicycle Advisory Commission.

974
00:56:38,345 --> 00:56:50,168
One of the additional areas that I believe was on the docket was the stretch from Magoon Square into Medford, which has just been recently repaved and either recently re-striped or about to be re-striped.

975
00:56:51,629 --> 00:56:54,450
If I may, while we have Bruce, a point of, can I ask?

976
00:56:54,530 --> 00:56:55,570
You want to say, Councilwoman?

977
00:56:55,950 --> 00:56:56,070
No.

978
00:56:56,090 --> 00:57:06,093
Just to, on this bicycle lane issue, it was asked in the committee meeting, Mr. Kulik, with regards to these four or five streets that are going to be done at the beginning.

979
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:14,567
They're not going to consume the full $25,000, so is the bicycle commission involved at all of what streets would be, you know.

980
00:57:15,399 --> 00:57:19,541
you would want done next in Medford and so on and so forth so that we are just on top of it.

981
00:57:19,601 --> 00:57:31,226
Yes, we're developing a master plan that involves basically a staged approach starting very conservatively to begin with until people become accustomed to them and working our way towards additional streets.

982
00:57:31,907 --> 00:57:38,490
Also in conjunction with the mayor as far as, you know, what he believes to be the best applications.

983
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:43,152
And any idea on, I mean, has the bicycle commission done any,

984
00:57:44,596 --> 00:57:50,699
research on what it costs to actually pay for one of these, one street at a time.

985
00:57:50,719 --> 00:57:58,844
Right now, we've worked with the DPW, gotten some estimates from them, and we have a sense of how much per mile, per bike lane things cost, but I don't recall what those numbers are.

986
00:58:00,204 --> 00:58:02,366
Anyway, you could forward that to the council?

987
00:58:03,226 --> 00:58:03,606
Yeah, for sure.

988
00:58:04,307 --> 00:58:04,507
Thanks.

989
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:08,509
And who will, will this, this will be going out to bid, Director Burke?

990
00:58:09,409 --> 00:58:09,710
Thank you.

991
00:58:10,970 --> 00:58:11,851
Councilor Penta has it.

992
00:58:12,342 --> 00:58:19,398
Also, on the $25,000, can you just explain to the people what actually these lanes are going to do?

993
00:58:19,478 --> 00:58:22,966
I mean, how are they going to interact with people on the street with cars?

994
00:58:24,837 --> 00:58:33,524
There are basically two types of pavement markings that can be applied depending upon the width of the street, traffic considerations, and so forth.

995
00:58:34,885 --> 00:58:49,537
The first and one of the most common is referred to as a SHARO, which is basically just a reminder regarding state law which permits bicycle operation within a full lane at any time at the discretion of the bicycle operator.

996
00:58:50,197 --> 00:58:58,580
So those chero is basically look like a bicycle symbol with a couple hats on top of the large chevrons is what they're actually called.

997
00:58:59,341 --> 00:59:06,864
And you can see them in some of the neighboring communities, particularly on College Avenue is one of the closest ones within Somerville near Tufts.

998
00:59:07,684 --> 00:59:33,689
The other pavement markings are actual bike lanes, which are generally five feet wide, and depending upon whether parking is permitted on the street and how wide the street itself is, might be outside the parking lane, or rather, it might be between the parking lane and the traffic lane, or might be all the way against the curb, again, depending upon whether parking is permitted.

999
00:59:34,832 --> 00:59:40,316
In the case of Winthrop Street, we will be looking at exactly where those go.

1000
00:59:40,377 --> 00:59:48,062
I don't recall whether parking is permitted on that stretch of Winthrop Street or not, or whether parking is generally used in that area.

1001
00:59:48,583 --> 00:59:55,868
On Playstead Road, certainly parking is permitted, so likely the bicycle lanes will be between the parking lane and the general traffic lane.

1002
00:59:56,369 --> 00:59:58,230
You're not entertaining Winthrop Street.

1003
00:59:58,817 --> 01:00:01,040
from Boston Avenue down to the bottom of the hill?

1004
01:00:01,060 --> 01:00:08,870
No, we're referring to the stretch between the Winchester town line and approximately Wildwood Street, which is near the high school.

1005
01:00:09,852 --> 01:00:10,132
OK.

1006
01:00:10,533 --> 01:00:12,035
Now, you used the word five feet wide.

1007
01:00:12,095 --> 01:00:12,816
Is that the minimum?

1008
01:00:13,597 --> 01:00:15,980
It has to be at a minimum for bike lane, five feet?

1009
01:00:16,552 --> 01:00:26,616
The absolute minimum is four feet wide, and that is only to be used in places where it's permissible, depending upon the width of the lane.

1010
01:00:26,776 --> 01:00:31,978
We've recently gotten some standards that are being used by the town of Arlington

1011
01:00:32,578 --> 01:00:43,726
regarding decisions as to where bicycle lanes, how wide, whether share or should go in or whether there should be no markings at all, depending upon traffic volumes and width of the street.

1012
01:00:44,507 --> 01:00:47,389
And that was really well put together for them.

1013
01:00:47,489 --> 01:00:59,278
And we hope to adopt that at our next general meeting, which will be December the 3rd, so that we can have some guidance as to what other towns have done, where lanes have been put in.

1014
01:01:00,630 --> 01:01:04,432
But generally, five feet, to answer your question, five feet is the preferred minimum.

1015
01:01:05,412 --> 01:01:07,313
And one last point on this issue.

1016
01:01:08,333 --> 01:01:09,394
Who's going to make the signs?

1017
01:01:09,534 --> 01:01:10,534
Who's paying for the signs?

1018
01:01:11,195 --> 01:01:11,755
Is this part of the $25,000?

1019
01:01:11,815 --> 01:01:13,876
What was the question?

1020
01:01:14,096 --> 01:01:14,436
Signs.

1021
01:01:14,756 --> 01:01:15,136
The signs.

1022
01:01:15,176 --> 01:01:15,657
Bicycle signs.

1023
01:01:15,677 --> 01:01:19,478
I believe that's part of the $25,000, and I don't know whether they're manufactured locally or purchased.

1024
01:01:21,799 --> 01:01:21,899
OK.

1025
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:24,961
If we can go on, Mr. Thank you.

1026
01:01:25,501 --> 01:01:27,922
If we can go on further, where you have public arts and funds

1027
01:01:28,965 --> 01:01:31,346
uh, for student project of $25,000.

1028
01:01:31,386 --> 01:01:35,968
Um, is this for the citywide public school system?

1029
01:01:36,188 --> 01:01:37,309
Just the high school or what?

1030
01:01:40,450 --> 01:01:42,631
Could we get a report back from the superintendent on this one?

1031
01:01:43,232 --> 01:01:44,272
All right, please.

1032
01:01:45,373 --> 01:01:46,713
Can you move that Mr. Clark to get that?

1033
01:01:48,014 --> 01:01:55,117
I report from the superintendent on the public arts funds, the 25,000, how it can be expended and how do you become eligible for it?

1034
01:01:56,807 --> 01:01:59,549
Now, we have to talk about security cameras at $10,000.

1035
01:01:59,929 --> 01:02:04,692
I believe it was Counselor Lungo-Curran who brought this issue up a while back with the Chief of Police.

1036
01:02:05,413 --> 01:02:10,036
And I don't know what we're buying for $10,000, but why are we only picking Commercial Street?

1037
01:02:10,376 --> 01:02:11,536
And how much are these cameras going for?

1038
01:02:11,557 --> 01:02:13,077
Actually, it's Commercial Street, et cetera.

1039
01:02:13,198 --> 01:02:13,678
What's that mean?

1040
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:21,349
Councilmember Kern actually suggested trying to get a portable camera that we could place in different locations, and we're certainly going to look into that.

1041
01:02:22,110 --> 01:02:30,941
But the estimates that I received were about $2,500 each for a stationary one, and that would be four different locations.

1042
01:02:31,121 --> 01:02:32,282
But it's all subject to

1043
01:02:34,132 --> 01:02:41,016
The next item plans for the police department headquarters a renovation that's 17,000 and that's left over from there was it

1044
01:02:59,284 --> 01:03:01,024
$80,000 of the police and fire head.

1045
01:03:01,044 --> 01:03:16,213
There's 63,000 remaining and we estimate about 80,000 for an architect to come up with the plans that would actually go out to fit once the electrical division is moved into the DBW yard and the repair bays are being done at the DBW yard.

1046
01:03:16,273 --> 01:03:25,858
So we're hoping April 1st would be when the DBW is scheduled to open and shortly thereafter we would be able to reuse the space that is being exited.

1047
01:03:27,235 --> 01:03:37,662
next issue on speed bumps, which are movable, I believe this was Councillor Maxwell's issue for a long period of time, and movable, I'm getting the opinion that means it's convertible?

1048
01:03:37,702 --> 01:03:40,184
And before when that was brought up?

1049
01:03:40,858 --> 01:03:42,219
We were told, no, they can't do that.

1050
01:03:42,619 --> 01:03:43,360
Now they can do it?

1051
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:47,624
Well, the mayor spoke earlier, and the people want them.

1052
01:03:47,744 --> 01:03:49,405
So he is looking into options.

1053
01:03:49,945 --> 01:03:56,170
What is really neat about this product, I don't know if Councilor Marks subscribes to Traffic Logic.

1054
01:03:56,251 --> 01:03:58,052
I don't know if you get their regular.

1055
01:03:58,713 --> 01:04:03,717
It's a really neat publication that comes out probably monthly with all kinds of traffic calming ideas.

1056
01:04:04,658 --> 01:04:18,175
And that's where I first saw this this item and it's they call them humps because they're They're wide enough that a vehicle can't cast to go over it But a fire apparatus or a large truck can actually go around it.

1057
01:04:18,556 --> 01:04:19,136
So that's that's

1058
01:04:19,857 --> 01:04:24,020
why there are traffic humps as opposed to bumps and speed bumps and things like that.

1059
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:26,982
But they have a litany of different options that we can utilize.

1060
01:04:27,022 --> 01:04:28,843
And of course, the police chief will be involved.

1061
01:04:29,404 --> 01:04:31,105
But these are bolted down.

1062
01:04:31,185 --> 01:04:35,448
So your own DPW department can actually, once you purchase it, it comes with everything needed.

1063
01:04:35,748 --> 01:04:41,752
You can bolt it down, do a test run, see if it really works in the area or that particular location on the street.

1064
01:04:41,792 --> 01:04:42,973
Maybe it's in the wrong spot.

1065
01:04:43,654 --> 01:04:47,857
And then you can better gauge whether or not a permanent structure is needed.

1066
01:04:48,677 --> 01:04:55,540
And if and when that determination is made and you go with a permanent structure, these can be moved somewhere else to be, to do more test cases.

1067
01:04:56,380 --> 01:05:01,842
There was three locations, I believe, once again, when Councilor Marks had brought this up and Morrison Park.

1068
01:05:01,922 --> 01:05:08,985
And that's the, if you see the dimensions, the 28 and the 32, those are the actual street widths of those two locations.

1069
01:05:09,565 --> 01:05:14,467
And the estimates were based off of those, um, those dimensions for the temporary.

1070
01:05:15,487 --> 01:05:17,208
Next one is you have cruises here for 40,000.

1071
01:05:18,747 --> 01:05:23,329
That, again, would be a four payment lease term for four vehicles.

1072
01:05:24,329 --> 01:05:31,432
Four payment lease for four vehicles, right?

1073
01:05:31,992 --> 01:05:32,333
Correct.

1074
01:05:34,353 --> 01:05:38,115
And then we have the new plaques for the Veterans Memorial at $30,000.

1075
01:05:38,555 --> 01:05:47,839
Now, I know the mayor had mentioned at the Veterans Day at the VFW about adding on to Memorial

1076
01:05:50,628 --> 01:05:52,308
Is this a new name, Veterans Memorial Park?

1077
01:05:52,408 --> 01:05:53,049
I mean, I don't know.

1078
01:05:53,289 --> 01:05:54,489
Is this the one by the high school?

1079
01:05:54,670 --> 01:05:55,630
By the high school, correct.

1080
01:05:56,030 --> 01:06:01,253
It's names that were inadvertently left off of the plaques that are up there now.

1081
01:06:02,053 --> 01:06:07,796
There's currently about 23 names of individuals that should have been on one of the plaques and are not.

1082
01:06:08,876 --> 01:06:16,700
So this would get a plaque done depending on the walks, because obviously in the middle where, you know, the center of the park,

1083
01:06:18,207 --> 01:06:23,148
If it was a World War II veteran that was left off, it would go on that wall, that base of the wall.

1084
01:06:23,448 --> 01:06:28,449
And if it was a different wall, like Rocky Freedom, it would be on a different base.

1085
01:06:28,689 --> 01:06:30,790
So these names are running about $1,200 a piece?

1086
01:06:31,450 --> 01:06:46,173
This is actual, the brass plaque itself is probably the most expensive part, and that is, it's getting it large enough that it can accommodate additional names, and then the mayor's plan at some point, when and if we know we have every name, would be to melt down a plaque

1087
01:06:48,522 --> 01:06:49,682
one alphabetical one.

1088
01:06:50,583 --> 01:06:52,063
But that's into the future.

1089
01:06:52,223 --> 01:06:53,964
Point of clarification on that, though.

1090
01:06:55,064 --> 01:07:00,286
The mayor mentioned that this money is for now and in the future.

1091
01:07:00,766 --> 01:07:04,628
So money will be put aside to melt these plaques down and redo them.

1092
01:07:04,648 --> 01:07:08,849
There are members in the armed services in these particular laws that are still out there.

1093
01:07:08,949 --> 01:07:10,950
And when they come back, they would be added.

1094
01:07:12,931 --> 01:07:16,172
Mr. President, looking at all these issues,

1095
01:07:17,452 --> 01:07:18,052
they sound good.

1096
01:07:18,112 --> 01:07:22,215
My, my concerns would be the parks, knowing that the parks have been done numerous times over and over and over.

1097
01:07:22,895 --> 01:07:23,835
I'll just speak for myself.

1098
01:07:24,736 --> 01:07:33,180
I was never asked about any one of these items and I was never asked by the city administration as to, is there something that I would like to have in there?

1099
01:07:34,021 --> 01:07:39,164
You can't use the argument about the LED lights in Memphis square cause that's just nothing more than a public safety issue.

1100
01:07:39,844 --> 01:07:43,286
And as councilor DelaRusso alluded to, it's public safety for the St.

1101
01:07:43,306 --> 01:07:45,027
Joseph parking lot on route 16.

1102
01:07:46,575 --> 01:07:52,439
Tonight it was just announced by the Wynn Casino people that they're giving the city of Medford $250,000.

1103
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:54,541
Tonight, okay?

1104
01:07:54,981 --> 01:07:56,382
I believe it was on the 5 o'clock news.

1105
01:07:57,643 --> 01:08:02,547
Giving it to Medford, they're giving it to Everett, they're giving it, and I believe it's Malden.

1106
01:08:03,328 --> 01:08:10,273
So that's another $250,000 that now comes into the mix as it relates to what is the city gonna do with it.

1107
01:08:10,914 --> 01:08:14,136
I don't see anything in this piece of paper, this document,

1108
01:08:14,682 --> 01:08:17,384
It talks about streets, or sidewalks, or potholes.

1109
01:08:17,544 --> 01:08:17,784
Yes.

1110
01:08:17,944 --> 01:08:19,285
It does stumps and sidewalks.

1111
01:08:19,305 --> 01:08:20,125
No, that's stumps.

1112
01:08:20,185 --> 01:08:21,086
I'm talking about potholes.

1113
01:08:21,106 --> 01:08:22,006
Stumps and sidewalks.

1114
01:08:22,166 --> 01:08:23,587
Yeah, I'm talking about potholes.

1115
01:08:23,627 --> 01:08:24,128
Potholes.

1116
01:08:24,228 --> 01:08:24,508
Oh, OK.

1117
01:08:24,648 --> 01:08:26,189
Potholes are still being, if I could?

1118
01:08:26,409 --> 01:08:26,569
Yeah.

1119
01:08:26,829 --> 01:08:34,153
The potholes are still being attacked from some of the pothole money that we had with the Chapter 90, that special funding that the state came up with.

1120
01:08:35,214 --> 01:08:40,677
And also, our Chapter 90 funds, which the engineering office is working on streets that need to be done.

1121
01:08:42,425 --> 01:08:44,246
It takes a lot of effort to get these things done.

1122
01:08:44,266 --> 01:08:48,770
And as you know, there's a lot of projects going on in the city that need to close up before you can start new ones.

1123
01:08:49,390 --> 01:08:51,372
And we are looking at, of course, we're looking.

1124
01:08:51,412 --> 01:09:00,338
I mean, that- Well, I don't see anything in here, to be honest with you, as it relates to the city going out through the Office of Community Development as it relates to the business district.

1125
01:09:00,518 --> 01:09:02,560
I don't see anything like that there at all.

1126
01:09:02,660 --> 01:09:04,901
That wouldn't fall under the CDBG program.

1127
01:09:05,022 --> 01:09:05,862
It might fall into that.

1128
01:09:05,902 --> 01:09:08,364
But if we're sitting on almost $7.5, $7.8 million in free cash,

1129
01:09:11,998 --> 01:09:14,319
something needs to be said, I think, as far as that part goes.

1130
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:27,125
Also, when we talk about signs, and I think it was our chief that was seen on Channel 7 last week as he relates to signage in the city of Medford and his remarks, we don't have enough money.

1131
01:09:27,145 --> 01:09:28,646
We don't have any money to do the signage.

1132
01:09:29,386 --> 01:09:36,789
And I don't understand we don't have enough money to do the signage when we have almost $7.8 million in free cash.

1133
01:09:37,370 --> 01:09:40,491
And then when I look at the fact that under the linkage program,

1134
01:09:41,513 --> 01:09:43,014
you're requesting, I think it's $8,000?

1135
01:09:43,194 --> 01:09:43,014
$10,000?

1136
01:09:43,214 --> 01:09:48,217
What is the linkage?

1137
01:09:48,237 --> 01:09:48,217
$8,000.

1138
01:09:48,257 --> 01:09:49,237
$8,000 to do signs.

1139
01:09:50,758 --> 01:09:57,062
And it's my understanding, if I'm reading the contract correctly, from Tennessee, what's the name of the place?

1140
01:09:57,082 --> 01:09:58,702
Those aren't parking signs.

1141
01:09:58,802 --> 01:09:59,243
Pardon me?

1142
01:09:59,583 --> 01:10:01,964
Those signs for linkage have nothing to do with parking.

1143
01:10:02,004 --> 01:10:04,045
Those are actually street signs.

1144
01:10:04,365 --> 01:10:04,566
Right.

1145
01:10:05,006 --> 01:10:05,926
They're not parking signs.

1146
01:10:05,946 --> 01:10:06,447
They could be stop signs.

1147
01:10:06,467 --> 01:10:08,808
So you're talking about a street name sign?

1148
01:10:08,828 --> 01:10:09,508
Stop signs.

1149
01:10:09,968 --> 01:10:10,068
Oh.

1150
01:10:10,469 --> 01:10:10,769
We'll see.

1151
01:10:11,365 --> 01:10:13,486
I think that needs to be more specific.

1152
01:10:14,426 --> 01:10:40,053
And also, we were supposed to be getting a report back as a follow-up, because I've spoken to some of the business people as it relates to Republic going into some of these certain business folks, and there's still some concern over who was going to be gifted with the free 30-minute parking spaces, who was going to be gifted with the sign and the repair of the signs that they're supposed to be putting up, who was going to be exempt in the business districts from not having it.

1153
01:10:41,423 --> 01:10:47,367
Again, I think the council had asked for that type of information to be forthcoming, and we haven't seen or heard anything.

1154
01:10:47,567 --> 01:10:49,649
That plan is not finished yet.

1155
01:10:49,789 --> 01:10:55,913
I know on Friday, the Republic people and the chief of police did a walkthrough of their suggestions.

1156
01:10:56,694 --> 01:11:02,938
And from that, they were going to actually get it onto a map and show us where everything would be laid out.

1157
01:11:02,978 --> 01:11:07,181
So it was all subject to walking with the police chief to find out where it made sense.

1158
01:11:08,437 --> 01:11:10,317
So, that has not been finalized.

1159
01:11:10,357 --> 01:11:12,698
As soon as it does, we will get you a copy of that map.

1160
01:11:12,718 --> 01:11:28,601
Mr. President, I'd like to move that the $250,000 that was announced tonight by the Wynn Casino Group, that they may report back and respectfully ask of the council of what particular projects they might be interested in that this $250,000 could be used for.

1161
01:11:28,621 --> 01:11:34,042
Mr. President, I- Just if I can be clear, I've asked for some guidance from the city clerk.

1162
01:11:34,522 --> 01:11:37,103
The paper is back before us, so the sever,

1163
01:11:37,765 --> 01:11:39,326
And everything would have to be brought up again.

1164
01:11:39,426 --> 01:11:42,227
So this is the first motion with this paper.

1165
01:11:42,407 --> 01:11:42,647
OK?

1166
01:11:43,167 --> 01:11:43,287
Second.

1167
01:11:43,307 --> 01:11:44,348
This is the first motion.

1168
01:11:44,528 --> 01:11:44,748
Second.

1169
01:11:44,768 --> 01:11:45,428
I gave him another one.

1170
01:11:45,448 --> 01:11:45,908
Well, the second.

1171
01:11:45,928 --> 01:11:46,249
I'm sorry.

1172
01:11:46,269 --> 01:11:46,849
I apologize.

1173
01:11:47,129 --> 01:11:47,409
OK?

1174
01:11:48,069 --> 01:11:49,290
So before we get into it.

1175
01:11:50,193 --> 01:11:58,077
The motion is to ask the mayor what the council would like to see, some of the $250,000 that the city's getting from Wynn Management.

1176
01:11:58,177 --> 01:11:59,497
Mr. President.

1177
01:11:59,537 --> 01:12:00,158
No, it doesn't.

1178
01:12:00,478 --> 01:12:02,819
No, no, it'd be a B paper, whatever you want to call it.

1179
01:12:02,839 --> 01:12:11,303
Mr. President, if I could, I don't have the agreement in front of me, but I think if you, even if you go up to the gaming commission site, you can download the city of Medford's agreement with Wynn.

1180
01:12:11,623 --> 01:12:19,087
If I'm not mistaken, $200,000 is actually been earmarked for the Peace Garden from Wynn.

1181
01:12:20,585 --> 01:12:23,666
Well, we had asked before, since you've digressed over there.

1182
01:12:23,686 --> 01:12:24,827
Oh, I didn't digress.

1183
01:12:24,907 --> 01:12:25,167
No.

1184
01:12:25,267 --> 01:12:26,848
Oh, yeah, you're responding, right.

1185
01:12:27,228 --> 01:12:30,750
But the mayor indicated that he's had all kinds of money coming in fast and furious.

1186
01:12:31,050 --> 01:12:32,451
This is a million dollar peace garden.

1187
01:12:33,511 --> 01:12:35,132
And we haven't seen anything as a report.

1188
01:12:35,552 --> 01:12:37,993
Just itemize where the money's coming from.

1189
01:12:38,273 --> 01:12:39,114
It's coming from linkage.

1190
01:12:39,174 --> 01:12:40,735
It's coming from community block grant funding.

1191
01:12:40,975 --> 01:12:42,295
It's coming from city finances.

1192
01:12:42,355 --> 01:12:44,596
It's supposedly coming from private finances.

1193
01:12:44,917 --> 01:12:46,217
And now you're saying Wynn has given another $200,000.

1194
01:12:46,277 --> 01:12:48,018
We can give you the detail to allocate.

1195
01:12:48,038 --> 01:12:48,918
We'd like a report on that.

1196
01:12:49,119 --> 01:12:49,519
Yeah, OK.

1197
01:12:50,858 --> 01:12:51,618
Mr. Clerk, did you?

1198
01:12:52,119 --> 01:12:52,739
Yep, we got that.

1199
01:12:53,139 --> 01:12:56,061
What the $250,000 would, and what the council would like to see.

1200
01:12:56,121 --> 01:12:57,082
No, no, no.

1201
01:12:57,342 --> 01:12:59,163
Well, you got $50,000 left.

1202
01:12:59,183 --> 01:12:59,944
$50,000 was their original.

1203
01:12:59,964 --> 01:13:01,285
They've already paid us $50,000.

1204
01:13:01,405 --> 01:13:03,466
They already cut a check for $50,000 for the Peace Garden.

1205
01:13:03,566 --> 01:13:04,387
The Peace Garden.

1206
01:13:04,487 --> 01:13:07,749
90 days post their getting their license.

1207
01:13:07,769 --> 01:13:08,449
Which is January.

1208
01:13:08,469 --> 01:13:15,874
With another $200,000 is set to come in while the Peace Garden is in the surrounding community agreement, which is online for all to see.

1209
01:13:16,375 --> 01:13:17,295
And has been provided.

1210
01:13:17,315 --> 01:13:17,775
No, it's the whole $250,000.

1211
01:13:17,815 --> 01:13:18,856
Has the whole $250,000 been earmarked?

1212
01:13:20,649 --> 01:13:21,509
It was in two pieces.

1213
01:13:21,529 --> 01:13:23,310
50 was on licensing.

1214
01:13:23,330 --> 01:13:25,250
200 was 90 days later.

1215
01:13:25,770 --> 01:13:27,651
If I'm not mistaken, this is off the top of my head.

1216
01:13:27,671 --> 01:13:27,831
So.

1217
01:13:28,531 --> 01:13:29,591
So how are we going to, if it's already.

1218
01:13:29,831 --> 01:13:31,052
Well, I guess we, I guess we.

1219
01:13:31,912 --> 01:13:33,332
You want a breakdown of the full million?

1220
01:13:33,972 --> 01:13:34,212
Yes.

1221
01:13:34,292 --> 01:13:34,913
You want a breakdown.

1222
01:13:34,993 --> 01:13:37,733
I want a breakdown of the money, therefore brought in.

1223
01:13:38,033 --> 01:13:38,514
All funding.

1224
01:13:38,774 --> 01:13:39,194
All funding.

1225
01:13:39,554 --> 01:13:39,814
All right.

1226
01:13:40,134 --> 01:13:40,334
Okay.

1227
01:13:41,344 --> 01:13:49,786
All right, so we got two amendments, public arts and where the superintendent is gonna go with the rules slash regulations and who's eligible for the funding.

1228
01:13:50,146 --> 01:14:00,289
And then the second one is to get a breakdown of the wind money that is coming into the city of Medford based upon the recent agreements and the signing of the law that wind got their license, correct?

1229
01:14:00,309 --> 01:14:04,410
No, no, and the breakdown of the money, the funding thus far.

1230
01:14:04,850 --> 01:14:05,631
Correct, okay.

1231
01:14:05,811 --> 01:14:07,671
And the linear cost for the bike lanes.

1232
01:14:07,971 --> 01:14:08,171
Yes.

1233
01:14:08,831 --> 01:14:10,692
The bike lanes, was that a motion with the bike lanes?

1234
01:14:14,033 --> 01:14:16,036
Councillor Karygiannis.

1235
01:14:16,356 --> 01:14:17,839
You have the floor on the entire paper.

1236
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:25,752
Yes, the parks, Victory, Morris and Playstead, Duggar and Harris, how did we come up with these figures?

1237
01:14:25,792 --> 01:14:26,874
I know we discussed this in the

1238
01:14:27,407 --> 01:14:31,090
committee meeting, but not exactly how those figures came to.

1239
01:14:31,110 --> 01:14:37,155
We actually got an estimate from contractors that do the paving.

1240
01:14:37,955 --> 01:14:38,576
They do parks.

1241
01:14:39,256 --> 01:14:51,326
So we got estimates on what it costs to do repair of cracks and sealants and all that and repainting versus if the pulverizing ones are basically taking it all out and putting on new asphalt.

1242
01:14:51,927 --> 01:14:55,489
And then did those contractors decide which parks to do?

1243
01:14:56,623 --> 01:14:57,504
It didn't come from them.

1244
01:14:57,524 --> 01:15:06,557
It came from our parks department, came in and said these parks are really used heavily, especially like Placestead is our high school tennis team.

1245
01:15:07,758 --> 01:15:12,324
So they came in and they did an analysis of all the different parks and what issues are we seeing.

1246
01:15:12,364 --> 01:15:13,306
Like Harris was used

1247
01:15:13,626 --> 01:15:15,827
a crazy amount of kids play at Harris Park.

1248
01:15:16,067 --> 01:15:17,307
So that had to be addressed.

1249
01:15:17,447 --> 01:15:27,671
So it was really looking at the usage and the need to get these parks safe, and the ones that are used for tennis, to get them so that they can play on them, as opposed to some tennis fields.

1250
01:15:27,991 --> 01:15:28,851
I went by one today.

1251
01:15:28,871 --> 01:15:32,012
It looks like a dog park to me, but it happens.

1252
01:15:32,232 --> 01:15:39,595
And some aren't really used for the purpose that was intended, and they've gone circle with the residents how they want to use their facility.

1253
01:15:42,180 --> 01:15:43,521
But this is a quality of life.

1254
01:15:43,621 --> 01:15:47,343
I mean, our parks, as we all know, are very important to our quality of life.

1255
01:15:47,563 --> 01:15:48,183
No, I agree.

1256
01:15:48,223 --> 01:15:50,524
And I always talk about maintaining our parks.

1257
01:15:50,745 --> 01:15:58,269
My concern is why are Car Park and Barry Park and the parks that were left out, why are they left out?

1258
01:15:58,289 --> 01:15:58,629
That's my concern.

1259
01:15:58,649 --> 01:15:59,849
I think Barry was recently done.

1260
01:16:00,170 --> 01:16:06,933
This is based upon the need, the assessment of the condition they were in and the use that they get for these particular purposes.

1261
01:16:06,973 --> 01:16:09,634
And the DPW Parks Department is the one who?

1262
01:16:10,095 --> 01:16:10,515
Yes, exactly.

1263
01:16:11,849 --> 01:16:15,010
And can you just explain a little bit about the mausoleum study?

1264
01:16:16,450 --> 01:16:21,592
The cemetery has been talking for several months now about trying to get a study going.

1265
01:16:22,032 --> 01:16:29,455
Because right now, with the actual estimate is on the land that we look at that we think is the cemetery, there's about 10 years left.

1266
01:16:30,015 --> 01:16:40,158
Then there is the pile, and there's also land within the Brooks Estates, what you would think is the Brooks Estates area, which expands the life expectancy of the cemetery.

1267
01:16:40,858 --> 01:16:49,825
So they have been talking about doing a study to determine if it makes sense, how do you finance it, where would it be if it was in our cemetery.

1268
01:16:50,766 --> 01:16:54,208
So the only way you can come up with that information is to have a study performed.

1269
01:16:54,429 --> 01:17:00,593
So that's what the objective is and the cemetery commissioners had requested that we attempt to do this.

1270
01:17:01,334 --> 01:17:03,716
Is that through a specific company or?

1271
01:17:03,736 --> 01:17:06,938
No, this is, we'd have to go out to bid.

1272
01:17:06,958 --> 01:17:08,179
Oh, out to bid on this one too, okay.

1273
01:17:09,778 --> 01:17:10,639
just point of clarification.

1274
01:17:11,059 --> 01:17:13,660
Point of clarification, Councilor Penta.

1275
01:17:14,041 --> 01:17:15,701
Did you just say there's only 10 years left?

1276
01:17:15,741 --> 01:17:18,563
That's not the- 10 in what we visualize that we look at.

1277
01:17:18,623 --> 01:17:20,864
I believe we were told it was approximately 30 years left.

1278
01:17:20,884 --> 01:17:21,605
No, no, no, no.

1279
01:17:21,645 --> 01:17:30,610
We were told 10, and if you incorporate the other areas that we really don't look at, that we don't, it doesn't look like it's per se the cemetery, it could go up to 20, but that's it.

1280
01:17:32,211 --> 01:17:34,352
Well, you have the new growth over there that's taking place now.

1281
01:17:34,372 --> 01:17:37,174
You have six and a half acres on the opposite side from the Brooks Estates area.

1282
01:17:37,194 --> 01:17:38,655
It's the estimate that we've been given.

1283
01:17:39,257 --> 01:17:39,737
From who though?

1284
01:17:40,078 --> 01:17:42,759
From the Cemetery Commission.

1285
01:17:43,159 --> 01:17:44,100
Could we further amend that?

1286
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:51,324
Tell us to give us a breakdown, a layout, what they anticipate and for the years, how they made that determination.

1287
01:17:51,344 --> 01:17:52,465
Anticipated?

1288
01:17:53,085 --> 01:17:53,325
Yes.

1289
01:17:53,745 --> 01:17:54,286
Locations.

1290
01:17:54,386 --> 01:17:56,667
The actual physical locations at the cemetery.

1291
01:17:57,107 --> 01:17:58,208
Of the 10 year projection.

1292
01:17:58,288 --> 01:17:58,828
Of the 10 year.

1293
01:17:58,968 --> 01:18:00,309
And many people are dying per year.

1294
01:18:01,590 --> 01:18:01,990
Yeah.

1295
01:18:02,370 --> 01:18:03,471
Half of them may already own a plot.

1296
01:18:03,751 --> 01:18:06,313
Oh, they could, but that doesn't mean that it's going to be used.

1297
01:18:06,613 --> 01:18:07,033
No, exactly.

1298
01:18:08,165 --> 01:18:09,466
So we'll ask how they get to that.

1299
01:18:09,506 --> 01:18:12,068
That's fourth amendment from Councilor Penta.

1300
01:18:12,128 --> 01:18:12,248
Yeah.

1301
01:18:13,009 --> 01:18:23,377
Um, and then on top of that, I want a second Councilor Penta's, um, motion that the public arts funds be broken down and we understand how that is going to be spent.

1302
01:18:24,358 --> 01:18:29,081
Um, my, if I could motion to make sure Ms.

1303
01:18:29,662 --> 01:18:35,746
Burke, Director Burke, you said the 10,000 for the cameras, it's about 2,500 for a stationary one.

1304
01:18:35,766 --> 01:18:36,487
I would just,

1305
01:18:37,301 --> 01:18:43,323
recommend and ask my colleagues to make it mandatory that one portable camera be purchased.

1306
01:18:43,623 --> 01:18:44,503
Mandatory?

1307
01:18:45,564 --> 01:18:47,984
We'll make a recommendation that one of them is mandatory, right?

1308
01:18:48,324 --> 01:18:51,245
I think that would be amenable if we can accommodate it with the estimate.

1309
01:18:51,285 --> 01:18:52,226
One would be portable.

1310
01:18:54,326 --> 01:18:55,327
One portable camera.

1311
01:18:55,747 --> 01:18:56,067
Okay.

1312
01:18:57,267 --> 01:18:58,167
You have the floor, Councillor.

1313
01:18:58,308 --> 01:18:58,728
Anything else?

1314
01:18:59,888 --> 01:19:00,568
Councillor Lungo-Kerr.

1315
01:19:02,049 --> 01:19:02,569
That's it for me.

1316
01:19:02,729 --> 01:19:03,049
Okay.

1317
01:19:03,089 --> 01:19:03,689
Councillor Marks.

1318
01:19:04,830 --> 01:19:05,770
Thank you, Mr. President.

1319
01:19:06,907 --> 01:19:11,689
Regarding the mausoleum study, this council voted back several years ago.

1320
01:19:11,769 --> 01:19:19,211
And actually, we just recently, Mr. President, took it off of unfinished business after being on the agenda for a number of years.

1321
01:19:20,191 --> 01:19:23,993
But I wholeheartedly agree with that particular study.

1322
01:19:24,393 --> 01:19:33,176
It'll extend the life of the cemetery for a number of years for Meffitt residents if we were to build a mausoleum at the cemetery.

1323
01:19:33,196 --> 01:19:34,496
So I wholeheartedly support that.

1324
01:19:35,202 --> 01:19:36,703
A couple of questions I had.

1325
01:19:36,803 --> 01:19:41,685
The first one is regarding the speed bumps that were mentioned.

1326
01:19:42,906 --> 01:19:46,168
In order to put a speed bump on a road, you need approval by the Traffic Commission.

1327
01:19:47,188 --> 01:19:49,709
Have they voted on allowing speed bumps?

1328
01:19:49,729 --> 01:19:52,471
This would have to go to them for direct locations.

1329
01:19:53,091 --> 01:19:55,612
So they would have to approve the locations once they purchase.

1330
01:19:55,952 --> 01:20:00,195
They've obviously been in the discussions on the two streets that you have raised in the past.

1331
01:20:00,215 --> 01:20:02,976
But we don't know whether or not they'll approve speed bumps on our roads.

1332
01:20:03,385 --> 01:20:07,226
We currently don't have any portable or ever had any portable speed bumps.

1333
01:20:07,986 --> 01:20:12,448
So it's your opinion that this will go through the traffic commission without a problem.

1334
01:20:12,468 --> 01:20:13,448
It's more of the location.

1335
01:20:14,508 --> 01:20:16,909
It's more than our meeting earlier this evening.

1336
01:20:17,229 --> 01:20:32,073
And the reason why I say that is, uh, since I've been on the council, we've had a number of residents that have come up before us requesting these movable speed bumps on particular roads, uh, to calm traffic and calm speed is down.

1337
01:20:32,582 --> 01:20:38,227
And we were always told that you can't impede traffic and so forth by the chief of police.

1338
01:20:39,248 --> 01:20:44,813
And now it seems on a major thoroughfare, two major thoroughfares, we're looking at installing these.

1339
01:20:45,333 --> 01:20:53,760
So I just don't know what the change of mind is all of a sudden, when before it was always just a dead no to the council when we asked.

1340
01:20:54,361 --> 01:20:56,483
Well, I think they've seen the raised crosswalk.

1341
01:20:57,735 --> 01:20:58,796
and what that has done.

1342
01:20:59,336 --> 01:21:02,938
So obviously there's evidence now in the city.

1343
01:21:03,218 --> 01:21:05,499
Race crosswalks have been around for 25 years.

1344
01:21:06,659 --> 01:21:08,340
We haven't created the race crosswalk.

1345
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:11,262
I mean, they've been using the cities for years, but okay.

1346
01:21:11,282 --> 01:21:16,844
You know, I just don't like to approve money when we don't have an official vote of the traffic commission purpose.

1347
01:21:16,944 --> 01:21:20,086
So if this purpose was not, it would come back.

1348
01:21:21,106 --> 01:21:22,607
I couldn't go to something else.

1349
01:21:22,687 --> 01:21:24,068
It's this perfect purpose.

1350
01:21:25,609 --> 01:21:25,849
Okay.

1351
01:21:26,029 --> 01:21:30,372
But my inclination is that it's more the location that would have to be voted on.

1352
01:21:30,853 --> 01:21:31,113
Okay.

1353
01:21:31,673 --> 01:21:34,455
Um, I agree with all the different park work.

1354
01:21:34,575 --> 01:21:35,896
Uh, I think that's long overdue.

1355
01:21:35,916 --> 01:21:50,425
Uh, I would also just ask if we could amend this paper, Mr. President, uh, Harris park as a council, um, a budget, uh, director Burke just mentioned is, is a park that's used, uh, 12 months out of the year.

1356
01:21:50,946 --> 01:21:51,586
It really is.

1357
01:21:51,626 --> 01:21:54,348
And it's a heavy traveled park in the taut lot.

1358
01:21:54,783 --> 01:21:56,324
I've brought up on a dozen occasions.

1359
01:21:57,584 --> 01:21:59,745
It no longer is a tot lot.

1360
01:22:00,365 --> 01:22:07,228
It is a lot where animals go and do their business because it's mulch.

1361
01:22:08,009 --> 01:22:10,370
And it's in awful condition.

1362
01:22:10,530 --> 01:22:14,151
If people went down to the parks, as you mentioned, that would have been the first thing.

1363
01:22:14,192 --> 01:22:22,155
We've asked that a rubberized flooring be put in, like many of the other parks, first of all, for safety purposes in a tot lot.

1364
01:22:22,573 --> 01:22:29,477
and also to keep animals from going in there and making that their little place where they dig and do their business.

1365
01:22:30,118 --> 01:22:33,620
And that's what it's coming to, and people aren't using that tarp lot anymore.

1366
01:22:33,700 --> 01:22:43,866
So I would ask that that area, it's not a giant area to be rubberized, I think would suit its purpose and also benefit many people in that area.

1367
01:22:45,907 --> 01:22:51,310
And the other issue, and I had a discussion with the mayor this afternoon regarding all these items,

1368
01:22:52,782 --> 01:23:02,608
I asked him about the number of stumps that were going to be removed, and if the 400,000, which includes the water, if there was some water damage and so forth from flooding.

1369
01:23:03,769 --> 01:23:06,791
He said it would cover, or he hopes it covers all the stumps.

1370
01:23:07,651 --> 01:23:15,216
And my response is that I believe that the current city stump list underestimates what we have out in the city.

1371
01:23:15,836 --> 01:23:21,099
No fault of the city, but if they claim there's 180 stumps, I say there's 280 in our community.

1372
01:23:22,677 --> 01:23:28,598
And what I would ask is really the only legitimate way of doing this, because we've asked that a complete audit be done.

1373
01:23:28,618 --> 01:23:30,959
I don't know if that's taken place or not.

1374
01:23:30,979 --> 01:23:39,761
And I know there's other priorities, but if we spent a lot of time actually, well, we probably did, but there's some stumps that they're Browning on top.

1375
01:23:39,801 --> 01:23:40,861
That's how long they've been there.

1376
01:23:40,961 --> 01:23:43,402
And you know, you can see they're really aging.

1377
01:23:43,962 --> 01:23:47,323
And I would ask that we put the stump list on the city website.

1378
01:23:48,197 --> 01:23:51,978
So if you have a stump in front of your house, you don't have to say, well, I called five years ago.

1379
01:23:51,998 --> 01:23:53,099
I don't know if it's still on there.

1380
01:23:53,419 --> 01:23:54,219
I don't know what's happening.

1381
01:23:54,699 --> 01:23:57,780
You can actually look at the stump list and say, I'm not on this list.

1382
01:23:57,960 --> 01:23:58,901
I think I should have been on.

1383
01:24:00,121 --> 01:24:06,263
And then contact DPW or send an email, call a counselor, and get yourself on the stump list.

1384
01:24:06,723 --> 01:24:10,365
And I think that's an effective way of managing what's currently out there.

1385
01:24:10,685 --> 01:24:13,786
And I think we're going to find that the 180 is probably not 180.

1386
01:24:13,906 --> 01:24:14,926
It's more like 280.

1387
01:24:15,667 --> 01:24:16,807
That's my own personal opinion.

1388
01:24:17,526 --> 01:24:18,607
from traversing the city.

1389
01:24:18,987 --> 01:24:28,014
So I would ask that as part of this paper, Mr. President, that we ask that the full stump list be put on for review for residents.

1390
01:24:28,035 --> 01:24:28,635
On the city website?

1391
01:24:28,755 --> 01:24:29,636
On the city website.

1392
01:24:31,657 --> 01:24:37,222
And the only other question I really had was regarding the lead conversion.

1393
01:24:38,263 --> 01:24:39,824
Any idea how long that's going to take?

1394
01:24:40,894 --> 01:24:42,675
I think it's a very quick process, actually.

1395
01:24:43,136 --> 01:24:46,658
So I know Joe has been dying to get this going.

1396
01:24:47,279 --> 01:24:49,541
I don't know if you've all heard, he is retiring in January.

1397
01:24:51,722 --> 01:24:56,326
So I don't know if he'll get to see this to fruition, but it will probably be over the springtime.

1398
01:24:57,267 --> 01:24:58,488
So we're looking at the springtime?

1399
01:24:58,508 --> 01:24:59,749
Springtime.

1400
01:24:59,769 --> 01:25:00,449
Do we have to go out?

1401
01:25:00,789 --> 01:25:05,733
I'm not sure if they would do this in-house or it would be bid out through an electrical-type company.

1402
01:25:05,773 --> 01:25:07,875
So I'm not quite sure on that process yet.

1403
01:25:08,215 --> 01:25:10,477
And are they still currently changing the lenses?

1404
01:25:11,315 --> 01:25:13,976
I believe he said earlier tonight that he's finished changing the lenses.

1405
01:25:14,377 --> 01:25:17,678
I've, I'll spot them out to him, but I've seen a number of them in the school.

1406
01:25:17,698 --> 01:25:17,818
Yeah.

1407
01:25:18,278 --> 01:25:20,139
The ones that they've ordered have all gone in.

1408
01:25:20,159 --> 01:25:22,781
So there are a few and you want to send me an email.

1409
01:25:22,861 --> 01:25:23,041
Right.

1410
01:25:23,081 --> 01:25:24,622
I don't think it's completed as of yet.

1411
01:25:24,642 --> 01:25:26,903
I think he's used all the ones he's ordered.

1412
01:25:27,563 --> 01:25:27,823
Okay.

1413
01:25:28,463 --> 01:25:31,585
And also, uh, up the hillside, I had a business owner that called me.

1414
01:25:31,665 --> 01:25:33,626
I went up, uh, last week actually.

1415
01:25:34,346 --> 01:25:39,849
And, uh, the side where the liquor store is on up the hillside, that whole area is completely dark at night.

1416
01:25:41,048 --> 01:25:48,594
And it looks like it's actually missing, not that streetlights are out, that it's missing streetlights.

1417
01:25:50,275 --> 01:25:57,601
The liquor store up the hillside, right across from Hillside Hardware.

1418
01:25:57,621 --> 01:26:01,564
That whole section over there is completely dark.

1419
01:26:02,285 --> 01:26:04,146
And someone needs to take a look at that.

1420
01:26:05,967 --> 01:26:09,790
If I could, Mr. President, when we're talking about light conversion.

1421
01:26:11,193 --> 01:26:14,694
Other than that, I support everything that's on this paper.

1422
01:26:16,935 --> 01:26:18,056
It all makes sense to me.

1423
01:26:18,476 --> 01:26:24,258
I appreciate the fact that we're able to go through it and ask questions, not just for our ratification.

1424
01:26:24,278 --> 01:26:28,119
You know, it's easy for a councilor to sit back and say, I'm well aware of this.

1425
01:26:28,179 --> 01:26:28,960
I attended a meeting.

1426
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,441
I talked to the mayor, and this is great for the general public.

1427
01:26:31,981 --> 01:26:40,324
But it's interesting to hear, and that's why people tune in, to listen and hear what's going on and be able to ask questions.

1428
01:26:40,837 --> 01:26:51,141
and it's great to have meetings that are open to the public, but we all know, I mean, we have a meeting up here every night, and if you get 10, every Tuesday night, if you get 10 people, you're lucky.

1429
01:26:51,681 --> 01:26:54,362
A Committee of the Whole meeting, if you get three people, you're lucky.

1430
01:26:54,902 --> 01:26:57,183
Of a city of 57,000 people.

1431
01:26:57,763 --> 01:27:06,286
So I don't buy into the fact that just because there's a Committee of the Whole, that everyone else in the community's on board, and I think this is very helpful to sit and go through it.

1432
01:27:06,666 --> 01:27:09,767
It didn't take long to do, and I thank Councilor Penter

1433
01:27:10,711 --> 01:27:18,993
bringing this up, because it's an important issue that we go through and get the answers, not only on behalf of the council, but on behalf of the people of this community.

1434
01:27:20,974 --> 01:27:21,694
Councillor Penta.

1435
01:27:22,754 --> 01:27:26,475
Stephanie, go back to the retaining walls on Governor's Avenue.

1436
01:27:26,955 --> 01:27:27,995
You just jogged my mind.

1437
01:27:28,375 --> 01:27:34,617
When we did those walls back then, we had to go and get permission from the abutting residents that abutted the wall.

1438
01:27:35,577 --> 01:27:38,738
And the purpose of doing that was to cut the trees down that were

1439
01:27:39,337 --> 01:27:41,179
having their roots pushing the wall out.

1440
01:27:42,419 --> 01:27:49,285
Now, nothing's been done since then to go back on the wall that we spent a few hundred thousand dollars on and now you're adding on.

1441
01:27:49,525 --> 01:27:56,871
I'm just, can we get a report back as to why the city has not kept up with stopping those trees from regrowing?

1442
01:27:56,971 --> 01:27:57,531
Yeah.

1443
01:27:58,232 --> 01:28:06,458
Well, not only that, it's the trees that maybe three to four feet, you know, you have the wall and then there's three or four feet going back on the land over there.

1444
01:28:07,219 --> 01:28:08,080
And that was the, uh,

1445
01:28:09,070 --> 01:28:14,131
That was the thing that was negotiated by the city and the residents, making sure that you weren't on their property.

1446
01:28:14,151 --> 01:28:14,972
It was the city's property.

1447
01:28:15,212 --> 01:28:20,173
And they cut those trees down, making sure that the growth of those trees were not pushing the wall out.

1448
01:28:20,913 --> 01:28:23,774
But since that wall has been fixed, the trees have regrown.

1449
01:28:23,834 --> 01:28:24,494
You have new trees.

1450
01:28:25,254 --> 01:28:28,715
And they're doing the same thing with the new addition of the wall.

1451
01:28:32,696 --> 01:28:35,937
And the second thing, Mr. President, just jumping back onto the Peace Garden.

1452
01:28:36,708 --> 01:28:43,473
I think this was brought up, and I don't know who brought it up, but if and when this thing is finally built, who's going to take care of it?

1453
01:28:44,373 --> 01:28:44,914
City of Medford.

1454
01:28:45,934 --> 01:28:46,495
City of Medford.

1455
01:28:47,075 --> 01:28:48,256
Highway department's going to take care of it?

1456
01:28:48,276 --> 01:28:49,256
Parks department.

1457
01:28:49,637 --> 01:28:50,757
Parks department's going to take care of it.

1458
01:28:52,398 --> 01:28:53,819
Point of information, Councilor Lachs.

1459
01:28:54,520 --> 01:28:59,703
We were told by the mayor himself that fountains were going to be maintained by an outside group.

1460
01:29:00,064 --> 01:29:03,166
I mean the mowings and things like that, the everyday stuff.

1461
01:29:04,326 --> 01:29:05,227
We don't fix fountains.

1462
01:29:06,313 --> 01:29:06,493
Right.

1463
01:29:06,533 --> 01:29:08,615
So, so the maintenance will not be done by the city.

1464
01:29:08,675 --> 01:29:10,496
It'll be done by cleaning.

1465
01:29:10,636 --> 01:29:12,037
I meant the everyday maintenance.

1466
01:29:12,758 --> 01:29:12,938
Right.

1467
01:29:12,998 --> 01:29:14,179
I mean, there's not much moment to do.

1468
01:29:14,239 --> 01:29:17,542
It's the size of a match book.

1469
01:29:19,323 --> 01:29:24,647
So there is going to be an expense that a perpetual care fund will have to be set up to maintain just the fountains.

1470
01:29:25,357 --> 01:29:33,583
The hope is once everything is all said and done, there will be excess funds that can be put into one of the trust accounts that the commissioners of trust maintain right now.

1471
01:29:34,023 --> 01:29:40,907
And that would be used to, um, similar to the cemetery special care for those, those things, but not for everyday.

1472
01:29:40,947 --> 01:29:43,329
Thank you.

1473
01:29:43,689 --> 01:29:44,069
Thank you.

1474
01:29:44,730 --> 01:29:52,935
Mr. President, could you explain further, um, if the 250,000 from when what's the next payment after that?

1475
01:29:54,205 --> 01:29:59,827
I think it's a year after they're in operation.

1476
01:30:00,007 --> 01:30:06,850
Once they open their doors, then that's when you're going to see payments come through for a multitude of different purposes.

1477
01:30:07,290 --> 01:30:08,891
But that's not until they open their doors.

1478
01:30:08,971 --> 01:30:13,153
So that's not going to be the same as Everett getting millions of dollars each and every year, even before they open?

1479
01:30:13,193 --> 01:30:17,434
Not until the doors open.

1480
01:30:20,556 --> 01:30:23,517
And maybe you can answer this question, and then I'm done.

1481
01:30:24,822 --> 01:30:31,625
Um, with these new kiosks that are coming in, um, that the council never had a final vote on, but that's beside the point.

1482
01:30:33,806 --> 01:30:46,391
How is the city going to, we have educated drivers out there and speaking to a couple of the people right now that from Winchester that are parking here, once they realize they're going to get tagged, they're not going to stay here.

1483
01:30:47,351 --> 01:30:50,973
So who's going to make up that difference of the $2 million per year?

1484
01:30:51,250 --> 01:30:54,873
You think Medford residents are gonna go out there and get themselves tagged for $2 million a year?

1485
01:30:55,133 --> 01:30:55,673
I don't think so.

1486
01:30:55,713 --> 01:30:59,036
No, I don't think it's gonna come from Medford residents being tagged.

1487
01:30:59,096 --> 01:31:01,778
It'll be from people paying for their parking.

1488
01:31:02,379 --> 01:31:07,963
You'll lose some of the scofflaws that are out there now that have been abusing our city, coming from external areas.

1489
01:31:08,583 --> 01:31:12,166
If they still wanna come in and be able to walk to the train, they're gonna have to pay to park.

1490
01:31:13,247 --> 01:31:16,329
And it's just gonna be the way it is.

1491
01:31:16,349 --> 01:31:19,872
They're gonna have to go along with the rules.

1492
01:31:20,730 --> 01:31:26,753
But there is a provisional in the contract that if they do less than $2 million a year, it gets prorated down as to what the city gets, correct?

1493
01:31:27,013 --> 01:31:29,194
There's two elements to the contract.

1494
01:31:29,214 --> 01:31:35,156
There's the fixed piece, which is the guarantee, and then there's the above a break-even point.

1495
01:31:36,017 --> 01:31:43,860
So anytime you reach that break-even point, then it splits off where the city gets the big chunk of the overage.

1496
01:31:44,720 --> 01:31:46,901
So it's not a $2 million number.

1497
01:31:47,081 --> 01:31:47,481
I think it was $900.

1498
01:31:49,283 --> 01:31:54,546
$975,000.

1499
01:31:49,463 --> 01:31:54,546
Anything above that, I think we're at 83 percent.

1500
01:31:55,026 --> 01:31:56,707
So it's not a million dollars.

1501
01:31:56,787 --> 01:31:57,648
That's not the number.

1502
01:31:58,908 --> 01:32:10,915
And lastly, Mr. President, we were supposed to have gotten an update, and we never got it, regarding the West Method parking lot, where we stand, what's the cost factor going to involve, what's the process, how is this contamination going to be eliminated?

1503
01:32:13,859 --> 01:32:16,940
But isn't the city putting any money aside because they're going to have to come up with some money for this?

1504
01:32:16,980 --> 01:32:23,583
Right now, it's all been through the federal grant that the... Yeah, but if this has to get into the millions of dollars... Right, but we're not there.

1505
01:32:23,623 --> 01:32:34,828
They're doing all this work right now to determine the scope and how far it extends, and it's all been covered through the EPA grant thus far.

1506
01:32:38,250 --> 01:32:38,610
All right.

1507
01:32:39,910 --> 01:32:41,091
Is there a motion on the paper?

1508
01:32:43,369 --> 01:32:46,150
on the motion as amended, and then Ms.

1509
01:32:46,190 --> 01:32:48,170
Martin will give them the opportunity to speak.

1510
01:32:48,190 --> 01:32:50,311
I'm going to read the form, actually, Ms.

1511
01:32:50,351 --> 01:32:51,551
Martin, and then I'll read the amendments.

1512
01:32:53,491 --> 01:32:54,932
Name and address for the record.

1513
01:32:54,972 --> 01:32:56,952
Gene Martin, thank you, 10 Cumming Street.

1514
01:32:57,572 --> 01:33:01,013
I'm glad you brought it up again, and I'm glad you went through it line by line.

1515
01:33:01,593 --> 01:33:09,155
I do still think that the police chief shouldn't have to get up here at the podium and ask for a basic thing, like the building.

1516
01:33:10,067 --> 01:33:10,828
He shouldn't have to.

1517
01:33:11,328 --> 01:33:16,975
Nor should the union representative have to come up here and beg for a decent building to work out of.

1518
01:33:17,415 --> 01:33:18,557
I just don't think so.

1519
01:33:18,997 --> 01:33:20,459
I think that the parks are luxuries.

1520
01:33:21,260 --> 01:33:21,460
I do.

1521
01:33:22,352 --> 01:33:24,613
The schools are not, but the parks are luxuries.

1522
01:33:25,053 --> 01:33:27,914
Yes, they add to the quality of life, and yes, the memorial does.

1523
01:33:28,474 --> 01:33:30,355
Speaking as a veteran, it's still a luxury.

1524
01:33:31,815 --> 01:33:35,076
Some of the other issues are still luxuries.

1525
01:33:35,376 --> 01:33:37,517
The bike, everything's done in piecemeal again.

1526
01:33:37,857 --> 01:33:43,779
I just hear, you know, a bike path, you know, just on Winthrop Street, and the bikers are here to stay.

1527
01:33:44,739 --> 01:33:48,506
I don't think it's safe personally to have bikes on the streets, but they are here to stay.

1528
01:33:48,987 --> 01:33:55,859
So we need to work with the bike community, but we need to do these things as a full city project, not piecemeal.

1529
01:33:57,107 --> 01:33:58,687
enforcement that's out of control.

1530
01:33:59,127 --> 01:34:00,988
There's illegal parking here, there, and everywhere.

1531
01:34:01,268 --> 01:34:06,089
So how can you make a plan for where the lines are going to go when the parking isn't straightened out yet?

1532
01:34:06,569 --> 01:34:12,530
Everything's done in piecemeal, and I just hear that resounding in my head as you went line by line.

1533
01:34:13,070 --> 01:34:15,410
I want to see the arts community, and we need them.

1534
01:34:15,950 --> 01:34:16,930
I need Mr. Lincoln.

1535
01:34:17,370 --> 01:34:18,751
The city needs Mr. Lincoln.

1536
01:34:19,391 --> 01:34:20,691
I know sometimes I'm hard on him.

1537
01:34:21,231 --> 01:34:24,452
I'm hard on Mr. Koenig, or whatever his name is, the bike guys.

1538
01:34:25,172 --> 01:34:26,392
I'm hard on all of these people.

1539
01:34:27,032 --> 01:34:27,352
Okay?

1540
01:34:27,973 --> 01:34:28,553
We need them.

1541
01:34:29,374 --> 01:34:30,395
I'm inviting them up here.

1542
01:34:30,455 --> 01:34:31,896
I want them to speak up.

1543
01:34:32,716 --> 01:34:39,662
But I also want them to come up here and speak on behalf of the police chief and the police union and get this building done.

1544
01:34:39,802 --> 01:34:44,645
I want to hear them petition for the police department before all of these other extras come in.

1545
01:34:45,606 --> 01:34:54,553
And if they can do that, then maybe I'll be able to have more peace about allowing more money for the old house

1546
01:34:55,086 --> 01:34:57,829
or the arts community or something that I consider a luxury.

1547
01:34:58,570 --> 01:35:02,914
Because one day you're going to need the police station here, and maybe sooner than you think.

1548
01:35:03,795 --> 01:35:06,337
And it's not going to be there when you need it to be there for you.

1549
01:35:06,838 --> 01:35:07,659
We have a lot of crime.

1550
01:35:07,939 --> 01:35:10,922
We have a lot of need for detective space in the building.

1551
01:35:11,502 --> 01:35:13,304
The police building was not designed for

1552
01:35:15,229 --> 01:35:16,230
2014.

1553
01:35:15,529 --> 01:35:16,230
We all know that.

1554
01:35:16,911 --> 01:35:20,335
So I feel like I'm pounded on the same door over and over and over again.

1555
01:35:20,675 --> 01:35:23,298
And I know you're sick of seeing me come up here and pound in on that door.

1556
01:35:23,839 --> 01:35:25,841
But I don't think that the police chief

1557
01:35:26,254 --> 01:35:29,315
should have to come up here, nor the police union representative.

1558
01:35:29,735 --> 01:35:30,755
I think it should be the people.

1559
01:35:31,275 --> 01:35:38,537
And if we have to close down all of the playgrounds and the football field to get the attention of the people, you want to do that, I know you'll never do it.

1560
01:35:38,897 --> 01:35:40,157
But it's a radical idea.

1561
01:35:40,717 --> 01:35:46,438
But it would work because the people would be in here the next week saying, why did you close down my football field?

1562
01:35:46,898 --> 01:35:48,178
Well, because we need something.

1563
01:35:48,358 --> 01:35:51,099
We need your participation in the city's business.

1564
01:35:51,839 --> 01:35:53,319
So thank you very much for listening.

1565
01:35:53,680 --> 01:35:53,980
Thank you.

1566
01:35:54,760 --> 01:35:55,720
Name and address for the record, sir.

1567
01:35:56,722 --> 01:35:58,683
Bob Capucci, 71 Evans street.

1568
01:35:58,763 --> 01:36:00,524
Please forgive me if I'm speaking out of turn.

1569
01:36:00,564 --> 01:36:02,264
I came late and I didn't hear everything.

1570
01:36:02,925 --> 01:36:21,853
But, uh, with the passage of this new casino bill, and it's definitely coming here now and Everett, I don't know if a concerted effort between the city council and the mayor can be made to press upon the wind people to, to, I don't know if they have provisions,

1571
01:36:22,388 --> 01:36:33,892
But let's try to get some funding from them to do infrastructure improvements here in Medford because we're going to be impacted by this wind casino that's coming in.

1572
01:36:34,332 --> 01:36:45,476
And I believe they have it in their plans to help communities like ours get funding we need for a stronger police force and things like that.

1573
01:36:45,496 --> 01:36:48,818
So we don't have to do drastic things like lose the parks and things like that.

1574
01:36:49,931 --> 01:37:01,535
But I would hope that this city council and our mayor is going to press upon the wind people to fortify before that thing comes in here.

1575
01:37:01,575 --> 01:37:06,556
And we've got 10,000 cars out there in Wellington Circle Plaza and all sorts of stuff.

1576
01:37:06,636 --> 01:37:07,557
That's my two cents.

1577
01:37:07,617 --> 01:37:08,297
Thank you very much.

1578
01:37:08,802 --> 01:37:14,027
And part of one of the amendments this evening by Councilor Penter on this paper is regarding that very item.

1579
01:37:14,568 --> 01:37:17,590
All right, so I'm going to read the four amendments from Councilor Penter first.

1580
01:37:18,291 --> 01:37:23,796
The first one is to get a report back on bike lanes, the location, the width and the signage.

1581
01:37:24,777 --> 01:37:32,565
The second one is regarding the public arts funding and correct me if I'm wrong, rules and regulations and how the money is going to be dispersed by the superintendent of schools.

1582
01:37:34,380 --> 01:37:43,786
Number three is the breakdown of the monies from the Wynn Casino development, encumbered money and unencumbered money, correct?

1583
01:37:45,186 --> 01:37:54,952
And the locations and how they came up with the 10-year projection, the cemetery board,

1584
01:37:55,607 --> 01:37:58,810
of saying there's 10 years left of burials at Oak Grove Cemetery, correct?

1585
01:37:59,370 --> 01:38:05,875
And then we have, Councillor Lungo has an amendment, mandatory, one of the cameras is a portable camera, correct?

1586
01:38:06,715 --> 01:38:08,137
Councillor Marx has three amendments.

1587
01:38:08,197 --> 01:38:14,041
The first one, Harris Park Tot Lot rubberized due to the severe condition of it, correct Councillor?

1588
01:38:15,362 --> 01:38:18,785
The second, to put the stump list on the city website.

1589
01:38:19,669 --> 01:38:20,810
That's Councilor Marks as well.

1590
01:38:20,910 --> 01:38:28,515
And then last but not least, Councilor Marks, to repair the lighting on Boston Avenue in front of the liquor store and that block of stores.

1591
01:38:29,115 --> 01:38:36,200
And you'll furnish the clerk with the number, Councilor, of Boston Avenue, at least the number.

1592
01:38:36,220 --> 01:38:36,300
Okay.

1593
01:38:36,541 --> 01:38:38,402
From college down to the end of the stores.

1594
01:38:38,782 --> 01:38:39,022
Okay.

1595
01:38:39,563 --> 01:38:39,783
All right.

1596
01:38:39,983 --> 01:38:48,709
On the main motion of approval by Councilor De La Russo, as amended by several amendments of the Medford City Council,

1597
01:38:49,180 --> 01:38:55,444
The clerk will call the roll on passage of paper 14-743.

1598
01:38:55,464 --> 01:39:00,767
And once again, not to belabor the point, I apologize for making the wrong ruling earlier.

1599
01:39:01,007 --> 01:39:04,830
I'm glad all our questions were answered and we can move this city forward.

1600
01:39:04,890 --> 01:39:08,412
And I thank my council colleagues.

1601
01:39:08,472 --> 01:39:15,636
And so on 14-743, the clerk will call the roll on approval as amended of the total amount 1.386,

1602
01:39:18,893 --> 01:39:21,895
million dollars out of the certified free cash.

1603
01:39:23,796 --> 01:39:24,557
Councilor Penta.

1604
01:39:25,437 --> 01:39:28,739
We have another paper that's due next.

1605
01:39:29,600 --> 01:39:30,340
The other one that was?

1606
01:39:30,681 --> 01:39:30,941
Yes.

1607
01:39:30,981 --> 01:39:32,302
We can probably take that up next.

1608
01:39:32,322 --> 01:39:33,482
Do you want to make a motion for that?

1609
01:39:33,643 --> 01:39:34,223
Yeah.

1610
01:39:34,263 --> 01:39:35,284
What account did that come out of?

1611
01:39:36,424 --> 01:39:37,125
What account?

1612
01:39:38,186 --> 01:39:38,546
The $90,000?

1613
01:39:39,206 --> 01:39:39,807
Same account?

1614
01:39:40,447 --> 01:39:40,987
Free cash?

1615
01:39:42,328 --> 01:39:43,089
Why isn't it on here?

1616
01:39:43,109 --> 01:39:47,912
I wouldn't be able to.

1617
01:39:48,545 --> 01:39:53,766
I support that and the administration, not support it, but I have a financial interest in the area.

1618
01:39:53,806 --> 01:39:56,687
All right.

1619
01:39:57,827 --> 01:39:59,488
So not me, I'm up.

1620
01:40:00,188 --> 01:40:01,088
I'm sorry.

1621
01:40:01,708 --> 01:40:02,528
Motion for approval.

1622
01:40:03,429 --> 01:40:04,649
Second.

1623
01:40:04,669 --> 01:40:05,629
Second as amended.

1624
01:40:06,089 --> 01:40:06,449
What?

1625
01:40:07,449 --> 01:40:08,450
Vice President Caviello.

1626
01:40:08,550 --> 01:40:08,790
Yes.

1627
01:40:09,790 --> 01:40:10,630
Councilor Dela Russo.

1628
01:40:10,750 --> 01:40:11,050
Yes.

1629
01:40:11,350 --> 01:40:11,971
Councilor Knight.

1630
01:40:12,051 --> 01:40:12,471
Yes.

1631
01:40:12,731 --> 01:40:13,571
Councilor Curran.

1632
01:40:13,811 --> 01:40:14,011
Yes.

1633
01:40:14,491 --> 01:40:15,091
Councilor Martz.

1634
01:40:15,371 --> 01:40:15,571
Yes.

1635
01:40:15,851 --> 01:40:16,472
Councilor Penta.

1636
01:40:16,552 --> 01:40:16,772
Yes.

1637
01:40:17,312 --> 01:40:17,932
President Camuso.

1638
01:40:18,270 --> 01:40:22,872
Yes, by a vote of seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the paper is passed as amended.

1639
01:40:23,813 --> 01:40:25,534
The chair recognizes Councilor Penta.

1640
01:40:25,674 --> 01:40:33,518
Mr. President, I move that we take the paper as it relates to the Berks Estates, paper number, which one is it?

1641
01:40:33,538 --> 01:40:33,518
14744.

1642
01:40:33,598 --> 01:40:34,979
All those in favor, hear that paper?

1643
01:40:34,999 --> 01:40:37,820
All those opposed, the paper is back before you.

1644
01:40:49,168 --> 01:40:49,488
Thank you.

1645
01:40:49,608 --> 01:40:51,108
Yes, Mr. President.

1646
01:40:51,128 --> 01:40:51,208
Yes.

1647
01:40:51,228 --> 01:40:55,289
Motion for approval by Councilor DelaRusso.

1648
01:40:55,309 --> 01:40:56,149
Can you read it, please?

1649
01:40:56,749 --> 01:40:57,569
One second.

1650
01:40:57,589 --> 01:41:01,870
Let me get to it.

1651
01:41:01,890 --> 01:41:07,951
14-744 to all honorable members of the president and members of the Memphis City Council, so they all have been masked.

1652
01:41:07,991 --> 01:41:17,833
Dear Mr. President and City Council, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approve the appropriation of certified free cash in the amount of

1653
01:41:18,995 --> 01:41:27,739
$90,000 for structural repairs to the carriage house in addition to various roofing and sprinkler repairs at the Brooks Estate.

1654
01:41:28,319 --> 01:41:33,241
A representative from MDOT will be in attendance to answer any questions you may have.

1655
01:41:33,661 --> 01:41:34,682
Michael J. McGlynn, Mayor.

1656
01:41:35,182 --> 01:41:36,002
Councilor Dela Rousseau.

1657
01:41:36,022 --> 01:41:40,024
You have a motion to approval?

1658
01:41:40,624 --> 01:41:42,925
If I could move approval, Mr. President.

1659
01:41:42,945 --> 01:41:44,846
Move approval by Councilor Dela Rousseau.

1660
01:41:45,366 --> 01:41:45,906
Mr. President.

1661
01:41:46,427 --> 01:41:47,047
Councilor Penta.

1662
01:41:55,684 --> 01:41:59,667
Once again, it would be nice to have how $90,000 is going to be expended.

1663
01:42:00,668 --> 01:42:07,234
Even though Councilor DelaRosa moved approval, I think it's important for people to know how their money is being expended and its purpose.

1664
01:42:09,737 --> 01:42:10,157
I'm on.

1665
01:42:10,277 --> 01:42:10,838
Okay, thank you.

1666
01:42:10,858 --> 01:42:12,359
Name and address of the record, please.

1667
01:42:12,399 --> 01:42:12,959
Tom Lincoln.

1668
01:42:13,853 --> 01:42:14,493
I'm losing my voice.

1669
01:42:14,513 --> 01:42:15,314
It's been a long evening.

1670
01:42:15,574 --> 01:42:18,855
I reside at 27 Pleasant Street here in beautiful Medford.

1671
01:42:18,895 --> 01:42:21,257
I'm the president of the Medford Brooks Estate Land Trust.

1672
01:42:22,057 --> 01:42:32,462
As we hope you know, we are the all-volunteer community nonprofit that has spearheaded the protection and restoration of Medford's beautiful Brooks Estate.

1673
01:42:35,180 --> 01:42:43,965
This request has been built bottoms up from some of our inquiries and concerns.

1674
01:42:47,187 --> 01:42:50,569
As you know, this project has been going on a long time.

1675
01:42:50,749 --> 01:42:52,610
We've made tremendous progress.

1676
01:42:54,131 --> 01:42:58,093
And we have contributed or secured almost $1.5 million.

1677
01:42:58,113 --> 01:43:00,595
It's been applied to the Endeavor.

1678
01:43:01,335 --> 01:43:03,577
We spent a lot of our own money and

1679
01:43:04,623 --> 01:43:05,463
from donations.

1680
01:43:06,284 --> 01:43:17,688
We've paid already for a variety of restoration projects, the boiler portions of the roof, the alarm system furnishings, drainage, landscape, bathrooms, et cetera, et cetera.

1681
01:43:18,448 --> 01:43:26,131
We've also raised and spent money and labor on the habitat, trails, and natural landscape, and we hope everyone appreciates our efforts.

1682
01:43:26,191 --> 01:43:31,213
We've been working at this for over 15 years, playing a lot of catch-up ball.

1683
01:43:31,673 --> 01:43:33,074
I also want to thank the council.

1684
01:43:33,947 --> 01:43:39,749
for its ongoing support, particularly by supporting various CDBG resolutions.

1685
01:43:40,269 --> 01:43:48,131
A portion of the CDBG money is earmarked for historic preservation, and this has been an important source of ongoing funding.

1686
01:43:48,171 --> 01:43:53,373
We have reached the end of that rope because CDBG money is only available for slums and blight.

1687
01:43:53,513 --> 01:43:55,453
That's not my term, okay?

1688
01:43:58,123 --> 01:44:01,626
Much of what's been done has been in place now for over 10 years.

1689
01:44:02,286 --> 01:44:05,108
A certain amount of wear and tear has set in.

1690
01:44:05,949 --> 01:44:09,852
And there are areas that have been proven to be ongoing maintenance problems.

1691
01:44:10,412 --> 01:44:16,517
I think, frankly, one of them has probably been a maintenance problem for 134 years since the building was built.

1692
01:44:22,301 --> 01:44:24,482
Again, the Brooks estate has never had a maintenance budget.

1693
01:44:25,613 --> 01:44:32,197
And so this is somewhat of a maintenance and critical repair budget.

1694
01:44:33,697 --> 01:44:35,898
I'll just go over what the items are.

1695
01:44:37,860 --> 01:44:41,281
The costs here are based on some previous costs.

1696
01:44:41,822 --> 01:44:46,044
Frankly, some of these are obviously going to have to be bid to get more exact costs.

1697
01:44:52,438 --> 01:44:57,942
The other thing is these are old buildings, and there can be hidden contingencies.

1698
01:44:58,122 --> 01:45:07,749
It is typical in work of this sort to allow for a 10% contingency for historic preservation, maintenance, and repairs.

1699
01:45:08,430 --> 01:45:11,172
The two biggest items, the first one is the carriage house roof.

1700
01:45:11,592 --> 01:45:16,035
This was mentioned extensively in our discussion of Brooks & Sade master plan.

1701
01:45:16,896 --> 01:45:20,058
The roof was, the back half of the roof was rebuilt in about 1990.

1702
01:45:21,676 --> 01:45:23,256
which is almost a quarter century ago.

1703
01:45:24,337 --> 01:45:28,238
It has been repaired in pieces several times since then.

1704
01:45:29,118 --> 01:45:40,221
The last repair, as I recall, and again, there's been so many items, I don't have perfect recall, was about $11,000, and I was about a third of the area.

1705
01:45:40,301 --> 01:45:44,602
So we're estimating a cost of about $35,000 for this work.

1706
01:45:47,810 --> 01:45:57,195
There's been so much snow and so much weather that one of the cross joists has given way, and you're starting to see some sag.

1707
01:45:57,955 --> 01:46:13,803
This, like all these expenses, is an investment in the future, basically, and frankly, on the carriage houses as a holding action until the time comes in which we have secured, and the city has secured, sufficient funding for the complete restoration.

1708
01:46:14,623 --> 01:46:16,564
The second piece here is a good

1709
01:46:16,975 --> 01:46:23,059
group of needs based on the conditions at the front center of the Shepherd Brooks Manor.

1710
01:46:24,400 --> 01:46:29,363
If you know the building, it has a front center entrance with a very, very steep roof above it.

1711
01:46:30,504 --> 01:46:34,166
There's a massive roof on this building, over 6,500 square feet.

1712
01:46:34,867 --> 01:46:38,469
Part of this roof is now slate, part is copper.

1713
01:46:39,063 --> 01:46:44,646
It collects a tremendous amount of snow and ice.

1714
01:46:45,106 --> 01:46:50,128
That ice and snow generally sits there most of the winter because it's on the north side, doesn't get any sun.

1715
01:46:51,409 --> 01:46:57,472
And when it does let go, it comes down and whacks the small porch overhang that's below.

1716
01:46:58,152 --> 01:47:03,915
I dare say this has been a design flaw for well over... So the overhang has been damaged.

1717
01:47:05,216 --> 01:47:07,657
There is some infiltration of water from

1718
01:47:08,312 --> 01:47:14,073
This upper part of the roof, there are some missing slates, et cetera.

1719
01:47:16,193 --> 01:47:27,895
This will have to be, the porch overhang will have to be removed to see what's behind it, and some more investigation has to be done here.

1720
01:47:27,935 --> 01:47:36,797
But we think this, based on other roof costs that have been paid for over the years, and also the estimate for the addition of what are called snow guards,

1721
01:47:37,333 --> 01:47:41,714
Snow guard is a rack, basically.

1722
01:47:41,754 --> 01:47:45,295
You put across a roof, and it prevents the snow from doing this.

1723
01:47:45,335 --> 01:47:46,295
It breaks up the snow.

1724
01:47:47,016 --> 01:47:49,977
Should have been done earlier, but for whatever reason, it was not.

1725
01:47:50,017 --> 01:47:51,437
So it has to be retro installed.

1726
01:47:51,737 --> 01:47:55,678
We think that's about $30,000, but it will have to be spec'd and bid.

1727
01:47:56,118 --> 01:48:05,421
The other thing I should mention, Doug Carr, who's not here this evening, was at the Committee of the Whole meeting, who is the architect and restoration expert on our board.

1728
01:48:06,487 --> 01:48:20,317
has always provided specs and drawings, et cetera, for this kind of work, which has, I frankly, saved the city a great deal of money over the years, and we expect him to do the same thing for this.

1729
01:48:21,058 --> 01:48:23,800
The sprinkler system, the building is fully sprinklered.

1730
01:48:24,901 --> 01:48:31,326
We had some repairs done about a year ago, and we're told at that time that the sprinkler heads, which apparently last 50 to 55 years, who knew?

1731
01:48:33,989 --> 01:48:37,571
need to be replaced, and it's always better to replace them before they go.

1732
01:48:38,172 --> 01:48:51,178
This is a dry supply sprinkler system, which means that the sprinklers have air, and there's a compressor that's been rehabbed in the basement that keeps the water out until it's called for when the sprinkler head goes.

1733
01:48:51,818 --> 01:48:57,861
They're about $80 to $100 a piece, and there are about 65 or 70 of them in the building.

1734
01:48:57,881 --> 01:48:59,002
There are also a couple drainage

1735
01:48:59,701 --> 01:49:05,944
I don't even know what to call them, drainage parts that probably need to be replaced.

1736
01:49:07,365 --> 01:49:09,266
So that's about $7,000 there.

1737
01:49:10,246 --> 01:49:14,888
We've paid for a new boiler about three, four years ago.

1738
01:49:15,769 --> 01:49:17,549
I think it was $14,000 or $15,000.

1739
01:49:18,390 --> 01:49:22,632
One of the boiler circulator motors is starting to fail.

1740
01:49:23,052 --> 01:49:24,173
It's a two-zone system.

1741
01:49:24,833 --> 01:49:26,053
So that needs to be replaced.

1742
01:49:26,334 --> 01:49:28,034
And we've talked to Thompson, who's the guy that

1743
01:49:29,950 --> 01:49:36,575
company up there in North Medford that did the work originally, and that's probably about $1,000, but that would probably also include a tune-up.

1744
01:49:37,316 --> 01:49:38,917
The furnace is an oil furnace.

1745
01:49:38,937 --> 01:49:41,739
There's no gas yet at the Brooks Estate.

1746
01:49:43,100 --> 01:49:52,767
The portco share, which is a fancy word for the front main entrance where the carriages used to come, has needed pointing on the brick supports.

1747
01:49:53,528 --> 01:49:56,430
I'm sure you've all been there, but it's a very beautiful, but rather fancy

1748
01:49:57,192 --> 01:50:04,118
piece of brickwork, so we think that's about $5,000, more or less, for pointing there.

1749
01:50:04,379 --> 01:50:08,643
We've actually paid for other pointing on the front of the carriage house and at the veranda end.

1750
01:50:10,744 --> 01:50:19,052
There has been a lot of discussion about the alarm system, the city's replacement, the move towards a wireless or Wi-Fi alarm system.

1751
01:50:19,807 --> 01:50:32,235
The city has installed the antenna on the building, but some of the internal hardwired system needs to be tied into that.

1752
01:50:32,295 --> 01:50:33,936
Frankly, I don't know all the technology.

1753
01:50:34,557 --> 01:50:45,964
And I also don't know, frankly, we've been trying to find this out, whether this is going to be part of the larger alarm upgrade that has been discussed here tonight.

1754
01:50:46,024 --> 01:50:46,584
But I've put $4,000 in.

1755
01:50:48,352 --> 01:50:51,634
for that, and then a 10% contingency of $8,000.

1756
01:50:52,194 --> 01:50:56,056
So that's how that adds up.

1757
01:50:58,857 --> 01:51:09,502
The idea here is to stabilize – the carriage house is actually in pretty good shape, but the roof certainly

1758
01:51:10,213 --> 01:51:11,994
needs attention, very much so.

1759
01:51:12,034 --> 01:51:14,355
We've been talking about this for probably about a year.

1760
01:51:15,516 --> 01:51:25,981
I think the sprinkler system is sort of a no-brainer in terms of nothing is worse than a sprinkler system that goes off in an empty building, without a fire, obviously.

1761
01:51:29,442 --> 01:51:33,765
We really would like to solve this problem in the front at once and for all.

1762
01:51:33,865 --> 01:51:40,268
It's really the major external problem left on the exterior of the building.

1763
01:51:41,029 --> 01:51:44,391
The Brooks never had to worry about this because they never were there in the winter.

1764
01:51:45,351 --> 01:51:46,532
It was only a summer residence.

1765
01:51:46,912 --> 01:51:48,713
So that's what we're hoping for here.

1766
01:51:50,654 --> 01:51:52,235
We've been working hard.

1767
01:51:52,996 --> 01:51:56,938
We've made progress on a number of fronts.

1768
01:51:58,646 --> 01:52:03,390
on the project, and this is really critical stuff.

1769
01:52:03,671 --> 01:52:12,459
It's kind of a varied list, but it's critical items that really need to be addressed in order to move the project forward overall.

1770
01:52:13,320 --> 01:52:13,620
Thanks.

1771
01:52:14,661 --> 01:52:15,341
Thank you, Mr. Lincoln.

1772
01:52:16,142 --> 01:52:16,983
Council Member Kern.

1773
01:52:18,785 --> 01:52:22,128
My question was going to be to break down the figures, so thank you, Mr. Lincoln.

1774
01:52:22,812 --> 01:52:26,133
The roof, you said it has to be, about two-thirds of it has to be redone.

1775
01:52:26,453 --> 01:52:27,613
Why so high for $35,000?

1776
01:52:29,814 --> 01:52:38,557
Well, it's based, doing a third of it was about $11,000 the last time around.

1777
01:52:39,077 --> 01:52:43,138
It's not just putting tar paper or whatever you put on a roof.

1778
01:52:43,258 --> 01:52:51,401
It's the, some of the truss system inside on the back half of the roof has been compromised, and that'll need to be

1779
01:52:52,647 --> 01:52:56,950
I don't know what the word is, rebuilt or restrung.

1780
01:52:57,230 --> 01:52:58,011
These are big buildings.

1781
01:52:58,091 --> 01:53:03,114
A carriage house is about 50, 55 feet square.

1782
01:53:03,995 --> 01:53:06,696
And it's a great big mansard roof.

1783
01:53:07,217 --> 01:53:14,282
This also will protect the internal structure of the roof.

1784
01:53:14,342 --> 01:53:19,545
There are beams there, probably 14, 16 inches wide.

1785
01:53:19,605 --> 01:53:21,326
It's actually a thing of great beauty.

1786
01:53:23,969 --> 01:53:32,276
computer drawing of the eventual carriage house interior that will all be exposed in a sort of a cathedral fashion.

1787
01:53:32,856 --> 01:53:41,203
It may be less, but it needs to be spec'd out some more, but the clock is ticking on that.

1788
01:53:41,663 --> 01:53:51,451
And then Director Burke, who from the City of Medford has gone out to just inspect these five things just to make sure, you know, it's necessary?

1789
01:53:53,615 --> 01:53:57,776
The building commissioner has been out there.

1790
01:53:58,956 --> 01:53:59,216
Yes.

1791
01:53:59,797 --> 01:54:03,457
Karen Rose has been out there.

1792
01:54:03,477 --> 01:54:04,958
Lauren?

1793
01:54:05,138 --> 01:54:05,538
Yes, yes.

1794
01:54:06,298 --> 01:54:19,961
And we talked when the sprinkler system, previous repair was done, we had the city sprinkler person, I think it's Alpha Sprinkler if I'm right, down there on, I think they just moved, they were down on Boston Avenue.

1795
01:54:20,982 --> 01:54:22,382
And people from the,

1796
01:54:23,777 --> 01:54:24,477
fire department.

1797
01:54:25,217 --> 01:54:32,919
We've had a lot of experience on roofs, and the entire manor roof was redone in two stages.

1798
01:54:35,079 --> 01:54:38,260
The veranda roof has been redone.

1799
01:54:38,280 --> 01:54:44,561
And some of this is just pure observation.

1800
01:54:45,342 --> 01:54:52,023
If you take one look at the porch overhang, you can see that it's not long for this world.

1801
01:54:52,972 --> 01:54:57,673
and all these projects, director Burke will go to bed through the city.

1802
01:54:57,873 --> 01:54:58,294
Absolutely.

1803
01:54:58,314 --> 01:54:58,514
Yeah.

1804
01:54:58,874 --> 01:54:59,214
Thank you.

1805
01:55:00,834 --> 01:55:01,214
Thank you.

1806
01:55:01,695 --> 01:55:02,315
Councilor Marks.

1807
01:55:04,175 --> 01:55:05,196
Thank you, Mr. President.

1808
01:55:05,516 --> 01:55:15,118
And, um, I, I agree with many of these, uh, structural improvements and, uh, fixes to the roof and so forth of, uh, this historic property.

1809
01:55:16,019 --> 01:55:20,780
I think the larger issue that remains and we're all aware of is the access road.

1810
01:55:21,338 --> 01:55:23,039
leading up to the manor and the carriage house.

1811
01:55:23,840 --> 01:55:29,303
And it's been just probably several months since you've been before us.

1812
01:55:29,904 --> 01:55:32,005
Has there been any update?

1813
01:55:32,085 --> 01:55:47,616
We have met with the mayor and the fire chief, Paul Gear, several other people, forgive me if I don't remember at this point, basically getting issues out on the table.

1814
01:55:47,756 --> 01:55:50,518
But it's pretty clear to us, as we have said,

1815
01:55:53,701 --> 01:56:10,005
The road, the access drive, which has now been declared a drive, as you recall from Mr. Rumley, that there's an intersection between the design issues and utility issues, et cetera.

1816
01:56:10,125 --> 01:56:16,847
And we certainly feel that we need, I think the city needs to have a professional

1817
01:56:17,472 --> 01:56:20,574
uh, design engineering, uh, input there.

1818
01:56:20,815 --> 01:56:23,597
And the funds for that are not forthcoming at this point.

1819
01:56:24,237 --> 01:56:25,819
What are we talking roughly for?

1820
01:56:25,959 --> 01:56:46,475
Well, generally my understanding, I'm not in the business, but my understanding is that, uh, the, and we've talked a little bit to the council about this, at least theoretically, uh, that the, an RFP for a design, uh, that would have input, uh, from all interested parties, including the conservation commission,

1821
01:56:47,452 --> 01:56:54,457
the people that run the conservation restriction, et cetera, might be $100,000, something like that.

1822
01:56:54,977 --> 01:57:05,124
But that would give you, we've had discussions on and off with the city water people about the water supply running the pipe up the road.

1823
01:57:05,224 --> 01:57:06,144
You've heard all this, I think.

1824
01:57:07,305 --> 01:57:15,911
And we had an estimate via Alicia Hunt, just for fun, on a gas line to replace the oil burner.

1825
01:57:17,487 --> 01:57:19,709
at the manor, and that was $47,000.

1826
01:57:21,190 --> 01:57:31,036
But it makes sense to have one package for efficiency designed to have one package to decide on these issues.

1827
01:57:31,796 --> 01:57:35,518
So is EMBEL prepared to make a request to the administration?

1828
01:57:36,757 --> 01:57:48,080
Yes, we're thinking about the best way, we've been doing lots of things, the best way to move this forward.

1829
01:57:49,440 --> 01:58:01,404
So I think it's high on our list in terms of, because it's obviously, you know, the buildings are getting better and better, but the road has pretty much stayed the same.

1830
01:58:01,844 --> 01:58:05,965
There were some repairs done on the road this fall by the DPW.

1831
01:58:06,940 --> 01:58:07,781
in terms of potholes.

1832
01:58:08,121 --> 01:58:11,443
Right, but the study would be the first step in the process.

1833
01:58:11,463 --> 01:58:15,646
Yeah, it's... It'd answer a lot of questions that are lingering right now.

1834
01:58:15,666 --> 01:58:16,447
Yes, absolutely.

1835
01:58:16,847 --> 01:58:19,849
I think that's the logical conclusion we reached.

1836
01:58:20,470 --> 01:58:33,439
And if I had $100,000 to contribute to pay for the study, I would do it, but I don't, so... Well, you know, there seems to be a lot of money floating around from wind management, from free cash, and all other avenues around the city.

1837
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:35,561
And to me, this would be an issue

1838
01:58:36,552 --> 01:58:52,840
I think we all can appreciate the fact, whether you agree with funding for the Brooks Estates or not, that the access road is extremely important and is vital to the success of the Brooks Estates, even in its current condition.

1839
01:58:53,901 --> 01:58:59,384
And I, as one member, would hope that EMBELT approach the administration.

1840
01:58:59,824 --> 01:59:01,285
We will do that, absolutely.

1841
01:59:01,565 --> 01:59:02,665
And get this moving.

1842
01:59:08,787 --> 01:59:11,949
This is a project, as I've said many times, that has only grown.

1843
01:59:12,610 --> 01:59:19,775
And we're all volunteers, not looking for sympathy here, but we've spent a huge amount of time on this.

1844
01:59:21,136 --> 01:59:23,778
And I'm certainly no expert on road design.

1845
01:59:24,418 --> 01:59:31,183
I mean, I know a little bit about lots of things, but that's not one of them in terms of details.

1846
01:59:31,403 --> 01:59:33,945
But I appreciate the nudge here.

1847
01:59:35,246 --> 01:59:37,928
The city has embarked on feasibility studies for

1848
01:59:38,473 --> 01:59:45,937
the parking garage in Governor's Ave that never came to fruition, a feasibility study about a water taxi on the Mystic River.

1849
01:59:46,557 --> 01:59:55,682
And here we have an historic piece of property, as we all know, if not attended to, is going to end up vanishing into the ground eventually.

1850
01:59:56,423 --> 01:59:57,984
And I would hate to see that happen.

1851
01:59:58,584 --> 02:00:03,667
And I think for the amount of money we're talking about, it only makes sense

1852
02:00:04,417 --> 02:00:06,758
to move forward on that very basic issue of the access road.

1853
02:00:06,778 --> 02:00:08,039
I appreciate that.

1854
02:00:08,199 --> 02:00:08,499
Thank you.

1855
02:00:09,720 --> 02:00:10,360
Other questions?

1856
02:00:10,880 --> 02:00:11,421
That's it for me.

1857
02:00:11,641 --> 02:00:12,281
Thank you, Mr. Slingan.

1858
02:00:13,982 --> 02:00:14,902
Name and address of the record, please.

1859
02:00:16,503 --> 02:00:17,744
Jean Martin, 10 Cummings Street.

1860
02:00:17,784 --> 02:00:18,384
I know you're sick of me.

1861
02:00:21,382 --> 02:00:23,403
Again, it's not personal.

1862
02:00:23,443 --> 02:00:29,648
It's just that the principle is that I'm looking over here and this building could use $3.3 million to.

1863
02:00:29,668 --> 02:00:43,978
I mean, it's $90,000 today to hold it over so that in the future, hopefully, there'll be this cash flow of $3.3 million to renovate it so that it's actually a usable lot, a usable house, unfortunately.

1864
02:00:44,358 --> 02:00:49,502
So I just want you to be prepared and know all the facts that I'd rather see the money go to the library

1865
02:00:50,633 --> 02:00:57,000
for a $15,000 bathroom that never came to fruition because that money was used for an air conditioner someplace else, whatever.

1866
02:00:57,520 --> 02:01:02,926
You know, there are other needs in the community, in the city that are more pressing than this house, and it's not against the house.

1867
02:01:03,386 --> 02:01:05,168
And in fact, I like Mr. Lincoln.

1868
02:01:05,569 --> 02:01:07,451
The fact that he's saving the green space

1869
02:01:10,754 --> 02:01:12,115
I mean, I couldn't do what he does.

1870
02:01:12,195 --> 02:01:13,595
I couldn't organize people like him.

1871
02:01:14,136 --> 02:01:15,437
And we need him in this city.

1872
02:01:16,197 --> 02:01:19,419
The house itself, to me, just isn't a big priority.

1873
02:01:19,479 --> 02:01:24,182
But the green space, the Middlesex Fells, he's on all of those boards and committees, and we need him.

1874
02:01:24,222 --> 02:01:26,023
So I don't want to – it's not against him.

1875
02:01:26,143 --> 02:01:26,764
He's a great guy.

1876
02:01:27,344 --> 02:01:34,609
But it's that house doesn't serve a purpose where, you know, we have the auditorium that should be up and running.

1877
02:01:34,889 --> 02:01:36,570
We have other things that need to be up and running.

1878
02:01:36,970 --> 02:01:39,212
I'm sorry, because I know that it's just going to hold it over the 90,000.

1879
02:01:39,292 --> 02:01:41,253
It's just going to hold it over.

1880
02:01:41,633 --> 02:01:47,497
And if you guys don't act, the police building will be a historic building by the time you guys get a new one.

1881
02:01:48,738 --> 02:01:50,519
So I know I'm being sarcastic there.

1882
02:01:50,899 --> 02:01:53,181
But it's not personal.

1883
02:01:54,001 --> 02:01:56,603

02:06:31,384 --> 02:06:34,207
I had the opportunity to sit down and speak with Mr. Lawson a little bit earlier.

1948

I just have a couple of questions.

1950
02:06:44,916 --> 02:06:46,337
How long do you think this project is going to take?

1951
02:06:47,318 --> 02:06:50,659
Well, as soon as we pick the permit, we have to notify DigSafe.

DigSafe has 72 hours to respond.

1953
02:06:53,460 --> 02:06:56,001

Both of them next week?

1955

Yes.

1956
02:06:57,161 --> 02:07:00,042
And how long from start to finish do you think it will take once you break the ground over?

1957
02:07:00,082 --> 02:07:03,943
One governor's hour is probably a day, and Salem Street is probably three days.

1958
02:07:04,183 --> 02:07:04,403
Excellent.

1959
02:07:04,423 --> 02:07:06,184

This property actually is, Evelina's is opening up, Evelina's a restaurant in Medford, it's been around for a long, long time.

1977
02:08:12,560 --> 02:08:14,502
Right next door, they're gonna open up a function room.

1978
02:08:15,282 --> 02:08:22,768
And the property's actually set back quite a bit from the streets, so they need the signage to be just a little bit bigger to be seen.

1979
02:08:23,149 --> 02:08:31,796
You can actually see in your picture, there's a green awning on the left-hand side of the picture, and the words are so small, you really can't even see it so well.

1980
02:08:32,336 --> 02:08:34,018
into, in this drawing here.

1981
02:08:34,198 --> 02:08:38,281
So that's the petition just to allow the sign to exist as drawn.

Uh, this seems to be a simple request of, uh, an awning.

1986
02:08:56,911 --> 02:09:04,834
This, as the gentleman mentioned, Avelinos has been a long established business in our community with a fantastic reputation.

02:11:58,341 --> 02:12:03,904
So it'll be a five yes and two no.

2052
02:12:03,964 --> 02:12:04,844
License has been granted.

2053
02:12:06,165 --> 02:12:06,825
Happy driving.

2054
02:12:08,386 --> 02:12:08,946
Happy driving.

2055
02:12:08,966 --> 02:12:10,487
Thank you.

2056
02:12:11,607 --> 02:12:12,628
I'm sorry, six of us.

2057
02:12:12,648 --> 02:12:12,768
6-1, 6-2.

2058
02:12:12,848 --> 02:12:15,429
I'm sorry, 4-2.

2059
02:12:15,469 --> 02:12:15,909
Happy driving.

2060
02:12:27,855 --> 02:12:29,396
Thank you.

2061
02:12:29,456 --> 02:12:30,137
Thank you.

2062
02:12:30,357 --> 02:12:37,742
14, 741, petition, taxi apparatus by Nicholas Fritz, 42 Rock Valley Ave, Everett, driving for Citywide Taxi, 40 Canal Street, Medford.

2063
02:12:38,242 --> 02:12:40,044
Is Mr. Fritz in the audience?

2064
02:12:40,884 --> 02:12:41,585
He has gone home.

2065
02:12:43,866 --> 02:12:44,947
Please lay that on the table.

2066
02:12:46,488 --> 02:12:47,269
Lay that on the table.

2067
02:12:47,289 --> 02:12:48,710
All right, what do we got left here?

2068
02:12:58,328 --> 02:13:01,289
Okay, if we can revert back to regular business.

2069
02:13:06,130 --> 02:13:26,597
Okay, we have... 14, 735, offered by Councilor Pentland, be it resolved that the Christmas nativity scene be returned to its Royal House Park location for the Christmas

2070
02:13:27,467 --> 02:13:28,488
New Year season.

2071
02:13:28,828 --> 02:13:29,428
Counselor Penta.

2072
02:13:29,568 --> 02:13:37,953
Mr. President, I've been asked by many people, and I forgot to do this last year, so I'm doing it this year, well in advance.

2073
02:13:38,754 --> 02:13:57,025
And as a result of what's been going on throughout this entire country of ours, between atheists and people of non-Christian Judeo faith slamming the Christmas season, wanting to take Christ out of Christmas, and just absolutely have an atheistic type of an attitude as it relates to

2074
02:13:57,593 --> 02:14:00,554
you know, what this country should be rather than what it really is.

2075
02:14:00,574 --> 02:14:22,620
I think we as a city need to step up to the plate and let people know that we are a Christian-Judeo community, born on the principles of a country that was founded on that religious belief, and not be subject to threats or intimidation from folks who are either atheistic or are not our religious persuasions.

2076
02:14:23,301 --> 02:14:24,601
At the same time, Mr. President,

2077
02:14:26,082 --> 02:14:36,644
I think, you know, when we have our Christmas holiday season, and I think it's next week we're going to be having, or two weeks from now, we're going to be having a Christmas bonanza here out in City Hall.

2078
02:14:36,704 --> 02:14:49,667
You're going to have Santa Claus, which is Saint Nicholas, which stems from some type of religious connotation from being a saint, I believe, from Scotland, dating back to when this whole situation started.

2079
02:14:50,787 --> 02:14:55,648
Why should we be subject or letting ourselves as a community be subject to anything

2080
02:14:56,190 --> 02:14:57,851
by way of threat or intimidation.

2081
02:14:57,891 --> 02:15:01,013
I think we should just stand tall, put the nativity scene back.

2082
02:15:01,053 --> 02:15:03,395
If nobody wants to honor it, so be it.

2083
02:15:03,735 --> 02:15:05,296
But it's part of our American heritage.

2084
02:15:05,697 --> 02:15:07,438
It's part of our city of Medford's heritage.

2085
02:15:08,218 --> 02:15:13,222
And to start letting go of these things slowly but surely, it makes no sense.

2086
02:15:14,022 --> 02:15:19,887
I don't know if any of you folks read it, but there was an article written by a pilot from American Airlines.

2087
02:15:20,827 --> 02:15:22,769
And he also was a pilot that flew

2088
02:15:25,387 --> 02:15:33,729
flew on the day of September 11th, when we were attacked crazily by a group of fanatical Muslims, Arab Muslims.

2089
02:15:34,609 --> 02:15:40,330
And he writes a very interesting story, as was presented in the news media.

2090
02:15:41,070 --> 02:15:42,510
He has seen all kinds of people.

2091
02:15:42,550 --> 02:15:44,271
He has flown all kinds of people.

2092
02:15:45,391 --> 02:15:52,592
And he has no problem with all kinds of people that have been flying and coming into this country, whether they legally, as immigrants.

2093
02:15:53,713 --> 02:15:54,833
But those that are here,

2094
02:15:55,657 --> 02:16:04,382
have a responsibility to stand up for people of their nations, not of American, that are destroying us.

2095
02:16:04,442 --> 02:16:12,286
And I think a couple of weeks ago on 60 Minutes, there was a story relative toward the Islamic jihadist.

2096
02:16:12,686 --> 02:16:16,408
This is after, I think, the third American was killed or beheaded.

2097
02:16:17,529 --> 02:16:23,912
And basically saying, we're going to get the Americans, and we're going to get the French, because those are the two that he singled out, and we're going

2098
02:16:24,368 --> 02:16:27,671
make you become under our way, and we will behead you if we have to.

2099
02:16:28,972 --> 02:16:32,815
Those type of people of that particular faith are living in this country.

2100
02:16:32,855 --> 02:16:37,059
And I think they have a responsibility to stand up and saying that they are not part of it.

2101
02:16:37,499 --> 02:16:40,682
They need to stand up and say, you know, we are good Muslims.

2102
02:16:40,962 --> 02:16:44,425
We have come here to this country, and we have subscribed to the American way of living.

2103
02:16:44,805 --> 02:16:47,047
And part of our American way of living is our holidays.

2104
02:16:48,348 --> 02:16:53,433
Now, you have in Maryland, you have one parent who is an atheist.

2105
02:16:54,126 --> 02:17:07,494
who has now stopped all the holiday season in the Maryland school district only because of the reason that they're an atheist and they don't want their child to be subject to the Judeo-Christian way of having a Christmas.

2106
02:17:08,275 --> 02:17:17,280
So what the school system did in Maryland, what they did is they got rid of all connotations and any names relative toward the Christmas season

2107
02:17:17,791 --> 02:17:18,912
and just calling it a holiday.

2108
02:17:18,952 --> 02:17:21,653
Well, what kind of a holiday is it, if anybody can explain it?

2109
02:17:22,334 --> 02:17:24,835
The holiday has always been representative of Christmas.

2110
02:17:25,396 --> 02:17:28,858
And it's always been tolerant of the Judeo-Christian background.

2111
02:17:29,318 --> 02:17:37,383
And I think it's been tolerant of every other type of religion that this country has allowed to have their expressions of freedom of peace and freedom of speech.

2112
02:17:38,324 --> 02:17:43,287
But to turn around and take away something that's a main staple of this country is wrong.

2113
02:17:43,327 --> 02:17:44,688
And people need to start speaking up.

2114
02:17:45,331 --> 02:17:54,078
And news media needs to start speaking up and not going along and coddling those people who just plainly are indifferent to our American way of living.

2115
02:17:54,298 --> 02:17:56,380
If they don't like our American way, then move out.

2116
02:17:56,520 --> 02:17:57,080
Get out of here.

2117
02:17:57,521 --> 02:17:59,062
Why does everybody want to come to this country?

2118
02:17:59,642 --> 02:18:00,983
They come here to get their welfare.

2119
02:18:01,344 --> 02:18:02,785
They come here to get their housing.

2120
02:18:03,085 --> 02:18:05,106
They come here to get their illegal driver's license.

2121
02:18:05,787 --> 02:18:13,413
And they come here to get sometimes an illegal education at the expense of those people who pay for it, whose families have paid for it, who have earned it through the years.

2122
02:18:14,322 --> 02:18:22,366
So all I'm saying, Mr. President, and anyone who might be watching — and I don't know if the news media is here — Christmas is a very happy time of the year.

2123
02:18:22,966 --> 02:18:25,267
Sure, to some folks, it has a sacred connotation.

2124
02:18:25,567 --> 02:18:28,668
And if you don't want to accept it, you don't have to buy into it or believe it.

2125
02:18:29,509 --> 02:18:33,110
But don't be so stupid enough to get rid of it because we're offending somebody.

2126
02:18:33,350 --> 02:18:36,432
What about the people that they're offending by asking us to get rid of it?

2127
02:18:36,452 --> 02:18:38,493
That doesn't make any sense.

2128
02:18:39,353 --> 02:18:41,334
And no kid and no child should be died

2129
02:18:41,910 --> 02:18:44,312
what Christmas, what the New Year's is, what St.

2130
02:18:44,352 --> 02:18:49,095
Nicholas is all about, and what their religious holiday is during this time of the year.

2131
02:18:49,575 --> 02:18:54,919
If not, then we should just abolish holidays and just not have a Christmas or a holiday season.

2132
02:18:55,899 --> 02:18:57,120
It had to be there for some reason.

2133
02:18:57,841 --> 02:19:00,963
It's a multi-million dollar market for corporate America.

2134
02:19:02,106 --> 02:19:06,368
For games, for toys, for clothes, just put on the television and you'll see it.

2135
02:19:06,629 --> 02:19:07,709
And you'll see Santa Claus.

2136
02:19:08,250 --> 02:19:13,553
And I'll tell you one thing, I give credit to the people who are advertising now on television, they're using the word Merry Christmas.

2137
02:19:14,533 --> 02:19:16,734
They're using the word Merry Christmas, and that's the way it should be.

2138
02:19:17,235 --> 02:19:19,076
It is a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.

2139
02:19:19,696 --> 02:19:22,017
And I'll repeat, if you don't like it, then move out.

2140
02:19:22,558 --> 02:19:31,443
And I would hope that this city does nothing, does nothing to follow suit of some of these other cities and some of these other towns who are being challenged

2141
02:19:32,093 --> 02:19:36,075
by folks who are so indifferent to our American way of living.

2142
02:19:36,095 --> 02:19:48,481
So I move the question, Mr. President, and ask that the mayor put for this holiday, Christmas season, for the Christmas, New Year's, the nativity scene that sits at that Royal House Park as it did for so many years.

2143
02:19:49,242 --> 02:19:50,122
Thank you, Councilor Pinto.

2144
02:19:50,442 --> 02:19:50,963
Councilor Knight.

2145
02:19:52,043 --> 02:19:53,404
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

2146
02:19:53,424 --> 02:19:55,685
I think it would be important to point out that

2147
02:19:56,293 --> 02:19:59,934
I think it was three years ago the nativity scene was removed from Royal House Park.

2148
02:20:00,594 --> 02:20:10,195
And the reason that the nativity scene was removed from Royal House Park was because people kept stealing the caricatures that were there with the nativity scene.

2149
02:20:10,655 --> 02:20:24,218
So I think it's very important that if we are going to in fact have the nativity scene put back out that we also ask the residents in our good city to respect it and to leave it alone and to leave baby Jesus in the manger and to leave the three wise men in their position.

2150
02:20:24,238 --> 02:20:25,078
Point well taken.

2151
02:20:25,488 --> 02:20:27,209
you know, providing their gifts, Mr. President.

2152
02:20:27,469 --> 02:20:27,770
Thank you.

2153
02:20:27,810 --> 02:20:28,470
Point well taken.

2154
02:20:29,051 --> 02:20:30,071
Counselor De La Rosa.

2155
02:20:30,832 --> 02:20:41,840
Maybe we could amend this, Mr. President, to ask the members of the American Civil Liberties Union to fund the security measures to keep the crash in place.

2156
02:20:42,881 --> 02:20:49,966
Thank you, Counselor De La Rosa.

2157
02:20:50,446 --> 02:20:51,407
Name and address of the record.

2158
02:20:51,447 --> 02:20:52,768
Jean Martin, 10 Cummings Street.

2159
02:20:54,412 --> 02:20:57,514
I'd just like to say, touchy subject, folks.

2160
02:20:58,274 --> 02:21:00,035
And I have neighbors.

2161
02:21:00,075 --> 02:21:01,556
I live in a two-family neighborhood.

2162
02:21:02,176 --> 02:21:04,057
And so we have a lot of immigrants in my neighborhood.

2163
02:21:04,377 --> 02:21:05,298
I have a lot of Asians.

2164
02:21:05,758 --> 02:21:09,480
I have Buddhists, and I have Muslim neighbors.

2165
02:21:09,820 --> 02:21:17,604
And I'd just like to speak up for them for a minute and to say that I was invited to their Buddhist wedding and their breakfast ceremony.

2166
02:21:17,824 --> 02:21:21,206
And so it's a different way of life.

2167
02:21:22,988 --> 02:21:25,111
But it's not a bad thing.

2168
02:21:25,151 --> 02:21:33,322
The other thing is that I don't know, all I know is that I helped my Arab neighbor with her car and

2169
02:21:34,199 --> 02:21:36,860
At Christmastime, she gave me a gift.

2170
02:21:37,661 --> 02:21:52,548
Now, we don't know if she is here because she was a translator in Iraq or Afghanistan, put her life on the line, and her family put her life on the line to come into this country because they translated for the U.S.

2171
02:21:52,808 --> 02:21:53,108
troops.

2172
02:21:53,589 --> 02:21:54,549
So we don't know.

2173
02:21:54,949 --> 02:21:56,990
I know this is a touchy, touchy subject.

2174
02:21:58,131 --> 02:22:00,172
I'm a Christian, and I respect that.

2175
02:22:00,515 --> 02:22:07,360
And any private property in this city can have the biggest glaring crash on the planet.

2176
02:22:08,061 --> 02:22:12,465
It is when the government sponsors the crash that it becomes an issue.

2177
02:22:13,025 --> 02:22:13,826
And it becomes an issue.

2178
02:22:13,886 --> 02:22:17,108
And Catholics were discriminated against when they came here from the Protestants.

2179
02:22:17,649 --> 02:22:19,430
The Jews were discriminated against.

2180
02:22:20,751 --> 02:22:29,218
Every, every, there were Protestant denominations that were hung, women that were hung on the common because they weren't Puritans.

2181
02:22:29,887 --> 02:22:33,209
So this tradition is something.

2182
02:22:33,669 --> 02:22:35,150
But I don't want to get into all of that.

2183
02:22:35,250 --> 02:22:41,254
I do want to say that I have neighbors that come from different religious backgrounds that aren't Christian or Jewish.

2184
02:22:41,994 --> 02:22:45,396
And the city is changing demographically.

2185
02:22:46,017 --> 02:22:48,478
So I'd say keep it religiously neutral.

2186
02:22:48,778 --> 02:22:50,039
But if you have private property,

2187
02:22:50,900 --> 02:22:55,025
You can put the biggest cross on your—oh, that sounded terrible.

2188
02:22:55,345 --> 02:23:00,631
You can put a crucifix any place you want, and you can put a crush any place you want.

2189
02:23:00,731 --> 02:23:02,793
And you can put as many lights and trees as you want.

2190
02:23:02,853 --> 02:23:05,336
In fact, the tree seems to be a neutral thing.

2191
02:23:06,317 --> 02:23:10,281
But I just—I don't want to be, you know,

2192
02:23:11,758 --> 02:23:20,720
I just have to say that because it's terrible because we do miss out on our childhood memories of Christmas and school and holidays and Easter eggs.

2193
02:23:20,760 --> 02:23:29,403
And some of those traditions have been taken out of the schools, which is kind of sad for the kids because they can't do what they used to do, but they're going to have to come up with new traditions.

2194
02:23:30,263 --> 02:23:31,303
That's just the way it is today.

2195
02:23:31,764 --> 02:23:32,044
Thank you.

2196
02:23:32,064 --> 02:23:32,664
Thank you.

2197
02:23:33,304 --> 02:23:40,646
Counselor Penta, uh, Jeannie, you know, our country was founded on two specific beliefs, um, numb freedom of speech and freedom of religion.

2198
02:23:41,492 --> 02:23:45,754
And the doors to the Supreme Court of the United States, you know what they have on them?

2199
02:23:46,554 --> 02:23:47,774
Yes, the Ten Commandments.

2200
02:23:47,875 --> 02:23:48,675
They have the Ten Commandments.

2201
02:23:48,695 --> 02:23:49,235
That is correct.

2202
02:23:49,295 --> 02:23:50,796
And when you go to court, what do you do?

2203
02:23:50,836 --> 02:23:52,376
You put your hand on the Bible to tell the truth.

2204
02:23:52,656 --> 02:23:52,956
That's true.

2205
02:23:52,976 --> 02:23:53,197
Correct?

2206
02:23:53,237 --> 02:23:54,297
You don't have to today, though.

2207
02:23:54,717 --> 02:23:55,217
You can say I affirm.

2208
02:23:55,237 --> 02:23:56,678
But you know something?

2209
02:23:56,838 --> 02:23:58,318
I believe, so I don't have a problem.

2210
02:23:58,338 --> 02:23:58,899
OK, so you believe.

2211
02:23:58,919 --> 02:23:59,879
But you can say I affirm.

2212
02:24:00,339 --> 02:24:03,901
And you just indicated, and you alluded to the fact that your neighbor gave you a Christmas gift.

2213
02:24:03,961 --> 02:24:10,143
And whether it's responsive to something maybe that you did, or she's just honoring you because this is what we do here in this country.

2214
02:24:10,544 --> 02:24:11,064
then so be it.

2215
02:24:11,204 --> 02:24:12,205
But I'm not talking about her.

2216
02:24:12,585 --> 02:24:17,188
I'm talking about the crazies that are out there, the people that don't like us, don't like our country.

2217
02:24:17,909 --> 02:24:23,412
I'm talking about the people that are extremely irrational and don't and won't accept our American way of living.

2218
02:24:23,633 --> 02:24:33,619
But they're here in this country and they're doing everything in their power while they're here in this country to lessen the freedoms and everything that we've enjoyed, as you just indicated as a child growing up.

2219
02:24:34,440 --> 02:24:39,283
And I don't think there's anything wrong with the nativity scene, just like I don't think there's anything wrong with having a Christmas party out there.

2220
02:24:40,180 --> 02:24:42,682
But if you're not going to have the nativity scene, then don't have St.

2221
02:24:42,702 --> 02:24:45,843
Nicholas, because there's a religious connotation that goes with it.

2222
02:24:45,863 --> 02:24:47,244
So what are you going to tell the kids?

2223
02:24:47,565 --> 02:24:49,306
Oh, it's just a winter holiday.

2224
02:24:49,726 --> 02:24:54,709
You can come out here and we'll have hot dogs and donuts and popcorn, but we're Santa Claus.

2225
02:24:55,369 --> 02:25:00,472
What are you going to tell all these kids, three, four, five, six, and seven, eight years old, or whenever they believe and they don't believe?

2226
02:25:00,492 --> 02:25:01,833
What are you going to tell the parents?

2227
02:25:02,894 --> 02:25:06,156
This is part of our American tradition and our heritage.

2228
02:25:07,129 --> 02:25:08,950
And this is not saying it's religious.

2229
02:25:09,670 --> 02:25:12,772
If you don't want to buy into it or believe in it, you don't have to.

2230
02:25:13,492 --> 02:25:17,394
Nobody is stopping anyone else from having their type of religious holiday.

2231
02:25:17,914 --> 02:25:29,560
But when someone tries to destroy ours, either by being an atheist or being someone from a foreign country who just doesn't believe in our way of living, and they're hearing this country, then get out of here.

2232
02:25:29,800 --> 02:25:30,780
If you don't like it, go.

2233
02:25:31,300 --> 02:25:32,581
Nobody's telling you to stay here.

2234
02:25:33,261 --> 02:25:34,542
But they must seem to like it enough.

2235
02:25:35,022 --> 02:25:36,323
They must give enough perks.

2236
02:25:37,426 --> 02:25:38,807
OK, to get what they want.

2237
02:25:39,187 --> 02:25:39,947
I'm not backing off.

2238
02:25:39,987 --> 02:25:42,829
I'm going to ask for a roll call vote on this, because I think this is very important.

2239
02:25:43,089 --> 02:25:44,930
It's been part of the city of Medford's history.

2240
02:25:45,210 --> 02:25:48,832
And if you read the history of the city of Medford, it's in that book, Lock, Stock, and Barrel.

2241
02:25:49,372 --> 02:25:49,932
Oh, one second.

2242
02:25:50,333 --> 02:25:53,294
I'd just like to say, commercialism has stolen Christmas.

2243
02:25:53,874 --> 02:25:54,575
I agree with you there.

2244
02:25:55,455 --> 02:25:55,795
Thank you.

2245
02:25:57,436 --> 02:25:58,177
President Camuso.

2246
02:25:58,697 --> 02:26:00,018
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

2247
02:26:00,178 --> 02:26:04,840
And I encourage all of Medford people

2248
02:26:05,753 --> 02:26:10,815
to continue believing what they believe in, their spirituality, their religion.

2249
02:26:12,616 --> 02:26:16,297
And quite honestly, that's what our community is built upon.

2250
02:26:16,337 --> 02:26:21,639
It's the diversity of all the different faiths and all the different denominations throughout the community.

2251
02:26:22,779 --> 02:26:26,901
You know, we have schools in this community that children are speaking 10, 15 different languages.

2252
02:26:29,382 --> 02:26:34,664
I think we have to be inclusive and we have to continue sending a message that the city of Medford,

2253
02:26:35,655 --> 02:26:41,517
We are proud of our heritage, but we are also very inclusive of all denominations and all religions.

2254
02:26:42,238 --> 02:26:47,960
And quite honestly, I don't think it's our job as a city council to take a stance one way or another on this particular matter.

2255
02:26:48,900 --> 02:26:49,220
Thank you.

2256
02:26:50,081 --> 02:26:51,301
Thank you, President Camuso.

2257
02:26:52,502 --> 02:26:58,384
Uh, we have a motion on the floor to send, uh, Councilor Pinter's, uh, motion to the mayor.

2258
02:26:59,284 --> 02:27:00,585
Roll call board has been requested.

2259
02:27:04,707 --> 02:27:06,969
Yes, we do.

2260
02:27:08,210 --> 02:27:17,757
Well, if we have one, we'll make sure we'll get it out there.

2261
02:27:17,837 --> 02:27:21,580
Roll call vote has been requested by Councilor Benta.

2262
02:27:34,110 --> 02:27:34,890
President Camuso.

2263
02:27:35,391 --> 02:27:35,591
No.

2264
02:27:37,172 --> 02:27:38,012
Councilor Dela Rousseau.

2265
02:27:38,372 --> 02:27:38,632
Yes.

2266
02:27:39,893 --> 02:27:40,513
Councilor Night.

2267
02:27:40,613 --> 02:27:40,833
Yes.

2268
02:27:41,394 --> 02:27:42,194
Councilor Kern.

2269
02:27:42,254 --> 02:27:42,374
Yes.

2270
02:27:42,874 --> 02:27:43,555
Councilor Montz.

2271
02:27:43,915 --> 02:27:44,175
Yes.

2272
02:27:44,675 --> 02:27:45,356
Councilor Penta.

2273
02:27:45,396 --> 02:27:45,596
Yes.

2274
02:27:46,136 --> 02:27:47,036
Vice President Cabrillo.

2275
02:27:47,397 --> 02:27:50,278
Yes.

2276
02:27:51,078 --> 02:27:52,879
Motion of 6-1, the motion carries.

2277
02:27:53,780 --> 02:27:54,020
All right.

2278
02:27:56,833 --> 02:28:00,996
Motion for suspension to take items number 14-739 and 14-741.

2279
02:28:01,096 --> 02:28:05,659
Taxi operator license.

2280
02:28:05,699 --> 02:28:09,881
The petition is submitted.

2281
02:28:10,482 --> 02:28:10,902
Okay.

2282
02:28:12,083 --> 02:28:15,665
Suspension has been requested by Councilor Dela Russo.

2283
02:28:15,685 --> 02:28:20,428
14-739, petition for taxi operator license by Ismael A. Hussan.

2284
02:28:22,893 --> 02:28:24,854
157 Pleasant Street, Malden, Mass.

2285
02:28:24,874 --> 02:28:27,295
Driving from Mass Cab, 121 Rea.

2286
02:28:28,015 --> 02:28:28,655
Medford, Mass.

2287
02:28:28,695 --> 02:28:29,455
Is he in the audience?

2288
02:28:29,575 --> 02:28:30,476
Name and address for the record.

2289
02:28:34,477 --> 02:28:35,157
My name is Smail.

2290
02:28:35,177 --> 02:28:36,077
Let me see.

2291
02:28:37,418 --> 02:28:40,119
President Camuso, have you reviewed his application?

2292
02:28:41,539 --> 02:28:43,180
Thank you.

2293
02:28:43,980 --> 02:28:45,841
Motion for approval by Councilor Del Rosso.

2294
02:28:46,781 --> 02:28:47,321
All in favor?

2295
02:28:50,782 --> 02:28:52,223
I will mark Councilor Marks.

2296
02:28:53,550 --> 02:28:56,172
is in the opposition, and Councilor Pinto is in the opposition.

2297
02:28:57,173 --> 02:28:58,254
And the same reason as before.

2298
02:28:58,774 --> 02:29:01,276
So motion passes 5-2.

2299
02:29:02,517 --> 02:29:03,117
Happy driving.

2300
02:29:03,838 --> 02:29:04,238
Thank you.

2301
02:29:04,258 --> 02:29:09,682
Thank you so much.

2302
02:29:09,762 --> 02:29:10,783
Was that 7-4-4-1?

2303
02:29:10,843 --> 02:29:10,983
Yes.

2304
02:29:12,544 --> 02:29:12,985
OK.

2305
02:29:13,005 --> 02:29:17,048
14-7-4-1, petition for taxi driver license by Nicholas Fritz.

2306
02:29:17,068 --> 02:29:19,669
44 Rock Valley Avenue, Everett, Mass.

2307
02:29:19,689 --> 02:29:21,071
Driving for Citywide Taxi.

2308
02:29:21,811 --> 02:29:23,012
40 Canal Street, Medford.

2309
02:29:24,048 --> 02:29:26,109
President Camuso, have you reviewed the gentleman's records?

2310
02:29:27,629 --> 02:29:28,930
My name is Fritz Nicholas.

2311
02:29:28,950 --> 02:29:33,372
I live in 42 York Valley Avenue in St.

2312
02:29:33,392 --> 02:29:36,853
Stanton in nine years, so eight years, eight months.

2313
02:29:38,014 --> 02:29:41,995
So I would like to drive for CityWalk Taxi and make further.

2314
02:29:42,155 --> 02:29:43,076
Thank you.

2315
02:29:44,516 --> 02:29:46,437
Motion by Councilor Tarullo for approval.

2316
02:29:49,963 --> 02:29:53,706
If you can record Councilor Marks and Councilor Pinto in the opposition.

2317
02:29:53,726 --> 02:29:56,327
Is there anybody from before?

2318
02:29:57,348 --> 02:29:57,848
All in favor?

2319
02:29:57,868 --> 02:29:57,928
Aye.

2320
02:29:58,849 --> 02:29:59,549
Motion passes 5-2.

2321
02:29:59,569 --> 02:30:03,452
Okay, if we can revert back to regular business now.

2322
02:30:05,193 --> 02:30:06,113
While we're under suspension.

2323
02:30:08,315 --> 02:30:12,697
If we can revert back to regular business, 14-736 for Vice President Caraviello.

2324
02:30:15,540 --> 02:30:24,744
being resolved, the city council offered consolations to the family of Chris Travis, who passed away last week after his long battle with ALS.

2325
02:30:26,325 --> 02:30:34,589
Chris was a good member of this community, a high school athlete, a good man on the soccer field, talking to a good family.

2326
02:30:38,471 --> 02:30:44,394
He suffered for many years, the last four years, and I see him every week, never once complained about

2327
02:30:45,263 --> 02:30:49,326
So ALS is a terrible way to pass away.

2328
02:30:50,227 --> 02:30:58,573
We have several others, so if we could do one moment of silence and I'll read them all off.

2329
02:30:58,673 --> 02:31:06,058
14, 745 offered by Vice President Caraviello, be it resolved that the City Council offer condolences to the family of Frederick W Roach, who passed away last week.

2330
02:31:06,198 --> 02:31:13,644
Mr. Roach was a World War II veteran and a former City of Memphis employee with the Water and Sewer Departments.

2331
02:31:17,248 --> 02:31:28,276
14, 747, offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the City Council offer its deep and sincere condolences to the family of Bernie McGovern on his recent passing.

2332
02:31:30,077 --> 02:31:38,442
Offered by Councilor Locks, be it resolved that a moment of silence be held for the long time ever resident, John Murphy, on his recent passing.

2333
02:31:46,743 --> 02:31:47,383
Councilor Marks.

2334
02:31:49,044 --> 02:31:50,044
Thank you, Mr. President.

2335
02:31:50,404 --> 02:31:54,545
I just want to speak briefly on the passing of Mr. John Murphy.

2336
02:31:55,625 --> 02:32:06,068
For any of us that know Mr. Murphy, he was a family man, a husband, a father, a grandfather, a very active parishioner at St.

2337
02:32:06,088 --> 02:32:07,408
Joseph's Parish.

2338
02:32:07,929 --> 02:32:12,550
He also was a worker at Verizon for 44 years.

2339
02:32:14,782 --> 02:32:22,427
And he will be sorely missed by his three children and six grandchildren and many residents of this community.

2340
02:32:23,848 --> 02:32:39,660
Here is a man, Mr. President, that has always put his family first and, after retirement, had some health concerns and never really bothered anyone, kept it to himself, as you mentioned, Mr. President.

2341
02:32:42,102 --> 02:32:49,807
you know, for several years, um, fought diligently, uh, and succumb to his illness.

2342
02:32:50,487 --> 02:32:55,070
And I wish the family well, uh, along with the children and the grandchildren.

2343
02:32:55,750 --> 02:32:56,991
And he will be sorely missed.

2344
02:32:57,011 --> 02:32:57,632
Mr. President.

2345
02:32:58,092 --> 02:32:58,412
Thank you.

2346
02:32:58,452 --> 02:32:59,112
Councilor Marks.

2347
02:32:59,953 --> 02:33:02,975
Key 14, seven, four, eight offered by Councilor Knight.

2348
02:33:03,555 --> 02:33:07,998
He resolved that the Memphis City Council extended deep and sincere condolences

2349
02:33:08,587 --> 02:33:12,071
to the family of Vincenza Sincardi on her recent passing.

2350
02:33:14,694 --> 02:33:23,223
Offered by Councilor Dela Russo, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council offer sincere condolences to the family of Deborah Gaglione, who passed away this past week.

2351
02:33:23,703 --> 02:33:25,105
She was a long-time Memphis resident.

2352
02:33:25,385 --> 02:33:29,550
If we could all stand for a moment of silence for all these fine residents of our city of Medford.

2353
02:33:45,296 --> 02:34:04,481
Office 14, 746 offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the City Engineer move forward to the Memphis City Council a copy of the regulations and standards for restoring governing road work and repairs thereof.

2354
02:34:04,581 --> 02:34:05,201
Councilor Knight.

2355
02:34:06,741 --> 02:34:08,062
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

2356
02:34:08,162 --> 02:34:13,823
I bring this resolution forward after driving down the streets of Medford and seeing a lot of work being done by private contractors.

2357
02:34:14,608 --> 02:34:18,810
by sitting here and approving a number of permit requests for private contractors to go and tear up our streets.

2358
02:34:19,370 --> 02:34:31,755
If we read item one underneath the city engineer's comments on a number of these requests for petitions for permits, it will say that the roadways are going to be restored back to city of Medford standards based on the rules and regulations that are in place.

2359
02:34:32,135 --> 02:34:40,058
Mr. President, I'd like the council to have a copy of those so we can hold these contractors accountable so that when they put the ground back in place and they pack up their tools and that they leave,

2360
02:34:40,525 --> 02:34:44,546
that they're leaving the city in pristine condition just like they were when they found it.

2361
02:34:45,147 --> 02:34:45,447
Thank you.

2362
02:34:45,487 --> 02:34:45,827
Counselor.

2363
02:34:45,847 --> 02:35:03,092
Nice motion to send those papers to the city engineer, the Florida Montrose offered by counselor Camuso be a resolved that the DPW replaced the old slow children's sign at 24 Walter street in the interest of public safety.

2364
02:35:04,153 --> 02:35:04,873
President Camuso,

2365
02:35:05,398 --> 02:35:05,738
Thank you.

2366
02:35:05,778 --> 02:35:10,759
This sign that's currently there is, um, very old and it's a popular neighborhood with a lot of children.

2367
02:35:10,859 --> 02:35:21,181
So if they could replace the sign, um, even if it's after the first of the year, most of approval, send it on and have it replaced.

2368
02:35:21,201 --> 02:35:26,923
Okay.

2369
02:35:26,943 --> 02:35:33,484
14 7 4 2 petition by Jovi Joseph big learning, 59 Garfield Avenue, Medford to address the council.

2370
02:35:34,025 --> 02:35:34,946
on reverse 9-1-1 fees.

2371
02:35:35,046 --> 02:35:37,708
Name and address for the record, please.

2372
02:35:37,909 --> 02:35:38,249
Thank you.

2373
02:35:38,309 --> 02:35:38,689
Good evening.

2374
02:35:38,890 --> 02:35:44,054
My name is Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Avenue, Medford, Mass.

2375
02:35:45,576 --> 02:35:57,627
When some citizens receive the system we call reverse notification, formerly reverse 9-1-1, it is an important emergency system from City Hall, with good work from Captain Barry Clemente of the Medford Police Department.

2376
02:35:58,783 --> 02:36:06,970
Our excellent budget director, who was here earlier, informed me that we pay about 39K a year, with 20,000 of that annually coming from a grant.

2377
02:36:07,050 --> 02:36:11,153
Now that's good news, because we're paying, maybe the taxpayers are paying about 19,000.

2378
02:36:12,574 --> 02:36:17,378
My request to all elected officials, starting with the city council, is twofold.

2379
02:36:18,979 --> 02:36:26,425
One, to enhance this system that we have, and number two, to keep it to emergency calls only.

2380
02:36:27,698 --> 02:36:32,439
There are a lot of messages coming from City Hall which are not of an emergency nature.

2381
02:36:33,279 --> 02:36:46,962
And what that does is if you're dashing across the room to grab the phone and you're hearing about something that isn't a snow blizzard coming, or even an election, and I consider an election a very important item that should be on reverse notification.

2382
02:36:48,202 --> 02:36:53,043
If it's something else, there are other ways of getting that information out to the public.

2383
02:36:54,948 --> 02:37:06,477
And combining the other options is going to enhance reverse notification and make it more effective and put non-emergency items where they belong.

2384
02:37:07,398 --> 02:37:20,228
Now, for example, Captain Clemente could have a show on the high school and government channels and on public access where City Hall can have its issues that are coming over this reverse notification system.

2385
02:37:21,150 --> 02:37:35,666
on television, we can have a low-power AM radio station, we can have an online radio station, we can contact Inside Medford, the Medford Transcript, the Medford Mercury, and whatever's left of this on theboston.com.

2386
02:37:35,706 --> 02:37:40,271
But all of the sites that are out there, combine everything, have everything as an emergency

2387
02:37:42,237 --> 02:37:46,519
system in one area and another area, information from City Hall.

2388
02:37:46,559 --> 02:37:52,421
Now, one of the councilors brought up the police chief Sacco being on Channel 7 on Friday night.

2389
02:37:53,541 --> 02:38:00,104
My sports host advised me of that and I went online and on Channel 7 you can see the discussion is right there.

2390
02:38:00,264 --> 02:38:06,086
If you go to the Channel 7 website and put in Medford and you will see what aired on Friday night last week.

2391
02:38:07,972 --> 02:38:10,193
People were getting tickets last year.

2392
02:38:10,953 --> 02:38:13,415
Not enough people are aware of the street sweeping.

2393
02:38:14,355 --> 02:38:15,256
Very important issue.

2394
02:38:15,916 --> 02:38:35,886
So if we had a number of other entities out there, not just this reverse notification system, but other ways of getting it out there, the government channel, the educational channel, Captain Clemente having a show, word of mouth, just getting the word out there, people won't be parking their cars and interfering with street sweeping.

2395
02:38:37,358 --> 02:38:38,339
Again, it's twofold.

2396
02:38:38,679 --> 02:38:39,380
It's very simple.

2397
02:38:40,180 --> 02:38:41,802
I want to enhance the system we have.

2398
02:38:41,942 --> 02:38:43,243
We're paying a lot of money for it.

2399
02:38:43,864 --> 02:39:00,297
And by combining the monies that we have for public access that we're not using, let's open an access station and work with the captain to get this information out there and make sure that as many people in this community as possible are getting this information and to keep reverse notification for emergency calls only.

2400
02:39:01,138 --> 02:39:01,478
Thank you.

2401
02:39:03,860 --> 02:39:04,601
Councillor Penta.

2402
02:39:05,001 --> 02:39:05,922
I'd like to ask you a question.

2403
02:39:06,822 --> 02:39:14,245
It's obvious that you put an awful lot of time into it, and you're very positive as it relates to public access and stuff like that.

2404
02:39:14,926 --> 02:39:17,227
But something came across my desk, and I don't know if it's true or false.

2405
02:39:17,267 --> 02:39:18,387
I don't know if anyone's aware of this.

2406
02:39:18,908 --> 02:39:32,454
I think it's of the city of Detroit, I could be wrong, or if it's a city in California, but one of those two, where the community had brought an action, a class action, against the administrator of the city for not having public access.

2407
02:39:32,474 --> 02:39:33,074
Have you heard about that?

2408
02:39:33,525 --> 02:39:35,086
There are two different cities I'm aware of.

2409
02:39:35,146 --> 02:39:36,106
California, yes.

2410
02:39:36,446 --> 02:39:39,928
And in Philadelphia, 19 years without access.

2411
02:39:39,968 --> 02:39:45,371
Now, every major city in America has access, except for Philadelphia, about 10 years ago.

2412
02:39:45,491 --> 02:39:50,234
So the citizens got together, and they did fight to get access to TV.

2413
02:39:51,834 --> 02:39:53,855
So it's a similar situation in Medford.

2414
02:39:53,895 --> 02:39:55,396
For 19 years, they had no access.

2415
02:39:55,416 --> 02:39:58,798
So finally, the citizens, you know, worked on it.

2416
02:39:59,838 --> 02:40:00,779
And it's litigation.

2417
02:40:00,819 --> 02:40:02,940
That's the only way they can make things happen.

2418
02:40:03,367 --> 02:40:07,770
If I remember correctly, and this is way before you, Joe, this is taxing.

2419
02:40:08,171 --> 02:40:09,672
There's nobody on the council that would remember this.

2420
02:40:09,712 --> 02:40:21,881
I think it was 1982 or 1983 when we had a city manager form of government and we had signed the contract with Warner Cable, I believe it was Time Warner, whatever the name of the company was back then.

2421
02:40:22,401 --> 02:40:31,888
Then city manager, John Galloni, I believe, through Dan Riley, this is taxing my mind, Dan Riley, he was a city solicitor at the time.

2422
02:40:34,453 --> 02:40:45,837
A lack of better words, either challenged Time Warner or demanded from Time Warner because they lacked, I believe, the broadcasting, the clarity in the broadcasting.

2423
02:40:46,397 --> 02:40:51,318
There was an issue regarding, I believe, public access or city access here in the city of Medford.

2424
02:40:51,579 --> 02:40:53,659
There were four things that they went after at that point in time.

2425
02:40:54,079 --> 02:40:54,840
And they responded.

2426
02:40:55,840 --> 02:40:59,801
And I couldn't help but think, and I came across this the other day, and I should have brought the paper with me.

2427
02:41:00,421 --> 02:41:02,242
It was a memo that was sent out at that point in time.

2428
02:41:03,573 --> 02:41:08,415
What a difference back then, and this was in the early years of when cable was in the city of Medford.

2429
02:41:08,435 --> 02:41:10,016
I think there was no more than a year, year and a half.

2430
02:41:10,576 --> 02:41:14,157
The black and white shows were kind of like fuzzy and a whole bunch of other things that they put in there.

2431
02:41:16,058 --> 02:41:26,582
So different then as compared to what it is right now, how this city administration is handling the concerns of not only cable television, public access, but you have Comcast and you have Verizon here in the city of Medford.

2432
02:41:27,502 --> 02:41:30,223
And both of those stations that are supposed to be delivering

2433
02:41:31,426 --> 02:41:37,590
community access, public access, are charging people each and every week, each and every month on their bills, and they're getting nothing.

2434
02:41:37,690 --> 02:41:43,013
We have in excess of over $303,000, according to the city coffers, that the city is sitting on.

2435
02:41:43,714 --> 02:41:47,676
So right now, I believe the contract terminates in April of next year, 2015?

2436
02:41:49,317 --> 02:41:49,917
April 20th.

2437
02:41:50,217 --> 02:41:51,198
April 20th, okay.

2438
02:41:52,099 --> 02:41:57,882
And the way the contract was written in the last time, within six months prior to the ending of the contract,

2439
02:41:58,994 --> 02:42:00,415
public hearing needs to take place.

2440
02:42:00,475 --> 02:42:02,596
Now, I'm not aware of any public hearing taking place.

2441
02:42:03,077 --> 02:42:05,298
We've gotten no information regarding a public hearing.

2442
02:42:06,118 --> 02:42:08,820
We, there's a gentleman by the name, I think his name was Peter Epstein.

2443
02:42:08,860 --> 02:42:10,801
He gets paid $325 an hour.

2444
02:42:11,142 --> 02:42:12,222
He comes from the city of Newton.

2445
02:42:12,262 --> 02:42:15,284
He's the city's legal representative for cable access.

2446
02:42:16,285 --> 02:42:17,245
Absolutely nothing.

2447
02:42:17,706 --> 02:42:27,872
I put a call in once and I will, I will put another call in, but I just really think if the mayor of this community does not want to have public access, he needs to return the money and end it.

2448
02:42:28,255 --> 02:42:30,336
instead of having this facade take place.

2449
02:42:31,276 --> 02:42:33,898
We've gone through two experiments, so to speak.

2450
02:42:34,398 --> 02:42:38,560
One with a former Judge Jackson, we spent almost $15,000, where a report was written.

2451
02:42:38,940 --> 02:42:51,465
And then most recently, as of this past year, with three community members sitting together for three and a half, four months, and they put together a report for which the mayor said he would be reviewing that or getting into the gut of that after July 4th, and this is now November.

2452
02:42:51,986 --> 02:42:54,467
So it's obvious that something is going on.

2453
02:42:54,507 --> 02:42:56,628
The city just doesn't want to participate

2454
02:42:57,767 --> 02:43:00,688
Maybe the mayor just thinks he can take that money and use it, and maybe he can't.

2455
02:43:00,748 --> 02:43:01,148
I don't know.

2456
02:43:01,628 --> 02:43:03,909
But, Councilman Marks, you made a remark two weeks ago.

2457
02:43:04,649 --> 02:43:09,251
Maybe it's about time that we bring a class action suit in behalf of the ratepayers of this community.

2458
02:43:10,331 --> 02:43:11,031
I want to check in.

2459
02:43:11,071 --> 02:43:12,812
You said it was Detroit?

2460
02:43:12,852 --> 02:43:13,812
Detroit was another one.

2461
02:43:13,852 --> 02:43:17,273
Detroit was where the mayor sued the city council over access.

2462
02:43:17,533 --> 02:43:18,013
Over access.

2463
02:43:18,254 --> 02:43:18,474
Okay.

2464
02:43:18,494 --> 02:43:20,874
Yeah, the mayor sued the city council in Detroit over access.

2465
02:43:21,194 --> 02:43:21,775
I want to see that.

2466
02:43:21,795 --> 02:43:22,915
You said Philadelphia and Detroit.

2467
02:43:23,668 --> 02:43:25,769
Philadelphia and California are the class action suits.

2468
02:43:25,789 --> 02:43:26,089
Okay.

2469
02:43:26,209 --> 02:43:34,333
If that's the case, and I think if there are enough, 10 people out there who are rate payers within this community who are willing to go forward, I think we need to do that.

2470
02:43:34,833 --> 02:43:35,473
This is crazy.

2471
02:43:35,914 --> 02:43:37,394
You keep coming here each and every week.

2472
02:43:37,434 --> 02:43:41,036
We talk amongst ourselves, we take these votes and the mayor is doing nothing about it.

2473
02:43:41,596 --> 02:43:44,417
So if he's not going to do anything about it, maybe Councilor Marks, you're right.

2474
02:43:44,477 --> 02:43:50,880
Maybe we just need to take this upon ourselves, you know, file a class action suit and let's just see where we're going with this because

2475
02:43:51,356 --> 02:43:52,177
This can't keep going.

2476
02:43:52,217 --> 02:43:53,137
You can't keep doing this.

2477
02:43:53,598 --> 02:43:56,580
You can't keep charging the ratepayers and giving them nothing.

2478
02:43:56,820 --> 02:43:58,722
This isn't like only three or four or five or six months.

2479
02:43:59,002 --> 02:44:00,143
This goes back to December of 2012.

2480
02:44:00,183 --> 02:44:03,745
This is not making any sense.

2481
02:44:04,026 --> 02:44:05,727
So I thank you for bringing forward that.

2482
02:44:05,767 --> 02:44:07,568
But I knew there was something out there.

2483
02:44:08,309 --> 02:44:12,312
But now you're saying the mayor sues the council, and then we have one where the council sues the mayor.

2484
02:44:12,512 --> 02:44:12,752
In Detroit.

2485
02:44:13,513 --> 02:44:13,613
OK.

2486
02:44:13,733 --> 02:44:15,314
And I'm ready to litigate in January.

2487
02:44:15,354 --> 02:44:16,935
But I'd much rather a class action suit.

2488
02:44:17,015 --> 02:44:18,196
But I am in discussion with lawyers.

2489
02:44:18,236 --> 02:44:20,698
And my game plan, and I think Mr. Rumley knows it,

2490
02:44:21,011 --> 02:44:22,252
By January, nothing happens.

2491
02:44:22,432 --> 02:44:23,713
I will be personally litigating.

2492
02:44:23,933 --> 02:44:25,895
I'd much rather a class action suit.

2493
02:44:25,915 --> 02:44:41,067
Well, we have something, I believe, on our agenda at the very end that goes back to July of last year, waiting for Mr. Rumley to give us an update, because I believe at that point in time, he gave us a full document of what Channel 3 and its corporate offices were all about, what they were supposed to do.

2494
02:44:41,367 --> 02:44:44,689
They were supposed to file the appropriate papers with the, I believe, the Attorney General's office.

2495
02:44:44,709 --> 02:44:47,532
I don't know about the Secretary of State, but I know the Attorney General.

2496
02:44:48,112 --> 02:44:49,233
So maybe we should get an update.

2497
02:44:49,594 --> 02:44:51,094
Maybe we should get an update, Mr. Clerk.

2498
02:44:51,394 --> 02:44:52,115
Maybe we should get an update.

2499
02:44:52,395 --> 02:45:01,317
Have Mr. Rumley present himself before the council as it relates to just where does the city stand on its lawsuit and where does the city stand on renewing the contract?

2500
02:45:04,838 --> 02:45:08,979
And again, the reverse notification I think is essential in its public safety.

2501
02:45:09,039 --> 02:45:10,400
And I thank the council for hearing me.

2502
02:45:15,341 --> 02:45:15,481
Records.

2503
02:45:15,501 --> 02:45:15,661
Records.

2504
02:45:15,681 --> 02:45:16,181
You can take a vote.

2505
02:45:16,921 --> 02:45:17,682
Take a vote on that.

2506
02:45:20,667 --> 02:45:22,287
No, I have a motion on the floor.

2507
02:45:24,488 --> 02:45:25,128
You're not listening.

2508
02:45:25,308 --> 02:45:35,911
To have the city solicitor report back to the council since July of this past year, what further information he has or what further has the city progressed?

2509
02:45:36,451 --> 02:45:43,293
And second of all, what is our standing relative to the cable contract, which comes up April 20th?

2510
02:45:43,793 --> 02:45:44,333
What are we doing?

2511
02:45:50,263 --> 02:45:51,024
All those in favor?

2512
02:45:51,124 --> 02:45:51,764
Roll call vote.

2513
02:45:52,505 --> 02:45:53,585
Roll call has been requested.

2514
02:45:55,887 --> 02:45:56,807
Vice President Caviello?

2515
02:45:56,827 --> 02:45:57,008
Yes.

2516
02:45:57,708 --> 02:45:58,489
Councilor DelaRusso?

2517
02:45:58,509 --> 02:45:58,669
Yes.

2518
02:45:58,989 --> 02:45:59,429
Councilor Knight?

2519
02:45:59,449 --> 02:45:59,569
Yes.

2520
02:46:02,331 --> 02:46:03,012
Councilor McKernan?

2521
02:46:03,052 --> 02:46:03,252
Yes.

2522
02:46:03,732 --> 02:46:04,292
Councilor Marks?

2523
02:46:04,533 --> 02:46:04,793
Yes.

2524
02:46:04,973 --> 02:46:05,413
Councilor Panza?

2525
02:46:05,473 --> 02:46:05,733
Yes.

2526
02:46:06,194 --> 02:46:06,854
President Camuso?

2527
02:46:07,214 --> 02:46:07,455
No.

2528
02:46:08,175 --> 02:46:09,956
Six in the affirmative, one in the negative.

2529
02:46:10,417 --> 02:46:11,317
The motion passes.

2530
02:46:14,019 --> 02:46:17,001
And on the motion, revert back to the regular order of business.

2531
02:46:17,061 --> 02:46:17,782
All those in favor?

2532
02:46:18,322 --> 02:46:19,122
All those opposed?

2533
02:46:20,562 --> 02:46:23,844
Item 14-737, offered by Vice President Caraviello.

2534
02:46:24,424 --> 02:46:29,066
Be it resolved that the city council discuss the upcoming tree planting by the city of Medford.

2535
02:46:29,526 --> 02:46:30,607
Vice President Caraviello.

2536
02:46:30,767 --> 02:46:31,547
Thank you, Mr. President.

2537
02:46:31,827 --> 02:46:42,752
I don't know if many people know, but right currently the city is in the process of trying to replant over 100 trees to hopefully replace some of the trees we lost over the past winter.

2538
02:46:43,513 --> 02:46:48,975
So if you look around, there's about five or six different species of trees being planted, different parts of the community.

2539
02:46:49,355 --> 02:46:58,238
And I also want to thank the business members of the community who participated in our tree program, where for every tree that was bought, the city matched the tree.

2540
02:46:58,878 --> 02:47:03,080
So I say if you keep an eye out, you'll see them, and it's not too late if you give her a call.

2541
02:47:04,040 --> 02:47:05,181
There may be a few trees left.

2542
02:47:06,241 --> 02:47:06,841
Thank you.

2543
02:47:06,861 --> 02:47:07,822
Thank you for the announcement.

2544
02:47:08,042 --> 02:47:09,022
What do you want to do with it?

2545
02:47:09,122 --> 02:47:09,882
Receive and place on file?

2546
02:47:10,002 --> 02:47:10,843
Receive and place on file.

2547
02:47:10,883 --> 02:47:13,924
On the motion of Vice President to receive and place on file, all those in favor?

2548
02:47:14,624 --> 02:47:15,244
All those opposed?

2549
02:47:15,264 --> 02:47:15,865
The ayes have it.

2550
02:47:16,105 --> 02:47:16,665
The records.

2551
02:47:18,010 --> 02:47:18,530
Councilor Pinto.

2552
02:47:18,690 --> 02:47:23,913
We had made a request a couple of weeks ago as it relates to the Curtis tough school.

2553
02:47:23,933 --> 02:47:25,514
We'd asked for a response to come back.

2554
02:47:26,214 --> 02:47:30,156
We never got the response back, but what we did get was a newspaper story.

2555
02:47:30,236 --> 02:47:33,218
Once again, this council has to read things in the newspaper.

2556
02:47:33,838 --> 02:47:45,704
And unfortunately, um, council marks, I believe for the last two to three budgetary cycles had been asking about the Curtis tough school, what's going on over there and some of the concerns that were taking place.

2557
02:47:46,723 --> 02:47:59,028
And then we read in the news article, nicely written, that superintendent of schools said that he has noticed in recent years that there has been a program leveling off.

2558
02:47:59,368 --> 02:48:08,472
And it also indicates that we began to think that the Curtis had developed such a regiment that it really wasn't adapting particularly well to the change in the students' needs.

2559
02:48:09,333 --> 02:48:14,915
We began to feel in the last several years we were not getting the kind of mix and coherence between the program

2560
02:48:15,489 --> 02:48:16,750
and the people coming down there.

2561
02:48:17,290 --> 02:48:26,375
Now, when you say, between the last several years, and Councilman Knox has been asking, and it's been brought up during our budgetary process, what's going on?

2562
02:48:26,515 --> 02:48:30,338
All we were getting for a report back was, well, we're working on it.

2563
02:48:30,358 --> 02:48:33,759
There's some problems, and they're addressing it.

2564
02:48:34,320 --> 02:48:40,463
And then they hired an outside consultant in 2013 called the Walker Partnership Company.

2565
02:48:41,324 --> 02:48:45,066
And their report included 14 recommendations to correct the problems.

2566
02:48:45,648 --> 02:48:51,092
of high absenteeism, lack of administrative oversight, and other predominant issues.

2567
02:48:51,912 --> 02:48:56,835
But the big shakeup came during the summer for which this council was never apprised of.

2568
02:48:57,376 --> 02:49:07,862
It was never apprised during the budgetary process in June and in July when they went forward and they replaced Mr. Volpe as the headmaster at that particular school.

2569
02:49:08,943 --> 02:49:12,445
And they replaced him with a gentleman by the name of Mr. Toomey.

2570
02:49:13,746 --> 02:49:14,687
Now the question is,

2571
02:49:16,573 --> 02:49:19,354
You're paying for one principal to be over there.

2572
02:49:20,875 --> 02:49:28,918
But you found another job up at the high school for Mr. Volpe.

2573
02:49:29,058 --> 02:49:30,198
And that's what we asked for.

2574
02:49:30,798 --> 02:49:31,759
What is this job?

2575
02:49:32,399 --> 02:49:33,459
What's he getting paid?

2576
02:49:34,060 --> 02:49:38,921
And what's the pay of the gentleman that now took over his job at the school?

2577
02:49:40,082 --> 02:49:41,222
This doesn't make any sense.

2578
02:49:43,443 --> 02:49:51,709
make some changes, and you know that the council had an interest in it, and it's part of our budget responsibility when we vote on the school department side, it should have been forthcoming.

2579
02:49:52,670 --> 02:49:54,991
We shouldn't have to once again read something in the newspaper.

2580
02:49:55,712 --> 02:49:59,714
And I commend you again for doing a great job, Alex, for writing the story.

2581
02:50:00,275 --> 02:50:01,816
But Alex isn't the administration.

2582
02:50:01,916 --> 02:50:02,817
He's a news reporter.

2583
02:50:04,157 --> 02:50:12,003
We make resolutions and ask for responses, and every time we either ask for a response or want to know what's going on, you have to read the newspaper.

2584
02:50:13,375 --> 02:50:27,684
This administration, on both sides of the street, is just completely ignorant to the fact that there needs to be a cooperation, there needs to be a conversation, there needs to be some sense that what's going on makes sense.

2585
02:50:28,025 --> 02:50:31,867
Not just makes sense for him, the mayor, it makes sense for the council.

2586
02:50:32,247 --> 02:50:36,630
Perfect example, you just got through voting tonight for in excess of a million three hundred thousand.

2587
02:50:37,051 --> 02:50:40,733
Not one council, I'll speak for myself, I don't think any one council was asked

2588
02:50:41,030 --> 02:50:47,278
for any particular pet project they might have that could have been included in there.

2589
02:50:47,839 --> 02:50:57,211
I believe that every week we send resolutions forward to the mayor asking him to do certain things that we'd like to see done, which I think would serve as a benchmark.

2590
02:50:58,083 --> 02:51:06,805
or an understanding as to where the council is coming from, what type of initiatives that they'd like to see done, what direction that they'd like to see the mayor's office move in, in terms of this type of expenditures.

2591
02:51:06,845 --> 02:51:08,045
We'll look at LED lights.

2592
02:51:08,085 --> 02:51:09,566
That's something that the council put forward.

2593
02:51:09,866 --> 02:51:10,966
We look at security cameras.

2594
02:51:10,986 --> 02:51:12,306
That's something the council has put forward.

2595
02:51:12,326 --> 02:51:14,287
We've looked at the issue of crosswalks and speed bumps.

2596
02:51:14,307 --> 02:51:15,547
That's something the council has put forward.

2597
02:51:16,087 --> 02:51:18,007
So I just wanted to make sure that we're all clear about that.

2598
02:51:18,027 --> 02:51:19,128
Mr. President, I rest.

2599
02:51:19,348 --> 02:51:21,668
And to be further clear about it, Councilor Knight, I'm glad you brought it up.

2600
02:51:21,708 --> 02:51:23,989
Look at the length of time before this action was taking place.

2601
02:51:24,689 --> 02:51:24,809
So,

2602
02:51:25,960 --> 02:51:28,902
Some of these issues have been years in the making, never mind weeks or months.

2603
02:51:29,542 --> 02:51:32,204
But I just think it's kind of like interesting.

2604
02:51:32,424 --> 02:51:44,493
And once again, Mr. Clark, you have the res—I'm going to move the resolution again, that we get a report back as to Mr. Brian Toomey, who's the new principal at the Curtis Tufts School, what's his pay?

2605
02:51:45,413 --> 02:51:49,416
And also, Mr. Volpe, who's up at the high school, what's his job and what's his pay?

2606
02:51:52,161 --> 02:51:53,082
This is all municipal.

2607
02:51:53,462 --> 02:51:54,562
It's all municipal business.

2608
02:51:55,123 --> 02:51:58,265
And this is something that the council has been asking about for years.

2609
02:51:58,465 --> 02:52:00,746
You've been asking council Max for years on this.

2610
02:52:04,428 --> 02:52:04,749
God.

2611
02:52:06,230 --> 02:52:07,050
All those in favor.

2612
02:52:07,110 --> 02:52:07,731
Roll call vote.

2613
02:52:07,751 --> 02:52:11,513
Mr. President, what's the matter before us and what is the actual resolution?

2614
02:52:12,533 --> 02:52:18,837
The resolution is to have, what is Mr. Brian to be the new minister, the new principal at the Tufts Curtis school?

2615
02:52:19,238 --> 02:52:19,978
What's the salary?

2616
02:52:20,425 --> 02:52:24,886
And Mr. Volpe, who's there no longer, who's up at the high school, what's his job and what's his salary?

2617
02:52:24,906 --> 02:52:27,306
Isn't this the same resolution we just sent forward a couple weeks ago?

2618
02:52:27,767 --> 02:52:31,527
We never got an answer, did we?

2619
02:52:31,807 --> 02:52:35,508
It was referred to the superintendent schools from the mayor's office, I'm assuming.

2620
02:52:35,548 --> 02:52:39,569
You can refer it to the school committee if you want.

2621
02:52:41,729 --> 02:52:42,330
Counselor Marks.

2622
02:52:43,750 --> 02:52:44,630
Thank you, Mr. President.

2623
02:52:45,678 --> 02:53:02,663
As we're probably all aware, and maybe some of us aren't, Curtis Tufts was created many years ago to suit a need in the community for students that, for one reason or another, weren't able to attend the high school in that particular setting.

2624
02:53:03,104 --> 02:53:13,727
Some of it was for learning reasons, some of it was for discipline reasons, and the alternative high school, which is Curtis Tufts, was created for Method students.

2625
02:53:14,267 --> 02:53:18,528
and allowed them to move forward to eventually get their diploma.

2626
02:53:19,188 --> 02:53:23,990
And over the years, if you want to track it, it's out there.

2627
02:53:24,950 --> 02:53:29,711
The number of students that are being serviced in that school has decreased.

2628
02:53:30,351 --> 02:53:34,393
And the number of Method students has been severely decreased.

2629
02:53:35,373 --> 02:53:39,674
And at this particular time, we're looking at a few dozen students.

2630
02:53:40,778 --> 02:53:43,679
and primarily from outside of this community.

2631
02:53:44,119 --> 02:54:06,867
Now, I realize there is a tuition that we gain from these outside communities, but as Councilor Penta mentioned, year after year I've been asking during the budget process that we should be taking a look at the per pupil expense and also compare it to the revenue we're receiving and see whether or not this particular program, which was all

2632
02:54:07,383 --> 02:54:15,949
good intentions when it started out is still suiting the purpose of ultimately what it's for, the students of this community.

2633
02:54:16,750 --> 02:54:26,197
And I would say if that no longer is taking place, then the school committee and the administration have to take a long hard look at this particular program.

2634
02:54:26,777 --> 02:54:29,239
I've also mentioned over the years, because as we all know,

2635
02:54:29,726 --> 02:54:33,187
The high school was built to house some 3,000 students.

2636
02:54:34,487 --> 02:54:37,508
It's probably a third of the capacity right now.

2637
02:54:38,908 --> 02:54:45,210
And it was mentioned that maybe we could use portions of the high school for this particular program.

2638
02:54:45,510 --> 02:54:47,790
Because now you're maintaining a separate building.

2639
02:54:48,150 --> 02:54:52,411
You're maintaining heat, electricity, physical maintenance of the property.

2640
02:54:52,751 --> 02:54:59,273
Last year we had asbestos tiles removed in the building at a great expense.

2641
02:54:59,971 --> 02:55:02,853
And these are the things I think we have to explore.

2642
02:55:03,594 --> 02:55:09,919
And I think what Councilor Penta alluded to tonight, the changing of the guard, if you want to call it.

2643
02:55:09,959 --> 02:55:14,742
Mr. Volpe was up there for a number of years as the head of the Curtis Tufts.

2644
02:55:15,483 --> 02:55:19,646
I think speaks volumes at what's going on with that program.

2645
02:55:20,286 --> 02:55:24,569
And I think really the need for the program needs to be explored.

2646
02:55:24,930 --> 02:55:29,293
I'm not against students that may have certain problems and need additional help.

2647
02:55:29,737 --> 02:55:30,598
I think that's great.

2648
02:55:30,978 --> 02:55:36,702
I've attended their graduation in the past, and I think they do great things there.

2649
02:55:37,222 --> 02:55:47,169
But I think, like all programs, this needs to be explored to see if it's still financially beneficial for students and for the taxpayers of this community.

2650
02:55:47,750 --> 02:55:59,258
And I hope to get back that information as well, Mr. President, on the per-pupil expense and the current revenue that's being generated from outside placements.

2651
02:56:00,055 --> 02:56:04,979
If my council colleague wouldn't mind, I'd like to amend his paper to include those figures also.

2652
02:56:05,860 --> 02:56:07,381
And hopefully we'll get an answer.

2653
02:56:07,421 --> 02:56:10,884
I know you didn't get an answer a couple of weeks ago, but hopefully we'll get an answer on this paper.

2654
02:56:12,665 --> 02:56:14,367
Roll call has been requested as amended.

2655
02:56:27,758 --> 02:56:28,819
Vice President Caviello.

2656
02:56:28,859 --> 02:56:29,019
Yes.

2657
02:56:30,264 --> 02:56:31,104
Councilor Dela Rousseau?

2658
02:56:31,404 --> 02:56:31,604
No.

2659
02:56:32,525 --> 02:56:33,105
Councilor Knight?

2660
02:56:33,205 --> 02:56:33,405
No.

2661
02:56:34,145 --> 02:56:34,945
Councilor Alan Kern?

2662
02:56:34,985 --> 02:56:35,186
Yes.

2663
02:56:36,966 --> 02:56:37,626
