31
00:02:08,557 --> 00:02:09,138
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure thing.

32
00:02:09,218 --> 00:02:12,921
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, I guess out of this group, only a few of you may remember me.

33
00:02:12,981 --> 00:02:14,022
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Amanda Centrella.

34
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:24,091
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm, uh, uh, open space planner for the city of Medford planning development and sustainability office, but I used to, um, staff this board and I'm visiting tonight.

35
00:02:24,171 --> 00:02:27,574
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause, uh, Danielle is, is, um, out of the office this week.

36
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:33,179
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, also with us is Alicia Hunt, the director of planning development and sustainability.

37
00:02:35,723 --> 00:02:36,684
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Amanda.

38
00:02:37,485 --> 00:02:40,088
[SPEAKER_09]: So great having you with join us again this evening.

39
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:49,859
[SPEAKER_09]: So our first item on the agenda is a site plan modification for 121 Riverside Avenue, which is my foot housing authority salt install building.

40
00:02:51,187 --> 00:03:07,436
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to ask the staff to make any introductory comments and just, I just want to just quickly put a thought out there for the public to let you know that all board members are open to participate in this item this evening since there's no requirements for them to have been on the previous decision.

41
00:03:08,217 --> 00:03:08,797
[SPEAKER_09]: Amanda.

42
00:03:10,378 --> 00:03:11,038
[SPEAKER_00]: Great, yeah.

43
00:03:12,828 --> 00:03:23,935
[SPEAKER_00]: For I think all of you here, this might not be an item that you've seen before, although this project actually came before the board in late 2022 and early 2023.

44
00:03:24,015 --> 00:03:30,018
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the board last met on this project to discuss 121 Riverside Ave, February 15, 2023, to approve a modification to the site plan.

45
00:03:41,525 --> 00:03:46,209
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is recorded on a set of minutes that I put in our meeting packet.

46
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:49,131
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't have expected you guys to see it.

47
00:03:49,371 --> 00:03:51,312
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, in the last hour, put it in there.

48
00:03:51,392 --> 00:03:56,176
[SPEAKER_00]: But in case you all want to refer to it over the course of this discussion, it's there.

49
00:03:56,196 --> 00:04:05,662
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time, the proponent, which was the Medford Housing Authority, explained that on their site plan, which was approved in January of 2023,

50
00:04:07,212 --> 00:04:12,876
[SPEAKER_00]: It showed parking spaces on land that was owned by the Mass Department of Transportation.

51
00:04:13,576 --> 00:04:19,259
[SPEAKER_00]: And that portion of land had historically been used for parking by the Housing Authority.

52
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:26,664
[SPEAKER_00]: The Housing Authority and MassDOT planned to have that land conveyed to the Housing Authority.

53
00:04:27,144 --> 00:04:33,148
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the time, it was shared to the board that the process would take several months to do.

54
00:04:34,025 --> 00:04:37,286
[SPEAKER_00]: but that there was a full intention to have that completed.

55
00:04:38,287 --> 00:04:55,933
[SPEAKER_00]: To retain the construction pricing that the housing authority had received for the project, the housing authority needed to fulfill zoning requirements, which is a requirement of 111 parking spaces, and secure site plan approval in order to close out the financing and advance the project.

56
00:04:56,853 --> 00:05:15,031
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the Housing Authority presented what is the current site plan, which was approved to the board, but specified, and this is detailed a bit more in the minutes, that it was their preference and intention to revert to the original site plan parking when the land conveyance was completed.

57
00:05:15,511 --> 00:05:19,893
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that is just a little bit of a summary that brings us to today.

58
00:05:19,913 --> 00:05:33,438
[SPEAKER_00]: And the housing authority, I'm sure, can speak with a little bit more detail as to what's being proposed, but wanted to offer that kind of background information.

59
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:37,300
[SPEAKER_00]: Alicia, is there anything else we should toss to the group?

60
00:05:39,461 --> 00:05:44,987
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that covers it just for the board members both Amanda and I were present at that.

61
00:05:46,328 --> 00:05:48,270
[SPEAKER_04]: So we are actually familiar with this.

62
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:54,496
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you have other questions throughout I suspect you will that maybe we can field if not the housing authority.

63
00:05:58,192 --> 00:05:58,412
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

64
00:05:58,592 --> 00:06:03,755
[SPEAKER_09]: And with that, I'm going to invite the House of Authority representative from the House of Authority to present.

65
00:06:03,835 --> 00:06:15,860
[SPEAKER_09]: And just please keep in mind that if you can please keep your presentation high level to give us the points as you've so greatly presented to us previously, just for the new board members.

66
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,962
[SPEAKER_09]: And if there's any additional questions, then we can open it up at the end.

67
00:06:24,213 --> 00:06:25,794
[SPEAKER_09]: Attorney Kilson, will that be you?

68
00:06:26,635 --> 00:06:29,417
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you please unmute, Attorney Kilson?

69
00:06:30,738 --> 00:06:31,579
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I unmuted myself.

70
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:32,600
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

71
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,482
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Chair McPherson.

72
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:40,827
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that Natalie Janssen, who's one of the development consultants for Medford, is going to lead this conversation.

73
00:06:40,887 --> 00:06:44,210
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Natalie, I'm going to send the mic over to you.

74
00:06:44,983 --> 00:06:47,485
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, Hannah and thank you everyone for having us again.

75
00:06:47,505 --> 00:06:51,169
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Natalie Hanson I'm with the Cambridge Housing Authority.

76
00:06:51,649 --> 00:06:57,574
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been working as development consultants with the Medford Housing Authority on the Sultan stall modernization.

77
00:06:58,655 --> 00:07:07,343
[SPEAKER_03]: So, thank you Amanda for the background I think that captured it really well we also provided a memo that went through some of the dates and some of the changes.

78
00:07:09,445 --> 00:07:15,707
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an 11-story high-rise owned by the Medford Housing Authority that is currently undergoing construction.

79
00:07:16,247 --> 00:07:20,929
[SPEAKER_03]: And as Amanda said, during that process, we've been working with the Mass.

80
00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:23,049
[SPEAKER_03]: Department of Transportation to get the land.

81
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:37,334
[SPEAKER_03]: MHA now holds the land that was previously owned by DOT, and therefore we can now finalize the parking plan, and that will essentially allow the project to move forward with site work.

82
00:07:38,434 --> 00:07:48,541
[SPEAKER_03]: So if it's all right with the chair, I can share my screen, which has the updated plan, and I can go just through some of the changes quickly.

83
00:07:48,561 --> 00:07:49,742
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, please.

84
00:07:50,883 --> 00:07:51,243
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

85
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:58,348
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to click share screen.

86
00:08:04,412 --> 00:08:04,652
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

87
00:08:06,883 --> 00:08:11,324
[SPEAKER_03]: So can you see my screen and does it include the site plan?

88
00:08:11,364 --> 00:08:11,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect.

89
00:08:12,204 --> 00:08:34,970
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we refer to the land that was owned by the DOT and is now held by the MHA, it is this little triangle over here, close to number one, as well as this, if you see my cursor going over it, where you have the area that's red and striped.

90
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:37,052
[SPEAKER_03]: That's another area.

91
00:08:37,352 --> 00:08:40,156
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's now under the control of the MHA.

92
00:08:41,237 --> 00:08:45,322
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the changes here are primarily related to the parking.

93
00:08:46,524 --> 00:08:51,009
[SPEAKER_03]: As Amanda mentioned, we're still providing the 111 required parking spaces.

94
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:57,873
[SPEAKER_03]: that are required under the zoning code for the building will have 222 units once it's completed.

95
00:08:57,893 --> 00:09:08,638
[SPEAKER_03]: It is affordable senior, it's affordable units for seniors, and also households with disabilities so the parking requirement is point five per unit.

96
00:09:09,578 --> 00:09:18,684
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so the project, uh, MHA self-install LLC, uh, which is the owner of the project, it will still have 111 parking spaces.

97
00:09:18,944 --> 00:09:21,966
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just kind of rearrange where those parking spaces are.

98
00:09:21,986 --> 00:09:27,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so I'm going to go through these changes here in order.

99
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:30,331
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, uh, this one's very small.

100
00:09:30,371 --> 00:09:32,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Number one, here's the generator.

101
00:09:32,513 --> 00:09:38,877
[SPEAKER_03]: We needed to slightly adjust the orientation of that in order to provide adequate spacing.

102
00:09:40,227 --> 00:09:40,507
[SPEAKER_00]: here.

103
00:09:40,527 --> 00:09:51,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Number two here we improved this area for circulation in order to make coming in and out of the parking lot safer.

104
00:09:52,863 --> 00:09:59,985
[SPEAKER_03]: where you see the threes, three here, three here, and three here, there used to be parallel parking spots here.

105
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:16,049
[SPEAKER_03]: So when MHA did not have control over the DOT land, we needed to make sure that all 111 parking spaces were on land that was owned by MHA and that would be ground lease to MHA Salton Stolicy.

106
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:19,749
[SPEAKER_03]: So we added in, I can just go back.

107
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:21,010
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sorry.

108
00:10:23,171 --> 00:10:35,040
[SPEAKER_03]: We added in parallel parking spots along here, but we feel that it will ease with circulation to not have parallel parking spots at those locations.

109
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:44,407
[SPEAKER_03]: And then where you see four, we improved the paving for residents who are walking to the building.

110
00:10:46,473 --> 00:11:01,327
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and then number five here, this is now on land that will be owned, is owned by the MHA and that will not be ground leased to the partnership that owns Saltonstall Apartments.

111
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:03,810
[SPEAKER_03]: Here what's happening is that

112
00:11:05,422 --> 00:11:24,293
[SPEAKER_03]: MHA is going to enter into a parking easement agreement to provide 22 parking spaces on this land that will be for the use of the Saltonstall apartment building in order to make sure that it has access to the 111 required residential parking spaces.

113
00:11:25,113 --> 00:11:34,856
[SPEAKER_03]: That in turn will allow these 27 parking spaces to be able to be used by the administrative office.

114
00:11:34,996 --> 00:11:47,340
[SPEAKER_03]: So for people not familiar with the building, where you see the admin entry and this little box here, this is the location of the MHA central office.

115
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:55,382
[SPEAKER_03]: And as part of the construction at Saltonstall Apartments, it's being modernized and also expanded.

116
00:11:55,402 --> 00:12:16,408
[SPEAKER_03]: So then all in all, on a combination of the MHA, the Saltonstall Apartments land, which is essentially land that's ground-leased by the MHA to the partnership that owns the Saltonstall Apartment buildings, plus the parking easement agreement here,

117
00:12:16,948 --> 00:12:35,162
[SPEAKER_03]: there will be 111 residential parking spaces for the use of salt install apartments plus the 27 administrative office spaces for the MHA and that is essentially a reflection of what is currently at the property.

118
00:12:36,103 --> 00:12:41,187
[SPEAKER_03]: MHA has their parking spaces for the administrative buildings located here.

119
00:12:41,207 --> 00:12:45,550
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was my

120
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,082
[SPEAKER_03]: overall summation of the changes.

121
00:12:49,862 --> 00:12:54,466
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy to go to show the old plan that was approved in February, if that's helpful.

122
00:12:54,486 --> 00:12:57,788
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, I'd be happy to take any questions.

123
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:02,531
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much, Miss Jensen.

124
00:13:02,671 --> 00:13:09,176
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I actually I don't have any questions at this point.

125
00:13:09,236 --> 00:13:14,040
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to open it up to the board before it is a public hearing and I do have to open it up for public hearing.

126
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:19,957
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to ask the board if there's any questions from anyone.

127
00:13:21,518 --> 00:13:22,999
[SPEAKER_09]: This would be your chance.

128
00:13:27,982 --> 00:13:29,103
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have any.

129
00:13:29,163 --> 00:13:34,686
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to say, I just want to comment on, I'm happy to see the removal of the parallel parking spaces.

130
00:13:34,726 --> 00:13:36,807
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that'll make the circulation a lot safer.

131
00:13:37,387 --> 00:13:43,851
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm glad you managed to get everything settled with Mass UT so you didn't have to use that design.

132
00:13:47,089 --> 00:14:01,713
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I was pretty going to say, pretty much going to say that towards the end, there's so many more beneficial aspects with having established site control, such as the adequate space to remove the parallel parking with the circulation and safer access regress.

133
00:14:01,813 --> 00:14:13,475
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you have, not only do you have the required parking spaces for their residents, but you have given additional 27 for MHA employees and staff.

134
00:14:13,855 --> 00:14:16,196
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that it's just way more beneficial and

135
00:14:16,733 --> 00:14:31,843
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm glad that you were able to establish site control and I'm going forward just just reminds the board that we definitely need to start to do a condition for modifications for these sorts of things so that the proponents do not have to come back going forward.

136
00:14:32,564 --> 00:14:34,445
[SPEAKER_09]: And what's saying that and seeing no other.

137
00:14:34,465 --> 00:14:34,785
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

138
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:47,314
[SPEAKER_10]: I had one, it might be a hypothetical that isn't worth discussing, but the area B for future potential development.

139
00:14:47,875 --> 00:15:03,882
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just curious if the design of this kind of parking lot and layout was sort of like future-proof to ideas that you guys had for that future use, or is it just kind of two separate things that we don't really, that weren't really sort of like considered together?

140
00:15:07,837 --> 00:15:21,084
[SPEAKER_03]: So one, we were very happy to get rid of the parallel parking spaces for safety reasons and also thinking about area B. So the hope is to be able to develop this and provide more housing.

141
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:25,506
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why it's not part of this overall plan.

142
00:15:26,186 --> 00:15:33,549
[SPEAKER_03]: But we had a couple of parking spots here where you have number three, that would have really made

143
00:15:35,343 --> 00:15:42,008
[SPEAKER_03]: area B essentially an island surrounded by parking spaces for another development.

144
00:15:42,629 --> 00:16:02,164
[SPEAKER_03]: And there might be some opportunities to, once we get to area B, you know, we look forward to working with the board and with the designer team for that to determine how to best provide parking there.

145
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:09,935
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much.

146
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:12,317
[SPEAKER_09]: Are there any other questions from the board?

147
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,481
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm going to open up for public comment.

148
00:16:22,021 --> 00:16:26,364
[SPEAKER_09]: Those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message Amanda in the comments.

149
00:16:26,724 --> 00:16:31,046
[SPEAKER_09]: You can also send an email to OCD at medford-ma.org.

150
00:16:31,406 --> 00:16:34,448
[SPEAKER_09]: Before providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record.

151
00:16:34,648 --> 00:16:35,188
[SPEAKER_09]: A reminder

152
00:16:35,628 --> 00:16:41,850
[SPEAKER_09]: to all meeting participants to please refrain from using the chat function to provide comments as it is not part of the public record.

153
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:49,191
[SPEAKER_09]: However, if a participant is having audio or other technical difficulties, this may be entered into the chat to alert myself and staff.

154
00:16:50,712 --> 00:16:55,813
[SPEAKER_09]: Amanda, can you please manage the public comment queue and read any previously sent emails or letters?

155
00:16:57,954 --> 00:16:58,454
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.

156
00:16:58,534 --> 00:17:01,614
[SPEAKER_00]: So no previously received comments or letters.

157
00:17:03,948 --> 00:17:13,715
[SPEAKER_00]: Just going to give folks a minute in case anyone's feeling shy, but I don't think I see any hands raised or comments indicating an interest in speaking.

158
00:17:13,735 --> 00:17:20,760
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, nothing so far.

159
00:17:24,783 --> 00:17:29,206
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to close the public comment period for this meeting.

160
00:17:31,257 --> 00:17:37,461
[SPEAKER_09]: And one of the questions that I originally had was just how the city stood on this.

161
00:17:37,561 --> 00:17:44,085
[SPEAKER_09]: And because it's reverting back to the original site plan, there were no concerns from the city or the transportation engineer at all.

162
00:17:44,826 --> 00:17:56,213
[SPEAKER_09]: So with that, if the board, if there's no other questions from the board, I will wait a second and then we can move to a motion to approve if there's no other questions from the board.

163
00:18:00,237 --> 00:18:00,497
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

164
00:18:00,937 --> 00:18:08,779
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing none, I will ask for a motion to approve the site plan modification for 121 Riverside Avenue, Myford Housing Authority, Salt and Stall Building.

165
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,340
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll make the motion.

166
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,460
[SPEAKER_09]: And may I have a second?

167
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,961
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll second.

168
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:16,721
[SPEAKER_09]: Roll call.

169
00:18:17,061 --> 00:18:18,322
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice Chair Emily Hederman?

170
00:18:19,222 --> 00:18:19,342
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

171
00:18:19,902 --> 00:18:20,582

[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

[SPEAKER_09]: Ari Fishman?

174
00:18:23,423 --> 00:18:23,563
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

175
00:18:23,923 --> 00:18:25,383
[SPEAKER_09]: Sabrina Alpino?

176
00:18:26,224 --> 00:18:26,344
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

177
00:18:26,884 --> 00:18:27,524
[SPEAKER_09]: Sally Akiki?

178
00:18:27,544 --> 00:18:27,604
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

179
00:18:29,138 --> 00:18:29,358
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

180
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:30,919
[SPEAKER_09]: Adam Behrens.

181
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:31,920
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

182
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:33,721
[SPEAKER_09]: Annie Strang.

183
00:18:34,821 --> 00:18:34,961
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

184
00:18:35,642 --> 00:18:37,123
[SPEAKER_09]: And myself, Jackie McPherson.

185
00:18:37,303 --> 00:18:37,723
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm an aye.

186
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:40,204
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much, Attorney Kilson, Ms.

187
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:44,507
[SPEAKER_09]: Jansen, Mrs. Cittarello, and everyone else.

188
00:18:44,547 --> 00:18:44,987
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

189
00:18:45,807 --> 00:18:46,508
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

190
00:18:46,568 --> 00:18:47,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Appreciate it.

191
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:47,468
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care.

192
00:18:47,508 --> 00:18:48,329
[SPEAKER_09]: Have a great evening.

193
00:18:48,689 --> 00:18:48,949
[SPEAKER_07]: You too.

194
00:18:48,989 --> 00:18:49,709
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

195
00:18:49,769 --> 00:18:50,690
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a good evening, everyone.

196
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,111
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice to see everyone.

197
00:18:57,443 --> 00:19:04,144
[SPEAKER_09]: The next item is approval of minutes, but as of now, there's no minutes to approve as they're not yet ready for us.

198
00:19:05,665 --> 00:19:20,028
[SPEAKER_09]: Then the third item would be zoning overhaul updates if Alicia or Amanda has any verbal updates that they want to share with us on zoning overhaul updates or Amanda, Alicia, at this point, if you want to fill the new members in on what that is.

199
00:19:21,904 --> 00:19:46,222
[SPEAKER_04]: sure i just i didn't prepare remarks but i do think that this is a good opportunity um to sort of give you guys an update um in a big picture way the city did a comprehensive plan um it is available online we did it in 2023 it was finished um we we do have copies here in the office if you're really tangible paper people um

200
00:19:47,055 --> 00:20:00,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Through that, we recognize that the zoning in the city of Medford both doesn't reflect what is actually built in the city of Medford and doesn't reflect what we would like to have in the city of Medford.

201
00:20:00,418 --> 00:20:04,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Many of the neighborhoods areas that we like are actually nonconforming.

202
00:20:05,099 --> 00:20:10,440
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of the areas that we like the least, that we feel need development,

203
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,083
[SPEAKER_04]: we really would like to see different zoning there before it's developed.

204
00:20:16,104 --> 00:20:18,947
[SPEAKER_04]: So along those lines, there's a number of things that have occurred.

205
00:20:19,628 --> 00:20:22,570
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll hear about the city council did a recodification.

206
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:27,735
[SPEAKER_04]: So they basically had a lawyer go through and clean up zoning and make things legal, et cetera.

207
00:20:28,636 --> 00:20:35,502
[SPEAKER_04]: And that actually introduced a number of changes that occurred actually before the comprehensive plan was done.

208
00:20:36,844 --> 00:20:50,744
[SPEAKER_04]: The city council decided that they would really like to undertake to change the zoning in Medford to reflect what people would like to see in the city of Medford based on what we heard through the comprehensive plan.

209
00:20:51,645 --> 00:21:03,137
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have in fact hired a consultant, and this consultant is hired jointly between our office and the city council, so the city council got budget and we have budget and we're each paying half.

210
00:21:03,657 --> 00:21:09,082
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we are working very collaboratively on this project.

211
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:13,690
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm actually meeting it once.

212
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:22,195
[SPEAKER_04]: So the city council is meeting twice a month on Wednesday evenings opposite these meetings to discuss this.

213
00:21:22,536 --> 00:21:26,978
[SPEAKER_04]: I encourage all of you to attend, to watch, to participate.

214
00:21:27,398 --> 00:21:28,459
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to.

215
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:34,503
[SPEAKER_04]: At the very least, check out the handouts that come with it because that'll give you a real feel for what's going on.

216
00:21:35,303 --> 00:21:43,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, the city council is actually excellent about putting their packets online now, um, which is a huge change from, you know, a year ago.

217
00:21:43,888 --> 00:21:47,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so you can get all the handouts for these things.

218
00:21:47,991 --> 00:21:50,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so that's meeting publicly.

219
00:21:50,472 --> 00:21:58,197
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, uh, Danielle and I are actually meeting with the consultants and sometimes other staff from our office, essentially every week.

220
00:21:58,597 --> 00:22:08,742
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of the city Councilors Councilor Collins is meeting with us, almost every week as well and Councilor bears, some of those meetings to prep for the public meetings.

221
00:22:09,422 --> 00:22:14,785
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's in fact a timeline that they posted that let me.

222
00:22:16,213 --> 00:22:23,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Give me 30 seconds and let me put this up because it is actually what is going to be discussed at each of the coming meetings.

223
00:22:23,998 --> 00:22:31,443
[SPEAKER_04]: It is part of a larger presentation that was done at the last meeting.

224
00:22:31,463 --> 00:22:35,825
[SPEAKER_09]: Alicia, they meet every two weeks on this?

225
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:37,006
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

226
00:22:37,667 --> 00:22:38,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

227
00:22:41,449 --> 00:22:44,191
[SPEAKER_04]: And so and in fact, it's intentionally scheduled to

228
00:22:45,022 --> 00:22:47,104
[SPEAKER_04]: be the opposite night.

229
00:22:47,204 --> 00:23:02,278
[SPEAKER_04]: So if this board meets, I can't even, in third, then the city council is meeting second and fourth, but we are not actually meeting next week.

230
00:23:04,462 --> 00:23:07,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope, that is not the, here we go.

231
00:23:08,265 --> 00:23:16,911
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to pull up just this one slide for you, and then we'll share it around.

232
00:23:17,752 --> 00:23:26,479
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually got this packet today in my email, so I didn't have it to even consider sending it to you before today.

233
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:32,013
[SPEAKER_04]: So the like, gee, Alicia, I would have liked to have had this weeks ago.

234
00:23:32,033 --> 00:23:32,754
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't have it.

235
00:23:33,574 --> 00:23:35,876
[SPEAKER_04]: Brand new, here we go.

236
00:23:39,639 --> 00:23:48,867
[SPEAKER_04]: So July 24th, we did a workshop with maps, looking at zoning, what's existing built environment currently.

237
00:23:49,548 --> 00:23:54,232
[SPEAKER_04]: This past week, we met about Mystic Ave and Salem Street specifically.

238
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:56,911
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I'll just go through this verbally.

239
00:23:57,272 --> 00:24:02,976
[SPEAKER_04]: September 11, we're going to talk about condo conversion, housing definitions, and incentive zoning.

240
00:24:04,137 --> 00:24:08,201
[SPEAKER_04]: September 25, we're going to focus on Medford Square and West Medford.

241
00:24:09,162 --> 00:24:12,965
[SPEAKER_04]: October 9, we're going to focus on ADUs and affordable housing.

242
00:24:14,115 --> 00:24:16,698
[SPEAKER_04]: October 23rd neighborhood centers.

243
00:24:16,718 --> 00:24:27,729
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's more like, you know, there's a little pocket over here and a little pocket over there of commercial, but they don't necessarily have names that the rest of the public knows.

244
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:36,058
[SPEAKER_04]: The 13th is citywide strat, November 13th citywide strategies and November 27th corridors and areas.

245
00:24:38,381 --> 00:24:40,766
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can send that out to you guys.

246
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:42,930
[SPEAKER_04]: This is actually part of the whole presentation.

247
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:47,339
[SPEAKER_04]: So last week when we talked about Mystic Ave and Salem Street.

248
00:24:47,955 --> 00:24:57,199
[SPEAKER_04]: So partially what I also want you to know is that we are getting a lot of development pressure on Mystic F and we're getting it in two forms.

249
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:03,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Auto-based uses that are being pushed out of Somerville and Cambridge think that that's the perfect auto mile.

250
00:25:04,482 --> 00:25:05,023
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't.

251
00:25:06,903 --> 00:25:12,326
[SPEAKER_04]: So like we had a car wash apply last week for a special permit.

252
00:25:13,187 --> 00:25:21,516
[SPEAKER_04]: And we, we actually just approved a car wash, like, six months ago in like on one of the back roads behind Mystic Ave.

253
00:25:26,301 --> 00:25:27,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that's an example.

254
00:25:28,783 --> 00:25:34,827
[SPEAKER_04]: We are also hearing from developers who are saying, wow, you've got some great stuff going on there with the Great American Beer Hall.

255
00:25:35,307 --> 00:25:46,654
[SPEAKER_04]: We would really love to do some ground floor commercial and a couple of floors of residential within walking distance of that because we think that's a hot area that we want to get in on the ground floor of.

256
00:25:48,583 --> 00:25:50,504
[SPEAKER_04]: So, and that is not allowed.

257
00:25:51,084 --> 00:26:00,751
[SPEAKER_04]: So, we want to make that kind of development allowable and our consultants who Emily was actually the project manager on the comprehensive plan.

258
00:26:01,432 --> 00:26:03,213
[SPEAKER_04]: She has some excellent ideas.

259
00:26:03,273 --> 00:26:03,994
[SPEAKER_04]: She and her team.

260
00:26:04,554 --> 00:26:11,982
[SPEAKER_04]: about how we can use zoning to make Mystic Ave a more accessible, green, walkable area.

261
00:26:12,662 --> 00:26:16,146
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that was some of what we talked about this last Wednesday night.

262
00:26:16,986 --> 00:26:21,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Because of the development, we are also seeing some development pressures on Salem Street.

263
00:26:22,752 --> 00:26:33,422
[SPEAKER_04]: and Salem Street, but in fact, it's not allowed to have commercial by zoning anywhere from Medford Square to just outside Haynes Square.

264
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:38,647
[SPEAKER_04]: So right about where Friore, Italy is, that's the start of where commercial is allowed.

265
00:26:39,168 --> 00:26:40,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Salem Street is all commercial.

266
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,090
[SPEAKER_04]: There's residential, but

267
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,381
[SPEAKER_04]: it's all non-conforming.

268
00:26:45,421 --> 00:26:55,105
[SPEAKER_04]: So if somebody actually wants to rebuild or do commercial ground floor with residential above, non-conforming, not allowed.

269
00:26:55,725 --> 00:27:01,348
[SPEAKER_04]: So those two, and you've seen some of these projects in the past year or the board has,

270
00:27:02,489 --> 00:27:05,073
[SPEAKER_04]: So we are focusing on those two corridors.

271
00:27:05,773 --> 00:27:17,048
[SPEAKER_04]: The council has actually asked the consultants if they could provide them with zoning language in September to review and refer to this board.

272
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:32,440
[SPEAKER_04]: So there is actually a really solid chance that you will be seeing zoning changes from the city council in September or early October for Mystic Ave and Salem Street.

273
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:44,945
[SPEAKER_04]: And so for those of you who are new, legally, it first goes to the council, they have to refer it to you, and then you make comments and suggestions and give it back to them.

274
00:27:46,611 --> 00:27:47,492
[SPEAKER_04]: then they adopt it.

275
00:27:48,513 --> 00:27:49,714
[SPEAKER_04]: So that will be coming.

276
00:27:49,734 --> 00:28:03,206
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm very excited to see that come, because it is so much easier to say to a developer, here's what's allowed and not allowed, than, well, that's allowed, but we don't really want it.

277
00:28:03,526 --> 00:28:04,887
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is what we do want.

278
00:28:05,027 --> 00:28:06,308
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not allowed.

279
00:28:06,749 --> 00:28:10,012
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just not the best kind of conversation to be having.

280
00:28:11,073 --> 00:28:20,384
[SPEAKER_04]: And when those cases go in front of the zoning board, they look at me and say, but if the city really wants it, why don't they change the zoning to reflect that?

281
00:28:22,346 --> 00:28:26,250
[SPEAKER_04]: So for everybody, including the new people.

282
00:28:27,203 --> 00:28:30,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Danielle and I are happy to talk about these offline.

283
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:33,305
[SPEAKER_04]: We are happy to talk about them individually.

284
00:28:33,805 --> 00:28:40,107
[SPEAKER_04]: In order to talk about this as a board, it has to be on your agenda, which is why we've started putting a standing item on the agenda.

285
00:28:40,528 --> 00:28:49,250
[SPEAKER_04]: But if any of you would like more information, would like to talk about it, if you have things you'd like to see changed in the zoning, we have a long list.

286
00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:50,111
[SPEAKER_04]: So the list is

287
00:28:50,891 --> 00:28:51,992
[SPEAKER_04]: very mishmash now.

288
00:28:52,052 --> 00:28:54,733
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've sent it over to the consultants to start working through it.

289
00:28:55,254 --> 00:29:01,518
[SPEAKER_04]: There is also a Gantt chart of all the different things that we need to deal with and when it's coming.

290
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:05,440
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm thinking that I should have a version of that I could send you.

291
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:17,847
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm going to tell you that this Gantt chart is of a scale that if you wanted to print it and read it, you actually have to print it on 3-foot by 4-foot paper because it's just that kind of like

292
00:29:19,108 --> 00:29:20,509
[SPEAKER_04]: so much on there.

293
00:29:21,829 --> 00:29:23,190
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of unwieldy.

294
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:30,292
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually think I, I think I have some two foot by three foot versions in my office, but they're not the most recent versions.

295
00:29:32,493 --> 00:29:33,914
[SPEAKER_04]: So, any questions?

296
00:29:34,694 --> 00:29:44,438
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to clarify that it's Emily Keatons, the land use consultant and not our fabulous Vice Chair Emily Hederman that the city's working with.

297
00:29:45,718 --> 00:29:51,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Emily Innes of Innes Associates, and she is rapidly growing.

298
00:29:51,022 --> 00:29:51,882
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll find out.

299
00:29:53,643 --> 00:29:55,785
[SPEAKER_04]: What is that name again, the consultant?

300
00:29:55,865 --> 00:29:56,405
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

301
00:29:57,066 --> 00:30:00,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Emily Innes, her last name is I-N-N-E-S.

302
00:30:01,749 --> 00:30:03,770
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's Innes Associates.

303
00:30:07,167 --> 00:30:27,374
[SPEAKER_04]: And actually, fun fact, the other thing that you'll be seeing coming out but is much less relevant to this board, other than Medford Square zoning, is the RFP to build residential buildings, preferably with ground floor commercial, on the parcels behind City Hall.

304
00:30:27,754 --> 00:30:29,255
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have three parcels here.

305
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:45,349
[SPEAKER_04]: And that actually one of the things on my to do list for this week that I'm never going to get to is to read it we have a solid draft, we actually hope to have that out on the street by September 12, and it'll be open for three months.

306
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:47,871
[SPEAKER_04]: for those parcels.

307
00:30:48,411 --> 00:30:52,793
[SPEAKER_04]: And Emily, by pure chance, is also the consultant on that.

308
00:30:53,593 --> 00:30:58,455
[SPEAKER_04]: We went to Mass Development, asked them for assistance in preparing this RFP.

309
00:30:58,895 --> 00:31:01,336
[SPEAKER_04]: And they said to us, well, we have this wonderful consultant.

310
00:31:01,356 --> 00:31:08,119
[SPEAKER_04]: We can give you technical assistance where we, Mass Development, will hire a consultant who will do it for you.

311
00:31:08,719 --> 00:31:11,100
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have this wonderful consultant, Emily Innes.

312
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,781
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me see if she has time.

313
00:31:12,801 --> 00:31:13,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you guys know her?

314
00:31:14,261 --> 00:31:14,882
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like,

315
00:31:16,099 --> 00:31:18,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well, there's some serious synergy going on here.

316
00:31:18,661 --> 00:31:18,701
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

317
00:31:21,043 --> 00:31:21,744
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Annie.

318
00:31:23,686 --> 00:31:29,751
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm curious about what was the final on Herb Chambers.

319
00:31:31,932 --> 00:31:44,443
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was approved, that was decided that down there at that at the end, at that exit to 93, that that was approved.

320
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:45,848
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

321
00:31:47,950 --> 00:32:07,750
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I believe that was one of those kind of the case we had with the auto glass, similar to the case we had with the auto glass place on Harvard Ave, that while it is not long term what we like to see for the corridor, that it is an appropriate use for the space as it stands.

322
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:09,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

323
00:32:10,362 --> 00:32:22,511
[SPEAKER_04]: And that one, and they are actually adding a significant large building to that, where they will be repairing and holding cars in a large building, and they'll have a lot of jobs associated with it.

324
00:32:22,951 --> 00:32:28,355
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not going to be just a big open parking lot with a tiny building on it.

325
00:32:28,996 --> 00:32:39,824
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's like what they did a further up for Toyota and Nissan off of 95, where it's the cars are, are

326
00:32:40,254 --> 00:32:42,516
[SPEAKER_08]: piled a couple of stories up.

327
00:32:43,777 --> 00:32:44,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

328
00:32:44,558 --> 00:32:51,043
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a more dense use than you would expect from an auto-based place.

329
00:32:52,644 --> 00:32:56,067
[SPEAKER_04]: So I might say not our favorite.

330
00:32:57,268 --> 00:33:04,954
[SPEAKER_04]: They're also probably going to be consolidating some of their corporate offices there, because it's such a beautiful view of the river.

331
00:33:05,415 --> 00:33:06,776
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was also kind of nice.

332
00:33:09,097 --> 00:33:17,764
[SPEAKER_09]: And without having to watch the entire meeting previously, Annie, or for anyone, the decision, I just approved and signed a decision.

333
00:33:18,164 --> 00:33:20,005
[SPEAKER_09]: So it should be filed with the clerk's office.

334
00:33:20,566 --> 00:33:22,047
[SPEAKER_09]: Danielle did that prior to her leave.

335
00:33:22,087 --> 00:33:26,350
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you want to see what came along with the decision, like the conditions.

336
00:33:28,271 --> 00:33:28,552
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

337
00:33:30,373 --> 00:33:35,177
[SPEAKER_05]: When we finish this discussion, can I ask about progress with the beer hall?

338
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:42,905
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I know they're behind schedule and that there were kind of a lot of questions that they were asking you guys.

339
00:33:43,165 --> 00:33:46,031
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just curious about the status since we mentioned it.

340
00:33:46,961 --> 00:33:47,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

341
00:33:47,522 --> 00:33:48,763
[SPEAKER_04]: We have been working with them.

342
00:33:48,783 --> 00:33:50,825
[SPEAKER_04]: We have been working with the department.

343
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:58,533
[SPEAKER_04]: So the newer members may not realize we also have working in our office, a director of economic development.

344
00:33:59,114 --> 00:34:07,703
[SPEAKER_04]: And so his part of his role is to bring in larger businesses, to work with businesses, to help shepherd them through the process as necessary and appropriate.

345
00:34:08,723 --> 00:34:10,245
[SPEAKER_04]: His name is Sal DiStefano.

346
00:34:11,225 --> 00:34:19,792
[SPEAKER_04]: And so Sal has been keeping close in touch with them and with all the different departments that need stuff from them.

347
00:34:20,212 --> 00:34:21,453
[SPEAKER_04]: So they are coming along.

348
00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:25,296
[SPEAKER_04]: I am not aware of them.

349
00:34:27,446 --> 00:34:30,009
[SPEAKER_04]: They had a ribbon cutting date.

350
00:34:30,049 --> 00:34:31,351
[SPEAKER_04]: They've had a couple scheduled.

351
00:34:31,411 --> 00:34:38,320
[SPEAKER_04]: They do not currently have one that I am aware of, but they are continuing to move along.

352
00:34:39,201 --> 00:34:39,361
[SPEAKER_04]: This

353
00:34:40,599 --> 00:35:00,988
[SPEAKER_04]: I would just say that the professionals in City Hall are not surprised by how long the project is taking, and the various pieces, especially because of the interplay with National Grid, the utilities, I think there was some MWRA piece, and MassDOT, the owner maybe.

354
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:06,251
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm glad to hear that we weren't the ones that completely wrecked that schedule.

355
00:35:07,071 --> 00:35:08,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no, not at all.

356
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:23,659
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't think anyone wrecked their schedule except to, I mean, I remember we talked about it a little last time it got brought up, that they had a date that kind of no one outside of them thought they were going to hit.

357
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:28,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Those of us who know how the project process goes were like, they're not going to do that.

358
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:35,127
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, their timeline was completely aggressive considering the circumstances surrounding

359
00:35:35,797 --> 00:35:38,419
[SPEAKER_09]: some of the things they had to get done, like MassDOT by itself.

360
00:35:40,661 --> 00:35:41,582
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

361
00:35:41,602 --> 00:35:44,524
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of segueing into that, I had a question.

362
00:35:44,685 --> 00:35:49,088
[SPEAKER_02]: You said that Emily had some ideas for the Mystic Ave corridor.

363
00:35:49,108 --> 00:36:00,078
[SPEAKER_02]: Was there a thought given in any of those ideas to the jurisdictional piece where Mystic Ave is a MassDOT road?

364
00:36:00,098 --> 00:36:01,419
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, I can think.

365
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:17,824
[SPEAKER_02]: Off the top of my head of multiple times, projects have come before this board that have had to deal with the fact that they need to get kind of MassDOT access permits or MassDOT approval for anything they do that touches the street.

366
00:36:19,045 --> 00:36:19,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

367
00:36:19,685 --> 00:36:30,810
[SPEAKER_04]: So in two ways, and actually I'm glad you said that because I was just thinking today that I may need to talk a little bit more explicitly with Emily about some of the MassDOT pieces to it.

368
00:36:31,871 --> 00:36:48,458
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you remember in the MBTA zoning that was approved last winter, one of the pieces that was not really talked about very much and was not really a big deal was some of the performance standards about how properties would be accessed

369
00:36:49,158 --> 00:37:03,288
[SPEAKER_04]: They had a lot of recommendations that loading would be in the back, that there would minimize curb cuts, minimize ways that they would get onto the property, but then deal with the access from behind.

370
00:37:04,069 --> 00:37:06,770
[SPEAKER_04]: That was actually built into the zoning.

371
00:37:07,611 --> 00:37:09,993
[SPEAKER_04]: I think some of that will actually help this.

372
00:37:10,533 --> 00:37:25,027
[SPEAKER_04]: if there are ways that we are right off the bat in our zoning saying to these developers, minimize your curb cuts, minimize how many times people are crossing the sidewalk, that may make it a little bit easier on the MassDOT side.

373
00:37:26,449 --> 00:37:28,611
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also a piece around the whole

374
00:37:29,892 --> 00:37:35,000
[SPEAKER_04]: And I thought this is where you were going about the sidewalk and the curb area.

375
00:37:36,643 --> 00:37:39,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me just quickly show you, they had a suggestion.

376
00:37:43,052 --> 00:38:01,457
[SPEAKER_04]: that we actually put in the zoning so that so this here in the gray is kind of what we have now where the red dotted line is the property line and people either build right up to the property line with the curb or they set back and they have parking in front of it.

377
00:38:02,766 --> 00:38:09,188
[SPEAKER_04]: They're suggesting that we have a build-to line that is not necessarily, is not a setback.

378
00:38:09,268 --> 00:38:16,109
[SPEAKER_04]: A setback would be you have to build behind it, but that this is the line at which you put your building.

379
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:30,373
[SPEAKER_04]: And then actually requires part of the zoning to have green space and sidewalk space, some of which, so this red dotted line might be your property line and the sidewalk might be on your property line.

380
00:38:30,993 --> 00:38:49,388
[SPEAKER_04]: and that there are ways to do this, and then we would work out easements, et cetera, to give us a more walkable feel, but also not allow them to set their buildings back and put parking in front of it, like in the area that would be a place for pedestrians.

381
00:38:49,809 --> 00:38:53,772
[SPEAKER_04]: And this was some of what it might look and feel like at different heights.

382
00:38:54,352 --> 00:38:56,915
[SPEAKER_04]: They were giving us some different ideas.

383
00:39:01,436 --> 00:39:04,217
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that is cool.

384
00:39:04,317 --> 00:39:17,720
[SPEAKER_02]: I was also thinking somewhat in the vein of... I mean, this is perhaps a little too granular for the zoning overhaul and more directly the things that are relevant to this board.

385
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:27,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Just the number of times we've... I mean, this is something else with the Great American Beer Hall, where we've had conditions that we've put on developers

386
00:39:28,069 --> 00:39:31,591
[SPEAKER_02]: that are contingent on Mass.Approval and they come back and don't get Mass.Approval.

387
00:39:31,831 --> 00:39:33,552
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have to figure something else out.

388
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:34,713
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

389
00:39:34,853 --> 00:39:48,382
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that was something that Danielle and Amanda and I have been talking about a little bit and Jackie, this idea of having contingencies, like pre-approved, like this is what we want you to do.

390
00:39:48,862 --> 00:39:51,344
[SPEAKER_04]: The beer haul was the hardest because

391
00:39:52,719 --> 00:40:07,517
[SPEAKER_04]: It never occurred to any of us that they would say you can't put your driveway there you have to shift it 15 feet to the left, but there may be some like guardrails that we can put around projects that say, you know, if you know the.

392
00:40:11,673 --> 00:40:30,791
[SPEAKER_04]: the modifications that you need to make are under a certain threshold then the staff can approve them administratively without you coming back to the board or if we have a sense that there's going to be different versions like what we're realizing would have made sense with the salt install was that we could have approved a

393
00:40:33,253 --> 00:40:46,626
[SPEAKER_04]: control site plan and then a secondary site plan that if you get control of that property, you may just revert to this other site plan that we can approve because you don't have legal control.

394
00:40:47,047 --> 00:40:50,090
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you get it, then you can do that and you don't have to come back.

395
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:57,257
[SPEAKER_04]: You just need to register that with the office that you are swapping in and this pre-approved alternative.

396
00:40:57,997 --> 00:41:03,126
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've noticed that we've been doing that for the last few months of meetings.

397
00:41:03,286 --> 00:41:04,128
[SPEAKER_02]: I do think that's a good idea.

398
00:41:04,803 --> 00:41:24,883
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and that's because of some of these things, because in order to have a sense of what is the difference between something that is major that the board needs to rethink that we hadn't considered versus this, you're being required by a state agency or something outside of your control.

399
00:41:24,903 --> 00:41:28,667
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's reasonable and it makes sense.

400
00:41:29,063 --> 00:41:32,265
[SPEAKER_04]: and you literally can't do what we had approved.

401
00:41:33,646 --> 00:41:36,568
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we do that without having to re-notice a whole public hearing?

402
00:41:44,494 --> 00:41:46,075
[SPEAKER_04]: So any other questions?

403
00:41:46,856 --> 00:41:52,640
[SPEAKER_04]: We promised to keep tonight short, but it's not even 7.30, which is our end of the workday anyhow.

404
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,902
[SPEAKER_04]: So if there are any other questions.

405
00:41:59,734 --> 00:42:00,094
[SPEAKER_09]: I have.

406
00:42:00,715 --> 00:42:01,915
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Jackie, you can go.

407
00:42:01,935 --> 00:42:03,496
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, go ahead.

408
00:42:03,557 --> 00:42:05,898
[SPEAKER_09]: I was about to go for your favorite item.

409
00:42:05,918 --> 00:42:09,020
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I think all of us at this point, go ahead.

410
00:42:09,721 --> 00:42:11,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, sorry, it'll be fast to end.

411
00:42:11,302 --> 00:42:28,693
[SPEAKER_05]: I can totally take this offline if, but while we're talking about Beer Hall, I was curious if they've gotten a alternative like driving exit route approved, because we had said that staff could approve it, but the proposed one had been

412
00:42:29,233 --> 00:42:30,214
[SPEAKER_05]: absolutely bonkers.

413
00:42:30,634 --> 00:42:34,457
[SPEAKER_05]: And since we're talking about it now, I'm curious if it's a new one.

414
00:42:34,577 --> 00:42:36,779
[SPEAKER_04]: We think that that would take quite a long time.

415
00:42:36,799 --> 00:42:46,787
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're not anticipating that that is something they would get approved before they open by by any stretch of the means of the imagination.

416
00:42:46,807 --> 00:42:52,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

417
00:42:52,491 --> 00:42:56,975
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

418
00:43:00,973 --> 00:43:03,955
[SPEAKER_05]: I see a question from, I think, a member of the public.

419
00:43:07,117 --> 00:43:07,858
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, hi.

420
00:43:08,338 --> 00:43:09,839
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Matthew Page Lieberman.

421
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:20,886
[SPEAKER_01]: Alicia, this Emily Ennis that you were talking about, Ennis, is this the same person you told me had circled the square who was contracted and would be advising on the parking lots?

422
00:43:22,207 --> 00:43:25,529
[SPEAKER_04]: The RF, yes, the parking lots in Medford Square, yes.

423
00:43:25,629 --> 00:43:29,332
[SPEAKER_04]: She's doing both that and the overall zoning for the city.

424
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:31,140
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good, thank you.

425
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,981
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any development on that?

426
00:43:35,521 --> 00:43:39,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, so the lots we are reviewing draft RFP right now.

427
00:43:39,983 --> 00:43:47,204
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually going to be legally advertised next week and it's going to be available to the public September 12th.

428
00:43:48,065 --> 00:43:56,547
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will say we have circulated it to some members of staff and council because the city council and legal

429
00:43:57,788 --> 00:44:00,550
[SPEAKER_04]: Council, although I better write that down.

430
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:03,932
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I might not have sent it to legal council yesterday.

431
00:44:06,434 --> 00:44:18,623
[SPEAKER_04]: And assuming that none of them have any showstopping issues with it, it is our intention to make it available to the public on September 12th with responses due to the city December 12th.

432
00:44:19,757 --> 00:44:32,240
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know that myself and many people, including Councilors, are opposed to the notion of having a singular RFP that would go out to both people that would like to purchase the lot or to lease the lot.

433
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:37,701
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this RFP that's going out going to be once it's going to continue to be all of the above?

434
00:44:38,542 --> 00:44:43,003
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually we have settled on putting it out as a 99-year lease.

435
00:44:43,763 --> 00:44:44,083
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.

436
00:44:44,123 --> 00:44:45,103
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so very much.

437
00:44:45,283 --> 00:44:46,364
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so very much, Alicia.

438
00:44:50,365 --> 00:44:51,106
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Alicia.

439
00:44:51,126 --> 00:44:57,670
[SPEAKER_09]: And with that, I am going to ask so that we're not adding other things to the agenda that have not been advertised.

440
00:44:57,710 --> 00:45:00,812
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to ask for a motion to adjourn.

441
00:45:03,133 --> 00:45:03,514
[SPEAKER_02]: So moved.

442
00:45:04,755 --> 00:45:05,215

[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, everyone, and have a great evening.

[SPEAKER_08]: You too.

460
00:45:31,105 --> 00:45:32,405
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye-bye.

00:45:32,525 --> 00:45:33,346
[SPEAKER_09]: Have a good night.

462

[SPEAKER_09]: And nice to meet all the new members.
