1
00:00:00,191 --> 00:00:05,076
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I'm going to call to meeting the order of the Medford Community Preservation Committee.

2
00:00:05,196 --> 00:00:12,362
[SPEAKER_02]: It is Tuesday, December 10th, 6.30 p.m., and we are meeting hybridly.

3
00:00:12,502 --> 00:00:17,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of us are in room 201 at Medford City Hall, and some of us are on Zoom right now.

4
00:00:19,268 --> 00:00:28,575
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the first order on the agenda tonight is an application presentation for the city council chamber window restoration.

5
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:33,098
[SPEAKER_02]: You all recall that last month we

6
00:00:36,777 --> 00:00:47,526
[SPEAKER_02]: learned that the city was going to be swapping out the bathrooms restoration for city council chamber windows.

7
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:54,772
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we have with us this evening, Paul Rieke, and I would like to invite you to tell us more about the city council chamber windows.

8
00:00:55,927 --> 00:00:56,907
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

9
00:00:57,708 --> 00:01:15,396
[SPEAKER_00]: It was brought to my attention by my outside window vendor when I asked them to come in to do a few window pane replacements for cracked glass that the council chamber's windows were starting to fail.

10
00:01:17,217 --> 00:01:28,705
[SPEAKER_00]: They took some pictures for me, which showed that the wood framing around the windows had started deteriorating in spots.

11
00:01:29,425 --> 00:01:37,851
[SPEAKER_00]: And that if that was not addressed, we could run into serious issues with the windows failing.

12
00:01:39,092 --> 00:01:40,693
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I mean failing, meaning

13
00:01:41,894 --> 00:01:46,198
[SPEAKER_00]: basically falling out of their frames.

14
00:01:46,218 --> 00:01:48,981
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I sent some pictures over.

15
00:01:49,721 --> 00:01:52,384
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure Teresa shared them with the committee.

16
00:01:52,844 --> 00:02:03,895
[SPEAKER_00]: That is just a sample of what the window framing looks like around all the windows in the council chambers.

17
00:02:05,337 --> 00:02:26,707
[SPEAKER_00]: Further delving into the issue, it was found that the best course of action would be to do an entire replacement of the windows to bring them back to the condition that they were when they were first installed in the council chambers.

18
00:02:27,527 --> 00:02:30,969
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did a request for proposals.

19
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:51,343
[SPEAKER_00]: With that request for proposals, it was made very clear to vendors that we would not allow anything else in the Council Chambers but historically accurate windows of the time period of when the Council Chambers and City Hall was built.

20
00:02:53,141 --> 00:03:13,515
[SPEAKER_00]: We arrived at one vendor who was able to meet that need, a general contractor who is working with Old Bostonian Window, who is a vendor who specializes in restoration of

21
00:03:14,948 --> 00:03:31,288
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, historic windows, they do work at Faneuil Hall, restoring those windows to accurate conditions, and they best fit the need for what we need to do at council chambers.

22
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:45,160
[SPEAKER_00]: City Hall serves a very historic nature for the city of Medford, and we need to keep those windows in the period of when the building was built.

23
00:03:46,181 --> 00:03:58,812
[SPEAKER_00]: And by doing this, we will give life back to those windows, and we know that they will last years and years once this is done.

24
00:04:02,095 --> 00:04:02,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

25
00:04:02,555 --> 00:04:05,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Teresa just shared with us the photos, and they do look alarming.

26
00:04:05,657 --> 00:04:17,482
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really appreciate that you are on top of getting this work done and working with a contractor who specializes in historic preservation.

27
00:04:17,562 --> 00:04:20,103
[SPEAKER_02]: So really applaud that work.

28
00:04:20,483 --> 00:04:22,464
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there questions from committee members?

29
00:04:25,425 --> 00:04:26,226
[SPEAKER_04]: Not so much a question.

30
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:28,387
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, I agree with everything Roberta just said.

31
00:04:28,427 --> 00:04:29,227
[SPEAKER_04]: You did the right thing.

32
00:04:29,267 --> 00:04:30,388
[SPEAKER_04]: You got the right contractor.

33
00:04:31,806 --> 00:04:34,807
[SPEAKER_04]: purchased some restored windows from Old Bostonia.

34
00:04:34,847 --> 00:04:40,468
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll take anything that can be fixed and make it a functioning window.

35
00:04:40,608 --> 00:04:43,449
[SPEAKER_04]: You're in good hands there, Mr. Riggs.

36
00:04:43,489 --> 00:04:44,209
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate that.

37
00:04:44,769 --> 00:04:58,652
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the only thing I'm looking for, and we don't need it to approve this tonight, is I'm really looking for before and after photos of all the windows so that there's proper documentation so that we actually have a clean record of not just a detail.

38
00:04:58,692 --> 00:05:01,433
[SPEAKER_04]: This detail is important to understand, but I think just a photograph,

39
00:05:02,313 --> 00:05:10,238
[SPEAKER_04]: of maybe a few of each window before they're removed and then when they come back so people can understand what they pay for.

40
00:05:10,278 --> 00:05:11,339
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lot of money per window.

41
00:05:11,719 --> 00:05:15,101
[SPEAKER_04]: It has to be that way given the scale of these windows.

42
00:05:17,703 --> 00:05:18,984
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be my primary concern.

43
00:05:20,004 --> 00:05:26,168
[SPEAKER_04]: The only other question I actually had was about storm windows, interior or exterior.

44
00:05:26,248 --> 00:05:27,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there any thought to that?

45
00:05:27,309 --> 00:05:28,730
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a single pane window, right?

46
00:05:29,437 --> 00:05:42,826
[SPEAKER_00]: There are already storm windows on them, and I think our plan is to try to restore them, leaving the current storm windows that are there make them more functional.

47
00:05:43,626 --> 00:05:46,728
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone down the line did add storm windows to.

48
00:05:48,029 --> 00:05:54,974
[SPEAKER_00]: those windows so we would try to keep it as weather-tight as possible also while we did this.

49
00:05:55,695 --> 00:06:10,226
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe, Doug, to answer your question, I think part of the cataloging they are doing will be photographic evidence of the windows, but I can make sure that they do that.

50
00:06:11,707 --> 00:06:30,204
[SPEAKER_00]: As part of the process as they're replacing these windows, because I agree it is very important that if someone does ask why was this money expensed that we can show them the photographic evidence of the need and how the need was met.

51
00:06:31,285 --> 00:06:32,206
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree and.

52
00:06:33,883 --> 00:06:41,146
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess when you take them out, you're going to leave the storms in, but are you putting temporary plywood or something inside?

53
00:06:41,726 --> 00:06:46,208
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going to happen is it's going to be done in two phases.

54
00:06:46,769 --> 00:06:54,432
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you see four windows, five windows, phase one, phase two, they also will be doing them on opposite sides.

55
00:06:54,532 --> 00:06:56,773
[SPEAKER_00]: So at no time will all the

56
00:06:57,633 --> 00:07:02,434
[SPEAKER_00]: windows say on the left side of the council chambers be removed so we have light.

57
00:07:02,554 --> 00:07:22,218
[SPEAKER_00]: Their plan is to make sure that plywood and necessary any kind of weatherproofing is put into the openings so that while they're doing the work, weather cannot go into the council chambers and cause any damage inside the council chambers.

58
00:07:23,238 --> 00:07:23,618
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

59
00:07:23,638 --> 00:07:24,218
[SPEAKER_04]: That's perfect.

60
00:07:24,238 --> 00:07:24,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

61
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:27,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

62
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:28,871
[SPEAKER_02]: And I see a question from Ari.

63
00:07:28,891 --> 00:07:32,072
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so these are questions.

64
00:07:32,132 --> 00:07:33,713
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this makes a lot of sense.

65
00:07:34,734 --> 00:07:41,897
[SPEAKER_05]: The first is, obviously, you can't know exactly, but how long do you expect this to take?

66
00:07:41,937 --> 00:07:46,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we talking like a three-month process, six-month, two-year?

67
00:07:46,739 --> 00:07:48,580
[SPEAKER_05]: What's our kind of general ballpark?

68
00:07:49,697 --> 00:07:55,320
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the impression that I think it may be six months or longer.

69
00:07:55,420 --> 00:08:10,407
[SPEAKER_00]: I never really delved into the time frame because I'm under the mindset is they need to take as long as it takes to do this properly.

70
00:08:10,867 --> 00:08:15,450
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of did not give them, I need it done by June.

71
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,731
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm relying on them.

72
00:08:18,551 --> 00:08:36,782
[SPEAKER_00]: to tell me once they really get these windows back to their shop how long it's going to take, you know, because you can't really tell until they actually start delving into each window how long that window is going to take to restore.

73
00:08:37,523 --> 00:08:42,286
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't want to pigeonhole them into, you know, give me, you know, give me a

74
00:08:43,006 --> 00:08:43,966
[SPEAKER_00]: firm deadline.

75
00:08:44,767 --> 00:08:49,988
[SPEAKER_00]: I, my gut is probably at least six months, but it may take longer.

76
00:08:50,769 --> 00:08:54,790
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I hope it would be faster, but I want them done properly.

77
00:08:55,190 --> 00:09:03,813
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want them to take their time and, you know, be very diligent as they renovate and rehab and bring these windows back.

78
00:09:05,494 --> 00:09:06,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

79
00:09:06,494 --> 00:09:09,415
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was, uh, I just, uh,

80
00:09:09,909 --> 00:09:14,692
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the public, in case anyone asks, I think it's helpful to have a sense of scale for the project.

81
00:09:15,132 --> 00:09:23,036
[SPEAKER_05]: My second question may be for you or maybe for Teresa or Roberta, is City Hall officially designated as a historic building?

82
00:09:23,217 --> 00:09:25,458
[SPEAKER_05]: And if not, should we require that be added?

83
00:09:25,478 --> 00:09:31,982
[SPEAKER_09]: It has been deemed historically significant by our local historical commission.

84
00:09:32,382 --> 00:09:33,122
[SPEAKER_09]: Part of

85
00:09:34,766 --> 00:09:45,889
[SPEAKER_09]: What we're trying to do whenever we fund specifically historic preservation projects on city owned properties is we're pursuing placing them either in a local historic district.

86
00:09:48,029 --> 00:10:03,593
[SPEAKER_09]: A preservation restriction would be nice, but right now we do have a letter of historically significance, historical significance from the historical commission and a condition of this funding would be to pursue putting this building on a local historic district.

87
00:10:04,739 --> 00:10:05,760
[SPEAKER_09]: Does that answer your question?

88
00:10:07,142 --> 00:10:07,583
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure does.

89
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,083
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

90
00:10:08,384 --> 00:10:08,704
[SPEAKER_09]: Excellent.

91
00:10:10,506 --> 00:10:10,967
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

92
00:10:10,987 --> 00:10:11,287
[SPEAKER_12]: Doug?

93
00:10:12,349 --> 00:10:15,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, just a follow-up comment on the scheduling, Mr. Riggi.

94
00:10:16,414 --> 00:10:19,738
[SPEAKER_04]: My experience with contractors is if you

95
00:10:21,215 --> 00:10:26,139
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't give them a deadline, you'll never get anything, because they'll always be too busy.

96
00:10:26,239 --> 00:10:27,880
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think they owe you something.

97
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:34,385
[SPEAKER_04]: To me, this feels like between three and five months, reasonably.

98
00:10:34,405 --> 00:10:38,628
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's actually like two weeks per window, roughly.

99
00:10:38,668 --> 00:10:41,029
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, obviously, everyone's busy.

100
00:10:41,049 --> 00:10:41,770
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a backlog.

101
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:43,271
[SPEAKER_04]: But they owe you something.

102
00:10:43,531 --> 00:10:44,992
[SPEAKER_04]: It can't be this open-ended.

103
00:10:47,834 --> 00:10:51,955
[SPEAKER_00]: I meant by not pigeonholing them saying I need them by this date.

104
00:10:52,635 --> 00:11:00,417
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, if they tell me two years, you'd probably see me jumping on my head, going crazy, not accepting that.

105
00:11:00,597 --> 00:11:04,999
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't want to put some pressure on them.

106
00:11:06,319 --> 00:11:20,731
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you know, I've never taken on something this massive, you know, and so I want to make sure, you know, once we do award this contract, of course, I'll have further discussions with them.

107
00:11:21,892 --> 00:11:22,372
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can.

108
00:11:23,293 --> 00:11:42,833
[SPEAKER_00]: get more to a meet of a schedule because I'm going to have to work with city council to make sure that the schedule, that they're aware that this is happening, that they know what to expect.

109
00:11:43,353 --> 00:11:46,696
[SPEAKER_00]: when they come into a council room and how long that's going.

110
00:11:47,557 --> 00:11:49,418
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to surprise the city council.

111
00:11:50,179 --> 00:11:53,422
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, there's going to be a deadline, a schedule.

112
00:11:53,502 --> 00:11:57,606
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I was referring to is I don't want to dictate that.

113
00:11:57,686 --> 00:11:59,547
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to work with them.

114
00:11:59,567 --> 00:12:02,290
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I was saying six months.

115
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:05,312
[SPEAKER_00]: I think six months is a fair enough schedule to do this.

116
00:12:06,433 --> 00:12:08,574
[SPEAKER_00]: gives them ample opportunity.

117
00:12:08,954 --> 00:12:16,758
[SPEAKER_00]: And my feeling is, is as they do four, when they're ready to install, the other five are coming out and they're doing the other five.

118
00:12:16,798 --> 00:12:20,320
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to bop off to another project or another town.

119
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,121
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to commit to doing hours.

120
00:12:23,581 --> 00:12:32,686
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we're not, you know, like some contractors like to do, they like to do part of the work, leave, and then you're wondering where they are and they suddenly come back.

121
00:12:33,206 --> 00:12:43,276
[SPEAKER_00]: No, when they start this project, my thing is nine windows are completed once at the end, not four.

122
00:12:43,656 --> 00:12:44,817
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to do nine.

123
00:12:44,837 --> 00:12:57,609
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if it could be helpful if we were to put a condition in a recommendation to say that

124
00:12:58,358 --> 00:13:19,174
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of a soft requirement that you can use to put leverage on the timeline for the project to say that the project has to be completed within a year, or we'll ask you to come back and talk to us, give us an update about the project and the intention would just be to.

125
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:26,187
[SPEAKER_02]: enable you to use leverage to make sure that the contractor is meeting the timeline.

126
00:13:26,887 --> 00:13:29,568
[SPEAKER_00]: That isn't a problem.

127
00:13:29,908 --> 00:13:37,290
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm dealing with many different pots of money that have different deadlines of when I have to expense them.

128
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:47,973
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually give vendors a deadline that's before when that money has to be expensed, just in case something's running late.

129
00:13:49,373 --> 00:13:51,355
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks and I see a question from Joe.

130
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:59,281
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I was just wondering what's their timeline in terms of their work schedule right now?

131
00:13:59,441 --> 00:14:00,542
[SPEAKER_06]: Are they busy?

132
00:14:00,622 --> 00:14:07,948
[SPEAKER_06]: Would they say we can start right away or would they start 3 months or they keep reaching out to me wondering what's going on.

133
00:14:08,128 --> 00:14:08,728
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a good.

134
00:14:10,609 --> 00:14:15,611
[SPEAKER_00]: They haven't forgotten about me and I told them that this meeting was coming up.

135
00:14:15,811 --> 00:14:19,172
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sure I'll hear from them very shortly.

136
00:14:19,272 --> 00:14:23,253
[SPEAKER_00]: So they, we've been keeping in touch with each other.

137
00:14:23,273 --> 00:14:25,174
[SPEAKER_00]: I've met with them on site.

138
00:14:25,294 --> 00:14:27,454
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know they're ready to go.

139
00:14:28,475 --> 00:14:32,256
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get a better sense if we do sign a contract of what

140
00:14:32,636 --> 00:14:46,883
[SPEAKER_00]: their time frame is to start and that, of course, as this project progresses, I'll always keep Teresa informed so she can keep the committee informed of what the schedule is and what the time frame is.

141
00:14:48,424 --> 00:14:54,907
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if anybody wants to come and see what's happening, they're more than welcome to come see what's happening also.

142
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:56,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.

143
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:11,675
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the timeline for this grant being final would be sometime in January, because we're waiting for a city council to approve that.

144
00:15:11,695 --> 00:15:11,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

145
00:15:12,576 --> 00:15:14,657
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's not a problem.

146
00:15:16,018 --> 00:15:16,459
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

147
00:15:17,619 --> 00:15:19,621
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other questions from committee members?

148
00:15:21,862 --> 00:15:22,863
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, thank you.

149
00:15:22,943 --> 00:15:25,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much, Mr. Riggi, for coming and

150
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,882
[SPEAKER_02]: presenting this to us this evening.

151
00:15:27,902 --> 00:15:39,655
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just, I want to acknowledge that this is a very clear cut and dry project that has been much easier for all of us to wrap our heads around.

152
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:46,963
[SPEAKER_02]: So I appreciate that and look forward to being able to work with you.

153
00:15:47,771 --> 00:15:50,653
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm glad the mayor suggested this.

154
00:15:50,733 --> 00:15:52,734
[SPEAKER_00]: This seems like a much better fit.

155
00:15:53,674 --> 00:15:56,996
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're much further along in this process.

156
00:15:57,536 --> 00:16:04,500
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's something that dovetails perfectly with the committee and the funding.

157
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,801
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's a win for everybody.

158
00:16:06,821 --> 00:16:08,362
[SPEAKER_11]: Agreed.

159
00:16:09,543 --> 00:16:10,383
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, everybody.

160
00:16:10,423 --> 00:16:11,284
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.

161
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:12,164
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

162
00:16:12,184 --> 00:16:12,645
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

163
00:16:12,665 --> 00:16:13,405
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a great night.

164
00:16:13,725 --> 00:16:14,185
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.

165
00:16:14,245 --> 00:16:14,506
[SPEAKER_00]: You too.

166
00:16:14,526 --> 00:16:14,646
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.

167
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:17,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

168
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:18,461
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

169
00:16:18,921 --> 00:16:25,604
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yes, let's introduce we have a new committee member with us this evening.

170
00:16:26,224 --> 00:16:29,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Excited to are we do we have a full committee now?

171
00:16:30,266 --> 00:16:32,648
[SPEAKER_09]: We still need a com com representative.

172
00:16:32,848 --> 00:16:34,108
[SPEAKER_09]: I've almost worn somebody down.

173
00:16:34,168 --> 00:16:34,889
[SPEAKER_02]: But my Asia, welcome.

174
00:16:34,949 --> 00:16:35,809
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you want to

175
00:16:41,985 --> 00:16:45,988
[SPEAKER_02]: introduce yourself to the committee and we can all actually introduce ourselves.

176
00:16:46,528 --> 00:16:47,349
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that'd be great.

177
00:16:47,769 --> 00:16:48,630
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, thank you.

178
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:49,150
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you hear me?

179
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,991
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I have my headphones on.

180
00:16:51,092 --> 00:16:52,472
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, awesome.

181
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,814
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can see, I'm unfortunately still at the office.

182
00:16:54,894 --> 00:16:57,136
[SPEAKER_01]: I was texting Teresa about that before.

183
00:16:57,156 --> 00:17:02,379
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully, I really want to make an in-person meeting next month, so fingers crossed.

184
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:04,861
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, my name is Mayesha.

185
00:17:05,281 --> 00:17:09,464
[SPEAKER_01]: I am currently working at a Solar Developer in the financing space.

186
00:17:09,664 --> 00:17:10,165
[SPEAKER_01]: So I

187
00:17:10,745 --> 00:17:13,126
[SPEAKER_01]: raise tax equity and debt for solar projects.

188
00:17:13,146 --> 00:17:18,048
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of them are in Massachusetts, that's really cool, but around the New England area in general.

189
00:17:18,628 --> 00:17:26,311
[SPEAKER_01]: I've lived in Medford for a little over seven years now, so love living here, want to give back in some way, just get more involved.

190
00:17:26,511 --> 00:17:32,513
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for letting me be a part of this, and I'm glad I finally got sworn in on Friday, it was very exciting.

191
00:17:32,813 --> 00:17:37,815
[SPEAKER_01]: And City Hall looks really nice right now, so if you haven't been there with all the Christmas decorations, I highly recommend.

192
00:17:38,956 --> 00:17:41,900
[SPEAKER_09]: You should just leave them up while you're around.

193
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:49,972
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've met before, Roberta, and I'll talk with you again at a later time.

194
00:17:50,092 --> 00:17:53,036
[SPEAKER_02]: But let's go around the rest of the committee members.

195
00:17:53,056 --> 00:17:54,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Joan.

196
00:17:56,632 --> 00:18:01,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, I'm Aisha Jones-Sear, been on the committee since the committee got formed.

197
00:18:04,941 --> 00:18:09,066
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm in North Medford, so up near Malden and the Fells.

198
00:18:10,447 --> 00:18:17,094
[SPEAKER_06]: By day, I work at Northeastern University as a Director of Research Operations and Systems.

199
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:26,809
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to the committee and I too wanted to sort of give back and have a voice really in what was going on around me.

200
00:18:26,869 --> 00:18:29,230
[SPEAKER_06]: So welcome, looking forward to working with you.

201
00:18:32,331 --> 00:18:38,054
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to call on... Doug, you're next in line on my view.

202
00:18:38,074 --> 00:18:43,556
[SPEAKER_04]: And by night, Joan obviously travels to northern Canada with the northern lights behind her.

203
00:18:43,576 --> 00:18:44,456
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't it beautiful?

204
00:18:44,516 --> 00:18:44,876
[SPEAKER_03]: It's amazing.

205
00:18:47,415 --> 00:18:48,156
[SPEAKER_04]: It is amazing.

206
00:18:48,216 --> 00:18:49,256
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know we saw that.

207
00:18:49,897 --> 00:18:50,917
[SPEAKER_04]: Doug Carr, I'm wearing the

208
00:18:55,545 --> 00:19:14,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Medford Historic Commission hat, although I wear many hats in Medford because I'm deeply involved in a bunch of stuff, mostly the Brooks Estate that I've worked on for about 25 or so years as a nonprofit, as we do with the city, which recently this committee has been very generous to over the years.

209
00:19:14,169 --> 00:19:15,589
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, this is the first round.

210
00:19:15,629 --> 00:19:18,890
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't actually asked for any money as a group.

211
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:22,491
[SPEAKER_04]: And I recuse myself when we talk about the Brooks Estate's voting, obviously.

212
00:19:24,391 --> 00:19:27,733
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, this is a really strong committee.

213
00:19:27,793 --> 00:19:37,220
[SPEAKER_04]: This committee has really been very active and it's one of my favorite jobs in Medford is to give away two plus million dollars every year to worthy projects and make sure that they're done well.

214
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:46,346
[SPEAKER_04]: We're establishing a pretty good track record and this group has been really thoughtful and deliberate and transparent about everything we do.

215
00:19:47,147 --> 00:19:47,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the committee.

216
00:19:50,529 --> 00:19:50,930
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

217
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:51,330
[SPEAKER_12]: Kayleigh?

218
00:19:53,563 --> 00:19:54,464
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, my name is Kayleen.

219
00:19:56,144 --> 00:19:58,446
[SPEAKER_07]: I am the housing authority representative on this board.

220
00:19:58,506 --> 00:20:01,047
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been on it for a little over a year.

221
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:04,769
[SPEAKER_07]: I live over in West Medford, right across from the Brooks Estate.

222
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:09,371
[SPEAKER_07]: And by day I am the director of the Lexington Housing Authority.

223
00:20:09,391 --> 00:20:14,054
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, that's about it.

224
00:20:15,895 --> 00:20:16,195
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

225
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:19,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Great, thank you.

226
00:20:20,461 --> 00:20:21,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to the committee.

227
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:23,123
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm Ari Fishman.

228
00:20:23,143 --> 00:20:24,565
[SPEAKER_05]: They, them pronouns, please.

229
00:20:25,185 --> 00:20:35,814
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm the representative from the Community Development Board, which is one of our two zoning boards, and I got a very exciting letter of we're being sued by a very mad applicant who we turned down.

230
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:37,415
[SPEAKER_05]: He threatened to do it.

231
00:20:37,435 --> 00:20:41,959
[SPEAKER_05]: He's the first one who threatened in my two years there that followed through, so that's very exciting.

232
00:20:41,979 --> 00:20:45,922
[SPEAKER_05]: I live near Medford Square.

233
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:53,532
[SPEAKER_05]: And by day, I am a research librarian at a semiconductor engineering company.

234
00:20:54,113 --> 00:21:01,517
[SPEAKER_05]: And before that, I was the librarian for the urban planning department at Tufts.

235
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:03,558
[SPEAKER_11]: And we have in the room with us.

236
00:21:04,358 --> 00:21:12,142
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, I'm the other mayoral appointee, and I just started maybe like three or four months ago, something like that.

237
00:21:12,322 --> 00:21:13,603
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm also pretty brand new.

238
00:21:14,499 --> 00:21:20,462
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm also here because I love being involved and knowing what's up in my town.

239
00:21:20,662 --> 00:21:25,105
[SPEAKER_11]: I've also been here for about seven years, eight years, going on eight years.

240
00:21:25,465 --> 00:21:27,906
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's pretty much it.

241
00:21:27,946 --> 00:21:28,927
[SPEAKER_11]: By day, I'm a therapist.

242
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:32,809
[SPEAKER_11]: By night, just involved in activism and stuff.

243
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:35,550
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

244
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:37,972
[SPEAKER_02]: So just a little procedural comment.

245
00:21:39,773 --> 00:21:44,895
[SPEAKER_02]: As you are probably aware, tonight is sort of the culmination of our year's work.

246
00:21:45,816 --> 00:21:52,979
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have a slate of projects that we are about to vote on whether to recommend funding.

247
00:21:53,659 --> 00:21:58,241
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've actually even had a lot of discussion about these projects at our previous meetings.

248
00:21:58,361 --> 00:22:00,902
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know if you've had the opportunity to review

249
00:22:05,281 --> 00:22:07,702
[SPEAKER_02]: recordings of previous meetings or not.

250
00:22:07,822 --> 00:22:09,543
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're fully sworn in.

251
00:22:09,683 --> 00:22:16,645
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a vote, but if you feel more comfortable abstaining when we vote, that's understood.

252
00:22:17,725 --> 00:22:18,646
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really up to you.

253
00:22:20,048 --> 00:22:20,709
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sounds great.

254
00:22:21,209 --> 00:22:27,953
[SPEAKER_01]: Teresa is really helpful with the good summary this morning, but I was able to get through some of the videos and materials while I was at work.

255
00:22:28,153 --> 00:22:34,317
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really a lot of really awesome applications, so it's great to see it's getting put to good use.

256
00:22:34,337 --> 00:22:36,499
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

257
00:22:36,979 --> 00:22:38,300
[SPEAKER_08]: And did you have another comment, Jen?

258
00:22:40,753 --> 00:22:46,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't know, somehow I thought I saw it out of the corner of my eye.

259
00:22:46,597 --> 00:22:56,244
[SPEAKER_06]: You probably heard my mind thinking back at, you know, our first time voting when we had the Andre, you know, vote of approval for all.

260
00:22:57,485 --> 00:23:08,253
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, that Jonah's referring to, we had a member of our very first iteration of the committee who had a principle that we should spend as little time

261
00:23:09,314 --> 00:23:18,145
[SPEAKER_02]: discussing things as necessary and that we should just have a vote at the beginning saying, do I recommend all of these projects?

262
00:23:18,386 --> 00:23:18,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

263
00:23:18,986 --> 00:23:23,813
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're not going to be quite that different than your style.

264
00:23:26,735 --> 00:23:35,058
[SPEAKER_02]: We never quite managed to meet that scale of efficiency, but we will.

265
00:23:35,858 --> 00:23:43,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we do our best to be efficient yet to also give everything the time that it needs to make a good decision.

266
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:55,063
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to go through each of the projects in the order that they appear on the spreadsheet that Teresa shared in the meeting packet this evening.

267
00:23:56,215 --> 00:23:57,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.

268
00:23:57,416 --> 00:24:02,740
[SPEAKER_02]: And the first on the list is the Riverside Plaza Shade Structure Improvement.

269
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,201
[SPEAKER_02]: Which we've already voted on last time.

270
00:24:04,642 --> 00:24:06,183
[SPEAKER_02]: We voted on the last time.

271
00:24:06,783 --> 00:24:07,084
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

272
00:24:07,324 --> 00:24:07,644
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

273
00:24:07,664 --> 00:24:10,126
[SPEAKER_02]: So we awarded 144 to 5-0.

274
00:24:10,146 --> 00:24:10,867
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all right.

275
00:24:11,687 --> 00:24:15,110
[SPEAKER_02]: Theresa knows that I like pencils, and so she puts them next to me.

276
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:16,971
[SPEAKER_02]: She is so, so.

277
00:24:17,111 --> 00:24:19,694
[SPEAKER_02]: And I put a spare, just in case 1.5.

278
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:27,915
[SPEAKER_09]: For the rest of the committee, would it be helpful if I shared the financial spreadsheet that had that high level?

279
00:24:28,755 --> 00:24:30,117
[SPEAKER_09]: I got a hearty thumbs up.

280
00:24:30,557 --> 00:24:37,223
[SPEAKER_02]: And it will also be helpful for you to pull up the recommendation letters for each one that we talk about as well.

281
00:24:37,283 --> 00:24:40,505
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't want to.

282
00:24:41,026 --> 00:24:45,069
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'll just share this, and then I can toggle between them.

283
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:45,930
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

284
00:24:46,471 --> 00:24:47,351
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we've done this.

285
00:24:48,378 --> 00:24:53,982
[SPEAKER_09]: What, a year and a half now, I'm still figuring out how to share multiple screens for people virtually as well as in the room.

286
00:24:54,002 --> 00:24:54,943
[SPEAKER_09]: So bear with me.

287
00:24:55,323 --> 00:24:59,806
[SPEAKER_09]: It feels like it never works the same way twice.

288
00:25:00,066 --> 00:25:02,088
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, the good thing is we have physical copies though.

289
00:25:02,388 --> 00:25:02,588
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

290
00:25:03,069 --> 00:25:04,530
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't need to see it on the screen.

291
00:25:06,331 --> 00:25:06,951
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's true.

292
00:25:08,372 --> 00:25:12,996
[SPEAKER_09]: Are folks seeing the spreadsheet with the different colors?

293
00:25:14,197 --> 00:25:14,477
[SPEAKER_09]: Excellent.

294
00:25:14,517 --> 00:25:14,797
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

295
00:25:15,037 --> 00:25:15,257
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

296
00:25:15,518 --> 00:25:15,658
[SPEAKER_09]: Cool.

297
00:25:15,678 --> 00:25:16,018
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

298
00:25:16,523 --> 00:25:16,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

299
00:25:17,523 --> 00:25:21,144
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've already awarded the funding for the first one.

300
00:25:21,164 --> 00:25:32,008
[SPEAKER_02]: So the second one is the car park renovation phase two tranche, which is a request for $146,000.

301
00:25:32,768 --> 00:25:45,112
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of these, but one we identified at our last meeting that we felt strongly they merited the high priority for funding.

302
00:25:46,193 --> 00:25:50,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, 1 of them, we felt maybe needed a little bit further discussion.

303
00:25:50,936 --> 00:25:53,918
[SPEAKER_02]: We were questioning, but we'll come to that later.

304
00:25:53,938 --> 00:25:54,539
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

305
00:25:54,559 --> 00:26:03,965
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're looking at the screen right now is the recommendation letter for the car park phase 2 project.

306
00:26:05,225 --> 00:26:09,048
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have no conditions attached to this.

307
00:26:09,564 --> 00:26:20,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Given that this is the third time that we're providing funding for the car park, we've probably already covered all of the conditions that are needed for the car park project.

308
00:26:21,407 --> 00:26:21,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

309
00:26:22,087 --> 00:26:31,909
[SPEAKER_02]: So does anyone want to make a motion to recommend funding for the car park phase two?

310
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:35,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to recommend funding.

311
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,441
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll go right ahead.

312
00:26:38,601 --> 00:26:39,441
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll second.

313
00:26:39,461 --> 00:26:41,182
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to recommend funding.

314
00:26:42,583 --> 00:26:44,203
[SPEAKER_02]: And second from Joan.

315
00:26:45,444 --> 00:26:47,185
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will call the roll.

316
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:55,188
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sorry, I didn't say it exactly correctly when I defined that motion that you all made and seconded.

317
00:26:55,288 --> 00:26:59,870
[SPEAKER_02]: It was to fund car park phase two to be awarded $146,000.

318
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:05,711
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to make sure that that doesn't fall through the cracks.

319
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:09,751
[SPEAKER_02]: So I am going to call the roll.

320
00:27:09,851 --> 00:27:10,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Doug?

321
00:27:10,831 --> 00:27:11,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

322
00:27:12,292 --> 00:27:12,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Joan?

323
00:27:13,452 --> 00:27:13,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

324
00:27:15,512 --> 00:27:15,812
[SPEAKER_02]: Ada?

325
00:27:16,032 --> 00:27:16,252
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

326
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:17,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Ari?

327
00:27:18,393 --> 00:27:18,653
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

328
00:27:19,593 --> 00:27:20,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Kaylene?

329
00:27:20,793 --> 00:27:21,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

330
00:27:22,993 --> 00:27:23,834
[SPEAKER_02]: And Myesha?

331
00:27:24,794 --> 00:27:25,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

332
00:27:27,974 --> 00:27:29,154
[SPEAKER_02]: And Roberta?

333
00:27:29,375 --> 00:27:30,415
[SPEAKER_02]: And myself, yes.

334
00:27:31,535 --> 00:27:31,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

335
00:27:34,088 --> 00:27:37,850
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that one passes unanimously.

336
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:43,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on to the second one, which is the Condon Shell Lighting Improvements.

337
00:27:43,553 --> 00:27:52,737
[SPEAKER_02]: And I appreciate that they submitted a memorandum addressing the concerns that I raised about the

338
00:27:55,598 --> 00:27:59,981
[SPEAKER_02]: The use of the expanding the use of the park into later hours.

339
00:28:00,821 --> 00:28:01,862
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I am.

340
00:28:02,482 --> 00:28:03,583
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm satisfied with that.

341
00:28:03,643 --> 00:28:06,565
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't feel that we need to make any conditions related to that.

342
00:28:06,585 --> 00:28:12,208
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to call it out any more than it is, but I feel like we've just address that.

343
00:28:12,669 --> 00:28:17,432
[SPEAKER_02]: That concern, so we're going to pull up the.

344
00:28:19,813 --> 00:28:24,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Conditions of approval, no conditions are suggested for this.

345
00:28:25,135 --> 00:28:29,816
[SPEAKER_02]: So does anyone feel that there ought to be any conditions?

346
00:28:31,677 --> 00:28:33,397
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

347
00:28:33,517 --> 00:28:38,398
[SPEAKER_02]: So would someone like to make a motion to award 98,285 for the electrical improvements at Condon Shelfield?

348
00:28:48,702 --> 00:28:49,102
[SPEAKER_10]: Go ahead.

349
00:28:49,723 --> 00:28:51,503
[SPEAKER_10]: Come on, Doug.

350
00:28:52,084 --> 00:28:52,944
[SPEAKER_04]: I will make a motion.

351
00:28:52,964 --> 00:28:53,684
[SPEAKER_04]: So moved.

352
00:28:54,665 --> 00:28:55,685
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

353
00:28:56,466 --> 00:28:56,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Second.

354
00:28:58,167 --> 00:28:58,607
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

355
00:28:58,727 --> 00:28:59,727
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will call the roll.

356
00:28:59,907 --> 00:29:00,208
[SPEAKER_02]: Doug?

357
00:29:00,708 --> 00:29:00,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

358
00:29:01,528 --> 00:29:02,049
[SPEAKER_12]: Joan?

359
00:29:02,789 --> 00:29:03,049
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

360
00:29:04,009 --> 00:29:04,310
[SPEAKER_12]: Ada?

361
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:04,890
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

362
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:05,470
[SPEAKER_12]: Ari?

363
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:06,251
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

364
00:29:07,131 --> 00:29:07,631
[SPEAKER_12]: Haylene?

365
00:29:08,071 --> 00:29:08,312
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

366
00:29:09,132 --> 00:29:09,752
[SPEAKER_12]: Maisha?

367
00:29:10,733 --> 00:29:10,953
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

368
00:29:11,913 --> 00:29:12,834
[SPEAKER_02]: And myself, yes.

369
00:29:14,935 --> 00:29:15,255
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

370
00:29:19,504 --> 00:29:23,287
[SPEAKER_02]: The next project is Playstead Park Tennis Courts reconstruction.

371
00:29:25,249 --> 00:29:26,910
[SPEAKER_02]: And the amount requested is $526,000.

372
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:30,973
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was one that we had not quite reached a consensus about.

373
00:29:37,555 --> 00:29:50,402
[SPEAKER_02]: an option if we were ready to just recommend the funding as requested, or if we'd like to hold off on this one until after we look at all of the other projects.

374
00:29:52,903 --> 00:29:56,805
[SPEAKER_02]: Any of you have a suggestion for how we'd like to handle this?

375
00:29:57,626 --> 00:29:59,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Joe, remind me of the hesitation last time.

376
00:30:00,087 --> 00:30:01,188
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember the details.

377
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:14,661
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that the hesitation last time was just because of the size, the amount of the budget, the size of the area that they're going to be replacing the field for.

378
00:30:15,562 --> 00:30:25,391
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe a question about how often do they have to replace tennis courts for a sum of $500,000?

379
00:30:29,847 --> 00:30:38,592
[SPEAKER_11]: My, my sense from our last discussion was that we didn't like how much it costs, but we basically were like, yes, this needs to happen.

380
00:30:38,612 --> 00:30:41,434
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, or at least that was my takeaway.

381
00:30:42,294 --> 00:30:47,317
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's not like replacing another, it's not like another project is not going to happen because of this one.

382
00:30:47,638 --> 00:30:53,441
[SPEAKER_11]: So if it were me, I would say we could, we should go ahead and vote, but that's just me.

383
00:30:54,965 --> 00:30:57,506
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think there's three tennis courts over there, right?

384
00:30:57,886 --> 00:31:01,667
[SPEAKER_06]: And they are also striped for pickleball.

385
00:31:02,747 --> 00:31:03,387
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that correct?

386
00:31:03,927 --> 00:31:04,887
[SPEAKER_09]: They will be, yes.

387
00:31:05,487 --> 00:31:07,948
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they currently are, and they will continue to be.

388
00:31:09,268 --> 00:31:20,011
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think, I don't know, I got the sense that, I believe, Ari, didn't you say that these courts were used a lot for some tournaments or

389
00:31:21,662 --> 00:31:25,904
[SPEAKER_05]: That was not me.

390
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:29,145
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think Reg shared that the U.S.

391
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:31,906
[SPEAKER_09]: Penis Association rents them out every Saturday.

392
00:31:31,926 --> 00:31:43,951
[SPEAKER_09]: And we were hoping that there was a fee associated with that permit and that we're charging them accordingly to recoup some revenue was the discussion.

393
00:31:43,971 --> 00:31:48,373
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope the fee went up.

394
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:50,354
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish Reg was here.

395
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:57,068
[SPEAKER_09]: Red was under the weather today, but he staffs the parks commission.

396
00:31:57,088 --> 00:31:58,991
[SPEAKER_09]: He's actually the chairperson.

397
00:31:59,692 --> 00:32:05,841
[SPEAKER_09]: So they can help dictate that pricing structure, but just sharing that those were the concerns.

398
00:32:08,048 --> 00:32:20,135
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that I had was that I had heard from some constituents that, you know, it was almost like a territorial thing with the tennis players over there and that the pickleball players felt sort of pushed aside.

399
00:32:20,716 --> 00:32:30,702
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know if there's anything that we can, I mean, clearly we're going to say in the conditions that it gets stripped, striped for pickleball, but I don't know if the rec department

400
00:32:31,102 --> 00:32:45,586
[SPEAKER_06]: has any plans similar to what I think they have in the plan for the car park pickleball courts for some sort of sign up or registration to use so that there's no issues around use of the courts.

401
00:32:47,667 --> 00:32:52,048
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we want to make that a condition that they would seek partnership?

402
00:32:52,108 --> 00:32:59,790
[SPEAKER_09]: The DPW is the applicant here, but recreation would be the one that executes and plans the usage

403
00:33:00,443 --> 00:33:01,724
[SPEAKER_09]: of the programming that's on it.

404
00:33:01,804 --> 00:33:06,788
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, I see that you have your hand raised, Ari.

405
00:33:07,329 --> 00:33:12,773
[SPEAKER_09]: But we could make that a condition somehow, like DPW to partner with recreation on.

406
00:33:12,793 --> 00:33:15,415
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good question.

407
00:33:15,435 --> 00:33:21,560
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to chew on that in my brain while I hear Ari's question or comment.

408
00:33:23,824 --> 00:33:26,246
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was jumping in.

409
00:33:26,266 --> 00:33:44,519
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the way I remembered our last conversation is that we were startled at the cost, but that it was explained adequately by DPW and that this is the main tennis section for the city that it's used constantly.

410
00:33:44,539 --> 00:33:51,705
[SPEAKER_05]: I am open to the idea of adding in a condition to work with the

411
00:33:53,484 --> 00:33:57,349
[SPEAKER_05]: recreation to create a system, they kind of have to do that anyway.

412
00:33:58,129 --> 00:34:04,717
[SPEAKER_05]: From what I know about pickleball and tennis is right now they're very confrontational towards each other.

413
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:10,404
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know that I want to get involved, but someone should manage that and that person should not be me.

414
00:34:12,821 --> 00:34:20,905
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the other issue we brought up was that when we looked at the pictures they showed us, it didn't look like it was in that bad of shape.

415
00:34:20,965 --> 00:34:24,787
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we've seen courts that were really worse.

416
00:34:24,907 --> 00:34:26,628
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was the other issue.

417
00:34:26,748 --> 00:34:41,415
[SPEAKER_11]: I think to Ari's point about setting the condition, maybe it would be helpful to just talk to the departments that are involved before we create our own condition, just because they're the ones

418
00:34:42,102 --> 00:34:48,006
[SPEAKER_11]: that are dealing with that, I get their guidance on what would be an appropriate thing to put in here.

419
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:51,248
[SPEAKER_11]: I agree with that.

420
00:34:51,588 --> 00:34:55,850
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel as though I don't want to be overly prescriptive.

421
00:34:57,171 --> 00:35:09,338
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's fun to use the leverage of money to tell people what to do, but I think we have to be used that judiciously.

422
00:35:10,938 --> 00:35:16,667
[SPEAKER_02]: Using it to leverage one department to talk to another department, I think, feels like an overreach.

423
00:35:21,433 --> 00:35:28,596
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciated how the recreation department addressed our concerns with the memorandum.

424
00:35:28,696 --> 00:35:34,878
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was very helpful that we used the application process to ask for that to be addressed.

425
00:35:35,338 --> 00:35:37,939
[SPEAKER_02]: And here we are about to make a recommendation.

426
00:35:38,059 --> 00:35:41,140
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't have that leverage anymore.

427
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:49,143
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is unfortunate that we don't have Reggie here this evening who could be the messenger

428
00:35:50,247 --> 00:35:59,913
[SPEAKER_02]: for this, but maybe it's just some feedback that we can give off the record that we'd really like to.

429
00:36:00,033 --> 00:36:05,196
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do agree perhaps with Joan's suggestion for a condition to striped.

430
00:36:05,957 --> 00:36:08,638
[SPEAKER_02]: We recommend that it be striped for pickleball.

431
00:36:09,779 --> 00:36:11,240
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure that it currently is.

432
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:16,503
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they put up temporary nets or something, but I don't know.

433
00:36:16,523 --> 00:36:17,324
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember.

434
00:36:17,344 --> 00:36:19,005
[SPEAKER_06]: It might be a temporary thing.

435
00:36:20,181 --> 00:36:35,031
[SPEAKER_05]: I do remember that they use that for high school tennis and there are some regulations around that, but I don't think that precludes having multiple striping so long as the tennis striping follows whatever high school regulations.

436
00:36:36,692 --> 00:36:38,814
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone's going to need to fact check me on that though.

437
00:36:38,834 --> 00:36:43,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, again,

438
00:36:45,845 --> 00:36:52,608
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, maybe just by putting the condition of striping of such a pickleball is going to be enough of a suggestion.

439
00:36:53,909 --> 00:36:54,970
[SPEAKER_06]: It will be pickleball.

440
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:57,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's true.

441
00:36:57,391 --> 00:36:57,431
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

442
00:36:57,811 --> 00:36:58,151
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

443
00:36:58,731 --> 00:37:10,597
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe, you know, in this case, because it's DPW who made the request, just a physical condition is sufficient.

444
00:37:10,617 --> 00:37:13,939
[SPEAKER_02]: And then hopefully Reggie can also

445
00:37:15,202 --> 00:37:22,325
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, use this information and Teresa can use this discussion to suggest further conversations offline.

446
00:37:24,706 --> 00:37:33,390
[SPEAKER_11]: Might be good to talk to them about the exact wording because the striping violates whatever the standards have to be met by the high school tenants, whatever.

447
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:36,211
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean?

448
00:37:36,511 --> 00:37:37,412
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I'm sure.

449
00:37:37,632 --> 00:37:42,274
[SPEAKER_11]: Like if there isn't current striping, maybe there's a reason that there's temporary net but not striping.

450
00:37:42,917 --> 00:37:52,460
[SPEAKER_05]: My guess is that it's old, because I'm thinking of basketball courts in high school gyms are used for official games, but also have striping for everything under the sun.

451
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,121
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know there's different sports associations, but.

452
00:37:56,341 --> 00:37:57,382
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

453
00:37:57,602 --> 00:37:58,602
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess, yeah.

454
00:37:58,622 --> 00:38:06,224
[SPEAKER_11]: It would be good to not put something in our formal approval that is going to somehow undermine our ability to fund it.

455
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:07,085
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

456
00:38:07,105 --> 00:38:11,806
[SPEAKER_06]: What I mean, in that sentence, with as appropriate.

457
00:38:13,123 --> 00:38:14,063
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, yeah.

458
00:38:18,505 --> 00:38:19,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, yeah.

459
00:38:19,806 --> 00:38:24,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that Duggar was the first park that we had that had pickleball striping.

460
00:38:25,829 --> 00:38:28,150
[SPEAKER_02]: So this park is older than Duggar.

461
00:38:30,231 --> 00:38:31,811
[SPEAKER_02]: And courts is singular.

462
00:38:32,171 --> 00:38:33,152
[SPEAKER_06]: There are three courts.

463
00:38:42,645 --> 00:38:42,986
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks.

464
00:38:43,787 --> 00:38:46,310
[SPEAKER_10]: That's good.

465
00:38:48,233 --> 00:38:48,414
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

466
00:38:48,434 --> 00:38:54,042
[SPEAKER_02]: So, with that, I would ask if there's a motion to recommend that.

467
00:38:58,292 --> 00:39:20,461
[SPEAKER_02]: $526,000 be awarded for the resurfacing of Placed In Park tennis courts with the conditions that the DPW provide an annual maintenance plan to the CPC and that the DPW will ensure that the courts have sufficient paint striping for pickleball usage as appropriate.

468
00:39:21,661 --> 00:39:22,362
[SPEAKER_01]: So moved.

469
00:39:24,216 --> 00:39:25,937
[SPEAKER_01]: Second, this is my new kitten.

470
00:39:27,257 --> 00:39:28,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay, look at that!

471
00:39:29,438 --> 00:39:30,718
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the kitten's name?

472
00:39:31,338 --> 00:39:31,839
[SPEAKER_06]: Mystic.

473
00:39:32,759 --> 00:39:34,699
[SPEAKER_06]: Mystic, what do you hold?

474
00:39:34,719 --> 00:39:35,760
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

475
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:37,240
[SPEAKER_06]: Mystic holds meow.

476
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:40,521
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I make that meow here?

477
00:39:41,142 --> 00:39:44,323
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so I'm going to call the roll.

478
00:39:44,363 --> 00:39:44,643
[SPEAKER_08]: Doug?

479
00:39:45,603 --> 00:39:45,943
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

480
00:39:46,823 --> 00:39:47,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Joan?

481
00:39:47,944 --> 00:39:48,224
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

482
00:39:49,064 --> 00:39:49,364
[SPEAKER_02]: Ada?

483
00:39:49,564 --> 00:39:49,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

484
00:39:50,245 --> 00:39:50,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Ari?

485
00:39:51,085 --> 00:39:51,245
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

486
00:39:52,167 --> 00:39:52,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Kaylene?

487
00:39:53,288 --> 00:39:53,548
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

488
00:39:54,369 --> 00:39:54,969
[SPEAKER_02]: Myesha?

489
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:56,090
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

490
00:39:56,991 --> 00:39:57,911
[SPEAKER_02]: And myself, yes.

491
00:39:59,593 --> 00:40:07,538
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know this is past the point, but I do want to clarify that I probably would have been asking more questions if we didn't have enough money to fund everything this year.

492
00:40:07,959 --> 00:40:14,464
[SPEAKER_05]: But since we do, it seems like a lovely chance to actually do suggested maintenance when it's supposed to be done instead of letting it get worse.

493
00:40:14,604 --> 00:40:17,246
[SPEAKER_11]: That's exactly how I feel about it.

494
00:40:17,666 --> 00:40:18,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

495
00:40:19,728 --> 00:40:20,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

496
00:40:20,987 --> 00:40:23,009
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, thank you.

497
00:40:23,069 --> 00:40:33,999
[SPEAKER_02]: So the next project is for the Unitarian Universalist Church, and it is for the exterior siding restoration of their property.

498
00:40:34,019 --> 00:40:37,361
[SPEAKER_10]: And we'll see the...

499
00:40:46,124 --> 00:40:48,065
[SPEAKER_02]: We can come back to that one, I'm sorry.

500
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:52,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we can come back to that one.

501
00:40:56,890 --> 00:40:57,930
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I didn't catch that.

502
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:01,212
[SPEAKER_09]: Obviously, I didn't do it.

503
00:41:02,092 --> 00:41:08,275
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so we're going to skip to the next one, which is the City Hall Council Chambers window restoration.

504
00:41:08,295 --> 00:41:14,999
[SPEAKER_09]: Pull that one up over here while I'm on the other side frantically.

505
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:20,102
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll be out in the future.

506
00:41:20,202 --> 00:41:22,383
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

507
00:41:23,583 --> 00:41:24,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk amongst yourselves.

508
00:41:24,724 --> 00:41:25,164
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

509
00:41:25,544 --> 00:41:32,888
[SPEAKER_02]: So any discussion about the presentation that we've just heard?

510
00:41:32,908 --> 00:41:37,150
[SPEAKER_11]: Seems very straightforward to me.

511
00:41:38,331 --> 00:41:43,414
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate that it was actually a clear plan and presentation, unlike the previous version.

512
00:41:44,375 --> 00:41:48,338
[SPEAKER_11]: I also liked the hard quote versus the soft quotes.

513
00:41:48,818 --> 00:41:49,138
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

514
00:41:50,359 --> 00:41:53,301
[SPEAKER_04]: I think he promised to do documentation before and after.

515
00:41:53,361 --> 00:41:56,082
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we should probably just put that in there and make sure that it's done.

516
00:41:56,102 --> 00:41:57,683
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

517
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:01,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Photographic documentation before and after for each window.

518
00:42:05,268 --> 00:42:06,769
[SPEAKER_04]: He was going to write it into the scope.

519
00:42:06,829 --> 00:42:10,432
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's going to add any money to the project, but it's important for

520
00:42:11,493 --> 00:42:21,239
[SPEAKER_04]: the historical record, especially of a building that is going to be slowly but surely renovated over the next few decades as it, as piece by piece, it just becomes functionally obsolete.

521
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:27,223
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's responsible for following up and trying to get City Hall in a historical district?

522
00:42:28,524 --> 00:42:30,345
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great question.

523
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:33,307
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been

524
00:42:35,147 --> 00:42:55,390
[SPEAKER_02]: offline trying to encourage a conversation about getting several historic, several, basically all of our past historic projects that aren't already either in a historic district or preservation restriction to have, to be put into historic districts.

525
00:42:56,091 --> 00:42:58,272
[SPEAKER_02]: and or have preservation restrictions.

526
00:42:58,792 --> 00:43:06,393
[SPEAKER_02]: The historic districts require coordination with our local historic district commission.

527
00:43:06,413 --> 00:43:19,276
[SPEAKER_02]: And that has been somewhat not fully functional for several months as they've been having a lot of turnover on the board.

528
00:43:19,645 --> 00:43:20,727
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not the one Doug's on.

529
00:43:21,147 --> 00:43:22,529
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not the one Doug's on.

530
00:43:22,749 --> 00:43:28,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Confusingly, we have two districts that have similar names, different functions.

531
00:43:28,828 --> 00:43:38,532
[SPEAKER_02]: The Historic District Commission has the responsibility to oversee local historic districts.

532
00:43:38,552 --> 00:43:43,014
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've been waiting for the opportunity to work with the Historic District Commission.

533
00:43:43,414 --> 00:43:52,918
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to see them create a local historic district that covers all of the city properties that we've funded so far and

534
00:43:55,360 --> 00:44:16,720
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, just for good measure, the Shiloh Baptist Church, and I'm trying to think if there are any other, I think that's the only privately owned property that's not already under a preservation restriction that we've, oh, and the, well, that's one of the city buildings, the ICCM.

535
00:44:18,598 --> 00:44:26,485
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they're, although I think that they're in a local historic district, so they do have some protection already.

536
00:44:28,326 --> 00:44:35,471
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think Shiloh is the only one that has no protection right now that we're trying to get some permanent protection for.

537
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:46,844
[SPEAKER_02]: So and that's really a matter we have been working on both routes of local historic district and preservation restriction.

538
00:44:46,864 --> 00:44:58,430
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just has taken time to get all of the legal work and planning in order to be able to make that happen.

539
00:44:58,450 --> 00:45:06,255
[SPEAKER_02]: So some some conditions that are drafted for

540
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:19,925
[SPEAKER_02]: um, the City Hall chamber windows restoration are that the City of Medford must seek to designate City Hall and a local historic district we were just talking about.

541
00:45:20,666 --> 00:45:32,376
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, Teresa's already added the suggested, um, recommendation from our discussion earlier that should the project extend beyond January 1, 2026,

542
00:45:33,973 --> 00:45:42,581
[SPEAKER_02]: The Facilities Department shall present at the February 2026 CPC meeting to give an update on timeline for completion.

543
00:45:44,543 --> 00:45:53,011
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as Doug has just suggested, the Facilities Department shall provide before and after photographs of the window restoration work.

544
00:45:54,252 --> 00:45:57,055
[SPEAKER_02]: Any tweaks to any of these?

545
00:45:58,152 --> 00:46:00,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Just one, I think seek is too weak.

546
00:46:00,894 --> 00:46:09,141
[SPEAKER_04]: They could send a letter to the historic district commission and it could not be answered in five years and they've seeked the district, but they need to actually get one done.

547
00:46:09,161 --> 00:46:14,245
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't need to put a date on it, but they need to have them actually do it, not just talk about it.

548
00:46:14,265 --> 00:46:20,529
[SPEAKER_05]: How about apply for, because actually getting it is not.

549
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:20,850
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

550
00:46:22,782 --> 00:46:25,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Apply for is with who, though?

551
00:46:25,424 --> 00:46:26,565
[SPEAKER_04]: The district commission?

552
00:46:26,585 --> 00:46:26,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

553
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:32,791
[SPEAKER_04]: To me, that's not different.

554
00:46:34,052 --> 00:46:35,013
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll get your point, though.

555
00:46:36,114 --> 00:46:39,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Must make an effort to designate because it's possible.

556
00:46:39,577 --> 00:46:45,662
[SPEAKER_02]: It does require a city council approval to place it in the district.

557
00:46:47,827 --> 00:46:50,249
[SPEAKER_02]: it could happen that they don't get the city council approval.

558
00:46:50,269 --> 00:46:56,413
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not going to make the city pay the CPC back for that.

559
00:46:56,793 --> 00:47:06,580
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not meant to be like the funding is taken away if you don't get a local historic district, but I just don't, if we don't- That's implied by condition though, I think.

560
00:47:07,521 --> 00:47:13,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's why we're making it a condition, but with a soft condition, not a hard condition.

561
00:47:14,261 --> 00:47:16,421
[SPEAKER_05]: How about must make substantial efforts?

562
00:47:16,521 --> 00:47:27,763
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that kind of does the like, we really mean it, but like, we don't actually want to write something where they fail and then we have to call our bluff and be like, yeah, you didn't do it, but we're not actually going to do anything about it.

563
00:47:27,783 --> 00:47:29,264
[SPEAKER_06]: I like it.

564
00:47:31,144 --> 00:47:38,025
[SPEAKER_05]: I realize it is up for interpretation, but it is up for less interpretation than efforts, which.

565
00:47:38,765 --> 00:47:38,985
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

566
00:47:40,906 --> 00:47:41,246
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

567
00:47:45,742 --> 00:47:49,523
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't hear you.

568
00:47:49,543 --> 00:47:53,084
[SPEAKER_06]: I was apologizing for my snark.

569
00:47:54,844 --> 00:47:56,665
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to be the one to make a motion.

570
00:47:56,685 --> 00:48:06,727
[SPEAKER_02]: I also wanted to suggest for number three, did you want to be more detailed about that, Doug?

571
00:48:14,028 --> 00:48:18,411
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd say you'd want overall and details.

572
00:48:19,091 --> 00:48:23,033
[SPEAKER_04]: They show details of one window or maybe two tonight.

573
00:48:23,533 --> 00:48:30,736
[SPEAKER_04]: That was good to show the condition, but you need to see the whole window before and after, and maybe a few close details.

574
00:48:30,856 --> 00:48:36,439
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a mix of overall and detailed photographs so that we can sense- Of each window.

575
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:37,940
[SPEAKER_04]: Of each window.

576
00:48:38,822 --> 00:48:47,268
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, basically, I think that's what we want to say to her so that, um, the facilities department shall provide before and after photographs of.

577
00:48:48,169 --> 00:48:51,011
[SPEAKER_02]: The window of restoration work for each window.

578
00:48:52,112 --> 00:48:53,793
[SPEAKER_02]: Showing overall and detail.

579
00:48:53,813 --> 00:48:57,476
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, uh, Teresa, isn't that just part of their final report?

580
00:48:57,516 --> 00:49:01,059
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what they said is, but, you know, but we want that in there.

581
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:01,459
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.

582
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:02,500
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

583
00:49:05,828 --> 00:49:12,572
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we need to put anything in about the work shall not impede the function of city hall and city council?

584
00:49:13,172 --> 00:49:17,755
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that's implied, but that seems like the sort of thing that we definitely want to be true.

585
00:49:21,256 --> 00:49:22,297
[SPEAKER_05]: Unnecessarily.

586
00:49:22,317 --> 00:49:22,397
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

587
00:49:26,132 --> 00:49:28,813
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you were saying that she'll not unnecessarily impede.

588
00:49:28,833 --> 00:49:29,954
[SPEAKER_04]: She didn't mean your comment.

589
00:49:29,974 --> 00:49:30,834
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not necessary to say.

590
00:49:30,914 --> 00:49:31,195
[SPEAKER_05]: Got it.

591
00:49:31,235 --> 00:49:32,395
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't mean your comment.

592
00:49:32,435 --> 00:49:35,757
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean she'll not unnecessarily impede.

593
00:49:36,097 --> 00:49:41,400
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the city council would have something to say about that.

594
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:42,300
[SPEAKER_04]: It's their room.

595
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:46,262
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to have a lot to say about when this happens and how it happens.

596
00:49:46,502 --> 00:49:48,063
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually don't think we need to.

597
00:49:48,984 --> 00:49:51,345
[SPEAKER_09]: The good thing is the work is done off-site.

598
00:49:51,605 --> 00:49:55,527
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to take the old windows out half a minute at a time and then put up

599
00:49:56,163 --> 00:50:03,248
[SPEAKER_09]: Presumably, I think old Bostonian has trademarked a plywood that they painted a faux window on.

600
00:50:03,448 --> 00:50:12,375
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that the restoration work itself shouldn't really impede the two hours that city council is in there.

601
00:50:14,210 --> 00:50:22,299
[SPEAKER_02]: They should paint an exterior view on the inside of the window.

602
00:50:22,339 --> 00:50:28,366
[SPEAKER_11]: We want to improve the funding if you don't make it pretty.

603
00:50:29,407 --> 00:50:33,031
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I think that it's probably

604
00:50:36,168 --> 00:50:44,956
[SPEAKER_02]: I get the impression that they're working on making sure, like working around city council as it is.

605
00:50:45,496 --> 00:50:48,759
[SPEAKER_09]: It's helpful that they only meet every other week.

606
00:50:48,799 --> 00:50:52,822
[SPEAKER_09]: They do have subcommittee meetings that they can, we'll be able to work around it.

607
00:50:53,983 --> 00:50:58,587
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but that reminded me of something else.

608
00:50:58,647 --> 00:50:59,468
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't think of it.

609
00:50:59,548 --> 00:51:00,509
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, yeah.

610
00:51:03,503 --> 00:51:07,949
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're ready to make a motion.

611
00:51:07,969 --> 00:51:14,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Does somebody want to make a motion?

612
00:51:16,179 --> 00:51:17,241
[SPEAKER_05]: I make a motion.

613
00:51:17,261 --> 00:51:21,506
[SPEAKER_02]: I second that.

614
00:51:23,433 --> 00:51:42,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, and the motion is to award $322,500 for the City Hall Council Chambers Window Restoration Project with the conditions of approval that the City of Medford will make substantial efforts to designate City Hall at a local historic district.

615
00:51:43,288 --> 00:51:48,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Should the project extend beyond January 1, 2026, the Facilities Department shall present

616
00:51:49,393 --> 00:51:54,437
[SPEAKER_02]: at the February 2026 CPC meeting to give an update on the timeline of completion.

617
00:51:55,057 --> 00:52:03,904
[SPEAKER_02]: And the facilities department shall provide before and after photographs of the window restoration work for each window demonstrating overall and detailed restoration.

618
00:52:04,905 --> 00:52:06,606
[SPEAKER_02]: So understood.

619
00:52:07,346 --> 00:52:09,048
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will call the roll.

620
00:52:10,028 --> 00:52:10,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Doug?

621
00:52:11,209 --> 00:52:11,609
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

622
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:12,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Joan?

623
00:52:13,491 --> 00:52:13,731
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

624
00:52:14,592 --> 00:52:14,852
[SPEAKER_12]: Ada?

625
00:52:15,052 --> 00:52:15,272
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

626
00:52:15,552 --> 00:52:15,853
[SPEAKER_12]: Ari?

627
00:52:17,314 --> 00:52:17,534
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

628
00:52:18,434 --> 00:52:18,795
[SPEAKER_12]: Kaylene?

629
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:19,840
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

630
00:52:20,681 --> 00:52:21,281
[SPEAKER_02]: Maisha?

631
00:52:22,102 --> 00:52:22,342
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

632
00:52:23,142 --> 00:52:24,083
[SPEAKER_02]: And myself, yes.

633
00:52:25,283 --> 00:52:26,824
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes unanimously.

634
00:52:26,864 --> 00:52:27,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you all.

635
00:52:27,545 --> 00:52:31,407
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have the Unitarian Universalist.

636
00:52:31,607 --> 00:52:33,248
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's go back to that.

637
00:52:33,948 --> 00:52:37,851
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

638
00:52:38,671 --> 00:52:41,153
[SPEAKER_08]: So just to show the overview here.

639
00:52:45,093 --> 00:53:01,826
[SPEAKER_02]: uh yes 99 000 and it was a one on the prioritization great so um Unitarian Universalist Church this is for exterior restoration siding of their building

640
00:53:03,647 --> 00:53:10,189
[SPEAKER_02]: And the conditions of approval are that the arrest rehabilitation shall comply with standards for rehabilitation stated in the U.S.

641
00:53:10,209 --> 00:53:17,410
[SPEAKER_02]: Secretary of Interior Standards for Treatment of Historic Properties codified in 3060FR part 68.

642
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:19,551
[SPEAKER_02]: That is very specific.

643
00:53:22,311 --> 00:53:29,273
[SPEAKER_02]: Per Kaplan versus Town of Acton, no CPA funds shall be used to restore any building features with religious imagery.

644
00:53:30,648 --> 00:53:38,454
[SPEAKER_02]: And a preservation restriction shall be placed on the property is this building in his local historic district.

645
00:53:39,094 --> 00:53:43,938
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this one just is on the outskirts of it, because the Osgoode house is not in.

646
00:53:44,458 --> 00:53:49,442
[SPEAKER_02]: A local historic district, I think, just right on the border so that's another one that should be.

647
00:53:50,307 --> 00:53:59,922
[SPEAKER_02]: So, when we get around to making local historic districts with all of the projects that we funded, that would be 1 to place in it.

648
00:54:00,903 --> 00:54:05,630
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there already a reservation restriction on this property from when we did the door?

649
00:54:08,021 --> 00:54:08,321
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

650
00:54:08,822 --> 00:54:12,763
[SPEAKER_02]: So first, we haven't actually gotten preservation restrictions yet.

651
00:54:12,783 --> 00:54:25,808
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the reasons it's taken so long for the Shiloh and ICCM is because it's in untested territory.

652
00:54:26,249 --> 00:54:29,630
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't done it before, so it takes a long time.

653
00:54:30,530 --> 00:54:36,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and we didn't ask them for it with the door project because it was such a small project.

654
00:54:36,571 --> 00:54:42,852
[SPEAKER_02]: Likewise, the, the Episcopal church across the street was also such a small project, but.

655
00:54:43,392 --> 00:54:45,893
[SPEAKER_09]: And the Osgoode house has a restriction on it.

656
00:54:46,053 --> 00:54:51,914
[SPEAKER_09]: So for the funding that CPA put in towards that building in the past, that's already has a protection in place.

657
00:54:52,034 --> 00:54:54,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

658
00:54:54,634 --> 00:54:58,295
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, that's why we haven't had it.

659
00:54:58,890 --> 00:55:12,515
[SPEAKER_02]: up to now, but for a large grant like this, and especially when we've had multiple grants on the same building, I think we should be making that requirement.

660
00:55:17,757 --> 00:55:24,299
[SPEAKER_02]: Would anyone like to make a motion to make the recommendation as we've just discussed?

661
00:55:24,639 --> 00:55:25,719
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to approve.

662
00:55:27,427 --> 00:55:29,527
[SPEAKER_08]: for the project of the Unitarian Church.

663
00:55:30,368 --> 00:55:30,668
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

664
00:55:31,168 --> 00:55:31,568
[SPEAKER_08]: Second?

665
00:55:34,268 --> 00:55:34,668
[SPEAKER_02]: Second.

666
00:55:36,309 --> 00:55:36,729
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

667
00:55:37,109 --> 00:55:38,569
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I will call the roll.

668
00:55:38,609 --> 00:55:38,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Doug?

669
00:55:39,829 --> 00:55:40,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

670
00:55:40,829 --> 00:55:41,209
[SPEAKER_02]: Joan?

671
00:55:41,970 --> 00:55:42,210
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

672
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:43,370
[SPEAKER_02]: Ada?

673
00:55:43,530 --> 00:55:43,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

674
00:55:44,370 --> 00:55:44,690
[SPEAKER_02]: Ari?

675
00:55:45,210 --> 00:55:45,450
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

676
00:55:46,290 --> 00:55:46,750
[SPEAKER_02]: Kaylene?

677
00:55:47,891 --> 00:55:48,131
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

678
00:55:49,031 --> 00:55:49,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Myesha?

679
00:55:50,531 --> 00:55:50,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

680
00:55:51,871 --> 00:55:52,731
[SPEAKER_02]: And myself, yes.

681
00:55:57,322 --> 00:55:58,523
[SPEAKER_02]: It's approved unanimously.

682
00:55:58,543 --> 00:56:01,625
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll move on to the next one.

683
00:56:01,645 --> 00:56:03,467
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a lot of projects on our list.

684
00:56:05,588 --> 00:56:11,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Randall, the Heckner Center, we're going to hold off until next week, although we should talk about that a little bit.

685
00:56:11,713 --> 00:56:19,519
[SPEAKER_02]: But we'll come back and talk about the Heckner Center after we get through the projects that we're going to make recommendations for.

686
00:56:19,539 --> 00:56:22,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Oak Grove Cemetery building restoration.

687
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:49,497
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so the request is for $85,000 to complete the planning for the Oak Grove Cemetery, the building restoration project at Oak Grove Cemetery.

688
00:56:51,439 --> 00:56:53,642
[SPEAKER_02]: And the conditions so far

689
00:56:55,134 --> 00:57:08,644
[SPEAKER_02]: are that all work completed must comply with the Secretary of Interior standards for the treatment of historic properties and that the City of Medford should make substantial efforts to place Oak Grove in.

690
00:57:08,844 --> 00:57:12,207
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to just let you finish reading before I launch editing, but yes.

691
00:57:18,012 --> 00:57:23,097
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to put some money that three years from now, none of these people have a local historic district on their building.

692
00:57:23,818 --> 00:57:30,785
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll take any impact on this thing.

693
00:57:30,965 --> 00:57:32,407
[SPEAKER_04]: No deadline, no results.

694
00:57:32,507 --> 00:57:35,110
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just the way it is with life.

695
00:57:36,651 --> 00:57:40,055
[SPEAKER_02]: At some point, I think, you know, like

696
00:57:41,525 --> 00:57:42,526
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

697
00:57:42,706 --> 00:57:44,987
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm hopeful with the new commission coming in.

698
00:57:45,747 --> 00:57:49,550
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it's a directive for me to help push this forward.

699
00:57:49,610 --> 00:57:52,391
[SPEAKER_09]: So I really hope it's not three years stuck.

700
00:57:54,893 --> 00:58:04,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Behind the scenes, Teresa is also becoming kind of the go-to resource person in City Hall to talk about in-store preservation.

701
00:58:04,993 --> 00:58:10,754
[SPEAKER_02]: So Teresa probably has some influence over putting it on their agenda.

702
00:58:10,774 --> 00:58:13,195
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a nice way of putting it, yeah.

703
00:58:13,275 --> 00:58:17,436
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just hard to put a condition when we don't have control over it.

704
00:58:17,536 --> 00:58:19,136
[SPEAKER_08]: We're voting on Elk Grove right now.

705
00:58:20,097 --> 00:58:22,077
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't even need it.

706
00:58:22,097 --> 00:58:22,657
[SPEAKER_08]: No, we don't.

707
00:58:22,697 --> 00:58:23,057
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

708
00:58:23,097 --> 00:58:24,418
[SPEAKER_08]: But you can watch if you wanted.

709
00:58:24,578 --> 00:58:26,238
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to get a kid on the wall.

710
00:58:26,598 --> 00:58:27,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, go ahead.

711
00:58:28,179 --> 00:58:32,200
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, the DPW commissioners poked his head in for a second as we're talking about his project.

712
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:32,740
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

713
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:33,860
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

714
00:58:34,972 --> 00:58:39,273
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, any other tweaks that we want to make to these conditions?

715
00:58:44,935 --> 00:58:53,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, would anyone like to make a motion to recommend funding $85,000 for Oak Grove Cemetery?

716
00:58:56,118 --> 00:58:56,999
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll make that motion.

717
00:58:58,059 --> 00:58:59,359
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

718
00:58:59,379 --> 00:58:59,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Second.

719
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:01,620
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard Anna first.

720
00:59:02,731 --> 00:59:04,232
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will call the roll.

721
00:59:04,252 --> 00:59:04,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Doug?

722
00:59:05,173 --> 00:59:05,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

723
00:59:06,234 --> 00:59:06,534
[SPEAKER_02]: Joan?

724
00:59:07,415 --> 00:59:07,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

725
00:59:08,495 --> 00:59:08,756
[SPEAKER_02]: Ada?

726
00:59:08,976 --> 00:59:09,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

727
00:59:09,396 --> 00:59:09,676
[SPEAKER_02]: Ari?

728
00:59:10,277 --> 00:59:10,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

729
00:59:11,197 --> 00:59:11,638
[SPEAKER_02]: Kaylene?

730
00:59:12,318 --> 00:59:12,578
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

731
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:13,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Myesha?

732
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:14,940
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

733
00:59:15,741 --> 00:59:16,782
[SPEAKER_02]: And myself, yes.

734
00:59:17,682 --> 00:59:18,903
[SPEAKER_02]: That one passes.

735
00:59:21,085 --> 00:59:25,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the next is Shiloh Baptist Church, ADA improvements.

736
00:59:30,801 --> 00:59:32,703
[SPEAKER_10]: give you a moment to bring that on the screen.

737
00:59:33,885 --> 00:59:36,888
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just kind of bouncing between that financial spreadsheet.

738
00:59:39,611 --> 00:59:51,185
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so the suggested conditions that we have drafted are that the rehabilitation shall comply with the standards for rehabilitation and Secretary of Interior standards.

739
00:59:52,988 --> 01:00:04,415
[SPEAKER_02]: Per Kaplan versus the Town of Acton, no CPA funds shall be used to restore any building features with religious imagery and a preservation restriction shall be placed on the property.

740
01:00:05,275 --> 01:00:14,581
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is, I think, just a repeat of the conditions that were used in previous grants that were given to Shiloh.

741
01:00:17,854 --> 01:00:23,219
[SPEAKER_02]: And are there any other, this is, it's been a while since we talked about this project.

742
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:30,386
[SPEAKER_02]: We had the presentation back in, I think, September.

743
01:00:31,126 --> 01:00:37,913
[SPEAKER_02]: So any discussion or suggestions for this project?

744
01:00:38,881 --> 01:00:40,702
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think we had any objections to it.

745
01:00:40,762 --> 01:00:44,704
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they came in off cycle, and we didn't feel it was appropriate to be off cycle.

746
01:00:44,944 --> 01:00:47,765
[SPEAKER_06]: So we asked them to submit during the cycle.

747
01:00:48,485 --> 01:00:51,807
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't believe we had any objections to the project itself.

748
01:00:53,208 --> 01:00:55,729
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

749
01:00:55,769 --> 01:01:03,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Would anyone like to make a motion to recommend $400,000 for the Shiloh Baptist Church Preservation Project?

750
01:01:04,473 --> 01:01:05,013
[SPEAKER_05]: I so move.

751
01:01:07,966 --> 01:01:08,747
[SPEAKER_02]: And second?

752
01:01:08,767 --> 01:01:09,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Second.

753
01:01:10,728 --> 01:01:13,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Ada seconded, then I will call the roll.

754
01:01:13,149 --> 01:01:13,450
[SPEAKER_02]: Doug?

755
01:01:14,250 --> 01:01:14,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

756
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:15,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Joan?

757
01:01:16,411 --> 01:01:16,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

758
01:01:17,472 --> 01:01:17,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Ada?

759
01:01:17,932 --> 01:01:18,173
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

760
01:01:18,453 --> 01:01:18,733
[SPEAKER_02]: Ari?

761
01:01:19,193 --> 01:01:19,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

762
01:01:20,134 --> 01:01:20,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Kaylene?

763
01:01:21,114 --> 01:01:21,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

764
01:01:22,075 --> 01:01:22,675
[SPEAKER_02]: Myesha?

765
01:01:23,496 --> 01:01:23,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

766
01:01:24,557 --> 01:01:25,517
[SPEAKER_02]: And myself, yes.

767
01:01:26,458 --> 01:01:34,283
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm hoping that there's future Shiloh Baptist Church grants, because that building still needs to do the work at the bottom.

768
01:01:36,543 --> 01:01:38,043
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, yes it does.

769
01:01:39,404 --> 01:01:52,288
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe that we will be pursuing, there's a lovely, wonderful, tailor-made grant program that is the Preservation of Historic Black Churches, I believe is the grant program name.

770
01:01:52,988 --> 01:01:54,388
[SPEAKER_09]: They will be applying for that this year.

771
01:01:54,408 --> 01:01:56,389
[SPEAKER_10]: That's great, thank you.

772
01:01:56,669 --> 01:02:01,350
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we're trying to find other, as you know, historic preservation grant money.

773
01:02:01,630 --> 01:02:03,651
[SPEAKER_08]: And did they receive that grant from the state?

774
01:02:04,296 --> 01:02:09,540
[SPEAKER_09]: They received a local grant from the community fund for $10,000.

775
01:02:10,281 --> 01:02:13,003
[SPEAKER_09]: So it wasn't a huge amount, but hey, it had a comma in it.

776
01:02:13,223 --> 01:02:13,504
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

777
01:02:13,724 --> 01:02:22,711
[SPEAKER_02]: And they should also be applying for a mass historic commission grant.

778
01:02:23,012 --> 01:02:23,152
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

779
01:02:25,389 --> 01:02:25,869
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.

780
01:02:26,650 --> 01:02:32,693
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, Roberta, but that grant is so competitive and you never know why you got or didn't.

781
01:02:33,253 --> 01:02:34,474
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure it's worth the effort.

782
01:02:35,714 --> 01:02:41,417
[SPEAKER_04]: We applied to InBelt for four times, we got one, never got another again, and we never knew why.

783
01:02:41,437 --> 01:02:50,482
[SPEAKER_09]: It's an option, but thank you for letting me know.

784
01:02:53,470 --> 01:02:55,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, hopefully we can find them.

785
01:02:55,171 --> 01:03:13,665
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would also, I would love to see and support them maybe even doing like a community campaign, GoFundMe or something for matching funds for the windows because we can't fund the

786
01:03:14,748 --> 01:03:16,668
[SPEAKER_02]: sections of their windows.

787
01:03:16,828 --> 01:03:23,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the windows have no religious imagery, they're just geometric shapes.

788
01:03:24,090 --> 01:03:30,491
[SPEAKER_02]: But the largest window panels have a few religious images in them.

789
01:03:31,492 --> 01:03:38,313
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really tough to draw the line of how much we have to stay away from those religious panels.

790
01:03:39,233 --> 01:03:41,915
[SPEAKER_02]: especially on the windows that most urgently need the work.

791
01:03:42,515 --> 01:03:49,920
[SPEAKER_02]: So it would be great to help them with a community fundraiser to raise some not public funds.

792
01:03:50,341 --> 01:03:56,325
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have actually set up an account that we have posters that we can put up.

793
01:03:56,345 --> 01:04:02,309
[SPEAKER_02]: They've set up an account where they can receive funds directly to a fund just to

794
01:04:04,721 --> 01:04:27,456
[SPEAKER_02]: preserve their windows right but we haven't done they haven't done much with it and um beef up some outreach yeah so would love to get some ideas about how to help them raise some private money not public money to help with their project too so moving on the medford affordable housing trust 250 000 um

795
01:04:34,419 --> 01:04:42,386
[SPEAKER_02]: to basically cede money to begin getting the Affordable Housing Trust off the ground.

796
01:04:42,406 --> 01:04:55,778
[SPEAKER_02]: The suggested conditions in our draft are that the Affordable Housing Trust will submit quarterly reporting to the CPC that outlines how CPA funding will be allocated.

797
01:04:57,351 --> 01:05:03,675
[SPEAKER_02]: and that expenditures must be reviewed for compliance by the Community Preservation Act manager prior to commitment.

798
01:05:03,695 --> 01:05:06,336
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely agree with the second one.

799
01:05:06,416 --> 01:05:20,103
[SPEAKER_02]: The first one, I wonder whether annual reporting would be sufficient because I don't know, especially in the beginning, how frequently the trust is going to be being able to have anything to report.

800
01:05:20,123 --> 01:05:20,183
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

801
01:05:20,223 --> 01:05:20,563
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

802
01:05:20,683 --> 01:05:22,004
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

803
01:05:23,265 --> 01:05:24,265
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I was thinking the same.

804
01:05:24,425 --> 01:05:25,826
[SPEAKER_07]: It might feel burdensome in the beginning.

805
01:05:26,583 --> 01:05:26,823
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

806
01:05:28,323 --> 01:05:31,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Haley, this is your area of expertise.

807
01:05:31,924 --> 01:05:34,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have faith in the housing trust?

808
01:05:34,565 --> 01:05:35,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know these folks?

809
01:05:35,505 --> 01:05:39,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you feel positive about the people on there and the direction they're going?

810
01:05:40,646 --> 01:05:43,447
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually have no idea who's on the housing trust.

811
01:05:44,087 --> 01:05:48,288
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I mean, the only introduction I had was when they came and presented.

812
01:05:50,349 --> 01:05:52,089
[SPEAKER_04]: So who's really plugged in?

813
01:05:52,149 --> 01:05:52,849
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no idea.

814
01:05:53,029 --> 01:05:53,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Is anybody?

815
01:05:54,049 --> 01:05:54,470
[SPEAKER_04]: Teresa?

816
01:05:55,290 --> 01:05:55,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Joe?

817
01:05:55,730 --> 01:05:56,110
[SPEAKER_04]: Roberta?

818
01:05:57,333 --> 01:05:58,334
[SPEAKER_02]: I serve on the trust.

819
01:05:59,035 --> 01:05:59,135
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

820
01:05:59,195 --> 01:06:00,636
[SPEAKER_02]: I serve on the trust.

821
01:06:01,057 --> 01:06:01,377
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

822
01:06:01,477 --> 01:06:03,239
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that kind of says everything I need to know then.

823
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:07,583
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so we are voting down, right?

824
01:06:07,643 --> 01:06:08,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you're not.

825
01:06:08,363 --> 01:06:11,606
[SPEAKER_04]: We're taking all that money and giving it away for anyone.

826
01:06:14,589 --> 01:06:15,390
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there you go.

827
01:06:16,491 --> 01:06:17,972
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think they know what they're doing.

828
01:06:18,152 --> 01:06:20,954
[SPEAKER_02]: But I can't, just because we do have that precedent, so yeah.

829
01:06:25,085 --> 01:06:29,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to follow precedent, I will, but I don't have to.

830
01:06:29,788 --> 01:06:34,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the housing trust is actually filled with some great people.

831
01:06:34,711 --> 01:06:47,458
[SPEAKER_02]: I really look forward to having some money to be able to quit toward projects and use the brain trust that is on the trust.

832
01:06:49,735 --> 01:07:00,886
[SPEAKER_06]: So, in your in your take your CPA hat off and put your housing trust hat on is two hundred and fifty thousand dollars enough to get you guys started.

833
01:07:01,787 --> 01:07:04,030
[SPEAKER_06]: You mean two point five million.

834
01:07:06,675 --> 01:07:06,815
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

835
01:07:06,915 --> 01:07:09,296
[SPEAKER_06]: $25 million would be a good start.

836
01:07:10,016 --> 01:07:10,877
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I said $250,000, right?

837
01:07:10,897 --> 01:07:11,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know.

838
01:07:11,557 --> 01:07:17,979
[SPEAKER_06]: She was making a joke there, Joan.

839
01:07:18,439 --> 01:07:19,200
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I get it.

840
01:07:19,540 --> 01:07:21,160
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm clarifying.

841
01:07:21,180 --> 01:07:21,701
[SPEAKER_06]: No, $250,000.

842
01:07:21,741 --> 01:07:22,701
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

843
01:07:22,741 --> 01:07:24,942
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's less than one unit, right?

844
01:07:25,002 --> 01:07:27,863
[SPEAKER_04]: If you would build that, that's less than one unit, right?

845
01:07:27,883 --> 01:07:35,826
[SPEAKER_04]: So the seed money is to accelerate bigger projects more, like the 100-unit buildings, those kind of things.

846
01:07:36,683 --> 01:07:45,149
[SPEAKER_11]: I think this was part of our discussion when they came was like, we want them to be able to form a plan around how they will generate more money.

847
01:07:45,169 --> 01:07:45,269
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

848
01:07:46,790 --> 01:07:47,590
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause we all agree.

849
01:07:47,610 --> 01:07:48,931
[SPEAKER_11]: This is kind of like nothing.

850
01:07:48,951 --> 01:07:49,412
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

851
01:07:52,254 --> 01:07:52,534
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

852
01:07:52,914 --> 01:07:56,476
[SPEAKER_02]: That's exactly what she said.

853
01:07:56,496 --> 01:07:57,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it.

854
01:07:59,460 --> 01:08:09,106
[SPEAKER_02]: more money, generating more money and having a plan for how to spend the money is the first thing that the trust is working on.

855
01:08:09,906 --> 01:08:20,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, one of the things that could help us to generate more money would be to update our linkage ordinance.

856
01:08:20,772 --> 01:08:23,514
[SPEAKER_02]: And that requires an expensive study.

857
01:08:23,534 --> 01:08:28,757
[SPEAKER_02]: And that expensive study is not eligible for CPA funding.

858
01:08:29,336 --> 01:08:34,317
[SPEAKER_02]: And we haven't identified a funding source to complete that study.

859
01:08:34,458 --> 01:08:39,419
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one of the barriers to finding more funding.

860
01:08:39,859 --> 01:08:48,722
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, that they're going to be working on shaking out the couch cushions for change.

861
01:08:48,982 --> 01:08:49,322
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

862
01:08:49,462 --> 01:08:49,802
[SPEAKER_08]: So

863
01:08:55,690 --> 01:09:24,866
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be that if we have additional funds in the bank that the CPC could award more than $250,000 for the Affordable Housing Trust, or it might be that the CPC would prefer to keep additional extra money in the bank and have money to respond to off-cycle requests should any come in, including an off-cycle request for affordable housing.

864
01:09:25,883 --> 01:09:30,967
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would leave that for discussion.

865
01:09:30,987 --> 01:09:37,091
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there's a whole lot of what we don't know.

866
01:09:37,292 --> 01:09:40,554
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe we start where we start and see how it goes.

867
01:09:41,915 --> 01:09:42,856
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think that.

868
01:09:43,852 --> 01:09:52,115
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever our visions for the future, visions and dreams, I think right now it's a new unknown entity.

869
01:09:52,495 --> 01:09:54,456
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the amount they asked for.

870
01:09:54,576 --> 01:09:57,477
[SPEAKER_05]: We are very happy to give it as a place to start.

871
01:09:58,597 --> 01:10:03,359
[SPEAKER_05]: And we are very happy to continue supporting them with kind of trust but verify.

872
01:10:03,519 --> 01:10:08,480
[SPEAKER_05]: And as that relationship grows, the default funding amount may increase.

873
01:10:08,601 --> 01:10:12,702
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think right now, let's go project by project.

874
01:10:17,228 --> 01:10:18,068
[SPEAKER_02]: That's reasonable.

875
01:10:18,129 --> 01:10:19,309
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to vote.

876
01:10:20,711 --> 01:10:28,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to award $250,000 to the Medford Affordable Housing Trust from Ada.

877
01:10:28,897 --> 01:10:29,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Second?

878
01:10:32,119 --> 01:10:32,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Second.

879
01:10:35,142 --> 01:10:36,163
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will call the roll.

880
01:10:36,203 --> 01:10:36,503
[SPEAKER_02]: Doug?

881
01:10:38,064 --> 01:10:38,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

882
01:10:38,604 --> 01:10:38,945
[SPEAKER_02]: Joan?

883
01:10:39,725 --> 01:10:40,025
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

884
01:10:40,866 --> 01:10:41,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Ada?

885
01:10:41,327 --> 01:10:41,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

886
01:10:42,007 --> 01:10:42,187
[SPEAKER_02]: Ari?

887
01:10:42,227 --> 01:10:42,287
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

888
01:10:44,913 --> 01:10:45,153
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

889
01:10:45,894 --> 01:10:46,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Maisha?

890
01:10:47,355 --> 01:10:47,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

891
01:10:48,736 --> 01:10:51,217
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will abstain.

892
01:10:55,180 --> 01:10:56,300
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

893
01:10:57,001 --> 01:11:02,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we have one more project to discuss, ABCD's Medford move-in program for $99,989.

894
01:11:04,866 --> 01:11:08,308
[SPEAKER_02]: You sure you just told them to round up?

895
01:11:16,092 --> 01:11:18,453
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if it's going to drive me nuts from looking at you 89.

896
01:11:19,294 --> 01:11:21,855
[SPEAKER_11]: It's unique.

897
01:11:23,376 --> 01:11:24,557
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

898
01:11:27,339 --> 01:11:28,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Discussion about this.

899
01:11:28,299 --> 01:11:35,444
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a draft condition, ABCD to partner with Medford House of Authority to establish regular cadence of promoting the program.

900
01:11:36,104 --> 01:11:41,627
[SPEAKER_02]: The CPC recommends quarterly email communications with MHA's tenant services team.

901
01:11:41,647 --> 01:11:45,870
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we've also in the past required and have

902
01:11:46,210 --> 01:11:54,272
[SPEAKER_02]: wouldn't hurt to continue to require that ABCD makes quarterly reports to this.

903
01:11:54,552 --> 01:11:56,833
[SPEAKER_02]: That's in our- It's in the grant.

904
01:11:56,953 --> 01:11:59,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, maybe I need to put it here then.

905
01:11:59,174 --> 01:12:11,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you all feel like this is an appropriate requirement condition to put on the grant or is this overreaching?

906
01:12:11,937 --> 01:12:14,258
[SPEAKER_05]: To me- It's incredibly reasonable, sorry.

907
01:12:14,682 --> 01:12:15,182
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't mean to.

908
01:12:15,342 --> 01:12:27,770
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going to say to me, it feels micromanaging and it reflects that we didn't really trust the level of, uh, communication that was happening.

909
01:12:27,830 --> 01:12:31,312
[SPEAKER_11]: So it feels a little icky to me, but not necessarily our fault.

910
01:12:32,172 --> 01:12:33,953
[SPEAKER_11]: That's how it raised to me.

911
01:12:34,013 --> 01:12:41,298
[SPEAKER_09]: They do have, there has been a fair amount of turnover on the ABCD side.

912
01:12:41,358 --> 01:12:41,438
[SPEAKER_09]: So.

913
01:12:42,265 --> 01:12:50,394
[SPEAKER_09]: I kind of like having this in a static document rather than, hey, Bob, Jill, you know.

914
01:12:50,474 --> 01:12:51,275
[SPEAKER_09]: That's good context.

915
01:12:51,295 --> 01:12:53,397
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, it does feel a little micromanaging.

916
01:12:53,497 --> 01:12:53,838
[SPEAKER_05]: It does.

917
01:12:55,299 --> 01:12:58,243
[SPEAKER_05]: But also, it comes from a place of that not having been done.

918
01:12:59,117 --> 01:12:59,397
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

919
01:12:59,677 --> 01:13:04,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, and they've gotten this grant for multiple years, and it seems like they aren't using all the money.

920
01:13:04,901 --> 01:13:07,323
[SPEAKER_05]: And we know there's a huge need.

921
01:13:07,683 --> 01:13:11,225
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is coming from a place of trust, but verify, OK, you didn't do it.

922
01:13:11,266 --> 01:13:14,428
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we're going to tell you the thing that, like, actually, we do need you to do.

923
01:13:15,348 --> 01:13:18,390
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't think they're theoretically opposed to outreach.

924
01:13:18,471 --> 01:13:23,954
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they are people who are very committed to what they do and are deeply under-resourced.

925
01:13:24,255 --> 01:13:27,517
[SPEAKER_05]: So hopefully making something very clear

926
01:13:28,212 --> 01:13:30,173
[SPEAKER_05]: will be mutually beneficial.

927
01:13:31,453 --> 01:13:39,997
[SPEAKER_09]: And also just to add in their application, they had said that a portion of these funds would go towards marketing and outreach on that.

928
01:13:40,037 --> 01:13:45,040
[SPEAKER_09]: So it kind of aligns with they're asking for more money to do this.

929
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:48,341
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're just saying, well, great, please make sure you're doing this as well.

930
01:13:49,902 --> 01:13:51,783
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, it's a little sticky.

931
01:13:52,183 --> 01:13:52,323
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

932
01:13:54,193 --> 01:14:00,397
[SPEAKER_02]: Hayley and Howard, sorry to catch you midway.

933
01:14:01,037 --> 01:14:05,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any thoughts about this condition and its

934
01:14:08,886 --> 01:14:10,348
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I think it's good.

935
01:14:11,348 --> 01:14:12,009
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's reasonable.

936
01:14:12,369 --> 01:14:25,701
[SPEAKER_07]: After we had that discussion, or after they presented, I was just like, my mind was spinning when she said that she had not connected with Medford Housing, and they did not, I don't know, it just seems like such a resource for them to use the money.

937
01:14:26,462 --> 01:14:27,323
[SPEAKER_07]: That was another red flag.

938
01:14:27,363 --> 01:14:28,644
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, why are you having to use all your money?

939
01:14:29,205 --> 01:14:34,389
[SPEAKER_07]: So we had a board meeting, and I asked one of the directors about it.

940
01:14:36,567 --> 01:14:42,129
[SPEAKER_07]: without like in so many words, she just said, yeah, communication with them was very lacking and difficult.

941
01:14:42,269 --> 01:14:43,850
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it's good.

942
01:14:44,230 --> 01:14:45,931
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this is a good condition of approval.

943
01:14:46,091 --> 01:14:54,054
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully they'll set up a good, you know, line of communication and be able to use the money, you know, with the tenants.

944
01:14:54,074 --> 01:14:57,255
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause I mean, they have a lot of non-payment of rent issues over there.

945
01:14:57,715 --> 01:14:57,935
[SPEAKER_07]: So.

946
01:14:59,396 --> 01:14:59,756
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

947
01:14:59,776 --> 01:15:01,056
[SPEAKER_02]: That is really helpful input.

948
01:15:02,657 --> 01:15:02,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Um,

949
01:15:04,863 --> 01:15:05,183
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

950
01:15:05,243 --> 01:15:10,886
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do appreciate that since we've started partnering with ABCD, they have increased their footprint in Bafford.

951
01:15:11,486 --> 01:15:18,490
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's been an incremental and slow increase, but it's really promising to see.

952
01:15:18,510 --> 01:15:20,191
[SPEAKER_09]: It's moving in the right direction.

953
01:15:20,791 --> 01:15:23,192
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's a great program and has such great potential.

954
01:15:23,252 --> 01:15:26,594
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think this little condition will definitely jumpstart it even more.

955
01:15:29,439 --> 01:15:29,719
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

956
01:15:29,759 --> 01:15:33,820
[SPEAKER_02]: So is there a motion to recommend $99,989 to the, we could round it up if we wanted.

957
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:34,321
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have to.

958
01:15:34,381 --> 01:15:34,801
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't pay $89.

959
01:15:34,881 --> 01:15:35,321
[SPEAKER_02]: $99,999 and 99 cents.

960
01:15:57,027 --> 01:15:58,328
[SPEAKER_04]: Give me an extra $11.

961
01:15:58,468 --> 01:16:04,012
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, let's change that to $100,000 and be done with it.

962
01:16:05,073 --> 01:16:16,722
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so is there a motion to recommend $100,000 to the ABCD for the Medford move-in program with the condition that had been drafted?

963
01:16:18,403 --> 01:16:19,364
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll make that motion.

964
01:16:21,346 --> 01:16:22,006
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll second.

965
01:16:24,168 --> 01:16:25,649
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard Ari first.

966
01:16:26,986 --> 01:16:28,328
[SPEAKER_02]: Then, so I'll call the roll.

967
01:16:28,348 --> 01:16:28,628
[SPEAKER_02]: Doug?

968
01:16:29,129 --> 01:16:29,429
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

969
01:16:30,110 --> 01:16:30,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Joan?

970
01:16:31,252 --> 01:16:31,572
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

971
01:16:32,413 --> 01:16:32,694
[SPEAKER_02]: Ada?

972
01:16:32,834 --> 01:16:33,054
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

973
01:16:33,335 --> 01:16:33,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Ari?

974
01:16:34,056 --> 01:16:34,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

975
01:16:35,037 --> 01:16:35,498
[SPEAKER_02]: Kaylene?

976
01:16:36,098 --> 01:16:36,319
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

977
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:37,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Myesha?

978
01:16:38,642 --> 01:16:38,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

979
01:16:39,723 --> 01:16:40,525
[SPEAKER_02]: And myself, yes.

980
01:16:41,897 --> 01:16:47,038
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so that is all of the projects that are on the slate for this evening.

981
01:16:47,078 --> 01:16:49,919
[SPEAKER_02]: We did it, everybody.

982
01:16:50,919 --> 01:16:51,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Congratulations.

983
01:16:52,280 --> 01:17:02,163
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's go back to the Hegner Center just to have the official update on Hegner Center.

984
01:17:03,003 --> 01:17:07,024
[SPEAKER_09]: So I alluded to this in the email, but just to discuss it in public meeting here,

985
01:17:08,083 --> 01:17:17,950
[SPEAKER_09]: The planning team that has been pulled together on this project involves our facilities director, our health department, communications, as well as our planning director.

986
01:17:18,991 --> 01:17:24,655
[SPEAKER_09]: They recognize that there should be a little bit more tweaking and finalizing of this plan.

987
01:17:26,116 --> 01:17:29,359
[SPEAKER_09]: So they have asked if we could pause our consideration.

988
01:17:29,419 --> 01:17:32,181
[SPEAKER_09]: They are not requesting to withdraw the application.

989
01:17:32,863 --> 01:17:53,192
[SPEAKER_09]: but they recognize that we're in the middle of our funding cycle and they're asking for a considerable amount of money, but they have asked for the professional courtesy if we could pause on the vote for them to meet once more internally to kind of finalize and firm up the plan as to what they're gonna tackle first at the Eggner Center.

990
01:17:54,272 --> 01:18:01,956
[SPEAKER_09]: If you recall from their presentation, they were pretty transparent about there needs to be a lot of work done at this property.

991
01:18:03,062 --> 01:18:06,284
[SPEAKER_09]: effectively abandoned for a better part of 10 years.

992
01:18:07,205 --> 01:18:14,929
[SPEAKER_09]: So they just essentially have asked if they can get their ducks in a row internally and then come back to this committee for consideration.

993
01:18:14,949 --> 01:18:17,851
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that very much.

994
01:18:17,871 --> 01:18:23,915
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I always think that projects go better when they have more planning.

995
01:18:25,646 --> 01:18:34,672
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also was saying earlier before we started, but I'll repeat again that I've seen projects that follow the model of

996
01:18:36,373 --> 01:18:49,942
[SPEAKER_02]: um, doing work incrementally without necessarily, um, having all the details worked out in from the beginning, but they, um, they tackle pieces of a project.

997
01:18:50,883 --> 01:18:57,968
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, um, and ultimately end up over the course of a few years getting really significant things done.

998
01:18:58,108 --> 01:19:05,393
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, that approach works for me, but I do appreciate they're putting some more, um, effort into.

999
01:19:06,293 --> 01:19:10,875
[SPEAKER_02]: the vision before requesting funding from us.

1000
01:19:11,155 --> 01:19:11,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Doug.

1001
01:19:13,176 --> 01:19:21,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Does this turn this into an off-cycle that's going to happen in January, or is it going to make it under the radar of the city council?

1002
01:19:22,759 --> 01:19:32,423
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's going to be like some of the projects that we've done in previous years where we ended up making recommendations over successive meetings.

1003
01:19:33,603 --> 01:19:41,189
[SPEAKER_02]: based on when the applicants were able to give us all of the information that we needed to arrive at our decisions.

1004
01:19:41,209 --> 01:19:42,910
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is going to be one of those.

1005
01:19:43,130 --> 01:19:44,711
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just going to be held over.

1006
01:19:45,172 --> 01:19:53,498
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not really off cycle because they submitted the application during the regular cycle, but we're just going to have a holdover decision in January.

1007
01:19:54,242 --> 01:19:55,703
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're part of the 2.37, right?

1008
01:19:55,883 --> 01:19:59,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's that number, right?

1009
01:19:59,205 --> 01:20:03,708
[SPEAKER_04]: So we still have 350 that we're not using, which is fine.

1010
01:20:03,728 --> 01:20:09,852
[SPEAKER_04]: I love having the ability to fund anything down the road that may come up, whether it's affordable housing, anything.

1011
01:20:10,552 --> 01:20:12,974
[SPEAKER_04]: So it sounds like we're in good shape on that front.

1012
01:20:13,114 --> 01:20:14,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that a correct statement?

1013
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:17,136
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1014
01:20:20,518 --> 01:20:20,879
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1015
01:20:24,753 --> 01:20:31,536
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's good that they shore up their vision, at least from where I'm sitting.

1016
01:20:31,556 --> 01:20:35,598
[SPEAKER_11]: I did have one more thought about the ABCD thing.

1017
01:20:35,638 --> 01:20:38,740
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if anyone else has Hegner thoughts.

1018
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:50,185
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess, since I haven't been here for a full year, I guess I'm not sure what our meetings for the rest of the year will involve.

1019
01:20:51,053 --> 01:21:03,797
[SPEAKER_11]: But I wonder whether we'd want ABCD to come meet with us again at some point mid-year so we can just like, I know that kind of goes against what I said about micromanaging, but like.

1020
01:21:03,817 --> 01:21:05,498
[SPEAKER_11]: Touchpoint.

1021
01:21:05,678 --> 01:21:08,979
[SPEAKER_11]: Touchpoint, like, I don't know.

1022
01:21:09,199 --> 01:21:10,780
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that something that you guys have done before?

1023
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:12,841
[SPEAKER_02]: It is, yeah.

1024
01:21:13,021 --> 01:21:17,782
[SPEAKER_02]: We've asked for updates from grantees.

1025
01:21:21,384 --> 01:21:25,587
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, when, when we feel like we need to know what's going on with the project.

1026
01:21:25,767 --> 01:21:27,309
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that that's fair.

1027
01:21:27,729 --> 01:21:36,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, just requesting periodic reporting from them is something did we add that to the ABCD?

1028
01:21:37,757 --> 01:21:40,819
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but we talked about how it's already in there.

1029
01:21:40,899 --> 01:21:45,903
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll ask for the reporting to be something I can share it to us.

1030
01:21:46,264 --> 01:21:49,066
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's something so I'm in the meeting packet.

1031
01:21:50,708 --> 01:21:56,772
[SPEAKER_02]: was the agenda calendar for the year.

1032
01:21:56,792 --> 01:22:05,676
[SPEAKER_02]: So at our next meeting, I mean, this so this is an agenda calendar that shows what we've done all of this past year.

1033
01:22:06,236 --> 01:22:11,899
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's essentially what the year looks like every year.

1034
01:22:11,919 --> 01:22:16,542
[SPEAKER_02]: And so more or less, this is their

1035
01:22:17,210 --> 01:22:33,739
[SPEAKER_02]: times in the agenda or times during the year when we have room for looking at specific projects to see how they're going or talking about certain issues that we want to work out how to do.

1036
01:22:34,359 --> 01:22:42,923
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can maybe drop that into the agenda later in the year to talk about ABCD.

1037
01:22:43,023 --> 01:22:44,944
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's an opportunity because in

1038
01:22:46,683 --> 01:22:57,335
[SPEAKER_02]: May or June, the Affordable Housing Trust is going to be delivering, aim to deliver their action plan.

1039
01:22:57,935 --> 01:23:05,323
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe that would be a time to also talk about some other housing issues at a meeting over the summer, maybe June or July.

1040
01:23:05,944 --> 01:23:08,887
[SPEAKER_09]: And maybe we can cycle it throughout the year where we're not just

1041
01:23:10,285 --> 01:23:23,852
[SPEAKER_09]: singling out one grant applicant we can be like okay well maybe we focus on housing in the spring and then over the summer we have Amanda come back to talk about park project updates or you know you can kind of sprinkle that in throughout the year.

1042
01:23:24,272 --> 01:23:25,493
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that what might be a nice thing.

1043
01:23:25,593 --> 01:23:28,295
[SPEAKER_09]: I love that.

1044
01:23:28,795 --> 01:23:34,618
[SPEAKER_09]: I give very brief updates to this committee it might be nice to hear right from the horse's mouth right right Joan I cut you off.

1045
01:23:35,421 --> 01:23:35,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Love it.

1046
01:23:36,021 --> 01:23:37,082
[SPEAKER_06]: I love that idea.

1047
01:23:37,142 --> 01:23:43,343
[SPEAKER_06]: My first person I want to see is that housing development over on the Fellsway.

1048
01:23:43,363 --> 01:23:47,465
[SPEAKER_06]: I like to call it that rock ledge place.

1049
01:23:47,565 --> 01:23:50,265
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that Manford?

1050
01:23:51,366 --> 01:23:51,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1051
01:23:51,766 --> 01:23:52,166
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1052
01:23:53,346 --> 01:23:53,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1053
01:23:54,187 --> 01:23:57,868
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a project that we put a lot of CPA funding into.

1054
01:23:57,968 --> 01:23:59,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, maybe I didn't think about that.

1055
01:24:00,028 --> 01:24:01,249
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

1056
01:24:01,289 --> 01:24:03,510
[SPEAKER_06]: Not West Medford, not West Medford.

1057
01:24:03,810 --> 01:24:08,293
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's on the corner of like, on the ground.

1058
01:24:09,574 --> 01:24:12,336
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a rock quarry on Winthrop Street.

1059
01:24:12,356 --> 01:24:14,997
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the high school.

1060
01:24:15,798 --> 01:24:16,098
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

1061
01:24:16,198 --> 01:24:21,662
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we can look at as we're fleshing out the agenda for next coming year.

1062
01:24:21,682 --> 01:24:23,223
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll just sprinkle that in.

1063
01:24:23,563 --> 01:24:23,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1064
01:24:26,405 --> 01:24:27,287
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, that'd be great.

1065
01:24:27,427 --> 01:24:33,217
[SPEAKER_09]: So the next item on the agenda is meeting minutes, which I failed to get those done.

1066
01:24:33,557 --> 01:24:36,823
[SPEAKER_09]: So I look forward to providing them to you next meeting.

1067
01:24:36,843 --> 01:24:37,944
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1068
01:24:38,285 --> 01:24:38,766
[SPEAKER_02]: So that.

1069
01:24:39,303 --> 01:24:39,723
[SPEAKER_02]: That's quick.

1070
01:24:39,763 --> 01:24:43,185
[SPEAKER_02]: How about a debrief of the winter extravaganza tabling?

1071
01:24:43,425 --> 01:24:44,605
[SPEAKER_09]: It just is a really quick thing.

1072
01:24:44,805 --> 01:24:48,767
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, last Wednesday we had the winter extravaganza here at city hall.

1073
01:24:49,167 --> 01:24:53,629
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I was outside tabling, had some really great conversations with folks.

1074
01:24:54,469 --> 01:24:58,130
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, one that I wanted to bring back to the affordable housing trust.

1075
01:24:59,071 --> 01:25:05,173
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I had a very good conversation with a resident who has a, she's a voucher holder.

1076
01:25:05,777 --> 01:25:23,533
[SPEAKER_09]: issued out of Medford here, and she had a suggestion of could we look into funding a program that brings back the rent to own under the affordable housing umbrella, which I believe that there was something in the latest housing bill that kind of addressed that.

1077
01:25:23,553 --> 01:25:29,438
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't quite dug into it yet, but I thought that that was an interesting concept of

1078
01:25:30,445 --> 01:25:38,051
[SPEAKER_09]: of getting folks, income-eligible folks, into ownership opportunities rather than trapping them in the rental.

1079
01:25:40,152 --> 01:25:42,674
[SPEAKER_09]: But other than that, it was a lot of families.

1080
01:25:42,734 --> 01:25:46,157
[SPEAKER_09]: We had a lot of requests for more park projects, updates.

1081
01:25:47,058 --> 01:25:51,061
[SPEAKER_09]: Barrie Park was mentioned several times, several times.

1082
01:25:51,141 --> 01:25:54,423
[SPEAKER_09]: So we should probably keep an eye out for Barrie Park for the next funding cycle.

1083
01:25:54,503 --> 01:25:55,384
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty crummy.

1084
01:25:55,684 --> 01:25:56,885
[SPEAKER_09]: It's in love.

1085
01:25:57,105 --> 01:25:57,446
[SPEAKER_09]: It does.

1086
01:25:59,852 --> 01:26:09,059
[SPEAKER_09]: But yes, so just as a quick debrief, what I kind of like is this was the first time in a long time where there was a lot of CPA name recognition.

1087
01:26:10,140 --> 01:26:12,742
[SPEAKER_09]: Usually I have to explain to people what it is.

1088
01:26:12,802 --> 01:26:15,204
[SPEAKER_09]: And a lot of people are like, oh no, I know exactly all about that.

1089
01:26:16,205 --> 01:26:17,766
[SPEAKER_09]: So that was kind of a nice thing.

1090
01:26:17,826 --> 01:26:19,407
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's working folks.

1091
01:26:19,467 --> 01:26:21,509
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you for all the outreach that you're doing.

1092
01:26:21,529 --> 01:26:24,091
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I said, just a quick update.

1093
01:26:24,131 --> 01:26:25,532
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to share that with the,

1094
01:26:26,765 --> 01:26:30,846
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, sometimes after the tabling events, you're like, oh, I just talked to a thousand people and you're tired.

1095
01:26:30,906 --> 01:26:36,048
[SPEAKER_09]: But this one afterwards, even though it was freezing, I was like, oh, wow, that was incredibly successful.

1096
01:26:36,108 --> 01:26:36,608
[SPEAKER_09]: So cold.

1097
01:26:37,188 --> 01:26:39,408
[SPEAKER_09]: I was handing out little hand warmers to everybody.

1098
01:26:39,789 --> 01:26:41,169
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that that was really helpful.

1099
01:26:41,189 --> 01:26:42,909
[SPEAKER_09]: You were literally outside the building?

1100
01:26:43,329 --> 01:26:45,610
[SPEAKER_09]: You were outside?

1101
01:26:45,750 --> 01:26:48,271
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, the vendors and everything set up outside.

1102
01:26:48,591 --> 01:26:56,053
[SPEAKER_11]: It makes me wonder, in addition to all the tabling opportunities, do we have CPA events where it's like, come to

1103
01:26:56,542 --> 01:27:09,169
[SPEAKER_11]: and like not so much like we go to your events, but like come to like, let's do a meet and greet at like the beer hall or like a town hall, or like not a town hall, but like get the room at the library and have people come like learn about what it is, like that kind of thing.

1104
01:27:09,429 --> 01:27:21,696
[SPEAKER_09]: We've done, I've done a couple events at the library where it's not so much a room rental, it's more tabling, but rather than being part of another event where standalone, we've done a couple of those with mixed,

1105
01:27:23,387 --> 01:27:32,632
[SPEAKER_09]: I wouldn't say that it's as effective just because the foot traffic is so low, but I hear what you're saying about we can advertise an event out and have like a Q&A type of a thing.

1106
01:27:34,593 --> 01:27:35,914
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I love that idea.

1107
01:27:36,854 --> 01:27:38,255
[SPEAKER_08]: We threw a party last year.

1108
01:27:38,355 --> 01:27:38,996
[SPEAKER_08]: We did throw a party.

1109
01:27:39,276 --> 01:27:41,677
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember hearing about that, but not like to invite

1110
01:27:42,242 --> 01:27:44,923
[SPEAKER_11]: others too, not just the CPA to come.

1111
01:27:44,963 --> 01:27:48,304
[SPEAKER_02]: We invited everybody we could possibly think of to come to our party.

1112
01:27:48,324 --> 01:27:50,405
[SPEAKER_02]: It was to celebrate five years.

1113
01:27:50,765 --> 01:27:55,086
[SPEAKER_02]: So we invited all of our grantees and city officials.

1114
01:27:55,126 --> 01:27:56,666
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it was a good time.

1115
01:27:56,686 --> 01:27:57,287
[SPEAKER_08]: Partners.

1116
01:27:57,767 --> 01:27:58,187
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1117
01:27:58,227 --> 01:27:58,987
[SPEAKER_08]: Way too much beer.

1118
01:28:00,448 --> 01:28:01,948
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm still drinking beer.

1119
01:28:04,149 --> 01:28:08,270
[SPEAKER_09]: I pulled out my Christmas decorations and I saw like two flats of Medford Brewing.

1120
01:28:08,330 --> 01:28:09,530
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, I love those.

1121
01:28:12,780 --> 01:28:14,301
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, that's all I had.

1122
01:28:14,321 --> 01:28:21,984
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't want to take up too much time, but just wanted to share that, hey, people are recognizing us for going out there on a cold night.

1123
01:28:23,765 --> 01:28:25,426
[SPEAKER_09]: I was in between two cookie vendors.

1124
01:28:25,606 --> 01:28:26,847
[SPEAKER_09]: One kept giving me hot cocoa.

1125
01:28:26,867 --> 01:28:28,668
[SPEAKER_09]: I gave her hand warmers.

1126
01:28:28,728 --> 01:28:32,529
[SPEAKER_09]: It was cold, but it was fun.

1127
01:28:32,609 --> 01:28:35,171
[SPEAKER_09]: It was fun.

1128
01:28:35,291 --> 01:28:35,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you.

1129
01:28:36,011 --> 01:28:37,552
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that is all of our agenda.

1130
01:28:37,572 --> 01:28:39,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, everyone, this evening.

1131
01:28:39,573 --> 01:28:40,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Good meeting.

1132
01:28:40,693 --> 01:28:41,093
[SPEAKER_02]: Good year.

1133
01:28:42,780 --> 01:28:43,360
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great year.

1134
01:28:43,481 --> 01:28:43,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1135
01:28:44,841 --> 01:28:51,526
[SPEAKER_02]: And we will start fresh next year thinking about what the next round is going to look like.

1136
01:28:52,047 --> 01:28:52,567
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1137
01:28:52,607 --> 01:28:57,070
[SPEAKER_06]: When do you go to city council with these decision recommendations?

1138
01:28:57,791 --> 01:28:59,272
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe it's the 20.

1139
01:28:59,312 --> 01:29:01,133
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll have a committee of the whole meeting.

1140
01:29:01,153 --> 01:29:03,815
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to say it's the 22nd.

1141
01:29:04,416 --> 01:29:06,197
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a Wednesday in January.

1142
01:29:06,237 --> 01:29:06,617
[SPEAKER_09]: January 22nd.

1143
01:29:06,717 --> 01:29:08,258
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not this month.

1144
01:29:11,396 --> 01:29:15,858
[SPEAKER_09]: And then City Council, the actual appropriation votes would be the following Tuesday.

1145
01:29:15,918 --> 01:29:19,120
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to say it's the 22nd or the 28th of January.

1146
01:29:20,661 --> 01:29:20,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1147
01:29:21,841 --> 01:29:22,822
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll send that out.

1148
01:29:24,284 --> 01:29:30,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Just one overall note, when I look at the list, I think there's 11 different line items.

1149
01:29:30,267 --> 01:29:34,170
[SPEAKER_04]: I think nine of them are City of Medford and there's just two churches.

1150
01:29:34,690 --> 01:29:38,712
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's the most unbalanced we've ever had.

1151
01:29:39,092 --> 01:29:43,695
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have the metrics just from memory, but they're all good projects.

1152
01:29:43,755 --> 01:29:44,835
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not objecting to anything.

1153
01:29:46,316 --> 01:29:51,178
[SPEAKER_04]: This round has become largely city-driven, all good projects.

1154
01:29:53,499 --> 01:30:00,540
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like we're not getting enough non-city, I guess, that we're not, you know, they're not competitive.

1155
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:03,521
[SPEAKER_04]: And we, I guess we could use more.

1156
01:30:03,821 --> 01:30:04,201
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1157
01:30:04,221 --> 01:30:12,202
[SPEAKER_11]: I was almost, I was almost wondering like some sort of like public event, like, are you a parent that has visions for a park?

1158
01:30:12,382 --> 01:30:17,543
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you a religious group that has like a need for your space?

1159
01:30:17,603 --> 01:30:22,244
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, you know, just like really targeting that exact kind of projects that we're trying to attract.

1160
01:30:23,327 --> 01:30:30,012
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't have a lot of nonprofit organizations that own historic buildings in the city.

1161
01:30:30,032 --> 01:30:41,440
[SPEAKER_02]: And not a lot of nonprofit organizations in general who can like who are managing public spaces indoors or outdoors.

1162
01:30:42,501 --> 01:30:44,502
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, it's a limited field.

1163
01:30:44,682 --> 01:30:45,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but

1164
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:47,220
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.

1165
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:52,901
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm not sure everyone knows that anyone could, like someone like the rights, remember the Rights Pond one?

1166
01:30:53,461 --> 01:30:58,322
[SPEAKER_04]: That was somebody say, I want to do something in rights because I care about it, and they found a way.

1167
01:30:58,342 --> 01:31:04,903
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was a hand-drawn sketch that was what the initial go around in that one.

1168
01:31:05,063 --> 01:31:05,824
[SPEAKER_04]: But we got it.

1169
01:31:06,144 --> 01:31:07,764
[SPEAKER_04]: We got them over the finish line.

1170
01:31:08,364 --> 01:31:11,905
[SPEAKER_04]: People need to know that a good idea will find a way.

1171
01:31:11,985 --> 01:31:13,445
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I'm hoping people understand.

1172
01:31:14,405 --> 01:31:32,616
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you make an excellent point there that we should start working now I'm trying to see if there's any non city projects are out there because Yes, two thirds of our applications this year we're city projects, I anticipate that number be higher next year because we hit the ARPA.

1173
01:31:33,272 --> 01:31:33,972
[SPEAKER_09]: money cliff.

1174
01:31:34,192 --> 01:31:40,416
[SPEAKER_09]: So the funding that has been being put back into projects, um, that that's gone now.

1175
01:31:40,836 --> 01:31:48,780
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so the city will probably be starting to get creative with funding sources and coming to the CPA here a little bit more aggressively.

1176
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:51,561
[SPEAKER_09]: That's just a me with my crystal ball.

1177
01:31:52,242 --> 01:31:53,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1178
01:31:54,003 --> 01:31:58,665
[SPEAKER_02]: I acknowledge that since the beginning of this program in the beginning,

1179
01:31:59,307 --> 01:32:07,923
[SPEAKER_02]: We had projects that were brought to us by public members of the public, where at that time we didn't have city staff.

1180
01:32:08,608 --> 01:32:12,789
[SPEAKER_02]: who were writing grants and managing projects.

1181
01:32:13,469 --> 01:32:20,692
[SPEAKER_02]: And the city has actually increased staffing in response to the availability of funding, which is a good thing.

1182
01:32:21,012 --> 01:32:29,534
[SPEAKER_02]: So the city actually has capacity to do what we were relying on volunteers to do in the past.

1183
01:32:29,554 --> 01:32:34,856
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's actually, you know, that's a trend in the right direction.

1184
01:32:34,896 --> 01:32:37,857
[SPEAKER_02]: It's professionalizing and centralizing

1185
01:32:38,817 --> 01:32:47,544
[SPEAKER_02]: our decision-making process rather than just squeaky wheel.

1186
01:32:47,564 --> 01:32:48,665
[SPEAKER_04]: You're absolutely right.

1187
01:32:48,725 --> 01:32:50,126
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to discount that.

1188
01:32:50,666 --> 01:32:54,269
[SPEAKER_04]: The city has this act together on looking at grant sources.

1189
01:32:54,329 --> 01:32:57,871
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen that improvement over the last five years dramatically.

1190
01:32:57,911 --> 01:32:58,512
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree with you.

1191
01:33:00,954 --> 01:33:03,636
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to offer everyone some pumpkin muffins.

1192
01:33:04,377 --> 01:33:08,680
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're all not here, so you can't have my pumpkin muffins.

1193
01:33:08,720 --> 01:33:09,741
[SPEAKER_02]: They're very good.

1194
01:33:10,241 --> 01:33:10,662
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1195
01:33:11,362 --> 01:33:13,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to mail me a pumpkin muffin?

1196
01:33:13,303 --> 01:33:14,584
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, second that.

1197
01:33:14,664 --> 01:33:15,165
[SPEAKER_06]: Second that.

1198
01:33:15,245 --> 01:33:18,887
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll take a couple home for my kids.

1199
01:33:18,928 --> 01:33:20,288
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, me too.

1200
01:33:20,329 --> 01:33:23,671
[SPEAKER_05]: Time to motion to close the meeting?

1201
01:33:24,592 --> 01:33:24,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Second.

1202
01:33:25,112 --> 01:33:29,055
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to say no, because I've been denied a pumpkin muffin.

1203
01:33:30,661 --> 01:33:32,542
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll be outvoted.

1204
01:33:33,283 --> 01:33:34,724
[SPEAKER_04]: I will be outvoted.

1205
01:33:35,605 --> 01:33:38,487
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1206
01:33:38,507 --> 01:33:40,709
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard a second from Ada.

1207
01:33:40,989 --> 01:33:42,110
[SPEAKER_02]: I will call the roll.

1208
01:33:42,150 --> 01:33:42,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Doug?

1209
01:33:43,391 --> 01:33:44,152
[SPEAKER_04]: Reluctantly, yes.
