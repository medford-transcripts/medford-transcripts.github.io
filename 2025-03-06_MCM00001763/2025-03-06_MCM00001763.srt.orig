26
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:08,442
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so we are going to start item number two, working group updates the trust action plan.

27
00:01:09,263 --> 00:01:18,508
[SPEAKER_07]: The action plan working group will provide an update on the upcoming community meeting, which is scheduled for a week from today, March 12th.

28
00:01:19,969 --> 00:01:22,250
[SPEAKER_07]: Roberta or Penny, do you want to?

29
00:01:23,437 --> 00:01:34,024
[SPEAKER_03]: That was just yeah, so we met last week and went over the presentation, which will largely be kind of the data presentation and then.

30
00:01:34,824 --> 00:01:44,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, some conversation introduction to the, well, we're going to put together a great presentation suffice to say, so it introduces the trust covers some of the data we've been looking at increases what.

31
00:01:45,431 --> 00:01:50,033
[SPEAKER_03]: It's already out there and then have some provoking questions to get the conversation going.

32
00:01:51,093 --> 00:01:55,075
[SPEAKER_03]: We heard that we had some good survey responses so far.

33
00:01:55,095 --> 00:01:57,656
[SPEAKER_03]: So hopefully we'll hear how many we've had to date.

34
00:01:57,676 --> 00:01:59,857
[SPEAKER_03]: 48 48 responses.

35
00:01:59,957 --> 00:02:00,337
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

36
00:02:00,977 --> 00:02:02,158
[SPEAKER_03]: So keep sending those out.

37
00:02:02,418 --> 00:02:04,499
[SPEAKER_03]: We also worked on kind of.

38
00:02:05,999 --> 00:02:24,687
[SPEAKER_03]: warm up that kind of gives us an info about who is participating in the room and online and then also kind of a mini survey for in-person day of just to get a quick sense of like who's in there with us and responding in live time and whose kind of commentary is going to be in that like focus group of sorts of that meeting.

39
00:02:25,767 --> 00:02:28,268
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, we're really looking forward to it.

40
00:02:28,368 --> 00:02:29,909
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know if you want to add anything.

41
00:02:29,929 --> 00:02:32,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think

42
00:02:32,863 --> 00:02:36,365
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that covers it, but it's going to be hybrid.

43
00:02:36,505 --> 00:02:41,888
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll be there in person and hopefully people will join us.

44
00:02:41,988 --> 00:02:44,189
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we have more people registered?

45
00:02:44,229 --> 00:02:51,272
[SPEAKER_01]: So 10 people have signed up to be present in person, but we don't have a number for virtual participants.

46
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:57,236
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just to know how many people are going to gather in the DPW building.

47
00:02:57,296 --> 00:02:57,716
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.

48
00:02:58,522 --> 00:03:03,246
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have a plan for facilitating a hybrid discussion.

49
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:04,027
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

50
00:03:04,948 --> 00:03:15,476
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and my colleague Teresa is going to be present in person and myself and Teresa will facilitate the participation responses.

51
00:03:17,218 --> 00:03:19,500
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll probably take turns, that's what we decided.

52
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:24,084
[SPEAKER_01]: So one in-person response followed by another one from a virtual participant.

53
00:03:25,018 --> 00:03:35,244
[SPEAKER_07]: Depending on how many yes, if necessary, we're going to do to break out groups hybrid breakout group and in person.

54
00:03:35,344 --> 00:03:35,745
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

55
00:03:36,565 --> 00:03:37,706
[SPEAKER_07]: And then bring it back in.

56
00:03:38,266 --> 00:03:39,647
[SPEAKER_07]: Bring the information back.

57
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:44,090
[SPEAKER_07]: And then again, that's next Wednesday.

58
00:03:46,904 --> 00:03:49,325
[SPEAKER_07]: 6 o'clock at DPW.

59
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:55,129
[SPEAKER_07]: So DPW is on James Street, which is down Main Street a little bit.

60
00:03:56,389 --> 00:03:57,310
[SPEAKER_01]: 21st James Street.

61
00:03:57,890 --> 00:03:58,571
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

62
00:03:59,471 --> 00:04:02,233
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you have a nice meeting room there.

63
00:04:03,013 --> 00:04:07,516
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you've never been there before, you'll go in the main door and

64
00:04:09,298 --> 00:04:11,199
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully that'll be unlocked for us.

65
00:04:11,679 --> 00:04:20,622
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there'll be a hallway to the, like after you go in a few feet, then there's a hallway to the left and you turn left there and it's at the end of that hallway.

66
00:04:21,242 --> 00:04:21,762
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.

67
00:04:22,242 --> 00:04:28,424
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just wanted to know, it's DLX exam this weekend, so make sure you set those clocks so you can make it to the meeting at the right time.

68
00:04:28,824 --> 00:04:32,785
[SPEAKER_03]: And can you tell us a little about the interpretation services that will be there?

69
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:36,927
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, so our community liaisons will be present

70
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:44,974
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have interpretation services in Spanish, Haitian, Creole, Brazilian, Portuguese, and Arabic.

71
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:47,638
[SPEAKER_04]: That's wonderful.

72
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:49,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

73
00:04:52,898 --> 00:05:11,273
[SPEAKER_07]: And I hope that the liaisons will feel empowered to also participate in the conversation, especially because they may have insight about the needs of the people who they work with, even if none of those people come to the meeting.

74
00:05:11,883 --> 00:05:13,364
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that is true.

75
00:05:13,944 --> 00:05:20,267
[SPEAKER_01]: I attended one of their evening meetings where they get to know what different departments in the city hall is doing.

76
00:05:20,307 --> 00:05:25,910
[SPEAKER_01]: So I spoke about the affordable housing trust and the community meeting and they had great questions about affordable housing.

77
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:29,471
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll probably send them an email saying that they could also participate.

78
00:05:29,491 --> 00:05:29,932
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

79
00:05:35,476 --> 00:05:43,999
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think we wanted to also talk about the timeline beyond the meetings.

80
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:58,725
[SPEAKER_07]: After this community meeting, then we're going to turn the action plan toward, so we'll draft a summary of everything that we learned from the stakeholders in the community meeting and

81
00:06:00,365 --> 00:06:14,216
[SPEAKER_07]: the data analysis that we did, and then bring that back to this group and start over the next few months going through what is going to be the substance of the action plan.

82
00:06:14,316 --> 00:06:22,322
[SPEAKER_07]: So this group will look together at the mission statement, goals, priority actions, guidelines, and procedures.

83
00:06:23,142 --> 00:06:27,866
[SPEAKER_07]: that will guide what the group does going forward.

84
00:06:28,206 --> 00:06:45,661
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's what we'll be using all of this input to help us develop those things.

85
00:06:46,962 --> 00:06:48,484
[SPEAKER_07]: Does anybody have any questions?

86
00:06:50,978 --> 00:07:00,985
[SPEAKER_05]: In the community meeting, I'm assuming that you three would kind of be kind of head and field the majority of questions and comments through it.

87
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:09,371
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to understand if there's any specific role that other members of the trust should prepare for before that meeting.

88
00:07:09,391 --> 00:07:10,711
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a great question.

89
00:07:12,792 --> 00:07:15,394
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, I thought just one more time.

90
00:07:15,454 --> 00:07:23,738
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say, I assume that the three of you were going to kind of lead the discussion and field the majority of the questions from the community.

91
00:07:24,058 --> 00:07:29,981
[SPEAKER_05]: Was there any specific role that you wanted the other members of the trust to prepare for before coming to that meeting?

92
00:07:30,722 --> 00:07:36,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Or just kind of show up, throw in a center to here and there and just let things kind of

93
00:07:37,899 --> 00:07:38,319
[SPEAKER_05]: unfold?

94
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,761
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think so.

95
00:07:40,021 --> 00:07:46,006
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, it may be that we don't, we didn't think of questions that might come to you to ask as you hear the discussion.

96
00:07:46,727 --> 00:07:51,711
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think, you know, there will be room for a back and forth conversation.

97
00:07:51,931 --> 00:08:00,219
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that rather members of the trust can feel free to contribute questions that would be helpful for you to hear about.

98
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:01,720
[SPEAKER_03]: I think

99
00:08:02,371 --> 00:08:15,627
[SPEAKER_03]: make sure you invite people and encourage them to take the survey before next Wednesday will be really important and then also yeah I think we should introduce all the trust members at the beginning and I know that in just chatting with neighbors about

100
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:20,073
[SPEAKER_03]: interest in topics, I was like, oh, there's a trusted member that's really into that.

101
00:08:20,093 --> 00:08:21,574
[SPEAKER_03]: This is you actually.

102
00:08:21,594 --> 00:08:25,357
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was like, oh, you go to the community meeting, she might be there and you can talk to her about it.

103
00:08:25,397 --> 00:08:28,700
[SPEAKER_03]: So just in terms of like making connections in the community too.

104
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:32,823
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I think like inviting folks to participate, meeting and the survey and yeah.

105
00:08:35,636 --> 00:08:39,139
[SPEAKER_03]: being part of it, because... Yeah, it's exciting.

106
00:08:39,199 --> 00:08:39,579
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

107
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:40,600
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm really excited.

108
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:42,542
[SPEAKER_07]: We've done a lot.

109
00:08:42,642 --> 00:08:46,565
[SPEAKER_07]: Roberta has done amazing work on the presentation of data collections.

110
00:08:46,885 --> 00:08:47,266
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

111
00:08:47,686 --> 00:08:48,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

112
00:08:49,567 --> 00:08:51,589
[SPEAKER_06]: just signed the contract this morning for the first $250,000.

113
00:08:52,009 --> 00:08:52,469
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

114
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:53,831
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we did.

115
00:08:53,931 --> 00:08:54,351
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

116
00:08:54,371 --> 00:08:58,675
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that probably is an extra agenda item.

117
00:08:58,695 --> 00:08:59,375
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

118
00:08:59,475 --> 00:09:01,617
[SPEAKER_07]: It's exciting.

119
00:09:01,637 --> 00:09:02,658
[SPEAKER_07]: It's exciting.

120
00:09:02,718 --> 00:09:04,399
[SPEAKER_07]: Last month, I'm so excited.

121
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,801
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got things happening.

122
00:09:09,003 --> 00:09:14,668
[SPEAKER_07]: Any other questions about the upcoming community meeting next week?

123
00:09:14,848 --> 00:09:17,550
[SPEAKER_07]: Just in case I haven't said it, next week, March 12th,

124
00:09:19,243 --> 00:09:23,946
[SPEAKER_07]: 6 o'clock at the DPW 21 Jane Street and Zoom, right?

125
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:26,107
[SPEAKER_07]: And Zoom, yes, it is a hybrid meeting.

126
00:09:28,028 --> 00:09:29,068
[SPEAKER_07]: Great, thank you.

127
00:09:29,789 --> 00:09:32,890
[SPEAKER_07]: 21 Jane Street, okay.

128
00:09:33,351 --> 00:09:36,032
[SPEAKER_01]: And Rupula, do you mind sending the presentation?

129
00:09:37,093 --> 00:09:46,478
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd like to have a clue also for the survey that Penny prepared so that participants who are virtually present can also sign up.

130
00:09:48,606 --> 00:09:51,228
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, right down the street.

131
00:09:51,248 --> 00:09:53,910
[SPEAKER_07]: Cheap swearing and ceremony so I'm, I may not run late but that's probably.

132
00:10:07,317 --> 00:10:13,582
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so we are going to item number three is funding application guidelines and framework.

133
00:10:13,782 --> 00:10:20,047
[SPEAKER_07]: Kayla has created a draft, a developer application for the board's review and to provide comments.

134
00:10:20,127 --> 00:10:20,968
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Kayla.

135
00:10:21,168 --> 00:10:22,549
[SPEAKER_07]: This looks great.

136
00:10:24,271 --> 00:10:29,955
[SPEAKER_05]: So I did start and then I started like a summary and guidelines and then I realized I didn't know what I was doing.

137
00:10:29,975 --> 00:10:35,560
[SPEAKER_05]: So I wanted to just keep it to the, you know, the information that I think we might launch

138
00:10:36,282 --> 00:10:43,044
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a developer and try not to get into what our priorities are, what any specific programs are going to look like.

139
00:10:43,084 --> 00:10:45,904
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's pretty general as much as I could.

140
00:10:45,924 --> 00:10:51,766
[SPEAKER_05]: This is supposed to just kind of be like a one-page cover sheet.

141
00:10:52,146 --> 00:10:57,767
[SPEAKER_05]: You get some basic information about the location and the big numbers.

142
00:10:57,827 --> 00:10:59,567
[SPEAKER_05]: How much are they asking you to trust?

143
00:10:59,887 --> 00:11:01,788
[SPEAKER_05]: How much is the total project cost?

144
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:06,530
[SPEAKER_05]: Number of housing units and number of housing units that are below 80% AMI.

145
00:11:09,671 --> 00:11:16,755
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I just gave them a really big page to just give a narrative summary.

146
00:11:16,795 --> 00:11:22,978
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they'll probably answer a lot of the following questions in this, but just wanted to give them the space to give them the whole spiel.

147
00:11:22,998 --> 00:11:31,082
[SPEAKER_05]: Then the next section, again, just trying to keep it broad and not

148
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:38,797
[SPEAKER_05]: Eliminate possibilities, but also try to give us a sense of what everything is the type of projects.

149
00:11:38,917 --> 00:11:43,983
[SPEAKER_05]: Purpose of funding requested again, try to keep it broad since we don't know exactly what we're talking about here.

150
00:11:45,365 --> 00:11:47,227
[SPEAKER_05]: Sources of funds again, just try to.

151
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:52,113
[SPEAKER_05]: Think of all the possibilities that any of these might end up with.

152
00:11:53,147 --> 00:11:57,071
[SPEAKER_05]: So obviously the affordable housing trust fund, that would be what they're requesting from us.

153
00:11:57,091 --> 00:12:02,696
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, another local match, construction loans, permanent loans, any other things that they can think of.

154
00:12:05,338 --> 00:12:16,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Targeted population, you know, if they have any specific populations that they're looking to assist and house, any other services.

155
00:12:21,062 --> 00:12:29,968
[SPEAKER_05]: Type of full housing, so this is almost supposed to be like a two-sided column, but we didn't get that in this iteration.

156
00:12:29,988 --> 00:12:36,672
[SPEAKER_05]: So either home ownership on the left or rental on the right, again, just a check the box situation.

157
00:12:36,693 --> 00:12:43,977
[SPEAKER_05]: Unit composition, so I split it up by the different bedrooms.

158
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:55,093
[SPEAKER_05]: and SRO, which is single room occupancy, and then try to break it out by the different AMI levels that we would be looking at.

159
00:12:55,113 --> 00:13:08,376
[SPEAKER_05]: I did throw in 120 percent if we end up seeing any workforce or upper tier, up that tier of housing, they just want to know that it's there and it is restricted.

160
00:13:09,256 --> 00:13:11,677
[SPEAKER_05]: That is something to note and then the number of market rate.

161
00:13:15,026 --> 00:13:17,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Also wanted to talk about accessible units by unit type.

162
00:13:18,169 --> 00:13:23,175
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe have them append something in the same kind of format using that.

163
00:13:23,995 --> 00:13:26,138
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I think, do you think this is yours?

164
00:13:26,979 --> 00:13:35,128
[SPEAKER_05]: Add the affordability restriction type and the affordability period proposed for all of these affordable units.

165
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:39,452
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's really the bulk of the form.

166
00:13:39,832 --> 00:13:45,837
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I just go into a huge list of everything else they have to provide us.

167
00:13:46,257 --> 00:13:53,242
[SPEAKER_05]: I think most housing developers would be pretty familiar with this list.

168
00:13:53,262 --> 00:14:00,928
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of it's based on one stop and then a lot of it's gonna be just kind of narrative about that organization.

169
00:14:01,649 --> 00:14:05,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Community outreach was one section that I tried to maybe

170
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:30,087
[SPEAKER_05]: focus on a little bit, you know, talk about what our priorities are, when we do have priorities, talk about how the project meets Metro's housing needs as referenced in the housing production plan, and I linked it, talked about any tenant relocation plans, also the description of specific tenant outreach and meetings.

171
00:14:32,043 --> 00:14:33,464
[SPEAKER_05]: And same for community support.

172
00:14:33,524 --> 00:14:39,149
[SPEAKER_05]: So I wanted to both talk about letters of support from community groups, letters of support from the neighborhood.

173
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:46,435
[SPEAKER_05]: And also just want to hear about any communication or meetings that they have, you know, really positive or negative, right?

174
00:14:46,535 --> 00:14:49,657
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to hear that they're at least out there talking to people.

175
00:14:50,538 --> 00:14:52,940
[SPEAKER_05]: And then how they incorporate that feedback from them.

176
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:57,724
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, if they have made changes to respond to them, I think that would be important for us to know.

177
00:15:00,811 --> 00:15:05,413
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the rest, again, kind of site control.

178
00:15:05,873 --> 00:15:08,614
[SPEAKER_05]: If there's an existing building, just information about that building.

179
00:15:08,634 --> 00:15:17,117
[SPEAKER_05]: And then try to just create a laundry list of anything, any kind of information that we think we might need or they would be gathering.

180
00:15:17,657 --> 00:15:23,340
[SPEAKER_05]: I think depending on where level, you know, how far along they are, some of these they wouldn't have.

181
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,802
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think that that's just kind of a sense of how ready they are and where they are in the process as well.

182
00:15:34,294 --> 00:15:35,494
[SPEAKER_05]: That section's a lot.

183
00:15:35,974 --> 00:15:40,336
[SPEAKER_05]: If anyone has any questions or additions in that area.

184
00:15:42,257 --> 00:15:45,058
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for doing that.

185
00:15:45,158 --> 00:15:45,899
[SPEAKER_07]: It's amazing.

186
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:48,200
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

187
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,941
[SPEAKER_07]: Does anybody have any questions?

188
00:15:49,961 --> 00:15:51,601
[SPEAKER_07]: A couple of things.

189
00:15:51,661 --> 00:15:52,322
[SPEAKER_07]: First of all,

190
00:15:54,358 --> 00:16:16,430
[SPEAKER_07]: This application alone exemplifies why it's so important that we have the Affordable Housing Trust and not just relying on the CPC because we just haven't had the expertise to be able to ask the questions that we needed to ask of developers to help them design projects that would be successful along the way.

191
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:22,333
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is just already value-added that we have been sorely missing.

192
00:16:23,234 --> 00:16:34,181
[SPEAKER_07]: A couple of really minor points, questions I had was on the table, the first table of the sources of funds, be helpful to have a total row at the bottom.

193
00:16:35,642 --> 00:16:50,391
[SPEAKER_07]: And on the table for unit composition, I wonder if it could be helpful to have an other column in case, you know, like there are other percentage points that they could hit in between.

194
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:53,566
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, 40% and 60% mean.

195
00:16:53,606 --> 00:16:54,786
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, another fillable column.

196
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:54,966
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

197
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:18,543
[SPEAKER_07]: Which brings me to I had a couple questions as well on the cover sheet where we're asking for the number of units at 80% of AMI.

198
00:17:18,943 --> 00:17:21,925
[SPEAKER_07]: If we're using CPA funds, we can go all the way up to 100% AMI.

199
00:17:22,025 --> 00:17:23,385
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we ever get non-CPA money,

200
00:17:28,187 --> 00:17:29,807
[SPEAKER_07]: please correct me if I'm wrong.

201
00:17:29,888 --> 00:17:38,830
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to go back and look at our declaration of trust, but usually non-CPA money, trust money can go up to 110% of AMI.

202
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:40,370
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if we did that.

203
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:42,491
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we stopped at 80.

204
00:17:43,191 --> 00:17:45,131
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'll have to check again.

205
00:17:45,191 --> 00:17:46,212
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

206
00:17:46,332 --> 00:17:49,212
[SPEAKER_07]: But at least CPA is able to go up to 100% of AMI.

207
00:17:49,432 --> 00:17:50,453
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

208
00:17:51,453 --> 00:17:52,713
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't know if that works.

209
00:17:52,733 --> 00:17:53,053
[SPEAKER_07]: And then

210
00:17:58,649 --> 00:18:07,795
[SPEAKER_07]: The only question I had with the unit composition is if we're doing equal to or less than 120% AMI, does that

211
00:18:12,028 --> 00:18:16,870
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that an assumption that we would fund something at 120% AMI?

212
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:19,952
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that's a good clarification.

213
00:18:20,272 --> 00:18:29,797
[SPEAKER_05]: I did not mean that to say that we would fund something in that level, but just wanted to get a sense of the total mix and not just loop it into market rate.

214
00:18:30,717 --> 00:18:34,338
[SPEAKER_05]: There are some funding sources that are linked, so I think 100 to 120%.

215
00:18:34,838 --> 00:18:35,078
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

216
00:18:35,478 --> 00:18:42,219
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have workforce units in Medford, and I monitor their rent increase approval, and they're at 120%.

217
00:18:42,479 --> 00:18:42,759
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

218
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,220
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

219
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:59,483
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe then it would be helpful to have a sentence of explanation under the title unit composition to say this includes both affordable housing trust-supported units and units that are not supported by the authority funds interest.

220
00:18:59,803 --> 00:18:59,963
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

221
00:19:01,063 --> 00:19:04,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

222
00:19:06,425 --> 00:19:12,247
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, actually, now that I look at it, it has the market rate on it, too, so I'm like, yeah, request some market rates.

223
00:19:12,307 --> 00:19:13,568
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, but thank you.

224
00:19:13,628 --> 00:19:15,669
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I had one more, tiny questions, really, for the city staff.

225
00:19:25,845 --> 00:19:39,930
[SPEAKER_07]: When we're talking about does this project meet the proposed housing needs of Medford, when looking at applications for developments, do they have to work with the consolidated plan?

226
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:41,651
[SPEAKER_07]: Do they have to meet within

227
00:19:42,468 --> 00:19:43,788
[SPEAKER_07]: The consolidated plan.

228
00:19:44,469 --> 00:19:46,089
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, is it the comprehensive?

229
00:19:46,109 --> 00:19:46,749
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

230
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:47,150
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

231
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:49,570
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, they do have to.

232
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:50,251
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

233
00:19:50,991 --> 00:19:59,334
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe that maybe that's what an additional question to ask is, is it this is in line with our company.

234
00:19:59,374 --> 00:20:05,296
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to align with the company, but they don't have to like.

235
00:20:07,157 --> 00:20:09,478
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they don't have to.

236
00:20:09,838 --> 00:20:16,300
[SPEAKER_06]: There's been proposals that don't align with the comp plan, and then it would just go to normal process, to CD board or zoning board.

237
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,720
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, zoning board, yes.

238
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,160
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what you were referring to?

239
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:19,701
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

240
00:20:19,721 --> 00:20:20,741
[SPEAKER_01]: It does a development plan, 100%.

241
00:20:20,781 --> 00:20:21,381
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

242
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:22,141
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just a guide.

243
00:20:22,161 --> 00:20:22,821
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, just a guide.

244
00:20:22,901 --> 00:20:23,682
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, thank you.

245
00:20:29,617 --> 00:20:39,284
[SPEAKER_07]: So we can edit it just for B to say housing production plan and comprehensive plan rather than making it a separate question.

246
00:20:39,624 --> 00:20:39,884
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

247
00:20:40,524 --> 00:20:40,765
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

248
00:20:42,466 --> 00:20:51,312
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe I'll reword it because I think meets kind of conveys this idea of like you have to conform to some of that.

249
00:20:51,332 --> 00:20:55,955
[SPEAKER_05]: I think meets might be the word that I need to change.

250
00:20:57,025 --> 00:20:58,767
[SPEAKER_07]: Align, align, align.

251
00:20:58,807 --> 00:20:59,648
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.

252
00:20:59,888 --> 00:21:14,782
[SPEAKER_07]: And then like, when we're looking at applications, because we're excited about getting applications, you can go like, based on scores, like if somebody's aligned with a score or something that way.

253
00:21:15,082 --> 00:21:15,223
Yeah.

254
00:21:18,546 --> 00:21:20,707
[SPEAKER_07]: Lisa's son has her hand raised.

255
00:21:20,787 --> 00:21:21,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I'm sorry.

256
00:21:22,108 --> 00:21:23,168
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, son, Lisa.

257
00:21:24,128 --> 00:21:24,509
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.

258
00:21:25,849 --> 00:21:29,951
[SPEAKER_00]: I had just two minor questions as well.

259
00:21:29,971 --> 00:21:33,132
[SPEAKER_00]: So back to the unit composition matrix.

260
00:21:34,892 --> 00:21:40,414
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a reason we're using those AMIs or like those are called out in columns?

261
00:21:40,514 --> 00:21:42,055
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I typically see

262
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:47,753
[SPEAKER_00]: 60% AMI and not, I don't remember seeing 50 very commonly.

263
00:21:47,793 --> 00:21:56,377
[SPEAKER_00]: So just wondering the reason behind the ones you chose and if it makes sense, yeah.

264
00:21:57,138 --> 00:22:03,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think the 50 and the 60 is sometimes a tough one to pick.

265
00:22:03,661 --> 00:22:08,744
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought of 50 and now I'm trying to remember why.

266
00:22:09,669 --> 00:22:12,870
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure why I thought it was 50 versus 60.

267
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:15,730
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it the 20 percent?

268
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:24,612
[SPEAKER_05]: I think for a low-income tax credit, it has to be 20 percent at 50 percent or 40 percent at 60 percent.

269
00:22:25,652 --> 00:22:29,073
[SPEAKER_05]: I think a lot of times people year towards the 50.

270
00:22:29,453 --> 00:22:36,995
[SPEAKER_05]: I think also I use 50 sometimes because I believe that that's usually the AMI that local housing agencies use for mobile Section 8 vouchers.

271
00:22:39,213 --> 00:22:44,957
[SPEAKER_05]: generally what sometimes I use, but I think those are the only reasons why I did 50 versus 60.

272
00:22:44,997 --> 00:22:54,784
[SPEAKER_05]: I am perfectly open to just saying 60 and below, which I think would encompass that same AMI level, no matter what.

273
00:22:54,824 --> 00:22:59,907
[SPEAKER_05]: So we do 30, 60, and 80, if that makes more sense.

274
00:23:02,069 --> 00:23:07,533
[SPEAKER_07]: Then maybe replace the 120 with a question mark, like make that one be the fillable.

275
00:23:09,899 --> 00:23:11,019
[SPEAKER_05]: The other, okay.

276
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,220
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that makes sense.

277
00:23:15,941 --> 00:23:19,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Should it go up by maybe 20% for each AMI?

278
00:23:20,142 --> 00:23:21,623
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good question too.

279
00:23:21,763 --> 00:23:24,324
[SPEAKER_05]: So it'd be 60, 80, 100.

280
00:23:25,984 --> 00:23:30,286
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe though the 30 is one that is usually designated.

281
00:23:30,326 --> 00:23:34,707
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that's why I think the 30 might be the right level on below.

282
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:37,468
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't think there's a lot of 40% of AMI.

283
00:23:37,488 --> 00:23:37,528
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

284
00:23:40,441 --> 00:23:42,443
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so.

285
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:55,293
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say about 30, 60, 80, 100 and then maybe leave the 120 blank and say other and let them fill in what they want just so we don't get too big of a table here in the middle.

286
00:23:55,393 --> 00:23:55,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

287
00:23:57,275 --> 00:23:59,937
[SPEAKER_04]: Lisa, did you?

288
00:24:00,037 --> 00:24:02,439
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I don't know one way or another.

289
00:24:02,459 --> 00:24:05,161
[SPEAKER_00]: I just I just know that on a lot of

290
00:24:06,447 --> 00:24:07,848
[SPEAKER_00]: applications, I see 60.

291
00:24:08,388 --> 00:24:10,069
[SPEAKER_00]: So just wanted to ask.

292
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:20,737
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other question I had was for the targeted population, do we want to include veterans as a category?

293
00:24:20,757 --> 00:24:29,062
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so I think we could probably work on some of the language in this as well.

294
00:24:29,322 --> 00:24:31,224
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm very happy to take

295
00:24:32,188 --> 00:24:36,811
[SPEAKER_05]: All comments on language and what other populations we should talk about.

296
00:24:38,312 --> 00:24:42,074
[SPEAKER_05]: So right now just have family, which I think in general is just like untargeted.

297
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:51,680
[SPEAKER_05]: Senior slash elderly, homelessness, homeless at risk of homelessness, special needs, housing with support services, and other.

298
00:24:53,441 --> 00:24:58,423
[SPEAKER_06]: So we said we talked about veterans, maybe special needs slash disabled.

299
00:24:58,443 --> 00:24:59,244
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

300
00:25:13,757 --> 00:25:20,180
[SPEAKER_07]: Most applications I see usually says senior elder slash disabled.

301
00:25:23,102 --> 00:25:28,605
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of like the idea of keeping them separate as population groups though.

302
00:25:30,003 --> 00:25:37,340
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, for public housing, they're grouped together, but in other, like in private housing, they're often not grouped together.

303
00:25:38,858 --> 00:25:47,000
[SPEAKER_03]: And I also think like, it's just like, young disabilities is a group that I know is really hard to place in housing and find housing for.

304
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:53,461
[SPEAKER_03]: So I mean, like other distinctions within each of these that I think like, are, yeah, could be focuses.

305
00:25:54,101 --> 00:25:57,362
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would propose keeping them separate.

306
00:25:58,122 --> 00:26:03,923
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, just as I'm talking, I'll say I wonder if we want to align our percentages to what the like,

307
00:26:04,763 --> 00:26:11,829
[SPEAKER_03]: zoning incentive percentages are or if that is too complicated and starting that idea into the percentage conversation.

308
00:26:11,849 --> 00:26:14,411
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember what that one is.

309
00:26:14,511 --> 00:26:17,313
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that depends on the different zoning districts.

310
00:26:17,453 --> 00:26:19,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's a different district.

311
00:26:19,915 --> 00:26:20,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Forget it.

312
00:26:20,856 --> 00:26:22,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Forget that.

313
00:26:22,317 --> 00:26:24,198
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just work on keeping those two separate.

314
00:26:24,218 --> 00:26:27,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Zoning, you know, tonight on 7th Street, things like that.

315
00:26:27,281 --> 00:26:27,541
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

316
00:26:28,965 --> 00:26:32,188
[SPEAKER_04]: What about maybe veterans?

317
00:26:32,288 --> 00:26:41,675
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think we're going to include veterans as a separate organization.

318
00:26:41,795 --> 00:26:46,859
[SPEAKER_07]: Does anybody object to taking out special needs and just put disabled?

319
00:26:47,139 --> 00:26:47,879
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I think.

320
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:49,120
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no, that's great.

321
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:49,661
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

322
00:26:49,681 --> 00:26:54,404
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good question.

323
00:26:56,908 --> 00:27:00,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Are studio apartments ever funded with these or not?

324
00:27:00,632 --> 00:27:04,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that need to be a row studio unit?

325
00:27:08,266 --> 00:27:13,508
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I think that a lot of the state funding kind of prefers at least a bedroom.

326
00:27:13,528 --> 00:27:21,092
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if there's a lot of studio that aren't SROs, but we could at least leave the option open.

327
00:27:21,112 --> 00:27:28,295
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think maybe also with our specific housing needs, it might be an area that we want to at least explore.

328
00:27:28,315 --> 00:27:30,676
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they could be market.

329
00:27:31,543 --> 00:27:33,626
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, they could be a studio.

330
00:27:33,706 --> 00:27:37,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so why don't I do studio before one bed in between us our own?

331
00:27:38,632 --> 00:27:43,419
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm seeing a lot of so single room occupancies for SROs.

332
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:47,664
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not seeing a lot of SROs applications.

333
00:27:48,492 --> 00:27:54,954
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mostly just, I go to Caritas each year, so I think about Caritas.

334
00:27:55,074 --> 00:28:01,616
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're perfect for some of the targeted populations that we care about.

335
00:28:02,056 --> 00:28:04,017
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Malden had one recently.

336
00:28:04,157 --> 00:28:04,857
[SPEAKER_01]: Did they?

337
00:28:04,957 --> 00:28:05,818
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

338
00:28:06,318 --> 00:28:09,939
[SPEAKER_01]: Metro North Housing, they worked with that development, yeah.

339
00:28:13,913 --> 00:28:16,635
[SPEAKER_07]: This looks great, thank you.

340
00:28:17,236 --> 00:28:20,098
[SPEAKER_07]: Does anybody have any questions, any other questions, comments?

341
00:28:24,762 --> 00:28:32,388
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we move on to the next agenda, I just wanted to talk about this potential developer who has requested funding from the trust.

342
00:28:33,729 --> 00:28:39,474
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of the timeline, they are expecting soft commitments from the trust by this summer.

343
00:28:41,135 --> 00:28:48,298
[SPEAKER_01]: just to give you a heads up, if we can have the application and loan documents ready by the summer, that would be great.

344
00:28:48,438 --> 00:28:49,859
[SPEAKER_07]: Like early summer?

345
00:28:49,879 --> 00:28:51,720
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably late summer.

346
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:57,442
[SPEAKER_01]: Late, late summer, I think, because the one-stop application is in October.

347
00:28:57,602 --> 00:29:03,705
[SPEAKER_01]: So they need to have a local soft commitment ready before they apply for one-stop.

348
00:29:08,986 --> 00:29:15,288
[SPEAKER_01]: October is the pre-application window for the one-stop application.

349
00:29:16,328 --> 00:29:19,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Chair, what are the next steps with this document?

350
00:29:19,489 --> 00:29:22,209
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess, do we need to approve it?

351
00:29:22,289 --> 00:29:24,850
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it need to be run by anybody else?

352
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:27,271
[SPEAKER_03]: Just thinking of the timeline.

353
00:29:28,948 --> 00:29:32,630
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a pretty awesome document that obviously, you know, it's a little feedback.

354
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:34,691
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's in a great place personally.

355
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:37,352
[SPEAKER_03]: So whatever, what do we need to do to move that forward?

356
00:29:37,372 --> 00:29:38,713
[SPEAKER_03]: So like that box is checked.

357
00:29:39,513 --> 00:29:40,574
[SPEAKER_06]: Move approval as amended.

358
00:29:42,055 --> 00:29:42,295
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

359
00:29:42,495 --> 00:29:42,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

360
00:29:42,995 --> 00:29:45,556
[SPEAKER_03]: And move that we approve this document as amended.

361
00:29:45,576 --> 00:29:46,357
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

362
00:29:48,198 --> 00:29:48,778
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

363
00:29:49,158 --> 00:29:56,322
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we will vote on the motion to approve the application as amended.

364
00:29:56,342 --> 00:29:57,382
[SPEAKER_07]: Kayla?

365
00:29:58,183 --> 00:29:58,383
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

366
00:29:59,783 --> 00:30:00,343
[SPEAKER_07]: Roberta?

367
00:30:00,544 --> 00:30:00,824
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

368
00:30:01,724 --> 00:30:02,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Carrie?

369
00:30:02,185 --> 00:30:02,485
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

370
00:30:02,805 --> 00:30:03,426
[SPEAKER_07]: Penelope?

371
00:30:03,466 --> 00:30:03,706
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

372
00:30:04,086 --> 00:30:04,586
[SPEAKER_07]: Lisa?

373
00:30:05,027 --> 00:30:05,267
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

374
00:30:07,028 --> 00:30:07,428
[SPEAKER_07]: Mayor?

375
00:30:07,669 --> 00:30:07,989
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

376
00:30:08,649 --> 00:30:09,230
[SPEAKER_07]: And Lisa?

377
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:09,630
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

378
00:30:11,311 --> 00:30:13,313
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion approved.

379
00:30:13,493 --> 00:30:14,894
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion approved.

380
00:30:15,274 --> 00:30:18,797
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the likelihood, excuse me, what's the likelihood

381
00:30:20,002 --> 00:30:26,507
[SPEAKER_07]: of the city being able to have draft loan documents and everything.

382
00:30:26,547 --> 00:30:30,030
[SPEAKER_07]: Just looking at the time frame, we're in March.

383
00:30:31,231 --> 00:30:31,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

384
00:30:31,992 --> 00:30:35,435
[SPEAKER_05]: This would be a commitment to the developer.

385
00:30:36,964 --> 00:30:39,265
[SPEAKER_05]: They wouldn't have to close on the... That's true.

386
00:30:39,905 --> 00:30:40,426
[SPEAKER_08]: That's true.

387
00:30:40,446 --> 00:30:45,788
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's just a funding commitment today, and then I think we can negotiate or see when you'd actually need the funds.

388
00:30:46,068 --> 00:30:47,229
[SPEAKER_05]: They would actually need the funds.

389
00:30:47,789 --> 00:31:01,014
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, but I think we should have some guidelines ready so that they know what are our loan terms, and probably the board should discuss what the rate of interest would be for the loan terms, so if we want to have the loan.

390
00:31:01,035 --> 00:31:06,317
[SPEAKER_06]: And through the chair, can you just refresh my memory what the developer's looking to do?

391
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:11,534
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't specifically talk who the developer is.

392
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:16,920
[SPEAKER_01]: I just said there is a potential developer who's interested to develop 100% affordable housing.

393
00:31:17,741 --> 00:31:21,886
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a non-profit developer.

394
00:31:21,906 --> 00:31:22,887
[SPEAKER_01]: 100% affordable housing.

395
00:31:22,907 --> 00:31:25,670
[SPEAKER_06]: So we don't have any units or anything like that?

396
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,441
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say, yes.

397
00:31:28,921 --> 00:31:30,442
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think we've asked anything yet.

398
00:31:30,462 --> 00:31:37,306
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because we just had an initial call and they wanted to know if... Can you tell us how much they're looking for?

399
00:31:38,326 --> 00:31:42,068
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of the funding, anything that the city can offer.

400
00:31:42,088 --> 00:31:42,889
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

401
00:31:42,909 --> 00:31:43,229
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yeah.

402
00:31:47,923 --> 00:31:58,472
[SPEAKER_07]: So we could potentially for the next meeting, which would be in April by March, actually start putting it on the agenda to discuss a long term.

403
00:31:58,512 --> 00:31:58,712
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

404
00:32:00,153 --> 00:32:01,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

405
00:32:01,834 --> 00:32:04,837
[SPEAKER_06]: Would we discuss how much we would.

406
00:32:06,196 --> 00:32:27,037
[SPEAKER_06]: loan per unit like how does that work yeah that's great questions and i think those are those are the things that we're someone heard we got money and they're like yeah we're talking about another development and it's probably a different one than that that's just started talking about yeah this money this week too so there might be multiple so i'm just like if we

407
00:32:27,617 --> 00:32:29,278
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to take 250 because it sounds great.

408
00:32:29,878 --> 00:32:31,778
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, exactly.

409
00:32:31,838 --> 00:32:35,019
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's a couple of things that are in it.

410
00:32:35,099 --> 00:32:39,081
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't know what we're going to do for our unit funding.

411
00:32:41,661 --> 00:32:47,423
[SPEAKER_07]: We haven't had that discussion yet because we're so in, like, starting at it, right?

412
00:32:49,124 --> 00:32:50,444
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't know what they're asking for.

413
00:32:50,684 --> 00:32:50,884
[SPEAKER_07]: I think

414
00:32:53,699 --> 00:32:59,787
[SPEAKER_07]: These are great questions that we can start talking about and that's in April, maybe May meeting.

415
00:33:00,769 --> 00:33:08,619
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think I heard that the CPC would welcome us back

416
00:33:09,629 --> 00:33:10,950
[SPEAKER_07]: if we needed more money.

417
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:29,616
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not gonna put anybody on the hook, but I feel like that is what I heard when we were A, presenting, when we were here presenting for the ask, what I heard a lot from the members, and this is going back several months, like 250,000 is not a lot of money.

418
00:33:32,938 --> 00:33:39,266
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if they still have money available, but that is a potential that we could go back.

419
00:33:39,606 --> 00:33:45,774
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we have to go back with the need to show that we have applications coming in.

420
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,323
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just throwing it out there, putting that spaghetti to the wall.

421
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:54,346
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's enough there.

422
00:33:54,366 --> 00:34:02,693
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I've seen per unit right now, cost per unit, is it anywhere from $650,000 to $750,000.

423
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:10,002
[SPEAKER_07]: a unit for subsidies.

424
00:34:10,942 --> 00:34:15,345
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's a lot of money, right?

425
00:34:16,006 --> 00:34:18,767
[SPEAKER_07]: So what I'm hearing is a couple of things.

426
00:34:19,388 --> 00:34:26,232
[SPEAKER_07]: We're doing an awesome job telling people that we're here and we want to help with the development.

427
00:34:26,292 --> 00:34:27,013
[SPEAKER_07]: So yay.

428
00:34:33,524 --> 00:34:38,046
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm thinking about given what we need to know, it would be really helpful for us to spell out a timeline.

429
00:34:38,526 --> 00:34:51,452
[SPEAKER_07]: And so perhaps the things that I described that this group needs to agree on, we might be able to do over the three months of April, May, June, and then maybe aim for another public meeting in July.

430
00:34:51,932 --> 00:34:53,073
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we could

431
00:34:58,687 --> 00:35:04,069
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, present our final report to City Council in August.

432
00:35:04,349 --> 00:35:17,493
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if City Council is meeting in August, if they'd be willing to hear us then, or we might have to wait until September, but at that point, we will have already needed to finalize our plan, so that would be a courtesy presentation.

433
00:35:17,513 --> 00:35:23,555
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, then that means that August, like,

434
00:35:24,097 --> 00:35:38,797
[SPEAKER_07]: We could give them the application so they could start working on it, but as of August, like we can officially say these are guidelines and then be able to make to approve something in August or September.

435
00:35:39,578 --> 00:35:40,079
[SPEAKER_07]: That would.

436
00:35:41,802 --> 00:36:05,480
[SPEAKER_07]: you mean that when they send in the application, we actually should talk about like how soon we want materials to review before a trust meeting, like a developer coming in, they should be getting the, within a timeframe to the staff, staff's reviewing it, asks the various questions and then get it to the trustees, so the trustees have time to review it.

437
00:36:06,708 --> 00:36:10,411
[SPEAKER_07]: a conversation so we'll have to look at that the time frame as well.

438
00:36:12,072 --> 00:36:21,219
[SPEAKER_07]: That's assuming that they come in with a complete application and we have no questions and then we could vote.

439
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,162
[SPEAKER_07]: Would they be looking for us to vote on that night?

440
00:36:25,282 --> 00:36:29,165
[SPEAKER_07]: That means I've seen trusts that will vote

441
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:45,629
[SPEAKER_07]: on the application that night, and then I had also seen them defer it to the following, but if they need a conditional commitment letter for their one-stop application in October, they're going to need it in September.

442
00:36:46,169 --> 00:36:46,330
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

443
00:36:53,539 --> 00:36:59,162
[SPEAKER_07]: have a fair ground so that all developers can come in here.

444
00:36:59,242 --> 00:36:59,542
[SPEAKER_07]: I just

445
00:37:23,737 --> 00:37:25,577
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to meet in October.

446
00:37:25,677 --> 00:37:27,458
[SPEAKER_07]: Our September meeting will be the third.

447
00:37:28,518 --> 00:37:34,539
[SPEAKER_07]: But we could have a special meeting in between if we have to make a decision for them.

448
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:35,619
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

449
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:45,301
[SPEAKER_01]: Since we're talking about our schedule, I'm just, this is on our agenda, but I'll just show it here if it's easier.

450
00:37:45,682 --> 00:37:47,082
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, something out of order.

451
00:37:54,183 --> 00:37:57,085
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're actually not scheduled to meet in July.

452
00:37:57,245 --> 00:37:58,687
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to change this.

453
00:38:00,308 --> 00:38:01,309
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, please don't.

454
00:38:01,449 --> 00:38:03,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we can save.

455
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:09,395
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

456
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:12,337
[SPEAKER_03]: What such need to happen.

457
00:38:13,238 --> 00:38:18,021
[SPEAKER_03]: What in addition to this document would be need to prepare to post.

458
00:38:19,256 --> 00:38:27,510
[SPEAKER_03]: For folks to respond, I mean, I think that's part of the decisions that hopefully we can make next meeting or in addition to kind of.

459
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:31,196
[SPEAKER_03]: Numbers and just parameters in general, but also, I guess, like.

460
00:38:32,312 --> 00:38:39,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we have a window or rolling admissions and kind of what the admissions materials and timeline need to look like?

461
00:38:39,139 --> 00:38:41,942
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like that's a whole other realm of things we need to decide.

462
00:38:41,962 --> 00:38:44,745
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think great questions.

463
00:38:45,666 --> 00:38:52,232
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think some of those questions would be answered in our action plan that we're working on, right?

464
00:38:55,111 --> 00:39:18,602
[SPEAKER_07]: right now, I've seen trusts that they have been around a little bit longer, they're a little bit more flushed, and they start talking about how much of their funding are they going to put towards development versus other rental assistance programs or whatnot, right now we're just doing development.

465
00:39:18,722 --> 00:39:21,523
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if we're going to put that in our action plan,

466
00:39:22,804 --> 00:39:23,664
[SPEAKER_07]: thinking about it.

467
00:39:23,684 --> 00:39:28,667
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now we're just on the path for development.

468
00:39:29,488 --> 00:39:38,193
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this would be answered in an action plan unless I'm wrong.

469
00:39:38,754 --> 00:39:39,014
[SPEAKER_07]: I think

470
00:39:39,931 --> 00:39:44,514
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm just going back to the things that we need to talk about for the action plan.

471
00:39:44,775 --> 00:39:47,416
[SPEAKER_07]: Mission statement, goals, priority actions.

472
00:39:47,817 --> 00:39:59,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are all things that I feel very comfortable with developing and usually they come first, but they could, we could kind of do it in reverse order so that we answer some of these critical questions.

473
00:39:59,945 --> 00:40:01,907
[SPEAKER_07]: The next thing that we need is

474
00:40:02,803 --> 00:40:08,388
[SPEAKER_07]: Guidelines and procedures and that's what we're talking about now is program guidelines and procedures.

475
00:40:09,229 --> 00:40:14,854
[SPEAKER_07]: So, those in particular, given the expertise that all of you have with.

476
00:40:14,934 --> 00:40:26,724
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, positive developers, it could be helpful if someone else were to take the lead on drafting some guidelines and procedures.

477
00:40:28,048 --> 00:40:44,952
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that we would have this for discussion over those three months, April, May, June, and in whatever order we discuss them, we could be able to answer some of these questions that we're raising right now.

478
00:40:54,006 --> 00:40:55,447
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think I think that makes sense.

479
00:40:55,708 --> 00:40:59,691
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm happy to take another crack guidelines and procedures.

480
00:41:00,412 --> 00:41:15,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, the only other thought I had is that some of the other types of assistance are kind of maybe more flexible, you know, rental assistance or ownership, like there's a lot of other questions, rental, you know,

481
00:41:16,761 --> 00:41:20,683
[SPEAKER_05]: It's boring, but you know, like there's a process laid out that's mostly driven by the state.

482
00:41:21,183 --> 00:41:31,769
[SPEAKER_05]: So I could probably also like just, you know, specify that this is kind of like a rental development procedure, and this is our timeline.

483
00:41:31,829 --> 00:41:38,252
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we could still leave some flexibility for other endeavors and have more flexibility in those areas.

484
00:41:38,352 --> 00:41:43,395
[SPEAKER_05]: We wanted to try to not put everyone in the same box, I guess is what I'm saying.

485
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:55,904
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and also to Lisa's suggestion that we might want to consider a portion for development versus stabilization programs.

486
00:41:56,464 --> 00:42:05,627
[SPEAKER_07]: The CPC has been funding stabilization programs through direct applications to the CPA program over the last four years or so.

487
00:42:06,487 --> 00:42:16,914
[SPEAKER_07]: So it could be possible to coordinate with the CPC to take on that role and maybe see what the funding level and appropriate funding level is.

488
00:42:19,056 --> 00:42:29,423
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that those funds would go to the trust in addition to say the 250 that we got this year for the trust to be the gateway to that money.

489
00:42:38,081 --> 00:42:47,248
[SPEAKER_07]: So we could focus just drafting guidelines and procedures just right now on development applications.

490
00:42:47,769 --> 00:42:57,557
[SPEAKER_07]: And then if we decide that we're able to grow and do stabilization, housing stabilization pieces, then we can focus on that.

491
00:42:58,077 --> 00:42:59,898
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I think that might be a way to do it.

492
00:42:59,918 --> 00:43:05,920
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I also I think, like I said, I did start trying to draft something and I found myself getting bogged down.

493
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:11,241
[SPEAKER_05]: But what are our overall priorities and what are our percentages and how am I going to score any application?

494
00:43:11,261 --> 00:43:13,822
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the bigger picture.

495
00:43:14,702 --> 00:43:21,405
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think if we're if I'm able to narrow like a procedure of guidelines for a certain subset, what we hope to see

496
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:28,381
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah, I think that'll be easier than to try and answer the action plan questions.

497
00:43:28,401 --> 00:43:29,602
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I ended up trying to do.

498
00:43:29,842 --> 00:43:31,443
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't answer these action plan questions.

499
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:33,244
[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't done the action plan yet.

500
00:43:34,005 --> 00:43:38,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, now I can take practice.

501
00:43:39,324 --> 00:43:55,871
[SPEAKER_06]: And then at the end of the calendar, you leave it as is, but if we, you've seen that the developer needs it by, say, by September 20th, and we just need a 48-hour notice to have a special meeting, then we can even do it by Zoom for just that one vote.

502
00:43:56,671 --> 00:44:01,733
[SPEAKER_06]: So we can schedule a 6 to 6.30 meeting on a Wednesday, just as long as we post by Monday at 6.00.

503
00:44:02,754 --> 00:44:04,535
[SPEAKER_06]: We can just do that by Zoom.

504
00:44:04,555 --> 00:44:07,756
[SPEAKER_05]: I think my only two cents about it is that I'm sure that the developers

505
00:44:09,041 --> 00:44:21,084
[SPEAKER_05]: doing the pre-meeting with ELHLC, which is usually over the summer, and then they usually like to hear that they have, and maybe he could just say we have discussions or we're in the process or something, but.

506
00:44:21,844 --> 00:44:32,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully we've been given a vote on it on the 3rd, it's pretty, but if we ever need any more time, we need to do a vote on the 1st, we can always add a special meeting.

507
00:44:32,647 --> 00:44:32,847
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

508
00:44:33,479 --> 00:44:35,460
[SPEAKER_01]: and I could give them a timeline as to when.

509
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:36,481
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, as long as we plan to.

510
00:44:36,501 --> 00:44:44,485
[SPEAKER_06]: We can do the special meeting in July or August, where we're all just, even if you're on vacation, you can hop on for 20 minutes and just take a look.

511
00:44:44,725 --> 00:44:57,031
[SPEAKER_07]: And we could maybe, just thinking, if they're going to present, they would have to maybe try to present in the June meeting.

512
00:45:03,512 --> 00:45:03,919
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

513
00:45:04,411 --> 00:45:13,877
[SPEAKER_07]: public meeting, open meeting law, I feel like we're getting off on the topic of what might have been on the agenda.

514
00:45:13,897 --> 00:45:19,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Are we going to, is that okay that we've kind of gone off the agenda topics?

515
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:21,902
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still talking about funding application.

516
00:45:22,002 --> 00:45:25,464
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that we have... Yeah, we have an agenda for this, but it's fine.

517
00:45:25,524 --> 00:45:25,784
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

518
00:45:25,804 --> 00:45:26,064
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.

519
00:45:26,204 --> 00:45:26,664
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

520
00:45:34,289 --> 00:45:38,739
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you answered my question and it was also 2 questions at once.

521
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:39,962
[SPEAKER_03]: So, in terms of, like.

522
00:45:40,664 --> 00:45:44,292
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want them at the June meeting, then at some point, we have to post.

523
00:45:45,232 --> 00:45:46,193
[SPEAKER_03]: The application.

524
00:45:46,213 --> 00:45:46,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

525
00:45:46,293 --> 00:45:50,435
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we post the application, what's that look like timing wise?

526
00:45:50,515 --> 00:45:55,517
[SPEAKER_03]: And does anything else need to get posted with it that we need to make and decide on before then?

527
00:45:55,717 --> 00:46:00,460
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess it's just like, that seems like it needs to happen sooner than later.

528
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:01,901
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're just putting it out there.

529
00:46:01,941 --> 00:46:02,821
[SPEAKER_03]: When do we need to decide that?

530
00:46:02,841 --> 00:46:04,522
[SPEAKER_03]: And is there anything else we need to decide around it?

531
00:46:04,542 --> 00:46:06,463
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it depends on what they're doing in June.

532
00:46:07,243 --> 00:46:26,829
[SPEAKER_07]: if they're coming in to introduce themselves and introduce their development and not asking for money, just saying, this is who we are, this is where our plan is, we wanna lay the landscape, and then the application comes in.

533
00:46:27,589 --> 00:46:34,171
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I've seen developers do that, introduce themselves, come in, and they're just sort of,

534
00:46:35,977 --> 00:46:39,799
[SPEAKER_07]: setting the table for a potential application.

535
00:46:40,239 --> 00:46:41,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me rephrase, I guess.

536
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:44,781
[SPEAKER_03]: How does the developer get a copy of that application?

537
00:46:45,001 --> 00:46:49,643
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it posted on our website or is it something they ask us and we send it to them?

538
00:46:50,024 --> 00:46:51,204
[SPEAKER_03]: That is my technical question.

539
00:46:51,244 --> 00:46:53,225
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be posted on the website, yes.

540
00:46:53,445 --> 00:46:56,387
[SPEAKER_01]: But that is whenever the board decides that it should be.

541
00:47:00,770 --> 00:47:02,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think the fruit is amended.

542
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:09,736
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there might we might want to have some guidelines and procedures from us just laid out before we post this application.

543
00:47:09,976 --> 00:47:12,418
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you know, maybe like a super minimal.

544
00:47:12,778 --> 00:47:17,081
[SPEAKER_05]: This is like your steps and then and then we could post it with us.

545
00:47:17,281 --> 00:47:19,243
[SPEAKER_07]: And do we have to do an RFP?

546
00:47:23,206 --> 00:47:24,086
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's so.

547
00:47:27,874 --> 00:47:30,476
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, people don't know that we have money.

548
00:47:30,896 --> 00:47:36,140
[SPEAKER_07]: It depends on how we decide to do it.

549
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:42,504
[SPEAKER_07]: Are we going to take applications on a rolling basis and do a first-come, first-served?

550
00:47:42,544 --> 00:47:43,524
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

551
00:47:43,544 --> 00:47:45,746
[SPEAKER_07]: Or are we going to do an RFP?

552
00:47:46,746 --> 00:47:57,113
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounds like there might be another developer out there who might be a change, so we need to know what we have in front of us.

553
00:47:57,533 --> 00:48:00,494
[SPEAKER_01]: We could issue a notice.

554
00:48:00,534 --> 00:48:04,014
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are valid questions.

555
00:48:04,174 --> 00:48:12,636
[SPEAKER_01]: We could issue a notice of funding availability, NOFA, and then as part of NOFA, we can have the application guidelines and the application form.

556
00:48:12,696 --> 00:48:15,597
[SPEAKER_01]: So then everybody knows that we have the funding.

557
00:48:16,757 --> 00:48:21,578
[SPEAKER_07]: So we need to do all of that by June so we can do the NOFA and have the application.

558
00:48:24,075 --> 00:48:25,176
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a couple of suggestions.

559
00:48:25,236 --> 00:48:32,101
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this is all definitely part of what was on the agenda to discuss.

560
00:48:33,502 --> 00:48:37,265
[SPEAKER_07]: So back to our process for the action plan.

561
00:48:37,945 --> 00:48:43,550
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe we can say April we can discuss the mission statement goals and priority actions.

562
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:50,175
[SPEAKER_07]: And that way you will feel like you have the information that you need in May

563
00:48:50,671 --> 00:48:56,597
[SPEAKER_07]: To have the guidelines and procedures for us to discuss and then June.

564
00:48:57,258 --> 00:49:03,080
[SPEAKER_07]: We can have the whole draft together to look at as a group.

565
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:07,401
[SPEAKER_07]: And then that draft could be posted for public view.

566
00:49:07,421 --> 00:49:18,145
[SPEAKER_07]: And then in later June or early July, and I think we should put a date on the calendar now, have the public meeting to review the draft.

567
00:49:18,665 --> 00:49:22,947
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's commit to actually having the draft ready to release in June.

568
00:49:27,383 --> 00:49:41,831
[SPEAKER_07]: So we could have, we could make the applications, put out a NOFA, make the application available and say preliminary applications process based on the action plan, which is in progress.

569
00:49:42,411 --> 00:49:53,757
[SPEAKER_07]: And like have some qualifications saying that final terms and guidelines will be determined or are to be determined.

570
00:49:54,475 --> 00:50:05,500
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we can create in that a timeline saying that the CPC can make a decision as early as August.

571
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:13,143
[SPEAKER_07]: So we can make a decision in like as early as the earliest August.

572
00:50:16,105 --> 00:50:23,048
[SPEAKER_07]: And then working backward from there, when do they need to submit the materials in order for us to make a decision in August?

573
00:50:28,138 --> 00:50:33,379
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it goes back to whether or not they're going to have a July meeting.

574
00:50:33,419 --> 00:50:40,160
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they could submit the materials to us, and those could be distributed by our staff person without us having a meeting.

575
00:50:47,741 --> 00:50:48,342
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me break it.

576
00:50:48,362 --> 00:50:48,762
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on.

577
00:50:50,982 --> 00:50:51,542
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't cut.

578
00:50:54,583 --> 00:50:56,443
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything's not going to be ready until June.

579
00:50:57,425 --> 00:51:03,293
[SPEAKER_07]: The NOFA, the prelim application, the final thing will go out in June.

580
00:51:03,854 --> 00:51:06,818
[SPEAKER_07]: The NOFA can go out anytime.

581
00:51:07,867 --> 00:51:14,231
[SPEAKER_07]: But it'll say it's preliminary based on the plan that will be completed in June.

582
00:51:14,371 --> 00:51:24,937
[SPEAKER_07]: So that lets them start preparing, but with an understanding that there's still some question marks that are going to be filled in.

583
00:51:25,118 --> 00:51:30,321
[SPEAKER_07]: And they will know the date of when the draft will be released.

584
00:51:36,264 --> 00:51:36,665
[SPEAKER_07]: And then,

585
00:51:38,875 --> 00:51:46,439
[SPEAKER_01]: Would the board, sorry, just because I said, would the board require to vote for the NOFA to be publicly available?

586
00:51:46,979 --> 00:51:52,242
[SPEAKER_01]: Or was the vote that we just had is good enough for us to issue a NOFA?

587
00:52:01,747 --> 00:52:03,348
[SPEAKER_01]: Notice of funding availability?

588
00:52:07,105 --> 00:52:09,666
[SPEAKER_07]: So we can push out the, we can.

589
00:52:09,686 --> 00:52:14,288
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so let me again, I'm sorry I'm slow on the uptake.

590
00:52:14,449 --> 00:52:18,010
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been going all day like everybody else.

591
00:52:18,210 --> 00:52:23,353
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so if we do the NOFA.

592
00:52:25,568 --> 00:52:35,072
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're in March right now, let's just say the NOFA goes out because it's a prelim saying that this is it, we've got money, we're gonna start looking at it.

593
00:52:35,732 --> 00:52:41,494
[SPEAKER_07]: What I'm hearing, I think I'm hearing, is we can do that anytime we want.

594
00:52:43,195 --> 00:52:48,017
[SPEAKER_07]: Put that out, like we could do it sometime in March.

595
00:52:49,597 --> 00:52:51,138
[SPEAKER_07]: So the NOFA goes out in March.

596
00:52:53,050 --> 00:52:56,573
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if it goes out in March.

597
00:52:58,035 --> 00:53:06,042
[SPEAKER_07]: And then our action plan is completed by the end of June.

598
00:53:06,062 --> 00:53:09,686
[SPEAKER_07]: The draft is completed end of June.

599
00:53:09,726 --> 00:53:10,486
[SPEAKER_07]: Draft, sorry.

600
00:53:12,892 --> 00:53:17,415
[SPEAKER_07]: So I cannot come up with a schedule that allows us to have no summer meetings.

601
00:53:17,435 --> 00:53:19,456
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we can't skip them.

602
00:53:19,997 --> 00:53:24,580
[SPEAKER_07]: Next year we can skip them, but this year we kind of have to.

603
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:34,606
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I was getting confused with, because I don't think that we could have somebody come in and do a presentation

604
00:53:35,567 --> 00:53:39,548
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would prefer to do a presentation in person.

605
00:53:41,128 --> 00:53:42,348
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just my preference.

606
00:53:42,368 --> 00:53:44,749
[SPEAKER_07]: We could do a hybrid if necessary.

607
00:53:47,309 --> 00:54:00,372
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so then they can present in June and then we can vote if it doesn't happen in June and happen at a special meeting.

608
00:54:02,052 --> 00:54:03,172
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thank you.

609
00:54:03,192 --> 00:54:04,753
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry to take so much time.

610
00:54:04,813 --> 00:54:07,073
[SPEAKER_07]: I just had to walk through it.

611
00:54:07,213 --> 00:54:08,194
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a suggestion.

612
00:54:08,274 --> 00:54:13,115
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the board should have a look at the NOFA document before it's issued.

613
00:54:13,435 --> 00:54:18,877
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would be hard for it to go out in March because the next board meeting is April.

614
00:54:18,937 --> 00:54:20,217
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when you probably have to

615
00:54:21,291 --> 00:54:22,252
[SPEAKER_02]: approve it.

616
00:54:22,932 --> 00:54:25,774
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can be posted.

617
00:54:26,095 --> 00:54:30,878
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have to have the agenda in April already and we're not done with this meeting.

618
00:54:30,898 --> 00:54:36,242
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just want to review like the local timeline is going to be.

619
00:54:36,342 --> 00:54:40,725
[SPEAKER_07]: Goals and NOFA we're going to discuss in April.

620
00:54:42,106 --> 00:54:44,688
[SPEAKER_07]: Guidelines and procedures we discuss in May.

621
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:52,045
[SPEAKER_07]: We look at the draft plan and maybe we have a second, oh, somebody can come and give us a presentation in June.

622
00:54:52,185 --> 00:55:00,191
[SPEAKER_07]: So a draft plan, we discuss, say, yep, this looks good, and we have a presentation from a developer in June.

623
00:55:01,512 --> 00:55:06,556
[SPEAKER_07]: And then that draft plan gets posted on the city's website.

624
00:55:07,156 --> 00:55:12,220
[SPEAKER_07]: And in July, we're going to have another community meeting.

625
00:55:15,801 --> 00:55:27,567
[SPEAKER_07]: And then in August, we're going to have a meeting where we approve any final changes and make the plan final.

626
00:55:27,727 --> 00:55:32,929
[SPEAKER_07]: So final plan is released in August, and in August, we're going to make a decision.

627
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:43,895
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're going to be submitting their materials based on our draft plan, but hopefully it'll be close enough to what's going to be final.

628
00:55:44,486 --> 00:55:46,207
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's why it's called preliminary.

629
00:55:46,267 --> 00:55:53,271
[SPEAKER_07]: Next year, we'll be able to have more definitive guidelines.

630
00:55:54,711 --> 00:55:56,092
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think so.

631
00:55:56,192 --> 00:56:02,015
[SPEAKER_07]: If we were to put actual dates to those things, that might work out for these.

632
00:56:04,776 --> 00:56:06,237
[SPEAKER_04]: Does she have for May again?

633
00:56:06,697 --> 00:56:11,360
[SPEAKER_07]: May is going to be discussing guidelines and procedures.

634
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:14,690
[SPEAKER_01]: and NOFA.

635
00:56:15,451 --> 00:56:18,612
[SPEAKER_07]: April is the mission goals priority actions and the NOFA.

636
00:56:45,015 --> 00:56:52,099
[SPEAKER_01]: So Kayla, just to clarify, I'm assuming NOFA will be part of the Midland Network.

637
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:55,141
[SPEAKER_01]: I can send you some examples if you, yeah.

638
00:56:55,322 --> 00:56:55,682
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

639
00:56:55,702 --> 00:56:56,242
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

640
00:56:58,424 --> 00:57:00,285
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you sign up from one of these sites?

641
00:57:00,365 --> 00:57:02,446
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you done the guidelines before?

642
00:57:02,566 --> 00:57:05,208
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's so much good stuff online.

643
00:57:05,288 --> 00:57:05,769
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

644
00:57:05,849 --> 00:57:05,969
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

645
00:57:14,690 --> 00:57:33,649
[SPEAKER_07]: I have program guidelines from stabilization programs that I've helped to set up, and program guidelines for affordable housing trusts to guide development projects, but maybe not really applicable to Welfare.

646
00:57:34,614 --> 00:57:43,296
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll look to see what we have, what Somerville has for guidelines and reviewing applications, and I'll send them through.

647
00:58:04,769 --> 00:58:05,049
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

648
00:58:08,253 --> 00:58:12,279
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so item number four.

649
00:58:13,868 --> 00:58:16,290
[SPEAKER_07]: funding and development on affordable housing.

650
00:58:17,271 --> 00:58:28,519
[SPEAKER_07]: The city council has invited the board of trustees to the committee of the whole meeting to discuss the request to transfer and convey the reformed parcels to fund affordable housing.

651
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:42,030
[SPEAKER_07]: In advance of the meeting, the board would like to discuss the understanding and context of the conveyance of the parcels and review the other options that could provide funding for the next study.

652
00:58:46,145 --> 00:58:57,911
[SPEAKER_06]: This is back in 2018 and 2019, there was an interested party on one of the McCormick Ave lots.

653
00:58:58,211 --> 00:59:10,157
[SPEAKER_06]: So since that time and after I became mayor, worked with Alicia Hunt and Danielle Evans helped as well figure out what parcels we have in the city that

654
00:59:10,763 --> 00:59:16,446
[SPEAKER_06]: either could build affordable housing on or potentially sell to then be able to put money into the affordable housing projects.

655
00:59:18,327 --> 00:59:28,893
[SPEAKER_06]: And this parcel, I thought, since there is an interested buyer in at least one of the lots, we wanted to make it a buildable lot.

656
00:59:28,933 --> 00:59:36,116
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're taking both lots and have it before the council to set up terms to sell both lots.

657
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:46,813
[SPEAKER_06]: and the values in the 700,000 range for the two, and we're gonna set minimums as my hope.

658
00:59:46,833 --> 01:00:08,167
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm spending a good amount of money into the Affordable Housing Trust, and that's, I know some of you have lots, maybe a potential for an affordable housing builder, but this is a way to get money in our account and linkage access to try to create an affordable housing section in our linkage intake.

659
01:00:10,585 --> 01:00:10,825
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

660
01:00:11,666 --> 01:00:20,795
[SPEAKER_01]: So we haven't scheduled it yet because the board would want to discuss it before we go.

661
01:00:22,647 --> 01:00:23,288
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I understand?

662
01:00:23,308 --> 01:00:28,494
[SPEAKER_03]: So they want to meet ahead of time with us and then have us at the committee of the whole.

663
01:00:28,514 --> 01:00:29,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that the understanding?

664
01:00:29,736 --> 01:00:30,377
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

665
01:00:30,497 --> 01:00:30,957
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

666
01:00:31,278 --> 01:00:38,707
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to meet, discuss, and then propose a time when the board is prepared to go before the committee of the whole.

667
01:00:39,107 --> 01:00:39,368
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

668
01:00:39,568 --> 01:00:39,808
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

669
01:00:45,162 --> 01:00:49,185
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not clear, but they said the board of trustees here.

670
01:00:49,205 --> 01:00:59,252
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, because initially this is like a special meeting to talk about this right and then like the way the schedule works out it's on our regular schedule, but hard.

671
01:01:01,457 --> 01:01:10,284
[SPEAKER_03]: To me, an unanswered question was like, if there's a strategy and in meeting with them, because of concerns that were raised about, I think, like.

672
01:01:10,764 --> 01:01:14,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it the wording of the transfer or something that came up in the meeting that.

673
01:01:14,847 --> 01:01:21,532
[SPEAKER_03]: We wanted to make sure we were all on the same page going into a meeting just to either ask what needs clarifying or like.

674
01:01:22,823 --> 01:01:26,269
[SPEAKER_06]: And then he handed the request is for other options.

675
01:01:26,289 --> 01:01:30,255
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, we could send them a statement and see if that would suffice.

676
01:01:30,295 --> 01:01:34,361
[SPEAKER_06]: So we get some of the vote that you agree with this proposal and you'd like them to set.

677
01:01:35,463 --> 01:01:42,605
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not, we don't usually sell property, although the prior mayors have done it in the past.

678
01:01:43,225 --> 01:01:56,930
[SPEAKER_06]: So you all may be more educated on what we would put in a vote to approve or ask them to do this so that we can add some money to the Affordable Housing Trust to do the linkage nexus study, and then some.

679
01:01:57,010 --> 01:01:57,590
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the study's 80,000.

680
01:01:57,630 --> 01:02:04,872
[SPEAKER_06]: If we could put a half million in from this sale into our trust, I mean, it's a whole lot of,

681
01:02:06,094 --> 01:02:22,528
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

682
01:02:34,758 --> 01:02:38,320
[SPEAKER_01]: totaling up to $720,000 each.

683
01:02:39,101 --> 01:02:46,007
[SPEAKER_01]: Daniel and I met with the chief assessor this morning to understand how these city-owned parcels are assessed.

684
01:02:46,067 --> 01:02:50,090
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to give you some background about it, there's a cost curve factor.

685
01:02:51,111 --> 01:02:52,652
[SPEAKER_01]: You may already be familiar with that.

686
01:02:53,673 --> 01:02:59,017
[SPEAKER_01]: The rate of the value of the land diminishes as the land area increases.

687
01:03:00,618 --> 01:03:16,102
[SPEAKER_01]: And they also consider some sort of condition factors like accessibility and whether it's developable or not, and any other environmental factors that could impact the value of the land.

688
01:03:16,902 --> 01:03:26,885
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's also a certain threshold, a threshold of 8,000 square feet beyond which the rate of the value of the land is lower than

689
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:30,541
[SPEAKER_01]: The area of land up to 8,000.

690
01:03:31,022 --> 01:03:39,651
[SPEAKER_01]: So, if that makes sense, so there's a certain rate for land area up to 8,000 and beyond 8,000, it's a lower rate.

691
01:03:39,672 --> 01:03:40,032
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

692
01:03:41,133 --> 01:03:42,655
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition to the cost curve.

693
01:03:44,056 --> 01:03:44,837
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um.

694
01:03:46,491 --> 01:03:56,593
[SPEAKER_01]: We digged a little deeper and then we were wondering why McCormick Avenue parcels are valued at this because these individual lot themselves are not developable.

695
01:03:57,614 --> 01:04:02,775
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the SSS office data, it's considered as developable.

696
01:04:02,835 --> 01:04:12,057
[SPEAKER_01]: That is probably a mistake because the land area of each of this parcel is 3,600 square feet and it's an undersized lot.

697
01:04:14,281 --> 01:04:23,527
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we just did some trial and error to see if these two lots were merged, then it would be developable like Mayor mentioned.

698
01:04:24,268 --> 01:04:27,890
[SPEAKER_01]: Then approximately this land would be valued at $435,000 and not $720,000.

699
01:04:36,657 --> 01:04:47,254
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the suggestion is to have this land appraised to see the actual value of the land before we convey the parcels because

700
01:04:48,691 --> 01:04:54,653
[SPEAKER_01]: how the land has been assessed so far is different because they are individual parcels and not merged.

701
01:04:54,793 --> 01:04:57,815
[SPEAKER_01]: And once you merge, probably the land value is going to change.

702
01:04:58,235 --> 01:04:59,295
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't know what that is.

703
01:05:00,095 --> 01:05:07,258
[SPEAKER_01]: And the chief assessor is of the opinion that they don't do the appraisal of the land because then it's a conflict of interest.

704
01:05:07,918 --> 01:05:11,420
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's usually a third party that would come in and assess the land.

705
01:05:12,140 --> 01:05:19,779
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not sure if that is something that we'd want to do and see what this land is valued at.

706
01:05:24,167 --> 01:05:25,748
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have two parcels of land.

707
01:05:25,988 --> 01:05:26,208
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

708
01:05:26,749 --> 01:05:28,090
[SPEAKER_07]: Each parcel of land is $300, $250, $300.

709
01:05:28,330 --> 01:05:30,831
[SPEAKER_07]: And then if we merge them, did I hear you say that they could possibly go down to $400,000?

710
01:05:30,871 --> 01:05:31,892
[SPEAKER_07]: $435,000 as per the SSS office.

711
01:05:31,952 --> 01:05:32,072
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

712
01:05:32,352 --> 01:05:32,993
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

713
01:05:47,497 --> 01:06:01,466
[SPEAKER_01]: That's because of the cost curve factor, so they become larger lots, and then the value per square footage is... But also, I think the $700,000 number is probably incorrect because of the incorrect coding.

714
01:06:02,027 --> 01:06:04,028
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's considered as developable.

715
01:06:04,048 --> 01:06:04,228
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

716
01:06:04,388 --> 01:06:10,772
[SPEAKER_05]: So right now, they're not really worth $700,000, but right now, they're carrying them at $700,000 in the assessor's logs.

717
01:06:11,293 --> 01:06:14,235
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think the abutting lots are valued at...

718
01:06:15,629 --> 01:06:17,932
[SPEAKER_01]: 35,000 or something like that.

719
01:06:18,332 --> 01:06:18,632
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

720
01:06:19,073 --> 01:06:21,655
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have a potential buyer for the 700.

721
01:06:22,075 --> 01:06:32,565
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a buyer for one of the lots, so I'm assuming that person owns an adjacent lot.

722
01:06:33,026 --> 01:06:34,527
[SPEAKER_06]: We were trying to be fair and get

723
01:06:37,069 --> 01:06:39,932
[SPEAKER_06]: do a full bid process and not just sell to one person.

724
01:06:40,312 --> 01:06:45,656
[SPEAKER_06]: So PBS recommended we sell them both, which I'm fine with.

725
01:06:45,696 --> 01:06:47,057
[SPEAKER_06]: I want it to be a fair process.

726
01:06:47,317 --> 01:06:56,965
[SPEAKER_06]: I just feel like we have somebody interested, we need money in our political housing trust to build on other lots and give money to other developers.

727
01:06:57,025 --> 01:07:01,288
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've been following the process to do it fairly and transparently.

728
01:07:02,213 --> 01:07:05,676
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, maybe if I just make sure I understand it right.

729
01:07:05,716 --> 01:07:07,858
[SPEAKER_03]: So it seems like someone's interested in one.

730
01:07:08,699 --> 01:07:13,984
[SPEAKER_03]: But if someone were to get one, the other one's too small to do anything with.

731
01:07:14,424 --> 01:07:24,634
[SPEAKER_03]: So to move forward at all and get a profit, it's that lower number is what sort of seems like.

732
01:07:25,903 --> 01:07:27,364
[SPEAKER_01]: The expectation, right?

733
01:07:27,484 --> 01:07:31,546
[SPEAKER_01]: To move forward, it's better for the city to sell both the parcels.

734
01:07:31,906 --> 01:07:37,609
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we would just be left with one undeveloped lot.

735
01:07:37,729 --> 01:07:45,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we think the interested party would bite at a combined two lots?

736
01:07:45,673 --> 01:07:46,153
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know.

737
01:07:46,333 --> 01:07:55,358
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't know, but no matter what, one of those two lots is adjacent to the land that they own, so I think it's a possibility.

738
01:07:56,058 --> 01:07:56,298
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

739
01:07:58,941 --> 01:08:00,802
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a question.

740
01:08:01,403 --> 01:08:15,996
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember reading in the housing production plan a recommendation to have zoning that would maybe allow affordable development on these undersized lots.

741
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:29,614
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, this is the conversation that we have been having, but I'm not sure as part of the zoning overhaul if they have really included that as part of the zoning ordinance yet.

742
01:08:30,135 --> 01:08:34,139
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's an ongoing process, but hopefully we'll have that.

743
01:08:38,837 --> 01:08:49,100
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a few other options also just so that the board is aware if that's something that you'd like to explore.

744
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:55,561
[SPEAKER_01]: There's undevelopable parcel on 0 Tresor Ave.

745
01:08:55,781 --> 01:09:05,464
[SPEAKER_01]: Tresor Ave is a paper waste street, so it's considered undevelopable parcel and the abutting property owner is interested to

746
01:09:07,965 --> 01:09:13,729
[SPEAKER_01]: by this adjacent property and it's currently valued at $31,200.

747
01:09:17,172 --> 01:09:22,957
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's also the Zero Riverside Ave and this is a landlocked property.

748
01:09:24,439 --> 01:09:26,860
[SPEAKER_01]: A developer is interested to build housing.

749
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:36,885
[SPEAKER_01]: If we were to convey this to that developer, they would just merge this whole land and build around 30 affordable housing units.

750
01:09:38,365 --> 01:09:40,366
[SPEAKER_01]: I think initially they had

751
01:09:41,887 --> 01:09:54,754
[SPEAKER_01]: agreed to provide 25% of the housing development as affordable, and then they would come in as a friendly 40B because now the zoning doesn't allow for development of that scale.

752
01:09:55,914 --> 01:10:10,222
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we were to convey the parcel at market rate, then maybe, I don't know if we can still enforce the affordability restrictions when we convey, but maybe we could still say that you are required to build housing.

753
01:10:11,338 --> 01:10:15,859
[SPEAKER_01]: in that property, so that's another option.

754
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:21,241
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have the Bailey Street lots.

755
01:10:21,481 --> 01:10:37,545
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there are two city-owned parcels that are valued at $33,000 each, but again, if we merge those like similar to McCormick parcels, then probably the value would change, and we didn't check with the SSS office how much that would be valued at.

756
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:50,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you be able to develop a list and a description of all of these units that we can include in the in the action plan?

757
01:10:50,625 --> 01:10:50,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

758
01:10:51,225 --> 01:10:51,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

759
01:10:52,005 --> 01:10:52,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

760
01:10:59,793 --> 01:11:00,814
[SPEAKER_05]: What was the initial question?

761
01:11:01,114 --> 01:11:05,155
[SPEAKER_05]: So the city council wants one of us or all of us to come.

762
01:11:06,735 --> 01:11:08,836
[SPEAKER_07]: I think a representative would be fine.

763
01:11:09,716 --> 01:11:11,237
[SPEAKER_07]: So what are they looking for?

764
01:11:11,337 --> 01:11:14,518
[SPEAKER_07]: Are they looking for us to say, no, we don't want the money.

765
01:11:14,578 --> 01:11:15,518
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't want the $700,000 from McCormick.

766
01:11:15,538 --> 01:11:16,379
[SPEAKER_07]: We want to take $30,000.

767
01:11:16,439 --> 01:11:18,919
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're interested, I think we'd send a motion.

768
01:11:27,570 --> 01:11:37,497
[SPEAKER_06]: potentially draft a resolution, a motion that were somewhat in approval and maybe invite them to our next meeting to discuss it with us.

769
01:11:39,158 --> 01:11:42,440
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they can be on Zoom, you know, any of them that want to come can be on Zoom.

770
01:11:42,740 --> 01:11:42,981
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

771
01:11:43,441 --> 01:11:43,661
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

772
01:11:43,801 --> 01:11:47,604
[SPEAKER_03]: And this, we're specifically talking about the McCormick or I think like

773
01:11:48,497 --> 01:11:51,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not all kind of question emerges in my mind?

774
01:11:51,498 --> 01:11:53,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, can we address all of these?

775
01:11:53,619 --> 01:11:59,441
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I guess, I'm afraid I've omitted our guiding principles.

776
01:11:59,521 --> 01:12:01,062
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the time.

777
01:12:01,102 --> 01:12:07,784
[SPEAKER_06]: So since I initially asked the question to PDS, it's been six years.

778
01:12:08,704 --> 01:12:11,786
[SPEAKER_06]: So I, my office, has moved from a clinic.

779
01:12:14,927 --> 01:12:18,330
[SPEAKER_06]: and I'm looking on ways to fund it.

780
01:12:18,790 --> 01:12:21,873
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's an initial, let's do the first one.

781
01:12:21,953 --> 01:12:27,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there going to be an uproar of the neighborhood or an uproar of the city?

782
01:12:27,337 --> 01:12:29,018
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you sell property?

783
01:12:29,118 --> 01:12:31,820
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't know the landscape yet.

784
01:12:31,860 --> 01:12:34,462
[SPEAKER_06]: So I wanted to do one at a time.

785
01:12:34,622 --> 01:12:36,083
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's what PBS was doing.

786
01:12:36,103 --> 01:12:40,386
[SPEAKER_06]: They were looking at everything and it just never, you know, with so much going on, we just never moved forward.

787
01:12:40,406 --> 01:12:41,908
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've done this.

788
01:12:44,443 --> 01:12:49,985
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's gone through the legal steps with Coleman and Page.

789
01:12:50,385 --> 01:12:53,346
[SPEAKER_06]: They've done all the work with the assessing and taken off.

790
01:12:53,386 --> 01:12:59,767
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's been, well, six to nine months to get to the point where we need to go to the city council.

791
01:13:00,468 --> 01:13:06,469
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think the next are probably gonna come in line, even if I have to do that on my own.

792
01:13:06,509 --> 01:13:09,970
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess it's too busy and we need to decide which one comes next.

793
01:13:10,510 --> 01:13:11,571
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, great.

794
01:13:12,211 --> 01:13:12,431
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

795
01:13:16,437 --> 01:13:26,321
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it would be really helpful for us to have some more concrete understanding of the scenarios.

796
01:13:26,341 --> 01:13:41,228
[SPEAKER_07]: So one scenario is that someone buys one of these parcels and the other parcel is then just not marketable unless we have zoning that allows for it to be

797
01:13:41,789 --> 01:13:43,371
[SPEAKER_07]: for housing to be developed there.

798
01:13:44,211 --> 01:13:58,524
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we're going to have housing that allows for affordable housing to be developed there, have we then given up the opportunity for an affordable housing site by selling something for less than it should be valued?

799
01:14:01,047 --> 01:14:06,952
[SPEAKER_07]: So, and how, you know, how much is it going to be worth

800
01:14:08,099 --> 01:14:15,483
[SPEAKER_07]: to sell them both together or just the one parcel given what the appraisal will come in at.

801
01:14:15,503 --> 01:14:20,365
[SPEAKER_07]: So it sounds like it's not going to be $700,000.

802
01:14:20,405 --> 01:14:21,766
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe both of them together might be $400,000, one alone.

803
01:14:21,786 --> 01:14:24,127
[SPEAKER_07]: What is it actually going to be worth?

804
01:14:33,225 --> 01:14:34,225
[SPEAKER_06]: The proposal is not to sell one.

805
01:14:34,245 --> 01:14:35,246
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not a possibility.

806
01:14:35,266 --> 01:14:37,826
[SPEAKER_06]: The way it's before the council now.

807
01:14:37,846 --> 01:14:39,867
[SPEAKER_06]: We figured out it was probably the fairest, cleanest way to do it.

808
01:14:39,907 --> 01:14:45,409
[SPEAKER_06]: If it was sold, do we get to say that it has to have affordable housing on it or can they build anything they want on the wall?

809
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:05,221
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, anything they want, but the money would go.

810
01:15:05,602 --> 01:15:21,129
[SPEAKER_07]: I propose it, the money would go to the affordable housing trust and then you be so we can build affordable housing with the money, you may not get it in this in on this site, but we may be able to get it with a developer.

811
01:15:22,594 --> 01:15:24,714
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's got three developing.

812
01:15:24,814 --> 01:15:26,175
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.

813
01:15:26,635 --> 01:15:34,036
[SPEAKER_07]: And does the zoning that's under discussion right now affect the potential value of this parcel?

814
01:15:34,357 --> 01:15:43,138
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be the proposed zoning is NR1 and it's still going to be single unit dwelling with an ADU.

815
01:15:47,439 --> 01:15:48,600
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

816
01:15:48,660 --> 01:15:50,020
[SPEAKER_03]: This site is not

817
01:15:51,546 --> 01:15:56,289
[SPEAKER_03]: the most ideal buildable location without serious or mean tolls.

818
01:15:56,389 --> 01:15:57,390
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a lot of ledge.

819
01:15:57,650 --> 01:15:58,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

820
01:16:00,291 --> 01:16:00,711
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

821
01:16:01,012 --> 01:16:01,752
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no problem.

822
01:16:02,533 --> 01:16:06,015
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's on the agenda.

823
01:16:06,855 --> 01:16:13,199
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we need a... We discussed it.

824
01:16:13,279 --> 01:16:18,402
[SPEAKER_07]: What is the possible... Do you have the letter or the...

825
01:16:20,475 --> 01:16:22,477
[SPEAKER_05]: document that we discussed last time?

826
01:16:22,898 --> 01:16:23,859
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

827
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:27,302
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll have to disconnect this.

828
01:16:27,462 --> 01:16:29,965
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to find a layer.

829
01:16:45,413 --> 01:16:47,596
[SPEAKER_04]: There's two ways to do it.

830
01:16:47,616 --> 01:16:48,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Put it out to bid.

831
01:17:01,152 --> 01:17:05,955
[SPEAKER_06]: Create the term, put it out to bid, and then before you've sold, we could go to the council for approval.

832
01:17:07,076 --> 01:17:11,679
[SPEAKER_06]: Or I chose the more transparent route, get them to approve even going out to bid.

833
01:17:11,979 --> 01:17:12,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

834
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:15,462
[SPEAKER_06]: Before they would then need to approve the sale.

835
01:17:16,695 --> 01:17:18,356
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's, this is the first step.

836
01:17:18,376 --> 01:17:21,276
[SPEAKER_06]: We are at the fully beginning step, yes.

837
01:17:21,596 --> 01:17:21,977
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

838
01:17:22,537 --> 01:17:36,141
[SPEAKER_06]: Which I didn't have to, we didn't have to take, but we chose to just, because I wanted to know, as a neighborhood, on and on a public agenda, open public communication, in case there was any issues by any chance someone could always pull back.

839
01:17:36,461 --> 01:17:45,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

840
01:18:12,097 --> 01:18:13,613
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, let me know once you.

841
01:18:49,352 --> 01:18:49,936
[SPEAKER_00]: The second page.

842
01:19:31,164 --> 01:19:43,209
[SPEAKER_03]: As I remember it, there was kind of a honing in on the may be used versus will be used and the exact intention of the use, but I might be misremembering that attention.

843
01:19:43,269 --> 01:19:43,849
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess.

844
01:19:44,850 --> 01:19:49,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, strategically, what is like, an understanding that like.

845
01:19:50,602 --> 01:19:57,206
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what we understand is going to be used for and we support this use and this proposal, I guess.

846
01:19:57,786 --> 01:19:59,387
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, what do we think?

847
01:20:00,408 --> 01:20:17,237
[SPEAKER_06]: I would do a motion to approve the disposition of this parcel land if the money proceeds are going to go into the Affordable Housing Trust, which will then be by vote of the board.

848
01:20:18,029 --> 01:20:22,211
[SPEAKER_06]: to be used for things like the linkage review.

849
01:20:27,693 --> 01:20:28,453
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a motion.

850
01:20:28,493 --> 01:20:30,814
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, second.

851
01:20:30,934 --> 01:20:36,436
[SPEAKER_06]: And then also we can write to the council that, you know, we've discussed it, we've reviewed it.

852
01:20:37,177 --> 01:20:44,740
[SPEAKER_06]: We're happy to invite them to an upcoming meeting if they want to discuss it more with us.

853
01:20:48,113 --> 01:20:51,556
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that before the committee of the whole meeting that we invite them?

854
01:20:51,576 --> 01:20:53,458
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they invited them.

855
01:20:53,478 --> 01:20:58,283
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I can talk to the president too and just say, what's the premise of having us there?

856
01:20:58,303 --> 01:21:00,024
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we voted to approve it.

857
01:21:00,264 --> 01:21:05,689
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we need a meeting or did you want to come talk to us about terms of sale?

858
01:21:07,771 --> 01:21:13,156
[SPEAKER_06]: I can talk to him on the phone and get him and the vice president on the side and see what they're looking for as far as meeting.

859
01:21:14,860 --> 01:21:22,722
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, a question on why we would need to motion to approve the sale.

860
01:21:23,582 --> 01:21:24,582
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to support it.

861
01:21:24,662 --> 01:21:27,303
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we want it on this proposal.

862
01:21:27,423 --> 01:21:29,584
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, sorry, that makes sense.

863
01:21:29,664 --> 01:21:31,524
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to support the sale.

864
01:21:32,024 --> 01:21:32,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

865
01:21:32,604 --> 01:21:39,006
[SPEAKER_06]: To support the approval by the City Council of the sale, transfer, and authorize the sale of McCormick Ave.

866
01:21:40,426 --> 01:21:47,749
[SPEAKER_07]: for the purposes of funding the housing trust fund that may develop housing and fund an access study.

867
01:21:47,769 --> 01:21:50,790
[SPEAKER_07]: We all want an access study, as does the council.

868
01:21:50,930 --> 01:21:55,011
[SPEAKER_07]: The council alone is leading the charge on that.

869
01:22:09,779 --> 01:22:10,799
[SPEAKER_06]: I can jump into it.

870
01:22:11,060 --> 01:22:11,280
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

871
01:22:11,300 --> 01:22:12,060
[SPEAKER_06]: Share the site.

872
01:22:13,901 --> 01:22:16,561
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't seen it in a while.

873
01:22:16,862 --> 01:22:18,302
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's what I was going to say.

874
01:22:18,362 --> 01:22:18,722
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

875
01:22:18,742 --> 01:22:19,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

876
01:22:19,703 --> 01:22:23,844
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that, I'm hoping it will, in a second, it's obviously happening.

877
01:22:24,184 --> 01:22:25,505
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you guys get the motion?

878
01:22:25,525 --> 01:22:27,405
[SPEAKER_07]: It was, okay.

879
01:22:28,666 --> 01:22:34,148
[SPEAKER_07]: So we got a motion, we got, Penny is a second, a second motion, was that correct, Penny?

880
01:22:34,248 --> 01:22:34,548
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct.

881
01:22:34,828 --> 01:22:35,228
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

882
01:22:35,528 --> 01:22:36,708
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll do a roll call.

883
01:22:37,129 --> 01:22:37,589
[SPEAKER_07]: Kayla?

884
01:22:37,969 --> 01:22:38,089
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

885
01:22:38,843 --> 01:22:39,403
[SPEAKER_07]: Roberta?

886
01:22:39,423 --> 01:22:40,183
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

887
01:22:40,503 --> 01:22:40,923
[SPEAKER_07]: Carrie?

01:22:40,943 --> 01:22:43,204
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Carrie Leno.

01:22:45,765 --> 01:22:46,245
[SPEAKER_07]: Lisa?

892
01:22:46,605 --> 01:22:46,845
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

893
01:22:47,545 --> 01:22:48,185
[SPEAKER_07]: Madam Mayor?

894
01:22:48,365 --> 01:22:48,645
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

895
01:22:48,925 --> 01:22:49,605
[SPEAKER_07]: And Lisa?

896
01:22:49,665 --> 01:22:50,065
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

897
01:22:51,386 --> 01:22:54,706
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you will be emailing this to the Council?

898
01:23:02,188 --> 01:23:18,778
[SPEAKER_01]: I can email it to the council, but since I sent an email to President Baer saying that the board would discuss first before we schedule a committee of the whole meeting, so I'm not sure if... Lizzie, let me in and then I'll just say, hey, can we talk on the phone for five minutes?

899
01:23:18,818 --> 01:23:22,260
[SPEAKER_06]: We just want to get a better idea of what you want from the board.

900
01:23:24,501 --> 01:23:44,831
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah I know whichever way you want because I know the chair and vice-chair were cc'd on that email as well yeah so whichever yeah no when I requested yeah yeah I requested president best to give us give the board some time to discuss about this before we schedule a meeting at the committee of the whole so

901
01:23:46,592 --> 01:23:54,560
[SPEAKER_07]: And if they want somebody at the board, at the committee of the whole, I'm happy to attend as part of, you know, as Justin said.

902
01:23:54,840 --> 01:24:02,968
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, if they don't want the whole board to come, and then we'd have to schedule it as a joint meeting, or do you just want a representative or two?

903
01:24:02,988 --> 01:24:07,512
[SPEAKER_06]: We took a vote, we took this motion, so I'll talk to them.

904
01:24:07,532 --> 01:24:09,514
[SPEAKER_06]: So see me when you send them, like, this is what the

905
01:24:10,815 --> 01:24:23,081
[SPEAKER_06]: board of housing trust voted for, CC and the mayor, you and her can just discuss, you know, whether it's a joint meeting or a representation at your committee level, you know.

906
01:24:25,722 --> 01:24:26,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

907
01:24:26,942 --> 01:24:32,065
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to say this, I know this is going to be, seems like more meetings for us in general, nevermind, so yeah.

908
01:24:32,765 --> 01:24:33,585
[SPEAKER_06]: Appreciate that.

909
01:24:38,577 --> 01:24:45,260
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so the next item on the agenda was trust meeting schedule, but we took that out of order.

910
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:47,581
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yes, we need an approval.

911
01:24:47,841 --> 01:24:51,103
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, just a question from the chairs.

912
01:24:51,583 --> 01:24:56,345
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you thinking about and then the July 2nd, just so we can all be able to have our calendars.

913
01:24:59,408 --> 01:25:02,569
[SPEAKER_06]: One second.

914
01:25:02,889 --> 01:25:09,231
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a problem with the summer then you could wait when I can do the second I just can't do the ninth.

915
01:25:10,951 --> 01:25:11,471
[SPEAKER_06]: I can do this.

916
01:25:13,552 --> 01:25:16,893
[SPEAKER_06]: So, unless you do one meeting in the summer and it's the 16th or 23rd type.

917
01:25:18,835 --> 01:25:26,880
[SPEAKER_07]: But what I would suggest is maybe it doesn't have to be on the 2nd, but sometime in July, we have a public meeting and that will be the July meeting.

918
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:30,762
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so if we could pick a date for a public meeting in July.

919
01:25:30,782 --> 01:25:35,864
[SPEAKER_07]: 16, I heard the 16th that works.

920
01:25:35,924 --> 01:25:36,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

921
01:25:36,805 --> 01:25:40,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that works for me.

922
01:25:40,387 --> 01:25:46,190
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that the action plan group will start planning that meeting pretty soon and maybe conjunction with our awesome staff.

923
01:25:55,878 --> 01:25:59,379
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's an amendment to the meeting in April.

924
01:26:00,240 --> 01:26:06,802
[SPEAKER_01]: Last time when I presented it, I said April 9th will be the next meeting, but it's on April 2nd.

925
01:26:08,243 --> 01:26:11,184
[SPEAKER_01]: But you've got an updated invite for April 2nd.

926
01:26:12,164 --> 01:26:16,426
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion for approval as amended of the meeting schedule.

927
01:26:17,773 --> 01:26:18,674
[SPEAKER_06]: Anybody second it?

928
01:26:20,274 --> 01:26:20,595
[SPEAKER_07]: Second.

929
01:26:22,836 --> 01:26:23,456

[SPEAKER_07]: That's six.

943
01:26:37,484 --> 01:26:38,865
[SPEAKER_07]: Elaine is two percent.

944
01:26:39,665 --> 01:26:40,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Six, one absent.

945
01:26:41,206 --> 01:26:41,747
[SPEAKER_07]: All approved.

01:26:41,767 --> 01:26:42,847
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

[SPEAKER_01]: I've learned so much along the way, and thank you for your guidance and patience as you worked with me for the past couple of months.

951
01:27:36,388 --> 01:27:40,411
[SPEAKER_03]: That's such a strong foundation and so much of it is through your efforts.
