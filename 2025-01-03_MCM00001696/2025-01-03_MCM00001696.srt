00:01:58,355 --> 00:02:00,076
[SPEAKER_00]: Meeting adjourned at 6.28 p.m.

39
00:02:02,077 --> 00:02:04,177
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, perfect.

40
00:02:05,078 --> 00:02:05,458
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

41
00:02:05,478 --> 00:02:08,199
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that seems good.

42
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,861
[SPEAKER_05]: So, what I proposed this evening is, first of all,

43
00:02:15,614 --> 00:02:26,660
[SPEAKER_05]: talk about the South Street District, talk about the website, have members introduce ourselves, and then I'll have answers.

44
00:02:29,181 --> 00:02:31,443
[SPEAKER_05]: Sound good?

45
00:02:31,923 --> 00:02:33,044
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

46
00:02:35,145 --> 00:02:40,528
[SPEAKER_05]: So the South Street Historic District is all set, with the exception of filing the

47
00:02:46,205 --> 00:02:48,327
[SPEAKER_05]: the map with the registrar of deeds.

48
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:56,513
[SPEAKER_05]: I should have done that before this meeting, but I didn't get around to it.

49
00:02:56,533 --> 00:03:01,996
[SPEAKER_05]: And I didn't know it would be anywhere near metrics or the registrar of deeds for that matter.

50
00:03:02,637 --> 00:03:11,684
[SPEAKER_05]: So either I can do that or a member can volunteer to take care of filing the map with the registrar of deeds.

51
00:03:15,567 --> 00:03:31,796
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as the website is concerned, the city has expressed interest in taking over the website from the third party that currently hosts it, but they have pretty much dropped the ball.

52
00:03:32,036 --> 00:03:37,799
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that fair, Teresa?

53
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:43,402
[SPEAKER_05]: They say they don't have the resources to actually

54
00:03:44,922 --> 00:03:53,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, they don't have the expertise to actually put a copy of the old website on our website.

55
00:03:55,789 --> 00:04:01,872
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is a problem, a problem that, uh, so, you know, I'm, I'm stepping down this evening.

56
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:10,037
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a problem that the new chair or whoever we, we designate as, as the, uh, um,

57
00:04:13,228 --> 00:04:17,310
[SPEAKER_05]: as the person to deal with website issues will have to deal with more.

58
00:04:18,451 --> 00:04:19,832
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's where that stands.

59
00:04:19,912 --> 00:04:32,140
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an important matter, and it is not a satisfactory proposal.

60
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:41,406
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, let's go around the room and introduce ourselves so we get to know each other a little bit.

61
00:04:42,962 --> 00:04:43,782
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm Chris Bader.

62
00:04:44,062 --> 00:04:45,883
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been on that commission for 23 years.

63
00:04:46,563 --> 00:04:48,783
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been chair for at least the past 10 years.

64
00:04:48,843 --> 00:04:50,343
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure when I became chair.

65
00:04:51,904 --> 00:04:57,485
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a retired artificial intelligence consultant, and I no longer live anywhere near Medford.

66
00:04:57,765 --> 00:05:03,986
[SPEAKER_05]: So, this is really exciting.

67
00:05:04,386 --> 00:05:05,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Joe, you wanna?

68
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:07,027
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Joe Rodane.

69
00:05:07,087 --> 00:05:09,047
[SPEAKER_02]: I live on Winter Street.

70
00:05:11,149 --> 00:05:12,670
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been on the board for two years.

71
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:19,055
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not really a general contractor, I'm a carpenter.

72
00:05:21,377 --> 00:05:26,921
[SPEAKER_02]: I work in the area and on all the homes and newer homes and that sort of thing.

73
00:05:28,262 --> 00:05:29,783
[SPEAKER_02]: Charlotte, do you want to introduce yourself?

74
00:05:30,504 --> 00:05:30,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

75
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Charlotte Scuderi.

76
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,928
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a realtor at Remax Andrew Realty.

77
00:05:36,508 --> 00:05:38,370
[SPEAKER_03]: I have been on the board for I think

78
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:41,929
[SPEAKER_03]: four, five years?

79
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:43,209
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all right?

80
00:05:43,549 --> 00:05:43,949
[SPEAKER_05]: At least.

81
00:05:45,049 --> 00:05:45,870
[SPEAKER_03]: At least, okay.

82
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:48,290
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's it.

83
00:05:50,511 --> 00:05:50,871
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

84
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:52,171
[SPEAKER_04]: James?

85
00:05:53,271 --> 00:05:54,512
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is James Mackey.

00:05:56,092 --> 00:06:01,213
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm an architect, and I have been on the board for 11 minutes.

88
00:06:01,574 --> 00:06:01,794
[SPEAKER_04]: Emery?

89
00:06:01,854 --> 00:06:02,794
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Emery McGowan.

90
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:10,849
[SPEAKER_01]: And I live on South Street, actually.

91
00:06:10,869 --> 00:06:13,330
[SPEAKER_01]: South Street, Chalk.

92
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:19,313
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he had one of the old shipbuilder's houses, luckily.

93
00:06:19,413 --> 00:06:21,895
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the most beautiful houses on South Street.

94
00:06:22,055 --> 00:06:22,855
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, really pretty.

95
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:24,796
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple of them, a couple of shipbuilders.

96
00:06:25,657 --> 00:06:29,339
[SPEAKER_01]: I live in the big purple one, so it's purple.

97
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:32,861
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I bought the house 27 years ago.

98
00:06:32,881 --> 00:06:37,323
[SPEAKER_01]: I moved from, I grew up in Medford and then moved to suburbs, did not like it.

99
00:06:37,936 --> 00:06:38,536
[SPEAKER_01]: came back.

100
00:06:39,456 --> 00:06:52,560
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I, when I am retired now, when I worked, I worked as an interior designer and I worked with real estate people doing renovations and, you know, foreign plans and whatever.

101
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,061
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, don't give me a house that's new.

102
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:56,921
[SPEAKER_01]: I want old, I want it virgin.

103
00:06:57,502 --> 00:06:58,382
[SPEAKER_01]: Boy, did I get it.

104
00:06:58,582 --> 00:07:01,423
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, it was vacant for like 10 years.

105
00:07:01,663 --> 00:07:03,783
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hauled away 15, 30 odd dumpsters and

106
00:07:06,806 --> 00:07:10,369
[SPEAKER_01]: kept everything that was good, you know, all the molding and all that.

107
00:07:10,589 --> 00:07:16,735
[SPEAKER_01]: So it looks still very much the period that it was built, 1830, well, 1834.

108
00:07:18,717 --> 00:07:28,866
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my story and that's why I'm interested in, you know, I'm interested in history and houses, obviously, and that's my story.

109
00:07:28,886 --> 00:07:29,707
[SPEAKER_05]: Terrific.

110
00:07:30,527 --> 00:07:33,270
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, Asita, can you introduce yourself?

111
00:07:34,073 --> 00:07:36,794
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, sorry, I think I lost my internet for a second.

112
00:07:37,295 --> 00:07:38,195
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Hasitha.

113
00:07:39,356 --> 00:07:40,176
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm an architect.

114
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:43,398
[SPEAKER_06]: I work with the architectural team at Chelsea.

115
00:07:44,078 --> 00:07:58,946
[SPEAKER_06]: I've done multiple redesigned restoration projects of historic buildings, and that was the main key for me to apply for the historic department and be a part of this community.

116
00:08:00,367 --> 00:08:03,188
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know what we are talking about right now.

117
00:08:03,228 --> 00:08:05,748
[SPEAKER_06]: I just missed my internet and then just joined back.

118
00:08:05,768 --> 00:08:10,429
[SPEAKER_06]: So a little introduction about me was that and I just had a baby boy.

119
00:08:10,549 --> 00:08:14,290
[SPEAKER_06]: So he's keeping me occupied and sorry, I was not able to be in person today.

120
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:16,031
[SPEAKER_06]: So no problem.

121
00:08:16,051 --> 00:08:17,351
[SPEAKER_05]: Congratulations.

122
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:18,271
[SPEAKER_05]: Congratulations.

123
00:08:18,351 --> 00:08:18,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

124
00:08:18,891 --> 00:08:19,311
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

125
00:08:20,151 --> 00:08:26,493
[SPEAKER_06]: I look forward to seeing you all in person and having some chat with you guys and understanding what our

126
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:33,255
[SPEAKER_06]: commission does for the community and be a valuable asset to you guys and the community.

127
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:34,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

128
00:08:35,276 --> 00:08:35,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

129
00:08:35,537 --> 00:08:36,678
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, welcome.

130
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:38,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you guys.

131
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so that's that.

132
00:08:41,942 --> 00:08:42,082
[SPEAKER_05]: So,

133
00:08:47,687 --> 00:09:12,374
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to elect a chair, a vice chair, and I would propose we elect a secretary, a secretary being the one who will deal with making sure that the minutes actually get posted, and that, and also, we have website issues that I mentioned, so the secretary

134
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:28,158
[SPEAKER_05]: probably could be the person designated to just make sure the website gets up and running, that either it continues with the existing provider or the city takes it over or whatever.

135
00:09:30,119 --> 00:09:33,221
[SPEAKER_05]: So, can I have a volunteer for chair?

136
00:09:34,982 --> 00:09:35,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Joe?

137
00:09:36,963 --> 00:09:37,844
[SPEAKER_05]: Anybody else?

138
00:09:41,326 --> 00:09:43,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, let's take a vote.

139
00:09:45,997 --> 00:09:55,482
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, can I have a second to, uh, can I have a second to, uh, uh, for, for Joe's nomination and Marie.

140
00:09:55,763 --> 00:09:56,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

141
00:09:56,923 --> 00:09:58,104
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'm nominate.

142
00:09:58,284 --> 00:09:59,465
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm seconding his.

143
00:09:59,525 --> 00:09:59,785
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

144
00:09:59,885 --> 00:10:01,165
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

145
00:10:01,205 --> 00:10:04,968
[SPEAKER_05]: So I technically I'm no longer a member of the commission, so I'm not going to vote.

146
00:10:05,868 --> 00:10:10,851
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, but let me, uh, let me call Charlotte for Joe.

147
00:10:11,531 --> 00:10:12,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I will.

148
00:10:12,772 --> 00:10:12,992
[SPEAKER_05]: Joe.

149
00:10:15,533 --> 00:10:15,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

150
00:10:16,473 --> 00:10:17,133
[SPEAKER_05]: Anne Marie?

151
00:10:17,253 --> 00:10:17,474
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

152
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:18,334
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

153
00:10:18,694 --> 00:10:19,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Asita?

154
00:10:20,714 --> 00:10:20,935
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_05]: Charlotte is our vice chair.

164
00:10:46,591 --> 00:10:48,112

179
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:25,359
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, Joe?

[SPEAKER_05]: You can vote for yourself.

[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's good.

189
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:37,604
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, now, do people think we need a secretary?

190
00:11:38,205 --> 00:11:40,386
[SPEAKER_05]: I do want someone to deal with the website issues.

191
00:11:41,346 --> 00:11:43,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Or we can just leave it to the chair and the vice chair.

192
00:11:43,727 --> 00:11:44,868
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm open to ideas.

193
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,071
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think, Joe?

194
00:11:48,331 --> 00:11:50,351
[SPEAKER_05]: If someone wants to be secretary, OK, then.

195
00:11:52,512 --> 00:11:54,932
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't look at me.

196
00:11:55,072 --> 00:11:57,033
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not that terrible.

197
00:11:57,313 --> 00:12:01,414
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, let's leave the office of secretary open.

198
00:12:02,634 --> 00:12:10,696
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe one of the people who isn't here can take care of it.

199
00:12:11,236 --> 00:12:12,876
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, that is pretty much it.

200
00:12:14,577 --> 00:12:15,337
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome, everybody.

201
00:12:15,905 --> 00:12:16,825
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we're in good hands.

202
00:12:18,386 --> 00:12:25,168
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the official part of the meeting is it, anybody have any other business?

203
00:12:28,409 --> 00:12:29,829
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, can I have a motion to adjourn?

204
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to adjourn, okay, second?

205
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,131
[SPEAKER_05]: I second.

206
00:12:36,271 --> 00:12:39,973
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so all in favor of adjourning, Charlotte?
