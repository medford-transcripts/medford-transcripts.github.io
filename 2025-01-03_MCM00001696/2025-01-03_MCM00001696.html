    <p>[Christopher Bader]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historic-district-commission-12-12-24&start=122.077">Okay,</a>  perfect. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historic-district-commission-12-12-24&start=125.078">Let's</a>  see. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historic-district-commission-12-12-24&start=125.478">Yeah,</a>  that seems good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historic-district-commission-12-12-24&start=131.64">So,</a>  what I proposed this evening is, first of all, <a href="https://archive.org/details/historic-district-commission-12-12-24&start=135.614">talk</a>  about the South Street District, talk about the website, have members introduce ourselves, and then I'll have answers. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historic-district-commission-12-12-24&start=149.181">Sound</a>  good? <a href="https://archive.org/details/historic-district-commission-12-12-24&start=151.923">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historic-district-commission-12-12-24&start=155.145">So</a>  the South Street Historic District is all set, with the exception of filing the <a href="https://archive.org/details/historic-district-commission-12-12-24&start=166.205">the</a>  map with the registrar of deeds. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historic-district-commission-12-12-24&start=172.49">I</a>  should have done that before this meeting, but I didn't get around to it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historic-district-commission-12-12-24&start=176.533">And</a>  I didn't know it would be anywhere near metrics or the registrar of deeds for that matter. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historic-district-commission-12-12-24&start=182.637">So</a>  either I can do that or a member can volunteer to take care of filing the map with the registrar of deeds. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historic-district-commission-12-12-24&start=195.567">As</a>  far as the website is concerned, the city has expressed interest in taking over the website from the third party that currently hosts it, but they have pretty much dropped the ball. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historic-district-commission-12-12-24&start=212.036">Is</a>  that fair, Teresa? <a href="https://archive.org/details/historic-district-commission-12-12-24&start=219.34">They</a>  say they don't have the resources to actually <a href="https://archive.org/details/historic-district-commission-12-12-24&start=224.922">Um,</a>  they don't have the expertise to actually put a copy of the old website on our website. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historic-district-commission-12-12-24&start=235.789">So</a>  this is a problem, a problem that, uh, so, you know, I'm, I'm stepping down this evening. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historic-district-commission-12-12-24&start=242.492">This</a>  is a problem that the new chair or whoever we, we designate as, as the, uh, um, <a href="https://archive.org/details/historic-district-commission-12-12-24&start=253.228">as</a>  the person to deal with website issues will have to deal with more. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historic-district-commission-12-12-24&start=258.451">So</a>  that's where that stands. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historic-district-commission-12-12-24&start=259.912">It's</a>  an important matter, and it is not a satisfactory proposal. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historic-district-commission-12-12-24&start=272.46">And</a>  so, let's go around the room and introduce ourselves so we get to know each other a little bit. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historic-district-commission-12-12-24&start=282.962">I'm</a>  Chris Bader. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historic-district-commission-12-12-24&start=284.062">I've</a>  been on that commission for 23 years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historic-district-commission-12-12-24&start=286.563">I've</a>  been chair for at least the past 10 years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historic-district-commission-12-12-24&start=288.843">I'm</a>  not sure when I became chair. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historic-district-commission-12-12-24&start=291.904">I'm</a>  a retired artificial intelligence consultant, and I no longer live anywhere near Medford. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historic-district-commission-12-12-24&start=297.765">So,</a>  this is really exciting.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/historic-district-commission-12-12-24&start=304.386">Joe,</a>  you wanna? <a href="https://archive.org/details/historic-district-commission-12-12-24&start=306.106">I'm</a>  Joe Rodane. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historic-district-commission-12-12-24&start=307.087">I</a>  live on Winter Street. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historic-district-commission-12-12-24&start=311.149">I've</a>  been on the board for two years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historic-district-commission-12-12-24&start=312.69">I'm</a>  not really a general contractor, I'm a carpenter. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historic-district-commission-12-12-24&start=321.377">I</a>  work in the area and on all the homes and newer homes and that sort of thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/historic-district-commission-12-12-24&start=328.262">Charlotte,</a>  do you want to introduce yourself?</p>
