1
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,080
Hey listeners, this is Danielle.

2
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:11,961
And Shelley.

3
00:00:12,701 --> 00:00:15,342
Shelley is a radical Dravidian and racial equity activist.

4
00:00:15,642 --> 00:00:18,382
And Danielle is a community mobilizer and change maker.

5
00:00:19,023 --> 00:00:20,723
And this is the Medford Bites podcast.

6
00:00:22,003 --> 00:00:28,905
Every two weeks, we chew on the issues facing Medford and deliver bites of information about the city by lifting the expertise of our guests.

7
00:00:29,745 --> 00:00:32,786
Join us in discussion about what you hope for the future of Medford.

8
00:00:33,206 --> 00:00:35,287
And as always, tell us where you like to eat.

9
00:00:41,195 --> 00:00:43,398
All right, thanks so much for being with me tonight.

10
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:48,085
If you don't mind just introducing yourself with your name, pronouns, and who you are.

11
00:00:48,906 --> 00:00:49,247
Sure.

12
00:00:49,387 --> 00:00:50,308
I'm Erica Reinfeldt.

13
00:00:50,328 --> 00:00:51,370
My pronouns are she, her.

14
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:55,997
I am a first term school committee incumbent running for re-election.

15
00:00:57,004 --> 00:00:57,905
All right, thanks, Erica.

16
00:00:57,965 --> 00:00:59,707
So we're going to talk a little bit more about that soon.

17
00:00:59,747 --> 00:01:08,155
But before we get into that, if you could just answer the question that I ask everyone on the podcast, which you have answered before, but it was some time ago now.

18
00:01:08,836 --> 00:01:11,078
But what is your favorite place to eat in Medford?

19
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:12,139
And what do you like to eat there?

20
00:01:14,813 --> 00:01:19,617
All right, you know, I think I said Goldilocks last time and it really just makes a weekend complete.

21
00:01:20,558 --> 00:01:28,524
And I like to mix it up, but the Nova Locks is probably my favorite because I am a sucker for a good smoked salmon and schmear.

22
00:01:29,044 --> 00:01:34,949
Yeah, and I feel like it's a reliable weekend breakfast treat.

23
00:01:35,049 --> 00:01:41,454
And they're actually donating their Love Locks to the agency that I work for, the Boston Area Crisis Center, this weekend.

24
00:01:42,595 --> 00:01:44,697
By breakfast, I have to go in.

25
00:01:44,997 --> 00:01:47,238
Yeah, same.

26
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:50,601
OK, so you mentioned you are like an incumbent.

27
00:01:50,621 --> 00:01:54,624
So you this year kind of wrapping up your first term on the school committee.

28
00:01:54,644 --> 00:02:02,869
I'm wondering if you can kind of reflect on what that's been like, some of the things that in the last time we talked, you were preparing for that term.

29
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:05,651
Now you've been an active school committee member.

30
00:02:06,152 --> 00:02:07,593
What are some of the takeaways?

31
00:02:07,633 --> 00:02:08,674
What are you proud of?

32
00:02:08,754 --> 00:02:11,856
What have you kind of accomplished in your time so far?

33
00:02:12,762 --> 00:02:16,846
Yeah, well, like anything having to do with schools, there's been a lot of learning.

34
00:02:16,866 --> 00:02:28,676
So understanding and getting to know the system and how things work and when things don't work and really building relationships with folks in the district.

35
00:02:28,696 --> 00:02:34,562
It's been amazing actually getting to know so many more families, more educators, more administrators.

36
00:02:35,202 --> 00:02:40,968
to really understand what everyone's unique talents are and try to find ways to bring them together.

37
00:02:41,288 --> 00:02:46,273
And then of course, the people that I serve on the school committee with figuring out how to how to work as a team.

38
00:02:46,293 --> 00:02:48,215
And I think one of the biggest things.

39
00:02:49,445 --> 00:02:58,809
I learned, well, I came into it about two years ago and I thought, all right, I know there are always gonna be two sides to a story and let's not jump to conclusions about anything.

40
00:02:59,229 --> 00:03:03,190
But I think the thing I learned is that there are pretty much always more than two sides to the story.

41
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,171
So there's always more to learn there.

42
00:03:05,191 --> 00:03:11,953
Yeah, so, and you asked about what I'm really proud of.

43
00:03:11,973 --> 00:03:18,056
And I think I've done a lot to listen to people and then bring those,

44
00:03:19,287 --> 00:03:32,430
ideas, those needs into action and create policies or mechanisms or systems for really making change and making progress on things that maybe the district hadn't been doing for a while.

45
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:43,132
So things like, actually, you and I both have kids at the Roberts and we've seen how crowded it can be and how many more classes there are per grade.

46
00:03:44,092 --> 00:03:48,533
And so I brought a resolution to the floor that said, it's time to talk about

47
00:03:49,513 --> 00:04:04,064
How we distribute students across the elementary school, and now we're doing space assessments and figuring out what are the solutions we made some short term changes to reduce the burden on the building for this school year, but really looking at long term action.

48
00:04:05,065 --> 00:04:06,185
Another example.

49
00:04:07,471 --> 00:04:09,392
After school always a hot topic.

50
00:04:10,052 --> 00:04:11,893
It actually was never my hot topic.

51
00:04:11,973 --> 00:04:13,573
It was not why I was doing this.

52
00:04:14,134 --> 00:04:22,137
I knew it was important to people, but it hadn't directly affected my family, but I heard from so many people that this was this was the thing they needed most to feel.

53
00:04:24,016 --> 00:04:25,237
part of Medford schools.

54
00:04:25,497 --> 00:04:34,081
And so I worked with a lot of caregivers to create this afterschool task force that is now making progress.

55
00:04:34,101 --> 00:04:41,125
They just had another meeting on Tuesday where they're working with a consultant and really thinking about what can we do.

56
00:04:41,185 --> 00:04:44,066
They've made progress for this year to open up more spots.

57
00:04:45,167 --> 00:04:45,327
But

58
00:04:46,267 --> 00:04:50,753
All kinds of things that I think people have been talking about and saying, oh, we should do that someday.

59
00:04:50,773 --> 00:04:52,615
I think we're really starting to do it.

60
00:04:52,635 --> 00:04:55,419
I'm really proud of the work on the overrides, right?

61
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:58,663
We had a really bad budget cycle, my very first budget cycle.

62
00:04:59,878 --> 00:05:15,813
It was rough, but to be able to take that and say, we're going to invest in our city and really I created a lot of the educational materials for the public to explain what this meant and what we were going to do and what we could do and why it was happening the way it was.

63
00:05:16,614 --> 00:05:19,395
And I think that helped bring the community on board.

64
00:05:19,435 --> 00:05:22,577
It was a close vote, but it's really exciting what we did.

65
00:05:22,637 --> 00:05:24,698
And now we've changed the schedules.

66
00:05:24,878 --> 00:05:26,958
There are a lot more options for people in high school.

67
00:05:26,998 --> 00:05:29,179
We've added the challenge classes in the middle school.

68
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,861
We've created contracts that are much more flexible and respectful.

69
00:05:36,686 --> 00:05:38,328
really putting the students first.

70
00:05:38,488 --> 00:05:39,830
So I'm really proud of that work.

71
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:43,194
And I'm a little bit proud of the social media.

72
00:05:43,214 --> 00:05:51,764
I never thought I was going to be proud of being on social media, but I do regular meeting recaps after every meeting.

73
00:05:51,804 --> 00:05:51,884
And

74
00:05:54,066 --> 00:06:15,064
it's been nice to kind of look all together at what's happening in our meetings but also seeing how people are engaging with that and asking questions and trying to understand what school committee does because it was one of those things two years ago I had I'd met with most of the people who served on school committee and in recent years and I had a sense of sense of what it was but

75
00:06:16,065 --> 00:06:27,471
I think we're really making it more clear what the school committee can do, what the superintendent can do, what families can do, what the people on the ground with the kids can do, bringing voices in.

76
00:06:29,492 --> 00:06:36,075
So it's been really exciting to learn all that and to see it change the student experience in good ways.

77
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:47,378
Thank you, and I actually had noticed that the Roberts, like my son's in fourth grade and the other one's in kindergarten, but the class sizes do seem smaller, like, which I'm not, I was like surprised.

78
00:06:47,418 --> 00:06:54,843
He has like maybe 16 kids in his class, which seems a lot different from previous years, but those are a lot of things that you named, right?

79
00:06:54,883 --> 00:06:59,927
Like the, like, you know, kind of helping to chip away at some of the afterschool issues.

80
00:07:00,227 --> 00:07:03,489
The override is like a huge thing, adding to the school day.

81
00:07:03,509 --> 00:07:04,951
Like, I think that's like actually like,

82
00:07:05,711 --> 00:07:12,916
A lot of change to happen in just two years and I imagine there was some amount of time that you spent just kind of learning the job like you said.

83
00:07:13,696 --> 00:07:17,459
So, to be able to get that much done in that amount of time is really impressive.

84
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:20,341
One of the things that I actually I'm glad that you mentioned it.

85
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:32,029
Was, you know, some of the things that I've been hearing is like, there's there's all these ideas that people have about what the school committee can do and and and that, like, a lot of what those ideas are actually aren't accurate.

86
00:07:32,069 --> 00:07:35,511
Like, there's like, that this, this, this whole committee has a pretty.

87
00:07:36,772 --> 00:07:40,235
Um, not like narrow, but, like, they have a scope that they are focused on.

88
00:07:40,275 --> 00:07:45,480
And that is maybe more limited than, like, the general public knows about.

89
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:51,625
So, yeah, I wonder what you, like, if you could share kind of what surprised you about that, like, or what you've learned in that way.

90
00:07:52,686 --> 00:07:57,830
Yeah, so the school committee, kind of the big things that they're responsible for approving the budget.

91
00:07:58,815 --> 00:08:02,216
hiring and evaluating the superintendent and writing policy.

92
00:08:02,477 --> 00:08:26,107
And it really is up to the people working in the schools under the direction of the superintendent to execute on those policies and to make sure what's happening in classrooms, in hallways, in extracurriculars, in the broader school community are aligned with those policies and are beneficial for students and are really, they're the ones who are focused on what happens in the classroom.

93
00:08:27,127 --> 00:08:32,743
We do on school committee get a fair number of emails from people saying this thing happened in the school.

94
00:08:35,487 --> 00:08:54,995
It's funny because our official role doesn't necessarily cover that but we really are the liaison between administration and the voters, the people who are in our community and experiencing things and some of that is recommending pathways for them to explore and they don't know who to talk to.

95
00:08:55,075 --> 00:08:56,436
I think that's been a real issue.

96
00:08:57,376 --> 00:09:03,926
in Medford schools is not knowing what the chain of command or, more importantly, the chain of communication is.

97
00:09:03,947 --> 00:09:09,856
So I think we can do a lot to make that visible and facilitate it.

98
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,999
One of the things that I always like doing is

99
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:21,084
Figuring out what are the resources and the talents that are in the community or in the district and how do we bring those together.

100
00:09:21,104 --> 00:09:28,107
You know I had I got an email earlier this week about some things that had happened in the schools that were a pattern.

101
00:09:28,967 --> 00:09:32,910
that were making some families feel very unwelcome.

102
00:09:33,471 --> 00:09:35,112
And so I was able to hop on a call.

103
00:09:35,192 --> 00:09:40,257
So I was able to address some of that with administrators who had the power to change it.

104
00:09:40,737 --> 00:09:43,420
But then when I hopped on a call to talk about it with the families,

105
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:56,143
we had a much bigger, better conversation about it was these actions and it was these patterns, but here are the things that I would like to see that didn't necessarily make it into that email.

106
00:09:56,643 --> 00:09:59,864
And so I think the conversations are really important.

107
00:10:00,884 --> 00:10:09,867
Nothing in the school committee job description says go out for coffee with people and find out what's working and not working, but you need to do that in order to do the job.

108
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:14,106
Oh, yeah, no, that's that's really helpful to hear.

109
00:10:14,126 --> 00:10:21,053
OK, so after, you know, these last two years, you've done a lot of work.

110
00:10:21,113 --> 00:10:22,654
And I just say, like, I think that the.

111
00:10:24,038 --> 00:10:34,061
focus on the budget for schools and talking about the override was like, I think a really motivating factor for a lot of people.

112
00:10:34,121 --> 00:10:37,622
I think that's something that means a lot to people in Medford.

113
00:10:38,902 --> 00:10:50,305
Yeah, but I'm gonna jump in and say, we have a huge responsibility now to spend those funds wisely and make sure people know where that money is going and how it's benefiting students.

114
00:10:50,345 --> 00:10:51,386
I don't take any of it for granted.

115
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:53,366
Thank you.

116
00:10:53,406 --> 00:10:53,947
Yeah, thank you.

117
00:10:54,347 --> 00:10:54,627
Yeah.

118
00:10:55,228 --> 00:10:55,949
Um, okay.

119
00:10:55,969 --> 00:11:10,401
So, and then it sounds like, you know, we're kind of thinking about forward to maybe how to fund a new high school but before we get to that I want to hear like kind of what your hopes are for a second term like what your goal or your priorities would be.

120
00:11:12,943 --> 00:11:37,429
Yeah, so I think on one level, a huge priority is making sure all of this work that we've started continues and that there's follow through and that people are following up on the promise, whether it's the overrides funds of the partnership with City Year, whether it's new leadership, hiring people, bringing in new curricula, changes to schedules, and just making sure all of those things are delivering.

121
00:11:37,469 --> 00:11:41,290
So that's a huge priority, the consistency and making sure things happen.

122
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:55,498
I'm also really concerned about what's happening at the federal level in terms of education so I think it's really important that we have local leaders who are going to stand up and protect

123
00:11:56,968 --> 00:12:08,395
particularly our most vulnerable students, but really all students and make sure they're getting a good education and they're getting the tools and the skills and the knowledge that they need to thrive in the world.

124
00:12:08,455 --> 00:12:18,700
And also the thing that I would really like to see is to have conversations, because I think we got to where we are by being at each other's throats or against each other.

125
00:12:19,301 --> 00:12:20,521
And so I would love to see

126
00:12:21,702 --> 00:12:28,865
more conversation and really helping people have difficult conversations, because a lot of the challenges that we're facing are not easy.

127
00:12:29,985 --> 00:12:31,546
So those are my big things.

128
00:12:31,586 --> 00:12:46,292
And then if I get to have a personal goal, I would really like to enhance our academic offerings and make sure that students can all across the range of learning styles, learning speeds,

129
00:12:47,721 --> 00:12:51,985
whether they need extra support or extra challenge and make sure they're getting those things.

130
00:12:52,486 --> 00:12:56,190
So that's what I'm kind of personally passionate about.

131
00:12:56,290 --> 00:13:01,135
But I think there are going to be a lot of factors that influence what we're able to do.

132
00:13:01,755 --> 00:13:08,042
And I think being really aware of that and understanding the context in which learning is happening.

133
00:13:10,502 --> 00:13:14,084
Yeah, there's certainly like a scary landscape right now, right?

134
00:13:14,124 --> 00:13:24,591
Like what and a lot of stuff that we know isn't going to change and a lot of stuff that we don't know how it's going to change and like, well, and I think that not knowing is really important.

135
00:13:24,611 --> 00:13:32,536
I think that whether or not things change, the embedded uncertainty is destabilizing in and of itself.

136
00:13:33,056 --> 00:13:39,120
And so to be able to be confident that we have strong budgets, flexible budgets, a

137
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:46,224
strong community that will support each other and that will recognize what people need and be able to bring that together in creative ways.

138
00:13:46,244 --> 00:14:03,275
I think that's so essential regardless of what happens at the federal level or the state level, just being ready and supportive of each other and recognizing that sometimes not knowing is even scarier than anything that comes out of that.

139
00:14:04,676 --> 00:14:10,060
Yeah, and how do you see your role in the school committee as aiding in that process?

140
00:14:11,702 --> 00:14:24,433
I think a lot of it is about making visible what's happening, because there are people doing really good work that we don't see, and there are people who could use some guidance to get on better paths, certainly.

141
00:14:24,733 --> 00:14:26,254
Nobody there is perfect.

142
00:14:28,335 --> 00:14:51,225
So I think the transparency there, I think facilitating those conversations, making sure any policies that are coming to the floor are really grounded in a community approach, not just what I think needs to happen, not just what this group of seven people thinks needs to happen, but that is really understanding the multiple perspectives.

143
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:54,527
And so I think bringing people into the room, making sure

144
00:14:55,721 --> 00:15:01,305
all the voices that need to be there are there, and that we're asking good questions.

145
00:15:01,365 --> 00:15:08,589
We're not taking things at face value, but just being really rigorous in how we set up the system to make change.

146
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:11,871
And I think strong and flexible keeps coming back.

147
00:15:13,777 --> 00:15:27,553
And so, in terms of, like, unknown change to specific to the school committee, we have an interim superintendent right now and there's a plan search or application process.

148
00:15:27,573 --> 00:15:28,595
However, however you want to word it.

149
00:15:29,582 --> 00:15:34,246
How do you see that as part of, I don't know, the future?

150
00:15:34,346 --> 00:15:42,151
Or what are you looking for when you think about continued stability for that committee?

151
00:15:42,231 --> 00:15:50,097
So I think it's worth noting that the school committee has full discretion on what happens in the appointment of a superintendent.

152
00:15:50,217 --> 00:15:50,958
It can be a search.

153
00:15:50,998 --> 00:15:52,379
It doesn't have to be a search.

154
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:54,760
The Massachusetts Association of School Committees

155
00:15:55,721 --> 00:16:02,150
is very adamant that if you have someone that's working well in the district, you hold on to them.

156
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:02,210
So

157
00:16:05,678 --> 00:16:13,321
What I'm really conscious of though is the fact that the current interim superintendent was appointed very quickly with very little community input.

158
00:16:14,281 --> 00:16:26,065
So I would really like to see the community weigh in on the new strategic planning process that we just kicked off that is both about the direction of the district, but also the leadership needed for that.

159
00:16:26,965 --> 00:16:28,626
So that's gonna be in our meeting just

160
00:16:30,386 --> 00:16:40,653
Last earlier this week, we presented that to the committee and they approved to move forward with that and we've got to balance it with all the community input needed around the new high school.

161
00:16:41,053 --> 00:16:46,977
So there's a lot of balancing, but in terms of that long term planning, I think.

162
00:16:48,338 --> 00:17:12,182
knowing that the community has articulated clear and specific goals for what things need to be like from an educational perspective, from an operations perspective, from a community perspective, really looking at people who have the skills to make that happen and who can empower a community of educators and administrators to make that happen.

163
00:17:12,622 --> 00:17:14,483
So I think it's a really important conversation.

164
00:17:15,563 --> 00:17:40,164
i don't feel like i've heard from everyone in the community yet and that's really what i want to do before this decision happens of what what the search or hiring process looks like interesting i didn't know that you could that you guys had the power to choose whether there is a search or not but it sounds like there could be some kind of middle ground of like assessing people's feelings about dr glucy and whether

165
00:17:40,883 --> 00:17:44,264
know, whether people think she's doing a good job and want to keep her or whatever.

166
00:17:44,304 --> 00:17:44,444
Yeah.

167
00:17:44,824 --> 00:17:48,705
And I'm going to admit every time I talk to people and this comes up, I say to them, what do you think?

168
00:17:48,785 --> 00:17:50,705
What's, what's going on?

169
00:17:50,825 --> 00:18:01,268
You know, I had, I had a meeting today with an administrator who said, I've worked under eight different superintendents and she's the best one that I've ever worked with.

170
00:18:01,368 --> 00:18:02,788
And that means something.

171
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:10,570
And I had a one of actually one of my child's teachers said, you know, this was the first time I felt listened to when I raised a problem, like

172
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:17,191
the concern she had over something that happened at the district level that filtered down into the classroom.

173
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:21,892
And I have people who say, all right, I'd like more support in this area.

174
00:18:22,072 --> 00:18:29,293
And so then it becomes a question of, is that, can Dr. Galussi and her team provide that support?

175
00:18:30,894 --> 00:18:36,555
What else is available to make things work for people?

176
00:18:38,655 --> 00:18:38,755
So.

177
00:18:39,558 --> 00:18:39,878
Yeah.

178
00:18:40,818 --> 00:18:44,659
The superintendent evaluation process is very awkward.

179
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:52,082
I sat in on some of the evaluations for Dr. Edward Vincent before I was on the school committee, and it's awkward.

180
00:18:52,122 --> 00:18:56,163
It's one of the only times people have a performance review in public.

181
00:18:56,683 --> 00:18:56,923
Yeah.

182
00:18:57,503 --> 00:19:11,432
So I think it's really important that we understand the context for those comments and hear from the people who maybe aren't going to say something out loud, but use all of that to inform the decision making.

183
00:19:11,452 --> 00:19:12,493
It's a big decision.

184
00:19:13,629 --> 00:19:14,550
Yeah, it is.

185
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:24,057
And yeah, I mean, I can say that like even before even before she was a superintendent, I had had to like, you know, email her about school stuff.

186
00:19:24,097 --> 00:19:34,065
And she got back to me, like, which is, you know, I think it's it shouldn't be this way, but it is surprising, like when when like, you know, you've never had a face to face with someone and they are like in touch with you.

187
00:19:34,145 --> 00:19:35,626
And she was on the podcast.

188
00:19:35,646 --> 00:19:39,409
She was very easy to like get to, you know, cooperate for those things.

189
00:19:39,449 --> 00:19:42,471
So that I think that's and I think that's a

190
00:19:44,001 --> 00:19:49,605
quality and a superintendent that's really important like that sort of accessibility function.

191
00:19:50,686 --> 00:19:58,611
I think one of the other things that I noticed I noticed this when she was in the assistant superintendent role is that she knows

192
00:20:00,012 --> 00:20:05,797
where her strengths are and where she needs to grow and learn, and she's really actively trying to do that.

193
00:20:05,857 --> 00:20:20,949
So she, in our last school committee meeting, she presented her transition slash entry report, the results of all the listening sessions and the work that they've been doing in instructional teams and creating consistency and coherence across the district.

194
00:20:21,009 --> 00:20:24,792
And there have been a lot of things happening that I think not everyone sees.

195
00:20:25,532 --> 00:20:33,897
Because it's, it's so much and the operation side and the learning side and what are we doing with all this data that we're getting because we get a lot of data.

196
00:20:33,917 --> 00:20:46,085
And, you know, my big question there is what are we doing to empower educators to use that data strategically, we could have a whole conversation about testing and MCAS and map testing and all the things we do and.

197
00:20:48,037 --> 00:20:51,118
I work in museum evaluation, right?

198
00:20:51,258 --> 00:20:52,998
And so I'm a big fan.

199
00:20:53,018 --> 00:21:01,101
If you're not gonna use the data, don't collect it, but if you've got it, what does it tell us and what does it, how does it inform our action, right?

200
00:21:01,141 --> 00:21:04,122
We can reflect on what's happened, but we can't dwell on it.

201
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:05,342
We've got to move forward.

202
00:21:06,642 --> 00:21:09,423
And I think the data people in these committees are so important, right?

203
00:21:09,463 --> 00:21:15,505
Like, cause there's like only so many people that know how to like make sense of that and go through what I find to be

204
00:21:16,533 --> 00:21:21,297
mind numbing, but I'm glad that you find it interesting and that you can appreciate it's important.

205
00:21:21,357 --> 00:21:23,078
I'm a qualitative data person.

206
00:21:23,098 --> 00:21:43,034
That's, I appreciate quantitative data and I like to think I can navigate it with some dexterity, but qualitative data is really my bread and butter as an educator and a program evaluator, because I think those stories and really the themes and the patterns, I'm always looking for themes and patterns.

207
00:21:45,061 --> 00:21:55,670
that's what is going to help us really understand how change is working or not, or whether it's needed or not.

208
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:58,512
And I think, well, you brought up like sort of standardized test too.

209
00:21:58,532 --> 00:22:02,896
And I think that the balance to that is that like qualitative data, right?

210
00:22:02,976 --> 00:22:08,740
It's like, this is what we see on paper, but this is the lived experience of everybody and how we've arrived at these data points, right?

211
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:11,903
And I think that's a really valuable thing, especially in education.

212
00:22:12,437 --> 00:22:25,894
Yeah, and I think that you know there's a place for quantitative data data as well, because those have different trends and patterns and we need we do need assessments that are kind of normed across the state across the federal level to understand.

213
00:22:27,336 --> 00:22:42,832
How is it, how are things working for other people, how are things working for us, what are some people doing differently, what resources does this community have that we don't have, what strategies are they using, what are we doing really well, and how do we apply that to other areas.

214
00:22:42,872 --> 00:22:47,297
So I think it's really important that we have good high quality assessment.

215
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,157
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

216
00:22:50,818 --> 00:22:53,580
Okay, well, this is really, really helpful to hear.

217
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:58,925
Is there anything else that we haven't talked about that you think is important for me, for us to know about your campaign?

218
00:23:00,847 --> 00:23:01,748
It's a good question.

219
00:23:01,768 --> 00:23:10,276
I'm trying to think about all the things that I've been talking to people about at the doors.

220
00:23:10,296 --> 00:23:10,736
I think

221
00:23:13,127 --> 00:23:24,376
One of the things that has been a theme that maybe I'd like to call out a little more is the work that I've done really trying to affirm the values that we have as a community.

222
00:23:24,396 --> 00:23:35,084
And some of that is in resolutions and some of that is in bringing people together in conversation and to understand what it really means to support all students.

223
00:23:36,025 --> 00:23:37,886
So that's really important to me.

224
00:23:37,906 --> 00:23:50,890
I talked about enhancing our academic offerings and what's happening in the classroom, but also making sure people feel like they belong in Medford schools and there's a place for them and that they have a voice in shaping what happens next for Medford schools.

225
00:23:53,011 --> 00:24:03,955
We are really at this critical point right now in what our district looks like, what our district is going to do, how it's going to respond to a very quickly changing world.

226
00:24:06,886 --> 00:24:12,793
I'm really excited to be a part of realizing those visions and making sure that everyone's voice is part of them.

227
00:24:13,834 --> 00:24:15,396
Yeah, thank you for that.

228
00:24:15,436 --> 00:24:21,023
Yeah, and I think it's an evolving thing and it's helpful to have people that are always paying attention to that.

229
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:22,685
Well, thank you.

230
00:24:23,957 --> 00:24:26,698
Yeah, thanks for having me, especially so close to the election.

231
00:24:27,958 --> 00:24:32,359
It's such a busy time, but I really appreciate the opportunity to sit down and chat.

232
00:24:32,419 --> 00:24:36,799
And I guess to anyone listening, I'd say, let's keep chatting.

233
00:24:36,939 --> 00:24:38,800
I'd love to hear your perspectives as well.

234
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:39,560
Yeah.

235
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:40,000
Thank you.

236
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:40,100
Yeah.

237
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:45,721
And what people don't know is how late it is that we're meeting and how, you know, how much of a scramble everyone's schedules are these days.

238
00:24:45,741 --> 00:24:49,122
So thank you for making time for the podcast and good luck in the election.

239
00:24:49,642 --> 00:24:50,422
Thank you so much.

240
