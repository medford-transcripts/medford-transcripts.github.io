1
00:02:19,226 --> 00:02:19,726
Would you let me.

2
00:02:19,746 --> 00:02:19,847
Yes.

3
00:02:19,867 --> 00:02:20,027
Yes.

4
00:02:54,244 --> 00:02:57,745
There will be a meeting of the Planning and Permanent Committee on September 25, 2024.

5
00:02:58,185 --> 00:03:00,746
This meeting will take place at 6 p.m.

6
00:03:00,766 --> 00:03:05,487
in the City Council Chamber, second floor, Medford City Hall, and via Zoom.

7
00:03:05,627 --> 00:03:06,727
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

8
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:08,247
Present.

9
00:03:08,287 --> 00:03:08,548
Present.

10
00:03:08,608 --> 00:03:08,948
Present.

11
00:03:09,128 --> 00:03:09,808
Present.

12
00:03:09,908 --> 00:03:10,148
Present.

13
00:03:23,949 --> 00:03:27,310
It's not him, so he's... Great, thank you.

14
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:28,490
Four present, one absent.

15
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:29,531
This meeting is called to order.

16
00:03:30,771 --> 00:03:41,234
The action discussion item for this meeting is, again, paper 24033, Zoning Ordinance Updates with the NS Associates Team.

17
00:03:41,614 --> 00:03:49,917
At this meeting, we will be discussing a proposal for zoning along Mystic Avenue Corridor.

18
00:03:50,595 --> 00:03:56,437
which has been robustly discussed by this committee in various planning stages over the past several months.

19
00:03:57,498 --> 00:04:05,861
So tonight we're looking at a set of documents that are more baked than they have been over the past few weeks of workshopping this in committee with our zoning consultant, NS Associates.

20
00:04:08,622 --> 00:04:13,523
Before we get started, I just want to set the table for this meeting.

21
00:04:14,864 --> 00:04:16,565
We're getting a bit of a late start.

22
00:04:16,665 --> 00:04:17,685
I apologize for that.

23
00:04:17,845 --> 00:04:20,366
Had some delay getting everybody here and online.

24
00:04:21,609 --> 00:04:27,234
We are just gonna I think we should try to keep this to about if we can try and wrap by 8 p.m.

25
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:28,235
I think that would be great.

26
00:04:28,275 --> 00:04:44,809
I think that that's we have plenty to Discuss but I think that we have some clear decision points this evening So I'm really confident that we can get through this in an hour and a half maybe even earlier because counselors have had all weekend to review the documents that we're looking at before us tonight with some only some minor changes and

27
00:04:45,918 --> 00:05:02,508
I also want to note that it is our norm to have public participation at the end of committee meetings, so stick with us and we'll be sure to hear from everybody, whether you're here in the chambers with us or on Zoom, after the discussion between counselors, staff, and the zoning consultant.

28
00:05:04,069 --> 00:05:10,973
Before I hand it over to Paola from Innis Associates to give us a presentation of what we're looking at tonight, I just want to say that

29
00:05:12,628 --> 00:05:19,151
Over the past several meetings the discussion of mystic corridor has been really central what we've talked about in this committee.

30
00:05:19,171 --> 00:05:32,457
We're kind of in a way splitting our work in rezoning between these kind of quarter by quarter approaches and global strategies for the whole city mystic has been a priority from the Council from the community.

31
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:57,340
from staff, we know that we need to really make tracks to rezone this so that we get what we want on Mystic and not just what happens to be there by right now, that developers can utilize or take advantage of that might not reflect what residents currently want to see on Mystic and from Mystic and may not be giving the community all the benefits that we deserve and that we need.

32
00:06:00,074 --> 00:06:23,159
So I think that our main decision points that Paola is going to speak to are around doling up the land use for various parts of Mystic, particularly on the west side, where we have kind of a menu of options for how to deal with the zoning on the west side of Mystic, proposed included parcels, a question of setbacks.

33
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:28,140
But beyond that, the documents that we're about to look at are the product of these many meetings of talking about

34
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,421
What do we know that we want from Mystic Ave?

35
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:36,324
What do our many studies and plans and community sessions over the past several years tell us that the community wants from Mystic Ave?

36
00:06:37,084 --> 00:06:40,946
So all of that feeds into the documents and the questions that we're looking at tonight.

37
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:57,255
And, you know, from the chair, I'll say that my goal is for the end of the meeting tonight for us to be able to make some motions to give Innis Associates some really clear marching orders for how we wanna go forward so that two committee meetings from now on October 23rd,

38
00:06:58,433 --> 00:07:04,637
we can see a finalized proposal of this corridor zoning back and report it out of committee.

39
00:07:04,697 --> 00:07:14,684
But we'll have to make, we'll have to have a discussion tonight around those main decision points so that by the end of the evening, we can say, all right, this, this and that, we're gonna say yes on this, no on that.

40
00:07:15,025 --> 00:07:16,466
Here's what we want, please package it up.

41
00:07:16,926 --> 00:07:17,947
Let's look at it one more time.

42
00:07:20,228 --> 00:07:24,031
And let's get this moving onto the Community Development Board and the procedural steps after that.

43
00:07:25,372 --> 00:07:27,093
All right, with that table set,

44
00:07:28,826 --> 00:07:29,066
One minute?

45
00:07:30,027 --> 00:07:32,068
Oh yeah, I'd be happy to turn it over to Director Hunt.

46
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:42,734
Madam Chair, we're gonna have the zoning consultant do most of this, but I just wanted to mention, particularly for the public, that we have set up a webpage.

47
00:07:43,274 --> 00:07:57,942
So if you go to medfordma.org slash zoning, we now have a lot of information about what's been going on with zoning, including information about the MBTA zoning, changes that were made over the winter and last year,

48
00:07:58,602 --> 00:08:10,412
And then residents can follow along with this process that we've been doing, including links to all the videos from the meetings we've been having and various documents.

49
00:08:11,253 --> 00:08:19,040
And they can continue to follow along with what we're doing now with the documents being presented tonight even.

50
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:47,381
We'll try and get the PowerPoints up there sometimes in advance of the meeting sometimes right after the meeting depending on our timing But the materials that get provided to the counselors will go up there Right around as they get provided to the counselors pending our comms team getting them up the same day or not So, thank you, and I'll hand it off to Paula from in this associates I Thank you, Alicia, thank you madam chair I

51
00:08:48,641 --> 00:08:55,105
I'm Paula Thomas Martinez urban planner and designer from associates.

52
00:08:55,125 --> 00:09:00,108
I'm here with my colleague Jimmy Russia GIS specialist.

53
00:09:00,808 --> 00:09:05,411
So I'm going to show the presentation that I have prepared for all of you.

54
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:12,352
I'm going to go very quickly through the agenda.

55
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:18,395
We're going to talk about today only the Mystic Avenue corridor.

56
00:09:18,795 --> 00:09:22,577
We're going to talk about land use and we have some proposals.

57
00:09:22,657 --> 00:09:26,699
So we have usually two proposals for each of these topics.

58
00:09:28,219 --> 00:09:32,960
One is going to be the land use, so we will be looking at two different land use plans.

59
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:39,581
Then two sets of dimensional standards and a table of uses.

60
00:09:41,501 --> 00:09:46,202
For the next steps, so that's what we will talk today.

61
00:09:46,662 --> 00:09:54,104
Next week, we will be going through the draft for a green score and the housing definitions that we bring last time.

62
00:09:55,884 --> 00:09:56,104
Sorry.

63
00:09:57,204 --> 00:10:06,048
And then we will, next week from that we will be looking at the Mystic Avenue zoning proposal and the green score proposal.

64
00:10:07,508 --> 00:10:14,251
So in the timeline today we're going to talk about the Mystic Avenue, land use, use table and dimensional standards mainly.

65
00:10:15,091 --> 00:10:18,192
October 9, the green score and housing definitions.

66
00:10:21,101 --> 00:10:22,241
we will be looking at the draft for incentive zoning.

67
00:10:22,261 --> 00:10:22,381
Sorry.

68
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:22,842
Then October 23.

69
00:10:22,902 --> 00:10:28,103
We will try to, um we will bring the zoning proposal for Mystic Avenue and Green score.

70
00:10:28,903 --> 00:10:34,925
After that, we will be looking at the draft for incentive zoning and November November 27th.

71
00:10:34,965 --> 00:10:37,046
We will try to bring Salem Street.

72
00:10:37,586 --> 00:10:40,007
So any proposal and incentive zoning.

73
00:10:40,987 --> 00:10:42,288
We'll see for November 27th if that is

74
00:10:52,129 --> 00:10:54,251
So today we're going to talk about Mystic Avenue.

75
00:10:54,271 --> 00:10:56,533
This is something that we have already seen.

76
00:10:56,753 --> 00:10:58,895
I'm just going to go very quickly through it.

77
00:11:00,296 --> 00:11:08,462
The black lots in the solid black hatch are proposed to be added parcels to the boundary.

78
00:11:09,323 --> 00:11:10,124
This we agreed.

79
00:11:12,265 --> 00:11:23,580
Then we have some proposals that we wanted to add it as the part of the boundary, but we still need to have some more public communication to see if that is really possible.

80
00:11:24,061 --> 00:11:28,106
So the dashed line ones boundaries are still to study.

81
00:11:31,415 --> 00:11:41,538
We talk about the bigger connections and where we wanted the accents of landmarks and active ground floor and where the land uses came from.

82
00:11:42,038 --> 00:11:48,780
So if anyone has questions about this, we can totally talk about this, but this was already discussed.

83
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,781
So I'm going to go quickly over.

84
00:11:51,981 --> 00:11:54,102
We have the land use of the existing.

85
00:11:54,142 --> 00:11:57,243
This is the current land use of Mystic Avenue.

86
00:11:57,963 --> 00:12:00,904
And on our boundary, what we have is a lot of commercial.

87
00:12:00,964 --> 00:12:04,166
This is the C2 zoning and industrial.

88
00:12:04,326 --> 00:12:05,687
That's the violet one.

89
00:12:06,207 --> 00:12:10,549
So mainly where we are is looking at those land uses.

90
00:12:11,449 --> 00:12:18,312
A lot of what we have right now is mainly auto-oriented uses, warehouses.

91
00:12:18,552 --> 00:12:22,074
It's not exactly that it's permitted, but that's what we are finding today.

92
00:12:23,435 --> 00:12:26,987
Um, the standards for the C two zoning.

93
00:12:27,469 --> 00:12:28,753
It's mainly, um

94
00:12:30,626 --> 00:12:38,651
The main things that we need to see is that the lot coverage is the 50% of the lot can only be built.

95
00:12:39,112 --> 00:12:39,832
That's a 50%.

96
00:12:40,753 --> 00:12:43,675
And we have two stories as maximum height.

97
00:12:44,235 --> 00:12:45,536
And that's what we see here.

98
00:12:46,537 --> 00:12:53,942
As well, we have 15 feet setback from any of the lot lines.

99
00:12:54,002 --> 00:12:58,885
So front side and rear setbacks are 15 feet.

100
00:13:00,606 --> 00:13:01,928
So this is what we have.

101
00:13:02,729 --> 00:13:17,746
And here in orange, you can see the important things that I would like you to really stay with this content to compare it with what we are going to propose.

102
00:13:19,042 --> 00:13:35,960
So this is mainly the existing conditions that we have in mystic in the left side of the image is this is where we start from Medford Square, and then towards the end is the Somerville.

103
00:13:38,042 --> 00:13:38,322
site.

104
00:13:38,962 --> 00:13:42,485
So what you can see is that also the street is going to change a lot.

105
00:13:42,626 --> 00:14:04,925
What we mainly have is auto-oriented uses, a lot of warehouse, mainly it's an asphalt landscape, so not very much sustainable, and not very active or nice and vibrant to walk in these areas.

106
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:17,934
So what we are proposing, and this was something that we also presented last time, we had these four different sub areas in the Mystic Avenue corridor.

107
00:14:18,435 --> 00:14:21,936
And what we did is change a bit the last part of it.

108
00:14:23,206 --> 00:14:40,402
So the first area that is more towards the Medford Square connection that starts in Main Street, we wanted to have a very, like it was historically, smaller scale mixed use and very active ground floor.

109
00:14:42,003 --> 00:14:48,409
When we go to, and we will see these standards just in a second, so I just want to explain first the land use.

110
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:59,018
Mixed-use, it means that we can have commercial, we can have residential, we can have even combined uses.

111
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:08,866
Then we have mixed-use two, and it was also smaller scale, but a bit bigger than mixed-use one.

112
00:15:09,767 --> 00:15:17,072
That is the soft bioled area on the west side of Mystic Avenue.

113
00:15:17,933 --> 00:15:37,298
And then on the right side of Mystic Avenue, this darker purple-violet, this is where we want the bigger scale, higher buildings because we have the highway, so we have place to go really high, and we will see the heights that we propose just in a second.

114
00:15:38,218 --> 00:15:48,142
So the last part and this is where I wanted to focus because this is the difference between both of the land uses, and it's on the southern part of mystic Avenue towards Somerville.

115
00:15:49,422 --> 00:15:50,903
So in this case for these.

116
00:15:53,345 --> 00:15:56,869
land use option, we have as well mixed use.

117
00:15:57,349 --> 00:16:00,613
But it's going to be a mixed use that is going to have more commercial.

118
00:16:01,695 --> 00:16:08,222
In this area, in this land use option, we do not permit any auto-oriented uses.

119
00:16:08,983 --> 00:16:10,763
in anywhere in Mystic Avenue.

120
00:16:11,283 --> 00:16:18,165
So the commercial parts that we would have it's more of kind of lab buildings.

121
00:16:19,605 --> 00:16:34,968
We also want some light industrial but that is a bit that is possible to have with residential and that means some makers art space that can happen with residential.

122
00:16:35,068 --> 00:16:35,708
So we will be

123
00:16:36,388 --> 00:16:47,717
having to add some definitions for what that light industrial means in here, what is the scale of those areas, and how it can be combined with residential.

124
00:16:48,437 --> 00:16:55,302
So a bit of more kind of very active, but working type of mixed use.

125
00:16:56,423 --> 00:16:58,124
So a bit different from the others.

126
00:16:59,845 --> 00:17:06,828
And then on the second option, what I'm going to show now is the dimension standards for this option for this land use.

127
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:11,691
So as you can see, we have from smaller scale to bigger scale.

128
00:17:12,511 --> 00:17:14,532
from mixed use one, two, and three.

129
00:17:14,712 --> 00:17:15,912
Three is the biggest one.

130
00:17:16,472 --> 00:17:30,836
We have the building heights in this side is going to be mixed use one, four, and this is, I just want to remember that is in the northern area of Mystic Avenue.

131
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:34,657
This is maximum six stories high.

132
00:17:35,477 --> 00:17:39,558
with having a step back on above the fourth floor.

133
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:48,861
So we have four stories, then we have a step back of 10 foot, and then we have two other stories extra.

134
00:17:49,582 --> 00:17:59,125
For mixed use two, and that is this Western part of Mystic Avenue in the central area, that is mixed use two, it's also small.

135
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:04,528
scale bigger than the mixed use one.

136
00:18:04,949 --> 00:18:08,211
And what we have is six, maximum six stories high.

137
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:18,279
So remember that for now, the current is only two and we have 80% of lot coverage.

138
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,443
And that was previously was, so the current one is 50.

139
00:18:23,283 --> 00:18:27,106
We're going to 80% coverage for mixed use one, two and three.

140
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:31,869
And then the mixed use is the three is the bigger scale.

141
00:18:32,269 --> 00:18:36,190
We have a plinth of four stories high.

142
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:44,093
Then we have a step back and from there we can have a tower kind of eight more stories.

143
00:18:44,133 --> 00:18:48,415
So in total for mixed use three, we have 12 stories high buildings.

144
00:18:50,042 --> 00:18:54,005
For mixed use, four is the medium to big scale.

145
00:18:54,346 --> 00:19:03,313
This is the most commercial and where we also want to have some kind of lab, um, lab buildings and light industrial.

146
00:19:04,173 --> 00:19:12,139
Um, so we have eight stories, uh, eight story buildings as maximum height, and we have a bit of less lot coverage in this one is 70%.

147
00:19:16,032 --> 00:19:24,824
These are the main differences from the existing to what we are proposing now.

148
00:19:25,725 --> 00:19:27,648
We have the second proposal.

149
00:19:29,983 --> 00:19:46,528
And so, as you can see, is the same from the north until the last and southern part of Mystic Avenue, where what we do is extend the Mixuse 3 all the way for the east side.

150
00:19:47,288 --> 00:19:57,952
And that is mainly because we have the highway and we have the buffer and the length and the depth on the lots to be able to go quite high.

151
00:19:58,786 --> 00:20:01,407
And so that's why we extended on the east side.

152
00:20:02,127 --> 00:20:07,429
And then on the west side, what we do is propose only commercial.

153
00:20:07,529 --> 00:20:17,853
So in this area, we wouldn't have the residential possibility is mainly, sorry, I had some, yeah, I'm connected.

154
00:20:17,974 --> 00:20:18,954
I had some issues.

155
00:20:19,014 --> 00:20:20,274
Okay, it's all good.

156
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:24,136
So on the west side, it's only commercial.

157
00:20:24,576 --> 00:20:26,377
And in this case, we would be,

158
00:20:28,549 --> 00:20:30,550
permitting auto-oriented uses.

159
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:33,833
Sorry?

160
00:20:34,513 --> 00:20:40,778
Yeah, I have some... Why do I have this?

161
00:20:41,058 --> 00:20:45,501
Yeah, I was logged off the Zoom.

162
00:20:45,521 --> 00:20:47,022
That's okay, we'll get you back up there.

163
00:20:48,543 --> 00:20:50,905
You just have to go back to the link and reconnect to Zoom.

164
00:20:51,345 --> 00:20:53,287
Yeah, I will exactly do that.

165
00:21:07,956 --> 00:21:13,120
Sorry, for some reason I was, my internet kind of went all over the place.

166
00:21:13,421 --> 00:21:18,845
That's okay, let's take a beat and we're gonna get Paola's presentation back up.

167
00:21:19,545 --> 00:21:21,287
I'll take a question from Councillor Callahan.

168
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:25,201
So I think Paola probably won't be able to respond for a couple moments.

169
00:21:25,942 --> 00:21:29,085
Oh, I just figured while we're getting the Zoom up, we could ask some questions.

170
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:32,608
Yeah, I think, yeah, I just want to give her a second to figure out her computer trouble.

171
00:21:33,248 --> 00:21:33,569
Okay.

172
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:38,673
I will share now.

173
00:21:39,013 --> 00:21:43,978
It's wired, so you don't lose Wi-Fi ever if you're plugged in there.

174
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:49,543
It may be a solution for if we have Wi-Fi issues.

175
00:21:50,404 --> 00:21:54,406
Looks like we're fine now, but it was just a note if you wanted to present.

176
00:21:54,426 --> 00:22:00,629
Okay, I'm back.

177
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:02,150
Sorry.

178
00:22:03,831 --> 00:22:04,031
Great.

179
00:22:05,192 --> 00:22:05,512
Go for it.

180
00:22:07,901 --> 00:22:19,444
Yes, so in this area, we would kind of want to maintain these auto-oriented uses that are already there, wanted to phase them a bit.

181
00:22:20,145 --> 00:22:27,467
We choose this area because of the connections that we have with the infrastructure, especially

182
00:22:28,267 --> 00:22:53,599
southern part of Mystic Avenue, and because on the other side we had the possibilities to go higher, that's why we placed them on the west side, this commercial area where we can have also life science, some light industrial, no residential, and also be able to have some auto-oriented uses.

183
00:22:55,020 --> 00:23:02,209
So the dimensionless standards and what you're going to see here, the standards are very similar only for the commercial.

184
00:23:02,769 --> 00:23:13,662
What we have is that we add some further front setback that goes from zero or three that we had in the other option to 20 feet.

185
00:23:16,242 --> 00:23:22,384
What the other part that you see that is a bit more transparent, this is if we go for incentive zoning or not.

186
00:23:22,704 --> 00:23:31,867
So it doesn't have to do with the option itself, but it's more with the possibility of doing this with incentive zoning.

187
00:23:32,067 --> 00:23:33,828
And it's something that I will explain later.

188
00:23:34,348 --> 00:23:42,191
But mainly if we go with incentive zoning, the maximum height we will have for mixed use one will be four stories high.

189
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:46,452
and that is, as of right, pre-incentive zoning.

190
00:23:47,233 --> 00:23:55,178
If we want to go through the incentive zoning, then they could add two more stories, and that would be the total six for Mixed Use 1.

191
00:23:55,999 --> 00:23:58,560
And as well for Mixed Use 2, we would have four.

192
00:23:59,041 --> 00:24:02,903
If we go for zoning incentive, then we could have plus two.

193
00:24:03,464 --> 00:24:06,586
And with the Mixed Use 3, it would go even a bit higher.

194
00:24:07,046 --> 00:24:15,331
we would have 10 for the tower-like piece, and then we could add four more.

195
00:24:15,451 --> 00:24:19,733
So in total, having 14, the store is high for the mixed-use three.

196
00:24:20,494 --> 00:24:23,495
And then the commercial, it would be six plus two.

197
00:24:24,376 --> 00:24:29,459
So this is only if we go for incentive zoning in Mystic Avenue or not.

198
00:24:29,619 --> 00:24:33,561
It doesn't have to do really with the option that we are looking at.

199
00:24:33,581 --> 00:24:35,002
I have a quick question on that.

200
00:24:35,938 --> 00:24:41,301
The incentive zoning that you just outlined, would that be for both land use option A and option B?

201
00:24:41,621 --> 00:24:42,362
It could be, yes.

202
00:24:42,442 --> 00:24:43,002
Okay, thank you.

203
00:24:43,022 --> 00:24:46,384
I just want to clarify that's not specific to option B. Yeah, exactly.

204
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:55,203
So now we get into the comparison.

205
00:24:56,864 --> 00:24:58,425
I would love to hear your opinions.

206
00:24:59,686 --> 00:25:04,890
So now I'm going to give the councillors the option to tell me what they think about.

207
00:25:05,331 --> 00:25:16,279
And this is not A or B, we can still modify it, we can still work a version that satisfies us, all of us.

208
00:25:18,114 --> 00:25:19,095
Great, thank you, Pella.

209
00:25:19,115 --> 00:25:26,699
I'll go to questions and comments from councillors, and then I'm really eager to hear our planning staff's perspective on this comparison and this menu of options as well.

210
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:27,760
Councillor Callahan.

211
00:25:28,841 --> 00:25:29,741
Thank you.

212
00:25:29,881 --> 00:25:35,465
So I have one, just a question for my own curiosity, and then I also have a suggestion.

213
00:25:35,905 --> 00:25:42,809
So I'm curious why the commercial is like 50% lot coverage and the other ones are 80% lot coverage.

214
00:25:42,849 --> 00:25:45,131
Is that like a standard thing, and is there a reason why that's so?

215
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:52,735
So this is because of the type of commercial that is at the moment there.

216
00:25:53,836 --> 00:26:03,464
They have this 50% load coverage that with the setbacks that they have, because it's 15 feet all the way, almost with the setbacks, you're already in 50%.

217
00:26:04,745 --> 00:26:06,527
So that's why they have the 50% at the moment.

218
00:26:08,028 --> 00:26:13,372
Um, we in these options in neither of these two options, we have 50 we go.

219
00:26:13,392 --> 00:26:21,838
The minimum is 70% because we really want to have a Continuous facade and give more.

220
00:26:23,019 --> 00:26:25,801
And I saw that and I'm curious about like permeable surfaces.

221
00:26:26,002 --> 00:26:27,763
If it's going to be 80% lot coverage.

222
00:26:28,023 --> 00:26:33,247
Do we have a recurrent just because I know in that area, we're really concerned about it being a heat island.

223
00:26:34,492 --> 00:26:40,977
Yes, and so for that, we would go through the green score option that we will look into next time.

224
00:26:41,517 --> 00:26:49,142
And especially because in this area, what we also want is to create that more full facade to be more active and vibrant.

225
00:26:49,483 --> 00:26:51,904
We need to go to other types of solutions.

226
00:26:52,385 --> 00:26:58,129
And that can be, for example, we required a 30 foot setback from the highway.

227
00:26:58,689 --> 00:27:09,774
So that can be really green buffer to help us clean the air, but also be a stormwater management area that can count towards the green score.

228
00:27:11,014 --> 00:27:20,138
Green or blue roofs that will help us so that we can really have different elements that can help towards the management of stormwater.

229
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,860
My final, oh, did you?

230
00:27:24,417 --> 00:27:36,522
I actually just wanted to add on that, that there are both, for this particular corridor, the city, well, for the whole city, the city has stormwater regulations about how much stormwater must be treated on site.

231
00:27:37,042 --> 00:27:49,828
So by having less open space, they will have to still treat it on site, and so then they have underground storage tanks that open into the ground, so it'll funnel into there, and then it'll drain in.

232
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,120
that way.

233
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:58,743
So there will be requirements that they'd have to meet, and they'd have to meet it more with structure rather than like just pretty trees.

234
00:28:00,483 --> 00:28:12,488
The other is that MassDOT has stormwater regulations about what you have to treat and hold and capture on site versus what's allowed to go into the road.

235
00:28:13,348 --> 00:28:18,770
So those will play in, and as we're developing the green score for the citywide, we'll need to

236
00:28:19,915 --> 00:28:25,101
take a look at what our stormwater regulations are to make sure that we're at least as strict as those.

237
00:28:26,463 --> 00:28:29,627
But then also we'll know that DOT has some rules around that.

238
00:28:29,847 --> 00:28:31,248
So I figured I should add that in.

239
00:28:32,005 --> 00:28:32,686
Thanks.

240
00:28:32,726 --> 00:28:51,048
My final kind of suggestion was, because I live down there and I'm, and I, my kid goes to the method took looking at option B. I wonder if, rather than that sort of southwestern portion being all commercial, if it's possible to split that and have commercial.

241
00:28:52,469 --> 00:29:04,276
Right on the road and then having those back parcels be mixed use or something else not have so much of the audio auto usage close to the school and the park and also this public housing there.

242
00:29:05,397 --> 00:29:12,141
So having you know a little bit nicer usages right butting up to those those three would be great.

243
00:29:13,901 --> 00:29:15,842
Yes, I think that's a great suggestion.

244
00:29:15,902 --> 00:29:18,182
That's why we also do the first option.

245
00:29:19,322 --> 00:29:22,543
But I think that that could complement very well the option B. So thank you.

246
00:29:25,504 --> 00:29:26,804
Thank you, President Beers.

247
00:29:28,065 --> 00:29:29,525
Thank you, Madam Chair.

248
00:29:29,885 --> 00:29:33,246
To Councillor Callaghan's point, I think maybe

249
00:29:35,131 --> 00:29:48,277
the easiest way to move in that direction would be to do mixed use one on those parcels that are kind of on that leg of the, I'm a pro option B, I'm pro incentive zoning.

250
00:29:49,498 --> 00:29:50,939
That would be what I would move for.

251
00:29:51,019 --> 00:29:52,720
But I think that's a well taken point.

252
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:57,302
And maybe that leg could be like MX one, and maybe it's even MX one with no incentive zoning.

253
00:29:57,402 --> 00:29:58,803
So it stays at four stories.

254
00:30:00,683 --> 00:30:01,344
Either way on that.

255
00:30:02,024 --> 00:30:03,685
But I think that might make sense for like,

256
00:30:04,588 --> 00:30:17,696
just those parcels that are almost southwest of the park line, if that makes sense on the map, kind of that dog that comes out of that district.

257
00:30:19,617 --> 00:30:21,158
So that's just my suggestion there.

258
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:28,162
I think on the lot coverage question, I think the stormwater and all that and the green score is great, but I also just think

259
00:30:28,922 --> 00:30:30,083
the open space minimum.

260
00:30:30,664 --> 00:30:31,785
Minimums are really good too.

261
00:30:31,845 --> 00:30:41,815
I think we'll, you know, even with increased building size, we're going to see increased green space because right now, even at 50% lot coverage, it's 100% impermeable.

262
00:30:42,096 --> 00:30:44,658
So that's kind of where I think we'll get a benefit there.

263
00:30:44,698 --> 00:30:47,521
And then maybe even additional benefit from incentive and green score.

264
00:30:49,209 --> 00:31:00,058
I had a question about the maximum setbacks, especially in the mixed-use two and mixed-use three, and even the mixed-use one.

265
00:31:00,898 --> 00:31:08,464
It just seems like a lot to allow a 20-foot setback in addition to when we're already gonna have to have an 18-foot street setback.

266
00:31:09,585 --> 00:31:14,810
And I'm just wondering if that might make it look disjointed or affect the frontage that we're trying to create.

267
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:18,773
So I'm wondering what your thought was on that.

268
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:24,273
It's like the three slash 20.

269
00:31:25,575 --> 00:31:28,260
The minimum makes sense, the maximum seems really big.

270
00:31:28,801 --> 00:31:30,984
So, yes, and that is depending on.

271
00:31:32,946 --> 00:31:34,187
in what you have to do.

272
00:31:34,207 --> 00:31:35,868
That is something that I wanted to talk at the end.

273
00:31:36,308 --> 00:31:45,934
So these minimum and maximums, what we want is that whenever they go towards a maximum, it's because they are giving something to the public realm.

274
00:31:46,414 --> 00:31:55,920
So they are doing a plaza or they are building something that it has to be active or landscape for stormwater management.

275
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:56,981
And that's why we

276
00:31:58,248 --> 00:32:10,195
if they can do it because there are some in mixed use two and mixed use three especially that are very deep lots where they could go to that 20 foot.

277
00:32:10,835 --> 00:32:24,203
We don't want more than that because we don't want to have a disconnection between the building and the street, but we can let that happen if it is a very active front building, front yard.

278
00:32:24,223 --> 00:32:26,204
And I guess my question with that being,

279
00:32:27,423 --> 00:32:32,007
If we just write that in as the setback, could they just do whatever they want, put a parking lot in there?

280
00:32:32,807 --> 00:32:38,311
No, no parking lots are available, would be possible in the front yard.

281
00:32:38,812 --> 00:32:44,616
And we're gonna write that into the performance standards for the district?

282
00:32:44,636 --> 00:32:44,797
Yeah.

283
00:32:44,817 --> 00:32:47,559
Okay, great, because that's just my concern with the 20 foot.

284
00:32:50,381 --> 00:32:54,864
And I know we're gonna talk about the other front setback, street setback thing later, so I won't go into that.

285
00:32:57,096 --> 00:33:24,892
I just also think, I mean, and maybe Danielle could speak to this a little bit, the proposed additional adding in the parcels, it looks like we've agreed, and I think we may have voted on including the stuff between South and Thomas Street in the MX1 district, so that's why that's in the map, so that's good, that's like on slide four, it's the black shaded parcels, so that's, we've already agreed we wanna include that.

286
00:33:27,881 --> 00:33:29,101
dotted line areas.

287
00:33:30,942 --> 00:33:33,522
Danielle, it sounded like you had gone out a little bit in the neighborhood.

288
00:33:33,562 --> 00:33:36,023
Were you able to go out in any of those parts of the neighborhood?

289
00:33:38,884 --> 00:33:40,444
Okay.

290
00:33:41,024 --> 00:33:48,906
My inclination would be to say, just leave the ones with mystic affrontage in and

291
00:33:49,815 --> 00:34:03,705
at least for now, it might just simplify our process if we were to say for now, let's just leave the Mystic Ave frontage things in and we can come back when we're doing the neighborhood zoning and decide if we want to put some sort of like step up in those dashed areas.

292
00:34:05,947 --> 00:34:11,011
Just because it's, you know, those are the places where it's most abrupt.

293
00:34:11,071 --> 00:34:14,193
And I think that's why we've, we're like, do we do it?

294
00:34:14,233 --> 00:34:15,014
Do we not do it?

295
00:34:15,632 --> 00:34:25,274
I could see an argument for the like Hancock Street, Crescent Street, Mystic Ave block, maybe more than the next block on Hancock Street.

296
00:34:26,334 --> 00:34:29,455
And then the Bonner Ave one is, the Bonner and Alexander one is just tough, right?

297
00:34:29,535 --> 00:34:40,318
It's what, eight or nine or 10 like residential houses that are just right there, whereas on the rest of the corridor, that was not allowed to be built.

298
00:34:43,482 --> 00:34:44,863
That would be my suggestion for those.

299
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:47,783
I think we could talk about it later.

300
00:34:47,803 --> 00:34:58,207
I'd be willing to make it in the form of a motion to just include the yellow highlighted parcels in this first round and we can come back when we look at the neighborhood zoning around the dotted line ones.

301
00:34:58,707 --> 00:35:04,109
But I'm interested to hear what you guys have to say and what the planning department's thoughts are on that especially.

302
00:35:07,108 --> 00:35:08,169
All right, Madam Chair.

303
00:35:08,729 --> 00:35:19,857
So one way of looking at it is it doesn't impact the people who currently live there in terms of what their houses are and what they have.

304
00:35:20,518 --> 00:35:22,879
It would impact who they could sell to.

305
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:33,347
So it would basically, in theory, make their houses more valuable that a developer might want to come by them and build something bigger there and aggregate a bunch of parcels.

306
00:35:33,877 --> 00:35:35,978
because it would already be in the zoning area.

307
00:35:36,518 --> 00:35:38,819
So there'd be an incentive to that.

308
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:50,003
But I do also see that it can be concerning to the residents who live next to it, because then they're like, well, now these bigger buildings are going to push out closer and closer to my homes.

309
00:35:50,543 --> 00:35:56,586
So it might actually be the people the next block out who have more of a concern than the people in the block.

310
00:35:58,266 --> 00:35:59,667
So just to think of it that way.

311
00:36:00,211 --> 00:36:06,595
around the Hancock area, I think what's easy to think of as the inner block makes a lot of sense.

312
00:36:06,695 --> 00:36:21,744
I'm pretty sure that almost all of it is already owned by one party, and that would just kind of open up that development potential, whereas the outer one is where all the houses are, but it does, can one developer now come and build closer?

313
00:36:21,764 --> 00:36:27,628
I mean, the reality is we have a really good planning community development board,

314
00:36:28,066 --> 00:36:44,817
that will look at the site plans for something anybody that tried to build on 10,000 buildings 10,000 square feet or more has to go to site plan review, and they look at and spend a lot of time, how is this interfacing with the community, how is this impacting the immediate butters.

315
00:36:46,676 --> 00:36:50,441
So one thing that I would say is that we may want to hear from some of those neighbors.

316
00:36:51,041 --> 00:36:53,124
It makes sense perhaps to push it off.

317
00:36:53,725 --> 00:37:04,338
My instinct is to keep the inner block of the sorry that I don't see all the, I think it's Hancock Crescent, there are three different streets named with Hancock like right there.

318
00:37:07,635 --> 00:37:10,837
But I think it's clear if people are looking at the screen what we're talking about.

319
00:37:11,237 --> 00:37:17,181
And these maps are all up on the website and this PowerPoint will be up on the website within, I would say, a day or so.

320
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:18,042
Great.

321
00:37:18,482 --> 00:37:27,869
Yeah, and I think for Bonner and Alexander, my thought is you have basically what 10 to 15 year old new development that is the frontage on Mystic Ave.

322
00:37:28,516 --> 00:37:32,057
So if someone was to bundle those parcels, they're probably not knocking that thing down.

323
00:37:33,258 --> 00:37:38,220
So it's not even really on Mystic Ave if they bundled those and built those.

324
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:40,821
So that is where I'm most inclined.

325
00:37:41,061 --> 00:37:49,685
And I tend to agree with you on that middle, the dotted lines around the Hancock Streets, Hancock Court, Hancock Ave, Hancock Street, I think.

326
00:37:51,706 --> 00:37:54,187
I mislabeled the Facebook event on the wrong one one time.

327
00:37:56,243 --> 00:37:57,184
go collect everybody.

328
00:37:58,004 --> 00:38:01,727
Um, yeah, so that's just my thought.

329
00:38:01,787 --> 00:38:03,829
I'll leave motions till the end of the discussion.

330
00:38:06,531 --> 00:38:06,831
Thank you.

331
00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:08,833
I think I saw a hand from Councilor Lemming.

332
00:38:10,894 --> 00:38:11,555
Yeah.

333
00:38:11,575 --> 00:38:12,735
Um, so

334
00:38:13,982 --> 00:38:26,647
Right now, sorry, just to, Council President Barrett, just to clarify, was your suggestion to replace the Southwest parcel there that differs between A and B with mixed-use one?

335
00:38:26,667 --> 00:38:30,568
Just wanted to clarify if I, sorry.

336
00:38:30,628 --> 00:38:34,349
I meant the parcels here on Hicks Ave.

337
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:36,250
Here.

338
00:38:38,571 --> 00:38:38,711
Yeah.

339
00:38:47,188 --> 00:38:51,155
Back, you mentioned that maybe keeping that not having incentive zoning and keeping that to.

340
00:38:51,835 --> 00:38:53,897
Maybe, that was just an idea, yeah.

341
00:38:54,177 --> 00:38:55,678
I wasn't sure if he was asking about that, so.

342
00:38:55,718 --> 00:39:18,718
It's really everything, I mean, if folks have been back there, you have whatever number rear Mystic Avenue, and then there's a private long road that's really like a parking lot, and that abuts the park and the school property, well, it abuts the park and then some industrial, basically anything that side of what is currently proposed as the commercial zone is what I'm thinking of.

343
00:39:19,518 --> 00:39:35,407
Okay, yeah, for I mean, yeah, for the for the stuff that's like right next to the mistook I could definitely see the argument for making that into mixed use one but for yeah for the rest of that area like I run around that kind of spot of that parcel land all the time and it.

344
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:37,548
It's very underutilized.

345
00:39:37,568 --> 00:39:38,549
There's like two banks there.

346
00:39:38,569 --> 00:39:42,532
So I think it absolutely makes sense to build higher properties there.

347
00:39:43,893 --> 00:39:47,356
Like, it's basically what's abutting the school, the park and the public housing.

348
00:39:47,516 --> 00:39:49,277
Yeah, yeah, no, no, that.

349
00:39:49,597 --> 00:39:49,818
Okay.

350
00:39:49,838 --> 00:39:51,639
Yeah, I thought I misheard.

351
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:53,961
I thought you were suggesting to make that entire thing.

352
00:39:53,981 --> 00:39:55,082
No, excuse one.

353
00:39:55,122 --> 00:39:55,782
Okay.

354
00:39:56,563 --> 00:39:56,663
Um,

355
00:39:58,843 --> 00:40:15,333
General question about this, because I'm kind of thinking about what that would look like between mixed use, between option A and B. Which of the mixed use three versus mixed use four would developers normally be inclined to go for?

356
00:40:15,533 --> 00:40:24,479
Is there a situation where we decide on one and then developers are like, well, I don't think it's worth it to do that, but they wouldn't do that for the other?

357
00:40:25,992 --> 00:40:35,718
What I'm thinking of is like when we do pass one of these, would there be any difference in sort of estimated uptake of that?

358
00:40:41,862 --> 00:40:50,907
I think that it depends a lot on the developers and what their priorities are and what they're looking to do.

359
00:40:52,395 --> 00:40:58,059
One of the things that I have absolutely heard is that developers like to stay under a certain height.

360
00:40:58,119 --> 00:41:00,861
So they're not classified as high rises.

361
00:41:01,482 --> 00:41:03,223
And I think that that's 96 feet.

362
00:41:03,423 --> 00:41:06,405
I'm looking at our building commissioner.

363
00:41:07,786 --> 00:41:08,786
Maybe seven stories.

364
00:41:08,866 --> 00:41:14,150
Yeah, there's because if they go over certain height, they trigger all kinds of other things.

365
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:21,635
So there's like some sweet spots to around how much parking versus apartments and stuff like that.

366
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:37,142
So we often hear things like three over one and four over two being three floors of apartments over one floor of parking, or four floors of apartments over two floors of parking.

367
00:41:38,063 --> 00:41:44,929
And some of that has to do with their ratios of what is affordable and what they can finance.

368
00:41:45,473 --> 00:41:58,461
Some of it has to do like the maximum heights and stories of the building have to do with building code and like at what point do they trigger different things in the building code that suddenly make it more expensive to build a taller building.

369
00:41:59,341 --> 00:42:05,525
So once you hit a certain height, then you want to go really high because you've already triggering all those more expensive things.

370
00:42:05,905 --> 00:42:09,027
So now you want to maximize the amount of density on your property.

371
00:42:10,204 --> 00:42:22,447
So that's something that we've also been, I have been reaching out to developers and asking them to also take a look at a webpage, maybe watch the meetings if they wanna speak up or reach out to me directly when they see stuff like this.

372
00:42:22,807 --> 00:42:36,369
What was interesting was that the biggest comment, most, the strongest comment that I got had to do with the ratio of affordable housing and the depth of affordability and was not about setbacks and heights.

373
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:39,510
So I just thought that was really interesting.

374
00:42:41,105 --> 00:42:44,507
But we're still trying to get some more input on this.

375
00:42:45,107 --> 00:43:00,333
So just sorry, just just to summarize, like, so in theory, it sounded like that was kind of an implicit endorsement of option A, which is, you know, has more of the mixed use mixed use for which is sort of denser, but not quite as high.

376
00:43:00,393 --> 00:43:06,535
But what you were just saying now is that developers were, they didn't in

377
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:14,021
In practice, they didn't really seem to care about the specific heights as much as the sort of depth of affordability when they were building housing.

378
00:43:14,922 --> 00:43:16,042
When they were building housing.

379
00:43:16,842 --> 00:43:26,704
The thing is, if you're going to like life science and R&D and other types of things, then the heights and the requirements, but then they have different building code requirements.

380
00:43:27,144 --> 00:43:34,005
Because now if you're doing R&D in the building requirements, then if you're living, have people living in the building.

381
00:43:34,726 --> 00:43:36,806
So some of that and what do you design for that?

382
00:43:39,258 --> 00:43:47,465
I think that, in general, they'll say, give us more because then we have more options, right?

383
00:43:47,525 --> 00:44:02,256
If you say it's 12 stories is allowed, and they think it's more affordable, or let's just say it's a better return on their investment to build six stories, then maybe they'll only build the six stories, even though we allow more.

384
00:44:05,047 --> 00:44:07,549
I realize it feels very, very wishy-washy.

385
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:17,416
But what I'm mostly saying is that these are all within the realm of much more desirable than the two-story industrial that we have.

386
00:44:18,037 --> 00:44:21,539
And so none of these are going to be prohibitive.

387
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:29,065
I think four-story can get a little, you're going to get different things if you are allowing four-story than if you're allowing five, six.

388
00:44:30,304 --> 00:44:30,584
more.

389
00:44:30,604 --> 00:44:31,685
So follow up to that.

390
00:44:31,725 --> 00:44:39,207
So what all of the different rules and incentives that are, um, that make developers make these decisions?

391
00:44:39,247 --> 00:44:42,388
Would those be baked into the zoning at the ordinance level?

392
00:44:42,468 --> 00:44:48,951
Or would those be baked into rules that are sort of decided to staff level as a result of studies?

393
00:44:50,971 --> 00:44:54,013
So with the staff level, we don't have regulations.

394
00:44:54,873 --> 00:44:58,154
I mean, I guess there's the stormwater regulations coming out of engineering.

395
00:44:58,917 --> 00:45:00,637
It's more what's in the ordinance.

396
00:45:02,458 --> 00:45:12,239
And some of what we haven't gotten to yet is this idea of incentive zoning, where we say, here's how much you're allowed to build, but if you do these things we like, you can go higher.

397
00:45:12,799 --> 00:45:28,302
And so I do think we want to look at that, because that may sort of get at some of what you're saying, because we've tried to take some of the things that we want, but have a lower return on investment for the developers.

398
00:45:28,803 --> 00:45:36,432
and try and say look, if you do these things we want, we'll increase your return on investment by allowing you to go higher and have more density.

399
00:45:39,025 --> 00:46:08,631
kind of trying to avoid is that when, you know, all of this has passed, if we end up baking in some rules that end up being really difficult to change, it just end up not working, or that end up just discouraging development, and then would have to go back and sort of redo all this versus, you know, some of these incentive zoning programs that we're talking about that could potentially be changed, sort of more at the staff level after, you know, a consultant does a study on that.

400
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:18,075
And that's actually, I think we should talk about, and I just wanna actually mention that we do have Jonathan Silverstein on the Zoom.

401
00:46:18,435 --> 00:46:24,959
So if we start to say, oh yeah, we can do that, and it turns out we're not allowed to do that, I'm sure he'll raise his hand and tell us that.

402
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:36,766
But yeah, we should look at how the incentive zoning works and whether that's stuff that can be changed by staff rather than through coming back to city council.

403
00:46:36,786 --> 00:46:37,766
It's a very good question.

404
00:46:40,333 --> 00:46:41,093
Do you have more questions?

405
00:46:41,153 --> 00:46:44,955
I had a couple little comments that almost played on some of what you were asking about, but.

406
00:46:46,216 --> 00:46:47,477
Anything more from you, Councilwoman?

407
00:46:47,957 --> 00:46:51,899
No, no, I'd like to hear more about this subject, but I don't have any more specific questions.

408
00:46:52,892 --> 00:46:53,072
Great.

409
00:46:53,172 --> 00:46:53,472
Thank you.

410
00:46:53,492 --> 00:46:57,996
And I think we will be diving into incentive zoning more deeply at our next committee meeting as well.

411
00:46:58,536 --> 00:46:59,497
So go for it.

412
00:46:59,837 --> 00:47:02,199
So some of we were looking at some of this stuff.

413
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:14,388
We really do like Councillor Callahan's suggestion of doing sort of a different zoning next to the public housing and the school and the playground.

414
00:47:14,769 --> 00:47:16,410
That makes a lot of sense to look at that.

415
00:47:17,622 --> 00:47:29,511
The other thing that when we dive into the use table, we want to think about which are the zones do we want to actually allow life science and more specifically R&D.

416
00:47:30,071 --> 00:47:39,038
R&D is a slightly more general term that like could be battery research or, you know, solar panel development, some of these other things.

417
00:47:39,098 --> 00:47:43,981
For example, there is battery development going on on Rear Mystic Ave.

418
00:47:44,041 --> 00:47:46,663
I got to go to the ribbon cutting for that company a couple years ago.

419
00:47:47,795 --> 00:48:04,001
So that's a more general term that I think is of interest to the community, that it's, yeah, part of it, it's not exactly commercial, it's not industrial, it's that sort of like, we're figuring this, we're doing research.

420
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:06,502
And so there are companies that do that.

421
00:48:06,962 --> 00:48:16,066
The other thing with the life science piece, and I've also now been hearing that it is also true with some of the clean tech

422
00:48:16,991 --> 00:48:24,789
projects is that you allow a higher so if an apartment building has 10 feet before between stories.

423
00:48:25,441 --> 00:48:34,303
And that's so standard that you typically would zone like, oh, you're allowed eight stories and 80 feet, or maybe your bottom floor is a little taller.

424
00:48:34,663 --> 00:48:37,063
So 85 feet, so your bottom floor is taller.

425
00:48:37,603 --> 00:48:44,445
If you were gonna allow life science, you might say eight stories and 105 feet.

426
00:48:44,925 --> 00:48:47,345
And a residential developer would go, well, that's weird.

427
00:48:47,405 --> 00:48:52,046
But a life science developer would say, that allows me to do eight stories of life science.

428
00:48:52,631 --> 00:49:10,449
So, one of the things that I was thinking about that I hadn't done it with that I is that we may want to consider what are our maximum heights and make them not logical to the number of residential stories, but logical to the number of life science stories.

429
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:17,394
that number out.

430
00:49:17,474 --> 00:49:32,166
We had a formula that we were using when we did the 02 zoning, because if you look at the 02 zone in Medford, that allows a certain number of stories and an oddly higher height, and that was to allow life science.

431
00:49:33,547 --> 00:49:33,747
So.

432
00:49:35,669 --> 00:49:35,969
Thank you.

433
00:49:36,029 --> 00:49:36,950
I'll just a second.

434
00:49:36,990 --> 00:49:37,370
Councilor Hill.

435
00:49:37,390 --> 00:49:38,031
Thank you so much.

436
00:49:38,151 --> 00:49:38,772
Just to jump in there.

437
00:49:38,792 --> 00:49:40,133
I'm glad you just spoke to that.

438
00:49:40,213 --> 00:49:42,755
That was a question that I had on, um,

439
00:49:45,365 --> 00:49:55,250
the mixed use lens uses in particular is like where those would include life science or research specifically.

440
00:49:56,190 --> 00:50:11,898
So I think that would be a great thing to get more specific on for our next committee meeting, or even if we could kind of have an update on that in two weeks, just so we can kind of understand, you know, I think it's especially when I look at mixed use three in either option A or B, I could certainly see it kind of on that.

441
00:50:13,086 --> 00:50:21,952
more northern side of Mystic, and I'm curious to get a little more specific on where we could see that, where we could see developers opting into that.

442
00:50:22,953 --> 00:50:29,477
And I'll hold my further two cents for, I'll go to, Paula, do you have a quick response or, okay, then we'll go to Councillor Callaghan.

443
00:50:30,258 --> 00:50:40,905
Yes, so this life science use was intended to be more in mixed use four, so more the southern part in option A.

444
00:50:42,146 --> 00:50:58,232
So that part of the pinkish area that we see that is meant to be commercial and the type of commercial was more about life science, light industrial so to have a bit of production with retail and also

445
00:51:00,033 --> 00:51:00,694
residential.

446
00:51:01,175 --> 00:51:21,615
So what we can, what I'm very interested to hear about is if that what do you want is to have these mixed use three extended or if you would like to have that mix for with life science commercial in the southern part east of Mystic Avenue.

447
00:51:23,134 --> 00:51:23,714
Thank you, Pella.

448
00:51:23,754 --> 00:51:36,456
And yeah, I think that is kind of one of our three critical decisions, or two or three critical decisions for tonight is, do we have mixed use four north of Mystic, or are we leaving that to mixed use three?

449
00:51:37,296 --> 00:51:41,357
And I do think part of my question on that, I like the ideas that have been posed so far.

450
00:51:41,397 --> 00:51:51,919
I certainly, I think that considering mixed use one for that area along Hicks, close to the park, the school, the housing, makes a lot of sense.

451
00:51:52,694 --> 00:51:57,436
kind of for the same motivations that we're putting Mixed Use 1 at the west end of Mystic.

452
00:51:57,476 --> 00:52:01,197
I think that putting Mixed Use 1 close to that, it's kind of a hub there.

453
00:52:01,237 --> 00:52:02,957
It's close to where a lot of streets join.

454
00:52:02,997 --> 00:52:08,679
We are starting to see some really nice ground floor commercial up at that joining.

455
00:52:08,719 --> 00:52:18,322
So I think that for a lot of reasons, changing that little elbow to Mixed Use 1 could improve either option.

456
00:52:18,342 --> 00:52:21,003
I'd personally like to know a little bit more about how

457
00:52:21,624 --> 00:52:26,406
life science and research could figure into mixed use three or the north side of Mystic.

458
00:52:26,926 --> 00:52:29,808
In either case, I'll go to Councilor Callahan and then President Behrs.

459
00:52:30,548 --> 00:52:31,488
Mine was actually very similar.

460
00:52:31,508 --> 00:52:44,414
I'm just curious if it would be useful for us to have a definition of life sciences or R&D in the definitions, or if simply having a maximum height that allows for taller stories would be enough.

461
00:52:47,991 --> 00:52:57,056
I think that we should add to the definitions anything that we will allow in this area because then it's easier to understand.

462
00:52:58,296 --> 00:53:10,443
If we want to have these type of buildings, which I hear yes, then we need to adjust the height levels because they are very different from residential as Alicia already explained.

463
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:15,145
And if I could just jump in here before I hand it over to President Behrs.

464
00:53:15,629 --> 00:53:28,675
In my understanding, like the way that these options unamended are presented to us right now, we could still like mixed use four, whether it's on both sides of Mystic or just one, developers could opt in to put life science and research there.

465
00:53:28,695 --> 00:53:35,858
It's just a question of, are we creating that kind of like natural environment on just the South side or on the North side as well?

466
00:53:36,698 --> 00:53:43,321
If it's the case that mixed use three is not exactly telegraphing life science to developers.

467
00:53:46,937 --> 00:53:47,297
Thank you.

468
00:53:47,437 --> 00:53:56,265
I just think we've already answered this question with the option B, which is defining maximum height by stories and not by amount of feet.

469
00:53:56,405 --> 00:54:05,972
And therefore, if someone wants to build 18 foot stories for life science, they can, or if they want to build 10 foot stories for residential, they can.

470
00:54:06,373 --> 00:54:10,136
And then we don't have to worry about having two different standards and trying to mix and match them.

471
00:54:11,076 --> 00:54:12,718
I just think that would be the way to go.

472
00:54:12,738 --> 00:54:15,380
I mean, mixed use three, you could end up

473
00:54:17,253 --> 00:54:21,136
I guess you could end up in a situation where a life science developer wants to build a tower.

474
00:54:24,058 --> 00:54:30,363
It seems unlikely to me that a life science developer wants to build a 14 story tower with 18 foot floors all the way up to 14 stories.

475
00:54:30,643 --> 00:54:32,064
Just seems like it's probably not going to happen.

476
00:54:32,084 --> 00:54:39,349
And if it was going to happen, or even if a developer proposed it, the discussion and site plan review would probably be, maybe don't do that.

477
00:54:41,011 --> 00:54:43,192
That's the only place where I think if we were to go with option B,

478
00:54:44,246 --> 00:54:49,390
there would be a conflict, because option B in the dimensional cinders doesn't have a maximum height by feet.

479
00:54:49,410 --> 00:54:52,091
It just has a maximum height by story.

480
00:54:52,111 --> 00:54:58,856
I don't know if that's intentional or unintentional, but if it was intentional, I really liked the idea.

481
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:09,743
I was waiting to hear if there was life science or not in order to calculate that maximum height.

482
00:55:09,964 --> 00:55:10,224
OK.

483
00:55:10,344 --> 00:55:10,784
That's fine.

484
00:55:10,964 --> 00:55:11,224
Got it.

485
00:55:13,715 --> 00:55:31,644
I mean, I have some, the other reason I think perhaps just doing it without having two different height measurements, if you do this right now, if we were to put the height limits from, I guess, like the 12 story, right?

486
00:55:36,046 --> 00:55:37,427
Okay, maybe I'm misreading this.

487
00:55:37,487 --> 00:55:40,588
Would the maximum building height in mixed use three under option A be 54 plus 96?

488
00:55:46,124 --> 00:55:54,952
what would have to be to allow 12 stories if 11 of them were 10 feet tall and the other one was 18, right?

489
00:55:55,272 --> 00:56:00,517
So this is where I think we're gonna start having mathematical conflicts if we have two different measures of maximum height.

490
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:10,320
So yes, it should be podium maximum 54 feet and then the tower itself 96 feet.

491
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:14,224
And then so the total building height would be maximum 150 feet?

492
00:56:14,865 --> 00:56:15,145
Yeah.

493
00:56:15,446 --> 00:56:20,972
Okay, because that's the only way you can get it's 128 feet if you had 12 stories at the minimum floor height.

494
00:56:21,778 --> 00:56:36,012
Yes, so what we have done here is at least put from the maximum height is 12 feet per floor and then you have to sum the first floor as 18 feet.

495
00:56:36,312 --> 00:56:40,035
That's how we said that the minimum ground floor height should be.

496
00:56:40,976 --> 00:56:43,717
And so summing everything, that's what it turns out.

497
00:56:45,778 --> 00:56:49,259
But the maximum height by feet, I'm not so worried now.

498
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:52,280
That's something that we can talk also internally.

499
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:57,182
I also want to know from the city, what are their formulas?

500
00:56:57,722 --> 00:57:00,243
What I'm interested in now is more on the stories.

501
00:57:01,223 --> 00:57:03,284
And that is clear for everyone.

502
00:57:03,649 --> 00:57:15,694
And I think my suggestion for that is have a minimum number of stories, a maximum number of stories, a minimum floor height per story, and a maximum floor height per story.

503
00:57:16,895 --> 00:57:24,138
And then I guess we could also have a maximum building height that is the number of stories times the maximum floor height, but then it's redundant.

504
00:57:24,498 --> 00:57:30,321
So that's just my thinking there to make sure that I understood this exactly right.

505
00:57:31,001 --> 00:57:32,462
But something like that.

506
00:57:33,499 --> 00:57:37,682
At that point, you're just multiplying two numbers that are already in there to get a third number.

507
00:57:37,702 --> 00:57:42,425
And I guess if people feel like that's helpful to have that third number, you can include that too.

508
00:57:42,525 --> 00:57:45,326
But I just wanted to make sure I was reading it right.

509
00:57:45,346 --> 00:57:49,189
Because I was like, if the tower can only be 96 feet, then it can't be 12 stories.

510
00:57:49,329 --> 00:57:50,770
So thanks.

511
00:57:53,511 --> 00:57:53,711
Great.

512
00:57:53,852 --> 00:57:54,172
Thank you.

513
00:57:54,272 --> 00:58:02,457
So there's, I think, to add to the things on the table, there's a suggestion for this more streamlined way of defining

514
00:58:04,062 --> 00:58:11,068
maximum height to allow for that flexibility, especially in, which maybe would most come into play in mixed use four.

515
00:58:12,509 --> 00:58:12,749
Yeah.

516
00:58:12,849 --> 00:58:13,830
Or, uh, yeah.

517
00:58:14,130 --> 00:58:15,832
Mixed use three and commercial.

518
00:58:18,013 --> 00:58:21,416
And I think that might be clear to the developer if they wanted to do life science too.

519
00:58:21,476 --> 00:58:21,696
Right.

520
00:58:21,996 --> 00:58:26,020
It's like, instead of having to go back and calculate, Oh, I can build 18 foot floors.

521
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:28,742
It's like, Oh, the maximum height is what I need.

522
00:58:34,793 --> 00:58:44,357
The other reason to throw the definition of life science in there as a use category and have it in there is it signals to developers, look, it's in our use table.

523
00:58:44,437 --> 00:58:45,497
We thought about it.

524
00:58:45,998 --> 00:58:53,721
It's actively included, as opposed to saying, could you fit it in under R&D, which is honestly what we've been doing the last couple of years.

525
00:58:54,181 --> 00:59:01,304
We've actually gone through the permitting process for some life science buildings that in the end didn't get built because of the timing and the crash.

526
00:59:02,012 --> 00:59:08,136
Um, but we've just been fitting it in under R and D. I definitely want to that death.

527
00:59:09,857 --> 00:59:10,478
Councilor Callahan.

528
00:59:12,159 --> 00:59:14,040
This may not be something you guys can answer.

529
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:22,486
But, um, in terms of like commercial buildings, uh, I know that ever since Covid, there's a lot less need for commercial buildings.

530
00:59:22,526 --> 00:59:29,651
Do we still think that there is enough need that if we zone something that is purely commercial that, um

531
00:59:31,220 --> 00:59:32,202
people going to be developing that.

532
00:59:36,610 --> 00:59:38,674
I mean it's a great question and it's sort of.

533
00:59:39,435 --> 00:59:41,116
what they're looking for.

534
00:59:41,416 --> 00:59:44,817
We're getting more and more clean tech inquiries coming.

535
00:59:45,997 --> 00:59:54,600
The difficulty is sort of fitting this, what I've seen are startup companies that are looking for spaces, not looking to build buildings.

536
00:59:54,960 --> 01:00:01,842
So is there somebody who wants to come and build the building for them to then come and move into is sort of where we're going.

537
01:00:02,202 --> 01:00:07,744
We've recently permitted one on Commercial Street that was originally gonna be a life science building.

538
01:00:08,204 --> 01:00:24,554
And when they, they came in front of us and we said, Oh, we, we thought there was a problem with like science they said oh actually we are, we're pivoting to clean tech, and that Florida floor the 14 feet and I will say we just did the math on the O2 is 14 feet, and I'm sure that's why is.

539
01:00:27,884 --> 01:00:32,025
this would work for clean tech and we want to do this for a clean tech building here.

540
01:00:32,125 --> 01:00:34,326
So I think we are still seeing some of that.

541
01:00:35,727 --> 01:00:37,347
It's not hot the way it was.

542
01:00:37,447 --> 01:00:55,173
We're hoping that with some of the things that have been changing, honestly, for the interest rates to drop and to settle how our country is going to move forward after November, I think will frankly affect the development, whether people are going to risk or not and what they're risking and who's risking.

543
01:00:56,738 --> 01:01:17,213
And just as a follow-up question to that, given the, I guess, ongoing crash in commercial real estate, do we think, in terms of this option A or B, I just wanna get a sense for like,

544
01:01:19,203 --> 01:01:23,445
If we exclude commercial, do we think that we'll be missing out on folks who want to develop here?

545
01:01:23,625 --> 01:01:30,668
If we include commercial, will we be risking having a whole zone that does not have a lot of demand?

546
01:01:30,808 --> 01:01:35,270
Just obviously, you can't fully answer this question, but do you have a sense between those two?

547
01:01:40,433 --> 01:01:46,118
Yes, I think we have an oversimplified understanding of the commercial real estate market in the conversation.

548
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:53,025
Downtown office buildings where foot traffic is significantly reduced are seeing significant reductions in valuation.

549
01:01:53,045 --> 01:01:54,466
I was talking to Ted.

550
01:01:55,087 --> 01:01:57,869
We're not seeing that reduction in valuation in our commercial properties.

551
01:01:58,029 --> 01:01:59,210
Most of them are seeing use.

552
01:01:59,451 --> 01:02:03,795
Some of the office buildings by Wellington are having some occupancy questions.

553
01:02:04,827 --> 01:02:11,789
But I think what we're talking about is a little bit different than like the downtown Boston valuations.

554
01:02:11,849 --> 01:02:24,232
And I don't think Cambridge, like Boston's desperately asking for a property tax class shift because their office buildings are, there's a, there's a ton of new class A offices that were built.

555
01:02:24,853 --> 01:02:29,954
And a lot of the valuation drops are in like a little bit older or significantly older class B office buildings where

556
01:02:30,851 --> 01:02:32,052
Companies don't need as much space.

557
01:02:32,092 --> 01:02:33,372
There's not as much foot traffic.

558
01:02:34,013 --> 01:02:36,394
I think we're not, we don't really have that exposure here.

559
01:02:37,094 --> 01:02:39,515
And I think we're not trying to build office buildings mostly.

560
01:02:39,735 --> 01:02:42,336
So I think we're in a better spot on that front.

561
01:02:44,257 --> 01:02:49,820
You know, Alicia can certainly speak better to and Sal to what's coming into the city, the clean tech.

562
01:02:50,276 --> 01:02:50,996
that kind of thing.

563
01:02:51,857 --> 01:02:53,277
But I think that would be more the direction.

564
01:02:53,957 --> 01:03:05,421
I'd be surprised if someone said, I want to plop an eight foot office bill, you know, a century bank like or Herb Chambers, whatever it is now, like, which is now becoming, leave that for another day.

565
01:03:07,262 --> 01:03:09,943
A building like that, right, where it's just an office tower.

566
01:03:10,703 --> 01:03:19,166
And he's even, Herb Chambers' proposal is to change that because that's not a good use for, even though he likes the property, it's not what he wants it to be or whatever.

567
01:03:21,113 --> 01:03:23,875
So that's where I think we'd probably be okay.

568
01:03:25,116 --> 01:03:26,757
Who knows, who knows what will happen, right?

569
01:03:27,218 --> 01:03:34,103
As Alicia noted, some of this requires having the rule of law, but yeah.

570
01:03:34,484 --> 01:03:36,485
Sal just raised his hand, our economic development director.

571
01:03:36,505 --> 01:03:42,410
Sal is a better answer than me, but I just think we're not nearly as exposed on the commercial front as like a Boston with the office issue.

572
01:03:43,971 --> 01:03:45,192
If I could do with the chair.

573
01:03:45,212 --> 01:03:46,533
Go ahead.

574
01:03:47,898 --> 01:03:48,378
Thank you.

575
01:03:48,679 --> 01:03:53,983
I want to echo the councilor's comments.

576
01:03:54,403 --> 01:04:08,734
So I guess it's, we have to be careful about generalizing commercial real estate demand and looking at the headlines that we see coming out of Boston.

577
01:04:10,455 --> 01:04:12,977
What we're seeing in our department is

578
01:04:14,318 --> 01:04:25,102
a lot of activity, a lot of questions from developers and real estate brokers on what they can do with certain properties on Mystic Ave.

579
01:04:25,602 --> 01:04:27,923
And I think that's a combination of different things.

580
01:04:28,544 --> 01:04:38,447
The opening of Great American Beer Hall has definitely sparked interest from developers looking to do kind of ground floor commercial with residential above.

581
01:04:40,683 --> 01:04:50,788
I attended a ribbon cutting with the mayor and Steve and for a biotech company called Unravel.

582
01:04:51,749 --> 01:04:59,293
And I spoke to, they're in the Tufts Cummings property in 196 Boston Ave.

583
01:05:00,013 --> 01:05:06,777
And I spoke to the CEO and I was asking him point blank, what made you choose this location?

584
01:05:07,917 --> 01:05:12,943
from Boston, and he said one of the things is location.

585
01:05:13,764 --> 01:05:21,273
It's easier for his North Shore employees to get to Medford than it is into the heart of Boston.

586
01:05:22,133 --> 01:05:26,759
Parking availability, which is a lot easier in Medford than it is in Boston.

587
01:05:28,371 --> 01:05:34,835
And he thinks that he's interested in their next kind of expansion.

588
01:05:34,855 --> 01:05:53,268
And I also connected with MassBio to talk about the Anheuser-Busch property as something that will be coming on the market soon, which is 20 acres in the middle of the city to do something interesting.

589
01:05:54,688 --> 01:05:59,291
There when it comes on the market, so I would say that.

590
01:05:59,832 --> 01:06:05,555
Demand is very good, but the 1 thing we need to be careful of and it's why we're doing this zoning.

591
01:06:06,275 --> 01:06:10,458
Is we don't want we don't want to get the uses as Alicia mentioned the 1 or 2 story.

592
01:06:12,219 --> 01:06:18,181
industrial, you know, trucking or automotive service uses.

593
01:06:18,321 --> 01:06:19,721
We have plenty of those already.

594
01:06:21,201 --> 01:06:29,224
We don't want leftovers and scraps from other communities where they're getting priced out and they look at Medford as a last resort.

595
01:06:29,724 --> 01:06:33,805
We want this to align with the vision set out in a comprehensive plan.

596
01:06:33,905 --> 01:06:37,046
So thank you for allowing me to speak.

597
01:06:37,066 --> 01:06:37,966
I'll stop here.

598
01:06:39,721 --> 01:06:51,342
Thank you, so I really appreciate that and I think that was I think that was really well said and echoes you know kind of a lot of our goals with how to make sure that we are enticing the development that we really want and need to be seeing.

599
01:06:51,820 --> 01:06:52,720
here specifically.

600
01:06:52,740 --> 01:06:58,123
I think that general point of discussion is a really important one.

601
01:06:58,803 --> 01:07:09,827
For me, it further endears me to option B because I think it's extremely worth considering how much kind of zoned for commercial, telegraphing commercial is enough or too much.

602
01:07:13,469 --> 01:07:18,751
And this is already kind of further cordoning off that commercial specific to just the south side of Mystic.

603
01:07:18,811 --> 01:07:20,852
I wouldn't be a proponent necessarily of having

604
01:07:22,051 --> 01:07:24,072
no commercial zoning necessarily.

605
01:07:24,112 --> 01:07:48,526
I don't think that we need to go that far, but I feel comfortable, especially if we're, you know, amending this proposal such that it's kind of more clear where life science fits in and making it more flexible to include life science and research, putting that commercial zone how it currently is in option B, but with the carve out for perhaps

606
01:07:49,301 --> 01:07:54,545
mixed-use one along the park school housing area along Hicks Avenue.

607
01:07:59,288 --> 01:08:08,615
In terms of what we have, just to quickly gloss over, not comprehensively, what we've spoken about so far and some of the ideas that have been put on the table.

608
01:08:10,752 --> 01:08:11,333
counselors.

609
01:08:12,974 --> 01:08:17,938
We know that we want to see this amended to include a definition of life sciences in the use table.

610
01:08:17,958 --> 01:08:25,925
I think we want to see that alternate way of defining maximum height for mixed-use 3 and commercial to allow that flexibility.

611
01:08:27,666 --> 01:08:35,393
It sounds like there's a lot of interest in seeing that carve out for mixed-use 1 along HCSAV and commercial like we were just talking about.

612
01:08:37,682 --> 01:08:52,416
And then I think we're going to come back to President Beers' suggestion about potentially, for the purposes of this proposal, just moving forward the highlighted parcels within the potential parcels for inclusion around Harvard, Alexander, and Bonner.

613
01:08:53,517 --> 01:08:56,180
Just to, yeah, great.

614
01:08:58,503 --> 01:08:58,723
Great.

615
01:08:59,424 --> 01:09:05,267
So just to, I just want to recenter us on kind of the questions that we need to make sure we answer tonight to move this forward.

616
01:09:05,307 --> 01:09:16,694
It sounds like we're approaching consensus on what we want to motion out as next steps for our zoning consultant in terms of land uses and proposed added parcels that we haven't taken motions on any of that yet.

617
01:09:17,114 --> 01:09:20,456
We haven't spoken as much about, we've touched on the setbacks issue.

618
01:09:20,476 --> 01:09:21,756
We haven't spoken as much about that.

619
01:09:21,796 --> 01:09:28,020
So I want to make sure if there's a discussion to be had about how we handle that issue, I want to make sure we spend some time on that.

620
01:09:30,865 --> 01:09:31,486
Go for it.

621
01:09:31,506 --> 01:09:52,887
So one thing that I just wanted to be clear about is, and I feel like I get confused myself when we refer to it as option A and option B too much, whether we are, there's a consensus on whether there should be a portion of this that does not allow residential in it, or residential is allowed everywhere.

622
01:09:53,687 --> 01:10:11,653
And if there are portions that allow auto uses, and there's a part of me that thinks we might want to allow gas stations as a by special permit, just so that there can be some amount of, you know, distribution around the city, and whether we're allowing.

623
01:10:12,874 --> 01:10:30,861
R&D, life science, light industrial in summer, all of this, and how much of that is actually lining up the use tables and doing checkboxes versus us looking at it in this map format and saying that.

624
01:10:31,081 --> 01:10:36,863
Because I'm not sure that I know the answer of the wills of the, what the preferences of the council.

625
01:10:38,714 --> 01:10:40,035
I can kind of go a different way.

626
01:10:40,316 --> 01:10:43,057
I can hear arguments on all the sides for all of those.

627
01:10:43,118 --> 01:10:46,780
So thank you for that.

628
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:53,965
Uh, counselor, let me, sorry, just a real, um, personal idiot check question on my part here.

629
01:10:54,005 --> 01:10:56,827
So, I mean, with option with option,

630
01:10:57,970 --> 01:11:08,917
be like, we would need incentive zoning, correct, to implement the other programs that we're talking about as part of our, as part of the zoning overhaul.

631
01:11:08,977 --> 01:11:25,848
So, like, would, like, we would need this in, we would need kind of those incentives to build higher for, like, for implementing, like, a TDM program, for instance, or some kind of, some kind of green incentives.

632
01:11:26,208 --> 01:11:26,548
Is that,

633
01:11:27,470 --> 01:11:30,282
And so if we go with option A, that's just all out.

634
01:11:30,382 --> 01:11:31,246
Is that no?

635
01:11:32,939 --> 01:11:33,139
No.

636
01:11:33,199 --> 01:11:41,345
So the incentive zoning, because it's very difficult, I don't want to have the option A or B and then you vote on that.

637
01:11:42,046 --> 01:11:44,567
But I needed to put more variables on it.

638
01:11:45,048 --> 01:11:56,156
And so incentive zoning is just one extra variable that can be applied to A or B. So it's not only dependent on the option, it can be applied to any option that we want.

639
01:11:56,696 --> 01:12:01,179
And that will be another voting that we will do just next from the land use.

640
01:12:02,970 --> 01:12:06,291
would be the, do we want incentive zoning or not?

641
01:12:06,931 --> 01:12:08,671
So it's not related to the options.

642
01:12:10,052 --> 01:12:12,812
Well, on the next slide that we were just looking at.

643
01:12:18,134 --> 01:12:25,955
This is just, it says incentive zoning option A or B. And so it's A, no incentive zoning, B, with incentive zoning.

644
01:12:30,981 --> 01:12:32,061
within sentence, all right, yeah.

645
01:12:32,741 --> 01:12:35,562
Oh, A and B are confusing there.

646
01:12:35,642 --> 01:12:37,022
We should have used one or two.

647
01:12:37,503 --> 01:12:46,565
Yeah, I just didn't want it to, there are a lot of variables and yeah, maybe that's, I should have taken out all the colors.

648
01:12:46,925 --> 01:12:52,586
Listen, I'm a very simple person, you gotta.

649
01:12:53,807 --> 01:12:55,927
Yeah, I like it, I like it when things are.

650
01:12:55,947 --> 01:12:59,208
I like it when the code puts the correct answer.

651
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:14,646
I was just going to say that my motion will be to adopt the option B, which is the mixed use three along the entire highway side and the commercial on the non-highway side with the incentive zoning.

652
01:13:14,666 --> 01:13:15,786
That's my suggestion.

653
01:13:15,946 --> 01:13:20,549
And life science is also in mixed use three?

654
01:13:20,969 --> 01:13:21,269
Yes.

655
01:13:22,249 --> 01:13:23,710
Not in mixed use two or one?

656
01:13:24,310 --> 01:13:26,732
Well, that's, I was just going to say, add it to the use table.

657
01:13:27,592 --> 01:13:28,432
Is it right now?

658
01:13:28,512 --> 01:13:29,513
Is it in two or one?

659
01:13:31,350 --> 01:13:37,154
What I have thought is more of this larger scale would be going to mix three and mix four.

660
01:13:37,795 --> 01:13:41,698
So for me, life science was more on those areas.

661
01:13:42,239 --> 01:13:50,465
And the mix use one and two is more like neighborhood kind of like... Yeah, what does the R&D use line say right now in the proposed use table?

662
01:13:50,485 --> 01:13:52,707
I didn't see the proposed use table.

663
01:13:52,907 --> 01:13:53,808
You didn't send it to us.

664
01:13:53,988 --> 01:13:54,408
Yeah.

665
01:13:54,729 --> 01:13:56,270
The only thing I saw was the cover sheet.

666
01:13:56,290 --> 01:13:58,212
Oh, if you click it, it opens it up.

667
01:14:17,281 --> 01:14:20,443
Would it be possible for you to screen share that, Paola, the table of uses?

668
01:14:20,483 --> 01:14:21,744
Oh, it's not letting me open it either.

669
01:14:21,764 --> 01:14:22,685
I wasn't able to open it.

670
01:14:25,587 --> 01:14:27,549
So I took the existing table of uses.

671
01:14:27,609 --> 01:14:29,511
I'm not sure if it's there or not.

672
01:14:34,114 --> 01:14:41,079
I was hoping to get to that at the end, but we can... I think it's useful now.

673
01:14:41,380 --> 01:14:45,483
The setbacks question will probably iron itself out relatively quickly, I think.

674
01:14:52,872 --> 01:14:56,295
It's the September 18th email.

675
01:14:56,375 --> 01:14:56,976
Is that one?

676
01:15:41,735 --> 01:15:46,036
When I try to do that, it says can't access the file.

677
01:16:00,779 --> 01:16:03,200
Either way, I think I still have the floor.

678
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:07,841
My point was generally being that

679
01:16:09,815 --> 01:16:12,098
I agree with including life science as a separate definition.

680
01:16:12,118 --> 01:16:16,863
I just think we need to make sure that it's allowed in the same places that R&D is allowed.

681
01:16:16,883 --> 01:16:22,769
And if we think that MX3 and commercial makes the most sense for that, that makes sense to me.

682
01:16:39,381 --> 01:16:41,982
Oh, yeah, this was in the document that was attached to the agenda.

683
01:16:42,002 --> 01:16:48,884
I was like, where is it?

684
01:16:48,964 --> 01:16:50,265
And that's the page I have open.

685
01:16:50,845 --> 01:16:51,525
Thank you, Paola.

686
01:16:53,186 --> 01:16:56,167
Sorry, those of us behind the rail, myself included, struggled to find that.

687
01:17:08,484 --> 01:17:35,585
So I think I just want to get, with this, I just want to get clarity on if we should be taking care in the finalized proposal to be seeing life science included in the table of definitions and also added as allowed uses to mixed use three and four, or if it's already... Right now, manufacturing and research and testing are no, no, no, yes, or special permit.

688
01:17:37,921 --> 01:17:39,841
So I think we just want to make sure we align those.

689
01:17:48,344 --> 01:17:55,265
Would Alicia, sorry, would Green Tech fall, like let's say they want to build Green Tech, is that manufacturing?

690
01:17:58,006 --> 01:18:01,447
Are you talking about a particular company or in theory Green Tech?

691
01:18:01,507 --> 01:18:02,847
If some Green Tech company wanted to

692
01:18:04,003 --> 01:18:07,905
So it's this idea, if they want to make the product, it's manufacturing.

693
01:18:08,345 --> 01:18:08,645
Okay.

694
01:18:08,825 --> 01:18:12,406
And that's why we might talk about light manufacturing versus manufacturing.

695
01:18:12,426 --> 01:18:14,967
And we may need some definitions of manufacturing.

696
01:18:14,987 --> 01:18:20,329
Like if they're making the product, there is an in between place that we have called R&D.

697
01:18:21,569 --> 01:18:25,831
We have like the actually the former building commissioner classified it as R&D.

698
01:18:26,755 --> 01:18:41,353
When the proposal was life sciences like to do iterations and so they'll produce a small batch of something, and then they'll work with it some more or maybe use that for testing right you know you put your.

699
01:18:42,472 --> 01:18:50,379
doing, you need enough to do a test group, right, while you're in R&D, clinical tests, sorry, thank you.

700
01:18:50,620 --> 01:18:53,963
When you're in clinical trials, you need to produce enough, but not a lot.

701
01:18:54,923 --> 01:18:59,287
And so we actually classified that under R&D, research and testing.

702
01:19:00,609 --> 01:19:06,194
But we may want to go ahead and get a bunch of definitions that are a little bit more clear.

703
01:19:06,769 --> 01:19:11,710
that that sort of small-scale manufacturing, we've permitted two of those.

704
01:19:11,750 --> 01:19:16,171
That's that new life, the new building I just talked about that is gonna go clean tech.

705
01:19:16,691 --> 01:19:18,491
They also do prototyping like that.

706
01:19:19,191 --> 01:19:20,292
Is that on Commercial Street?

707
01:19:20,852 --> 01:19:22,112
It's the one on Commercial Street.

708
01:19:22,692 --> 01:19:29,813
And then the one straight back from there, I wanna call it Sydney Street, but I think- Sycamore.

709
01:19:30,013 --> 01:19:30,473
Sycamore.

710
01:19:30,933 --> 01:19:33,574
That one was for specifically biotech.

711
01:19:34,062 --> 01:19:39,425
to do like small scale manufacture, do some more testing and then iterate.

712
01:19:40,785 --> 01:19:41,005
Great.

713
01:19:41,546 --> 01:19:43,607
I think I got it down.

714
01:19:44,027 --> 01:19:44,247
Great.

715
01:19:46,988 --> 01:19:47,468
Thank you all.

716
01:19:48,229 --> 01:19:53,371
Um, it sounds like we're getting close to being able to make some motions.

717
01:19:54,012 --> 01:19:56,833
I think the setbacks issue can we can we skim over that?

718
01:19:56,893 --> 01:19:58,674
It sounds like that's pretty close to dispensed with.

719
01:19:59,354 --> 01:20:01,015
Are there questions from counselors on how to

720
01:20:02,886 --> 01:20:10,683
Or Pella, is there a similar kind of like options that you're presenting to us when it comes to the treatment of setbacks in the various land uses along Mystic or?

721
01:20:15,147 --> 01:20:26,954
So the idea of the uses was to have as the smaller type of scale to be for mixed use one and two and then the bigger type of scale.

722
01:20:27,074 --> 01:20:33,438
So if there is like hotel small can be mixed one and two but larger can be more in mixed three.

723
01:20:34,458 --> 01:20:35,880
or for or commercial.

724
01:20:36,921 --> 01:20:44,068
For example, for life science at the moment, we had it in mix for and commercial.

725
01:20:44,449 --> 01:20:45,430
Oh, sorry, I was talking.

726
01:20:46,411 --> 01:20:48,413
Sorry, I might have misphrased my question.

727
01:20:48,433 --> 01:20:49,915
I was talking about setbacks specifically.

728
01:20:49,935 --> 01:20:51,056
Oh, sorry.

729
01:20:51,376 --> 01:20:52,277
The Yes.

730
01:20:53,498 --> 01:20:53,939
One second.

731
01:20:58,112 --> 01:21:07,735
So the setbacks, what I need is to talk first about the sections of the street that we have, because we have some issues.

732
01:21:09,175 --> 01:21:13,697
The street has two different ownerships.

733
01:21:14,297 --> 01:21:16,658
And so there are some complications over there.

734
01:21:17,178 --> 01:21:21,699
So I wanted to, I need to go through the presentation first before explaining the setbacks.

735
01:21:22,539 --> 01:21:24,680
So do we go to that part?

736
01:21:26,894 --> 01:21:28,416
Yeah, I think we can do that really quickly.

737
01:21:28,436 --> 01:21:31,339
Can we skim through the issue of the presentation on the setbacks?

738
01:21:31,419 --> 01:21:47,916
It sounded like there was kind of a... Yeah, if we could just get to the nugget of what the difference like, what do we, what's the difference between doing the street setback and the other?

739
01:21:48,636 --> 01:21:49,357
I'm still not sure.

740
01:21:49,778 --> 01:21:50,478
I don't phrase it.

741
01:21:50,699 --> 01:22:04,827
Yeah, I think, I think, since the presentation was circulated ahead of time, if it's possible, Paola, to just kind of give us the comparison on what's, what's the difference between the two options for property owners, what's the difference in streetscape, and what is your recommendation?

742
01:22:04,847 --> 01:22:06,108
Yeah, pros and cons.

743
01:22:07,521 --> 01:22:12,583
So the thing is that Mystic Avenue in this sense is quite complex.

744
01:22:13,523 --> 01:22:21,365
And we are still talking to the DPO, sorry, the public work department.

745
01:22:23,166 --> 01:22:27,309
the engineers from the city because it's not very easy to solve.

746
01:22:28,009 --> 01:22:32,292
And so we have proposals, but we still need to see that these are possible.

747
01:22:32,893 --> 01:22:51,346
So what I wanted to explain very quickly is that Mystic Avenue is divided from this point, that is Hancock Street, we have towards the south, towards Somerville, is MassDOT ownership, and the northern part until Main Street, that's Medford.

748
01:22:53,574 --> 01:22:54,644
There is some kind of.

749
01:22:55,575 --> 01:23:07,344
from MassDOT, so the part that belongs to MassDOT is quite wide regarding to the sidewalks, while the Medford part, it's really not enough.

750
01:23:08,204 --> 01:23:24,937
And so we need to think in some strategies on how that can help us to build a proper sidewalk so that it will become an active, vibrant, interesting for pedestrians type of a street.

751
01:23:26,465 --> 01:23:28,407
And so this is the situation that we have now.

752
01:23:28,567 --> 01:23:30,930
And this is the area that we have.

753
01:23:31,070 --> 01:23:36,516
And this is from 5.5 feet to usually around 8.

754
01:23:38,018 --> 01:23:41,222
Some places are 10 feet wide.

755
01:23:41,822 --> 01:23:45,306
It's not very wide because they also have all the

756
01:23:47,328 --> 01:23:52,772
kind of infrastructure, street furniture, signs, poles in this area.

757
01:23:53,852 --> 01:23:56,254
So there is no space available.

758
01:23:57,415 --> 01:23:58,516
This is the other side.

759
01:23:58,636 --> 01:24:01,218
So this is the mass DOT area.

760
01:24:01,658 --> 01:24:07,882
And at least the property lines are quite offset from the curb line.

761
01:24:08,022 --> 01:24:13,847
From the curb towards the property line, the mass DOT, we have at least 15 feet

762
01:24:16,008 --> 01:24:20,611
offset that we do not have in the first part.

763
01:24:22,212 --> 01:24:24,253
So that's where it becomes a bit complex.

764
01:24:25,153 --> 01:24:31,557
What we need, and at least from NACTO and that is the national, sorry I have it somewhere,

765
01:24:34,645 --> 01:24:53,879
The National Association of City Transportation official, and this is one, but there is this type of dimensions comes from many, many studies, is at least to have a curb zone where it's a street furniture green zone that is more dynamic.

766
01:24:55,540 --> 01:24:58,722
That goes from five, six foot minimum.

767
01:24:59,323 --> 01:25:03,386
Then to have exclusive pedestrian zone, and that is from eight foot

768
01:25:03,846 --> 01:25:04,086
to 12.

769
01:25:05,748 --> 01:25:12,975
And then there is the area where the building and the private property relates with the street and that's what they call frontage.

770
01:25:14,236 --> 01:25:21,359
Um, what we have now is that the situation on and this is only for Medford portion of mystic.

771
01:25:22,059 --> 01:25:26,601
We have mainly, uh, towards where you see the property line.

772
01:25:27,462 --> 01:25:36,506
And so we have very, very little area to really, uh, ensure and have a good, um, corridor and sidewalk.

773
01:25:38,146 --> 01:25:54,732
So what we are thinking, and we hope that is possible, and this is something that we want Jonathan also to help us, how to do this, that it's not taking advantage of anyone and that everyone is happy with this situation.

774
01:25:55,993 --> 01:25:58,334
We try to do some kind of a street setback.

775
01:25:58,834 --> 01:26:00,775
And this is taken from the curb line.

776
01:26:01,815 --> 01:26:03,055
And that's what we see here.

777
01:26:03,356 --> 01:26:10,258
That is the area that connects the external part of the sidewalk with the road, with the road lane.

778
01:26:11,858 --> 01:26:18,361
Having a setback of at least 15, that will be the minimum.

779
01:26:19,261 --> 01:26:21,662
And that will go over the property line.

780
01:26:22,282 --> 01:26:26,844
So that you see this bluish hatch.

781
01:26:28,324 --> 01:26:35,708
that should be used, that we want to use for the public, even though it's part of the property lot.

782
01:26:37,789 --> 01:26:44,513
And then from there we have the front setback, that it can be quite minimum, it can be around three.

783
01:26:46,720 --> 01:26:49,022
What do you see on the left is what we have right now.

784
01:26:49,102 --> 01:26:54,986
So we have a curb line, then we have a sidewalk of at least eight in the better cases.

785
01:26:55,046 --> 01:26:56,167
We have a property line.

786
01:26:56,667 --> 01:27:00,890
And then what they demand at this moment is this 15 feet setback.

787
01:27:01,530 --> 01:27:06,834
So we are not taking a lot of the space for building that will be even less what we require.

788
01:27:07,714 --> 01:27:15,760
So in that sense for where they can build, we are not messing with that, at least with referring to the current that they have.

789
01:27:16,780 --> 01:27:26,448
So we need to stipulate how can we work, if it's by easement, if it's by building setback.

790
01:27:26,648 --> 01:27:34,054
We don't know still how to build this, but to be able to at least have a minimum of eight foot setback.

791
01:27:36,656 --> 01:27:41,139
So what we had here, it was proposing option A,

792
01:27:42,818 --> 01:27:46,841
15 foot of a street setback, and then the building setback.

793
01:27:47,242 --> 01:28:03,875
And that means that we would go on the image that we see below this option A, you see a smaller orange line, which is we take less from the property line towards the public.

794
01:28:05,439 --> 01:28:12,884
Meanwhile, we can also say, well, let's do as much as we can as a street setback.

795
01:28:13,405 --> 01:28:15,686
And we don't require building setbacks.

796
01:28:16,427 --> 01:28:20,250
And so at the end, for the building purpose is the same.

797
01:28:20,590 --> 01:28:21,370
It doesn't change.

798
01:28:21,871 --> 01:28:23,472
It's just how we do it.

799
01:28:25,919 --> 01:28:26,460
technically.

800
01:28:27,420 --> 01:28:51,945
So for us, the best way to do it, because of what we are seeing that is happening in MassDOT portion of the Mystic Avenue, we think the best is to go with option A. So that will be my recommendation, to try to have a street setback of at least 15 feet, and then a building setback of three feet.

801
01:28:54,654 --> 01:29:01,296
It's complex, so sorry if I cannot, but let's hope that you understood me.

802
01:29:02,716 --> 01:29:06,238
Go ahead.

803
01:29:06,258 --> 01:29:07,798
This is just for the Medford section.

804
01:29:08,378 --> 01:29:08,618
Yes.

805
01:29:08,878 --> 01:29:13,760
We don't need to do this in the MassDOT section, we're pretty sure, because the setbacks are basically already wide.

806
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:17,901
The property line is already quite offset, and we have a space for sidewalk.

807
01:29:18,260 --> 01:29:27,310
Okay, and that's more like we're going to have to negotiate with MassDOT to have it be something more active than bushes and grass, but that's a MassDOT question, not a property owner question.

808
01:29:27,390 --> 01:29:27,590
Yes.

809
01:29:28,150 --> 01:29:28,431
Okay.

810
01:29:30,753 --> 01:29:40,704
And are the difference between these two options that one may be more legal than the other to ask of the property owners?

811
01:29:41,696 --> 01:29:48,218
Once we ask the street setback, I think it doesn't matter how much we do in legal terms.

812
01:29:48,278 --> 01:29:49,218
We need to figure it out.

813
01:29:49,358 --> 01:29:53,339
But once we figure it out, if we can do this, it doesn't matter which option.

814
01:29:53,940 --> 01:30:01,882
The thing is, do we have to do this with only building setbacks or so we require a longer building setback and we say that it has to be

815
01:30:03,183 --> 01:30:09,090
Also used by public, I don't know if that is possible so that is a Jonathan question that I would like to explore with him.

816
01:30:09,711 --> 01:30:14,916
I also want to talk again with the engineers to see what they think is possible and not.

817
01:30:17,439 --> 01:30:35,383
And I think that the best that we can do is to have the first one also because it gives us the continuity with the other portion, because then we also have these, let's say that this 15 feet is continuous all over, because that's also what they have in the MassDOT portion.

818
01:30:35,863 --> 01:30:43,625
And then we control the relation between the building and the street with this minimum setback of three feet.

819
01:30:44,325 --> 01:30:52,870
So that's why I also think that the first one can give us more continuity and a bit more flexibility with the two portions of Mystic Avenue.

820
01:30:53,490 --> 01:30:53,751
Okay.

821
01:30:54,411 --> 01:30:55,171
Can I jump in here?

822
01:30:55,191 --> 01:30:56,072
Yeah.

823
01:30:56,172 --> 01:31:00,214
I think I keep missing the second half of each of these options that we're setting up.

824
01:31:03,256 --> 01:31:09,980
With option A, is it the case that we have this 15 feet of curb and then we also get

825
01:31:12,039 --> 01:31:20,672
Do we have 15 feet of sidewalk in any case under this proposal, and then we maybe get three feet more depending on the negotiation with the property owner?

826
01:31:21,693 --> 01:31:23,716
I'm confused about what the difference is between these two.

827
01:31:23,756 --> 01:31:26,120
Could you make it even simpler than you're already doing?

828
01:31:27,081 --> 01:31:35,368
No, it's really not a lot of difference because the amount of space that I'm requiring is exactly the same for both.

829
01:31:36,008 --> 01:31:37,670
It's just about how we do it.

830
01:31:37,850 --> 01:31:45,876
So if we give a bit more flexibility, having a building setback plus a street setback, or if we only ask for a street setback.

831
01:31:46,377 --> 01:31:54,624
Is the difference in what we are asking of the property owners and how that setback curb zone is designated, like this is your building setback versus

832
01:31:55,097 --> 01:31:59,762
this is your property but you're designating it as an active pedestrian zone and just like how we're referring to it.

833
01:32:00,463 --> 01:32:16,261
So the building setback is mainly that it's still on their jurisdiction and they can do whatever they want with it with certain development standards, but mainly it's still, it's not, they don't have to do any easement or they don't have to give it back to

834
01:32:17,225 --> 01:32:21,547
in some way have give permission to the city to use it.

835
01:32:22,108 --> 01:32:24,209
The building setback, it's something different.

836
01:32:24,229 --> 01:32:26,670
So that's why in the option A, I divided.

837
01:32:27,150 --> 01:32:31,052
So that is not so abrupt for the owners.

838
01:32:31,813 --> 01:32:32,073
I see.

839
01:32:32,233 --> 01:32:39,657
I mean, if option A is more, it sounds like you think it'd be more streamlined, which I'm always

840
01:32:40,742 --> 01:32:41,462
persuaded by.

841
01:32:41,902 --> 01:32:49,484
And this is still something that we are still doing some research and we need to see how this can be really done.

842
01:32:49,504 --> 01:33:00,767
Are there further questions or comments from councillors on these kind of, it strikes me that the

843
01:33:01,479 --> 01:33:16,749
The resident experience for people walking down the sidewalk will not be much changed from option A versus option B. As one counselor, I'd be comfortable with moving forward with trying to see if we can make option A happen pending Paula's future research.

844
01:33:18,450 --> 01:33:26,115
And then we can, you know, over the next, I guess that'd be two or three weeks, and then see what's possible for the final package on the 23rd.

845
01:33:26,976 --> 01:33:29,418
Are there additional questions or comments on this from counselors?

846
01:33:29,978 --> 01:33:30,919
Or do we feel comfortable with

847
01:33:31,957 --> 01:33:34,739
putting that pin in it, seeing some thumbs up.

848
01:33:35,439 --> 01:33:37,080
Great, thank you for that explanation.

849
01:33:40,162 --> 01:33:45,725
So we have some resolution on the question of setbacks.

850
01:33:45,865 --> 01:33:58,773
I know President Bairds is working on a motion on land use, and then it sounded like there wasn't a lot of quarrel with the idea of for the proposal coming to us in a month, including just the highlighted parcels.

851
01:33:59,474 --> 01:34:11,382
inside those proposed additional parcels being added to the Mystic Ave corridor area, which satisfies my list of three questions that we absolutely had to speak to tonight.

852
01:34:11,863 --> 01:34:12,363
Paola, go ahead.

853
01:34:14,949 --> 01:34:36,487
Yes, I also had these ideas for the frontage, and this is what I told Councillor Behrs, that what we want is to really achieve very, very active frontages, so front yards, and so the elements that we will

854
01:34:38,629 --> 01:34:54,702
to have on the front yard are going to be mainly if they create active use, if they are helping towards stormwater and active mobility, like bike parking, for example.

855
01:34:55,963 --> 01:35:01,708
So this is what we want in case they want to have a bigger front setback.

856
01:35:02,128 --> 01:35:04,270
These are the elements that they need to include.

857
01:35:04,910 --> 01:35:18,160
Otherwise, their setback has to be the minimum of whatever we require zero or three, depending on this on this later conversation.

858
01:35:19,401 --> 01:35:19,662
Great.

859
01:35:20,602 --> 01:35:21,403
Thank you so much for that.

860
01:35:26,046 --> 01:35:29,109
Great, thank you for that substantive overview of a lot of what's before us for

861
01:35:29,878 --> 01:35:30,778
in the Stick Up corridor.

862
01:35:30,818 --> 01:35:31,659
This is really exciting.

863
01:35:31,679 --> 01:35:34,280
I know there were some motions in the works.

864
01:35:34,360 --> 01:35:36,341
I can't make motions from the chair.

865
01:35:38,562 --> 01:35:42,244
Any further questions, comments from councilors?

866
01:35:42,264 --> 01:35:45,285
I'm also happy to go to public participation while folks are thinking.

867
01:35:45,625 --> 01:35:46,125
Could you do that?

868
01:35:46,626 --> 01:35:47,586
And then I'll do the motions.

869
01:35:47,886 --> 01:35:48,106
Great.

870
01:35:52,008 --> 01:35:55,050
I'll open it up for public participation on this topic.

871
01:35:56,030 --> 01:35:57,951
If you're in person, you may approach the podium.

872
01:35:58,683 --> 01:36:04,786
I will recognize you if you're on Zoom, please click the raise hand button and I will recognize and unmute you.

873
01:36:06,386 --> 01:36:11,228
For public participation, everyone who wishes to speak has three minutes to speak their mind on this topic.

874
01:36:15,150 --> 01:36:19,812
Not seeing any hands raised, I'll give it a second for folks to find the button if they're looking.

875
01:36:25,314 --> 01:36:26,895
While I'm vamping, I'll just note that

876
01:36:28,010 --> 01:36:39,880
As Paola mentioned at the beginning of the meeting, our planned agenda for our next committee meeting, which is October 8th.

877
01:36:39,900 --> 01:36:48,487
So Innis Associates will be working on finalizing what comes out of this meeting into a final proposal for us to review on Mystic App Corridor.

878
01:36:48,547 --> 01:36:55,773
So at our next meeting on October 9th, I think our plan is again to revisit the topic of green score.

879
01:36:56,431 --> 01:37:01,293
which we touched on, I think it was two meetings ago now, or maybe just one, as well as our housing definitions.

880
01:37:03,294 --> 01:37:20,881
And I will make sure that all the documents that this committee received or looked at in committee around those two topics are recirculated to counselors ahead of time so that we can come in ready to make some decisions and ask some really good questions around green score and housing and get those

881
01:37:21,881 --> 01:37:33,469
Moving along as well, so that green score, the housing definitions, and the Mystic Avenue zoning proposal can all be reported out as a package on October 23rd, if we should move that way.

882
01:37:38,793 --> 01:37:40,134
I misspoke, it's just October 9th.

883
01:37:45,237 --> 01:37:46,838
Sorry, what's October 9th is?

884
01:37:47,018 --> 01:37:48,920
Green score and- And housing definitions.

885
01:37:49,160 --> 01:37:49,340
Great.

886
01:37:51,744 --> 01:37:53,945
And we are hoping to have a finalized proposal.

887
01:37:53,985 --> 01:38:02,629
We are planning to have a finalized green score proposal to potentially report out on October 23 at the same time as Mystic Avenue zoning.

888
01:38:03,250 --> 01:38:03,430
Great.

889
01:38:03,450 --> 01:38:05,231
All right.

890
01:38:05,331 --> 01:38:06,311
I have the motion.

891
01:38:06,851 --> 01:38:08,532
Great.

892
01:38:09,793 --> 01:38:11,073
It's six bullet points.

893
01:38:11,113 --> 01:38:12,294
I'll just send it now.

894
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:17,460
guys.

895
01:38:19,001 --> 01:38:20,302
Um I'll read it.

896
01:38:20,903 --> 01:38:21,703
It is.

897
01:38:23,864 --> 01:38:30,789
Promotion to move forward with drafting based on land East option be with incentive zoning.

898
01:38:30,809 --> 01:38:35,812
Um adjust the discussed parcels on the southwest end of Hicks

899
01:38:42,884 --> 01:39:00,595
Motion to add life science to use table and align slash update definitions of research and testing laboratory manufacturing and the scientific research accessory use and allow them either by right or special permit and the proposed mixed use three and commercial districts.

900
01:39:03,298 --> 01:39:13,105
I do not add the parcels to these zones that do not have Mystic Ave frontage between Bonner Ave, Alexander Ave, and Crescent Street, Malvern Terrace, Hancock Court.

901
01:39:13,726 --> 01:39:24,034
So that would be like that inner portion, the kind of L-shaped one, as well as the stuff right behind the Harrow's Chicken Pie and the Dunkin' Donuts.

902
01:39:25,908 --> 01:39:34,521
And finally move ahead with assessing the viability of street setback option A, the 15 feet plus three foot building setback and incorporating that into the final language.

903
01:39:36,203 --> 01:39:36,484
Thank you.

904
01:39:37,705 --> 01:39:39,328
I see a second from Councilor Callahan.

905
01:39:45,717 --> 01:39:51,440
incentive zoning not being in that one section, but I assume that everything else would have incentive zoning.

906
01:39:51,480 --> 01:39:51,680
Yes.

907
01:39:51,720 --> 01:39:51,900
Yeah.

908
01:39:51,960 --> 01:39:59,543
Just the no incentive zoning at the, just that little HICSAB mixed use one kind of, I don't know if we want to call it that.

909
01:40:00,244 --> 01:40:02,445
And also behind, like, yeah, the HICSAB one, right?

910
01:40:02,485 --> 01:40:02,905
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

911
01:40:02,985 --> 01:40:04,926
Just that, that's, exactly.

912
01:40:05,146 --> 01:40:05,326
Yeah.

913
01:40:05,886 --> 01:40:06,106
Great.

914
01:40:06,186 --> 01:40:06,546
Thank you.

915
01:40:06,566 --> 01:40:07,207
It does have.

916
01:40:07,427 --> 01:40:07,727
Yes.

917
01:40:07,807 --> 01:40:08,027
Yeah.

918
01:40:08,687 --> 01:40:08,887
Great.

919
01:40:08,927 --> 01:40:10,148
Thank you so much for the clarification.

920
01:40:10,288 --> 01:40:10,468
All right.

921
01:40:10,488 --> 01:40:14,470
So that's a second from Councilor Callahan on President Burris' motion.

922
01:40:17,126 --> 01:40:21,248
We're not hybrid tonight, so unless anyone requests a roll call vote, all those in favor?

923
01:40:21,268 --> 01:40:22,109
Aye.

924
01:40:22,369 --> 01:40:22,889
All opposed?

925
01:40:23,769 --> 01:40:24,390
Motion passes.

926
01:40:27,011 --> 01:40:27,231
Great.

927
01:40:27,351 --> 01:40:35,996
Well, I'm really excited to leave this meeting with a clear set of next steps on zoning for the Mystic Ave corridor.

928
01:40:36,116 --> 01:40:39,998
Really excited to review that final proposal ahead of our committee meeting on the 23rd.

929
01:40:40,578 --> 01:40:41,979
Really excited to move forward

930
01:40:43,018 --> 01:40:48,382
a more specific plan for green score as well as shoring up our housing definitions on October 9th.

931
01:40:48,962 --> 01:40:55,907
Like I said, I'll make sure that all of our documents around green score and housing definitions are forwarded to counselors ahead of time so we can review and come prepared.

932
01:40:55,927 --> 01:41:02,352
I just want to thank Paola and Jimmy from Innis Associates so much for your hard work in helping us get to this point.

933
01:41:02,372 --> 01:41:11,739
This is the culmination of not just nine months of work on zoning in this committee, but also incorporating many, many years of community outreach and planning as a community-wide process.

934
01:41:12,605 --> 01:41:19,048
Thank you for going through that with us, and thank you, of course, Director Hunt and Planner Evans for shepherding us through this work.

935
01:41:21,169 --> 01:41:22,850
Any final comments from councilors?

936
01:41:23,591 --> 01:41:24,091
Do I have a motion?

937
01:41:26,812 --> 01:41:28,493
Motion to adjourn, seconded by Councilor Lemming.

938
01:41:28,513 --> 01:41:29,133
All those in favor?

939
01:41:30,474 --> 01:41:30,974
All opposed?

940
01:41:31,595 --> 01:41:32,155
Meeting is adjourned.
