1
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:22,925
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going to test out the presentation real quick.

2
00:07:17,049 --> 00:07:17,569
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, Scott.

3
00:07:21,431 --> 00:07:21,551
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello.

4
00:08:33,355 --> 00:08:34,315
[SPEAKER_06]: Scott, can you hear me?

5
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:35,916
[SPEAKER_04]: I can.

6
00:08:35,936 --> 00:08:38,217
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't hear you.

7
00:08:38,237 --> 00:08:40,857
[SPEAKER_04]: The mic is on.

8
00:08:40,877 --> 00:08:44,158
[SPEAKER_04]: I can hear him.

9
00:08:44,178 --> 00:08:46,119
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you hear me?

10
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:47,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

11
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:52,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, my mic and video are both on according to my screen here.

12
00:09:22,655 --> 00:09:23,736
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, let's try that again.

13
00:09:26,077 --> 00:09:26,598
[SPEAKER_06]: Testing.

14
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:34,163
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I can hear you.

15
00:09:37,604 --> 00:09:40,645
[SPEAKER_08]: Justin said he's going to be five minutes late.

16
00:09:42,926 --> 00:09:52,489
[SPEAKER_08]: To be clear, he's not on the committee, but he did a significant amount of work behind this.

17
00:09:52,529 --> 00:09:55,430
[SPEAKER_08]: So he's going to be giving like half the presentation.

18
00:09:55,450 --> 00:10:02,332
[SPEAKER_08]: Zach's not going to be here.

19
00:10:03,552 --> 00:10:05,873
[SPEAKER_08]: Emily, Anna, and Liz all should.

20
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,081
[SPEAKER_08]: arrive momentarily.

21
00:10:16,606 --> 00:10:21,629
[SPEAKER_06]: So Justin sent me an email, a memo, a corrected policy memo.

22
00:10:21,689 --> 00:10:23,110
[SPEAKER_06]: Does he want me to send that out tonight?

23
00:10:23,911 --> 00:10:26,692
[SPEAKER_05]: Or is that the Tuesday's meeting?

24
00:10:26,732 --> 00:10:27,853
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, send it out.

25
00:10:27,873 --> 00:10:31,495
[SPEAKER_08]: You can just send it out immediately.

26
00:10:31,515 --> 00:10:33,937
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'll send that out to everybody that

27
00:10:35,558 --> 00:10:39,780
[SPEAKER_08]: Just the Councilors on the planning and permitting committee.

28
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:44,843
[SPEAKER_08]: So Emily, Liz, Zach, and Anna.

29
00:10:45,283 --> 00:10:45,543
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

30
00:11:07,815 --> 00:11:08,175
[SPEAKER_06]: Well said.

31
00:12:19,194 --> 00:12:19,334
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool.

32
00:12:19,394 --> 00:12:24,695
[SPEAKER_08]: Rich, how full is City Hall from the community meeting in there if you've seen it?

33
00:12:26,142 --> 00:12:31,985
[SPEAKER_05]: I have not seen it, but a busload of, and I say a school busload of people have dropped off.

34
00:12:34,846 --> 00:12:45,852
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so we do have quorum now, but I want to wait for Liz and Justin still.

35
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:00,200
[SPEAKER_08]: No, they're commuting.

36
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,802
[SPEAKER_08]: They're commuting home.

37
00:13:04,005 --> 00:13:04,806
[SPEAKER_08]: Text me about it.

38
00:13:04,866 --> 00:13:08,850
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently the snow is really slowing people down.

39
00:14:12,343 --> 00:14:15,224
[SPEAKER_06]: There's Liz.

40
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:36,631
[SPEAKER_08]: Liz, did you drop Justin off?

41
00:14:36,731 --> 00:14:37,732
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I just did.

42
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:40,432
[SPEAKER_11]: The traffic's pretty bad with the snow and everything.

43
00:14:41,393 --> 00:14:41,873
[SPEAKER_11]: Gotcha.

44
00:15:27,048 --> 00:15:27,888
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's Justin.

45
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:33,171
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, looks like we have everyone here.

46
00:15:35,793 --> 00:15:41,396
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a meeting of the Medford City Council Planning and Permitting Committee.

47
00:15:42,257 --> 00:15:45,399
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Clerk, when you're ready, will you please call the roll?

48
00:15:55,395 --> 00:15:56,336
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice Chair Bears.

49
00:15:59,257 --> 00:16:00,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice Chair Bears.

50
00:16:02,099 --> 00:16:02,939
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Callahan.

51
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:03,800
[SPEAKER_02]: Present.

52
00:16:08,062 --> 00:16:09,143
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Lazzaro.

53
00:16:09,743 --> 00:16:10,184
[SPEAKER_02]: Present.

54
00:16:14,526 --> 00:16:15,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Malauulu.

55
00:16:16,688 --> 00:16:17,108
[SPEAKER_11]: Present.

56
00:16:18,609 --> 00:16:19,009
[SPEAKER_08]: Chair Lynn.

57
00:16:20,286 --> 00:16:25,308
[SPEAKER_08]: Present for present one absent meeting is called to order.

58
00:16:25,968 --> 00:16:34,352
[SPEAKER_08]: We're talking during this meeting about a proposal for an update to our vacant properties ordinance.

59
00:16:37,186 --> 00:16:45,470
[SPEAKER_08]: The way that this will go is I'll be giving about half this presentation, then I'll hand it off to Justin.

60
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:55,434
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll take questions from councillors as well as staff members, then open it up to the general public.

61
00:16:56,675 --> 00:17:00,997
[SPEAKER_08]: To get started with the presentation, vacant or abandoned properties

62
00:17:02,095 --> 00:17:08,259
[SPEAKER_08]: create and pose pretty significant and costly problems for Medford.

63
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:19,065
[SPEAKER_08]: They're often a drain on our budget, and they detract from the quality of life of neighborhoods and the city as a whole.

64
00:17:20,566 --> 00:17:28,050
[SPEAKER_08]: When people see vacant properties, they're often unsightly, structurally unsound.

65
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:31,492
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes they can even be dangerous to public health.

66
00:17:34,064 --> 00:17:48,169
[SPEAKER_08]: And what this proposal does is it will create a registration process that is intended to prevent or mitigate dangers to health, safety and welfare, promote responsible management of these properties.

67
00:17:48,934 --> 00:18:06,119
[SPEAKER_08]: provide a safe neighborhood for residents, safeguard property values, expedite building repairs, and provide for prompt contact with owners or managers by police, fire, code enforcement, potential tenants when issues arise.

68
00:18:09,915 --> 00:18:14,157
[SPEAKER_08]: So Medford has had a couple of vacant buildings for a long time.

69
00:18:14,177 --> 00:18:24,262
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a frequent subject that Councilors will hear about during my own campaign.

70
00:18:26,285 --> 00:18:29,206
[SPEAKER_08]: I talked a lot about a potential commercial vacancy tax.

71
00:18:30,967 --> 00:18:35,668
[SPEAKER_08]: Even if there's only a handful of properties that people talk about, they tend to be noticed.

72
00:18:35,748 --> 00:18:39,949
[SPEAKER_08]: And if they're around for a couple of years, people will bring them up.

73
00:18:40,149 --> 00:18:43,150
[SPEAKER_08]: They create harm to economic vitality.

74
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:47,811
[SPEAKER_08]: They reduce foot traffic and just generally contribute to a sense of blight.

75
00:18:49,251 --> 00:19:12,019
[SPEAKER_08]: the so what we've done for this proposed ordinance is that we've had we've had a couple meetings about this in the past there was one that took place last year where we had a version of an ordinance the admin at the admin at the time said that they wanted to go another

76
00:19:14,337 --> 00:19:16,818
[SPEAKER_08]: route with it, and we acceded to that.

77
00:19:17,658 --> 00:19:36,142
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Tseng, who is not on this committee, but he's, of course, a member of the council, and he's attending, and he did a lot of work on this, drafted the current version of the vacant building ordinance that we're discussing tonight with a team of his at Harvard Law School.

78
00:19:37,122 --> 00:19:42,843
[SPEAKER_08]: To update this ordinance, the council sought and incorporated feedback

79
00:19:43,423 --> 00:19:57,559
[SPEAKER_08]: from the building commissioner, PDS, other interested parties, and sought feedback from other municipal leaders and other communities in Massachusetts that also attempted to tackle the issue.

80
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:03,426
[SPEAKER_08]: We sought feedback in earnest from a lot of different stakeholders when developing this.

81
00:20:04,635 --> 00:20:20,460
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, what we've generally found, uh, is that landlords that are sitting on these vacant properties tend to hold out for, uh, higher paying tenants and to do so they're willing to keep caught.

82
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:32,904
[SPEAKER_08]: They're willing to sort of pay a property taxes, uh, for a long period of time, uh, eviction costs and, uh, are very high.

83
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:49,467
[SPEAKER_08]: They often have an inability to pay to bring their own buildings with the code and the value of waiting and keeping the option of getting a good tenant in the future often exceeds the lost rent that they have over the years of keeping those buildings vacant.

84
00:20:51,144 --> 00:20:57,507
[SPEAKER_08]: We have had limited success with existing measures.

85
00:20:58,407 --> 00:21:04,670
[SPEAKER_08]: State tax credits do require very long vacancies, so there tends to be a list of requirements.

86
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,711
[SPEAKER_08]: The grants that we have are small and highly restricted.

87
00:21:07,731 --> 00:21:16,855
[SPEAKER_08]: I will acknowledge that we've gotten a larger grant this year, but grants also don't create long-term stability for new business owners.

88
00:21:17,816 --> 00:21:24,190
[SPEAKER_08]: And the current ordinances do give us very limited ability to engage with property owners directly.

89
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:25,773
[SPEAKER_08]: It's often been when

90
00:21:28,511 --> 00:21:39,098
[SPEAKER_08]: the previous economic development director was in, he often said that he would sometimes say that he would have trouble actually getting in contact with some of the owners of these properties.

91
00:21:39,118 --> 00:21:44,742
[SPEAKER_08]: I've heard the same anecdotally from potential tenants as well.

92
00:21:45,122 --> 00:21:49,005
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a little bit tricky to figure out how to figure out who to contact.

93
00:21:49,625 --> 00:22:10,688
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll also mention here that I fully support continuing on with grant programs, other carrots, so to speak, to get these storefront owners to fill their vacant properties, but it can work in conjunction with a vacancy ordinance that has a little bit more teeth to it.

94
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:19,645
[SPEAKER_08]: These are some of the emails that I received from residents over the years.

95
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:29,652
[SPEAKER_08]: I took excerpts from them just to sort of reflect the idea that residents do complain about these things a lot, rightfully so, to us.

96
00:22:30,673 --> 00:22:38,359
[SPEAKER_08]: Generally speaking, when I was talking about the idea for a commercial vacancy tax, it saw popular support from

97
00:22:39,977 --> 00:22:44,320
[SPEAKER_08]: just members of the general public, people tended to like the idea of it.

98
00:22:46,462 --> 00:22:54,727
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think people are generally frustrated with the state of some of the vacant properties around Medford.

99
00:22:55,228 --> 00:23:07,416
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll also say that the photos in the previous couple slides that we've seen are not, those aren't photos I took myself, those are photos that were sent to me by residents over the years.

100
00:23:09,717 --> 00:23:16,343
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll also point out that when I say the word tax here, I said that during the campaign.

101
00:23:16,363 --> 00:23:19,446
[SPEAKER_08]: That was the terminology I was using at the time.

102
00:23:19,466 --> 00:23:26,572
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't actually have the ability to levy a tax as a city, but that was what I was

103
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:34,898
[SPEAKER_08]: The, the, the idea at the time was to submit a home rule petition to the state, but that's right now that's a, it's a fee that we're talking about.

104
00:23:34,958 --> 00:23:40,002
[SPEAKER_08]: So, but this is just an idea to sort of give the sort of give the offer an idea of the history of this.

105
00:23:40,022 --> 00:23:41,623
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

106
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:51,527
[SPEAKER_08]: Other municipalities, which Justin's team interviewed, have had success with similar vacant building policies.

107
00:23:52,207 --> 00:24:07,452
[SPEAKER_08]: The biggest one is East Hampton, which imposed a $500 vacant storefront registration fee that escalates for each year of vacancy, waiving and waives those fees for properties that have public art displays.

108
00:24:08,972 --> 00:24:16,276
[SPEAKER_08]: The mayor of East Hampton in the interviews thought the policy was the reason for the reduction of vacant storefronts filling all but two of them.

109
00:24:17,256 --> 00:24:25,040
[SPEAKER_08]: Lowell imposes a thousand dollar vacant storefront registration fee, which escalates an additional thousand dollars each year vacancy Arlington.

110
00:24:25,671 --> 00:24:32,718
[SPEAKER_08]: has a similar fee as well that they thought was a useful tool for improving building upkeep.

111
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:40,145
[SPEAKER_08]: New Bedford implemented a similar fee, and they also tended to like the results.

112
00:24:42,127 --> 00:24:48,614
[SPEAKER_08]: They saw improved maintenance, a robust database of information on vacant properties that it funded,

113
00:24:49,396 --> 00:24:53,098
[SPEAKER_08]: and tended to improve communication with property owners.

114
00:24:53,838 --> 00:25:03,322
[SPEAKER_08]: Outside of Massachusetts, San Francisco also had their own vacancy tax, which they implemented relatively recently.

115
00:25:04,462 --> 00:25:11,325
[SPEAKER_08]: So early evidence of this indicates that it contributed to a 50% reduction in vacancy rates across the city.

116
00:25:11,465 --> 00:25:14,246
[SPEAKER_08]: So these have led.

117
00:25:15,885 --> 00:25:21,688
[SPEAKER_08]: Having similar fees are generally very supported in other cities, are generally pretty supported by the business community.

118
00:25:23,089 --> 00:25:32,114
[SPEAKER_08]: They lead to sharp reductions in vacancy rates, and they've tended to be good for the economic development of those cities.

119
00:25:33,454 --> 00:25:36,436
[SPEAKER_08]: So for the next part of the presentation, what we're

120
00:25:36,948 --> 00:25:41,411
[SPEAKER_08]: what we're gonna do is talk about what is actually in the proposed ordinance.

121
00:25:41,591 --> 00:25:52,619
[SPEAKER_08]: And after that, we tacked on a frequently asked question section just to kind of like discuss some of the talking points that usually come up in response to this.

122
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:56,722
[SPEAKER_08]: For this part, I'm going to pass it off to my colleague, Councilor Tseng.

123
00:25:58,463 --> 00:26:02,326
[SPEAKER_08]: Justin, just say next slide when you want me to switch.

124
00:26:02,947 --> 00:26:03,667
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool, thank you.

125
00:26:05,987 --> 00:26:11,991
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, I want to thank everyone for taking the time out of your work days to be with us tonight.

126
00:26:12,392 --> 00:26:16,294
[SPEAKER_01]: I know everyone's really busy, especially with the snowstorm.

127
00:26:16,334 --> 00:26:17,835
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a really busy week for all of us.

128
00:26:20,924 --> 00:26:30,388
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess just to give a little bit more background about the work that my group and I did, we did it under the direction of a professor at Harvard Law.

129
00:26:31,868 --> 00:26:39,351
[SPEAKER_01]: Essentially, the project was to identify a problem in the community, interview stakeholders,

130
00:26:41,309 --> 00:26:59,642
[SPEAKER_01]: look at different municipalities and in Massachusetts, especially, and across the country, talk to the people from their offices, see what they did about the problem, what they've been experiencing, any drawbacks, shortfalls they've seen in their approaches, and

131
00:27:02,604 --> 00:27:06,686
[SPEAKER_01]: My goal for tonight is to start the conversation and get more feedback on it.

132
00:27:07,327 --> 00:27:21,895
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's also important for me to note my personal journey on this issue, where I wasn't necessarily, if you go back into the minutes of on this paper, I wasn't always the most supportive of a vacancy fee.

133
00:27:22,875 --> 00:27:46,690
[SPEAKER_01]: But in doing the research, something that the different towns and cities across Massachusetts, their economic planning staff and their elected officials have kind of reported is that when they've tried grant-only approaches or inspection-based approaches, they still face difficulties of being able to contact absentee landlords.

134
00:27:48,031 --> 00:27:58,980
[SPEAKER_01]: And to encourage business growth in the city, and it was only when they kind of joined all these pieces together with the vacancy fee that they've seen pretty much full compliance and.

135
00:28:02,348 --> 00:28:17,950
[SPEAKER_01]: you know with that being said that there are um you know there are challenges which I've kind of built uh kind of been able to walk through with them in depth and kind of uh present what I've presented what I'm going to present tonight to them and kind of worked through it with

136
00:28:18,557 --> 00:28:20,058
[SPEAKER_01]: them to pick their minds about it.

137
00:28:20,218 --> 00:28:28,945
[SPEAKER_01]: And in particular, I have to thank the mayor of East Hampton, who wrote his city's vacant building ordinance.

138
00:28:28,985 --> 00:28:31,847
[SPEAKER_01]: He chaired the committee on it when he was on the city council.

139
00:28:31,967 --> 00:28:34,388
[SPEAKER_01]: He has also been in charge of implementing it.

140
00:28:35,509 --> 00:28:42,875
[SPEAKER_01]: And we walked through line by line the ordinance and kind of got his feedback and takes on it as well.

141
00:28:44,776 --> 00:28:57,604
[SPEAKER_01]: The draft text that you have before you guys and that I'm going to summarize in these slides pretty much take from Arlington, East Hampton, Melrose, communities surrounding us.

142
00:28:58,384 --> 00:29:08,811
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand that it's ambitious and, you know, I think that's why it's helpful to have us all here tonight to talk through what we like and, you know, ways to make this fit our city even better.

143
00:29:09,511 --> 00:29:12,333
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Matt, if you want to go to the next slide.

144
00:29:13,845 --> 00:29:28,335
[SPEAKER_01]: So, essentially, what we're proposing is in all other in a lot of other Massachusetts municipalities, the vacant properties ordinances are actually not.

145
00:29:28,841 --> 00:29:42,428
[SPEAKER_01]: Contained in the zoning code, and they're actually contained within the building department section of the of the code of ordinances that allows them more flexibility to make edits and adjustments to kind of correct course.

146
00:29:42,969 --> 00:29:44,610
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if any issues arise.

147
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:47,530
[SPEAKER_01]: This essentially is a modernization effort.

148
00:29:48,711 --> 00:29:53,472
[SPEAKER_01]: And so modernization efforts start with the very beginning of the ordinance, the purposes.

149
00:29:54,132 --> 00:30:07,574
[SPEAKER_01]: And this just builds on top of what we already have in our vacant properties ordinance, which is pretty much only about kind of bare bones when it comes to guidance for the city.

150
00:30:08,835 --> 00:30:09,255
[SPEAKER_01]: And so,

151
00:30:10,562 --> 00:30:25,739
[SPEAKER_01]: Importantly, the purpose of the ordinance is to establish, develop and maintain an online registry of vacant properties in the city to conduct inspections provided for in this section and kind of do that reform process.

152
00:30:27,201 --> 00:30:41,678
[SPEAKER_01]: provide an appeal system for those who feel that they've been aggrieved by the requirements of the section, and to mitigate negative effects of vacant or closing properties, those same things that Matt started this presentation on.

153
00:30:43,698 --> 00:30:45,498
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Matt, if you wanted to go to the next slide.

154
00:30:47,339 --> 00:30:53,440
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the big proposals in the text before you guys is to create a database.

155
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:59,221
[SPEAKER_01]: Matt's absolutely correct that we as a city can't create new taxes.

156
00:31:01,081 --> 00:31:09,323
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a complex set of laws with regards to what taxes a city can levy on its residents and its property owners.

157
00:31:12,285 --> 00:31:26,407
[SPEAKER_01]: But we can create fees, but the fees must be proportional to a service being used and the numbers that are in the ordinance right now I'm really happy to, you know, get feedback on and hear if that does seem proportional.

158
00:31:28,089 --> 00:31:39,921
[SPEAKER_01]: The the memo that you guys might have seen slash should have gotten kind of walks through how we got to the numbers that we are proposing in the ordinance.

159
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:47,269
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, this is something that is it's a sort of a conversation, essentially.

160
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:53,611
[SPEAKER_01]: In most cities, what you have is a database.

161
00:31:54,311 --> 00:32:04,594
[SPEAKER_01]: Most cities that have a vacant property fee have a database online that helps publicize vacant properties and on this database, and some of this is already required in our current ordinance.

162
00:32:05,034 --> 00:32:07,795
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just kind of like updating it for the internet age.

163
00:32:10,635 --> 00:32:16,817
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the basics, owner's name, address, telephone number, you know, the street number,

164
00:32:18,459 --> 00:32:26,763
[SPEAKER_01]: property type, square footage, contact information for property managers, if that's applicable.

165
00:32:28,424 --> 00:32:32,726
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we've added in some things that other cities don't have that Medford already has.

166
00:32:33,426 --> 00:32:34,426
[SPEAKER_01]: And then something that

167
00:32:35,767 --> 00:32:56,853
[SPEAKER_01]: other economic development planning staff from other cities have mentioned is really helpful are things like clear photographs of interior rooms and street-facing exteriors and storefront status and the use that is allowed under zoning for that property.

168
00:32:59,874 --> 00:33:01,235
[SPEAKER_01]: Matt, if you could go to the next slide.

169
00:33:02,508 --> 00:33:09,109
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of explained earlier on the proposed numbers.

170
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:29,874
[SPEAKER_01]: In talking to staff from different cities, they found the escalating structure, where it's like, for example, $1,000 in the first year of vacancy, $2,000 in the second, and then $3,000 each year, to be really effective as a deterrent for bad behavior.

171
00:33:32,081 --> 00:33:48,247
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've also built in a lot of waivers and the waivers are, you know, they're quite inherent to a lot of these ordinances, substantial financial hardship, public kind of public art especially is really common.

172
00:33:50,349 --> 00:33:58,820
[SPEAKER_01]: improvement for future use, special cases like condemnation, that's pretty standard.

173
00:33:59,401 --> 00:34:03,686
[SPEAKER_01]: We have added some innovations that other cities

174
00:34:04,647 --> 00:34:16,890
[SPEAKER_01]: were kind of interested in, that they said that they would add in if they could rewrite the ordinance, like community events and planning for upcoming changes to the zoning code.

175
00:34:18,410 --> 00:34:30,672
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a resident who wrote to us before this meeting who suggested, he's a lawyer, he suggested that we put in a waiver for properties whose titles are in dispute.

176
00:34:31,012 --> 00:34:32,873
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have some draft language

177
00:34:34,334 --> 00:34:38,876
[SPEAKER_01]: with regards to that to propose after the presentation.

178
00:34:40,617 --> 00:34:54,046
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, just quickly before higher maintenance standards, something that a lot of kind of folks from other municipalities have told me is that

179
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:59,591
[SPEAKER_01]: For the most part, they haven't even gotten to the fee part.

180
00:35:00,252 --> 00:35:09,282
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, in East Hampton, I think they had 10 or 12 properties that were vacant, and they've only had to charge one or two properties with the fee.

181
00:35:10,943 --> 00:35:18,006
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they've really seen a huge drop off since, since the ordinance, their ordinance has been passed.

182
00:35:19,346 --> 00:35:22,748
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing in Arlington where there's actually really low.

183
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:28,911
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of events where the fee is charged.

184
00:35:30,072 --> 00:35:35,356
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've in both municipalities, they've done quite also quite a long phase and period.

185
00:35:35,477 --> 00:35:50,809
[SPEAKER_01]: And both, you know, pretty much everyone I talk to who works in a city with this fee has said that it's really the passage of the ordinance that is a big deterrent and gets people in touch with their economic planning offices.

186
00:35:55,048 --> 00:36:00,374
[SPEAKER_01]: So when it comes to like inspectional standards, that's a huge other huge component that

187
00:36:02,345 --> 00:36:07,988
[SPEAKER_01]: is quite, at the very least, standard, even in cities without the fee structure.

188
00:36:08,668 --> 00:36:16,631
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a much more robust inspection, inspectional regime for vacant properties than we do in our current ordinance.

189
00:36:17,472 --> 00:36:25,555
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanna thank Building Commissioner Van der Waal for sending me comments that I've tried my best to integrate.

190
00:36:26,636 --> 00:36:31,338
[SPEAKER_01]: The only things that I haven't integrated are kind of unresolved legal questions for KP law.

191
00:36:32,118 --> 00:36:47,252
[SPEAKER_01]: And things that should probably be left up to discretion and not baked into law in the ordinance itself that we can kind of, we should develop after the passage of the ordinance.

192
00:36:50,068 --> 00:37:07,540
[SPEAKER_01]: basically monthly vacant property inspections, 24-hour contact numbers of a local individual or property management company in charge of the property, rodent mitigation measures, repairs to broken windows and doors,

193
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:17,662
[SPEAKER_01]: This is, you know, there's a public health and public safety element to the inspections component as well that isn't necessarily built out in our current ordinance.

194
00:37:18,162 --> 00:37:36,787
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is something that in talking to one of the members of the Chamber of Commerce was really important to them was that we really kind of build out the inspections process and use that as a another kind of deterrent in to deal with the problems we're seeing.

195
00:37:39,113 --> 00:37:40,613
[SPEAKER_01]: If you could go to the next slide, please.

196
00:37:43,334 --> 00:37:44,674
[SPEAKER_01]: This just builds on top of it.

197
00:37:47,455 --> 00:38:02,799
[SPEAKER_01]: Just, you know, authorizing different people in our city to inspect properties or to send their designees to inspect properties, authorizing them to issue fines and citations for violations and so on.

198
00:38:04,547 --> 00:38:06,649
[SPEAKER_01]: if you could go forward to.

199
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:13,454
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, with any ordinance, we have to consider the enforcement regime as well.

200
00:38:16,767 --> 00:38:33,052
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually with the, because this is a building kind of falls under the building code, not building code, building department section of most code of ordinances, usually it's the building department that enforces it.

201
00:38:33,132 --> 00:38:38,974
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's, of course, with the health components of it, the board of health as well, or their designees.

202
00:38:41,329 --> 00:38:58,879
[SPEAKER_01]: We've explained in the memo the fine structure as well, but essentially for each step of, for each way that you could break the ordinance, for example, just kind of elucidating that those fines are applicable to those sections.

203
00:38:58,899 --> 00:39:03,601
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something that's required by state law that we list out specifically in the ordinance.

204
00:39:07,324 --> 00:39:11,186
[SPEAKER_01]: We've built in some time to remedy issues prior to the issuance of fines.

205
00:39:11,847 --> 00:39:26,276
[SPEAKER_01]: And kind of built in enforcement discretion as well, in case, you know, the city knows that someone, you know, is going to fix the problem in good faith, but isn't able to do it within a seven day time span.

206
00:39:26,957 --> 00:39:29,458
[SPEAKER_01]: And building in an appeals regime.

207
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:39,586
[SPEAKER_01]: If we take it out of the zoning code, then the appeals would not go to ZBA and instead usually they go to the building department.

208
00:39:40,187 --> 00:39:45,051
[SPEAKER_01]: Something to talk about, of course, but this is kind of more standard.

209
00:39:50,586 --> 00:39:51,367
[SPEAKER_01]: Matt, if you could.

210
00:39:52,408 --> 00:39:52,768
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

211
00:39:54,671 --> 00:40:05,384
[SPEAKER_01]: Essentially, when we were doing the legal research about the case law and with regards to statutes, we really only have two mechanisms to enforce.

212
00:40:05,724 --> 00:40:07,306
[SPEAKER_01]: There's condemnation, which is really

213
00:40:08,227 --> 00:40:08,928
[SPEAKER_01]: not preferable.

214
00:40:09,989 --> 00:40:13,151
[SPEAKER_01]: It creates liability and responsibility for ourselves as a city.

215
00:40:14,432 --> 00:40:21,618
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's something that Commissioner VanderWaal noted in his comments, something that we really tried to avoid.

216
00:40:22,579 --> 00:40:29,024
[SPEAKER_01]: And so fines are the only really other means available to us for enforcement.

217
00:40:32,828 --> 00:40:33,568
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in summary,

218
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:51,260
[SPEAKER_01]: This is really about giving us more leverage than before to deal with negligent landlords and to have both carrots and sticks on the table to deal with the problem of vacant storefronts.

219
00:40:54,865 --> 00:41:23,150
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of this is repetitive of what we said before, but essentially it's really about investing in the neighborhood vitality and aesthetics, especially in our local commercial squares, adding a practical and legally sound tool to our toolkit, while also building into the ordinance itself much more discretion for when we choose to enforce the ordinance or just, you know, basically it's about bringing the other party to the table.

220
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:40,761
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, as noted, in Massachusetts and across the country, this type of ordinance or this type of update to the vacant properties ordinance has seen reductions in vacancies.

221
00:41:41,042 --> 00:41:50,889
[SPEAKER_01]: It's seen improved communications with property owners and improved upkeep and kind of authorizations for inspections if we need that.

222
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:58,635
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I want to kind of underline that a lot of this is just authorizing the city to do stuff.

223
00:41:58,915 --> 00:42:02,598
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not necessarily making it mandatory to do everything.

224
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:09,083
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just basically giving us the discretion to use this tool if we need it.

225
00:42:12,253 --> 00:42:14,835
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on the next slide, I've prepared kind of a chart.

226
00:42:15,315 --> 00:42:19,818
[SPEAKER_01]: This is also in the policy memo itself of how it would work, because I know it's a lot of information.

227
00:42:20,518 --> 00:42:25,421
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we've prepared kind of a flowchart of how it would work.

228
00:42:25,761 --> 00:42:33,605
[SPEAKER_01]: It wouldn't apply to residential properties, but it would apply to properties that have commercial or industrial uses contained within them.

229
00:42:36,631 --> 00:42:48,371
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, registration, permit fee, increase in fee, waivers, inspectional requirements, and fines.

230
00:42:48,791 --> 00:42:50,214
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all contained in this chart.

231
00:42:52,063 --> 00:42:54,105
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe, Matt, you've prepared a few slides afterwards.

232
00:42:54,125 --> 00:42:56,288
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll hand it back over to you.

233
00:42:56,908 --> 00:42:57,048
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

234
00:42:57,189 --> 00:42:57,509
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

235
00:42:57,649 --> 00:42:58,910
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

236
00:42:58,930 --> 00:43:01,213
[SPEAKER_08]: And feel free to jump in for these.

237
00:43:01,253 --> 00:43:04,436
[SPEAKER_08]: This could just be kind of a bit more of a discussion point.

238
00:43:04,556 --> 00:43:08,501
[SPEAKER_08]: But in talking over some of these proposals with

239
00:43:10,133 --> 00:43:21,426
[SPEAKER_08]: with stakeholders, we do tend to run into a couple of points that we've heard come up a lot.

240
00:43:22,467 --> 00:43:29,775
[SPEAKER_08]: I think when people hear vacant building ordinance, they think, oh, you're just going to charge everybody an arm and a leg.

241
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:33,802
[SPEAKER_08]: whenever they can't find a new tenant for their storefront.

242
00:43:33,862 --> 00:43:42,907
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's really, there's a lot more nuance to it, but there also is like, there also does tend to be some concerns from folks.

243
00:43:43,007 --> 00:43:50,130
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I just added three, we just added three FAQ slides in response to some of these questions that come up at the end, just to kind of talk through them.

244
00:43:51,511 --> 00:43:51,891
[SPEAKER_08]: The first,

245
00:43:53,732 --> 00:43:59,721
[SPEAKER_08]: Is the first thing that we've heard is will this proposal attract undesirable businesses.

246
00:44:00,882 --> 00:44:10,275
[SPEAKER_08]: The idea being that if we tell business owners that they're going to that we're going to charge them if they keep their stores vacant, are they just kind of, you know,

247
00:44:11,842 --> 00:44:22,910
[SPEAKER_08]: Are they just going to get a pawn shop in there or put another bank in Medford Square or whoever is the first person to occupy the territory?

248
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:24,491
[SPEAKER_08]: A couple of points to that.

249
00:44:24,671 --> 00:44:33,678
[SPEAKER_08]: First, the vacant building registry, it acts as an advertisement for these spaces and it makes it a lot easier for potential tenants to get in contact with businesses.

250
00:44:34,558 --> 00:44:53,177
[SPEAKER_08]: So, having something like this up and running and kind of giving landlords a bit of a stick to come to the table, or at least specify a property management company will help this communication and art between the economic development director between city staff and between.

251
00:44:54,558 --> 00:44:55,379
[SPEAKER_08]: potential tenants.

252
00:44:56,399 --> 00:45:17,618
[SPEAKER_08]: It also gives the building commissioner pretty significant discretion to distinguish between absentee landlords who are just kind of sitting on their properties and not doing anything with them and landlords who may earnestly be trying to find a good tenant but are experiencing some form of financial hardship or just have a situation.

253
00:45:17,658 --> 00:45:19,820
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's not like an automatic

254
00:45:21,581 --> 00:45:30,207
[SPEAKER_08]: set of rules there is there is a lot of discretion that is built in in the waiver system and whatnot to kind of make sure that this doesn't happen.

255
00:45:30,707 --> 00:45:48,859
[SPEAKER_08]: And the last point is really that zoning changes which the city is currently doing right now, City Council with in collaboration with PDS really should be where we're thinking where we're our minds are sort of going when we're thinking about what kind of businesses do we want in

256
00:45:49,707 --> 00:45:50,888
[SPEAKER_08]: Medford.

257
00:45:53,229 --> 00:46:00,514
[SPEAKER_08]: So my mind keeps going back to this, but people keep complaining about banks in Medford Square.

258
00:46:00,654 --> 00:46:06,398
[SPEAKER_08]: And if there happens to be a vacancy coming up in Medford Square, will they just open up another bank?

259
00:46:06,458 --> 00:46:09,700
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's an issue that really needs to be solved with our

260
00:46:10,521 --> 00:46:15,447
[SPEAKER_08]: zoning codes, and that's something that we're actively trying to solve in other areas.

261
00:46:15,507 --> 00:46:17,790
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's the first question.

262
00:46:17,870 --> 00:46:22,216
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, Councilor Tseng, if you have anything you want to add, just feel free to go.

263
00:46:22,907 --> 00:46:39,537
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean I just wanted to say anecdotally like this was this was the question that I had really like struggled with before I, you know, jumped into interviews with people across the across the state and including with the from the state government.

264
00:46:43,067 --> 00:47:00,996
[SPEAKER_01]: And through the conversations, basically, they've emphasized like this discretion, like if you can build more discretion into the ordinance, that's something that would give us a lot more kind of ability to like deal with this problem, like potential problem if it arises.

265
00:47:02,457 --> 00:47:08,100
[SPEAKER_01]: At the same time, you know, I explored building in like exceptions for just like,

266
00:47:10,631 --> 00:47:15,595
[SPEAKER_01]: for us to not charge a fee if it looks like a quote-unquote undesirable business is going in.

267
00:47:16,891 --> 00:47:21,352
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think it's really hard to do that right without, um, conforming to the zoning.

268
00:47:21,852 --> 00:47:25,293
[SPEAKER_01]: And so zoning is the real kind of the most solid answer there.

269
00:47:26,153 --> 00:47:31,574
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but at the same time, the timeline for this is quite long.

270
00:47:32,294 --> 00:47:36,115
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and we can always, you know, revisit that timeline too.

271
00:47:36,855 --> 00:47:43,917
[SPEAKER_01]: If, if, if needed, be it during this round of editing or, um, in the future, if we kind of.

272
00:47:45,037 --> 00:47:46,659
[SPEAKER_01]: see that that arises as a problem.

273
00:47:46,999 --> 00:47:51,843
[SPEAKER_01]: We could change the timelines.

274
00:47:53,404 --> 00:48:03,432
[SPEAKER_08]: The next question that I kind of see come up a lot can be summarized by this, which is, can't the city just charge more for inspection and fractions?

275
00:48:03,552 --> 00:48:12,720
[SPEAKER_08]: And where this comes from is, I've heard people say, like, oh, I don't want to, again, it's like, I don't want to charge landlords

276
00:48:13,421 --> 00:48:23,478
[SPEAKER_08]: An arm and a leg aren't there other, but I do want to see the city have more teeth over over enforcing these, these.

277
00:48:25,004 --> 00:48:27,906
[SPEAKER_08]: vacant building or disincentivizing vacant buildings.

278
00:48:28,366 --> 00:48:30,768
[SPEAKER_08]: So can't you just do something else?

279
00:48:30,788 --> 00:48:33,850
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, can't you make it so that your inspections have more teeth?

280
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:35,371
[SPEAKER_08]: And the answer is really no.

281
00:48:36,712 --> 00:48:49,300
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think, again, the only two mechanisms that the city really has to enforce anything it says is fines and condemnation.

282
00:48:50,802 --> 00:49:04,522
[SPEAKER_08]: And when it comes, and if you wanted, if you had the idea, and I think Justin can talk more to this about charging more for infractions of inspection specifically, as opposed to vacancies or things related to that.

283
00:49:05,605 --> 00:49:12,968
[SPEAKER_08]: There are limitations in state law to how much cities can actually charge for that class of infraction, so we can't really legislate that.

284
00:49:13,569 --> 00:49:27,334
[SPEAKER_08]: Vacant building ordinances, like the ones that have been proposed here, is really the method that cities are going to disincentivize this sort of thing.

285
00:49:27,715 --> 00:49:28,415
[SPEAKER_08]: Justin, do you have any?

286
00:49:28,865 --> 00:49:34,326
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, I think there's more about it in the legal analysis part of the memo that I sent out.

287
00:49:35,346 --> 00:49:37,407
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have the the statutes in front of me.

288
00:49:37,547 --> 00:49:50,570
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also something that I think, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think Commissioner VanderWaal might have flagged it and said that we were going to, we were talking to KP law about kind of just figuring out all these like

289
00:49:51,670 --> 00:49:59,076
[SPEAKER_01]: the limits on the fines and penalties, because some might actually be for criminal offenses and not civil offenses.

290
00:50:00,838 --> 00:50:06,822
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something that we would have to revisit across the whole code of ordinances, like across everything we've passed.

291
00:50:08,264 --> 00:50:11,186
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, there are certain limitations.

292
00:50:11,206 --> 00:50:11,666
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

293
00:50:15,006 --> 00:50:19,248
[SPEAKER_08]: And the last one is, will this encourage or discourage development?

294
00:50:19,268 --> 00:50:23,049
[SPEAKER_08]: This was a slide that I prepared in the last hour.

295
00:50:25,330 --> 00:50:26,671
[SPEAKER_08]: It's up for discussion.

296
00:50:26,871 --> 00:50:34,354
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think the fear that this question reflects is, OK,

297
00:50:36,922 --> 00:50:44,264
[SPEAKER_08]: Will a vacant building owner just try to sell off or try to find a new tenant immediately?

298
00:50:44,284 --> 00:50:52,107
[SPEAKER_08]: Or will, if they do sell off the building to a developer, is there going to be like, and the developer is, you know,

299
00:50:52,707 --> 00:51:06,194
[SPEAKER_08]: redoing or rebuilding an old building, building something new there, will there be this period of vacancy lasting several years potentially that would be charging?

300
00:51:06,254 --> 00:51:07,054
[SPEAKER_08]: And the answer is no.

301
00:51:07,074 --> 00:51:07,794
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, there are

302
00:51:09,435 --> 00:51:12,919
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, exemptions within the vacant building ordinance for new construction.

303
00:51:12,939 --> 00:51:18,145
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, if anything, this would sort of prevent building, um, current building owners from kind of waiting.

304
00:51:18,165 --> 00:51:21,328
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, for, uh, that.

305
00:51:22,009 --> 00:51:25,753
[SPEAKER_08]: That whale to come along that they're really looking for, just like, sitting on their property.

306
00:51:25,813 --> 00:51:27,395
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think so this would.

307
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:44,348
[SPEAKER_08]: encourage development and there are mechanisms written in there to kind of distinguish between these long term vacancies that we want to discourage and the vacancies that occur naturally as a result of any new construction.

308
00:51:44,908 --> 00:51:45,749
[SPEAKER_08]: Justin, do you have any.

309
00:51:45,789 --> 00:52:04,342
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah I mean I just really want to underscore that like something that we have that is actually quite innovative that other cities don't necessarily have in their ordinances and I don't think most cities with this type of ordinance have this exception built in is just for new newly constructed buildings.

310
00:52:06,778 --> 00:52:10,941
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we don't want to disincentivize people from building in Medford.

311
00:52:11,021 --> 00:52:12,182
[SPEAKER_01]: We want that to happen here.

312
00:52:13,643 --> 00:52:28,954
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think, I believe it's a one year long kind of exemptions where this whole ordinance just, or the, at the very least the registry and fee part would not apply to a building that's newly constructed.

313
00:52:29,034 --> 00:52:33,237
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we can revisit timelines, very open to feedback on that.

314
00:52:35,223 --> 00:52:44,851
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that's a very important part of this ordinance is making sure that we are not disincentivizing people from building in Medford.

315
00:52:45,751 --> 00:53:01,564
[SPEAKER_01]: At the same time, what research across the country has shown is helpful about vacant property fee and registry is that it also encourages landowners who are sitting on these properties

316
00:53:03,028 --> 00:53:09,150
[SPEAKER_01]: um, that they really don't have the money to fix up, to sell those properties to people who do have the money to fix it up.

317
00:53:09,951 --> 00:53:20,735
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think what we're dealing with writ large here is a real, is, is a bit of a market failure, um, where even the kind of logical math doesn't add up.

318
00:53:21,975 --> 00:53:24,877
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I think that, you know, explains why,

319
00:53:26,422 --> 00:53:33,508
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, logically it would actually make sense if you're sitting on that property that you can't fix and you can't rent out to sell it onto someone else.

320
00:53:33,588 --> 00:53:44,997
[SPEAKER_01]: But in talking to, again, talking to people in Medford and outside of Medford, there's actually, there just seems to be an instinct not to do that.

321
00:53:46,078 --> 00:53:51,903
[SPEAKER_01]: At the same time, there's a market failure when it comes to just, you know, even if you have a perfectly good building,

322
00:53:52,878 --> 00:54:04,768
[SPEAKER_01]: and not renting it out and holding out for people who are willing to pay higher rents for that storefront.

323
00:54:04,968 --> 00:54:14,336
[SPEAKER_01]: Logically, it would make sense for them to rent it out and then raise the rent after, or at least they're making money in the meantime.

324
00:54:16,526 --> 00:54:27,119
[SPEAKER_01]: There seems to be a kind of attitude that holding out and getting tax credit in the meantime or holding out for higher rents

325
00:54:28,163 --> 00:54:29,143
[SPEAKER_01]: is somehow worth it.

326
00:54:29,544 --> 00:54:47,972
[SPEAKER_01]: And even though if you use a calculator, it's not, it's something that is happening that we've heard from landowners here in Medford and from property owners outside of Medford in different, in pretty much every city that I reached out to as well.

327
00:54:48,592 --> 00:54:48,752
[SPEAKER_01]: And

328
00:54:50,952 --> 00:55:02,919
[SPEAKER_01]: the fee essentially is a market correction or an attempt at market correction at kind of getting people to realize that there's actually a bigger cost here.

329
00:55:02,979 --> 00:55:08,702
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a cost to the city and there's a cost to themselves that maybe they haven't really done the right calculations on.

330
00:55:11,424 --> 00:55:11,784
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

331
00:55:12,164 --> 00:55:17,708
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much, Councilor Tseng for both the

332
00:55:18,553 --> 00:55:25,118
[SPEAKER_08]: presentation and your work on this ordinance.

333
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:36,047
[SPEAKER_08]: With that, I'm going to first open up to members of council and then members of city staff if they have any questions.

334
00:55:37,348 --> 00:55:40,351
[SPEAKER_08]: And then after that, members of the public too.

335
00:55:40,951 --> 00:55:45,215
[SPEAKER_08]: If any members of council have any questions, feel free to raise your hand.

336
00:55:51,173 --> 00:55:52,193
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Lazzaro.

337
00:55:53,794 --> 00:55:55,135
[SPEAKER_07]: Council Vice President Lazzaro.

338
00:55:55,535 --> 00:55:56,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

339
00:55:57,196 --> 00:55:59,056
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to voice my support for this.

340
00:55:59,096 --> 00:56:01,297
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate the work you've all put in so far.

341
00:56:02,598 --> 00:56:17,144
[SPEAKER_03]: The previous version of this ordinance was not this comprehensive, and we have been floating something to this effect for a while, but I do think that it's important that

342
00:56:19,225 --> 00:56:28,409
[SPEAKER_03]: we try to cover all of the responses that we've gotten from city staff, from residents, from different stakeholders.

343
00:56:28,949 --> 00:56:37,033
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think you've all done a really good job addressing, attempting to address all of the different responses that we've received.

344
00:56:37,113 --> 00:56:45,677
[SPEAKER_03]: But something that I find to be an overwhelming and reoccurring response

345
00:56:46,873 --> 00:57:02,677
[SPEAKER_03]: is that our residents continue to be frustrated by the ongoing vacancies and what they're perceiving as the lack of a plan from our end.

346
00:57:04,018 --> 00:57:12,740
[SPEAKER_03]: And people continue to ask us during the campaign and not during campaigns, campaign season or not, like, what are you doing to encourage commercial

347
00:57:15,063 --> 00:57:25,747
[SPEAKER_03]: property owners to not just rent out their spaces, but to accept offers from people who would like to rent their spaces.

348
00:57:26,927 --> 00:57:37,471
[SPEAKER_03]: The way that we, I mean, when people are trying to rent their spaces and are not able to because of the impossibility because of the cost or because of

349
00:57:38,771 --> 00:57:48,093
[SPEAKER_03]: various reasons that it just, it shouldn't be easier to not rent out a commercial space than to rent it out.

350
00:57:48,573 --> 00:57:52,333
[SPEAKER_03]: So whatever it is that we have to do to correct for that, I think we should go ahead and do.

351
00:57:53,434 --> 00:58:01,755
[SPEAKER_03]: I really appreciate the effort that's been put in, and I'd love to move this forward, but I appreciate that we're holding this committee meeting.

352
00:58:01,875 --> 00:58:06,056
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we should continue to get feedback from

353
00:58:07,076 --> 00:58:23,681
[SPEAKER_03]: City Hall and from other residents to just hear where people are and what they want us to pay attention to and make sure that we're not bypassing any ongoing issues that may arise.

354
00:58:25,441 --> 00:58:31,903
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing is that the Chamber of Commerce has been, oh God, the Zoom is zooming in, it's being very weird, sorry.

355
00:58:32,083 --> 00:58:33,984
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why it's doing that, please stop.

356
00:58:35,822 --> 00:58:48,092
[SPEAKER_03]: The Chamber of Commerce was hesitant to have this be primarily an ordinance that would result in business owners being penalized.

357
00:58:48,192 --> 00:58:53,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Not the people that would rent the space, but the real estate owners being penalized for not renting their space.

358
00:58:53,256 --> 00:58:59,541
[SPEAKER_03]: Because what if somebody, what if there's an economic downturn and people feel like they cannot rent their space out?

359
00:58:59,601 --> 00:59:01,543
[SPEAKER_03]: That shouldn't be something that somebody is penalized for.

360
00:59:02,403 --> 00:59:06,366
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that this version of the ordinance is correcting for that.

361
00:59:07,227 --> 00:59:19,355
[SPEAKER_03]: Or my hope is that this version of the ordinance would not have that be, well, that's certainly not our intention, but that we're taking pains to be cautious around that.

362
00:59:21,817 --> 00:59:29,282
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, that like, this is not a code enforcement issue, and that we've already, I think the city has already been very,

363
00:59:31,394 --> 00:59:49,045
[SPEAKER_03]: very effectively going through every avenue they have at their disposal to condemn buildings that are condemnable and do the necessary work that they can, but yet these spaces remain empty.

364
00:59:49,105 --> 00:59:58,651
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you condemn a building and then the businesses that were in that space, like what happened in the building close to City Hall in Medford Square, I mean,

365
01:00:00,733 --> 01:00:02,714
[SPEAKER_03]: the space remains blighted.

366
01:00:02,834 --> 01:00:04,335
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, and it can get worse.

367
01:00:04,415 --> 01:00:09,978
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't mean that what happens is the owners of those spaces suddenly fix it up.

368
01:00:10,058 --> 01:00:15,941
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, what happens is then it's empty for longer and that does not solve the problem that we're trying to solve.

369
01:00:15,981 --> 01:00:18,342
[SPEAKER_03]: So I appreciate this.

370
01:00:18,562 --> 01:00:19,343
[SPEAKER_03]: I like what I'm seeing.

371
01:00:19,563 --> 01:00:24,745
[SPEAKER_03]: I do hear from residents that they really wanna see these spaces filled and if we can beautify them in the meantime, let's try to do that.

372
01:00:25,005 --> 01:00:27,006
[SPEAKER_03]: So great work, really appreciate it.

373
01:00:27,307 --> 01:00:27,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

374
01:00:29,357 --> 01:00:30,258
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

375
01:00:30,879 --> 01:00:34,023
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw Councilor Callahan's hand up first, so we'll go to you.

376
01:00:35,362 --> 01:00:35,682
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

377
01:00:36,683 --> 01:00:43,968
[SPEAKER_02]: I so appreciate the amount of time that has gone into this, as well as the community input that you've received so far.

378
01:00:44,709 --> 01:00:46,971
[SPEAKER_02]: And I look forward to getting more community input.

379
01:00:47,811 --> 01:00:52,855
[SPEAKER_02]: I firmly believe that having vacant storefronts is just bad for our community.

380
01:00:54,376 --> 01:01:04,324
[SPEAKER_02]: So many people, as I knocked on doors the past two elections, talked about our squares, not just Medford Square, but all of our squares.

381
01:01:04,864 --> 01:01:12,653
[SPEAKER_02]: being boring, uninviting, unsafe at night, not vibrant.

382
01:01:13,254 --> 01:01:16,478
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a complaint that I hear over and over and over again.

383
01:01:16,498 --> 01:01:22,384
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's very important that we take action where we can.

384
01:01:23,165 --> 01:01:24,866
[SPEAKER_02]: and do what's good for our community.

385
01:01:25,486 --> 01:01:49,460
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I think it's deeply unfortunate that financial incentives encourage people who own buildings, sometimes, not always, but sometimes encourage people who own buildings to leave them vacant because they can make more money if it's vacant and they wait that period out because of the, you know, the way that our,

386
01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:55,222
[SPEAKER_02]: the way that ownership of land works and ownership of property works.

387
01:01:56,103 --> 01:01:57,984
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's unfortunate that that's true.

388
01:01:58,005 --> 01:02:05,210
[SPEAKER_02]: I think what this ordinance is trying to do is to tackle that reality in the best way that we can.

389
01:02:06,651 --> 01:02:08,272
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, I really appreciate it.

390
01:02:08,292 --> 01:02:09,353
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate all the work.

391
01:02:09,933 --> 01:02:13,156
[SPEAKER_02]: I look forward to getting more community feedback.

392
01:02:14,116 --> 01:02:18,657
[SPEAKER_02]: I do believe that this is an issue that we need to tackle.

393
01:02:19,917 --> 01:02:23,618
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's really important for our community that we do tackle it.

394
01:02:24,018 --> 01:02:41,222
[SPEAKER_02]: My one question about this ordinance is related to the idea of a static and unchanging fee versus one that is based on square footage or frontage, you know, linear frontage footage, or any other metric.

395
01:02:42,383 --> 01:02:50,990
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm curious whether there has been any research into just the difference between the largest storefronts and the smallest storefronts.

396
01:02:52,312 --> 01:02:58,177
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe more interesting would be into the currently vacant storefronts.

397
01:02:58,237 --> 01:03:06,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if all of the currently vacant storefronts or typically vacant storefronts fall into a similar category, then maybe that doesn't really matter.

398
01:03:08,406 --> 01:03:16,168
[SPEAKER_02]: But we should always look to the future and ask ourselves, what could it look like if there were a gigantic storefront?

399
01:03:17,609 --> 01:03:27,231
[SPEAKER_02]: Would it matter to them $1,000 or $2,000 or $3,000 versus a very small storefront where that might have more impact?

400
01:03:27,592 --> 01:03:35,814
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm really curious about that aspect and whether that was looked into, what kind of research and data you can provide for us about that piece.

401
01:03:36,888 --> 01:03:53,515
[SPEAKER_08]: What I can say anecdotally about that is that this is a, uh, this is a fee and not a tax so that it would have to be, you can only charge about as, about as much as, um, would be able to fund the database itself.

402
01:03:53,575 --> 01:04:01,858
[SPEAKER_08]: And I feel like if you start to charge by square footage, that's where it starts being like a, you know, more similar to an additional property tax.

403
01:04:01,998 --> 01:04:05,660
[SPEAKER_08]: And it would be unlikely to hold a court Councilor Tseng, I don't know if you have any additional,

404
01:04:06,230 --> 01:04:09,492
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so it's essentially the answer is just legal.

405
01:04:10,132 --> 01:04:12,634
[SPEAKER_01]: We did explore that option.

406
01:04:14,035 --> 01:04:25,562
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically, there's a there's a three part test that the state Supreme Judicial Court sets out for what kinds of fees the city is, what makes a fee a fee and not a tax.

407
01:04:27,443 --> 01:04:28,524
[SPEAKER_01]: And essentially,

408
01:04:30,274 --> 01:04:33,836
[SPEAKER_01]: The first part of the test is about particularized benefit.

409
01:04:33,976 --> 01:04:43,319
[SPEAKER_01]: And the benefit in this case is putting the stuff on a registry so that people can rent out the properties and getting the inspections through it.

410
01:04:43,439 --> 01:04:46,961
[SPEAKER_01]: And that kind of stuff is the benefit.

411
01:04:47,381 --> 01:04:51,083
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's really the registry part is the benefit.

412
01:04:51,223 --> 01:04:52,663
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the first prong of the test.

413
01:04:53,124 --> 01:04:54,484
[SPEAKER_01]: The second prong is voluntariness.

414
01:04:56,825 --> 01:05:05,189
[SPEAKER_01]: In recent years, the Supreme Judicial Court has kind of leaned away and said it's just not really a prong of the test anymore.

415
01:05:05,209 --> 01:05:18,734
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the third part of the test is just the reasonable calculation, congruency, like just making sure that this is proportional to the benefit that they see.

416
01:05:19,435 --> 01:05:20,335
[SPEAKER_02]: That is very helpful.

417
01:05:20,375 --> 01:05:20,855
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks so much.

418
01:05:23,156 --> 01:05:24,537
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Mullane, did you have any

419
01:05:25,314 --> 01:05:27,234
[SPEAKER_08]: Any question or you put your hand down?

420
01:05:29,175 --> 01:05:33,796
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, first of all, thank you again for putting this together.

421
01:05:33,816 --> 01:05:51,199
[SPEAKER_10]: It was really helpful to kind of get a better sense of the direction for an issue that, again, I heard so many times when I was talking with residents in various parts of Medford about wanting to see these vacant properties

422
01:05:51,819 --> 01:05:52,919
[SPEAKER_10]: something being done with them.

423
01:05:54,780 --> 01:06:01,522
[SPEAKER_10]: And I kind of asked my first question around the fee structure, especially when it comes to size of building, so I appreciate that.

424
01:06:02,522 --> 01:06:13,786
[SPEAKER_10]: The other piece of it, Justin, you kind of talked a little bit about the timeline that you had drafted within this in terms of how long people have to kind of

425
01:06:14,186 --> 01:06:21,092
[SPEAKER_10]: respond and be able to, you know, be in contact with the city and what some of those next steps are.

426
01:06:21,112 --> 01:06:28,799
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was just curious, as you were talking, and it looks like your team did a lot of great research and talked to various different areas.

427
01:06:29,339 --> 01:06:31,901
[SPEAKER_10]: How did you come up with this being kind of that structure?

428
01:06:32,062 --> 01:06:39,248
[SPEAKER_10]: And where might you see some flexibility when it comes to or push back one way or the other as you're doing this in terms of the timelines?

429
01:06:40,327 --> 01:06:47,711
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so the timelines that we adopted for the most part come from pretty much what other cities do.

430
01:06:48,752 --> 01:06:52,294
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually the fee calculations too are based on what other cities do.

431
01:06:53,115 --> 01:07:02,820
[SPEAKER_01]: I think for the most part, for each kind of the number of days that you see in the ordinance, other ordinances have the exact same number of days.

432
01:07:04,121 --> 01:07:07,023
[SPEAKER_01]: The one thing that we actually extended the timeline on

433
01:07:07,583 --> 01:07:08,283
[SPEAKER_01]: Or the two things.

434
01:07:08,603 --> 01:07:11,664
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing I mentioned already was the new builds, like new construction buildings.

435
01:07:12,525 --> 01:07:20,027
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something that's special to this version of the ordinance and not to other cities' ordinances, municipalities' ordinances.

436
01:07:20,548 --> 01:07:24,849
[SPEAKER_01]: The second thing that we've extended is just the kind of date it goes into effect.

437
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:29,471
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe in most cities they give them six months.

438
01:07:30,628 --> 01:07:32,430
[SPEAKER_01]: before the ordinance kicks in.

439
01:07:33,430 --> 01:07:58,111
[SPEAKER_01]: In this proposal, the ordinance would only kick in a year after to give property owners the time to learn about the ordinance and how we're gonna enforce it, but also to give city staff more time to develop what the enforcement regime looks like, what the inspections look like, capacity and stuff like that.

440
01:07:59,333 --> 01:08:14,770
[SPEAKER_01]: And this actually brings me to a point that I wanted to talk about a little bit is just a central kind of question for us when we were working on this was how do you create an ordinance that is both future proofed.

441
01:08:16,103 --> 01:08:21,986
[SPEAKER_01]: but also kind of realistic to the capacity of our city government right now.

442
01:08:22,066 --> 01:08:28,810
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's another reason why we've kind of really leaned heavily on the notion of discretion.

443
01:08:30,211 --> 01:08:44,138
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for the most part, we've tried our best to not make too much of this obligatory on the part of city government, at least where it makes sense for us to give that discretion.

444
01:08:47,142 --> 01:08:57,926
[SPEAKER_01]: At the same time, kind of building in capacity, like authorizing things that we would, we might be able to do as a cities.

445
01:08:58,266 --> 01:09:04,128
[SPEAKER_01]: If in five or 10 years, we do see tremendous new growth in the city and we do, hopefully.

446
01:09:06,062 --> 01:09:12,205
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, be able to hire more people in the building department, more people across different city departments.

447
01:09:13,886 --> 01:09:22,250
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a real consideration for us in how we kind of arrived at this notion of discretion in this current ordinance draft.

448
01:09:22,890 --> 01:09:43,345
[SPEAKER_01]: And one other thing, I guess, to answer your question, Councilor Callaghan's question about the legality, the kind of why we set the fee as this and contingent on making it static, is because the Supreme Judicial Court actually has already reviewed similar ordinances, and so we wanted to keep

449
01:09:44,505 --> 01:09:51,250
[SPEAKER_01]: the basic structure of the ordinance similar to what the Supreme Judicial Court signed off on.

450
01:09:52,431 --> 01:09:56,774
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't want to create an ordinance that could be challenged again in court.

451
01:09:57,695 --> 01:10:07,121
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted to really rely on something that's, you know, already been kind of done and dusted and settled and completed.

452
01:10:07,141 --> 01:10:13,566
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any more questions, Councilor Mullen?

453
01:10:14,159 --> 01:10:15,360
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, I appreciate that.

454
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:15,880
[SPEAKER_10]: It's helpful.

455
01:10:15,940 --> 01:10:22,864
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, I think as other people have mentioned too, I'll be interested to hear what other feedback is from the public.

456
01:10:22,964 --> 01:10:36,531
[SPEAKER_10]: And, and again, thanks to you and Matt and to your team putting this all together and really trying to take us to the next level when it comes to figuring out how to combat this issue.

457
01:10:36,691 --> 01:10:37,151
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you.

458
01:10:38,747 --> 01:10:39,547
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.

459
01:10:39,607 --> 01:10:46,569
[SPEAKER_01]: Chair Lemme, I just, I have a kind of three, three more points to short points that I wanted to say.

460
01:10:46,669 --> 01:10:47,389
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah, sure.

461
01:10:48,490 --> 01:10:53,931
[SPEAKER_01]: I was lucky enough last week to be able to speak to the members of the Chamber of Commerce.

462
01:10:54,891 --> 01:10:58,752
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was really interesting hearing the feedback from them about this idea.

463
01:10:59,693 --> 01:11:00,533
[SPEAKER_01]: There really was.

464
01:11:03,053 --> 01:11:10,380
[SPEAKER_01]: I think split is a strong word, but there are a lot of businesses who are actively asking for something like this to be done.

465
01:11:11,441 --> 01:11:19,869
[SPEAKER_01]: I think their evaluation is that vacant properties kind of drive down foot traffic in the squares.

466
01:11:20,750 --> 01:11:25,832
[SPEAKER_01]: that they're in, that it's harder to do business when you have vacant properties around you.

467
01:11:26,673 --> 01:11:34,036
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, the way that it came up in the conversation was they, the businesses brought up if we had looked at this as an idea.

468
01:11:35,537 --> 01:11:40,479
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, at the same time, I have to acknowledge, you know, there are, there were some, there were also businesses.

469
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:54,047
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I think one or two people in the room who weren't as gung-ho about the idea, but they, there was wide agreement on at least in, at the very least inspections and kind of fines and penalty part.

470
01:11:55,307 --> 01:11:59,810
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just, you know, a little bit less, a little bit more skeptical of the fee itself.

471
01:12:00,010 --> 01:12:02,571
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's, you know, there are different views on the issue.

472
01:12:03,851 --> 01:12:18,415
[SPEAKER_01]: And so part of leaning into the inspections part is to signal that, you know, we are listening and that we are kind of at the very least trying to make progress on where we have consensus on the issue in the community.

473
01:12:19,650 --> 01:12:32,328
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I do, um, would also recommend to the committee that we send a draft, um, you know, it might be a draft with with further edits, but we send a draft to KP law for review as well.

474
01:12:32,929 --> 01:12:34,752
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, even though we've had, you know.

475
01:12:36,713 --> 01:12:41,755
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had a well-known professor look at this and review it himself, like that's not the city's legal counsel.

476
01:12:41,855 --> 01:12:47,996
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do think it's important for KP Law to review a draft too.

477
01:12:49,696 --> 01:13:02,340
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just wanted to kind of conclude at least this portion of the meeting by just, again, thanking our city staff for being here for the hard work that they are already doing on this issue.

478
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:03,580
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want that to,

479
01:13:04,365 --> 01:13:04,946
[SPEAKER_01]: go unseen.

480
01:13:06,467 --> 01:13:14,474
[SPEAKER_01]: There has been a lot of work at City Hall, especially from PDS, to try to improve this issue in the city.

481
01:13:14,554 --> 01:13:17,917
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've seen some fruit from that, which is really nice.

482
01:13:19,038 --> 01:13:22,301
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a tough issue to tackle.

483
01:13:22,542 --> 01:13:28,947
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that really, again, underscores the point that it's always helpful to have more tools in the toolbox.

484
01:13:29,948 --> 01:13:49,527
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and that, uh, in developing this ordinance would love, I really would love to hear, um, any, you know, suggestions, um, edits, any kind of feedback from city staff as well, because I, you know, this is, this is a Frankenstein product of, um,

485
01:13:50,288 --> 01:13:55,910
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, individual research, individual ideas, and a lot of what other municipalities around us are doing.

486
01:13:56,430 --> 01:14:06,413
[SPEAKER_01]: But of course, you know, we need to also just listen to City Hall, um, and understand, uh, at the very least, you know, we're gonna move forward with this project.

487
01:14:06,894 --> 01:14:09,674
[SPEAKER_01]: What can we do to make it, um, work better in Manfred?

488
01:14:12,155 --> 01:14:14,036
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

489
01:14:14,056 --> 01:14:17,157
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, gonna move on to taking,

490
01:14:17,987 --> 01:14:19,788
[SPEAKER_08]: questions and comments from city staff.

491
01:14:20,128 --> 01:14:34,114
[SPEAKER_08]: I recognize the Director of the Board of Health, Mary Ann O'Connor, Building Commissioner, Scott VanderWaal, Economic Development Planner, Kayla Myros, Lead Economic Development Director, Sal DeStefano was here for a while, but I'm not seeing him on the Zoom.

492
01:14:35,875 --> 01:14:43,138
[SPEAKER_08]: If y'all have any questions, comments, feedback, input, feel free to raise your hand, or if you don't, that's fine as well.

493
01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:47,240
[SPEAKER_08]: Mary Ann, Director

494
01:14:47,687 --> 01:14:48,748
[SPEAKER_08]: Board of Health Director O'Connor.

495
01:14:49,629 --> 01:14:53,293
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, good evening, and thank you, Councilor Leming and Councilor Tseng for this.

496
01:14:53,874 --> 01:15:01,703
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do think it's, like you said, more tools than a toolbox, and it's going to assist us greatly, I think, in doing our work.

497
01:15:02,564 --> 01:15:07,009
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I do appreciate your comments about discretion as well, certainly.

498
01:15:09,408 --> 01:15:18,773
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the big piece is it's going to give us a lot of assistance with contacting property owners to do the right thing.

499
01:15:19,373 --> 01:15:24,136
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have a hard time quite often, actually, contacting property owners.

500
01:15:24,176 --> 01:15:26,998
[SPEAKER_00]: So this will be a huge help in that respect.

501
01:15:27,898 --> 01:15:33,701
[SPEAKER_00]: I also really appreciate the idea of using some of these vacant properties for community events.

502
01:15:34,362 --> 01:15:38,764
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a wonderful idea, because we certainly need more community spaces.

503
01:15:41,699 --> 01:15:51,368
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only, and the other thing that I really appreciate is the fees and fines being potentials for municipal charges, liens.

504
01:15:52,169 --> 01:15:57,254
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, again, another great tool for us to help us get the work done.

505
01:15:59,116 --> 01:16:00,397
[SPEAKER_00]: My only edits I would,

506
01:16:02,871 --> 01:16:09,899
[SPEAKER_00]: would be to define, when you say a local individual or property manager, to really define what local is.

507
01:16:11,361 --> 01:16:20,531
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in some other ordinance I've seen, you know, it's been like 20, within 20 mile radius or something, you know, so really defining because local to us may be

508
01:16:21,412 --> 01:16:29,017
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing and local to someone else, maybe within the state, you know, so I think defining what that local is would be helpful.

509
01:16:29,998 --> 01:16:36,302
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, I have to get involved with the rats on the on the.

510
01:16:37,863 --> 01:16:43,787
[SPEAKER_00]: Request for a license pest control person to go in and do, I think you have 6 months in there.

511
01:16:43,807 --> 01:16:47,410
[SPEAKER_00]: I would really appreciate monthly pest control reports.

512
01:16:48,133 --> 01:16:53,655
[SPEAKER_00]: only because some of these vacant properties are also attached to other properties that may or may not have issues as well.

513
01:16:53,795 --> 01:16:56,716
[SPEAKER_00]: So that six month could be moved to monthly.

514
01:16:56,756 --> 01:16:58,617
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be really helpful.

515
01:16:59,597 --> 01:17:01,337
[SPEAKER_00]: But other than that, thank you.

516
01:17:03,138 --> 01:17:05,879
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much, Director O'Connor.

517
01:17:07,503 --> 01:17:15,347
[SPEAKER_08]: As I've noted the two suggested edits, we'll go over that in between meetings.

518
01:17:16,167 --> 01:17:22,329
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there anybody else who has any input, feedback, or comments?

519
01:17:22,870 --> 01:17:30,753
[SPEAKER_08]: And happy to take it here, happy to take it offline as well if you would like to discuss these things individually.

520
01:17:30,773 --> 01:17:35,375
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

521
01:17:37,198 --> 01:17:46,540
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing none, are there any members of the public who'd like to chime in?

522
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:59,664
[SPEAKER_08]: I think, yeah, we kind of got overscheduled by the community meeting that's happening in City Hall right now.

523
01:18:02,650 --> 01:18:04,211
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, so, okay, so.

524
01:18:05,191 --> 01:18:13,554
[SPEAKER_08]: In terms of moving this forward, I'm just going to talk about a couple of procedural a couple of procedural items as as Councilor Tseng said.

525
01:18:13,574 --> 01:18:22,177
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, we really need the legal memo from KP law and their analysis for this, uh, that will.

526
01:18:23,257 --> 01:18:23,798
[SPEAKER_08]: Help this.

527
01:18:24,439 --> 01:18:29,424
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently the mayor of East Hampton said that that really helps this to hold this up in court.

528
01:18:31,026 --> 01:18:34,450
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe that can be done from from committee.

529
01:18:34,510 --> 01:18:38,995
[SPEAKER_08]: So we could just we could request that tonight in terms of.

530
01:18:41,672 --> 01:18:51,098
[SPEAKER_08]: In terms of procedure, there's a bit of a weird thing in this ordinance where currently our vacant building ordinance, which this is replacing, is within zoning.

531
01:18:51,799 --> 01:18:56,002
[SPEAKER_08]: And what this is going to do is it's going to take it out of zoning and put it into building codes.

532
01:18:56,442 --> 01:19:01,565
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, zoning changes would need the approval of the Community Development Board first.

533
01:19:02,226 --> 01:19:04,467
[SPEAKER_08]: So essentially, to move this

534
01:19:05,468 --> 01:19:20,136
[SPEAKER_08]: forward, we would basically need to have the full council request a deletion to the entire vacant building ordinance, have them go over that and just have them say, sure, you can delete that or cope with that recommendation.

535
01:19:20,216 --> 01:19:26,459
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't believe that they would be able to comment on the ordinance itself, since that would be outside the zoning, but that replacement, you kind of need to do that.

536
01:19:27,179 --> 01:19:29,019
[SPEAKER_08]: that thing under state law.

537
01:19:29,059 --> 01:19:34,421
[SPEAKER_08]: So there are going to be extra steps to passing this regardless.

538
01:19:35,681 --> 01:19:46,083
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe what I was hearing from multiple members of council was that they'd like to see more community feedback, more community input.

539
01:19:47,263 --> 01:19:55,585
[SPEAKER_08]: And so the option, I kind of see that basically the options for that are move this forward to another

540
01:19:57,046 --> 01:20:04,811
[SPEAKER_08]: meeting and then receive and then, you know, try to receive more public feedback there.

541
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:18,582
[SPEAKER_08]: Or we can refer this to a full council meeting, get the CDB process started and have all members of city council be present for that.

542
01:20:18,742 --> 01:20:27,544
[SPEAKER_08]: And that would also give us a bit more of a forum to try to advertise and get public comment, public comment.

543
01:20:27,604 --> 01:20:30,365
[SPEAKER_08]: And then obviously in between referrals, we could

544
01:20:31,565 --> 01:20:41,872
[SPEAKER_08]: we could implement the changes requested by Director O'Connor as well as some of the things that we've heard from residents since the draft was released.

545
01:20:42,153 --> 01:20:56,503
[SPEAKER_08]: But I would love to hear from other members of the Council whether they think that referring this to the full Council or referring it to another Planning and Permitting Committee meeting in the future is the best next step for this.

546
01:21:00,432 --> 01:21:01,833
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll entertain any motions.

547
01:21:07,217 --> 01:21:08,559
[SPEAKER_07]: Council Vice President Lazzaro.

548
01:21:09,679 --> 01:21:11,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to keep the paper in committee.

549
01:21:11,341 --> 01:21:19,567
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we also have a motion to ask KP Law for a legal analysis and get that started?

550
01:21:19,587 --> 01:21:20,208
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

551
01:21:20,248 --> 01:21:20,468
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

552
01:21:23,372 --> 01:21:25,673
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we have a second on that motion?

553
01:21:25,693 --> 01:21:26,673
[SPEAKER_10]: Second.

554
01:21:27,533 --> 01:21:40,856
[SPEAKER_01]: Could I, I know I'm not a member of the committee, but could we also just, just to cover all our bases, add in to that motion, just letting me continue to edit this, this ordinance draft?

555
01:21:41,097 --> 01:21:50,559
[SPEAKER_03]: And to keep the paper in committee, have Councilor Tseng continue to edit and request legal review from KP Law.

556
01:21:51,669 --> 01:21:56,731
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if we need, do we need an explicit motion to allow them to continue to edit while it's still in committee?

557
01:21:56,751 --> 01:21:57,892
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't think so.

558
01:21:57,912 --> 01:22:00,593
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we've done it before.

559
01:22:00,713 --> 01:22:04,375
[SPEAKER_01]: We've, I just think it's just to cover the bases.

560
01:22:05,135 --> 01:22:06,936
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

561
01:22:08,076 --> 01:22:10,137
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think we do, but we've done it before.

562
01:22:10,157 --> 01:22:10,197
[SPEAKER_01]: So.

563
01:22:10,217 --> 01:22:10,518
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

564
01:22:12,118 --> 01:22:13,099
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

565
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:13,959
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

566
01:22:14,399 --> 01:22:17,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the point of keeping it in committee is like you're working on it.

567
01:22:17,401 --> 01:22:17,541
Yeah.

568
01:22:17,681 --> 01:22:18,521
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

569
01:22:18,921 --> 01:22:20,082
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I would hope so.

570
01:22:20,878 --> 01:22:21,098
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

571
01:22:21,919 --> 01:22:23,000
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, great.

572
