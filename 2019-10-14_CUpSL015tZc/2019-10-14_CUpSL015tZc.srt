00:17:15,918 --> 00:17:17,198
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, you are there.

00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:18,399
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, John.

[SPEAKER_15]: Very good.

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:21,621
[SPEAKER_15]: You snuck.

10
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:22,241
[SPEAKER_15]: We didn't see you.

00:17:24,133 --> 00:17:26,134
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, all please rise and salute our flag, please.

00:17:26,594 --> 00:17:37,140
[SPEAKER_02]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,320
[SPEAKER_15]: DiBenedetto.

26
00:18:14,289 --> 00:18:21,070
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, on page one, it says the gymnastics equipment.

27
00:18:22,191 --> 00:18:23,091
[SPEAKER_14]: What was actually done?

28
00:18:23,131 --> 00:18:24,531
[SPEAKER_14]: Did we replace any equipment?

29
00:18:24,811 --> 00:18:28,052
[SPEAKER_14]: It's $20,000, or was it just cleaning and maintenance?

30
00:18:28,872 --> 00:18:30,673
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, it was a four-floor replacement.

31
00:18:30,753 --> 00:18:31,273
[SPEAKER_14]: That's great.

32
00:18:31,673 --> 00:18:33,713
[SPEAKER_14]: So now it's very safe.

33
00:18:34,153 --> 00:18:35,454
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much for that one.

34
00:18:38,178 --> 00:18:41,379
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, this is the day where you run and you can't catch up anyway.

35
00:18:42,219 --> 00:19:00,045
[SPEAKER_14]: On page two, I don't have the page numbers, NWEA, I just was wondering what those initials stood for because we spent about $5,000 worth of professional technical upgrades.

36
00:19:12,614 --> 00:19:12,954
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

37
00:19:18,217 --> 00:19:18,637
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry.

38
00:19:20,418 --> 00:19:20,838
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

39
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,021
[SPEAKER_14]: No, it's working.

40
00:19:26,442 --> 00:19:27,002
[SPEAKER_14]: Did I bang it?

41
00:19:27,642 --> 00:19:27,942
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry.

42
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:32,145
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't have page numbers.

43
00:19:33,487 --> 00:19:37,188
[SPEAKER_14]: Arctic engineering 30,000 school.

44
00:19:37,288 --> 00:19:37,468
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

45
00:19:37,508 --> 00:19:40,669
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the capital improvements for the HVAC on all the buildings.

46
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:43,830
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry.

47
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:49,311
[SPEAKER_14]: I just, when they're like big amounts, I just like to know what's going down or going on.

48
00:19:49,732 --> 00:19:51,312
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think I only have one more.

49
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:54,113
[SPEAKER_14]: They stuck together.

50
00:19:54,133 --> 00:19:54,173
[SPEAKER_14]: Um,

51
00:20:00,669 --> 00:20:12,632
[SPEAKER_14]: So the math instructional supplies, were they ordered earlier in the year to open up resources and were just being billed now, or are we just purchasing them at this point?

52
00:20:13,192 --> 00:20:17,093
[SPEAKER_13]: These are invoices paid, so we would have received goods prior to this.

53
00:20:17,914 --> 00:20:18,014
[SPEAKER_14]: OK.

54
00:20:18,414 --> 00:20:22,575
[SPEAKER_14]: And my only question was because there was some concern about

55
00:20:24,096 --> 00:20:30,599
[SPEAKER_14]: processing or getting supplies for our math program in the past, and I just wanted to make sure that they had everything they needed.

56
00:20:30,639 --> 00:20:31,800
[SPEAKER_14]: They will have everything that they need.

57
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,060
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep.

58
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:32,780
Okay.

59
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,361
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for your answers.

60
00:20:35,141 --> 00:20:36,182
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Ruggiero.

61
00:20:37,377 --> 00:20:38,499
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mayor Burke.

62
00:20:38,859 --> 00:20:39,580
[SPEAKER_07]: Two quick questions.

63
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:45,909
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to know, so we're all set with all the air compressors and the HVAC, or are we still in process of repairing a number of them all?

64
00:20:46,069 --> 00:20:48,313
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe the majority of the work is complete.

65
00:20:48,573 --> 00:20:48,954
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, great.

66
00:20:49,554 --> 00:20:53,981
[SPEAKER_07]: And what is, this is on page seven, what CDW government

67
00:20:54,660 --> 00:21:03,683
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's technical, we have a couple of memberships for monitoring our internet capacity, so that's a contract service.

68
00:21:04,804 --> 00:21:10,086
[SPEAKER_13]: And or it's technical devices, so computers, laptops, things of that nature.

69
00:21:10,386 --> 00:21:11,146
[SPEAKER_13]: Great, thank you.

70
00:21:11,767 --> 00:21:12,507
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Russo.

71
00:21:14,052 --> 00:21:20,196
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm seeing the unclassified rink expenses for National Grid, and I'm a little embarrassed to ask this question.

72
00:21:20,316 --> 00:21:22,157
[SPEAKER_06]: So the rinks are actually part of the school system?

73
00:21:22,517 --> 00:21:23,617
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a revolving account.

74
00:21:23,637 --> 00:21:24,758
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a revolving account.

75
00:21:24,778 --> 00:21:25,138
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

76
00:21:25,198 --> 00:21:25,438
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

77
00:21:25,698 --> 00:21:27,439
[SPEAKER_15]: So rink fees pay for it.

78
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:28,040
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

79
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:28,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

80
00:21:30,341 --> 00:21:30,661
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

81
00:21:30,721 --> 00:21:30,981
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

82
00:21:31,001 --> 00:21:31,962
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there a motion for approval?

83
00:21:32,925 --> 00:21:35,787
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there a second on the floor by Mr. Ruggiero and Ms.

84
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:36,367
[SPEAKER_15]: Van der Kloot?

85
00:21:36,607 --> 00:21:37,388
[SPEAKER_15]: Roll call vote, please.

86
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:37,468
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

87
00:21:37,548 --> 00:21:38,208
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

88
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:40,269
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

89
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:40,730
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

90
00:21:43,651 --> 00:21:43,871
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

91
00:21:44,612 --> 00:21:44,852
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

92
00:21:44,912 --> 00:21:46,293
[SPEAKER_15]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

93
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:46,973
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

94
00:21:47,013 --> 00:21:47,894
[SPEAKER_15]: Report of secretary?

95
00:21:48,114 --> 00:21:48,314
[SPEAKER_15]: None?

96
00:21:49,055 --> 00:21:49,195
[SPEAKER_15]: None.

97
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:50,796
[SPEAKER_15]: Report of committees.

98
00:21:50,856 --> 00:21:51,656
[SPEAKER_15]: Rules subcommittee.

99
00:21:51,696 --> 00:21:53,257
[SPEAKER_15]: Attendance policy October 1st.

100
00:21:53,457 --> 00:21:53,677
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

101
00:21:53,737 --> 00:21:54,638
[SPEAKER_15]: Kreatz, chairperson.

102
00:22:09,969 --> 00:22:15,272
[SPEAKER_10]: Before I read it, I just want to thank all the administrators for taking time out of their busy schedules to attend the meeting.

103
00:22:15,732 --> 00:22:16,733
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Ms.

104
00:22:16,753 --> 00:22:17,313
[SPEAKER_10]: Toni Wray.

105
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:17,997
[SPEAKER_10]: Ms.

106
00:22:18,017 --> 00:22:19,418
[SPEAKER_10]: Diane Garino, Ms.

107
00:22:19,678 --> 00:22:28,565
[SPEAKER_10]: Lisa Kingsley, Mr. DeLeva, Mr. Tucci, Mr. Cushing, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Downs, Dr. Maurice, Ms.

108
00:22:28,925 --> 00:22:30,346
[SPEAKER_10]: Evangelista, Ms.

109
00:22:30,426 --> 00:22:32,187
[SPEAKER_10]: Emily Lazzaro, Ms.

110
00:22:32,948 --> 00:22:34,229
[SPEAKER_10]: Maureen Lavin, Ms.

111
00:22:34,249 --> 00:22:39,953
[SPEAKER_10]: Joan Bowen, Paulette Van der Kloot attended as well, Mr. Texeria, Diane Caldwell,

112
00:22:40,553 --> 00:22:42,254
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to just thank everybody once again.

113
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:47,899
[SPEAKER_10]: I know how very difficult it is to schedule something like that and I really appreciate you all coming out to attend the meeting.

114
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:54,725
[SPEAKER_10]: The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the attendance policy that's on the MASC website.

115
00:22:55,525 --> 00:23:03,772
[SPEAKER_10]: So we had a great discussion and the members of the subcommittee got to listen to all the concerns that the administration team shared with us.

116
00:23:04,973 --> 00:23:09,477
[SPEAKER_10]: So what we decided was the rules subcommittee members are going to

117
00:23:10,057 --> 00:23:23,467
[SPEAKER_10]: adopt a district-wide policy that's going to be very broad, and we're going to post it on the MASC website, similar to the attendance policy, or we're going to choose one that's similar to either Winchester, Somerville, Concord-Carlisle.

118
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:31,353
[SPEAKER_10]: And my colleague Paul Russo, thank you, Paul, he volunteered to get in touch with the MASC and ask them for their official document.

119
00:23:32,418 --> 00:23:33,879
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you once again, Paul, for doing this.

120
00:23:33,899 --> 00:23:34,739
[SPEAKER_10]: I really appreciate it.

121
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:48,726
[SPEAKER_10]: So after we receive the document, the members of the subcommittee, what we can do is we can work together online with Google Docs and just edit the document to make it fit Medford Public Schools.

122
00:23:49,187 --> 00:23:56,190
[SPEAKER_10]: Then once we have the document ready the way that, you know, we think it looks presentable, we're going to share it with the administrative team.

123
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:59,812
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody except for Paulette that attended the meeting because that would be, you know,

124
00:24:00,573 --> 00:24:03,019
[SPEAKER_10]: That would, you would be, you know, we couldn't do that.

125
00:24:03,621 --> 00:24:03,881
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

126
00:24:03,921 --> 00:24:05,024
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're going to, yeah.

127
00:24:05,766 --> 00:24:08,732
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're not, we're going to share with everybody else except for Paulette.

128
00:24:10,418 --> 00:24:22,943
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I'll call another meeting to schedule another rule subcommittee, and we just have to meet briefly to vote to move it over to the regular subcommittee, regular committee meeting, and everybody can read at that time.

129
00:24:24,464 --> 00:24:31,026
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, and there was one further item that we did decide unanimously during our meeting.

130
00:24:32,787 --> 00:24:38,091
[SPEAKER_10]: There's one sentence that's in the school, not the policies, but procedures.

131
00:24:38,511 --> 00:24:47,818
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a sentence that mentions absent on a Friday, the student may not attend or participate in school functions on that Saturday or Sunday.

132
00:24:48,422 --> 00:24:57,652
[SPEAKER_10]: So at our meeting, we all decided unanimously to redact that sentence from the school district procedures for all schools.

133
00:24:58,133 --> 00:25:06,462
[SPEAKER_10]: And it will be the discretion of the coach to allow a player to participate in a weekend game if the student was absent on a Friday.

134
00:25:07,042 --> 00:25:09,926
[SPEAKER_10]: So that was something that I just wanted to share with everybody.

135
00:25:11,368 --> 00:25:12,590
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's about it.

136
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:17,155
[SPEAKER_15]: So as a procedure, you're recommending to the superintendent to change the procedure.

137
00:25:17,175 --> 00:25:18,377
[SPEAKER_15]: That's not our policy.

138
00:25:18,652 --> 00:25:19,793
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not our policy.

139
00:25:19,873 --> 00:25:21,393
[SPEAKER_10]: And we did talk about that.

140
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:24,975
[SPEAKER_10]: The differences between the policy is very broad.

141
00:25:25,155 --> 00:25:27,236
[SPEAKER_10]: It's one that can fit all schools.

142
00:25:28,357 --> 00:25:32,599
[SPEAKER_10]: But the procedures are individual procedures for each school district.

143
00:25:32,899 --> 00:25:37,021
[SPEAKER_10]: And the four elementary schools have one unique procedure.

144
00:25:37,861 --> 00:25:41,423
[SPEAKER_10]: The two middle schools are working towards having one.

145
00:25:42,644 --> 00:25:45,025
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's all with the school district and administrators.

146
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:47,446
[SPEAKER_10]: And we don't set those procedures, no.

147
00:25:47,944 --> 00:25:48,464
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Ms.

148
00:25:48,484 --> 00:25:48,725
[SPEAKER_15]: Kreatz.

149
00:25:48,745 --> 00:25:49,405
[SPEAKER_10]: You're welcome.

150
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:49,505
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

151
00:25:49,525 --> 00:25:50,005
[SPEAKER_15]: Mustone.

152
00:25:50,926 --> 00:25:51,046
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh.

153
00:25:51,366 --> 00:25:54,389
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I was going to make a motion to suspend rules to take something out of order.

154
00:25:54,409 --> 00:25:54,549
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, OK.

155
00:25:54,689 --> 00:25:54,949
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

156
00:25:55,369 --> 00:25:56,130
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there a motion?

157
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:56,850
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, Ms.

158
00:25:57,211 --> 00:25:57,591
[SPEAKER_15]: Vanderquist?

159
00:25:57,831 --> 00:26:03,815
[SPEAKER_15]: You just hit your button, and then I can pop you right in.

160
00:26:06,818 --> 00:26:11,141
[SPEAKER_09]: So I did attend the meeting because I was the one who had sent it from the floor.

161
00:26:12,101 --> 00:26:14,783
[SPEAKER_09]: And originally, we had sent it to a committee of the whole.

162
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:16,284
[SPEAKER_09]: And then on request, we sent it to

163
00:26:17,528 --> 00:26:21,211
[SPEAKER_09]: the Policy Subcommittee, but I'm not a member, so I wanted to attend, so I did.

164
00:26:22,732 --> 00:26:31,179
[SPEAKER_09]: The other thing that I think was clear from the meeting was that many of the policies that we have posted on the website

165
00:26:32,118 --> 00:26:34,960
[SPEAKER_09]: as Benford Public Schools need to be reviewed and updated.

166
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:48,350
[SPEAKER_09]: That at this time that they were over time, since we originally did it and we worked very, very hard to have it done originally, but it was not updated periodically as we changed policies.

167
00:26:49,611 --> 00:26:59,338
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know exactly when we're gonna get to that, but I believe that it's probably your committee, Kathy, that wants to do that.

168
00:27:00,763 --> 00:27:10,954
[SPEAKER_10]: The superintendent's going to get copies for all the members of the subcommittee so you can start working.

169
00:27:10,974 --> 00:27:18,743
[SPEAKER_10]: The meeting in June and we met several times and we updated several chapters of policies.

170
00:27:19,284 --> 00:27:38,677
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very time consuming, and we met in over many hours in June, and then it was summer break, and then we came back, and we've been meeting, not like in the policy meetings, but then this was set forth to come to the subcommittee, so we have to get back to where we were.

171
00:27:41,399 --> 00:27:44,941
[SPEAKER_10]: We've already begun working on updating the policies,

172
00:27:46,311 --> 00:27:52,067
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it's really time consuming, so we've done, I think we've done like chapters one to...

173
00:27:54,358 --> 00:27:55,579
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, hold on one second.

174
00:27:55,639 --> 00:27:56,839
[SPEAKER_10]: If I could just look at my notes.

175
00:27:56,859 --> 00:27:57,059
[SPEAKER_10]: That's OK.

176
00:27:57,139 --> 00:27:58,039
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I know.

177
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,140
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a work in progress.

178
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,040
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it is.

179
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,801
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just it's quite time consuming.

180
00:28:01,841 --> 00:28:02,601
[SPEAKER_09]: We have been meeting.

181
00:28:02,901 --> 00:28:03,042
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

182
00:28:03,082 --> 00:28:03,302
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

183
00:28:03,342 --> 00:28:03,842
[SPEAKER_15]: VandeKloop.

184
00:28:04,322 --> 00:28:08,224
[SPEAKER_09]: I know how time consuming it is, because I was part of the original putting them together.

185
00:28:08,504 --> 00:28:12,765
[SPEAKER_09]: However, as they're updated, they should be brought to the school committee for their review.

186
00:28:12,965 --> 00:28:13,886
[SPEAKER_09]: We have been.

187
00:28:14,946 --> 00:28:17,827
[SPEAKER_10]: The ones that we already approved in June, we haven't.

188
00:28:18,068 --> 00:28:20,128
[SPEAKER_10]: This one, we haven't approved the policy yet.

189
00:28:20,489 --> 00:28:23,990
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why the meeting we just had, you were in this meeting.

190
00:28:24,584 --> 00:28:26,266
[SPEAKER_10]: We did not approve the policy.

191
00:28:27,367 --> 00:28:30,030
[SPEAKER_10]: Paul is going to obtain.

192
00:28:30,251 --> 00:28:30,811
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand.

193
00:28:30,831 --> 00:28:31,452
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, exactly.

194
00:28:31,532 --> 00:28:35,777
[SPEAKER_10]: But then once we have it and we have it customized, I'm going to bring it forth to the regular meeting.

195
00:28:35,817 --> 00:28:39,461
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't understand that your plan was to review every policy.

196
00:28:39,521 --> 00:28:41,043
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's what I'm suggesting that we do.

197
00:28:41,143 --> 00:28:42,505
[SPEAKER_09]: So clearly, we're on the same page.

198
00:28:42,665 --> 00:28:43,066
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

199
00:28:43,146 --> 00:28:44,868
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, but one at a time.

200
00:28:45,248 --> 00:28:45,368
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

201
00:28:45,388 --> 00:28:48,854
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there a motion to accept this report and place it on file by Ms.

202
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:50,316
[SPEAKER_15]: Kreatz, seconded by Mr. Benedetto?

203
00:28:50,336 --> 00:28:51,117
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

204
00:28:51,718 --> 00:28:52,420
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

205
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,301
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

206
00:28:53,722 --> 00:28:53,922
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

207
00:28:53,942 --> 00:28:56,426
[SPEAKER_15]: Mustone, you're looking for suspension of the rules?

208
00:28:57,875 --> 00:29:03,820
[SPEAKER_15]: She'd like to take paper item number three first, a motion for suspension of the rules, seconded by Mr. Russo.

209
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:04,720
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

210
00:29:05,281 --> 00:29:05,961
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

211
00:29:06,001 --> 00:29:06,742
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion granted.

212
00:29:07,202 --> 00:29:12,366
[SPEAKER_15]: Recommended, I'm sorry, item three, report on PALS, Partnership for Advanced Leadership Skills.

213
00:29:12,827 --> 00:29:15,489
[SPEAKER_15]: Stacey Shulman and Chief Jack Buckley, please rise.

214
00:29:19,812 --> 00:29:20,352
[SPEAKER_15]: Good evening.

215
00:29:23,855 --> 00:29:25,096
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening, long time no see.

216
00:29:29,027 --> 00:29:29,627
[SPEAKER_00]: So where to begin?

217
00:29:29,707 --> 00:29:30,087
[SPEAKER_00]: PALS.

218
00:29:32,028 --> 00:29:44,813
[SPEAKER_00]: When I became chief of police, one of the things that I thought of and one of the goals I wanted to accomplish was to bring the police presence to the schools in a much more impactful way.

219
00:29:45,253 --> 00:29:49,914
[SPEAKER_00]: And we started off first with doing a lot more of the patrols to the schools.

220
00:29:49,974 --> 00:29:55,676
[SPEAKER_00]: And my offices are there every day and night and checking on the schools and being a visible presence around there.

221
00:29:55,696 --> 00:29:57,217
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a safety security type.

222
00:29:57,757 --> 00:30:05,860
[SPEAKER_00]: and it seems to work, but I wanted to see if I could get the officers immersed into the schools a little bit better, or more in depth.

223
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:21,865
[SPEAKER_00]: I want kids as young as kindergarten to fifth grade to be, to look at a police officer in uniform and think of the ways that I did when I was in second grade and went to school and they give you the picture to color the police officer and it was someone there who could help you, someone who was a good presence.

224
00:30:22,385 --> 00:30:27,427
[SPEAKER_00]: Police have taken a bad rap and there are some people who think that the police aren't always there to help you.

225
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:33,830
[SPEAKER_00]: We've come up with this PALS program, and I say we because it really is a partnership.

226
00:30:34,731 --> 00:30:39,793
[SPEAKER_00]: Myself, the superintendent, Stacey Shulman, Diane Caldwell, I approach the schools about

227
00:30:41,468 --> 00:30:56,094
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing the police officers to the schools for purposes of reading to them on a regular basis, to show a human side and teach social emotional skills at the same time, accomplish dual, having lunches, and we're gonna get into this program a little bit better, more.

228
00:30:56,474 --> 00:31:02,356
[SPEAKER_00]: My overwhelming goal once we go beyond the K through five is to go all the way up to the 12th grade.

229
00:31:02,376 --> 00:31:06,878
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we haven't formulated plans for that, but that's what we wanna do is to immerse ourselves into those schools.

230
00:31:08,678 --> 00:31:09,819
[SPEAKER_00]: So Stacey Shulman's with me.

231
00:31:09,879 --> 00:31:12,761
[SPEAKER_00]: She can talk a little bit more about those social emotional learning skills.

232
00:31:13,182 --> 00:31:15,083
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's valuable to have the police.

233
00:31:15,143 --> 00:31:20,306
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's been documented well across this country that the police presence in the schools is very important.

234
00:31:21,667 --> 00:31:24,809
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's that safety security aspect which helps all the time.

235
00:31:24,829 --> 00:31:32,575
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also for the kids, for our youth to learn that the police are there as part of the community in a partnership with them and advance their skills.

236
00:31:35,002 --> 00:31:40,364
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably best at this point if Stacey talks a little bit about the social emotional well-being and then I want to talk about the D.A.R.E.

237
00:31:40,464 --> 00:31:42,164
[SPEAKER_00]: program and some changes there.

238
00:31:43,105 --> 00:31:43,425
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure.

239
00:31:43,545 --> 00:31:45,526
[SPEAKER_12]: So there are three parts to the program.

240
00:31:45,566 --> 00:31:49,787
[SPEAKER_12]: The first is reading books for K through 2 grades.

241
00:31:50,341 --> 00:31:53,444
[SPEAKER_12]: that all have social-emotional learning skill development in them.

242
00:31:54,545 --> 00:32:07,395
[SPEAKER_12]: I provided you with a list early on, but some of the social-emotional learning skills are responsible decision-making, self-awareness, social skills, coping strategies, and social awareness of the community in general.

243
00:32:08,296 --> 00:32:16,783
[SPEAKER_12]: Officers have volunteered on a regular basis to go into all of the elementary school buildings reading the selected book of the month.

244
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:40,687
[SPEAKER_12]: The other element to this is holding social skills lunch groups with students, either by recommended through a good deed by their teacher or perhaps part of their PBIS point system that they would like to use those points to meet with an officer and discuss sort of their role in the community and all of the aspects that we teach in school, which is responsibility, respect, helping others.

245
00:32:41,968 --> 00:32:43,208
[SPEAKER_12]: And the last part of it

246
00:32:43,709 --> 00:32:51,955
[SPEAKER_12]: is to align the drug education, which we had previously used the DARE curriculum, with our social-emotional learning curriculum, the Michigan model.

247
00:32:52,315 --> 00:32:59,801
[SPEAKER_12]: And what that allows us to do is connect the decision-making models together as opposed to having two different, they'll use the one from the Michigan model.

248
00:33:00,121 --> 00:33:01,762
[SPEAKER_12]: It's also an evidence-based program.

249
00:33:03,043 --> 00:33:06,225
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's gonna include training of officers in the Michigan model, correct?

250
00:33:06,245 --> 00:33:11,729
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, so officers will be trained in the Michigan model extensively so that they're both aware of the curriculum and able to teach it effectively.

251
00:33:11,769 --> 00:33:12,150
[SPEAKER_12]: Excellent.

252
00:33:14,544 --> 00:33:16,965
[SPEAKER_00]: Any questions as we move forward?

253
00:33:17,025 --> 00:33:17,485
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

254
00:33:17,545 --> 00:33:18,385
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Ruggiero.

255
00:33:18,405 --> 00:33:21,446
[SPEAKER_07]: I really think this is a great program.

256
00:33:21,526 --> 00:33:23,487
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm really glad that we're doing it in our community.

257
00:33:24,587 --> 00:33:28,689
[SPEAKER_07]: There was something I saw about a month ago on a frontline program, and I wanted to mention it to you.

258
00:33:28,709 --> 00:33:30,149
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if this would help your work.

259
00:33:30,729 --> 00:33:32,290
[SPEAKER_07]: It was about community policing.

260
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:38,932
[SPEAKER_07]: And what they were talking about in the program was how many interactions within some communities with the police is always negative.

261
00:33:39,732 --> 00:33:45,877
[SPEAKER_07]: the police are coming in to often make what has appeared to be difficulties as they solve problems.

262
00:33:46,497 --> 00:33:51,580
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the solutions that this program recommended was for police to offer tickets for good behavior.

263
00:33:52,181 --> 00:34:08,172
[SPEAKER_07]: So if they see children in parks doing something, just like having fun, not loitering, not being destructive, giving tickets for positive behavior and trying to make the interaction with police, especially in communities that have, unfortunately, more interactions with police, more positive.

264
00:34:09,192 --> 00:34:13,777
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't know if that suggestion would help you, but I thought it was a really great idea.

265
00:34:13,797 --> 00:34:29,732
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, I think it was the police department, either Sacramento or Oakland, California, had used this particular program to great effect, to create more community interaction with police in a positive light, rather than, you know, a cop comes to your house because there's a community disruption.

266
00:34:31,657 --> 00:34:46,403
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you, and I've seen some aspects of that going, and that's sort of what we're trying to do here, is to have that friendly interaction, that friendly face, and to make people understand a little bit more who we are, and to get to know the children better ourselves.

267
00:34:46,463 --> 00:34:52,205
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's absolutely something we can look into and move forward, but I've been encouraging my officers all along.

268
00:34:53,225 --> 00:35:00,408
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first started, and a lot of us of my age on the job, we'd be driving down the street, and there'd be a group of kids playing basketball, and you'd be out of the car playing basketball with them.

269
00:35:00,768 --> 00:35:01,728
[SPEAKER_00]: A little thing, right?

270
00:35:01,888 --> 00:35:04,509
[SPEAKER_00]: But it goes a long way with these kids sometimes.

271
00:35:04,949 --> 00:35:08,111
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can stop that in the schools right now, I think it's going to pay off.

272
00:35:09,451 --> 00:35:12,793
[SPEAKER_00]: years down the line for the police department and for the schools.

273
00:35:12,833 --> 00:35:15,074
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, I mean, I mean that in a strong way.

274
00:35:15,114 --> 00:35:16,115
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to benefit us.

275
00:35:16,875 --> 00:35:23,279
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unfortunate that some kids get to see the police in a bad light when we get called to the home at nighttime or at some other point in time.

276
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:29,002
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to show that there's a human side to us and so that we're approachable by these Children.

277
00:35:29,222 --> 00:35:30,123
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Ruther.

278
00:35:30,922 --> 00:35:31,543
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

279
00:35:32,103 --> 00:35:44,697
[SPEAKER_06]: Will there be in this process an evaluation of the performance of the officers in the schools, whether it's feedback from the teachers or maybe occasionally somebody like just going in and monitoring how it goes?

280
00:35:45,514 --> 00:35:46,335
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, absolutely.

281
00:35:46,475 --> 00:35:51,139
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'll go in and guide them along if needed and just spot check with the teachers.

282
00:35:51,179 --> 00:35:54,721
[SPEAKER_12]: But we're also going to be providing a quick survey before and after.

283
00:35:54,962 --> 00:35:55,342
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.

284
00:35:55,362 --> 00:35:55,662
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

285
00:35:55,902 --> 00:35:56,303
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

286
00:35:56,723 --> 00:36:08,813
[SPEAKER_00]: She'll probably kick me afterwards, but I actually think this is a potentially valuable program that if we could ever get a clinical study done to watch these children over the next 5, 10, 15, 20 years of their lives and see maybe what the impact is.

287
00:36:08,873 --> 00:36:08,993
[SPEAKER_00]: But

288
00:36:09,715 --> 00:36:15,477
[SPEAKER_00]: That takes a lot more, so we're going to try to advance the program first and then maybe look at some help from some of the area colleges to do that.

289
00:36:16,077 --> 00:36:16,957
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Benedetto.

290
00:36:16,977 --> 00:36:17,677
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

291
00:36:18,378 --> 00:36:22,219
[SPEAKER_14]: I first wanted to comment on the patrols that go in through those schools.

292
00:36:22,859 --> 00:36:32,782
[SPEAKER_14]: When it first started, there were so many comments from offices on scanners that I was getting phone calls from my neighbors, what's going on at the schools, why are the police always there?

293
00:36:33,462 --> 00:36:39,325
[SPEAKER_14]: And I said, oh, that's just them being visible and more active within our school district.

294
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:41,286
[SPEAKER_14]: And people were very pleased to hear that.

295
00:36:41,746 --> 00:36:42,947
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you for that.

296
00:36:44,068 --> 00:36:47,790
[SPEAKER_14]: And I have some concrete questions about the program, if you don't mind.

297
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:50,131
[SPEAKER_14]: How many officers will be trained?

298
00:36:50,331 --> 00:36:51,772
[SPEAKER_14]: Will they be at all schools?

299
00:36:53,553 --> 00:36:58,155
[SPEAKER_14]: And will the same officers go to the same schools so that they can build relationships?

300
00:36:58,455 --> 00:36:59,856
[SPEAKER_14]: Or will they alternate?

301
00:37:03,749 --> 00:37:09,172
[SPEAKER_00]: As we start, I think I was working with Captain Fowler today and went and pulled some of the officers.

302
00:37:09,232 --> 00:37:14,355
[SPEAKER_00]: We have somewhere in the area of 12 to 16 officers that are going to be trained and to be doing a lot of this stuff.

303
00:37:14,635 --> 00:37:20,079
[SPEAKER_00]: But the hope is that this grows year after year and all of my officers eventually get trained on this.

304
00:37:21,059 --> 00:37:23,760
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, this isn't just something we're going to do this month or this year.

305
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:29,482
[SPEAKER_00]: So ultimately, all of them will get trained sort of in the Michigan model and pushing through.

306
00:37:29,842 --> 00:37:36,225
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as the PALS or DEAR curriculum, we have a core group of officers who historically taught DEAR.

307
00:37:36,245 --> 00:37:38,505
[SPEAKER_00]: There's four or five of them that are going to continue.

308
00:37:38,525 --> 00:37:43,987
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be the same faces every single year for the students to remember.

309
00:37:45,488 --> 00:37:49,190
[SPEAKER_00]: I want this program to have, to have all of my officer to get into school.

310
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:51,472
[SPEAKER_00]: So somehow I don't want to pick one or two or three offices.

311
00:37:51,492 --> 00:37:55,674
[SPEAKER_00]: So they could say, Oh, you know, it's, it's, it's she Buckley, she Buckley, she Buckley.

312
00:37:55,694 --> 00:37:58,576
[SPEAKER_00]: I want them to see and interact with different offices.

313
00:37:59,157 --> 00:38:01,998
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, over time they'll get used to all of us.

314
00:38:02,419 --> 00:38:06,781
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but it won't be when we do the readings and the lunches, it won't be the same officer over and over again.

315
00:38:07,182 --> 00:38:07,502
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

316
00:38:08,002 --> 00:38:13,866
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, and is there any cost involved, um, with, with funding this program to the school district?

317
00:38:15,451 --> 00:38:17,471
[SPEAKER_12]: Not at this time.

318
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:21,132
[SPEAKER_14]: Not at this time, but in the future, you're anticipating any?

319
00:38:21,152 --> 00:38:24,013
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I purchased a good amount of books.

320
00:38:24,053 --> 00:38:27,294
[SPEAKER_12]: So all the books of the month are new purchases for all the school libraries.

321
00:38:27,314 --> 00:38:29,934
[SPEAKER_12]: They'll be able to retain them in the future.

322
00:38:30,574 --> 00:38:33,595
[SPEAKER_12]: We may look to purchasing more books later on.

323
00:38:33,615 --> 00:38:35,895
[SPEAKER_12]: I was able to secure grant funding this time around.

324
00:38:36,195 --> 00:38:36,695
[SPEAKER_14]: That's great.

325
00:38:36,775 --> 00:38:38,016
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for doing that.

326
00:38:38,536 --> 00:38:44,137
[SPEAKER_14]: So I understand your idea of getting all the officers in and through.

327
00:38:44,548 --> 00:38:53,799
[SPEAKER_14]: But in the beginning, I think some consistency for our younger children is to getting to know them, and then switching on a regular basis.

328
00:38:53,879 --> 00:38:55,000
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, now you get a new one.

329
00:38:55,300 --> 00:39:03,810
[SPEAKER_14]: That consistency, especially for some of our students, it takes them time to build relationships that it might be something worth looking at.

330
00:39:04,211 --> 00:39:05,773
[SPEAKER_14]: just as a basic thing.

331
00:39:06,694 --> 00:39:09,136
[SPEAKER_14]: I really like the idea of this program.

332
00:39:09,297 --> 00:39:12,500
[SPEAKER_14]: I am thrilled about it and we get books on top of it.

333
00:39:13,001 --> 00:39:15,043
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a win-win all the way around.

334
00:39:15,483 --> 00:39:18,587
[SPEAKER_14]: I really appreciate the police department's partnership with us.

335
00:39:18,963 --> 00:39:22,345
[SPEAKER_14]: and the social-emotional impact it will have on the children of MedFed.

336
00:39:23,586 --> 00:39:24,086
[SPEAKER_14]: I love it.

337
00:39:24,286 --> 00:39:25,667
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much for bringing it.

338
00:39:25,727 --> 00:39:26,547
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the impact.

339
00:39:26,587 --> 00:39:28,888
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will take that into consideration as we advance.

340
00:39:28,928 --> 00:39:31,310
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I said this is going to advance year after year.

341
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:32,330
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to look into it.

342
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:33,111
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to study it.

343
00:39:33,131 --> 00:39:35,312
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to try to keep everyone informed about this.

344
00:39:35,332 --> 00:39:38,273
[SPEAKER_00]: And that might be one of the areas that we find we'll have to concentrate on.

345
00:39:38,534 --> 00:39:38,774
[SPEAKER_10]: Ms.

346
00:39:38,794 --> 00:39:38,994
[SPEAKER_10]: Kritz.

347
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:43,614
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I want to thank you for this report, and I think it's a great partnership.

348
00:39:43,634 --> 00:39:45,276
[SPEAKER_10]: It sounds so exciting.

349
00:39:46,016 --> 00:39:57,308
[SPEAKER_10]: So I wanted to know, is there still going to be, I know they used to have the day of graduation for the students, and the parents were invited and very excited to attend and watch the ceremony, and is that still going to happen, something like that?

350
00:39:57,768 --> 00:40:00,451
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, so we will keep the ceremony aspect of it.

351
00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:02,633
[SPEAKER_12]: It will instead be just called a PALS graduation.

352
00:40:02,953 --> 00:40:10,100
[SPEAKER_12]: We're planning on having t-shirts as well, perhaps including a contest where students can draw the logo for it on what PALS means to them.

353
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:11,041
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

354
00:40:11,081 --> 00:40:11,461
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

355
00:40:11,521 --> 00:40:11,962
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

356
00:40:12,542 --> 00:40:12,782
[SPEAKER_12]: Ms.

357
00:40:12,802 --> 00:40:13,243
[SPEAKER_15]: Van der Kloot.

358
00:40:13,932 --> 00:40:27,075
[SPEAKER_09]: I, too, just wanted to add my thanks to both of you, and I particularly appreciated, as I read the part about sort of revamping the DARE education to now fit within the Michigan model.

359
00:40:27,815 --> 00:40:34,596
[SPEAKER_09]: That includes vaping education as well, and I think that's something that we're all concerned about.

360
00:40:34,976 --> 00:40:38,457
[SPEAKER_09]: So I was really glad to see that that was articulated in here as well.

361
00:40:39,037 --> 00:40:40,758
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it's a wonderful idea.

362
00:40:40,798 --> 00:40:47,142
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that I used to run lunch bunches, and I know how valuable they can be for kids.

363
00:40:47,542 --> 00:40:48,663
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a little bit relaxed.

364
00:40:48,683 --> 00:40:49,804
[SPEAKER_09]: They look forward to it.

365
00:40:50,544 --> 00:40:55,147
[SPEAKER_09]: And having a police officer as a friendly face in the room, I think, is a wonderful idea.

366
00:40:55,207 --> 00:40:56,308
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you very much.

367
00:40:56,328 --> 00:40:57,649
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

368
00:40:58,349 --> 00:40:59,049
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much.

369
00:40:59,069 --> 00:41:03,072
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there a motion to receive this report and place it on file?

370
00:41:04,398 --> 00:41:15,324
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion seconded by Mr. Giro all those in favor all those opposed motion passes Thank you very much both of you and team Medford and all the administrators that played a role in Creating this so we look forward to it.

[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

372
00:41:15,744 --> 00:41:16,164
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

373

375
00:41:37,794 --> 00:41:38,234
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

376
00:41:40,617 --> 00:41:41,538
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening, everyone.

377
00:41:43,279 --> 00:41:45,642
[SPEAKER_01]: So Medford High School students visited the opera.

378
00:41:46,703 --> 00:41:56,012
[SPEAKER_01]: Last week, students taking Italian at Medford High School attended Pagliacci, an Italian opera composed by Ruggiero Leoncavallo.

379
00:41:57,295 --> 00:42:00,937
[SPEAKER_01]: Leading up to the performance, students learned about the story of Pagliacci.

380
00:42:01,617 --> 00:42:07,380
[SPEAKER_01]: Pagliacci is a wonderful opera full of romance, betrayal, madness, and vengeance.

381
00:42:08,781 --> 00:42:11,162
[SPEAKER_01]: This was such a great opportunity for our students.

382
00:42:12,023 --> 00:42:18,066
[SPEAKER_01]: Our world language department always tries to teach cultural enrichment along with teaching languages.

383
00:42:19,747 --> 00:42:25,730
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of middle school, middle school sports, I just wanted to follow up and keep you in the loop on what's happening with our

384
00:42:26,137 --> 00:42:27,618
[SPEAKER_01]: middle school sports programming.

385
00:42:28,178 --> 00:42:32,920
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently, the Mustangs all have winning records.

386
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:40,702
[SPEAKER_01]: Boys and girls cross country are three and zero, softball is three and two, and baseball is four and one.

387
00:42:41,263 --> 00:42:47,205
[SPEAKER_01]: Congratulations to the coaches and athletes for their strong performances straight out of the gate.

388
00:42:50,272 --> 00:43:01,986
[SPEAKER_01]: I would also like to just update you that Dr. Stacey Mulligan, our grade 10 assistant principal, also took on the role this year of diversity and inclusion coordinator for the Medford Public Schools.

389
00:43:03,167 --> 00:43:05,170
[SPEAKER_01]: Her plan over the course of this school year

390
00:43:06,364 --> 00:43:13,169
[SPEAKER_01]: will be to work with central office, faculty, and staff to help address the needs of our diverse school district.

391
00:43:13,830 --> 00:43:29,461
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Mulligan plans to conduct a few new initiatives this year, including instituting implicit bias, cultural proficiency training district-wide, hosting a four-part symposium series discussing race and education,

392
00:43:30,485 --> 00:43:34,048
[SPEAKER_01]: in establishing the Medford Chapter of ALANA Educators.

393
00:43:34,569 --> 00:43:39,273
[SPEAKER_01]: And ALANA stands for African, Latino, Asian, and Native American.

394
00:43:40,254 --> 00:43:47,781
[SPEAKER_01]: Last Thursday, the ALANA hosted their first monthly gathering at Salvatore's in Medford, Medford Square.

395
00:43:48,022 --> 00:43:55,629
[SPEAKER_01]: At the event, educators discussed best practices and shared expertise, as well as discussed options for career advancement.

396
00:43:56,590 --> 00:44:00,674
[SPEAKER_01]: We all appreciate Dr. Mulligan's leadership on these important issues.

397
00:44:02,136 --> 00:44:02,997
[SPEAKER_01]: The McGlynn School.

398
00:44:03,598 --> 00:44:10,765
[SPEAKER_01]: The McGlynn third graders received a visit from the Medford Rotary Club, who provided students with dictionaries and bookmarks.

399
00:44:11,666 --> 00:44:12,167
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition,

400
00:44:12,922 --> 00:44:22,464
[SPEAKER_01]: The Medford Kiwanis Club made financial donations to CCSR, the Mustang Cheerleaders, and the Mustang Athletic Department.

401
00:44:23,144 --> 00:44:30,326
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Medford Public Schools appreciates the continuing support that these service clubs provide to our students.

402
00:44:32,827 --> 00:44:33,847
[SPEAKER_01]: Back at the middle schools.

403
00:44:35,447 --> 00:44:38,288
[SPEAKER_01]: Last week, along with Mayor Burke and Dr. Cushing,

404
00:44:39,105 --> 00:44:45,106
[SPEAKER_01]: I attended the first of the Greater Boston PFLAG presentations, which was held at the Andrews Middle School.

405
00:44:45,887 --> 00:44:50,568
[SPEAKER_01]: This presentation will also be held at the McGlynn Middle School and Medford High School.

406
00:44:52,208 --> 00:45:03,011
[SPEAKER_01]: The eighth graders learned about the importance of making sure all people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer are valued as part of the Andrews community.

407
00:45:03,711 --> 00:45:08,332
[SPEAKER_01]: The students were encouraged to always be kind, supportive, and inclusive to all.

408
00:45:09,362 --> 00:45:11,442
[SPEAKER_01]: Schools should be a safe place for our students.

409
00:45:12,163 --> 00:45:19,204
[SPEAKER_01]: We thank CCSR and the Foundation Trust Grant for bringing this important and informative presentation to our schools.

410
00:45:21,004 --> 00:45:26,205
[SPEAKER_01]: The McGlynn 8th graders participated in a field trip to learn about the college process.

411
00:45:27,286 --> 00:45:29,706
[SPEAKER_01]: Tufts University hosted the students.

412
00:45:30,246 --> 00:45:34,087
[SPEAKER_01]: The admissions office made a presentation and students could ask questions.

413
00:45:34,698 --> 00:45:43,181
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the students were taken on a tour of the campus and they were able to eat lunch at Tufts University in a cafeteria at Tufts University.

414
00:45:43,761 --> 00:45:55,285
[SPEAKER_01]: Principal Tucci had the students prepared for this field trip by having teachers discuss their college experiences with them during their wind walk on college day at the McGlynn.

415
00:45:55,758 --> 00:45:57,019
[SPEAKER_01]: which was on October 2nd.

416
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:59,641
[SPEAKER_01]: It was an excellent opportunity for them.

417
00:46:00,102 --> 00:46:06,827
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to thank Tufts University for their generosity in agreeing to engage our young students.

418
00:46:08,568 --> 00:46:15,354
[SPEAKER_01]: I also just want to remind everyone that Medford Public Schools continues to provide free breakfast for all students.

419
00:46:15,974 --> 00:46:23,320
[SPEAKER_01]: It is our hope that all students will take advantage of this opportunity and start the day with a healthy breakfast.

420
00:46:24,541 --> 00:46:25,062
[SPEAKER_01]: Lastly,

421
00:46:25,715 --> 00:46:28,237
[SPEAKER_01]: Yom Kippur begins tomorrow at sundown.

422
00:46:28,917 --> 00:46:31,079
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the holiest day of the Jewish year.

423
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:36,603
[SPEAKER_01]: I extend all good wishes to all of our Jewish friends as they begin this solemn holiday.

424
00:46:37,784 --> 00:46:38,184
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

425
00:46:38,324 --> 00:46:39,065
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much.

426
00:46:40,086 --> 00:46:40,426
[SPEAKER_00]: Ms.

427
00:46:40,466 --> 00:46:41,006
[SPEAKER_15]: Vandekloot.

428
00:46:45,702 --> 00:46:53,284
[SPEAKER_09]: Superintendent, I was wondering if you could let the school committee know when the next PFLAG presentation will happen at the McGlynn.

429
00:46:53,344 --> 00:46:55,884
[SPEAKER_09]: So would it be possible for us to attend?

430
00:46:55,944 --> 00:46:57,464
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that something that would be OK?

431
00:46:57,504 --> 00:46:59,185
[SPEAKER_15]: There's two more at the Andrews.

432
00:46:59,285 --> 00:46:59,525
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

433
00:46:59,545 --> 00:47:03,666
[SPEAKER_15]: If I'm not mistaken, for seventh and then sixth grade, and then the McGlynn is next.

434
00:47:03,786 --> 00:47:06,206
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get the official dates and send them out to you.

435
00:47:06,466 --> 00:47:06,666
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

436
00:47:06,846 --> 00:47:07,166
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

437
00:47:07,206 --> 00:47:08,427
[SPEAKER_09]: And it would be OK if we attended?

438
00:47:08,767 --> 00:47:08,987
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

439
00:47:09,407 --> 00:47:09,627
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

440
00:47:10,447 --> 00:47:10,727
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

441
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:12,187
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

442
00:47:13,908 --> 00:47:14,588
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Benedetto.

443
00:47:15,149 --> 00:47:15,509
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

444
00:47:15,569 --> 00:47:16,650
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for the updates.

445
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:19,191
[SPEAKER_14]: I really like hearing everything going on.

446
00:47:20,012 --> 00:47:33,339
[SPEAKER_14]: It also reminded me about when you mentioned the free breakfast, I was at a meeting last week and a parent came up to me and said the middle school bus was getting there three minutes before the time to go to class.

447
00:47:33,719 --> 00:47:38,202
[SPEAKER_14]: So there's really no time for those students to go and get a free breakfast before the bell.

448
00:47:39,543 --> 00:47:49,948
[SPEAKER_14]: So could we look at- Yeah, I'm gonna follow up with transportation to try to figure out what- All buses, let's just check to make sure kids are there early enough to have their free breakfast.

449
00:47:49,968 --> 00:47:51,369
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we'll definitely do that.

450
00:47:51,589 --> 00:47:58,872
[SPEAKER_14]: It didn't affect this particular family, but it just brought to light that some kids who might need breakfast

451
00:47:59,891 --> 00:48:02,113
[SPEAKER_14]: really need to be there early enough so they can have it.

452
00:48:02,213 --> 00:48:08,940
[SPEAKER_14]: And if not, then some way those children should be allowed to have their breakfast, even if it's after the bell or somehow.

453
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:09,761
[SPEAKER_14]: I will look into it.

454
00:48:10,021 --> 00:48:10,442
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

455
00:48:10,462 --> 00:48:10,782
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

456
00:48:10,802 --> 00:48:11,523
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate that.

457
00:48:11,663 --> 00:48:14,086
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. Ruggiero.

458
00:48:15,011 --> 00:48:22,117
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, in terms of the free breakfast program, I've been hearing a couple of issues I just wanted to clarify with you.

459
00:48:23,238 --> 00:48:27,322
[SPEAKER_07]: So are these just like cereals that we're offering or what?

460
00:48:27,382 --> 00:48:30,404
[SPEAKER_07]: They're pretty, they're robust.

461
00:48:30,544 --> 00:48:34,788
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to ask Assistant Superintendent Christine Patterson to come forward.

462
00:48:34,848 --> 00:48:38,852
[SPEAKER_01]: She has all of the details, but it definitely is more than cereal.

463
00:48:39,052 --> 00:48:39,212
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

464
00:48:40,276 --> 00:48:45,979
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, this initiative has gone full scale, and we are offering a hot option at every school building.

465
00:48:46,439 --> 00:48:50,782
[SPEAKER_13]: So that is part of our intent to get participation.

466
00:48:51,262 --> 00:49:02,208
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, after the three month pilot, you will have a full comprehensive report on the counts and the ability to continue or revisit the actual program.

467
00:49:02,228 --> 00:49:06,131
[SPEAKER_13]: But we are doing full scale hot breakfast options.

468
00:49:06,371 --> 00:49:07,771
[SPEAKER_13]: We do have a new chef.

469
00:49:09,078 --> 00:49:16,285
[SPEAKER_13]: kitchen manager at the high school level, and he is doing scratch cooking for the breakfast, so we are trying to encourage participation.

470
00:49:16,366 --> 00:49:21,291
[SPEAKER_13]: The high school does have the most time in the morning, so we are also including signage.

471
00:49:21,891 --> 00:49:29,839
[SPEAKER_13]: This has been a full-scale intent to get student participation for free breakfast, so it has been

472
00:49:31,312 --> 00:49:35,213
[SPEAKER_13]: everybody in their best efforts to get that happening.

473
00:49:35,553 --> 00:49:41,835
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I know the report is not officially out yet, but could you give us a sense of what the participation rate is, just a ballpark figure?

474
00:49:42,775 --> 00:49:48,396
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that we have seen increases since the start of school, but they're not to the extent that we need them.

475
00:49:48,676 --> 00:49:49,616
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, thank you.

476
00:49:50,377 --> 00:49:51,557
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. Russo.

477
00:49:53,157 --> 00:49:53,477
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

478
00:49:54,678 --> 00:49:55,698
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I know, like,

479
00:49:56,565 --> 00:49:57,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Transportation's always an issue.

480
00:49:58,607 --> 00:49:59,708
[SPEAKER_06]: Too much of your time, I'm sure.

481
00:49:59,748 --> 00:50:07,153
[SPEAKER_06]: But this morning, the Andrews bus got in, I believe, at 810, which is long after breakfast would have been done.

482
00:50:07,374 --> 00:50:13,779
[SPEAKER_06]: Does the kitchen staff, is there a process where the kitchen staff knows, OK, now you can

483
00:50:14,883 --> 00:50:43,949
[SPEAKER_13]: stop or did they like get 805 stop so the the bus this morning was a fluke issue it was an illness of one of the drivers they scrambled to get somebody so the the hope you know there is traffic issues and somewhat that hold it up but we have been adamant that all of the buildings that when the buses arrive that they are allowed to disembark the bus and go in for breakfast in the cafeteria immediately so that has been

484
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:46,832
[SPEAKER_13]: the directive to all the building principals.

485
00:50:47,092 --> 00:50:50,795
[SPEAKER_13]: And to my knowledge, they have been exercising that.

486
00:50:50,835 --> 00:50:51,776
[SPEAKER_13]: We did have an issue.

487
00:50:52,156 --> 00:50:55,119
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that we do have some issues with the MBTA buses.

488
00:50:55,639 --> 00:50:59,242
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, we're trying to provide alternate options.

489
00:50:59,322 --> 00:51:02,705
[SPEAKER_13]: But again, we can only do so much to provide a meal.

490
00:51:03,005 --> 00:51:04,766
[SPEAKER_13]: The students still have to come in and take it.

491
00:51:05,667 --> 00:51:11,412
[SPEAKER_13]: And even if it's a late bus, or a late arrival, or if they're able to come in to some extent.

492
00:51:11,432 --> 00:51:12,393
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

493
00:51:14,588 --> 00:51:15,028
[SPEAKER_15]: Very good.

494
00:51:15,628 --> 00:51:19,290
[SPEAKER_15]: Next up, recommendation to approve field trip to Argentina.

495
00:51:19,370 --> 00:51:20,490
[SPEAKER_15]: Mrs. Lepore.

496
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:25,852
[SPEAKER_15]: And Ms.

497
00:51:25,952 --> 00:51:26,593
[SPEAKER_15]: Boller.

498
00:51:26,613 --> 00:51:31,334
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, there's already a motion on the floor.

499
00:51:31,374 --> 00:51:33,175
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there a motion on the floor for approval?

500
00:51:33,655 --> 00:51:33,895
[SPEAKER_15]: And Ms.

501
00:51:33,915 --> 00:51:35,636
[SPEAKER_15]: DiVanadotto, is there a second?

502
00:51:36,416 --> 00:51:37,197
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

503
00:51:37,277 --> 00:51:37,777
[SPEAKER_15]: Prats.

504
00:51:38,177 --> 00:51:38,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that was easy.

505
00:51:38,737 --> 00:51:39,237
[SPEAKER_02]: It's up to you.

506
00:51:44,503 --> 00:51:45,224
[SPEAKER_15]: Sounds amazing.

507
00:51:45,624 --> 00:51:46,305
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it is.

508
00:51:46,566 --> 00:51:50,230
[SPEAKER_08]: This is my third attempt to try to do the trip.

509
00:51:50,310 --> 00:51:55,937
[SPEAKER_08]: I tried back when 9-11 happened and the trip was canceled, logically.

510
00:51:57,155 --> 00:51:59,156
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we tried one more time.

511
00:51:59,476 --> 00:52:01,177
[SPEAKER_08]: And this time it seems to have taken.

512
00:52:01,797 --> 00:52:02,998
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we're really excited.

513
00:52:03,018 --> 00:52:07,800
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the long flight has probably been a factor also.

514
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:10,281
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a 10 hour flight from New York City.

515
00:52:10,941 --> 00:52:14,743
[SPEAKER_08]: So I know that that has swayed the students and the families.

516
00:52:15,283 --> 00:52:21,506
[SPEAKER_08]: The expense, we have paid, I'm sure you were able to look over the papers.

517
00:52:22,066 --> 00:52:23,587
[SPEAKER_08]: The cost of the trip is 3,900, 39,

518
00:52:27,338 --> 00:52:54,963
[SPEAKER_08]: 40, I know some of the trips to Europe have cost that, especially the April trips, but this one is exceptionally expensive because of the flights, and we're also gonna be flying to Iguazu Falls, which is the largest waterfalls in the world, and it borders Brazil, so there will be a flight, and we will be staying overnight there, and there will be activities that we're going to be doing there, also a cooking lesson and things that are being planned.

519
00:52:55,803 --> 00:53:10,228
[SPEAKER_08]: The field rep that is representing Vamonos Tours is traveling October 25th to fine tune the itinerary that you have in front of you, so there might be some changes, but one of the changes in particular that I'm working on

520
00:53:10,721 --> 00:53:14,004
[SPEAKER_08]: is visiting a high school instead of an elementary school.

521
00:53:14,884 --> 00:53:21,629
[SPEAKER_08]: When I took the students to Madrid and Barcelona, we went to a high school, and that was an incredible experience for the students.

522
00:53:22,170 --> 00:53:25,752
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're still keeping in touch with some of the students they met there.

523
00:53:26,293 --> 00:53:27,934
[SPEAKER_08]: And we spent half a day there, too.

524
00:53:27,954 --> 00:53:29,215
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't just an hour.

525
00:53:29,836 --> 00:53:30,696
[SPEAKER_08]: And we had lunch.

526
00:53:30,716 --> 00:53:33,058
[SPEAKER_08]: They had lunch for the students.

527
00:53:33,458 --> 00:53:37,962
[SPEAKER_08]: And they were able to spend time with the students without us, and we spent time with the teachers.

528
00:53:38,642 --> 00:53:41,124
[SPEAKER_08]: So, it was a great experience.

529
00:53:42,125 --> 00:53:44,447
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if you have any questions about the trip.

530
00:53:45,608 --> 00:53:47,469
[SPEAKER_15]: I think there's a motion on the floor for approval.

531
00:53:47,589 --> 00:53:48,610
[SPEAKER_15]: Roll call vote please.

532
00:53:58,784 --> 00:54:00,705
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

533
00:54:00,765 --> 00:54:01,606
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

534
00:54:01,626 --> 00:54:03,368
[SPEAKER_15]: Keep us posted.

535
00:54:03,848 --> 00:54:07,391
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll come back and give you some tango lessons when we get back.

536
00:54:07,431 --> 00:54:07,912
[SPEAKER_08]: Please do.

537
00:54:07,932 --> 00:54:08,752
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

538
00:54:09,173 --> 00:54:09,693
[SPEAKER_01]: Have fun.

539
00:54:09,713 --> 00:54:10,374
[SPEAKER_15]: Bye bye.

540
00:54:10,894 --> 00:54:11,595
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

541
00:54:13,677 --> 00:54:16,059
[SPEAKER_15]: OK, report on building and grounds.

542
00:54:16,239 --> 00:54:17,460
[SPEAKER_15]: Security update.

543
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:19,021
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. McLaughlin.

544
00:54:22,785 --> 00:54:23,145
[SPEAKER_15]: Kramer.

545
00:54:30,124 --> 00:54:30,304
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

546
00:54:31,385 --> 00:54:34,966
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening, Mayor Burke, Superintendent, and School Committee.

547
00:54:36,027 --> 00:54:43,951
[SPEAKER_11]: So, as you know, buildings and grounds does take a high stake in the security of our school district.

548
00:54:44,791 --> 00:54:54,176
[SPEAKER_11]: Over the last few years, I've been very active in the process of walking through our buildings with Lieutenant Covino, auditing the district, and assessing our needs.

549
00:54:56,012 --> 00:55:03,594
[SPEAKER_11]: I have also worked to help the technology upgrades as well as camera management and landscaping.

550
00:55:04,814 --> 00:55:19,658
[SPEAKER_11]: For over a year, I've been working with the district wide security commission that is comprised of strategic personnel, the method police, and we're trying to create a security foundation to move forward on.

551
00:55:21,561 --> 00:55:34,745
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of the items that we're currently in the process of revising are designated parking at a high school complex for students working collaboratively with the city engineer to expand parking options at the high school.

552
00:55:34,805 --> 00:55:38,346
[SPEAKER_11]: So basically what we're trying to do is we're trying to find some more parking.

553
00:55:38,366 --> 00:55:40,207
[SPEAKER_11]: There's issues definitely on the weekends.

554
00:55:40,307 --> 00:55:42,367
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a lot of things we can do.

555
00:55:43,608 --> 00:55:50,490
[SPEAKER_11]: We can maybe take an island out here and there and expand parking in that particular way.

556
00:55:51,250 --> 00:55:58,859
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're also obtaining the pricing because we're going to be looking into our communication systems, our two-way radio systems.

557
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:03,384
[SPEAKER_11]: We're trying to get unity throughout the district.

558
00:56:04,185 --> 00:56:08,270
[SPEAKER_11]: Right now, every school does have communication systems.

559
00:56:08,807 --> 00:56:12,690
[SPEAKER_11]: that are working, but we're just trying to make it that much better.

560
00:56:13,530 --> 00:56:19,534
[SPEAKER_11]: That way we'll all be able to communicate and there'll be no, you know, you go into one radio.

561
00:56:20,675 --> 00:56:24,077
[SPEAKER_11]: Each system right now has their own frequency that they operate on.

562
00:56:24,957 --> 00:56:32,022
[SPEAKER_11]: And then one of the biggest things that's really, really good is we're going to be doing the see something, say something app.

563
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:44,128
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a phone app and it's going to be students and staff where they can anonymously report things that they feel they want to report.

564
00:56:44,148 --> 00:56:44,968
[SPEAKER_11]: They can report anything.

565
00:56:45,008 --> 00:56:52,473
[SPEAKER_11]: They can report a broken window, they can report whatever they see the need to report.

566
00:56:52,493 --> 00:57:01,239
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that that's something that's going to work out well and we're going to be hopefully rolling that out around in January.

567
00:57:02,325 --> 00:57:05,828
[SPEAKER_11]: So we'll see how that goes and we'll certainly update some more.

568
00:57:06,789 --> 00:57:12,014
[SPEAKER_11]: So we want to be transparent in what we're up to.

569
00:57:12,094 --> 00:57:22,943
[SPEAKER_11]: We can't always say what we're up to, but we do want to try to let the community know that we are busy, we are working, we are trying to make updates.

570
00:57:23,870 --> 00:57:32,874
[SPEAKER_11]: We do have a plan, we do have a list, but we just can't get into the specifics because it just wouldn't do anybody any good for us to do that.

571
00:57:33,474 --> 00:57:35,375
[SPEAKER_11]: We do a lot already.

572
00:57:35,835 --> 00:57:38,617
[SPEAKER_11]: As you know, we have the Raptor systems in place.

573
00:57:38,677 --> 00:57:40,798
[SPEAKER_11]: We have monitors at doors.

574
00:57:41,758 --> 00:57:45,420
[SPEAKER_11]: We're very conscious of people coming in and out of buildings.

575
00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:52,463
[SPEAKER_11]: Now I know at the high school we've made some updates where not only do you sign a person in,

576
00:57:54,044 --> 00:57:58,086
[SPEAKER_11]: but you actually call the destination that they're going to.

577
00:57:58,146 --> 00:58:06,170
[SPEAKER_11]: So that way the person that they're going to meet is expecting them and can be waiting for them or in the hallway or whatever they need to do.

578
00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:16,295
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're continuously trying to improve on a system that we already have that's pretty good.

579
00:58:16,755 --> 00:58:19,396
[SPEAKER_11]: So I can take any questions if you wish.

580
00:58:21,695 --> 00:58:22,195
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, sir.

581
00:58:22,716 --> 00:58:23,116
[SPEAKER_06]: My pleasure.

582
00:58:23,936 --> 00:58:30,139
[SPEAKER_06]: The see something, say something app, do all the reports end up in one giant pile for you?

583
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:34,082
[SPEAKER_11]: Or is it- Well, I would assume that it's going to go back to a designated person.

584
00:58:34,102 --> 00:58:49,069
[SPEAKER_11]: I would assume that in that person would disseminate where the next destination would be, which I would assume a principal or the headmaster for more, so that they can look into it.

585
00:58:50,350 --> 00:58:52,871
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I said, it could be a buildings and ground issues, this comes to me.

586
00:58:53,351 --> 00:58:54,132
[SPEAKER_11]: It could be anything.

587
00:58:54,232 --> 00:58:57,653
[SPEAKER_11]: It could honestly be any issue that somebody decides.

588
00:58:57,693 --> 00:59:01,215
[SPEAKER_11]: It's almost like, is that the 311 system?

589
00:59:01,235 --> 00:59:05,397
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, the C-Click fix, it's sort of on that idea.

590
00:59:06,717 --> 00:59:13,040
[SPEAKER_06]: After it's up, even for just 30 days, can we, I don't need a gory detailed report or anything, but just like

591
00:59:13,608 --> 00:59:15,829
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you get six reports or did you get 5,000?

592
00:59:16,049 --> 00:59:16,309
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

593
00:59:16,609 --> 00:59:18,149
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

594
00:59:18,169 --> 00:59:24,592
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that's, yeah, that's absolutely, you know, I mean, we're going to roll it out and hopefully, you know, put it this way.

595
00:59:24,652 --> 00:59:26,552
[SPEAKER_11]: If we don't get anything, that's a good thing.

596
00:59:27,332 --> 00:59:31,234
[SPEAKER_11]: If we do and we're able to avert something, that's a good thing as well.

597
00:59:31,254 --> 00:59:32,434
[SPEAKER_15]: Does it have a blog attached to it?

598
00:59:34,075 --> 00:59:34,695
[SPEAKER_15]: Just a warning.

599
00:59:35,535 --> 00:59:36,575
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. Russo.

600
00:59:37,616 --> 00:59:38,316
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Benedetto.

601
00:59:38,938 --> 00:59:39,318
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

602
00:59:39,418 --> 00:59:47,065
[SPEAKER_14]: First of all, I'd like to thank you for all the security measures you put in place with yourself and all of the people working at our buildings.

603
00:59:47,105 --> 00:59:49,927
[SPEAKER_14]: The lighting changes, the camera changes.

604
00:59:50,407 --> 00:59:51,628
[SPEAKER_14]: You're very responsive.

605
00:59:51,668 --> 00:59:53,170
[SPEAKER_14]: Your department has been excellent.

606
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:56,853
[SPEAKER_14]: And not just now, but you've always

607
00:59:57,551 --> 00:59:58,532
[SPEAKER_14]: done a great job.

608
00:59:58,652 --> 00:59:59,353
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

609
00:59:59,453 --> 00:59:59,834
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

610
01:00:00,655 --> 01:00:12,408
[SPEAKER_14]: At this point I'd like to make a motion for this committee to move forward with studying the security director position so that way when we have this app in place we have someone to

611
01:00:13,549 --> 01:00:15,891
[SPEAKER_14]: actually answer that in security measures.

612
01:00:16,351 --> 01:00:25,919
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that we had put it forward last year in conjunction with the city position, but since that didn't get approved, I would like to move forward.

613
01:00:25,979 --> 01:00:27,300
[SPEAKER_14]: I think this is imperative.

614
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:30,002
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we should have this in place for next school year.

615
01:00:30,422 --> 01:00:32,624
[SPEAKER_14]: So I need one of my colleagues to second the motion.

616
01:00:32,904 --> 01:00:34,324
[SPEAKER_15]: To add it as a budget request?

617
01:00:34,605 --> 01:00:34,865
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

618
01:00:35,185 --> 01:00:35,725
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the goal?

619
01:00:36,545 --> 01:00:36,725
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep.

620
01:00:36,905 --> 01:00:37,926
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there a second by Ms.

621
01:00:37,966 --> 01:00:38,166
[SPEAKER_15]: Kritz?

622
01:00:38,186 --> 01:00:38,286
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

623
01:00:39,026 --> 01:00:44,988
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion to add this item as a budget request as part of this paper, it can be debated during the budget process.

624
01:00:45,068 --> 01:00:46,749
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not automatic.

625
01:00:46,769 --> 01:00:46,809
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

626
01:00:47,049 --> 01:00:49,570
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, thank you.

627
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:51,110
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

628
01:00:51,170 --> 01:00:51,830
[SPEAKER_15]: Van der Kloot.

629
01:00:52,330 --> 01:00:55,071
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to thank you, too, for your efforts.

630
01:00:55,792 --> 01:00:58,773
[SPEAKER_09]: I was curious a little bit just about the parking.

631
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:02,521
[SPEAKER_09]: So it sounds like we need more parking spaces.

632
01:01:03,341 --> 01:01:05,542
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that because more students are driving to school?

633
01:01:05,782 --> 01:01:06,903
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I think a lot.

634
01:01:08,324 --> 01:01:10,625
[SPEAKER_11]: Honestly, your parking issues.

635
01:01:13,610 --> 01:01:15,050
[SPEAKER_11]: I wouldn't call them huge issues.

636
01:01:15,431 --> 01:01:20,112
[SPEAKER_11]: I would say that on the weekends, it's more of an issue than it is during the week.

637
01:01:20,492 --> 01:01:24,213
[SPEAKER_11]: But we also wanted to try to consolidate student parking.

638
01:01:24,633 --> 01:01:27,074
[SPEAKER_11]: And that way, we can have the students in one section.

639
01:01:27,494 --> 01:01:30,815
[SPEAKER_11]: And that way, we know that the staff is another section.

640
01:01:30,975 --> 01:01:41,158
[SPEAKER_11]: And so we really wanted to disseminate it that way, where we had areas that are recognized for certain parking situations.

641
01:01:41,418 --> 01:01:42,899
[SPEAKER_09]: Which is the area for student parking?

642
01:01:43,299 --> 01:01:46,502
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, normally, I mean, we used to call it back in the day the tennis court.

643
01:01:47,202 --> 01:01:56,550
[SPEAKER_11]: So the front left-hand side of the building, you know, out front, there's great coverage out there, camera coverage out there.

644
01:01:57,031 --> 01:01:59,292
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll work out, you know, it'll work out nice.

645
01:02:00,718 --> 01:02:13,694
[SPEAKER_11]: I know the headmaster of the labor at the high school has been working on a plan as well where he's been handing out, I believe he might be handing out some passes, different passes, and just to get a handle on who's up there, who's parking up there.

646
01:02:14,515 --> 01:02:18,340
[SPEAKER_11]: We've done it in the past a few times, so we just wanted to reach.

647
01:02:18,784 --> 01:02:22,087
[SPEAKER_11]: institute what's been happening with the parking.

648
01:02:22,107 --> 01:02:30,233
[SPEAKER_11]: But if there is a parking situation, it's more towards the weekends with the field and the rentals running at the same time.

649
01:02:30,253 --> 01:02:31,995
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

650
01:02:36,767 --> 01:02:37,488
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Ruggiero.

651
01:02:37,808 --> 01:02:39,370
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mayor Burke.

652
01:02:39,550 --> 01:02:40,572
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much for the report.

653
01:02:40,612 --> 01:02:42,714
[SPEAKER_07]: You've done a great job trying to keep this stuff up.

654
01:02:42,974 --> 01:02:45,317
[SPEAKER_07]: My one concern is- Well, it's not just me, by the way.

655
01:02:46,278 --> 01:02:48,041
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a lot of pieces to it.

656
01:02:48,101 --> 01:02:50,123
[SPEAKER_11]: I could never sit here and take the credit myself.

657
01:02:50,363 --> 01:02:50,684
[SPEAKER_07]: Fair enough.

658
01:02:50,924 --> 01:02:51,244
[SPEAKER_11]: Fair enough.

659
01:02:52,205 --> 01:02:56,107
[SPEAKER_07]: I do have one little concern to sort of branch off what Member Ruseau was talking about.

660
01:02:56,167 --> 01:02:57,648
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see something, say something out.

661
01:02:58,629 --> 01:03:01,530
[SPEAKER_07]: That phrase carries a police connotation to me.

662
01:03:01,570 --> 01:03:06,333
[SPEAKER_07]: When I hear that, I think I see something on a subway that looks suspicious, and I'm going to report it.

663
01:03:06,953 --> 01:03:11,075
[SPEAKER_07]: But my concern is that it's going to go into one giant bucket.

664
01:03:11,335 --> 01:03:20,400
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's going to be the broken light, linoleum that's a little warped, with what could be a serious security concern in that same place.

665
01:03:22,041 --> 01:03:26,206
[SPEAKER_11]: I certainly don't think that it's going to be that way myself personally.

666
01:03:26,226 --> 01:03:32,453
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know that myself and other administrators, we do take it serious.

667
01:03:35,667 --> 01:03:37,729
[SPEAKER_11]: We live and we learn every day.

668
01:03:37,789 --> 01:03:38,870
[SPEAKER_11]: We see things every day.

669
01:03:40,552 --> 01:03:44,316
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't really have a concern that it wouldn't be taken lightly like that.

670
01:03:44,376 --> 01:03:47,879
[SPEAKER_11]: I just don't, I just can't see it in this day and age.

671
01:03:47,919 --> 01:03:48,340
[SPEAKER_11]: You know?

672
01:03:49,981 --> 01:03:54,566
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not just because of the way you were describing it a second ago.

673
01:03:54,786 --> 01:03:57,789
[SPEAKER_07]: What I'm trying to say is I apologize.

674
01:03:57,809 --> 01:03:58,610
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not trying to

675
01:03:59,697 --> 01:04:07,841
[SPEAKER_11]: to make it seem like, I'm just trying to say it can be used for any connotation, whether it's somebody that sees something that they want to report correctly.

676
01:04:07,901 --> 01:04:08,441
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, right.

677
01:04:08,461 --> 01:04:10,242
[SPEAKER_07]: And a light is a security measure.

678
01:04:10,462 --> 01:04:10,662
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

679
01:04:10,742 --> 01:04:13,583
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to make sure that we're going to be able to separate the signal from the noise.

680
01:04:13,783 --> 01:04:18,486
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, obviously a broken light is important, but a suspicious bag is more important.

681
01:04:18,546 --> 01:04:19,566
[SPEAKER_11]: And even at first,

682
01:04:21,948 --> 01:04:25,490
[SPEAKER_11]: The person that came to explain it to us said, yeah, you're going to get that.

683
01:04:25,870 --> 01:04:30,753
[SPEAKER_11]: The first month or so, you're going to get all frivolous stuff.

684
01:04:31,174 --> 01:04:31,694
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean?

685
01:04:31,754 --> 01:04:37,718
[SPEAKER_11]: But you also, people like myself, people like Kirsten, people that have to

686
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:40,709
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, be the front runners on that stuff.

687
01:04:40,729 --> 01:04:41,569
[SPEAKER_11]: Take it serious.

688
01:04:41,689 --> 01:04:42,269
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, we do.

689
01:04:42,509 --> 01:04:42,789
[SPEAKER_11]: We do.

690
01:04:43,129 --> 01:04:43,229
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

691
01:04:43,249 --> 01:04:43,349
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

692
01:04:43,369 --> 01:04:44,170
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

693
01:04:44,190 --> 01:04:44,650
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

694
01:04:44,690 --> 01:04:46,631
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Russo, one more?

695
01:04:47,511 --> 01:04:54,974
[SPEAKER_06]: I just have a question about, so, you know, the weekend traffic situation, which, I mean, this is only my second year here, but I think we talk about it every other meeting.

696
01:04:55,834 --> 01:05:07,418
[SPEAKER_06]: At one point last year, we talked about the issue of, you know, when we were talking about bringing Leslie in as a partner, there were some concerns around parking.

697
01:05:08,462 --> 01:05:22,586
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of the things that we talked about was whether or not events are being scheduled, you know, right up to 12, and then the next event scheduled at 12, which means you need twice as much parking than either event themselves need.

698
01:05:23,186 --> 01:05:26,027
[SPEAKER_06]: And so my question is, and I think we had talked about it when we went

699
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:37,942
[SPEAKER_06]: really into the weeds around the various scheduling apps that the school system has, are we still scheduling something that goes until 12 and then something else starts at 12?

700
01:05:38,642 --> 01:05:41,702
[SPEAKER_06]: Or are we giving half-hour breaks between every event?

701
01:05:41,722 --> 01:05:42,442
[SPEAKER_12]: It's probably a 10-minute break.

702
01:05:43,263 --> 01:05:50,984
[SPEAKER_06]: Because a 10-minute break isn't enough for a basketball game to get out, everybody to get... For the fields, I'm not talking inside.

703
01:05:51,064 --> 01:05:57,405
[SPEAKER_15]: For the fields, it's usually you go up to 50 minutes, 10 of the hour, and then something new starts at the hour.

704
01:05:57,994 --> 01:06:02,437
[SPEAKER_06]: And everybody coming in at 12, they're there at 20 of.

705
01:06:03,618 --> 01:06:10,063
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is not just an issue of like, we can take down the fells and build parking if we want.

706
01:06:10,083 --> 01:06:10,983
[SPEAKER_06]: No, we can't.

707
01:06:11,103 --> 01:06:13,765
[SPEAKER_04]: And we won't.

708
01:06:14,065 --> 01:06:21,290
[SPEAKER_06]: My point is just like, we can solve this in a way other than just adding more parking spots.

709
01:06:22,551 --> 01:06:24,873
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, it does require that we take away

710
01:06:25,393 --> 01:06:29,016
[SPEAKER_06]: a small number of minutes a day when the facilities are used.

711
01:06:29,436 --> 01:06:31,297
[SPEAKER_06]: But it just seems like an easy fix.

712
01:06:32,418 --> 01:06:39,223
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, granted, I realize that sports are scheduled out like a year or two in advance, so it's an easy fix that might take a year or two to happen.

713
01:06:39,483 --> 01:06:41,384
[SPEAKER_15]: In high school, sports aren't limited to an hour.

714
01:06:41,864 --> 01:06:47,288
[SPEAKER_15]: They go until they're done, which is different than someone renting the field is the 50-minute hour.

715
01:06:47,765 --> 01:06:51,827
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, so I mean, I just feel like this is something we could do to bring this down.

716
01:06:51,847 --> 01:06:59,550
[SPEAKER_06]: Because honestly, I can't believe the fire and police don't say anything to us about what it's like there on a Saturday.

717
01:07:00,231 --> 01:07:01,031
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just not.

718
01:07:01,331 --> 01:07:02,091
[SPEAKER_15]: They go through.

719
01:07:02,351 --> 01:07:02,732
[SPEAKER_06]: They do.

720
01:07:02,772 --> 01:07:04,753
[SPEAKER_06]: They might go through, but you can't drive through.

721
01:07:04,773 --> 01:07:06,333
[SPEAKER_11]: You can't get in or out.

722
01:07:06,353 --> 01:07:07,874
[SPEAKER_11]: I see them all the time.

723
01:07:07,894 --> 01:07:11,896
[SPEAKER_11]: At the beginning, it's gotten a lot better recently.

724
01:07:11,936 --> 01:07:16,978
[SPEAKER_11]: But at the beginning of September, there were some renters that were very unhappy when they came out.

725
01:07:17,472 --> 01:07:23,777
[SPEAKER_11]: And they found that they had tickets, I think, what were they, $100 tickets or something like that for parking in the fire lanes.

726
01:07:26,219 --> 01:07:26,640
[SPEAKER_11]: And I mean.

727
01:07:26,740 --> 01:07:28,541
[SPEAKER_15]: And that skating park has helped a little bit.

728
01:07:28,581 --> 01:07:30,303
[SPEAKER_15]: Because they've used that now for parking.

729
01:07:30,323 --> 01:07:31,864
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's alleviated a little bit.

730
01:07:31,904 --> 01:07:35,167
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I mean, everybody wants to get as close to the door as they can.

731
01:07:35,227 --> 01:07:36,788
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean?

732
01:07:37,328 --> 01:07:45,095
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's one of the, I mean, Medford High School is such a large building that it's like, you have to be so

733
01:07:46,517 --> 01:07:59,444
[SPEAKER_11]: conscious of how you open doors and such because, you know, you can't tell somebody to park at the skate park and then go down to the front door because it's 800 yards away, you know what I mean?

734
01:07:59,504 --> 01:08:01,465
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like a quarter of a mile walk, you know?

735
01:08:01,485 --> 01:08:08,189
[SPEAKER_11]: So you really have to cater and you really have to be, you know, about what doors that you have open to make it convenient for people.

736
01:08:09,370 --> 01:08:14,913
[SPEAKER_11]: But there's plenty of parking, you'll always find a spot, you know, during the week up in the skate park, there's probably six,

737
01:08:16,068 --> 01:08:17,449
[SPEAKER_11]: 20 spots open at all times.

738
01:08:18,170 --> 01:08:18,590
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

739
01:08:19,011 --> 01:08:19,791
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

740
01:08:20,652 --> 01:08:20,992
[SPEAKER_15]: All set?

741
01:08:22,593 --> 01:08:29,218

742

[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, good evening, everyone.

747
01:08:42,260 --> 01:08:44,022
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to give you a brief update.

748
01:08:44,922 --> 01:08:45,723
[SPEAKER_01]: It's October.

749
01:08:45,823 --> 01:08:46,824
[SPEAKER_01]: We are up and running.

750
01:08:47,004 --> 01:08:56,071
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only are we going to be conducting learning walks this year at all elementary schools, we have rolled it up through all of the schools.

751
01:08:56,592 --> 01:09:06,640
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pleased to announce that many of you will be joining us for at least one of the mathematical learning walks to see what the work looks like.

752
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:09,502
[SPEAKER_01]: Leslie will continue to partner with us

753
01:09:10,441 --> 01:09:23,307
[SPEAKER_01]: And we will be using the five core actions, continuing that work, building a common language amongst teachers, administrators, and the central office team to do that work.

754
01:09:23,887 --> 01:09:38,274
[SPEAKER_01]: So just wanted to let you know, the month of October, we are gathering our baseline data, and I look forward to updating you on how we do with the end of those learning walks, and hearing your feedback as well.

755
01:09:38,652 --> 01:09:39,372
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Ruggiero.

756
01:09:40,012 --> 01:09:45,774
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mayor Burke, and thank you very much for your commitment to improving our math curriculum.

757
01:09:46,254 --> 01:09:53,256
[SPEAKER_07]: I would just like to suggest, as you're walking through, if we can get an update on how you feel like our ELL instruction in the math environment is doing.

758
01:09:54,197 --> 01:09:57,658
[SPEAKER_07]: As I voiced earlier today, it's an area I think is of concern.

759
01:09:58,498 --> 01:10:10,510
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would be very interested to hear about your thoughts in this regard about how we, because I think, you know, the reason why we're suffering in our percentages is this one, a couple of areas, and that's one of them.

760
01:10:11,025 --> 01:10:17,907
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we definitely will be looking at EL, not only our EL students, we'll be looking at our students with disabilities.

761
01:10:18,468 --> 01:10:27,531
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll also, during the walks, have an opportunity to look at full-size classrooms and some smaller classroom settings.

762
01:10:27,571 --> 01:10:37,414
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do want to be able to report out on what our subgroups are doing as well, so that we have a well-balanced view of what's happening in the district.

763
01:10:38,054 --> 01:10:38,314
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

764
01:10:38,354 --> 01:10:38,634

767
01:10:49,215 --> 01:10:58,478
[SPEAKER_14]: I did notice on the back of requested reports, at our last meeting, I requested an update on math supplies, materials, and consumables.

768
01:10:58,799 --> 01:11:04,581
[SPEAKER_14]: Would you just add that to the list of reports with the school committee dates?

769
01:11:04,997 --> 01:11:08,119
[SPEAKER_14]: Since we were talking about math blocks, I thought it was appropriate at that time.

770
01:11:08,359 --> 01:11:08,960
