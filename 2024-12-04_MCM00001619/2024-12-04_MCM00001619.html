    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=0.691">The</a>  public meeting of the City of Medford Liquor License Commission for 11-20-24 will come to order. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=10.037">We</a>  do have an agenda to follow. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=13.199">There</a>  are no minutes from last month, so we're going to move right on to the first item on the agenda, which is event, and I see Brian here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=26.652">So,</a>  Brian, tell us a little bit about what's going on.</p>

    <p>[Bryan MacAuslan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=30.735">Great.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=31.695">Actually,</a>  I have two applications, and one is a collaboration. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=36.598">Is</a>  this the collaboration with Cuisine and Locale, or is this the... Yes.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=42.722">Great.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=43.303">So...</a>  We can do yours first, the event, then one, and then Cuisine and Locale after, second.</p>

    <p>[Bryan MacAuslan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=49.667">Great.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=50.087">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=51.228">So,</a>  let's see, Friday, December 6th, if I'm correct. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=55.417">beer</a>  and board games. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=56.698">We</a>  basically, we do games here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=59.16">We've</a>  done this before and basically we invite the community, local businesses, people to come to a free event and they can play games and the bar would be open for beer and wine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=72.89">We</a>  did it, I think around, maybe around this time last year and it was really good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=77.013">We</a>  set up a bunch of tables and yeah, it was just something for people to do and come out for. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=82.957">So</a>  we're actually doing, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=84.878">3</a>  gaming events that weekend, um, the, uh, the Saturday and Sunday, we will not be serving alcohol. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=90.944">Um,</a>  but we thought the Friday 1 would be good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=93.267">Uh,</a>  the, the Friday and the Saturday and Sunday are video game. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=97.111">And</a>  so those don't really, um. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=100.754">It's</a>  not really an interest in it, so the Friday we would be interested in it for the beer and board games.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=106.14">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=107.528">That</a>  sounds good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=109.409">You</a>  always do a good job. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=111.089">I'm</a>  sure we've got the insurance on file. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=115.111">Do</a>  you have just like an annual insurance for this?</p>

    <p>[Bryan MacAuslan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=117.812">We</a>  do, but I usually pull a one day additional liquor liability on it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=124.535">So</a>  once we get the application, I usually just send it over.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=126.936">Yeah,</a>  if you can send that over to Daria, that'd be great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=133.362">Okay,</a>  and we know where you always serve your alcohol. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=136.845">It's</a>  always the same, so same layout. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=141.129">Allen,</a>  do you have any questions for Brian?</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=143.01">No.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=143.871">No,</a>  Mr. Chairman. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=144.792">I</a>  was going to say the same thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=147.474">I</a>  remember this event last year, and Brian has the insurance on record in the diagram, so we're good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=155.201">I'm</a>  comfortable with this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=157.123">I</a>  don't have any questions for Brian. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=159.825">Great.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bryan MacAuslan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=161.645">And</a>  I'm here for most, pretty much 90% of any event that we do that has alcohol, so. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=168.427">I'll</a>  take it any chance.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=171.749">I</a>  know it's in good hands at that point.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=175.77">Okay,</a>  you want to make a motion? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=177.811">Yeah,</a>  I'll make a motion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=179.711">I</a>  motion to approve the one-day license for Event Dam to be held on December 6th from 7 to 10 p.m.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=191.605">All</a>  righty, and I'll second that motion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=194.507">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=195.868">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=196.588">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=197.209">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=198.429">Hearing</a>  and seeing none, the ayes have it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=200.651">You're</a>  all set with that one, Brian. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=202.512">Great,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=203.673">You're</a>  welcome. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=204.693">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=205.374">Let's</a>  go to the next. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=207.535">That's</a>  for...

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=794.796">Yep.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=795.256">Do</a>  you want to just kind of give us a little description about what's going on, where you're going to be serving the liquor, where the bar's going to be set up, is it all going to basically be the same, you know?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=806.834">Yeah,</a>  it's pretty much all going to stay the same. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=808.836">We're</a>  just adding a little bit of liquor to the function room bar. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=811.459">In</a>  the future or not, if I'm going to do anything in the restaurant, the actual restaurant, I might do a small menu and just run out of the function room possibly. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=819.969">Mostly</a>  for the function room because we get a lot of <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=827.758">The</a>  clients that come in, they'd want something more than beer and wine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=830.34">So,</a>  it's like we find that it's kind of, yeah, it's a little bit of a struggle sometimes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=833.883">I</a>  even have people like back out because they're realizing that the full lick is not in play. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=838.407">So,</a>  they just try to... So, it's kind of costing us a little bit right now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=843.252">So,</a>  I mean, again, like a small menu, just something to offer and, you know.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=848.862">Now,</a>  I've been to a couple of functions there, and it's a good size room. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=854.024">Do</a>  you know what the seating capacity is in it? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=856.245">I</a>  think we hold 100. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=857.766">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1234.318">Then</a>  she did the applicant statement, Susan Schultz, she signed it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1238.383">She</a>  signed again, yep. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1239.764">You</a>  do all of that stuff, that was correct. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1242.668">But</a>  then she, then the query was fine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1245.431">And</a>  then, I don't know where they got this page, it says number 12, manager application. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1250.236">It's</a>  basically got the same information on it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1253.94">that</a>  the one that he didn't sign has, only this one he signed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1260.384">I</a>  think they took it out of a new application or something. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1267.829">That</a>  would make sense now that you say that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1269.55">It</a>  kind of like cut and paste it, I think.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1271.851">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1273.292">So</a>  I, you know, I just, it's not a big deal. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1275.977">I'm</a>  just letting you know in case the ABCC kicks it back. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1280.444">Well,</a>  they will kick it back to them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1281.926">So</a>  yeah, we'll have them corrected. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1284.37">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1284.951">I</a>  mean, it was fine.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1289.256">I</a>  wonder if they realized they made a mistake, and that's why they did that page again and had Mr. Jones sign it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1296.883">He</a>  could have. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1297.884">He</a>  could have. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1298.284">I</a>  wonder.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1299.004">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1299.605">I</a>  was just going to suggest that if they were here today, because I didn't know what went on last month. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1305.35">I</a>  wasn't here, but if they were scheduled to be here today, I was just going to tell them to just correct the papers and send the whole packet out to Daria. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1314.798">instead</a>  of just the one page, because I know it's a pain for Daria to try and rescan everything and take stuff out of a PDF that's got five, six pages. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1324.64">It's</a>  craziness. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1325.981">So</a>  when we have people correct stuff, I'm going to start telling them, send the whole package corrected. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1332.442">Do</a>  you usually get them on a PDF, Daria, with all the things on one page? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1338.463">Or</a>  do they just mail them to you?</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1341.463">Sometimes</a>  it really depends. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1343.828">Some</a>  people are very top-notch, get everything together for me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1349.198">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1350.778">once</a>  everything is ready. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1352.458">Some</a>  give me pieces by pieces and that's where it becomes a pain in the butt because then I don't, I just don't have time to.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1358.919">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1360.44">So</a>  they don't drop, they don't come to City Hall and drop off? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1362.68">Sometimes</a>  they do. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1363.44">It</a>  depends. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1363.84">Some</a>  of them do. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1365.121">And</a>  some of them just scan it in and send the whole PDF?</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1368.941">Yeah,</a>  most of them do send me the original and I'll ask, I will tell them, can you send me the original please? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1374.922">But</a>  they will also send me the emailed version.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1378.623">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1380.216">Yeah,</a>  that'll be good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1381.037">Just</a>  so you don't have to go crazy if you got to do any corrections and if they got to do any corrections and stuff.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1388.267">Yes,</a>  so I was going to email Ocean State job lot. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1393.085">And</a>  I said, hello, no one appear in front of the Liquor License Commission for a change in manager application today. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1399.43">The</a>  application will be tabled. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1401.412">Should</a>  I tell them the next meeting, special meeting, or should we just have them come for December? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1407.817">Come</a>  for December. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1408.818">That's</a>  fine.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1409.618">Just</a>  to change a manager. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1410.879">I</a>  mean, it's not a big deal.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1413.962">Because</a>  I confirmed twice. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1416.924">I</a>  emailed, I followed up because nobody responded to me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1421.257">I</a>  just want to make sure that they received it and then they applied and said that Ralph Kimber, which I think is the proposed manager, will be in attendance.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1431.685">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1432.626">But</a>  that was November 6th.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1436.829">We</a>  can push that to December. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1439.151">I</a>  think that's fine.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1441.873">I</a>  think our special meeting is going to be long. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1448.524">And</a>  I spoke with Ralph today because I had a couple of questions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1458.858">He</a>  said, they notify, he says, you folks notified them that there are four different incidents, four different violations. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1470.569">I</a>  says, I'm not sure how we notified them, to be honest with you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1474.973">I</a>  know we notified them to appear. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1476.734">And</a>  he says, yeah, he says, you gotta notify them that they have to appear for four separate violations. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1485.618">He</a>  says, each one of them, you're going to read individually. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1491.501">When</a>  you read them individually, at that point, if you want to set what they're going to have to have for a violation punishment, you got to do it for each one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1507.228">And</a>  he kind of explained to me basically the way that it works and how we progress every violation, the next violation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1518.552">He</a>  explained to me how it should progress. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1522.934">He</a>  also said before we send out the notification that we're going to be <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1531.042">hearing</a>  all four violations at the same day, we've got to put times in. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1536.425">If</a>  it's noon, first violation, 12 o'clock. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1539.807">Second</a>  violation, 12.15. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1540.787">Third</a>  violation, 12.45. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1542.188">Fourth</a>  violation, 1 o'clock. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1547.823">And</a>  it got to be hand-delivered by Rory to make sure he gets it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1553.765">He</a>  said, also, you want to run it by KP law to make sure we get the right language in there in case it needs to be polished up a little. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1561.867">I</a>  told him about the signage for the window. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1574.822">And</a>  he said just, he says, that's beautiful, that's good, you wanna do that, he said, but run that by KP Law too in case it needs to be polished a little bit. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1586.692">And</a>  what was, just remind me, what was the signage? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1590.375">The</a>  signage in the window is just basically telling them that, telling the public. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1599.022">Consumer,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1600.643">It's</a>  gotta be displayed eye level, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1603.458">on</a>  the inside of the glass so people can read it from outside. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1606.599">I</a>  can basically read it without the name. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1616.684">Name</a>  of the business is prohibited from selling any products containing alcohol per order of the Method License Commission. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1624.233">from</a>  such-and-such-a-date to such-and-such-a-date due to liquor license suspension for violation of Mass General Law, Chapter 138, Section 34, sale, delivery, or furnishing of alcoholic beverages to persons under 21 years of age. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1641.945">And</a>  then in small letters down the bottom, I put, the store may resume normal hours of operation on December 1st. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1649.23">I</a>  shouldn't, such-and-such-a-date. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1654.749">He</a>  also advised me on how we should, you know, we can have the hearings and after each violation hearing, we can set the, not the fine, the punishment for it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1677.726">And</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1681.485">Once</a>  that's done, we get into the next one and then we set. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1686.213">the</a>  punishment for that one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1688.034">And</a>  we get another one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1689.736">And</a>  that way, it progresses. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1693.058">Because</a>  it's, as you can see in our things, it goes in steps. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1696.54">First</a>  violation, you know, warning, second violation, one day suspension. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1701.524">And</a>  these are all major. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1703.045">They're</a>  not, they're all major.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1706.267">So</a>  it sounds like what you're saying is that we have to treat each infraction individually. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1710.771">That</a>  is correct. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1712.712">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1713.412">And</a>  so we, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1715.48">We</a>  know what occurred, and we hear their side of the argument, and then we ask questions, and then we come to some resolution with that one, and then we go to the next one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1732.086">Do</a>  we give each one <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1736.693">20</a>  minutes, 30 minutes, because you had mentioned there has to be a timeframe on the agenda.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1742.541">Yeah,</a>  I mean, that's what Ralph said. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1745.024">He</a>  was saying, yeah, the first one could be 12, then 1230, then Monday. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1749.068">But</a>  I don't think we need a half hour for each one.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1752.072">No,</a>  no.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1753.093">Some</a>  might be quick. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1754.535">Some</a>  might be longer. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1755.596">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1756.397">You</a>  can do them 10 minutes apart if you want. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1758.88">If</a>  it goes a little longer, it goes a little longer. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1761.402">It's</a>  not a big deal. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1763.625">It's</a>  just kind of like a <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1770.695">a</a>  couple of little tweaks that he wanted, which were good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1774.439">I'm</a>  glad I gave him a call because the reason why I called him was because of the incident with the porch that we're having. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1783.428">I</a>  don't know if you are aware of it, Alan, but the new owners that are going to be going into the porch, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1792.348">can't</a>  get in because the porch never surrendered their license. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1795.75">The</a>  license, I'd heard that, yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1798.011">So</a>  there's options. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1803.815">Ralph</a>  gave me two, three different options. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1807.017">Can't</a>  they wait for the end of the year till it expires? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1809.218">That</a>  is the best option for them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1813.181">Only</a>  he says, if it's extreme and they really want to get in there any, well, not any earlier, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1822.853">but</a>  they can withdraw their application. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1826.794">So</a>  now they're not applying for a Section 12 license, so they can get a one-day license to have in there, and because they already have the lease secured. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1840.918">But</a>  he says the bad thing about that is, is if <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1846.062">Um,</a>  he says they're going to have to re-advertise to all the abutters when they reapply. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1853.464">They</a>  won't have to pay the $200 fee again, but they're going to have to re-advertise. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1857.865">They're</a>  going to have to put it in the paper. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1860.765">And</a>  I'm saying, that's going to take them longer than just waiting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1864.946">He</a>  says, yeah, he says you only got another 10 days in the license. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1869.947">It's</a>  not going to be renewed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1871.327">You</a>  know, the only thing that could, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1874.905">mess</a>  that up is if they try and renew the license, the porch. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1881.629">And</a>  at that point, they probably wouldn't have all the required documents because of the circumstances. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1893.536">So,</a>  I mean, it's <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1897.485">He</a>  says, and he said the other thing, too, is there was one other thing, and I forgot what it was. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1901.986">I</a>  wrote it down, but I made so many notes.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1910.668">You're</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1911.228">I</a>  think letting it expire makes the most sense. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1914.549">I</a>  don't like the one-day license because we don't allow any entity more than 30 one-day licenses. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1925.211">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1927.25">No,</a>  we'd only give them one day. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1929.911">Right,</a>  but wouldn't he want a one day for the remainder of the year for each day to stay open? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1935.072">Just</a>  one day?</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1936.532">One</a>  day for this party. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1938.452">It</a>  must be an important party.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1940.013">It's</a>  done. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1941.053">But</a>  remember, it's done, Bobby. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1943.613">It</a>  was like the 16th or something like that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1945.794">Oh,</a>  it's already over? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1947.014">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1947.894">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1947.974">I</a>  don't know what they did, but I don't know that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1951.115">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1952.975">So,</a>  yeah, it's passed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1954.836">The</a>  quickest way to get it through is just to let the license lapse. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1960.679">And</a>  at that point, the ABCC can move forward on it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1966.461">And</a>  that's really about, you know, the easiest and the best way to do it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1971.004">It's</a>  only going to tie them up a month. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1972.964">That's</a>  not the deal. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1976.826">And</a>  other than that, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1979.809">What</a>  else was there? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1980.629">I</a>  think that was. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1986.711">Yeah,</a>  I think that was it.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1989.492">Could</a>  Bobby, can I ask you a Daria? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1992.293">I.</a>  I, I'm going crazy trying to find. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=1998.02">the</a>  email link with the control compliance checks that had the liquor store in question for Tuesday's special hearing, can that be sent to me so I can read the police reports with that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2012.623">I</a>  just can't find that one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2014.823">Because</a>  I know that was in Fraction 1. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2017.184">That</a>  was the minor one.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2020.485">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2022.945">Which</a>  one are you asking for? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2024.105">The</a>  one that we just got last week?</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2027.733">No,</a>  wasn't there one before where we put them on? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2031.155">Oh,</a>  from... Was that June? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2034.917">Yeah,</a>  was that June that there was a police report on that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2040.64">Yeah,</a>  that's when they were doing the compliance checks. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2043.121">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2044.342">Yeah,</a>  I got that.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2046.711">I'll</a>  send it to you, Alan, because I'm looking at it.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2048.812">So</a>  I just want the one, because I wanted to read that one, because it's the same owner, same manager. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2056.556">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2057.256">And</a>  that same manager did get TIP certified. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2060.578">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2061.998">Those</a>  are some questions I had, because Daria sent me the copies of the TIP certification I asked for. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2068.882">So</a>  I wanted to make sure it was. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2070.302">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2072.629">I</a>  just wanted to refresh my memory with all of that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2075.17">I</a>  remember how we handled it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2077.251">But</a>  again, I wanted to read the police report on that particular package store.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2084.935">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2088.056">It</a>  wasn't too impressive. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2090.277">No.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2090.837">The</a>  first time around in June. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2092.278">No.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2096.779">what</a>  kind of ticks me off, and I'm sure it ticks you off. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2100.88">And</a>  I mean, the city itself, it shouldn't be having to deal with this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2106.981">The</a>  city doesn't want this type of behavior. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2112.603">This</a>  place is known to the miners in the city that this is where you go to buy your booze. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2119.544">It's</a>  got to stop. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2121.385">It</a>  has to stop. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2122.625">That's</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2124.405">So</a>  that's why we want to be prepared. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2127.826">That,</a>  you know, we're going to have to be prepared if he comes with a lawyer and be prepared and, you know, what the lawyer may ask for and, you know, we got to be able to. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2142.635">uh,</a>  be able to stand strong on certain things. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2146.176">So,</a>  um, you know, like I said, I, I gotta, I get a lot of good information today. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2152.537">Um,</a>  I didn't know if I was going to make the meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2155.418">Yeah,</a>  I've been on the phone so long. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2157.458">He</a>  just got back from Aruba and it was kind of like, okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2160.859">And,</a>  you know, and I, I just called him like a half hour before the meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2164.74">So</a>  it was, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2166.52">He</a>  gave me a lot of information. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2168.622">I</a>  try to cram down on a couple of pieces of paper, but yeah, so that's where we are with it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2176.168">What</a>  I can do is, you know, I'll probably, when's a good time for me to touch base with you, Dara? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2184.234">Are</a>  you going to be there today, tonight?</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2186.756">Yeah,</a>  so.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2188.338">Or</a>  tomorrow, better?</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2190.439">No,</a>  no, today's fine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2194.172">I'm</a>  just trying to think this through. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2195.653">So</a>  for the violations, we have to do a letter, right, that should go to him too? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2204.218">Just</a>  the agenda. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2206.059">Just</a>  an agenda. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2206.699">We</a>  have to break down the violations.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2208.76">I</a>  was going to reach out to Lieutenant Lockowitz and see if he actually sent them anything with the violation.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2217.105">Lieutenant</a>  Lockowitz?</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2219.37">What's</a>  that?</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2220.192">You</a>  said Lieutenant Lockovitz?</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2221.775">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2222.477">No,</a>  because I remember you said it just had to be mailed.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2226.306">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2227.257">No,</a>  but I mean his police reports that he sent them to the, uh, you know what I mean?</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2233.259">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2234.48">And</a>  what we have to do is the, I guess, I don't know what to call it, a summons that we're sending him. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2241.162">Um,</a>  we did that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2241.842">We</a>  just corrected. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2243.623">Um,</a>  we're going to have to redo that stating, um, the four violations and, um, four separate hearings on that day and the times of each hearing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2257.84">and</a>  we'll do the hearing and then go to the next hearing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2261.702">We</a>  can do the hearing, discuss it, make a decision on it, set the penalty, and then go to the next hearing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2276.411">That's</a>  the way Ralph suggested to do it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2278.412">He</a>  says either that or <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2281.503">He</a>  says, even, you know, you're going to correct it anyways, he says, because, you know, you know, you got it that they're coming in, you can only kind of really do one at a time if you don't specify that you're doing all, you know, all four hearings, they're separate hearings, one for each violation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2301.252">So,</a>  and he, I believe with that one too, he said, you might want to, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2309.412">just</a>  run that by KP law to make sure that the wording is okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2315.638">Ask</a>  if he sent that license a copy of the charges and hand deliver the new notice of the hearings, hand deliver the new notice <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2335.887">of</a>  the four scheduled hearings all the same day. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2340.09">So</a>  we've got to have Rory handle it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2343.413">Along</a>  with the police report? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2344.534">We've</a>  got to ask Rory. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2350.379">I</a>  believe he said they've got to be notified on what the charges are. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2357.745">I</a>  thought he said. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2359.486">So</a>  why he's appearing before the commission. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2363.947">So</a>  it could be you're appearing before this commission because of violation number one, November 1st, such and such, so many hours for violation of Mass General Law 138, section 34. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2378.694">Violation</a>  number two is going to be at 1215 for violation number one, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2389.499">violation</a>  of Chapter 138, Section 34. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2396.106">1230</a>  is going to be a hearing on violation of Chapter 138, Section 34. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2400.611">I</a>  don't know if that's good enough. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2408.917">I</a>  think Rory can kind of give us, I'm going to reach out to Rory anyways just to see what he thinks, the way to handle it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2417.62">Maybe</a>  if he's a little sketchy on it, he might be able to run it by KP law just to make sure the language is good or whatever.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2427.944">Are</a>  they aware that there's two a pair before us on the 26th? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2432.165">Do</a>  they know that?</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2433.406">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2434.246">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2434.906">Good.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2435.466">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2438.562">Yeah,</a>  I mean, that's kind of where we are with it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2442.908">Are</a>  those other people coming to the meeting? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2446.712">Are</a>  they going to be hybrid? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2451.959">That's</a>  why I didn't want to issue the thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2455.64">Yeah,</a>  okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2457.882">Yeah,</a>  we can knock them out of the way.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2460.224">Yeah,</a>  that's okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2461.866">I'm</a>  putting them first anyways, and then getting them done.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2464.488">And</a>  then why don't we schedule the, uh, the meetings 15 minutes apart starting at 1215. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2471.214">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2471.814">And</a>  we can take care of business the 1st, 15 minutes, get them out of them, get them out of there.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2476.518">And</a>  then we can conduct the well, because remember, one of them is a. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2482.75">Transfer</a>  so that one might be longer than 15 minutes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2486.593">Okay,</a>  if you include. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2490.656">License</a>  transfer license, and then the 3, 1 day licenses. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2495.42">Okay,</a>  the 1 day license is a quick, but I don't know how long to transfer. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2500.664">You</a>  know, I mean, we can do like, 1220.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2502.966">Yeah,</a>  1220 minutes is pretty much the paperwork all in order for the transfer.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2511.702">Yeah,</a>  yeah, it's all set. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2513.644">I'm</a>  going to send it to you guys today so you guys have it for... Okay.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2519.228">And</a>  if I see anything or you see anything in it, Alan, that might need correcting, we'll just shoot Daria a quick email. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2526.073">She</a>  can reach out to them, get it corrected before the actual meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2531.818">So</a>  once the meeting comes, we'll have everything in order. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2535.341">We</a>  can just kind of <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2537.785">Push</a>  it through if it's all good, you know.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2541.847">And</a>  of course, add Ben to the email string also.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2546.108">Yeah,</a>  I always add, I try to add you guys all together, unless I know you're not going to be there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2553.151">So</a>  for the establishment, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2556.825">Bobby,</a>  I forwarded you the email from the attorney. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2559.347">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2561.268">I</a>  don't know if you saw that or not. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2563.55">I</a>  don't think I did. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2564.831">Attorney</a>  Began, you might have not because he emailed me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2570.034">Did</a>  you just do that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2573.437">No,</a>  I sent it 1154.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2578.49">Yeah,</a>  I don't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2580.172">I</a>  might not have read that 1 already.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2581.573">Yeah,</a>  but he's basically asking if there's an any update on our end.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2588.099">Oh,</a>  yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2590.281">That's</a>  the 1 you're going to send it run it by KP. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2595.02">Yeah,</a>  do you want me to run it by KPLR if there's anything else we can do or just... I kind of mentioned that to Ralph and he says, what do you want to do that for? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2603.363">He</a>  says, he's going to charge you for what I just told you for free. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2606.884">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2610.725">Well,</a>  I just want to make sure that like, I just want to make sure we're good because obviously.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2615.868">No,</a>  Ralph Ralph put a pretty clear that as long as their license has not been surrendered for that property. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2626.108">whether</a>  he has a lease or not.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2629.51">There's</a>  nothing we can do.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2631.111">No.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2631.551">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2632.091">So</a>  until the license expires, they're knowing it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2636.894">And</a>  at that point, January 1st, they're good to go. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2641.957">I'm</a>  sure we can, what was his name? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2648.22">The</a>  ABCC inspector. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2651.582">We</a>  can send him. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2654.643">What</a>  was it?</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2655.623">Sean</a>  Walsh?</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2657.184">Yeah,</a>  you can send Sean probably just an email for us to December.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2662.805">He</a>  said, so I asked him, I did ask him about that and he said that we actually have to vote on it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2668.847">So</a>  in December when we vote on it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2671.595">is</a>  when I will notify that they didn't sign or whatever. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2676.058">It</a>  has to be voted on by the commission. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2677.739">They</a>  asked him the same thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2679.76">He</a>  said, no, you got to wait till you vote. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2683.603">But</a>  he said they'll push it along anyways.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2686.164">We're</a>  going to vote on the same thing that we did, just the application all over again?</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2692.768">Yeah,</a>  and all the renewals. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2694.589">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2695.83">on</a>  all the renewals because it's part of the renewal so if they don't sign it's not the application it's just the renewal for the porch if they're not signing then we'll have to vote on them not signing on it or renewing whatever not renewing okay we do that in december yes we do yeah because right now i don't have any of the right they're still coming in so that'll be december um our next meeting okay</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2722.207">Yeah,</a>  so I don't I don't mean to be kicking the horse, but. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2729.007">So</a>  is the establishment, are they in there, in the premises at all? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2736.028">Is</a>  the license on the wall and just nobody has taken it off? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2741.49">Or</a>  has the whole place been stripped out?</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2743.55">I</a>  have no idea, honestly. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2745.17">I</a>  don't know.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2747.511">From</a>  what I understood or assumed was that they're walking into a turnkey restaurant. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2753.772">Everything's</a>  there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2755.413">They're</a>  just going in and starting to do business.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2757.942">Yeah,</a>  that's what I thought, too, that it's just they able to go in there because there's nobody else in there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2763.366">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2763.887">But</a>  I don't know.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2764.867">Like</a>  the license, they'll be up on the wall or.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2768.771">Yeah,</a>  but I don't think we can just go in and take it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2771.132">It's</a>  got to be surrendered by. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2772.473">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2773.314">And</a>  by the license holder, is that is that the catch? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2776.256">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2777.037">Yeah,</a>  that's what I mean. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2779.419">I</a>  drive down to the porch there and yank it off the wall and confiscate it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2784.543">But</a>  we're out of the way. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2786.725">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2787.965">Ralph</a>  said, he says, you can't get in touch with the guy. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2791.466">I</a>  said, no, Daria's tried. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2793.847">She's</a>  got his phone number. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2795.147">She</a>  sent him emails. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2796.467">I</a>  says, the even second person in charge, she reached out to them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2800.808">She</a>  had a number, but she just couldn't get nobody's responding. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2805.129">There's</a>  nothing you can do. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2806.45">He</a>  says, somebody of authority and that license has to surrender it, or just send you a letter stating that they're surrendering the license. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2816.312">As</a>  long as it's in writing, he says, that's all you need. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2819.213">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2819.673">It's</a>  something on record. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2820.753">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2821.353">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2821.893">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2823.533">Unless,</a>  uh, unless we can get that, which it doesn't look like we're going to get, um, we got to go 30 days till the next meeting and vote on it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2831.355">Like</a>  Daria said that, uh, you know, they did not renew their license and there's a license available now and yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2839.476">Move</a>  forward. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2840.717">Um,</a>  okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2843.778">Yeah,</a>  and I don't know, Deshawn said that, did he have, did the establishment have to come before us again, or no?</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2849.982">No,</a>  no, no, no, no, no, no, he just said that.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2853.844">So</a>  just we get a vote.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2854.905">We'll</a>  just do the revision or whatever on top of the LLA local licensing authority certification form. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2862.409">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2862.889">They</a>  just receive it and push it through.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2865.931">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2866.371">So</a>  he said the only thing, I think the only issue is the fact that there's, <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2871.958">an</a>  active license, basically. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2874.46">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2876.661">Until</a>  the end of the month, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2879.283">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2879.743">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2880.003">They</a>  don't expire until December 31st. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2881.464">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2882.565">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2883.065">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2883.526">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2884.706">So</a>  how are we going to know that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2886.467">Oh,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2886.948">Because</a>  they didn't do it by November 30th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2889.589">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2890.25">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2890.55">They</a>  don't do it by November 30th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2892.791">That's</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2895.613">Then</a>  we know.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2896.734">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2897.855">That</a>  works. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2899.371">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2901.132">Anything</a>  else? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2904.275">Do</a>  we end the meeting?</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2905.736">I</a>  think that might be it on my end. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2908.578">I</a>  know, Bobby, when you maybe at some point, maybe five-ish or something, if you have availability, call me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2917.264">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2919.165">Just</a>  let me know whenever.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2920.883">Yeah,</a>  and I'll reach out to Rory in the meantime to see what, you know, get his input on it.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2926.468">Yeah,</a>  because I want to make sure that I get this letter done today then.</p>

    <p>[Robert Delafano]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2932.372">Yeah,</a>  I'll get on with him shortly after I get off this call and we'll see if we can get that squared away. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2941.84">And</a>  yeah, I think that's the best way to go.</p>

    <p>[Daria Tejera]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2947.445">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2949.206">Sounds</a>  good.</p>

    <p>[Allan Martorana]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2950.682">That's</a>  all I have. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2951.722">Alan,</a>  anyone else? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2952.703">Daria,</a>  no? <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2953.263">No,</a>  I'm good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2954.183">I'll</a>  motion to adjourn. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2956.864">It's</a>  1.52 p.m. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2958.624">I</a>  second that motion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/liquor-license-commission-11-20-24&start=2959.785">All</a>  those in favor?</p>
