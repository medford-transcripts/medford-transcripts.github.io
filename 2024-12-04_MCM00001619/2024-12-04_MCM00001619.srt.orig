1
00:00:00,691 --> 00:00:08,616
[SPEAKER_05]: The public meeting of the City of Medford Liquor License Commission for 11-20-24 will come to order.

2
00:00:10,037 --> 00:00:11,698
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have an agenda to follow.

3
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:25,667
[SPEAKER_05]: There are no minutes from last month, so we're going to move right on to the first item on the agenda, which is event, and I see Brian here.

4
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:30,154
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Brian, tell us a little bit about what's going on.

5
00:00:30,735 --> 00:00:31,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

6
00:00:31,695 --> 00:00:35,898
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I have two applications, and one is a collaboration.

7
00:00:36,598 --> 00:00:42,422
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this the collaboration with Cuisine and Locale, or is this the... Yes.

8
00:00:42,722 --> 00:00:42,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

9
00:00:43,303 --> 00:00:49,186
[SPEAKER_05]: So... We can do yours first, the event, then one, and then Cuisine and Locale after, second.

10
00:00:49,667 --> 00:00:49,907
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

11
00:00:50,087 --> 00:00:50,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

12
00:00:51,228 --> 00:00:54,670
[SPEAKER_02]: So, let's see, Friday, December 6th, if I'm correct.

13
00:00:55,417 --> 00:00:56,658
[SPEAKER_02]: beer and board games.

14
00:00:56,698 --> 00:00:58,399
[SPEAKER_02]: We basically, we do games here.

15
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:11,209
[SPEAKER_02]: We've done this before and basically we invite the community, local businesses, people to come to a free event and they can play games and the bar would be open for beer and wine.

16
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:16,993
[SPEAKER_02]: We did it, I think around, maybe around this time last year and it was really good.

17
00:01:17,013 --> 00:01:22,837
[SPEAKER_02]: We set up a bunch of tables and yeah, it was just something for people to do and come out for.

18
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:23,838
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're actually doing,

19
00:01:24,878 --> 00:01:30,444
[SPEAKER_02]: 3 gaming events that weekend, um, the, uh, the Saturday and Sunday, we will not be serving alcohol.

20
00:01:30,944 --> 00:01:33,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but we thought the Friday 1 would be good.

21
00:01:33,267 --> 00:01:36,910
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, the, the Friday and the Saturday and Sunday are video game.

22
00:01:37,111 --> 00:01:39,333
[SPEAKER_02]: And so those don't really, um.

23
00:01:40,754 --> 00:01:45,119
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not really an interest in it, so the Friday we would be interested in it for the beer and board games.

24
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:46,340
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

25
00:01:47,528 --> 00:01:48,128
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds good.

26
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:50,509
[SPEAKER_05]: You always do a good job.

27
00:01:51,089 --> 00:01:54,231
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure we've got the insurance on file.

28
00:01:55,111 --> 00:01:57,392
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have just like an annual insurance for this?

29
00:01:57,812 --> 00:02:04,295
[SPEAKER_02]: We do, but I usually pull a one day additional liquor liability on it.

30
00:02:04,535 --> 00:02:06,916
[SPEAKER_02]: So once we get the application, I usually just send it over.

31
00:02:06,936 --> 00:02:11,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, if you can send that over to Daria, that'd be great.

32
00:02:13,362 --> 00:02:16,785
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, and we know where you always serve your alcohol.

33
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:19,127
[SPEAKER_05]: It's always the same, so same layout.

34
00:02:21,129 --> 00:02:22,950
[SPEAKER_05]: Allen, do you have any questions for Brian?

35
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:23,251
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

36
00:02:23,871 --> 00:02:24,752
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Mr. Chairman.

37
00:02:24,792 --> 00:02:26,173
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say the same thing.

38
00:02:27,474 --> 00:02:35,141
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember this event last year, and Brian has the insurance on record in the diagram, so we're good.

39
00:02:35,201 --> 00:02:36,942
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm comfortable with this.

40
00:02:37,123 --> 00:02:39,805
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have any questions for Brian.

41
00:02:39,825 --> 00:02:40,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

42
00:02:41,645 --> 00:02:48,267
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm here for most, pretty much 90% of any event that we do that has alcohol, so.

43
00:02:48,427 --> 00:02:51,108
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll take it any chance.

44
00:02:51,749 --> 00:02:54,089
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's in good hands at that point.

45
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, you want to make a motion?

46
00:02:57,811 --> 00:02:58,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'll make a motion.

47
00:02:59,711 --> 00:03:08,114
[SPEAKER_04]: I motion to approve the one-day license for Event Dam to be held on December 6th from 7 to 10 p.m.

48
00:03:11,605 --> 00:03:13,987
[SPEAKER_05]: All righty, and I'll second that motion.

49
00:03:14,507 --> 00:03:15,327
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

50
00:03:15,868 --> 00:03:15,988
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

51
00:03:16,588 --> 00:03:16,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

52
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:18,009
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

53
00:03:18,429 --> 00:03:20,390
[SPEAKER_05]: Hearing and seeing none, the ayes have it.

54
00:03:20,651 --> 00:03:22,012
[SPEAKER_05]: You're all set with that one, Brian.

55
00:03:22,512 --> 00:03:23,152
[SPEAKER_05]: Great, thank you.

56
00:03:23,673 --> 00:03:24,193
[SPEAKER_05]: You're welcome.

57
00:03:24,693 --> 00:03:24,893
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

58
00:03:25,374 --> 00:03:26,474
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go to the next.

59
00:03:27,535 --> 00:03:31,738
[SPEAKER_05]: That's for... Jean.

60
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:33,258
[SPEAKER_05]: JJ Gonson.

61
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:36,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

62
00:03:37,201 --> 00:03:37,561
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.

63
00:03:37,641 --> 00:03:39,442
[SPEAKER_02]: We do collaborations with JJ.

64
00:03:39,642 --> 00:03:39,723
[SPEAKER_02]: She,

65
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:45,872
[SPEAKER_02]: She owns, she has, what am I trying to say?

66
00:03:45,912 --> 00:03:48,094
[SPEAKER_02]: A catering business, also does production.

67
00:03:48,134 --> 00:03:51,295
[SPEAKER_02]: She used to own one, so she still does, which is in Somerville.

68
00:03:53,016 --> 00:03:57,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, she knows some great artists, and we've done collaborations with her in the past.

69
00:03:57,758 --> 00:04:01,340
[SPEAKER_02]: This is actually the same artist we had, I think it was back in May.

70
00:04:02,921 --> 00:04:08,124
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically, she's a singer-songwriter, piano player, almost like,

71
00:04:09,456 --> 00:04:14,661
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to say like dueling piano style, but I don't know what to call it because there's no other piano player.

72
00:04:15,302 --> 00:04:21,547
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, yeah, just a real heartwarming, uh, event, like tells like, it's like a storytelling thing.

73
00:04:21,567 --> 00:04:22,128
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really great.

74
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:24,650
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of my favorites that we've ever done here.

75
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:31,337
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he'll be returning, um, in December for a more holiday themed event.

76
00:04:32,378 --> 00:04:34,720
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and yeah, that was actually one of our.

77
00:04:37,063 --> 00:04:41,924
[SPEAKER_02]: the best sales night for, for, for beer and wine that we've had here.

78
00:04:43,925 --> 00:04:51,126
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, again, we're not like, no, because we were over serving anybody or anything, but just this, you know, it's just, it's just applied to the crowd.

79
00:04:51,206 --> 00:04:52,907
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was, uh, it was great.

80
00:04:53,367 --> 00:04:57,068
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like you have a good size crowd to 30 to 50, which is, yeah.

81
00:04:57,228 --> 00:04:57,508
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

82
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:59,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, you never know at that time of year.

83
00:04:59,468 --> 00:05:01,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I'd rather play it safe.

84
00:05:01,889 --> 00:05:02,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

85
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:05,690
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but you know, I mean, people have conflicts that time of year.

86
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:06,850
[SPEAKER_02]: So absolutely.

87
00:05:08,531 --> 00:05:13,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Brian, I think I heard you say this, but will you be attending this event on December 14th?

88
00:05:13,655 --> 00:05:14,396
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be here as well.

89
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:15,376
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll be there also.

90
00:05:15,536 --> 00:05:15,797
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

91
00:05:16,377 --> 00:05:21,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, because I typically, again, try to be here for any event that we have alcohol for.

92
00:05:21,281 --> 00:05:21,461
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

93
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:22,202
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

94
00:05:22,262 --> 00:05:23,783
[SPEAKER_02]: But honestly, I want to be at this one.

95
00:05:23,803 --> 00:05:25,244
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like it's a great event.

96
00:05:25,264 --> 00:05:26,165
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so.

97
00:05:26,405 --> 00:05:26,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

98
00:05:27,797 --> 00:05:36,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and I see the Mr chairman, I see the insurance that I can see a million dollars and then a 2 million dollar aggregate.

99
00:05:36,362 --> 00:05:38,684
[SPEAKER_04]: So the insurance is in place and it's current.

100
00:05:39,484 --> 00:05:44,768
[SPEAKER_04]: So, and we know the layout, so I don't have any other questions other than good luck.

101
00:05:45,248 --> 00:05:47,029
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, very good.

102
00:05:47,489 --> 00:05:47,830
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good.

103
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:47,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

104
00:05:48,985 --> 00:05:49,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Al.

105
00:05:50,365 --> 00:06:02,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I motion to approve the one-day license for the event to be held on December 14th for cuisine and locale for J.J.

106
00:06:02,068 --> 00:06:04,029
[SPEAKER_04]: Gonson and event them.

107
00:06:05,609 --> 00:06:06,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, very good.

108
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,410
[SPEAKER_05]: I second that motion.

109
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:08,350
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

110
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:08,870
[SPEAKER_00]: Aye.

111
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:09,771
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

112
00:06:09,931 --> 00:06:10,711
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

113
00:06:11,351 --> 00:06:12,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely none.

114
00:06:12,431 --> 00:06:13,131
[SPEAKER_05]: The ayes have it.

115
00:06:14,272 --> 00:06:14,972
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

116
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:16,642
[SPEAKER_05]: Good to go, Brian.

117
00:06:17,062 --> 00:06:17,542
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good.

118
00:06:17,782 --> 00:06:18,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Brian, good to see you.

119
00:06:18,883 --> 00:06:19,563
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy holidays.

120
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,343
[SPEAKER_02]: You too.

121
00:06:20,383 --> 00:06:21,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody have a safe holiday.

122
00:06:22,064 --> 00:06:23,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye now.

123
00:06:23,744 --> 00:06:24,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy events.

00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:26,725
[SPEAKER_02]: You too.

127
00:06:29,245 --> 00:06:29,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

128
00:06:31,546 --> 00:06:38,948
[SPEAKER_05]: Next on the agenda, do we have a representative from NN Liquor Co-op, DBA Main Street Liquor?

129
00:06:42,405 --> 00:06:44,287
[SPEAKER_05]: That's you, the one raising your hand.

130
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:49,751
[SPEAKER_05]: You gotta take your thing off of mute.

131
00:06:50,071 --> 00:06:55,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, off of mute and the camera, I see more sailing than you.

132
00:06:59,739 --> 00:07:00,580
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I got it.

133
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:01,501
[SPEAKER_05]: You got it.

134
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:02,922
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

135
00:07:02,942 --> 00:07:03,823
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, yeah.

136
00:07:04,663 --> 00:07:05,204
[SPEAKER_05]: How you doing?

137
00:07:05,244 --> 00:07:09,988
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you be able to just state your name and the address of your business for the record, please?

138
00:07:10,554 --> 00:07:12,275
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, my name is Kusum Latha.

139
00:07:12,656 --> 00:07:15,798
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 395 Main Street, Laker.

140
00:07:16,398 --> 00:07:16,758
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

141
00:07:18,239 --> 00:07:20,621
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we just want to change the hours there.

142
00:07:21,461 --> 00:07:21,782
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

143
00:07:22,522 --> 00:07:28,146
[SPEAKER_01]: It was 8 to 11, and we want to do like 10 to 10, like 10 AM to 10 PM.

144
00:07:28,726 --> 00:07:28,986
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

145
00:07:30,007 --> 00:07:35,091
[SPEAKER_05]: And that would be for, OK, and that's for seven days a week?

146
00:07:36,131 --> 00:07:37,152
[SPEAKER_01]: Seven days a week, yeah.

147
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:40,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, same hours.

148
00:07:41,293 --> 00:07:41,933
[SPEAKER_01]: Same hour.

149
00:07:42,434 --> 00:07:42,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

150
00:07:43,635 --> 00:07:44,316
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um.

151
00:07:44,817 --> 00:07:48,801
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me just take a look at the paperwork that was submitted.

152
00:07:48,821 --> 00:07:51,584
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you sent that over.

153
00:07:53,919 --> 00:08:00,586
[SPEAKER_05]: I see that you have the corporate vote, which is completed and fine.

154
00:08:01,326 --> 00:08:08,813
[SPEAKER_05]: You have a letter stating to this commission that you're looking to change the hours for exactly what you said.

155
00:08:11,276 --> 00:08:13,278
[SPEAKER_05]: The only thing that you're missing here is

156
00:08:17,785 --> 00:08:18,326
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

157
00:08:20,969 --> 00:08:23,391
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a no fee transmittal form.

158
00:08:25,774 --> 00:08:32,301
[SPEAKER_05]: Gary, I can, I don't know if you've got one handy, but I can send one over to you.

159
00:08:34,504 --> 00:08:37,607
[SPEAKER_05]: If not, can you be able to send it over to her?

160
00:08:38,397 --> 00:08:39,777
[SPEAKER_06]: I can send it over to her, yeah.

161
00:08:40,278 --> 00:08:41,418
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you've got one?

162
00:08:42,619 --> 00:08:43,779
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking on the website now.

163
00:08:44,359 --> 00:08:46,020
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I'll send one over to you.

164
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,880
[SPEAKER_05]: I have it on my desktop.

165
00:08:48,381 --> 00:08:51,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I can probably do it right now if we want to wait a second.

166
00:08:51,642 --> 00:08:51,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

167
00:08:53,122 --> 00:08:54,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

168
00:09:00,825 --> 00:09:01,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

169
00:09:02,786 --> 00:09:05,687
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that has to be filled out and

170
00:09:08,245 --> 00:09:08,926
[SPEAKER_05]: No fee.

171
00:09:09,306 --> 00:09:10,467
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no fee for it.

172
00:09:10,687 --> 00:09:13,589
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just got to go over to the ABCC with the paperwork.

173
00:09:13,609 --> 00:09:17,372
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me clear that.

174
00:09:17,872 --> 00:09:19,013
[SPEAKER_05]: Add the attachment.

175
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:32,604
[SPEAKER_04]: So Chairman, were you thinking of tabling that or moving forward with that subject to the completion of that form?

176
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:36,017
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think we can move forward with it.

177
00:09:37,358 --> 00:09:38,659
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it's a big deal.

178
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:39,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

179
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,502
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, because it's we've got the letter.

180
00:09:43,602 --> 00:09:45,523
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all pretty much set up.

181
00:09:46,063 --> 00:09:53,628
[SPEAKER_05]: If she could just get it over to Daria as soon as possible, you know, and I'd say Daria.

182
00:09:55,103 --> 00:09:59,247
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, Mr chairman and Derek, can you let us know when the completed form arrives?

183
00:09:59,287 --> 00:09:59,787
[SPEAKER_04]: So we know.

184
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:04,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, consumer fulfilled that that request.

185
00:10:05,192 --> 00:10:13,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, because I'm just going to make a. A conditional approval on that or.

186
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:16,902
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it'll be subject to the completion of that form.

187
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:28,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Bobby, you're on mute.

188
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,749
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, I just saw it over there.

189
00:10:29,849 --> 00:10:31,430
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, yeah, that'll be good.

190
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:36,734
[SPEAKER_05]: That way they can get on with their new hours and stuff and we won't be holding them up.

191
00:10:36,934 --> 00:10:45,861
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you can, get it over to Daria as soon as possible, hopefully by the end of the week, and you'll be all good to go, okay?

192
00:10:46,502 --> 00:10:46,882
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

193
00:10:47,728 --> 00:10:49,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Alan, you want to make a motion?

194
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:50,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Please.

195
00:10:50,989 --> 00:11:04,072
[SPEAKER_04]: I motion to accept and approve the application for change of hours for Main Street Liquor Mart subject to the completion of the no fee transmittal form.

196
00:11:05,232 --> 00:11:16,935
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm hoping that'll be done immediately within 24, 48 hours so you can get that off your desk and Daria can take care of the package and we can get moving with ABCCs.

197
00:11:17,915 --> 00:11:18,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Information.

198
00:11:20,878 --> 00:11:21,939
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, that'd be great.

199
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:24,021
[SPEAKER_05]: I will 2nd that motion.

200
00:11:24,121 --> 00:11:25,102
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor.

201
00:11:25,402 --> 00:11:25,723
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.

202
00:11:26,744 --> 00:11:29,586
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed hearing and seeing none.

203
00:11:29,626 --> 00:11:30,347
[SPEAKER_05]: The eyes have it.

204
00:11:30,887 --> 00:11:31,768
[SPEAKER_05]: You are all set.

205
00:11:32,129 --> 00:11:34,251
[SPEAKER_05]: Just get that over the area as soon as you can.

206
00:11:34,311 --> 00:11:34,611
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

207
00:11:35,251 --> 00:11:35,672
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

208
00:11:36,352 --> 00:11:37,053
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

209
00:11:37,093 --> 00:11:37,774
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice holidays.

210
00:11:37,794 --> 00:11:38,855
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

211
00:11:38,895 --> 00:11:39,175
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.

212
00:11:39,215 --> 00:11:39,696
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.

213
00:11:40,236 --> 00:11:40,416
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye.

214
00:11:40,476 --> 00:11:40,757
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye.

215
00:11:41,177 --> 00:11:41,297
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye.

216
00:11:41,317 --> 00:11:41,457
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.

217
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:47,353
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, let's see.

218
00:11:48,394 --> 00:11:57,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Next on the agenda, we have, do we have a representative from 116 Riverside Catering, which is, what's that, the Hyatt?

219
00:11:57,962 --> 00:11:59,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we did it last month.

220
00:11:59,824 --> 00:12:03,127
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why I have to, that's all.

221
00:12:03,207 --> 00:12:05,469
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of saw that on there and I'm saying,

222
00:12:06,587 --> 00:12:10,589
[SPEAKER_05]: But I, yeah, I'm like, did they fire him already, or did he quit already?

223
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:11,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

224
00:12:12,369 --> 00:12:12,730
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

225
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:14,811
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I wasn't here last month.

226
00:12:14,851 --> 00:12:15,971
[SPEAKER_05]: No wonder why I don't remember it.

227
00:12:17,292 --> 00:12:18,112
[SPEAKER_05]: I was away, right?

228
00:12:18,532 --> 00:12:18,812
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

229
00:12:19,052 --> 00:12:20,293
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you were, you were, yeah.

230
00:12:20,393 --> 00:12:22,974
[SPEAKER_05]: You were away, yeah.

231
00:12:23,674 --> 00:12:24,895
[SPEAKER_05]: That's, okay.

232
00:12:26,736 --> 00:12:27,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh boy.

233
00:12:28,376 --> 00:12:28,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry about that.

234
00:12:29,477 --> 00:12:29,977
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you're fine.

235
00:12:31,438 --> 00:12:32,098
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

236
00:12:32,778 --> 00:12:34,519
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna just X that one out.

237
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:39,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, do we the same thing go for the ocean state job?

238
00:12:39,911 --> 00:12:43,952
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think I don't see anybody on here, but I did email them.

239
00:12:45,012 --> 00:12:45,332
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

240
00:12:45,632 --> 00:12:47,252
[SPEAKER_06]: And they said that somebody was going to come.

241
00:12:47,292 --> 00:12:48,152
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know.

242
00:12:49,053 --> 00:12:50,773
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, well, maybe after.

243
00:12:52,013 --> 00:12:53,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, maybe they'll catch up at the end.

244
00:12:54,514 --> 00:12:54,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

245
00:12:55,594 --> 00:13:00,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we can after we after we talk to Peter, if they're on, we can we can take them on.

246
00:13:01,744 --> 00:13:06,148
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, Peter, I know you're the representative for Desisto Enterprises.

247
00:13:07,069 --> 00:13:14,276
[SPEAKER_05]: You're doing a change of category application for your location on 313 Mystic Ave, Medford.

248
00:13:14,796 --> 00:13:14,996
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

249
00:13:15,256 --> 00:13:26,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want to just kind of give us a little description about what's going on, where you're going to be serving the liquor, where the bar's going to be set up, is it all going to basically be the same, you know?

250
00:13:26,834 --> 00:13:28,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's pretty much all going to stay the same.

251
00:13:28,836 --> 00:13:31,439
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just adding a little bit of liquor to the function room bar.

252
00:13:31,459 --> 00:13:39,949
[SPEAKER_03]: In the future or not, if I'm going to do anything in the restaurant, the actual restaurant, I might do a small menu and just run out of the function room possibly.

253
00:13:39,969 --> 00:13:43,914
[SPEAKER_03]: Mostly for the function room because we get a lot of

254
00:13:47,758 --> 00:13:50,320
[SPEAKER_03]: The clients that come in, they'd want something more than beer and wine.

255
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:53,823
[SPEAKER_03]: So, it's like we find that it's kind of, yeah, it's a little bit of a struggle sometimes.

256
00:13:53,883 --> 00:13:58,367
[SPEAKER_03]: I even have people like back out because they're realizing that the full lick is not in play.

257
00:13:58,407 --> 00:14:03,212
[SPEAKER_03]: So, they just try to... So, it's kind of costing us a little bit right now.

258
00:14:03,252 --> 00:14:07,335
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, again, like a small menu, just something to offer and, you know.

259
00:14:08,862 --> 00:14:14,004
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I've been to a couple of functions there, and it's a good size room.

260
00:14:14,024 --> 00:14:15,785
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know what the seating capacity is in it?

261
00:14:16,245 --> 00:14:17,206
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we hold 100.

262
00:14:17,766 --> 00:14:18,066
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

263
00:14:18,326 --> 00:14:22,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Licensed for 100 at the time, but we never really get a crowd that big, to be honest with you.

264
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:24,169
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so you're over the 60.

265
00:14:24,529 --> 00:14:27,490
[SPEAKER_05]: 70, 75 is probably the biggest that come, yeah.

266
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:28,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, cool.

267
00:14:29,211 --> 00:14:34,013
[SPEAKER_05]: And now, is there going to be...

268
00:14:36,901 --> 00:14:40,302
[SPEAKER_05]: liquor available in the other part of the restaurant as well.

269
00:14:40,362 --> 00:14:41,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have that now?

270
00:14:41,782 --> 00:14:42,682
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I was just saying.

271
00:14:42,722 --> 00:14:47,223
[SPEAKER_03]: If we do a small menu, I'll just run it out of the service bar in the function room.

272
00:14:47,523 --> 00:14:47,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

273
00:14:47,723 --> 00:14:47,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

274
00:14:48,263 --> 00:14:48,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

275
00:14:48,803 --> 00:14:49,663
[SPEAKER_03]: If that's okay.

276
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:50,403
[SPEAKER_03]: If that's okay.

277
00:14:51,164 --> 00:15:04,446
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if somebody wants a beer, for instance, like say I come in and I get a, I don't know, a pizza or a sub or something, and I have a cold beer with it, is it the norm for you to take the beer from the function room into the- A lot of times.

278
00:15:04,766 --> 00:15:10,249
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of times we do, but we do have a small stock in the restaurant as well.

279
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:24,979
[SPEAKER_05]: The only thing I was trying to get at is that the pizza, let's call it pizza restaurant section of your restaurant, is on the original plans of where alcohol could be stored and served, correct?

280
00:15:25,579 --> 00:15:25,799
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

281
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:26,180
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

282
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,400
[SPEAKER_05]: You originally opened.

283
00:15:27,601 --> 00:15:27,921
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

284
00:15:28,021 --> 00:15:39,229
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I wanted to find out, uh, just to make sure that you weren't bringing the alcohol into a place that wasn't already, um, set up for us bringing alcohol in.

285
00:15:39,469 --> 00:15:43,231
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're doing that already, it's, I'm sure it's on the original plan.

286
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:47,214
[SPEAKER_05]: So Alan, I was on, uh, then I, I'm not sure whether you remember.

287
00:15:47,434 --> 00:15:47,775
[SPEAKER_04]: I do.

288
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:48,335
[SPEAKER_04]: I do.

289
00:15:48,395 --> 00:15:49,316
[SPEAKER_04]: It is on the original.

290
00:15:49,336 --> 00:15:50,677
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Guy was on back then.

291
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:51,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

292
00:15:54,078 --> 00:16:00,540
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember all of that.

293
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's fine.

294
00:16:03,681 --> 00:16:04,281
[SPEAKER_04]: He can do it.

295
00:16:04,501 --> 00:16:04,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

296
00:16:05,302 --> 00:16:05,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, good.

297
00:16:06,302 --> 00:16:06,502
[SPEAKER_05]: Good.

298
00:16:07,442 --> 00:16:08,703
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw everything.

299
00:16:09,163 --> 00:16:10,343
[SPEAKER_05]: I looked at all the papers.

300
00:16:10,423 --> 00:16:12,404
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything seems to be in order.

301
00:16:12,724 --> 00:16:15,185
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you do this yourself or does the lawyer do it?

302
00:16:16,855 --> 00:16:17,176
[SPEAKER_05]: I did it.

303
00:16:18,316 --> 00:16:18,677
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

304
00:16:18,697 --> 00:16:19,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

305
00:16:19,597 --> 00:16:24,421
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to go into business here because you hit the nail on the head with everything.

306
00:16:24,941 --> 00:16:29,244
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me tell you, compared to the City of Somerville, you guys are like...

307
00:16:31,304 --> 00:16:34,926
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, you go on the ABCC website, it's very easy to follow.

308
00:16:35,326 --> 00:16:36,967
[SPEAKER_05]: All you do is just point and click.

309
00:16:37,207 --> 00:16:38,448
[SPEAKER_06]: It really is not.

310
00:16:38,568 --> 00:16:39,768
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not difficult to navigate.

311
00:16:40,189 --> 00:16:41,589
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's wonderful.

312
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:46,352
[SPEAKER_05]: And it'd be wonderful if everybody was thorough.

313
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:48,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's organized and efficient.

314
00:16:48,793 --> 00:16:49,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

315
00:16:49,894 --> 00:16:53,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, so I just want to congratulate you on that.

316
00:16:53,995 --> 00:16:55,196
[SPEAKER_05]: Alan, do you have anything?

317
00:16:55,996 --> 00:16:57,056
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no.

318
00:16:57,156 --> 00:16:58,937
[SPEAKER_04]: I went through the package.

319
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:03,378
[SPEAKER_04]: I see the certificate of good standing, the tax compliance.

320
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:05,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no, this is great.

321
00:17:05,479 --> 00:17:06,079
[SPEAKER_04]: This is great.

322
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,420
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.

323
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:07,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

324
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:13,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no, I went through it a number of times, and everything seems to be fine.

325
00:17:13,262 --> 00:17:15,002
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm good with it.

326
00:17:17,748 --> 00:17:29,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me make a motion to accept and move forward, approve and move forward with the change of category application for Desisto Enterprises.

327
00:17:30,577 --> 00:17:32,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, and I'll second that motion.

328
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:33,359
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

329
00:17:33,379 --> 00:17:34,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

330
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,841
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

331
00:17:36,361 --> 00:17:38,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Hearing and seeing none, the ayes have it.

332
00:17:39,227 --> 00:17:40,367
[SPEAKER_05]: Congratulations, Peter.

333
00:17:40,627 --> 00:17:41,328
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys are awesome.

334
00:17:41,348 --> 00:17:42,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much, everybody.

335
00:17:42,608 --> 00:17:43,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a happy Thanksgiving to all of you.

336
00:17:44,008 --> 00:17:44,288
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

337
00:17:44,308 --> 00:17:47,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Peter, I know Rotary will be happy when we have our scholarship night.

338
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:49,890
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

339
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:53,511
[SPEAKER_05]: And take this young lady out for doing a good job.

340
00:17:53,551 --> 00:17:54,051
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

341
00:17:54,211 --> 00:17:54,792
[SPEAKER_05]: I like you.

342
00:17:55,432 --> 00:17:56,872
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe Avelinos.

343
00:17:56,932 --> 00:17:57,932
[SPEAKER_05]: No, not Avelinos.

344
00:17:57,972 --> 00:17:59,393
[SPEAKER_05]: Go someplace a little fancier.

345
00:17:59,513 --> 00:18:00,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.

346
00:18:00,733 --> 00:18:02,654
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

347
00:18:02,714 --> 00:18:04,254
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy holidays.

348
00:18:04,514 --> 00:18:05,235
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy holidays.

349
00:18:05,275 --> 00:18:05,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks again.

350
00:18:06,295 --> 00:18:06,635
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye-bye.

351
00:18:09,013 --> 00:18:10,375
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, let's see.

352
00:18:10,835 --> 00:18:13,539
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that clears us up, correct?

353
00:18:13,619 --> 00:18:14,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

354
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:14,440
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

355
00:18:15,181 --> 00:18:16,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

356
00:18:18,085 --> 00:18:24,553
[SPEAKER_05]: With 116 Riverside, I just found a couple of things, but I mean, if it's already been pushed through and stuff.

357
00:18:24,573 --> 00:18:25,474
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well, we approved it.

358
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:33,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I mean, it's if it comes back from the ABCC, we'll get in touch with him and I saw that the vote of the entity board was missing.

359
00:18:33,917 --> 00:18:38,098
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yeah, that that was supposed to be part of it.

360
00:18:38,859 --> 00:18:41,860
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, Harold, you're willing to send the whole page.

361
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:42,740
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

362
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,460
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it wasn't even on it.

363
00:18:45,661 --> 00:18:48,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I see 116 Riverside.

364
00:18:51,553 --> 00:18:56,222
[SPEAKER_05]: You had the change of manager amendment, which is the transmittal form.

365
00:18:57,704 --> 00:19:00,670
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you had the amendment change of manager.

366
00:19:03,032 --> 00:19:07,635
[SPEAKER_05]: which gave the business information, Harold Jones, blah, blah, blah.

367
00:19:08,175 --> 00:19:09,836
[SPEAKER_05]: And he said, resume attached.

368
00:19:10,476 --> 00:19:12,077
[SPEAKER_05]: But he was- And there's nothing attached.

369
00:19:12,778 --> 00:19:18,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, he was supposed to sign it, not Susan, whatever her name is, I can't read it.

370
00:19:18,881 --> 00:19:21,123
[SPEAKER_05]: But she signed it instead of him.

371
00:19:21,143 --> 00:19:24,905
[SPEAKER_06]: You talking about this function's middle stage or no?

372
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:27,086
[SPEAKER_05]: No, first page.

373
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:28,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Nevermind.

374
00:19:29,492 --> 00:19:32,513
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's the payment for it, the one you just showed me.

375
00:19:32,913 --> 00:19:38,234
[SPEAKER_05]: But the first page is the- This one?

376
00:19:38,334 --> 00:19:41,114
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the monetary transmittal, yep.

377
00:19:41,655 --> 00:19:42,455
[SPEAKER_05]: It's that one there.

378
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:45,215
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's on here.

379
00:19:45,695 --> 00:19:47,036
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder if it's scanned in.

380
00:19:47,596 --> 00:19:48,396
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they got that.

381
00:19:48,536 --> 00:19:52,797
[SPEAKER_05]: Then the next page was the change of manager.

382
00:19:54,310 --> 00:20:03,054
[SPEAKER_05]: The amendment and it said the address and the person that's in charge of the licenses and permits is Sean Nault.

383
00:20:04,715 --> 00:20:11,158
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the proposed manager name is Harold Jones and gives his information, email, all that good stuff.

384
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:14,500
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it says resume attached.

385
00:20:15,161 --> 00:20:25,090
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it says at the bottom of that page, I hereby swear under the pains and penalties of perjury that the information I have provided in this application is true and correct.

386
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:30,134
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's signed, it says manager's signature, which is supposed to be him, not Susan.

387
00:20:30,214 --> 00:20:31,575
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, I see that.

388
00:20:34,318 --> 00:20:38,363
[SPEAKER_05]: Then she did the applicant statement, Susan Schultz, she signed it.

389
00:20:38,383 --> 00:20:39,364
[SPEAKER_05]: She signed again, yep.

390
00:20:39,764 --> 00:20:41,987
[SPEAKER_05]: You do all of that stuff, that was correct.

391
00:20:42,668 --> 00:20:44,770
[SPEAKER_05]: But then she, then the query was fine.

392
00:20:45,431 --> 00:20:50,196
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, I don't know where they got this page, it says number 12, manager application.

393
00:20:50,236 --> 00:20:53,059
[SPEAKER_05]: It's basically got the same information on it.

394
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:58,883
[SPEAKER_05]: that the one that he didn't sign has, only this one he signed.

395
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:05,727
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they took it out of a new application or something.

396
00:21:07,829 --> 00:21:09,530
[SPEAKER_05]: That would make sense now that you say that.

397
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:11,831
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of like cut and paste it, I think.

398
00:21:11,851 --> 00:21:12,011
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

399
00:21:13,292 --> 00:21:15,957
[SPEAKER_05]: So I, you know, I just, it's not a big deal.

400
00:21:15,977 --> 00:21:20,324
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just letting you know in case the ABCC kicks it back.

401
00:21:20,444 --> 00:21:21,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they will kick it back to them.

402
00:21:21,926 --> 00:21:23,869
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, we'll have them corrected.

403
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:24,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

404
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:27,094
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it was fine.

405
00:21:29,256 --> 00:21:36,102
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder if they realized they made a mistake, and that's why they did that page again and had Mr. Jones sign it.

406
00:21:36,883 --> 00:21:37,303
[SPEAKER_04]: He could have.

407
00:21:37,884 --> 00:21:38,264
[SPEAKER_04]: He could have.

408
00:21:38,284 --> 00:21:38,544
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder.

409
00:21:39,004 --> 00:21:39,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

410
00:21:39,605 --> 00:21:45,270
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just going to suggest that if they were here today, because I didn't know what went on last month.

411
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:54,057
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't here, but if they were scheduled to be here today, I was just going to tell them to just correct the papers and send the whole packet out to Daria.

412
00:21:54,798 --> 00:22:04,560
[SPEAKER_05]: instead of just the one page, because I know it's a pain for Daria to try and rescan everything and take stuff out of a PDF that's got five, six pages.

413
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,600
[SPEAKER_05]: It's craziness.

414
00:22:05,981 --> 00:22:12,422
[SPEAKER_05]: So when we have people correct stuff, I'm going to start telling them, send the whole package corrected.

415
00:22:12,442 --> 00:22:18,323
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you usually get them on a PDF, Daria, with all the things on one page?

416
00:22:18,463 --> 00:22:20,304
[SPEAKER_05]: Or do they just mail them to you?

417
00:22:21,463 --> 00:22:23,527
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes it really depends.

418
00:22:23,828 --> 00:22:29,178
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people are very top-notch, get everything together for me.

419
00:22:29,198 --> 00:22:29,278
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

420
00:22:30,778 --> 00:22:31,998
[SPEAKER_06]: once everything is ready.

421
00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:38,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Some give me pieces by pieces and that's where it becomes a pain in the butt because then I don't, I just don't have time to.

422
00:22:38,919 --> 00:22:39,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

423
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,660
[SPEAKER_04]: So they don't drop, they don't come to City Hall and drop off?

424
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,420
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes they do.

425
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:43,780
[SPEAKER_04]: It depends.

426
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,981
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of them do.

427
00:22:45,121 --> 00:22:48,641
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of them just scan it in and send the whole PDF?

428
00:22:48,941 --> 00:22:54,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, most of them do send me the original and I'll ask, I will tell them, can you send me the original please?

429
00:22:54,922 --> 00:22:58,043
[SPEAKER_06]: But they will also send me the emailed version.

430
00:22:58,623 --> 00:22:58,843
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

431
00:23:00,216 --> 00:23:00,977
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that'll be good.

432
00:23:01,037 --> 00:23:07,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Just so you don't have to go crazy if you got to do any corrections and if they got to do any corrections and stuff.

433
00:23:08,267 --> 00:23:11,251
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, so I was going to email Ocean State job lot.

434
00:23:13,085 --> 00:23:19,370
[SPEAKER_06]: And I said, hello, no one appear in front of the Liquor License Commission for a change in manager application today.

435
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:20,691
[SPEAKER_06]: The application will be tabled.

436
00:23:21,412 --> 00:23:27,156
[SPEAKER_06]: Should I tell them the next meeting, special meeting, or should we just have them come for December?

437
00:23:27,817 --> 00:23:28,717
[SPEAKER_06]: Come for December.

438
00:23:28,818 --> 00:23:29,338
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fine.

439
00:23:29,618 --> 00:23:30,799
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to change a manager.

440
00:23:30,879 --> 00:23:33,261
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's not a big deal.

441
00:23:33,962 --> 00:23:36,564
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I confirmed twice.

442
00:23:36,924 --> 00:23:39,746
[SPEAKER_06]: I emailed, I followed up because nobody responded to me.

443
00:23:41,257 --> 00:23:51,145
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to make sure that they received it and then they applied and said that Ralph Kimber, which I think is the proposed manager, will be in attendance.

444
00:23:51,685 --> 00:23:51,905
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

445
00:23:52,626 --> 00:23:55,528
[SPEAKER_06]: But that was November 6th.

446
00:23:56,829 --> 00:23:59,111
[SPEAKER_04]: We can push that to December.

447
00:23:59,151 --> 00:24:01,292
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's fine.

448
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:05,455
[SPEAKER_05]: I think our special meeting is going to be long.

449
00:24:08,524 --> 00:24:16,818
[SPEAKER_05]: And I spoke with Ralph today because I had a couple of questions.

450
00:24:18,858 --> 00:24:29,648
[SPEAKER_05]: He said, they notify, he says, you folks notified them that there are four different incidents, four different violations.

451
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:34,933
[SPEAKER_05]: I says, I'm not sure how we notified them, to be honest with you.

452
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,714
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we notified them to appear.

453
00:24:36,734 --> 00:24:43,901
[SPEAKER_05]: And he says, yeah, he says, you gotta notify them that they have to appear for four separate violations.

454
00:24:45,618 --> 00:24:49,400
[SPEAKER_05]: He says, each one of them, you're going to read individually.

455
00:24:51,501 --> 00:25:05,930
[SPEAKER_05]: When you read them individually, at that point, if you want to set what they're going to have to have for a violation punishment, you got to do it for each one.

456
00:25:07,228 --> 00:25:17,172
[SPEAKER_05]: And he kind of explained to me basically the way that it works and how we progress every violation, the next violation.

457
00:25:18,552 --> 00:25:21,193
[SPEAKER_05]: He explained to me how it should progress.

458
00:25:22,934 --> 00:25:28,896
[SPEAKER_05]: He also said before we send out the notification that we're going to be

459
00:25:31,042 --> 00:25:36,125
[SPEAKER_05]: hearing all four violations at the same day, we've got to put times in.

460
00:25:36,425 --> 00:25:39,387
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's noon, first violation, 12 o'clock.

461
00:25:39,807 --> 00:25:40,707
[SPEAKER_05]: Second violation, 12.15.

462
00:25:40,787 --> 00:25:41,568
[SPEAKER_05]: Third violation, 12.45.

463
00:25:42,188 --> 00:25:43,429
[SPEAKER_05]: Fourth violation, 1 o'clock.

464
00:25:47,823 --> 00:25:52,684
[SPEAKER_05]: And it got to be hand-delivered by Rory to make sure he gets it.

465
00:25:53,765 --> 00:26:01,847
[SPEAKER_05]: He said, also, you want to run it by KP law to make sure we get the right language in there in case it needs to be polished up a little.

466
00:26:01,867 --> 00:26:09,589
[SPEAKER_05]: I told him about the signage for the window.

467
00:26:14,822 --> 00:26:25,671
[SPEAKER_05]: And he said just, he says, that's beautiful, that's good, you wanna do that, he said, but run that by KP Law too in case it needs to be polished a little bit.

468
00:26:26,692 --> 00:26:29,474
[SPEAKER_05]: And what was, just remind me, what was the signage?

469
00:26:30,375 --> 00:26:38,561
[SPEAKER_05]: The signage in the window is just basically telling them that, telling the public.

470
00:26:39,022 --> 00:26:40,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Consumer, yeah.

471
00:26:40,643 --> 00:26:42,424
[SPEAKER_05]: It's gotta be displayed eye level,

472
00:26:43,458 --> 00:26:46,579
[SPEAKER_05]: on the inside of the glass so people can read it from outside.

473
00:26:46,599 --> 00:26:54,443
[SPEAKER_05]: I can basically read it without the name.

474
00:26:56,684 --> 00:27:02,907
[SPEAKER_05]: Name of the business is prohibited from selling any products containing alcohol per order of the Method License Commission.

475
00:27:04,233 --> 00:27:21,084
[SPEAKER_05]: from such-and-such-a-date to such-and-such-a-date due to liquor license suspension for violation of Mass General Law, Chapter 138, Section 34, sale, delivery, or furnishing of alcoholic beverages to persons under 21 years of age.

476
00:27:21,945 --> 00:27:28,289
[SPEAKER_05]: And then in small letters down the bottom, I put, the store may resume normal hours of operation on December 1st.

477
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:32,012
[SPEAKER_05]: I shouldn't, such-and-such-a-date.

478
00:27:34,749 --> 00:27:56,906
[SPEAKER_05]: He also advised me on how we should, you know, we can have the hearings and after each violation hearing, we can set the, not the fine, the punishment for it.

479
00:27:57,726 --> 00:27:57,866
[SPEAKER_05]: And

480
00:28:01,485 --> 00:28:05,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Once that's done, we get into the next one and then we set.

481
00:28:06,213 --> 00:28:07,734
[SPEAKER_05]: the punishment for that one.

482
00:28:08,034 --> 00:28:09,315
[SPEAKER_05]: And we get another one.

483
00:28:09,736 --> 00:28:12,257
[SPEAKER_05]: And that way, it progresses.

484
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:16,480
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's, as you can see in our things, it goes in steps.

485
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:21,504
[SPEAKER_05]: First violation, you know, warning, second violation, one day suspension.

486
00:28:21,524 --> 00:28:22,645
[SPEAKER_05]: And these are all major.

487
00:28:23,045 --> 00:28:25,647
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not, they're all major.

488
00:28:26,267 --> 00:28:30,751
[SPEAKER_04]: So it sounds like what you're saying is that we have to treat each infraction individually.

489
00:28:30,771 --> 00:28:31,991
[SPEAKER_04]: That is correct.

490
00:28:32,712 --> 00:28:32,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

491
00:28:33,412 --> 00:28:33,813
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we,

492
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:52,026
[SPEAKER_04]: We know what occurred, and we hear their side of the argument, and then we ask questions, and then we come to some resolution with that one, and then we go to the next one.

493
00:28:52,086 --> 00:28:54,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we give each one

494
00:28:56,693 --> 00:29:02,060
[SPEAKER_04]: 20 minutes, 30 minutes, because you had mentioned there has to be a timeframe on the agenda.

495
00:29:02,541 --> 00:29:04,583
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, that's what Ralph said.

496
00:29:05,024 --> 00:29:08,968
[SPEAKER_05]: He was saying, yeah, the first one could be 12, then 1230, then Monday.

497
00:29:09,068 --> 00:29:12,032
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't think we need a half hour for each one.

498
00:29:12,072 --> 00:29:12,533
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no.

499
00:29:13,093 --> 00:29:14,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Some might be quick.

500
00:29:14,535 --> 00:29:15,576
[SPEAKER_05]: Some might be longer.

501
00:29:15,596 --> 00:29:15,757
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

502
00:29:16,397 --> 00:29:18,720
[SPEAKER_05]: You can do them 10 minutes apart if you want.

503
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,382
[SPEAKER_05]: If it goes a little longer, it goes a little longer.

504
00:29:21,402 --> 00:29:23,605
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a big deal.

505
00:29:23,625 --> 00:29:24,946
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just kind of like a

506
00:29:30,695 --> 00:29:34,419
[SPEAKER_05]: a couple of little tweaks that he wanted, which were good.

507
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:43,408
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm glad I gave him a call because the reason why I called him was because of the incident with the porch that we're having.

508
00:29:43,428 --> 00:29:49,675
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you are aware of it, Alan, but the new owners that are going to be going into the porch,

509
00:29:52,348 --> 00:29:55,470
[SPEAKER_05]: can't get in because the porch never surrendered their license.

510
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:57,531
[SPEAKER_05]: The license, I'd heard that, yes.

511
00:29:58,011 --> 00:30:01,994
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's options.

512
00:30:03,815 --> 00:30:05,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Ralph gave me two, three different options.

513
00:30:07,017 --> 00:30:09,198
[SPEAKER_05]: Can't they wait for the end of the year till it expires?

514
00:30:09,218 --> 00:30:11,640
[SPEAKER_05]: That is the best option for them.

515
00:30:13,181 --> 00:30:21,906
[SPEAKER_05]: Only he says, if it's extreme and they really want to get in there any, well, not any earlier,

516
00:30:22,853 --> 00:30:25,354
[SPEAKER_05]: but they can withdraw their application.

517
00:30:26,794 --> 00:30:39,938
[SPEAKER_05]: So now they're not applying for a Section 12 license, so they can get a one-day license to have in there, and because they already have the lease secured.

518
00:30:40,918 --> 00:30:43,739
[SPEAKER_05]: But he says the bad thing about that is, is if

519
00:30:46,062 --> 00:30:52,904
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, he says they're going to have to re-advertise to all the abutters when they reapply.

520
00:30:53,464 --> 00:30:57,845
[SPEAKER_05]: They won't have to pay the $200 fee again, but they're going to have to re-advertise.

521
00:30:57,865 --> 00:30:59,545
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to have to put it in the paper.

522
00:31:00,765 --> 00:31:04,826
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm saying, that's going to take them longer than just waiting.

523
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:08,527
[SPEAKER_05]: He says, yeah, he says you only got another 10 days in the license.

524
00:31:09,947 --> 00:31:10,967
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not going to be renewed.

525
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:13,328
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the only thing that could,

526
00:31:14,905 --> 00:31:20,188
[SPEAKER_05]: mess that up is if they try and renew the license, the porch.

527
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:31,635
[SPEAKER_05]: And at that point, they probably wouldn't have all the required documents because of the circumstances.

528
00:31:33,536 --> 00:31:34,837
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, it's

529
00:31:37,485 --> 00:31:41,966
[SPEAKER_05]: He says, and he said the other thing, too, is there was one other thing, and I forgot what it was.

530
00:31:41,986 --> 00:31:48,487
[SPEAKER_05]: I wrote it down, but I made so many notes.

531
00:31:50,668 --> 00:31:51,168
[SPEAKER_04]: You're right.

532
00:31:51,228 --> 00:31:53,628
[SPEAKER_04]: I think letting it expire makes the most sense.

533
00:31:54,549 --> 00:32:04,231
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like the one-day license because we don't allow any entity more than 30 one-day licenses.

534
00:32:05,211 --> 00:32:05,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

535
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:08,570
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we'd only give them one day.

536
00:32:09,911 --> 00:32:14,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, but wouldn't he want a one day for the remainder of the year for each day to stay open?

537
00:32:15,072 --> 00:32:15,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Just one day?

538
00:32:16,532 --> 00:32:17,932
[SPEAKER_05]: One day for this party.

539
00:32:18,452 --> 00:32:19,993
[SPEAKER_05]: It must be an important party.

540
00:32:20,013 --> 00:32:20,613
[SPEAKER_06]: It's done.

541
00:32:21,053 --> 00:32:22,533
[SPEAKER_06]: But remember, it's done, Bobby.

542
00:32:23,613 --> 00:32:25,474
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like the 16th or something like that.

543
00:32:25,794 --> 00:32:26,574
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's already over?

544
00:32:27,014 --> 00:32:27,314
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

545
00:32:27,894 --> 00:32:27,954
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

546
00:32:27,974 --> 00:32:30,835
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what they did, but I don't know that.

547
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:31,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

548
00:32:32,975 --> 00:32:34,716
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, it's passed.

549
00:32:34,836 --> 00:32:40,078
[SPEAKER_05]: The quickest way to get it through is just to let the license lapse.

550
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:44,380
[SPEAKER_05]: And at that point, the ABCC can move forward on it.

551
00:32:46,461 --> 00:32:50,663
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's really about, you know, the easiest and the best way to do it.

552
00:32:51,004 --> 00:32:52,644
[SPEAKER_05]: It's only going to tie them up a month.

553
00:32:52,964 --> 00:32:55,526
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not the deal.

554
00:32:56,826 --> 00:32:57,647
[SPEAKER_05]: And other than that,

555
00:32:59,809 --> 00:33:00,609
[SPEAKER_05]: What else was there?

556
00:33:00,629 --> 00:33:02,970
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that was.

557
00:33:06,711 --> 00:33:07,811
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think that was it.

558
00:33:09,492 --> 00:33:12,152
[SPEAKER_04]: Could Bobby, can I ask you a Daria?

559
00:33:12,293 --> 00:33:15,834
[SPEAKER_04]: I. I, I'm going crazy trying to find.

560
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:32,463
[SPEAKER_04]: the email link with the control compliance checks that had the liquor store in question for Tuesday's special hearing, can that be sent to me so I can read the police reports with that?

561
00:33:32,623 --> 00:33:34,003
[SPEAKER_04]: I just can't find that one.

562
00:33:34,823 --> 00:33:36,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I know that was in Fraction 1.

563
00:33:37,184 --> 00:33:38,244
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the minor one.

564
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:42,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

565
00:33:42,945 --> 00:33:44,065
[SPEAKER_06]: Which one are you asking for?

566
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:46,986
[SPEAKER_06]: The one that we just got last week?

567
00:33:47,733 --> 00:33:51,135
[SPEAKER_04]: No, wasn't there one before where we put them on?

568
00:33:51,155 --> 00:33:54,417
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, from... Was that June?

569
00:33:54,917 --> 00:33:59,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, was that June that there was a police report on that?

570
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's when they were doing the compliance checks.

571
00:34:03,121 --> 00:34:03,581
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

572
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:05,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I got that.

573
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,532
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll send it to you, Alan, because I'm looking at it.

574
00:34:08,812 --> 00:34:16,196
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just want the one, because I wanted to read that one, because it's the same owner, same manager.

575
00:34:16,556 --> 00:34:16,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

576
00:34:17,256 --> 00:34:20,098
[SPEAKER_05]: And that same manager did get TIP certified.

577
00:34:20,578 --> 00:34:20,878
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

578
00:34:21,998 --> 00:34:27,801
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are some questions I had, because Daria sent me the copies of the TIP certification I asked for.

579
00:34:28,882 --> 00:34:30,202
[SPEAKER_05]: So I wanted to make sure it was.

580
00:34:30,302 --> 00:34:30,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

581
00:34:32,629 --> 00:34:35,150
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to refresh my memory with all of that.

582
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:36,751
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember how we handled it.

583
00:34:37,251 --> 00:34:43,374
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, I wanted to read the police report on that particular package store.

584
00:34:44,935 --> 00:34:45,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

585
00:34:48,056 --> 00:34:49,657
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't too impressive.

586
00:34:50,277 --> 00:34:50,497
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

587
00:34:50,837 --> 00:34:52,258
[SPEAKER_05]: The first time around in June.

588
00:34:52,278 --> 00:34:52,358
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

589
00:34:56,779 --> 00:35:00,680
[SPEAKER_05]: what kind of ticks me off, and I'm sure it ticks you off.

590
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:06,901
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, the city itself, it shouldn't be having to deal with this.

591
00:35:06,981 --> 00:35:10,302
[SPEAKER_05]: The city doesn't want this type of behavior.

592
00:35:12,603 --> 00:35:19,224
[SPEAKER_05]: This place is known to the miners in the city that this is where you go to buy your booze.

593
00:35:19,544 --> 00:35:20,985
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got to stop.

594
00:35:21,385 --> 00:35:22,145
[SPEAKER_05]: It has to stop.

595
00:35:22,625 --> 00:35:24,105
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

596
00:35:24,405 --> 00:35:26,506
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's why we want to be prepared.

597
00:35:27,826 --> 00:35:40,072
[SPEAKER_05]: That, you know, we're going to have to be prepared if he comes with a lawyer and be prepared and, you know, what the lawyer may ask for and, you know, we got to be able to.

598
00:35:42,635 --> 00:35:45,676
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, be able to stand strong on certain things.

599
00:35:46,176 --> 00:35:52,517
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, you know, like I said, I, I gotta, I get a lot of good information today.

600
00:35:52,537 --> 00:35:55,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I didn't know if I was going to make the meeting.

601
00:35:55,418 --> 00:35:56,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I've been on the phone so long.

602
00:35:57,458 --> 00:36:00,799
[SPEAKER_05]: He just got back from Aruba and it was kind of like, okay.

603
00:36:00,859 --> 00:36:04,680
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, and I, I just called him like a half hour before the meeting.

604
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:05,240
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was,

605
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,562
[SPEAKER_05]: He gave me a lot of information.

606
00:36:08,622 --> 00:36:15,227
[SPEAKER_05]: I try to cram down on a couple of pieces of paper, but yeah, so that's where we are with it.

607
00:36:16,168 --> 00:36:24,214
[SPEAKER_05]: What I can do is, you know, I'll probably, when's a good time for me to touch base with you, Dara?

608
00:36:24,234 --> 00:36:25,996
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you going to be there today, tonight?

609
00:36:26,756 --> 00:36:27,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so.

610
00:36:28,338 --> 00:36:29,579
[SPEAKER_05]: Or tomorrow, better?

611
00:36:30,439 --> 00:36:32,040
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, today's fine.

612
00:36:34,172 --> 00:36:35,473
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just trying to think this through.

613
00:36:35,653 --> 00:36:42,497
[SPEAKER_06]: So for the violations, we have to do a letter, right, that should go to him too?

614
00:36:44,218 --> 00:36:45,078
[SPEAKER_06]: Just the agenda.

615
00:36:46,059 --> 00:36:46,679
[SPEAKER_06]: Just an agenda.

616
00:36:46,699 --> 00:36:48,180
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to break down the violations.

617
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:57,085
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to reach out to Lieutenant Lockowitz and see if he actually sent them anything with the violation.

618
00:36:57,105 --> 00:36:57,605
[SPEAKER_06]: Lieutenant Lockowitz?

619
00:36:59,370 --> 00:36:59,751
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that?

620
00:37:00,192 --> 00:37:01,314
[SPEAKER_06]: You said Lieutenant Lockovitz?

621
00:37:01,775 --> 00:37:02,036
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

622
00:37:02,477 --> 00:37:04,903
[SPEAKER_06]: No, because I remember you said it just had to be mailed.

623
00:37:06,306 --> 00:37:06,386
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

624
00:37:07,257 --> 00:37:12,879
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but I mean his police reports that he sent them to the, uh, you know what I mean?

625
00:37:13,259 --> 00:37:13,899
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

626
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:20,882
[SPEAKER_05]: And what we have to do is the, I guess, I don't know what to call it, a summons that we're sending him.

627
00:37:21,162 --> 00:37:21,822
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, we did that.

628
00:37:21,842 --> 00:37:22,723
[SPEAKER_05]: We just corrected.

629
00:37:23,623 --> 00:37:36,868
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, we're going to have to redo that stating, um, the four violations and, um, four separate hearings on that day and the times of each hearing.

630
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:41,502
[SPEAKER_05]: and we'll do the hearing and then go to the next hearing.

631
00:37:41,702 --> 00:37:53,689
[SPEAKER_05]: We can do the hearing, discuss it, make a decision on it, set the penalty, and then go to the next hearing.

632
00:37:56,411 --> 00:37:58,172
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the way Ralph suggested to do it.

633
00:37:58,412 --> 00:37:59,973
[SPEAKER_05]: He says either that or

634
00:38:01,503 --> 00:38:20,111
[SPEAKER_05]: He says, even, you know, you're going to correct it anyways, he says, because, you know, you know, you got it that they're coming in, you can only kind of really do one at a time if you don't specify that you're doing all, you know, all four hearings, they're separate hearings, one for each violation.

635
00:38:21,252 --> 00:38:27,875
[SPEAKER_05]: So, and he, I believe with that one too, he said, you might want to,

636
00:38:29,412 --> 00:38:34,357
[SPEAKER_05]: just run that by KP law to make sure that the wording is okay.

637
00:38:35,638 --> 00:38:54,275
[SPEAKER_05]: Ask if he sent that license a copy of the charges and hand deliver the new notice of the hearings, hand deliver the new notice

638
00:38:55,887 --> 00:38:59,030
[SPEAKER_05]: of the four scheduled hearings all the same day.

639
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:02,392
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've got to have Rory handle it.

640
00:39:03,413 --> 00:39:04,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Along with the police report?

641
00:39:04,534 --> 00:39:09,378
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got to ask Rory.

642
00:39:10,379 --> 00:39:17,124
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe he said they've got to be notified on what the charges are.

643
00:39:17,745 --> 00:39:18,665
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought he said.

644
00:39:19,486 --> 00:39:22,168
[SPEAKER_05]: So why he's appearing before the commission.

645
00:39:23,947 --> 00:39:38,654
[SPEAKER_05]: So it could be you're appearing before this commission because of violation number one, November 1st, such and such, so many hours for violation of Mass General Law 138, section 34.

646
00:39:38,694 --> 00:39:42,016
[SPEAKER_05]: Violation number two is going to be at 1215 for violation number one,

647
00:39:49,499 --> 00:39:53,383
[SPEAKER_05]: violation of Chapter 138, Section 34.

648
00:39:56,106 --> 00:40:00,571
[SPEAKER_05]: 1230 is going to be a hearing on violation of Chapter 138, Section 34.

649
00:40:00,611 --> 00:40:02,893
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if that's good enough.

650
00:40:08,917 --> 00:40:17,380
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Rory can kind of give us, I'm going to reach out to Rory anyways just to see what he thinks, the way to handle it.

651
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:26,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe if he's a little sketchy on it, he might be able to run it by KP law just to make sure the language is good or whatever.

652
00:40:27,944 --> 00:40:31,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they aware that there's two a pair before us on the 26th?

653
00:40:32,165 --> 00:40:32,805
[SPEAKER_04]: Do they know that?

654
00:40:33,406 --> 00:40:33,626
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

655
00:40:34,246 --> 00:40:34,466
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

656
00:40:34,906 --> 00:40:35,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.

657
00:40:35,466 --> 00:40:35,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

658
00:40:38,562 --> 00:40:42,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, that's kind of where we are with it.

659
00:40:42,908 --> 00:40:46,652
[SPEAKER_05]: Are those other people coming to the meeting?

660
00:40:46,712 --> 00:40:48,094
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they going to be hybrid?

661
00:40:51,959 --> 00:40:54,002
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I didn't want to issue the thing.

662
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,442
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, okay.

663
00:40:57,882 --> 00:41:00,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we can knock them out of the way.

664
00:41:00,224 --> 00:41:01,625
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's okay.

665
00:41:01,866 --> 00:41:04,408
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm putting them first anyways, and then getting them done.

666
00:41:04,488 --> 00:41:10,793
[SPEAKER_05]: And then why don't we schedule the, uh, the meetings 15 minutes apart starting at 1215.

667
00:41:11,214 --> 00:41:11,474
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

668
00:41:11,814 --> 00:41:16,438
[SPEAKER_05]: And we can take care of business the 1st, 15 minutes, get them out of them, get them out of there.

669
00:41:16,518 --> 00:41:21,042
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we can conduct the well, because remember, one of them is a.

670
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:26,013
[SPEAKER_06]: Transfer so that one might be longer than 15 minutes.

671
00:41:26,593 --> 00:41:28,735
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, if you include.

672
00:41:30,656 --> 00:41:34,560
[SPEAKER_06]: License transfer license, and then the 3, 1 day licenses.

673
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:39,503
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, the 1 day license is a quick, but I don't know how long to transfer.

674
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:42,766
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I mean, we can do like, 1220.

675
00:41:42,966 --> 00:41:47,009
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, 1220 minutes is pretty much the paperwork all in order for the transfer.

676
00:41:51,702 --> 00:41:53,323
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, it's all set.

677
00:41:53,644 --> 00:41:56,166
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to send it to you guys today so you guys have it for... Okay.

678
00:41:59,228 --> 00:42:06,053
[SPEAKER_05]: And if I see anything or you see anything in it, Alan, that might need correcting, we'll just shoot Daria a quick email.

679
00:42:06,073 --> 00:42:11,698
[SPEAKER_05]: She can reach out to them, get it corrected before the actual meeting.

680
00:42:11,818 --> 00:42:15,081
[SPEAKER_05]: So once the meeting comes, we'll have everything in order.

681
00:42:15,341 --> 00:42:16,202
[SPEAKER_05]: We can just kind of

682
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:21,047
[SPEAKER_05]: Push it through if it's all good, you know.

683
00:42:21,847 --> 00:42:25,728
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, add Ben to the email string also.

684
00:42:26,108 --> 00:42:31,270
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I always add, I try to add you guys all together, unless I know you're not going to be there.

685
00:42:33,151 --> 00:42:35,052
[SPEAKER_06]: So for the establishment,

686
00:42:36,825 --> 00:42:39,327
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby, I forwarded you the email from the attorney.

687
00:42:39,347 --> 00:42:40,468
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

688
00:42:41,268 --> 00:42:43,109
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you saw that or not.

689
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:44,430
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think I did.

690
00:42:44,831 --> 00:42:48,813
[SPEAKER_06]: Attorney Began, you might have not because he emailed me.

691
00:42:50,034 --> 00:42:50,955
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you just do that?

692
00:42:53,437 --> 00:42:55,138
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I sent it 1154.

693
00:42:58,490 --> 00:43:00,072
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I don't know.

694
00:43:00,172 --> 00:43:01,553
[SPEAKER_05]: I might not have read that 1 already.

695
00:43:01,573 --> 00:43:06,858
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but he's basically asking if there's an any update on our end.

696
00:43:08,099 --> 00:43:10,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

697
00:43:10,281 --> 00:43:13,705
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the 1 you're going to send it run it by KP.

698
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:23,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, do you want me to run it by KPLR if there's anything else we can do or just... I kind of mentioned that to Ralph and he says, what do you want to do that for?

699
00:43:23,363 --> 00:43:26,824
[SPEAKER_05]: He says, he's going to charge you for what I just told you for free.

700
00:43:26,884 --> 00:43:27,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

701
00:43:30,725 --> 00:43:35,228
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I just want to make sure that like, I just want to make sure we're good because obviously.

702
00:43:35,868 --> 00:43:44,913
[SPEAKER_05]: No, Ralph Ralph put a pretty clear that as long as their license has not been surrendered for that property.

703
00:43:46,108 --> 00:43:47,769
[SPEAKER_05]: whether he has a lease or not.

704
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:50,490
[SPEAKER_06]: There's nothing we can do.

705
00:43:51,111 --> 00:43:51,291
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

706
00:43:51,551 --> 00:43:51,831
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

707
00:43:52,091 --> 00:43:56,154
[SPEAKER_05]: So until the license expires, they're knowing it.

708
00:43:56,894 --> 00:44:00,176
[SPEAKER_05]: And at that point, January 1st, they're good to go.

709
00:44:01,957 --> 00:44:06,780
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure we can, what was his name?

710
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:09,801
[SPEAKER_05]: The ABCC inspector.

711
00:44:11,582 --> 00:44:12,543
[SPEAKER_05]: We can send him.

712
00:44:14,643 --> 00:44:15,043
[SPEAKER_05]: What was it?

713
00:44:15,623 --> 00:44:16,744
[SPEAKER_06]: Sean Walsh?

714
00:44:17,184 --> 00:44:22,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you can send Sean probably just an email for us to December.

715
00:44:22,805 --> 00:44:28,807
[SPEAKER_06]: He said, so I asked him, I did ask him about that and he said that we actually have to vote on it.

716
00:44:28,847 --> 00:44:30,628
[SPEAKER_06]: So in December when we vote on it.

717
00:44:31,595 --> 00:44:35,738
[SPEAKER_06]: is when I will notify that they didn't sign or whatever.

718
00:44:36,058 --> 00:44:37,719
[SPEAKER_06]: It has to be voted on by the commission.

719
00:44:37,739 --> 00:44:39,740
[SPEAKER_06]: They asked him the same thing.

720
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,642
[SPEAKER_06]: He said, no, you got to wait till you vote.

721
00:44:43,603 --> 00:44:46,144
[SPEAKER_06]: But he said they'll push it along anyways.

722
00:44:46,164 --> 00:44:52,428
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to vote on the same thing that we did, just the application all over again?

723
00:44:52,768 --> 00:44:54,169
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and all the renewals.

724
00:44:54,589 --> 00:44:54,789
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

725
00:44:55,830 --> 00:45:21,447
[SPEAKER_06]: on all the renewals because it's part of the renewal so if they don't sign it's not the application it's just the renewal for the porch if they're not signing then we'll have to vote on them not signing on it or renewing whatever not renewing okay we do that in december yes we do yeah because right now i don't have any of the right they're still coming in so that'll be december um our next meeting okay

726
00:45:22,207 --> 00:45:28,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so I don't I don't mean to be kicking the horse, but.

727
00:45:29,007 --> 00:45:35,888
[SPEAKER_04]: So is the establishment, are they in there, in the premises at all?

728
00:45:36,028 --> 00:45:41,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Is the license on the wall and just nobody has taken it off?

729
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:43,030
[SPEAKER_04]: Or has the whole place been stripped out?

730
00:45:43,550 --> 00:45:45,150
[SPEAKER_06]: I have no idea, honestly.

731
00:45:45,170 --> 00:45:46,531
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

732
00:45:47,511 --> 00:45:53,192
[SPEAKER_05]: From what I understood or assumed was that they're walking into a turnkey restaurant.

733
00:45:53,772 --> 00:45:54,492
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything's there.

734
00:45:55,413 --> 00:45:57,393
[SPEAKER_05]: They're just going in and starting to do business.

735
00:45:57,942 --> 00:46:02,986
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's what I thought, too, that it's just they able to go in there because there's nobody else in there.

736
00:46:03,366 --> 00:46:03,626
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

737
00:46:03,887 --> 00:46:04,767
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't know.

738
00:46:04,867 --> 00:46:07,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the license, they'll be up on the wall or.

739
00:46:08,771 --> 00:46:11,072
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but I don't think we can just go in and take it.

740
00:46:11,132 --> 00:46:12,453
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got to be surrendered by.

741
00:46:12,473 --> 00:46:12,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

742
00:46:13,314 --> 00:46:16,116
[SPEAKER_04]: And by the license holder, is that is that the catch?

743
00:46:16,256 --> 00:46:16,597
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

744
00:46:17,037 --> 00:46:19,179
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's what I mean.

745
00:46:19,419 --> 00:46:24,463
[SPEAKER_04]: I drive down to the porch there and yank it off the wall and confiscate it.

746
00:46:24,543 --> 00:46:26,244
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're out of the way.

747
00:46:26,725 --> 00:46:26,845
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

748
00:46:27,965 --> 00:46:30,986
[SPEAKER_05]: Ralph said, he says, you can't get in touch with the guy.

749
00:46:31,466 --> 00:46:33,747
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, no, Daria's tried.

750
00:46:33,847 --> 00:46:35,067
[SPEAKER_05]: She's got his phone number.

751
00:46:35,147 --> 00:46:36,367
[SPEAKER_05]: She sent him emails.

752
00:46:36,467 --> 00:46:40,788
[SPEAKER_05]: I says, the even second person in charge, she reached out to them.

753
00:46:40,808 --> 00:46:44,049
[SPEAKER_05]: She had a number, but she just couldn't get nobody's responding.

754
00:46:45,129 --> 00:46:46,250
[SPEAKER_05]: There's nothing you can do.

755
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:55,492
[SPEAKER_05]: He says, somebody of authority and that license has to surrender it, or just send you a letter stating that they're surrendering the license.

756
00:46:56,312 --> 00:46:58,772
[SPEAKER_05]: As long as it's in writing, he says, that's all you need.

757
00:46:59,213 --> 00:46:59,413
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

758
00:46:59,673 --> 00:47:00,533
[SPEAKER_05]: It's something on record.

759
00:47:00,753 --> 00:47:00,973
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

760
00:47:01,353 --> 00:47:01,553
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

761
00:47:01,893 --> 00:47:02,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

762
00:47:03,533 --> 00:47:11,295
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless, uh, unless we can get that, which it doesn't look like we're going to get, um, we got to go 30 days till the next meeting and vote on it.

763
00:47:11,355 --> 00:47:19,076
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Daria said that, uh, you know, they did not renew their license and there's a license available now and yeah.

764
00:47:19,476 --> 00:47:20,177
[SPEAKER_05]: Move forward.

765
00:47:20,717 --> 00:47:21,037
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, okay.

766
00:47:23,778 --> 00:47:29,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and I don't know, Deshawn said that, did he have, did the establishment have to come before us again, or no?

767
00:47:29,982 --> 00:47:33,384
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, he just said that.

768
00:47:33,844 --> 00:47:34,885
[SPEAKER_05]: So just we get a vote.

769
00:47:34,905 --> 00:47:41,809
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll just do the revision or whatever on top of the LLA local licensing authority certification form.

770
00:47:42,409 --> 00:47:42,689
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

771
00:47:42,889 --> 00:47:45,231
[SPEAKER_06]: They just receive it and push it through.

772
00:47:45,931 --> 00:47:46,091
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

773
00:47:46,371 --> 00:47:50,474
[SPEAKER_06]: So he said the only thing, I think the only issue is the fact that there's,

774
00:47:51,958 --> 00:47:53,799
[SPEAKER_06]: an active license, basically.

775
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:55,901
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

776
00:47:56,661 --> 00:47:58,943
[SPEAKER_06]: Until the end of the month, right?

777
00:47:59,283 --> 00:47:59,543
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

778
00:47:59,743 --> 00:47:59,963
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

779
00:48:00,003 --> 00:48:01,444
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't expire until December 31st.

780
00:48:01,464 --> 00:48:02,045
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

781
00:48:02,565 --> 00:48:02,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

782
00:48:03,065 --> 00:48:03,265
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

783
00:48:03,526 --> 00:48:03,746
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

784
00:48:04,706 --> 00:48:06,447
[SPEAKER_05]: So how are we going to know that?

785
00:48:06,467 --> 00:48:06,908
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.

786
00:48:06,948 --> 00:48:09,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they didn't do it by November 30th.

787
00:48:09,589 --> 00:48:09,910
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

788
00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:10,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

789
00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:12,771
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't do it by November 30th.

790
00:48:12,791 --> 00:48:14,953
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

791
00:48:15,613 --> 00:48:16,073
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we know.

792
00:48:16,734 --> 00:48:16,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

793
00:48:17,855 --> 00:48:18,295
[SPEAKER_05]: That works.

794
00:48:19,371 --> 00:48:20,452
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

795
00:48:21,132 --> 00:48:22,753
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything else?

796
00:48:24,275 --> 00:48:25,195
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we end the meeting?

797
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:28,197
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that might be it on my end.

798
00:48:28,578 --> 00:48:36,663
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, Bobby, when you maybe at some point, maybe five-ish or something, if you have availability, call me.

799
00:48:37,264 --> 00:48:38,825
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

800
00:48:39,165 --> 00:48:40,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Just let me know whenever.

801
00:48:40,883 --> 00:48:46,047
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and I'll reach out to Rory in the meantime to see what, you know, get his input on it.

802
00:48:46,468 --> 00:48:50,191
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because I want to make sure that I get this letter done today then.

803
00:48:52,372 --> 00:49:01,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'll get on with him shortly after I get off this call and we'll see if we can get that squared away.

804
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:06,684
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, I think that's the best way to go.

805
00:49:07,445 --> 00:49:07,725
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

806
00:49:09,206 --> 00:49:09,446
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds good.

807
00:49:10,682 --> 00:49:11,502
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I have.

808
00:49:11,722 --> 00:49:12,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Alan, anyone else?

809
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:13,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Daria, no?

810
00:49:13,263 --> 00:49:14,083
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm good.

811
00:49:14,183 --> 00:49:15,964
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll motion to adjourn.

812
00:49:16,864 --> 00:49:17,804
[SPEAKER_04]: It's 1.52 p.m.

813
00:49:18,624 --> 00:49:19,705
[SPEAKER_04]: I second that motion.

814
00:49:19,785 --> 00:49:20,625
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

815
00:49:21,545 --> 00:49:21,905
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

816
00:49:22,906 --> 00:49:23,586
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

817
00:49:23,626 --> 00:49:26,647
[SPEAKER_05]: Hearing and seeing none, motion's been accepted.

818
00:49:26,667 --> 00:49:30,748
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what Jim used to say, you know, that's why I started saying that.

819
00:49:33,549 --> 00:49:34,509
[SPEAKER_05]: Hearing and seeing none.

820
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:35,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Hearing and seeing none.

821
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:36,530
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like Jim.

822
00:49:38,171 --> 00:49:39,551
[SPEAKER_05]: I look like him with my little, you know,

823
00:49:41,121 --> 00:49:44,124
[SPEAKER_05]: Get on here and, you know, look back.

824
00:49:44,985 --> 00:49:46,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

825
00:49:46,326 --> 00:49:47,327
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

826
00:49:47,428 --> 00:49:49,450
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see you guys have a great week.
