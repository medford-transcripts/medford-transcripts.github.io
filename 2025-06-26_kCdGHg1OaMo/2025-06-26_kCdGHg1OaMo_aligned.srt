1
00:00:00,142 --> 00:00:00,883
comment on this.

2
00:00:01,643 --> 00:00:12,273
So my concern is that we're creating a situation that could be made worse.

3
00:00:14,155 --> 00:00:16,477
Yeah, I need to double check.

4
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:23,423
I don't recall the status of whether there's already a permit issued for the sewer.

5
00:00:24,523 --> 00:00:26,764
And I know the building commissioners on vacation.

6
00:00:26,864 --> 00:00:33,687
Dennis, do you happen to know, even if there is a permit issued, if this would trigger the need for a new permit?

7
00:00:38,089 --> 00:00:38,669
Let me look it up.

8
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:39,910
OK.

9
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:44,852
I think they'll look up the current status of the permit.

10
00:00:45,954 --> 00:00:48,075
the permit as well.

11
00:00:48,656 --> 00:00:59,763
Mr. Chair, I think the question that I raised at the last meeting was about the sewer lines.

12
00:01:00,764 --> 00:01:05,547
One question was about the quality of the line, which the video seek to answer.

13
00:01:06,347 --> 00:01:09,870
But the other question is simply, where does the sewer line run?

14
00:01:10,665 --> 00:01:15,806
And that seems to be something that the city engineer should weigh in on.

15
00:01:16,466 --> 00:01:36,410
And I don't understand, I haven't seen this back and forth with the emails and what the city engineer basically declined to answer saying that it was a matter between two, but how can we as a board, I mean, we need to see where the utilities run and to be able to evaluate whether there's a detriment to

16
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:42,472
the neighborhood, you know, if there's one that's in poor condition.

17
00:01:45,654 --> 00:01:50,716
Dennis, maybe, could you reread the specific wording from the city engineer?

18
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:57,619
I just want to make sure the... I can, but I just forwarded it to you as well, so it's in your QK.

19
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,381
I don't have it yet.

20
00:02:03,502 --> 00:02:03,982
Oh, here we go.

21
00:02:06,065 --> 00:02:24,862
All right, so I don't see the original message, but the first response we see says, hi, Edmund, the engineering division will not comment regarding private property matters.

22
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:35,445
My previous email was relative to the overall building permit condition set forth by engineering water source stated on permits, some numbers.

23
00:02:36,706 --> 00:02:52,319
And then in some of the back and forth, the assistant city engineer

24
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,721
mentions that the permits themselves can be viewed on CitizenServe.

25
00:02:56,781 --> 00:03:00,902
So I'm looking for those now.

26
00:03:00,922 --> 00:03:03,123
So we have numbers for the permits.

27
00:03:05,904 --> 00:03:09,725
If I could ask a question in the meantime to Ed.

28
00:03:11,585 --> 00:03:20,128
I'm just wondering, Ed, your best understanding is that your sewer line connects to Fern Road?

29
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:28,394
I know 100% for a fact the sewer line connects from my property into their property into Fern Road.

30
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:36,479
It's a 100% video, you guys can do a site visit, I can show you the exact mark for it, for the water and the sewer.

31
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:43,524
And the gas line was already got removed from National Grid because it's a regular reasonable price to remove it.

32
00:03:43,884 --> 00:03:48,430
It costs a reasonable price to remove, but the estimates that I got in the store, they're outrageous.

33
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,532
Like you're looking between $30,000 to $40,000 to get it removed and replaced.

34
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:59,265
When I had a conversation with them, I was off the line.

35
00:03:59,285 --> 00:04:03,269
I just wanted to ask a question about the fact I don't want to get back into that discussion.

36
00:04:03,289 --> 00:04:04,090
I just want to.

37
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:08,895
So you're because your video, it was longer than the other one.

38
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:13,119
It's that's does it almost seem to me it was very straight and long.

39
00:04:13,279 --> 00:04:15,621
And are you sure it doesn't connect into the film?

40
00:04:16,543 --> 00:04:18,124
It does not connect to the Felsway.

41
00:04:18,865 --> 00:04:19,986
I'm 100% sure.

42
00:04:20,766 --> 00:04:21,967
It goes from my house.

43
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:26,571
I have it marked on my site and I got it marked from Fern Road.

44
00:04:27,011 --> 00:04:37,840
At first, we thought it connects from their house into my house and connects together and go down along the wall of the gas station into the Felsway.

45
00:04:38,501 --> 00:04:40,642
And we were under oppression, that's where the line is.

46
00:04:41,082 --> 00:04:51,848
And the first attempt of recording that line, by request from Emmett, went to a place where it's completely dry, hadn't been used in years.

47
00:04:52,649 --> 00:04:59,713
So I dug out that side of the pipe, supposedly end, and realized it comes to the wall behind the gas station.

48
00:05:00,893 --> 00:05:01,514
So I end up...

49
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:08,537
dragging out a little bit more before it used to be a front yard, and the sewer line was Nick.

50
00:05:09,118 --> 00:05:14,844
And that's when we realized it goes from my house into their house in Deferred Road.

51
00:05:15,264 --> 00:05:23,133
And the reason I thought they're connected together, because Rob was under the impression that our line and his line are connected together.

52
00:05:23,553 --> 00:05:28,914
Based on their video today, I'm going to assume that they have a separate line than mine.

53
00:05:29,234 --> 00:05:34,655
We can't, there is no way we are connected together because that's the sewer line.

54
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:39,036
I'm like a million percent sure it goes from Fern Road into my house.

55
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:43,217
And their video, it's got to be for a separate line that goes from their house.

56
00:05:45,577 --> 00:05:46,117
All right, thank you.

57
00:05:47,017 --> 00:05:47,357
Thank you.

58
00:05:47,617 --> 00:05:50,558
I mean, I just, this is kind of why I feel like

59
00:05:51,777 --> 00:05:57,159
need the city engineer to kind of tell us where the utility is.

60
00:05:57,699 --> 00:06:13,185
I mean, I mean, I see this either, you know, you know, either we deny the variance and doesn't solve the problem or we approve it and doesn't solve the problem either.

61
00:06:13,245 --> 00:06:16,406
I mean, I don't know if this is just heading to a court fight one way or the other.

62
00:06:19,096 --> 00:06:33,008
So while others have been talking, I did look up the three permits that the assistant city engineer.

63
00:06:33,568 --> 00:06:43,837
And so the only listed review of the water and sewer specifically was from May of 2023.

64
00:06:49,062 --> 00:06:54,023
Um, there have been two engineering reviews that was approved with conditions back then.

65
00:06:54,664 --> 00:07:00,905
There have been two engineering reviews, um, since then that have been approved with conditions.

66
00:07:02,026 --> 00:07:10,188
As far as I can tell, CitizenServe doesn't have super rich details about exactly what, um, those conditions are.

67
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:16,970
Um, my understanding, which Dennis can check me on, is that if the board were to issue

68
00:07:18,392 --> 00:07:41,900
uh variances on this matter that the applicant would have to pull new building permits which would trigger the need for additional engineering reviews and approvals but i'm not that's my understanding as well the other one thing which we could do is i know this was sort of prolonging this

69
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,982
One, I can go over this with Mike.

70
00:07:45,082 --> 00:07:58,212
I can draft a letter to the city engineer, Owen, and basically ask him the way requests from us might actually have a little more oomph than requests from a homeowner in this instance.

71
00:07:58,692 --> 00:08:03,696
Tell him that we kind of would like to get some settlement on this matter.

72
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:05,357
All right.

73
00:08:05,417 --> 00:08:05,918
Thanks, Dennis.

74
00:08:05,938 --> 00:08:06,218
Yeah.

75
00:08:06,258 --> 00:08:10,021
So I certainly appreciate the board's take on that.

76
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:12,423
I'll just reiterate my take from last time.

77
00:08:13,017 --> 00:08:25,347
I think even if the SOAR were in good working order, which it may or may not be, I don't see a strong legal basis to grant this variance anyway.

78
00:08:25,607 --> 00:08:28,890
So I was prepared to vote on it last time.

79
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:31,192
I'm extra prepared to vote on it now.

80
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:36,917
I'm not saying what my vote will be.

81
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:40,660
Maybe there's something we discuss in deliberation that sways that.

82
00:08:42,383 --> 00:09:02,335
to connect hardship stemming from configuring the house as a two-family versus a one-family to something unusual about the area and width of the property.

83
00:09:05,464 --> 00:09:12,489
that presenting a hardship, like that's by itself a very hard case to make.

84
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:33,667
And then when you further consider that, at least my interpretation of the intent of the zoning ordinance, is that in a GR district, you should only be allowed by right to have a two-family if you have a bigger lot than

85
00:09:35,679 --> 00:10:02,493
single family and that this is already substantially undersized for a single family and the proximity to existing structures like the the potential detriment to the public good is there it seems risky the derogation from the intent of the ordinance is there it's not clear the ordinance ever intended that we should give this release relief and the

86
00:10:03,271 --> 00:10:06,893
The hardship case is just, in my view, basically non-existent.

87
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:18,158
So I'm prepared to vote, but I'll see what others would like to do, including Dennis's offer.

88
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,881
No, we're deliberating, so there's nothing to add here.

89
00:10:32,045 --> 00:10:32,565
Mary, go ahead.

90
00:10:32,985 --> 00:10:41,188
Yeah, so based on what was expressed with the board and also the public comments, I think I am also prepared to vote.

91
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:50,591
All right, so there's a couple of potential options on the table.

92
00:10:52,232 --> 00:11:00,474
Request to continue, have Dennis send it to the engineering department, requesting further clarification or vote tonight.

93
00:11:01,095 --> 00:11:01,975
Chair awaits a motion.

94
00:11:05,176 --> 00:11:09,480
Could we just be able to hear from Jim and Chris a little bit?

95
00:11:11,342 --> 00:11:13,144
I'm prepared to vote.

96
00:11:13,164 --> 00:11:16,227
Mr. Chair, I don't know.

97
00:11:16,247 --> 00:11:17,969
Honestly, I don't.

98
00:11:24,754 --> 00:11:30,756
think this, I am actually inclined to grant the variance.

99
00:11:31,497 --> 00:11:40,621
The concern of mine is the same that I had a few minutes ago, which is that we don't have clarity on this.

100
00:11:41,461 --> 00:11:44,902
And I would like the city engineer to weigh in on it.

101
00:11:45,002 --> 00:11:53,586
So I'm not sure, you know, taking the pulse of everyone that's here, maybe that's a

102
00:11:55,804 --> 00:12:23,710
Maybe that's a waste of time, but I see this as the builder, the neighbors will be, they won't necessarily be in a substantial detriment by dividing that existing square footage.

103
00:12:24,868 --> 00:12:51,402
so uh and the owner of the house the applicant could then keep even doing adu within the structure of the house if he were denied here so that is all staying the same in my mind um it's already there if it were not there i probably would not have voted to allow it but it's there so um

104
00:12:52,661 --> 00:12:53,682
That's my call.

105
00:12:54,042 --> 00:13:02,909
I would prefer to vote on something that had more clarity in terms of what the end result will be.

106
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:05,250
Yeah, thanks, Chris.

107
00:13:05,671 --> 00:13:08,353
And I would prefer to do so as well.

108
00:13:08,753 --> 00:13:13,036
And we do still have the option to continue this and request more information.

109
00:13:13,997 --> 00:13:18,120
We did provide a very specific request for information.

110
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:22,283
And the current info we have is no further clarity on the

111
00:13:23,031 --> 00:13:32,059
location of the line, miscommunication, and the position of the Assistant City Engineer is that they're not going to comment on it.

112
00:13:32,139 --> 00:13:44,610
So maybe Dennis is able to clarify and that changes, but it is entirely possible we will be here a month from now in roughly the present state.

113
00:13:46,112 --> 00:13:46,252
But

114
00:13:47,263 --> 00:13:48,164
We don't know that for sure.

115
00:13:48,204 --> 00:13:49,425
So sure.

116
00:13:49,485 --> 00:13:50,206
Go ahead, Andre.

117
00:13:50,426 --> 00:13:53,549
Well, I was just going to say, I mean, it seems like a majority of the board is ready to vote.

118
00:13:53,609 --> 00:13:53,910
So.

119
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:56,372
All right.

120
00:13:56,412 --> 00:13:57,533
Chair awaits a motion.

121
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:05,562
Motion to vote on whether.

122
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:07,544
So you can technically.

123
00:14:08,344 --> 00:14:10,807
So you're supposed to motion to approve or deny.

124
00:14:11,496 --> 00:14:15,579
You making the motion doesn't actually indicate which way you vote.

125
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:18,340
It just indicates what a yes means and a no means.

126
00:14:18,421 --> 00:14:21,983
So as a best practice, I recommend motions to approve.

127
00:14:22,943 --> 00:14:26,626
And then that way, a no means no, I don't approve.

128
00:14:26,846 --> 00:14:28,347
And a yes means yes, I do approve.

129
00:14:29,648 --> 00:14:31,349
But you can also do the opposite.

130
00:14:31,429 --> 00:14:33,450
So chair awaits a motion.

131
00:14:37,053 --> 00:14:38,934
So motion to approve.

132
00:14:40,473 --> 00:14:47,275
Okay, so motion to approve the variances for 289 Bellesway West.

133
00:14:47,335 --> 00:14:47,975
Do I have a second?

134
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:58,118
This is meaning that we don't get clarity though, right?

135
00:14:58,158 --> 00:14:58,519
Correct.

136
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,540
I'll second.

137
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,661
So we're going to take a vote.

138
00:15:09,562 --> 00:15:09,822
Andre?

139
00:15:10,967 --> 00:15:15,228
So just to clarify, yes is no is denied.

140
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:16,248
Andre?

141
00:15:16,908 --> 00:15:17,088
No.

142
00:15:18,388 --> 00:15:18,748
Mary?

143
00:15:19,368 --> 00:15:19,608
No.

144
00:15:20,589 --> 00:15:20,909
Chris?

145
00:15:21,929 --> 00:15:22,229
Yes.

146
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:23,489
Jim?

147
00:15:24,129 --> 00:15:24,349
No.

148
00:15:25,609 --> 00:15:26,230
Mike, no.

149
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,270
So four yeses were required.

150
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:31,490
We have one yes, four noes.

151
00:15:32,931 --> 00:15:34,991
So the petition is denied.

152
00:15:35,011 --> 00:15:39,732
And then we will work on a decision.

153
00:15:41,684 --> 00:16:09,978
uh to record this but um but yeah the the project can't go forward as proposed so just it's next for me now so maybe jump in like yeah okay so and i'll write up a decision once it's written it'll get checked by our legal folks and then after it's signed by the members it gets uh

154
00:16:11,602 --> 00:16:19,387
you know, submit filed at the city clerk's office, I'll get you, I'll get you a copy of that signed version stamped by the city clerk.

155
00:16:19,407 --> 00:16:21,849
So at that point, there's a 20 days appeals period after.

156
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:26,592
And so the period would be to the land court, I believe, right then.

157
00:16:27,293 --> 00:16:29,054
Yeah, it wouldn't, it doesn't get appealed to us anymore.

158
00:16:29,074 --> 00:16:29,754
It's out of our hands.

159
00:16:29,834 --> 00:16:32,817
It would go to a state court at that point for if you want to appeal.

160
00:16:33,977 --> 00:16:34,338
Thank you.

161
00:16:35,318 --> 00:16:35,899
All right.

162
00:16:36,219 --> 00:16:36,659
Thanks folks.

163
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:37,900
What's next?

164
00:16:43,749 --> 00:16:48,252
100 Dartmouth Street, case number 8-2025-10.

165
00:16:48,412 --> 00:16:56,498
Appoint an owner, George Dedek, to construct a two-car garage at one zoning district within the front yard setback on Wellesley Street, which is not allowed per the City of Medford Zoning Ordinance.

166
00:16:57,659 --> 00:16:58,399
All right, thank you.

167
00:16:58,619 --> 00:17:05,744
And since we do have six, I'm just going to designate everyone except for me as voting in this matter.

168
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:06,765
So I will chair it.

169
00:17:06,865 --> 00:17:09,567
But we will have Jim, Mary, Andre, and Chris.

170
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:19,302
So, do we have a representative present for the applicant?

171
00:17:22,023 --> 00:17:23,083
Yes.

172
00:17:23,103 --> 00:17:23,743
Hi.

173
00:17:24,484 --> 00:17:27,565
My name is Chris Dedick and this is my father, George Dedick.

174
00:17:29,045 --> 00:17:31,866
He'll be speaking mostly, but I might also help.

175
00:17:31,906 --> 00:17:36,788
He's deaf, so I might have to, you know, help along the way.

176
00:17:37,228 --> 00:17:37,628
But, yeah.

177
00:17:37,768 --> 00:17:39,889
All right.

178
00:17:40,009 --> 00:17:40,589
Well, welcome.

179
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:41,950
Please go ahead.

180
00:17:42,415 --> 00:17:47,666
So as we understand it, you want to build a garage.

181
00:17:47,686 --> 00:17:49,610
So can you tell us a little bit about the project?

182
00:17:50,589 --> 00:17:51,230
Uh, yeah, sure.

183
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:52,831
Um, do you want to talk?

184
00:17:52,851 --> 00:17:53,411
You want me to talk?

185
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:54,031
Go ahead.

186
00:17:54,051 --> 00:17:54,131
Okay.

187
00:17:54,151 --> 00:17:55,432
Yeah, I can, I can go for it.

188
00:17:55,672 --> 00:18:02,537
Um, so he wants to construct, um, a two car garage in his backyard and it's a corner lot.

189
00:18:02,917 --> 00:18:08,080
So basically like the side setback in a corner lot would, or would be 15 feet.

190
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:13,204
Um, and he wants to make it three feet, um, to make it so the width of the garage will be 22 feet.

191
00:18:13,284 --> 00:18:14,345
So it's a two car garage.

192
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:16,966
Um, so he just needs that relief.

193
00:18:17,607 --> 00:18:17,727
Um,

194
00:18:19,109 --> 00:18:20,290
from 15 to three.

195
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:26,075
And then I can pull up, if you want me to pull up the site plan, I can pull that up if you want.

196
00:18:26,455 --> 00:18:27,576
Yeah, that sounds great.

197
00:18:27,836 --> 00:18:28,056
Sure.

198
00:18:42,548 --> 00:18:44,009
Yeah, you guys can see that?

199
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:46,411
Yes, we can.

200
00:18:49,548 --> 00:18:54,911
Yeah, so, uh, he would need, uh, and then the backfield here is the Tufts.

201
00:18:55,531 --> 00:18:57,772
Um, it's a Tufts field, um, in the back.

202
00:18:58,693 --> 00:19:01,254
Um, and then one neighbor on this side.

203
00:19:01,274 --> 00:19:06,737
Um, and then, yeah, so it was just, this would be three feet as, um, shown here.

204
00:19:06,757 --> 00:19:12,600
And then he has the required, so he wouldn't need, um, I don't think he would need any variants there.

205
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,301
Okay.

206
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:16,462
And so, um,

207
00:19:18,303 --> 00:19:20,184
How does one access this garage?

208
00:19:20,224 --> 00:19:23,186
It's a little unclear to me if there's a curb cut somewhere.

209
00:19:23,206 --> 00:19:27,328
Yeah, so there should be a curb cut right here.

210
00:19:27,348 --> 00:19:29,009
I think it's a 20-foot curb cut.

211
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:31,051
Okay.

212
00:19:34,092 --> 00:19:34,693
On Wellesley.

213
00:19:35,536 --> 00:19:38,017
And is there a separate curb cut on Dartmouth Street?

214
00:19:38,698 --> 00:19:44,720
Yeah, so he has a garage right here, four car garage.

215
00:19:44,881 --> 00:19:49,463
And then he has a roughly, I don't know the exact, has a roughly 20 foot curb cut about here.

216
00:19:55,946 --> 00:19:58,067
Other questions so far from the board?

217
00:20:05,221 --> 00:20:07,342
Yeah, Mr. Chair, Andre, I have a question.

218
00:20:09,664 --> 00:20:17,348
I'm just curious why you need another 2-car garage if you already have a 4-car garage?

219
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:28,375
Yeah, so he has a permit submitted to the city currently where he's turning this 4-car garage into a second unit.

220
00:20:28,915 --> 00:20:32,057
So then therefore, he would lose all of his parking, basically.

221
00:20:34,288 --> 00:20:34,588
Got it.

222
00:20:34,648 --> 00:20:43,056
Thank you.

223
00:20:43,536 --> 00:20:51,003
And so have you discussed the extra curb cut with the city engineering department or the DBW?

224
00:20:51,263 --> 00:20:52,584
The second curb cut?

225
00:20:56,696 --> 00:21:00,563
Have you talked to the Medford Engineering Department?

226
00:21:01,244 --> 00:21:04,030
I think Owen, maybe?

227
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:06,013
Oh yeah, I did talk to him.

228
00:21:06,033 --> 00:21:07,456
He says, yeah, you need it.

229
00:21:09,961 --> 00:21:11,362
Chuck send that in and that's it.

230
00:21:11,382 --> 00:21:13,303
There was nothing done after that.

231
00:21:13,383 --> 00:21:15,204
I don't know if you could hear him.

232
00:21:15,304 --> 00:21:19,266
He said that he spoke with Owen and Owen said, of course, you need it.

233
00:21:19,706 --> 00:21:28,191
And then he my father said he went and got plans drawn up from Medford Engineering for the curb cut.

234
00:21:29,965 --> 00:21:30,405
I'm not sure.

235
00:21:30,505 --> 00:21:33,347
I don't think those have been submitted for the curb cut yet.

236
00:21:33,407 --> 00:21:39,711
I'm not, I'm not sure the process, how that works, um, if that was supposed to be done prior to this or post this or at the same time.

237
00:21:40,151 --> 00:21:40,592
Um, but yeah.

238
00:21:41,992 --> 00:21:42,393
Yeah.

239
00:21:42,493 --> 00:21:57,202
So the only thing, um, that might be helpful for us to know that I can think of that you haven't already shared is I know that the,

240
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:14,648
City is generally taking the position that properties with a curb cut should not get a set impact on street parking, among other things.

241
00:22:14,668 --> 00:22:21,451
And so here, we don't govern the approvals for that.

242
00:22:21,491 --> 00:22:25,513
It would basically imply that a second

243
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,082
curve cuts required.

244
00:22:28,824 --> 00:22:33,070
You're intending to convert the existing garage.

245
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:42,683
But yeah, am I correctly understanding you're not proposing removing the curve cut and

246
00:22:43,405 --> 00:22:45,646
repurposing what's currently parking?

247
00:22:45,686 --> 00:22:46,106
No, no.

248
00:22:46,207 --> 00:22:55,071
Yeah, because there's still going to be a few parking spaces for two parking spaces for like this said unit in front of like in the driveway right here.

249
00:22:55,592 --> 00:22:55,832
Got it.

250
00:22:56,952 --> 00:23:00,254
And I would like, I can just touch upon Wellesley Street.

251
00:23:01,435 --> 00:23:05,457
If that part's not permitted, and it's

252
00:23:05,957 --> 00:23:12,200
I guess like a private road kind of where it's just like a dirt side with the fence.

253
00:23:12,921 --> 00:23:17,623
So there's technically not supposed to be parking there anyway.

254
00:23:17,643 --> 00:23:21,025
That's not like a curb sidewalk that you're allowed to park on.

255
00:23:21,045 --> 00:23:24,286
I see.

256
00:23:24,627 --> 00:23:26,588
If you guys, I'm not sure if you're familiar with that area.

257
00:23:27,128 --> 00:23:30,910
I think people get it because it doesn't have a designated curb.

258
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:35,292
It's still a side of the street that's parking available.

259
00:23:37,658 --> 00:23:41,119
I would argue, though, that you're moving more people into this building.

260
00:23:41,239 --> 00:23:45,081
And so you would essentially already be bringing cars.

261
00:23:45,101 --> 00:23:48,523
So you would be taking up those spots that currently exist.

262
00:23:49,163 --> 00:23:50,544
And so you're bringing them in.

263
00:23:51,324 --> 00:23:52,705
So it would be one for one.

264
00:23:52,825 --> 00:23:53,105
Right.

265
00:23:53,125 --> 00:23:56,367
I would say you're not you're still not losing it.

266
00:23:56,407 --> 00:24:05,511
But I wouldn't say straight out that you're you're going to that that's not parking because that's not right either.

267
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,622
Yeah, no, I mean, I'm not saying it's like not parking.

268
00:24:09,763 --> 00:24:12,905
It's just not like, I guess, like the atypical what you would think of.

269
00:24:13,426 --> 00:24:19,250
And I don't know how the city like deems it as like a private way, but they don't like repair that road for some reason.

270
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:21,472
I'm not, I'm not gonna get into that part.

271
00:24:21,492 --> 00:24:21,852
But yeah.

272
00:24:23,794 --> 00:24:28,037
Yeah, so it's, it's a bit complicated.

273
00:24:28,097 --> 00:24:30,059
I mean, if we need to go down the rabbit hole, we can.

274
00:24:30,139 --> 00:24:35,363
But I think the short version of it is my understanding is that even as a private

275
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:43,386
way the public can and does park along Wellesley Street.

276
00:24:44,027 --> 00:24:52,173
But yeah, Yvette, to your point, it's the reconfiguration of the house does on average imply adding cars.

277
00:24:52,994 --> 00:24:57,898
So I think that's a fair point.

278
00:24:58,338 --> 00:25:02,822
Okay, other questions from members of the board?

279
00:25:04,251 --> 00:25:17,755
I would ask just about that curb cut or the paveway leading onto the street to the applicant's point that that side of the street is a little more less kept.

280
00:25:18,515 --> 00:25:24,677
Is there going to be a driveway that leads all the way to the street that will be cleaning up all that stuff or is it still going to be a dirt path?

281
00:25:24,697 --> 00:25:33,380
He would pave from his property to the garage door or whatever all the way up until the asphalted street.

282
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:37,232
So then where does trash go?

283
00:25:38,613 --> 00:25:40,294
I feel like I'm always asking the trash question.

284
00:25:41,875 --> 00:25:45,257
So if you now have two spaces, where did it go?

285
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:47,739
And now where does it go?

286
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:53,163
Along the side of his fence over here, he has his two barrels for his current single family.

287
00:25:53,263 --> 00:25:56,165
So he would just put the four barrels total,

288
00:25:56,965 --> 00:25:59,686
two-track, two-recycling in the same spot.

289
00:26:00,026 --> 00:26:13,212
Him himself would come down the stairs in the exact same way that he does it now, and then the new tenant's front door is going to be here as well, and then they would also just come right over to the side by the fence.

290
00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:18,414
It still gets picked up in front of Dartmouth, not the other side of the street.

291
00:26:18,654 --> 00:26:19,134
Exactly.

292
00:26:19,814 --> 00:26:25,497
The property address is 100 Dartmouth, and then the front door for both units will be on 100 Dartmouth.

293
00:26:29,375 --> 00:26:37,419
And then the way he's planning on using the garage, this is gonna be solely, like this is his back door and it's gonna stay.

294
00:26:37,439 --> 00:26:41,780
And then he's gonna, him and my mother are gonna use this garage.

295
00:26:42,141 --> 00:26:45,042
And then basically like, they'll just go from the garage into the back door.

296
00:26:45,482 --> 00:26:51,144
And then the new other unit that's gonna be like on the right would just have like the driveway spots.

297
00:26:55,206 --> 00:26:56,947
So this is that is gonna benefit

298
00:26:57,896 --> 00:27:01,968
the owner to make it easier for them to get in and out, right?

299
00:27:02,048 --> 00:27:04,876
Because that is someone who needs maybe

300
00:27:06,863 --> 00:27:35,066
closer spot right instead of doing like a handicap spot or something or in the future that might be needed right we need to like think about that exactly you know my parents they're senior citizens so of course they you know the closer to the you know this is only I think four stairs maybe in the front is whatever seven or something so it's less stairs to get into the house for them as well so it is beneficial for them and then I

301
00:27:36,449 --> 00:27:44,790
It retains that their second unit or the other apartment that they're trying to build would also get two parking spaces.

302
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:48,871
So each tenant, therefore, would have two parking spaces.

303
00:27:55,472 --> 00:27:56,032
Mary, go ahead.

304
00:27:56,333 --> 00:27:57,153
Yeah.

305
00:27:57,273 --> 00:28:00,293
Do you mind pulling up the Google view for this?

306
00:28:00,513 --> 00:28:02,134
Is it a red house?

307
00:28:03,274 --> 00:28:04,534
Yeah, like reddish wood.

308
00:28:07,149 --> 00:28:11,713
Yeah, I don't see I don't see where the proposed garage is.

309
00:28:11,793 --> 00:28:13,535
I always see just one side of the house.

310
00:28:14,115 --> 00:28:14,355
Sure.

311
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:21,862
So this is their house right here.

312
00:28:23,263 --> 00:28:25,325
So the garage would be right here.

313
00:28:25,785 --> 00:28:34,593
So three feet away from the Tufts field and 10 feet away from their like backyard or the back of their house.

314
00:28:37,133 --> 00:28:38,473
And then did you want the street view?

315
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:40,134
Yes, please.

316
00:28:40,494 --> 00:28:40,734
Okay.

317
00:28:45,136 --> 00:28:49,017
So this is the back of their house or so wrong way.

318
00:28:55,439 --> 00:28:57,579
So it's kind of hard to say but yeah, three.

319
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,160
Sorry about that.

320
00:29:05,182 --> 00:29:05,342
Okay.

321
00:29:06,535 --> 00:29:10,737
Yeah, so 3 feet from this fence and then 10 feet from like this house.

322
00:29:10,777 --> 00:29:15,799
So it would basically be like, kind of where that like, what fence structure is right?

323
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:16,440
Thank you.

324
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:17,340
Yep.

325
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,602
And then as you can, like, of course, the people use this, but.

326
00:29:21,562 --> 00:29:23,083
Yeah, take it for what it's worth, I suppose.

327
00:29:28,746 --> 00:29:31,547
Right other questions from the board.

328
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:52,390
All right, so before we open for public comment, I just want to describe the process the board has to follow for the requested relief.

329
00:29:52,510 --> 00:30:02,739
So because this is too close in the side yard, I think that if I'm

330
00:30:03,522 --> 00:30:12,409
understanding correctly, because it's next to this field at Tufts, the backyard isn't triggered, but certainly the side yard is too close.

331
00:30:12,469 --> 00:30:26,259
So the board would have to establish that due to circumstances pertaining to the shape, topography or soil conditions of a lot of structures that aren't generated,

332
00:30:28,082 --> 00:30:33,464
It would create a hardship if we literally enforced the zoning ordinance and didn't grant the requested relief.

333
00:30:33,544 --> 00:30:47,928
So the structures are positioned on the lot such that there's no eligible forming and logical location to place a garage.

334
00:30:48,468 --> 00:30:55,470
That would be one example of a situation where the board might decide that that's unusual circumstances.

335
00:30:57,666 --> 00:30:58,587
that create a hardship.

336
00:30:58,867 --> 00:31:13,400
So yeah, if you do have any argument you'd like to make about the hardship that would be imposed if the board didn't really enforce the zoning ordinance, now would be a good time.

337
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:15,401
So what would happen if you didn't get the relief?

338
00:31:15,501 --> 00:31:17,303
Could you place a garage anywhere?

339
00:31:18,158 --> 00:31:21,139
Um, so we wouldn't be able to place a garage anywhere.

340
00:31:21,439 --> 00:31:27,160
And then therefore that he wouldn't meet the parking requirements for his second unit either.

341
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:32,701
So he wouldn't meet that hardship of not being able to convert as well, when the time comes.

342
00:31:34,162 --> 00:31:34,462
Got it.

343
00:31:34,882 --> 00:31:35,142
Okay.

344
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:44,064
So just so I'm clear the plans before us, this is a single family, and you're proposing

345
00:31:44,863 --> 00:31:46,343
a garage in this location.

346
00:31:46,363 --> 00:31:47,204
Correct.

347
00:31:47,484 --> 00:31:50,945
But the intention is that eventually you do a conversion.

348
00:31:50,965 --> 00:31:57,047
So that's yeah, that those plans have already been submitted and are working their way through approval.

349
00:31:57,547 --> 00:31:57,827
Got it.

350
00:31:58,107 --> 00:32:01,248
Okay.

351
00:32:01,328 --> 00:32:03,589
Other questions from the board?

352
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:08,590
I'm going to open it up to public comment.

353
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:12,911
If you're a member of the public and would like to speak on this matter, you may do so now.

354
00:32:13,832 --> 00:32:14,332
You can

355
00:32:16,537 --> 00:32:23,623
raise your hand on Zoom, turn on your camera, raise your hand, type something in the chat, or you can email Dennis, dmcdougal at medford-ma.gov.

356
00:32:23,843 --> 00:32:25,284
Chris, I'm going to drop the screen share, too.

357
00:32:25,764 --> 00:32:26,305
Okay, thank you.

358
00:32:37,233 --> 00:32:37,534
Great.

359
00:32:37,734 --> 00:32:41,517
I'm not seeing any members of the public who would like to speak on this matter.

360
00:32:43,173 --> 00:32:50,559
So the chair awaits a motion to close the public portion of the hearing and motion to close the public portion of the hearing and debate.

361
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,060
All right.

362
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:52,761
Do I have a second?

363
00:32:55,443 --> 00:32:55,783
Second.

364
00:32:56,824 --> 00:32:57,164
All right.

365
00:32:57,384 --> 00:32:58,665
We're going to take a roll call.

366
00:32:58,705 --> 00:32:59,046
Jim?

367
00:32:59,746 --> 00:33:00,026
Aye.

368
00:33:00,487 --> 00:33:00,907
Mary?

369
00:33:00,927 --> 00:33:00,987
Aye.

370
00:33:02,328 --> 00:33:02,809
Andre?

371
00:33:02,829 --> 00:33:03,349
Aye.

372
00:33:03,869 --> 00:33:04,210
Chris?

373
00:33:05,331 --> 00:33:05,511
Aye.

374
00:33:05,891 --> 00:33:06,231
Yvette?

375
00:33:07,192 --> 00:33:07,332
Aye.

376
00:33:08,033 --> 00:33:08,353
All right.

377
00:33:08,933 --> 00:33:09,974
We are now deliberating.

378
00:33:10,014 --> 00:33:10,755
What do you think, folks?

379
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:20,530
100.

380
00:33:15,068 --> 00:33:20,530
I think that they have enough square footage to put a second unit in this.

381
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:28,373
I think that this garage would be the only location to put it.

382
00:33:28,533 --> 00:33:33,996
It would be, I think, a hardship to try to locate parking on the site in any other location.

383
00:33:34,016 --> 00:33:37,097
All right.

384
00:33:37,397 --> 00:33:38,097
Thank you, Andre.

385
00:33:38,197 --> 00:33:39,338
Other thoughts from the board?

386
00:33:49,622 --> 00:34:04,614
Mr. Chair, I also agree if they're going to have parking requirements for the second year, and they obviously have to put it somewhere on the property and I'm inclined to approve.

387
00:34:05,335 --> 00:34:06,696
Sad to see that garden go though.

388
00:34:07,897 --> 00:34:11,219
Oh, they'll still have a plenty big enough garden.

389
00:34:13,343 --> 00:34:16,086
All right, Yvette, it looked like you were going to say something as well.

390
00:34:17,046 --> 00:34:34,822
I was just going to add that I actually think it would be a detriment to the neighbors because then, again, there might be a hardship for parking, to find the parking for owners themselves, I think, besides it being a burden to move.

391
00:34:35,583 --> 00:34:40,648
You'd lose a lot more of the yard if you had to put it elsewhere on the lots where it would go.

392
00:34:41,687 --> 00:34:50,389
And also for the door, for the owners themselves, I think it's an improvement for their lives as well as, again, the neighborhood.

393
00:34:50,409 --> 00:34:54,310
All right.

394
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:56,571
Other thoughts from the board?

395
00:35:10,894 --> 00:35:11,254
Andre?

396
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:16,822
a motion to approve the variances for 100 Dartmouth Street.

397
00:35:17,662 --> 00:35:20,703
All right, we're going to take a roll call.

398
00:35:20,783 --> 00:35:21,283
Mary?

399
00:35:21,303 --> 00:35:22,043
Aye.

400
00:35:22,604 --> 00:35:22,984
Chris?

401
00:35:23,564 --> 00:35:23,704
Aye.

402
00:35:24,284 --> 00:35:24,624
Yvette?

403
00:35:25,925 --> 00:35:26,045
Aye.

404
00:35:26,565 --> 00:35:26,925
Jim?

405
00:35:27,565 --> 00:35:27,685
Aye.

406
00:35:28,386 --> 00:35:28,746
Andre?

407
00:35:28,766 --> 00:35:29,386
Aye.

408
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:31,387
This is approved.

409
00:35:32,327 --> 00:35:35,488
So Dennis, we'll go ahead and

410
00:35:36,665 --> 00:35:43,330
draft the language on the decision, and then you'd walk them through the next steps, then?

411
00:35:44,491 --> 00:35:45,072
Yep, exactly.

412
00:35:45,112 --> 00:35:46,273
So, Jordan, Chris.

413
00:35:46,553 --> 00:35:47,694
So I'll write up the decision.

414
00:35:47,834 --> 00:35:50,096
It'll get reviewed by our legal counsel.

415
00:35:50,756 --> 00:35:52,478
And then it'll come back to me.

416
00:35:52,538 --> 00:35:54,039
I'll send it off to the board for signatures.

417
00:35:54,159 --> 00:35:57,141
Once we get the signatures, I'll file it in the clerk's office.

418
00:35:58,122 --> 00:36:04,608
And at that point, so that's probably still a few weeks away from now, at that point, there's a 20 days appeals period.

419
00:36:05,493 --> 00:36:09,676
And once those 20 days are done, then you can go and get your permit.

420
00:36:10,156 --> 00:36:10,697
Okay, perfect.

421
00:36:10,777 --> 00:36:17,762
So the time from now to getting the permit is probably about a month and a half away or so give or take give or take, you know, schedule something so much.

422
00:36:17,782 --> 00:36:18,042
All right.

423
00:36:18,082 --> 00:36:18,322
Thank you.

424
00:36:18,362 --> 00:36:21,945
And I said we had a follow up question about the curb cut.

425
00:36:22,005 --> 00:36:27,388
So that's not through here that way he would just go to the engineering department and apply for it.

426
00:36:28,489 --> 00:36:29,630
Yeah, right.

427
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:31,751
So the issue a permit for that.

428
00:36:31,771 --> 00:36:32,272
Okay.

429
00:36:34,142 --> 00:36:39,586
Like I said, my understanding is they're not general fans of the double curb cut.

430
00:36:39,767 --> 00:36:42,489
And for a lot of the buy right stuff, they're denying it.

431
00:36:42,569 --> 00:36:54,238
But I also understand that they tend to be reluctant to deny permits in cases where the zoning board approved something because it would basically kill the project.

432
00:36:54,278 --> 00:36:56,200
So ultimately, that's for them to decide.

433
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,643
And we can't condition our decision on that.

434
00:36:59,743 --> 00:37:00,764
All right, perfect.

435
00:37:00,784 --> 00:37:01,184
All right.

436
00:37:01,224 --> 00:37:01,744
Thank you very much.

437
00:37:01,784 --> 00:37:02,405
Appreciate your time.

438
00:37:04,578 --> 00:37:04,858
Thank you.

439
00:37:05,038 --> 00:37:05,198
Thanks.

440
00:37:05,418 --> 00:37:07,260
Have a good night.

441
00:37:08,161 --> 00:37:10,543
What's next.

442
00:37:10,803 --> 00:37:23,574
76 Greenleaf Avenue case number a dash 2025 dash 11 applicant and owner Russell Robar to provide massage therapy services 76 Greenleaf Avenue single family home a single family to district, not allowed for the city of Bedford zoning ordinance.

443
00:37:25,104 --> 00:37:25,364
All right.

444
00:37:25,664 --> 00:37:26,425
Um, thanks.

445
00:37:26,485 --> 00:37:31,849
And Dennis, just before we get started, I want to double check, um, the requested relief here.

446
00:37:32,009 --> 00:37:37,333
So this is a request for a special permit for an accessory use.

447
00:37:37,373 --> 00:37:37,873
Is that right?

448
00:37:39,735 --> 00:37:49,842
That's the way I, that's the way we sort of, we just, let me just give me one half second to call up the technical serve to see if there's any extra comments on it.

449
00:37:51,403 --> 00:37:51,603
Right.

450
00:37:51,663 --> 00:37:53,805
Well, while you're doing that, Dennis, we can, um,

451
00:37:54,818 --> 00:37:57,541
we can let the applicant get started.

452
00:37:57,721 --> 00:38:00,864
So I see we have a Russell Robar on the call.

453
00:38:02,825 --> 00:38:04,707
Are you here to speak on this matter, Russell?

454
00:38:10,633 --> 00:38:10,933
Yes.

455
00:38:10,953 --> 00:38:11,513
Hi everybody.

456
00:38:11,534 --> 00:38:12,214
Thanks for your time.

457
00:38:12,234 --> 00:38:13,175
Hi.

458
00:38:13,756 --> 00:38:14,176
Good evening.

459
00:38:15,837 --> 00:38:18,600
I've been a licensed massage therapist for over 30 years.

460
00:38:20,618 --> 00:38:31,388
And I primarily work downtown, but my wife and I, we do have a guest bedroom in our house and I work on my family.

461
00:38:32,629 --> 00:38:41,477
And I have a lot of clients that come in from outside of the city, convenient for them to just drive in.

462
00:38:41,697 --> 00:38:46,562
We have two parking, guest parking permits and park in front of the house and come up

463
00:38:48,472 --> 00:38:53,876
I still need to get a solo establishment license from the state.

464
00:38:54,757 --> 00:39:04,964
So they still will come in and look at the room and make sure that it is passes their criteria.

465
00:39:05,245 --> 00:39:07,887
But the first thing that I need is a business license.

466
00:39:08,447 --> 00:39:09,388
And that's why I'm here.

467
00:39:10,989 --> 00:39:11,830
Okay, got it.

468
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:14,932
And so am I correctly understanding that

469
00:39:16,229 --> 00:39:27,335
you would need the board to grant this special permit for the accessory use to get that business license, and then you'd need that to bring to the state?

470
00:39:28,515 --> 00:39:28,955
Correct.

471
00:39:29,015 --> 00:39:44,003
I have to then apply for solo establishment license to the state, and then they send an inspector to inspect the location, the room, to make sure that it passes their criteria, so that then I can get a solo establishment license.

472
00:39:44,751 --> 00:39:48,492
So it still has to be passed by the state as well.

473
00:39:51,613 --> 00:39:56,055
And so the board may have some questions.

474
00:39:56,115 --> 00:39:58,155
Oh, by the way, I'm going to act as last time.

475
00:39:58,235 --> 00:40:00,896
So everyone except for me is voting.

476
00:40:03,357 --> 00:40:11,840
So for accessory uses, or sorry, from home occupations,

477
00:40:13,403 --> 00:40:16,284
Um, there's some that are allowed as a right.

478
00:40:16,324 --> 00:40:18,164
There's some that require a special permit.

479
00:40:18,904 --> 00:40:22,345
My understanding is that this one does require a special permit.

480
00:40:23,165 --> 00:40:42,068
And so, um, the requirements are that the home occupation be conducted solely within, uh, the dwelling by the person's occupying that dwelling as a primary residence, that, uh, the use is incidental.

481
00:40:44,689 --> 00:41:09,077
to the property, so it's primarily a residential property and this is secondary use, that the use doesn't produce offensive noise, vibration, smoke, dust, odors, heat, lighting, electrical interference, radioactive pollution, that there's no regular sale of wares of goods on the premise, that it does not utilize exterior storage of material or equipment,

482
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:31,396
and that there's no more than two non-resident employees, that there's no exterior indication of the presence other than a sign or nameplate in compliance with the sign ordinance.

483
00:41:35,499 --> 00:41:38,282
And so if all of those conditions are met,

484
00:41:39,018 --> 00:41:54,249
then the Board of Appeals can grant a special permit subject to conditions including but not limited to restricting the hours of operation, the maximum floor area, the off-street parking, and the maximum number of daily customer or other vehicle trips.

485
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:59,253
And that permit terminates with transfer of ownership of the property.

486
00:42:01,515 --> 00:42:04,877
So, just wanted the Board to have that context.

487
00:42:06,352 --> 00:42:14,257
So I'll just have probably six clients a day, one an hour, so six cars a day.

488
00:42:14,277 --> 00:42:17,819
And like I said, we have guest permit parking out front.

489
00:42:17,959 --> 00:42:22,361
So it's not really going to affect the street at all.

490
00:42:23,562 --> 00:42:28,765
And so do you already know what your intended hours of operation are?

491
00:42:29,525 --> 00:42:30,826
Typically, I'm like 10 to 6.

492
00:42:31,126 --> 00:42:32,927
So 10 to 6?

493
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:33,988
10 AM to 6 PM.

494
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:40,521
And is this, uh, on a, is, is the day of the week already one?

495
00:42:40,681 --> 00:42:42,242
On a Monday.

496
00:42:42,402 --> 00:42:43,523
I work during the week.

497
00:42:43,743 --> 00:42:44,743
I don't work on the weekends.

498
00:42:45,544 --> 00:42:45,844
I see.

499
00:42:46,444 --> 00:42:49,025
So Mondays end to six.

500
00:42:49,686 --> 00:42:49,886
Yeah.

501
00:42:50,786 --> 00:42:54,308
Um, one customer per hour.

502
00:42:55,048 --> 00:42:55,789
Approximately.

503
00:42:55,809 --> 00:42:55,949
Yeah.

504
00:42:56,209 --> 00:42:56,769
Absolutely.

505
00:42:56,789 --> 00:43:05,714
So you anticipate, uh, roughly six, um, maybe more on some days, but, um,

506
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,981
you'd be working for the eight hours, 10 a.m.

507
00:43:09,101 --> 00:43:10,121
to 6 p.m.

508
00:43:10,281 --> 00:43:10,621
Correct.

509
00:43:11,441 --> 00:43:16,642
I'd say not more than like eight people, but again, it's, I can only work on one person at a time.

510
00:43:17,102 --> 00:43:19,223
So one person will show up and one person will leave.

511
00:43:19,283 --> 00:43:22,164
So, and we have two guest parking permits.

512
00:43:23,404 --> 00:43:23,704
Okay.

513
00:43:25,504 --> 00:43:28,925
My wife and I have a driveway, so our cars are in the driveway.

514
00:43:28,945 --> 00:43:31,146
Yeah.

515
00:43:31,566 --> 00:43:33,166
Um, questions from the board.

516
00:43:39,358 --> 00:43:40,759
Andre.

517
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:41,960
Yeah.

518
00:43:43,522 --> 00:43:45,043
Do you have a waiting area?

519
00:43:45,063 --> 00:43:55,012
Typically, what I'm going to do is just have them wait in the car, because I need to bring out the guest permit.

520
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:59,897
I'll have them wait in the car, go out, give them the permit, walk them into the room.

521
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:02,079
Thanks.

522
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,182
Other questions from the board?

523
00:44:07,151 --> 00:44:18,761
Would there ever be a time where you would just leave your cars on the street and let the guests park in the driveway?

524
00:44:21,103 --> 00:44:24,306
I don't see that happening because we have the guest permit.

525
00:44:24,346 --> 00:44:31,812
So they would just, it's actually easier for them because we're the main entrance to the door.

526
00:44:34,987 --> 00:44:40,972
Guest bedrooms up the flight of stairs that are closest to the main entrance, and they just come in and walk up the stairs.

527
00:44:41,652 --> 00:44:44,335
And literally, you walk across the hall into the guest bedroom.

528
00:44:44,575 --> 00:44:47,177
So it's actually easier from the street.

529
00:44:47,998 --> 00:44:51,821
I mean, we could do that, but I don't think that would happen.

530
00:44:51,841 --> 00:45:00,868
And how do you anticipate handling a snow emergency?

531
00:45:03,581 --> 00:45:05,002
No one would come.

532
00:45:05,522 --> 00:45:07,343
You just, things happen.

533
00:45:07,683 --> 00:45:16,930
If it's a snow emergency, I wouldn't want my clients to come on a day like that and have them obstruct the plowing.

534
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:20,952
Okay.

535
00:45:22,854 --> 00:45:23,114
Chris?

536
00:45:25,015 --> 00:45:27,557
Yeah, Mr. Chair, I just was wondering, do the

537
00:45:32,262 --> 00:45:36,667
parking permits allow people to use it all day.

538
00:45:36,687 --> 00:45:37,509
I can't remember.

539
00:45:37,529 --> 00:45:43,697
There's some limit to how they're

540
00:45:47,724 --> 00:45:48,165
I'm not sure.

541
00:45:48,185 --> 00:45:49,266
Do you want me to just run and get it?

542
00:45:49,306 --> 00:45:50,807
I can read it to you.

543
00:45:51,048 --> 00:45:55,312
No, I'm for your own benefit.

544
00:45:55,732 --> 00:46:02,939
I would just check with the parking office to make sure that you can do that versus what Yvette just said, which is maybe a little.

545
00:46:07,479 --> 00:46:12,061
Medford City Council 12th regular meeting June 24, 2025 is called to order.

546
00:46:12,081 --> 00:46:13,081
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

547
00:46:13,541 --> 00:46:14,862

Present.

554

00:46:22,784 --> 00:46:22,964
Present.

Councilor Sang.

557
00:46:25,285 --> 00:46:25,705
Present.

558
00:46:26,826 --> 00:46:27,606
President Behrs.

559
00:46:27,886 --> 00:46:28,206
Present.

560
00:46:28,246 --> 00:46:29,246
Six present, one absent.

561
00:46:29,266 --> 00:46:30,167
The meeting is called to order.

562
00:46:30,207 --> 00:46:30,567
Please rise.

563
00:46:33,375 --> 00:46:43,483
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

564
00:46:47,006 --> 00:46:52,010
Announcements, accolades, remembrances, reports and records.

565
00:46:52,030 --> 00:46:54,332
25-100 offered by Councillor Scarpelli and President Behrs.

566
00:46:55,428 --> 00:47:04,595
Whereas the Medford City Council has learned with deep sadness of the passing of Richard Caraviello, who passed away June 3rd, 2025, at the age of 93.

567
00:47:05,276 --> 00:47:15,103
And whereas Richard Caraviello was a devoted son of the late Salvatore and Maria Contrada Caraviello, and a beloved husband to the late Angela Moscow Caraviello, and the late Mildred Tarifo.

568
00:47:15,503 --> 00:47:23,510
And whereas Richard honorably served his country in the United States Army during the Korean War, and has continued to serve his community as the longtime proprietor

569
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:43,670
of Salve Sportwear, a business known for quality women's clothing and family values, and where as Richard's father to Richard Carabiello and his wife Carol, a proud grandfather to Richard and his wife Lisa, Lauren and her husband Joey Mangello, and Nicole and her husband Stephen Gaudet, and a cherished great-grandfather to Gianna, Joey, Richie, Nicholas, Juliana, Isabella,

570
00:47:44,270 --> 00:48:13,358
James and Michael, and whereas Richard was a dear brother of the late Fred, Salvatore, Junie, Frank, Smokey, Tina, Clara, and Armand Caraviello, and is lovingly remembered by many nieces and nephews, extended family members, and friends, and whereas Richard Caraviello will be remembered as a man of his humble service and unwavering pride in his Medford roots, now therefore be it resolved that the Medford City Council extends its sincerest condolences to the Caraviello family and expresses its heartfelt appreciation for the life, service, and legacy of Richard Caraviello,

571
00:48:14,075 --> 00:48:24,288
and be it further resolved that this resolution be spread upon the records of the Medford City Council and a suitably engrossed copy be presented to the Carabiello family as a lasting expression of sympathy and gratitude.

572
00:48:24,528 --> 00:48:25,529
Councillor Scarpelli.

573
00:48:27,091 --> 00:48:29,134
Thank you, Councillor Baez.

574
00:48:29,174 --> 00:48:32,678
I appreciate the reading and joining me in this

575
00:48:33,638 --> 00:48:34,658
remembrance.

576
00:48:35,259 --> 00:48:44,302
Mr. Carviello, again, we talk about legacies here in Medford and what families have done to build method to the city that we all love.

577
00:48:44,622 --> 00:48:47,863
And Mr. Carviello was one of those founders.

578
00:48:47,963 --> 00:48:55,425
And you could see that in the man he raised in our former city council, President Richard Carviello.

579
00:48:56,106 --> 00:48:56,446
And I

580
00:48:57,929 --> 00:49:08,437
If you know Richard, if you know Rick, you know that he has, and even as a retired city councilor, how hard he works for the residents of Medford to this day.

581
00:49:09,057 --> 00:49:16,123
And every time we talked, Rick would talk about the work ethic instilled in him by his dad.

582
00:49:16,763 --> 00:49:20,646
And you see that throughout his family.

583
00:49:20,946 --> 00:49:21,207
And, um,

584
00:49:22,925 --> 00:49:33,091
Most importantly, you really see the true dedication of family, love and passion, and really someone that we know that Mr. Carviello fought very hard.

585
00:49:33,291 --> 00:49:43,357
He spent many years in assisted living, and it was very difficult at the end, but he's in a better place today, and we send the Carviello family our condolences.

586
00:49:43,417 --> 00:49:48,981
So thank you for allowing this motion to be put forth, Mr. President.

587
00:49:49,581 --> 00:49:49,961
Thank you.

588
00:49:50,081 --> 00:49:50,782
President Collins.

589
00:49:51,918 --> 00:49:59,243
I just want to thank my colleagues for putting this resolution forward and join with you in extending my deepest and most heartfelt condolences to the entire Carabiello family.

590
00:50:00,765 --> 00:50:02,846
Thank you, Vice President Collins.

591
00:50:05,128 --> 00:50:06,689
I served with Rick for four years.

592
00:50:06,709 --> 00:50:10,892
Would it be possible to go inside your house?

593
00:50:17,937 --> 00:50:21,300
The doorbell, I would come down and answer the doorbell and they could absolutely do that.

594
00:50:23,344 --> 00:50:24,765
So I mean, that happens.

595
00:50:24,825 --> 00:50:25,405
I'm at my house.

596
00:50:25,425 --> 00:50:26,505
Someone rings the doorbell.

597
00:50:26,906 --> 00:50:28,346
I come down to see it.

598
00:50:28,386 --> 00:50:36,970
It's not, I mean, it's kind of a more casual business approach because it is a house.

599
00:50:37,070 --> 00:50:42,193
And someone rings the doorbell.

600
00:50:42,493 --> 00:50:43,253
I go answer it.

601
00:50:43,773 --> 00:50:45,954
You come back and then finish the work.

602
00:50:46,034 --> 00:50:48,395
So I specialize in sports and injury work.

603
00:50:50,550 --> 00:50:53,293
Manny Ramirez, David Ortiz.

604
00:50:53,973 --> 00:51:00,819
So I work with a lot of ultimate frisbee players as a pro ultimate team in Medford.

605
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:08,706
I work with half the team, the coaches, the owners, a lot of top students I work with in town.

606
00:51:09,747 --> 00:51:14,632
So it would just be really convenient to work here.

607
00:51:15,515 --> 00:51:16,657
But yes, absolutely.

608
00:51:16,717 --> 00:51:21,086
If someone had to go to the bathroom and they would come in and ring the bell, I would let them in.

609
00:51:23,270 --> 00:51:24,272
And we have two restrooms.

610
00:51:24,292 --> 00:51:26,055
We have a downstairs one and an upstairs one.

611
00:51:28,743 --> 00:51:32,565
So I think you probably had discussed it before, but I just want to make sure that I got it clear.

612
00:51:32,945 --> 00:51:36,687
So you have to get the approval from zoning first.

613
00:51:37,827 --> 00:51:42,390
That's the very first step before you apply for the other licenses.

614
00:51:45,431 --> 00:51:53,715
I need a business license from the city first and with the application for the solo establishment license from the state.

615
00:51:54,283 --> 00:51:55,484
that's one of the criteria.

616
00:51:55,544 --> 00:52:01,028
So if I don't have the business license, I can't get the solo establishment license.

617
00:52:03,029 --> 00:52:07,673
And is massage therapist, is that licensed too?

618
00:52:08,533 --> 00:52:11,175
I am a licensed massage therapist for over 30 years.

619
00:52:12,616 --> 00:52:13,016
Thank you.

620
00:52:13,457 --> 00:52:16,379
So but the space itself, the rooms,

621
00:52:18,658 --> 00:52:20,919
then need to be licensed.

622
00:52:20,959 --> 00:52:33,206
So the inspector comes in, you need a fire extinguisher, a fire alarm, a sink, bathroom, get the licensing from the state and a business license.

623
00:52:33,247 --> 00:52:35,868
So those are all the things, plus a few other things.

624
00:52:36,889 --> 00:52:37,989
A covered trash can.

625
00:52:38,049 --> 00:52:40,531
I just found that out six months ago.

626
00:52:41,852 --> 00:52:44,693
The inspector came and said, oh, you need a cover in your trash can.

627
00:52:44,713 --> 00:52:47,095
I'm like, okay, no one else has told me that before.

628
00:52:54,762 --> 00:52:59,947
All right, so I'm going to open it for comments from members of the public.

629
00:52:59,987 --> 00:53:04,171
So if you're a member of the public who would like to speak on this matter, you may do so now.

630
00:53:04,191 --> 00:53:08,815
You can raise your hand on Zoom, turn on your camera, and raise your hand.

631
00:53:08,835 --> 00:53:11,237
Or you can email Dennis at google.com.

632
00:53:22,290 --> 00:53:25,793
Not seeing any members of the public that would like to speak.

633
00:53:26,873 --> 00:53:28,194
Motion to close public hearing.

634
00:53:30,296 --> 00:53:30,676
Second.

635
00:53:31,757 --> 00:53:33,578
All right, we're going to take a roll call.

636
00:53:33,618 --> 00:53:33,979
Jim?

637
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:35,800
Aye.

638
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:36,680
Mary?

639
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:37,381
Aye.

640
00:53:38,442 --> 00:53:38,882
Andre?

641
00:53:38,902 --> 00:53:39,542
Aye.

642
00:53:40,303 --> 00:53:40,603
Chris?

643
00:53:41,884 --> 00:53:42,104
Aye.

644
00:53:42,885 --> 00:53:43,105
Beth?

645
00:53:44,286 --> 00:53:44,426
Aye.

646
00:53:45,687 --> 00:53:48,449
All right, we are now deliberating.

647
00:53:49,610 --> 00:53:51,331
And so just to reiterate,

648
00:53:52,457 --> 00:53:55,859
the relevant part of what I said earlier.

649
00:53:55,979 --> 00:54:02,503
So there's a bunch of conditions that need to be met for a home occupation by special permit.

650
00:54:05,245 --> 00:54:13,330
My understanding is that this does meet all of the required conditions as described.

651
00:54:15,312 --> 00:54:15,952
And so

652
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:37,706
In that case, the board may issue a special permit subject condition to restricting the hours of operation, the maximum floor area, off-street parking, and the maximum number of daily customer or other vehicle trips.

653
00:54:41,327 --> 00:54:45,249
So yeah, I think the board should discuss.

654
00:54:46,369 --> 00:54:48,430
We don't have to meet a variance standard or anything.

655
00:54:50,638 --> 00:54:58,583
on the merits, would there be substantial detriment to the public good in granting this license?

656
00:54:58,843 --> 00:55:08,509
And what are the conditions that we would need to impose such detriment?

657
00:55:12,131 --> 00:55:12,451
Mary.

658
00:55:13,552 --> 00:55:16,494
Can we pull up a street view of the property?

659
00:55:16,514 --> 00:55:19,656
Is that something we could do?

660
00:55:21,330 --> 00:55:21,770
I can do that.

661
00:55:21,890 --> 00:55:23,071
Give me a second.

662
00:55:31,015 --> 00:55:33,396
Also, I'm not going to have an external sign.

663
00:55:34,536 --> 00:55:34,777
OK.

664
00:55:35,257 --> 00:55:41,680
Thanks for clarifying.

665
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:43,041
While that's happening, can I just?

666
00:55:43,421 --> 00:55:43,681
Sure.

667
00:55:43,721 --> 00:55:44,261
Go ahead, Andre.

668
00:55:44,321 --> 00:55:47,042
Yeah, I would suggest.

669
00:55:48,729 --> 00:55:54,775
The conditions in terms of hours, we could set maybe like an 8 a.m.

670
00:55:54,835 --> 00:55:55,956
to 7 p.m.

671
00:55:55,976 --> 00:56:01,481
and maximum like 10 appointments per day, two days a week.

672
00:56:01,982 --> 00:56:09,049
That way there's an opportunity to be a little bit flexible, but nothing outside of what the parking permits allow.

673
00:56:13,101 --> 00:56:13,401
OK.

674
00:56:13,922 --> 00:56:16,162
And in terms of this, it is a corner lot.

675
00:56:16,182 --> 00:56:23,624
There's plenty of on-street parking for a couple, like a car or two, in front of their own property.

676
00:56:23,664 --> 00:56:26,645
So I don't have a problem with any of that.

677
00:56:26,665 --> 00:56:33,627
Other thoughts from the board?

678
00:56:39,769 --> 00:56:40,329
Thank you, Dennis.

679
00:56:46,310 --> 00:56:58,274
So I definitely think it's important to include in any special permit some details on hours of operation and so on.

680
00:56:58,354 --> 00:57:05,236
So there's no off-street parking proposed.

681
00:57:05,416 --> 00:57:12,239
So if we were to impose that condition, it would impact the plans as presented.

682
00:57:15,115 --> 00:57:27,339
So the hours of operation, I'm of the opinion we should really speak to the operating hours and the operating days.

683
00:57:27,679 --> 00:57:31,320
Otherwise, it's really hard to enforce.

684
00:57:32,001 --> 00:57:32,941
It's unclear.

685
00:57:32,961 --> 00:57:43,685
How would the city know if it was one hour a day split over six days versus six hours over one day?

686
00:57:47,127 --> 00:57:48,528
But not a requirement.

687
00:57:48,568 --> 00:57:49,908
Just wanted to throw that out there.

688
00:57:50,629 --> 00:57:52,209
I do agree with Andre.

689
00:57:53,050 --> 00:58:04,194
If we're too restrictive with the special permit, it could limit the flexibility for the applicant in a way that's detrimental to the business.

690
00:58:04,274 --> 00:58:10,217
So having some buffer in there also makes sense to me.

691
00:58:12,117 --> 00:58:13,538
Other thoughts from the board?

692
00:58:16,710 --> 00:58:18,091
Chris.

693
00:58:20,552 --> 00:58:27,917
He's before us for a special permit because of the zoning district or because of the use?

694
00:58:28,637 --> 00:58:35,361
So it's because of the accessory use in this zoning district.

695
00:58:35,482 --> 00:58:42,826
So I don't recall the exact zoning district, but in residential districts in general,

696
00:58:45,005 --> 00:58:48,146
Business uses are substantially restricted.

697
00:58:49,187 --> 00:58:53,748
And one of the rare exceptions is for home occupations.

698
00:58:54,509 --> 00:58:57,350
There's some that are allowed by rights, some that require a special permit.

699
00:58:58,130 --> 00:59:08,774
This is an accessory use that does require a special permit for the licensed massage therapy operation.

700
00:59:13,323 --> 00:59:16,844
I looked at the zoning and I didn't see why this was even before us.

701
00:59:16,944 --> 00:59:18,905
So it's 94.3.4.2 is what's triggering it.

702
00:59:18,925 --> 00:59:22,246
Yeah, it seems like that's for employees coming to them.

703
00:59:43,227 --> 01:00:00,578
Yeah, so it's a little convoluted, but it's trying to distinguish what you could do without even talking to us versus what needs to talk to us.

704
01:00:00,738 --> 01:00:07,522
And so the reason why 94.3.4.1, as of right, doesn't apply is it meets six out of the seven criteria.

705
01:00:12,401 --> 01:00:15,402
produces customer or client trips to the location.

706
01:00:17,043 --> 01:00:22,725
So because it produces customer or client trips, it triggers the need for a special permit.

707
01:00:23,845 --> 01:00:24,365
Ah, okay.

708
01:00:24,786 --> 01:00:25,066
Got it.

709
01:00:25,286 --> 01:00:25,746
I saw that.

710
01:00:26,186 --> 01:00:26,466
Thanks.

711
01:00:27,247 --> 01:00:27,467
Sure.

712
01:00:36,110 --> 01:00:41,452
Russell, it sounds like at least some members of the board are considering

713
01:00:42,551 --> 01:00:46,654
Approval subject to some conditions on the operating hours.

714
01:00:46,734 --> 01:01:00,824
So do you have Like a set of operating hours and days that you're definitely comfortable don't think it's gonna cause any issues for you So you said you're planning to do ten to six on Monday.

715
01:01:01,444 --> 01:01:06,148
Yeah possibly Friday, I'm taking Fridays off now, but

716
01:01:07,211 --> 01:01:12,074
potentially Fridays, but I'm just working four days a week now and I work three days downtown.

717
01:01:12,915 --> 01:01:17,978
And just the one day we said would be people outside of the city to make it easier for them.

718
01:01:18,538 --> 01:01:20,720
Plus, it's not a bad commute for me either.

719
01:01:20,820 --> 01:01:22,781
So that's kind of a bonus.

720
01:01:23,722 --> 01:01:25,423
Okay, just a curiosity question.

721
01:01:26,384 --> 01:01:34,489
When you're on site at your other place of business, what are your typical working hours there?

722
01:01:35,851 --> 01:01:40,973
There I'm a little later 1130 to seven, literally just because of the commute.

723
01:01:43,114 --> 01:01:45,435
I like to do like a second work late.

724
01:01:46,355 --> 01:01:56,139
I actually am a part time musician I have a gig tonight in downtown Boston funeral hall so I don't like to work any later.

725
01:01:59,721 --> 01:02:08,787
Thursday, so just something like 9 to 7, 10 to 7 would be plenty of coverage and then Mondays and Fridays would be plenty of day coverage.

726
01:02:09,107 --> 01:02:09,708
Absolutely.

727
01:02:13,670 --> 01:02:15,131
Other questions or thoughts from the board?

728
01:02:22,544 --> 01:02:25,446
I work at a rent space called Joint Ventures.

729
01:02:25,466 --> 01:02:26,827
They have about 10 locations.

730
01:02:27,307 --> 01:02:35,933
I'm at their downtown crossing for Water Street location, three days, end day there just because I want to take the day off.

731
01:02:38,615 --> 01:02:44,398
And like I said, it's just, it would be great to get for people that are coming in from out of town.

732
01:02:45,199 --> 01:02:47,000
And I have a lot of clients that are doing that.

733
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:50,883
Andre, go ahead.

734
01:02:52,912 --> 01:02:59,694
Motion to approve the special permit with the condition of operating hours between 9 a.m.

735
01:03:00,774 --> 01:03:01,775
and 7 p.m.

736
01:03:01,875 --> 01:03:02,895
on Mondays and Fridays.

737
01:03:04,736 --> 01:03:05,576
I'll give it a second.

738
01:03:05,796 --> 01:03:06,416
I'll second.

739
01:03:07,336 --> 01:03:09,857
We're going to take a roll call.

740
01:03:09,937 --> 01:03:10,257
Yvette?

741
01:03:11,458 --> 01:03:11,598
Aye.

742
01:03:12,618 --> 01:03:13,118
Gary?

743
01:03:13,898 --> 01:03:14,018
Aye.

744
01:03:14,939 --> 01:03:15,319
Chris?

745
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:18,380
Aye.

746
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:19,420
Jim?

747
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:20,380
Aye.

748
01:03:21,281 --> 01:03:21,641
Andre?

749
01:03:22,261 --> 01:03:22,341
Aye.

750
01:03:23,068 --> 01:03:25,249
All right, this control permit is approved.

751
01:03:25,309 --> 01:03:28,170
So one step along the way, Russell.

752
01:03:28,230 --> 01:03:28,970
Thank you very much.

753
01:03:28,990 --> 01:03:30,210
I really appreciate your time.

754
01:03:30,571 --> 01:03:32,211
How do I go about getting the license now?

755
01:03:32,251 --> 01:03:33,492
Do I go see Dennis or?

756
01:03:33,512 --> 01:03:34,992
All right.

757
01:03:35,192 --> 01:03:36,012
So yeah, Russ.

758
01:03:36,052 --> 01:03:45,436
So I have to write up the permit, I mean, the decision, and then it gets checked by legal and then it gets signed by the members and then it gets filed in the clerk's office.

759
01:03:46,056 --> 01:03:47,977
At that point, it starts the 20 day clock.

760
01:03:48,537 --> 01:03:48,877
Okay.

761
01:03:49,813 --> 01:03:50,894
Um, from that point.

762
01:03:50,914 --> 01:03:55,157
So I would say probably in the, I haven't done one of these types of decisions before.

763
01:03:55,217 --> 01:03:57,438
So sometimes I can bang them out very quickly.

764
01:03:57,478 --> 01:04:09,706
This one I think might, I might need to talk to legal a little bit more on it, but a month and a half, give or take, you know, the meeting to when you've got your, whatever, whatever gets filed in the clerk's office, I'll let you know.

765
01:04:09,746 --> 01:04:11,467
And that starts the 20 day clock.

766
01:04:11,487 --> 01:04:15,729
And then once 20 days are over, as long as there's no appeal, then you go and you get your permit.

767
01:04:16,230 --> 01:04:16,530
Okay.

768
01:04:16,973 --> 01:04:18,173
I really appreciate your time.

769
01:04:18,233 --> 01:04:19,274
Thank you all for your time.

770
01:04:19,534 --> 01:04:20,874
It's a big help.

771
01:04:20,914 --> 01:04:21,294
Thank you.

772
01:04:21,314 --> 01:04:22,515
All right.

773
01:04:23,355 --> 01:04:24,115
Thank you.

774
01:04:24,495 --> 01:04:24,896
Take care.

775
01:04:27,396 --> 01:04:28,377
All right.

776
01:04:29,017 --> 01:04:30,797
Is that our last case, Dennis?

777
01:04:32,218 --> 01:04:33,958
It is.

778
01:04:33,978 --> 01:04:34,018
OK.

779
01:04:34,038 --> 01:04:36,099
So next we have administrative updates.

780
01:04:36,119 --> 01:04:36,539
Is that right?

781
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:44,902
Administrative updates, I sort of give you the only, hopefully, as I sort of said, we should have

782
01:04:46,157 --> 01:05:15,130
a the full complement members by our next meeting um and i'm trying to think of anything internally anything no nothing nothing major i don't think from our end uh you know just the normal compiling is coming through so um should have i mean may will be i think there's like four well five now with the one continued i think i think that's what our numbers are looking for for uh for may

783
01:05:16,843 --> 01:05:17,763
All right.

784
01:05:17,883 --> 01:05:26,447
And then, Dennis, I know you suggested we have a discussion of potential meeting minute formats today.

785
01:05:26,627 --> 01:05:33,590
And so you sent over two versions of meeting minutes for the board's review.

786
01:05:33,650 --> 01:05:35,211
I have had a chance to look at them.

787
01:05:35,351 --> 01:05:36,472
So yeah.

788
01:05:37,992 --> 01:05:39,413
How do you want to go about this?

789
01:05:39,453 --> 01:05:41,054
Do you want to share some details on it?

790
01:05:41,074 --> 01:05:43,875
I'm just sort of giving my sort of initial thoughts.

791
01:05:45,152 --> 01:05:47,233
part of me kind of likes a little bit of both.

792
01:05:47,653 --> 01:05:59,898
So I was trying to do something actually after I sent, before I sent them off to you, one of my missions was to try to use the program to sort of combine the best of both worlds in these, see if it could do it itself.

793
01:05:59,938 --> 01:06:09,962
And it couldn't, but I do kind of, and looking at the one that's just the summary format, I think that's actually pretty solid in terms of, you know,

794
01:06:10,711 --> 01:06:16,993
The nuts and bolts of the feeling of the meeting, but then the meeting minutes has a good thing of all the participants, the agenda items, things like that.

795
01:06:17,074 --> 01:06:17,294
So.

796
01:06:18,934 --> 01:06:22,316
Um, but I kind of wanted to sort of sound your opinions on that as well.

797
01:06:23,016 --> 01:06:26,297
And I mean, I think it'd be a relatively straightforward thing.

798
01:06:26,337 --> 01:06:27,278
I might have to do some, you know.

799
01:06:27,958 --> 01:06:38,122
Formatting just to try to figure things out, but like, you know, the, the 1st part of the meeting minutes, 1 that sort of list, you know, date, time, participants, agenda items, things like that.

800
01:06:38,182 --> 01:06:38,442
And then.

801
01:06:39,273 --> 01:06:48,923
sort of go into, whereas they have discussion points, then I can just sort of go into the summary part and sort of move those over to there.

802
01:06:50,045 --> 01:07:01,377
So, Dennis, one question I have, so the software you're using to generate what you then modified for errors, does that

803
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:10,466
allow you to supply a prompt or is it basically just here's a video and then I've made some selections and I just spit something out?

804
01:07:11,827 --> 01:07:31,141
Basically you can you can try and sort of tweak it and ask for things and some of them come out okay like you can say I want to focus more on like for the summary like I want you know you can say I want a summary based on you know this and it's it's not great like I sort of found that it's they have like

805
01:07:33,266 --> 01:07:36,328
20 different types of outputs that they have just general ones.

806
01:07:36,969 --> 01:07:40,931
So I went through last week, I went through every single one of them and he sent you the three best.

807
01:07:41,391 --> 01:07:41,672
Okay.

808
01:07:42,472 --> 01:07:44,653
So, and those were the ones that I sent you.

809
01:07:44,714 --> 01:07:55,240
So my curiosity is mostly like, I'll just for the sake of this discussion, call them, um, summary styles.

810
01:07:55,781 --> 01:07:59,283
So could you like, let's say the, based on discussion,

811
01:08:00,547 --> 01:08:16,379
the board decides, hey, we really like format A the most, but we share your assessment that it's really important to list details about the meeting and its attendees and the agenda items.

812
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:28,349
Could you say something like, here's the agenda for the meeting, this video's out, and I really want

813
01:08:29,290 --> 01:08:46,445
Summary in style a but please make sure to list details about the meeting and all the attendees and all the agenda items like the support something like that or I believe so so that's when you know Teresa from our office and myself.

814
01:08:46,485 --> 01:08:52,471
We've been the two who've been kind of test test driving this program sort of you know, and I

815
01:08:53,639 --> 01:08:58,361
I was, unfortunately, I was trying to get in touch with her today, and we were kind of crossing paths.

816
01:08:58,381 --> 01:09:00,762
So I never tried to rush home for something.

817
01:09:01,082 --> 01:09:02,302
So I was kind of out of the office for a bit.

818
01:09:02,583 --> 01:09:08,085
But yeah, I can sort of looking at what the program can do.

819
01:09:08,785 --> 01:09:13,007
It is just trying to be exactly where I have it.

820
01:09:15,868 --> 01:09:21,550
So it's actually I can sort of if you want, I'll just let me just sort of do the screen share.

821
01:09:22,644 --> 01:09:29,208
sort of show you what it sort of looks like, just to give you a better idea.

822
01:09:37,033 --> 01:09:38,113
So basically, this is a recording.

823
01:09:38,153 --> 01:09:41,856
And then first thing it does is, you know, it does like a basic summary and then the transcript.

824
01:09:41,896 --> 01:09:47,159
And then, like here at the templates, I can ask for all of these types of...

825
01:09:50,494 --> 01:09:53,337
And sort of looking at it, I kind of agree with what you're saying.

826
01:09:53,717 --> 01:10:03,806
I think there is a way, I just am not, I may actually know a better way to basically, that's what I was sort of trying to do, was trying to get the best of both, almost the best of both worlds format between the two.

827
01:10:04,387 --> 01:10:16,718
And it should be my understanding of the software is that that's doable to say, like, I want, you gotta be very precise about what you're asking for, but I think I can kind of nail down the language and then get one which is sort of,

828
01:10:17,979 --> 01:10:24,467
As I sort of reading myself the best of both worlds, so okay cool that answers my question looks like Andre has a question

829
01:10:26,693 --> 01:10:29,954
Uh, yeah, I have, I guess, a question and a comment.

830
01:10:30,314 --> 01:10:33,035
So the comment is about the format.

831
01:10:33,355 --> 01:10:44,919
I liked the summary for the discussion narrative, and I liked the meeting minutes for kind of everything else, because that was the agenda.

832
01:10:44,959 --> 01:10:46,839
From what you were saying, Dennis, I agree with you.

833
01:10:46,859 --> 01:10:48,480
I would just take, like, that

834
01:10:48,980 --> 01:10:52,402
summary discussion and inserted the deliberation part.

835
01:10:54,024 --> 01:10:57,226
The question that I have is really a legal one.

836
01:10:57,706 --> 01:11:07,293
So if there is an appeal of any of our decisions or question about like what we talked about, is that summary enough detail?

837
01:11:07,913 --> 01:11:10,694
that we would be able to, that'd be useful to us.

838
01:11:10,994 --> 01:11:15,896
Now I see in here you shared your screen and it has, do we keep those transcripts so we could go back to that?

839
01:11:16,016 --> 01:11:19,197
Or is it only, do we have to rely on the meeting minutes?

840
01:11:19,277 --> 01:11:26,599
Because I didn't think they were, I didn't think either format would be detailed enough to be able to handle a court case.

841
01:11:28,260 --> 01:11:28,800
I'll be honest.

842
01:11:28,980 --> 01:11:37,643
I went and looked at other communities meeting minutes for other zoning boards and most of them are just one pages with basically says here was the meeting.

843
01:11:38,729 --> 01:11:39,889
and approved or denied.

844
01:11:39,909 --> 01:11:43,310
They're very, so I, okay.

845
01:11:43,330 --> 01:11:44,511
I am trying.

846
01:11:44,631 --> 01:11:44,871
Yeah.

847
01:11:44,911 --> 01:11:49,632
So I, I've sort of, and then talking to like other, you know, sort of like it's there.

848
01:11:49,912 --> 01:11:57,794
I mean, you'd be literally some of them, some of them just take the agenda and then just cut and paste, like in literally the decision and, you know, do it that way.

849
01:11:57,834 --> 01:12:00,395
And then it's very, so, um,

850
01:12:01,272 --> 01:12:03,354
I mean, but I have, we have all the recordings on tape.

851
01:12:03,374 --> 01:12:06,417
So if we did want to generate the transcript, we can do it instantly with this.

852
01:12:06,457 --> 01:12:07,858
So what happens in the case?

853
01:12:07,898 --> 01:12:13,003
So we will just for an example, the, uh, the most recent appeal, the one on canal street.

854
01:12:13,924 --> 01:12:17,747
So I basically submitted my meeting minutes to them.

855
01:12:18,067 --> 01:12:22,311
And then I also provided them with the video of the meeting, which we have.

856
01:12:22,331 --> 01:12:25,174
So sort of let them sort of go for it that way, if they want to.

857
01:12:26,658 --> 01:12:27,219
do it that way.

858
01:12:27,259 --> 01:12:37,769
So, you know, it's like when I first started, I used to record all of our meetings on little tiny cassette tapes and same sort of thing, you know, just sort of have them as a secondary record.

859
01:12:38,850 --> 01:12:49,641
But for the meeting minutes themselves, I was pretty stunned when I first saw that, the other ones, because I will say, and this is purely

860
01:12:50,455 --> 01:12:52,977
that meeting minutes are the bane of my existence.

861
01:12:53,337 --> 01:13:00,883
So finding this, which I think will simplify it is, is, I'm pretty, pretty happy with what's been done with these so far.

862
01:13:01,483 --> 01:13:06,467
You know, because I, I don't just staff, I mean, yeah, I staff like a few other boards.

863
01:13:06,547 --> 01:13:09,589
So it's getting something like this is, is basically

864
01:13:10,402 --> 01:13:14,571
making kind of make, you know, I mean, basically, I'm, you know, constantly working on these are trying to.

865
01:13:14,591 --> 01:13:14,671
Yeah.

866
01:13:15,513 --> 01:13:16,154
Okay, I'm good.

867
01:13:16,214 --> 01:13:16,675
Go for it.

868
01:13:17,397 --> 01:13:18,159
Yeah.

869
01:13:18,579 --> 01:13:21,606
Andre, just to add my understanding, Simon,

870
01:13:22,053 --> 01:13:24,155
consulted with legal yet.

871
01:13:24,275 --> 01:13:40,089
But so in this hypothetical scenario where there's inadequate written documentation and someone sues Discovery, they can basically request the necessary information, which maybe someone would have to testify to.

872
01:13:41,002 --> 01:13:51,771
In Medford's case with the videos, the video basically does capture everything of relevance in the meeting itself so that it kind of guards against that.

873
01:13:52,371 --> 01:13:58,697
I think that probably the biggest risk in using AI summaries for meeting minutes is in

874
01:14:03,146 --> 01:14:05,607
The second biggest risk would be egregious omissions.

875
01:14:06,307 --> 01:14:09,408
And the biggest risk would be outright falsehoods.

876
01:14:09,448 --> 01:14:11,809
It fabricates the reality.

877
01:14:11,829 --> 01:14:18,352
And so as a board, we follow a process where we have to approve the meeting minutes.

878
01:14:18,372 --> 01:14:21,873
So basically, we would need a process where it's like, here's the format.

879
01:14:23,329 --> 01:14:31,614
Someone at the city feeds in the inputs, generates this, has to review every word, just sanity check that there's nothing glaring.

880
01:14:31,974 --> 01:14:35,256
Then we as a board read it, check for errors.

881
01:14:35,376 --> 01:14:41,200
And then in voting to approve, we're basically saying, hey, the meeting minutes seem accurate.

882
01:14:41,260 --> 01:14:44,082
So that's the process we need to follow.

883
01:14:44,982 --> 01:14:49,685
I could get an opinion if it's essential to anybody.

884
01:14:52,687 --> 01:14:52,787
OK.

885
01:14:53,623 --> 01:15:20,616
uh... what they are interested in sort of much you can you all can't do this but i'd probably have like a notebook in front of you remember basically writing jotting things down so i'd also use that as well as sort of like a secondary i mean it's it's basically a lot of it's like you know just who did what we were in who spoke of things like that so that also sort of helps and then on a paper that there is any quite if i see something like i'm not sure if that's right i just watched the video mentor together from there but

886
01:15:21,612 --> 01:15:22,972
I haven't really noticed anything like that.

887
01:15:23,472 --> 01:15:23,692
Okay.

888
01:15:24,473 --> 01:15:24,753
Yeah.

889
01:15:25,533 --> 01:15:29,753
My suggestion, Dennis, we can take, um, some of the discussion offline.

890
01:15:29,793 --> 01:15:34,834
Like we don't have to discuss this all publicly, but I tend to agree with spoken.

891
01:15:36,355 --> 01:15:41,975
Finding some hybrid way to kind of get the best of both of those examples, um, makes the most sense.

892
01:15:42,075 --> 01:15:44,956
So maybe we can give that a try and take most of this.

893
01:15:46,336 --> 01:15:50,937
Um, I do want to approve a version of the meeting minutes today.

894
01:15:52,744 --> 01:15:54,484
just so that we have one officially.

895
01:15:54,564 --> 01:16:10,672
And so I'm of the opinion that the second one, the one that has the details about the attendees and who spoke, even though it would be better augmented with both, that's the one that is closer to a proper meeting minutes.

896
01:16:10,752 --> 01:16:12,993
The first one's missing some key details.

897
01:16:13,033 --> 01:16:15,515
So I would recommend

898
01:16:16,622 --> 01:16:25,131
Yeah, if the board is willing that we vote on the second set of meetings, the one that has the all the attendees and the agenda and such.

899
01:16:28,955 --> 01:16:29,856
Yeah, I'm fine with that.

900
01:16:30,296 --> 01:16:37,964
Um, I think I was wondering, Dennis, if there's another like a, if you get versions that you're at least.

901
01:16:39,707 --> 01:16:41,028
you know, it works somewhat.

902
01:16:41,828 --> 01:16:49,111
Is there a way that you can take the two versions and then somehow put them into a another program?

903
01:16:49,131 --> 01:16:50,331
That's what I'm sort of hopeful.

904
01:16:51,592 --> 01:16:52,452
That's sort of the idea.

905
01:16:52,472 --> 01:16:54,953
And that's what I kind of wanted to talk with Teresa with this.

906
01:16:55,373 --> 01:16:59,255
I know she's been she's used them for the Preservation Committee.

907
01:16:59,295 --> 01:17:04,417
So I, I think that and I think if there's an option within this program to do so I just

908
01:17:05,492 --> 01:17:14,977
So I, but I think there, I seem to recall when I was working last week when I was generating these, there was something where I could sort of create my own sort of hybrid for, for output.

909
01:17:15,597 --> 01:17:16,597
And so I think that's there.

910
01:17:16,638 --> 01:17:20,139
It's just, I think it's going to be a matter of like just getting the tweaking language just right.

911
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:24,701
So, and really being specific about what it's looking for, but I think it's doable.

912
01:17:25,682 --> 01:17:25,862
Yeah.

913
01:17:26,122 --> 01:17:33,586
I mean, I would, I'd be also curious to know about the legal, you know, um,

914
01:17:34,753 --> 01:17:45,759
requirements of what are you know, if we put together something and then give it to legal to look at and say, is that sufficient?

915
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:52,463
So yeah, so here's my recommendation.

916
01:17:53,543 --> 01:17:56,665
Dennis, let's you and I started with legal just

917
01:17:57,720 --> 01:18:03,944
generally talking about use of AI in generating meeting minutes and procedure and potential.

918
01:18:04,465 --> 01:18:07,687
And we can use these meeting minutes as an example.

919
01:18:09,927 --> 01:18:12,668
Like I said, we have the guardrail for any given set.

920
01:18:12,768 --> 01:18:15,210
Read them, verify their accuracy, and approve them.

921
01:18:15,330 --> 01:18:18,291
So I'm comfortable approving a set today.

922
01:18:18,311 --> 01:18:25,295
And then I can report back to the board, assuming we have a response, the guidance.

923
01:18:25,555 --> 01:18:29,597
If needed, we could do an executive session if that would be necessary.

924
01:18:30,637 --> 01:18:31,738
Does that sound good?

925
01:18:31,818 --> 01:18:33,359
Dennis, could you start that thread with them?

926
01:18:34,676 --> 01:18:35,256
Yeah, I'll do that.

927
01:18:35,276 --> 01:18:37,357
I'll talk to KB Law tomorrow.

928
01:18:38,037 --> 01:18:38,238
OK.

929
01:18:38,658 --> 01:18:41,419
And so, yeah, I'd like to participate in that discussion.

930
01:18:41,439 --> 01:18:42,919
Yeah, sure.

931
01:18:43,220 --> 01:18:43,420
Cool.

932
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:44,400
OK, great.

933
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:45,841
I'll include you in the email too, Rami.

934
01:18:45,881 --> 01:18:59,006
All right, so chair awaits a motion to approve the second set of meeting minutes titled, they have different titles.

935
01:19:00,227 --> 01:19:03,028
Oh, yeah, the ZBA minutes with a date

936
01:19:03,657 --> 01:19:04,737
meeting minutes format.

937
01:19:06,898 --> 01:19:09,239
For March 27.

938
01:19:09,619 --> 01:19:11,100
Yeah, for March 27.

939
01:19:11,180 --> 01:19:11,660
Motion.

940
01:19:13,481 --> 01:19:15,101
Do I have a second?

941
01:19:15,422 --> 01:19:15,842
Seconded.

942
01:19:15,862 --> 01:19:18,203
All right, I'm going to take a roll call.

943
01:19:18,223 --> 01:19:18,583
Yvette?

944
01:19:19,643 --> 01:19:19,763
Aye.

945
01:19:20,243 --> 01:19:20,584
Chris?

946
01:19:21,204 --> 01:19:21,344
Aye.

947
01:19:21,824 --> 01:19:22,304
Mary?

948
01:19:22,324 --> 01:19:23,065
Aye.

949
01:19:23,465 --> 01:19:23,845
Jim?

950
01:19:24,345 --> 01:19:24,625
Aye.

951
01:19:25,105 --> 01:19:25,586
Andre?

952
01:19:25,606 --> 01:19:26,166
Aye.

953
01:19:26,626 --> 01:19:26,926
Mike?

954
01:19:27,826 --> 01:19:27,946
Aye.

955
01:19:28,006 --> 01:19:29,687
The meeting minutes are approved.

956
01:19:30,527 --> 01:19:31,928
Woohoo, that feels good.

957
01:19:32,878 --> 01:19:33,538
Let's do it again.

958
01:19:35,039 --> 01:19:35,339
Yeah.

959
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:40,302
And then it's just for logistics.

960
01:19:40,402 --> 01:19:43,403
I won't be here next month on the 20th.

961
01:19:43,443 --> 01:19:43,744
Thanks.

962
01:19:44,624 --> 01:19:45,705
I appreciate that.

963
01:19:45,825 --> 01:19:46,245
That's good.

964
01:19:47,065 --> 01:19:47,485
Good to know.

965
01:19:47,546 --> 01:19:47,846
Thank you.

966
01:19:49,086 --> 01:19:49,286
All right.

967
01:19:49,326 --> 01:19:51,688
I think we're at the end of our agenda.

968
01:19:51,788 --> 01:19:55,550
So chair awaits a motion to turn motion.

969
01:19:56,590 --> 01:19:56,850
Second.

970
01:19:56,870 --> 01:19:57,150
All right.

971
01:19:57,831 --> 01:19:58,971
We're going to take a roll call.

972
01:19:59,111 --> 01:19:59,592
Andre.

973
01:19:59,612 --> 01:20:01,293
Hi, Jim.

974
01:20:01,813 --> 01:20:01,973
Hi.

975
01:20:02,409 --> 01:20:02,789
Mary.

976
01:20:02,809 --> 01:20:03,470
Aye.

977
01:20:03,870 --> 01:20:04,170
Chris.

978
01:20:05,111 --> 01:20:05,231
Aye.

979
01:20:05,571 --> 01:20:05,891
Yvette.

980
01:20:06,672 --> 01:20:06,812
Aye.

981
01:20:07,312 --> 01:20:07,532
Mike.

982
01:20:08,052 --> 01:20:08,193
Aye.

983
01:20:08,593 --> 01:20:09,433
We are now adjourned.

984
01:20:10,894 --> 01:20:11,915
Thank you all very much.

985
01:20:13,176 --> 01:20:14,436
Welcome Zoning Board of Appeals.

986
01:20:14,476 --> 01:20:17,198
We're going to take a quick roll call and then we'll get started.

987
01:20:18,579 --> 01:20:19,239
Jim Tirani.

988
01:20:19,259 --> 01:20:20,360
Present.

989
01:20:21,301 --> 01:20:21,981
Mary Lee.

990
01:20:22,541 --> 01:20:22,962
Present.

991
01:20:24,002 --> 01:20:24,723
Andre LaRue.

992
01:20:25,423 --> 01:20:25,783
Present.

993
01:20:27,364 --> 01:20:31,407
I don't believe we have Christy Yvette yet.

994
01:20:32,660 --> 01:20:36,822
Mike Caldera and Yvette Velez will not be joining.

995
01:20:37,382 --> 01:20:38,382
Mike Caldera present.

996
01:20:38,542 --> 01:20:40,143
So we've got quorum.

997
01:20:40,203 --> 01:20:40,903
We have four.

998
01:20:41,824 --> 01:20:45,645
If Chris joins, we'll be up to five, which is our full voting capacity.

999
01:20:45,745 --> 01:20:47,746
So we'll go ahead and get started.

1000
01:20:48,306 --> 01:20:49,427
Dennis, can you please kick us off?

1001
01:20:50,047 --> 01:20:50,267
Yeah.

1002
01:20:50,427 --> 01:20:54,709
So we're actually going to jump a little bit around on the order.

1003
01:20:54,929 --> 01:20:58,210
And we're just going to 77 Shepard Road.

1004
01:20:58,270 --> 01:20:59,931
The applicants are going to be asking for continuance.

1005
01:21:00,921 --> 01:21:02,462
So then it's just double checking.

1006
01:21:02,482 --> 01:21:07,305
Do we have to do the intro blurb about the virtual meeting anymore?

1007
01:21:07,665 --> 01:21:08,926
No, no, we received word.

1008
01:21:08,946 --> 01:21:11,107
We don't have to state that anymore.

1009
01:21:12,228 --> 01:21:12,908
Okay, awesome.

1010
01:21:12,988 --> 01:21:16,310
So let's take Shepard Road out of order then.

1011
01:21:17,131 --> 01:21:18,232
Can you read that one please?

1012
01:21:18,552 --> 01:21:18,672
Yeah.

1013
01:21:22,439 --> 01:21:24,240
77 Shepard Road case number 8-2025-08.

1014
01:21:24,340 --> 01:21:45,074
Applicant and owner Christian and Joseph Paradiso to maintain a hot tub classified as a swimming pool at 77 Shepard Road in a single family one zoning district allowed use with insufficient setback from the rear lot line for the City of Medford zoning ordinance chapter 94-4.3.2 for dimensional requirements for accessory structures location of accessory structure.

1015
01:21:46,595 --> 01:21:53,817
All right, and so Dennis, you said you got a request in writing from the applicant to- It was a verbal request, but they're on the call right now.

1016
01:21:54,097 --> 01:21:55,077
Oh, verbal request.

1017
01:21:55,357 --> 01:21:55,557
Okay.

1018
01:21:56,757 --> 01:22:01,198
Applicant, would you like to say anything before the board votes on the requested continuance?

1019
01:22:02,258 --> 01:22:02,538
Yes.

1020
01:22:02,939 --> 01:22:03,719
Thank you, Mr. Chair.

1021
01:22:04,939 --> 01:22:09,600
Our neighbor evidently has retained counsel, and we just received his lawyer's letter.

1022
01:22:10,625 --> 01:22:16,469
this afternoon only a handful of hours with no time at all to review it so we can properly address what's there and review it.

1023
01:22:18,591 --> 01:22:20,032
All right, thank you.

1024
01:22:20,532 --> 01:22:22,534
So yeah, the board hasn't heard any evidence.

1025
01:22:22,554 --> 01:22:26,377
Customarily, we'll grant continuances when requested.

1026
01:22:26,517 --> 01:22:32,101
So chair awaits a motion to continue this matter to our next regular meeting.

1027
01:22:32,121 --> 01:22:32,381
Thank you.

1028
01:22:35,103 --> 01:22:35,443
Motion.

1029
01:22:35,463 --> 01:22:37,164
Do I have a second?

1030
01:22:37,525 --> 01:22:37,865
Second.

1031
01:22:38,633 --> 01:22:40,534
All right, we're going to take a roll call vote.

1032
01:22:40,854 --> 01:22:41,175
Jim?

1033
01:22:41,855 --> 01:22:42,035
Aye.

1034
01:22:42,515 --> 01:22:42,916
Mary?

1035
01:22:42,936 --> 01:22:43,756
Aye.

1036
01:22:44,797 --> 01:22:45,197
Andre?

1037
01:22:45,217 --> 01:22:45,877
Aye.

1038
01:22:46,858 --> 01:22:47,318
Chris?

1039
01:22:48,759 --> 01:22:48,899
Aye.

1040
01:22:49,980 --> 01:22:50,240
Mike?

1041
01:22:50,540 --> 01:22:50,640
Aye.

1042
01:22:50,980 --> 01:22:58,205
This matter is continued to our next regular meeting, which Dennis, um, April 24th, April 24th.

1043
01:22:58,305 --> 01:22:58,865
All right.

1044
01:22:59,305 --> 01:22:59,786
Thanks folks.

1045
01:23:00,106 --> 01:23:03,388
With the exact same information that we use for the meeting tonight.

1046
01:23:03,408 --> 01:23:04,228
Thank you.

1047
01:23:09,593 --> 01:23:10,493
All right, what's next?

1048
01:23:11,654 --> 01:23:15,695
640 Boston Avenue, case number A-2025-06.

1049
01:23:16,335 --> 01:23:27,618
Applicant and owner Sphere Residential to convert a retail space 640 Boston Avenue into a one-bedroom apartment requiring an amendment to a condition of a variance granted by the Medford Zoning Board, case number A-2015-17.

1050
01:23:27,738 --> 01:23:31,439
All right, thank you.

1051
01:23:31,459 --> 01:23:33,120
Do we have a representative for the applicant?

1052
01:23:34,109 --> 01:23:35,049
Yes, good evening.

1053
01:23:35,089 --> 01:23:36,530
This is attorney Ann Vigarito.

1054
01:23:36,550 --> 01:23:38,530
I am the attorney for the applicant.

1055
01:23:38,750 --> 01:23:49,554
And as Dennis stated, we're here to request an amendment to a condition of a variance that was granted by the Senate Board back in 2015.

1056
01:23:51,334 --> 01:23:55,215
I have a brief introduction and I'll introduce my team.

1057
01:23:55,235 --> 01:23:58,997
I don't anticipate this taking very long.

1058
01:23:59,097 --> 01:24:02,998
So, you know, and then we'd hand it off to the board for questions and so forth.

1059
01:24:04,948 --> 01:24:12,232
So once again, my team, Eric Wyatt from Amana Emma Architects, he's our architect this evening.

1060
01:24:12,252 --> 01:24:19,416
Paul Spivak, he is the building property manager for Sphere, so for this particular building at 640 Boston Avenue.

1061
01:24:19,776 --> 01:24:21,037
He will have a few remarks.

1062
01:24:21,377 --> 01:24:27,280
Just a brief background, 640 Boston Avenue, I'm assuming you may or may not be familiar with the building.

1063
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:33,465
But it's 42 residential units and then the one commercial space that we'll hear about this evening.

1064
01:24:34,346 --> 01:24:45,314
It is right next to an MBTA station, right on the edge of Ball Square, Somerville, so it's a very vibrant area.

1065
01:24:47,516 --> 01:24:50,057
They received their certificate of occupancy back in 2017.

1066
01:24:50,698 --> 01:24:54,359
And at that time, they did not get a commercial tenant.

1067
01:24:54,399 --> 01:24:57,561
They finally got a commercial tenant in early 2020.

1068
01:24:57,761 --> 01:25:03,183
It was a convenience store, last about eight months.

1069
01:25:03,503 --> 01:25:09,446
Some of it may have been COVID, but there's also a convenience store around the corner on Broadway in Somerville.

1070
01:25:11,367 --> 01:25:16,129
And since that time, they've not had another viable resident of commercial tenant for the site.

1071
01:25:16,829 --> 01:25:20,673
There's a huge, you know, for lease sign in the window.

1072
01:25:20,693 --> 01:25:25,478
I mean, they've advertised really to no avail.

1073
01:25:27,937 --> 01:25:36,000
You know, we do have a housing shortage and, you know, at this juncture, it would make a lot of sense to make this a residential unit.

1074
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:38,781
You know, it would be a first floor unit.

1075
01:25:39,221 --> 01:25:42,802
A lot of people look for that type of spacing.

1076
01:25:42,822 --> 01:25:44,522
You know, they like to be on a first level.

1077
01:25:44,562 --> 01:25:46,243
They don't want to get on an elevator.

1078
01:25:46,263 --> 01:25:52,525
It's just, you know, they've had inquiries that people would, you know, wonder, would it be residential?

1079
01:25:54,306 --> 01:25:57,229
I did submit some letters of support from tenants in the building.

1080
01:25:57,709 --> 01:26:10,921
Also, some of the commercial property owners sent in letters, Soundbites, Ball Square Cafe, the owner of the Lindells building,

1081
01:26:12,081 --> 01:26:14,602
You know, they would like to see more residential units.

1082
01:26:14,682 --> 01:26:17,904
It just adds to the vibrancy of the area.

1083
01:26:18,544 --> 01:26:25,947
So at this time, you know, this would be a small one-bedroom unit.

1084
01:26:25,987 --> 01:26:28,908
It would be a 700-square-foot one-bedroom.

1085
01:26:30,489 --> 01:26:33,430
As a commercial space, it did have two parking spaces.

1086
01:26:35,491 --> 01:26:42,938
It's a one bedroom and our anticipation is it would only need one parking space so they would have an extra parking space on the site.

1087
01:26:42,958 --> 01:26:53,627
Tenants but you know a lot of times concerns are you're going to take away you know on street parking off street you know on street parking and so forth so there will be none you know happening.

1088
01:26:55,107 --> 01:27:00,209
It really should be a good positive asset to the neighborhood.

1089
01:27:00,710 --> 01:27:03,731
But I'm going to pass off to Paul Spivak.

1090
01:27:03,751 --> 01:27:04,891
He's the property manager.

1091
01:27:05,371 --> 01:27:15,515
And then Eric will go through a few slides of the building and what the actual, you know, you will look like as it will be designed as a residential unit.

1092
01:27:16,035 --> 01:27:20,337
I will mute myself and Paul, if you could unmute and give your remarks.

1093
01:27:20,417 --> 01:27:20,757
Thank you.

1094
01:27:22,027 --> 01:27:22,627
Thank you, Anne.

1095
01:27:23,468 --> 01:27:27,690
As Anne said, I've been the property manager since the building opened in 2017.

1096
01:27:27,830 --> 01:27:32,852
You know, it's a great, great building, great tenants.

1097
01:27:32,872 --> 01:27:36,073
You know, we have a very diverse group of tenants.

1098
01:27:36,654 --> 01:27:41,516
A lot of them are graduate, undergrads, graduate students.

1099
01:27:41,576 --> 01:27:48,719
We have some professionals, some retirees, so a really, really nice mix of and diverse group of residents.

1100
01:27:49,899 --> 01:27:52,380
A lot of them stopped me quite a bit.

1101
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:53,761
What's going on with that space?

1102
01:27:53,781 --> 01:27:58,683
Why can't you guys seem to get a retail space in there?

1103
01:27:59,484 --> 01:28:05,607
They said, look, if you can't get a retail space, they thought it would be great to have a one-bedroom apartment there.

1104
01:28:06,747 --> 01:28:07,788
I have to agree with them there.

1105
01:28:08,648 --> 01:28:12,610
Had the original owners known what a struggle it's been to get,

1106
01:28:14,092 --> 01:28:16,314
a retail tenant in there.

1107
01:28:16,334 --> 01:28:21,317
I'm sure they would have loved to have, you know, taken this with a one bedroom apartment as well.

1108
01:28:22,257 --> 01:28:25,939
I've seen the struggle from when we first opened.

1109
01:28:25,999 --> 01:28:29,802
It took us, you know, a couple years just to find the convenience store.

1110
01:28:29,822 --> 01:28:35,085
And, you know, their thoughts were they're going to have a lot of, excuse me,

1111
01:28:35,868 --> 01:28:39,269
You know, foot traffic coming off of the new ball square station.

1112
01:28:39,289 --> 01:28:49,512
And unfortunately, you know, most of that foot traffic seems to walk over to the down Broadway and then the foot traffic never really transpired by sphere.

1113
01:28:49,532 --> 01:28:54,274
You know, and that plus due to covid, they just, you know, they just went out of business.

1114
01:28:55,112 --> 01:28:58,715
And ever since then, we've been looking for somebody to no avail.

1115
01:28:59,176 --> 01:29:08,904
And again, it's just kind of a sore spot to have such a, what we built ourselves as a luxury building, to have a vacant space in there.

1116
01:29:08,924 --> 01:29:20,434
And I think it'd be just a great addition to have a beautiful one-bedroom apartment there, bring more business to the area, and just an all-around great opportunity for the community.

1117
01:29:24,262 --> 01:29:27,864
I can jump in here and just have a handful of slides.

1118
01:29:27,905 --> 01:29:29,946
Again, my name is Eric Lyons.

1119
01:29:30,186 --> 01:29:34,209
I am a design principal of architects in Boston.

1120
01:29:34,229 --> 01:29:36,971
I assume everybody can see my screen okay.

1121
01:29:37,651 --> 01:29:45,216
Much of this has already been said, but just to recap, again, the building was permitted and constructed back in 2016-17.

1122
01:29:47,838 --> 01:29:51,780
It's a five-story building with 42 rental apartments.

1123
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:55,642
Primarily the apartments are on levels 2, 3, 4, and 5.

1124
01:29:56,783 --> 01:30:05,908
The ground floor is lobby space and amenity space and then you can see here in this dashed yellow line that corner which was

1125
01:30:06,948 --> 01:30:14,674
plan to be an active use retail space which is really struggled and is essentially a kind of dark corner of the building.

1126
01:30:15,654 --> 01:30:23,000
It's about 700 square feet in size and as Anne mentioned there's 44 parking spaces on site.

1127
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:26,863
There's a curb cut down at the far end of the site and then one at the kind of

1128
01:30:27,283 --> 01:30:33,845
foreground here in this image and all the parking is at grade at the rear of the site on stilts on the back side.

1129
01:30:33,865 --> 01:30:38,267
So some of the cars actually tuck underneath the building.

1130
01:30:39,587 --> 01:30:47,510
From an urban design part to see why this space has kind of suffered and really failed as a retail location.

1131
01:30:47,750 --> 01:30:51,732
This is the building here located or highlighted in this blue line.

1132
01:30:52,712 --> 01:31:01,836
And, you know, when you look at the character of the street and the adjacent parallel streets, they really are residential-centric.

1133
01:31:01,956 --> 01:31:11,461
And to assume that people are going to walk up Boston Ave from Broadway to a small retail space is kind of asking a lot of people.

1134
01:31:11,901 --> 01:31:17,003
This is the primary retail thoroughfare, obviously, connecting across to the T-Stop.

1135
01:31:17,283 --> 01:31:18,704
And really, this is where the

1136
01:31:19,364 --> 01:31:28,248
you know, the main activity occurs and likely should have occurred and probably didn't make sense to propose that as retail beginning of the project.

1137
01:31:28,668 --> 01:31:33,070
I was not the architect for the record of this conversion proposal.

1138
01:31:34,411 --> 01:31:36,892
So this is what this site looks like today.

1139
01:31:36,972 --> 01:31:39,513
As Anne mentioned, there's kind of a big banner in the

1140
01:31:40,813 --> 01:31:57,580
Storefront looking for tenants and as Paul mentioned, there really has been no activity on the leasing front and it's really a shame because this corner of the building could be much more active, have eyes on the street and kind of provide some good to the public realm.

1141
01:32:01,129 --> 01:32:03,829
This is a picture of what the inside looks like.

1142
01:32:03,869 --> 01:32:11,051
There's still some of the old countertop and shelving where your snicker bars and candy would have been displayed from the store.

1143
01:32:11,071 --> 01:32:14,351
It has great visibility out to the street.

1144
01:32:14,991 --> 01:32:20,292
The bottom panes of the glass are kind of frosted in the storefront from this level.

1145
01:32:20,392 --> 01:32:21,032
It's clear.

1146
01:32:21,873 --> 01:32:25,973
We don't propose using the existing double doors as a main entry.

1147
01:32:26,033 --> 01:32:29,394
We're going to use the primary entry lobby

1148
01:32:30,854 --> 01:32:33,317
as the main circulation to access this unit.

1149
01:32:33,337 --> 01:32:35,319
I can show you that in a second in the plan.

1150
01:32:37,261 --> 01:32:47,813
This is a site plan overview that again shows that surface parking at the side and rear of the site, curb cut here and then one just off the page on the corner.

1151
01:32:48,554 --> 01:32:54,198
This blue here is that existing retail proposed one bedroom, one bath apartment.

1152
01:32:54,778 --> 01:32:57,280
And this is the current front door to the building.

1153
01:32:57,360 --> 01:32:58,700
This is the entrance lobby.

1154
01:32:59,421 --> 01:33:01,082
There's a small conference room.

1155
01:33:01,102 --> 01:33:05,105
There's some amenity space on the ground floor, fitness room.

1156
01:33:06,786 --> 01:33:12,010
And then the backside of the building is primarily back house with bicycle storage.

1157
01:33:12,971 --> 01:33:20,177
And as Anne mentioned, from a zoning perspective, there really is a zero proposed change to the parking.

1158
01:33:20,778 --> 01:33:26,542
The current zoning requires 1 space per 350 square feet of retail, which would.

1159
01:33:27,523 --> 01:33:39,754
required two spaces at 700 square feet and at two spaces per unit for a one bedroom unit that would also require two spaces so no change in the parking demand on the site.

1160
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:57,009
And this is the proposed ground floor, as I mentioned, folks will use the hallway connected to from the main entrance lobby, they can pick up their mail and packages, make their way down the hallway into the entry space here.

1161
01:33:57,990 --> 01:34:09,259
Across the Boston Ave frontage is primarily the kitchen, living, dining of the apartment, and then tucked around the corner is the bedroom with the bathroom located in the center.

1162
01:34:09,579 --> 01:34:20,848
This is the fitness area to the side, so we've located some even the run of kitchen and kitchen cabinets along this edge just to provide a little bit of additional sound mitigation between the two spaces.

1163
01:34:21,868 --> 01:34:28,769
And I think that's about it, so I'll pass it back to Anne for any closing remarks, and I'll be happy to answer any questions.

1164
01:34:31,750 --> 01:34:32,570
Thank you once again.

1165
01:34:32,610 --> 01:34:33,190
This is Anne.

1166
01:34:34,410 --> 01:34:50,033
You know, we're not asking to construct a new building, so I don't want to waste precious time at the boards, but an additional residential unit would be an asset to the neighborhood, especially this, you know, area

1167
01:34:51,194 --> 01:34:58,959
Looking at the empty storefront with the four lease sign, it's a nuisance, it's unattractive.

1168
01:35:00,300 --> 01:35:09,006
People who live in the building, they'd like to see a residential unit there and quite a bit of neighborhood support for this conversion.

1169
01:35:09,186 --> 01:35:13,449
I would respectfully request that the board would vote in favor of this amendment.

1170
01:35:14,811 --> 01:35:22,540
But we're here, you know, any questions you have, please feel free at this time, whatever we can answer, you know, we will thank you so much for your time.

1171
01:35:25,224 --> 01:35:25,684
Thank you.

1172
01:35:26,706 --> 01:35:30,871
I'm actually going to start I just want to lead with a technical question to make sure the board.

1173
01:35:31,680 --> 01:35:35,441
is understanding and considering the right criteria here.

1174
01:35:35,481 --> 01:35:44,164
So the application is to amend that was from back in 2015.

1175
01:35:45,504 --> 01:35:54,307
And so I just want to make sure what the specific portion of the variance is that needs amending.

1176
01:35:54,667 --> 01:35:55,947
Was it a use variance?

1177
01:35:56,167 --> 01:35:59,088
Like, does it need to amend the use portion?

1178
01:36:02,122 --> 01:36:11,789
I know it references that the petition already had the mail space, but I'm not seeing any specific language in the variance pertaining to that.

1179
01:36:11,909 --> 01:36:13,950
So could you just clarify where the...

1180
01:36:16,980 --> 01:36:23,582
I believe it was for the condition that the ground level would be retail, or I'm sorry, commercial space.

1181
01:36:23,622 --> 01:36:24,782
Sorry about that, the retail.

1182
01:36:24,802 --> 01:36:38,485
But so it's because I believe when it is worded correctly in the advertisement that's in the meeting agenda, it's an amendment to the condition of the variant.

1183
01:36:38,525 --> 01:36:43,566
So one of the conditions was that there would be a commercial space on the ground level.

1184
01:36:43,586 --> 01:36:45,387
Okay.

1185
01:36:46,039 --> 01:36:49,260
Yeah, so there's language in the variance itself.

1186
01:36:50,620 --> 01:37:06,004
It says, as required by the site plan review process, a number of City of Medford department heads have submitted letters to the Zoning Board of Appeals recommending and in some instances requiring compliance with certain conditions to be incorporated as part of any approvals that may be granted by the ZBA.

1187
01:37:06,024 --> 01:37:12,026
Then it says rather than repeating here each and every recommendation requirement,

1188
01:37:12,945 --> 01:37:17,009
We're going to require all of them, with one exception.

1189
01:37:17,029 --> 01:37:24,095
There were some recommendations from the Historical Commission that the board diverged from.

1190
01:37:24,195 --> 01:37:30,921
So was that required by the CD board in their recommendation or some other?

1191
01:37:31,462 --> 01:37:36,266
No, it was required by the Zoning Board of Appeals in their decision.

1192
01:37:36,908 --> 01:37:50,480
My point is the decision, and sorry, I don't want to drag it out, but the decision basically says we impose the conditions as the zoning board that the various departments and boards recommended.

1193
01:37:51,141 --> 01:37:56,286
But it doesn't say which recommendation that came from.

1194
01:37:56,386 --> 01:38:00,670
So I'm just trying to make sure we understand where it's required.

1195
01:38:01,254 --> 01:38:01,474
Right.

1196
01:38:01,694 --> 01:38:10,057
I, you know, I have the original decision and, you know, rebuilding 42 residential units.

1197
01:38:17,519 --> 01:38:21,960
There was a slew of yes, requirements, but.

1198
01:38:22,879 --> 01:38:26,062
Unfortunately, I was not the attorney at all.

1199
01:38:27,083 --> 01:38:31,007
And when you are the original attorney, it's amazing the things that you'll remember.

1200
01:38:31,427 --> 01:38:43,518
But I believe because it was to be a mixed-use building, the logical is you put commercial on the ground level, not on the second or third floor.

1201
01:38:43,538 --> 01:38:45,540
And I read through it.

1202
01:38:50,903 --> 01:38:51,725
I don't want to belabor it.

1203
01:38:51,765 --> 01:38:53,467
So here's what I'll recommend.

1204
01:38:53,587 --> 01:38:54,288
So clearly the.

1205
01:38:54,368 --> 01:39:05,202
The variance was granted references the plans, which did have the retail and it references conditions recommended by various boards.

1206
01:39:06,148 --> 01:39:21,911
We're not anyway as a board voting on the amendment today, so we'll just kind of take as a fact for consideration that this indirect reference impose some condition that required the retail space and the board will be voting on whether to

1207
01:39:22,591 --> 01:39:30,975
amend the decision to remove that condition, and we can figure out later exactly how that needs to be worded.

1208
01:39:32,116 --> 01:39:38,779
So I'll just, it sounds like you're agreeable to that, so I'll open the floor to other members of the board.

1209
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:41,640
Questions from the board?

1210
01:39:48,863 --> 01:39:49,764
Go ahead, Jim.

1211
01:39:51,193 --> 01:39:57,519
Do you have any pictures of what the apartment will look like from the outside?

1212
01:39:57,539 --> 01:40:09,630
But it will look exactly like the ground floor, let me share my screen again, looks today.

1213
01:40:09,650 --> 01:40:12,012
We are not proposing any changes to the

1214
01:40:15,282 --> 01:40:37,945
the architecture per se you know we will likely have some type of window treatment on the inside that would allow the resident to you know similar to the upper levels roll the view in and out but this will largely look as it does today it's really just an interior modification and change

1215
01:40:40,494 --> 01:40:42,196
Are those the doors that would be?

1216
01:40:42,216 --> 01:40:48,321
Yeah, these would just stay as is, but we would allow them to be used only for the building.

1217
01:40:48,381 --> 01:40:51,464
We don't anticipate this being a new front door.

1218
01:40:51,904 --> 01:40:59,190
We are not proposing to put on hardware that would allow somebody to come in and walk in this way.

1219
01:40:59,491 --> 01:41:07,518
We prefer actually that these doors stay secure and closed and only in the event of an emergency could be used out of the building.

1220
01:41:09,961 --> 01:41:24,954
Yeah, we really want to direct people in through the existing lobby front door, which is down the page on the left here of this image, grab their mail, packages, and then make their way into the unit through the corridor on the backside.

1221
01:41:24,974 --> 01:41:28,377
Thank you.

1222
01:41:29,809 --> 01:41:35,391
All right, and then I saw hands from both Chris and Andre, and I wasn't paying attention to who raised first.

1223
01:41:35,431 --> 01:41:37,492
So we'll go to Chris next.

1224
01:41:37,592 --> 01:41:38,673
Thank you, Mr. Chair.

1225
01:41:39,213 --> 01:41:52,738
I had a similar question to yours, which is, I assume this must have been permitted under some sort of special permit with site plan review or something similar.

1226
01:41:52,798 --> 01:41:59,461
So I would think the condition for the ground floor retail would have been in that permit.

1227
01:42:01,258 --> 01:42:03,159
Yeah, that's my best guess, Chris.

1228
01:42:03,680 --> 01:42:10,284
But unfortunately, I didn't see in the folder the site plan review, so I wasn't able to independently verify it.

1229
01:42:10,365 --> 01:42:16,509
It sounds like a condition that would be coming recommended by the CD board during that process.

1230
01:42:16,769 --> 01:42:21,112
And a lot of the other letters that were there didn't specifically reference it.

1231
01:42:21,192 --> 01:42:23,094
So that's my operating assumption.

1232
01:42:23,134 --> 01:42:25,155
But like I said, I don't think we have to

1233
01:42:27,327 --> 01:42:29,308
Did not conclusively today.

1234
01:42:30,128 --> 01:42:38,432
We can vote on whether to amend and then figure out the specific language to amend later if the board chooses to approve the amendment.

1235
01:42:39,352 --> 01:42:40,173
OK, thank you.

1236
01:42:40,213 --> 01:42:42,754
All right, Andre.

1237
01:42:45,735 --> 01:42:49,157
Yeah, I was going to ask what Jim was asking.

1238
01:42:49,177 --> 01:42:53,498
I mean, it seems like there should be some modification to the exterior

1239
01:42:57,769 --> 01:42:57,974
Bye.

1240
01:43:00,916 --> 01:43:11,298
I mean, just as a perhaps counterpoint, I think a lot of people look for and like a loft feel apartment.

1241
01:43:11,338 --> 01:43:15,219
This has a ground floor with a tall ceiling and big windows.

1242
01:43:15,279 --> 01:43:29,083
I know it may not look conventional in its residential appearance, but I think would be very appealing and interesting to a number of folks that would consider making this their home and renting it.

1243
01:43:31,443 --> 01:43:32,764
understand your feedback.

1244
01:43:32,784 --> 01:43:38,706
All right.

1245
01:43:39,046 --> 01:43:39,446
Thank you.

1246
01:43:39,826 --> 01:43:40,687
I'll go next.

1247
01:43:41,467 --> 01:43:54,012
Have you talked with anyone in the city departments about the proposal to convert this from retail to residential?

1248
01:43:54,032 --> 01:43:56,653
Do you have any feedback from them on the proposal?

1249
01:43:59,211 --> 01:44:00,752
This is Anne Figueredo once again.

1250
01:44:00,952 --> 01:44:11,955
I spoke to the director, the commissioner in ISD for some direction and just to build upon that with the doors.

1251
01:44:11,975 --> 01:44:14,396
I mean, I'm sure everything will have to be code compliant.

1252
01:44:14,456 --> 01:44:19,617
So I'm sure the building will have things that would want to see that.

1253
01:44:19,977 --> 01:44:23,698
But in the infancy stages, I did talk to

1254
01:44:25,599 --> 01:44:29,161
some of the planning people and I did receive positive feedback.

1255
01:44:30,021 --> 01:44:34,923
I also talked to one of the city counselors last year.

1256
01:44:34,943 --> 01:44:42,787
I'd say last spring, I spoke to Kit Collins and she had some positive feedback.

1257
01:44:44,728 --> 01:44:49,350
You know, at the time, the sphere was debating, you know, should we

1258
01:44:49,930 --> 01:44:54,154
you know, do this or, you know, keep an empty space.

1259
01:44:54,174 --> 01:45:03,782
And I think, you know, it just made so much more sense that, you know, the residential would be much more worthwhile.

1260
01:45:03,963 --> 01:45:06,565
And, you know, as I said, I think

1261
01:45:09,492 --> 01:45:19,039
you know, non-vacant residential unit versus, you know, this blank retail space, you know, is much more attractive.

1262
01:45:19,579 --> 01:45:30,747
I've always felt that, you know, this is almost an attractive nuisance, you know, and they see an empty space and, you know, you don't know, it's almost like a,

1263
01:45:32,957 --> 01:45:41,900
an invitation to, you know, they haven't had any issues, but my fear was the, you know, something could happen if someone notices that it's vacant long enough.

1264
01:45:43,381 --> 01:45:52,904
And I know they get the owners as, you know, they, as Paul did, many of the other tenants in the building have asked, gee, you know, do you think you could make it into an

1265
01:45:53,884 --> 01:45:57,365
a residential unit, I have a friend that would really like to be on a first level.

1266
01:45:57,485 --> 01:46:07,567
So, you know, like I said, I did speak to some of the planning people, you know, Dennis McDougall always gives great direction.

1267
01:46:07,667 --> 01:46:10,568
And, you know, I had conversations with him about it.

1268
01:46:10,628 --> 01:46:21,650
And I did speak to, you know, building department officials, and the most recently the commissioner, but some of the other building inspectors, and they seemed very positive about it.

1269
01:46:23,367 --> 01:46:27,151
And like I said, I did email Kit Collins that we were going forward.

1270
01:46:27,171 --> 01:46:33,879
I haven't heard back from her, but when I initially spoke to her, she seemed positive about it.

1271
01:46:34,099 --> 01:46:36,001
She thought it was a good thought.

1272
01:46:37,823 --> 01:46:38,504
OK, thank you.

1273
01:46:38,524 --> 01:46:41,007
Other questions from the board?

1274
01:46:44,967 --> 01:46:48,794
This is just purely for aesthetic purposes.

1275
01:46:50,217 --> 01:46:54,425
Are there any alternatives for this store?

1276
01:46:57,014 --> 01:47:01,256
For the exterior of the door, it's basically for aesthetic purposes.

1277
01:47:01,296 --> 01:47:04,237
I'm just wondering if there's a possibility for modification.

1278
01:47:04,737 --> 01:47:04,997
Right.

1279
01:47:05,257 --> 01:47:20,622
I mean, I know, you know, I brought this up because they'll have the sphere, you know, with their contractor will have to work with the building department and, you know,

1280
01:47:21,362 --> 01:47:31,810
I'm sure they're going to have to follow building code, but Eric might be able to make some suggestions of alternatives, but I'm sure everything will be code compliant.

1281
01:47:33,331 --> 01:47:41,137
I think from a design perspective and cost perspective, to be honest, it's unlikely that there would be

1282
01:47:43,871 --> 01:47:48,433
design modifications that are kind of structural in nature, changing the windows, et cetera.

1283
01:47:48,453 --> 01:48:10,484
I mean, there could be an opportunity to provide some type of translucent film or something like that to maybe change the character of the glass, but unlikely to pull out the doors and replace it with something else, given the cost of construction.

1284
01:48:12,405 --> 01:48:16,629
the pressure on that for the success of this project.

1285
01:48:16,710 --> 01:48:33,707
And I know early on when we first started looking at it, we thought, oh, it'd be really interesting to put like an infill, that whole little recessed area with a planter and, you know, have some plants or whatever growing, you know, in the container in that space.

1286
01:48:33,807 --> 01:48:33,967
But

1287
01:48:34,728 --> 01:48:38,451
from a building code perspective we needed the second means of egress.

1288
01:48:38,991 --> 01:48:52,902
The first will be going out through the front door of the apartment which goes out into that hallway to an egress door and then the second means of egress again emergency would be out one of these double doors.

1289
01:48:54,203 --> 01:49:03,590
So the idea of kind of putting a planter there seemed like a you know non-starter to comply with building code but yeah so

1290
01:49:05,363 --> 01:49:17,087
Long answer is probably not going to be any major design opportunities to transform the storefront, but there could be some minor applications that could be considered, I suppose.

1291
01:49:20,908 --> 01:49:23,189
Thank you.

1292
01:49:24,389 --> 01:49:30,511
Along the lines of where Mary was going with this, I understand

1293
01:49:31,725 --> 01:49:36,227
It's not technically required to revisit the Community Development Board.

1294
01:49:37,822 --> 01:49:40,323
before asking for an amendment to the variance.

1295
01:49:40,343 --> 01:49:46,026
We certainly have some first-hand knowledge of the challenges filling the space.

1296
01:49:47,106 --> 01:49:59,211
If we were going back to 2015, the zoning board at that time felt it was necessary to impose a condition that we think came from the CD board at the time during the required site plan review.

1297
01:49:59,231 --> 01:50:04,953
Have you considered going back before the CD board and just getting their take on the proposal?

1298
01:50:11,962 --> 01:50:33,803
Because otherwise the zoning board is going to be trying to decide between, well, does the experience you've had filling this retail space and the hardship it's created, is that enough to revisit and compensate for the prior

1299
01:50:35,102 --> 01:50:40,386
recommendation from the CD board that the zoning board felt was necessary to impose.

1300
01:50:40,886 --> 01:50:46,911
So, you know, if you could, if you just went before the CD board, it would perhaps put that issue to rest.

1301
01:50:51,174 --> 01:50:56,017
So are you asking us to go to the CD board and come back or?

1302
01:50:56,038 --> 01:50:57,879
Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't.

1303
01:50:58,652 --> 01:51:04,774
take it to the extreme of me specifically asking you to do that, but I'm just presenting some possible options.

1304
01:51:04,834 --> 01:51:12,417
It sounds like you haven't considered that, or at least haven't chosen to do that yet.

1305
01:51:13,438 --> 01:51:24,342
I don't think it would be required for the board to render a decision for you to make that visit, and I understand it adds time and potential costs, but just in terms of what you're asking the board to do,

1306
01:51:25,389 --> 01:51:27,431
You're sharing your experience renting the space.

1307
01:51:27,511 --> 01:51:29,112
The board can certainly weigh in on that.

1308
01:51:29,793 --> 01:51:31,514
We can share historical information.

1309
01:51:31,534 --> 01:51:38,740
The CDE board made the recommendation that required this retail space in the past.

1310
01:51:38,840 --> 01:51:45,946
So if you were to go before them, they could clarify now, with the benefit of this information, whether their view has also changed.

1311
01:51:55,295 --> 01:51:56,536
Anyway, just just throwing that out there.

1312
01:51:56,556 --> 01:51:58,718
I'm not trying to like, there's no hidden message.

1313
01:51:58,758 --> 01:52:02,040
I'm not trying to process.

1314
01:52:02,141 --> 01:52:10,968
I mean, I think if the board board, I mean, perhaps we could have the architect meet with someone from the CD board for, you know.

1315
01:52:11,788 --> 01:52:15,671
direction on some design so that, you know, we're not coming back.

1316
01:52:15,751 --> 01:52:34,103
And it's like you said, it ended up being, you know, it could be a six month ordeal, or it just might be faster to say, well, if the board is comfortable with voting to approve, perhaps a condition of that is the architects tech work CD board on, you know, some design matters.

1317
01:52:35,376 --> 01:52:40,861
Right, we have to be careful in how we worded it, so it couldn't be conditional on a CD board approval.

1318
01:52:40,921 --> 01:52:52,690
But yeah, we could have some language saying, you know, conditional on the architect talking with the CD board to review some design considerations.

1319
01:52:53,251 --> 01:52:53,991
That's a good point.

1320
01:52:55,793 --> 01:52:57,534
Yeah, I try to keep it simplified.

1321
01:52:57,574 --> 01:53:01,998
I figured that to less confusion, more simplified.

1322
01:53:04,853 --> 01:53:08,194
Okay, other questions from the board?

1323
01:53:08,214 --> 01:53:14,476
All right, we will open it up to public comment.

1324
01:53:14,596 --> 01:53:19,878
If you're a member of the public and you'd like to speak on this matter, you may do so now.

1325
01:53:19,978 --> 01:53:26,300
You can raise your hand on Zoom, type in the chat, turn on your camera and raise your hand.

1326
01:53:27,020 --> 01:53:29,881
You can email Dennis dmcdougall at medford-ma.gov.

1327
01:53:32,049 --> 01:53:38,817
I believe Attorney Vigarito already mentioned that there are a bunch of letters of support from residents and one of the neighboring businesses.

1328
01:53:38,837 --> 01:53:47,907
Yeah, Shereen Cousins, please state your name and address for the record.

1329
01:53:49,175 --> 01:53:52,077
My name is Shireen Cousins, 71 Riverside Avenue.

1330
01:53:52,097 --> 01:54:09,768
I came in a little bit late to the meeting and I just was trying to understand, is it finalized that it's not going to be a retail property anymore and you're definitely changing it to an apartment location?

1331
01:54:10,348 --> 01:54:12,650
Are we trying to decide that right now in this meeting?

1332
01:54:13,613 --> 01:54:14,073
Great question.

1333
01:54:14,093 --> 01:54:23,720
So the request is back in 2015, the zoning board approved some variances, which included a condition that that ground floor be retail.

1334
01:54:24,580 --> 01:54:32,966
And the request is that the board amend that decision to remove the condition that the ground floor be retail.

1335
01:54:33,146 --> 01:54:36,989
So it seems the intention is to convert it into residential.

1336
01:54:37,629 --> 01:54:40,491
And so the board's deciding whether to remove that condition.

1337
01:54:41,398 --> 01:54:42,899
Okay, definitely understand.

1338
01:54:43,319 --> 01:55:04,051
My only concern with it being now apartments, I think it may be other people's concern as well, is the visual aspect and the safety of it living on the ground floor and people having that much access, whether the glasses are not, if somebody can just peer through, that's a little invasive.

1339
01:55:04,131 --> 01:55:05,472
So that's just my thoughts.

1340
01:55:05,492 --> 01:55:06,613
All right.

1341
01:55:06,893 --> 01:55:07,173
Thank you.

1342
01:55:10,095 --> 01:55:13,338
Other comments from members of the public?

1343
01:55:21,524 --> 01:55:23,926
I do not see any.

1344
01:55:24,286 --> 01:55:30,070
So the chair awaits a motion to close the public portion of the hearing and enter deliberation.

1345
01:55:30,090 --> 01:55:33,133
So moved.

1346
01:55:34,154 --> 01:55:34,554
Second.

1347
01:55:34,934 --> 01:55:35,194
Second.

1348
01:55:35,374 --> 01:55:36,776
OK, we'll take a roll call.

1349
01:55:37,736 --> 01:55:38,057
Chris?

1350
01:55:39,262 --> 01:55:39,402
Aye.

1351
01:55:39,842 --> 01:55:40,122
Aye.

1352
01:55:40,662 --> 01:55:41,102
Mary.

1353
01:55:41,122 --> 01:55:41,923
Aye.

1354
01:55:42,483 --> 01:55:42,883
Jim.

1355
01:55:43,463 --> 01:55:43,603
Aye.

1356
01:55:44,723 --> 01:55:45,023
Mike.

1357
01:55:45,444 --> 01:55:45,584
Aye.

1358
01:55:45,904 --> 01:55:47,144
All right, we are now deliberating.

1359
01:55:47,184 --> 01:55:48,004
What do you think, folks?

1360
01:55:53,345 --> 01:56:03,288
I guess one thing I'll clarify as we deliberate my read on the original variance is that changing from

1361
01:56:05,487 --> 01:56:15,551
Retail to residential doesn't fundamentally change the hardship that they needed to demonstrate at the time for the variance.

1362
01:56:15,591 --> 01:56:30,917
So I do think the board can basically consider, in light of this additional hardship, whether to amend the variance in some manner, which could include changing a condition or removing a condition.

1363
01:56:37,773 --> 01:56:38,074
Andre.

1364
01:56:39,382 --> 01:56:39,804
Thanks, Mike.

1365
01:56:41,285 --> 01:56:49,569
It's been 10 years since the project has been permitted and they've only had for eight months of that whole time.

1366
01:56:49,889 --> 01:56:53,951
I do understand the issue here.

1367
01:56:53,971 --> 01:57:09,858
It's a little unfortunate, I think, but probably the best outcome that we can hope for is to put a residential unit in there if they're not going to expand the amenity space down below.

1368
01:57:12,367 --> 01:57:13,628
All right, thanks, Andre.

1369
01:57:13,828 --> 01:57:15,008
Other thoughts from the board?

1370
01:57:21,131 --> 01:57:21,511
Chris.

1371
01:57:22,812 --> 01:57:40,860
Yeah, I mean, not to belabor the point either, but back to the original point, do they really just need to amend the special permit and the zoning board even

1372
01:57:42,807 --> 01:57:45,228
had jurisdiction over.

1373
01:57:45,248 --> 01:57:58,695
Yeah, so Chris, what I know with certainty with the info we have is that the zoning board imposed as a condition any recommendation that was in the CD board letter.

1374
01:57:59,796 --> 01:58:00,476
That part I know.

1375
01:58:00,496 --> 01:58:08,260
Just transferred everything from the special permit from the CD board over to what became a variance.

1376
01:58:09,528 --> 01:58:11,770
Yeah, I mean, at the time, the zoning was different.

1377
01:58:12,031 --> 01:58:16,775
I think special permits were somewhat more narrow, at least.

1378
01:58:16,875 --> 01:58:21,340
So I don't, I haven't done like the full legal diff then and now.

1379
01:58:21,460 --> 01:58:30,730
But, but yeah, it's, if indeed it is the case, which that is my understanding that the zoning board

1380
01:58:32,120 --> 01:58:43,072
imposed as a condition of the variance this requirement, then it would be inadequate to merely modify a special permit.

1381
01:58:43,172 --> 01:58:45,114
It does require an amendment.

1382
01:58:46,052 --> 01:58:47,713
was referenced in the original.

1383
01:58:48,333 --> 01:58:50,774
It was like a non-conforming structure.

1384
01:58:50,794 --> 01:59:04,738
They can change the use by special permit subject to some, we'd have to make a determination, but since it's in the variance, it was only allowed by variance, that's the variance itself needs to be amended.

1385
01:59:04,758 --> 01:59:08,020
Okay.

1386
01:59:08,780 --> 01:59:11,481
Yeah, it seems odd, but I'll go with that.

1387
01:59:14,376 --> 01:59:21,244
That's my only, I don't have, you know, honestly, to the point of the project, um, I know this is happening.

1388
01:59:22,998 --> 01:59:46,394
uh you know across a lot of valuable real estate so it's not surprising to me that these folks are here for us to request this um i do you know it would be nice to know that at some point perhaps when things get busier once again at these once current being

1389
01:59:47,403 --> 01:59:55,487
commercial in some way, you know, but it will be of course up to the owner, whatever is more profitable, seek that.

1390
01:59:56,788 --> 01:59:57,028
Yeah.

1391
01:59:57,068 --> 02:00:05,052
So Chris, if we were to remove the condition that it be a retail space,

1392
02:00:06,330 --> 02:00:22,261
and so the applicant intends to convert it to retail, if they then in the future wanted to convert it to residential, they then in the future wanted to convert it back to retail, it would just require a special permit.

1393
02:00:22,281 --> 02:00:31,588
It's only modify the variance if there was a condition that needs to go away, changing the use of

1394
02:00:32,587 --> 02:00:36,972
non-conforming structure, which would still be non-conforming, that's just a special permit.

1395
02:00:37,772 --> 02:00:40,915
Yeah, that's what I would hope that would be the case, right?

1396
02:00:43,578 --> 02:00:45,120
Other thoughts from the board?

1397
02:00:47,958 --> 02:00:59,349
So Mike will be voting what the condition of the architect, the CD for, or are we just voting for the amendment?

1398
02:00:59,729 --> 02:01:03,253
So that's for the board to determine.

1399
02:01:03,413 --> 02:01:10,840
The relief required is the outright removal or modification of the condition requiring the retail space.

1400
02:01:11,840 --> 02:01:19,943
But in modifying the variance, the board could impose other conditions within its purview.

1401
02:01:19,983 --> 02:01:33,987
So we could, for example, remove the requirement that it be a retail space and add the condition that the architect discuss with members of the board.

1402
02:01:36,575 --> 02:01:44,222
City Planning Department and the Community Development Board possible design choices for the ground floor unit or something like that.

1403
02:01:50,488 --> 02:01:51,209
Andre?

1404
02:01:52,710 --> 02:01:54,072
Just on that issue, you know,

1405
02:01:57,628 --> 02:02:00,490
I feel that that has very little benefit.

1406
02:02:01,051 --> 02:02:11,579
The CD board members are not the same as the ones that this project and I don't really see what they're going to be able to do at this point.

1407
02:02:11,599 --> 02:02:20,486
Yeah, I'm not necessarily in favor of adding another condition.

1408
02:02:22,086 --> 02:02:24,408
A condition like that has limited legal teeth.

1409
02:02:25,068 --> 02:02:36,098
It signals the zoning board's desire and requires a conversation, but it can't require an approval.

1410
02:02:36,158 --> 02:02:38,119
Legally, those don't hold up anyway.

1411
02:02:40,061 --> 02:02:47,668
In that sense, the condition for signaling, I think, then legal teeth.

1412
02:02:54,050 --> 02:02:57,154
Other thoughts from the board?

1413
02:02:57,174 --> 02:03:10,751
Yeah, I mean, my take, I think 10 years is a long time.

1414
02:03:12,851 --> 02:03:21,613
I do think there was ample incentive for the owner to try to find a tenant, and clearly they struggled mightily.

1415
02:03:22,193 --> 02:03:33,896
Also, the location, while somewhat nearby other retail businesses, it is a bit of an odd walk.

1416
02:03:33,956 --> 02:03:35,276
It's on an island of sorts.

1417
02:03:35,496 --> 02:03:39,317
So I do see the hardship in this case.

1418
02:03:41,073 --> 02:03:44,214
And I'm comfortable proceeding.

1419
02:03:44,274 --> 02:03:47,694
I don't think we need to have an additional checkpoint.

1420
02:03:47,934 --> 02:03:50,575
I don't want to unnecessarily delay things further.

1421
02:03:50,715 --> 02:03:52,835
So that's all.

1422
02:03:52,915 --> 02:04:01,637
I think from a legal perspective, modification is the same criteria used to justify the variance before would apply to this new proposal.

1423
02:04:01,797 --> 02:04:09,678
And it's just more of a board determination whether we're comfortable removing that condition or modifying it.

1424
02:04:14,685 --> 02:04:27,132
Mr. Chair, I move to approve to remove the condition on the variance requiring commercial space on the first floor.

1425
02:04:27,152 --> 02:04:28,533
All right.

1426
02:04:28,593 --> 02:04:29,213
Do we have a second?

1427
02:04:29,493 --> 02:04:30,074
I'll second.

1428
02:04:31,314 --> 02:04:31,694
OK.

1429
02:04:32,155 --> 02:04:34,256
We're going to take a vote.

1430
02:04:34,736 --> 02:04:35,216
Andre?

1431
02:04:35,236 --> 02:04:35,977
Aye.

1432
02:04:36,737 --> 02:04:37,198
Chris?

1433
02:04:37,718 --> 02:04:37,838
Aye.

1434
02:04:38,378 --> 02:04:38,818
Mary?

1435
02:04:39,459 --> 02:04:39,579
Aye.

1436
02:04:40,419 --> 02:04:40,759
Jim?

1437
02:04:41,480 --> 02:04:41,620
Aye.

1438
02:04:42,466 --> 02:04:43,366
Mike, aye.

1439
02:04:43,386 --> 02:04:46,887
All right, the variance is hereby amended.

1440
02:04:47,547 --> 02:04:49,887
We'll work on putting that into writing.

1441
02:04:49,947 --> 02:04:58,689
We'll figure out the precise way to word it so it has legal bite or clout so you can do the modification.

1442
02:04:59,129 --> 02:05:01,849
Dennis, any other logistical items on this one?

1443
02:05:02,789 --> 02:05:03,490
No, I don't think so.

1444
02:05:03,510 --> 02:05:08,990
But actually, do a first pass at it and send it over to me just to my expedite matters.

1445
02:05:09,051 --> 02:05:11,631
If you can do that, that would probably help matters quite a bit.

1446
02:05:12,379 --> 02:05:12,619
All right.

1447
02:05:12,740 --> 02:05:16,284
Yeah, my office will run that and you know, we'll converse with you.

1448
02:05:16,665 --> 02:05:17,045
Exactly.

1449
02:05:17,105 --> 02:05:19,268
I'll be here to be a sounding board as well.

1450
02:05:20,330 --> 02:05:21,031
Thank you so much.

1451
02:05:21,852 --> 02:05:22,232
That's great.

1452
02:05:22,252 --> 02:05:22,713
Thanks, folks.

1453
02:05:22,773 --> 02:05:23,254
Have a good night.

1454
02:05:24,455 --> 02:05:24,996
Thank you.

1455
02:05:25,076 --> 02:05:25,457
Good night.

1456
02:05:25,497 --> 02:05:26,258
Thank you very much.

1457
02:05:26,278 --> 02:05:26,919
Have a great evening.

1458
02:05:26,939 --> 02:05:27,520
Thank you very much.

1459
02:05:29,348 --> 02:05:32,669
All right, so what's next, Dennis?

1460
02:05:32,689 --> 02:05:34,369
289 Fellsway West, case number A-2025-07.

1461
02:05:34,469 --> 02:05:48,973
Applicant and owner, Edmond DeMori, to change a single-family home at 289 Fellsway West to a two-family home in a general residence zoning district allowed use within a sufficient lot area lot width per the City Method Zoning Ordinance, Chapter 94, Table B, Table of Dimensional Requirements.

1462
02:05:51,333 --> 02:05:56,135
All right, I see we have someone named Edmond here, so is that you?

1463
02:05:56,935 --> 02:05:57,455
Hi, welcome.

1464
02:06:03,145 --> 02:06:04,386
You're currently on mute.

1465
02:06:05,147 --> 02:06:06,148
Sorry.

1466
02:06:07,929 --> 02:06:08,129
Hi.

1467
02:06:09,430 --> 02:06:09,751
Welcome.

1468
02:06:09,791 --> 02:06:12,353
Yeah, so we are hearing your case.

1469
02:06:12,413 --> 02:06:15,976
I know you made a submit, provided a bunch of details.

1470
02:06:16,316 --> 02:06:18,758
Is there anything you'd like to present to the board?

1471
02:06:19,659 --> 02:06:21,480
I just want to say thank you for the opportunity.

1472
02:06:21,500 --> 02:06:24,543
I did plans that I have submitted.

1473
02:06:25,543 --> 02:06:29,527
The house was a single family, got approved for two floors.

1474
02:06:31,068 --> 02:06:34,791
single family, and I'm just trying to make it a two-family.

1475
02:06:36,252 --> 02:06:44,018
And I did provide parking and basically the only thing I need is the lot size that I don't have.

1476
02:06:44,839 --> 02:06:49,283
I'm just trying to see if I can get the approval.

1477
02:06:49,303 --> 02:06:54,647
Okay, Dennis, could you maybe help so we can... Yeah, I'm jumping on that now.

1478
02:07:06,460 --> 02:07:07,181
Is it showing up?

1479
02:07:07,861 --> 02:07:08,121
Yes.

1480
02:07:08,482 --> 02:07:08,802
OK, great.

1481
02:07:12,045 --> 02:07:13,566
All right, so we're looking at the plan.

1482
02:07:13,586 --> 02:07:19,210
So can you maybe walk us through the petition?

1483
02:07:19,291 --> 02:07:32,922
So we need, you do need a, actually, is it, Dennis, is this a variance or a special permit to change the use?

1484
02:07:36,021 --> 02:07:41,524
I know a lot of the dimensional violations are staying the same.

1485
02:07:42,105 --> 02:07:51,490
It's a variance because it's going from a single to a two, the lot width and the lot area are increasing, which would then- Right, got it.

1486
02:07:51,510 --> 02:07:55,052
Yeah, that's my reading on the ordinance as well.

1487
02:07:55,092 --> 02:07:55,412
Okay.

1488
02:07:55,952 --> 02:08:03,837
So yeah, so Edmund, as part of the petition for the variance, you need to

1489
02:08:05,521 --> 02:08:24,959
The board is going to need to associate something unusual with the shape, topography, or soil conditions of the lot and or structures with the hardship

1490
02:08:26,317 --> 02:08:29,938
in literally enforcing the zoning ordinance.

1491
02:08:29,998 --> 02:08:31,878
So this is a GR district.

1492
02:08:31,958 --> 02:08:33,739
The use is allowed by right.

1493
02:08:33,919 --> 02:08:37,879
If the dimensional requirements are satisfied, they are not.

1494
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:48,102
So if you could walk us through the unusual aspects of the lot and or structures, as well as the hardship.

1495
02:08:51,782 --> 02:08:54,943
So currently, it used to be a single family with one floor.

1496
02:08:57,254 --> 02:09:01,599
I got the approval for permit number BRP24-00416.

1497
02:09:12,070 --> 02:09:21,875
And based on that permit, the house got demolished, a whole new foundation, and we got a new basement and first floor and second floor.

1498
02:09:22,255 --> 02:09:29,218
Got approved for five bedrooms, a living room, and three-fold bath, one in the basement, and one on the first floor, and one on the second floor.

1499
02:09:29,258 --> 02:09:31,339
And that's what currently we have right now.

1500
02:09:32,960 --> 02:09:37,562
But I was just wondering if I, since I already, I'm not changing,

1501
02:09:38,500 --> 02:09:42,842
The height or anything has been the way it is right now from the outside.

1502
02:09:42,862 --> 02:09:46,384
I'm only converting it to two families that are single family.

1503
02:09:48,925 --> 02:09:53,987
So everything will stay the same the way it is right now, per the permit that I was just gave you earlier.

1504
02:09:54,467 --> 02:10:05,332
Just the adjustment will be for like the second floor will have two easements where like the main one and the backup one for emergency and the same thing for the first floor.

1505
02:10:06,402 --> 02:10:11,446
and three parking lot being provided and nothing's outside of the house.

1506
02:10:11,486 --> 02:10:13,388
It still has the same exact dimensions.

1507
02:10:17,531 --> 02:10:20,133
Okay, questions from the board so far?

1508
02:10:28,240 --> 02:10:33,604
Dennis, we also have the architectural plans, is that right?

1509
02:10:33,644 --> 02:10:34,425
Is that something you could

1510
02:10:35,086 --> 02:10:37,542
Right, just provide the new plan how it looks like.

1511
02:11:05,047 --> 02:11:12,709
I'm not sure which one of these is the best one to show for your benefit, but I can slowly scroll through them if you want me to stop.

1512
02:11:14,430 --> 02:11:20,852
Yeah, and then maybe you could just tell us what we're looking at and Dennis can... That's the front of, if you look at that, that's the front of the house.

1513
02:11:21,672 --> 02:11:26,974
And the side of it is the entrance to go up to the first floor and then you continue to the second floor.

1514
02:11:27,814 --> 02:11:34,316
And then if you go into that little sunroom, then that'll be the entrance to the first floor and stairs going up to the second floor.

1515
02:11:36,783 --> 02:11:38,824
And the layout of the house is the same.

1516
02:11:39,564 --> 02:11:48,628
First and second floor, you'll have a, you'll walk into the kitchen, then you have a dining room or living room behind it, then a full bath and two bedrooms in the back.

1517
02:11:51,249 --> 02:11:54,070
And pretty much the same layout for the first and the second floor.

1518
02:11:54,131 --> 02:12:01,113
All right.

1519
02:12:03,374 --> 02:12:04,495
Questions from the board?

1520
02:12:09,054 --> 02:12:09,374
Chris?

1521
02:12:11,816 --> 02:12:17,401
I'm sorry, I'm having trouble pulling up my version of the application.

1522
02:12:17,421 --> 02:12:22,344
How much direct dimensional relief are we talking about, if any?

1523
02:12:24,226 --> 02:12:27,268
Or is it all setback?

1524
02:12:27,908 --> 02:12:34,974
So if I'm reading it correctly, Chris, the lot area is 3,300 square foot.

1525
02:12:37,749 --> 02:12:46,452
And required is, it looks like it says 10,000, I think it's 6,000, but that's what I saw in the table of use.

1526
02:12:47,813 --> 02:12:48,233
Right.

1527
02:12:48,393 --> 02:12:49,633
It's 3300 right now.

1528
02:12:50,433 --> 02:12:51,414
Yeah.

1529
02:12:52,734 --> 02:12:52,934
Yeah.

1530
02:12:52,974 --> 02:12:57,936
And so, um, in the current use, which is a single family, the required is 5,000.

1531
02:12:57,976 --> 02:13:01,057
Um, and then additionally, the.

1532
02:13:05,111 --> 02:13:06,592
Lot frontage required is 50.

1533
02:13:06,852 --> 02:13:15,679
And the... Wait, did I do that right?

1534
02:13:15,899 --> 02:13:20,342
No, it's... Yeah, the required is 50, it's 35.

1535
02:13:20,522 --> 02:13:23,485
The required width is 100, it's 35.

1536
02:13:23,525 --> 02:13:24,405
The required depth is 103.84.

1537
02:13:36,132 --> 02:13:45,555
So yeah, in terms of the ones that would actually change the- so I think the frontage is actually supposed to be 35.

1538
02:13:46,315 --> 02:13:48,696
That's what I'm seeing in the table of dimensional requirements.

1539
02:13:50,596 --> 02:13:56,998
So the change in use imposes an additional requirement of 1,000 feet from 5,000 to 6,000.

1540
02:13:57,078 --> 02:13:57,158
Yeah.

1541
02:13:57,178 --> 02:13:59,799
Then in terms of the width 50 to 60 and the depth from,

1542
02:14:05,464 --> 02:14:08,306
55 to 60.

1543
02:14:10,768 --> 02:14:12,809
Variance is required for lot area.

1544
02:14:13,650 --> 02:14:14,290
It's 3,300 versus the now 6,000.

1545
02:14:14,330 --> 02:14:15,111
The frontage looks okay.

1546
02:14:15,291 --> 02:14:20,235
The depth, it's 35, used to need to be 50, now it needs to be 60.

1547
02:14:20,935 --> 02:14:22,857
The depth is fine.

1548
02:14:32,739 --> 02:14:35,640
I may have missed something in my summary, but high level that's.

1549
02:14:35,920 --> 02:14:38,861
And the height, do you know about the height?

1550
02:14:41,822 --> 02:14:42,362
Height.

1551
02:14:43,362 --> 02:14:49,144
So the height is 31.35 foot.

1552
02:14:49,844 --> 02:14:54,446
And the height... Proposed height is 31.

1553
02:14:54,706 --> 02:14:56,607
I think that's the proposed height, yeah.

1554
02:14:56,727 --> 02:14:57,827
And the allowed...

1555
02:14:59,660 --> 02:15:00,080
Height is 35.

1556
02:15:00,160 --> 02:15:02,082
So height is five.

1557
02:15:02,342 --> 02:15:02,562
Yeah.

1558
02:15:03,122 --> 02:15:03,342
Okay.

1559
02:15:03,543 --> 02:15:05,444
That, that was, that was good.

1560
02:15:05,504 --> 02:15:05,824
Thank you.

1561
02:15:05,964 --> 02:15:09,506
Um, that's essentially what I was curious about.

1562
02:15:09,546 --> 02:15:22,415
It looks like a question, I guess, for the applicant is you're going to build a basement level with perhaps, uh, doesn't exist right now.

1563
02:15:22,515 --> 02:15:23,736
Or is that, is that what I'm saying?

1564
02:15:23,776 --> 02:15:25,157
It's already existing right now.

1565
02:15:25,877 --> 02:15:27,158
Like what you see on the plan.

1566
02:15:27,870 --> 02:15:29,270
That's just the plan.

1567
02:15:29,831 --> 02:15:35,452
It's already been built based on the level, first floor and second floor as a single family.

1568
02:15:35,472 --> 02:15:38,693
It's already been approved and built.

1569
02:15:39,093 --> 02:15:42,014
Okay, I'm seeing it on the map that I'm pulling up.

1570
02:15:42,054 --> 02:15:46,835
Maybe it looks like there is not a basement level, but.

1571
02:15:49,116 --> 02:15:51,937
No, you do have, you walk if you go back to that map.

1572
02:16:04,505 --> 02:16:05,326
You're on mute, Edmund.

1573
02:16:08,087 --> 02:16:08,387
Sorry.

1574
02:16:09,508 --> 02:16:14,791
So you do have a beta from the front, and then on the side of the stairs, you go up to the first floor, then the second floor.

1575
02:16:17,132 --> 02:16:17,412
Okay.

1576
02:16:17,532 --> 02:16:19,413
And that's what's there currently?

1577
02:16:19,953 --> 02:16:20,193
Right.

1578
02:16:20,213 --> 02:16:22,975
All right.

1579
02:16:23,775 --> 02:16:31,439
I don't see that on the map that I'm looking at, but maybe I'm looking at the wrong building, perhaps.

1580
02:16:38,745 --> 02:16:40,169
Dennis, you had your hand up.

1581
02:16:41,272 --> 02:16:43,017
Would you like to share something?

1582
02:16:45,992 --> 02:16:48,474
Yeah, it was just while you were working through the dimensional stuff.

1583
02:16:49,315 --> 02:17:00,323
Yeah, you basically got it right that it's by going from a single to a two, the lot area goes from 5,000 to 6,000, and the lot width goes from 50 feet to 60 feet.

1584
02:17:00,404 --> 02:17:04,767
Those are the two things that they need to get the variances on.

1585
02:17:05,107 --> 02:17:09,171
Everything else is within acceptable numbers.

1586
02:17:11,212 --> 02:17:11,452
All right.

1587
02:17:12,013 --> 02:17:12,553
Thank you, Dennis.

1588
02:17:12,954 --> 02:17:14,455
Other questions from the board?

1589
02:17:15,887 --> 02:17:19,190
Um, I just want to make sure I heard the structure.

1590
02:17:19,230 --> 02:17:21,152
Second floor is already completed built.

1591
02:17:21,792 --> 02:17:22,613
Is that what you're saying?

1592
02:17:22,773 --> 02:17:23,274
What you said?

1593
02:17:24,755 --> 02:17:25,015
Right.

1594
02:17:26,477 --> 02:17:26,617
Yeah.

1595
02:17:26,637 --> 02:17:28,839
So Mary, my originally, sorry.

1596
02:17:29,059 --> 02:17:30,060
Oh, yeah.

1597
02:17:30,601 --> 02:17:32,943
I was just going to say, and please chime in Edmund.

1598
02:17:33,103 --> 02:17:38,568
Um, I think it's an alternate configuration of thing structure.

1599
02:17:39,728 --> 02:17:50,580
that would make it a two-family, and it does not change the footprint in any way of the existing, it does require some modifications for egress and so on.

1600
02:17:51,461 --> 02:17:52,623
Right, okay.

1601
02:17:56,467 --> 02:17:59,511
Other questions on the board?

1602
02:18:01,163 --> 02:18:08,207
Yeah, I'm just trying to, you know, look on the map and the different angles of these, of the property.

1603
02:18:08,287 --> 02:18:16,971
And I'm just, it looks so close to the adjacent properties that I'm, can you just explain again how the.

1604
02:18:17,011 --> 02:18:23,474
Yeah, it's, I don't know how to explain it.

1605
02:18:23,555 --> 02:18:25,215
It's five feet from the other property.

1606
02:18:25,255 --> 02:18:25,996
It used to be single.

1607
02:18:26,016 --> 02:18:29,978
We use the same footprint and instead of having one level and one up to two levels.

1608
02:18:31,332 --> 02:18:31,612
Right.

1609
02:18:31,833 --> 02:18:35,157
And that, but, and what was that permit to go from one level?

1610
02:18:35,978 --> 02:18:44,287
It used to be just one level single family and the permit gave us the okay to make a single family, two levels.

1611
02:18:44,928 --> 02:18:48,292
That was the, that was just like, just through the building.

1612
02:18:48,933 --> 02:18:49,193
Right.

1613
02:18:50,535 --> 02:18:50,755
Right.

1614
02:18:53,298 --> 02:18:58,024
They got converted from single family, one level to single family, two levels.

1615
02:18:58,785 --> 02:18:58,925
Yeah.

1616
02:18:58,945 --> 02:18:59,766
So Andre,
