    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=0.142s">comment</a>  on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1.643s">So</a>  my concern is that we're creating a situation that could be made worse.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=14.155s">Yeah,</a>  I need to double check. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=16.517s">I</a>  don't recall the status of whether there's already a permit issued for the sewer. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=24.523s">And</a>  I know the building commissioners on vacation. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=26.864s">Dennis,</a>  do you happen to know, even if there is a permit issued, if this would trigger the need for a new permit? <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=38.089s">Let</a>  me look it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=39.83s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=39.99s">I</a>  think they'll look up the current status of the permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=45.954s">the</a>  permit as well.</p>

    <p>[_Zabvvh8vxM_SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=48.656s">Mr.</a>  Chair, I think the question that I raised at the last meeting was about the sewer lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=60.764s">One</a>  question was about the quality of the line, which the video seek to answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=66.347s">But</a>  the other question is simply, where does the sewer line run? <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=70.665s">And</a>  that seems to be something that the city engineer should weigh in on. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=76.466s">And</a>  I don't understand, I haven't seen this back and forth with the emails and what the city engineer basically declined to answer saying that it was a matter between two, but how can we as a board, I mean, we need to see where the utilities run and to be able to evaluate whether there's a detriment to <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=97.23s">the</a>  neighborhood, you know, if there's one that's in poor condition.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=105.654s">Dennis,</a>  maybe, could you reread the specific wording from the city engineer?</p>

    <p>[Denis MacDougall]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=110.736s">I</a>  just want to make sure the... I can, but I just forwarded it to you as well, so it's in your QK.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=118.84s">I</a>  don't have it yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=123.502s">Oh,</a>  here we go.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=126.065s">All</a>  right, so I don't see the original message, but the first response we see says, hi, Edmund, the engineering division will not comment regarding private property matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=147.439s">My</a>  previous email was relative to the overall building permit condition set forth by engineering water source stated on permits, some numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=156.706s">And</a>  then in some of the back and forth, the assistant city engineer <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=173.44s">mentions</a>  that the permits themselves can be viewed on CitizenServe. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=176.781s">So</a>  I'm looking for those now. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=180.922s">So</a>  we have numbers for the permits.</p>

    <p>[_Zabvvh8vxM_SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=185.904s">If</a>  I could ask a question in the meantime to Ed. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=191.585s">I'm</a>  just wondering, Ed, your best understanding is that your sewer line connects to Fern Road?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=201.97s">I</a>  know 100% for a fact the sewer line connects from my property into their property into Fern Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=209.875s">It's</a>  a 100% video, you guys can do a site visit, I can show you the exact mark for it, for the water and the sewer. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=216.96s">And</a>  the gas line was already got removed from National Grid because it's a regular reasonable price to remove it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=223.884s">It</a>  costs a reasonable price to remove, but the estimates that I got in the store, they're outrageous. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=228.51s">Like</a>  you're looking between $30,000 to $40,000 to get it removed and replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=233.86s">When</a>  I had a conversation with them, I was off the line.</p>

    <p>[_Zabvvh8vxM_SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=239.285s">I</a>  just wanted to ask a question about the fact I don't want to get back into that discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=243.289s">I</a>  just want to. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=244.53s">So</a>  you're because your video, it was longer than the other one. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=248.915s">It's</a>  that's does it almost seem to me it was very straight and long. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=253.279s">And</a>  are you sure it doesn't connect into the film?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=256.543s">It</a>  does not connect to the Felsway. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=258.865s">I'm</a>  100% sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=260.766s">It</a>  goes from my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=262.708s">I</a>  have it marked on my site and I got it marked from Fern Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=267.011s">At</a>  first, we thought it connects from their house into my house and connects together and go down along the wall of the gas station into the Felsway. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=278.501s">And</a>  we were under oppression, that's where the line is. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=281.082s">And</a>  the first attempt of recording that line, by request from Emmett, went to a place where it's completely dry, hadn't been used in years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=292.649s">So</a>  I dug out that side of the pipe, supposedly end, and realized it comes to the wall behind the gas station. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=300.893s">So</a>  I end up... <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=303.011s">dragging</a>  out a little bit more before it used to be a front yard, and the sewer line was Nick. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=309.118s">And</a>  that's when we realized it goes from my house into their house in Deferred Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=315.264s">And</a>  the reason I thought they're connected together, because Rob was under the impression that our line and his line are connected together. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=323.553s">Based</a>  on their video today, I'm going to assume that they have a separate line than mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=329.234s">We</a>  can't, there is no way we are connected together because that's the sewer line. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=334.875s">I'm</a>  like a million percent sure it goes from Fern Road into my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=339.756s">And</a>  their video, it's got to be for a separate line that goes from their house.</p>

    <p>[_Zabvvh8vxM_SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=345.577s">All</a>  right, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=347.017s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=347.617s">I</a>  mean, I just, this is kind of why I feel like <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=351.777s">need</a>  the city engineer to kind of tell us where the utility is. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=357.699s">I</a>  mean, I mean, I see this either, you know, you know, either we deny the variance and doesn't solve the problem or we approve it and doesn't solve the problem either. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=373.245s">I</a>  mean, I don't know if this is just heading to a court fight one way or the other.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=379.096s">So</a>  while others have been talking, I did look up the three permits that the assistant city engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=393.568s">And</a>  so the only listed review of the water and sewer specifically was from May of 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=409.062s">Um,</a>  there have been two engineering reviews that was approved with conditions back then. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=414.664s">There</a>  have been two engineering reviews, um, since then that have been approved with conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=422.026s">As</a>  far as I can tell, CitizenServe doesn't have super rich details about exactly what, um, those conditions are. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=430.208s">Um,</a>  my understanding, which Dennis can check me on, is that if the board were to issue <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=438.392s">uh</a>  variances on this matter that the applicant would have to pull new building permits which would trigger the need for additional engineering reviews and approvals but i'm not that's my understanding as well the other one thing which we could do is i know this was sort of prolonging this</p>

    <p>[Denis MacDougall]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=463.18s">One,</a>  I can go over this with Mike. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=465.082s">I</a>  can draft a letter to the city engineer, Owen, and basically ask him the way requests from us might actually have a little more oomph than requests from a homeowner in this instance. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=478.692s">Tell</a>  him that we kind of would like to get some settlement on this matter.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=483.716s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=485.417s">Thanks,</a>  Dennis. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=485.938s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=486.258s">So</a>  I certainly appreciate the board's take on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=490.541s">I'll</a>  just reiterate my take from last time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=493.017s">I</a>  think even if the SOAR were in good working order, which it may or may not be, I don't see a strong legal basis to grant this variance anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=505.607s">So</a>  I was prepared to vote on it last time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=508.91s">I'm</a>  extra prepared to vote on it now. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=512.553s">I'm</a>  not saying what my vote will be. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=517.017s">Maybe</a>  there's something we discuss in deliberation that sways that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=522.383s">to</a>  connect hardship stemming from configuring the house as a two-family versus a one-family to something unusual about the area and width of the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=545.464s">that</a>  presenting a hardship, like that's by itself a very hard case to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=553.25s">And</a>  then when you further consider that, at least my interpretation of the intent of the zoning ordinance, is that in a GR district, you should only be allowed by right to have a two-family if you have a bigger lot than <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=575.679s">single</a>  family and that this is already substantially undersized for a single family and the proximity to existing structures like the the potential detriment to the public good is there it seems risky the derogation from the intent of the ordinance is there it's not clear the ordinance ever intended that we should give this release relief and the <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=603.271s">The</a>  hardship case is just, in my view, basically non-existent. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=606.973s">So</a>  I'm prepared to vote, but I'll see what others would like to do, including Dennis's offer. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=622.0s">No,</a>  we're deliberating, so there's nothing to add here.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=632.045s">Mary,</a>  go ahead.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=632.985s">Yeah,</a>  so based on what was expressed with the board and also the public comments, I think I am also prepared to vote.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=647.59s">All</a>  right, so there's a couple of potential options on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=652.232s">Request</a>  to continue, have Dennis send it to the engineering department, requesting further clarification or vote tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=661.095s">Chair</a>  awaits a motion.</p>

    <p>[_Zabvvh8vxM_SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=665.176s">Could</a>  we just be able to hear from Jim and Chris a little bit?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=671.342s">I'm</a>  prepared to vote.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=673.164s">Mr.</a>  Chair, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=676.247s">Honestly,</a>  I don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=684.754s">think</a>  this, I am actually inclined to grant the variance. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=691.497s">The</a>  concern of mine is the same that I had a few minutes ago, which is that we don't have clarity on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=701.461s">And</a>  I would like the city engineer to weigh in on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=705.002s">So</a>  I'm not sure, you know, taking the pulse of everyone that's here, maybe that's a <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=715.804s">Maybe</a>  that's a waste of time, but I see this as the builder, the neighbors will be, they won't necessarily be in a substantial detriment by dividing that existing square footage. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=744.868s">so</a>  uh and the owner of the house the applicant could then keep even doing adu within the structure of the house if he were denied here so that is all staying the same in my mind um it's already there if it were not there i probably would not have voted to allow it but it's there so um <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=772.661s">That's</a>  my call. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=774.042s">I</a>  would prefer to vote on something that had more clarity in terms of what the end result will be.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=784.37s">Yeah,</a>  thanks, Chris. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=785.671s">And</a>  I would prefer to do so as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=788.753s">And</a>  we do still have the option to continue this and request more information. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=793.997s">We</a>  did provide a very specific request for information. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=798.14s">And</a>  the current info we have is no further clarity on the <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=803.031s">location</a>  of the line, miscommunication, and the position of the Assistant City Engineer is that they're not going to comment on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=812.139s">So</a>  maybe Dennis is able to clarify and that changes, but it is entirely possible we will be here a month from now in roughly the present state. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=826.112s">But</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=827.263s">We</a>  don't know that for sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=828.204s">So</a>  sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=829.485s">Go</a>  ahead, Andre.</p>

    <p>[_Zabvvh8vxM_SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=830.426s">Well,</a>  I was just going to say, I mean, it seems like a majority of the board is ready to vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=833.609s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=834.27s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=836.412s">Chair</a>  awaits a motion.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=842.919s">Motion</a>  to vote on whether.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=845.762s">So</a>  you can technically. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=848.344s">So</a>  you're supposed to motion to approve or deny. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=851.496s">You</a>  making the motion doesn't actually indicate which way you vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=855.679s">It</a>  just indicates what a yes means and a no means. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=858.421s">So</a>  as a best practice, I recommend motions to approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=862.943s">And</a>  then that way, a no means no, I don't approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=866.846s">And</a>  a yes means yes, I do approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=869.648s">But</a>  you can also do the opposite. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=871.429s">So</a>  chair awaits a motion.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=877.053s">So</a>  motion to approve.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=880.473s">Okay,</a>  so motion to approve the variances for 289 Bellesway West. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=887.335s">Do</a>  I have a second?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=894.977s">This</a>  is meaning that we don't get clarity though, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=898.158s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[_Zabvvh8vxM_SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=916.908s">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=918.388s">Mary?</a> </p>

    <p>[_Zabvvh8vxM_SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=919.368s">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=920.589s">Chris?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=921.929s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=923.189s">Jim?</a> </p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=924.129s">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=925.609s">Mike,</a>  no. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=927.51s">So</a>  four yeses were required. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=929.69s">We</a>  have one yes, four noes. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=932.931s">So</a>  the petition is denied. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=935.011s">And</a>  then we will work on a decision.</p>

    <p>[Denis MacDougall]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=941.684s">uh</a>  to record this but um but yeah the the project can't go forward as proposed so just it's next for me now so maybe jump in like yeah okay so and i'll write up a decision once it's written it'll get checked by our legal folks and then after it's signed by the members it gets uh <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=971.602s">you</a>  know, submit filed at the city clerk's office, I'll get you, I'll get you a copy of that signed version stamped by the city clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=979.407s">So</a>  at that point, there's a 20 days appeals period after.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=983.17s">And</a>  so the period would be to the land court, I believe, right then.</p>

    <p>[Denis MacDougall]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=987.293s">Yeah,</a>  it wouldn't, it doesn't get appealed to us anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=989.074s">It's</a>  out of our hands. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=989.834s">It</a>  would go to a state court at that point for if you want to appeal.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=993.977s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=995.318s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=996.219s">Thanks</a>  folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=997.56s">What's</a>  next?</p>

    <p>[Denis MacDougall]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1003.749s">100</a>  Dartmouth Street, case number 8-2025-10. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1008.412s">Appoint</a>  an owner, George Dedek, to construct a two-car garage at one zoning district within the front yard setback on Wellesley Street, which is not allowed per the City of Medford Zoning Ordinance.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1017.659s">All</a>  right, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1018.619s">And</a>  since we do have six, I'm just going to designate everyone except for me as voting in this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1025.824s">So</a>  I will chair it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1026.865s">But</a>  we will have Jim, Mary, Andre, and Chris. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1034.7s">So,</a>  do we have a representative present for the applicant?</p>

    <p>[Christopher Dedic]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1042.023s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1043.103s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1044.484s">My</a>  name is Chris Dedick and this is my father, George Dedick. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1049.045s">He'll</a>  be speaking mostly, but I might also help. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1051.906s">He's</a>  deaf, so I might have to, you know, help along the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1057.228s">But,</a>  yeah.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1057.768s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1060.009s">Well,</a>  welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1061.23s">Please</a>  go ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1062.415s">So</a>  as we understand it, you want to build a garage. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1067.686s">So</a>  can you tell us a little bit about the project?</p>

    <p>[Christopher Dedic]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1070.589s">Uh,</a>  yeah, sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1071.61s">Um,</a>  do you want to talk? <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1072.851s">You</a>  want me to talk? <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1073.531s">Go</a>  ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1074.051s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1074.151s">Yeah,</a>  I can, I can go for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1075.672s">Um,</a>  so he wants to construct, um, a two car garage in his backyard and it's a corner lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1082.917s">So</a>  basically like the side setback in a corner lot would, or would be 15 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1088.621s">Um,</a>  and he wants to make it three feet, um, to make it so the width of the garage will be 22 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1093.284s">So</a>  it's a two car garage. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1095.345s">Um,</a>  so he just needs that relief. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1097.607s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1099.109s">from</a>  15 to three. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1100.31s">And</a>  then I can pull up, if you want me to pull up the site plan, I can pull that up if you want.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1106.455s">Yeah,</a>  that sounds great.</p>

    <p>[Christopher Dedic]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1107.836s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1122.548s">Yeah,</a>  you guys can see that?</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1125.71s">Yes,</a>  we can.</p>

    <p>[Christopher Dedic]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1129.548s">Yeah,</a>  so, uh, he would need, uh, and then the backfield here is the Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1135.531s">Um,</a>  it's a Tufts field, um, in the back. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1138.693s">Um,</a>  and then one neighbor on this side. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1141.274s">Um,</a>  and then, yeah, so it was just, this would be three feet as, um, shown here. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1146.757s">And</a>  then he has the required, so he wouldn't need, um, I don't think he would need any variants there.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1152.62s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1155.621s">And</a>  so, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1158.303s">How</a>  does one access this garage? <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1160.224s">It's</a>  a little unclear to me if there's a curb cut somewhere.</p>

    <p>[Christopher Dedic]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1163.206s">Yeah,</a>  so there should be a curb cut right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1167.348s">I</a>  think it's a 20-foot curb cut.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1170.77s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Christopher Dedic]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1174.092s">On</a>  Wellesley.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1175.536s">And</a>  is there a separate curb cut on Dartmouth Street?</p>

    <p>[Christopher Dedic]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1178.698s">Yeah,</a>  so he has a garage right here, four car garage. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1184.881s">And</a>  then he has a roughly, I don't know the exact, has a roughly 20 foot curb cut about here.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1195.946s">Other</a>  questions so far from the board?</p>

    <p>[_Zabvvh8vxM_SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1205.221s">Yeah,</a>  Mr. Chair, Andre, I have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1209.664s">I'm</a>  just curious why you need another 2-car garage if you already have a 4-car garage?</p>

    <p>[Christopher Dedic]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1217.849s">Yeah,</a>  so he has a permit submitted to the city currently where he's turning this 4-car garage into a second unit. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1228.915s">So</a>  then therefore, he would lose all of his parking, basically.</p>

    <p>[_Zabvvh8vxM_SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1234.288s">Got</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1234.648s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1243.536s">And</a>  so have you discussed the extra curb cut with the city engineering department or the DBW?</p>

    <p>[Christopher Dedic]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1251.263s">The</a>  second curb cut? <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1256.696s">Have</a>  you talked to the Medford Engineering Department?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1261.244s">I</a>  think Owen, maybe? <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1264.05s">Oh</a>  yeah, I did talk to him. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1266.033s">He</a>  says, yeah, you need it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1269.961s">Chuck</a>  send that in and that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1271.382s">There</a>  was nothing done after that.</p>

    <p>[Christopher Dedic]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1273.383s">I</a>  don't know if you could hear him. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1275.304s">He</a>  said that he spoke with Owen and Owen said, of course, you need it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1279.706s">And</a>  then he my father said he went and got plans drawn up from Medford Engineering for the curb cut. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1289.965s">I'm</a>  not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1290.505s">I</a>  don't think those have been submitted for the curb cut yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1293.407s">I'm</a>  not, I'm not sure the process, how that works, um, if that was supposed to be done prior to this or post this or at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1300.151s">Um,</a>  but yeah.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1301.992s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1302.493s">So</a>  the only thing, um, that might be helpful for us to know that I can think of that you haven't already shared is I know that the, <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1318.5s">City</a>  is generally taking the position that properties with a curb cut should not get a set impact on street parking, among other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1334.668s">And</a>  so here, we don't govern the approvals for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1341.491s">It</a>  would basically imply that a second <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1345.92s">curve</a>  cuts required. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1348.824s">You're</a>  intending to convert the existing garage. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1354.752s">But</a>  yeah, am I correctly understanding you're not proposing removing the curve cut and <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1363.405s">repurposing</a>  what's currently parking? <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1365.686s">No,</a>  no.</p>

    <p>[Christopher Dedic]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1366.207s">Yeah,</a>  because there's still going to be a few parking spaces for two parking spaces for like this said unit in front of like in the driveway right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1375.592s">Got</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1376.952s">And</a>  I would like, I can just touch upon Wellesley Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1381.435s">If</a>  that part's not permitted, and it's <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1385.957s">I</a>  guess like a private road kind of where it's just like a dirt side with the fence. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1392.921s">So</a>  there's technically not supposed to be parking there anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1397.643s">That's</a>  not like a curb sidewalk that you're allowed to park on. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1401.045s">I</a>  see. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1404.627s">If</a>  you guys, I'm not sure if you're familiar with that area.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1407.128s">I</a>  think people get it because it doesn't have a designated curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1411.47s">It's</a>  still a side of the street that's parking available. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1417.658s">I</a>  would argue, though, that you're moving more people into this building. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1421.239s">And</a>  so you would essentially already be bringing cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1425.101s">So</a>  you would be taking up those spots that currently exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1429.163s">And</a>  so you're bringing them in. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1431.324s">So</a>  it would be one for one. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1432.825s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1433.125s">I</a>  would say you're not you're still not losing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1436.407s">But</a>  I wouldn't say straight out that you're you're going to that that's not parking because that's not right either.</p>

    <p>[Christopher Dedic]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1446.26s">Yeah,</a>  no, I mean, I'm not saying it's like not parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1449.763s">It's</a>  just not like, I guess, like the atypical what you would think of. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1453.426s">And</a>  I don't know how the city like deems it as like a private way, but they don't like repair that road for some reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1459.31s">I'm</a>  not, I'm not gonna get into that part. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1461.492s">But</a>  yeah.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1463.794s">Yeah,</a>  so it's, it's a bit complicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1468.097s">I</a>  mean, if we need to go down the rabbit hole, we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1470.139s">But</a>  I think the short version of it is my understanding is that even as a private <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1476.4s">way</a>  the public can and does park along Wellesley Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1484.027s">But</a>  yeah, Yvette, to your point, it's the reconfiguration of the house does on average imply adding cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1492.994s">So</a>  I think that's a fair point. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1498.338s">Okay,</a>  other questions from members of the board?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1504.251s">I</a>  would ask just about that curb cut or the paveway leading onto the street to the applicant's point that that side of the street is a little more less kept. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1518.515s">Is</a>  there going to be a driveway that leads all the way to the street that will be cleaning up all that stuff or is it still going to be a dirt path?</p>

    <p>[Christopher Dedic]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1524.697s">He</a>  would pave from his property to the garage door or whatever all the way up until the asphalted street. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1535.21s">So</a>  then where does trash go?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1538.613s">I</a>  feel like I'm always asking the trash question. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1541.875s">So</a>  if you now have two spaces, where did it go?</p>

    <p>[Christopher Dedic]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1545.277s">And</a>  now where does it go? <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1548.74s">Along</a>  the side of his fence over here, he has his two barrels for his current single family. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1553.263s">So</a>  he would just put the four barrels total, <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1556.965s">two-track,</a>  two-recycling in the same spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1560.026s">Him</a>  himself would come down the stairs in the exact same way that he does it now, and then the new tenant's front door is going to be here as well, and then they would also just come right over to the side by the fence.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1574.472s">It</a>  still gets picked up in front of Dartmouth, not the other side of the street.</p>

    <p>[Christopher Dedic]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1578.654s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1579.814s">The</a>  property address is 100 Dartmouth, and then the front door for both units will be on 100 Dartmouth. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1589.375s">And</a>  then the way he's planning on using the garage, this is gonna be solely, like this is his back door and it's gonna stay. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1597.439s">And</a>  then he's gonna, him and my mother are gonna use this garage. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1602.141s">And</a>  then basically like, they'll just go from the garage into the back door. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1605.482s">And</a>  then the new other unit that's gonna be like on the right would just have like the driveway spots.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1615.206s">So</a>  this is that is gonna benefit <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1617.896s">the</a>  owner to make it easier for them to get in and out, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1622.048s">Because</a>  that is someone who needs maybe</p>

    <p>[Christopher Dedic]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1626.863s">closer</a>  spot right instead of doing like a handicap spot or something or in the future that might be needed right we need to like think about that exactly you know my parents they're senior citizens so of course they you know the closer to the you know this is only I think four stairs maybe in the front is whatever seven or something so it's less stairs to get into the house for them as well so it is beneficial for them and then I <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1656.449s">It</a>  retains that their second unit or the other apartment that they're trying to build would also get two parking spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1664.85s">So</a>  each tenant, therefore, would have two parking spaces.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1675.472s">Mary,</a>  go ahead.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1676.333s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1677.273s">Do</a>  you mind pulling up the Google view for this? <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1680.513s">Is</a>  it a red house?</p>

    <p>[Christopher Dedic]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1683.274s">Yeah,</a>  like reddish wood.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1687.149s">Yeah,</a>  I don't see I don't see where the proposed garage is. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1691.793s">I</a>  always see just one side of the house.</p>

    <p>[Christopher Dedic]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1694.115s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1698.519s">So</a>  this is their house right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1703.263s">So</a>  the garage would be right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1705.785s">So</a>  three feet away from the Tufts field and 10 feet away from their like backyard or the back of their house. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1717.133s">And</a>  then did you want the street view?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1719.634s">Yes,</a>  please.</p>

    <p>[Christopher Dedic]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1720.494s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1725.136s">So</a>  this is the back of their house or so wrong way. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1735.439s">So</a>  it's kind of hard to say but yeah, three. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1738.34s">Sorry</a>  about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1745.182s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1746.535s">Yeah,</a>  so 3 feet from this fence and then 10 feet from like this house. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1750.777s">So</a>  it would basically be like, kind of where that like, what fence structure is right? <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1756.08s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1757.1s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1757.64s">And</a>  then as you can, like, of course, the people use this, but. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1761.562s">Yeah,</a>  take it for what it's worth, I suppose.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1768.746s">Right</a>  other questions from the board.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1779.88s">All</a>  right, so before we open for public comment, I just want to describe the process the board has to follow for the requested relief. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1792.51s">So</a>  because this is too close in the side yard, I think that if I'm <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1803.522s">understanding</a>  correctly, because it's next to this field at Tufts, the backyard isn't triggered, but certainly the side yard is too close. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1812.469s">So</a>  the board would have to establish that due to circumstances pertaining to the shape, topography or soil conditions of a lot of structures that aren't generated, <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1828.082s">It</a>  would create a hardship if we literally enforced the zoning ordinance and didn't grant the requested relief. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1833.544s">So</a>  the structures are positioned on the lot such that there's no eligible forming and logical location to place a garage. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1848.468s">That</a>  would be one example of a situation where the board might decide that that's unusual circumstances. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1857.666s">that</a>  create a hardship. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1858.867s">So</a>  yeah, if you do have any argument you'd like to make about the hardship that would be imposed if the board didn't really enforce the zoning ordinance, now would be a good time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1873.46s">So</a>  what would happen if you didn't get the relief? <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1875.501s">Could</a>  you place a garage anywhere?</p>

    <p>[Christopher Dedic]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1878.158s">Um,</a>  so we wouldn't be able to place a garage anywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1881.439s">And</a>  then therefore that he wouldn't meet the parking requirements for his second unit either. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1887.28s">So</a>  he wouldn't meet that hardship of not being able to convert as well, when the time comes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1894.162s">Got</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1894.882s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1895.602s">So</a>  just so I'm clear the plans before us, this is a single family, and you're proposing <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1904.863s">a</a>  garage in this location.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1906.363s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1907.484s">But</a>  the intention is that eventually you do a conversion.</p>

    <p>[Christopher Dedic]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1910.965s">So</a>  that's yeah, that those plans have already been submitted and are working their way through approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1917.547s">Got</a>  it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1918.107s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1921.328s">Other</a>  questions from the board? <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1926.69s">I'm</a>  going to open it up to public comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1928.77s">If</a>  you're a member of the public and would like to speak on this matter, you may do so now. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1933.832s">You</a>  can <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1936.537s">raise</a>  your hand on Zoom, turn on your camera, raise your hand, type something in the chat, or you can email Dennis, dmcdougal at medford-ma.gov.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1957.233s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1957.734s">I'm</a>  not seeing any members of the public who would like to speak on this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1963.173s">So</a>  the chair awaits a motion to close the public portion of the hearing and motion to close the public portion of the hearing and debate. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1971.3s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1972.1s">Do</a>  I have a second?</p>

    <p>[_Zabvvh8vxM_SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1995.008s">100.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=1995.068s">I</a>  think that they have enough square footage to put a second unit in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2001.43s">I</a>  think that this garage would be the only location to put it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2008.533s">It</a>  would be, I think, a hardship to try to locate parking on the site in any other location. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2014.016s">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2017.397s">Thank</a>  you, Andre. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2018.197s">Other</a>  thoughts from the board?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2029.622s">Mr.</a>  Chair, I also agree if they're going to have parking requirements for the second year, and they obviously have to put it somewhere on the property and I'm inclined to approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2045.335s">Sad</a>  to see that garden go though.</p>

    <p>[Christopher Dedic]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2047.897s">Oh,</a>  they'll still have a plenty big enough garden.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2053.343s">All</a>  right, Yvette, it looked like you were going to say something as well.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2057.046s">I</a>  was just going to add that I actually think it would be a detriment to the neighbors because then, again, there might be a hardship for parking, to find the parking for owners themselves, I think, besides it being a burden to move. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2075.583s">You'd</a>  lose a lot more of the yard if you had to put it elsewhere on the lots where it would go. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2081.687s">And</a>  also for the door, for the owners themselves, I think it's an improvement for their lives as well as, again, the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2090.409s">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Denis MacDougall]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2145.112s">So,</a>  Jordan, Chris. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2146.553s">So</a>  I'll write up the decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2147.834s">It'll</a>  get reviewed by our legal counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2150.756s">And</a>  then it'll come back to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2152.538s">I'll</a>  send it off to the board for signatures. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2154.159s">Once</a>  we get the signatures, I'll file it in the clerk's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2158.122s">And</a>  at that point, so that's probably still a few weeks away from now, at that point, there's a 20 days appeals period. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2165.493s">And</a>  once those 20 days are done, then you can go and get your permit.</p>

    <p>[Christopher Dedic]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2170.156s">Okay,</a>  perfect.</p>

    <p>[Denis MacDougall]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2170.777s">So</a>  the time from now to getting the permit is probably about a month and a half away or so give or take give or take, you know, schedule something so much.</p>

    <p>[Christopher Dedic]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2177.782s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2178.082s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2178.362s">And</a>  I said we had a follow up question about the curb cut. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2182.005s">So</a>  that's not through here that way he would just go to the engineering department and apply for it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2188.489s">Yeah,</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2189.65s">So</a>  the issue a permit for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2191.771s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2194.142s">Like</a>  I said, my understanding is they're not general fans of the double curb cut. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2199.767s">And</a>  for a lot of the buy right stuff, they're denying it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2202.569s">But</a>  I also understand that they tend to be reluctant to deny permits in cases where the zoning board approved something because it would basically kill the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2214.278s">So</a>  ultimately, that's for them to decide. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2216.24s">And</a>  we can't condition our decision on that.</p>

    <p>[Christopher Dedic]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2219.743s">All</a>  right, perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2220.784s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2221.224s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2221.784s">Appreciate</a>  your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2224.578s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2245.104s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2245.664s">Um,</a>  thanks. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2246.485s">And</a>  Dennis, just before we get started, I want to double check, um, the requested relief here. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2252.009s">So</a>  this is a request for a special permit for an accessory use. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2257.373s">Is</a>  that right?</p>

    <p>[Denis MacDougall]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2259.735s">That's</a>  the way I, that's the way we sort of, we just, let me just give me one half second to call up the technical serve to see if there's any extra comments on it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2271.403s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2271.663s">Well,</a>  while you're doing that, Dennis, we can, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2274.818s">we</a>  can let the applicant get started. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2277.721s">So</a>  I see we have a Russell Robar on the call. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2282.825s">Are</a>  you here to speak on this matter, Russell?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2290.633s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2290.953s">Hi</a>  everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2291.534s">Thanks</a>  for your time.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2292.234s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2293.756s">Good</a>  evening.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2295.837s">I've</a>  been a licensed massage therapist for over 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2300.618s">And</a>  I primarily work downtown, but my wife and I, we do have a guest bedroom in our house and I work on my family. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2312.629s">And</a>  I have a lot of clients that come in from outside of the city, convenient for them to just drive in. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2321.697s">We</a>  have two parking, guest parking permits and park in front of the house and come up <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2328.472s">I</a>  still need to get a solo establishment license from the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2334.757s">So</a>  they still will come in and look at the room and make sure that it is passes their criteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2345.245s">But</a>  the first thing that I need is a business license. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2348.447s">And</a>  that's why I'm here.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2350.989s">Okay,</a>  got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2351.93s">And</a>  so am I correctly understanding that <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2356.229s">you</a>  would need the board to grant this special permit for the accessory use to get that business license, and then you'd need that to bring to the state?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2368.515s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2369.015s">I</a>  have to then apply for solo establishment license to the state, and then they send an inspector to inspect the location, the room, to make sure that it passes their criteria, so that then I can get a solo establishment license. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2384.751s">So</a>  it still has to be passed by the state as well.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2391.613s">And</a>  so the board may have some questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2396.115s">Oh,</a>  by the way, I'm going to act as last time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2398.235s">So</a>  everyone except for me is voting. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2403.357s">So</a>  for accessory uses, or sorry, from home occupations, <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2413.403s">Um,</a>  there's some that are allowed as a right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2416.324s">There's</a>  some that require a special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2418.904s">My</a>  understanding is that this one does require a special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2423.165s">And</a>  so, um, the requirements are that the home occupation be conducted solely within, uh, the dwelling by the person's occupying that dwelling as a primary residence, that, uh, the use is incidental. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2444.689s">to</a>  the property, so it's primarily a residential property and this is secondary use, that the use doesn't produce offensive noise, vibration, smoke, dust, odors, heat, lighting, electrical interference, radioactive pollution, that there's no regular sale of wares of goods on the premise, that it does not utilize exterior storage of material or equipment, <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2472.178s">and</a>  that there's no more than two non-resident employees, that there's no exterior indication of the presence other than a sign or nameplate in compliance with the sign ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2495.499s">And</a>  so if all of those conditions are met, <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2499.018s">then</a>  the Board of Appeals can grant a special permit subject to conditions including but not limited to restricting the hours of operation, the maximum floor area, the off-street parking, and the maximum number of daily customer or other vehicle trips. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2515.63s">And</a>  that permit terminates with transfer of ownership of the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2521.515s">So,</a>  just wanted the Board to have that context.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2526.352s">So</a>  I'll just have probably six clients a day, one an hour, so six cars a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2534.277s">And</a>  like I said, we have guest permit parking out front. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2537.959s">So</a>  it's not really going to affect the street at all.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2543.562s">And</a>  so do you already know what your intended hours of operation are?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2549.525s">Typically,</a>  I'm like 10 to 6. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2551.126s">So</a>  10 to 6?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2552.967s">10</a>  AM to 6 PM. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2556.319s">And</a>  is this, uh, on a, is, is the day of the week already one?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2560.681s">On</a>  a Monday. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2562.402s">I</a>  work during the week. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2563.743s">I</a>  don't work on the weekends.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2565.544s">I</a>  see. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2566.444s">So</a>  Mondays end to six. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2569.686s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2570.786s">Um,</a>  one customer per hour.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2575.048s">Approximately.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2575.809s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2576.209s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2576.789s">So</a>  you anticipate, uh, roughly six, um, maybe more on some days, but, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2586.64s">you'd</a>  be working for the eight hours, 10 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2589.101s">to</a>  6 p.m.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2590.281s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2591.441s">I'd</a>  say not more than like eight people, but again, it's, I can only work on one person at a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2597.102s">So</a>  one person will show up and one person will leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2599.283s">So,</a>  and we have two guest parking permits. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2603.404s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2605.504s">My</a>  wife and I have a driveway, so our cars are in the driveway.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2608.945s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2611.566s">Um,</a>  questions from the board.</p>

    <p>[_Zabvvh8vxM_SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2619.358s">Andre.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2621.62s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2623.522s">Do</a>  you have a waiting area?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2625.063s">Typically,</a>  what I'm going to do is just have them wait in the car, because I need to bring out the guest permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2635.633s">I'll</a>  have them wait in the car, go out, give them the permit, walk them into the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2641.839s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2643.6s">Other</a>  questions from the board?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2647.151s">Would</a>  there ever be a time where you would just leave your cars on the street and let the guests park in the driveway?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2661.103s">I</a>  don't see that happening because we have the guest permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2664.346s">So</a>  they would just, it's actually easier for them because we're the main entrance to the door. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2674.987s">Guest</a>  bedrooms up the flight of stairs that are closest to the main entrance, and they just come in and walk up the stairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2681.652s">And</a>  literally, you walk across the hall into the guest bedroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2684.575s">So</a>  it's actually easier from the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2687.998s">I</a>  mean, we could do that, but I don't think that would happen.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2691.841s">And</a>  how do you anticipate handling a snow emergency?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2703.581s">No</a>  one would come. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2705.522s">You</a>  just, things happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2707.683s">If</a>  it's a snow emergency, I wouldn't want my clients to come on a day like that and have them obstruct the plowing.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2716.95s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2722.854s">Chris?</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2725.015s">Yeah,</a>  Mr. Chair, I just was wondering, do the <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2732.262s">parking</a>  permits allow people to use it all day. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2736.687s">I</a>  can't remember. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2737.529s">There's</a>  some limit to how they're</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2747.724s">I'm</a>  not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2748.185s">Do</a>  you want me to just run and get it? <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2749.306s">I</a>  can read it to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2751.048s">No,</a>  I'm for your own benefit.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kCdGHg1OaMo&t=2755.732s">I</a>  would just check with the parking office to make sure that you can do that versus what Yvette just said, which is maybe a little.</p>
