1
00:00:00,142 --> 00:00:00,883
[SPEAKER_05]: comment on this.

2
00:00:01,643 --> 00:00:12,273
[SPEAKER_05]: So my concern is that we're creating a situation that could be made worse.

3
00:00:14,155 --> 00:00:16,477
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I need to double check.

4
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:23,423
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't recall the status of whether there's already a permit issued for the sewer.

5
00:00:24,523 --> 00:00:26,764
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know the building commissioners on vacation.

6
00:00:26,864 --> 00:00:33,687
[SPEAKER_09]: Dennis, do you happen to know, even if there is a permit issued, if this would trigger the need for a new permit?

7
00:00:38,089 --> 00:00:38,669
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me look it up.

8
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:39,910
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

9
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:44,852
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they'll look up the current status of the permit.

10
00:00:45,954 --> 00:00:48,075
[SPEAKER_09]: the permit as well.

11
00:00:48,656 --> 00:00:59,763
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Chair, I think the question that I raised at the last meeting was about the sewer lines.

12
00:01:00,764 --> 00:01:05,547
[SPEAKER_11]: One question was about the quality of the line, which the video seek to answer.

13
00:01:06,347 --> 00:01:09,870
[SPEAKER_11]: But the other question is simply, where does the sewer line run?

14
00:01:10,665 --> 00:01:15,806
[SPEAKER_11]: And that seems to be something that the city engineer should weigh in on.

15
00:01:16,466 --> 00:01:36,410
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't understand, I haven't seen this back and forth with the emails and what the city engineer basically declined to answer saying that it was a matter between two, but how can we as a board, I mean, we need to see where the utilities run and to be able to evaluate whether there's a detriment to

16
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:42,472
[SPEAKER_11]: the neighborhood, you know, if there's one that's in poor condition.

17
00:01:45,654 --> 00:01:50,716
[SPEAKER_09]: Dennis, maybe, could you reread the specific wording from the city engineer?

18
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:57,619
[SPEAKER_18]: I just want to make sure the... I can, but I just forwarded it to you as well, so it's in your QK.

19
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,381
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have it yet.

20
00:02:03,502 --> 00:02:03,982
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, here we go.

21
00:02:06,065 --> 00:02:24,862
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, so I don't see the original message, but the first response we see says, hi, Edmund, the engineering division will not comment regarding private property matters.

22
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:35,445
[SPEAKER_09]: My previous email was relative to the overall building permit condition set forth by engineering water source stated on permits, some numbers.

23
00:02:36,706 --> 00:02:52,319
[SPEAKER_09]: And then in some of the back and forth, the assistant city engineer

24
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,721
[SPEAKER_09]: mentions that the permits themselves can be viewed on CitizenServe.

25
00:02:56,781 --> 00:03:00,902
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm looking for those now.

26
00:03:00,922 --> 00:03:03,123
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have numbers for the permits.

27
00:03:05,904 --> 00:03:09,725
[SPEAKER_11]: If I could ask a question in the meantime to Ed.

28
00:03:11,585 --> 00:03:20,128
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just wondering, Ed, your best understanding is that your sewer line connects to Fern Road?

29
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:28,394
[SPEAKER_16]: I know 100% for a fact the sewer line connects from my property into their property into Fern Road.

30
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:36,479
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a 100% video, you guys can do a site visit, I can show you the exact mark for it, for the water and the sewer.

31
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:43,524
[SPEAKER_16]: And the gas line was already got removed from National Grid because it's a regular reasonable price to remove it.

32
00:03:43,884 --> 00:03:48,430
[SPEAKER_16]: It costs a reasonable price to remove, but the estimates that I got in the store, they're outrageous.

33
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,532
[SPEAKER_16]: Like you're looking between $30,000 to $40,000 to get it removed and replaced.

34
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:59,265
[SPEAKER_16]: When I had a conversation with them, I was off the line.

35
00:03:59,285 --> 00:04:03,269
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to ask a question about the fact I don't want to get back into that discussion.

36
00:04:03,289 --> 00:04:04,090
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to.

37
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:08,895
[SPEAKER_11]: So you're because your video, it was longer than the other one.

38
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:13,119
[SPEAKER_11]: It's that's does it almost seem to me it was very straight and long.

39
00:04:13,279 --> 00:04:15,621
[SPEAKER_11]: And are you sure it doesn't connect into the film?

40
00:04:16,543 --> 00:04:18,124
[SPEAKER_16]: It does not connect to the Felsway.

41
00:04:18,865 --> 00:04:19,986
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm 100% sure.

42
00:04:20,766 --> 00:04:21,967
[SPEAKER_16]: It goes from my house.

43
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:26,571
[SPEAKER_16]: I have it marked on my site and I got it marked from Fern Road.

44
00:04:27,011 --> 00:04:37,840
[SPEAKER_16]: At first, we thought it connects from their house into my house and connects together and go down along the wall of the gas station into the Felsway.

45
00:04:38,501 --> 00:04:40,642
[SPEAKER_16]: And we were under oppression, that's where the line is.

46
00:04:41,082 --> 00:04:51,848
[SPEAKER_16]: And the first attempt of recording that line, by request from Emmett, went to a place where it's completely dry, hadn't been used in years.

47
00:04:52,649 --> 00:04:59,713
[SPEAKER_16]: So I dug out that side of the pipe, supposedly end, and realized it comes to the wall behind the gas station.

48
00:05:00,893 --> 00:05:01,514
[SPEAKER_16]: So I end up...

49
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:08,537
[SPEAKER_16]: dragging out a little bit more before it used to be a front yard, and the sewer line was Nick.

50
00:05:09,118 --> 00:05:14,844
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's when we realized it goes from my house into their house in Deferred Road.

51
00:05:15,264 --> 00:05:23,133
[SPEAKER_16]: And the reason I thought they're connected together, because Rob was under the impression that our line and his line are connected together.

52
00:05:23,553 --> 00:05:28,914
[SPEAKER_16]: Based on their video today, I'm going to assume that they have a separate line than mine.

53
00:05:29,234 --> 00:05:34,655
[SPEAKER_16]: We can't, there is no way we are connected together because that's the sewer line.

54
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:39,036
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm like a million percent sure it goes from Fern Road into my house.

55
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:43,217
[SPEAKER_16]: And their video, it's got to be for a separate line that goes from their house.

56
00:05:45,577 --> 00:05:46,117
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, thank you.

57
00:05:47,017 --> 00:05:47,357
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

58
00:05:47,617 --> 00:05:50,558
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I just, this is kind of why I feel like

59
00:05:51,777 --> 00:05:57,159
[SPEAKER_11]: need the city engineer to kind of tell us where the utility is.

60
00:05:57,699 --> 00:06:13,185
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I mean, I see this either, you know, you know, either we deny the variance and doesn't solve the problem or we approve it and doesn't solve the problem either.

61
00:06:13,245 --> 00:06:16,406
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I don't know if this is just heading to a court fight one way or the other.

62
00:06:19,096 --> 00:06:33,008
[SPEAKER_09]: So while others have been talking, I did look up the three permits that the assistant city engineer.

63
00:06:33,568 --> 00:06:43,837
[SPEAKER_09]: And so the only listed review of the water and sewer specifically was from May of 2023.

64
00:06:49,062 --> 00:06:54,023
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, there have been two engineering reviews that was approved with conditions back then.

65
00:06:54,664 --> 00:07:00,905
[SPEAKER_09]: There have been two engineering reviews, um, since then that have been approved with conditions.

66
00:07:02,026 --> 00:07:10,188
[SPEAKER_09]: As far as I can tell, CitizenServe doesn't have super rich details about exactly what, um, those conditions are.

67
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:16,970
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, my understanding, which Dennis can check me on, is that if the board were to issue

68
00:07:18,392 --> 00:07:41,900
[SPEAKER_09]: uh variances on this matter that the applicant would have to pull new building permits which would trigger the need for additional engineering reviews and approvals but i'm not that's my understanding as well the other one thing which we could do is i know this was sort of prolonging this

69
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,982
[SPEAKER_18]: One, I can go over this with Mike.

70
00:07:45,082 --> 00:07:58,212
[SPEAKER_18]: I can draft a letter to the city engineer, Owen, and basically ask him the way requests from us might actually have a little more oomph than requests from a homeowner in this instance.

71
00:07:58,692 --> 00:08:03,696
[SPEAKER_18]: Tell him that we kind of would like to get some settlement on this matter.

72
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:05,357
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

73
00:08:05,417 --> 00:08:05,918
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks, Dennis.

74
00:08:05,938 --> 00:08:06,218
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

75
00:08:06,258 --> 00:08:10,021
[SPEAKER_09]: So I certainly appreciate the board's take on that.

76
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:12,423
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll just reiterate my take from last time.

77
00:08:13,017 --> 00:08:25,347
[SPEAKER_09]: I think even if the SOAR were in good working order, which it may or may not be, I don't see a strong legal basis to grant this variance anyway.

78
00:08:25,607 --> 00:08:28,890
[SPEAKER_09]: So I was prepared to vote on it last time.

79
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:31,192
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm extra prepared to vote on it now.

80
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:36,917
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not saying what my vote will be.

81
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:40,660
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe there's something we discuss in deliberation that sways that.

82
00:08:42,383 --> 00:09:02,335
[SPEAKER_09]: to connect hardship stemming from configuring the house as a two-family versus a one-family to something unusual about the area and width of the property.

83
00:09:05,464 --> 00:09:12,489
[SPEAKER_09]: that presenting a hardship, like that's by itself a very hard case to make.

84
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:33,667
[SPEAKER_09]: And then when you further consider that, at least my interpretation of the intent of the zoning ordinance, is that in a GR district, you should only be allowed by right to have a two-family if you have a bigger lot than

85
00:09:35,679 --> 00:10:02,493
[SPEAKER_09]: single family and that this is already substantially undersized for a single family and the proximity to existing structures like the the potential detriment to the public good is there it seems risky the derogation from the intent of the ordinance is there it's not clear the ordinance ever intended that we should give this release relief and the

86
00:10:03,271 --> 00:10:06,893
[SPEAKER_09]: The hardship case is just, in my view, basically non-existent.

87
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:18,158
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm prepared to vote, but I'll see what others would like to do, including Dennis's offer.

88
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,881
[SPEAKER_09]: No, we're deliberating, so there's nothing to add here.

89
00:10:32,045 --> 00:10:32,565
[SPEAKER_10]: Mary, go ahead.

90
00:10:32,985 --> 00:10:41,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so based on what was expressed with the board and also the public comments, I think I am also prepared to vote.

91
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:50,591
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, so there's a couple of potential options on the table.

92
00:10:52,232 --> 00:11:00,474
[SPEAKER_09]: Request to continue, have Dennis send it to the engineering department, requesting further clarification or vote tonight.

93
00:11:01,095 --> 00:11:01,975
[SPEAKER_09]: Chair awaits a motion.

94
00:11:05,176 --> 00:11:09,480
[SPEAKER_11]: Could we just be able to hear from Jim and Chris a little bit?

95
00:11:11,342 --> 00:11:13,144
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm prepared to vote.

96
00:11:13,164 --> 00:11:16,227
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Chair, I don't know.

97
00:11:16,247 --> 00:11:17,969
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, I don't.

98
00:11:24,754 --> 00:11:30,756
[SPEAKER_05]: think this, I am actually inclined to grant the variance.

99
00:11:31,497 --> 00:11:40,621
[SPEAKER_05]: The concern of mine is the same that I had a few minutes ago, which is that we don't have clarity on this.

100
00:11:41,461 --> 00:11:44,902
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would like the city engineer to weigh in on it.

101
00:11:45,002 --> 00:11:53,586
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm not sure, you know, taking the pulse of everyone that's here, maybe that's a

102
00:11:55,804 --> 00:12:23,710
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe that's a waste of time, but I see this as the builder, the neighbors will be, they won't necessarily be in a substantial detriment by dividing that existing square footage.

103
00:12:24,868 --> 00:12:51,402
[SPEAKER_05]: so uh and the owner of the house the applicant could then keep even doing adu within the structure of the house if he were denied here so that is all staying the same in my mind um it's already there if it were not there i probably would not have voted to allow it but it's there so um

104
00:12:52,661 --> 00:12:53,682
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my call.

105
00:12:54,042 --> 00:13:02,909
[SPEAKER_05]: I would prefer to vote on something that had more clarity in terms of what the end result will be.

106
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:05,250
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, thanks, Chris.

107
00:13:05,671 --> 00:13:08,353
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would prefer to do so as well.

108
00:13:08,753 --> 00:13:13,036
[SPEAKER_09]: And we do still have the option to continue this and request more information.

109
00:13:13,997 --> 00:13:18,120
[SPEAKER_09]: We did provide a very specific request for information.

110
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:22,283
[SPEAKER_09]: And the current info we have is no further clarity on the

111
00:13:23,031 --> 00:13:32,059
[SPEAKER_09]: location of the line, miscommunication, and the position of the Assistant City Engineer is that they're not going to comment on it.

112
00:13:32,139 --> 00:13:44,610
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe Dennis is able to clarify and that changes, but it is entirely possible we will be here a month from now in roughly the present state.

113
00:13:46,112 --> 00:13:46,252
[SPEAKER_09]: But

114
00:13:47,263 --> 00:13:48,164
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't know that for sure.

115
00:13:48,204 --> 00:13:49,425
[SPEAKER_09]: So sure.

116
00:13:49,485 --> 00:13:50,206
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead, Andre.

117
00:13:50,426 --> 00:13:53,549
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I was just going to say, I mean, it seems like a majority of the board is ready to vote.

118
00:13:53,609 --> 00:13:53,910
[SPEAKER_11]: So.

119
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:56,372
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

120
00:13:56,412 --> 00:13:57,533
[SPEAKER_11]: Chair awaits a motion.

121
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:05,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to vote on whether.

122
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:07,544
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can technically.

123
00:14:08,344 --> 00:14:10,807
[SPEAKER_09]: So you're supposed to motion to approve or deny.

124
00:14:11,496 --> 00:14:15,579
[SPEAKER_09]: You making the motion doesn't actually indicate which way you vote.

125
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:18,340
[SPEAKER_09]: It just indicates what a yes means and a no means.

126
00:14:18,421 --> 00:14:21,983
[SPEAKER_09]: So as a best practice, I recommend motions to approve.

127
00:14:22,943 --> 00:14:26,626
[SPEAKER_09]: And then that way, a no means no, I don't approve.

128
00:14:26,846 --> 00:14:28,347
[SPEAKER_09]: And a yes means yes, I do approve.

129
00:14:29,648 --> 00:14:31,349
[SPEAKER_09]: But you can also do the opposite.

130
00:14:31,429 --> 00:14:33,450
[SPEAKER_09]: So chair awaits a motion.

131
00:14:37,053 --> 00:14:38,934
[SPEAKER_04]: So motion to approve.

132
00:14:40,473 --> 00:14:47,275
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so motion to approve the variances for 289 Bellesway West.

133
00:14:47,335 --> 00:14:47,975
[SPEAKER_09]: Do I have a second?

134
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:58,118
[SPEAKER_05]: This is meaning that we don't get clarity though, right?

135
00:14:58,158 --> 00:14:58,519
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.

136
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,540
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll second.

137
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,661
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're going to take a vote.

138
00:15:09,562 --> 00:15:09,822
[SPEAKER_09]: Andre?

139
00:15:10,967 --> 00:15:15,228
[SPEAKER_09]: So just to clarify, yes is no is denied.

140
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:16,248
[SPEAKER_09]: Andre?

141
00:15:16,908 --> 00:15:17,088
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

142
00:15:18,388 --> 00:15:18,748
[SPEAKER_09]: Mary?

143
00:15:19,368 --> 00:15:19,608
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

144
00:15:20,589 --> 00:15:20,909
[SPEAKER_09]: Chris?

145
00:15:21,929 --> 00:15:22,229
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

146
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:23,489
[SPEAKER_09]: Jim?

147
00:15:24,129 --> 00:15:24,349
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

148
00:15:25,609 --> 00:15:26,230
[SPEAKER_09]: Mike, no.

149
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,270
[SPEAKER_09]: So four yeses were required.

150
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:31,490
[SPEAKER_09]: We have one yes, four noes.

151
00:15:32,931 --> 00:15:34,991
[SPEAKER_09]: So the petition is denied.

152
00:15:35,011 --> 00:15:39,732
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we will work on a decision.

153
00:15:41,684 --> 00:16:09,978
[SPEAKER_18]: uh to record this but um but yeah the the project can't go forward as proposed so just it's next for me now so maybe jump in like yeah okay so and i'll write up a decision once it's written it'll get checked by our legal folks and then after it's signed by the members it gets uh

154
00:16:11,602 --> 00:16:19,387
[SPEAKER_18]: you know, submit filed at the city clerk's office, I'll get you, I'll get you a copy of that signed version stamped by the city clerk.

155
00:16:19,407 --> 00:16:21,849
[SPEAKER_18]: So at that point, there's a 20 days appeals period after.

156
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:26,592
[SPEAKER_09]: And so the period would be to the land court, I believe, right then.

157
00:16:27,293 --> 00:16:29,054
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, it wouldn't, it doesn't get appealed to us anymore.

158
00:16:29,074 --> 00:16:29,754
[SPEAKER_18]: It's out of our hands.

159
00:16:29,834 --> 00:16:32,817
[SPEAKER_18]: It would go to a state court at that point for if you want to appeal.

160
00:16:33,977 --> 00:16:34,338
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

161
00:16:35,318 --> 00:16:35,899
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

162
00:16:36,219 --> 00:16:36,659
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks folks.

163
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:37,900
[SPEAKER_10]: What's next?

164
00:16:43,749 --> 00:16:48,252
[SPEAKER_18]: 100 Dartmouth Street, case number 8-2025-10.

165
00:16:48,412 --> 00:16:56,498
[SPEAKER_18]: Appoint an owner, George Dedek, to construct a two-car garage at one zoning district within the front yard setback on Wellesley Street, which is not allowed per the City of Medford Zoning Ordinance.

166
00:16:57,659 --> 00:16:58,399
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, thank you.

167
00:16:58,619 --> 00:17:05,744
[SPEAKER_09]: And since we do have six, I'm just going to designate everyone except for me as voting in this matter.

168
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:06,765
[SPEAKER_09]: So I will chair it.

169
00:17:06,865 --> 00:17:09,567
[SPEAKER_09]: But we will have Jim, Mary, Andre, and Chris.

170
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:19,302
[SPEAKER_09]: So, do we have a representative present for the applicant?

171
00:17:22,023 --> 00:17:23,083
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

172
00:17:23,103 --> 00:17:23,743
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi.

173
00:17:24,484 --> 00:17:27,565
[SPEAKER_20]: My name is Chris Dedick and this is my father, George Dedick.

174
00:17:29,045 --> 00:17:31,866
[SPEAKER_20]: He'll be speaking mostly, but I might also help.

175
00:17:31,906 --> 00:17:36,788
[SPEAKER_20]: He's deaf, so I might have to, you know, help along the way.

176
00:17:37,228 --> 00:17:37,628
[SPEAKER_20]: But, yeah.

177
00:17:37,768 --> 00:17:39,889
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

178
00:17:40,009 --> 00:17:40,589
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, welcome.

179
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:41,950
[SPEAKER_09]: Please go ahead.

180
00:17:42,415 --> 00:17:47,666
[SPEAKER_09]: So as we understand it, you want to build a garage.

181
00:17:47,686 --> 00:17:49,610
[SPEAKER_09]: So can you tell us a little bit about the project?

182
00:17:50,589 --> 00:17:51,230
[SPEAKER_20]: Uh, yeah, sure.

183
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:52,831
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, do you want to talk?

184
00:17:52,851 --> 00:17:53,411
[SPEAKER_20]: You want me to talk?

185
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:54,031
[SPEAKER_20]: Go ahead.

186
00:17:54,051 --> 00:17:54,131
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

187
00:17:54,151 --> 00:17:55,432
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I can, I can go for it.

188
00:17:55,672 --> 00:18:02,537
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, so he wants to construct, um, a two car garage in his backyard and it's a corner lot.

189
00:18:02,917 --> 00:18:08,080
[SPEAKER_20]: So basically like the side setback in a corner lot would, or would be 15 feet.

190
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:13,204
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, and he wants to make it three feet, um, to make it so the width of the garage will be 22 feet.

191
00:18:13,284 --> 00:18:14,345
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's a two car garage.

192
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:16,966
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, so he just needs that relief.

193
00:18:17,607 --> 00:18:17,727
[SPEAKER_20]: Um,

194
00:18:19,109 --> 00:18:20,290
[SPEAKER_20]: from 15 to three.

195
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:26,075
[SPEAKER_20]: And then I can pull up, if you want me to pull up the site plan, I can pull that up if you want.

196
00:18:26,455 --> 00:18:27,576
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that sounds great.

197
00:18:27,836 --> 00:18:28,056
[SPEAKER_20]: Sure.

198
00:18:42,548 --> 00:18:44,009
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, you guys can see that?

199
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:46,411
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, we can.

200
00:18:49,548 --> 00:18:54,911
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, so, uh, he would need, uh, and then the backfield here is the Tufts.

201
00:18:55,531 --> 00:18:57,772
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, it's a Tufts field, um, in the back.

202
00:18:58,693 --> 00:19:01,254
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, and then one neighbor on this side.

203
00:19:01,274 --> 00:19:06,737
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, and then, yeah, so it was just, this would be three feet as, um, shown here.

204
00:19:06,757 --> 00:19:12,600
[SPEAKER_20]: And then he has the required, so he wouldn't need, um, I don't think he would need any variants there.

205
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,301
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

206
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:16,462
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, um,

207
00:19:18,303 --> 00:19:20,184
[SPEAKER_09]: How does one access this garage?

208
00:19:20,224 --> 00:19:23,186
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a little unclear to me if there's a curb cut somewhere.

209
00:19:23,206 --> 00:19:27,328
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, so there should be a curb cut right here.

210
00:19:27,348 --> 00:19:29,009
[SPEAKER_20]: I think it's a 20-foot curb cut.

211
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:31,051
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

212
00:19:34,092 --> 00:19:34,693
[SPEAKER_20]: On Wellesley.

213
00:19:35,536 --> 00:19:38,017
[SPEAKER_09]: And is there a separate curb cut on Dartmouth Street?

214
00:19:38,698 --> 00:19:44,720
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, so he has a garage right here, four car garage.

215
00:19:44,881 --> 00:19:49,463
[SPEAKER_20]: And then he has a roughly, I don't know the exact, has a roughly 20 foot curb cut about here.

216
00:19:55,946 --> 00:19:58,067
[SPEAKER_09]: Other questions so far from the board?

217
00:20:05,221 --> 00:20:07,342
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, Mr. Chair, Andre, I have a question.

218
00:20:09,664 --> 00:20:17,348
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just curious why you need another 2-car garage if you already have a 4-car garage?

219
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:28,375
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, so he has a permit submitted to the city currently where he's turning this 4-car garage into a second unit.

220
00:20:28,915 --> 00:20:32,057
[SPEAKER_20]: So then therefore, he would lose all of his parking, basically.

221
00:20:34,288 --> 00:20:34,588
[SPEAKER_11]: Got it.

222
00:20:34,648 --> 00:20:43,056
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

223
00:20:43,536 --> 00:20:51,003
[SPEAKER_09]: And so have you discussed the extra curb cut with the city engineering department or the DBW?

224
00:20:51,263 --> 00:20:52,584
[SPEAKER_20]: The second curb cut?

225
00:20:56,696 --> 00:21:00,563
[SPEAKER_20]: Have you talked to the Medford Engineering Department?

226
00:21:01,244 --> 00:21:04,030
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Owen, maybe?

227
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:06,013
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, I did talk to him.

228
00:21:06,033 --> 00:21:07,456
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, yeah, you need it.

229
00:21:09,961 --> 00:21:11,362
[SPEAKER_00]: Chuck send that in and that's it.

230
00:21:11,382 --> 00:21:13,303
[SPEAKER_00]: There was nothing done after that.

231
00:21:13,383 --> 00:21:15,204
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know if you could hear him.

232
00:21:15,304 --> 00:21:19,266
[SPEAKER_20]: He said that he spoke with Owen and Owen said, of course, you need it.

233
00:21:19,706 --> 00:21:28,191
[SPEAKER_20]: And then he my father said he went and got plans drawn up from Medford Engineering for the curb cut.

234
00:21:29,965 --> 00:21:30,405
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not sure.

235
00:21:30,505 --> 00:21:33,347
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't think those have been submitted for the curb cut yet.

236
00:21:33,407 --> 00:21:39,711
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not, I'm not sure the process, how that works, um, if that was supposed to be done prior to this or post this or at the same time.

237
00:21:40,151 --> 00:21:40,592
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, but yeah.

238
00:21:41,992 --> 00:21:42,393
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

239
00:21:42,493 --> 00:21:57,202
[SPEAKER_09]: So the only thing, um, that might be helpful for us to know that I can think of that you haven't already shared is I know that the,

240
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:14,648
[SPEAKER_09]: City is generally taking the position that properties with a curb cut should not get a set impact on street parking, among other things.

241
00:22:14,668 --> 00:22:21,451
[SPEAKER_09]: And so here, we don't govern the approvals for that.

242
00:22:21,491 --> 00:22:25,513
[SPEAKER_09]: It would basically imply that a second

243
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,082
[SPEAKER_09]: curve cuts required.

244
00:22:28,824 --> 00:22:33,070
[SPEAKER_09]: You're intending to convert the existing garage.

245
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:42,683
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, am I correctly understanding you're not proposing removing the curve cut and

246
00:22:43,405 --> 00:22:45,646
[SPEAKER_09]: repurposing what's currently parking?

247
00:22:45,686 --> 00:22:46,106
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no.

248
00:22:46,207 --> 00:22:55,071
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, because there's still going to be a few parking spaces for two parking spaces for like this said unit in front of like in the driveway right here.

249
00:22:55,592 --> 00:22:55,832
[SPEAKER_20]: Got it.

250
00:22:56,952 --> 00:23:00,254
[SPEAKER_20]: And I would like, I can just touch upon Wellesley Street.

251
00:23:01,435 --> 00:23:05,457
[SPEAKER_20]: If that part's not permitted, and it's

252
00:23:05,957 --> 00:23:12,200
[SPEAKER_20]: I guess like a private road kind of where it's just like a dirt side with the fence.

253
00:23:12,921 --> 00:23:17,623
[SPEAKER_20]: So there's technically not supposed to be parking there anyway.

254
00:23:17,643 --> 00:23:21,025
[SPEAKER_20]: That's not like a curb sidewalk that you're allowed to park on.

255
00:23:21,045 --> 00:23:24,286
[SPEAKER_20]: I see.

256
00:23:24,627 --> 00:23:26,588
[SPEAKER_20]: If you guys, I'm not sure if you're familiar with that area.

257
00:23:27,128 --> 00:23:30,910
[SPEAKER_03]: I think people get it because it doesn't have a designated curb.

258
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:35,292
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still a side of the street that's parking available.

259
00:23:37,658 --> 00:23:41,119
[SPEAKER_03]: I would argue, though, that you're moving more people into this building.

260
00:23:41,239 --> 00:23:45,081
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you would essentially already be bringing cars.

261
00:23:45,101 --> 00:23:48,523
[SPEAKER_03]: So you would be taking up those spots that currently exist.

262
00:23:49,163 --> 00:23:50,544
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you're bringing them in.

263
00:23:51,324 --> 00:23:52,705
[SPEAKER_03]: So it would be one for one.

264
00:23:52,825 --> 00:23:53,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

265
00:23:53,125 --> 00:23:56,367
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say you're not you're still not losing it.

266
00:23:56,407 --> 00:24:05,511
[SPEAKER_03]: But I wouldn't say straight out that you're you're going to that that's not parking because that's not right either.

267
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,622
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, no, I mean, I'm not saying it's like not parking.

268
00:24:09,763 --> 00:24:12,905
[SPEAKER_20]: It's just not like, I guess, like the atypical what you would think of.

269
00:24:13,426 --> 00:24:19,250
[SPEAKER_20]: And I don't know how the city like deems it as like a private way, but they don't like repair that road for some reason.

270
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:21,472
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not, I'm not gonna get into that part.

271
00:24:21,492 --> 00:24:21,852
[SPEAKER_20]: But yeah.

272
00:24:23,794 --> 00:24:28,037
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so it's, it's a bit complicated.

273
00:24:28,097 --> 00:24:30,059
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, if we need to go down the rabbit hole, we can.

274
00:24:30,139 --> 00:24:35,363
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think the short version of it is my understanding is that even as a private

275
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:43,386
[SPEAKER_09]: way the public can and does park along Wellesley Street.

276
00:24:44,027 --> 00:24:52,173
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, Yvette, to your point, it's the reconfiguration of the house does on average imply adding cars.

277
00:24:52,994 --> 00:24:57,898
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that's a fair point.

278
00:24:58,338 --> 00:25:02,822
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, other questions from members of the board?

279
00:25:04,251 --> 00:25:17,755
[SPEAKER_03]: I would ask just about that curb cut or the paveway leading onto the street to the applicant's point that that side of the street is a little more less kept.

280
00:25:18,515 --> 00:25:24,677
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there going to be a driveway that leads all the way to the street that will be cleaning up all that stuff or is it still going to be a dirt path?

281
00:25:24,697 --> 00:25:33,380
[SPEAKER_20]: He would pave from his property to the garage door or whatever all the way up until the asphalted street.

282
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:37,232
[SPEAKER_20]: So then where does trash go?

283
00:25:38,613 --> 00:25:40,294
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like I'm always asking the trash question.

284
00:25:41,875 --> 00:25:45,257
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you now have two spaces, where did it go?

285
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:47,739
[SPEAKER_20]: And now where does it go?

286
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:53,163
[SPEAKER_20]: Along the side of his fence over here, he has his two barrels for his current single family.

287
00:25:53,263 --> 00:25:56,165
[SPEAKER_20]: So he would just put the four barrels total,

288
00:25:56,965 --> 00:25:59,686
[SPEAKER_20]: two-track, two-recycling in the same spot.

289
00:26:00,026 --> 00:26:13,212
[SPEAKER_20]: Him himself would come down the stairs in the exact same way that he does it now, and then the new tenant's front door is going to be here as well, and then they would also just come right over to the side by the fence.

290
00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:18,414
[SPEAKER_03]: It still gets picked up in front of Dartmouth, not the other side of the street.

291
00:26:18,654 --> 00:26:19,134
[SPEAKER_20]: Exactly.

292
00:26:19,814 --> 00:26:25,497
[SPEAKER_20]: The property address is 100 Dartmouth, and then the front door for both units will be on 100 Dartmouth.

293
00:26:29,375 --> 00:26:37,419
[SPEAKER_20]: And then the way he's planning on using the garage, this is gonna be solely, like this is his back door and it's gonna stay.

294
00:26:37,439 --> 00:26:41,780
[SPEAKER_20]: And then he's gonna, him and my mother are gonna use this garage.

295
00:26:42,141 --> 00:26:45,042
[SPEAKER_20]: And then basically like, they'll just go from the garage into the back door.

296
00:26:45,482 --> 00:26:51,144
[SPEAKER_20]: And then the new other unit that's gonna be like on the right would just have like the driveway spots.

297
00:26:55,206 --> 00:26:56,947
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is that is gonna benefit

298
00:26:57,896 --> 00:27:01,968
[SPEAKER_03]: the owner to make it easier for them to get in and out, right?

299
00:27:02,048 --> 00:27:04,876
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that is someone who needs maybe

300
00:27:06,863 --> 00:27:35,066
[SPEAKER_20]: closer spot right instead of doing like a handicap spot or something or in the future that might be needed right we need to like think about that exactly you know my parents they're senior citizens so of course they you know the closer to the you know this is only I think four stairs maybe in the front is whatever seven or something so it's less stairs to get into the house for them as well so it is beneficial for them and then I

301
00:27:36,449 --> 00:27:44,790
[SPEAKER_20]: It retains that their second unit or the other apartment that they're trying to build would also get two parking spaces.

302
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:48,871
[SPEAKER_20]: So each tenant, therefore, would have two parking spaces.

303
00:27:55,472 --> 00:27:56,032
[SPEAKER_10]: Mary, go ahead.

304
00:27:56,333 --> 00:27:57,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

305
00:27:57,273 --> 00:28:00,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you mind pulling up the Google view for this?

306
00:28:00,513 --> 00:28:02,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it a red house?

307
00:28:03,274 --> 00:28:04,534
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, like reddish wood.

308
00:28:07,149 --> 00:28:11,713
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't see I don't see where the proposed garage is.

309
00:28:11,793 --> 00:28:13,535
[SPEAKER_04]: I always see just one side of the house.

310
00:28:14,115 --> 00:28:14,355
[SPEAKER_20]: Sure.

311
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:21,862
[SPEAKER_20]: So this is their house right here.

312
00:28:23,263 --> 00:28:25,325
[SPEAKER_20]: So the garage would be right here.

313
00:28:25,785 --> 00:28:34,593
[SPEAKER_20]: So three feet away from the Tufts field and 10 feet away from their like backyard or the back of their house.

314
00:28:37,133 --> 00:28:38,473
[SPEAKER_20]: And then did you want the street view?

315
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:40,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, please.

316
00:28:40,494 --> 00:28:40,734
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

317
00:28:45,136 --> 00:28:49,017
[SPEAKER_20]: So this is the back of their house or so wrong way.

318
00:28:55,439 --> 00:28:57,579
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's kind of hard to say but yeah, three.

319
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,160
[SPEAKER_20]: Sorry about that.

320
00:29:05,182 --> 00:29:05,342
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

321
00:29:06,535 --> 00:29:10,737
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, so 3 feet from this fence and then 10 feet from like this house.

322
00:29:10,777 --> 00:29:15,799
[SPEAKER_20]: So it would basically be like, kind of where that like, what fence structure is right?

323
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:16,440
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

324
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:17,340
[SPEAKER_20]: Yep.

325
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,602
[SPEAKER_20]: And then as you can, like, of course, the people use this, but.

326
00:29:21,562 --> 00:29:23,083
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, take it for what it's worth, I suppose.

327
00:29:28,746 --> 00:29:31,547
[SPEAKER_10]: Right other questions from the board.

328
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:52,390
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, so before we open for public comment, I just want to describe the process the board has to follow for the requested relief.

329
00:29:52,510 --> 00:30:02,739
[SPEAKER_09]: So because this is too close in the side yard, I think that if I'm

330
00:30:03,522 --> 00:30:12,409
[SPEAKER_09]: understanding correctly, because it's next to this field at Tufts, the backyard isn't triggered, but certainly the side yard is too close.

331
00:30:12,469 --> 00:30:26,259
[SPEAKER_09]: So the board would have to establish that due to circumstances pertaining to the shape, topography or soil conditions of a lot of structures that aren't generated,

332
00:30:28,082 --> 00:30:33,464
[SPEAKER_09]: It would create a hardship if we literally enforced the zoning ordinance and didn't grant the requested relief.

333
00:30:33,544 --> 00:30:47,928
[SPEAKER_09]: So the structures are positioned on the lot such that there's no eligible forming and logical location to place a garage.

334
00:30:48,468 --> 00:30:55,470
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be one example of a situation where the board might decide that that's unusual circumstances.

335
00:30:57,666 --> 00:30:58,587
[SPEAKER_09]: that create a hardship.

336
00:30:58,867 --> 00:31:13,400
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, if you do have any argument you'd like to make about the hardship that would be imposed if the board didn't really enforce the zoning ordinance, now would be a good time.

337
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:15,401
[SPEAKER_09]: So what would happen if you didn't get the relief?

338
00:31:15,501 --> 00:31:17,303
[SPEAKER_09]: Could you place a garage anywhere?

339
00:31:18,158 --> 00:31:21,139
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, so we wouldn't be able to place a garage anywhere.

340
00:31:21,439 --> 00:31:27,160
[SPEAKER_20]: And then therefore that he wouldn't meet the parking requirements for his second unit either.

341
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:32,701
[SPEAKER_20]: So he wouldn't meet that hardship of not being able to convert as well, when the time comes.

342
00:31:34,162 --> 00:31:34,462
[SPEAKER_09]: Got it.

343
00:31:34,882 --> 00:31:35,142
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

344
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:44,064
[SPEAKER_09]: So just so I'm clear the plans before us, this is a single family, and you're proposing

345
00:31:44,863 --> 00:31:46,343
[SPEAKER_09]: a garage in this location.

346
00:31:46,363 --> 00:31:47,204
[SPEAKER_10]: Correct.

347
00:31:47,484 --> 00:31:50,945
[SPEAKER_09]: But the intention is that eventually you do a conversion.

348
00:31:50,965 --> 00:31:57,047
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's yeah, that those plans have already been submitted and are working their way through approval.

349
00:31:57,547 --> 00:31:57,827
[SPEAKER_20]: Got it.

350
00:31:58,107 --> 00:32:01,248
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

351
00:32:01,328 --> 00:32:03,589
[SPEAKER_09]: Other questions from the board?

352
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:08,590
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to open it up to public comment.

353
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:12,911
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're a member of the public and would like to speak on this matter, you may do so now.

354
00:32:13,832 --> 00:32:14,332
[SPEAKER_09]: You can

355
00:32:16,537 --> 00:32:23,623
[SPEAKER_09]: raise your hand on Zoom, turn on your camera, raise your hand, type something in the chat, or you can email Dennis, dmcdougal at medford-ma.gov.

356
00:32:23,843 --> 00:32:25,284
[SPEAKER_18]: Chris, I'm going to drop the screen share, too.

357
00:32:25,764 --> 00:32:26,305
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, thank you.

358
00:32:37,233 --> 00:32:37,534
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

359
00:32:37,734 --> 00:32:41,517
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not seeing any members of the public who would like to speak on this matter.

360
00:32:43,173 --> 00:32:50,559
[SPEAKER_09]: So the chair awaits a motion to close the public portion of the hearing and motion to close the public portion of the hearing and debate.

361
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,060
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

362
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:52,761
[SPEAKER_09]: Do I have a second?

363
00:32:55,443 --> 00:32:55,783
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

364
00:32:56,824 --> 00:32:57,164
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

365
00:32:57,384 --> 00:32:58,665
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to take a roll call.

366
00:32:58,705 --> 00:32:59,046
[SPEAKER_09]: Jim?

367
00:32:59,746 --> 00:33:00,026
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

368
00:33:00,487 --> 00:33:00,907
[SPEAKER_09]: Mary?

369
00:33:00,927 --> 00:33:00,987
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

370
00:33:02,328 --> 00:33:02,809
[SPEAKER_09]: Andre?

371
00:33:02,829 --> 00:33:03,349
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

372
00:33:03,869 --> 00:33:04,210
[SPEAKER_09]: Chris?

373
00:33:05,331 --> 00:33:05,511
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

374
00:33:05,891 --> 00:33:06,231
[SPEAKER_09]: Yvette?

375
00:33:07,192 --> 00:33:07,332
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

376
00:33:08,033 --> 00:33:08,353
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

377
00:33:08,933 --> 00:33:09,974
[SPEAKER_09]: We are now deliberating.

378
00:33:10,014 --> 00:33:10,755
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you think, folks?

379
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:20,530
[SPEAKER_11]: 100.

380
00:33:15,068 --> 00:33:20,530
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that they have enough square footage to put a second unit in this.

381
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:28,373
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that this garage would be the only location to put it.

382
00:33:28,533 --> 00:33:33,996
[SPEAKER_11]: It would be, I think, a hardship to try to locate parking on the site in any other location.

383
00:33:34,016 --> 00:33:37,097
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

384
00:33:37,397 --> 00:33:38,097
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Andre.

385
00:33:38,197 --> 00:33:39,338
[SPEAKER_10]: Other thoughts from the board?

386
00:33:49,622 --> 00:34:04,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Chair, I also agree if they're going to have parking requirements for the second year, and they obviously have to put it somewhere on the property and I'm inclined to approve.

387
00:34:05,335 --> 00:34:06,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Sad to see that garden go though.

388
00:34:07,897 --> 00:34:11,219
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, they'll still have a plenty big enough garden.

389
00:34:13,343 --> 00:34:16,086
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, Yvette, it looked like you were going to say something as well.

390
00:34:17,046 --> 00:34:34,822
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just going to add that I actually think it would be a detriment to the neighbors because then, again, there might be a hardship for parking, to find the parking for owners themselves, I think, besides it being a burden to move.

391
00:34:35,583 --> 00:34:40,648
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd lose a lot more of the yard if you had to put it elsewhere on the lots where it would go.

392
00:34:41,687 --> 00:34:50,389
[SPEAKER_03]: And also for the door, for the owners themselves, I think it's an improvement for their lives as well as, again, the neighborhood.

393
00:34:50,409 --> 00:34:54,310
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

394
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:56,571
[SPEAKER_10]: Other thoughts from the board?

395
00:35:10,894 --> 00:35:11,254
[SPEAKER_10]: Andre?

396
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:16,822
[SPEAKER_11]: a motion to approve the variances for 100 Dartmouth Street.

397
00:35:17,662 --> 00:35:20,703
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, we're going to take a roll call.

398
00:35:20,783 --> 00:35:21,283
[SPEAKER_09]: Mary?

399
00:35:21,303 --> 00:35:22,043
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

400
00:35:22,604 --> 00:35:22,984
[SPEAKER_09]: Chris?

401
00:35:23,564 --> 00:35:23,704
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

402
00:35:24,284 --> 00:35:24,624
[SPEAKER_09]: Yvette?

403
00:35:25,925 --> 00:35:26,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

404
00:35:26,565 --> 00:35:26,925
[SPEAKER_09]: Jim?

405
00:35:27,565 --> 00:35:27,685
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

406
00:35:28,386 --> 00:35:28,746
[SPEAKER_09]: Andre?

407
00:35:28,766 --> 00:35:29,386
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

408
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:31,387
[SPEAKER_09]: This is approved.

409
00:35:32,327 --> 00:35:35,488
[SPEAKER_09]: So Dennis, we'll go ahead and

410
00:35:36,665 --> 00:35:43,330
[SPEAKER_09]: draft the language on the decision, and then you'd walk them through the next steps, then?

411
00:35:44,491 --> 00:35:45,072
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep, exactly.

412
00:35:45,112 --> 00:35:46,273
[SPEAKER_18]: So, Jordan, Chris.

413
00:35:46,553 --> 00:35:47,694
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'll write up the decision.

414
00:35:47,834 --> 00:35:50,096
[SPEAKER_18]: It'll get reviewed by our legal counsel.

415
00:35:50,756 --> 00:35:52,478
[SPEAKER_18]: And then it'll come back to me.

416
00:35:52,538 --> 00:35:54,039
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll send it off to the board for signatures.

417
00:35:54,159 --> 00:35:57,141
[SPEAKER_18]: Once we get the signatures, I'll file it in the clerk's office.

418
00:35:58,122 --> 00:36:04,608
[SPEAKER_18]: And at that point, so that's probably still a few weeks away from now, at that point, there's a 20 days appeals period.

419
00:36:05,493 --> 00:36:09,676
[SPEAKER_18]: And once those 20 days are done, then you can go and get your permit.

420
00:36:10,156 --> 00:36:10,697
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, perfect.

421
00:36:10,777 --> 00:36:17,762
[SPEAKER_18]: So the time from now to getting the permit is probably about a month and a half away or so give or take give or take, you know, schedule something so much.

422
00:36:17,782 --> 00:36:18,042
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

423
00:36:18,082 --> 00:36:18,322
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

424
00:36:18,362 --> 00:36:21,945
[SPEAKER_20]: And I said we had a follow up question about the curb cut.

425
00:36:22,005 --> 00:36:27,388
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's not through here that way he would just go to the engineering department and apply for it.

426
00:36:28,489 --> 00:36:29,630
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, right.

427
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:31,751
[SPEAKER_09]: So the issue a permit for that.

428
00:36:31,771 --> 00:36:32,272
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

429
00:36:34,142 --> 00:36:39,586
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I said, my understanding is they're not general fans of the double curb cut.

430
00:36:39,767 --> 00:36:42,489
[SPEAKER_09]: And for a lot of the buy right stuff, they're denying it.

431
00:36:42,569 --> 00:36:54,238
[SPEAKER_09]: But I also understand that they tend to be reluctant to deny permits in cases where the zoning board approved something because it would basically kill the project.

432
00:36:54,278 --> 00:36:56,200
[SPEAKER_09]: So ultimately, that's for them to decide.

433
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,643
[SPEAKER_09]: And we can't condition our decision on that.

434
00:36:59,743 --> 00:37:00,764
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, perfect.

435
00:37:00,784 --> 00:37:01,184
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

436
00:37:01,224 --> 00:37:01,744
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you very much.

437
00:37:01,784 --> 00:37:02,405
[SPEAKER_20]: Appreciate your time.

438
00:37:04,578 --> 00:37:04,858
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

439
00:37:05,038 --> 00:37:05,198
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks.

440
00:37:05,418 --> 00:37:07,260
[SPEAKER_20]: Have a good night.

441
00:37:08,161 --> 00:37:10,543
[SPEAKER_18]: What's next.

442
00:37:10,803 --> 00:37:23,574
[SPEAKER_18]: 76 Greenleaf Avenue case number a dash 2025 dash 11 applicant and owner Russell Robar to provide massage therapy services 76 Greenleaf Avenue single family home a single family to district, not allowed for the city of Bedford zoning ordinance.

443
00:37:25,104 --> 00:37:25,364
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

444
00:37:25,664 --> 00:37:26,425
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, thanks.

445
00:37:26,485 --> 00:37:31,849
[SPEAKER_09]: And Dennis, just before we get started, I want to double check, um, the requested relief here.

446
00:37:32,009 --> 00:37:37,333
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is a request for a special permit for an accessory use.

447
00:37:37,373 --> 00:37:37,873
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that right?

448
00:37:39,735 --> 00:37:49,842
[SPEAKER_18]: That's the way I, that's the way we sort of, we just, let me just give me one half second to call up the technical serve to see if there's any extra comments on it.

449
00:37:51,403 --> 00:37:51,603
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

450
00:37:51,663 --> 00:37:53,805
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, while you're doing that, Dennis, we can, um,

451
00:37:54,818 --> 00:37:57,541
[SPEAKER_09]: we can let the applicant get started.

452
00:37:57,721 --> 00:38:00,864
[SPEAKER_09]: So I see we have a Russell Robar on the call.

453
00:38:02,825 --> 00:38:04,707
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you here to speak on this matter, Russell?

454
00:38:10,633 --> 00:38:10,933
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

455
00:38:10,953 --> 00:38:11,513
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi everybody.

456
00:38:11,534 --> 00:38:12,214
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks for your time.

457
00:38:12,234 --> 00:38:13,175
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi.

458
00:38:13,756 --> 00:38:14,176
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening.

459
00:38:15,837 --> 00:38:18,600
[SPEAKER_19]: I've been a licensed massage therapist for over 30 years.

460
00:38:20,618 --> 00:38:31,388
[SPEAKER_19]: And I primarily work downtown, but my wife and I, we do have a guest bedroom in our house and I work on my family.

461
00:38:32,629 --> 00:38:41,477
[SPEAKER_19]: And I have a lot of clients that come in from outside of the city, convenient for them to just drive in.

462
00:38:41,697 --> 00:38:46,562
[SPEAKER_19]: We have two parking, guest parking permits and park in front of the house and come up

463
00:38:48,472 --> 00:38:53,876
[SPEAKER_19]: I still need to get a solo establishment license from the state.

464
00:38:54,757 --> 00:39:04,964
[SPEAKER_19]: So they still will come in and look at the room and make sure that it is passes their criteria.

465
00:39:05,245 --> 00:39:07,887
[SPEAKER_19]: But the first thing that I need is a business license.

466
00:39:08,447 --> 00:39:09,388
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's why I'm here.

467
00:39:10,989 --> 00:39:11,830
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, got it.

468
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:14,932
[SPEAKER_09]: And so am I correctly understanding that

469
00:39:16,229 --> 00:39:27,335
[SPEAKER_09]: you would need the board to grant this special permit for the accessory use to get that business license, and then you'd need that to bring to the state?

470
00:39:28,515 --> 00:39:28,955
[SPEAKER_19]: Correct.

471
00:39:29,015 --> 00:39:44,003
[SPEAKER_19]: I have to then apply for solo establishment license to the state, and then they send an inspector to inspect the location, the room, to make sure that it passes their criteria, so that then I can get a solo establishment license.

472
00:39:44,751 --> 00:39:48,492
[SPEAKER_19]: So it still has to be passed by the state as well.

473
00:39:51,613 --> 00:39:56,055
[SPEAKER_09]: And so the board may have some questions.

474
00:39:56,115 --> 00:39:58,155
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, by the way, I'm going to act as last time.

475
00:39:58,235 --> 00:40:00,896
[SPEAKER_09]: So everyone except for me is voting.

476
00:40:03,357 --> 00:40:11,840
[SPEAKER_09]: So for accessory uses, or sorry, from home occupations,

477
00:40:13,403 --> 00:40:16,284
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, there's some that are allowed as a right.

478
00:40:16,324 --> 00:40:18,164
[SPEAKER_09]: There's some that require a special permit.

479
00:40:18,904 --> 00:40:22,345
[SPEAKER_09]: My understanding is that this one does require a special permit.

480
00:40:23,165 --> 00:40:42,068
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, um, the requirements are that the home occupation be conducted solely within, uh, the dwelling by the person's occupying that dwelling as a primary residence, that, uh, the use is incidental.

481
00:40:44,689 --> 00:41:09,077
[SPEAKER_09]: to the property, so it's primarily a residential property and this is secondary use, that the use doesn't produce offensive noise, vibration, smoke, dust, odors, heat, lighting, electrical interference, radioactive pollution, that there's no regular sale of wares of goods on the premise, that it does not utilize exterior storage of material or equipment,

482
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:31,396
[SPEAKER_09]: and that there's no more than two non-resident employees, that there's no exterior indication of the presence other than a sign or nameplate in compliance with the sign ordinance.

483
00:41:35,499 --> 00:41:38,282
[SPEAKER_09]: And so if all of those conditions are met,

484
00:41:39,018 --> 00:41:54,249
[SPEAKER_09]: then the Board of Appeals can grant a special permit subject to conditions including but not limited to restricting the hours of operation, the maximum floor area, the off-street parking, and the maximum number of daily customer or other vehicle trips.

485
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:59,253
[SPEAKER_09]: And that permit terminates with transfer of ownership of the property.

486
00:42:01,515 --> 00:42:04,877
[SPEAKER_09]: So, just wanted the Board to have that context.

487
00:42:06,352 --> 00:42:14,257
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'll just have probably six clients a day, one an hour, so six cars a day.

488
00:42:14,277 --> 00:42:17,819
[SPEAKER_19]: And like I said, we have guest permit parking out front.

489
00:42:17,959 --> 00:42:22,361
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's not really going to affect the street at all.

490
00:42:23,562 --> 00:42:28,765
[SPEAKER_09]: And so do you already know what your intended hours of operation are?

491
00:42:29,525 --> 00:42:30,826
[SPEAKER_19]: Typically, I'm like 10 to 6.

492
00:42:31,126 --> 00:42:32,927
[SPEAKER_19]: So 10 to 6?

493
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:33,988
[SPEAKER_09]: 10 AM to 6 PM.

494
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:40,521
[SPEAKER_09]: And is this, uh, on a, is, is the day of the week already one?

495
00:42:40,681 --> 00:42:42,242
[SPEAKER_19]: On a Monday.

496
00:42:42,402 --> 00:42:43,523
[SPEAKER_19]: I work during the week.

497
00:42:43,743 --> 00:42:44,743
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't work on the weekends.

498
00:42:45,544 --> 00:42:45,844
[SPEAKER_09]: I see.

499
00:42:46,444 --> 00:42:49,025
[SPEAKER_09]: So Mondays end to six.

500
00:42:49,686 --> 00:42:49,886
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

501
00:42:50,786 --> 00:42:54,308
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, one customer per hour.

502
00:42:55,048 --> 00:42:55,789
[SPEAKER_19]: Approximately.

503
00:42:55,809 --> 00:42:55,949
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

504
00:42:56,209 --> 00:42:56,769
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.

505
00:42:56,789 --> 00:43:05,714
[SPEAKER_09]: So you anticipate, uh, roughly six, um, maybe more on some days, but, um,

506
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,981
[SPEAKER_09]: you'd be working for the eight hours, 10 a.m.

507
00:43:09,101 --> 00:43:10,121
[SPEAKER_09]: to 6 p.m.

508
00:43:10,281 --> 00:43:10,621
[SPEAKER_19]: Correct.

509
00:43:11,441 --> 00:43:16,642
[SPEAKER_19]: I'd say not more than like eight people, but again, it's, I can only work on one person at a time.

510
00:43:17,102 --> 00:43:19,223
[SPEAKER_19]: So one person will show up and one person will leave.

511
00:43:19,283 --> 00:43:22,164
[SPEAKER_19]: So, and we have two guest parking permits.

512
00:43:23,404 --> 00:43:23,704
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

513
00:43:25,504 --> 00:43:28,925
[SPEAKER_19]: My wife and I have a driveway, so our cars are in the driveway.

514
00:43:28,945 --> 00:43:31,146
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

515
00:43:31,566 --> 00:43:33,166
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, questions from the board.

516
00:43:39,358 --> 00:43:40,759
[SPEAKER_11]: Andre.

517
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:41,960
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

518
00:43:43,522 --> 00:43:45,043
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you have a waiting area?

519
00:43:45,063 --> 00:43:55,012
[SPEAKER_19]: Typically, what I'm going to do is just have them wait in the car, because I need to bring out the guest permit.

520
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:59,897
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll have them wait in the car, go out, give them the permit, walk them into the room.

521
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:02,079
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks.

522
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,182
[SPEAKER_10]: Other questions from the board?

523
00:44:07,151 --> 00:44:18,761
[SPEAKER_03]: Would there ever be a time where you would just leave your cars on the street and let the guests park in the driveway?

524
00:44:21,103 --> 00:44:24,306
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't see that happening because we have the guest permit.

525
00:44:24,346 --> 00:44:31,812
[SPEAKER_19]: So they would just, it's actually easier for them because we're the main entrance to the door.

526
00:44:34,987 --> 00:44:40,972
[SPEAKER_19]: Guest bedrooms up the flight of stairs that are closest to the main entrance, and they just come in and walk up the stairs.

527
00:44:41,652 --> 00:44:44,335
[SPEAKER_19]: And literally, you walk across the hall into the guest bedroom.

528
00:44:44,575 --> 00:44:47,177
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's actually easier from the street.

529
00:44:47,998 --> 00:44:51,821
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, we could do that, but I don't think that would happen.

530
00:44:51,841 --> 00:45:00,868
[SPEAKER_03]: And how do you anticipate handling a snow emergency?

531
00:45:03,581 --> 00:45:05,002
[SPEAKER_19]: No one would come.

532
00:45:05,522 --> 00:45:07,343
[SPEAKER_19]: You just, things happen.

533
00:45:07,683 --> 00:45:16,930
[SPEAKER_19]: If it's a snow emergency, I wouldn't want my clients to come on a day like that and have them obstruct the plowing.

534
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:20,952
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

535
00:45:22,854 --> 00:45:23,114
[SPEAKER_10]: Chris?

536
00:45:25,015 --> 00:45:27,557
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Mr. Chair, I just was wondering, do the

537
00:45:32,262 --> 00:45:36,667
[SPEAKER_05]: parking permits allow people to use it all day.

538
00:45:36,687 --> 00:45:37,509
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't remember.

539
00:45:37,529 --> 00:45:43,697
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some limit to how they're

540
00:45:47,724 --> 00:45:48,165
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not sure.

541
00:45:48,185 --> 00:45:49,266
[SPEAKER_19]: Do you want me to just run and get it?

542
00:45:49,306 --> 00:45:50,807
[SPEAKER_19]: I can read it to you.

543
00:45:51,048 --> 00:45:55,312
[SPEAKER_19]: No, I'm for your own benefit.

544
00:45:55,732 --> 00:46:02,939
[SPEAKER_05]: I would just check with the parking office to make sure that you can do that versus what Yvette just said, which is maybe a little.

545
00:46:07,479 --> 00:46:12,061
[SPEAKER_06]: Medford City Council 12th regular meeting June 24, 2025 is called to order.

566
00:46:55,428 --> 00:47:04,595
[SPEAKER_06]: Whereas the Medford City Council has learned with deep sadness of the passing of Richard Caraviello, who passed away June 3rd, 2025, at the age of 93.

567
00:47:05,276 --> 00:47:15,103

[SPEAKER_06]: And whereas Richard honorably served his country in the United States Army during the Korean War, and has continued to serve his community as the longtime proprietor

569
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:43,670

[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Carviello, again, we talk about legacies here in Medford and what families have done to build method to the city that we all love.

577
00:48:44,622 --> 00:48:47,863
[SPEAKER_17]: And Mr. Carviello was one of those founders.

578
00:48:47,963 --> 00:48:55,425
[SPEAKER_17]: And you could see that in the man he raised in our former city council, President Richard Carviello.

579
00:48:56,106 --> 00:48:56,446
[SPEAKER_17]: And I

580
00:48:57,929 --> 00:49:08,437
[SPEAKER_17]: If you know Richard, if you know Rick, you know that he has, and even as a retired city councilor, how hard he works for the residents of Medford to this day.

581
00:49:09,057 --> 00:49:16,123
[SPEAKER_17]: And every time we talked, Rick would talk about the work ethic instilled in him by his dad.

582
00:49:16,763 --> 00:49:20,646
[SPEAKER_17]: And you see that throughout his family.

583
00:49:20,946 --> 00:49:21,207
[SPEAKER_17]: And, um,

584
00:49:22,925 --> 00:49:33,091
[SPEAKER_17]: Most importantly, you really see the true dedication of family, love and passion, and really someone that we know that Mr. Carviello fought very hard.

585
00:49:33,291 --> 00:49:43,357
[SPEAKER_17]: He spent many years in assisted living, and it was very difficult at the end, but he's in a better place today, and we send the Carviello family our condolences.

586
00:49:43,417 --> 00:49:48,981
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you for allowing this motion to be put forth, Mr. President.

587
00:49:49,581 --> 00:49:49,961
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

588
00:49:50,081 --> 00:49:50,782
[SPEAKER_17]: President Collins.

589
00:49:51,918 --> 00:49:59,243
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to thank my colleagues for putting this resolution forward and join with you in extending my deepest and most heartfelt condolences to the entire Carabiello family.

590
00:50:00,765 --> 00:50:02,846
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Vice President Collins.

591
00:50:05,128 --> 00:50:06,689
[SPEAKER_06]: I served with Rick for four years.

592
00:50:06,709 --> 00:50:10,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Would it be possible to go inside your house?

593
00:50:17,937 --> 00:50:21,300
[SPEAKER_19]: The doorbell, I would come down and answer the doorbell and they could absolutely do that.

594
00:50:23,344 --> 00:50:24,765
[SPEAKER_19]: So I mean, that happens.

595
00:50:24,825 --> 00:50:25,405
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm at my house.

596
00:50:25,425 --> 00:50:26,505
[SPEAKER_19]: Someone rings the doorbell.

597
00:50:26,906 --> 00:50:28,346
[SPEAKER_19]: I come down to see it.

598
00:50:28,386 --> 00:50:36,970
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not, I mean, it's kind of a more casual business approach because it is a house.

599
00:50:37,070 --> 00:50:42,193
[SPEAKER_19]: And someone rings the doorbell.

600
00:50:42,493 --> 00:50:43,253
[SPEAKER_19]: I go answer it.

601
00:50:43,773 --> 00:50:45,954
[SPEAKER_19]: You come back and then finish the work.

602
00:50:46,034 --> 00:50:48,395
[SPEAKER_19]: So I specialize in sports and injury work.

603
00:50:50,550 --> 00:50:53,293
[SPEAKER_19]: Manny Ramirez, David Ortiz.

604
00:50:53,973 --> 00:51:00,819
[SPEAKER_19]: So I work with a lot of ultimate frisbee players as a pro ultimate team in Medford.

605
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:08,706
[SPEAKER_19]: I work with half the team, the coaches, the owners, a lot of top students I work with in town.

606
00:51:09,747 --> 00:51:14,632
[SPEAKER_19]: So it would just be really convenient to work here.

607
00:51:15,515 --> 00:51:16,657
[SPEAKER_19]: But yes, absolutely.

608
00:51:16,717 --> 00:51:21,086
[SPEAKER_19]: If someone had to go to the bathroom and they would come in and ring the bell, I would let them in.

609
00:51:23,270 --> 00:51:24,272
[SPEAKER_19]: And we have two restrooms.

610
00:51:24,292 --> 00:51:26,055
[SPEAKER_19]: We have a downstairs one and an upstairs one.

611
00:51:28,743 --> 00:51:32,565
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think you probably had discussed it before, but I just want to make sure that I got it clear.

612
00:51:32,945 --> 00:51:36,687
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have to get the approval from zoning first.

613
00:51:37,827 --> 00:51:42,390
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the very first step before you apply for the other licenses.

614
00:51:45,431 --> 00:51:53,715
[SPEAKER_19]: I need a business license from the city first and with the application for the solo establishment license from the state.

615
00:51:54,283 --> 00:51:55,484
[SPEAKER_19]: that's one of the criteria.

616
00:51:55,544 --> 00:52:01,028
[SPEAKER_19]: So if I don't have the business license, I can't get the solo establishment license.

617
00:52:03,029 --> 00:52:07,673
[SPEAKER_04]: And is massage therapist, is that licensed too?

618
00:52:08,533 --> 00:52:11,175
[SPEAKER_19]: I am a licensed massage therapist for over 30 years.

619
00:52:12,616 --> 00:52:13,016
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

620
00:52:13,457 --> 00:52:16,379
[SPEAKER_19]: So but the space itself, the rooms,

621
00:52:18,658 --> 00:52:20,919
[SPEAKER_19]: then need to be licensed.

622
00:52:20,959 --> 00:52:33,206
[SPEAKER_19]: So the inspector comes in, you need a fire extinguisher, a fire alarm, a sink, bathroom, get the licensing from the state and a business license.

623
00:52:33,247 --> 00:52:35,868
[SPEAKER_19]: So those are all the things, plus a few other things.

624
00:52:36,889 --> 00:52:37,989
[SPEAKER_19]: A covered trash can.

625
00:52:38,049 --> 00:52:40,531
[SPEAKER_19]: I just found that out six months ago.

626
00:52:41,852 --> 00:52:44,693
[SPEAKER_19]: The inspector came and said, oh, you need a cover in your trash can.

627
00:52:44,713 --> 00:52:47,095
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm like, okay, no one else has told me that before.

628
00:52:54,762 --> 00:52:59,947
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, so I'm going to open it for comments from members of the public.

629
00:52:59,987 --> 00:53:04,171
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you're a member of the public who would like to speak on this matter, you may do so now.

630
00:53:04,191 --> 00:53:08,815
[SPEAKER_09]: You can raise your hand on Zoom, turn on your camera, and raise your hand.

631
00:53:08,835 --> 00:53:11,237
[SPEAKER_10]: Or you can email Dennis at google.com.

632
00:53:22,290 --> 00:53:25,793
[SPEAKER_10]: Not seeing any members of the public that would like to speak.

633
00:53:26,873 --> 00:53:28,194
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to close public hearing.

634
00:53:30,296 --> 00:53:30,676
[SPEAKER_11]: Second.

635
00:53:31,757 --> 00:53:33,578
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, we're going to take a roll call.

636
00:53:33,618 --> 00:53:33,979
[SPEAKER_09]: Jim?

637
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:35,800
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

638
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:36,680
[SPEAKER_09]: Mary?

639
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:37,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

640
00:53:38,442 --> 00:53:38,882
[SPEAKER_09]: Andre?

641
00:53:38,902 --> 00:53:39,542
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

642
00:53:40,303 --> 00:53:40,603
[SPEAKER_09]: Chris?

643
00:53:41,884 --> 00:53:42,104
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

644
00:53:42,885 --> 00:53:43,105
[SPEAKER_09]: Beth?

645
00:53:44,286 --> 00:53:44,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

646
00:53:45,687 --> 00:53:48,449
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, we are now deliberating.

647
00:53:49,610 --> 00:53:51,331
[SPEAKER_09]: And so just to reiterate,

648
00:53:52,457 --> 00:53:55,859
[SPEAKER_09]: the relevant part of what I said earlier.

649
00:53:55,979 --> 00:54:02,503
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's a bunch of conditions that need to be met for a home occupation by special permit.

650
00:54:05,245 --> 00:54:13,330
[SPEAKER_09]: My understanding is that this does meet all of the required conditions as described.

651
00:54:15,312 --> 00:54:15,952
[SPEAKER_09]: And so

652
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:37,706
[SPEAKER_09]: In that case, the board may issue a special permit subject condition to restricting the hours of operation, the maximum floor area, off-street parking, and the maximum number of daily customer or other vehicle trips.

653
00:54:41,327 --> 00:54:45,249
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, I think the board should discuss.

654
00:54:46,369 --> 00:54:48,430
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't have to meet a variance standard or anything.

655
00:54:50,638 --> 00:54:58,583
[SPEAKER_09]: on the merits, would there be substantial detriment to the public good in granting this license?

656
00:54:58,843 --> 00:55:08,509
[SPEAKER_09]: And what are the conditions that we would need to impose such detriment?

657
00:55:12,131 --> 00:55:12,451
[SPEAKER_09]: Mary.

658
00:55:13,552 --> 00:55:16,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we pull up a street view of the property?

659
00:55:16,514 --> 00:55:19,656
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that something we could do?

660
00:55:21,330 --> 00:55:21,770
[SPEAKER_10]: I can do that.

661
00:55:21,890 --> 00:55:23,071
[SPEAKER_10]: Give me a second.

662
00:55:31,015 --> 00:55:33,396
[SPEAKER_19]: Also, I'm not going to have an external sign.

663
00:55:34,536 --> 00:55:34,777
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.

664
00:55:35,257 --> 00:55:41,680
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for clarifying.

665
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:43,041
[SPEAKER_11]: While that's happening, can I just?

666
00:55:43,421 --> 00:55:43,681
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

667
00:55:43,721 --> 00:55:44,261
[SPEAKER_10]: Go ahead, Andre.

668
00:55:44,321 --> 00:55:47,042
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I would suggest.

669
00:55:48,729 --> 00:55:54,775
[SPEAKER_11]: The conditions in terms of hours, we could set maybe like an 8 a.m.

670
00:55:54,835 --> 00:55:55,956
[SPEAKER_11]: to 7 p.m.

671
00:55:55,976 --> 00:56:01,481
[SPEAKER_11]: and maximum like 10 appointments per day, two days a week.

672
00:56:01,982 --> 00:56:09,049
[SPEAKER_11]: That way there's an opportunity to be a little bit flexible, but nothing outside of what the parking permits allow.

673
00:56:13,101 --> 00:56:13,401
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

674
00:56:13,922 --> 00:56:16,162
[SPEAKER_11]: And in terms of this, it is a corner lot.

675
00:56:16,182 --> 00:56:23,624
[SPEAKER_11]: There's plenty of on-street parking for a couple, like a car or two, in front of their own property.

676
00:56:23,664 --> 00:56:26,645
[SPEAKER_11]: So I don't have a problem with any of that.

677
00:56:26,665 --> 00:56:33,627
[SPEAKER_10]: Other thoughts from the board?

678
00:56:39,769 --> 00:56:40,329
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Dennis.

679
00:56:46,310 --> 00:56:58,274
[SPEAKER_09]: So I definitely think it's important to include in any special permit some details on hours of operation and so on.

680
00:56:58,354 --> 00:57:05,236
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's no off-street parking proposed.

681
00:57:05,416 --> 00:57:12,239
[SPEAKER_09]: So if we were to impose that condition, it would impact the plans as presented.

682
00:57:15,115 --> 00:57:27,339
[SPEAKER_09]: So the hours of operation, I'm of the opinion we should really speak to the operating hours and the operating days.

683
00:57:27,679 --> 00:57:31,320
[SPEAKER_09]: Otherwise, it's really hard to enforce.

684
00:57:32,001 --> 00:57:32,941
[SPEAKER_09]: It's unclear.

685
00:57:32,961 --> 00:57:43,685
[SPEAKER_09]: How would the city know if it was one hour a day split over six days versus six hours over one day?

686
00:57:47,127 --> 00:57:48,528
[SPEAKER_09]: But not a requirement.

687
00:57:48,568 --> 00:57:49,908
[SPEAKER_09]: Just wanted to throw that out there.

688
00:57:50,629 --> 00:57:52,209
[SPEAKER_09]: I do agree with Andre.

689
00:57:53,050 --> 00:58:04,194
[SPEAKER_09]: If we're too restrictive with the special permit, it could limit the flexibility for the applicant in a way that's detrimental to the business.

690
00:58:04,274 --> 00:58:10,217
[SPEAKER_09]: So having some buffer in there also makes sense to me.

691
00:58:12,117 --> 00:58:13,538
[SPEAKER_10]: Other thoughts from the board?

692
00:58:16,710 --> 00:58:18,091
[SPEAKER_05]: Chris.

693
00:58:20,552 --> 00:58:27,917
[SPEAKER_05]: He's before us for a special permit because of the zoning district or because of the use?

694
00:58:28,637 --> 00:58:35,361
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's because of the accessory use in this zoning district.

695
00:58:35,482 --> 00:58:42,826
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't recall the exact zoning district, but in residential districts in general,

696
00:58:45,005 --> 00:58:48,146
[SPEAKER_09]: Business uses are substantially restricted.

697
00:58:49,187 --> 00:58:53,748
[SPEAKER_09]: And one of the rare exceptions is for home occupations.

698
00:58:54,509 --> 00:58:57,350
[SPEAKER_09]: There's some that are allowed by rights, some that require a special permit.

699
00:58:58,130 --> 00:59:08,774
[SPEAKER_09]: This is an accessory use that does require a special permit for the licensed massage therapy operation.

700
00:59:13,323 --> 00:59:16,844
[SPEAKER_05]: I looked at the zoning and I didn't see why this was even before us.

701
00:59:16,944 --> 00:59:18,905
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's 94.3.4.2 is what's triggering it.

702
00:59:18,925 --> 00:59:22,246
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it seems like that's for employees coming to them.

703
00:59:43,227 --> 01:00:00,578
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so it's a little convoluted, but it's trying to distinguish what you could do without even talking to us versus what needs to talk to us.

704
01:00:00,738 --> 01:00:07,522
[SPEAKER_09]: And so the reason why 94.3.4.1, as of right, doesn't apply is it meets six out of the seven criteria.

705
01:00:12,401 --> 01:00:15,402
[SPEAKER_09]: produces customer or client trips to the location.

706
01:00:17,043 --> 01:00:22,725
[SPEAKER_09]: So because it produces customer or client trips, it triggers the need for a special permit.

707
01:00:23,845 --> 01:00:24,365
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, okay.

708
01:00:24,786 --> 01:00:25,066
[SPEAKER_05]: Got it.

709
01:00:25,286 --> 01:00:25,746
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw that.

710
01:00:26,186 --> 01:00:26,466
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.

711
01:00:27,247 --> 01:00:27,467
Sure.

712
01:00:36,110 --> 01:00:41,452
[SPEAKER_09]: Russell, it sounds like at least some members of the board are considering

713
01:00:42,551 --> 01:00:46,654
[SPEAKER_09]: Approval subject to some conditions on the operating hours.

714
01:00:46,734 --> 01:01:00,824
[SPEAKER_09]: So do you have Like a set of operating hours and days that you're definitely comfortable don't think it's gonna cause any issues for you So you said you're planning to do ten to six on Monday.

715
01:01:01,444 --> 01:01:06,148
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah possibly Friday, I'm taking Fridays off now, but

716
01:01:07,211 --> 01:01:12,074
[SPEAKER_19]: potentially Fridays, but I'm just working four days a week now and I work three days downtown.

717
01:01:12,915 --> 01:01:17,978
[SPEAKER_19]: And just the one day we said would be people outside of the city to make it easier for them.

718
01:01:18,538 --> 01:01:20,720
[SPEAKER_19]: Plus, it's not a bad commute for me either.

719
01:01:20,820 --> 01:01:22,781
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's kind of a bonus.

720
01:01:23,722 --> 01:01:25,423
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, just a curiosity question.

721
01:01:26,384 --> 01:01:34,489
[SPEAKER_09]: When you're on site at your other place of business, what are your typical working hours there?

722
01:01:35,851 --> 01:01:40,973
[SPEAKER_19]: There I'm a little later 1130 to seven, literally just because of the commute.

723
01:01:43,114 --> 01:01:45,435
[SPEAKER_19]: I like to do like a second work late.

724
01:01:46,355 --> 01:01:56,139
[SPEAKER_19]: I actually am a part time musician I have a gig tonight in downtown Boston funeral hall so I don't like to work any later.

725
01:01:59,721 --> 01:02:08,787
[SPEAKER_09]: Thursday, so just something like 9 to 7, 10 to 7 would be plenty of coverage and then Mondays and Fridays would be plenty of day coverage.

726
01:02:09,107 --> 01:02:09,708
[SPEAKER_19]: Absolutely.

727
01:02:13,670 --> 01:02:15,131
[SPEAKER_10]: Other questions or thoughts from the board?

728
01:02:22,544 --> 01:02:25,446
[SPEAKER_19]: I work at a rent space called Joint Ventures.

729
01:02:25,466 --> 01:02:26,827
[SPEAKER_19]: They have about 10 locations.

730
01:02:27,307 --> 01:02:35,933
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm at their downtown crossing for Water Street location, three days, end day there just because I want to take the day off.

731
01:02:38,615 --> 01:02:44,398
[SPEAKER_19]: And like I said, it's just, it would be great to get for people that are coming in from out of town.

732
01:02:45,199 --> 01:02:47,000
[SPEAKER_19]: And I have a lot of clients that are doing that.

733
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:50,883
[SPEAKER_11]: Andre, go ahead.

734
01:02:52,912 --> 01:02:59,694
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to approve the special permit with the condition of operating hours between 9 a.m.

735
01:03:00,774 --> 01:03:01,775
[SPEAKER_11]: and 7 p.m.

736
01:03:01,875 --> 01:03:02,895
[SPEAKER_11]: on Mondays and Fridays.

737
01:03:04,736 --> 01:03:05,576
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll give it a second.

738
01:03:05,796 --> 01:03:06,416
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll second.

739
01:03:07,336 --> 01:03:09,857
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to take a roll call.

740
01:03:09,937 --> 01:03:10,257
[SPEAKER_09]: Yvette?

741
01:03:11,458 --> 01:03:11,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

742
01:03:12,618 --> 01:03:13,118
[SPEAKER_09]: Gary?

743
01:03:13,898 --> 01:03:14,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

744
01:03:14,939 --> 01:03:15,319
[SPEAKER_09]: Chris?

745
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:18,380
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

746
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:19,420
[SPEAKER_09]: Jim?

747
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:20,380
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

748
01:03:21,281 --> 01:03:21,641
[SPEAKER_09]: Andre?

749
01:03:22,261 --> 01:03:22,341
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

750
01:03:23,068 --> 01:03:25,249
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, this control permit is approved.

751
01:03:25,309 --> 01:03:28,170
[SPEAKER_09]: So one step along the way, Russell.

752
01:03:28,230 --> 01:03:28,970
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you very much.

753
01:03:28,990 --> 01:03:30,210
[SPEAKER_19]: I really appreciate your time.

754
01:03:30,571 --> 01:03:32,211
[SPEAKER_19]: How do I go about getting the license now?

755
01:03:32,251 --> 01:03:33,492
[SPEAKER_19]: Do I go see Dennis or?

756
01:03:33,512 --> 01:03:34,992
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

757
01:03:35,192 --> 01:03:36,012
[SPEAKER_18]: So yeah, Russ.

758
01:03:36,052 --> 01:03:45,436
[SPEAKER_18]: So I have to write up the permit, I mean, the decision, and then it gets checked by legal and then it gets signed by the members and then it gets filed in the clerk's office.

759
01:03:46,056 --> 01:03:47,977
[SPEAKER_18]: At that point, it starts the 20 day clock.

760
01:03:48,537 --> 01:03:48,877
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

761
01:03:49,813 --> 01:03:50,894
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, from that point.

762
01:03:50,914 --> 01:03:55,157
[SPEAKER_18]: So I would say probably in the, I haven't done one of these types of decisions before.

763
01:03:55,217 --> 01:03:57,438
[SPEAKER_18]: So sometimes I can bang them out very quickly.

764
01:03:57,478 --> 01:04:09,706
[SPEAKER_18]: This one I think might, I might need to talk to legal a little bit more on it, but a month and a half, give or take, you know, the meeting to when you've got your, whatever, whatever gets filed in the clerk's office, I'll let you know.

765
01:04:09,746 --> 01:04:11,467
[SPEAKER_18]: And that starts the 20 day clock.

766
01:04:11,487 --> 01:04:15,729
[SPEAKER_18]: And then once 20 days are over, as long as there's no appeal, then you go and you get your permit.

767
01:04:16,230 --> 01:04:16,530
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

768
01:04:16,973 --> 01:04:18,173
[SPEAKER_19]: I really appreciate your time.

769
01:04:18,233 --> 01:04:19,274
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you all for your time.

770
01:04:19,534 --> 01:04:20,874
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a big help.

771
01:04:20,914 --> 01:04:21,294
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

772
01:04:21,314 --> 01:04:22,515
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

773
01:04:23,355 --> 01:04:24,115
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

774
01:04:24,495 --> 01:04:24,896
[SPEAKER_05]: Take care.

775
01:04:27,396 --> 01:04:28,377
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

776
01:04:29,017 --> 01:04:30,797
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that our last case, Dennis?

777
01:04:32,218 --> 01:04:33,958
[SPEAKER_09]: It is.

778
01:04:33,978 --> 01:04:34,018
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

779
01:04:34,038 --> 01:04:36,099
[SPEAKER_09]: So next we have administrative updates.

780
01:04:36,119 --> 01:04:36,539
[SPEAKER_18]: Is that right?

781
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:44,902
[SPEAKER_18]: Administrative updates, I sort of give you the only, hopefully, as I sort of said, we should have

782
01:04:46,157 --> 01:05:15,130
[SPEAKER_18]: a the full complement members by our next meeting um and i'm trying to think of anything internally anything no nothing nothing major i don't think from our end uh you know just the normal compiling is coming through so um should have i mean may will be i think there's like four well five now with the one continued i think i think that's what our numbers are looking for for uh for may

783
01:05:16,843 --> 01:05:17,763
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

784
01:05:17,883 --> 01:05:26,447
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, Dennis, I know you suggested we have a discussion of potential meeting minute formats today.

785
01:05:26,627 --> 01:05:33,590
[SPEAKER_09]: And so you sent over two versions of meeting minutes for the board's review.

786
01:05:33,650 --> 01:05:35,211
[SPEAKER_09]: I have had a chance to look at them.

787
01:05:35,351 --> 01:05:36,472
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah.

788
01:05:37,992 --> 01:05:39,413
[SPEAKER_09]: How do you want to go about this?

789
01:05:39,453 --> 01:05:41,054
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you want to share some details on it?

790
01:05:41,074 --> 01:05:43,875
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm just sort of giving my sort of initial thoughts.

791
01:05:45,152 --> 01:05:47,233
[SPEAKER_18]: part of me kind of likes a little bit of both.

792
01:05:47,653 --> 01:05:59,898
[SPEAKER_18]: So I was trying to do something actually after I sent, before I sent them off to you, one of my missions was to try to use the program to sort of combine the best of both worlds in these, see if it could do it itself.

793
01:05:59,938 --> 01:06:09,962
[SPEAKER_18]: And it couldn't, but I do kind of, and looking at the one that's just the summary format, I think that's actually pretty solid in terms of, you know,

794
01:06:10,711 --> 01:06:16,993
[SPEAKER_18]: The nuts and bolts of the feeling of the meeting, but then the meeting minutes has a good thing of all the participants, the agenda items, things like that.

795
01:06:17,074 --> 01:06:17,294
[SPEAKER_18]: So.

796
01:06:18,934 --> 01:06:22,316
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, but I kind of wanted to sort of sound your opinions on that as well.

797
01:06:23,016 --> 01:06:26,297
[SPEAKER_18]: And I mean, I think it'd be a relatively straightforward thing.

798
01:06:26,337 --> 01:06:27,278
[SPEAKER_18]: I might have to do some, you know.

799
01:06:27,958 --> 01:06:38,122
[SPEAKER_18]: Formatting just to try to figure things out, but like, you know, the, the 1st part of the meeting minutes, 1 that sort of list, you know, date, time, participants, agenda items, things like that.

800
01:06:38,182 --> 01:06:38,442
[SPEAKER_18]: And then.

801
01:06:39,273 --> 01:06:48,923
[SPEAKER_18]: sort of go into, whereas they have discussion points, then I can just sort of go into the summary part and sort of move those over to there.

802
01:06:50,045 --> 01:07:01,377
[SPEAKER_09]: So, Dennis, one question I have, so the software you're using to generate what you then modified for errors, does that

803
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:10,466
[SPEAKER_09]: allow you to supply a prompt or is it basically just here's a video and then I've made some selections and I just spit something out?

804
01:07:11,827 --> 01:07:31,141
[SPEAKER_18]: Basically you can you can try and sort of tweak it and ask for things and some of them come out okay like you can say I want to focus more on like for the summary like I want you know you can say I want a summary based on you know this and it's it's not great like I sort of found that it's they have like

805
01:07:33,266 --> 01:07:36,328
[SPEAKER_18]: 20 different types of outputs that they have just general ones.

806
01:07:36,969 --> 01:07:40,931
[SPEAKER_18]: So I went through last week, I went through every single one of them and he sent you the three best.

807
01:07:41,391 --> 01:07:41,672
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

808
01:07:42,472 --> 01:07:44,653
[SPEAKER_18]: So, and those were the ones that I sent you.

809
01:07:44,714 --> 01:07:55,240
[SPEAKER_09]: So my curiosity is mostly like, I'll just for the sake of this discussion, call them, um, summary styles.

810
01:07:55,781 --> 01:07:59,283
[SPEAKER_09]: So could you like, let's say the, based on discussion,

811
01:08:00,547 --> 01:08:16,379
[SPEAKER_09]: the board decides, hey, we really like format A the most, but we share your assessment that it's really important to list details about the meeting and its attendees and the agenda items.

812
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:28,349
[SPEAKER_09]: Could you say something like, here's the agenda for the meeting, this video's out, and I really want

813
01:08:29,290 --> 01:08:46,445
[SPEAKER_09]: Summary in style a but please make sure to list details about the meeting and all the attendees and all the agenda items like the support something like that or I believe so so that's when you know Teresa from our office and myself.

814
01:08:46,485 --> 01:08:52,471
[SPEAKER_18]: We've been the two who've been kind of test test driving this program sort of you know, and I

815
01:08:53,639 --> 01:08:58,361
[SPEAKER_18]: I was, unfortunately, I was trying to get in touch with her today, and we were kind of crossing paths.

816
01:08:58,381 --> 01:09:00,762
[SPEAKER_18]: So I never tried to rush home for something.

817
01:09:01,082 --> 01:09:02,302
[SPEAKER_18]: So I was kind of out of the office for a bit.

818
01:09:02,583 --> 01:09:08,085
[SPEAKER_18]: But yeah, I can sort of looking at what the program can do.

819
01:09:08,785 --> 01:09:13,007
[SPEAKER_18]: It is just trying to be exactly where I have it.

820
01:09:15,868 --> 01:09:21,550
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's actually I can sort of if you want, I'll just let me just sort of do the screen share.

821
01:09:22,644 --> 01:09:29,208
[SPEAKER_18]: sort of show you what it sort of looks like, just to give you a better idea.

822
01:09:37,033 --> 01:09:38,113
[SPEAKER_18]: So basically, this is a recording.

823
01:09:38,153 --> 01:09:41,856
[SPEAKER_18]: And then first thing it does is, you know, it does like a basic summary and then the transcript.

824
01:09:41,896 --> 01:09:47,159
[SPEAKER_18]: And then, like here at the templates, I can ask for all of these types of...

825
01:09:50,494 --> 01:09:53,337
[SPEAKER_18]: And sort of looking at it, I kind of agree with what you're saying.

826
01:09:53,717 --> 01:10:03,806
[SPEAKER_18]: I think there is a way, I just am not, I may actually know a better way to basically, that's what I was sort of trying to do, was trying to get the best of both, almost the best of both worlds format between the two.

827
01:10:04,387 --> 01:10:16,718
[SPEAKER_18]: And it should be my understanding of the software is that that's doable to say, like, I want, you gotta be very precise about what you're asking for, but I think I can kind of nail down the language and then get one which is sort of,

828
01:10:17,979 --> 01:10:24,467
[SPEAKER_09]: As I sort of reading myself the best of both worlds, so okay cool that answers my question looks like Andre has a question

829
01:10:26,693 --> 01:10:29,954
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, yeah, I have, I guess, a question and a comment.

830
01:10:30,314 --> 01:10:33,035
[SPEAKER_11]: So the comment is about the format.

831
01:10:33,355 --> 01:10:44,919
[SPEAKER_11]: I liked the summary for the discussion narrative, and I liked the meeting minutes for kind of everything else, because that was the agenda.

832
01:10:44,959 --> 01:10:46,839
[SPEAKER_11]: From what you were saying, Dennis, I agree with you.

833
01:10:46,859 --> 01:10:48,480
[SPEAKER_11]: I would just take, like, that

834
01:10:48,980 --> 01:10:52,402
[SPEAKER_11]: summary discussion and inserted the deliberation part.

835
01:10:54,024 --> 01:10:57,226
[SPEAKER_11]: The question that I have is really a legal one.

836
01:10:57,706 --> 01:11:07,293
[SPEAKER_11]: So if there is an appeal of any of our decisions or question about like what we talked about, is that summary enough detail?

837
01:11:07,913 --> 01:11:10,694
[SPEAKER_11]: that we would be able to, that'd be useful to us.

838
01:11:10,994 --> 01:11:15,896
[SPEAKER_11]: Now I see in here you shared your screen and it has, do we keep those transcripts so we could go back to that?

839
01:11:16,016 --> 01:11:19,197
[SPEAKER_11]: Or is it only, do we have to rely on the meeting minutes?

840
01:11:19,277 --> 01:11:26,599
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I didn't think they were, I didn't think either format would be detailed enough to be able to handle a court case.

841
01:11:28,260 --> 01:11:28,800
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll be honest.

842
01:11:28,980 --> 01:11:37,643
[SPEAKER_18]: I went and looked at other communities meeting minutes for other zoning boards and most of them are just one pages with basically says here was the meeting.

843
01:11:38,729 --> 01:11:39,889
[SPEAKER_18]: and approved or denied.

844
01:11:39,909 --> 01:11:43,310
[SPEAKER_18]: They're very, so I, okay.

845
01:11:43,330 --> 01:11:44,511
[SPEAKER_18]: I am trying.

846
01:11:44,631 --> 01:11:44,871
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

847
01:11:44,911 --> 01:11:49,632
[SPEAKER_18]: So I, I've sort of, and then talking to like other, you know, sort of like it's there.

848
01:11:49,912 --> 01:11:57,794
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, you'd be literally some of them, some of them just take the agenda and then just cut and paste, like in literally the decision and, you know, do it that way.

849
01:11:57,834 --> 01:12:00,395
[SPEAKER_18]: And then it's very, so, um,

850
01:12:01,272 --> 01:12:03,354
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, but I have, we have all the recordings on tape.

851
01:12:03,374 --> 01:12:06,417
[SPEAKER_18]: So if we did want to generate the transcript, we can do it instantly with this.

852
01:12:06,457 --> 01:12:07,858
[SPEAKER_18]: So what happens in the case?

853
01:12:07,898 --> 01:12:13,003
[SPEAKER_18]: So we will just for an example, the, uh, the most recent appeal, the one on canal street.

854
01:12:13,924 --> 01:12:17,747
[SPEAKER_18]: So I basically submitted my meeting minutes to them.

855
01:12:18,067 --> 01:12:22,311
[SPEAKER_18]: And then I also provided them with the video of the meeting, which we have.

856
01:12:22,331 --> 01:12:25,174
[SPEAKER_18]: So sort of let them sort of go for it that way, if they want to.

857
01:12:26,658 --> 01:12:27,219
[SPEAKER_18]: do it that way.

858
01:12:27,259 --> 01:12:37,769
[SPEAKER_18]: So, you know, it's like when I first started, I used to record all of our meetings on little tiny cassette tapes and same sort of thing, you know, just sort of have them as a secondary record.

859
01:12:38,850 --> 01:12:49,641
[SPEAKER_18]: But for the meeting minutes themselves, I was pretty stunned when I first saw that, the other ones, because I will say, and this is purely

860
01:12:50,455 --> 01:12:52,977
[SPEAKER_18]: that meeting minutes are the bane of my existence.

861
01:12:53,337 --> 01:13:00,883
[SPEAKER_18]: So finding this, which I think will simplify it is, is, I'm pretty, pretty happy with what's been done with these so far.

862
01:13:01,483 --> 01:13:06,467
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, because I, I don't just staff, I mean, yeah, I staff like a few other boards.

863
01:13:06,547 --> 01:13:09,589
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's getting something like this is, is basically

864
01:13:10,402 --> 01:13:14,571
[SPEAKER_18]: making kind of make, you know, I mean, basically, I'm, you know, constantly working on these are trying to.

865
01:13:14,591 --> 01:13:14,671
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

866
01:13:15,513 --> 01:13:16,154
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I'm good.

867
01:13:16,214 --> 01:13:16,675
[SPEAKER_11]: Go for it.

868
01:13:17,397 --> 01:13:18,159
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

869
01:13:18,579 --> 01:13:21,606
[SPEAKER_09]: Andre, just to add my understanding, Simon,

870
01:13:22,053 --> 01:13:24,155
[SPEAKER_09]: consulted with legal yet.

871
01:13:24,275 --> 01:13:40,089
[SPEAKER_09]: But so in this hypothetical scenario where there's inadequate written documentation and someone sues Discovery, they can basically request the necessary information, which maybe someone would have to testify to.

872
01:13:41,002 --> 01:13:51,771
[SPEAKER_09]: In Medford's case with the videos, the video basically does capture everything of relevance in the meeting itself so that it kind of guards against that.

873
01:13:52,371 --> 01:13:58,697
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that probably the biggest risk in using AI summaries for meeting minutes is in

874
01:14:03,146 --> 01:14:05,607
[SPEAKER_09]: The second biggest risk would be egregious omissions.

875
01:14:06,307 --> 01:14:09,408
[SPEAKER_09]: And the biggest risk would be outright falsehoods.

876
01:14:09,448 --> 01:14:11,809
[SPEAKER_09]: It fabricates the reality.

877
01:14:11,829 --> 01:14:18,352
[SPEAKER_09]: And so as a board, we follow a process where we have to approve the meeting minutes.

878
01:14:18,372 --> 01:14:21,873
[SPEAKER_09]: So basically, we would need a process where it's like, here's the format.

879
01:14:23,329 --> 01:14:31,614
[SPEAKER_09]: Someone at the city feeds in the inputs, generates this, has to review every word, just sanity check that there's nothing glaring.

880
01:14:31,974 --> 01:14:35,256
[SPEAKER_09]: Then we as a board read it, check for errors.

881
01:14:35,376 --> 01:14:41,200
[SPEAKER_09]: And then in voting to approve, we're basically saying, hey, the meeting minutes seem accurate.

882
01:14:41,260 --> 01:14:44,082
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's the process we need to follow.

883
01:14:44,982 --> 01:14:49,685
[SPEAKER_09]: I could get an opinion if it's essential to anybody.

884
01:14:52,687 --> 01:14:52,787
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

885
01:14:53,623 --> 01:15:20,616
[SPEAKER_18]: uh... what they are interested in sort of much you can you all can't do this but i'd probably have like a notebook in front of you remember basically writing jotting things down so i'd also use that as well as sort of like a secondary i mean it's it's basically a lot of it's like you know just who did what we were in who spoke of things like that so that also sort of helps and then on a paper that there is any quite if i see something like i'm not sure if that's right i just watched the video mentor together from there but

886
01:15:21,612 --> 01:15:22,972
[SPEAKER_18]: I haven't really noticed anything like that.

887
01:15:23,472 --> 01:15:23,692
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

888
01:15:24,473 --> 01:15:24,753
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

889
01:15:25,533 --> 01:15:29,753
[SPEAKER_09]: My suggestion, Dennis, we can take, um, some of the discussion offline.

890
01:15:29,793 --> 01:15:34,834
[SPEAKER_09]: Like we don't have to discuss this all publicly, but I tend to agree with spoken.

891
01:15:36,355 --> 01:15:41,975
[SPEAKER_09]: Finding some hybrid way to kind of get the best of both of those examples, um, makes the most sense.

892
01:15:42,075 --> 01:15:44,956
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe we can give that a try and take most of this.

893
01:15:46,336 --> 01:15:50,937
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I do want to approve a version of the meeting minutes today.

894
01:15:52,744 --> 01:15:54,484
[SPEAKER_09]: just so that we have one officially.

895
01:15:54,564 --> 01:16:10,672
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I'm of the opinion that the second one, the one that has the details about the attendees and who spoke, even though it would be better augmented with both, that's the one that is closer to a proper meeting minutes.

896
01:16:10,752 --> 01:16:12,993
[SPEAKER_09]: The first one's missing some key details.

897
01:16:13,033 --> 01:16:15,515
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would recommend

898
01:16:16,622 --> 01:16:25,131
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, if the board is willing that we vote on the second set of meetings, the one that has the all the attendees and the agenda and such.

899
01:16:28,955 --> 01:16:29,856
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm fine with that.

900
01:16:30,296 --> 01:16:37,964
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I think I was wondering, Dennis, if there's another like a, if you get versions that you're at least.

901
01:16:39,707 --> 01:16:41,028
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, it works somewhat.

902
01:16:41,828 --> 01:16:49,111
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a way that you can take the two versions and then somehow put them into a another program?

903
01:16:49,131 --> 01:16:50,331
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what I'm sort of hopeful.

904
01:16:51,592 --> 01:16:52,452
[SPEAKER_18]: That's sort of the idea.

905
01:16:52,472 --> 01:16:54,953
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's what I kind of wanted to talk with Teresa with this.

906
01:16:55,373 --> 01:16:59,255
[SPEAKER_18]: I know she's been she's used them for the Preservation Committee.

907
01:16:59,295 --> 01:17:04,417
[SPEAKER_18]: So I, I think that and I think if there's an option within this program to do so I just

908
01:17:05,492 --> 01:17:14,977
[SPEAKER_18]: So I, but I think there, I seem to recall when I was working last week when I was generating these, there was something where I could sort of create my own sort of hybrid for, for output.

909
01:17:15,597 --> 01:17:16,597
[SPEAKER_18]: And so I think that's there.

910
01:17:16,638 --> 01:17:20,139
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just, I think it's going to be a matter of like just getting the tweaking language just right.

911
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:24,701
[SPEAKER_18]: So, and really being specific about what it's looking for, but I think it's doable.

912
01:17:25,682 --> 01:17:25,862
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

913
01:17:26,122 --> 01:17:33,586
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I would, I'd be also curious to know about the legal, you know, um,

914
01:17:34,753 --> 01:17:45,759
[SPEAKER_05]: requirements of what are you know, if we put together something and then give it to legal to look at and say, is that sufficient?

915
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:52,463
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, so here's my recommendation.

916
01:17:53,543 --> 01:17:56,665
[SPEAKER_09]: Dennis, let's you and I started with legal just

917
01:17:57,720 --> 01:18:03,944
[SPEAKER_09]: generally talking about use of AI in generating meeting minutes and procedure and potential.

918
01:18:04,465 --> 01:18:07,687
[SPEAKER_09]: And we can use these meeting minutes as an example.

919
01:18:09,927 --> 01:18:12,668
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I said, we have the guardrail for any given set.

920
01:18:12,768 --> 01:18:15,210
[SPEAKER_09]: Read them, verify their accuracy, and approve them.

921
01:18:15,330 --> 01:18:18,291
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm comfortable approving a set today.

922
01:18:18,311 --> 01:18:25,295
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I can report back to the board, assuming we have a response, the guidance.

923
01:18:25,555 --> 01:18:29,597
[SPEAKER_09]: If needed, we could do an executive session if that would be necessary.

924
01:18:30,637 --> 01:18:31,738
[SPEAKER_09]: Does that sound good?

925
01:18:31,818 --> 01:18:33,359
[SPEAKER_09]: Dennis, could you start that thread with them?

926
01:18:34,676 --> 01:18:35,256
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I'll do that.

927
01:18:35,276 --> 01:18:37,357
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll talk to KB Law tomorrow.

928
01:18:38,037 --> 01:18:38,238
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

929
01:18:38,658 --> 01:18:41,419
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, yeah, I'd like to participate in that discussion.

930
01:18:41,439 --> 01:18:42,919
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, sure.

931
01:18:43,220 --> 01:18:43,420
[SPEAKER_09]: Cool.

932
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:44,400
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, great.

933
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:45,841
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll include you in the email too, Rami.

934
01:18:45,881 --> 01:18:59,006
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, so chair awaits a motion to approve the second set of meeting minutes titled, they have different titles.

935
01:19:00,227 --> 01:19:03,028
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah, the ZBA minutes with a date

936
01:19:03,657 --> 01:19:04,737
[SPEAKER_09]: meeting minutes format.

937
01:19:06,898 --> 01:19:09,239
[SPEAKER_09]: For March 27.

938
01:19:09,619 --> 01:19:11,100
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, for March 27.

939
01:19:11,180 --> 01:19:11,660
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion.

940
01:19:13,481 --> 01:19:15,101
[SPEAKER_09]: Do I have a second?

941
01:19:15,422 --> 01:19:15,842
[SPEAKER_09]: Seconded.

942
01:19:15,862 --> 01:19:18,203
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, I'm going to take a roll call.

943
01:19:18,223 --> 01:19:18,583
[SPEAKER_09]: Yvette?

944
01:19:19,643 --> 01:19:19,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

945
01:19:20,243 --> 01:19:20,584
[SPEAKER_09]: Chris?

946
01:19:21,204 --> 01:19:21,344
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

947
01:19:21,824 --> 01:19:22,304
[SPEAKER_09]: Mary?

948
01:19:22,324 --> 01:19:23,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

949
01:19:23,465 --> 01:19:23,845
[SPEAKER_09]: Jim?

950
01:19:24,345 --> 01:19:24,625
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

951
01:19:25,105 --> 01:19:25,586
[SPEAKER_09]: Andre?

952
01:19:25,606 --> 01:19:26,166
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

953
01:19:26,626 --> 01:19:26,926
[SPEAKER_09]: Mike?

954
01:19:27,826 --> 01:19:27,946
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

955
01:19:28,006 --> 01:19:29,687
[SPEAKER_09]: The meeting minutes are approved.

956
01:19:30,527 --> 01:19:31,928
[SPEAKER_09]: Woohoo, that feels good.

957
01:19:32,878 --> 01:19:33,538
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's do it again.

958
01:19:35,039 --> 01:19:35,339
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

959
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:40,302
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it's just for logistics.

960
01:19:40,402 --> 01:19:43,403
[SPEAKER_04]: I won't be here next month on the 20th.

961
01:19:43,443 --> 01:19:43,744
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

962
01:19:44,624 --> 01:19:45,705
[SPEAKER_18]: I appreciate that.

963
01:19:45,825 --> 01:19:46,245
[SPEAKER_18]: That's good.

964
01:19:47,065 --> 01:19:47,485
[SPEAKER_18]: Good to know.

965
01:19:47,546 --> 01:19:47,846
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

966
01:19:49,086 --> 01:19:49,286
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

967
01:19:49,326 --> 01:19:51,688
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we're at the end of our agenda.

968
01:19:51,788 --> 01:19:55,550
[SPEAKER_09]: So chair awaits a motion to turn motion.

969
01:19:56,590 --> 01:19:56,850
[SPEAKER_09]: Second.

970
01:19:56,870 --> 01:19:57,150
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

971
01:19:57,831 --> 01:19:58,971
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to take a roll call.

972
01:19:59,111 --> 01:19:59,592
[SPEAKER_09]: Andre.

973
01:19:59,612 --> 01:20:01,293
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, Jim.

974
01:20:01,813 --> 01:20:01,973
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi.

975
01:20:02,409 --> 01:20:02,789
[SPEAKER_09]: Mary.

976
01:20:02,809 --> 01:20:03,470
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

977
01:20:03,870 --> 01:20:04,170
[SPEAKER_09]: Chris.

978
01:20:05,111 --> 01:20:05,231
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

979
01:20:05,571 --> 01:20:05,891
[SPEAKER_09]: Yvette.

980
01:20:06,672 --> 01:20:06,812
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

981
01:20:07,312 --> 01:20:07,532
[SPEAKER_09]: Mike.

982
01:20:08,052 --> 01:20:08,193
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

983
01:20:08,593 --> 01:20:09,433
[SPEAKER_09]: We are now adjourned.

984
01:20:10,894 --> 01:20:11,915
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you all very much.

985
01:20:13,176 --> 01:20:14,436
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome Zoning Board of Appeals.

986
01:20:14,476 --> 01:20:17,198
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to take a quick roll call and then we'll get started.

987
01:20:18,579 --> 01:20:19,239
[SPEAKER_09]: Jim Tirani.

988
01:20:19,259 --> 01:20:20,360
[SPEAKER_09]: Present.

989
01:20:21,301 --> 01:20:21,981
[SPEAKER_09]: Mary Lee.

990
01:20:22,541 --> 01:20:22,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Present.

991
01:20:24,002 --> 01:20:24,723
[SPEAKER_09]: Andre LaRue.

992
01:20:25,423 --> 01:20:25,783
[SPEAKER_09]: Present.

993
01:20:27,364 --> 01:20:31,407
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't believe we have Christy Yvette yet.

994
01:20:32,660 --> 01:20:36,822
[SPEAKER_09]: Mike Caldera and Yvette Velez will not be joining.

995
01:20:37,382 --> 01:20:38,382
[SPEAKER_09]: Mike Caldera present.

996
01:20:38,542 --> 01:20:40,143
[SPEAKER_09]: So we've got quorum.

997
01:20:40,203 --> 01:20:40,903
[SPEAKER_09]: We have four.

998
01:20:41,824 --> 01:20:45,645
[SPEAKER_09]: If Chris joins, we'll be up to five, which is our full voting capacity.

999
01:20:45,745 --> 01:20:47,746
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll go ahead and get started.

1000
01:20:48,306 --> 01:20:49,427
[SPEAKER_09]: Dennis, can you please kick us off?

1001
01:20:50,047 --> 01:20:50,267
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

1002
01:20:50,427 --> 01:20:54,709
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're actually going to jump a little bit around on the order.

1003
01:20:54,929 --> 01:20:58,210
[SPEAKER_18]: And we're just going to 77 Shepard Road.

1004
01:20:58,270 --> 01:20:59,931
[SPEAKER_18]: The applicants are going to be asking for continuance.

1005
01:21:00,921 --> 01:21:02,462
[SPEAKER_09]: So then it's just double checking.

1006
01:21:02,482 --> 01:21:07,305
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have to do the intro blurb about the virtual meeting anymore?

1007
01:21:07,665 --> 01:21:08,926
[SPEAKER_18]: No, no, we received word.

1008
01:21:08,946 --> 01:21:11,107
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't have to state that anymore.

1009
01:21:12,228 --> 01:21:12,908
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, awesome.

1010
01:21:12,988 --> 01:21:16,310
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's take Shepard Road out of order then.

1011
01:21:17,131 --> 01:21:18,232
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you read that one please?

1012
01:21:18,552 --> 01:21:18,672
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1013
01:21:22,439 --> 01:21:24,240
[SPEAKER_18]: 77 Shepard Road case number 8-2025-08.

1014
01:21:24,340 --> 01:21:45,074
[SPEAKER_18]: Applicant and owner Christian and Joseph Paradiso to maintain a hot tub classified as a swimming pool at 77 Shepard Road in a single family one zoning district allowed use with insufficient setback from the rear lot line for the City of Medford zoning ordinance chapter 94-4.3.2 for dimensional requirements for accessory structures location of accessory structure.

1015
01:21:46,595 --> 01:21:53,817
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, and so Dennis, you said you got a request in writing from the applicant to- It was a verbal request, but they're on the call right now.

1016
01:21:54,097 --> 01:21:55,077
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, verbal request.

1017
01:21:55,357 --> 01:21:55,557
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1018
01:21:56,757 --> 01:22:01,198
[SPEAKER_09]: Applicant, would you like to say anything before the board votes on the requested continuance?

1019
01:22:02,258 --> 01:22:02,538
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1020
01:22:02,939 --> 01:22:03,719
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Mr. Chair.

1021
01:22:04,939 --> 01:22:09,600
[SPEAKER_21]: Our neighbor evidently has retained counsel, and we just received his lawyer's letter.

1022
01:22:10,625 --> 01:22:16,469
[SPEAKER_21]: this afternoon only a handful of hours with no time at all to review it so we can properly address what's there and review it.

1023
01:22:18,591 --> 01:22:20,032
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, thank you.

1024
01:22:20,532 --> 01:22:22,534
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, the board hasn't heard any evidence.

1025
01:22:22,554 --> 01:22:26,377
[SPEAKER_09]: Customarily, we'll grant continuances when requested.

1026
01:22:26,517 --> 01:22:32,101
[SPEAKER_09]: So chair awaits a motion to continue this matter to our next regular meeting.

1027
01:22:32,121 --> 01:22:32,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1028
01:22:35,103 --> 01:22:35,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion.

1029
01:22:35,463 --> 01:22:37,164
[SPEAKER_09]: Do I have a second?

1030
01:22:37,525 --> 01:22:37,865
[SPEAKER_09]: Second.

1031
01:22:38,633 --> 01:22:40,534
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, we're going to take a roll call vote.

1032
01:22:40,854 --> 01:22:41,175
[SPEAKER_09]: Jim?

1033
01:22:41,855 --> 01:22:42,035
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

1034
01:22:42,515 --> 01:22:42,916
[SPEAKER_09]: Mary?

1035
01:22:42,936 --> 01:22:43,756
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

1036
01:22:44,797 --> 01:22:45,197
[SPEAKER_09]: Andre?

1037
01:22:45,217 --> 01:22:45,877
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

1038
01:22:46,858 --> 01:22:47,318
[SPEAKER_09]: Chris?

1039
01:22:48,759 --> 01:22:48,899
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

1040
01:22:49,980 --> 01:22:50,240
[SPEAKER_09]: Mike?

1041
01:22:50,540 --> 01:22:50,640
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

1042
01:22:50,980 --> 01:22:58,205
[SPEAKER_09]: This matter is continued to our next regular meeting, which Dennis, um, April 24th, April 24th.

1043
01:22:58,305 --> 01:22:58,865
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1044
01:22:59,305 --> 01:22:59,786
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks folks.

1045
01:23:00,106 --> 01:23:03,388
[SPEAKER_18]: With the exact same information that we use for the meeting tonight.

1046
01:23:03,408 --> 01:23:04,228
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1047
01:23:09,593 --> 01:23:10,493
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, what's next?

1048
01:23:11,654 --> 01:23:15,695
[SPEAKER_18]: 640 Boston Avenue, case number A-2025-06.

1049
01:23:16,335 --> 01:23:27,618
[SPEAKER_18]: Applicant and owner Sphere Residential to convert a retail space 640 Boston Avenue into a one-bedroom apartment requiring an amendment to a condition of a variance granted by the Medford Zoning Board, case number A-2015-17.

1050
01:23:27,738 --> 01:23:31,439
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, thank you.

1051
01:23:31,459 --> 01:23:33,120
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have a representative for the applicant?

1052
01:23:34,109 --> 01:23:35,049
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, good evening.

1053
01:23:35,089 --> 01:23:36,530
[SPEAKER_12]: This is attorney Ann Vigarito.

1054
01:23:36,550 --> 01:23:38,530
[SPEAKER_12]: I am the attorney for the applicant.

1055
01:23:38,750 --> 01:23:49,554
[SPEAKER_12]: And as Dennis stated, we're here to request an amendment to a condition of a variance that was granted by the Senate Board back in 2015.

1056
01:23:51,334 --> 01:23:55,215
[SPEAKER_12]: I have a brief introduction and I'll introduce my team.

1057
01:23:55,235 --> 01:23:58,997
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't anticipate this taking very long.

1058
01:23:59,097 --> 01:24:02,998
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, and then we'd hand it off to the board for questions and so forth.

1059
01:24:04,948 --> 01:24:12,232
[SPEAKER_12]: So once again, my team, Eric Wyatt from Amana Emma Architects, he's our architect this evening.

1060
01:24:12,252 --> 01:24:19,416
[SPEAKER_12]: Paul Spivak, he is the building property manager for Sphere, so for this particular building at 640 Boston Avenue.

1061
01:24:19,776 --> 01:24:21,037
[SPEAKER_12]: He will have a few remarks.

1062
01:24:21,377 --> 01:24:27,280
[SPEAKER_12]: Just a brief background, 640 Boston Avenue, I'm assuming you may or may not be familiar with the building.

1063
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:33,465
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's 42 residential units and then the one commercial space that we'll hear about this evening.

1064
01:24:34,346 --> 01:24:45,314
[SPEAKER_12]: It is right next to an MBTA station, right on the edge of Ball Square, Somerville, so it's a very vibrant area.

1065
01:24:47,516 --> 01:24:50,057
[SPEAKER_12]: They received their certificate of occupancy back in 2017.

1066
01:24:50,698 --> 01:24:54,359
[SPEAKER_12]: And at that time, they did not get a commercial tenant.

1067
01:24:54,399 --> 01:24:57,561
[SPEAKER_12]: They finally got a commercial tenant in early 2020.

1068
01:24:57,761 --> 01:25:03,183
[SPEAKER_12]: It was a convenience store, last about eight months.

1069
01:25:03,503 --> 01:25:09,446
[SPEAKER_12]: Some of it may have been COVID, but there's also a convenience store around the corner on Broadway in Somerville.

1070
01:25:11,367 --> 01:25:16,129
[SPEAKER_12]: And since that time, they've not had another viable resident of commercial tenant for the site.

1071
01:25:16,829 --> 01:25:20,673
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a huge, you know, for lease sign in the window.

1072
01:25:20,693 --> 01:25:25,478
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, they've advertised really to no avail.

1073
01:25:27,937 --> 01:25:36,000
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, we do have a housing shortage and, you know, at this juncture, it would make a lot of sense to make this a residential unit.

1074
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:38,781
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, it would be a first floor unit.

1075
01:25:39,221 --> 01:25:42,802
[SPEAKER_12]: A lot of people look for that type of spacing.

1076
01:25:42,822 --> 01:25:44,522
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, they like to be on a first level.

1077
01:25:44,562 --> 01:25:46,243
[SPEAKER_12]: They don't want to get on an elevator.

1078
01:25:46,263 --> 01:25:52,525
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just, you know, they've had inquiries that people would, you know, wonder, would it be residential?

1079
01:25:54,306 --> 01:25:57,229
[SPEAKER_12]: I did submit some letters of support from tenants in the building.

1080
01:25:57,709 --> 01:26:10,921
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, some of the commercial property owners sent in letters, Soundbites, Ball Square Cafe, the owner of the Lindells building,

1081
01:26:12,081 --> 01:26:14,602
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, they would like to see more residential units.

1082
01:26:14,682 --> 01:26:17,904
[SPEAKER_12]: It just adds to the vibrancy of the area.

1083
01:26:18,544 --> 01:26:25,947
[SPEAKER_12]: So at this time, you know, this would be a small one-bedroom unit.

1084
01:26:25,987 --> 01:26:28,908
[SPEAKER_12]: It would be a 700-square-foot one-bedroom.

1085
01:26:30,489 --> 01:26:33,430
[SPEAKER_12]: As a commercial space, it did have two parking spaces.

1086
01:26:35,491 --> 01:26:42,938
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a one bedroom and our anticipation is it would only need one parking space so they would have an extra parking space on the site.

1087
01:26:42,958 --> 01:26:53,627
[SPEAKER_12]: Tenants but you know a lot of times concerns are you're going to take away you know on street parking off street you know on street parking and so forth so there will be none you know happening.

1088
01:26:55,107 --> 01:27:00,209
[SPEAKER_12]: It really should be a good positive asset to the neighborhood.

1089
01:27:00,710 --> 01:27:03,731
[SPEAKER_12]: But I'm going to pass off to Paul Spivak.

1090
01:27:03,751 --> 01:27:04,891
[SPEAKER_12]: He's the property manager.

1091
01:27:05,371 --> 01:27:15,515
[SPEAKER_12]: And then Eric will go through a few slides of the building and what the actual, you know, you will look like as it will be designed as a residential unit.

1092
01:27:16,035 --> 01:27:20,337
[SPEAKER_12]: I will mute myself and Paul, if you could unmute and give your remarks.

1093
01:27:20,417 --> 01:27:20,757
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1094
01:27:22,027 --> 01:27:22,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Anne.

1095
01:27:23,468 --> 01:27:27,690
[SPEAKER_02]: As Anne said, I've been the property manager since the building opened in 2017.

1096
01:27:27,830 --> 01:27:32,852
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's a great, great building, great tenants.

1097
01:27:32,872 --> 01:27:36,073
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we have a very diverse group of tenants.

1098
01:27:36,654 --> 01:27:41,516
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of them are graduate, undergrads, graduate students.

1099
01:27:41,576 --> 01:27:48,719
[SPEAKER_02]: We have some professionals, some retirees, so a really, really nice mix of and diverse group of residents.

1100
01:27:49,899 --> 01:27:52,380
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of them stopped me quite a bit.

1101
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:53,761
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going on with that space?

1102
01:27:53,781 --> 01:27:58,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Why can't you guys seem to get a retail space in there?

1103
01:27:59,484 --> 01:28:05,607
[SPEAKER_02]: They said, look, if you can't get a retail space, they thought it would be great to have a one-bedroom apartment there.

1104
01:28:06,747 --> 01:28:07,788
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to agree with them there.

1105
01:28:08,648 --> 01:28:12,610
[SPEAKER_02]: Had the original owners known what a struggle it's been to get,

1106
01:28:14,092 --> 01:28:16,314
[SPEAKER_02]: a retail tenant in there.

1107
01:28:16,334 --> 01:28:21,317
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure they would have loved to have, you know, taken this with a one bedroom apartment as well.

1108
01:28:22,257 --> 01:28:25,939
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen the struggle from when we first opened.

1109
01:28:25,999 --> 01:28:29,802
[SPEAKER_02]: It took us, you know, a couple years just to find the convenience store.

1110
01:28:29,822 --> 01:28:35,085
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, their thoughts were they're going to have a lot of, excuse me,

1111
01:28:35,868 --> 01:28:39,269
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, foot traffic coming off of the new ball square station.

1112
01:28:39,289 --> 01:28:49,512
[SPEAKER_02]: And unfortunately, you know, most of that foot traffic seems to walk over to the down Broadway and then the foot traffic never really transpired by sphere.

1113
01:28:49,532 --> 01:28:54,274
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and that plus due to covid, they just, you know, they just went out of business.

1114
01:28:55,112 --> 01:28:58,715
[SPEAKER_02]: And ever since then, we've been looking for somebody to no avail.

1115
01:28:59,176 --> 01:29:08,904
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, it's just kind of a sore spot to have such a, what we built ourselves as a luxury building, to have a vacant space in there.

1116
01:29:08,924 --> 01:29:20,434
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it'd be just a great addition to have a beautiful one-bedroom apartment there, bring more business to the area, and just an all-around great opportunity for the community.

1117
01:29:24,262 --> 01:29:27,864
[SPEAKER_08]: I can jump in here and just have a handful of slides.

1118
01:29:27,905 --> 01:29:29,946
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, my name is Eric Lyons.

1119
01:29:30,186 --> 01:29:34,209
[SPEAKER_08]: I am a design principal of architects in Boston.

1120
01:29:34,229 --> 01:29:36,971
[SPEAKER_08]: I assume everybody can see my screen okay.

1121
01:29:37,651 --> 01:29:45,216
[SPEAKER_08]: Much of this has already been said, but just to recap, again, the building was permitted and constructed back in 2016-17.

1122
01:29:47,838 --> 01:29:51,780
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a five-story building with 42 rental apartments.

1123
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:55,642
[SPEAKER_08]: Primarily the apartments are on levels 2, 3, 4, and 5.

1124
01:29:56,783 --> 01:30:05,908
[SPEAKER_08]: The ground floor is lobby space and amenity space and then you can see here in this dashed yellow line that corner which was

1125
01:30:06,948 --> 01:30:14,674
[SPEAKER_08]: plan to be an active use retail space which is really struggled and is essentially a kind of dark corner of the building.

1126
01:30:15,654 --> 01:30:23,000
[SPEAKER_08]: It's about 700 square feet in size and as Anne mentioned there's 44 parking spaces on site.

1127
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:26,863
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a curb cut down at the far end of the site and then one at the kind of

1128
01:30:27,283 --> 01:30:33,845
[SPEAKER_08]: foreground here in this image and all the parking is at grade at the rear of the site on stilts on the back side.

1129
01:30:33,865 --> 01:30:38,267
[SPEAKER_08]: So some of the cars actually tuck underneath the building.

1130
01:30:39,587 --> 01:30:47,510
[SPEAKER_08]: From an urban design part to see why this space has kind of suffered and really failed as a retail location.

1131
01:30:47,750 --> 01:30:51,732
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the building here located or highlighted in this blue line.

1132
01:30:52,712 --> 01:31:01,836
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, when you look at the character of the street and the adjacent parallel streets, they really are residential-centric.

1133
01:31:01,956 --> 01:31:11,461
[SPEAKER_08]: And to assume that people are going to walk up Boston Ave from Broadway to a small retail space is kind of asking a lot of people.

1134
01:31:11,901 --> 01:31:17,003
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the primary retail thoroughfare, obviously, connecting across to the T-Stop.

1135
01:31:17,283 --> 01:31:18,704
[SPEAKER_08]: And really, this is where the

1136
01:31:19,364 --> 01:31:28,248
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, the main activity occurs and likely should have occurred and probably didn't make sense to propose that as retail beginning of the project.

1137
01:31:28,668 --> 01:31:33,070
[SPEAKER_08]: I was not the architect for the record of this conversion proposal.

1138
01:31:34,411 --> 01:31:36,892
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is what this site looks like today.

1139
01:31:36,972 --> 01:31:39,513
[SPEAKER_08]: As Anne mentioned, there's kind of a big banner in the

1140
01:31:40,813 --> 01:31:57,580
[SPEAKER_08]: Storefront looking for tenants and as Paul mentioned, there really has been no activity on the leasing front and it's really a shame because this corner of the building could be much more active, have eyes on the street and kind of provide some good to the public realm.

1141
01:32:01,129 --> 01:32:03,829
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a picture of what the inside looks like.

1142
01:32:03,869 --> 01:32:11,051
[SPEAKER_08]: There's still some of the old countertop and shelving where your snicker bars and candy would have been displayed from the store.

1143
01:32:11,071 --> 01:32:14,351
[SPEAKER_08]: It has great visibility out to the street.

1144
01:32:14,991 --> 01:32:20,292
[SPEAKER_08]: The bottom panes of the glass are kind of frosted in the storefront from this level.

1145
01:32:20,392 --> 01:32:21,032
[SPEAKER_08]: It's clear.

1146
01:32:21,873 --> 01:32:25,973
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't propose using the existing double doors as a main entry.

1147
01:32:26,033 --> 01:32:29,394
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to use the primary entry lobby

1148
01:32:30,854 --> 01:32:33,317
[SPEAKER_08]: as the main circulation to access this unit.

1149
01:32:33,337 --> 01:32:35,319
[SPEAKER_08]: I can show you that in a second in the plan.

1150
01:32:37,261 --> 01:32:47,813
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a site plan overview that again shows that surface parking at the side and rear of the site, curb cut here and then one just off the page on the corner.

1151
01:32:48,554 --> 01:32:54,198
[SPEAKER_08]: This blue here is that existing retail proposed one bedroom, one bath apartment.

1152
01:32:54,778 --> 01:32:57,280
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is the current front door to the building.

1153
01:32:57,360 --> 01:32:58,700
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the entrance lobby.

1154
01:32:59,421 --> 01:33:01,082
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a small conference room.

1155
01:33:01,102 --> 01:33:05,105
[SPEAKER_08]: There's some amenity space on the ground floor, fitness room.

1156
01:33:06,786 --> 01:33:12,010
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the backside of the building is primarily back house with bicycle storage.

1157
01:33:12,971 --> 01:33:20,177
[SPEAKER_08]: And as Anne mentioned, from a zoning perspective, there really is a zero proposed change to the parking.

1158
01:33:20,778 --> 01:33:26,542
[SPEAKER_08]: The current zoning requires 1 space per 350 square feet of retail, which would.

1159
01:33:27,523 --> 01:33:39,754
[SPEAKER_08]: required two spaces at 700 square feet and at two spaces per unit for a one bedroom unit that would also require two spaces so no change in the parking demand on the site.

1160
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:57,009
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is the proposed ground floor, as I mentioned, folks will use the hallway connected to from the main entrance lobby, they can pick up their mail and packages, make their way down the hallway into the entry space here.

1161
01:33:57,990 --> 01:34:09,259
[SPEAKER_08]: Across the Boston Ave frontage is primarily the kitchen, living, dining of the apartment, and then tucked around the corner is the bedroom with the bathroom located in the center.

1162
01:34:09,579 --> 01:34:20,848
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the fitness area to the side, so we've located some even the run of kitchen and kitchen cabinets along this edge just to provide a little bit of additional sound mitigation between the two spaces.

1163
01:34:21,868 --> 01:34:28,769
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that's about it, so I'll pass it back to Anne for any closing remarks, and I'll be happy to answer any questions.

1164
01:34:31,750 --> 01:34:32,570
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you once again.

1165
01:34:32,610 --> 01:34:33,190
[SPEAKER_12]: This is Anne.

1166
01:34:34,410 --> 01:34:50,033
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, we're not asking to construct a new building, so I don't want to waste precious time at the boards, but an additional residential unit would be an asset to the neighborhood, especially this, you know, area

1167
01:34:51,194 --> 01:34:58,959
[SPEAKER_12]: Looking at the empty storefront with the four lease sign, it's a nuisance, it's unattractive.

1168
01:35:00,300 --> 01:35:09,006
[SPEAKER_12]: People who live in the building, they'd like to see a residential unit there and quite a bit of neighborhood support for this conversion.

1169
01:35:09,186 --> 01:35:13,449
[SPEAKER_12]: I would respectfully request that the board would vote in favor of this amendment.

1170
01:35:14,811 --> 01:35:22,540
[SPEAKER_12]: But we're here, you know, any questions you have, please feel free at this time, whatever we can answer, you know, we will thank you so much for your time.

1171
01:35:25,224 --> 01:35:25,684
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1172
01:35:26,706 --> 01:35:30,871
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm actually going to start I just want to lead with a technical question to make sure the board.

1173
01:35:31,680 --> 01:35:35,441
[SPEAKER_09]: is understanding and considering the right criteria here.

1174
01:35:35,481 --> 01:35:44,164
[SPEAKER_09]: So the application is to amend that was from back in 2015.

1175
01:35:45,504 --> 01:35:54,307
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I just want to make sure what the specific portion of the variance is that needs amending.

1176
01:35:54,667 --> 01:35:55,947
[SPEAKER_09]: Was it a use variance?

1177
01:35:56,167 --> 01:35:59,088
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, does it need to amend the use portion?

1178
01:36:02,122 --> 01:36:11,789
[SPEAKER_09]: I know it references that the petition already had the mail space, but I'm not seeing any specific language in the variance pertaining to that.

1179
01:36:11,909 --> 01:36:13,950
[SPEAKER_09]: So could you just clarify where the...

1180
01:36:16,980 --> 01:36:23,582
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe it was for the condition that the ground level would be retail, or I'm sorry, commercial space.

1181
01:36:23,622 --> 01:36:24,782
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry about that, the retail.

1182
01:36:24,802 --> 01:36:38,485
[SPEAKER_12]: But so it's because I believe when it is worded correctly in the advertisement that's in the meeting agenda, it's an amendment to the condition of the variant.

1183
01:36:38,525 --> 01:36:43,566
[SPEAKER_12]: So one of the conditions was that there would be a commercial space on the ground level.

1184
01:36:43,586 --> 01:36:45,387
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1185
01:36:46,039 --> 01:36:49,260
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so there's language in the variance itself.

1186
01:36:50,620 --> 01:37:06,004
[SPEAKER_09]: It says, as required by the site plan review process, a number of City of Medford department heads have submitted letters to the Zoning Board of Appeals recommending and in some instances requiring compliance with certain conditions to be incorporated as part of any approvals that may be granted by the ZBA.

1187
01:37:06,024 --> 01:37:12,026
[SPEAKER_09]: Then it says rather than repeating here each and every recommendation requirement,

1188
01:37:12,945 --> 01:37:17,009
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to require all of them, with one exception.

1189
01:37:17,029 --> 01:37:24,095
[SPEAKER_09]: There were some recommendations from the Historical Commission that the board diverged from.

1190
01:37:24,195 --> 01:37:30,921
[SPEAKER_09]: So was that required by the CD board in their recommendation or some other?

1191
01:37:31,462 --> 01:37:36,266
[SPEAKER_12]: No, it was required by the Zoning Board of Appeals in their decision.

1192
01:37:36,908 --> 01:37:50,480
[SPEAKER_09]: My point is the decision, and sorry, I don't want to drag it out, but the decision basically says we impose the conditions as the zoning board that the various departments and boards recommended.

1193
01:37:51,141 --> 01:37:56,286
[SPEAKER_09]: But it doesn't say which recommendation that came from.

1194
01:37:56,386 --> 01:38:00,670
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm just trying to make sure we understand where it's required.

1195
01:38:01,254 --> 01:38:01,474
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

1196
01:38:01,694 --> 01:38:10,057
[SPEAKER_12]: I, you know, I have the original decision and, you know, rebuilding 42 residential units.

1197
01:38:17,519 --> 01:38:21,960
[SPEAKER_12]: There was a slew of yes, requirements, but.

1198
01:38:22,879 --> 01:38:26,062
[SPEAKER_12]: Unfortunately, I was not the attorney at all.

1199
01:38:27,083 --> 01:38:31,007
[SPEAKER_12]: And when you are the original attorney, it's amazing the things that you'll remember.

1200
01:38:31,427 --> 01:38:43,518
[SPEAKER_12]: But I believe because it was to be a mixed-use building, the logical is you put commercial on the ground level, not on the second or third floor.

1201
01:38:43,538 --> 01:38:45,540
[SPEAKER_12]: And I read through it.

1202
01:38:50,903 --> 01:38:51,725
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to belabor it.

1203
01:38:51,765 --> 01:38:53,467
[SPEAKER_09]: So here's what I'll recommend.

1204
01:38:53,587 --> 01:38:54,288
[SPEAKER_09]: So clearly the.

1205
01:38:54,368 --> 01:39:05,202
[SPEAKER_09]: The variance was granted references the plans, which did have the retail and it references conditions recommended by various boards.

1206
01:39:06,148 --> 01:39:21,911
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not anyway as a board voting on the amendment today, so we'll just kind of take as a fact for consideration that this indirect reference impose some condition that required the retail space and the board will be voting on whether to

1207
01:39:22,591 --> 01:39:30,975
[SPEAKER_09]: amend the decision to remove that condition, and we can figure out later exactly how that needs to be worded.

1208
01:39:32,116 --> 01:39:38,779
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'll just, it sounds like you're agreeable to that, so I'll open the floor to other members of the board.

1209
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:41,640
[SPEAKER_09]: Questions from the board?

1210
01:39:48,863 --> 01:39:49,764
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead, Jim.

1211
01:39:51,193 --> 01:39:57,519
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you have any pictures of what the apartment will look like from the outside?

1212
01:39:57,539 --> 01:40:09,630
[SPEAKER_08]: But it will look exactly like the ground floor, let me share my screen again, looks today.

1213
01:40:09,650 --> 01:40:12,012
[SPEAKER_08]: We are not proposing any changes to the

1214
01:40:15,282 --> 01:40:37,945
[SPEAKER_08]: the architecture per se you know we will likely have some type of window treatment on the inside that would allow the resident to you know similar to the upper levels roll the view in and out but this will largely look as it does today it's really just an interior modification and change

1215
01:40:40,494 --> 01:40:42,196
[SPEAKER_14]: Are those the doors that would be?

1216
01:40:42,216 --> 01:40:48,321
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, these would just stay as is, but we would allow them to be used only for the building.

1217
01:40:48,381 --> 01:40:51,464
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't anticipate this being a new front door.

1218
01:40:51,904 --> 01:40:59,190
[SPEAKER_08]: We are not proposing to put on hardware that would allow somebody to come in and walk in this way.

1219
01:40:59,491 --> 01:41:07,518
[SPEAKER_08]: We prefer actually that these doors stay secure and closed and only in the event of an emergency could be used out of the building.

1220
01:41:09,961 --> 01:41:24,954
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we really want to direct people in through the existing lobby front door, which is down the page on the left here of this image, grab their mail, packages, and then make their way into the unit through the corridor on the backside.

1221
01:41:24,974 --> 01:41:28,377
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1222
01:41:29,809 --> 01:41:35,391
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, and then I saw hands from both Chris and Andre, and I wasn't paying attention to who raised first.

1223
01:41:35,431 --> 01:41:37,492
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll go to Chris next.

1224
01:41:37,592 --> 01:41:38,673
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. Chair.

1225
01:41:39,213 --> 01:41:52,738
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a similar question to yours, which is, I assume this must have been permitted under some sort of special permit with site plan review or something similar.

1226
01:41:52,798 --> 01:41:59,461
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would think the condition for the ground floor retail would have been in that permit.

1227
01:42:01,258 --> 01:42:03,159
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's my best guess, Chris.

1228
01:42:03,680 --> 01:42:10,284
[SPEAKER_09]: But unfortunately, I didn't see in the folder the site plan review, so I wasn't able to independently verify it.

1229
01:42:10,365 --> 01:42:16,509
[SPEAKER_09]: It sounds like a condition that would be coming recommended by the CD board during that process.

1230
01:42:16,769 --> 01:42:21,112
[SPEAKER_09]: And a lot of the other letters that were there didn't specifically reference it.

1231
01:42:21,192 --> 01:42:23,094
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's my operating assumption.

1232
01:42:23,134 --> 01:42:25,155
[SPEAKER_09]: But like I said, I don't think we have to

1233
01:42:27,327 --> 01:42:29,308
[SPEAKER_09]: Did not conclusively today.

1234
01:42:30,128 --> 01:42:38,432
[SPEAKER_09]: We can vote on whether to amend and then figure out the specific language to amend later if the board chooses to approve the amendment.

1235
01:42:39,352 --> 01:42:40,173
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, thank you.

1236
01:42:40,213 --> 01:42:42,754
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, Andre.

1237
01:42:45,735 --> 01:42:49,157
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I was going to ask what Jim was asking.

1238
01:42:49,177 --> 01:42:53,498
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it seems like there should be some modification to the exterior

1239
01:42:57,769 --> 01:42:57,974
[SPEAKER_11]: Bye.

1240
01:43:00,916 --> 01:43:11,298
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, just as a perhaps counterpoint, I think a lot of people look for and like a loft feel apartment.

1241
01:43:11,338 --> 01:43:15,219
[SPEAKER_08]: This has a ground floor with a tall ceiling and big windows.

1242
01:43:15,279 --> 01:43:29,083
[SPEAKER_08]: I know it may not look conventional in its residential appearance, but I think would be very appealing and interesting to a number of folks that would consider making this their home and renting it.

1243
01:43:31,443 --> 01:43:32,764
[SPEAKER_08]: understand your feedback.

1244
01:43:32,784 --> 01:43:38,706
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1245
01:43:39,046 --> 01:43:39,446
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1246
01:43:39,826 --> 01:43:40,687
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll go next.

1247
01:43:41,467 --> 01:43:54,012
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you talked with anyone in the city departments about the proposal to convert this from retail to residential?

1248
01:43:54,032 --> 01:43:56,653
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have any feedback from them on the proposal?

1249
01:43:59,211 --> 01:44:00,752
[SPEAKER_12]: This is Anne Figueredo once again.

1250
01:44:00,952 --> 01:44:11,955
[SPEAKER_12]: I spoke to the director, the commissioner in ISD for some direction and just to build upon that with the doors.

1251
01:44:11,975 --> 01:44:14,396
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I'm sure everything will have to be code compliant.

1252
01:44:14,456 --> 01:44:19,617
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm sure the building will have things that would want to see that.

1253
01:44:19,977 --> 01:44:23,698
[SPEAKER_12]: But in the infancy stages, I did talk to

1254
01:44:25,599 --> 01:44:29,161
[SPEAKER_12]: some of the planning people and I did receive positive feedback.

1255
01:44:30,021 --> 01:44:34,923
[SPEAKER_12]: I also talked to one of the city counselors last year.

1256
01:44:34,943 --> 01:44:42,787
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd say last spring, I spoke to Kit Collins and she had some positive feedback.

1257
01:44:44,728 --> 01:44:49,350
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, at the time, the sphere was debating, you know, should we

1258
01:44:49,930 --> 01:44:54,154
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, do this or, you know, keep an empty space.

1259
01:44:54,174 --> 01:45:03,782
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think, you know, it just made so much more sense that, you know, the residential would be much more worthwhile.

1260
01:45:03,963 --> 01:45:06,565
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, as I said, I think

1261
01:45:09,492 --> 01:45:19,039
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, non-vacant residential unit versus, you know, this blank retail space, you know, is much more attractive.

1262
01:45:19,579 --> 01:45:30,747
[SPEAKER_12]: I've always felt that, you know, this is almost an attractive nuisance, you know, and they see an empty space and, you know, you don't know, it's almost like a,

1263
01:45:32,957 --> 01:45:41,900
[SPEAKER_12]: an invitation to, you know, they haven't had any issues, but my fear was the, you know, something could happen if someone notices that it's vacant long enough.

1264
01:45:43,381 --> 01:45:52,904
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know they get the owners as, you know, they, as Paul did, many of the other tenants in the building have asked, gee, you know, do you think you could make it into an

1265
01:45:53,884 --> 01:45:57,365
[SPEAKER_12]: a residential unit, I have a friend that would really like to be on a first level.

1266
01:45:57,485 --> 01:46:07,567
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, like I said, I did speak to some of the planning people, you know, Dennis McDougall always gives great direction.

1267
01:46:07,667 --> 01:46:10,568
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, I had conversations with him about it.

1268
01:46:10,628 --> 01:46:21,650
[SPEAKER_12]: And I did speak to, you know, building department officials, and the most recently the commissioner, but some of the other building inspectors, and they seemed very positive about it.

1269
01:46:23,367 --> 01:46:27,151
[SPEAKER_12]: And like I said, I did email Kit Collins that we were going forward.

1270
01:46:27,171 --> 01:46:33,879
[SPEAKER_12]: I haven't heard back from her, but when I initially spoke to her, she seemed positive about it.

1271
01:46:34,099 --> 01:46:36,001
[SPEAKER_12]: She thought it was a good thought.

1272
01:46:37,823 --> 01:46:38,504
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, thank you.

1273
01:46:38,524 --> 01:46:41,007
[SPEAKER_09]: Other questions from the board?

1274
01:46:44,967 --> 01:46:48,794
[SPEAKER_04]: This is just purely for aesthetic purposes.

1275
01:46:50,217 --> 01:46:54,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there any alternatives for this store?

1276
01:46:57,014 --> 01:47:01,256
[SPEAKER_04]: For the exterior of the door, it's basically for aesthetic purposes.

1277
01:47:01,296 --> 01:47:04,237
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just wondering if there's a possibility for modification.

1278
01:47:04,737 --> 01:47:04,997
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

1279
01:47:05,257 --> 01:47:20,622
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I know, you know, I brought this up because they'll have the sphere, you know, with their contractor will have to work with the building department and, you know,

1280
01:47:21,362 --> 01:47:31,810
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sure they're going to have to follow building code, but Eric might be able to make some suggestions of alternatives, but I'm sure everything will be code compliant.

1281
01:47:33,331 --> 01:47:41,137
[SPEAKER_08]: I think from a design perspective and cost perspective, to be honest, it's unlikely that there would be

1282
01:47:43,871 --> 01:47:48,433
[SPEAKER_08]: design modifications that are kind of structural in nature, changing the windows, et cetera.

1283
01:47:48,453 --> 01:48:10,484
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, there could be an opportunity to provide some type of translucent film or something like that to maybe change the character of the glass, but unlikely to pull out the doors and replace it with something else, given the cost of construction.

1284
01:48:12,405 --> 01:48:16,629
[SPEAKER_08]: the pressure on that for the success of this project.

1285
01:48:16,710 --> 01:48:33,707
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know early on when we first started looking at it, we thought, oh, it'd be really interesting to put like an infill, that whole little recessed area with a planter and, you know, have some plants or whatever growing, you know, in the container in that space.

1286
01:48:33,807 --> 01:48:33,967
[SPEAKER_08]: But

1287
01:48:34,728 --> 01:48:38,451
[SPEAKER_08]: from a building code perspective we needed the second means of egress.

1288
01:48:38,991 --> 01:48:52,902
[SPEAKER_08]: The first will be going out through the front door of the apartment which goes out into that hallway to an egress door and then the second means of egress again emergency would be out one of these double doors.

1289
01:48:54,203 --> 01:49:03,590
[SPEAKER_08]: So the idea of kind of putting a planter there seemed like a you know non-starter to comply with building code but yeah so

1290
01:49:05,363 --> 01:49:17,087
[SPEAKER_08]: Long answer is probably not going to be any major design opportunities to transform the storefront, but there could be some minor applications that could be considered, I suppose.

1291
01:49:20,908 --> 01:49:23,189
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1292
01:49:24,389 --> 01:49:30,511
[SPEAKER_09]: Along the lines of where Mary was going with this, I understand

1293
01:49:31,725 --> 01:49:36,227
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not technically required to revisit the Community Development Board.

1294
01:49:37,822 --> 01:49:40,323
[SPEAKER_09]: before asking for an amendment to the variance.

1295
01:49:40,343 --> 01:49:46,026
[SPEAKER_09]: We certainly have some first-hand knowledge of the challenges filling the space.

1296
01:49:47,106 --> 01:49:59,211
[SPEAKER_09]: If we were going back to 2015, the zoning board at that time felt it was necessary to impose a condition that we think came from the CD board at the time during the required site plan review.

1297
01:49:59,231 --> 01:50:04,953
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you considered going back before the CD board and just getting their take on the proposal?

1298
01:50:11,962 --> 01:50:33,803
[SPEAKER_09]: Because otherwise the zoning board is going to be trying to decide between, well, does the experience you've had filling this retail space and the hardship it's created, is that enough to revisit and compensate for the prior

1299
01:50:35,102 --> 01:50:40,386
[SPEAKER_09]: recommendation from the CD board that the zoning board felt was necessary to impose.

1300
01:50:40,886 --> 01:50:46,911
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, if you could, if you just went before the CD board, it would perhaps put that issue to rest.

1301
01:50:51,174 --> 01:50:56,017
[SPEAKER_12]: So are you asking us to go to the CD board and come back or?

1302
01:50:56,038 --> 01:50:57,879
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't.

1303
01:50:58,652 --> 01:51:04,774
[SPEAKER_09]: take it to the extreme of me specifically asking you to do that, but I'm just presenting some possible options.

1304
01:51:04,834 --> 01:51:12,417
[SPEAKER_09]: It sounds like you haven't considered that, or at least haven't chosen to do that yet.

1305
01:51:13,438 --> 01:51:24,342
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think it would be required for the board to render a decision for you to make that visit, and I understand it adds time and potential costs, but just in terms of what you're asking the board to do,

1306
01:51:25,389 --> 01:51:27,431
[SPEAKER_09]: You're sharing your experience renting the space.

1307
01:51:27,511 --> 01:51:29,112
[SPEAKER_09]: The board can certainly weigh in on that.

1308
01:51:29,793 --> 01:51:31,514
[SPEAKER_09]: We can share historical information.

1309
01:51:31,534 --> 01:51:38,740
[SPEAKER_09]: The CDE board made the recommendation that required this retail space in the past.

1310
01:51:38,840 --> 01:51:45,946
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you were to go before them, they could clarify now, with the benefit of this information, whether their view has also changed.

1311
01:51:55,295 --> 01:51:56,536
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, just just throwing that out there.

1312
01:51:56,556 --> 01:51:58,718
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not trying to like, there's no hidden message.

1313
01:51:58,758 --> 01:52:02,040
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not trying to process.

1314
01:52:02,141 --> 01:52:10,968
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I think if the board board, I mean, perhaps we could have the architect meet with someone from the CD board for, you know.

1315
01:52:11,788 --> 01:52:15,671
[SPEAKER_12]: direction on some design so that, you know, we're not coming back.

1316
01:52:15,751 --> 01:52:34,103
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's like you said, it ended up being, you know, it could be a six month ordeal, or it just might be faster to say, well, if the board is comfortable with voting to approve, perhaps a condition of that is the architects tech work CD board on, you know, some design matters.

1317
01:52:35,376 --> 01:52:40,861
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, we have to be careful in how we worded it, so it couldn't be conditional on a CD board approval.

1318
01:52:40,921 --> 01:52:52,690
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, we could have some language saying, you know, conditional on the architect talking with the CD board to review some design considerations.

1319
01:52:53,251 --> 01:52:53,991
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a good point.

1320
01:52:55,793 --> 01:52:57,534
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I try to keep it simplified.

1321
01:52:57,574 --> 01:53:01,998
[SPEAKER_12]: I figured that to less confusion, more simplified.

1322
01:53:04,853 --> 01:53:08,194
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, other questions from the board?

1323
01:53:08,214 --> 01:53:14,476
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, we will open it up to public comment.

1324
01:53:14,596 --> 01:53:19,878
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're a member of the public and you'd like to speak on this matter, you may do so now.

1325
01:53:19,978 --> 01:53:26,300
[SPEAKER_09]: You can raise your hand on Zoom, type in the chat, turn on your camera and raise your hand.

1326
01:53:27,020 --> 01:53:29,881
[SPEAKER_09]: You can email Dennis dmcdougall at medford-ma.gov.

1327
01:53:32,049 --> 01:53:38,817
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe Attorney Vigarito already mentioned that there are a bunch of letters of support from residents and one of the neighboring businesses.

1328
01:53:38,837 --> 01:53:47,907
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, Shereen Cousins, please state your name and address for the record.

1329
01:53:49,175 --> 01:53:52,077
[SPEAKER_15]: My name is Shireen Cousins, 71 Riverside Avenue.

1330
01:53:52,097 --> 01:54:09,768
[SPEAKER_15]: I came in a little bit late to the meeting and I just was trying to understand, is it finalized that it's not going to be a retail property anymore and you're definitely changing it to an apartment location?

1331
01:54:10,348 --> 01:54:12,650
[SPEAKER_15]: Are we trying to decide that right now in this meeting?

1332
01:54:13,613 --> 01:54:14,073
[SPEAKER_09]: Great question.

1333
01:54:14,093 --> 01:54:23,720
[SPEAKER_09]: So the request is back in 2015, the zoning board approved some variances, which included a condition that that ground floor be retail.

1334
01:54:24,580 --> 01:54:32,966
[SPEAKER_09]: And the request is that the board amend that decision to remove the condition that the ground floor be retail.

1335
01:54:33,146 --> 01:54:36,989
[SPEAKER_09]: So it seems the intention is to convert it into residential.

1336
01:54:37,629 --> 01:54:40,491
[SPEAKER_09]: And so the board's deciding whether to remove that condition.

1337
01:54:41,398 --> 01:54:42,899
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, definitely understand.

1338
01:54:43,319 --> 01:55:04,051
[SPEAKER_15]: My only concern with it being now apartments, I think it may be other people's concern as well, is the visual aspect and the safety of it living on the ground floor and people having that much access, whether the glasses are not, if somebody can just peer through, that's a little invasive.

1339
01:55:04,131 --> 01:55:05,472
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's just my thoughts.

1340
01:55:05,492 --> 01:55:06,613
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1341
01:55:06,893 --> 01:55:07,173
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1342
01:55:10,095 --> 01:55:13,338
[SPEAKER_09]: Other comments from members of the public?

1343
01:55:21,524 --> 01:55:23,926
[SPEAKER_09]: I do not see any.

1344
01:55:24,286 --> 01:55:30,070
[SPEAKER_09]: So the chair awaits a motion to close the public portion of the hearing and enter deliberation.

1345
01:55:30,090 --> 01:55:33,133
[SPEAKER_09]: So moved.

1346
01:55:34,154 --> 01:55:34,554
[SPEAKER_09]: Second.

1347
01:55:34,934 --> 01:55:35,194
[SPEAKER_09]: Second.

1348
01:55:35,374 --> 01:55:36,776
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, we'll take a roll call.

1349
01:55:37,736 --> 01:55:38,057
[SPEAKER_09]: Chris?

1350
01:55:39,262 --> 01:55:39,402
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

1351
01:55:39,842 --> 01:55:40,122
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

1352
01:55:40,662 --> 01:55:41,102
[SPEAKER_09]: Mary.

1353
01:55:41,122 --> 01:55:41,923
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

1354
01:55:42,483 --> 01:55:42,883
[SPEAKER_09]: Jim.

1355
01:55:43,463 --> 01:55:43,603
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

1356
01:55:44,723 --> 01:55:45,023
[SPEAKER_09]: Mike.

1357
01:55:45,444 --> 01:55:45,584
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

1358
01:55:45,904 --> 01:55:47,144
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, we are now deliberating.

1359
01:55:47,184 --> 01:55:48,004
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you think, folks?

1360
01:55:53,345 --> 01:56:03,288
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess one thing I'll clarify as we deliberate my read on the original variance is that changing from

1361
01:56:05,487 --> 01:56:15,551
[SPEAKER_09]: Retail to residential doesn't fundamentally change the hardship that they needed to demonstrate at the time for the variance.

1362
01:56:15,591 --> 01:56:30,917
[SPEAKER_09]: So I do think the board can basically consider, in light of this additional hardship, whether to amend the variance in some manner, which could include changing a condition or removing a condition.

1363
01:56:37,773 --> 01:56:38,074
[SPEAKER_11]: Andre.

1364
01:56:39,382 --> 01:56:39,804
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks, Mike.

1365
01:56:41,285 --> 01:56:49,569
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been 10 years since the project has been permitted and they've only had for eight months of that whole time.

1366
01:56:49,889 --> 01:56:53,951
[SPEAKER_11]: I do understand the issue here.

1367
01:56:53,971 --> 01:57:09,858
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a little unfortunate, I think, but probably the best outcome that we can hope for is to put a residential unit in there if they're not going to expand the amenity space down below.

1368
01:57:12,367 --> 01:57:13,628
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, thanks, Andre.

1369
01:57:13,828 --> 01:57:15,008
[SPEAKER_11]: Other thoughts from the board?

1370
01:57:21,131 --> 01:57:21,511
[SPEAKER_05]: Chris.

1371
01:57:22,812 --> 01:57:40,860
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, not to belabor the point either, but back to the original point, do they really just need to amend the special permit and the zoning board even

1372
01:57:42,807 --> 01:57:45,228
[SPEAKER_05]: had jurisdiction over.

1373
01:57:45,248 --> 01:57:58,695
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so Chris, what I know with certainty with the info we have is that the zoning board imposed as a condition any recommendation that was in the CD board letter.

1374
01:57:59,796 --> 01:58:00,476
[SPEAKER_09]: That part I know.

1375
01:58:00,496 --> 01:58:08,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Just transferred everything from the special permit from the CD board over to what became a variance.

1376
01:58:09,528 --> 01:58:11,770
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I mean, at the time, the zoning was different.

1377
01:58:12,031 --> 01:58:16,775
[SPEAKER_09]: I think special permits were somewhat more narrow, at least.

1378
01:58:16,875 --> 01:58:21,340
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't, I haven't done like the full legal diff then and now.

1379
01:58:21,460 --> 01:58:30,730
[SPEAKER_09]: But, but yeah, it's, if indeed it is the case, which that is my understanding that the zoning board

1380
01:58:32,120 --> 01:58:43,072
[SPEAKER_09]: imposed as a condition of the variance this requirement, then it would be inadequate to merely modify a special permit.

1381
01:58:43,172 --> 01:58:45,114
[SPEAKER_09]: It does require an amendment.

1382
01:58:46,052 --> 01:58:47,713
[SPEAKER_09]: was referenced in the original.

1383
01:58:48,333 --> 01:58:50,774
[SPEAKER_09]: It was like a non-conforming structure.

1384
01:58:50,794 --> 01:59:04,738
[SPEAKER_09]: They can change the use by special permit subject to some, we'd have to make a determination, but since it's in the variance, it was only allowed by variance, that's the variance itself needs to be amended.

1385
01:59:04,758 --> 01:59:08,020
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1386
01:59:08,780 --> 01:59:11,481
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it seems odd, but I'll go with that.

1387
01:59:14,376 --> 01:59:21,244
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my only, I don't have, you know, honestly, to the point of the project, um, I know this is happening.

1388
01:59:22,998 --> 01:59:46,394
[SPEAKER_05]: uh you know across a lot of valuable real estate so it's not surprising to me that these folks are here for us to request this um i do you know it would be nice to know that at some point perhaps when things get busier once again at these once current being

1389
01:59:47,403 --> 01:59:55,487
[SPEAKER_05]: commercial in some way, you know, but it will be of course up to the owner, whatever is more profitable, seek that.

1390
01:59:56,788 --> 01:59:57,028
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1391
01:59:57,068 --> 02:00:05,052
[SPEAKER_09]: So Chris, if we were to remove the condition that it be a retail space,

1392
02:00:06,330 --> 02:00:22,261
[SPEAKER_09]: and so the applicant intends to convert it to retail, if they then in the future wanted to convert it to residential, they then in the future wanted to convert it back to retail, it would just require a special permit.

1393
02:00:22,281 --> 02:00:31,588
[SPEAKER_09]: It's only modify the variance if there was a condition that needs to go away, changing the use of

1394
02:00:32,587 --> 02:00:36,972
[SPEAKER_09]: non-conforming structure, which would still be non-conforming, that's just a special permit.

1395
02:00:37,772 --> 02:00:40,915
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's what I would hope that would be the case, right?

1396
02:00:43,578 --> 02:00:45,120
[SPEAKER_07]: Other thoughts from the board?

1397
02:00:47,958 --> 02:00:59,349
[SPEAKER_04]: So Mike will be voting what the condition of the architect, the CD for, or are we just voting for the amendment?

1398
02:00:59,729 --> 02:01:03,253
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's for the board to determine.

1399
02:01:03,413 --> 02:01:10,840
[SPEAKER_09]: The relief required is the outright removal or modification of the condition requiring the retail space.

1400
02:01:11,840 --> 02:01:19,943
[SPEAKER_09]: But in modifying the variance, the board could impose other conditions within its purview.

1401
02:01:19,983 --> 02:01:33,987
[SPEAKER_09]: So we could, for example, remove the requirement that it be a retail space and add the condition that the architect discuss with members of the board.

1402
02:01:36,575 --> 02:01:44,222
[SPEAKER_09]: City Planning Department and the Community Development Board possible design choices for the ground floor unit or something like that.

1403
02:01:50,488 --> 02:01:51,209
[SPEAKER_11]: Andre?

1404
02:01:52,710 --> 02:01:54,072
[SPEAKER_11]: Just on that issue, you know,

1405
02:01:57,628 --> 02:02:00,490
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel that that has very little benefit.

1406
02:02:01,051 --> 02:02:11,579
[SPEAKER_11]: The CD board members are not the same as the ones that this project and I don't really see what they're going to be able to do at this point.

1407
02:02:11,599 --> 02:02:20,486
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I'm not necessarily in favor of adding another condition.

1408
02:02:22,086 --> 02:02:24,408
[SPEAKER_09]: A condition like that has limited legal teeth.

1409
02:02:25,068 --> 02:02:36,098
[SPEAKER_09]: It signals the zoning board's desire and requires a conversation, but it can't require an approval.

1410
02:02:36,158 --> 02:02:38,119
[SPEAKER_09]: Legally, those don't hold up anyway.

1411
02:02:40,061 --> 02:02:47,668
[SPEAKER_09]: In that sense, the condition for signaling, I think, then legal teeth.

1412
02:02:54,050 --> 02:02:57,154
[SPEAKER_09]: Other thoughts from the board?

1413
02:02:57,174 --> 02:03:10,751
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I mean, my take, I think 10 years is a long time.

1414
02:03:12,851 --> 02:03:21,613
[SPEAKER_09]: I do think there was ample incentive for the owner to try to find a tenant, and clearly they struggled mightily.

1415
02:03:22,193 --> 02:03:33,896
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, the location, while somewhat nearby other retail businesses, it is a bit of an odd walk.

1416
02:03:33,956 --> 02:03:35,276
[SPEAKER_09]: It's on an island of sorts.

1417
02:03:35,496 --> 02:03:39,317
[SPEAKER_09]: So I do see the hardship in this case.

1418
02:03:41,073 --> 02:03:44,214
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm comfortable proceeding.

1419
02:03:44,274 --> 02:03:47,694
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think we need to have an additional checkpoint.

1420
02:03:47,934 --> 02:03:50,575
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to unnecessarily delay things further.

1421
02:03:50,715 --> 02:03:52,835
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's all.

1422
02:03:52,915 --> 02:04:01,637
[SPEAKER_09]: I think from a legal perspective, modification is the same criteria used to justify the variance before would apply to this new proposal.

1423
02:04:01,797 --> 02:04:09,678
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's just more of a board determination whether we're comfortable removing that condition or modifying it.

1424
02:04:14,685 --> 02:04:27,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Chair, I move to approve to remove the condition on the variance requiring commercial space on the first floor.

1425
02:04:27,152 --> 02:04:28,533
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1426
02:04:28,593 --> 02:04:29,213
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have a second?

1427
02:04:29,493 --> 02:04:30,074
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll second.

1428
02:04:31,314 --> 02:04:31,694
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

1429
02:04:32,155 --> 02:04:34,256
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to take a vote.

1430
02:04:34,736 --> 02:04:35,216
[SPEAKER_09]: Andre?

1431
02:04:35,236 --> 02:04:35,977
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

1432
02:04:36,737 --> 02:04:37,198
[SPEAKER_09]: Chris?

1433
02:04:37,718 --> 02:04:37,838
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

1434
02:04:38,378 --> 02:04:38,818
[SPEAKER_09]: Mary?

1435
02:04:39,459 --> 02:04:39,579
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

1436
02:04:40,419 --> 02:04:40,759
[SPEAKER_09]: Jim?

1437
02:04:41,480 --> 02:04:41,620
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

1438
02:04:42,466 --> 02:04:43,366
[SPEAKER_09]: Mike, aye.

1439
02:04:43,386 --> 02:04:46,887
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, the variance is hereby amended.

1440
02:04:47,547 --> 02:04:49,887
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll work on putting that into writing.

1441
02:04:49,947 --> 02:04:58,689
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll figure out the precise way to word it so it has legal bite or clout so you can do the modification.

1442
02:04:59,129 --> 02:05:01,849
[SPEAKER_09]: Dennis, any other logistical items on this one?

1443
02:05:02,789 --> 02:05:03,490
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I don't think so.

1444
02:05:03,510 --> 02:05:08,990
[SPEAKER_18]: But actually, do a first pass at it and send it over to me just to my expedite matters.

1445
02:05:09,051 --> 02:05:11,631
[SPEAKER_18]: If you can do that, that would probably help matters quite a bit.

1446
02:05:12,379 --> 02:05:12,619
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

1447
02:05:12,740 --> 02:05:16,284
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, my office will run that and you know, we'll converse with you.

1448
02:05:16,665 --> 02:05:17,045
[SPEAKER_18]: Exactly.

1449
02:05:17,105 --> 02:05:19,268
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll be here to be a sounding board as well.

1450
02:05:20,330 --> 02:05:21,031
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you so much.

1451
02:05:21,852 --> 02:05:22,232
[SPEAKER_07]: That's great.

1452
02:05:22,252 --> 02:05:22,713
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks, folks.

1453
02:05:22,773 --> 02:05:23,254
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a good night.

1454
02:05:24,455 --> 02:05:24,996
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1455
02:05:25,076 --> 02:05:25,457
[SPEAKER_12]: Good night.

1456
02:05:25,497 --> 02:05:26,258
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much.

1457
02:05:26,278 --> 02:05:26,919
[SPEAKER_12]: Have a great evening.

1458
02:05:26,939 --> 02:05:27,520
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

1459
02:05:29,348 --> 02:05:32,669
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so what's next, Dennis?

1460
02:05:32,689 --> 02:05:34,369
[SPEAKER_18]: 289 Fellsway West, case number A-2025-07.

1461
02:05:34,469 --> 02:05:48,973
[SPEAKER_18]: Applicant and owner, Edmond DeMori, to change a single-family home at 289 Fellsway West to a two-family home in a general residence zoning district allowed use within a sufficient lot area lot width per the City Method Zoning Ordinance, Chapter 94, Table B, Table of Dimensional Requirements.

1462
02:05:51,333 --> 02:05:56,135
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, I see we have someone named Edmond here, so is that you?

1463
02:05:56,935 --> 02:05:57,455
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, welcome.

1464
02:06:03,145 --> 02:06:04,386
[SPEAKER_09]: You're currently on mute.

1465
02:06:05,147 --> 02:06:06,148
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

1466
02:06:07,929 --> 02:06:08,129
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi.

1467
02:06:09,430 --> 02:06:09,751
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome.

1468
02:06:09,791 --> 02:06:12,353
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so we are hearing your case.

1469
02:06:12,413 --> 02:06:15,976
[SPEAKER_09]: I know you made a submit, provided a bunch of details.

1470
02:06:16,316 --> 02:06:18,758
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there anything you'd like to present to the board?

1471
02:06:19,659 --> 02:06:21,480
[SPEAKER_16]: I just want to say thank you for the opportunity.

1472
02:06:21,500 --> 02:06:24,543
[SPEAKER_16]: I did plans that I have submitted.

1473
02:06:25,543 --> 02:06:29,527
[SPEAKER_16]: The house was a single family, got approved for two floors.

1474
02:06:31,068 --> 02:06:34,791
[SPEAKER_16]: single family, and I'm just trying to make it a two-family.

1475
02:06:36,252 --> 02:06:44,018
[SPEAKER_16]: And I did provide parking and basically the only thing I need is the lot size that I don't have.

1476
02:06:44,839 --> 02:06:49,283
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm just trying to see if I can get the approval.

1477
02:06:49,303 --> 02:06:54,647
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, Dennis, could you maybe help so we can... Yeah, I'm jumping on that now.

1478
02:07:06,460 --> 02:07:07,181
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it showing up?

1479
02:07:07,861 --> 02:07:08,121
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1480
02:07:08,482 --> 02:07:08,802
[SPEAKER_14]: OK, great.

1481
02:07:12,045 --> 02:07:13,566
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, so we're looking at the plan.

1482
02:07:13,586 --> 02:07:19,210
[SPEAKER_09]: So can you maybe walk us through the petition?

1483
02:07:19,291 --> 02:07:32,922
[SPEAKER_09]: So we need, you do need a, actually, is it, Dennis, is this a variance or a special permit to change the use?

1484
02:07:36,021 --> 02:07:41,524
[SPEAKER_09]: I know a lot of the dimensional violations are staying the same.

1485
02:07:42,105 --> 02:07:51,490
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a variance because it's going from a single to a two, the lot width and the lot area are increasing, which would then- Right, got it.

1486
02:07:51,510 --> 02:07:55,052
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's my reading on the ordinance as well.

1487
02:07:55,092 --> 02:07:55,412
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1488
02:07:55,952 --> 02:08:03,837
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, so Edmund, as part of the petition for the variance, you need to

1489
02:08:05,521 --> 02:08:24,959
[SPEAKER_09]: The board is going to need to associate something unusual with the shape, topography, or soil conditions of the lot and or structures with the hardship

1490
02:08:26,317 --> 02:08:29,938
[SPEAKER_09]: in literally enforcing the zoning ordinance.

1491
02:08:29,998 --> 02:08:31,878
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is a GR district.

1492
02:08:31,958 --> 02:08:33,739
[SPEAKER_09]: The use is allowed by right.

1493
02:08:33,919 --> 02:08:37,879
[SPEAKER_09]: If the dimensional requirements are satisfied, they are not.

1494
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:48,102
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you could walk us through the unusual aspects of the lot and or structures, as well as the hardship.

1495
02:08:51,782 --> 02:08:54,943
[SPEAKER_16]: So currently, it used to be a single family with one floor.

1496
02:08:57,254 --> 02:09:01,599
[SPEAKER_16]: I got the approval for permit number BRP24-00416.

1497
02:09:12,070 --> 02:09:21,875
[SPEAKER_16]: And based on that permit, the house got demolished, a whole new foundation, and we got a new basement and first floor and second floor.

1498
02:09:22,255 --> 02:09:29,218
[SPEAKER_16]: Got approved for five bedrooms, a living room, and three-fold bath, one in the basement, and one on the first floor, and one on the second floor.

1499
02:09:29,258 --> 02:09:31,339
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's what currently we have right now.

1500
02:09:32,960 --> 02:09:37,562
[SPEAKER_16]: But I was just wondering if I, since I already, I'm not changing,

1501
02:09:38,500 --> 02:09:42,842
[SPEAKER_16]: The height or anything has been the way it is right now from the outside.

1502
02:09:42,862 --> 02:09:46,384
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm only converting it to two families that are single family.

1503
02:09:48,925 --> 02:09:53,987
[SPEAKER_16]: So everything will stay the same the way it is right now, per the permit that I was just gave you earlier.

1504
02:09:54,467 --> 02:10:05,332
[SPEAKER_16]: Just the adjustment will be for like the second floor will have two easements where like the main one and the backup one for emergency and the same thing for the first floor.

1505
02:10:06,402 --> 02:10:11,446
[SPEAKER_16]: and three parking lot being provided and nothing's outside of the house.

1506
02:10:11,486 --> 02:10:13,388
[SPEAKER_16]: It still has the same exact dimensions.

1507
02:10:17,531 --> 02:10:20,133
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, questions from the board so far?

1508
02:10:28,240 --> 02:10:33,604
[SPEAKER_09]: Dennis, we also have the architectural plans, is that right?

1509
02:10:33,644 --> 02:10:34,425
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that something you could

1510
02:10:35,086 --> 02:10:37,542
[SPEAKER_16]: Right, just provide the new plan how it looks like.

1511
02:11:05,047 --> 02:11:12,709
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not sure which one of these is the best one to show for your benefit, but I can slowly scroll through them if you want me to stop.

1512
02:11:14,430 --> 02:11:20,852
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and then maybe you could just tell us what we're looking at and Dennis can... That's the front of, if you look at that, that's the front of the house.

1513
02:11:21,672 --> 02:11:26,974
[SPEAKER_16]: And the side of it is the entrance to go up to the first floor and then you continue to the second floor.

1514
02:11:27,814 --> 02:11:34,316
[SPEAKER_16]: And then if you go into that little sunroom, then that'll be the entrance to the first floor and stairs going up to the second floor.

1515
02:11:36,783 --> 02:11:38,824
[SPEAKER_16]: And the layout of the house is the same.

1516
02:11:39,564 --> 02:11:48,628
[SPEAKER_16]: First and second floor, you'll have a, you'll walk into the kitchen, then you have a dining room or living room behind it, then a full bath and two bedrooms in the back.

1517
02:11:51,249 --> 02:11:54,070
[SPEAKER_16]: And pretty much the same layout for the first and the second floor.

1518
02:11:54,131 --> 02:12:01,113
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1519
02:12:03,374 --> 02:12:04,495
[SPEAKER_09]: Questions from the board?

1520
02:12:09,054 --> 02:12:09,374
[SPEAKER_05]: Chris?

1521
02:12:11,816 --> 02:12:17,401
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, I'm having trouble pulling up my version of the application.

1522
02:12:17,421 --> 02:12:22,344
[SPEAKER_05]: How much direct dimensional relief are we talking about, if any?

1523
02:12:24,226 --> 02:12:27,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Or is it all setback?

1524
02:12:27,908 --> 02:12:34,974
[SPEAKER_09]: So if I'm reading it correctly, Chris, the lot area is 3,300 square foot.

1525
02:12:37,749 --> 02:12:46,452
[SPEAKER_09]: And required is, it looks like it says 10,000, I think it's 6,000, but that's what I saw in the table of use.

1526
02:12:47,813 --> 02:12:48,233
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

1527
02:12:48,393 --> 02:12:49,633
[SPEAKER_09]: It's 3300 right now.

1528
02:12:50,433 --> 02:12:51,414
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1529
02:12:52,734 --> 02:12:52,934
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1530
02:12:52,974 --> 02:12:57,936
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, um, in the current use, which is a single family, the required is 5,000.

1531
02:12:57,976 --> 02:13:01,057
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and then additionally, the.

1532
02:13:05,111 --> 02:13:06,592
[SPEAKER_09]: Lot frontage required is 50.

1533
02:13:06,852 --> 02:13:15,679
[SPEAKER_09]: And the... Wait, did I do that right?

1534
02:13:15,899 --> 02:13:20,342
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's... Yeah, the required is 50, it's 35.

1535
02:13:20,522 --> 02:13:23,485
[SPEAKER_09]: The required width is 100, it's 35.

1536
02:13:23,525 --> 02:13:24,405
[SPEAKER_09]: The required depth is 103.84.

1537
02:13:36,132 --> 02:13:45,555
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, in terms of the ones that would actually change the- so I think the frontage is actually supposed to be 35.

1538
02:13:46,315 --> 02:13:48,696
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I'm seeing in the table of dimensional requirements.

1539
02:13:50,596 --> 02:13:56,998
[SPEAKER_09]: So the change in use imposes an additional requirement of 1,000 feet from 5,000 to 6,000.

1540
02:13:57,078 --> 02:13:57,158
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1541
02:13:57,178 --> 02:13:59,799
[SPEAKER_09]: Then in terms of the width 50 to 60 and the depth from,

1542
02:14:05,464 --> 02:14:08,306
[SPEAKER_09]: 55 to 60.

1543
02:14:10,768 --> 02:14:12,809
[SPEAKER_09]: Variance is required for lot area.

1544
02:14:13,650 --> 02:14:14,290
[SPEAKER_09]: It's 3,300 versus the now 6,000.

1545
02:14:14,330 --> 02:14:15,111
[SPEAKER_09]: The frontage looks okay.

1546
02:14:15,291 --> 02:14:20,235
[SPEAKER_09]: The depth, it's 35, used to need to be 50, now it needs to be 60.

1547
02:14:20,935 --> 02:14:22,857
[SPEAKER_09]: The depth is fine.

1548
02:14:32,739 --> 02:14:35,640
[SPEAKER_09]: I may have missed something in my summary, but high level that's.

1549
02:14:35,920 --> 02:14:38,861
[SPEAKER_09]: And the height, do you know about the height?

1550
02:14:41,822 --> 02:14:42,362
[SPEAKER_09]: Height.

1551
02:14:43,362 --> 02:14:49,144
[SPEAKER_09]: So the height is 31.35 foot.

1552
02:14:49,844 --> 02:14:54,446
[SPEAKER_09]: And the height... Proposed height is 31.

1553
02:14:54,706 --> 02:14:56,607
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's the proposed height, yeah.

1554
02:14:56,727 --> 02:14:57,827
[SPEAKER_09]: And the allowed...

1555
02:14:59,660 --> 02:15:00,080
[SPEAKER_09]: Height is 35.

1556
02:15:00,160 --> 02:15:02,082
[SPEAKER_09]: So height is five.

1557
02:15:02,342 --> 02:15:02,562
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1558
02:15:03,122 --> 02:15:03,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1559
02:15:03,543 --> 02:15:05,444
[SPEAKER_05]: That, that was, that was good.

1560
02:15:05,504 --> 02:15:05,824
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1561
02:15:05,964 --> 02:15:09,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, that's essentially what I was curious about.

1562
02:15:09,546 --> 02:15:22,415
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like a question, I guess, for the applicant is you're going to build a basement level with perhaps, uh, doesn't exist right now.

1563
02:15:22,515 --> 02:15:23,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Or is that, is that what I'm saying?

1564
02:15:23,776 --> 02:15:25,157
[SPEAKER_16]: It's already existing right now.

1565
02:15:25,877 --> 02:15:27,158
[SPEAKER_16]: Like what you see on the plan.

1566
02:15:27,870 --> 02:15:29,270
[SPEAKER_16]: That's just the plan.

1567
02:15:29,831 --> 02:15:35,452
[SPEAKER_16]: It's already been built based on the level, first floor and second floor as a single family.

1568
02:15:35,472 --> 02:15:38,693
[SPEAKER_16]: It's already been approved and built.

1569
02:15:39,093 --> 02:15:42,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I'm seeing it on the map that I'm pulling up.

1570
02:15:42,054 --> 02:15:46,835
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it looks like there is not a basement level, but.

1571
02:15:49,116 --> 02:15:51,937
[SPEAKER_16]: No, you do have, you walk if you go back to that map.

1572
02:16:04,505 --> 02:16:05,326
[SPEAKER_09]: You're on mute, Edmund.

1573
02:16:08,087 --> 02:16:08,387
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry.

1574
02:16:09,508 --> 02:16:14,791
[SPEAKER_16]: So you do have a beta from the front, and then on the side of the stairs, you go up to the first floor, then the second floor.

1575
02:16:17,132 --> 02:16:17,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1576
02:16:17,532 --> 02:16:19,413
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's what's there currently?

1577
02:16:19,953 --> 02:16:20,193
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

1578
02:16:20,213 --> 02:16:22,975
All right.

1579
02:16:23,775 --> 02:16:31,439
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't see that on the map that I'm looking at, but maybe I'm looking at the wrong building, perhaps.

1580
02:16:38,745 --> 02:16:40,169
[SPEAKER_09]: Dennis, you had your hand up.

1581
02:16:41,272 --> 02:16:43,017
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you like to share something?

1582
02:16:45,992 --> 02:16:48,474
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, it was just while you were working through the dimensional stuff.

1583
02:16:49,315 --> 02:17:00,323
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, you basically got it right that it's by going from a single to a two, the lot area goes from 5,000 to 6,000, and the lot width goes from 50 feet to 60 feet.

1584
02:17:00,404 --> 02:17:04,767
[SPEAKER_18]: Those are the two things that they need to get the variances on.

1585
02:17:05,107 --> 02:17:09,171
[SPEAKER_18]: Everything else is within acceptable numbers.

1586
02:17:11,212 --> 02:17:11,452
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1587
02:17:12,013 --> 02:17:12,553
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Dennis.

1588
02:17:12,954 --> 02:17:14,455
[SPEAKER_09]: Other questions from the board?

1589
02:17:15,887 --> 02:17:19,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I just want to make sure I heard the structure.

1590
02:17:19,230 --> 02:17:21,152
[SPEAKER_04]: Second floor is already completed built.

1591
02:17:21,792 --> 02:17:22,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that what you're saying?

1592
02:17:22,773 --> 02:17:23,274
[SPEAKER_04]: What you said?

1593
02:17:24,755 --> 02:17:25,015
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

1594
02:17:26,477 --> 02:17:26,617
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1595
02:17:26,637 --> 02:17:28,839
[SPEAKER_09]: So Mary, my originally, sorry.

1596
02:17:29,059 --> 02:17:30,060
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.

1597
02:17:30,601 --> 02:17:32,943
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just going to say, and please chime in Edmund.

1598
02:17:33,103 --> 02:17:38,568
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I think it's an alternate configuration of thing structure.

1599
02:17:39,728 --> 02:17:50,580
[SPEAKER_09]: that would make it a two-family, and it does not change the footprint in any way of the existing, it does require some modifications for egress and so on.

1600
02:17:51,461 --> 02:17:52,623
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, okay.

1601
02:17:56,467 --> 02:17:59,511
[SPEAKER_09]: Other questions on the board?

1602
02:18:01,163 --> 02:18:08,207
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I'm just trying to, you know, look on the map and the different angles of these, of the property.

1603
02:18:08,287 --> 02:18:16,971
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm just, it looks so close to the adjacent properties that I'm, can you just explain again how the.

1604
02:18:17,011 --> 02:18:23,474
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, it's, I don't know how to explain it.

1605
02:18:23,555 --> 02:18:25,215
[SPEAKER_16]: It's five feet from the other property.

1606
02:18:25,255 --> 02:18:25,996
[SPEAKER_16]: It used to be single.

1607
02:18:26,016 --> 02:18:29,978
[SPEAKER_16]: We use the same footprint and instead of having one level and one up to two levels.

1608
02:18:31,332 --> 02:18:31,612
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.

1609
02:18:31,833 --> 02:18:35,157
[SPEAKER_11]: And that, but, and what was that permit to go from one level?

1610
02:18:35,978 --> 02:18:44,287
[SPEAKER_16]: It used to be just one level single family and the permit gave us the okay to make a single family, two levels.

1611
02:18:44,928 --> 02:18:48,292
[SPEAKER_11]: That was the, that was just like, just through the building.

1612
02:18:48,933 --> 02:18:49,193
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.

1613
02:18:50,535 --> 02:18:50,755
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.

1614
02:18:53,298 --> 02:18:58,024
[SPEAKER_16]: They got converted from single family, one level to single family, two levels.

1615
02:18:58,785 --> 02:18:58,925
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1616
02:18:58,945 --> 02:18:59,766
[SPEAKER_16]: So Andre,
