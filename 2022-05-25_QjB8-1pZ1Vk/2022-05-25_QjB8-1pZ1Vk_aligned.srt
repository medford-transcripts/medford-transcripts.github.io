1
00:00:00,331 --> 00:00:00,451
Yep.

2
00:00:01,372 --> 00:00:01,712
Thank you.

3
00:00:05,415 --> 00:00:10,500
Good afternoon, since the recording has begun and the four o'clock has arrived.

4
00:00:11,901 --> 00:00:12,601
Welcome, everyone.

5
00:00:12,621 --> 00:00:22,630
I'm going to call to order the rules and policies subcommittee meeting for May 25th at 4pm.

6
00:00:24,671 --> 00:00:28,775
Please be advised that on May 25th, I want my screen zoom.

7
00:00:30,688 --> 00:00:30,988
Sorry.

8
00:00:31,888 --> 00:00:42,892
Anyways, please be advised that on May 25 2022 from four to 5pm there will be a rules and policies subcommittee meeting held through remote participation via zoom.

9
00:00:44,793 --> 00:00:50,334
The meeting can be viewed through network community media on Comcast channel 22 and Verizon channel 43 at 4pm.

10
00:00:52,787 --> 00:00:59,552
Since the meeting will be held remotely, participants can log or call in by using the link https://nps02155-org.zoom.us slash j slash 95821066679.

Those submitting must include the following information, your first and last name, your Medford Street address, and your question or comment.

16
00:01:44,865 --> 00:01:57,147
The agenda for tonight is, as approved by the committee on October 18th, 2021, the Rules, Policy, and Equity Subcommittee will draft a student dress code JICA policy for the Medford Public Schools.

17
00:01:57,687 --> 00:02:01,608
The policy recommendation will be returned to the school committee no later than February 28th, 2022.

18
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:09,750
The subcommittee will hold at least two meetings on this topic before sending a recommended policy to the school committee.

19
00:02:11,742 --> 00:02:29,715
outreach to stakeholders will be made by the superintendent or her designee to ensure the subcommittee hears from students, teachers, and principals, the Mystic Valley NAACP, SAFE Medford, Interfaith Clergy Association of Medford, and any other advocacy group in Medford that may have an interest in this work.

20
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:37,815
will be notified prior to these meetings as we embark on our efforts to create a just equitable and inclusive student dress code.

21
00:02:38,415 --> 00:02:39,976
I'm going to call the roll.

22
00:02:39,996 --> 00:02:47,820
First, I'd like to apologize that I am still having some shortness of breath and coughing from my COVID infection from two weeks ago.

23
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,341
So forgive my shortness of breath and coughing all over the meeting.

24
00:02:56,724 --> 00:02:57,325
Member Graham.

25
00:03:00,542 --> 00:03:01,382
Member McLaughlin?

26
00:03:02,042 --> 00:03:02,343
Yeah.

27
00:03:03,243 --> 00:03:07,144
Member Russo here, present and absent.

28
00:03:19,267 --> 00:03:23,488
So we've had two meetings on this so far and hopefully this will be the last one.

29
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,640
since that February 28th date.

30
00:03:28,301 --> 00:03:29,541
I don't remember writing that down.

31
00:03:29,601 --> 00:03:32,361
I guess I should have been a little more generous with the time.

32
00:03:32,841 --> 00:03:43,724
But we have, if there's nobody who has a different idea, I'm going to share the current policy that we have been drafting.

33
00:03:44,784 --> 00:03:51,005
And then I'm going to review some of the recommendations that I've received from administration, and we can discuss those.

34
00:03:52,205 --> 00:03:55,546
And are there any, let's see.

35
00:03:57,378 --> 00:04:13,485
And for any of the public that is present on the meeting, if you want to speak or comment, don't hesitate to raise your hand through the chat, through the reactions, or wave, and one of us, I'm sure, will notice what I'm sharing.

36
00:04:13,525 --> 00:04:16,627
I probably won't be able to see that myself, but let's see.

37
00:04:25,602 --> 00:04:31,444
And feel free, Paul, if it's too much with the coughing or whatever, if you want one of us to read, we're happy to do that.

38
00:04:32,664 --> 00:04:33,385
Thank you very much.

39
00:04:33,405 --> 00:04:45,489
Yeah, I'm not going, since this is our third meeting, I'm not going to read the whole policy again, as we have seen it for a little bit.

40
00:04:46,969 --> 00:04:48,390
So I did look at the,

41
00:04:50,253 --> 00:05:03,398
feedback from the assistant superintendents, and I put some of them in here, the ones that I thought we certainly will want to adopt, and then the other ones I think we can talk about and get to that.

42
00:05:04,998 --> 00:05:06,859
So under the

43
00:05:10,436 --> 00:05:18,380
Under the universal dress code, the policy permits additional student attire requirements when necessary to ensure safety in certain academic settings.

44
00:05:19,621 --> 00:05:25,723
Physical activity was changed to physical education, which I think, does anybody have a problem with that?

45
00:05:25,743 --> 00:05:28,085
Nope.

46
00:05:28,365 --> 00:05:31,866
And then, so I'm just going to mark that as accepted.

47
00:05:34,247 --> 00:05:44,290
Further down, this was a rewording by assistant superintendent, Suzanne Colussy.

48
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:47,111
And I actually liked this.

49
00:05:47,411 --> 00:05:57,674
It used to just say principles are required to ensure that all staff are aware of and understand the guidelines of this policy.

50
00:05:58,194 --> 00:06:01,975
I actually liked that she inserted the core values and associated guidelines

51
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:07,652
Because the core values really are the driver, frankly.

52
00:06:08,552 --> 00:06:10,473
Is everybody able to see this, or is it too small?

53
00:06:10,573 --> 00:06:11,353
I apologize.

54
00:06:11,373 --> 00:06:13,514
I have no idea what it's like for you all.

55
00:06:14,334 --> 00:06:15,374
Can you make it a little bit bigger?

56
00:06:16,215 --> 00:06:16,795
I sure can.

57
00:06:16,815 --> 00:06:20,696
Let's see.

58
00:06:22,397 --> 00:06:22,797
How's that?

59
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:25,978
Did it actually get bigger for you?

60
00:06:26,518 --> 00:06:26,918
OK, good.

61
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:27,679
Yeah.

62
00:06:27,939 --> 00:06:30,980
So barring any

63
00:06:32,323 --> 00:06:34,404
Anybody have any problem with adding that and serving those?

64
00:06:38,066 --> 00:06:38,826
Hearing none.

65
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:47,930
This I also really appreciated as less wordy than the old version or harder to understand.

66
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:50,111
Staff will use reasonable effort to avoid

67
00:06:51,068 --> 00:06:54,970
Dress coding students in front of other students is what it said before.

68
00:06:56,111 --> 00:06:59,993
To avoid issuing dress code discipline to individuals in front of other students.

69
00:07:00,233 --> 00:07:02,935
I think that's nice and clear.

70
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:04,075
Any thoughts?

71
00:07:06,897 --> 00:07:07,637
That makes sense to me.

72
00:07:08,558 --> 00:07:09,558
Great.

73
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:19,504
And I don't remember who suggested this, but changing from should to will.

74
00:07:20,805 --> 00:07:22,065
definitely think that's good.

75
00:07:23,126 --> 00:07:26,646
We don't really want to have problems that fester.

76
00:07:26,826 --> 00:07:31,788
And then, you know, when the parent finds out for the first time, it's actually the ninth time that it's been a problem.

77
00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:35,769
So, and I know that can that can happen.

78
00:07:36,049 --> 00:07:38,469
There's a lot going on in everybody's day.

79
00:07:38,689 --> 00:07:42,230
But I think that makes it clear.

80
00:07:48,792 --> 00:07:50,432
Anybody have other comments on that one?

81
00:07:50,472 --> 00:07:50,552
No.

82
00:07:53,548 --> 00:07:54,108
Okay, let's hear.

83
00:07:54,949 --> 00:07:56,089
Great, thank you.

84
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:02,631
So we also, I think this was just left, the word may should be there.

85
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:08,133
Makes more sense, sounds like English.

86
00:08:09,793 --> 00:08:20,417
Now I'd like to go up and grab the, can you all see the new tab that I just opened up?

87
00:08:22,834 --> 00:08:24,014
Excellent, great.

88
00:08:24,614 --> 00:08:30,996
So one of the suggestions was to change marginalization to marginalize.

89
00:08:31,336 --> 00:08:34,837
I actually like the use of the word marginalization.

90
00:08:34,877 --> 00:08:46,579
I know that has been a relatively, in the last few years, there's been some efforts to change the way we talk about the non-dominant groups.

91
00:08:48,279 --> 00:09:03,770
And instead of labeling them as if there's some kind of deficiency, and instead putting the fact that they are being marginalized on the dominant group that's doing the marginal, I mean, a non-dominant group doesn't marginalize itself.

92
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:09,875
It's being marginalized by the dominant group, if it is in fact being marginalized.

93
00:09:09,915 --> 00:09:12,577
And obviously that's not required.

94
00:09:13,658 --> 00:09:16,640
So I like the use of the word marginalization to make it clear.

95
00:09:18,127 --> 00:09:19,388
that it's an active thing.

96
00:09:19,408 --> 00:09:21,289
I agree.

97
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:23,291
Okay.

98
00:09:24,732 --> 00:09:28,535
This one, so this one here, recess.

99
00:09:28,555 --> 00:09:32,238
I agree and I have concerns.

100
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:42,467
I 100% agree that, you know, especially obviously at the elementary level, I suppose at the middle level as well, but at the elementary level,

101
00:09:44,201 --> 00:09:50,747
We don't want teachers sending kids out in flip-flops and shorts when it's 20 degrees outside.

102
00:09:50,767 --> 00:09:55,811
I assume we would still go out for recess when it's 20 degrees.

103
00:09:56,771 --> 00:10:10,263
So on principle, I agree that there needs to be some level of, when appropriate, some level of adult decision-making and whether or not a student is dressed appropriately for recess.

104
00:10:11,724 --> 00:10:12,845
My hesitation, though,

105
00:10:13,928 --> 00:10:21,093
is that recess continues to be used as something that's taken for disciplinary reasons.

106
00:10:21,213 --> 00:10:30,919
And I don't see how this and discipline don't really come together in this point, but I just worry about any other reason why kids wouldn't get recess.

107
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:38,304
And for those of us that are parents, looking at this list, many of us are parents,

108
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:53,032
we've, I don't know if it's a gender free issue, but certainly, you know, with my own son, I've seen him happy to go outside in the middle of the winter, frankly, and just barely more than flip flops and shorts.

109
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:54,533
And he doesn't get cold.

110
00:10:54,953 --> 00:10:56,293
And I'm horrified.

111
00:10:57,593 --> 00:11:05,235
But I guess I'm just, what do people think about this?

112
00:11:05,275 --> 00:11:07,635
I mean, we have to recognize that this is also for elementary

113
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:13,612
and anybody wanna talk about this?

114
00:11:15,973 --> 00:11:16,273
Paul?

115
00:11:16,973 --> 00:11:17,153
Yes.

116
00:11:17,213 --> 00:11:18,194
I was wondering if Ms.

117
00:11:18,214 --> 00:11:21,916
Galusti wanted to share some of her thoughts about that.

118
00:11:23,216 --> 00:11:23,996
That would be great.

119
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:28,619
Sure, sorry, I'm in a remote satellite location here.

120
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:38,343
I think for me, yes, I understand that this dress code is gonna serve pre-K to grade 12, and so,

121
00:11:39,518 --> 00:11:52,729
I don't know about the specificity that you want to get to but I think when we're talking about young students so right now, what the policy is at the elementary level is that we do outdoor recess.

122
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:54,771
If the real feel is.

123
00:11:57,562 --> 00:12:00,303
above 25 degrees or higher.

124
00:12:00,983 --> 00:12:17,849
So students need to make sure that they, you know, we have, schools have ways to make sure that if students need additional clothing or if things are needed so that they can participate in recess, that's provided.

125
00:12:18,049 --> 00:12:24,272
But I think in terms of students playing on play structures and being warm enough,

126
00:12:26,653 --> 00:12:39,217
Some of the pieces for me is just to make sure that students have the proper attire to be able to participate outdoors in a safe manner, which is the only reason why I had those two pieces on there.

127
00:12:40,318 --> 00:12:40,538
Sure.

128
00:12:40,738 --> 00:12:45,839
No, I mean, I can't imagine why we wouldn't agree on that point.

129
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,820
And I guess the recess.

130
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,080
I'm sorry.

131
00:12:55,109 --> 00:12:58,551
I couldn't hear you, member Russo.

132
00:12:58,991 --> 00:13:01,973
Can everybody else hear me?

133
00:13:02,253 --> 00:13:02,613
Yes.

134
00:13:04,554 --> 00:13:05,275
Sorry, Suzanne.

135
00:13:05,415 --> 00:13:06,055
It's just you.

136
00:13:07,456 --> 00:13:08,476
Oh, I apologize.

137
00:13:08,656 --> 00:13:09,797
I apologize.

138
00:13:10,938 --> 00:13:20,163
So I find what just dawned on me that we did just send the recess policy to this subcommittee, I think at the last meeting.

139
00:13:20,323 --> 00:13:23,845
So we can sort of cover any kind of,

140
00:13:25,052 --> 00:13:31,934
overlapping issues around recess and this policy when we do the recess policy.

141
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:36,775
So I'm fine with adding it in if the other members are as well.

142
00:13:40,176 --> 00:13:40,636
I'm with me.

143
00:13:41,357 --> 00:13:42,137
Yeah, I agree.

144
00:13:43,017 --> 00:13:49,279
Okay, now we just have to figure out how to say it because, where was it?

145
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,140
I'm just gonna put academic settings

146
00:13:53,633 --> 00:14:04,916
I would like to call academic settings recess to be academic settings, but Desi is adamant that it doesn't want to count recess as a part of the academic day, much to my chagrin.

147
00:14:05,756 --> 00:14:08,217
So I feel like it's important to put it like.

148
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:20,260
Yeah, does that look okay, everybody?

149
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:21,680
Thank you.

150
00:14:23,548 --> 00:14:25,290
No, thank you for thinking of it.

151
00:14:28,293 --> 00:14:30,035
That was just the original one.

152
00:14:30,055 --> 00:14:32,337
I actually had said they may wear all of these things.

153
00:14:32,417 --> 00:14:33,198
So I fixed that.

154
00:14:34,459 --> 00:14:35,560
We fixed that at the last meeting.

155
00:14:36,581 --> 00:14:43,708
So profanity is the one addition that on principle, I'm actually completely agree.

156
00:14:44,729 --> 00:14:46,731
But my understanding of the,

157
00:14:47,986 --> 00:15:02,389
case that really put a lot of this in motion in Massachusetts was around profanity on attire, in which case, in the Supreme Judicial Court said, we cannot restrict that.

158
00:15:02,409 --> 00:15:15,552
I really don't think that, just to be clear, I don't want a future where every kid is walking around with gigantic swears emblazoned on everything that they own.

159
00:15:18,087 --> 00:15:25,813
it's not the kind of school I would like to be, have gone to, and certainly, obviously our staff and many of our students would not appreciate it.

160
00:15:27,294 --> 00:15:41,924
On the other hand, given what the case, as JC said, I feel like we should leave out explicit language that is the opposite of what they have stated.

161
00:15:42,344 --> 00:15:46,127
So I'm not suggesting we add anything in here that says you can wear swears on your

162
00:15:46,671 --> 00:16:06,109
profanity on your outfits, but I think we don't want to get into a conversation or with our new policy immediately being somebody suggesting that it was, we just drafted it and we, these meetings are recorded and we purposefully just decided to go against what the court said.

163
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:11,554
So that's my opinion on why I didn't suggest adding it in.

164
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:12,755
What do others think?

165
00:16:17,913 --> 00:16:19,694
I'll go ahead.

166
00:16:19,954 --> 00:16:22,895
I think, leaving the word in is good.

167
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:35,620
I think what we would just need is some guidelines like that central administration would give the principles, so that you know everybody sort of on the same page because the problem with the profanity is it's.

168
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,601
what we've talked about before, it's a little ambiguous, right?

169
00:16:39,522 --> 00:16:43,264
You could deem something profane different than I deem it profane.

170
00:16:44,264 --> 00:16:54,570
And then we run into, and I agree with you, like the case law, we've talked about this before, like, we don't wanna also do that, but I think policy and protocol are two different things.

171
00:16:55,210 --> 00:17:03,495
So if we come, this becomes part of the policy, I think it's good, but then we have a protocol of like certain words that,

172
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:11,979
there's an agreement upon that we would consider to be profane that would cause an enforcement of the policy.

173
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:13,500
Does that make sense kind of thing?

174
00:17:15,521 --> 00:17:17,122
It makes some sense to me.

175
00:17:17,262 --> 00:17:23,765
I mean, there was certainly a time when if queer had been on an outfit, it would have qualified as profane.

176
00:17:24,786 --> 00:17:32,830
And if we were to have dress coded somebody for having queer on an outfit today, I might call the Boston Globe on the school system.

177
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:45,084
what is profane both changes as well as does have an unfortunately large amount of room for interpretation.

178
00:17:46,405 --> 00:17:56,209
There are plenty of people who still think queer and gay and certainly other words are not, like, it's not uncommon

179
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:07,378
in my day-to-day life, frankly, for people to whisper gay when they're suggesting somebody might be gay, as if there's something profane or wrong.

180
00:18:08,059 --> 00:18:15,025
And I just, who's gonna be the arbiter of this?

181
00:18:16,085 --> 00:18:23,151
And from an implementation perspective, every single teacher, staff member who,

182
00:18:24,738 --> 00:18:27,139
see something and wonders, is this profane?

183
00:18:28,379 --> 00:18:32,921
There's not like a hotline you can call and get an answer right away from Maurice or whoever.

184
00:18:32,941 --> 00:18:35,181
This is on the profane list.

185
00:18:35,221 --> 00:18:36,602
This is not on the profane list.

186
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:47,905
And more importantly, there's going to be, you know, it's frankly, you know, it's the FCUK, the brand of clothing.

187
00:18:48,106 --> 00:18:51,567
I mean, it's a brand of clothing only because of

188
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:54,592
actually I don't know for a fact.

189
00:18:54,652 --> 00:18:56,995
It's FCK, it's not FC.

190
00:18:57,916 --> 00:18:59,898
Okay, but thank you.

191
00:19:00,019 --> 00:19:04,545
But I mean you know what it is, but obviously it's they took out the U, right?

192
00:19:05,326 --> 00:19:11,514
Yeah, and I feel a bit concerned that we're going to get into

193
00:19:13,784 --> 00:19:14,244
battles.

194
00:19:14,925 --> 00:19:25,074
One of the reasons we're here is that from staff member to staff member, school to school, what was considered a violation of the dress code changes day to day.

195
00:19:25,094 --> 00:19:27,596
Paul, Ms.

196
00:19:27,696 --> 00:19:29,978
Galussi and Mr. Cushing have their hands up.

197
00:19:30,379 --> 00:19:31,320
Dr. Cushing.

198
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,401
Ms.

199
00:19:32,481 --> 00:19:33,802
Galussi, I'm sorry, you were first, I think.

200
00:19:35,425 --> 00:19:37,627
That's okay, I just wanted to clarify a few things.

201
00:19:39,468 --> 00:19:45,933
I'm not as less, I'm not as tied to the word profanity as maybe I am about swear words.

202
00:19:46,493 --> 00:19:54,880
And again, I think I'm coming at this looking at an elementary lens as well, though I do have two high school students myself.

203
00:19:56,561 --> 00:20:04,247
But part of the work that I did with my principals was just to go through this proposal and make sure that I got

204
00:20:05,118 --> 00:20:07,800
you know, input from the principals in the buildings.

205
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:18,566
And for me, I think I want to ensure that students are not coming to school, especially at my level, wearing clothing with swear words on them.

206
00:20:18,626 --> 00:20:32,074
So I wanted to clarify that profanity to me has nothing to do with the examples you gave and everything to do with what I guess we could clarify instead of profanity as swear words.

207
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:38,153
swear words simply had all the vowels taken out.

208
00:20:39,114 --> 00:20:41,877
Every adult knows what it says.

209
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:43,619
Is that a swear word?

210
00:20:43,639 --> 00:20:48,244
I mean, this is real life.

211
00:20:48,284 --> 00:20:49,105
This is going to happen.

212
00:20:49,245 --> 00:20:50,727
You know for a fact that's going to happen.

213
00:20:51,508 --> 00:20:53,410
So is it a swear word or not?

214
00:20:55,054 --> 00:20:59,395
It is, sorry, I apologize.

215
00:20:59,495 --> 00:21:06,117
It is still the example that you gave where they did the letter reversal.

216
00:21:07,177 --> 00:21:13,999
And I think, I don't know, maybe it's the teacher in me, but all of a sudden you find yourself putting the letters in the proper order.

217
00:21:14,479 --> 00:21:18,901
So you're kind of like swearing at yourself, like after you say it quickly.

218
00:21:19,501 --> 00:21:22,682
But I don't know if,

219
00:21:24,906 --> 00:21:28,147
When I see the word profanity, I'm thinking of swear words.

220
00:21:30,928 --> 00:21:45,814
But as you were saying, Member Russo, each decade, there were certain words that it's acceptable one year, and then the next year, all of a sudden, it becomes an offensive term or word because the young people have changed the meaning of it.

221
00:21:45,934 --> 00:21:47,975
And so it has multiple meanings.

222
00:21:48,796 --> 00:21:54,378
And so I'm trying to think of

223
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:20,159
what could be, I don't know if we could say based on the time period, but as you were saying, words have multiple meanings and there's a lot of clothing out there and different vendors that are making things that either there are symbols that are clearly inappropriate or again, letter reversals.

224
00:22:20,259 --> 00:22:24,263
So it's not technically a swear that you're reading, but

225
00:22:25,003 --> 00:22:28,446
If you, you know what it, you know what the intent is.

226
00:22:29,106 --> 00:22:32,269
And so, just trying to limit that.

227
00:22:32,289 --> 00:22:39,615
So I just wanted to say whether it's a swear word or not but the word, you know,

228
00:22:40,914 --> 00:22:53,982
That other company where they did the letter reversal next year, it can be a new word, you know, that is all of a sudden it's the new word, like everyone's using, you know, fire.

229
00:22:54,002 --> 00:22:55,143
Oh, that's hot.

230
00:22:55,263 --> 00:22:55,803
It's fire.

231
00:22:55,883 --> 00:22:56,424
It's fire.

232
00:22:57,024 --> 00:23:04,849
Next year, the word fire could be considered a curse word because the young people just change it and give it a different meaning.

233
00:23:05,449 --> 00:23:08,511
So I don't know if there's a way to

234
00:23:15,806 --> 00:23:17,788
I guess some of it's objective.

235
00:23:18,548 --> 00:23:29,297
I'm stuck because I'm saying, I don't know if it should be language that could be perceived as offensive at the time, but it's going to continue to evolve and change.

236
00:23:29,957 --> 00:23:33,760
So I feel like that word is a moving target.

237
00:23:36,202 --> 00:23:38,244
I don't know if I'm really helping the conversation at all.

238
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:39,344
You are.

239
00:23:39,645 --> 00:23:45,069
It's a moving target is a great way to look at it also because what isn't a moving target though?

240
00:23:46,702 --> 00:23:48,764
I'll count myself amongst the old people here.

241
00:23:50,785 --> 00:24:07,156
Our idea of these kinds of things, except for those of us that are really attuned to pop culture, and I think, I don't know if any of us are, our idea is relatively static or stagnant from a formative point in our life.

242
00:24:08,377 --> 00:24:13,460
And so the people that will be enforcing what is profane

243
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:20,745
will almost by definition have to have a different idea of it than the students.

244
00:24:23,547 --> 00:24:36,318
So, I mean, other than in Milford or Milton or wherever it is where the 19 year old is on the school committee, most of us are not going to have a good, have a sense of this stuff that is helpful.

245
00:24:36,759 --> 00:24:37,259
Dr. Cushing.

246
00:24:45,625 --> 00:24:45,905
Peter.

247
00:24:47,226 --> 00:24:53,170
Your hand's up.

248
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:54,290
I'll come back to Peter.

249
00:24:55,231 --> 00:24:56,892
Melanie, Member McLaughlin?

250
00:24:59,073 --> 00:25:05,317
Yeah, I mean, I think that we're having a good conversation here, but I think that we're talking about two different things, if I might.

251
00:25:05,397 --> 00:25:13,162
I think on one hand, if I'm hearing correctly, on the one hand, I'm hearing Member Rousseau talking about

252
00:25:14,751 --> 00:25:16,252
What's legally permissible.

253
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:25,316
And on the other hand, I'm hearing us talk about what Medford score values are so I think there's two different things that we're talking about we should tease those out a little bit.

254
00:25:26,336 --> 00:25:33,339
And so, you know, to what point is this policy is it you know what's legally permissible or is it.

255
00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:38,223
You know Medford public schools policy and so I think sort of answering that question might be helpful.

256
00:25:38,663 --> 00:25:43,327
And then just in terms of this particular word, you know profanity or whatever.

257
00:25:43,347 --> 00:25:48,050
I think, you know, a workaround could potentially be, you know, deemed offensive.

258
00:25:48,831 --> 00:25:51,552
you know, are pornographic contained threats deemed offensive?

259
00:25:52,612 --> 00:26:06,078
And so deemed offensive, I know, is a little bit looser than profanity, but deemed offensive, maybe we have some definition of, you know, further definition of what's deemed offensive or deemed offensive, you know, by, I don't know, central administrator or something.

260
00:26:06,138 --> 00:26:17,442
But if profanity is clearly not the legal term, because, you know, there was a ruling that says that that's not the issue, I think, you know, we have to think about, again, what's Medford's

261
00:26:18,569 --> 00:26:29,113
core value and policy around this and what is, you know, the legal piece and whether or not it gets challenged legally is another, you know, is a conversation, I guess, for another day.

262
00:26:29,213 --> 00:26:40,057
But I think if we focus more specifically, I guess it's a fine line, but I would say we should focus more specifically on what Medford's core values are and what we wanna say here.

263
00:26:40,197 --> 00:26:46,479
And then, you know, the legal piece can, you know, either be vetted through our attorney and or, you know,

264
00:26:47,219 --> 00:26:48,420
whether or not there's a lawsuit.

265
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:57,503
But if we know specifically profanity, then maybe we just want to think about a different way of wording that and deem defensive potentially, you know, could be it.

266
00:26:57,683 --> 00:26:58,003
I don't know.

267
00:26:58,764 --> 00:26:59,124
Thanks.

268
00:27:00,184 --> 00:27:00,524
Thank you.

269
00:27:00,644 --> 00:27:03,706
Member Graham.

270
00:27:04,346 --> 00:27:06,967
I was curious if you could tell us

271
00:27:08,782 --> 00:27:24,850
in summary, specifically what the Supreme Judicial Court ruled, because I feel like we're trying to talk ourselves into doing something that's explicitly the opposite of what the Supreme Judicial Court told us was permissible.

272
00:27:27,171 --> 00:27:34,915
So I hope that Peter's internet's good enough, because I don't know why I don't have that actually open as a tab.

273
00:27:35,275 --> 00:27:36,176
I'm not gonna hit Google.

274
00:27:41,361 --> 00:28:03,532
Was this the one, Peter, is this the case where, you know, one of the nicknames for Richard is often considered as, you know, everybody seems to have an Uncle Dick, but if you put that on your shirt, was that this case?

275
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:06,314
I wish Peter's internet was better.

276
00:28:11,796 --> 00:28:17,221
I can Google profanity in schools and Supreme Court ruling while you guys continue the discussion, see if that helps.

277
00:28:18,062 --> 00:28:18,422
Thank you.

278
00:28:18,802 --> 00:28:22,526
And we can, we can circle back after Peter's internet stabilizes if it does.

279
00:28:23,747 --> 00:28:28,391
So let me just get to these other things and we'll come back to profanity because Kyle versus South Hadley.

280
00:28:29,232 --> 00:28:29,492
Yes.

281
00:28:30,753 --> 00:28:31,074
Thank you.

282
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:54,503
The clear, unambiguous, and mandatory language of Master in Law, Chapter 71, Section 82, protecting the right of public school students to freedom of expression admits no exception or limitation for arguably vulgar, lewd, or offensive language absent a showing of disruption within the school.

283
00:28:56,204 --> 00:29:00,787
So there is no- Offensive isn't acceptable either.

284
00:29:01,868 --> 00:29:04,309
Yeah, there is no exception to limit

285
00:29:06,235 --> 00:29:08,996
arguably vulgar, lewd, or offensive language.

286
00:29:11,377 --> 00:29:14,639
And I think that the rest of that sentence is sort of the important thing.

287
00:29:15,099 --> 00:29:22,422
So if a student's wearing something, many of us might find vulgar, profane, whatever, offensive.

288
00:29:23,142 --> 00:29:27,644
And the student goes and sits in their chair and classroom operates fine.

289
00:29:29,513 --> 00:29:30,914
then it is not a problem.

290
00:29:31,254 --> 00:29:37,699
And the classroom not operating fine can't be because the teacher's uncomfortable with it.

291
00:29:40,581 --> 00:29:52,629
I mean, if the teacher is the only person who's finding it disruptive, then what I'm hearing when I hear that sentence, it's about whether or not the place could function.

292
00:29:53,838 --> 00:30:04,389
And it can't just be that the staff are the folks who are uncomfortable with it, because, I mean, then we're back to square one, where I don't like red, nobody should wear red in my school.

293
00:30:04,909 --> 00:30:12,517
I mean, that's kind of a crazy example, but it also is what the point of that ruling is.

294
00:30:14,629 --> 00:30:26,138
And I guess from my standpoint, what would constitute disruption at the elementary level is gonna be really quite different than what's gonna constitute disruption at the high school level.

295
00:30:26,879 --> 00:30:42,731
So I think, at the same time, I take exception to the overuse of the idea that clothing is disruptive and I'm not in favor of the actions that I've seen happen under the guise of disruption.

296
00:30:43,492 --> 00:30:54,526
So I wonder if a I wonder if we should circle back to this at the end of the meeting and make our way through the rest of the comments for discussion but but also think about.

297
00:30:56,709 --> 00:31:22,380
you know, maybe there's a separate bullet about profanity that says that it is discouraged and, you know, that the school administration has the right to restrict it in the event that it is disruptive to the school environment with some examples of, you know, what might be permissible in an elementary school versus a high school or something, you know, something that sort of,

298
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:35,889
draws that line out a little bit, but doesn't make it such that, like happens today, everybody gets to decide what they want the dress code to be and enforce it as they see fit.

299
00:31:37,651 --> 00:31:38,231
Thank you.

300
00:31:38,331 --> 00:31:39,412
I think that's a good idea.

301
00:31:39,632 --> 00:31:46,237
Let's hear from Mr. Regan, since his hand is up, before we check out the other stuff and then circle back.

302
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:47,298
Sean.

303
00:31:48,679 --> 00:31:49,179
Oh, thank you.

304
00:31:50,567 --> 00:31:55,510
Sean Biegun, 362 Lawrence Road.

305
00:31:55,690 --> 00:32:03,395
You're dancing around the issue, whether you use profanity, vulgarity, obscenity, whatever it is.

306
00:32:04,306 --> 00:32:16,576
It's a word on the clothing that causes disruption, makes someone uncomfortable, that necessarily is going to have to be in the opinion of the teacher or the administration to make that call.

307
00:32:17,056 --> 00:32:25,283
They're not gonna pull the class and say, is anyone else disturbed by this shirt that says F-U-C-K yourself on it?

308
00:32:27,125 --> 00:32:31,148
I think you're dancing around something or trying to,

309
00:32:32,347 --> 00:32:42,335
I understand what you're trying to do and you're trying to allow for as much freedom of expression as possible and not run afoul of Massachusetts statute.

310
00:32:42,375 --> 00:32:46,918
But honestly, I don't think it's as complicated as you're trying to make it.

311
00:32:48,639 --> 00:32:55,144
You can remove profanity because that seems to be a hot button word that's been challenged before and it's specifically used in that case.

312
00:32:55,184 --> 00:32:58,587
But I think you can throw any other word in there that isn't synonym.

313
00:33:02,012 --> 00:33:07,396
it's obviously gonna come down to the call of the teacher or the staff or the administration or something like that.

314
00:33:07,416 --> 00:33:11,199
And maybe it's gonna be brought to their attention by another student.

315
00:33:11,299 --> 00:33:16,063
Maybe it's just gonna be their calls because it's so over the top and everyone in class is giggling.

316
00:33:16,163 --> 00:33:19,966
I mean, it's gonna be, that seems to me how it works.

317
00:33:20,006 --> 00:33:22,548
That's the stories I hear that come home to my house.

318
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:25,170
Thank you.

319
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:29,614
Dr. Cushing, do you wanna speak before we move on to this?

320
00:33:31,598 --> 00:33:32,631
Oh, audio is connected.

321
00:33:34,322 --> 00:33:38,784
So I apologize for that, trying to get to a place with decent internet connection.

322
00:33:39,364 --> 00:33:45,507
So I would be exceptionally concerned at the secondary schools about not having something in there.

323
00:33:46,448 --> 00:33:50,490
As Attorney Began just mentioned, I was able to catch a little bit of what he mentioned.

324
00:33:51,570 --> 00:34:03,216
And while the South Hadley case and other case law, all right, has placed a higher degree of scrutiny on Massachusetts public schools,

325
00:34:03,896 --> 00:34:12,278
It doesn't necessarily at times limit the ability of the school leadership to make determinations.

326
00:34:12,698 --> 00:34:29,082
And I would be exceptionally concerned that by not saying something around profanity, swear words, or other things, that we would be opening a door that would be extremely difficult to close.

327
00:34:37,332 --> 00:34:40,393
I agree very much, Peter.

328
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,835
Are encouraged to not.

329
00:34:51,397 --> 00:35:02,141
And while I appreciate encouraged to refrain, I also like where we made suggestions about shifting things from shall to will or shall to must.

330
00:35:06,378 --> 00:35:21,090
You know, and I think what I think what like the the tenor of the South Hadley case was was a almost an egregious overreach by school leaders.

331
00:35:22,111 --> 00:35:26,174
And it's it's making sure that there's a reasonableness to it.

332
00:35:26,214 --> 00:35:29,857
It's much like you can't yell fire in a movie theater.

333
00:35:30,318 --> 00:35:30,838
You can't.

334
00:35:31,659 --> 00:35:34,521
Your freedom of speech is limited and bounded by certain things.

335
00:35:34,581 --> 00:35:35,062
And there are

336
00:35:35,602 --> 00:35:44,984
There are, you know, the constitution doesn't stop at the schoolhouse door, but there are limits as we are developing members of our society.

337
00:35:47,425 --> 00:35:52,386
I mean, the right to have an education is also a right.

338
00:35:52,666 --> 00:35:58,547
And so that's sort of how I view that whole disruption, you know, the freedom of speech.

339
00:35:59,861 --> 00:36:05,843
impinging on students' right to an education is where limiting happens.

340
00:36:07,564 --> 00:36:09,184
Member McLaughlin, your hand's up still.

341
00:36:09,204 --> 00:36:10,405
I don't know if you wanted to talk again.

342
00:36:12,165 --> 00:36:12,746
Actually, I don't.

343
00:36:12,786 --> 00:36:14,406
I was just sleeping and messing.

344
00:36:14,786 --> 00:36:16,787
Oops, and I got an echo.

345
00:36:17,307 --> 00:36:17,647
Thank you.

346
00:36:18,307 --> 00:36:19,148
All right.

347
00:36:19,208 --> 00:36:19,588
Can you hear me?

348
00:36:20,473 --> 00:36:20,673
Yes.

349
00:36:21,193 --> 00:36:25,094
I said, I actually don't, I'm leaving a message, but I have to step, not step away.

350
00:36:25,114 --> 00:36:28,375
I'm gonna have my earpiece in and I have to step downstairs to attend to something.

351
00:36:28,415 --> 00:36:32,277
I'll be listening, but I will be off screen for about five minutes.

352
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:33,557
Okay, thank you.

353
00:36:36,378 --> 00:36:43,620
So, I mean, what does that send?

354
00:36:44,761 --> 00:36:47,762
The word disruptive is particularly something I don't want to be,

355
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:58,852
That word has sadly been misused and essentially as a way of making sure girls bodies are not visible.

356
00:36:59,652 --> 00:37:05,597
And frankly, I think that the majority of complaints and problems we have are around.

357
00:37:06,632 --> 00:37:11,653
the word disruptive, and it frankly just means that at this point.

358
00:37:12,853 --> 00:37:27,136
We may be having a rather academic conversation right now where we think disruptive means something else, but I've got a barrage of emails from students on the new policy and disruptive doesn't mean anything to anybody but that.

359
00:37:28,156 --> 00:37:31,377
So does this sentence look okay?

360
00:37:31,397 --> 00:37:31,937
Excuse me.

361
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:39,792
So if I might add, just, is it okay?

362
00:37:40,752 --> 00:37:49,916
No, if I might add, just getting back to Mr. Began's point, I think, again, the synonym, which is what I was saying earlier, is fine.

363
00:37:50,056 --> 00:37:57,319
And I think it's just gonna be a matter of not just how a teacher interpreted initially, I think it'll be a matter of how the teacher or admin interprets it.

364
00:37:57,339 --> 00:37:59,920
But if it's raised to a level that we need to address, then we will.

365
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:06,122
And again, whether it's another issue in terms of a lawsuit or something like that, then obviously we address it.

366
00:38:06,162 --> 00:38:14,385
But I think that, yeah, using a word that's just a synonym but a little bit more vague than profanity would sort of address this.

367
00:38:16,886 --> 00:38:23,788
Yeah, I think, so for me, putting it in as they may not wear these things, I mean,

368
00:38:29,367 --> 00:38:31,809
I don't know, I mean, the Supreme Judicial Court said, yes, they may.

369
00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:43,216
So I feel very uncomfortable saying that they cannot come to school with the word dick emblazoned on it, because they can.

370
00:38:46,698 --> 00:38:49,080
I don't wanna encourage it, but the students can.

371
00:38:50,701 --> 00:38:56,805
Remember, so I just added to the chat, maybe a suggestion that could work.

372
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:00,231
Yeah, I like that.

373
00:39:00,251 --> 00:39:03,693
I like that better than this.

374
00:39:13,921 --> 00:39:16,743
I think that's a really good compromise.

375
00:39:17,624 --> 00:39:18,544
Nice wordsmithing.

376
00:39:19,105 --> 00:39:21,206
Yeah, I think it's really good.

377
00:39:21,246 --> 00:39:21,887
Thank you, Jenny.

378
00:39:23,848 --> 00:39:24,229
Welcome.

379
00:39:24,809 --> 00:39:25,570
Yeah, and I think

380
00:39:27,583 --> 00:39:33,691
Some of the things I was trying to navigate around was this sort of like arbitrary use of the word disruptive.

381
00:39:36,053 --> 00:39:41,861
And there's somewhat no way around that but address, you know, sort of addressing that.

382
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:46,782
the line of demarcation is a disruption to the learning environment.

383
00:39:46,822 --> 00:39:59,287
It's not just that you roll into school with FCK on your shirt and that at that point on a case-by-case basis, school leaders will deal with the disruptions on a case-by-case basis.

384
00:39:59,467 --> 00:40:02,929
I think that in my mind sufficiently addresses Ms.

385
00:40:02,969 --> 00:40:04,589
Galussi's concerns about

386
00:40:07,208 --> 00:40:13,311
disruptions being quite different at the elementary level, like FCK is gonna be disrupted at the elementary level.

387
00:40:14,292 --> 00:40:26,738
So I think that provides, you know, some guardrails without being like flagrantly in opposition with what the case law has provided.

388
00:40:28,502 --> 00:40:28,782
Thank you.

389
00:40:28,822 --> 00:40:33,706
I'm going to actually read that sentence out loud just because I'm not sure Member McLaughlin actually has her eyes on the screen right now.

390
00:40:35,247 --> 00:40:41,312
The new suggested sentence is, clothing that displays profanity or other vulgarities can disrupt the learning environment.

391
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:45,956
School leaders are reserved the right to address disruptions on a case-by-case basis.

392
00:40:48,378 --> 00:40:54,182
If there's no objection from members, we will add that.

393
00:40:55,904 --> 00:40:56,965
Let me go back to the

394
00:40:59,561 --> 00:41:00,762
We managed to get through that one.

395
00:41:01,222 --> 00:41:03,223
It's the one I knew was going to eat up a lot of time.

396
00:41:04,863 --> 00:41:20,529
So I think that this one from Assistant Superintendent Galluzzi, I, what do we have up here?

397
00:41:20,589 --> 00:41:29,053
Students must wear, yeah, I mean, I guess,

398
00:41:32,191 --> 00:41:37,255
Bathing suits, I mean, frankly, my son does go to school in a bathing suit.

399
00:41:38,015 --> 00:41:39,156
It's his favorite kind of shorts.

400
00:41:42,238 --> 00:41:53,607
And undergarments, most T-shirts and tank tops are undergarments for people of my age group, at least.

401
00:41:55,508 --> 00:41:57,930
And I certainly understand the point.

402
00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:00,632
You don't want somebody just showing up with a frilly pair of underwear

403
00:42:02,479 --> 00:42:09,983
and, you know, or showing up in a bikini to school.

404
00:42:12,424 --> 00:42:18,747
On the other hand, which I mean, would be incredibly uncomfortable at the high school.

405
00:42:19,248 --> 00:42:20,808
It could be freezing or hot, you won't know.

406
00:42:22,209 --> 00:42:27,612
But I'm just not sure how to include this

407
00:42:34,027 --> 00:42:42,876
Again, I know they're drastically different, right, in my world versus the secondary world.

408
00:42:43,737 --> 00:42:53,026
Although I'm open to member Graham's wordsmithing again here, because I just feel like

409
00:42:54,501 --> 00:43:21,027
capturing something that just states that students, you tried covering it a little bit above about how certain private areas have to be covered, but I'm just concerned a little bit that if there's just not a little bit more specificity to the language that you also in turn are gonna get some students to probably purposely push the envelope just a little bit.

410
00:43:22,648 --> 00:43:25,269
Yeah, I do want to acknowledge that you are absolutely right.

411
00:43:25,289 --> 00:43:32,593
There are going to be students who are going to push the envelope very soon after this becomes policy, if it does pass.

412
00:43:32,633 --> 00:43:34,054
So I don't want to ignore that.

413
00:43:35,895 --> 00:43:38,936
I see Mr. Blanca.

414
00:43:40,797 --> 00:43:44,199
Yeah, this is interesting, because you mentioned that, but I read.

415
00:43:44,279 --> 00:43:50,062
But also, we do have swim classes here at the high school and physical education time.

416
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:57,805
someone might want to deem wearing their bathing suit, you know, to save time on on changing and all of that stuff.

417
00:43:59,106 --> 00:44:05,391
So I just want to put the high school perspective of why someone might be wearing a bathing suit to school.

418
00:44:07,273 --> 00:44:11,016
I've seen it happen before, but it's not a frequent

419
00:44:12,268 --> 00:44:22,939
kind of thing, but I have seen mostly male students that know that they have swim class due to physical education, they have wore bathing suits.

420
00:44:22,979 --> 00:44:35,471
So I think like you said, it needs to be sort of a member Graham wordsmithing that could help alleviate some of this ideas of what's what.

421
00:44:41,143 --> 00:44:51,692
If I can just piggyback too, I mean, generally speaking, in physical education class, it's considered methods of good hygiene to change out of whatever your workout gear is.

422
00:44:52,653 --> 00:45:08,326
Therefore, based on like the physical education standards, it would not be a good practice to be wearing your bathing suits as clothing, especially if you've just been participating in a swim class or going to participate in a swim class.

423
00:45:09,147 --> 00:45:24,184
Um, so I mean, under what, what the physical education standards are, usually it's, you know, students come and they change, uh, and, you know, we'll then change out of the workout clothes because then you're not going back to class, uh, sweaty and, um, you know,

424
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:28,031
potentially causing issues for those around you.

425
00:45:28,712 --> 00:45:40,719
So, I mean, once again, I also worry about this now invites those students who want to push various areas of the dress code when

426
00:45:41,957 --> 00:46:04,564
trying to realize like okay how are we growing as an organization to understand where students are and where families are while also maintaining a sense of professionalism and instilling professionalism in our students especially as they matriculate from high school and enter the collegiate or workforce or

427
00:46:05,424 --> 00:46:12,230
for the trade schooling or whatever else they may be, but there'll be certain standards that we want to have prepared them for.

428
00:46:19,936 --> 00:46:27,802
Yes, the comment that I was just going to make about the covering of the bathing suits, and I know that

429
00:46:30,983 --> 00:46:34,292
a few bullets up where we're pretty explicit in terms of

430
00:46:36,696 --> 00:46:40,117
not wanting people exposing private parts, showing their body.

431
00:46:40,177 --> 00:46:53,541
If you're thinking about a bathing suit for a female student, if she was choosing to wear a two-piece swimsuit, we do clearly state that they should have a top, a bottom, and footwear.

432
00:46:53,581 --> 00:46:57,683
So they shouldn't be walking barefoot in the schools or outside.

433
00:46:57,763 --> 00:47:00,763
They should have some type of footwear on.

434
00:47:00,884 --> 00:47:03,104
They need to have a top and they need to have a bottom.

435
00:47:03,484 --> 00:47:04,505
And I know that there are,

436
00:47:06,072 --> 00:47:20,969
Some swim trunks that are really long, like they look like skateboard pants or whatever so some students may actually wear that as part of their fashion, but I think just being clear that we don't want to encourage.

437
00:47:23,329 --> 00:47:32,136
swimsuits, people saying now, you know, it's warm, swimsuits, you know, this is my top, my bottom for the day.

438
00:47:32,237 --> 00:47:47,790
So I think if we're saying to them, you need to wear a top, you need to have a bottom and you need to have footwear, that being explicit about that, so people just understand, I don't know if it's,

439
00:47:50,019 --> 00:47:58,249
So, whether someone is having a swim class as part of their PE or their particular rotation, they understand that they are.

440
00:48:00,728 --> 00:48:21,551
You know, to have their swimsuit covered in that regard, or if it's someone wearing the swim trunks and they go swimming and they don't plan on changing their clothing, we wouldn't want someone walking through the hallways with wet clothing on for several hours it's just people can get sick and it's not something that you would be encouraging.

441
00:48:23,829 --> 00:48:29,773
Again, I think it's okay to say cover bathing suits and undergarments.

442
00:48:30,233 --> 00:48:34,515
I'm thinking, again, at the secondary level, we know we have the pool here.

443
00:48:35,416 --> 00:48:43,941
And if for whatever reason students were to be wearing it at the lower grade levels, that they should have a top

444
00:48:45,052 --> 00:48:50,054
a bottom and footwear, and that we're not talking about bathing suits.

445
00:48:50,634 --> 00:48:56,537
It's kind of like that gray area, but I think saying that that's not what we wanna see.

446
00:48:56,697 --> 00:49:10,383
And again, it's up to the administrator or teacher to have a conversation with the child or with the parent to say, this is what we're hoping to see the child wear to school.

447
00:49:14,983 --> 00:49:41,301
I see nothing wrong with saying that, understanding that you said, well, my son does wear swim shorts to school, but if he's wearing them more as a fashionable statement and it isn't causing any kinds of disruption, that's, I think it's, in that regards, we're not gonna be the swim shorts police, but again,

448
00:49:43,217 --> 00:49:52,224
I think trying to be explicitly clear, sometimes you end up opening the door to challenge, no matter what way you look at it.

449
00:49:52,244 --> 00:49:55,987
I was actually

450
00:50:00,948 --> 00:50:11,830
wondering, and I don't know if this is like a fully formed idea, but I mean, what we're dancing around is the difference between boys bathing suits and girls bathing suits, right?

451
00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:22,832
Like no one cares that Paul's son wears his swim trunks to school, but what we're really saying is what we're worried about is girls wearing bathing suits to school.

452
00:50:23,593 --> 00:50:24,873
And I think

453
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:51,699
As I was thinking through this, I went back to read and one thing we could do is say, in the bullet that says that students may not wear clothing that intentionally show private parts, clothing must cover private parts in opaque material, maybe it's intentionally show private parts or undergarments.

454
00:50:54,179 --> 00:51:05,321
And the reason I hesitate to say that is because I don't wanna hear stories about people being sent home or dress coded because their bra straps are showing.

455
00:51:05,381 --> 00:51:06,981
That's not what we're talking about.

456
00:51:07,441 --> 00:51:15,003
So I like really hesitate to like even say this, but I think what we're trying to say is we don't wanna see your underwear.

457
00:51:15,783 --> 00:51:19,843
I feel like that's reasonable and we need to find a way to work that in.

458
00:51:20,663 --> 00:51:23,084
And I think bathing suit can sort of

459
00:51:24,321 --> 00:51:29,706
be swept in if we can adopt some language about not wanting to see people's underwear.

460
00:51:31,387 --> 00:51:31,768
Thank you.

461
00:51:32,368 --> 00:51:36,492
I think your point, though, that we're really just talking about girls.

462
00:51:38,654 --> 00:51:39,795
I don't want to see boy underwear either.

463
00:51:40,295 --> 00:51:40,715
to be clear.

464
00:51:40,835 --> 00:51:42,496
No, but about bathing suits.

465
00:51:43,176 --> 00:51:43,336
Right.

466
00:51:43,396 --> 00:51:43,556
Yeah.

467
00:51:43,616 --> 00:51:53,839
If every boy tomorrow comes to school in swim trunks, there will be zero dress code, even with the current policy, not one boy will be receiving a dress code violation.

468
00:51:54,419 --> 00:52:00,901
And if girls wear those same swim trunks, they also will not receive it.

469
00:52:01,381 --> 00:52:04,282
So what we're really talking about here is how much of a

470
00:52:05,591 --> 00:52:09,113
the female body, are we okay having visible in class?

471
00:52:09,233 --> 00:52:10,273
That's what we're talking about.

472
00:52:11,354 --> 00:52:23,899
And that, if I go back up to here, the core values, girls are not responsible for the reactions of the rest of their classmates and their teachers to their bodies.

473
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:26,741
That's our core value.

474
00:52:27,161 --> 00:52:27,761
And so I,

475
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:32,763
I'm getting less and less comfortable around this idea.

476
00:52:32,783 --> 00:52:39,709
I don't envision many girls having an interest in going to school in a two-piece bikini.

477
00:52:40,669 --> 00:52:46,895
And if they do, it's for a reason such as attention and certainly not comfort.

478
00:52:48,316 --> 00:52:51,579
But, you know,

479
00:52:52,840 --> 00:53:02,384
Hey, I'd be okay with getting, saying no bathing suits, but I also want somebody at the door checking the backs of every one of the boys when they come in to see, is this a bathing suit or is this shorts?

480
00:53:03,945 --> 00:53:06,766
And we're not gonna do that for many different reasons.

481
00:53:07,826 --> 00:53:08,026
So.

482
00:53:08,046 --> 00:53:08,546
Yeah.

483
00:53:09,427 --> 00:53:17,650
That's why I was wondering if talking about intentionally showing undergarments sufficiently like,

484
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:24,195
covers us without having to dabble in this arbitration about bathing suits.

485
00:53:27,077 --> 00:53:27,778
I don't know who was next.

486
00:53:27,838 --> 00:53:29,259
Suzanne, were you next?

487
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:30,861
Go ahead.

488
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:32,142
I will be brief.

489
00:53:32,262 --> 00:53:33,683
I just wanted to say one thing.

490
00:53:35,505 --> 00:53:37,586
Full disclosure, I was

491
00:53:39,401 --> 00:53:43,803
not aware necessarily that this entire document was going to be shared with the edits.

492
00:53:43,823 --> 00:53:45,003
So when I put- I'm sorry.

493
00:53:45,464 --> 00:53:45,924
That's okay.

494
00:53:45,964 --> 00:53:49,886
But when I put in here suggestion to cover, I meant discuss.

495
00:53:50,806 --> 00:53:59,149
That's for one, because this document was at first internal and I was having discussions with my school leaders as well as the central team.

496
00:53:59,790 --> 00:54:07,033
So I don't want people thinking that that's in there saying to cover up just because the semantics of that have been going

497
00:54:08,289 --> 00:54:09,189
I've been listening to it.

498
00:54:10,350 --> 00:54:19,975
I do like in where the superintendent was headed in this discussion, because I do think it is covered a little bit above.

499
00:54:20,055 --> 00:54:27,039
And I think if we put a similar disclaimer that member Graham was talking about, that would probably cover it in my eyes.

500
00:54:27,059 --> 00:54:30,861
And when I wrote this, it had,

501
00:54:32,126 --> 00:54:53,579
Again, I will state that I am the proud mother of two daughters, so this did not have anything to do with the difference between what girls are wearing and what boys may be wearing to school or what any student is wearing to school, as more as it is that some students would come in their underwear and rather than having

502
00:54:55,208 --> 00:55:06,032
I just feel like there are areas in which I wanted to have a discussion around it, not necessarily the exact language, if that's clear.

503
00:55:08,493 --> 00:55:16,916
I do apologize for sharing it without actually even asking you, because I understood this as just being a jumping off a conversation point.

504
00:55:17,236 --> 00:55:17,696
Thank you.

505
00:55:18,256 --> 00:55:18,637
Mr. Began.

506
00:55:18,657 --> 00:55:18,937
Yeah.

507
00:55:23,450 --> 00:55:32,317
This issue, I think what Suzanne is trying to do, I think rightly so, is cover a potential loophole here.

508
00:55:33,418 --> 00:55:41,425
And you could have a girl show up in a bikini, but it's not just girls.

509
00:55:41,505 --> 00:55:44,888
You could have a boy show up in a Speedo bathing suit.

510
00:55:45,909 --> 00:55:51,393
And people might be going even more insane if that happened than a girl in a bikini.

511
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:55,062
It's not just a boy or girl thing.

512
00:55:55,342 --> 00:56:05,712
I think it's just covering, excuse the pun, covering your backside so that people don't show up in bathing suits trying to push the envelope.

513
00:56:06,193 --> 00:56:14,922
And I think you could just add in that up where you have students must wear, maybe you have a disclaimer that, you know,

514
00:56:15,729 --> 00:56:25,817
bikini briefs, boy or girl, are not considered a bottom and a bikini top is not considered a top.

515
00:56:25,877 --> 00:56:27,278
I think that's what we're talking about.

516
00:56:31,982 --> 00:56:35,845
Just to avoid the day when they walk through the door, I mean, that's all you try.

517
00:56:35,945 --> 00:56:38,007
And I agree with you, not many people would do it.

518
00:56:38,477 --> 00:56:41,721
There might be one or two kids brave enough in the whole school system to do that.

519
00:56:42,402 --> 00:56:43,063
God bless them.

520
00:56:43,483 --> 00:56:47,748
But I certainly didn't have that confidence in high school.

521
00:56:48,229 --> 00:56:53,255
So in any event, but I think that's what you're trying to protect against.

522
00:56:54,609 --> 00:56:55,490
Yeah, thank you.

523
00:56:56,210 --> 00:56:56,870
I certainly agree.

524
00:56:57,531 --> 00:57:10,658
I also just, I'm just remembering an email I received from a student who pointed out that our current dress code policy seems to be perfectly fine with our cheerleaders wearing things that are not considered acceptable.

525
00:57:12,239 --> 00:57:23,505
And I thought that was a very interesting thing to note that we, even with our policy that has been traditionally rather restrictive and conservative,

526
00:57:24,042 --> 00:57:34,264
We not bad at an eyelash that in school sponsored during the school day events, we allowed the girls who are on the cheerleading team to wear clothes that they could not go to class in.

527
00:57:35,344 --> 00:57:44,226
So I just think that's, it's really not possible to ignore the fact that this is a gendered conversation.

528
00:57:44,246 --> 00:57:44,886
It is.

529
00:57:48,227 --> 00:57:48,287
And

530
00:57:54,538 --> 00:57:56,199
I lost my train of thought.

531
00:57:58,280 --> 00:57:59,340
Jane, did you wanna speak?

532
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:01,641
I know your hand went up three or four times and then came back down.

533
00:58:03,722 --> 00:58:05,823
Hi, I just, I didn't know actually.

534
00:58:05,843 --> 00:58:08,624
If you could just name and address for the record.

535
00:58:08,664 --> 00:58:11,965
Yes, I am Jane Hamill, 16 Maynard Street.

536
00:58:12,985 --> 00:58:17,107
I realized after the fact that I wasn't sure if I was supposed to speak or allowed to speak.

537
00:58:19,408 --> 00:58:21,489
So I just wanted to just throw in the,

538
00:58:22,755 --> 00:58:25,377
I just really appreciate everyone's thoughtfulness.

539
00:58:26,038 --> 00:58:41,651
I did appreciate the kind of the covering of, you know, the wearing a top, a bottom and footwear and the way that those are already kind of defined, just wearing just a bra top or just a bikini top, like already is covered in there, right?

540
00:58:41,691 --> 00:58:45,694
It's already in there that that's, that is not in fact a shirt or a top.

541
00:58:48,697 --> 00:58:49,878
And then I just wanted to,

542
00:58:51,587 --> 00:59:05,052
just as a parent of high schoolers and all that, just reiterate the importance of finding a way to not have any language that says no undergarments should be showing and that's with the bra strap issue.

543
00:59:05,072 --> 00:59:12,655
It just, I know that kids are getting dress coded for that right now, like this school year in a couple of the schools.

544
00:59:12,875 --> 00:59:16,617
And I just think that there's so many styles and so many,

545
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:20,761
so many moments where that is not really necessary.

546
00:59:20,821 --> 00:59:28,033
And so I'm really hopeful that the committee will have a way to have language that just does not allow for that to occur.

547
00:59:29,455 --> 00:59:29,796
Thank you.

548
00:59:31,919 --> 00:59:32,360
Thank you.

549
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:32,801
Member Graham.

550
00:59:34,945 --> 00:59:36,806
Yeah, I was.

551
00:59:37,787 --> 00:59:38,687
Jane, I'm with you.

552
00:59:38,707 --> 00:59:43,790
I do think that is a challenge.

553
00:59:43,870 --> 00:59:51,814
So I wonder if back to the bullet about and, you know, intentionally showing private parts, that that is not allowable.

554
00:59:54,476 --> 00:59:58,378
Maybe it's like a substantial

555
01:00:02,302 --> 01:00:05,203
like fraction of undergarments or something like that.

556
01:00:05,223 --> 01:00:17,928
Like I wanna clearly make sure we're not dress coding girls based on their bra straps, but I generally don't wanna see people's undergarments in life.

557
01:00:18,248 --> 01:00:28,693
So I think thinking about a notion that the majority of somebody's undergarments are covered, the vast majority seems reasonable.

558
01:00:30,663 --> 01:00:52,694
So I don't know if there's a way for us to say, intentionally show private parts or substantial portions of undergarments, or maybe we just say, or undergarments, and we say, you know, this does not include bra straps.

559
01:00:53,214 --> 01:00:53,494
I don't know.

560
01:00:53,574 --> 01:00:57,716
Maybe we just like really name it so that there can be no confusion.

561
01:01:04,841 --> 01:01:22,509
I personally like calling out explicitly that, I mean, honestly, I'm still blown away that bra straps are considered anything other than just that they're, I don't know, I can't fathom how that's even an issue in anybody's mind.

562
01:01:22,529 --> 01:01:24,710
But does this sound okay?

563
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:36,762
you know, like any policy, we can revisit if it doesn't, things don't roll well in the next year or two, we can come back and revisit.

564
01:01:37,862 --> 01:01:40,622
I did talk, I'm actually adding it to the wrong document.

565
01:01:48,804 --> 01:01:55,925
I think that sounds reasonable as an addition to qualify this discussion.

566
01:01:58,146 --> 01:01:58,446
I think

567
01:01:59,979 --> 01:02:01,301
May I remember, Marissa?

568
01:02:01,341 --> 01:02:01,681
Yes, yes.

569
01:02:02,942 --> 01:02:06,747
I think, I mean, I think I understand the intention.

570
01:02:07,498 --> 01:02:19,006
And I also think that when you start parsing out what undergarments means, there's going to be all this like, well, what about the front of my bra strap?

571
01:02:19,026 --> 01:02:21,548
Or what about the top of my underwear?

572
01:02:21,588 --> 01:02:28,753
I mean, I think it gets really going into the minutiae when we start to parse out what this means.

573
01:02:29,394 --> 01:02:31,775
And so I don't know.

574
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:33,536
Undergarments too, I think, is so vague.

575
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:36,041
I guess you could just say underwear.

576
01:02:36,061 --> 01:02:37,041
I don't know.

577
01:02:37,061 --> 01:02:39,422
I think undergarments can be any number of things.

578
01:02:39,462 --> 01:02:56,368
I think a lot of the girls, certainly I have a young adult female in my home and they essentially wear what looks to me like a bra under a shirt maybe or a cardigan or something like that with the cardigan open.

579
01:02:58,061 --> 01:03:00,862
And, you know, does that qualify as an undergarment?

580
01:03:00,902 --> 01:03:02,103
Does that qualify as underwear?

581
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:03,423
Does that qualify as bra straps?

582
01:03:03,543 --> 01:03:03,843
I don't know.

583
01:03:03,864 --> 01:03:08,425
I think you're gonna like, we're really sort of getting into the weeds with some of that minutia.

584
01:03:08,465 --> 01:03:10,086
So I don't know.

585
01:03:10,106 --> 01:03:16,048
I would be curious to hear what our folks who are in the high school every day seeing this have to say.

586
01:03:16,148 --> 01:03:21,390
So maybe Maurice or Mr. DeLava, if you could weigh in here, it would be good to hear from you.

587
01:03:22,756 --> 01:03:25,243
I feel comfortable with the term undergarments.

588
01:03:28,252 --> 01:03:39,358
whether it's bra tops or thong underwears or boxer shorts or kids wearing their pants halfway down their.

589
01:03:41,839 --> 01:03:44,380
It's all undergarments and we really don't need to see it.

590
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:45,401
It's not necessary.

591
01:03:45,901 --> 01:03:52,244
So again, going back to the top, a shirt, a blouse, a sweater, a sweatshirt, a tank, et cetera.

592
01:03:53,245 --> 01:03:55,926
We say top, we say bottom, we say footwear.

593
01:03:57,927 --> 01:04:02,031
So are you okay with the bra strap is what I'm asking.

594
01:04:02,071 --> 01:04:09,396
Yes, I'm comfortable with a bra strap because some tops have very thin straps.

595
01:04:09,917 --> 01:04:11,979
And so the bra strap will show.

596
01:04:12,639 --> 01:04:22,507
But again, I know that there have been situations where students weren't just exposing the bra strap, but other parts.

597
01:04:23,708 --> 01:04:25,970
And it's just, I think it's,

598
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:34,022
If we can focus on, you know, tops bottoms and and footwear and say this is what our expectation is.

599
01:04:34,042 --> 01:04:37,426
And if you know you have one or two outliers.

600
01:04:37,966 --> 01:04:43,612
I know that the teachers and or administration will speak to those students, but if it's something where

601
01:04:45,445 --> 01:04:46,466
it becomes egregious.

602
01:04:47,207 --> 01:04:51,972
And, you know, people want to say, you know what, this is my top.

603
01:04:52,453 --> 01:05:00,562
My top is, you know, a bra, or my top is, you know, something that really, you don't need to wear that to school.

604
01:05:00,682 --> 01:05:03,585
I think by saying undergarments where, you know,

605
01:05:04,846 --> 01:05:22,097
We're covering all of it, whether it's it's or for male, because, again, they both have different clothing styles, and we do see undergarments of male students as well, quite often and they're told, you know, fix your clothing.

606
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:39,246
I think by saying undergarments, if people, and again, we've qualified it about saying with the exception of the bra straps, that that's pretty clear in terms of what it is that we're talking about.

607
01:05:40,867 --> 01:05:50,351
And again, I see that as being more of a secondary concern, but I think we have more, you know,

608
01:05:51,682 --> 01:05:56,826
At the elementary levels, I don't see as much of these types of issues surfacing.

609
01:05:57,867 --> 01:06:08,454
It would be more at the secondary level where you would have students really wanting to see what they could get away with in terms of clothing.

610
01:06:09,215 --> 01:06:16,640
So I feel like this is a happy medium and then removing the other piece about the bathing suit, et cetera.

611
01:06:16,660 --> 01:06:17,781
I think that this covers it.

612
01:06:21,868 --> 01:06:36,782
And, yeah, let's reiterate I agree with the superintendent I think the undergarments tends to cover it on a personal level as an administrator likes the school see I also have a senior daughter as well.

613
01:06:38,183 --> 01:06:38,884
I personally.

614
01:06:40,644 --> 01:06:48,546
do not get involved with female garments in the school because it leads to another problem.

615
01:06:49,286 --> 01:07:01,710
So for example, if I saw a bra strap, I'm not going to confront a girl and say your bra strap is showing because it could lead to potential other things of a male addressing a female student.

616
01:07:02,610 --> 01:07:03,491
uh, regarding that.

617
01:07:03,571 --> 01:07:23,761
So I think with the term undergarments, and again, this is what I mean by protocol, you know, as we, as a team discuss, you know, things like, okay, if bra straps, like that's not going to fit in this part of the policy, but this will fit in this part of the policy so that the school leaders know what to address.

618
01:07:23,962 --> 01:07:32,146
Because I think if it becomes ambiguous to, um, it's left up to interpretation and that doesn't always come out as the best outcome either.

619
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:37,240
Number or so.

620
01:07:38,121 --> 01:07:38,341
Yes.

621
01:07:39,401 --> 01:07:39,642
Yeah.

622
01:07:40,382 --> 01:07:40,542
Yeah.

623
01:07:40,582 --> 01:07:40,762
Yeah.

624
01:07:40,802 --> 01:07:41,062
Sorry.

625
01:07:41,903 --> 01:07:42,083
Yeah.

626
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:46,605
So I was just going to add, you know, I'm assuming Mr. DeLava, but I guess I don't want to assume.

627
01:07:46,645 --> 01:07:57,110
And for the folks who are on the call, I want to make sure that we're clarifying anyway, or folks watching that dealing with dress code, potential dress code violations or anything sort of that manner that

628
01:07:57,527 --> 01:08:06,373
You guys obviously think about it from a team approach so that a male teacher can address males, preferably a female teacher can address females, preferably.

629
01:08:06,393 --> 01:08:09,975
I'm assuming that that would be the norm anyway, is that right?

630
01:08:10,375 --> 01:08:11,176
Yeah, that would be it.

631
01:08:11,236 --> 01:08:20,181
So for example, if I saw something that deemed inappropriate on the female side, I'm going to contact my female AP.

632
01:08:21,462 --> 01:08:25,664
because I think that's just a better conversation to have.

633
01:08:26,244 --> 01:08:34,989
If I see a male student, as Dr. Edward Vincent stated, that, hey, you're showing your arm again, that's an easy conversation for me to pull the student aside and say,

634
01:08:36,046 --> 01:08:41,809
hey, we wanna just kind of fix ourselves and move on with our day.

635
01:08:43,250 --> 01:08:55,017
So yeah, we do here at the high school, we use it as a team approach just because there could be other, like I said, there could be other ramifications that go on with the gender.

636
01:08:55,037 --> 01:09:03,402
And it stinks that that's, like was said, this is more on a female level, unfortunately, which,

637
01:09:06,485 --> 01:09:08,487
we're always talking about equity and how that should be.

638
01:09:08,587 --> 01:09:13,410
So yeah, we try to just address it as best we can.

639
01:09:13,470 --> 01:09:22,936
And I, again, I don't ever want it to be like in the hallway, you know, this is showing, you know, that should be a conversation that's pulled aside.

640
01:09:25,577 --> 01:09:25,998
Thank you.

641
01:09:26,258 --> 01:09:28,639
Member Graves, did you want to speak?

642
01:09:28,659 --> 01:09:30,681
Yeah.

643
01:09:34,537 --> 01:09:47,337
I feel like we went down a really strange rabbit hole right there that I have take a lot of exception to when I think of a team approach, I don't think that that ever means like promoting and perpetuating.

644
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:49,391
sexism.

645
01:09:49,811 --> 01:10:06,378
And that's what I hear in that statement, although well intended so I would encourage the administration to revisit the input, how they approach dress code as they implement this policy because I think the point of this policy was to take all of the

646
01:10:08,688 --> 01:10:13,511
implicit sexism out of the mix and off the table.

647
01:10:14,132 --> 01:10:28,363
And if the administration continues to deal with dress code matters in a way that's counter to that, then we're doing our students a disservice as we talk about equity.

648
01:10:28,423 --> 01:10:34,087
So that neither here nor there, I did wanna do a time check, it is 10 past five.

649
01:10:36,765 --> 01:10:45,613
Yes, so our- I also just want to, may I remember, so just as a point of information or as a response to that, I just want to clarify, that's not what I heard.

650
01:10:46,133 --> 01:10:52,779
So I think that that's part of this, is that so much of this can be subjective, and that's why we're trying to be so nuanced in so much of it.

651
01:10:53,099 --> 01:11:03,328
So what I heard, or certainly what I intended when I was raising that and what I heard Principal DeLava respond to me as too, was that we're being sensitive to the needs of,

652
01:11:04,028 --> 01:11:09,973
are individual students based on how we are presenting to them concern.

653
01:11:12,514 --> 01:11:20,981
There's not a male approaching potentially a female and and further embarrassing them based because of all of the gender sort of

654
01:11:22,044 --> 01:11:24,285
issues or norms or what have you that exist there.

655
01:11:24,365 --> 01:11:27,965
Not that we're targeting girls more or targeting boys more or anything like that.

656
01:11:28,025 --> 01:11:33,607
My point was that we're actually being more subtle and more thoughtful about how it's being approached.

657
01:11:33,647 --> 01:11:40,248
And that I know that certainly my child or other children I would assume would prefer to be approached by potentially.

658
01:11:40,288 --> 01:11:43,889
And again, this is such a gendered conversation that it's really hard to have the conversation.

659
01:11:43,909 --> 01:11:48,010
So there's even more nuance there, but that it's about being sensitive to the needs of

660
01:11:48,690 --> 01:11:57,414
people across gender that you might not understand that perhaps as women, we may understand some women's issues better.

661
01:11:57,634 --> 01:12:00,996
And as men, men may understand men's better issues better.

662
01:12:01,036 --> 01:12:08,699
And again, that's the caveat of trying not to be so gendered, but more about being sensitive to other people.

663
01:12:08,739 --> 01:12:11,920
So that was what I heard in the administration administration's response.

664
01:12:12,701 --> 01:12:13,041
Thanks.

665
01:12:13,821 --> 01:12:14,301
Thank you.

666
01:12:15,102 --> 01:12:15,302
So

667
01:12:16,668 --> 01:12:20,591
I believe those were all of the parts of the policy that we needed to review.

668
01:12:21,191 --> 01:12:30,337
And is there any last comments before I ask if there's a motion to report this out favorably, hopefully?

669
01:12:33,859 --> 01:12:34,520
No.

670
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:38,802
Would anybody like to make a motion to report out the language as is?

671
01:12:41,024 --> 01:12:42,785
Motion to report the language out as is.

672
01:12:43,940 --> 01:12:44,941
to the school sergeant may.

673
01:12:46,061 --> 01:12:47,042
Thank you.

674
01:12:52,165 --> 01:12:52,726
Member Graham?

675
01:12:53,946 --> 01:12:54,206
Yes.

676
01:12:55,427 --> 01:12:56,228
Member McLaughlin?

677
01:12:58,669 --> 01:12:58,989
Yes.

678
01:13:00,130 --> 01:13:02,031
Member Rousseau, yes.

679
01:13:02,872 --> 01:13:05,113
Three in the affirmative.

680
01:13:05,414 --> 01:13:06,394
I want to thank everybody.

681
01:13:06,955 --> 01:13:08,656
This was a hard one.

682
01:13:09,856 --> 01:13:12,238
I think the outcome is

683
01:13:13,879 --> 01:13:14,640
Well, damn good.

684
01:13:16,581 --> 01:13:26,668
You know, it's a lot of society and history and ideals all coming together in one policy that makes it really, really challenging.

685
01:13:27,249 --> 01:13:30,211
And I just want to reiterate something I've said in other meetings.

686
01:13:31,532 --> 01:13:35,314
This is language we can change a week after we implement it.

687
01:13:35,475 --> 01:13:38,717
So if we've screwed stuff up, frankly,

688
01:13:39,224 --> 01:13:45,788
I shouldn't swear so much, but if we've messed things up so much in some way, we can revisit it.

689
01:13:46,068 --> 01:13:47,189
It's not set in stone.

690
01:13:47,349 --> 01:13:54,113
So I really appreciate all the open dialogue and effort to get us here.

691
01:13:54,253 --> 01:13:54,473
So.

692
01:13:56,375 --> 01:13:57,215
Thanks, everyone.

693
01:13:57,455 --> 01:13:57,896
Agreed.

694
01:13:58,216 --> 01:13:59,957
Motion to adjourn.

695
01:14:01,438 --> 01:14:02,018
Motion to adjourn.

696
01:14:02,038 --> 01:14:04,800
Second.

697
01:14:04,860 --> 01:14:05,320
Member Graham.

698
01:14:06,341 --> 01:14:06,601
Yes.

699
01:14:07,501 --> 01:14:08,202
Member McLaughlin.

700
01:14:09,145 --> 01:14:09,445
Yes.

701
01:14:10,326 --> 01:14:11,247
Number so, yes.

702
01:14:11,387 --> 01:14:13,008
And thank you to all the public that came.

703
01:14:13,028 --> 01:14:17,312
A lot of public came to this and I greatly appreciated that as well as the administration.

704
01:14:17,972 --> 01:14:18,653
Have a good night, everyone.
