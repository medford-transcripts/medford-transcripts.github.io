    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=4.492">Hey,</a>  Medford Bites listeners. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=5.913">Today's</a>  episode was created completely by the students in Mr. Cormier's fifth grade class from the Roberts Elementary School. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=12.619">As</a>  this end of the school year approaches, they wanted to explore their upcoming transition to middle school. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=17.903">They</a>  prepared all of their own questions for the principals and students of both middle schools, as well as some of their favorite memories from elementary school and advice for students in younger grades. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=27.05">I</a>  hope you enjoy. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=34.979">All</a>  right, thank you all so much for joining me today. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=37.441">I'm</a>  here with Mr. Cormier's class at the Roberts Elementary School. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=41.744">And</a>  we are going to be doing a little interview with some special guests today from the McGlynn Middle School. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=49.55">So</a>  if you on that end, could you just take a moment to introduce yourselves with your name and pronouns?</p>

    <p>[Nick Tucci]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=55.615">Hi,</a>  good morning, everybody. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=56.555">My</a>  name is Mr. Tucci, and I'm the principal of the John J. McGlynn Middle School. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=60.498">And</a>  my pronouns are he and him. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=62.798">Turning</a>  it over to sixth grade students here. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=65.002">Starting</a>  with Nell.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=67.406">Hi,</a>  I'm Nell Reese and my pronouns are she, her.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=72.113">Hi,</a>  I'm Luti Martino and my pronouns are he, him.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=75.91">All</a>  right, thank you all. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=76.831">So</a>  during every podcast, I always ask my guests what their favorite place to eat is in Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=82.415">And</a>  Mr. Cormier's class did vote on this. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=85.498">And</a>  their answers were number one, Bertucci's, number two, Avellino's, and number three was Domino's. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=91.502">So</a>  lots of pizza over here. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=94.385">Okay,</a>  so the fifth graders here prepared some questions to ask you all about the transition to middle school. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=100.87">So</a>  I'm gonna have them one at a time, ask their questions.</p>

    <p>[Brothers]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=106.765">Where's</a>  john Hi, my name is john de mayo and my pronouns are are he and him. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=118.892">What</a>  is the most challenging thing about the transition from elementary school and middle school.</p>

    <p>[Nick Tucci]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=127.609">I'm</a>  going to answer that question. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=128.789">Great</a>  question, by the way. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=129.47">I'm</a>  going to answer that question from the perspective of a principal. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=132.29">You</a>  know, one of the biggest challenges is from an academic standpoint, where you're not just going to have one primary teacher, like you might in elementary school, and you're now going to have a number of different teachers. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=141.513">In</a>  fact, you're going to be going to eight different periods throughout the course of a school day. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=145.114">And</a>  you're going to have to meet the challenges and demands that each teacher sets forth for them on a given day. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=152.036">So</a>  while that's a challenge, it's also an exciting part about the transition to middle school as well, being able to interact with different educators that are going to be involved in your day-to-day schedule. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=163.224">I'm</a>  going to turn it over to Nell and Luke to answer the questions from a student standpoint.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=168.783">Um,</a>  well, for me, the most challenging part was, uh, really like memorizing and getting my schedule down. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=175.504">And,</a>  uh, because I was used to just sitting with one teacher all day in my classroom. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=180.865">But</a>  then once I started getting a schedule where I had one teacher for like back-to-back classes, like a double block, and then, um, another like teacher for just one class, it was like, it kind of confused you at first, but then once you get your schedule down, it makes it a lot easier <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=197.332">and</a>  your days just fly by because they feel even quicker when you teach every period.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=203.917">For</a>  me, it was also probably the schedule. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=206.839">On</a>  the first day I got lost because you have to go to different floors for some classes. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=212.984">But</a>  after I got used to where all my classes were, like Luke said, the classes went by quickly because you got new teachers and points of views and stuff. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=225.021">is</a>  explained really well and they can also stay after school to help you if you get confused or anything.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=231.603">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=233.844">Davi.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=239.606">Hi,</a>  I'm Davi. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=241.247">My</a>  pronouns are he, him. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=243.687">And</a>  this can be answered by any one of you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=245.568">I</a>  just want to know, will I still see my friends in side A if I'm in side B?</p>

    <p>[Nick Tucci]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=253.897">David,</a>  thanks. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=254.617">Great</a>  question. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=255.858">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=256.518">You'll</a>  be able to see your friends if you're placed on one side or the other. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=260.12">There</a>  are many opportunities for that before school and even during school. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=265.082">You</a>  know, we all eat lunch in the cafeteria together. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=267.543">We</a>  all go outside to recess together. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=270.065">And</a>  certainly you'll be on your respective side, whether it be side A or side B for your core classes. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=277.208">meaning</a>  classes like math, English, social studies, and science. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=280.931">But</a>  when you go to your exploratory classes, you'll have the opportunity to be able to be a part of exploratory classes with people mixed up from both side A and side B. One last thing I'll note is that after-school activities are going to be something we're really going to encourage you to be a part of, join a club, a sport, an activity. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=299.867">Certainly,</a>  you'll have the opportunity to be able to interact with people on both sides in those clubs, sports, and activities. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=305.592">And</a>  taking it one step further, if you are placed at the McGlynn School and maybe your friend is at the Andrews or vice versa, you'll also have the opportunity to interact with students at the other middle school for the clubs, activities, and sports that we really want to encourage you to be a part of. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=321.023">So</a>  that's your answer to that question there.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=323.525">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=324.585">I</a>  think we have a good follow-up coming for that question.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=332.582">Hi,</a>  I'm Callaway and my pronouns are she, her. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=336.366">What</a>  are some of the after school clubs do you recommend? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=339.588">Can</a>  you describe a few?</p>

    <p>[Nick Tucci]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=342.791">All</a>  right, great question. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=343.752">What</a>  I'm gonna do is I'm gonna turn it over to a couple of our students answer that question. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=347.415">And</a>  I'll circle back if there's any missing elements.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=352.358">Um,</a>  so there are, like, so many clubs to join, uh, all with, like, different interests. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=357.643">Uh,</a>  like Mr. Choochoo said, there are sports as well, but some of the clubs are, like, the drama club, there's an art club, um, there's, like, a chess club, and, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=368.013">really,</a>  you get one of the first couple of weeks of school, like, before you kind of get into school, you get to see all the different clubs and who's going to be in them. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=379.277">And</a>  you get the chance to sign up with people from the Andrews. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=382.918">So</a>  it's really fun.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=387.299">And</a>  I did CCSR this year, which I think is a very good call because you get to help out your community and everyone around you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=396.122">And</a>  even like, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=397.123">people</a>  all across the world you can help out with like different like food drives or like giving clothing to other people around the world and all that stuff and the sporting for the school, like sports after school. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=411.326">I</a>  was on the middle school basketball team and all the kids were very nice and the coaches were very nice and everybody was just having a good time doing it and it was like a nice competitive atmosphere.</p>

    <p>[Nick Tucci]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=426.718">Great</a>  question there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=427.818">And</a>  that's actually one of my biggest piece of advice, too, as well, to get involved with a club sport activity right from the get-go. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=432.799">We'll</a>  have a Club and Activities Fair, as Nell alluded to, at the beginning of the school year next year. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=436.86">So</a>  you can look for that to happen sometime in September, one of the first weeks of school. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=441.12">We'll</a>  have that big fair with all the club's activities. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=443.501">We'll</a>  set up tables, and you'll be able to interact with the club members and their advisors, ask questions, and then join right there on the spot at that Club and Activities Fair. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=452.642">But</a>  certainly a really good thing to be a part of. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=454.723">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=458.273">My</a>  name is Mohammed and I have a question. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=461.577">So</a>  what are the teacher's expectations for students in middle school? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=466.782">And</a>  are they more strict with behavior and academics?</p>

    <p>[Nick Tucci]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=475.47">You</a>  know what, I'm gonna hear the feedback of the students too as well. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=478.433">Perhaps</a>  they can talk a little bit about their experiences, about how much homework they might get. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=482.397">But</a>  I would say that in middle school, I ask students to bring their ACE every single day to school. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=488.003">ACE</a>  is an acronym that stands for Attitude for A, C for Concentration and E for Effort. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=494.69">And</a>  I ask students to bring their ace every single day to school as they walk in through the doors. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=499.394">And</a>  I feel like if you have a good attitude, you're concentrating on your studies and you exert a good effort, you're surrounded by a lot of students and staff members that can help and support you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=507.78">And</a>  certainly we have high expectations. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=509.201">We</a>  want to see you, you know, learning in the classroom. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=511.403">We</a>  want to see you growing as a learner and you're going to be pushed. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=515.306">You</a>  know, you're not going to get better and you're not going to grow as a learner and as a person if your teachers don't push you certain days, but we have a lot <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=521.731">of</a>  fun to as well, you're going to meet a lot of new peers, you can interact with a lot of great educators, and you'll, you'll grow over the time your middle school career. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=528.88">I</a>  would say that, you know, you are going to, you know, come to see that probably the level of expectation and your academic rigor is going to increase from elementary to middle school. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=538.752">And</a>  I'll let the students kind of speak maybe a little bit to, you know, the amount of homework that they might get on a daily basis, and kind of help you understand from a student perspective a little bit more about the work that is expected of you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=550.22">So</a>  turn it over to Mal and Luke.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=554.722">Well,</a>  from my experience with that jump from like just that one, like it all kind of depends on what teacher you have, because <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=564.287">If</a>  you just have like one teacher in fifth grade, you know their expectations for you at all times. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=570.372">But</a>  then once you get to middle school, you have all different teachers with all different expectations and all different work. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=578.158">But</a>  most of the time, you'll only get, I would say, like an hour of homework at the very most for depending on what classes you take. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=591.228">So</a>  for me on side B, I've only this year got homework from ELA in math, but nothing from ancient civilizations or science yet, though you could get homework at any time or something to do at home.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=606.513">Is</a>  that enough?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=607.854">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=608.214">So</a>  I think the teachers, they'll like push you so that you learn, but they're never going to make you do something that they think you can't do. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=617.657">And</a>  like Mr. Tucci said, if you just try your hardest, it doesn't really matter how smart you are, because as long as they can see that you're trying, they'll help you and encourage you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=627.669">And</a>  yeah.</p>

    <p>[Nick Tucci]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=630.395">And</a>  on the topic of behavior, we certainly want to make sure that people are behaving themselves in school. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=634.44">If</a>  people are kind of misbehaving in school, it wouldn't really promote an atmosphere that's going to be conducive to learning. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=639.826">So,</a>  you know, we kind of follow the Mustang way here, you know, doing what is expected of you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=644.472">And</a>  we want you to respect people. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=645.934">We</a>  want to all get along and be collaborative and work together. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=648.897">And,</a>  you know, we have a good, helpful, fun school environment and we want that to stay the same. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=653.441">So</a>  we want people to come into middle school experience wanting to, you know, behave and meet our expectations and, you know, certainly we'll help you grow along the way as well. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=662.089">So,</a>  thanks for that question.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=664.211">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=664.591">Okay,</a>  I think we have our final question coming up.</p>

    <p>[Brothers]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=671.348">Hi,</a>  my name is Matthew and this question is going to be for the principal. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=676.799">Why</a>  did you choose to become a principal?</p>

    <p>[Nick Tucci]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=683.579">I</a>  chose to become a principal because I love kids and I love working with students, you know, and that's something you'll, you'll get to know about me or I'll get to know everybody's name, you know, here in the school, you know, you'll see me, you know, in the hallways and I'll be interacting with different people over the course of your time in middle school and I'll get to know who you are, you know, the course your time. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=702.949">because</a>  that's my driving principle, so to speak. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=706.312">I</a>  just like people, I like kids, and I like to see them grow. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=709.935">I</a>  grew up in Medford myself. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=711.136">I</a>  went through the Metro Public Schools. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=712.377">I</a>  have a lot of pride in the city of Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=714.719">I've</a>  had opportunities to go elsewhere, but I really and truly love being in the city of Medford and working in the public schools here. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=721.665">So,</a>  it's a great place to be in middle school because middle school students are really influential, you know, they're at like a crossroads in their life, where they have, you know, certain opportunities to be able to make very important decisions before they head off to high school about who they are as people. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=737.395">not</a>  just as learners, but as people in general. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=739.917">And</a>  I feel like as a principal, I can make an impact and touch them in various ways to help them find their success and reach their potential in a lot of different fashions. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=747.041">So</a>  that's a really good question, but I think to answer it and get to the crux of it, I became a principal because I really like students and I want to impact students and I wanted to choose a profession that was impactful. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=761.35">Not</a>  just a profession, I could just simply make money and it's a job. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=765.332">Certainly</a>  it's a job for me, but it's more than that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=768.534">It's</a>  such an important profession, being an educator, and being an instructional leader, and being a person that influences people. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=777.099">That's</a>  my answer for you.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=779.86">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=781.201">Those</a>  are all of our questions. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=783.763">I'm</a>  curious, Nell and Luke, if you could share your favorite part of middle school so far.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=791.982">So</a>  my favorite part of middle school so far has probably been like interacting with everybody because the classes like the teachers make them really fun but I've really enjoyed like in our exploratories and like working together and stuff and during clubs and like after school or before school that's probably my favorite part just meeting a lot of new people and like enjoying my time here.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=819.69">My</a>  favorite part, just like Noah, was like interacting with everybody and making new friends because at first I was a bit worried because most of my friends were on side A and I didn't think that I would see them as much. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=832.857">And</a>  you don't see them quite as much as the kids on your side, but I made tons of new friends this year from kids in my homeroom and all my core classes and exploratories. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=843.323">So</a>  it makes your middle school experience more fun the more people you meet. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=849.56">talk</a>  to and all of your teachers make it just as fun too.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=854.824">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=855.324">Thanks</a>  all three of you for being here with us today. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=857.145">I</a>  really appreciate your thoughtfulness in answering these questions.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=948.626">All</a>  right. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=949.866">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=950.287">So</a>  I have Gabe here who's going to ask you a question.</p>

    <p>[Brothers]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=955.049">Hello.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=955.789">My</a>  name is Gabriel Silva, and my pronouns are he, him. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=961.372">And</a>  I'd like to ask you guys a question. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=965.294">What</a>  is homework like in middle school? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=967.836">Is</a>  it every night? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=969.356">What</a>  happens when you don't complete your assignments? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=974.18">So</a>  basically, on B-SAT at least, as long as you have a due date for your assignment, it'll usually be a couple days after, so you'll have time to complete your homework. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=983.065">And</a>  usually, if you're reading a book, you'll have homework every night for that book to make sure you're reading. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=988.147">And</a>  you'll just have to make sure you keep up. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=989.708">And</a>  as long as you do manage your teacher, if it's late work, they'll probably give you a good amount of points for it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=995.111">All</a>  the teachers are different too, so they have different rules on when to turn in.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=1000.165">Hi,</a>  I'm Olivia. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=1001.166">My</a>  pronouns are she, her, two students. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=1003.988">Can</a>  you tell us what it is like to switch classes? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=1007.031">Is</a>  having more than one teacher difficult?</p>

    <p>[Brothers]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=1013.896">It's</a>  usually not confusing because all the classes are near each other. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=1017.879">And</a>  you just move to each class after each period and you get used to it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=1024.024">Yeah,</a>  and then you also schedule <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=1026.972">they'll</a>  give you schedules and make sure you always have the right class. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=1030.453">And</a>  yeah, pretty easy. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=1035.374">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=1037.395">Hi,</a>  I'm Jalen and my pronouns are she, her. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=1040.016">I</a>  have two questions to the students. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=1043.877">Can</a>  you describe what your first day of middle school was like? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=1048.318">It</a>  was very nerve wracking, to be honest, because it's a new school and there's a lot of new people here. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=1054.833">because</a>  all schools are mixing, but you'll make a lot of new friends and it gets it's really fun. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=1061.955">Yeah,</a>  my first day was really nervous. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=1063.936">But</a>  you know, the teachers are super nice on both sides. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=1069.858">And</a>  my other question is, do you have any advice for incoming sixth graders? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=1076.02">Just</a>  do your homework really? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=1079.601">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=1083.423">All</a>  right, we have our final question coming up.</p>

    <p>[Brothers]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=1138.396">Um,</a>  well, I really honestly just love talking to my friends. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=1142.62">And</a>  it's really fun because you also get to branch out a little bit because even though you're going to have like most of the same classes with the same people, you also have like different like exploratories with different people. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=1153.009">And</a>  you also have different like languages or maybe even a support class with different people.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5XuKm5L83RvX6sE1W8Cqbl?t=1158.253">And</a>  it's super fun.</p>
