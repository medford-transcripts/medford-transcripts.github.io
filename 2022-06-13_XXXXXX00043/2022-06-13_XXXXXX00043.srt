1
00:00:04,492 --> 00:00:05,593
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, Medford Bites listeners.

2
00:00:05,913 --> 00:00:11,618
[SPEAKER_10]: Today's episode was created completely by the students in Mr. Cormier's fifth grade class from the Roberts Elementary School.

3
00:00:12,619 --> 00:00:17,222
[SPEAKER_10]: As this end of the school year approaches, they wanted to explore their upcoming transition to middle school.

4
00:00:17,903 --> 00:00:26,330
[SPEAKER_10]: They prepared all of their own questions for the principals and students of both middle schools, as well as some of their favorite memories from elementary school and advice for students in younger grades.

5
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:27,711
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope you enjoy.

6
00:00:34,979 --> 00:00:37,041
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, thank you all so much for joining me today.

7
00:00:37,441 --> 00:00:40,803
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm here with Mr. Cormier's class at the Roberts Elementary School.

8
00:00:41,744 --> 00:00:48,870
[SPEAKER_10]: And we are going to be doing a little interview with some special guests today from the McGlynn Middle School.

9
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:53,933
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you on that end, could you just take a moment to introduce yourselves with your name and pronouns?

10
00:00:55,615 --> 00:00:56,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, good morning, everybody.

11
00:00:56,555 --> 00:00:59,818
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Mr. Tucci, and I'm the principal of the John J. McGlynn Middle School.

12
00:01:00,498 --> 00:01:02,040
[SPEAKER_02]: And my pronouns are he and him.

13
00:01:02,798 --> 00:01:04,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Turning it over to sixth grade students here.

14
00:01:05,002 --> 00:01:07,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Starting with Nell.

15
00:01:07,406 --> 00:01:10,991
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, I'm Nell Reese and my pronouns are she, her.

16
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:15,038
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, I'm Luti Martino and my pronouns are he, him.

17
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:16,771
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, thank you all.

18
00:01:16,831 --> 00:01:22,255
[SPEAKER_10]: So during every podcast, I always ask my guests what their favorite place to eat is in Medford.

19
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:25,418
[SPEAKER_10]: And Mr. Cormier's class did vote on this.

20
00:01:25,498 --> 00:01:31,442
[SPEAKER_10]: And their answers were number one, Bertucci's, number two, Avellino's, and number three was Domino's.

21
00:01:31,502 --> 00:01:34,065
[SPEAKER_10]: So lots of pizza over here.

22
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:40,810
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so the fifth graders here prepared some questions to ask you all about the transition to middle school.

23
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:44,333
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm gonna have them one at a time, ask their questions.

24
00:01:46,765 --> 00:01:57,791
[SPEAKER_08]: Where's john Hi, my name is john de mayo and my pronouns are are he and him.

25
00:01:58,892 --> 00:02:03,915
[SPEAKER_08]: What is the most challenging thing about the transition from elementary school and middle school.

26
00:02:07,609 --> 00:02:08,649
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to answer that question.

27
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:09,450
[SPEAKER_02]: Great question, by the way.

28
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:11,730
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to answer that question from the perspective of a principal.

29
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:21,453
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, one of the biggest challenges is from an academic standpoint, where you're not just going to have one primary teacher, like you might in elementary school, and you're now going to have a number of different teachers.

30
00:02:21,513 --> 00:02:25,094
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, you're going to be going to eight different periods throughout the course of a school day.

31
00:02:25,114 --> 00:02:31,316
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're going to have to meet the challenges and demands that each teacher sets forth for them on a given day.

32
00:02:32,036 --> 00:02:43,204
[SPEAKER_02]: So while that's a challenge, it's also an exciting part about the transition to middle school as well, being able to interact with different educators that are going to be involved in your day-to-day schedule.

33
00:02:43,224 --> 00:02:47,847
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to turn it over to Nell and Luke to answer the questions from a student standpoint.

34
00:02:48,783 --> 00:02:54,764
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, well, for me, the most challenging part was, uh, really like memorizing and getting my schedule down.

35
00:02:55,504 --> 00:03:00,645
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, because I was used to just sitting with one teacher all day in my classroom.

36
00:03:00,865 --> 00:03:16,768
[SPEAKER_01]: But then once I started getting a schedule where I had one teacher for like back-to-back classes, like a double block, and then, um, another like teacher for just one class, it was like, it kind of confused you at first, but then once you get your schedule down, it makes it a lot easier

37
00:03:17,332 --> 00:03:21,836
[SPEAKER_01]: and your days just fly by because they feel even quicker when you teach every period.

38
00:03:23,917 --> 00:03:26,819
[SPEAKER_09]: For me, it was also probably the schedule.

39
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:31,403
[SPEAKER_09]: On the first day I got lost because you have to go to different floors for some classes.

40
00:03:32,984 --> 00:03:42,271
[SPEAKER_09]: But after I got used to where all my classes were, like Luke said, the classes went by quickly because you got new teachers and points of views and stuff.

41
00:03:45,021 --> 00:03:50,323
[SPEAKER_09]: is explained really well and they can also stay after school to help you if you get confused or anything.

42
00:03:51,603 --> 00:03:52,564
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

43
00:03:53,844 --> 00:03:54,284
[SPEAKER_10]: Davi.

44
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:00,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, I'm Davi.

45
00:04:01,247 --> 00:04:02,707
[SPEAKER_04]: My pronouns are he, him.

46
00:04:03,687 --> 00:04:05,548
[SPEAKER_04]: And this can be answered by any one of you.

47
00:04:05,568 --> 00:04:10,870
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to know, will I still see my friends in side A if I'm in side B?

48
00:04:13,897 --> 00:04:14,537
[SPEAKER_02]: David, thanks.

49
00:04:14,617 --> 00:04:15,178
[SPEAKER_02]: Great question.

50
00:04:15,858 --> 00:04:16,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

51
00:04:16,518 --> 00:04:19,400
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll be able to see your friends if you're placed on one side or the other.

52
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,582
[SPEAKER_02]: There are many opportunities for that before school and even during school.

53
00:04:25,082 --> 00:04:27,483
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we all eat lunch in the cafeteria together.

54
00:04:27,543 --> 00:04:29,244
[SPEAKER_02]: We all go outside to recess together.

55
00:04:30,065 --> 00:04:36,648
[SPEAKER_02]: And certainly you'll be on your respective side, whether it be side A or side B for your core classes.

56
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:40,231
[SPEAKER_02]: meaning classes like math, English, social studies, and science.

57
00:04:40,931 --> 00:04:59,027
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you go to your exploratory classes, you'll have the opportunity to be able to be a part of exploratory classes with people mixed up from both side A and side B. One last thing I'll note is that after-school activities are going to be something we're really going to encourage you to be a part of, join a club, a sport, an activity.

58
00:04:59,867 --> 00:05:04,872
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly, you'll have the opportunity to be able to interact with people on both sides in those clubs, sports, and activities.

59
00:05:05,592 --> 00:05:20,603
[SPEAKER_02]: And taking it one step further, if you are placed at the McGlynn School and maybe your friend is at the Andrews or vice versa, you'll also have the opportunity to interact with students at the other middle school for the clubs, activities, and sports that we really want to encourage you to be a part of.

60
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,564
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's your answer to that question there.

61
00:05:23,525 --> 00:05:23,865
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

62
00:05:24,585 --> 00:05:26,747
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we have a good follow-up coming for that question.

63
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:35,165
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, I'm Callaway and my pronouns are she, her.

64
00:05:36,366 --> 00:05:39,508
[SPEAKER_05]: What are some of the after school clubs do you recommend?

65
00:05:39,588 --> 00:05:40,609
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you describe a few?

66
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:43,732
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, great question.

67
00:05:43,752 --> 00:05:47,395
[SPEAKER_02]: What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna turn it over to a couple of our students answer that question.

68
00:05:47,415 --> 00:05:49,417
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll circle back if there's any missing elements.

69
00:05:52,358 --> 00:05:57,183
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so there are, like, so many clubs to join, uh, all with, like, different interests.

70
00:05:57,643 --> 00:06:06,852
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, like Mr. Choochoo said, there are sports as well, but some of the clubs are, like, the drama club, there's an art club, um, there's, like, a chess club, and,

71
00:06:08,013 --> 00:06:19,056
[SPEAKER_09]: really, you get one of the first couple of weeks of school, like, before you kind of get into school, you get to see all the different clubs and who's going to be in them.

72
00:06:19,277 --> 00:06:22,858
[SPEAKER_09]: And you get the chance to sign up with people from the Andrews.

73
00:06:22,918 --> 00:06:24,598
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's really fun.

74
00:06:27,299 --> 00:06:36,002
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did CCSR this year, which I think is a very good call because you get to help out your community and everyone around you.

75
00:06:36,122 --> 00:06:36,662
[SPEAKER_01]: And even like,

76
00:06:37,123 --> 00:06:50,806
[SPEAKER_01]: people all across the world you can help out with like different like food drives or like giving clothing to other people around the world and all that stuff and the sporting for the school, like sports after school.

77
00:06:51,326 --> 00:07:03,029
[SPEAKER_01]: I was on the middle school basketball team and all the kids were very nice and the coaches were very nice and everybody was just having a good time doing it and it was like a nice competitive atmosphere.

78
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:07,418
[SPEAKER_02]: Great question there.

79
00:07:07,818 --> 00:07:12,719
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's actually one of my biggest piece of advice, too, as well, to get involved with a club sport activity right from the get-go.

80
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:16,460
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have a Club and Activities Fair, as Nell alluded to, at the beginning of the school year next year.

81
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:21,100
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can look for that to happen sometime in September, one of the first weeks of school.

82
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,481
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have that big fair with all the club's activities.

83
00:07:23,501 --> 00:07:32,602
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll set up tables, and you'll be able to interact with the club members and their advisors, ask questions, and then join right there on the spot at that Club and Activities Fair.

84
00:07:32,642 --> 00:07:34,703
[SPEAKER_02]: But certainly a really good thing to be a part of.

85
00:07:34,723 --> 00:07:35,783
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

86
00:07:38,273 --> 00:07:41,517
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Mohammed and I have a question.

87
00:07:41,577 --> 00:07:46,322
[SPEAKER_03]: So what are the teacher's expectations for students in middle school?

88
00:07:46,782 --> 00:07:50,166
[SPEAKER_03]: And are they more strict with behavior and academics?

89
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:58,393
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what, I'm gonna hear the feedback of the students too as well.

90
00:07:58,433 --> 00:08:01,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Perhaps they can talk a little bit about their experiences, about how much homework they might get.

91
00:08:02,397 --> 00:08:07,583
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would say that in middle school, I ask students to bring their ACE every single day to school.

92
00:08:08,003 --> 00:08:14,009
[SPEAKER_02]: ACE is an acronym that stands for Attitude for A, C for Concentration and E for Effort.

93
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:18,573
[SPEAKER_02]: And I ask students to bring their ace every single day to school as they walk in through the doors.

94
00:08:19,394 --> 00:08:27,280
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like if you have a good attitude, you're concentrating on your studies and you exert a good effort, you're surrounded by a lot of students and staff members that can help and support you.

95
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,161
[SPEAKER_02]: And certainly we have high expectations.

96
00:08:29,201 --> 00:08:31,383
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to see you, you know, learning in the classroom.

97
00:08:31,403 --> 00:08:34,786
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to see you growing as a learner and you're going to be pushed.

98
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:41,671
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you're not going to get better and you're not going to grow as a learner and as a person if your teachers don't push you certain days, but we have a lot

99
00:08:41,731 --> 00:08:48,860
[SPEAKER_02]: of fun to as well, you're going to meet a lot of new peers, you can interact with a lot of great educators, and you'll, you'll grow over the time your middle school career.

100
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:57,871
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say that, you know, you are going to, you know, come to see that probably the level of expectation and your academic rigor is going to increase from elementary to middle school.

101
00:08:58,752 --> 00:09:10,120
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll let the students kind of speak maybe a little bit to, you know, the amount of homework that they might get on a daily basis, and kind of help you understand from a student perspective a little bit more about the work that is expected of you.

102
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:14,422
[SPEAKER_02]: So turn it over to Mal and Luke.

103
00:09:14,722 --> 00:09:22,147
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, from my experience with that jump from like just that one, like it all kind of depends on what teacher you have, because

104
00:09:24,287 --> 00:09:30,272
[SPEAKER_01]: If you just have like one teacher in fifth grade, you know their expectations for you at all times.

105
00:09:30,372 --> 00:09:38,038
[SPEAKER_01]: But then once you get to middle school, you have all different teachers with all different expectations and all different work.

106
00:09:38,158 --> 00:09:49,326
[SPEAKER_01]: But most of the time, you'll only get, I would say, like an hour of homework at the very most for depending on what classes you take.

107
00:09:51,228 --> 00:10:05,433
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me on side B, I've only this year got homework from ELA in math, but nothing from ancient civilizations or science yet, though you could get homework at any time or something to do at home.

108
00:10:06,513 --> 00:10:07,694
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that enough?

109
00:10:07,854 --> 00:10:08,154
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

110
00:10:08,214 --> 00:10:16,417
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think the teachers, they'll like push you so that you learn, but they're never going to make you do something that they think you can't do.

111
00:10:17,657 --> 00:10:27,488
[SPEAKER_09]: And like Mr. Tucci said, if you just try your hardest, it doesn't really matter how smart you are, because as long as they can see that you're trying, they'll help you and encourage you.

112
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:28,670
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah.

113
00:10:30,395 --> 00:10:34,400
[SPEAKER_02]: And on the topic of behavior, we certainly want to make sure that people are behaving themselves in school.

114
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:39,806
[SPEAKER_02]: If people are kind of misbehaving in school, it wouldn't really promote an atmosphere that's going to be conducive to learning.

115
00:10:39,826 --> 00:10:44,252
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, we kind of follow the Mustang way here, you know, doing what is expected of you.

116
00:10:44,472 --> 00:10:45,774
[SPEAKER_02]: And we want you to respect people.

117
00:10:45,934 --> 00:10:48,217
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to all get along and be collaborative and work together.

118
00:10:48,897 --> 00:10:53,121
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we have a good, helpful, fun school environment and we want that to stay the same.

119
00:10:53,441 --> 00:11:01,749
[SPEAKER_02]: So we want people to come into middle school experience wanting to, you know, behave and meet our expectations and, you know, certainly we'll help you grow along the way as well.

120
00:11:02,089 --> 00:11:03,590
[SPEAKER_02]: So, thanks for that question.

121
00:11:04,211 --> 00:11:04,571
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

122
00:11:04,591 --> 00:11:07,614
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I think we have our final question coming up.

123
00:11:11,348 --> 00:11:16,318
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, my name is Matthew and this question is going to be for the principal.

124
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:19,283
[SPEAKER_08]: Why did you choose to become a principal?

125
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:42,269
[SPEAKER_02]: I chose to become a principal because I love kids and I love working with students, you know, and that's something you'll, you'll get to know about me or I'll get to know everybody's name, you know, here in the school, you know, you'll see me, you know, in the hallways and I'll be interacting with different people over the course of your time in middle school and I'll get to know who you are, you know, the course your time.

126
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:45,491
[SPEAKER_02]: because that's my driving principle, so to speak.

127
00:11:46,312 --> 00:11:49,074
[SPEAKER_02]: I just like people, I like kids, and I like to see them grow.

128
00:11:49,935 --> 00:11:51,096
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew up in Medford myself.

129
00:11:51,136 --> 00:11:52,357
[SPEAKER_02]: I went through the Metro Public Schools.

130
00:11:52,377 --> 00:11:53,879
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a lot of pride in the city of Medford.

131
00:11:54,719 --> 00:12:00,985
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had opportunities to go elsewhere, but I really and truly love being in the city of Medford and working in the public schools here.

132
00:12:01,665 --> 00:12:16,535
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it's a great place to be in middle school because middle school students are really influential, you know, they're at like a crossroads in their life, where they have, you know, certain opportunities to be able to make very important decisions before they head off to high school about who they are as people.

133
00:12:17,395 --> 00:12:19,317
[SPEAKER_02]: not just as learners, but as people in general.

134
00:12:19,917 --> 00:12:26,981
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like as a principal, I can make an impact and touch them in various ways to help them find their success and reach their potential in a lot of different fashions.

135
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:40,490
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a really good question, but I think to answer it and get to the crux of it, I became a principal because I really like students and I want to impact students and I wanted to choose a profession that was impactful.

136
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:44,572
[SPEAKER_02]: Not just a profession, I could just simply make money and it's a job.

137
00:12:45,332 --> 00:12:48,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly it's a job for me, but it's more than that.

138
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:56,238
[SPEAKER_02]: It's such an important profession, being an educator, and being an instructional leader, and being a person that influences people.

139
00:12:57,099 --> 00:12:58,019
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my answer for you.

140
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:00,241
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

141
00:13:01,201 --> 00:13:02,942
[SPEAKER_10]: Those are all of our questions.

142
00:13:03,763 --> 00:13:07,785
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm curious, Nell and Luke, if you could share your favorite part of middle school so far.

143
00:13:11,982 --> 00:13:36,797
[SPEAKER_09]: So my favorite part of middle school so far has probably been like interacting with everybody because the classes like the teachers make them really fun but I've really enjoyed like in our exploratories and like working together and stuff and during clubs and like after school or before school that's probably my favorite part just meeting a lot of new people and like enjoying my time here.

144
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:52,137
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite part, just like Noah, was like interacting with everybody and making new friends because at first I was a bit worried because most of my friends were on side A and I didn't think that I would see them as much.

145
00:13:52,857 --> 00:14:02,783
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't see them quite as much as the kids on your side, but I made tons of new friends this year from kids in my homeroom and all my core classes and exploratories.

146
00:14:03,323 --> 00:14:08,926
[SPEAKER_01]: So it makes your middle school experience more fun the more people you meet.

147
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:13,263
[SPEAKER_01]: talk to and all of your teachers make it just as fun too.

148
00:14:14,824 --> 00:14:15,144
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

149
00:14:15,324 --> 00:14:17,125
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks all three of you for being here with us today.

150
00:14:17,145 --> 00:14:19,607
[SPEAKER_10]: I really appreciate your thoughtfulness in answering these questions.

151
00:14:22,532 --> 00:14:23,792
[SPEAKER_02]: You are very, very welcome.

152
00:14:24,012 --> 00:14:26,333
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys had some really fantastic questions too as well.

153
00:14:26,393 --> 00:14:32,694
[SPEAKER_02]: So that tells a lot about you guys in terms of your level of thoughtfulness going into this presentation and this podcast.

154
00:14:32,734 --> 00:14:35,234
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you all for inviting us to be a part of it.

155
00:14:35,855 --> 00:14:40,235
[SPEAKER_02]: We're certainly happy to help in your transition from elementary to middle school.

156
00:14:40,696 --> 00:14:47,737
[SPEAKER_02]: And as I said in the open house a few weeks back, which these folks were involved into as well, I'm very happy to meet

157
00:14:48,658 --> 00:14:50,519
[SPEAKER_02]: you guys over the summertime even too as well.

158
00:14:50,659 --> 00:14:56,804
[SPEAKER_02]: If you'd ever like to set up an appointment with myself as a principal, I'm happy to meet you in advance of the school year to support you.

159
00:14:57,245 --> 00:15:04,511
[SPEAKER_02]: And be on the lookout for a sixth grade orientation coming up in the middle of August in preparation for the start of next school year.

160
00:15:04,531 --> 00:15:07,213
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll usually have like a barbecue or slush too as well to go along with that.

161
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:08,114
[SPEAKER_02]: So looking forward to that.

162
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:13,739
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the meantime, have a great, wonderful end of this school year and a wonderful summer.

163
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:15,531
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, thank you.

164
00:15:17,492 --> 00:15:17,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome.

165
00:15:20,974 --> 00:15:24,116
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, now we're here with the Andrews Middle School.

166
00:15:24,437 --> 00:15:25,858
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks so much for joining us today.

167
00:15:26,638 --> 00:15:29,820
[SPEAKER_10]: If you guys could just start by introducing yourselves, your name and pronouns.

168
00:15:30,661 --> 00:15:31,902
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm Mr. Downs.

169
00:15:31,922 --> 00:15:34,583
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the principal of the Andrews Middle School.

170
00:15:35,044 --> 00:15:36,905
[SPEAKER_00]: I just go by him, or he.

171
00:15:38,506 --> 00:15:39,847
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, I'm Olivia O'Brien.

172
00:15:40,027 --> 00:15:42,889
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a sixth grader at the Andrews Middle School and my pronouns are she, her.

173
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:44,363
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Georgia Scott.

174
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:46,404
[SPEAKER_08]: I go to Daniels Middle School.

175
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:48,606
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm in my she, her, and I'm in sixth grade.

176
00:15:48,626 --> 00:15:49,786
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

177
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:50,266
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

178
00:15:50,287 --> 00:15:53,048
[SPEAKER_10]: So I have Gabe here who's going to ask you a question.

179
00:15:55,049 --> 00:15:55,429
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello.

180
00:15:55,789 --> 00:16:00,732
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Gabriel Silva, and my pronouns are he, him.

181
00:16:01,372 --> 00:16:03,613
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'd like to ask you guys a question.

182
00:16:05,294 --> 00:16:07,155
[SPEAKER_08]: What is homework like in middle school?

183
00:16:07,836 --> 00:16:08,636
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it every night?

184
00:16:09,356 --> 00:16:11,938
[SPEAKER_08]: What happens when you don't complete your assignments?

185
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:22,804
[SPEAKER_08]: So basically, on B-SAT at least, as long as you have a due date for your assignment, it'll usually be a couple days after, so you'll have time to complete your homework.

186
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:27,427
[SPEAKER_08]: And usually, if you're reading a book, you'll have homework every night for that book to make sure you're reading.

187
00:16:28,147 --> 00:16:29,668
[SPEAKER_08]: And you'll just have to make sure you keep up.

188
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:34,831
[SPEAKER_08]: And as long as you do manage your teacher, if it's late work, they'll probably give you a good amount of points for it.

189
00:16:35,111 --> 00:16:39,213
[SPEAKER_08]: All the teachers are different too, so they have different rules on when to turn in.

190
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:40,966
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, I'm Olivia.

191
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,648
[SPEAKER_05]: My pronouns are she, her, two students.

192
00:16:43,988 --> 00:16:46,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you tell us what it is like to switch classes?

193
00:16:47,031 --> 00:16:49,613
[SPEAKER_05]: Is having more than one teacher difficult?

194
00:16:53,896 --> 00:16:57,859
[SPEAKER_08]: It's usually not confusing because all the classes are near each other.

195
00:16:57,879 --> 00:17:03,684
[SPEAKER_08]: And you just move to each class after each period and you get used to it.

196
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:05,405
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and then you also schedule

197
00:17:06,972 --> 00:17:10,133
[SPEAKER_08]: they'll give you schedules and make sure you always have the right class.

198
00:17:10,453 --> 00:17:13,854
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, pretty easy.

199
00:17:15,374 --> 00:17:15,575
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

200
00:17:17,395 --> 00:17:19,836
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, I'm Jalen and my pronouns are she, her.

201
00:17:20,016 --> 00:17:22,197
[SPEAKER_08]: I have two questions to the students.

202
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:26,238
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you describe what your first day of middle school was like?

203
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:33,880
[SPEAKER_08]: It was very nerve wracking, to be honest, because it's a new school and there's a lot of new people here.

204
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:41,515
[SPEAKER_08]: because all schools are mixing, but you'll make a lot of new friends and it gets it's really fun.

205
00:17:41,955 --> 00:17:43,796
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, my first day was really nervous.

206
00:17:43,936 --> 00:17:47,657
[SPEAKER_08]: But you know, the teachers are super nice on both sides.

207
00:17:49,858 --> 00:17:54,119
[SPEAKER_08]: And my other question is, do you have any advice for incoming sixth graders?

208
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:58,621
[SPEAKER_08]: Just do your homework really?

209
00:17:59,601 --> 00:17:59,801
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

210
00:18:03,423 --> 00:18:05,544
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, we have our final question coming up.

211
00:18:09,447 --> 00:18:10,908
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, my name is Charles.

212
00:18:11,408 --> 00:18:14,830
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a question for the principal and my pronouns are she, him.

213
00:18:16,091 --> 00:18:19,273
[SPEAKER_08]: Are there any house rules you think we should know before entering middle school?

214
00:18:20,274 --> 00:18:21,074
[SPEAKER_00]: Any house rules?

215
00:18:21,575 --> 00:18:21,795
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

216
00:18:22,035 --> 00:18:26,438
[SPEAKER_00]: So each team has their own rules and expectations.

217
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:27,518
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very similar though.

218
00:18:27,859 --> 00:18:32,882
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we ask here at the Andrews is that we model excellence and responsibility and respect.

219
00:18:33,396 --> 00:18:38,982
[SPEAKER_00]: You're responsible for yourself, and we ask you to be respectful to not only others, but yourself at the same time.

220
00:18:39,522 --> 00:18:40,363
[SPEAKER_00]: Very simple here.

221
00:18:40,723 --> 00:18:43,406
[SPEAKER_00]: Just follow that model, and you're going to be just fine.

222
00:18:44,507 --> 00:18:44,847
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

223
00:18:45,668 --> 00:18:46,049
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

224
00:18:46,689 --> 00:18:54,237
[SPEAKER_10]: Before we end our talk right now, I was wondering if the students, if you could share the best part of middle school so far.

225
00:18:58,396 --> 00:19:02,280
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, well, I really honestly just love talking to my friends.

226
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:12,969
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's really fun because you also get to branch out a little bit because even though you're going to have like most of the same classes with the same people, you also have like different like exploratories with different people.

227
00:19:13,009 --> 00:19:18,233
[SPEAKER_08]: And you also have different like languages or maybe even a support class with different people.

228
00:19:18,253 --> 00:19:19,034
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's super fun.

229
00:19:20,095 --> 00:19:25,680
[SPEAKER_08]: I like how we have different teachers because because they're both more focused on

230
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,271
[SPEAKER_08]: what questions you have in each subject.

231
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:32,173
[SPEAKER_10]: Great, so teachers that are experts in their subjects.

232
00:19:33,493 --> 00:19:35,774
[SPEAKER_10]: Great, well thank you all so much for joining us.

233
00:19:36,515 --> 00:19:37,775
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys for having us.

234
00:19:38,816 --> 00:19:41,397
[SPEAKER_00]: We look forward to seeing our incoming sixth graders next year.

235
00:19:41,417 --> 00:19:43,658
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, thank you.

236
00:19:44,199 --> 00:19:45,279
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys, have a good day.

237
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:52,923
[SPEAKER_10]: The students from Mr. Cormier's fifth grade class wanted to share some memories of elementary school.

238
00:19:55,341 --> 00:19:58,864
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, my name is Alyssa Bucknum, and my pronouns are she, her.

239
00:19:59,324 --> 00:20:03,367
[SPEAKER_08]: And my favorite elementary school memory is when we got to play with the parachute in the gym.

240
00:20:03,968 --> 00:20:09,833
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of the best things we got to do are games such as Tom and Jerry and Shark in the Lifeguard.

241
00:20:10,874 --> 00:20:13,536
[SPEAKER_08]: We also got to lift the parachute up and go inside it.

242
00:20:13,956 --> 00:20:16,818
[SPEAKER_08]: Or we got to go on top of it and pop the bubble of air.

243
00:20:17,399 --> 00:20:18,660
[SPEAKER_08]: The parachute was the best.

244
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:19,701
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to miss it.

245
00:20:22,935 --> 00:20:27,597
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, my name is Adan and I go by he or him.

246
00:20:28,157 --> 00:20:32,419
[SPEAKER_08]: My favorite memory from elementary school was the second grade field trip.

247
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:36,141
[SPEAKER_08]: We got to go to Legoland, which I'd never been to before.

248
00:20:37,401 --> 00:20:41,223
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was amazed about like all the Lego sets there.

249
00:20:42,364 --> 00:20:47,386
[SPEAKER_08]: And the best part of it was definitely like a little movie trailer thing.

250
00:20:49,145 --> 00:20:52,172
[SPEAKER_08]: They sprayed like some stuff, they gave us 3D glasses.

251
00:20:52,192 --> 00:20:56,181
[SPEAKER_08]: Now that I look back at it, I really have wanted to go back ever since.

252
00:20:57,364 --> 00:20:58,226
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my favorite memory.

253
00:21:00,572 --> 00:21:05,356
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, my name is Mark Marino and my pronouns are he, him.

254
00:21:06,356 --> 00:21:09,038
[SPEAKER_08]: My favorite elementary school memory was switching schools.

255
00:21:09,499 --> 00:21:16,244
[SPEAKER_08]: This is my favorite memory because the school was easier, days were shorter, and I got to make new friends.

256
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:22,548
[SPEAKER_08]: We switched schools because my old school was saying my brother might have to stay back and it was getting hard.

257
00:21:23,069 --> 00:21:28,453
[SPEAKER_08]: When COVID hit, things were bad because there was no Zoom so we had to watch videos on our work.

258
00:21:29,233 --> 00:21:35,515
[SPEAKER_08]: When we heard we were coming to this school, me and my brother were happy, but we were a little sad because we wouldn't miss our friends.

259
00:21:36,115 --> 00:21:44,298
[SPEAKER_08]: We came to the Roberts, we made new friends on the first day, and that's why switching schools was my favorite memory, and that was my favorite memory I have had in school.

260
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:51,944
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Michael Sumitakis and my pronouns are him and he.

261
00:21:52,745 --> 00:21:56,048
[SPEAKER_07]: My favorite memory I had at this school was probably when I was in second grade in Ms.

262
00:21:56,089 --> 00:21:56,709
[SPEAKER_07]: Keller's class.

263
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:02,896
[SPEAKER_07]: We did this project where we wrote on a giant paper and wrote about our future and where we wanted to live when we grow up.

264
00:22:03,537 --> 00:22:07,721
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember I wanted to be a basketball player and stay close to where I live in Boston.

265
00:22:08,442 --> 00:22:16,590
[SPEAKER_07]: On the day we read our speeches to our classmates and their parents, I remember walking in with a Celtics jersey.

266
00:22:17,231 --> 00:22:21,976
[SPEAKER_07]: When I read my speech, I wore sunglasses as the writing project was called My Future's Looking Bright.

267
00:22:23,237 --> 00:22:24,779
[SPEAKER_07]: This was a project I would never forget.

268
00:22:27,773 --> 00:22:31,655
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, my name is James Moreno and my pronouns are he slash him.

269
00:22:32,855 --> 00:22:36,657
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember when I came to the Roberts School the first time.

270
00:22:37,177 --> 00:22:40,738
[SPEAKER_08]: I came here last year for fourth grade and I had Mrs. Nevers.

271
00:22:41,139 --> 00:22:46,681
[SPEAKER_08]: We had to start off at home on Zoom, but then by the end of the year, I saw her in person.

272
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:53,404
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought this school was a really great school because I met a lot of good friends and teachers.

273
00:22:54,184 --> 00:23:01,149
[SPEAKER_08]: I was excited to go to fifth grade and I would imagine what it would be like in fifth grade while in class.

274
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:04,612
[SPEAKER_08]: That was my favorite memory when I came to this school.

275
00:23:08,735 --> 00:23:12,618
[SPEAKER_10]: And finally, Mr. Cormier's class would like to share some advice for younger students.

276
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:18,843
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, I'm Lucy McSheffery and I go by she her and I have some advice for a fourth grader.

277
00:23:19,723 --> 00:23:22,986
[SPEAKER_06]: Once you finish fifth grade, you'll look back and wonder why you ever worried.

278
00:23:26,032 --> 00:23:30,154
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, my name is Gabrielle and my pronouns are she, her.

279
00:23:30,734 --> 00:23:34,735
[SPEAKER_08]: You might be nervous about going into fifth grade, but it's really nothing to worry about.

280
00:23:35,296 --> 00:23:39,417
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't get me wrong, fifth grade can be difficult at times, but don't stress, you'll be fine.

281
00:23:39,977 --> 00:23:41,338
[SPEAKER_08]: Fifth grade is actually a lot of fun.

282
00:23:41,778 --> 00:23:44,519
[SPEAKER_08]: There are a lot of fun activities to look forward to at the end of the year.

283
00:23:44,899 --> 00:23:46,620
[SPEAKER_08]: The motto is don't worry, be happy.

284
00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:51,554
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, I'm Gianna Sullivan, and I grew up by she, her.

285
00:23:52,335 --> 00:23:56,556
[SPEAKER_08]: And I have some advice for incoming fourth graders.

286
00:23:57,297 --> 00:24:01,418
[SPEAKER_05]: Since fifth grade is the last year of elementary school, it may seem scary.

287
00:24:02,059 --> 00:24:04,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Even if things get hard, you have to tell yourself, I can do it.

288
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,741
[SPEAKER_08]: Always give a test your best shot.

289
00:24:07,401 --> 00:24:12,803
[SPEAKER_08]: You will always have to be ready for a new chapter in school because there could be a harder lesson in any subject.

290
00:24:13,323 --> 00:24:17,165
[SPEAKER_08]: The last thing I want to tell you is make good decisions in school so you don't get in trouble.

291
00:24:18,972 --> 00:24:20,413
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, my name is Matthew.

292
00:24:21,094 --> 00:24:23,335
[SPEAKER_08]: My pronouns are he, him.

293
00:24:26,237 --> 00:24:37,605
[SPEAKER_08]: If you get Mr. Cornell as a fifth grade teacher, you will have to be ready for a few things, like a sharing project, which is a book report.

294
00:24:38,566 --> 00:24:43,529
[SPEAKER_08]: You will have to read a book, type a summary, and make a project.

295
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:48,033
[SPEAKER_08]: It might seem like a lot, but it's not that hard to do.

296
00:24:51,715 --> 00:24:52,737
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, my name is Charles.

297
00:24:52,798 --> 00:24:53,238
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm back.

298
00:24:54,862 --> 00:24:57,568
[SPEAKER_08]: I have some advice for all those fourth graders coming up to fifth grade.

299
00:24:58,348 --> 00:25:01,190
[SPEAKER_08]: This grade seems like it will be scary, but you have nothing to worry about.

300
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:02,051
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's why.

301
00:25:02,591 --> 00:25:03,812
[SPEAKER_08]: First, don't be afraid.

302
00:25:04,192 --> 00:25:07,875
[SPEAKER_08]: It's always hard to do something new, but you'll get the hang of the grade and show it who's boss.

303
00:25:08,596 --> 00:25:10,817
[SPEAKER_08]: Next, don't let tests frighten you.

304
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:14,160
[SPEAKER_08]: They get bigger, but the amazing teachers will help you do great.

305
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:23,127
[SPEAKER_08]: Finally, if you are seriously down in the dumps, in the Roberts, you get to be part of the student council, where you prepare fundraisers and spirit days for the entire school.

306
00:25:23,447 --> 00:25:27,530
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all the advice I can give for those fourth graders coming up to the final grade at elementary school.

307
00:25:27,953 --> 00:25:28,453
[SPEAKER_05]: fifth grade.

308
00:25:30,994 --> 00:25:32,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, I'm Emma McCormick.

309
00:25:32,334 --> 00:25:33,615
[SPEAKER_05]: I go by she or her.

310
00:25:34,315 --> 00:25:36,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Going to fifth grade might seem scary.

311
00:25:36,396 --> 00:25:37,916
[SPEAKER_05]: All the teachers are really nice though.

312
00:25:38,276 --> 00:25:40,657
[SPEAKER_05]: Some stuff might look hard, but it will be easy.

313
00:25:40,757 --> 00:25:44,958
[SPEAKER_05]: I was nervous too, but it got easier as the time went on.

314
00:25:45,078 --> 00:25:45,718
[SPEAKER_05]: So don't worry.

315
00:25:45,738 --> 00:25:47,459
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

316
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:51,400
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much to Mr. Cormier's class and congratulations on finishing fifth grade.

317
00:25:59,875 --> 00:26:03,857
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much to Mr. Cormier's class, as well as the principals and students from the middle schools.

318
00:26:04,538 --> 00:26:08,440
[SPEAKER_10]: Congratulations on approaching the completion of another year for all Medford students.
