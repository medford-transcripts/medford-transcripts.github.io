    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=94.688s">Mr.</a>  President, if I may present these to you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=97.17s">I</a>  would appreciate it, Councilor Tarullo, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=113.284s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=117.353s">Okay,</a>  17644 offered by Councilor Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=120.741s">Be</a>  it resolved that the Medford City Council be appraised of the past, present, and future planning that has been and will be taking place to evaluate the increase in residential units and the impact it is having on our public safety personnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=134.112s">Be</a>  it further resolved that if there is a plan to increase our public safety personnel numbers and locations to accommodate the increase in population, it be provided to the Medford City Council <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=147.801s">If</a>  there is no plan, be it resolved that one be put in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=151.684s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=153.005s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=154.727s">This</a>  is one of the three or four that I put on last week, and I think I have two additional resolutions on this week that relate to the development in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=164.815s">I</a>  just wanted to get some answers and see if the discussion has been started, and if not, get the discussion started, get the <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=175.592s">conversations</a>  started with regards to anything and everything that development in the community could be impacted by. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=183.518s">And</a>  one of those areas is our public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=187.721s">We</a>  all know that our numbers are stable but low. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=192.725s">We're</a>  able to provide services as best we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=195.728s">We</a>  see the police and fire and DPW do all that they can. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=200.071s">But</a>  when you talk to <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=202.83s">a</a>  firefighter or a police officer, they do have questions with regards to when are levels going to be increased. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=209.795s">We</a>  seem to always be hiring additional personnel, but it almost seems like we're just filling retirement positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=219.181s">And</a>  it seems like with the development that potentially <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=223.965s">has</a>  been approved or development that is potentially going to be approved in certain areas within our city that are gonna be developed, I think we need to get a round table discussion if it hasn't happened already with the chief of police, the chief of fire, DPW commissioner, personnel in the mayor's department, the city council and the community and figure out what may be needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=250.577s">I</a>  mean, I've heard that there's a ladder truck <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=253.642s">out</a>  of service as of this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=256.689s">definitely</a>  heard rumblings that certain stations are not active with regards to the fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=263.912s">You</a>  always hear that public safety and the police department is understaffed and that we need more personnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=270.075s">So</a>  what are we gonna do if we're gonna have 500 units plus at potentially multiple areas in this city? <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=279.339s">Are</a>  we going to expand and open more stations? <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=283.581s">Are</a>  we gonna try to increase our numbers <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=286.315s">police</a>  and fire and DPW so we can handle the load. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=290.317s">And</a>  this is just one area that needs to just be discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=294.739s">I</a>  think that it's come to light other areas and people are starting the conversation, but I feel like we all need to be on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=301.582s">We</a>  need to be privy to how we're going to handle it and make sure it's handled accordingly so that we can keep our residents current and future residents safe within our community.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=313.858s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=315.019s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=316.161s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=317.142s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Longo-Kurt for this wonderful resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=322.688s">I'd</a>  be particularly curious as to see where our population is. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=327.594s">Is</a>  it actually growing? <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=329.456s">or</a>  is the development just reflecting a spread in population and a diminishment in people per domicile? <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=342.438s">I'd</a>  also like to see how our present current public safety numbers and our other city service numbers as far as employees delivering services to the city, police, fire, DPW, <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=357.561s">reflects</a>  what we are now as a community of 56,000 as a comparison to when we were a community, I think, at our height in the 60s, 70s was 65, 68,000, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=374.087s">So</a>  that would be a worthwhile consideration when we have this conversation, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=380.369s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=383.627s">On</a>  motion by Councilor Lococo to send this to the mayor for her action. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=390.152s">Seconded</a>  by?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=390.892s">Councilor</a>  Dela Ruzzo.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=391.773s">Councilor</a>  Dela Ruzzo, all in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=393.434s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=394.014s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=397.196s">17-645</a>  offered by Councilor Lococo. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=399.718s">Be</a>  it resolved that the city council be provided a copy of the report on enrollment and class size that was given to the school committee at the September 11, 2017 meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=408.444s">Councilor</a>  Lococo.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=412.19s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=414.791s">I</a>  believe since that resolution was put on two Fridays ago, last Tuesday we did receive a report from the superintendent with regards to enrollment and class size. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=427.414s">That</a>  report, I believe, was from September 7th. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=431.795s">I</a>  believe the numbers have increased some, but this too is along the lines of just making <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=439.428s">I</a>  don't have the resolution in front of me. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=440.709s">I</a>  think I had two very similar. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=444.17s">Yes,</a>  I was reading the committee minutes, or the, actually, I think it was the agenda, and I saw that this was on the agenda, so it's something that I always like to see in the fall, as well as when we have budget discussions in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=458.917s">So</a>  we were provided this, so I'll just move approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=462.019s">Anybody</a>  that wants to comment can comment on it, but it seems like all the numbers are <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=469.26s">close</a>  to if not what they were in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=472.002s">The</a>  one issue that I did speak up about was resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=477.506s">And</a>  I'm glad to see that we're able to keep our class sizes low. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=481.029s">And</a>  I hope we can continue that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=482.51s">Mr.</a>  President?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=483.711s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=484.571s">On</a>  this and related issues, I'd be eager to hear from the superintendent of schools and what he has to portend. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=492.678s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=493.598s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=494.799s">Roy</a>  Bellison, superintendent of schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=495.92s">schools,</a>  2500 Mystic Valley Parkway, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=501.066s">So</a>  I just want to comment a little bit that I think that the enrollment is good. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=506.152s">And</a>  I think that between you and the school committee, it supported the schools very well. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=511.758s">And</a>  I think we were able to maintain good class size. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=515.887s">I</a>  gave you an updated report tonight, which reflected another week into the school year, which is usually the first time there's a bump from the previous numbers that I was able to give you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=528.05s">In</a>  that period of time, there were 94 more new students that came into the public schools, 56 in the elementary, 27 in the middle, and 11 at the high school, Volkin and Curtis, a total of 94 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=539.972s">There's</a>  no significant change in class size. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=541.812s">There's</a>  no significant change in space availability and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=545.854s">The</a>  distribution of the new numbers, the Brooks had 21, the Columbus had 13, the McGuinn had 10, and the Roberts had 3 in regular classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=556.984s">Overall,</a>  the Brooks had 26, the Columbus had 13, the McGuinn Elementary had 10, and the Roberts had 7. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=565.552s">Now,</a>  overall, I think we're in good shape. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=569.833s">Obviously,</a>  I continuously watch things, pay attention, but it doesn't appear that the development that you're bringing into the city is actually having an impact on enrollment because of the nature of the units and because of the cost factors and other things involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=584.577s">We'll</a>  continue to track it and pay attention to it, but it doesn't look like it's doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=590.799s">The</a>  bigger issues for us are obviously the intensity of services that may be required. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=596.724s">Sometimes</a>  people come into the community with a tremendous need, and sometimes that's caused by the fact that the city provides really good services. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=605.271s">And</a>  I think that's something that, you know, it's a double-edged sword. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=608.193s">It's</a>  sort of like a <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=609.711s">you</a>  know, conundrum in the sense you want to provide the best services possible, you want to provide good special needs services, good ELL services, but the better you do, the more likely you are to attract people who are looking for good services and they may not get them in some other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=625.612s">Another</a>  factor that we've got to pay attention to a little bit is obviously transportation, because as we move people around, Medford provides 18 buses at free transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=635.617s">We</a>  also provide a lot of small vehicles to bring people around to different schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=640.079s">And</a>  when we moved the young people from the Roberts this year in EL classes to the Brooks, we created a little extra transportation cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=649.123s">So</a>  those are things we have to pay attention, take a look to. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=651.346s">We</a>  also want to see if we can't redirect some students over to the Columbus because that's the lowest enrollment right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=658.695s">But</a>  overall, we're in very good shape and we should continue to be in good shape and we'll continue to keep you updated. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=664.322s">I</a>  think that's, you know, it's important that you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=667.125s">It's</a>  also important that the public understands that development's going to be very important to the community because finances, whether you're talking about the federal government or the cutbacks coming through Washington, you're talking about the state government where there's continued a search for revenue, although September numbers look really good. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=684.053s">But</a>  I don't know if it's sustainable. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=685.994s">If</a>  we don't have development, we're not going to be able to sustain the level of services we want to provide to our young people, public safety or any other activity that you want to do because it appears to be that there's not a real appetite for other kinds of revenue around the state or in Washington. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=704.341s">Those</a>  are the big concerns and I think the development it can go hand in hand without impacting the schools But naturally we always pay attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=711.826s">So</a>  I appreciate you listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=712.927s">I'm</a>  happy to take any questions.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=737.86s">I</a>  don't see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=738.981s">At</a>  the McGlynn, if I look at the latest numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=740.882s">If</a>  you're looking at the actual number. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=742.723s">Oh,</a>  you're looking at the numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=743.743s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=743.903s">That's</a>  by choice of the principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=746.024s">Oh,</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=746.265s">Principal</a>  might, from time to time, decide that certain classes should be a little larger because the youngsters in it are doing well, and there may be another class that wants to cut it down a little bit because there's a youngster or two that may be more of a challenge.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=758.911s">I</a>  had an opportunity to, <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=761.252s">then</a>  the opening of the Modera today, which is 50% full right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=766.776s">And</a>  it's the other 20%, 25% is already under agreement once it opens. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=772.281s">And</a>  I asked them about children there and the two of the rental people didn't think there were any children at all in that building at the moment.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=781.227s">I</a>  just think it's not the kind of developments that are going to.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=784.893s">As</a>  I said, they couldn't recall anybody being there.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=787.554s">It's</a>  not the kind of developments that seem to be attracting young families that one, can afford it, and two, that might have sufficient space. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=793.617s">It</a>  seemed to be they were looking for other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=795.798s">So</a>  that's a factor that we need to keep in mind.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=800.199s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=801.56s">Councilor</a>  Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=802.141s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=803.842s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=805.063s">I</a>  just wanted to say, as a former member of the school committee, I know that, you know, class size has always been a huge focus with regard to just keeping it low, especially in the younger grades where you're really, you know, creating a sound foundation for education. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=822.397s">And</a>  when I look at these numbers, this is really remarkable. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=825.398s">To</a>  see this many classes that are in the high teens, 18, 19, 17, this is really remarkable. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=833.661s">And</a>  it's across the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=835.842s">I</a>  know when I was on the school committee, I'd go to the Massachusetts Association of School Committees Forum, where they had the organizational meeting every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=846.026s">And</a>  you talk to people from other school districts, and this is unheard of. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=849.427s">I</a>  mean, to have class size this low, <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=852.068s">absolutely</a>  unheard of so I mean congratulations to you and to the school committee for their fine work if you're staying on top of this because this is really remarkable to see class numbers this I know in my years of the school committee when we first came on I know that you know there were some classes you saw up around 25 26 27 and to see class size down at like 18 19 17 <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=878.444s">And</a>  I think in some instances, maybe even smaller. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=880.325s">There's</a>  one here at 15. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=881.045s">I</a>  mean, that's remarkable. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=883.546s">And</a>  it's great to see that, you know, there's a huge focus on class size and keeping it low. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=890.528s">And,</a>  you know, I just think, you know, this is remarkable. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=894.85s">And</a>  I just want to say great work to you and the school committee for making this a major priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=899.191s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=900.572s">Vice</a>  President Mox.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=901.732s">Go</a>  ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=902.993s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=904.645s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent, at what point is it a requirement that a teacher aid be put into a classroom?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=911.727s">There's</a>  no requirement for regular ed, except if you get into the elementary school up in the kindergarten, you'd have to be like 28, 29. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=921.09s">Is</a>  that a contractual requirement? <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=922.511s">That's</a>  a contractual requirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=923.771s">Actual</a>  class size typically is around, in the contract, 25 and up, in the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=931.209s">So</a>  there's no requirement for an aide until you get to like 29 in the elementary school system.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=936.851s">So</a>  how many teacher aides currently do we have in the school system?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=941.432s">Well,</a>  if you count special ed, we're pushing over 90. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=944.893s">If</a>  you're talking about kindergarten, there's 16 kindergartens and there's 16 aides now. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=953.656s">I</a>  believe, I'm gonna count them up, probably about 10 of them are full-time and the rest of them are not.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=961.45s">And</a>  out of the teachers that are listed on the sheet that we were given tonight, how many are paraprofessionals?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=967.313s">They're</a>  all teachers.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=968.573s">They're</a>  all teachers, so there's no paraprofessionals?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=971.035s">No</a>  paraprofessionals covering any classes.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=972.795s">And</a>  how many paraprofessionals do we have throughout the system?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=975.977s">As</a>  I indicated, most of them come from special ed, but I would say there's over 100 because ELL has some and some other areas have some.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=981.78s">So</a>  are you saying a teacher aid and a paraprofessional are one and the same?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=985.162s">Pretty</a>  much, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=986.142s">It</a>  just depends what they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=987.203s">So</a>  for example, you could have a person who's a tutor, you could have a person who's there assisting in a kindergarten classroom, you could have a person who's helping out in a special needs classroom on a one-to-one aid for a youngster who's physically disabled or has some other impairment.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1000.789s">And</a>  how many paraprofessionals are allowed under the contract? <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1004.871s">Do</a>  you know offhand?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1005.671s">There's</a>  no limit to what it's like. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1007.212s">It's</a>  really a need and budget related thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1009.333s">And</a>  you know, it really depends. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1010.934s">For</a>  example, today, you know, we talked about a particular student who has real needs and we added one. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1017.237s">I</a>  mean, just it's a matter of trying to determine what the need is and dealing with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1021.599s">And</a>  from time to time, I suggest to special ed and some of the others, is it necessary to keep an aide where they already are? <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1027.862s">Can</a>  we move somebody over? <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1028.922s">It's</a>  always a juggle because obviously everyone, once they get an aide, they want to keep it.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1036.107s">Mr.</a>  President, I want to thank the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1038.628s">I</a>  want to thank Councilor Lungo-Koehn for bringing this important issue up. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1044.253s">I</a>  think it's a sad commentary when you do hear that many of these developments that are coming into the community are not what I consider family friendly. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1056.422s">And</a>  you're right, there are very few families that are moving into these developments in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1062.168s">And</a>  because of affordability, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1065.471s">And</a>  secondly, that the target market is not families. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1070.396s">And</a>  I, as one member of the council, think as a community we have to do a better job in promoting this community as a family-friendly community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1081.426s">And</a>  I'd hate to see the very fabric of a community that I love and grew up in, uh, that had many families throughout the neighborhoods and around the community changed to one that, uh, families are not welcome anymore because they can't afford to live in this community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1097.261s">So,</a>  um, you know, when it comes time, when the city council looks at, <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1101.205s">zoning</a>  and other issues, I think that has to be a top priority that we remember that we want to invite everyone into the community, according to those that may be on the low-income bracket and according to those that may have families that can't afford to be into these high-priced developments, Mr. President, that are pricing families out of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1123.053s">So</a>  I just want to put that out there, Mr. President, and I thank the superintendent for his information tonight.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1130.618s">And</a>  thank you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1132.118s">I</a>  also want to thank the superintendent for the documents that he provided to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1135.699s">I'm</a>  glad I got a week to review them. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1138.44s">Just</a>  a couple questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1140.7s">With</a>  regards to the jump, I think it was eight days and we had an additional 94 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1146.801s">On</a>  any given year, how many do we see fluctuate during the month of September?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1152.362s">You</a>  might see another 50 students in the schools across the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1156.532s">at</a>  least the way it's normally the pattern is. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1160.074s">We</a>  started before September, we got pre-Labor Day, and that has an impact on some families. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1166.257s">Some</a>  families just want to take the extra days. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1168.618s">And</a>  some people don't get wound until they actually hit September. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1172.82s">So</a>  that first week is sort of that thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1175.561s">But</a>  the next week, according to the Parent Information Center, the movement into the schools this past week is not as heavy as it was the week before. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1183.624s">It's</a>  much lighter.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1185.425s">And</a>  then when will it stabilize? <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1187.046s">I</a>  mean, is there a normal?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1189.147s">The</a>  first big cut, a look at this thing is around October 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1192.909s">We</a>  take a look on October 1st, that's when we begin to file numbers with the state as to what our enrollment is. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1200.014s">And</a>  that drives Chapter 70 funding and other things of that type. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1203.135s">So</a>  we'd like to get a really good handle by October 1st because that tells us what funding we might be eligible for going forward.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1212.372s">If</a>  I could just request, based on either the parent information center or the school brains database, if we could just get an update, as well as the school committee, mid-October, just when things finally do stabilize so we can just get a more accurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1227.545s">accounting</a>  of the actual school year and how many children we will have in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1231.546s">I</a>  don't think it's going to change the numbers of class size. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1234.047s">I'm</a>  not worried about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1234.847s">I</a>  just want to have a baseline of where are we going. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1239.288s">I</a>  also think the information you provided to us, Councilor Marks is right. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1242.969s">I</a>  think you did a little research on the developments and it looked like out of a few developments there was only about 105 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1252.632s">That</a>  on the other end is whether there's too many children and we have this overcrowding issue or there's not enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1260.219s">This</a>  is going to show that the developments that are coming out, they're so expensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1264.582s">I</a>  mean, families cannot afford to live in them. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1268.125s">My</a>  concern, there has been a number of units that have come on. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1272.589s">We</a>  also have Medford Square that we need to make a decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1275.652s">Do</a>  we want to rezone Medford Square? <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1279.282s">what</a>  is gonna happen with Mystic Ave, you have the Locust Street, you have a number of additional units that are coming on, and I just think these are questions that need to be discussed, we need to have a handle on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1290.79s">We</a>  don't have, a couple schools have more space, but I know there are two schools that have somewhat of a space issue, and it's just something that I believe we have the right to ask questions about, and I'm very happy we have the answers to, and it's something <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1306.112s">we</a>  need to stay on top of. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1307.153s">We're</a>  the ones that are gonna decide the budget in June, and whether it's us or other councilors down the line, what is gonna happen in two years, three years, four years? <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1316.344s">So</a>  to have some of these answers I think is beneficial. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1319.988s">I</a>  don't know who discussed some of the answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1324.893s">if</a>  it was just the superintendent or if the school committee actually did discuss it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1328.754s">If</a>  necessary, they'll consider redistricting to shift enrollment to the Columbus. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1334.415s">This</a>  is just the start of the conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1337.035s">If</a>  in five years we have an extra 500 students than we do now, or even 300, where are we gonna go? <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1342.796s">What</a>  are we gonna do? <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1343.556s">How</a>  are we gonna space it out? <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1344.756s">How</a>  are we gonna make sure class size stays low? <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1347.577s">And</a>  I think with the group effort, we can do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1350.117s">And</a>  I just wanna make sure we are on top of it and planning accordingly.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1385.36s">Offered</a>  by Councilor Lennon, seconded by Councilor Layton. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1387.121s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1388.481s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1393.923s">17647,</a>  offered by Councilor Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1396.084s">Be</a>  it resolved that the school department provide the administration and the city council with numbers as it relates to how many children in rental units within the city attend the Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1408.768s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1410.169s">I</a>  think that also was discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1412.691s">We</a>  were given numbers of 105 from five or six different developments that are already station landing, Mystic Valley Parkway. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1420.876s">It</a>  looks like Mystic Valley Parkway has the most children. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1423.397s">River's</a>  Edge has less than I expected, but we did get the numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1428.421s">I</a>  really appreciate that and I hope that once we have newer developments on the books that we get an update, whether that be in the spring or <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1438.387s">even</a>  next fall, that we just keep track of it and know where we're going and where we're at.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1442.969s">I'm</a>  sure the superintendent will keep us apprised of that.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1446.271s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1447.712s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1448.772s">If</a>  I may. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1449.893s">The</a>  issue of affordable housing in our community is one that's of paramount importance at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1453.995s">I</a>  think Councilor Marks hit the nail on the head when he said that families are being priced out. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1458.157s">Families</a>  that have lived in this community for a long time that have helped make Medford the great place that it is to live now are being forced out. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1463.96s">They're</a>  being faced with an option as to <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1466.525s">You</a>  can't afford this, so what are you going to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1468.388s">And</a>  you're going to move. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1469.469s">And</a>  we're seeing that a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1471.992s">I'd</a>  like to amend the paper, Mr. President, and ask that our Office of Community Development and the Medford Housing Authority do an analysis in regards to Chapter 40R of the General Laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1480.641s">And</a>  Chapter 40R of the General Laws, Mr. President, relates to affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1485.026s">But</a>  it also provides a two-thirds reimbursement on the per pupil cost of students that live in those type of developments So if we're really serious about making a commitment to increasing the stock of affordable housing in our community And we have an opportunity to get a two-thirds reimbursement on our per pupil cost to educate these students I think it only makes sense that we examine that as we move forward So I'd like to amend the paper and request that our Office of Community Development and the Medford Housing Authority analyze the <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1509.483s">possibilities</a>  and potential of creating a Chapter 40-odd district, to increase the stock of affordable housing in our community, to make it family-friendly, and then to allow us an opportunity to capture some of the revenues from the state that will allow us to offset the cost of the per-pupil expense to educate a child by two-thirds, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1564.985s">I</a>  skipped over 646.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1566.666s">I</a>  skipped over 646? <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1569.288s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1569.948s">17,</a>  646 offered by Councilor O'Connor. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1571.409s">Be</a>  it resolved that the Medford City Council be apprised of the past, present, and future planning that has been and will be taking place to evaluate the increase in our student population as it is related to the space <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1583.745s">and</a>  needs within our schools, be it further resolved that if there has been no planning, the city creates a plan to make sure our schools are not overburdened within the next five, next year, five years and 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1597.272s">Councilman</a>  Locario.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1598.494s">I</a>  think that also, thank you President Caraviello, I think that also was discussed and there's a few lines that the superintendent gave us with regards to shifting and redistricting. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1609.064s">So</a>  I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1610.205s">I</a>  just, in the future, I hope that the school committee can really be involved and round table this and we can be involved as well with regards to planning down the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1620.055s">So</a>  I move approval.</p>

Penta, Zero Summit Road, River Mass, to address the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1645.448s">to</a>  discuss a review of the Home Rule petition to amend Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 44, Sections 16A and B, inclusive with a local legislative and legislative option provision as it relates to the Community Preservation Act and the Community Preservation Act Trust Funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1664.975s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1666.095s">Robert</a>  Penta, Zero Summit Road, Method Mass, former member of the Saugus party. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1671.557s">I</a>  present this to you, and I believe all of you got a copy of, that's a three page document that was mailed out early this summer, pursuant to the request of Council Wendell Curran to explain the rationale behind having a local option filing piece of legislation regarding <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1691.317s">Community</a>  Preservation Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1693.098s">When</a>  this Community Preservation Act was being sold to the folks here in the city of Medford, they were passing out pieces of literature such as this, talked about the Community Preservation Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1702.48s">And</a>  on the back it says, communities submit annual reports to the state before receiving matching funds to ensure funds are properly spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1712.303s">Matching</a>  funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1714.184s">In</a>  2002, which was the first year of the Community Preservation Act, <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1717.838s">For</a>  the first six years, cities and towns got 100% of their monies. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1722.723s">And</a>  at that point in time, there was 113 communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1726.646s">Now,</a>  in 2015, when the city of Medford voted for it, there's 156 communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1732.552s">And</a>  all we're getting back this year is approximately 14.5%. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1735.655s">And</a>  it's up to 178 communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1741.436s">The</a>  problem that's existing, speaking to these communities, and a lot of the folks, these legislators in these communities, are beginning to realize now that the tax, the CPA tax, the community preservation tax that people are paying for is not being matched by the Commonwealth of Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1758.159s">We</a>  voted for this in 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1760.801s">Its</a>  first year of payment is now coming to us in 2017, this November. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1766.246s">That's</a>  approximately $180,000, and we, the committee, collected $1.2 million, $500,000 of taxpayers' money. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1775.594s">The</a>  legislation that I'm proposing is not to abolish the CPA, but rather to make it fair and equitable <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1782.858s">for</a>  the folks who voted for it, and especially for the people of Medford who believed, when they voted for this, that the Commonwealth was going to match dollar for dollar through the trust fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1792.685s">And</a>  how it's being proposed right now is when you go to the Registry of Deeds, and whether it's a municipal lien or a tax on your real estate deeds, it's $10 or $20. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1800.651s">What</a>  they're thinking right now is doubling it, and that would constitute another tax on people who buy and sell property. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1809.497s">But</a>  putting that aside, until that happens, <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1812.06s">It</a>  was 2013 when it was then Governor DeVal Patrick who took $20 million, I believe, $25 million from the surplus money of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts just to meet the bare bones minimum of monies to go back to cities and towns in 2013. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1829.507s">it</a>  was approximately 52% of the monies went back to the cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1833.848s">We're</a>  down now to 14%. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1835.988s">And</a>  the law says the state cannot go any lower than 5%, which is sort of like outrageous because you're gonna keep taxing taxpayers in this community for something that's not being met. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1847.27s">People</a>  believed when they voted for the Community Preservation Act that the Commonwealth of Mass would match that dollar for dollar, it was advertised as such, and it was stated as such. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1857.485s">The</a>  two exceptions that I'm asking you folks to consider, and if you don't wanna vote on it tonight, that's all right, but I would appreciate it at least going to the city solicitor for the purposes of the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1867.927s">I'm</a>  asking that there be a hold on the city going further on collecting any monies from taxpayers under the CPA Community Preservation Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1877.248s">Because</a>  right now, it's not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1878.949s">You're</a>  telling the taxpayer that they have being taxed at 1.5% of their real estate value minus the first $100,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1887.685s">But</a>  at the same time, they're not gonna be getting that dollar amount from the trust fund, from the Commonwealth of Mass back. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1892.37s">That's</a>  number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1893.771s">Number</a>  two, the second part of the resolve is that this is a five-year commitment, as you know, and it automatically renews itself after five years, unless there's a legislative question on the ballot not to renew it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1906.679s">This</a>  second option is to have it go on the ballot automatically to renew it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1911.9s">So</a>  it dies, it's like sunset legislation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1914.281s">It</a>  just dies at the end of five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1916.621s">And</a>  if the community still wants to have it and they wanna go forward with it, they put it back on the ballot once again and the people can vote for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1923.663s">I</a>  don't think it's anything that's detrimental to this community other than the fact you're gonna keep taxing rate payers in this community for something they're not getting their money's worth for and they're not getting the match for. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1934.146s">And</a>  this greatly will impede <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1936.272s">This</a>  will greatly impede the concerns and the issues, whether it be for parks, historical pieces of property, low income housing, whatever the decision might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1946.001s">Plus</a>  the fact I believe that they're paying somebody approximately $65,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1948.143s">Mr.</a>  Pender, can I see that? <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1949.223s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1949.464s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1958.111s">I</a>  believe approximately right now somebody's getting paid, I believe if I understood when this came out a couple of months ago, somebody's gonna be paid approximately $65,000, $62,000, $149,000, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1966.26s">So</a>  we've collected $1,242,974 from the Medford taxpayers in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1968.062s">But</a>  all you're getting back from the Commonwealth of Mass is approximately $180,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1980.615s">That's</a>  not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1981.777s">That's</a>  not the way this was supposed to be going. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1983.839s">And</a>  now with more people coming on board, there's now 176 people applying for these monies from the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=1992.384s">and</a>  having to go to the registry of deeds to double increase the taxes for municipal liens and for deed stamps that goes on our recordings, that's not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2004.15s">Just</a>  to meet the bare bones minimum. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2007.151s">This</a>  year it's only 14%. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2008.472s">It</a>  was reported in the local press earlier this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2011.253s">You</a>  call the state house, they'll tell you the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2013.734s">And</a>  you call, for which I had a long extensive conversation with the people in Boston, it's called the CPA, <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2022.057s">in</a>  Boston, their research people. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2026.223s">This</a>  is not, this is not to say I or anyone opposed to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2031.75s">What</a>  I'm opposed to is the inequity that this is now presented here within our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2036.736s">And</a>  this inequity is not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2038.939s">Because</a>  people are believing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2041.105s">If</a>  you're only given $180,000 back on the $1.24 million, well, all we're asking to do is to put this on hold. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2048.928s">Medford</a>  taxpayers do not have to pay for this until such time that the Commonwealth meets its obligation for the purposes of giving the reimbursement. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2057.192s">That's</a>  what sold this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2059.032s">That's</a>  what people voted for. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2060.473s">And</a>  that's what they believed that they were getting, a match from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2064.075s">And</a>  unfortunately, it's not existing, and it's not there. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2067.92s">That</a>  should have been told, that should have been explained. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2069.661s">And</a>  I think, Mr. Clerk, you can attest to the fact over 1,200 people never turned their ballot over in 2015 to vote yes or no on the question itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2078.104s">So</a>  whether the people were not informed properly when they went to vote, or they just didn't want to vote, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2083.686s">But</a>  that's an awful lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2084.666s">And</a>  I just think it takes into the serious consideration of today, hard times, people, water connectivity fee, water and sewer taxes, your tax rate keeps going up. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2096.006s">new</a>  police station, new fire station, a library. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2099.948s">Where</a>  is this money coming from? <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2101.489s">And</a>  it's the most unfair way to go out and tax somebody right now on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2106.071s">This</a>  is a state issue for which people went on <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2109.331s">I</a>  believe that this would be one way to at least mitigate until the Commonwealth of Mass gets its act together, either they're going to give the 100% back or they're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2118.442s">Why</a>  should you deal with the idea that we'll, we guarantee 5% because that's what the law says? <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2122.887s">Well,</a>  what's 5%? <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2123.828s">That's</a>  meaningless. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2125.69s">That</a>  is stupid. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2127.512s">I'm</a>  more than happy to answer any questions.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2132.197s">If</a>  I could, I called the CPA on some of the questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2138.278s">The</a>  answer that I was given that says there is nothing in the CPA law nor on any state website or on our website, nor in your local CPA ballot language that says that the state match will be 100%. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2151.521s">In</a>  fact, all sources on the CPA are very clear on how the match works on the percentages from previous years.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2159.19s">With</a>  all due respect, Rick, I have a folder here, and if you want to, I'll go over it with you, okay?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2164.152s">I'll</a>  go over it with you.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2165.312s">This</a>  first came across the city council in 1991, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2170.154s">And</a>  in 1991, when this came out, when it became part of its first proposal, I think the then-Method City Council <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2176.276s">did</a>  not want to entertain it at the time because they felt it was another tax on the people, unfairly hitting them without having a say. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2183.903s">And</a>  you only can put it in those four particular areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2186.345s">Right</a>  now, okay, the people voted for it, we accept that, I got no problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2190.289s">But</a>  how do you continue to go forward and tax the people when you're not even getting the money back? <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2194.593s">You're</a>  not even getting 50% of it back, you're only getting 14.5% of the money back. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2197.075s">It's</a>  totally unfair. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2201.599s">And</a>  if you go to these other cities and towns and you talk to them like I have, a lot of them are not realizing it until you go in there and you start reading the information that they have there and how it's broken down. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2211.204s">And</a>  I got volumes on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2213.125s">I</a>  don't sit home and read this for my health. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2215.005s">I'm</a>  concerned about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2216.246s">I</a>  think it's an end run on Proposition 2.5 if you continue to tax the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2221.142s">at</a>  the way you're going. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2222.583s">This</a>  is an alternative. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2224.364s">It's</a>  a legitimate alternative that a city and town can pose, and until such time. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2229.507s">And</a>  this is only good for five years, remember that, because the first year that you voted for was 15 to 16, and you had to get those numbers together, so you're not getting that money until 17. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2238.812s">So</a>  the city of Medford is only gonna get it for four of the five years on the CPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2243.034s">And</a>  then if it goes automatically after that, it'll be every year on and after that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2246.796s">But</a>  what I'm saying is at the end of the fifth year, Rick, <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2250.413s">the</a>  option would be that it ends, it becomes part of sunset legislation, and if the community wants to do it again, they put it on the ballot like they did the first time, and the people can vote it up or they can vote it down.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2265.64s">Questions?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2268.001s">Motion</a>  to receive and place on file, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2269.542s">Mr.</a>  President, I, go ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2271.985s">Mr.</a>  President, if I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2274.088s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2276.57s">I</a>  agree with a lot of comments that Councilor Penter has made up there at the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2283.718s">When</a>  I talked to our own state delegation, many of them said that the program itself was a victim of its own success. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2292.408s">When</a>  it originally started out, the match was much larger based on the number of communities that participated. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2300.091s">And</a>  over time when communities found out that this may be workable in their community, they got added and the pool of money got lesser and lesser and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2309.695s">I</a>  personally would like to see an organized target of our state delegation and the state legislature to say, why you created this program, we didn't create the program, <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2321.88s">This</a>  was created by the state legislature. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2324.122s">Why</a>  are you not matching the fund? <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2327.445s">Well,</a>  why are you not providing a decent match? <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2330.048s">Even</a>  if it's not 100%, maybe 80, 75, 60%. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2330.809s">But</a>  to go down to, as the council mentioned, <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2338.335s">14.5%</a>  and if new communities are joining, it's going to be a point, at some point, unless the state legislature acts, that there won't be a match at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2348.864s">And</a>  I think people would have to revisit the issue again, because I vote with the will of the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2355.309s">The</a>  people voted for this, and we have it in the community, and as far as I'm concerned, we have to work with it and move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2361.754s">That</a>  doesn't prevent us from a legislative body in the community, and I would offer that tonight to send to our state delegation that we ask that the CPA fund be fully funded based on the need and the amount of communities that are anticipating into this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2382.928s">So</a>  I would offer that tonight, Mr. President, that that be one approach that we send a letter as the Medford City Council.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2390.593s">And</a>  that was the suggestion from the head of the CPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2393.955s">CPA</a>  was to change state law chapter 44B as applies to all cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2402.021s">And</a>  they suggest that the petitioner submit their idea to the state delegation.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2410.106s">That's</a>  what I'm asking here. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2411.367s">Motion</a>  to sever the papers, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2413.368s">Mr.</a>  President, what are the motions before us?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2420.725s">It's</a>  just a petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2422.685s">Just</a>  a petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2423.806s">What</a>  petition? <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2424.766s">It's</a>  not a motion.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2426.586s">Because</a>  only a member of this body can make a motion, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2429.447s">That's</a>  correct.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2430.027s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2430.747s">But</a>  it's a petition, and it was the suggestion by the gentleman from the CPA.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2437.129s">Mr.</a>  Chase, I believe.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2438.089s">Yeah,</a>  no, I talked to Stewart. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2440.69s">He</a>  was the head of an agency. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2442.33s">Yeah,</a>  and he said that was the route to go through the state delegation.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2446.291s">You</a>  could go through the state delegation, but you also could go through your local legislative body. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2450.64s">That's</a>  why I said a local home will petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2452.663s">I'd</a>  like to make one correction. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2453.665s">I</a>  said 1991. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2454.287s">It</a>  was 2001 when this first came up in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2458.461s">And</a>  from 2001, 2002, which was the first year, to 2007, the first six years, 100% went back to cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2467.528s">But</a>  they started off at 34, and then they went to 113 cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2472.071s">The</a>  next year, from 2008 going forward, you went from 127, now up to 176, and it's been downhill ever since. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2479.917s">And</a>  again, we're just looking at equity, something that's fair to the Medford taxpayer, <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2486.636s">especially</a>  the one that doesn't realize they're not getting it, that the state is not matching the money, as they said, and that's the term that they used. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2493.659s">Their</a>  own booklet, when they sent it out, way back when, it broke down all the cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2498.641s">And</a>  like I said, I would just be asking respectfully that the council either forward this to the city solicitor and ask him if this could be done, and if not, then we go to the second row, asking our state legislation.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2512.926s">If</a>  one of the councilors wants to make that motion?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2517.514s">If</a>  the gentleman could just clarify if what can be done, I know he spelled it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2521.277s">According</a>  to- If I could just finish. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2525.06s">I</a>  know he mentioned by putting a hold on any collecting of monies in the community and also that the five year commitment, once that ends, that they go back on the ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2536.109s">Are</a>  those the two?</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2538.91s">Things</a>  that you want us to present to the city solicitor asking Right in the letter it designates both sections of the law section to amend section 16 a and section 16 B of the sections 4 to 7 sections 3 to 7 of chapter 44 which this city accepted when they voted for the for the act in 2015</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2559.803s">But</a>  the question to the city solicitor would be the legality of us.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2563.064s">The</a>  legality of the law or if he would prepare legally a home rule petition that could be forwarded to our state legislators for the purposes of, again, this is not repealing it or getting rid of it, just to amend what's there until such time that the Commonwealth <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2582.745s">figures</a>  out how to give us the 100% back.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2584.366s">Right,</a>  but you're also asking us to hold off on collections of any money.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2588.369s">That's</a>  part of.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2589.63s">Right,</a>  right, and honestly at this point I don't feel comfortable.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2592.873s">No,</a>  no, that's part of the proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2595.054s">Not</a>  now, not doing it right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2597.777s">Filing</a>  the piece of legislation that would allow cities and towns through their local legislative body to hold back collecting until 100% and then the second part would be if this were to be accepted and voted upon.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2610.36s">Councilor</a>  De La Rosa. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2611.241s">Mr.</a>  President, a number of people in our community put great efforts into proposing and working on this Community Preservation Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2623.095s">Under</a>  my aegis as president, Council Knight was appointed to lead a task force in developing <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2630.863s">implementation</a>  program and ordinance with the assistance of the consultation of the city solicitor and the primary people involved in the leadership of this effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2647.312s">Mr.</a>  President, none of them are here to consult us on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2653.915s">None</a>  of them are here to advise us. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2656.416s">Quite</a>  frankly, I am <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2661.584s">have</a>  an expectation of expertise from them on these matters and questions, and they're not here to present to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2670.907s">They've</a>  been duly appointed by this body, actually, to act as experts and leaders <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2677.89s">in</a>  matters regarding the Community Preservation Act in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2683.473s">And</a>  in fact, they're meeting tonight at the Department of Public Works Conference Room. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2689.537s">Mr.</a>  President, at this time, the only action I'm able to take, given our lack of input on this matter, and the matter of timing of removing from the table of this matter, is to receive and place on file or to return it to the table.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2707.328s">If</a>  you'll allow me to read the advice given to me by the head of the CPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2713.155s">It</a>  says, the petitioner is seeking to change the state law chapter 44B. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2717.762s">And</a>  have the change apply to all cities and towns who adopt the CPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2722.604s">That's</a>  incorrect. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2723.725s">Let</a>  me finish. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2725.005s">This</a>  is not what a home rule petition does. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2727.486s">According</a>  to the Massachusetts Municipal Associate, a home rule petition is the process by which individual localities may petition state legislation affecting only the locality. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2741.112s">In</a>  fact, same article states that localities lack home rule power to regulate areas outside of <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2747.372s">municipalities</a>  geographic limits. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2749.954s">If</a>  the petitioner seeks to change the state law, they should submit their idea for legislation to the state representative center. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2756.397s">All</a>  citizens have the right to ask legislators to file legislation, so that is the proper way for this person should put his idea before the state legislator. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2766.403s">No</a>  city council action is required for a citizen to ask the legislator, <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2771.463s">to</a>  file legislation to amend the state law. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2774.025s">Since</a>  this is not a home petition, and since there is no action required by the city council, it may be appropriate to take the following action when you reach this item on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2784.493s">One,</a>  I explained the procedure to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2787.635s">Two,</a>  we can rule this out of order. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2791.648s">Yeah,</a>  so it just plays on file because what you're requesting doesn't involve the city council, it involves the state legislator.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2798.991s">If</a>  you read the last sentence of my paragraph, the intent of this home rule, local option petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2804.432s">It's</a>  a local option petition filed if the city of Medford feels that they would like to go forward as a local option petition for which the people would have a chance to vote on it, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2815.816s">If</a>  they don't have that option, <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2817.497s">than</a>  the local option, then we would take it to the legislature and have them file it for whatever the purposes might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2823.124s">I'm</a>  presenting it because I really think it's sort of like unfair to tax these people, to tax our citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2828.772s">I</a>  said in 2013, $25 million was taken out of the surplus. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2835.39s">In</a>  2014, $11.4 million was taken out of the state surplus. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2840.093s">And</a>  in 2015, $10 million was taken out of the state surplus. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2843.034s">From</a>  2016 forward, there's been no surplus and no money to be taken out, and all that's happening is people are being taxed. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2850.078s">Unfairly</a>  being taxed for something that they're not getting their money back on. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2853.94s">It's</a>  like you going to the store and buying a new suit, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2858.762s">And</a>  they said it's $199, you go there, it's $300 because they didn't tell you about all the other incidentals. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2864.125s">It's</a>  not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2865.126s">All</a>  we're asking for is equity, fairness to this whole thing, and having an opportunity just to present it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2870.768s">Again,</a>  this is not to kill it, to squash it or anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2873.41s">It's</a>  just to bring equity until such time that the Commonwealth can prove, can prove. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2877.612s">Councilor</a>  Marks, you just said it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2879.653s">You</a>  spoke to someone up there and they said they created something, they can't control it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2884.395s">It's</a>  a monster that's out of control. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2886.196s">But</a>  unfortunately, the rate payers, the taxpayers are paying for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2889.818s">And</a>  that's not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2890.638s">I</a>  don't believe that that is fair.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2894.392s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2895.114s">Oh,</a>  it's so late. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2895.816s">The</a>  ballot question passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2899.927s">Citizens</a>  in this community have spoken. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2902.449s">uh,</a>  the city council met, created an ad hoc committee on the implementation of the community preservation act. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2908.534s">Um,</a>  we crafted a very strong ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2910.415s">We</a>  drafted a very strong ordinance, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2913.017s">And</a>  just in recent months, this community preservation committee has been appointed and they're finally up and running and they're doing a really good job. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2920.602s">And</a>  there are a very group of dedicated individuals that are really committed to the success of this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2926.046s">And</a>  I don't think we need to take steps as a council to undermine the efforts in the work that they're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2930.55s">Mr.</a>  President, <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2931.957s">I</a>  certainly support asking the state delegation to fully fund the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2935.138s">I</a>  certainly support asking the state delegation to fully fund the CPA match. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2938.64s">I</a>  think that's a no-brainer, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2940.1s">We</a>  all want more money. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2941.221s">We</a>  all want more free money to come into our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2942.942s">There's</a>  no doubt about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2944.762s">But</a>  right now, we have an opportunity to build upon the successes of the work that we put in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2948.804s">It's</a>  a grassroots effort and a grassroots campaign that came and brought the Community Preservation Act to our table, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2953.766s">It's</a>  something that was supported by the voters, that was passed by the voters. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2956.787s">I'm</a>  not one that's going to stand in the way of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2958.812s">But</a>  ultimately, if we listen to the conversations that we've had here at the city council meetings, affordable housing is a topic that we've talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2965.613s">I'm</a>  pretty sure Councilor Scott Peli has talked about recreation in the past quite a bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2969.914s">I</a>  know Councilor Longo-Curran has talked about historic preservation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2972.215s">These</a>  are three priorities of this council, three things that we've been very, very focused on, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2976.316s">And</a>  there are three things that the CPA directly provides for. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2979.217s">So</a>  whether or not the match is 1%, 100%, 14.5%, I don't think we need to stand in the way of the success of our CPC. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2985.779s">I</a>  think what we need to do is take a step back and let them do some of their work and let them see what the fruits of their labor is going to bear. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=2991.38s">So,</a>  I for one, Mr. President, would support receiving this paper and placing it on file, supporting a B paper to ask our state delegation to fully fund the Community Preservation Act.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3001.008s">That</a>  was my motion, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3003.711s">The</a>  B paper is my motion.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3004.932s">Yeah,</a>  I'd absolutely support that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3006.293s">I'd</a>  absolutely support that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3007.154s">I'd</a>  second that.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3008.034s">So,</a>  is Councilor Knight saying it's okay to tax the people without getting the adjustment? <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3012.298s">redemption</a>  for why they voted for this?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3014.599s">I</a>  think that's what he said. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3025.792s">the</a>  people that are appointed to do their job, do their job, and be successful at it, and not stand in the way of it, and not interfere and impede the work that they're trying to do.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3033.46s">Is</a>  Councilor Knight alleging that I'm spewing false information, and that my statistics are wrong, that we're only getting 14%, okay, 14.55%?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3039.366s">I</a>  don't think Councilor Knight is saying that.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3042.73s">Well,</a>  I think you go back and listen to what he said. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3045.319s">Why</a>  don't you go back and listen to it? <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3051.343s">I</a>  just can't believe that a board would want to continuously tax people in this room, in this community, knowing that it's wrong because the Commonwealth is not at least meeting its obligation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3063.791s">They</a>  can't even get to 50%, never mind 15%. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3067.833s">It's</a>  just wrong.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3069.334s">Again,</a>  as was stated to me by the CPA, there was never anything in the law that says this will be matched at 100%.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3075.997s">Rick,</a>  it's right there on the back of the card. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3078.978s">It</a>  says matching funds.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3079.879s">What's</a>  matching funds? <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3080.499s">It</a>  says matching funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3081.56s">It</a>  doesn't say at what percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3084.601s">And</a>  I can give you- Read the history. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3086.862s">I'm</a>  going to give you a right from the CPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3090.684s">There's</a>  nothing here that says 100%. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3093.559s">It's</a>  in its original documents. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3095.64s">If</a>  you have something that says 100%, please show it to me and I will be happy to submit that to the CPA.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3102.705s">I</a>  think when this was voted in, and you can correct me if I'm wrong, <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3107.113s">Mr.</a>  Penta, I believe it was 18% when this was voted in. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3112.939s">And</a>  I don't believe, that was going to be my question to you, what does the card say? <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3117.383s">Because</a>  when I had discussions with those advocating for the CPA, I was aware it was 18%. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3121.728s">I</a>  think the bigger issue, if you're going to fight for or against it, it would be <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3126.532s">Did</a>  people know was on the back of the ballot and if not then yeah, I mean I knew it wasn't it wasn't hundred percent It was 18 and percent.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3132.974s">I</a>  believe 2015 we vote it was 29 percent I think it went down to 18 now. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3135.635s">It's</a>  14 Maybe that's where it comes when it was just talking about the information whether or not what was on the card and</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3152.078s">So</a>  on the motion by- Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3157.083s">Vice</a>  President Max. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3159.886s">I'm</a>  sorry, would you like to yield the- would you like to yield the floor to the people behind you?</p>

    <p>[Joyce Paul]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3169.264s">Name</a>  an address of the record, please A couple of things that I've heard tonight are that the people voted for this and I have some disagreement with that the people I talked to didn't vote for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3185.336s">They</a>  didn't have any understanding of what was going on and I think I'm pretty much out there and <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3191.412s">And</a>  I would be embarrassed to admit that I didn't understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3196.417s">So</a>  for people who voted for it, they maybe did understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3201.681s">Maybe</a>  they're the people who end up with jobs and they think this is a good thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3206.926s">But</a>  for people, I would say the average person, when you look at how few people actually did vote for it, not many people did, including me, who thinks that I know what I'm doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3219.485s">So</a>  I also am very concerned about talk about affordable housing and bringing more people in and traffic and more people in the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3232.949s">And</a>  if you're going around anywhere around Wellington, it's like a nightmare. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3239.55s">And</a>  when Wegmans comes in, it's going to be much worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3245.373s">And</a>  the casino. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3248.014s">And</a>  I have spoken to a few people in Boston who, because I said 1.5%, where's our 1.5%? <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3255.318s">And</a>  they said, very seriously, the state doesn't have the money and the state can't send it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3265.403s">And</a>  it's nothing to do with we don't like Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3268.225s">We</a>  simply don't have the money and we're simply not going to send the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3272.91s">So</a>  I think it's quite reasonable to say we're not going to get the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3277.894s">They</a>  can't send the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3279.475s">We're</a>  only going to get a little bit of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3282.145s">And</a>  I agree with Mr. Penta that you're taxing, I think, a few people who voted for this, and most people who didn't vote for this, and they're not very happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3294.476s">I</a>  don't know exactly what the statistics are, who voted and who didn't vote, but I think most people didn't vote for it, and they're not very happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3303.805s">I</a>  mean, Democrat, Republican, Independent, people don't like taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3308.469s">And</a>  then when you talk more taxes, oh my God. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3313.413s">So</a>  I think there are things we need to do, but everybody I know is very concerned about the police station, the fire station, the library, and the roads and sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3328.564s">I've</a>  been into the senior center and the seniors are always the sidewalks, the sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3333.908s">And</a>  when you're spending money on all these things, <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3337.392s">I</a>  mean, people just can't do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3339.133s">They</a>  really just can't do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3340.854s">They're</a>  very, very unhappy. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3344.456s">So</a>  I support what Mr. Prince has said. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3346.917s">I</a>  think it's a reasonable solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3349.718s">Now,</a>  one other thing, which is a totally different subject. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3353.08s">I</a>  was trying to figure out where to go tonight, and I knew Tuesday was city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3358.523s">So</a>  I called the mayor, and yes, this is city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3361.544s">There's</a>  also a zoning meeting, <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3364.17s">And</a>  there's also a meeting at Hanes about money. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3367.954s">And</a>  then on the website is the CPA at the DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3373.585s">and</a>  I know somebody who was gonna go there but is gonna go here, then now I called the mayor's office and they said that one isn't going to be, so I don't know whether it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3383.013s">But</a>  I'm good, but I can't be in four places at once. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3385.995s">And</a>  I can't also be in three places at once. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3388.917s">And</a>  I don't feel like the mayor really cares about me. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3392.28s">But</a>  you guys have power. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3394.502s">And</a>  I was thinking you could send a little email to the mayor and say, you know, if Tuesday night is gonna be city council, <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3401.632s">then</a>  let's not have another meeting on Tuesday night. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3404.934s">I</a>  think that would be a reasonable thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3407.797s">And</a>  that's it for me, unless you have any questions.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3414.101s">Citizen</a>  Castagnetti wishes to address.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3416.103s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3417.664s">Andrew</a>  Castagnetti, 23 Cushman Street, former Medford City Council candidate. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3425.709s">The</a>  lady brought up a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3428.552s">City</a>  has a scheduling problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3431.501s">We</a>  cannot be in more than one location at one time. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3436.244s">I</a>  wanted to go to something about Haines Square.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3439.727s">We</a>  are on the CPA.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3440.888s">It</a>  would be nice to have meetings separate. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3443.109s">We're</a>  on the CPA though. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3443.749s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3444.45s">If</a>  you want to speak about scheduling, come back later in the evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3447.852s">I'm</a>  just talking about scratch one. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3449.894s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3450.114s">We're</a>  doing CPA first. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3451.735s">Okay,</a>  about the CPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3454.451s">My</a>  comprehension of past facts on the CPA vote, number one, in effect, it's an override of proposition two and a half. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3463.618s">Number</a>  two, I believe approximately 5,555 people voted for the mayor in the past election, and about 5,000 voted for the runner-up. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3478.15s">It</a>  came out to about 10,500. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3483.051s">but</a>  approximately only 8,000 voted for the CPA tax, including renters were allowed, approximately, including the renters were allowed to vote for it, Mr. Finn. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3501.867s">And</a>  it was passed by a narrow margin, I believe.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3506.991s">Mr.</a>  Finn, do you have the margin that it passed by? <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3510.834s">Can</a>  you recall? <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3514.714s">56%</a>  to 44%.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3515.575s">Okay,</a>  so there's a narrow margin in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3524.742s">Number</a>  three, why did they only require approximately 1,700 signatures to get the CPA question on the ballot? <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3539.558s">But</a>  we, the average people or person, we need 20% of the registered voters, which is about approximately 7,000 signatures to get something on the ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3555.484s">And</a>  also, I believe some people were involved with grabbing the petitions, worked for City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3563.787s">A</a>  director of a certain department I noticed was involved.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3566.828s">We</a>  can't speak for that.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3568.101s">I'm</a>  not sure if that was legal. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3570.141s">Do</a>  not be quiet about that right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3574.902s">Number</a>  four, however, I'm not very upset at the extra $60 a year for my real estate tax bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3582.144s">I'm</a>  more concerned I'm three real estate tax bills in arrears at the tune of $4,500 plus fine, plus 14% per annum juice interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3595.027s">Because</a>  some of us are struggling to pay our bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3598.26s">Number</a>  five, also I'm most concerned where most of this money will be spent, meaning outside of the West Medford area, we have South Medford, East Medford, Fulton Heights, and I believe these other areas have greater need to improve our quality of life, period. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3622.38s">And</a>  finally, number six, <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3624.413s">And</a>  of course, the so-called matching state funds was and is a fallacy, period, again. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3631.256s">Thank</a>  you, if you're listening.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3634.617s">Point</a>  of personal. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3636.498s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3637.558s">I</a>  just wanna thank the last speaker for his regular reference to East Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3643.961s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3645.861s">The</a>  letter that you wrote from the gentleman from the CPA incorrectly states that this was a petition to apply to all cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3651.844s">It</a>  was not. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3653.269s">And</a>  that basically... That's what he wrote back to me.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3656.17s">That's</a>  what he wrote? <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3656.631s">That's</a>  what he wrote.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3657.151s">Apparently</a>  you didn't translate it properly, or you didn't understand it properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3660.072s">I</a>  kind of transparent what you said to me to make sure that I... But apparently it was wrong because I don't want anyone to be misled to think that I'm asking this for all cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3668.757s">It</a>  was just for the city of Medford, a local community home rule petition option.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3677.061s">On</a>  the motion by Vice President Marks, <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3681.813s">I'm</a>  sorry, did you want to speak?</p>

    <p>[uIlyuj9UctU_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3683.816s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3685.478s">My</a>  name is Carolyn Jones. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3688.401s">I</a>  try to come to- Can we have your address, please? <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3692.065s">32</a>  Arlington Street in West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3694.067s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3696.11s">I</a>  try to come to some of the meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3698.452s">My</a>  health hasn't been that great, so I can't always get to all of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3702.809s">But</a>  I'm concerned about the increase in taxes, about the emphasis on the changes in Medford from the few meetings that I've been to. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3713.818s">The</a>  emphasis seems to be on younger people. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3720.044s">rather</a>  than the entire community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3723.326s">And</a>  I'd like to see something that happens when, where you can have more people who come out to the city council meetings, that there's more information that's in the transcript so that people know that when they come to a meeting, they know what's gonna occur at the meeting, they know what's happened in the past, and they can be, or feel more readily <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3746.002s">able</a>  to express their opinions. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3748.545s">I</a>  don't have that problem because I express my opinions all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3753.231s">But</a>  I think that what needs to happen is that the information needs to be more direct when it comes out to <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3766.005s">the</a>  residents of Medford, that there's not just a little card that comes out, but there is something, whether it's in the transcript, whether it's in the mercury, something on a weekly basis that can be an outline of what's going on, whether it's an increase in taxes, and encourage the people who live in West Medford and pay for taxes in West Medford to feel free to come to these meetings, to talk to all of you, <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3794.482s">to</a>  let you know what our feelings are. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3796.263s">I</a>  mean, I'm one of the people who doesn't like to see my taxes go up, and that's just because I am retired now, and so I have a fixed income. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3807.708s">And</a>  I don't like to go into my extra money unless I absolutely have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3811.79s">I</a>  guess I got kind of stingy when I got older about <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3815.68s">how</a>  I was going to spend my money. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3817.941s">But</a>  I just think that I would like to see something that encourages more people in the community to come out to these meetings and for more people in the community to really have some good information when they come to the meetings so that they can ask reasonable questions and hope to get reasonable answers from those of you who are on city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3841.653s">That's</a>  all I have to say.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3842.533s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3845.02s">On</a>  the motion by Vice President Mox, Mr. Clerk, if you could read that motion back.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3851.064s">It</a>  was a letter to the state delegation on fully funding the match on the CPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3862.971s">Is</a>  that correct?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3864.712s">That's</a>  correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3865.112s">That's</a>  the B paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3866.193s">That's</a>  the B paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3868.374s">And</a>  the A paper? <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3871.56s">is</a>  the petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3873.362s">To</a>  be received and placed on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3874.783s">To</a>  be received and placed on file.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3878.347s">So</a>  there's no appetite here to send this to the city solicitor for the purposes of reviewing? <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3883.071s">So</a>  what we're saying is just keep taxing the people.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3886.835s">If</a>  someone wants, if somebody wants to make the motion to do that.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3890.278s">Well</a>  would you do it Mr. President?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3892.22s">I'm,</a>  Mr. President, you have six other councilors here. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3894.742s">That's</a>  a good question Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3899.345s">I</a>  would be amendable to send this to a subcommittee where we can invite members of the CPA committee where we can invite the city solicitor and we can have a discussion and dialogue around the suggestions made by the petitioner so I have no problem in discussing any issue that comes before us <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3919.736s">Council,</a>  Mr. President, so I would make a recommendation that this be sent to the, which is the best committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3928.367s">Economic</a>  development?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3932.312s">Legislative.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3934.315s">I</a>  think we have a legislative committee, don't we?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3936.873s">Whatever</a>  committee, it doesn't matter to me as long as the committee gets together and meets on the issue.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=3942.917s">I'll</a>  let you do a committee of the whole, Mr. Vice President.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=4075.567s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=4076.968s">In</a>  front of the stretch of homes between Rice and Willard along Willis Avenue on the odd numbered side, <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=4083.111s">You'll</a>  see that it's very difficult for one vehicle to get by when cars are parked on each side of the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=4087.396s">In</a>  the audience today, we do have a homeowner that lives along that stretch who's contacted me and asked that we move this matter forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=4094.183s">Ultimately,</a>  the residents at 195-197 Willis Ave had a yellow painting in front of the curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=4103.396s">connotating</a>  that no parking was supposed to occur there. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=4105.738s">And</a>  over time, that paint wore off. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=4108.04s">I</a>  reached out and contacted the Traffic Commission in consultation with Councilor Marksley, who's been working on this with me, and we spoke with the members of the Traffic Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=4115.027s">The</a>  Traffic Commission went down and took a look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=4116.709s">The</a>  DPW painted a certain stretch of the curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=4119.451s">However,</a>  they weren't able to paint the curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=4121.587s">the</a>  entire length of Willis between Rice and Willard. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=4124.869s">And</a>  they also were under the impression that even though the curb was yellow, if people parked there, the police weren't gonna do anything about it so that the appropriate steps that needed to be taken in order to address this public safety concern would be to put a no parking sign up. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=4136.217s">However,</a>  the archaic and arcane way that we do signage in the city of Medford means that the individual homeowners who was aggrieved by this public safety concern is now asked to get a petition and go knock on doors and ask their neighbors to sign a petition <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=4151.444s">to</a>  address this public safety issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=4152.865s">And</a>  I don't think that that's right, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=4154.667s">I</a>  think that clearly there's a need, clearly there's a public safety concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=4159.429s">and</a>  I put this resolution forward to request that the Traffic Commission take the appropriate steps to put the parking restrictions in place so that the individuals that reside on the stretch of roadway can feel safe and comfortable and know that if a fire engine or an ambulance is called to their home, that the fire engine or the ambulance can make it down the street to get to their home to bring them the life-saving care that they need, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=4178.675s">So</a>  it's a very simple and basic resolution, and it's really cut out of the cloth for the interest of public safety and emergency preparedness.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=4528.673s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=4530.635s">With</a>  the implementation of awakements coming in, you're going to see more and more people walking to the new shopping center. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=4540.182s">And</a>  if anyone's been over to that area, you can see that it's very dark at night and the sidewalks are kind of beat up and the trees are hanging. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=4549.469s">So</a>  it's my recommendation that we contact our state delegation, Senator Jalen and <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=4556.734s">Representative</a>  Barber to have the DCI go over there, inspect the sidewalk, and look at the feasibility of maybe putting a couple of street lights in there to help out, let's say, the people that are going to be walking to the supermarket. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=4570.998s">It</a>  is dark there, and you'll be having people from the other moving in, walking over also. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=4576.619s">So</a>  if we could have some lights, and hopefully looking at the sidewalk and trimming the trees, so make it be a little easier for them to walk there. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=4588.384s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=4602.637s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=4604.599s">17-655</a>  offered by Councilor Luebel-Kern. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=4608.127s">We</a>  have resolved that the city looks into working with a group like Team Better Block to engage in temporary scenarios in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=4615.07s">The</a>  MAPC is currently working with 101 communities, and it would be nice to also work with a company that focuses solely on Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=4623.635s">Councilor,</a>  let go current.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=4624.815s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=4626.736s">In</a>  other cities and towns, they use different companies such as <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=4631.31s">Team</a>  Better Block, which was brought to my attention and I did some research on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=4635.974s">It's</a>  a way, in addition to what the MAPC has been doing for Medford Square and has done for Medford Square, what Team Better Block, I know that the new developments <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=4648.746s">Developed</a>  area at Union Square has used that company team better block and I know there are other companies So I just want to ask the administration if that's something that we've looked into or if not if we can look into it team better block is a company that comes in and they focus 100% of their energy on Medford and they do they would do <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=4670.703s">like</a>  they've done in other cities and towns across the United States, they would do temporary scenarios, so wouldn't necessarily, and they would engage the public and the community, figure out ways to include almost along the same lines of what we're trying to include, public space, public art, bump-outs, temporary crosswalks, but this is almost on a temporary basis, so we can not only get input and take surveys of what <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=4699.84s">the</a>  city of Medford wants and what our residents want, but you would, they create bump outs and crosswalks, all different types of public spaces, public green space as a temporary fix to see how it works. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=4716.415s">and</a>  they would do it in all different areas, obviously different areas within Medford Square, and if it worked, obviously you can go to South Medford and West Medford, just to engage the public in ways that aren't so permanent, where people get an idea of, oh wow, if we did do these bumbouts, they're not as scary as they seemed, or not as drastic as they seemed when it was gonna be a permanent thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=4742.845s">Let</a>  people understand the ideas that the CDC has come up with, and Team Better Block obviously comes up with additional ideas and additional ways to make it happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=4752.816s">I</a>  know they did a project, I believe, on the west coast, and it cost a couple thousand dollars to do a large section of a city square. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=4763.987s">on</a>  a temporary basis, and the life it created, and the community that it created, I think would be beneficial. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=4770.489s">They</a>  would focus 100% on Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=4772.669s">I'm</a>  not sure of the cost, that's one thing that I just didn't research yet, but to actually do the temporary scenarios is very inexpensive, and it's somebody that would focus just on Medford, just on Medford Square, where we do need the revitalization, where people do want <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=4789.614s">Do</a>  you want to see change they want to see more activity more green space more? <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=4793.86s">Public</a>  art more open space and we're going there It's just we can't afford everything all at once and this would be a way to say these are the five things that we can try out see if they work and <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=4806.938s">And</a>  then if it is working and we are able to get the community involved and happy about these different scenarios, we can make it happen as a permanent, you know, a permanent fix, a permanent change. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=4818.106s">So</a>  it's just one idea that has come, was brought to my attention and I think, I don't think see any harm in doing some research on it and seeing if we can look into hiring some sort of company to do this type of work for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=4832.196s">Mr.</a>  President?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=4834.468s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=4835.508s">This</a>  idea was presented at the meeting we had on the master plan unveiling a couple weeks ago and I know that this was presented as an option from some citizens and that the mayor was aware of this and is eager to look into this and equally energetic about this matter and these options as the <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=4863.081s">Director</a>  of our Community Development Office, Lauren. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=4869.886s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=4870.566s">Through</a>  the chair, if we could request just an update with regards to what has been done to hire or research companies like Team Better Block and what our plan is going forward, just so we can have an awareness. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=4883.135s">I</a>  mean, I've only researched the one company for an hour on the internet, watched a bunch of videos and seen actually what work they've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=4892.382s">And</a>  there's a lot more than obviously other companies. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=4895.143s">But</a>  what has the city administration done to use more than MAPC that is working with over 100 other communities? <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=4902.387s">I</a>  mean, somebody to focus just on Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=4904.648s">A</a>  public meeting is great on a Wednesday night, but to have <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=4909.25s">people</a>  somebody that will survey and get the community involved and active and it is a community team better buck uses the computer community to create these spaces and if we could get that done, I think it would be Beneficial to the you know in to use it going forward and all our squares is going to be beneficial to the city of Medford so approval that we get an update on where we're at if we've started researching that and if we're gonna move forward with such an option I</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5180.951s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5183.592s">I</a>  think this is something that, this issue of the development is something that everybody seems to be talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5192.073s">So</a>  many people have different opinions where development should go, how much, how little, not go certain places, more here, more there. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5202.355s">And</a>  we don't really have a committee made up of residents to discuss the issues and to get the feedback from the entire community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5211.666s">And</a>  I think that's almost necessary, whether it be one committee or it be task force for each specific area. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5219.975s">It</a>  was requested that there also be <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5223.979s">which</a>  I'm going to amend the paper, there'd be a Mystic Ave task force made up of residents who want to see development in Mystic Ave and want to have input and voice their concerns and ask questions and be able to <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5239.327s">figure</a>  out what the community wants down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5242.449s">And</a>  I think that's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5243.45s">I</a>  think that's something that's been lacking with regards to some of the projects that have moved forward over the last several years. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5250.875s">No</a>  community input. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5252.036s">It</a>  goes on the Zoning Board of Appeals agenda and gets approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5256.755s">I</a>  think Canal Street is the only one that I know that did not get approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5260.177s">But</a>  we need more community input. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5262.798s">And</a>  I think this is the way to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5265.54s">I</a>  think the committee, hopefully the mayor, would be willing to set up a <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5270.625s">a</a>  task force or a development committee made up of Medford residents from all different areas, and I'd like to amend the paper to ask that a Mystic Ave task force be put in place made up of South Medford residents and business owners who work on Mystic Ave, because that's coming down the line, and we want to make sure we're prepared for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5293.03s">I</a>  think this is something that's long overdue, and I believe the council, whether we have a council rep on the committee, if this isn't moved forward, I think it's best to be organized by the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5306.682s">If</a>  it's not moved forward by the administration, then I think the council has to create a committee within our own body to <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5316.109s">be</a>  able to discuss development in subcommittee and get the community involved as much as we can and get input. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5322.373s">It's</a>  hard when you're trying to see everything that's being written everywhere and try to get <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5328.801s">Try</a>  to form your opinions on where development should go and how much of it when you don't have sit-down meetings to discuss it I think that's what's what's missing For me as one Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5340.808s">I'm</a>  not against development, but if a neighborhood like near the mall didn't want 500 units that you know our votes and our <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5351.053s">requests</a>  and our concerns stem from what the neighborhoods want and things are moving so quickly I think we need to be on top of it and a development committee to discuss development in general and then also different task force one specifically for Mystic Ave is what we need.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5370.371s">Oh,</a>  Scott Belly. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5371.672s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5372.572s">I</a>  thank my colleague for bringing this motion forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5376.655s">I</a>  think the mayor has done a very good job of getting constituents involved with different task force. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5385.46s">I</a>  can attest to that with the recreation committee that worked so hard to see that through fruition. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5391.103s">And</a>  I think that with so many questions and issues we have with development and so many educated <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5400.344s">people</a>  in our community that if you went to the development hearing and you listened about the revitalization of Medford Square and the ideas from the different constituents, I think that would be a welcome attribute that <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5416.015s">that</a>  we should be using here in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5418.236s">So</a>  I think that I would second my fellow councilor's resolution, and I would hope the mayor's office will support that for the fact that a lot of the great things that are happening have come about with different task forces and committees that she started back in her beginning of her term. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5441.528s">So</a>  I thank you for bringing that up.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5444.803s">Councilor</a>  Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5445.584s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5446.484s">I</a>  thank the council for bringing this resolution forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5448.946s">It's</a>  a resolution that I support and I do believe that there are many qualified professional people, you know, with professional backgrounds in different, you know, in development and traffic engineering and whatnot throughout our community that can really help out. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5463.758s">with</a>  regard to the future development in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5466.261s">And</a>  who knows better than the people that actually live in that neighborhood on a daily basis what works and what doesn't work. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5472.927s">So</a>  I think it's always important to reach out to the neighborhoods and get their input. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5477.151s">And</a>  I think this is a great way of doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5478.832s">So</a>  this is a resolution that I do support. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5481.455s">I</a>  think having people <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5483.837s">You</a>  know in the neighborhoods that are active that want to be involved that want to help shape the future of their communities important and their input Should definitely be heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5491.859s">So</a>  I support the resolution as well.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5593.048s">The</a>  blue light says we have a police guy there.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5594.909s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5595.329s">So,</a>  I mean, what we're doing here and getting the speed monitor signs and working, Sergeant Hartnett has been great to get <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5604.355s">some,</a>  you know, the speed reduced on some of our streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5607.459s">South</a>  Street, when I went to the Traffic Commission meeting a couple weeks ago, this was brought up, requested, and it was something that I believe the Chief of Police was on board with. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5617.913s">It's</a>  just a matter of getting the Department of Public Works to put <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5620.777s">down</a>  a big graphic, the graphic that shows that there's a crosswalk coming up ahead, which it's only a few feet before the crosswalk, but it's just a little extra. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5630.067s">There</a>  are hundreds of people, like I said, I think a couple weeks ago, that cross south to Walnut because it's the gateway to the square leading into Colleen's ice cream shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5640.503s">when</a>  you cross that bridge right into the heart of Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5643.185s">So</a>  if we could get a graphic put on by the DPW, it would be greatly appreciated. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5648.79s">I</a>  think it's one of the many measures that are going on on South Street to help with the speeding and to help pedestrian safety.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5658.344s">Mr.</a>  President, I agree with this measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5661.025s">I,</a>  however, believe that that is the new standard for any repairs that are done in the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5667.847s">And</a>  where that intersection is being, the corner of Winthrop and South Street is being renovated at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5676.67s">I</a>  believe that any significant renovations must end with the cross scoring that's applied into the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5685.533s">as</a>  well as the new style of access ramps on the sidewalks with the hobnails in the ramp on the pad and other measures the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5696.859s">We</a>  can see this demonstrated most clearly with the work that's been done at the intersections of College Avenue and Boston Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5707.845s">So</a>  I agree with this and second approval.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5908.138s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5909.9s">I</a>  know DPW is diligently working on <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5913.003s">the</a>  painting of many of our crosswalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5915.286s">However,</a>  Highland Ave, I know, is a state road, and I would ask that our DPW reach out to the state to get the state on top of painting the crosswalks, Mr. President, in the interest of public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5930.443s">Also,</a>  Mr. President, if I could, I had the opportunity this past Saturday, there was a young gentleman in our community who was going for his Eagle Scout badge. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5940.931s">His</a>  name is John Fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5943.213s">And</a>  the project he selected, which I thought was a pretty unique project to assist this community, was to erect 100 hydrant markers. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5954.781s">to</a>  alert the fire department and also residents in a time when snow gets heavy where fire hydrants are located and John fee reached out to the vocational school the vocational students bent up the wrought iron cut the cut it for John John and his scouts painted them and <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5975.532s">And</a>  this past Saturday, with the thanks of Mr. Tanaglia in DPW and Mr. Krueger in the Water Department, they went out and erected 100 of these. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5986.181s">And</a>  I can tell you, they're going to last forever, these particular hydroponics, and it's a great community project. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=5994.167s">And</a>  something that I know I've spoken about a number of times, and it's great to see someone in the community step forward and make such a positive change on behalf of the residents, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=6008.198s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=6009.358s">If</a>  I can amend that, if we can invite him here to receive a citation in the near future?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=6015.563s">As</a>  soon as he gets his Eagle Scout badge. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=6018.065s">This</a>  was a step in the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=6020.407s">He</a>  will be invited, and I appreciate that.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=6060.688s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=6061.909s">I</a>  had the opportunity this weekend to go along with a lot of my colleagues to go to the Mystic River Celebration. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=6069.19s">And</a>  while I was there, I was going to some of the different tables and, you know, just, you know, getting more information, talking to people and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=6076.692s">And</a>  they went to the Method Farmers Market table and just asked them because I think this is their first year in the new locations down at the Condon Shell. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=6083.814s">And</a>  they said so far it's been really, really good. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=6085.834s">They've</a>  had a lot of great activity, a lot of people walking down on Thursday afternoons to <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=6090.155s">just</a>  buy some local produce and whatnot, and just ask them a little bit about the new location. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=6096.399s">And</a>  they said it's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=6098.1s">They</a>  said the challenge now is it's towards the end of the season, so the sun goes down a little bit sooner, and the market goes until 7 PM. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=6106.324s">So</a>  that last hour, it's getting dark, basically. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=6111.387s">And</a>  so it's tough for people to walk around, and it's also tough for the vendors to clean up after the market closes down. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=6119.992s">So,</a>  you know, in the matter of public in the, you know, matter of public safety, it'd be nice if we could have the mayor's office of the electric department, see what they can do to have the lights activated for at least the last hour of the farmers market on Thursday afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=6134.584s">So</a>  it would probably be, it'd be nice if they could activate them from probably anytime after five to at least <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=6139.988s">I'm</a>  guessing maybe 7.30 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=6142.329s">So</a>  it's safe down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=6144.309s">It</a>  should be well lit. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=6145.93s">And</a>  it's a great venue to have really any type of local city function. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=6153.952s">So</a>  it's in the matter of public safety, if we could afford that to the mayor's office of the electrical department, I'd greatly appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=6159.774s">Second.</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=6229.214s">I</a>  was there. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=6231.555s">I've</a>  looked. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=6232.035s">It</a>  looks like it's <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=6234.509s">It's</a>  close, I would think maybe next week, hopefully will be the last week that we'll be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=6239.593s">But</a>  if we can get a more definite- I will try my hardest to, I've tried to get an answer from the people working in there and I couldn't get a definitive answer from them. <a href="https://youtu.be/3rLlhNFiQKU&t=6248.94s">Maybe</a>  the administration- I will talk to the administration.</p>
