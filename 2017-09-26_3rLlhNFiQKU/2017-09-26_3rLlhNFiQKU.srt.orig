[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

28
00:01:06,697 --> 00:01:08,258
[SPEAKER_04]: What are we taking off the table?

29
00:01:08,278 --> 00:01:10,439
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, the paper that I refer to would be 176454647.

30
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:10,539
[SPEAKER_04]: And 44? 44454647?

31
00:01:20,818 --> 00:01:25,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, do you have the minutes, Mr. Clark, from last week?

32
00:01:27,843 --> 00:01:28,363
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can read it?

33
00:01:28,704 --> 00:01:34,668
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Scapelli, can I see the book?

34
00:01:34,688 --> 00:01:36,790
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President, if I may present these to you.

35
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:38,631
[SPEAKER_04]: I would appreciate it, Councilor Tarullo, sir.

36
00:01:53,284 --> 00:01:57,333
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

37
00:01:57,353 --> 00:02:00,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, 17644 offered by Council Member Kern.

38
00:02:00,741 --> 00:02:13,551
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council be appraised of the past, present, and future planning that has been and will be taking place to evaluate the increase in residential units and the impact it is having on our public safety personnel.

39
00:02:14,112 --> 00:02:26,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it further resolved that if there is a plan to increase our public safety personnel numbers and locations to accommodate the increase in population, it be provided to the Memphis City Council

40
00:02:27,801 --> 00:02:31,604
[SPEAKER_04]: If there is no plan, be it resolved that one be put in place.

41
00:02:31,684 --> 00:02:32,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Lungo-Kern.

42
00:02:33,005 --> 00:02:34,687
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, President Carviello.

43
00:02:34,727 --> 00:02:44,795
[SPEAKER_10]: This is one of the three or four that I put on last week, and I think I have two additional resolutions on this week that relate to the development in Medford.

44
00:02:44,815 --> 00:02:54,783
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to get some answers and see if the discussion has been started, and if not, get the discussion started, get the

45
00:02:55,592 --> 00:03:03,498
[SPEAKER_10]: conversations started with regards to anything and everything that development in the community could be impacted by.

46
00:03:03,518 --> 00:03:07,401
[SPEAKER_10]: And one of those areas is our public safety.

47
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:11,905
[SPEAKER_10]: We all know that our numbers are stable but low.

48
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:15,708
[SPEAKER_10]: We're able to provide services as best we can.

49
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:19,330
[SPEAKER_10]: We see the police and fire and DPW do all that they can.

50
00:03:20,071 --> 00:03:21,072
[SPEAKER_10]: But when you talk to

51
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:29,295
[SPEAKER_10]: a firefighter or a police officer, they do have questions with regards to when are levels going to be increased.

52
00:03:29,795 --> 00:03:38,141
[SPEAKER_10]: We seem to always be hiring additional personnel, but it almost seems like we're just filling retirement positions.

53
00:03:39,181 --> 00:03:42,504
[SPEAKER_10]: And it seems like with the development that potentially

54
00:03:43,965 --> 00:04:09,977
[SPEAKER_10]: has been approved or development that is potentially going to be approved in certain areas within our city that are gonna be developed, I think we need to get a round table discussion if it hasn't happened already with the chief of police, the chief of fire, DPW commissioner, personnel in the mayor's department, the city council and the community and figure out what may be needed.

55
00:04:10,577 --> 00:04:12,818
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I've heard that there's a ladder truck

56
00:04:13,642 --> 00:04:15,372
[SPEAKER_10]: out of service as of this week.

57
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:23,332
[SPEAKER_10]: definitely heard rumblings that certain stations are not active with regards to the fire department.

58
00:04:23,912 --> 00:04:28,834
[SPEAKER_10]: You always hear that public safety and the police department is understaffed and that we need more personnel.

59
00:04:30,075 --> 00:04:39,179
[SPEAKER_10]: So what are we gonna do if we're gonna have 500 units plus at potentially multiple areas in this city?

60
00:04:39,339 --> 00:04:43,481
[SPEAKER_10]: Are we going to expand and open more stations?

61
00:04:43,581 --> 00:04:45,622
[SPEAKER_10]: Are we gonna try to increase our numbers

62
00:04:46,315 --> 00:04:49,457
[SPEAKER_10]: police and fire and DPW so we can handle the load.

63
00:04:50,317 --> 00:04:53,939
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is just one area that needs to just be discussed.

64
00:04:54,739 --> 00:05:01,522
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that it's come to light other areas and people are starting the conversation, but I feel like we all need to be on board.

65
00:05:01,582 --> 00:05:13,168
[SPEAKER_10]: We need to be privy to how we're going to handle it and make sure it's handled accordingly so that we can keep our residents current and future residents safe within our community.

66
00:05:13,858 --> 00:05:14,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor.

67
00:05:15,019 --> 00:05:15,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Del Rosso.

68
00:05:16,161 --> 00:05:17,102
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

69
00:05:17,142 --> 00:05:22,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Longo-Kurt for this wonderful resolution.

70
00:05:22,688 --> 00:05:27,494
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd be particularly curious as to see where our population is.

71
00:05:27,594 --> 00:05:28,695
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it actually growing?

72
00:05:29,456 --> 00:05:41,958
[SPEAKER_06]: or is the development just reflecting a spread in population and a diminishment in people per domicile?

73
00:05:42,438 --> 00:05:55,741
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd also like to see how our present current public safety numbers and our other city service numbers as far as employees delivering services to the city, police, fire, DPW,

74
00:05:57,561 --> 00:06:13,646
[SPEAKER_06]: reflects what we are now as a community of 56,000 as a comparison to when we were a community, I think, at our height in the 60s, 70s was 65, 68,000, I believe.

75
00:06:14,087 --> 00:06:19,969
[SPEAKER_06]: So that would be a worthwhile consideration when we have this conversation, Mr. President.

76
00:06:20,369 --> 00:06:20,669
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

77
00:06:23,627 --> 00:06:29,371
[SPEAKER_04]: On motion by Councilor Lococo to send this to the mayor for her action.

78
00:06:30,152 --> 00:06:30,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Seconded by?

79
00:06:30,892 --> 00:06:31,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Dela Ruzzo.

80
00:06:31,773 --> 00:06:33,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Dela Ruzzo, all in favor?

81
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:33,874
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

82
00:06:34,014 --> 00:06:37,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

83
00:06:37,196 --> 00:06:39,358
[SPEAKER_04]: 17-645 offered by Councilor Lococo.

84
00:06:39,718 --> 00:06:48,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it resolved that the city council be provided a copy of the report on enrollment and class size that was given to the school committee at the September 11, 2017 meeting.

85
00:06:48,444 --> 00:06:49,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Lococo.

86
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:54,651
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, President Carviello.

87
00:06:54,791 --> 00:07:07,394
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe since that resolution was put on two Fridays ago, last Tuesday we did receive a report from the superintendent with regards to enrollment and class size.

88
00:07:07,414 --> 00:07:10,974
[SPEAKER_10]: That report, I believe, was from September 7th.

89
00:07:11,795 --> 00:07:17,336
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe the numbers have increased some, but this too is along the lines of just making

90
00:07:19,428 --> 00:07:20,669
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have the resolution in front of me.

91
00:07:20,709 --> 00:07:22,590
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I had two very similar.

92
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:38,857
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I was reading the committee minutes, or the, actually, I think it was the agenda, and I saw that this was on the agenda, so it's something that I always like to see in the fall, as well as when we have budget discussions in June.

93
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:41,118
[SPEAKER_10]: So we were provided this, so I'll just move approval.

94
00:07:42,019 --> 00:07:47,942
[SPEAKER_10]: Anybody that wants to comment can comment on it, but it seems like all the numbers are

95
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,442
[SPEAKER_10]: close to if not what they were in June.

96
00:07:52,002 --> 00:07:56,886
[SPEAKER_10]: The one issue that I did speak up about was resolved.

97
00:07:57,506 --> 00:08:00,989
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm glad to see that we're able to keep our class sizes low.

98
00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:02,290
[SPEAKER_10]: And I hope we can continue that.

99
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:03,110
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President?

100
00:08:03,711 --> 00:08:04,411
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Del Rosso.

101
00:08:04,571 --> 00:08:12,477
[SPEAKER_06]: On this and related issues, I'd be eager to hear from the superintendent of schools and what he has to portend.

102
00:08:12,678 --> 00:08:13,018
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

103
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:14,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Name and address of the record, please.

104
00:08:14,799 --> 00:08:15,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Roy Bellison, superintendent of schools.

105
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:20,145
[SPEAKER_02]: schools, 2500 Mystic Valley Parkway, Massachusetts.

106
00:08:21,066 --> 00:08:25,411
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want to comment a little bit that I think that the enrollment is good.

107
00:08:26,152 --> 00:08:30,737
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that between you and the school committee, it supported the schools very well.

108
00:08:31,758 --> 00:08:34,081
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we were able to maintain good class size.

109
00:08:35,887 --> 00:08:47,229
[SPEAKER_02]: I gave you an updated report tonight, which reflected another week into the school year, which is usually the first time there's a bump from the previous numbers that I was able to give you.

110
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:59,032
[SPEAKER_02]: In that period of time, there were 94 more new students that came into the public schools, 56 in the elementary, 27 in the middle, and 11 at the high school, Volkin and Curtis, a total of 94 students.

111
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:01,792
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no significant change in class size.

112
00:09:01,812 --> 00:09:04,833
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no significant change in space availability and the like.

113
00:09:05,854 --> 00:09:16,504
[SPEAKER_02]: The distribution of the new numbers, the Brooks had 21, the Columbus had 13, the McGuinn had 10, and the Roberts had 3 in regular classes.

114
00:09:16,984 --> 00:09:24,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Overall, the Brooks had 26, the Columbus had 13, the McGuinn Elementary had 10, and the Roberts had 7.

115
00:09:25,552 --> 00:09:28,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, overall, I think we're in good shape.

116
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:44,017
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, I continuously watch things, pay attention, but it doesn't appear that the development that you're bringing into the city is actually having an impact on enrollment because of the nature of the units and because of the cost factors and other things involved.

117
00:09:44,577 --> 00:09:49,139
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll continue to track it and pay attention to it, but it doesn't look like it's doing that.

118
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:55,783
[SPEAKER_02]: The bigger issues for us are obviously the intensity of services that may be required.

119
00:09:56,724 --> 00:10:04,210
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes people come into the community with a tremendous need, and sometimes that's caused by the fact that the city provides really good services.

120
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:08,153
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's something that, you know, it's a double-edged sword.

121
00:10:08,193 --> 00:10:08,934
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sort of like a

122
00:10:09,711 --> 00:10:24,811
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, conundrum in the sense you want to provide the best services possible, you want to provide good special needs services, good ELL services, but the better you do, the more likely you are to attract people who are looking for good services and they may not get them in some other communities.

123
00:10:25,612 --> 00:10:35,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Another factor that we've got to pay attention to a little bit is obviously transportation, because as we move people around, Medford provides 18 buses at free transportation.

124
00:10:35,617 --> 00:10:39,559
[SPEAKER_02]: We also provide a lot of small vehicles to bring people around to different schools.

125
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:48,563
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we moved the young people from the Roberts this year in EL classes to the Brooks, we created a little extra transportation cost.

126
00:10:49,123 --> 00:10:51,306
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are things we have to pay attention, take a look to.

127
00:10:51,346 --> 00:10:57,954
[SPEAKER_02]: We also want to see if we can't redirect some students over to the Columbus because that's the lowest enrollment right now.

128
00:10:58,695 --> 00:11:04,282
[SPEAKER_02]: But overall, we're in very good shape and we should continue to be in good shape and we'll continue to keep you updated.

129
00:11:04,322 --> 00:11:06,344
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's, you know, it's important that you know.

130
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:23,513
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also important that the public understands that development's going to be very important to the community because finances, whether you're talking about the federal government or the cutbacks coming through Washington, you're talking about the state government where there's continued a search for revenue, although September numbers look really good.

131
00:11:24,053 --> 00:11:25,193
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know if it's sustainable.

132
00:11:25,994 --> 00:11:42,920
[SPEAKER_02]: If we don't have development, we're not going to be able to sustain the level of services we want to provide to our young people, public safety or any other activity that you want to do because it appears to be that there's not a real appetite for other kinds of revenue around the state or in Washington.

133
00:11:44,341 --> 00:11:51,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the big concerns and I think the development it can go hand in hand without impacting the schools But naturally we always pay attention.

134
00:11:51,826 --> 00:11:52,887
[SPEAKER_02]: So I appreciate you listening.

135
00:11:52,927 --> 00:11:54,008
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy to take any questions.

136
00:11:54,228 --> 00:11:57,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President I don't think it's 23 there, but I'll take a look.

137
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:00,572
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think any classes that I I

138
00:12:11,757 --> 00:12:12,778
[SPEAKER_02]: 21.5 at the McGlynn.

139
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:16,840
[SPEAKER_04]: But the biggest class in the city is 23 at the McGlynn in the fifth grade?

140
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:18,461
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see that.

141
00:12:18,981 --> 00:12:20,862
[SPEAKER_02]: At the McGlynn, if I look at the latest numbers.

142
00:12:20,882 --> 00:12:22,323
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're looking at the actual number.

143
00:12:22,723 --> 00:12:23,603
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you're looking at the numbers.

144
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:23,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

145
00:12:23,903 --> 00:12:25,844
[SPEAKER_02]: That's by choice of the principal.

146
00:12:26,024 --> 00:12:26,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

147
00:12:26,265 --> 00:12:38,031
[SPEAKER_02]: Principal might, from time to time, decide that certain classes should be a little larger because the youngsters in it are doing well, and there may be another class that wants to cut it down a little bit because there's a youngster or two that may be more of a challenge.

148
00:12:38,911 --> 00:12:40,012
[SPEAKER_04]: I had an opportunity to,

149
00:12:41,252 --> 00:12:45,876
[SPEAKER_04]: then the opening of the Modera today, which is 50% full right now.

150
00:12:46,776 --> 00:12:52,160
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's the other 20%, 25% is already under agreement once it opens.

151
00:12:52,281 --> 00:13:00,327
[SPEAKER_04]: And I asked them about children there and the two of the rental people didn't think there were any children at all in that building at the moment.

152
00:13:01,227 --> 00:13:04,270
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think it's not the kind of developments that are going to.

153
00:13:04,893 --> 00:13:07,514
[SPEAKER_04]: As I said, they couldn't recall anybody being there.

154
00:13:07,554 --> 00:13:13,577
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the kind of developments that seem to be attracting young families that one, can afford it, and two, that might have sufficient space.

155
00:13:13,617 --> 00:13:15,178
[SPEAKER_02]: It seemed to be they were looking for other things.

156
00:13:15,798 --> 00:13:19,020
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a factor that we need to keep in mind.

157
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:20,679
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President.

158
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,101
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Falco.

159
00:13:22,141 --> 00:13:22,861
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

160
00:13:23,842 --> 00:13:24,843
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. Superintendent.

161
00:13:25,063 --> 00:13:41,697
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to say, as a former member of the school committee, I know that, you know, class size has always been a huge focus with regard to just keeping it low, especially in the younger grades where you're really, you know, creating a sound foundation for education.

162
00:13:42,397 --> 00:13:45,358
[SPEAKER_09]: And when I look at these numbers, this is really remarkable.

163
00:13:45,398 --> 00:13:53,581
[SPEAKER_09]: To see this many classes that are in the high teens, 18, 19, 17, this is really remarkable.

164
00:13:53,661 --> 00:13:55,302
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's across the district.

165
00:13:55,842 --> 00:14:06,006
[SPEAKER_09]: I know when I was on the school committee, I'd go to the Massachusetts Association of School Committees Forum, where they had the organizational meeting every year.

166
00:14:06,026 --> 00:14:09,087
[SPEAKER_09]: And you talk to people from other school districts, and this is unheard of.

167
00:14:09,427 --> 00:14:11,068
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, to have class size this low,

168
00:14:12,068 --> 00:14:32,160
[SPEAKER_09]: absolutely unheard of so I mean congratulations to you and to the school committee for their fine work if you're staying on top of this because this is really remarkable to see class numbers this I know in my years of the school committee when we first came on I know that you know there were some classes you saw up around 25 26 27 and to see class size down at like 18 19 17

169
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:40,305
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think in some instances, maybe even smaller.

170
00:14:40,325 --> 00:14:40,925
[SPEAKER_09]: There's one here at 15.

171
00:14:41,045 --> 00:14:43,186
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that's remarkable.

172
00:14:43,546 --> 00:14:50,308
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's great to see that, you know, there's a huge focus on class size and keeping it low.

173
00:14:50,528 --> 00:14:54,810
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, I just think, you know, this is remarkable.

174
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:59,011
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just want to say great work to you and the school committee for making this a major priority.

175
00:14:59,191 --> 00:14:59,531
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

176
00:15:00,572 --> 00:15:01,312
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Mox.

177
00:15:01,732 --> 00:15:02,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead.

178
00:15:02,993 --> 00:15:03,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

179
00:15:04,645 --> 00:15:10,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Superintendent, at what point is it a requirement that a teacher aid be put into a classroom?

180
00:15:11,727 --> 00:15:19,990
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no requirement for regular ed, except if you get into the elementary school up in the kindergarten, you'd have to be like 28, 29.

181
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:22,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a contractual requirement?

182
00:15:22,511 --> 00:15:23,431
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a contractual requirement.

183
00:15:23,771 --> 00:15:29,213
[SPEAKER_02]: Actual class size typically is around, in the contract, 25 and up, in the contract.

184
00:15:31,209 --> 00:15:36,271
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's no requirement for an aide until you get to like 29 in the elementary school system.

185
00:15:36,851 --> 00:15:40,212
[SPEAKER_03]: So how many teacher aides currently do we have in the school system?

186
00:15:41,432 --> 00:15:44,093
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if you count special ed, we're pushing over 90.

187
00:15:44,893 --> 00:15:52,896
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're talking about kindergarten, there's 16 kindergartens and there's 16 aides now.

188
00:15:53,656 --> 00:15:59,658
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe, I'm gonna count them up, probably about 10 of them are full-time and the rest of them are not.

189
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:06,913
[SPEAKER_03]: And out of the teachers that are listed on the sheet that we were given tonight, how many are paraprofessionals?

190
00:16:07,313 --> 00:16:08,553
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all teachers.

191
00:16:08,573 --> 00:16:11,015
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all teachers, so there's no paraprofessionals?

192
00:16:11,035 --> 00:16:12,575
[SPEAKER_02]: No paraprofessionals covering any classes.

193
00:16:12,795 --> 00:16:15,096
[SPEAKER_03]: And how many paraprofessionals do we have throughout the system?

194
00:16:15,977 --> 00:16:21,439
[SPEAKER_02]: As I indicated, most of them come from special ed, but I would say there's over 100 because ELL has some and some other areas have some.

195
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,621
[SPEAKER_03]: So are you saying a teacher aid and a paraprofessional are one and the same?

196
00:16:25,162 --> 00:16:25,702
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much, yeah.

197
00:16:26,142 --> 00:16:27,102
[SPEAKER_02]: It just depends what they do.

198
00:16:27,203 --> 00:16:39,748
[SPEAKER_02]: So for example, you could have a person who's a tutor, you could have a person who's there assisting in a kindergarten classroom, you could have a person who's helping out in a special needs classroom on a one-to-one aid for a youngster who's physically disabled or has some other impairment.

199
00:16:40,789 --> 00:16:44,431
[SPEAKER_03]: And how many paraprofessionals are allowed under the contract?

200
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:45,391
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know offhand?

201
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,192
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no limit to what it's like.

202
00:16:47,212 --> 00:16:49,313
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really a need and budget related thing.

203
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:50,293
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, it really depends.

204
00:16:50,934 --> 00:16:56,576
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, today, you know, we talked about a particular student who has real needs and we added one.

205
00:16:57,237 --> 00:17:01,539
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, just it's a matter of trying to determine what the need is and dealing with it.

206
00:17:01,599 --> 00:17:07,802
[SPEAKER_02]: And from time to time, I suggest to special ed and some of the others, is it necessary to keep an aide where they already are?

207
00:17:07,862 --> 00:17:08,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we move somebody over?

208
00:17:08,922 --> 00:17:14,005
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always a juggle because obviously everyone, once they get an aide, they want to keep it.

209
00:17:16,107 --> 00:17:18,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, I want to thank the superintendent.

210
00:17:18,628 --> 00:17:22,431
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to thank Councilor Longo-Kern for bringing this important issue up.

211
00:17:24,253 --> 00:17:35,542
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a sad commentary when you do hear that many of these developments that are coming into the community are not what I consider family friendly.

212
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:41,427
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're right, there are very few families that are moving into these developments in the community.

213
00:17:42,168 --> 00:17:44,710
[SPEAKER_03]: And because of affordability, number one.

214
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:49,515
[SPEAKER_03]: And secondly, that the target market is not families.

215
00:17:50,396 --> 00:18:00,746
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, as one member of the council, think as a community we have to do a better job in promoting this community as a family-friendly community.

216
00:18:01,426 --> 00:18:17,221
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd hate to see the very fabric of a community that I love and grew up in, uh, that had many families throughout the neighborhoods and around the community changed to one that, uh, families are not welcome anymore because they can't afford to live in this community, Mr. President.

217
00:18:17,261 --> 00:18:20,785
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, you know, when it comes time, when the city council looks at,

218
00:18:21,205 --> 00:18:42,612
[SPEAKER_03]: zoning and other issues, I think that has to be a top priority that we remember that we want to invite everyone into the community, according to those that may be on the low-income bracket and according to those that may have families that can't afford to be into these high-priced developments, Mr. President, that are pricing families out of our community.

219
00:18:43,053 --> 00:18:48,574
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just want to put that out there, Mr. President, and I thank the superintendent for his information tonight.

220
00:18:50,618 --> 00:18:52,018
[SPEAKER_10]: And thank you, President Carviello.

221
00:18:52,118 --> 00:18:55,639
[SPEAKER_10]: I also want to thank the superintendent for the documents that he provided to us.

222
00:18:55,699 --> 00:18:57,479
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm glad I got a week to review them.

223
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,500
[SPEAKER_10]: Just a couple questions.

224
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:05,961
[SPEAKER_10]: With regards to the jump, I think it was eight days and we had an additional 94 students.

225
00:19:06,801 --> 00:19:12,062
[SPEAKER_10]: On any given year, how many do we see fluctuate during the month of September?

226
00:19:12,362 --> 00:19:14,943
[SPEAKER_02]: You might see another 50 students in the schools across the board.

227
00:19:16,532 --> 00:19:18,473
[SPEAKER_02]: at least the way it's normally the pattern is.

228
00:19:20,074 --> 00:19:26,217
[SPEAKER_02]: We started before September, we got pre-Labor Day, and that has an impact on some families.

229
00:19:26,257 --> 00:19:27,877
[SPEAKER_02]: Some families just want to take the extra days.

230
00:19:28,618 --> 00:19:32,339
[SPEAKER_02]: And some people don't get wound until they actually hit September.

231
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:35,521
[SPEAKER_02]: So that first week is sort of that thing.

232
00:19:35,561 --> 00:19:43,604
[SPEAKER_02]: But the next week, according to the Parent Information Center, the movement into the schools this past week is not as heavy as it was the week before.

233
00:19:43,624 --> 00:19:44,565
[SPEAKER_02]: It's much lighter.

234
00:19:45,425 --> 00:19:47,026
[SPEAKER_10]: And then when will it stabilize?

235
00:19:47,046 --> 00:19:48,967
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, is there a normal?

236
00:19:49,147 --> 00:19:52,289
[SPEAKER_02]: The first big cut, a look at this thing is around October 1st.

237
00:19:52,909 --> 00:19:59,453
[SPEAKER_02]: We take a look on October 1st, that's when we begin to file numbers with the state as to what our enrollment is.

238
00:20:00,014 --> 00:20:03,115
[SPEAKER_02]: And that drives Chapter 70 funding and other things of that type.

239
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:10,960
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'd like to get a really good handle by October 1st because that tells us what funding we might be eligible for going forward.

240
00:20:12,372 --> 00:20:26,983
[SPEAKER_10]: If I could just request, based on either the parent information center or the school brains database, if we could just get an update, as well as the school committee, mid-October, just when things finally do stabilize so we can just get a more accurate.

241
00:20:27,545 --> 00:20:31,286
[SPEAKER_10]: accounting of the actual school year and how many children we will have in the city.

242
00:20:31,546 --> 00:20:33,687
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think it's going to change the numbers of class size.

243
00:20:34,047 --> 00:20:34,807
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not worried about it.

244
00:20:34,847 --> 00:20:38,648
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to have a baseline of where are we going.

245
00:20:39,288 --> 00:20:42,489
[SPEAKER_10]: I also think the information you provided to us, Council Mox is right.

246
00:20:42,969 --> 00:20:50,792
[SPEAKER_10]: I think you did a little research on the developments and it looked like out of a few developments there was only about 105 students.

247
00:20:52,632 --> 00:20:59,838
[SPEAKER_10]: That on the other end is whether there's too many children and we have this overcrowding issue or there's not enough.

248
00:21:00,219 --> 00:21:04,502
[SPEAKER_10]: This is going to show that the developments that are coming out, they're so expensive.

249
00:21:04,582 --> 00:21:06,744
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, families cannot afford to live in them.

250
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:12,189
[SPEAKER_10]: My concern, there has been a number of units that have come on.

251
00:21:12,589 --> 00:21:15,632
[SPEAKER_10]: We also have Medford Square that we need to make a decision.

252
00:21:15,652 --> 00:21:17,233
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we want to rezone Medford Square?

253
00:21:19,282 --> 00:21:30,210
[SPEAKER_10]: what is gonna happen with Mystic Ave, you have the Locust Street, you have a number of additional units that are coming on, and I just think these are questions that need to be discussed, we need to have a handle on them.

254
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:45,622
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't have, a couple schools have more space, but I know there are two schools that have somewhat of a space issue, and it's just something that I believe we have the right to ask questions about, and I'm very happy we have the answers to, and it's something

255
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:47,113
[SPEAKER_10]: we need to stay on top of.

256
00:21:47,153 --> 00:21:56,023
[SPEAKER_10]: We're the ones that are gonna decide the budget in June, and whether it's us or other councilors down the line, what is gonna happen in two years, three years, four years?

257
00:21:56,344 --> 00:21:59,087
[SPEAKER_10]: So to have some of these answers I think is beneficial.

258
00:21:59,988 --> 00:22:04,052
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know who discussed some of the answers.

259
00:22:04,893 --> 00:22:08,014
[SPEAKER_10]: if it was just the superintendent or if the school committee actually did discuss it.

260
00:22:08,754 --> 00:22:13,895
[SPEAKER_10]: If necessary, they'll consider redistricting to shift enrollment to the Columbus.

261
00:22:14,415 --> 00:22:16,775
[SPEAKER_10]: This is just the start of the conversation.

262
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:22,776
[SPEAKER_10]: If in five years we have an extra 500 students than we do now, or even 300, where are we gonna go?

263
00:22:22,796 --> 00:22:23,536
[SPEAKER_10]: What are we gonna do?

264
00:22:23,556 --> 00:22:24,736
[SPEAKER_10]: How are we gonna space it out?

265
00:22:24,756 --> 00:22:27,517
[SPEAKER_10]: How are we gonna make sure class size stays low?

266
00:22:27,577 --> 00:22:30,037
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think with the group effort, we can do that.

267
00:22:30,117 --> 00:22:33,458
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just wanna make sure we are on top of it and planning accordingly.

268
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:35,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

269
00:22:37,041 --> 00:22:44,524
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion by Councilor Lococourne to report back sometime in October, motion to take this paper, receive it, and place it on file.

270
00:22:44,544 --> 00:22:45,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

271
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:45,724
[SPEAKER_07]: Second.

272
00:22:45,884 --> 00:22:46,324
[SPEAKER_10]: Second.

273
00:22:46,364 --> 00:22:48,665
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll approve the motion to get an update in October.

274
00:22:48,765 --> 00:22:48,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

275
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:50,586
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion for approval.

276
00:22:50,646 --> 00:22:51,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion for approval.

277
00:22:53,807 --> 00:22:55,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion for approval on the amendment.

278
00:22:55,548 --> 00:22:56,148
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

279
00:22:56,848 --> 00:22:57,428
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

00:22:57,648 --> 00:22:58,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Second by Councilor Falco.

281
00:22:58,489 --> 00:22:59,069
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

282
00:22:59,589 --> 00:22:59,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

283
00:22:59,769 --> 00:23:00,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

284
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:02,930
[SPEAKER_04]: And motion to receive the other paper and place on file.

285
00:23:04,251 --> 00:23:04,511
[SPEAKER_07]: Second.

286
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Offered by Councilor Lennon, seconded by Councilor Layton.

287
00:23:07,121 --> 00:23:07,721
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

288
00:23:08,481 --> 00:23:13,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

289
00:23:13,923 --> 00:23:16,044
[SPEAKER_04]: 17647, offered by Councilor Longo Kern.

290
00:23:16,084 --> 00:23:28,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it resolved that the school department provide the administration and the city council with numbers as it relates to how many children in rental units within the city attend the Medford Public Schools.

291
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:29,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Longo Kern.

292
00:23:30,169 --> 00:23:31,750
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that also was discussed.

293
00:23:32,691 --> 00:23:40,456
[SPEAKER_10]: We were given numbers of 105 from five or six different developments that are already station landing, Mystic Valley Parkway.

294
00:23:40,876 --> 00:23:43,377
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks like Mystic Valley Parkway has the most children.

295
00:23:43,397 --> 00:23:48,361
[SPEAKER_10]: River's Edge has less than I expected, but we did get the numbers.

296
00:23:48,421 --> 00:23:57,747
[SPEAKER_10]: I really appreciate that and I hope that once we have newer developments on the books that we get an update, whether that be in the spring or

297
00:23:58,387 --> 00:24:02,469
[SPEAKER_10]: even next fall, that we just keep track of it and know where we're going and where we're at.

298
00:24:02,969 --> 00:24:06,011
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure the superintendent will keep us apprised of that.

299
00:24:06,271 --> 00:24:06,831
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President.

300
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:08,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight.

301
00:24:08,772 --> 00:24:09,593
[SPEAKER_05]: If I may.

302
00:24:09,893 --> 00:24:13,935
[SPEAKER_05]: The issue of affordable housing in our community is one that's of paramount importance at this point in time.

303
00:24:13,995 --> 00:24:18,097
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Councilor Marks hit the nail on the head when he said that families are being priced out.

304
00:24:18,157 --> 00:24:23,940
[SPEAKER_05]: Families that have lived in this community for a long time that have helped make Medford the great place that it is to live now are being forced out.

305
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,641
[SPEAKER_05]: They're being faced with an option as to

306
00:24:26,525 --> 00:24:27,947
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't afford this, so what are you going to do?

307
00:24:28,388 --> 00:24:29,409
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're going to move.

308
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:30,270
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're seeing that a lot.

309
00:24:31,992 --> 00:24:40,061
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to amend the paper, Mr. President, and ask that our Office of Community Development and the Medford Housing Authority do an analysis in regards to Chapter 40R of the General Laws.

310
00:24:40,641 --> 00:24:44,446
[SPEAKER_05]: And Chapter 40R of the General Laws, Mr. President, relates to affordable housing.

311
00:24:45,026 --> 00:25:08,763
[SPEAKER_05]: But it also provides a two-thirds reimbursement on the per pupil cost of students that live in those type of developments So if we're really serious about making a commitment to increasing the stock of affordable housing in our community And we have an opportunity to get a two-thirds reimbursement on our per pupil cost to educate these students I think it only makes sense that we examine that as we move forward So I'd like to amend the paper and request that our Office of Community Development and the Medford Housing Authority analyze the

312
00:25:09,483 --> 00:25:25,017
[SPEAKER_05]: possibilities and potential of creating a Chapter 40-odd district, to increase the stock of affordable housing in our community, to make it family-friendly, and then to allow us an opportunity to capture some of the revenues from the state that will allow us to offset the cost of the per-pupil expense to educate a child by two-thirds, Mr. President.

313
00:25:25,956 --> 00:25:26,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

314
00:25:26,857 --> 00:25:31,680
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion by Councilor Lockern, as amended by Councilor Knight, seconded by?

315
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:32,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor DelaRusso.

316
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor DelaRusso, all those in favor?

317
00:25:34,541 --> 00:25:34,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

318
00:25:35,202 --> 00:25:36,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

319
00:25:37,924 --> 00:25:40,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there more in the suspension, Mr. President?

320
00:25:40,986 --> 00:25:42,486
[SPEAKER_04]: We have one more, Councilor Knight.

321
00:25:44,688 --> 00:25:48,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we got this, all right.

322
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:48,550
[SPEAKER_04]: I need 575.

323
00:25:54,257 --> 00:26:04,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Did I get them all?

324
00:26:04,985 --> 00:26:05,945
[SPEAKER_03]: I skipped over 646.

325
00:26:06,666 --> 00:26:09,248
[SPEAKER_04]: I skipped over 646?

326
00:26:09,288 --> 00:26:09,928
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

327
00:26:09,948 --> 00:26:11,049
[SPEAKER_04]: 17, 646 offered by Councilor O'Connor.

328
00:26:11,409 --> 00:26:23,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council be apprised of the past, present, and future planning that has been and will be taking place to evaluate the increase in our student population as it is related to the space

329
00:26:23,745 --> 00:26:37,232
[SPEAKER_04]: and needs within our schools, be it further resolved that if there has been no planning, the city creates a plan to make sure our schools are not overburdened within the next five, next year, five years and 10 years.

330
00:26:37,272 --> 00:26:38,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilman Locario.

331
00:26:38,494 --> 00:26:48,123
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that also, thank you President Carviello, I think that also was discussed and there's a few lines that the superintendent gave us with regards to shifting and redistricting.

332
00:26:49,064 --> 00:26:50,185
[SPEAKER_10]: So I appreciate that.

333
00:26:50,205 --> 00:26:59,154
[SPEAKER_10]: I just, in the future, I hope that the school committee can really be involved and round table this and we can be involved as well with regards to planning down the line.

334
00:27:00,055 --> 00:27:00,656
[SPEAKER_10]: So I move approval.

335
00:27:01,632 --> 00:27:04,233
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion by Councilor Lococo, seconded by?

336
00:27:04,253 --> 00:27:05,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

337
00:27:05,614 --> 00:27:10,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Dela Rosa, all those in favor?

338
00:27:11,256 --> 00:27:11,937
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

339
00:27:17,819 --> 00:27:18,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

340
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:18,680
17.575.

341
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,442
[SPEAKER_04]: 17.575, petition by Robert M. Penta, Zero Summit Road, River Mass, to address the council.

342
00:27:25,448 --> 00:27:43,560
[SPEAKER_04]: to discuss a review of the Home Rule petition to amend Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 44, Sections 16A and B, inclusive with a local legislative and legislative option provision as it relates to the Community Preservation Act and the Community Preservation Act Trust Funds.

343
00:27:44,975 --> 00:27:46,055
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address of the record, please.

344
00:27:46,095 --> 00:27:50,697
[SPEAKER_13]: Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Method Mass, former member of the Saugus party.

345
00:27:51,557 --> 00:28:09,483
[SPEAKER_13]: I present this to you, and I believe all of you got a copy of, that's a three page document that was mailed out early this summer, pursuant to the request of Council Wendell Curran to explain the rationale behind having a local option filing piece of legislation regarding

346
00:28:11,317 --> 00:28:12,397
[SPEAKER_13]: Community Preservation Act.

347
00:28:13,098 --> 00:28:21,880
[SPEAKER_13]: When this Community Preservation Act was being sold to the folks here in the city of Medford, they were passing out pieces of literature such as this, talked about the Community Preservation Act.

348
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:31,643
[SPEAKER_13]: And on the back it says, communities submit annual reports to the state before receiving matching funds to ensure funds are properly spent.

349
00:28:32,303 --> 00:28:33,044
[SPEAKER_13]: Matching funds.

350
00:28:34,184 --> 00:28:37,205
[SPEAKER_13]: In 2002, which was the first year of the Community Preservation Act,

351
00:28:37,838 --> 00:28:41,602
[SPEAKER_13]: For the first six years, cities and towns got 100% of their monies.

352
00:28:42,723 --> 00:28:45,305
[SPEAKER_13]: And at that point in time, there was 113 communities.

353
00:28:46,646 --> 00:28:51,811
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, in 2015, when the city of Medford voted for it, there's 156 communities.

354
00:28:52,552 --> 00:28:55,535
[SPEAKER_13]: And all we're getting back this year is approximately 14.5%.

355
00:28:55,655 --> 00:28:56,515
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's up to 178 communities.

356
00:29:01,436 --> 00:29:17,262
[SPEAKER_13]: The problem that's existing, speaking to these communities, and a lot of the folks, these legislators in these communities, are beginning to realize now that the tax, the CPA tax, the community preservation tax that people are paying for is not being matched by the Commonwealth of Mass.

357
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:20,321
[SPEAKER_13]: We voted for this in 2015.

358
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:25,786
[SPEAKER_13]: Its first year of payment is now coming to us in 2017, this November.

359
00:29:26,246 --> 00:29:34,693
[SPEAKER_13]: That's approximately $180,000, and we, the committee, collected $1.2 million, $500,000 of taxpayers' money.

360
00:29:35,594 --> 00:29:42,340
[SPEAKER_13]: The legislation that I'm proposing is not to abolish the CPA, but rather to make it fair and equitable

361
00:29:42,858 --> 00:29:51,945
[SPEAKER_13]: for the folks who voted for it, and especially for the people of Medford who believed, when they voted for this, that the Commonwealth was going to match dollar for dollar through the trust fund.

362
00:29:52,685 --> 00:30:00,551
[SPEAKER_13]: And how it's being proposed right now is when you go to the Registry of Deeds, and whether it's a municipal lien or a tax on your real estate deeds, it's $10 or $20.

363
00:30:00,651 --> 00:30:08,577
[SPEAKER_13]: What they're thinking right now is doubling it, and that would constitute another tax on people who buy and sell property.

364
00:30:09,497 --> 00:30:11,419
[SPEAKER_13]: But putting that aside, until that happens,

365
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:27,676
[SPEAKER_13]: It was 2013 when it was then Governor DeVal Patrick who took $20 million, I believe, $25 million from the surplus money of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts just to meet the bare bones minimum of monies to go back to cities and towns in 2013.

366
00:30:29,507 --> 00:30:33,388
[SPEAKER_13]: it was approximately 52% of the monies went back to the cities and towns.

367
00:30:33,848 --> 00:30:34,968
[SPEAKER_13]: We're down now to 14%.

368
00:30:35,988 --> 00:30:46,490
[SPEAKER_13]: And the law says the state cannot go any lower than 5%, which is sort of like outrageous because you're gonna keep taxing taxpayers in this community for something that's not being met.

369
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:56,572
[SPEAKER_13]: People believed when they voted for the Community Preservation Act that the Commonwealth of Mass would match that dollar for dollar, it was advertised as such, and it was stated as such.

370
00:30:57,485 --> 00:31:07,247
[SPEAKER_13]: The two exceptions that I'm asking you folks to consider, and if you don't wanna vote on it tonight, that's all right, but I would appreciate it at least going to the city solicitor for the purposes of the following.

371
00:31:07,927 --> 00:31:17,088
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm asking that there be a hold on the city going further on collecting any monies from taxpayers under the CPA Community Preservation Act.

372
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:18,469
[SPEAKER_13]: Because right now, it's not fair.

373
00:31:18,949 --> 00:31:25,430
[SPEAKER_13]: You're telling the taxpayer that they have being taxed at 1.5% of their real estate value minus the first $100,000.

374
00:31:27,685 --> 00:31:31,709
[SPEAKER_13]: But at the same time, they're not gonna be getting that dollar amount from the trust fund, from the Commonwealth of Mass back.

375
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:33,071
[SPEAKER_13]: That's number one.

376
00:31:33,771 --> 00:31:45,564
[SPEAKER_13]: Number two, the second part of the resolve is that this is a five-year commitment, as you know, and it automatically renews itself after five years, unless there's a legislative question on the ballot not to renew it.

377
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:51,880
[SPEAKER_13]: This second option is to have it go on the ballot automatically to renew it.

378
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,881
[SPEAKER_13]: So it dies, it's like sunset legislation.

379
00:31:54,281 --> 00:31:56,121
[SPEAKER_13]: It just dies at the end of five years.

380
00:31:56,621 --> 00:32:02,683
[SPEAKER_13]: And if the community still wants to have it and they wanna go forward with it, they put it back on the ballot once again and the people can vote for it.

381
00:32:03,663 --> 00:32:13,665
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think it's anything that's detrimental to this community other than the fact you're gonna keep taxing rate payers in this community for something they're not getting their money's worth for and they're not getting the match for.

382
00:32:14,146 --> 00:32:15,706
[SPEAKER_13]: And this greatly will impede

383
00:32:16,272 --> 00:32:25,460
[SPEAKER_13]: This will greatly impede the concerns and the issues, whether it be for parks, historical pieces of property, low income housing, whatever the decision might be.

384
00:32:26,001 --> 00:32:28,102
[SPEAKER_13]: Plus the fact I believe that they're paying somebody approximately $65,000.

385
00:32:28,143 --> 00:32:29,203
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Pender, can I see that?

386
00:32:29,223 --> 00:32:29,424
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.

387
00:32:29,464 --> 00:32:29,944
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

388
00:32:38,111 --> 00:32:46,240
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe approximately right now somebody's getting paid, I believe if I understood when this came out a couple of months ago, somebody's gonna be paid approximately $65,000, $62,000, $149,000, okay?

389
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:48,042
[SPEAKER_13]: So we've collected $1,242,974 from the Medford taxpayers in this community.

390
00:32:48,062 --> 00:32:51,425
[SPEAKER_13]: But all you're getting back from the Commonwealth of Mass is approximately $180,000.

391
00:33:00,615 --> 00:33:01,396
[SPEAKER_13]: That's not fair.

392
00:33:01,777 --> 00:33:03,359
[SPEAKER_13]: That's not the way this was supposed to be going.

393
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:10,768
[SPEAKER_13]: And now with more people coming on board, there's now 176 people applying for these monies from the Commonwealth.

394
00:33:12,384 --> 00:33:23,489
[SPEAKER_13]: and having to go to the registry of deeds to double increase the taxes for municipal liens and for deed stamps that goes on our recordings, that's not fair.

395
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:26,391
[SPEAKER_13]: Just to meet the bare bones minimum.

396
00:33:27,151 --> 00:33:27,771
[SPEAKER_13]: This year it's only 14%.

397
00:33:28,472 --> 00:33:31,113
[SPEAKER_13]: It was reported in the local press earlier this year.

398
00:33:31,253 --> 00:33:33,054
[SPEAKER_13]: You call the state house, they'll tell you the same thing.

399
00:33:33,734 --> 00:33:40,197
[SPEAKER_13]: And you call, for which I had a long extensive conversation with the people in Boston, it's called the CPA,

400
00:33:42,057 --> 00:33:45,041
[SPEAKER_13]: in Boston, their research people.

401
00:33:46,223 --> 00:33:51,229
[SPEAKER_13]: This is not, this is not to say I or anyone opposed to this.

402
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:56,055
[SPEAKER_13]: What I'm opposed to is the inequity that this is now presented here within our community.

403
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:58,138
[SPEAKER_13]: And this inequity is not fair.

404
00:33:58,939 --> 00:34:00,081
[SPEAKER_13]: Because people are believing.

405
00:34:01,105 --> 00:34:08,088
[SPEAKER_13]: If you're only given $180,000 back on the $1.24 million, well, all we're asking to do is to put this on hold.

406
00:34:08,928 --> 00:34:16,631
[SPEAKER_13]: Medford taxpayers do not have to pay for this until such time that the Commonwealth meets its obligation for the purposes of giving the reimbursement.

407
00:34:17,192 --> 00:34:18,612
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what sold this program.

408
00:34:19,032 --> 00:34:20,193
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what people voted for.

409
00:34:20,473 --> 00:34:23,714
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's what they believed that they were getting, a match from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

410
00:34:24,075 --> 00:34:26,876
[SPEAKER_13]: And unfortunately, it's not existing, and it's not there.

411
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,641
[SPEAKER_13]: That should have been told, that should have been explained.

412
00:34:29,661 --> 00:34:37,463
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think, Mr. Clerk, you can attest to the fact over 1,200 people never turned their ballot over in 2015 to vote yes or no on the question itself.

413
00:34:38,104 --> 00:34:43,246
[SPEAKER_13]: So whether the people were not informed properly when they went to vote, or they just didn't want to vote, I don't know.

414
00:34:43,686 --> 00:34:44,586
[SPEAKER_13]: But that's an awful lot.

415
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:54,970
[SPEAKER_13]: And I just think it takes into the serious consideration of today, hard times, people, water connectivity fee, water and sewer taxes, your tax rate keeps going up.

416
00:34:56,006 --> 00:34:59,368
[SPEAKER_13]: new police station, new fire station, a library.

417
00:34:59,948 --> 00:35:01,309
[SPEAKER_13]: Where is this money coming from?

418
00:35:01,489 --> 00:35:06,031
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's the most unfair way to go out and tax somebody right now on this issue.

419
00:35:06,071 --> 00:35:08,352
[SPEAKER_13]: This is a state issue for which people went on

420
00:35:09,331 --> 00:35:17,901
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe that this would be one way to at least mitigate until the Commonwealth of Mass gets its act together, either they're going to give the 100% back or they're not.

421
00:35:18,442 --> 00:35:22,867
[SPEAKER_13]: Why should you deal with the idea that we'll, we guarantee 5% because that's what the law says?

422
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:23,227
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, what's 5%?

423
00:35:23,828 --> 00:35:25,249
[SPEAKER_13]: That's meaningless.

424
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:26,371
[SPEAKER_13]: That is stupid.

425
00:35:27,512 --> 00:35:28,954
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm more than happy to answer any questions.

426
00:35:32,197 --> 00:35:38,238
[SPEAKER_04]: If I could, I called the CPA on some of the questions.

427
00:35:38,278 --> 00:35:50,220
[SPEAKER_04]: The answer that I was given that says there is nothing in the CPA law nor on any state website or on our website, nor in your local CPA ballot language that says that the state match will be 100%.

428
00:35:51,521 --> 00:35:58,742
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, all sources on the CPA are very clear on how the match works on the percentages from previous years.

429
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:03,652
[SPEAKER_13]: With all due respect, Rick, I have a folder here, and if you want to, I'll go over it with you, okay?

430
00:36:04,152 --> 00:36:05,172
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll go over it with you.

431
00:36:05,312 --> 00:36:09,514
[SPEAKER_13]: This first came across the city council in 1991, okay?

432
00:36:10,154 --> 00:36:15,816
[SPEAKER_13]: And in 1991, when this came out, when it became part of its first proposal, I think the then-Method City Council

433
00:36:16,276 --> 00:36:23,743
[SPEAKER_13]: did not want to entertain it at the time because they felt it was another tax on the people, unfairly hitting them without having a say.

434
00:36:23,903 --> 00:36:25,765
[SPEAKER_13]: And you only can put it in those four particular areas.

435
00:36:26,345 --> 00:36:29,628
[SPEAKER_13]: Right now, okay, the people voted for it, we accept that, I got no problem with that.

436
00:36:30,289 --> 00:36:34,573
[SPEAKER_13]: But how do you continue to go forward and tax the people when you're not even getting the money back?

437
00:36:34,593 --> 00:36:37,035
[SPEAKER_13]: You're not even getting 50% of it back, you're only getting 14.5% of the money back.

438
00:36:37,075 --> 00:36:37,595
[SPEAKER_13]: It's totally unfair.

439
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:50,783
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you go to these other cities and towns and you talk to them like I have, a lot of them are not realizing it until you go in there and you start reading the information that they have there and how it's broken down.

440
00:36:51,204 --> 00:36:52,264
[SPEAKER_13]: And I got volumes on this.

441
00:36:53,125 --> 00:36:54,705
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't sit home and read this for my health.

442
00:36:55,005 --> 00:36:55,966
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm concerned about it.

443
00:36:56,246 --> 00:37:00,008
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's an end run on Proposition 2.5 if you continue to tax the people.

444
00:37:01,142 --> 00:37:01,942
[SPEAKER_13]: at the way you're going.

445
00:37:02,583 --> 00:37:03,703
[SPEAKER_13]: This is an alternative.

446
00:37:04,364 --> 00:37:08,646
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a legitimate alternative that a city and town can pose, and until such time.

447
00:37:09,507 --> 00:37:17,571
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is only good for five years, remember that, because the first year that you voted for was 15 to 16, and you had to get those numbers together, so you're not getting that money until 17.

448
00:37:18,812 --> 00:37:23,014
[SPEAKER_13]: So the city of Memphis is only gonna get it for four of the five years on the CPA.

449
00:37:23,034 --> 00:37:26,076
[SPEAKER_13]: And then if it goes automatically after that, it'll be every year on and after that.

450
00:37:26,796 --> 00:37:29,478
[SPEAKER_13]: But what I'm saying is at the end of the fifth year, Rick,

451
00:37:30,413 --> 00:37:40,418
[SPEAKER_13]: the option would be that it ends, it becomes part of sunset legislation, and if the community wants to do it again, they put it on the ballot like they did the first time, and the people can vote it up or they can vote it down.

452
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Questions?

453
00:37:48,001 --> 00:37:49,522
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to receive and place on file, Mr. President.

454
00:37:49,542 --> 00:37:50,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, I, go ahead.

455
00:37:51,985 --> 00:37:53,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, if I could.

456
00:37:54,088 --> 00:37:54,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

457
00:37:56,570 --> 00:38:02,757
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree with a lot of comments that Councilor Penter has made up there at the podium.

458
00:38:03,718 --> 00:38:11,687
[SPEAKER_03]: When I talked to our own state delegation, many of them said that the program itself was a victim of its own success.

459
00:38:12,408 --> 00:38:19,551
[SPEAKER_03]: When it originally started out, the match was much larger based on the number of communities that participated.

460
00:38:20,091 --> 00:38:28,995
[SPEAKER_03]: And over time when communities found out that this may be workable in their community, they got added and the pool of money got lesser and lesser and so forth.

461
00:38:29,695 --> 00:38:41,500
[SPEAKER_03]: I personally would like to see an organized target of our state delegation and the state legislature to say, why you created this program, we didn't create the program,

462
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,642
[SPEAKER_03]: This was created by the state legislature.

463
00:38:44,122 --> 00:38:47,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Why are you not matching the fund?

464
00:38:47,445 --> 00:38:49,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, why are you not providing a decent match?

465
00:38:50,048 --> 00:38:50,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if it's not 100%, maybe 80, 75, 60%.

466
00:38:50,809 --> 00:38:52,370
[SPEAKER_03]: But to go down to, as the council mentioned,

467
00:38:58,335 --> 00:39:08,083
[SPEAKER_03]: 14.5% and if new communities are joining, it's going to be a point, at some point, unless the state legislature acts, that there won't be a match at all.

468
00:39:08,864 --> 00:39:15,008
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think people would have to revisit the issue again, because I vote with the will of the people.

469
00:39:15,309 --> 00:39:20,693
[SPEAKER_03]: The people voted for this, and we have it in the community, and as far as I'm concerned, we have to work with it and move forward.

470
00:39:21,754 --> 00:39:42,448
[SPEAKER_03]: That doesn't prevent us from a legislative body in the community, and I would offer that tonight to send to our state delegation that we ask that the CPA fund be fully funded based on the need and the amount of communities that are anticipating into this program.

471
00:39:42,928 --> 00:39:50,313
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would offer that tonight, Mr. President, that that be one approach that we send a letter as the Memphis City Council.

472
00:39:50,593 --> 00:39:53,595
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was the suggestion from the head of the CPA.

473
00:39:53,955 --> 00:40:01,200
[SPEAKER_04]: CPA was to change state law chapter 44B as applies to all cities and towns.

474
00:40:02,021 --> 00:40:09,666
[SPEAKER_04]: And they suggest that the petitioner submit their idea to the state delegation.

475
00:40:10,106 --> 00:40:11,027
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what I'm asking here.

476
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:13,268
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion to sever the papers, Mr. President.

477
00:40:13,368 --> 00:40:15,170
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President, what are the motions before us?

478
00:40:20,725 --> 00:40:21,785
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a petition.

479
00:40:22,685 --> 00:40:23,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a petition.

480
00:40:23,806 --> 00:40:24,466
[SPEAKER_04]: What petition?

481
00:40:24,766 --> 00:40:26,546
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a motion.

482
00:40:26,586 --> 00:40:28,987
[SPEAKER_06]: Because only a member of this body can make a motion, correct?

483
00:40:29,447 --> 00:40:29,927
[SPEAKER_06]: That's correct.

484
00:40:30,027 --> 00:40:30,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

485
00:40:30,747 --> 00:40:36,769
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's a petition, and it was the suggestion by the gentleman from the CPA.

486
00:40:37,129 --> 00:40:37,989
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Chase, I believe.

487
00:40:38,089 --> 00:40:39,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no, I talked to Stewart.

488
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:42,170
[SPEAKER_04]: He was the head of an agency.

489
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:46,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and he said that was the route to go through the state delegation.

490
00:40:46,291 --> 00:40:50,179
[SPEAKER_13]: You could go through the state delegation, but you also could go through your local legislative body.

491
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,463
[SPEAKER_13]: That's why I said a local home will petition.

492
00:40:52,663 --> 00:40:53,625
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd like to make one correction.

493
00:40:53,665 --> 00:40:53,886
[SPEAKER_13]: I said 1991.

494
00:40:54,287 --> 00:40:58,034
[SPEAKER_13]: It was 2001 when this first came up in the city of Medford.

495
00:40:58,461 --> 00:41:07,048
[SPEAKER_13]: And from 2001, 2002, which was the first year, to 2007, the first six years, 100% went back to cities and towns.

496
00:41:07,528 --> 00:41:11,551
[SPEAKER_13]: But they started off at 34, and then they went to 113 cities and towns.

497
00:41:12,071 --> 00:41:19,377
[SPEAKER_13]: The next year, from 2008 going forward, you went from 127, now up to 176, and it's been downhill ever since.

498
00:41:19,917 --> 00:41:25,662
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, we're just looking at equity, something that's fair to the Memphis taxpayer,

499
00:41:26,636 --> 00:41:33,639
[SPEAKER_13]: especially the one that doesn't realize they're not getting it, that the state is not matching the money, as they said, and that's the term that they used.

500
00:41:33,659 --> 00:41:37,760
[SPEAKER_13]: Their own booklet, when they sent it out, way back when, it broke down all the cities and towns.

501
00:41:38,641 --> 00:41:52,906
[SPEAKER_13]: And like I said, I would just be asking respectfully that the council either forward this to the city solicitor and ask him if this could be done, and if not, then we go to the second row, asking our state legislation.

502
00:41:52,926 --> 00:41:54,687
[SPEAKER_04]: If one of the councilors wants to make that motion?

503
00:41:57,514 --> 00:42:00,937
[SPEAKER_03]: If the gentleman could just clarify if what can be done, I know he spelled it out.

504
00:42:01,277 --> 00:42:02,919
[SPEAKER_03]: According to- If I could just finish.

505
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:16,089
[SPEAKER_03]: I know he mentioned by putting a hold on any collecting of monies in the community and also that the five year commitment, once that ends, that they go back on the ballot.

506
00:42:16,109 --> 00:42:17,009
[SPEAKER_03]: Are those the two?

507
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:36,876
[SPEAKER_13]: Things that you want us to present to the city solicitor asking Right in the letter it designates both sections of the law section to amend section 16 a and section 16 B of the sections 4 to 7 sections 3 to 7 of chapter 44 which this city accepted when they voted for the for the act in 2015

508
00:42:39,803 --> 00:42:42,884
[SPEAKER_03]: But the question to the city solicitor would be the legality of us.

509
00:42:43,064 --> 00:43:01,748
[SPEAKER_13]: The legality of the law or if he would prepare legally a home rule petition that could be forwarded to our state legislators for the purposes of, again, this is not repealing it or getting rid of it, just to amend what's there until such time that the Commonwealth

510
00:43:02,745 --> 00:43:04,306
[SPEAKER_13]: figures out how to give us the 100% back.

511
00:43:04,366 --> 00:43:07,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, but you're also asking us to hold off on collections of any money.

512
00:43:08,369 --> 00:43:09,470
[SPEAKER_13]: That's part of.

513
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:12,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, right, and honestly at this point I don't feel comfortable.

514
00:43:12,873 --> 00:43:14,994
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no, that's part of the proposal.

515
00:43:15,054 --> 00:43:16,536
[SPEAKER_13]: Not now, not doing it right now.

516
00:43:17,777 --> 00:43:28,585
[SPEAKER_13]: Filing the piece of legislation that would allow cities and towns through their local legislative body to hold back collecting until 100% and then the second part would be if this were to be accepted and voted upon.

517
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,161
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor De La Rosa.

518
00:43:31,241 --> 00:43:41,473
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President, a number of people in our community put great efforts into proposing and working on this Community Preservation Act.

519
00:43:43,095 --> 00:43:50,243
[SPEAKER_06]: Under my aegis as president, Council Knight was appointed to lead a task force in developing

520
00:43:50,863 --> 00:44:06,371
[SPEAKER_06]: implementation program and ordinance with the assistance of the consultation of the city solicitor and the primary people involved in the leadership of this effort.

521
00:44:07,312 --> 00:44:12,955
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President, none of them are here to consult us on this.

522
00:44:13,915 --> 00:44:15,536
[SPEAKER_06]: None of them are here to advise us.

523
00:44:16,416 --> 00:44:17,697
[SPEAKER_06]: Quite frankly, I am

524
00:44:21,584 --> 00:44:30,807
[SPEAKER_06]: have an expectation of expertise from them on these matters and questions, and they're not here to present to us.

525
00:44:30,907 --> 00:44:37,210
[SPEAKER_06]: They've been duly appointed by this body, actually, to act as experts and leaders

526
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:42,973
[SPEAKER_06]: in matters regarding the Community Preservation Act in our community.

527
00:44:43,473 --> 00:44:49,057
[SPEAKER_06]: And in fact, they're meeting tonight at the Department of Public Works Conference Room.

528
00:44:49,537 --> 00:45:06,127
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President, at this time, the only action I'm able to take, given our lack of input on this matter, and the matter of timing of removing from the table of this matter, is to receive and place on file or to return it to the table.

529
00:45:07,328 --> 00:45:13,074
[SPEAKER_04]: If you'll allow me to read the advice given to me by the head of the CPA.

530
00:45:13,155 --> 00:45:16,218
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, the petitioner is seeking to change the state law chapter 44B.

531
00:45:17,762 --> 00:45:22,484
[SPEAKER_04]: And have the change apply to all cities and towns who adopt the CPA.

532
00:45:22,604 --> 00:45:23,685
[SPEAKER_04]: That's incorrect.

533
00:45:23,725 --> 00:45:24,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me finish.

534
00:45:25,005 --> 00:45:27,026
[SPEAKER_04]: This is not what a home rule petition does.

535
00:45:27,486 --> 00:45:40,732
[SPEAKER_04]: According to the Massachusetts Municipal Associate, a home rule petition is the process by which individual localities may petition state legislation affecting only the locality.

536
00:45:41,112 --> 00:45:46,995
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, same article states that localities lack home rule power to regulate areas outside of

537
00:45:47,372 --> 00:45:49,253
[SPEAKER_04]: municipalities geographic limits.

538
00:45:49,954 --> 00:45:55,957
[SPEAKER_04]: If the petitioner seeks to change the state law, they should submit their idea for legislation to the state representative center.

539
00:45:56,397 --> 00:46:06,023
[SPEAKER_04]: All citizens have the right to ask legislators to file legislation, so that is the proper way for this person should put his idea before the state legislator.

540
00:46:06,403 --> 00:46:10,626
[SPEAKER_04]: No city council action is required for a citizen to ask the legislator,

541
00:46:11,463 --> 00:46:13,585
[SPEAKER_04]: to file legislation to amend the state law.

542
00:46:14,025 --> 00:46:23,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Since this is not a home petition, and since there is no action required by the city council, it may be appropriate to take the following action when you reach this item on the agenda.

543
00:46:24,493 --> 00:46:27,275
[SPEAKER_04]: One, I explained the procedure to you.

544
00:46:27,635 --> 00:46:29,817
[SPEAKER_04]: Two, we can rule this out of order.

545
00:46:31,648 --> 00:46:38,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so it just plays on file because what you're requesting doesn't involve the city council, it involves the state legislator.

546
00:46:38,991 --> 00:46:44,052
[SPEAKER_13]: If you read the last sentence of my paragraph, the intent of this home rule, local option petition.

547
00:46:44,432 --> 00:46:55,736
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a local option petition filed if the city of Medford feels that they would like to go forward as a local option petition for which the people would have a chance to vote on it, so be it.

548
00:46:55,816 --> 00:46:56,857
[SPEAKER_13]: If they don't have that option,

549
00:46:57,497 --> 00:47:02,644
[SPEAKER_13]: than the local option, then we would take it to the legislature and have them file it for whatever the purposes might be.

550
00:47:03,124 --> 00:47:08,752
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm presenting it because I really think it's sort of like unfair to tax these people, to tax our citizens.

551
00:47:08,772 --> 00:47:11,215
[SPEAKER_13]: I said in 2013, $25 million was taken out of the surplus.

552
00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:20,073
[SPEAKER_13]: In 2014, $11.4 million was taken out of the state surplus.

553
00:47:20,093 --> 00:47:22,654
[SPEAKER_13]: And in 2015, $10 million was taken out of the state surplus.

554
00:47:23,034 --> 00:47:29,638
[SPEAKER_13]: From 2016 forward, there's been no surplus and no money to be taken out, and all that's happening is people are being taxed.

555
00:47:30,078 --> 00:47:33,620
[SPEAKER_13]: Unfairly being taxed for something that they're not getting their money back on.

556
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:37,962
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like you going to the store and buying a new suit, okay?

557
00:47:38,762 --> 00:47:43,465
[SPEAKER_13]: And they said it's $199, you go there, it's $300 because they didn't tell you about all the other incidentals.

558
00:47:44,125 --> 00:47:44,725
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not fair.

559
00:47:45,126 --> 00:47:50,448
[SPEAKER_13]: All we're asking for is equity, fairness to this whole thing, and having an opportunity just to present it.

560
00:47:50,768 --> 00:47:53,050
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, this is not to kill it, to squash it or anything.

561
00:47:53,410 --> 00:47:57,572
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just to bring equity until such time that the Commonwealth can prove, can prove.

562
00:47:57,612 --> 00:47:58,612
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Marks, you just said it.

563
00:47:59,653 --> 00:48:03,835
[SPEAKER_13]: You spoke to someone up there and they said they created something, they can't control it.

564
00:48:04,395 --> 00:48:05,856
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a monster that's out of control.

565
00:48:06,196 --> 00:48:09,017
[SPEAKER_13]: But unfortunately, the rate payers, the taxpayers are paying for it.

566
00:48:09,818 --> 00:48:10,518
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's not fair.

567
00:48:10,638 --> 00:48:11,819
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't believe that that is fair.

568
00:48:14,392 --> 00:48:14,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President.

569
00:48:15,114 --> 00:48:15,596
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's so late.

570
00:48:15,816 --> 00:48:19,426
[SPEAKER_05]: The ballot question passed.

571
00:48:19,927 --> 00:48:21,231
[SPEAKER_05]: Citizens in this community have spoken.

572
00:48:22,449 --> 00:48:27,593
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, the city council met, created an ad hoc committee on the implementation of the community preservation act.

573
00:48:28,534 --> 00:48:30,395
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, we crafted a very strong ordinance.

574
00:48:30,415 --> 00:48:32,116
[SPEAKER_05]: We drafted a very strong ordinance, Mr. President.

575
00:48:33,017 --> 00:48:40,582
[SPEAKER_05]: And just in recent months, this community preservation committee has been appointed and they're finally up and running and they're doing a really good job.

576
00:48:40,602 --> 00:48:45,526
[SPEAKER_05]: And there are a very group of dedicated individuals that are really committed to the success of this program.

577
00:48:46,046 --> 00:48:50,530
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't think we need to take steps as a council to undermine the efforts in the work that they're doing.

578
00:48:50,550 --> 00:48:51,030
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President,

579
00:48:51,957 --> 00:48:54,478
[SPEAKER_05]: I certainly support asking the state delegation to fully fund the paper.

580
00:48:55,138 --> 00:48:58,320
[SPEAKER_05]: I certainly support asking the state delegation to fully fund the CPA match.

581
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,060
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's a no-brainer, Mr. President.

582
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:00,821
[SPEAKER_05]: We all want more money.

583
00:49:01,221 --> 00:49:02,922
[SPEAKER_05]: We all want more free money to come into our community.

584
00:49:02,942 --> 00:49:03,842
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no doubt about that.

585
00:49:04,762 --> 00:49:08,464
[SPEAKER_05]: But right now, we have an opportunity to build upon the successes of the work that we put in place.

586
00:49:08,804 --> 00:49:13,746
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a grassroots effort and a grassroots campaign that came and brought the Community Preservation Act to our table, Mr. President.

587
00:49:13,766 --> 00:49:16,287
[SPEAKER_05]: It's something that was supported by the voters, that was passed by the voters.

588
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:18,188
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not one that's going to stand in the way of that.

589
00:49:18,812 --> 00:49:23,931
[SPEAKER_05]: But ultimately, if we listen to the conversations that we've had here at the city council meetings, affordable housing is a topic that we've talked about.

590
00:49:25,613 --> 00:49:29,174
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm pretty sure Councilor Scott Peli has talked about recreation in the past quite a bit.

591
00:49:29,914 --> 00:49:32,035
[SPEAKER_05]: I know Councilor Longo-Curran has talked about historic preservation.

592
00:49:32,215 --> 00:49:36,056
[SPEAKER_05]: These are three priorities of this council, three things that we've been very, very focused on, Mr. President.

593
00:49:36,316 --> 00:49:38,677
[SPEAKER_05]: And there are three things that the CPA directly provides for.

594
00:49:39,217 --> 00:49:45,378
[SPEAKER_05]: So whether or not the match is 1%, 100%, 14.5%, I don't think we need to stand in the way of the success of our CPC.

595
00:49:45,779 --> 00:49:50,660
[SPEAKER_05]: I think what we need to do is take a step back and let them do some of their work and let them see what the fruits of their labor is going to bear.

596
00:49:51,380 --> 00:50:00,988
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I for one, Mr. President, would support receiving this paper and placing it on file, supporting a B paper to ask our state delegation to fully fund the Community Preservation Act.

597
00:50:01,008 --> 00:50:03,310
[SPEAKER_03]: That was my motion, Mr. President.

598
00:50:03,711 --> 00:50:04,912
[SPEAKER_03]: The B paper is my motion.

599
00:50:04,932 --> 00:50:06,013
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'd absolutely support that.

600
00:50:06,293 --> 00:50:07,074
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd absolutely support that.

601
00:50:07,154 --> 00:50:07,834
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd second that.

602
00:50:08,034 --> 00:50:11,778
[SPEAKER_13]: So, is Councilor Knight saying it's okay to tax the people without getting the adjustment?

603
00:50:12,298 --> 00:50:14,439
[SPEAKER_13]: redemption for why they voted for this?

604
00:50:14,599 --> 00:50:15,339
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's what he said.

605
00:50:25,792 --> 00:50:33,440
[SPEAKER_05]: the people that are appointed to do their job, do their job, and be successful at it, and not stand in the way of it, and not interfere and impede the work that they're trying to do.

606
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:39,106
[SPEAKER_13]: Is Councilor Knight alleging that I'm spewing false information, and that my statistics are wrong, that we're only getting 14%, okay, 14.55%?

607
00:50:39,366 --> 00:50:42,670
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think Councilor Knight is saying that.

608
00:50:42,730 --> 00:50:44,412
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I think you go back and listen to what he said.

609
00:50:45,319 --> 00:50:51,303
[SPEAKER_13]: Why don't you go back and listen to it?

610
00:50:51,343 --> 00:51:03,590
[SPEAKER_13]: I just can't believe that a board would want to continuously tax people in this room, in this community, knowing that it's wrong because the Commonwealth is not at least meeting its obligation.

611
00:51:03,791 --> 00:51:05,211
[SPEAKER_13]: They can't even get to 50%, never mind 15%.

612
00:51:07,833 --> 00:51:08,573
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just wrong.

613
00:51:09,334 --> 00:51:15,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, as was stated to me by the CPA, there was never anything in the law that says this will be matched at 100%.

614
00:51:15,997 --> 00:51:18,958
[SPEAKER_13]: Rick, it's right there on the back of the card.

615
00:51:18,978 --> 00:51:19,859
[SPEAKER_13]: It says matching funds.

616
00:51:19,879 --> 00:51:20,459
[SPEAKER_04]: What's matching funds?

617
00:51:20,499 --> 00:51:21,279
[SPEAKER_04]: It says matching funds.

618
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:23,480
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't say at what percent.

619
00:51:24,601 --> 00:51:26,502
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can give you- Read the history.

620
00:51:26,862 --> 00:51:29,063
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to give you a right from the CPA.

621
00:51:30,684 --> 00:51:31,604
[SPEAKER_04]: There's nothing here that says 100%.

622
00:51:33,559 --> 00:51:35,100
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in its original documents.

623
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:42,545
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have something that says 100%, please show it to me and I will be happy to submit that to the CPA.

624
00:51:42,705 --> 00:51:45,367
[SPEAKER_10]: I think when this was voted in, and you can correct me if I'm wrong,

625
00:51:47,113 --> 00:51:52,659
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Penta, I believe it was 18% when this was voted in.

626
00:51:52,939 --> 00:51:57,343
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't believe, that was going to be my question to you, what does the card say?

627
00:51:57,383 --> 00:52:01,647
[SPEAKER_10]: Because when I had discussions with those advocating for the CPA, I was aware it was 18%.

628
00:52:01,728 --> 00:52:05,832
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the bigger issue, if you're going to fight for or against it, it would be

629
00:52:06,532 --> 00:52:12,934
[SPEAKER_10]: Did people know was on the back of the ballot and if not then yeah, I mean I knew it wasn't it wasn't hundred percent It was 18 and percent.

630
00:52:12,974 --> 00:52:15,615
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe 2015 we vote it was 29 percent I think it went down to 18 now.

631
00:52:15,635 --> 00:52:19,157
[SPEAKER_12]: It's 14 Maybe that's where it comes when it was just talking about the information whether or not what was on the card and

632
00:52:32,078 --> 00:52:35,321
[SPEAKER_04]: So on the motion by- Mr. President.

633
00:52:37,083 --> 00:52:37,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Max.

634
00:52:39,886 --> 00:52:45,852
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, would you like to yield the- would you like to yield the floor to the people behind you?

635
00:52:49,264 --> 00:53:05,176
[SPEAKER_11]: Name an address of the record, please A couple of things that I've heard tonight are that the people voted for this and I have some disagreement with that the people I talked to didn't vote for it.

636
00:53:05,336 --> 00:53:10,740
[SPEAKER_11]: They didn't have any understanding of what was going on and I think I'm pretty much out there and

637
00:53:11,412 --> 00:53:15,556
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would be embarrassed to admit that I didn't understand.

638
00:53:16,417 --> 00:53:21,641
[SPEAKER_11]: So for people who voted for it, they maybe did understand.

639
00:53:21,681 --> 00:53:26,185
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe they're the people who end up with jobs and they think this is a good thing.

640
00:53:26,926 --> 00:53:38,456
[SPEAKER_11]: But for people, I would say the average person, when you look at how few people actually did vote for it, not many people did, including me, who thinks that I know what I'm doing.

641
00:53:39,485 --> 00:53:51,648
[SPEAKER_11]: So I also am very concerned about talk about affordable housing and bringing more people in and traffic and more people in the schools.

642
00:53:52,949 --> 00:53:58,170
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you're going around anywhere around Wellington, it's like a nightmare.

643
00:53:59,550 --> 00:54:03,792
[SPEAKER_11]: And when Wegmans comes in, it's going to be much worse.

644
00:54:05,373 --> 00:54:06,593
[SPEAKER_11]: And the casino.

645
00:54:08,014 --> 00:54:15,278
[SPEAKER_11]: And I have spoken to a few people in Boston who, because I said 1.5%, where's our 1.5%?

646
00:54:15,318 --> 00:54:18,339
[SPEAKER_11]: And they said, very seriously, the state doesn't have the money and the state can't send it.

647
00:54:25,403 --> 00:54:27,745
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's nothing to do with we don't like Medford.

648
00:54:28,225 --> 00:54:32,009
[SPEAKER_11]: We simply don't have the money and we're simply not going to send the money.

649
00:54:32,910 --> 00:54:37,313
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think it's quite reasonable to say we're not going to get the money.

650
00:54:37,894 --> 00:54:39,215
[SPEAKER_11]: They can't send the money.

651
00:54:39,475 --> 00:54:41,377
[SPEAKER_11]: We're only going to get a little bit of money.

652
00:54:42,145 --> 00:54:54,216
[SPEAKER_11]: And I agree with Mr. Penta that you're taxing, I think, a few people who voted for this, and most people who didn't vote for this, and they're not very happy.

653
00:54:54,476 --> 00:55:03,605
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know exactly what the statistics are, who voted and who didn't vote, but I think most people didn't vote for it, and they're not very happy.

654
00:55:03,805 --> 00:55:07,869
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, Democrat, Republican, Independent, people don't like taxes.

655
00:55:08,469 --> 00:55:12,252
[SPEAKER_11]: And then when you talk more taxes, oh my God.

656
00:55:13,413 --> 00:55:28,484
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think there are things we need to do, but everybody I know is very concerned about the police station, the fire station, the library, and the roads and sidewalks.

657
00:55:28,564 --> 00:55:33,007
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been into the senior center and the seniors are always the sidewalks, the sidewalks.

658
00:55:33,908 --> 00:55:36,430
[SPEAKER_11]: And when you're spending money on all these things,

659
00:55:37,392 --> 00:55:39,033
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, people just can't do it.

660
00:55:39,133 --> 00:55:40,794
[SPEAKER_11]: They really just can't do it.

661
00:55:40,854 --> 00:55:42,555
[SPEAKER_11]: They're very, very unhappy.

662
00:55:44,456 --> 00:55:46,857
[SPEAKER_11]: So I support what Mr. Prince has said.

663
00:55:46,917 --> 00:55:49,158
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's a reasonable solution.

664
00:55:49,718 --> 00:55:52,359
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, one other thing, which is a totally different subject.

665
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:57,662
[SPEAKER_11]: I was trying to figure out where to go tonight, and I knew Tuesday was city council.

666
00:55:58,523 --> 00:56:01,044
[SPEAKER_11]: So I called the mayor, and yes, this is city council.

667
00:56:01,544 --> 00:56:02,965
[SPEAKER_11]: There's also a zoning meeting,

668
00:56:04,170 --> 00:56:07,174
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's also a meeting at Hanes about money.

669
00:56:07,954 --> 00:56:12,099
[SPEAKER_11]: And then on the website is the CPA at the DPW.

670
00:56:13,585 --> 00:56:22,112
[SPEAKER_11]: and I know somebody who was gonna go there but is gonna go here, then now I called the mayor's office and they said that one isn't going to be, so I don't know whether it is.

671
00:56:23,013 --> 00:56:25,815
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'm good, but I can't be in four places at once.

672
00:56:25,995 --> 00:56:28,537
[SPEAKER_11]: And I can't also be in three places at once.

673
00:56:28,917 --> 00:56:31,639
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't feel like the mayor really cares about me.

674
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:33,901
[SPEAKER_11]: But you guys have power.

675
00:56:34,502 --> 00:56:40,927
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was thinking you could send a little email to the mayor and say, you know, if Tuesday night is gonna be city council,

676
00:56:41,632 --> 00:56:44,454
[SPEAKER_11]: then let's not have another meeting on Tuesday night.

677
00:56:44,934 --> 00:56:46,656
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that would be a reasonable thing.

678
00:56:47,797 --> 00:56:49,938
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's it for me, unless you have any questions.

679
00:56:54,101 --> 00:56:56,083
[SPEAKER_06]: Citizen Castanetti wishes to address.

680
00:56:56,103 --> 00:56:57,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address of the record, please.

681
00:56:57,664 --> 00:57:05,229
[SPEAKER_01]: Andrew Castanetti, 23 Cushman Street, former Memphis City Council candidate.

682
00:57:05,709 --> 00:57:07,151
[SPEAKER_01]: The lady brought up a good point.

683
00:57:08,552 --> 00:57:10,293
[SPEAKER_01]: City has a scheduling problem.

684
00:57:11,501 --> 00:57:13,983
[SPEAKER_01]: We cannot be in more than one location at one time.

685
00:57:16,244 --> 00:57:19,166
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to go to something about Haines Square.

686
00:57:19,727 --> 00:57:20,587
[SPEAKER_04]: We are on the CPA.

687
00:57:20,888 --> 00:57:23,089
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be nice to have meetings separate.

688
00:57:23,109 --> 00:57:23,729
[SPEAKER_01]: We're on the CPA though.

689
00:57:23,749 --> 00:57:24,390
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

690
00:57:24,450 --> 00:57:27,772
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to speak about scheduling, come back later in the evening.

691
00:57:27,852 --> 00:57:29,453
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just talking about scratch one.

692
00:57:29,894 --> 00:57:30,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

693
00:57:30,114 --> 00:57:31,335
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing CPA first.

694
00:57:31,735 --> 00:57:32,796
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, about the CPA.

695
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:41,837
[SPEAKER_01]: My comprehension of past facts on the CPA vote, number one, in effect, it's an override of proposition two and a half.

696
00:57:43,618 --> 00:57:57,089
[SPEAKER_01]: Number two, I believe approximately 5,555 people voted for the mayor in the past election, and about 5,000 voted for the runner-up.

697
00:57:58,150 --> 00:57:59,010
[SPEAKER_01]: It came out to about 10,500.

698
00:58:03,051 --> 00:58:18,804
[SPEAKER_01]: but approximately only 8,000 voted for the CPA tax, including renters were allowed, approximately, including the renters were allowed to vote for it, Mr. Finn.

699
00:58:21,867 --> 00:58:25,269
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was passed by a narrow margin, I believe.

700
00:58:26,991 --> 00:58:29,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Finn, do you have the margin that it passed by?

701
00:58:30,834 --> 00:58:31,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you recall?

702
00:58:34,714 --> 00:58:35,535
[SPEAKER_04]: 56% to 44%.

703
00:58:35,575 --> 00:58:41,880
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so there's a narrow margin in my opinion.

704
00:58:44,742 --> 00:58:56,672
[SPEAKER_01]: Number three, why did they only require approximately 1,700 signatures to get the CPA question on the ballot?

705
00:58:59,558 --> 00:59:10,482
[SPEAKER_01]: But we, the average people or person, we need 20% of the registered voters, which is about approximately 7,000 signatures to get something on the ballot.

706
00:59:15,484 --> 00:59:21,126
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, I believe some people were involved with grabbing the petitions, worked for City Hall.

707
00:59:23,787 --> 00:59:26,407
[SPEAKER_01]: A director of a certain department I noticed was involved.

708
00:59:26,828 --> 00:59:27,468
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't speak for that.

709
00:59:28,101 --> 00:59:29,161
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if that was legal.

710
00:59:30,141 --> 00:59:31,642
[SPEAKER_01]: Do not be quiet about that right now.

711
00:59:34,902 --> 00:59:41,384
[SPEAKER_01]: Number four, however, I'm not very upset at the extra $60 a year for my real estate tax bill.

712
00:59:42,144 --> 00:59:53,326
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm more concerned I'm three real estate tax bills in arrears at the tune of $4,500 plus fine, plus 14% per annum juice interest.

713
00:59:55,027 --> 00:59:57,027
[SPEAKER_01]: Because some of us are struggling to pay our bills.

714
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:21,579
[SPEAKER_01]: Number five, also I'm most concerned where most of this money will be spent, meaning outside of the West Medford area, we have South Medford, East Medford, Fulton Heights, and I believe these other areas have greater need to improve our quality of life, period.

715
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:23,341
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally, number six,

716
01:00:24,413 --> 01:00:30,755
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, the so-called matching state funds was and is a fallacy, period, again.

717
01:00:31,256 --> 01:00:32,396
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, if you're listening.

718
01:00:34,617 --> 01:00:35,857
[SPEAKER_06]: Point of personal.

719
01:00:36,498 --> 01:00:37,318
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor DelaRusso.

720
01:00:37,558 --> 01:00:43,620
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanna thank the last speaker for his regular reference to East Medford.

721
01:00:43,961 --> 01:00:45,841
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

722
01:00:45,861 --> 01:00:51,784
[SPEAKER_13]: The letter that you wrote from the gentleman from the CPA incorrectly states that this was a petition to apply to all cities and towns.

723
01:00:51,844 --> 01:00:52,244
[SPEAKER_13]: It was not.

724
01:00:53,269 --> 01:00:56,150
[SPEAKER_13]: And that basically... That's what he wrote back to me.

725
01:00:56,170 --> 01:00:56,611
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what he wrote?

726
01:00:56,631 --> 01:00:57,131
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what he wrote.

727
01:00:57,151 --> 01:01:00,032
[SPEAKER_13]: Apparently you didn't translate it properly, or you didn't understand it properly.

728
01:01:00,072 --> 01:01:08,336
[SPEAKER_13]: I kind of transparent what you said to me to make sure that I... But apparently it was wrong because I don't want anyone to be misled to think that I'm asking this for all cities and towns.

729
01:01:08,757 --> 01:01:13,799
[SPEAKER_13]: It was just for the city of Medford, a local community home rule petition option.

730
01:01:17,061 --> 01:01:19,302
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion by Vice President Marks,

731
01:01:21,813 --> 01:01:22,795
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, did you want to speak?

732
01:01:23,816 --> 01:01:24,076
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

733
01:01:25,478 --> 01:01:26,899
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Carolyn Jones.

734
01:01:28,401 --> 01:01:32,045
[SPEAKER_08]: I try to come to- Can we have your address, please?

735
01:01:32,065 --> 01:01:34,047
[SPEAKER_08]: 32 Arlington Street in West Medford.

736
01:01:34,067 --> 01:01:36,090
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

737
01:01:36,110 --> 01:01:37,992
[SPEAKER_08]: I try to come to some of the meetings.

738
01:01:38,452 --> 01:01:41,436
[SPEAKER_08]: My health hasn't been that great, so I can't always get to all of them.

739
01:01:42,809 --> 01:01:53,458
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm concerned about the increase in taxes, about the emphasis on the changes in Medford from the few meetings that I've been to.

740
01:01:53,818 --> 01:01:58,362
[SPEAKER_08]: The emphasis seems to be on younger people.

741
01:02:00,044 --> 01:02:01,665
[SPEAKER_08]: rather than the entire community.

742
01:02:03,326 --> 01:02:25,300
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'd like to see something that happens when, where you can have more people who come out to the city council meetings, that there's more information that's in the transcript so that people know that when they come to a meeting, they know what's gonna occur at the meeting, they know what's happened in the past, and they can be, or feel more readily

743
01:02:26,002 --> 01:02:27,984
[SPEAKER_08]: able to express their opinions.

744
01:02:28,545 --> 01:02:31,248
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have that problem because I express my opinions all the time.

745
01:02:33,231 --> 01:02:44,664
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think that what needs to happen is that the information needs to be more direct when it comes out to

746
01:02:46,005 --> 01:03:13,368
[SPEAKER_08]: the residents of Medford, that there's not just a little card that comes out, but there is something, whether it's in the transcript, whether it's in the mercury, something on a weekly basis that can be an outline of what's going on, whether it's an increase in taxes, and encourage the people who live in West Medford and pay for taxes in West Medford to feel free to come to these meetings, to talk to all of you,

747
01:03:14,482 --> 01:03:16,243
[SPEAKER_08]: to let you know what our feelings are.

748
01:03:16,263 --> 01:03:26,688
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I'm one of the people who doesn't like to see my taxes go up, and that's just because I am retired now, and so I have a fixed income.

749
01:03:27,708 --> 01:03:31,230
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't like to go into my extra money unless I absolutely have to.

750
01:03:31,790 --> 01:03:34,892
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess I got kind of stingy when I got older about

751
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:37,281
[SPEAKER_08]: how I was going to spend my money.

752
01:03:37,941 --> 01:04:00,212
[SPEAKER_08]: But I just think that I would like to see something that encourages more people in the community to come out to these meetings and for more people in the community to really have some good information when they come to the meetings so that they can ask reasonable questions and hope to get reasonable answers from those of you who are on city council.

753
01:04:01,653 --> 01:04:02,473
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all I have to say.

754
01:04:02,533 --> 01:04:02,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

755
01:04:05,020 --> 01:04:09,723
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion by Vice President Mox, Mr. Clerk, if you could read that motion back.

756
01:04:11,064 --> 01:04:22,631
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a letter to the state delegation on fully funding the match on the CPA.

757
01:04:22,971 --> 01:04:24,432
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that correct?

758
01:04:24,712 --> 01:04:25,092
[SPEAKER_04]: That's correct.

759
01:04:25,112 --> 01:04:26,133
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the B paper.

760
01:04:26,193 --> 01:04:27,054
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the B paper.

761
01:04:28,374 --> 01:04:29,115
[SPEAKER_04]: And the A paper?

762
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:32,241
[SPEAKER_04]: is the petition.

763
01:04:33,362 --> 01:04:34,763
[SPEAKER_04]: To be received and placed on file.

764
01:04:34,783 --> 01:04:36,024
[SPEAKER_04]: To be received and placed on file.

765
01:04:38,347 --> 01:04:43,051
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's no appetite here to send this to the city solicitor for the purposes of reviewing?

766
01:04:43,071 --> 01:04:46,314
[SPEAKER_13]: So what we're saying is just keep taxing the people.

767
01:04:46,835 --> 01:04:50,258
[SPEAKER_04]: If someone wants, if somebody wants to make the motion to do that.

768
01:04:50,278 --> 01:04:51,940
[SPEAKER_13]: Well would you do it Mr. President?

769
01:04:52,220 --> 01:04:54,722
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm, Mr. President, you have six other councilors here.

770
01:04:54,742 --> 01:04:55,803
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good question Mr. President.

771
01:04:59,345 --> 01:05:18,195
[SPEAKER_03]: I would be amendable to send this to a subcommittee where we can invite members of the CPA committee where we can invite the city solicitor and we can have a discussion and dialogue around the suggestions made by the petitioner so I have no problem in discussing any issue that comes before us

772
01:05:19,736 --> 01:05:27,847
[SPEAKER_03]: Council, Mr. President, so I would make a recommendation that this be sent to the, which is the best committee?

773
01:05:28,367 --> 01:05:32,292
[SPEAKER_03]: Economic development?

774
01:05:32,312 --> 01:05:33,334
[SPEAKER_04]: Legislative.

775
01:05:34,315 --> 01:05:35,537
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we have a legislative committee, don't we?

776
01:05:36,873 --> 01:05:42,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever committee, it doesn't matter to me as long as the committee gets together and meets on the issue.

777
01:05:42,917 --> 01:05:45,878
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll let you do a committee of the whole, Mr. Vice President.

778
01:05:45,938 --> 01:05:47,019
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to do that, that's fine too.

779
01:05:47,059 --> 01:05:51,241
[SPEAKER_04]: So it'll be our motion to send this to a committee of the whole?

780
01:05:51,261 --> 01:06:00,806
[SPEAKER_03]: And make sure that members of the CPA are invited, the city solicitor, and that residents of the community are duly notified for their input as well, Mr. President.

781
01:06:01,806 --> 01:06:04,608
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion by Vice President Mox, seconded by

782
01:06:09,983 --> 01:06:11,944
[SPEAKER_04]: To have a council of the whole of the committee of the whole meeting.

783
01:06:13,825 --> 01:06:14,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Seconded by.

784
01:06:14,405 --> 01:06:15,105

[SPEAKER_04]: Two in the affirmative and none of the negative.

804
01:06:44,699 --> 01:06:45,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion fails.

[SPEAKER_04]: B paper.

806
01:06:48,321 --> 01:06:49,121
[SPEAKER_04]: On the B paper.

01:07:00,906 --> 01:07:02,187
[SPEAKER_04]: Roll call vote has been requested.

814
01:07:03,642 --> 01:07:04,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

01:07:11,884 --> 01:07:12,104
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

819
01:07:12,804 --> 01:07:13,304
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight?

820
01:07:14,485 --> 01:07:14,685
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

01:07:15,405 --> 01:07:16,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Kern?

822
01:07:16,105 --> 01:07:16,305

[SPEAKER_07]: Vice President Marks?

824
01:07:17,565 --> 01:07:17,845
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Scarpelli?

826
01:07:19,126 --> 01:07:19,366
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_07]: Vice President Calvillo?

828
01:07:20,566 --> 01:07:20,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

829
01:07:21,626 --> 01:07:23,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

830
01:07:24,467 --> 01:07:25,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

831
01:07:25,687 --> 01:07:26,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Penta.

832
01:07:26,567 --> 01:07:27,788
[SPEAKER_05]: We're under suspension, Mr. President.

833
01:07:27,808 --> 01:07:27,988
[SPEAKER_05]: Paper 7661. 7661.

834
01:07:34,738 --> 01:07:40,181
[SPEAKER_04]: 17-661 offered by Councilor Knight.

835
01:07:40,881 --> 01:07:53,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council request that in the interest of public safety and emergency response, the Traffic Commissioner implement no parking between Rice Avenue and Willard Avenue on the odd numbered side of Willis Avenue.

836
01:07:54,427 --> 01:07:55,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

837
01:07:55,567 --> 01:07:56,908
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

838
01:07:56,968 --> 01:08:02,590
[SPEAKER_05]: In front of the stretch of homes between Rice and Willard along Willis Avenue on the odd numbered side,

839
01:08:03,111 --> 01:08:06,955
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll see that it's very difficult for one vehicle to get by when cars are parked on each side of the street.

840
01:08:07,396 --> 01:08:13,743
[SPEAKER_05]: In the audience today, we do have a homeowner that lives along that stretch who's contacted me and asked that we move this matter forward.

841
01:08:14,183 --> 01:08:22,152
[SPEAKER_05]: Ultimately, the residents at 195-197 Willis Ave had a yellow painting in front of the curb.

842
01:08:23,396 --> 01:08:25,358
[SPEAKER_05]: connotating that no parking was supposed to occur there.

843
01:08:25,738 --> 01:08:27,140
[SPEAKER_05]: And over time, that paint wore off.

844
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:34,987
[SPEAKER_05]: I reached out and contacted the Traffic Commission in consultation with Councilor Moxley, who's been working on this with me, and we spoke with the members of the Traffic Commission.

845
01:08:35,027 --> 01:08:36,689
[SPEAKER_05]: The Traffic Commission went down and took a look at it.

846
01:08:36,709 --> 01:08:38,691
[SPEAKER_05]: The DPW painted a certain stretch of the curb.

847
01:08:39,451 --> 01:08:40,953
[SPEAKER_05]: However, they weren't able to paint the curb.

848
01:08:41,587 --> 01:08:44,489
[SPEAKER_05]: the entire length of Willis between Rice and Willard.

849
01:08:44,869 --> 01:08:55,276
[SPEAKER_05]: And they also were under the impression that even though the curb was yellow, if people parked there, the police weren't gonna do anything about it so that the appropriate steps that needed to be taken in order to address this public safety concern would be to put a no parking sign up.

850
01:08:56,217 --> 01:09:10,506
[SPEAKER_05]: However, the archaic and arcane way that we do signage in the city of Medford means that the individual homeowners who was aggrieved by this public safety concern is now asked to get a petition and go knock on doors and ask their neighbors to sign a petition

851
01:09:11,444 --> 01:09:12,845
[SPEAKER_05]: to address this public safety issue.

852
01:09:12,865 --> 01:09:14,647
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't think that that's right, Mr. President.

853
01:09:14,667 --> 01:09:18,752
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that clearly there's a need, clearly there's a public safety concern.

854
01:09:19,429 --> 01:09:38,655
[SPEAKER_05]: and I put this resolution forward to request that the Traffic Commission take the appropriate steps to put the parking restrictions in place so that the individuals that reside on the stretch of roadway can feel safe and comfortable and know that if a fire engine or an ambulance is called to their home, that the fire engine or the ambulance can make it down the street to get to their home to bring them the life-saving care that they need, Mr. President.

855
01:09:38,675 --> 01:09:44,337
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a very simple and basic resolution, and it's really cut out of the cloth for the interest of public safety and emergency preparedness.

856
01:09:44,777 --> 01:09:45,077
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

857
01:09:45,437 --> 01:09:45,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President.

858
01:09:46,538 --> 01:09:47,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Dela Russa.

859
01:09:47,439 --> 01:09:55,863
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm very familiar with that situation and Councilor Knight's assessment is very accurate and I support this motion.

860
01:09:56,124 --> 01:09:56,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

861
01:09:56,744 --> 01:09:57,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Mox.

862
01:09:58,145 --> 01:09:59,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

863
01:10:00,226 --> 01:10:12,433
[SPEAKER_03]: This particular condition exists all around the community and anyone that goes down Willis Ave would say, how can you honestly allow parking anywhere on Willis Ave with two-way traffic?

864
01:10:13,213 --> 01:10:19,416
[SPEAKER_03]: It's tough enough to get down the street just with the two-way traffic, but then when you have a car parked there, it's almost impossible.

865
01:10:20,257 --> 01:10:37,465
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are the issues that we really need to be examined by the Traffic Commission, Mr. President, and I would ask fully that this be supported here tonight and sent to the Traffic Commission for immediate action, Mr. President, on this basis.

866
01:10:38,445 --> 01:10:38,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

867
01:10:38,825 --> 01:10:40,286
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli.

868
01:10:40,366 --> 01:10:41,526
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

869
01:10:41,606 --> 01:10:43,886
[SPEAKER_14]: I concur with all of my colleagues.

870
01:10:43,926 --> 01:10:53,249
[SPEAKER_14]: I did receive a phone call today, and I did take a ride down to Willis, and I concur with Council Mox.

871
01:10:53,309 --> 01:11:00,450
[SPEAKER_14]: It is a mess, so I think that we really need to, as a traffic engineer, start pretty soon, hopefully.

872
01:11:03,708 --> 01:11:04,449
[SPEAKER_14]: dangerous areas.

873
01:11:04,489 --> 01:11:10,375
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, Willis is notorious for many accidents up and down Willis Ave.

874
01:11:10,395 --> 01:11:16,621
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think that I support this resolution and I appreciate Councilor Knight bringing this forward.

875
01:11:17,021 --> 01:11:17,341
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you.

876
01:11:17,361 --> 01:11:17,642
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

877
01:11:18,563 --> 01:11:19,624
[SPEAKER_14]: Name and address for the record, please.

878
01:11:19,764 --> 01:11:21,185
[SPEAKER_00]: Pamela D'Andrea, 197 Willis Ave.

879
01:11:23,227 --> 01:11:31,332
[SPEAKER_00]: I brought this up to Mr. Knight because I'm in that house three, I'm in this city 45 years, but I'm only in that house three years.

880
01:11:31,933 --> 01:11:33,994
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's right across the street from the projects.

881
01:11:34,495 --> 01:11:39,618
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem with the parking is the people in the projects who don't live there.

882
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:42,301
[SPEAKER_00]: and don't have a permit to park in there.

883
01:11:42,701 --> 01:11:46,021
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they park in front of my house, in front of my friend's house.

884
01:11:46,401 --> 01:11:48,362
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody can get in and out of their driveways.

885
01:11:48,882 --> 01:11:56,604
[SPEAKER_00]: And Willis Avenue is not wide enough to be parking on both sides of the street, anywhere on Willis Avenue.

886
01:11:57,224 --> 01:12:04,046
[SPEAKER_00]: I had two DPW guys come down and say they were going in and out on Willis Avenue because people were parked on both sides of the street.

887
01:12:04,286 --> 01:12:05,466
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a safety issue.

888
01:12:05,946 --> 01:12:09,807
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a car fire across the street from us in front of the projects.

889
01:12:10,422 --> 01:12:16,828
[SPEAKER_00]: And this guy that parks in front of my house all the time was parked there and the fire truck barely made it through.

890
01:12:17,508 --> 01:12:18,689
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a safety hazard.

891
01:12:19,010 --> 01:12:20,231
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had accidents there.

892
01:12:20,671 --> 01:12:22,813
[SPEAKER_00]: My mother-in-law, we had to take her to the hospital.

893
01:12:23,153 --> 01:12:27,617
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this guy was parked there, the fire truck and the ambulance could not get down the street.

894
01:12:27,897 --> 01:12:31,801
[SPEAKER_00]: They had to drag her to the corner to get to the hospital.

895
01:12:32,121 --> 01:12:32,682
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not right.

896
01:12:33,321 --> 01:12:38,123
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, people should put no parking signs all the way up and down the road there.

897
01:12:38,803 --> 01:12:41,984
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they shouldn't be parking on both sides of the street.

898
01:12:42,704 --> 01:12:52,668
[SPEAKER_00]: The people in the projects need to know that there's a law, and I'm telling you, as soon as that sign goes up and somebody parks there, I'm on the phone.

899
01:12:53,068 --> 01:12:55,569
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to get told so fast that it's going to be funny.

900
01:12:56,889 --> 01:12:58,850
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I've been watching this now for three years.

901
01:12:59,370 --> 01:13:01,351
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thank you people for supporting this.

902
01:13:02,123 --> 01:13:02,883
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for coming.

903
01:13:02,903 --> 01:13:04,104
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for coming.

904
01:13:04,504 --> 01:13:05,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Lococo.

905
01:13:05,645 --> 01:13:19,072
[SPEAKER_10]: Just briefly, I think everybody's said what they need to say, but maybe just have the traffic commission also evaluate the entire road, possibility of making it parking on one side, if it's, you know, it's pretty thin.

906
01:13:20,153 --> 01:13:20,973
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to amend the paper?

907
01:13:22,294 --> 01:13:25,216
[SPEAKER_04]: The traffic commission will evaluate making it one way?

908
01:13:25,516 --> 01:13:26,636
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, parking on one side?

909
01:13:26,656 --> 01:13:26,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

910
01:13:29,012 --> 01:13:33,993
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to be a B paper just because usually if you ask for two things they split the loaf and I don't want them to split the loaf.

911
01:13:34,053 --> 01:13:37,554
[SPEAKER_05]: I want them to put the do no parking sign up to it.

912
01:13:37,594 --> 01:13:38,774
[SPEAKER_05]: They can go examine the rest of it.

913
01:13:38,834 --> 01:13:45,595
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion by Councillor Knight on the A paper, seconded by Councillor Falco.

914
01:13:46,316 --> 01:13:46,976
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

915
01:13:47,356 --> 01:13:47,476
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

916
01:13:48,356 --> 01:13:55,117
[SPEAKER_04]: On the B paper as amended by Councillor Lococo, seconded by Councillor DelaRusso.

917
01:13:55,637 --> 01:13:56,298
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

918
01:13:56,538 --> 01:13:56,978
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

919
01:13:57,238 --> 01:13:58,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

920
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:02,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

921
01:14:02,221 --> 01:14:04,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to revert back to regular business.

922
01:14:05,343 --> 01:14:11,748
[SPEAKER_04]: If I could yield the chair to Mr. Vice President Mox for the first one, seeing that it's sponsored by me.

923
01:14:12,692 --> 01:14:39,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, paper 17-654 offered by President Caviello, whereas the deteriorated hazardous condition of the public walkway from the driveway entrance at 3920 Mystic Valley Parkway to Locust Street poses a serious hazard to pedestrian traffic, and the lack of adequate lighting makes the specified public walkway more dangerous for pedestrians to navigate between the hours of sunset and sunrise,

924
01:14:40,410 --> 01:15:05,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas excessive overgrowth from trees and low-hanging branches along the public passageway presents an additional challenge to pedestrians, therefore be it resolved that the Memphis City Council respectfully request that the Department of Conservation and Recreation take immediate action to repair, reconstruct the public passageway from the driveway entrance of 3920 Mystic Valley Parkway to Locust Street.

925
01:15:06,250 --> 01:15:18,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Be it further resolved that the Medford City Council request immediate action to be taken to install adequate lighting to illuminate the public passageway from 3920 Mystic Valley Parkway to Locust Street, Medford.

926
01:15:18,718 --> 01:15:26,522
[SPEAKER_03]: Be it further resolved that the Medford City Council request the overgrowth along the passageway and low hanging branches from the trees be trimmed.

927
01:15:27,043 --> 01:15:27,643
[SPEAKER_03]: Council President.

928
01:15:28,673 --> 01:15:29,273
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

929
01:15:30,635 --> 01:15:39,622
[SPEAKER_04]: With the implementation of awakements coming in, you're going to see more and more people walking to the new shopping center.

930
01:15:40,182 --> 01:15:49,449
[SPEAKER_04]: And if anyone's been over to that area, you can see that it's very dark at night and the sidewalks are kind of beat up and the trees are hanging.

931
01:15:49,469 --> 01:15:54,213
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's my recommendation that we contact our state delegation, Senator Jalen and

932
01:15:56,734 --> 01:16:09,917
[SPEAKER_04]: Representative Barber to have the DCI go over there, inspect the sidewalk, and look at the feasibility of maybe putting a couple of street lights in there to help out, let's say, the people that are going to be walking to the supermarket.

933
01:16:10,998 --> 01:16:16,579
[SPEAKER_04]: It is dark there, and you'll be having people from the other moving in, walking over also.

934
01:16:16,619 --> 01:16:25,301
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we could have some lights, and hopefully looking at the sidewalk and trimming the trees, so make it be a little easier for them to walk there.

935
01:16:28,384 --> 01:16:28,804
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

936
01:16:29,965 --> 01:16:35,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a second?

937
01:16:35,631 --> 01:16:37,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Felco, second.

938
01:16:37,132 --> 01:16:39,294
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarpelli, all those in favor?

939
01:16:39,614 --> 01:16:39,714
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

940
01:16:39,734 --> 01:16:40,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Opposed?

941
01:16:40,515 --> 01:16:41,196
[SPEAKER_03]: The ayes have it.

942
01:16:41,256 --> 01:16:42,257
[SPEAKER_03]: The motion is adopted.

943
01:16:42,637 --> 01:16:44,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

944
01:16:44,599 --> 01:16:47,362
[SPEAKER_04]: 17-655 offered by Councilor Luebel-Kern.

945
01:16:48,127 --> 01:16:54,710
[SPEAKER_04]: We have resolved that the city looks into working with a group like Team Better Block to engage in temporary scenarios in Medford Square.

946
01:16:55,070 --> 01:17:03,595
[SPEAKER_04]: The MAPC is currently working with 101 communities, and it would be nice to also work with a company that focuses solely on Medford.

947
01:17:03,635 --> 01:17:04,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor, let go current.

948
01:17:04,815 --> 01:17:06,716
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, President Carviello.

949
01:17:06,736 --> 01:17:09,978
[SPEAKER_10]: In other cities and towns, they use different companies such as

950
01:17:11,310 --> 01:17:15,033
[SPEAKER_10]: Team Better Block, which was brought to my attention and I did some research on it.

951
01:17:15,974 --> 01:17:25,603
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a way, in addition to what the MAPC has been doing for Medford Square and has done for Medford Square, what Team Better Block, I know that the new developments

952
01:17:28,746 --> 01:17:49,943
[SPEAKER_10]: Developed area at Union Square has used that company team better block and I know there are other companies So I just want to ask the administration if that's something that we've looked into or if not if we can look into it team better block is a company that comes in and they focus 100% of their energy on Medford and they do they would do

953
01:17:50,703 --> 01:18:19,420
[SPEAKER_10]: like they've done in other cities and towns across the United States, they would do temporary scenarios, so wouldn't necessarily, and they would engage the public and the community, figure out ways to include almost along the same lines of what we're trying to include, public space, public art, bump-outs, temporary crosswalks, but this is almost on a temporary basis, so we can not only get input and take surveys of what

954
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:35,294
[SPEAKER_10]: the city of Medford wants and what our residents want, but you would, they create bump outs and crosswalks, all different types of public spaces, public green space as a temporary fix to see how it works.

955
01:18:36,415 --> 01:19:02,285
[SPEAKER_10]: and they would do it in all different areas, obviously different areas within Medford Square, and if it worked, obviously you can go to South Medford and West Medford, just to engage the public in ways that aren't so permanent, where people get an idea of, oh wow, if we did do these bumbouts, they're not as scary as they seemed, or not as drastic as they seemed when it was gonna be a permanent thing.

956
01:19:02,845 --> 01:19:12,355
[SPEAKER_10]: Let people understand the ideas that the CDC has come up with, and Team Better Block obviously comes up with additional ideas and additional ways to make it happen.

957
01:19:12,816 --> 01:19:23,587
[SPEAKER_10]: I know they did a project, I believe, on the west coast, and it cost a couple thousand dollars to do a large section of a city square.

958
01:19:23,987 --> 01:19:30,429
[SPEAKER_10]: on a temporary basis, and the life it created, and the community that it created, I think would be beneficial.

959
01:19:30,489 --> 01:19:32,249
[SPEAKER_10]: They would focus 100% on Medford.

960
01:19:32,669 --> 01:19:47,413
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure of the cost, that's one thing that I just didn't research yet, but to actually do the temporary scenarios is very inexpensive, and it's somebody that would focus just on Medford, just on Medford Square, where we do need the revitalization, where people do want

961
01:19:49,614 --> 01:19:53,219
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you want to see change they want to see more activity more green space more?

962
01:19:53,860 --> 01:20:05,937
[SPEAKER_10]: Public art more open space and we're going there It's just we can't afford everything all at once and this would be a way to say these are the five things that we can try out see if they work and

963
01:20:06,938 --> 01:20:17,586
[SPEAKER_10]: And then if it is working and we are able to get the community involved and happy about these different scenarios, we can make it happen as a permanent, you know, a permanent fix, a permanent change.

964
01:20:18,106 --> 01:20:31,836
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's just one idea that has come, was brought to my attention and I think, I don't think see any harm in doing some research on it and seeing if we can look into hiring some sort of company to do this type of work for us.

965
01:20:32,196 --> 01:20:32,697
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President?

966
01:20:34,468 --> 01:20:35,228
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Dela Russo.

967
01:20:35,508 --> 01:21:02,141
[SPEAKER_06]: This idea was presented at the meeting we had on the master plan unveiling a couple weeks ago and I know that this was presented as an option from some citizens and that the mayor was aware of this and is eager to look into this and equally energetic about this matter and these options as the

968
01:21:03,081 --> 01:21:06,564
[SPEAKER_06]: Director of our Community Development Office, Lauren.

969
01:21:09,886 --> 01:21:10,226
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

970
01:21:10,566 --> 01:21:23,095
[SPEAKER_10]: Through the chair, if we could request just an update with regards to what has been done to hire or research companies like Team Better Block and what our plan is going forward, just so we can have an awareness.

971
01:21:23,135 --> 01:21:31,942
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I've only researched the one company for an hour on the internet, watched a bunch of videos and seen actually what work they've done.

972
01:21:32,382 --> 01:21:35,083
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's a lot more than obviously other companies.

973
01:21:35,143 --> 01:21:42,267
[SPEAKER_10]: But what has the city administration done to use more than MAPC that is working with over 100 other communities?

974
01:21:42,387 --> 01:21:44,628
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, somebody to focus just on Medford.

975
01:21:44,648 --> 01:21:48,650
[SPEAKER_10]: A public meeting is great on a Wednesday night, but to have

976
01:21:49,250 --> 01:22:15,710
[SPEAKER_10]: people somebody that will survey and get the community involved and active and it is a community team better buck uses the computer community to create these spaces and if we could get that done, I think it would be Beneficial to the you know in to use it going forward and all our squares is going to be beneficial to the city of Medford so approval that we get an update on where we're at if we've started researching that and if we're gonna move forward with such an option I

977
01:22:16,103 --> 01:22:16,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

978
01:22:16,643 --> 01:22:17,124
[SPEAKER_05]: Councillor Knight.

979
01:22:17,564 --> 01:22:18,844
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

980
01:22:18,864 --> 01:22:21,326
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to thank the Councillor for bringing this resolution forward.

981
01:22:22,106 --> 01:22:26,628
[SPEAKER_05]: Ultimately, I don't think it's any secret in this community we need to do something with Medford Square.

982
01:22:27,189 --> 01:22:28,489
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is just another approach.

983
01:22:29,170 --> 01:22:35,053
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that right now our redevelopment focus on Medford Square is a leave no stone unturned approach.

984
01:22:35,093 --> 01:22:39,355
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is just another tool in the toolbox for us to take a look at, Mr. President, and see if we can make a difference down there.

985
01:22:39,415 --> 01:22:41,076
[SPEAKER_05]: So I support it wholeheartedly and move approval.

986
01:22:43,477 --> 01:22:44,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President.

987
01:22:44,918 --> 01:22:45,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Mox.

988
01:22:46,640 --> 01:22:56,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Just if I could, and I think anything that can supplement an office of community development right now, which is understaffed, Mr. President, I think would be helpful.

989
01:22:57,309 --> 01:23:01,553
[SPEAKER_03]: It was mentioned at that meeting also, and I hope the mayor takes heed to this,

990
01:23:02,153 --> 01:23:06,299
[SPEAKER_03]: that the Office of Community Development staff has not changed since 2005.

991
01:23:06,419 --> 01:23:11,025
[SPEAKER_03]: We still have the same inadequate staffing since 2005.

992
01:23:11,105 --> 01:23:13,268
[SPEAKER_03]: That's 12 years.

993
01:23:13,769 --> 01:23:18,095
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we're looking into one of the largest revitalizations of

994
01:23:18,515 --> 01:23:29,105
[SPEAKER_03]: our business district, and we still have the same understaffed office, Mr. President, and I think is ill-equipped to move this project forward, to be quite frank with you.

995
01:23:29,545 --> 01:23:37,593
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think there has to be a focus by this administration to look into the Office of Community Development, because their main goal and focus

996
01:23:38,113 --> 01:23:43,395
[SPEAKER_03]: is to bring in new business into the community and revitalize our business districts.

997
01:23:44,015 --> 01:23:50,598
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's clear to me, Mr. President, that our five business districts right now need revitalization.

998
01:23:50,918 --> 01:23:51,658
[SPEAKER_03]: They're struggling.

999
01:23:51,878 --> 01:23:53,599
[SPEAKER_03]: We need new businesses to attract

1000
01:23:54,239 --> 01:23:56,320
[SPEAKER_03]: people into downtown business districts.

1001
01:23:56,920 --> 01:24:11,586
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think Community Development Office has met that goal, Mr. President, and is in dire need of additional assistance in that office to move us forward on a project of this magnitude, Mr. President.

1002
01:24:13,127 --> 01:24:14,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

1003

[SPEAKER_04]: Counselor Knight.

1006
01:24:43,359 --> 01:24:44,740
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1007
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:52,785
[SPEAKER_05]: Although Ball Square Cafe is located right over the line over there on Boston Ave in Ball Square, Mike Mosher's been a long time Method resident.

1008
01:24:52,845 --> 01:24:55,887
[SPEAKER_05]: I've known him for the majority of my life, Mr. President, I first met him.

1009
01:24:56,825 --> 01:25:02,927
[SPEAKER_05]: Going into Victor's Deli in Ball Square, that's owned and operated by his parents, Victor and Rosa, and his sister, Nancy, and her husband, Jason.

1010
01:25:03,727 --> 01:25:09,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Michael left Victor's and moved on to the Ball Square Cafe, where he opened up his own breakfast spot.

1011
01:25:09,308 --> 01:25:12,769
[SPEAKER_05]: And let me tell you, it's quite a place to go for breakfast, Mr. President.

1012
01:25:13,109 --> 01:25:14,629
[SPEAKER_05]: But more so, Mike's a great guy.

1013
01:25:15,329 --> 01:25:18,750
[SPEAKER_05]: He puts out a great product, and he's an integral member of this community here in Medford.

1014
01:25:18,770 --> 01:25:19,751
[SPEAKER_05]: He does a lot to give back.

1015
01:25:19,951 --> 01:25:25,792
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I ask my council colleagues to join me in congratulating Ball Square Cafe and its owner,

1016

[SPEAKER_05]: Michael Mosher, a long time Medford resident, Medford High School graduate on the success of the organization.

1017
01:25:31,716 --> 01:25:32,456
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor DelaRusso.

1018
01:25:32,936 --> 01:25:46,265
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President, I can personally attest that last week I had the French toast with halibread, extra crispy bacon, and I had the fancy maple syrup that's real maple syrup.

1019
01:25:47,874 --> 01:25:49,215
[SPEAKER_06]: Comes in a little glass jar.

1020
01:25:49,435 --> 01:25:50,635
[SPEAKER_06]: Very, very good breakfast.

1021
01:25:51,355 --> 01:25:51,916
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm hungry.

1022
01:25:52,576 --> 01:25:54,837
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion by Councilor Layton.

1023
01:25:54,997 --> 01:25:55,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Seconded.

1024
01:25:55,557 --> 01:25:57,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Seconded by Councilor Leono-Kern.

1025
01:25:57,158 --> 01:25:57,778
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

1026
01:25:58,138 --> 01:25:58,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

1027
01:25:58,438 --> 01:26:01,440
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

1028
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:13,185
[SPEAKER_04]: 17657, offered by Councilor Leono-Kern, be it resolved that the City Administration appoint a development committee made up of interested residents who are willing to give up their time to help everyone understand, to better understand

1029
01:26:14,010 --> 01:26:18,891
[SPEAKER_04]: the wants, needs, and recommendations of the community as it relates to development throughout Medford.

1030
01:26:19,351 --> 01:26:20,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Langel-Kern.

1031
01:26:20,951 --> 01:26:23,232
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, President Carviello.

1032
01:26:23,592 --> 01:26:32,053
[SPEAKER_10]: I think this is something that, this issue of the development is something that everybody seems to be talking about.

1033
01:26:32,073 --> 01:26:40,495
[SPEAKER_10]: So many people have different opinions where development should go, how much, how little, not go certain places, more here, more there.

1034
01:26:42,355 --> 01:26:51,625
[SPEAKER_10]: And we don't really have a committee made up of residents to discuss the issues and to get the feedback from the entire community.

1035
01:26:51,666 --> 01:26:59,294
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that's almost necessary, whether it be one committee or it be task force for each specific area.

1036
01:26:59,975 --> 01:27:03,539
[SPEAKER_10]: It was requested that there also be

1037
01:27:03,979 --> 01:27:17,526
[SPEAKER_10]: which I'm going to amend the paper, there'd be a Mystic Ave task force made up of residents who want to see development in Mystic Ave and want to have input and voice their concerns and ask questions and be able to

1038
01:27:19,327 --> 01:27:22,409
[SPEAKER_10]: figure out what the community wants down there.

1039
01:27:22,449 --> 01:27:23,430
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that's important.

1040
01:27:23,450 --> 01:27:30,815
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's something that's been lacking with regards to some of the projects that have moved forward over the last several years.

1041
01:27:30,875 --> 01:27:31,896
[SPEAKER_10]: No community input.

1042
01:27:32,036 --> 01:27:35,959
[SPEAKER_10]: It goes on the Zoning Board of Appeals agenda and gets approved.

1043
01:27:36,755 --> 01:27:40,097
[SPEAKER_10]: I think Canal Street is the only one that I know that did not get approved.

1044
01:27:40,177 --> 01:27:42,578
[SPEAKER_10]: But we need more community input.

1045
01:27:42,798 --> 01:27:44,880
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think this is the way to do it.

1046
01:27:45,540 --> 01:27:48,822
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the committee, hopefully the mayor, would be willing to set up a

1047
01:27:50,625 --> 01:28:11,750
[SPEAKER_10]: a task force or a development committee made up of Medford residents from all different areas, and I'd like to amend the paper to ask that a Mystic Ave task force be put in place made up of South Medford residents and business owners who work on Mystic Ave, because that's coming down the line, and we want to make sure we're prepared for it.

1048
01:28:13,030 --> 01:28:26,542
[SPEAKER_10]: I think this is something that's long overdue, and I believe the council, whether we have a council rep on the committee, if this isn't moved forward, I think it's best to be organized by the administration.

1049
01:28:26,682 --> 01:28:33,588
[SPEAKER_10]: If it's not moved forward by the administration, then I think the council has to create a committee within our own body to

1050
01:28:36,109 --> 01:28:41,693
[SPEAKER_10]: be able to discuss development in subcommittee and get the community involved as much as we can and get input.

1051
01:28:42,373 --> 01:28:47,136
[SPEAKER_10]: It's hard when you're trying to see everything that's being written everywhere and try to get

1052
01:28:48,801 --> 01:29:00,788
[SPEAKER_10]: Try to form your opinions on where development should go and how much of it when you don't have sit-down meetings to discuss it I think that's what's what's missing For me as one counselor.

1053
01:29:00,808 --> 01:29:09,993
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not against development, but if a neighborhood like near the mall didn't want 500 units that you know our votes and our

1054
01:29:11,053 --> 01:29:28,531
[SPEAKER_10]: requests and our concerns stem from what the neighborhoods want and things are moving so quickly I think we need to be on top of it and a development committee to discuss development in general and then also different task force one specifically for Mystic Ave is what we need.

1055
01:29:30,371 --> 01:29:30,991
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, Scott Belly.

1056
01:29:31,672 --> 01:29:32,492
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1057
01:29:32,572 --> 01:29:36,635
[SPEAKER_14]: I thank my colleague for bringing this motion forward.

1058
01:29:36,655 --> 01:29:45,380
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the mayor has done a very good job of getting constituents involved with different task force.

1059
01:29:45,460 --> 01:29:51,083
[SPEAKER_14]: I can attest to that with the recreation committee that worked so hard to see that through fruition.

1060
01:29:51,103 --> 01:29:57,507
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that with so many questions and issues we have with development and so many educated

1061
01:30:00,344 --> 01:30:13,794
[SPEAKER_14]: people in our community that if you went to the development hearing and you listened about the revitalization of Meffitt Square and the ideas from the different constituents, I think that would be a welcome attribute that

1062
01:30:16,015 --> 01:30:18,196
[SPEAKER_14]: that we should be using here in our community.

1063
01:30:18,236 --> 01:30:41,468
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think that I would second my fellow councilor's resolution, and I would hope the mayor's office will support that for the fact that a lot of the great things that are happening have come about with different task forces and committees that she started back in her beginning of her term.

1064
01:30:41,528 --> 01:30:43,569
[SPEAKER_14]: So I thank you for bringing that up.

1065
01:30:44,803 --> 01:30:45,444
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Falco.

1066
01:30:45,584 --> 01:30:46,384
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1067
01:30:46,484 --> 01:30:48,906
[SPEAKER_09]: I thank the council for bringing this resolution forward.

1068
01:30:48,946 --> 01:31:03,238
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a resolution that I support and I do believe that there are many qualified professional people, you know, with professional backgrounds in different, you know, in development and traffic engineering and whatnot throughout our community that can really help out.

1069
01:31:03,758 --> 01:31:05,740
[SPEAKER_09]: with regard to the future development in our city.

1070
01:31:06,261 --> 01:31:12,506
[SPEAKER_09]: And who knows better than the people that actually live in that neighborhood on a daily basis what works and what doesn't work.

1071
01:31:12,927 --> 01:31:17,111
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think it's always important to reach out to the neighborhoods and get their input.

1072
01:31:17,151 --> 01:31:18,592
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think this is a great way of doing it.

1073
01:31:18,832 --> 01:31:21,095
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is a resolution that I do support.

1074
01:31:21,455 --> 01:31:23,036
[SPEAKER_09]: I think having people

1075

[SPEAKER_09]: You know in the neighborhoods that are active that want to be involved that want to help shape the future of their communities important and their input Should definitely be heard.

1076
01:31:31,859 --> 01:31:33,499
[SPEAKER_09]: So I support the resolution as well.

1079
01:31:53,064 --> 01:31:54,985

1080
01:31:55,105 --> 01:31:55,966
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1081
01:31:55,986 --> 01:32:10,312
[SPEAKER_03]: This was brought to my attention by a concerned resident that was dropping off a child and said there's been a pothole right in the middle of the crosswalk to the McGlynn School entrance and that it's a rather deep pothole that needs to be filled.

1082
01:32:10,352 --> 01:32:14,634
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would ask that this be filled in the interest of public safety immediately.

1083
01:32:15,154 --> 01:32:16,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1084

1088
01:32:23,599 --> 01:32:23,940
[SPEAKER_04]: 17-659.

[SPEAKER_04]: Progress.

1090
01:32:24,980 --> 01:32:30,584
[SPEAKER_04]: Offered by Councilor Lococo and be it resolved that the Department of Public Works place a graphic on South Street

1091
01:32:31,918 --> 01:32:36,721
[SPEAKER_04]: at the intersection of Walnut to help warn the vehicles that there is a crosswalk.

1092
01:32:37,041 --> 01:32:38,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Council Member O'Connor.

1093
01:32:38,322 --> 01:32:40,043
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, President Carviello.

1094
01:32:40,143 --> 01:32:54,452
[SPEAKER_10]: This is one of my several attempts for traffic calming on South Street because there are a number of residents that are working together to try to curb the speeding and obviously the heavy trucking that is speeding.

1095
01:32:55,562 --> 01:33:01,804
[SPEAKER_10]: There's been stop signs that have been put up, crosswalk signs that have been put up, and a number of different things.

1096
01:33:01,964 --> 01:33:05,966
[SPEAKER_10]: The speed monitor sign, the new one that we have, there's one placed on South Street.

1097
01:33:05,986 --> 01:33:09,207
[SPEAKER_10]: There's also one placed on Lawrence Road, which is great to see.

1098
01:33:09,887 --> 01:33:12,408
[SPEAKER_10]: If you go over the speed limit, they start flashing.

1099
01:33:12,508 --> 01:33:12,968
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a little.

1100
01:33:13,048 --> 01:33:14,409
[SPEAKER_04]: The blue light says we have a police guy there.

1101
01:33:14,909 --> 01:33:15,149
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1102
01:33:15,329 --> 01:33:23,232
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I mean, what we're doing here and getting the speed monitor signs and working, Sergeant Hartnett has been great to get

1103
01:33:24,355 --> 01:33:27,299
[SPEAKER_10]: some, you know, the speed reduced on some of our streets.

1104
01:33:27,459 --> 01:33:37,773
[SPEAKER_10]: South Street, when I went to the Traffic Commission meeting a couple weeks ago, this was brought up, requested, and it was something that I believe the Chief of Police was on board with.

1105
01:33:37,913 --> 01:33:40,277
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just a matter of getting the Department of Public Works to put

1106
01:33:40,777 --> 01:33:49,666
[SPEAKER_10]: down a big graphic, the graphic that shows that there's a crosswalk coming up ahead, which it's only a few feet before the crosswalk, but it's just a little extra.

1107
01:33:50,067 --> 01:34:00,177
[SPEAKER_10]: There are hundreds of people, like I said, I think a couple weeks ago, that cross south to Walnut because it's the gateway to the square leading into Colleen's ice cream shop.

1108
01:34:00,503 --> 01:34:03,165
[SPEAKER_10]: when you cross that bridge right into the heart of Medford Square.

1109
01:34:03,185 --> 01:34:08,770
[SPEAKER_10]: So if we could get a graphic put on by the DPW, it would be greatly appreciated.

1110
01:34:08,790 --> 01:34:16,176
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's one of the many measures that are going on on South Street to help with the speeding and to help pedestrian safety.

1111
01:34:16,196 --> 01:34:17,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1112
01:34:17,344 --> 01:34:18,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor De La Rosa.

1113
01:34:18,344 --> 01:34:21,005
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President, I agree with this measure.

1114
01:34:21,025 --> 01:34:27,287
[SPEAKER_06]: I, however, believe that that is the new standard for any repairs that are done in the streets.

1115
01:34:27,847 --> 01:34:36,190
[SPEAKER_06]: And where that intersection is being, the corner of Winthrop and South Street is being renovated at this time.

1116
01:34:36,670 --> 01:34:44,633
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe that any significant renovations must end with the cross scoring that's applied into the street.

1117
01:34:45,533 --> 01:34:56,279
[SPEAKER_06]: as well as the new style of access ramps on the sidewalks with the hobnails in the ramp on the pad and other measures the like.

1118
01:34:56,859 --> 01:35:06,964
[SPEAKER_06]: We can see this demonstrated most clearly with the work that's been done at the intersections of College Avenue and Boston Avenue.

1119
01:35:07,845 --> 01:35:10,946
[SPEAKER_06]: So I agree with this and second approval.

1120
01:35:11,847 --> 01:35:13,668
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion, Councilor Locker?

1121
01:35:14,766 --> 01:35:28,185
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, just I think I think he was talking about Winthrop himself and this is with regards to walnut not walnut himself There's no construction until ever source in this part of that Street, so I just want to make sure that was yes, that was clear Vice-president box

1122
01:35:30,588 --> 01:35:34,631
[SPEAKER_03]: I, too, would like to just thank DPW over the last several weeks.

1123
01:35:34,711 --> 01:35:39,654
[SPEAKER_03]: They have erected 42 speed limit signs now.

1124
01:35:40,134 --> 01:35:46,959
[SPEAKER_03]: With the vote of this council, we have reduced the speed on many of our thoroughfares from 30 to 25 miles an hour.

1125
01:35:47,399 --> 01:35:50,401
[SPEAKER_03]: And indeed, those signs are being posted throughout the community.

1126
01:35:50,841 --> 01:35:54,764
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just want to thank DPW and the Traffic Commission for their efforts.

1127
01:35:55,564 --> 01:35:56,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1164
01:38:29,900 --> 01:38:32,283
[SPEAKER_03]: I know DPW is diligently working on

1165
01:38:33,003 --> 01:38:34,745
[SPEAKER_03]: the painting of many of our crosswalks.

1166
01:38:35,286 --> 01:38:49,503
[SPEAKER_03]: However, Highland Ave, I know, is a state road, and I would ask that our DPW reach out to the state to get the state on top of painting the crosswalks, Mr. President, in the interest of public safety.

1167
01:38:50,443 --> 01:39:00,911
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, Mr. President, if I could, I had the opportunity this past Saturday, there was a young gentleman in our community who was going for his Eagle Scout badge.

1168
01:39:00,931 --> 01:39:02,532
[SPEAKER_03]: His name is John Fee.

1169
01:39:03,213 --> 01:39:11,839
[SPEAKER_03]: And the project he selected, which I thought was a pretty unique project to assist this community, was to erect 100 hydrant markers.

1170
01:39:14,781 --> 01:39:35,152
[SPEAKER_03]: to alert the fire department and also residents in a time when snow gets heavy where fire hydrants are located and John fee reached out to the vocational school the vocational students bent up the wrought iron cut the cut it for John John and his scouts painted them and

1171
01:39:35,532 --> 01:39:45,640
[SPEAKER_03]: And this past Saturday, with the thanks of Mr. Tanaglia in DPW and Mr. Krueger in the Water Department, they went out and erected 100 of these.

1172
01:39:46,181 --> 01:39:53,367
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can tell you, they're going to last forever, these particular hydroponics, and it's a great community project.

1173
01:39:54,167 --> 01:40:07,997
[SPEAKER_03]: And something that I know I've spoken about a number of times, and it's great to see someone in the community step forward and make such a positive change on behalf of the residents, Mr. President.

1174
01:40:08,198 --> 01:40:09,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1175
01:40:09,358 --> 01:40:14,562
[SPEAKER_04]: If I can amend that, if we can invite him here to receive a citation in the near future?

1176
01:40:15,563 --> 01:40:17,564
[SPEAKER_03]: As soon as he gets his Eagle Scout badge.

1177
01:40:18,065 --> 01:40:19,706
[SPEAKER_03]: This was a step in the process.

1178
01:40:20,407 --> 01:40:21,908
[SPEAKER_03]: He will be invited, and I appreciate that.

1179

01:40:35,358 --> 01:40:35,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

1189
01:40:36,999 --> 01:40:38,420
[SPEAKER_04]: Offered by Councilor Falco.

1190
01:40:39,501 --> 01:40:44,104
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas the Memphis Farmer's Market takes place at the Carpenter's Shell on the banks of the Mississippi River.

1191
01:40:44,625 --> 01:40:47,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas the Farmer's Market is from 3 to 7 p.m.

1192
01:40:47,887 --> 01:40:48,988
[SPEAKER_04]: on Thursday afternoon.

1193
01:40:49,368 --> 01:40:51,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it resolved that the Mayor's Office

1194
01:40:55,045 --> 01:40:58,620
[SPEAKER_04]: activated in the interest of public safety.

1195
01:40:59,788 --> 01:41:00,588
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Falco.

1196
01:41:00,688 --> 01:41:01,748
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1197
01:41:01,909 --> 01:41:08,390
[SPEAKER_09]: I had the opportunity this weekend to go along with a lot of my colleagues to go to the Mystic River Celebration.

1198
01:41:09,190 --> 01:41:16,452
[SPEAKER_09]: And while I was there, I was going to some of the different tables and, you know, just, you know, getting more information, talking to people and whatnot.

1199
01:41:16,692 --> 01:41:23,314
[SPEAKER_09]: And they went to the Method Farmers Market table and just asked them because I think this is their first year in the new locations down at the Condon Shell.

1200
01:41:23,814 --> 01:41:25,814
[SPEAKER_09]: And they said so far it's been really, really good.

1201
01:41:25,834 --> 01:41:29,275
[SPEAKER_09]: They've had a lot of great activity, a lot of people walking down on Thursday afternoons to

1202
01:41:30,155 --> 01:41:36,039
[SPEAKER_09]: just buy some local produce and whatnot, and just ask them a little bit about the new location.

1203
01:41:36,399 --> 01:41:37,960
[SPEAKER_09]: And they said it's great.

1204
01:41:38,100 --> 01:41:46,264
[SPEAKER_09]: They said the challenge now is it's towards the end of the season, so the sun goes down a little bit sooner, and the market goes until 7 PM.

1205
01:41:46,324 --> 01:41:51,107
[SPEAKER_09]: So that last hour, it's getting dark, basically.

1206
01:41:51,387 --> 01:41:59,252
[SPEAKER_09]: And so it's tough for people to walk around, and it's also tough for the vendors to clean up after the market closes down.

1207
01:41:59,992 --> 01:42:14,564
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, in the matter of public in the, you know, matter of public safety, it'd be nice if we could have the mayor's office of the electric department, see what they can do to have the lights activated for at least the last hour of the farmers market on Thursday afternoon.

1208
01:42:14,584 --> 01:42:19,127
[SPEAKER_09]: So it would probably be, it'd be nice if they could activate them from probably anytime after five to at least

1209
01:42:19,988 --> 01:42:21,729
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm guessing maybe 7.30 p.m.

1210
01:42:22,329 --> 01:42:24,249
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's safe down there.

1211
01:42:24,309 --> 01:42:25,190
[SPEAKER_09]: It should be well lit.

1212
01:42:25,930 --> 01:42:33,472
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's a great venue to have really any type of local city function.

1213
01:42:33,952 --> 01:42:39,754
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's in the matter of public safety, if we could afford that to the mayor's office of the electrical department, I'd greatly appreciate it.

[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli, how did you find those records?

1230
01:43:20,170 --> 01:43:25,796
[SPEAKER_14]: If I could table these for a week to look in further depth, I'd appreciate it.

[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Mox.

1237
01:43:37,608 --> 01:43:48,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Before we adjourn, if you can just get this body estimated time when we will be back in the Alderman Chambers for our regularly scheduled meetings, I think that would be helpful.

1238
01:43:49,214 --> 01:43:51,195
[SPEAKER_04]: I was there.

1239
01:43:51,555 --> 01:43:51,955
[SPEAKER_04]: I've looked.

1240
01:43:52,035 --> 01:43:52,756
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like it's

1241
01:43:54,509 --> 01:43:58,953
[SPEAKER_04]: It's close, I would think maybe next week, hopefully will be the last week that we'll be here.

1242
01:43:59,593 --> 01:44:08,600
[SPEAKER_04]: But if we can get a more definite- I will try my hardest to, I've tried to get an answer from the people working in there and I couldn't get a definitive answer from them.

1243
01:44:08,940 --> 01:44:11,362
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe the administration- I will talk to the administration.

01:44:27,250 --> 01:44:34,113
[SPEAKER_10]: So I did reach out to Lauren Felch from the mayor's office and she did say the beginning of October we should be back in the chamber.

1247
01:44:36,195 --> 01:44:37,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, nobody's complaining more than us.
