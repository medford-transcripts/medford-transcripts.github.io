    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=10.494s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=14.556s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=15.317s">I'll</a>  just say present. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=17.818s">7</a>  present, none absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=22.241s">The</a>  meeting is called to order.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=28.899s">There</a>  will be a meeting of the Medford City Council Committee of the Whole on Wednesday, January 17th, 2024 at 6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=34.223s">in</a>  the Medford City Council Chamber on the second floor of Medford City Hall and via Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=38.747s">The</a>  purpose of this meeting is to discuss compensation for the Medford School Committee, paper <a href="../resolutions/23-467.pdf"><font color="green">23-467</font></a>. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=44.511s">For</a>  further information, aids, and accommodations, please contact the city clerk at 781-393-2425. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=50.796s">Sincerely</a>  yours, Isaac B. Zach Bears, Council President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=54.579s">Thank</a>  you all for being here today. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=57.357s">We</a>  are here, as I just said, to discuss paper <a href="../resolutions/23-467.pdf"><font color="green">23-467</font></a>, a proposal from the prior council by former Council President Morell regarding the compensation of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=69.661s">Just</a>  a few things before we start. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=72.322s">Number</a>  one, Councilor Lazzaro is attending remotely tonight due to illness. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=78.723s">Hope</a>  you feel better, Councilor Lazzaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=80.204s">Thank</a>  you for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=81.584s">That</a>  means that all votes will be roll call votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=85.333s">Second,</a>  just to go quickly through, the proposal by President Morell, as amended by President Morell and Councilor Knight on December 12th, is before us tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=95.32s">Short</a>  summary is the initial proposal folks have read was to place the school committee pay at 29,359.80 cents, the chair at 32,550, vice chair at 30,640, and secretary at 31,760. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=114.751s">amendments</a>  were offered to strike several clauses regarding the composition of the Menford School Committee and City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=122.035s">Amendment</a>  was offered to phase in these adjustments over time, and Councilor Knight offered a number of amendments, including questions regarding state law, Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 44, Section 33, 71, Section 53, 71, 52, and 4433A. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=134.501s">I</a>  do have legal opinion from <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=144.622s">of</a>  the city's outside legal counsel, KP Law, which I can read into the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=150.464s">In</a>  my opinion, if there's available funding in the Medford School Department budget for this current fiscal year to pay for an improved increase in school committee compensation, then there does not need to be a supplemental appropriation request, given that the school department's fiscal year budget is a bottom line budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=165.088s">Approval</a>  of the increase would be required pursuant to general law chapter 71, section 52, <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=170.339s">given</a>  the requirements set forth in the statute as outlined below. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=173.7s">In</a>  my opinion, general laws chapter 71, section 52 govern this request, which requires generally a majority vote of the city council to change compensation for school committee members. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=184.165s">In</a>  my further opinion, in reviewing the proposal, the city council may inquire from the school department regarding funds in the fiscal year 24 budget, if any increases in approved and effective for this current fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=194.889s">If</a>  a supplemental appropriation is required, the increase would be subject <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=198.444s">to</a>  applicable municipal finance principles, including pursuant to General Law, Chapter 44, Section 33A. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=204.868s">If</a>  the City Council approves an increase to school committee compensation pursuant to General Law, Chapter 71, Section 52, to go into effect beginning July 1, 2024 for fiscal year 2025, in my opinion, such amounts would be incorporated into the bottom line budget request for fiscal year 2025 for review by the City Council, indeed under state law, <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=226.536s">And</a>  according to Desi guidance, the following provisions apply to school budgets that outlines the standard process for the setting of the budget every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=237.719s">Please</a>  let me know if there are further questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=239.16s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=240.14s">And</a>  in a sense, essentially that addresses the questions regarding whether this is subject to the provision of a two thirds vote of the council being required. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=250.555s">essentially,</a>  if a supplemental appropriation required in this were to go into effect in the middle of a fiscal year, then the answer would be yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=258.121s">If</a>  this were to go into effect on the start of a new fiscal year, then a simple majority is required under Chapter 71, Section 52. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=266.529s">And</a>  so with that, and with the amendments to the questions, I will turn it over to my fellow councilors for comment and discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=275.676s">And</a>  I see Councilor Collins and then Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=278.178s">Councilor</a>  Collins.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=280.353s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=281.714s">Thank</a>  you so much, everybody, for being here today. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=284.376s">We</a>  really appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=285.236s">A</a>  lot to discuss here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=287.978s">I</a>  just want to start by saying I know that this discussion of this in the community has surfaced some painful and necessary truths about the underfunding of the schools and the need to provide every school worker with a living wage. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=303.545s">I</a>  appreciate that that's been one of the reminders that's come out of the discussion I just want to frame with that as a reassurance that as we talk about raising compensation for school committee for the first time in 23 years that that is close on my mind to speak only for myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=322.603s">City</a>  Council is no legal authority to make allocations within the school's budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=327.505s">I'm</a>  sure that there's been times when we all wish we had that authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=330.827s">We</a>  don't have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=333.027s">This</a>  is one thing that we do have authority over. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=336.669s">The</a>  mindset that I'm coming to this discussion with is <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=341.823s">We</a>  know it's been 23 years since school committee had a cost of living adjustment or any sort of rationale for a compensation increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=350.167s">As</a>  a Councilor with a vote to change that, I feel a responsibility to change that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=354.429s">It's</a>  something that I have the responsibility to change. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=356.69s">We</a>  don't have any jurisdiction over any other salaries when it comes to the school's department. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=361.392s">This</a>  is one thing that we do have authority over. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=364.334s">And</a>  as a Councilor, knowing a bit about <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=367.375s">Our</a>  job, knowing a little bit about the school committee members job though of course, not with that level of granular detail, but knowing how hard our school committee members work as all public servants do in our various roles that are, you know, hard to compare but all contribute to. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=384.582s">necessary</a>  work of the public sphere. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=387.406s">Contemplating</a>  an increase for school committee members is something that, you know, I've gone on record and say I think that these jobs are equivalent. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=394.695s">I'd</a>  like for us to consider, you know, leveling pay between these two legislative bodies. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=401.383s">But</a>  I'm just, I'm excited to hear the perspectives of my fellow Councilors now that we've all had a few weeks to digest this and to think about the amendments that President Morell and former Councilor Knight made during our first meeting on the topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=413.006s">So</a>  I do have some proposals to bring to our discussion tonight, but I'll hold those until we hear from, you know, some of my fellow Councilors and others in the space. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=421.128s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=427.932s">Councilor</a>  Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=429.093s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=431.174s">As</a>  I said at the meeting in December, there's a lot about this proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=439.059s">At</a>  the very least, the core of this proposal, I very much agree with the principles behind it, the principles of parity, equity, the experience that <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=446.684s">The</a>  experience and time that the school committee puts into their work vis-a-vis compared to ours, and especially this idea of giving folks a chance to take part in running for and serving on the school committee, not just because of the money itself, but <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=461.901s">because</a>  it makes, not because of the money itself, but because it makes doing school can be a justifiable decision economically. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=473.145s">I</a>  think it pays attention to economic realities. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=475.786s">I</a>  said at that meeting, however, that we needed to talk through the details that, you know, I really appreciated former President Morales. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=486.009s">amendments</a>  to have us look at amounts and timing. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=490.332s">And</a>  in that spirit, I've collected some data, and in talking to folks, put together a range of different proposals as to different amounts that we could arrive at. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=501.62s">I</a>  sent the chart over to President Bears, if he can show it on the screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=508.745s">And</a>  we've also have printed copies for all the Councilors here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=534.721s">Thank</a>  you, President Ferris. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=536.363s">I</a>  know the text is a little small. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=541.411s">I'll</a>  read out the most important numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=543.534s">But</a>  essentially, this is a <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=547.242s">a</a>  listing of four alternative proposals for the school committee pay increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=554.728s">Now,</a>  I think it's really important to underscore that we're looking at a current pay of about $12,000 a year, which has not gone up since the year 2000. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=565.757s">And</a>  so the very first column is just the fiscal years. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=572.643s">The</a>  second and third columns are basically, historically, the school committee pay versus the city council member pay, which was brought up at the last meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=583.249s">Now,</a>  as you can see, the city council pay in the year 2000 was about $13,785. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=593.574s">compared</a>  to $12,000 for school committee members. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=597.878s">And</a>  over time, that disparity has grown. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=600.64s">And</a>  that was a big kind of topic of discussion at our last meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=605.472s">The</a>  first proposal is just simply following the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=609.093s">So</a>  this first proposal is different from what was on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=612.994s">The</a>  first proposal is following the percentage increases that the city council received in those years. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=620.776s">And</a>  so what I did was got the data for all the years, went through year by year, looked at the percentage increase, the percentage change, and then did calculations from the starting point of 12,000 off that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=635.299s">which</a>  would land us at approximately $25,000 and 500, a little bit over that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=639.16s">Now,</a>  the average annual percent change with that would be 3.3% compounded. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=642.561s">The</a>  total percent change is about 130%. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=644.302s">So</a>  that's if we follow the city council pay increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=660.031s">The</a>  third set of numbers is, so basically I went and requested the teacher contracts, the MTA contracts, and in talking to some teachers, this was an idea that came up was if we, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=678.26s">the</a>  school committee pay increase should look somewhat like more akin to what teachers see. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=685.064s">And</a>  so with that proposal, again, went through the years, did all the calculations, you end up at $22,000, 100, or $22,000, or 22,000, sorry, I'm too tired, $22,105.60. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=704.105s">So</a>  that's using what the numbers I found in the teacher contracts. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=709.809s">Now,</a>  obviously there's some nuance to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=711.97s">I</a>  know a school committee member put out a post talking about how we look at those numbers and how we calculate and how steps work, but this is just kind of a neutral setting. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=724.378s">I</a>  also collected the numbers for the flat 2% cost of living adjustment. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=729.949s">which</a>  would basically have us end up at $19,687.27. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=733.252s">So</a>  about $2,500 lower. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=748.28s">I</a>  was also curious about inflation and what that $12,000 would look like if we use the Department of Labor's data on the change in the consumer price index in Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=761.856s">And</a>  it actually ends up very, very, very close to the Medford Teachers Association cost of living adjustments, actually just off by $3.30. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=772.747s">And</a>  so that would basically have us end up at $22,108.69. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=784.259s">Um,</a>  there's some numbers at the bottom for different, um, different positions, chair, secretary, vice chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=790.901s">But,</a>  um, I think for the sake of this discussion, um, I think the focus should be on just the normal school committee members pay and then we can get to get those positions as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=803.405s">Um,</a>  just some food for thought, some ideas, some different ideas, um, some alternate, uh, alternate proposals to consider.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=816.531s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=817.432s">Anything</a>  else, Councilor Tseng? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=822.736s">Any</a>  councillors like to speak at this time? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=828.039s">Councilor</a>  Callahan?</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=832.026s">As</a>  a new city councillor, I would love to ask how this discussion is going to proceed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=838.748s">So</a>  it sounds like my understanding was that there were going to be some proposals that would change either the number or the start date or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=847.91s">Are</a>  there any proposals to do that, or is this simply discussing the original?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=853.732s">At</a>  this point, councillors can either make statements or they can make motions to amend the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=865.216s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli, then Councilor Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=867.097s">I</a>  think I saw your hand, Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=868.738s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=871.879s">I</a>  think I was pretty clear at our last meeting that where I stood on this topic, I think that there are so many factors to look at this, but looking at this is more prudent and realistic. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=889.878s">process,</a>  when we look in the basic sense of the perfect world, this would be easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=899.645s">If</a>  we had unlimited funds, then we would do what we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=905.53s">But</a>  unfortunately, we're talking about a school system that right now <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=910.649s">Today</a>  is drastically underfunded. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=912.97s">And</a>  when it comes to next year's fiscal budget, we're gonna be talking about some pretty difficult decisions to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=920.033s">And</a>  those decisions are gonna be, gee, can we afford a language teacher, a foreign language teacher in the middle schools? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=929.017s">Where</a>  could we find 45, $55,000? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=930.018s">I</a>  know we could find it right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=936.112s">Let's</a>  look at the conversations. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=939.734s">Well,</a>  how do we fund these clubs? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=942.236s">All</a>  these great clubs that we started, these small stipend clubs that teachers do it for service for their children in the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=951.822s">How</a>  do we fund those? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=952.702s">Because</a>  they're gonna be on the chopping block. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=954.903s">They're</a>  gonna be cut. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=957.305s">And</a>  the question is gonna be, where do we find $36,000? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=959.066s">Right</a>  here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=964.008s">If</a>  you listen to my council colleagues, I appreciate the hard work you did, but where was this math when paraprofessionals and teachers are negotiating? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=973.452s">This</a>  is, this perception's reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=977.934s">And</a>  I think that it was brought up at the meeting when, I've had a thousand phone calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=982.655s">I</a>  think I've shared it with you people. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=984.016s">And</a>  I want you guys to understand that <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=987.358s">I</a>  will share what they've said to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=989.779s">The</a>  perception of reality that when you have an organization running for office in the city, and they run in a slate, and that slate goes on a gigantic picture all over the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1000.12s">And</a>  then as soon as the election is completed, then the word goes out that that organization is now going to support each other to raising funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1010.329s">So</a>  that's a glaring question. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1012.391s">Whether</a>  it's true or not, that's not what I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1015.894s">It's</a>  the perception of what we're trying to do here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1018.937s">Now,</a>  I've gotten a message from different members of past school committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1024.618s">I've</a>  gotten messages from present school committee members. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1027.679s">And</a>  the idea of saying, this is equitable, what we do is no different. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1032.48s">Absolutely,</a>  it's different. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1035.06s">Absolutely,</a>  it's different. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1036.18s">And</a>  no one can tell me otherwise, because I'm the only one here that has done both. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1041.561s">And</a>  I will tell you that this position <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1046.84s">has</a>  way more pressures. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1049.782s">We</a>  have way more work to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1053.584s">Every</a>  single day. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1055.425s">Now,</a>  when you think about it, what is the school committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1058.907s">The</a>  school committee is a policy making authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1062.188s">They</a>  set policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1064.75s">They</a>  set policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1066.691s">They</a>  have a superintendent that does all the work, that sets everything in motion to what the vision of this school is. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1077.87s">Is</a>  it working? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1078.971s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1079.431s">That's</a>  still out for debate. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1081.792s">But</a>  the question that I have is understanding this process today and what they're asking for today. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1088.395s">And</a>  I shared it with my colleagues today, tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1092.697s">It's</a>  very simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1093.737s">If</a>  the community didn't want this, well, you should have come out to vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1098.619s">Because</a>  there are six people from one side and one from another. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1103.359s">And</a>  the philosophy is very simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1105.321s">This</a>  is just common sense philosophy of doing the right thing today. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1109.604s">Until</a>  we have a better understanding of what our fiscal responsibilities are when it comes to the budget, we should not look at any increases like this at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1119.552s">It's</a>  borderline dangerous because what's next? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1125.937s">When</a>  I joined the school committee, it was a service-based <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1129.46s">opportunity.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1130.941s">It</a>  was for me to work and give back to my community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1134.924s">And</a>  to hear the responses, but we'll get better candidates if we get paid more. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1140.168s">Here's</a>  a here's a lightning rod to everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1143.19s">We</a>  make $28,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1143.891s">I'm</a>  not I'm not I'm not getting rich over $28,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1148.854s">So</a>  if the fantasy is a school kid member sending me messages saying that <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1153.223s">Well,</a>  it'll bring in better candidates. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1155.865s">I've</a>  worked on a school committee with great candidates. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1158.426s">I've</a>  worked for school committee members that we couldn't shine their shoes and how dedicated they were. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1167.472s">And</a>  they weren't getting a penny. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1169.753s">It</a>  was a volunteer basic process. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1173.335s">Neighborhood</a>  communities, because I did some homework too. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1177.833s">What</a>  we're asking for here is an absolute disgrace to what neighboring communities just around us get. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1184.879s">Some</a>  of those are the highest, and I think that they're bordering between $16,000 and $18,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1188.101s">That's</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1190.604s">Everybody</a>  else. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1191.224s">There</a>  are some communities that, when I brought it up, they were like, what? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1194.727s">Are</a>  you crazy? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1197.95s">To</a>  equate it as the same responsibility as what we do here is different. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1203.494s">It's</a>  not the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1205.135s">It</a>  isn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1209.614s">It</a>  just looks and it feels funny. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1213.517s">I</a>  look at the situation that we're in tonight, when we're bringing this up, and we understand the voting process now. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1219.941s">And</a>  I know some of the council wanna know where we're gonna go next with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1223.844s">And</a>  I think that, you know, is there something that we can do? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1227.727s">Yeah,</a>  you hear that the equity piece is being thrown around. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1232.87s">If</a>  that's the biggest issue, then let's correct it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1236.707s">If</a>  we make 28 and they make 12, well then why don't we all pull together, not jeopardize the funding mechanism, what we don't have at the high school right now and drop our pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1251.574s">And</a>  I don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1253.055s">I</a>  don't do it for applause or social media comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1255.996s">I'm</a>  dead serious. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1257.376s">When</a>  I started in 2008, when I ran for office, I did it because I wanted to give back to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1262.918s">And</a>  you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1264.018s">I've</a>  stood in there, I've stuck in there pretty long. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1266.538s">I've</a>  learned a lot and I've done a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1268.219s">I'm</a>  pretty satisfied that my legacy, that what I put forth to this community is something strong that my kids will look at and say, well, my dad was part of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1278.962s">And</a>  that's what it's all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1280.99s">If</a>  you're doing this, we're doing this for the money, we're in big trouble. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1286.274s">Because</a>  if that's a reality of what this body thinks of what is a successful financial situation in your homes, this isn't it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1296.842s">So</a>  I truly, I would make the motion that we look at all of our salaries and become equitable by dropping our salaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1306.409s">Because</a>  if the city council school committee, if that's the biggest issue, then let's do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1311.647s">This</a>  isn't something I'm not listen, it's not going to make or break me. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1316.729s">And</a>  I tell people it's just 8000 less than I'd have to donate. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1320.911s">And</a>  I'm sure all of you feel the same way. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1322.452s">I</a>  don't think anybody here if you've been here for a while, have seen where your money goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1326.133s">Your</a>  money doesn't go to fancy cars, doesn't go to fancy houses. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1330.095s">It</a>  usually goes back to the people that helped you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1335.063s">And</a>  that's what we're all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1337.024s">So</a>  when we sit here and talk about 100 and whatever percent raise increase, I think it's disingenuine. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1343.529s">And</a>  to be honest with you, I think it's a slap in the face for the people that are really having a very difficult time right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1350.273s">The</a>  morale in the school department is still terrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1353.356s">It's</a>  still terrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1356.398s">Our</a>  scores are very low. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1358.663s">You</a>  know, we're in flux in many different areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1363.427s">Our</a>  school facilities look terrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1366.589s">Our</a>  custodians still don't have, if they've settled a contract, it's gonna be lower than ever, or they haven't either. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1373.735s">So</a>  you still have unions out there that work every single day, that are doing the dirtiest, most disgusting work in the city, and with a smile on their face, picking up kids and hugging them after they vomit all over them. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1387.657s">But</a>  at the same time, oh, people are gonna offend that I said that, but by the way, kids vomit. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1392.962s">So</a>  we shouldn't be offended by that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1396.184s">Because,</a>  and this is funny, because the other piece of this is, I've heard from teachers, I've heard from teachers, qualified, respected, long-term educators in our system, that have been absolutely torn down <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1414.707s">by</a>  administrators and school kid members because they've come to that podium and raised an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1421.252s">That's</a>  a disgrace. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1423.434s">This</a>  is their podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1425.836s">They're</a>  taking care of our children, whether they live in Medford or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1428.798s">They're</a>  more of this community than most people. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1433.242s">So</a>  listen, we realize, and I think everybody has to realize this, the vote's gonna be the vote, and we have to move on. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1440.648s">But</a>  I think, in good faith, <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1443.806s">this</a>  council can work together to show the community, can we be responsible? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1448.792s">Can</a>  we send the right message? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1450.714s">And</a>  is the right message to give an increase at this amount? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1454.118s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1455.339s">Do</a>  I think that that <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1458.058s">and</a>  in reality of life that we haven't touched there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1461.181s">They</a>  haven't, the school committee hasn't gotten an increase since I believe, yeah, I was there in 2008 and eight, six years before that, we didn't get that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1469.267s">But</a>  I tell you what, George Scarpelli didn't care. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1471.969s">Ann</a>  Marie Cuno didn't care. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1473.451s">Paulette</a>  Van der Kloot didn't care. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1475.112s">Billy</a>  O'Keefe didn't care. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1476.653s">John</a>  Falco didn't care. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1478.515s">Mayor</a>  Michael J. McGlynn didn't care. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1480.396s">We</a>  went to work every day for our city and we did a lot of great things. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1485.046s">So</a>  be careful what we do, because once we open this can, guess what's going to happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1489.65s">Do</a>  you know how many committees, commissions we have in this city? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1494.734s">What's</a>  to say we can't look at what they're doing and saying, well, we've got to compensate them now. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1500.278s">So</a>  careful of what we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1503.18s">If</a>  we, like I said, if we had an abundance of funds, then maybe we can look at and working it together and try to build it up slowly. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1511.527s">When</a>  we're talking about, and we all heard it, everybody heard it, let's all be realist here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1516.59s">The</a>  next year's budget, when we sit together, when we lose ESSER money, and we look at what the ARPA money we've lost, and we look at the positions that those funds hold for us, we're gonna be in deep, deep trouble. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1531.553s">And</a>  I'm gonna tell you, I'm like, listen, I've only, I know I could speak, but I've told you guys, I've really pushed in things that I've seen just by being part of this community for so long. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1546.103s">You</a>  saw how it worked with the city solicitors. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1549.005s">You</a>  saw how it worked with the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1551.987s">It's</a>  just not equitable. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1553.868s">Be</a>  smart, be prudent, and use common sense with these issues when I say, <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1561.383s">Maybe</a>  it's not fair, but they ran. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1565.447s">They</a>  ran for office at $12,000 as a payee. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1569.171s">That's</a>  what they ran for. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1572.134s">So</a>  that's what they should have until we make sure we know what our fiscal future looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1579.482s">Please.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1580.263s">That's</a>  all I ask this committee to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1584.62s">Councilor</a>  Callan asked a question that, where do we go from here? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1587.402s">What's</a>  the process? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1588.583s">I</a>  would hope this is still a feeling of process, because the truth of the matter is, when you have an employee, because that's what it seems like to me, when you have an employee that's come to you for a raise, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1599.411s">I'm</a>  assistant director of a program, and I've had employees come to me and say, George, I think I deserve a raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1604.875s">I</a>  said, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1606.937s">Let's</a>  sit down and talk about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1609.246s">Let's</a>  sit down at your body of work and let's sit down and talk about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1612.447s">Have</a>  any of you talked to any of the school kid members? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1615.728s">No,</a>  you've talked to all the school kid members. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1620.01s">Don't</a>  say it, careful, because you don't talk to all the school kid members. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1624.392s">Because</a>  if you really want to do some homework, you've talked to all the school kid members. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1629.874s">So</a>  my recommendation would be to have the school kid members here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1634.608s">and</a>  let's talk with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1636.53s">Because</a>  I think when you put it together and you understand, and maybe you sit and look at people eye to eye and you say, well, this is how it hurts. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1643.355s">Here's</a>  the reality of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1645.177s">The</a>  school committee knows how bad the budget is gonna be. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1647.899s">Let's</a>  be serious, they know. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1649.46s">So</a>  when you look in the school committee's eyes and say, okay, your child goes to the Brooks, your child has kindergarten AIDS. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1657.506s">With</a>  this increase, this could be the increase that avoids kindergarten AIDS next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1664.64s">That's</a>  what I'm trying to say because listen, I taught for 15 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1669.284s">I</a>  was on the school committee for eight years. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1671.566s">I've</a>  been on this committee for six years. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1674.169s">I</a>  understand how all the balls are being juggled right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1679.974s">So</a>  please don't make something that looks good on paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1683.257s">Have</a>  you make a decision because ultimately, the decisions we make tonight will affect what we do <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1691.664s">in</a>  June, in July, in August, and in September, more importantly, in such a negative manner that it will hurt us. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1701.328s">It</a>  will. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1702.068s">That's</a>  just the reality of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1703.969s">So</a>  thank you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1707.211s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1708.271s">Did</a>  I have Councilor Leming or is it Councilor Tseng? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1713.793s">Councilor</a>  Leming and Councilor Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1716.527s">I'd</a>  like to thank my colleague for his words. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1719.73s">I</a>  would tend to agree with him that the optics on this are terrible when teachers that are underpaid see the headline, politicians are looking to increase other politicians salaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1734.884s">morale</a>  is a real issue there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1737.487s">That</a>  and that is something that is really on my mind in this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1743.092s">Um,</a>  I personally would be more amenable to one of the, uh, to either, uh, the raised to something around 24 21,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1753.202s">Sorry,</a>  we're getting the wrong numbers on the, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1758.635s">basically</a>  the equivalent of cost of living adjustments over since fiscal year 2020 of 2 to 2.5%, which would be, I think that would be a little bit more reasonable and putting that adjustment over a period of several years in order to not strain the budget immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1779.27s">But</a>  that being said, so, <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1782.304s">The</a>  city council, the city council salaries are something that are make or break for a lot of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1789.232s">The</a>  city council right now is a majority is majority renter. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1793.617s">And</a>  so having that having <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1797.981s">the</a>  salary to be able to justify 20 plus hours of work that we put into this every week, I think, is fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1806.865s">When</a>  it comes to the school committee members, if they're putting in 20 plus hours a week, I think that in order to improve the school system, I think that a similar <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1817.79s">to</a>  be able to justify. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1818.25s">Similar</a>  compensation is fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1819.691s">We</a>  had a candidate this past time who was put it who was putting in shift work during a lot of the campaign working as a server and so having the having the salary to be able to justify the time that they put into that if we're going to expect them to put in. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1844.531s">There</a>  have been a lot of people, there are a lot of people in the city that Medford relies on who are volunteers. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1851.656s">We</a>  are, and Medford, they are the foundation of the city in a lot of ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1857.179s">Volunteerism</a>  is incredibly helpful for running the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1861.963s">It</a>  is foundational to Medford's functions. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1866.045s">But</a>  we, <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1877.048s">We</a>  can't expect to run essential functions on the back of volunteers. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1885.094s">There</a>  are people who would make great school committee members who would be willing to do it for free. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1890.758s">A</a>  lot of those people have been <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1894.142s">cornerstones</a>  of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1895.363s">A</a>  lot of them have come up against these raises, and there are a lot of people who would make great school committee members who would be completely unwilling to work for the current stipend. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1908.735s">And</a>  I think that being able to <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1913.799s">being</a>  able to raise the salaries by a certain amount would allow us to have more people at our disposal when it comes to running the school system.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1925.209s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1927.952s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1928.692s">I'm</a>  going to go to Councilor Tseng, Councilor Lazzaro, Vice President Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1931.955s">Councilor</a>  Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1932.896s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1937.759s">There</a>  are a lot of arguments that are, I think, fairly being raised, some that I don't disagree, that I don't agree as much with, but I still do believe that there's a lot of this that needs to be balanced. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1950.952s">And</a>  so I think Councilor Scarpelli's core ask, <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1954.395s">that</a>  we look at the timing so that we have a better picture of what things look like financially is not an unreasonable ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1964.685s">And</a>  that's why I would personally be in favor and I will motion <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1970.103s">later</a>  to have this, instead of having this be implemented immediately, have a proposal be implemented over the two years, which would give us time. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1985.256s">So</a>  basically, July 1st, 2024, July 1st, 2025. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1991.645s">This</a>  would basically give us time to go through the budget process to have a better picture of what things look like at the schools before we move forward with a proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2001.95s">In</a>  the first year, I don't think that we should do the full amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2006.852s">That's</a>  my take. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2007.953s">And</a>  so I would have this be spread over a few years as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2011.574s">And</a>  that will hopefully give us more time to solidify our understanding of the picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2017.317s">I</a>  have also taken time to talk to people with a better financial picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2022.54s">And</a>  the financial picture is nuanced. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2025.241s">It</a>  basically says that we have a small, small chunk of money that we can spend, but little consensus about what that money should be spent on. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2034.426s">And</a>  it's, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2036.868s">it</a>  would be more ideal to give people across the board raises, but it's not enough money to do that structurally. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2043.414s">And</a>  so the question is, what do we do with that surplus, with that tiny surplus? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2051.503s">So</a>  that's a consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2054.286s">Ultimately,</a>  I grew up close to my teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2059.851s">I</a>  ran for city council because during the pandemic, the school's budget got cut in real terms of close to 9%. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2072.64s">I</a>  fought hard for more money for our schools successfully, but we also have to be fair to all our staff, and that includes people who run the schools as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2084.607s">I</a>  think Councilor Leming makes a great point that I see in my real life. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2090.731s">When</a>  I say that this makes running for office justifiable, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2099.477s">I</a>  think the service argument is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2102.418s">But</a>  there are tons of people who want to serve, but can't because they have to put food on their table. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2109.34s">They</a>  have to pay their rents. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2111.7s">And</a>  so they ultimately don't make that choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2115.741s">Nat</a>  cited a <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2119.002s">an</a>  example here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2121.463s">But</a>  it's a story that more often than not ends in people deciding not to run for office than to run for office. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2130.344s">With</a>  that being said, again, so in summary, I think we should discuss the phase-in over two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2137.926s">And</a>  I agree with Matt that I think we should end up around where the teachers end up. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2143.947s">I</a>  think that's only fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2144.887s">I</a>  think the logic is more sound. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2148.209s">the</a>  data is there, and so I believe that we should end up basically raising school committee pay to $22,105.60, which is basically the same increased rates as MTA cost leveling adjustments, phased over two years, going into effect July 1st of 2024 and July 1st of 2025. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2175.15s">It</a>  seems to me like the most reasonable approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2179.692s">It's</a>  a compromise that not many people are going to be happy with, but that's the nature of compromises, and I think everyone can find some progress in that deal being made. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2190.818s">Um,</a>  and I think we should discuss that proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2195.14s">I</a>  think it's more palatable. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2197.401s">I</a>  think it gives us more room to, um, to look at our picture and look at what, um, what the picture looks like going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2207.206s">And</a>  I would be happy to motion now, but I am also happy to have a discussion first about it.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2215.911s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2216.151s">Answer</a>  saying Councilor Lazzaro.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2220.796s">Thank</a>  you and I appreciate everybody's flexibility with me being on zoom today. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2227.462s">There</a>  are just two things I wanted to mention. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2232.227s">This</a>  has been touched upon, but I think that the an important thing to acknowledge is that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2239.594s">Many</a>  of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2241.114s">Well,</a>  I think all of us ran for office because of the value we have for the city and because we care a lot about our community, and because we have a certain level of love and care for our community members, but <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2259.648s">If</a>  these positions are all volunteer positions, it requires people to have enough personal income to not require an additional income source. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2271.412s">And</a>  that requires a baseline level of income. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2276.334s">And</a>  I don't think that's representative of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2279.235s">And</a>  I think we should just consider that one aspect of making sure that we're really <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2286.718s">having</a>  people representing the city that that truly represent the people that live here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2291.744s">The</a>  second thing I want to make note of is that just because other communities other surrounding communities are not paying their school committee members the same as they're paying their city Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2303.337s">And</a>  I would respectfully disagree with Councilor Scarpelli I worked as the executive assistant to Superintendent Edouard-Vincent for a few years and with not this current city council but a city council a couple of years ago, that was made up of many of the same folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2321.574s">And</a>  they work a tremendous amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2323.676s">They</a>  were incredibly hardworking. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2325.977s">I</a>  can tell you because I had to go to all the meetings, and it was a lot of meetings, and there are a lot of subcommittees and Committee of the Whole meetings every week. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2334.443s">So</a>  it's, they're very hardworking. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2337.685s">I'm</a>  not sure how it was when Councilor Scarpelli was on the school committee, but <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2342.789s">I</a>  will say that just because other communities aren't maybe necessarily doing the right thing by paying their school committee members the same that they're paying their city councilors doesn't mean that we shouldn't do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2353.117s">I</a>  think being a leader in a group is a great thing to be and leading the way and saying, hey, these two bodies are <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2363.164s">equivalent</a>  in the accomplishments and the work that they're doing, and that's something that we're acknowledging and valuing, then I think that's something that we can stand up for.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2376.871s">I'll</a>  go to Councilor Scrivelly, but if we could keep it short.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2378.712s">To</a>  the personal privilege, just to Councilor Lazzaro, when you use a person's name, and understanding what I did when I ran for office, and I was a school kid member, <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2391.735s">We</a>  worked our tail off. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2393.596s">We</a>  changed policies. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2395.277s">We</a>  put in bullying policies. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2397.539s">We</a>  made sure we had new science labs, new fields, new gymnasium, new curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2405.084s">So</a>  we worked our tails off. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2406.745s">And</a>  by the way, while this council was doing that, he owned a fence company. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2412.329s">He</a>  owned a painting company. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2414.431s">He</a>  worked as a coach. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2416.571s">and</a>  he worked as a full-time recreation assistant director. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2420.194s">So</a>  I completely understand how hard it is to want to be part of a position, but when you use the name like you did and understand, I don't know what you did or what school department you work for, but I made reference to the school committee, the teaching and the city council work that I've done in this community, in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2445.973s">So</a>  I appreciate that you have an overview of what happens in another- It was Medford, actually. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2453.776s">Well,</a>  in Medford, but I truly didn't even know you worked in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2459.598s">So</a>  thank you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2461.878s">We</a>  don't all know everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2462.759s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2463.939s">Councilor</a>  Collins.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2466.7s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2467.68s">I</a>  appreciate hearing from my fellow councilors about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2474.991s">A</a>  lot to respond to. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2475.932s">I</a>  already started out my comments with where I'm coming from in my overall approach to this issue, so I'll do my best not to reiterate myself because I don't want to bore you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2487.057s">I'm</a>  going to make a couple of proposals. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2490.599s">First,</a>  I do just want to, I do feel like it's important to emphasize this isn't about <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2499.226s">feel</a>  like this shouldn't be a controversial statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2501.008s">This</a>  isn't about this school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2502.769s">This</a>  is about the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2504.731s">Whoever</a>  is on it, any changes that we pass will be in effect. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2510.43s">into</a>  the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2511.951s">What,</a>  speaking only for myself, what we'll be voting on, I would vote on regardless of who was in those chairs, because I think that, and it was mentioned also tonight, compensation, the need to, sometimes it comes up, we discuss how should volunteers be compensated? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2526.576s">Should</a>  we compensate volunteers? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2528.416s">How</a>  should boards and commissions be compensated? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2530.157s">I</a>  have been a little bit obnoxious in saying whenever it comes up, I believe that we should compensate members of all boards and commissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2536.379s">I</a>  just bring that up to say, I think it's, <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2539.974s">It's</a>  really understandable that these conversations get personal. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2542.619s">For</a>  me, this is not personal. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2543.6s">This</a>  is about how I think this body should be compensated. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2551.514s">Moving</a>  on from that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2554.729s">I</a>  appreciate Councilor Tseng's motion to raise.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2559.892s">It</a>  wasn't a formal motion.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2560.872s">It</a>  wasn't a formal motion, a bit of a hint of motion, pre-motion perhaps. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2565.634s">I</a>  appreciate Councilor Tseng's idea around raising school committee compensation to follow the same year over year percentage increases that have occurred in the MTA contract from the numbers that we received, which would arrive at that <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2583.746s">$22,105.60</a>  number in the year 2025. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2593.021s">If</a>  you make that in the form of the motion, I am happy to support that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2596.923s">I</a>  like that for a couple of reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2598.863s">One,</a>  I've made it clear I'd like to support a proposal for a school committee compensation increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2605.346s">I've</a>  been clear about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2607.347s">I</a>  think anything that we do at this point, I think it makes a lot of sense for it to be not effective immediately, but go into effect at the start of the next fiscal year and be phased in in accordance with the start of future fiscal years. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2619.761s">If</a>  you make that in the form of the motion, I will support that tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2622.904s">However,</a>  I have also been clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2626.227s">We</a>  are a legislative body. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2627.688s">We</a>  make policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2628.509s">School</a>  committee is a legislative body. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2631.171s">They</a>  make policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2632.232s">I</a>  don't feel comfortable as one Councilor Tseng that I know our job to be more substantial or more work than theirs because I frankly haven't seen evidence of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2641.724s">So</a>  I would also like to make the proposal in the form of a motion that school committee compensation be raised over the period of four years to be leveled to city council pay, July 1, 2024 through July 1, 2027, first two years meeting parity with that MTA contract line number, and then closing the gap in 2026 and 2027.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2669.633s">Is</a>  that a formal motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2670.574s">There's</a>  been a lot of conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2671.434s">Is</a>  that a motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2672.054s">You've</a>  just made a motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2673.355s">Is</a>  there a second to that motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2675.877s">So,</a>  conversation's over. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2678.278s">No,</a>  there's plenty of time for more motions, and we'll take them in the order that they were made, and then we'll have public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2685.963s">Is</a>  there a second on the motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2686.823s">I'll</a>  second. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2687.504s">There's</a>  a second from Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2688.884s">I</a>  will go to Councilor Callahan, then Councilor Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2690.825s">Whew,</a>  wow, so much to say about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2699.076s">First,</a>  I want to say that a number of years ago, the Somerville School Committee, the paraprofessionals were asking to have their salaries raised to, I think it was $25,000 a year, which I can tell you in Somerville, nor here is a living wage. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2714.89s">I</a>  was outraged that the school committee was like, nope, flat out. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2722.125s">wouldn't</a>  do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2724.006s">And</a>  one of the reasons that they gave was that they were talking to other school committees and the other school committees from other cities didn't want Somerville to raise the wage because, oh no, then it would mean that they would be under pressure to raise the wage. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2739.393s">And</a>  I said right there that it was my, I was incredibly disappointed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2745.635s">They</a>  should be proud to be the first city to do the right thing for the paraprofessionals. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2754.167s">right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2754.888s">So,</a>  and I want to start off by saying how much I believe that our paraprofessionals, especially, but also our teachers are underpaid for the work that they do, how incredibly important that work is. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2770.643s">You</a>  know, I'm boggled by the types of industries that get paid twice as much as teachers, genuinely. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2778.89s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2780.31s">That</a>  is very important to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2781.751s">And</a>  I think, unfortunately, the only way that we are going to get the things that we care about in this city to be properly funded is to increase the total budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2791.219s">Because</a>  we're not going to steal from affordable housing stuff to pay the teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2795.202s">We're</a>  not going to steal from the teachers to pay for putting us in line with our climate change goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2802.227s">We're</a>  not going to pay for those. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2803.868s">We're</a>  not going to steal from one thing to pay for another. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2805.79s">Our</a>  roads, everything is underfunded. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2809.551s">We</a>  are wildly underfunded in Medford and we have to solve that problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2814.152s">So</a>  I wanna make sure that we don't come into these detailed arguments that are like, oh, well, we can't spend this $60,000 this way because it's gonna come back and fight and compete with the other 70 things that we could spend $60,000 on, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2835.039s">So</a>  I wanna talk a little bit about <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2838.971s">the</a>  value of having a genuine democracy, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2843.734s">I</a>  truly believe, and this is something I've spent like seven years working with experts on, studying, training people around the country in how to get a better democracy. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2853.0s">It's</a>  very important to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2855.081s">I</a>  know a fair amount about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2856.642s">So</a>  when we talk about getting better representation or good representation on a city council or on a school committee, it is not about getting people who are dedicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2866.283s">It</a>  is about getting people who genuinely not only represent but vote in favor of policies that even the scales. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2875.728s">Our</a>  government in America at all levels <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2879.955s">overly</a>  supports and overly serves people who are wealthy, people who own property, people who are white collar, people who have white collar jobs, people who are overly educated, people who are white. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2898.742s">And</a>  when we talk about having a better democracy, it isn't about getting people who are dedicated.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2906.462s">Councilor</a>  Callahan, just if you could, if you could direct your comments to me and make sure you're speaking into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2911.507s">You're</a>  fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2911.767s">Yes,</a>  I apologize.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2912.168s">New</a>  city councilor, you gotta correct me on these things.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2915.191s">You</a>  know, you're good, and I made a lot of mistakes. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2917.253s">Not</a>  that it was a mistake, but I was corrected many times by Councilor Tarapelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2920.896s">Wonderful.</a> </p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2921.717s">Great,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2924.693s">So</a>  having run workshops around the country for many years and having, in these workshops, to create these workshops, I studied with experts, mostly in democracy and specifically in democracy at the local level. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2938.984s">So</a>  city councils, town councils, more city councils than anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2943.148s">And</a>  I'm just gonna, I pulled up here something that was from one of my workshops so that people understand that this is in, <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2952.535s">like</a>  a sphere of things you can do to structurally have a better democracy and better meaning we're not only representing home owning wealthy white people in your city. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2967.492s">that</a>  you are properly representing the people who earn less than 50% of, you know, half the people in the city earn less than 50% of the average wage. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2976.516s">Okay,</a>  that's the way it works. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2979.597s">So</a>  things that you can do to make your city be better represented. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2985.639s">are</a>  public financing of elections, having district awards, making sure you have vote-by-mail or early voting. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2990.54s">I'm</a>  not going to read all of these. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2991.381s">There's</a>  like two dozen of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2993.721s">Are</a>  your elections on paper ballots? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2995.202s">Is</a>  there a hand-counted audit of at least 1%? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2997.522s">And</a>  are your elected officials paid a living wage? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3000.363s">So</a>  the problem with this idea that it should be a volunteer effort is that there are lots of people, mostly people who earn less than 50%, less than the average wage in your city. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3014.875s">that</a>  they just can't volunteer 20 hours a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3018.757s">Neither</a>  they nor their spouse earns enough money that they are able to spend time with their families and live a decent life and pay their bills, their rent, or their groceries, or whatever it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3032.686s">It's</a>  not about them not being dedicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3041.513s">do</a>  the job if it doesn't pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3044.395s">And</a>  I'm going to say, I don't think any of us on the city council, and I don't want to speak for other people, but in most cities, no one on the city council and no one on the school committee falls into those categories. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3059.564s">And</a>  that's why these people are underrepresented. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3061.745s">So</a>  I care a lot about democracy. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3063.867s">And</a>  I genuinely believe that the right thing to do <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3067.905s">is</a>  to increase the pay of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3071.266s">Now,</a>  that doesn't mean, that being said, right, I also believe that as a city, as an elected city councilor, it is my style to make a bunch of, to be able to pass a lot of things that materially help people. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3090.612s">Fix</a>  the roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3093.748s">make</a>  sure all of our positions in the school are properly, that we have people who are second language teachers, that we have after school programs for everyone, that we have these things before we do anything that is either for ourselves or cultural. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3111.747s">That</a>  is my style. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3113.369s">So</a>  I feel incredibly uncomfortable voting on this as the very first thing that comes up in my term as a city councilor, because that is not the way that I want to serve. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3125.78s">That</a>  is not the way that I want to serve. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3129.103s">But</a>  I want people to understand that my viewpoint on this is not something that I come to in the last month because this <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3137.196s">particular</a>  issue came about. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3139.078s">This</a>  is a viewpoint that I have held for many years, having worked with many experts on how to get your city to properly serve the underserved, which includes the paraprofessionals and the teachers and the other union workers who work here for the city or in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3157.759s">Those</a>  are incredibly important to me, and it's important to me that we serve those people first before we serve ourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3163.622s">But</a>  it is important because the only way you can sustain a city council or a school committee that makes those right decisions is by paying a little bit more so that we can have people on those bodies who come from those backgrounds and not just people who want to <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3186.57s">to</a>  hope to serve those people, but never actually talk to them because we all live in our own bubbles. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3191.432s">Okay,</a>  stop there.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3192.953s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3194.294s">Councilor</a>  Tseng, um, I think, Oh, given given the fact that Councilor Collins made a motion, I also just wanted to make a motion to <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3208.083s">to</a>  basically do the MTA, to have the cost of living adjustment reflect the MTA raised over those years. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3217.272s">Over</a>  which years? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3218.112s">Yeah,</a>  do you want formal language? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3219.854s">Over</a>  which years, sorry? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3221.796s">From</a>  fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2025. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3226.48s">Right,</a>  and then over how long?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3230.504s">Over</a>  those years. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3232.805s">Sorry,</a>  it would go up, but what would be the effective date?</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3235.747s">Oh,</a>  to have it go to $17,000 by July 1st, 2024, and up to $22,105.60 by July 1st, 2025. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3238.528s">Okay,</a>  so it would be the 24 and 25. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3240.409s">Right,</a>  it would be that one.</p>

    <p>[RhUNhYl62Oo_SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3257.372s">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3257.792s">Sorry,</a>  I misunderstood your question. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3259.393s">That's</a>  fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3264.217s">Again,</a>  this is all about balance. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3265.778s">This</a>  is not a proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3268.6s">This</a>  motion is not a proposal that was put out in the first place by either side of this argument, but I think it's <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3278.593s">As</a>  I told people coming into this meeting, I think this meeting is about finding a reasonable compromise. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3284.403s">And</a>  I believe that motion brings us there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3288.509s">And</a>  I believe very strongly that we should <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3291.621s">take</a>  advantage of this opportunity to set a precedent and to ensure that rising tides actually lifts all boats and lifts all boats into the future and that we can hold ourselves to account with that statement as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3306.032s">I</a>  believe that this specific proposal with the MTA cost of living adjustment rates brings us most closest to that idea.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3319.994s">There's</a>  a motion from Councilor Tseng to increase school committee pay based on the pay scale we discussed be around 17,000 July 1 2024 and 22,000 July 1 2025. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3328.2s">Is</a>  there a second on that motion, second, second Councilor Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3338.361s">there</a>  was a bunch of conversation, and I'm gonna take it in order, and I'm gonna go to Councilor Collins first, and then I'll go to Councilor Callahan, and then maybe Councilor Scarpelli, or if there are others. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3348.324s">There</a>  was a bunch of conversation before formal motions were made to make motions, and I wanna take the time to ensure that all motions are before us, before we go to public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3359.786s">So</a>  just if you had said something that you would like to be a formal motion, raise your hand and I will call on you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3364.648s">We'll</a>  start with Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3368.356s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3369.457s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3370.859s">Thank</a>  you for your deference, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3375.704s">So</a>  we have two proposals before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3378.808s">And</a>  again, I say this a lot, appreciate my fellow councilors comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3381.871s">This</a>  is a sticky subject. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3384.955s">I</a>  appreciate the conversation that we're able to have about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3388.323s">I</a>  know I've already put forth a proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3391.624s">Councilor</a>  Tseng has put forth another one that I also support. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3395.386s">I</a>  don't know which of these will advance. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3398.186s">Coming</a>  into this meeting, I know what I want to see is some increase for school committee members, and I would also like to see us create some sort of mechanism for regularly evaluating and updating and increasing <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3413.135s">school</a>  committee compensation and that of all elected officials in a regularized way. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3418.879s">Maybe</a>  it's an automatic COLA increase, but I think one of the things that has made this conversation very difficult is that talking about school committee pay at all is an entirely discretionary conversation for the city council to bring up. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3436.381s">And</a>  so it's been 23 years since we have, since I think it's been very murky, who controls that and why and how does it get brought up? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3442.926s">And</a>  I think that that's just been a disservice to the conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3447.79s">All</a>  that to say, I don't know which of, if either of the two proposals that have currently been proposed will go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3454.675s">I'd</a>  like to propose a third towards that goal of setting some sort of creating some kind of mechanism for us to revisit this more than once every 23 years when everybody thinks of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3465.743s">The</a>  motion would be for this council to refer this paper to the governance committee for consideration during charter review with the goal of creating a mechanism within the updated city charter to trigger automatic COLA increases and or compensation review for all elected positions at regular interviews. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3487.482s">And</a>  I can forward that language to you, Mr. Clerk, if you like. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3492.403s">And</a>  just to reiterate, the goal here is to come out of this with some sort of mechanism for looking at elected compensation so that it doesn't fall by the wayside for 23 years, because I think that that is one of the ingredients in this scenario when we haven't talked about it in a couple decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3507.796s">And</a>  so when we do, one of the things we contemplate is a triple digit percentage increase because it's just been so long since we talked about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3517.998s">Thank</a>  you, that's my motion.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3519.039s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Collins to refer a paper to the Governance Committee for consideration during charter review, and I'll paraphrase, I think it's to create a mechanism for review of compensation of elected officials. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3531.826s">We'll</a>  get the specific language and we'll read back all language before final motions and votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3536.068s">Is</a>  there a second on that motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3537.309s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3538.29s">Second,</a>  Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3540.691s">I'll</a>  go to Councilor Callahan and then Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3542.912s">Councilor</a>  Callahan.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3545.302s">I</a>  was only going to ask for the motions to be read more slowly before we vote.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3550.223s">Yeah,</a>  we're going to have to go back and get specific numeric and legal language when they're to be finally considered. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3555.385s">But</a>  I think we can put the substance on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3557.705s">We</a>  can do the detail work after we've had more discussion and participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3562.367s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli, your motions?</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3563.607s">Yeah,</a>  first, I think the point of information is for clarity purposes, Council President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3568.288s">We're</a>  not, as we move forward, we're not tying in <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3571.71s">the</a>  increase if this passes with the school committee, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3575.193s">It's</a>  not, it's not, it wouldn't be voted by the school committee because in essence that would be a conflict of interest, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3581.478s">It</a>  would be something that if we do, if we do vote yes to this, that the increase would have to come from the council every year after that or put into place now. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3592.758s">at</a>  that time, because I think it's a conflict of interest if we're having the school committee voting on something that's going to be on the same line as the teacher's contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3601.143s">That's</a>  a confusion. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3602.304s">That's</a>  all I want to clarify.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3603.264s">Yeah,</a>  no, and that's where we're going to get the specific language. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3605.846s">I</a>  do not care. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3607.246s">What,</a>  pursuant to the legal opinion, <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3610.814s">The</a>  school committee cannot vote to adjust its compensation. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3613.276s">Only</a>  the council can vote to adjust its compensation. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3615.498s">There</a>  are other laws governing the council, like we could not vote our own compensation in the term in which we're elected. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3621.022s">There's</a>  different laws that govern our compensation. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3623.584s">This</a>  would not tie it into the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3626.886s">There</a>  would be specific numbers effective on specific dates. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3630.188s">And</a>  once those were in effect, let's say that the proposal for <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3635.532s">an</a>  increase in 2024 and 2025, there would have to be a new vote after 2025 from the council pursuant to this general law.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3644.178s">Thank</a>  you for that, Claire. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3644.999s">Yes,</a>  absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3646.86s">My</a>  motion would be that the City Council lower their rate of pay <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3654.566s">the</a>  school board. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3655.286s">To</a>  uh, equitable rate for the school committee and then follow Council sayings or, uh, process of compensation moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3665.35s">I</a>  think that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3666.97s">With</a>  the. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3668.43s">With</a>  the, uh. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3670.751s">The</a>  fiscal <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3681.391s">our</a>  concerns and issues from all sides to be on level playing field. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3686.115s">And</a>  that's not a political ploy. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3688.697s">This</a>  is something that I feel strongly about, that if this is a wrong and we wanna make it right, let's make it right. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3695.142s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3696.523s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3697.844s">Give</a>  me one second. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3705.83s">Let</a>  me, I think it's a motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3708.686s">for</a>  the council to lower its own rate of pay to the school committee rate and then increase that rate of pay based on the motion by Councilor Tseng which is based on the percentage increase for the MTA contract from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 25. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3724.272s">That's</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3725.012s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3726.253s">Is</a>  there a second on that motion?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3733.195s">It's</a>  gonna be a difficult two years, isn't it everybody?</p>

    <p>[U1EIl_L-LWc_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3739.065s">All</a>  right, can I ask for some clarification on that?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3744.891s">Yes,</a>  Councilor Lazzaro, what's the question?</p>

    <p>[U1EIl_L-LWc_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3746.592s">Can</a>  you clarify the dollar amounts?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3748.694s">Could</a>  you repeat that, sorry?</p>

    <p>[U1EIl_L-LWc_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3752.158s">Can</a>  you clarify the dollar amounts that that would be?</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3754.139s">Can</a>  you clarify the dollar amounts?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3760.666s">For</a>  Councilor Scarpelli's resolution? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3762.628s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3764.461s">Um,</a>  best that I can tell it would be blended rate that it's equitable for both parties. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3769.725s">It</a>  would be to go down to 12,000 and then go up to no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3776.631s">It</a>  was 17 and then to 22.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3778.932s">No,</a>  it would be taking our salaries, pulling together an all-stop level playing field, roughly 20,000, whatever the math comes up and then go up and then go up with what the process would be.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3789.281s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3791.75s">It</a>  sounds like it would be that we would all be around 20,000 and then it would go up at least to the 22,000 over the next two years.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3799.337s">I'd</a>  be happy to second this. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3800.458s">I</a>  would like to see the, I think, I just think I would want to see some clarity on the numbers a little bit more.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3808.143s">Sorry,</a>  I couldn't hear that.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3809.224s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3809.684s">I'm</a>  not sure why my, my computer's being fussy. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3812.025s">I</a>  would be happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3812.725s">I</a>  would be happy to second this. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3814.626s">I</a>  would just want the numbers to be a little bit more clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3817.628s">Like,</a>  would we take all of the dollar amounts of the city council salaries and the dollar amounts of the school committee salaries, even them all out for this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3827.112s">And</a>  then for next year and the year after and like, and then have them all be the same, but raise them up to the level of. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3833.797s">whatever</a>  it would land at with uh Councilor sang's final level and then we everybody would be even yeah i mean that sounds like the idea given i do not know that we can legally do that and even if we were to do that the money would not be in the schools because they're two different budgets right okay so this is my this is my hesitation i really like the idea though</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3859.588s">Thanks,</a>  buddy. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3864.011s">I'm</a>  more concerned that I don't know that we can legally take that vote, and I don't have the legal authority on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3871.096s">Where's</a>  Adam? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3872.337s">He</a>  appears from his file cabinet. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3877.581s">All</a>  right, so there are four motions on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3879.763s">They've</a>  all been seconded. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3880.763s">There's</a>  a motion from Councilor Collins to use the MTA pay scale <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3887.025s">the</a>  COLAs over the last 25 fiscal years to increase school committee pay on July 1, 2024 and July 1, 2025, and then to also increase to equal pay to the current council salary July 1, 2026 and July 1, 2027, seconded by Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3906.288s">There's</a>  a motion by Councilor Tseng to increase using the COLAs of the MTA contracts on July 1, 2024 and July 1, 2025, <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3917.353s">There's</a>  a motion from Councilor Collins to refer a paper to the Governance Committee for consideration during charter review to create a mechanism for regular automatic review and adjustment of the compensation of all elected officials. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3928.22s">And</a>  there's a motion from Councilor Scarpelli for the council to lower its own rate of pay to the school committee to lower to even out the rate of pay <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3937.126s">between</a>  the council and the school committee take the total amount divided by the number of people serving and then to increase it based on the COLA schedule of the MTA contracts from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2025. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3948.711s">I</a>  believe those are the four motions on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3952.792s">at</a>  this time, unless there are further comments by members of the Council, I'll open the floor to public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3959.257s">Again,</a>  as we did last time, please, you can come up to the podium, make a line here, you can raise your hand on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3967.282s">I</a>  would ask that everyone please try to respect a three-minute time frame so that we can hear from everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3973.286s">And</a>  please keep your comments directed to the topic at hand and not make them personal. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3977.748s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Eleanor O'Leary]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3981.93s">Eleanor</a>  Brady O'Leary, 30 Norwich Circle, Secretary of the MTA, Teacher's Association, and a teacher in this school district for 33 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=3993.935s">What</a>  I want to say is what I heard during negotiations over and over and over. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4000.917s">And</a>  mind you, <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4002.62s">not</a>  when one single school committee member was sitting there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4007.203s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4008.303s">You</a>  cannot have that cola raised because we need to be fiscally responsible. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4014.487s">If</a>  we heard it once, we heard it 100 times, no matter what we asked for. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4021.351s">And</a>  I guess when I sit here and listen tonight for you to tell me that you are going to use our contract, full-time teachers, <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4032.202s">to</a>  pay part-time school committee members. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4035.824s">It</a>  is unheard of. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4038.566s">I'm</a>  appalled. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4041.067s">I</a>  stayed in this district for 33 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4044.309s">I</a>  was raised here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4045.47s">I</a>  went to school here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4046.891s">My</a>  father was a teacher here for 35 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4049.332s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4049.672s">Because</a>  we love this district. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4052.83s">But</a>  when I hear this stuff, it makes my blood boil. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4056.591s">Yes,</a>  I am retiring in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4059.192s">And</a>  you know something, we fought and we fought and we fought for a contract last, the past, how many years? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4066.214s">And</a>  I'm gonna tell you, a school committee member, one, showed up at one negotiation meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4075.076s">And</a>  I'm gonna tell you, I was at a negotiation meeting, I don't know, I'm surprised I'm not divorced. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4081.087s">But</a>  I would say five times a week, at least. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4086.05s">For</a>  nothing, no stipend. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4089.612s">Why</a>  were we on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4090.872s">We</a>  were on that to fight for what we believed in. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4094.014s">Where</a>  are the school committee members tonight fighting for what they want? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4098.597s">Why</a>  aren't they out there picketing like we did? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4102.079s">Why</a>  aren't they offered the little small minute that we were offered? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4106.921s">I'm</a>  sorry, I have a really hard time with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4110.891s">And</a>  the other thing that I was listening as we went along, do they deserve a raise? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4117.415s">Sure</a>  they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4118.556s">But</a>  when I read in Jenny Graham's email tonight, that a teacher's raise over the course of time is 256%, it took me 33 years to go from here to here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4127.982s">And,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4135.646s">I</a>  had to pay for those increments. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4138.549s">So</a>  when I went from a bachelor's to a bachelor's 15, I had to pay for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4144.033s">When</a>  I went from a master's to a master's 15 or 45, I had to pay for a school. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4150.699s">So</a>  I put out, I don't know, $20,000 to get what? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4157.285s">$1,000</a>  raise each time? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4159.106s">So</a>  when you sit there and say, they get all this money, <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4163.683s">We</a>  don't get all this money. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4165.244s">We</a>  have to pay to get this money. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4168.966s">And</a>  then when they turn to us and say, I'm sorry, we don't have the money to give you 3%. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4175.229s">You're</a>  not getting it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4176.49s">We'll</a>  give you, I think they started at zero. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4179.691s">Oh,</a>  1.5. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4180.652s">They</a>  did start at 1.5. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4182.352s">And</a>  then they were very upset that we came back and said, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4187.075s">We</a>  were off at pencils. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4189.076s">We</a>  thought that was pretty crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4191.792s">The</a>  things that they think I don't understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4195.133s">I</a>  do have a part-time job, along with, I'm gonna say 70% of the teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4201.314s">Do</a>  you think I make $30,000 in my part-time job? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4205.755s">No,</a>  of course I don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4207.255s">Why</a>  do I have a part-time job? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4208.636s">Because</a>  I'm a school teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4211.836s">And</a>  I have two children in college. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4213.697s">And</a>  I own a home here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4215.737s">So</a>  yes, people, my husband and I don't make a lot of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4221.434s">So</a>  I fight for what we're going to get. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4223.214s">And</a>  I haven't seen anyone on that school committee fighting for their race like we had to fight for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4230.456s">I'm</a>  sorry I get emotional because this is my home. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4235.816s">This</a>  is where I work, where I live, everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4238.597s">And</a>  I just see it and it's driving me crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4242.558s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4245.178s">I'm</a>  going to go to Zoom next.</p>

    <p>[Clements]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4276.566s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4277.127s">My</a>  name is Tracy Clements. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4278.828s">I</a>  live at 28 Alfred Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4281.421s">And</a>  I don't attend a lot of these meetings, but I've been paying a lot more attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4286.443s">And</a>  I, like everyone else, I believe people do deserve a raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4290.825s">But</a>  when you read Jenny Graham's email, and she states that you're at risk of losing 30 staff when you already don't have enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4298.087s">You've</a>  got buildings in disrepair. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4299.868s">People</a>  are waiting down halls in the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4301.669s">There's</a>  multi classrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4303.71s">The</a>  school my child goes to is severely understaffed with custodians, with aides, with teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4310.914s">And</a>  I just feel like you need to think about what you're doing before and understand and look at this budget before you start voting on raising your rate for a job that you wanted to run for, you got elected for, I understand you want to make money. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4330.638s">But</a>  reading Jenny Graham's email was really disheartening to see some of that stuff and to stand up there and say, you're going to make <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4338.968s">What</a>  just and I don't I don't remember what the pay increases for years three and four, but if it's It sounds like it's going to be an enormous jump and if you already don't have the money now And there's really no plan in place to get any more money from the city because you're not doing props You're not putting anything in place on on the ballots to get more money. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4358.614s">So</a>  I guess it's just really disheartening as a parent to see how hard these teachers work day in and day out <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4366.892s">And</a>  then to see like the previous speaker just said not one school committee person like fighting for this They're just assuming they're going to get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4374.419s">So</a>  it's just And maybe some of them don't even want it so I can't even speak for all of them It's just really disheartening as just a citizen of medford to see how bad the schools are but yet, you know reaping the benefits of Money, that's not even there</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4394.158s">Thank</a>  you, Tracy. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4395.178s">I'm</a>  going to go back to the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4397.459s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Anthony Geehan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4399.96s">My</a>  name is Anthony Guillen. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4402.121s">I</a>  live at 45 Elm Hill Avenue in Leamington, Massachusetts, and I am the president of the Med Fatiges Association. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4409.673s">like</a>  to start today, while it has been unpopular to just read out what other spoke of many snake in the surrounding towns, as was mentioned by Councilor Scott Peli Malden $12,000 a year, some level $15,000 a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4426.244s">Everett</a>  $12,500 a year, Belmont is unpaid, and Arlington is $3,500. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4432.049s">And</a>  I've heard arguments that a higher stipend or a higher yearly salary for a school committee member will attract lower income people. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4443.56s">And</a>  the hard truth of it is, the financial barrier is not once you get elected. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4449.693s">I've</a>  worked in local politics in many different levels, the financial barrier is running. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4454.177s">So</a>  there is a barrier already in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4456.159s">So</a>  we cannot pretend that an increase in the stipend is going to attract lower income candidates because they don't have the money to start with. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4465.367s">This</a>  is the matter of putting a down payment on a house argument. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4468.329s">If</a>  you don't have the money for the down payment, you can't afford the mortgage. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4471.913s">So</a>  I find it to be a disingenuous argument. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4477.298s">I'd</a>  also like to address again, as we got the email from school Councilor Graham on this hypothetical teacher who jumped from $30,000 in FY 2000 to $106,000 in FY 24. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4493.75s">I'd</a>  like to point out that to jump from a bachelor's to a master's is $7,500 per semester. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4500.155s">If</a>  you go to a program like I did at UMass Boston, which is one of the cheaper programs you can get your teaching certificate at, <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4507.253s">So</a>  you're looking at an average of four semesters, five semesters, depending on what you can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4512.741s">The</a>  plus 45 attached to that master's comes with programs you have to pay for out of pocket. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4520.753s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4522.093s">you're</a>  already spending money to get these changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4525.855s">And</a>  again, this comparison is not culpable. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4529.537s">As</a>  an order to gain this increase, the teacher has to work the job for 24 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4532.799s">This</a>  doesn't attach the money to the position, it attaches it to the teacher and it's there to keep them there, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4539.483s">So</a>  we cannot compare a teacher who has worked for 24 years to a position that may rotate in and out because the next teacher who takes over for that teacher isn't getting that pay, that pay goes down. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4552.918s">I</a>  also wanna address that when we were here last time speaking on this budget, many paraprofessionals came to speak, and after the meeting, they were pulled in for disciplinary hearings on what they said at this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4571.124s">Members</a>  of the school committee felt it was their duty to tell an educational professional to take their beating in silence, and I would like to say this, <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4582.191s">as</a>  the president of the union, as a teacher, and as a parent of a child who is in a special education program, that anyone who asks for silence from the workers who help our students is not abdicating for the students, they're abdicating for the status quo. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4600.642s">Nothing</a>  else.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4602.203s">Point</a>  of information, point of information, Councilor Villescaz. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4606.185s">I</a>  hate to interrupt, <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4608.433s">If</a>  this is true, have anybody filed? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4610.674s">Because</a>  this is serious.</p>

    <p>[Anthony Geehan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4612.235s">This</a>  is a paraprofessional. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4613.416s">I</a>  am not privy to who has filed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4615.777s">That</a>  is a different union.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4617.418s">I</a>  was spoken to by the head of the paraprofessionals union. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4621.021s">Again,</a>  this is one of the issues that I heard myself, so thank you.</p>

    <p>[Anthony Geehan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4623.742s">Good.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4623.922s">I'd</a>  like to end speaking tonight reiterating what I stated in September. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4627.885s">Our</a>  football coaches make $3,000 to $6,000 less a year than our neighboring school districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4635.049s">Our</a>  basketball and hockey coaches $2,000 to $3,000 less <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4638.806s">Our</a>  senior class advisors are given $1,000 annually to plan the prom, to plan graduation, to plan the gifts. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4647.754s">They</a>  start at a freshman level at $600 to plan the events. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4652.118s">We</a>  have several people who put on dances and put on events for the school that are paid almost nothing or nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4660.425s">And</a>  the money that's being talked about today can make a difference there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4664.83s">I'm</a>  not going to overstate how much money it is, but it can make a difference to the stipends. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4669.932s">And</a>  to be honest, the people who have been running our sports programs have been waiting for a raise just as long as school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4675.814s">There</a>  has not been movement on that for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4678.755s">And</a>  I will acknowledge we are in negotiations currently on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4681.977s">But</a>  again, that has to move at our pace, whereas this seems to be moving much faster. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4685.958s">So</a>  I thank you for your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4688.179s">I</a>  thank you for the opportunity to speak.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4732.022s">Under</a>  the proposals that have been proposed going to an effect? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4734.964s">Yes,</a>  July 1 2024. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4737.766s">I</a>  mean, it's it's money that is appropriated by the city budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4740.748s">So</a>  it could go to any rated amount.</p>

    <p>[Patricia Chery]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4744.311s">It</a>  could Okay, because I just thought last time we were talking about it, that it was being said that could only be used for raises for the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4753.237s">She's</a>  talking about raises.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4754.198s">Yeah,</a>  I mean, again, Patricia, just I have a point of clarification that we do not negotiate contracts. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4761.083s">We</a>  don't set the appropriation of any item school budget as a city council, except for this one item. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4766.648s">This</a>  is the only item that is set by the city council.</p>

    <p>[Patricia Chery]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4768.73s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4770.091s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4770.991s">And</a>  so for me, I mean, I do think the school committee needs a raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4776.075s">I</a>  do think that they're underpaid. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4779.618s">The</a>  amount that you guys are talking about is a stretch. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4783.847s">Um,</a>  I also think this comes at a really bad time. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4787.83s">Like</a>  we're just starting off the year and you guys are like paying for a job that we haven't even seen anybody do yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4794.934s">So</a>  it just, it's kind of disheartening in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4797.956s">But</a>  again, with that being said, I do think the school committee does need a raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4801.878s">I</a>  just think that the amount that you're looking at is just right now, not something that we can afford. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4807.242s">Um,</a>  to the schools are underfunded, understaffed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4812.225s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4813.638s">it</a>  could be used in better ways, I think anyways. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4817.902s">But</a>  I did want to touch on one other thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4819.763s">I</a>  think it was the gentleman who just stood up and it was said earlier about some comments that were made at the last meeting by paraprofessionals that were standing up and talking about how difficult their jobs are. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4833.214s">And</a>  we all do know they are difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4836.278s">But</a>  what I thought was a little bit much is the way that they were coming up and speaking of the children that they take care of. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4844.583s">It</a>  was <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4845.495s">kind</a>  of degrading as a mother of a child with special needs, it made it seem like all kids, because they kept saying high needs, high needs, high need classrooms, high need classrooms, that's all they were talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4855.983s">Well,</a>  these kids were fighting and spitting and kicking it made it seem like every single kid in the classroom was doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4862.047s">So</a>  when I walked away from that, yeah, I was upset. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4864.068s">And</a>  I was one who complained, because you know what, you already put it and my kids already stigmatized as it is, you just put some more on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4871.01s">So</a>  I wanna make that point to the guy who just stood up too, that that wasn't fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4877.294s">Again,</a>  our kids are already fighting to stay afloat, getting up there and making it seem like they're the only ones that are giving teachers and paraprofessionals a problem was a joke. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4886.759s">Because</a>  I can tell you, they're not the ones out there stabbing kids in bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4890.621s">They're</a>  not the ones out there punching each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4892.882s">They're</a>  not the ones out there having fights. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4894.763s">So</a>  next time you should just do it as an overall and say, <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4897.925s">All</a>  kids are an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4899.527s">We</a>  have a high job because all kids can be disciplined problems, not just high needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4905.512s">That's</a>  just a little food for thought for next time. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4908.075s">But</a>  yeah, so that's all I really have to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4910.977s">Thank</a>  you guys for the work you do.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4913.86s">Thank</a>  you, Patricia. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4916.69s">I'm</a>  seeing no more hands raised on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4919.052s">I</a>  will go to the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4921.053s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Buckley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4923.235s">Walter</a>  Buckley, president of Local 1032 Method Firefighters 340 Salmon Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4929.039s">I</a>  spoke in December at the meeting when it was first raised. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4932.381s">I</a>  just want to reiterate that the teachers and the fire department and the DPW and some of those small unions in this city have just negotiated their contracts. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4942.729s">The</a>  police are currently out of a contract for over a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4946.59s">For</a>  around 3%, say. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4949.573s">So</a>  this raise right here would take us 49 years to get to 148%. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4954.378s">49</a>  years. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4958.542s">And</a>  you guys are talking again about equality. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4960.484s">Well,</a>  Boston Fire makes $150,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4964.946s">We</a>  don't make close of that and we get laughed out of the city hall for trying to negotiate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4971.308s">So</a>  just a point of information there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4975.069s">It's</a>  sad that it's come to this and I don't know what kind of rules, are there rules to this meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4981.492s">Are</a>  you guys following the Robert rules or anything like that? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4984.213s">Or</a>  is it just a meeting?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4985.782s">been</a>  following the rules, are there rules?</p>

    <p>[Buckley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4987.264s">Well,</a>  I'm confused because Councilor Collins made a four-year motion that Councilor Zhang seconded, and then Councilor Zhang made a motion for two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=4998.855s">Would</a>  that not be an amendment to the motion, or is it just taking a bunch of motions?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5002.799s">They</a>  filed as separate motions. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5003.96s">We'll</a>  take them in order, and we'll read the full language. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5006.963s">We</a>  haven't taken votes on the motions. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5009.005s">I</a>  made my choices chair that I wanted to hear from the public before we.</p>

    <p>[Buckley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5012.506s">I'm</a>  just trying to for clarification.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5014.146s">Yeah,</a>  no, they're separate motions. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5017.547s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5017.847s">There</a>  may be further amendments to the motions, but we'll take them in the order that.</p>

    <p>[Buckley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5020.807s">Again,</a>  I just want to reiterate, we settled for a little around 3% and that would take 49 years to get that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5027.228s">So</a>  that's a little food for thought.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5029.569s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5030.249s">We</a>  do now have some hands on zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5032.289s">I'm</a>  going to go to Paul Garrity on zoom and then I'll come back to the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5039.056s">Paul,</a>  name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5041.778s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5042.399s">My</a>  name is Paul Geraghty, 40 Cedar Road in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5046.822s">During</a>  tonight's conversation, I heard a number of items mentioned relative to the amendments. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5053.947s">One</a>  was a regular evaluation. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5056.429s">Another</a>  one was passing this before the city charter for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5062.614s">My</a>  question is if it's in this the charter committee with <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5069.628s">some</a>  sort of evaluation process put in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5074.233s">Will</a>  there be any wording to the effect about metrics for performance? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5077.977s">I'm</a>  hearing evaluations and the job we're going to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5082.001s">But</a>  I'd like to see somewhere along the line some standards that the committees have to be held. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5086.726s">Some</a>  major project has to be completed, some proposal that's being funded for the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5091.631s">But</a>  somewhere along the line, <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5093.633s">If</a>  the members of the council and the school committee are looking for pay and pay for performance, I would like to have some wording in the final writing of the bill, if it goes forward, in terms of specific metrics for performance. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5111.936s">And</a>  if they're reached, fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5113.416s">If</a>  they're not reached, then there needs to be some kind of consequences or other alternatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5118.757s">I</a>  just don't want to catch a cold. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5121.698s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5124.278s">Thank</a>  you, Paul. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5124.959s">I</a>  do not know that we have the authority to implement that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5129.904s">Certainly</a>  under this process, I don't know if the charter process would be different. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5137.031s">Go</a>  to the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5137.672s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[nSaVwvkinrs_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5139.173s">Hi</a>  there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5139.454s">My</a>  name is Maureen Lavin. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5140.475s">I'm</a>  a teacher in the metropolitan public school system at the Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5144.102s">Um,</a>  again, I had no intention of speaking tonight, but I guess I can't help myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5148.543s">Um,</a>  a couple of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5151.504s">Um,</a>  it seems like everybody's all over the place. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5155.345s">So</a>  to put a vote forward would seem crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5158.865s">I</a>  think that, like, getting numbers and whatnot in order seems like that's what you folks are going to do, which is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5165.847s">because</a>  it's confusing sitting here listening to all kinds of numbers flying around. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5170.71s">Now,</a>  I don't think anybody is opposed to anybody getting a pay increase, but correct me if I'm wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5178.835s">These</a>  are stipend positions, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5181.517s">Are</a>  these stipends? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5183.518s">I'm</a>  asking.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5184.959s">In</a>  what sense? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5186.439s">I</a>  receive a weekly paycheck.</p>

    <p>[nSaVwvkinrs_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5188.201s">So</a>  it's a weekly paycheck, but is it considered a stipend?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5192.785s">The</a>  school committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5194.526s">We're</a>  W-2 employees at the city of the school districts.</p>

    <p>[nSaVwvkinrs_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5198.328s">Okay,</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5199.469s">So</a>  my concern is that the huge increase given the state of what's happening in our schools, which has been brought up by many people, but this is a part-time position, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5217.038s">And</a>  somebody spoke to making a living wage <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5223.131s">Well,</a>  this is not a living wage position. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5226.494s">If</a>  you want a living wage, go get a full time job. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5231.358s">I</a>  mean, I'm a teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5233.74s">And</a>  I've always had two jobs while teaching. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5236.763s">The</a>  only time I haven't had two jobs is when I was paying for my own advanced education. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5244.95s">And</a>  that's how we get like a <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5247.58s">a</a>  better pay increase, which has been brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5250.662s">Because</a>  otherwise, as teachers, the more we work, the less we make, because don't forget, many other unions here, they get overtime, we do not. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5263.348s">And</a>  the paraprofessionals that spoke last week, <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5269.179s">I</a>  don't think anybody meant to offend anybody, but those paraprofessionals tend to be the ones that are in those high needs classrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5279.389s">And</a>  I don't think that the general public understands what that is on a day-to-day basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5285.175s">I</a>  don't think anybody was trying to offend anybody, but I really, <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5292.327s">would</a>  like to see folks visit our schools and see what the day-to-day is for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5300.408s">We</a>  have trouble getting substitutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5303.029s">School</a>  committee, come on down, spend a day once a week and sub at a different school in a different subject. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5308.31s">As</a>  a paraprofessional, see what our day-to-day is. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5311.65s">It's</a>  important that we see the whole picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5315.191s">And</a>  there was many conversations that took place that, oh, I didn't realize that's what was happening in the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5322.062s">Well,</a>  how can you speak to that if you don't know what's happening in the schools? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5327.684s">So</a>  I really, as city councilors, I really hope that you dig in a little bit deeper into what's actually happening in the school systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5337.884s">We've</a>  had rain, a lot of rain, and the schools were affected by that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5343.806s">This</a>  is not something new. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5345.146s">It</a>  just was over the top with the amount of rain that took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5349.347s">But</a>  every day, the buildings leak. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5352.448s">This</a>  is not anything new. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5354.468s">We</a>  have problems with our facilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5357.769s">But</a>  I'm gonna just back up one step. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5360.15s">Our</a>  coaches, <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5362.23s">and</a>  our paraprofessionals need to get a better salary. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5369.056s">than</a>  what's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5370.658s">It</a>  would make no sense at all to put a huge increase into the school committee before our full-time paraprofessionals. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5382.068s">And</a>  our coaches, like Anthony said, haven't had an increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5387.152s">It's</a>  probably the lowest paying salary or the stipends, because they get stipends, one of the lowest paid stipends in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5395.72s">So</a>  I do appreciate the data. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5400.184s">We</a>  all like data. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5402.505s">What</a>  do the school committees make in other districts that are similar to ours? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5408.13s">Nobody's</a>  making 20 plus thousand dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5411.052s">Nobody</a>  is. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5412.894s">Somerville</a>  is 15. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5413.994s">I</a>  looked that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5414.795s">Melrose,</a>  guess what they make? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5416.296s">Nothing.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5417.557s">They</a>  don't make anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5419.138s">It's</a>  a volunteer position. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5420.319s">We</a>  appreciate that you're here doing a service for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5426.064s">But</a>  you can't expect a fair wage. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5431.365s">It's</a>  not a full-time job. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5433.026s">Go</a>  get a job and then do this part-time. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5435.647s">I</a>  have a full-time job and I have a part-time job because I'm a teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5440.328s">And</a>  that's what we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5441.408s">We</a>  have two jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5442.729s">And</a>  now I have to come here tonight when I'm exhausted from working two jobs because I'm trying to fight for the rest of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5451.511s">So</a>  please consider that I don't know, I you know, I hope that there's more that goes on than one against everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5459.863s">I</a>  hope that you guys can collaborate. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5462.326s">Because</a>  that's how things get done. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5464.429s">When</a>  you work together, see each other's point of view. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5467.473s">And</a>  don't <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5468.635s">Don't</a>  just focus. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5469.875s">We're</a>  programmed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5471.576s">You</a>  say yes, and everybody follows in line and says yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5474.576s">And</a>  then that one person says no. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5476.157s">Let's</a>  work together here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5477.577s">That's</a>  for the greater good of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5480.077s">And</a>  we need that from you people. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5482.318s">And</a>  we need that from our school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5484.398s">And</a>  I'm gonna leave, end with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5487.099s">When</a>  I want a pay increase, I show up and ask for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5492.62s">I</a>  don't see anybody here asking for a pay increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5497.714s">When</a>  we want to pay increase, we ask for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5501.518s">How</a>  many of the school committee members have asked for a raise? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5504.781s">Because</a>  maybe they should be here and say, yes, I'd like a raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5508.164s">No,</a>  I do not. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5509.405s">Like,</a>  let's get a poll on who wants it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5511.587s">Because</a>  are we just going to give out a raise to a group of people that one person wants to raise? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5518.293s">Or</a>  does the whole body want the raise? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5520.751s">We</a>  need to work smarter here, and we need to take care of the people on the front line who deal with the children. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5527.733s">Our</a>  kids are the most important thing, your kids are the most important thing, and we need to serve them fully. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5534.174s">That's</a>  all I have, thank you.</p>

<a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5590.272s">Absolutely</a>  not. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5591.713s">And</a>  another thing that was written to me in an email is that paraprofessionals go up to school committees and say about disabilities so that we can get more money. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5602.142s">Hell</a>  no. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5604.984s">Our</a>  kindergarten teachers are making $17,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5607.146s">They're</a>  using Google Translate all day long on their own phones, not reimbursed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5614.042s">just</a>  to make sure, because I've always said to them, make sure that the child can say, I need to go to the bathroom, I need a drink of water. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5622.388s">And</a>  they said to me, Don't worry about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5625.25s">We</a>  have a Google Translate. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5626.931s">Oh,</a>  citizens pay for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5629.033s">They</a>  don't care. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5629.693s">They</a>  just care about races. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5631.114s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5632.035s">So</a>  let's start with some sort of, you know, mechanism for useful tools, maybe a walkie <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5639.5s">hockey,</a>  maybe some kids get into the building, maybe a computer, maybe a translator, maybe paying for people that are changing diapers, for people that are cranking. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5651.008s">So</a>  you don't know what we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5653.97s">And</a>  I apologize if it looks like <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5657.773s">Is</a>  it the student's fault? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5658.955s">Absolutely</a>  not. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5660.917s">Students</a>  have nothing to do with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5663.481s">They</a>  are every day fighting just to be the best person that they can be because we love kids with disabilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5673.014s">We</a>  love any kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5674.896s">And</a>  I can tell you that maybe if somebody said, okay, I got hurt in the eye, but that had nothing to do with the child, they're saying the job is a little volatile, not the child. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5690.649s">So</a>  I really, I just want to, I want to say how we appreciate any student, but we are also called off onto the table every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5703.132s">What</a>  did you say? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5703.713s">What</a>  did you do? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5704.394s">How</a>  did you handle it? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5705.395s">Where</a>  did you go? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5706.076s">Were</a>  you wearing perfume? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5706.977s">Were</a>  you wearing lipstick? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5708.198s">Did</a>  you eat tuna fish? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5709.52s">Did</a>  you have a cup of coffee? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5710.601s">Where's</a>  your phone? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5713.404s">Hey,</a>  enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5716.068s">Listen</a>  to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5717.069s">We're</a>  here to educate. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5718.931s">And</a>  we educate when we educate. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5722.02s">We</a>  belong, we educate the community, not just the child. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5726.784s">So</a>  I appreciate Ian, Councilor Ian, for even saying paraprofessionals, because nobody has ever said that word before in any chambers, including the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5738.554s">And</a>  George, you know, we love you down here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5741.176s">So</a>  I appreciate you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5743.378s">And</a>  other councillors, I trust in you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5747.722s">I</a>  know you'll do the right thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5749.915s">but</a>  17,000 translating people, changing practice, breaking people. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5755.658s">No,</a>  not good at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5758.539s">So</a>  let's show some spirit, some community spirit. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5762.421s">Let's</a>  have the school committee come to all members, teachers, and every public employee, and sit at the table just like we do, and negotiate with us this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5775.548s">We'll</a>  negotiate with you for a raise, just like we're told there's no money. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5780.885s">I</a>  thank you for your time, Councilor Bears and everybody else, and I appreciate all my co-workers that are up here speaking for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5787.992s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5788.593s">God</a>  bless.</p>

    <p>[Silberman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5799.144s">Hannah</a>  Silberman, 15 Maynard in Bedford. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5804.857s">I</a>  teach at Roberts Elementary School, and again, that's the second largest school in the district, second only to Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5811.967s">And</a>  again, if we're going to talk about equity, I think that we should start with our zoning and redistricting issues that lead to inequitable student numbers in our elementary schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5821.894s">And</a>  if you're wondering why our chamber is a bit empty this evening it's because teachers are really frustrated really disheartened by this whole resolution and feel that it's hopeless to be here that there was no point in us being here tonight, and that you've already made up your minds anyways, just like last time is what I heard today. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5840.182s">What</a>  I heard last time we were here was that a lot of the issues that we raised were news to you, that you were grateful to us for bringing these issues to your attention, and you asked us to please come to more city council meetings and make our voices heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5854.97s">And</a>  listen, we're tired. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5856.771s">It's</a>  already past my bedtime, and these kids don't teach themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5860.793s">This</a>  job gets harder every single year. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5863.334s">And</a>  it was my understanding that it's the job of the school committee to inform you of issues pertaining to the schools, not our job. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5870.82s">And</a>  if the school committee is not doing their job, then why are we giving them such a huge raise? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5876.644s">It</a>  seems like City Council would rather spend school funding repairing the relationship with school committee than repairing our flooding, molding buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5888.453s">City</a>  Council gets to vote on giving themselves and giving a school committee, giving school committee a raise whenever they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5894.898s">Teachers,</a>  however, do not get to give ourselves a raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5898.14s">We</a>  stand outside in the freezing cold with signs for a 3% raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5902.784s">We</a>  bust our tails continuing our education with the latest best practices. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5907.407s">We</a>  have to constantly fund our own education on our teacher salaries while working multiple jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5914.775s">With</a>  every tone-deaf resolution like this passed, Medford loses more and more credibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5920.079s">Who</a>  would want to work for a school district that puts more money and more funding into administration than school and student support? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5927.885s">This</a>  resolution is going to give the mayor an extra 30-ish thousand dollars a year from our school budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5935.35s">There's</a>  already a very limited pool of funding, and taking away from that is going to decrease the chances of student success. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5943.035s">You</a>  say that school committee should be representative of the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5947.698s">Yes,</a>  absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5949.56s">And</a>  so should our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5951.381s">You're</a>  saying that you need the salaries to be competitive. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5955.524s">Yes,</a>  absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5956.925s">And</a>  so do we. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5958.486s">We</a>  are trying to get the best applicants possible to work with our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5962.609s">And</a>  to do so, we have to attract those applicants. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5965.551s">There's</a>  a continued list every single week in the superintendent's email of positions we cannot fill. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5971.754s">And</a>  if we want to fill those positions, our salaries need to be competitive. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5975.836s">And</a>  they are not right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5980.178s">Which</a>  is why all of these positions have been open since the beginning of the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5985.06s">If</a>  you're using the school budget, then we should be talking about using this money on people that our students see every single day in front of them, that they can learn from, that they can connect with, not a politician who stops by the school once a year for a photo op. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=5999.888s">Giving</a>  the school committee members a raise is one thing, but giving them a raise of this size from our already underfunded school budget is fiscally irresponsible. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6008.513s">Please</a>  do the right thing and spend school funding on what's important, the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6013.136s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[O'Hare]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6202.543s">Doreen</a>  O'Hare, 325 Malden Street in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6209.19s">I</a>  am appalled that this snuck under the radar, the last meeting in December, when city councilors were leaving conveniently, new members join. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6224.683s">I</a>  think you need to take a look and educate everyone, because these motions flying around don't make any sense to anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6235.131s">on</a>  this side of the fence, OK? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6237.212s">And</a>  I'll tell you, to sit there and say you want to file a motion for every year incremental increases is absurd. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6246.778s">You</a>  don't know what the budget's going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6249.06s">So</a>  how can you just say, we're going to just automatically do this, blindfolded? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6255.074s">And</a>  the main thing that I heard tonight, and this is really what got me up here, is the fact that somebody reported that a paraprofessional that came to this meeting and brought facts to the table <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6272.523s">were</a>  tried to be silenced, are you kidding me? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6276.284s">Every</a>  single one of you on this panel needs to look in the mirror every day and realize we have some serious fiscal concerns in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6287.667s">We</a>  are severely underfunded across the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6291.868s">It's</a>  not like anybody's got huge amounts of money flying around. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6296.26s">You</a>  know, to Councilor Scarpelli's point, the ARPA money, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6301.424s">It's</a>  gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6302.344s">You</a>  know, we need to look at that and be fiscally responsible. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6309.301s">I</a>  have never been so passionate about this community as I am right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6318.868s">Because</a>  I'm talking to the people of the community of Medford right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6323.332s">Wake</a>  up, show up, and pay attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6328.055s">Because</a>  these people were voted in on a platform, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6335.481s">So</a>  you can sit there and vote on your platform, <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6339.036s">But</a>  the people here are the ones that are gonna vote you in next time. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6346.299s">So</a>  think of it and really please do right by our community because we need you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6353.242s">We</a>  need your vote on common sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6356.524s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6541.02s">I</a>  want to first acknowledge before I begin speaking that I'm not necessarily coming up here in support of one side or the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6547.184s">I</a>  just want to, you know, offer some thoughts about what I've been hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6551.506s">I</a>  appreciate the teachers showing up in full force. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6553.848s">I'm</a>  sorry I have my back to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6555.028s">It</a>  feels wrong, but I appreciate the discourse tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6557.67s">I</a>  appreciate the openness of the council to hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6560.211s">the</a>  public debate, but I do want to encourage all of you on both sides of this debate that there is a moral responsibility to have this argument with all of the facts and all of the understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6570.039s">From</a>  my understanding, this would not come at the direct cost of teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6577.005s">I</a>  don't believe that this council is sitting here and saying we either give money to these teachers now or give it to <a

jurisdiction over the contracts if they're not up for debate. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6592.196s">So</a>  let's also be mindful of that because people who are listening to this debate and may not be participating in the same capacity as we are, are gonna hear that and they're gonna walk away with an incorrect impression of how this issue plays out. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6603.704s">And</a>  that is not to disagree with the teachers because I come from a family of teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6609.408s">My</a>  mother is a teacher, my grandmother is a teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6612.959s">Um,</a>  I substitute teach in Lynn public schools, one, because my mother is an assistant principal there, but also because my free doesn't pay the subs enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6621.023s">And</a>  so I have to make that decision for my well being in my economic situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6626.386s">But</a>  there are also people who want to hold office and do hold office that are making those same calculations based on their economic decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6633.75s">And</a>  we should be able to have a conversation about pay increases without devaluing the work of teachers, but also not devaluing the work of elected officials. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6643.134s">It's</a>  hard to do both of those jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6645.335s">It's</a>  hard to do them in conditions where you feel like people don't understand what you go through on a day-to-day basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6650.618s">And</a>  so when you're having this debate, please be mindful of what you want to see reflected in your elected office holders. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6657.481s">You</a>  probably want teachers to run for office so you know that somebody's there <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6662.423s">that</a>  understands what the school looks like on a day to day basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6665.746s">But</a>  teachers aren't going to go run for office if the pay isn't there because they know what it's like to have to stretch to make ends meet. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6672.352s">And</a>  also, I understand that many of you have multiple sources of income and have multiple jobs, but we shouldn't accept that as like normal. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6680.8s">Nobody</a>  should have to work three jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6683.202s">Nobody</a>  should have to be a school teacher and pay your student loans and go to grad school, but also wait tables and also babysit and also do a million other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6692.429s">We</a>  shouldn't accept that from anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6694.831s">And</a>  we also have to be mindful of when we're having these conversations about resolutions and pay cuts, is that not everyone is an established individual that owns property that <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6707.1s">can</a>  afford to take a pay cut. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6709.401s">I</a>  lost my job earlier this year and it was a very difficult time for me and I'm still going through that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6714.783s">And</a>  people rent and that costs money and people lose their jobs all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6718.404s">So</a>  I just encourage everybody to be mindful about making false equivalencies, about devaluing any form of labor. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6725.126s">and</a>  continue to have this discussion in good faith, but recognize the work of both sides, of our teachers, of our elected officials, and what's setting a standard of decorum, a standard of work, a standard of living. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6738.554s">What</a>  are you going to establish when you pass this law, when you pass this ordinance? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6742.757s">What</a>  does that mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6744.018s">And</a>  I encourage you all to keep an open mind and understand that, you know, I <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6749.882s">voted</a>  for most of you up here and I would not have voted if I thought you were going to screw teachers and schools over. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6755.595s">And</a>  I don't think that's the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6757.436s">And</a>  they're not going to screw teachers and schools over because that's not what I voted you all in to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6762.638s">And</a>  so I trust that you will be mindful and the optics are bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6766.52s">And</a>  maybe if there's a way to have this vote later, have it later. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6769.941s">But</a>  I also encourage the schools, please do not devalue the elected officials that fight for you every day in their personal and their professional lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6777.285s">Because</a>  a different city council probably wouldn't <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6780.646s">support</a>  you in the way that you would want. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6782.348s">So</a>  I encourage you to think about that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6785.471s">And</a>  thank you for your time, everyone.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6788.875s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6848.435s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6851.117s">Anyone</a>  else like to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6854.379s">Anyone</a>  on public participation, anyone on Zoom? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6859.615s">that.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6860.276s">If</a>  I may, Councilor Tseng just before, and this will be pretty much all I have to say, and then I'll try to go through the motions, and I did also try to given the feedback of the audience tried to put these proposals into a graphical representation, which I'll show, which should make it easier for us to understand and compare them. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6880.114s">I</a>  appreciate everything that's been said. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6881.514s">I</a>  mean, we're going through the deliberative process. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6883.855s">Something</a>  that I said in December was that it was an initial proposal that would be considered and further vetted by the council, which we're doing this evening and may continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6893.538s">We'll</a>  see what happens with the motions that pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6896.319s">I</a>  just wanna say very simply that I do not think that any union or bargaining unit in the city would go for 23 years without a compensation increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6909.485s">I</a>  don't think anyone would accept that, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6912.227s">Is</a>  there anyone who would say that's, you know, we'll go for 23 years and then after 23 years we'll come back and we'll ask for 2%. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6918.511s">So,</a>  excuse me? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6930.834s">All</a>  right, thank you, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6932.155s">I'm</a>  gonna continue now. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6933.876s">So</a>  as I was saying, I don't think there's, Mr. McGilvery, if you could just let me speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6939.541s">I</a>  don't think there's anyone in this community who would accept that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6943.825s">Any</a>  union leader, any union member who would say, oh, after 23 years, we'll start at two, we'll start 2% for the next four years. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6950.53s">So</a>  it's a false equivalence to compare, oh, let's address 23 years of no adjustment to compensation <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6957.717s">and</a>  say, oh, we're starting down to 23 years, we'll let that go. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6960.638s">Zeroes</a>  for 23 years, we'll start 2% now. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6963.899s">No</a>  one would accept that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6964.92s">So</a>  it's a false equivalence to say that we would. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6966.7s">And</a>  that's the only thing I'm gonna say to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6968.981s">There's</a>  something that has happened for 25 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6971.482s">For</a>  whatever reason, the council here for 23 years, sorry, never chose to take action on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6978.104s">If</a>  a mayor held out on a union for 23 years or a school committee held out on a contract for 23 years, I mean, we all know that would never happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6985.45s">right,</a>  the union would take action to stop that from happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6989.612s">So</a>  I just want to put that out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6991.493s">It's</a>  just a false equivalency. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=6992.694s">And</a>  that's the one piece of the discussion tonight that that stuck with me and kind of I didn't feel was a fair representation of the facts. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7000.799s">But</a>  beyond that, I appreciate the discussion from everyone tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7004.461s">I</a>  appreciate the further proposals, I think, as the motions have been made to look at longer times of phase in and lesser amounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7013.226s">And</a>  we'll see <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7014.036s">those</a>  motions are considered going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7016.257s">And</a>  I will go now to the podium, Mr. Mayor.</p>

    <p>[McGilvey]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7017.578s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7018.018s">Harry</a>  McGilvey for Piedmont Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7020.48s">You're</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7020.88s">Nobody</a>  would accept 23 years without a pay raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7023.362s">You're</a>  100% right. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7024.542s">And</a>  I said, there's not a union member probably here that would be against someone getting a pay raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7029.845s">But</a>  a false equivalency is what you just said. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7032.947s">We</a>  work under three-year bargaining, bargain contracts. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7037.03s">The</a>  school committee and the city council are not bargaining units. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7041.112s">They</a>  don't work under contracts. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7042.773s">There's</a>  no collective bargaining here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7044.954s">You</a>  folks run for office at a salary that has been established. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7051.316s">Everybody</a>  who puts their hat in the ring, and I give you credit for putting your hat in the ring and seeking public office, I do. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7059.339s">But</a>  you know what you're getting into. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7061.38s">And</a>  then to get elected after the election is over and the dust settles, it's a bad look. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7068.163s">to</a>  then go to the taxpayers and say, we're going to give ourselves a pay raise.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7071.726s">Well,</a>  we're not going to give ourselves a pay raise.</p>

    <p>[McGilvey]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7073.407s">I</a>  understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7074.568s">Let's</a>  not get. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7076.209s">What</a>  I'm trying to say, what we what I think what's trying to what we're trying to say here tonight is. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7082.434s">We're</a>  not treated. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7085.956s">We're</a>  not treated fairly most of the time during contract negotiations, and it's frustrating to see something like this happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7094.608s">You</a>  saw the teachers and the firefighters outside this building all last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7102.152s">You</a>  saw them at different events throughout the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7104.533s">We</a>  should not have to get to that to get a 2% pay raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7113.591s">And</a>  everybody works. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7115.753s">It's</a>  a fact of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7116.734s">Everybody</a>  works one, two jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7118.375s">It</a>  depends on where you wanna be. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7120.737s">That's</a>  gonna gauge how hard you work, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7124.46s">So</a>  I appreciate what you were saying, but to say 23 years, we wouldn't stand for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7133.488s">We're</a>  under collective bargaining agreements that by law go every three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7138.746s">Chapter</a>  150E is a very strong union chapter in mass general law for bargaining units, and we appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7151.74s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7152.801s">I</a>  appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7153.321s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. McGilvery. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7155.223s">I</a>  certainly would not negotiate the way that previous contract negotiations were negotiated.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7164.451s">I</a>  believe Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7165.952s">Councilor</a>  Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7166.833s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears, and thank you for all the feedback, for the public participation, even if we don't see eye to eye with the proposals I put forward on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7180.211s">I</a>  do think it's really important to clarify some things for the audience watching, and the audience online as well, which I should note, which is just to clarify the proposal, at least that I put forward on the floor, and to really get a better grasp of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7200.78s">So</a>  the first thing is, <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7203.081s">My</a>  proposal follows the rates of the increases over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7207.245s">It</a>  doesn't follow the amount increase over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7210.829s">And</a>  because the school committee pay starts at a lower amount, this is actually a smaller total amount than what we would see for the average teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7220.279s">But</a>  this is the same percentage rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7222.861s">And</a>  I keep hearing <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7227.517s">I</a>  mean, maybe it's not about this proposal, but the percentage change figures of things in the hundreds, which is not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7237.1s">This</a>  proposal that I put forward is a 2.48% annual increase, or a percentage annual increase, which I've heard 3% be standard for some unions. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7250.044s">I've</a>  heard other percentages. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7251.785s">This</a>  is the MTA, what's standard for the MTA over that period of time, which tracks very, <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7256.606s">closely</a>  to inflation. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7258.987s">I</a>  also took a second to calculate the actual dollar impact of this proposal as well by fiscal 2026. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7271.574s">And</a>  so in fiscal 26, the proposal I've laid on the floor will cost taxpayers $35,472.40, which is not that much. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7278.18s">And</a>  to be completely clear, we can't fill empty positions at that rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7280.221s">I</a>  think we should be careful of false equivalencies we're taking. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7299.516s">from</a>  some people and giving to others because that's number one, not how the budget works. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7304.699s">And</a>  number two, we're talking about $35,472.40. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7308.1s">And</a>  I think the conversations that we're having tonight that we've had over the last month really underscores a bigger question of underfunding in the terms of millions. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7325.45s">not</a>  thousands of dollars or thousand dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7328.717s">We</a>  need to have a conversation about business districts and about <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7334.312s">ballot</a>  measures and about zoning, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7337.033s">We</a>  need to have a conversation about those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7339.915s">For</a>  example, the council recently passed, or the last council passed at the end of the year, a Medford Square ordinance change that would redevelop Medford Square and bring business and investment money in, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7352.881s">That's</a>  stuff over the longer term that we can use for our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7358.684s">I</a>  think it's also really important to note that we also can't legally break a contract to give a raise as much as I personally would want to. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7367.289s">And</a>  sadly, $35,000 probably doesn't split great over the amount of staff that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7375.714s">I</a>  think, you know, to the point that about the living wage. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7380.486s">I</a>  am sympathetic to the point from the fellow Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7385.931s">I</a>  think the living wage is an ideal, and I want to be very clear that neither the proposal I've laid out on the floor or the proposal that Councilor Collins has on the floor would make this job necessarily a living wage. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7399.703s">It</a>  would just make it more justifiable to take. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7404.699s">So</a>  I think it's important to clarify all those points as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7411.112s">There's</a>  one more point that I wanted to bring up, and it's one point that I'm <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7415.771s">particularly</a>  sympathetic towards, that of the paraprofessionals. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7420.056s">And</a>  the way that we have it phased in would almost definitely ensure in either proposal, given contract negotiations, that school committee members do not make more than the lowest paid paraprofessionals. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7434.671s">I</a>  have the paraprofessional salary chart <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7438.815s">in</a>  front of me. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7440.356s">And</a>  if the lowest paid pair of professionals being paid $17,000, then we should definitely have a connect them with human resources, because that is not what the contract says. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7452.001s">And</a>  they're being mispaid. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7453.482s">And</a>  so we should work on that if that's if that's the case, because the lowest figure I have is $20,500. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7462.04s">um,</a>  for for kindergarten needs, which is again definitely way too low. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7467.362s">It's</a>  unjustifiable. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7468.943s">But</a>  in my opinion, voting for an increase, um, a reasonable increase, a compromise proposal, um, would basically allow us to lift all boats and to give us a reason to lift all boats as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7485.21s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7485.49s">I</a>  think that's they're saying Councilor living.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7490.545s">Just</a>  first off, I would like to thank MTA President Gehan for bringing up the issue about the paraprofessional receiving disciplinary action. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7500.014s">I</a>  know that Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7501.355s">Cherry</a>  also commented on it, but any information that you're free to email about that to me, I would very much appreciate just to <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7508.542s">learn</a>  more about that particular situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7510.863s">This</a>  is just a broader point that echoes a lot of what's been said. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7519.546s">For</a>  a long time Medford's been penny smart and dollar stupid. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7527.489s">So</a>  we're talking about <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7534.008s">the,</a>  when we're talking about the total operating budget of Medford, it's just above about $200 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7540.21s">Somerville's</a>  is between seven and 800 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7542.931s">Cambridge's</a>  is about a billion. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7545.092s">If</a>  you're considering the sort of per capita operating budget, so the amount of money spent per person in a municipality, Medford's is one of the lowest for a substantially sized city in the state of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7561.157s">Basically,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7563.618s">We</a>  have been trying to cut costs here and there for a very long period of time, and that's the reason that right now we can't pay teachers what they deserve to be paid when we're talking about when we're talking about exchanging. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7578.895s">in</a>  the grand scheme of things, relatively small amounts of money here and there when we're talking about cutting staff costs, that can save money in a given fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7591.021s">It</a>  does not save money in the long term. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7593.082s">We</a>  need to start thinking about fiscal responsibility in terms of investing in ourselves in the long term, not saving money in the very short term. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7603.287s">I</a>  would, but yes, I, <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7606.184s">Once</a>  again, I very much sympathize with the teacher's views on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7611.388s">The</a>  optics are terrible, and I appreciate your presence here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7616.952s">Thank</a>  you very much for your time.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7622.676s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Lemme. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7628.08s">There</a>  is one more hand on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7630.722s">I</a>  just saw a raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7631.543s">I</a>  will go to Brianna Martinetti on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7639.742s">You</a>  should be unmuted. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7640.563s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7641.904s">And</a>  if not, I'll press the button again. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7645.368s">It's</a>  going to give you a pop-up. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7650.012s">We</a>  still can't hear you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7653.996s">Let</a>  me try that again. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7654.657s">I'm</a>  going to press a button, and it should pop up and ask you to unmute. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7666.789s">I</a>  can't actually make it unmute you, and I apologize for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7670.051s">And</a>  maybe it's on the phone. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7684.898s">It</a>  should be kind of a dialog box with a blue button in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7690.181s">I</a>  see you looking for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7691.121s">I'm</a>  really sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7691.962s">If</a>  I could just unmute you, I would, but it doesn't let me.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7701.55s">Council</a>  President Washington is searching, can I just make a comment?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7704.429s">Uh,</a>  sure.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7706.37s">There</a>  was something that was passed by. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7707.992s">And</a>  I think that as a, as a former coach of 32 years, I didn't realize that coaches haven't been paid, haven't got an increase in 20 years as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7716.878s">So</a>  that might be something that, um, we should remember just for the budget process, because I think all of us realize the importance that they, they play in our lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7726.725s">So</a>  I know it's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7728.186s">A</a>  lot of those coaches have been there for 20 years, you know, a coach like Louis Jerry.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7733.544s">But</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7735.024s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Skowale. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7735.764s">Do</a>  you wanna do that in the form of a motion or? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7737.525s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7739.205s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7743.326s">Here,</a>  let's try this one. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7744.346s">I'm</a>  gonna ask you to unmute again. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7746.866s">There</a>  we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7748.607s">Is</a>  it working now? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7749.267s">Can</a>  you address for the record, please?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_26]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7751.287s">Hey,</a>  yeah, this is Grant Marnetti, 188 Washington Street in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7756.628s">I</a>  heard, Justin, you had just mentioned that 35,000 <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7761.889s">was</a>  not much for taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7764.651s">As</a>  a taxpayer, that's really insulting to hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7767.992s">I'm</a>  going to be honest, like, I don't hold it against renters being here, but to spend someone else's money and just say it so blatant is insulting. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7779.499s">You</a>  know, I heard Councilor Scarpelli mention that he was willing to give up some of his pay for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7786.502s">I</a>  think to put this on a level playing field, <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7789.784s">For</a>  you to say that, I think you should be willing to pay the average tax and the average rate that Medford citizens pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7798.39s">And</a>  if you do that, I think it would be a lot easier to sit there and spend my money. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7803.773s">That's</a>  all I have to say.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7808.777s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7810.958s">Any</a>  other comments from members of the public? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7815.361s">Seeing</a>  none, I'm going to review the motions as I have them. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7817.923s">I</a>  did try to do some of the math here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7820.711s">Um</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7822.807s">There's</a>  a motion from Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Tseng to report the following out of committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7827.829s">Be</a>  it resolved that the City Council, pursuant to Chapter 7152, set the following rates of compensation effective July 1, 2024. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7835.933s">School</a>  committee member $17,052.80, school committee vice chair $17,900, school committee secretary $19,075, school committee chair $18,750. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7851.035s">be</a>  it resolved that the Council, pursuant to General Laws, Chapter 71, Section 52, set the following rates for July 1, 2025. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7858.441s">School</a>  committee member, 22,105.60. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7859.281s">I</a>  will show a chart in a minute, by the way, I know this is a lot of numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7863.004s">School</a>  committee vice chair, 23,200. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7863.925s">School</a>  committee secretary, 23,750. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7865.566s">School</a>  committee chair, 24,300. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7875.046s">be</a>  resolved by the City Council that effective July 1 26 school committee members salary 25,732 70 26,920 for the vice chair, 27,775 for the secretary, 28 4 25 for the chair and then July 1 2027 effective 29 3 59 84 school committee member. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7899.723s">30,640</a>  for the Vice Chair, 31,760 for the Secretary, and 32,550 for the Chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7907.605s">There</a>  was a second motion by Councilor Tseng, seconded by Councilor Leming, that would just have incorporated the first two of those, the raises for effective July 1, 2024 and July 1, 2025. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7919.71s">there</a>  was a motion to refer the following to the Governance Committee, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that the Governance Committee consider during charter review the inclusion of a mechanism within the updated city charter to trigger automatic COLA increases and or compensation review for all elected positions at regular intervals. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7936.458s">And</a>  then there was a motion by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro to report out of committee the following resolution, be it resolved that the Council lower its own rate of pay to the equivalent amount to <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=7949.81s">to</a>  the amount, how do we phrase this, George?

<a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8003.624s">So</a>  the current rates effective, it's currently effective 12,000, 13,200, 14,400, 12,600. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8007.587s">The</a>  initial proposal that was proposed on December 12th would have, on January 1, 2024, increased the rates to 29,359.80, 3,000 would increase to these numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8013.791s">The</a>  proposal by Councilor Tseng would, on July 1, 2024, <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8033.686s">increase</a>  the amounts to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8036.788s">On</a>  July 1, 2025, increase the amounts to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8040.089s">And</a>  then the proposal by Councilor Collins has the same for the first two years with a further increase July 1, 2026 and July 1, 2027. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8049.293s">So</a>  that's the difference between the current amount, the initial proposal and the two proposals on the floor from Councilor Tseng and Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8061.539s">And</a>  if I did the math wrong, please <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8064.448s">Let</a>  me know. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8103.387s">All</a>  right, is there any discussion on the motions?

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8109.933s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8110.833s">I</a>  appreciate you putting this into a visual format on the fly. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8114.617s">I</a>  think at this point in the discussion, we've all spoken and heard and listened. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8123.745s">There's</a>  a couple ideas out on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8127.773s">personally,</a>  I think it's time to move the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8130.755s">I</a>  think that in the intervening days between this goes on, the regular meeting agenda will pay time for us to reflect and absorb what we've discussed together, what we've heard from the public, and to think about path forward that makes sense now that we have some alternative proposals for us to vote on providing different ways forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8155.686s">Sorry</a>  for my halting language, I'm like a nurse. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8159.595s">I</a>  want to again reiterate, you know, I'll probably say this the next time this comes up as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8167.73s">I</a>  do what I have the jurisdiction to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8169.371s">You</a>  know, last year, a couple times, we were given the opportunity to vote on cost of living adjustment increases to non-union personnel while there were still unions being negotiated, while there were still union contracts being negotiated. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8182.516s">And</a>  that was a discussion, which makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8183.937s">I'm</a>  glad that it was, and it was brought up for an understandable reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8188.318s">And</a>  I voted yes, because when I have the opportunity to vote yes on a raise, I'll vote yes on a raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8193.699s">And</a>  I intend to do that here, depending on what my fellow Councilors support and what we decide that the best path forward is. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8200.841s">If</a>  we had the jurisdiction to vote on raises for teachers and paras and custodians and other public servants, I would do that, but I don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8209.823s">I'll</a>  vote for the raises that I have the opportunity to support. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8214.644s">Um,</a>  and I just want to note also for folks here and folks watching, um, you know, if there are people here who don't usually attend our meetings, which, you know, I know sometimes people come to some meetings and others, it's super normal. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8227.639s">Um,</a>  this is a really unusual topic for a city council meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8232.176s">We,</a>  a lot of issues were brought up that are more of what we talked about all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8237.46s">They</a>  can store fronts, the need for commercial development the need for business development, the need to reevaluate our zoning and our housing, and all the other things that are really what we interface with as residents on a day to day basis that is the bread and butter of the city council, and that all directly feeds into. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8254.671s">the</a>  bottom line budget that affects how much we can appropriate to the schools for the schools to then appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8260.034s">Once</a>  it enters the schools, we don't touch it, except for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8264.517s">And</a>  I just also want to, while reemphasizing the validity of everything that's been said today, I believe that that work that takes up most of our time on this council exceeds by magnitudes in terms of what we can <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8280.902s">do</a>  in terms of revenue and support that feeds into necessary services in the schools and elsewhere throughout this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8288.516s">it</a>  is more impactful than what will be at maximum, a 0.05% increase over as much as four years. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8296.199s">And</a>  I don't say that to minimize the issue, the values behind the discussion are really important, but just to frame it in the larger discussion of what this council is trying to do all year long during budget season, creating more mechanisms and ordinances to bring more clarity and reality and long-term planning to our budget process, working on our commercial tax base through zoning and licensing and business development. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8318.448s">That</a>  is all part and parcel of this work, and it is, in terms of dollars, more impactful. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8328.791s">With</a>  that, I would move the question to vote on these proposals tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8332.332s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8333.692s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8334.393s">Any</a>  further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8338.434s">Councilor</a>  Callahan.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8339.947s">I'm</a>  a little bothered by the fact that it looks like in both of these proposals, the final landing pay is more than the lowest paid paraprofessional that I don't feel, unless I'm incorrect about that, that's what it looked like to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8355.319s">I</a>  won't be voting in favor of anything that puts them above a full-time paraprofessional.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8365.987s">Yeah,</a>  I don't have those contracts in front of me.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8372.093s">Councilor</a>  Tseng? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8373.574s">I</a>  don't have the contract for FY25 in front of me, but that would not be true at least for this upcoming year. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8387.446s">And</a>  it's difficult to project out in the future because there's a contract negotiation. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8394.772s">A</a>  new contract has to be agreed on in six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8399.858s">which</a>  is partially why I proposed that phase-in. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8403.899s">So</a>  instead of, the original proposal was to start immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8407.86s">This</a>  proposal builds in time for us to review all those contracts, to review the budget before we actually send out the money.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8421.513s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8421.873s">All</a>  right, seeing no further discussion on the motion to report out of committee to the regular meeting agenda, Councilor Collins' motion, which is the four-year phase-in, with the first two years being based on the COLA changes for the MTA contract, and the second two bringing it to parity with the Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8447.907s">seconded</a>  by Councilor Sagan. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8449.087s">This</a>  is to refer to the regular meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8450.488s">The</a>  process from here on out, items will be, go to the regular meeting agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8455.89s">The</a>  final votes will happen on the regular meeting agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8458.131s">So</a>  we're just reporting items out of committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8460.252s">If</a>  multiple items are reported out, multiple items will be considered on the regular meeting agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8465.234s">Since</a>  these are separate motions, they'll be considered separately. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8467.394s">So</a>  this is not the final vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8469.235s">This</a>  is just a vote to report items out of committee to our regular meeting agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8475.307s">So</a>  on the motion, Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Tseng, this is the first motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8481.051s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8492.16s">This</a>  is to put this to the next meeting.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8497.884s">This</a>  is to move this to the regular meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8499.686s">The</a>  final vote will be taken at the regular meeting.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8502.288s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8550.247s">Councilor</a>  Kelly. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=8554.639s">Yes.</a> </p>
