    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=10.494s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=14.556s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=15.317s">I'll</a>  just say present. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=17.818s">7</a>  present, none absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=22.241s">The</a>  meeting is called to order.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=28.899s">There</a>  will be a meeting of the Medford City Council Committee of the Whole on Wednesday, January 17th, 2024 at 6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=34.223s">in</a>  the Medford City Council Chamber on the second floor of Medford City Hall and via Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=38.747s">The</a>  purpose of this meeting is to discuss compensation for the Medford School Committee, paper <a href="../resolutions/23-467.pdf"><font color="green">23-467</font></a>. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=44.511s">For</a>  further information, aids, and accommodations, please contact the city clerk at 781-393-2425. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=50.796s">Sincerely</a>  yours, Isaac B. Zach Bears, Council President. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=54.579s">Thank</a>  you all for being here today. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=57.357s">We</a>  are here, as I just said, to discuss paper <a href="../resolutions/23-467.pdf"><font color="green">23-467</font></a>, a proposal from the prior council by former Council President Morell regarding the compensation of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=69.661s">Just</a>  a few things before we start. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=72.322s">Number</a>  one, Councilor Lazzaro is attending remotely tonight due to illness. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=78.723s">Hope</a>  you feel better, Councilor Lazzaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=80.204s">Thank</a>  you for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=81.584s">That</a>  means that all votes will be roll call votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=85.333s">Second,</a>  just to go quickly through, the proposal by President Morell, as amended by President Morell and Councilor Knight on December 12th, is before us tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=95.32s">Short</a>  summary is the initial proposal folks have read was to place the school committee pay at 29,359.80 cents, the chair at 32,550, vice chair at 30,640, and secretary at 31,760. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=114.751s">amendments</a>  were offered to strike several clauses regarding the composition of the Menford School Committee and City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=122.035s">Amendment</a>  was offered to phase in these adjustments over time, and Councilor Knight offered a number of amendments, including questions regarding state law, Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 44, Section 33, 71, Section 53, 71, 52, and 4433A. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=134.501s">I</a>  do have legal opinion from <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=144.622s">of</a>  the city's outside legal counsel, KP Law, which I can read into the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=150.464s">In</a>  my opinion, if there's available funding in the Medford School Department budget for this current fiscal year to pay for an improved increase in school committee compensation, then there does not need to be a supplemental appropriation request, given that the school department's fiscal year budget is a bottom line budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=165.088s">Approval</a>  of the increase would be required pursuant to general law chapter 71, section 52, <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=170.339s">given</a>  the requirements set forth in the statute as outlined below. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=173.7s">In</a>  my opinion, general laws chapter 71, section 52 govern this request, which requires generally a majority vote of the city council to change compensation for school committee members. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=184.165s">In</a>  my further opinion, in reviewing the proposal, the city council may inquire from the school department regarding funds in the fiscal year 24 budget, if any increases in approved and effective for this current fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=194.889s">If</a>  a supplemental appropriation is required, the increase would be subject <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=198.444s">to</a>  applicable municipal finance principles, including pursuant to General Law, Chapter 44, Section 33A. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=204.868s">If</a>  the City Council approves an increase to school committee compensation pursuant to General Law, Chapter 71, Section 52, to go into effect beginning July 1, 2024 for fiscal year 2025, in my opinion, such amounts would be incorporated into the bottom line budget request for fiscal year 2025 for review by the City Council, indeed under state law, <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=226.536s">And</a>  according to Desi guidance, the following provisions apply to school budgets that outlines the standard process for the setting of the budget every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=237.719s">Please</a>  let me know if there are further questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=239.16s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=240.14s">And</a>  in a sense, essentially that addresses the questions regarding whether this is subject to the provision of a two thirds vote of the council being required. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=250.555s">essentially,</a>  if a supplemental appropriation required in this were to go into effect in the middle of a fiscal year, then the answer would be yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=258.121s">If</a>  this were to go into effect on the start of a new fiscal year, then a simple majority is required under Chapter 71, Section 52. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=266.529s">And</a>  so with that, and with the amendments to the questions, I will turn it over to my fellow councilors for comment and discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=275.676s">And</a>  I see Councilor Collins and then Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=278.178s">Councilor</a>  Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=280.353s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=281.714s">Thank</a>  you so much, everybody, for being here today. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=284.376s">We</a>  really appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=285.236s">A</a>  lot to discuss here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=287.978s">I</a>  just want to start by saying I know that this discussion of this in the community has surfaced some painful and necessary truths about the underfunding of the schools and the need to provide every school worker with a living wage. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=303.545s">I</a>  appreciate that that's been one of the reminders that's come out of the discussion I just want to frame with that as a reassurance that as we talk about raising compensation for school committee for the first time in 23 years that that is close on my mind to speak only for myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=322.603s">City</a>  Council is no legal authority to make allocations within the school's budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=327.505s">I'm</a>  sure that there's been times when we all wish we had that authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=330.827s">We</a>  don't have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=333.027s">This</a>  is one thing that we do have authority over. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=336.669s">The</a>  mindset that I'm coming to this discussion with is <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=341.823s">We</a>  know it's been 23 years since school committee had a cost of living adjustment or any sort of rationale for a compensation increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=350.167s">As</a>  a Councilor with a vote to change that, I feel a responsibility to change that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=354.429s">It's</a>  something that I have the responsibility to change. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=356.69s">We</a>  don't have any jurisdiction over any other salaries when it comes to the school's department. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=361.392s">This</a>  is one thing that we do have authority over. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=364.334s">And</a>  as a Councilor, knowing a bit about <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=367.375s">Our</a>  job, knowing a little bit about the school committee members job though of course, not with that level of granular detail, but knowing how hard our school committee members work as all public servants do in our various roles that are, you know, hard to compare but all contribute to. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=384.582s">necessary</a>  work of the public sphere. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=387.406s">Contemplating</a>  an increase for school committee members is something that, you know, I've gone on record and say I think that these jobs are equivalent. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=394.695s">I'd</a>  like for us to consider, you know, leveling pay between these two legislative bodies. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=401.383s">But</a>  I'm just, I'm excited to hear the perspectives of my fellow Councilors now that we've all had a few weeks to digest this and to think about the amendments that President Morell and former Councilor Knight made during our first meeting on the topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=413.006s">So</a>  I do have some proposals to bring to our discussion tonight, but I'll hold those until we hear from, you know, some of my fellow Councilors and others in the space. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=421.128s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=427.932s">Councilor</a>  Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=429.093s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=431.174s">As</a>  I said at the meeting in December, there's a lot about this proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=439.059s">At</a>  the very least, the core of this proposal, I very much agree with the principles behind it, the principles of parity, equity, the experience that <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=446.684s">The</a>  experience and time that the school committee puts into their work vis-a-vis compared to ours, and especially this idea of giving folks a chance to take part in running for and serving on the school committee, not just because of the money itself, but <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=461.901s">because</a>  it makes, not because of the money itself, but because it makes doing school can be a justifiable decision economically. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=473.145s">I</a>  think it pays attention to economic realities. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=475.786s">I</a>  said at that meeting, however, that we needed to talk through the details that, you know, I really appreciated former President Morales. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=486.009s">amendments</a>  to have us look at amounts and timing. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=490.332s">And</a>  in that spirit, I've collected some data, and in talking to folks, put together a range of different proposals as to different amounts that we could arrive at. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=501.62s">I</a>  sent the chart over to President Bears, if he can show it on the screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=508.745s">And</a>  we've also have printed copies for all the Councilors here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=534.721s">Thank</a>  you, President Ferris. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=536.363s">I</a>  know the text is a little small. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=541.411s">I'll</a>  read out the most important numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=543.534s">But</a>  essentially, this is a <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=547.242s">a</a>  listing of four alternative proposals for the school committee pay increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=554.728s">Now,</a>  I think it's really important to underscore that we're looking at a current pay of about $12,000 a year, which has not gone up since the year 2000. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=565.757s">And</a>  so the very first column is just the fiscal years. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=572.643s">The</a>  second and third columns are basically, historically, the school committee pay versus the city council member pay, which was brought up at the last meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=583.249s">Now,</a>  as you can see, the city council pay in the year 2000 was about $13,785. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=593.574s">compared</a>  to $12,000 for school committee members. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=597.878s">And</a>  over time, that disparity has grown. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=600.64s">And</a>  that was a big kind of topic of discussion at our last meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=605.472s">The</a>  first proposal is just simply following the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=609.093s">So</a>  this first proposal is different from what was on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=612.994s">The</a>  first proposal is following the percentage increases that the city council received in those years. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=620.776s">And</a>  so what I did was got the data for all the years, went through year by year, looked at the percentage increase, the percentage change, and then did calculations from the starting point of 12,000 off that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=635.299s">which</a>  would land us at approximately $25,000 and 500, a little bit over that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=639.16s">Now,</a>  the average annual percent change with that would be 3.3% compounded. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=642.561s">The</a>  total percent change is about 130%. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=644.302s">So</a>  that's if we follow the city council pay increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=660.031s">The</a>  third set of numbers is, so basically I went and requested the teacher contracts, the MTA contracts, and in talking to some teachers, this was an idea that came up was if we, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=678.26s">the</a>  school committee pay increase should look somewhat like more akin to what teachers see. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=685.064s">And</a>  so with that proposal, again, went through the years, did all the calculations, you end up at $22,000, 100, or $22,000, or 22,000, sorry, I'm too tired, $22,105.60. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=704.105s">So</a>  that's using what the numbers I found in the teacher contracts. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=709.809s">Now,</a>  obviously there's some nuance to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=711.97s">I</a>  know a school committee member put out a post talking about how we look at those numbers and how we calculate and how steps work, but this is just kind of a neutral setting. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=724.378s">I</a>  also collected the numbers for the flat 2% cost of living adjustment. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=729.949s">which</a>  would basically have us end up at $19,687.27. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=733.252s">So</a>  about $2,500 lower. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=748.28s">I</a>  was also curious about inflation and what that $12,000 would look like if we use the Department of Labor's data on the change in the consumer price index in Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=761.856s">And</a>  it actually ends up very, very, very close to the Medford Teachers Association cost of living adjustments, actually just off by $3.30. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=772.747s">And</a>  so that would basically have us end up at $22,108.69. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=784.259s">Um,</a>  there's some numbers at the bottom for different, um, different positions, chair, secretary, vice chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=790.901s">But,</a>  um, I think for the sake of this discussion, um, I think the focus should be on just the normal school committee members pay and then we can get to get those positions as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=803.405s">Um,</a>  just some food for thought, some ideas, some different ideas, um, some alternate, uh, alternate proposals to consider.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=816.531s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=817.432s">Anything</a>  else, Councilor Tseng? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=822.736s">Any</a>  councillors like to speak at this time? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=828.039s">Councilor</a>  Callahan?</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=832.026s">As</a>  a new city councillor, I would love to ask how this discussion is going to proceed. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=838.748s">So</a>  it sounds like my understanding was that there were going to be some proposals that would change either the number or the start date or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=847.91s">Are</a>  there any proposals to do that, or is this simply discussing the original?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=853.732s">At</a>  this point, councillors can either make statements or they can make motions to amend the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=865.216s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli, then Councilor Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=867.097s">I</a>  think I saw your hand, Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=868.738s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=871.879s">I</a>  think I was pretty clear at our last meeting that where I stood on this topic, I think that there are so many factors to look at this, but looking at this is more prudent and realistic. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=889.878s">process,</a>  when we look in the basic sense of the perfect world, this would be easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=899.645s">If</a>  we had unlimited funds, then we would do what we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=905.53s">But</a>  unfortunately, we're talking about a school system that right now <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=910.649s">Today</a>  is drastically underfunded. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=912.97s">And</a>  when it comes to next year's fiscal budget, we're gonna be talking about some pretty difficult decisions to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=920.033s">And</a>  those decisions are gonna be, gee, can we afford a language teacher, a foreign language teacher in the middle schools? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=929.017s">Where</a>  could we find 45, $55,000? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=930.018s">I</a>  know we could find it right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=936.112s">Let's</a>  look at the conversations. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=939.734s">Well,</a>  how do we fund these clubs? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=942.236s">All</a>  these great clubs that we started, these small stipend clubs that teachers do it for service for their children in the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=951.822s">How</a>  do we fund those? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=952.702s">Because</a>  they're gonna be on the chopping block. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=954.903s">They're</a>  gonna be cut. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=957.305s">And</a>  the question is gonna be, where do we find $36,000? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=959.066s">Right</a>  here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=964.008s">If</a>  you listen to my council colleagues, I appreciate the hard work you did, but where was this math when paraprofessionals and teachers are negotiating? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=973.452s">This</a>  is, this perception's reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=977.934s">And</a>  I think that it was brought up at the meeting when, I've had a thousand phone calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=982.655s">I</a>  think I've shared it with you people. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=984.016s">And</a>  I want you guys to understand that <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=987.358s">I</a>  will share what they've said to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=989.779s">The</a>  perception of reality that when you have an organization running for office in the city, and they run in a slate, and that slate goes on a gigantic picture all over the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1000.12s">And</a>  then as soon as the election is completed, then the word goes out that that organization is now going to support each other to raising funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1010.329s">So</a>  that's a glaring question. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1012.391s">Whether</a>  it's true or not, that's not what I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1015.894s">It's</a>  the perception of what we're trying to do here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1018.937s">Now,</a>  I've gotten a message from different members of past school committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1024.618s">I've</a>  gotten messages from present school committee members. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1027.679s">And</a>  the idea of saying, this is equitable, what we do is no different. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1032.48s">Absolutely,</a>  it's different. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1035.06s">Absolutely,</a>  it's different. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1036.18s">And</a>  no one can tell me otherwise, because I'm the only one here that has done both. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1041.561s">And</a>  I will tell you that this position <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1046.84s">has</a>  way more pressures. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1049.782s">We</a>  have way more work to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1053.584s">Every</a>  single day. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1055.425s">Now,</a>  when you think about it, what is the school committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1058.907s">The</a>  school committee is a policy making authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1062.188s">They</a>  set policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1064.75s">They</a>  set policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1066.691s">They</a>  have a superintendent that does all the work, that sets everything in motion to what the vision of this school is. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1077.87s">Is</a>  it working? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1078.971s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1079.431s">That's</a>  still out for debate. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1081.792s">But</a>  the question that I have is understanding this process today and what they're asking for today. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1088.395s">And</a>  I shared it with my colleagues today, tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1092.697s">It's</a>  very simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1093.737s">If</a>  the community didn't want this, well, you should have come out to vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1098.619s">Because</a>  there are six people from one side and one from another. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1103.359s">And</a>  the philosophy is very simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1105.321s">This</a>  is just common sense philosophy of doing the right thing today. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1109.604s">Until</a>  we have a better understanding of what our fiscal responsibilities are when it comes to the budget, we should not look at any increases like this at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1119.552s">It's</a>  borderline dangerous because what's next? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1125.937s">When</a>  I joined the school committee, it was a service-based <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1129.46s">opportunity.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1130.941s">It</a>  was for me to work and give back to my community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1134.924s">And</a>  to hear the responses, but we'll get better candidates if we get paid more. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1140.168s">Here's</a>  a here's a lightning rod to everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1143.19s">We</a>  make $28,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1143.891s">I'm</a>  not I'm not I'm not getting rich over $28,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1148.854s">So</a>  if the fantasy is a school kid member sending me messages saying that <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1153.223s">Well,</a>  it'll bring in better candidates. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1155.865s">I've</a>  worked on a school committee with great candidates. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1158.426s">I've</a>  worked for school committee members that we couldn't shine their shoes and how dedicated they were. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1167.472s">And</a>  they weren't getting a penny. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1169.753s">It</a>  was a volunteer basic process. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1173.335s">Neighborhood</a>  communities, because I did some homework too. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1177.833s">What</a>  we're asking for here is an absolute disgrace to what neighboring communities just around us get. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1184.879s">Some</a>  of those are the highest, and I think that they're bordering between $16,000 and $18,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1188.101s">That's</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1190.604s">Everybody</a>  else. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1191.224s">There</a>  are some communities that, when I brought it up, they were like, what? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1194.727s">Are</a>  you crazy? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1197.95s">To</a>  equate it as the same responsibility as what we do here is different. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1203.494s">It's</a>  not the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1205.135s">It</a>  isn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1209.614s">It</a>  just looks and it feels funny. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1213.517s">I</a>  look at the situation that we're in tonight, when we're bringing this up, and we understand the voting process now. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1219.941s">And</a>  I know some of the council wanna know where we're gonna go next with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1223.844s">And</a>  I think that, you know, is there something that we can do? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1227.727s">Yeah,</a>  you hear that the equity piece is being thrown around. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1232.87s">If</a>  that's the biggest issue, then let's correct it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1236.707s">If</a>  we make 28 and they make 12, well then why don't we all pull together, not jeopardize the funding mechanism, what we don't have at the high school right now and drop our pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1251.574s">And</a>  I don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1253.055s">I</a>  don't do it for applause or social media comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1255.996s">I'm</a>  dead serious. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1257.376s">When</a>  I started in 2008, when I ran for office, I did it because I wanted to give back to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1262.918s">And</a>  you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1264.018s">I've</a>  stood in there, I've stuck in there pretty long. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1266.538s">I've</a>  learned a lot and I've done a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1268.219s">I'm</a>  pretty satisfied that my legacy, that what I put forth to this community is something strong that my kids will look at and say, well, my dad was part of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1278.962s">And</a>  that's what it's all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1280.99s">If</a>  you're doing this, we're doing this for the money, we're in big trouble. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1286.274s">Because</a>  if that's a reality of what this body thinks of what is a successful financial situation in your homes, this isn't it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1296.842s">So</a>  I truly, I would make the motion that we look at all of our salaries and become equitable by dropping our salaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1306.409s">Because</a>  if the city council school committee, if that's the biggest issue, then let's do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1311.647s">This</a>  isn't something I'm not listen, it's not going to make or break me. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1316.729s">And</a>  I tell people it's just 8000 less than I'd have to donate. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1320.911s">And</a>  I'm sure all of you feel the same way. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1322.452s">I</a>  don't think anybody here if you've been here for a while, have seen where your money goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1326.133s">Your</a>  money doesn't go to fancy cars, doesn't go to fancy houses. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1330.095s">It</a>  usually goes back to the people that helped you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1335.063s">And</a>  that's what we're all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1337.024s">So</a>  when we sit here and talk about 100 and whatever percent raise increase, I think it's disingenuine. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1343.529s">And</a>  to be honest with you, I think it's a slap in the face for the people that are really having a very difficult time right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1350.273s">The</a>  morale in the school department is still terrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1353.356s">It's</a>  still terrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1356.398s">Our</a>  scores are very low. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1358.663s">You</a>  know, we're in flux in many different areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1363.427s">Our</a>  school facilities look terrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1366.589s">Our</a>  custodians still don't have, if they've settled a contract, it's gonna be lower than ever, or they haven't either. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1373.735s">So</a>  you still have unions out there that work every single day, that are doing the dirtiest, most disgusting work in the city, and with a smile on their face, picking up kids and hugging them after they vomit all over them. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1387.657s">But</a>  at the same time, oh, people are gonna offend that I said that, but by the way, kids vomit. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1392.962s">So</a>  we shouldn't be offended by that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1396.184s">Because,</a>  and this is funny, because the other piece of this is, I've heard from teachers, I've heard from teachers, qualified, respected, long-term educators in our system, that have been absolutely torn down <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1414.707s">by</a>  administrators and school kid members because they've come to that podium and raised an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1421.252s">That's</a>  a disgrace. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1423.434s">This</a>  is their podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1425.836s">They're</a>  taking care of our children, whether they live in Medford or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1428.798s">They're</a>  more of this community than most people. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1433.242s">So</a>  listen, we realize, and I think everybody has to realize this, the vote's gonna be the vote, and we have to move on. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1440.648s">But</a>  I think, in good faith, <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1443.806s">this</a>  council can work together to show the community, can we be responsible? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1448.792s">Can</a>  we send the right message? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1450.714s">And</a>  is the right message to give an increase at this amount? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1454.118s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1455.339s">Do</a>  I think that that <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1458.058s">and</a>  in reality of life that we haven't touched there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1461.181s">They</a>  haven't, the school committee hasn't gotten an increase since I believe, yeah, I was there in 2008 and eight, six years before that, we didn't get that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1469.267s">But</a>  I tell you what, George Scarpelli didn't care. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1471.969s">Ann</a>  Marie Cuno didn't care. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1473.451s">Paulette</a>  Van der Kloot didn't care. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1475.112s">Billy</a>  O'Keefe didn't care. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1476.653s">John</a>  Falco didn't care. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1478.515s">Mayor</a>  Michael J. McGlynn didn't care. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1480.396s">We</a>  went to work every day for our city and we did a lot of great things. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1485.046s">So</a>  be careful what we do, because once we open this can, guess what's going to happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1489.65s">Do</a>  you know how many committees, commissions we have in this city? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1494.734s">What's</a>  to say we can't look at what they're doing and saying, well, we've got to compensate them now. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1500.278s">So</a>  careful of what we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1503.18s">If</a>  we, like I said, if we had an abundance of funds, then maybe we can look at and working it together and try to build it up slowly. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1511.527s">When</a>  we're talking about, and we all heard it, everybody heard it, let's all be realist here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1516.59s">The</a>  next year's budget, when we sit together, when we lose ESSER money, and we look at what the ARPA money we've lost, and we look at the positions that those funds hold for us, we're gonna be in deep, deep trouble. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1531.553s">And</a>  I'm gonna tell you, I'm like, listen, I've only, I know I could speak, but I've told you guys, I've really pushed in things that I've seen just by being part of this community for so long. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1546.103s">You</a>  saw how it worked with the city solicitors. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1549.005s">You</a>  saw how it worked with the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1551.987s">It's</a>  just not equitable. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1553.868s">Be</a>  smart, be prudent, and use common sense with these issues when I say, <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1561.383s">Maybe</a>  it's not fair, but they ran. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1565.447s">They</a>  ran for office at $12,000 as a payee. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1569.171s">That's</a>  what they ran for. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1572.134s">So</a>  that's what they should have until we make sure we know what our fiscal future looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1579.482s">Please.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1580.263s">That's</a>  all I ask this committee to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1584.62s">Councilor</a>  Callan asked a question that, where do we go from here? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1587.402s">What's</a>  the process? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1588.583s">I</a>  would hope this is still a feeling of process, because the truth of the matter is, when you have an employee, because that's what it seems like to me, when you have an employee that's come to you for a raise, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1599.411s">I'm</a>  assistant director of a program, and I've had employees come to me and say, George, I think I deserve a raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1604.875s">I</a>  said, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1606.937s">Let's</a>  sit down and talk about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1609.246s">Let's</a>  sit down at your body of work and let's sit down and talk about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1612.447s">Have</a>  any of you talked to any of the school kid members? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1615.728s">No,</a>  you've talked to all the school kid members. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1620.01s">Don't</a>  say it, careful, because you don't talk to all the school kid members. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1624.392s">Because</a>  if you really want to do some homework, you've talked to all the school kid members. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1629.874s">So</a>  my recommendation would be to have the school kid members here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1634.608s">and</a>  let's talk with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1636.53s">Because</a>  I think when you put it together and you understand, and maybe you sit and look at people eye to eye and you say, well, this is how it hurts. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1643.355s">Here's</a>  the reality of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1645.177s">The</a>  school committee knows how bad the budget is gonna be. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1647.899s">Let's</a>  be serious, they know. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1649.46s">So</a>  when you look in the school committee's eyes and say, okay, your child goes to the Brooks, your child has kindergarten AIDS. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1657.506s">With</a>  this increase, this could be the increase that avoids kindergarten AIDS next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1664.64s">That's</a>  what I'm trying to say because listen, I taught for 15 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1669.284s">I</a>  was on the school committee for eight years. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1671.566s">I've</a>  been on this committee for six years. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1674.169s">I</a>  understand how all the balls are being juggled right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1679.974s">So</a>  please don't make something that looks good on paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1683.257s">Have</a>  you make a decision because ultimately, the decisions we make tonight will affect what we do <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1691.664s">in</a>  June, in July, in August, and in September, more importantly, in such a negative manner that it will hurt us. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1701.328s">It</a>  will. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1702.068s">That's</a>  just the reality of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1703.969s">So</a>  thank you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1707.211s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1708.271s">Did</a>  I have Councilor Leming or is it Councilor Tseng? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1713.793s">Councilor</a>  Leming and Councilor Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1716.527s">I'd</a>  like to thank my colleague for his words. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1719.73s">I</a>  would tend to agree with him that the optics on this are terrible when teachers that are underpaid see the headline, politicians are looking to increase other politicians salaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1734.884s">morale</a>  is a real issue there. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1737.487s">That</a>  and that is something that is really on my mind in this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1743.092s">Um,</a>  I personally would be more amenable to one of the, uh, to either, uh, the raised to something around 24 21,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1753.202s">Sorry,</a>  we're getting the wrong numbers on the, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1758.635s">basically</a>  the equivalent of cost of living adjustments over since fiscal year 2020 of 2 to 2.5%, which would be, I think that would be a little bit more reasonable and putting that adjustment over a period of several years in order to not strain the budget immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1779.27s">But</a>  that being said, so, <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1782.304s">The</a>  city council, the city council salaries are something that are make or break for a lot of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1789.232s">The</a>  city council right now is a majority is majority renter. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1793.617s">And</a>  so having that having <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1797.981s">the</a>  salary to be able to justify 20 plus hours of work that we put into this every week, I think, is fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1806.865s">When</a>  it comes to the school committee members, if they're putting in 20 plus hours a week, I think that in order to improve the school system, I think that a similar <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1817.79s">to</a>  be able to justify. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1818.25s">Similar</a>  compensation is fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1819.691s">We</a>  had a candidate this past time who was put it who was putting in shift work during a lot of the campaign working as a server and so having the having the salary to be able to justify the time that they put into that if we're going to expect them to put in. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1844.531s">There</a>  have been a lot of people, there are a lot of people in the city that Medford relies on who are volunteers. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1851.656s">We</a>  are, and Medford, they are the foundation of the city in a lot of ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1857.179s">Volunteerism</a>  is incredibly helpful for running the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1861.963s">It</a>  is foundational to Medford's functions. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1866.045s">But</a>  we, <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1877.048s">We</a>  can't expect to run essential functions on the back of volunteers. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1885.094s">There</a>  are people who would make great school committee members who would be willing to do it for free. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1890.758s">A</a>  lot of those people have been <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1894.142s">cornerstones</a>  of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1895.363s">A</a>  lot of them have come up against these raises, and there are a lot of people who would make great school committee members who would be completely unwilling to work for the current stipend. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1908.735s">And</a>  I think that being able to <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1913.799s">being</a>  able to raise the salaries by a certain amount would allow us to have more people at our disposal when it comes to running the school system.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1925.209s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1927.952s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1928.692s">I'm</a>  going to go to Councilor Tseng, Councilor Lazzaro, Vice President Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1931.955s">Councilor</a>  Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1932.896s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1937.759s">There</a>  are a lot of arguments that are, I think, fairly being raised, some that I don't disagree, that I don't agree as much with, but I still do believe that there's a lot of this that needs to be balanced. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1950.952s">And</a>  so I think Councilor Scarpelli's core ask, <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1954.395s">that</a>  we look at the timing so that we have a better picture of what things look like financially is not an unreasonable ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1964.685s">And</a>  that's why I would personally be in favor and I will motion <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1970.103s">later</a>  to have this, instead of having this be implemented immediately, have a proposal be implemented over the two years, which would give us time. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1985.256s">So</a>  basically, July 1st, 2024, July 1st, 2025. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=1991.645s">This</a>  would basically give us time to go through the budget process to have a better picture of what things look like at the schools before we move forward with a proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2001.95s">In</a>  the first year, I don't think that we should do the full amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2006.852s">That's</a>  my take. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2007.953s">And</a>  so I would have this be spread over a few years as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2011.574s">And</a>  that will hopefully give us more time to solidify our understanding of the picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2017.317s">I</a>  have also taken time to talk to people with a better financial picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2022.54s">And</a>  the financial picture is nuanced. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2025.241s">It</a>  basically says that we have a small, small chunk of money that we can spend, but little consensus about what that money should be spent on. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2034.426s">And</a>  it's, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2036.868s">it</a>  would be more ideal to give people across the board raises, but it's not enough money to do that structurally. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2043.414s">And</a>  so the question is, what do we do with that surplus, with that tiny surplus? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2051.503s">So</a>  that's a consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2054.286s">Ultimately,</a>  I grew up close to my teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2059.851s">I</a>  ran for city council because during the pandemic, the school's budget got cut in real terms of close to 9%. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2072.64s">I</a>  fought hard for more money for our schools successfully, but we also have to be fair to all our staff, and that includes people who run the schools as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2084.607s">I</a>  think Councilor Leming makes a great point that I see in my real life. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2090.731s">When</a>  I say that this makes running for office justifiable, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2099.477s">I</a>  think the service argument is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2102.418s">But</a>  there are tons of people who want to serve, but can't because they have to put food on their table. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2109.34s">They</a>  have to pay their rents. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2111.7s">And</a>  so they ultimately don't make that choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2115.741s">Nat</a>  cited a <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2119.002s">an</a>  example here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2121.463s">But</a>  it's a story that more often than not ends in people deciding not to run for office than to run for office. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2130.344s">With</a>  that being said, again, so in summary, I think we should discuss the phase-in over two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2137.926s">And</a>  I agree with Matt that I think we should end up around where the teachers end up. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2143.947s">I</a>  think that's only fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2144.887s">I</a>  think the logic is more sound. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2148.209s">the</a>  data is there, and so I believe that we should end up basically raising school committee pay to $22,105.60, which is basically the same increased rates as MTA cost leveling adjustments, phased over two years, going into effect July 1st of 2024 and July 1st of 2025. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2175.15s">It</a>  seems to me like the most reasonable approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2179.692s">It's</a>  a compromise that not many people are going to be happy with, but that's the nature of compromises, and I think everyone can find some progress in that deal being made. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2190.818s">Um,</a>  and I think we should discuss that proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2195.14s">I</a>  think it's more palatable. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2197.401s">I</a>  think it gives us more room to, um, to look at our picture and look at what, um, what the picture looks like going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2207.206s">And</a>  I would be happy to motion now, but I am also happy to have a discussion first about it.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2215.911s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2216.151s">Answer</a>  saying Councilor Lazzaro.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2220.796s">Thank</a>  you and I appreciate everybody's flexibility with me being on zoom today. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2227.462s">There</a>  are just two things I wanted to mention. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2232.227s">This</a>  has been touched upon, but I think that the an important thing to acknowledge is that. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2239.594s">Many</a>  of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2241.114s">Well,</a>  I think all of us ran for office because of the value we have for the city and because we care a lot about our community, and because we have a certain level of love and care for our community members, but <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2259.648s">If</a>  these positions are all volunteer positions, it requires people to have enough personal income to not require an additional income source. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2271.412s">And</a>  that requires a baseline level of income. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2276.334s">And</a>  I don't think that's representative of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2279.235s">And</a>  I think we should just consider that one aspect of making sure that we're really <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2286.718s">having</a>  people representing the city that that truly represent the people that live here. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2291.744s">The</a>  second thing I want to make note of is that just because other communities other surrounding communities are not paying their school committee members the same as they're paying their city Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2303.337s">And</a>  I would respectfully disagree with Councilor Scarpelli I worked as the executive assistant to Superintendent Edouard-Vincent for a few years and with not this current city council but a city council a couple of years ago, that was made up of many of the same folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2321.574s">And</a>  they work a tremendous amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2323.676s">They</a>  were incredibly hardworking. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2325.977s">I</a>  can tell you because I had to go to all the meetings, and it was a lot of meetings, and there are a lot of subcommittees and Committee of the Whole meetings every week. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2334.443s">So</a>  it's, they're very hardworking. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2337.685s">I'm</a>  not sure how it was when Councilor Scarpelli was on the school committee, but <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2342.789s">I</a>  will say that just because other communities aren't maybe necessarily doing the right thing by paying their school committee members the same that they're paying their city councilors doesn't mean that we shouldn't do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2353.117s">I</a>  think being a leader in a group is a great thing to be and leading the way and saying, hey, these two bodies are <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2363.164s">equivalent</a>  in the accomplishments and the work that they're doing, and that's something that we're acknowledging and valuing, then I think that's something that we can stand up for.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/dymGDMprwPs&t=2376.871s">I'll</a>  go to Councilor Scrivelly, but if we could keep it short.</p>
