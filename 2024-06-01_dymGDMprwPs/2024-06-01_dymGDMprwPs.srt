1
00:00:00,848 --> 00:00:01,789
[SPEAKER_06]: You got it.

2

00:00:08,653 --> 00:00:09,953

4
00:00:10,494 --> 00:00:14,156
[SPEAKER_18]: Present.

5
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:14,836
[SPEAKER_18]: Present.

6
00:00:15,317 --> 00:00:17,798
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll just say present.

7
00:00:17,818 --> 00:00:22,221
[SPEAKER_18]: 7 present, none absent.

8
00:00:22,241 --> 00:00:23,561
[SPEAKER_18]: The meeting is called to order.

9
00:00:28,899 --> 00:00:34,183
[SPEAKER_06]: There will be a meeting of the Medford City Council Committee of the Whole on Wednesday, January 17th, 2024 at 6 p.m.

10
00:00:34,223 --> 00:00:38,266
[SPEAKER_06]: in the Medford City Council Chamber on the second floor of Medford City Hall and via Zoom.

11
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:44,071
[SPEAKER_06]: The purpose of this meeting is to discuss compensation for the Medford School Committee, paper 23-467.

12
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:49,515
[SPEAKER_06]: For further information, aids, and accommodations, please contact the city clerk at 781-393-2425.

13
00:00:50,796 --> 00:00:53,939
[SPEAKER_06]: Sincerely yours, Isaac B. Zach Bears, Council President.

14
00:00:54,579 --> 00:00:56,381
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you all for being here today.

15
00:00:57,357 --> 00:01:09,141
[SPEAKER_06]: We are here, as I just said, to discuss paper 23-467, a proposal from the prior council by former Council President Morell regarding the compensation of the school committee.

16
00:01:09,661 --> 00:01:11,201
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a few things before we start.

17
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:17,623
[SPEAKER_06]: Number one, Councilor Lazzaro is attending remotely tonight due to illness.

18
00:01:18,723 --> 00:01:20,164
[SPEAKER_06]: Hope you feel better, Councilor Lazzaro.

19
00:01:20,204 --> 00:01:21,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for being here.

20
00:01:21,584 --> 00:01:23,465
[SPEAKER_06]: That means that all votes will be roll call votes.

21
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:35,220
[SPEAKER_06]: Second, just to go quickly through, the proposal by President Morell, as amended by President Morell and Councilor Knight on December 12th, is before us tonight.

22
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:44,307
[SPEAKER_06]: Short summary is the initial proposal folks have read was to place the school committee pay at 29,359.80 cents, the chair at 32,550, vice chair at 30,640, and secretary at 31,760.

23
00:01:54,751 --> 00:02:01,254
[SPEAKER_06]: amendments were offered to strike several clauses regarding the composition of the Menford School Committee and City Council.

24
00:02:02,035 --> 00:02:14,441
[SPEAKER_06]: Amendment was offered to phase in these adjustments over time, and Councilor Knight offered a number of amendments, including questions regarding state law, Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 44, Section 33, 71, Section 53, 71, 52, and 4433A.

25
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:16,182
[SPEAKER_06]: I do have legal opinion from

26
00:02:24,622 --> 00:02:29,683
[SPEAKER_06]: of the city's outside legal counsel, KP Law, which I can read into the record.

27
00:02:30,464 --> 00:02:44,528
[SPEAKER_06]: In my opinion, if there's available funding in the Medford School Department budget for this current fiscal year to pay for an improved increase in school committee compensation, then there does not need to be a supplemental appropriation request, given that the school department's fiscal year budget is a bottom line budget.

28
00:02:45,088 --> 00:02:48,369
[SPEAKER_06]: Approval of the increase would be required pursuant to general law chapter 71, section 52,

29
00:02:50,339 --> 00:02:53,180
[SPEAKER_06]: given the requirements set forth in the statute as outlined below.

30
00:02:53,700 --> 00:03:03,104
[SPEAKER_06]: In my opinion, general laws chapter 71, section 52 govern this request, which requires generally a majority vote of the city council to change compensation for school committee members.

31
00:03:04,165 --> 00:03:14,609
[SPEAKER_06]: In my further opinion, in reviewing the proposal, the city council may inquire from the school department regarding funds in the fiscal year 24 budget, if any increases in approved and effective for this current fiscal year.

32
00:03:14,889 --> 00:03:17,850
[SPEAKER_06]: If a supplemental appropriation is required, the increase would be subject

33
00:03:18,444 --> 00:03:24,068
[SPEAKER_06]: to applicable municipal finance principles, including pursuant to General Law, Chapter 44, Section 33A.

34
00:03:24,868 --> 00:03:46,103
[SPEAKER_06]: If the City Council approves an increase to school committee compensation pursuant to General Law, Chapter 71, Section 52, to go into effect beginning July 1, 2024 for fiscal year 2025, in my opinion, such amounts would be incorporated into the bottom line budget request for fiscal year 2025 for review by the City Council, indeed under state law,

35
00:03:46,536 --> 00:03:56,679
[SPEAKER_06]: And according to Desi guidance, the following provisions apply to school budgets that outlines the standard process for the setting of the budget every year.

36
00:03:57,719 --> 00:03:59,100
[SPEAKER_06]: Please let me know if there are further questions.

37
00:03:59,160 --> 00:03:59,600
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

38
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:09,923
[SPEAKER_06]: And in a sense, essentially that addresses the questions regarding whether this is subject to the provision of a two thirds vote of the council being required.

39
00:04:10,555 --> 00:04:17,501
[SPEAKER_06]: essentially, if a supplemental appropriation required in this were to go into effect in the middle of a fiscal year, then the answer would be yes.

40
00:04:18,121 --> 00:04:25,047
[SPEAKER_06]: If this were to go into effect on the start of a new fiscal year, then a simple majority is required under Chapter 71, Section 52.

41
00:04:26,529 --> 00:04:35,636
[SPEAKER_06]: And so with that, and with the amendments to the questions, I will turn it over to my fellow councilors for comment and discussion.

42
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:37,878
[SPEAKER_06]: And I see Councilor Collins and then Councilor Tseng.

43
00:04:38,178 --> 00:04:38,819
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Collins.

44
00:04:40,353 --> 00:04:41,194
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, President Bears.

45
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:44,335
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you so much, everybody, for being here today.

46
00:04:44,376 --> 00:04:45,216
[SPEAKER_23]: We really appreciate it.

47
00:04:45,236 --> 00:04:47,958
[SPEAKER_23]: A lot to discuss here.

48
00:04:47,978 --> 00:05:01,686
[SPEAKER_23]: I just want to start by saying I know that this discussion of this in the community has surfaced some painful and necessary truths about the underfunding of the schools and the need to provide every school worker with a living wage.

49
00:05:03,545 --> 00:05:19,091
[SPEAKER_23]: I appreciate that that's been one of the reminders that's come out of the discussion I just want to frame with that as a reassurance that as we talk about raising compensation for school committee for the first time in 23 years that that is close on my mind to speak only for myself.

50
00:05:22,603 --> 00:05:27,465
[SPEAKER_23]: City Council is no legal authority to make allocations within the school's budget.

51
00:05:27,505 --> 00:05:30,727
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm sure that there's been times when we all wish we had that authority.

52
00:05:30,827 --> 00:05:31,567
[SPEAKER_23]: We don't have it.

53
00:05:33,027 --> 00:05:34,928
[SPEAKER_23]: This is one thing that we do have authority over.

54
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:40,611
[SPEAKER_23]: The mindset that I'm coming to this discussion with is

55
00:05:41,823 --> 00:05:49,407
[SPEAKER_23]: We know it's been 23 years since school committee had a cost of living adjustment or any sort of rationale for a compensation increase.

56
00:05:50,167 --> 00:05:54,409
[SPEAKER_23]: As a Councilor with a vote to change that, I feel a responsibility to change that.

57
00:05:54,429 --> 00:05:56,210
[SPEAKER_23]: It's something that I have the responsibility to change.

58
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:01,092
[SPEAKER_23]: We don't have any jurisdiction over any other salaries when it comes to the school's department.

59
00:06:01,392 --> 00:06:03,033
[SPEAKER_23]: This is one thing that we do have authority over.

60
00:06:04,334 --> 00:06:06,475
[SPEAKER_23]: And as a Councilor, knowing a bit about

61
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:23,252
[SPEAKER_23]: Our job, knowing a little bit about the school committee members job though of course, not with that level of granular detail, but knowing how hard our school committee members work as all public servants do in our various roles that are, you know, hard to compare but all contribute to.

62
00:06:24,582 --> 00:06:25,844
[SPEAKER_23]: necessary work of the public sphere.

63
00:06:27,406 --> 00:06:34,254
[SPEAKER_23]: Contemplating an increase for school committee members is something that, you know, I've gone on record and say I think that these jobs are equivalent.

64
00:06:34,695 --> 00:06:39,601
[SPEAKER_23]: I'd like for us to consider, you know, leveling pay between these two legislative bodies.

65
00:06:41,383 --> 00:06:52,926
[SPEAKER_23]: But I'm just, I'm excited to hear the perspectives of my fellow Councilors now that we've all had a few weeks to digest this and to think about the amendments that President Morell and former Councilor Knight made during our first meeting on the topic.

66
00:06:53,006 --> 00:07:00,928
[SPEAKER_23]: So I do have some proposals to bring to our discussion tonight, but I'll hold those until we hear from, you know, some of my fellow Councilors and others in the space.

67
00:07:01,128 --> 00:07:01,348
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

68
00:07:07,932 --> 00:07:08,552
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Tseng.

69
00:07:09,093 --> 00:07:10,374
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, President Barras.

70
00:07:11,174 --> 00:07:17,458
[SPEAKER_08]: As I said at the meeting in December, there's a lot about this proposal.

71
00:07:19,059 --> 00:07:25,383
[SPEAKER_08]: At the very least, the core of this proposal, I very much agree with the principles behind it, the principles of parity, equity, the experience that

72
00:07:26,684 --> 00:07:41,421
[SPEAKER_08]: The experience and time that the school committee puts into their work vis-a-vis compared to ours, and especially this idea of giving folks a chance to take part in running for and serving on the school committee, not just because of the money itself, but

73
00:07:41,901 --> 00:07:52,185
[SPEAKER_08]: because it makes, not because of the money itself, but because it makes doing school can be a justifiable decision economically.

74
00:07:53,145 --> 00:07:55,346
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it pays attention to economic realities.

75
00:07:55,786 --> 00:08:04,369
[SPEAKER_08]: I said at that meeting, however, that we needed to talk through the details that, you know, I really appreciated former President Morales.

76
00:08:06,009 --> 00:08:09,732
[SPEAKER_08]: amendments to have us look at amounts and timing.

77
00:08:10,332 --> 00:08:20,820
[SPEAKER_08]: And in that spirit, I've collected some data, and in talking to folks, put together a range of different proposals as to different amounts that we could arrive at.

78
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:27,304
[SPEAKER_08]: I sent the chart over to President Bears, if he can show it on the screen.

79
00:08:28,745 --> 00:08:32,288
[SPEAKER_08]: And we've also have printed copies for all the Councilors here.

80
00:08:54,721 --> 00:08:56,103
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, President Ferris.

81
00:08:56,363 --> 00:09:01,290
[SPEAKER_08]: I know the text is a little small.

82
00:09:01,411 --> 00:09:03,033
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll read out the most important numbers.

83
00:09:03,534 --> 00:09:05,897
[SPEAKER_08]: But essentially, this is a

84
00:09:07,242 --> 00:09:14,648
[SPEAKER_08]: a listing of four alternative proposals for the school committee pay increase.

85
00:09:14,728 --> 00:09:24,536
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, I think it's really important to underscore that we're looking at a current pay of about $12,000 a year, which has not gone up since the year 2000.

86
00:09:25,757 --> 00:09:31,682
[SPEAKER_08]: And so the very first column is just the fiscal years.

87
00:09:32,643 --> 00:09:42,128
[SPEAKER_08]: The second and third columns are basically, historically, the school committee pay versus the city council member pay, which was brought up at the last meeting.

88
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:48,472
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, as you can see, the city council pay in the year 2000 was about $13,785.

89
00:09:53,574 --> 00:09:56,837
[SPEAKER_08]: compared to $12,000 for school committee members.

90
00:09:57,878 --> 00:09:59,900
[SPEAKER_08]: And over time, that disparity has grown.

91
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,664
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was a big kind of topic of discussion at our last meeting.

92
00:10:05,472 --> 00:10:08,973
[SPEAKER_08]: The first proposal is just simply following the council.

93
00:10:09,093 --> 00:10:12,514
[SPEAKER_08]: So this first proposal is different from what was on the agenda.

94
00:10:12,994 --> 00:10:19,755
[SPEAKER_08]: The first proposal is following the percentage increases that the city council received in those years.

95
00:10:20,776 --> 00:10:34,059
[SPEAKER_08]: And so what I did was got the data for all the years, went through year by year, looked at the percentage increase, the percentage change, and then did calculations from the starting point of 12,000 off that.

96
00:10:35,299 --> 00:10:39,080
[SPEAKER_08]: which would land us at approximately $25,000 and 500, a little bit over that.

97
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:42,541
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, the average annual percent change with that would be 3.3% compounded.

98
00:10:42,561 --> 00:10:44,262
[SPEAKER_08]: The total percent change is about 130%.

99
00:10:44,302 --> 00:10:46,802
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's if we follow the city council pay increase.

100
00:11:00,031 --> 00:11:17,680
[SPEAKER_08]: The third set of numbers is, so basically I went and requested the teacher contracts, the MTA contracts, and in talking to some teachers, this was an idea that came up was if we, you know,

101
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:24,484
[SPEAKER_08]: the school committee pay increase should look somewhat like more akin to what teachers see.

102
00:11:25,064 --> 00:11:32,649
[SPEAKER_08]: And so with that proposal, again, went through the years, did all the calculations, you end up at $22,000, 100, or $22,000, or 22,000, sorry, I'm too tired, $22,105.60.

103
00:11:44,105 --> 00:11:49,769
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's using what the numbers I found in the teacher contracts.

104
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:51,550
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, obviously there's some nuance to that.

105
00:11:51,970 --> 00:12:02,417
[SPEAKER_08]: I know a school committee member put out a post talking about how we look at those numbers and how we calculate and how steps work, but this is just kind of a neutral setting.

106
00:12:04,378 --> 00:12:08,961
[SPEAKER_08]: I also collected the numbers for the flat 2% cost of living adjustment.

107
00:12:09,949 --> 00:12:13,012
[SPEAKER_08]: which would basically have us end up at $19,687.27.

108
00:12:13,252 --> 00:12:14,413
[SPEAKER_08]: So about $2,500 lower.

109
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:40,667
[SPEAKER_08]: I was also curious about inflation and what that $12,000 would look like if we use the Department of Labor's data on the change in the consumer price index in Boston.

110
00:12:41,856 --> 00:12:52,707
[SPEAKER_08]: And it actually ends up very, very, very close to the Medford Teachers Association cost of living adjustments, actually just off by $3.30.

111
00:12:52,747 --> 00:12:55,450
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that would basically have us end up at $22,108.69.

112
00:13:04,259 --> 00:13:10,421
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, there's some numbers at the bottom for different, um, different positions, chair, secretary, vice chair.

113
00:13:10,901 --> 00:13:22,664
[SPEAKER_08]: But, um, I think for the sake of this discussion, um, I think the focus should be on just the normal school committee members pay and then we can get to get those positions as well.

114
00:13:23,405 --> 00:13:31,427
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, just some food for thought, some ideas, some different ideas, um, some alternate, uh, alternate proposals to consider.

115
00:13:36,531 --> 00:13:37,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

116
00:13:37,432 --> 00:13:38,693
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything else, Councilor Tseng?

117
00:13:42,736 --> 00:13:44,437
[SPEAKER_06]: Any councillors like to speak at this time?

118
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:48,680
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Callahan?

119
00:13:52,026 --> 00:13:58,688
[SPEAKER_15]: As a new city councillor, I would love to ask how this discussion is going to proceed.

120
00:13:58,748 --> 00:14:07,530
[SPEAKER_15]: So it sounds like my understanding was that there were going to be some proposals that would change either the number or the start date or something like that.

121
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:11,391
[SPEAKER_16]: Are there any proposals to do that, or is this simply discussing the original?

122
00:14:13,732 --> 00:14:20,014
[SPEAKER_06]: At this point, councillors can either make statements or they can make motions to amend the paper.

123
00:14:25,216 --> 00:14:27,077
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli, then Councilor Leming.

124
00:14:27,097 --> 00:14:28,678
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I saw your hand, Councilor Scarpelli.

125
00:14:28,738 --> 00:14:29,758
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

126
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:47,706
[SPEAKER_17]: I think I was pretty clear at our last meeting that where I stood on this topic, I think that there are so many factors to look at this, but looking at this is more prudent and realistic.

127
00:14:49,878 --> 00:14:58,985
[SPEAKER_17]: process, when we look in the basic sense of the perfect world, this would be easy.

128
00:14:59,645 --> 00:15:03,068
[SPEAKER_17]: If we had unlimited funds, then we would do what we need to do.

129
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:09,472
[SPEAKER_17]: But unfortunately, we're talking about a school system that right now

130
00:15:10,649 --> 00:15:12,670
[SPEAKER_17]: Today is drastically underfunded.

131
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:19,313
[SPEAKER_17]: And when it comes to next year's fiscal budget, we're gonna be talking about some pretty difficult decisions to make.

132
00:15:20,033 --> 00:15:27,877
[SPEAKER_17]: And those decisions are gonna be, gee, can we afford a language teacher, a foreign language teacher in the middle schools?

133
00:15:29,017 --> 00:15:29,958
[SPEAKER_17]: Where could we find 45, $55,000?

134
00:15:30,018 --> 00:15:31,639
[SPEAKER_17]: I know we could find it right here.

135
00:15:36,112 --> 00:15:39,134
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's look at the conversations.

136
00:15:39,734 --> 00:15:41,415
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, how do we fund these clubs?

137
00:15:42,236 --> 00:15:50,821
[SPEAKER_17]: All these great clubs that we started, these small stipend clubs that teachers do it for service for their children in the schools.

138
00:15:51,822 --> 00:15:52,662
[SPEAKER_17]: How do we fund those?

139
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:54,343
[SPEAKER_17]: Because they're gonna be on the chopping block.

140
00:15:54,903 --> 00:15:55,524
[SPEAKER_17]: They're gonna be cut.

141
00:15:57,305 --> 00:15:58,966
[SPEAKER_17]: And the question is gonna be, where do we find $36,000?

142
00:15:59,066 --> 00:15:59,326
[SPEAKER_17]: Right here.

143
00:16:04,008 --> 00:16:11,251
[SPEAKER_17]: If you listen to my council colleagues, I appreciate the hard work you did, but where was this math when paraprofessionals and teachers are negotiating?

144
00:16:13,452 --> 00:16:16,873
[SPEAKER_17]: This is, this perception's reality.

145
00:16:17,934 --> 00:16:22,615
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think that it was brought up at the meeting when, I've had a thousand phone calls.

146
00:16:22,655 --> 00:16:23,976
[SPEAKER_17]: I think I've shared it with you people.

147
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:26,217
[SPEAKER_17]: And I want you guys to understand that

148
00:16:27,358 --> 00:16:28,859
[SPEAKER_17]: I will share what they've said to me.

149
00:16:29,779 --> 00:16:39,343
[SPEAKER_17]: The perception of reality that when you have an organization running for office in the city, and they run in a slate, and that slate goes on a gigantic picture all over the city.

150
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:50,229
[SPEAKER_17]: And then as soon as the election is completed, then the word goes out that that organization is now going to support each other to raising funds.

151
00:16:50,329 --> 00:16:52,371
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's a glaring question.

152
00:16:52,391 --> 00:16:55,094
[SPEAKER_17]: Whether it's true or not, that's not what I'm saying.

153
00:16:55,894 --> 00:16:58,116
[SPEAKER_17]: It's the perception of what we're trying to do here.

154
00:16:58,937 --> 00:17:04,118
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, I've gotten a message from different members of past school committees.

155
00:17:04,618 --> 00:17:06,999
[SPEAKER_17]: I've gotten messages from present school committee members.

156
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:12,219
[SPEAKER_17]: And the idea of saying, this is equitable, what we do is no different.

157
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,680
[SPEAKER_17]: Absolutely, it's different.

158
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,100
[SPEAKER_17]: Absolutely, it's different.

159
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:20,361
[SPEAKER_17]: And no one can tell me otherwise, because I'm the only one here that has done both.

160
00:17:21,561 --> 00:17:25,222
[SPEAKER_17]: And I will tell you that this position

161
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,281
[SPEAKER_17]: has way more pressures.

162
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:31,302
[SPEAKER_17]: We have way more work to do.

163
00:17:33,584 --> 00:17:34,444
[SPEAKER_17]: Every single day.

164
00:17:35,425 --> 00:17:38,206
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, when you think about it, what is the school committee?

165
00:17:38,907 --> 00:17:41,688
[SPEAKER_17]: The school committee is a policy making authority.

166
00:17:42,188 --> 00:17:43,009
[SPEAKER_17]: They set policy.

167
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:45,610
[SPEAKER_17]: They set policy.

168
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:54,415
[SPEAKER_17]: They have a superintendent that does all the work, that sets everything in motion to what the vision of this school is.

169
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:58,870
[SPEAKER_17]: Is it working?

170
00:17:58,971 --> 00:17:59,371
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know.

171
00:17:59,431 --> 00:18:00,791
[SPEAKER_17]: That's still out for debate.

172
00:18:01,792 --> 00:18:07,594
[SPEAKER_17]: But the question that I have is understanding this process today and what they're asking for today.

173
00:18:08,395 --> 00:18:11,256
[SPEAKER_17]: And I shared it with my colleagues today, tonight.

174
00:18:12,697 --> 00:18:13,397
[SPEAKER_17]: It's very simple.

175
00:18:13,737 --> 00:18:17,619
[SPEAKER_17]: If the community didn't want this, well, you should have come out to vote.

176
00:18:18,619 --> 00:18:21,861
[SPEAKER_17]: Because there are six people from one side and one from another.

177
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,780
[SPEAKER_17]: And the philosophy is very simple.

178
00:18:25,321 --> 00:18:28,863
[SPEAKER_17]: This is just common sense philosophy of doing the right thing today.

179
00:18:29,604 --> 00:18:38,251
[SPEAKER_17]: Until we have a better understanding of what our fiscal responsibilities are when it comes to the budget, we should not look at any increases like this at all.

180
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:44,756
[SPEAKER_17]: It's borderline dangerous because what's next?

181
00:18:45,937 --> 00:18:48,359
[SPEAKER_17]: When I joined the school committee, it was a service-based

182
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,061
[SPEAKER_17]: opportunity.

183
00:18:50,941 --> 00:18:53,783
[SPEAKER_17]: It was for me to work and give back to my community.

184
00:18:54,924 --> 00:18:59,227
[SPEAKER_17]: And to hear the responses, but we'll get better candidates if we get paid more.

185
00:19:00,168 --> 00:19:02,129
[SPEAKER_17]: Here's a here's a lightning rod to everybody.

186
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:03,510
[SPEAKER_17]: We make $28,000.

187
00:19:03,891 --> 00:19:08,474
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not I'm not I'm not getting rich over $28,000.

188
00:19:08,854 --> 00:19:12,177
[SPEAKER_17]: So if the fantasy is a school kid member sending me messages saying that

189
00:19:13,223 --> 00:19:15,584
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, it'll bring in better candidates.

190
00:19:15,865 --> 00:19:17,966
[SPEAKER_17]: I've worked on a school committee with great candidates.

191
00:19:18,426 --> 00:19:26,231
[SPEAKER_17]: I've worked for school committee members that we couldn't shine their shoes and how dedicated they were.

192
00:19:27,472 --> 00:19:28,552
[SPEAKER_17]: And they weren't getting a penny.

193
00:19:29,753 --> 00:19:32,415
[SPEAKER_17]: It was a volunteer basic process.

194
00:19:33,335 --> 00:19:35,977
[SPEAKER_17]: Neighborhood communities, because I did some homework too.

195
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:44,118
[SPEAKER_17]: What we're asking for here is an absolute disgrace to what neighboring communities just around us get.

196
00:19:44,879 --> 00:19:47,761
[SPEAKER_17]: Some of those are the highest, and I think that they're bordering between $16,000 and $18,000.

197
00:19:48,101 --> 00:19:50,083
[SPEAKER_17]: That's it.

198
00:19:50,604 --> 00:19:51,204
[SPEAKER_17]: Everybody else.

199
00:19:51,224 --> 00:19:54,046
[SPEAKER_17]: There are some communities that, when I brought it up, they were like, what?

200
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:55,528
[SPEAKER_17]: Are you crazy?

201
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:02,934
[SPEAKER_17]: To equate it as the same responsibility as what we do here is different.

202
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:04,575
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not the same.

203
00:20:05,135 --> 00:20:05,476
[SPEAKER_17]: It isn't.

204
00:20:09,614 --> 00:20:12,516
[SPEAKER_17]: It just looks and it feels funny.

205
00:20:13,517 --> 00:20:19,261
[SPEAKER_17]: I look at the situation that we're in tonight, when we're bringing this up, and we understand the voting process now.

206
00:20:19,941 --> 00:20:23,003
[SPEAKER_17]: And I know some of the council wanna know where we're gonna go next with this.

207
00:20:23,844 --> 00:20:27,627
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think that, you know, is there something that we can do?

208
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:31,089
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, you hear that the equity piece is being thrown around.

209
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:35,232
[SPEAKER_17]: If that's the biggest issue, then let's correct it.

210
00:20:36,707 --> 00:20:48,892
[SPEAKER_17]: If we make 28 and they make 12, well then why don't we all pull together, not jeopardize the funding mechanism, what we don't have at the high school right now and drop our pay.

211
00:20:51,574 --> 00:20:51,954
[SPEAKER_17]: And I don't.

212
00:20:53,055 --> 00:20:55,676
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't do it for applause or social media comments.

213
00:20:55,996 --> 00:20:56,816
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm dead serious.

214
00:20:57,376 --> 00:21:02,337
[SPEAKER_17]: When I started in 2008, when I ran for office, I did it because I wanted to give back to the community.

215
00:21:02,918 --> 00:21:03,398
[SPEAKER_17]: And you know what?

216
00:21:04,018 --> 00:21:05,958
[SPEAKER_17]: I've stood in there, I've stuck in there pretty long.

217
00:21:06,538 --> 00:21:07,799
[SPEAKER_17]: I've learned a lot and I've done a lot.

218
00:21:08,219 --> 00:21:18,942
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm pretty satisfied that my legacy, that what I put forth to this community is something strong that my kids will look at and say, well, my dad was part of that.

219
00:21:18,962 --> 00:21:19,742
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's what it's all about.

220
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:25,473
[SPEAKER_17]: If you're doing this, we're doing this for the money, we're in big trouble.

221
00:21:26,274 --> 00:21:35,541
[SPEAKER_17]: Because if that's a reality of what this body thinks of what is a successful financial situation in your homes, this isn't it.

222
00:21:36,842 --> 00:21:45,168
[SPEAKER_17]: So I truly, I would make the motion that we look at all of our salaries and become equitable by dropping our salaries.

223
00:21:46,409 --> 00:21:50,132
[SPEAKER_17]: Because if the city council school committee, if that's the biggest issue, then let's do that.

224
00:21:51,647 --> 00:21:55,229
[SPEAKER_17]: This isn't something I'm not listen, it's not going to make or break me.

225
00:21:56,729 --> 00:21:59,430
[SPEAKER_17]: And I tell people it's just 8000 less than I'd have to donate.

226
00:22:00,911 --> 00:22:02,392
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm sure all of you feel the same way.

227
00:22:02,452 --> 00:22:06,113
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think anybody here if you've been here for a while, have seen where your money goes.

228
00:22:06,133 --> 00:22:09,495
[SPEAKER_17]: Your money doesn't go to fancy cars, doesn't go to fancy houses.

229
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:11,936
[SPEAKER_17]: It usually goes back to the people that helped you.

230
00:22:15,063 --> 00:22:16,144
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's what we're all about.

231
00:22:17,024 --> 00:22:23,389
[SPEAKER_17]: So when we sit here and talk about 100 and whatever percent raise increase, I think it's disingenuine.

232
00:22:23,529 --> 00:22:29,793
[SPEAKER_17]: And to be honest with you, I think it's a slap in the face for the people that are really having a very difficult time right now.

233
00:22:30,273 --> 00:22:32,535
[SPEAKER_17]: The morale in the school department is still terrible.

234
00:22:33,356 --> 00:22:34,156
[SPEAKER_17]: It's still terrible.

235
00:22:36,398 --> 00:22:37,659
[SPEAKER_17]: Our scores are very low.

236
00:22:38,663 --> 00:22:42,706
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, we're in flux in many different areas.

237
00:22:43,427 --> 00:22:44,988
[SPEAKER_17]: Our school facilities look terrible.

238
00:22:46,589 --> 00:22:52,494
[SPEAKER_17]: Our custodians still don't have, if they've settled a contract, it's gonna be lower than ever, or they haven't either.

239
00:22:53,735 --> 00:23:06,426
[SPEAKER_17]: So you still have unions out there that work every single day, that are doing the dirtiest, most disgusting work in the city, and with a smile on their face, picking up kids and hugging them after they vomit all over them.

240
00:23:07,657 --> 00:23:12,401
[SPEAKER_17]: But at the same time, oh, people are gonna offend that I said that, but by the way, kids vomit.

241
00:23:12,962 --> 00:23:14,243
[SPEAKER_17]: So we shouldn't be offended by that.

242
00:23:16,184 --> 00:23:31,537
[SPEAKER_17]: Because, and this is funny, because the other piece of this is, I've heard from teachers, I've heard from teachers, qualified, respected, long-term educators in our system, that have been absolutely torn down

243
00:23:34,707 --> 00:23:39,791
[SPEAKER_17]: by administrators and school kid members because they've come to that podium and raised an issue.

244
00:23:41,252 --> 00:23:42,293
[SPEAKER_17]: That's a disgrace.

245
00:23:43,434 --> 00:23:44,375
[SPEAKER_17]: This is their podium.

246
00:23:45,836 --> 00:23:48,098
[SPEAKER_17]: They're taking care of our children, whether they live in Medford or not.

247
00:23:48,798 --> 00:23:51,040
[SPEAKER_17]: They're more of this community than most people.

248
00:23:53,242 --> 00:24:00,007
[SPEAKER_17]: So listen, we realize, and I think everybody has to realize this, the vote's gonna be the vote, and we have to move on.

249
00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:02,789
[SPEAKER_17]: But I think, in good faith,

250
00:24:03,806 --> 00:24:08,331
[SPEAKER_17]: this council can work together to show the community, can we be responsible?

251
00:24:08,792 --> 00:24:10,213
[SPEAKER_17]: Can we send the right message?

252
00:24:10,714 --> 00:24:13,938
[SPEAKER_17]: And is the right message to give an increase at this amount?

253
00:24:14,118 --> 00:24:14,298
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

254
00:24:15,339 --> 00:24:17,222
[SPEAKER_17]: Do I think that that

255
00:24:18,058 --> 00:24:20,960
[SPEAKER_17]: and in reality of life that we haven't touched there.

256
00:24:21,181 --> 00:24:28,927
[SPEAKER_17]: They haven't, the school committee hasn't gotten an increase since I believe, yeah, I was there in 2008 and eight, six years before that, we didn't get that.

257
00:24:29,267 --> 00:24:31,649
[SPEAKER_17]: But I tell you what, George Scarpelli didn't care.

258
00:24:31,969 --> 00:24:33,110
[SPEAKER_17]: Ann Marie Cuno didn't care.

259
00:24:33,451 --> 00:24:34,772
[SPEAKER_17]: Paulette Van der Kloot didn't care.

260
00:24:35,112 --> 00:24:36,293
[SPEAKER_17]: Billy O'Keefe didn't care.

261
00:24:36,653 --> 00:24:37,814
[SPEAKER_17]: John Falco didn't care.

262
00:24:38,515 --> 00:24:40,096
[SPEAKER_17]: Mayor Michael J. McGlynn didn't care.

263
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:43,519
[SPEAKER_17]: We went to work every day for our city and we did a lot of great things.

264
00:24:45,046 --> 00:24:48,669
[SPEAKER_17]: So be careful what we do, because once we open this can, guess what's going to happen?

265
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:52,932
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you know how many committees, commissions we have in this city?

266
00:24:54,734 --> 00:24:58,837
[SPEAKER_17]: What's to say we can't look at what they're doing and saying, well, we've got to compensate them now.

267
00:25:00,278 --> 00:25:01,599
[SPEAKER_17]: So careful of what we do.

268
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:10,206
[SPEAKER_17]: If we, like I said, if we had an abundance of funds, then maybe we can look at and working it together and try to build it up slowly.

269
00:25:11,527 --> 00:25:15,309
[SPEAKER_17]: When we're talking about, and we all heard it, everybody heard it, let's all be realist here.

270
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:30,580
[SPEAKER_17]: The next year's budget, when we sit together, when we lose ESSER money, and we look at what the ARPA money we've lost, and we look at the positions that those funds hold for us, we're gonna be in deep, deep trouble.

271
00:25:31,553 --> 00:25:44,762
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm gonna tell you, I'm like, listen, I've only, I know I could speak, but I've told you guys, I've really pushed in things that I've seen just by being part of this community for so long.

272
00:25:46,103 --> 00:25:48,004
[SPEAKER_17]: You saw how it worked with the city solicitors.

273
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:50,466
[SPEAKER_17]: You saw how it worked with the budget.

274
00:25:51,987 --> 00:25:53,508
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just not equitable.

275
00:25:53,868 --> 00:25:58,792
[SPEAKER_17]: Be smart, be prudent, and use common sense with these issues when I say,

276
00:26:01,383 --> 00:26:03,946
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe it's not fair, but they ran.

277
00:26:05,447 --> 00:26:08,350
[SPEAKER_17]: They ran for office at $12,000 as a payee.

278
00:26:09,171 --> 00:26:10,152
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what they ran for.

279
00:26:12,134 --> 00:26:19,422
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's what they should have until we make sure we know what our fiscal future looks like.

280
00:26:19,482 --> 00:26:19,823
[SPEAKER_17]: Please.

281
00:26:20,263 --> 00:26:21,965
[SPEAKER_17]: That's all I ask this committee to do.

282
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:27,182
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Callan asked a question that, where do we go from here?

283
00:26:27,402 --> 00:26:28,103
[SPEAKER_17]: What's the process?

284
00:26:28,583 --> 00:26:39,071
[SPEAKER_17]: I would hope this is still a feeling of process, because the truth of the matter is, when you have an employee, because that's what it seems like to me, when you have an employee that's come to you for a raise, right?

285
00:26:39,411 --> 00:26:44,815
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm assistant director of a program, and I've had employees come to me and say, George, I think I deserve a raise.

286
00:26:44,875 --> 00:26:45,436
[SPEAKER_17]: I said, you know what?

287
00:26:46,937 --> 00:26:48,178
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's sit down and talk about it.

288
00:26:49,246 --> 00:26:51,967
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's sit down at your body of work and let's sit down and talk about it.

289
00:26:52,447 --> 00:26:54,388
[SPEAKER_17]: Have any of you talked to any of the school kid members?

290
00:26:55,728 --> 00:26:58,870
[SPEAKER_17]: No, you've talked to all the school kid members.

291
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:03,371
[SPEAKER_17]: Don't say it, careful, because you don't talk to all the school kid members.

292
00:27:04,392 --> 00:27:07,813
[SPEAKER_17]: Because if you really want to do some homework, you've talked to all the school kid members.

293
00:27:09,874 --> 00:27:13,255
[SPEAKER_17]: So my recommendation would be to have the school kid members here.

294
00:27:14,608 --> 00:27:15,489
[SPEAKER_17]: and let's talk with them.

295
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:23,315
[SPEAKER_17]: Because I think when you put it together and you understand, and maybe you sit and look at people eye to eye and you say, well, this is how it hurts.

296
00:27:23,355 --> 00:27:24,296
[SPEAKER_17]: Here's the reality of it.

297
00:27:25,177 --> 00:27:27,879
[SPEAKER_17]: The school committee knows how bad the budget is gonna be.

298
00:27:27,899 --> 00:27:28,799
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's be serious, they know.

299
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:35,965
[SPEAKER_17]: So when you look in the school committee's eyes and say, okay, your child goes to the Brooks, your child has kindergarten AIDS.

300
00:27:37,506 --> 00:27:42,811
[SPEAKER_17]: With this increase, this could be the increase that avoids kindergarten AIDS next year.

301
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,664
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what I'm trying to say because listen, I taught for 15 years.

302
00:27:49,284 --> 00:27:51,086
[SPEAKER_17]: I was on the school committee for eight years.

303
00:27:51,566 --> 00:27:53,188
[SPEAKER_17]: I've been on this committee for six years.

304
00:27:54,169 --> 00:27:56,751
[SPEAKER_17]: I understand how all the balls are being juggled right now.

305
00:27:59,974 --> 00:28:02,256
[SPEAKER_17]: So please don't make something that looks good on paper.

306
00:28:03,257 --> 00:28:10,584
[SPEAKER_17]: Have you make a decision because ultimately, the decisions we make tonight will affect what we do

307
00:28:11,664 --> 00:28:19,948
[SPEAKER_17]: in June, in July, in August, and in September, more importantly, in such a negative manner that it will hurt us.

308
00:28:21,328 --> 00:28:21,668
[SPEAKER_17]: It will.

309
00:28:22,068 --> 00:28:23,349
[SPEAKER_17]: That's just the reality of it.

310
00:28:23,969 --> 00:28:25,010
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you, Mr. President.

311
00:28:27,211 --> 00:28:28,251
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

312
00:28:28,271 --> 00:28:31,112
[SPEAKER_06]: Did I have Councilor Leming or is it Councilor Tseng?

313
00:28:33,793 --> 00:28:34,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Leming and Councilor Tseng.

314
00:28:36,527 --> 00:28:38,989
[SPEAKER_19]: I'd like to thank my colleague for his words.

315
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:53,062
[SPEAKER_19]: I would tend to agree with him that the optics on this are terrible when teachers that are underpaid see the headline, politicians are looking to increase other politicians salaries.

316
00:28:54,884 --> 00:28:57,106
[SPEAKER_19]: morale is a real issue there.

317
00:28:57,487 --> 00:29:02,612
[SPEAKER_19]: That and that is something that is really on my mind in this process.

318
00:29:03,092 --> 00:29:12,902
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, I personally would be more amenable to one of the, uh, to either, uh, the raised to something around 24 21,000.

319
00:29:13,202 --> 00:29:15,804
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry, we're getting the wrong numbers on the, um,

320
00:29:18,635 --> 00:29:38,689
[SPEAKER_19]: basically the equivalent of cost of living adjustments over since fiscal year 2020 of 2 to 2.5%, which would be, I think that would be a little bit more reasonable and putting that adjustment over a period of several years in order to not strain the budget immediately.

321
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:40,090
[SPEAKER_19]: But that being said, so,

322
00:29:42,304 --> 00:29:49,012
[SPEAKER_19]: The city council, the city council salaries are something that are make or break for a lot of us.

323
00:29:49,232 --> 00:29:53,177
[SPEAKER_19]: The city council right now is a majority is majority renter.

324
00:29:53,617 --> 00:29:56,921
[SPEAKER_19]: And so having that having

325
00:29:57,981 --> 00:30:06,345
[SPEAKER_19]: the salary to be able to justify 20 plus hours of work that we put into this every week, I think, is fair.

326
00:30:06,865 --> 00:30:16,589
[SPEAKER_19]: When it comes to the school committee members, if they're putting in 20 plus hours a week, I think that in order to improve the school system, I think that a similar

327
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:18,230
[SPEAKER_19]: to be able to justify.

328
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,591
[SPEAKER_19]: Similar compensation is fair.

329
00:30:19,691 --> 00:30:36,777
[SPEAKER_19]: We had a candidate this past time who was put it who was putting in shift work during a lot of the campaign working as a server and so having the having the salary to be able to justify the time that they put into that if we're going to expect them to put in.

330
00:30:44,531 --> 00:30:50,915
[SPEAKER_19]: There have been a lot of people, there are a lot of people in the city that Medford relies on who are volunteers.

331
00:30:51,656 --> 00:30:57,099
[SPEAKER_19]: We are, and Medford, they are the foundation of the city in a lot of ways.

332
00:30:57,179 --> 00:31:01,943
[SPEAKER_19]: Volunteerism is incredibly helpful for running the city.

333
00:31:01,963 --> 00:31:05,465
[SPEAKER_19]: It is foundational to Medford's functions.

334
00:31:06,045 --> 00:31:06,325
[SPEAKER_19]: But we,

335
00:31:17,048 --> 00:31:24,754
[SPEAKER_19]: We can't expect to run essential functions on the back of volunteers.

336
00:31:25,094 --> 00:31:30,318
[SPEAKER_19]: There are people who would make great school committee members who would be willing to do it for free.

337
00:31:30,758 --> 00:31:33,120
[SPEAKER_19]: A lot of those people have been

338
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:35,343
[SPEAKER_19]: cornerstones of the community.

339
00:31:35,363 --> 00:31:47,734
[SPEAKER_19]: A lot of them have come up against these raises, and there are a lot of people who would make great school committee members who would be completely unwilling to work for the current stipend.

340
00:31:48,735 --> 00:31:52,017
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think that being able to

341
00:31:53,799 --> 00:32:04,148
[SPEAKER_19]: being able to raise the salaries by a certain amount would allow us to have more people at our disposal when it comes to running the school system.

342
00:32:05,209 --> 00:32:06,530
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

343
00:32:07,952 --> 00:32:08,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Leming.

344
00:32:08,692 --> 00:32:11,915
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to go to Councilor Tseng, Councilor Lazzaro, Vice President Collins.

345
00:32:11,955 --> 00:32:12,536
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Tseng.

346
00:32:12,896 --> 00:32:13,256
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

347
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:30,351
[SPEAKER_08]: There are a lot of arguments that are, I think, fairly being raised, some that I don't disagree, that I don't agree as much with, but I still do believe that there's a lot of this that needs to be balanced.

348
00:32:30,952 --> 00:32:33,734
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I think Councilor Scarpelli's core ask,

349
00:32:34,395 --> 00:32:44,445
[SPEAKER_08]: that we look at the timing so that we have a better picture of what things look like financially is not an unreasonable ask.

350
00:32:44,685 --> 00:32:48,969
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's why I would personally be in favor and I will motion

351
00:32:50,103 --> 00:33:05,035
[SPEAKER_08]: later to have this, instead of having this be implemented immediately, have a proposal be implemented over the two years, which would give us time.

352
00:33:05,256 --> 00:33:07,317
[SPEAKER_08]: So basically, July 1st, 2024, July 1st, 2025.

353
00:33:11,645 --> 00:33:21,390
[SPEAKER_08]: This would basically give us time to go through the budget process to have a better picture of what things look like at the schools before we move forward with a proposal.

354
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:26,552
[SPEAKER_08]: In the first year, I don't think that we should do the full amount.

355
00:33:26,852 --> 00:33:27,412
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my take.

356
00:33:27,953 --> 00:33:30,894
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I would have this be spread over a few years as well.

357
00:33:31,574 --> 00:33:36,677
[SPEAKER_08]: And that will hopefully give us more time to solidify our understanding of the picture.

358
00:33:37,317 --> 00:33:41,840
[SPEAKER_08]: I have also taken time to talk to people with a better financial picture.

359
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:44,501
[SPEAKER_08]: And the financial picture is nuanced.

360
00:33:45,241 --> 00:33:54,086
[SPEAKER_08]: It basically says that we have a small, small chunk of money that we can spend, but little consensus about what that money should be spent on.

361
00:33:54,426 --> 00:33:55,607
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's, you know,

362
00:33:56,868 --> 00:34:02,694
[SPEAKER_08]: it would be more ideal to give people across the board raises, but it's not enough money to do that structurally.

363
00:34:03,414 --> 00:34:11,483
[SPEAKER_08]: And so the question is, what do we do with that surplus, with that tiny surplus?

364
00:34:11,503 --> 00:34:13,284
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's a consideration.

365
00:34:14,286 --> 00:34:19,291
[SPEAKER_08]: Ultimately, I grew up close to my teachers.

366
00:34:19,851 --> 00:34:29,921
[SPEAKER_08]: I ran for city council because during the pandemic, the school's budget got cut in real terms of close to 9%.

367
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:44,567
[SPEAKER_08]: I fought hard for more money for our schools successfully, but we also have to be fair to all our staff, and that includes people who run the schools as well.

368
00:34:44,607 --> 00:34:50,311
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Councilor Leming makes a great point that I see in my real life.

369
00:34:50,731 --> 00:34:54,353
[SPEAKER_08]: When I say that this makes running for office justifiable, right?

370
00:34:59,477 --> 00:35:01,638
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the service argument is important.

371
00:35:02,418 --> 00:35:08,819
[SPEAKER_08]: But there are tons of people who want to serve, but can't because they have to put food on their table.

372
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:11,000
[SPEAKER_08]: They have to pay their rents.

373
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:14,721
[SPEAKER_08]: And so they ultimately don't make that choice.

374
00:35:15,741 --> 00:35:16,982
[SPEAKER_08]: Nat cited a

375
00:35:19,002 --> 00:35:20,162
[SPEAKER_08]: an example here in Medford.

376
00:35:21,463 --> 00:35:29,984
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's a story that more often than not ends in people deciding not to run for office than to run for office.

377
00:35:30,344 --> 00:35:37,446
[SPEAKER_08]: With that being said, again, so in summary, I think we should discuss the phase-in over two years.

378
00:35:37,926 --> 00:35:42,867
[SPEAKER_08]: And I agree with Matt that I think we should end up around where the teachers end up.

379
00:35:43,947 --> 00:35:44,847
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's only fair.

380
00:35:44,887 --> 00:35:46,768
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the logic is more sound.

381
00:35:48,209 --> 00:36:11,127
[SPEAKER_08]: the data is there, and so I believe that we should end up basically raising school committee pay to $22,105.60, which is basically the same increased rates as MTA cost leveling adjustments, phased over two years, going into effect July 1st of 2024 and July 1st of 2025.

382
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:18,972
[SPEAKER_08]: It seems to me like the most reasonable approach.

383
00:36:19,692 --> 00:36:29,778
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a compromise that not many people are going to be happy with, but that's the nature of compromises, and I think everyone can find some progress in that deal being made.

384
00:36:30,818 --> 00:36:34,500
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and I think we should discuss that proposal.

385
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,761
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's more palatable.

386
00:36:37,401 --> 00:36:46,406
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it gives us more room to, um, to look at our picture and look at what, um, what the picture looks like going forward.

387
00:36:47,206 --> 00:36:54,350
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would be happy to motion now, but I am also happy to have a discussion first about it.

388
00:36:55,911 --> 00:36:56,131
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

389
00:36:56,151 --> 00:36:57,732
[SPEAKER_06]: Answer saying Councilor Lazzaro.

390
00:37:00,796 --> 00:37:05,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you and I appreciate everybody's flexibility with me being on zoom today.

391
00:37:07,462 --> 00:37:09,785
[SPEAKER_03]: There are just two things I wanted to mention.

392
00:37:12,227 --> 00:37:17,692
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been touched upon, but I think that the an important thing to acknowledge is that.

393
00:37:19,594 --> 00:37:20,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Many of us.

394
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:37,281
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think all of us ran for office because of the value we have for the city and because we care a lot about our community, and because we have a certain level of love and care for our community members, but

395
00:37:39,648 --> 00:37:51,132
[SPEAKER_03]: If these positions are all volunteer positions, it requires people to have enough personal income to not require an additional income source.

396
00:37:51,412 --> 00:37:55,273
[SPEAKER_03]: And that requires a baseline level of income.

397
00:37:56,334 --> 00:37:58,634
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think that's representative of the city.

398
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:05,157
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we should just consider that one aspect of making sure that we're really

399
00:38:06,718 --> 00:38:10,783
[SPEAKER_03]: having people representing the city that that truly represent the people that live here.

400
00:38:11,744 --> 00:38:21,295
[SPEAKER_03]: The second thing I want to make note of is that just because other communities other surrounding communities are not paying their school committee members the same as they're paying their city Councilors.

401
00:38:23,337 --> 00:38:40,693
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would respectfully disagree with Councilor Scarpelli I worked as the executive assistant to Superintendent Edouard-Vincent for a few years and with not this current city council but a city council a couple of years ago, that was made up of many of the same folks.

402
00:38:41,574 --> 00:38:43,535
[SPEAKER_03]: And they work a tremendous amount.

403
00:38:43,676 --> 00:38:45,937
[SPEAKER_03]: They were incredibly hardworking.

404
00:38:45,977 --> 00:38:53,802
[SPEAKER_03]: I can tell you because I had to go to all the meetings, and it was a lot of meetings, and there are a lot of subcommittees and Committee of the Whole meetings every week.

405
00:38:54,443 --> 00:38:57,385
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's, they're very hardworking.

406
00:38:57,685 --> 00:39:01,388
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure how it was when Councilor Scarpelli was on the school committee, but

407
00:39:02,789 --> 00:39:12,896
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say that just because other communities aren't maybe necessarily doing the right thing by paying their school committee members the same that they're paying their city councilors doesn't mean that we shouldn't do it.

408
00:39:13,117 --> 00:39:21,583
[SPEAKER_03]: I think being a leader in a group is a great thing to be and leading the way and saying, hey, these two bodies are

409
00:39:23,164 --> 00:39:34,049
[SPEAKER_03]: equivalent in the accomplishments and the work that they're doing, and that's something that we're acknowledging and valuing, then I think that's something that we can stand up for.

410
00:39:36,871 --> 00:39:38,672
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll go to Councilor Scrivelly, but if we could keep it short.

411
00:39:38,712 --> 00:39:50,818
[SPEAKER_17]: To the personal privilege, just to Councilor Lazzaro, when you use a person's name, and understanding what I did when I ran for office, and I was a school kid member,

412
00:39:51,735 --> 00:39:52,896
[SPEAKER_17]: We worked our tail off.

413
00:39:53,596 --> 00:39:54,737
[SPEAKER_17]: We changed policies.

414
00:39:55,277 --> 00:39:56,939
[SPEAKER_17]: We put in bullying policies.

415
00:39:57,539 --> 00:40:03,863
[SPEAKER_17]: We made sure we had new science labs, new fields, new gymnasium, new curriculum.

416
00:40:05,084 --> 00:40:06,485
[SPEAKER_17]: So we worked our tails off.

417
00:40:06,745 --> 00:40:11,829
[SPEAKER_17]: And by the way, while this council was doing that, he owned a fence company.

418
00:40:12,329 --> 00:40:13,550
[SPEAKER_17]: He owned a painting company.

419
00:40:14,431 --> 00:40:15,371
[SPEAKER_17]: He worked as a coach.

420
00:40:16,571 --> 00:40:19,673
[SPEAKER_17]: and he worked as a full-time recreation assistant director.

421
00:40:20,194 --> 00:40:44,552
[SPEAKER_17]: So I completely understand how hard it is to want to be part of a position, but when you use the name like you did and understand, I don't know what you did or what school department you work for, but I made reference to the school committee, the teaching and the city council work that I've done in this community, in the city of Medford.

422
00:40:45,973 --> 00:40:53,676
[SPEAKER_17]: So I appreciate that you have an overview of what happens in another- It was Medford, actually.

423
00:40:53,776 --> 00:40:58,777
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, in Medford, but I truly didn't even know you worked in the city.

424
00:40:59,598 --> 00:41:01,698
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you, Mr. President.

425
00:41:01,878 --> 00:41:02,739
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't all know everything.

426
00:41:02,759 --> 00:41:03,899
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

427
00:41:03,939 --> 00:41:04,719
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Collins.

428
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:07,580
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, President Bears.

429
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,781
[SPEAKER_23]: I appreciate hearing from my fellow councilors about this.

430
00:41:14,991 --> 00:41:15,911
[SPEAKER_23]: A lot to respond to.

431
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:26,157
[SPEAKER_23]: I already started out my comments with where I'm coming from in my overall approach to this issue, so I'll do my best not to reiterate myself because I don't want to bore you all.

432
00:41:27,057 --> 00:41:29,819
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm going to make a couple of proposals.

433
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:37,283
[SPEAKER_23]: First, I do just want to, I do feel like it's important to emphasize this isn't about

434
00:41:39,226 --> 00:41:40,968
[SPEAKER_23]: feel like this shouldn't be a controversial statement.

435
00:41:41,008 --> 00:41:42,509
[SPEAKER_23]: This isn't about this school committee.

436
00:41:42,769 --> 00:41:44,691
[SPEAKER_23]: This is about the school committee.

437
00:41:44,731 --> 00:41:49,035
[SPEAKER_23]: Whoever is on it, any changes that we pass will be in effect.

438
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:51,070
[SPEAKER_23]: into the future.

439
00:41:51,951 --> 00:42:06,536
[SPEAKER_23]: What, speaking only for myself, what we'll be voting on, I would vote on regardless of who was in those chairs, because I think that, and it was mentioned also tonight, compensation, the need to, sometimes it comes up, we discuss how should volunteers be compensated?

440
00:42:06,576 --> 00:42:08,396
[SPEAKER_23]: Should we compensate volunteers?

441
00:42:08,416 --> 00:42:10,137
[SPEAKER_23]: How should boards and commissions be compensated?

442
00:42:10,157 --> 00:42:16,039
[SPEAKER_23]: I have been a little bit obnoxious in saying whenever it comes up, I believe that we should compensate members of all boards and commissions.

443
00:42:16,379 --> 00:42:18,580
[SPEAKER_23]: I just bring that up to say, I think it's,

444
00:42:19,974 --> 00:42:22,238
[SPEAKER_23]: It's really understandable that these conversations get personal.

445
00:42:22,619 --> 00:42:23,560
[SPEAKER_23]: For me, this is not personal.

446
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,565
[SPEAKER_23]: This is about how I think this body should be compensated.

447
00:42:31,514 --> 00:42:32,696
[SPEAKER_23]: Moving on from that.

448
00:42:34,729 --> 00:42:39,592
[SPEAKER_23]: I appreciate Councilor Tseng's motion to raise.

449
00:42:39,892 --> 00:42:40,852
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't a formal motion.

450
00:42:40,872 --> 00:42:44,874
[SPEAKER_23]: It wasn't a formal motion, a bit of a hint of motion, pre-motion perhaps.

451
00:42:45,634 --> 00:43:02,702
[SPEAKER_23]: I appreciate Councilor Tseng's idea around raising school committee compensation to follow the same year over year percentage increases that have occurred in the MTA contract from the numbers that we received, which would arrive at that

452
00:43:03,746 --> 00:43:04,528
[SPEAKER_23]: $22,105.60 number in the year 2025.

453
00:43:13,021 --> 00:43:16,322
[SPEAKER_23]: If you make that in the form of the motion, I am happy to support that.

454
00:43:16,923 --> 00:43:18,843
[SPEAKER_23]: I like that for a couple of reasons.

455
00:43:18,863 --> 00:43:25,326
[SPEAKER_23]: One, I've made it clear I'd like to support a proposal for a school committee compensation increase.

456
00:43:25,346 --> 00:43:26,267
[SPEAKER_23]: I've been clear about that.

457
00:43:27,347 --> 00:43:37,751
[SPEAKER_23]: I think anything that we do at this point, I think it makes a lot of sense for it to be not effective immediately, but go into effect at the start of the next fiscal year and be phased in in accordance with the start of future fiscal years.

458
00:43:39,761 --> 00:43:42,604
[SPEAKER_23]: If you make that in the form of the motion, I will support that tonight.

459
00:43:42,904 --> 00:43:44,806
[SPEAKER_23]: However, I have also been clear.

460
00:43:46,227 --> 00:43:47,368
[SPEAKER_23]: We are a legislative body.

461
00:43:47,688 --> 00:43:48,489
[SPEAKER_23]: We make policy.

462
00:43:48,509 --> 00:43:50,831
[SPEAKER_23]: School committee is a legislative body.

463
00:43:51,171 --> 00:43:51,952
[SPEAKER_23]: They make policy.

464
00:43:52,232 --> 00:44:01,100
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't feel comfortable as one Councilor Tseng that I know our job to be more substantial or more work than theirs because I frankly haven't seen evidence of that.

465
00:44:01,724 --> 00:44:26,133
[SPEAKER_23]: So I would also like to make the proposal in the form of a motion that school committee compensation be raised over the period of four years to be leveled to city council pay, July 1, 2024 through July 1, 2027, first two years meeting parity with that MTA contract line number, and then closing the gap in 2026 and 2027.

466
00:44:29,633 --> 00:44:30,554
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that a formal motion?

467
00:44:30,574 --> 00:44:31,394
[SPEAKER_06]: There's been a lot of conversation.

468
00:44:31,434 --> 00:44:32,014
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that a motion?

469
00:44:32,054 --> 00:44:32,835
[SPEAKER_06]: You've just made a motion.

470
00:44:33,355 --> 00:44:34,416
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a second to that motion?

471
00:44:35,877 --> 00:44:37,037
[SPEAKER_06]: So, conversation's over.

472
00:44:38,278 --> 00:44:43,101
[SPEAKER_06]: No, there's plenty of time for more motions, and we'll take them in the order that they were made, and then we'll have public participation.

473
00:44:45,963 --> 00:44:46,803
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a second on the motion?

474
00:44:46,823 --> 00:44:47,484
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll second.

475
00:44:47,504 --> 00:44:48,784
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a second from Councilor Tseng.

476
00:44:48,884 --> 00:44:50,725
[SPEAKER_06]: I will go to Councilor Callahan, then Councilor Tseng.

477
00:44:50,825 --> 00:44:57,429
[SPEAKER_15]: Whew, wow, so much to say about this.

478
00:44:59,076 --> 00:45:14,249
[SPEAKER_15]: First, I want to say that a number of years ago, the Somerville School Committee, the paraprofessionals were asking to have their salaries raised to, I think it was $25,000 a year, which I can tell you in Somerville, nor here is a living wage.

479
00:45:14,890 --> 00:45:20,755
[SPEAKER_15]: I was outraged that the school committee was like, nope, flat out.

480
00:45:22,125 --> 00:45:22,605
[SPEAKER_15]: wouldn't do it.

481
00:45:24,006 --> 00:45:39,032
[SPEAKER_15]: And one of the reasons that they gave was that they were talking to other school committees and the other school committees from other cities didn't want Somerville to raise the wage because, oh no, then it would mean that they would be under pressure to raise the wage.

482
00:45:39,393 --> 00:45:44,915
[SPEAKER_15]: And I said right there that it was my, I was incredibly disappointed.

483
00:45:45,635 --> 00:45:51,518
[SPEAKER_15]: They should be proud to be the first city to do the right thing for the paraprofessionals.

484
00:45:54,167 --> 00:45:54,327
[SPEAKER_15]: right?

485
00:45:54,888 --> 00:46:08,060
[SPEAKER_15]: So, and I want to start off by saying how much I believe that our paraprofessionals, especially, but also our teachers are underpaid for the work that they do, how incredibly important that work is.

486
00:46:10,643 --> 00:46:17,669
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I'm boggled by the types of industries that get paid twice as much as teachers, genuinely.

487
00:46:18,890 --> 00:46:19,011
[SPEAKER_15]: So,

488
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:21,651
[SPEAKER_15]: That is very important to me.

489
00:46:21,751 --> 00:46:31,178
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think, unfortunately, the only way that we are going to get the things that we care about in this city to be properly funded is to increase the total budget.

490
00:46:31,219 --> 00:46:35,182
[SPEAKER_15]: Because we're not going to steal from affordable housing stuff to pay the teachers.

491
00:46:35,202 --> 00:46:42,207
[SPEAKER_15]: We're not going to steal from the teachers to pay for putting us in line with our climate change goals.

492
00:46:42,227 --> 00:46:43,288
[SPEAKER_15]: We're not going to pay for those.

493
00:46:43,868 --> 00:46:45,750
[SPEAKER_15]: We're not going to steal from one thing to pay for another.

494
00:46:45,790 --> 00:46:48,352
[SPEAKER_15]: Our roads, everything is underfunded.

495
00:46:49,551 --> 00:46:53,712
[SPEAKER_15]: We are wildly underfunded in Medford and we have to solve that problem.

496
00:46:54,152 --> 00:47:13,979
[SPEAKER_15]: So I wanna make sure that we don't come into these detailed arguments that are like, oh, well, we can't spend this $60,000 this way because it's gonna come back and fight and compete with the other 70 things that we could spend $60,000 on, right?

497
00:47:15,039 --> 00:47:17,060
[SPEAKER_15]: So I wanna talk a little bit about

498
00:47:18,971 --> 00:47:22,934
[SPEAKER_15]: the value of having a genuine democracy, right?

499
00:47:23,734 --> 00:47:32,980
[SPEAKER_15]: I truly believe, and this is something I've spent like seven years working with experts on, studying, training people around the country in how to get a better democracy.

500
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,041
[SPEAKER_15]: It's very important to me.

501
00:47:35,081 --> 00:47:36,062
[SPEAKER_15]: I know a fair amount about it.

502
00:47:36,642 --> 00:47:44,928
[SPEAKER_15]: So when we talk about getting better representation or good representation on a city council or on a school committee, it is not about getting people who are dedicated.

503
00:47:46,283 --> 00:47:54,667
[SPEAKER_15]: It is about getting people who genuinely not only represent but vote in favor of policies that even the scales.

504
00:47:55,728 --> 00:47:58,129
[SPEAKER_15]: Our government in America at all levels

505
00:47:59,955 --> 00:48:17,261
[SPEAKER_15]: overly supports and overly serves people who are wealthy, people who own property, people who are white collar, people who have white collar jobs, people who are overly educated, people who are white.

506
00:48:18,742 --> 00:48:25,844
[SPEAKER_15]: And when we talk about having a better democracy, it isn't about getting people who are dedicated.

507
00:48:26,462 --> 00:48:31,487
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Callahan, just if you could, if you could direct your comments to me and make sure you're speaking into it.

508
00:48:31,507 --> 00:48:31,747
[SPEAKER_06]: You're fine.

509
00:48:31,767 --> 00:48:32,148
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I apologize.

510
00:48:32,168 --> 00:48:35,171
[SPEAKER_15]: New city councilor, you gotta correct me on these things.

511
00:48:35,191 --> 00:48:37,233
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you're good, and I made a lot of mistakes.

512
00:48:37,253 --> 00:48:40,856
[SPEAKER_06]: Not that it was a mistake, but I was corrected many times by Councilor Tarapelli.

513
00:48:40,896 --> 00:48:41,137
[SPEAKER_06]: Wonderful.

514
00:48:41,717 --> 00:48:42,338
[SPEAKER_15]: Great, thank you.

515
00:48:44,693 --> 00:48:58,784
[SPEAKER_15]: So having run workshops around the country for many years and having, in these workshops, to create these workshops, I studied with experts, mostly in democracy and specifically in democracy at the local level.

516
00:48:58,984 --> 00:49:02,487
[SPEAKER_15]: So city councils, town councils, more city councils than anything.

517
00:49:03,148 --> 00:49:11,754
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm just gonna, I pulled up here something that was from one of my workshops so that people understand that this is in,

518
00:49:12,535 --> 00:49:26,851
[SPEAKER_15]: like a sphere of things you can do to structurally have a better democracy and better meaning we're not only representing home owning wealthy white people in your city.

519
00:49:27,492 --> 00:49:36,376
[SPEAKER_15]: that you are properly representing the people who earn less than 50% of, you know, half the people in the city earn less than 50% of the average wage.

520
00:49:36,516 --> 00:49:39,577
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, that's the way it works.

521
00:49:39,597 --> 00:49:44,339
[SPEAKER_15]: So things that you can do to make your city be better represented.

522
00:49:45,639 --> 00:49:50,520
[SPEAKER_15]: are public financing of elections, having district awards, making sure you have vote-by-mail or early voting.

523
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:51,361
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not going to read all of these.

524
00:49:51,381 --> 00:49:52,381
[SPEAKER_15]: There's like two dozen of them.

525
00:49:53,721 --> 00:49:55,102
[SPEAKER_15]: Are your elections on paper ballots?

526
00:49:55,202 --> 00:49:57,182
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there a hand-counted audit of at least 1%?

527
00:49:57,522 --> 00:49:59,363
[SPEAKER_15]: And are your elected officials paid a living wage?

528
00:50:00,363 --> 00:50:14,027
[SPEAKER_15]: So the problem with this idea that it should be a volunteer effort is that there are lots of people, mostly people who earn less than 50%, less than the average wage in your city.

529
00:50:14,875 --> 00:50:18,037
[SPEAKER_15]: that they just can't volunteer 20 hours a week.

530
00:50:18,757 --> 00:50:32,666
[SPEAKER_15]: Neither they nor their spouse earns enough money that they are able to spend time with their families and live a decent life and pay their bills, their rent, or their groceries, or whatever it is.

531
00:50:32,686 --> 00:50:38,510
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not about them not being dedicated.

532
00:50:41,513 --> 00:50:44,175
[SPEAKER_15]: do the job if it doesn't pay.

533
00:50:44,395 --> 00:50:59,304
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm going to say, I don't think any of us on the city council, and I don't want to speak for other people, but in most cities, no one on the city council and no one on the school committee falls into those categories.

534
00:50:59,564 --> 00:51:01,145
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's why these people are underrepresented.

535
00:51:01,745 --> 00:51:03,807
[SPEAKER_15]: So I care a lot about democracy.

536
00:51:03,867 --> 00:51:06,548
[SPEAKER_15]: And I genuinely believe that the right thing to do

537
00:51:07,905 --> 00:51:10,746
[SPEAKER_15]: is to increase the pay of the school committee.

538
00:51:11,266 --> 00:51:30,031
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, that doesn't mean, that being said, right, I also believe that as a city, as an elected city councilor, it is my style to make a bunch of, to be able to pass a lot of things that materially help people.

539
00:51:30,612 --> 00:51:31,772
[SPEAKER_15]: Fix the roads.

540
00:51:33,748 --> 00:51:50,602
[SPEAKER_15]: make sure all of our positions in the school are properly, that we have people who are second language teachers, that we have after school programs for everyone, that we have these things before we do anything that is either for ourselves or cultural.

541
00:51:51,747 --> 00:51:53,108
[SPEAKER_15]: That is my style.

542
00:51:53,369 --> 00:52:05,280
[SPEAKER_15]: So I feel incredibly uncomfortable voting on this as the very first thing that comes up in my term as a city councilor, because that is not the way that I want to serve.

543
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:07,021
[SPEAKER_15]: That is not the way that I want to serve.

544
00:52:09,103 --> 00:52:16,090
[SPEAKER_15]: But I want people to understand that my viewpoint on this is not something that I come to in the last month because this

545
00:52:17,196 --> 00:52:18,477
[SPEAKER_15]: particular issue came about.

546
00:52:19,078 --> 00:52:36,996
[SPEAKER_15]: This is a viewpoint that I have held for many years, having worked with many experts on how to get your city to properly serve the underserved, which includes the paraprofessionals and the teachers and the other union workers who work here for the city or in the city.

547
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:43,382
[SPEAKER_15]: Those are incredibly important to me, and it's important to me that we serve those people first before we serve ourselves.

548
00:52:43,622 --> 00:53:05,935
[SPEAKER_15]: But it is important because the only way you can sustain a city council or a school committee that makes those right decisions is by paying a little bit more so that we can have people on those bodies who come from those backgrounds and not just people who want to

549
00:53:06,570 --> 00:53:10,872
[SPEAKER_15]: to hope to serve those people, but never actually talk to them because we all live in our own bubbles.

550
00:53:11,432 --> 00:53:12,453
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, stop there.

551
00:53:12,953 --> 00:53:14,154
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

552
00:53:14,294 --> 00:53:24,819
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Tseng, um, I think, Oh, given given the fact that Councilor Collins made a motion, I also just wanted to make a motion to

553
00:53:28,083 --> 00:53:36,191
[SPEAKER_08]: to basically do the MTA, to have the cost of living adjustment reflect the MTA raised over those years.

554
00:53:37,272 --> 00:53:37,752
[SPEAKER_08]: Over which years?

555
00:53:38,112 --> 00:53:39,534
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, do you want formal language?

556
00:53:39,854 --> 00:53:40,795
[SPEAKER_08]: Over which years, sorry?

557
00:53:41,796 --> 00:53:45,139
[SPEAKER_08]: From fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2025.

558
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:48,042
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, and then over how long?

559
00:53:50,504 --> 00:53:52,385
[SPEAKER_06]: Over those years.

560
00:53:52,805 --> 00:53:55,727
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, it would go up, but what would be the effective date?

561
00:53:55,747 --> 00:53:58,248
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, to have it go to $17,000 by July 1st, 2024, and up to $22,105.60 by July 1st, 2025.

562
00:53:58,528 --> 00:54:00,369
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so it would be the 24 and 25.

563
00:54:00,409 --> 00:54:02,990
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, it would be that one.

564
00:54:17,372 --> 00:54:17,632
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

565
00:54:17,792 --> 00:54:19,373
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, I misunderstood your question.

566
00:54:19,393 --> 00:54:22,516
[SPEAKER_08]: That's fine.

567
00:54:24,217 --> 00:54:25,598
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, this is all about balance.

568
00:54:25,778 --> 00:54:28,039
[SPEAKER_08]: This is not a proposal.

569
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:37,486
[SPEAKER_08]: This motion is not a proposal that was put out in the first place by either side of this argument, but I think it's

570
00:54:38,593 --> 00:54:43,702
[SPEAKER_08]: As I told people coming into this meeting, I think this meeting is about finding a reasonable compromise.

571
00:54:44,403 --> 00:54:47,167
[SPEAKER_08]: And I believe that motion brings us there.

572
00:54:48,509 --> 00:54:50,633
[SPEAKER_08]: And I believe very strongly that we should

573
00:54:51,621 --> 00:55:06,012
[SPEAKER_08]: take advantage of this opportunity to set a precedent and to ensure that rising tides actually lifts all boats and lifts all boats into the future and that we can hold ourselves to account with that statement as well.

574
00:55:06,032 --> 00:55:18,301
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe that this specific proposal with the MTA cost of living adjustment rates brings us most closest to that idea.

575
00:55:19,994 --> 00:55:28,140
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a motion from Councilor Tseng to increase school committee pay based on the pay scale we discussed be around 17,000 July 1 2024 and 22,000 July 1 2025.

576
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,962
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a second on that motion, second, second Councilor Leming.

577
00:55:38,361 --> 00:55:47,543
[SPEAKER_06]: there was a bunch of conversation, and I'm gonna take it in order, and I'm gonna go to Councilor Collins first, and then I'll go to Councilor Callahan, and then maybe Councilor Scarpelli, or if there are others.

578
00:55:48,324 --> 00:55:59,326
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a bunch of conversation before formal motions were made to make motions, and I wanna take the time to ensure that all motions are before us, before we go to public participation.

579
00:55:59,786 --> 00:56:04,628
[SPEAKER_06]: So just if you had said something that you would like to be a formal motion, raise your hand and I will call on you.

580
00:56:04,648 --> 00:56:06,108
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll start with Councilor Collins.

581
00:56:08,356 --> 00:56:08,596
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

582
00:56:09,457 --> 00:56:10,178
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, President Bears.

583
00:56:10,859 --> 00:56:12,441
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you for your deference, Councilor Scarpelli.

584
00:56:15,704 --> 00:56:18,568
[SPEAKER_23]: So we have two proposals before us.

585
00:56:18,808 --> 00:56:21,851
[SPEAKER_23]: And again, I say this a lot, appreciate my fellow councilors comment.

586
00:56:21,871 --> 00:56:24,675
[SPEAKER_23]: This is a sticky subject.

587
00:56:24,955 --> 00:56:26,697
[SPEAKER_23]: I appreciate the conversation that we're able to have about it.

588
00:56:28,323 --> 00:56:29,784
[SPEAKER_23]: I know I've already put forth a proposal.

589
00:56:31,624 --> 00:56:33,745
[SPEAKER_23]: Councilor Tseng has put forth another one that I also support.

590
00:56:35,386 --> 00:56:37,366
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know which of these will advance.

591
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:52,311
[SPEAKER_23]: Coming into this meeting, I know what I want to see is some increase for school committee members, and I would also like to see us create some sort of mechanism for regularly evaluating and updating and increasing

592
00:56:53,135 --> 00:56:58,819
[SPEAKER_23]: school committee compensation and that of all elected officials in a regularized way.

593
00:56:58,879 --> 00:57:15,310
[SPEAKER_23]: Maybe it's an automatic COLA increase, but I think one of the things that has made this conversation very difficult is that talking about school committee pay at all is an entirely discretionary conversation for the city council to bring up.

594
00:57:16,381 --> 00:57:22,886
[SPEAKER_23]: And so it's been 23 years since we have, since I think it's been very murky, who controls that and why and how does it get brought up?

595
00:57:22,926 --> 00:57:26,148
[SPEAKER_23]: And I think that that's just been a disservice to the conversation.

596
00:57:27,790 --> 00:57:34,034
[SPEAKER_23]: All that to say, I don't know which of, if either of the two proposals that have currently been proposed will go forward.

597
00:57:34,675 --> 00:57:44,002
[SPEAKER_23]: I'd like to propose a third towards that goal of setting some sort of creating some kind of mechanism for us to revisit this more than once every 23 years when everybody thinks of it.

598
00:57:45,743 --> 00:58:06,601
[SPEAKER_23]: The motion would be for this council to refer this paper to the governance committee for consideration during charter review with the goal of creating a mechanism within the updated city charter to trigger automatic COLA increases and or compensation review for all elected positions at regular interviews.

599
00:58:07,482 --> 00:58:10,125
[SPEAKER_23]: And I can forward that language to you, Mr. Clerk, if you like.

600
00:58:12,403 --> 00:58:27,756
[SPEAKER_23]: And just to reiterate, the goal here is to come out of this with some sort of mechanism for looking at elected compensation so that it doesn't fall by the wayside for 23 years, because I think that that is one of the ingredients in this scenario when we haven't talked about it in a couple decades.

601
00:58:27,796 --> 00:58:35,723
[SPEAKER_23]: And so when we do, one of the things we contemplate is a triple digit percentage increase because it's just been so long since we talked about it.

602
00:58:37,998 --> 00:58:38,879
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, that's my motion.

603
00:58:39,039 --> 00:58:51,106
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of Councilor Collins to refer a paper to the Governance Committee for consideration during charter review, and I'll paraphrase, I think it's to create a mechanism for review of compensation of elected officials.

604
00:58:51,826 --> 00:58:55,488
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll get the specific language and we'll read back all language before final motions and votes.

605
00:58:56,068 --> 00:58:57,289
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a second on that motion?

606
00:58:57,309 --> 00:58:57,549
[SPEAKER_06]: Second.

607
00:58:58,290 --> 00:58:59,310
[SPEAKER_06]: Second, Councilor Tseng.

608
00:59:00,691 --> 00:59:02,892
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll go to Councilor Callahan and then Councilor Scarpelli.

609
00:59:02,912 --> 00:59:03,553
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Callahan.

610
00:59:05,302 --> 00:59:09,883
[SPEAKER_15]: I was only going to ask for the motions to be read more slowly before we vote.

611
00:59:10,223 --> 00:59:15,365
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we're going to have to go back and get specific numeric and legal language when they're to be finally considered.

612
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:17,265
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think we can put the substance on the table.

613
00:59:17,705 --> 00:59:21,606
[SPEAKER_06]: We can do the detail work after we've had more discussion and participation.

614
00:59:22,367 --> 00:59:23,547
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli, your motions?

615
00:59:23,607 --> 00:59:27,368
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, first, I think the point of information is for clarity purposes, Council President.

616
00:59:28,288 --> 00:59:30,869
[SPEAKER_17]: We're not, as we move forward, we're not tying in

617
00:59:31,710 --> 00:59:35,133
[SPEAKER_17]: the increase if this passes with the school committee, correct?

618
00:59:35,193 --> 00:59:41,138
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not, it's not, it wouldn't be voted by the school committee because in essence that would be a conflict of interest, correct?

619
00:59:41,478 --> 00:59:51,466
[SPEAKER_17]: It would be something that if we do, if we do vote yes to this, that the increase would have to come from the council every year after that or put into place now.

620
00:59:52,758 --> 01:00:01,103
[SPEAKER_17]: at that time, because I think it's a conflict of interest if we're having the school committee voting on something that's going to be on the same line as the teacher's contract.

621
01:00:01,143 --> 01:00:02,184
[SPEAKER_17]: That's a confusion.

622
01:00:02,304 --> 01:00:03,244
[SPEAKER_17]: That's all I want to clarify.

623
01:00:03,264 --> 01:00:05,766
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no, and that's where we're going to get the specific language.

624
01:00:05,846 --> 01:00:07,166
[SPEAKER_06]: I do not care.

625
01:00:07,246 --> 01:00:09,648
[SPEAKER_06]: What, pursuant to the legal opinion,

626
01:00:10,814 --> 01:00:13,156
[SPEAKER_06]: The school committee cannot vote to adjust its compensation.

627
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:15,457
[SPEAKER_06]: Only the council can vote to adjust its compensation.

628
01:00:15,498 --> 01:00:20,982
[SPEAKER_06]: There are other laws governing the council, like we could not vote our own compensation in the term in which we're elected.

629
01:00:21,022 --> 01:00:23,083
[SPEAKER_06]: There's different laws that govern our compensation.

630
01:00:23,584 --> 01:00:26,426
[SPEAKER_06]: This would not tie it into the contract.

631
01:00:26,886 --> 01:00:29,488
[SPEAKER_06]: There would be specific numbers effective on specific dates.

632
01:00:30,188 --> 01:00:34,572
[SPEAKER_06]: And once those were in effect, let's say that the proposal for

633
01:00:35,532 --> 01:00:44,098
[SPEAKER_06]: an increase in 2024 and 2025, there would have to be a new vote after 2025 from the council pursuant to this general law.

634
01:00:44,178 --> 01:00:44,959
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for that, Claire.

635
01:00:44,999 --> 01:00:45,760
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, absolutely.

636
01:00:46,860 --> 01:00:53,085
[SPEAKER_17]: My motion would be that the City Council lower their rate of pay

637
01:00:54,566 --> 01:00:55,266
[SPEAKER_17]: the school board.

638
01:00:55,286 --> 01:01:05,289
[SPEAKER_17]: To uh, equitable rate for the school committee and then follow Council sayings or, uh, process of compensation moving forward.

639
01:01:05,350 --> 01:01:05,890
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that.

640
01:01:06,970 --> 01:01:07,390
[SPEAKER_17]: With the.

641
01:01:08,430 --> 01:01:08,971
[SPEAKER_17]: With the, uh.

642
01:01:10,751 --> 01:01:11,571
[SPEAKER_17]: The fiscal

643
01:01:21,391 --> 01:01:25,694
[SPEAKER_17]: our concerns and issues from all sides to be on level playing field.

644
01:01:26,115 --> 01:01:28,597
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's not a political ploy.

645
01:01:28,697 --> 01:01:34,501
[SPEAKER_17]: This is something that I feel strongly about, that if this is a wrong and we wanna make it right, let's make it right.

646
01:01:35,142 --> 01:01:35,943
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

647
01:01:36,523 --> 01:01:37,604
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

648
01:01:37,844 --> 01:01:38,625
[SPEAKER_06]: Give me one second.

649
01:01:45,830 --> 01:01:47,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me, I think it's a motion.

650
01:01:48,686 --> 01:02:03,752
[SPEAKER_06]: for the council to lower its own rate of pay to the school committee rate and then increase that rate of pay based on the motion by Councilor Tseng which is based on the percentage increase for the MTA contract from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 25.

651
01:02:04,272 --> 01:02:04,612
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

652
01:02:05,012 --> 01:02:05,292
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

653
01:02:06,253 --> 01:02:07,253
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a second on that motion?

654
01:02:13,195 --> 01:02:14,936
[SPEAKER_18]: It's gonna be a difficult two years, isn't it everybody?

655
01:02:19,065 --> 01:02:23,629
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, can I ask for some clarification on that?

656
01:02:24,891 --> 01:02:26,152
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, Councilor Lazzaro, what's the question?

657
01:02:26,592 --> 01:02:28,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you clarify the dollar amounts?

658
01:02:28,694 --> 01:02:31,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Could you repeat that, sorry?

659
01:02:32,158 --> 01:02:34,119
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you clarify the dollar amounts that that would be?

660
01:02:34,139 --> 01:02:39,464
[SPEAKER_15]: Can you clarify the dollar amounts?

661
01:02:40,666 --> 01:02:42,387
[SPEAKER_06]: For Councilor Scarpelli's resolution?

662
01:02:42,628 --> 01:02:42,808
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

663
01:02:44,461 --> 01:02:49,565
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, best that I can tell it would be blended rate that it's equitable for both parties.

664
01:02:49,725 --> 01:02:56,491
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be to go down to 12,000 and then go up to no, no.

665
01:02:56,631 --> 01:02:58,612
[SPEAKER_06]: It was 17 and then to 22.

666
01:02:58,932 --> 01:03:08,960
[SPEAKER_17]: No, it would be taking our salaries, pulling together an all-stop level playing field, roughly 20,000, whatever the math comes up and then go up and then go up with what the process would be.

667
01:03:09,281 --> 01:03:09,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

668
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:18,056
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounds like it would be that we would all be around 20,000 and then it would go up at least to the 22,000 over the next two years.

669
01:03:19,337 --> 01:03:20,398
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be happy to second this.

670
01:03:20,458 --> 01:03:26,043
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to see the, I think, I just think I would want to see some clarity on the numbers a little bit more.

671
01:03:28,143 --> 01:03:29,204
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I couldn't hear that.

672
01:03:29,224 --> 01:03:29,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

673
01:03:29,684 --> 01:03:31,925
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure why my, my computer's being fussy.

674
01:03:32,025 --> 01:03:32,705
[SPEAKER_03]: I would be happy.

675
01:03:32,725 --> 01:03:34,246
[SPEAKER_03]: I would be happy to second this.

676
01:03:34,626 --> 01:03:37,428
[SPEAKER_03]: I would just want the numbers to be a little bit more clear.

677
01:03:37,628 --> 01:03:46,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, would we take all of the dollar amounts of the city council salaries and the dollar amounts of the school committee salaries, even them all out for this year.

678
01:03:47,112 --> 01:03:52,335
[SPEAKER_03]: And then for next year and the year after and like, and then have them all be the same, but raise them up to the level of.

679
01:03:53,797 --> 01:04:15,835
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever it would land at with uh Councilor sang's final level and then we everybody would be even yeah i mean that sounds like the idea given i do not know that we can legally do that and even if we were to do that the money would not be in the schools because they're two different budgets right okay so this is my this is my hesitation i really like the idea though

680
01:04:19,588 --> 01:04:20,088
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, buddy.

681
01:04:24,011 --> 01:04:31,016
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm more concerned that I don't know that we can legally take that vote, and I don't have the legal authority on it.

682
01:04:31,096 --> 01:04:31,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Where's Adam?

683
01:04:32,337 --> 01:04:33,938
[SPEAKER_06]: He appears from his file cabinet.

684
01:04:37,581 --> 01:04:39,703
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so there are four motions on the floor.

685
01:04:39,763 --> 01:04:40,723
[SPEAKER_06]: They've all been seconded.

686
01:04:40,763 --> 01:04:45,026
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a motion from Councilor Collins to use the MTA pay scale

687
01:04:47,025 --> 01:05:06,268
[SPEAKER_06]: the COLAs over the last 25 fiscal years to increase school committee pay on July 1, 2024 and July 1, 2025, and then to also increase to equal pay to the current council salary July 1, 2026 and July 1, 2027, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

688
01:05:06,288 --> 01:05:14,190
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a motion by Councilor Tseng to increase using the COLAs of the MTA contracts on July 1, 2024 and July 1, 2025,

689
01:05:17,353 --> 01:05:27,600
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a motion from Councilor Collins to refer a paper to the Governance Committee for consideration during charter review to create a mechanism for regular automatic review and adjustment of the compensation of all elected officials.

690
01:05:28,220 --> 01:05:36,066
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's a motion from Councilor Scarpelli for the council to lower its own rate of pay to the school committee to lower to even out the rate of pay

691
01:05:37,126 --> 01:05:48,611
[SPEAKER_06]: between the council and the school committee take the total amount divided by the number of people serving and then to increase it based on the COLA schedule of the MTA contracts from fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2025.

692
01:05:48,711 --> 01:05:51,232
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe those are the four motions on the floor.

693
01:05:52,792 --> 01:05:58,516
[SPEAKER_06]: at this time, unless there are further comments by members of the Council, I'll open the floor to public participation.

694
01:05:59,257 --> 01:06:06,281
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, as we did last time, please, you can come up to the podium, make a line here, you can raise your hand on Zoom.

695
01:06:07,282 --> 01:06:11,205
[SPEAKER_06]: I would ask that everyone please try to respect a three-minute time frame so that we can hear from everybody.

696
01:06:13,286 --> 01:06:17,728
[SPEAKER_06]: And please keep your comments directed to the topic at hand and not make them personal.

697
01:06:17,748 --> 01:06:18,088
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

698
01:06:18,108 --> 01:06:19,729
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, can you hear me?

699
01:06:19,849 --> 01:06:20,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we can hear you.

700
01:06:20,429 --> 01:06:21,710
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address for the record, please.

701
01:06:21,930 --> 01:06:32,994
[SPEAKER_14]: Eleanor Brady O'Leary, 30 Norwich Circle, Secretary of the MTA, Teacher's Association, and a teacher in this school district for 33 years.

702
01:06:33,935 --> 01:06:39,677
[SPEAKER_14]: What I want to say is what I heard during negotiations over and over and over.

703
01:06:40,917 --> 01:06:41,458
[SPEAKER_14]: And mind you,

704
01:06:42,620 --> 01:06:45,482
[SPEAKER_14]: not when one single school committee member was sitting there.

705
01:06:47,203 --> 01:06:47,863
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry.

706
01:06:48,303 --> 01:06:53,646
[SPEAKER_14]: You cannot have that cola raised because we need to be fiscally responsible.

707
01:06:54,487 --> 01:07:00,450
[SPEAKER_14]: If we heard it once, we heard it 100 times, no matter what we asked for.

708
01:07:01,351 --> 01:07:11,397
[SPEAKER_14]: And I guess when I sit here and listen tonight for you to tell me that you are going to use our contract, full-time teachers,

709
01:07:12,202 --> 01:07:15,224
[SPEAKER_14]: to pay part-time school committee members.

710
01:07:15,824 --> 01:07:17,325
[SPEAKER_14]: It is unheard of.

711
01:07:18,566 --> 01:07:19,366
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm appalled.

712
01:07:21,067 --> 01:07:23,909
[SPEAKER_14]: I stayed in this district for 33 years.

713
01:07:24,309 --> 01:07:25,190
[SPEAKER_14]: I was raised here.

714
01:07:25,470 --> 01:07:26,530
[SPEAKER_14]: I went to school here.

715
01:07:26,891 --> 01:07:29,072
[SPEAKER_14]: My father was a teacher here for 35 years.

716
01:07:29,332 --> 01:07:29,652
[SPEAKER_14]: Why?

717
01:07:29,672 --> 01:07:31,954
[SPEAKER_14]: Because we love this district.

718
01:07:32,830 --> 01:07:35,891
[SPEAKER_14]: But when I hear this stuff, it makes my blood boil.

719
01:07:36,591 --> 01:07:38,432
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I am retiring in June.

720
01:07:39,192 --> 01:07:45,394
[SPEAKER_14]: And you know something, we fought and we fought and we fought for a contract last, the past, how many years?

721
01:07:46,214 --> 01:07:53,996
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm gonna tell you, a school committee member, one, showed up at one negotiation meeting.

722
01:07:55,076 --> 01:08:00,178
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm gonna tell you, I was at a negotiation meeting, I don't know, I'm surprised I'm not divorced.

723
01:08:01,087 --> 01:08:05,029
[SPEAKER_14]: But I would say five times a week, at least.

724
01:08:06,050 --> 01:08:08,711
[SPEAKER_14]: For nothing, no stipend.

725
01:08:09,612 --> 01:08:10,572
[SPEAKER_14]: Why were we on that?

726
01:08:10,872 --> 01:08:13,134
[SPEAKER_14]: We were on that to fight for what we believed in.

727
01:08:14,014 --> 01:08:18,297
[SPEAKER_14]: Where are the school committee members tonight fighting for what they want?

728
01:08:18,597 --> 01:08:21,258
[SPEAKER_14]: Why aren't they out there picketing like we did?

729
01:08:22,079 --> 01:08:26,501
[SPEAKER_14]: Why aren't they offered the little small minute that we were offered?

730
01:08:26,921 --> 01:08:29,683
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, I have a really hard time with it.

731
01:08:30,891 --> 01:08:37,055
[SPEAKER_14]: And the other thing that I was listening as we went along, do they deserve a raise?

732
01:08:37,415 --> 01:08:37,996
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure they do.

733
01:08:38,556 --> 01:08:47,822
[SPEAKER_14]: But when I read in Jenny Graham's email tonight, that a teacher's raise over the course of time is 256%, it took me 33 years to go from here to here.

734
01:08:47,982 --> 01:08:48,103
[SPEAKER_14]: And,

735
01:08:55,646 --> 01:08:57,928
[SPEAKER_14]: I had to pay for those increments.

736
01:08:58,549 --> 01:09:03,693
[SPEAKER_14]: So when I went from a bachelor's to a bachelor's 15, I had to pay for it.

737
01:09:04,033 --> 01:09:10,199
[SPEAKER_14]: When I went from a master's to a master's 15 or 45, I had to pay for a school.

738
01:09:10,699 --> 01:09:16,904
[SPEAKER_14]: So I put out, I don't know, $20,000 to get what?

739
01:09:17,285 --> 01:09:18,226
[SPEAKER_14]: $1,000 raise each time?

740
01:09:19,106 --> 01:09:22,629
[SPEAKER_14]: So when you sit there and say, they get all this money,

741
01:09:23,683 --> 01:09:24,944
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't get all this money.

742
01:09:25,244 --> 01:09:28,225
[SPEAKER_14]: We have to pay to get this money.

743
01:09:28,966 --> 01:09:33,788
[SPEAKER_14]: And then when they turn to us and say, I'm sorry, we don't have the money to give you 3%.

744
01:09:35,229 --> 01:09:36,029
[SPEAKER_14]: You're not getting it.

745
01:09:36,490 --> 01:09:38,811
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll give you, I think they started at zero.

746
01:09:39,691 --> 01:09:39,791
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, 1.5.

747
01:09:40,652 --> 01:09:41,852
[SPEAKER_14]: They did start at 1.5.

748
01:09:42,352 --> 01:09:45,034
[SPEAKER_14]: And then they were very upset that we came back and said, no.

749
01:09:47,075 --> 01:09:48,296
[SPEAKER_14]: We were off at pencils.

750
01:09:49,076 --> 01:09:50,717
[SPEAKER_14]: We thought that was pretty crazy.

751
01:09:51,792 --> 01:09:54,673
[SPEAKER_14]: The things that they think I don't understand.

752
01:09:55,133 --> 01:10:00,694
[SPEAKER_14]: I do have a part-time job, along with, I'm gonna say 70% of the teachers.

753
01:10:01,314 --> 01:10:05,055
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you think I make $30,000 in my part-time job?

754
01:10:05,755 --> 01:10:06,795
[SPEAKER_14]: No, of course I don't.

755
01:10:07,255 --> 01:10:08,616
[SPEAKER_14]: Why do I have a part-time job?

756
01:10:08,636 --> 01:10:10,076
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I'm a school teacher.

757
01:10:11,836 --> 01:10:13,337
[SPEAKER_14]: And I have two children in college.

758
01:10:13,697 --> 01:10:15,237
[SPEAKER_14]: And I own a home here in Medford.

759
01:10:15,737 --> 01:10:19,378
[SPEAKER_14]: So yes, people, my husband and I don't make a lot of money.

760
01:10:21,434 --> 01:10:22,834
[SPEAKER_14]: So I fight for what we're going to get.

761
01:10:23,214 --> 01:10:29,695
[SPEAKER_14]: And I haven't seen anyone on that school committee fighting for their race like we had to fight for us.

762
01:10:30,456 --> 01:10:34,736
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry I get emotional because this is my home.

763
01:10:35,816 --> 01:10:38,097
[SPEAKER_14]: This is where I work, where I live, everything.

764
01:10:38,597 --> 01:10:41,597
[SPEAKER_14]: And I just see it and it's driving me crazy.

765
01:10:42,558 --> 01:10:42,918
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

766
01:10:45,178 --> 01:10:48,599
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to go to Zoom next.

767
01:10:48,699 --> 01:10:50,459
[SPEAKER_06]: Patricia Cherry on Zoom.

768
01:10:52,489 --> 01:10:53,190
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll unmute you.

769
01:10:53,390 --> 01:10:55,371
[SPEAKER_06]: If you could give name and address for the record, please.

770
01:11:01,215 --> 01:11:02,256
[SPEAKER_06]: Patricia, are you there?

771
01:11:02,276 --> 01:11:10,742
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, I'll go to Tracy on Zoom.

772
01:11:13,444 --> 01:11:15,766
[SPEAKER_06]: Tracy, if you could give your name and address for the record, please.

773
01:11:16,566 --> 01:11:16,786
[SPEAKER_24]: Yep.

774
01:11:17,127 --> 01:11:18,668
[SPEAKER_24]: My name is Tracy Clements.

775
01:11:18,828 --> 01:11:20,409
[SPEAKER_24]: I live at 28 Alfred Street.

776
01:11:21,421 --> 01:11:24,962
[SPEAKER_24]: And I don't attend a lot of these meetings, but I've been paying a lot more attention.

777
01:11:26,443 --> 01:11:29,924
[SPEAKER_24]: And I, like everyone else, I believe people do deserve a raise.

778
01:11:30,825 --> 01:11:37,507
[SPEAKER_24]: But when you read Jenny Graham's email, and she states that you're at risk of losing 30 staff when you already don't have enough.

779
01:11:38,087 --> 01:11:39,788
[SPEAKER_24]: You've got buildings in disrepair.

780
01:11:39,868 --> 01:11:41,589
[SPEAKER_24]: People are waiting down halls in the high school.

781
01:11:41,669 --> 01:11:43,009
[SPEAKER_24]: There's multi classrooms.

782
01:11:43,710 --> 01:11:49,332
[SPEAKER_24]: The school my child goes to is severely understaffed with custodians, with aides, with teachers.

783
01:11:50,914 --> 01:12:09,718
[SPEAKER_24]: And I just feel like you need to think about what you're doing before and understand and look at this budget before you start voting on raising your rate for a job that you wanted to run for, you got elected for, I understand you want to make money.

784
01:12:10,638 --> 01:12:17,940
[SPEAKER_24]: But reading Jenny Graham's email was really disheartening to see some of that stuff and to stand up there and say, you're going to make

785
01:12:18,968 --> 01:12:38,414
[SPEAKER_24]: What just and I don't I don't remember what the pay increases for years three and four, but if it's It sounds like it's going to be an enormous jump and if you already don't have the money now And there's really no plan in place to get any more money from the city because you're not doing props You're not putting anything in place on on the ballots to get more money.

786
01:12:38,614 --> 01:12:45,536
[SPEAKER_24]: So I guess it's just really disheartening as a parent to see how hard these teachers work day in and day out

787
01:12:46,892 --> 01:12:54,259
[SPEAKER_24]: And then to see like the previous speaker just said not one school committee person like fighting for this They're just assuming they're going to get it.

788
01:12:54,419 --> 01:13:09,072
[SPEAKER_24]: So it's just And maybe some of them don't even want it so I can't even speak for all of them It's just really disheartening as just a citizen of medford to see how bad the schools are but yet, you know reaping the benefits of Money, that's not even there

789
01:13:14,158 --> 01:13:14,938
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Tracy.

790
01:13:15,178 --> 01:13:17,279
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to go back to the podium.

791
01:13:17,459 --> 01:13:18,760
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address for the record, please.

792
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:22,021
[SPEAKER_12]: My name is Anthony Guillen.

793
01:13:22,121 --> 01:13:27,063
[SPEAKER_12]: I live at 45 Elm Hill Avenue in Leamington, Massachusetts, and I am the president of the Med Fatiges Association.

794
01:13:29,673 --> 01:13:41,881
[SPEAKER_12]: like to start today, while it has been unpopular to just read out what other spoke of many snake in the surrounding towns, as was mentioned by Councilor Scott Peli Malden $12,000 a year, some level $15,000 a year.

795
01:13:46,244 --> 01:13:51,689
[SPEAKER_12]: Everett $12,500 a year, Belmont is unpaid, and Arlington is $3,500.

796
01:13:52,049 --> 01:14:03,460
[SPEAKER_12]: And I've heard arguments that a higher stipend or a higher yearly salary for a school committee member will attract lower income people.

797
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:08,844
[SPEAKER_12]: And the hard truth of it is, the financial barrier is not once you get elected.

798
01:14:09,693 --> 01:14:13,396
[SPEAKER_12]: I've worked in local politics in many different levels, the financial barrier is running.

799
01:14:14,177 --> 01:14:16,119
[SPEAKER_12]: So there is a barrier already in place.

800
01:14:16,159 --> 01:14:25,147
[SPEAKER_12]: So we cannot pretend that an increase in the stipend is going to attract lower income candidates because they don't have the money to start with.

801
01:14:25,367 --> 01:14:27,909
[SPEAKER_12]: This is the matter of putting a down payment on a house argument.

802
01:14:28,329 --> 01:14:30,752
[SPEAKER_12]: If you don't have the money for the down payment, you can't afford the mortgage.

803
01:14:31,913 --> 01:14:34,315
[SPEAKER_12]: So I find it to be a disingenuous argument.

804
01:14:37,298 --> 01:14:52,869
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd also like to address again, as we got the email from school Councilor Graham on this hypothetical teacher who jumped from $30,000 in FY 2000 to $106,000 in FY 24.

805
01:14:53,750 --> 01:14:59,875
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd like to point out that to jump from a bachelor's to a master's is $7,500 per semester.

806
01:15:00,155 --> 01:15:05,459
[SPEAKER_12]: If you go to a program like I did at UMass Boston, which is one of the cheaper programs you can get your teaching certificate at,

807
01:15:07,253 --> 01:15:12,721
[SPEAKER_12]: So you're looking at an average of four semesters, five semesters, depending on what you can do.

808
01:15:12,741 --> 01:15:19,631
[SPEAKER_12]: The plus 45 attached to that master's comes with programs you have to pay for out of pocket.

809
01:15:20,753 --> 01:15:20,893
[SPEAKER_12]: So.

810
01:15:22,093 --> 01:15:24,775
[SPEAKER_12]: you're already spending money to get these changes.

811
01:15:25,855 --> 01:15:28,657
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, this comparison is not culpable.

812
01:15:29,537 --> 01:15:32,739
[SPEAKER_12]: As an order to gain this increase, the teacher has to work the job for 24 years.

813
01:15:32,799 --> 01:15:39,463
[SPEAKER_12]: This doesn't attach the money to the position, it attaches it to the teacher and it's there to keep them there, right?

814
01:15:39,483 --> 01:15:49,509
[SPEAKER_12]: So we cannot compare a teacher who has worked for 24 years to a position that may rotate in and out because the next teacher who takes over for that teacher isn't getting that pay, that pay goes down.

815
01:15:52,918 --> 01:16:09,904
[SPEAKER_12]: I also wanna address that when we were here last time speaking on this budget, many paraprofessionals came to speak, and after the meeting, they were pulled in for disciplinary hearings on what they said at this council.

816
01:16:11,124 --> 01:16:20,788
[SPEAKER_12]: Members of the school committee felt it was their duty to tell an educational professional to take their beating in silence, and I would like to say this,

817
01:16:22,191 --> 01:16:39,741
[SPEAKER_12]: as the president of the union, as a teacher, and as a parent of a child who is in a special education program, that anyone who asks for silence from the workers who help our students is not abdicating for the students, they're abdicating for the status quo.

818
01:16:40,642 --> 01:16:41,222
[SPEAKER_12]: Nothing else.

819
01:16:42,203 --> 01:16:45,304
[SPEAKER_17]: Point of information, point of information, Councilor Villescaz.

820
01:16:46,185 --> 01:16:46,885
[SPEAKER_17]: I hate to interrupt,

821
01:16:48,433 --> 01:16:50,654
[SPEAKER_17]: If this is true, have anybody filed?

822
01:16:50,674 --> 01:16:52,215
[SPEAKER_17]: Because this is serious.

823
01:16:52,235 --> 01:16:53,316
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a paraprofessional.

824
01:16:53,416 --> 01:16:55,737
[SPEAKER_12]: I am not privy to who has filed.

825
01:16:55,777 --> 01:16:57,358
[SPEAKER_12]: That is a different union.

826
01:16:57,418 --> 01:17:00,660
[SPEAKER_17]: I was spoken to by the head of the paraprofessionals union.

827
01:17:01,021 --> 01:17:03,362
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, this is one of the issues that I heard myself, so thank you.

828
01:17:03,742 --> 01:17:03,902
[SPEAKER_12]: Good.

829
01:17:03,922 --> 01:17:07,865
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd like to end speaking tonight reiterating what I stated in September.

830
01:17:07,885 --> 01:17:14,489
[SPEAKER_12]: Our football coaches make $3,000 to $6,000 less a year than our neighboring school districts.

831
01:17:15,049 --> 01:17:16,570
[SPEAKER_12]: Our basketball and hockey coaches $2,000 to $3,000 less

832
01:17:18,806 --> 01:17:26,092
[SPEAKER_12]: Our senior class advisors are given $1,000 annually to plan the prom, to plan graduation, to plan the gifts.

833
01:17:27,754 --> 01:17:31,457
[SPEAKER_12]: They start at a freshman level at $600 to plan the events.

834
01:17:32,118 --> 01:17:39,284
[SPEAKER_12]: We have several people who put on dances and put on events for the school that are paid almost nothing or nothing.

835
01:17:40,425 --> 01:17:43,548
[SPEAKER_12]: And the money that's being talked about today can make a difference there.

836
01:17:44,830 --> 01:17:49,232
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not going to overstate how much money it is, but it can make a difference to the stipends.

837
01:17:49,932 --> 01:17:55,794
[SPEAKER_12]: And to be honest, the people who have been running our sports programs have been waiting for a raise just as long as school committee.

838
01:17:55,814 --> 01:17:58,555
[SPEAKER_12]: There has not been movement on that for a long time.

839
01:17:58,755 --> 01:18:01,276
[SPEAKER_12]: And I will acknowledge we are in negotiations currently on that.

840
01:18:01,977 --> 01:18:05,938
[SPEAKER_12]: But again, that has to move at our pace, whereas this seems to be moving much faster.

841
01:18:05,958 --> 01:18:08,159
[SPEAKER_12]: So I thank you for your time.

842
01:18:08,179 --> 01:18:10,760
[SPEAKER_12]: I thank you for the opportunity to speak.

843
01:18:12,881 --> 01:18:15,383
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to go to Patricia Cherry on Zoom.

844
01:18:15,743 --> 01:18:16,764
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd also like to back up for it.

845
01:18:16,784 --> 01:18:17,985
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address for the record, please.

846
01:18:19,466 --> 01:18:21,788
[SPEAKER_25]: Patricia Cherry, 20 Wellesley Street, Method Mass.

847
01:18:23,390 --> 01:18:24,030
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks, Patricia.

848
01:18:24,050 --> 01:18:25,391
[SPEAKER_25]: Go ahead.

849
01:18:25,411 --> 01:18:28,254
[SPEAKER_25]: I first want to start with a quick question just to clarify something.

850
01:18:28,554 --> 01:18:40,784
[SPEAKER_25]: This money that we're talking about that we're going to be using to give the raise to the school committee, are those funds available to be used for anything other than that?

851
01:18:42,975 --> 01:18:45,217
[SPEAKER_25]: could they be used for for teachers?

852
01:18:46,358 --> 01:18:46,678
[SPEAKER_25]: pay?

853
01:18:46,758 --> 01:18:49,200
[SPEAKER_25]: Could it be used for paraprofessionals pay?

854
01:18:49,300 --> 01:18:50,581
[SPEAKER_25]: Or is this a different fund?

855
01:18:52,022 --> 01:18:54,924
[SPEAKER_06]: Under the proposals that have been proposed going to an effect?

856
01:18:54,964 --> 01:18:57,126
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, July 1 2024.

857
01:18:57,766 --> 01:19:00,628
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's it's money that is appropriated by the city budget.

858
01:19:00,748 --> 01:19:03,230
[SPEAKER_06]: So it could go to any rated amount.

859
01:19:04,311 --> 01:19:12,537
[SPEAKER_25]: It could Okay, because I just thought last time we were talking about it, that it was being said that could only be used for raises for the school committee.

860
01:19:13,237 --> 01:19:13,978
[SPEAKER_25]: She's talking about raises.

861
01:19:14,198 --> 01:19:21,063
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, again, Patricia, just I have a point of clarification that we do not negotiate contracts.

862
01:19:21,083 --> 01:19:26,608
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't set the appropriation of any item school budget as a city council, except for this one item.

863
01:19:26,648 --> 01:19:28,710
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the only item that is set by the city council.

864
01:19:28,730 --> 01:19:30,011
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

865
01:19:30,091 --> 01:19:30,891
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

866
01:19:30,991 --> 01:19:35,255
[SPEAKER_25]: And so for me, I mean, I do think the school committee needs a raise.

867
01:19:36,075 --> 01:19:37,637
[SPEAKER_25]: I do think that they're underpaid.

868
01:19:39,618 --> 01:19:42,741
[SPEAKER_25]: The amount that you guys are talking about is a stretch.

869
01:19:43,847 --> 01:19:47,770
[SPEAKER_25]: Um, I also think this comes at a really bad time.

870
01:19:47,830 --> 01:19:53,813
[SPEAKER_25]: Like we're just starting off the year and you guys are like paying for a job that we haven't even seen anybody do yet.

871
01:19:54,934 --> 01:19:57,736
[SPEAKER_25]: So it just, it's kind of disheartening in that.

872
01:19:57,956 --> 01:20:01,598
[SPEAKER_25]: But again, with that being said, I do think the school committee does need a raise.

873
01:20:01,878 --> 01:20:07,222
[SPEAKER_25]: I just think that the amount that you're looking at is just right now, not something that we can afford.

874
01:20:07,242 --> 01:20:11,204
[SPEAKER_25]: Um, to the schools are underfunded, understaffed.

875
01:20:12,225 --> 01:20:12,345
[SPEAKER_25]: Um,

876
01:20:13,638 --> 01:20:16,821
[SPEAKER_25]: it could be used in better ways, I think anyways.

877
01:20:17,902 --> 01:20:19,743
[SPEAKER_25]: But I did want to touch on one other thing.

878
01:20:19,763 --> 01:20:32,314
[SPEAKER_25]: I think it was the gentleman who just stood up and it was said earlier about some comments that were made at the last meeting by paraprofessionals that were standing up and talking about how difficult their jobs are.

879
01:20:33,214 --> 01:20:34,856
[SPEAKER_25]: And we all do know they are difficult.

880
01:20:36,278 --> 01:20:43,962
[SPEAKER_25]: But what I thought was a little bit much is the way that they were coming up and speaking of the children that they take care of.

881
01:20:44,583 --> 01:20:44,823
[SPEAKER_25]: It was

882
01:20:45,495 --> 01:20:55,262
[SPEAKER_25]: kind of degrading as a mother of a child with special needs, it made it seem like all kids, because they kept saying high needs, high needs, high need classrooms, high need classrooms, that's all they were talking about.

883
01:20:55,983 --> 01:21:01,687
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, these kids were fighting and spitting and kicking it made it seem like every single kid in the classroom was doing that.

884
01:21:02,047 --> 01:21:04,028
[SPEAKER_25]: So when I walked away from that, yeah, I was upset.

885
01:21:04,068 --> 01:21:10,153
[SPEAKER_25]: And I was one who complained, because you know what, you already put it and my kids already stigmatized as it is, you just put some more on them.

886
01:21:11,010 --> 01:21:16,033
[SPEAKER_25]: So I wanna make that point to the guy who just stood up too, that that wasn't fair.

887
01:21:17,294 --> 01:21:26,379
[SPEAKER_25]: Again, our kids are already fighting to stay afloat, getting up there and making it seem like they're the only ones that are giving teachers and paraprofessionals a problem was a joke.

888
01:21:26,759 --> 01:21:30,341
[SPEAKER_25]: Because I can tell you, they're not the ones out there stabbing kids in bathrooms.

889
01:21:30,621 --> 01:21:32,562
[SPEAKER_25]: They're not the ones out there punching each other.

890
01:21:32,882 --> 01:21:34,363
[SPEAKER_25]: They're not the ones out there having fights.

891
01:21:34,763 --> 01:21:37,285
[SPEAKER_25]: So next time you should just do it as an overall and say,

892
01:21:37,925 --> 01:21:39,166
[SPEAKER_25]: All kids are an issue.

893
01:21:39,527 --> 01:21:45,052
[SPEAKER_25]: We have a high job because all kids can be disciplined problems, not just high needs.

894
01:21:45,512 --> 01:21:47,294
[SPEAKER_25]: That's just a little food for thought for next time.

895
01:21:48,075 --> 01:21:50,277
[SPEAKER_25]: But yeah, so that's all I really have to say.

896
01:21:50,977 --> 01:21:52,359
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you guys for the work you do.

897
01:21:53,860 --> 01:21:54,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Patricia.

898
01:21:56,690 --> 01:21:58,611
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm seeing no more hands raised on Zoom.

899
01:21:59,052 --> 01:22:00,553
[SPEAKER_06]: I will go to the podium.

900
01:22:01,053 --> 01:22:02,634
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address for the record, please.

901
01:22:03,235 --> 01:22:08,118
[SPEAKER_11]: Walter Buckley, president of Local 1032 Method Firefighters 340 Salmon Street.

902
01:22:09,039 --> 01:22:11,841
[SPEAKER_11]: I spoke in December at the meeting when it was first raised.

903
01:22:12,381 --> 01:22:22,689
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to reiterate that the teachers and the fire department and the DPW and some of those small unions in this city have just negotiated their contracts.

904
01:22:22,729 --> 01:22:25,431
[SPEAKER_11]: The police are currently out of a contract for over a year.

905
01:22:26,590 --> 01:22:28,232
[SPEAKER_11]: For around 3%, say.

906
01:22:29,573 --> 01:22:34,338
[SPEAKER_11]: So this raise right here would take us 49 years to get to 148%.

907
01:22:34,378 --> 01:22:37,101
[SPEAKER_11]: 49 years.

908
01:22:38,542 --> 01:22:40,424
[SPEAKER_11]: And you guys are talking again about equality.

909
01:22:40,484 --> 01:22:42,486
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, Boston Fire makes $150,000.

910
01:22:44,946 --> 01:22:49,748
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't make close of that and we get laughed out of the city hall for trying to negotiate that.

911
01:22:51,308 --> 01:22:54,369
[SPEAKER_11]: So just a point of information there.

912
01:22:55,069 --> 01:23:01,132
[SPEAKER_11]: It's sad that it's come to this and I don't know what kind of rules, are there rules to this meeting?

913
01:23:01,492 --> 01:23:03,832
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you guys following the Robert rules or anything like that?

914
01:23:04,213 --> 01:23:05,153
[SPEAKER_11]: Or is it just a meeting?

915
01:23:05,782 --> 01:23:07,183
[SPEAKER_06]: been following the rules, are there rules?

916
01:23:07,264 --> 01:23:18,254
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I'm confused because Councilor Collins made a four-year motion that Councilor Zhang seconded, and then Councilor Zhang made a motion for two years.

917
01:23:18,855 --> 01:23:22,639
[SPEAKER_11]: Would that not be an amendment to the motion, or is it just taking a bunch of motions?

918
01:23:22,799 --> 01:23:23,920
[SPEAKER_06]: They filed as separate motions.

919
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:26,763
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll take them in order, and we'll read the full language.

920
01:23:26,963 --> 01:23:28,445
[SPEAKER_06]: We haven't taken votes on the motions.

921
01:23:29,005 --> 01:23:32,266
[SPEAKER_06]: I made my choices chair that I wanted to hear from the public before we.

922
01:23:32,506 --> 01:23:33,906
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just trying to for clarification.

923
01:23:34,146 --> 01:23:36,046
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no, they're separate motions.

924
01:23:37,547 --> 01:23:37,827
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

925
01:23:37,847 --> 01:23:40,687
[SPEAKER_06]: There may be further amendments to the motions, but we'll take them in the order that.

926
01:23:40,807 --> 01:23:47,068
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, I just want to reiterate, we settled for a little around 3% and that would take 49 years to get that.

927
01:23:47,228 --> 01:23:48,749
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's a little food for thought.

928
01:23:49,569 --> 01:23:49,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

929
01:23:50,249 --> 01:23:51,689
[SPEAKER_06]: We do now have some hands on zoom.

930
01:23:52,289 --> 01:23:55,750
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to go to Paul Garrity on zoom and then I'll come back to the podium.

931
01:23:59,056 --> 01:24:00,637
[SPEAKER_06]: Paul, name and address for the record, please.

932
01:24:01,778 --> 01:24:02,379
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening.

933
01:24:02,399 --> 01:24:06,802
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Paul Geraghty, 40 Cedar Road in Medford.

934
01:24:06,822 --> 01:24:13,807
[SPEAKER_00]: During tonight's conversation, I heard a number of items mentioned relative to the amendments.

935
01:24:13,947 --> 01:24:16,409
[SPEAKER_00]: One was a regular evaluation.

936
01:24:16,429 --> 01:24:22,054
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one was passing this before the city charter for you.

937
01:24:22,614 --> 01:24:28,979
[SPEAKER_00]: My question is if it's in this the charter committee with

938
01:24:29,628 --> 01:24:33,592
[SPEAKER_00]: some sort of evaluation process put in place.

939
01:24:34,233 --> 01:24:37,856
[SPEAKER_00]: Will there be any wording to the effect about metrics for performance?

940
01:24:37,977 --> 01:24:41,640
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hearing evaluations and the job we're going to do.

941
01:24:42,001 --> 01:24:46,686
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'd like to see somewhere along the line some standards that the committees have to be held.

942
01:24:46,726 --> 01:24:51,270
[SPEAKER_00]: Some major project has to be completed, some proposal that's being funded for the year.

943
01:24:51,631 --> 01:24:52,812
[SPEAKER_00]: But somewhere along the line,

944
01:24:53,633 --> 01:25:11,876
[SPEAKER_00]: If the members of the council and the school committee are looking for pay and pay for performance, I would like to have some wording in the final writing of the bill, if it goes forward, in terms of specific metrics for performance.

945
01:25:11,936 --> 01:25:13,376
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they're reached, fine.

946
01:25:13,416 --> 01:25:18,717
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're not reached, then there needs to be some kind of consequences or other alternatives.

947
01:25:18,757 --> 01:25:21,218
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't want to catch a cold.

948
01:25:21,698 --> 01:25:22,018
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

949
01:25:24,278 --> 01:25:24,859
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Paul.

950
01:25:24,959 --> 01:25:28,763
[SPEAKER_06]: I do not know that we have the authority to implement that.

951
01:25:29,904 --> 01:25:33,107
[SPEAKER_06]: Certainly under this process, I don't know if the charter process would be different.

952
01:25:37,031 --> 01:25:37,632
[SPEAKER_06]: Go to the podium.

953
01:25:37,672 --> 01:25:38,733
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address for the record, please.

954
01:25:39,173 --> 01:25:39,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi there.

955
01:25:39,454 --> 01:25:40,455
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Maureen Lavin.

956
01:25:40,475 --> 01:25:43,298
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a teacher in the metropolitan public school system at the Andrews.

957
01:25:44,102 --> 01:25:47,963
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, again, I had no intention of speaking tonight, but I guess I can't help myself.

958
01:25:48,543 --> 01:25:50,684
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, a couple of things.

959
01:25:51,504 --> 01:25:54,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it seems like everybody's all over the place.

960
01:25:55,345 --> 01:25:58,805
[SPEAKER_05]: So to put a vote forward would seem crazy.

961
01:25:58,865 --> 01:26:04,927
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that, like, getting numbers and whatnot in order seems like that's what you folks are going to do, which is great.

962
01:26:05,847 --> 01:26:10,310
[SPEAKER_05]: because it's confusing sitting here listening to all kinds of numbers flying around.

963
01:26:10,710 --> 01:26:18,215
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I don't think anybody is opposed to anybody getting a pay increase, but correct me if I'm wrong.

964
01:26:18,835 --> 01:26:20,896
[SPEAKER_05]: These are stipend positions, right?

965
01:26:21,517 --> 01:26:22,317
[SPEAKER_05]: Are these stipends?

966
01:26:23,518 --> 01:26:23,998
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm asking.

967
01:26:24,959 --> 01:26:26,079
[SPEAKER_06]: In what sense?

968
01:26:26,439 --> 01:26:27,640
[SPEAKER_06]: I receive a weekly paycheck.

969
01:26:28,201 --> 01:26:31,783
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a weekly paycheck, but is it considered a stipend?

970
01:26:32,785 --> 01:26:34,466
[SPEAKER_06]: The school committee?

971
01:26:34,526 --> 01:26:37,508
[SPEAKER_06]: We're W-2 employees at the city of the school districts.

972
01:26:38,328 --> 01:26:39,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, okay.

973
01:26:39,469 --> 01:26:56,958
[SPEAKER_05]: So my concern is that the huge increase given the state of what's happening in our schools, which has been brought up by many people, but this is a part-time position, right?

974
01:26:57,038 --> 01:27:01,360
[SPEAKER_05]: And somebody spoke to making a living wage

975
01:27:03,131 --> 01:27:05,553
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, this is not a living wage position.

976
01:27:06,494 --> 01:27:10,177
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want a living wage, go get a full time job.

977
01:27:11,358 --> 01:27:12,659
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'm a teacher.

978
01:27:13,740 --> 01:27:16,743
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've always had two jobs while teaching.

979
01:27:16,763 --> 01:27:23,349
[SPEAKER_05]: The only time I haven't had two jobs is when I was paying for my own advanced education.

980
01:27:24,950 --> 01:27:26,231
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's how we get like a

981
01:27:27,580 --> 01:27:30,081
[SPEAKER_05]: a better pay increase, which has been brought up.

982
01:27:30,662 --> 01:27:41,907
[SPEAKER_05]: Because otherwise, as teachers, the more we work, the less we make, because don't forget, many other unions here, they get overtime, we do not.

983
01:27:43,348 --> 01:27:46,650
[SPEAKER_05]: And the paraprofessionals that spoke last week,

984
01:27:49,179 --> 01:27:59,229
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think anybody meant to offend anybody, but those paraprofessionals tend to be the ones that are in those high needs classrooms.

985
01:27:59,389 --> 01:28:05,134
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't think that the general public understands what that is on a day-to-day basis.

986
01:28:05,175 --> 01:28:09,179
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think anybody was trying to offend anybody, but I really,

987
01:28:12,327 --> 01:28:18,828
[SPEAKER_05]: would like to see folks visit our schools and see what the day-to-day is for us.

988
01:28:20,408 --> 01:28:22,709
[SPEAKER_05]: We have trouble getting substitutes.

989
01:28:23,029 --> 01:28:27,990
[SPEAKER_05]: School committee, come on down, spend a day once a week and sub at a different school in a different subject.

990
01:28:28,310 --> 01:28:30,890
[SPEAKER_05]: As a paraprofessional, see what our day-to-day is.

991
01:28:31,650 --> 01:28:33,731
[SPEAKER_05]: It's important that we see the whole picture.

992
01:28:35,191 --> 01:28:41,132
[SPEAKER_05]: And there was many conversations that took place that, oh, I didn't realize that's what was happening in the schools.

993
01:28:42,062 --> 01:28:46,944
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, how can you speak to that if you don't know what's happening in the schools?

994
01:28:47,684 --> 01:28:56,508
[SPEAKER_05]: So I really, as city councilors, I really hope that you dig in a little bit deeper into what's actually happening in the school systems.

995
01:28:57,884 --> 01:29:02,925
[SPEAKER_05]: We've had rain, a lot of rain, and the schools were affected by that.

996
01:29:03,806 --> 01:29:05,046
[SPEAKER_05]: This is not something new.

997
01:29:05,146 --> 01:29:08,967
[SPEAKER_05]: It just was over the top with the amount of rain that took place.

998
01:29:09,347 --> 01:29:12,088
[SPEAKER_05]: But every day, the buildings leak.

999
01:29:12,448 --> 01:29:13,728
[SPEAKER_05]: This is not anything new.

1000
01:29:14,468 --> 01:29:16,529
[SPEAKER_05]: We have problems with our facilities.

1001
01:29:17,769 --> 01:29:19,629
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm gonna just back up one step.

1002
01:29:20,150 --> 01:29:20,870
[SPEAKER_05]: Our coaches,

1003
01:29:22,230 --> 01:29:27,635
[SPEAKER_05]: and our paraprofessionals need to get a better salary.

1004
01:29:29,056 --> 01:29:30,097
[SPEAKER_05]: than what's happening.

1005
01:29:30,658 --> 01:29:41,527
[SPEAKER_05]: It would make no sense at all to put a huge increase into the school committee before our full-time paraprofessionals.

1006
01:29:42,068 --> 01:29:47,092
[SPEAKER_05]: And our coaches, like Anthony said, haven't had an increase.

1007
01:29:47,152 --> 01:29:54,919
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably the lowest paying salary or the stipends, because they get stipends, one of the lowest paid stipends in the area.

1008
01:29:55,720 --> 01:30:00,064
[SPEAKER_05]: So I do appreciate the data.

1009
01:30:00,184 --> 01:30:01,305
[SPEAKER_05]: We all like data.

1010
01:30:02,505 --> 01:30:07,529
[SPEAKER_05]: What do the school committees make in other districts that are similar to ours?

1011
01:30:08,130 --> 01:30:10,992
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody's making 20 plus thousand dollars.

1012
01:30:11,052 --> 01:30:11,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody is.

1013
01:30:12,894 --> 01:30:13,914
[SPEAKER_05]: Somerville is 15.

1014
01:30:13,994 --> 01:30:14,655
[SPEAKER_05]: I looked that up.

1015
01:30:14,795 --> 01:30:16,016
[SPEAKER_05]: Melrose, guess what they make?

1016
01:30:16,296 --> 01:30:16,817
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing.

1017
01:30:17,557 --> 01:30:18,518
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't make anything.

1018
01:30:19,138 --> 01:30:20,279
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a volunteer position.

1019
01:30:20,319 --> 01:30:24,443
[SPEAKER_05]: We appreciate that you're here doing a service for our community.

1020
01:30:26,064 --> 01:30:30,845
[SPEAKER_05]: But you can't expect a fair wage.

1021
01:30:31,365 --> 01:30:32,646
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a full-time job.

1022
01:30:33,026 --> 01:30:35,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Go get a job and then do this part-time.

1023
01:30:35,647 --> 01:30:39,868
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a full-time job and I have a part-time job because I'm a teacher.

1024
01:30:40,328 --> 01:30:41,308
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what we do.

1025
01:30:41,408 --> 01:30:42,329
[SPEAKER_05]: We have two jobs.

1026
01:30:42,729 --> 01:30:50,871
[SPEAKER_05]: And now I have to come here tonight when I'm exhausted from working two jobs because I'm trying to fight for the rest of us.

1027
01:30:51,511 --> 01:30:59,683
[SPEAKER_05]: So please consider that I don't know, I you know, I hope that there's more that goes on than one against everybody.

1028
01:30:59,863 --> 01:31:01,866
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope that you guys can collaborate.

1029
01:31:02,326 --> 01:31:04,109
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that's how things get done.

1030
01:31:04,429 --> 01:31:07,133
[SPEAKER_05]: When you work together, see each other's point of view.

1031
01:31:07,473 --> 01:31:07,934
[SPEAKER_05]: And don't

1032
01:31:08,635 --> 01:31:09,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't just focus.

1033
01:31:09,875 --> 01:31:11,176
[SPEAKER_05]: We're programmed.

1034
01:31:11,576 --> 01:31:14,536
[SPEAKER_05]: You say yes, and everybody follows in line and says yes.

1035
01:31:14,576 --> 01:31:15,877
[SPEAKER_05]: And then that one person says no.

1036
01:31:16,157 --> 01:31:17,257
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's work together here.

1037
01:31:17,577 --> 01:31:20,037
[SPEAKER_05]: That's for the greater good of our community.

1038
01:31:20,077 --> 01:31:21,918
[SPEAKER_05]: And we need that from you people.

1039
01:31:22,318 --> 01:31:24,118
[SPEAKER_05]: And we need that from our school committee.

1040
01:31:24,398 --> 01:31:26,239
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm gonna leave, end with this.

1041
01:31:27,099 --> 01:31:30,700
[SPEAKER_05]: When I want a pay increase, I show up and ask for it.

1042
01:31:32,620 --> 01:31:36,301
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't see anybody here asking for a pay increase.

1043
01:31:37,714 --> 01:31:40,376
[SPEAKER_05]: When we want to pay increase, we ask for it.

1044
01:31:41,518 --> 01:31:44,340
[SPEAKER_05]: How many of the school committee members have asked for a raise?

1045
01:31:44,781 --> 01:31:47,803
[SPEAKER_05]: Because maybe they should be here and say, yes, I'd like a raise.

1046
01:31:48,164 --> 01:31:48,864
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I do not.

1047
01:31:49,405 --> 01:31:51,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, let's get a poll on who wants it.

1048
01:31:51,587 --> 01:31:57,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Because are we just going to give out a raise to a group of people that one person wants to raise?

1049
01:31:58,293 --> 01:31:59,854
[SPEAKER_05]: Or does the whole body want the raise?

1050
01:32:00,751 --> 01:32:07,372
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to work smarter here, and we need to take care of the people on the front line who deal with the children.

1051
01:32:07,733 --> 01:32:12,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Our kids are the most important thing, your kids are the most important thing, and we need to serve them fully.

1052
01:32:14,174 --> 01:32:15,014
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I have, thank you.

1053
01:32:16,134 --> 01:32:22,496
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to go to Gina Koffler on Zoom, and then I'll come back to Anna for you.

1054
01:32:22,516 --> 01:32:27,637
[SPEAKER_06]: Gina, you're gonna have to unmute.

1055
01:32:31,071 --> 01:32:32,772
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1056
01:32:33,672 --> 01:32:39,794
[SPEAKER_21]: Sorry, sorry, I was busy doing busy doing things, you know, things for the health of parents.

1057
01:32:40,294 --> 01:32:41,575
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's Gina Coppola.

1058
01:32:41,675 --> 01:32:48,797
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm president of the PEP professionals, Kids Corner, OTAs, PTAs, anything that has to do with assistance.

1059
01:32:49,798 --> 01:32:51,418
[SPEAKER_21]: First and foremost, let me apologize.

1060
01:32:51,438 --> 01:32:51,618
[SPEAKER_21]: Great.

1061
01:32:54,915 --> 01:32:57,659
[SPEAKER_21]: like mother and father, because I know what you go through every day.

1062
01:32:58,360 --> 01:33:01,805
[SPEAKER_21]: But I want to say that as 122 members, this has taken this is not

1063
01:33:05,868 --> 01:33:10,112
[SPEAKER_21]: a fight to say that a child comes in and fights a paraprofessional?

1064
01:33:10,272 --> 01:33:11,213
[SPEAKER_21]: Absolutely not.

1065
01:33:11,713 --> 01:33:22,122
[SPEAKER_21]: And another thing that was written to me in an email is that paraprofessionals go up to school committees and say about disabilities so that we can get more money.

1066
01:33:22,142 --> 01:33:23,984
[SPEAKER_21]: Hell no.

1067
01:33:24,984 --> 01:33:26,826
[SPEAKER_21]: Our kindergarten teachers are making $17,000.

1068
01:33:27,146 --> 01:33:33,152
[SPEAKER_21]: They're using Google Translate all day long on their own phones, not reimbursed.

1069
01:33:34,042 --> 01:33:42,368
[SPEAKER_21]: just to make sure, because I've always said to them, make sure that the child can say, I need to go to the bathroom, I need a drink of water.

1070
01:33:42,388 --> 01:33:45,210
[SPEAKER_21]: And they said to me, Don't worry about it.

1071
01:33:45,250 --> 01:33:46,791
[SPEAKER_21]: We have a Google Translate.

1072
01:33:46,931 --> 01:33:48,592
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, citizens pay for that.

1073
01:33:49,033 --> 01:33:49,513
[SPEAKER_21]: They don't care.

1074
01:33:49,693 --> 01:33:50,934
[SPEAKER_21]: They just care about races.

1075
01:33:51,114 --> 01:33:51,534
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

1076
01:33:52,035 --> 01:33:59,320
[SPEAKER_21]: So let's start with some sort of, you know, mechanism for useful tools, maybe a walkie

1077
01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:10,488
[SPEAKER_21]: hockey, maybe some kids get into the building, maybe a computer, maybe a translator, maybe paying for people that are changing diapers, for people that are cranking.

1078
01:34:11,008 --> 01:34:13,250
[SPEAKER_21]: So you don't know what we do.

1079
01:34:13,970 --> 01:34:16,892
[SPEAKER_21]: And I apologize if it looks like

1080
01:34:17,773 --> 01:34:18,774
[SPEAKER_21]: Is it the student's fault?

1081
01:34:18,955 --> 01:34:20,337
[SPEAKER_21]: Absolutely not.

1082
01:34:20,917 --> 01:34:23,000
[SPEAKER_21]: Students have nothing to do with this.

1083
01:34:23,481 --> 01:34:32,974
[SPEAKER_21]: They are every day fighting just to be the best person that they can be because we love kids with disabilities.

1084
01:34:33,014 --> 01:34:34,035
[SPEAKER_21]: We love any kids.

1085
01:34:34,896 --> 01:34:49,869
[SPEAKER_21]: And I can tell you that maybe if somebody said, okay, I got hurt in the eye, but that had nothing to do with the child, they're saying the job is a little volatile, not the child.

1086
01:34:50,649 --> 01:35:02,479
[SPEAKER_21]: So I really, I just want to, I want to say how we appreciate any student, but we are also called off onto the table every day.

1087
01:35:03,132 --> 01:35:03,673
[SPEAKER_21]: What did you say?

1088
01:35:03,713 --> 01:35:04,314
[SPEAKER_21]: What did you do?

1089
01:35:04,394 --> 01:35:05,135
[SPEAKER_21]: How did you handle it?

1090
01:35:05,395 --> 01:35:06,036
[SPEAKER_21]: Where did you go?

1091
01:35:06,076 --> 01:35:06,957
[SPEAKER_21]: Were you wearing perfume?

1092
01:35:06,977 --> 01:35:07,938
[SPEAKER_21]: Were you wearing lipstick?

1093
01:35:08,198 --> 01:35:09,239
[SPEAKER_21]: Did you eat tuna fish?

1094
01:35:09,520 --> 01:35:10,561
[SPEAKER_21]: Did you have a cup of coffee?

1095
01:35:10,601 --> 01:35:12,944
[SPEAKER_21]: Where's your phone?

1096
01:35:13,404 --> 01:35:14,886
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey, enough.

1097
01:35:16,068 --> 01:35:16,869
[SPEAKER_21]: Listen to us.

1098
01:35:17,069 --> 01:35:18,170
[SPEAKER_21]: We're here to educate.

1099
01:35:18,931 --> 01:35:21,194
[SPEAKER_21]: And we educate when we educate.

1100
01:35:22,020 --> 01:35:26,023
[SPEAKER_21]: We belong, we educate the community, not just the child.

1101
01:35:26,784 --> 01:35:37,713
[SPEAKER_21]: So I appreciate Ian, Councilor Ian, for even saying paraprofessionals, because nobody has ever said that word before in any chambers, including the mayor.

1102
01:35:38,554 --> 01:35:41,156
[SPEAKER_21]: And George, you know, we love you down here.

1103
01:35:41,176 --> 01:35:42,637
[SPEAKER_21]: So I appreciate you.

1104
01:35:43,378 --> 01:35:47,261
[SPEAKER_21]: And other councillors, I trust in you.

1105
01:35:47,722 --> 01:35:48,903
[SPEAKER_21]: I know you'll do the right thing.

1106
01:35:49,915 --> 01:35:55,638
[SPEAKER_21]: but 17,000 translating people, changing practice, breaking people.

1107
01:35:55,658 --> 01:35:57,999
[SPEAKER_21]: No, not good at all.

1108
01:35:58,539 --> 01:36:01,761
[SPEAKER_21]: So let's show some spirit, some community spirit.

1109
01:36:02,421 --> 01:36:14,888
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's have the school committee come to all members, teachers, and every public employee, and sit at the table just like we do, and negotiate with us this time.

1110
01:36:15,548 --> 01:36:19,470
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll negotiate with you for a raise, just like we're told there's no money.

1111
01:36:20,885 --> 01:36:26,951
[SPEAKER_21]: I thank you for your time, Councilor Bears and everybody else, and I appreciate all my co-workers that are up here speaking for me.

1112
01:36:27,992 --> 01:36:28,533
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1113
01:36:28,593 --> 01:36:29,154
[SPEAKER_21]: God bless.

1114
01:36:31,876 --> 01:36:32,357
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Gina.

1115
01:36:32,377 --> 01:36:38,303
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I have your name and address for the record, please?

1116
01:36:39,144 --> 01:36:43,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Hannah Silberman, 15 Maynard in Bedford.

1117
01:36:44,857 --> 01:36:51,166
[SPEAKER_04]: I teach at Roberts Elementary School, and again, that's the second largest school in the district, second only to Medford High School.

1118
01:36:51,967 --> 01:37:00,940
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, if we're going to talk about equity, I think that we should start with our zoning and redistricting issues that lead to inequitable student numbers in our elementary schools.

1119
01:37:01,894 --> 01:37:19,324
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're wondering why our chamber is a bit empty this evening it's because teachers are really frustrated really disheartened by this whole resolution and feel that it's hopeless to be here that there was no point in us being here tonight, and that you've already made up your minds anyways, just like last time is what I heard today.

1120
01:37:20,182 --> 01:37:33,849
[SPEAKER_04]: What I heard last time we were here was that a lot of the issues that we raised were news to you, that you were grateful to us for bringing these issues to your attention, and you asked us to please come to more city council meetings and make our voices heard.

1121
01:37:34,970 --> 01:37:36,370
[SPEAKER_04]: And listen, we're tired.

1122
01:37:36,771 --> 01:37:40,132
[SPEAKER_04]: It's already past my bedtime, and these kids don't teach themselves.

1123
01:37:40,793 --> 01:37:42,614
[SPEAKER_04]: This job gets harder every single year.

1124
01:37:43,334 --> 01:37:50,179
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was my understanding that it's the job of the school committee to inform you of issues pertaining to the schools, not our job.

1125
01:37:50,820 --> 01:37:55,343
[SPEAKER_04]: And if the school committee is not doing their job, then why are we giving them such a huge raise?

1126
01:37:56,644 --> 01:38:07,492
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems like City Council would rather spend school funding repairing the relationship with school committee than repairing our flooding, molding buildings.

1127
01:38:08,453 --> 01:38:14,357
[SPEAKER_04]: City Council gets to vote on giving themselves and giving a school committee, giving school committee a raise whenever they want.

1128
01:38:14,898 --> 01:38:17,620
[SPEAKER_04]: Teachers, however, do not get to give ourselves a raise.

1129
01:38:18,140 --> 01:38:22,303
[SPEAKER_04]: We stand outside in the freezing cold with signs for a 3% raise.

1130
01:38:22,784 --> 01:38:26,867
[SPEAKER_04]: We bust our tails continuing our education with the latest best practices.

1131
01:38:27,407 --> 01:38:33,932
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to constantly fund our own education on our teacher salaries while working multiple jobs.

1132
01:38:34,775 --> 01:38:39,238
[SPEAKER_04]: With every tone-deaf resolution like this passed, Medford loses more and more credibility.

1133
01:38:40,079 --> 01:38:46,944
[SPEAKER_04]: Who would want to work for a school district that puts more money and more funding into administration than school and student support?

1134
01:38:47,885 --> 01:38:54,489
[SPEAKER_04]: This resolution is going to give the mayor an extra 30-ish thousand dollars a year from our school budget.

1135
01:38:55,350 --> 01:39:01,735
[SPEAKER_04]: There's already a very limited pool of funding, and taking away from that is going to decrease the chances of student success.

1136
01:39:03,035 --> 01:39:07,158
[SPEAKER_04]: You say that school committee should be representative of the city of Medford.

1137
01:39:07,698 --> 01:39:08,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, absolutely.

1138
01:39:09,560 --> 01:39:10,520
[SPEAKER_04]: And so should our schools.

1139
01:39:11,381 --> 01:39:14,944
[SPEAKER_04]: You're saying that you need the salaries to be competitive.

1140
01:39:15,524 --> 01:39:16,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, absolutely.

1141
01:39:16,925 --> 01:39:17,606
[SPEAKER_04]: And so do we.

1142
01:39:18,486 --> 01:39:21,748
[SPEAKER_04]: We are trying to get the best applicants possible to work with our students.

1143
01:39:22,609 --> 01:39:25,030
[SPEAKER_04]: And to do so, we have to attract those applicants.

1144
01:39:25,551 --> 01:39:31,093
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a continued list every single week in the superintendent's email of positions we cannot fill.

1145
01:39:31,754 --> 01:39:35,175
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we want to fill those positions, our salaries need to be competitive.

1146
01:39:35,836 --> 01:39:36,816
[SPEAKER_04]: And they are not right now.

1147
01:39:40,178 --> 01:39:43,700
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is why all of these positions have been open since the beginning of the school year.

1148
01:39:45,060 --> 01:39:59,008
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're using the school budget, then we should be talking about using this money on people that our students see every single day in front of them, that they can learn from, that they can connect with, not a politician who stops by the school once a year for a photo op.

1149
01:39:59,888 --> 01:40:07,873
[SPEAKER_04]: Giving the school committee members a raise is one thing, but giving them a raise of this size from our already underfunded school budget is fiscally irresponsible.

1150
01:40:08,513 --> 01:40:12,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Please do the right thing and spend school funding on what's important, the students.

1151
01:40:13,136 --> 01:40:13,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1152
01:40:20,515 --> 01:40:24,179
[SPEAKER_06]: Seeing no other hands raised on Zoom, I will go to the podium.

1153
01:40:25,781 --> 01:40:26,141
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1154
01:40:26,982 --> 01:40:29,065
[SPEAKER_13]: Harry McGillivray for Piedmont Road, Medford.

1155
01:40:30,775 --> 01:40:32,596
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a very interesting meeting.

1156
01:40:32,616 --> 01:40:35,217
[SPEAKER_13]: I've heard a lot of things that were really interesting tonight.

1157
01:40:35,817 --> 01:40:40,899
[SPEAKER_13]: I've been negotiating contracts with the city since 2002 for the police patrolman's union.

1158
01:40:41,499 --> 01:40:42,640
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm no longer in that union.

1159
01:40:42,680 --> 01:40:44,280
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm in the supervisor's union.

1160
01:40:44,300 --> 01:40:52,583
[SPEAKER_13]: And I have a position on that executive board, but I have a decent amount of experience negotiating contracts.

1161
01:40:53,284 --> 01:40:55,525
[SPEAKER_13]: And a couple of things jumped out at me tonight.

1162
01:40:55,565 --> 01:40:58,526
[SPEAKER_13]: Like when I heard Councilor Zang talk about inflation,

1163
01:40:59,426 --> 01:41:01,728
[SPEAKER_13]: We're not allowed to bring inflation up at the table.

1164
01:41:02,349 --> 01:41:10,017
[SPEAKER_13]: So when we signed our last contract, gallon of gas was probably $1.99, home heating, oil was probably $2.39.

1165
01:41:10,057 --> 01:41:12,720
[SPEAKER_13]: No one cares.

1166
01:41:13,040 --> 01:41:14,822
[SPEAKER_13]: When we're at the bargaining table, no one cares.

1167
01:41:16,860 --> 01:41:19,281
[SPEAKER_13]: I think President Buckley can back me up on this.

1168
01:41:19,341 --> 01:41:21,501
[SPEAKER_13]: We talk about COLA like it's a cost of living.

1169
01:41:21,901 --> 01:41:28,823
[SPEAKER_13]: We have never received a raise in the 20 plus years that I've been negotiating contracts that rises up to a cost of living.

1170
01:41:28,883 --> 01:41:30,103
[SPEAKER_13]: It's always about one and a half, 2%.

1171
01:41:30,563 --> 01:41:31,823
[SPEAKER_13]: Am I right to say that, Eddie?

1172
01:41:33,023 --> 01:41:37,124
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm not gonna, I make a good salary.

1173
01:41:37,164 --> 01:41:38,004
[SPEAKER_13]: I love my job.

1174
01:41:38,805 --> 01:41:39,885
[SPEAKER_13]: This is what I wanted to do.

1175
01:41:40,645 --> 01:41:44,426
[SPEAKER_13]: But you know, you mentioned Somerville.

1176
01:41:45,933 --> 01:41:47,736
[SPEAKER_13]: They didn't want to be the first ones.

1177
01:41:47,756 --> 01:41:49,619
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, that's what the MMA's purpose is.

1178
01:41:50,260 --> 01:42:00,355
[SPEAKER_13]: The MMA's purpose is to collaborate and tell each other, don't give the firemen this, don't give the teachers that, don't give the police this, because if you do, we all have to do it.

1179
01:42:01,196 --> 01:42:01,376
[SPEAKER_13]: So

1180
01:42:04,542 --> 01:42:10,285
[SPEAKER_13]: We all have to stay together on this side of the room as bargaining units, teachers, fire, police.

1181
01:42:10,866 --> 01:42:14,147
[SPEAKER_13]: And when we get there, we deal with canceled meetings.

1182
01:42:14,688 --> 01:42:16,829
[SPEAKER_13]: We deal with, sorry, not enough.

1183
01:42:17,389 --> 01:42:22,072
[SPEAKER_13]: We deal with, our staffing's been down since 2000 and probably six.

1184
01:42:22,632 --> 01:42:27,535
[SPEAKER_13]: We've never met the staffing levels that we were promised.

1185
01:42:27,895 --> 01:42:29,676
[SPEAKER_13]: Equipment, we deal with all that stuff.

1186
01:42:30,497 --> 01:42:30,657
[SPEAKER_13]: So,

1187
01:42:32,404 --> 01:42:36,607
[SPEAKER_13]: Any union member would never say they're against the pay raise.

1188
01:42:37,207 --> 01:42:46,053
[SPEAKER_13]: No one's against anybody receiving a pay raise or an increase in benefits or a better wage package, anything that will improve the quality of life.

1189
01:42:46,653 --> 01:42:49,515
[SPEAKER_13]: What we are saying is let's treat everybody fairly.

1190
01:42:50,075 --> 01:42:56,999
[SPEAKER_13]: I would love to get a four-year deal that Councilor Collins proposed.

1191
01:42:57,019 --> 01:42:58,840
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a tremendous four-year deal.

1192
01:42:59,887 --> 01:43:03,650
[SPEAKER_13]: So, and then one last comment which really caught my attention.

1193
01:43:03,690 --> 01:43:05,351
[SPEAKER_13]: I heard about renters.

1194
01:43:05,911 --> 01:43:10,695
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I'm a homeowner in this city, so go easy on me when you wanna raise my taxes.

1195
01:43:10,735 --> 01:43:12,976
[SPEAKER_13]: I got three kids I'm paying college tuitions on.

1196
01:43:13,417 --> 01:43:15,198
[SPEAKER_13]: So, go easy, thank you.

1197
01:43:15,598 --> 01:43:16,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for your comment.

1198
01:43:20,582 --> 01:43:21,843
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address for the record, please.

1199
01:43:22,543 --> 01:43:23,724
[SPEAKER_20]: Doreen O'Hare, 325 Malden Street in Medford.

1200
01:43:29,190 --> 01:43:44,663
[SPEAKER_20]: I am appalled that this snuck under the radar, the last meeting in December, when city councilors were leaving conveniently, new members join.

1201
01:43:44,683 --> 01:43:54,671
[SPEAKER_20]: I think you need to take a look and educate everyone, because these motions flying around don't make any sense to anyone.

1202
01:43:55,131 --> 01:43:56,652
[SPEAKER_20]: on this side of the fence, OK?

1203
01:43:57,212 --> 01:44:06,338
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'll tell you, to sit there and say you want to file a motion for every year incremental increases is absurd.

1204
01:44:06,778 --> 01:44:08,599
[SPEAKER_20]: You don't know what the budget's going to be.

1205
01:44:09,060 --> 01:44:13,823
[SPEAKER_20]: So how can you just say, we're going to just automatically do this, blindfolded?

1206
01:44:15,074 --> 01:44:30,689
[SPEAKER_20]: And the main thing that I heard tonight, and this is really what got me up here, is the fact that somebody reported that a paraprofessional that came to this meeting and brought facts to the table

1207
01:44:32,523 --> 01:44:35,104
[SPEAKER_20]: were tried to be silenced, are you kidding me?

1208
01:44:36,284 --> 01:44:47,107
[SPEAKER_20]: Every single one of you on this panel needs to look in the mirror every day and realize we have some serious fiscal concerns in this community.

1209
01:44:47,667 --> 01:44:51,148
[SPEAKER_20]: We are severely underfunded across the board.

1210
01:44:51,868 --> 01:44:55,249
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not like anybody's got huge amounts of money flying around.

1211
01:44:56,260 --> 01:45:01,224
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, to Councilor Scarpelli's point, the ARPA money, right?

1212
01:45:01,424 --> 01:45:01,964
[SPEAKER_20]: It's gone.

1213
01:45:02,344 --> 01:45:05,547
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, we need to look at that and be fiscally responsible.

1214
01:45:09,301 --> 01:45:17,807
[SPEAKER_20]: I have never been so passionate about this community as I am right now.

1215
01:45:18,868 --> 01:45:22,451
[SPEAKER_20]: Because I'm talking to the people of the community of Medford right now.

1216
01:45:23,332 --> 01:45:26,834
[SPEAKER_20]: Wake up, show up, and pay attention.

1217
01:45:28,055 --> 01:45:35,140
[SPEAKER_20]: Because these people were voted in on a platform, okay?

1218
01:45:35,481 --> 01:45:37,962
[SPEAKER_20]: So you can sit there and vote on your platform,

1219
01:45:39,036 --> 01:45:44,899
[SPEAKER_20]: But the people here are the ones that are gonna vote you in next time.

1220
01:45:46,299 --> 01:45:52,682
[SPEAKER_20]: So think of it and really please do right by our community because we need you.

1221
01:45:53,242 --> 01:45:55,443
[SPEAKER_20]: We need your vote on common sense.

1222
01:45:56,524 --> 01:45:56,864
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1223
01:46:07,432 --> 01:46:14,659
[SPEAKER_22]: Good evening, James Chippell Larry 30 Norwich Circle, Medford, lifelong resident, and a Medford taxpayer.

1224
01:46:16,875 --> 01:46:18,796
[SPEAKER_22]: a couple things brought up tonight.

1225
01:46:19,496 --> 01:46:23,758
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Scarpelli asked for a meeting with the school committee to sit down and talk about this.

1226
01:46:23,818 --> 01:46:25,999
[SPEAKER_22]: I was surprised this was not brought in as a motion.

1227
01:46:26,919 --> 01:46:29,760
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think that issue has been brought up for years.

1228
01:46:30,360 --> 01:46:37,563
[SPEAKER_22]: The school committee and the city council need to sit down and talk about what's going on budget-wise.

1229
01:46:38,704 --> 01:46:43,466
[SPEAKER_22]: It's important so the people who have children in our schools know what's taking place.

1230
01:46:44,451 --> 01:46:48,174
[SPEAKER_22]: The other problem that's going on, we were promised a new firehouse.

1231
01:46:49,695 --> 01:46:50,836
[SPEAKER_22]: Haven't seen that yet, have we?

1232
01:46:52,077 --> 01:46:56,861
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, so we're gonna give the school committee members a raise and still not have a firehouse.

1233
01:46:58,242 --> 01:47:01,765
[SPEAKER_22]: Last time I spoke, I think I talked about everybody coming together.

1234
01:47:02,365 --> 01:47:09,410
[SPEAKER_22]: There's a lot of empty storefronts in Medford, but you go to Winchester, Stoneham, Malden, Somerville,

1235
01:47:10,589 --> 01:47:15,352
[SPEAKER_22]: Arlington, not a lot of empty storefronts, a lot of businesses doing a great job.

1236
01:47:15,932 --> 01:47:21,015
[SPEAKER_22]: You can go to Winchester on a Friday night, five restaurants all within walking distance, always packed.

1237
01:47:21,976 --> 01:47:25,478
[SPEAKER_22]: Go to Malden, same thing, five restaurants, always packed.

1238
01:47:25,958 --> 01:47:29,340
[SPEAKER_22]: And I see you shaking your head because you agree with me, Mr. Beals, correct?

1239
01:47:30,440 --> 01:47:32,622
[SPEAKER_22]: We could have a stronger business district, I agree.

1240
01:47:33,740 --> 01:47:35,581
[SPEAKER_22]: So why are we worried about that?

1241
01:47:36,302 --> 01:47:38,343
[SPEAKER_22]: Again, no school committee members here tonight.

1242
01:47:38,703 --> 01:47:40,925
[SPEAKER_22]: The people who wanted this are not here.

1243
01:47:41,485 --> 01:47:43,747
[SPEAKER_22]: The person- There's one school committee member here.

1244
01:47:44,267 --> 01:47:47,169
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm sorry.

1245
01:47:47,629 --> 01:47:49,030
[SPEAKER_22]: But she didn't bring this up.

1246
01:47:49,951 --> 01:47:54,614
[SPEAKER_22]: She did not bring this up and she spoke at that last meeting saying she was not in favor of this.

1247
01:47:55,114 --> 01:47:59,177
[SPEAKER_22]: And the person who brought this up is not here either to reinforce it.

1248
01:48:00,558 --> 01:48:02,219
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, this is what I talk about.

1249
01:48:02,759 --> 01:48:05,761
[SPEAKER_22]: This city is so split right now, okay?

1250
01:48:06,582 --> 01:48:08,723
[SPEAKER_22]: So many different sides against each other.

1251
01:48:09,583 --> 01:48:10,804
[SPEAKER_22]: We need to come together.

1252
01:48:11,244 --> 01:48:12,165
[SPEAKER_22]: It starts right here.

1253
01:48:12,585 --> 01:48:15,107
[SPEAKER_22]: The seven of you, bring this city together.

1254
01:48:15,607 --> 01:48:16,628
[SPEAKER_22]: Don't pass this.

1255
01:48:17,248 --> 01:48:18,749
[SPEAKER_22]: People are still without contracts.

1256
01:48:19,549 --> 01:48:20,970
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm a custodian of the school system.

1257
01:48:21,631 --> 01:48:24,792
[SPEAKER_22]: I was out there at five o'clock this morning, getting the school ready.

1258
01:48:26,013 --> 01:48:28,815
[SPEAKER_22]: And I still haven't had a contract in two and a half years.

1259
01:48:30,390 --> 01:48:32,011
[SPEAKER_22]: All right, let's do the right thing.

1260
01:48:32,031 --> 01:48:34,993
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'm gonna close by saying one thing.

1261
01:48:35,614 --> 01:48:38,516
[SPEAKER_22]: My wife spoke earlier, 33 years as a teacher.

1262
01:48:38,976 --> 01:48:39,937
[SPEAKER_22]: This is her last year.

1263
01:48:40,337 --> 01:48:46,641
[SPEAKER_22]: So next year when they hire somebody to take her job, that job's only gonna be a $60,000 job, okay?

1264
01:48:47,322 --> 01:48:48,783
[SPEAKER_22]: If that, thank you.

1265
01:48:54,807 --> 01:48:56,068
[SPEAKER_06]: And an address for the record, please.

1266
01:48:56,718 --> 01:48:57,839
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, I'm Jessica Taddeo.

1267
01:48:57,899 --> 01:48:59,880
[SPEAKER_01]: I live at 50 Fellsview Ave in Medford.

1268
01:49:01,020 --> 01:49:07,164
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to first acknowledge before I begin speaking that I'm not necessarily coming up here in support of one side or the other.

1269
01:49:07,184 --> 01:49:11,366
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to, you know, offer some thoughts about what I've been hearing.

1270
01:49:11,506 --> 01:49:13,828
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate the teachers showing up in full force.

1271
01:49:13,848 --> 01:49:14,988
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry I have my back to you.

1272
01:49:15,028 --> 01:49:17,630
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels wrong, but I appreciate the discourse tonight.

1273
01:49:17,670 --> 01:49:19,531
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate the openness of the council to hear.

1274
01:49:20,211 --> 01:49:29,379
[SPEAKER_01]: the public debate, but I do want to encourage all of you on both sides of this debate that there is a moral responsibility to have this argument with all of the facts and all of the understanding.

1275
01:49:30,039 --> 01:49:36,765
[SPEAKER_01]: From my understanding, this would not come at the direct cost of teachers.

1276
01:49:37,005 --> 01:49:42,369
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't believe that this council is sitting here and saying we either give money to these teachers now or give it to

1277
01:49:43,930 --> 01:49:44,991
[SPEAKER_01]: the elected officials.

1278
01:49:45,451 --> 01:49:52,076
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also my understanding that you don't necessarily have jurisdiction over the contracts if they're not up for debate.

1279
01:49:52,196 --> 01:50:02,944
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's also be mindful of that because people who are listening to this debate and may not be participating in the same capacity as we are, are gonna hear that and they're gonna walk away with an incorrect impression of how this issue plays out.

1280
01:50:03,704 --> 01:50:07,887
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is not to disagree with the teachers because I come from a family of teachers.

1281
01:50:09,408 --> 01:50:11,770
[SPEAKER_01]: My mother is a teacher, my grandmother is a teacher.

1282
01:50:12,959 --> 01:50:20,343
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I substitute teach in Lynn public schools, one, because my mother is an assistant principal there, but also because my free doesn't pay the subs enough.

1283
01:50:21,023 --> 01:50:25,966
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I have to make that decision for my well being in my economic situation.

1284
01:50:26,386 --> 01:50:33,290
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are also people who want to hold office and do hold office that are making those same calculations based on their economic decisions.

1285
01:50:33,750 --> 01:50:42,674
[SPEAKER_01]: And we should be able to have a conversation about pay increases without devaluing the work of teachers, but also not devaluing the work of elected officials.

1286
01:50:43,134 --> 01:50:45,195
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to do both of those jobs.

1287
01:50:45,335 --> 01:50:50,198
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to do them in conditions where you feel like people don't understand what you go through on a day-to-day basis.

1288
01:50:50,618 --> 01:50:57,401
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you're having this debate, please be mindful of what you want to see reflected in your elected office holders.

1289
01:50:57,481 --> 01:51:02,003
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably want teachers to run for office so you know that somebody's there

1290
01:51:02,423 --> 01:51:05,386
[SPEAKER_01]: that understands what the school looks like on a day to day basis.

1291
01:51:05,746 --> 01:51:11,912
[SPEAKER_01]: But teachers aren't going to go run for office if the pay isn't there because they know what it's like to have to stretch to make ends meet.

1292
01:51:12,352 --> 01:51:20,300
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, I understand that many of you have multiple sources of income and have multiple jobs, but we shouldn't accept that as like normal.

1293
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:22,802
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody should have to work three jobs.

1294
01:51:23,202 --> 01:51:32,049
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody should have to be a school teacher and pay your student loans and go to grad school, but also wait tables and also babysit and also do a million other things.

1295
01:51:32,429 --> 01:51:34,310
[SPEAKER_01]: We shouldn't accept that from anybody.

1296
01:51:34,831 --> 01:51:46,280
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also have to be mindful of when we're having these conversations about resolutions and pay cuts, is that not everyone is an established individual that owns property that

1297
01:51:47,100 --> 01:51:49,041
[SPEAKER_01]: can afford to take a pay cut.

1298
01:51:49,401 --> 01:51:54,242
[SPEAKER_01]: I lost my job earlier this year and it was a very difficult time for me and I'm still going through that.

1299
01:51:54,783 --> 01:51:58,324
[SPEAKER_01]: And people rent and that costs money and people lose their jobs all the time.

1300
01:51:58,404 --> 01:52:04,486
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just encourage everybody to be mindful about making false equivalencies, about devaluing any form of labor.

1301
01:52:05,126 --> 01:52:17,934
[SPEAKER_01]: and continue to have this discussion in good faith, but recognize the work of both sides, of our teachers, of our elected officials, and what's setting a standard of decorum, a standard of work, a standard of living.

1302
01:52:18,554 --> 01:52:22,397
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you going to establish when you pass this law, when you pass this ordinance?

1303
01:52:22,757 --> 01:52:23,497
[SPEAKER_01]: What does that mean?

1304
01:52:24,018 --> 01:52:28,680
[SPEAKER_01]: And I encourage you all to keep an open mind and understand that, you know, I

1305
01:52:29,882 --> 01:52:35,138
[SPEAKER_01]: voted for most of you up here and I would not have voted if I thought you were going to screw teachers and schools over.

1306
01:52:35,595 --> 01:52:36,896
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think that's the case.

1307
01:52:37,436 --> 01:52:42,538
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're not going to screw teachers and schools over because that's not what I voted you all in to do.

1308
01:52:42,638 --> 01:52:46,480
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I trust that you will be mindful and the optics are bad.

1309
01:52:46,520 --> 01:52:49,481
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe if there's a way to have this vote later, have it later.

1310
01:52:49,941 --> 01:52:56,984
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also encourage the schools, please do not devalue the elected officials that fight for you every day in their personal and their professional lives.

1311
01:52:57,285 --> 01:53:00,086
[SPEAKER_01]: Because a different city council probably wouldn't

1312
01:53:00,646 --> 01:53:02,288
[SPEAKER_01]: support you in the way that you would want.

1313
01:53:02,348 --> 01:53:04,130
[SPEAKER_01]: So I encourage you to think about that as well.

1314
01:53:05,471 --> 01:53:06,973
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you for your time, everyone.

1315
01:53:08,875 --> 01:53:09,175
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1316
01:53:10,982 --> 01:53:13,523
[SPEAKER_20]: name and address for the record.

1317
01:53:13,543 --> 01:53:15,543
[SPEAKER_20]: It's Dorino here, 325 Malden Street, Medford.

1318
01:53:16,384 --> 01:53:24,286
[SPEAKER_20]: Just two points that I forgot in my passionate discussion, and I didn't have any notes, so bear with me.

1319
01:53:24,746 --> 01:53:26,467
[SPEAKER_20]: Two things I'd like you to consider.

1320
01:53:27,267 --> 01:53:32,349
[SPEAKER_20]: We are expecting an increased volume of students, possibly due to migrants as well.

1321
01:53:33,349 --> 01:53:36,290
[SPEAKER_20]: And are we prepared if you voted

1322
01:53:37,893 --> 01:53:43,319
[SPEAKER_20]: to file this, let's say, an increase, are you prepared for a walkout from your teachers?

1323
01:53:44,500 --> 01:53:46,242
[SPEAKER_20]: Something to consider, because you know what?

1324
01:53:47,023 --> 01:53:49,666
[SPEAKER_20]: If they're not making a lot of money, I'd walk.

1325
01:53:50,928 --> 01:53:53,510
[SPEAKER_20]: And, you know, that's all.

1326
01:53:54,767 --> 01:53:59,830
[SPEAKER_20]: And it is definitely coming out of the budget of the school, because it could be used for the school.

1327
01:53:59,890 --> 01:54:02,432
[SPEAKER_20]: That was already discussed earlier.

1328
01:54:02,472 --> 01:54:08,415
[SPEAKER_20]: So this approval would impact the community, bottom line.

1329
01:54:08,435 --> 01:54:11,017
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1330
01:54:11,117 --> 01:54:13,598
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone else like to speak?

1331
01:54:14,379 --> 01:54:15,980
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone on public participation, anyone on Zoom?

1332
01:54:19,615 --> 01:54:19,715
[SPEAKER_06]: that.

1333
01:54:20,276 --> 01:54:38,008
[SPEAKER_06]: If I may, Councilor Tseng just before, and this will be pretty much all I have to say, and then I'll try to go through the motions, and I did also try to given the feedback of the audience tried to put these proposals into a graphical representation, which I'll show, which should make it easier for us to understand and compare them.

1334
01:54:40,114 --> 01:54:41,454
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate everything that's been said.

1335
01:54:41,514 --> 01:54:43,815
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we're going through the deliberative process.

1336
01:54:43,855 --> 01:54:53,498
[SPEAKER_06]: Something that I said in December was that it was an initial proposal that would be considered and further vetted by the council, which we're doing this evening and may continue.

1337
01:54:53,538 --> 01:54:55,499
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see what happens with the motions that pass.

1338
01:54:56,319 --> 01:55:07,623
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanna say very simply that I do not think that any union or bargaining unit in the city would go for 23 years without a compensation increase.

1339
01:55:09,485 --> 01:55:11,586
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think anyone would accept that, right?

1340
01:55:12,227 --> 01:55:18,411
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there anyone who would say that's, you know, we'll go for 23 years and then after 23 years we'll come back and we'll ask for 2%.

1341
01:55:18,511 --> 01:55:19,011
[SPEAKER_06]: So, excuse me?

1342
01:55:30,834 --> 01:55:31,975
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, thank you, thank you.

1343
01:55:32,155 --> 01:55:32,996
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna continue now.

1344
01:55:33,876 --> 01:55:38,040
[SPEAKER_06]: So as I was saying, I don't think there's, Mr. McGilvery, if you could just let me speak.

1345
01:55:39,541 --> 01:55:43,765
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think there's anyone in this community who would accept that.

1346
01:55:43,825 --> 01:55:49,909
[SPEAKER_06]: Any union leader, any union member who would say, oh, after 23 years, we'll start at two, we'll start 2% for the next four years.

1347
01:55:50,530 --> 01:55:56,415
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a false equivalence to compare, oh, let's address 23 years of no adjustment to compensation

1348
01:55:57,717 --> 01:56:00,098
[SPEAKER_06]: and say, oh, we're starting down to 23 years, we'll let that go.

1349
01:56:00,638 --> 01:56:02,999
[SPEAKER_06]: Zeroes for 23 years, we'll start 2% now.

1350
01:56:03,899 --> 01:56:04,780
[SPEAKER_06]: No one would accept that.

1351
01:56:04,920 --> 01:56:06,600
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a false equivalence to say that we would.

1352
01:56:06,700 --> 01:56:08,141
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's the only thing I'm gonna say to this.

1353
01:56:08,981 --> 01:56:11,022
[SPEAKER_06]: There's something that has happened for 25 years.

1354
01:56:11,482 --> 01:56:17,524
[SPEAKER_06]: For whatever reason, the council here for 23 years, sorry, never chose to take action on this.

1355
01:56:18,104 --> 01:56:24,647
[SPEAKER_06]: If a mayor held out on a union for 23 years or a school committee held out on a contract for 23 years, I mean, we all know that would never happen.

1356
01:56:25,450 --> 01:56:28,932
[SPEAKER_06]: right, the union would take action to stop that from happening.

1357
01:56:29,612 --> 01:56:31,413
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just want to put that out there.

1358
01:56:31,493 --> 01:56:32,674
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a false equivalency.

1359
01:56:32,694 --> 01:56:40,779
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's the one piece of the discussion tonight that that stuck with me and kind of I didn't feel was a fair representation of the facts.

1360
01:56:40,799 --> 01:56:43,960
[SPEAKER_06]: But beyond that, I appreciate the discussion from everyone tonight.

1361
01:56:44,461 --> 01:56:53,186
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate the further proposals, I think, as the motions have been made to look at longer times of phase in and lesser amounts.

1362
01:56:53,226 --> 01:56:53,626
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll see

1363
01:56:54,036 --> 01:56:55,797
[SPEAKER_06]: those motions are considered going forward.

1364
01:56:56,257 --> 01:56:57,538
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will go now to the podium, Mr. Mayor.

1365
01:56:57,578 --> 01:56:57,998
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1366
01:56:58,018 --> 01:56:59,559
[SPEAKER_13]: Harry McGilvey for Piedmont Road.

1367
01:57:00,480 --> 01:57:00,820
[SPEAKER_13]: You're right.

1368
01:57:00,880 --> 01:57:03,342
[SPEAKER_13]: Nobody would accept 23 years without a pay raise.

1369
01:57:03,362 --> 01:57:04,082
[SPEAKER_13]: You're 100% right.

1370
01:57:04,542 --> 01:57:09,565
[SPEAKER_13]: And I said, there's not a union member probably here that would be against someone getting a pay raise.

1371
01:57:09,845 --> 01:57:12,507
[SPEAKER_13]: But a false equivalency is what you just said.

1372
01:57:12,947 --> 01:57:16,469
[SPEAKER_13]: We work under three-year bargaining, bargain contracts.

1373
01:57:17,030 --> 01:57:20,192
[SPEAKER_13]: The school committee and the city council are not bargaining units.

1374
01:57:21,112 --> 01:57:22,753
[SPEAKER_13]: They don't work under contracts.

1375
01:57:22,773 --> 01:57:24,453
[SPEAKER_13]: There's no collective bargaining here.

1376
01:57:24,954 --> 01:57:30,676
[SPEAKER_13]: You folks run for office at a salary that has been established.

1377
01:57:31,316 --> 01:57:37,639
[SPEAKER_13]: Everybody who puts their hat in the ring, and I give you credit for putting your hat in the ring and seeking public office, I do.

1378
01:57:39,339 --> 01:57:40,800
[SPEAKER_13]: But you know what you're getting into.

1379
01:57:41,380 --> 01:57:47,343
[SPEAKER_13]: And then to get elected after the election is over and the dust settles, it's a bad look.

1380
01:57:48,163 --> 01:57:51,506
[SPEAKER_13]: to then go to the taxpayers and say, we're going to give ourselves a pay raise.

1381
01:57:51,726 --> 01:57:53,147
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we're not going to give ourselves a pay raise.

1382
01:57:53,407 --> 01:57:54,107
[SPEAKER_13]: I understand.

1383
01:57:54,568 --> 01:57:55,108
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's not get.

1384
01:57:56,209 --> 01:58:00,992
[SPEAKER_13]: What I'm trying to say, what we what I think what's trying to what we're trying to say here tonight is.

1385
01:58:02,434 --> 01:58:03,274
[SPEAKER_13]: We're not treated.

1386
01:58:05,956 --> 01:58:13,562
[SPEAKER_13]: We're not treated fairly most of the time during contract negotiations, and it's frustrating to see something like this happen.

1387
01:58:14,608 --> 01:58:20,931
[SPEAKER_13]: You saw the teachers and the firefighters outside this building all last year.

1388
01:58:22,152 --> 01:58:24,133
[SPEAKER_13]: You saw them at different events throughout the city.

1389
01:58:24,533 --> 01:58:27,315
[SPEAKER_13]: We should not have to get to that to get a 2% pay raise.

1390
01:58:33,591 --> 01:58:34,792
[SPEAKER_13]: And everybody works.

1391
01:58:35,753 --> 01:58:36,634
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a fact of life.

1392
01:58:36,734 --> 01:58:38,315
[SPEAKER_13]: Everybody works one, two jobs.

1393
01:58:38,375 --> 01:58:40,537
[SPEAKER_13]: It depends on where you wanna be.

1394
01:58:40,737 --> 01:58:43,820
[SPEAKER_13]: That's gonna gauge how hard you work, okay?

1395
01:58:44,460 --> 01:58:51,426
[SPEAKER_13]: So I appreciate what you were saying, but to say 23 years, we wouldn't stand for that.

1396
01:58:53,488 --> 01:58:57,251
[SPEAKER_13]: We're under collective bargaining agreements that by law go every three years.

1397
01:58:58,746 --> 01:59:11,720
[SPEAKER_13]: Chapter 150E is a very strong union chapter in mass general law for bargaining units, and we appreciate it.

1398
01:59:11,740 --> 01:59:12,340
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1399
01:59:12,801 --> 01:59:13,301
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate it.

1400
01:59:13,321 --> 01:59:14,102
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. McGilvery.

1401
01:59:15,223 --> 01:59:19,768
[SPEAKER_06]: I certainly would not negotiate the way that previous contract negotiations were negotiated.

1402
01:59:24,451 --> 01:59:25,672
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe Councilor Tseng.

1403
01:59:25,952 --> 01:59:26,453
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Tseng.

1404
01:59:26,833 --> 01:59:37,963
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, President Bears, and thank you for all the feedback, for the public participation, even if we don't see eye to eye with the proposals I put forward on the floor.

1405
01:59:40,211 --> 02:00:00,320
[SPEAKER_08]: I do think it's really important to clarify some things for the audience watching, and the audience online as well, which I should note, which is just to clarify the proposal, at least that I put forward on the floor, and to really get a better grasp of it.

1406
02:00:00,780 --> 02:00:02,261
[SPEAKER_08]: So the first thing is,

1407
02:00:03,081 --> 02:00:07,205
[SPEAKER_08]: My proposal follows the rates of the increases over the years.

1408
02:00:07,245 --> 02:00:10,228
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't follow the amount increase over the years.

1409
02:00:10,829 --> 02:00:20,219
[SPEAKER_08]: And because the school committee pay starts at a lower amount, this is actually a smaller total amount than what we would see for the average teacher.

1410
02:00:20,279 --> 02:00:22,581
[SPEAKER_08]: But this is the same percentage rate.

1411
02:00:22,861 --> 02:00:25,684
[SPEAKER_08]: And I keep hearing

1412
02:00:27,517 --> 02:00:36,900
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, maybe it's not about this proposal, but the percentage change figures of things in the hundreds, which is not true.

1413
02:00:37,100 --> 02:00:50,004
[SPEAKER_08]: This proposal that I put forward is a 2.48% annual increase, or a percentage annual increase, which I've heard 3% be standard for some unions.

1414
02:00:50,044 --> 02:00:51,665
[SPEAKER_08]: I've heard other percentages.

1415
02:00:51,785 --> 02:00:55,826
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the MTA, what's standard for the MTA over that period of time, which tracks very,

1416
02:00:56,606 --> 02:00:57,587
[SPEAKER_08]: closely to inflation.

1417
02:00:58,987 --> 02:01:08,392
[SPEAKER_08]: I also took a second to calculate the actual dollar impact of this proposal as well by fiscal 2026.

1418
02:01:11,574 --> 02:01:18,160
[SPEAKER_08]: And so in fiscal 26, the proposal I've laid on the floor will cost taxpayers $35,472.40, which is not that much.

1419
02:01:18,180 --> 02:01:20,201
[SPEAKER_08]: And to be completely clear, we can't fill empty positions at that rate.

1420
02:01:20,221 --> 02:01:22,383
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we should be careful of false equivalencies we're taking.

1421
02:01:39,516 --> 02:01:44,659
[SPEAKER_08]: from some people and giving to others because that's number one, not how the budget works.

1422
02:01:44,699 --> 02:01:47,000
[SPEAKER_08]: And number two, we're talking about $35,472.40.

1423
02:01:48,100 --> 02:02:04,487
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think the conversations that we're having tonight that we've had over the last month really underscores a bigger question of underfunding in the terms of millions.

1424
02:02:05,450 --> 02:02:08,015
[SPEAKER_08]: not thousands of dollars or thousand dollars.

1425
02:02:08,717 --> 02:02:11,843
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to have a conversation about business districts and about

1426
02:02:14,312 --> 02:02:16,993
[SPEAKER_08]: ballot measures and about zoning, right?

1427
02:02:17,033 --> 02:02:19,474
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to have a conversation about those things.

1428
02:02:19,915 --> 02:02:32,481
[SPEAKER_08]: For example, the council recently passed, or the last council passed at the end of the year, a Medford Square ordinance change that would redevelop Medford Square and bring business and investment money in, right?

1429
02:02:32,881 --> 02:02:36,763
[SPEAKER_08]: That's stuff over the longer term that we can use for our schools.

1430
02:02:38,684 --> 02:02:46,148
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's also really important to note that we also can't legally break a contract to give a raise as much as I personally would want to.

1431
02:02:47,289 --> 02:02:53,513
[SPEAKER_08]: And sadly, $35,000 probably doesn't split great over the amount of staff that we have.

1432
02:02:55,714 --> 02:02:59,437
[SPEAKER_08]: I think, you know, to the point that about the living wage.

1433
02:03:00,486 --> 02:03:05,190
[SPEAKER_08]: I am sympathetic to the point from the fellow Councilor.

1434
02:03:05,931 --> 02:03:19,663
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the living wage is an ideal, and I want to be very clear that neither the proposal I've laid out on the floor or the proposal that Councilor Collins has on the floor would make this job necessarily a living wage.

1435
02:03:19,703 --> 02:03:21,985
[SPEAKER_08]: It would just make it more justifiable to take.

1436
02:03:24,699 --> 02:03:28,507
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think it's important to clarify all those points as well.

1437
02:03:31,112 --> 02:03:35,140
[SPEAKER_08]: There's one more point that I wanted to bring up, and it's one point that I'm

1438
02:03:35,771 --> 02:03:39,595
[SPEAKER_08]: particularly sympathetic towards, that of the paraprofessionals.

1439
02:03:40,056 --> 02:03:53,249
[SPEAKER_08]: And the way that we have it phased in would almost definitely ensure in either proposal, given contract negotiations, that school committee members do not make more than the lowest paid paraprofessionals.

1440
02:03:54,671 --> 02:03:57,834
[SPEAKER_08]: I have the paraprofessional salary chart

1441
02:03:58,815 --> 02:03:59,535
[SPEAKER_08]: in front of me.

1442
02:04:00,356 --> 02:04:11,120
[SPEAKER_08]: And if the lowest paid pair of professionals being paid $17,000, then we should definitely have a connect them with human resources, because that is not what the contract says.

1443
02:04:12,001 --> 02:04:12,941
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're being mispaid.

1444
02:04:13,482 --> 02:04:19,344
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we should work on that if that's if that's the case, because the lowest figure I have is $20,500.

1445
02:04:22,040 --> 02:04:27,062
[SPEAKER_08]: um, for for kindergarten needs, which is again definitely way too low.

1446
02:04:27,362 --> 02:04:28,323
[SPEAKER_08]: It's unjustifiable.

1447
02:04:28,943 --> 02:04:44,109
[SPEAKER_08]: But in my opinion, voting for an increase, um, a reasonable increase, a compromise proposal, um, would basically allow us to lift all boats and to give us a reason to lift all boats as well.

1448
02:04:45,210 --> 02:04:45,470
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1449
02:04:45,490 --> 02:04:48,131
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's they're saying Councilor living.

1450
02:04:50,545 --> 02:04:59,974
[SPEAKER_19]: Just first off, I would like to thank MTA President Gehan for bringing up the issue about the paraprofessional receiving disciplinary action.

1451
02:05:00,014 --> 02:05:00,614
[SPEAKER_19]: I know that Ms.

1452
02:05:01,355 --> 02:05:07,982
[SPEAKER_19]: Cherry also commented on it, but any information that you're free to email about that to me, I would very much appreciate just to

1453
02:05:08,542 --> 02:05:10,343
[SPEAKER_19]: learn more about that particular situation.

1454
02:05:10,863 --> 02:05:18,206
[SPEAKER_19]: This is just a broader point that echoes a lot of what's been said.

1455
02:05:19,546 --> 02:05:26,929
[SPEAKER_19]: For a long time Medford's been penny smart and dollar stupid.

1456
02:05:27,489 --> 02:05:28,850
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're talking about

1457
02:05:34,008 --> 02:05:39,390
[SPEAKER_19]: the, when we're talking about the total operating budget of Medford, it's just above about $200 million.

1458
02:05:40,210 --> 02:05:42,871
[SPEAKER_19]: Somerville's is between seven and 800 million.

1459
02:05:42,931 --> 02:05:44,432
[SPEAKER_19]: Cambridge's is about a billion.

1460
02:05:45,092 --> 02:05:59,797
[SPEAKER_19]: If you're considering the sort of per capita operating budget, so the amount of money spent per person in a municipality, Medford's is one of the lowest for a substantially sized city in the state of Massachusetts.

1461
02:06:01,157 --> 02:06:01,557
[SPEAKER_19]: Basically,

1462
02:06:03,618 --> 02:06:18,275
[SPEAKER_19]: We have been trying to cut costs here and there for a very long period of time, and that's the reason that right now we can't pay teachers what they deserve to be paid when we're talking about when we're talking about exchanging.

1463
02:06:18,895 --> 02:06:30,681
[SPEAKER_19]: in the grand scheme of things, relatively small amounts of money here and there when we're talking about cutting staff costs, that can save money in a given fiscal year.

1464
02:06:31,021 --> 02:06:32,902
[SPEAKER_19]: It does not save money in the long term.

1465
02:06:33,082 --> 02:06:41,846
[SPEAKER_19]: We need to start thinking about fiscal responsibility in terms of investing in ourselves in the long term, not saving money in the very short term.

1466
02:06:43,287 --> 02:06:45,068
[SPEAKER_19]: I would, but yes, I,

1467
02:06:46,184 --> 02:06:50,787
[SPEAKER_19]: Once again, I very much sympathize with the teacher's views on this.

1468
02:06:51,388 --> 02:06:55,791
[SPEAKER_19]: The optics are terrible, and I appreciate your presence here tonight.

1469
02:06:56,952 --> 02:06:58,553
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you very much for your time.

1470
02:07:02,676 --> 02:07:04,057
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Lemme.

1471
02:07:08,080 --> 02:07:10,262
[SPEAKER_06]: There is one more hand on Zoom.

1472
02:07:10,722 --> 02:07:11,483
[SPEAKER_06]: I just saw a raise.

1473
02:07:11,543 --> 02:07:14,425
[SPEAKER_06]: I will go to Brianna Martinetti on Zoom.

1474
02:07:19,742 --> 02:07:20,543
[SPEAKER_06]: You should be unmuted.

1475
02:07:20,563 --> 02:07:21,864
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address for the record, please.

1476
02:07:21,904 --> 02:07:23,266
[SPEAKER_06]: And if not, I'll press the button again.

1477
02:07:25,368 --> 02:07:26,369
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to give you a pop-up.

1478
02:07:30,012 --> 02:07:31,434
[SPEAKER_06]: We still can't hear you.

1479
02:07:33,996 --> 02:07:34,637
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me try that again.

1480
02:07:34,657 --> 02:07:36,959
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to press a button, and it should pop up and ask you to unmute.

1481
02:07:46,789 --> 02:07:49,891
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't actually make it unmute you, and I apologize for that.

1482
02:07:50,051 --> 02:07:51,611
[SPEAKER_06]: And maybe it's on the phone.

1483
02:08:04,898 --> 02:08:07,359
[SPEAKER_06]: It should be kind of a dialog box with a blue button in it.

1484
02:08:10,181 --> 02:08:11,081
[SPEAKER_06]: I see you looking for it.

1485
02:08:11,121 --> 02:08:11,942
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really sorry.

1486
02:08:11,962 --> 02:08:14,183
[SPEAKER_06]: If I could just unmute you, I would, but it doesn't let me.

1487
02:08:21,550 --> 02:08:24,085
[SPEAKER_17]: Council President Washington is searching, can I just make a comment?

1488
02:08:24,429 --> 02:08:24,829
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, sure.

1489
02:08:26,370 --> 02:08:27,952
[SPEAKER_17]: There was something that was passed by.

1490
02:08:27,992 --> 02:08:36,818
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think that as a, as a former coach of 32 years, I didn't realize that coaches haven't been paid, haven't got an increase in 20 years as well.

1491
02:08:36,878 --> 02:08:46,685
[SPEAKER_17]: So that might be something that, um, we should remember just for the budget process, because I think all of us realize the importance that they, they play in our lives.

1492
02:08:46,725 --> 02:08:48,166
[SPEAKER_17]: So I know it's great.

1493
02:08:48,186 --> 02:08:52,609
[SPEAKER_17]: A lot of those coaches have been there for 20 years, you know, a coach like Louis Jerry.

1494
02:08:53,544 --> 02:08:54,524
[SPEAKER_06]: But thank you.

1495
02:08:55,024 --> 02:08:55,744
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Skowale.

1496
02:08:55,764 --> 02:08:57,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you wanna do that in the form of a motion or?

1497
02:08:57,525 --> 02:08:57,625
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1498
02:08:59,205 --> 02:08:59,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1499
02:09:03,326 --> 02:09:04,326
[SPEAKER_06]: Here, let's try this one.

1500
02:09:04,346 --> 02:09:06,846
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna ask you to unmute again.

1501
02:09:06,866 --> 02:09:08,347
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go.

1502
02:09:08,607 --> 02:09:09,127
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it working now?

1503
02:09:09,267 --> 02:09:10,727
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you address for the record, please?

1504
02:09:11,287 --> 02:09:15,088
[SPEAKER_26]: Hey, yeah, this is Grant Marnetti, 188 Washington Street in Medford.

1505
02:09:16,628 --> 02:09:19,789
[SPEAKER_26]: I heard, Justin, you had just mentioned that 35,000

1506
02:09:21,889 --> 02:09:23,250
[SPEAKER_26]: was not much for taxpayers.

1507
02:09:24,651 --> 02:09:27,092
[SPEAKER_26]: As a taxpayer, that's really insulting to hear.

1508
02:09:27,992 --> 02:09:39,479
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm going to be honest, like, I don't hold it against renters being here, but to spend someone else's money and just say it so blatant is insulting.

1509
02:09:39,499 --> 02:09:46,062
[SPEAKER_26]: You know, I heard Councilor Scarpelli mention that he was willing to give up some of his pay for that.

1510
02:09:46,502 --> 02:09:48,824
[SPEAKER_26]: I think to put this on a level playing field,

1511
02:09:49,784 --> 02:09:57,189
[SPEAKER_26]: For you to say that, I think you should be willing to pay the average tax and the average rate that Medford citizens pay.

1512
02:09:58,390 --> 02:10:03,273
[SPEAKER_26]: And if you do that, I think it would be a lot easier to sit there and spend my money.

1513
02:10:03,773 --> 02:10:04,594
[SPEAKER_26]: That's all I have to say.

1514
02:10:08,777 --> 02:10:09,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1515
02:10:10,958 --> 02:10:12,679
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other comments from members of the public?

1516
02:10:15,361 --> 02:10:17,843
[SPEAKER_06]: Seeing none, I'm going to review the motions as I have them.

1517
02:10:17,923 --> 02:10:19,464
[SPEAKER_06]: I did try to do some of the math here.

1518
02:10:20,711 --> 02:10:20,812
[SPEAKER_06]: Um

1519
02:10:22,807 --> 02:10:27,809
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a motion from Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Tseng to report the following out of committee.

1520
02:10:27,829 --> 02:10:35,873
[SPEAKER_06]: Be it resolved that the City Council, pursuant to Chapter 7152, set the following rates of compensation effective July 1, 2024.

1521
02:10:35,933 --> 02:10:42,496
[SPEAKER_06]: School committee member $17,052.80, school committee vice chair $17,900, school committee secretary $19,075, school committee chair $18,750.

1522
02:10:51,035 --> 02:10:57,060
[SPEAKER_06]: be it resolved that the Council, pursuant to General Laws, Chapter 71, Section 52, set the following rates for July 1, 2025.

1523
02:10:58,441 --> 02:10:59,241
[SPEAKER_06]: School committee member, 22,105.60.

1524
02:10:59,281 --> 02:11:02,964
[SPEAKER_06]: I will show a chart in a minute, by the way, I know this is a lot of numbers.

1525
02:11:03,004 --> 02:11:03,885
[SPEAKER_06]: School committee vice chair, 23,200.

1526
02:11:03,925 --> 02:11:05,526
[SPEAKER_06]: School committee secretary, 23,750.

1527
02:11:05,566 --> 02:11:06,467
[SPEAKER_06]: School committee chair, 24,300.

1528
02:11:15,046 --> 02:11:23,672
[SPEAKER_06]: be resolved by the City Council that effective July 1 26 school committee members salary 25,732 70 26,920 for the vice chair, 27,775 for the secretary, 28 4 25 for the chair and then July 1 2027 effective 29 3 59 84 school committee member.

1529
02:11:39,723 --> 02:11:46,545
[SPEAKER_06]: 30,640 for the Vice Chair, 31,760 for the Secretary, and 32,550 for the Chair.

1530
02:11:47,605 --> 02:11:56,069
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a second motion by Councilor Tseng, seconded by Councilor Leming, that would just have incorporated the first two of those, the raises for effective July 1, 2024 and July 1, 2025.

1531
02:11:59,710 --> 02:12:15,938
[SPEAKER_06]: there was a motion to refer the following to the Governance Committee, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that the Governance Committee consider during charter review the inclusion of a mechanism within the updated city charter to trigger automatic COLA increases and or compensation review for all elected positions at regular intervals.

1532
02:12:16,458 --> 02:12:28,964
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there was a motion by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro to report out of committee the following resolution, be it resolved that the Council lower its own rate of pay to the equivalent amount to

1533
02:12:29,810 --> 02:12:33,094
[SPEAKER_06]: to the amount, how do we phrase this, George?

1534
02:12:33,955 --> 02:12:35,477
[SPEAKER_06]: It was to bring the two together?

1535
02:12:37,680 --> 02:12:41,164
[SPEAKER_06]: To a blended salary, that is the difference between, yeah.

1536
02:12:41,544 --> 02:12:42,065
[SPEAKER_06]: Equal pay.

1537
02:12:43,327 --> 02:12:43,747
[SPEAKER_06]: Difference.

1538
02:12:43,767 --> 02:12:44,909
[SPEAKER_06]: It just doesn't matter, Zach.

1539
02:12:46,170 --> 02:12:47,352
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I want to get it right.

1540
02:12:47,412 --> 02:12:48,573
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I appreciate it.

1541
02:12:48,593 --> 02:12:49,194
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate it.

1542
02:12:55,598 --> 02:13:00,341
[SPEAKER_06]: And then to follow the schedule proposed by Councilor Saint for increases in 2024 and 2025.

1543
02:13:00,381 --> 02:13:07,124
[SPEAKER_06]: I tried to put this up here.

1544
02:13:07,444 --> 02:13:11,487
[SPEAKER_06]: If there's a dispute by the people who made the motion, please let me know.

1545
02:13:12,267 --> 02:13:19,711
[SPEAKER_06]: But this is the difference between the proposals.

1546
02:13:20,631 --> 02:13:21,472
[SPEAKER_06]: How is that showing up?

1547
02:13:23,624 --> 02:13:27,427
[SPEAKER_06]: So the current rates effective, it's currently effective 12,000, 13,200, 14,400, 12,600.

1548
02:13:27,587 --> 02:13:33,751
[SPEAKER_06]: The initial proposal that was proposed on December 12th would have, on January 1, 2024, increased the rates to 29,359.80, 3,000 would increase to these numbers.

1549
02:13:33,791 --> 02:13:35,312
[SPEAKER_06]: The proposal by Councilor Tseng would, on July 1, 2024,

1550
02:13:53,686 --> 02:13:54,947
[SPEAKER_06]: increase the amounts to this.

1551
02:13:56,788 --> 02:13:59,329
[SPEAKER_06]: On July 1, 2025, increase the amounts to this.

1552
02:14:00,089 --> 02:14:08,053
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the proposal by Councilor Collins has the same for the first two years with a further increase July 1, 2026 and July 1, 2027.

1553
02:14:09,293 --> 02:14:19,678
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's the difference between the current amount, the initial proposal and the two proposals on the floor from Councilor Tseng and Councilor Collins.

1554
02:14:21,539 --> 02:14:22,800
[SPEAKER_06]: And if I did the math wrong, please

1555
02:14:24,448 --> 02:14:24,795
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me know.

1556
02:15:03,387 --> 02:15:05,409
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, is there any discussion on the motions?

1557
02:15:06,770 --> 02:15:07,611
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Collins.

1558
02:15:09,933 --> 02:15:10,793
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, President Bears.

1559
02:15:10,833 --> 02:15:14,597
[SPEAKER_23]: I appreciate you putting this into a visual format on the fly.

1560
02:15:14,617 --> 02:15:23,724
[SPEAKER_23]: I think at this point in the discussion, we've all spoken and heard and listened.

1561
02:15:23,745 --> 02:15:25,186
[SPEAKER_23]: There's a couple ideas out on the floor.

1562
02:15:27,773 --> 02:15:30,495
[SPEAKER_23]: personally, I think it's time to move the question.

1563
02:15:30,755 --> 02:15:51,350
[SPEAKER_23]: I think that in the intervening days between this goes on, the regular meeting agenda will pay time for us to reflect and absorb what we've discussed together, what we've heard from the public, and to think about path forward that makes sense now that we have some alternative proposals for us to vote on providing different ways forward.

1564
02:15:55,686 --> 02:15:58,252
[SPEAKER_23]: Sorry for my halting language, I'm like a nurse.

1565
02:15:59,595 --> 02:16:04,305
[SPEAKER_23]: I want to again reiterate, you know, I'll probably say this the next time this comes up as well.

1566
02:16:07,730 --> 02:16:09,211
[SPEAKER_23]: I do what I have the jurisdiction to do.

1567
02:16:09,371 --> 02:16:21,776
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, last year, a couple times, we were given the opportunity to vote on cost of living adjustment increases to non-union personnel while there were still unions being negotiated, while there were still union contracts being negotiated.

1568
02:16:22,516 --> 02:16:23,917
[SPEAKER_23]: And that was a discussion, which makes sense.

1569
02:16:23,937 --> 02:16:26,718
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm glad that it was, and it was brought up for an understandable reason.

1570
02:16:28,318 --> 02:16:32,879
[SPEAKER_23]: And I voted yes, because when I have the opportunity to vote yes on a raise, I'll vote yes on a raise.

1571
02:16:33,699 --> 02:16:39,821
[SPEAKER_23]: And I intend to do that here, depending on what my fellow Councilors support and what we decide that the best path forward is.

1572
02:16:40,841 --> 02:16:49,283
[SPEAKER_23]: If we had the jurisdiction to vote on raises for teachers and paras and custodians and other public servants, I would do that, but I don't.

1573
02:16:49,823 --> 02:16:53,644
[SPEAKER_23]: I'll vote for the raises that I have the opportunity to support.

1574
02:16:54,644 --> 02:17:06,998
[SPEAKER_23]: Um, and I just want to note also for folks here and folks watching, um, you know, if there are people here who don't usually attend our meetings, which, you know, I know sometimes people come to some meetings and others, it's super normal.

1575
02:17:07,639 --> 02:17:10,762
[SPEAKER_23]: Um, this is a really unusual topic for a city council meeting.

1576
02:17:12,176 --> 02:17:16,019
[SPEAKER_23]: We, a lot of issues were brought up that are more of what we talked about all the time.

1577
02:17:17,460 --> 02:17:33,331
[SPEAKER_23]: They can store fronts, the need for commercial development the need for business development, the need to reevaluate our zoning and our housing, and all the other things that are really what we interface with as residents on a day to day basis that is the bread and butter of the city council, and that all directly feeds into.

1578
02:17:34,671 --> 02:17:39,674
[SPEAKER_23]: the bottom line budget that affects how much we can appropriate to the schools for the schools to then appropriate.

1579
02:17:40,034 --> 02:17:42,896
[SPEAKER_23]: Once it enters the schools, we don't touch it, except for this.

1580
02:17:44,517 --> 02:17:58,985
[SPEAKER_23]: And I just also want to, while reemphasizing the validity of everything that's been said today, I believe that that work that takes up most of our time on this council exceeds by magnitudes in terms of what we can

1581
02:18:00,902 --> 02:18:06,788
[SPEAKER_23]: do in terms of revenue and support that feeds into necessary services in the schools and elsewhere throughout this community.

1582
02:18:08,516 --> 02:18:16,179
[SPEAKER_23]: it is more impactful than what will be at maximum, a 0.05% increase over as much as four years.

1583
02:18:16,199 --> 02:18:37,148
[SPEAKER_23]: And I don't say that to minimize the issue, the values behind the discussion are really important, but just to frame it in the larger discussion of what this council is trying to do all year long during budget season, creating more mechanisms and ordinances to bring more clarity and reality and long-term planning to our budget process, working on our commercial tax base through zoning and licensing and business development.

1584
02:18:38,448 --> 02:18:47,070
[SPEAKER_23]: That is all part and parcel of this work, and it is, in terms of dollars, more impactful.

1585
02:18:48,791 --> 02:18:52,212
[SPEAKER_23]: With that, I would move the question to vote on these proposals tonight.

1586
02:18:52,332 --> 02:18:52,632
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

1587
02:18:53,692 --> 02:18:54,373
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

1588
02:18:54,393 --> 02:18:55,193
[SPEAKER_06]: Any further discussion?

1589
02:18:58,434 --> 02:18:59,114
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Callahan.

1590
02:18:59,947 --> 02:19:13,738
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm a little bothered by the fact that it looks like in both of these proposals, the final landing pay is more than the lowest paid paraprofessional that I don't feel, unless I'm incorrect about that, that's what it looked like to me.

1591
02:19:15,319 --> 02:19:25,967
[SPEAKER_16]: I won't be voting in favor of anything that puts them above a full-time paraprofessional.

1592
02:19:25,987 --> 02:19:28,028
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I don't have those contracts in front of me.

1593
02:19:32,093 --> 02:19:33,554
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Tseng?

1594
02:19:33,574 --> 02:19:46,185
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have the contract for FY25 in front of me, but that would not be true at least for this upcoming year.

1595
02:19:47,446 --> 02:19:54,452
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's difficult to project out in the future because there's a contract negotiation.

1596
02:19:54,772 --> 02:19:56,814
[SPEAKER_08]: A new contract has to be agreed on in six months.

1597
02:19:59,858 --> 02:20:03,879
[SPEAKER_08]: which is partially why I proposed that phase-in.

1598
02:20:03,899 --> 02:20:06,420
[SPEAKER_08]: So instead of, the original proposal was to start immediately.

1599
02:20:07,860 --> 02:20:16,763
[SPEAKER_08]: This proposal builds in time for us to review all those contracts, to review the budget before we actually send out the money.

1600
02:20:21,513 --> 02:20:21,853
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1601
02:20:21,873 --> 02:20:46,903
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, seeing no further discussion on the motion to report out of committee to the regular meeting agenda, Councilor Collins' motion, which is the four-year phase-in, with the first two years being based on the COLA changes for the MTA contract, and the second two bringing it to parity with the Council.

1602
02:20:47,907 --> 02:20:49,067
[SPEAKER_06]: seconded by Councilor Sagan.

1603
02:20:49,087 --> 02:20:50,448
[SPEAKER_06]: This is to refer to the regular meeting.

1604
02:20:50,488 --> 02:20:55,870
[SPEAKER_06]: The process from here on out, items will be, go to the regular meeting agenda.

1605
02:20:55,890 --> 02:20:58,071
[SPEAKER_06]: The final votes will happen on the regular meeting agenda.

1606
02:20:58,131 --> 02:21:00,212
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're just reporting items out of committee.

1607
02:21:00,252 --> 02:21:04,753
[SPEAKER_06]: If multiple items are reported out, multiple items will be considered on the regular meeting agenda.

1608
02:21:05,234 --> 02:21:07,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Since these are separate motions, they'll be considered separately.

1609
02:21:07,394 --> 02:21:08,835
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is not the final vote.

1610
02:21:09,235 --> 02:21:14,097
[SPEAKER_06]: This is just a vote to report items out of committee to our regular meeting agenda.

1611
02:21:15,307 --> 02:21:21,011
[SPEAKER_06]: So on the motion, Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Tseng, this is the first motion.

1612
02:21:21,051 --> 02:21:22,252
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1613
02:21:32,160 --> 02:21:37,704
[SPEAKER_16]: This is to put this to the next meeting.

1614
02:21:37,884 --> 02:21:39,666
[SPEAKER_06]: This is to move this to the regular meeting.

1615
02:21:39,686 --> 02:21:42,108
[SPEAKER_06]: The final vote will be taken at the regular meeting.

1616
02:21:42,288 --> 02:21:42,428
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1617
02:21:44,551 --> 02:21:44,711
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1618
02:21:44,771 --> 02:21:45,092
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1619
