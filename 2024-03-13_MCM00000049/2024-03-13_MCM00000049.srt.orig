[SPEAKER_18]: We've received some notifications from the Lawrence Memorial Hospital, the Department of Public Health at the state level relative to the proceedings at the site.

33
00:02:01,028 --> 00:02:05,030
[SPEAKER_18]: At this point, I'd like to turn the floor over to representatives from the Lawrence Memorial Hospital to update us on the progress.

34
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:06,731
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Counselor Knight.

35
00:02:12,914 --> 00:02:15,155
[SPEAKER_16]: If we could have your name and address for the record, please.

36
00:02:31,045 --> 00:02:33,487
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Blake, could you shut that off, please?

37
00:02:33,587 --> 00:02:37,289
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure the glare is bad enough without that.

38
00:02:59,243 --> 00:03:00,944
[SPEAKER_16]: If we could have you name and address for the record, please.

39
00:03:01,325 --> 00:03:01,505
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

40
00:03:02,545 --> 00:03:07,309
[SPEAKER_14]: Ryan Fuller representing Lawrence Memorial Hospital, 170 Governor's Ave, Medford, Massachusetts.

41
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:07,769
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

42
00:03:09,991 --> 00:03:10,411
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening.

43
00:03:10,451 --> 00:03:16,456
[SPEAKER_14]: My name is Ryan Fuller and I'm the vice president of strategy and business planning for Lawrence Memorial Hospital in Melrose Bayfield Healthcare.

44
00:03:17,036 --> 00:03:22,180
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm pleased to come before the city council tonight to provide an update on LMH activity since we last presented to you.

45
00:03:23,241 --> 00:03:23,781
[SPEAKER_14]: Since that time,

46
00:03:24,711 --> 00:03:30,775
[SPEAKER_14]: We continue to work with city leaders and department heads on the particulars of the site and permitting process related to the ambulatory surgery center.

47
00:03:31,895 --> 00:03:40,641
[SPEAKER_14]: We are working with our architects and construction teams related to the specifics around building construction in preparation for the permitting process.

48
00:03:41,141 --> 00:03:50,667
[SPEAKER_14]: And in response to neighborhood questions and concerns about the project, city department head feedback and escalating construction costs and other impacts of the extended project timeline.

49
00:03:52,335 --> 00:04:07,659
[SPEAKER_14]: We recently hosted a meeting with neighbors specifically about their comments and concerns, which you will hear about later, around safety, the existing cut through between Holmes Road and the LMH campus, and the potential of new noise as a result of the proposed ASC.

50
00:04:08,659 --> 00:04:12,300
[SPEAKER_14]: Many of these issues were raised following our update at last month's city council meeting.

51
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:22,002
[SPEAKER_14]: A representative from the nursing home was also present at that meeting, which proved to be helpful in identifying opportunities to address neighborhood concerns specific to the nursing home.

52
00:04:23,017 --> 00:04:27,822
[SPEAKER_14]: It was also an opportunity for newly engaged community members to ask their questions about site selection.

53
00:04:29,104 --> 00:04:37,413
[SPEAKER_14]: While we have been sharing information about site selection since November, it highlighted for us the need for further forms about the hows and whys of site selection.

54
00:04:38,073 --> 00:04:41,677
[SPEAKER_14]: So we are planning a follow-up meeting to focus on this specifically in the immediate future.

55
00:04:43,339 --> 00:04:44,000
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, cold.

56
00:04:45,501 --> 00:04:45,961
[SPEAKER_14]: Next steps.

57
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:53,926
[SPEAKER_14]: As we continue to look forward, our next steps, we are working on the completion of the full permitting package for the city.

58
00:04:54,747 --> 00:05:07,374
[SPEAKER_14]: Our plan is in the next three to four weeks to work with the teams to respond to the items described previously related to city department feedback, change in cost, and community concerns.

59
00:05:08,931 --> 00:05:12,857
[SPEAKER_14]: We need to address those issues before we can move forward with the full permitting package.

60
00:05:14,118 --> 00:05:23,732
[SPEAKER_14]: Once we address those issues and come up with the right solutions, we will then be submitting a full permitting package, which will be submitted to the city and include full traffic and parking study for peer review.

61
00:05:23,752 --> 00:05:25,575
[SPEAKER_14]: We need to address the bigger issues.

62
00:05:30,923 --> 00:05:39,024
[SPEAKER_14]: On another matter, as you know, we've been executing on the notification process required by the Department of Public Health for the emergency department closure at LMH.

63
00:05:39,785 --> 00:05:45,146
[SPEAKER_14]: Transition planning to extend urgent care continues with notifications made to appropriate state and local departments.

64
00:05:45,966 --> 00:05:50,487
[SPEAKER_14]: We have shared with you our comments received from DPH as well as our planning and communication filing.

65
00:05:51,107 --> 00:05:58,168
[SPEAKER_14]: We continue to work towards the March 7, 2009 closure date, the same date as which the new extended urgent care hours go into effect.

66
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:03,707
[SPEAKER_14]: In conclusion, we continue to be excited about the future vision of LMH.

67
00:06:03,927 --> 00:06:15,297
[SPEAKER_14]: As Mr. Bill Lawrence said in our last update to city council, Lawrence Memorial Hospital was created due to change, and these changes were necessary to ensure we continue to deliver high quality health care in Medford for many generations to come.

68
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:21,983
[SPEAKER_14]: We look forward to coming back before the city council in the near future to continue to provide you and the community updates on our progress.

69
00:06:22,324 --> 00:06:22,584
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

70
00:06:24,806 --> 00:06:25,106
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

71
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:30,022
[SPEAKER_16]: Any questions from the Council?

72
00:06:37,328 --> 00:06:37,948
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Marks.

73
00:06:39,269 --> 00:06:42,292
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, maybe if the gentleman could just give us an update.

74
00:06:42,412 --> 00:06:52,900
[SPEAKER_11]: I know we just received a response from Melrose-Wakefield in the DPH letter that they sent out.

75
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:56,512
[SPEAKER_11]: regarding the closure of the emergency room.

76
00:06:57,093 --> 00:07:00,435
[SPEAKER_11]: If you can just give us a brief update on where that stands right now.

77
00:07:01,596 --> 00:07:01,956
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, sir.

78
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:04,938
[SPEAKER_14]: And Lori Halley, if I missed anything, please, please jump in.

79
00:07:05,739 --> 00:07:12,944
[SPEAKER_14]: But we're DPH has asked a couple of additional questions to our plan, which our CMO is responding to.

80
00:07:13,424 --> 00:07:17,527
[SPEAKER_14]: It was around how patients will know and how they get to the other E.D.s.

81
00:07:18,108 --> 00:07:21,030
[SPEAKER_14]: And our CMO is to the other E.D.s in the area.

82
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,751
[SPEAKER_14]: And we've talked to all the other

83
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:26,811
[SPEAKER_14]: emergency departments in the area who can handle the capacity from RED.

84
00:07:27,191 --> 00:07:31,533
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's really a clarification that's going back to DPH, and we're submitting that response back this week.

85
00:07:34,774 --> 00:07:36,034
[SPEAKER_11]: So I had a question.

86
00:07:36,054 --> 00:07:45,337
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure if you're able to answer it or not, but I had the opportunity to read through the response submitted by your organization.

87
00:07:46,351 --> 00:07:49,753
[SPEAKER_11]: And I had just a question regarding travel times.

88
00:07:50,734 --> 00:08:07,444
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is a response back to DPH, letting them know that when and if and when LMH does close its emergency room, that there are alternative plans, meaning other emergency departments in the area.

89
00:08:08,324 --> 00:08:15,309
[SPEAKER_11]: And the report that I viewed mentioned about Armstrong Ambulance Service

90
00:08:16,113 --> 00:08:19,096
[SPEAKER_11]: and the times it takes to get to different facilities.

91
00:08:19,716 --> 00:08:27,262
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you know what percentage of emergency room visits based on actual ambulance service?

92
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:37,750
[SPEAKER_14]: I do not, but happy to provide that, get back to the city council with that information.

93
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:38,411
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

94
00:08:39,376 --> 00:08:51,963
[SPEAKER_11]: I would assume the information that was in the report regarding travel times that the data was obtained from Armstrong Ambulance only included

95
00:08:52,528 --> 00:08:55,329
[SPEAKER_11]: the ambulance at these particular locations.

96
00:08:55,489 --> 00:08:55,909
[SPEAKER_11]: That's correct.

97
00:08:56,369 --> 00:09:14,136
[SPEAKER_11]: So when they say that the drive time for Method residents to Melrose Wakefield Hospital is seven to 10 minutes, I assume that's in an ambulance that's going full-blown sirens, breaking many rules and regulations, getting to a hospital.

98
00:09:15,656 --> 00:09:16,217
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that correct?

99
00:09:16,277 --> 00:09:19,398
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you know the specifics of that?

100
00:09:22,407 --> 00:09:24,427
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you know if it's licensed irons or ALS?

101
00:09:26,348 --> 00:09:26,988
[SPEAKER_25]: If I may?

102
00:09:27,788 --> 00:09:27,948
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

103
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,088
[SPEAKER_25]: Name and address for the record, please.

104
00:09:30,168 --> 00:09:34,349
[SPEAKER_25]: Laurie Howley on behalf of Lawrence Memorial Hospital, 170 Governor's Ave in Medford.

105
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:37,830
[SPEAKER_25]: Let us get clarification on that question.

106
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,350
[SPEAKER_25]: That was data specific.

107
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:47,412
[SPEAKER_25]: So Armstrong Ambulance is the 911 provider for Medford, so they do track all of that data specifically.

108
00:09:48,112 --> 00:09:48,652
[SPEAKER_25]: They can also

109
00:09:49,265 --> 00:09:55,408
[SPEAKER_25]: likely provide us what percentage of ER visits come through by ambulance.

110
00:09:55,888 --> 00:09:59,289
[SPEAKER_25]: So, we're happy to go back and bring that information forward.

111
00:09:59,569 --> 00:09:59,729
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

112
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:10,033
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's important that, and I'm sure DPH will do their own homework, the Department of Public Health, but it's important to know how these figures were arrived at.

113
00:10:10,774 --> 00:10:13,635
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, not everyone arrives at an ambulance

114
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:16,666
[SPEAKER_11]: ambulatory setting by ambulance.

115
00:10:17,486 --> 00:10:31,295
[SPEAKER_11]: And anyone traversing this community knows that it could take you 10 to 15 minutes just to get from, you know, Wellington to Meffitt Square, let alone West Meffitt, which might be another 10 minutes.

116
00:10:32,296 --> 00:10:42,463
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think these particular travel times are concerning for me as a resident and someone that potentially could need emergency service

117
00:10:42,955 --> 00:10:49,299
[SPEAKER_11]: to know the distances between alternatives when we had an emergency service right in our own backyard.

118
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:50,860
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's the first point.

119
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:56,323
[SPEAKER_11]: The second point is based on just the annual emergency room data.

120
00:10:57,164 --> 00:11:10,011
[SPEAKER_11]: And I've stated this publicly a number of times regarding the closure of the emergency room, that the statistics will bear out and the statistics that were provided show from 2016 to 2019,

121
00:11:13,178 --> 00:11:23,601
[SPEAKER_11]: with 2019 being annualized, because it's not a full fiscal year, but it does show the volume in emergency visits to Lawrence Memorial dramatically decreasing.

122
00:11:24,341 --> 00:11:25,181
[SPEAKER_11]: For instance, 2016, it was 12,514 visits.

123
00:11:25,241 --> 00:11:25,321
[SPEAKER_11]: 2017 was 11,925.

124
00:11:25,361 --> 00:11:25,621
[SPEAKER_11]: 2018 was 9,289.

125
00:11:25,761 --> 00:11:27,382
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you annualize 2019,

126
00:11:41,157 --> 00:11:45,139
[SPEAKER_11]: we're looking at about 7,520 emergency room visits.

127
00:11:45,699 --> 00:11:47,220
[SPEAKER_11]: So you can see there's been a decline.

128
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:54,784
[SPEAKER_11]: But as I stated on many occasions, the decline is not due to the services that the hospital is offering.

129
00:11:55,184 --> 00:12:05,769
[SPEAKER_11]: For many years, that hospital emergency room was a robust emergency room and provided great service to residents and people that lived in surrounding communities as well.

130
00:12:06,329 --> 00:12:08,130
[SPEAKER_11]: But if you look back over the years,

131
00:12:09,082 --> 00:12:35,917
[SPEAKER_11]: And for instance, in 2014, when the Health Policy Commission reviewed Partners Healthcare Systems' proposed acquisition of Hallmark Health, they mentioned, and this is September 2014, that Hallmark Lawrence Memorial Hospital would become a 30 to 40 bed facility for ambulatory care and short stay inpatient care lasting three days or fewer.

132
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:38,276
[SPEAKER_11]: operated under the MGH license.

133
00:12:38,816 --> 00:12:40,336
[SPEAKER_11]: We know that never came to fruition.

134
00:12:41,516 --> 00:13:01,762
[SPEAKER_11]: It also goes on to say Hallmark LMH would have an urgent care center, certain expanded outpatient services, and Parton is also committed to keeping LMH emergencies department open during at least the transition period of LMH's conversion, which they estimated take two or three years.

135
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:03,483
[SPEAKER_11]: So as far back as 2014,

136
00:13:05,515 --> 00:13:10,017
[SPEAKER_11]: which are prior to the numbers I just gave regarding volume.

137
00:13:10,857 --> 00:13:22,641
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, there has been the word out there either was partners or Hallmark that there was a steady move to close the ambulatory care at Lawrence Memorial.

138
00:13:24,141 --> 00:13:30,203
[SPEAKER_11]: And there was decisions made by the hospital to go in a different direction.

139
00:13:31,684 --> 00:13:34,445
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think what we saw was services over the years,

140
00:13:35,618 --> 00:13:39,741
[SPEAKER_11]: somehow start to filter over to Melrose Wakefield Hospital.

141
00:13:40,581 --> 00:13:47,626
[SPEAKER_11]: And the decline was not because of a lack of service within our community or a lack of need.

142
00:13:48,326 --> 00:13:59,013
[SPEAKER_11]: It was because of an administrative decision that was made to cut out ambulatory service or surgical ER service within our community.

143
00:13:59,894 --> 00:14:01,535
[SPEAKER_11]: And that same article went on to say,

144
00:14:01,978 --> 00:14:07,823
[SPEAKER_11]: Hallmark Melrose Wakefield would remain an acute care hospital under the Hallmark license.

145
00:14:08,584 --> 00:14:17,512
[SPEAKER_11]: The hospital received an estimated $152 million worth of substantial renovation, including expansion capacity of their ER.

146
00:14:17,532 --> 00:14:25,418
[SPEAKER_11]: 2015 Method Lawrence Memorial Hospital would likely close if Hallmark Health merger fails.

147
00:14:26,359 --> 00:14:27,941
[SPEAKER_11]: And it goes on to say, in its August 2014

148
00:14:29,936 --> 00:14:51,589
[SPEAKER_11]: letter to the Health Policy Commission, Hallmark said it faced significant financial challenges and had implemented significant cost-saving initiatives in fiscal 2014 after seeing a 23% decline in patient discharges at LMH and Melrose-Wakefield Hospital over the previous two years.

149
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:58,073
[SPEAKER_11]: So it wasn't just LMH that was supposedly losing emergency business.

150
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:02,760
[SPEAKER_11]: It was also Melrose-Wakefield, according to this particular article.

151
00:15:06,022 --> 00:15:16,209
[SPEAKER_11]: In 2016, Hallmark Health nears merger with Tufts Medical Center, parent company Wellforce.

152
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:27,557
[SPEAKER_11]: And in 2016, it says Hallmark Health, which owns Medford Lawrence Memorial Hospital, Melrose-Wakefield Hospital, Melrose, and a handful of smaller sites around greater Boston represents

153
00:15:28,582 --> 00:15:29,863
[SPEAKER_11]: 295 million in revenue.

154
00:15:31,203 --> 00:15:39,186
[SPEAKER_11]: The details of the Hallmark's merger with Welforce have not been finalized, but will likely include capital investment at Hallmark facilities.

155
00:15:39,946 --> 00:15:48,730
[SPEAKER_11]: Hallmark officials hope to build a new emergency care wing at Melrose Wakefield Hospital that is at least three times the size of the current ER.

156
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:57,613
[SPEAKER_11]: So as you can see, there's a pattern over the years of taking from Lawrence Memorial and adding to Melrose Wakefield.

157
00:15:58,335 --> 00:16:09,019
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think it's very disingenuous when we're showing DPHR numbers, strictly numbers saying, hey look, it doesn't appear that Method can support an emergency room.

158
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:14,982
[SPEAKER_11]: From a financial standpoint, as a hospital, we can't afford it anymore to have an emergency room in Method.

159
00:16:15,742 --> 00:16:27,547
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think it's disingenuous to state that when clearly there was an administrative decision over many years to close the emergency room.

160
00:16:28,007 --> 00:16:35,074
[SPEAKER_11]: at Lawrence Memorial, a thriving emergency room, and come out with an outpatient clinic that we're talking about now.

161
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:43,723
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just want to state that publicly and go on record that I don't think it was any lack of demand in this community.

162
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:46,986
[SPEAKER_11]: I still believe there's a strong need for emergency room.

163
00:16:47,426 --> 00:16:49,809
[SPEAKER_11]: We have one of the highest percentages

164
00:16:50,232 --> 00:16:53,835
[SPEAKER_11]: of seniors in the Commonwealth living in the city of Method.

165
00:16:54,535 --> 00:16:59,499
[SPEAKER_11]: And as you know, an emergency room is very important, not just to seniors, but to all residents.

166
00:17:00,299 --> 00:17:04,682
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is going to have a real dramatic impact on our community.

167
00:17:05,443 --> 00:17:14,729
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm hoping still there's some hope with DPH that they will deny the closure of your request for closure of Lawrence Memorial Hospital.

168
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:18,472
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we can discuss other options about what's going to happen

169
00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:29,887
[SPEAKER_11]: internally within the hospital, about other outpatient services, and also look at the proposal that you're offering regarding an ambulatory care.

170
00:17:30,247 --> 00:17:35,991
[SPEAKER_11]: But I just want the record to reflect the numbers that were mentioned in your report, as well as the drive times.

171
00:17:36,051 --> 00:17:40,215
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's important to clarify the drive times also to these other emergency rooms.

172
00:17:43,697 --> 00:17:44,418
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

173
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:45,338
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Counselor Marks.

174
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:47,640
[SPEAKER_16]: Counselor Lungo Kern.

175
00:17:49,133 --> 00:17:49,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

176
00:17:49,593 --> 00:17:53,555
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to thank Council Marks for his comments and for the research that he did.

177
00:17:53,595 --> 00:17:54,755
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate them.

178
00:17:57,256 --> 00:18:04,418
[SPEAKER_03]: With regards to, I know the last couple of weeks there's been no release of the traffic and parking study.

179
00:18:04,578 --> 00:18:06,439
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just wanted to ask about a time frame on that.

180
00:18:07,579 --> 00:18:14,402
[SPEAKER_03]: As I think, I mean, for me, one of the biggest issues is the parking.

181
00:18:14,442 --> 00:18:15,442
[SPEAKER_03]: I have an issue with traffic.

182
00:18:17,273 --> 00:18:19,714
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know a lot of people are worried about a garage.

183
00:18:19,754 --> 00:18:22,614
[SPEAKER_03]: I got emails on that today that people don't want to see.

184
00:18:22,934 --> 00:18:29,256
[SPEAKER_03]: The neighborhood does not want to see a garage, yet the parking plan doesn't seem adequate when I look at it.

185
00:18:30,236 --> 00:18:34,697
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really would like somebody from the city to do an independent review of it when it is released.

186
00:18:36,577 --> 00:18:37,518
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you for that question.

187
00:18:39,558 --> 00:18:50,761
[SPEAKER_14]: The study that was done by our civil engineering firm, the experts, VHB, will be submitted and done as a peer review that will look at the parking and traffic study on that.

188
00:18:51,521 --> 00:19:04,005
[SPEAKER_14]: I cannot give specific on dates on when that will be done because we're addressing some of the other issues that I talked about previously as it relates to escalating construction costs, the concerns of the neighbors who you'll hear from later.

189
00:19:04,629 --> 00:19:06,050
[SPEAKER_14]: and some of the department head feedback.

190
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:14,797
[SPEAKER_14]: Once we finalize those, because it may impact the parking study, we will then submit our parking study for a full peer review.

191
00:19:16,378 --> 00:19:21,422
[SPEAKER_03]: So do you expect to submit the parking study at the same time you submit the permitting package to the city?

192
00:19:21,722 --> 00:19:27,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Or are you going to give time for the peer review before you submit your package?

193
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:34,012
[SPEAKER_14]: It is my understanding, normal course is that it happens at submission, submission of the permitting package.

194
00:19:35,128 --> 00:19:37,750
[SPEAKER_14]: That is the normal standard, as it's been explained to me.

195
00:19:39,651 --> 00:19:44,294
[SPEAKER_03]: In your time frame for submitting permitting packages?

196
00:19:44,314 --> 00:19:50,378
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to be able to provide updates on specific dates for that.

197
00:19:50,639 --> 00:19:57,984
[SPEAKER_14]: What I can commit to is that we'll come back and update you on progress we've made to those other issues, mitigating issues on the project.

198
00:19:58,604 --> 00:20:04,248
[SPEAKER_14]: And as we work through those, as we understand and learn, we'll give a more detailed time frame on the permitting.

199
00:20:04,965 --> 00:20:05,466
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to.

200
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:07,128
[SPEAKER_14]: We're committed to moving this project forward.

201
00:20:07,148 --> 00:20:08,189
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to be able to give dates.

202
00:20:08,209 --> 00:20:08,910
[SPEAKER_14]: I just can't yet.

203
00:20:11,693 --> 00:20:13,695
[SPEAKER_14]: As soon as they become clear, I will let everybody know.

204
00:20:13,896 --> 00:20:24,528
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's clear that you want to start construction sometime in the summer, so we can assume that the package should be submitted sometime in the spring?

205
00:20:25,897 --> 00:20:26,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you can't skip?

206
00:20:26,978 --> 00:20:28,179
[SPEAKER_14]: I cannot say that either yet.

207
00:20:28,199 --> 00:20:29,080
[SPEAKER_14]: I apologize.

208
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:32,402
[SPEAKER_14]: It is not because I'm not trying to be coy.

209
00:20:32,623 --> 00:20:40,009
[SPEAKER_14]: We have to address the issues that our neighbors have raised, escalation in cost because of the extended time of the project, and also department head feedback.

210
00:20:40,029 --> 00:20:41,130
[SPEAKER_14]: OK.

211
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:46,994
[SPEAKER_03]: And with regards to the neighborhood concerns, I know we've been trying to address a lot of the concerns.

212
00:20:47,034 --> 00:20:53,820
[SPEAKER_03]: But with regards to especially the direct abutters, I thank you for having that meeting and allowing direct abutters to speak.

213
00:20:54,602 --> 00:21:03,909
[SPEAKER_03]: last week or the week before, when will there be a follow-up meeting with regards to those questions and concerns, and how are they being addressed?

214
00:21:04,849 --> 00:21:05,010
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep.

215
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:12,895
[SPEAKER_14]: So one of the specific meetings we'll have with our abutters is explaining the hows and whys of site selection.

216
00:21:13,676 --> 00:21:15,717
[SPEAKER_14]: So we feel very confident in that criteria.

217
00:21:16,298 --> 00:21:20,481
[SPEAKER_14]: But as we work through our other mitigating factors, the project may change.

218
00:21:20,681 --> 00:21:23,503
[SPEAKER_14]: So we want to handle that so we can then provide more information.

219
00:21:24,062 --> 00:21:33,847
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm happy to talk about our criteria with the abutters, but until we finalize the specifics of the project in case it changes, it wouldn't be a good use of everyone's time.

220
00:21:34,628 --> 00:21:37,389
[SPEAKER_14]: But we're committed to meeting with them, continuing to talk with them.

221
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:44,193
[SPEAKER_14]: We're looking in the three to four week timeframe, but open lines of communication with the direct abutters.

222
00:21:44,713 --> 00:21:51,677
[SPEAKER_14]: We have a community advisory group meeting scheduled in the next week and a half, which includes three direct abutters.

223
00:21:54,091 --> 00:22:03,154
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are my two concerns, the parking and the concerns of the neighborhood and the direct abutters, that they be addressed before any type of permit is requested by the city council.

224
00:22:03,634 --> 00:22:03,934
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

225
00:22:04,815 --> 00:22:06,175
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Vice President Alongo-Kern.

226
00:22:06,835 --> 00:22:07,736
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Carviello.

227
00:22:08,176 --> 00:22:08,876
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

228
00:22:09,816 --> 00:22:12,977
[SPEAKER_09]: In reviewing your list of the health care providers here, you've got some things here.

229
00:22:13,418 --> 00:22:18,859
[SPEAKER_09]: Is Harvard Vanguard Urgent Care, is that open to the public or just to Harvard Vanguard people?

230
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,161
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe it's just Harvard Vanguard patients.

231
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:27,252
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, and the same thing with the Tufts... I don't work for HR, so I can't say that.

232
00:22:27,332 --> 00:22:28,753
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, but... I think so.

233
00:22:30,174 --> 00:22:46,504
[SPEAKER_09]: And you've got Tufts University for the students of Tufts and the Tufts... I think maybe you should specify when you do your list that some of these places are specifically for, let's say, Harvard-Vancouver insurance people and Tufts students.

234
00:22:46,904 --> 00:22:51,127
[SPEAKER_09]: And there is probably another couple of urgent care facilities that you left out.

235
00:22:51,147 --> 00:22:51,787
[SPEAKER_09]: There's the Iona.

236
00:22:53,075 --> 00:22:54,016
[SPEAKER_09]: on Middlesex Avenue.

237
00:22:55,157 --> 00:22:57,699
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think he may have left out another couple there.

238
00:22:57,719 --> 00:23:10,569
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, if you could update that list and let people know that these aren't open to the public, so people don't get confused and think they could just go into Harvard-Vanguard or just, you know, I live near Tufts and I'll run up to the student health services.

239
00:23:11,349 --> 00:23:11,950
[SPEAKER_14]: Which is fair.

240
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:14,411
[SPEAKER_14]: So we can make that update.

241
00:23:15,312 --> 00:23:19,655
[SPEAKER_14]: Our own urgent care, you don't have to be a patient of Hallmark Health or Lawrence Memorial Hospital to go there.

242
00:23:19,956 --> 00:23:20,856
[SPEAKER_14]: We're open to anyone.

243
00:23:22,133 --> 00:23:23,935
[SPEAKER_14]: So we can certainly make that adjustment.

244
00:23:23,955 --> 00:23:30,360
[SPEAKER_14]: But we're open to anyone, no matter who your PCP is, or no matter what your insurance is, which is not always the same.

245
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,341
[SPEAKER_14]: So we can make that clear.

246
00:23:31,401 --> 00:23:32,562
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand.

247
00:23:32,682 --> 00:23:37,806
[SPEAKER_09]: Hallmark's not even on the list, so you should have yourself at the top of the list then.

248
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:38,447
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

249
00:23:40,789 --> 00:23:41,869
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Caviello.

250
00:23:44,392 --> 00:23:44,992
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Knight.

251
00:23:47,254 --> 00:23:50,136
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, at this point, I believe we did have a resident from the community that

252
00:23:51,944 --> 00:24:00,368
[SPEAKER_18]: I think maybe we should turn the floor over to her and see if there are any issues that have come up through the small meetings in the community that may be able to be addressed this evening as well.

253
00:24:01,289 --> 00:24:01,689
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

254
00:24:01,729 --> 00:24:18,697
[SPEAKER_16]: So at this point, we'll take up 19-064 petition by Beverly O'Reilly, 16 Joyce Road, Medford, Massachusetts, to present a list of requests and conditions that were made to Melrose Wakefield Hospital at a small meeting in response to their plan to build an ambulatory service center.

255
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:25,062
[SPEAKER_16]: Could we please have your name and address for the record, please?

256
00:24:25,082 --> 00:24:26,983
[SPEAKER_26]: Beverly O'Reilly, 16 Joyce Road.

257
00:24:29,566 --> 00:24:34,069
[SPEAKER_26]: First, I want to thank the counselors that attended our small neighborhood meeting last week.

258
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:34,890
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you very much.

259
00:24:36,091 --> 00:24:38,033
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you to the hospital for meeting with us.

260
00:24:39,054 --> 00:24:46,080
[SPEAKER_16]: I think the heat goes on every so often, and that seems to...

261
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:49,401
[SPEAKER_16]: So if you could speak really loud, I'd appreciate it.

262
00:24:49,461 --> 00:24:50,222
[SPEAKER_26]: Some of you know me.

263
00:24:50,302 --> 00:24:50,942
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm an abutter.

264
00:24:51,042 --> 00:24:54,605
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm also the newest member of the community advisory group.

265
00:24:55,206 --> 00:24:57,427
[SPEAKER_26]: There are three abutters that are on this group now.

266
00:24:58,428 --> 00:25:08,315
[SPEAKER_26]: Last week, the hospital met with some of the neighbors on Holmes, Hutchins, and Joyce roads to talk about our concerns that we have with this project.

267
00:25:08,375 --> 00:25:10,497
[SPEAKER_26]: We've been speaking out about this for a while now.

268
00:25:11,326 --> 00:25:16,708
[SPEAKER_26]: So I was thanking the council members that showed up last week and thanking the hospital for meeting with us.

269
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:26,332
[SPEAKER_26]: Some of our neighbors met prior to the meeting with the hospital to generate a list of our concerns.

270
00:25:27,033 --> 00:25:34,236
[SPEAKER_26]: And we made a list of requests to the hospital and presented it at our meeting last week as a result.

271
00:25:36,617 --> 00:25:38,958
[SPEAKER_26]: Those concerns are

272
00:25:40,812 --> 00:25:43,913
[SPEAKER_26]: from several of us neighbors, but certainly not all of the neighbors.

273
00:25:44,353 --> 00:25:55,375
[SPEAKER_26]: And each of us has different concerns, so that list in its totality is what we would like to see addressed as part of the proposal to build this ASC.

274
00:25:57,715 --> 00:26:07,657
[SPEAKER_26]: We would very much like for the hospital to make the proposal to this body, because we believe that you are going to best protect our interests

275
00:26:08,812 --> 00:26:11,753
[SPEAKER_26]: over the zoning board or some other city agencies.

276
00:26:12,933 --> 00:26:17,434
[SPEAKER_26]: So we're hoping that that request comes to you for approval.

277
00:26:18,134 --> 00:26:35,857
[SPEAKER_26]: There's one thing that we did not list on the list that will be presented to you by my neighbor Tara after I speak, and that is that we would like for the hospital, the ASC, to keep their practices to weekday business hours only and not expand that into nights and weekends.

278
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:45,064
[SPEAKER_26]: Your comments tonight, wow, about how it was a business decision to close down the emergency room in the hospital.

279
00:26:45,184 --> 00:26:46,044
[SPEAKER_26]: That's heartbreaking.

280
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:52,809
[SPEAKER_26]: None of us wanted to see the hospital go away in favor of an outpatient for-profit surgery center.

281
00:26:57,432 --> 00:27:07,438
[SPEAKER_26]: We also ask that the ASC, when they make this proposal to you, do it with the respect of the neighbors and not at the expense of the neighbors.

282
00:27:08,782 --> 00:27:21,767
[SPEAKER_26]: And again, and especially because it's a for-profit business and not a hospital that's serving only our community where they're basically going to create a supersized ER in another community that's not convenient for us.

283
00:27:22,707 --> 00:27:25,328
[SPEAKER_26]: The site selection is not the preferred location.

284
00:27:25,428 --> 00:27:27,709
[SPEAKER_26]: This is not ideally where we would like to have it.

285
00:27:27,789 --> 00:27:30,610
[SPEAKER_26]: We are very concerned about parking, and you'll hear more about that.

286
00:27:31,998 --> 00:27:39,421
[SPEAKER_26]: We feel strongly that all of the conditions in our list be met and addressed and not just cherry pick the ones that are easy, like build the wall.

287
00:27:41,182 --> 00:27:51,826
[SPEAKER_26]: And we feel that there's, another thing is that there's been a lot of discussion about in and outpatient mental health services in the old building and that remains unresolved.

288
00:27:51,906 --> 00:27:58,288
[SPEAKER_26]: We've not heard any answer as to whether they will not expand upon that.

289
00:27:59,413 --> 00:28:08,358
[SPEAKER_26]: And my neighbor Tara is going to get up and present just the bullet points of this list that will be presented to all of you as well so that you'll have it on record.

290
00:28:08,438 --> 00:28:09,159
[SPEAKER_26]: Thanks very much.

291
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:16,563
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

292
00:28:16,583 --> 00:28:19,745
[SPEAKER_27]: Hi, Tara Minor, 29 Hutchins Road.

293
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:26,969
[SPEAKER_27]: So as Beverly said, I'm just really going to read through this list and then we'll present it to you.

294
00:28:28,285 --> 00:28:42,011
[SPEAKER_27]: But top of our list is concerns with the location, locale of the loading dock and the garbage receptacles and how that really backs up to our neighborhood.

295
00:28:43,191 --> 00:28:45,713
[SPEAKER_27]: So a lot of the issues that we're raising here are

296
00:28:47,513 --> 00:28:58,180
[SPEAKER_27]: related to that noise pollution but also related to the safety and the quality of life for our neighborhood.

297
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:02,043
[SPEAKER_27]: So first is the noise pollution.

298
00:29:03,103 --> 00:29:06,525
[SPEAKER_27]: We're asking that the trash pickup be limited from 7 a.m.

299
00:29:06,625 --> 00:29:06,806
[SPEAKER_27]: to 6 p.m.

300
00:29:06,826 --> 00:29:06,866
[SPEAKER_27]: in

301
00:29:09,393 --> 00:29:35,719
[SPEAKER_27]: accordance to the Medford noise ordinance, and that any traffic that goes between the north parking lot of the hospital and up to the nursing home be limited to really to staff and patients of the nursing home, not be opened up to

302
00:29:37,048 --> 00:29:41,151
[SPEAKER_27]: hospital traffic so that traffic can be minimized in that area.

303
00:29:43,092 --> 00:29:52,759
[SPEAKER_27]: We are looking to minimize the resident parking or non-resident parking and traffic within our neighborhood.

304
00:29:55,482 --> 00:30:03,888
[SPEAKER_27]: Kind of would like to start off with not having like restrictions and parking for the neighbors because we do like to

305
00:30:04,346 --> 00:30:16,849
[SPEAKER_27]: park on our street, but instead put signage on the entry to the neighborhood to clearly indicate that it's not an entry to the hospital.

306
00:30:16,949 --> 00:30:22,630
[SPEAKER_27]: We have a lot of people coming into our neighborhood thinking that it's a hospital entry.

307
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:25,651
[SPEAKER_27]: Let's see.

308
00:30:26,671 --> 00:30:32,412
[SPEAKER_27]: And I'd like to see that the hospital has a robust plan

309
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:39,848
[SPEAKER_27]: to enforce park, like stickered parking for staff and students.

310
00:30:40,148 --> 00:30:45,790
[SPEAKER_27]: Like I understand staff are not supposed to, you know, they're allowed to park on.

311
00:30:46,452 --> 00:30:51,014
[SPEAKER_27]: premise, but once that gets full, they're going to be parking in our neighborhoods.

312
00:30:51,154 --> 00:31:06,140
[SPEAKER_27]: So we'd like to see a sticker for staff, both staff and students, so that we can clearly identify if someone from staff, you know, the hospital is parking in the neighborhood.

313
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:14,383
[SPEAKER_27]: To commit to not having a parking garage, we'd like to see that in writing.

314
00:31:16,475 --> 00:31:23,217
[SPEAKER_27]: maintain the safety of our neighborhood by making sure that the parking lot is patrolled throughout the evening.

315
00:31:25,838 --> 00:31:34,120
[SPEAKER_27]: And also to work with the city to make sure that there's appropriate crosswalks across governors.

316
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:43,102
[SPEAKER_27]: There's right now, it can be quite dangerous if you're crossing, especially with the hill, you really can't see

317
00:31:45,015 --> 00:31:46,596
[SPEAKER_27]: if someone is crossing the street there.

318
00:31:48,477 --> 00:32:10,773
[SPEAKER_27]: The tree line that borders our neighborhood and the hospital, that that be fully maintained and not just maintained, but increased to cut down any noise pollution and so that we have more green space that's

319
00:32:12,233 --> 00:32:16,255
[SPEAKER_27]: kind of separating the neighborhood and the hospital.

320
00:32:18,096 --> 00:32:20,757
[SPEAKER_27]: That the light pollution be minimized.

321
00:32:21,157 --> 00:32:37,644
[SPEAKER_27]: Today the light pollution is not that bad, but once you start really increasing the use of that parking lot, we'd like to see that the lighting selected be dark sky friendly.

322
00:32:38,703 --> 00:32:54,137
[SPEAKER_27]: and have low illumination limits, that the aesthetic impact be minimized for the hospital.

323
00:32:54,157 --> 00:33:02,465
[SPEAKER_27]: I would love to see the surrounding neighborhoods have input on what the building looks like,

324
00:33:05,606 --> 00:33:11,769
[SPEAKER_27]: signage not be this glaring, basically that we don't have a strip mall next to our houses.

325
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:20,692
[SPEAKER_27]: And that there be regular mode of communication for abutters.

326
00:33:20,872 --> 00:33:33,037
[SPEAKER_27]: And not just, I'd like to see, we'd like to see that that be a documented commitment to the communication that's taking place

327
00:33:33,558 --> 00:33:37,160
[SPEAKER_27]: while they're building, but afterwards, what's that look like ongoing?

328
00:33:38,901 --> 00:33:57,210
[SPEAKER_27]: And last, and we've started talking to them about this, is shutting off the entry between the Holmes Road neighborhood and our neighborhood and the hospital.

329
00:33:57,630 --> 00:34:02,553
[SPEAKER_27]: There's a cut through that goes right through, right from the hospital

330
00:34:03,414 --> 00:34:15,977
[SPEAKER_27]: the neighborhood of Holmes Road, Hutchins, and Joyce Road, that that be closed off with some kind of barrier, whether it be a fence or wall.

331
00:34:16,057 --> 00:34:20,177
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean, we would have to work with the hospital on that one.

332
00:34:20,678 --> 00:34:28,759
[SPEAKER_27]: But that barrier go from the nursing home right down to governors, and probably even take the corner there because there's

333
00:34:33,387 --> 00:34:37,329
[SPEAKER_27]: the folks on governors are going to be impacted too.

334
00:34:37,349 --> 00:34:42,892
[SPEAKER_27]: So that would help those to the left of governors minimize that.

335
00:34:45,293 --> 00:34:57,920
[SPEAKER_27]: And that barrier that we put up, that there be an evergreen tree barrier that is facing the neighborhood so that we don't have to look at a big fence either.

336
00:34:59,772 --> 00:35:03,194
[SPEAKER_27]: So with that, I'm going to just submit these.

337
00:35:03,294 --> 00:35:06,155
[SPEAKER_27]: I have multiple copies.

338
00:35:06,315 --> 00:35:08,136
[SPEAKER_16]: Can I give those to the messenger, please?

339
00:35:08,236 --> 00:35:10,658
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

340
00:35:10,678 --> 00:35:11,118
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me.

341
00:35:11,158 --> 00:35:12,419
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't mean to interject.

342
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:13,439
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

343
00:35:13,779 --> 00:35:18,602
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is John Tancredi, and I'm a 34-year resident of Governor's Ave.

344
00:35:19,102 --> 00:35:22,984
[SPEAKER_01]: I live directly across the street from the Lawrence Memorial Hospital.

345
00:35:23,605 --> 00:35:27,507
[SPEAKER_01]: Literally, the view out my bedroom window is the parking lot

346
00:35:28,475 --> 00:35:34,184
[SPEAKER_01]: the upper campus, the lower campus, and all the way down to the corner of Lawrence Road.

347
00:35:36,187 --> 00:35:41,856
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize for the way I'm going to say this, but what you just heard is the reason why I have been left out of the circle.

348
00:35:43,225 --> 00:35:46,629
[SPEAKER_01]: I was supposed to be the next member of that council that they put together.

349
00:35:48,011 --> 00:35:56,522
[SPEAKER_01]: The emails that I have said that they wanted somebody who can directly view the entire campus from Governors Avenue.

350
00:35:57,243 --> 00:36:00,748
[SPEAKER_01]: They talked to me, they asked what I had for suggestions.

351
00:36:01,188 --> 00:36:13,097
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as they heard that I had suggestions that might cost them a little bit of money, I stopped getting emails, phone calls, and now I've been cut out of the loop completely, and I wasn't even informed that they had made a selection.

352
00:36:14,038 --> 00:36:19,962
[SPEAKER_01]: And as far as these meetings, they were letting us know about these meetings.

353
00:36:20,483 --> 00:36:27,148
[SPEAKER_01]: As of yet, we, again, they have cut us off completely from any meetings because once they heard that we had some demands,

354
00:36:28,634 --> 00:36:36,137
[SPEAKER_01]: they were requests and suggestions, now they're demands, then again, they decided, hey, hey, hey, you know what?

355
00:36:36,197 --> 00:36:37,457
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like the way this guy talks.

356
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:40,438
[SPEAKER_01]: He's not really the kind of guy that we want to deal with.

357
00:36:40,978 --> 00:36:42,039
[SPEAKER_01]: He knows a little too much.

358
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:51,062
[SPEAKER_01]: They say they want to breathe light back into the campus, and I think that's great.

359
00:36:53,129 --> 00:36:58,013
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the reason, there's a lot of reasons why there's light taken out of that campus.

360
00:36:58,834 --> 00:37:09,124
[SPEAKER_01]: But if they want to start this project, they need to take everything that everybody in that neighborhood has, every abutter, everybody that can view it.

361
00:37:09,464 --> 00:37:11,346
[SPEAKER_01]: I can view it, smell it, hear it, taste it.

362
00:37:11,826 --> 00:37:15,730
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when they did the nursing home, they cracked our foundation.

363
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:19,813
[SPEAKER_01]: It cost like $62,000 back in 1990 money.

364
00:37:21,373 --> 00:37:40,478
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, we're asking questions and instead of saying, hey, this is your answer, it's, well, we're going to do this and we're going to put a committee and we're going to get... Well, if it's all going to happen, then this data talking about a summertime just doesn't make any sense to me because they haven't addressed any of the issues as far as I'm concerned.

365
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:50,253
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as what they need to do, it's being transparent without us having to tell them to be transparent.

366
00:37:50,273 --> 00:37:51,994
[SPEAKER_01]: They only say stuff after I do.

367
00:37:52,134 --> 00:37:53,094
[SPEAKER_01]: I even have it in emails.

368
00:37:53,514 --> 00:37:56,736
[SPEAKER_01]: They only release stuff after I say, hey, we know about this.

369
00:37:57,256 --> 00:38:02,898
[SPEAKER_01]: Then all of a sudden, an hour later, there's an email going out to everybody saying, hey, just a heads up on this.

370
00:38:03,829 --> 00:38:09,251
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's annoying to say the least, and it's just bad, bad practices altogether.

371
00:38:09,851 --> 00:38:12,992
[SPEAKER_01]: And for you guys to pretend like you don't know what's going on, that's lame.

372
00:38:14,933 --> 00:38:27,778
[SPEAKER_01]: We need a list of what this ambulatory center is going to be comprised of, what the future steps need to be taken for these entities to get said permit,

373
00:38:29,167 --> 00:38:32,550
[SPEAKER_01]: And not to mention a list of these entities.

374
00:38:33,051 --> 00:38:44,521
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't even have a list of the entities that are supposedly pulling these permits, let alone any sort of guarantee that these will be the entities that will be there in any sort of perpetuity for any amount of time.

375
00:38:45,381 --> 00:38:46,763
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say three of them pop in.

376
00:38:47,483 --> 00:38:48,084
[SPEAKER_01]: Who do we go to?

377
00:38:48,144 --> 00:38:49,085
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it's past the buck.

378
00:38:49,105 --> 00:38:49,765
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's not us.

379
00:38:49,865 --> 00:38:51,066
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Chase.

380
00:38:51,146 --> 00:38:51,687
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not us.

381
00:38:51,807 --> 00:38:53,208
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Shields.

382
00:38:53,268 --> 00:38:53,709
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not us.

383
00:38:55,575 --> 00:39:01,519
[SPEAKER_01]: and then another one sublets it out, something to this one, and then they don't have to follow any rules and regulations of the property.

384
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:04,461
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they're just not listening to anything we have to say.

385
00:39:04,881 --> 00:39:06,262
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'd like a list of all that.

386
00:39:06,602 --> 00:39:22,773
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd also like some sort of list of all concerns by all the residents, all the city council members, any concerns that any Medford resident has about this new for-profit business just popping up in their city that's involved in healthcare.

387
00:39:23,623 --> 00:39:27,968
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm sorry, but you'd do it for a bar, wouldn't you?

388
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:30,291
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, come on.

389
00:39:30,791 --> 00:39:33,715
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about what people are doing for these recreational marijuana facilities.

390
00:39:34,255 --> 00:39:41,243
[SPEAKER_01]: This place is going to be doing surgery and they're making profit, not to mention it's in a spot that was deemed not for profit.

391
00:39:41,484 --> 00:39:42,345
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to get into that.

392
00:39:45,392 --> 00:39:55,836
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing, would like some sort of direct line or email that can assure that residents can get answers to these questions and that somebody's actually going to respond?

393
00:39:55,856 --> 00:39:59,458
[SPEAKER_01]: And if not, then they can be held accountable because it's past the buck.

394
00:40:00,238 --> 00:40:00,818
[SPEAKER_01]: Past the buck.

395
00:40:01,018 --> 00:40:02,259
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, well, you need to talk to this one.

396
00:40:02,279 --> 00:40:03,299
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to talk to that one.

397
00:40:03,899 --> 00:40:05,380
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, it's...

398
00:40:06,162 --> 00:40:07,003
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a broken loop.

399
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:08,123
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a broken loop.

400
00:40:09,524 --> 00:40:23,815
[SPEAKER_01]: We would like, again, as she had mentioned, an operation guide to this surgical center and what their hours of operation will be, what their time restrictions will be, what their parking situation would be.

401
00:40:24,643 --> 00:40:26,363
[SPEAKER_01]: any sort of transportation vehicles?

402
00:40:26,824 --> 00:40:43,908
[SPEAKER_01]: Because let me tell you, on Governor's Ave, as it is right now, and this committee, as far as that traffic study, I was told in no uncertain terms that the traffic study and parking study had been completed and that there would be a negligible impact on the neighborhood.

403
00:40:44,308 --> 00:40:44,928
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that not true?

404
00:40:46,509 --> 00:40:47,669
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's what I was told, thanks.

405
00:40:48,369 --> 00:40:49,670
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you respond?

406
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:50,530
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely, go ahead.

407
00:40:51,992 --> 00:40:56,974
[SPEAKER_14]: No, we shared our results for the parking and traffic study.

408
00:40:57,855 --> 00:40:58,875
[SPEAKER_14]: They were preliminary.

409
00:40:59,015 --> 00:41:04,378
[SPEAKER_14]: We have not submitted the full package because of the concerns that were raised.

410
00:41:04,458 --> 00:41:10,441
[SPEAKER_14]: And as I've talked about the escalating construction costs, we're seeing what other mitigation strategies we can go into effect.

411
00:41:10,841 --> 00:41:20,045
[SPEAKER_14]: Based on the current plan that has been put out there and the results that we showed from VHB, we do feel it was a negligible parking and traffic impact.

412
00:41:20,673 --> 00:41:28,038
[SPEAKER_14]: That being said, we're going back, and we have to look at all the other factors we talked about to address the concerns that have been raised.

413
00:41:28,378 --> 00:41:33,421
[SPEAKER_14]: And then VHB will submit the study, which will do a peer review.

414
00:41:34,362 --> 00:41:34,562
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

415
00:41:35,974 --> 00:41:42,960
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that brings up another concern about the actual lot and the employees, sort of a good neighbor policy.

416
00:41:44,241 --> 00:41:46,002
[SPEAKER_01]: The employees, some of them, they're very rude.

417
00:41:47,043 --> 00:41:51,366
[SPEAKER_01]: And as far as the hospital security, absolute lax, to say the least.

418
00:41:51,987 --> 00:41:59,473
[SPEAKER_01]: And if the hospital's operating right now at the lowest capacity they've ever been at, and these guys can't handle what's going on now, I hate to see it when it's slammed.

419
00:42:00,113 --> 00:42:00,614
[SPEAKER_01]: I really do.

420
00:42:01,074 --> 00:42:01,814
[SPEAKER_01]: That concerns me.

421
00:42:02,916 --> 00:42:11,547
[SPEAKER_01]: The police have been there at least six times in the last three months, a couple times for irate people in the lot, a couple times for drunk employees.

422
00:42:12,468 --> 00:42:14,691
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another concern that I'd like to talk to you after this.

423
00:42:14,711 --> 00:42:18,676
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to bring it up in front of everybody else and waste everybody's time, but I think you need to know about that.

424
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:25,733
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, the lots is not secure.

425
00:42:26,074 --> 00:42:27,395
[SPEAKER_01]: There's people in the neighborhoods.

426
00:42:27,755 --> 00:42:31,778
[SPEAKER_01]: They have these big buses and transports that nobody pays attention to.

427
00:42:32,218 --> 00:42:35,541
[SPEAKER_01]: And they pull up because I have a large stretch in front of my house with no driveway.

428
00:42:35,981 --> 00:42:42,246
[SPEAKER_01]: They love to pull up there and just idle, hang out there, wait, take their break, watch TV on their phone.

429
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:44,387
[SPEAKER_01]: And it rattles the windows.

430
00:42:44,447 --> 00:42:45,929
[SPEAKER_01]: Not to mention, idling's against the law.

431
00:42:45,989 --> 00:42:48,030
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've called the hospital.

432
00:42:48,330 --> 00:42:48,871
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't care.

433
00:42:49,411 --> 00:42:50,252
[SPEAKER_01]: I've called the companies.

434
00:42:51,413 --> 00:42:51,933
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't care.

435
00:42:52,854 --> 00:42:55,957
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe if there was a security guard out there to say, hey, guys, knock it off.

436
00:42:56,377 --> 00:42:58,299
[SPEAKER_01]: We got neighbors.

437
00:42:58,639 --> 00:42:59,760
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was a kid, they were there.

438
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:02,542
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was a kid, they had security guards everywhere.

439
00:43:03,563 --> 00:43:05,805
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to play Frisbee over there, and they'd chase us around.

440
00:43:06,545 --> 00:43:08,447
[SPEAKER_01]: But now you can go over there and light a bomb.

441
00:43:09,708 --> 00:43:12,771
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'd be lucky if someone popped their shade open.

442
00:43:14,652 --> 00:43:15,453
[SPEAKER_01]: It's unsafe.

443
00:43:15,913 --> 00:43:16,534
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is.

444
00:43:17,074 --> 00:43:20,597
[SPEAKER_01]: And that doesn't even get into the concerns about

445
00:43:21,282 --> 00:43:26,544
[SPEAKER_01]: The current light pollution, unfortunately, they don't see it from their side, which is good for you guys.

446
00:43:26,624 --> 00:43:37,568
[SPEAKER_01]: But on Governor's Ave, especially since they put these, the hospital's bad enough with the security lights, and then they just put in these new LEDs on Governor's Ave that lights it up like Fenway.

447
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:44,491
[SPEAKER_01]: Me and my neighbors put in room darkening shades, and it's only from the hospital property.

448
00:43:44,531 --> 00:43:46,912
[SPEAKER_01]: They only put it there because of the hospital property.

449
00:43:46,932 --> 00:43:50,253
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like all the new curb stones that they just put in on the hospital side.

450
00:43:51,866 --> 00:43:55,371
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, eyesore value on this new thing is going to be a big thing.

451
00:43:55,411 --> 00:43:58,356
[SPEAKER_01]: They're telling me it's going to be slab construction.

452
00:43:58,396 --> 00:43:59,739
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not going to have to drill.

453
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:01,642
[SPEAKER_01]: Not going to affect the water table.

454
00:44:02,068 --> 00:44:07,070
[SPEAKER_01]: And all this research is already done, so that's what I'm assuming is going to be how things go.

455
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:18,235
[SPEAKER_01]: But if they're going to decide to put a parking garage in, that means nothing as far as who cares what that little building.

456
00:44:18,255 --> 00:44:22,756
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're going to throw up this tower, who the hell wants to see that?

457
00:44:23,217 --> 00:44:31,460
[SPEAKER_01]: Their solution, they told me that they were going to have all nursing school students, and I forget the other genre they threw in there,

458
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:34,722
[SPEAKER_01]: park off campus and shuttle bus in.

459
00:44:36,083 --> 00:44:38,585
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say they got a better chance of seeing God.

460
00:44:39,325 --> 00:44:42,187
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the people have been, I mean, come on.

461
00:44:43,088 --> 00:44:43,728
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about that.

462
00:44:43,949 --> 00:44:44,229
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?

463
00:44:46,827 --> 00:44:53,390
[SPEAKER_01]: If they do decide to get this project approved, I'm more than happy to, you know, offer my advice on what they need to do.

464
00:44:53,450 --> 00:44:55,351
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they need to hire local construction.

465
00:44:55,451 --> 00:44:56,932
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to hire local contractors.

466
00:44:56,952 --> 00:44:59,294
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs to be all green construction, 110%.

467
00:44:59,334 --> 00:45:04,276
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs to have no eyesore value whatsoever.

468
00:45:04,296 --> 00:45:10,760
[SPEAKER_01]: It can't exceed one story, like they said or they claimed, and that doesn't mean one story and then

469
00:45:11,505 --> 00:45:16,088
[SPEAKER_01]: air conditioners and these big metal, they put this big metal fence up on top of the building on the other side.

470
00:45:16,108 --> 00:45:17,048
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what the hell that's doing.

471
00:45:17,068 --> 00:45:19,990
[SPEAKER_01]: But ever since that went up, it's interrupting cell phone service.

472
00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:21,370
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another thing.

473
00:45:21,731 --> 00:45:23,151
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want drain on the power grid.

474
00:45:24,112 --> 00:45:25,893
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want cell phone interruption.

475
00:45:26,373 --> 00:45:28,814
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want any of that crap.

476
00:45:28,894 --> 00:45:30,555
[SPEAKER_01]: And it does happen, unfortunately.

477
00:45:31,276 --> 00:45:35,658
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they wouldn't want us turning on our cell phones next to the serotonin.

478
00:45:39,973 --> 00:45:42,374
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other big thing, community engagement.

479
00:45:43,214 --> 00:45:48,136
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to hire local people, give locals a job opportunity first.

480
00:45:49,356 --> 00:45:58,479
[SPEAKER_01]: And they also need to maybe have some... Right now, everybody feels like it's just like, okay, well, they're dropping this in our yard and there's absolutely nothing we can do about it.

481
00:45:59,519 --> 00:46:02,060
[SPEAKER_01]: And then people are like, oh, we got a few people that are like, oh, well,

482
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:05,823
[SPEAKER_01]: let's try to work with them so that it's not so bad.

483
00:46:06,844 --> 00:46:10,888
[SPEAKER_01]: How about do something for us that makes us go, yeah, hey, this is cool.

484
00:46:11,008 --> 00:46:12,830
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting this ambulatory surgical center.

485
00:46:13,713 --> 00:46:19,236
[SPEAKER_01]: like it's for us, like maybe like a discount program, you know, I'm sure a couple of you need knees or ankles or something, right?

486
00:46:19,256 --> 00:46:21,137
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I had an accident, right?

487
00:46:21,257 --> 00:46:23,419
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, come on, right?

488
00:46:23,439 --> 00:46:26,240
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, just something to make it feel like, right?

489
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:28,241
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, something to make it feel like it's ours.

490
00:46:28,282 --> 00:46:30,923
[SPEAKER_01]: They just got this great new machine out there.

491
00:46:32,084 --> 00:46:39,388
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, with all the noise pollution we deal with, I mean, because there is a lot over there from them grinding the pavement with the

492
00:46:39,822 --> 00:46:41,784
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes, I even got pictures on my phone.

493
00:46:41,804 --> 00:46:43,405
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they had landscapers out there.

494
00:46:43,425 --> 00:46:46,908
[SPEAKER_01]: It was eight guys with leaf blowers just standing there in a row doing this.

495
00:46:47,488 --> 00:46:48,869
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, absolutely.

496
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:50,130
[SPEAKER_01]: You've seen it, right?

497
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:52,352
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's horrible.

498
00:46:52,412 --> 00:46:53,613
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes on for hours.

499
00:46:54,213 --> 00:46:56,355
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, well, what are you doing to us?

500
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:00,201
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Jesus, I'm sorry.

501
00:47:00,221 --> 00:47:01,561
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't mean to go all into that.

502
00:47:01,581 --> 00:47:10,544
[SPEAKER_01]: So they just got this nifty little machine that clears a sidewalk of snow, the entire sidewalk in about a minute flat, complete hill.

503
00:47:10,964 --> 00:47:12,125
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't they do the abutters?

504
00:47:12,145 --> 00:47:15,526
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't they do the entire sidewalk like Boston University Medical Center does?

505
00:47:15,586 --> 00:47:18,047
[SPEAKER_01]: They do their sidewalk and the sidewalk across the street.

506
00:47:19,047 --> 00:47:20,088
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just karma courtesy.

507
00:47:23,389 --> 00:47:25,590
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, again, those were just some things that

508
00:47:26,867 --> 00:47:38,455
[SPEAKER_01]: that I think definitely needs to be addressed on top of the whole fact that they're just trying to dance around it and dodge it, and they're not being transparent at all.

509
00:47:39,236 --> 00:47:40,817
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't sit well with us at all.

510
00:47:40,877 --> 00:47:41,898
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't sit well with me.

511
00:47:42,375 --> 00:47:44,136
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure it doesn't sit well with any of you.

512
00:47:44,556 --> 00:47:51,120
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were having something done in your neighborhood, you wouldn't want to get lied to and told, yeah, hey, we're going to get right back to you.

513
00:47:51,781 --> 00:47:54,542
[SPEAKER_01]: And every time you call, the guy goes, yeah, no problem, buddy.

514
00:47:54,562 --> 00:47:55,563
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll take care of it.

515
00:47:55,583 --> 00:47:56,484
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure thing.

516
00:47:56,844 --> 00:47:57,844
[SPEAKER_01]: Call me by my nickname.

517
00:47:57,904 --> 00:47:59,485
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Tank, buddy, have a good one.

518
00:47:59,525 --> 00:47:59,866
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll see you.

519
00:48:00,246 --> 00:48:00,686
[SPEAKER_01]: Who are you?

520
00:48:01,046 --> 00:48:01,787
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, come on.

521
00:48:02,627 --> 00:48:04,129
[SPEAKER_01]: It's patronizing.

522
00:48:04,269 --> 00:48:04,850
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is.

523
00:48:04,970 --> 00:48:07,112
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not the type of thing that I want in my city.

524
00:48:08,053 --> 00:48:17,604
[SPEAKER_01]: And unless they're going to make some severe changes between now and whenever they want this project completed, I don't want it in the neighborhood.

525
00:48:18,404 --> 00:48:19,626
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where I'm at right now.

526
00:48:19,966 --> 00:48:20,306
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

527
00:48:20,967 --> 00:48:21,167
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

528
00:48:21,207 --> 00:48:21,628
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, guys.

529
00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:48,551
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Robert Penter.

530
00:48:48,611 --> 00:48:51,915
[SPEAKER_05]: I reside at Zero Summit Road and a former member of this August party.

531
00:48:52,335 --> 00:48:56,039
[SPEAKER_05]: You're probably asking why I haven't been here for the last two meetings, and I'll be quite candid with you.

532
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:03,586
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe it's just a done deal no matter what's going to happen, whether the emergency room is going to close or the ASC Center is going in.

533
00:49:03,667 --> 00:49:05,909
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems to be it's going to go through.

534
00:49:06,529 --> 00:49:10,934
[SPEAKER_05]: But what this council does have is a voice in the concerns

535
00:49:11,472 --> 00:49:15,857
[SPEAKER_05]: that the determination of need does not have.

536
00:49:16,478 --> 00:49:21,024
[SPEAKER_05]: I was asked by a couple of people, just as your position, how come you're always coming up here?

537
00:49:21,324 --> 00:49:22,325
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got something to say.

538
00:49:22,365 --> 00:49:23,507
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, how are you going to prove it?

539
00:49:24,388 --> 00:49:27,872
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm going to go back, because I keep everything, as you know.

540
00:49:29,394 --> 00:49:29,875
[SPEAKER_05]: I go back to 2012.

541
00:49:31,347 --> 00:49:41,851
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a resolution offered by myself before the Medford City Council, 2012, asking about whether, in fact, the Lawrence Memorial Hospital is going to be up for sale or not.

542
00:49:42,511 --> 00:49:49,614
[SPEAKER_05]: And subsequent to that meeting, we got a response back from Michael Sack, who appeared before the Medford City Council some time later.

543
00:49:49,874 --> 00:49:51,235
[SPEAKER_05]: This was in March.

544
00:49:51,595 --> 00:49:54,316
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe it was in September or October of that year.

545
00:49:54,736 --> 00:49:58,478
[SPEAKER_05]: He indicated that Lawrence Memorial Hospital was financially blessed.

546
00:49:59,410 --> 00:50:03,993
[SPEAKER_05]: We were going to see at least a minimum of $150 million worth of an infusion in the hospital.

547
00:50:04,874 --> 00:50:06,275
[SPEAKER_05]: And it looked pretty good.

548
00:50:06,475 --> 00:50:09,917
[SPEAKER_05]: But he did say, and I will give him credit, he did say, medicine is changing.

549
00:50:09,957 --> 00:50:12,859
[SPEAKER_05]: And while medicine is changing, you need to be concerned.

550
00:50:13,459 --> 00:50:20,944
[SPEAKER_05]: So at that point in time, what the concern was, it didn't go any further than that, other than coming here, giving us a response as to what have you.

551
00:50:21,705 --> 00:50:24,347
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, the history of parking in the Lawrence Memorial Hospital goes back to 2000.

552
00:50:25,292 --> 00:50:27,093
[SPEAKER_05]: and three in 2004.

553
00:50:27,933 --> 00:50:46,621
[SPEAKER_05]: Once again, as a member of the council, I brought it to the attention of then Christine Candio and she was the executive vice president because at that point in time in the neighborhood, employees were parking all around Lawrence Ave, Summit Road, Crest Road, up and up over there at the lot of park.

554
00:50:47,162 --> 00:50:51,924
[SPEAKER_05]: And she indicated at that point in time, what they were going to do in her letter dated September 16th,

555
00:50:53,318 --> 00:51:01,422
[SPEAKER_05]: 2004, she said, pursuant to our conversation on Tuesday, September 16th, the services at the Lawrence Memorial Hospital have grown in the last few years.

556
00:51:01,842 --> 00:51:12,447
[SPEAKER_05]: And she went on to say that on September 7th, we implemented a new employee parking policy, which includes 200 spaces of off-street employee and student parking shuttling.

557
00:51:12,827 --> 00:51:15,248
[SPEAKER_05]: Now to get to this gentleman's point, I'm sorry, I don't know his name,

558
00:51:15,624 --> 00:51:27,589
[SPEAKER_05]: But to get to this gentleman's point, relative to the parking, you're going to have a parking issue if they build 17,500 square feet of a standalone building and take away approximately 65 parking spaces.

559
00:51:27,829 --> 00:51:29,350
[SPEAKER_05]: But we'll get to that a little bit later.

560
00:51:30,010 --> 00:51:42,915
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we're going to go, as you can all remember, thanks to City Clerk, on November 27th of this past year, you got a detailed response back from, I believe her name was Norma Mann, after it took

561
00:51:43,614 --> 00:52:00,282
[SPEAKER_05]: 87 days for the council's letter to reach to the Department of Health, but it states in the following, in their fourth paragraph, the Department of Need program cannot base its determination of a Department of Need application upon community concerns regarding parking, noise, and traffic.

562
00:52:02,041 --> 00:52:13,053
[SPEAKER_05]: but any decision by the department on the application will not impact the rights of the city to enforce zoning or other bylaws to address these quality of life concerns.

563
00:52:13,654 --> 00:52:19,420
[SPEAKER_05]: What I've heard here tonight are quality of life concerns that fall right within the confines of the Medford City Council.

564
00:52:19,917 --> 00:52:21,938
[SPEAKER_05]: And you do have a position to speak up.

565
00:52:22,318 --> 00:52:32,541
[SPEAKER_05]: And if the position by speaking up is enough to stop this from going forward, then bless you, because you're listening to what the concerns are of the neighborhood and what the people feel that you're getting paid for.

566
00:52:33,121 --> 00:52:40,583
[SPEAKER_05]: And then if we go a little bit further, we go into... Wait a minute.

567
00:52:40,623 --> 00:52:41,323
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's not it.

568
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:41,383
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

569
00:52:44,147 --> 00:52:44,987
[SPEAKER_05]: The MBTA.

570
00:52:45,728 --> 00:52:47,829
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, there's nobody here from the MBTA that I'm aware of.

571
00:52:47,869 --> 00:52:48,449
[SPEAKER_05]: What if they are?

572
00:52:48,909 --> 00:52:54,251
[SPEAKER_05]: The rumor seems to be continuously running rampant that they want to run buses or strike that.

573
00:52:54,471 --> 00:53:01,615
[SPEAKER_05]: The hospital is suggesting that buses run by the MBTA up to the Lawrence Memorial location because it's not a hospital anymore.

574
00:53:01,955 --> 00:53:04,016
[SPEAKER_05]: Get rid of that word hospital after March 7th.

575
00:53:04,956 --> 00:53:11,737
[SPEAKER_05]: As a result of that, you're going to be having buses and pollution and everything going through these neighborhoods for a for-profit business.

576
00:53:12,298 --> 00:53:19,419
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, they never consider that for the Lawrence Memorial Hospital, when it was operating with an emergency room and 24-hour service and stays.

577
00:53:20,419 --> 00:53:20,719
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?

578
00:53:21,419 --> 00:53:23,480
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all about money, ladies and gentlemen, and we know that.

579
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:33,822
[SPEAKER_05]: And as Councilman Mox has alluded to, when you had $20 to $30 million sitting in your coffers in 2013, and it all of a sudden disappeared because you intentionally, intentionally

580
00:53:34,292 --> 00:53:41,354
[SPEAKER_05]: made the Lawrence Memorial Hospital emergency room decline to transfer everything over to the Melrose-Wakefield, that's what happened.

581
00:53:41,754 --> 00:53:44,735
[SPEAKER_05]: And as a result of that, this is the position that we're in right now.

582
00:53:46,055 --> 00:53:52,657
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, we go further to turn around and look at the zoning yet to be declared.

583
00:53:54,697 --> 00:53:57,038
[SPEAKER_05]: A representative from the city solicitor's office, Mr. Rumley,

584
00:53:57,870 --> 00:54:08,313
[SPEAKER_05]: rightfully made an indication as it relates to a memo that was sent out on October 10th of last year regarding what if this ASC does come forward.

585
00:54:08,453 --> 00:54:13,934
[SPEAKER_05]: And at that point in time, the building department made an assumption or an assertion what would need to be happened.

586
00:54:13,995 --> 00:54:18,276
[SPEAKER_05]: And Mr. Rumley was right when he turned around and says, since we don't have it, I can't make a decision.

587
00:54:18,976 --> 00:54:26,318
[SPEAKER_05]: But I guess we're getting closer to wanting to make a decision because if that ASC is approved, for which it already tentatively has been approved,

588
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:32,004
[SPEAKER_05]: then if that's the case, you folks on this council need to ask that question immediately.

589
00:54:32,584 --> 00:54:37,428
[SPEAKER_05]: Does or does not zoning need to be changed at this particular location?

590
00:54:37,968 --> 00:54:42,591
[SPEAKER_05]: And now the city solicitor can rightfully make his determination because it's now a done deal.

591
00:54:42,872 --> 00:54:43,812
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a past fact.

592
00:54:45,053 --> 00:54:46,875
[SPEAKER_05]: Now let's go a little bit further.

593
00:54:48,035 --> 00:54:52,579
[SPEAKER_05]: When you talk about the hospital's use, the deed that goes back

594
00:54:53,801 --> 00:54:54,982
[SPEAKER_05]: from Mr. Daniel Lawrence.

595
00:54:55,002 --> 00:54:57,543
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if anyone's had an opportunity to read it, but you have to read it.

596
00:54:57,623 --> 00:54:59,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Then if you read all the six cardinals, they'll go with it.

597
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:08,530
[SPEAKER_05]: And then if you go into the history of Medford and you understand that at that point in time, there was, I believe, two other locations that did hospital type services.

598
00:55:09,490 --> 00:55:20,677
[SPEAKER_05]: But this one was granted under the cardinals between one to six for a hospital to come forward in the city for the particular purpose and only intention of being a hospital.

599
00:55:21,631 --> 00:55:42,044
[SPEAKER_05]: Now the question maybe one of you councilors should ask our city solicitor, since it was specific enough to say a hospital and it's no longer being used as a hospital, and I think we all understand that medical services change through the years, but by changing through the years you've gotten rid of the hospital use because the hospital name has to go.

600
00:55:42,524 --> 00:55:43,805
[SPEAKER_05]: The emergency room is gone.

601
00:55:43,985 --> 00:55:45,306
[SPEAKER_05]: Your 24-hour service is gone.

602
00:55:46,272 --> 00:55:48,554
[SPEAKER_05]: And many, many of the services that are there are gone.

603
00:55:49,315 --> 00:55:51,477
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be called an urgent care.

604
00:55:51,578 --> 00:55:53,840
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what the name is that's going to precede urgent care.

605
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:55,121
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe Lawrence Memorial Urgent Care.

606
00:55:55,442 --> 00:55:55,822
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

607
00:55:56,383 --> 00:55:58,004
[SPEAKER_05]: But the fact of the matter is simply this.

608
00:55:58,084 --> 00:56:06,914
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be a for-profit business running at the expense of the nonprofit business that was there that gave you a hospital, an emergency room, and 24-hour care.

609
00:56:08,455 --> 00:56:09,636
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is what you're losing.

610
00:56:09,976 --> 00:56:12,238
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is what you really need to take into consideration.

611
00:56:12,558 --> 00:56:15,640
[SPEAKER_05]: This is now where the ball is in your court, not the state.

612
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:16,640
[SPEAKER_05]: This is your court.

613
00:56:16,941 --> 00:56:18,762
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is how you can make that determination.

614
00:56:19,282 --> 00:56:22,624
[SPEAKER_05]: And we look at this report that came out in March of 2018.

615
00:56:23,385 --> 00:56:24,485
[SPEAKER_05]: It's voluminous.

616
00:56:25,346 --> 00:56:30,329
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a report that was a combination of USA Today and the Kaiser Health Care News.

617
00:56:31,450 --> 00:56:37,134
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was a combination of California, Indiana, New Jersey, Florida, Washington, DC, and Virginia.

618
00:56:38,210 --> 00:56:45,145
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where these reporters came from and they did a nationwide review of ambulatory surgical centers.

619
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:46,187
[SPEAKER_05]: And from 2013 till now,

620
00:56:48,768 --> 00:56:52,972
[SPEAKER_05]: 265 people have died, unfortunately, because of going there.

621
00:56:53,032 --> 00:56:57,116
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I'm not trying to put it down, but I just think you folks need to be aware of the fact.

622
00:56:57,757 --> 00:57:00,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Because one of the main reasons are they're not properly staffed.

623
00:57:01,201 --> 00:57:05,325
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of these doctors have taken liberties to do more than ambulatory surgery.

624
00:57:05,925 --> 00:57:09,829
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of these patients have gone home quicker than they should have gone home.

625
00:57:10,981 --> 00:57:16,566
[SPEAKER_05]: And they don't come under the same rules and regulations in the Medicare that a hospital does.

626
00:57:16,987 --> 00:57:19,950
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is unbelievable when you read that.

627
00:57:20,290 --> 00:57:22,512
[SPEAKER_05]: The checks and balances are not the same.

628
00:57:22,873 --> 00:57:26,536
[SPEAKER_05]: If you read a hospital report, you'll realize what they have to account for.

629
00:57:27,097 --> 00:57:31,441
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you read a Medicare report on ambulatory surgical centers, it's not the same.

630
00:57:31,641 --> 00:57:34,103
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't even come close to what has to be reported.

631
00:57:34,744 --> 00:57:39,508
[SPEAKER_05]: And in some states, you don't even have to report a death that comes out of an ambulatory surgical center.

632
00:57:39,948 --> 00:57:40,709
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not in there.

633
00:57:41,449 --> 00:57:58,243
[SPEAKER_05]: That's some of the things that you folks need to hold this company that wants to come into our city, you need to hold their feet to the fire and be accountable for every single thing that they do and every single doctor that comes in there and what they're going to perform and how they're going to perform and what is the backup.

634
00:57:58,963 --> 00:58:00,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get to you, Counsel Max.

635
00:58:00,624 --> 00:58:02,024
[SPEAKER_05]: You brought it up last summer.

636
00:58:02,624 --> 00:58:07,226
[SPEAKER_05]: You brought that question up last summer that this lady says, again, she's going to get back to you on.

637
00:58:07,806 --> 00:58:15,069
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the backup for an emergency that needs to take place if an ambulance needs to be called, if the surgery goes wrong, or something happens?

638
00:58:15,709 --> 00:58:20,391
[SPEAKER_05]: That's probably the most important part of this whole idea that this is going to cut costs.

639
00:58:20,951 --> 00:58:30,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure it's going to cut costs, because if you read the report, a lot of the doctors that perform at these ambulatory surgical centers wind up getting these patients as their private patients.

640
00:58:30,875 --> 00:58:34,076
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all about money, and that's great, because this is what America's all about.

641
00:58:34,896 --> 00:58:36,877
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not about cows that don't know how to fluctuate.

642
00:58:37,097 --> 00:58:40,478
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about democracy, and it talks about business.

643
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:43,580
[SPEAKER_05]: And what good business is all about is good medicine.

644
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:47,742
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you have good medicine and good business, you'll have a good, healthy person.

645
00:58:48,542 --> 00:58:52,223
[SPEAKER_05]: But you have to be cognizant as to what's going on.

646
00:58:52,283 --> 00:58:53,144
[SPEAKER_05]: This report took months.

647
00:58:55,832 --> 00:59:08,375
[SPEAKER_05]: It's voluminous to read, but the parts that stand out are the necessity of knowing what this ambulatory surgeon, none of us, including myself, we're no surgeons, we're not doctors, we're not professionals.

648
00:59:09,155 --> 00:59:16,936
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why you really need, before anything goes further, to put your heads together, read the report, read what's going on, ask all these type of questions.

649
00:59:17,116 --> 00:59:18,096
[SPEAKER_05]: Parking is important.

650
00:59:18,656 --> 00:59:19,677
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course it's important.

651
00:59:19,897 --> 00:59:20,977
[SPEAKER_05]: The garage is important.

652
00:59:21,617 --> 00:59:26,441
[SPEAKER_05]: But the most important thing is they took away your hospital to put a for-profit business in.

653
00:59:27,082 --> 00:59:33,847
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the most important thing that you need to understand.

654
00:59:33,927 --> 00:59:37,610
[SPEAKER_05]: Second to the last issue.

655
00:59:39,192 --> 00:59:46,157
[SPEAKER_05]: We've heard the hospital folks come up here and say, oh yeah, they're going to be paying taxes because Shields is coming in.

656
00:59:47,170 --> 00:59:57,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's really not true because the question is now going to be, the footprint of the hospital is now going to have an attachment to Shields, which is a for-profit business.

657
00:59:58,495 --> 01:00:04,218
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, the urgent care section is not going to be part of the Lawrence Memorial Hospital because it doesn't exist anymore.

658
01:00:04,898 --> 01:00:09,320
[SPEAKER_05]: So one or two things can come out as far as you're compromising or you're negotiating tactics.

659
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:13,062
[SPEAKER_05]: A, Shields pays full taxes, excuse me, as if.

660
01:00:13,892 --> 01:00:16,815
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a commercial piece of property because it is commercially run.

661
01:00:17,875 --> 01:00:28,905
[SPEAKER_05]: Second of all, if urgent care is going to be questioned as it relates to being nonprofit, well, then they ought to deal with the city in lieu of tax payment every three years to be reviewed.

662
01:00:29,325 --> 01:00:32,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Because every one of those doctors in there are making money.

663
01:00:32,528 --> 01:00:33,789
[SPEAKER_05]: They're private doctors now.

664
01:00:34,229 --> 01:00:35,390
[SPEAKER_05]: They're working privately.

665
01:00:35,410 --> 01:00:36,791
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not working for a hospital.

666
01:00:37,192 --> 01:00:41,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Hospital no longer exists after March 7th of this year in the city of Medford.

667
01:00:42,489 --> 01:00:44,191
[SPEAKER_05]: And let me just leave you with this last comment.

668
01:00:45,212 --> 01:00:46,194
[SPEAKER_05]: And I appreciate the time.

669
01:00:48,136 --> 01:00:50,739
[SPEAKER_05]: You had a young lady here that worked in the local newspaper.

670
01:00:50,779 --> 01:00:52,041
[SPEAKER_05]: Her name was Miranda Wilson.

671
01:00:55,560 --> 01:01:11,689
[SPEAKER_05]: She was going to write a story for which she did write a story that talked about the Lawrence Memorial Hospital, A, an auditing report on their executive salaries, and B, an auditing report on their expenses, profit and loss.

672
01:01:12,509 --> 01:01:19,173
[SPEAKER_05]: When she submitted that to her editor, the editor said, no, no, no, because the pushback came from the Lawrence Memorial Hospital.

673
01:01:19,793 --> 01:01:25,698
[SPEAKER_05]: So, if you really think that this Medford newspaper is giving you the right information, think again.

674
01:01:26,298 --> 01:01:46,753
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe many of the employees are doing the right thing, but it's quite obvious that the people who are running the Lawrence Memorial Hospital, all these executives that are getting paid hundreds and thousands and millions of dollars during the course of a year, if they can control the newspaper to try to control the people that read the newspaper, that that's what's going into the newspaper, it's going to be the right thing for the city of Medford

675
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:48,031
[SPEAKER_05]: then we're all crazy.

676
01:01:48,331 --> 01:01:48,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

677
01:01:49,092 --> 01:01:50,553
[SPEAKER_05]: Please hold your ground.

678
01:01:50,593 --> 01:01:55,437
[SPEAKER_05]: This is your time to hold your ground in behalf of the taxpayers of this community.

679
01:01:55,637 --> 01:01:56,097
[SPEAKER_05]: I thank you.

680
01:02:06,405 --> 01:02:08,547
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi.

681
01:02:10,909 --> 01:02:12,230
[SPEAKER_08]: My name's Eileen Ginnity.

682
01:02:12,310 --> 01:02:16,353
[SPEAKER_08]: I live on Governor's Ave in Medford and I want to thank, um,

683
01:02:16,989 --> 01:02:24,793
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Knight, because in January at our meeting, he made sure to request at the end that we had this month or five-week follow-up.

684
01:02:24,993 --> 01:02:27,774
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think these kind of follow-ups are so important.

685
01:02:28,535 --> 01:02:38,420
[SPEAKER_08]: And I also may have missed some of the update, because when the blower goes on, it is really hard to hear back there.

686
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:44,823
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm not sure it was going to be on the update tonight from the Melrose-Wakefield people.

687
01:02:45,753 --> 01:02:55,297
[SPEAKER_08]: At the last meeting here at City Council, Vice President Lungo Coyne, among other things, said we would like some information about the ownership structure.

688
01:02:56,057 --> 01:02:59,819
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't believe anything of that nature was presented tonight.

689
01:03:00,519 --> 01:03:05,481
[SPEAKER_08]: And I guess I would just like to say, let's not lose track of that piece of information.

690
01:03:05,541 --> 01:03:13,704
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that that has a lot of spokes coming off of it, like revenues, taxes, and things that are important to the city in that way, but I really

691
01:03:14,195 --> 01:03:22,941
[SPEAKER_08]: We know there are three major groups of partners, but I think people must be much more at a more formalized point that they can speak to us about that.

692
01:03:28,384 --> 01:03:41,152
[SPEAKER_08]: In an email with Lori, I heard that the survey for neighbors or interested city people would be hopefully coming up by the end of this week.

693
01:03:42,167 --> 01:03:43,268
[SPEAKER_08]: And is that on track?

694
01:03:43,648 --> 01:03:46,069
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, I hadn't heard if that was in the update.

695
01:03:46,370 --> 01:03:46,750
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

696
01:03:47,530 --> 01:03:51,973
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's a survey coming out, I guess, for any citizen to respond to.

697
01:03:59,798 --> 01:04:03,540
[SPEAKER_08]: There's one thing I asked, and I think people are still trying to get the information.

698
01:04:03,580 --> 01:04:08,103
[SPEAKER_08]: But at the meeting in January, and then with my email, I asked whether they could give

699
01:04:09,375 --> 01:04:12,217
[SPEAKER_08]: the square footage of the nursing school building.

700
01:04:12,297 --> 01:04:27,304
[SPEAKER_08]: So just in comparison to a 17,500 one-story building that will be like in front of it, could we just have an idea of, I just aesthetically and neighborhood-wise want to have an idea of where that is in the drawings.

701
01:04:28,245 --> 01:04:29,746
[SPEAKER_08]: The new building looks much bigger.

702
01:04:29,786 --> 01:04:32,027
[SPEAKER_08]: It may in fact just hide the whole nursing school.

703
01:04:32,067 --> 01:04:32,447
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

704
01:04:32,487 --> 01:04:38,470
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just looking for that information on the square footage of the nursing school to compare to the

705
01:04:38,803 --> 01:04:42,205
[SPEAKER_08]: proposed square footage of the ambulatory services center.

706
01:04:42,665 --> 01:04:47,328
[SPEAKER_08]: That must be in a blueprint somewhere that people can get.

707
01:04:47,348 --> 01:04:55,534
[SPEAKER_16]: Just so we can all hear.

708
01:04:56,734 --> 01:04:58,375
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, I was pulling up my phone.

709
01:04:58,395 --> 01:05:03,138
[SPEAKER_14]: The gross square footage for the residence hall is 23,000 square feet, and the classroom is just under 9,000.

710
01:05:03,198 --> 01:05:04,579
[SPEAKER_14]: So a total of around 33,000 square feet.

711
01:05:06,762 --> 01:05:07,422
[SPEAKER_14]: It's two buildings.

712
01:05:08,362 --> 01:05:17,744
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a residence hall, which is the higher structure, and then the classroom, which is the two-story structure.

713
01:05:17,764 --> 01:05:17,984
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry.

714
01:05:18,264 --> 01:05:19,604
[SPEAKER_14]: In the residence hall, no one lives there.

715
01:05:19,624 --> 01:05:20,344
[SPEAKER_14]: It's an old name.

716
01:05:21,545 --> 01:05:22,945
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

717
01:05:22,965 --> 01:05:24,165
[SPEAKER_14]: The classroom is where?

718
01:05:24,185 --> 01:05:33,907
[SPEAKER_14]: The classroom is just a tad under 9,000.

719
01:05:33,967 --> 01:05:36,147
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's really all the particular

720
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:38,101
[SPEAKER_08]: factual stuff I wanted to bring up.

721
01:05:38,161 --> 01:05:42,543
[SPEAKER_08]: But I did hear Ryan talked about escalating costs.

722
01:05:42,623 --> 01:05:48,566
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's the first maybe a lot of people are hearing about that, escalating costs due to extended time.

723
01:05:50,487 --> 01:05:54,349
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you're not ready to give detail on that, but that concerns me.

724
01:05:55,309 --> 01:05:57,310
[SPEAKER_08]: And it sort of concerns me for several reasons.

725
01:05:57,410 --> 01:06:04,734
[SPEAKER_08]: One is at the very first meeting and from I've been at every single meeting, big, small, city council, drop-in, every single meeting,

726
01:06:06,073 --> 01:06:13,179
[SPEAKER_08]: it was always that we can't retrofit and reuse the hospital because it will cost us an additional $3 million.

727
01:06:14,380 --> 01:06:27,091
[SPEAKER_08]: So I certainly hope the escalating costs are not going to be around $3 million or more, because think of all the time and angst and neighborhood worry that would have been spent on this.

728
01:06:28,172 --> 01:06:33,377
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would think that escalating costs, I guess, are getting presented at some future date.

729
01:06:34,592 --> 01:06:40,216
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all I want to say factually, but I just want to say I wasn't I Also wasn't going to come tonight.

730
01:06:40,276 --> 01:06:41,737
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been to every single meeting.

731
01:06:42,097 --> 01:06:57,547
[SPEAKER_08]: I've emailed people I've Tried to keep up to date and then my neighbor miss mescal of retired school teacher who we are so happy lucky to have as our neighbor said we should go so I picked her up and we came and I wasn't gonna come because like I

732
01:06:58,946 --> 01:07:00,707
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Penter, I feel like it's a done deal.

733
01:07:00,967 --> 01:07:08,109
[SPEAKER_08]: And you get to a point in your life, you know, you have a lot of other things to worry about, family, your job, you're paying your taxes.

734
01:07:08,129 --> 01:07:09,609
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's like, it's a done deal.

735
01:07:10,310 --> 01:07:13,851
[SPEAKER_08]: CEO Sandberg comes there and she knows what she's doing and Ram ruts through.

736
01:07:13,951 --> 01:07:20,173
[SPEAKER_08]: And I emailed the mayor to say, will the ambulatory service center go 24-7 now that the air is closing?

737
01:07:20,213 --> 01:07:23,634
[SPEAKER_08]: And the mayor wrote back and said, no, I wish they had decided to.

738
01:07:27,603 --> 01:07:29,704
[SPEAKER_08]: But where is it?

739
01:07:29,864 --> 01:07:31,464
[SPEAKER_08]: So I may come.

740
01:07:31,605 --> 01:07:33,225
[SPEAKER_08]: I hopefully will come again to other meetings.

741
01:07:33,285 --> 01:07:34,446
[SPEAKER_08]: But I wasn't going to come tonight.

742
01:07:35,146 --> 01:07:41,608
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's important as neighbors we stay together and protect our neighborhood and do what's right and not be difficult.

743
01:07:41,648 --> 01:07:45,230
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think neighbors are being difficult or asking too much.

744
01:07:45,250 --> 01:07:46,030
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

745
01:07:46,990 --> 01:07:47,310
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

746
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:08,182
[SPEAKER_10]: Janet Dietrich, 38 Hutchins Road.

747
01:08:09,823 --> 01:08:23,572
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, I was thinking when I was writing all these notes, which they're a mess so they're not in order, when the hospital was the hospital and doctors made rounds, they did not

748
01:08:24,355 --> 01:08:27,236
[SPEAKER_10]: Majority did not have offices in the hospital.

749
01:08:27,997 --> 01:08:31,659
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, this group is saying, the ASC, oh, it's going to be great.

750
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:36,981
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to have the surgeries here, and then the doctors can go over to the medical building to see their patients.

751
01:08:38,242 --> 01:08:40,323
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's not serving anybody.

752
01:08:40,503 --> 01:08:41,463
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't have to.

753
01:08:42,044 --> 01:08:44,225
[SPEAKER_10]: The surgeons are doing their surgeries.

754
01:08:45,245 --> 01:08:50,888
[SPEAKER_10]: They're saving the doctors a trip from New England Medical Center to go to the hospital to make rounds.

755
01:08:51,580 --> 01:08:57,965
[SPEAKER_10]: So they say outpatient when they go in for surgery, and they say outpatient, we'll go over and see them.

756
01:08:58,486 --> 01:08:59,687
[SPEAKER_10]: No, the people are going home.

757
01:08:59,987 --> 01:09:02,889
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going over to see their appointments that were made.

758
01:09:03,470 --> 01:09:13,217
[SPEAKER_10]: Why can't this ASC be put on public property and let them go from surgeries up to the hospital to see their patients just like doctors have always done?

759
01:09:14,018 --> 01:09:16,500
[SPEAKER_10]: The ASC does not need to be on the hospital property.

760
01:09:17,646 --> 01:09:20,567
[SPEAKER_10]: you need to find property in the city that it can go on.

761
01:09:20,968 --> 01:09:24,449
[SPEAKER_10]: And then they could still have the medical building for their offices.

762
01:09:26,110 --> 01:09:27,071
[SPEAKER_10]: That's just one point.

763
01:09:27,091 --> 01:09:34,794
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

764
01:09:38,756 --> 01:09:39,336
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, OK.

765
01:09:41,637 --> 01:09:44,719
[SPEAKER_10]: With transportation and parking garage,

766
01:09:45,577 --> 01:09:49,399
[SPEAKER_10]: There's numerous Mass Bay Transportation Authority bus lines.

767
01:09:50,079 --> 01:09:54,100
[SPEAKER_10]: We have number 80, 94, 95, 96, 99, 100, 101, 108, and 134.

768
01:09:54,721 --> 01:09:56,741
[SPEAKER_10]: Who knew?

769
01:09:56,862 --> 01:09:58,082
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't know until I looked this up.

770
01:09:58,662 --> 01:10:02,244
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, so that's a lot of people coming and going and traffic with the buses.

771
01:10:03,644 --> 01:10:08,126
[SPEAKER_10]: The bus lines to Wellington are 90, 97, 106, 110, and 112.

772
01:10:08,346 --> 01:10:13,068
[SPEAKER_10]: The east side of Method is Wellington Station, the orange line.

773
01:10:13,522 --> 01:10:19,307
[SPEAKER_10]: The west side of Medford is the Lowell commuter rail line stops in the west Medford Square.

774
01:10:19,767 --> 01:10:24,912
[SPEAKER_10]: So you have people coming from, you know, going from Boston up to Lowell.

775
01:10:26,273 --> 01:10:29,916
[SPEAKER_10]: The Green Line extension will bring the Green Line into Medford.

776
01:10:30,616 --> 01:10:31,577
[SPEAKER_10]: It's under construction.

777
01:10:31,777 --> 01:10:38,723
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll follow the Lowell commuter rail tracks ending near Tufts University intersection, Boston Ave and College Ave.

778
01:10:41,294 --> 01:10:46,437
[SPEAKER_10]: A further extension to Mystic Valley Parkway, Route 16, is under environmental review.

779
01:10:47,417 --> 01:10:48,098
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't know that.

780
01:10:50,439 --> 01:10:52,680
[SPEAKER_10]: You also have the Joseph Limousine.

781
01:10:54,101 --> 01:10:58,784
[SPEAKER_10]: You have Interstate 93 from north to south through the city.

782
01:10:59,484 --> 01:11:03,666
[SPEAKER_10]: State routes passing through Method include Routes 16, 28, 38, and 60.

783
01:11:04,867 --> 01:11:09,830
[SPEAKER_10]: And we are now hearing that Hallmark Health is looking into the MBTA

784
01:11:10,417 --> 01:11:15,659
[SPEAKER_10]: and a route to the hospital, maybe Forest Street to Lawrence Road, Winthrop Street to Lawrence Road.

785
01:11:16,300 --> 01:11:18,401
[SPEAKER_10]: And I believe that is not for the ASC.

786
01:11:18,481 --> 01:11:20,762
[SPEAKER_10]: That's gonna be for the appointments at the medical building.

787
01:11:22,322 --> 01:11:23,843
[SPEAKER_10]: We cannot take a chance with this.

788
01:11:24,383 --> 01:11:26,144
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a business they have.

789
01:11:26,444 --> 01:11:27,745
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't care about the community.

790
01:11:29,366 --> 01:11:30,666
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a Boston invasion.

791
01:11:31,447 --> 01:11:33,107
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a small New England medical center.

792
01:11:35,248 --> 01:11:36,649
[SPEAKER_10]: They can move it to another place.

793
01:11:39,163 --> 01:11:43,511
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, urgent care, they have the elderly brainwashed.

794
01:11:44,032 --> 01:11:49,342
[SPEAKER_10]: They think, oh, the emergency room is going, but urgent care is going to be open from 7 to 11.

795
01:11:49,843 --> 01:11:50,844
[SPEAKER_10]: But they don't understand.

796
01:11:53,160 --> 01:12:00,924
[SPEAKER_10]: The elderly would go up there for chest pain and such, not knowing that they don't have really anything up there to help them.

797
01:12:01,224 --> 01:12:04,485
[SPEAKER_10]: You'd still have to call an ambulance to take them to Melrose-Wakefield.

798
01:12:06,106 --> 01:12:11,228
[SPEAKER_10]: And you also have urgent care co-pay, which when I happened to go to one, it cost me $50.

799
01:12:12,668 --> 01:12:15,229
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I had to go to an ER.

800
01:12:15,289 --> 01:12:16,989
[SPEAKER_10]: They couldn't help me, and it cost me $100.

801
01:12:17,249 --> 01:12:21,611
[SPEAKER_10]: Now it's $150, and that's without an ambulance.

802
01:12:21,891 --> 01:12:27,592
[SPEAKER_10]: How much is that going to cost somebody to go from the urgent care to Melrose-Wakefield?

803
01:12:29,573 --> 01:12:32,033
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no doctor going to be there at the urgent care.

804
01:12:33,634 --> 01:12:36,775
[SPEAKER_10]: Nurse practitioners, RNs, nursing assistants.

805
01:12:37,335 --> 01:12:40,736
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, labs, they do, you heard, go out

806
01:12:41,475 --> 01:12:42,836
[SPEAKER_10]: outsourced except for a few.

807
01:12:43,516 --> 01:12:47,298
[SPEAKER_10]: X-rays, there was a pregnant woman that went there, eight months pregnant.

808
01:12:47,618 --> 01:12:48,899
[SPEAKER_10]: They couldn't do an ultrasound.

809
01:12:49,039 --> 01:12:51,401
[SPEAKER_10]: They told us she had to go to a hospital.

810
01:12:52,321 --> 01:12:59,065
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, if you see somebody pregnant and she's having questionable problems, you know, please, we can't help you right here.

811
01:12:59,725 --> 01:13:00,005
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't.

812
01:13:00,406 --> 01:13:01,926
[SPEAKER_10]: Book her in and send her out.

813
01:13:03,527 --> 01:13:06,109
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, and the other thing is the ER has closed.

814
01:13:07,014 --> 01:13:11,476
[SPEAKER_10]: What's going to happen to the urgent care when that starts to decline in the number of people going?

815
01:13:11,876 --> 01:13:17,739
[SPEAKER_10]: Because there's so many urgent cares now out there that they may need the space for more doctors.

816
01:13:18,239 --> 01:13:18,760
[SPEAKER_10]: Who knows?

817
01:13:21,861 --> 01:13:24,622
[SPEAKER_10]: And how are they going to bill for the urgent care?

818
01:13:24,763 --> 01:13:32,446
[SPEAKER_10]: There have been issues that other places have billed outpatient hospital visits, which is a lot of money.

819
01:13:33,026 --> 01:13:36,028
[SPEAKER_10]: The people are billed extra.

820
01:13:37,082 --> 01:13:39,624
[SPEAKER_10]: for going to an urgent care that's in a hospital.

821
01:13:40,664 --> 01:13:42,725
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, whatever it's called now.

822
01:13:43,766 --> 01:13:46,227
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, they have a facility fee and a doctor fee.

823
01:13:48,208 --> 01:13:49,529
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

824
01:13:51,290 --> 01:13:51,690
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

825
01:13:52,330 --> 01:13:58,654
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, ASC, Method Surgery LLC, that's the doctors that own it.

826
01:13:58,934 --> 01:14:00,495
[SPEAKER_10]: How many doctors are we talking about?

827
01:14:01,818 --> 01:14:03,099
[SPEAKER_10]: How much money are they going to pull in?

828
01:14:03,639 --> 01:14:08,783
[SPEAKER_10]: They were saying 30,000 procedures are going to be done in this ASC.

829
01:14:09,563 --> 01:14:12,125
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, I talked to a GI doctor.

830
01:14:12,746 --> 01:14:14,267
[SPEAKER_10]: He works six days a week.

831
01:14:15,007 --> 01:14:19,150
[SPEAKER_10]: And he does seven to 10 procedures a day.

832
01:14:20,231 --> 01:14:22,873
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, how are they going to divide these rooms up?

833
01:14:23,673 --> 01:14:26,235
[SPEAKER_10]: They're talking about all these doctors going to come in and do procedures?

834
01:14:26,956 --> 01:14:31,499
[SPEAKER_10]: Eventually, they're going to have to add on to bring in more outpatient

835
01:14:32,205 --> 01:14:33,826
[SPEAKER_10]: rooms to be done.

836
01:14:34,866 --> 01:14:35,606
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't know this.

837
01:14:35,626 --> 01:14:40,588
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to open this up and we're not going to know what's going to go in the medical building.

838
01:14:40,828 --> 01:14:42,148
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not telling us anything.

839
01:14:42,488 --> 01:14:43,469
[SPEAKER_10]: They know the plans.

840
01:14:43,489 --> 01:14:44,489
[SPEAKER_10]: They know what they want.

841
01:14:45,089 --> 01:14:46,990
[SPEAKER_10]: They know how many doctors are going to be involved.

842
01:14:47,850 --> 01:14:50,591
[SPEAKER_10]: It's for-profit, taxable ASC.

843
01:14:51,731 --> 01:14:54,192
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, let's see.

844
01:14:54,212 --> 01:14:57,213
[SPEAKER_10]: I told you I don't have it in order.

845
01:15:03,306 --> 01:15:07,887
[SPEAKER_10]: OK, this is a world-renowned New England Medical Center physicians.

846
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:17,669
[SPEAKER_10]: Patients will come to MedFed not from MedFed only, but from Massachusetts, also from New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine.

847
01:15:18,089 --> 01:15:19,029
[SPEAKER_10]: And you want to know why?

848
01:15:20,210 --> 01:15:20,670
[SPEAKER_10]: I did it.

849
01:15:21,990 --> 01:15:26,311
[SPEAKER_10]: My kids went to a physician at Children's Hospital for years.

850
01:15:27,491 --> 01:15:29,832
[SPEAKER_10]: Before he was at Boston, he was in Arkansas.

851
01:15:30,738 --> 01:15:36,223
[SPEAKER_10]: People from Arkansas, once a year, flew from Arkansas to Children's Hospital to see him.

852
01:15:36,843 --> 01:15:38,845
[SPEAKER_10]: Then when he left, he went to Maine.

853
01:15:39,466 --> 01:15:42,729
[SPEAKER_10]: I drove to Maine every six months because my kids had to be seen.

854
01:15:42,749 --> 01:15:44,010
[SPEAKER_10]: I drove to Maine.

855
01:15:44,490 --> 01:15:48,173
[SPEAKER_10]: So these are world-renowned medical center doctors.

856
01:15:48,694 --> 01:15:49,615
[SPEAKER_10]: People are going to do this.

857
01:15:50,275 --> 01:15:51,817
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not just Medvid residents.

858
01:15:52,757 --> 01:15:55,420
[SPEAKER_10]: We have all these other communities coming in.

859
01:16:11,393 --> 01:16:14,194
[SPEAKER_10]: Malden Hospital, it's been closed for 20 years.

860
01:16:14,835 --> 01:16:22,899
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the zoning changed, reverted back to a single zoning when it became vacant.

861
01:16:23,419 --> 01:16:34,464
[SPEAKER_10]: The city allowed Hallmark to have it vacant so that they can determine their zoning laws, which it did go back to single.

862
01:16:34,784 --> 01:16:36,345
[SPEAKER_10]: So they still don't know what's going on there.

863
01:16:37,843 --> 01:16:45,749
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, how are they going to do the school and nursing, transport them over to the Malden campus when who knows what's going to go there?

864
01:16:46,509 --> 01:16:51,433
[SPEAKER_10]: And they have been saying, oh, Lawrence Memorial employees weren't ever over there.

865
01:16:51,473 --> 01:16:52,313
[SPEAKER_10]: They never parked there.

866
01:16:52,994 --> 01:16:57,217
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Falco, President Falco, you want to know who parked in my driveway?

867
01:16:57,637 --> 01:17:00,539
[SPEAKER_10]: He worked at the Lawrence Memorial kitchen, your cousin.

868
01:17:01,222 --> 01:17:02,763
[SPEAKER_10]: He didn't want to be transported.

869
01:17:03,383 --> 01:17:05,004
[SPEAKER_10]: He did not want to be transported.

870
01:17:05,685 --> 01:17:06,725
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not aware of that.

871
01:17:07,606 --> 01:17:08,967
[SPEAKER_10]: Anthony Falco.

872
01:17:09,487 --> 01:17:10,688
[SPEAKER_10]: I call him Falco.

873
01:17:11,348 --> 01:17:21,714
[SPEAKER_10]: He parked in my driveway because he had little kids and couldn't take that silly bus over to the, wherever they go again, Malden Hospital.

874
01:17:22,374 --> 01:17:23,155
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I mean,

875
01:17:24,355 --> 01:17:26,276
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you want to say?

876
01:17:26,396 --> 01:17:28,537
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not aware of that, and I can't speak to that.

877
01:17:28,677 --> 01:17:29,337
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, I know.

878
01:17:29,377 --> 01:17:30,578
[SPEAKER_10]: But they're telling us this.

879
01:17:30,958 --> 01:17:31,578
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not.

880
01:17:31,598 --> 01:17:33,059
[SPEAKER_10]: I told them to park there.

881
01:17:33,079 --> 01:17:34,100
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, you told them to park there.

882
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:41,603
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I have a cousin who worked there that parked in my girlfriend's driveway because she didn't want to take the whatever that thing is.

883
01:17:41,703 --> 01:17:43,064
[SPEAKER_16]: Parking is definitely a concern.

884
01:17:43,264 --> 01:17:44,905
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, I know.

885
01:17:45,005 --> 01:17:45,905
[SPEAKER_16]: We're all aware of that.

886
01:17:45,945 --> 01:17:50,507
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're definitely concerned as counselors for the neighborhood with regard to parking, without a doubt.

887
01:17:50,748 --> 01:17:52,368
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yes, this is true.

888
01:17:52,408 --> 01:17:53,229
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm also hearing.

889
01:17:54,223 --> 01:17:57,425
[SPEAKER_10]: They've been saying, oh, you know, there isn't going to be a parking garage.

890
01:17:57,465 --> 01:17:58,926
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, oh, we're not going to do that.

891
01:17:59,226 --> 01:18:00,907
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, yeah, not up at the ASC.

892
01:18:01,248 --> 01:18:02,989
[SPEAKER_10]: We've been thinking ASC.

893
01:18:03,289 --> 01:18:07,652
[SPEAKER_10]: They're planning on putting one in the emergency room parking lot, a garage.

894
01:18:09,173 --> 01:18:11,454
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, well, this is what they're thinking.

895
01:18:11,514 --> 01:18:13,976
[SPEAKER_10]: That hasn't been presented to us.

896
01:18:14,977 --> 01:18:15,637
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I know.

897
01:18:15,717 --> 01:18:16,778
[SPEAKER_10]: I went down to the...

898
01:18:17,545 --> 01:18:20,928
[SPEAKER_10]: Who was it, the building or somebody down there at City Hall?

899
01:18:21,148 --> 01:18:25,351
[SPEAKER_10]: He told me to check in every two weeks, because he can't believe he hasn't heard from them.

900
01:18:27,413 --> 01:18:38,782
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, I want to know the curbing, the nice curbing that they put along Governor Zav's Island, going from the entrance to the hospital up to my street.

901
01:18:40,564 --> 01:18:42,325
[SPEAKER_10]: Hutchins Road, isn't that funny?

902
01:18:42,655 --> 01:18:45,296
[SPEAKER_10]: Hutchins Road, where Anthony Falco parked in my driveway.

903
01:18:46,457 --> 01:18:48,438
[SPEAKER_10]: And I want to know who paid for that.

904
01:18:48,538 --> 01:18:50,679
[SPEAKER_10]: Because they didn't go all the way up Governor's Ave.

905
01:18:51,080 --> 01:19:00,545
[SPEAKER_10]: They only stopped from point A to point B. You know, if these people are going to be bringing this into our neighborhood, they should do all the way up Governor's Ave and make it look pretty.

906
01:19:02,478 --> 01:19:11,291
[SPEAKER_10]: And with the parking, too, it's not going to just be employees and nursing students that are going to park on the streets.

907
01:19:11,752 --> 01:19:15,037
[SPEAKER_10]: Patients are going to be parking on the streets because they're not going to have anywhere to park.

908
01:19:16,419 --> 01:19:17,340
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't stop them.

909
01:19:19,161 --> 01:19:25,745
[SPEAKER_10]: And security, they did years ago have security in the parking area.

910
01:19:26,166 --> 01:19:27,266
[SPEAKER_10]: There hasn't been in years.

911
01:19:27,947 --> 01:19:29,088
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, they put flyers up.

912
01:19:29,108 --> 01:19:31,449
[SPEAKER_10]: You know how you lose your dog, somebody takes your dog?

913
01:19:33,110 --> 01:19:40,095
[SPEAKER_10]: A doctor, somebody took his 10-speed mountain bike that cost like $600 off the back of his car while he was working.

914
01:19:40,455 --> 01:19:41,295
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's crazy.

915
01:19:41,616 --> 01:19:46,098
[SPEAKER_10]: All these people that just come into our neighborhood, and we don't know who they are.

916
01:19:47,319 --> 01:19:48,480
[SPEAKER_10]: You people need to help us.

917
01:19:49,551 --> 01:19:51,913
[SPEAKER_10]: You need to block this because it's undetermined.

918
01:19:52,294 --> 01:19:53,194
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just open.

919
01:19:53,515 --> 01:19:54,796
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not saying anything.

920
01:19:55,296 --> 01:20:00,241
[SPEAKER_10]: If you allow the ASC, who knows what's going to go into the medical building?

921
01:20:01,462 --> 01:20:04,364
[SPEAKER_10]: And the hospital, like Mr. Penta said, it's not a hospital.

922
01:20:04,785 --> 01:20:12,692
[SPEAKER_10]: The hospital name, like I've said from the get-go, has to be torn away off the building, off the highways, because people

923
01:20:13,392 --> 01:20:14,112
[SPEAKER_10]: for what, since 1929?

924
01:20:14,852 --> 01:20:16,373
[SPEAKER_10]: No, that was a hospital.

925
01:20:16,733 --> 01:20:18,954
[SPEAKER_10]: And they are still going to go there to the emergency room.

926
01:20:18,974 --> 01:20:19,974
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not going to be open.

927
01:20:20,494 --> 01:20:28,457
[SPEAKER_10]: And we don't want what happened in the Somerville ER, you know, with a girl on a bench, dead, because she couldn't get into the emergency room.

928
01:20:29,037 --> 01:20:29,417
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay?

929
01:20:30,498 --> 01:20:32,718
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that's it for now, because my notes are a mess.

930
01:20:33,759 --> 01:20:36,360
[SPEAKER_10]: And you are going to have more meetings.

931
01:20:37,180 --> 01:20:37,680
[SPEAKER_16]: Of course, yes.

932
01:20:37,995 --> 01:20:39,496
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, before you make any decisions.

933
01:20:39,716 --> 01:20:42,037
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, we have a standing monthly meeting.

934
01:20:42,737 --> 01:20:46,178
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, and also, monthly meeting, not on vacation.

935
01:20:47,058 --> 01:20:48,959
[SPEAKER_10]: April vacation, we better not be coming here.

936
01:20:49,319 --> 01:20:57,362
[SPEAKER_10]: It always seems that these people book it either too early, because people are at work, or a vacation, or a holiday.

937
01:20:58,083 --> 01:21:03,245
[SPEAKER_10]: And the transcript, they post, oh, you've got to go there for the health department.

938
01:21:03,445 --> 01:21:06,286
[SPEAKER_10]: It comes in the transcript a week after.

939
01:21:07,999 --> 01:21:10,140
[SPEAKER_16]: Point of information, Councilor DelaRusso.

940
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:17,162
[SPEAKER_19]: Let it be known that I moved to cancel both this week's meeting and the meeting during school week in April.

941
01:21:17,542 --> 01:21:18,903
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor DelaRusso.

942
01:21:19,463 --> 01:21:20,604
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, thank you.

943
01:21:21,264 --> 01:21:22,664
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, okay.

944
01:21:25,545 --> 01:21:26,166
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll back you.

945
01:21:27,086 --> 01:21:29,787
[SPEAKER_10]: And maybe you could park in my driveway with Anthony Falco.

946
01:21:32,529 --> 01:21:32,991
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, okay.

947
01:21:33,613 --> 01:21:35,078
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, I would have served lunch.

948
01:21:36,041 --> 01:21:38,269
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, I think that's it for now.

949
01:21:39,133 --> 01:21:39,853
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'll be back.

950
01:21:39,953 --> 01:21:40,714
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

951
01:21:41,134 --> 01:21:41,874
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

952
01:21:42,134 --> 01:21:43,295
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, it's also funny.

953
01:21:43,655 --> 01:21:49,957
[SPEAKER_10]: When I went down to City Hall, just to let you know, I walked into the city clerk's office asking about something.

954
01:21:49,997 --> 01:21:54,639
[SPEAKER_10]: And the man, I think that whoever he is, the head came out and said, hi, Janet.

955
01:21:54,659 --> 01:21:56,000
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't even know who he was.

956
01:21:56,060 --> 01:21:57,060
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, it was you.

957
01:21:57,300 --> 01:21:59,681
[SPEAKER_10]: Adam, I see your name there.

958
01:22:00,082 --> 01:22:01,862
[SPEAKER_10]: I was surprised he remembered me.

959
01:22:01,982 --> 01:22:02,503
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Adam.

960
01:22:02,523 --> 01:22:03,803
[SPEAKER_10]: You scared me, but thank you.

961
01:22:04,323 --> 01:22:05,624
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'll be down.

962
01:22:06,304 --> 01:22:07,445
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, soon.

963
01:22:08,145 --> 01:22:08,385
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye.

964
01:22:08,465 --> 01:22:14,970
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

965
01:22:15,590 --> 01:22:16,251
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Carriello.

966
01:22:16,571 --> 01:22:21,674
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, maybe if the gentleman from the hospital might want to address some of the concerns that were made this evening.

967
01:22:28,038 --> 01:22:30,820
[SPEAKER_14]: So we appreciate all the comments that have been made.

968
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:33,682
[SPEAKER_14]: We strive to be a good neighbor.

969
01:22:34,178 --> 01:22:37,399
[SPEAKER_14]: a good neighbor to everyone who spoke tonight.

970
01:22:38,060 --> 01:22:41,501
[SPEAKER_14]: And we are committed to continue to engage.

971
01:22:42,141 --> 01:22:44,782
[SPEAKER_14]: We have voluntarily put forth and always come here.

972
01:22:44,802 --> 01:22:46,923
[SPEAKER_14]: We will continue to come here and provide updates.

973
01:22:46,963 --> 01:22:48,644
[SPEAKER_14]: We will continue to have our butter meetings.

974
01:22:49,124 --> 01:22:52,245
[SPEAKER_14]: Our email address is open for questions and answers.

975
01:22:52,305 --> 01:22:54,766
[SPEAKER_14]: We want to address any questions that people have.

976
01:22:55,547 --> 01:22:59,628
[SPEAKER_14]: And we are committed to continuing our engagement process.

977
01:23:00,169 --> 01:23:02,750
[SPEAKER_14]: And we take the comments to heart.

978
01:23:03,530 --> 01:23:04,270
[SPEAKER_14]: that were made today.

979
01:23:05,210 --> 01:23:08,631
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's some of the work that our team, our experts are working on right now.

980
01:23:08,811 --> 01:23:10,311
[SPEAKER_09]: I think a couple of questions are asking.

981
01:23:10,371 --> 01:23:14,692
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, one of the big concerns was, is there going to be a bus line going up there?

982
01:23:14,792 --> 01:23:19,673
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you made inquiries to the MBTA about putting a bus in there?

983
01:23:19,913 --> 01:23:21,153
[SPEAKER_09]: No one from hospital leadership has.

984
01:23:21,693 --> 01:23:24,874
[SPEAKER_09]: And what about another concern was the parking garage.

985
01:23:25,574 --> 01:23:28,894
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there plans for a parking garage down in the future of this building?

986
01:23:31,055 --> 01:23:32,855
[SPEAKER_14]: So I thought this question might come.

987
01:23:33,485 --> 01:23:39,871
[SPEAKER_14]: The revalidation of Lawrence Memorial Hospital campus will allow us to continue providing high quality, convenient care that Medford residents need.

988
01:23:40,471 --> 01:23:47,977
[SPEAKER_14]: We have undertaken a thoughtful process to build this vision, including consideration of many factors of current and future services at the campus related to parking.

989
01:23:48,978 --> 01:23:55,784
[SPEAKER_14]: For example, we consider the average number of patients, visitors, employees, and the duration of their visit, as well as other activities on campus to ensure adequate parking.

990
01:23:57,845 --> 01:24:00,928
[SPEAKER_14]: Our study of this issue indicates there is no need for a parking garage on site.

991
01:24:01,305 --> 01:24:07,628
[SPEAKER_14]: The best assurance I can give you is that the fact there is a robust city approval process for any future development on this site, as the ASC has shown.

992
01:24:08,688 --> 01:24:13,391
[SPEAKER_09]: I think what some of the people are looking for is an assurance that there won't be a garage there in the future.

993
01:24:16,152 --> 01:24:17,673
[SPEAKER_14]: Not able to give that assurance right now.

994
01:24:17,693 --> 01:24:25,717
[SPEAKER_14]: The best thing I can do is that the robust city approval process for any type of that development, as this ASC project has shown.

995
01:24:29,738 --> 01:24:30,679
[SPEAKER_14]: We look forward to coming back.

996
01:24:32,487 --> 01:24:32,767
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

997
01:24:33,328 --> 01:24:33,848
[SPEAKER_16]: Counselor Knight.

998
01:24:34,768 --> 01:24:36,049
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

999
01:24:36,069 --> 01:24:37,770
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd just like to ask if Ms.

1000
01:24:37,810 --> 01:24:38,451
[SPEAKER_18]: O'Reilly and Ms.

1001
01:24:38,491 --> 01:24:47,716
[SPEAKER_18]: Minor could provide the city messenger with a copy of those criteria that they spoke of earlier in the meeting, so we can include that in the council record for tonight's proceedings.

1002
01:24:48,237 --> 01:24:54,820
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'd also ask that we reconvene in four weeks' time, Mr. President, for another monthly update.

1003
01:24:55,101 --> 01:24:55,401
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1004
01:24:55,441 --> 01:24:56,562
[SPEAKER_16]: Counselor Knight, just so you know.

1005
01:24:56,682 --> 01:25:00,624
[SPEAKER_18]: And if we have to check with Janet to see her schedule, that's fine with me, too.

1006
01:25:02,953 --> 01:25:09,539
[SPEAKER_16]: The clerk did receive an itemized list here, so what we'll do is we'll have a copy made and distribute it to everyone here.

1007
01:25:09,559 --> 01:25:09,619
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1008
01:25:10,981 --> 01:25:14,324
[SPEAKER_18]: If we could have a copy of that included in the minutes for next council meeting, I'd appreciate it.

1009
01:25:14,344 --> 01:25:19,749
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, if you could have a copy included in the minutes for the next council meeting.

1010
01:25:20,429 --> 01:25:20,630
[SPEAKER_16]: Ms.

1011
01:25:20,730 --> 01:25:25,154
[SPEAKER_16]: O'Reilly, is it possible to get a electronic copy?

1012
01:25:25,614 --> 01:25:25,895
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1013
01:25:33,652 --> 01:25:41,923
[SPEAKER_26]: So at the risk of being told that I've drank the Kool-Aid, I'm working with the hospital here and working with my neighbors.

1014
01:25:43,304 --> 01:25:44,886
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm very conflicted on this issue.

1015
01:25:45,006 --> 01:25:48,010
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't think any of us are truly happy about what's happening.

1016
01:25:48,271 --> 01:25:50,133
[SPEAKER_26]: But the hospital's not coming back.

1017
01:25:50,897 --> 01:25:53,298
[SPEAKER_26]: And I think we need to be realistic about this.

1018
01:25:53,678 --> 01:26:07,804
[SPEAKER_26]: The options are an ASC, abandonment of the property, development of condos or homes, which will be far more drilling and more disastrous to our homes, and much more construction over time.

1019
01:26:07,824 --> 01:26:12,046
[SPEAKER_26]: Or maybe a McLean's Hospital, I have no idea.

1020
01:26:13,227 --> 01:26:15,968
[SPEAKER_26]: But I think we need to be realistic about what's going to happen here.

1021
01:26:16,028 --> 01:26:20,150
[SPEAKER_26]: So I'm reluctant to push back so much that this project is abandoned.

1022
01:26:21,758 --> 01:26:27,445
[SPEAKER_26]: Again, I'm not happy, I'm very conflicted over this, but I think we need to be realistic and try and work together on this.

1023
01:26:27,465 --> 01:26:31,269
[SPEAKER_26]: I would very much like for you to work with us.

1024
01:26:31,349 --> 01:26:32,710
[SPEAKER_26]: You have some great ideas.

1025
01:26:39,638 --> 01:26:40,860
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, we'll work with you.

1026
01:26:43,832 --> 01:26:46,032
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, Mrs. O'Reilly, if you could just direct your comments to the chair.

1027
01:26:46,092 --> 01:26:49,973
[SPEAKER_26]: Absolutely, so I just wanted to say that, you know, we are a pretty strong neighborhood.

1028
01:26:50,013 --> 01:26:51,953
[SPEAKER_26]: I think we've come together through this process.

1029
01:26:52,734 --> 01:26:56,594
[SPEAKER_26]: But I want to be moving forward and not be shooting ourselves in the foot.

1030
01:26:56,614 --> 01:26:57,834
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, thank you.

1031
01:26:58,415 --> 01:27:00,855
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilman, did you have any further comments?

1032
01:27:00,895 --> 01:27:04,016
[SPEAKER_17]: Just that we can reconvene in four weeks' time, Mr. President, for a further update.

1033
01:27:04,056 --> 01:27:05,376
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1034
01:27:06,356 --> 01:27:10,537
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion to reconvene in one month, Vice President Longo Kern.

1035
01:27:10,657 --> 01:27:11,257
[SPEAKER_03]: Just briefly.

1036
01:27:12,373 --> 01:27:17,735
[SPEAKER_03]: the hospitals being a much better neighbor than maybe they were in the summer, and there is some transparency.

1037
01:27:18,495 --> 01:27:30,398
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing that really stands out to me and that really would be helpful for the community, and I think it's something that us counselors as well as the city and the neighbors need to digest, is that parking study.

1038
01:27:30,518 --> 01:27:39,801
[SPEAKER_03]: So I respectfully ask that that parking study be released prior to any permitting package being submitted to the

1039
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:44,403
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that is something that is so extremely important.

1040
01:27:44,503 --> 01:27:50,146
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something that every single resident, neighbor, community member has mentioned and is concerned about.

1041
01:27:50,546 --> 01:27:54,809
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something that we need to digest and review, and I'm going to take the time to do it.

1042
01:27:54,889 --> 01:28:00,713
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't want it to be submitted to the city, come to us the next week, and be a rush.

1043
01:28:01,133 --> 01:28:03,275
[SPEAKER_03]: That is something that really needs to come out.

1044
01:28:04,336 --> 01:28:05,817
[SPEAKER_03]: You have a parking study that's done.

1045
01:28:05,937 --> 01:28:17,426
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no reason to hold it off another three months when the people could be reviewing it now and coming up with ideas and concerns and a list of questions and trying to create a resolution now.

1046
01:28:17,827 --> 01:28:19,568
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's my last and final comment.

1047
01:28:19,848 --> 01:28:21,990
[SPEAKER_03]: That is something that needs to be done.

1048
01:28:22,010 --> 01:28:24,232
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really hope that we get a copy of that study.

1049
01:28:25,012 --> 01:28:26,514
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Vice President Longo-Kern.

1050
01:28:27,074 --> 01:28:27,795
[SPEAKER_16]: Counselor Marks.

1051
01:28:28,996 --> 01:28:29,936
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1052
01:28:29,996 --> 01:28:31,998
[SPEAKER_11]: While we have representatives from the hospital here,

1053
01:28:32,707 --> 01:28:37,568
[SPEAKER_11]: I had a question regarding interaction with the Meffitt Fire Department.

1054
01:28:38,909 --> 01:28:51,652
[SPEAKER_11]: Has there been any on-site meetings with the Meffitt Fire Department in regards to the placement of your ambulatory care building and where it's situated in comparison to the nursing school?

1055
01:28:55,133 --> 01:28:56,873
[SPEAKER_14]: Not aware of any on-site meetings.

1056
01:28:57,133 --> 01:29:01,054
[SPEAKER_14]: We have received the feedback from the fire department specifically.

1057
01:29:01,841 --> 01:29:25,741
[SPEAKER_14]: The site location that we had we are proposing or have been proposing and we're taking that feedback into consideration now That's one of the serious Factors that I described that the team is looking at in addition to the community feedback in the overall budget concerns But there have been no on-site meetings specifically for this But we have heard for feedback and what look our experts are looking at ways to address that Is it fair to say that there's a concern?

1058
01:29:26,482 --> 01:29:28,744
[SPEAKER_11]: by the method fire department relative to the

1059
01:29:29,558 --> 01:29:36,104
[SPEAKER_11]: the placement of the ambulatory surgical center in front of a building that may not be sprinkled up to code?

1060
01:29:37,886 --> 01:29:40,548
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll certainly let the experts address that.

1061
01:29:41,169 --> 01:29:47,215
[SPEAKER_14]: There were some of the feedback had been access to the School of Nursing building.

1062
01:29:48,788 --> 01:29:52,769
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that something you can share with us, or is that something that?

1063
01:29:53,329 --> 01:29:59,571
[SPEAKER_14]: The extent that I know is there are concerns around access to that building because of where the ASC is proposed.

1064
01:29:59,631 --> 01:30:05,933
[SPEAKER_14]: And they're looking at ways to, the best way to, our teams are looking at the best way to mitigate that in a multitude of ways.

1065
01:30:06,273 --> 01:30:11,774
[SPEAKER_11]: As part of the mitigation, is it potentially possible that the building could be relocated?

1066
01:30:13,795 --> 01:30:16,016
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we're looking at all options that are on the table, so yes sir.

1067
01:30:16,276 --> 01:30:17,116
[SPEAKER_14]: So that is an option.

1068
01:30:20,959 --> 01:30:21,420
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1069
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:22,901
[SPEAKER_14]: For a multitude of reasons, but yes.

1070
01:30:26,244 --> 01:30:38,235
[SPEAKER_01]: On that topic, I actually, according to Sean, the guy who represents them, the fire chief

1071
01:30:39,304 --> 01:30:52,156
[SPEAKER_01]: said until they figure out how they can access the dormitory building of the nursing school, there's absolutely no way that building will be able to go in as it stands.

1072
01:30:53,277 --> 01:30:57,481
[SPEAKER_01]: They cannot make the turn in the back of the building with a ladder truck or a fire engine.

1073
01:30:57,501 --> 01:30:59,163
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to come up Governor's Ave.

1074
01:30:59,463 --> 01:31:04,745
[SPEAKER_01]: which is another issue that I need to talk about, because that's been going crazy for the last 18 months to two years.

1075
01:31:05,565 --> 01:31:15,629
[SPEAKER_01]: But they have to come in through the front, and a standard ladder truck and or horse truck will not reach that dormitory building from the front over the ambulatory center.

1076
01:31:16,530 --> 01:31:21,712
[SPEAKER_01]: So either they need to figure out how to get a fire hydrant back there or something.

1077
01:31:21,772 --> 01:31:22,852
[SPEAKER_01]: I really don't know what they're going to do.

1078
01:31:23,504 --> 01:31:29,369
[SPEAKER_01]: but as it sits right now and the way things are planned out and you can check with the fire chief if you want.

1079
01:31:30,290 --> 01:31:33,552
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, that, that's, that's a, that's a real concern.

1080
01:31:34,413 --> 01:31:34,693
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1081
01:31:37,135 --> 01:31:38,076
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Marks.

1082
01:31:40,038 --> 01:31:41,219
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1083
01:31:41,479 --> 01:31:50,286
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, uh, myself and council Lungo attended the neighborhood meeting last week and as part of some of the conditions that were raised by the neighborhood,

1084
01:31:51,275 --> 01:32:01,302
[SPEAKER_11]: There were a number of conditions that were raised that may not fall under the purview of the Lawrence Memorial Hospital and something we as a community could be looking into.

1085
01:32:01,322 --> 01:32:07,427
[SPEAKER_11]: I know signage was an issue on some of the roads on Joyce and Hutchins.

1086
01:32:08,568 --> 01:32:18,775
[SPEAKER_11]: There was talk about maybe resident permit parking, which would alleviate some of the concerns of people parking on those particular roads that may be employed or going to Lawrence Memorial Hospital.

1087
01:32:19,354 --> 01:32:23,676
[SPEAKER_11]: But there were a number of issues that we really don't need to wait on Lawrence Memorial.

1088
01:32:24,296 --> 01:32:37,480
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm not sure at what point we as a council can forward some of these recommendations to either the traffic commission or whether it be the mayor's office to act upon these issues, because there's no reason to wait.

1089
01:32:38,441 --> 01:32:47,584
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would ask that as part of the committee report tonight, that we formulate a response that addresses some of the conditions within the

1090
01:32:47,980 --> 01:32:55,134
[SPEAKER_11]: neighbor's concerns and start working on those immediately, things that really don't need involvement by Lawrence Memorial Hospital.

1091
01:32:56,216 --> 01:32:57,018
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1092
01:32:57,038 --> 01:32:57,879
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Counsel Marcus.

1093
01:33:03,657 --> 01:33:07,399
[SPEAKER_16]: If I may, just to clarify, are you making a resolution that we need to?

1094
01:33:07,939 --> 01:33:13,822
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it may, I don't think we should do it here on the floor, but maybe a committee of the whole meeting or a subcommittee meeting.

1095
01:33:13,902 --> 01:33:15,483
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, we can schedule a committee of the whole meeting.

1096
01:33:16,303 --> 01:33:17,664
[SPEAKER_11]: To talk about some of the conditions.

1097
01:33:17,884 --> 01:33:18,925
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, sounds good.

1098
01:33:18,965 --> 01:33:19,525
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilman Cox.

1099
01:33:19,545 --> 01:33:19,865
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1100
01:33:20,886 --> 01:33:33,052
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion of Councilman Knight, seconded by Vice President Longo-Curran, as amended by Vice President Longo-Curran, that we reconvene in one month

1101
01:33:34,465 --> 01:33:36,146
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Caviello.

1102
01:33:36,347 --> 01:33:37,728
[SPEAKER_16]: No worries.

1103
01:33:39,009 --> 01:33:39,869
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, you hit it by accident.

1104
01:33:39,889 --> 01:33:42,351
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm good, thank you.

1105
01:33:42,652 --> 01:33:43,032
[SPEAKER_16]: OK.

1106
01:33:43,372 --> 01:33:44,053
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

1107
01:33:44,073 --> 01:33:44,133
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

1108
01:33:44,673 --> 01:33:45,314
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

1109
01:33:45,894 --> 01:33:46,715
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion passes.

1110
01:33:46,735 --> 01:33:48,136
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll reconvene in one month.

1111
01:33:48,937 --> 01:33:49,277
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1112
01:33:49,617 --> 01:33:50,318
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Caviello.

1113
01:33:50,338 --> 01:33:57,024
[SPEAKER_09]: While we're on the suspension, if we could take 19-056 for a common victims license and 19-059

1114
01:34:05,579 --> 01:34:08,960
[SPEAKER_16]: Petitions, presentations, and similar papers, 19-056.

1115
01:34:16,964 --> 01:34:23,186
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Capiello, that we recess for five minutes.

1116
01:34:23,527 --> 01:34:24,307
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

1117
01:34:24,787 --> 01:34:25,507
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

1118
01:34:25,587 --> 01:34:26,588
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll take a brief recess.

1119
01:42:35,120 --> 01:42:36,421
[SPEAKER_16]: Will now reconvene the meeting.

1120
01:42:37,722 --> 01:42:39,683
[SPEAKER_16]: Please have all consulars behind the rail.

1121
01:42:41,444 --> 01:42:52,992
[SPEAKER_15]: Point of order, Mr. President.

1122
01:42:53,012 --> 01:42:53,832
[SPEAKER_15]: What item is before us?

1123
01:43:03,638 --> 01:43:16,080
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Carviello has asked, while we're under suspension, to take up 19-056, but for a common vigilance license for five guys, burgers and fries, but they are not in attendance tonight.

1124
01:43:16,460 --> 01:43:18,361
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm very disappointed, Mr. President.

1125
01:43:18,381 --> 01:43:23,581
[SPEAKER_19]: Let the record show, because that is the only fast food in which I enjoy.

1126
01:43:26,482 --> 01:43:27,822
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor.

1127
01:43:27,862 --> 01:43:29,282
[SPEAKER_16]: So is there a motion to?

1128
01:43:33,092 --> 01:43:35,093
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, is there a motion to table 9-056?

1129
01:43:35,413 --> 01:43:43,195
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to table 19-056, seconded by Councilor Caviello.

1130
01:43:43,535 --> 01:43:44,295
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

1131
01:43:44,515 --> 01:43:44,695
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

1132
01:43:44,775 --> 01:43:45,475
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

1133
01:43:46,136 --> 01:43:46,736
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion's tabled.

1134
01:43:47,536 --> 01:43:50,537
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's see, while we're under suspension,

1135
01:43:52,578 --> 01:43:55,099
[SPEAKER_16]: Is it 19059, Counselor Carviel?

1136
01:43:55,559 --> 01:43:56,399
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1137
01:43:56,599 --> 01:43:56,399
19059, 059.

1138
01:43:57,279 --> 01:44:05,941
[SPEAKER_16]: Petition to reverse signed denial by Reverend David Kilpatrick for West Medford Baptist Church, 59 Bosnav, Medford Mass.

1139
01:44:06,141 --> 01:44:11,743
[SPEAKER_16]: OCD application 2019-1 exceeds allowable size.

1140
01:44:14,704 --> 01:44:15,624
[SPEAKER_16]: Counselor Carviel?

1141
01:44:16,224 --> 01:44:16,544
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1142
01:44:17,364 --> 01:44:18,865
[SPEAKER_09]: I turn it over to the Reverend Kilpatrick.

1143
01:44:19,885 --> 01:44:20,545
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean David, yeah.

1144
01:44:21,351 --> 01:44:21,731
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1145
01:44:21,851 --> 01:44:29,094
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Reverend David Kilpatrick, senior pastor at the West Medford Baptist Church, where I've been the pastor for 25 years.

1146
01:44:30,435 --> 01:44:42,519
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm here representing the congregation and the board of trustees, seeking a special permit to replace our 70-plus-year-old lighted sign, which has outlived its usefulness.

1147
01:44:42,619 --> 01:44:47,381
[SPEAKER_06]: It's one of those signs where you have to change the individual letters.

1148
01:44:47,501 --> 01:44:49,362
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very labor-intensive.

1149
01:44:50,572 --> 01:44:54,454
[SPEAKER_06]: Even though it's a lighted sign, it's very difficult to see from the street.

1150
01:44:55,374 --> 01:44:58,576
[SPEAKER_06]: And people don't really look at those kind of signs anymore anyway.

1151
01:44:58,696 --> 01:45:08,980
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're seeking to install a state-of-the-art programmable sign that can be programmed from any laptop, anywhere, wirelessly.

1152
01:45:10,321 --> 01:45:20,025
[SPEAKER_06]: You can put all kinds of messages, not only advertising things for the church, but a lot of other groups use our building for different events.

1153
01:45:20,851 --> 01:45:28,914
[SPEAKER_06]: For example, the New England region of the NAACP is meeting there in March, a meeting that's open to the public.

1154
01:45:28,974 --> 01:45:32,636
[SPEAKER_06]: We could let the neighborhood know that they're meeting there and they're welcome to attend.

1155
01:45:33,396 --> 01:45:38,798
[SPEAKER_06]: We have all kinds of community events for children from the neighborhood.

1156
01:45:38,878 --> 01:45:41,660
[SPEAKER_06]: We could let the neighborhood know we're having those kinds of things.

1157
01:45:43,781 --> 01:45:49,363
[SPEAKER_06]: The current sign is seven feet tall, which is one foot higher than the current code calls for.

1158
01:45:50,333 --> 01:46:00,418
[SPEAKER_06]: The new sign would be 7.6 inches tall, six inches higher than the one that's there now, and would basically fit in the same footprint as the current sign.

1159
01:46:00,498 --> 01:46:04,079
[SPEAKER_06]: So there wouldn't be a lot of change to the looks.

1160
01:46:05,080 --> 01:46:16,765
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been designed in such a way, I think you have a designer's version of it in the packet that I left for each one of you, on top of the seven

1161
01:46:17,555 --> 01:46:25,557
[SPEAKER_06]: foot six inch sign will be a little finial that has a cross on it, but the sign itself is 7.6 feet high.

1162
01:46:26,738 --> 01:46:34,400
[SPEAKER_06]: And obviously it does not meet the code, so we would need a special permit in order to have that.

1163
01:46:34,580 --> 01:46:42,403
[SPEAKER_06]: As I stated in my written statement, people don't walk into small Protestant churches these days looking to become members.

1164
01:46:42,463 --> 01:46:43,923
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to market ourselves.

1165
01:46:44,666 --> 01:46:55,312
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is a great way to market ourselves in the community by letting them know what's going on in the building, not only in terms of our own activities, but various community groups that meet there.

1166
01:46:55,372 --> 01:47:04,877
[SPEAKER_06]: For example, Medford Community Housing occasionally used the building for new homeowner, new homebuyers training classes.

1167
01:47:04,957 --> 01:47:07,999
[SPEAKER_06]: We could advertise that to the neighborhood that is being held there.

1168
01:47:08,919 --> 01:47:11,961
[SPEAKER_06]: So these are the kinds of things that we'd be using the sign for.

1169
01:47:13,456 --> 01:47:15,458
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd be happy to entertain any questions you have.

1170
01:47:15,938 --> 01:47:17,640
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Reverend Kirkpatrick.

1171
01:47:17,660 --> 01:47:18,260
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much.

1172
01:47:18,581 --> 01:47:19,241
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Carriello.

1173
01:47:19,481 --> 01:47:27,068
[SPEAKER_09]: Reverend, I don't know if you knew, but on High Street at the other church over there, they have, I'm assuming this is going to be an illuminated sign?

1174
01:47:27,369 --> 01:47:37,458
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it would be similar to the one at the Evangelical Haitian Church of Somerville, which you granted a special permit to, but it will be a smaller sign than the one they have.

1175
01:47:37,958 --> 01:47:39,880
[SPEAKER_09]: You may want to talk to Mr. Bavuso.

1176
01:47:40,637 --> 01:47:48,103
[SPEAKER_09]: Because again, because when they put that sign in there, there was some neighborhood outcry about the hours of the operation and things that were on the sign.

1177
01:47:48,163 --> 01:47:50,785
[SPEAKER_09]: So I actually be cognizant of that.

1178
01:47:51,025 --> 01:47:53,547
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm well aware of that.

1179
01:47:53,567 --> 01:48:00,272
[SPEAKER_09]: But there was some neighborhood concern with the sign going on and the hours of operation on it.

1180
01:48:00,992 --> 01:48:01,332
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1181
01:48:01,953 --> 01:48:03,094
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Cabrillo.

1182
01:48:03,154 --> 01:48:04,815
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor De La Ruza.

1183
01:48:05,943 --> 01:48:07,064
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, thank you.

1184
01:48:07,204 --> 01:48:14,648
[SPEAKER_19]: I, uh, I endorse the sign and, uh, see no reason why not to grant this, uh, this, uh, special permit.

1185
01:48:15,368 --> 01:48:25,214
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, I just hope that the, uh, Reverend, uh, avails himself as Councilor Caviello suggested to some of the limitations, uh, regarding this type of sign.

1186
01:48:25,814 --> 01:48:31,798
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, the council has in the past indicated that, uh, messages can't, uh, change

1187
01:48:32,699 --> 01:48:39,283
[SPEAKER_19]: in a rapid way, but must be consistent for periods of time before that they can change.

1188
01:48:40,004 --> 01:48:46,849
[SPEAKER_19]: So, he knowing that, I move approval of this special permit.

1189
01:48:48,410 --> 01:48:51,973
[SPEAKER_16]: A motion of Consul DelaRusso to grant the special permit.

1190
01:48:52,593 --> 01:48:53,714
[SPEAKER_16]: Vice President Longo-Kern.

1191
01:48:54,595 --> 01:48:56,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, President Falco.

1192
01:48:56,916 --> 01:48:57,497
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Reverend.

1193
01:48:58,239 --> 01:49:00,420
[SPEAKER_03]: With regards to this picture, this is the prior picture.

1194
01:49:00,720 --> 01:49:01,341
[SPEAKER_03]: That's correct.

1195
01:49:01,361 --> 01:49:02,361
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the current sign.

1196
01:49:02,401 --> 01:49:03,262
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a current sign.

1197
01:49:03,342 --> 01:49:05,763
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you provided us with a picture.

1198
01:49:05,783 --> 01:49:08,725
[SPEAKER_06]: There's an architectural sketch of what the new sign would look like.

1199
01:49:09,285 --> 01:49:09,505
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1200
01:49:09,765 --> 01:49:11,526
[SPEAKER_03]: We have the design.

1201
01:49:11,546 --> 01:49:14,268
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to know, it looks like this is permanent.

1202
01:49:14,308 --> 01:49:17,990
[SPEAKER_03]: So it says West Medford Baptist Church, all are welcome.

1203
01:49:19,070 --> 01:49:20,651
[SPEAKER_06]: The top part is permanent.

1204
01:49:20,671 --> 01:49:22,732
[SPEAKER_06]: That would stay the same all the time.

1205
01:49:22,792 --> 01:49:24,433
[SPEAKER_06]: The bottom part is programmable.

1206
01:49:24,773 --> 01:49:25,854
[SPEAKER_06]: The bottom part is programmable.

1207
01:49:25,874 --> 01:49:27,735
[SPEAKER_06]: For example, you could put the date

1208
01:49:28,442 --> 01:49:31,523
[SPEAKER_06]: time and temperature on there when there's no other signs on there.

1209
01:49:32,824 --> 01:49:36,585
[SPEAKER_06]: But you can design any kind of a message to go on that.

1210
01:49:36,825 --> 01:49:38,365
[SPEAKER_03]: You can change that per the ordinance.

1211
01:49:38,606 --> 01:49:38,946
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

1212
01:49:39,066 --> 01:49:44,848
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so my question is, what colors will especially the permanent section be?

1213
01:49:44,888 --> 01:49:46,448
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we just have a black and white picture.

1214
01:49:46,468 --> 01:49:48,049
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be the colors that are there.

1215
01:49:48,369 --> 01:49:50,329
[SPEAKER_06]: It would look exactly like that on the top.

1216
01:49:50,369 --> 01:49:51,530
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's going to be black and white?

1217
01:49:52,070 --> 01:49:52,790
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's blue.

1218
01:49:53,150 --> 01:49:53,751
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's what I'm asking.

1219
01:49:53,771 --> 01:49:54,551
[SPEAKER_03]: This is black and white.

1220
01:49:55,817 --> 01:49:57,037
[SPEAKER_03]: blue with yellow letters.

1221
01:49:57,337 --> 01:49:59,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have a color copy by chance?

1222
01:50:00,498 --> 01:50:02,099
[SPEAKER_06]: The Baptist Church is in yellow.

1223
01:50:02,139 --> 01:50:05,940
[SPEAKER_06]: The West Medford is in white with a blue background.

1224
01:50:09,461 --> 01:50:11,782
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you happen to have a colored photo just so I could take a look?

1225
01:50:13,663 --> 01:50:15,463
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think it's the same one you have.

1226
01:50:15,763 --> 01:50:16,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no.

1227
01:50:16,123 --> 01:50:17,064
[SPEAKER_03]: Ours is in black and white.

1228
01:50:17,184 --> 01:50:18,324
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yours is in black and white.

1229
01:50:18,344 --> 01:50:20,205
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's why I just.

1230
01:50:20,345 --> 01:50:21,165
[SPEAKER_03]: I have one in color.

1231
01:50:21,939 --> 01:50:23,520
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know about the rest of the councils.

1232
01:50:23,560 --> 01:50:24,621
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to see it in color.

1233
01:50:29,425 --> 01:50:30,146
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

1234
01:50:31,047 --> 01:50:32,568
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the bottom will always be yellow?

1235
01:50:33,349 --> 01:50:36,111
[SPEAKER_06]: The bottom can be made any color that's programmable.

1236
01:50:38,253 --> 01:50:43,097
[SPEAKER_06]: For example, if someone designed a flyer, the flyer could be projected on that part of the sign.

1237
01:50:44,278 --> 01:50:44,338
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

1238
01:50:44,358 --> 01:50:50,063
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, giving the time of the event and a couple of details about it, that type of thing.

1239
01:50:51,619 --> 01:50:51,939
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1240
01:50:52,800 --> 01:50:54,420
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Vice President Longo-Kern.

1241
01:50:55,021 --> 01:50:55,581
[SPEAKER_16]: Counselor Knight.

1242
01:50:56,321 --> 01:50:59,182
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, I certainly have no problem with the application.

1243
01:50:59,262 --> 01:51:09,227
[SPEAKER_18]: I just ask that we attach a condition to the special permit that the approval would be attached to the applicant's preferred use, applied use, as opposed to the business address.

1244
01:51:12,048 --> 01:51:12,368
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1245
01:51:13,489 --> 01:51:14,409
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Counselor Knight.

1246
01:51:15,089 --> 01:51:15,750
[SPEAKER_16]: Counselor Marks.

1247
01:51:17,570 --> 01:51:18,511
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1248
01:51:20,347 --> 01:51:31,951
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the issues that I think Councilor Caviello was alluding to was the fact that signs that are internally illuminated can pose a concern within neighborhood settings.

1249
01:51:32,791 --> 01:51:40,794
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know the other sign that was denied that was approved by this council, we requested special conditions on the special permit.

1250
01:51:41,954 --> 01:51:47,056
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm not sure if you're willing to make that tonight, but that would be my vote for support.

1251
01:51:47,673 --> 01:51:52,015
[SPEAKER_11]: that the sign be turned off no later than 8 o'clock at night.

1252
01:51:52,675 --> 01:51:55,757
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe that was the special permit we put.

1253
01:51:56,057 --> 01:52:01,940
[SPEAKER_11]: And we could check with the city clerk, Mr. President, to see what conditions we'll put on the last sign.

1254
01:52:02,612 --> 01:52:06,993
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do know that that other sign at the other church is on 24 hours a day.

1255
01:52:07,213 --> 01:52:15,294
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, and we've called code enforcement on them between you and I, and now the whole city knows about it, but they were, they were in violation.

1256
01:52:15,534 --> 01:52:20,335
[SPEAKER_11]: And I want to make sure that we as a council are consistent when we approve these signs.

1257
01:52:21,136 --> 01:52:28,737
[SPEAKER_11]: I would prefer to sit down in the subcommittee meeting, talk about the sign, talk about the illumination, talk about hours of operation,

1258
01:52:29,968 --> 01:52:32,330
[SPEAKER_11]: and then move forward, Mr. President.

1259
01:52:32,630 --> 01:52:38,495
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's a better way of operating where this was already denied by the billing department.

1260
01:52:38,955 --> 01:52:41,897
[SPEAKER_11]: We would be happy to meet any special conditions that you have.

1261
01:52:43,098 --> 01:52:45,540
[SPEAKER_16]: So you'd like to move this to a subcommittee on science?

1262
01:52:46,500 --> 01:52:48,242
[SPEAKER_11]: Business, economic development, and science.

1263
01:52:48,662 --> 01:52:52,084
[SPEAKER_16]: There's currently a motion on the floor to approve this special permit.

1264
01:52:52,264 --> 01:52:52,885
[SPEAKER_16]: Is there a second?

1265
01:52:56,629 --> 01:52:57,289
[SPEAKER_16]: There's no second.

1266
01:53:01,031 --> 01:53:01,611
[SPEAKER_11]: To approve.

1267
01:53:01,871 --> 01:53:03,391
[SPEAKER_11]: To approve moving it.

1268
01:53:03,431 --> 01:53:09,113
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a motion on the floor by Consulate Dela Rousseau to approve the special permit and to allow the sign.

1269
01:53:09,653 --> 01:53:15,135
[SPEAKER_16]: Is there a second for that?

1270
01:53:15,455 --> 01:53:16,356
[SPEAKER_16]: To approve the sign.

1271
01:53:16,416 --> 01:53:17,096
[SPEAKER_16]: Approve the sign.

1272
01:53:17,116 --> 01:53:18,837
[SPEAKER_16]: You don't want to approve the sign?

1273
01:53:19,397 --> 01:53:19,617
[SPEAKER_16]: OK.

1274
01:53:20,437 --> 01:53:20,857
[SPEAKER_11]: Subcommittee.

1275
01:53:20,877 --> 01:53:22,098
[SPEAKER_16]: If I may, if I may.

1276
01:53:22,378 --> 01:53:25,939
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a motion on the floor by Consulate Dela Rousseau

1277
01:53:26,535 --> 01:53:32,238
[SPEAKER_16]: to approve the special permit as amended by Councilor Knight, namely Councilor Marks.

1278
01:53:34,479 --> 01:53:37,260
[SPEAKER_16]: You offer the resolution Councilor DelaRusso, it has not been seconded.

1279
01:53:37,600 --> 01:53:43,823
[SPEAKER_16]: There's also, Councilor Marks would also like to move this to the business and economics subcommittee.

1280
01:53:44,563 --> 01:53:44,883
[SPEAKER_11]: Signs.

1281
01:53:45,404 --> 01:53:45,624
[SPEAKER_11]: Signs.

1282
01:53:45,644 --> 01:53:49,565
[SPEAKER_11]: To discuss with the petitioner the conditions that we'll discuss.

1283
01:53:49,926 --> 01:53:52,947
[SPEAKER_16]: Is there a second on Councilor DelaRusso's motion?

1284
01:53:54,088 --> 01:53:55,008
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor DelaRusso, I'll mind.

1285
01:53:56,473 --> 01:54:01,857
[SPEAKER_16]: So there's no second on Consul DelaRusso's motion, so that fails.

1286
01:54:02,258 --> 01:54:09,143
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion of Consul Marks that this be moved to the Business and Economic Subcommittee, Consul Knight.

1287
01:54:11,065 --> 01:54:12,286
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1288
01:54:12,386 --> 01:54:15,749
[SPEAKER_18]: I certainly have no problem sending this to the Business and Economic Development Subcommittee.

1289
01:54:16,129 --> 01:54:23,715
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd ask that also a 90-day review be something that the subcommittee consider with pending approval as a condition, and also that

1290
01:54:24,635 --> 01:54:35,964
[SPEAKER_18]: paper 17606, which is the Evangelical Haitian Church on High Street, also be brought in to have a review.

1291
01:54:36,004 --> 01:54:37,926
[SPEAKER_18]: We had a 90-day review on that as well.

1292
01:54:37,966 --> 01:54:41,869
[SPEAKER_18]: The review never happened because they didn't illuminate the sign within the initial 90 days of permitting.

1293
01:54:42,550 --> 01:54:44,391
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think we need to do a little follow-up on that as well.

1294
01:54:45,092 --> 01:54:45,312
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1295
01:54:46,453 --> 01:54:49,315
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, on the motion of Councilor Scott Pelley.

1296
01:54:51,777 --> 01:54:57,082
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate Councillor Marks' resolution.

1297
01:54:57,122 --> 01:55:13,939
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that this is important and I'd like to see it move forward, but I think that in all fairness, with the illuminated signs being a popular trend now, I think that we have to follow the same protocol that we have in the past because I think it is important.

1298
01:55:14,672 --> 01:55:21,095
[SPEAKER_07]: And what we're seeing right now with the High Street Church, that they're in violation.

1299
01:55:21,135 --> 01:55:24,336
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it can only prove that we follow the same procedures.

1300
01:55:24,356 --> 01:55:28,158
[SPEAKER_07]: So I second Councilor Marks' resolution.

1301
01:55:28,358 --> 01:55:29,578
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1302
01:55:30,779 --> 01:55:42,743
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion of Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, that this be moved to the Business and Economic Development and Science Subcommittee, which is chaired by Councilor Marks.

1303
01:55:44,470 --> 01:55:46,892
[SPEAKER_16]: It includes Councilor DelaRusso and Councilor Scott Pelli.

1304
01:55:48,312 --> 01:55:49,013
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

1305
01:55:49,773 --> 01:55:51,755
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry, I apologize, as amended.

1306
01:55:52,335 --> 01:55:53,096
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

1307
01:55:53,556 --> 01:55:54,236
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

1308
01:55:55,017 --> 01:55:58,719
[SPEAKER_16]: This will move to the subcommittee of business and economic development and science.

1309
01:55:59,640 --> 01:56:00,440
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

1310
01:56:00,600 --> 01:56:00,920
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1311
01:56:05,503 --> 01:56:07,605
[SPEAKER_16]: A motion to revert to the regular order of business.

1312
01:56:13,439 --> 01:56:13,899
[SPEAKER_16]: Hearings.

1313
01:56:14,120 --> 01:56:17,782
[SPEAKER_16]: Notice of a public hearing 18-712.

1314
01:56:18,683 --> 01:56:19,764
[SPEAKER_16]: Notice of a public hearing.

1315
01:56:19,824 --> 01:56:21,725
[SPEAKER_16]: City of Memphis City Clerk's Office.

1316
01:56:22,986 --> 01:56:29,011
[SPEAKER_16]: The Memphis City Council will conduct a public hearing on February 19th, 2019 at 7 p.m.

1317
01:56:29,751 --> 01:56:38,418
[SPEAKER_16]: in the Howard F. Alden Memorial Auditorium on the second floor of Memphis City Hall at 85 George P. Hassett Drive, Memphis, Massachusetts to amend Chapter 94 zoning.

1318
01:56:40,145 --> 01:56:44,607
[SPEAKER_16]: to create an Inclusionary Housing Special Permit Ordinance.

1319
01:56:45,468 --> 01:57:02,997
[SPEAKER_16]: The purpose is to create housing affordable to low and moderate income households by requiring any development constructing 10 or more residential units to receive a special permit and provide the following percentages of affordable units.

1320
01:57:03,905 --> 01:57:04,606
[SPEAKER_16]: 10 to 24 units, 10%.

1321
01:57:04,986 --> 01:57:05,386
[SPEAKER_16]: 25 to 49 units, 13%.

1322
01:57:05,426 --> 01:57:06,367
[SPEAKER_16]: 50 or more units, 15%.

1323
01:57:07,047 --> 01:57:08,288
[SPEAKER_16]: Let me say that again.

1324
01:57:08,308 --> 01:57:08,968
[SPEAKER_16]: 10 to 24 units, 10%.

1325
01:57:09,008 --> 01:57:09,348
[SPEAKER_16]: 25 to 49 units, 13%.

1326
01:57:09,388 --> 01:57:09,949
[SPEAKER_16]: 50 or more units, 15%.

1327
01:57:10,049 --> 01:57:15,712
[SPEAKER_16]: The proposed amendment adds definitions, conditions, and affordability requirements consistent with

1328
01:57:31,236 --> 01:57:34,118
[SPEAKER_16]: the DHCD-LIP program.

1329
01:57:34,599 --> 01:57:50,331
[SPEAKER_16]: The full amendment is available at the office of the city clerk, Medford City Hall, room 103, by order of the Medford City Council, Adam L. Hurtubise, city clerk.

1330
01:57:52,793 --> 01:57:57,957
[SPEAKER_16]: City of Medford, amendments to the revised zoning, amendments to the revised ordinance, chapter 94, zoning.

1331
01:57:59,262 --> 01:58:11,348
[SPEAKER_16]: Be it ordained by the Medford City Council of the City of Medford that the revised ordinances of the City of Medford in Chapter 94, Zoning, be further amended to establish an inclusionary housing slash special permit process.

1332
01:58:12,249 --> 01:58:17,812
[SPEAKER_16]: Add Article 8, Inclusionary Housing, 94-501 as follows.

1333
01:58:18,372 --> 01:58:20,553
[SPEAKER_16]: Section 1, Purpose and Intent.

1334
01:58:21,105 --> 01:58:27,711
[SPEAKER_16]: The purpose of this ordinance is to encourage development of new housing that is affordable to low and moderate income households.

1335
01:58:28,271 --> 01:58:37,599
[SPEAKER_16]: At a minimum, affordable housing produced through this regulation should be in compliance with the requirements set forth in General Law C40B section 20-20.

1336
01:58:37,659 --> 01:58:48,128
[SPEAKER_16]: President, motion to waive the reading and allow the Director of Community Development to give a brief synopsis as this has been discussed.

1337
01:58:51,087 --> 01:58:52,688
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor DelaRusso.

1338
01:58:53,969 --> 01:59:03,715
[SPEAKER_16]: If we could have Lauren DiLorenzo from the Office of Community Development to give us a brief synopsis of the amendments to the revised ordinance.

1339
01:59:03,755 --> 01:59:05,596
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Mr. President, members of the Council.

1340
01:59:06,256 --> 01:59:09,218
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll try not to be repetitive.

1341
01:59:10,159 --> 01:59:11,259
[SPEAKER_21]: OK, I shall.

1342
01:59:12,200 --> 01:59:18,064
[SPEAKER_21]: This is a formalization of a process that we've been using to

1343
01:59:20,910 --> 01:59:27,453
[SPEAKER_21]: require a percentage of housing units to be made affordable in accordance with a local initiative program.

1344
01:59:27,533 --> 01:59:35,797
[SPEAKER_21]: And the city council, and particularly through its zoning subcommittee, used a model from the Smart Growth Toolkit in order to develop this.

1345
01:59:36,237 --> 01:59:39,299
[SPEAKER_21]: And it follows in line with the site plan review process.

1346
01:59:39,459 --> 01:59:47,383
[SPEAKER_21]: The idea of that was, rather than creating a lengthy permitting process for development, which has been a criticism that that

1347
01:59:48,408 --> 02:00:11,119
[SPEAKER_21]: is actually a deterrent to the creation of housing, all housing in the Commonwealth, we decided, or the council decided, that they would combine the processes so that when a petitioner went for either a variance or a special permit for use from either the city council or the board of appeals, then this process would follow that special permit process.

1348
02:00:11,159 --> 02:00:13,240
[SPEAKER_21]: The hearings would be held at the same time.

1349
02:00:13,883 --> 02:00:23,126
[SPEAKER_21]: If there were no special permit from the council or variances from the Board of Appeals or special permit from the Board of Appeals, the Community Development Board would be the special permit granting authority.

1350
02:00:23,567 --> 02:00:31,390
[SPEAKER_21]: And so in this ordinance, you have, as the president has spoken, you have had basically what's pretty typical, definitional section.

1351
02:00:31,930 --> 02:00:33,891
[SPEAKER_21]: So they're modifying the definitions.

1352
02:00:34,511 --> 02:00:40,393
[SPEAKER_21]: You have basically the requirements, what constitutes a covered project, what projects will be subject to this requirement.

1353
02:00:41,563 --> 02:00:50,872
[SPEAKER_21]: And the president did go over those thresholds, which is basically the threshold of 10 units or more, whether they be in construction of housing or they be a subdivision, lots of plans.

1354
02:00:51,913 --> 02:00:54,816
[SPEAKER_21]: And the program would follow the local initiative program.

1355
02:00:54,836 --> 02:00:56,038
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, why do we choose that?

1356
02:00:56,598 --> 02:01:03,425
[SPEAKER_21]: That program goes up to 80% median income or less, and those units that follow those guidelines,

1357
02:01:03,898 --> 02:01:16,662
[SPEAKER_21]: This is separate than a Chapter 40B covered project, which would have some kind of state assistance in it and would have a greater percentage of affordability in order for them to follow the special requirements that projects under 40B can follow.

1358
02:01:16,902 --> 02:01:21,083
[SPEAKER_21]: So these are projects that are really done as you've seen in Medford with the market rate projects.

1359
02:01:21,883 --> 02:01:26,785
[SPEAKER_21]: And the reason why we really want to capture those units is because we can add them to the subsidized housing inventory.

1360
02:01:27,325 --> 02:01:28,905
[SPEAKER_21]: And the council, I think, was pretty clear.

1361
02:01:28,965 --> 02:01:30,966
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not really just to meet a requirement

1362
02:01:31,636 --> 02:01:38,822
[SPEAKER_21]: And so that we don't have the potential for it to be projects, it's really just that we should get credit for the effort that has been given.

1363
02:01:40,763 --> 02:01:43,746
[SPEAKER_21]: And then from there, you can change it once we meet that threshold of the 10%.

1364
02:01:43,986 --> 02:01:44,746
[SPEAKER_21]: We're at about 7%.

1365
02:01:44,887 --> 02:01:51,752
[SPEAKER_21]: It's getting increasingly harder to meet the 10% because there have been so many housing units that have been built.

1366
02:01:52,473 --> 02:01:59,198
[SPEAKER_21]: And so if we can even catch up to the status quo of 10% of these units, we'll still be a bit behind.

1367
02:02:01,087 --> 02:02:05,811
[SPEAKER_21]: almost all of the housing units to be built to be affordable in order for us to actually make that 10%.

1368
02:02:06,111 --> 02:02:07,492
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's a difficult threshold to meet.

1369
02:02:07,512 --> 02:02:08,433
[SPEAKER_21]: We should try to meet that.

1370
02:02:08,753 --> 02:02:12,596
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think the council in this presentation here has that included in it.

1371
02:02:13,397 --> 02:02:19,582
[SPEAKER_21]: And, you know, there were some decisions and discussions, if you don't mind, if I speak a little bit about the subcommittee meetings.

1372
02:02:19,642 --> 02:02:22,284
[SPEAKER_21]: There were some decisions in here that's not in lieu of fee.

1373
02:02:22,564 --> 02:02:26,848
[SPEAKER_21]: The reason for that is that a developer at this time, when the market is so hot,

1374
02:02:27,747 --> 02:02:42,471
[SPEAKER_21]: has the land, has control of the land, has financing, and is able to provide units much more quickly than the city could ever if it had to acquire land on its own, construct, and then sell property or lease it out.

1375
02:02:43,011 --> 02:02:44,651
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's why there's no one in lieu of fee.

1376
02:02:44,711 --> 02:02:52,473
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, one thing that the council did talk about in the zoning subcommittee meetings were that these things can change down the road if the council so desires to do that.

1377
02:02:53,473 --> 02:02:56,294
[SPEAKER_21]: You could simply prepare an amendment and make that change.

1378
02:02:56,788 --> 02:02:57,749
[SPEAKER_21]: when you feel it's appropriate.

1379
02:02:59,690 --> 02:03:10,696
[SPEAKER_21]: So again, I went over the maximum selling price and the regulations of how it would be administered in this ordinance is given to the Community Development Board to develop the administrative rules and procedures.

1380
02:03:12,177 --> 02:03:12,477
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1381
02:03:12,717 --> 02:03:12,898
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

1382
02:03:12,918 --> 02:03:16,860
[SPEAKER_16]: So at this point in time, I will declare the public hearing open.

1417
02:05:02,880 --> 02:05:03,700
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1418
02:05:04,080 --> 02:05:05,941
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Council.

1419
02:05:05,961 --> 02:05:08,842
[SPEAKER_07]: Council President.

1420
02:05:08,962 --> 02:05:11,783
[SPEAKER_07]: In discussions, if we can, this evening we were given

1421
02:05:13,573 --> 02:05:18,575
[SPEAKER_07]: following public hearing conducted, the Community Development Board had some recommendations.

1422
02:05:19,096 --> 02:05:32,922
[SPEAKER_07]: If our Director DiLorenzo can approach the podium again, can she possibly go through each one and help us understand so we can move forward with this with better knowledge?

1423
02:05:34,499 --> 02:05:34,959
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1424
02:05:35,319 --> 02:05:40,602
[SPEAKER_21]: As you know, the Community Development Board had a hearing in the spring and had a second public hearing just last week.

1425
02:05:41,442 --> 02:05:48,986
[SPEAKER_21]: And so some of these items were, they've been actually discussed and presented to the council in an orally correspondence.

1426
02:05:49,546 --> 02:05:55,709
[SPEAKER_21]: And the other additional comments were elaborated upon and added to this recommendation.

1427
02:05:55,749 --> 02:05:57,950
[SPEAKER_21]: So the Community Development Board, I'm going to just read it.

1428
02:05:58,770 --> 02:06:02,712
[SPEAKER_21]: And the letter is from John DePriest, the chairperson of the

1429
02:06:03,260 --> 02:06:08,542
[SPEAKER_21]: Community Development Board and its relative to the proposed amendment to chapter 94, inclusionary housing.

1430
02:06:09,203 --> 02:06:20,528
[SPEAKER_21]: Following a public hearing conducted on February 13th, 2019, the Community Development Board voted to recommend that the Medford City Council adopt the proposed amendment with the following changes.

1431
02:06:21,108 --> 02:06:29,372
[SPEAKER_21]: Number one, in section 2.0, definitions covered project, insert this sentence after the last sentence of that section,

1432
02:06:29,973 --> 02:06:38,419
[SPEAKER_21]: doesn't say that, I added that, but a covered project shall include projects that are incrementally divided or phased within a five-year period.

1433
02:06:40,961 --> 02:06:47,965
[SPEAKER_21]: Number two, in section 2.0 definitions, segmented, remove the words 24-month and substitute five-year.

1434
02:06:49,086 --> 02:06:59,093
[SPEAKER_21]: Number three, in section 3.0 applicability in 1A and 1B, insert the words over a five-year period following the words dwelling units.

1435
02:07:00,146 --> 02:07:06,769
[SPEAKER_21]: Four, in section 6.0, mandatory provision affordable units, correct the following typographical error.

1436
02:07:07,149 --> 02:07:09,570
[SPEAKER_21]: Change A to C on the bottom line.

1437
02:07:10,811 --> 02:07:19,594
[SPEAKER_21]: Number five, in section 6.0, mandatory provisions of affordable units, add a subsection three, all covered projects that comply with the following.

1438
02:07:19,634 --> 02:07:22,596
[SPEAKER_21]: Now this gets a little wordy, so I'll just read that.

1439
02:07:22,816 --> 02:07:28,238
[SPEAKER_21]: Fractional units, where the required number of affordable units results in a fraction of a unit,

1440
02:07:28,884 --> 02:07:31,887
[SPEAKER_21]: The required number should be rounded up to the nearest whole number.

1441
02:07:33,168 --> 02:07:34,008
[SPEAKER_21]: B, phasing.

1442
02:07:34,229 --> 02:07:40,794
[SPEAKER_21]: Affordable units should not be the last units to be developed or occupied in any covered project.

1443
02:07:41,475 --> 02:07:45,679
[SPEAKER_21]: And C, non-avoidance by phasing or segmentation.

1444
02:07:46,339 --> 02:07:51,464
[SPEAKER_21]: A development shall not be phased or segmented in a manner to avoid compliance with the section.

1445
02:07:51,864 --> 02:07:55,287
[SPEAKER_21]: The Special Permit Granting Authority shall not approve any covered project

1446
02:07:55,611 --> 02:08:16,849
[SPEAKER_21]: that results in 10 or more dwelling units if the land or parcels of land were held in common ownership, including ownership by related or jointly controlled persons or entities, and were subdivided or otherwise modified within the previous five years to avoid compliance without complying with this section.

1447
02:08:17,349 --> 02:08:23,014
[SPEAKER_21]: This section shall also be enforceable against purchases of land previously held in common ownership with land

1448
02:08:23,525 --> 02:08:35,917
[SPEAKER_21]: that received, after the date of adoption of this section, approvals or permits for development, to the effect that units developed under such previous development shall be counted toward the calculation of number of units under this section."

1449
02:08:37,138 --> 02:08:46,868
[SPEAKER_21]: Finally, at the end of the letter, it says, additionally, the board recommended that, while reviewing the proposed ordinance, the city council consider recommendations that may be presented

1450
02:08:47,333 --> 02:08:49,034
[SPEAKER_21]: by the Housing and Method Coalition.

1451
02:08:49,074 --> 02:08:50,735
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you for your consideration of these comments.

1452
02:08:50,795 --> 02:08:52,035
[SPEAKER_21]: John DePriest, chairperson.

1453
02:08:52,295 --> 02:08:52,616
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1454
02:08:52,856 --> 02:08:56,097
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Scarapelli, did you have questions regarding this?

1455
02:08:56,197 --> 02:08:57,938
[SPEAKER_16]: Or I know Councilor Locarno did, but I want to make sure.

1456
02:08:57,958 --> 02:08:58,498
[SPEAKER_16]: You had the floor.

1457
02:08:59,039 --> 02:09:08,243
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I think that if I could, I know that the Housing and Method Coalition have done an unbelievable job.

1458
02:09:09,064 --> 02:09:13,766
[SPEAKER_07]: We've reviewed what their changes and what they would like to see happen.

1459
02:09:13,786 --> 02:09:16,127
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that what I'd like to do

1460
02:09:17,198 --> 02:09:23,543
[SPEAKER_07]: Council President, I would like to adopt and vote this section in.

1461
02:09:24,223 --> 02:09:38,652
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I would like to hold a subcommittee to meet with and review all of the additional information from the Housing Method Coalition program and looking to that as we move forward.

1462
02:09:39,313 --> 02:09:41,354
[SPEAKER_16]: So, Judge, I want to make sure I add this right.

1463
02:09:41,394 --> 02:09:43,796
[SPEAKER_16]: So you would like to basically make a motion to

1464
02:09:44,417 --> 02:09:54,179
[SPEAKER_16]: approve this, uh, the ordinance with regard to include the changes that were put forth by the, uh, by the, um, correct.

1465
02:09:55,539 --> 02:10:01,121
[SPEAKER_16]: And that have in a meeting, uh, at a later date, subcommittee or committee.

1466
02:10:01,181 --> 02:10:02,101
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to committee of the whole.

1467
02:10:02,141 --> 02:10:03,001
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this is important.

1468
02:10:03,201 --> 02:10:09,182
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, if the council doesn't want to do that, we can go with the zoning subcommittee.

1469
02:10:09,222 --> 02:10:11,423
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gladly chair, chair that program.

1470
02:10:11,543 --> 02:10:11,663
[SPEAKER_07]: So,

1471
02:10:12,587 --> 02:10:20,513
[SPEAKER_16]: and later have a committee of the whole meeting to meet with the, or talk about the recommendations of the Housing and Mental Coalition.

1472
02:10:20,813 --> 02:10:21,013
[SPEAKER_16]: Correct.

1473
02:10:21,033 --> 02:10:21,113
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1474
02:10:22,474 --> 02:10:24,656
[SPEAKER_16]: On that motion, Councilor Longo-Kern.

1475
02:10:26,977 --> 02:10:27,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1476
02:10:28,999 --> 02:10:31,220
[SPEAKER_16]: Seconded by Councilor Del Rosso, Councilor Longo-Kern.

1477
02:10:33,082 --> 02:10:41,328
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to also amend, I think it's important, I think our Office of Community Development Director,

1478
02:10:42,038 --> 02:11:02,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Lauren G. Lorenzo said it right, that we are adding, as a community, adding a lot of housing units to Medford, and that's been going on the last several years, leading to, number one, the council asking for some help, money for a consultant to review our zoning ordinances.

1479
02:11:02,592 --> 02:11:03,753
[SPEAKER_03]: That's number one.

1480
02:11:03,813 --> 02:11:10,337
[SPEAKER_03]: But also to, there's been an issue with affordable housing in Medford.

1481
02:11:12,835 --> 02:11:15,377
[SPEAKER_03]: developers are sticking to that 10%.

1482
02:11:15,718 --> 02:11:29,150
[SPEAKER_03]: So for me, I just want to make it clear that I believe this alone is a good tool to solve a problem that we have in Medford, which is affordable housing.

1483
02:11:29,791 --> 02:11:35,176
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we have enough units and apartments, and we have 350 more going up on Locust Street.

1484
02:11:35,216 --> 02:11:38,759
[SPEAKER_03]: But what we have, and the mayor has signed on to,

1485
02:11:39,775 --> 02:11:47,759
[SPEAKER_03]: Governor Baker's initiative to create more housing, which, you know, is a plus for Boston, but I don't believe it's necessarily what Medford needs.

1486
02:11:48,439 --> 02:11:50,700
[SPEAKER_03]: Medford doesn't have a housing crisis.

1487
02:11:50,800 --> 02:11:52,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Medford has an affordable housing issue.

1488
02:11:53,322 --> 02:11:55,303
[SPEAKER_03]: And this, I believe, addresses that.

1489
02:11:55,923 --> 02:12:04,087
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to make clear, when I reviewed it, and we spent a number of meetings reviewing it, Councilor Knight, Councilor Falco and I,

1490
02:12:05,162 --> 02:12:17,108
[SPEAKER_03]: There was no intention, especially, I can speak for myself, no intention for this to be a tool to allow more development in areas, say, single family districts.

1491
02:12:17,348 --> 02:12:20,110
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not the intent of why we did this.

1492
02:12:20,210 --> 02:12:34,157
[SPEAKER_03]: And there is language in here that specifically states that, the last sentence, the provisions of this ordinance shall be considered supplemental of existing zoning ordinances to the extent

1493
02:12:34,552 --> 02:12:40,153
[SPEAKER_03]: that a conflict exists between this ordinance and others, the more restrictive ordinance or provisions therein shall apply.

1494
02:12:40,853 --> 02:12:42,334
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to just make that very clear.

1495
02:12:42,354 --> 02:12:52,496
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we need to just add, and I make the amendment to add a few words under section one, purpose and intent.

1496
02:12:52,556 --> 02:12:53,997
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll read it for my colleagues.

1497
02:12:54,857 --> 02:13:00,878
[SPEAKER_03]: The purpose of this ordinance is to encourage development of new housing that is affordable to low and moderate income households.

1498
02:13:01,638 --> 02:13:04,199
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd like to add in applicable zoning districts

1499
02:13:04,575 --> 02:13:06,276
[SPEAKER_03]: that require site plan review.

1500
02:13:06,296 --> 02:13:16,063
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's in the last sentence of the ordinance, but I also want to make it clear in the purpose and intent of what we're doing here as a council.

1501
02:13:16,403 --> 02:13:29,892
[SPEAKER_03]: We want, if a developer comes in, wants to put up apartments in apartment one, apartment two, or wants to apply for a variance, and is given a variance, that we want, obviously, more affordable housing.

1502
02:13:30,518 --> 02:13:34,161
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to keep the character of our neighborhoods as best we can.

1503
02:13:34,201 --> 02:13:37,283
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just want to make it very clear that that is not my intent.

1504
02:13:38,924 --> 02:13:40,065
[SPEAKER_03]: Neighborhoods are number one.

1505
02:13:40,125 --> 02:13:45,590
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you've seen this council fight for neighborhood issues and rights when it's surrounding development.

1506
02:13:45,630 --> 02:13:48,992
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to be very clear where I stand on this.

1507
02:13:49,312 --> 02:13:53,836
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to hear from the citizen committee that has also reviewed this.

1508
02:13:53,936 --> 02:13:58,760
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know the recommendation is to take up some of those issues in committee.

1509
02:14:00,334 --> 02:14:06,299
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been in discussions with the group and I agree with some of the changes, so let's see how it pans out.

1510
02:14:06,559 --> 02:14:06,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1511
02:14:09,582 --> 02:14:11,003
[SPEAKER_21]: May I speak on council?

1512
02:14:11,103 --> 02:14:11,864
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, please.

1513
02:14:11,884 --> 02:14:22,532
[SPEAKER_21]: So this is certainly not to, you know, it's within the prerogative of the council to adopt any change they want, but I just want to clarify a bit of the concern that you raised.

1514
02:14:26,186 --> 02:14:31,670
[SPEAKER_21]: The affordable housing can be proposed in any district, just like site plan review could be any district.

1515
02:14:32,010 --> 02:14:42,578
[SPEAKER_21]: We don't really have the control of preventing a property owner from petitioning for something, whether it complies with zoning or not.

1516
02:14:42,938 --> 02:14:47,241
[SPEAKER_21]: Certainly, the action of its approval can be denied if it went through that process.

1517
02:14:48,562 --> 02:14:54,046
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know if I'm making this a little bit more confusing, but I don't know that you have to make that discernment.

1518
02:14:55,642 --> 02:15:12,274
[SPEAKER_21]: Site plan review projects, projects 10 or more, it's not allowing the use, it's not defining the use, it's just saying if something like that is proposed and it requires a special permit or variance to do that, then it must provide these units.

1519
02:15:12,314 --> 02:15:17,078
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's not allowing or permitting the particular use that's in the zoning ordinance.

1520
02:15:25,583 --> 02:15:26,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have any further questions?

1521
02:15:26,503 --> 02:15:30,104
[SPEAKER_03]: Just that one amendment right now, and I'd like to hear from people.

1522
02:15:30,424 --> 02:15:34,005
[SPEAKER_16]: We have a couple of councilors that have questions, so we're going to Councilor Knight.

1523
02:15:34,585 --> 02:15:36,145
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1524
02:15:36,445 --> 02:15:41,006
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm very pleased to see this matter reach the council floor this evening for a public hearing.

1525
02:15:41,446 --> 02:15:54,449
[SPEAKER_18]: This is a product of work that the Zoning and Ordinance Subcommittee worked on for a period of time for about two and a half years, at which time we split the Zoning and Ordinance Subcommittee to a Zoning Subcommittee to an Ordinance Subcommittee, and through a team of

1526
02:15:55,387 --> 02:15:59,310
[SPEAKER_18]: You, Councilor Longo, and myself were able to come up with the language that's included here.

1527
02:15:59,930 --> 02:16:05,974
[SPEAKER_18]: I think Director DiLorenzo gave a great breakdown as to how we came to this point.

1528
02:16:06,334 --> 02:16:10,837
[SPEAKER_18]: This ordinance establishes criteria as to when inclusionary zoning is applicable.

1529
02:16:11,747 --> 02:16:24,054
[SPEAKER_18]: It establishes a three-tiered system for when a developer comes into the community looking to build a development of ten units or more, that certain thresholds need to be met for affordability.

1530
02:16:24,675 --> 02:16:27,116
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's really a great step in the right direction.

1531
02:16:27,356 --> 02:16:30,738
[SPEAKER_18]: We are formalizing a process that was done previously by negotiation.

1532
02:16:31,447 --> 02:16:37,733
[SPEAKER_18]: And the language that we used was based upon best practices that were put out through the Massachusetts Smart Growth Alliance.

1533
02:16:38,975 --> 02:16:45,541
[SPEAKER_18]: It's been determined to be a best practice across a number of municipalities here in Massachusetts municipal government, so I'm very pleased about that.

1534
02:16:46,142 --> 02:16:48,324
[SPEAKER_18]: The paper's also going to go on legal review, Mr. President.

1535
02:16:48,344 --> 02:16:51,327
[SPEAKER_18]: It's been reviewed by a city solicitor previously prior to introduction.

1536
02:16:52,087 --> 02:17:03,173
[SPEAKER_18]: The councils vote on it a number of times, probably five times, if I can remember correctly, between subcommittee, committee of the whole reports, subcommittee reports, sending it to the CD board and the like.

1537
02:17:03,794 --> 02:17:16,841
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm really excited about this, and I think that Councilor Scott Pelly's directive was the right one, that we adopt the recommendations that have been made by the CD board to include them into this ordinance, and that we move forward for a first reading on that.

1538
02:17:17,214 --> 02:17:20,616
[SPEAKER_18]: And then we can take up the other issues in the committee of the whole meeting or a subcommittee meeting.

1539
02:17:20,716 --> 02:17:22,937
[SPEAKER_18]: Personally, I feel as though a subcommittee would be more beneficial.

1540
02:17:23,597 --> 02:17:26,479
[SPEAKER_18]: However, I defer to him as the chairman as to what direction he'd like to go.

1541
02:17:27,099 --> 02:17:34,563
[SPEAKER_18]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I support Councilor Scott Pelly's direction that this should go in wholeheartedly.

1542
02:17:34,583 --> 02:17:39,426
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that we should move for a first reading this evening after adopting the requirements that were made by the CD board.

1543
02:17:39,919 --> 02:17:50,625
[SPEAKER_18]: I certainly have no problem adopting the amendments that Councilor Longo has offered this evening because I feel as though the way that she's articulated and expressed it is a direct reflection of the discussions that we had in there.

1544
02:17:50,665 --> 02:17:55,327
[SPEAKER_18]: We were deliberating and vetting this material over that period of, you know, two and a half years.

1545
02:17:55,868 --> 02:17:59,449
[SPEAKER_18]: So with that being said, I would second Councilor Scott Pelley's motion and move forward with the matter.

1546
02:18:00,150 --> 02:18:01,030
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1547
02:18:01,671 --> 02:18:02,631
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor DelaRusso.

1548
02:18:03,732 --> 02:18:05,473
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, I've said what I had to.

1549
02:18:07,883 --> 02:18:08,544
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Marks.

1550
02:18:09,544 --> 02:18:10,425
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1551
02:18:10,846 --> 02:18:24,757
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just wondering maybe if the Director of Community Development could share with us potentially some of the reasoning behind some of the figures that were arrived at within the Community Development Board's recommendations.

1552
02:18:27,179 --> 02:18:32,524
[SPEAKER_11]: For instance, the number of units that they arrived at was 10 units.

1553
02:18:34,643 --> 02:18:39,226
[SPEAKER_21]: in the site plan review ordinance, but actually these numbers were actually proposed by the zoning subcommittee.

1554
02:18:39,726 --> 02:18:42,888
[SPEAKER_21]: So the community development board agreed with those.

1555
02:18:43,208 --> 02:18:44,028
[SPEAKER_11]: They agreed with the number.

1556
02:18:44,048 --> 02:18:44,269
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

1557
02:18:44,589 --> 02:18:54,815
[SPEAKER_11]: So maybe my question is to my colleagues then, because it's been mentioned to us that most of the surrounding communities start off at six units rather than 10 units.

1558
02:18:56,636 --> 02:19:01,899
[SPEAKER_11]: Why did we start off at a much higher number of units where affordability is

1559
02:19:03,352 --> 02:19:15,781
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want to put anyone on the spot, but if the surrounding communities are all doing it, you know, why would we start, you know, at probably 40% higher than what they're doing?

1560
02:19:15,861 --> 02:19:24,527
[SPEAKER_18]: For consistency purposes, counselor, ultimately we want our court of ordinances to read consistently from point A to point B to point C to point D. And when you look at our

1561
02:19:25,433 --> 02:19:29,577
[SPEAKER_18]: court of ordinances, the projects that require site plan review, our projects of 10 units or higher.

1562
02:19:29,697 --> 02:19:36,202
[SPEAKER_18]: So we decided that it would be in the best interest for continuity purposes to keep that same criteria and same threshold as 10 units.

1563
02:19:37,383 --> 02:19:38,184
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1564
02:19:38,364 --> 02:19:46,591
[SPEAKER_11]: So my recommendation would be, and we could do with this at any point, but I agree with the lessening of the units.

1565
02:19:47,412 --> 02:19:49,013
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel very strongly that

1566
02:19:49,717 --> 02:20:00,110
[SPEAKER_11]: especially where Winchester, Arlington, Everett, Somerville all start off at six units, that we should be also starting off at six units regarding the affordability component.

1567
02:20:02,153 --> 02:20:06,358
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, Mr. President, it's mentioned, you know, the term affordability.

1568
02:20:07,063 --> 02:20:10,246
[SPEAKER_11]: And when you talk to different people, I actually work for the Department of Housing.

1569
02:20:10,867 --> 02:20:24,178
[SPEAKER_11]: And when you talk to different residents and you start talking about the median income and what exactly does affordable housing mean, it's not very affordable, affordable housing.

1570
02:20:24,899 --> 02:20:33,947
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think anything we can do as a city to open that up to residents and truly make it affordable, I think that's what we should be exploring.

1571
02:20:34,418 --> 02:20:44,623
[SPEAKER_11]: especially in an economy, Mr. President, that, you know, we're looking at outrageous amounts for a one-bedroom, a two-bedroom.

1572
02:20:45,223 --> 02:20:48,865
[SPEAKER_11]: You can almost guarantee any new construction for a one-bedroom in this city.

1573
02:20:49,245 --> 02:20:54,208
[SPEAKER_11]: You're close to $2,000, maybe even $2,200, $2,400 for a one-bedroom.

1574
02:20:55,248 --> 02:21:00,491
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, and then it goes up as the number of beds, naturally, rooms increase.

1575
02:21:01,191 --> 02:21:03,492
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think those are the tweaks that we need to look at.

1576
02:21:03,896 --> 02:21:07,617
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm not opposed to doing it at a later time.

1577
02:21:08,437 --> 02:21:14,438
[SPEAKER_11]: I just would hate to have to reinvent the wheel and go through the whole process again where we can make some tweaks now.

1578
02:21:15,518 --> 02:21:18,879
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm not opposed to making some tweaks now to this.

1579
02:21:19,339 --> 02:21:31,761
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, this may not be the appropriate forum here, but I'm not opposed to making some worthy tweaks that really address some of the affordability issues in our community.

1580
02:21:32,522 --> 02:21:37,784
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I hear all too often people can no longer live in our community, and that troubles me.

1581
02:21:38,565 --> 02:21:52,771
[SPEAKER_11]: It really does, not just for younger people, like my own kids that would like to live in the city someday but probably can't afford it, but people that are actually living here, seniors and families and working people that can no longer live in a community that they grew up in.

1582
02:21:52,791 --> 02:21:55,472
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think these are the issues that we have to address.

1583
02:21:55,925 --> 02:22:00,929
[SPEAKER_11]: And maybe it's small in stature by changing the numbers and so forth.

1584
02:22:01,870 --> 02:22:03,471
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think every little bit helps.

1585
02:22:04,512 --> 02:22:10,898
[SPEAKER_11]: And so that's what I'm going to be pushing for, whether it's tonight or this meeting that Councilor Scott Pelly called for.

1586
02:22:11,358 --> 02:22:12,379
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1587
02:22:14,301 --> 02:22:15,322
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Scott Pelly.

1588
02:22:15,522 --> 02:22:15,842
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1589
02:22:16,403 --> 02:22:21,187
[SPEAKER_07]: To follow up with Councilor Marks, I think that having our

1590
02:22:23,693 --> 02:22:28,095
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, our organization come on up that has worked so diligently.

1591
02:22:28,155 --> 02:22:43,081
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that the group has had some great initiatives, but I think to wait and table this issue and this chapter right now, I think it'll be prohibitive for us.

1592
02:22:43,141 --> 02:22:47,703
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that moving this forward and then set up a subcommittee meeting

1593
02:22:48,276 --> 02:22:56,683
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, I welcome our organization to come up and talk in a minute and share some of those initiatives that they're looking for.

1594
02:22:57,423 --> 02:22:59,505
[SPEAKER_07]: One of those issues is moving from 10 to 6.

1595
02:23:00,246 --> 02:23:05,169
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it's something that moving to the subcommittee meeting as soon as possible.

1596
02:23:05,610 --> 02:23:14,957
[SPEAKER_07]: But what I want to try to do right now is get the information we have and move forward to what we have right now so things don't pass us by because that's happening very quickly.

1597
02:23:15,057 --> 02:23:15,998
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you.

1598
02:23:16,733 --> 02:23:18,214
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1599
02:23:18,974 --> 02:23:19,494
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Knight.

1600
02:23:20,154 --> 02:23:21,275
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1601
02:23:21,295 --> 02:23:29,858
[SPEAKER_18]: I also think it's important to point out that the date that this paper would become effective would be the date that it's approved by the council and signed by the mayor, right?

1602
02:23:29,978 --> 02:23:34,200
[SPEAKER_18]: So any applications that come in between then and now would not be covered under the Zoning Act.

1603
02:23:34,220 --> 02:23:45,985
[SPEAKER_18]: It doesn't become effective until it's signed by the mayor, which is very important because I know that we have a number of large developments that are going to be coming into the community that have not submitted applications for permitting at this point in time, but there will be very, very soon.

1604
02:23:46,536 --> 02:23:56,382
[SPEAKER_18]: And with the introduction of this bill, I'm sure that's going to be also speeding them up a little bit to get an application into our building department prior to the approval of this.

1605
02:23:56,442 --> 02:24:05,287
[SPEAKER_18]: So I really do think it's important that we act on the languages before so we can get something on the books so that we can hold these developers and the community accountable to this threshold.

1606
02:24:05,607 --> 02:24:09,550
[SPEAKER_18]: We can go back to the drawing board if we need to, to modify it, twerk it and tweak it, that's fine.

1607
02:24:09,910 --> 02:24:14,653
[SPEAKER_18]: But for the purposes of getting something on the books, I think it's very important that we do so because it will not take effect

1608
02:24:15,532 --> 02:24:20,334
[SPEAKER_18]: until it's signed by the mayor and all applications thereafter will be covered by it, but not previously.

1609
02:24:20,814 --> 02:24:21,715
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1610
02:24:25,316 --> 02:24:26,056
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Marks.

1611
02:24:27,517 --> 02:24:43,924
[SPEAKER_11]: Just if I could, knowing the process and the number of readings it has to go through, would it be feasible to have a subcommittee meeting while this is going through the legislative process and amending it now, rather than going through a whole other process to tweak something that

1612
02:24:44,455 --> 02:24:50,363
[SPEAKER_11]: we may all be in agreement with right now, because it has to go to a second reading where it gets published, a third reading.

1613
02:24:52,066 --> 02:24:56,953
[SPEAKER_11]: It may be worthwhile for us to do it while this process takes place, Mr. President.

1614
02:24:58,074 --> 02:24:58,996
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilman Marks.

1615
02:25:02,337 --> 02:25:03,158
[SPEAKER_04]: City Solicitor Rumley.

1616
02:25:03,478 --> 02:25:03,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1617
02:25:04,178 --> 02:25:05,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening, Mr. President.

1618
02:25:05,259 --> 02:25:08,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Mark Rumley, City Solicitor, 50 Woodrow Avenue in Medford.

1619
02:25:08,682 --> 02:25:14,066
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the things, and I'm probably preaching to the choir here, but we have just opened a public hearing.

1620
02:25:14,747 --> 02:25:27,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, subcommittee meetings and all that can happen at any time whenever they're scheduled to think about, discern, and to understand better the nuances of particular issues like affordable housing.

1621
02:25:27,637 --> 02:25:29,999
[SPEAKER_04]: But a public hearing once opened,

1622
02:25:30,493 --> 02:25:35,875
[SPEAKER_04]: either gets continued to another council session, as you know, a continued public hearing.

1623
02:25:36,436 --> 02:25:39,157
[SPEAKER_04]: So that we have really two separate ships.

1624
02:25:39,817 --> 02:25:58,745
[SPEAKER_04]: If the idea was to adopt at this public hearing, the inclusionary housing ordinance in its present fashion, even as amended by the planning board, and then to take additional ideas, requests, data, for example, your idea to go down to six units.

1625
02:25:59,124 --> 02:26:06,208
[SPEAKER_04]: If you wanted to handle that separately at a subcommittee meeting, you could do it, but you can't join the two because one's at a hearing and the other would be at a meeting.

1626
02:26:11,330 --> 02:26:13,031
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, actually I was thinking about that.

1627
02:26:13,071 --> 02:26:18,194
[SPEAKER_04]: The way your witnesses go for zoning under the statute, this has already gone through its three levels.

1628
02:26:18,274 --> 02:26:25,478
[SPEAKER_04]: It's come from the launch pad, which is the council to the planning board, which is its first place of discussion and public hearing.

1629
02:26:25,911 --> 02:26:28,553
[SPEAKER_04]: back to the council with recommendations, which is tonight.

1630
02:26:28,993 --> 02:26:34,358
[SPEAKER_04]: If the council passes it, and I'm just saying that tonight, then it would go to the mayor for signature.

1631
02:26:35,879 --> 02:26:36,059
[SPEAKER_11]: Correct.

1632
02:26:36,700 --> 02:26:38,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Because there's a little nuance or a twist there from.

1633
02:26:38,841 --> 02:26:41,543
[SPEAKER_11]: So it doesn't require a posting then?

1634
02:26:41,643 --> 02:26:41,944
[SPEAKER_04]: A what?

1635
02:26:41,964 --> 02:26:42,484
[SPEAKER_11]: A posting.

1636
02:26:43,545 --> 02:26:47,928
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's already been, there's already been a public advertisement on it before it went to the planning board.

1637
02:26:48,389 --> 02:26:51,591
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's also, this hearing has been advertised by the city clerk.

1638
02:26:53,253 --> 02:26:54,634
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so you're saying this is the 13th?

1639
02:26:55,602 --> 02:27:04,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, actually that's not a bad analogy, but technically the statute 48-5 doesn't say three readings the way it would with ordinance adoptions.

1640
02:27:05,625 --> 02:27:11,326
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just wanted to point out, which you already knew, I know you know well, the difference between a hearing and a meeting.

1641
02:27:11,766 --> 02:27:20,629
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is the opening of a hearing, so it either gets continued to another night to keep the hearing open, or it doesn't, one of the two.

1642
02:27:23,351 --> 02:27:24,492
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Marks.

1643
02:27:25,273 --> 02:27:48,390
[SPEAKER_11]: So our option tonight, I was under a different impression, but our option tonight is either to tweak and make changes, which is our prerogative to this, or approve it as Councilor Knight mentioned, and then at a later date, move towards some amendments to this, which, you know, hopefully will be quick, but who knows?

1644
02:27:49,951 --> 02:27:51,052
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, who knows?

1645
02:27:51,711 --> 02:27:54,773
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why I was hoping we can try to put some of this stuff through tonight.

1646
02:27:55,514 --> 02:27:57,635
[SPEAKER_11]: So that'll be the druthers of the council if they.

1647
02:27:59,136 --> 02:28:00,257
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

1648
02:28:00,477 --> 02:28:01,518
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1649
02:28:04,720 --> 02:28:05,581
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Knight, did you?

1650
02:28:06,001 --> 02:28:07,582
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, I'd like to move the question as amended.

1651
02:28:08,083 --> 02:28:10,264
OK.

1652
02:28:10,484 --> 02:28:16,709
[SPEAKER_16]: So there was actually, I believe, Councilor, Vice President Longo Kern and Councilor Scott Cawley, did you want to hear from anyone else?

1653
02:28:16,809 --> 02:28:17,429
[SPEAKER_16]: Or you could?

1654
02:28:24,347 --> 02:28:25,028
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you very much.

1655
02:28:25,048 --> 02:28:26,949
[SPEAKER_24]: Again, Roberta Cameron, 12 North Street.

1656
02:28:27,489 --> 02:28:34,114
[SPEAKER_24]: I wanted to at least give a couple of moments to explain why we're here today.

1657
02:28:34,975 --> 02:28:38,998
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm working with the Housing in Medford coalition that was mentioned earlier.

1658
02:28:39,418 --> 02:28:41,499
[SPEAKER_24]: We are a Medford resident initiative.

1659
02:28:41,539 --> 02:28:46,303
[SPEAKER_24]: We've been meeting since last fall to look at ways to address the affordable housing needs in the community.

1660
02:28:46,760 --> 02:28:51,024
[SPEAKER_24]: So I just wanted to make that clear, who we are and why we're doing this.

1661
02:28:51,604 --> 02:28:58,710
[SPEAKER_24]: And the reason why inclusionary zoning in particular is so important, it's only one of many tools that we need to look at as a city.

1662
02:28:59,170 --> 02:29:07,257
[SPEAKER_24]: But inclusionary zoning ensures that where there's new development, it's going to have some income diversity in the new development.

1663
02:29:08,755 --> 02:29:11,896
[SPEAKER_24]: it's only luxury housing that's being developed.

1664
02:29:12,376 --> 02:29:28,660
[SPEAKER_24]: And inclusionary zoning is ensuring that at least some of the units and every new development that's subject to it are going to enable people who work in the community or people who traditionally lived in the community to continue living here.

1665
02:29:29,440 --> 02:29:37,242
[SPEAKER_24]: And another reason why inclusionary zoning is so important is because the state has a requirement that every community in the Commonwealth

1666
02:29:37,790 --> 02:29:42,495
[SPEAKER_24]: has a responsibility to provide 10% of their housing as being affordable.

1667
02:29:43,056 --> 02:29:49,884
[SPEAKER_24]: As long as we're not holding our developers up to that standard minimally, we're subsidizing them.

1668
02:29:50,084 --> 02:29:58,554
[SPEAKER_24]: We're taking on the responsibility of providing that affordable housing without requiring of the developers that they contribute to that affordable housing.

1669
02:29:59,093 --> 02:30:12,715
[SPEAKER_24]: So this is really holding, just having inclusionary zoning is holding the city at no harm from additional development in terms of affordable housing.

1670
02:30:13,176 --> 02:30:22,057
[SPEAKER_24]: So that's basically what I wanted to communicate to you this evening, why we're looking at wanting the city to pass inclusionary zoning.

1671
02:30:22,537 --> 02:30:22,877
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1672
02:30:23,217 --> 02:30:23,537
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1673
02:30:25,978 --> 02:30:27,178
[SPEAKER_16]: Name and address for the record, please.

1674
02:30:28,263 --> 02:30:30,024
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark Curtis, 89 Traincroft Street.

1675
02:30:31,225 --> 02:30:38,069
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here with Roberta and Alex and Susan Collins and Barry Ingber and a number of other members of the coalition.

1676
02:30:39,710 --> 02:30:47,794
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the pleasure of serving on a technical subcommittee of the coalition along with Roberta and Alex and a number of others.

1677
02:30:48,815 --> 02:30:52,837
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been meeting since December to review the proposed ordinance.

1678
02:30:54,673 --> 02:30:58,960
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at the most recent data on rents and development costs.

1679
02:31:00,563 --> 02:31:04,649
[SPEAKER_00]: We did an exhaustive comparison of inclusionary zoning ordinances in other communities.

1680
02:31:04,669 --> 02:31:08,496
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also created a financial real estate model.

1681
02:31:09,124 --> 02:31:18,510
[SPEAKER_00]: in order to examine the effects of different affordability requirements on both developer returns and also project feasibility based on a whole range of factors.

1682
02:31:19,211 --> 02:31:35,001
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really kicked the tires and looked at what was proposed and looked at what we thought was feasible with the goal of trying to maximize the benefits that Medford gets from these developments.

1683
02:31:35,741 --> 02:31:36,702
[SPEAKER_00]: That was our simple goal.

1684
02:31:38,902 --> 02:31:48,570
[SPEAKER_00]: Based on our analysis, we feel like the ordinance as it's drafted is quite strong and is going to accomplish really good things.

1685
02:31:49,211 --> 02:31:54,755
[SPEAKER_00]: We do think that there are some relatively minor tweaks that could be made that would make it even stronger.

1686
02:31:55,896 --> 02:31:59,019
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think that you should consider those either now or in the future.

1687
02:32:00,480 --> 02:32:04,503
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to very quickly mention them in case there are any questions.

1688
02:32:05,044 --> 02:32:06,485
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd be happy to answer your questions.

1689
02:32:08,282 --> 02:32:17,725
[SPEAKER_00]: The first and probably most important suggestion is adding that small 5% band of affordability at 60% of median income.

1690
02:32:18,265 --> 02:32:33,330
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that does is it broadens the affordability of the project and allows more Metro residents to qualify for those affordable units without increasing the total number of affordable units.

1691
02:32:33,884 --> 02:32:43,171
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did a feasibility analysis and found that it had a very small 0.25% impact on developer returns.

1692
02:32:43,811 --> 02:32:46,694
[SPEAKER_00]: So didn't flip from feasible to infeasible.

1693
02:32:47,374 --> 02:32:52,198
[SPEAKER_00]: This is affordable to the developers and it's affordable to Medford residents.

1694
02:32:52,338 --> 02:32:53,399
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think that makes sense.

1695
02:32:54,920 --> 02:32:59,143
[SPEAKER_00]: We also wanted to tweak the project size categories.

1696
02:33:00,310 --> 02:33:05,812
[SPEAKER_00]: in order to affect that additional affordability band.

1697
02:33:06,832 --> 02:33:13,715
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are starting at 20 units or higher having 15% affordability.

1698
02:33:15,315 --> 02:33:22,117
[SPEAKER_00]: Third, we wanted to go down from 10 units to six units because our model shows that that is financially feasible.

1699
02:33:22,558 --> 02:33:26,659
[SPEAKER_00]: And also we know that it's been road tested in other communities and that it works.

1700
02:33:28,268 --> 02:33:36,392
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, we wanted to suggest adding that 10% of the units in larger projects be three bedroom units.

1701
02:33:37,353 --> 02:33:45,317
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, because we're trying to increase the diversity of housing that's available in Medford and having housing for families as well as individuals is important.

1702
02:33:45,357 --> 02:33:50,279
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that a lot of these developments are getting built with a lot of one bedrooms and two bedrooms.

1703
02:33:52,600 --> 02:33:55,722
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just gonna conclude by saying

1704
02:33:56,990 --> 02:33:59,470
[SPEAKER_00]: We need an inclusionary zoning ordinance.

1705
02:34:00,571 --> 02:34:01,471
[SPEAKER_00]: We need it now.

1706
02:34:03,291 --> 02:34:07,392
[SPEAKER_00]: It's essential that this gets approved with all reasonable haste.

1707
02:34:08,652 --> 02:34:13,033
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, we're vulnerable to additional development, as Adam says.

1708
02:34:14,293 --> 02:34:19,054
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not getting the community benefit that we should be getting from these projects.

1709
02:34:19,654 --> 02:34:21,874
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get this done.

1710
02:34:21,974 --> 02:34:22,314
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1711
02:34:22,494 --> 02:34:22,834
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1712
02:34:23,715 --> 02:34:24,455
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Scarpell.

1713
02:34:25,615 --> 02:34:26,255
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you again, Mark.

1714
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:39,449
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, the Housing in Memphis Coalition is a great venue when you look at what's brought together and why it's done.

1715
02:34:39,469 --> 02:34:50,797
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's so important that as a council we look at different concerns and different issues that we're not professional in to make such difficult decisions.

1716
02:34:50,857 --> 02:34:51,418
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's why

1717
02:34:51,882 --> 02:35:01,806
[SPEAKER_07]: For example, I'll use that we've asked the mayor for some help with financing, bringing in someone to look at our zoning and our ordinances so we can review those processes.

1718
02:35:02,326 --> 02:35:08,808
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that what we're seeing right now is a great indication of the great professionals we have in our own community.

1719
02:35:09,232 --> 02:35:22,452
[SPEAKER_07]: that spend their own time looking into very serious lapses that we have in our city and try to make them as beneficial to our growth in our future here in Medford.

1720
02:35:22,992 --> 02:35:24,652
[SPEAKER_07]: I applaud everything that you've done.

1721
02:35:24,712 --> 02:35:28,193
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that this is a great step forward.

1722
02:35:28,353 --> 02:35:34,334
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, I think that it's important that we get what we have in front of us as our third reading and move forward with that.

1723
02:35:34,875 --> 02:35:47,357
[SPEAKER_07]: Call for a subcommittee with the stakeholders, you included, that we can look at some of the – and all of these additions that we can add as amendments as we move forward.

1724
02:35:47,397 --> 02:35:49,738
[SPEAKER_07]: So again, I applaud your effort.

1725
02:35:51,990 --> 02:36:02,236
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish we knew, for my colleagues who put so much time and effort into this, that when you were meeting in the fall, it could have been great to have that piece together.

1726
02:36:02,276 --> 02:36:09,141
[SPEAKER_07]: So again, that's where maybe a little common dialogue would really have gone a long way here.

1727
02:36:10,817 --> 02:36:24,647
[SPEAKER_07]: the mayor's office meeting with the city council's subcommittee on zoning and all the hard work they were doing in another room, you're doing the same job and with more, I think, with more backbone in the sense with the knowledge of what's happening.

1728
02:36:25,207 --> 02:36:39,157
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that I'm going to stand moving forward with this option that I put forward and then I look forward to in the relatively near future to move to a subcommittee

1729
02:36:39,564 --> 02:36:41,024
[SPEAKER_07]: with all the stakeholders involved.

1730
02:36:41,044 --> 02:36:41,545
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you.

1731
02:36:41,865 --> 02:36:42,545
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Council.

1732
02:36:42,565 --> 02:36:43,725
[SPEAKER_16]: Scott Pelley, Vice President.

1733
02:36:43,845 --> 02:36:44,465
[SPEAKER_16]: Lungo Kern.

1734
02:36:44,965 --> 02:36:46,346
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, President Falco.

1735
02:36:46,626 --> 02:36:56,669
[SPEAKER_03]: I, too, I want to thank the Housing in Medford Coalition for a group of people to work tirelessly, obviously, to the same goal as the council.

1736
02:36:57,249 --> 02:36:59,810
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty admirable, and I appreciate that.

1737
02:37:00,650 --> 02:37:08,372
[SPEAKER_03]: I, too, wish that when we were discussing it in subcommittee that we knew about the Housing in Medford Coalition and we could have worked together, because I

1738
02:37:09,267 --> 02:37:10,827
[SPEAKER_03]: I like these proposals.

1739
02:37:10,907 --> 02:37:20,329
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the 60% changing the 80% and adding the 60% for five out of our 15%.

1740
02:37:21,029 --> 02:37:24,370
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no problem with looking at six units.

1741
02:37:24,410 --> 02:37:31,571
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like there are a number of communities that do do it, and there are a number of communities that, a couple that do have the 10, Cambridge and Chelsea.

1742
02:37:32,371 --> 02:37:33,411
[SPEAKER_03]: But I like the 12.5% versus the 10%.

1743
02:37:38,180 --> 02:37:46,686
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of these things I would be willing to vote on now, but at the same time, I want to respect my colleagues, people we've worked on it for quite some time, and I do want to move something forward.

1744
02:37:46,746 --> 02:37:57,634
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm looking to move this forward tonight as amended with regards to what the Community Development Board proposed, as well as my amendment to the intent and purpose section.

1745
02:37:59,075 --> 02:38:06,380
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we've worked very hard on it, and it's something that is definitely needed quickly before any

1746
02:38:08,001 --> 02:38:27,224
[SPEAKER_03]: I would just add that when we do have a committee meeting or committee of the whole meeting, that we do it in the zoning subcommittee, possibly, and group it in with the council forming a community advisory board with regards to development and zoning.

1747
02:38:27,304 --> 02:38:29,325
[SPEAKER_03]: We've asked for that a number of times.

1748
02:38:29,345 --> 02:38:31,805
[SPEAKER_03]: The administration will not put that board together.

1749
02:38:32,165 --> 02:38:33,546
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think the council needs to do that.

1750
02:38:33,566 --> 02:38:34,766
[SPEAKER_03]: We've discussed it in the past.

1751
02:38:34,786 --> 02:38:36,006
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to see it in the future.

1752
02:38:36,578 --> 02:38:40,101
[SPEAKER_03]: do that and review these changes at the same time, hopefully sometime in March.

1753
02:38:40,961 --> 02:38:41,262
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1754
02:38:41,662 --> 02:38:43,143
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Vice President Lungo-Kern.

1755
02:38:43,724 --> 02:38:51,970
[SPEAKER_16]: And if I just may add really quickly, thank you to the Housing in Bedford Coalition for all your thoughts and ideas.

1756
02:38:53,391 --> 02:38:59,356
[SPEAKER_16]: When I was on the Zoning Subcommittee when we began working on this a while back,

1757
02:39:00,057 --> 02:39:02,418
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's been a long road, a lot of meetings.

1758
02:39:03,078 --> 02:39:05,099
[SPEAKER_16]: But I always looked at it as a beginning and not an end.

1759
02:39:05,219 --> 02:39:06,880
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think there's always room for improvement.

1760
02:39:07,400 --> 02:39:16,404
[SPEAKER_16]: I think Councilor Scott Pelley, by bringing this to subcommittee, we could talk and really talk about the different ideas that you have and how they'll work.

1761
02:39:16,624 --> 02:39:17,664
[SPEAKER_16]: They sound like great ideas.

1762
02:39:18,265 --> 02:39:20,986
[SPEAKER_16]: But I think it is imperative that we pass something sooner than later.

1763
02:39:21,586 --> 02:39:27,428
[SPEAKER_16]: But I just want to thank you for all your hard work and definitely look forward to working with you all in the future.

1764
02:39:27,608 --> 02:39:28,729
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you.

1765
02:39:33,370 --> 02:39:35,351
[SPEAKER_16]: We just have a quick question.

1766
02:39:35,511 --> 02:39:44,094
[SPEAKER_02]: I was wondering if we could get a copy of the proposed change to the amendment that hasn't been made public, that was brought up by the community development board.

1767
02:39:44,394 --> 02:39:46,094
[SPEAKER_16]: You mean the recommendations by the community development board?

1768
02:39:46,114 --> 02:39:51,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we have a project currently that we're using community preservation funds for in pre-development stage.

1769
02:39:51,236 --> 02:39:57,558
[SPEAKER_02]: And we want to be sure that those funds are not going to be jeopardized in the process of these changes.

1770
02:39:58,715 --> 02:40:02,676
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a lot of feedback in the microphone, so I apologize.

1771
02:40:02,816 --> 02:40:04,737
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen the changes that were proposed.

1772
02:40:04,777 --> 02:40:05,697
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, Councilor Knight.

1773
02:40:06,338 --> 02:40:14,160
[SPEAKER_18]: The majority of the changes just result to a timeline that the projects would have to be done within five years, that segmentation couldn't occur within five years.

1774
02:40:14,480 --> 02:40:19,762
[SPEAKER_18]: But I think if you give your name and address to the city messenger, well, you could take that right from the city solicitor right there.

1775
02:40:20,702 --> 02:40:21,283
[SPEAKER_18]: You might have it.

1776
02:40:22,623 --> 02:40:24,384
[SPEAKER_18]: Instant.

1777
02:40:24,704 --> 02:40:25,104
[SPEAKER_16]: OK.

1778
02:40:26,904 --> 02:40:28,465
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli.

1779
02:40:29,073 --> 02:40:47,265
[SPEAKER_16]: seconded by Consul DelaRusso and amended by Vice President Brianna Lungo-Kern that the Memphis City Council adopt the proposed amendment with changes recommended by the CD board in the February 19th correspondence.

1780
02:40:49,307 --> 02:40:52,129
[SPEAKER_16]: As amended by Vice President Lungo-Kern.

1781
02:40:53,630 --> 02:40:54,450
[SPEAKER_16]: Would you please call the roll?

1782
02:40:58,744 --> 02:40:59,385
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Caraviello?

1783
02:40:59,405 --> 02:40:59,465
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1784
02:41:00,445 --> 02:41:01,086
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor DelaRusso?

1785
02:41:01,106 --> 02:41:01,186
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1786
02:41:02,007 --> 02:41:02,507
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Knight?

1787
02:41:02,727 --> 02:41:02,907
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1788
02:41:03,328 --> 02:41:04,269
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Lungo Kern?

1789
02:41:04,309 --> 02:41:04,369
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1790
02:41:04,909 --> 02:41:05,430
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Marks?

1791
02:41:05,450 --> 02:41:05,850
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1792
02:41:06,390 --> 02:41:07,131
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1793
02:41:07,211 --> 02:41:07,351
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1794
02:41:07,611 --> 02:41:08,292
[SPEAKER_15]: President Falco?

1795
02:41:08,372 --> 02:41:08,612
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1796
02:41:09,033 --> 02:41:10,874
[SPEAKER_16]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1797
02:41:11,695 --> 02:41:12,475
[SPEAKER_16]: The amendment is adopted.

1798
02:41:13,036 --> 02:41:13,356
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1799
02:41:22,304 --> 02:41:25,927
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion to revert to the regular order of business, seconded by Councilor Knight.

1800
02:41:32,440 --> 02:41:35,522
[SPEAKER_16]: 19-053 offered by Councilor Carviello.

1801
02:41:36,783 --> 02:41:47,652
[SPEAKER_16]: Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council ask the DPW to move the 30 minutes parking sign in front of 451 High Street, as it has no spot since the bump out was installed.

1802
02:41:48,172 --> 02:41:49,193
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Carviello.

1803
02:41:49,513 --> 02:41:50,794
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, President Falco.

1804
02:41:52,295 --> 02:41:58,480
[SPEAKER_09]: As part of our Smart Street initiative, the bump outs were put into West Memphis Square.

1805
02:41:59,282 --> 02:42:03,583
[SPEAKER_09]: And unfortunately, the bump out is where the free 30-minute parking spot was.

1806
02:42:04,083 --> 02:42:18,186
[SPEAKER_09]: So if I could ask DPW to either remove one meter and move that sign up so the residents, so the business community can get that free 30-minute parking spot, it would be appreciated.

1807
02:42:19,086 --> 02:42:20,246
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Caviello.

1808
02:42:20,646 --> 02:42:23,006
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion of Councilor Caviello, seconded by Councilor Knight.

1809
02:42:23,086 --> 02:42:23,807
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

1810
02:42:24,127 --> 02:42:24,767
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

1811
02:42:25,287 --> 02:42:26,027
[SPEAKER_16]: The motion passes.

1812
02:42:27,920 --> 02:42:46,145
[SPEAKER_16]: 19-054 offered by Councilor Caviello be it resolved that the Memphis City Council request that our state representatives petition the DCR to install no truck parking on the Route 16 bypass as this has become a parking area for tractor trailers for several days at a time.

1813
02:42:46,845 --> 02:42:47,726
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Caviello.

1814
02:42:47,946 --> 02:42:48,946
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, President Falco.

1815
02:42:49,566 --> 02:42:56,328
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if anyone's noticed this, but over by the, by the DBW at Route 16, that's now become a,

1816
02:42:56,858 --> 02:43:00,762
[SPEAKER_09]: Tractor trailer parking spot, three, four, five days at a time.

1817
02:43:01,122 --> 02:43:03,184
[SPEAKER_09]: There's not been as many as three there.

1818
02:43:03,965 --> 02:43:12,472
[SPEAKER_09]: Car carrier, so it's bad enough that the former chief allowed the parking for the trailers on commercial street.

1819
02:43:13,273 --> 02:43:16,977
[SPEAKER_09]: Now we're having it on main thoroughfares.

1820
02:43:17,657 --> 02:43:21,260
[SPEAKER_09]: So I ask that we, where this is a state road,

1821
02:43:22,100 --> 02:43:31,326
[SPEAKER_09]: that we have the DCR put up no overnight trucking, no overnight truck parking in that area over by the DPW.

1822
02:43:31,727 --> 02:43:36,170
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, it's an eyesore to the community and say, we're not a truck stop.

1823
02:43:36,790 --> 02:43:44,515
[SPEAKER_09]: And like I said, it's bad enough that the former chief allowed the parking for trucks on the other street, but let's cut it down as much as we can.

1824
02:43:44,535 --> 02:43:51,020
[SPEAKER_16]: If you could please clarify, do you want the parking,

1825
02:43:52,262 --> 02:43:53,623
[SPEAKER_09]: No overnight truck parking.

1826
02:43:53,723 --> 02:43:54,964
[SPEAKER_16]: Overnight truck parking.

1827
02:43:57,266 --> 02:44:00,129
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion of Councilor Caviello, seconded by Councilor Knight.

1828
02:44:00,269 --> 02:44:01,010
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

1829
02:44:01,210 --> 02:44:01,950
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

1830
02:44:02,091 --> 02:44:02,931
[SPEAKER_16]: The motion passes.

1831
02:44:02,951 --> 02:44:05,233
[SPEAKER_16]: 19-055.

1832
02:44:08,396 --> 02:44:09,377
[SPEAKER_16]: Offered by Councilor Knight.

1833
02:44:09,517 --> 02:44:16,703
[SPEAKER_16]: Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council extends its deep and sincere condolences to the family of Thomas Kretz on his recent passing.

1834
02:44:18,244 --> 02:44:18,745
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Knight.

1835
02:44:20,327 --> 02:44:21,748
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1836
02:44:21,968 --> 02:44:23,710
[SPEAKER_18]: Recently, Mr. Kretz had passed away.

1837
02:44:24,250 --> 02:44:27,893
[SPEAKER_18]: We all know the Kretz family, having been involved here in Medford politics and government.

1838
02:44:28,693 --> 02:44:30,374
[SPEAKER_18]: Sister-in-law Kathy's on the school committee.

1839
02:44:30,394 --> 02:44:31,875
[SPEAKER_18]: Brother Danny is a firefighter.

1840
02:44:31,895 --> 02:44:34,137
[SPEAKER_18]: A number of nephews on the fire department as well.

1841
02:44:34,878 --> 02:44:37,519
[SPEAKER_18]: Tom was a great guy, a good stand-up member of our community.

1842
02:44:37,539 --> 02:44:38,400
[SPEAKER_18]: He'll be sadly missed.

1843
02:44:38,420 --> 02:44:39,721
[SPEAKER_18]: He's been taken from us too soon.

1844
02:44:40,341 --> 02:44:46,926
[SPEAKER_18]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I ask that my council colleagues join me in offering sincere and deep consolences to the family during their time of need.

1845
02:44:48,767 --> 02:44:49,288
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Council.

1846
02:44:51,761 --> 02:44:52,782
[SPEAKER_16]: Offered by Consular Marks.

1847
02:44:53,623 --> 02:44:58,746
[SPEAKER_16]: Be it resolved that a moment of silence be held for a longtime resident, Josephine Gilberto, on a recent passing.

1848
02:44:59,066 --> 02:44:59,666
[SPEAKER_16]: Consular Marks.

1849
02:45:01,667 --> 02:45:02,708
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1850
02:45:02,768 --> 02:45:04,749
[SPEAKER_11]: Josephine was a longtime Method resident.

1851
02:45:05,410 --> 02:45:09,392
[SPEAKER_11]: She was a beloved wife, mother, loving grandmother, and great-grandmother.

1852
02:45:10,173 --> 02:45:15,836
[SPEAKER_11]: And she was truly a tremendous woman, and she will be sorely missed in this community, Mr. President.

1853
02:45:17,607 --> 02:45:18,547
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1854
02:45:19,227 --> 02:45:42,371
[SPEAKER_16]: If we could all please rise for a moment of silence.

1855
02:45:42,851 --> 02:45:44,152
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Dela Rousseau.

1856
02:45:44,492 --> 02:45:46,292
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, last week,

1857
02:45:47,563 --> 02:46:07,669
[SPEAKER_19]: we were to have a presentation by representatives of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority to discuss the temporary movement of bus stops to accommodate for a changed bus route with regards to the Green Line project and the closure of the Broadway Bridge.

1858
02:46:08,089 --> 02:46:13,771
[SPEAKER_19]: Could we have that representative now out of order since he's been waiting here patiently for over a week?

1859
02:46:14,071 --> 02:46:14,431
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1860
02:46:14,811 --> 02:46:16,052
[SPEAKER_16]: So are you referring to,

1861
02:46:16,801 --> 02:46:16,901
[SPEAKER_16]: 19-058?

1862
02:46:16,961 --> 02:46:17,782
[SPEAKER_16]: I am now.

1863
02:46:17,842 --> 02:46:20,283
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, thank you.

1864
02:46:21,184 --> 02:46:25,946
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion of Councilor DelaRusso to suspend the rule, seconded by Councilor Scarapelli.

1865
02:46:25,986 --> 02:46:26,707
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

1866
02:46:26,767 --> 02:46:29,668
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

1867
02:46:29,688 --> 02:46:38,614
[SPEAKER_16]: 19-058, petition by the MBTA Service Planning Department to request four temporary bus stops for the diverted Route 80 bus route.

1868
02:46:41,955 --> 02:46:44,377
[SPEAKER_16]: Could you please have your name and address for the record, please?

1869
02:46:46,878 --> 02:46:47,318
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi.

1870
02:46:48,499 --> 02:46:49,439
[SPEAKER_22]: My name is Andrew Smith.

1871
02:46:50,580 --> 02:46:53,522
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm with the MBTA Department of Plans and Schedules.

1872
02:46:56,363 --> 02:47:01,286
[SPEAKER_22]: The address of the Planning and Scheduling Department is 45 High Street, Boston, Massachusetts.

1873
02:47:02,187 --> 02:47:05,108
[SPEAKER_22]: My home address is 73 Martin Street, Cambridge, Mass.

1874
02:47:08,330 --> 02:47:13,233
[SPEAKER_22]: Get this into focus here so everyone can see.

1875
02:47:19,112 --> 02:47:25,355
[SPEAKER_22]: So beginning, and sorry earlier for flashing the projector in your eyes.

1876
02:47:25,415 --> 02:47:27,856
[SPEAKER_22]: I didn't mean any offense on that.

1877
02:47:28,856 --> 02:47:34,799
[SPEAKER_22]: Beginning March 22nd, 2019, the Broadway Bridge in Ball Square is going to be closing.

1878
02:47:36,680 --> 02:47:47,945
[SPEAKER_22]: And it's going to be closing for approximately one year due to GLX construction, which means we're going to have to divert two bus routes that currently operate over the Broadway Bridge.

1879
02:47:49,148 --> 02:47:53,709
[SPEAKER_22]: One of these includes Route 80, which operates between Arlington Center and Lechmere.

1880
02:47:54,650 --> 02:48:04,032
[SPEAKER_22]: And the second route is Route 89, which includes two variants running to Sullivan Square from both Clarendon Hill and Davis.

1881
02:48:04,692 --> 02:48:06,833
[SPEAKER_22]: And that operates in Somerville only.

1882
02:48:08,233 --> 02:48:13,795
[SPEAKER_22]: So the T has developed diversion routes or detour routes

1883
02:48:14,449 --> 02:48:21,272
[SPEAKER_22]: around Ball Square to deal with this disruption for GLX construction.

1884
02:48:22,072 --> 02:48:26,675
[SPEAKER_22]: And we're going to be using minor arterials in both Medford and Somerville.

1885
02:48:27,555 --> 02:48:35,078
[SPEAKER_22]: The diversion routes are scheduled to take effect March 22nd, about a month from now.

1886
02:48:35,699 --> 02:48:43,082
[SPEAKER_22]: And these diversion routes have been tested by the bus training school so that in order to make sure that the turns work

1887
02:48:43,830 --> 02:48:45,891
[SPEAKER_22]: that the streets are wide enough to accommodate service.

1888
02:48:47,012 --> 02:48:54,016
[SPEAKER_22]: So we already have the new Route 80 on the spring schedule card with the Diversion Route shown.

1889
02:48:54,816 --> 02:48:58,398
[SPEAKER_22]: So the Diversion Route 80, which will be in effect for one year,

1890
02:48:59,657 --> 02:49:12,706
[SPEAKER_22]: is, you know, it's going to operate via College Ave, Main Street, and then down to Magoon Square, where it will resume the existing alignment.

1891
02:49:14,167 --> 02:49:26,656
[SPEAKER_22]: So what we're here to ask today is to locate a series of temporary bus stops in the city of Medford, four of them.

1892
02:49:28,650 --> 02:49:36,832
[SPEAKER_22]: One, the first series of temporary bus stops you'll see are in South Medford at Albion Street.

1893
02:49:37,292 --> 02:49:39,792
[SPEAKER_22]: They're those two stars that are just above Magoon Square.

1894
02:49:40,892 --> 02:49:55,495
[SPEAKER_22]: So on the inbound side, we're proposing one temporary bus stop with an actual bus stop sign, again, to be in effect for about a year on the far side of Albion Street.

1895
02:49:56,676 --> 02:49:58,076
[SPEAKER_22]: And then on the outbound direction,

1896
02:49:59,152 --> 02:50:02,693
[SPEAKER_22]: diagonally across the street on the far side of Hagen Street.

1897
02:50:03,293 --> 02:50:11,355
[SPEAKER_22]: And the berths will extend 60 feet forward from the corners to allow enough room for a single 40-foot bus to pull in.

1898
02:50:12,856 --> 02:50:17,197
[SPEAKER_22]: And this impacts about approximately three parking stalls on each side.

1899
02:50:17,917 --> 02:50:24,939
[SPEAKER_22]: The parking stalls aren't marked, but typically, you know, you want to have about 18 feet for a vehicle.

1900
02:50:26,182 --> 02:50:29,064
[SPEAKER_22]: That adds up to about three parking stalls.

1901
02:50:31,486 --> 02:50:40,573
[SPEAKER_22]: The second set of temporary stops, and let's just go back to the map here, is up on College Avenue near the Tufts Gymnasium.

1902
02:50:41,774 --> 02:50:47,538
[SPEAKER_22]: You see those two stars that are just to the right of the Tufts University icon.

1903
02:50:49,139 --> 02:50:53,562
[SPEAKER_22]: And those stops are going to be located

1904
02:50:55,015 --> 02:50:58,178
[SPEAKER_22]: on the inbound direction, mid-block in lane.

1905
02:50:58,258 --> 02:51:01,720
[SPEAKER_22]: So there are actually no parking impacts on that one.

1906
02:51:01,760 --> 02:51:10,928
[SPEAKER_22]: That's located, I'd say about 150 feet to the west of Frederick Ave.

1907
02:51:11,969 --> 02:51:19,995
[SPEAKER_22]: So it's in kind of a planted area with lighting alongside the fence for the Tufts University parking lot.

1908
02:51:21,467 --> 02:51:23,287
[SPEAKER_22]: This would be a 40-foot berth in lane.

1909
02:51:24,108 --> 02:51:25,928
[SPEAKER_22]: There would be a temporary bus stop installed.

1910
02:51:25,948 --> 02:51:28,528
[SPEAKER_22]: And again, there would be no parking impacts on the inbound side.

1911
02:51:29,129 --> 02:51:32,969
[SPEAKER_22]: On the outbound side, we are proposing a temporary far side stop.

1912
02:51:33,029 --> 02:51:37,730
[SPEAKER_22]: It would extend about 60 feet forward from the Elliot Pearson School driveway.

1913
02:51:38,530 --> 02:51:46,552
[SPEAKER_22]: And this temporary berth would require about one to two metered parking stalls to be removed.

1914
02:51:48,242 --> 02:51:50,043
[SPEAKER_22]: It's the kiosk style metering.

1915
02:51:51,103 --> 02:51:56,386
[SPEAKER_22]: The kiosk, I think, is right in front of the stairs that lead up to the Tufts gymnasium.

1916
02:51:56,446 --> 02:52:07,431
[SPEAKER_22]: So this would impact a couple of parking spaces, but we felt that this would be probably the most appropriate location for temporary bus stops.

1917
02:52:08,492 --> 02:52:11,073
[SPEAKER_22]: And just to kind of go over the reasoning for the temporary bus stops,

1918
02:52:11,912 --> 02:52:23,147
[SPEAKER_22]: The reason for the temporary bus stops at Albion Street is because Route 80 service center around Ball Square is going to be disrupted, so we want to make sure that

1919
02:52:23,886 --> 02:52:35,335
[SPEAKER_22]: People who live in South Medford near Tufts Square, near Albion Street, have an easy way of getting on the bus, Route 80, to go to Lechmere or to Arlington Center.

1920
02:52:36,796 --> 02:52:49,305
[SPEAKER_22]: And then up at College Ave, it gives anyone who lives near Tufts University the option of boarding the Route 80 and College Ave.

1921
02:52:50,311 --> 02:52:52,612
[SPEAKER_22]: So that is the presentation.

1922
02:52:52,712 --> 02:52:55,112
[SPEAKER_22]: If you guys have any questions, feel free to ask.

1923
02:53:03,454 --> 02:53:13,176
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, these changes have had ample time for citizen input, and the Citizen Advisory Committee that serves for the Green Line Extension Project

1924
02:53:13,961 --> 02:53:32,812
[SPEAKER_19]: Consideration was given to great detail as far as service area radius, the number of riders who board these buses from their sources and was given due consideration by the route department of the MBTA with their efficiency that they're known for.

1925
02:53:33,332 --> 02:53:38,975
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think we have a good plan here and they just take

1926
02:53:40,017 --> 02:53:47,882
[SPEAKER_19]: The only reason for these four, I should say, temporary spots is because they're where the buses are being rerouted.

1927
02:53:48,662 --> 02:53:53,525
[SPEAKER_19]: These are the only areas that don't have bus routes on them, so they need temporary spots.

1928
02:53:54,046 --> 02:54:01,590
[SPEAKER_19]: My only recommendation, Mr. President, is that we set a limitation for these temporary bus stops at one year.

1929
02:54:03,031 --> 02:54:06,273
[SPEAKER_19]: And if they need an extension, they may approach the city council.

1930
02:54:16,813 --> 02:54:17,674
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Scott Pelley.

1931
02:54:18,815 --> 02:54:19,195
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1932
02:54:20,176 --> 02:54:38,733
[SPEAKER_07]: My question to ask my colleague, I have those residents that live in that area that will be affected, if they've been notified by the T, not by some social media or

1933
02:54:40,672 --> 02:54:44,836
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I understand that, but have we gone directly to those affected?

1934
02:54:44,876 --> 02:54:45,736
[SPEAKER_07]: That'll be right in front.

1935
02:54:45,756 --> 02:54:51,762
[SPEAKER_07]: Have we given those people the ample understanding that this is happening in front of their homes?

1936
02:54:53,263 --> 02:54:55,565
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no.

1937
02:54:56,146 --> 02:55:06,475
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a tough time moving anything forward, and I appreciate social media, I appreciate the meetings, but the truth of the matter is,

1938
02:55:08,146 --> 02:55:16,309
[SPEAKER_07]: the majority of some people that are in that area, unless it doesn't affect them, they're really not going and really not paying attention to this.

1939
02:55:17,269 --> 02:55:18,709
[SPEAKER_07]: This is affecting them, they don't even know it.

1940
02:55:19,550 --> 02:55:21,670
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that we need to do a better job.

1941
02:55:22,090 --> 02:55:30,333
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not comfortable moving forward with this without those individuals, especially directly involved,

1942
02:55:31,295 --> 02:55:34,558
[SPEAKER_07]: are informed by the team that this is what's happening.

1943
02:55:34,698 --> 02:55:48,049
[SPEAKER_07]: So other than that, I know that there's some other concerns about some, are there other stops that are being excluded that have no effect from this project in that area?

1944
02:55:48,069 --> 02:55:48,589
[SPEAKER_07]: Or is it?

1945
02:55:51,531 --> 02:55:51,912
[SPEAKER_07]: There is.

1946
02:55:56,395 --> 02:55:58,337
[SPEAKER_07]: Could you explain, do you have any detail on that?

1947
02:56:03,110 --> 02:56:24,168
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the city traffic engineer has better knowledge of this, because I got a notification through an outside source, and there were some glaring omissions in this meeting that there has been some changes that should be highlighted.

1948
02:56:25,249 --> 02:56:29,193
[SPEAKER_07]: So if maybe the traffic engineer can expand on that.

1949
02:56:30,777 --> 02:56:31,938
[SPEAKER_20]: So I will try.

1950
02:56:32,839 --> 02:56:40,871
[SPEAKER_20]: So what we did not mention is there are a number of white dots on Main Street that are existing bus stops that already serve the Route 101.

1951
02:56:42,488 --> 02:56:48,511
[SPEAKER_20]: So the starred locations are just to supplement bus stops that are already on Main Street and George Street.

1952
02:56:49,251 --> 02:56:53,913
[SPEAKER_20]: So the existing Route 80 goes down the dash section that he has on the map.

1953
02:56:54,273 --> 02:56:59,155
[SPEAKER_20]: So those little Xs outlined, correct me if I'm wrong.

1954
02:56:59,175 --> 02:56:59,896
[SPEAKER_20]: Those are the closed stops.

1955
02:56:59,916 --> 02:57:08,479
[SPEAKER_20]: Those are the closed stops that are on the current Route 80 route that eventually ends up at Tufts University call out up at the northwest corner.

1956
02:57:09,000 --> 02:57:09,920
[SPEAKER_20]: So this route,

1957
02:57:11,128 --> 02:57:23,025
[SPEAKER_20]: The T had come to the city before and proposed option A through G I think it was for routes for the 80 and 89 and this was the most palatable to the community.

1958
02:57:24,652 --> 02:57:26,413
[SPEAKER_20]: with the limited options that are available.

1959
02:57:27,033 --> 02:57:35,796
[SPEAKER_20]: So for instance, at one point, there was an option to go down Harvard Street, but considering all the issues on Harvard Street, it was deemed to go this way instead.

1960
02:57:37,357 --> 02:57:46,560
[SPEAKER_20]: So the added temporary bus stops are just to close the gap between where the existing stops are on Medford Street in Somerville and Boston Ave in Medford.

1961
02:57:47,535 --> 02:57:53,817
[SPEAKER_20]: There are stops on Main Street in the middle of that map that serve the 101 that would also now serve the 80.

1962
02:57:54,817 --> 02:58:02,780
[SPEAKER_20]: And the gold star areas are the section that they were deemed to be gaps between existing stops that were too long for the community to walk.

1963
02:58:04,200 --> 02:58:08,961
[SPEAKER_20]: Does that address concerns a bit or explain it a bit better?

1964
02:58:12,317 --> 02:58:18,081
[SPEAKER_20]: So the Route 80 currently goes along the dash line from Magoon Square to Tufts University College.

1965
02:58:18,121 --> 02:58:18,861
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

1966
02:58:19,462 --> 02:58:29,068
[SPEAKER_07]: So were there any stops eliminated in Medford that will divert to the new stops?

1967
02:58:29,629 --> 02:58:32,551
[SPEAKER_20]: I believe all of those are technically in Somerville.

1968
02:58:32,871 --> 02:58:35,693
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm looking at this map right here because the city line is

1969
02:58:36,753 --> 02:58:43,016
[SPEAKER_20]: is in the vicinity of Dearborn Ave and College Ave, which is just north of those two yellow stops.

1970
02:58:43,477 --> 02:58:47,059
[SPEAKER_20]: So the two yellow Xs under the Tufts University call out.

1971
02:58:47,799 --> 02:58:50,420
[SPEAKER_20]: I believe those are the College Ave and Dearborn.

1972
02:58:50,681 --> 02:58:51,861
[SPEAKER_20]: Dearborn and Professor's Row.

1973
02:58:51,881 --> 02:58:53,742
[SPEAKER_20]: Which I believe is technically Somerville.

1974
02:58:53,762 --> 02:58:57,284
[SPEAKER_20]: The line is right in that vicinity, so it's very close to Medford.

1975
02:58:57,624 --> 02:59:04,708
[SPEAKER_20]: And on the Magoon Square end, I believe the two Xs close to Magoon Square are technically Somerville as well and Broadway.

1976
02:59:05,129 --> 02:59:12,792
[SPEAKER_20]: So they're all along Broadway, and the city line, as most of you know, is maybe 20 feet back from the back of Sidewalk on Broadway, most of the way.

1977
02:59:15,273 --> 02:59:17,334
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'm just looking here.

1978
02:59:18,434 --> 02:59:20,395
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I believe those are all some of those stops.

1979
02:59:21,272 --> 02:59:28,757
[SPEAKER_20]: But for folks, depending on where they live in Medford, the old stop may have been closer to them than some of these new stops.

1980
02:59:29,157 --> 02:59:33,619
[SPEAKER_20]: And we realize that's a trade-off, but given the limited streets to choose from.

1981
02:59:33,639 --> 02:59:40,063
[SPEAKER_20]: So if someone lives on, say, Bristol Road, it'll be a longer walk than they normally would have.

1982
02:59:40,364 --> 02:59:46,447
[SPEAKER_20]: But if someone lives on Albion off of Main Street, they'll have a closer walk because there'll be a new temporary stop there.

1983
02:59:47,808 --> 02:59:50,930
[SPEAKER_20]: So you're definitely, you know, Frederick, Pearl,

1984
02:59:51,367 --> 02:59:58,272
[SPEAKER_20]: all those side streets will have a better access to Route 80, whereas they normally would have had to walk up to the corner of College Ave and Boston Ave.

1985
02:59:59,053 --> 03:00:06,719
[SPEAKER_20]: So there'll be some that are a little further away, and some of Medford residents will be closer, if that helps.

1986
03:00:06,739 --> 03:00:12,383
[SPEAKER_20]: The Route 89, obviously, Andy mentioned earlier, that's fully contained within Somerville.

1987
03:00:14,665 --> 03:00:17,027
[SPEAKER_07]: So the Route 90, that has nothing to do with this right now?

1988
03:00:17,742 --> 03:00:18,962
[SPEAKER_20]: No, Route 90 would not be affected.

1989
03:00:19,002 --> 03:00:19,162
[SPEAKER_20]: No.

1990
03:00:19,322 --> 03:00:19,963
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, so the route.

1991
03:00:20,283 --> 03:00:25,664
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, now I know you're mentioning, Councilor, I'm sorry, that I didn't put the two and two together.

1992
03:00:25,684 --> 03:00:30,325
[SPEAKER_20]: There's a separate process other than what's being presented tonight.

1993
03:00:30,365 --> 03:00:35,166
[SPEAKER_20]: This is only for GLX-related diversion for the Route 80 in relation to the bridge closure.

1994
03:00:35,186 --> 03:00:40,047
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, so the better bus program has nothing to do, which isn't better bus for Method residents?

1995
03:00:40,087 --> 03:00:40,287
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that?

1996
03:00:40,547 --> 03:00:41,047
[SPEAKER_07]: The better bus.

1997
03:00:41,067 --> 03:00:42,347
[SPEAKER_07]: This has nothing to do with this, then?

1998
03:00:42,387 --> 03:00:43,588
[SPEAKER_20]: This has nothing to do with that.

1999
03:00:43,728 --> 03:00:44,468
[SPEAKER_20]: But it's, you know.

2000
03:00:45,103 --> 03:00:48,826
[SPEAKER_20]: It's good that you brought it up because we could... Well, I have you here.

2001
03:00:48,946 --> 03:00:50,487
[SPEAKER_07]: It's tough.

2002
03:00:50,928 --> 03:01:00,135
[SPEAKER_07]: No disrespect to you, but as a transportation subcommittee chairperson, we've asked many times for the T to come to us, and many times that didn't happen.

2003
03:01:00,815 --> 03:01:03,357
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's been a little frustrating, to be honest with you.

2004
03:01:03,397 --> 03:01:10,643
[SPEAKER_20]: So now that you're here... So for those of you who don't know, there's a better bus program that the T is proposing.

2005
03:01:11,744 --> 03:01:12,545
[SPEAKER_20]: So it involves...

2006
03:01:13,720 --> 03:01:19,063
[SPEAKER_20]: upwards of 45 route changes, but in Medford, I believe it's maybe a handful, half dozen.

2007
03:01:19,883 --> 03:01:25,146
[SPEAKER_20]: One of them is the Route 90, and that does definitely have impacts to city of Medford residents.

2008
03:01:25,947 --> 03:01:34,051
[SPEAKER_20]: The 90 currently goes from Davis Square to Wellington Station, and it stops off at Sullivan and through assembly area.

2009
03:01:34,511 --> 03:01:35,892
[SPEAKER_20]: And the proposal is to

2010
03:01:36,453 --> 03:01:37,835
[SPEAKER_20]: truncated at assembly.

2011
03:01:37,855 --> 03:01:41,158
[SPEAKER_20]: So go Davis to assembly and not to Wellington station.

2012
03:01:41,339 --> 03:01:52,351
[SPEAKER_07]: Just for the sake of time, is this something that's going to, you're bringing this to us, Mr. Blake, is this something that we can call for a subcommittee so we can inform our constituents that this is happening?

2013
03:01:52,651 --> 03:01:57,477
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause this is, this is more of a, uh, a daunting, you know, um,

2014
03:01:58,948 --> 03:02:00,789
[SPEAKER_07]: issue than what we're talking about today.

2015
03:02:00,869 --> 03:02:02,669
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't want to muddy both.

2016
03:02:02,749 --> 03:02:03,750
[SPEAKER_20]: I could speak for myself.

2017
03:02:03,810 --> 03:02:05,550
[SPEAKER_20]: I'd be happy to attend the subcommittee meeting.

2018
03:02:06,250 --> 03:02:17,014
[SPEAKER_20]: As far as the MBTA, I did make a request through the senior director of service planning to have a public meeting in Medford about better bus program.

2019
03:02:17,814 --> 03:02:28,037
[SPEAKER_20]: And the response I got was, unfortunately, they're a bit booked up, but there's several existing community meetings in the area that Medford residents may

2020
03:02:28,743 --> 03:02:30,805
[SPEAKER_20]: take advantage of one I think is involved in?

2021
03:02:31,305 --> 03:02:41,314
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how my colleagues feel about that, but I'm not comfortable voting for one and getting that response about something that's more important on our streets later.

2022
03:02:41,394 --> 03:02:50,802
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe we wait and bring them all together and we talk to, you know, get this, get all the answers we need at one meeting if that's the case.

2023
03:02:50,842 --> 03:02:56,767
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not, I'm not willing, if that's, unfortunately that's what it seems that we have to, you know,

2024
03:02:57,639 --> 03:03:08,362
[SPEAKER_07]: have one for the other to have them sit in front of us, because I think the better bus route is something that's going to affect more of our residents than this diagram.

2025
03:03:08,382 --> 03:03:25,928
[SPEAKER_07]: This diagram, this proposal, I think if we reach out to those two or four families, I don't think it's just making them understood that in front of their homes for a year, there'll be a bus stop now, and letting them understand that as an amendment, I wouldn't bark at that.

2026
03:03:28,127 --> 03:03:40,976
[SPEAKER_07]: What bothers me more right now is the fact that representatives from the T have told you that they can't accommodate a meeting in Medford where this is affecting Medford and our residents.

2027
03:03:41,197 --> 03:03:42,678
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe I'm wrong.

2028
03:03:42,698 --> 03:03:43,338
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

2029
03:03:43,378 --> 03:03:46,641
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe my colleagues can tell me I'm wrong, but I feel strongly about this.

2030
03:03:48,582 --> 03:03:56,248
[SPEAKER_20]: As a point of information for timing, I believe the Better Bus Program, they were hoping to go to their board in April.

2031
03:03:56,775 --> 03:04:01,716
[SPEAKER_20]: So whatever we have internally should be coming up soon.

2032
03:04:02,256 --> 03:04:06,517
[SPEAKER_20]: I've been trying to spread the word out about the better bus program to solicit feedback.

2033
03:04:06,557 --> 03:04:17,180
[SPEAKER_20]: The T has it on their website and some other sources to solicit feedback from the city as a government agency, but also from the residents.

2034
03:04:17,800 --> 03:04:22,461
[SPEAKER_07]: If I can though, it's important that we know because there's a lot of people watching this in that area.

2035
03:04:23,001 --> 03:04:26,502
[SPEAKER_07]: And it'd be nice that the counselors who talk to people on a daily basis

2036
03:04:27,107 --> 03:04:29,268
[SPEAKER_07]: understand that this is coming about.

2037
03:04:30,908 --> 03:04:31,828
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we get the calls.

2038
03:04:32,168 --> 03:04:39,590
[SPEAKER_07]: When it's all said and done, it's us who sit behind this reel, we'll get the phone calls and say, hey, what just happened to my stop?

2039
03:04:40,311 --> 03:04:41,271
[SPEAKER_07]: Why is this?

2040
03:04:41,391 --> 03:04:42,291
[SPEAKER_07]: Why is x?

2041
03:04:42,371 --> 03:04:42,911
[SPEAKER_07]: Why is z?

2042
03:04:43,331 --> 03:04:47,593
[SPEAKER_07]: So again, I apologize for my

2043
03:04:50,099 --> 03:04:56,764
[SPEAKER_07]: intense attitude, but it's something that we've seen in the past that it's, it's, it affects our residents.

2044
03:04:56,784 --> 03:05:03,109
[SPEAKER_07]: So I know some councilors a little irritated with that, but I, you have to understand that at this point right now, that's where I stand.

2045
03:05:03,169 --> 03:05:04,690
[SPEAKER_07]: So I will not support this.

2046
03:05:06,772 --> 03:05:07,052
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2047
03:05:07,072 --> 03:05:09,734
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Scarpelli, Vice President Lugo-Kern.

2048
03:05:10,274 --> 03:05:12,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, President Falco.

2049
03:05:12,496 --> 03:05:19,201
[SPEAKER_03]: My questions were along the same lines as Councilor Scarpelli's, because if you, if you look at the fourth request,

2050
03:05:19,940 --> 03:05:29,164
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems like the only, no spots are being impacted, no parking spots, and I'm assuming that you've discussed this with Tufts University?

2051
03:05:30,484 --> 03:05:43,829
[SPEAKER_20]: Tufts University has a member on the community working group meeting, Rocco Durico, so he's aware of it, and they attend regular community meetings with the GLX project, so I believe they are, yes.

2052
03:05:45,390 --> 03:05:47,991
[SPEAKER_03]: So for the fourth one, as long as Rocco and Tufts

2053
03:05:49,707 --> 03:05:57,532
[SPEAKER_03]: is aware of this and you're not losing any spots, it seems logical and it seems like something that can be discussed and reviewed.

2054
03:05:58,933 --> 03:06:06,177
[SPEAKER_03]: The third request seems like it's probably the second minimal impact with regards to neighborhood or parking.

2055
03:06:07,558 --> 03:06:13,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's going to affect some traffic flow because that's not as wide as you'd hope a bus route would be.

2056
03:06:15,307 --> 03:06:18,089
[SPEAKER_03]: And if there are any residents, you can't really see in the picture.

2057
03:06:18,189 --> 03:06:23,654
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems like you're almost getting to the area where the homes begin across the street from Tufts.

2058
03:06:23,714 --> 03:06:26,376
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would want them to be notified.

2059
03:06:26,396 --> 03:06:37,945
[SPEAKER_03]: I really think there should be a public meeting with regards to that one, if there's any resident homes that are being affected, as well as Main and Albion.

2060
03:06:39,626 --> 03:06:44,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Six parking spots being impacted on Main Street and Albion.

2061
03:06:44,950 --> 03:06:55,833
[SPEAKER_03]: That is an area that I don't think can afford any lost parking spots, so I would definitely want notification to the residents in just some sort of public meeting.

2062
03:06:56,553 --> 03:07:02,295
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we're on a time crunch, because the bridge is closing in, jeez, 32 days.

2063
03:07:02,475 --> 03:07:03,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, the bridge is closing.

2064
03:07:03,895 --> 03:07:07,056
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not sure why this is coming to us so late.

2065
03:07:07,176 --> 03:07:12,118
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish this was a couple months ago, because even if the council did the due diligence

2066
03:07:12,955 --> 03:07:16,137
[SPEAKER_03]: notified the residents and brought them in to discuss concerns.

2067
03:07:18,559 --> 03:07:21,901
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's something we could do or the subcommittee at least could do.

2068
03:07:23,121 --> 03:07:28,565
[SPEAKER_03]: But where you have 30 days now, it's really unfortunate that resident homes are going to be affected.

2069
03:07:28,705 --> 03:07:31,807
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we have this time crunch issue.

2070
03:07:31,827 --> 03:07:33,588
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they need to be notified.

2071
03:07:33,608 --> 03:07:41,493
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they should be notified as soon as possible so that at least they have a place where they can voice their concerns and questions and at least

2072
03:07:41,980 --> 03:07:46,223
[SPEAKER_03]: know that their homes are going to be affected, their parking spots are going to be affected.

2073
03:07:46,263 --> 03:07:49,946
[SPEAKER_03]: They could come to the council with concerns so we could try to resolve the issues.

2074
03:07:51,267 --> 03:07:52,548
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is my concern, too.

2075
03:07:52,648 --> 03:07:57,812
[SPEAKER_03]: It's unfortunate that we're getting this 30 days prior on something so serious.

2076
03:07:58,673 --> 03:08:04,137
[SPEAKER_03]: And it probably definitely needs to be done when you look at the rerouting due to the bridge closure.

2077
03:08:04,237 --> 03:08:08,100
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just want to second Councillor Scarapelli's

2078
03:08:10,057 --> 03:08:22,542
[SPEAKER_03]: concern and hope that a public meeting with notification to those specific residents on Main Street, Albion, and College Ave be addressed.

2079
03:08:22,602 --> 03:08:22,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

2080
03:08:24,202 --> 03:08:24,963
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Vice President.

2081
03:08:25,003 --> 03:08:25,643
[SPEAKER_16]: Alongo Kern.

2082
03:08:25,863 --> 03:08:26,683
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Caviello.

2083
03:08:27,644 --> 03:08:28,584
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, President Falco.

2084
03:08:29,344 --> 03:08:34,266
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm glad that he's in a rush tonight, because I'm not in too much of a rush for this.

2085
03:08:36,247 --> 03:08:38,108
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, you're talking about moving the bus stops.

2086
03:08:39,720 --> 03:08:53,703
[SPEAKER_09]: I think in our haste to do all this work here, nobody has informed the people that live in Pearl, Stanley, all those in George Street, and all those little side streets there.

2087
03:08:54,263 --> 03:08:59,205
[SPEAKER_09]: They have no idea that College Avenue is not going to be a major thoroughfare.

2088
03:08:59,965 --> 03:09:03,886
[SPEAKER_09]: I've talked to people over there, and they're saying, what are you talking about?

2089
03:09:03,906 --> 03:09:09,407
[SPEAKER_09]: Someone's got to notify all those residents of all those stairings and all those side streets there.

2090
03:09:09,774 --> 03:09:11,855
[SPEAKER_09]: along College Ave, that this is happening.

2091
03:09:12,136 --> 03:09:13,176
[SPEAKER_09]: Those people have no idea.

2092
03:09:16,058 --> 03:09:17,399
[SPEAKER_09]: Never mind the bus stop.

2093
03:09:18,820 --> 03:09:24,644
[SPEAKER_09]: But when I talk to people, and they're telling me about all the constant, they say, what are you talking about?

2094
03:09:24,664 --> 03:09:30,268
[SPEAKER_09]: They have no idea that this is even, that in 30 days, that College Ave is going to become a major thoroughfare there.

2095
03:09:32,129 --> 03:09:35,491
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't know why no one has reached out to those people and informed them about this.

2096
03:09:36,292 --> 03:09:38,493
[SPEAKER_09]: I went to Councilor Schiapelli and Councilor Lungo.

2097
03:09:40,553 --> 03:09:45,577
[SPEAKER_09]: Until there's some notification for these people about what's happening here, I can't support anything here.

2098
03:09:45,597 --> 03:09:49,581
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I don't know why the T waited so long to come to us to do this.

2099
03:09:49,641 --> 03:09:56,046
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, Councilor Scott Pelli has called the T on multiple occasions, and we couldn't even get a return phone call.

2100
03:09:57,287 --> 03:09:59,989
[SPEAKER_09]: And now you're here today in a rush.

2101
03:10:01,650 --> 03:10:05,213
[SPEAKER_09]: I asked to, I'm on my third week here, asking for a sign to be moved.

2102
03:10:05,713 --> 03:10:07,135
[SPEAKER_09]: And a sign has been moved.

2103
03:10:07,315 --> 03:10:07,595
[SPEAKER_22]: Which one?

2104
03:10:08,130 --> 03:10:10,611
[SPEAKER_09]: on High Street and Medford and West 7th Square.

2105
03:10:12,612 --> 03:10:13,312
[SPEAKER_09]: We put in for that.

2106
03:10:14,412 --> 03:10:19,994
[SPEAKER_09]: And I said, all I had to do, it's a 10 minute job to move two signs, to move the bus stop back to where it used to be.

2107
03:10:21,315 --> 03:10:33,039
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, I say, I'm not supporting anything until the people on all those streets off of College Ave get some kind of notification on what's coming their way for the next year.

2108
03:10:37,909 --> 03:10:39,070
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Carriello.

2109
03:10:39,610 --> 03:10:40,111
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Knight.

2110
03:10:40,791 --> 03:10:42,052
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

2111
03:10:42,293 --> 03:10:47,117
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to preface my statement by saying I'm very excited about the Green Line coming to the city of Medford.

2112
03:10:47,237 --> 03:10:49,759
[SPEAKER_18]: However, the planning process is a very difficult one.

2113
03:10:50,620 --> 03:11:00,067
[SPEAKER_18]: So with that being said, is there any indication that by putting these stops temporarily in the city of Medford that they'd have an impact on our annual MBTA assessment?

2114
03:11:02,610 --> 03:11:02,770
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

2115
03:11:02,990 --> 03:11:05,212
[SPEAKER_22]: No, they would not have an impact on the assessment.

2116
03:11:05,692 --> 03:11:06,773
[SPEAKER_18]: Confident in that answer?

2117
03:11:07,558 --> 03:11:07,818
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry.

2118
03:11:07,838 --> 03:11:08,639
[SPEAKER_18]: You're confident with that answer?

2119
03:11:08,659 --> 03:11:08,819
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

2120
03:11:09,039 --> 03:11:09,980
[SPEAKER_18]: OK.

2121
03:11:10,421 --> 03:11:12,603
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, ultimately, this is the route that you're proposing.

2122
03:11:12,663 --> 03:11:15,145
[SPEAKER_18]: Boston Ave, George Street, Main Street, Medford Street.

2123
03:11:15,866 --> 03:11:17,687
[SPEAKER_18]: Boston Ave, College Street, George Street, Main Street, Medford Street.

2124
03:11:17,707 --> 03:11:20,530
[SPEAKER_18]: And you're asking us to put five temporary stops in, right?

2125
03:11:21,631 --> 03:11:21,911
[SPEAKER_22]: Four.

2126
03:11:22,051 --> 03:11:22,312
[SPEAKER_18]: Four.

2127
03:11:22,332 --> 03:11:24,414
[SPEAKER_22]: Four in the city of Medford.

2128
03:11:24,534 --> 03:11:26,015
[SPEAKER_22]: That fifth one is in Somerville.

2129
03:11:26,075 --> 03:11:27,296
[SPEAKER_18]: And if we don't put them in, what happens?

2130
03:11:27,356 --> 03:11:28,077
[SPEAKER_18]: Is that still the route?

2131
03:11:28,284 --> 03:11:31,885
[SPEAKER_18]: Is the route still going to be the route, whether or not we put the temporary spots in or not?

2132
03:11:32,085 --> 03:11:38,186
[SPEAKER_22]: Route 80 must continue between Lechmere and Arlington Center on some route.

2133
03:11:38,346 --> 03:11:45,388
[SPEAKER_22]: And we felt that this was the most appropriate course of action, given that George Street and Main Street already carry MBTA bus routes.

2134
03:11:45,468 --> 03:11:48,669
[SPEAKER_22]: George Street carries Route 96, and then Main Street carries 101.

2135
03:11:51,829 --> 03:11:53,910
[SPEAKER_22]: College Ave does not carry a bus route.

2136
03:11:54,518 --> 03:11:56,259
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, but I mean, ultimately, this is the route.

2137
03:11:56,339 --> 03:11:57,119
[SPEAKER_18]: This is what you're going with.

2138
03:11:57,179 --> 03:12:00,301
[SPEAKER_18]: Regardless of whether or not we give you these bus stops or not, this is the route you're going with.

2139
03:12:01,181 --> 03:12:03,943
[SPEAKER_23]: This is the route we would like to go with, yes.

2140
03:12:04,723 --> 03:12:06,104
[SPEAKER_23]: And I can touch base with that.

2141
03:12:06,564 --> 03:12:15,768
[SPEAKER_20]: In the GLX process with the internal technical meetings, the public meetings, and the community working group meetings, this is the route that was flushed out of that process.

2142
03:12:15,888 --> 03:12:20,911
[SPEAKER_18]: OK, because I mean, and looking at the 80 bus route and the direction that it goes in, and I'm pretty familiar with Somerville.

2143
03:12:20,931 --> 03:12:23,272
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, I worked in Ball Square for a long time for Charlie Shannon.

2144
03:12:24,340 --> 03:12:29,982
[SPEAKER_18]: pretty familiar with the MBTA and the way the MBTA works, but ultimately, and I'm familiar with the 80 bus route because I'm from West Medford.

2145
03:12:30,362 --> 03:12:36,804
[SPEAKER_18]: So ultimately, if you look at this, right, you got a bus coming down Broadway and it gets to the Broadway Bridge and it can't go over it anymore.

2146
03:12:36,844 --> 03:12:40,064
[SPEAKER_18]: But right before Broadway, we have Cedar Street, which is an emergency way in the city of Somerville.

2147
03:12:40,685 --> 03:12:52,748
[SPEAKER_18]: And I don't understand why a bus couldn't be diverted down Cedar Street and then take a right on Morrison Ave and then be diverted right down Willow Ave and you'd be cutting out two blocks where the Broadway Bridge is instead of sending this thing for six miles through the city of Medford.

2148
03:12:53,368 --> 03:12:54,168
[SPEAKER_22]: That's a valid point.

2149
03:12:54,209 --> 03:12:54,909
[SPEAKER_22]: We looked at that.

2150
03:12:54,929 --> 03:13:00,372
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, Cedar street is actually going to carry route 89, um, on it's the version.

2151
03:13:00,652 --> 03:13:00,872
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

2152
03:13:00,912 --> 03:13:09,357
[SPEAKER_22]: So, well, you talked about the city, the streets, the Alderman and Somerville were, were opposed to using those, those, those, those local streets.

2153
03:13:09,377 --> 03:13:12,879
[SPEAKER_18]: Cause the counselors in Medford are opposed to this plan right here.

2154
03:13:13,039 --> 03:13:13,320
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

2155
03:13:13,820 --> 03:13:22,465
[SPEAKER_18]: So, you know, ultimately, I guess Mark need a gang in his opinion about diverting this thing through Medford for this huge duration of what looks like one, two, three, four, five,

2156
03:13:23,112 --> 03:13:28,556
[SPEAKER_18]: 12 or 13 or 14 or 15 stops is the plan because the alderman in the city of Somerville was opposed to it.

2157
03:13:28,577 --> 03:13:31,018
[SPEAKER_18]: So they're going to divert it through 15 stops with the city of Medford.

2158
03:13:31,419 --> 03:13:36,663
[SPEAKER_18]: When the bypass that I just gave you would bypass two stops in the city of Somerville and put it right back on track in the 80 track.

2159
03:13:37,123 --> 03:13:37,744
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm no engineer.

2160
03:13:37,784 --> 03:13:38,604
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm no traffic engineer.

2161
03:13:38,624 --> 03:13:39,465
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what you guys are for.

2162
03:13:39,485 --> 03:13:40,606
[SPEAKER_18]: You guys are the big brains in the room.

2163
03:13:40,986 --> 03:13:43,969
[SPEAKER_18]: But in looking at this thing, it doesn't look like it makes any sense to me at all.

2164
03:13:44,869 --> 03:13:49,333
[SPEAKER_18]: So ultimately, if we don't approve the temporary bus stops, you're still going to go full with this route.

2165
03:13:50,033 --> 03:13:51,995
[SPEAKER_18]: So this route's going to cause the impact on the community.

2166
03:13:53,010 --> 03:13:55,631
[SPEAKER_18]: If we don't approve the bus stops, we don't approve the bus stops.

2167
03:13:56,352 --> 03:14:04,315
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't understand what the big deal is, but it doesn't look to me like the bus stops that they're putting in there are going to be servicing a Medford population that was previously using the 80 bus line anyhow.

2168
03:14:05,176 --> 03:14:13,900
[SPEAKER_18]: So I don't see anybody from the city of Medford being impacted negatively if we deny the temporary bus stops at this point in time, based upon what I can see on this.

2169
03:14:14,260 --> 03:14:19,642
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that the rerouting of the 80 bus and the route that you came up with is absolutely ridiculous.

2170
03:14:19,662 --> 03:14:20,883
[SPEAKER_18]: It makes no sense to me whatsoever.

2171
03:14:21,323 --> 03:14:25,426
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, it wasn't our preferred option going in, but this was the result.

2172
03:14:27,628 --> 03:14:30,510
[SPEAKER_18]: So with that being said, I don't support the temporary bus stops.

2173
03:14:31,110 --> 03:14:32,771
[SPEAKER_18]: The route's going to be the route regardless.

2174
03:14:32,851 --> 03:14:38,355
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't think we need to make any other amendments or altercations to it to allow for it to happen.

2175
03:14:39,996 --> 03:14:40,957
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

2176
03:14:41,337 --> 03:14:42,058
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Marks.

2177
03:14:43,159 --> 03:14:49,203
[SPEAKER_11]: So just so I understand, who ultimately has the final say on a bus route?

2178
03:14:50,868 --> 03:14:52,068
[SPEAKER_22]: Who has the final say on the bus route?

2179
03:14:52,268 --> 03:14:53,709
[SPEAKER_22]: Right.

2180
03:14:54,229 --> 03:15:05,712
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, MBTA plans and schedules has the final say, but we want to consult with local stakeholders before we make the decision on where to put bus stops and where to put routes.

2181
03:15:06,712 --> 03:15:08,973
[SPEAKER_22]: It's just due diligence on the part of the team.

2182
03:15:09,153 --> 03:15:17,795
[SPEAKER_22]: And through the GLX process, we vetted these routes with the public, and I feel that this was the most reasonable outcome.

2183
03:15:18,060 --> 03:15:21,861
[SPEAKER_11]: So is the city of Meffitt signed off on this particular route that you're showing us tonight?

2184
03:15:24,302 --> 03:15:41,308
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, in the GLX review process with those internal technical meetings and community work group meetings, and including a public meeting in July where we vetted some of these options and a series of public meetings that were held in Somerville by either the city of Somerville or GLX.

2185
03:15:42,249 --> 03:15:44,390
[SPEAKER_20]: This is what came out of that process.

2186
03:15:44,650 --> 03:15:45,270
[SPEAKER_20]: At one point,

2187
03:15:46,269 --> 03:15:50,091
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll point out again, that is the shortest route that Councilor Knight pointed out.

2188
03:15:50,492 --> 03:15:53,353
[SPEAKER_20]: But for whatever reason, you know, it wasn't agreed upon.

2189
03:15:53,373 --> 03:15:56,595
[SPEAKER_20]: 89 is going that way, but not coming back up below.

2190
03:15:57,116 --> 03:16:02,399
[SPEAKER_20]: In Medford, it was thought that the 80 does eventually end up on Boston, up Medford.

2191
03:16:02,419 --> 03:16:08,863
[SPEAKER_20]: So it was thought that some of the South Medford community folks thought that 80 served Medford folks more than the 89.

2192
03:16:10,140 --> 03:16:38,233
[SPEAKER_20]: and it might be actually beneficial to some folks, so this was, and it was gonna take a little more direct route through Harvard Street, take a left from Maine onto Harvard, but then given the issues that were on Harvard Street with some of the gas issues and the thought of extra burden or load on that street, it wasn't deemed that that was something that the city wanted, so this is the next option in the Medford side of the line that includes

2193
03:16:39,060 --> 03:16:41,642
[SPEAKER_20]: major streets, minor arterials versus local streets.

2194
03:16:41,742 --> 03:16:41,942
[SPEAKER_20]: Right.

2195
03:16:42,282 --> 03:16:49,988
[SPEAKER_11]: So, so, so you've already received approval from the city to use that as a route, this temporary route, correct?

2196
03:16:51,068 --> 03:16:56,252
[SPEAKER_11]: And you're coming before the council because it's the council's jurisdiction to create bus stops, right?

2197
03:16:56,272 --> 03:16:57,573
[SPEAKER_11]: To approve bus stops.

2198
03:16:58,613 --> 03:16:58,794
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

2199
03:16:59,774 --> 03:17:07,960
[SPEAKER_11]: So you would think that when the city was doing their due diligence, they would have notified residents in the impacted areas,

2200
03:17:08,568 --> 03:17:10,249
[SPEAKER_11]: and said, hey, this is what's going to happen.

2201
03:17:11,329 --> 03:17:14,890
[SPEAKER_11]: And I appreciate all the meetings you're saying took place in Somerville and so forth.

2202
03:17:15,430 --> 03:17:19,471
[SPEAKER_11]: That has not happened in our community, not from the phone calls I've received.

2203
03:17:20,452 --> 03:17:24,113
[SPEAKER_11]: So just so you know, the input has not happened.

2204
03:17:25,713 --> 03:17:34,216
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's very alarming to me that a route could be created like that without proper notification of the public.

2205
03:17:36,337 --> 03:17:37,697
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just want to say that.

2206
03:17:38,455 --> 03:17:41,336
[SPEAKER_11]: The second point, you know... Well, it is a detour route.

2207
03:17:41,396 --> 03:17:42,376
[SPEAKER_22]: It's in effect for a year.

2208
03:17:42,616 --> 03:17:44,157
[SPEAKER_22]: It's not a long-term change.

2209
03:17:44,817 --> 03:17:46,857
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, I... It's a temporary change.

2210
03:17:47,097 --> 03:17:56,140
[SPEAKER_22]: Right, but... And my feeling on that is that we don't really have anywhere else to put the route, and the only other option is to discontinue service.

2211
03:17:56,260 --> 03:17:57,240
[SPEAKER_22]: So you have two options.

2212
03:17:57,680 --> 03:18:03,582
[SPEAKER_22]: One, discontinue service on Route 80, which would be really negatively perceived by the community,

2213
03:18:04,735 --> 03:18:10,217
[SPEAKER_22]: or two come up with a route operating on minor arterials that would be... What community though?

2214
03:18:11,538 --> 03:18:13,298
[SPEAKER_07]: If I can, what community are you saying is it?

2215
03:18:14,079 --> 03:18:20,761
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you said it yourself that you thought that the other way through Somerville wouldn't impact less.

2216
03:18:22,162 --> 03:18:22,482
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct?

2217
03:18:23,882 --> 03:18:30,825
[SPEAKER_22]: Our thought was that Route 80 through Somerville would impact less because it would result in a lower running time for Route 80.

2218
03:18:30,885 --> 03:18:33,066
[SPEAKER_22]: This diversion adds about 10 minutes of the trip.

2219
03:18:33,503 --> 03:18:38,965
[SPEAKER_22]: It's long, and I can understand why the members of the council would feel that it is nonsensical.

2220
03:18:39,105 --> 03:18:47,068
[SPEAKER_22]: It was not the ideal solution, given the fact that there was a great deal of opposition from folks in Somerville, the aldermen in particular.

2221
03:18:48,188 --> 03:18:49,829
[SPEAKER_11]: So, Mr. President, if I could.

2222
03:18:50,009 --> 03:18:51,189
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Mark says the floor.

2223
03:18:51,209 --> 03:18:52,710
[SPEAKER_11]: So, Mr. President, clearly from day one,

2224
03:18:57,633 --> 03:19:00,095
[SPEAKER_11]: Somerville has been driving this GLX project.

2225
03:19:00,275 --> 03:19:00,996
[SPEAKER_11]: It's no secret.

2226
03:19:01,516 --> 03:19:03,738
[SPEAKER_11]: Meffitt has taken a backseat every inch of the way.

2227
03:19:04,138 --> 03:19:09,662
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think what we're seeing now is some of the results of Meffitt taking a backseat.

2228
03:19:10,403 --> 03:19:17,548
[SPEAKER_11]: We have an advisory board that's done Yeoman's work, but the city administration has been nowhere on this issue, Mr. President.

2229
03:19:17,928 --> 03:19:19,489
[SPEAKER_11]: And Somerville's driving the bus.

2230
03:19:20,370 --> 03:19:21,991
[SPEAKER_11]: Somerville is driving the bus.

2231
03:19:22,271 --> 03:19:25,834
[SPEAKER_11]: So when they say we don't want it to go down this particular street, as Councilor Knight said,

2232
03:19:26,255 --> 03:19:29,899
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll have it go through six miles of method.

2233
03:19:29,939 --> 03:19:31,560
[SPEAKER_22]: Willow Avenue is a local street.

2234
03:19:31,641 --> 03:19:33,683
[SPEAKER_22]: It's not classified as a minor arterial.

2235
03:19:34,043 --> 03:19:35,144
[SPEAKER_22]: Neither is Morrison Avenue.

2236
03:19:35,284 --> 03:19:37,026
[SPEAKER_22]: Morrison Avenue is a collectorate.

2237
03:19:37,106 --> 03:19:37,887
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's temporary.

2238
03:19:38,027 --> 03:19:39,048
[SPEAKER_11]: You just said it's temporary.

2239
03:19:39,068 --> 03:19:40,670
[SPEAKER_11]: You made it sound like it's temporary.

2240
03:19:41,290 --> 03:19:43,693
[SPEAKER_11]: We're doing it temporary because it's temporary.

2241
03:19:49,049 --> 03:19:56,514
[SPEAKER_11]: So, Mr. President, I think part of the frustration, you just happen to be bearing the message, so don't take it personal, but part of the frustration... Don't shoot the messenger.

2242
03:19:57,915 --> 03:20:07,101
[SPEAKER_11]: Part of the frustration is this council has requested to meet with the T for years, and they've blown us off for years, and they only come before us when they need something.

2243
03:20:07,601 --> 03:20:13,705
[SPEAKER_11]: We've asked the T not just for moving bus stops and so forth and signage, we asked about bus shelters.

2244
03:20:14,542 --> 03:20:19,727
[SPEAKER_11]: You can count on one hand, in a city this size with all the bus routes, how many bus shelters we have.

2245
03:20:20,828 --> 03:20:22,750
[SPEAKER_11]: So we'll have, not many is right.

2246
03:20:23,030 --> 03:20:30,337
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have routes where hundreds of residents stand when it's pouring rain, snowing, and we can't get a bus shelter.

2247
03:20:31,058 --> 03:20:36,403
[SPEAKER_11]: We can't get the T to recognize a stop in Meffitt Square, West Meffitt, Haines Square.

2248
03:20:36,890 --> 03:20:37,791
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's a shame.

2249
03:20:37,891 --> 03:20:48,076
[SPEAKER_11]: It really is a shame that we can't work in cooperation with the T, who's charging us millions of dollars off our cherry sheet every year to operate the T in our community.

2250
03:20:48,577 --> 03:20:50,678
[SPEAKER_11]: We pay for this access.

2251
03:20:51,238 --> 03:20:51,639
[SPEAKER_11]: We pay.

2252
03:20:51,659 --> 03:20:55,281
[SPEAKER_11]: It comes directly off our cherry sheet.

2253
03:20:55,481 --> 03:20:57,862
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think this is, and I'm not directing this.

2254
03:20:57,922 --> 03:20:58,603
[SPEAKER_11]: I know you're here.

2255
03:20:58,823 --> 03:20:59,463
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not directing it.

2256
03:20:59,763 --> 03:21:01,084
[SPEAKER_11]: Part of the frustration is that

2257
03:21:01,494 --> 03:21:04,876
[SPEAKER_11]: the T's unwillingness to meet with us, talk about issues.

2258
03:21:04,997 --> 03:21:12,682
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't want him here every night, but when we ask him to talk about an issue, they should really present someone and not just blow us off.

2259
03:21:12,702 --> 03:21:14,904
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that's part of the- I think that's another issue.

2260
03:21:15,644 --> 03:21:22,569
[SPEAKER_11]: It is another issue, but unfortunately, you know, you're here tonight requesting something of us.

2261
03:21:23,850 --> 03:21:26,092
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, I hear what you're saying.

2262
03:21:26,112 --> 03:21:27,272
[SPEAKER_11]: This needs to go somewhere.

2263
03:21:27,352 --> 03:21:29,454
[SPEAKER_11]: I just think the lack of notification,

2264
03:21:30,297 --> 03:21:32,018
[SPEAKER_11]: in this community is appalling.

2265
03:21:32,758 --> 03:21:43,222
[SPEAKER_11]: We get calls every day, reverse 9-1-1 calls, telling me about things that I really don't care about, to be quite honest with you, but something that impacts that there may be a new route on your street.

2266
03:21:45,023 --> 03:21:48,004
[SPEAKER_11]: Those are the type of notifications that should be going out.

2267
03:21:48,244 --> 03:21:48,965
[SPEAKER_11]: This is not to you.

2268
03:21:49,005 --> 03:21:54,367
[SPEAKER_11]: This is to the city that are laxing, and they can fall back on meetings.

2269
03:21:54,867 --> 03:22:00,829
[SPEAKER_11]: This was how, let's face it, you know, people don't attend meetings for the most part, unless you're directly impacted.

2270
03:22:01,410 --> 03:22:12,074
[SPEAKER_11]: So, uh, Mr. President, I think I'm going to join my colleagues tonight, uh, not supporting this unless the T can come back with us and say other options were explored, uh, about routes.

2271
03:22:12,574 --> 03:22:24,279
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm very disappointed that the city of Meffitt, this administration would sign off on a proposal, Mr. President, without even talking to this Meffitt city council, who has direct authority over bus stops,

2272
03:22:25,315 --> 03:22:28,256
[SPEAKER_11]: and mention and have a dialogue with this council.

2273
03:22:29,736 --> 03:22:31,157
[SPEAKER_11]: Very disappointed, Mr. President.

2274
03:22:31,717 --> 03:22:32,777
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

2275
03:22:33,317 --> 03:22:33,878
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Knight.

2276
03:22:36,438 --> 03:22:38,959
[SPEAKER_17]: Todd, you worked over in the City Assembly for a period of time, correct?

2277
03:22:38,979 --> 03:22:39,399
[SPEAKER_12]: Correct.

2278
03:22:39,979 --> 03:22:43,561
[SPEAKER_17]: Did you work on this project at all?

2279
03:22:43,621 --> 03:22:44,701
[SPEAKER_20]: Let me see.

2280
03:22:47,762 --> 03:22:51,703
[SPEAKER_20]: It may have been the planning stages way back then, possibly.

2281
03:22:52,332 --> 03:22:55,773
[SPEAKER_17]: The planning stages of the Broadway bridge closure, or the planning stages of the geode?

2282
03:22:55,793 --> 03:22:56,313
[SPEAKER_20]: No, no, no.

2283
03:22:56,553 --> 03:22:57,333
[SPEAKER_20]: I worked there.

2284
03:22:57,373 --> 03:22:59,154
[SPEAKER_20]: I ended working there in 2004.

2285
03:23:01,135 --> 03:23:07,296
[SPEAKER_20]: So this, yeah, that wasn't a detail that was even near on the table at that point.

2286
03:23:07,436 --> 03:23:09,957
[SPEAKER_17]: And Todd, can you tell us in terms of the process?

2287
03:23:09,997 --> 03:23:17,259
[SPEAKER_18]: And I know it's difficult for you to come in to this so late in the game, where the council had requested that we hire a traffic engineer.

2288
03:23:17,319 --> 03:23:20,400
[SPEAKER_18]: I think two budget cycles passed that we funded it before you got hired.

2289
03:23:21,014 --> 03:23:22,755
[SPEAKER_18]: then you got hired, and now you're here.

2290
03:23:22,875 --> 03:23:28,678
[SPEAKER_18]: So as they like to say, the train was rolling down the tracks well before you got involved in this circumstance.

2291
03:23:29,679 --> 03:23:39,784
[SPEAKER_18]: But based upon your opinion, what type of feedback have you been able to give in terms of this route, in terms of the administration's position on this alternative route?

2292
03:23:40,484 --> 03:23:43,546
[SPEAKER_18]: And I mean, obviously, they signed off on it, so it must be something that they're supporting.

2293
03:23:44,386 --> 03:23:50,069
[SPEAKER_18]: But I mean, from a traffic engineering standpoint, what challenges do you see if, in fact, this route does go through the city of Medford

2294
03:23:50,797 --> 03:23:56,261
[SPEAKER_18]: looking at these roads, these major arterials, I guess they're called, you know, Mr. President.

2295
03:23:57,362 --> 03:23:59,664
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, minor, I'm sorry, minor arterias.

2296
03:24:00,164 --> 03:24:03,607
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, but ultimately Main Street has a significant parking situation.

2297
03:24:04,667 --> 03:24:06,889
[SPEAKER_18]: One thing we have to remember about Main Street, it's an emergency artery.

2298
03:24:06,929 --> 03:24:10,332
[SPEAKER_18]: All these are emergency arteries, and our emergency arteries are swept once a week.

2299
03:24:11,092 --> 03:24:15,636
[SPEAKER_18]: So there are parking restrictions that are already in place when the street sweeping program is implemented in the good weather.

2300
03:24:16,456 --> 03:24:17,557
[SPEAKER_18]: So with that being said, you know,

2301
03:24:18,020 --> 03:24:20,582
[SPEAKER_18]: What type of feedback input have you had?

2302
03:24:20,642 --> 03:24:32,832
[SPEAKER_18]: And what type of coordination of efforts with the DPW has taken place to ensure that if this route does go through the city of Medford, which it sounds like it's going to do, that our day-to-day operations can continue in the fashion that they have in the past?

2303
03:24:34,194 --> 03:24:37,897
[SPEAKER_20]: At various meetings, including public meetings, I've heard

2304
03:24:38,577 --> 03:24:45,480
[SPEAKER_20]: I believe there was one held in this chamber in July, and then, again, as I mentioned, there was one in College Ave, there was one in St.

2305
03:24:45,520 --> 03:25:08,189
[SPEAKER_20]: Clements, and at those meetings, I have heard from the public that they don't want to lose the Route 80 service, they want to maintain 89 and 80 in this vicinity, not that anyone had mentioned losing it, but by kicking it slowly over into Somerville, they were concerned that it would be further away from them, it would be less usable to Medford residents, so that was one.

2306
03:25:08,429 --> 03:25:11,450
[SPEAKER_18]: Who was the person that was bringing or raising these concerns, these community residents?

2307
03:25:11,470 --> 03:25:19,614
[SPEAKER_18]: Were they community residents that lived in Somerville that was so wholeheartedly concerned about their neighbors over in Medford that they said, we better make sure this bus goes through Medford so that our Medford neighbors can get it?

2308
03:25:20,014 --> 03:25:21,754
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't want it to come down Cedar Street?

2309
03:25:21,894 --> 03:25:28,017
[SPEAKER_18]: Or were they people that lived in Medford and expressed the concern that said, I'm not going to be able to get access to my bus if I'm going to work?

2310
03:25:28,117 --> 03:25:30,998
[SPEAKER_20]: I truly believe they were city of Medford residents.

2311
03:25:31,078 --> 03:25:31,458
[SPEAKER_20]: They were.

2312
03:25:31,598 --> 03:25:35,260
[SPEAKER_20]: And one in particular, Jim Silver's on the community working group.

2313
03:25:35,480 --> 03:25:38,161
[SPEAKER_20]: And he's obviously very involved in this community in South Medford.

2314
03:25:38,625 --> 03:25:40,446
[SPEAKER_20]: I believe he's in support.

2315
03:25:40,486 --> 03:25:45,370
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, there are a variety of special interest organizations in the community that are interested in certain things to happen.

2316
03:25:45,390 --> 03:25:46,631
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, we get that, you know what I mean?

2317
03:25:46,651 --> 03:25:48,792
[SPEAKER_18]: But ultimately this is a quality of life issue for neighbors.

2318
03:25:49,433 --> 03:25:56,018
[SPEAKER_18]: And you know, if we're taking away three or four or five pocket spots in front of somebody's house so that we can put a bus there, that's going to temporarily temporarily service the community.

2319
03:25:56,038 --> 03:26:01,522
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to have people that for a year, we're going to get used to taking the 80 bus and they're going to for a year, lose the pocket spots in front of their house.

2320
03:26:01,942 --> 03:26:03,903
[SPEAKER_18]: Then God willing, this project gets finished.

2321
03:26:03,923 --> 03:26:04,584
[SPEAKER_18]: That bus is gone.

2322
03:26:04,940 --> 03:26:08,891
[SPEAKER_18]: Now they gotta go say, oh, geez, well, that was convenient for a year, but now let me change my whole commuting style.

2323
03:26:09,232 --> 03:26:11,117
[SPEAKER_18]: I gotta figure out how to get in the 80 over in Somerville.

2324
03:26:11,137 --> 03:26:12,761
[SPEAKER_18]: Now it's a mile and a half away down the street.

2325
03:26:13,807 --> 03:26:19,531
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, I just don't think it makes sense, the route, but you're not here for the route, you're here for the bus stops, and I oppose the bus stops.

2326
03:26:19,551 --> 03:26:41,463
[SPEAKER_22]: We did hear from residents in that corner triangle there from Goon Square, who did live in Medford, that they wanted convenient service to Lechmere, and so we thought it would be a nicety to put temporary stops, you know, at Albion Street,

2327
03:26:42,489 --> 03:26:50,734
[SPEAKER_22]: Given the fact that we also have a temporary stop at Magoon Square in front of the CVS, maybe those two stops at Albion Street aren't necessary.

2328
03:26:50,874 --> 03:27:01,380
[SPEAKER_22]: It sounds like the Council is concerned about parking impacts in an area that's parking-constrained, and rightfully so.

2329
03:27:01,700 --> 03:27:03,921
[SPEAKER_22]: And that's why we want to

2330
03:27:06,227 --> 03:27:17,553
[SPEAKER_22]: bring this by you and know very directly what the parking impacts are because I know that in Medford parking is highly coveted.

2331
03:27:17,593 --> 03:27:35,263
[SPEAKER_22]: But it was really a nicety so that folks who lived in those streets near the Somerville line who are accustomed to boarding 80 on Broadway, just east of the bridge closure, would be able to board on Main Street in Medford.

2332
03:27:36,003 --> 03:27:37,464
[SPEAKER_22]: It wasn't to cause any hardship.

2333
03:27:37,724 --> 03:27:40,186
[SPEAKER_22]: It was to simply make their lives easier.

2334
03:27:40,726 --> 03:27:50,212
[SPEAKER_22]: Seniors, in particular, who are dependent on Route 80 to get to Lechmere and ride the Green Line into town.

2335
03:27:50,972 --> 03:27:52,974
[SPEAKER_22]: So it was well intended.

2336
03:27:56,516 --> 03:27:59,698
[SPEAKER_22]: And I hope you reconsider that.

2337
03:28:05,865 --> 03:28:06,985
[SPEAKER_16]: Any further questions, Councilor Knight?

2338
03:28:07,866 --> 03:28:08,606
[SPEAKER_17]: That'll do it for me, sir.

2339
03:28:08,906 --> 03:28:09,946
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

2340
03:28:10,086 --> 03:28:11,287
[SPEAKER_16]: Vice President Lungo-Kern.

2341
03:28:11,347 --> 03:28:11,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

2342
03:28:11,707 --> 03:28:12,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry to talk again.

2343
03:28:13,627 --> 03:28:28,632
[SPEAKER_03]: Just after hearing from all my colleagues and the TE and our traffic engineer, for me, the main concern is the Main Street and Albion Street.

2344
03:28:29,392 --> 03:28:32,653
[SPEAKER_03]: If Tufts University is aware of

2345
03:28:33,293 --> 03:28:48,901
[SPEAKER_03]: If this is going to be the route, whether we put a stop or not, I think Councilor Carviello is correct that we need to notify residents that live all along that street to let them know traffic is going to be impacted.

2346
03:28:49,481 --> 03:29:01,407
[SPEAKER_03]: But with regards to the bus stops, where it's not impacting parking spots, nor bothering residential homes, I feel differently of the two proposals.

2347
03:29:02,640 --> 03:29:14,447
[SPEAKER_03]: That may be something that we could vote on tonight where the Main Street and Albion Street proposal is something that, yes, I would want community engagement.

2348
03:29:14,527 --> 03:29:21,130
[SPEAKER_03]: So I mean, I just wanted to throw that out there as almost just a way to try to possibly solve two of the four.

2349
03:29:22,451 --> 03:29:27,394
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, I mean, I agree with my colleagues, especially on the Main Street and Albion Street.

2350
03:29:28,447 --> 03:29:34,910
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to kind of figure out maybe, not necessarily a compromise, but wanted to voice my opinion again on where my concern is.

2351
03:29:35,430 --> 03:29:42,853
[SPEAKER_03]: Losing six spots on Main Street is a concern of mine, and the residents should be aware of it before we take action on it.

2352
03:29:43,593 --> 03:29:46,034
[SPEAKER_03]: On College Ave, you're not losing spots.

2353
03:29:46,334 --> 03:29:52,837
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just in front of Tufts University, so I don't have as much of a problem, and I think that's something I could move forward tonight if my colleagues felt the same.

2354
03:29:56,663 --> 03:30:00,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that a resolution that you're making?

2355
03:30:00,364 --> 03:30:02,124
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to kind of throw it out there.

2356
03:30:04,105 --> 03:30:10,346
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to just bring the conversation back because we're all pretty upset that we've requested meetings.

2357
03:30:10,886 --> 03:30:11,967
[SPEAKER_03]: That's obvious.

2358
03:30:12,307 --> 03:30:17,008
[SPEAKER_03]: We've requested meetings to discuss this and we've had lack of attention there.

2359
03:30:20,323 --> 03:30:22,044
[SPEAKER_03]: We're upset that we're kind of last to know.

2360
03:30:22,064 --> 03:30:26,467
[SPEAKER_03]: We're upset that we've been given this 30 days prior to the closure of the bridge.

2361
03:30:26,927 --> 03:30:31,490
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a, you know, we're acting, you know, I'm upset about that myself.

2362
03:30:32,030 --> 03:30:44,358
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just feel like if there's residents in Medford that use these stops and that is going to need a bus stop, we need to really take a good look at what we're going to do tonight because it's going to be affected in 30 days.

2363
03:30:45,645 --> 03:30:49,987
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel strongly about losing six spots, and the community should be involved in that.

2364
03:30:50,088 --> 03:30:54,590
[SPEAKER_03]: But with regards to College Ave and Frederick Ave, just trying to think about it reasonably.

2365
03:30:54,610 --> 03:31:08,518
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we have residents on Pearl and Stanley that use the College Ave stop, College and Boston stop, and it's no longer going to be there, they're going to need to board and exit the bus.

2366
03:31:09,787 --> 03:31:10,488
[SPEAKER_03]: on College Ave.

2367
03:31:10,768 --> 03:31:14,111
[SPEAKER_22]: And when we were out there, we didn't see any vehicles parked at the proposed locations.

2368
03:31:14,651 --> 03:31:22,336
[SPEAKER_22]: I think as you move down Main Street going towards Harvard, the parking situation becomes a bit more congested.

2369
03:31:22,437 --> 03:31:28,981
[SPEAKER_22]: But we were out there on a weekday, and we didn't see any parked cars in the street.

2370
03:31:30,654 --> 03:31:43,378
[SPEAKER_22]: So we thought this was the most minimally invasive location while serving those residents of South Medford who typically board Route 80 on Broadway east of the bridge or Magoon Square.

2371
03:31:46,179 --> 03:31:57,543
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'm not sure that the parking demand is particularly high at this location, but we'd probably have to go out at night to see what the utilization is then because nighttime parking tends to be

2372
03:31:58,297 --> 03:32:06,885
[SPEAKER_22]: It tends to be a different situation, but your point is taken.

2373
03:32:06,905 --> 03:32:12,411
[SPEAKER_20]: It truly was meant to be a benefit to the City of Manfort residents, so those two stars at Albion

2374
03:32:13,842 --> 03:32:19,746
[SPEAKER_20]: you know, it's a shorter direct walk down Albion from, say, Winchester at Albion location.

2375
03:32:19,986 --> 03:32:28,472
[SPEAKER_20]: If you currently live on Winchester near Broadway and you use those stops on the east side of Broadway Bridge, you know, now you could just shoot down Albion.

2376
03:32:28,492 --> 03:32:31,474
[SPEAKER_20]: If those two stops aren't there, you have to go to Tufts Square and Magoon Square.

2377
03:32:31,534 --> 03:32:37,719
[SPEAKER_20]: So it was really just to cut the difference between the Tufts Square and Magoon Square stop to make it a little shorter walk.

2378
03:32:38,700 --> 03:32:41,922
[SPEAKER_20]: But, you know, if the council, you know,

2379
03:32:44,514 --> 03:32:48,921
[SPEAKER_16]: If I may, what happens if this is not approved tonight?

2380
03:32:49,502 --> 03:32:51,986
[SPEAKER_16]: Does the bus just roll through Medford but just doesn't stop?

2381
03:32:54,426 --> 03:32:58,988
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, I mean, it's typically the practice of MBTA buses to stop at any revenue stop.

2382
03:32:59,208 --> 03:33:11,975
[SPEAKER_22]: So the 101 stops and 96 stops that are on Main Street and George Street would continue to, would also be served by Route 80.

2383
03:33:12,395 --> 03:33:15,857
[SPEAKER_22]: So, but those are already, those are stops that are already in existence.

2384
03:33:17,177 --> 03:33:24,041
[SPEAKER_22]: So, I mean, it's really, I don't think it's really the end of the world for the MBTA for these stops to not be approved.

2385
03:33:24,141 --> 03:33:32,226
[SPEAKER_22]: And I am really dismayed by what you're saying about Medford not being consulted by the MBTA and other processes.

2386
03:33:32,406 --> 03:33:33,766
[SPEAKER_22]: And that is concerning to me.

2387
03:33:34,087 --> 03:33:37,408
[SPEAKER_22]: And that is something I will take back to the senior management to discuss with them.

2388
03:33:37,709 --> 03:33:39,690
[SPEAKER_16]: If you could do so, we would greatly appreciate that.

2389
03:33:39,710 --> 03:33:40,450
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I understand that.

2390
03:33:40,590 --> 03:33:43,972
[SPEAKER_22]: And I know there's a lot of history there.

2391
03:33:45,264 --> 03:33:51,526
[SPEAKER_22]: and that I've not been a part of and I can understand why you might be reluctant to approve this proposal in light of those past dealings.

2392
03:33:53,427 --> 03:33:59,188
[SPEAKER_22]: So, but yeah, I mean, this is the route that really we would like Route 80 to take.

2393
03:34:01,249 --> 03:34:13,313
[SPEAKER_22]: There are other routes that maybe could be considered at this point, but considering that we already have it on the published schedule card, this information has already gone out to the public or will go out to the public in spring.

2394
03:34:15,038 --> 03:34:18,752
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, in a month from now, you know, this is really what we'd like to go with.

2395
03:34:19,293 --> 03:34:25,815
[SPEAKER_22]: If we can't get the temporary stops because of the parking impacts, then that's something we will have to live with.

2396
03:34:26,196 --> 03:34:28,636
[SPEAKER_22]: But this is the route that I think we should take.

2397
03:34:29,257 --> 03:34:30,237
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, thank you.

2398
03:34:30,517 --> 03:34:33,358
[SPEAKER_20]: Just to go back to impacts to the City of Medford residents.

2399
03:34:33,658 --> 03:34:45,783
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, the thought was if both routes got diverted down Cedar Street to Highland Ave to College Ave, that it would be a burden on Medford residents that do use the 80 that they'd have to walk

2400
03:34:46,703 --> 03:34:52,746
[SPEAKER_20]: all the way down to basically Davis Square to get the Route 80 bus or in each direction, Tufts University, Magoon Square.

2401
03:34:52,786 --> 03:35:04,751
[SPEAKER_20]: So it was really meant to be to be a benefit of the city of Medford residents to have the 80 on the Medford side of the line because it continues on towards Boston Ave, Medford anyway.

2402
03:35:04,811 --> 03:35:11,114
[SPEAKER_20]: So it was really, it wasn't meant for any ill intent, at least on my part anyway, so.

2403
03:35:12,454 --> 03:35:12,814
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2404
03:35:13,595 --> 03:35:14,155
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Knight.

2405
03:35:15,062 --> 03:35:16,443
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion to deny the petition, Mr. President.

2406
03:35:16,463 --> 03:35:17,243
[SPEAKER_16]: OK.

2407
03:35:17,283 --> 03:35:22,045
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a motion to deny that petition.

2408
03:35:22,185 --> 03:35:23,405
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Knight is made.

2409
03:35:23,725 --> 03:35:24,566
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Scarpelli.

2410
03:35:25,486 --> 03:35:29,068
[SPEAKER_07]: If I can, Mr. President, I know that I'm not happy with this.

2411
03:35:30,148 --> 03:35:36,290
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, it just keeps coming back in my head that we do have residents that don't.

2412
03:35:36,310 --> 03:35:41,453
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if it would behoove us to table this to next week.

2413
03:35:43,741 --> 03:36:07,774
[SPEAKER_07]: and have the city have the opportunity to reach out to the abutters that Councilor Carviello talked about and for the Albion Main Street people that maybe we can meet to make sure that, you know, that this is vetted out just a little bit more before we just say no.

2414
03:36:07,834 --> 03:36:12,317
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that, you know, the frustration comes in with lack of history.

2415
03:36:12,841 --> 03:36:22,745
[SPEAKER_07]: with issues with history and the effect that the administration waited for tonight to bring this forward.

2416
03:36:23,485 --> 03:36:27,567
[SPEAKER_07]: And now we have this thrust upon us.

2417
03:36:27,607 --> 03:36:33,229
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's important that maybe if my colleagues indulge me that we table this to next week.

2418
03:36:33,670 --> 03:36:41,913
[SPEAKER_07]: We call for a subcommittee on transportation and ask that the city administration reach out to those abutters directed

2419
03:36:42,572 --> 03:36:50,658
[SPEAKER_07]: making sure they all know that this is going to happen in their neighborhood, and that we bring this back to the table next week, if that's possible.

2420
03:36:51,559 --> 03:36:52,159
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor.

2421
03:36:52,179 --> 03:36:54,201
[SPEAKER_16]: Scott Pelley, Councilor Longo-Kern.

2422
03:36:54,881 --> 03:36:55,302
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree.

2423
03:36:55,322 --> 03:37:10,553
[SPEAKER_03]: I think maybe even table it for two weeks, have a reverse 9-1-1 call, and I would suggest we do it at our 7 o'clock meeting, let people, or subcommittee on transportation, but let people come up and have the opportunity to plan accordingly, come to the meeting,

2424
03:37:11,244 --> 03:37:15,127
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to hear what they have to say, too, with regards to people that live in those two areas.

2425
03:37:15,547 --> 03:37:18,610
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, Councilor Knight has a motion on the table to deny the petition.

2426
03:37:18,670 --> 03:37:19,891
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you want to reconsider?

2427
03:37:20,211 --> 03:37:22,553
[SPEAKER_16]: OK.

2428
03:37:22,593 --> 03:37:28,537
[SPEAKER_16]: So the motion to Councilor Scarapelli has made a motion to table, seconded by Councilor Caravaglio.

2429
03:37:32,160 --> 03:37:34,162
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Knight is in opposition.

2430
03:37:35,423 --> 03:37:36,023
[SPEAKER_16]: Please call the roll.

[SPEAKER_15]: President Falcone?

2446
03:37:54,807 --> 03:37:55,048
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

2447
03:37:57,109 --> 03:37:58,470
[SPEAKER_16]: Five in the affirmative, two in the negative.

2448
03:37:58,750 --> 03:37:59,591
[SPEAKER_16]: The motion is tabled.

2449
03:38:00,792 --> 03:38:01,592
[SPEAKER_16]: For two weeks.

2450
03:38:06,492 --> 03:38:10,015
[SPEAKER_20]: President Falco, can I just add that I'll take responsibility.

2451
03:38:10,055 --> 03:38:10,735
[SPEAKER_20]: My apologies.

2452
03:38:10,955 --> 03:38:15,679
[SPEAKER_20]: I could have coordinated and pushed for this meeting to be held earlier than it has been.

2453
03:38:15,799 --> 03:38:16,600
[SPEAKER_20]: So my apologies.

2454
03:38:26,467 --> 03:38:28,729
[SPEAKER_20]: We've all known Somerville Medford at least

2455
03:38:30,866 --> 03:38:35,171
[SPEAKER_20]: meetings and the employees know at the same time all these coordination meetings we go to.

2456
03:38:35,271 --> 03:38:37,633
[SPEAKER_20]: I've attended up to 50 meetings with the GLX.

2457
03:38:37,834 --> 03:38:41,858
[SPEAKER_20]: No, that's what I was going to say.

2458
03:38:42,038 --> 03:38:44,420
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, just a resolution.

2459
03:38:45,762 --> 03:38:51,347
[SPEAKER_07]: So with that, if we can make a resolution that every first night one goes out to

2460
03:38:52,469 --> 03:38:59,172
[SPEAKER_07]: the residents in the affected areas to inform them about meeting in two weeks.

2461
03:38:59,812 --> 03:39:00,913
[SPEAKER_16]: We've already tambled it.

2462
03:39:01,013 --> 03:39:01,433
[SPEAKER_07]: So, OK.

2463
03:39:01,453 --> 03:39:02,173
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what we did.

2464
03:39:02,274 --> 03:39:03,174
[SPEAKER_16]: So, thank you.

2465
03:39:03,514 --> 03:39:04,134
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Scarborough.

2466
03:39:05,115 --> 03:39:06,816
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, motion to revert back to the regular order of business.

2467
03:39:06,836 --> 03:39:08,236
[SPEAKER_16]: OK.

2468
03:39:08,797 --> 03:39:13,539
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion of Councilor Knight to revert back to the regular order of business, seconded by Councilor Cabrera.

2469
03:39:13,579 --> 03:39:14,579
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm against.

2470
03:39:14,639 --> 03:39:19,742
[SPEAKER_03]: If we could just take the residents that are in the audience, the CPA, and I believe the tree

2471
03:39:21,815 --> 03:39:26,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Resolution of Counsel and I Degrees 19-063 and 19-057.

2472
03:39:27,759 --> 03:39:28,779
[SPEAKER_03]: What would you like to take first?

2473
03:39:30,240 --> 03:39:34,983
[SPEAKER_18]: While we're in petitions, presentations, and similar papers, 19-057, CPA Annual Report.

2474
03:39:35,043 --> 03:39:38,505
[SPEAKER_18]: Annual Review and Introduction of the 2019 Application Process.

2475
03:39:51,913 --> 03:39:53,954
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much.

2476
03:40:08,502 --> 03:40:26,942
[SPEAKER_24]: the Council for allowing the CPC, the Community Preservation Commission, to come to the Council this evening to report back on the process that we undertook at the end of 2018, which was to undertake an annual review of what the

2477
03:40:28,343 --> 03:40:34,528
[SPEAKER_24]: Community Preservation Committee has done over the past year and to look forward as to what our goals are going to be next year.

2478
03:40:35,209 --> 03:40:52,963
[SPEAKER_24]: So we circulated to the Council and we have posted on the Community Preservation Committee's website our annual report and this contains an activity summary from 2018 and a summary of the funds that are anticipated to be available in the next funding round.

2479
03:40:53,324 --> 03:40:55,946
[SPEAKER_24]: This is also information that we shared with the Council

2480
03:40:56,503 --> 03:41:05,728
[SPEAKER_24]: last December when the council approved the projects for funding for last year.

2481
03:41:06,868 --> 03:41:13,392
[SPEAKER_24]: In addition, the annual report serves as an amendment or an update to the 2017 Community Preservation Plan.

2482
03:41:13,852 --> 03:41:20,015
[SPEAKER_24]: And that plan serves as our guide for how to make our recommendations for funding throughout the year.

2483
03:41:20,035 --> 03:41:21,055
[SPEAKER_24]: The 2017 plan

2484
03:41:24,558 --> 03:41:32,381
[SPEAKER_24]: is still going to be our guide, but with some additional points that we learned through public process that we undertook last year.

2485
03:41:33,521 --> 03:41:47,907
[SPEAKER_24]: So as required under state law, the committee has a responsibility to evaluate community needs, coordinate with city departments and other boards and committees, and to hold an annual hearing to gather input from the residents of the city.

2486
03:41:48,586 --> 03:42:03,237
[SPEAKER_24]: So from October through December, we carried out a public survey gathering input on what are the most important assets in Medford and what kinds of improvements people would like to see the CPA funds be spent for.

2487
03:42:04,078 --> 03:42:07,080
[SPEAKER_24]: And some highlights of the survey responses that we heard.

2488
03:42:07,564 --> 03:42:20,489
[SPEAKER_24]: is that, first of all, Medford's open space resources are highly valued for recreation, environmental benefits, and residents would like to protect and expand these resources to make them more visible and accessible.

2489
03:42:21,269 --> 03:42:25,751
[SPEAKER_24]: We heard that recreation and athletic facilities are in need of updates.

2490
03:42:25,851 --> 03:42:29,933
[SPEAKER_24]: In particular, respondents would like to see more walking and biking paths.

2491
03:42:30,558 --> 03:42:31,398
[SPEAKER_24]: throughout the city.

2492
03:42:31,478 --> 03:42:42,941
[SPEAKER_24]: This was something that was mentioned frequently in open-ended responses, more walking and biking paths, outdoor gathering places, and facilities to serve a broader range of community needs.

2493
03:42:43,401 --> 03:42:53,424
[SPEAKER_24]: The support for affordable housing remains mixed, although in the most recent survey, it was a higher support for affordable housing.

2494
03:42:53,764 --> 03:42:59,245
[SPEAKER_24]: And there's still a recognition that there needs to be more education around what affordable housing is

2495
03:43:00,968 --> 03:43:04,289
[SPEAKER_24]: what kinds of projects would be paid for, supported with CPA.

2496
03:43:04,969 --> 03:43:12,770
[SPEAKER_24]: And finally, respondents largely are supportive of historic preservation projects, in particular the Brooks Estate and other city-owned assets.

2497
03:43:13,771 --> 03:43:26,613
[SPEAKER_24]: We also held meetings in December of 2018, including one during the daytime to which we invited city staff from many different departments, and we held a public hearing at one of our regular evening meetings.

2498
03:43:27,552 --> 03:43:35,260
[SPEAKER_24]: From these events, we heard feedback that informed revisions to our application process, which I'll discuss a little bit more in a moment.

2499
03:43:35,801 --> 03:43:41,827
[SPEAKER_24]: And with respect to the program area and priorities, the annual report highlights that we acknowledge

2500
03:43:42,325 --> 03:43:50,790
[SPEAKER_24]: that the city is in the process of preparing an update to its open space and recreation plan, which will identify new priorities for the next several years.

2501
03:43:51,550 --> 03:44:07,279
[SPEAKER_24]: With respect to affordable housing, there have been several new initiatives in the past year that will contribute to the city's resources, including the inclusionary zoning that we've just passed this evening, the Metro Mayor's commitment to increasing affordable housing supply,

2502
03:44:07,915 --> 03:44:12,097
[SPEAKER_24]: and the Housing in Medford Coalition, which I spoke on behalf of earlier this evening.

2503
03:44:13,417 --> 03:44:32,246
[SPEAKER_24]: Due to the cost and complexity, the potential infrequency of affordable housing proposals, the committee may recommend with council approval to transfer available, to transfer to the housing reserve additional funds beyond the required 10%.

2504
03:44:34,123 --> 03:44:39,545
[SPEAKER_24]: depending on the availability of funds after the project recommendations have been determined.

2505
03:44:41,766 --> 03:45:01,775
[SPEAKER_24]: So what the meaning of that is, is that if the housing, if the requested funds for housing within that grant year are, fall below the, what is equivalent to the other project areas, about 30% of the program funds for that year,

2506
03:45:02,561 --> 03:45:09,164
[SPEAKER_24]: And there are funds remaining after all of the projects have been committed for historic preservation, open space, and recreation.

2507
03:45:09,784 --> 03:45:21,149
[SPEAKER_24]: We would like to have an option to transfer some of those additional funds to the housing reserve to ensure that there will be funds available for future housing projects.

2508
03:45:21,790 --> 03:45:26,752
[SPEAKER_24]: If in the future an affordable housing trust were to be established,

2509
03:45:27,192 --> 03:45:33,074
[SPEAKER_24]: those funds could be transferred to an affordable housing trust rather than held in the CPC reserve.

2510
03:45:34,494 --> 03:45:48,298
[SPEAKER_24]: With respect to historic preservation, the CPC found that some of the priority projects for which applications were received in the past year lacked readiness to align with CPA eligibility criteria.

2511
03:45:48,658 --> 03:45:54,580
[SPEAKER_24]: There's a need for further strategic planning and more detailed inventory of assets and their condition.

2512
03:45:55,083 --> 03:45:59,945
[SPEAKER_24]: to identify recreation or preservation needs that would constitute eligible projects.

2513
03:46:01,545 --> 03:46:08,288
[SPEAKER_24]: And so that's generally what we see as the modifications to our understanding of what the community needs are.

2514
03:46:08,848 --> 03:46:13,770
[SPEAKER_24]: The next important thing that's covered in this annual report is the application process.

2515
03:46:14,230 --> 03:46:19,012
[SPEAKER_24]: A couple of key changes that I'd like to highlight in the application process.

2516
03:46:19,828 --> 03:46:29,131
[SPEAKER_24]: First of all, we have looked at ways to improve coordination through the mayor's office for any projects involving city property.

2517
03:46:29,671 --> 03:46:44,455
[SPEAKER_24]: This is to ensure that there's alignment between departments that may have similar projects that they'd like to fund so that there's streamlined one funding proposal for the same project

2518
03:46:46,149 --> 03:46:51,351
[SPEAKER_24]: rather than the potential for different departments to request funds.

2519
03:46:51,812 --> 03:47:00,295
[SPEAKER_24]: And where we saw it the last year, a lot of community members who initiated projects through CPA, that was wonderful.

2520
03:47:00,355 --> 03:47:02,716
[SPEAKER_24]: We had some great projects that we were able to fund that way.

2521
03:47:03,157 --> 03:47:12,061
[SPEAKER_24]: But we'd like to ensure that those projects are going through the appropriate department and the appropriate person in the department so that everyone knows what the route is.

2522
03:47:12,501 --> 03:47:14,962
[SPEAKER_24]: So that was the intent of that change.

2523
03:47:15,536 --> 03:47:20,437
[SPEAKER_24]: And secondly, we've initiated a rolling application process for small grants.

2524
03:47:20,917 --> 03:47:29,779
[SPEAKER_24]: This year we intend to offer up to $50,000 throughout the year for projects requesting less than $5,000 of CPA funds.

2525
03:47:30,399 --> 03:47:38,361
[SPEAKER_24]: And we have a brochure that we've prepared that describes the small grants process, the small grants application process.

2526
03:47:38,801 --> 03:47:44,922
[SPEAKER_24]: This brochure is available through our office, which is located in the treasurer's office.

2527
03:47:45,775 --> 03:47:56,860
[SPEAKER_24]: And it's also, there's the brochure is located in the welcome desk on the first floor of City Hall, and it's available through the library.

2528
03:47:57,361 --> 03:48:02,603
[SPEAKER_24]: So there are ways that you can learn more about the small grants application process.

2529
03:48:03,283 --> 03:48:06,625
[SPEAKER_16]: Roberta, if I may, is there also a PDF copy on the website?

2530
03:48:06,645 --> 03:48:08,686
[SPEAKER_24]: Not yet, but we should put a PDF.

2531
03:48:09,406 --> 03:48:11,167
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, we'll put a PDF copy on the website.

2532
03:48:11,507 --> 03:48:12,988
[SPEAKER_16]: Just thinking a lot of people hit the website.

2533
03:48:13,818 --> 03:48:20,621
[SPEAKER_24]: The actual small grants application itself, there's a PDF on the website.

2534
03:48:22,801 --> 03:48:28,883
[SPEAKER_24]: And so finally, I'd like to review with you this evening some key dates.

2535
03:48:29,324 --> 03:48:35,366
[SPEAKER_24]: These are mostly but not all mentioned in the annual report.

2536
03:48:35,426 --> 03:48:41,428
[SPEAKER_24]: Page 28 begins the application, and on the first page of the application is a timeline.

2537
03:48:42,367 --> 03:48:47,708
[SPEAKER_24]: And the timeline is also available on our website, which is preservemedford.org.

2538
03:48:49,109 --> 03:48:55,010
[SPEAKER_24]: But the important dates upcoming just next week, we have two public meetings.

2539
03:48:55,590 --> 03:49:03,952
[SPEAKER_24]: The first public meeting is on Monday evening, February 25th, and that is a general CPA information night.

2540
03:49:04,172 --> 03:49:09,253
[SPEAKER_24]: Any questions that people have about CPA, what is it, what is it,

2541
03:49:09,686 --> 03:49:12,288
[SPEAKER_24]: What is the surcharge on my tax bill?

2542
03:49:12,749 --> 03:49:16,932
[SPEAKER_24]: How can I apply for an exemption?

2543
03:49:17,273 --> 03:49:29,043
[SPEAKER_24]: The assessor will actually be there to answer some of the questions about application, and we'll be there to answer questions about what are the funds able to be used for and how does it work.

2544
03:49:29,622 --> 03:49:34,946
[SPEAKER_24]: So that's occurring on Monday evening here in the council chambers at 7 p.m.

2545
03:49:35,366 --> 03:49:37,188
[SPEAKER_24]: on February 25th.

2546
03:49:37,908 --> 03:49:50,377
[SPEAKER_24]: On February 28th, there's going to be at our next regular CPC meeting, which is going to take place at the Medford Media Center at 6.30 p.m.

2547
03:49:51,098 --> 03:49:58,103
[SPEAKER_24]: We are going to invite prospective applicants to come with any questions about the application process.

2548
03:49:58,731 --> 03:50:03,699
[SPEAKER_24]: So that's on February 28th at the Medford Media Center.

2549
03:50:05,361 --> 03:50:14,415
[SPEAKER_24]: And then the further deadlines to be aware of, April 26th is when the eligibility determination forms will be due.

2550
03:50:15,418 --> 03:50:25,766
[SPEAKER_24]: And for any projects, as I mentioned, that involve city property, we'd like to see that those be coordinated through the mayor's office before those eligibility determination forms are submitted.

2551
03:50:26,226 --> 03:50:38,375
[SPEAKER_24]: So we would encourage that communication to occur by the end of March in order to make sure that the coordination is in place before the eligibility determination forms are submitted.

2552
03:50:39,115 --> 03:50:42,838
[SPEAKER_24]: And then in September, the full applications will be due.

2553
03:50:43,680 --> 03:50:53,748
[SPEAKER_24]: Then there will be a community meeting in November for the applicants to present, have a public presentation of their proposals.

2554
03:50:54,469 --> 03:51:10,062
[SPEAKER_24]: The committee is going to deliberate and make decisions about the funding proposals in December of 2019, and we're going to send our recommendations to all of you.

2555
03:51:12,245 --> 03:51:15,246
[SPEAKER_24]: for the Council's approval in January of 2020.

2556
03:51:16,527 --> 03:51:20,729
[SPEAKER_24]: And following that, we'll begin our next year's annual review process.

2557
03:51:22,090 --> 03:51:24,811
[SPEAKER_24]: So that concludes my presentation.

2558
03:51:25,431 --> 03:51:27,152
[SPEAKER_24]: I appreciate your

2559
03:51:27,682 --> 03:51:29,983
[SPEAKER_24]: indulgence of time at this late hour in the evening.

2560
03:51:30,444 --> 03:51:34,306
[SPEAKER_24]: Any questions, I'd be happy to answer your questions.

2561
03:51:35,047 --> 03:51:48,935
[SPEAKER_24]: I meant to introduce members of the committee who came here this evening, John Sear and Casey Haggerty, as well as our coordinator, Danielle Evans.

2562
03:51:49,496 --> 03:51:50,696
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you for being here.

2563
03:51:53,598 --> 03:51:53,938
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2564
03:51:53,978 --> 03:51:55,920
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much, and thank you for staying for the meeting.

2565
03:51:57,899 --> 03:51:59,080
[SPEAKER_16]: We have a few questions.

2566
03:51:59,480 --> 03:52:00,321
[SPEAKER_16]: First, Councilor Knight.

2567
03:52:00,821 --> 03:52:03,503
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, Councilor De La Russa took the words out of my mouth.

2568
03:52:03,583 --> 03:52:12,189
[SPEAKER_18]: Ultimately, this annual report is in line with the ordinance that the Community Preservation Commission Ad Hoc Subcommittee was able to author, one of which Ms.

2569
03:52:12,229 --> 03:52:12,749
[SPEAKER_18]: Cameron and Ms.

2570
03:52:12,769 --> 03:52:13,590
[SPEAKER_18]: Sierra were members of.

2571
03:52:14,710 --> 03:52:21,475
[SPEAKER_18]: We've reaped great benefits at this point in time as a community from the Community Preservation Act and the appropriations that we've made from the fund, Mr. President.

2572
03:52:21,875 --> 03:52:26,356
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm very excited to see us go through a next round of grant funding proposals.

2573
03:52:26,416 --> 03:52:36,279
[SPEAKER_18]: But I'm also very excited to learn about these changes that we've made to the application process, especially the coordination of efforts between city departments and applications for city land.

2574
03:52:36,820 --> 03:52:38,360
[SPEAKER_18]: So with that being said, thank you, Roberta.

2575
03:52:38,380 --> 03:52:42,521
[SPEAKER_18]: And thank you to the members of the CPC for their hard work and dedication.

2576
03:52:43,361 --> 03:52:47,503
[SPEAKER_18]: This started out as an idea that turned into a ballot question that turned into a reality.

2577
03:52:47,563 --> 03:52:49,943
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's really something that I've been happy to be a part of.

2578
03:52:50,003 --> 03:52:51,604
[SPEAKER_18]: And I want to thank you for the work that you put into it.

2579
03:52:52,062 --> 03:52:52,422
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2580
03:52:52,702 --> 03:52:53,082
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2581
03:52:53,883 --> 03:52:54,583
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Caviello.

2582
03:52:55,023 --> 03:52:55,723
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2583
03:52:56,444 --> 03:53:00,925
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, I want to thank you and your committee for the hours that you put in.

2584
03:53:00,945 --> 03:53:02,346
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry we're keeping you out so late tonight.

2585
03:53:03,906 --> 03:53:05,567
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we all want to go home.

2586
03:53:06,327 --> 03:53:06,927
[SPEAKER_09]: Quick question.

2587
03:53:07,568 --> 03:53:11,169
[SPEAKER_09]: How much have we given to affordable housing since we had the CPA?

2588
03:53:11,949 --> 03:53:13,110
[SPEAKER_24]: Off the top of my head.

2589
03:53:13,190 --> 03:53:18,512
[SPEAKER_09]: I know we've given some money, but I don't think some of it never actually came to fruition.

2590
03:53:19,272 --> 03:53:19,592
[SPEAKER_24]: Correct.

2591
03:53:22,170 --> 03:53:31,587
[SPEAKER_24]: The Medford Community Housing has a project that is in the planning stages right now that will create

2592
03:53:33,056 --> 03:53:39,180
[SPEAKER_24]: If all goes according to plan, three affordable units with our funding.

2593
03:53:40,901 --> 03:53:53,748
[SPEAKER_24]: And the Medford Housing Authority has a proposal that is going to make the housing more affordable and safe through a CPA grant last year.

2594
03:53:54,427 --> 03:53:58,772
[SPEAKER_24]: And that project was held up because of the national grid lockout.

2595
03:54:00,734 --> 03:54:05,319
[SPEAKER_09]: That was for something else, but for actual affordable housing.

2596
03:54:05,739 --> 03:54:06,100
[SPEAKER_24]: Right.

2597
03:54:06,140 --> 03:54:09,443
[SPEAKER_24]: So the Somerville Community Corporation

2598
03:54:10,144 --> 03:54:25,200
[SPEAKER_24]: had a proposal that we have funded, or committed funding to, to create 29 affordable units at buildings that are redeveloping, or not redeveloping, they're adaptively reusing

2599
03:54:25,835 --> 03:54:30,096
[SPEAKER_24]: existing properties that are owned by the Archdiocese.

2600
03:54:30,476 --> 03:54:31,596
[SPEAKER_09]: That did not come to fruition?

2601
03:54:31,857 --> 03:54:43,599
[SPEAKER_24]: It is our understanding that the Archdiocese has pulled back on the offer to have a long-term ground lease with the Supperville Community Corporation, and that project is on hold.

2602
03:54:43,980 --> 03:54:48,501
[SPEAKER_24]: We have not withdrawn the funding in the hopes that maybe they'll change their mind.

2603
03:54:50,481 --> 03:54:53,262
[SPEAKER_24]: So we'll hold the funding through the end of this year.

2604
03:54:53,722 --> 03:55:00,305
[SPEAKER_24]: to see if they're able to go forward with having site control again.

2605
03:55:00,425 --> 03:55:08,128
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I've heard the same thing that the Archdiocese has pulled back on, not that, but all projects, all the real estate projects they've pulled back on.

2606
03:55:08,148 --> 03:55:08,828
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2607
03:55:08,888 --> 03:55:17,792
[SPEAKER_09]: But I was hoping that we could combine all the unused funds and maybe do one substantial project for affordable housing.

2608
03:55:20,229 --> 03:55:34,922
[SPEAKER_24]: We will honor the commitment that we made through a year is a reasonable amount of time for our project to get off the ground.

2609
03:55:36,159 --> 03:55:59,933
[SPEAKER_24]: So we will honor the funding commitments that we've made, and if after a year there has not been any forward progress on a funding commitment that we've made, we will consider as a committee whether to withdraw that funding commitment and reallocate those funds back to the general funding that's available that can be committed to another project.

2610
03:56:00,133 --> 03:56:03,815
[SPEAKER_09]: And I want to reiterate on something Councilor Mark said a few weeks ago.

2611
03:56:06,155 --> 03:56:08,376
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to see the waltz shared a little more.

2612
03:56:09,116 --> 03:56:09,777
[SPEAKER_24]: You'd like to see?

2613
03:56:09,897 --> 03:56:16,519
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to see some different groups get in on the thing, rather than seeing the same names that we keep on saying.

2614
03:56:19,374 --> 03:56:26,920
[SPEAKER_24]: do as much as we can to ensure that groups throughout the city are aware of the availability of these funds.

2615
03:56:27,761 --> 03:56:37,509
[SPEAKER_24]: And so we take any suggestions that you have about making sure that there is awareness that these funds can be used and to invite

2616
03:56:39,724 --> 03:56:48,267
[SPEAKER_24]: groups, departments in the city, residents to inquire about whether projects that they see are eligible for CPA funding.

2617
03:56:48,607 --> 03:56:48,907
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2618
03:56:49,967 --> 03:56:50,348
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2619
03:56:51,048 --> 03:56:58,230
[SPEAKER_16]: Roberta and members of the CPC that are here tonight, thank you for all your hard work with regard to the CPC for the annual report.

2620
03:56:58,810 --> 03:57:03,812
[SPEAKER_16]: We greatly appreciate it and of course look forward to meeting with you in the future again.

2621
03:57:04,397 --> 03:57:08,801
[SPEAKER_16]: But the motion of council tonight to receive in place on file, seconded by Councilor Caviello.

2622
03:57:08,841 --> 03:57:09,562
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

2623
03:57:10,102 --> 03:57:10,803
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

2624
03:57:11,283 --> 03:57:12,744
[SPEAKER_16]: Report is received in place on file.

2625
03:57:12,804 --> 03:57:13,565
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much.

2626
03:57:15,026 --> 03:57:18,369
[SPEAKER_16]: While we're into suspension, 19-063 offered by Councilor Knight.

2627
03:57:19,310 --> 03:57:30,440
[SPEAKER_16]: Whereas many trees are being lost without replacement, incident to demolition of existing buildings in order to construct new buildings and lock clearing in connection

2628
03:57:30,907 --> 03:57:59,680
[SPEAKER_16]: with the construction of new buildings of previously undeveloped land, and whereas trees have been lost, severely damaged, or disfigured through other than natural causes resulting in a net loss of the tree population in the city, and whereas the city has an obligation to create policies that adequately preserve, protect, and provide for the replacement of trees, the preservation of private tree canopy, and the planting of replacement trees to enhance

2629
03:58:00,030 --> 03:58:02,952
[SPEAKER_16]: the quality of life in the environment of the city.

2630
03:58:03,573 --> 03:58:26,030
[SPEAKER_16]: Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council requests the city solicitor, in consultation with the appropriate department heads, draft an ordinance to establish a permitting process for removal of certain protected trees that includes requirements for tree relocation, replacement, or payment into a tree replacement fund as a condition of permit approval.

2631
03:58:26,650 --> 03:58:27,271
[SPEAKER_18]: Counselor Knight.

2632
03:58:27,875 --> 03:58:29,256
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

2633
03:58:29,536 --> 03:58:33,259
[SPEAKER_18]: This has been a topic that's been discussed a number of times at the council rail.

2634
03:58:33,419 --> 03:58:39,984
[SPEAKER_18]: There have been individuals that have circulated petitions to save certain trees that are located on private property.

2635
03:58:40,505 --> 03:58:41,766
[SPEAKER_18]: And what this

2636
03:58:42,697 --> 03:58:50,260
[SPEAKER_18]: resolution is as a request for the city solicitor to draft a zoning ordinance that would define what a certain protected tree would be.

2637
03:58:50,420 --> 03:58:59,283
[SPEAKER_18]: In some communities, they would define a protected tree as a tree that is 12 or 18 inches in diameter at four feet in height level.

2638
03:59:00,183 --> 03:59:05,085
[SPEAKER_18]: And in order to remove a tree on private land that meets that requirement, they'd have to go through a permitting process.

2639
03:59:05,826 --> 03:59:09,787
[SPEAKER_18]: And as a requirement of the permit, you'd have to come up with a plan to replace the tree.

2640
03:59:10,733 --> 03:59:20,500
[SPEAKER_18]: to replant the tree at a different location or to pay into a tree replacement fund to ensure that the community can continue to maintain the number of trees that it has grown accustomed to.

2641
03:59:21,160 --> 03:59:25,363
[SPEAKER_18]: We all know the benefits that trees bring in terms of environment, also curb appeal.

2642
03:59:25,964 --> 03:59:36,211
[SPEAKER_18]: So I thought that this was a step in the right direction for us to begin vetting a process, Mr. President, to protect the trees and private canopy of trees in the community of Medford.

2643
03:59:36,731 --> 03:59:39,473
[SPEAKER_18]: There are a number of communities that have done this, Brookline,

2644
03:59:40,213 --> 03:59:52,817
[SPEAKER_18]: Newton, Cambridge, for example, I've taken the liberty of forwarding copies of draft ordinances from other communities to the city solicitor in anticipation that my council colleagues would support this endeavor and asking him this question.

2645
03:59:53,457 --> 04:00:08,582
[SPEAKER_18]: So with that being said, I would ask my council colleagues to support this resolution asking that the solicitor draft us an ordinance for proper review and vetting that would govern the removal of trees on private property and establish replacement requirements thereof.

2646
04:00:09,158 --> 04:00:10,078
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

2647
04:00:12,259 --> 04:00:13,239
[SPEAKER_16]: Vice President Longo-Kern.

2648
04:00:13,899 --> 04:00:15,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, President Falco.

2649
04:00:15,620 --> 04:00:26,322
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to thank Councilor Knight for bringing this forward and mention, I think back in 2009, 2010, Roberta, Cameron, and I did work on a tree ordinance.

2650
04:00:26,382 --> 04:00:28,443
[SPEAKER_03]: We looked at a number of different cities.

2651
04:00:28,503 --> 04:00:30,803
[SPEAKER_03]: We drafted one ourselves, basically.

2652
04:00:31,444 --> 04:00:35,785
[SPEAKER_03]: At that time, we didn't have the support of, I don't believe, the administration.

2653
04:00:37,025 --> 04:00:39,067
[SPEAKER_03]: wasn't very helpful to moving it forward.

2654
04:00:39,087 --> 04:00:43,471
[SPEAKER_03]: And I didn't have all the council's support, so I couldn't get it passed.

2655
04:00:43,531 --> 04:00:50,597
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm really interested in taking another look at this, as well as any other full tree ordinance.

2656
04:00:50,637 --> 04:01:01,446
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's time we kind of backed down, because we did at the time hire Curtis Tudin's mom, Aggie, who came in excited and knowledgeable.

2657
04:01:03,043 --> 04:01:06,225
[SPEAKER_03]: willing to do what needed to be done to protect our trees.

2658
04:01:06,325 --> 04:01:11,668
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think we, at that time, felt confident and kind of fell by the wayside after I couldn't get the votes.

2659
04:01:12,148 --> 04:01:15,550
[SPEAKER_03]: So I look forward to working on this in the next several months.

2660
04:01:15,990 --> 04:01:17,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Vice President Alango-Kern.

2661
04:01:18,011 --> 04:01:18,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Consul DelaRusso?

2662
04:01:18,872 --> 04:01:31,779
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, if I could, through the chair, ask my esteemed colleague if he could help come again at me, because I had a moment of distraction as you were speaking.

2663
04:01:32,627 --> 04:01:33,627
[SPEAKER_19]: I apologize.

2664
04:01:34,288 --> 04:01:46,032
[SPEAKER_19]: Were you saying that this will treat trees on private property and that the city will govern the care and requirements for trees on people's private property?

2665
04:01:47,452 --> 04:01:48,752
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, that is correct.

2666
04:01:48,772 --> 04:01:50,133
[SPEAKER_18]: Councillor Delaro was always correct.

2667
04:01:50,153 --> 04:01:53,174
[SPEAKER_18]: And when I brought this forward, one of the things I was thinking of was

2668
04:01:54,110 --> 04:02:00,534
[SPEAKER_18]: a lot of land across the street from the gas station on Winthrop Street, for example, where there were 50 or 60 trees there that were clear-cut for development.

2669
04:02:00,574 --> 04:02:03,136
[SPEAKER_18]: And those trees are not going to be replaced back into the community.

2670
04:02:03,436 --> 04:02:04,256
[SPEAKER_18]: Those trees are gone.

2671
04:02:04,617 --> 04:02:05,837
[SPEAKER_18]: The development never happened.

2672
04:02:05,918 --> 04:02:10,901
[SPEAKER_18]: So now we have a gigantic, blown-out rock wall that looks like it's a rock-climbing wall over there.

2673
04:02:11,261 --> 04:02:13,402
[SPEAKER_18]: All the beautiful trees that were there are gone.

2674
04:02:13,442 --> 04:02:14,403
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a main thoroughfare.

2675
04:02:14,423 --> 04:02:19,246
[SPEAKER_18]: The trees were helping our environment in terms of pollution because of the amount of cars that travel down Route 68.

2676
04:02:19,286 --> 04:02:21,087
[SPEAKER_18]: So, yes, Councilor DelaRusso would govern.

2677
04:02:24,917 --> 04:02:34,222
[SPEAKER_18]: the demolition of trees on private property and it would define a certain protected tree as one having certain characteristics or criteria relative to its size.

2678
04:02:35,167 --> 04:02:37,649
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, if I could comment on that.

2679
04:02:37,829 --> 04:02:46,397
[SPEAKER_19]: Firstly, I'd like to say that I don't find the area on Withrop Street at all to be like a rock climbing area.

2680
04:02:46,477 --> 04:02:55,725
[SPEAKER_19]: I find it more to be like a prison yard and perhaps something else that I won't say in public.

2681
04:02:56,753 --> 04:03:16,732
[SPEAKER_19]: uh, firstly, secondly, uh, in all seriousness, I, uh, I'm concerned about this, Mr. President, while I, uh, maintain trees on my, uh, commercial property and, uh, expend amounts of money in their care and consult among knowledgeable people as to, uh, what's best for them.

2682
04:03:17,297 --> 04:03:27,465
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, I also feel that I would be at liberty, whenever I choose to do so, as someone who owns private property in the United States of America.

2683
04:03:28,762 --> 04:03:43,472
[SPEAKER_19]: that country we invoke when we make our Pledge of Allegiance to the republic for which that flag stands, I can do as I please with my trees, and I will not impede anyone from doing anything with their trees.

2684
04:03:44,153 --> 04:03:52,619
[SPEAKER_19]: Even if they own a majestic copper beach, I will not inflict laws upon them with

2685
04:03:54,800 --> 04:03:56,880
[SPEAKER_19]: how they should care for their trees.

2686
04:03:57,000 --> 04:04:07,622
[SPEAKER_19]: I think people should be at liberty to exercise good judgment on their own property and exercise their free will with regards to their possessions, Mr. President.

2687
04:04:08,162 --> 04:04:19,124
[SPEAKER_19]: So I understand that the Councillor's sentiments, I understand other people's sentiments, but this Councillor will not destroy people's liberty.

2688
04:04:20,265 --> 04:04:21,425
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councillor Dela Rousseau.

2689
04:04:21,525 --> 04:04:22,225
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, if I may,

2690
04:04:23,313 --> 04:04:33,035
[SPEAKER_18]: In my reading and researching of this in other communities, nothing in the proposed ordinance or the intent of this proposed ordinance would preclude somebody from doing whatever they want with a tree on their property.

2691
04:04:33,455 --> 04:04:47,958
[SPEAKER_18]: What it would do is require them to either pay into a fund to get a permit to remove the tree or to produce a plant of the tree wood that would be sufficient enough to satisfy her needs in terms of this replacement tree would, again, one tree's gone, one tree's up, it's a one for one.

2692
04:04:48,541 --> 04:04:59,124
[SPEAKER_18]: If they can't put the tree on, relocate the tree, or replant a tree on their private property, then they could pay into a tree replacement fund to the city, and the city could use that to enhance its streetscape, and it would be a funding mechanism thereof.

2693
04:04:59,484 --> 04:05:04,525
[SPEAKER_18]: But I can certainly understand Councilor De La Russo's concerns about this, because it does infringe upon the liberty of private residents.

2694
04:05:05,105 --> 04:05:10,807
[SPEAKER_18]: That's why I'd like the city solicitor to go through the process of drafting an ordinance, and we'll have the opportunity to properly vet it.

2695
04:05:11,687 --> 04:05:12,868
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

2696
04:05:13,348 --> 04:05:14,288
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor De La Russo?

2697
04:05:15,153 --> 04:05:21,959
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, and I don't want to turn this into a rebuttal at this late hour because I, more than anybody behind this rail, want to leave.

2698
04:05:22,520 --> 04:05:28,265
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, um, I want to, uh, end this, uh, with a story.

2699
04:05:29,165 --> 04:05:36,952
[SPEAKER_19]: When I was a young man, uh, we had a cottage in Lebanon, Maine on a lake and it was a beautiful place and I enjoyed it very much.

2700
04:05:37,012 --> 04:05:38,173
[SPEAKER_19]: We don't have it any longer.

2701
04:05:38,193 --> 04:05:42,497
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, my parents sold it and moved to the coast of Maine where they enjoy the ocean.

2702
04:05:43,367 --> 04:05:55,232
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe that as it may, about a mile through the woods up this hill was an old farm area, an old farm up there that was owned by this old Yankee family that was there from colonial times.

2703
04:05:55,772 --> 04:06:01,934
[SPEAKER_19]: And there were old houses that were all dilapidated and cow barns and sheep herd.

2704
04:06:02,375 --> 04:06:11,438
[SPEAKER_19]: And they had all these beautiful fields that had been farming fields and pastures that had been cleared from the forest.

2705
04:06:13,546 --> 04:06:17,909
[SPEAKER_19]: And all the stones were taken out to build the beautiful, typical New England rock walls.

2706
04:06:18,690 --> 04:06:20,491
[SPEAKER_19]: But they stopped working that farm.

2707
04:06:21,152 --> 04:06:25,215
[SPEAKER_19]: And 30 years later, I went up there, and you know what those fields are?

2708
04:06:26,616 --> 04:06:27,396
[SPEAKER_19]: Forests again.

2709
04:06:27,596 --> 04:06:28,997
[SPEAKER_19]: There are trees all coming up.

2710
04:06:29,598 --> 04:06:36,603
[SPEAKER_19]: So that family exercised its American free will to take out the trees and enjoy the fruits of the earth.

2711
04:06:37,063 --> 04:06:40,646
[SPEAKER_19]: And then when they gave up that pursuit, guess what nature did?

2712
04:06:41,406 --> 04:06:42,067
[SPEAKER_19]: It took it back.

2713
04:06:43,965 --> 04:06:45,486
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor DelaRusso.

2714
04:06:48,448 --> 04:06:49,108
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Locks.

2715
04:06:50,649 --> 04:06:51,670
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2716
04:06:51,990 --> 04:07:03,517
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, some time back, a few years ago, the city was looking, and I think it was Roberta Cameron at the time, offered a suggestion about adopt a tree.

2717
04:07:04,338 --> 04:07:09,081
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was actually having the city plant trees on private property.

2718
04:07:09,541 --> 04:07:10,862
[SPEAKER_11]: So if I was a homeowner and

2719
04:07:11,483 --> 04:07:16,344
[SPEAKER_11]: The city approached me and said, we'd love to put a tree at the corner of High and Elm Street or wherever it might be.

2720
04:07:16,744 --> 04:07:17,964
[SPEAKER_11]: Would you like to have it on your property?

2721
04:07:18,004 --> 04:07:19,385
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll pay for the tree and so forth.

2722
04:07:21,045 --> 04:07:28,406
[SPEAKER_11]: It never went anywhere, the program, but I thought it was a great suggestion in increasing our trees in our community.

2723
04:07:29,347 --> 04:07:36,108
[SPEAKER_11]: I, however, have a problem with creating a permitting process to remove a tree on private property.

2724
04:07:37,063 --> 04:07:45,945
[SPEAKER_11]: Now if it's a new development that's in an area that as Councilor Knight referred to, I wouldn't have a problem with that.

2725
04:07:47,026 --> 04:07:55,328
[SPEAKER_11]: But I do have a problem with telling a resident that there may be a list of certain protected trees that you want to remove one.

2726
04:07:55,935 --> 04:08:05,638
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're looking at either you may need to relocate the tree, and who knows how much that would cost, depending on the size of the tree and so forth.

2727
04:08:05,999 --> 04:08:07,299
[SPEAKER_11]: You may need to replace it.

2728
04:08:07,539 --> 04:08:10,520
[SPEAKER_11]: You may need to pay a permit to have it removed.

2729
04:08:12,201 --> 04:08:19,883
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's a very slippery slope, Mr. President, that we're going down when we start getting involved in people's private property.

2730
04:08:21,024 --> 04:08:24,265
[SPEAKER_11]: We're all in favor of shade trees and doing whatever we can

2731
04:08:24,645 --> 04:08:26,085
[SPEAKER_11]: in this community, Mr. President.

2732
04:08:26,526 --> 04:08:36,828
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think it's an overreach, to be quite frank with you, to start dictating to people whether or not they can cut a tree down on their own private personal property.

2733
04:08:37,508 --> 04:08:39,429
[SPEAKER_11]: So I have a real problem with that.

2734
04:08:39,769 --> 04:08:46,371
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're talking about new development and maybe just that angle, I could support the city solicitor looking into that.

2735
04:08:46,871 --> 04:08:54,353
[SPEAKER_11]: But a general broad brush, Mr. President, of saying that everyone now has to go through a permitting process

2736
04:08:54,817 --> 04:09:05,108
[SPEAKER_11]: to take down a tree or make sure it's not a particular tree or relocate a tree, I think it's a burden on residents of this community and something that I could not support, Mr. President.

2737
04:09:05,648 --> 04:09:13,216
[SPEAKER_11]: So I appreciate what the council is trying to do, but I think there may be other ways, as I believe it's called Back of the Curb.

2738
04:09:13,496 --> 04:09:16,159
[SPEAKER_11]: Roberta may be able to speak to that program.

2739
04:09:16,199 --> 04:09:17,981
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's called Back of the Curb program,

2740
04:09:18,557 --> 04:09:22,218
[SPEAKER_11]: the city would go in and encourage private homeowners to plant trees.

2741
04:09:22,658 --> 04:09:32,360
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that's an excellent concept and I would support that, um, you know, uh, in order to increase our, uh, trees and the different types of trees in our community.

2742
04:09:33,040 --> 04:09:40,041
[SPEAKER_11]: But, uh, you know, uh, you know, reaching into someone's personal property, Mr. President, I have a problem with that.

2743
04:09:40,401 --> 04:09:40,721
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

2744
04:09:41,001 --> 04:09:41,321
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

2745
04:09:41,341 --> 04:09:41,981
[SPEAKER_11]: Counselor Marks.

2746
04:09:42,462 --> 04:09:43,382
[SPEAKER_16]: Counselor Carviello.

2747
04:09:43,842 --> 04:09:44,542
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2748
04:09:44,622 --> 04:09:44,682
[SPEAKER_09]: Um,

2749
04:09:45,651 --> 04:09:55,954
[SPEAKER_09]: I think, if I'm not mistaken, I think there is a program in the city right now on new construction that if there were trees there that you took down, they have to be replaced.

2750
04:09:56,134 --> 04:10:00,676
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Mr. Student instituted that some years ago.

2751
04:10:01,156 --> 04:10:07,338
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think you may have something already in place that when you take a tree down on a new construction, you have to replace it.

2752
04:10:08,158 --> 04:10:12,260
[SPEAKER_09]: And I remember about four years ago,

2753
04:10:13,303 --> 04:10:15,385
[SPEAKER_09]: I was involved six years ago, we were involved with the chamber.

2754
04:10:16,547 --> 04:10:19,430
[SPEAKER_09]: Myself with Aggie, too, and the mayor.

2755
04:10:19,891 --> 04:10:23,655
[SPEAKER_09]: We did a buy a tree, get a tree for the business community.

2756
04:10:23,715 --> 04:10:28,300
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think we put up about 18 trees around the city.

2757
04:10:28,320 --> 04:10:30,543
[SPEAKER_09]: So it ended up working out pretty good then, too.

2758
04:10:32,665 --> 04:10:33,847
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Caviello.

2759
04:10:35,507 --> 04:10:36,708
[SPEAKER_16]: Name and address for the record, please.

2760
04:10:37,209 --> 04:10:43,916
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, I'm Curtis Toon, I live at 38 Early Ave, and I'm here tonight to speak for the Medford Energy and Environment Committee.

2761
04:10:44,377 --> 04:10:48,822
[SPEAKER_13]: So just real quick, thank you, councilors, for making trees a priority.

2762
04:10:48,842 --> 04:10:54,288
[SPEAKER_13]: Medford's tree canopy has been in decline, so protecting significant community trees is more important than ever.

2763
04:10:54,968 --> 04:11:05,756
[SPEAKER_13]: Knowing how critical trees are to public health and ecology, a subcommittee of the Medford Energy and Environment Committee has worked on a report about local tree protection and other aspects of the proposed resolution.

2764
04:11:05,776 --> 04:11:13,461
[SPEAKER_13]: It will be completed soon, so for now there's just one request that the resolution create a general tree fund and not just a tree replacement fund.

2765
04:11:14,182 --> 04:11:18,905
[SPEAKER_13]: This would address the need to grow our community tree canopy and not only replace what we have left.

2766
04:11:19,405 --> 04:11:23,128
[SPEAKER_13]: Overall, we look forward to collaborating as the process moves forward, so thank you again.

2767
04:11:23,768 --> 04:11:24,109
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2768
04:11:28,753 --> 04:11:30,894
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Knight.

2769
04:11:30,914 --> 04:11:45,245
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, in the research that I've been able to perform relative to other communities that have implemented this, some other communities have put criteria on it based upon the duration of home ownership to ensure that an individual that's applying for a permit to remove a tree isn't a developer.

2770
04:11:45,265 --> 04:11:48,167
[SPEAKER_18]: They can show that they've lived at the property for an extended period of time.

2771
04:11:48,827 --> 04:11:53,071
[SPEAKER_18]: Nothing in the ordinance, again, would preclude somebody from removing a tree that was on their private property.

2772
04:11:53,091 --> 04:11:54,892
[SPEAKER_18]: It would just establish a certain criteria.

2773
04:11:55,292 --> 04:12:01,737
[SPEAKER_18]: for us to establish a funding mechanism to replace trees in the community that are taken down on private properties.

2774
04:12:02,117 --> 04:12:06,500
[SPEAKER_18]: As everybody likes to say, there are two things that nobody wants to see be made in this world, a sausage and a law.

2775
04:12:07,161 --> 04:12:10,524
[SPEAKER_18]: That's why we asked the city solicitor to draft this and then we'll have an opportunity to vet it.

2776
04:12:10,884 --> 04:12:15,447
[SPEAKER_18]: I asked my council colleagues to allow the solicitor the opportunity to come up with a draft ordinance for us to go through.

2777
04:12:15,968 --> 04:12:19,771
[SPEAKER_18]: And if we can reach a consensus for something that works for this community, that's great.

2778
04:12:19,851 --> 04:12:20,991
[SPEAKER_18]: If not, that's okay too.

2779
04:12:21,072 --> 04:12:21,592
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what we have.

2780
04:12:23,234 --> 04:12:24,114
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Council.

2781
04:12:24,315 --> 04:12:25,335
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor DelaRusso?

2782
04:12:25,475 --> 04:12:26,996
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, I've grown tired.

2783
04:12:28,016 --> 04:12:30,898
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor DelaRusso.

2784
04:12:31,418 --> 04:12:32,038
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Marks?

2785
04:12:32,979 --> 04:12:51,128
[SPEAKER_11]: Just if I could, because once we ask as a council, the city solicit to create an ordinance based on what's being submitted to us, I have a concern with the language that's in this, because the council is saying not to preclude someone from taking down a tree,

2786
04:12:51,675 --> 04:12:56,037
[SPEAKER_11]: but it also says there's a permitting process and certain trees are protected.

2787
04:12:56,578 --> 04:13:00,139
[SPEAKER_11]: So I don't know, are there certain trees that you're never going to be able to remove?

2788
04:13:00,560 --> 04:13:03,901
[SPEAKER_11]: Are there certain trees that you're going to have to relocate?

2789
04:13:05,542 --> 04:13:09,304
[SPEAKER_11]: Everyone now is going to, if you want to remove a tree, you're going to have to pay a fee.

2790
04:13:09,584 --> 04:13:10,545
[SPEAKER_11]: Here goes another fee.

2791
04:13:10,565 --> 04:13:12,566
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, that's, we have a water fee.

2792
04:13:12,586 --> 04:13:13,746
[SPEAKER_11]: Now we've got a fee on everything.

2793
04:13:14,187 --> 04:13:18,869
[SPEAKER_11]: That's create a fee to move a tree or take down a tree on private property.

2794
04:13:19,376 --> 04:13:21,377
[SPEAKER_11]: Next they'll charge you for cutting your grass.

2795
04:13:22,137 --> 04:13:24,858
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, if you, anytime you want to cut your grass, we'll charge you a fee for that too.

2796
04:13:25,618 --> 04:13:27,218
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, you know, it really is.

2797
04:13:27,298 --> 04:13:29,719
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just another way of generating revenue.

2798
04:13:30,619 --> 04:13:36,161
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, and, uh, if the mayor wants to create a tree fund, she can do it overnight.

2799
04:13:37,181 --> 04:13:38,021
[SPEAKER_11]: She can do it overnight.

2800
04:13:38,041 --> 04:13:45,623
[SPEAKER_11]: If she wanted to create a tree fund in this city, there's plenty of revenue streams right now that they could dedicate, uh, towards a tree fund.

2801
04:13:45,923 --> 04:13:47,584
[SPEAKER_11]: If that's what the mayor's intent was to do.

2802
04:13:48,253 --> 04:13:53,715
[SPEAKER_11]: but to add a permit charge on someone that wants to remove a tree for a host of reasons.

2803
04:13:54,375 --> 04:14:04,979
[SPEAKER_11]: Most people that contact me about trees and so forth on private property, after I'm done discussing, it's usually because the tree's ill or sick, and they're taking it down for a particular purpose.

2804
04:14:06,199 --> 04:14:08,440
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're not just taking it down because they don't like trees.

2805
04:14:09,480 --> 04:14:17,583
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just, again, Mr. President, I'm not going to have the city solicitor spin his wheels on drafting something

2806
04:14:18,247 --> 04:14:29,594
[SPEAKER_11]: an ordinance that I'm just opposed to reaching out to people on private property and requesting that they pay a fee, permitting fee, to remove a tree in their own property.

2807
04:14:30,135 --> 04:14:42,562
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, we got to remember, we're looking at the snow shoveling ordinance now shifting the burden, requiring people to shovel intersections and pedestrian pathways.

2808
04:14:42,963 --> 04:14:44,504
[SPEAKER_11]: If they don't do it, guess what?

2809
04:14:44,704 --> 04:14:46,525
[SPEAKER_11]: They're going to put a lien on their property.

2810
04:14:47,501 --> 04:15:00,627
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, we're really going down a slope here, Mr. President, one which I don't appreciate, to be quite frank with you, of how we dictate to residents rather than work with residents, Mr. President.

2811
04:15:00,907 --> 04:15:06,770
[SPEAKER_11]: And if the intent is to create, you know, more trees in this community, all you have to do is look at the city.

2812
04:15:08,204 --> 04:15:12,225
[SPEAKER_11]: It was this council for years, the city abused trees in the city for years.

2813
04:15:12,645 --> 04:15:16,106
[SPEAKER_11]: They used to use them just to put postings up throughout the community.

2814
04:15:16,566 --> 04:15:22,348
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, you go down the square, there was 10 dead trees there for years in the square alone, right?

2815
04:15:22,408 --> 04:15:30,450
[SPEAKER_11]: Everyone reckoned, and how many resolutions did we put forward to replace those trees or put trees that were more suitable for thoroughfares and so forth?

2816
04:15:34,848 --> 04:15:35,808
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, Mr. President.

2817
04:15:35,928 --> 04:15:47,971
[SPEAKER_11]: I just think we've got to be very careful when we start looking at creating more permitting fees and making it difficult for someone on private property to do what they'd like on their own property, Mr. President.

2818
04:15:49,352 --> 04:15:56,053
[SPEAKER_11]: Very careful of having solicitors start creating ordinances and then present them to the council.

2819
04:15:56,753 --> 04:16:00,974
[SPEAKER_11]: And you're going to be hard-pressed, Mr. President, to do something with it, let me tell you.

2820
04:16:01,935 --> 04:16:02,775
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilman Marks.

2821
04:16:04,172 --> 04:16:09,454
[SPEAKER_18]: Ultimately, Mr. President, we're debating the merits of an ordinance or a draft ordinance that doesn't exist at this point in time.

2822
04:16:09,494 --> 04:16:19,458
[SPEAKER_18]: That's why I've asked that the council support me in asking Solicitor Rumley to draft something for us to review, at which time all of these valid and salient points can be addressed and vetted properly.

2823
04:16:19,478 --> 04:16:21,619
[SPEAKER_12]: So just to clarify.

2824
04:16:21,659 --> 04:16:22,219
[SPEAKER_11]: Counsel Marks.

2825
04:16:22,779 --> 04:16:28,961
[SPEAKER_11]: So based on what we're submitting here tonight, you're giving him a framework to draft an ordinance, correct?

2826
04:16:28,981 --> 04:16:30,102
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a framework.

2827
04:16:30,122 --> 04:16:31,022
[SPEAKER_11]: Correct.

2828
04:16:31,042 --> 04:16:33,583
[SPEAKER_11]: And your framework talks about permitting

2829
04:16:34,512 --> 04:16:39,375
[SPEAKER_11]: making people go through hurdles to cut down a tree on private property.

2830
04:16:39,855 --> 04:16:41,056
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's what he's going to draft.

2831
04:16:41,076 --> 04:16:43,197
[SPEAKER_11]: He's not going to just come up with something different than this.

2832
04:16:43,797 --> 04:16:53,223
[SPEAKER_11]: So if that's the council's intent, to charge people on personal property to cut down trees, then you would say, solicitor, please go ahead, forward, and draft something.

2833
04:16:53,843 --> 04:16:55,564
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't support that.

2834
04:16:55,644 --> 04:16:59,807
[SPEAKER_11]: So I don't feel comfortable saying, go ahead and draft this, because I don't support this concept.

2835
04:17:00,327 --> 04:17:03,469
[SPEAKER_11]: If we want to look at other concepts, I'm more than happy to.

2836
04:17:04,172 --> 04:17:06,193
[SPEAKER_11]: But this particular concept, I don't support.

2837
04:17:06,673 --> 04:17:14,396
[SPEAKER_11]: So I will not vote on it tonight to have the city solicitor move forward, because from the language I see here tonight, I don't support that, Mr. President.

2838
04:17:14,676 --> 04:17:15,577
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Counsel Knox.

2839
04:17:16,257 --> 04:17:16,737
[SPEAKER_18]: Counsel Knight?

2840
04:17:16,757 --> 04:17:23,500
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, the gentleman has debated this issue vigorously, more so than the sponsor of the resolutions put forward.

2841
04:17:23,520 --> 04:17:27,621
[SPEAKER_18]: With that being said, again, I would ask that the solicitor be given the opportunity to vet it.

2842
04:17:27,761 --> 04:17:30,322
[SPEAKER_18]: Obviously, he has the opportunity to amend the paper.

2843
04:17:32,387 --> 04:17:35,429
[SPEAKER_18]: which he has not offered an amendment on, and he has the opportunity to vote against the paper.

2844
04:17:35,770 --> 04:17:39,192
[SPEAKER_18]: I would ask that the paper be brought to a vote, and the gentleman can vote which way he sees fit.

2845
04:17:39,873 --> 04:17:40,814
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

2846
04:17:41,314 --> 04:17:42,275
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Longo, Kern.

2847
04:17:42,815 --> 04:17:44,617
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Clarks.

2848
04:17:45,277 --> 04:17:46,979
[SPEAKER_11]: This council creates ordinances.

2849
04:17:47,599 --> 04:17:59,368
[SPEAKER_11]: To just pass a resolution off to the, an open-ended resolution off to the city solicitor to have him draft something, I think we're shirking our duties, to be quite honest with you.

2850
04:17:59,689 --> 04:18:01,470
[SPEAKER_11]: If the council is that interested in it,

2851
04:18:01,803 --> 04:18:03,144
[SPEAKER_11]: Have them send it to a subcommittee.

2852
04:18:03,164 --> 04:18:04,244
[SPEAKER_11]: We have plenty of subcommittees.

2853
04:18:04,564 --> 04:18:06,105
[SPEAKER_11]: Have them look at language.

2854
04:18:06,145 --> 04:18:09,786
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, at this point in time, I will withdraw my position.

2855
04:18:09,826 --> 04:18:13,228
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, if I could finish my point.

2856
04:18:13,288 --> 04:18:14,128
[SPEAKER_18]: Please.

2857
04:18:14,168 --> 04:18:16,689
[SPEAKER_18]: We are the legislative body, Mr. President.

2858
04:18:27,257 --> 04:18:47,544
[SPEAKER_11]: So to put out a resolution asking the city solicitor to craft an ordinance that conceptually I don't agree upon, and I think it's so open-ended that I don't think anyone behind this reeling could tell me how it would work, and then to take what he drafts and work that as a framework, I don't think makes any sense at all.

2859
04:18:47,664 --> 04:18:54,507
[SPEAKER_11]: Have a subcommittee, get down, start brainstorming, put stuff down like we do with city ordinances, and then come up with something.

2860
04:18:55,273 --> 04:18:57,213
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's the only thing I'm saying, Mr. President.

2861
04:18:57,253 --> 04:19:03,635
[SPEAKER_11]: So I don't want my colleague to take exception, but that's the only thing I'm saying.

2862
04:19:03,695 --> 04:19:06,235
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, I mean, at this point, I think it's moot, because the paper's been withdrawn.

2863
04:19:06,415 --> 04:19:07,935
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll reintroduce that at a later time.

2864
04:19:07,955 --> 04:19:08,275
[SPEAKER_17]: That's fine.

2865
04:19:08,295 --> 04:19:09,736
[SPEAKER_16]: So the paper has been withdrawn.

2866
04:19:10,096 --> 04:19:11,416
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not going to come to a vote.

2867
04:19:12,196 --> 04:19:16,037
[SPEAKER_16]: And Councilor Knight will move forward in the way that you said.

2868
04:19:16,077 --> 04:19:17,697
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll reintroduce it next week with language.

2869
04:19:18,277 --> 04:19:19,257
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

2870
04:19:21,998 --> 04:19:22,578
[SPEAKER_16]: Did you want to?

2871
04:19:24,351 --> 04:19:27,953
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to bring up the same type of idea.

2872
04:19:28,013 --> 04:19:32,715
[SPEAKER_03]: How about meet in committee and discuss it and maybe look at a few other cities and towns and see what they do.

2873
04:19:32,735 --> 04:19:34,736
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like we're going to do that.

2874
04:19:35,556 --> 04:19:36,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

2875
04:19:36,477 --> 04:19:41,399
[SPEAKER_16]: Councillor Larkins.

2876
04:19:41,439 --> 04:19:44,501
[SPEAKER_11]: Whatever the committee is, we should have the tree water in there.

2877
04:19:44,921 --> 04:19:49,763
[SPEAKER_11]: We should have anyone that's interested in this issue, Mr. President.

2878
04:19:49,783 --> 04:19:52,084
[SPEAKER_11]: So it shouldn't be just the council meeting on this.

2879
04:19:52,568 --> 04:20:02,033
[SPEAKER_11]: It should be the city administration, because we're eventually going to need a buy-in from the mayor and the city administration on this, if that's what they're interested in.

2880
04:20:03,034 --> 04:20:03,954
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

2881
04:20:07,876 --> 04:20:13,359
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion of Council, I'd like to revert back to the regular order of business.

2882
04:20:15,160 --> 04:20:18,082
[SPEAKER_16]: OK.

2883
04:20:19,082 --> 04:20:20,323
[SPEAKER_16]: Vice President Lugo-Kern has

2884
04:20:21,171 --> 04:20:28,695
[SPEAKER_16]: made a motion to table 19-060 and 19-061, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

2885
04:20:29,396 --> 04:20:30,136
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

2886
04:20:30,917 --> 04:20:31,617
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

2887
04:20:32,057 --> 04:20:34,819
[SPEAKER_16]: Those resolutions are tabled.

2888
04:20:34,839 --> 04:20:42,363
[SPEAKER_16]: 19-062, offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Medford City Council request the city solicitor give an opinion on the following question.

2889
04:20:43,123 --> 04:20:47,686
[SPEAKER_16]: The city council has a longstanding practice as a safeguard to protect the neighborhood.

2890
04:20:48,687 --> 04:20:59,633
[SPEAKER_16]: In attaching the condition when granting a special permit, the permit is valid only for the business that has submitted the petition for the special permit at the address on the application.

2891
04:21:00,413 --> 04:21:05,596
[SPEAKER_16]: The condition is brought forward by way of motion from the council floor.

2892
04:21:07,497 --> 04:21:18,503
[SPEAKER_16]: Does the city council have the authority to require that this condition be automatically attached to all special permit applications requiring council action by adopting an amendment

2893
04:21:19,255 --> 04:21:20,196
[SPEAKER_16]: to the council rules.

2894
04:21:33,213 --> 04:21:38,374
[SPEAKER_18]: The special permit, when granted, would go to the business and not to the actual address.

2895
04:21:38,514 --> 04:21:42,055
[SPEAKER_18]: If we grant the permit to the address, we'd need to go forward and rescind the vote.

2896
04:21:42,095 --> 04:21:51,657
[SPEAKER_18]: But if the business changes hands, then the new business would have to come before the council and, again, reapply for that special permit, whether it be signage, extended hours, a drive-through window, or whatever it may be.

2897
04:21:52,798 --> 04:21:55,498
[SPEAKER_18]: This council and past councils have found that to be a best practice.

2898
04:21:56,258 --> 04:22:02,780
[SPEAKER_18]: So what I was wondering was, based upon the language of Chapter 48, Section 5 in the Special Permit Granting Authority,

2899
04:22:03,443 --> 04:22:05,645
[SPEAKER_18]: that's outlined in our zoning regulations, I think it's 22094.

2900
04:22:05,885 --> 04:22:14,592
[SPEAKER_18]: Can the council adopt a standing rule in the council rules that would attach this condition to every permit?

2901
04:22:14,672 --> 04:22:31,386
[SPEAKER_18]: Every permit that's requesting special permit granting authority before the council would come in here and it would be submitted under the fact or under the criteria that it's going to be with the business and not with the address so that we don't have to go through the procedural process of attaching that motion every time we adopt a rule and that's attached automatically

2902
04:22:31,767 --> 04:22:39,688
[SPEAKER_18]: When the paper comes up for council action, it's taken up under council rule 37A, which says that this condition is automatically attached to the paper.

2903
04:22:40,029 --> 04:22:43,829
[SPEAKER_18]: We wouldn't be precluded from attaching other restrictions to it.

2904
04:22:43,869 --> 04:22:47,410
[SPEAKER_18]: And we also wouldn't be precluding from waiving restriction from waiving that entirely.

2905
04:22:47,970 --> 04:22:58,352
[SPEAKER_18]: But it was something that I wanted to ask the city solicitor in an official capacity as to whether or not the council does have the authority to take this action by an amendment of its rules and require that all applications for special permits that are submitted

2906
04:22:59,083 --> 04:23:05,730
[SPEAKER_18]: to the council that are under council purview have this condition attached to it by way of rule, as opposed to by way of motion from the floor.

2907
04:23:05,750 --> 04:23:06,711
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

2908
04:23:08,172 --> 04:23:11,575
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Dela Russo.

2909
04:23:11,655 --> 04:23:12,396
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

2910
04:23:12,416 --> 04:23:12,756
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

2911
04:23:12,776 --> 04:23:13,437
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

2912
04:23:13,717 --> 04:23:14,418
[SPEAKER_16]: The motion passes.

2913
04:23:20,304 --> 04:23:20,664
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's see.

2914
04:23:21,185 --> 04:23:22,366
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion of...

2915
04:23:24,802 --> 04:23:29,205
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Scott Pele, seconded by Councilor Caviello to take papers under suspension.

2916
04:23:29,225 --> 04:23:37,672
[SPEAKER_16]: 19-065 offered by Councilor Caviello.

2917
04:23:38,172 --> 04:23:50,962
[SPEAKER_16]: Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council have the administration contact Planet Aid to empty the donation box on Mystic Ave as it is currently full and the surrounding area of the box is lidded with debris.

2918
04:23:52,843 --> 04:23:53,444
[SPEAKER_16]: Seconded by...

2919
04:23:54,998 --> 04:24:08,445
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, just again, you know, we talk about the curb repeal of the city, you drive by there and the box has been overfilled for like two weeks, not the first time, and there's all stuff all over the ground.

2920
04:24:08,465 --> 04:24:14,409
[SPEAKER_09]: So motion to have someone from the administration call Planet Aid and clean it up.

2921
04:24:15,169 --> 04:24:15,429
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

2922
04:24:15,669 --> 04:24:16,650
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Caviello.

2923
04:24:20,191 --> 04:24:33,937
[SPEAKER_11]: Also in the Fells Plaza, right across from Modell's, there's a drop-off box that's manned eight hours a day, seven days a week.

2924
04:24:35,538 --> 04:24:38,599
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's getting to be a business over there.

2925
04:24:39,560 --> 04:24:41,781
[SPEAKER_11]: And neighbors are very upset that live on the Fells Way.

2926
04:24:42,433 --> 04:24:47,256
[SPEAKER_11]: because I don't think the intent is to run a drop-off business of items there.

2927
04:24:47,656 --> 04:24:50,417
[SPEAKER_11]: And like I said, it's staffed eight hours a day.

2928
04:24:50,918 --> 04:24:55,540
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's someone there, there's a big bin, they open the door up and they get deliveries all day there.

2929
04:24:56,541 --> 04:25:03,284
[SPEAKER_11]: And then drop-offs at night, weekends, and it's becoming a real eyesore and a nuisance to the neighborhood, Mr. President.

2930
04:25:03,764 --> 04:25:08,287
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'd ask in the Fells Plaza that that be looked at by our code enforcement officer.

2931
04:25:08,907 --> 04:25:09,007
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

2932
04:25:09,027 --> 04:25:09,347
[SPEAKER_16]: Sounds good.

2933
04:25:09,468 --> 04:25:10,308
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

2934
04:25:10,884 --> 04:25:16,268
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion of Councilor Caviello, seconded by Vice President Longo Kern, as amended by Councilor Marks.

2935
04:25:16,808 --> 04:25:17,588
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

2936
04:25:18,009 --> 04:25:18,649
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

2937
04:25:18,969 --> 04:25:22,132
[SPEAKER_16]: The motion passes.

2938
04:25:22,152 --> 04:25:33,879
[SPEAKER_16]: 19-066, offered by Councilor Caviello, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council request that the Park Department remove the Adirondack chairs that are in the Riverside Plaza for the winter.

2939
04:25:34,580 --> 04:25:35,480
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Caviello.

2940
04:25:35,560 --> 04:25:36,041
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, President.

2941
04:25:36,881 --> 04:25:39,143
[SPEAKER_09]: There's probably about two or three Adirondack chairs

2942
04:25:39,937 --> 04:25:42,738
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been left in the plaza for the winter.

2943
04:25:42,778 --> 04:25:45,118
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think anyone's sitting out there in this 20 degree weather.

2944
04:25:45,559 --> 04:25:51,040
[SPEAKER_09]: If the park department could have someone go by there, pick them up, put them away before they crack and we'll have to buy new ones.

2945
04:25:51,940 --> 04:25:53,261
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Caviello.

2946
04:25:53,701 --> 04:25:54,241
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Knight.

2947
04:25:54,981 --> 04:26:08,625
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, I'm hoping Councilor Caviello can help me out in understanding how citizens here in the city of Medford that want to enjoy the Christmas lights on City Hall can look at them if we're going to take the Adirondack chairs out from the Riverside Plaza.

2948
04:26:09,106 --> 04:26:12,809
[SPEAKER_18]: Where else are they supposed to sit to look at the beautiful Christmas lights that we have on here at City Hall?

2949
04:26:19,794 --> 04:26:24,078
[SPEAKER_18]: But then no one's going to be able to see the beautiful lights we have on at City Hall still for Christmas.

2950
04:26:27,240 --> 04:26:33,485
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe, Mr. President, we could also request that the Christmas lights at City Hall be removed in the interest of energy and environment?

2951
04:26:34,180 --> 04:26:43,064
[SPEAKER_18]: So I would like to amend the paper and also request that the city administration take the appropriate steps to remove the Christmas lights in front of City Hall so that we no longer look like the Griswolds.

2952
04:26:46,986 --> 04:26:53,108
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion of Councilor Caviello, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, as amended by Councilor Knight.

2953
04:26:53,128 --> 04:26:53,929
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

2954
04:26:54,189 --> 04:26:54,949
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

2960
04:27:30,154 --> 04:27:30,735
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, sorry.

2961
04:27:33,458 --> 04:27:40,580
[SPEAKER_07]: If we can, I know that these awful buzzing, I believe it was Councillor Knight's laptop that was making the buzzing noise.

2962
04:27:40,940 --> 04:27:51,184
[SPEAKER_07]: But if we can really look into that, it was when my ADD kicked in and I started hearing the buzzing.

2963
04:27:52,280 --> 04:27:53,141
[SPEAKER_07]: took me off my game.

2964
04:27:53,201 --> 04:28:05,331
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we can really focus on trying to get that fixed, I think there've been some community members that have been head, you know, straw warts behind this effort.

2965
04:28:05,791 --> 04:28:07,793
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it's time that we really look into it.

2966
04:28:08,013 --> 04:28:08,834
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2967
04:28:09,254 --> 04:28:10,295
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Scott.

2968
04:28:10,335 --> 04:28:18,702
[SPEAKER_16]: If I may mention really quick, I had a meeting with the mayor of last week and we're going to be scheduling a committee, the whole meeting soon to go over our 2019

2969
04:28:20,205 --> 04:28:21,285
[SPEAKER_16]: legislative priorities.

2970
04:28:21,325 --> 04:28:28,208
[SPEAKER_16]: And during the meeting, I mentioned that the sound system in the chamber is a definite concern of all members that needs to be addressed.

2971
04:28:28,768 --> 04:28:31,789
[SPEAKER_16]: And, um, uh, she was definitely open to that.

2972
04:28:32,129 --> 04:28:37,350
[SPEAKER_16]: And, um, so that's something that we will discuss in an upcoming meeting, but she wanted to give you an update with regard to that.

2973
04:28:37,771 --> 04:28:38,711
[SPEAKER_16]: Counselor DelaRusso.

2974
04:28:39,371 --> 04:28:41,752
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, I just noticed that it happens after

2975
04:28:42,957 --> 04:28:45,779
[SPEAKER_19]: Non-council use happens in this chamber.

2976
04:28:46,559 --> 04:28:56,764
[SPEAKER_19]: People go back there to adjust the sound that they might not be using it for the sacred purpose that the council uses these chambers for.

2977
04:28:57,585 --> 04:29:02,547
[SPEAKER_19]: I made an effort to adjust it in there, but I'm afraid my skill set is not for that.
