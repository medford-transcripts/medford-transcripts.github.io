1
00:00:18,503 --> 00:00:19,083
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

2
00:00:38,322 --> 00:00:42,044
[SPEAKER_10]: There will be a meeting of the Planning and Permanent Committee, October 9th, 2024.

[SPEAKER_10]: in the City Council Chamber, second floor, Medford City Hall, 85 George P. Hassett Drive, Medford MA and via Zoom.

5
00:00:50,569 --> 00:00:51,630

6
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:54,232
[SPEAKER_02]: Present.

7
00:00:54,252 --> 00:00:54,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Present.

8
00:00:55,693 --> 00:00:56,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Callahan.

9
00:00:56,593 --> 00:00:56,853
[SPEAKER_10]: Present.

10
00:00:57,494 --> 00:00:58,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Lemming.

11
00:00:58,334 --> 00:00:58,674

00:00:58,954 --> 00:00:59,675
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Scarpelli.

13
00:01:00,275 --> 00:01:00,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Present.

14
00:01:01,456 --> 00:01:02,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Chair Collins, Vice President Collins.

15
00:01:03,277 --> 00:01:03,597
[SPEAKER_10]: Present.

16
00:01:03,998 --> 00:01:06,119
[SPEAKER_10]: Five present, none absent.

17
00:01:06,619 --> 00:01:07,880
[SPEAKER_10]: The meeting is called to order.

18
00:01:08,823 --> 00:01:18,292
[SPEAKER_10]: We are also joined by non-voting members of the committee, Councilor Seng and Councilor Lozaro.

19
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:27,281
[SPEAKER_10]: The action and discussion items for this committee are again paper 24-033, Zoning Ordinance Updates with the Innis Associates Team.

20
00:01:28,746 --> 00:01:36,470
[SPEAKER_10]: The meeting notice writes that we are going to discuss the green score proposal, discussion of housing definitions, and general discussion of updates to the zoning ordinance.

21
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:39,432
[SPEAKER_10]: We're actually not going to be discussing green score proposal tonight.

22
00:01:40,152 --> 00:01:41,553
[SPEAKER_10]: We've discussed that in previous meetings.

23
00:01:43,074 --> 00:01:51,178
[SPEAKER_10]: The zoning consultant is doing more work on that side of things before we bring it forward to this committee for another public discussion.

24
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:55,960
[SPEAKER_10]: So that is one of many items that is in progress, but we won't be speaking about it this evening.

25
00:01:58,191 --> 00:02:04,154
[SPEAKER_10]: For tonight, we are going to focus the conversation on two main discussion points.

26
00:02:04,514 --> 00:02:13,038
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to revisit the housing definitions that were first circulated during the week of September 11.

27
00:02:13,078 --> 00:02:20,322
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't remember if that was the date of the meeting or the date that the meeting notice went out, but we have recirculated those housing definitions.

28
00:02:20,622 --> 00:02:27,465
[SPEAKER_10]: And since we've discussed them before and counselors have had several weeks to review, formulate comments and questions,

29
00:02:27,912 --> 00:02:46,605
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm hoping that that is a piece that we can consolidate all of our remaining questions, comments, requested subtractions, additions on, and get that to a condition where it's able to report out as part of the incoming package of updates that we've been working on for the past four to six weeks.

30
00:02:48,427 --> 00:02:51,729
[SPEAKER_10]: And just to finish summarizing the agenda for tonight,

31
00:02:52,818 --> 00:02:59,042
[SPEAKER_10]: We are also going to discuss the zoning proposal for Mystic Ave.

32
00:02:59,062 --> 00:03:17,113
[SPEAKER_10]: We've gone over this in great detail in a couple meetings of this committee recently, and we're going to hear some, I think at our most recent meeting was when we reported out, sorry, at our most recent meeting, we approved some recommendations from the zoning consultant on how to move forward with zoning for Mystic Ave.

33
00:03:17,868 --> 00:03:24,815
[SPEAKER_10]: And I understand that there are some minor changes, suggestions, additions to what the council, what this committee approved.

34
00:03:25,315 --> 00:03:29,419
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're going to review and discuss those this evening.

35
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:39,089
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think we're still planning to have those back in this committee on October 23rd so that we can hopefully report them out and get them on the pipeline where they will then be reviewed by the Community Development Board.

36
00:03:40,911 --> 00:03:42,052
[SPEAKER_10]: So I am happy to

37
00:03:42,662 --> 00:03:55,927
[SPEAKER_10]: turn it over to my fellow counselors if they have any initial questions, and then to turn it over to our housing consultant to lead the discussion on the housing definitions.

38
00:03:57,327 --> 00:03:59,608
[SPEAKER_10]: Any comments or questions from counselors to lead us off today?

39
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:02,549
No?

40
00:04:02,989 --> 00:04:03,189
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

41
00:04:03,329 --> 00:04:07,411
[SPEAKER_10]: In that case, thank you so much to NS Associates for being here with us once again.

42
00:04:09,611 --> 00:04:11,793
[SPEAKER_10]: And Paola, I assume that we're going to be hearing from you.

43
00:04:12,013 --> 00:04:16,297
[SPEAKER_10]: These are, again, these are housing definitions that we have seen before and reviewed before.

44
00:04:17,538 --> 00:04:24,544
[SPEAKER_10]: So if members of the public are interested in the presentation on the housing definitions, that can be found in recordings of our previous committee meetings.

45
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:34,032
[SPEAKER_10]: Paola, if you want to give us the kind of 30,000 foot overview of what we're looking at here and why these are so important to put into our updated zoning, that would be great.

46
00:04:34,052 --> 00:04:36,074
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we'll move on to comment from councilors.

47
00:04:37,148 --> 00:04:38,269
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, hi.

48
00:04:38,329 --> 00:04:41,030
[SPEAKER_06]: Good afternoon to everyone.

49
00:04:42,051 --> 00:04:44,272
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, my name is Paula Ramos-Martinez.

50
00:04:44,532 --> 00:04:45,693
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm with Ines Associates.

51
00:04:45,713 --> 00:04:49,135
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm their senior urban planner and designer.

52
00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:57,700
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm accompanied today by Emily Ines, the director of Ines Associates, and by Jimmy Rocha, our GIS specialist.

53
00:04:59,885 --> 00:05:11,213
[SPEAKER_06]: So about the definitions, we're going to start with definitions and I'm going to pass that on to Emily and she's going to explain all the definitions and everything that needs to be known.

54
00:05:11,613 --> 00:05:11,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

55
00:05:14,673 --> 00:05:15,774
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening, Councillors.

56
00:05:15,914 --> 00:05:18,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, for the record, Emily Ennis of Ennis Associates.

57
00:05:20,038 --> 00:05:25,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Just wanted to run through and if I may share my screen, I will put it up here.

58
00:05:25,564 --> 00:05:25,964
[SPEAKER_05]: Perfect.

59
00:05:26,144 --> 00:05:28,046
[SPEAKER_05]: I can see that I have that ability.

60
00:05:29,227 --> 00:05:35,693
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the memorandum we prepared for the meeting or the week of September 11th.

61
00:05:37,132 --> 00:05:52,868
[SPEAKER_05]: We had been asked by yourselves to address a couple of additional housing situations rather than types, a couple of different ways that people commonly can live together to provide more

62
00:05:54,069 --> 00:06:07,616
[SPEAKER_05]: options for people as they age, for people as they choose to live together in different ways, and also to address some of the existing conditions, but perhaps with different types of definitions.

63
00:06:07,796 --> 00:06:18,561
[SPEAKER_05]: So our memorandum showed co-living, so the idea of people intentionally choosing to live together, and co-housing.

64
00:06:18,621 --> 00:06:21,523
[SPEAKER_05]: We had two separate definitions on that.

65
00:06:22,904 --> 00:06:34,279
[SPEAKER_05]: The idea for both of those would be that people might have an independent unit that was theirs alone, but was they were sharing common spaces.

66
00:06:34,379 --> 00:06:39,044
[SPEAKER_05]: So, sharing kitchens, sharing living spaces and other facilities.

67
00:06:40,045 --> 00:06:41,687
[SPEAKER_05]: We also had congregate living.

68
00:06:42,387 --> 00:06:49,533
[SPEAKER_05]: This is something that had been brought up, I believe, by one of the counselors, the idea of congregate housing.

69
00:06:49,913 --> 00:07:01,382
[SPEAKER_05]: We chose a couple of definitions from adjacent communities that had just some slight differences in how they presented these definitions.

70
00:07:01,442 --> 00:07:05,325
[SPEAKER_05]: And we wanted to get your thoughts on those before we pass them forward.

71
00:07:05,385 --> 00:07:07,727
[SPEAKER_05]: So Somerville had congregate housing.

72
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:11,031
[SPEAKER_05]: Cambridge was focused on elderly congregate housing.

73
00:07:11,512 --> 00:07:13,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Arlington had a group home.

74
00:07:13,755 --> 00:07:19,823
[SPEAKER_05]: You could actually have all three of these definitions if you wanted to, or you could choose one.

75
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:26,601
[SPEAKER_05]: You do already have a definition for dormitory, as does, unsurprisingly, Cambridge and Somerville.

76
00:07:27,082 --> 00:07:30,163
[SPEAKER_05]: And these are slightly different than congregate housing.

77
00:07:30,203 --> 00:07:48,033
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, we're talking about a building in which people who are not necessarily related by marriage or by genetics, but are living together in certain situations, these definitions are all

78
00:07:48,693 --> 00:07:51,275
[SPEAKER_05]: valid for those different types.

79
00:07:51,895 --> 00:07:58,279
[SPEAKER_05]: We had also talked, and I think this was with planning staff, about single room occupancy and what you had now.

80
00:07:58,339 --> 00:08:01,941
[SPEAKER_05]: You currently have a definition for lodging house.

81
00:08:02,502 --> 00:08:04,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Somerville has a rooming house.

82
00:08:04,243 --> 00:08:06,484
[SPEAKER_05]: Cambridge, like yourselves, has a lodging house.

83
00:08:07,605 --> 00:08:13,829
[SPEAKER_05]: Burbank, California, we had to go a little bit far afield for the precise definition I was looking for.

84
00:08:14,289 --> 00:08:17,071
[SPEAKER_05]: They call it a single room occupancy hotel.

85
00:08:17,651 --> 00:08:39,798
[SPEAKER_05]: These are all variations on a housing type that has people who have their individual rooms, but they are getting, it's not necessarily a group of people who have chosen to live together as in the definitions at the top of this, but people who need a certain level of affordability.

86
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:44,640
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is actually quite a traditional housing type.

87
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:49,423
[SPEAKER_05]: And then finally we had shared housing, which was multi-tenant.

88
00:08:49,443 --> 00:08:54,086
[SPEAKER_05]: A little bit different from the definitions we provided earlier.

89
00:08:54,887 --> 00:08:58,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Closer in some ways to the single room occupancy.

90
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:03,733
[SPEAKER_05]: This one from Salt Lake City was interesting because it came with standards.

91
00:09:04,954 --> 00:09:10,178
[SPEAKER_05]: As you know, as I think we've discussed before, we are not putting standards in definitions.

92
00:09:11,038 --> 00:09:12,119
[SPEAKER_05]: They go into a separate

93
00:09:12,509 --> 00:09:24,956
[SPEAKER_05]: or we'll go into separate use standard sections, but we thought it would be interesting to show you this definition from Salt Lake City contrasting with the others and the standards that went along with this definition.

94
00:09:25,476 --> 00:09:28,898
[SPEAKER_05]: So these are the ones where we're looking for guidance from you.

95
00:09:29,018 --> 00:09:36,542
[SPEAKER_05]: I think as I said before, certainly these first couple, let me just make you all dizzy as well as myself by zooming up.

96
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:39,832
[SPEAKER_05]: Co-living and co-housing are pretty close.

97
00:09:40,332 --> 00:09:42,053
[SPEAKER_05]: We probably want a decision there.

98
00:09:42,473 --> 00:09:45,455
[SPEAKER_05]: The congregate living, you could actually have all three.

99
00:09:45,615 --> 00:09:55,901
[SPEAKER_05]: One is general congregate living, one is elderly specific, one is the group home, or you could choose one and just allow it to apply to all of the situations.

100
00:09:56,973 --> 00:09:59,334
[SPEAKER_05]: You already have the definition of dormitory.

101
00:09:59,374 --> 00:10:02,035
[SPEAKER_05]: We just wanted to show you the difference with the congregate living.

102
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:12,120
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I think the single room occupancy needs guidance from you all as to a preferred definition if you want something other than your current lodging house.

103
00:10:15,201 --> 00:10:15,761
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much.

104
00:10:16,321 --> 00:10:17,462
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll recognize Councillor Callahan.

105
00:10:18,988 --> 00:10:19,769
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

106
00:10:20,349 --> 00:10:24,993
[SPEAKER_09]: So, in looking over these I had a few comments, starting with the co housing.

107
00:10:25,013 --> 00:10:29,456
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that definition is pretty good, but if you look at.

108
00:10:30,017 --> 00:10:32,719
[SPEAKER_09]: So, in Cambridge there are two different co housing.

109
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:36,461
[SPEAKER_09]: places.

110
00:10:37,102 --> 00:10:48,146
[SPEAKER_09]: One of them is more like townhouses, and the other one is more larger buildings, a little bit more like apartment buildings, I think.

111
00:10:48,986 --> 00:11:05,233
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I would want to, like, I think the definition of co-housing hopefully should not limit it to small single unit or two unit buildings, but rather be a building or set of buildings, right?

112
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:14,143
[SPEAKER_09]: just to open it up a little bit in case people want to basically build co-housing that's a little bit more like an apartment building but has a bunch of shared facilities as well.

113
00:11:17,205 --> 00:11:35,633
[SPEAKER_09]: My second one is about co-living and I think what I'm hoping to do is to make a distinction between co-living and which is tenants choosing to live with each other as something we specifically want to

114
00:11:37,271 --> 00:11:39,253
[SPEAKER_09]: allow and encourage in Medford.

115
00:11:39,813 --> 00:11:43,735
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's also something else that I think we specifically want to discourage in Medford.

116
00:11:44,755 --> 00:11:52,340
[SPEAKER_09]: And the difference is really whether the tenants select who the other tenants are, or whether the landlord selects the tenants.

117
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:58,643
[SPEAKER_09]: So for example, I did a slight update to the co-living.

118
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:12,297
[SPEAKER_09]: saying a building in which a group of residents pay rent to occupy a single unit with private bedrooms and shared living spaces, including cooking and sanitary facilities, such residents have input over the selection of the other residents living in the housing unit.

119
00:12:13,397 --> 00:12:15,879
[SPEAKER_09]: And I have a little bit of extra language in case it's necessary.

120
00:12:15,979 --> 00:12:26,924
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know whether it's necessary, but the end of that sentence could be either because they apply for the lease jointly or because when one or more tenants moves out, the residents jointly select a new tenant to add to the lease.

121
00:12:28,854 --> 00:12:37,959
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that the concept that residents have input over the selection of the other residents is important in co-living.

122
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:51,667
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the one I would want to discourage is basically the same, but saying residents of this other thing, which I don't know what the name would be, do not have input over the selection of the other residents living in the housing unit.

123
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:57,491
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm thinking

124
00:12:58,214 --> 00:13:03,301
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the first part of the language of the tenant selection.

125
00:13:03,341 --> 00:13:05,323
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's a very good distinction.

126
00:13:06,845 --> 00:13:14,595
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm thinking about the prohibition of the other because there are so many different types of

127
00:13:16,249 --> 00:13:30,581
[SPEAKER_05]: general apartments, for example, where the tenants would not have control over who, you know, if you go and lease an apartment, you don't have control or your neighbors don't have control over your lease and that.

128
00:13:31,001 --> 00:13:36,506
[SPEAKER_05]: So I want to be careful that there's not an unintentional consequence

129
00:13:37,228 --> 00:13:37,508
[SPEAKER_05]: of that.

130
00:13:38,149 --> 00:13:42,593
[SPEAKER_09]: You say a group of residents pay to rent, pay rent to occupy a single unit.

131
00:13:43,434 --> 00:13:45,275
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that.

132
00:13:45,336 --> 00:13:50,540
[SPEAKER_05]: For some reason, the sound on my laptop is not as good as it was pre vacation.

133
00:13:52,802 --> 00:13:58,347
[SPEAKER_05]: So yes, if we could correspond and get the exact language from you, that'd be really helpful.

134
00:13:58,407 --> 00:13:58,728
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

135
00:13:59,878 --> 00:14:01,900
[SPEAKER_09]: Great and I would love that that'd be amazing.

136
00:14:03,061 --> 00:14:08,407
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's most of my, my, my comments.

137
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:14,934
[SPEAKER_09]: I did notice when I was looking through the definition, the definition of like a lodger, and of a lodging house.

138
00:14:17,765 --> 00:14:28,038
[SPEAKER_09]: To me the definition of a lodger was not clear but apparently it is pretty clear because you know to the staff because they have been dealing with this code for you know this zoning for you know many years.

139
00:14:28,058 --> 00:14:32,164
[SPEAKER_09]: They understand what it means which maybe is plenty and that's all we need to do.

140
00:14:34,162 --> 00:14:38,565
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought that lodger and lodging house were related to each other, which apparently they really aren't.

141
00:14:40,186 --> 00:14:46,370
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the lodging house definition is slightly problematic.

142
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:50,193
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me just find, sorry if I can find that.

143
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:58,876
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, my other comment about congregate living is I don't know that we need them.

144
00:14:59,016 --> 00:15:11,999
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that elderly-oriented congregate living, we have a lot of senior housing definitions already in our zoning, so I'm not sure that having an elderly-oriented congregate housing would conflict with that.

145
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,561
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'll leave it there, thanks.

146
00:15:20,801 --> 00:15:21,661
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, thank you.

147
00:15:22,779 --> 00:15:22,959
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

148
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:24,840
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much, Councilor Callahan.

149
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:25,601
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Lemming?

150
00:15:27,982 --> 00:15:33,806
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a question on Medford's current definition of dormitories.

151
00:15:35,827 --> 00:15:43,312
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just trying to get an idea for myself of the practical cases where these different definitions would differ.

152
00:15:44,465 --> 00:15:56,234
[SPEAKER_03]: Our current one is building designed for or occupied as a residence for students or staff owned by or under the supervision of an institution or an educational use which is not operated as a gainful business.

153
00:15:58,168 --> 00:16:17,960
[SPEAKER_03]: With the wording for that, could that be understood as, could you like have an apartment complex or a house which is owned by an institution of some sort, even like a private equity firm, but ends up housing mostly students?

154
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,782
[SPEAKER_03]: Would that be reclassified as dormitory under our current ordinances?

155
00:16:27,383 --> 00:16:29,866
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking at the definition, thinking that through.

156
00:16:31,367 --> 00:16:41,956
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the owned by or under the supervision of an institution for an educational use.

157
00:16:41,996 --> 00:16:52,285
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to say that I'm looking at that comma after institution and thinking that I might want to replace that comma because it makes it a little bit unclear.

158
00:16:55,289 --> 00:17:01,225
[SPEAKER_05]: But a for-profit company is not normally considered an institution.

159
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:04,630
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that would prohibit.

160
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,331
[SPEAKER_05]: I know what you're asking.

161
00:17:06,411 --> 00:17:13,195
[SPEAKER_05]: There are certainly for-profit companies out there that do have private dormitories.

162
00:17:15,296 --> 00:17:23,021
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the question is whether this would allow or prohibit that is a good one.

163
00:17:23,061 --> 00:17:24,382
[SPEAKER_05]: We could look into that further.

164
00:17:24,802 --> 00:17:26,603
[SPEAKER_05]: I think right now that it would not

165
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:30,710
[SPEAKER_05]: cover a for profit, I don't know.

166
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:33,652
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe this is for planning staff to answer.

167
00:17:34,172 --> 00:17:40,835
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have ever been if you the city of Medford have ever been approached by a for profit dormitory operator.

168
00:17:40,855 --> 00:17:48,399
[SPEAKER_07]: And so like, I assume you're talking about not the university.

169
00:17:48,739 --> 00:17:49,440
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

170
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:49,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

171
00:17:52,247 --> 00:18:09,009
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to say no, I would say that there has been some conversation where there are there are companies who build dorms or apartments designed for graduate students have expressed some interest in doing something that would be

172
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:12,222
[SPEAKER_07]: catering to the student population.

173
00:18:14,304 --> 00:18:22,611
[SPEAKER_07]: And when it's apartments, in my mind, it could go either way, like maybe that's their target population, but it's an apartment's an apartment.

174
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:25,653
[SPEAKER_07]: If it's a dormitory style,

175
00:18:26,954 --> 00:18:29,336
[SPEAKER_07]: That's sort of a different interesting thing.

176
00:18:29,657 --> 00:18:38,364
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've one of the things that I wanted to focus to just think about, we need definitions, so that we can say what is allowed and not allowed.

177
00:18:39,165 --> 00:18:43,568
[SPEAKER_07]: And if there are things where we're like, well, we don't really care.

178
00:18:44,889 --> 00:18:46,430
[SPEAKER_07]: then we don't need the definition.

179
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:55,313
[SPEAKER_07]: In my mind, if a dormitory is owned by Tufts University, it doesn't necessarily need to be in our zoning.

180
00:18:55,353 --> 00:19:07,758
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't matter if it's in our zoning because there's the Dover Amendment, and they can put that, you know, theoretically they would work with us, but it doesn't matter if we say dormitories are not allowed in this location.

181
00:19:09,044 --> 00:19:12,026
[SPEAKER_07]: My understanding under Dover is that they could put it there anyhow.

182
00:19:12,546 --> 00:19:22,110
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we're thinking about where are we allowing and not allowing dormitories, it would be private for-profit entities not affiliated with the university.

183
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:30,374
[SPEAKER_07]: And how is that different from, if it's different from an apartment building, and how does one think about that?

184
00:19:31,715 --> 00:19:36,697
[SPEAKER_07]: There are for-profit entities running dormitories in the city of Boston, if I'm not mistaken.

185
00:19:38,478 --> 00:19:47,756
[SPEAKER_03]: I think my other concern with this definition is specified building designed by or occupied as a residence for students or staff so it's that

186
00:19:48,891 --> 00:19:49,891
[SPEAKER_03]: It's that or right there.

187
00:19:49,971 --> 00:19:58,554
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I'm thinking is that one year it could be occupied by all renters who are working in Boston.

188
00:19:58,574 --> 00:20:08,517
[SPEAKER_03]: They all move out and then a bunch of students move in there and suddenly it's reclassified as a dormitory automatically just because it might not have been designed for that purpose, but now they're occupied.

189
00:20:10,538 --> 00:20:13,680
[SPEAKER_03]: It's now occupied by them that you see what I'm saying there.

190
00:20:14,521 --> 00:20:26,829
[SPEAKER_05]: I see what you're saying and I have seen that in other communities where say it was a large house, and it has been converted into a dormitory.

191
00:20:28,109 --> 00:20:34,991
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been bought by the university or the college and then converted into a dormitory for students.

192
00:20:35,011 --> 00:20:46,313
[SPEAKER_05]: So it wasn't designed for a residence for students or staff, but it is now occupied as a residence for students or staff.

193
00:20:47,373 --> 00:20:53,995
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's typically been after it's been purchased by the educational institution.

194
00:20:55,593 --> 00:20:58,174
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that sound like what you're thinking of?

195
00:21:00,414 --> 00:21:12,238
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm just trying to understand how... I'm just trying to go over the implications of the current definition, just add food for thought for changing it in the future.

196
00:21:12,918 --> 00:21:23,321
[SPEAKER_10]: If I may, and to follow up on the point that Director Hunt was making about sort of what's important for this discussion on definitions in terms of

197
00:21:24,298 --> 00:21:26,881
[SPEAKER_10]: why we're updating the definitions before we update more of our zoning.

198
00:21:27,742 --> 00:21:37,091
[SPEAKER_10]: And thinking about essentially like what are the semantic tools that we're giving ourselves with which to say we want this here, we don't want this here, we'd prefer this not here.

199
00:21:37,111 --> 00:21:41,476
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the point about the current Bedford dormitory definition is well taken.

200
00:21:41,496 --> 00:21:44,199
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I would be amenable to perhaps

201
00:21:45,373 --> 00:22:03,989
[SPEAKER_10]: If we want to make sure that we have a higher degree of control over where dormitories are being proposed and built, I think that we could strike the, we could have a just say building designed for residents, for students or staff if we want to have more control over where residences explicitly for student populations are within our city.

202
00:22:05,551 --> 00:22:06,492
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think that this is

203
00:22:07,261 --> 00:22:15,145
[SPEAKER_10]: I think there's some definitions that we're going to consider right now and over the next few months that are like critical so that we can do other things on our kind of slate of zoning goals.

204
00:22:16,346 --> 00:22:22,029
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know that this is one of them, but I think that that kind of change is in line with essentially what we're hoping to do with the definition.

205
00:22:25,431 --> 00:22:26,291
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would just offer that.

206
00:22:26,331 --> 00:22:30,714
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't make motions as the chair, but that makes sense to me unless somebody points out what I'm missing.

207
00:22:34,656 --> 00:22:36,157
[SPEAKER_10]: And then it sounded to me like there were some

208
00:22:36,778 --> 00:22:43,283
[SPEAKER_10]: some good ideas for updating the proposed definitions for co-living and co-housing.

209
00:22:43,603 --> 00:22:50,708
[SPEAKER_07]: Madam Chair, for the dormitories, actually as we're reading them, I feel like the Cambridge definition is the most clear.

210
00:22:51,784 --> 00:22:53,244
[SPEAKER_07]: about what it is.

211
00:22:53,944 --> 00:23:06,867
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't matter how it was designed or whatever, but that it's controlled by the educational institution and it's occupied as a place of temporary residence whose permanent residence is elsewhere.

212
00:23:07,327 --> 00:23:10,608
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I think actually that's the whole intention of a dormitory.

213
00:23:14,348 --> 00:23:18,109
[SPEAKER_07]: And that would actually rule out the private company

214
00:23:19,988 --> 00:23:24,096
[SPEAKER_07]: dormitory and I'm wondering if we want to do that at this time?

215
00:23:28,022 --> 00:23:46,008
[SPEAKER_07]: And I do think, and I would say, as I'm saying that, in my mind, if a company was coming and saying, what we're gonna build is an apartment building, and we're gonna market it to students, and we're designing it with students in mind, but it's an apartment building, how is that any different from any other apartment building?

216
00:23:46,368 --> 00:23:53,311
[SPEAKER_07]: We would like to see more places for students to live because the students are here, and we'd rather they weren't in our large,

217
00:23:54,164 --> 00:23:57,705
[SPEAKER_07]: two single and two family homes, that those should be for families.

218
00:23:59,606 --> 00:24:02,947
[SPEAKER_07]: But I wouldn't necessarily classify that as a dormitory.

219
00:24:02,967 --> 00:24:08,409
[SPEAKER_07]: And would we want to zone that any differently from any other multifamily building?

220
00:24:11,771 --> 00:24:12,971
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I find that persuasive.

221
00:24:13,071 --> 00:24:16,732
[SPEAKER_10]: And reading over the Cambridge definition, I do think that that kind of captures the intent.

222
00:24:18,273 --> 00:24:20,674
[SPEAKER_10]: Personally, I would be amenable to adopting the Cambridge definition.

223
00:24:21,641 --> 00:24:25,563
[SPEAKER_10]: replace our current one along with the other updates.

224
00:24:27,044 --> 00:24:32,848
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I could make that as a motion, but I would like to bring up with the Cambridge definition.

225
00:24:34,849 --> 00:24:42,714
[SPEAKER_03]: Director Hunt, what do you think of the idea of striking the phrase for persons whose permanent residence is elsewhere?

226
00:24:42,734 --> 00:24:46,136
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a place of temporary residence.

227
00:24:47,301 --> 00:24:52,746
[SPEAKER_07]: So you would say by an educational and occupied primarily as a place of temporary residence.

228
00:24:55,579 --> 00:25:09,552
[SPEAKER_07]: For like for purse for persons who are employed or enrolled at the educational institution right which because, for example, and honestly I'm extremely familiar with the MIT dormitory situation.

229
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:18,560
[SPEAKER_07]: They have faculty that live in they do not have another permanent residence somewhere else like they'll live there for eight or 10 years as their permanent location.

230
00:25:18,933 --> 00:25:34,780
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you're a graduate student, you may have relocated there and you may not have another temporary or another permanent residence somewhere else, and that's fine, but you're also sort of temporarily here for the duration of your education.

231
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:42,083
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, I actually like that, the striking, the phrase, whose permanent residence is elsewhere.

232
00:25:42,103 --> 00:25:44,644
[SPEAKER_04]: I would agree with that.

233
00:25:48,241 --> 00:26:00,512
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess I'll motion to adopt the Cambridge definition of a dormitory striking the words for persons whose permanent residence is elsewhere.

234
00:26:00,532 --> 00:26:00,592
[SPEAKER_03]: And.

235
00:26:02,133 --> 00:26:02,313
[SPEAKER_03]: And.

236
00:26:06,217 --> 00:26:08,839
[SPEAKER_03]: So striking whose permanent residence is elsewhere and.

237
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:12,482
[SPEAKER_09]: That's your calling?

238
00:26:13,161 --> 00:26:18,364
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think we need a motion at this point because NS and associates is going to take this feedback and bring it back to us.

239
00:26:18,404 --> 00:26:19,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that accurate?

240
00:26:20,346 --> 00:26:29,851
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that, um, I think it's fine to either motion things individually or to have the motion at the end of this meeting be to incorporate the feedback promulgated in the meeting and keep the paper in committee.

241
00:26:29,992 --> 00:26:37,256
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think we, if it's, it's, if it's helpful to have the clerk compile them line by line, um, just means that I don't have to take notes.

242
00:26:37,296 --> 00:26:38,517
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think either way is okay.

243
00:26:39,678 --> 00:26:41,859
[SPEAKER_10]: Or it doesn't mean I have to take as scrupulous notes.

244
00:26:44,492 --> 00:26:45,432
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to read it back.

245
00:26:45,692 --> 00:26:52,594
[SPEAKER_02]: I have Councilor Lemming moving to adopt the Cambridge definition of a dormitory, striking the words persons whose permanent residence is elsewhere.

246
00:26:52,974 --> 00:26:55,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Just whose permanent residence is elsewhere and.

247
00:26:57,875 --> 00:26:58,055
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

248
00:27:00,096 --> 00:27:04,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Striking the word, so leaving the word persons out of that stricken language.

249
00:27:04,857 --> 00:27:05,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

250
00:27:05,977 --> 00:27:08,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Striking the words whose permanent residence is elsewhere.

251
00:27:08,878 --> 00:27:09,058
[SPEAKER_02]: And.

252
00:27:09,338 --> 00:27:09,538
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

253
00:27:09,938 --> 00:27:10,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

254
00:27:15,089 --> 00:27:15,169
[SPEAKER_10]: it.

255
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:16,350
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

256
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:18,051
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a second?

257
00:27:19,952 --> 00:27:20,813
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a second on the motion?

258
00:27:21,914 --> 00:27:23,655
[SPEAKER_10]: Great, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

259
00:27:26,977 --> 00:27:37,084
[SPEAKER_10]: If there are not any other glaring questions or comments on the housing definitions, or are there any other glaring comments or questions on the definitions, Councilor Callahan?

260
00:27:38,645 --> 00:27:39,966
[SPEAKER_09]: My only question is

261
00:27:42,751 --> 00:27:55,524
[SPEAKER_09]: I sent an email with the language that I had suggested, which doesn't have to be exact, but is there anything else that we should do with this language or will Innocence Associates come back to us with these updates?

262
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:57,866
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Halihan.

263
00:27:58,667 --> 00:28:07,155
[SPEAKER_10]: It's my understanding that once we incorporate the feedback that we just talked about on co-living, co-housing and the dormitories definition,

264
00:28:07,691 --> 00:28:09,272
[SPEAKER_10]: The rest of these I think are in pretty good shape.

265
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:14,334
[SPEAKER_10]: We've discussed this before, so I think the next time we see this, it'll be in the condition that we could take a vote to report it out of committee.

266
00:28:15,914 --> 00:28:18,435
[SPEAKER_10]: Emily Pella, I see nodding heads on Zoom, excellent.

267
00:28:18,996 --> 00:28:19,856
[SPEAKER_05]: That is correct, yes.

268
00:28:20,516 --> 00:28:28,860
[SPEAKER_10]: And we will have, we will follow up with the exact language of the updates to co-living, co-housing and dormitories.

269
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,521
[SPEAKER_10]: Great, thank you all.

270
00:28:32,021 --> 00:28:37,263
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's move on to our discussion of the zoning proposal for Mystic Ave.

271
00:28:38,212 --> 00:28:48,977
[SPEAKER_10]: And just to recap, at our last committee meeting where we discussed the Mystic Ab Zoning Proposal, we looked at a lot of excellent visuals created by NS Associates.

272
00:28:50,138 --> 00:29:02,844
[SPEAKER_10]: Counselors were shown kind of two versions of a zoning proposal that were based on the many meetings we've had to discuss Mystic Ab and also incorporated the many documents that kind of encapsulate

273
00:29:03,217 --> 00:29:05,438
[SPEAKER_10]: we did receive some City constituent counselor feedback.

274
00:29:06,639 --> 00:29:08,300
[SPEAKER_10]: On what we want to see from Mr Gaff.

275
00:29:08,761 --> 00:29:20,248
[SPEAKER_10]: Um that kind of had a mildly different interplay between these two versions expressing different ways that mixed use zones and commercial areas could fit together.

276
00:29:21,309 --> 00:29:21,469
[SPEAKER_10]: Um.

277
00:29:22,329 --> 00:29:23,230
[SPEAKER_10]: We reported out.

278
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:23,850
[SPEAKER_10]: We're sorry.

279
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:24,851
[SPEAKER_10]: I keep saying reported out.

280
00:29:24,931 --> 00:29:27,353
[SPEAKER_10]: We approved one of them to go

281
00:29:33,226 --> 00:29:37,568
[SPEAKER_10]: in conversation since that meeting, which I think was in the last week of September.

282
00:29:37,608 --> 00:29:41,791
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it was the September 25th meeting, but I should fact check that.

283
00:29:43,491 --> 00:30:01,341
[SPEAKER_10]: Between then and now, I think that city staff and its associates have discussed that draft map, and there are some minor changes to the plan that the committee approved that they wanted to brief the committee on before it comes back on the 23rd in a position that we can take a vote to report it out.

284
00:30:02,034 --> 00:30:11,122
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm happy to turn it over to Director Cohn if you want to start out or just kick it over to Emily and Paola to give us that update on what's changed since we saw it last.

285
00:30:12,764 --> 00:30:13,685
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

286
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:26,577
[SPEAKER_07]: So what we've talked about was the need for having some area with industrial, some commercial, allowing some auto-oriented uses.

287
00:30:28,042 --> 00:30:32,466
[SPEAKER_07]: and then also having some buffer closer to the neighborhood.

288
00:30:33,006 --> 00:30:39,172
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I do believe, I think Paula, although I'm not messaging with her, has the map that she can share.

289
00:30:39,312 --> 00:30:40,373
[SPEAKER_07]: If not, I can put it up.

290
00:30:41,574 --> 00:30:43,215
[SPEAKER_07]: And what we were talking, though, is that

291
00:30:44,256 --> 00:30:50,339
[SPEAKER_07]: We had that at one end of Mystic Ave, but only on the side closer to the residences.

292
00:30:50,959 --> 00:30:57,702
[SPEAKER_07]: And the staff realized that we have actually just recently approved a new auto dealership.

293
00:30:58,643 --> 00:31:04,506
[SPEAKER_07]: And there is a very large, another very solid, well-maintained auto dealership down at that end.

294
00:31:05,566 --> 00:31:07,067
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's now on the screen.

295
00:31:07,107 --> 00:31:10,168
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you look at the end, that is basically surrounded by 93

296
00:31:12,209 --> 00:31:20,098
[SPEAKER_07]: and the off ramp to 93, that has just been approved as the Herb Chambers Toyota auto dealership.

297
00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:21,439
[SPEAKER_07]: And that

298
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:27,374
[SPEAKER_07]: location, you would really not want residents walking down there.

299
00:31:27,434 --> 00:31:42,630
[SPEAKER_07]: We had a solid discussion with the Community Development Board during the permitting process for that project about not even extending the sidewalk on that side to that ramp because it's so dangerous at that location.

300
00:31:43,052 --> 00:31:55,635
[SPEAKER_07]: that we felt strongly that people really ought to cross the road and they ought to go down the side away from the highway if they're gonna continue as pedestrians down that road rather than try and cross.

301
00:31:56,095 --> 00:32:06,718
[SPEAKER_07]: And in fact, if you were to cross that ramp on the highway side, you would then be walking along a long expanse of just a wall next to the highway for several blocks.

302
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:09,799
[SPEAKER_07]: So other than one bus stop down there,

303
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:13,001
[SPEAKER_07]: which you could catch that bus in front of Herb Chambers.

304
00:32:13,361 --> 00:32:16,043
[SPEAKER_07]: You wouldn't need to walk down there to get that bus stop.

305
00:32:16,383 --> 00:32:17,444
[SPEAKER_07]: You could get it right there.

306
00:32:17,904 --> 00:32:19,825
[SPEAKER_07]: There is no good reason to walk down there.

307
00:32:20,566 --> 00:32:25,329
[SPEAKER_07]: So that feels like an area that should be appropriate for auto uses.

308
00:32:25,469 --> 00:32:30,913
[SPEAKER_07]: The other use, so you can see the little white road that goes through that area.

309
00:32:31,353 --> 00:32:35,416
[SPEAKER_07]: Between that white road and the highway, a car wash

310
00:32:35,876 --> 00:32:43,040
[SPEAKER_07]: that has existed for a very long time, historic looking car wash, has just been approved for a major update there.

311
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:48,343
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're going to be refreshing and rebuilding the car wash between that little road and the highway.

312
00:32:48,764 --> 00:32:52,826
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's, again, a place where those uses felt appropriate back there.

313
00:32:54,025 --> 00:33:16,642
[SPEAKER_07]: So what we were recommending was to bring this commercial use that would be on the neighborhood side of Mystic Ave and also that end of the Mystic Ave on the highway side, and then have mixed use three, the dark purple for the length of it, and then buffering

314
00:33:17,282 --> 00:33:25,447
[SPEAKER_07]: the school, the playground, and the Medford Housing Authority properties, we were recommending a mixed-use one.

315
00:33:25,507 --> 00:33:33,272
[SPEAKER_07]: That actually was the recommendation out of this meeting, this committee last time, but it's now reflected on the map so everybody can see what that looks like.

316
00:33:35,133 --> 00:33:37,654
[SPEAKER_07]: So that we wanted to put that in front of you all.

317
00:33:37,694 --> 00:33:41,797
[SPEAKER_07]: We thought, I would say we felt kind of strongly that this made sense down here.

318
00:33:42,301 --> 00:33:51,789
[SPEAKER_07]: and not to immediately make those auto uses down there nonconforming when they feel like the right thing to be doing that close to the highway ramp.

319
00:33:53,270 --> 00:34:00,656
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll leave it there if there's any discussion, because I think then we wanted to move into talking about what uses would be allowed in the various zones.

320
00:34:00,716 --> 00:34:03,219
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's the next and the dimensional table.

321
00:34:03,539 --> 00:34:03,799
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

322
00:34:04,139 --> 00:34:05,280
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much for that update.

323
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,102
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, just to recenter on this.

324
00:34:07,142 --> 00:34:09,604
[SPEAKER_10]: So what's changed?

325
00:34:12,162 --> 00:34:13,322
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me get my cardinal directions right.

326
00:34:13,642 --> 00:34:17,763
[SPEAKER_10]: That blue zigzag, that was the recommendation of this committee at our last meeting.

327
00:34:18,343 --> 00:34:27,245
[SPEAKER_10]: The change that's being proposed newly as of this meeting is the section towards the south side that's split between pink and purple, which is mixed-use three and commercial.

328
00:34:28,126 --> 00:34:32,547
[SPEAKER_10]: The new recommendation is to have commercial on that side at all as opposed to mixed-use three all the way down.

329
00:34:33,267 --> 00:34:33,667
[SPEAKER_10]: President Behrs.

330
00:34:34,622 --> 00:34:42,184
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, and just to clarify, that's basically just the New Herb Chambers Old Century Bank, the Volkswagen dealership, and the car wash.

331
00:34:43,444 --> 00:34:43,804
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct.

332
00:34:44,064 --> 00:34:44,504
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

333
00:34:44,584 --> 00:34:45,384
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are the parcels.

334
00:34:45,484 --> 00:34:56,526
[SPEAKER_07]: And I will actually, I think, because it helps people to understand, where that purple starts, those are the parcels that are all currently owned by Combined Properties up until the very last parcel there.

335
00:34:56,846 --> 00:34:59,407
[SPEAKER_07]: So that entire section is owned by Combined Properties.

336
00:35:00,205 --> 00:35:05,067
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the, yes, I think the blue dogleg, I think we went a little.

337
00:35:05,087 --> 00:35:13,089
[SPEAKER_12]: I think on the far end of the Somerville border and the three parcels front that have frontage on Mystic Ave.

338
00:35:13,649 --> 00:35:15,110
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we should make those commercial.

339
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:24,553
[SPEAKER_12]: If you even look at that far, the last parcel in the city, even on the other side of the fence and the other side of East Albion Street, there's actually another industrial building.

340
00:35:25,205 --> 00:35:31,768
[SPEAKER_12]: on the other side of that, so it's not fronting, those last two lots, the back is not fronting residential property.

341
00:35:31,788 --> 00:35:37,650
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I had a question on that, and I think the one, the little, you know,

342
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:44,362
[SPEAKER_12]: That big long one that has that little driveway that you could see out to Mystic Ave, that's that big rear Mystic Ave thing.

343
00:35:44,862 --> 00:35:50,424
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that parcel immediately to the northwest is a gas station right now.

344
00:35:51,744 --> 00:35:53,045
[SPEAKER_12]: And it has that Mystic Ave frontage.

345
00:35:53,085 --> 00:35:55,766
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just think that should be commercial.

346
00:35:55,926 --> 00:36:02,968
[SPEAKER_12]: And then those two that abut the mass inspection site should be, you know, basically the SunRail border, that inspection site, those should be commercial as well.

347
00:36:03,728 --> 00:36:04,949
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I just had a question about,

348
00:36:07,659 --> 00:36:10,140
[SPEAKER_12]: I know we generally like to do the zones based on parcels.

349
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:13,300
[SPEAKER_12]: That rear mystic app parcel is a real funky parcel.

350
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:18,301
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm wondering, could we split that parcel into two different zones, or is that really not recommended?

351
00:36:22,242 --> 00:36:24,162
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it makes things more complicated.

352
00:36:24,622 --> 00:36:26,223
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

353
00:36:27,343 --> 00:36:29,183
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not illegal.

354
00:36:29,763 --> 00:36:30,664
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

355
00:36:31,144 --> 00:36:31,344
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

356
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:37,265
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just thinking, like, maybe just take everything where the commercial line

357
00:36:38,257 --> 00:36:40,218
[SPEAKER_07]: just make the commercial line straight.

358
00:36:40,258 --> 00:36:45,800
[SPEAKER_07]: So in theory, that would allow that one property owner who has that very large parcel.

359
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:52,582
[SPEAKER_07]: If people don't know what we're talking about, there appears to be a road called Rear Mystic Ave that runs all along the park there.

360
00:36:53,262 --> 00:36:56,283
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there's a building with many different units in it.

361
00:36:56,643 --> 00:37:05,367
[SPEAKER_07]: But it turns out that that road is just legally their driveway and is all on that parcel owned by the one property owner.

362
00:37:07,423 --> 00:37:20,632
[SPEAKER_07]: That would allow that property owner to have commercial uses up against Mystic Ave and then to just have the lower intensity uses in the back area that faces the park.

363
00:37:20,952 --> 00:37:23,414
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, that would be my recommendation there.

364
00:37:23,454 --> 00:37:26,056
[SPEAKER_12]: I know it would be kind of a little bit different than what we normally do.

365
00:37:28,683 --> 00:37:34,406
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we're fine with it, especially because we're not saying take a house parcel and divide it in two.

366
00:37:34,526 --> 00:37:36,207
[SPEAKER_07]: That's silly when we've seen them.

367
00:37:36,227 --> 00:37:40,449
[SPEAKER_12]: You'd be taking basically a giant driveway and a gas station and seeing if you could do something better with it.

368
00:37:40,469 --> 00:37:41,690
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that's worth trying.

369
00:37:44,511 --> 00:37:54,556
[SPEAKER_12]: So that would be my recommendation is maybe just take a straight line down to those last two parcels and then make all of that commercial that has that Mystic Ave frontage.

370
00:37:54,636 --> 00:37:57,898
[SPEAKER_12]: But then you still have the buffer zone with the park and the residential neighborhood.

371
00:38:02,418 --> 00:38:08,861
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

372
00:38:08,881 --> 00:38:26,831
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not normally in favor of splitting zones across lots, but so I'm looking at this on Google Earth just to, you know, confirm what Councilor Beres just mentioned.

373
00:38:26,891 --> 00:38:29,933
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think in this case, it could make sense.

374
00:38:30,823 --> 00:38:31,924
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it would make more sense.

375
00:38:31,944 --> 00:38:34,826
[SPEAKER_05]: Given what else is in the area does make it a little bit more complicated.

376
00:38:34,846 --> 00:38:41,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but, uh, you know, given what else is going on, I think it could could make more sense.

377
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:46,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Um uh, then keeping it a separate zone from the adjacent parcels.

378
00:38:49,816 --> 00:38:50,056
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

379
00:38:50,496 --> 00:38:51,036
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much.

380
00:38:51,076 --> 00:38:51,957
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate it.

381
00:38:52,277 --> 00:38:52,918
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, President Bears.

382
00:38:52,958 --> 00:38:54,619
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, thank you for entertaining this exception.

383
00:38:54,659 --> 00:38:55,279
[SPEAKER_10]: I think this makes

384
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:03,980
[SPEAKER_12]: Center.

385
00:39:05,701 --> 00:39:07,061
[SPEAKER_12]: It used to be Russo Marine.

386
00:39:18,705 --> 00:39:20,126
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, you might want to go to that.

387
00:39:20,146 --> 00:39:22,167
[SPEAKER_12]: No one can hear you.

388
00:39:24,158 --> 00:39:25,158
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, sorry about that.

389
00:39:25,258 --> 00:39:26,959
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not at my desk anymore.

390
00:39:27,779 --> 00:39:42,762
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so this, the northernmost commercial lot on the south side of the street, the sort of easternmost, just wondering about that being commercial as opposed to one of the mixed use, just because it does abut right up to the public housing.

391
00:39:45,822 --> 00:39:47,323
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's, it's a good question.

392
00:39:47,383 --> 00:39:52,684
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now it's used, the Walnut Street Center is used for people with

393
00:39:55,584 --> 00:39:58,007
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's actually where the Mystic Market is right now.

394
00:39:59,609 --> 00:40:03,754
[SPEAKER_07]: But the question is, what would happen if they ever moved or they closed?

395
00:40:04,054 --> 00:40:10,162
[SPEAKER_07]: And should there be allowed to be a large commercial industrial thing right there next to the public housing?

396
00:40:12,891 --> 00:40:15,674
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate to keep losing all our commercial industrial space.

397
00:40:16,194 --> 00:40:27,303
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I actually, one of my things that I wanna consider is what level of commercial industrial will we allow through the mixed use three, because I think we should not be losing our industrial base.

398
00:40:28,184 --> 00:40:32,608
[SPEAKER_07]: But personally, I agree with you that it shouldn't be pushed up right next to the public housing either.

399
00:40:32,628 --> 00:40:34,469
[SPEAKER_12]: President Burrs.

400
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:40,054
[SPEAKER_12]: I just will note that on the, and again, if we wanna do a walk or if we wanna just get a little more insight on it,

401
00:40:40,683 --> 00:40:44,444
[SPEAKER_12]: It looks like what might be a Medford Housing Authority maintenance building.

402
00:40:45,464 --> 00:40:54,767
[SPEAKER_12]: Basically the public housing, it looks like there's a large grass buffer and a maintenance building between that lot and the housing units themselves.

403
00:40:56,867 --> 00:41:06,250
[SPEAKER_12]: Obviously, but the way that the lot goes, it angles closer, the closer you get to Bonner Ave, but certainly where the Walnut Street Center is now versus the large parking lot.

404
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:13,736
[SPEAKER_12]: Basically, that looks like it's abutting a garage and an open grass area.

405
00:41:15,438 --> 00:41:19,663
[SPEAKER_12]: Looks like it's probably at least 100 feet, maybe more, from the housing units.

406
00:41:21,104 --> 00:41:21,885
[SPEAKER_10]: What about Planner Evans?

407
00:41:22,817 --> 00:41:43,906
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I did walk all of that, and it is not a residential building, but Medford Housing Authority is diligently re-paving and redoing a lot of their properties, and this one probably is slated at some point, probably after the pre's to be rehabilitated and changed.

408
00:41:43,986 --> 00:41:45,807
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very low rise, not a lot of

409
00:41:47,096 --> 00:41:54,060
[SPEAKER_01]: housing units there, so I wouldn't consider this set in stone and zone based on what's there now, but just.

410
00:41:55,341 --> 00:41:58,163
[SPEAKER_01]: It could it could be a housing unit in the back at some point.

411
00:42:04,126 --> 00:42:04,506
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

412
00:42:04,586 --> 00:42:07,928
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we want to entertain a change to this person as well?

413
00:42:09,369 --> 00:42:11,150
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, yeah, so.

414
00:42:12,231 --> 00:42:12,271
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm.

415
00:42:15,456 --> 00:42:23,701
[SPEAKER_06]: Then we will have it, in any case, abutting the next, which is also commercial.

416
00:42:23,721 --> 00:42:43,352
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if it's maybe better to have some kind of more setbacks when it abuts the, abutting a residential area, and so that it doesn't, it really doesn't have a lot of impact from the commercial

417
00:42:44,784 --> 00:42:59,134
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be light industrial, so it's never going to be very heavy, or the nuisance from the industrial shouldn't bother the residential areas.

418
00:42:59,834 --> 00:43:04,777
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know if I want to recommend that, to be honest.

419
00:43:05,318 --> 00:43:14,444
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that we can try to make it that if a BUDs residential, that it has to have some stricter norms.

420
00:43:16,423 --> 00:43:25,469
[SPEAKER_06]: So how do we make that transition to feel more at ease with everyone instead of losing the commercial?

421
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:36,477
[SPEAKER_06]: Because at a certain point, we're always going to have this type of residential or mixed use with the most commercial industrial.

422
00:43:37,057 --> 00:43:42,281
[SPEAKER_06]: But in any case, when we say industrial, it's not a heavy industrial, it's always going to be more

423
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:54,530
[SPEAKER_06]: light industrial, so it doesn't have, it shouldn't have the odors and the noise and the lighting that it can, that it will conflict with residential use.

424
00:43:56,667 --> 00:43:57,428
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Halihan, go ahead.

425
00:43:57,448 --> 00:43:57,768
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks.

426
00:43:58,188 --> 00:44:09,598
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just gonna want, out of my curiosity, like, is there a reason why this, because it seems like we have a distinction between these two, and like it would make more sense to the I if this was commercial than that was commercial?

427
00:44:09,618 --> 00:44:12,300
[SPEAKER_09]: Like just, you know, is there a reason why?

428
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:18,525
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it because of the size of the lots, or is there some reason why this is, excuse, and that's commercial instead of switching those?

429
00:44:18,665 --> 00:44:24,430
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, so the ones that you're pointing to, that entire group that's purple across there is owned by one owner,

430
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:31,714
[SPEAKER_07]: and so is likely to be developed as one project, or at least one project with phases.

431
00:44:31,734 --> 00:44:38,057
[SPEAKER_07]: And that, I don't know that that road needs to, I'm not sure what the status of that road is.

432
00:44:38,157 --> 00:44:40,898
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not clear that's a public way.

433
00:44:42,359 --> 00:44:43,820
[SPEAKER_07]: It is, okay, it's a private way.

434
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:46,321
[SPEAKER_12]: I think this map is deceptive as to what

435
00:44:47,552 --> 00:44:51,773
[SPEAKER_12]: really what that looks like is four different large buildings.

436
00:44:52,234 --> 00:45:00,877
[SPEAKER_12]: And the Fulbright Street definition is no different than the definition between the next parcel and the next large parcel visually, if you're looking at it.

437
00:45:03,398 --> 00:45:15,442
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I could see an argument for mixed use too for that Walnut Street Center lot, but lot size, existing condition, existing use, it feels a lot more similar to

438
00:45:16,584 --> 00:45:22,271
[SPEAKER_12]: the stuff south and east of it than it does to the things that are north of Bonner, to me.

439
00:45:22,371 --> 00:45:25,634
[SPEAKER_12]: So that would be, I'd be inclined to leave it as is.

440
00:45:27,757 --> 00:45:27,957
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

441
00:45:27,977 --> 00:45:36,867
[SPEAKER_07]: So when I just looked at, when you look at Google Street View, you would see, and so thank you, Daniel, also reminded me from, we looked at this when we did the approvals for the

442
00:45:38,101 --> 00:45:49,845
[SPEAKER_07]: car wash, that full bright street actually effectively ends at the parcel where that pink purple line is, because there's a gate at the end of it.

443
00:45:50,325 --> 00:46:02,150
[SPEAKER_07]: And so if you're down there, the rest just looks like parking lot, and you don't know that that is a street unless you're looking at it from Google Maps or an assessor's database type view.

444
00:46:04,951 --> 00:46:05,691
[SPEAKER_12]: And if I recall them.

445
00:46:06,549 --> 00:46:23,098
[SPEAKER_12]: life sciences combined proposal would have used a piece of that, like they would have tried to get it straight away from the 16 exit and then wrap it around to where to have basically an intersection where the pink purple line is, if I think I'm remembering that right.

446
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:26,640
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen so many versions of proposals from them.

447
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:28,481
[SPEAKER_07]: I couldn't tell you for sure.

448
00:46:31,503 --> 00:46:31,923
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

449
00:46:32,163 --> 00:46:35,545
[SPEAKER_10]: So interesting discussion.

450
00:46:36,129 --> 00:46:42,771
[SPEAKER_10]: as chair all the way to motion if we're going to propose a further tweak to that zone or leave as is.

451
00:46:43,791 --> 00:47:02,815
[SPEAKER_10]: But I do want to hasten us to what I believe is the last piece of our discussion for the Mystic Abzoning proposal tonight before it goes back to Innis Associates for, you know, to wrap up all of these final tweaks and comments so that we can take a vote to report it out on October 23rd.

452
00:47:03,135 --> 00:47:05,136
[SPEAKER_10]: And that is to consider quickly

453
00:47:05,828 --> 00:47:18,120
[SPEAKER_10]: the dimensional table, table of uses, because that informs when we're talking about these zones, what actually will be done and performed within them in all of these zones that we're just describing in abstract terms right now.

454
00:47:21,043 --> 00:47:28,751
[SPEAKER_10]: Paola, remind me, was this one of the materials that we sent around to the committee on Friday, or is this a later breaking document?

455
00:47:30,615 --> 00:47:34,076
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, no, we've seen the ones we sent on Friday.

456
00:47:34,096 --> 00:47:35,737
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, okay, excellent.

457
00:47:35,757 --> 00:47:36,637
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

458
00:47:37,637 --> 00:47:38,798
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, I couldn't remember off the top of my head.

459
00:47:38,838 --> 00:47:43,339
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been a long day, but that's great, as intended, circulated to councillors prior to the meeting.

460
00:47:44,339 --> 00:47:58,304
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'd like to ask my fellow committee members, you know, to lead off the discussion if there are any aspects of the proposed dimensionals, aspects of the table of uses that we'd like to flag for question or comment.

461
00:47:58,547 --> 00:47:58,707
[SPEAKER_07]: question.

462
00:47:58,727 --> 00:48:11,852
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I ask one clarification just because so this table has five columns on it, and one of them is MX four, and it is my understanding that there is no MX four currently on the map.

463
00:48:12,612 --> 00:48:14,693
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just want to make sure that that is

464
00:48:21,072 --> 00:48:25,455
[SPEAKER_06]: That was from the previous option that we had with Mix 4.

465
00:48:26,316 --> 00:48:28,057
[SPEAKER_06]: But now we don't have Mix 4.

466
00:48:28,117 --> 00:48:33,641
[SPEAKER_06]: We only have Mix 1, 2, and 3, and then the commercial.

467
00:48:33,661 --> 00:48:36,503
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

468
00:48:37,183 --> 00:48:38,484
[SPEAKER_12]: That was one of my questions, too.

469
00:48:40,765 --> 00:48:41,086
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

470
00:48:41,966 --> 00:48:42,467
[SPEAKER_10]: Go ahead, Professor.

471
00:48:42,487 --> 00:48:43,107
[SPEAKER_12]: I do have two.

472
00:48:44,448 --> 00:48:47,910
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if they're exactly copy editing kind of more things.

473
00:48:49,665 --> 00:48:57,167
[SPEAKER_12]: On the MX3 max height under the incentive zoning, I just think that that should say podium for tower 10 instead of tower eight.

474
00:48:57,247 --> 00:49:02,008
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that a typo?

475
00:49:02,068 --> 00:49:03,328
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, one second.

476
00:49:09,049 --> 00:49:09,910
[SPEAKER_06]: In which mix use?

477
00:49:10,970 --> 00:49:14,051
[SPEAKER_12]: It's an MX3 max height for incentive zoning.

478
00:49:15,671 --> 00:49:15,971
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

479
00:49:17,722 --> 00:49:18,543
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, sorry.

480
00:49:18,583 --> 00:49:19,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it's a typo.

481
00:49:19,824 --> 00:49:21,486
[SPEAKER_06]: It's podium four plus tower 10.

482
00:49:23,047 --> 00:49:24,349
[SPEAKER_06]: So in total, 14.

483
00:49:25,370 --> 00:49:25,950
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

484
00:49:26,891 --> 00:49:31,155
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I just have one other question, which was base height versus minimum height.

485
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:38,423
[SPEAKER_12]: Is this, is that, did we have that in the last proposal?

486
00:49:40,103 --> 00:49:53,749
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I usually recommend to have a minimum height so that we don't encounter situations where you have the maximum and then next to it a one-story building.

487
00:49:53,829 --> 00:50:03,293
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I also place minimum base and the maximum will only be achievable by incentive zoning.

488
00:50:05,307 --> 00:50:11,849
[SPEAKER_12]: I think three, a minimum height of three where the base height is four and MX one and MX two, I get that.

489
00:50:12,309 --> 00:50:20,552
[SPEAKER_12]: I just feel like the further, I feel like the four minimum in commercial and certainly in MX three might be a little bit too low.

490
00:50:20,572 --> 00:50:27,454
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, there'd just be a huge gap if you had a bunch of, if you had a 10 story or a 14 story next to a four story.

491
00:50:28,095 --> 00:50:32,536
[SPEAKER_12]: And I wonder what we think about maybe a higher minimum height for those two districts.

492
00:50:33,678 --> 00:50:41,380
[SPEAKER_06]: So the MX3, because we have the podium, and then the whatever you have extra is going to be above.

493
00:50:42,041 --> 00:50:44,261
[SPEAKER_06]: So you don't see that difference so much.

494
00:50:45,382 --> 00:50:50,523
[SPEAKER_06]: If I have then another one that is only four, it's very continuous with the podium.

495
00:50:50,583 --> 00:50:52,704
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why that's the minimum.

496
00:50:55,044 --> 00:51:03,087
[SPEAKER_06]: With the commercial, if we are going to have, and this is the thing, if we have auto,

497
00:51:04,006 --> 00:51:05,848
[SPEAKER_06]: uses usually are lower.

498
00:51:06,629 --> 00:51:18,900
[SPEAKER_06]: And so in here, I need to discuss internally more this minimum because it might be that they don't even are able to reach the minimum of four.

499
00:51:19,501 --> 00:51:27,968
[SPEAKER_06]: And so if we go to special permit or site plan review, then that is easier to understand those transitions to make it a bit better.

500
00:51:30,902 --> 00:51:41,427
[SPEAKER_06]: So I need to internally research a bit more this commercial minimum to see exactly how that will be.

501
00:51:41,467 --> 00:51:46,470
[SPEAKER_06]: But I wouldn't raise it a lot more because I don't think that we would have.

502
00:51:48,891 --> 00:51:54,694
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think that with four and six and eight, it's something that I can see a transition that it's OK.

503
00:51:55,926 --> 00:51:57,107
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not worried.

504
00:51:57,227 --> 00:51:59,247
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm worried that then we have eight and one.

505
00:51:59,487 --> 00:52:02,188
[SPEAKER_06]: That's when I'm a bit more concerned.

506
00:52:03,369 --> 00:52:05,190
[SPEAKER_12]: And I see what you're saying about the podium.

507
00:52:05,410 --> 00:52:10,432
[SPEAKER_12]: So that makes sense.

508
00:52:12,512 --> 00:52:13,573
[SPEAKER_12]: Those were my questions.

509
00:52:14,568 --> 00:52:15,729
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, President Barras, Director Hunt.

510
00:52:15,850 --> 00:52:16,610
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, sorry, go ahead.

511
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:18,493
[SPEAKER_11]: Through the chair, thank you.

512
00:52:19,814 --> 00:52:21,236
[SPEAKER_11]: Just one comment on that.

513
00:52:22,297 --> 00:52:32,669
[SPEAKER_11]: If you make a minimum requirement of four stories, you're going to eliminate a lot of commercial, industrial users because

514
00:52:34,711 --> 00:52:45,494
[SPEAKER_11]: putting anything beyond a second story is usually something that you don't see because the third and fourth stories are not really useful there.

515
00:52:45,574 --> 00:52:49,735
[SPEAKER_11]: So there could be some unintended consequences there.

516
00:52:50,375 --> 00:53:00,657
[SPEAKER_11]: I met with a family, a Medford family business recently who expressed interest in, in a property on Mystic and, um,

517
00:53:01,217 --> 00:53:09,020
[SPEAKER_11]: They had said, you know, I understand we could build higher and do residential, but that's not our business.

518
00:53:10,181 --> 00:53:18,904
[SPEAKER_11]: So we don't want to, you know, create a building with three or four stories, because that's outside of our expertise.

519
00:53:20,325 --> 00:53:24,467
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, I'm afraid we would lose businesses like that.

520
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:24,967
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

521
00:53:27,508 --> 00:53:28,048
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

522
00:53:29,679 --> 00:53:33,000
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, just to clarify, was that across all the zones?

523
00:53:34,361 --> 00:53:36,402
[SPEAKER_07]: Any zones that you're going to allow industrial?

524
00:53:36,862 --> 00:53:37,863
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, so just the commercial.

525
00:53:37,883 --> 00:53:43,265
[SPEAKER_12]: I get where you're coming from, but I worry about doing that in an MX3.

526
00:53:44,866 --> 00:53:47,107
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we might need to have a little bit of a compromise there.

527
00:53:47,127 --> 00:53:49,347
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

528
00:53:49,448 --> 00:53:50,388
[SPEAKER_07]: And I see where they're going.

529
00:53:50,488 --> 00:53:56,791
[SPEAKER_07]: I was thinking that for the industrial, for the commercial, we shouldn't have a minimum because we'll lose industry for that.

530
00:53:58,789 --> 00:54:04,092
[SPEAKER_07]: The MX3, I think we still haven't quite figured out.

531
00:54:04,712 --> 00:54:11,656
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now, the recommended permitted uses in MX3 does not include industrial at all.

532
00:54:14,897 --> 00:54:15,638
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe it should.

533
00:54:15,658 --> 00:54:18,479
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I actually think we should have a conversation about that.

534
00:54:18,539 --> 00:54:19,980
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe it should be allowed.

535
00:54:20,612 --> 00:54:24,534
[SPEAKER_07]: But do you actually want a one story light industrial building there?

536
00:54:25,294 --> 00:54:33,518
[SPEAKER_07]: If you had an industrial building that was smaller scale stuff, and I think we were thinking R&D type stuff.

537
00:54:36,839 --> 00:54:42,161
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, maybe just for the commercial section, we should not have a minimum number of stories.

538
00:54:43,322 --> 00:54:47,784
[SPEAKER_07]: Unless we said one, as in you must have a building, like it can't be an open,

539
00:54:50,121 --> 00:55:01,888
[SPEAKER_05]: If I may, Madam Chair, the other thing to consider is that certain industrial buildings may be a single story, but they may be double height, right?

540
00:55:01,928 --> 00:55:14,816
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, and this again depends on the uses you want, where a lab building may have a higher floor to floor, a warehouse distribution right next to the highway.

541
00:55:15,756 --> 00:55:20,577
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, you know, Amazon buildings are at least 30 feet tall, but it's a single story.

542
00:55:21,217 --> 00:55:39,202
[SPEAKER_05]: So that might be something else, uh, as, uh, Paola and I and the others discuss internally some of these minimums that we might also want to take into consideration for the commercial, industrial, maybe there's a, a minimum, there's a discussion of height versus stories in that.

543
00:55:39,282 --> 00:55:42,322
[SPEAKER_05]: So something else we can, we can take back from this conversation.

544
00:55:43,983 --> 00:55:44,523
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Emily.

545
00:55:44,543 --> 00:55:44,923
[SPEAKER_10]: President Burris.

546
00:55:45,404 --> 00:55:45,724
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks.

547
00:55:45,784 --> 00:55:49,448
[SPEAKER_12]: And yeah, I mean, I think part of this goes back to the definition of industrial, right?

548
00:55:49,488 --> 00:55:58,195
[SPEAKER_12]: If we're talking like fab space and an MX3, that makes sense to me, but I don't think it should be one story or even a double height, single story structure.

549
00:55:58,215 --> 00:55:58,255
[SPEAKER_12]: So.

550
00:55:58,275 --> 00:56:05,582
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, my inclination, I think we need to talk about the industrial.

551
00:56:08,069 --> 00:56:33,312
[SPEAKER_12]: go through that industrial list a little bit more and decide what we think makes sense in an MX3 where the minimum height is four stories, and what might make sense in commercial where the minimum height, and maybe the minimum height in commercial is one story, but we can say that it could be double height, or maybe we could say that that ground floor story could have a higher maximum for commercial.

552
00:56:34,468 --> 00:56:38,333
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't love the idea of having a distribution center on Mystic Ave.

553
00:56:39,915 --> 00:56:47,806
[SPEAKER_12]: I get why it was raised as an example, but I just don't think it's highest and best use and where we're trying to go with this.

554
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:49,629
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's just my two cents.

555
00:56:51,451 --> 00:56:51,931
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I know.

556
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:56,175
[SPEAKER_07]: One would be to do special permit for certain.

557
00:56:56,355 --> 00:56:58,556
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, could you do a minimum height by special permit?

558
00:56:58,836 --> 00:57:04,881
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I do notice, for example, one of the parcels that's currently in the MX3 is actually our DPW.

559
00:57:06,202 --> 00:57:09,104
[SPEAKER_07]: But I mean, it's exempt because it is our DPW.

560
00:57:11,306 --> 00:57:14,288
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you allowed a lower height by special permit,

561
00:57:15,888 --> 00:57:25,055
[SPEAKER_07]: And I do like the idea of it being feet rather than stories because the intention, well, I guess there's two levels of intention.

562
00:57:25,135 --> 00:57:31,740
[SPEAKER_07]: What is the value of this building and what is the tax revenue that is coming off of it?

563
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:35,503
[SPEAKER_07]: And two floors is more tax revenue than a double height floor?

564
00:57:37,044 --> 00:57:39,666
[SPEAKER_07]: Theoretically, depending what the value of that use is.

565
00:57:41,687 --> 00:57:45,130
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you're thinking of it from an aesthetic way,

566
00:57:46,266 --> 00:57:49,327
[SPEAKER_07]: it's actually like, what are you like looking at?

567
00:57:49,727 --> 00:57:57,228
[SPEAKER_07]: And one might say like along there right now, we have Theory Wellness with the Arts Center, that's two stories, but only in a tiny bit of it.

568
00:57:58,289 --> 00:58:02,089
[SPEAKER_07]: Most of it is single story, but it looks two story.

569
00:58:02,670 --> 00:58:11,291
[SPEAKER_07]: There's the Beer Hall, that's a little bit of a second story, but it's big.

570
00:58:11,311 --> 00:58:13,612
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I think the way around it is just to say,

571
00:58:14,679 --> 00:58:18,542
[SPEAKER_12]: In commercial, the max ground floor height can be 30 feet.

572
00:58:19,583 --> 00:58:24,027
[SPEAKER_12]: And if we want to drop it down to one floor, then you could have a double height if you wanted.

573
00:58:25,188 --> 00:58:26,289
[SPEAKER_12]: Drop the minimum down to one.

574
00:58:31,714 --> 00:58:33,756
[SPEAKER_10]: So the suggestion would be rather than instituting a

575
00:58:35,478 --> 00:58:39,999
[SPEAKER_10]: rather than instituting no minimums for commercial to state a maximum ground floor height in commercial?

576
00:58:40,239 --> 00:58:41,279
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, we could go down to it.

577
00:58:41,319 --> 00:58:52,341
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, if that's what folks think, if that's the only way we're going to keep industrial uses potentially is to have a minimum height in the commercial district of one story, I think that's fine.

578
00:58:53,221 --> 00:59:02,203
[SPEAKER_12]: And that if we need those stories to be tall, I would just change the ground floor maximum to be whatever that height needs to be.

579
00:59:07,694 --> 00:59:08,454
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm amenable to that.

580
00:59:08,514 --> 00:59:15,197
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I'm also, I understand the need to keep some industry, the possibility of industrial open, certainly.

581
00:59:15,217 --> 00:59:26,341
[SPEAKER_10]: I also, you know, see that in the context of trying to develop new zoning that will entice, you know, kind of making maximum use of this corridor.

582
00:59:26,361 --> 00:59:32,423
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm also amenable to the kind of suggestion of one story by special permit.

583
00:59:36,445 --> 00:59:37,405
[SPEAKER_10]: But it sounds like

584
00:59:40,689 --> 00:59:53,074
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel like I'm hearing comfort with the concept of a minimum height of one story in commercial with that max ground floor height set at 30 feet.

585
00:59:54,634 --> 00:59:58,316
[SPEAKER_12]: And if it needs to be 35 feet or 28 feet or whatever you guys think.

586
00:59:58,456 --> 00:59:59,016
[SPEAKER_12]: Something around that.

587
00:59:59,416 --> 00:59:59,716
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

588
00:59:59,896 --> 01:00:00,917
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think we missed that.

589
01:00:01,657 --> 01:00:06,919
[SPEAKER_07]: They were looking for the maximum height of the first floor.

590
01:00:07,827 --> 01:00:19,134
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I, I'm wondering, I can see in some neighborhoods why you might want to have in a large city like maximum and minimum heights for your first floor for aesthetic reasons.

591
01:00:20,035 --> 01:00:23,417
[SPEAKER_07]: But when you're talking about industrial buildings, I think it's different.

592
01:00:24,657 --> 01:00:24,998
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

593
01:00:26,499 --> 01:00:28,680
[SPEAKER_07]: And actually, I don't know.

594
01:00:30,006 --> 01:00:39,372
[SPEAKER_07]: In Boston, I believe, at least in some zones, they are starting to require much taller first floors for a climate change reason.

595
01:00:39,893 --> 01:00:57,105
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if they get to the point where they need to raise the level of the roads because of sea level rise, if they had a double height first floor, you could literally just raise your first floor and now have a single height first floor at your new street level.

596
01:00:58,004 --> 01:01:09,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I don't know that we're going to get there with this, but I'm invited to a meeting on next Friday to talk about 2070 and sea level rise and becoming a coastal city.

597
01:01:09,909 --> 01:01:12,410
[SPEAKER_12]: So, sorry.

598
01:01:12,530 --> 01:01:14,131
[SPEAKER_12]: We need a higher dam, that's what I said.

599
01:01:14,531 --> 01:01:16,432
[SPEAKER_07]: We have hurricanes on the mind right now.

600
01:01:16,452 --> 01:01:17,792
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

601
01:01:17,832 --> 01:01:21,794
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a grim world.

602
01:01:22,509 --> 01:01:23,450
[SPEAKER_10]: I do see a hand on Zoom.

603
01:01:23,470 --> 01:01:27,772
[SPEAKER_10]: We will take public participation soon when we finish up with this item.

604
01:01:27,792 --> 01:01:28,353
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much.

605
01:01:31,074 --> 01:01:41,260
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I mean, whatever you... I'm open to whatever you think needs to be the minimum height and the ground floor height to allow the industrial uses.

606
01:01:42,241 --> 01:01:45,383
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess, Sal, if you don't mind me asking from an economic development perspective,

607
01:01:46,761 --> 01:02:02,974
[SPEAKER_12]: Is the thinking just like we want to have some options left for these kinds of uses or you know why it just feels to me, I mean this like certain things I get like some sort of fab vacation site that's close by to a life science tower that makes sense to me, but.

608
01:02:03,814 --> 01:02:09,339
[SPEAKER_12]: Like an Amazon truck distribution site like that doesn't make sense to me, so I guess i'm just wondering what the thought is.

609
01:02:09,918 --> 01:02:15,743
[SPEAKER_11]: No, that's a really good question, Councilor, through the Chair, if I could address that.

610
01:02:16,003 --> 01:02:35,258
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think, you know, one of the concerns that we have is that, you know, with technology and the advancement of technology and things like AI and just where we're headed in things like clean tech,

611
01:02:36,030 --> 01:02:50,185
[SPEAKER_11]: and other industries that there are things that, you know, really haven't been commercialized yet, but are being worked on in universities like Tufts that you would hate to exclude.

612
01:02:52,348 --> 01:02:56,929
[SPEAKER_11]: and could be something that is started in Medford.

613
01:02:56,949 --> 01:03:00,870
[SPEAKER_11]: It maybe ends up, you know, being the next big, big thing.

614
01:03:01,790 --> 01:03:07,291
[SPEAKER_11]: So we don't wanna necessarily, you know, wipe that off the table.

615
01:03:07,351 --> 01:03:19,434
[SPEAKER_11]: We wanna keep some of that flexibility, you know, so I think that's some of the thinking that, you know, leave some options on the table for things that aren't yet discussed.

616
01:03:19,514 --> 01:03:20,334
[SPEAKER_11]: I met with,

617
01:03:21,514 --> 01:03:31,245
[SPEAKER_11]: someone recently who said, I don't know, over 20 new companies were formed out of Tufts, new spinoffs in the technology space.

618
01:03:32,246 --> 01:03:39,554
[SPEAKER_11]: And I wanted to talk about how can we capture those companies, keep them at Medford before they go somewhere else.

619
01:03:39,614 --> 01:03:42,076
[SPEAKER_11]: And part of that is space availability.

620
01:03:44,498 --> 01:03:48,699
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that having some flexibility where it makes sense is good.

621
01:03:49,059 --> 01:03:55,061
[SPEAKER_11]: And your point about the Amazon distribution center is a good one.

622
01:03:55,621 --> 01:03:58,542
[SPEAKER_11]: However, in my experience, they're usually

623
01:03:59,142 --> 01:04:01,723
[SPEAKER_11]: they're looking for, you know, big chunks of land.

624
01:04:01,763 --> 01:04:12,907
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, that probably would not be a good space for them, or a similar type of business, because it can't achieve economies of scale.

625
01:04:14,168 --> 01:04:25,312
[SPEAKER_11]: But you know, some of the other uses, like self storage, or automotive repair, or things that we have, you know, what we say is, we don't want to get the crumbs from other communities.

626
01:04:25,892 --> 01:04:29,497
[SPEAKER_11]: for non-desirable uses that are being pushed out.

627
01:04:29,617 --> 01:04:39,930
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's the balancing act here is restricting some of those while leaving a little bit of flexibility for new companies to grow and locate here.

628
01:04:40,370 --> 01:04:40,650
[SPEAKER_12]: Got it.

629
01:04:41,290 --> 01:04:53,933
[SPEAKER_12]: I think maybe my motion would then be for this, that the steering committee discuss the industrial uses and whatever height and story height requirements are needed to maintain them.

630
01:04:54,493 --> 01:05:00,274
[SPEAKER_12]: And we kind of come back with a coherent just table that includes those items.

631
01:05:00,735 --> 01:05:06,376
[SPEAKER_12]: Cause I think we have to go back and look at the uses anyway, um, between the MX three and the commercial.

632
01:05:06,396 --> 01:05:06,436
[SPEAKER_12]: So,

633
01:05:08,735 --> 01:05:13,197
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think to me, that's the last big outstanding question here of all of this.

634
01:05:13,317 --> 01:05:15,378
[SPEAKER_12]: But, you know, that's just my opinion.

635
01:05:17,678 --> 01:05:18,599
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

636
01:05:20,139 --> 01:05:21,540
[SPEAKER_10]: If I'm.

637
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:22,360
[SPEAKER_10]: One second, Paola.

638
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:22,680
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

639
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:23,020
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead.

640
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:23,441
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

641
01:05:27,691 --> 01:05:32,055
[SPEAKER_02]: President Baird, I just wanted to read your motion back just to make sure I have it.

642
01:05:32,896 --> 01:05:38,861
[SPEAKER_02]: President Baird has moved that the steering committee discuss the industrial uses and whatever height and story height requirements are needed to maintain them.

643
01:05:39,682 --> 01:05:39,902
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

644
01:05:40,302 --> 01:05:40,603
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

645
01:05:40,803 --> 01:05:40,983
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

646
01:05:41,263 --> 01:05:42,925
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a second on that?

647
01:05:42,965 --> 01:05:43,905
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a second on the motion?

648
01:05:45,167 --> 01:05:46,528
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's just being decided to end it.

649
01:05:46,568 --> 01:05:46,748
[SPEAKER_10]: Cool.

650
01:05:46,888 --> 01:05:48,830
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we're just adding it to the list.

651
01:05:48,990 --> 01:05:49,270
[SPEAKER_10]: Go ahead.

652
01:05:49,290 --> 01:05:50,011
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll recognize you, Paola.

653
01:05:51,601 --> 01:05:56,824
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, so I think that question from President Burris is very important.

654
01:05:57,024 --> 01:06:04,428
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to understand how do we see that commercial district and what are those characteristics.

655
01:06:04,869 --> 01:06:10,832
[SPEAKER_06]: So what uses and what specific industrial or commercial we want there.

656
01:06:12,628 --> 01:06:25,538
[SPEAKER_06]: And so if it's more like a innovation district or startup kind of building, maybe we don't need the height to be eight floors the maximum, and it can be reduced.

657
01:06:25,658 --> 01:06:37,448
[SPEAKER_06]: And so then we can study better the height between the floors to be really kind of more appropriate for those uses.

658
01:06:37,847 --> 01:06:42,190
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it's more about really understanding what are the characteristics.

659
01:06:42,291 --> 01:07:03,748
[SPEAKER_06]: Because if we leave it too flexible and we have a lab of... So what I don't think that you would like to see is to have a lab building and next to it an auto repair shop and then next to it another tower so that you get very mixed and not really a very...

660
01:07:07,366 --> 01:07:10,568
[SPEAKER_06]: coherent district that's, yeah.

661
01:07:12,869 --> 01:07:13,429
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Paola.

662
01:07:13,489 --> 01:07:30,598
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I think that there's been a lot of good kind of guiding questions floated by counselors and city staff in this discussion that should guide us as city staff and the zoning consultant kind of more deeply consider

663
01:07:31,345 --> 01:07:56,757
[SPEAKER_10]: the table of uses for MX3 and commercial so that we, you know, kind of the same questions that we have been talking about, but just getting to a more granular place as we finalize this, which is, you know, how do we make sure that our zoning makes it harder for people to do things here that we really don't want them to do, that we don't want Mystic App being used for anymore, while making it accessible for the types of uses that we really do want to be cultivating and attracting, while

664
01:07:58,294 --> 01:08:06,341
[SPEAKER_10]: having a coherent enough, comfortable enough experience for people who do business along the stick out and the residents nearby.

665
01:08:10,404 --> 01:08:10,984
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Callahan.

666
01:08:11,765 --> 01:08:12,826
[SPEAKER_08]: Just super quick.

667
01:08:12,966 --> 01:08:16,809
[SPEAKER_08]: We still are intending to have a co-working definition added.

668
01:08:16,829 --> 01:08:22,013
[SPEAKER_09]: Since it was mentioned that like a co-working space, I just wanted to double check.

669
01:08:27,674 --> 01:08:33,097
[SPEAKER_10]: Paola or Emily, has there been a co-working definition added to the table of uses or can we do that for?

670
01:08:34,658 --> 01:08:36,619
[SPEAKER_06]: We haven't done that yet.

671
01:08:37,740 --> 01:08:42,262
[SPEAKER_06]: Co-working, yeah, we were thinking about the co-working and we have talked about that before.

672
01:08:42,282 --> 01:08:52,628
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was more specific for the neighborhood kind of notes of commercial notes in the neighborhood areas.

673
01:08:53,909 --> 01:08:54,089
[SPEAKER_06]: But

674
01:08:54,562 --> 01:09:03,193
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's interesting, we can totally look at for also a more industrial or research type of use.

675
01:09:03,333 --> 01:09:04,755
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we can do that.

676
01:09:06,499 --> 01:09:30,490
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I just ask, so about co-working, it is my understanding, I would just consider that to be office space, but the reason for having the co-working definition and putting it in there is to signal to the industry that we would like to see that here, but that I think that if they came to us with a co-working proposal, we would just consider it office space and just wherever that's allowed.

677
01:09:32,751 --> 01:09:35,372
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there something, yeah, I was gonna say, is there something different to it than that?

678
01:09:37,759 --> 01:09:38,559
[SPEAKER_10]: Go ahead, Councilor Calderon.

679
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:48,926
[SPEAKER_09]: All I know is that when I was doing some research into it, it seemed like co-working spaces had difficulty finding an appropriate place within zoning in most cities, and I don't remember exactly why.

680
01:09:49,066 --> 01:09:50,867
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm looking to see if I can find why.

681
01:09:50,887 --> 01:09:52,448
[SPEAKER_09]: I might be able to find it in about one minute.

682
01:09:53,508 --> 01:10:07,497
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I think that we think of it as something that might be appropriate as a retail, like, I'm picturing, frankly, my parents' town and one of the first floor retail spaces in downtown,

683
01:10:08,038 --> 01:10:11,200
[SPEAKER_07]: If you walk by and look closely, you realize it's all little co-op.

684
01:10:11,581 --> 01:10:15,304
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a co-working place with people and a little coffee and stuff like that.

685
01:10:15,704 --> 01:10:21,108
[SPEAKER_07]: And it feels active because of it's different people in there all the time coming and going.

686
01:10:22,209 --> 01:10:31,816
[SPEAKER_07]: And you could go rent the space for an hour or a week, but that could be so like they were going into retail spaces.

687
01:10:32,757 --> 01:10:34,218
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that might be part of it.

688
01:10:35,566 --> 01:10:36,446
[SPEAKER_05]: I would agree with that.

689
01:10:36,886 --> 01:10:52,332
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have a active ground floor use and a co-working space isn't defined as an active ground floor use, if it's considered as office and offices that are not allowed as the active ground floor, that can be difficult to do.

690
01:10:52,352 --> 01:11:01,175
[SPEAKER_05]: Some zoning enforcement officers too will have a stricter definition sometimes.

691
01:11:01,675 --> 01:11:04,936
[SPEAKER_05]: So they may say, look, it's not exactly an office.

692
01:11:05,837 --> 01:11:12,787
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can't have it here, whereas others are more willing to fit it into a higher level of definition.

693
01:11:13,928 --> 01:11:20,238
[SPEAKER_05]: So that could, you know, that's a second reason why co-working has not always been able to fit within a community.

694
01:11:21,058 --> 01:11:35,207
[SPEAKER_05]: And to Director Hunt's point, the idea that you are signaling with your definitions in your table of uses that you are open to specific uses, you're welcoming specific uses.

695
01:11:35,948 --> 01:11:44,514
[SPEAKER_05]: It's almost a marketing document at that point for what the city wants to see as an important consideration as we build this table of uses out.

696
01:11:46,955 --> 01:11:47,475
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Emily.

697
01:11:47,515 --> 01:11:48,216
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Callahan, go ahead.

698
01:11:48,812 --> 01:11:49,173
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

699
01:11:49,553 --> 01:12:00,505
[SPEAKER_09]: And just to close up that thought I found the whole thread that I had run into before, and they are in fact talking about the fact that a lot of co working spaces want to be in retail, where there's zone for retail.

700
01:12:01,746 --> 01:12:10,736
[SPEAKER_09]: And they don't want to be shunted off into like commercial office space zones because it doesn't really work for co working nobody wants to rent there if it is in that space so

701
01:12:11,463 --> 01:12:38,846
[SPEAKER_09]: as long as we're aiming toward, like this whole idea of mixed use, maybe, you know, it'll fit perfectly in there, but as long as that's in our minds, and I think, yes, we will wanna have co-working definitions, both to promote it, as well as to enable it to be the tiny little, in the same way that retail in our code, I don't know if we're continuing this, has different definitions for like,

702
01:12:40,087 --> 01:12:59,203
[SPEAKER_09]: convenience store and other kinds of stores that have different sizes, there may be usefulness to having that sort of definition for co-working so that we can have like neighborhood co-working spaces that are tiny in, you know, more across the residential neighborhoods, as well as be able to have more ones like on Mystic Ave.

703
01:12:59,623 --> 01:12:59,903
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks.

704
01:13:01,585 --> 01:13:02,525
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Cullohan.

705
01:13:07,591 --> 01:13:20,755
[SPEAKER_10]: Are there any further comments or questions that we want to raise for NS Associates city staff on the table of uses and definitions before we close out discussion of this topic?

706
01:13:25,156 --> 01:13:27,517
[SPEAKER_10]: Seeing none, to recap, I think that- If I may?

707
01:13:27,877 --> 01:13:28,897
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Councilor Calderon, go ahead.

708
01:13:28,957 --> 01:13:29,597
[SPEAKER_09]: I apologize.

709
01:13:29,878 --> 01:13:30,678
[SPEAKER_09]: Only because

710
01:13:32,832 --> 01:13:39,896
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. DiStefano, you had mentioned the idea of tough students and how many businesses they were coming out with.

711
01:13:40,636 --> 01:13:55,904
[SPEAKER_09]: And it made me think about the spaces, not just co-working spaces, but for example, in Kendall Square, they also have places where they have accelerator programs.

712
01:13:56,865 --> 01:14:00,887
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't know whether that would be something at all interesting to us or if it would be

713
01:14:01,334 --> 01:14:23,230
[SPEAKER_09]: if there's any difference between that and co-working, if there's any reason to define it differently, but just in the back of our minds to think about how do we have a technology hub here in Medford, where not just from Tufts, but also from maybe some sort of tech hub, a startup generator, if we can encourage that.

714
01:14:25,443 --> 01:14:26,804
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's a great idea.

715
01:14:26,824 --> 01:14:51,542
[SPEAKER_11]: I went to a ribbon cutting last week with the mayor to a company that is making, it's called Unravel, and they are doing specialty work with childhood, rare childhood diseases, like one in 100 people in the world have, and they're using genome sequencing and different things.

716
01:14:52,142 --> 01:14:59,430
[SPEAKER_11]: And I spoke to the CEO, and he's in a building in Boston Ave that's owned by Tufts.

717
01:14:59,650 --> 01:15:12,983
[SPEAKER_11]: And he had said one of the main reasons why he chose this area was that Medford is still close enough to Boston, so he can get to meet with other companies quickly.

718
01:15:13,965 --> 01:15:22,336
[SPEAKER_11]: There was parking availability, which is really rare, and, you know, some flexible space to do this.

719
01:15:23,238 --> 01:15:30,267
[SPEAKER_11]: And he had said that, you know, even though many of his employees are remote when they come in, he wants that quality of life.

720
01:15:31,088 --> 01:15:43,979
[SPEAKER_11]: And he was just like, you know, whatever I could do to support more space like this or tell the story of why as a CEO of a biotech company, I moved out of Boston to Medford.

721
01:15:44,459 --> 01:15:46,901
[SPEAKER_11]: He's like, I'd be happy to share that.

722
01:15:47,742 --> 01:15:49,043
[SPEAKER_11]: and a discussion about Tufts.

723
01:15:49,503 --> 01:16:01,911
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, making it easy for companies to stay here is key because a lot of times why they choose to go to a certain location is just availability of the space that they need.

724
01:16:03,372 --> 01:16:05,854
[SPEAKER_11]: So I definitely support that idea.

725
01:16:07,895 --> 01:16:09,376
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much, Sal.

726
01:16:10,396 --> 01:16:16,799
[SPEAKER_10]: It's nice to be able to infuse these conversations about the nitty gritty and with the visioning that guides what we're trying to do here.

727
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:17,680
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you both.

728
01:16:19,701 --> 01:16:35,969
[SPEAKER_10]: To summarize, coming out of this meeting, we are incorporating some updates to the housing definitions around co-living, co-housing, and dormitory on the Mystic Ave zoning proposal, which is nearing completion.

729
01:16:37,134 --> 01:16:44,758
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, we have some minor additional adjustments to, um, the land use map, as we discussed.

730
01:16:45,919 --> 01:16:51,422
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, a couple specific motions were made detailing those requested changes.

731
01:16:51,442 --> 01:17:03,088
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, and in addition, I think we have a directive to city staff and the zoning consultant to work together, um, to, on a very granular level, consider

732
01:17:03,544 --> 01:17:13,389
[SPEAKER_10]: the table of uses and dimensionals specifically around next use three commercial and how they will affect the overall character and coherence of Mystic app.

733
01:17:13,409 --> 01:17:27,077
[SPEAKER_10]: Unless there are any further questions or motions, I would entertain a motion to put this forward and keep the paper in committee.

734
01:17:30,659 --> 01:17:31,039
[SPEAKER_12]: On my radar.

735
01:17:34,304 --> 01:17:36,226
[SPEAKER_12]: keep the papering committee, refer out the comments.

736
01:17:37,987 --> 01:17:42,531
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I'll just, if you want to take public comment, because I'll just adjourn.

737
01:17:42,871 --> 01:17:43,792
[SPEAKER_10]: I see a hand raise on Zoom.

738
01:17:43,972 --> 01:17:45,393
[SPEAKER_10]: Gaston, I'll unmute you.

739
01:17:45,413 --> 01:17:45,934
[SPEAKER_10]: Please go ahead.

740
01:17:45,974 --> 01:17:47,375
[SPEAKER_10]: Please state your name and address for the record.

741
01:17:47,435 --> 01:17:48,116
[SPEAKER_10]: You have three minutes.

742
01:17:48,176 --> 01:17:48,736
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for waiting.

743
01:17:50,197 --> 01:17:51,499
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much, Madam Chair.

744
01:17:51,619 --> 01:17:53,220
[SPEAKER_00]: Gaston Fiore, 61 Stickney Road.

745
01:17:53,320 --> 01:18:01,327
[SPEAKER_00]: I just quickly wanted to mention that for the industrial area within the commercial, I agreed to keep it flexible.

746
01:18:02,912 --> 01:18:14,622
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would just have the minimum of one floor and then put the height to the, even the maximum height that the, unfortunately the papers weren't sharing the agenda.

747
01:18:14,642 --> 01:18:16,163
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know what the maximum is in that area.

748
01:18:16,203 --> 01:18:17,544
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was eight floors.

749
01:18:18,345 --> 01:18:25,571
[SPEAKER_00]: Copy that, that, I mean, we're not gonna get an aircraft hangar on Mystic Avenue, but industrial facilities need flexibility.

750
01:18:26,594 --> 01:18:36,960
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that the planner mentioned that, yeah, we don't want something kind of like, even if it's one floor, but pretty tall next to a shop that is one floor and not that tall.

751
01:18:36,980 --> 01:18:39,601
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, that's the point of an industrial area.

752
01:18:39,661 --> 01:18:42,783
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that, you know, there's different industries that do different things.

753
01:18:42,923 --> 01:18:45,124
[SPEAKER_00]: Some might manufacture things that need a lot of height.

754
01:18:45,805 --> 01:18:48,726
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would try to keep it as flexible as possible.

755
01:18:49,087 --> 01:18:52,168
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone mentioned from the table that the CEO of that,

756
01:18:53,809 --> 01:19:05,376
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics company mentioned that he came to Medford because there was availability of flexible space, and I think that we don't want a lot of flexibility everywhere, but if we're going to have an industrial zone, I will keep it as flexible as possible.

757
01:19:05,436 --> 01:19:05,937
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.

758
01:19:05,957 --> 01:19:07,498
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate the opportunity to speak.

759
01:19:08,838 --> 01:19:08,958
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

760
01:19:08,998 --> 01:19:10,179
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much, Gaston.

761
01:19:10,219 --> 01:19:15,082
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I think that point about where we want flexibility is really relevant here and very well taken.

762
01:19:17,304 --> 01:19:17,704
[SPEAKER_10]: President Beers?

763
01:19:18,845 --> 01:19:19,145
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks.

764
01:19:19,205 --> 01:19:20,446
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, just I agree too.

765
01:19:22,867 --> 01:19:29,911
[SPEAKER_12]: Motion to report out the questions and comments to the steering committee, keep the paper in committee and adjourn.

766
01:19:32,073 --> 01:19:34,234
[SPEAKER_10]: Great, on the motion by President Behrs.

767
01:19:34,634 --> 01:19:36,615
[SPEAKER_10]: And I understand this is no longer a hybrid meeting.

768
01:19:38,356 --> 01:19:39,037
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

769
01:19:39,657 --> 01:19:40,017
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

770
01:19:40,478 --> 01:19:40,958
[SPEAKER_10]: All opposed?

771
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:42,719
[SPEAKER_10]: Great, thank you all.

772
01:19:43,479 --> 01:19:48,382
[SPEAKER_10]: And thank you, city staff and associates for being with us and guiding us as usual.

773
01:19:48,823 --> 01:19:49,243
[SPEAKER_10]: Meeting adjourned.

774
01:19:52,418 --> 01:19:53,339
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, we have governance.

775
01:20:00,629 --> 01:20:01,470
[SPEAKER_02]: This will be a jam.
