 La reunión está llamada al orden.
 We are also joined by non-voting members of the committee, Councilor Tseng and Councilor Lazzaro.
 The action and discussion items for this committee are again paper 24-033, Zoning Ordinance Updates with the Innes Associates Team.
 The meeting notice writes that we are going to discuss the green score proposal, discussion of housing definitions, and general discussion of updates to the zoning ordinance.
 We're actually not going to be discussing green score proposal tonight.
 We've discussed that in previous meetings.
 The zoning consultant is doing more work on that side of things before we bring it forward to this committee for another public discussion.
 So that is one of many items that is in progress, but we won't be speaking about it this evening.
 For tonight, we are going to focus the conversation on two main discussion points.
 We're going to revisit the housing definitions that were first circulated during the week of September 11.
 I don't remember if that was the date of the meeting or the date that the meeting notice went out, but we have recirculated those housing definitions.
 And since we've discussed them before and Councilors have had several weeks to review, formulate comments and questions,
 I'm hoping that that is a piece that we can consolidate all of our remaining questions, comments, requested subtractions, additions on, and get that to a condition where it's able to report out as part of the incoming package of updates that we've been working on for the past four to six weeks.
 And just to finish summarizing the agenda for tonight,
 We are also going to discuss the zoning proposal for Mystic Ave.
 We've gone over this in great detail in a couple meetings of this committee recently, and we're going to hear some, I think at our most recent meeting was when we reported out, sorry, at our most recent meeting, we approved some recommendations from the zoning consultant on how to move forward with zoning for Mystic Ave.
 And I understand that there are some minor changes, suggestions, additions to what the council, what this committee approved.
 So we're going to review and discuss those this evening.
 And I think we're still planning to have those back in this committee on October 23rd so that we can hopefully report them out and get them on the pipeline where they will then be reviewed by the Community Development Board.
 So I am happy to
 turn it over to my fellow Councilors if they have any initial questions, and then to turn it over to our housing consultant to lead the discussion on the housing definitions.
 Any comments or questions from Councilors to lead us off today?
 Excelente.
 In that case, thank you so much to NS Associates for being here with us once again.
 And Paola, I assume that we're going to be hearing from you.
 These are, again, these are housing definitions that we have seen before and reviewed before.
 So if members of the public are interested in the presentation on the housing definitions, that can be found in recordings of our previous committee meetings.
 Paola, if you want to give us the kind of 30,000 foot overview of what we're looking at here and why these are so important to put into our updated zoning, that would be great.
 And then we'll move on to comment from councilors.</p>
