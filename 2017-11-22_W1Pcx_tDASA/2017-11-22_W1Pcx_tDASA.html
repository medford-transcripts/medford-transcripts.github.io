    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=574.996s">36th</a>  regular meeting of the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=579.398s">November</a>  21st, 2017. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=581.659s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=583.88s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=631.321s">All</a>  in the motion by Councilor Lungo-Koehn for suspension of the rules, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=635.544s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=636.926s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=637.826s">17,</a>  seven, six, five. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=640.949s">Five.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=641.769s">Petition</a>  by Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street, Medford, to address the council on do zoning laws apply in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=650.136s">Good</a>  evening, name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=652.33s">Hi,</a>  Cheryl Rodriguez, 21 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=654.715s">Thanks</a>  for taking me. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=655.937s">I'm</a>  having a little bronchitis, so. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=660.223s">So</a>  I just wanted to start with a notification. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=662.904s">If</a>  you live on or near Bellevue Street, Capon Street, Fairmont Street, University Avenue, or Winthrop Street, please be advised that Tufts University intends to convert these properties there into dormitories. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=673.525s">I</a>  have no further details on this project and have just heard about them. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=678.346s">The</a>  ZBA meeting for their variances is on Monday, December 4th at 7 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=682.407s">here</a>  in Council Chambers. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=684.327s">Unless</a>  you are an abutter or an abutter to an abutter, you will not be notified of this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=691.229s">Sadly,</a>  I'm here again to speak on the gross negligence of our Zoning Board of Appeals with regards to the 87 Medford Street Project. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=698.011s">After</a>  the October 25th meeting, I and another resident filed a complaint with the Attorney General for violation of open meeting laws and not allowing residents to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=707.494s">Two</a>  subsequent complaints were filed after the November 13th meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=712.276s">I</a>  also included in my complaint that our Zoning Board members seem to not understand what their job and limitations are. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=718.918s">They</a>  are not permitted to create new zoning laws on a parcel-by-parcel basis through variances, which is essentially spot zoning, and frankly are not allowed to create new zoning laws at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=729.037s">That</a>  is the job of the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=732.297s">In</a>  the presence of dozens of residents and four sitting city councilors, a member of the ZBA in October stated that the board was forced to grant illegal variances because the Medford City Council has not changed zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=743.723s">That's</a>  not true, and I again ask this council to set the record straight that this is not in their purview. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=749.426s">Variances</a>  should be rare and only under legally allowed conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=754.468s">These</a>  developers time and time again express surprise when they meet resistance to their projects as they say they are being encouraged by the administration to build denser. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=763.477s">This</a>  council needs to find out where that message is coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=766.059s">Is</a>  it the Office of Community Development? <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=767.861s">Whoever</a>  it is, why are they encouraging developers to ignore zoning laws? <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=772.305s">Because</a>  projects with nine plus variances aren't bending zoning laws, they're pretending they don't exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=779.362s">According</a>  to the Medford Zoning Ordinances, Chapter 94, Section 173, entitled General Dimensional Requirements, Table 6.3, titled Table of Dimensional Requirements, this project is so grossly outsized for the property provided that it was illegal for it to have passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=796.682s">A</a>  multi-dwelling, which is as close as this mixed use which is not allowed, requires 10,000 square feet to start, 4,500 square feet for the first two units, then 1,000 square feet for each additional unit on floors one through three, 600 square feet for each unit on floors four and above. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=814.314s">By</a>  this math, the size of the property is about 45,000 square feet and they're only legally permitted to build 32 units as the housing doesn't begin until the second level. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=823.62s">If</a>  the housing began at the first level, they would only be allowed to build 31. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=826.561s">The</a>  project approved was 55. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=830.441s">Let</a>  that sink in. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=831.721s">A</a>  full 23 units over allowable density if this project was legally allowed to be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=837.762s">To</a>  put that into perspective, the developer threatened if this project didn't go through, he would build a 40B there. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=844.163s">I</a>  counted that a 40B might be smaller. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=847.024s">40B</a>  projects would also provide 25% affordable units instead of the six provided here. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=853.045s">but</a>  they are legally allowed to go outside the zoning laws, but likely not as far as this. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=858.209s">Even</a>  though this project is illegal for the sake of argument, even 30% outside of our zoning of 40B would only be 42 units, with at least 10 of those units being affordable, still 13 less than were legally approved by our zoning board. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=872.862s">That</a>  evidence removes all arguments that this is done to increase affordable housing because it adds 49 luxury price units and only six affordable units. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=882.53s">This</a>  is a density project and nothing more. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=885.273s">The</a>  approval of the project was illegal. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=887.355s">It</a>  shows a fundamental lack of understanding of our zoning laws and the boundaries of the powers of the ZBA. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=893.48s">It</a>  also runs contrary to the reasons that they stated for breaking our zoning laws without remorse. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=899.625s">The</a>  entire board should be removed. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=901.367s">The</a>  decision should be immediately overturned. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=903.689s">When</a>  a new board is installed, they should be made to watch the open meeting law tapes the Attorney General ordered the board to watch after their last violation of open meeting law. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=913.279s">They</a>  should also be made to read Massachusetts General Law section 40A, paying particular attention to section 10 entitled variances. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=921.688s">These</a>  are the only way that this board can legally grant variances, not based on a density agenda, not based on the will of the administration, and definitely not because they feel responsible for solving the greater Boston housing crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=937.763s">Yesterday,</a>  the meeting of the open meeting law complaints was held by the ZBA at 8.45 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=943.328s">The</a>  board affirmed that they feel they are fighting against this council for a greater good. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=948.3s">It</a>  was again stated that they are forced to grant variances because this council has an updated zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=954.261s">Further,</a>  it was said that even if this council asks them to expand who they notify for projects, they will refuse to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=962.383s">They</a>  said they will follow the letter of the Massachusetts law and only notify abutters to abutters within 300 feet and only residents directly across the street from the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=973.426s">One</a>  of the complainants was from a resident who was across the street from the project and one house over. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=978.853s">She</a>  complained that she was not notified. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=981.015s">The</a>  ZBA says they are under no obligation to notify her and will not notify people similarly in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=989.105s">This</a>  project will impact her as much as her next door neighbor. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=992.789s">This</a>  was highlighted and they asked Solicitor Rumley to back them in this interpretation of the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=998.993s">This</a>  board has consulted with our city solicitor and has made it clear that they intend to do the minimum and will not do more even if an ordinance is passed by this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1008.98s">The</a>  time has passed to talk here at meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1010.921s">This</a>  is happening and accelerating quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1013.363s">We</a>  have a ZBA that is moving to increase density through variances and refusing to be checked other than through the filing of court cases. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1022.587s">I</a>  asked Solicitor Rumley if there was a board I could appeal to that would help, since the ZBA is going outside of zoning and refusing to follow the laws on granting variances, and he angrily told me to hire an attorney. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1035.371s">Apparently</a>  that is our only recourse. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1037.992s">But</a>  you need to do it quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1039.212s">This</a>  last illegal approval allowed density that was 70% more than what is allowed for a parcel of this size in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1049.888s">It</a>  provides zero setbacks. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1053.39s">Even</a>  if zoning was completely modified tomorrow, it is doubtful that a project like this would have been allowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1060.154s">If</a>  you update zoning to allow more density and the ZBA still feels that it isn't dense enough, we'll stop them from approving projects 70% over what you make in the new laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1072.693s">You've</a>  lost complete control of our zoning laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1075.696s">The</a>  time to play nice is over. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1078.098s">Our</a>  ZBA is doing as they see fit with regard to zoning laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1081.722s">Our</a>  Mayor is meeting with people behind closed doors to write zoning laws the way she wants them to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1087.428s">Where</a>  is the City Council in this conversation? <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1089.93s">Where</a>  is the resident input? <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1092.083s">This</a>  is your area. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1093.204s">This</a>  is under your control. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1095.006s">You</a>  have far more power than to make a speech. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1097.668s">Please</a>  use it. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1098.829s">The</a>  residents are counting on you. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1101.011s">You</a>  saw that the ZBA only allowed you to speak at the Medford Street Project in October. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1106.156s">And</a>  all that you spoke was to say to let the residents speak, which they did not. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1110.54s">You</a>  need to speak for us now. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1112.863s">In</a>  18 months, it will be too late. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1115.545s">You've</a>  all retained your seats. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1117.225s">You</a>  can all start the work now. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1119.386s">I</a>  encourage you to retain an attorney versus loaning laws to help you with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1123.687s">Not</a>  just a group that's charged with increasing density in cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1127.768s">You</a>  need to reign in this board. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1129.548s">You</a>  need to take control. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1131.648s">What</a>  are you going to do about this project? <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1133.529s">It's</a>  now passed and the only way to stop it is to file a lawsuit. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1137.63s">Is</a>  that how it's going to work here in Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1140.473s">Either</a>  you stop gross overreach or the city continues to sue itself over and over again. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1145.006s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Krause]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1155.057s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1155.417s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1156.618s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1156.978s">Yes,</a>  my name is Ken Krause. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1158.78s">I</a>  live at 50 Mystic Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1161.482s">I'm</a>  not speaking on behalf of Tufts University, but I just wanted to share some information for people who might be here or watching about the items that were mentioned coming up on December 4th at the zoning board. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1175.151s">I</a>  saw the public notices in the transcript last week for 13 single-family homes that Tufts intends to <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1183.437s">convert</a>  to housing for upper level students. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1187.881s">Just</a>  for a little bit of background, again, I didn't bring my notes or anything or come prepared to speak on this, but I called the community relations office when I saw that because I was curious as to what that entails. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1197.47s">So</a>  briefly, Tufts requires their freshmen and sophomores to live on campus. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1203.376s">About</a>  50% of the junior students study abroad. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1208.06s">Tufts</a>  has found when those students come back, they don't want to live in conventional dormitories with a bunch of freshman and sophomore type students. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1215.808s">So</a>  they're looking to provide housing for the upper level junior and senior students in another setting that's more typical to apartment living. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1228.065s">Tufts</a>  owns 13 buildings on the streets that were mentioned, Winthrop, Fairmount, I forget the other two names, University Avenue, including a building that houses the Community Relations Office, and they're going to be moved.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1239.37s">I</a>  think they own all but I think three.</p>

    <p>[Krause]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1241.151s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1241.511s">So</a>  they're currently. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1243.532s">wooden</a>  homes on the streets and they're going to remain wooden homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1250.738s">Instead</a>  of being on the open market, Tufts rents them now, they're going to be offered to students through the housing program that they offer their students. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1259.426s">So</a>  I just wanted to share some of that because if people heard they're going to <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1264.75s">change</a>  these streets into dormitories and think there's going to be bulldozing of those streets and all those residents that are there. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1273.498s">That's</a>  not the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1274.659s">I</a>  encourage people to come on December 4th. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1278.602s">The</a>  Community Relations Office indicated they've already spoke to the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1282.285s">They've</a>  spoken to each of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1283.466s">They've</a>  talked to many of the abutters. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1286.649s">Many</a>  of the abutters are absentee landlords and <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1291.984s">Their</a>  situation is different than you might typically anticipate when you encounter neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1301.631s">But</a>  it sounds like they're doing the right thing in terms of the outreach. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1306.715s">And</a>  just in a nutshell, that's what they're planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1308.957s">So</a>  I encourage people to learn more about this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1313.0s">December</a>  4th at 7 o'clock, I believe, is the Zoning Board of Appeals hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1319.185s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1319.485s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Cross.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1321.735s">All</a>  right, any further discussion on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1323.956s">Thank</a>  you, motion to receive and place on file? <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1328.378s">By</a>  Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1330.419s">Motion</a>  by Councilor Dello Russo to receive and place on file, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1334.701s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1335.962s">Sorry?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1337.563s">Councilor</a>  Knight has requested a roll call vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1339.664s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Maryanne Adduci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1379.808s">Marianne</a>  Ducey to Nott Street, Medford.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1382.089s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Maryanne Adduci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1384.293s">There</a>  was a meeting last night of the Green Line. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1387.417s">They're</a>  talking now about Route 16 again. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1393.206s">There</a>  wasn't any public notification of that to abutters for the most part or the adjacent neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1401.566s">I</a>  found out accidentally a neighbor, I don't have a computer, I don't have email. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1407.688s">So</a>  a neighbor started on email but it was conversations between two proponents of this talking about the meeting and the notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1416.73s">So</a>  the neighbor brought it down to me and asked me if I knew about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1419.59s">I</a>  said no. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1420.251s">So</a>  I decided to knock on a few doors to find out if anybody else knew. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1426.252s">Long</a>  and the short of it is I knocked on 150 doors. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1430.683s">Passed</a>  out 90 flyers. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1432.764s">For</a>  the most part, people were not informed. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1436.525s">And</a>  those that were informed found out, as I said, through Facebook or some other communications. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1442.286s">But</a>  most people thought that the Route 16 part was going to be on hold until they finished the College Ave portion. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1450.829s">The</a>  College Ave portion is going to be completed in 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1453.709s">They're</a>  already starting to do some work. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1455.69s">I</a>  don't know if any of you have been down there, but they are doing some work. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1461.503s">I</a>  spoke to the DOT last night, the head of the DOT, and explained this to him. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1467.068s">And</a>  he had said, oh, it was a good turnout tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1469.109s">I</a>  said, yeah, you have me to thank, because I knocked on 150 doors. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1473.553s">So</a>  he was surprised at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1476.696s">So</a>  we got both sides of the picture last night, because usually at these meetings, the proponent group is pretty organized. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1482.54s">And</a>  they call each other and say, show up. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1485.883s">But</a>  the abutters and the elderly people and the people who don't have email and the people who are just not in line with this all or in the communication link, they don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1498.148s">So</a>  this has got to change now. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1500.21s">We've</a>  gone through this in the first phase. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1502.592s">There</a>  was a lot of this non-notification. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1504.234s">In</a>  fact, I have a letter that I wrote in 2012 complaining about this very same issue, which you can have a copy of, which substantiates that this is a pattern. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1516.025s">They</a>  kind of like have a subculture. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1519.267s">They,</a>  you know, they speak amongst themselves, but the ones who are most directly infected are out of the loop. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1524.229s">And</a>  we're afraid that by the time we find out about it, it's going to be too late to make any changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1528.511s">It</a>  may be already too late to make any changes, but we should have some input before this thing goes too far. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1533.693s">Let</a>  me see here. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1540.892s">Oh,</a>  the neighbor that informed me called the Boston Globe, the Medford Transcript, neither of them had any kind of public notice posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1549.003s">I</a>  called a few of the city councilors who recommended that I come tonight, which I'm here. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1556.873s">at</a>  City Hall here, got a reverse 911 call. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1561.774s">So</a>  a reverse 911 went out Saturday night, although it was only two days before the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1567.856s">So</a>  if you had plans, you know, you were out of luck. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1571.496s">Also,</a>  I didn't like the idea that they scheduled this meeting on Thanksgiving week. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1576.458s">Even</a>  if you knew about it, people are busy. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1578.878s">And</a>  the response period, the comment period, is right after Thanksgiving. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1583.359s">Again,</a>  people are busy over the holidays. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1585.02s">They</a>  haven't got time to deal with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1586.94s">So</a>  it's from past history and what they're doing now again, it's suppressing comments because they don't give people enough time to find out about this stuff and to send their comments in. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1601.709s">I</a>  don't know if all of you are aware what the plans were in the past, but about five or six years ago, <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1608.12s">The</a>  Metropolitan Planning Council came out and gave a presentation to the group. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1612.885s">And</a>  basically, they want to do economic development around the station. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1619.211s">The</a>  station is going to be sited somewhere in the vicinity of the U-Haul building. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1623.335s">Now,</a>  that's summable. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1625.717s">So</a>  any economic development that happens there, summable is going to get the benefit of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1631.482s">So</a>  the Metropolitan Planning Council said, well, maybe they could do some development in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1635.864s">They</a>  had suggested putting a row of retail stores along Auburn Street, where Whole Foods is now. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1641.467s">But</a>  if they do that, that's going to take away from Whole Foods parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1645.108s">So</a>  what would they do there? <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1646.409s">Would</a>  they put a parking garage up? <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1648.71s">Then</a>  they suggested, well, you could probably put condo development where Walkwing Court is. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1655.294s">Not</a>  very high, maybe four or six stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1657.895s">But</a>  when they built Walkwing Court, they built it specifically to be two stories high because they wanted it to blend in with the surrounding neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1667.496s">Plus,</a>  it would be displacing all those seniors and disabled people that live there now because they said that this would not be for seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1675.163s">This</a>  wasn't going to be a senior complex. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1677.084s">It</a>  would be for, you know, the regular public. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1680.007s">So,</a>  I just can't, you know, cope with that because, I mean, you know, we don't need that there. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1686.372s">I</a>  mean, you're going to displace seniors who like living there. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1693.913s">They</a>  wanted to site this station at Route 16, and the whole purpose of this transit here is because they hope to take cars off the road and get people onto transit. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1706.488s">However,</a>  if you put a station at Route 16, if any of you have traveled Route 16, any time of the day, a lot of traffic, always a lot of traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1715.211s">But</a>  it's not traffic coming to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1717.371s">It's</a>  pass-through traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1718.492s">It's</a>  traffic going to 93, it's going to Route 2, it's going to 28, it's going to 3. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1724.934s">So</a>  if you put a station there, that's not going to alleviate any of the Route 16 traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1730.99s">Matter</a>  of fact, it may bring more traffic if people come to the station that wouldn't ordinarily come here. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1736.613s">Plus,</a>  we have ample public transportation in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1740.755s">We</a>  have a bus that goes to Lechmere, which may get taken off if they put the station here. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1748.438s">And</a>  they may say, you can get on the Lechmere line at either College Ave or Route 16. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1754.321s">Plus,</a>  we have Davis Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1756.382s">We</a>  have Harvard Square buses. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1758.423s">We</a>  have the commuter rail. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1760.598s">And,</a>  you know, it's a short walk to Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1762.64s">You</a>  can get on other buses that go to Wellington and other places. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1766.023s">So</a>  it's not like we have no transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1769.547s">Plus</a>  the cost of doing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1771.128s">We're</a>  talking about, they say a mile. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1773.15s">I</a>  think that's the way, you know, if you measured it with a tape measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1775.853s">But</a>  people, like where I live on North Street, I can walk, to call it jab, in about 15 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1782.9s">And</a>  I'm a senior citizen. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1784.791s">So</a>  younger people got much faster than I. If you're going to come to Route 16 station with a bicycle, so you pedal a couple of more minutes and you get to College Ave, no big deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1796.54s">This</a>  is going to require rebuilding the North Street Bridge and the Winthrop Street Bridge because they're not high enough or wide enough underneath for the two sets of trains to go under. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1807.889s">The</a>  North Street Bridge right now is very steep. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1811.639s">I</a>  was standing outside the polling place at Walkwing Court on election day. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1816.34s">A</a>  guy came by with a baby carriage. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1818.281s">And</a>  I was asking him if he knew about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1820.182s">And</a>  he said, no, he didn't know about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1821.582s">And</a>  he said, I told him they have to rebuild this bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1824.083s">And</a>  he says, I can't even push the baby carriage up the bridge now. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1827.044s">Another</a>  guy came by on a bicycle. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1829.144s">I</a>  told him, he says, I have trouble pedaling up the hill now. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1832.605s">And</a>  not to speak of the people who have to walk up the hill. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1835.75s">So</a>  I don't know if it's going to be higher or what. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1841.011s">And</a>  living in the neighborhood, when they rebuilt those two bridges, it wasn't all that long ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1847.033s">It</a>  was a terrible inconvenience because all the streets around there have been made one way. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1852.654s">So</a>  the only way to exit from where I live would be in front of Whole Foods onto Route 16. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1858.415s">So</a>  you're putting more traffic onto Route 16 because you're closing the bridges. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1862.196s">I</a>  know it's only a temporary couple of years until they fix the bridge, but still. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1869.661s">So</a>  when you add up the cost of all this, can you cost justify that the expense that it's going to cost to put one more station at Route 16, that some of those are going to get the benefit of it, and the method's going to get the pain of it? <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1885.677s">It's</a>  not gonna help us. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1887.098s">Now</a>  I know the mayor comes in various public meetings and she says she's all for it, but I'd like to know what's in it for Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1896.524s">Why</a>  is she so for it? <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1898.165s">We</a>  have to find that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1902.308s">The</a>  city mayor, you people, you have to have a listening session or a meeting with just the abutters and just the people in the immediate area to hear their concerns, <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1914.978s">to</a>  look at their neighborhood, I would be happy to take all of you people on a little tour so you can see what, I mean, you know, it's one thing seeing it on paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1924.307s">It's</a>  another thing walking the route and see what we're talking about here. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1928.831s">I</a>  would, if the mayor's listening, you can come too. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1931.614s">You</a>  probably, you should benefit from this. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1936.563s">So,</a>  and premature, I think it's premature. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1940.927s">Finish</a>  college ed, you'll learn a lot probably if you finish college ed before you even consider Route 16, whether you want it or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1950.834s">So,</a>  I know the proponents of this are very enthusiastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1954.277s">It's</a>  not that I'm against public transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1957.079s">I'm</a>  for public transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1959.441s">When</a>  it's justified, when it's cost effective, when it's going to be beneficial, <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1964.763s">If</a>  it's going to do some good for the city, fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1968.044s">But</a>  I just, I mean, you just can't see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1971.745s">The</a>  city has to hear the other side of the story and pay attention, not shut us out of this whole process. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1979.248s">Because</a>  we've been shut out for the whole project, you might as well say. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1983.79s">So</a>  basically, that's really all I want to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=1989.031s">I</a>  mean, if you have any questions, I can give you the past history.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2025.537s">to</a>  express your dissatisfaction with the notification policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2031.619s">I</a>  find it very frustrating myself when the neighborhood isn't notified of such an important meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2039.001s">And</a>  it's something that goes on. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2042.462s">with</a>  a number of different things in this city, and it's unfortunate. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2045.265s">I</a>  don't know if that's the MBTA, but I think that the city, knowing of such a meeting, should have done a reverse 911 call.</p>

    <p>[Maryanne Adduci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2051.331s">Well,</a>  they did at the very end, but I think that was prompted by some conversation I had with one of the councilors here.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2058.327s">Right,</a>  and I think the comment period, like you mentioned, I believe the comment period on this is by Tuesday, November 28th at 5 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2067.069s">So,</a>  I mean, my first recommendation would be to reach out to the MBTA and ask them to extend that. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2073.19s">That's</a>  basically comments are due immediately after, you know, the Thanksgiving holiday when a lot of people are away.</p>

    <p>[Maryanne Adduci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2080.811s">He</a>  didn't feel, last night he was just emphatically saying that that's the deadline, so he was, you know.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2087.957s">I'd</a>  like to take a vote tonight and just request that that be extended by another week or two. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2092.039s">I</a>  don't think it hurts to allow public comment, whether you're for or against the extension. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2096.921s">I</a>  think public comment should be given a more extensive period of time to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2103.324s">And</a>  I think a meeting with the abutters, whether the city council holds it or the mayor, I believe that we do need to know what the positives and negatives are, and we need to know the concerns so that we can help address them with the MBTA. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2116.67s">So</a>  those are just two things I wanted to add. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2119.512s">I</a>  think we should vote on. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2121.272s">We</a>  want to make a request that the city holds a public hearing or a public meeting.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2128.816s">And</a>  extend the comment period? <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2130.757s">Yes,</a>  please. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2131.337s">Mr.</a>  Clark, do you have that? <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2133.198s">The</a>  MBTA or the City of Medford.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2136.66s">The</a>  MBTA or the City of Medford.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2138.461s">And</a>  the City of Medford hold a public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2146.045s">Public</a>  meeting, excuse me, public meeting.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2150.05s">We</a>  want to hold a public meeting, that's one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2151.712s">And</a>  then, Clerk Finn, we want to also ask that they extend the comment period by a week or two past the Tuesday, November 28 date that was written on the notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2163.625s">People</a>  have to comment to the Secretary of Energy and Environment Affairs, MEPA office, no later than 5 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2171.048s">on</a>  Tuesday, November 28th. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2172.848s">Can</a>  we request that that time period be extended, especially for those who just learned about this project during either the reverse 911 call or when you notified them by knocking on doors?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2184.793s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2186.662s">On</a>  the motion, Micah.</p>

    <p>[Maryanne Adduci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2188.704s">Do</a>  you want a copy of this 2012, whatever I wrote? <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2192.327s">Because</a>  it documents this to show you people that it's not a new problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2197.392s">I</a>  documented it in here that was lack of notification. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2199.894s">So</a>  it's an ongoing problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2201.776s">It</a>  goes back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2204.118s">Sometimes</a>  they invite you, sometimes they don't.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2207.662s">If</a>  you'd like to give it to the messenger and he'll give it to the clerk to send along. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2212.224s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2212.885s">I</a>  think just to close, I think we've all one time or another have voiced our frustration with this reverse 911 system. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2220.848s">We</a>  get notifications multiple times about <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2225.21s">fund</a>  community events, which is great, but when you have such a serious meeting with regards to the MBTA or our last speaker who spoke about notification about zoning meetings, zoning board of appeals meetings, and nobody's getting notified, and we're not using that reverse 9-1-1 system, it's extremely frustrating. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2247.074s">This</a>  is just, I'm hearing it far too often from residents who should be the ones controlling the situations, controlling and having their voices heard, controlling development, controlling a number of different things in the city and we're not notifying them of important public information a neighborhood should know about.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2269.863s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2276.88s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2277.26s">Name</a>  and address to the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Anita Nagem]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2278.821s">My</a>  name is Anita Nagum. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2280.102s">I</a>  live on Norton Avenue in Medford, just off of North Street, near Walkland Court. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2284.984s">There</a>  are a couple of things I would like to add to what Mary Ann has just said. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2288.866s">First,</a>  as far as the notification, well, first let me start. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2293.088s">I</a>  contacted the Green Line Extension Project at MassDOT and asked that the comment period be extended. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2302.3s">It</a>  took a week for someone to call me back. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2305.301s">I</a>  explained to him that abutters had not been notified. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2308.561s">And</a>  we are talking about people on Charnwood Orchard and Piggott who would actually have property taken, not to mention people as far away as I am, which is about 150 yards, who are legally considered abutters as well under, I believe, federal statute. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2324.584s">He</a>  said he'd get back to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2325.564s">He</a>  never did. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2326.104s">I</a>  put two requests or comments into the governor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2331.041s">asking</a>  that this comment period be extended and I still have not received any response to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2337.285s">Concerning</a>  notification to residents, the MassDOT used an email list which was obtained from 2009 to 2015 about when the previous series of meetings was held. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2353.494s">People</a>  came in and voluntarily signed in on sheets. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2357.416s">If</a>  they put email addresses down, <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2361.601s">that</a>  information was given to MassDOT and that was used to provide the only notification for this last meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2370.625s">Previously,</a>  MassDOT, actually because they were trying to get federal funding, went and put flyers around <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2379.726s">if</a>  not by mail, but I believe they usually went and actually put flyers on the houses of abutters to notify them of meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2387.77s">I,</a>  at the meeting yesterday, challenged them on their lack of notification, and the response was, well, we sent out an email that is completely unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2399.835s">The</a>  reverse 911 is fine, but that was done by the city of Medford, not the state, and it was only done because Mary Ann happened to call. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2409.209s">and</a>  speak with one of the city councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2411.81s">In</a>  addition, that is not sufficient. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2413.631s">A</a>  lot of people, because of the overuse of the 9-1-1, reverse 9-1-1, have opted out. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2421.114s">Many</a>  people who have cell phones have never even opted in to begin with. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2424.756s">There</a>  are many elderly residents who do not have email and would not know about this unless they were directly notified. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2431.639s">The</a>  notification is unacceptable, and we need the city council to <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2437.036s">advocate</a>  for us with MassDOT to get adequate notification about these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2445.818s">The</a>  situation is really unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2448.739s">The</a>  third thing just about the general project is a federal environmental review was only done for the station up to College Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2457.701s">A</a>  federal environmental review was never done for the Route 16 station, and it was dropped before one was ever done, was done. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2466.552s">The</a>  MassDOT MBTA has filed a notice of project change, which would allow them to add the Route 16 station without a federal environmental review. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2476.495s">NEPA,</a>  National Environmental Protection Agency policy, is much more rigorous than the Massachusetts policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2484.858s">And</a>  I would hope that the city council would advocate on behalf of residents to require that <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2493.072s">a</a>  review be done under NEPA national standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2498.697s">This</a>  is a backdoor way to try to get the project in without a federal review. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2503.982s">Because</a>  they're not asking for a federal review, they would not be eligible for federal funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2509.006s">And</a>  if they ever wanted federal funding, they'd have to go back. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2511.528s">But</a>  that ought to be done at the beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2513.63s">It's</a>  really not acceptable to be doing this in this manner.</p>

    <p>[Doug Carr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2538.287s">Yes,</a>  Doug Carr, 124 Boston Avenue, West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2542.429s">I</a>  was at the Green Line meeting as well last night. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2546.683s">I</a>  agree with the preceding folks about the lack of communication about this meeting, but honestly, this is a symptom of a larger problem that Medford has had for a long time, which is a consistent lack of competent planning in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2563.84s">We</a>  do not have enough people. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2565.302s">There</a>  is nobody in this building whose job it is to shepherd the green line. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2570.648s">through</a>  the process, through the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2573.032s">There</a>  hasn't been, for 14 years, we have basically been on the sidelines observing what the state does, not really participating in the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2584.345s">If</a>  we had that, we would have more notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2587.268s">The</a>  state can do some things. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2589.431s">The</a>  city can do some things. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2590.352s">But</a>  the city of Medford really needs to participate in the process, not observe it from the sidelines, which they've been doing now for over a decade. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2598.381s">And</a>  that's where a lot of this misinformation comes from. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2601.825s">And</a>  we're at the frustration level, which I agree with, even though I obviously support the green line and have all the way to 16, because I think it does benefit more people in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2611.568s">It</a>  does benefit West Medford, which is still a mile away from College Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2615.149s">It</a>  benefits a lot of people who cannot walk that far. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2619.89s">The</a>  green line going to College Ave, basically, it just touches the hillside, and it's mostly South Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2624.754s">But</a>  it's dramatically a larger part of Medford that would benefit from Route 16. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2630.238s">And</a>  this is the beginning of putting this project back into the larger project. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2634.221s">It's</a>  a long way to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2635.102s">It's</a>  not like we have a design yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2637.064s">They're</a>  just studying it. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2638.625s">So</a>  I do urge. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2640.386s">all</a>  the people from North Street and every other street around there to get on the mailing list and I concur that the City of Medford needs to do more. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2650.438s">You</a>  really need to hire two or three more planners full time. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2654.743s">It's</a>  like you have <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2656.905s">Somerville</a>  has seven full-time planners. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2658.466s">We</a>  have one. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2659.827s">We've</a>  added thousands of apartments in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2662.969s">The</a>  Green Line, all these planning things that didn't exist 20 years ago, but we have the exact same size OCD we had 20 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2670.052s">That</a>  is a fundamental structural imbalance in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2674.955s">It's</a>  like having a third number of the police or fire that we have that we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2678.997s">Nobody</a>  would accept that, or teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2680.639s">Why</a>  would we accept the same thing for planning? <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2683.562s">And</a>  look at the pattern that's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2685.544s">The</a>  Medford Square master plan sits for 10 years, not executed. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2688.667s">You</a>  have zoning problems, not executed. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2690.889s">You</a>  have green line problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2692.05s">The</a>  thread that ties them together <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2694.993s">is</a>  planning and the lack thereof. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2697.735s">And</a>  until you get more bodies in here, not volunteers, legitimate planners full-time to accent what we already have upstairs with Lauren D'Alenzo and Clodagh and the other people who are good people, they need more help. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2709.763s">And</a>  I know you guys have been working on that, but it's not fast enough and the city is getting overrun by proposals. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2715.748s">So</a>  we need more bodies. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2717.169s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2717.809s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2718.63s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2719.991s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2722.393s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2727.699s">Oh,</a>  I'm sorry.</p>

    <p>[Krause]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2732.663s">Good</a>  evening, name and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2734.044s">Thank</a>  you, Ken Crouse, 50 Mystic Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2736.885s">I</a>  agree with Mary Ann. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2738.586s">We</a>  can't do enough as a city, as the MBTA, as a community, to engage people and provide more notification for these meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2747.131s">They're</a>  very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2748.251s">And</a>  the more people that participate, the better. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2751.153s">A</a>  couple of things I just wanted to clarify, as someone who has been closely involved with the project since 2004, and one, <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2761.26s">The</a>  Walklane Court situation would, anything that would happen to Walklane Court would be decided by the Medford Housing Authority and they control that property. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2768.802s">And</a>  frankly, one of the largest beneficiaries of the Green Line extension will be the people who live at Walklane Court because, especially people with limited mobility. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2780.585s">The</a>  buses that we say we have are very difficult to get on board if you happen to be disabled. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2787.567s">Our</a>  commuter rail system is completely inaccessible. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2790.49s">If</a>  you're disabled, you can't use it at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2793.453s">The</a>  buses run very infrequently. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2795.715s">The</a>  trains run very infrequently. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2797.297s">The</a>  Green Line cars will be level boarding that will run every seven minutes or so. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2803.103s">will</a>  provide an unbelievably improved service to the people at Waukling Court. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2810.489s">And</a>  if anything, this project will leverage our opportunity to get funding to improve Waukling Court and expand it and bring it up to today's standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2821.058s">The</a>  other thing that I want to clarify in terms of historical thing that keeps being mentioned, it was mentioned last night and also today. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2827.723s">that</a>  there was some sort of attempt to circumvent the environmental review process on the national level. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2836.612s">This</a>  project was part of the draft environmental impact report, the Route 16 station in 2009. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2843.9s">When</a>  that was completed, the MBTA, MassDOT said, we're not going to be able to include this station in the first phase of the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2852.925s">So</a>  that environmental review will proceed up to College Avenue through NEPA, the National Environmental Policy Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2862.871s">The</a>  final environmental assessment was done. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2866.613s">But</a>  at that point, it was stated explicitly <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2870.515s">by</a>  the Secretary of Environmental Affairs on January 15th, 2010, and I'll quote Secretary Bowles, as it is not anticipated that construction of the Medford Hillside to Mystic Valley Parkway Route 16 segment will commence within the applicable MEPA or NEPA timeframes, reassessment of alternative two will be required in the form of a notice of project change. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2897.346s">That's</a>  exactly what the MBTA is doing, as they were directed seven years ago by the Secretary. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2904.611s">This</a>  is the initial step in the environmental review, which will probably take about a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2910.575s">So</a>  again, I encourage everybody to get involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2915.158s">There</a>  was a great give and take last night of people from all angles on the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2921.142s">It</a>  was a great start to this process, and I hope people will continue to be engaged <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2926.405s">Throughout,</a>  but I just wanted to clarify that in terms of how the process is being undertaken It's a poor it's it's totally by the book. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2935.435s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2935.815s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2936.075s">Mr.</a>  Gross</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2938.553s">I</a>  just wanted to conclude. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2941.974s">I</a>  agree with, thank you for the comments of Ken and Doug Carr, and I agree with Mr. Carr with regards to the lack of planners. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2949.517s">I</a>  think we've all spoke at budget time to request additional personnel in that department. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2954.599s">We</a>  were lucky to get a traffic engineer, but nobody in the planning department. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2960.161s">The</a>  bottom line is, with regards to just the notification, that is something that you don't even need another planner for. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2966.824s">Notification</a>  and sending out a reverse 911 call should be a given when it comes to such an impactful neighborhood concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2975.569s">And</a>  for a city councilor to have to beg for a reverse 911 call to go out to a very large section of the city that's going to be impacted by the Green Line to let them know of a very important meeting, <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=2988.695s">is</a>  a problem and it's an extremely large problem that's been going on for some time that needs to be fixed and hopefully that will be now that election time's over and we can stop being, not only saying we're transparent, but actually being transparent.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3003.105s">Vice</a>  President Box. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3005.447s">Thank</a>  you Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3008.04s">You</a>  know, this is, as we heard from residents tonight, that this is a common theme. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3014.024s">You</a>  know, not too long ago, we heard about the Grove Street water project that's going on, and the lack of notification for abutters on Grove Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3023.931s">Tonight,</a>  we discussed, and we're going to discuss it further, the Winthrop Street Eversource project, which, again, I'm sure will be concerned with the lack of notification, and the gas line on Harvard. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3036.559s">uh,</a>  that we discussed just recently when about has had to come up and say they never received any notification. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3042.741s">Um,</a>  you know, I think we're going down a real slippery slope when we keep on relying on reverse 911 to be the notification system for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3052.272s">The</a>  9-1-1 was never intended to be the civic engagement of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3058.814s">It</a>  was always intended to be there for emergency purposes. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3063.176s">You</a>  get a reverse 9-1-1 call, think about it, 9-1-1. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3067.513s">It</a>  shouldn't be telling you about a soccer game going on down the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3071.654s">That's</a>  not what the intent of 9-1-1 is. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3074.855s">And</a>  if you look at surrounding communities, and the City of Somerville has a great program, it's called Resistat Program, and they have a system of sending out weekly email notifications to residents that sign up. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3090.118s">And</a>  those notifications talk directly about projects that are going on in the city, timelines, events that are happening, additional information. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3099.16s">This</a>  is where people get their information from, not reverse 911 calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3104.182s">That's</a>  not the way it should happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3106.102s">So</a>  again, Mr. President, because of the lack of notification in this community, if I hear one more time that, oh, we follow state law, within 300 feet, we notify Director Butters. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3118.685s">Is</a>  that a way to operate a city? <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3120.906s">Is</a>  that a way to talk about a project like the Green Line and say we're only going to notify these 40 people that live within 300 feet of this particular area? <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3130.43s">Or</a>  the water project that's happening on Grove Street that impacts the whole neighborhood? <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3135.672s">How</a>  do you just notify people within 300 feet? <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3138.693s">That</a>  may be the state requirement, but it doesn't need to be our requirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3143.695s">our</a>  requirement should be full notification of the city and I think the city of Somerville addresses it appropriately with this Resistat program that notifies residents, you sign up for a newsletter, they hold regular community meetings to discuss and gather input from residents and we do a lot of that in this community too but the community outreach in Somerville to me is a perfect way <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3168.181s">of</a>  reaching out to residents, and not everyone's on email, and I can appreciate that, that everyone doesn't have email, but it's an attempt to reach a broader spectrum than just, oh, state law requires us to notify Director Butters within 300 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3183.886s">That's</a>  not adequate in a city this size, and we hear week after week after week the concerns of residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3190.028s">So</a>  I would ask, Mr. President, that this city administration look into another <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3195.67s">way</a>  of communicating and engaging people in the public process in this community other than reverse 9-1-1. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3205.519s">That's</a>  a great asset and it should be used for emergencies. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3209.082s">But</a>  look into another program that could alert residents on things that are happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3214.406s">If</a>  you're not interested, you don't sign up for the <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3219.53s">the</a>  weekly emails that go out, the newsletters. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3224.972s">But</a>  if you are interested, Mr. President, it's a great way of letting abutters and residents of this community know what's going on, timelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3233.714s">How</a>  many times do you hear from people saying, jeez, you know, we heard that this project's starting, when does it end? <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3239.155s">Is</a>  it going to go through the holiday period? <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3241.315s">When's</a>  it going to end? <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3242.396s">Where</a>  are we going to park? <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3243.216s">Where</a>  are they going to stage the equipment? <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3244.956s">This</a>  should all be in a newsletter and things that people can read readily available and not through just a random 911 call or a random meeting that people may or may not be able to attend on a five o'clock on a Tuesday night here at City Hall or wherever the meeting might be, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3262.08s">So</a>  I would respectfully ask my colleagues <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3264.7s">Mr.</a>  President, to send a recommendation to the city administration to mimic a program similar to what they do in Somerville called the Resistat program, which provides ample notification to residents via news email letters.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3279.567s">You</a>  want to add it onto this, correct?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3281.528s">Yes,</a>  yes, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3282.729s">I</a>  know that was one of Council Lungo's recommendations regarding notification. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3288.411s">So</a>  I would ask that we amend it, Mr. President, to address the very serious issues that we hear week after week. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3295.694s">If</a>  this was an isolated incident, I wouldn't bother. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3298.815s">But</a>  week after week, I think we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3300.856s">And</a>  you heard from many of the residents that got up. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3304.818s">One</a>  of the biggest, I think, drawbacks in this community is the lack of notification. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3310.736s">Even</a>  with the zoning board meetings, you know, we hear about this that show up and say, I'm not opposed to this five-story building, but I am opposed to the fact that I had to find a crumpled up piece of paper in the middle of the street that alerted, you're supposed to alert me to a meeting that was taking place that impacts my neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3327.941s">So</a>  I think those are the issues, Mr. President, and I would ask that that be done in a roll call vote as a form. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3333.803s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_24]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3340.947s">Mr.,</a>  are you requesting a roll call vote, Councilor Marks?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3345.189s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_24]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3346.429s">I</a>  further amend the paper and just ask that copies of the request to the MBTA go to a state delegation as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3352.712s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, if you can amend the paper that the papers go to the state delegation as well.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3356.894s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3359.255s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo.</p>

    <p>[Krause]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3361.136s">Some</a>  members of the attending audience wish to address this matter further.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3367.295s">Mr.</a>  Duchoux, do you want to speak again? <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3368.775s">Before</a>  the roll call is taken.</p>

    <p>[Maryanne Adduci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3370.716s">Just</a>  one point of clarification for Mr. Krause about Walkling Court. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3375.517s">The</a>  problem with Walkling Court is that the commuter rail train is going to be moved closer to the buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3383.218s">And</a>  right now, between the edge of the building and the fence where the track is, there's only the width of a fire lane. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3394.976s">So</a>  if that fence has to come in onto the fire lane, that can't be. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3401.178s">There</a>  has to be a fire lane there. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3402.978s">So</a>  that's what puts Walkman Court in jeopardy. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3406.44s">So</a>  I just wanted to clarify that.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3407.8s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3408.54s">Thank</a>  you, Mrs. Dutcher. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3411.721s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3412.121s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3416.923s">Welcome</a>  back.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3418.713s">Welcome</a>  to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3419.934s">Nice</a>  to see all the city councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3421.775s">Congratulations.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3423.657s">You're</a>  all back in your respective seats. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3425.899s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3426.319s">The</a>  gang of seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3428.08s">And</a>  I'd like to also congratulate the first mayor in the Oval Office. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3434.125s">And</a>  more importantly, I'd like to thank all the challengers that ran with their ideas and foresight to hopefully help city government improve society. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3448.476s">If</a>  I may, I'd like to commend them big time. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3452.617s">Back</a>  to the subject of the Green Line, Mariana Ducci brought up some good points, especially the advertisement. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3465.199s">I</a>  would think, I'm old school, it should be in the method non-script, I mean the transcript, at least one week prior. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3479.047s">not</a>  two days prior. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3482.908s">Also,</a>  I believe Mary Ann made some noise about this green line extending from College Ave, Tufts University, westward to uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3500.263s">Route</a>  16 and Boston Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3502.865s">That</a>  seems kind of redundant to me, the way I think, because that's at the doorstep of West Medford Square, and they already have a commuter line that goes to Boston, and it also goes right through Winchester, and that's above ground, mind you, with the freight trains also, at all hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3527.604s">On</a>  the other side, the east side of our city, Malton Center, has the Orange Line. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3533.909s">I</a>  would think common sense would dictate many years ago, from college out, they should put an underground tunnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3550.287s">without</a>  doing any eminent domain to speak of, and have it emerge in the Medford Square subway station right behind you, Councilor, President, and take that one building by eminent domain, the red brick building, you could put down a piece of grass, you could call it the Medford Commons, and you would have the eternal stimulus, economically speaking, for all times. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3580.325s">Okay,</a>  cost extra, cost more underground. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3583.866s">I've</a>  talked to the union reps that dig these tunnels. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3588.408s">Maybe</a>  if Tufts really wants their station, maybe with $7 billion in the bank, they could put up some cash in a form of a bond. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3599.772s">They</a>  get their Green Line station, and when it's completed, maybe they would volunteer their funds to dig the tunnel underground. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3609.957s">Again,</a>  we are five miles north of Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3613.539s">Route</a>  93 is right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3614.96s">I</a>  don't understand, in my opinion, the lack of common sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3621.184s">And</a>  we should turn our back towards the river and not away from the river. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3625.166s">This</a>  could be the most happening place all of the North Shore, in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3630.11s">Thank</a>  you for listening.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3630.91s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Castagnetti. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3632.691s">On</a>  the motion, if I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3635.82s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3636.2s">Name</a>  and address of the record please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_44]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3637.562s">My</a>  name is Rita Donnelly and I live at 35 Charnwood Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3640.945s">I'm</a>  a direct abutter to the tracks. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3643.687s">I</a>  did get an email because in 2009 I did get on the email list. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3648.832s">I</a>  appreciate what Councilor Knight said about contacting our state reps. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3655.318s">Our</a>  state reps are Senator Jalen and Representative Barber. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3661.108s">They</a>  are for this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3663.209s">They</a>  do not care about the Director Butters. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3665.689s">We</a>  are a small constituency to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3669.59s">They</a>  are going to do whatever Somerville wants. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3672.051s">I</a>  have also spoken to the Mayor and asked her to look at our neighborhood and the changes that will take place in our neighborhood and how you will drive people who have lived in this city for years out. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3688.222s">I</a>  am directly affected. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3689.383s">The</a>  commuter rail will come towards me. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3692.344s">I</a>  haven't decided what I'm going to do, but the diesel particulates, MEPA has said that they are a carcinogen. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3700.988s">They</a>  cause asthma, COPD, lung cancer. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3705.95s">I've</a>  lived there for 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3707.251s">When</a>  I bought my house, I didn't know about diesel particulates. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3710.314s">I</a>  do not understand how you can move a known carcinogen closer to the public for a mile of track. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3720.601s">College</a>  Ave, the railway is wide enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3723.644s">It</a>  narrows as you go from College Ave to Route 16. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3726.746s">They</a>  don't want you to call it Route 16 because Route 16 is so busy. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3730.589s">It</a>  is now the Mystic Valley Parkway. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3733.462s">because</a>  who refers to it as the Mystic Valley Parkway? <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3737.628s">It</a>  sounds like a beautiful drive, doesn't it? <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3740.853s">So</a>  I would hope. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3743.087s">that</a>  this council will keep the neighborhood and the residents that are directly impacted by this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3751.433s">If</a>  it has to go to the Mystic Valley Parkway, it has to go, but it has to go safely and without impact to the residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3759.698s">I</a>  have several new neighbors that have moved into the neighborhood with small children. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3767.023s">They</a>  bought the tracks. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3768.804s">They</a>  didn't know about the diesel particulates and they were not notified to come to the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3775.248s">So</a>  it's a sad situation when people have lived in this city and supported this city and been a part of this community and their voices are not heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3785.015s">There's</a>  a select few that are for the Green Line extension. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3790.908s">And</a>  they are a group. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3792.45s">And</a>  they talk amongst themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3793.771s">And</a>  they seem to have unlimited time to talk about it and to push the representatives and the mayor forward on this project without any consideration to the people that actually live there. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3807.044s">And</a>  it's not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3808.045s">I</a>  don't have a voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3810.192s">I</a>  did try several years ago to talk to Senator Jalen about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3814.837s">She</a>  looked over my head to see who she could find to talk to. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3819.561s">That</a>  is wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3821.463s">When</a>  I spoke to Carl Scortino, he was on the opposite side of me. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3826.047s">He</a>  had an intelligent conversation with me, he explained things to me, I felt better about <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3832.413s">The</a>  Green Line extension, at least my voice was heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3834.895s">I</a>  do not feel like my voice is being heard today. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3838.178s">And</a>  it's unfair and unfortunate. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3839.999s">And</a>  I love Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3841.721s">I've</a>  lived here a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3844.063s">And</a>  it's just not right, the way that things are done behind people's backs. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3850.007s">And</a>  the people that are directly affected are not notified. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3855.532s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3856.272s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Anita Nagem]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3861.119s">Anita</a>  Nagum, 9 Norton Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3863.501s">I</a>  would just like to follow up quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3865.422s">First,</a>  I addressed this specific issue last night at the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3868.464s">The</a>  state currently has no plans to do a review under NEPA policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3874.368s">If</a>  at some point in the future they decide to seek federal funding, they would do one, but right now it will only be done under NEPA Massachusetts policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3883.727s">Second,</a>  I just want to say I am very much in favor of public transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3887.908s">I</a>  bought my house in Medford Hillside 28 years ago because it was very well served by public transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3897.21s">We</a>  didn't have a car for 10 years, and we used the MBTA almost exclusively, except for times when we have large loads to carry. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3904.451s">I</a>  also worked with the MBTA, and at my suggestion, because I used to live in Winter Hill and go to Cambridge, <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3912.202s">The</a>  only way at that time to get to Cambridge from Winter Hill was to go to Sullivan Square, into the city, and come back out. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3920.968s">It's</a>  not a great solution, but what they came up with was running the 89 bus that runs from Sullivan Square to Clarendon Hill. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3929.834s">Every</a>  other bus now goes to Davis Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3933.577s">So</a>  I just want to say I'm very much in favor of public transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3939.773s">This</a>  project is not cost effective. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3942.535s">It</a>  is not going to improve transportation for the residents of Medford Hillside. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3947.86s">My</a>  husband teaches at Boston University. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3950.042s">He</a>  takes the Green Line. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3951.723s">I</a>  have timed how long it takes to go from Lechmere to Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3955.266s">It</a>  was 14 minutes off peak. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3957.268s">And</a>  you might be able to reduce that a minute or two. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3962.563s">Even</a>  if this comes all the way out to Medford Hillside and it's two minutes from our house, it would still be faster for him to go to Davis Square, get on the red line, and get on the green line at Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3973.287s">This</a>  is not for the benefit of Medford residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3975.868s">This</a>  is to open the door to development. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3978.148s">And</a>  again, the City Council brought this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3981.369s">Councilor</a>  Marks brought this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=3984.981s">People</a>  outside, the last time I followed comments from, I very closely when the draft and final environmental reviews came up, about 60% of the comments, if I recall, came from people in Acton and Concord who wanted this because they want to come, park here, drive here, and take the T into Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4007.992s">Most</a>  of the Medford residents, a majority, who commented and were actually, <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4014.775s">who</a>  lived very close to the station, not even West Medford, but in the Medford Hillside area, were not in favor of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4022.956s">The</a>  last thing I want to say is, at one of the meetings in the previous series of meetings, I was speaking with Catherine Fichter, who I believe was with MassDOT. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4031.202s">She</a>  might have been with the Mass Planning Council, Massachusetts Area Planning Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4037.727s">But</a>  she actually said to me, well, we envision Medford Hillside becoming the next Davis Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4046.52s">That</a>  statement really took me aback. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4049.281s">And</a>  I would urge the city council to start getting involved and advocate for the residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4054.884s">I</a>  don't live in Davis Square because I don't want to. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4058.086s">I</a>  live where I do. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4059.947s">It</a>  is quiet. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4061.068s">I</a>  grew up actually in a very small town. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4064.89s">Even</a>  though I am 150 yards from the tracks, <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4070.04s">You</a>  could not believe how quiet it is there. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4072.922s">That</a>  is one of the things that is the best about living in Medford Hillside. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4077.324s">It</a>  is peaceful. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4078.085s">It</a>  is quiet. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4078.725s">And</a>  even with the commuter rail, which runs occasionally, and an occasional freight train, those are occasional occurrences. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4085.689s">They're</a>  not disruptive to your life. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4087.991s">A</a>  Green Line train running every 10 or 15 minutes all day would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4092.413s">And</a>  I would really urge the city council to start advocating for the residents of Medford Hillside who do not <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4099.473s">want</a>  the development that would come with this station. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4103.894s">It</a>  is clear from the meetings that this is not just going to be a simple station. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4110.037s">There's</a>  going to be a lot that goes with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4112.977s">It's</a>  going to be a magnet for development. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4115.058s">And</a>  I would really, really urge you to pay attention and listen to the concerns of the residents of the area.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4663.066s">OK,</a>  perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4663.486s">Sounds</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4665.207s">Yeah,</a>  so throughout the last few months, I've received a lot of calls with regard to the police station, the progress that's been made. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4672.031s">And</a>  I know the administration has been working hard with the chief of police and the Medford Police Department with ongoing meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4679.676s">with</a>  regard to the future of the police station in that project in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4684.277s">So</a>  I just think, you know, we've already appropriated some money and I know we're going to be appropriating money in the future to build a police station, that it's fair that we at this point in time ask for an update with regard to the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4696.58s">Any</a>  information that we can receive in, you know, timeline as well I think would be beneficial to all of us just because I know that I'm receiving calls, I'm sure many members have been receiving calls about this issue as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4708.762s">So</a>  if we could receive some sort of formal communication from the administration, just updating us with regard to this issue, or committee of the whole meeting, if that's the way members would like to go, I think that's fine too. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4720.111s">So,</a>  I move approval.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4722.693s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor McLaren. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4726.596s">Sorry,</a>  Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4728.679s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4729.639s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4731.0s">I'm</a>  just hoping I can amend the paper with no objection from the Councilor to get an update also from the fire training tower search committee and where they are in the process as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4740.022s">Part</a>  of the appropriation for the design funds for the police station was also a commitment from the administration as well as the creation of an ad hoc group to go out there and be sure that we have the opportunity and ability to relocate our fire training tower with the construction of a new police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4753.286s">So</a>  I'd just like to ask for an update from our training tower committee as well, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4757.407s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4758.007s">Council</a>  Member O'Kurin. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4759.188s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4760.589s">I</a>  want to thank Councilor Falco for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4762.811s">I</a>  too have, you know, received questions, people questioning what's the process, where we are at the process with the police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4769.495s">So</a>  I wanted to second the resolve. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4771.476s">I</a>  think it is time that the City Council gets a written update of where we're at. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4776.079s">I</a>  know that the Mayor spoke of <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4782.112s">the</a>  process and how it takes time during the debate, but a written update so that we know exactly what's taking place, where we are now, and a timeline of where we're going to be in the next few months. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4794.584s">That</a>  way we can tell our constituents as well as those who work in the police department a timeline and we have an idea of what's going on that will be beneficial. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4803.613s">And</a>  also maybe going forward if I could just amend it that we get an update every three to six months so that we know where we're at and how we're going to proceed and how it's going to progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4813.642s">I</a>  know things take time. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4817.169s">Having</a>  answers, if the city council is informed and we can let the public know and the men and women that work there know that things are being done, I think it will be helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4828.5s">But</a>  us not ever getting an update, it doesn't help the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4832.724s">I</a>  feel as one councillor, if I'm not getting updated, then really what is going on and I really have no answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4840.191s">Letting</a>  the police department know, as well as the council, a monthly or bimonthly update would be very beneficial.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4990.372s">Thank</a>  you Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4991.373s">This</a>  is regarding the water main work that's being done on Grove Street currently. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=4997.558s">Many</a>  residents on Bustle Road were unaware that their particular road, which many people are probably familiar with, which runs right off of Grove Street, <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5008.527s">was</a>  going to be used as the staging area for heavy equipment, was going to be used for dumping of dirt and debris that was dug from the trenching of the water main work that's going on, and the wooded area that abuts <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5025.43s">the</a>  street and the train tracks, the city of Medford for many years told residents that that's not their property and they have no ownership of that land and the MBTA claims that it's not their property. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5039.113s">So</a>  I think it's only appropriate that we get a response back from the city solicitor to find out who actually owns that particular piece of land, the wooded land that runs from Grove and Bustle all the way down to Century Street Extension. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5055.375s">on</a>  Bustle Road, Mr. President, to see who has ownership. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5059.379s">I</a>  would also ask that in the future, when projects are being done, that wherever the staging area may be, even though it's not on the street where the work is currently taking place, that those residents also be notified that you're going to have heavy equipment, construction material, and anything else that's going to be placed on your road for a number of months. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5081.138s">I</a>  think that's important, Mr. President, that people get notified. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5084.842s">So</a>  that would be my motion, Mr. President, that the residents receive an update on when this equipment will be removed from Bustle and also that the city solicitor report back of ownership of the wooded area along the tracks. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5102.239s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5103.26s">Good</a>  evening.</p>

href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5446.26s">You</a>  probably also are tired of hearing Tom Lincoln and Doug Carr. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5451.839s">I'm</a>  not just a parrot for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5453.88s">I</a>  have my own opinions about the estate. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5457.061s">While</a>  we're in total agreement on the need for this $200,000, it's critically necessary funding to prevent the carriage house from total collapse. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5470.047s">I</a>  see things a little differently than them. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5472.367s">I</a>  don't think they may see this $200,000 as a one-time expenditure with only one real benefit, saving the carriage house. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5481.431s">I</a>  think differently. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5482.352s">I</a>  think that this $200,000 will also be able to reduce the amount that we'll have to spend eventually on the restoration. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5492.299s">We're</a>  calling for a repointing of walls and things like that that I don't think will need to be done twice. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5496.922s">So</a>  that's just a very little thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5498.844s">But</a>  it's an example of where I differ a bit from Tom and Doug. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5502.466s">Now,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5508.662s">I</a>  know that more of a few of you had promised the voters that you were going to avoid wasteful spending. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5513.883s">And</a>  I'd like you to look at this not as wasteful, and it's also not spending. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5518.244s">It's</a>  more of an investment. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5519.804s">And</a>  it's an investment that has a very real return on investment. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5524.245s">It</a>  has a return on investment for both the city and for the local businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5530.406s">And</a>  I have an example of benefits to local businesses that I'd like to share with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5539.608s">You</a>  may have noticed the Appalachian Mountain Club sign on the corner of Oak Street some evenings. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5545.291s">When</a>  the Appalachian Mountain Club sold their headquarters on Beacon Hill, moved to Charlestown, they kind of forgot to have meeting space in the new headquarters. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5555.615s">So</a>  they had to shop around. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5556.956s">I</a>  was part of the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5558.536s">I'm</a>  very active with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5559.997s">I</a>  was part of the committee that was looking in Newton and Somerville and other places in Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5565.32s">We</a>  finally settled on the First Baptist Church in Medford because, as was noted before, Medford's a happening place. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5572.625s">It's</a>  really convenient to get to. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5574.906s">And</a>  the church is about 50 yards from my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5580.383s">We've</a>  met there four times so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5582.664s">About</a>  500 people have come so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5585.526s">We've</a>  ordered over 60 pizzas and over 10 Greek salads from Rose's on High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5592.371s">The</a>  Millennials, the young members group, is soon going to start using it. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5595.833s">And</a>  they're going to be looking for a sit-down restaurant to go to after their meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5600.138s">The</a>  Korean barbecue, you know, all you can eat place will be, Sura, will be very, you know, popular with them and they'll see a real uptick in business as well as the other local sit-down restaurants. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5614.267s">So</a>  that's just one example of, you know, where meetings can benefit the local business. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5619.391s">Weddings,</a>  too. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5620.532s">Weddings</a>  will have a need for catering, they'll have a need <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5624.743s">limousines,</a>  they'll have a need for tents, other equipment like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5629.186s">These</a>  are things that the business benefits that the business community will get. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5632.928s">Now,</a>  the city will also get the benefit of not having <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5640.945s">You</a>  know, the drag that the city building, the manor and the carriage house, and they're a drag on the budget right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5650.468s">However,</a>  if the carriage house can be restored to where it can start hosting weddings and meetings and things like that, it'll start generating revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5659.631s">And</a>  a good example of another, what I hope will be our competition, <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5665.313s">A</a>  building similar to the Brooks Estate Manor is the Whittemore Robins House over in Arlington. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5671.656s">That</a>  building is totally self-sustaining just from the revenue from weddings. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5678.519s">Now,</a>  a wedding over there cost about $2,000, which if you know anybody who's gotten married recently, it's a real bargain. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5685.483s">I</a>  had one of my weddings over there, and I'm pretty cheap, and that's why we chose them. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5694.577s">The</a>  Whittemore Robins House has two drawbacks that the Brooks Estate Carriage House does not have or will not have. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5700.701s">One,</a>  you can only fit about 66 people in the two rooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5704.703s">What</a>  they have are two rooms and an archway in the middle. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5707.845s">They</a>  can have a capacity of about 66 people. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5712.573s">The</a>  Brooks Estate will have a greater capacity and the Brooks Estate will have parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5717.235s">There's</a>  no available parking at the Whittemore Robins House, except for a few handicapped spots right behind the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5723.437s">But</a>  we'll see significantly more revenue from weddings and meetings at the Brooks Estate <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5730.54s">But</a>  we've also got significantly more expenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5734.221s">We've</a>  got two properties, two buildings to maintain, and the overhead associated with them is greater than the overhead for the one Wintermore Robins house. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5744.203s">We'll</a>  also have to pay off the bonds that'll be needed for restoration. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5748.464s">Those</a>  are expenses that the Wintermore Robins house doesn't have. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5752.325s">However,</a>  the expense of <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5754.986s">maintaining</a>  the manor is something we're going to have anyway, whether we have the income from the carriage house or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5762.778s">So</a>  it makes sense to get the revenue from the carriage house. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5767.064s">And</a>  the only way we can do that is if we save the carriage house. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5770.65s">If</a>  it's continued in its current state, it's probably not going to last the winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5776.114s">If</a>  we get a winter like we had a couple of years ago with unprecedented amounts of snow, it's probably going to be history without this funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5783.901s">So</a>  I see your decision tonight as kind of binary. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5787.584s">You</a>  can either authorize the $200,000 disbursement from free cash and save the only source of revenue, or you could waste the money that's already been put into the manor and into the estate. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5800.195s">It's</a>  a pretty clear choice that if we want to continue the manor as a viable institution and the estate as a viable institution, we need to save that carriage house.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5815.003s">Any</a>  questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5815.684s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5816.404s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo? <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5817.785s">Move</a>  approval, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5820.527s">Councilor</a>  Falco? <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5822.209s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5823.009s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Warren, for your presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5824.79s">Just</a>  a couple of quick questions here. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5827.172s">So,</a>  in the description, it mentions all the work that needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5831.616s">If</a>  this was to pass tonight, do you know how long it would take to do all that work?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5837.44s">Is</a>  this going to happen over a long time span? <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5840.421s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5841.002s">It</a>  may go into the spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5842.362s">But</a>  we have to get up two by six supporting walls. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5846.424s">We</a>  have to get supports for the roof and trusses. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5849.546s">Maybe</a>  Tom and Doug can speak more exactly about how quickly it can be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5854.568s">But</a>  it's work that would have to start immediately to save it from the impact of this winter.</p>

    <p>[Doug Carr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5863.228s">Doug</a>  Carr, 124 Boston Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5864.77s">Councilor</a>  Falco, this is probably about a six-week process to execute the plans that you've seen by a couple contractors, so we want to get it started obviously before the winter really starts, but they can do this work largely during the winter as well.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5880.642s">Do</a>  you know how much it would cost to totally rehabilitate the carriage house?</p>

    <p>[Doug Carr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5885.724s">Yeah,</a>  it's grown. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5887.505s">It</a>  grows every year by between $1,500,000 with inflation, but it's between $1.5 and $2 million total. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5894.707s">That's</a>  the carriage house. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5895.847s">That's</a>  the carriage house restoration, just the carriage house. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5898.068s">The</a>  master plan has a detailed cost estimate in it.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5904.11s">So</a>  I've only been on the council for about two years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5906.751s">And</a>  during that time, we talked about the Brooks Estate a little bit here and there, but this is, I think, the first time that something's come before me to appropriate money for the Brooks Estate. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5920.659s">And</a>  I would agree with Mr. Warren. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5922.76s">The</a>  way I look at this, this is an investment. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5925.522s">If</a>  we own it, we should embrace it. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5928.188s">And</a>  we own it, and we should be embracing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5931.19s">This</a>  is a project that I think that's good. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5933.571s">I</a>  think, in my opinion, there's a lot of potential here. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5936.372s">There's</a>  a lot of potential. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5938.573s">I've</a>  scanned the business plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5939.854s">I</a>  think that was the master plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5941.995s">I've</a>  seen that before. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5942.875s">And</a>  I think that there's a lot of potential with this property. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5948.798s">It's</a>  a long-term investment, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5950.099s">But</a>  if we own it, we should be investing in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5952.28s">It</a>  doesn't do us any good to let it rot away in the woods. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5956.842s">As</a>  time goes by, it only becomes more expensive to fix it. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5960.364s">So</a>  it's an investment that I think we should be making. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5962.526s">I</a>  second the resolution tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5966.328s">And</a>  thank you for your time.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5968.349s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5968.69s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5970.411s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5971.892s">Yes,</a>  Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5972.572s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5973.392s">This</a>  is for any one of you gentlemen. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5975.794s">About</a>  how much money does the Medford Brooks Estate Land Trust have in its coffers at this point?</p>

    <p>[Tom Lincoln]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5981.357s">We</a>  have about $60,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5982.158s">I</a>  would like to make one other point. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5985.94s">About</a>  the manor if I might the manor is very far along. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5990.022s">We've</a>  been working with the Mackey group the artist group We've had some they've had some events there. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=5996.645s">We're</a>  hoping to work on a regular basis Just in terms of community outreach. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6002.347s">We're</a>  doing some walks now with the walk Medford group I don't know how familiar you are with them, but they are absolutely fabulous in terms of <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6010.531s">of</a>  energy. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6011.713s">The</a>  other issue about the carriage house is that this also buys time. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6016.98s">We</a>  understand that the entire funding package is not at hand at this point, and we've advanced the project on many other fronts in the interim. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6028.755s">But</a>  with stabilization, it gives you the opportunity to restore the carriage house. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6036.021s">You</a>  reach a certain point, and we've talked about this quite frequently, you reach a certain point, that opportunity is gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6043.666s">The</a>  investment is no longer there. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6048.21s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6049.15s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6049.831s">Also,</a>  Mr. President, are the renovations to the manor finally complete and it's at its final end state?</p>

    <p>[Tom Lincoln]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6056.336s">Basically,</a>  the, we've done a long list of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6060.538s">Remember,</a>  the manor was in very, very bad shape when the council passed the preservation and conservation, conservation preservation restriction in 1998. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6072.484s">We've</a>  secured a new roof, five chimneys, 70 windows with shutters. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6078.407s">We</a>  paid for a new boiler. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6081.689s">I</a>  think that was $18,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6084.51s">The</a>  building is handicap accessible, which includes a lift to the second floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6090.112s">We've</a>  replaced the veranda. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6092.093s">We've</a>  replaced the west porch. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6094.454s">I</a>  think I'm more concerned about what isn't done than what has been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6097.475s">What</a>  is not done is painting and a little bit of woodwork on the second and third floor trim. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6109.501s">Some</a>  smaller amenities, for example, we're putting in shades and drapes in some of the rooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6117.308s">And</a>  maybe Mr. Carr can think of some other things here. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6120.13s">Has</a>  the plumbing issue been addressed up there?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6122.693s">I</a>  know there was a plumbing issue that was going on.</p>

    <p>[Tom Lincoln]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6126.118s">The</a>  water supply passes the test, if that's the right word. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6133.488s">The</a>  pressure is not very good. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6135.811s">It's</a>  certainly adequate. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6137.433s">for</a>  current needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6139.755s">It's</a>  interesting that the Grove Street project was mentioned because the water pressure in this whole area, both on the Playstead Road side and the Grove Street side, I think this is quite common across Medford actually, is not great. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6153.684s">As</a>  we've discussed before, the other issue here is the actual drive, the access drive, which is 1,900 feet from Grove Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6162.09s">And</a>  it makes eminent sense to, when that is redone, to furnish a new water line at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6170.654s">It's</a>  very interesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6171.274s">There</a>  was a discussion here earlier.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6172.475s">So</a>  when we flush the toilets, it still goes into the leaching?</p>

    <p>[Tom Lincoln]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6174.656s">Oh,</a>  yes, it does. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6179.418s">But</a>  this is not a commercial building at this point.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6182.279s">And</a>  then we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6182.859s">So</a>  it's the 75th anniversary this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6185.5s">So</a>  what type of programming do we have coming out of there now that we have the? <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6189.277s">manner</a>  renovations near completion, do we have any type of snowshoeing, after school programs for kids, bird watching, anything like that?</p>

    <p>[Tom Lincoln]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6198.465s">The</a>  road is an impediment to certain heavier uses, and that's just a fact of life at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6205.952s">We've</a>  had speaking programs, I mentioned we're working with the Mackey <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6211.637s">We've</a>  had a number of open houses, walking tours. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6215.86s">We've</a>  worked with the Victorian Society, which also is very interested in the Episcopal Church in your neighborhood, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6226.407s">So,</a>  you know, we're and of course the property is not just two historic buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6231.528s">It's</a>  it's a 50 acres of conserved Habitat open space, which it gets a lot of daily usage We've had relationships with Tufts for our work days We've done and hope to do more Boy Scout what you call a Eagle Scout projects and we're certainly hoping to <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6254.454s">do</a>  more on all these fronts. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6258.238s">This</a>  is such a multifaceted project.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6260.42s">Do</a>  we have trails mapped out there so people can come and pick up a map?</p>

    <p>[Tom Lincoln]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6263.884s">There's</a>  a free trail map.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6267.668s">Yeah,</a>  go ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6268.388s">And</a>  trail maintenance is being done.</p>

    <p>[Doug Carr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6269.809s">Yeah,</a>  we're looking to go after some CPA funds, not only to design the road, because the road, as Councilor Mark has commented several times, could be done earlier with parking and the utilities in advance of the entire restoration. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6286.779s">We</a>  could do that, which will actually open up for a lot more public usage of this property and the buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6292.923s">The</a>  carriage house presently has no utilities at all right now for anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6296.786s">So</a>  obviously that would be done when the building was done. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6300.449s">But</a>  we think there's a great opportunity not only with CPA funds for the trails as well, but the road, the trails. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6307.095s">But</a>  CPA won't pay for maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6309.136s">That's</a>  just a part of the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6310.858s">It</a>  has to be capital improvement and public benefit. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6313.86s">It</a>  can't be for maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6314.761s">This</a>  is clearly just pure maintenance at the point. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6317.683s">Otherwise,</a>  we wouldn't be going for the CPA funds for this very cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6321.935s">Any</a>  other questions?</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6339.657s">most</a>  desirable sites in Medford when you talk about history and what the Brooks State talks about the Brooks Manor and the Carriage House and making sure that we continue with that and making sure that <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6359.245s">our</a>  kids' kids can follow with what we're trying to do here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6363.686s">One</a>  of the pieces that I wanted to bring along is as we had our discussions last year and looking into the recreation, full-time recreation program, and you look at the partnerships that, you know, I personally use in my community with recreation and look to see what kind of funding we can bring for both organizations, I think is a plus in the community I work for. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6387.492s">And</a>  looking at the Brooks Estates, <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6390.396s">Excuse</a>  me, the Brooks, the manor and the carriage house, it was one of the biggest. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6397.232s">attractions</a>  when we talked to different constituents. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6400.513s">And</a>  I know that Councilor Knight mentioned it, but you talk about the trails, you talk about the area and what recreation really means. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6410.775s">It's</a>  not just parks and playing games anymore, but when you're talking about snowshoeing and trail walking and then fishing and the other issues that <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6422.738s">people</a>  don't realize when you talk about nature and getting out and bird watching and covering insects. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6435.513s">There's</a>  so many out-of-the-box thinking and using <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6441.393s">this</a>  wonderful location as a jumping point. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6444.894s">I</a>  think that it's a historical piece, but this is new life that could be fed off that. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6452.696s">So</a>  I'm really excited about it.</p>

    <p>[Tom Lincoln]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6454.137s">I</a>  greatly appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6455.037s">I</a>  forgot to mention, we have done some walks for young children. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6459.598s">I'm</a>  sorry, I can't remember the name. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6461.939s">Actually,</a>  it's a preschool in West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6464.08s">I</a>  think they used to run out. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6465.76s">It's,</a>  no, yeah, I'm sorry, yeah, that sort of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6470.864s">We've</a>  also thought a lot about, there's been some wonderful things going on in the Fells vis-a-vis the high school, and this is exactly the same kind of environment as the Fells in terms of some of the <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6481.593s">issues</a>  of invasives and that sort of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6484.457s">So</a>  it's always a matter of, with this kind of programming, of finding the passionate person, the person that has the knowledge. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6493.909s">I</a>  mean, I'm not capable of talking about the <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6497.333s">ecological</a>  detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6498.394s">It's</a>  not Brooks' Day, but somebody certainly is. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6501.115s">And</a>  I think it's important to remember, too, that a lot of people have been benefiting from this property for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6507.739s">You</a>  know, they take their daily walk. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6509.12s">They</a>  get away from Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6510.581s">And</a>  the last thing I want to mention on the history side is that it's not just the Brooks family. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6514.183s">In</a>  fact, you know, this is not a monument to the Brooks family. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6517.225s">What</a>  this is, is a monument to, and a reminder of 300 years of Medford history. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6523.228s">I</a>  mean, there were 200 veterans' families living at the Brooks Estate from 1946 to 1954. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6529.16s">Many</a>  of their descendants are still in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6531.744s">We</a>  know a lot of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6532.606s">In</a>  fact, we did a reunion some years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6536.785s">in</a>  1996, actually. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6539.207s">And</a>  so this is a living history kind of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6542.41s">It's</a>  really something that we felt, we've always felt very strongly belongs to the people that own it. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6548.655s">And</a>  we worked, I think, really hard to make that come alive. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6553.939s">I</a>  only say that, I would only say that <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6556.161s">If</a>  we knew how big this project was when we started, we might be thinking differently. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6560.406s">But</a>  we're right in the middle of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6561.868s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6562.188s">So</a>  John and I see the easy part. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6564.21s">So</a>  this wasn't a big deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6565.832s">No,</a>  I'm not going to say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6567.955s">But</a>  again, we've all preached our historical sites and how important they are to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6572.38s">And</a>  I think this is the granddaddy of them all. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6575.003s">So</a>  thank you for all your hard work.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6577.705s">Vice</a>  President Mox. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6580.027s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6582.99s">I'm</a>  not aware of any other capital plan that's going on in the community currently. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6587.613s">And</a>  maybe if the people that spoke at the podium are aware of another capital plan that may be out there that we're going to be talking about not only shoring up and buttoning up the potential carriage house from collapsing, but <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6605.958s">maybe</a>  a capital improvement plan that we've discussed several years back for the site?</p>

    <p>[Tom Lincoln]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6611.142s">Well,</a>  we have updated, this has actually happened last year at this point, earlier this year, updated some of the numbers from the master plan and presented that to the mayor at her request. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6628.977s">And</a>  we have not heard <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6631.699s">you</a>  know, whether there is, you know, another five-year capital plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6635.603s">As</a>  you recall, this was part of the laundry list, if that's the right word, of capital items a few years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6643.691s">And</a>  so I honestly don't have any other knowledge than that in terms of, but it's certainly, we would certainly advocate <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6654.001s">You</a>  know as a public facility and as a something that's been known by the city for a long time that we'd be part of that process when it happens Thank you Mr. President</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6668.129s">You</a>  know, I've been involved in this process for a number of years and was part of the discussion when the Brooks Estate's master plan was presented to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6677.655s">And</a>  I thought at that time the plan really <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6683.619s">was</a>  forthcoming and a lot of due diligence went into the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6687.161s">And</a>  at the time, I think as a compromise, because I don't think the support was there to do the manor and the carriage house, was to work on the road, which I think was at the time a million two or a million three, or maybe a little more than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6704.993s">And</a>  to me, the road is the fundamental issue here. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6709.255s">Because</a>  right now, I'd ask anyone in the community trying to get up there, <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6713.558s">It's</a>  extremely, extremely difficult, unless you're in a four-wheel vehicle, to get up to that site. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6720.863s">It</a>  really is. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6721.504s">And</a>  I don't think I'm, you know, playing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6724.966s">It's</a>  very difficult to get up to the site. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6727.689s">And</a>  I, as one member of the council, think if, you know, we're going to do anything or talk about plans for the Brooks Estates, we have to look at the infrastructure leading up to the Brooks Estates. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6739.479s">And</a>  if that's an issue, that should be part of a capital plan that we should be discussing. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6746.324s">And,</a>  you know, I'm not opposed to making sure the carriage house doesn't fall down. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6751.447s">I</a>  appreciate the significance, historical significance of that property and maintaining the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6758.011s">But</a>  in all good conscience, you know, and I'm sure the people that have been involved with the Brooks estates don't like to hear it. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6765.855s">You</a>  know, when I hear from firefighters saying, how can you sink money into this and not address concerns we've been bringing up about our fire stations throughout the community, what do I say to that? <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6778.943s">I</a>  say that we need a capital plan to address not only this issue, but the other issues we've been hearing about. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6786.587s">You</a>  know, when you hear firefighters say that the HVA system doesn't work, when you hear them saying that windows don't open or close, <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6795.252s">When</a>  you hear them talking in the main headquarters about deplorable conditions, which I viewed firsthand of the showers in the restrooms in the headquarters. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6805.88s">When</a>  you talk about the bunker gear, we still have new washes that they purchased. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6813.325s">But</a>  they didn't purchase the dryers. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6815.388s">So</a>  they have to air dry the new bunker gear, which takes many, many more extended hours to air dry the bunker gear. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6822.679s">I</a>  mean, these are just a few. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6824.121s">The</a>  fire alarm system on Salem Street doesn't work. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6828.327s">You</a>  go into the kitchen, there's a hole in the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6831.492s">These</a>  are where men and women are spending seven days a week, 24 hours a day, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6837.7s">And</a>  I don't want to cloud the issue with the Brooks estates, because I think they should run on its own merit. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6843.248s">But</a>  how do we stand up here in good faith and vote for $200,000 without having a meeting on this? <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6849.394s">This</a>  is the first meeting, Mr. President, and I'm glad Councilor Dello Russo feels comfortable to move forward on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6855.42s">I</a>  know he's been a big advocate of the Brooks estates over the years, and I know he feels comfortable, Mr. President, but I don't know how much of the $200,000 is going to go towards just the capping off of the building so it doesn't pour inside the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6868.672s">how</a>  much is gonna go towards the repointing of the chimney, how much is gonna go towards the decking and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6874.598s">I</a>  think that'd be interesting to know when we're almost spending a quarter of a million dollars on what it's gonna be spent on, Mr. President, and what we expect. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6884.027s">Is</a>  this going to be buttoned up for the next 10 years or is it possible that there is a capital plan coming down in six months from now and we're going to have to take the envelope off the building after spending $200,000? <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6895.609s">And</a>  I realize and I appreciate some of the issues that you brought up, sir, about potential upgrades to or somewhat upgrades to the Carriage House that could be used down the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6907.612s">But</a>  these are the things, Mr. President, that I'm struggling with on <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6912.533s">looking</a>  at other infrastructure needs in the community and saying, hey, wait a minute, you know, we do have a carriage house that's in deplorable condition, that's on the verge of collapse. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6923.617s">And</a>  we remember last time we had another building called the DPW building in the city that was in terrible condition and condemned by the Board of Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6933.682s">And</a>  I don't want to go in that direction with our fire stations. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6937.818s">And</a>  we're at that level on many of these buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6941.28s">And</a>  I can't in good faith vote for any package right now until I see a capital plan that's outlined, Mr. President, that not only addresses this important issue, but every other capital issue in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6955.69s">And</a>  it goes to roads and sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6957.652s">We</a>  all sit behind this railing and say, oh, we want the sidewalks, we want the potholes, but we're not putting any money, we're not putting any investment into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6967.35s">This</a>  is a worthy issue, Mr. President, but I'm not going to jump on it tonight, and I'm not going to be under any political pressure to jump on this tonight, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6975.816s">We</a>  were told last year by the proponents that this building wasn't going to last through the winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6982.061s">If</a>  I'm not mistaken, I think that was a direct quote when they asked for money to buckle it up last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6987.966s">It</a>  might have even been two years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6989.727s">Was</a>  it two years? <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6990.828s">And</a>  it wasn't going to last through winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6992.649s">Two</a>  winters have gone by. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6994.311s">The</a>  building's still standing, I'm sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=6995.813s">It's</a>  probably in less wear for the good.</p>

    <p>[Doug Carr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7000.037s">I</a>  don't think that's a fair assessment of the situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7004.643s">That's</a>  your opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7005.384s">No,</a>  it is my opinion.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7006.665s">Right,</a>  you're entitled to your opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7007.987s">I'm</a>  making a statement.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7012.083s">So</a>  Mr. President, as I stated, you know,</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7026.915s">This</a>  shouldn't be a quick knee-jerk reaction of $200,000 to spend when we have so many other issues that are confronting infrastructure issues in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7038.078s">I</a>  just pointed out a few. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7039.518s">I'm</a>  not going to go through a laundry list of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7041.578s">But</a>  if we get presented with a capital plan that makes sense, that addresses the current needs, I'll be on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7049.68s">We</a>  have over $8 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7050.681s">You</a>  read it in the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7051.981s">$8</a>  million in free cash out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7053.661s">We</a>  can address a lot of needs, Mr. President, and this is one of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7057.383s">And</a>  I think it should be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7059.505s">But</a>  let's not do the piecemeal. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7061.287s">Let's</a>  not forget what we talked about last year and the year before, that we're going to get piecemealed to death on issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7068.215s">Oh,</a>  here's the next issue that the mayor wants to present. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7070.777s">Here's</a>  the piecemeal issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7072.94s">Let's</a>  present a capital plan that makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7075.543s">The</a>  homework is done on this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7077.705s">I</a>  don't think Mr. Link and Mr. Carr, I don't think they have to go back and do the homework on this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7082.129s">They</a>  presented a project that, in my opinion, is worthy of debate and discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7086.593s">Let's</a>  talk about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7087.994s">We're</a>  talking about revitalizing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7089.536s">You</a>  know, buttoning up the carriage house, in my opinion, sounds good, might make you feel good, but does it address really the issue and the needs of the Brooks estates? <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7100.58s">I,</a>  you may think so. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7102.482s">I</a>  don't think so. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7103.422s">I</a>  think we have to look at a larger picture on this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7107.065s">And</a>  I, for one, am not prepared tonight, Mr. President, to support this paper unless I see a full capital plan on the needs of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7117.834s">And</a>  also, if the Brooks Estates has 60,000 that they were able to raise, that, some of that portion of that money should go towards the buckling up of this building. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7127.7s">That's</a>  what they're raising money for. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7129.381s">That's</a>  what the intent is. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7131.802s">And</a>  if that's the case, fine, but that's not what we were presented tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7135.925s">It's</a>  200,000 of free cash to do that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7140.607s">So</a>  those are my comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7142.928s">I'd</a>  love to hear from the members that kept this Brooks Estates alive for so many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7151.233s">I</a>  mean, this is truly a volunteer basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7154.694s">Otherwise,</a>  this building would be the same faith as many of our other city-owned buildings in the community, which would be rubble. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7163.397s">So</a>  those are my comments, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7166.093s">Mr.</a>  Warren, would you like to address some of the council's comments?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7168.535s">Yes,</a>  I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7168.755s">I'm</a>  new, but I can address many of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7171.897s">You're</a>  totally right about the road, and we're going to be seeking CPA money to rebuild that, to look for the design first, and then to be rebuilding that. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7182.065s">And</a>  that'll be in the spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7183.626s">When</a>  is the funding for CPA? <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7185.808s">It'll</a>  occur in the spring.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7187.93s">So</a>  the road is not maintenance, but the building, the carriage house is considered maintenance.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7194.355s">Yes,</a>  it's deferred maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7195.696s">We</a>  can't use the CPA funding for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7198.578s">It</a>  has to come from free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7200.479s">It's</a>  not a capital investment as maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7205.783s">A</a>  capital investment is the sort of thing we would have to float a bond for. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7209.653s">Or,</a>  you know, if we can, use CPA money. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7212.634s">That</a>  would be the preferred route. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7214.094s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7215.494s">But</a>  where this isn't a capital investment, and by the way, if you'd like, I have the exact numbers for, you know, the repairs, and I can summarize them for you if you'd like.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7224.796s">Well,</a>  I think that'd be helpful to pass out to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7227.016s">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7227.896s">I</a>  only have one copy with me, but.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7229.957s">City</a>  messenger can make a copy.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7232.937s">One,</a>  you know, I can go through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7234.958s">I</a>  don't need my time. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7236.557s">But</a>  some things like the plywood, it looks like it's a huge dollar item, but every window in that carriage house has to be boarded up using a special T111 plywood that's exterior grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7248.713s">It's</a>  pretty expensive stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7255.95s">But</a>  the idea that we have to just study this and study it, the problem is we've had two, I don't know what was said two years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7265.768s">I</a>  wasn't here. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7268.417s">But</a>  assuming they did say that it was going to fall down that winter, we've had two very, very light winters. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7274.539s">The</a>  winter before that was huge. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7277.06s">It</a>  was record setting. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7278.621s">If</a>  we have a winter like that again, I can guarantee you that it's going to fall down. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7282.102s">I</a>  mean, when I first went out there before I'd been appointed, I wanted to be able to tell the mayor I'd at least been out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7288.004s">And</a>  I saw the building, and I thought it was a total knockdown. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7291.086s">It</a>  was total loss already. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7295.967s">I</a>  didn't think that was a big deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7297.467s">You</a>  could build a new modern structure there that would be much more efficient. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7302.128s">Then</a>  I did a little research. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7303.569s">And</a>  it's much easier to do research now. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7305.989s">I</a>  used to be an attorney for the city of Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7308.149s">And</a>  it was much more difficult to research things back then. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7310.75s">But</a>  now you just go on Wikipedia, and you can see, in 1998, a conservation and preservation restriction was put on the property that would require us. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7320.232s">We</a>  can't just put up a new structure. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7323.033s">We</a>  have to rebuild the existing structure. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7327.565s">Financially,</a>  that's unfortunate, but we're preserving the history. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7330.908s">Like</a>  the Whittemore Robins House, it's a really rich part of the Medford history. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7336.393s">There's</a>  this Arlington history. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7340.436s">The</a>  historic value is huge. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7342.717s">and</a>  if we don't get the $200,000 in funding, we may not have a second chance to restore that new carriage house to the point where it creates revenue and it's paying for the manor, it's helping out local businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7357.94s">We</a>  may not get that chance again. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7359.881s">This</a>  may be a one-shot deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7362.121s">Maybe</a>  two years from now, without funding it, maybe it'll hold up. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7368.943s">Maybe</a>  not though, probably not.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7371.46s">Don't</a>  you agree it's a sad commentary at this point after all these years we're talking about just buckling up and trying to save a building from falling down after all these years. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7381.283s">And</a>  that's why I say we need to even though the proposal didn't go through a few years ago this needs to be revisited again. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7388.425s">This,</a>  we have to have a direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7390.366s">Where</a>  are we going with this? <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7391.926s">We</a>  have to have a direction.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7393.106s">I</a>  agree that the MAS plan really has to be looked at and should, you know, ultimately, you know, be funded, but hopefully funded in phases. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7400.048s">So</a>  it's not going to kill. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7401.009s">I'm</a>  also a taxpayer here now, but a couple of years, you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7404.449s">It</a>  is sad that we've come to this point, but think too, we've saved a lot of money by not doing that maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7410.251s">It</a>  was essentially an abandoned building for years.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7413.94s">If</a>  you tried to maintain every abandoned building in the city, you know, you wouldn't have as much free cash as you have now. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7420.745s">So</a>  for a while, it was an abandoned building. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7423.407s">It</a>  had no real purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7425.008s">It</a>  had no real plans for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7427.21s">But</a>  now there is a real purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7429.131s">People</a>  want to save it. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7430.152s">People</a>  want the history. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7432.033s">And</a>  it's vital to, you know, stabilize it now and use some of those funds that we saved from years past when we didn't do any maintenance to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7441.607s">So</a>  that's why I'm thinking it's a good investment now, just looking at it from a financial standpoint. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7448.728s">But</a>  you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7449.228s">We</a>  do have to look more closely at funding the whole thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7453.209s">And</a>  then it'll be a very wise investment.</p>

    <p>[Doug Carr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7458.29s">If</a>  I could just add on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7460.51s">Obviously,</a>  if we had passed the bond two or three years ago, the Carriage House would have been restored right now and actually generating money to pay off the debt. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7471.174s">make</a>  so many more people be able to use it. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7473.74s">I</a>  would just add a couple of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7477.669s">when</a>  the city council funded a study to fix the carriage house, which was what we did, you guys did two years ago, it was so unsafe in there that they actually had to buy some wood and stabilize just a couple of things so they could do their job safely. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7494.054s">That's</a>  why the building didn't fall down last year, because they had to actually do some temporary shoring just to be safe in the building itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7504.157s">It</a>  is, <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7505.605s">It</a>  is condemned. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7506.826s">It</a>  is not safe to go into that building today if you're not a professional like Paul Mulkey and other people. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7513.57s">And</a>  yes, M-Belt has $60,000, but I feel like we're being held to a different standard. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7519.574s">You</a>  don't ask the, no one asks the friends of the Medford Public Library to pay for the library roof when it leaks. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7525.458s">I</a>  don't know why M-Belt and the members of M-Belt, which have sunk over a quarter million dollars of private money, <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7532.543s">in</a>  St. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7532.743s">Brooks</a>  Estate in the last 15 years, why we're being asked to do everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7538.525s">Maintenance.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7539.545s">I</a>  mean, that's not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7541.025s">Nobody</a>  funds maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7543.446s">That's</a>  the city's job. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7545.386s">We</a>  all own this building. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7547.407s">We</a>  go after grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7548.107s">We've</a>  gotten grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7548.787s">We've</a>  gotten over $400,000 in grant money in the last 10 years for the roof, <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7556.291s">And</a>  this is not just CDBG money, but I'm talking about Cummings Foundation, Mass Preservation Projects Funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7562.362s">We've</a>  put our own money into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7563.705s">But</a>  we can only take it so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7565.508s">We</a>  need a partner in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7568.168s">And</a>  you guys have been there for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7569.448s">You've</a>  given us a lot of money over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7570.769s">But</a>  clearly, the clock is ticking here. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7572.89s">I</a>  just don't want the Brooksville State to be held hostage, because I agree, we need a police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7577.972s">We</a>  need a fire station. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7578.712s">But</a>  that's not a reason not to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7581.373s">We</a>  do need a capital plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7582.313s">I</a>  agree with the Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7583.554s">But</a>  we can't wait forever and ever. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7586.315s">And</a>  every year, it becomes more and more expensive to restore this place, the road, the buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7593.738s">We</a>  just need to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7595.158s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7596.039s">Council</a>  Boxer, you're done?</p>

    <p>[Tom Lincoln]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7598.834s">I</a>  also agree we need a capital plan, but I would point out that <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7603.943s">I</a>  don't know how to say this, but it's not our job to create the capital plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7607.384s">We've</a>  created a roadmap for the complete restoration of the estate. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7613.386s">We</a>  did a tremendous amount of work on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7616.167s">We're</a>  all volunteers. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7617.308s">We</a>  paid for outside expertise. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7621.969s">We</a>  have a very nuanced and deep understanding of the needs of the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7628.792s">Unfortunately,</a>  with the Carriage House, this has been deferred. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7633.133s">It's</a>  not just two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7634.514s">This</a>  was in the capital plan, which is in the fall of 2011, and it was discussed quite a lot in the year and a half following that. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7642.48s">I've</a>  kind of lost the chronology. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7645.042s">So</a>  it should not be a surprise, I guess, is one way of saying it. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7653.928s">It</a>  really, in the broader sense of things, this is buying time. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7659.016s">I</a>  think Councilor Marks asked, when you button this up, what do you get? <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7662.902s">You</a>  get at least five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7664.163s">You</a>  can probably get 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7665.866s">And</a>  I'm not an expert on it, but that's certainly not <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7670.713s">Unreasonable</a>  plan Unreasonable and we certainly ought to be able to have a capital plan in five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7676.378s">I</a>  would hope and there's certainly a lot less Than that and the other thing is and this has been true from the get-go. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7684.826s">This</a>  project is different and <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7686.607s">From</a>  a police station police stations absolutely critical. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7690.132s">I'd</a>  be the first to say we should have had a new police station some time ago and you've seen the detailed problems there But this this unlike a police station this comes with a potential revenue stream with a way of paying off <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7705.45s">Bonds,</a>  we can't predict the future entirely, but it's certainly a model that's been used as we've said many times been used successfully all around the country for projects like this heritage projects projects benefit the community and The long the long term we've been in this for the long term I I <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7725.823s">Personally,</a>  did not expect to be working on this for 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7729.887s">And</a>  I'm 66, and I don't think I have another 20 years to work on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7734.17s">I</a>  doubt. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7735.532s">But</a>  maybe I'll be fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7736.993s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7738.094s">So</a>  it's really, you know, I think as Mr. Carr has said, we've said that on this piece of this, this critical piece of this, the clock is ticking. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7749.484s">This</a>  is a physical reality.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7752.046s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7757.433s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7760.575s">I</a>  want to first thank the gentleman for the breakdown. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7765.137s">That</a>  was going to be one of my questions, so getting a breakdown of the 200,000 helps. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7770.354s">And</a>  then it was brought up that CPA funds can't be used for this, but there will be an application for monies from CPA for the design of the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7781.188s">Is</a>  there a, has the MBELT met or? <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7785.302s">with</a>  regards to almost like a five-year plan of what funds will be requested from CPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7791.223s">And</a>  that is attached to not only how we'll proceed with applications to the CPA from the Brooks estates, but also just goes along with the whole issue of the capital plan and the mayor's <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7805.727s">vision</a>  for this in the future, because I guess at this point we're trying to buy time. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7811.088s">But</a>  what are we buying time for? <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7812.948s">And</a>  number one, it's CPA funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7815.809s">But</a>  number two, it's what is the mayor's plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7818.549s">Because</a>  this did come before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7821.35s">It</a>  went a certain way. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7822.75s">Is</a>  this, I mean, we have the road for a million to a million and a half plus. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7827.651s">And</a>  then we have to restore it would be another 1.5 to maybe 2.5 at that point. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7834.852s">Where</a>  are we going with it is my main concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7838.593s">So</a>  I guess that would be my first question. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7840.314s">What</a>  is the plan for requesting CPA funds?</p>

    <p>[Doug Carr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7843.455s">Well,</a>  as you know, I sit on the CPA board, so I've seen firsthand how they put it together. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7848.837s">It's</a>  been a really good master plan, and you all, I think, have received copies of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7854.439s">The</a>  Brooks Estate was noted in there as a top priority for the city in the historic preservation, but also in the open space component, because it qualifies for both. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7864.083s">And</a>  we will be competing for both. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7865.384s">But</a>  obviously, we can't count on that money. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7868.626s">It's</a>  competitive. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7870.347s">There</a>  could be dozens of products. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7871.627s">The</a>  city itself can compete for them, obviously. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7877.571s">Since</a>  the plan just came out literally, the CPA plan came out literally only a week or two ago, our next board meeting, we're taking up this very subject. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7886.636s">And</a>  we will be debating it and coming up with a strategy. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7891.138s">Obviously,</a>  put forward a project every single funding round for every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7896.859s">And</a>  we'll chip away at things that make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7898.98s">You</a>  know, obviously, you actually have the ability to bond with the CPA as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7902.641s">That</a>  is one of the possibilities to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7904.401s">You</a>  still need the five votes that you need in this body, which you could do yourself, obviously. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7908.422s">But</a>  there is, you know, over the next five years, we're talking about $7.5 million, but we don't have any illusions that we're going to get anywhere near that, or even a fraction of that, for obvious reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7918.144s">Because</a>  there's a lot of needs in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7921.226s">For</a>  affordable housing and open space and recreation up beyond historic preservation. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7924.791s">So</a>  My answer is we don't have an answer right now, but we're working on it Councilor.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7929.278s">Thank</a>  you I</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7937.763s">So</a>  the first request, so you will put forward an application to the CPA on a yearly basis, which I expected anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7945.67s">I</a>  guess I was looking for more clarification on the amount, because when you're talking about a $4 million project, I want to know as a Councilor, is the CPA going to be able to fund this going forward, and if so,</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7962.023s">It's</a>  only $1.2 million.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7964.385s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7965.025s">But</a>  if you do it in stages, is that going to be the plan of the CPA? <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7968.447s">Because</a>  like Mr. Carr said, there's going to be so many organizations that are going to be vying for that $1.2 million and whatever is added into it the next several years. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7978.333s">So</a>  my main concern then is where the administration <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7982.135s">stands</a>  on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7983.516s">And</a>  I think that's something that we probably won't be able to get the answers to unless we hold off, whether that be a week or two, and ask the mayor to meet with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=7992.138s">Whether</a>  it be just on this one issue, set aside a half hour to meet with her, or if we can discuss an updated capital plan from the one we got two years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=8002.642s">I</a>  think that it's time to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=8005.042s">This</a>  council is going to be sitting for the next two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=8007.643s">And</a>  I think it's time to do that before we do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=8010.104s">Councilman</a>  Marks makes good points. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=8011.584s">Yes,</a>  you're talking police station, fire stations, library, a number of things that need to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=8016.665s">And</a>  in the Brooks Estates, there's a number of different projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=8021.406s">But</a>  we are looked at as how can you approve certain money that may or not be, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=8028.099s">just</a>  to keep something stable when we might be putting the library and the fire departments before that, and they're not going to expend the $3 million to do the Brooks Estates. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=8038.702s">I</a>  just want to get a better understanding of where we're going moving forward and what the plan is, because it seems like the council's in support of this, which is fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=8049.245s">But</a>  I just want to know where we're going in the next couple of years and what is the plan.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=8755.628s">Vice</a>  President Mox. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=8757.429s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=8758.37s">Residents</a>  on Oakland Street are extremely upset because Oakland, believe it or not, is being used as a cut-through from cars on Forest Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=8767.997s">And</a>  because of the timing of the lights, <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=8772.7s">the</a>  Forest Street lights led by three or four cars at best, and the cars are starting to queue up all the way, so cars are trying to get around that light and ending up going down Oakland, which is creating chaos on that particular street. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=8788.624s">So</a>  I would ask that our head of lights, Mr. Randazzo, fix those lights on Forest Street to allow more cars <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=8799.887s">to</a>  extend the green light to allow more cars coming down forest to access through the intersection of Medford Square.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=8809.232s">Mr.</a>  President, as a B paper, I'd like to propose that the Superintendent of Lights and Lines also provides us with a cost estimate as to what a study would cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=8819.798s">City</a>  of Medford and the Traffic Division and the Council pushing to reduce the speed limit from 30 to 25 miles an hour in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=8825.862s">That</a>  does have an absolute effect on the timing of lights and the traffic patterns and the traffic flow in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=8831.566s">That's</a>  why we did it. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=8832.927s">So</a>  we can reduce the speed limit in the community, but if we don't go and look at the timing of the lights across the community, I think we're missing a key component to the purpose of doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=8842.353s">So</a>  I'd like to ask in the form of a B paper that the Superintendent of Lights and Lines provides us with a cost estimate as to what that study would cost.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=12498.192s">But</a>  the more stories like yours are told, not just here but perhaps more importantly in the UAE, in the Middle East more generally, the more they're disseminated on social media in a way that's much harder to control than conventional media, doesn't there come a point where it actually damages the country's interests and therefore it will be in their interest to change that?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_34]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=12516.403s">Yes,</a>  I think it does. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=12517.584s">And</a>  I think it's, you know, I think it's, you know, certainly when I came out and I set up the charity with a partner of mine, Radha Sterling, who had worked on cases like mine before, you know, like I said, we have a charity, Due Justice in Dubai. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=12529.457s">When</a>  we set that up, you know, one of the things that we want to do, as well as helping people there, is to raise the profile so we can say, you know, Dubai, you can change this. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=12538.307s">There</a>  is no reason to abuse and torture and have unfair trials. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=12542.993s">I</a>  mean it might benefit you in the short term in terms of your local businesses and your local families. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=12547.939s">So</a>  you're an optimist but you're still very angry? <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=12550.323s">I'm</a>  very angry from my side but I'm an optimist and to be honest I would like to go there and help them change.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=13003.625s">Yes,</a>  we'd drop off into the deep ocean somewhere like the Grand Banks, for example. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=13007.068s">Then</a>  we'd go across some deep ocean there, where there's the wreck of the Titanic, of course, at 3,800 metres.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_36]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=14051.419s">And</a>  then the women dream of fishing permits, fishing rights. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=14054.981s">And</a>  the greatest dream of all is of an abalone farm. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=14058.042s">Yes,</a>  the women dream of their own community aquaculture business, an abalone farm.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_32]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=14067.798s">just</a>  about a kilometer away is Simonstown and that is where my family was forced removed in the late 1960s to an area called Ocean View. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=14083.087s">Grandfather</a>  was a fisherman and my grandmother was a fisherwoman. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=14088.83s">And</a>  also growing up in a fishing community, fishing area, the community and fishing has always been part of <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=14096.895s">of</a>  my life and growing up.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=14549.862s">political</a>  future. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=14551.343s">Mr.</a>  Mnangagwe, seen by many as a new hope, has been a close ally of Mr. Mugabe for decades, with a reputation as a hardliner. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=14559.948s">Priscilla</a>  Misihirabwe Mushonga, an MP for the opposition Movement for Democratic Change party, says she's concerned over the role of ZANU-PF in a future government.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_29]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=14570.787s">Some</a>  of us feel that those that are in ZANU-PF really need to do an introspection, because if they kept this man, even after he had done the kind of atrocities that he did, I worry whether they will be the kind of people who will turn a leaf and really deliver to the people of Zimbabwe a democratic country. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=14591.44s">That</a>  concerns me, and that worries me.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=14594.6s">The</a>  Lebanese Prime Minister, Saad Hariri, has arrived back in Beirut after he shocked the country by announcing his resignation in Saudi Arabia two and a half weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=14603.984s">Mr.</a>  Hariri's supporters celebrated in the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=14611.207s">Saad</a>  Hariri is expected to make clear later if he intends to reaffirm his resignation. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=14616.729s">Many</a>  Lebanese believe Saudi Arabia pressured him</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_30]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=15068.208s">I</a>  don't remember driving as fast as that day back to Santiago. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=15072.932s">And</a>  I remember going through these internal contradictions. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=15075.955s">On</a>  one hand, I thought that he had already been killed. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=15079.178s">Then,</a>  all of a sudden, you would sort of have this sense of hope and think, OK, no, he's still alive, and at the same time wish that if they are going to kill him, they better kill him soon so he doesn't suffer.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=15093.07s">In</a>  fact, it was 36 years before you had confirmation that your father was dead, when some fragments of bone that were found in a mine were found to be his. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=15104.36s">What</a>  was it like living for so long without information?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_30]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=15556.887s">deciding</a>  for me and my children's future. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=15559.709s">But</a>  I was determined to not let Pinochet defeat me. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=15563.372s">I</a>  was going to defeat him.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=15566.194s">What</a>  kind of justice did you get for your husband?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_30]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=15572.179s">I'm</a>  very aware that it was some sort of justice, probably not the ideal one, not everything that we were hoping to get, but it was also what was possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=15581.725s">We</a>  had to be realistic. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=15583.566s">You</a>  have to bear in mind that when the truth about his case came out, it was actually the first crime in which we were able to find out everything that happened from the moment when they were detained until they were executed.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_40]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=16053.628s">The</a>  past few years, he's been constantly on the move around the U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=16057.851s">Usually</a>  he only stays in a city for a few weeks, but he likes L.A.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_26]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=16061.934s">I</a>  chose to stay this long this time because there was more to do, more people to talk to.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_40]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=16067.118s">You</a>  have a lot more music to play?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_26]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=16069.02s">I've</a>  got a lot of music up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=16070.581s">25</a>  years of it, so I've got to give it to somebody.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_40]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=16077.301s">On</a>  a good day, Shaver has made a hundred bucks in one sitting, but usually he makes enough to buy himself a meal. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=16084.185s">His</a>  favorite meal, breakfast.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_26]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=16086.146s">I</a>  usually make enough to get one solid meal, a couple of snacks.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_40]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=16089.988s">After</a>  playing at Union Station, we walk across the street to a diner.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_26]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=16094.53s">I'd</a>  like all you can eat pancakes, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_40]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=16096.592s">He</a>  likes to share whatever money he makes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_26]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=16098.453s">What</a>  do you want Jerry?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_40]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=16102.615s">Today,</a>  he wants to treat his friend Jerry to breakfast. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=16112.038s">As</a>  he eats his pancakes, he tells me what it would be like if he had a home. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=16116.16s">He</a>  would cook. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=16117.32s">He</a>  would make origami. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=16118.901s">He</a>  likes to make roses.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_26]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=16119.921s">He</a>  could get permanent supportive housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=16121.942s">He</a>  says he's on six lists.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_40]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=16129.526s">But</a>  he always has one stipulation, a piano nearby.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_38]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=16584.16s">can't</a>  swallow, so therefore they had to put a cuff inside the throat to stop saliva going down into his lungs. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=16592.791s">They'd</a>  given him this tracheotomy, he was on this machine, because we get a very high fever, so they'd had to cover him in ice. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=16599.5s">So</a>  no, it wasn't very jolly.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=16601.897s">Robin</a>  was paralyzed from the neck down and unable to breathe without a mechanical pump. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=16608.219s">He</a>  wasn't able to speak for a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=16610.2s">Diana</a>  gave birth to their son without him there and remembers introducing them.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_38]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=16615.362s">Well,</a>  I took him in to see Robin and, you know, didn't get much. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=16620.504s">Not</a>  surprising, not much reaction really. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=16623.685s">Not</a>  surprising. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=16625.445s">He</a>  was still really very ill. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=16627.428s">He</a>  was totally paralyzed and didn't really know what was going on and you know all that sort of thing.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_37]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=16633.495s">The</a>  family flew back to England from Kenya and Robin was moved into a new hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=16638.701s">It</a>  looked like he might never leave.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_38]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=16641.204s">I</a>  think probably the depression set in afterwards when he</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=17092.789s">with</a>  three bedrooms with sort of intensive care standard care for severely disabled people to go on holiday.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=17113.884s">Well,</a>  it was really when he started having terrible bleeds and he was weakening. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=17119.625s">Simply</a>  the effect of being in a wheelchair and unable to move all those years, the wear and tear on his body, but also on the inside of him as well, was very, very considerable. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=17132.408s">And</a>  he definitely got, he got weaker and at a certain point the quality of life that my mother and he had built up and enjoyed over all those years was no longer there.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_38]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=17168.022s">I</a>  decided before I saw it the first time that I was going to adopt a very</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_33]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=17621.469s">the</a>  drummer for the Beach Boys, Dennis Wilson, who helped Manson record his first track.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=17626.312s">♪</a>  Cease to exist ♪ Just come and say you love me ♪ Give up your world ♪ Come on, you can't be</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=17648.177s">He</a>  was a frustrated singer-guitarist, a pseudo-philosopher, a megalomaniac. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=17654.261s">But</a>  more importantly than anything else, he was an evil, sophisticated conman who cleverly hid behind the common image of a hippie, that of being peace-loving. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=17665.189s">But</a>  he was not peace-loving. <a href="https://youtu.be/W1Pcx_tDASA&t=17667.631s">He</a>  had a passion and a lust for death and murder.</p>
