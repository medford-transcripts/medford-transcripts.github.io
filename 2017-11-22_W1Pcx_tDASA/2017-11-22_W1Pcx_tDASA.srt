1

[SPEAKER_25]: 36th regular meeting of the Medford City Council.

2
00:09:39,398 --> 00:09:41,599
[SPEAKER_25]: November 21st, 2017.

3
00:09:41,659 --> 00:09:43,100
[SPEAKER_25]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

4
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,101
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Dello Russo?

5
00:09:45,121 --> 00:09:45,881
Present.

6
00:09:46,421 --> 00:09:47,302
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Falco?

7
00:09:47,322 --> 00:09:47,602
[SPEAKER_21]: Present.

8
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:49,043
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Knight?

9
00:09:49,163 --> 00:09:49,463
[SPEAKER_21]: Present.

10
00:09:50,103 --> 00:09:51,004
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Locker?

11
00:09:52,064 --> 00:09:52,264
[SPEAKER_21]: Present.

12
00:09:52,284 --> 00:09:52,944
[SPEAKER_21]: Vice President Marks?

13
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:53,605
[SPEAKER_18]: Present.

14
00:09:54,205 --> 00:09:55,106
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Scarpelli?

15
00:09:55,466 --> 00:09:55,686
[SPEAKER_21]: Present.

16
00:09:56,486 --> 00:09:57,206
[SPEAKER_21]: President Cameo?

17
00:09:57,507 --> 00:09:57,847
[SPEAKER_21]: Present.

18
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:00,833
[SPEAKER_25]: Please rise and salute the flag.

19
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:12,316
[SPEAKER_25]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

20
00:10:13,837 --> 00:10:15,237
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Lococo.

21
00:10:15,277 --> 00:10:17,458
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

22
00:10:17,498 --> 00:10:20,058
[SPEAKER_09]: Just asking to suspend the rules to take 17765, 17763,

23
00:10:27,938 --> 00:10:31,301
[SPEAKER_09]: and then obviously the petition from Eversource, and I believe we have one more.

24
00:10:31,321 --> 00:10:35,504
[SPEAKER_25]: All in the motion by Councilor Lungo-Koehn for suspension of the rules, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo.

25
00:10:35,544 --> 00:10:36,185
[SPEAKER_25]: All those in favor?

26
00:10:36,926 --> 00:10:37,806
[SPEAKER_25]: Motion passes.

27
00:10:37,826 --> 00:10:40,649
[SPEAKER_25]: 17, seven, six, five.

28
00:10:40,949 --> 00:10:41,269
[SPEAKER_25]: Five.

29
00:10:41,769 --> 00:10:49,436
[SPEAKER_25]: Petition by Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street, Medford, to address the council on do zoning laws apply in Medford.

30
00:10:50,136 --> 00:10:51,758
[SPEAKER_25]: Good evening, name and address for the record, please.

31
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:54,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, Cheryl Rodriguez, 21 Park Street.

32
00:10:54,715 --> 00:10:55,496
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for taking me.

33
00:10:55,937 --> 00:10:57,540
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm having a little bronchitis, so.

34
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:02,243
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just wanted to start with a notification.

35
00:11:02,904 --> 00:11:13,505
[SPEAKER_05]: If you live on or near Bellevue Street, Capon Street, Fairmont Street, University Avenue, or Winthrop Street, please be advised that Tufts University intends to convert these properties there into dormitories.

36
00:11:13,525 --> 00:11:18,246
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no further details on this project and have just heard about them.

37
00:11:18,346 --> 00:11:22,327
[SPEAKER_05]: The ZBA meeting for their variances is on Monday, December 4th at 7 p.m.

38
00:11:22,407 --> 00:11:23,527
[SPEAKER_05]: here in Council Chambers.

39
00:11:24,327 --> 00:11:28,648
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless you are an abutter or an abutter to an abutter, you will not be notified of this meeting.

40
00:11:31,229 --> 00:11:37,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Sadly, I'm here again to speak on the gross negligence of our Zoning Board of Appeals with regards to the 87 Medford Street Project.

41
00:11:38,011 --> 00:11:46,734
[SPEAKER_05]: After the October 25th meeting, I and another resident filed a complaint with the Attorney General for violation of open meeting laws and not allowing residents to speak.

42
00:11:47,494 --> 00:11:51,375
[SPEAKER_05]: Two subsequent complaints were filed after the November 13th meeting.

43
00:11:52,276 --> 00:11:57,938
[SPEAKER_05]: I also included in my complaint that our Zoning Board members seem to not understand what their job and limitations are.

44
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:08,476
[SPEAKER_05]: They are not permitted to create new zoning laws on a parcel-by-parcel basis through variances, which is essentially spot zoning, and frankly are not allowed to create new zoning laws at all.

45
00:12:09,037 --> 00:12:10,941
[SPEAKER_05]: That is the job of the Medford City Council.

46
00:12:12,297 --> 00:12:23,463
[SPEAKER_05]: In the presence of dozens of residents and four sitting city councilors, a member of the ZBA in October stated that the board was forced to grant illegal variances because the Medford City Council has not changed zoning.

47
00:12:23,723 --> 00:12:28,845
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not true, and I again ask this council to set the record straight that this is not in their purview.

48
00:12:29,426 --> 00:12:33,328
[SPEAKER_05]: Variances should be rare and only under legally allowed conditions.

49
00:12:34,468 --> 00:12:42,856
[SPEAKER_05]: These developers time and time again express surprise when they meet resistance to their projects as they say they are being encouraged by the administration to build denser.

50
00:12:43,477 --> 00:12:45,779
[SPEAKER_05]: This council needs to find out where that message is coming from.

51
00:12:46,059 --> 00:12:47,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it the Office of Community Development?

52
00:12:47,861 --> 00:12:51,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Whoever it is, why are they encouraging developers to ignore zoning laws?

53
00:12:52,305 --> 00:12:56,929
[SPEAKER_05]: Because projects with nine plus variances aren't bending zoning laws, they're pretending they don't exist.

54
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:15,461
[SPEAKER_05]: According to the Medford Zoning Ordinances, Chapter 94, Section 173, entitled General Dimensional Requirements, Table 6.3, titled Table of Dimensional Requirements, this project is so grossly outsized for the property provided that it was illegal for it to have passed.

55
00:13:16,682 --> 00:13:33,413
[SPEAKER_05]: A multi-dwelling, which is as close as this mixed use which is not allowed, requires 10,000 square feet to start, 4,500 square feet for the first two units, then 1,000 square feet for each additional unit on floors one through three, 600 square feet for each unit on floors four and above.

56
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:42,699
[SPEAKER_05]: By this math, the size of the property is about 45,000 square feet and they're only legally permitted to build 32 units as the housing doesn't begin until the second level.

57
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:46,521
[SPEAKER_05]: If the housing began at the first level, they would only be allowed to build 31.

58
00:13:46,561 --> 00:13:48,621
[SPEAKER_05]: The project approved was 55.

59
00:13:50,441 --> 00:13:51,301
[SPEAKER_05]: Let that sink in.

60
00:13:51,721 --> 00:13:57,062
[SPEAKER_05]: A full 23 units over allowable density if this project was legally allowed to be there.

61
00:13:57,762 --> 00:14:03,583
[SPEAKER_05]: To put that into perspective, the developer threatened if this project didn't go through, he would build a 40B there.

62
00:14:04,163 --> 00:14:06,004
[SPEAKER_05]: I counted that a 40B might be smaller.

63
00:14:07,024 --> 00:14:12,345
[SPEAKER_05]: 40B projects would also provide 25% affordable units instead of the six provided here.

64
00:14:13,045 --> 00:14:17,088
[SPEAKER_05]: but they are legally allowed to go outside the zoning laws, but likely not as far as this.

65
00:14:18,209 --> 00:14:31,921
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though this project is illegal for the sake of argument, even 30% outside of our zoning of 40B would only be 42 units, with at least 10 of those units being affordable, still 13 less than were legally approved by our zoning board.

66
00:14:32,862 --> 00:14:41,950
[SPEAKER_05]: That evidence removes all arguments that this is done to increase affordable housing because it adds 49 luxury price units and only six affordable units.

67
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:44,652
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a density project and nothing more.

68
00:14:45,273 --> 00:14:46,834
[SPEAKER_05]: The approval of the project was illegal.

69
00:14:47,355 --> 00:14:52,859
[SPEAKER_05]: It shows a fundamental lack of understanding of our zoning laws and the boundaries of the powers of the ZBA.

70
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:58,604
[SPEAKER_05]: It also runs contrary to the reasons that they stated for breaking our zoning laws without remorse.

71
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:01,007
[SPEAKER_05]: The entire board should be removed.

72
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:03,249
[SPEAKER_05]: The decision should be immediately overturned.

73
00:15:03,689 --> 00:15:12,859
[SPEAKER_05]: When a new board is installed, they should be made to watch the open meeting law tapes the Attorney General ordered the board to watch after their last violation of open meeting law.

74
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:20,967
[SPEAKER_05]: They should also be made to read Massachusetts General Law section 40A, paying particular attention to section 10 entitled variances.

75
00:15:21,688 --> 00:15:35,080
[SPEAKER_05]: These are the only way that this board can legally grant variances, not based on a density agenda, not based on the will of the administration, and definitely not because they feel responsible for solving the greater Boston housing crisis.

76
00:15:37,763 --> 00:15:42,287
[SPEAKER_05]: Yesterday, the meeting of the open meeting law complaints was held by the ZBA at 8.45 a.m.

77
00:15:43,328 --> 00:15:46,931
[SPEAKER_05]: The board affirmed that they feel they are fighting against this council for a greater good.

78
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:53,481
[SPEAKER_05]: It was again stated that they are forced to grant variances because this council has an updated zoning.

79
00:15:54,261 --> 00:16:01,803
[SPEAKER_05]: Further, it was said that even if this council asks them to expand who they notify for projects, they will refuse to do so.

80
00:16:02,383 --> 00:16:12,466
[SPEAKER_05]: They said they will follow the letter of the Massachusetts law and only notify abutters to abutters within 300 feet and only residents directly across the street from the project.

81
00:16:13,426 --> 00:16:18,012
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the complainants was from a resident who was across the street from the project and one house over.

82
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:20,515
[SPEAKER_05]: She complained that she was not notified.

83
00:16:21,015 --> 00:16:28,284
[SPEAKER_05]: The ZBA says they are under no obligation to notify her and will not notify people similarly in the future.

84
00:16:29,105 --> 00:16:31,888
[SPEAKER_05]: This project will impact her as much as her next door neighbor.

85
00:16:32,789 --> 00:16:37,973
[SPEAKER_05]: This was highlighted and they asked Solicitor Rumley to back them in this interpretation of the law.

86
00:16:38,993 --> 00:16:48,059
[SPEAKER_05]: This board has consulted with our city solicitor and has made it clear that they intend to do the minimum and will not do more even if an ordinance is passed by this council.

87
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,821
[SPEAKER_05]: The time has passed to talk here at meetings.

88
00:16:50,921 --> 00:16:52,882
[SPEAKER_05]: This is happening and accelerating quickly.

89
00:16:53,363 --> 00:17:00,788
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a ZBA that is moving to increase density through variances and refusing to be checked other than through the filing of court cases.

90
00:17:02,587 --> 00:17:14,251
[SPEAKER_05]: I asked Solicitor Rumley if there was a board I could appeal to that would help, since the ZBA is going outside of zoning and refusing to follow the laws on granting variances, and he angrily told me to hire an attorney.

91
00:17:15,371 --> 00:17:17,171
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently that is our only recourse.

92
00:17:17,992 --> 00:17:19,192
[SPEAKER_05]: But you need to do it quickly.

93
00:17:19,212 --> 00:17:28,755
[SPEAKER_05]: This last illegal approval allowed density that was 70% more than what is allowed for a parcel of this size in the city of Medford.

94
00:17:29,888 --> 00:17:32,069
[SPEAKER_05]: It provides zero setbacks.

95
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:39,554
[SPEAKER_05]: Even if zoning was completely modified tomorrow, it is doubtful that a project like this would have been allowed.

96
00:17:40,154 --> 00:17:51,461
[SPEAKER_05]: If you update zoning to allow more density and the ZBA still feels that it isn't dense enough, we'll stop them from approving projects 70% over what you make in the new laws.

97
00:17:52,693 --> 00:17:55,636
[SPEAKER_05]: You've lost complete control of our zoning laws.

98
00:17:55,696 --> 00:17:57,218
[SPEAKER_05]: The time to play nice is over.

99
00:17:58,098 --> 00:18:01,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Our ZBA is doing as they see fit with regard to zoning laws.

100
00:18:01,722 --> 00:18:07,027
[SPEAKER_05]: Our Mayor is meeting with people behind closed doors to write zoning laws the way she wants them to be.

101
00:18:07,428 --> 00:18:09,430
[SPEAKER_05]: Where is the City Council in this conversation?

102
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:11,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Where is the resident input?

103
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:13,044
[SPEAKER_05]: This is your area.

104
00:18:13,204 --> 00:18:14,465
[SPEAKER_05]: This is under your control.

105
00:18:15,006 --> 00:18:17,188
[SPEAKER_05]: You have far more power than to make a speech.

106
00:18:17,668 --> 00:18:18,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Please use it.

107
00:18:18,829 --> 00:18:20,351
[SPEAKER_05]: The residents are counting on you.

108
00:18:21,011 --> 00:18:25,436
[SPEAKER_05]: You saw that the ZBA only allowed you to speak at the Medford Street Project in October.

109
00:18:26,156 --> 00:18:30,060
[SPEAKER_05]: And all that you spoke was to say to let the residents speak, which they did not.

110
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,882
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to speak for us now.

111
00:18:32,863 --> 00:18:34,744
[SPEAKER_05]: In 18 months, it will be too late.

112
00:18:35,545 --> 00:18:36,805
[SPEAKER_05]: You've all retained your seats.

113
00:18:37,225 --> 00:18:38,806
[SPEAKER_05]: You can all start the work now.

114
00:18:39,386 --> 00:18:43,187
[SPEAKER_05]: I encourage you to retain an attorney versus loaning laws to help you with this.

115
00:18:43,687 --> 00:18:47,227
[SPEAKER_05]: Not just a group that's charged with increasing density in cities.

116
00:18:47,768 --> 00:18:49,228
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to reign in this board.

117
00:18:49,548 --> 00:18:50,768
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to take control.

118
00:18:51,648 --> 00:18:53,029
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you going to do about this project?

119
00:18:53,529 --> 00:18:57,069
[SPEAKER_05]: It's now passed and the only way to stop it is to file a lawsuit.

120
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:59,270
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that how it's going to work here in Medford?

121
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:04,986
[SPEAKER_05]: Either you stop gross overreach or the city continues to sue itself over and over again.

122
00:19:05,006 --> 00:19:06,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.

123
00:19:15,057 --> 00:19:15,397
[SPEAKER_17]: Good evening.

124
00:19:15,417 --> 00:19:16,438
[SPEAKER_17]: Name and address of the record, please.

125
00:19:16,618 --> 00:19:16,958
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

126
00:19:16,978 --> 00:19:18,700
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, my name is Ken Krause.

127
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,481
[SPEAKER_17]: I live at 50 Mystic Street.

128
00:19:21,482 --> 00:19:34,351
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not speaking on behalf of Tufts University, but I just wanted to share some information for people who might be here or watching about the items that were mentioned coming up on December 4th at the zoning board.

129
00:19:35,151 --> 00:19:42,056
[SPEAKER_17]: I saw the public notices in the transcript last week for 13 single-family homes that Tufts intends to

130
00:19:43,437 --> 00:19:47,501
[SPEAKER_17]: convert to housing for upper level students.

131
00:19:47,881 --> 00:19:56,890
[SPEAKER_17]: Just for a little bit of background, again, I didn't bring my notes or anything or come prepared to speak on this, but I called the community relations office when I saw that because I was curious as to what that entails.

132
00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:02,715
[SPEAKER_17]: So briefly, Tufts requires their freshmen and sophomores to live on campus.

133
00:20:03,376 --> 00:20:07,319
[SPEAKER_17]: About 50% of the junior students study abroad.

134
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:15,388
[SPEAKER_17]: Tufts has found when those students come back, they don't want to live in conventional dormitories with a bunch of freshman and sophomore type students.

135
00:20:15,808 --> 00:20:27,019
[SPEAKER_17]: So they're looking to provide housing for the upper level junior and senior students in another setting that's more typical to apartment living.

136
00:20:28,065 --> 00:20:39,350
[SPEAKER_17]: Tufts owns 13 buildings on the streets that were mentioned, Winthrop, Fairmount, I forget the other two names, University Avenue, including a building that houses the Community Relations Office, and they're going to be moved.

137
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:40,811
[SPEAKER_25]: I think they own all but I think three.

138
00:20:41,151 --> 00:20:41,471
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.

139
00:20:41,511 --> 00:20:42,412
[SPEAKER_17]: So they're currently.

140
00:20:43,532 --> 00:20:49,857
[SPEAKER_17]: wooden homes on the streets and they're going to remain wooden homes.

141
00:20:50,738 --> 00:20:59,406
[SPEAKER_17]: Instead of being on the open market, Tufts rents them now, they're going to be offered to students through the housing program that they offer their students.

142
00:20:59,426 --> 00:21:03,789
[SPEAKER_17]: So I just wanted to share some of that because if people heard they're going to

143
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:13,438
[SPEAKER_17]: change these streets into dormitories and think there's going to be bulldozing of those streets and all those residents that are there.

144
00:21:13,498 --> 00:21:14,599
[SPEAKER_17]: That's not the plan.

145
00:21:14,659 --> 00:21:16,900
[SPEAKER_17]: I encourage people to come on December 4th.

146
00:21:18,602 --> 00:21:22,245
[SPEAKER_17]: The Community Relations Office indicated they've already spoke to the mayor.

147
00:21:22,285 --> 00:21:23,426
[SPEAKER_17]: They've spoken to each of you.

148
00:21:23,466 --> 00:21:25,448
[SPEAKER_17]: They've talked to many of the abutters.

149
00:21:26,649 --> 00:21:29,751
[SPEAKER_17]: Many of the abutters are absentee landlords and

150
00:21:31,984 --> 00:21:40,851
[SPEAKER_17]: Their situation is different than you might typically anticipate when you encounter neighbors.

151
00:21:41,631 --> 00:21:46,675
[SPEAKER_17]: But it sounds like they're doing the right thing in terms of the outreach.

152
00:21:46,715 --> 00:21:48,897
[SPEAKER_17]: And just in a nutshell, that's what they're planning.

153
00:21:48,957 --> 00:21:52,600
[SPEAKER_17]: So I encourage people to learn more about this project.

154
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,545
[SPEAKER_17]: December 4th at 7 o'clock, I believe, is the Zoning Board of Appeals hearing.

155
00:21:59,185 --> 00:21:59,465
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

156
00:21:59,485 --> 00:21:59,886
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. Cross.

157
00:22:01,735 --> 00:22:03,936
[SPEAKER_25]: All right, any further discussion on that?

158
00:22:03,956 --> 00:22:07,178
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, motion to receive and place on file?

159
00:22:08,378 --> 00:22:09,139
[SPEAKER_25]: By Councilor.

160
00:22:10,419 --> 00:22:14,301
[SPEAKER_25]: Motion by Councilor Dello Russo to receive and place on file, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

161
00:22:14,701 --> 00:22:15,301
[SPEAKER_25]: All those in favor?

162
00:22:15,962 --> 00:22:16,162
[SPEAKER_25]: Sorry?

163
00:22:17,563 --> 00:22:19,623
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Knight has requested a roll call vote.

164
00:22:19,664 --> 00:22:21,104
[SPEAKER_25]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

165
00:22:27,487 --> 00:22:28,408
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Dello Russo?

166
00:22:28,948 --> 00:22:29,328
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

167
00:22:29,928 --> 00:22:30,469
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Falco?

168
00:22:30,489 --> 00:22:30,609
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

169
00:22:31,539 --> 00:22:32,460
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Knight.

170
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:32,540
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

171
00:22:33,401 --> 00:22:34,282
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Kerr.

172
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:34,803
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

173
00:22:36,064 --> 00:22:36,805
[SPEAKER_21]: Vice President Marks.

174
00:22:36,965 --> 00:22:37,246
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

175
00:22:37,866 --> 00:22:38,627
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Scarpelli.

176
00:22:38,868 --> 00:22:39,108
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

177
00:22:39,128 --> 00:22:40,409
[SPEAKER_21]: Vice President Caraviello.

178
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:40,750
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

179
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:43,013
[SPEAKER_25]: Seven in the affirmative and a negative.

180
00:22:43,939 --> 00:22:45,700
[SPEAKER_25]: Motion passes.

181
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:56,486
[SPEAKER_25]: 17763, protection by Marianne Ducey to Nott Street, Medford, Mass., to address the Council about non-notification to residents about the Green Line meeting on November 20th, 2007.

182
00:22:56,906 --> 00:22:57,747
[SPEAKER_25]: Good evening.

183
00:22:57,767 --> 00:22:58,167
[SPEAKER_25]: Good evening.

184
00:22:58,327 --> 00:22:59,568
[SPEAKER_25]: Name and address for the record, please.

185
00:22:59,808 --> 00:23:01,769
[SPEAKER_15]: Marianne Ducey to Nott Street, Medford.

186
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:02,389
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

187
00:23:04,293 --> 00:23:06,676
[SPEAKER_15]: There was a meeting last night of the Green Line.

188
00:23:07,417 --> 00:23:11,403
[SPEAKER_15]: They're talking now about Route 16 again.

189
00:23:13,206 --> 00:23:20,957
[SPEAKER_15]: There wasn't any public notification of that to abutters for the most part or the adjacent neighborhood.

190
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:27,287
[SPEAKER_15]: I found out accidentally a neighbor, I don't have a computer, I don't have email.

191
00:23:27,688 --> 00:23:36,010
[SPEAKER_15]: So a neighbor started on email but it was conversations between two proponents of this talking about the meeting and the notice.

192
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:39,530
[SPEAKER_15]: So the neighbor brought it down to me and asked me if I knew about this.

193
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:40,131
[SPEAKER_15]: I said no.

194
00:23:40,251 --> 00:23:44,712
[SPEAKER_15]: So I decided to knock on a few doors to find out if anybody else knew.

195
00:23:46,252 --> 00:23:48,373
[SPEAKER_15]: Long and the short of it is I knocked on 150 doors.

196
00:23:50,683 --> 00:23:52,063
[SPEAKER_15]: Passed out 90 flyers.

197
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:54,944
[SPEAKER_15]: For the most part, people were not informed.

198
00:23:56,525 --> 00:24:01,766
[SPEAKER_15]: And those that were informed found out, as I said, through Facebook or some other communications.

199
00:24:02,286 --> 00:24:10,769
[SPEAKER_15]: But most people thought that the Route 16 part was going to be on hold until they finished the College Ave portion.

200
00:24:10,829 --> 00:24:13,329
[SPEAKER_15]: The College Ave portion is going to be completed in 2021.

201
00:24:13,709 --> 00:24:15,650
[SPEAKER_15]: They're already starting to do some work.

202
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:18,711
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if any of you have been down there, but they are doing some work.

203
00:24:21,503 --> 00:24:26,247
[SPEAKER_15]: I spoke to the DOT last night, the head of the DOT, and explained this to him.

204
00:24:27,068 --> 00:24:29,029
[SPEAKER_15]: And he had said, oh, it was a good turnout tonight.

205
00:24:29,109 --> 00:24:32,812
[SPEAKER_15]: I said, yeah, you have me to thank, because I knocked on 150 doors.

206
00:24:33,553 --> 00:24:35,615
[SPEAKER_15]: So he was surprised at that.

207
00:24:36,696 --> 00:24:41,980
[SPEAKER_15]: So we got both sides of the picture last night, because usually at these meetings, the proponent group is pretty organized.

208
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,982
[SPEAKER_15]: And they call each other and say, show up.

209
00:24:45,883 --> 00:24:56,901
[SPEAKER_15]: But the abutters and the elderly people and the people who don't have email and the people who are just not in line with this all or in the communication link, they don't know.

210
00:24:58,148 --> 00:24:59,990
[SPEAKER_15]: So this has got to change now.

211
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:02,092
[SPEAKER_15]: We've gone through this in the first phase.

212
00:25:02,592 --> 00:25:04,214
[SPEAKER_15]: There was a lot of this non-notification.

213
00:25:04,234 --> 00:25:14,944
[SPEAKER_15]: In fact, I have a letter that I wrote in 2012 complaining about this very same issue, which you can have a copy of, which substantiates that this is a pattern.

214
00:25:16,025 --> 00:25:19,227
[SPEAKER_15]: They kind of like have a subculture.

215
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:24,149
[SPEAKER_15]: They, you know, they speak amongst themselves, but the ones who are most directly infected are out of the loop.

216
00:25:24,229 --> 00:25:28,491
[SPEAKER_15]: And we're afraid that by the time we find out about it, it's going to be too late to make any changes.

217
00:25:28,511 --> 00:25:33,673
[SPEAKER_15]: It may be already too late to make any changes, but we should have some input before this thing goes too far.

218
00:25:33,693 --> 00:25:37,655
[SPEAKER_15]: Let me see here.

219
00:25:40,892 --> 00:25:48,402
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, the neighbor that informed me called the Boston Globe, the Medford Transcript, neither of them had any kind of public notice posted.

220
00:25:49,003 --> 00:25:54,090
[SPEAKER_15]: I called a few of the city councilors who recommended that I come tonight, which I'm here.

221
00:25:56,873 --> 00:26:00,834
[SPEAKER_15]: at City Hall here, got a reverse 911 call.

222
00:26:01,774 --> 00:26:07,255
[SPEAKER_15]: So a reverse 911 went out Saturday night, although it was only two days before the meeting.

223
00:26:07,856 --> 00:26:09,996
[SPEAKER_15]: So if you had plans, you know, you were out of luck.

224
00:26:11,496 --> 00:26:15,997
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, I didn't like the idea that they scheduled this meeting on Thanksgiving week.

225
00:26:16,458 --> 00:26:18,058
[SPEAKER_15]: Even if you knew about it, people are busy.

226
00:26:18,878 --> 00:26:22,859
[SPEAKER_15]: And the response period, the comment period, is right after Thanksgiving.

227
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:25,000
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, people are busy over the holidays.

228
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,220
[SPEAKER_15]: They haven't got time to deal with this.

229
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:40,068
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's from past history and what they're doing now again, it's suppressing comments because they don't give people enough time to find out about this stuff and to send their comments in.

230
00:26:41,709 --> 00:26:47,133
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if all of you are aware what the plans were in the past, but about five or six years ago,

231
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:52,004
[SPEAKER_15]: The Metropolitan Planning Council came out and gave a presentation to the group.

232
00:26:52,885 --> 00:26:58,030
[SPEAKER_15]: And basically, they want to do economic development around the station.

233
00:26:59,211 --> 00:27:02,534
[SPEAKER_15]: The station is going to be sited somewhere in the vicinity of the U-Haul building.

234
00:27:03,335 --> 00:27:04,776
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, that's summable.

235
00:27:05,717 --> 00:27:09,982
[SPEAKER_15]: So any economic development that happens there, summable is going to get the benefit of that.

236
00:27:11,482 --> 00:27:15,844
[SPEAKER_15]: So the Metropolitan Planning Council said, well, maybe they could do some development in Medford.

237
00:27:15,864 --> 00:27:21,407
[SPEAKER_15]: They had suggested putting a row of retail stores along Auburn Street, where Whole Foods is now.

238
00:27:21,467 --> 00:27:24,328
[SPEAKER_15]: But if they do that, that's going to take away from Whole Foods parking lot.

239
00:27:25,108 --> 00:27:26,389
[SPEAKER_15]: So what would they do there?

240
00:27:26,409 --> 00:27:27,810
[SPEAKER_15]: Would they put a parking garage up?

241
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:35,154
[SPEAKER_15]: Then they suggested, well, you could probably put condo development where Walkwing Court is.

242
00:27:35,294 --> 00:27:37,335
[SPEAKER_15]: Not very high, maybe four or six stories.

243
00:27:37,895 --> 00:27:46,461
[SPEAKER_15]: But when they built Walkwing Court, they built it specifically to be two stories high because they wanted it to blend in with the surrounding neighborhood.

244
00:27:47,496 --> 00:27:55,143
[SPEAKER_15]: Plus, it would be displacing all those seniors and disabled people that live there now because they said that this would not be for seniors.

245
00:27:55,163 --> 00:27:56,804
[SPEAKER_15]: This wasn't going to be a senior complex.

246
00:27:57,084 --> 00:27:58,906
[SPEAKER_15]: It would be for, you know, the regular public.

247
00:28:00,007 --> 00:28:06,352
[SPEAKER_15]: So, I just can't, you know, cope with that because, I mean, you know, we don't need that there.

248
00:28:06,372 --> 00:28:08,854
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, you're going to displace seniors who like living there.

249
00:28:13,913 --> 00:28:25,672
[SPEAKER_15]: They wanted to site this station at Route 16, and the whole purpose of this transit here is because they hope to take cars off the road and get people onto transit.

250
00:28:26,488 --> 00:28:34,871
[SPEAKER_15]: However, if you put a station at Route 16, if any of you have traveled Route 16, any time of the day, a lot of traffic, always a lot of traffic.

251
00:28:35,211 --> 00:28:36,911
[SPEAKER_15]: But it's not traffic coming to Medford.

252
00:28:37,371 --> 00:28:38,452
[SPEAKER_15]: It's pass-through traffic.

253
00:28:38,492 --> 00:28:43,573
[SPEAKER_15]: It's traffic going to 93, it's going to Route 2, it's going to 28, it's going to 3.

254
00:28:44,934 --> 00:28:49,555
[SPEAKER_15]: So if you put a station there, that's not going to alleviate any of the Route 16 traffic.

255
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:55,992
[SPEAKER_15]: Matter of fact, it may bring more traffic if people come to the station that wouldn't ordinarily come here.

256
00:28:56,613 --> 00:29:00,455
[SPEAKER_15]: Plus, we have ample public transportation in the area.

257
00:29:00,755 --> 00:29:08,398
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a bus that goes to Lechmere, which may get taken off if they put the station here.

258
00:29:08,438 --> 00:29:13,701
[SPEAKER_15]: And they may say, you can get on the Lechmere line at either College Ave or Route 16.

259
00:29:14,321 --> 00:29:15,622
[SPEAKER_15]: Plus, we have Davis Square.

260
00:29:16,382 --> 00:29:17,623
[SPEAKER_15]: We have Harvard Square buses.

261
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:19,364
[SPEAKER_15]: We have the commuter rail.

262
00:29:20,598 --> 00:29:22,620
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, it's a short walk to Medford Square.

263
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,182
[SPEAKER_15]: You can get on other buses that go to Wellington and other places.

264
00:29:26,023 --> 00:29:28,386
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's not like we have no transportation.

265
00:29:29,547 --> 00:29:31,008
[SPEAKER_15]: Plus the cost of doing this.

266
00:29:31,128 --> 00:29:33,030
[SPEAKER_15]: We're talking about, they say a mile.

267
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:35,813
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that's the way, you know, if you measured it with a tape measure.

268
00:29:35,853 --> 00:29:41,798
[SPEAKER_15]: But people, like where I live on North Street, I can walk, to call it jab, in about 15 minutes.

269
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:43,900
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm a senior citizen.

270
00:29:44,791 --> 00:29:55,439
[SPEAKER_15]: So younger people got much faster than I. If you're going to come to Route 16 station with a bicycle, so you pedal a couple of more minutes and you get to College Ave, no big deal.

271
00:29:56,540 --> 00:30:06,628
[SPEAKER_15]: This is going to require rebuilding the North Street Bridge and the Winthrop Street Bridge because they're not high enough or wide enough underneath for the two sets of trains to go under.

272
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:10,311
[SPEAKER_15]: The North Street Bridge right now is very steep.

273
00:30:11,639 --> 00:30:15,580
[SPEAKER_15]: I was standing outside the polling place at Walkwing Court on election day.

274
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,961
[SPEAKER_15]: A guy came by with a baby carriage.

275
00:30:18,281 --> 00:30:20,122
[SPEAKER_15]: And I was asking him if he knew about this.

276
00:30:20,182 --> 00:30:21,562
[SPEAKER_15]: And he said, no, he didn't know about it.

277
00:30:21,582 --> 00:30:23,703
[SPEAKER_15]: And he said, I told him they have to rebuild this bridge.

278
00:30:24,083 --> 00:30:26,483
[SPEAKER_15]: And he says, I can't even push the baby carriage up the bridge now.

279
00:30:27,044 --> 00:30:28,524
[SPEAKER_15]: Another guy came by on a bicycle.

280
00:30:29,144 --> 00:30:31,725
[SPEAKER_15]: I told him, he says, I have trouble pedaling up the hill now.

281
00:30:32,605 --> 00:30:34,666
[SPEAKER_15]: And not to speak of the people who have to walk up the hill.

282
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:39,391
[SPEAKER_15]: So I don't know if it's going to be higher or what.

283
00:30:41,011 --> 00:30:46,232
[SPEAKER_15]: And living in the neighborhood, when they rebuilt those two bridges, it wasn't all that long ago.

284
00:30:47,033 --> 00:30:51,814
[SPEAKER_15]: It was a terrible inconvenience because all the streets around there have been made one way.

285
00:30:52,654 --> 00:30:58,375
[SPEAKER_15]: So the only way to exit from where I live would be in front of Whole Foods onto Route 16.

286
00:30:58,415 --> 00:31:01,256
[SPEAKER_15]: So you're putting more traffic onto Route 16 because you're closing the bridges.

287
00:31:02,196 --> 00:31:05,197
[SPEAKER_15]: I know it's only a temporary couple of years until they fix the bridge, but still.

288
00:31:09,661 --> 00:31:24,597
[SPEAKER_15]: So when you add up the cost of all this, can you cost justify that the expense that it's going to cost to put one more station at Route 16, that some of those are going to get the benefit of it, and the method's going to get the pain of it?

289
00:31:25,677 --> 00:31:26,618
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not gonna help us.

290
00:31:27,098 --> 00:31:35,684
[SPEAKER_15]: Now I know the mayor comes in various public meetings and she says she's all for it, but I'd like to know what's in it for Medford?

291
00:31:36,524 --> 00:31:37,645
[SPEAKER_15]: Why is she so for it?

292
00:31:38,165 --> 00:31:39,206
[SPEAKER_15]: We have to find that out.

293
00:31:42,308 --> 00:31:54,076
[SPEAKER_15]: The city mayor, you people, you have to have a listening session or a meeting with just the abutters and just the people in the immediate area to hear their concerns,

294
00:31:54,978 --> 00:32:04,067
[SPEAKER_15]: to look at their neighborhood, I would be happy to take all of you people on a little tour so you can see what, I mean, you know, it's one thing seeing it on paper.

295
00:32:04,307 --> 00:32:07,670
[SPEAKER_15]: It's another thing walking the route and see what we're talking about here.

296
00:32:08,831 --> 00:32:11,073
[SPEAKER_15]: I would, if the mayor's listening, you can come too.

297
00:32:11,614 --> 00:32:13,315
[SPEAKER_15]: You probably, you should benefit from this.

298
00:32:16,563 --> 00:32:20,146
[SPEAKER_15]: So, and premature, I think it's premature.

299
00:32:20,927 --> 00:32:28,933
[SPEAKER_15]: Finish college ed, you'll learn a lot probably if you finish college ed before you even consider Route 16, whether you want it or not.

300
00:32:30,834 --> 00:32:34,217
[SPEAKER_15]: So, I know the proponents of this are very enthusiastic.

301
00:32:34,277 --> 00:32:36,459
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not that I'm against public transportation.

302
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:38,601
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm for public transportation.

303
00:32:39,441 --> 00:32:43,545
[SPEAKER_15]: When it's justified, when it's cost effective, when it's going to be beneficial,

304
00:32:44,763 --> 00:32:47,844
[SPEAKER_15]: If it's going to do some good for the city, fine.

305
00:32:48,044 --> 00:32:51,445
[SPEAKER_15]: But I just, I mean, you just can't see it.

306
00:32:51,745 --> 00:32:59,228
[SPEAKER_15]: The city has to hear the other side of the story and pay attention, not shut us out of this whole process.

307
00:32:59,248 --> 00:33:02,689
[SPEAKER_15]: Because we've been shut out for the whole project, you might as well say.

308
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:08,451
[SPEAKER_15]: So basically, that's really all I want to say.

309
00:33:09,031 --> 00:33:12,332
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, if you have any questions, I can give you the past history.

310
00:33:45,537 --> 00:33:51,439
[SPEAKER_09]: to express your dissatisfaction with the notification policy.

311
00:33:51,619 --> 00:33:57,721
[SPEAKER_09]: I find it very frustrating myself when the neighborhood isn't notified of such an important meeting.

312
00:33:59,001 --> 00:34:01,182
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's something that goes on.

313
00:34:02,462 --> 00:34:05,245
[SPEAKER_09]: with a number of different things in this city, and it's unfortunate.

314
00:34:05,265 --> 00:34:11,291
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if that's the MBTA, but I think that the city, knowing of such a meeting, should have done a reverse 911 call.

315
00:34:11,331 --> 00:34:17,738
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, they did at the very end, but I think that was prompted by some conversation I had with one of the councilors here.

316
00:34:18,327 --> 00:34:26,948
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, and I think the comment period, like you mentioned, I believe the comment period on this is by Tuesday, November 28th at 5 p.m.

317
00:34:27,069 --> 00:34:32,569
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I mean, my first recommendation would be to reach out to the MBTA and ask them to extend that.

318
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:40,791
[SPEAKER_09]: That's basically comments are due immediately after, you know, the Thanksgiving holiday when a lot of people are away.

319
00:34:40,811 --> 00:34:46,972
[SPEAKER_15]: He didn't feel, last night he was just emphatically saying that that's the deadline, so he was, you know.

320
00:34:47,957 --> 00:34:51,959
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to take a vote tonight and just request that that be extended by another week or two.

321
00:34:52,039 --> 00:34:56,881
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think it hurts to allow public comment, whether you're for or against the extension.

322
00:34:56,921 --> 00:35:02,424
[SPEAKER_09]: I think public comment should be given a more extensive period of time to do that.

323
00:35:03,324 --> 00:35:15,390
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think a meeting with the abutters, whether the city council holds it or the mayor, I believe that we do need to know what the positives and negatives are, and we need to know the concerns so that we can help address them with the MBTA.

324
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:19,311
[SPEAKER_09]: So those are just two things I wanted to add.

325
00:35:19,512 --> 00:35:20,692
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we should vote on.

326
00:35:21,272 --> 00:35:28,416
[SPEAKER_09]: We want to make a request that the city holds a public hearing or a public meeting.

327
00:35:28,816 --> 00:35:30,577
[SPEAKER_25]: And extend the comment period?

328
00:35:30,757 --> 00:35:31,317
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes, please.

329
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:33,018
[SPEAKER_25]: Mr. Clark, do you have that?

330
00:35:33,198 --> 00:35:36,520
[SPEAKER_25]: The MBTA or the City of Medford.

331
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:38,440
[SPEAKER_09]: The MBTA or the City of Medford.

332
00:35:38,461 --> 00:35:40,541
[SPEAKER_25]: And the City of Medford hold a public hearing.

333
00:35:46,045 --> 00:35:47,427
[SPEAKER_25]: Public meeting, excuse me, public meeting.

334
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:51,672
[SPEAKER_09]: We want to hold a public meeting, that's one thing.

335
00:35:51,712 --> 00:36:02,104
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, Clerk Finn, we want to also ask that they extend the comment period by a week or two past the Tuesday, November 28 date that was written on the notice.

336
00:36:03,625 --> 00:36:10,988
[SPEAKER_09]: People have to comment to the Secretary of Energy and Environment Affairs, MEPA office, no later than 5 p.m.

337
00:36:11,048 --> 00:36:12,388
[SPEAKER_09]: on Tuesday, November 28th.

338
00:36:12,848 --> 00:36:23,652
[SPEAKER_09]: Can we request that that time period be extended, especially for those who just learned about this project during either the reverse 911 call or when you notified them by knocking on doors?

339
00:36:24,793 --> 00:36:25,053
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

340
00:36:26,662 --> 00:36:28,684
[SPEAKER_25]: On the motion, Micah.

341
00:36:28,704 --> 00:36:32,287
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you want a copy of this 2012, whatever I wrote?

342
00:36:32,327 --> 00:36:36,191
[SPEAKER_15]: Because it documents this to show you people that it's not a new problem.

343
00:36:37,392 --> 00:36:39,814
[SPEAKER_15]: I documented it in here that was lack of notification.

344
00:36:39,894 --> 00:36:41,756
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's an ongoing problem.

345
00:36:41,776 --> 00:36:44,078
[SPEAKER_15]: It goes back and forth.

346
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:46,220
[SPEAKER_15]: Sometimes they invite you, sometimes they don't.

347
00:36:47,662 --> 00:36:51,804
[SPEAKER_25]: If you'd like to give it to the messenger and he'll give it to the clerk to send along.

348
00:36:52,224 --> 00:36:52,805
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you very much.

349
00:36:52,885 --> 00:37:00,788
[SPEAKER_09]: I think just to close, I think we've all one time or another have voiced our frustration with this reverse 911 system.

350
00:37:00,848 --> 00:37:04,270
[SPEAKER_09]: We get notifications multiple times about

351
00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:25,653
[SPEAKER_09]: fund community events, which is great, but when you have such a serious meeting with regards to the MBTA or our last speaker who spoke about notification about zoning meetings, zoning board of appeals meetings, and nobody's getting notified, and we're not using that reverse 9-1-1 system, it's extremely frustrating.

352
00:37:27,074 --> 00:37:49,843
[SPEAKER_09]: This is just, I'm hearing it far too often from residents who should be the ones controlling the situations, controlling and having their voices heard, controlling development, controlling a number of different things in the city and we're not notifying them of important public information a neighborhood should know about.

353
00:37:49,863 --> 00:37:51,104
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

354
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,240
[SPEAKER_25]: Good evening.

355
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:58,321
[SPEAKER_25]: Name and address to the record, please.

356
00:37:58,821 --> 00:37:59,961
[SPEAKER_42]: My name is Anita Nagum.

357
00:38:00,102 --> 00:38:04,964
[SPEAKER_42]: I live on Norton Avenue in Medford, just off of North Street, near Walkland Court.

358
00:38:04,984 --> 00:38:07,725
[SPEAKER_42]: There are a couple of things I would like to add to what Mary Ann has just said.

359
00:38:08,866 --> 00:38:12,828
[SPEAKER_42]: First, as far as the notification, well, first let me start.

360
00:38:13,088 --> 00:38:21,312
[SPEAKER_42]: I contacted the Green Line Extension Project at MassDOT and asked that the comment period be extended.

361
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,660
[SPEAKER_42]: It took a week for someone to call me back.

362
00:38:25,301 --> 00:38:28,521
[SPEAKER_42]: I explained to him that abutters had not been notified.

363
00:38:28,561 --> 00:38:43,044
[SPEAKER_42]: And we are talking about people on Charnwood Orchard and Piggott who would actually have property taken, not to mention people as far away as I am, which is about 150 yards, who are legally considered abutters as well under, I believe, federal statute.

364
00:38:44,584 --> 00:38:45,464
[SPEAKER_42]: He said he'd get back to me.

365
00:38:45,564 --> 00:38:46,084
[SPEAKER_42]: He never did.

366
00:38:46,104 --> 00:38:49,985
[SPEAKER_42]: I put two requests or comments into the governor's office.

367
00:38:51,041 --> 00:38:55,684
[SPEAKER_42]: asking that this comment period be extended and I still have not received any response to that.

368
00:38:57,285 --> 00:39:12,053
[SPEAKER_42]: Concerning notification to residents, the MassDOT used an email list which was obtained from 2009 to 2015 about when the previous series of meetings was held.

369
00:39:13,494 --> 00:39:16,956
[SPEAKER_42]: People came in and voluntarily signed in on sheets.

370
00:39:17,416 --> 00:39:18,997
[SPEAKER_42]: If they put email addresses down,

371
00:39:21,601 --> 00:39:29,465
[SPEAKER_42]: that information was given to MassDOT and that was used to provide the only notification for this last meeting.

372
00:39:30,625 --> 00:39:37,909
[SPEAKER_42]: Previously, MassDOT, actually because they were trying to get federal funding, went and put flyers around

373
00:39:39,726 --> 00:39:47,049
[SPEAKER_42]: if not by mail, but I believe they usually went and actually put flyers on the houses of abutters to notify them of meetings.

374
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:57,974
[SPEAKER_42]: I, at the meeting yesterday, challenged them on their lack of notification, and the response was, well, we sent out an email that is completely unacceptable.

375
00:39:59,835 --> 00:40:08,519
[SPEAKER_42]: The reverse 911 is fine, but that was done by the city of Medford, not the state, and it was only done because Mary Ann happened to call.

376
00:40:09,209 --> 00:40:11,070
[SPEAKER_42]: and speak with one of the city councilors.

377
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:13,611
[SPEAKER_42]: In addition, that is not sufficient.

378
00:40:13,631 --> 00:40:20,294
[SPEAKER_42]: A lot of people, because of the overuse of the 9-1-1, reverse 9-1-1, have opted out.

379
00:40:21,114 --> 00:40:24,075
[SPEAKER_42]: Many people who have cell phones have never even opted in to begin with.

380
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:30,318
[SPEAKER_42]: There are many elderly residents who do not have email and would not know about this unless they were directly notified.

381
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:36,041
[SPEAKER_42]: The notification is unacceptable, and we need the city council to

382
00:40:37,036 --> 00:40:45,058
[SPEAKER_42]: advocate for us with MassDOT to get adequate notification about these issues.

383
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:47,699
[SPEAKER_42]: The situation is really unacceptable.

384
00:40:48,739 --> 00:40:57,061
[SPEAKER_42]: The third thing just about the general project is a federal environmental review was only done for the station up to College Avenue.

385
00:40:57,701 --> 00:41:04,623
[SPEAKER_42]: A federal environmental review was never done for the Route 16 station, and it was dropped before one was ever done, was done.

386
00:41:06,552 --> 00:41:15,755
[SPEAKER_42]: The MassDOT MBTA has filed a notice of project change, which would allow them to add the Route 16 station without a federal environmental review.

387
00:41:16,495 --> 00:41:23,677
[SPEAKER_42]: NEPA, National Environmental Protection Agency policy, is much more rigorous than the Massachusetts policy.

388
00:41:24,858 --> 00:41:31,940
[SPEAKER_42]: And I would hope that the city council would advocate on behalf of residents to require that

389
00:41:33,072 --> 00:41:36,795
[SPEAKER_42]: a review be done under NEPA national standards.

390
00:41:38,697 --> 00:41:42,821
[SPEAKER_42]: This is a backdoor way to try to get the project in without a federal review.

391
00:41:43,982 --> 00:41:48,906
[SPEAKER_42]: Because they're not asking for a federal review, they would not be eligible for federal funding.

392
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:51,108
[SPEAKER_42]: And if they ever wanted federal funding, they'd have to go back.

393
00:41:51,528 --> 00:41:53,049
[SPEAKER_42]: But that ought to be done at the beginning.

394
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:57,033
[SPEAKER_42]: It's really not acceptable to be doing this in this manner.

395
00:41:58,834 --> 00:41:59,075
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

396
00:41:59,095 --> 00:42:00,156
[SPEAKER_25]: Excuse me.

397
00:42:01,061 --> 00:42:03,182
[SPEAKER_25]: The clerk didn't get your name and address, so if you give it to him again.

398
00:42:03,222 --> 00:42:05,082
[SPEAKER_42]: Anita Nagum, N-A-G-E-M.

399
00:42:05,203 --> 00:42:07,143
[SPEAKER_25]: And your address also?

400
00:42:07,163 --> 00:42:08,204
[SPEAKER_42]: Excuse me?

401
00:42:08,304 --> 00:42:08,784
[SPEAKER_25]: Your address.

402
00:42:09,104 --> 00:42:09,764
[SPEAKER_42]: 9 Norton Avenue.

403
00:42:09,784 --> 00:42:12,365
[SPEAKER_42]: 9 what?

404
00:42:12,385 --> 00:42:13,466
[SPEAKER_42]: 9 Norton Avenue.

405
00:42:13,586 --> 00:42:14,146
[SPEAKER_25]: 9 Norton Avenue.

406
00:42:14,226 --> 00:42:14,626
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

407
00:42:15,766 --> 00:42:16,147
[SPEAKER_25]: Good evening.

408
00:42:16,167 --> 00:42:17,167
[SPEAKER_25]: Name and address of the record, please.

409
00:42:18,287 --> 00:42:22,389
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, Doug Carr, 124 Boston Avenue, West Medford.

410
00:42:22,429 --> 00:42:24,350
[SPEAKER_07]: I was at the Green Line meeting as well last night.

411
00:42:26,683 --> 00:42:43,720
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree with the preceding folks about the lack of communication about this meeting, but honestly, this is a symptom of a larger problem that Medford has had for a long time, which is a consistent lack of competent planning in this city.

412
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:44,901
[SPEAKER_07]: We do not have enough people.

413
00:42:45,302 --> 00:42:49,646
[SPEAKER_07]: There is nobody in this building whose job it is to shepherd the green line.

414
00:42:50,648 --> 00:42:52,711
[SPEAKER_07]: through the process, through the city of Medford.

415
00:42:53,032 --> 00:43:02,990
[SPEAKER_07]: There hasn't been, for 14 years, we have basically been on the sidelines observing what the state does, not really participating in the process.

416
00:43:04,345 --> 00:43:06,588
[SPEAKER_07]: If we had that, we would have more notice.

417
00:43:07,268 --> 00:43:09,251
[SPEAKER_07]: The state can do some things.

418
00:43:09,431 --> 00:43:10,332
[SPEAKER_07]: The city can do some things.

419
00:43:10,352 --> 00:43:17,640
[SPEAKER_07]: But the city of Medford really needs to participate in the process, not observe it from the sidelines, which they've been doing now for over a decade.

420
00:43:18,381 --> 00:43:20,784
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's where a lot of this misinformation comes from.

421
00:43:21,825 --> 00:43:31,468
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're at the frustration level, which I agree with, even though I obviously support the green line and have all the way to 16, because I think it does benefit more people in Medford.

422
00:43:31,568 --> 00:43:35,109
[SPEAKER_07]: It does benefit West Medford, which is still a mile away from College Avenue.

423
00:43:35,149 --> 00:43:37,909
[SPEAKER_07]: It benefits a lot of people who cannot walk that far.

424
00:43:39,890 --> 00:43:44,694
[SPEAKER_07]: The green line going to College Ave, basically, it just touches the hillside, and it's mostly South Medford.

425
00:43:44,754 --> 00:43:49,738
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's dramatically a larger part of Medford that would benefit from Route 16.

426
00:43:50,238 --> 00:43:54,161
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is the beginning of putting this project back into the larger project.

427
00:43:54,221 --> 00:43:55,082
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a long way to go.

428
00:43:55,102 --> 00:43:57,023
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not like we have a design yet.

429
00:43:57,064 --> 00:43:58,505
[SPEAKER_07]: They're just studying it.

430
00:43:58,625 --> 00:43:59,425
[SPEAKER_07]: So I do urge.

431
00:44:00,386 --> 00:44:09,958
[SPEAKER_07]: all the people from North Street and every other street around there to get on the mailing list and I concur that the City of Medford needs to do more.

432
00:44:10,438 --> 00:44:13,922
[SPEAKER_07]: You really need to hire two or three more planners full time.

433
00:44:14,743 --> 00:44:15,444
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like you have

434
00:44:16,905 --> 00:44:18,406
[SPEAKER_07]: Somerville has seven full-time planners.

435
00:44:18,466 --> 00:44:19,047
[SPEAKER_07]: We have one.

436
00:44:19,827 --> 00:44:22,388
[SPEAKER_07]: We've added thousands of apartments in Medford.

437
00:44:22,969 --> 00:44:29,232
[SPEAKER_07]: The Green Line, all these planning things that didn't exist 20 years ago, but we have the exact same size OCD we had 20 years ago.

438
00:44:30,052 --> 00:44:34,215
[SPEAKER_07]: That is a fundamental structural imbalance in this city.

439
00:44:34,955 --> 00:44:37,837
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like having a third number of the police or fire that we have that we need.

440
00:44:38,997 --> 00:44:40,479
[SPEAKER_07]: Nobody would accept that, or teachers.

441
00:44:40,639 --> 00:44:43,262
[SPEAKER_07]: Why would we accept the same thing for planning?

442
00:44:43,562 --> 00:44:45,003
[SPEAKER_07]: And look at the pattern that's happening.

443
00:44:45,544 --> 00:44:48,387
[SPEAKER_07]: The Medford Square master plan sits for 10 years, not executed.

444
00:44:48,667 --> 00:44:50,629
[SPEAKER_07]: You have zoning problems, not executed.

445
00:44:50,889 --> 00:44:51,950
[SPEAKER_07]: You have green line problems.

446
00:44:52,050 --> 00:44:54,072
[SPEAKER_07]: The thread that ties them together

447
00:44:54,993 --> 00:44:57,095
[SPEAKER_07]: is planning and the lack thereof.

448
00:44:57,735 --> 00:45:09,543
[SPEAKER_07]: And until you get more bodies in here, not volunteers, legitimate planners full-time to accent what we already have upstairs with Lauren D'Alenzo and Clodagh and the other people who are good people, they need more help.

449
00:45:09,763 --> 00:45:14,807
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know you guys have been working on that, but it's not fast enough and the city is getting overrun by proposals.

450
00:45:15,748 --> 00:45:17,149
[SPEAKER_07]: So we need more bodies.

451
00:45:17,169 --> 00:45:17,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

452
00:45:17,809 --> 00:45:18,129
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

453
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:19,410
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Dello Russo.

454
00:45:19,991 --> 00:45:20,271
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

455
00:45:22,393 --> 00:45:25,977
[SPEAKER_25]: On the motion by Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

456
00:45:27,699 --> 00:45:30,042
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, I'm sorry.

457
00:45:32,663 --> 00:45:34,004
[SPEAKER_17]: Good evening, name and address of the record, please.

458
00:45:34,044 --> 00:45:36,225
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Ken Crouse, 50 Mystic Street.

459
00:45:36,885 --> 00:45:38,326
[SPEAKER_17]: I agree with Mary Ann.

460
00:45:38,586 --> 00:45:47,111
[SPEAKER_17]: We can't do enough as a city, as the MBTA, as a community, to engage people and provide more notification for these meetings.

461
00:45:47,131 --> 00:45:48,071
[SPEAKER_17]: They're very important.

462
00:45:48,251 --> 00:45:51,133
[SPEAKER_17]: And the more people that participate, the better.

463
00:45:51,153 --> 00:45:56,896
[SPEAKER_17]: A couple of things I just wanted to clarify, as someone who has been closely involved with the project since 2004, and one,

464
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:08,622
[SPEAKER_17]: The Walklane Court situation would, anything that would happen to Walklane Court would be decided by the Medford Housing Authority and they control that property.

465
00:46:08,802 --> 00:46:19,825
[SPEAKER_17]: And frankly, one of the largest beneficiaries of the Green Line extension will be the people who live at Walklane Court because, especially people with limited mobility.

466
00:46:20,585 --> 00:46:26,987
[SPEAKER_17]: The buses that we say we have are very difficult to get on board if you happen to be disabled.

467
00:46:27,567 --> 00:46:30,350
[SPEAKER_17]: Our commuter rail system is completely inaccessible.

468
00:46:30,490 --> 00:46:32,292
[SPEAKER_17]: If you're disabled, you can't use it at all.

469
00:46:33,453 --> 00:46:35,175
[SPEAKER_17]: The buses run very infrequently.

470
00:46:35,715 --> 00:46:37,257
[SPEAKER_17]: The trains run very infrequently.

471
00:46:37,297 --> 00:46:42,162
[SPEAKER_17]: The Green Line cars will be level boarding that will run every seven minutes or so.

472
00:46:43,103 --> 00:46:49,868
[SPEAKER_17]: will provide an unbelievably improved service to the people at Waukling Court.

473
00:46:50,489 --> 00:47:00,737
[SPEAKER_17]: And if anything, this project will leverage our opportunity to get funding to improve Waukling Court and expand it and bring it up to today's standards.

474
00:47:01,058 --> 00:47:06,902
[SPEAKER_17]: The other thing that I want to clarify in terms of historical thing that keeps being mentioned, it was mentioned last night and also today.

475
00:47:07,723 --> 00:47:15,812
[SPEAKER_17]: that there was some sort of attempt to circumvent the environmental review process on the national level.

476
00:47:16,612 --> 00:47:22,198
[SPEAKER_17]: This project was part of the draft environmental impact report, the Route 16 station in 2009.

477
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:32,485
[SPEAKER_17]: When that was completed, the MBTA, MassDOT said, we're not going to be able to include this station in the first phase of the project.

478
00:47:32,925 --> 00:47:42,350
[SPEAKER_17]: So that environmental review will proceed up to College Avenue through NEPA, the National Environmental Policy Act.

479
00:47:42,871 --> 00:47:46,113
[SPEAKER_17]: The final environmental assessment was done.

480
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:49,935
[SPEAKER_17]: But at that point, it was stated explicitly

481
00:47:50,515 --> 00:48:16,566
[SPEAKER_17]: by the Secretary of Environmental Affairs on January 15th, 2010, and I'll quote Secretary Bowles, as it is not anticipated that construction of the Medford Hillside to Mystic Valley Parkway Route 16 segment will commence within the applicable MEPA or NEPA timeframes, reassessment of alternative two will be required in the form of a notice of project change.

482
00:48:17,346 --> 00:48:23,970
[SPEAKER_17]: That's exactly what the MBTA is doing, as they were directed seven years ago by the Secretary.

483
00:48:24,611 --> 00:48:29,974
[SPEAKER_17]: This is the initial step in the environmental review, which will probably take about a year.

484
00:48:30,575 --> 00:48:34,257
[SPEAKER_17]: So again, I encourage everybody to get involved.

485
00:48:35,158 --> 00:48:41,102
[SPEAKER_17]: There was a great give and take last night of people from all angles on the project.

486
00:48:41,142 --> 00:48:45,645
[SPEAKER_17]: It was a great start to this process, and I hope people will continue to be engaged

487
00:48:46,405 --> 00:48:54,734
[SPEAKER_17]: Throughout, but I just wanted to clarify that in terms of how the process is being undertaken It's a poor it's it's totally by the book.

488
00:48:55,435 --> 00:48:55,795
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

489
00:48:55,815 --> 00:48:56,035
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

490
00:48:56,075 --> 00:48:56,396
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Gross

491
00:48:58,553 --> 00:49:01,894
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to conclude.

492
00:49:01,974 --> 00:49:09,337
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree with, thank you for the comments of Ken and Doug Carr, and I agree with Mr. Carr with regards to the lack of planners.

493
00:49:09,517 --> 00:49:14,579
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we've all spoke at budget time to request additional personnel in that department.

494
00:49:14,599 --> 00:49:18,921
[SPEAKER_09]: We were lucky to get a traffic engineer, but nobody in the planning department.

495
00:49:20,161 --> 00:49:26,744
[SPEAKER_09]: The bottom line is, with regards to just the notification, that is something that you don't even need another planner for.

496
00:49:26,824 --> 00:49:35,148
[SPEAKER_09]: Notification and sending out a reverse 911 call should be a given when it comes to such an impactful neighborhood concern.

497
00:49:35,569 --> 00:49:47,134
[SPEAKER_09]: And for a city councilor to have to beg for a reverse 911 call to go out to a very large section of the city that's going to be impacted by the Green Line to let them know of a very important meeting,

498
00:49:48,695 --> 00:50:01,984
[SPEAKER_09]: is a problem and it's an extremely large problem that's been going on for some time that needs to be fixed and hopefully that will be now that election time's over and we can stop being, not only saying we're transparent, but actually being transparent.

499
00:50:03,105 --> 00:50:03,886
[SPEAKER_20]: Vice President Box.

500
00:50:05,447 --> 00:50:06,387
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you Mr. President.

501
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:12,703
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, this is, as we heard from residents tonight, that this is a common theme.

502
00:50:14,024 --> 00:50:23,270
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, not too long ago, we heard about the Grove Street water project that's going on, and the lack of notification for abutters on Grove Street.

503
00:50:23,931 --> 00:50:35,899
[SPEAKER_20]: Tonight, we discussed, and we're going to discuss it further, the Winthrop Street Eversource project, which, again, I'm sure will be concerned with the lack of notification, and the gas line on Harvard.

504
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:42,041
[SPEAKER_20]: uh, that we discussed just recently when about has had to come up and say they never received any notification.

505
00:50:42,741 --> 00:50:51,265
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, you know, I think we're going down a real slippery slope when we keep on relying on reverse 911 to be the notification system for the city.

506
00:50:52,272 --> 00:50:58,294
[SPEAKER_20]: The 9-1-1 was never intended to be the civic engagement of the community.

507
00:50:58,814 --> 00:51:02,635
[SPEAKER_20]: It was always intended to be there for emergency purposes.

508
00:51:03,176 --> 00:51:05,536
[SPEAKER_20]: You get a reverse 9-1-1 call, think about it, 9-1-1.

509
00:51:07,513 --> 00:51:11,034
[SPEAKER_20]: It shouldn't be telling you about a soccer game going on down the street.

510
00:51:11,654 --> 00:51:14,135
[SPEAKER_20]: That's not what the intent of 9-1-1 is.

511
00:51:14,855 --> 00:51:29,178
[SPEAKER_20]: And if you look at surrounding communities, and the City of Somerville has a great program, it's called Resistat Program, and they have a system of sending out weekly email notifications to residents that sign up.

512
00:51:30,118 --> 00:51:38,720
[SPEAKER_20]: And those notifications talk directly about projects that are going on in the city, timelines, events that are happening, additional information.

513
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:43,581
[SPEAKER_20]: This is where people get their information from, not reverse 911 calls.

514
00:51:44,182 --> 00:51:45,582
[SPEAKER_20]: That's not the way it should happen.

515
00:51:46,102 --> 00:51:57,865
[SPEAKER_20]: So again, Mr. President, because of the lack of notification in this community, if I hear one more time that, oh, we follow state law, within 300 feet, we notify Director Butters.

516
00:51:58,685 --> 00:52:00,126
[SPEAKER_20]: Is that a way to operate a city?

517
00:52:00,906 --> 00:52:09,930
[SPEAKER_20]: Is that a way to talk about a project like the Green Line and say we're only going to notify these 40 people that live within 300 feet of this particular area?

518
00:52:10,430 --> 00:52:15,172
[SPEAKER_20]: Or the water project that's happening on Grove Street that impacts the whole neighborhood?

519
00:52:15,672 --> 00:52:18,393
[SPEAKER_20]: How do you just notify people within 300 feet?

520
00:52:18,693 --> 00:52:22,715
[SPEAKER_20]: That may be the state requirement, but it doesn't need to be our requirement.

521
00:52:23,695 --> 00:52:47,621
[SPEAKER_20]: our requirement should be full notification of the city and I think the city of Somerville addresses it appropriately with this Resistat program that notifies residents, you sign up for a newsletter, they hold regular community meetings to discuss and gather input from residents and we do a lot of that in this community too but the community outreach in Somerville to me is a perfect way

522
00:52:48,181 --> 00:53:03,386
[SPEAKER_20]: of reaching out to residents, and not everyone's on email, and I can appreciate that, that everyone doesn't have email, but it's an attempt to reach a broader spectrum than just, oh, state law requires us to notify Director Butters within 300 feet.

523
00:53:03,886 --> 00:53:09,608
[SPEAKER_20]: That's not adequate in a city this size, and we hear week after week after week the concerns of residents.

524
00:53:10,028 --> 00:53:15,170
[SPEAKER_20]: So I would ask, Mr. President, that this city administration look into another

525
00:53:15,670 --> 00:53:25,138
[SPEAKER_20]: way of communicating and engaging people in the public process in this community other than reverse 9-1-1.

526
00:53:25,519 --> 00:53:28,381
[SPEAKER_20]: That's a great asset and it should be used for emergencies.

527
00:53:29,082 --> 00:53:34,366
[SPEAKER_20]: But look into another program that could alert residents on things that are happening.

528
00:53:34,406 --> 00:53:36,708
[SPEAKER_20]: If you're not interested, you don't sign up for the

529
00:53:39,530 --> 00:53:43,851
[SPEAKER_20]: the weekly emails that go out, the newsletters.

530
00:53:44,972 --> 00:53:53,374
[SPEAKER_20]: But if you are interested, Mr. President, it's a great way of letting abutters and residents of this community know what's going on, timelines.

531
00:53:53,714 --> 00:53:58,695
[SPEAKER_20]: How many times do you hear from people saying, jeez, you know, we heard that this project's starting, when does it end?

532
00:53:59,155 --> 00:54:01,255
[SPEAKER_20]: Is it going to go through the holiday period?

533
00:54:01,315 --> 00:54:02,016
[SPEAKER_20]: When's it going to end?

534
00:54:02,396 --> 00:54:03,196
[SPEAKER_20]: Where are we going to park?

535
00:54:03,216 --> 00:54:04,596
[SPEAKER_20]: Where are they going to stage the equipment?

536
00:54:04,956 --> 00:54:21,760
[SPEAKER_20]: This should all be in a newsletter and things that people can read readily available and not through just a random 911 call or a random meeting that people may or may not be able to attend on a five o'clock on a Tuesday night here at City Hall or wherever the meeting might be, Mr. President.

537
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:23,920
[SPEAKER_20]: So I would respectfully ask my colleagues

538
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:39,387
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. President, to send a recommendation to the city administration to mimic a program similar to what they do in Somerville called the Resistat program, which provides ample notification to residents via news email letters.

539
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:40,868
[SPEAKER_25]: You want to add it onto this, correct?

540
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:42,709
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, yes, Mr. President.

541
00:54:42,729 --> 00:54:47,991
[SPEAKER_20]: I know that was one of Council Lungo's recommendations regarding notification.

542
00:54:48,411 --> 00:54:55,654
[SPEAKER_20]: So I would ask that we amend it, Mr. President, to address the very serious issues that we hear week after week.

543
00:54:55,694 --> 00:54:58,515
[SPEAKER_20]: If this was an isolated incident, I wouldn't bother.

544
00:54:58,815 --> 00:55:00,496
[SPEAKER_20]: But week after week, I think we do.

545
00:55:00,856 --> 00:55:04,177
[SPEAKER_20]: And you heard from many of the residents that got up.

546
00:55:04,818 --> 00:55:09,420
[SPEAKER_20]: One of the biggest, I think, drawbacks in this community is the lack of notification.

547
00:55:10,736 --> 00:55:27,461
[SPEAKER_20]: Even with the zoning board meetings, you know, we hear about this that show up and say, I'm not opposed to this five-story building, but I am opposed to the fact that I had to find a crumpled up piece of paper in the middle of the street that alerted, you're supposed to alert me to a meeting that was taking place that impacts my neighborhood.

548
00:55:27,941 --> 00:55:33,763
[SPEAKER_20]: So I think those are the issues, Mr. President, and I would ask that that be done in a roll call vote as a form.

549
00:55:33,803 --> 00:55:34,823
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. President.

550
00:55:35,244 --> 00:55:39,245
[SPEAKER_25]: On the motion by Councilor Leong Cunningham, as amended by Councilor Marks,

551
00:55:40,947 --> 00:55:43,748
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr., are you requesting a roll call vote, Councilor Marks?

552
00:55:45,189 --> 00:55:45,769
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Knight.

553
00:55:46,429 --> 00:55:51,932
[SPEAKER_24]: I further amend the paper and just ask that copies of the request to the MBTA go to a state delegation as well.

554
00:55:52,712 --> 00:55:56,874
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Clerk, if you can amend the paper that the papers go to the state delegation as well.

555
00:55:56,894 --> 00:55:59,235
[SPEAKER_25]: Mr. President.

556
00:55:59,255 --> 00:56:00,175
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Dello Russo.

557
00:56:01,136 --> 00:56:06,338
[SPEAKER_17]: Some members of the attending audience wish to address this matter further.

558
00:56:07,295 --> 00:56:08,415
[SPEAKER_25]: Mr. Duchoux, do you want to speak again?

559
00:56:08,775 --> 00:56:10,556
[SPEAKER_25]: Before the roll call is taken.

560
00:56:10,716 --> 00:56:14,837
[SPEAKER_15]: Just one point of clarification for Mr. Krause about Walkling Court.

561
00:56:15,517 --> 00:56:22,618
[SPEAKER_15]: The problem with Walkling Court is that the commuter rail train is going to be moved closer to the buildings.

562
00:56:23,218 --> 00:56:33,781
[SPEAKER_15]: And right now, between the edge of the building and the fence where the track is, there's only the width of a fire lane.

563
00:56:34,976 --> 00:56:41,118
[SPEAKER_15]: So if that fence has to come in onto the fire lane, that can't be.

564
00:56:41,178 --> 00:56:42,558
[SPEAKER_15]: There has to be a fire lane there.

565
00:56:42,978 --> 00:56:45,739
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's what puts Walkman Court in jeopardy.

566
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:47,780
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just wanted to clarify that.

567
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:48,080
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

568
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:49,160
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Mrs. Dutcher.

569
00:56:51,721 --> 00:56:52,101
[SPEAKER_25]: Good evening.

570
00:56:52,121 --> 00:56:53,182
[SPEAKER_25]: Name and address of the record, please.

571
00:56:54,182 --> 00:56:56,903
[SPEAKER_23]: Andrew Castagnetti, Cushing Street, Method, Massachusetts.

572
00:56:56,923 --> 00:56:57,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome back.

573
00:56:58,713 --> 00:56:59,414
[SPEAKER_23]: Welcome to you.

574
00:56:59,934 --> 00:57:01,695
[SPEAKER_23]: Nice to see all the city councilors.

575
00:57:01,775 --> 00:57:02,776
[SPEAKER_23]: Congratulations.

576
00:57:03,657 --> 00:57:05,378
[SPEAKER_23]: You're all back in your respective seats.

577
00:57:05,899 --> 00:57:06,219
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

578
00:57:06,319 --> 00:57:07,220
[SPEAKER_23]: The gang of seven.

579
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:13,464
[SPEAKER_23]: And I'd like to also congratulate the first mayor in the Oval Office.

580
00:57:14,125 --> 00:57:27,375
[SPEAKER_23]: And more importantly, I'd like to thank all the challengers that ran with their ideas and foresight to hopefully help city government improve society.

581
00:57:28,476 --> 00:57:30,877
[SPEAKER_23]: If I may, I'd like to commend them big time.

582
00:57:32,617 --> 00:57:44,519
[SPEAKER_23]: Back to the subject of the Green Line, Mariana Ducci brought up some good points, especially the advertisement.

583
00:57:45,199 --> 00:57:57,082
[SPEAKER_23]: I would think, I'm old school, it should be in the method non-script, I mean the transcript, at least one week prior.

584
00:57:59,047 --> 00:58:00,227
[SPEAKER_23]: not two days prior.

585
00:58:02,908 --> 00:58:18,252
[SPEAKER_23]: Also, I believe Mary Ann made some noise about this green line extending from College Ave, Tufts University, westward to uh,

586
00:58:20,263 --> 00:58:22,065
[SPEAKER_23]: Route 16 and Boston Avenue.

587
00:58:22,865 --> 00:58:45,665
[SPEAKER_23]: That seems kind of redundant to me, the way I think, because that's at the doorstep of West Medford Square, and they already have a commuter line that goes to Boston, and it also goes right through Winchester, and that's above ground, mind you, with the freight trains also, at all hours.

588
00:58:47,604 --> 00:58:53,889
[SPEAKER_23]: On the other side, the east side of our city, Malton Center, has the Orange Line.

589
00:58:53,909 --> 00:59:08,520
[SPEAKER_23]: I would think common sense would dictate many years ago, from college out, they should put an underground tunnel.

590
00:59:10,287 --> 00:59:36,798
[SPEAKER_23]: without doing any eminent domain to speak of, and have it emerge in the Medford Square subway station right behind you, Councilor, President, and take that one building by eminent domain, the red brick building, you could put down a piece of grass, you could call it the Medford Commons, and you would have the eternal stimulus, economically speaking, for all times.

591
00:59:40,325 --> 00:59:43,406
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay, cost extra, cost more underground.

592
00:59:43,866 --> 00:59:46,567
[SPEAKER_23]: I've talked to the union reps that dig these tunnels.

593
00:59:48,408 --> 00:59:58,812
[SPEAKER_23]: Maybe if Tufts really wants their station, maybe with $7 billion in the bank, they could put up some cash in a form of a bond.

594
00:59:59,772 --> 01:00:08,816
[SPEAKER_23]: They get their Green Line station, and when it's completed, maybe they would volunteer their funds to dig the tunnel underground.

595
01:00:09,957 --> 01:00:12,659
[SPEAKER_23]: Again, we are five miles north of Boston.

596
01:00:13,539 --> 01:00:14,940
[SPEAKER_23]: Route 93 is right here.

597
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:20,263
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't understand, in my opinion, the lack of common sense.

598
01:00:21,184 --> 01:00:24,646
[SPEAKER_23]: And we should turn our back towards the river and not away from the river.

599
01:00:25,166 --> 01:00:29,649
[SPEAKER_23]: This could be the most happening place all of the North Shore, in my opinion.

600
01:00:30,110 --> 01:00:30,890
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you for listening.

601
01:00:30,910 --> 01:00:31,430
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Mr. Castagnetti.

602
01:00:32,691 --> 01:00:33,652
[SPEAKER_25]: On the motion, if I could.

603
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:36,160
[SPEAKER_25]: Good evening.

604
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:37,181
[SPEAKER_25]: Name and address of the record please.

605
01:00:37,562 --> 01:00:40,484
[SPEAKER_44]: My name is Rita Donnelly and I live at 35 Charnwood Road.

606
01:00:40,945 --> 01:00:43,527
[SPEAKER_44]: I'm a direct abutter to the tracks.

607
01:00:43,687 --> 01:00:47,971
[SPEAKER_44]: I did get an email because in 2009 I did get on the email list.

608
01:00:48,832 --> 01:00:54,197
[SPEAKER_44]: I appreciate what Councilor Knight said about contacting our state reps.

609
01:00:55,318 --> 01:01:00,182
[SPEAKER_44]: Our state reps are Senator Jalen and Representative Barber.

610
01:01:01,108 --> 01:01:02,468
[SPEAKER_44]: They are for this project.

611
01:01:03,209 --> 01:01:05,249
[SPEAKER_44]: They do not care about the Director Butters.

612
01:01:05,689 --> 01:01:08,910
[SPEAKER_44]: We are a small constituency to them.

613
01:01:09,590 --> 01:01:11,271
[SPEAKER_44]: They are going to do whatever Somerville wants.

614
01:01:12,051 --> 01:01:25,655
[SPEAKER_44]: I have also spoken to the Mayor and asked her to look at our neighborhood and the changes that will take place in our neighborhood and how you will drive people who have lived in this city for years out.

615
01:01:28,222 --> 01:01:29,363
[SPEAKER_44]: I am directly affected.

616
01:01:29,383 --> 01:01:32,324
[SPEAKER_44]: The commuter rail will come towards me.

617
01:01:32,344 --> 01:01:40,648
[SPEAKER_44]: I haven't decided what I'm going to do, but the diesel particulates, MEPA has said that they are a carcinogen.

618
01:01:40,988 --> 01:01:44,730
[SPEAKER_44]: They cause asthma, COPD, lung cancer.

619
01:01:45,950 --> 01:01:47,171
[SPEAKER_44]: I've lived there for 20 years.

620
01:01:47,251 --> 01:01:49,733
[SPEAKER_44]: When I bought my house, I didn't know about diesel particulates.

621
01:01:50,314 --> 01:01:59,160
[SPEAKER_44]: I do not understand how you can move a known carcinogen closer to the public for a mile of track.

622
01:02:00,601 --> 01:02:03,023
[SPEAKER_44]: College Ave, the railway is wide enough.

623
01:02:03,644 --> 01:02:06,406
[SPEAKER_44]: It narrows as you go from College Ave to Route 16.

624
01:02:06,746 --> 01:02:10,269
[SPEAKER_44]: They don't want you to call it Route 16 because Route 16 is so busy.

625
01:02:10,589 --> 01:02:12,411
[SPEAKER_44]: It is now the Mystic Valley Parkway.

626
01:02:13,462 --> 01:02:16,787
[SPEAKER_44]: because who refers to it as the Mystic Valley Parkway?

627
01:02:17,628 --> 01:02:19,511
[SPEAKER_44]: It sounds like a beautiful drive, doesn't it?

628
01:02:20,853 --> 01:02:21,895
[SPEAKER_44]: So I would hope.

629
01:02:23,087 --> 01:02:30,852
[SPEAKER_44]: that this council will keep the neighborhood and the residents that are directly impacted by this project.

630
01:02:31,433 --> 01:02:39,098
[SPEAKER_44]: If it has to go to the Mystic Valley Parkway, it has to go, but it has to go safely and without impact to the residents.

631
01:02:39,698 --> 01:02:45,422
[SPEAKER_44]: I have several new neighbors that have moved into the neighborhood with small children.

632
01:02:47,023 --> 01:02:48,084
[SPEAKER_44]: They bought the tracks.

633
01:02:48,804 --> 01:02:54,008
[SPEAKER_44]: They didn't know about the diesel particulates and they were not notified to come to the meeting.

634
01:02:55,248 --> 01:03:04,995
[SPEAKER_44]: So it's a sad situation when people have lived in this city and supported this city and been a part of this community and their voices are not heard.

635
01:03:05,015 --> 01:03:09,278
[SPEAKER_44]: There's a select few that are for the Green Line extension.

636
01:03:10,908 --> 01:03:11,789
[SPEAKER_44]: And they are a group.

637
01:03:12,450 --> 01:03:13,731
[SPEAKER_44]: And they talk amongst themselves.

638
01:03:13,771 --> 01:03:26,143
[SPEAKER_44]: And they seem to have unlimited time to talk about it and to push the representatives and the mayor forward on this project without any consideration to the people that actually live there.

639
01:03:27,044 --> 01:03:27,825
[SPEAKER_44]: And it's not right.

640
01:03:28,045 --> 01:03:28,986
[SPEAKER_44]: I don't have a voice.

641
01:03:30,192 --> 01:03:34,256
[SPEAKER_44]: I did try several years ago to talk to Senator Jalen about this.

642
01:03:34,837 --> 01:03:38,620
[SPEAKER_44]: She looked over my head to see who she could find to talk to.

643
01:03:39,561 --> 01:03:40,502
[SPEAKER_44]: That is wrong.

644
01:03:41,463 --> 01:03:45,427
[SPEAKER_44]: When I spoke to Carl Scortino, he was on the opposite side of me.

645
01:03:46,047 --> 01:03:51,452
[SPEAKER_44]: He had an intelligent conversation with me, he explained things to me, I felt better about

646
01:03:52,413 --> 01:03:54,875
[SPEAKER_44]: The Green Line extension, at least my voice was heard.

647
01:03:54,895 --> 01:03:57,557
[SPEAKER_44]: I do not feel like my voice is being heard today.

648
01:03:58,178 --> 01:03:59,899
[SPEAKER_44]: And it's unfair and unfortunate.

649
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:01,140
[SPEAKER_44]: And I love Medford.

650
01:04:01,721 --> 01:04:02,882
[SPEAKER_44]: I've lived here a long time.

651
01:04:04,063 --> 01:04:09,007
[SPEAKER_44]: And it's just not right, the way that things are done behind people's backs.

652
01:04:10,007 --> 01:04:14,291
[SPEAKER_44]: And the people that are directly affected are not notified.

653
01:04:15,532 --> 01:04:15,892
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you.

654
01:04:16,272 --> 01:04:16,533
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

655
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:22,840
[SPEAKER_42]: Anita Nagum, 9 Norton Avenue.

656
01:04:23,501 --> 01:04:24,882
[SPEAKER_42]: I would just like to follow up quickly.

657
01:04:25,422 --> 01:04:28,204
[SPEAKER_42]: First, I addressed this specific issue last night at the meeting.

658
01:04:28,464 --> 01:04:33,768
[SPEAKER_42]: The state currently has no plans to do a review under NEPA policy.

659
01:04:34,368 --> 01:04:42,915
[SPEAKER_42]: If at some point in the future they decide to seek federal funding, they would do one, but right now it will only be done under NEPA Massachusetts policy.

660
01:04:43,727 --> 01:04:47,708
[SPEAKER_42]: Second, I just want to say I am very much in favor of public transportation.

661
01:04:47,908 --> 01:04:55,109
[SPEAKER_42]: I bought my house in Medford Hillside 28 years ago because it was very well served by public transportation.

662
01:04:57,210 --> 01:05:04,431
[SPEAKER_42]: We didn't have a car for 10 years, and we used the MBTA almost exclusively, except for times when we have large loads to carry.

663
01:05:04,451 --> 01:05:11,073
[SPEAKER_42]: I also worked with the MBTA, and at my suggestion, because I used to live in Winter Hill and go to Cambridge,

664
01:05:12,202 --> 01:05:19,307
[SPEAKER_42]: The only way at that time to get to Cambridge from Winter Hill was to go to Sullivan Square, into the city, and come back out.

665
01:05:20,968 --> 01:05:29,113
[SPEAKER_42]: It's not a great solution, but what they came up with was running the 89 bus that runs from Sullivan Square to Clarendon Hill.

666
01:05:29,834 --> 01:05:32,236
[SPEAKER_42]: Every other bus now goes to Davis Square.

667
01:05:33,577 --> 01:05:37,539
[SPEAKER_42]: So I just want to say I'm very much in favor of public transportation.

668
01:05:39,773 --> 01:05:42,515
[SPEAKER_42]: This project is not cost effective.

669
01:05:42,535 --> 01:05:47,399
[SPEAKER_42]: It is not going to improve transportation for the residents of Medford Hillside.

670
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:49,701
[SPEAKER_42]: My husband teaches at Boston University.

671
01:05:50,042 --> 01:05:50,983
[SPEAKER_42]: He takes the Green Line.

672
01:05:51,723 --> 01:05:54,666
[SPEAKER_42]: I have timed how long it takes to go from Lechmere to Park Street.

673
01:05:55,266 --> 01:05:56,908
[SPEAKER_42]: It was 14 minutes off peak.

674
01:05:57,268 --> 01:06:00,511
[SPEAKER_42]: And you might be able to reduce that a minute or two.

675
01:06:02,563 --> 01:06:12,366
[SPEAKER_42]: Even if this comes all the way out to Medford Hillside and it's two minutes from our house, it would still be faster for him to go to Davis Square, get on the red line, and get on the green line at Park Street.

676
01:06:13,287 --> 01:06:15,547
[SPEAKER_42]: This is not for the benefit of Medford residents.

677
01:06:15,868 --> 01:06:17,568
[SPEAKER_42]: This is to open the door to development.

678
01:06:18,148 --> 01:06:20,509
[SPEAKER_42]: And again, the City Council brought this up.

679
01:06:21,369 --> 01:06:22,510
[SPEAKER_42]: Councilor Marks brought this up.

680
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:47,091
[SPEAKER_42]: People outside, the last time I followed comments from, I very closely when the draft and final environmental reviews came up, about 60% of the comments, if I recall, came from people in Acton and Concord who wanted this because they want to come, park here, drive here, and take the T into Boston.

681
01:06:47,992 --> 01:06:53,715
[SPEAKER_42]: Most of the Medford residents, a majority, who commented and were actually,

682
01:06:54,775 --> 01:07:00,941
[SPEAKER_42]: who lived very close to the station, not even West Medford, but in the Medford Hillside area, were not in favor of this.

683
01:07:02,956 --> 01:07:11,182
[SPEAKER_42]: The last thing I want to say is, at one of the meetings in the previous series of meetings, I was speaking with Catherine Fichter, who I believe was with MassDOT.

684
01:07:11,202 --> 01:07:17,167
[SPEAKER_42]: She might have been with the Mass Planning Council, Massachusetts Area Planning Council.

685
01:07:17,727 --> 01:07:24,973
[SPEAKER_42]: But she actually said to me, well, we envision Medford Hillside becoming the next Davis Square.

686
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:28,641
[SPEAKER_42]: That statement really took me aback.

687
01:07:29,281 --> 01:07:34,424
[SPEAKER_42]: And I would urge the city council to start getting involved and advocate for the residents.

688
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:37,166
[SPEAKER_42]: I don't live in Davis Square because I don't want to.

689
01:07:38,086 --> 01:07:38,886
[SPEAKER_42]: I live where I do.

690
01:07:39,947 --> 01:07:40,707
[SPEAKER_42]: It is quiet.

691
01:07:41,068 --> 01:07:43,009
[SPEAKER_42]: I grew up actually in a very small town.

692
01:07:44,890 --> 01:07:46,410
[SPEAKER_42]: Even though I am 150 yards from the tracks,

693
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:52,522
[SPEAKER_42]: You could not believe how quiet it is there.

694
01:07:52,922 --> 01:07:56,904
[SPEAKER_42]: That is one of the things that is the best about living in Medford Hillside.

695
01:07:57,324 --> 01:07:58,005
[SPEAKER_42]: It is peaceful.

696
01:07:58,085 --> 01:07:58,645
[SPEAKER_42]: It is quiet.

697
01:07:58,725 --> 01:08:05,649
[SPEAKER_42]: And even with the commuter rail, which runs occasionally, and an occasional freight train, those are occasional occurrences.

698
01:08:05,689 --> 01:08:07,150
[SPEAKER_42]: They're not disruptive to your life.

699
01:08:07,991 --> 01:08:11,713
[SPEAKER_42]: A Green Line train running every 10 or 15 minutes all day would be.

700
01:08:12,413 --> 01:08:17,837
[SPEAKER_42]: And I would really urge the city council to start advocating for the residents of Medford Hillside who do not

701
01:08:19,473 --> 01:08:23,814
[SPEAKER_42]: want the development that would come with this station.

702
01:08:23,894 --> 01:08:29,056
[SPEAKER_42]: It is clear from the meetings that this is not just going to be a simple station.

703
01:08:30,037 --> 01:08:31,957
[SPEAKER_42]: There's going to be a lot that goes with it.

704
01:08:32,977 --> 01:08:34,558
[SPEAKER_42]: It's going to be a magnet for development.

705
01:08:35,058 --> 01:08:42,541
[SPEAKER_42]: And I would really, really urge you to pay attention and listen to the concerns of the residents of the area.

706
01:08:42,561 --> 01:08:43,361
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

707
01:08:45,423 --> 01:08:47,523
[SPEAKER_25]: On the motion by Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

01:10:44,807 --> 01:10:58,041
[SPEAKER_18]: We are planning to install a 115 kV transmission line from Woobin Station to Mystic Station in Everett.

743
01:10:59,122 --> 01:11:02,325
[SPEAKER_18]: This would be about, I believe, 7.7 miles.

744
01:11:06,408 --> 01:11:11,173
[SPEAKER_18]: would be about two miles within the city of Medford.

745
01:11:12,634 --> 01:11:12,935
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

746
01:11:13,435 --> 01:11:19,501
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Scarpelli, who is the Chairman of the Licensing Division, do you have a motion on this?

747
01:11:19,922 --> 01:11:21,944
[SPEAKER_10]: We do, I believe the motion is to table.

748
01:11:22,084 --> 01:11:30,052
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that we had a meeting prior to this, it was very informative, but I think that we ran out of time and a lot of the

749
01:11:30,872 --> 01:11:41,640
[SPEAKER_10]: Constituents' concerns need to be addressed before we vote on this, so I believe that we're recommendation to table this until meeting on December 5th, I believe.

750
01:11:42,599 --> 01:11:44,540
[SPEAKER_10]: December 5th, Tuesday.

751
01:11:44,841 --> 01:11:48,403
[SPEAKER_25]: Tuesday, December 5th will be the next hearing, and hopefully we can get it all squared away by then.

752
01:11:48,743 --> 01:11:50,545
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, that'd be 545?

753
01:11:51,405 --> 01:11:51,645
[SPEAKER_18]: 545 again.

754
01:11:51,846 --> 01:11:52,046

[SPEAKER_43]: which is good to see.

793
01:13:57,135 --> 01:13:58,678

01:13:58,718 --> 01:14:09,334
[SPEAKER_03]: It was good to see you and George is a great guy as was Ricardo from Medford eyeglass shop and they're very invested in that community and so I thank you for your graciousness.

01:14:09,434 --> 01:14:09,894
[SPEAKER_20]: No worries.

796
01:14:10,788 --> 01:14:11,288
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you.

797
01:14:11,368 --> 01:14:12,089
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:14:12,169 --> 01:14:14,510
[SPEAKER_20]: Good luck to you guys as well.

799
01:14:15,251 --> 01:14:16,231
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you Mr. President.

800
01:14:16,311 --> 01:14:21,695
[SPEAKER_20]: I just want to state that the chamber using the interview process.

801
01:14:22,115 --> 01:14:25,117
[SPEAKER_20]: The person is lucky they get a job or they're happy they get a job.

802
01:14:25,577 --> 01:14:33,322
[SPEAKER_20]: But the chamber is going to be very lucky that Maria accepted the job because honestly I've never met someone so energetic.

803
01:14:34,282 --> 01:14:43,307
[SPEAKER_20]: Someone that really is a leading advocate in this community for a lot of different issues, as well as business issues.

804
01:14:43,967 --> 01:14:46,929
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think it's going to be a great fit, Mr. President.

805
01:14:47,489 --> 01:14:53,172
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think Maria single-handedly is going to put the chamber back on the map again, where they rightfully should be.

806
01:14:54,893 --> 01:14:56,235
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely, that's the goal.

807
01:14:56,375 --> 01:14:58,278
[SPEAKER_20]: That was the energetic part I was just talking about.

808
01:14:58,298 --> 01:14:59,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, thank you.

809
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:04,006
[SPEAKER_20]: But really, it's a great selection and I look forward to working with you Maria and the Chamber.

810
01:15:04,206 --> 01:15:06,509
[SPEAKER_03]: I look forward to seeing all of you at one of our events.

811
01:15:06,689 --> 01:15:07,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

812
01:15:07,510 --> 01:15:09,774
[SPEAKER_25]: And I'm proud to be the one to sponsor Maria for the job.

813
01:15:11,302 --> 01:15:15,084
[SPEAKER_25]: So Maria, thank you, and thank you to Gina Donnelly for the work that she's done prior to you.

814
01:15:15,204 --> 01:15:18,965
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, welcome to the chamber, and we look forward to your good work.

815
01:15:19,825 --> 01:15:20,166
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

816
01:15:20,586 --> 01:15:30,850
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm sorry?

817
01:15:30,870 --> 01:15:34,471
[SPEAKER_25]: The motion by Councilor Marks to approve the paper.

818
01:15:34,911 --> 01:15:37,052
[SPEAKER_25]: Seconded by Councilor Falco, all those in favor?

819
01:15:37,092 --> 01:15:37,833
[SPEAKER_25]: Motion passes, 17.

820
01:15:39,305 --> 01:15:46,807
[SPEAKER_25]: 7-5-8 offered by Councilor Falco, be it resolved that the DPW install a no left turn sign between the hours of 7 a.m.

821
01:15:46,847 --> 01:15:47,347
[SPEAKER_25]: and 9 a.m.

822
01:15:47,987 --> 01:15:50,908
[SPEAKER_25]: and a no right turn sign between the hours of 7 a.m.

823
01:15:50,968 --> 01:15:51,548
[SPEAKER_25]: and 9 p.m.

824
01:15:51,948 --> 01:15:56,789
[SPEAKER_25]: at the intersection of Elm Street and Brackett Street in the interest of public safety.

825
01:15:57,629 --> 01:15:59,230
[SPEAKER_25]: Signs should be placed on Elm Street.

826
01:16:00,370 --> 01:16:01,270
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Falco.

827
01:16:01,410 --> 01:16:02,351
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you, Mr. President.

828
01:16:02,791 --> 01:16:07,052
[SPEAKER_43]: This issue is recently, actually, it's gotten better.

829
01:16:07,913 --> 01:16:16,296
[SPEAKER_43]: They put up a DPW with the assistance, well, it passed the traffic commission, and they put up a do not enter sign from 7 to 9 a.m.

830
01:16:16,376 --> 01:16:27,079
[SPEAKER_43]: in the morning, and that's helped out tremendously with regard to the traffic that flows down Brackett Street onto Andrew Street and all the surrounding streets, and it has significantly lessened the traffic on Fulton Street in the morning.

831
01:16:28,820 --> 01:16:32,325
[SPEAKER_43]: You know, it's impossible to do constant nonstop enforcement.

832
01:16:32,385 --> 01:16:39,616
[SPEAKER_43]: So there are people that do take that, depending on which way you're coming down Elm, they'll take a right or a left to go down Brackett.

833
01:16:40,016 --> 01:16:44,723
[SPEAKER_43]: So I'm just basically asking that if we could have a no right hand.

834
01:16:45,444 --> 01:16:53,887
[SPEAKER_43]: If you come and ask north of Elm, no right-hand turn sign and no left-hand turn sign if you're going south down Elm.

835
01:16:54,567 --> 01:17:03,291
[SPEAKER_43]: So just to prevent people from going down Brackett Street in the morning between 7 and 9 a.m., so just asking if the DPW could put up those signs.

836
01:17:03,351 --> 01:17:09,753
[SPEAKER_43]: And of course, if you could send this before the Traffic Commission first for their approval and their advice as well.

837
01:17:09,973 --> 01:17:11,114
[SPEAKER_25]: So move approval.

838
01:17:11,874 --> 01:17:15,096
[SPEAKER_25]: On the motion by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

839
01:17:15,176 --> 01:17:17,297
[SPEAKER_25]: All those in favor?

840
01:17:17,457 --> 01:17:19,818
[SPEAKER_25]: Motion passes, 17-760 offered by Councilor Falco.

841
01:17:20,218 --> 01:17:34,264
[SPEAKER_25]: Whereas the administration has been meeting on an ongoing basis to plan and design the new Medford Police Station, be it resolved that the administration provide an update to the Medford City Council with regard to the status of the Medford Police Station in the timeline of construction.

842
01:17:34,644 --> 01:17:35,445
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Falco.

843
01:17:36,525 --> 01:17:37,346
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you, Mr. President.

844
01:17:38,246 --> 01:17:40,107
[SPEAKER_43]: I believe you may have skipped a resolution, though.

845
01:17:41,405 --> 01:17:43,046
[SPEAKER_25]: OK, we'll do that one.

846
01:17:43,066 --> 01:17:43,426
[SPEAKER_43]: OK, perfect.

847
01:17:43,486 --> 01:17:43,867
[SPEAKER_43]: Sounds good.

848
01:17:45,207 --> 01:17:51,991
[SPEAKER_43]: Yeah, so throughout the last few months, I've received a lot of calls with regard to the police station, the progress that's been made.

849
01:17:52,031 --> 01:17:58,936
[SPEAKER_43]: And I know the administration has been working hard with the chief of police and the Medford Police Department with ongoing meetings.

850
01:17:59,676 --> 01:18:03,277
[SPEAKER_43]: with regard to the future of the police station in that project in general.

851
01:18:04,277 --> 01:18:16,199
[SPEAKER_43]: So I just think, you know, we've already appropriated some money and I know we're going to be appropriating money in the future to build a police station, that it's fair that we at this point in time ask for an update with regard to the project.

852
01:18:16,580 --> 01:18:28,242
[SPEAKER_43]: Any information that we can receive in, you know, timeline as well I think would be beneficial to all of us just because I know that I'm receiving calls, I'm sure many members have been receiving calls about this issue as well.

853
01:18:28,762 --> 01:18:39,991
[SPEAKER_43]: So if we could receive some sort of formal communication from the administration, just updating us with regard to this issue, or committee of the whole meeting, if that's the way members would like to go, I think that's fine too.

854
01:18:40,111 --> 01:18:42,033
[SPEAKER_43]: So, I move approval.

855
01:18:42,693 --> 01:18:45,916
[SPEAKER_25]: On the motion by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor McLaren.

856
01:18:46,596 --> 01:18:47,317
[SPEAKER_25]: Sorry, Councilor.

857
01:18:48,679 --> 01:18:49,159
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Knight.

858
01:18:49,639 --> 01:18:50,880
[SPEAKER_28]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

859
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:59,942
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm just hoping I can amend the paper with no objection from the Councilor to get an update also from the fire training tower search committee and where they are in the process as well.

860
01:19:00,022 --> 01:19:12,906
[SPEAKER_28]: Part of the appropriation for the design funds for the police station was also a commitment from the administration as well as the creation of an ad hoc group to go out there and be sure that we have the opportunity and ability to relocate our fire training tower with the construction of a new police station.

861
01:19:13,286 --> 01:19:17,027
[SPEAKER_28]: So I'd just like to ask for an update from our training tower committee as well, Mr. President.

862
01:19:17,407 --> 01:19:17,727
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

863
01:19:18,007 --> 01:19:18,748
[SPEAKER_09]: Council Member O'Kurin.

864
01:19:19,188 --> 01:19:20,569
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

865
01:19:20,589 --> 01:19:22,771
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to thank Councilor Falco for bringing this forward.

866
01:19:22,811 --> 01:19:29,475
[SPEAKER_09]: I too have, you know, received questions, people questioning what's the process, where we are at the process with the police station.

867
01:19:29,495 --> 01:19:31,436
[SPEAKER_09]: So I wanted to second the resolve.

868
01:19:31,476 --> 01:19:35,839
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it is time that the City Council gets a written update of where we're at.

869
01:19:36,079 --> 01:19:39,722
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that the Mayor spoke of

870
01:19:42,112 --> 01:19:54,204
[SPEAKER_09]: the process and how it takes time during the debate, but a written update so that we know exactly what's taking place, where we are now, and a timeline of where we're going to be in the next few months.

871
01:19:54,584 --> 01:20:03,093
[SPEAKER_09]: That way we can tell our constituents as well as those who work in the police department a timeline and we have an idea of what's going on that will be beneficial.

872
01:20:03,613 --> 01:20:13,341
[SPEAKER_09]: And also maybe going forward if I could just amend it that we get an update every three to six months so that we know where we're at and how we're going to proceed and how it's going to progress.

873
01:20:13,642 --> 01:20:14,843
[SPEAKER_09]: I know things take time.

874
01:20:17,169 --> 01:20:27,679
[SPEAKER_09]: Having answers, if the city council is informed and we can let the public know and the men and women that work there know that things are being done, I think it will be helpful.

875
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:32,404
[SPEAKER_09]: But us not ever getting an update, it doesn't help the process.

876
01:20:32,724 --> 01:20:38,790
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel as one councillor, if I'm not getting updated, then really what is going on and I really have no answers.

877
01:20:40,191 --> 01:20:47,357
[SPEAKER_09]: Letting the police department know, as well as the council, a monthly or bimonthly update would be very beneficial.

878
01:20:48,018 --> 01:20:48,478
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

879
01:20:48,638 --> 01:20:54,884
[SPEAKER_25]: On the motion by Councilor Falco, as amended by Councilor Knight and Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

880
01:20:55,464 --> 01:20:56,185
[SPEAKER_25]: All those in favor?

881
01:20:57,908 --> 01:20:59,569
[SPEAKER_25]: Motion passes.

882
01:20:59,589 --> 01:21:10,014
[SPEAKER_25]: 17-759, offered by Councilor Falco, be it resolved that the DPW correct the divot in the road in front of 20 Windsor Road in the interest of public safety.

883
01:21:10,114 --> 01:21:11,075
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Falco.

884
01:21:11,215 --> 01:21:11,975
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you, Mr. President.

885
01:21:12,015 --> 01:21:16,618
[SPEAKER_43]: I received a call from a number of residents down on Windsor Road regarding it's a divot.

886
01:21:16,658 --> 01:21:22,741
[SPEAKER_43]: It looks like it's actually maybe some trench work that was done before in the past and it's sunk over time.

887
01:21:22,781 --> 01:21:26,523
[SPEAKER_43]: So if we could just have the DPW go by and just try to fill that in.

888
01:21:27,083 --> 01:21:29,745
[SPEAKER_43]: to level the surface in the interest of public safety.

889
01:21:29,785 --> 01:21:30,605
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

890
01:21:30,625 --> 01:21:33,087
[SPEAKER_25]: On the motion by Councilor Falco, seconded by?

891
01:21:33,107 --> 01:21:33,247
[SPEAKER_25]: Second.

892
01:21:34,828 --> 01:21:35,609
[SPEAKER_25]: By Councilor Knight.

893
01:21:35,669 --> 01:21:37,890
[SPEAKER_25]: All those in favor?

894
01:21:38,871 --> 01:21:40,152
[SPEAKER_25]: Motion passes.

895
01:21:40,392 --> 01:21:53,561
[SPEAKER_25]: 17761, offered by Councilor Falco, be it resolved that the DPW print a stop line at the intersection of Water Street and Fulton Street and at the intersection of Water Street and Fulton Street in the interest of public safety.

896
01:21:53,641 --> 01:21:54,522
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Falco.

897
01:21:55,022 --> 01:21:55,923
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you, Mr. President.

898
01:21:56,083 --> 01:22:04,710
[SPEAKER_43]: I received a number of calls from people in this neighborhood or residents in this neighborhood asking about placing a stop line on the ground next to the stop signs.

899
01:22:05,971 --> 01:22:08,352
[SPEAKER_43]: This is a, it seems like with the

900
01:22:09,802 --> 01:22:21,510
[SPEAKER_43]: So many people using Waze now, the app that sends people through neighborhoods that, you know, there's increased traffic and there's a lot of kids in this area that traverse back and forth to the Roberts Elementary School.

901
01:22:21,950 --> 01:22:24,352
[SPEAKER_43]: And so this is a safety issue that needs to be addressed.

902
01:22:24,372 --> 01:22:35,580
[SPEAKER_43]: So if we could have a stop line placed on both ends of that street in the matter of, in the interest of public safety, I'd greatly appreciate it.

903
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:39,784
[SPEAKER_43]: And if we could actually forward this to the Traffic Commission for their approval as well.

904
01:22:40,485 --> 01:22:43,167
[SPEAKER_25]: On the motion by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Knight.

905
01:22:43,187 --> 01:22:43,868
[SPEAKER_25]: All those in favor?

906
01:22:44,449 --> 01:22:44,549
[SPEAKER_25]: Aye.

907
01:22:44,649 --> 01:22:47,772
[SPEAKER_25]: Motion passes.

908
01:22:47,792 --> 01:22:49,814
[SPEAKER_25]: 17-767 Offered by Vice President Motz.

909
01:22:49,874 --> 01:22:57,081
[SPEAKER_25]: We have resolved that Hustle Road be discussed regarding its use as a staging area, parking lot, and dumping ground for the Rose Street

910
01:22:57,742 --> 01:23:07,737
[SPEAKER_25]: Water Main project be it further resolved that the city solicitor write report back to the count of the ownership of the wooden land abutted the train tracks on Bustle Road.

911
01:23:08,158 --> 01:23:09,159
[SPEAKER_25]: Vice President Mox.

912
01:23:10,372 --> 01:23:11,333
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you Mr. President.

913
01:23:11,373 --> 01:23:16,377
[SPEAKER_20]: This is regarding the water main work that's being done on Grove Street currently.

914
01:23:17,558 --> 01:23:27,106
[SPEAKER_20]: Many residents on Bustle Road were unaware that their particular road, which many people are probably familiar with, which runs right off of Grove Street,

915
01:23:28,527 --> 01:23:44,669
[SPEAKER_20]: was going to be used as the staging area for heavy equipment, was going to be used for dumping of dirt and debris that was dug from the trenching of the water main work that's going on, and the wooded area that abuts

916
01:23:45,430 --> 01:23:58,653
[SPEAKER_20]: the street and the train tracks, the city of Medford for many years told residents that that's not their property and they have no ownership of that land and the MBTA claims that it's not their property.

917
01:23:59,113 --> 01:24:14,317
[SPEAKER_20]: So I think it's only appropriate that we get a response back from the city solicitor to find out who actually owns that particular piece of land, the wooded land that runs from Grove and Bustle all the way down to Century Street Extension.

918
01:24:15,375 --> 01:24:18,938
[SPEAKER_20]: on Bustle Road, Mr. President, to see who has ownership.

919
01:24:19,379 --> 01:24:40,718
[SPEAKER_20]: I would also ask that in the future, when projects are being done, that wherever the staging area may be, even though it's not on the street where the work is currently taking place, that those residents also be notified that you're going to have heavy equipment, construction material, and anything else that's going to be placed on your road for a number of months.

920
01:24:41,138 --> 01:24:44,381
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that's important, Mr. President, that people get notified.

921
01:24:44,842 --> 01:25:01,939
[SPEAKER_20]: So that would be my motion, Mr. President, that the residents receive an update on when this equipment will be removed from Bustle and also that the city solicitor report back of ownership of the wooded area along the tracks.

922
01:25:02,239 --> 01:25:02,519
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

923
01:25:03,260 --> 01:25:03,641
[SPEAKER_20]: Good evening.

924
01:25:03,661 --> 01:25:05,123
[SPEAKER_19]: Name and address of the record, please.

925
01:25:05,163 --> 01:25:07,866
[SPEAKER_19]: Tom Lincoln, 27 Gleason Street.

926
01:25:08,848 --> 01:25:15,096
[SPEAKER_19]: Just coincidentally, I went by there the other day, and there's an astonishing amount of equipment there.

927
01:25:15,937 --> 01:25:19,121
[SPEAKER_19]: It's actually starting to edge into the wooded area itself.

928
01:25:19,702 --> 01:25:24,085
[SPEAKER_19]: I think the question about ownership is quite interesting, but I think that will be resolved.

929
01:25:24,105 --> 01:25:30,971
[SPEAKER_19]: But I would be concerned about the appearance of the property once the equipment is removed.

930
01:25:31,571 --> 01:25:40,238
[SPEAKER_19]: Just as an analogy, they've used a corner of Placed at Park that's quite near the parking near the train station in West Medford, that's been used.

931
01:25:40,758 --> 01:25:42,680
[SPEAKER_19]: on and off for staging of various projects.

932
01:25:42,901 --> 01:25:52,290
[SPEAKER_19]: And I have to say, I haven't monitored it assiduously, but it doesn't look as nice as it looked as part of a park as it did five years ago.

933
01:25:52,630 --> 01:26:00,138
[SPEAKER_19]: And Bustle Road, that's a nice wooded area that also provides a good sound barrier for the trains on people on Bustle Road.

934
01:26:00,358 --> 01:26:00,619
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks.

935
01:26:00,919 --> 01:26:01,219
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

936
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:02,840
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Knight.

937
01:26:03,601 --> 01:26:06,062
[SPEAKER_28]: Mr. President, I think Mr. Lincoln took the words right out of my mouth.

938
01:26:06,202 --> 01:26:13,266
[SPEAKER_28]: I'd like to amend the paper to request that the public contractor, upon conclusion of the project, conduct a cleanup of the area along Bustle Road as well.

939
01:26:15,026 --> 01:26:18,328
[SPEAKER_28]: Provided the sponsor of the resolve has no problem with that.

940
01:26:19,089 --> 01:26:19,409
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

941
01:26:20,129 --> 01:26:20,609
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Marksley.

942
01:26:27,967 --> 01:26:48,677
[SPEAKER_20]: Also, Mr. President, if the city has a memorandum of understanding with this particular contractor, I'd like to see a copy of that and to see if there was any language included for a staging area and mitigation regarding the cleaning up of the particular land after the debris and heavy equipment is removed.

943
01:26:49,495 --> 01:26:49,755
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

944
01:26:50,716 --> 01:26:58,964
[SPEAKER_25]: On the motion by Vice President Marks, as amended by Councilor Knight, and as further amended again by Councilor Marks.

945
01:26:59,705 --> 01:27:01,046
[SPEAKER_25]: Seconded by Councilor Knight.

946
01:27:01,106 --> 01:27:01,807
[SPEAKER_25]: All those in favor?

947
01:27:01,827 --> 01:27:02,167
[SPEAKER_25]: Aye.

948
01:27:02,868 --> 01:27:03,969
[SPEAKER_25]: Motion passes.

949
01:27:04,690 --> 01:27:06,171
[SPEAKER_25]: Communications from the Mayor.

950
01:27:08,013 --> 01:27:08,293
[SPEAKER_25]: Where?

951
01:27:08,634 --> 01:27:09,455
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, sorry.

952
01:27:09,515 --> 01:27:12,718
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't have my sign.

953
01:27:13,672 --> 01:27:24,683
[SPEAKER_25]: 17768, authored by Vice President Mox, be it resolved that the electronic speed sign be placed on Bustle Road due to the speeding cut-through traffic in the interest of public safety.

954
01:27:25,024 --> 01:27:26,205
[SPEAKER_25]: Vice President Mox.

955
01:27:27,046 --> 01:27:28,027
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. President.

956
01:27:28,247 --> 01:27:44,157
[SPEAKER_20]: The same gentleman that called me regarding the staging area also mentioned the fact that Bustle Road for many years, not just now, is being used as a cut-through for people that are coming from Playstead Road that want to get on to Grove and vice versa.

957
01:27:44,917 --> 01:27:59,240
[SPEAKER_20]: And this is only compounding the issue when you have, as Mr. Lincoln mentioned, heavy equipment on the street, which narrows the road, and you have cars that are speeding down that very bumpy, narrow road.

958
01:28:00,101 --> 01:28:14,044
[SPEAKER_20]: So in the interest of public safety, I'd ask that one of the two electronic speed signs be placed on either end of Bustle Road to alert people that are going down Bustle what the speed limit is, Mr. President.

959
01:28:14,644 --> 01:28:15,065
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

960
01:28:16,247 --> 01:28:19,153
[SPEAKER_25]: The motion by Vice President Mark, seconded by Councilor Layton.

961
01:28:19,173 --> 01:28:19,854
[SPEAKER_25]: All those in favor?

962
01:28:20,556 --> 01:28:21,417
[SPEAKER_25]: Motion passes.

963
01:28:21,437 --> 01:28:23,000
[SPEAKER_25]: 17-764, communications from the Mayor.

964
01:28:29,557 --> 01:28:47,588
[SPEAKER_25]: Dear Mr. President and city councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approves the appropriation of free cash in the amount of $200,000.00 to fund the Brooks Estate Carriage House Stabilization.

965
01:28:47,789 --> 01:28:54,133
[SPEAKER_25]: Stabilization includes, it is not limited to repairs to walls, provide watertight building envelope,

966
01:28:55,173 --> 01:28:58,876
[SPEAKER_25]: stable structure, roofing, new decking, and chimney repointing.

967
01:28:59,016 --> 01:29:06,060
[SPEAKER_25]: The balance of free cash prior to this vote is $8,788,941.

968
01:29:06,120 --> 01:29:15,807
[SPEAKER_25]: Tom Lincoln and Mark Warren, members of the Medford Brooks Estate Land and Belt are present to answer any of the council's questions regarding this matter.

969
01:29:16,267 --> 01:29:17,928
[SPEAKER_25]: Good evening, name and address for the record.

970
01:29:17,968 --> 01:29:23,309
[SPEAKER_19]: Tom Lincoln, 27 Gleason Street, forgive my voice, I'm recovering from some dental surgery.

971
01:29:25,310 --> 01:29:29,631
[SPEAKER_19]: This issue has been in the background for quite some time.

972
01:29:31,112 --> 01:29:38,895
[SPEAKER_19]: Just as a point of interest, 2017 marks the 75th year of public ownership of the Brooks Estate by the people of Medford.

973
01:29:40,095 --> 01:29:45,197
[SPEAKER_19]: As you know, this is a property that was preserved permanently by the city council and the

974
01:29:47,178 --> 01:29:51,301
[SPEAKER_19]: The city of Medford has been owned for 75 years, since 1942.

975
01:29:51,981 --> 01:30:07,272
[SPEAKER_19]: Our organization, working with the city and other parties, has worked for almost 20 years to bring back the property from a rather sad state, and the Carriage House is key to that effort.

976
01:30:07,833 --> 01:30:09,894
[SPEAKER_19]: We thought, in the interest of

977
01:30:11,075 --> 01:30:20,844
[SPEAKER_19]: Advancing this question that we'd ask our new board member Mark Warren, who is the mayor's new appointment to the inbuilt board to speak on the matter.

978
01:30:21,085 --> 01:30:24,568
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Carr and I will be available for questions also.

979
01:30:24,668 --> 01:30:25,028
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

980
01:30:27,991 --> 01:30:28,732
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Mr. Lincoln.

981
01:30:29,528 --> 01:30:30,128
[SPEAKER_13]: Good morning, Mr. President.

982
01:30:30,148 --> 01:30:30,429
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening.

983
01:30:30,489 --> 01:30:31,469
[SPEAKER_25]: Name and address on the record, please.

984
01:30:31,629 --> 01:30:33,871
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, Mark Warren, 16 Chestnut Street.

985
01:30:35,152 --> 01:30:40,095
[SPEAKER_13]: I am the mayor's new representative to the board, the land trust.

986
01:30:40,215 --> 01:30:44,258
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is her motion, so we thought we'd be appropriate if I presented it.

987
01:30:46,260 --> 01:30:49,041
[SPEAKER_13]: You probably also are tired of hearing Tom Lincoln and Doug Carr.

988
01:30:51,839 --> 01:30:53,720
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not just a parrot for them.

989
01:30:53,880 --> 01:30:57,041
[SPEAKER_13]: I have my own opinions about the estate.

990
01:30:57,061 --> 01:31:08,926
[SPEAKER_13]: While we're in total agreement on the need for this $200,000, it's critically necessary funding to prevent the carriage house from total collapse.

991
01:31:10,047 --> 01:31:12,347
[SPEAKER_13]: I see things a little differently than them.

992
01:31:12,367 --> 01:31:20,831
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think they may see this $200,000 as a one-time expenditure with only one real benefit, saving the carriage house.

993
01:31:21,431 --> 01:31:22,312
[SPEAKER_13]: I think differently.

994
01:31:22,352 --> 01:31:31,178
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that this $200,000 will also be able to reduce the amount that we'll have to spend eventually on the restoration.

995
01:31:32,299 --> 01:31:36,502
[SPEAKER_13]: We're calling for a repointing of walls and things like that that I don't think will need to be done twice.

996
01:31:36,922 --> 01:31:38,804
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's just a very little thing.

997
01:31:38,844 --> 01:31:42,446
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's an example of where I differ a bit from Tom and Doug.

998
01:31:42,466 --> 01:31:43,247
[SPEAKER_13]: Now,

999
01:31:48,662 --> 01:31:53,823
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that more of a few of you had promised the voters that you were going to avoid wasteful spending.

1000
01:31:53,883 --> 01:31:58,204
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'd like you to look at this not as wasteful, and it's also not spending.

1001
01:31:58,244 --> 01:31:59,364
[SPEAKER_13]: It's more of an investment.

1002
01:31:59,804 --> 01:32:03,625
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's an investment that has a very real return on investment.

1003
01:32:04,245 --> 01:32:09,786
[SPEAKER_13]: It has a return on investment for both the city and for the local businesses.

1004
01:32:10,406 --> 01:32:16,868
[SPEAKER_13]: And I have an example of benefits to local businesses that I'd like to share with you.

1005
01:32:19,608 --> 01:32:24,791
[SPEAKER_13]: You may have noticed the Appalachian Mountain Club sign on the corner of Oak Street some evenings.

1006
01:32:25,291 --> 01:32:35,195
[SPEAKER_13]: When the Appalachian Mountain Club sold their headquarters on Beacon Hill, moved to Charlestown, they kind of forgot to have meeting space in the new headquarters.

1007
01:32:35,615 --> 01:32:36,896
[SPEAKER_13]: So they had to shop around.

1008
01:32:36,956 --> 01:32:38,516
[SPEAKER_13]: I was part of the committee.

1009
01:32:38,536 --> 01:32:39,477
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm very active with them.

1010
01:32:39,997 --> 01:32:45,300
[SPEAKER_13]: I was part of the committee that was looking in Newton and Somerville and other places in Boston.

1011
01:32:45,320 --> 01:32:52,525
[SPEAKER_13]: We finally settled on the First Baptist Church in Medford because, as was noted before, Medford's a happening place.

1012
01:32:52,625 --> 01:32:54,206
[SPEAKER_13]: It's really convenient to get to.

1013
01:32:54,906 --> 01:32:56,647
[SPEAKER_13]: And the church is about 50 yards from my house.

1014
01:33:00,383 --> 01:33:02,644
[SPEAKER_13]: We've met there four times so far.

1015
01:33:02,664 --> 01:33:04,666
[SPEAKER_13]: About 500 people have come so far.

1016
01:33:05,526 --> 01:33:11,610
[SPEAKER_13]: We've ordered over 60 pizzas and over 10 Greek salads from Rose's on High Street.

1017
01:33:12,371 --> 01:33:15,813
[SPEAKER_13]: The Millennials, the young members group, is soon going to start using it.

1018
01:33:15,833 --> 01:33:19,455
[SPEAKER_13]: And they're going to be looking for a sit-down restaurant to go to after their meetings.

1019
01:33:20,138 --> 01:33:33,627
[SPEAKER_13]: The Korean barbecue, you know, all you can eat place will be, Sura, will be very, you know, popular with them and they'll see a real uptick in business as well as the other local sit-down restaurants.

1020
01:33:34,267 --> 01:33:39,271
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's just one example of, you know, where meetings can benefit the local business.

1021
01:33:39,391 --> 01:33:40,031
[SPEAKER_13]: Weddings, too.

1022
01:33:40,532 --> 01:33:42,933
[SPEAKER_13]: Weddings will have a need for catering, they'll have a need

1023
01:33:44,743 --> 01:33:48,365
[SPEAKER_13]: limousines, they'll have a need for tents, other equipment like that.

1024
01:33:49,186 --> 01:33:52,488
[SPEAKER_13]: These are things that the business benefits that the business community will get.

1025
01:33:52,928 --> 01:33:58,691
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, the city will also get the benefit of not having

1026
01:34:00,945 --> 01:34:09,728
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, the drag that the city building, the manor and the carriage house, and they're a drag on the budget right now.

1027
01:34:10,468 --> 01:34:19,591
[SPEAKER_13]: However, if the carriage house can be restored to where it can start hosting weddings and meetings and things like that, it'll start generating revenue.

1028
01:34:19,631 --> 01:34:24,013
[SPEAKER_13]: And a good example of another, what I hope will be our competition,

1029
01:34:25,313 --> 01:34:30,976
[SPEAKER_13]: A building similar to the Brooks Estate Manor is the Whittemore Robins House over in Arlington.

1030
01:34:31,656 --> 01:34:38,059
[SPEAKER_13]: That building is totally self-sustaining just from the revenue from weddings.

1031
01:34:38,519 --> 01:34:44,422
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, a wedding over there cost about $2,000, which if you know anybody who's gotten married recently, it's a real bargain.

1032
01:34:45,483 --> 01:34:50,805
[SPEAKER_13]: I had one of my weddings over there, and I'm pretty cheap, and that's why we chose them.

1033
01:34:54,577 --> 01:35:00,060
[SPEAKER_13]: The Whittemore Robins House has two drawbacks that the Brooks Estate Carriage House does not have or will not have.

1034
01:35:00,701 --> 01:35:04,283
[SPEAKER_13]: One, you can only fit about 66 people in the two rooms.

1035
01:35:04,703 --> 01:35:07,325
[SPEAKER_13]: What they have are two rooms and an archway in the middle.

1036
01:35:07,845 --> 01:35:09,326
[SPEAKER_13]: They can have a capacity of about 66 people.

1037
01:35:12,573 --> 01:35:16,835
[SPEAKER_13]: The Brooks Estate will have a greater capacity and the Brooks Estate will have parking.

1038
01:35:17,235 --> 01:35:22,717
[SPEAKER_13]: There's no available parking at the Whittemore Robins House, except for a few handicapped spots right behind the library.

1039
01:35:23,437 --> 01:35:29,820
[SPEAKER_13]: But we'll see significantly more revenue from weddings and meetings at the Brooks Estate

1040
01:35:30,540 --> 01:35:33,741
[SPEAKER_13]: But we've also got significantly more expenses.

1041
01:35:34,221 --> 01:35:43,503
[SPEAKER_13]: We've got two properties, two buildings to maintain, and the overhead associated with them is greater than the overhead for the one Wintermore Robins house.

1042
01:35:44,203 --> 01:35:47,724
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll also have to pay off the bonds that'll be needed for restoration.

1043
01:35:48,464 --> 01:35:51,744
[SPEAKER_13]: Those are expenses that the Wintermore Robins house doesn't have.

1044
01:35:52,325 --> 01:35:54,185
[SPEAKER_13]: However, the expense of

1045
01:35:54,986 --> 01:36:02,117
[SPEAKER_13]: maintaining the manor is something we're going to have anyway, whether we have the income from the carriage house or not.

1046
01:36:02,778 --> 01:36:07,024
[SPEAKER_13]: So it makes sense to get the revenue from the carriage house.

1047
01:36:07,064 --> 01:36:09,608
[SPEAKER_13]: And the only way we can do that is if we save the carriage house.

1048
01:36:10,650 --> 01:36:16,094
[SPEAKER_13]: If it's continued in its current state, it's probably not going to last the winter.

1049
01:36:16,114 --> 01:36:23,801
[SPEAKER_13]: If we get a winter like we had a couple of years ago with unprecedented amounts of snow, it's probably going to be history without this funding.

1050
01:36:23,901 --> 01:36:27,064
[SPEAKER_13]: So I see your decision tonight as kind of binary.

1051
01:36:27,584 --> 01:36:39,594
[SPEAKER_13]: You can either authorize the $200,000 disbursement from free cash and save the only source of revenue, or you could waste the money that's already been put into the manor and into the estate.

1052
01:36:40,195 --> 01:36:53,947
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a pretty clear choice that if we want to continue the manor as a viable institution and the estate as a viable institution, we need to save that carriage house.

1053
01:36:55,003 --> 01:36:55,624
[SPEAKER_25]: Any questions?

1054
01:36:55,684 --> 01:36:55,984
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

1055
01:36:56,404 --> 01:36:57,245
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Dello Russo?

1056
01:36:57,785 --> 01:36:59,006
[SPEAKER_25]: Move approval, Mr. President.

1057
01:37:00,527 --> 01:37:01,208
[SPEAKER_43]: Councilor Falco?

1058
01:37:02,209 --> 01:37:02,989
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1059
01:37:03,009 --> 01:37:04,770
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you, Mr. Warren, for your presentation.

1060
01:37:04,790 --> 01:37:06,392
[SPEAKER_43]: Just a couple of quick questions here.

1061
01:37:07,172 --> 01:37:10,995
[SPEAKER_43]: So, in the description, it mentions all the work that needs to be done.

1062
01:37:11,616 --> 01:37:16,479
[SPEAKER_43]: If this was to pass tonight, do you know how long it would take to do all that work?

1063
01:37:17,440 --> 01:37:20,101
[SPEAKER_13]: Is this going to happen over a long time span?

1064
01:37:20,421 --> 01:37:20,662
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

1065
01:37:21,002 --> 01:37:22,342
[SPEAKER_13]: It may go into the spring.

1066
01:37:22,362 --> 01:37:26,404
[SPEAKER_13]: But we have to get up two by six supporting walls.

1067
01:37:26,424 --> 01:37:28,846
[SPEAKER_13]: We have to get supports for the roof and trusses.

1068
01:37:29,546 --> 01:37:33,968
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe Tom and Doug can speak more exactly about how quickly it can be done.

1069
01:37:34,568 --> 01:37:39,831
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's work that would have to start immediately to save it from the impact of this winter.

1070
01:37:41,032 --> 01:37:41,252
Thank you.

1071
01:37:43,228 --> 01:37:44,730
[SPEAKER_07]: Doug Carr, 124 Boston Ave.

1072
01:37:44,770 --> 01:37:59,882
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Falco, this is probably about a six-week process to execute the plans that you've seen by a couple contractors, so we want to get it started obviously before the winter really starts, but they can do this work largely during the winter as well.

1073
01:38:00,642 --> 01:38:05,144
[SPEAKER_43]: Do you know how much it would cost to totally rehabilitate the carriage house?

1074
01:38:05,724 --> 01:38:07,424
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's grown.

1075
01:38:07,505 --> 01:38:13,707
[SPEAKER_07]: It grows every year by between $1,500,000 with inflation, but it's between $1.5 and $2 million total.

1076
01:38:14,707 --> 01:38:15,787
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the carriage house.

1077
01:38:15,847 --> 01:38:18,008
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the carriage house restoration, just the carriage house.

1078
01:38:18,068 --> 01:38:20,529
[SPEAKER_07]: The master plan has a detailed cost estimate in it.

1079
01:38:24,110 --> 01:38:26,211
[SPEAKER_43]: So I've only been on the council for about two years now.

1080
01:38:26,751 --> 01:38:40,059
[SPEAKER_43]: And during that time, we talked about the Brooks Estate a little bit here and there, but this is, I think, the first time that something's come before me to appropriate money for the Brooks Estate.

1081
01:38:40,659 --> 01:38:42,700
[SPEAKER_43]: And I would agree with Mr. Warren.

1082
01:38:42,760 --> 01:38:45,082
[SPEAKER_43]: The way I look at this, this is an investment.

1083
01:38:45,522 --> 01:38:47,103
[SPEAKER_43]: If we own it, we should embrace it.

1084
01:38:48,188 --> 01:38:51,170
[SPEAKER_43]: And we own it, and we should be embracing this.

1085
01:38:51,190 --> 01:38:53,551
[SPEAKER_43]: This is a project that I think that's good.

1086
01:38:53,571 --> 01:38:55,792
[SPEAKER_43]: I think, in my opinion, there's a lot of potential here.

1087
01:38:56,372 --> 01:38:58,133
[SPEAKER_43]: There's a lot of potential.

1088
01:38:58,573 --> 01:38:59,834
[SPEAKER_43]: I've scanned the business plan.

1089
01:38:59,854 --> 01:39:01,255
[SPEAKER_43]: I think that was the master plan.

1090
01:39:01,995 --> 01:39:02,855
[SPEAKER_43]: I've seen that before.

1091
01:39:02,875 --> 01:39:07,177
[SPEAKER_43]: And I think that there's a lot of potential with this property.

1092
01:39:08,798 --> 01:39:10,019
[SPEAKER_43]: It's a long-term investment, yes.

1093
01:39:10,099 --> 01:39:11,700
[SPEAKER_43]: But if we own it, we should be investing in it.

1094
01:39:12,280 --> 01:39:15,121
[SPEAKER_43]: It doesn't do us any good to let it rot away in the woods.

1095
01:39:16,842 --> 01:39:19,784
[SPEAKER_43]: As time goes by, it only becomes more expensive to fix it.

1096
01:39:20,364 --> 01:39:22,506
[SPEAKER_43]: So it's an investment that I think we should be making.

1097
01:39:22,526 --> 01:39:25,688
[SPEAKER_43]: I second the resolution tonight.

1098
01:39:26,328 --> 01:39:28,089
[SPEAKER_43]: And thank you for your time.

1099
01:39:28,349 --> 01:39:28,629
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

1100
01:39:28,690 --> 01:39:29,030
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you.

1101
01:39:30,411 --> 01:39:30,991
[SPEAKER_28]: Councilor Knight.

1102
01:39:31,892 --> 01:39:32,552
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, Mr. President.

1103
01:39:32,572 --> 01:39:33,272
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you very much.

1104
01:39:33,392 --> 01:39:35,294
[SPEAKER_28]: This is for any one of you gentlemen.

1105
01:39:35,794 --> 01:39:40,957
[SPEAKER_28]: About how much money does the Medford Brooks Estate Land Trust have in its coffers at this point?

1106
01:39:41,357 --> 01:39:41,958
[SPEAKER_19]: We have about $60,000.

1107
01:39:42,158 --> 01:39:45,000
[SPEAKER_19]: I would like to make one other point.

1108
01:39:45,940 --> 01:39:49,462
[SPEAKER_19]: About the manor if I might the manor is very far along.

1109
01:39:50,022 --> 01:39:55,945
[SPEAKER_19]: We've been working with the Mackey group the artist group We've had some they've had some events there.

1110
01:39:56,645 --> 01:40:02,287
[SPEAKER_19]: We're hoping to work on a regular basis Just in terms of community outreach.

1111
01:40:02,347 --> 01:40:08,990
[SPEAKER_19]: We're doing some walks now with the walk Medford group I don't know how familiar you are with them, but they are absolutely fabulous in terms of

1112
01:40:10,531 --> 01:40:11,032
[SPEAKER_19]: of energy.

1113
01:40:11,713 --> 01:40:16,940
[SPEAKER_19]: The other issue about the carriage house is that this also buys time.

1114
01:40:16,980 --> 01:40:27,393
[SPEAKER_19]: We understand that the entire funding package is not at hand at this point, and we've advanced the project on many other fronts in the interim.

1115
01:40:28,755 --> 01:40:35,980
[SPEAKER_19]: But with stabilization, it gives you the opportunity to restore the carriage house.

1116
01:40:36,021 --> 01:40:43,606
[SPEAKER_19]: You reach a certain point, and we've talked about this quite frequently, you reach a certain point, that opportunity is gone.

1117
01:40:43,666 --> 01:40:47,569
[SPEAKER_19]: The investment is no longer there.

1118
01:40:48,210 --> 01:40:48,530
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1119
01:40:49,150 --> 01:40:49,531
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

1120
01:40:49,831 --> 01:40:55,155
[SPEAKER_28]: Also, Mr. President, are the renovations to the manor finally complete and it's at its final end state?

1121
01:40:56,336 --> 01:41:00,198
[SPEAKER_19]: Basically, the, we've done a long list of things.

1122
01:41:00,538 --> 01:41:10,863
[SPEAKER_19]: Remember, the manor was in very, very bad shape when the council passed the preservation and conservation, conservation preservation restriction in 1998.

1123
01:41:12,484 --> 01:41:17,407
[SPEAKER_19]: We've secured a new roof, five chimneys, 70 windows with shutters.

1124
01:41:18,407 --> 01:41:21,049
[SPEAKER_19]: We paid for a new boiler.

1125
01:41:21,689 --> 01:41:23,410
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that was $18,000.

1126
01:41:24,510 --> 01:41:29,452
[SPEAKER_19]: The building is handicap accessible, which includes a lift to the second floor.

1127
01:41:30,112 --> 01:41:31,673
[SPEAKER_19]: We've replaced the veranda.

1128
01:41:32,093 --> 01:41:34,434
[SPEAKER_19]: We've replaced the west porch.

1129
01:41:34,454 --> 01:41:37,395
[SPEAKER_19]: I think I'm more concerned about what isn't done than what has been done.

1130
01:41:37,475 --> 01:41:45,238
[SPEAKER_19]: What is not done is painting and a little bit of woodwork on the second and third floor trim.

1131
01:41:49,501 --> 01:41:56,607
[SPEAKER_19]: Some smaller amenities, for example, we're putting in shades and drapes in some of the rooms.

1132
01:41:57,308 --> 01:41:59,890
[SPEAKER_19]: And maybe Mr. Carr can think of some other things here.

1133
01:42:00,130 --> 01:42:01,652
[SPEAKER_19]: Has the plumbing issue been addressed up there?

1134
01:42:02,693 --> 01:42:05,256
[SPEAKER_28]: I know there was a plumbing issue that was going on.

1135
01:42:06,118 --> 01:42:12,406
[SPEAKER_19]: The water supply passes the test, if that's the right word.

1136
01:42:13,488 --> 01:42:15,370
[SPEAKER_19]: The pressure is not very good.

1137
01:42:15,811 --> 01:42:16,692
[SPEAKER_19]: It's certainly adequate.

1138
01:42:17,433 --> 01:42:18,654
[SPEAKER_19]: for current needs.

1139
01:42:19,755 --> 01:42:32,844
[SPEAKER_19]: It's interesting that the Grove Street project was mentioned because the water pressure in this whole area, both on the Playstead Road side and the Grove Street side, I think this is quite common across Medford actually, is not great.

1140
01:42:33,684 --> 01:42:39,889
[SPEAKER_19]: As we've discussed before, the other issue here is the actual drive, the access drive, which is 1,900 feet from Grove Street.

1141
01:42:42,090 --> 01:42:49,934
[SPEAKER_19]: And it makes eminent sense to, when that is redone, to furnish a new water line at the same time.

1142
01:42:50,654 --> 01:42:51,254
[SPEAKER_19]: It's very interesting.

1143
01:42:51,274 --> 01:42:52,455
[SPEAKER_19]: There was a discussion here earlier.

1144
01:42:52,475 --> 01:42:54,576
[SPEAKER_28]: So when we flush the toilets, it still goes into the leaching?

1145
01:42:54,656 --> 01:42:56,837
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, yes, it does.

1146
01:42:59,418 --> 01:43:02,099
[SPEAKER_19]: But this is not a commercial building at this point.

1147
01:43:02,279 --> 01:43:02,739
[SPEAKER_28]: And then we go.

1148
01:43:02,859 --> 01:43:04,720
[SPEAKER_28]: So it's the 75th anniversary this year.

1149
01:43:05,500 --> 01:43:08,102
[SPEAKER_28]: So what type of programming do we have coming out of there now that we have the?

1150
01:43:09,277 --> 01:43:18,405
[SPEAKER_28]: manner renovations near completion, do we have any type of snowshoeing, after school programs for kids, bird watching, anything like that?

1151
01:43:18,465 --> 01:43:25,071
[SPEAKER_19]: The road is an impediment to certain heavier uses, and that's just a fact of life at this point.

1152
01:43:25,952 --> 01:43:29,795
[SPEAKER_19]: We've had speaking programs, I mentioned we're working with the Mackey

1153
01:43:31,637 --> 01:43:35,780
[SPEAKER_19]: We've had a number of open houses, walking tours.

1154
01:43:35,860 --> 01:43:42,304
[SPEAKER_19]: We've worked with the Victorian Society, which also is very interested in the Episcopal Church in your neighborhood, sir.

1155
01:43:46,407 --> 01:43:51,428
[SPEAKER_19]: So, you know, we're and of course the property is not just two historic buildings.

1156
01:43:51,528 --> 01:44:11,573
[SPEAKER_19]: It's it's a 50 acres of conserved Habitat open space, which it gets a lot of daily usage We've had relationships with Tufts for our work days We've done and hope to do more Boy Scout what you call a Eagle Scout projects and we're certainly hoping to

1157
01:44:14,454 --> 01:44:18,098
[SPEAKER_19]: do more on all these fronts.

1158
01:44:18,238 --> 01:44:20,400
[SPEAKER_19]: This is such a multifaceted project.

1159
01:44:20,420 --> 01:44:23,864
[SPEAKER_28]: Do we have trails mapped out there so people can come and pick up a map?

1160
01:44:23,884 --> 01:44:24,525
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a free trail map.

1161
01:44:27,668 --> 01:44:28,108
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, go ahead.

1162
01:44:28,388 --> 01:44:29,609
[SPEAKER_28]: And trail maintenance is being done.

1163
01:44:29,809 --> 01:44:45,238
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we're looking to go after some CPA funds, not only to design the road, because the road, as Councilor Mark has commented several times, could be done earlier with parking and the utilities in advance of the entire restoration.

1164
01:44:46,779 --> 01:44:52,063
[SPEAKER_07]: We could do that, which will actually open up for a lot more public usage of this property and the buildings.

1165
01:44:52,923 --> 01:44:56,766
[SPEAKER_07]: The carriage house presently has no utilities at all right now for anything.

1166
01:44:56,786 --> 01:45:00,409
[SPEAKER_07]: So obviously that would be done when the building was done.

1167
01:45:00,449 --> 01:45:06,634
[SPEAKER_07]: But we think there's a great opportunity not only with CPA funds for the trails as well, but the road, the trails.

1168
01:45:07,095 --> 01:45:08,436
[SPEAKER_07]: But CPA won't pay for maintenance.

1169
01:45:09,136 --> 01:45:10,157
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just a part of the fact.

1170
01:45:10,858 --> 01:45:13,840
[SPEAKER_07]: It has to be capital improvement and public benefit.

1171
01:45:13,860 --> 01:45:14,721
[SPEAKER_07]: It can't be for maintenance.

1172
01:45:14,761 --> 01:45:17,543
[SPEAKER_07]: This is clearly just pure maintenance at the point.

1173
01:45:17,683 --> 01:45:20,486
[SPEAKER_07]: Otherwise, we wouldn't be going for the CPA funds for this very cost.

1174
01:45:21,935 --> 01:45:22,515
[SPEAKER_07]: Any other questions?

1175
01:45:22,675 --> 01:45:22,915
Thank you.

1176
01:45:39,657 --> 01:45:57,744
[SPEAKER_10]: most desirable sites in Medford when you talk about history and what the Brooks State talks about the Brooks Manor and the Carriage House and making sure that we continue with that and making sure that

1177
01:45:59,245 --> 01:46:02,946
[SPEAKER_10]: our kids' kids can follow with what we're trying to do here in Medford.

1178
01:46:03,686 --> 01:46:27,012
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the pieces that I wanted to bring along is as we had our discussions last year and looking into the recreation, full-time recreation program, and you look at the partnerships that, you know, I personally use in my community with recreation and look to see what kind of funding we can bring for both organizations, I think is a plus in the community I work for.

1179
01:46:27,492 --> 01:46:28,752
[SPEAKER_10]: And looking at the Brooks Estates,

1180
01:46:30,396 --> 01:46:35,252
[SPEAKER_10]: Excuse me, the Brooks, the manor and the carriage house, it was one of the biggest.

1181
01:46:37,232 --> 01:46:39,973
[SPEAKER_10]: attractions when we talked to different constituents.

1182
01:46:40,513 --> 01:46:50,735
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know that Councilor Knight mentioned it, but you talk about the trails, you talk about the area and what recreation really means.

1183
01:46:50,775 --> 01:47:02,278
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not just parks and playing games anymore, but when you're talking about snowshoeing and trail walking and then fishing and the other issues that

1184
01:47:02,738 --> 01:47:15,213
[SPEAKER_10]: people don't realize when you talk about nature and getting out and bird watching and covering insects.

1185
01:47:15,513 --> 01:47:18,797
[SPEAKER_10]: There's so many out-of-the-box thinking and using

1186
01:47:21,393 --> 01:47:24,814
[SPEAKER_10]: this wonderful location as a jumping point.

1187
01:47:24,894 --> 01:47:32,656
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that it's a historical piece, but this is new life that could be fed off that.

1188
01:47:32,696 --> 01:47:34,057
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm really excited about it.

1189
01:47:34,137 --> 01:47:35,017
[SPEAKER_19]: I greatly appreciate it.

1190
01:47:35,037 --> 01:47:38,818
[SPEAKER_19]: I forgot to mention, we have done some walks for young children.

1191
01:47:39,598 --> 01:47:41,219
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sorry, I can't remember the name.

1192
01:47:41,939 --> 01:47:44,060
[SPEAKER_19]: Actually, it's a preschool in West Medford.

1193
01:47:44,080 --> 01:47:45,300
[SPEAKER_19]: I think they used to run out.

1194
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:50,264
[SPEAKER_19]: It's, no, yeah, I'm sorry, yeah, that sort of thing.

1195
01:47:50,864 --> 01:48:00,753
[SPEAKER_19]: We've also thought a lot about, there's been some wonderful things going on in the Fells vis-a-vis the high school, and this is exactly the same kind of environment as the Fells in terms of some of the

1196
01:48:01,593 --> 01:48:04,377
[SPEAKER_19]: issues of invasives and that sort of thing.

1197
01:48:04,457 --> 01:48:13,869
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's always a matter of, with this kind of programming, of finding the passionate person, the person that has the knowledge.

1198
01:48:13,909 --> 01:48:16,252
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, I'm not capable of talking about the

1199
01:48:17,333 --> 01:48:18,314
[SPEAKER_19]: ecological detail.

1200
01:48:18,394 --> 01:48:20,835
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not Brooks' Day, but somebody certainly is.

1201
01:48:21,115 --> 01:48:27,279
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think it's important to remember, too, that a lot of people have been benefiting from this property for years.

1202
01:48:27,739 --> 01:48:29,080
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, they take their daily walk.

1203
01:48:29,120 --> 01:48:30,241
[SPEAKER_19]: They get away from Medford.

1204
01:48:30,581 --> 01:48:34,043
[SPEAKER_19]: And the last thing I want to mention on the history side is that it's not just the Brooks family.

1205
01:48:34,183 --> 01:48:36,904
[SPEAKER_19]: In fact, you know, this is not a monument to the Brooks family.

1206
01:48:37,225 --> 01:48:42,788
[SPEAKER_19]: What this is, is a monument to, and a reminder of 300 years of Medford history.

1207
01:48:43,228 --> 01:48:48,719
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, there were 200 veterans' families living at the Brooks Estate from 1946 to 1954.

1208
01:48:49,160 --> 01:48:51,724
[SPEAKER_19]: Many of their descendants are still in Medford.

1209
01:48:51,744 --> 01:48:52,406
[SPEAKER_19]: We know a lot of them.

1210
01:48:52,606 --> 01:48:55,011
[SPEAKER_19]: In fact, we did a reunion some years ago.

1211
01:48:56,785 --> 01:48:57,966
[SPEAKER_19]: in 1996, actually.

1212
01:48:59,207 --> 01:49:02,210
[SPEAKER_19]: And so this is a living history kind of thing.

1213
01:49:02,410 --> 01:49:08,275
[SPEAKER_19]: It's really something that we felt, we've always felt very strongly belongs to the people that own it.

1214
01:49:08,655 --> 01:49:13,619
[SPEAKER_19]: And we worked, I think, really hard to make that come alive.

1215
01:49:13,939 --> 01:49:15,581
[SPEAKER_19]: I only say that, I would only say that

1216
01:49:16,161 --> 01:49:20,366
[SPEAKER_19]: If we knew how big this project was when we started, we might be thinking differently.

1217
01:49:20,406 --> 01:49:21,848
[SPEAKER_19]: But we're right in the middle of it.

1218
01:49:21,868 --> 01:49:22,148
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1219
01:49:22,188 --> 01:49:24,170
[SPEAKER_10]: So John and I see the easy part.

1220
01:49:24,210 --> 01:49:25,792
[SPEAKER_10]: So this wasn't a big deal.

1221
01:49:25,832 --> 01:49:26,974
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm not going to say that.

1222
01:49:27,955 --> 01:49:31,779
[SPEAKER_10]: But again, we've all preached our historical sites and how important they are to Medford.

1223
01:49:32,380 --> 01:49:34,963
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think this is the granddaddy of them all.

1224
01:49:35,003 --> 01:49:36,544
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you for all your hard work.

1225
01:49:37,705 --> 01:49:39,066
[SPEAKER_20]: Vice President Mox.

1226
01:49:40,027 --> 01:49:41,008
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1227
01:49:42,990 --> 01:49:46,913
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not aware of any other capital plan that's going on in the community currently.

1228
01:49:47,613 --> 01:50:04,608
[SPEAKER_20]: And maybe if the people that spoke at the podium are aware of another capital plan that may be out there that we're going to be talking about not only shoring up and buttoning up the potential carriage house from collapsing, but

1229
01:50:05,958 --> 01:50:10,282
[SPEAKER_20]: maybe a capital improvement plan that we've discussed several years back for the site?

1230
01:50:11,142 --> 01:50:28,156
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, we have updated, this has actually happened last year at this point, earlier this year, updated some of the numbers from the master plan and presented that to the mayor at her request.

1231
01:50:28,977 --> 01:50:29,898
[SPEAKER_19]: And we have not heard

1232
01:50:31,699 --> 01:50:34,922
[SPEAKER_19]: you know, whether there is, you know, another five-year capital plan.

1233
01:50:35,603 --> 01:50:43,671
[SPEAKER_19]: As you recall, this was part of the laundry list, if that's the right word, of capital items a few years ago.

1234
01:50:43,691 --> 01:50:51,779
[SPEAKER_19]: And so I honestly don't have any other knowledge than that in terms of, but it's certainly, we would certainly advocate

1235
01:50:54,001 --> 01:51:06,639
[SPEAKER_19]: You know as a public facility and as a something that's been known by the city for a long time that we'd be part of that process when it happens Thank you Mr. President

1236
01:51:08,129 --> 01:51:16,895
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, I've been involved in this process for a number of years and was part of the discussion when the Brooks Estate's master plan was presented to the council.

1237
01:51:17,655 --> 01:51:22,058
[SPEAKER_20]: And I thought at that time the plan really

1238
01:51:23,619 --> 01:51:26,461
[SPEAKER_20]: was forthcoming and a lot of due diligence went into the plan.

1239
01:51:27,161 --> 01:51:43,712
[SPEAKER_20]: And at the time, I think as a compromise, because I don't think the support was there to do the manor and the carriage house, was to work on the road, which I think was at the time a million two or a million three, or maybe a little more than that.

1240
01:51:44,993 --> 01:51:48,475
[SPEAKER_20]: And to me, the road is the fundamental issue here.

1241
01:51:49,255 --> 01:51:52,818
[SPEAKER_20]: Because right now, I'd ask anyone in the community trying to get up there,

1242
01:51:53,558 --> 01:51:59,750
[SPEAKER_20]: It's extremely, extremely difficult, unless you're in a four-wheel vehicle, to get up to that site.

1243
01:52:00,863 --> 01:52:01,404
[SPEAKER_20]: It really is.

1244
01:52:01,504 --> 01:52:04,506
[SPEAKER_20]: And I don't think I'm, you know, playing this up.

1245
01:52:04,966 --> 01:52:06,908
[SPEAKER_20]: It's very difficult to get up to the site.

1246
01:52:07,689 --> 01:52:18,618
[SPEAKER_20]: And I, as one member of the council, think if, you know, we're going to do anything or talk about plans for the Brooks Estates, we have to look at the infrastructure leading up to the Brooks Estates.

1247
01:52:19,479 --> 01:52:25,063
[SPEAKER_20]: And if that's an issue, that should be part of a capital plan that we should be discussing.

1248
01:52:26,324 --> 01:52:31,427
[SPEAKER_20]: And, you know, I'm not opposed to making sure the carriage house doesn't fall down.

1249
01:52:31,447 --> 01:52:37,410
[SPEAKER_20]: I appreciate the significance, historical significance of that property and maintaining the property.

1250
01:52:38,011 --> 01:52:44,915
[SPEAKER_20]: But in all good conscience, you know, and I'm sure the people that have been involved with the Brooks estates don't like to hear it.

1251
01:52:45,855 --> 01:52:57,242
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, when I hear from firefighters saying, how can you sink money into this and not address concerns we've been bringing up about our fire stations throughout the community, what do I say to that?

1252
01:52:58,943 --> 01:53:05,907
[SPEAKER_20]: I say that we need a capital plan to address not only this issue, but the other issues we've been hearing about.

1253
01:53:06,587 --> 01:53:14,231
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, when you hear firefighters say that the HVA system doesn't work, when you hear them saying that windows don't open or close,

1254
01:53:15,252 --> 01:53:25,099
[SPEAKER_20]: When you hear them talking in the main headquarters about deplorable conditions, which I viewed firsthand of the showers in the restrooms in the headquarters.

1255
01:53:25,880 --> 01:53:32,665
[SPEAKER_20]: When you talk about the bunker gear, we still have new washes that they purchased.

1256
01:53:33,325 --> 01:53:34,787
[SPEAKER_20]: But they didn't purchase the dryers.

1257
01:53:35,388 --> 01:53:42,118
[SPEAKER_20]: So they have to air dry the new bunker gear, which takes many, many more extended hours to air dry the bunker gear.

1258
01:53:42,679 --> 01:53:43,821
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, these are just a few.

1259
01:53:44,121 --> 01:53:47,426
[SPEAKER_20]: The fire alarm system on Salem Street doesn't work.

1260
01:53:48,327 --> 01:53:50,650
[SPEAKER_20]: You go into the kitchen, there's a hole in the floor.

1261
01:53:51,492 --> 01:53:57,440
[SPEAKER_20]: These are where men and women are spending seven days a week, 24 hours a day, Mr. President.

1262
01:53:57,700 --> 01:54:02,507
[SPEAKER_20]: And I don't want to cloud the issue with the Brooks estates, because I think they should run on its own merit.

1263
01:54:03,248 --> 01:54:09,354
[SPEAKER_20]: But how do we stand up here in good faith and vote for $200,000 without having a meeting on this?

1264
01:54:09,394 --> 01:54:15,059
[SPEAKER_20]: This is the first meeting, Mr. President, and I'm glad Councilor Dello Russo feels comfortable to move forward on this.

1265
01:54:15,420 --> 01:54:28,392
[SPEAKER_20]: I know he's been a big advocate of the Brooks estates over the years, and I know he feels comfortable, Mr. President, but I don't know how much of the $200,000 is going to go towards just the capping off of the building so it doesn't pour inside the building.

1266
01:54:28,672 --> 01:54:34,238
[SPEAKER_20]: how much is gonna go towards the repointing of the chimney, how much is gonna go towards the decking and so forth.

1267
01:54:34,598 --> 01:54:43,106
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that'd be interesting to know when we're almost spending a quarter of a million dollars on what it's gonna be spent on, Mr. President, and what we expect.

1268
01:54:44,027 --> 01:54:54,889
[SPEAKER_20]: Is this going to be buttoned up for the next 10 years or is it possible that there is a capital plan coming down in six months from now and we're going to have to take the envelope off the building after spending $200,000?

1269
01:54:55,609 --> 01:55:07,072
[SPEAKER_20]: And I realize and I appreciate some of the issues that you brought up, sir, about potential upgrades to or somewhat upgrades to the Carriage House that could be used down the line.

1270
01:55:07,612 --> 01:55:12,073
[SPEAKER_20]: But these are the things, Mr. President, that I'm struggling with on

1271
01:55:12,533 --> 01:55:22,557
[SPEAKER_20]: looking at other infrastructure needs in the community and saying, hey, wait a minute, you know, we do have a carriage house that's in deplorable condition, that's on the verge of collapse.

1272
01:55:23,617 --> 01:55:31,981
[SPEAKER_20]: And we remember last time we had another building called the DPW building in the city that was in terrible condition and condemned by the Board of Health.

1273
01:55:33,682 --> 01:55:36,783
[SPEAKER_20]: And I don't want to go in that direction with our fire stations.

1274
01:55:37,818 --> 01:55:40,140
[SPEAKER_20]: And we're at that level on many of these buildings.

1275
01:55:41,280 --> 01:55:55,150
[SPEAKER_20]: And I can't in good faith vote for any package right now until I see a capital plan that's outlined, Mr. President, that not only addresses this important issue, but every other capital issue in the city.

1276
01:55:55,690 --> 01:55:57,411
[SPEAKER_20]: And it goes to roads and sidewalks.

1277
01:55:57,652 --> 01:56:05,277
[SPEAKER_20]: We all sit behind this railing and say, oh, we want the sidewalks, we want the potholes, but we're not putting any money, we're not putting any investment into it.

1278
01:56:07,350 --> 01:56:15,436
[SPEAKER_20]: This is a worthy issue, Mr. President, but I'm not going to jump on it tonight, and I'm not going to be under any political pressure to jump on this tonight, Mr. President.

1279
01:56:15,816 --> 01:56:21,120
[SPEAKER_20]: We were told last year by the proponents that this building wasn't going to last through the winter.

1280
01:56:22,061 --> 01:56:27,585
[SPEAKER_20]: If I'm not mistaken, I think that was a direct quote when they asked for money to buckle it up last year.

1281
01:56:27,966 --> 01:56:29,287
[SPEAKER_20]: It might have even been two years ago.

1282
01:56:29,727 --> 01:56:30,387
[SPEAKER_20]: Was it two years?

1283
01:56:30,828 --> 01:56:32,089
[SPEAKER_20]: And it wasn't going to last through winter.

1284
01:56:32,649 --> 01:56:33,830
[SPEAKER_20]: Two winters have gone by.

1285
01:56:34,311 --> 01:56:35,793
[SPEAKER_20]: The building's still standing, I'm sure.

1286
01:56:35,813 --> 01:56:40,017
[SPEAKER_20]: It's probably in less wear for the good.

1287
01:56:40,037 --> 01:56:44,623
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think that's a fair assessment of the situation.

1288
01:56:44,643 --> 01:56:45,364
[SPEAKER_07]: That's your opinion.

1289
01:56:45,384 --> 01:56:46,625
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it is my opinion.

1290
01:56:46,665 --> 01:56:47,906
[SPEAKER_20]: Right, you're entitled to your opinion.

1291
01:56:47,987 --> 01:56:48,908
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm making a statement.

1292
01:56:52,083 --> 01:56:53,324
[SPEAKER_25]: So Mr. President, as I stated, you know,

1293
01:57:06,915 --> 01:57:17,798
[SPEAKER_20]: This shouldn't be a quick knee-jerk reaction of $200,000 to spend when we have so many other issues that are confronting infrastructure issues in our community.

1294
01:57:18,078 --> 01:57:19,178
[SPEAKER_20]: I just pointed out a few.

1295
01:57:19,518 --> 01:57:21,138
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not going to go through a laundry list of them.

1296
01:57:21,578 --> 01:57:29,400
[SPEAKER_20]: But if we get presented with a capital plan that makes sense, that addresses the current needs, I'll be on board.

1297
01:57:29,680 --> 01:57:30,661
[SPEAKER_20]: We have over $8 million.

1298
01:57:30,681 --> 01:57:31,501
[SPEAKER_20]: You read it in the paper.

1299
01:57:31,981 --> 01:57:33,341
[SPEAKER_20]: $8 million in free cash out there.

1300
01:57:33,661 --> 01:57:36,782
[SPEAKER_20]: We can address a lot of needs, Mr. President, and this is one of them.

1301
01:57:37,383 --> 01:57:38,644
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think it should be addressed.

1302
01:57:39,505 --> 01:57:40,967
[SPEAKER_20]: But let's not do the piecemeal.

1303
01:57:41,287 --> 01:57:47,794
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's not forget what we talked about last year and the year before, that we're going to get piecemealed to death on issues.

1304
01:57:48,215 --> 01:57:50,537
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, here's the next issue that the mayor wants to present.

1305
01:57:50,777 --> 01:57:52,399
[SPEAKER_20]: Here's the piecemeal issue.

1306
01:57:52,940 --> 01:57:55,182
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's present a capital plan that makes sense.

1307
01:57:55,543 --> 01:57:57,104
[SPEAKER_20]: The homework is done on this project.

1308
01:57:57,705 --> 01:58:01,809
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't think Mr. Link and Mr. Carr, I don't think they have to go back and do the homework on this project.

1309
01:58:02,129 --> 01:58:06,193
[SPEAKER_20]: They presented a project that, in my opinion, is worthy of debate and discussion.

1310
01:58:06,593 --> 01:58:07,454
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's talk about it.

1311
01:58:07,994 --> 01:58:09,516
[SPEAKER_20]: We're talking about revitalizing it.

1312
01:58:09,536 --> 01:58:19,365
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, buttoning up the carriage house, in my opinion, sounds good, might make you feel good, but does it address really the issue and the needs of the Brooks estates?

1313
01:58:20,580 --> 01:58:22,221
[SPEAKER_20]: I, you may think so.

1314
01:58:22,482 --> 01:58:23,082
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't think so.

1315
01:58:23,422 --> 01:58:26,425
[SPEAKER_20]: I think we have to look at a larger picture on this project.

1316
01:58:27,065 --> 01:58:36,673
[SPEAKER_20]: And I, for one, am not prepared tonight, Mr. President, to support this paper unless I see a full capital plan on the needs of this community.

1317
01:58:37,834 --> 01:58:46,562
[SPEAKER_20]: And also, if the Brooks Estates has 60,000 that they were able to raise, that, some of that portion of that money should go towards the buckling up of this building.

1318
01:58:47,700 --> 01:58:49,341
[SPEAKER_20]: That's what they're raising money for.

1319
01:58:49,381 --> 01:58:51,162
[SPEAKER_20]: That's what the intent is.

1320
01:58:51,802 --> 01:58:55,865
[SPEAKER_20]: And if that's the case, fine, but that's not what we were presented tonight.

1321
01:58:55,925 --> 01:59:00,527
[SPEAKER_20]: It's 200,000 of free cash to do that, Mr. President.

1322
01:59:00,607 --> 01:59:02,288
[SPEAKER_20]: So those are my comments.

1323
01:59:02,928 --> 01:59:10,413
[SPEAKER_20]: I'd love to hear from the members that kept this Brooks Estates alive for so many years.

1324
01:59:11,233 --> 01:59:14,214
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, this is truly a volunteer basis.

1325
01:59:14,694 --> 01:59:21,917
[SPEAKER_20]: Otherwise, this building would be the same faith as many of our other city-owned buildings in the community, which would be rubble.

1326
01:59:23,397 --> 01:59:25,078
[SPEAKER_20]: So those are my comments, Mr. President.

1327
01:59:26,093 --> 01:59:28,515
[SPEAKER_25]: Mr. Warren, would you like to address some of the council's comments?

1328
01:59:28,535 --> 01:59:28,735
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I can.

1329
01:59:28,755 --> 01:59:31,357
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm new, but I can address many of them.

1330
01:59:31,897 --> 01:59:41,685
[SPEAKER_13]: You're totally right about the road, and we're going to be seeking CPA money to rebuild that, to look for the design first, and then to be rebuilding that.

1331
01:59:42,065 --> 01:59:43,566
[SPEAKER_13]: And that'll be in the spring.

1332
01:59:43,626 --> 01:59:45,768
[SPEAKER_13]: When is the funding for CPA?

1333
01:59:45,808 --> 01:59:47,810
[SPEAKER_13]: It'll occur in the spring.

1334
01:59:47,930 --> 01:59:54,134
[SPEAKER_20]: So the road is not maintenance, but the building, the carriage house is considered maintenance.

1335
01:59:54,355 --> 01:59:55,616
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, it's deferred maintenance.

1336
01:59:55,696 --> 01:59:57,597
[SPEAKER_13]: We can't use the CPA funding for that.

1337
01:59:58,578 --> 02:00:00,099
[SPEAKER_13]: It has to come from free cash.

1338
02:00:00,479 --> 02:00:05,143
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not a capital investment as maintenance.

1339
02:00:05,783 --> 02:00:09,046
[SPEAKER_13]: A capital investment is the sort of thing we would have to float a bond for.

1340
02:00:09,653 --> 02:00:12,594
[SPEAKER_13]: Or, you know, if we can, use CPA money.

1341
02:00:12,634 --> 02:00:13,774
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be the preferred route.

1342
02:00:14,094 --> 02:00:15,094
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1343
02:00:15,494 --> 02:00:24,156
[SPEAKER_13]: But where this isn't a capital investment, and by the way, if you'd like, I have the exact numbers for, you know, the repairs, and I can summarize them for you if you'd like.

1344
02:00:24,796 --> 02:00:26,996
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, I think that'd be helpful to pass out to the council.

1345
02:00:27,016 --> 02:00:27,476
[SPEAKER_20]: Sure.

1346
02:00:27,896 --> 02:00:29,437
[SPEAKER_13]: I only have one copy with me, but.

1347
02:00:29,957 --> 02:00:31,217
[SPEAKER_20]: City messenger can make a copy.

1348
02:00:32,937 --> 02:00:34,878
[SPEAKER_13]: One, you know, I can go through it.

1349
02:00:34,958 --> 02:00:36,038
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't need my time.

1350
02:00:36,557 --> 02:00:48,693
[SPEAKER_13]: But some things like the plywood, it looks like it's a huge dollar item, but every window in that carriage house has to be boarded up using a special T111 plywood that's exterior grade.

1351
02:00:48,713 --> 02:00:49,614
[SPEAKER_13]: It's pretty expensive stuff.

1352
02:00:55,950 --> 02:01:05,728
[SPEAKER_13]: But the idea that we have to just study this and study it, the problem is we've had two, I don't know what was said two years ago.

1353
02:01:05,768 --> 02:01:06,249
[SPEAKER_13]: I wasn't here.

1354
02:01:08,417 --> 02:01:13,979
[SPEAKER_13]: But assuming they did say that it was going to fall down that winter, we've had two very, very light winters.

1355
02:01:14,539 --> 02:01:17,040
[SPEAKER_13]: The winter before that was huge.

1356
02:01:17,060 --> 02:01:18,021
[SPEAKER_13]: It was record setting.

1357
02:01:18,621 --> 02:01:22,062
[SPEAKER_13]: If we have a winter like that again, I can guarantee you that it's going to fall down.

1358
02:01:22,102 --> 02:01:27,524
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, when I first went out there before I'd been appointed, I wanted to be able to tell the mayor I'd at least been out there.

1359
02:01:28,004 --> 02:01:31,046
[SPEAKER_13]: And I saw the building, and I thought it was a total knockdown.

1360
02:01:31,086 --> 02:01:32,286
[SPEAKER_13]: It was total loss already.

1361
02:01:35,967 --> 02:01:37,427
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't think that was a big deal.

1362
02:01:37,467 --> 02:01:41,688
[SPEAKER_13]: You could build a new modern structure there that would be much more efficient.

1363
02:01:42,128 --> 02:01:43,509
[SPEAKER_13]: Then I did a little research.

1364
02:01:43,569 --> 02:01:45,969
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's much easier to do research now.

1365
02:01:45,989 --> 02:01:47,749
[SPEAKER_13]: I used to be an attorney for the city of Boston.

1366
02:01:48,149 --> 02:01:50,690
[SPEAKER_13]: And it was much more difficult to research things back then.

1367
02:01:50,750 --> 02:02:00,172
[SPEAKER_13]: But now you just go on Wikipedia, and you can see, in 1998, a conservation and preservation restriction was put on the property that would require us.

1368
02:02:00,232 --> 02:02:02,973
[SPEAKER_13]: We can't just put up a new structure.

1369
02:02:03,033 --> 02:02:05,233
[SPEAKER_13]: We have to rebuild the existing structure.

1370
02:02:07,565 --> 02:02:10,888
[SPEAKER_13]: Financially, that's unfortunate, but we're preserving the history.

1371
02:02:10,908 --> 02:02:16,333
[SPEAKER_13]: Like the Whittemore Robins House, it's a really rich part of the Medford history.

1372
02:02:16,393 --> 02:02:19,676
[SPEAKER_13]: There's this Arlington history.

1373
02:02:20,436 --> 02:02:21,998
[SPEAKER_13]: The historic value is huge.

1374
02:02:22,717 --> 02:02:37,660
[SPEAKER_13]: and if we don't get the $200,000 in funding, we may not have a second chance to restore that new carriage house to the point where it creates revenue and it's paying for the manor, it's helping out local businesses.

1375
02:02:37,940 --> 02:02:39,261
[SPEAKER_13]: We may not get that chance again.

1376
02:02:39,881 --> 02:02:41,161
[SPEAKER_13]: This may be a one-shot deal.

1377
02:02:42,121 --> 02:02:48,242
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe two years from now, without funding it, maybe it'll hold up.

1378
02:02:48,943 --> 02:02:50,283
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe not though, probably not.

1379
02:02:51,460 --> 02:03:00,743
[SPEAKER_20]: Don't you agree it's a sad commentary at this point after all these years we're talking about just buckling up and trying to save a building from falling down after all these years.

1380
02:03:01,283 --> 02:03:07,965
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's why I say we need to even though the proposal didn't go through a few years ago this needs to be revisited again.

1381
02:03:08,425 --> 02:03:10,025
[SPEAKER_20]: This, we have to have a direction.

1382
02:03:10,366 --> 02:03:11,486
[SPEAKER_20]: Where are we going with this?

1383
02:03:11,926 --> 02:03:13,086
[SPEAKER_20]: We have to have a direction.

1384
02:03:13,106 --> 02:03:20,008
[SPEAKER_13]: I agree that the MAS plan really has to be looked at and should, you know, ultimately, you know, be funded, but hopefully funded in phases.

1385
02:03:20,048 --> 02:03:20,969
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's not going to kill.

1386
02:03:21,009 --> 02:03:24,349
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm also a taxpayer here now, but a couple of years, you're right.

1387
02:03:24,449 --> 02:03:30,131
[SPEAKER_13]: It is sad that we've come to this point, but think too, we've saved a lot of money by not doing that maintenance.

1388
02:03:30,251 --> 02:03:32,492
[SPEAKER_13]: It was essentially an abandoned building for years.

1389
02:03:33,012 --> 02:03:33,192
[SPEAKER_34]: I mean,

1390
02:03:33,940 --> 02:03:39,945
[SPEAKER_13]: If you tried to maintain every abandoned building in the city, you know, you wouldn't have as much free cash as you have now.

1391
02:03:40,745 --> 02:03:43,387
[SPEAKER_13]: So for a while, it was an abandoned building.

1392
02:03:43,407 --> 02:03:44,608
[SPEAKER_13]: It had no real purpose.

1393
02:03:45,008 --> 02:03:46,810
[SPEAKER_13]: It had no real plans for it.

1394
02:03:47,210 --> 02:03:48,951
[SPEAKER_13]: But now there is a real purpose.

1395
02:03:49,131 --> 02:03:50,112
[SPEAKER_13]: People want to save it.

1396
02:03:50,152 --> 02:03:51,453
[SPEAKER_13]: People want the history.

1397
02:03:52,033 --> 02:04:00,780
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's vital to, you know, stabilize it now and use some of those funds that we saved from years past when we didn't do any maintenance to it.

1398
02:04:01,607 --> 02:04:07,248
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's why I'm thinking it's a good investment now, just looking at it from a financial standpoint.

1399
02:04:08,728 --> 02:04:09,168
[SPEAKER_13]: But you're right.

1400
02:04:09,228 --> 02:04:12,509
[SPEAKER_13]: We do have to look more closely at funding the whole thing.

1401
02:04:13,209 --> 02:04:18,090
[SPEAKER_13]: And then it'll be a very wise investment.

1402
02:04:18,290 --> 02:04:19,470
[SPEAKER_07]: If I could just add on that.

1403
02:04:20,510 --> 02:04:28,852
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously, if we had passed the bond two or three years ago, the Carriage House would have been restored right now and actually generating money to pay off the debt.

1404
02:04:31,174 --> 02:04:33,720
[SPEAKER_07]: make so many more people be able to use it.

1405
02:04:33,740 --> 02:04:35,585
[SPEAKER_07]: I would just add a couple of things.

1406
02:04:37,669 --> 02:04:53,514
[SPEAKER_07]: when the city council funded a study to fix the carriage house, which was what we did, you guys did two years ago, it was so unsafe in there that they actually had to buy some wood and stabilize just a couple of things so they could do their job safely.

1407
02:04:54,054 --> 02:05:03,176
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why the building didn't fall down last year, because they had to actually do some temporary shoring just to be safe in the building itself.

1408
02:05:04,157 --> 02:05:04,377
[SPEAKER_07]: It is,

1409
02:05:05,605 --> 02:05:06,346
[SPEAKER_07]: It is condemned.

1410
02:05:06,826 --> 02:05:12,350
[SPEAKER_07]: It is not safe to go into that building today if you're not a professional like Paul Mulkey and other people.

1411
02:05:13,570 --> 02:05:18,594
[SPEAKER_07]: And yes, M-Belt has $60,000, but I feel like we're being held to a different standard.

1412
02:05:19,574 --> 02:05:24,778
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't ask the, no one asks the friends of the Medford Public Library to pay for the library roof when it leaks.

1413
02:05:25,458 --> 02:05:31,703
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know why M-Belt and the members of M-Belt, which have sunk over a quarter million dollars of private money,

1414
02:05:32,543 --> 02:05:32,723
[SPEAKER_07]: in St.

1415
02:05:32,743 --> 02:05:37,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Brooks Estate in the last 15 years, why we're being asked to do everything.

1416
02:05:38,525 --> 02:05:39,065
[SPEAKER_07]: Maintenance.

1417
02:05:39,545 --> 02:05:40,945
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's not fair.

1418
02:05:41,025 --> 02:05:43,286
[SPEAKER_07]: Nobody funds maintenance.

1419
02:05:43,446 --> 02:05:44,826
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the city's job.

1420
02:05:45,386 --> 02:05:46,647
[SPEAKER_07]: We all own this building.

1421
02:05:47,407 --> 02:05:48,087
[SPEAKER_07]: We go after grants.

1422
02:05:48,107 --> 02:05:48,767
[SPEAKER_07]: We've gotten grants.

1423
02:05:48,787 --> 02:05:52,088
[SPEAKER_07]: We've gotten over $400,000 in grant money in the last 10 years for the roof,

1424
02:05:56,291 --> 02:06:01,962
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is not just CDBG money, but I'm talking about Cummings Foundation, Mass Preservation Projects Funds.

1425
02:06:02,362 --> 02:06:03,525
[SPEAKER_07]: We've put our own money into it.

1426
02:06:03,705 --> 02:06:05,468
[SPEAKER_07]: But we can only take it so far.

1427
02:06:05,508 --> 02:06:07,432
[SPEAKER_07]: We need a partner in the city.

1428
02:06:08,168 --> 02:06:09,388
[SPEAKER_07]: And you guys have been there for us.

1429
02:06:09,448 --> 02:06:10,709
[SPEAKER_07]: You've given us a lot of money over the years.

1430
02:06:10,769 --> 02:06:12,870
[SPEAKER_07]: But clearly, the clock is ticking here.

1431
02:06:12,890 --> 02:06:17,932
[SPEAKER_07]: I just don't want the Brooksville State to be held hostage, because I agree, we need a police station.

1432
02:06:17,972 --> 02:06:18,692
[SPEAKER_07]: We need a fire station.

1433
02:06:18,712 --> 02:06:20,693
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's not a reason not to do this.

1434
02:06:21,373 --> 02:06:22,293
[SPEAKER_07]: We do need a capital plan.

1435
02:06:22,313 --> 02:06:23,394
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree with the Councilor.

1436
02:06:23,554 --> 02:06:25,975
[SPEAKER_07]: But we can't wait forever and ever.

1437
02:06:26,315 --> 02:06:32,817
[SPEAKER_07]: And every year, it becomes more and more expensive to restore this place, the road, the buildings.

1438
02:06:33,738 --> 02:06:34,758
[SPEAKER_07]: We just need to move forward.

1439
02:06:35,158 --> 02:06:35,458
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1440
02:06:36,039 --> 02:06:36,779
[SPEAKER_07]: Council Boxer, you're done?

1441
02:06:38,834 --> 02:06:41,691
[SPEAKER_19]: I also agree we need a capital plan, but I would point out that

1442
02:06:43,943 --> 02:06:47,044
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know how to say this, but it's not our job to create the capital plan.

1443
02:06:47,384 --> 02:06:52,706
[SPEAKER_19]: We've created a roadmap for the complete restoration of the estate.

1444
02:06:53,386 --> 02:06:56,107
[SPEAKER_19]: We did a tremendous amount of work on that.

1445
02:06:56,167 --> 02:06:57,248
[SPEAKER_19]: We're all volunteers.

1446
02:06:57,308 --> 02:07:00,229
[SPEAKER_19]: We paid for outside expertise.

1447
02:07:01,969 --> 02:07:07,511
[SPEAKER_19]: We have a very nuanced and deep understanding of the needs of the property.

1448
02:07:08,792 --> 02:07:11,933
[SPEAKER_19]: Unfortunately, with the Carriage House, this has been deferred.

1449
02:07:13,133 --> 02:07:14,134
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not just two years.

1450
02:07:14,514 --> 02:07:22,460
[SPEAKER_19]: This was in the capital plan, which is in the fall of 2011, and it was discussed quite a lot in the year and a half following that.

1451
02:07:22,480 --> 02:07:23,741
[SPEAKER_19]: I've kind of lost the chronology.

1452
02:07:25,042 --> 02:07:30,986
[SPEAKER_19]: So it should not be a surprise, I guess, is one way of saying it.

1453
02:07:33,928 --> 02:07:38,375
[SPEAKER_19]: It really, in the broader sense of things, this is buying time.

1454
02:07:39,016 --> 02:07:42,861
[SPEAKER_19]: I think Councilor Marks asked, when you button this up, what do you get?

1455
02:07:42,902 --> 02:07:44,123
[SPEAKER_19]: You get at least five years.

1456
02:07:44,163 --> 02:07:45,325
[SPEAKER_19]: You can probably get 10 years.

1457
02:07:45,866 --> 02:07:48,971
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm not an expert on it, but that's certainly not

1458
02:07:50,713 --> 02:07:56,358
[SPEAKER_19]: Unreasonable plan Unreasonable and we certainly ought to be able to have a capital plan in five years.

1459
02:07:56,378 --> 02:08:04,245
[SPEAKER_19]: I would hope and there's certainly a lot less Than that and the other thing is and this has been true from the get-go.

1460
02:08:04,826 --> 02:08:06,207
[SPEAKER_19]: This project is different and

1461
02:08:06,607 --> 02:08:10,092
[SPEAKER_19]: From a police station police stations absolutely critical.

1462
02:08:10,132 --> 02:08:24,329
[SPEAKER_19]: I'd be the first to say we should have had a new police station some time ago and you've seen the detailed problems there But this this unlike a police station this comes with a potential revenue stream with a way of paying off

1463
02:08:25,450 --> 02:08:44,963
[SPEAKER_19]: Bonds, we can't predict the future entirely, but it's certainly a model that's been used as we've said many times been used successfully all around the country for projects like this heritage projects projects benefit the community and The long the long term we've been in this for the long term I I

1464
02:08:45,823 --> 02:08:48,566
[SPEAKER_19]: Personally, did not expect to be working on this for 20 years.

1465
02:08:49,887 --> 02:08:53,610
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm 66, and I don't think I have another 20 years to work on it.

1466
02:08:54,170 --> 02:08:54,531
[SPEAKER_19]: I doubt.

1467
02:08:55,532 --> 02:08:56,372
[SPEAKER_19]: But maybe I'll be fine.

1468
02:08:56,993 --> 02:08:57,253
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry.

1469
02:08:58,094 --> 02:09:09,444
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's really, you know, I think as Mr. Carr has said, we've said that on this piece of this, this critical piece of this, the clock is ticking.

1470
02:09:09,484 --> 02:09:10,765
[SPEAKER_19]: This is a physical reality.

1471
02:09:12,046 --> 02:09:12,347
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

1472
02:09:17,433 --> 02:09:20,075
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

1473
02:09:20,575 --> 02:09:24,857
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to first thank the gentleman for the breakdown.

1474
02:09:25,137 --> 02:09:28,238
[SPEAKER_09]: That was going to be one of my questions, so getting a breakdown of the 200,000 helps.

1475
02:09:30,354 --> 02:09:39,626
[SPEAKER_09]: And then it was brought up that CPA funds can't be used for this, but there will be an application for monies from CPA for the design of the road.

1476
02:09:41,188 --> 02:09:44,292
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a, has the MBELT met or?

1477
02:09:45,302 --> 02:09:51,203
[SPEAKER_09]: with regards to almost like a five-year plan of what funds will be requested from CPA.

1478
02:09:51,223 --> 02:10:05,147
[SPEAKER_09]: And that is attached to not only how we'll proceed with applications to the CPA from the Brooks estates, but also just goes along with the whole issue of the capital plan and the mayor's

1479
02:10:05,727 --> 02:10:11,028
[SPEAKER_09]: vision for this in the future, because I guess at this point we're trying to buy time.

1480
02:10:11,088 --> 02:10:12,808
[SPEAKER_09]: But what are we buying time for?

1481
02:10:12,948 --> 02:10:15,329
[SPEAKER_09]: And number one, it's CPA funds.

1482
02:10:15,809 --> 02:10:18,509
[SPEAKER_09]: But number two, it's what is the mayor's plan?

1483
02:10:18,549 --> 02:10:20,870
[SPEAKER_09]: Because this did come before us.

1484
02:10:21,350 --> 02:10:22,510
[SPEAKER_09]: It went a certain way.

1485
02:10:22,750 --> 02:10:27,571
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this, I mean, we have the road for a million to a million and a half plus.

1486
02:10:27,651 --> 02:10:31,331
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we have to restore it would be another 1.5 to maybe 2.5 at that point.

1487
02:10:34,852 --> 02:10:37,513
[SPEAKER_09]: Where are we going with it is my main concern.

1488
02:10:38,593 --> 02:10:40,254
[SPEAKER_09]: So I guess that would be my first question.

1489
02:10:40,314 --> 02:10:42,675
[SPEAKER_09]: What is the plan for requesting CPA funds?

1490
02:10:43,455 --> 02:10:48,697
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, as you know, I sit on the CPA board, so I've seen firsthand how they put it together.

1491
02:10:48,837 --> 02:10:52,939
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been a really good master plan, and you all, I think, have received copies of it.

1492
02:10:54,439 --> 02:11:03,143
[SPEAKER_07]: The Brooks Estate was noted in there as a top priority for the city in the historic preservation, but also in the open space component, because it qualifies for both.

1493
02:11:04,083 --> 02:11:05,224
[SPEAKER_07]: And we will be competing for both.

1494
02:11:05,384 --> 02:11:07,685
[SPEAKER_07]: But obviously, we can't count on that money.

1495
02:11:08,626 --> 02:11:09,746
[SPEAKER_07]: It's competitive.

1496
02:11:10,347 --> 02:11:11,587
[SPEAKER_07]: There could be dozens of products.

1497
02:11:11,627 --> 02:11:13,668
[SPEAKER_07]: The city itself can compete for them, obviously.

1498
02:11:17,571 --> 02:11:26,576
[SPEAKER_07]: Since the plan just came out literally, the CPA plan came out literally only a week or two ago, our next board meeting, we're taking up this very subject.

1499
02:11:26,636 --> 02:11:29,317
[SPEAKER_07]: And we will be debating it and coming up with a strategy.

1500
02:11:31,138 --> 02:11:35,679
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously, put forward a project every single funding round for every year.

1501
02:11:36,859 --> 02:11:38,400
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll chip away at things that make sense.

1502
02:11:38,980 --> 02:11:42,581
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, obviously, you actually have the ability to bond with the CPA as well.

1503
02:11:42,641 --> 02:11:44,301
[SPEAKER_07]: That is one of the possibilities to do it.

1504
02:11:44,401 --> 02:11:48,382
[SPEAKER_07]: You still need the five votes that you need in this body, which you could do yourself, obviously.

1505
02:11:48,422 --> 02:11:58,124
[SPEAKER_07]: But there is, you know, over the next five years, we're talking about $7.5 million, but we don't have any illusions that we're going to get anywhere near that, or even a fraction of that, for obvious reasons.

1506
02:11:58,144 --> 02:11:59,665
[SPEAKER_07]: Because there's a lot of needs in this city.

1507
02:12:01,226 --> 02:12:04,711
[SPEAKER_07]: For affordable housing and open space and recreation up beyond historic preservation.

1508
02:12:04,791 --> 02:12:08,757
[SPEAKER_07]: So My answer is we don't have an answer right now, but we're working on it Councilor.

1509
02:12:09,278 --> 02:12:09,618
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you I

1510
02:12:17,763 --> 02:12:25,650
[SPEAKER_09]: So the first request, so you will put forward an application to the CPA on a yearly basis, which I expected anyway.

1511
02:12:25,670 --> 02:12:41,243
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess I was looking for more clarification on the amount, because when you're talking about a $4 million project, I want to know as a Councilor, is the CPA going to be able to fund this going forward, and if so,

1512
02:12:42,023 --> 02:12:44,325
[SPEAKER_25]: It's only $1.2 million.

1513
02:12:44,385 --> 02:12:45,005
[SPEAKER_09]: Correct.

1514
02:12:45,025 --> 02:12:48,427
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you do it in stages, is that going to be the plan of the CPA?

1515
02:12:48,447 --> 02:12:57,753
[SPEAKER_09]: Because like Mr. Carr said, there's going to be so many organizations that are going to be vying for that $1.2 million and whatever is added into it the next several years.

1516
02:12:58,333 --> 02:13:01,135
[SPEAKER_09]: So my main concern then is where the administration

1517
02:13:02,135 --> 02:13:02,855
[SPEAKER_09]: stands on this.

1518
02:13:03,516 --> 02:13:11,418
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that's something that we probably won't be able to get the answers to unless we hold off, whether that be a week or two, and ask the mayor to meet with us.

1519
02:13:12,138 --> 02:13:22,622
[SPEAKER_09]: Whether it be just on this one issue, set aside a half hour to meet with her, or if we can discuss an updated capital plan from the one we got two years ago.

1520
02:13:22,642 --> 02:13:25,002
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that it's time to do that.

1521
02:13:25,042 --> 02:13:27,163
[SPEAKER_09]: This council is going to be sitting for the next two years.

1522
02:13:27,643 --> 02:13:29,984
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it's time to do that before we do this.

1523
02:13:30,104 --> 02:13:31,504
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilman Marks makes good points.

1524
02:13:31,584 --> 02:13:36,605
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, you're talking police station, fire stations, library, a number of things that need to be done.

1525
02:13:36,665 --> 02:13:40,786
[SPEAKER_09]: And in the Brooks Estates, there's a number of different projects.

1526
02:13:41,406 --> 02:13:47,088
[SPEAKER_09]: But we are looked at as how can you approve certain money that may or not be, you know,

1527
02:13:48,099 --> 02:13:58,442
[SPEAKER_09]: just to keep something stable when we might be putting the library and the fire departments before that, and they're not going to expend the $3 million to do the Brooks Estates.

1528
02:13:58,702 --> 02:14:08,465
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to get a better understanding of where we're going moving forward and what the plan is, because it seems like the council's in support of this, which is fine.

1529
02:14:09,245 --> 02:14:14,066
[SPEAKER_09]: But I just want to know where we're going in the next couple of years and what is the plan.

1530
02:14:14,086 --> 02:14:15,567
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

1531
02:14:16,600 --> 02:14:17,200
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Knight.

1532
02:14:17,681 --> 02:14:21,703
[SPEAKER_28]: Mr. President, I would second Councilor Dello Russo's motion for approval.

1533
02:14:23,043 --> 02:14:27,466
[SPEAKER_25]: On the motion by Councilor Dello Russo, as seconded by Councilor Knight.

1534
02:14:27,506 --> 02:14:37,131
[SPEAKER_09]: I would first request that we have a motion to meet with the mayor in the next two weeks to discuss.

1535
02:14:37,151 --> 02:14:38,872
[SPEAKER_25]: Would you like to make that in the form of a motion?

1536
02:14:42,894 --> 02:14:44,495
[SPEAKER_25]: Do you want to make that in the form of a motion?

1537
02:14:46,079 --> 02:14:51,623
[SPEAKER_25]: On, well, we have a motion already on the floor for this vote.

1538
02:14:53,124 --> 02:14:55,185
[SPEAKER_25]: Mr. Councilor Del Rosario, do you want to rescind your motion?

1539
02:14:55,225 --> 02:14:56,526
[SPEAKER_25]: So, before Councilor Langers?

1540
02:14:56,946 --> 02:14:57,166
Not at all.

1541
02:14:57,186 --> 02:15:04,210
[SPEAKER_08]: I move to table the motion based on the first item appearing on the City Council agenda, first on our rules, and then move my motion forward.

1542
02:15:07,172 --> 02:15:11,155
[SPEAKER_25]: On the motion by Councilor Langers, the table of this motion, seconded by?

1543
02:15:14,728 --> 02:15:16,569
[SPEAKER_20]: It's the first time.

1544
02:15:17,050 --> 02:15:17,310
[SPEAKER_20]: Rule 20.

1545
02:15:17,350 --> 02:15:17,530
[SPEAKER_25]: Rule 20.

1546
02:15:17,570 --> 02:15:21,333
[SPEAKER_20]: Rule 20, any financial data.

1547
02:15:22,754 --> 02:15:32,721
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, and Councilor Lango-Kurt is invoking Rule 20, and this motion will be tabled for one week, correct?

1548
02:15:33,682 --> 02:15:34,883
[SPEAKER_09]: That's out of Section 22.

1549
02:15:34,963 --> 02:15:36,064
[SPEAKER_09]: We have to take a vote on Rule 20.

1550
02:15:37,725 --> 02:15:38,666
[SPEAKER_25]: We have to take a vote on the Rule 20.

1551
02:15:40,117 --> 02:15:46,283
[SPEAKER_25]: I think it's one week for section, yeah.

1552
02:15:46,704 --> 02:15:48,846
[SPEAKER_25]: It doesn't require, she can invoke that at any time.

1553
02:15:48,866 --> 02:15:52,009
[SPEAKER_25]: This has been tabled, this will be tabled for one week under section 20.

1554
02:16:07,418 --> 02:16:11,360
[SPEAKER_25]: And that the mayor, that's a separate motion.

1555
02:16:12,200 --> 02:16:12,560
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

1556
02:16:13,160 --> 02:16:13,461
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

1557
02:16:14,241 --> 02:16:19,743
[SPEAKER_25]: On the motion by Councilor Lungo-Koehn that we meet with the mayor to discuss the Brooks Estate issue.

1558
02:16:19,783 --> 02:16:21,244
[SPEAKER_25]: All those in, seconded by?

1559
02:16:23,205 --> 02:16:23,925
[SPEAKER_25]: Second.

1560
02:16:23,945 --> 02:16:25,005
[SPEAKER_25]: Seconded by Council Member Mox.

1561
02:16:25,065 --> 02:16:25,706
[SPEAKER_25]: All those in favor?

1562
02:16:28,047 --> 02:16:28,127
Aye.

1563
02:16:29,927 --> 02:16:32,548
[SPEAKER_25]: The chair seems to be in doubt.

1564
02:16:32,568 --> 02:16:33,789
[SPEAKER_25]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1565
02:16:40,193 --> 02:16:41,154
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Dela Ruccio.

1566

[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Kerr.

1572
02:16:46,160 --> 02:16:46,280
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes.

1573
02:16:47,001 --> 02:16:47,762
[SPEAKER_21]: Vice President March.

1574
02:16:47,802 --> 02:16:48,062
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1575
02:16:48,943 --> 02:16:49,744
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1576
02:16:49,764 --> 02:16:49,985

02:16:55,772 --> 02:16:56,853
[SPEAKER_25]: Two in the affirmative.

1581
02:16:57,293 --> 02:16:59,556
[SPEAKER_25]: I said two in the affirmative, five in the negative.

1582
02:16:59,656 --> 02:17:00,177
[SPEAKER_25]: Motion passed.

1583
02:17:04,007 --> 02:17:22,735
[SPEAKER_20]: I would respectfully ask of the President that any paper that appears before this Council for future agendas that is for a financial paper, that we set up a Committee of the Whole meeting, Mr. President, prior to any paper appearing on the Council agenda,

1584
02:17:23,435 --> 02:17:33,028
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, especially papers when you're talking hundreds of thousands of dollars need to be vetted out before this body takes a formal vote, Mr. President.

1585
02:17:33,088 --> 02:17:33,408
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1586
02:17:34,290 --> 02:17:40,718
[SPEAKER_25]: Motion to take papers in the hands of the clerk by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Knight.

1587
02:17:42,063 --> 02:17:42,683
[SPEAKER_25]: All those in favor?

1588
02:17:43,263 --> 02:17:44,124
[SPEAKER_25]: Motion passes.

1589
02:17:45,144 --> 02:17:53,426
[SPEAKER_25]: Offered by Councilor Scott Peli be it resolved that the City Council discuss the traffic issue on Oakland Street and connecting roadways.

1590
02:17:54,026 --> 02:17:56,307
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Scott Peli.

1591
02:17:56,367 --> 02:17:57,207
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1592
02:17:57,227 --> 02:17:59,208
[SPEAKER_10]: I know I got a few phone calls this morning.

1593
02:18:00,088 --> 02:18:09,991
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that the Traffic Commission did their due diligence with their study on Oakland Street and stopping the incoming traffic coming from North Medford.

1594
02:18:12,262 --> 02:18:25,827
[SPEAKER_10]: And that uses a cut through, but what we're seeing this morning, I believe, that there was a confrontation with two cars going opposite directions.

1595
02:18:27,848 --> 02:18:36,115
[SPEAKER_10]: could have escalated because of that being used as a cut-through and the neighboring roads as well.

1596
02:18:36,235 --> 02:18:40,719
[SPEAKER_10]: So I know if we could just ask the, if we could make a motion to ask the

1597
02:18:43,432 --> 02:19:02,338
[SPEAKER_10]: Chief in the Traffic Commission to give us a report of what has been done and what studies have been done to remedy that and see if we can look into making that a one-way if that's possible, but it's something that has to be looked at, so thank you.

1598
02:19:02,659 --> 02:19:02,979
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1599
02:19:03,379 --> 02:19:06,340
[SPEAKER_25]: On the motion by Councilor Scott Felly, seconded by Councilor Knight.

1600
02:19:06,760 --> 02:19:07,420
[SPEAKER_25]: All those in favour?

1601
02:19:08,020 --> 02:19:08,941
[SPEAKER_25]: Motion passes.

1602
02:19:10,021 --> 02:19:17,326
[SPEAKER_25]: Offered by Councilor Falco, be it resolved that the Traffic Commission consider making the Yale Street a do not enter between 7 a.m.

1603
02:19:17,346 --> 02:19:18,347
[SPEAKER_25]: and 9 a.m.

1604
02:19:18,387 --> 02:19:21,309
[SPEAKER_25]: in the interest of public safety.

1605
02:19:21,769 --> 02:19:22,770
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Falco.

1606
02:19:23,130 --> 02:19:23,931
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1607
02:19:24,251 --> 02:19:30,435
[SPEAKER_43]: I received a number of phone calls and emails about this once I had my

1608
02:19:31,636 --> 02:19:40,980
[SPEAKER_43]: The resolution I mentioned earlier tonight with regard to Brackett Street, and I guess there's a lot of speeding in that area and heavy traffic flow in the mornings.

1609
02:19:41,080 --> 02:19:50,084
[SPEAKER_43]: So I did talk to a number of residents about this and told them that I would bring this forward to, of course, be moved to the Traffic Commission for further review.

1610
02:19:51,124 --> 02:19:53,845
[SPEAKER_43]: It may actually have gone before than once before.

1611
02:19:54,005 --> 02:19:55,906
[SPEAKER_25]: It has been before the Traffic Commission before.

1612
02:19:56,186 --> 02:20:02,171
[SPEAKER_43]: I didn't know that for sure, but if we could actually have them look at it for reconsideration, I'd greatly appreciate it.

1613
02:20:03,212 --> 02:20:06,375
[SPEAKER_25]: On the motion by Councilor Palco, seconded by Councilor Knight.

1614
02:20:06,395 --> 02:20:09,017
[SPEAKER_28]: Is this yesterday's conversation?

1615
02:20:09,057 --> 02:20:11,939
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, it is.

1616
02:20:14,541 --> 02:20:14,762
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

1617
02:20:19,328 --> 02:20:21,509
[SPEAKER_25]: On the motion by Councilor Falco, all those in favor?

1618
02:20:21,849 --> 02:20:21,969
[SPEAKER_25]: Aye.

1619
02:20:22,489 --> 02:20:23,470
[SPEAKER_25]: Motion passes.

1620
02:20:24,430 --> 02:20:30,732
[SPEAKER_25]: Offered by Vice President Mox, be it resolved that the sidewalk at 128 Bonner Ave be replaced in the interest of public safety.

1621
02:20:30,792 --> 02:20:31,713
[SPEAKER_25]: Vice President Mox.

1622
02:20:32,473 --> 02:20:33,413
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1623
02:20:33,433 --> 02:20:43,737
[SPEAKER_20]: Just recently, an elderly woman fell on that sidewalk and did some damage to the side of her head, Mr. President, because of a sidewalk that is sticking up.

1624
02:20:44,097 --> 02:20:48,019
[SPEAKER_20]: So I would ask that that be repaired in the interest of public safety immediately.

1625
02:20:48,939 --> 02:20:49,300
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

1626
02:20:49,520 --> 02:20:52,122
[SPEAKER_25]: On the motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Lungo-Kearns.

1627
02:20:52,162 --> 02:20:52,823
[SPEAKER_25]: All those in favour?

1628
02:20:52,963 --> 02:20:53,083
[SPEAKER_25]: Aye.

1629
02:20:53,403 --> 02:20:54,264
[SPEAKER_25]: Motion passes.

1630
02:20:55,105 --> 02:21:08,618
[SPEAKER_25]: Offered by Vice President Mox, be it resolved that the potholes at the corner of Commercial and Riverside Ave be filled in the interest of public safety, and be it further resolved that the Medford Police Traffic Division review the tractor trailers parked on Commercial Street.

1631
02:21:08,658 --> 02:21:09,479
[SPEAKER_25]: Vice President Mox.

1632
02:21:10,119 --> 02:21:11,240
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1633
02:21:11,480 --> 02:21:17,222
[SPEAKER_20]: This is the second request for the potholes at the intersection of Riverside and Commercial.

1634
02:21:18,243 --> 02:21:31,809
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a parkmark of holes in that particular area, and it needs to be addressed, Mr. President, immediately before the winter comes, which we all know is going to create more problems with all those holes.

1635
02:21:32,289 --> 02:21:39,472
[SPEAKER_20]: Additionally, Mr. President, Commercial Street is now being used for tractor trailers to not only park

1636
02:21:39,852 --> 02:21:44,815
[SPEAKER_20]: their vehicles there, but also leave their whole trailer behind.

1637
02:21:45,455 --> 02:21:51,739
[SPEAKER_20]: So you'll see trailers sitting there for days on end that don't have a cab attached to them, which I believe is illegal.

1638
02:21:52,140 --> 02:22:05,768
[SPEAKER_20]: And I would ask that the police traffic division go out there, Mr. President, and see who's leaving these tractors behind and these trailers behind in the interest of public safety.

1639
02:22:06,188 --> 02:22:07,129
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1640
02:22:07,229 --> 02:22:09,330
[SPEAKER_25]: I had made the same call myself earlier in the week.

1641
02:22:10,311 --> 02:22:13,193
[SPEAKER_25]: On the motion by Vice President Mock, seconded by Councilor Falco.

1642
02:22:13,613 --> 02:22:14,313
[SPEAKER_25]: All those in favor?

1643
02:22:14,333 --> 02:22:14,754
[SPEAKER_25]: Aye.

1644
02:22:14,954 --> 02:22:15,974
[SPEAKER_25]: Motion passes.

[SPEAKER_25]: Offered by Councilor Knight.

1646
02:22:21,363 --> 02:22:32,687
[SPEAKER_25]: Be it resolved that the City Administration investigate and report back to the City Council whether there are any deeded restrictions on the parcel known as the Lawrence Memorial Hospital.

1647
02:22:32,747 --> 02:22:34,007
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Knight.

1648
02:22:34,087 --> 02:22:47,612
[SPEAKER_28]: Mr. President, the Lawrence Memorial Hospital has been an elephant in the room for quite some time now, and as we sit here and scratch our heads and ponder the future of that piece of land, I think it's important that this Council has an understanding as to whether or not there are any deeded restrictions on that parcel.

1649
02:22:48,192 --> 02:22:51,033
[SPEAKER_28]: There's much talk about zoning, much talk about development in the community,

1650
02:22:51,533 --> 02:22:56,137
[SPEAKER_28]: and if there are no deeded restrictions on that parcel, then we need to take a long, hard look at what's going on up in that area.

1651
02:22:56,457 --> 02:22:56,797
[SPEAKER_25]: Very good.

1652
02:22:57,317 --> 02:23:00,800
[SPEAKER_25]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco, all those in favor?

1653
02:23:01,080 --> 02:23:01,160
[SPEAKER_25]: Aye.

1654
02:23:01,601 --> 02:23:02,521
[SPEAKER_25]: Motion passes.

1655
02:23:03,042 --> 02:23:13,790
[SPEAKER_25]: Offered by Councilor Knight, being resolved that the Medford City Council wish the Medford Mustang football team best of luck on this Thursday, 130th Medford Malden Thanksgiving Day football game.

1656
02:23:14,610 --> 02:23:15,591
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Knight.

1657
02:23:15,611 --> 02:23:20,994
[SPEAKER_28]: Mr. President, I will spare my colleagues and those at home viewing of my rendition of the Mustang Fight Song.

1658
02:23:21,615 --> 02:23:28,660
[SPEAKER_28]: However, I'd like to wish the Medford Mustangs the best of luck on Thursday morning, and hopefully we can pull off a victory.

1659
02:23:29,200 --> 02:23:30,181
[SPEAKER_28]: So I wish them the best of luck.

1660
02:23:30,201 --> 02:23:31,121
[SPEAKER_28]: They've had a great season.

1661
02:23:31,141 --> 02:23:33,283
[SPEAKER_28]: They've made us proud, and this is the big one.

1662
02:23:34,223 --> 02:23:42,307
[SPEAKER_25]: And don't forget, on the day of the game, there'll be a dedication of, there'll be a couple of dedications there at halftime, so please make sure everybody gets out there.

[SPEAKER_25]: POW chair.

1664
02:23:43,668 --> 02:23:44,929
[SPEAKER_25]: Above the POW chair.

1665
02:23:45,369 --> 02:23:47,790
[SPEAKER_25]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco.

1666
02:23:47,830 --> 02:23:48,450
[SPEAKER_25]: All those in favor?

1667
02:23:48,631 --> 02:23:48,891
[SPEAKER_25]: Aye.

1668
02:23:49,071 --> 02:23:49,951
[SPEAKER_25]: Motion passes.

1669
02:23:50,211 --> 02:23:51,152
[SPEAKER_25]: Offered by Councilor Knight.

1670
02:23:52,112 --> 02:24:00,717
[SPEAKER_25]: Being resolved that the DPW commissioner report back to the council the status of paper 17666 relative to Wildwood Road.

1671
02:24:02,127 --> 02:24:02,788
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilman Knight.

1672
02:24:03,128 --> 02:24:04,489
[SPEAKER_28]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1673
02:24:04,789 --> 02:24:12,616
[SPEAKER_28]: Four weeks ago I put forward a paper asking that the engineering division investigate the concerns of the residents at 31 Wildwood Road.

1674
02:24:13,337 --> 02:24:18,842
[SPEAKER_28]: Back when the Winthrop Street draining project was done, they used the front of that home as a staging area.

1675
02:24:18,922 --> 02:24:26,048
[SPEAKER_28]: And what's happened is the road's sunken in, the nice strip of grass out front's sunken in, and it's creating a puddling and pooling situation out there.

1676
02:24:26,728 --> 02:24:29,931
[SPEAKER_28]: So we've asked the engineering division to investigate the matter and get back to us.

1677
02:24:29,971 --> 02:24:31,092
[SPEAKER_28]: We haven't had a response yet.

1678
02:24:31,192 --> 02:24:34,735
[SPEAKER_28]: It's an item that I'd like to see taken care of before the winter months begin.

1679
02:24:35,335 --> 02:24:40,720
[SPEAKER_28]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I'd like to reiterate my concern and ask the DPW Commission to report back what steps have been taken.

1680
02:24:41,502 --> 02:24:44,584
[SPEAKER_25]: The motion by Councilor Knights, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

1681
02:24:44,664 --> 02:24:45,265
[SPEAKER_25]: All those in favor?

1682
02:24:45,665 --> 02:24:45,765
[SPEAKER_25]: Aye.

1683
02:24:46,005 --> 02:24:46,926
[SPEAKER_25]: Motion passes.

1684
02:24:47,486 --> 02:24:48,627
[SPEAKER_25]: I have a note here from the clerk.

1685
02:24:49,988 --> 02:24:51,369
[SPEAKER_25]: This is a short week.

1686
02:24:51,729 --> 02:24:57,492
[SPEAKER_25]: Anything that anyone's gonna want to get on the agenda, please get it on by Wednesday for next week.

1687
02:24:57,572 --> 02:24:58,593
[SPEAKER_25]: Is that correct, Mr. Clerk?

1688
02:24:58,813 --> 02:24:59,694
[SPEAKER_25]: Two o'clock.

1689
02:24:59,714 --> 02:25:00,755
[SPEAKER_25]: Two o'clock on Wednesday.

1690
02:25:03,296 --> 02:25:03,897
[SPEAKER_25]: Which is tomorrow.

1691
02:25:03,917 --> 02:25:04,677
[SPEAKER_25]: City Hall.

1692
02:25:04,697 --> 02:25:04,957
[SPEAKER_25]: City Hall.

1693
02:25:05,438 --> 02:25:05,678
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

1694
02:25:08,277 --> 02:25:09,857
[SPEAKER_25]: The table records of the meetings.

1695
02:25:09,917 --> 02:25:12,398
[SPEAKER_20]: That's all I have.

1696
02:25:12,458 --> 02:25:13,479
[SPEAKER_24]: That's it.

1697
02:25:13,499 --> 02:25:13,779
[SPEAKER_24]: Where?

1698
02:25:37,106 --> 02:25:54,422
[SPEAKER_25]: Offered by Councilor Marks, be it resolved that the set of traffic lights at the corner of Forest Street and High Street increase the timing of the green light on Forest Street to assist with the cars cutting through the surrounding roads.

1699
02:25:55,628 --> 02:25:56,809
[SPEAKER_20]: Vice President Mox.

1700
02:25:57,429 --> 02:25:58,330
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1701
02:25:58,370 --> 02:26:07,136
[SPEAKER_20]: Residents on Oakland Street are extremely upset because Oakland, believe it or not, is being used as a cut-through from cars on Forest Street.

1702
02:26:07,997 --> 02:26:11,640
[SPEAKER_20]: And because of the timing of the lights,

1703
02:26:12,700 --> 02:26:28,604
[SPEAKER_20]: the Forest Street lights led by three or four cars at best, and the cars are starting to queue up all the way, so cars are trying to get around that light and ending up going down Oakland, which is creating chaos on that particular street.

1704
02:26:28,624 --> 02:26:39,067
[SPEAKER_20]: So I would ask that our head of lights, Mr. Randazzo, fix those lights on Forest Street to allow more cars

1705
02:26:39,887 --> 02:26:48,612
[SPEAKER_20]: to extend the green light to allow more cars coming down forest to access through the intersection of Medford Square.

1706
02:26:49,232 --> 02:26:57,357
[SPEAKER_28]: Mr. President, as a B paper, I'd like to propose that the Superintendent of Lights and Lines also provides us with a cost estimate as to what a study would cost.

1707
02:26:59,798 --> 02:27:05,802
[SPEAKER_28]: City of Medford and the Traffic Division and the Council pushing to reduce the speed limit from 30 to 25 miles an hour in the community.

1708
02:27:05,862 --> 02:27:11,526
[SPEAKER_28]: That does have an absolute effect on the timing of lights and the traffic patterns and the traffic flow in the community.

1709
02:27:11,566 --> 02:27:12,227
[SPEAKER_28]: That's why we did it.

1710
02:27:12,927 --> 02:27:22,313
[SPEAKER_28]: So we can reduce the speed limit in the community, but if we don't go and look at the timing of the lights across the community, I think we're missing a key component to the purpose of doing it.

1711
02:27:22,353 --> 02:27:28,658
[SPEAKER_28]: So I'd like to ask in the form of a B paper that the Superintendent of Lights and Lines provides us with a cost estimate as to what that study would cost.

1712
02:27:29,707 --> 02:27:34,768
[SPEAKER_25]: On the motion by Vice President Mark, as amended by Councilor Naye.

1713
02:27:35,748 --> 02:27:36,648

1714
02:27:36,828 --> 02:27:36,968

1717
02:27:46,070 --> 02:27:48,050
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Lungo-Koehnan, how did you find those records?

1718
02:27:49,970 --> 02:27:56,412
[SPEAKER_25]: On the motion by Councilor Lungo-Koehnan that we find the October 17th records in order, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

1722
02:28:05,754 --> 02:28:07,515
[SPEAKER_25]: Mr. Vice President, how did you find those records?

1723
02:28:07,535 --> 02:28:09,976
[SPEAKER_20]: I did not have a chance to review them, Mr. President, so I asked that they be tabled.

1724
02:28:11,457 --> 02:28:17,679
[SPEAKER_25]: On the motion by Vice President Mox that the October 31st meeting minutes be tabled for another week.

1725
02:28:18,279 --> 02:28:18,959
[SPEAKER_25]: All those in favor?

02:28:19,340 --> 02:28:19,440

[SPEAKER_25]: Meeting adjourned.

1739
02:29:44,808 --> 02:29:49,351
[SPEAKER_31]: if but when a woman steps onto that lunar surface.

1740
02:29:49,451 --> 02:29:52,654
[SPEAKER_31]: We are trying to work on being ready for that.

1741
02:29:52,954 --> 02:29:58,658
[SPEAKER_31]: I know you want to go back to the space station, but would you also like to go to the moon?

1742
02:29:58,998 --> 02:29:59,558
[SPEAKER_31]: Definitely.

1743
02:29:59,599 --> 02:30:01,340
[SPEAKER_31]: I mean, I would definitely pick the moon, right?

1744
02:30:01,360 --> 02:30:02,821
[SPEAKER_31]: You want to go where you haven't been yet.

1745
02:30:02,841 --> 02:30:04,222
[SPEAKER_07]: The future will be based on...

1746
02:37:34,164 --> 02:37:36,885
[SPEAKER_41]: as a proof that we have a major democracy in Poland.

1747
02:37:37,445 --> 02:37:41,507
[SPEAKER_41]: But the image which is trying to be built is that this is dictatorship.

1748
02:37:42,147 --> 02:37:43,988
[SPEAKER_41]: Millions elected law and justice.

1749
02:37:44,528 --> 02:37:44,889
[SPEAKER_41]: Millions.

1750
02:37:45,529 --> 02:37:46,489
[SPEAKER_41]: We are not North Korea.

1751
02:37:46,549 --> 02:37:47,610
[SPEAKER_41]: We are not Saudi Arabia.

1752
02:37:47,890 --> 02:37:50,151
[SPEAKER_41]: We are European, proud, beautiful country.

1753
02:37:51,022 --> 02:38:00,591
[SPEAKER_35]: It may be legal to demonstrate, but after the latest abortion protests, the very next day the offices of two women's groups were raided by police.

1754
02:38:01,612 --> 02:38:08,979
[SPEAKER_35]: The divisions in Polish society don't just apply to the country's future direction, they also apply to its past.

1755
02:38:09,679 --> 02:38:15,264
[SPEAKER_35]: I headed north to visit the recently opened Museum of the Second World War in Gdansk.

1756
02:38:17,575 --> 02:38:25,041
[SPEAKER_35]: This museum has been specially designed to give visitors a real sense of what Poland was like in the 1930s and 40s.

1757
02:38:25,601 --> 02:38:32,847
[SPEAKER_35]: So I'm standing in a room which has been mocked up to look like a typical Polish street just before the outbreak of the war.

1758
02:38:38,711 --> 02:38:46,435
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm now on another street at the end of the war though and you get a sense of the real devastation that Poland suffered.

1759
02:38:47,055 --> 02:38:56,380
[SPEAKER_35]: Over here we have piles of rubble, glass and wood and the walls of the buildings are pockmarked with artillery shells and bullets.

1760
02:38:58,161 --> 02:39:01,023
[SPEAKER_12]: Our museum was attacked from the very beginning.

1761
02:39:01,463 --> 02:39:02,744
[SPEAKER_12]: We were accused of

1762
02:46:31,860 --> 02:46:41,751
[SPEAKER_35]: was one which would have seen all judges on Poland's Supreme Court forced to resign and then only those favoured by the Justice Minister reappointed.

1763
02:46:42,612 --> 02:46:50,600
[SPEAKER_35]: At a hastily arranged press conference in Brussels, the Vice President of the EU Commission, Franz Timmermans, was in no doubt.

1764
02:46:51,081 --> 02:46:53,664
[SPEAKER_35]: It flew in the face of EU values.

1765
02:46:54,244 --> 02:46:58,207
[SPEAKER_22]: These laws considerably increase the systemic threat to the rule of law in Poland.

1766
02:46:58,667 --> 02:47:03,891
[SPEAKER_22]: Each individual law, if adopted, would seriously erode the independence of the Polish judiciary.

1767
02:47:04,392 --> 02:47:11,677
[SPEAKER_22]: Collectively, they would abolish any remaining judicial independence and put the judiciary under full political control.

1768
02:54:40,588 --> 02:54:59,043
[SPEAKER_00]: of estate built social housing this all boosts domestic consumption it boosts the domestic tourism industry many families have been able to to go on holiday with their children for the first time something they couldn't afford to do previously this money is is being recycled into the economy and at the same time is all of these sort of

1769
02:54:59,403 --> 02:55:02,344
[SPEAKER_00]: almost left-wing social and economic policies are taking place.

1770
02:55:02,665 --> 02:55:10,969
[SPEAKER_00]: Poland continues to post very impressive growth figures, foreign investment continues to flood in, so PiS has managed to pull off a trick.

1771
02:55:16,711 --> 02:55:20,373
[SPEAKER_35]: These policies have been successful not just in poorer rural...

1772
03:02:48,987 --> 03:02:49,887
[SPEAKER_36]: been achieved.

1773
03:02:50,627 --> 03:02:58,530
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Mnangagwa, seen by many as a new hope, has been a close ally of Mr. Mugabe for decades, with a reputation as a hardliner.

1774
03:02:59,050 --> 03:03:08,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Priscilla Misihirabwi-Mishonga, an MP for the opposition movement for democratic change, says she's concerned over the role of ZANU-PF in a future government.

1775
03:03:09,327 --> 03:03:29,541
[SPEAKER_29]: Some of us feel that those that are in ZANU-PF really need to do an introspection, because if they kept this man, even after he had done the kind of atrocities that he did, I worry whether they will be the kind of people who will turn a leaf and really deliver to the people of Zimbabwe a democratic country.

1776
03:03:29,981 --> 03:03:32,123
[SPEAKER_29]: That concerns me, and that worries me.

1777
03:03:32,949 --> 03:03:41,518
[SPEAKER_04]: The Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri has arrived back in Beirut after he shocked the country by announcing his resignation in Saudi Arabia two and a half weeks ago.

1778
03:03:42,239 --> 03:03:48,286
[SPEAKER_04]: His statement prompted a political crisis in Lebanon, and many believed he was being held against his will by the Saudis.

1779
03:03:48,766 --> 03:03:53,231
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not clear if he intends to withdraw his resignation or reaffirm it.

1780
03:03:54,172 --> 03:04:03,725
[SPEAKER_04]: The ride-hailing company Uber has admitted that hackers stole the personal data of 50 million of its customers and 7 million drivers more than a year ago.

1781
03:04:03,746 --> 03:04:09,053
[SPEAKER_04]: The new CEO said some personal details, email addresses and mobile phone numbers

1782
03:11:37,787 --> 03:11:40,329
[SPEAKER_34]: And during that 15 months, where are you?

1783
03:11:41,009 --> 03:11:45,512
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm in what's called Birderby Police Station, which is a temporary detention facility.

1784
03:11:45,932 --> 03:11:47,413
[SPEAKER_34]: Supposed to keep people there a couple of weeks, Matt.

1785
03:11:47,433 --> 03:11:48,094
[SPEAKER_34]: So they're cells?

1786
03:11:48,194 --> 03:11:49,395
[SPEAKER_34]: Yeah, a couple of weeks.

1787
03:11:49,755 --> 03:11:50,636
[SPEAKER_34]: I was there 15 months.

1788
03:11:51,096 --> 03:11:52,517
[SPEAKER_34]: During that 15 months, no investigation.

1789
03:11:53,017 --> 03:11:54,098
[SPEAKER_34]: There was no questioning of me.

1790
03:11:54,138 --> 03:11:58,621
[SPEAKER_34]: There was questioning on the first day, and then the morning after the first day, and then that was it.

1791
03:11:58,661 --> 03:12:00,463
[SPEAKER_34]: Nothing until 15 months later.

1792
03:12:00,483 --> 03:12:01,824
[SPEAKER_34]: So no questioning, no investigation.

1793
03:12:02,504 --> 03:12:10,450
[SPEAKER_34]: Rarely, I mean, any kind of resemblance that you would have of a normal system where if you're accused of something, you get the right to see your lawyer, translate, none of that.

1794
03:12:11,150 --> 03:12:13,032
[SPEAKER_34]: You never expect to have to go through something like this.

1795
03:12:13,072 --> 03:12:15,914
[SPEAKER_34]: So obviously, when it happened to me, my friends and my family contacted the British Embassy.

1796
03:12:16,254 --> 03:12:17,635
[SPEAKER_34]: They came, I think, after the second or

1797
03:19:46,450 --> 03:20:12,537
[SPEAKER_34]: I was being hit and I was being beaten and because you were gay because I was gay and I was sexually abused you know I had I won't go into too much detail but you know I had coca-cola bottles placed in places that you know they shouldn't be placed in in addition to that obviously because it became in the newspapers and the guards talked to the police and sorry the guards talked to the prisoners the prisoners began to know you know so I then had difficulties in the jail because again the majority of the people there were from

1798
03:20:13,057 --> 03:20:16,058
[SPEAKER_34]: the region, they were not expats, so that caused me great difficulties.

1799
03:20:16,078 --> 03:20:21,901
[SPEAKER_34]: What it also meant is that I couldn't have my partner obviously come and visit me, he's from the Middle East, but he couldn't come and visit me.

1800
03:20:22,521 --> 03:20:32,046
[SPEAKER_34]: And one of the things that then became very important for that for me is that I had asked the court in Dubai, can you not have my hearings in public that discussed my partner?

1801
03:20:32,506 --> 03:20:33,587
[SPEAKER_34]: because it puts us at risk.

1802
03:20:34,128 --> 03:20:39,674
[SPEAKER_34]: The English courts had granted us that, the Dubai court said no, and not only did they say no, they then put it on YouTube.

1803
03:28:15,110 --> 03:28:17,752
[SPEAKER_34]: So that gives you an idea of the level of pain that I was in.

1804
03:28:18,192 --> 03:28:36,383
[SPEAKER_06]: But the more stories like yours are told, not just here but perhaps more importantly in the UAE, in the Middle East more generally, the more they're disseminated on social media in a way that's much harder to control than conventional media, doesn't there come a point where it actually damages the country's interests and therefore it will be in their interest to change that?

1805
03:28:36,403 --> 03:28:37,264
[SPEAKER_34]: Yes, I think it does.

1806
03:28:37,584 --> 03:28:49,437
[SPEAKER_34]: And I think it's, you know, I think it's, you know, certainly when I came out and I set up the charity with a partner of mine, Radha Sterling, who had worked on cases like mine before, you know, like I said, we have a charity, Due Justice in Dubai.

1807
03:28:49,457 --> 03:28:57,125
[SPEAKER_34]: When we set that up, you know, one of the things that we want to do, as well as helping people there, is to raise the profile so we can say, you know, Dubai, you can change this.

1808
03:28:58,307 --> 03:29:01,991
[SPEAKER_34]: There is no reason to abuse and torture and have unfair trials.

1809
03:29:02,993 --> 03:29:07,479
[SPEAKER_34]: I mean it might benefit you in the short term in terms of your local businesses and your local families.

1810
03:29:07,939 --> 03:29:10,142
[SPEAKER_34]: So you're an optimist but you're still very angry?

1811
03:29:10,323 --> 03:29:14,949
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm very angry from my side but I'm an optimist and to be honest I would like to go there and help them change.

1812
03:36:43,625 --> 03:36:46,928
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we'd drop off into the deep ocean somewhere like the Grand Banks, for example.

1813
03:36:47,068 --> 03:36:51,052
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we'd go across some deep ocean there, where there's the wreck of the Titanic, of course, at 3,800 metres.

1814
03:36:59,712 --> 03:37:07,860
[SPEAKER_39]: The coastline of Newfoundland and Labrador weaves through fjords, bays and fishing villages that fringe the wild North Atlantic.

1815
03:37:08,680 --> 03:37:17,608
[SPEAKER_39]: During the first half of the 19th century, this was the promised land for immigrants from Ireland and Scotland fleeing economic hardship.

1816
03:37:17,909 --> 03:37:21,652
[SPEAKER_39]: They came to work on an ocean rich with cod and whales.

1817
03:37:24,078 --> 03:37:30,159
[SPEAKER_39]: Petty Harbour Maddox Cove is a fishing community whose very existence is shaped by the Atlantic.

1818
03:37:30,779 --> 03:37:35,060
[SPEAKER_39]: They used to say you could walk to shore on the backs of the plentiful cod.

1819
03:37:36,260 --> 03:37:38,081
[SPEAKER_39]: The whole town relied on fishing.

1820
03:37:38,961 --> 03:37:50,083
[SPEAKER_39]: But as the fisheries expanded and the abundance of fish attracted huge trawlers from other parts of the world, the Petty Harbour fishermen started to notice the cod were getting scarcer.

1821
03:37:51,083 --> 03:37:52,124
[SPEAKER_39]: Finally, in 1992, one of

1822
03:45:22,704 --> 03:45:25,385
[SPEAKER_11]: being much for me but now it's everything.

1823
03:45:26,466 --> 03:45:37,610
[SPEAKER_39]: Marine collagen is extracted from fish scales, dried and made into proteins and serums that are claimed to keep the body's joints and skin supple and to delay aging.

1824
03:45:38,170 --> 03:45:42,552
[SPEAKER_11]: This one is perch and woolfish and salmon.

1825
03:45:43,092 --> 03:45:48,836
[SPEAKER_39]: Hren is not the only one being creative with waste products from fish from the cold Icelandic waters.

1826
03:45:49,596 --> 03:45:55,800
[SPEAKER_39]: In the center of Reykjavik, we find a small gallery boasting beautiful accessories made from fish skin.

1827
03:45:56,561 --> 03:46:03,245
[SPEAKER_11]: And this one is caught and it's all tanned in Iceland, turned into leather.

1828
03:46:03,605 --> 03:46:08,368
[SPEAKER_11]: This is one factory in north of Iceland that makes the fish skin.

1829
03:46:09,489 --> 03:46:12,251
[SPEAKER_11]: I worked in a fish factory when I was

1830
03:53:40,955 --> 03:53:45,379
[SPEAKER_39]: tight system that saw fishing towns cleared under the spatial planning laws.

1831
03:53:47,140 --> 03:53:49,642
[SPEAKER_39]: Monieba Isaacs comes from a fishing family.

1832
03:53:50,183 --> 03:54:04,355
[SPEAKER_39]: For 20 years, her work as a researcher at the University of the Western Cape has been with marginalized coastal communities, especially women who try to earn a living catching local fish such as snook, rock lobster and abalone.

1833
03:54:11,419 --> 03:54:14,561
[SPEAKER_36]: And then the women dream of fishing permits, fishing rights.

1834
03:54:14,981 --> 03:54:17,862
[SPEAKER_36]: And the greatest dream of all is of an abalone farm.

1835
03:54:18,042 --> 03:54:22,824
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes, the women dream of their own community aquaculture business, an abalone farm.

1836
03:54:27,798 --> 03:54:42,507
[SPEAKER_32]: just about a kilometer away is Simonstown and that is where my family was forced removed in the late 1960s to an area called Ocean View.

1837
03:54:43,087 --> 03:54:47,890
[SPEAKER_32]: Grandfather was a fisherman and my grandmother was a fisherwoman.

1838
03:54:48,830 --> 03:54:56,795
[SPEAKER_32]: And also growing up in a fishing community, fishing area, the community and fishing has always been part of

1839
03:54:56,895 --> 03:54:58,680
[SPEAKER_32]: of my life and growing up.

1840
04:02:29,862 --> 04:02:30,763
[SPEAKER_04]: political future.

1841
04:02:31,343 --> 04:02:39,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Mnangagwe, seen by many as a new hope, has been a close ally of Mr. Mugabe for decades, with a reputation as a hardliner.

1842
04:02:39,948 --> 04:02:50,135
[SPEAKER_04]: Priscilla Misihirabwe Mushonga, an MP for the opposition Movement for Democratic Change party, says she's concerned over the role of ZANU-PF in a future government.

1843
04:02:50,787 --> 04:03:10,999
[SPEAKER_29]: Some of us feel that those that are in ZANU-PF really need to do an introspection, because if they kept this man, even after he had done the kind of atrocities that he did, I worry whether they will be the kind of people who will turn a leaf and really deliver to the people of Zimbabwe a democratic country.

1844
04:03:11,440 --> 04:03:13,581
[SPEAKER_29]: That concerns me, and that worries me.

1845
04:03:14,600 --> 04:03:23,303
[SPEAKER_04]: The Lebanese Prime Minister, Saad Hariri, has arrived back in Beirut after he shocked the country by announcing his resignation in Saudi Arabia two and a half weeks ago.

1846
04:03:23,984 --> 04:03:27,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Hariri's supporters celebrated in the streets.

1847
04:03:31,207 --> 04:03:36,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Saad Hariri is expected to make clear later if he intends to reaffirm his resignation.

1848
04:03:36,729 --> 04:03:39,550
[SPEAKER_04]: Many Lebanese believe Saudi Arabia pressured him

1849
04:11:08,208 --> 04:11:12,472
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't remember driving as fast as that day back to Santiago.

1850
04:11:12,932 --> 04:11:15,935
[SPEAKER_30]: And I remember going through these internal contradictions.

1851
04:11:15,955 --> 04:11:18,557
[SPEAKER_30]: On one hand, I thought that he had already been killed.

1852
04:11:19,178 --> 04:11:31,749
[SPEAKER_30]: Then, all of a sudden, you would sort of have this sense of hope and think, OK, no, he's still alive, and at the same time wish that if they are going to kill him, they better kill him soon so he doesn't suffer.

1853
04:11:33,070 --> 04:11:43,439
[SPEAKER_37]: In fact, it was 36 years before you had confirmation that your father was dead, when some fragments of bone that were found in a mine were found to be his.

1854
04:11:44,360 --> 04:11:48,223
[SPEAKER_37]: What was it like living for so long without information?

1855
04:19:16,887 --> 04:19:19,149
[SPEAKER_30]: deciding for me and my children's future.

1856
04:19:19,709 --> 04:19:23,092
[SPEAKER_30]: But I was determined to not let Pinochet defeat me.

1857
04:19:23,372 --> 04:19:24,553
[SPEAKER_30]: I was going to defeat him.

1858
04:19:26,194 --> 04:19:28,676
[SPEAKER_37]: What kind of justice did you get for your husband?

1859
04:19:32,179 --> 04:19:41,545
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm very aware that it was some sort of justice, probably not the ideal one, not everything that we were hoping to get, but it was also what was possible.

1860
04:19:41,725 --> 04:19:43,066
[SPEAKER_30]: We had to be realistic.

1861
04:19:43,566 --> 04:19:56,314
[SPEAKER_30]: You have to bear in mind that when the truth about his case came out, it was actually the first crime in which we were able to find out everything that happened from the moment when they were detained until they were executed.

1862
04:27:33,628 --> 04:27:37,311
[SPEAKER_40]: The past few years, he's been constantly on the move around the U.S.

1863
04:27:37,851 --> 04:27:41,314
[SPEAKER_40]: Usually he only stays in a city for a few weeks, but he likes L.A.

1864
04:27:41,934 --> 04:27:46,758
[SPEAKER_26]: I chose to stay this long this time because there was more to do, more people to talk to.

1865
04:27:47,118 --> 04:27:48,399
[SPEAKER_40]: You have a lot more music to play?

1866
04:27:49,020 --> 04:27:50,561
[SPEAKER_26]: I've got a lot of music up here.

1867
04:27:50,581 --> 04:27:55,966
[SPEAKER_26]: 25 years of it, so I've got to give it to somebody.

1868
04:27:57,301 --> 04:28:03,705
[SPEAKER_40]: On a good day, Shaver has made a hundred bucks in one sitting, but usually he makes enough to buy himself a meal.

1869
04:28:04,185 --> 04:28:05,806
[SPEAKER_40]: His favorite meal, breakfast.

1870
04:28:06,146 --> 04:28:09,548
[SPEAKER_26]: I usually make enough to get one solid meal, a couple of snacks.

1871
04:28:09,988 --> 04:28:13,290
[SPEAKER_40]: After playing at Union Station, we walk across the street to a diner.

1872
04:28:14,530 --> 04:28:16,291
[SPEAKER_26]: I'd like all you can eat pancakes, please.

1873
04:28:16,592 --> 04:28:18,352
[SPEAKER_40]: He likes to share whatever money he makes.

1874
04:28:18,453 --> 04:28:19,273
[SPEAKER_26]: What do you want Jerry?

1875
04:28:22,615 --> 04:28:25,236
[SPEAKER_40]: Today, he wants to treat his friend Jerry to breakfast.

1876
04:28:32,038 --> 04:28:35,680
[SPEAKER_40]: As he eats his pancakes, he tells me what it would be like if he had a home.

1877
04:28:36,160 --> 04:28:36,680
[SPEAKER_40]: He would cook.

1878
04:28:37,320 --> 04:28:38,301
[SPEAKER_40]: He would make origami.

1879
04:28:38,901 --> 04:28:39,901
[SPEAKER_40]: He likes to make roses.

1880
04:28:39,921 --> 04:28:41,922
[SPEAKER_26]: He could get permanent supportive housing.

1881
04:28:41,942 --> 04:28:42,983
[SPEAKER_26]: He says he's on six lists.

1882
04:28:49,526 --> 04:28:52,822
[SPEAKER_40]: But he always has one stipulation, a piano nearby.

1883
04:36:24,160 --> 04:36:31,990
[SPEAKER_38]: can't swallow, so therefore they had to put a cuff inside the throat to stop saliva going down into his lungs.

1884
04:36:32,791 --> 04:36:38,799
[SPEAKER_38]: They'd given him this tracheotomy, he was on this machine, because we get a very high fever, so they'd had to cover him in ice.

1885
04:36:39,500 --> 04:36:40,621
[SPEAKER_38]: So no, it wasn't very jolly.

1886
04:36:41,897 --> 04:36:47,539
[SPEAKER_37]: Robin was paralyzed from the neck down and unable to breathe without a mechanical pump.

1887
04:36:48,219 --> 04:36:49,720
[SPEAKER_37]: He wasn't able to speak for a while.

1888
04:36:50,200 --> 04:36:54,481
[SPEAKER_37]: Diana gave birth to their son without him there and remembers introducing them.

1889
04:36:55,362 --> 04:36:59,903
[SPEAKER_38]: Well, I took him in to see Robin and, you know, didn't get much.

1890
04:37:00,504 --> 04:37:02,664
[SPEAKER_38]: Not surprising, not much reaction really.

1891
04:37:03,685 --> 04:37:04,325
[SPEAKER_38]: Not surprising.

1892
04:37:05,445 --> 04:37:06,847
[SPEAKER_38]: He was still really very ill.

1893
04:37:07,428 --> 04:37:12,674
[SPEAKER_38]: He was totally paralyzed and didn't really know what was going on and you know all that sort of thing.

1894
04:37:13,495 --> 04:37:18,281
[SPEAKER_37]: The family flew back to England from Kenya and Robin was moved into a new hospital.

1895
04:37:18,701 --> 04:37:20,624
[SPEAKER_37]: It looked like he might never leave.

1896
04:37:21,204 --> 04:37:24,108
[SPEAKER_38]: I think probably the depression set in afterwards when he

1897
04:44:52,789 --> 04:45:00,617
[SPEAKER_16]: with three bedrooms with sort of intensive care standard care for severely disabled people to go on holiday.

1898
04:45:08,283 --> 04:45:11,444
[SPEAKER_37]: When he reached his 60s, Robin's health worsened.

1899
04:45:11,864 --> 04:45:13,864
[SPEAKER_37]: Jonathan remembers when he first realized.

1900
04:45:13,884 --> 04:45:18,725
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, it was really when he started having terrible bleeds and he was weakening.

1901
04:45:19,625 --> 04:45:31,448
[SPEAKER_16]: Simply the effect of being in a wheelchair and unable to move all those years, the wear and tear on his body, but also on the inside of him as well, was very, very considerable.

1902
04:45:32,408 --> 04:45:44,513
[SPEAKER_16]: And he definitely got, he got weaker and at a certain point the quality of life that my mother and he had built up and enjoyed over all those years was no longer there.

1903
04:45:47,995 --> 04:45:54,798
[SPEAKER_37]: Robin Cavendish died at home on the 8th of August 1994 having spent over three decades breathing through

1904
04:46:00,538 --> 04:46:05,721
[SPEAKER_37]: In Jonathan's film about his father, Robin is played by the Hollywood star Andrew Garfield.

1905
04:46:06,021 --> 04:46:07,702
