00:06:48,459 --> 00:06:49,960
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

2
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:50,380
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:51,520
[SPEAKER_16]: Am I on?

4
00:06:51,821 --> 00:06:52,161
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, cool.

5
00:06:52,181 --> 00:06:53,361
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

6
00:06:53,421 --> 00:07:00,705
[SPEAKER_16]: Everybody ready?

7
00:07:03,206 --> 00:07:03,746
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

00:07:34,061 --> 00:07:43,409
[SPEAKER_16]: The action discussion item for this meeting is once again 24 dash 033 zoning ordinance updates with the Ennis associates team.

19
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:44,971
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you so much for being here.

20
00:07:45,051 --> 00:07:46,732
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, City staff for being here.

21
00:07:46,812 --> 00:07:48,934
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you to members of the public for joining us.

22
00:07:50,795 --> 00:07:57,598
[SPEAKER_16]: This is, I believe, the 16th, the agenda says, the 16th Zoning Updates Project Meeting with Innes Associates.

23
00:07:57,658 --> 00:08:03,540
[SPEAKER_16]: This week we are again talking about the Salem Street Corridor Zoning Proposal discussion.

24
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:06,821
[SPEAKER_16]: We touched on this topic last week, last Tuesday as well.

25
00:08:06,881 --> 00:08:09,462
[SPEAKER_16]: Really glad to be talking about this with you all again.

26
00:08:09,482 --> 00:08:16,385
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm just going to briefly reintroduce this specific topic and then I'll hand it over to

27
00:08:18,026 --> 00:08:25,112
[SPEAKER_16]: and we'll have a presentation by Ennis Associates and commentary by city staff, and then we'll proceed with our discussion.

28
00:08:26,533 --> 00:08:36,762
[SPEAKER_16]: But just to quickly reintroduce what we're talking about today, this is our second time having a full meeting devoted to the Salem Street Corridor District.

29
00:08:37,243 --> 00:08:42,688
[SPEAKER_16]: This is just one part of the City Council's systemic review and update of citywide zoning over the course of this term.

30
00:08:43,628 --> 00:08:51,875
[SPEAKER_16]: We've been working with Ennis Associates, thank you for being here, which also assisted the city on the years-long comprehensive plan process.

31
00:08:53,337 --> 00:09:08,530
[SPEAKER_16]: So this corridor proposal, like other aspects of the zoning project, have been crafted by Ennis in consultation with, oh, thank you for letting me know.

32
00:09:11,454 --> 00:09:26,115
[SPEAKER_16]: So these zoning proposals crafted by the zoning consultant in consultation with this committee and city staff, all of these are guided by citywide goals and community feedback as articulated in the comprehensive plan, the housing production plan, the climate action and adaptation plan.

33
00:09:26,936 --> 00:09:31,138
[SPEAKER_16]: and the community input and feedback that we're very fortunate to have throughout this process.

34
00:09:32,558 --> 00:09:50,864
[SPEAKER_16]: And just because I take every opportunity to say this, after these proposals leave this committee, they go back to the city council, they then are procedurally must be referred to the community development board for their review and recommendations, and then come back to the city council once again, before those votes to ordain are taken.

35
00:09:51,584 --> 00:09:56,086
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a complicated process, so I like to repeat it as often as possible, because I know it took me a while to internalize it.

36
00:09:57,581 --> 00:10:06,765
[SPEAKER_16]: So like I said, the initial draft of the Salem Street corridor zoning proposal was presented to this committee on December 3rd for some initial feedback, questions and comments.

37
00:10:07,585 --> 00:10:19,130
[SPEAKER_16]: The project proposes new zoning for the corridor along Salem Street, which includes the roughly two to four parcels extending north and south of Salem Street, beginning at the Route 60 roundabout and extending up to Haines Square.

38
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:26,933
[SPEAKER_16]: So this proposal does not include the greater Salem Street neighborhood outside of those boundaries, though of course it does touch them and is adjacent to them.

39
00:10:28,971 --> 00:10:31,833
[SPEAKER_16]: for getting further into the weeds than that.

40
00:10:32,053 --> 00:10:49,806
[SPEAKER_16]: I will pass it off to Ennis Associates for a presentation, which I understand we saw a really similar presentation to this last week, but I think you're going to highlight some of the tweaks and changes that have been incorporated since last week based on feedback that we got from the community as well as feedback from councilors and city staff.

41
00:10:50,426 --> 00:10:54,089
[SPEAKER_16]: Before I turn it over, any initial comments or questions from councilors?

42
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:57,431
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, great.

43
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:11,122
[SPEAKER_06]: Madam chair, um, Alicia Hunt, director of planning, development and sustainability.

44
00:11:11,302 --> 00:11:24,449
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to share for the public for the viewing public that the presentation that Paula is going to give and the draft zoning that is being talked about tonight is now on the city's website.

45
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:34,655
[SPEAKER_06]: If somebody was to go to medfordma.org slash zoning and scroll down to phase two and drop that down and scroll down to tonight's date,

46
00:11:35,599 --> 00:11:44,903
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to follow along at home more easily, then what's on the screen through the Zoom, you can go to see those yourself and then you can refer back to them and review them.

47
00:11:45,223 --> 00:11:49,865
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want people to know before we started that they were available on site as of five minutes ago.

48
00:11:51,566 --> 00:11:52,286
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Director Hunt.

49
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:56,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Madam Chair, if I may.

50
00:11:57,202 --> 00:12:00,644
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you and good afternoon.

51
00:12:02,105 --> 00:12:03,385
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here with the team.

52
00:12:03,986 --> 00:12:05,527
[SPEAKER_03]: We are from Innes Associates.

53
00:12:05,687 --> 00:12:07,508
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Paula Ramos-Martinez.

54
00:12:07,548 --> 00:12:11,770
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the senior planner and designer from Innes Associates.

55
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,831
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to my right, Emily Innes.

56
00:12:14,071 --> 00:12:21,395
[SPEAKER_03]: She's the director of Innes Associates and Jimmy Rocha, who is the data analyst in Innes Associates.

57
00:12:22,815 --> 00:12:27,396
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to share now the presentation that I have for you today.

58
00:12:30,277 --> 00:12:32,497
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I share?

59
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:33,937
[SPEAKER_03]: I will send the request.

60
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:46,260
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

61
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:03,499
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to first start with the agenda.

62
00:13:03,539 --> 00:13:05,640
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to talk about the process timeline.

63
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:16,666
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we're going to talk about the just simplified plan for 2025 that we already introduced on last meeting.

64
00:13:18,004 --> 00:13:23,446
[SPEAKER_03]: I will do a small introduction why we are talking about Salem Street right now as a corridor.

65
00:13:23,986 --> 00:13:25,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Where does that come from?

66
00:13:25,146 --> 00:13:33,789
[SPEAKER_03]: We will talk about the current zoning that you have and then the proposed zoning that we are bringing today.

67
00:13:35,469 --> 00:13:41,031
[SPEAKER_03]: Then Emily will go will continue to explain more the draft in detail.

68
00:13:43,412 --> 00:13:51,135
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we started from July, we presented a workshop to the city Councilors and the city staff.

69
00:13:52,776 --> 00:14:00,022
[SPEAKER_03]: with a lot of analysis, non-conforming maps, and getting all the suggestions and visions that they had.

70
00:14:01,724 --> 00:14:10,851
[SPEAKER_03]: In August, we brought pre-designed and drafts of the zoning maps for Mystic Avenue and for Salem Street.

71
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:12,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the two corridors that we are

72
00:14:13,834 --> 00:14:14,655
[SPEAKER_03]: studying at the moment.

73
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:22,363
[SPEAKER_03]: In December 3, the last meeting that we had, we presented the corridor, the Salem Street.

74
00:14:23,465 --> 00:14:33,656
[SPEAKER_03]: So this will be a continuation from that and with all the comments that were presented on that meeting and how we have adjusted some of those.

75
00:14:34,516 --> 00:14:35,217
[SPEAKER_03]: we're going to be looking at.

76
00:14:35,237 --> 00:14:36,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Um this.

77
00:14:36,157 --> 00:14:37,217
[SPEAKER_03]: I will go very quickly.

78
00:14:37,237 --> 00:14:39,678
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the plan 2025 that we have.

79
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:48,142
[SPEAKER_03]: So how we are going to geographically continue to study and do the analysis and the, um, update of the zoning.

80
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:55,625
[SPEAKER_03]: We will start January with North Medford, so we will study in the district's single family one and two.

81
00:14:56,146 --> 00:14:57,606
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we will work on the

82
00:15:03,909 --> 00:15:05,110
[SPEAKER_03]: we will talk about the neighborhood notes.

83
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:07,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Um then on February will, uh, work on South Medford.

84
00:15:07,691 --> 00:15:08,451
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a part.

85
00:15:08,631 --> 00:15:13,294
[SPEAKER_03]: The districts will be apartment one apartment to and general residential.

86
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:15,495
[SPEAKER_03]: Topics the same as before.

87
00:15:15,675 --> 00:15:17,856
[SPEAKER_03]: We will also talk about the neighborhood notes.

88
00:15:18,776 --> 00:15:22,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Um then in in March, we will talk about the Medford Square.

89
00:15:22,758 --> 00:15:25,300
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, mainly commercial one.

90
00:15:32,543 --> 00:15:39,730
[SPEAKER_03]: We will add more topics that we do have at the moment, but this is just an outline, so more things will come.

91
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:47,817
[SPEAKER_03]: And then in April, it will be West Medford, Commercial One's district, and in May, Wellington Glenwood area.

92
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:55,845
[SPEAKER_03]: We will talk about Office One, Two, Industrial, and Mass districts, and we will study the dimensional standards and development.

93
00:15:56,505 --> 00:16:06,982
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is just an outline, we will continue to be more in depth of dates and the topics that we will discuss in each of these months.

94
00:16:09,598 --> 00:16:13,282
[SPEAKER_03]: So our introduction is why we are talking about Salem Street.

95
00:16:13,783 --> 00:16:18,968
[SPEAKER_03]: This comes from the Medford comprehensive plan that was released in January 2023.

96
00:16:19,289 --> 00:16:27,918
[SPEAKER_03]: This was a plan that was made within two years of constant participation from the communities.

97
00:16:29,019 --> 00:16:37,261
[SPEAKER_03]: and they did this complex result of all those studies that were made at that time.

98
00:16:37,761 --> 00:16:50,005
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are just, our work, our job right now is to take those, the suggestion strategies from the comprehensive plan, from climate adaptation, action adaptation plan,

99
00:16:50,585 --> 00:16:58,528
[SPEAKER_03]: and all the, from city staff and city councilors recommendations, and we are doing an upgrade of the zoning.

100
00:16:59,609 --> 00:17:02,170
[SPEAKER_03]: So at the moment, we're studying the corridors.

101
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:04,511
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see it in this big image.

102
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:09,313
[SPEAKER_03]: All these purple lines are considered corridors.

103
00:17:09,773 --> 00:17:12,314
[SPEAKER_03]: This means that they have specific characteristics.

104
00:17:12,894 --> 00:17:19,497
[SPEAKER_03]: So they connect places, like for example, Salem Street connects Medford Square with Felsway,

105
00:17:20,237 --> 00:17:25,161
[SPEAKER_03]: area and they have commercial and active ground floor.

106
00:17:25,781 --> 00:17:32,246
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are the characteristics that set these areas and these streets to be corridors.

107
00:17:32,907 --> 00:17:38,291
[SPEAKER_03]: So from this comprehensive plan, for example, we have one of these strategies.

108
00:17:38,651 --> 00:17:46,938
[SPEAKER_03]: We zone to allow mixed use in village centers as of right in smaller nodes outside the traditional commercial squares such as Salem Street.

109
00:17:47,398 --> 00:17:50,301
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is where we are coming from.

110
00:17:50,761 --> 00:18:00,110
[SPEAKER_03]: We did Mystic Avenue, and that is a transformational rezoning that we are doing.

111
00:18:00,731 --> 00:18:02,753
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's also citywide.

112
00:18:03,113 --> 00:18:09,399
[SPEAKER_03]: So Mystic Avenue and Salem Street are very different in scale, and also who's serving.

113
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:20,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Salem Street, it's mainly serving the neighborhoods around it, the residential neighborhoods that are north and south of Salem Street.

114
00:18:20,726 --> 00:18:26,649
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the density and the changes that we see from Mystic to Salem are considerably different.

115
00:18:28,348 --> 00:18:38,671
[SPEAKER_03]: So the current zoning in Medford, what we are looking at is in this area that is marked in this black circle.

116
00:18:40,192 --> 00:18:46,714
[SPEAKER_03]: If we do the zoom on that area, what we see is that we have two districts.

117
00:18:47,194 --> 00:18:49,935
[SPEAKER_03]: One is the apartment that is in the southern part.

118
00:18:50,695 --> 00:18:52,116
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's all this area.

119
00:18:52,896 --> 00:18:59,745
[SPEAKER_03]: and then the northern part of Salem Street near Felsway, that is commercial one.

120
00:19:00,686 --> 00:19:09,037
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we want to do is explain in here in this chart, in this table, what you can see is

121
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:14,455
[SPEAKER_03]: all the dimensional requirements for these districts.

122
00:19:14,656 --> 00:19:21,427
[SPEAKER_03]: So Medford, what it does is apply dimensional standards per district, but also by use.

123
00:19:21,968 --> 00:19:24,993
[SPEAKER_03]: So if the use is different, the dimensional standards are different.

124
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:36,598
[SPEAKER_03]: But what I wanted to mention is just to keep in mind that your current zoning, which is different from what you have right now there, from what it is constructed, what it exists there.

125
00:19:37,758 --> 00:19:44,643
[SPEAKER_03]: In your zoning, the minimum lot size to construct is 5,000 for single family, 5,000 square foot lots.

126
00:19:47,225 --> 00:19:49,567
[SPEAKER_03]: For a single family, 6,000 for two family.

127
00:19:49,947 --> 00:19:52,689
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we have attached that I will explain later what that means.

128
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:55,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Multi-family is 10,000.

129
00:19:56,151 --> 00:20:00,594
[SPEAKER_03]: And then any other principal structure is 10,000.

130
00:20:00,935 --> 00:20:03,336
[SPEAKER_03]: Just so that we keep in mind.

131
00:20:03,737 --> 00:20:07,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Apartment one does not allow commercial on your ground floor.

132
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:10,962
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is also interesting to retail or commercial in the ground floor.

133
00:20:11,822 --> 00:20:12,463
[SPEAKER_03]: to keep in mind.

134
00:20:12,903 --> 00:20:20,550
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the maximum that you could build is four stories high in apartment one.

135
00:20:20,991 --> 00:20:23,273
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is depending on the use, it's usually three.

136
00:20:24,654 --> 00:20:29,639
[SPEAKER_03]: But for example, for assisted living, there is four stories high.

137
00:20:30,419 --> 00:20:39,526
[SPEAKER_03]: And then in commercial one, what you have is the minimum lot is 10,000 for multifamily and for assisted living.

138
00:20:39,986 --> 00:20:46,731
[SPEAKER_03]: Then for hotel and other principal instructors and can be commercial, there is no minimum size.

139
00:20:47,331 --> 00:20:51,294
[SPEAKER_03]: There are not minimum area, but there are minimum frontage.

140
00:20:51,655 --> 00:20:54,997
[SPEAKER_03]: And for example, for the hotel minimum width and depth.

141
00:20:56,637 --> 00:21:07,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, the heights in commercial one is six and in hotel is 15 stories high.

142
00:21:07,789 --> 00:21:10,672
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is something that can happen right now by right.

143
00:21:11,272 --> 00:21:12,093
[SPEAKER_03]: in those areas.

144
00:21:12,133 --> 00:21:16,116
[SPEAKER_03]: So more in-depth, here you can see it with the diagrams.

145
00:21:17,157 --> 00:21:24,203
[SPEAKER_03]: We are talking about this area, the apartment one, and what you can construct.

146
00:21:24,223 --> 00:21:35,992
[SPEAKER_03]: So single family, 5,000 square feet, maximum height two and a half stories, single family attached, minimum lot area is 3,500, it's twice because it's in one end and the other, and the middle

147
00:21:37,233 --> 00:21:39,894
[SPEAKER_03]: a single family dwelling is 2,500.

148
00:21:40,015 --> 00:21:45,117
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a bit complicated, so if we want, I can explain that more.

149
00:21:45,417 --> 00:21:47,178
[SPEAKER_03]: And the maximum height is three stories.

150
00:21:47,718 --> 00:21:50,319
[SPEAKER_03]: And the multiple dwelling is a minimum of 10,000.

151
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:55,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, just be aware, this area, it's very historical.

152
00:21:56,362 --> 00:22:00,524
[SPEAKER_03]: So the parcels that you have in there, the lots that we have there, are not very big.

153
00:22:01,184 --> 00:22:07,566
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of this, more than 5,000 and especially 10,000, they will be non-conforming.

154
00:22:07,647 --> 00:22:13,889
[SPEAKER_03]: So you wouldn't really be able to construct according this minimum areas.

155
00:22:15,786 --> 00:22:27,750
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, if we go to the commercial, so this is the northern part, what you can construct is this multiple dwelling, is six stories high, and the minimum lot area is 10,000.

156
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:37,152
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, other principal structures, as I said, this doesn't have a minimum area, it has only minimum frontage, and then the maximum is four stories.

157
00:22:37,772 --> 00:22:39,553
[SPEAKER_03]: This can be, for example, a commercial building.

158
00:22:40,956 --> 00:22:47,440
[SPEAKER_03]: and then the hotel that has a minimum frontage of 50 and then 15 stories high.

159
00:22:47,861 --> 00:22:54,225
[SPEAKER_03]: That can happen in any of the northern area of Salem Street that is commercial one.

160
00:22:57,068 --> 00:23:07,632
[SPEAKER_03]: So what are we proposing is not looking at the code alone, the zoning code, but looking also at what it exists there.

161
00:23:07,992 --> 00:23:10,993
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the real character of Salem Street?

162
00:23:11,233 --> 00:23:12,554
[SPEAKER_03]: What is its identity?

163
00:23:13,214 --> 00:23:18,176
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we divided in this four sub-districts.

164
00:23:19,448 --> 00:23:26,092
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have mixed-use one, mixed-use two, commercial, and multi-unit residential.

165
00:23:26,792 --> 00:23:34,057
[SPEAKER_03]: What we wanted is mainly on Salem Street, we're going to find mixed-use, well, let me rephrase this.

166
00:23:34,497 --> 00:23:38,339
[SPEAKER_03]: So mixed-use two, which is the red lots,

167
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:48,186
[SPEAKER_03]: What are indicating is the areas that have better connection to the active areas in the neighborhood.

168
00:23:48,526 --> 00:23:57,412
[SPEAKER_03]: So they will serve those active areas, like, for example, Piki Park, or these are better connections.

169
00:23:57,452 --> 00:23:59,253
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a school in Park Street.

170
00:23:59,753 --> 00:24:08,700
[SPEAKER_03]: So these kind of intersections where we see that can be a lot more active, these nodes are going to be a bit more densified than the rest.

171
00:24:10,681 --> 00:24:18,426
[SPEAKER_03]: And that happened as well towards Felsway West, where we also have bigger lots and bigger opportunities.

172
00:24:19,707 --> 00:24:37,238
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is, for example, one of the changes that we made is that the lots of the target and the MBTA storage area lot are being changed from commercial to mixed use too, so that residential can also happen in this area.

173
00:24:40,141 --> 00:24:44,325
[SPEAKER_03]: We have just one little, for at the moment, one small commercial.

174
00:24:44,725 --> 00:24:48,148
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a gas station, which we think that can happen there.

175
00:24:48,508 --> 00:24:53,913
[SPEAKER_03]: So in order to maintain that use, we are considering commercial.

176
00:24:57,415 --> 00:25:00,517
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the difference between mixed-use one, mixed-use two?

177
00:25:01,197 --> 00:25:10,982
[SPEAKER_03]: These are lots, mixed-use one are lots that have a mix already with residential and commercial.

178
00:25:11,522 --> 00:25:16,565
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if the lots have already that mix, we kept them as mixed-use.

179
00:25:17,285 --> 00:25:22,687
[SPEAKER_03]: When one block was only residential, then we kept it as residential.

180
00:25:22,907 --> 00:25:36,071
[SPEAKER_03]: So we didn't introduce more mixed use in the area, we just kept it because we thought that it will reaffirm the identity that it has now, which is a lot of mix between commercial in the ground floor and residential.

181
00:25:37,271 --> 00:25:59,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Um I will explain now the uh standards but only before that um you see a lot of the between the Salem street lots and the neighborhoods we have what we call the transitional part or transitional lots and these are multi-unit residential and the idea is so that the heights and

182
00:26:00,412 --> 00:26:08,428
[SPEAKER_03]: the youth would transitionally, gradiently will convert into those single family districts.

183
00:26:11,095 --> 00:26:31,422
[SPEAKER_03]: So just to have a little bit clear of what are the minimum lot areas that we are proposing for these districts and the heights, I just want to mention that we have a difference between what the maximum height is as a base height, so what you can do.

184
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:35,403
[SPEAKER_03]: and when we include incentive zoning.

185
00:26:36,004 --> 00:26:50,850
[SPEAKER_03]: And incentive zoning is that we give an exchange, we negotiate to increase the density, so increase the height, if they give back something to community, and we will talk about that later.

186
00:26:51,271 --> 00:26:58,294
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you see this incentive zoning height, it's only if the developer is willing to give back something to the community.

187
00:26:59,485 --> 00:27:05,990
[SPEAKER_03]: So the multi-unit residential minimum lot area is 3,000 square feet and maximum height three stories.

188
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:15,717
[SPEAKER_03]: Mixed use, the minimum lot area is 3,000 square feet and maximum height three stories plus one with incentive zoning.

189
00:27:15,897 --> 00:27:21,001
[SPEAKER_03]: So it can be four and it's by right, but they have to do something for the community.

190
00:27:21,901 --> 00:27:36,258
[SPEAKER_03]: And this extra step, extra story has to have a step back so it doesn't feel too much too high on the street level.

191
00:27:38,128 --> 00:27:38,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Mixed use.

192
00:27:38,808 --> 00:27:41,309
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the denser part.

193
00:27:41,349 --> 00:27:42,809
[SPEAKER_03]: These are these nodes.

194
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:46,110
[SPEAKER_03]: The minimum lot area is 3,000 as well.

195
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:51,391
[SPEAKER_03]: Maximum height is four stories plus two with incentive zoning.

196
00:27:51,551 --> 00:27:53,232
[SPEAKER_03]: These two also have a step back.

197
00:27:53,712 --> 00:27:56,853
[SPEAKER_03]: And then commercial, the minimum lot area is 10,000 square feet.

198
00:27:57,393 --> 00:28:01,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Maximum height is three stories plus three with incentive zoning.

199
00:28:01,814 --> 00:28:05,055
[SPEAKER_03]: And from the fourth floor, two are a step back.

200
00:28:08,672 --> 00:28:14,538
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just want to remember that these lots are not very big.

201
00:28:14,878 --> 00:28:16,480
[SPEAKER_03]: They do not have a lot of depth.

202
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:28,932
[SPEAKER_03]: So just to keep in mind that the height that we are giving is the one that we really think is the best to densify, but also to not mess with the character of the area.

203
00:28:30,635 --> 00:28:43,926
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we review what you have right now and with your current zoning, what you're going to see in these images is what wouldn't be allowed today by right in your zoning.

204
00:28:44,427 --> 00:28:50,512
[SPEAKER_03]: So whenever we have in the first part of Salem Street commercial, it wouldn't be allowed.

205
00:28:50,912 --> 00:28:53,815
[SPEAKER_03]: So this one story high with commercial is not allowed.

206
00:28:56,656 --> 00:28:57,817
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not currently allowed.

207
00:28:57,877 --> 00:29:01,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's not currently with your current zoning allowed.

208
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:02,841
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to change that.

209
00:29:04,643 --> 00:29:07,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Then the multifamily, this is allowed.

210
00:29:07,506 --> 00:29:10,168
[SPEAKER_03]: That's okay.

211
00:29:10,708 --> 00:29:20,437
[SPEAKER_03]: And then on the lower picture where the residential is allowed, the commercial building next to it, it's not currently allowed.

212
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:25,361
[SPEAKER_03]: Same in the left corner.

213
00:29:27,402 --> 00:29:31,904
[SPEAKER_03]: The commercial area is not allowed in this beautiful historical building.

214
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:36,406
[SPEAKER_03]: The ground floor is commercial, so it wouldn't be allowed in the current zoning.

215
00:29:37,127 --> 00:29:38,488
[SPEAKER_03]: Gas stations are not allowed.

216
00:29:38,628 --> 00:29:44,251
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something that we also encourage because you have four gas stations in Salem Street.

217
00:29:46,794 --> 00:29:56,268
[SPEAKER_03]: Then again, every time that we see a commercial ground floor is not allowed, gas station, gas station, the residential, it is allowed.

218
00:29:56,449 --> 00:29:58,332
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the one that we also want to keep.

219
00:29:58,792 --> 00:29:59,974
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are not changing that.

220
00:30:01,135 --> 00:30:10,022
[SPEAKER_03]: commercial not allowed, residential yes it's allowed and we will keep as well in zoning, residential again is allowed and we will keep it.

221
00:30:10,982 --> 00:30:23,011
[SPEAKER_03]: These are the two on the right are this block residential character that I was talking about that we decided to keep in the proposed zoning.

222
00:30:23,997 --> 00:30:32,824
[SPEAKER_03]: And then on the left, on the inferior corner, on the lower corner, there is a house with a store front that wouldn't be allowed.

223
00:30:34,265 --> 00:30:39,709
[SPEAKER_03]: If we go to the commercial, because lots of things are permitted in commercial one, everything is allowed.

224
00:30:40,189 --> 00:30:43,672
[SPEAKER_03]: So here is some of the pictures that we wanted to show.

225
00:30:44,833 --> 00:30:51,898
[SPEAKER_03]: What we are proposing is to have the ground floor commercial and to add a residential on top of it.

226
00:30:55,501 --> 00:30:59,364
[SPEAKER_03]: Now the, these are all allowed.

227
00:30:59,564 --> 00:31:05,268
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the target box building that we will talk about it later.

228
00:31:05,608 --> 00:31:10,291
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the, in the lower part of the right, this is the Sunoco gas station.

229
00:31:10,611 --> 00:31:13,273
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the one that we will keep because it's in Fells Way.

230
00:31:14,274 --> 00:31:15,775
[SPEAKER_03]: We think it has good connection.

231
00:31:15,795 --> 00:31:17,936
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't enter really to Salem Street.

232
00:31:18,256 --> 00:31:22,439
[SPEAKER_03]: So we think it's a very good location for a gas station and it will serve the neighborhood as well.

233
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:25,181
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why we kept that commercial in it.

234
00:31:25,901 --> 00:31:35,044
[SPEAKER_03]: and then this is the what you have allowed in this area is an apartment of six stories, but that it has no step back.

235
00:31:35,144 --> 00:31:39,726
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't look into the street.

236
00:31:39,746 --> 00:31:41,066
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't activate the street.

237
00:31:41,467 --> 00:31:43,707
[SPEAKER_03]: So we want to we have some standards.

238
00:31:43,807 --> 00:31:47,809
[SPEAKER_03]: They mentioned development standards to make it a bit more

239
00:31:50,191 --> 00:32:03,705
[SPEAKER_03]: coherent with what we have at the moment, so that's why we do these step backs, but also that that ground floor gets a lot of activity and it makes this street more vibrant and safe.

240
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:13,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, one of the things that we are adding that we didn't, uh, showed last time is this new definition of business incubator.

241
00:32:13,949 --> 00:32:19,193
[SPEAKER_03]: This is something that city staff also thinks that can be very beneficial for the city.

242
00:32:19,994 --> 00:32:22,495
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and so we are bringing that

243
00:32:24,216 --> 00:32:33,301
[SPEAKER_03]: definition so that we can also include it in our use table and so that this zoning will have this use permitted.

244
00:32:33,321 --> 00:32:36,203
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just going to read it fast.

245
00:32:36,963 --> 00:32:46,668
[SPEAKER_03]: An organization that assists early innovators achieve a minimum viable product or service and create an achievable plan to take that product or service to market.

246
00:32:47,228 --> 00:33:01,301
[SPEAKER_03]: In addition to mentorship and investment opportunities, a business incubator gives access to logistical and technical resources, as well as shared office space, an incubator program can last for several months to a few years.

247
00:33:03,123 --> 00:33:06,526
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's one of the additions that we're doing.

248
00:33:07,962 --> 00:33:26,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Then on development and standards, because we heard some concerns about how this bigger development or bigger, higher density nodes that we are creating, how could that transit into the single family neighborhoods.

249
00:33:27,969 --> 00:33:32,611
[SPEAKER_03]: We are bringing this development standards that is called neighborhood compatibility.

250
00:33:33,412 --> 00:33:42,415
[SPEAKER_03]: And that says when an MX 1, 2 and commercial lot abuts a residential parcel, it shall be subject to context standards.

251
00:33:43,056 --> 00:33:49,879
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is that we will take the maximum height that is on the setback line.

252
00:33:51,099 --> 00:33:52,820
[SPEAKER_03]: on the side or rear line of the lot.

253
00:33:54,721 --> 00:34:05,727
[SPEAKER_03]: So if the residential has a maximum of three stories, that is your maximum that you're going to start in your side or rear lot line.

254
00:34:06,507 --> 00:34:15,592
[SPEAKER_03]: And then from there, you can gradually grow and go higher at a 45 degrees angle.

255
00:34:16,072 --> 00:34:17,252
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is if I have

256
00:34:18,613 --> 00:34:28,859
[SPEAKER_03]: I can go one story higher if I go, for example, 10 foot to the side, and then I can increase 10 foot on height.

257
00:34:29,319 --> 00:34:36,763
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's how increasingly could give height to our new development.

258
00:34:37,143 --> 00:34:45,648
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, that there is a transition so you don't have a six story building next to your single family house.

259
00:34:46,929 --> 00:34:48,790
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is for side and rear setbacks.

260
00:34:50,152 --> 00:34:59,901
[SPEAKER_03]: As well that in these dimensional extenders, we do not have the side setbacks and rear setbacks are zero sometimes.

261
00:35:00,221 --> 00:35:06,548
[SPEAKER_03]: So whenever it's zero, if you are about residential lot, your setback side or rear is going to be 10.

262
00:35:07,589 --> 00:35:09,751
[SPEAKER_03]: So we also increase the side setbacks.

263
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:14,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, then just to, um, give up.

264
00:35:15,173 --> 00:35:21,278
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to talk about parking and we will and there will be deeper study that we need to do.

265
00:35:21,898 --> 00:35:24,961
[SPEAKER_03]: These lots, as I said many times are not very big.

266
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:33,107
[SPEAKER_03]: So the requirements of parking that exist at the moment, uh, these Lots are not able to, um

267
00:35:36,101 --> 00:35:49,279
[SPEAKER_03]: They do not have that space, we will need to do more deep studies, but at the moment, it doesn't seem that there is enough space with your current zoning, it doesn't matter that is the new one or the older one.

268
00:35:51,081 --> 00:36:08,034
[SPEAKER_03]: We just wanted to show first the development standards that we have on the draft is that the buildings to be on the sidewalk, so on the front lot line, and the parking to be located on the back of the lots.

269
00:36:09,716 --> 00:36:26,490
[SPEAKER_03]: That can also be a cover parking as we see in the second one and the ground floor frontage can have a depth of 30 feet for example and then you can have your parking from it.

270
00:36:29,051 --> 00:36:34,035
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, the residential building, multifamily building that is already in Salem Street does something like this.

271
00:36:35,696 --> 00:36:45,002
[SPEAKER_03]: And then for the bigger, bigger lots, we would encourage to have buildings on the front, parking on the interior.

272
00:36:46,003 --> 00:36:49,645
[SPEAKER_03]: So as you can see in the last image.

273
00:36:51,166 --> 00:37:06,394
[SPEAKER_03]: We will also introduce, because of this issue of parking in Salem Street, we want to introduce a new incentive zoning that is when they make available public parking, they can have a density bonus.

274
00:37:07,174 --> 00:37:09,615
[SPEAKER_03]: So we need to continue to study this further.

275
00:37:09,995 --> 00:37:21,541
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is the idea that we bring so that a lot of the stress that will be put in this small lots are not are taken by the bigger, bigger lots that can provide public parking.

276
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:32,494
[SPEAKER_03]: So the changes that are done to the previous draft, so the ones that you saw and the ones that you will see in the draft are the zoning map.

277
00:37:32,514 --> 00:37:40,537
[SPEAKER_03]: So we did that change from commercial, these two lots on the northern part of Salem Street, from commercial to mixed use too.

278
00:37:41,697 --> 00:37:42,898
[SPEAKER_03]: Table of Use Regulation.

279
00:37:43,558 --> 00:37:52,002
[SPEAKER_03]: We have co-living by right in multi-unit residential district and in mixed use one district.

280
00:37:52,623 --> 00:37:56,625
[SPEAKER_03]: Adult use is not permitted in commercial use in Salem Street.

281
00:37:57,105 --> 00:37:59,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Parking in K-2 and J-9 have been

282
00:38:02,969 --> 00:38:12,959
[SPEAKER_03]: detailed in this table of use, and we include incubator business as a use if it's something that you think we should include today.

283
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:19,205
[SPEAKER_03]: Table of dimension requirements, active ground floor, we change it to active frontage.

284
00:38:20,466 --> 00:38:25,030
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a bit of misunderstanding, so we think active frontage is better.

285
00:38:25,971 --> 00:38:45,419
[SPEAKER_03]: uh word for it and then we did some changes on the step back it's not all of them from the third floor but only in multi-residential is from the sorry from mixes one is on um above the third floor and then mixes two and commercial is above the fourth floor when we did this step back

286
00:38:46,819 --> 00:38:51,561
[SPEAKER_03]: we brought the new definition of business incubator dimensional requirements and waivers.

287
00:38:52,442 --> 00:39:01,925
[SPEAKER_03]: We introduced the we just amend this ground floor active frontage so that it's it corresponds with the dimensional requirements.

288
00:39:02,546 --> 00:39:04,786
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the table of development incentive bonuses.

289
00:39:05,147 --> 00:39:10,409
[SPEAKER_03]: We add the public parking to incentive to community amenities privately maintained.

290
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:17,717
[SPEAKER_03]: And now I will give the word to Emily Innes.

291
00:39:21,775 --> 00:39:25,658
[SPEAKER_15]: So while Paola is switching us over, I will just say that that was a lot.

292
00:39:26,859 --> 00:39:44,133
[SPEAKER_15]: I am not going to go through the text word for word, but I am going to show you and the people here in this room and the people who are watching at home where to find the changes that we've just discussed so that as people review it, they'll have an idea of what to see.

293
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:48,957
[SPEAKER_15]: So if you can switch over to the Word document, Paola, that'd be great.

294
00:39:49,697 --> 00:40:06,889
[SPEAKER_15]: I do want to reinforce, because I think some people who might be tuning in for the first time may wonder, they may have heard that Mystic Avenue is being addressed as a corridor, that Salem Street is also being addressed as a corridor and kind of wondering what the differences are.

295
00:40:06,969 --> 00:40:15,935
[SPEAKER_15]: So I want to stress this idea that Paola mentioned earlier, that Mystic Avenue is viewed as transformational.

296
00:40:15,975 --> 00:40:19,217
[SPEAKER_15]: This comes directly out of the comprehensive plan.

297
00:40:19,837 --> 00:40:28,204
[SPEAKER_15]: it comes out of discussions that were done even before the comprehensive plan process began, and also in conversations with the city.

298
00:40:28,325 --> 00:40:39,614
[SPEAKER_15]: I think when we look at Salem Street, it is a corridor, it is connecting two different places, but it also has the potential to be the heart of an existing neighborhood.

299
00:40:39,754 --> 00:40:46,000
[SPEAKER_15]: And as Paola noted, we did a lot of work to understand what's on the ground now,

300
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:51,404
[SPEAKER_15]: how zoning does and does not encourage what's on the ground now.

301
00:40:51,465 --> 00:41:00,072
[SPEAKER_15]: The fact that there are so many commercial businesses in the apartment district where that district doesn't allow commercial makes those all non-conforming uses.

302
00:41:00,793 --> 00:41:01,794
[SPEAKER_15]: That's problematic.

303
00:41:01,894 --> 00:41:09,340
[SPEAKER_15]: The dimensional standard studies that we as a team did show the number of non-conformities that also makes it problematic.

304
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:13,184
[SPEAKER_15]: So a lot of our goals with Salem Street is

305
00:41:13,844 --> 00:41:22,549
[SPEAKER_15]: kind of right sizing the zoning and some places and enhancing it and others so I just do want to stress that that's been our goal and looking at it.

306
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:25,831
[SPEAKER_15]: When we look at the zoning itself.

307
00:41:26,372 --> 00:41:33,616
[SPEAKER_15]: You'll see that we have done some of the things that you've already seen for the mystic Avenue quarter.

308
00:41:34,317 --> 00:41:41,281
[SPEAKER_15]: We've added some new things and then we've changed some things because of Salem street is very definitely not mystic Avenue and I do want to stress that.

309
00:41:41,821 --> 00:41:56,271
[SPEAKER_15]: So as we go through it, the boilerplate you have a section in your zoning where you identify all what all what all the districts are, and that is up there now so we're adding this new Salem Street quarter district.

310
00:41:57,392 --> 00:42:02,896
[SPEAKER_15]: We are also going to make modifications to the table of use regulations and I know we have

311
00:42:03,516 --> 00:42:12,440
[SPEAKER_15]: talked before about the fact that when we finish all of this work we are going to be coming back and putting together all of the pieces that are separate now.

312
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,161
[SPEAKER_15]: So you'll see this again.

313
00:42:14,181 --> 00:42:18,362
[SPEAKER_15]: This also starts the color coding that you'll see in the draft.

314
00:42:18,502 --> 00:42:31,788
[SPEAKER_15]: So we have this yellow highlight that indicates that something is new in the Salem Street Corridor District that is not found in Mystic Avenue and that's this idea of the multi-unit residential.

315
00:42:32,949 --> 00:42:45,684
[SPEAKER_15]: That's being added to the table of use regulation so you see that yellow coming through, you will note as we move through that a lot that there are no commercial uses allowed in the multi unit residential.

316
00:42:46,184 --> 00:42:51,671
[SPEAKER_15]: You also see this bright turquoise highlighting coming through and that's where we have.

317
00:42:52,271 --> 00:42:55,435
[SPEAKER_15]: The districts of MX one the MX to the commercial.

318
00:42:55,475 --> 00:43:10,915
[SPEAKER_15]: These are also districts that are found in mystic Avenue, they have some strong similarities, but in the Salem Street quarter if you see a turquoise it means we've changed it from mystic Avenue so this is something that is different from mystic Avenue.

319
00:43:11,455 --> 00:43:31,737
[SPEAKER_15]: And in that case what we've done is we have removed some of the commercial and particularly the industrial uses that might be appropriate for mystic but absolutely are not appropriate for Salem Street and that's a recognition of both the use itself, but also the scale of that use that mystic Avenue is a very different area.

320
00:43:33,439 --> 00:43:42,625
[SPEAKER_15]: compared to Salem Street so really with Salem Street what we're trying to do is allow those things that reinforce the neighborhood characteristic.

321
00:43:43,365 --> 00:43:44,706
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'll just scroll through this.

322
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:54,093
[SPEAKER_15]: But you can see particularly as we get to motor vehicle related uses, and the industrial uses that those are now missing from this area.

323
00:43:54,773 --> 00:44:01,898
[SPEAKER_15]: There's also some purple things about parking that's just a reminder to us to have another look at that when we swing back around to this area.

324
00:44:03,299 --> 00:44:23,437
[SPEAKER_15]: So then we are adding in the dimensional standards and again you can see that although we have a mixed one a mixed two and a commercial in in mystic Avenue, the lot areas the other height maximums that palace already described are different they are scaled down to be appropriate to Salem Street.

325
00:44:23,957 --> 00:44:29,739
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, we've added the mixed, mixed multi unit residential in here.

326
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:34,681
[SPEAKER_15]: And you can see we've changed those setbacks and requirements to be appropriate.

327
00:44:35,121 --> 00:44:43,685
[SPEAKER_15]: We've added, we're adding a definition to active frontage for active frontage and we have added the business incubated definition in there.

328
00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:49,152
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's the general changes to other parts of the zoning ordinance.

329
00:44:49,212 --> 00:45:04,101
[SPEAKER_15]: When we get into the Salem Street Corridor District itself, you will see that the format is very similar to the format of the Mystic Avenue Corridor, but the purposes, the applicability, those components are different.

330
00:45:04,161 --> 00:45:08,764
[SPEAKER_15]: So again, you see that the yellow text, this is a new component.

331
00:45:09,204 --> 00:45:13,227
[SPEAKER_15]: We've changed the sidewalk size that is required for front setbacks.

332
00:45:13,687 --> 00:45:21,473
[SPEAKER_15]: We're changing the frontage to be more appropriate to what's going on in Salem Street that may flow backwards to Mystic Avenue.

333
00:45:23,134 --> 00:45:34,242
[SPEAKER_15]: We have some height waivers that we've added, but again, these are either not applying to certain things like chimneys ventilators towers this is consistent to what you have.

334
00:45:35,002 --> 00:45:37,485
[SPEAKER_15]: or it requires a special permit.

335
00:45:37,545 --> 00:45:42,550
[SPEAKER_15]: This allows for something that doesn't meet the minimum height requirement to be waived.

336
00:45:42,650 --> 00:45:44,051
[SPEAKER_15]: So that is a change.

337
00:45:44,672 --> 00:45:47,274
[SPEAKER_15]: I do want to spend some time on the incentives.

338
00:45:47,354 --> 00:45:54,021
[SPEAKER_15]: Paola mentioned the idea that somebody could apply for a higher height in exchange for a public benefit.

339
00:45:54,621 --> 00:46:00,162
[SPEAKER_15]: We have defined a number of incentives you will have seen some of these for mystic Avenue as well.

340
00:46:01,163 --> 00:46:22,388
[SPEAKER_15]: We've worked reworked a little bit, how they apply but deeper affordability, which means rather than 80% of area median income being able to provide units at 65% of area median income or more affordable units are options for a developer and the city to consider.

341
00:46:23,228 --> 00:46:26,470
[SPEAKER_15]: We have community amenities that are privately maintained.

342
00:46:26,570 --> 00:46:40,659
[SPEAKER_15]: Paola mentioned that we're adding public parking to that list, but we also have outdoor spaces, indoor public spaces, and we are looking into low-income shared community solar, which is something that the City Council asked us.

343
00:46:40,699 --> 00:46:49,744
[SPEAKER_15]: So the public parking and the community solar are still to be confirmed because we are doing research on how to do that, but we wanted to introduce the idea.

344
00:46:51,085 --> 00:47:07,351
[SPEAKER_15]: Community and so any of those amenities would be provided by the developer and maintained by the developer or the later owner community amenities that are publicly maintained are paid for by the development entity but maintained by the city and that would be streetscape improvements.

345
00:47:08,011 --> 00:47:22,988
[SPEAKER_15]: When we think of streetscape improvements, what we're thinking of are primarily trees and street trees to provide shade and air quality improvements or street furniture such as benches, trash receptacles, etc.

346
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:28,554
[SPEAKER_15]: Here we are not talking about reconfiguring the street itself.

347
00:47:30,795 --> 00:47:37,158
[SPEAKER_15]: Concealed parking ground floor rents for local businesses or nonprofits.

348
00:47:38,138 --> 00:47:44,540
[SPEAKER_15]: The green score zero emission or certifiable as lead platinum or equivalent or things that you've seen before.

349
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:59,686
[SPEAKER_15]: We have significant the ability to add design guidelines which is something that we're continuing to discuss with the city and the applicability of development standards to this, and the development standards are primarily similar to mystic Avenue.

350
00:48:00,467 --> 00:48:07,270
[SPEAKER_15]: But again, you will see some changes the sidewalk width, in particular that are more appropriate for Salem Street.

351
00:48:08,450 --> 00:48:25,240
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want to skim through the design guidelines I or the development standards I will say that all of the development standards would apply, either at the special permit level, or to as are bright requiring site plan review so there is a point at which the public can comment on both of these.

352
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:30,703
[SPEAKER_15]: And then finally the affordable affordability requirements there is no change from your existing.

353
00:48:31,463 --> 00:48:43,369
[SPEAKER_15]: So with that, I'm going to stop we will stop our share we are certainly happy to answer any questions, but we appreciate the chance to again show this with the amendments to yourselves and the community.

354
00:48:44,990 --> 00:48:48,131
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you so much for the presentation, Paola and Emily really appreciate it.

355
00:48:50,575 --> 00:48:53,958
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll echo what you said this is a lot to take in zoning always is.

356
00:48:53,978 --> 00:49:11,296
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that's one of our challenges here is this is a zoning is never not going to be technical complicated veering into wonky and confusing so I appreciate you doing your very best to break it down for Councilors members of the public, whether we're seeing it for the third time.

357
00:49:12,621 --> 00:49:15,623
[SPEAKER_16]: like councillors are for the first time as some members of the public, maybe.

358
00:49:15,743 --> 00:49:16,204
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much.

359
00:49:17,905 --> 00:49:18,786
[SPEAKER_16]: Lots to delve into here.

360
00:49:18,826 --> 00:49:21,689
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll go first to any comments or questions from my fellow councillors.

361
00:49:26,233 --> 00:49:27,234
[SPEAKER_16]: And Councilor Leming.

362
00:49:30,317 --> 00:49:30,617
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead.

363
00:49:32,038 --> 00:49:32,278
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

364
00:49:32,398 --> 00:49:38,344
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you going back to the timeline in the beginning and thinking about parking, is there

365
00:49:39,208 --> 00:49:44,550
[SPEAKER_08]: Is transportation going to be included as a discussion topic in itself?

366
00:49:44,610 --> 00:49:46,330
[SPEAKER_08]: And if so, what month is that planned for?

367
00:49:50,451 --> 00:49:53,752
[SPEAKER_16]: Want to speak to the citywide parking strategy we're thinking about?

368
00:49:53,772 --> 00:50:00,594
[SPEAKER_03]: Go for it.

369
00:50:02,075 --> 00:50:05,659
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it's I said before, it was just the outline.

370
00:50:05,999 --> 00:50:09,243
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to include all these topics like, for example, the TDM.

371
00:50:10,444 --> 00:50:13,067
[SPEAKER_03]: So we will embarking as well.

372
00:50:13,467 --> 00:50:17,391
[SPEAKER_03]: So we will bring that up when I have a bit also more information.

373
00:50:21,241 --> 00:50:38,198
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so at the end, what we want is to have these, when we have all of the districts together and to analyze better when we have all the data, we will do

374
00:50:41,687 --> 00:50:47,292
[SPEAKER_03]: We will review these broader topics like for example parking, but when we have all of them.

375
00:50:48,013 --> 00:50:49,455
[SPEAKER_03]: So around March, but you can.

376
00:50:49,495 --> 00:50:49,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

377
00:50:50,415 --> 00:50:51,196
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

378
00:50:51,456 --> 00:50:51,957
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

379
00:50:51,977 --> 00:50:56,301
[SPEAKER_15]: I think where we were going with that is that.

380
00:50:57,442 --> 00:51:04,966
[SPEAKER_15]: Our next steps are north and south Medford which are primarily residential and the transportation demand management and some of the other parts are less applicable.

381
00:51:05,487 --> 00:51:15,172
[SPEAKER_15]: We wanted to get into the squares first so I think when we hit Medford square which I believe is March on the schedule that's about the time that we would be talking about that.

382
00:51:16,212 --> 00:51:21,076
[SPEAKER_15]: rather than the lower density residential areas, but we have not forgotten about it.

383
00:51:22,477 --> 00:51:42,553
[SPEAKER_15]: We are finding as we are working with the as we talked about in the spring when we got to the geography and started applying some of the principles that we talked about at a high level and sort of April, May and June, we would start to see how those principles would flesh out I think we've learned a lot from the applicability to the quarters.

384
00:51:42,973 --> 00:51:53,295
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd like to apply the parking ideas and the transportation ideas to the squares, and that Medford Square, which is in March, thank you, Paola, for bringing that up, would be a good time to do that.

385
00:51:55,915 --> 00:52:08,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Just an addition, the next meeting, planning committee meeting, we will bring a more in-depth so that all those topics that you're talking about will be in there.

386
00:52:13,727 --> 00:52:15,068
[SPEAKER_16]: Did you have a follow-up to that, Councilor Lohmann?

387
00:52:17,008 --> 00:52:24,350
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I was just going to confirm.

388
00:52:24,370 --> 00:52:24,470
Great.

389
00:52:24,530 --> 00:52:24,790
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

390
00:52:24,810 --> 00:52:25,970
[SPEAKER_16]: Or President Beres, I'll go to you.

391
00:52:28,011 --> 00:52:29,231
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

392
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:39,114
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I think just to the goal of the outline as presented today was to identify when certain areas of the city

393
00:52:40,345 --> 00:52:41,426
[SPEAKER_12]: we'll see map changes.

394
00:52:42,326 --> 00:52:46,429
[SPEAKER_12]: And then additionally, within those months, we'll also be looking at some of those other things.

395
00:52:46,449 --> 00:53:03,321
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think TDM, basically I'm repeating what everyone else said, but there are topics that are going to be brought up over those five months that aren't included in that outline right now, because we felt like the priority was to try to let people know when the committee would be looking at map changes in different parts of the city.

396
00:53:03,341 --> 00:53:06,523
[SPEAKER_16]: Great.

397
00:53:07,344 --> 00:53:07,664
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

398
00:53:08,464 --> 00:53:09,405
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Scarpelli, go ahead.

399
00:53:11,993 --> 00:53:12,894
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

400
00:53:13,854 --> 00:53:27,241
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate all the hard work and a lot of the questions that I really have is really based on just the information that I'm getting from residents and there are some that are very easy for me to

401
00:53:28,041 --> 00:53:35,590
[SPEAKER_09]: uh explained to to eliminate some fear and and and and rumors that were going around and I appreciate that.

402
00:53:36,091 --> 00:53:44,561
[SPEAKER_09]: I was wondering if if our friends from Ennis can just have you ever been given a request because a resident asked and I said I I would reach out

403
00:53:45,502 --> 00:54:05,811
[SPEAKER_09]: uh for for city councilors and for uh people that have been educated when it talks about zoning and it's it's easy to follow but have have you ever been requested from a community that you've worked with to try to maybe simplify some of these definitions and maybe a bullet point

404
00:54:06,491 --> 00:54:33,952
[SPEAKER_09]: type of report where where this meeting when they we talk about parking and understanding the offsets when it you know the biggest fear i'm here i give you a good example is the situation that we're dealing with and with tufts university and a 10-story building and how it affects residential homes and it's it's it's clearly defined in this process when we see the the

405
00:54:35,433 --> 00:54:51,982
[SPEAKER_09]: the changes that we're looking at and how the residential area, we won't see those types of drastic changes where some residents are fearful for.

406
00:54:52,062 --> 00:55:01,387
[SPEAKER_09]: So have you ever been requested, and this would be my request, that after a report is given like we've put together tonight, very thorough, but

407
00:55:03,669 --> 00:55:20,758
[SPEAKER_09]: to without embarrassing or disrespecting anyone, have you ever been asked to put together a bullet point that really simplifies what was discussed today so just the average person can read and understand the basic points that

408
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:36,428
[SPEAKER_09]: We have gone through because I, I think this is where it's overwhelming and this is where people I know council beers and council vice president and our director have put together an extensive plan to make sure that we're reaching our communities.

409
00:55:36,488 --> 00:55:39,810
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that I've been standing on my soapbox and really saying.

410
00:55:40,410 --> 00:55:53,898
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, bringing our meetings to the neighborhoods where people can ask these simplified questions, because I think a lot of people that have reached out to me are a little intimidated by the language and this format, which I believe we can all agree to that.

411
00:55:54,519 --> 00:55:57,321
[SPEAKER_09]: So, again, if there's any way that we can do.

412
00:55:58,942 --> 00:56:10,909
[SPEAKER_09]: some sort of a format that can be simplified so people can understand what the major changes are and what the processes are, I think would be super helpful if you can help with that.

413
00:56:11,849 --> 00:56:12,230
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

414
00:56:14,631 --> 00:56:15,772
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

415
00:56:15,792 --> 00:56:16,572
[SPEAKER_16]: I appreciate that.

416
00:56:16,772 --> 00:56:21,875
[SPEAKER_16]: And before I turn it over to Ines to respond, it looks like there is a response percolating.

417
00:56:23,036 --> 00:56:25,438
[SPEAKER_16]: Just before this meeting,

418
00:56:26,772 --> 00:56:31,395
[SPEAKER_16]: began, we were talking about more ways that we can continue to expand the use of diagrams.

419
00:56:31,435 --> 00:56:40,160
[SPEAKER_16]: And I know this isn't exactly what you're proposing, but kind of that ongoing theme of what else can we include apart from just the text to convey what we're talking about?

420
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:51,526
[SPEAKER_16]: Because even as one councillor who talks about this as much as anybody else behind the rail, it still takes a lot of effort to understand what we're talking about and break it down and paraphrase it in ways that people can understand.

421
00:56:51,566 --> 00:56:52,827
[SPEAKER_16]: I certainly sympathize with that.

422
00:56:53,607 --> 00:56:54,427
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for bringing it up.

423
00:56:54,527 --> 00:57:09,494
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think the diagrams have been super helpful that because that's one thing that is really simplified that I hate to say it, but to show people pictures with what the changes will be made it very simple to explain to some people.

424
00:57:09,534 --> 00:57:12,355
[SPEAKER_09]: But I appreciate that council vice president.

425
00:57:13,550 --> 00:57:14,090
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, thank you.

426
00:57:14,110 --> 00:57:33,722
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that that's something that I want us to continue to explore, and that if that's something that council leadership can help support NS Associates on, because I know you're doing the lion's share of the work in putting together the complicated proposal, which is legally required, maybe that's something that we can work on to have a more layman-friendly version to accompany these documents when they do come before the council.

427
00:57:33,742 --> 00:57:35,904
[SPEAKER_16]: That's something we'll certainly continue to talk about.

428
00:57:36,524 --> 00:57:41,567
[SPEAKER_16]: I know Councilor Leming had a comment, unless there's a direct response from NS or city staff on that.

429
00:57:44,062 --> 00:57:46,898
[SPEAKER_16]: No pressure, I just... Councilor Lohmann, go ahead.

430
00:57:52,498 --> 00:58:15,345
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I would like to point out this doesn't solve the issue of quite informing residents before things happen, but a good deal of effort is put into summarizing these meetings in the City Council newsletter in about as high level terms as possible, which I typically do include links to these

431
00:58:15,965 --> 00:58:20,068
[SPEAKER_08]: plans in the planning and permitting descriptions of what happens.

432
00:58:20,128 --> 00:58:37,080
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's not a perfect solution to all of the concerns that were brought up by my colleague, but that is one mechanism where we're trying to really simplify what is happening in this committee as it happens.

433
00:58:39,862 --> 00:58:40,682
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Leming.

434
00:58:40,762 --> 00:58:41,623
[SPEAKER_16]: And yeah, I think that's a

435
00:58:43,919 --> 00:58:48,388
[SPEAKER_16]: Breaking it down, making it simpler is something that we'll continue to try to improve out over the course of this project.

436
00:58:49,129 --> 00:58:50,332
[SPEAKER_16]: If you had something to add there.

437
00:58:53,869 --> 00:58:54,630
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, thank you.

438
00:58:54,670 --> 00:58:58,353
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanted to add that we are, two things actually.

439
00:58:58,513 --> 00:59:05,099
[SPEAKER_15]: One is that we are continuing to look at how we can be more visual about explaining some of these.

440
00:59:05,159 --> 00:59:16,048
[SPEAKER_15]: The good news with that is that many of the diagrams that we can have created and continue to create as we move forward could actually be incorporated into your zoning.

441
00:59:16,969 --> 00:59:26,276
[SPEAKER_15]: in the final stage so that these concepts are available to, you know, in visual form, not just now, but to anybody working with the zoning in the future.

442
00:59:26,456 --> 00:59:34,743
[SPEAKER_15]: So, and the other thing is we would be happy to assist with trying to break it down into more of a summary.

443
00:59:36,484 --> 00:59:36,564
[SPEAKER_15]: that.

444
00:59:36,584 --> 00:59:45,787
[SPEAKER_15]: Zoning can sometimes be difficult to do that, because if you lose too much, you may actually give the impression of something that's that becomes legally incorrect.

445
00:59:45,927 --> 00:59:47,708
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's kind of fine tuning it.

446
00:59:47,788 --> 00:59:56,710
[SPEAKER_15]: But the more that we can help the community understand to be aware of, you know if we can support the council and doing that, we're happy to talk about.

447
00:59:57,291 --> 00:59:57,531
[SPEAKER_15]: Further

448
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:02,652
[SPEAKER_16]: great.

449
01:00:03,092 --> 01:00:03,652
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you so much.

450
01:00:03,692 --> 01:00:05,633
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that that could be a thank you.

451
01:00:06,013 --> 01:00:06,633
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for that.

452
01:00:08,213 --> 01:00:08,413
[SPEAKER_16]: Great.

453
01:00:08,573 --> 01:00:09,433
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilors Scarpelli.

454
01:00:10,234 --> 01:00:16,015
[SPEAKER_16]: Are there any other questions or comments from Councilors on the Salem Street corridor proposal at this time?

455
01:00:19,155 --> 01:00:19,455
[SPEAKER_16]: Myself.

456
01:00:19,495 --> 01:00:20,935
[SPEAKER_16]: I was really happy to see, um.

457
01:00:21,836 --> 01:00:24,996
[SPEAKER_16]: Some of the themes that were brought up last week and another conversations

458
01:00:30,851 --> 01:00:38,897
[SPEAKER_16]: what's the term, the context standards for when we do have those transitions from a mixed use or commercial building to a residential right next to it.

459
01:00:38,917 --> 01:00:50,825
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that's a really smart way of making sure that we don't see those really sharp height differences, even if it's only, in a lot of cases, gonna be the difference of a story or two.

460
01:00:51,366 --> 01:00:56,490
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that makes a lot of sense to airspace protection from shade.

461
01:00:58,271 --> 01:01:04,395
[SPEAKER_16]: And I know that there are, I was happy to see also some of the additions to the incentive zoning.

462
01:01:04,836 --> 01:01:20,347
[SPEAKER_16]: I think the theme here is we want to make sure that we are strongly incentivizing developers to add these things to our communities that we know we want there, while at the same time making sure that we're getting a lot out of it when they are taking advantage of those opportunities for extra heights.

463
01:01:20,748 --> 01:01:34,291
[SPEAKER_16]: And I know that there are more potential things that we're looking to add into incentive zoning that aren't a part of this draft that we're going to continue to consider and maybe add into incentive zoning, either for specific districts or citywide, but that need more discussion and meetings to think about.

464
01:01:35,231 --> 01:01:36,852
[SPEAKER_16]: So thanks for your diligence on that as well.

465
01:01:38,932 --> 01:01:44,933
[SPEAKER_16]: Seeing no further comments or questions from councilors, we can, any comments or questions from city staff at this time?

466
01:01:47,274 --> 01:01:47,414
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

467
01:01:52,850 --> 01:01:56,551
[SPEAKER_16]: Go ahead, Director Hunt.

468
01:01:56,931 --> 01:02:12,575
[SPEAKER_06]: Madam Chair, I just wanted to just flag one little thing that we found between the two zonings so that we can ask them to change it and in the final version that comes out is that the marijuana ones have to be special permit from the ZBA.

469
01:02:12,936 --> 01:02:17,557
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's actually a change for the Mystic Ab is coming back through because our ordinance says

470
01:02:18,277 --> 01:02:28,869
[SPEAKER_06]: That the zoning board is the decider on is the special permit granting authority so we can't try to change it in the table without changing it in the

471
01:02:30,090 --> 01:02:31,571
[SPEAKER_06]: enabling ordinance as well.

472
01:02:31,991 --> 01:02:37,413
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's one of the recommendations that the Community Development Board is recommending on the MSTGAV, just to keep us in compliance.

473
01:02:37,493 --> 01:02:39,154
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just spotted it on this table.

474
01:02:39,694 --> 01:02:42,575
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll just change it to be in compliance.

475
01:02:43,015 --> 01:02:48,157
[SPEAKER_06]: If the board would like to change that to not have it be the ZBA, we should look at the ordinance and not just the zoning table.

476
01:02:49,378 --> 01:02:50,458
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, got it.

477
01:02:50,478 --> 01:02:51,358
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for flagging that.

478
01:02:52,359 --> 01:02:57,701
[SPEAKER_16]: And we'll go to President Beres and then we'll go to

479
01:03:06,745 --> 01:03:08,966
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you have a follow-up question on that point?

480
01:03:09,466 --> 01:03:15,448
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, just for clarity, are we going to allow pot shops on Salem Street since it's now a corridor?

481
01:03:22,050 --> 01:03:22,830
[SPEAKER_16]: Go back to President Bears.

482
01:03:23,031 --> 01:03:23,371
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks.

483
01:03:32,765 --> 01:03:39,672
[SPEAKER_12]: Just wanted to go through, discuss the process from here on out, just to confirm with everyone.

484
01:03:41,594 --> 01:03:41,834
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry.

485
01:03:43,556 --> 01:03:51,604
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, well, right now, it's allowed in C2 and industrial, right?

486
01:03:55,157 --> 01:04:05,883
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's special permanency to industrial, I think is the current, plus there's basically, you can't be within a certain number of feet from certain institutions, educational, religious, so.

487
01:04:10,746 --> 01:04:12,087
[SPEAKER_12]: Right, that shouldn't be carried through.

488
01:04:12,147 --> 01:04:13,988
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, I would say no, it's not.

489
01:04:14,909 --> 01:04:16,650
[SPEAKER_12]: It won't be in the Salem Street District.

490
01:04:17,170 --> 01:04:18,070
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd love confirmation.

491
01:04:20,307 --> 01:04:21,668
[SPEAKER_12]: But yeah, it shouldn't be.

492
01:04:21,688 --> 01:04:26,670
[SPEAKER_16]: And if it is, it's a type of... My apologies, President Bears, I thought that was direct response.

493
01:04:26,710 --> 01:04:30,971
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, in my understanding, it's only in the C sub-districts of which there's just that tiny parcel.

494
01:04:31,391 --> 01:04:32,752
[SPEAKER_16]: That's the current gas station remaining.

495
01:04:32,772 --> 01:04:37,514
[SPEAKER_12]: That was C1, so it was just probably carried over because... Yeah.

496
01:04:39,415 --> 01:04:39,915
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, great.

497
01:04:42,185 --> 01:04:46,768
[SPEAKER_12]: I think to the larger point, I just wanted to go through the process from this point forward.

498
01:04:46,908 --> 01:04:54,212
[SPEAKER_12]: So assuming that the committee votes to refer out a proposal tonight, that would appear on the regular agenda for our next regular meeting.

499
01:04:54,893 --> 01:04:57,474
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just want you guys to correct me if I'm wrong at any point.

500
01:04:58,835 --> 01:05:06,520
[SPEAKER_12]: That would be referred to the Community Development Board, and the Community Development Board would hold a public hearing where further public comment could be taken.

501
01:05:07,836 --> 01:05:19,262
[SPEAKER_12]: And then that would come back to the city council for a public hearing after a recommendations are made by the community development board, at which point it would require a further vote of the council to amend the zoning ordinance.

502
01:05:19,822 --> 01:05:20,763
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that correct?

503
01:05:23,464 --> 01:05:23,624
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

504
01:05:24,925 --> 01:05:25,085
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

505
01:05:29,349 --> 01:05:29,509
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

506
01:05:29,729 --> 01:05:31,771
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's two more public hearings after tonight.

507
01:05:32,231 --> 01:05:32,431
Great.

508
01:05:32,611 --> 01:05:32,971
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

509
01:05:33,232 --> 01:05:33,432
[SPEAKER_16]: Great.

510
01:05:34,092 --> 01:05:34,953
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for reiterating.

511
01:05:34,973 --> 01:05:36,394
[SPEAKER_16]: Great.

512
01:05:36,494 --> 01:05:36,674
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

513
01:05:36,694 --> 01:05:37,915
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll go down to public participation.

514
01:05:37,935 --> 01:05:40,997
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to alternate between the podium and participants on zoom.

515
01:05:41,137 --> 01:05:41,957
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to set a timer.

516
01:05:42,017 --> 01:05:45,259
[SPEAKER_16]: Every person who'd like to speak, we'll have three minutes.

517
01:05:45,820 --> 01:05:54,605
[SPEAKER_16]: And then at the end Councilors or at the end of all public participation, Councilors and associates, city staff may speak again if they wish.

518
01:05:56,406 --> 01:05:57,427
[SPEAKER_16]: Name and address, sorry.

519
01:05:57,727 --> 01:05:58,688
[SPEAKER_16]: Name and address for the record, please.

520
01:06:05,024 --> 01:06:12,566
[SPEAKER_17]: Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street, ground zero for this outrageous proposal. I know everyone was looking for a simplification.

521
01:06:12,946 --> 01:06:20,628
[SPEAKER_17]: Simplification is 3,000 square foot lot would allow a minimum of six units of housing, which is an attack on my neighborhood.

522
01:06:20,708 --> 01:06:25,209
[SPEAKER_17]: Currently, you need 5,000 square feet to build a single, and this would be

523
01:06:26,533 --> 01:06:36,083
[SPEAKER_17]: The equivalent of 12 for where you could normally build a single and an area with severely restricted parking and a very narrow, very busy street.

524
01:06:36,584 --> 01:06:45,113
[SPEAKER_17]: If you've asked anyone in any of these neighborhoods, and this is not limited to Salem Street, this is going fingering down all the side streets in that area.

525
01:06:46,795 --> 01:06:56,199
[SPEAKER_17]: all this dense housing, not one single person living in that area, and there's someone here who doesn't live in that area, and we'll tell you it's great, has said we'd love more traffic.

526
01:06:56,579 --> 01:07:04,942
[SPEAKER_17]: We'd love six units of housing on a three foot square lot, and oh, please don't make them build parking because we have so much extra parking.

527
01:07:05,262 --> 01:07:06,343
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't have any parking.

528
01:07:07,123 --> 01:07:09,544
[SPEAKER_17]: Salem Street is not a bustling commercial corridor.

529
01:07:09,984 --> 01:07:16,287
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a mix of convenience stores, smoke shops, pizza places, and lots of already dense housing.

530
01:07:17,423 --> 01:07:27,051
[SPEAKER_17]: It's an always busy cut through street made more narrow recently despite the high volume of trucks and out of service buses that pass through all day.

531
01:07:27,711 --> 01:07:44,185
[SPEAKER_17]: The parking is so scarce that the traffic department didn't remove one single spot when adding in their dangerous bike lane that cars and trucks drive through all day as the lane on the other side is too small to accommodate large vehicles safely.

532
01:07:45,362 --> 01:07:54,225
[SPEAKER_17]: Many side streets, including Park Street, Parris Street, Court Street, have areas where there is no parking allowed on the street.

533
01:07:54,625 --> 01:07:55,746
[SPEAKER_17]: The streets are too narrow.

534
01:07:56,106 --> 01:07:57,386
[SPEAKER_17]: You can't fit cars there.

535
01:07:59,127 --> 01:08:06,830
[SPEAKER_17]: The lots are small, and these joining changes would destroy the area and add so many cars with nowhere to park them and so many people.

536
01:08:08,735 --> 01:08:19,167
[SPEAKER_17]: These tall buildings with little to no parking will destroy the quality of life for the area between shadow and lack of parking and increases to already heavy traffic.

537
01:08:19,948 --> 01:08:25,755
[SPEAKER_17]: A single bus comes down this road once or twice an hour at the busy times.

538
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:35,023
[SPEAKER_17]: Perhaps you're unfamiliar with Salem Street, but if you go out the parking lot, take a right, go to the second exit around the Rotary, you'll see us.

539
01:08:35,243 --> 01:08:35,743
[SPEAKER_17]: We're there.

540
01:08:36,103 --> 01:08:37,103
[SPEAKER_17]: We're paying taxes.

541
01:08:37,663 --> 01:08:39,624
[SPEAKER_17]: We're a very dense and busy area.

542
01:08:40,244 --> 01:08:43,905
[SPEAKER_17]: What you won't see there is a bustling commercial corridor.

543
01:08:44,746 --> 01:08:55,229
[SPEAKER_17]: Our quality of life can't constantly be on the table in order to only increase density in the areas that are already too dense, the areas that you're dismissing.

544
01:08:56,553 --> 01:08:59,814
[SPEAKER_17]: If you need density, perhaps it's time to look west.

545
01:09:00,994 --> 01:09:01,434
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

546
01:09:02,915 --> 01:09:03,115
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

547
01:09:03,295 --> 01:09:04,115
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for your comments.

548
01:09:04,175 --> 01:09:06,776
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll switch next to Zoom and then back to the podium.

549
01:09:07,676 --> 01:09:07,896
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

550
01:09:08,176 --> 01:09:10,217
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to unmute you, Martha.

551
01:09:10,317 --> 01:09:11,997
[SPEAKER_16]: Name and address for the record, please.

552
01:09:12,277 --> 01:09:13,018
[SPEAKER_16]: You have three minutes.

553
01:09:16,519 --> 01:09:17,019
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

554
01:09:17,099 --> 01:09:17,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

555
01:09:19,079 --> 01:09:33,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I want to speak to a similar issue, which is that because of the way this process is designed, zoning gets addressed without addressing the streetscape and the road issues.

556
01:09:33,594 --> 01:09:40,562
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is siloing things that really need to be solved together.

557
01:09:41,537 --> 01:10:02,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I would, I know that I don't want to hold up the endorsement of this zoning ordinance, which is primarily concerned with land use and building dimensions, but we do need as a city to look at these land use changes in conjunction with pedestrian

558
01:10:03,525 --> 01:10:09,670
[SPEAKER_04]: and cycle and bus and transit safety and convenience.

559
01:10:10,590 --> 01:10:18,396
[SPEAKER_04]: These roads, they're susceptible to speeding and bad driver behavior because of their design.

560
01:10:18,516 --> 01:10:28,403
[SPEAKER_04]: And the design really needs to be adapted to provide, if you want to call this a vital area with ground floor commercial,

561
01:10:29,451 --> 01:10:32,213
[SPEAKER_04]: we need to make sure people can walk here safely.

562
01:10:33,114 --> 01:10:40,499
[SPEAKER_04]: And that includes the intersecting significant side streets like Park and Spring Street.

563
01:10:41,220 --> 01:10:54,330
[SPEAKER_04]: It's good that the traffic, the parking, there are incentives to the land use developers to put parking behind the buildings or under, covered under the buildings.

564
01:10:54,570 --> 01:10:56,731
[SPEAKER_04]: And the curb cuts would be

565
01:10:57,975 --> 01:11:01,557
[SPEAKER_04]: around to the back and not interrupting the sidewalk.

566
01:11:01,737 --> 01:11:17,185
[SPEAKER_04]: But we really need to look at the street not as a kind of negative space that isn't part of the plan, but as a vital part of this plan and understand what's going on with the sidewalks and the public spaces.

567
01:11:17,585 --> 01:11:17,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

568
01:11:20,807 --> 01:11:20,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

569
01:11:21,167 --> 01:11:22,148
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for your comments, Martha.

570
01:11:22,168 --> 01:11:23,969
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, we'll go back

571
01:11:26,328 --> 01:11:27,032
[SPEAKER_16]: To the podium now.

572
01:11:27,716 --> 01:11:28,944
[SPEAKER_16]: Name and address for the record, please.

573
01:11:29,901 --> 01:11:30,661
[SPEAKER_16]: You have three minutes.

574
01:11:30,982 --> 01:11:32,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeanne Iselle 35 Paris Street.

575
01:11:33,243 --> 01:11:36,925
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm an industry professional for several decades, but I'm here as a director.

576
01:11:38,086 --> 01:11:38,986
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a few thoughts.

577
01:11:39,006 --> 01:11:40,887
[SPEAKER_02]: They're a little disjointed, I apologize.

578
01:11:40,987 --> 01:11:58,858
[SPEAKER_02]: But I want to understand what the actual and specific criteria you are using to separate what parcels benefit from this zoning bump, and specifically your IZ status and what ones don't.

579
01:12:00,154 --> 01:12:08,338
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to point out that ground level commercial plus two is the basis for human scale development and activating spaces.

580
01:12:08,858 --> 01:12:17,282
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's perplexing to me that there are any areas where you're looking to delete or disincentivize that specific model in any way, shape or form.

581
01:12:18,345 --> 01:12:24,011
[SPEAKER_02]: Three, I want to let you know that there is nothing you are creating here that will lend itself to a BI district.

582
01:12:24,471 --> 01:12:38,365
[SPEAKER_02]: And I tell you that as someone who has spent over 25 years as an industry professional identifying site selection and overseeing commercial construction buildup for hundreds of clients in every vertical there is.

583
01:12:39,506 --> 01:12:45,150
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to point out that this is an environmental justice neighborhood according to the GIS mapping.

584
01:12:45,550 --> 01:12:49,673
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's made up of exactly the demographic we look to not gentrify out.

585
01:12:50,073 --> 01:12:54,136
[SPEAKER_02]: And your proposal on Salem Street will gentrify this neighborhood.

586
01:12:54,536 --> 01:12:55,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Make no mistake about it.

587
01:12:56,497 --> 01:13:17,109
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to point out to you that the criteria you use relative to Salem Street regarding interconnection you outlined for Mystic and Salem would also apply to Route 60 that goes to Arlington and Playstead that goes to Route 38, whose exact intersection sits on an MBTA train station.

588
01:13:17,609 --> 01:13:22,372
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd like to know when we can look forward to this MBTA zoning to be applied over there.

589
01:13:23,172 --> 01:13:31,097
[SPEAKER_02]: And then my last thought for you tonight is when you really know your subject matter, you can easily simplify it to make it accessible and inclusive for all.

590
01:13:31,397 --> 01:13:37,301
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would encourage you to do that because most people in the city do not have the luxury of understanding zoning.

591
01:13:37,702 --> 01:13:38,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

592
01:13:42,605 --> 01:13:53,409
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for your comments, and as one quick note, we will be visiting West Medford in our citywide review of the zoning ordinance that'll be coming in the spring of 2025.

593
01:13:53,489 --> 01:13:57,171
[SPEAKER_16]: We're looking at West Medford so residents can look forward to that.

594
01:13:57,931 --> 01:13:59,411
[SPEAKER_16]: We will switch back to Zoom now.

595
01:13:59,431 --> 01:14:03,293
[SPEAKER_16]: Jayme, I'm going to ask you to unmute, name and address for the record, please, and you have three minutes.

596
01:14:06,445 --> 01:14:07,226
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening, everybody.

597
01:14:07,826 --> 01:14:09,888
[SPEAKER_13]: Just had a couple of questions for clarity.

598
01:14:11,349 --> 01:14:19,635
[SPEAKER_13]: On the area median income at 80 and 65%, could you define that in current dollar value, just for those that aren't aware of current AMIs?

599
01:14:19,655 --> 01:14:30,644
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, sorry, did I lose?

600
01:14:34,761 --> 01:14:35,041
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

601
01:14:37,382 --> 01:14:38,462
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah Jamie.

602
01:14:38,522 --> 01:14:38,923
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

603
01:14:38,983 --> 01:14:42,544
[SPEAKER_16]: If you have other questions, feel free to will bucket these and we'll address them all.

604
01:14:43,224 --> 01:14:46,126
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay And then, uh, just two other questions.

605
01:14:46,506 --> 01:14:46,646
[SPEAKER_13]: Um.

606
01:14:47,666 --> 01:14:50,047
[SPEAKER_13]: On the depth into the side streets.

607
01:14:50,187 --> 01:14:52,569
[SPEAKER_13]: There's obviously a discrepancy in some areas.

608
01:14:52,609 --> 01:14:56,830
[SPEAKER_13]: There's two lots, three lots or four lots deep into the side streets that was

609
01:15:03,148 --> 01:15:03,628
[SPEAKER_13]: that we're using.

610
01:15:03,648 --> 01:15:08,270
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the calculation is used for defining those lots that were you, uh, expanded and re zoned.

611
01:15:09,310 --> 01:15:12,892
[SPEAKER_13]: Was it a foot scale or, you know, just for clarification there.

612
01:15:15,293 --> 01:15:15,473
[SPEAKER_16]: Great.

613
01:15:15,513 --> 01:15:15,773
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

614
01:15:15,793 --> 01:15:20,394
[SPEAKER_16]: We have a question about am I and then the calculation used for lot extension onto the side streets.

615
01:15:20,815 --> 01:15:24,536
[SPEAKER_16]: Any other questions that you wanted to pose to, uh, last question.

616
01:15:25,576 --> 01:15:27,677
[SPEAKER_13]: Obviously in hearing from residents are Jamie

617
01:15:33,703 --> 01:15:44,855
[SPEAKER_13]: I've received feedback from residents in the area regarding the activation of Park Street and Salem Street at that intersection, obviously taking into consideration the Robert School, the commuter and pedestrian traffic there during school hours.

618
01:15:45,336 --> 01:15:51,703
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you go into the thoughtfulness that you went through in determining the MX2 zoning for the lots around that area?

619
01:15:54,949 --> 01:15:55,209
[SPEAKER_16]: Great.

620
01:15:55,870 --> 01:15:56,590
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you so much, Jamie.

621
01:15:56,650 --> 01:16:11,283
[SPEAKER_16]: So we have questions around approximate dollar value for AMI, for the incentive zoning, which is, you know, a citywide thought process or calculation behind the lot extension onto the side streets.

622
01:16:11,924 --> 01:16:19,831
[SPEAKER_16]: And then to, again, revisit the thinking behind the Parks and Salem Street intersection designation at MX2.

623
01:16:21,232 --> 01:16:22,273
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you so much for those questions.

624
01:16:22,473 --> 01:16:25,035
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to let, I see one more person for public participation.

625
01:16:25,095 --> 01:16:30,280
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think we're going to round that out and then we'll respond to all questions in a batch.

626
01:16:31,401 --> 01:16:31,721
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

627
01:16:36,185 --> 01:16:36,465
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

628
01:16:36,725 --> 01:16:37,826
[SPEAKER_16]: Name and address for the record, please.

629
01:16:37,846 --> 01:16:38,527
[SPEAKER_16]: And you have three minutes.

630
01:16:39,528 --> 01:16:41,970
[SPEAKER_07]: Marian Tomaszczuk, 29 Garfield Avenue.

631
01:16:42,670 --> 01:16:45,873
[SPEAKER_07]: And I am also right in Salem Street.

632
01:16:47,282 --> 01:16:49,963
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm disabled, so I don't drive.

633
01:16:49,983 --> 01:16:55,605
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a pedestrian, and I move there because I have easy access to everything.

634
01:16:56,446 --> 01:17:01,388
[SPEAKER_07]: This will destroy my walkability, my neighborhood.

635
01:17:02,048 --> 01:17:05,429
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very difficult now with all the traffic.

636
01:17:06,610 --> 01:17:11,752
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you change the corridor, I will not be able to.

637
01:17:12,321 --> 01:17:12,982
[SPEAKER_07]: to get around.

638
01:17:14,444 --> 01:17:20,331
[SPEAKER_07]: It was hard enough when the buses stopped and now there's only one bus, I can only get to town.

639
01:17:21,032 --> 01:17:23,334
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't get around Medford anymore.

640
01:17:24,296 --> 01:17:25,857
[SPEAKER_07]: And I can't get to other cities.

641
01:17:31,946 --> 01:18:01,029
[SPEAKER_07]: Narrowing of the street by putting in the bike paths, so now that the cars and trucks and buses all drive on the wrong side of the road and in the bus, the bike lane, means that when I walk down the street to go to Haines Square, or down towards the square, means that Harley motorcycles are coming at me on the sidewalk, and scooters, and regular buses, because there's no room for them on the street.

642
01:18:02,386 --> 01:18:12,392
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that street is so dense, it's so backed up all the time, that motorcycles don't want to wait behind.

643
01:18:13,312 --> 01:18:14,673
[SPEAKER_07]: And they drive on the sidelines.

644
01:18:16,334 --> 01:18:20,236
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have never seen Harley Davidsons coming at me before.

645
01:18:21,457 --> 01:18:22,778
[SPEAKER_07]: You put those lines in the street.

646
01:18:23,779 --> 01:18:27,961
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was not prepared for that the first time one came at me.

647
01:18:29,727 --> 01:18:33,091
[SPEAKER_07]: So I have to be quite aware, and I have a balance disorder.

648
01:18:34,212 --> 01:18:36,714
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't want to be aware of that.

649
01:18:37,115 --> 01:18:41,540
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't need to be looking out for Harley Davidson's coming at me.

650
01:18:42,841 --> 01:18:49,248
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't need to have to worry about being in the shade all the time because there's going to be high rises.

651
01:18:50,851 --> 01:18:54,352
[SPEAKER_07]: There shouldn't be cars so dense.

652
01:18:54,452 --> 01:18:55,813
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a neighborhood.

653
01:18:56,433 --> 01:18:59,935
[SPEAKER_07]: This is not a bustling business area.

654
01:19:00,695 --> 01:19:10,739
[SPEAKER_07]: And now you're going to get rid of all the little businesses, and you're going to try to build it up high and awful when this is a beautiful neighborhood that I know all the neighbors in my street.

655
01:19:11,659 --> 01:19:13,060
[SPEAKER_07]: I know all the people around.

656
01:19:13,420 --> 01:19:15,841
[SPEAKER_07]: When my husband passed away, everybody was there for me.

657
01:19:17,096 --> 01:19:20,438
[SPEAKER_07]: When there's different things going on, everybody's there.

658
01:19:21,358 --> 01:19:23,419
[SPEAKER_07]: When I was ill, everybody was there for me.

659
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:25,600
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a neighborhood.

660
01:19:27,021 --> 01:19:28,181
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a community.

661
01:19:29,442 --> 01:19:33,244
[SPEAKER_07]: This is not, you know, just Medford.

662
01:19:33,704 --> 01:19:37,966
[SPEAKER_07]: This is Medford, the community, and you want to destroy it.

663
01:19:39,244 --> 01:19:41,985
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a narrow, dense street.

664
01:19:42,165 --> 01:19:49,366
[SPEAKER_07]: When the kids are getting out of school and everything and going to school and there's activities, that street is bombarded with cars.

665
01:19:49,686 --> 01:19:50,847
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no place to park.

666
01:19:51,347 --> 01:19:54,467
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you know the Roberts doesn't have enough parking for the teachers?

667
01:19:55,247 --> 01:19:59,768
[SPEAKER_07]: That the teachers have to park all along Park Street and all along the neighborhood?

668
01:20:00,609 --> 01:20:02,009
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they didn't make it big enough.

669
01:20:03,083 --> 01:20:05,505
[SPEAKER_07]: When the parents come, they are all over the place.

670
01:20:06,226 --> 01:20:07,487
[SPEAKER_07]: You cannot go down the street.

671
01:20:07,507 --> 01:20:10,109
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why they have to close the streets nearby the schools.

672
01:20:10,969 --> 01:20:14,932
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're saying that these buildings don't have to provide enough parking.

673
01:20:15,553 --> 01:20:20,817
[SPEAKER_07]: All the apartments in different places nearby are not required by zoning to have enough apartments.

674
01:20:20,917 --> 01:20:21,438
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, no.

675
01:20:21,738 --> 01:20:23,699
[SPEAKER_07]: The apartments that you've approved.

676
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:24,240
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

677
01:20:24,260 --> 01:20:24,960
[SPEAKER_16]: You have 20 seconds left.

678
01:20:24,980 --> 01:20:25,221
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

679
01:20:25,241 --> 01:20:31,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, when they were approving before, the hole in the ground that has been there for years, when they were approving

680
01:20:32,168 --> 01:20:36,829
[SPEAKER_07]: parking for that, they weren't even approving one car per unit.

681
01:20:37,530 --> 01:20:46,212
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we know that going forward on these apartments, you're not going to require one apartment, one car per unit, and we can't handle it.

682
01:20:46,372 --> 01:20:48,433
[SPEAKER_07]: So we cannot handle what you're proposing now.

683
01:20:48,853 --> 01:20:51,154
[SPEAKER_07]: Go to the bigger street, High Street and Main Street.

684
01:20:51,314 --> 01:20:51,654
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

685
01:20:52,022 --> 01:20:52,742
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for your comments.

686
01:20:53,923 --> 01:20:55,243
[SPEAKER_16]: I appreciate that.

687
01:20:55,683 --> 01:21:02,726
[SPEAKER_16]: I just want to note that this proposal doesn't change any existing parking ratios, ratios per unit.

688
01:21:03,186 --> 01:21:07,128
[SPEAKER_16]: That's true of all the zoning proposals that this council has reviewed so far.

689
01:21:07,188 --> 01:21:13,030
[SPEAKER_16]: I also want to note that a lot of the ground floor commercial businesses along Salem Street are nonconformant with the current zoning.

690
01:21:13,430 --> 01:21:15,771
[SPEAKER_16]: This proposal would allow them.

691
01:21:16,857 --> 01:21:17,778
[SPEAKER_16]: just a point of clarification.

692
01:21:18,719 --> 01:21:21,182
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll go next to Zoom.

693
01:21:21,522 --> 01:21:23,024
[SPEAKER_16]: I saw Ellery's hand.

694
01:21:23,204 --> 01:21:24,305
[SPEAKER_16]: First, I'll ask to unmute you.

695
01:21:24,325 --> 01:21:26,268
[SPEAKER_16]: I need your name and address for the record, please.

696
01:21:27,309 --> 01:21:28,170
[SPEAKER_16]: And you have three minutes.

697
01:21:29,793 --> 01:21:30,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi there.

698
01:21:30,753 --> 01:21:31,773
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Ellery Klein.

699
01:21:32,174 --> 01:21:37,095
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm at 37 Fells Avenue, so I'm just up the hill from this area.

700
01:21:38,955 --> 01:21:41,856
[SPEAKER_05]: I am generally in support of these changes.

701
01:21:43,076 --> 01:21:50,618
[SPEAKER_05]: When people talk about being fearful, I am fearful that my children won't have anywhere to live in a city where rents are now averaging three to

702
01:21:52,212 --> 01:21:55,735
[SPEAKER_05]: $3,500 a month, so I'm excited to see new building.

703
01:21:56,676 --> 01:21:58,237
[SPEAKER_05]: I would echo what Martha said.

704
01:21:58,377 --> 01:22:15,532
[SPEAKER_05]: I do think, and you can see from the many comments before and after her that people are concerned about the streetscape here and pedestrian safety, cycling safety, and that I would encourage you to really integrate the street design and

705
01:22:17,546 --> 01:22:19,908
[SPEAKER_05]: all those things as we begin to build this street.

706
01:22:20,909 --> 01:22:29,537
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think that they can be separated, especially at a place like Felsway West and Salem.

707
01:22:29,557 --> 01:22:35,082
[SPEAKER_05]: That intersection is extremely wide and you end up with all kinds of dangerous situations there.

708
01:22:35,985 --> 01:22:43,008
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so I think that if we redeveloped and didn't think about things like that, um, we'll be making mistakes.

709
01:22:43,028 --> 01:22:48,230
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would definitely encourage, um, as much as we can to integrate, um, those things.

710
01:22:48,750 --> 01:22:57,554
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I would love to just say that I would love to, um, see some flexibility and creativity on parking minimums.

711
01:22:58,514 --> 01:22:58,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Um,

712
01:22:59,485 --> 01:23:05,647
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that all these comments demonstrate that people don't really mind new people moving in, they mind more cars.

713
01:23:06,767 --> 01:23:12,829
[SPEAKER_05]: And as we can see, we already have too many cars driving through and parked around.

714
01:23:13,549 --> 01:23:23,872
[SPEAKER_05]: So any way we could find to get developers to maybe be able to exchange things like a parking space for a free MBTA bus pass as part of the rental or

715
01:23:24,580 --> 01:23:31,083
[SPEAKER_05]: exchange two parking spaces for a zip car shared space or bike share or something like that.

716
01:23:31,183 --> 01:23:34,704
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we could be creative with getting people out of cars.

717
01:23:35,945 --> 01:23:38,206
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'd love to see some creative thinking like that.

718
01:23:39,026 --> 01:23:45,449
[SPEAKER_05]: These are ideas in Schoop's book, The High Cost of Free Parking.

719
01:23:46,009 --> 01:23:52,332
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we generally try to market price our parking more in the city of Medford, instead of just market pricing housing for people,

720
01:23:52,694 --> 01:23:56,757
[SPEAKER_05]: We also might want to push harder to market price parking and storage of cars.

721
01:23:57,317 --> 01:24:01,960
[SPEAKER_05]: And that will free up some space as people decide it's not worth to have a car.

722
01:24:02,020 --> 01:24:12,607
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would also point out that the better bus project does have the 96 bus, which will be a every 15 minute bus running all the way down Salem from Malden.

723
01:24:12,667 --> 01:24:15,729
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's going to go through Davis Square and all the way to Union Square.

724
01:24:15,809 --> 01:24:19,672
[SPEAKER_05]: So we will have at some point there is in the works.

725
01:24:20,296 --> 01:24:22,317
[SPEAKER_05]: increased bus service on this corridor.

726
01:24:22,397 --> 01:24:26,740
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think it would be good to push for more of that.

727
01:24:29,121 --> 01:24:33,163
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would also actually agree that restricting the commercial ground floor.

728
01:24:35,144 --> 01:24:39,086
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if it's necessarily a good idea for a walkable neighborhood with more people.

729
01:24:39,106 --> 01:24:46,831
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be nice to have rents and I think letting the developers decide whether or not it's worth it to put that in there might be a good idea.

730
01:24:47,571 --> 01:24:48,792
[SPEAKER_05]: But thank you for all this hard work.

731
01:24:49,719 --> 01:24:59,967
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that not everyone's going to be happy, but I think that more spaces for people to live is going to be great for the city of Medford and the state of Massachusetts.

732
01:24:59,987 --> 01:25:00,487
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you.

733
01:25:01,628 --> 01:25:01,808
[SPEAKER_16]: Great.

734
01:25:02,329 --> 01:25:03,069
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you so much, Ellery.

735
01:25:04,270 --> 01:25:05,171
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll go back to the podium.

736
01:25:06,011 --> 01:25:07,432
[SPEAKER_16]: Name and address for the record, please.

737
01:25:07,472 --> 01:25:08,113
[SPEAKER_16]: You have three minutes.

738
01:25:08,844 --> 01:25:12,327
[SPEAKER_11]: William Navarre, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

739
01:25:13,008 --> 01:25:15,350
[SPEAKER_11]: My first point is just on the step backs.

740
01:25:16,291 --> 01:25:21,495
[SPEAKER_11]: I was able to seek from Danielle some clarification on what that means.

741
01:25:22,796 --> 01:25:31,924
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess that's measured from the facade, no matter how, even if the facade is 20 feet from the street, which is the maximum permitted setback.

742
01:25:32,945 --> 01:25:34,526
[SPEAKER_11]: If the goal is to allow

743
01:25:35,567 --> 01:25:35,868
[SPEAKER_11]: light.

744
01:25:36,328 --> 01:25:38,150
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not quite sure that's necessary.

745
01:25:38,190 --> 01:25:40,112
[SPEAKER_11]: I would say just measure from the bit above setback.

746
01:25:41,114 --> 01:25:49,042
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you put the ground floor at three feet, which is the bit above 13 feet, you can put your fourth floor.

747
01:25:50,104 --> 01:25:52,326
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think that that would be a problem.

748
01:25:53,567 --> 01:25:55,690
[SPEAKER_11]: If the goal is light, I feel like that would be sufficient.

749
01:25:56,907 --> 01:26:02,730
[SPEAKER_11]: rather than if they put in a further setback voluntarily to have a front yard, I don't see why you need a further setback.

750
01:26:05,291 --> 01:26:14,395
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that the plan should consider increasing the intensity of the very large target lot and its neighbors.

751
01:26:16,496 --> 01:26:24,880
[SPEAKER_11]: I think on such a large lot, you could have quite a bit more housing and more height without really causing a problem.

752
01:26:25,270 --> 01:26:34,754
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, you could utilize additional step backs if you wanted to, in order to prevent whatever concerns the hype would cause there.

753
01:26:34,774 --> 01:26:39,476
[SPEAKER_11]: The developers are going to have plenty of room to institute those step backs.

754
01:26:42,377 --> 01:26:46,399
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess there's going to be parking coming back around, as Ellery said.

755
01:26:46,419 --> 01:26:52,922
[SPEAKER_11]: And I look forward to that discussion and hope that we can consider whether or not

756
01:26:53,757 --> 01:26:59,322
[SPEAKER_11]: mandating parking for cars makes sense at this juncture, given our city's priorities.

757
01:27:00,022 --> 01:27:00,823
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think it does.

758
01:27:02,925 --> 01:27:07,909
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that intensity along the very wide road near the rotary is appropriate.

759
01:27:08,429 --> 01:27:12,072
[SPEAKER_11]: That's very near to here, just the other side of this rotary.

760
01:27:12,212 --> 01:27:15,175
[SPEAKER_11]: It's very near to Bedford Square.

761
01:27:15,195 --> 01:27:17,977
[SPEAKER_11]: And the road is incredibly wide.

762
01:27:18,398 --> 01:27:20,940
[SPEAKER_11]: The status quo is three-story buildings there, basically.

763
01:27:23,235 --> 01:27:30,620
[SPEAKER_11]: And when it gets redeveloped, I think we could go something more intense than three stories, especially because the road is so wide.

764
01:27:30,640 --> 01:27:33,041
[SPEAKER_11]: So those are the suggestions I have.

765
01:27:33,181 --> 01:27:33,501
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

766
01:27:36,543 --> 01:27:37,163
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much.

767
01:27:37,444 --> 01:27:38,524
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll go back to Zoom.

768
01:27:38,544 --> 01:27:46,769
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to hear from folks who haven't spoken before, and then we can take an additional minute of comment from folks who have already spoken.

769
01:27:47,909 --> 01:27:49,691
[SPEAKER_16]: Dave, please go ahead.

770
01:27:49,731 --> 01:27:51,572
[SPEAKER_16]: Name and address for the record.

771
01:27:51,612 --> 01:27:52,172
[SPEAKER_16]: You have three minutes.

772
01:27:54,451 --> 01:27:57,116
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, David McKenna to Vine Street.

773
01:27:57,317 --> 01:27:59,140
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm going to butter on Salem Street.

774
01:28:00,283 --> 01:28:01,084
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to start by

775
01:28:01,903 --> 01:28:11,127
[SPEAKER_10]: echoing the point that William finished with, which is from Vine Street, it's a five-minute walk to City Hall, seven minutes if I want to go to the buses behind City Hall.

776
01:28:11,687 --> 01:28:14,869
[SPEAKER_10]: So I really do feel like I live at an extension.

777
01:28:14,889 --> 01:28:18,010
[SPEAKER_10]: I live just down the street by JRA Cycles.

778
01:28:18,490 --> 01:28:23,973
[SPEAKER_10]: So five minutes to City Hall, I think that that neighborhood is an extension of Medford Square.

779
01:28:25,153 --> 01:28:31,937
[SPEAKER_10]: and that it could be, you know, take advantage of that to help build up Medford Square.

780
01:28:31,997 --> 01:28:48,546
[SPEAKER_10]: And so the current recommendations don't have much height or, you know, there's, I would recommend more like the MX2, you know, right around or just a taller residential.

781
01:28:49,339 --> 01:29:00,382
[SPEAKER_10]: as part of Medford Square, just in that last corridor around Hadley Place, Fulton, Vine, Everett, Court Street.

782
01:29:01,862 --> 01:29:09,525
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the things I really like about living in the area, just to echo the point of another speaker, is you can walk to everything.

783
01:29:11,185 --> 01:29:14,766
[SPEAKER_10]: My wife and I share one car and we probably use the car twice a week.

784
01:29:15,869 --> 01:29:17,290
[SPEAKER_10]: because we can walk to everything.

785
01:29:17,450 --> 01:29:19,070
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I take the bus to work.

786
01:29:21,131 --> 01:29:28,173
[SPEAKER_10]: There's restaurants, you know, there's stores, modern hardware, Eddie's Pizza, Hubbard & Sons.

787
01:29:29,213 --> 01:29:32,114
[SPEAKER_10]: All of those businesses are nonconforming under the current zoning.

788
01:29:32,614 --> 01:29:34,295
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not allowed to exist there.

789
01:29:35,035 --> 01:29:40,977
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I really do support legalizing the commercial, you know, the things that make the neighborhood walkable.

790
01:29:43,134 --> 01:29:46,736
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, daycares, all that makes the neighborhood walkable.

791
01:29:46,756 --> 01:29:47,997
[SPEAKER_10]: So I really applaud that.

792
01:29:49,058 --> 01:29:54,381
[SPEAKER_10]: I wanted to suggest an idea because so much of the existing commercial is non-conforming.

793
01:29:55,562 --> 01:29:56,943
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't have the right setbacks.

794
01:29:56,983 --> 01:30:00,165
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't have the right dimensional requirements.

795
01:30:01,508 --> 01:30:02,189
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's there.

796
01:30:02,769 --> 01:30:10,512
[SPEAKER_10]: And so if JRA Cycles is a thriving business and they want to add a story on top of their building, that's not permitted because they don't have the right setback.

797
01:30:10,552 --> 01:30:12,013
[SPEAKER_10]: They would have to go to the ZBA.

798
01:30:12,613 --> 01:30:25,559
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, so I would suggest a rule that any existing commercial building or any existing building, you know, could be built up to the height that is allowed under the zoning rules.

799
01:30:26,585 --> 01:30:39,569
[SPEAKER_10]: In other words, JRA could put a second commercial story on top to expand their business, or they could put apartments on top of whatever the current footprint is, even though it has zero setback in the back, zero setback on the sides.

800
01:30:41,089 --> 01:30:50,392
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a great contribution to our neighborhood, and you wouldn't want to have to tear down the building and build a smaller building in its place.

801
01:30:50,412 --> 01:30:53,072
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't really make sense to me.

802
01:30:56,431 --> 01:30:57,832
[SPEAKER_16]: Great, thank you, Dave.

803
01:30:58,812 --> 01:31:00,713
[SPEAKER_10]: Do I just have another moment?

804
01:31:01,913 --> 01:31:02,554
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, you're at time.

805
01:31:02,594 --> 01:31:03,474
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll give you 30 more seconds.

806
01:31:04,515 --> 01:31:08,556
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I love the inclusive zoning promotes improvements to the streetscape.

807
01:31:08,596 --> 01:31:10,597
[SPEAKER_10]: So I do think that's gonna make our streets safer.

808
01:31:10,657 --> 01:31:13,299
[SPEAKER_10]: So I applaud you for doing that with inclusive zoning.

809
01:31:13,999 --> 01:31:23,983
[SPEAKER_10]: And my idea to reduce cars is to disallow city street parking permits for the new apartments.

810
01:31:24,123 --> 01:31:25,244
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, if people don't want cars,

811
01:31:25,831 --> 01:31:27,413
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't give them parking permits.

812
01:31:28,715 --> 01:31:29,015
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

813
01:31:32,159 --> 01:31:32,880
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much, Dave.

814
01:31:33,701 --> 01:31:36,505
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, we'll go next to Ren on Zoom.

815
01:31:36,765 --> 01:31:38,728
[SPEAKER_16]: Please name and address for the record.

816
01:31:38,788 --> 01:31:39,649
[SPEAKER_16]: You have three minutes.

817
01:31:43,073 --> 01:31:43,173
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello.

818
01:31:47,589 --> 01:31:48,209
[SPEAKER_16]: You're off mute.

819
01:31:48,249 --> 01:31:49,529
[SPEAKER_16]: Name and address for the record, please.

820
01:31:49,589 --> 01:31:51,550
[SPEAKER_01]: You have three minutes.

821
01:31:51,570 --> 01:31:52,390
[SPEAKER_01]: Ren Veen 37 Woodrow Avenue.

822
01:31:52,890 --> 01:31:56,171
[SPEAKER_01]: I live right near Salem Street, about a half mile away.

823
01:31:57,571 --> 01:32:02,772
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just wanted to express general support for this rezoning effort.

824
01:32:03,212 --> 01:32:09,894
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it makes a ton of sense to, you know, update the zoning rules to allow existing uses.

825
01:32:11,405 --> 01:32:18,811
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's really kind of bringing the code up to reality and encouraging more of what we like in this area.

826
01:32:19,472 --> 01:32:25,917
[SPEAKER_01]: I think people that live in the area enjoy the businesses that are there and we'd like to see more development like that.

827
01:32:26,637 --> 01:32:42,411
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to add support to Dave McKenna's idea of allowing the existing businesses maybe a special allowance to, you know, for folks that own their buildings to, you know, build up and get some return on their investment in Medford by

828
01:32:43,211 --> 01:32:58,183
[SPEAKER_01]: contributing maybe housing or additional space for their local business to get some of the benefit of these additional allowances that the zoning is gonna do, even if their existing building doesn't meet the setbacks and things that the new code is going to define.

829
01:32:59,083 --> 01:33:00,604
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a really good idea.

830
01:33:00,724 --> 01:33:03,967
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I saw that anywhere in the literature, and I hope folks are taking a note of that.

831
01:33:05,948 --> 01:33:11,432
[SPEAKER_01]: I also don't know what the details might be on the

832
01:33:12,754 --> 01:33:20,398
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there was a mention at the beginning of the meeting about some of the community contributions that developers could offer, you know, for incentives.

833
01:33:20,478 --> 01:33:23,680
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw the table there, I think in the Mystic Ave order.

834
01:33:23,720 --> 01:33:26,802
[SPEAKER_01]: There was also expanded definitions in the Mystic Ave meetings.

835
01:33:29,604 --> 01:33:31,805
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard talk earlier, I think Scarpelli was talking about

836
01:33:32,205 --> 01:33:36,651
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe making the documents a little clearer for people that are just opening their neighborhood.

837
01:33:37,112 --> 01:33:48,247
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to dig through three and four versions of the Mystic Ave corridor, which isn't really near where I live, so I wasn't paying as much attention to, to find some of the definitions for the additional uses that are being added.

838
01:33:49,187 --> 01:33:57,132
[SPEAKER_01]: It would just be really nice to have those, you know, expanded and amended definitions just available on any of these documents, it could be as simple as a copy paste from meeting to meeting.

839
01:33:57,612 --> 01:34:02,155
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that would be beneficial to future neighborhoods, as you were bringing these around the city.

840
01:34:03,945 --> 01:34:06,748
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's, that's basically all I wanted to say, I think this is good.

841
01:34:06,768 --> 01:34:10,091
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's, it's thoughtful being done deliberately.

842
01:34:10,111 --> 01:34:19,481
[SPEAKER_01]: I think some of the folks with concerns about parking are not wrong that you build a bunch of housing without being thoughtful about that, you know, it could create a problem so I think that.

843
01:34:20,301 --> 01:34:27,163
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, creating additional, uh, you know, uh, incentives for things that would reduce traffic would be really smart.

844
01:34:27,583 --> 01:34:36,084
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if the city has any ability to look at directing more of the truth through traffic to the exit North folks, getting off 93, trying to hit Bell's way.

845
01:34:36,705 --> 01:34:43,366
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, Google will often send you down, uh, Salem, which might be good if you want to stop and get a cup of coffee that helps the business, but

846
01:34:44,016 --> 01:34:50,982
[SPEAKER_01]: Bell's Way is a more appropriate artery to direct people to, but that circle is in such bad shape right now that people aren't taking it.

847
01:34:51,422 --> 01:35:06,914
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope when that is improved, the traffic situation on Salem will also improve, but I wonder if the city could think about anything they could do to, you know, encourage through traffic to use that exit, because that would, I think, help the traffic on Salem Street, which, you know, nobody wants to see more of.

848
01:35:07,475 --> 01:35:07,895
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

849
01:35:09,076 --> 01:35:10,437
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you so much for your comments, Ran.

850
01:35:12,734 --> 01:35:16,176
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, I don't see any more hands raised on Zoom or in person.

851
01:35:16,196 --> 01:35:22,740
[SPEAKER_16]: I do want to make sure we double back to a couple specific questions that were raised earlier in public participation.

852
01:35:22,760 --> 01:35:32,485
[SPEAKER_16]: I have some numbers up relating to some quick numbers for area median income, but I suspect there's somebody on that side of the rail who can state it more quickly and eloquently than me.

853
01:35:34,867 --> 01:35:37,968
[SPEAKER_16]: Alicia, Danielle, Emily, Paula, would you like to speak to that question?

854
01:35:37,988 --> 01:35:40,870
[SPEAKER_16]: Or I can read off my spreadsheet.

855
01:35:47,484 --> 01:35:52,933
[SPEAKER_16]: And this was just to put some kind of, you know, comprehensible dollar figures to that concept of we talked about 80% AMI, 65% AMI.

856
01:35:53,014 --> 01:35:54,276
[SPEAKER_16]: If you like, yeah, I don't think we

857
01:36:05,828 --> 01:36:08,310
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, yes we are working on screen sharing.

858
01:36:08,770 --> 01:36:10,911
[SPEAKER_15]: So the document that I was able to find.

859
01:36:11,431 --> 01:36:29,941
[SPEAKER_15]: Now I have had others is from the Massachusetts housing partnership, it is their income limits for 2024 area median income this particular document is referring to homeownership but it would also equally apply to renter.

860
01:36:30,501 --> 01:36:31,101
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't take that away.

861
01:36:33,215 --> 01:36:38,439
[SPEAKER_15]: So they usually give the hundred percent income level and the 80% income level.

862
01:36:38,879 --> 01:36:46,644
[SPEAKER_15]: I did calculate the 65% income level for one of the groups, it's always by household size.

863
01:36:47,085 --> 01:36:56,111
[SPEAKER_15]: So what you'll see up there is that we have household size of one, the hundred percent income limit for Middlesex County,

864
01:36:56,911 --> 01:36:59,892
[SPEAKER_15]: which would include Medford is 114 250, the 80% income level is 91400 again for a household of one.

865
01:36:59,912 --> 01:37:03,633
[SPEAKER_15]: So you can see that progressing all the way up to a household of eight if we weren't zoomed out.

866
01:37:13,556 --> 01:37:17,818
[SPEAKER_15]: I did the calculation on a household of four just because it was sort of midway through.

867
01:37:17,838 --> 01:37:22,260
[SPEAKER_15]: So 100% income level is 163,200 for Middlesex County 80% income level would therefore be 130,550, and then the 65% income level would be 106,000,

868
01:37:35,806 --> 01:37:39,167
[SPEAKER_15]: 080.

869
01:37:35,866 --> 01:37:39,167
[SPEAKER_15]: So again, it's done by the household size.

870
01:37:41,768 --> 01:37:52,672
[SPEAKER_15]: Other ways to look at it, US Housing and Urban Development Department will also use the, this is usually based on the metro region.

871
01:37:53,212 --> 01:38:00,355
[SPEAKER_15]: So this would be the Boston, Quincy, Cambridge metro region, you may sometimes see it based on that, but that's where these numbers are derived from.

872
01:38:01,515 --> 01:38:02,156
[SPEAKER_15]: ultimately.

873
01:38:02,656 --> 01:38:16,186
[SPEAKER_15]: And the only thing I will add is that for many communities that are in these larger metro regions, the 80% income level doesn't necessarily represent affordability in that particular community.

874
01:38:17,007 --> 01:38:23,972
[SPEAKER_15]: So when you look at the incentives, the reason that we put in something like an incentive for 65% of AMI is to address the fact that 80% of income may not

875
01:38:28,295 --> 01:38:30,177
[SPEAKER_15]: be affordable for everyone.

876
01:38:30,938 --> 01:38:38,005
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's why we try and look at the issue of deeper affordability as well as more affordable units.

877
01:38:39,847 --> 01:38:40,047
[SPEAKER_16]: Great.

878
01:38:40,765 --> 01:38:41,666
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you so much for that.

879
01:38:42,066 --> 01:38:49,770
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's helpful to put, you know, kind of understandable numbers that people can think in terms of rent checks or mortgage payments when we talk about these percentages.

880
01:38:49,830 --> 01:38:50,171
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

881
01:38:50,191 --> 01:39:02,878
[SPEAKER_16]: And then the other two specific questions were around, I know you mentioned in the presentation on that question of where should be MX1, where should be MX2 and the intersection of Salem and Park Street specifically.

882
01:39:02,898 --> 01:39:08,702
[SPEAKER_16]: I recall you saying, you know, paraphrasing, where will we have those more active intersections where there's,

883
01:39:09,122 --> 01:39:17,773
[SPEAKER_16]: more ground floor businesses where it's a busier intersection where there's already more, those are in the proposal characterized as MX2 to reflect that.

884
01:39:17,854 --> 01:39:20,617
[SPEAKER_16]: Can you talk a little bit about Park and Salem specifically?

885
01:39:25,303 --> 01:39:27,326
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, gosh, this mic system.

886
01:39:28,078 --> 01:39:34,100
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, I keep thinking green means go so I keep saying no you have to wait for red I'm like this is not working.

887
01:39:35,300 --> 01:39:53,106
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, so I think this this answer I hope might address some of the questions about why we did x versus y. So for the city Councilors for town for city staff, they may remember that we had this workshop in June, where we presented a whole host of maps.

888
01:39:53,766 --> 01:40:11,620
[SPEAKER_15]: And those maps on the spatial analysis, primarily done by Jimmy looked at the non conforming dimensional standards so what's there now in terms of lots in terms of buildings, so parcel sizes setbacks building footprints coverage, etc.

889
01:40:12,621 --> 01:40:27,092
[SPEAKER_15]: It also included demographic standards or numbers so we looked at the EJ areas, we did look and this is citywide but we've also zoomed down into district by district.

890
01:40:28,493 --> 01:40:36,139
[SPEAKER_15]: We looked at hydrography, we looked at flooding, we looked at income levels, we looked at race and ethnicity.

891
01:40:36,499 --> 01:40:40,242
[SPEAKER_15]: So we tried to get from a mapping standard a picture of the entire city.

892
01:40:40,362 --> 01:40:48,489
[SPEAKER_15]: And then the goal is, as we address each of these areas, we've been talking a lot about Mystic and Salem today and the past couple of months.

893
01:40:48,949 --> 01:40:54,773
[SPEAKER_15]: but there are other corridors, there are squares, there are neighborhoods, there are commercial nodes within neighborhoods.

894
01:40:55,294 --> 01:40:59,077
[SPEAKER_15]: All of these are being addressed as we move forward with the process.

895
01:40:59,837 --> 01:41:11,566
[SPEAKER_15]: So as we zoom into Salem Street, the idea was to understand which parcels were conforming now, which were non-conforming, the ways in which they were non-conforming,

896
01:41:12,126 --> 01:41:14,987
[SPEAKER_15]: and address as much as possible what those were.

897
01:41:15,127 --> 01:41:28,813
[SPEAKER_15]: So a lot of the, whether it's MX1, MX2, or it's the multi-unit residential, is based on those, started to be based on those non-conformities.

898
01:41:29,333 --> 01:41:32,898
[SPEAKER_15]: Then we took it up another layer and that became about the connection.

899
01:41:33,039 --> 01:41:44,235
[SPEAKER_15]: So Paula described at the beginning, this idea of where's the school, where are the parks, what are the primary streets that are connecting these destinations and how do they connect back to Salem Street.

900
01:41:45,336 --> 01:42:00,209
[SPEAKER_15]: And so, the MX to kind of in the center there close to the school that was really about creating this mixed use node with greater density greater commercial around the streets that had those connections to other community amenities.

901
01:42:00,829 --> 01:42:17,083
[SPEAKER_15]: As we move over initially the target area we had proposed as commercial, we heard public feedback that might that and we heard some more of it tonight that maybe that should be mixed to a greater densification we heard potentially even greater densification for that.

902
01:42:17,663 --> 01:42:21,405
[SPEAKER_15]: Tonight, we would like to consider that further.

903
01:42:21,425 --> 01:42:32,810
[SPEAKER_15]: I think the comments that we heard tonight about Mix 1 closer to Medford Square, we would like to take that up again when we look at Medford Square, which again is coming in March.

904
01:42:32,870 --> 01:42:35,311
[SPEAKER_15]: It makes sense to say, okay, we did this for Salem.

905
01:42:35,791 --> 01:42:40,834
[SPEAKER_15]: Do we need to take another look at that now that we're looking at the totality of Medford Square?

906
01:42:41,654 --> 01:43:00,801
[SPEAKER_15]: And I do want to stress that this is one of the reasons that with this group, we had talked about a month or two ago about the idea that as we finish the geographic areas, as we finish the topical areas, we know we're coming back to you already and say, hey, we did this back in November and December.

907
01:43:01,181 --> 01:43:07,143
[SPEAKER_15]: We need to look at it again because we learned other things about other parts of the city when applying zoning to it.

908
01:43:07,663 --> 01:43:09,244
[SPEAKER_15]: that has implications.

909
01:43:09,345 --> 01:43:21,194
[SPEAKER_15]: So I do want to stress that we're very much listening tonight to the concerns, but also the hopes and understanding that there are some that we can make changes to now and some we'd like to come back to.

910
01:43:21,234 --> 01:43:36,806
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that issue of mix two versus something else at the target site, the issue of mix one or something else down as we get to the rotary close to the square, I think those can, may remain as open issues as we move forward and then we circle back to them.

911
01:43:38,356 --> 01:43:39,837
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you so much, really appreciate that.

912
01:43:41,419 --> 01:43:55,832
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think the way it was phrased in the suggestion, the way you phrased it just now, that we're doing this in a geography by geography basis, knowing that all of these geographies are really close together and the changes we make in one neighborhood will affect, they all affect the context.

913
01:43:57,053 --> 01:44:02,177
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think it can make a lot of sense when we do visit Medford Square in a couple of months.

914
01:44:02,918 --> 01:44:18,628
[SPEAKER_16]: When we're looking at that proposal when we've come to, you know, close to consensus on that proposal to then look to the, you know, areas of the abutting geographies and say, now that we've made these decisions, what, how does that imply, how does that implicate the decisions that we've made in this neighboring area and, you know, kind of be continuing to

915
01:44:19,028 --> 01:44:27,241
[SPEAKER_16]: think about these questions of where we know we need density, where does it make the most sense where should we do that, where should we prioritize for densification or any of the other goals that we have.

916
01:44:27,261 --> 01:44:29,244
[SPEAKER_16]: I also want to note because you talked about it.

917
01:44:30,225 --> 01:44:34,031
[SPEAKER_16]: If folks are interested in the those kind of like aerial maps.

918
01:44:34,952 --> 01:44:43,578
[SPEAKER_16]: that Emily mentioned that kind of informed some of these decisions about like what to prioritize where on the city zoning page and MedfordMA.org slash zoning.

919
01:44:43,698 --> 01:44:51,563
[SPEAKER_16]: Scroll down this time beyond phase two meeting documents under resources, click down from citywide maps, click on land use maps.

920
01:44:52,204 --> 01:45:04,532
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a world of details you can get lost in, but I know for folks who are really interested in this stuff, that's your window into the maps that the council and the consultant and city staff looked at several times earlier in this process to inform some of what we're putting where.

921
01:45:05,533 --> 01:45:06,013
[SPEAKER_16]: Director Hunt.

922
01:45:07,695 --> 01:45:08,076
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

923
01:45:08,216 --> 01:45:15,204
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought there were a couple of various comments that I thought were worthy of just addressing and making sure people had the full picture.

924
01:45:18,191 --> 01:45:21,954
[SPEAKER_06]: To be clear, zoning cannot make Salem Street wider.

925
01:45:21,974 --> 01:45:28,359
[SPEAKER_06]: It cannot say anything about the public parking spots, the bike lanes, yes or no.

926
01:45:28,459 --> 01:45:29,980
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are not part of zoning.

927
01:45:30,461 --> 01:45:33,783
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are things that would go through traffic commission and our traffic department.

928
01:45:34,084 --> 01:45:37,006
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just want to set expectations about what we can and can't do.

929
01:45:40,408 --> 01:45:49,012
[SPEAKER_06]: The chair Collins did mention that the MBTA does have in every 15 minute or more often bus planned for Salem Street.

930
01:45:50,552 --> 01:45:52,373
[SPEAKER_06]: So that is something that is in the works.

931
01:45:52,433 --> 01:45:57,035
[SPEAKER_06]: It is not in the first phase of the MBTA redesign that is starting this weekend.

932
01:45:57,095 --> 01:46:01,097
[SPEAKER_06]: It's at least it sounds like at least a year out, but it is coming.

933
01:46:03,097 --> 01:46:05,718
[SPEAKER_06]: to clarify a few things that were said.

934
01:46:05,778 --> 01:46:07,459
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a new building that was permitted.

935
01:46:07,839 --> 01:46:15,102
[SPEAKER_06]: It was permitted at one parking spot per unit on the corner of Salem and Park.

936
01:46:15,202 --> 01:46:16,762
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't know when it's going to be built.

937
01:46:16,842 --> 01:46:18,103
[SPEAKER_06]: People ask us that a lot.

938
01:46:20,003 --> 01:46:23,524
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually back on the market for sale with all its permits.

939
01:46:23,825 --> 01:46:26,786
[SPEAKER_06]: So we really don't know when, even though it has its building permits.

940
01:46:27,646 --> 01:46:30,767
[SPEAKER_06]: At this time, all the other unit, all the other

941
01:46:31,670 --> 01:46:45,860
[SPEAKER_06]: units being allowed on here would be some version of multifamily, which currently require 1.5 spots per unit, and that is something that we're going to take up when we look at parking and transportation in the spring.

942
01:46:48,302 --> 01:46:51,104
[SPEAKER_06]: There was another conversation about

943
01:46:52,893 --> 01:46:53,874
[SPEAKER_06]: existing buildings.

944
01:46:53,934 --> 01:46:59,096
[SPEAKER_06]: So there are a number of existing buildings that would like to add another story or two or three.

945
01:46:59,937 --> 01:47:05,339
[SPEAKER_06]: In some cases it's hypothetical from the neighbors and others we've kind of heard some from property owners.

946
01:47:06,160 --> 01:47:16,065
[SPEAKER_06]: If the building itself under this new zoning becomes conforming because now it's allowed to be a commercial building sitting there and its setbacks etc are allowed,

947
01:47:16,985 --> 01:47:20,728
[SPEAKER_06]: then it could take advantage of this new zoning by right, and it could build.

948
01:47:21,389 --> 01:47:39,583
[SPEAKER_06]: If it is non-conforming because, say, it doesn't have the right setbacks or something like that, then it would be a non-conforming existing use, and it could ask for a special permit from the Zoning Board of Appeals, which is a lower threshold than a variance.

949
01:47:40,303 --> 01:47:58,248
[SPEAKER_06]: And if what they wanted to do was generally allowed by zoning, say it doesn't have the right setback, but is otherwise now conforming, and what they want to do would be in conformance with this, it would be a very easy barrier to overcome at the ZBA.

950
01:47:58,268 --> 01:48:02,309
[SPEAKER_06]: They'd have to go through that, but it's not a tough measure to meet.

951
01:48:03,129 --> 01:48:06,810
[SPEAKER_06]: The one other thing is that we did in our setbacks require

952
01:48:07,411 --> 01:48:11,507
[SPEAKER_06]: set back far enough so that the sidewalk would be 12 feet wide.

953
01:48:13,137 --> 01:48:24,981
[SPEAKER_06]: So in some places, the sidewalk is that wide, but a new building in order to be conforming would actually have to set back far enough from the edge of the road to allow a 12-foot sidewalk.

954
01:48:25,321 --> 01:48:27,202
[SPEAKER_06]: So that will make things more walkable.

955
01:48:28,703 --> 01:48:32,684
[SPEAKER_06]: And it says it must be paved so that that becomes part of the sidewalk area.

956
01:48:32,944 --> 01:48:37,306
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just did want to flag that for everybody who's concerned about the walkability of this area.

957
01:48:37,806 --> 01:48:39,886
[SPEAKER_06]: I myself ride my bike on Salem Street.

958
01:48:39,906 --> 01:48:41,007
[SPEAKER_06]: I get it.

959
01:48:42,248 --> 01:48:46,494
[SPEAKER_06]: And I actually do this Washington Street, Salem Street intersection thing.

960
01:48:46,674 --> 01:48:49,078
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a little dicey sometimes, so I get it.

961
01:48:51,004 --> 01:48:55,525
[SPEAKER_06]: were there, I feel like there might have been some other things that we could address if you want us to.

962
01:48:56,125 --> 01:48:57,786
[SPEAKER_06]: They would like to address some other items.

963
01:48:58,006 --> 01:48:58,406
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, great.

964
01:48:58,446 --> 01:49:09,568
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'll just flag the last, the final question that was specifically asked, which goes back to the previous question was, um, the areas where the zoning proposal, it sometimes extends to parcels north and south.

965
01:49:09,629 --> 01:49:19,871
[SPEAKER_16]: It sometimes extends for, I think that dovetails is what you were saying about looking at the geographies, looking at the overlapping characteristics, but just in case there was anything you wanted to add on that, um, those decisions and specifically.

966
01:49:21,067 --> 01:49:21,568
[SPEAKER_07]: If you'd like, yeah.

967
01:49:29,887 --> 01:49:38,294
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, that was because depend in here we have very regular parcels in law in size and shapes.

968
01:49:40,195 --> 01:49:50,664
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we did was to study exactly what was going on in those parcels sometimes even the mixed use extends, for example, because that is already a multi

969
01:49:51,945 --> 01:49:56,628
[SPEAKER_03]: multi-unit building that could be in this new zoning.

970
01:49:57,269 --> 01:50:04,613
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and the others is just to make that transition, make that make sense in this area.

971
01:50:04,653 --> 01:50:19,463
[SPEAKER_03]: So we went parcel by parcel, checking what was there, looking at the surroundings and what we were proposing and see how that was better transition towards the residential neighborhoods that are already there.

972
01:50:20,103 --> 01:50:25,547
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is really mapping what is there and what it made sense.

973
01:50:26,427 --> 01:50:34,833
[SPEAKER_03]: So it didn't have this very different uses in conjecture.

974
01:50:37,315 --> 01:50:38,035
[SPEAKER_16]: Great, thank you.

975
01:50:38,075 --> 01:50:43,799
[SPEAKER_16]: I appreciate the very granular approach that you took to deciding where the corridor starts and ends.

976
01:50:44,983 --> 01:51:03,257
[SPEAKER_15]: I will add if I may that one of the two things I wanted to address one of them is when you start looking at parcels and ownership and you find this may or may not have been the case but I have certainly found that you will have a building that unaccountably straddles two parcels or

977
01:51:03,977 --> 01:51:08,360
[SPEAKER_15]: The owner owns the lot for the building and the lot next to it for the parking.

978
01:51:08,480 --> 01:51:18,487
[SPEAKER_15]: And so you really have to do the exact granular analysis that Paola mentioned to understand what the conditions are and why they're there.

979
01:51:18,647 --> 01:51:26,613
[SPEAKER_15]: And then this idea, OK, if we're going to do this type of use here, this type of dimensional standards here, how do we feather that down?

980
01:51:26,653 --> 01:51:32,877
[SPEAKER_15]: How do we bring that down to the neighborhood level so you don't have the stark contrasts that we are trying to avoid?

981
01:51:34,218 --> 01:51:49,987
[SPEAKER_15]: I also with your permission want to just mention the incentives again I think we heard some concerns, obviously about the streetscape which we've discussed what zoning cannon cannot do, but also the, the idea of gentrification or displacement.

982
01:51:50,808 --> 01:51:55,352
[SPEAKER_15]: There are a few things in the incentives that would help with that.

983
01:51:55,452 --> 01:52:04,680
[SPEAKER_15]: We are continuing to study ourselves, partly for this project, partly for other projects, other anti-displacement measures.

984
01:52:05,121 --> 01:52:10,305
[SPEAKER_15]: Two things in the current menu of incentives.

985
01:52:10,766 --> 01:52:14,069
[SPEAKER_15]: One, of course, is the affordability for residential, which we've already talked about.

986
01:52:14,749 --> 01:52:21,571
[SPEAKER_15]: But the other is this idea of providing lower rents for local businesses to help keep them in the area.

987
01:52:21,611 --> 01:52:27,732
[SPEAKER_15]: We do want to encourage neighborhoods supporting businesses in this area, and that's one way of doing it.

988
01:52:28,293 --> 01:52:37,695
[SPEAKER_15]: We think that as we get to the squares, both Medford Square and West Medford Square initially and some of the others, that this may be an opportunity to continue to explore

989
01:52:38,275 --> 01:52:44,460
[SPEAKER_15]: incentives for anti-displacement, and those may work their way back to Salem Street.

990
01:52:44,880 --> 01:52:47,822
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, this learning as we go, what works for which area.

991
01:52:47,842 --> 01:52:50,424
[SPEAKER_16]: Great.

992
01:52:50,844 --> 01:52:51,365
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you so much.

993
01:52:51,385 --> 01:52:52,366
[SPEAKER_16]: Appreciate that.

994
01:52:53,707 --> 01:52:54,187
[SPEAKER_16]: Quick follow-up.

995
01:52:54,247 --> 01:52:55,268
[SPEAKER_16]: I know President Bears has been waiting.

996
01:53:03,595 --> 01:53:05,336
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks, Madam Chair.

997
01:53:05,356 --> 01:53:06,797
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just wanted to build off a couple of things.

998
01:53:06,837 --> 01:53:19,323
[SPEAKER_12]: I think too, there was the granular analysis that was done, but also, you know, we're not going, when you look at the apartment one in the commercial districts, the parcel boundaries actually aren't that out of bounds.

999
01:53:19,384 --> 01:53:22,025
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just like the dimensional and the use requirements are kind of nuts.

1000
01:53:22,165 --> 01:53:27,288
[SPEAKER_12]: So it seems to me that by and large, that existing

1001
01:53:28,317 --> 01:53:33,220
[SPEAKER_12]: delineation was also used partly to outline some of the how far back things go.

1002
01:53:33,900 --> 01:53:40,684
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course, with some differences when you have that large apartment building on Paris Street, I think that, you know, was not in that zone.

1003
01:53:40,724 --> 01:53:48,588
[SPEAKER_12]: But in any case, I think the bigger question and the thought actually brings us all the way back to the beginning of the meeting.

1004
01:53:49,809 --> 01:53:54,331
[SPEAKER_12]: When we talk about walkability and accessibility and placemaking and streetscape.

1005
01:53:56,874 --> 01:54:00,617
[SPEAKER_12]: this is one piece of the implementation of the comprehensive plan.

1006
01:54:00,677 --> 01:54:02,859
[SPEAKER_12]: We're implementing land use and zoning policy.

1007
01:54:04,220 --> 01:54:23,437
[SPEAKER_12]: Emily and others have spoken to how incentive zoning and other elements here, and I'm also going to hopefully say in the future that site plan review processes and other things when things actually, you know, when this zoning actually turns into proposals and turns into construction of new buildings.

1008
01:54:26,030 --> 01:54:44,521
[SPEAKER_12]: That is where the rubber will meet the road to a large extent of actually improving the streetscape, getting a large new, say someone does want to put a few parcels together and build something big, not saying that that's what we want all over the place here, but they may need to give more back to the community to improve a stretch of the street.

1009
01:54:45,971 --> 01:55:05,656
[SPEAKER_12]: And so in addition to the traffic commission and all the other things that we want to do, a piece of this through the incentive zoning and through site plan review and through just the general transformation and goal that we want to see here over a long period of time, that is what will help us to make this a safer, more accessible, more walkable street.

1010
01:55:06,076 --> 01:55:12,858
[SPEAKER_12]: So when we see the implementation of the comprehensive plan recommendations,

1011
01:55:14,574 --> 01:55:27,609
[SPEAKER_12]: happening piecemeal because it has to happen piecemeal because we're just focused on the zoning piece right now it doesn't mean it's not that it's not factoring in these other questions around what it means to improve the street and actually

1012
01:55:28,504 --> 01:55:43,571
[SPEAKER_12]: this being an emanation or an iteration or an implementation of the comprehensive plan is an important thing to remind ourselves of because we can go back to the comprehensive plan and say, okay, one piece of creating these walkable vibrant neighborhoods is zoning.

1013
01:55:43,791 --> 01:55:51,134
[SPEAKER_12]: Another piece is something we may need to be talking about in our traffic commission or be talking about in another sense here in the community.

1014
01:55:51,154 --> 01:55:52,835
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just think that's important to note too.

1015
01:55:54,485 --> 01:56:00,427
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a great implementation table at the back of that comprehensive plan that is kind of its own.

1016
01:56:00,447 --> 01:56:07,130
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I can't even think of the word to describe it, but it's intense and this is a piece of that implementation.

1017
01:56:07,270 --> 01:56:20,235
[SPEAKER_12]: So I hope we can keep having the discussions and especially have the discussions when we have specific projects that want to be built coming after the establishing of the new zoning ordinance.

1018
01:56:21,579 --> 01:56:28,145
[SPEAKER_12]: I think there is that comprehensive holistic approach, and it just doesn't always get implemented all at the same time.

1019
01:56:28,206 --> 01:56:33,190
[SPEAKER_12]: And we're implementing different pieces of the comprehensive plan through different processes, and this is just one of them.

1020
01:56:34,211 --> 01:56:34,492
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks.

1021
01:56:37,214 --> 01:56:37,374
[SPEAKER_16]: Great.

1022
01:56:37,855 --> 01:56:41,879
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, President Pierce.

1023
01:56:42,299 --> 01:56:43,000
[SPEAKER_16]: Paula, something to add?

1024
01:56:47,688 --> 01:56:48,268
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, thank you.

1025
01:56:48,489 --> 01:56:52,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Just that I wanted to make two clarifications and that's it.

1026
01:56:52,750 --> 01:56:53,470
[SPEAKER_03]: I will be quick.

1027
01:56:53,911 --> 01:56:55,451
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry, can you speak up a little bit with the fan?

1028
01:56:55,491 --> 01:56:56,232
[SPEAKER_16]: It's very hard to hear.

1029
01:56:56,312 --> 01:57:00,453
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so I wanted to make two quick clarifications.

1030
01:57:00,513 --> 01:57:10,137
[SPEAKER_03]: The first one is that what we try to do in this corridor is to make it as a destination for the residential neighborhoods that are surrounding this corridor.

1031
01:57:10,357 --> 01:57:14,719
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not a city destination, so what we want is people to walk

1032
01:57:15,279 --> 01:57:17,680
[SPEAKER_03]: to this area, not to take the car.

1033
01:57:18,541 --> 01:57:31,308
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we want is to really make it walkable and to support the activities and the necessities of the residential neighborhoods that are in the vicinity.

1034
01:57:32,208 --> 01:57:33,429
[SPEAKER_03]: that is one clarification.

1035
01:57:33,529 --> 01:57:43,077
[SPEAKER_03]: And the second one, there was point out that in three, a thousand square foot lot, you could build a six building unit.

1036
01:57:43,177 --> 01:57:57,147
[SPEAKER_03]: And that it's in the zoning is true in the practical, it's not true because with the requirements of parking and only in three stories high, you will never be able to fit the six units.

1037
01:57:57,187 --> 01:57:58,709
[SPEAKER_03]: So you could fit three

1038
01:57:59,629 --> 01:58:13,518
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why we wanted to, because if we start with the dimensions that they have right now, which is from 5,000 and from 10,000 for multifamily, you will never be able to build because these are very small lots.

1039
01:58:14,118 --> 01:58:21,043
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they will have to be forced to unify lots in order to build big multi-unit buildings.

1040
01:58:21,563 --> 01:58:36,973
[SPEAKER_03]: So in order to make possible so that all the lots, not all of them, because some are very narrow and impossible to build, but the ones that are able to build a three-family unit building, that we could make that possible.

1041
01:58:37,153 --> 01:58:37,854
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why the 3,000.

1042
01:58:39,375 --> 01:58:47,160
[SPEAKER_03]: We really studied all the nonconformities and we wanted that everybody had the possibility if within reason of building.

1043
01:58:48,181 --> 01:58:48,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1044
01:58:51,408 --> 01:58:51,791
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1045
01:58:52,396 --> 01:58:52,900
[SPEAKER_16]: Director Hunt.

1046
01:59:05,267 --> 01:59:05,727
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1047
01:59:05,948 --> 01:59:18,337
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just wanted to sort of give one closing thought that people are still welcome to email us we recommend OCD at Medford ma.org, because several of our staff check that to make sure they're not lost.

1048
01:59:19,157 --> 01:59:24,762
[SPEAKER_06]: But if there are people who specifically feel that their parcel or a parcel they're aware of.

1049
01:59:26,042 --> 01:59:39,991
[SPEAKER_06]: should be in or out of one of these zones and it's adjacent to an existing like your parcel is in the white, it's not in the yellow and you would like it to be in the yellow, you can reach out to us and we will actually look at those on the case.

1050
01:59:40,311 --> 01:59:43,013
[SPEAKER_06]: We've looked at every one of these on a case by case basis.

1051
01:59:43,493 --> 01:59:44,554
[SPEAKER_06]: But if there was a reason.

1052
01:59:45,334 --> 01:59:47,095
[SPEAKER_06]: to include it that we weren't aware of.

1053
01:59:47,415 --> 01:59:55,579
[SPEAKER_06]: We're open to hearing those until the zoning gets passed, at which point it becomes extraordinarily difficult after the final vote of the second public hearing.

1054
01:59:56,560 --> 02:00:01,542
[SPEAKER_06]: So we do encourage people that we're open to individual changes on this.

1055
02:00:01,602 --> 02:00:03,223
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a parcel-by-parcel map.

1056
02:00:06,164 --> 02:00:06,405
[SPEAKER_16]: Great.

1057
02:00:06,865 --> 02:00:08,145
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for that, Director Hunt.

1058
02:00:08,185 --> 02:00:08,766
[SPEAKER_16]: Appreciate that.

1059
02:00:12,435 --> 02:00:20,441
[SPEAKER_16]: and good to know what the window of opportunity is for continuing to tweak individual parcels on the map before it gets, you know, to be a real case to be open to do that again.

1060
02:00:20,461 --> 02:00:33,470
[SPEAKER_16]: On that, so should this be reported out of committee tonight, then as we've said a lot of times before, we'll go to the city council and then be referred to the CDB for the recommendations and review and then back to the city council.

1061
02:00:34,211 --> 02:00:39,214
[SPEAKER_16]: Since we are speaking about, you know, this window of opportunity still being open for revisiting individual parcels,

1062
02:00:43,891 --> 02:00:52,059
[SPEAKER_16]: I wonder if it's something that the CDB might be able to specifically weigh in on, this one parcel that kind of sticks out more than all the others in this corridor, the target lot.

1063
02:00:52,699 --> 02:01:01,588
[SPEAKER_16]: As a result of Councilor and community feedback last meeting, that was changed from commercial to mixed use to to allow for ground floor commercial to allow for residential.

1064
02:01:04,315 --> 02:01:20,754
[SPEAKER_16]: This is kind of like the most unique lot on the corridor I think and I'm just wondering if we can while that window is open if we can continue if there's any other sub districts that we could carry in from the MACD so that we can capture all of those goals on this one very unique lot the ground floor commercial the residential and

1065
02:01:22,253 --> 02:01:26,075
[SPEAKER_16]: We have the benefit here of a lot of space, which isn't present elsewhere on the corridor.

1066
02:01:26,115 --> 02:01:35,279
[SPEAKER_16]: I wonder if we can consider more height there beyond just what's allowed for all of the other mixed use two parcels on this corridor, which the dimensions there are totally different than what we're looking for here.

1067
02:01:36,980 --> 02:01:48,526
[SPEAKER_16]: If that's something that the CDB and the consultants could weigh in on before the council sees this next, I think I'd be interested to see if there's any other creative

1068
02:01:51,249 --> 02:01:52,492
[SPEAKER_16]: sub-districts we could look at there.

1069
02:01:55,197 --> 02:01:57,902
[SPEAKER_16]: One day we'll get multiple microphones for this situation.

1070
02:01:59,505 --> 02:01:59,726
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1071
02:02:00,603 --> 02:02:02,084
[SPEAKER_15]: We're fine sharing, thank you.

1072
02:02:03,165 --> 02:02:24,620
[SPEAKER_15]: We're happy to look at that again and see if it makes sense to consider the Mix 3 or consider a variation on the Mix 2 so we can put our heads together about that and discuss with the CDB, weigh in with their thoughts, allow them to weigh in and public comment at that point because I think it's important to stress

1073
02:02:25,601 --> 02:02:30,405
[SPEAKER_15]: You all have done a good job of talking about the process, but noting that the process continues to be a public one.

1074
02:02:31,406 --> 02:02:47,441
[SPEAKER_15]: We are listening today, you all, and we will be listening over the next few meetings as well to see if there are other questions we can answer or changes that need to be made or changes that perhaps are not made now but are appropriate to continue as part of the conversation.

1075
02:02:49,423 --> 02:02:49,663
[SPEAKER_16]: Great.

1076
02:02:50,283 --> 02:02:50,804
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you so much.

1077
02:02:52,904 --> 02:02:55,205
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, well, this two hours is simply flown by.

1078
02:02:57,426 --> 02:03:02,289
[SPEAKER_16]: Are there any remaining questions or comments from councilors?

1079
02:03:05,251 --> 02:03:16,517
[SPEAKER_16]: Seeing none, the next step in this process would be for this to be referred out of committee to a regular meeting of the city council, where then procedurally it would be referred to the CDB for their review.

1080
02:03:18,478 --> 02:03:19,018
[SPEAKER_16]: Do I hear a motion?

1081
02:03:21,314 --> 02:03:25,418
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion by Councilor Leming to report out of committee, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

1082
02:03:29,302 --> 02:03:30,864
[SPEAKER_16]: Roll call votes, no longer necessary.

1083
02:03:30,884 --> 02:03:32,745
[SPEAKER_16]: All in favor?

1084
02:03:34,087 --> 02:03:34,647
[SPEAKER_16]: All opposed?

1085
02:03:35,708 --> 02:03:36,309
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion passes.

1086
02:03:39,332 --> 02:03:42,035
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion to adjourn by Councilor Callahan, seconded by Councilor Leming.

[SPEAKER_16]: Meeting is adjourned.

1091
02:03:48,574 --> 02:03:49,354
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, city staff.

1092
02:03:49,374 --> 02:03:57,137
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Ennis, for this proposal and for continuing to workshop it with us and to continue to take in our feedback and the feedback for the community.

1093
02:03:57,777 --> 02:03:57,977
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.
