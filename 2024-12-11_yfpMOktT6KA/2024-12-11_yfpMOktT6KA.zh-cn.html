 现在的五个礼物。
 没有。
 会议被要求订购。
 这次会议的行动讨论项目再次与Innes Associates团队进行了24-033分区条例更新。
 非常感谢您在这里。
 谢谢您，市工作人员在这里。
 感谢公众加入我们。
 我相信，这是16日，议程是与Innes Associates的第16个分区更新项目会议。
 本周，我们再次谈论塞勒姆街走廊分区提案讨论。
 上周，我们也谈到了这个话题。
 真的很高兴再次与大家谈论这一点。
 我只是要简要地重新引入这个特定的话题，然后将其交给
 我们将由Innes Associates和市政工作人员的评论进行演讲，然后将进行讨论。
 但是，只是为了迅速重新引入我们今天所说的话，这是我们第二次参加塞勒姆街走廊区的完整会议。
 这只是市议会在本学期内对全市分区进行系统审查和更新的一部分。
 我们一直在与Innes Associates合作，感谢您在这里，这也为这座城市提供了长达多年的全面计划过程。
 因此，与分区项目的其他方面一样，该走廊的建议是由恩尼斯（Ennis）在与哦，哦，谢谢您告诉我的。
 因此，分区顾问在与该委员会和市政府工作人员协商时制定的这些分区建议，所有这些都以全市目标和社区反馈为指导，如综合计划，住房生产计划，气候行动和适应计划。
 以及社区的投入和反馈，我们很幸运在这个过程中得到了。
 仅仅因为我借此机会这么说，在这些提案离开本委员会之后，他们回到市议会后，他们就必须将他们转介给社区发展委员会进行审查和建议，然后再次回到市议会，然后再进行这些投票。
 这是一个复杂的过程，所以我想尽可能多地重复它，因为我知道我花了一段时间才能内化它。
 So like I said, the initial draft of the Salem Street corridor zoning proposal was presented to this committee on December 3rd for some initial feedback, questions and comments.
 该项目提出了沿塞勒姆街（Salem Street）的走廊的新分区，其中包括大约两到四个地块，延伸到塞勒姆街（Salem Street）的北部和南部，从60号公路回旋处开始，一直延伸到海恩斯广场（Haines Square）。
 因此，该提案不包括这些边界之外的大塞勒姆街社区，尽管它确实触及了它们并且与它们相邻。
 为了进一步进入杂草。
 我将把它传递给Innes Associates进行演讲，我知道我们看到了与上周的演讲非常相似的演讲，但是我认为您将根据我们从社区获得的反馈以及议员和市政府工作人员的反馈来强调自上周以来已纳入的一些调整和变化。
 在我翻新之前，议员有任何初步评论或问题？
 好吧，太好了。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=780.237s">[Paula Ramos Martinez]</a>:  So I want to first start with the agenda.
 So we're going to talk about the process timeline.
 Then we're going to talk about the just simplified plan for 2025 that we already introduced on last meeting.
 I will do a small introduction why we are talking about Salem Street right now as a corridor.
 Where does that come from?
 We will talk about the current zoning that you have and then the proposed zoning that we are bringing today.
 Then Emily will go will continue to explain more the draft in detail.
 So, we started from July, we presented a workshop to the city Councilors and the city staff.
 with a lot of analysis, non-conforming maps, and getting all the suggestions and visions that they had.
 In August, we brought pre-designed and drafts of the zoning maps for Mystic Avenue and for Salem Street.
 Those are the two corridors that we are
 studying at the moment.
 In December 3, the last meeting that we had, we presented the corridor, the Salem Street.
 So this will be a continuation from that and with all the comments that were presented on that meeting and how we have adjusted some of those.
 we're going to be looking at.
 Um this.
 I will go very quickly.
 This is the plan 2025 that we have.
 So how we are going to geographically continue to study and do the analysis and the, um, update of the zoning.
 We will start January with North Medford, so we will study in the district's single family one and two.
 And then we will work on the
 we will talk about the neighborhood notes.
 Um then on February will, uh, work on South Medford.
 This is a part.
 The districts will be apartment one apartment to and general residential.
 Topics the same as before.
 We will also talk about the neighborhood notes.
 Um then in in March, we will talk about the Medford Square.
 Um, mainly commercial one.
 We will add more topics that we do have at the moment, but this is just an outline, so more things will come.
 And then in April, it will be West Medford, Commercial One's district, and in May, Wellington Glenwood area.
 We will talk about Office One, Two, Industrial, and Mass districts, and we will study the dimensional standards and development.
 So this is just an outline, we will continue to be more in depth of dates and the topics that we will discuss in each of these months.
 So our introduction is why we are talking about Salem Street.
 This comes from the Medford comprehensive plan that was released in January 2023.
 This was a plan that was made within two years of constant participation from the communities.
 and they did this complex result of all those studies that were made at that time.
 So we are just, our work, our job right now is to take those, the suggestion strategies from the comprehensive plan, from climate adaptation, action adaptation plan,
 and all the, from city staff and city councilors recommendations, and we are doing an upgrade of the zoning.
 So at the moment, we're studying the corridors.
 You can see it in this big image.
 All these purple lines are considered corridors.
 This means that they have specific characteristics.
 So they connect places, like for example, Salem Street connects Medford Square with Felsway,
 area and they have commercial and active ground floor.
 So these are the characteristics that set these areas and these streets to be corridors.
 So from this comprehensive plan, for example, we have one of these strategies.
 We zone to allow mixed use in village centers as of right in smaller nodes outside the traditional commercial squares such as Salem Street.
 So this is where we are coming from.
 We did Mystic Avenue, and that is a transformational rezoning that we are doing.
 And it's also citywide.
 So Mystic Avenue and Salem Street are very different in scale, and also who's serving.
 Salem Street, it's mainly serving the neighborhoods around it, the residential neighborhoods that are north and south of Salem Street.
 And so the density and the changes that we see from Mystic to Salem are considerably different.
 So the current zoning in Medford, what we are looking at is in this area that is marked in this black circle.
 If we do the zoom on that area, what we see is that we have two districts.
 One is the apartment that is in the southern part.
 So it's all this area.
 and then the northern part of Salem Street near Felsway, that is commercial one.
 And what we want to do is explain in here in this chart, in this table, what you can see is
 all the dimensional requirements for these districts.
 So Medford, what it does is apply dimensional standards per district, but also by use.
 So if the use is different, the dimensional standards are different.
 But what I wanted to mention is just to keep in mind that your current zoning, which is different from what you have right now there, from what it is constructed, what it exists there.
 In your zoning, the minimum lot size to construct is 5,000 for single family, 5,000 square foot lots.
 For a single family, 6,000 for two family.
 Then we have attached that I will explain later what that means.
 Multi-family is 10,000.
 And then any other principal structure is 10,000.
 Just so that we keep in mind.
 Apartment one does not allow commercial on your ground floor.
 So that is also interesting to retail or commercial in the ground floor.
 to keep in mind.
 And then the maximum that you could build is four stories high in apartment one.
 And that is depending on the use, it's usually three.
 But for example, for assisted living, there is four stories high.
 And then in commercial one, what you have is the minimum lot is 10,000 for multifamily and for assisted living.
 Then for hotel and other principal instructors and can be commercial, there is no minimum size.
 There are not minimum area, but there are minimum frontage.
 And for example, for the hotel minimum width and depth.
 Now, the heights in commercial one is six and in hotel is 15 stories high.
 So this is something that can happen right now by right.
 in those areas.
 So more in-depth, here you can see it with the diagrams.
 We are talking about this area, the apartment one, and what you can construct.
 So single family, 5,000 square feet, maximum height two and a half stories, single family attached, minimum lot area is 3,500, it's twice because it's in one end and the other, and the middle
 a single family dwelling is 2,500.
 This is a bit complicated, so if we want, I can explain that more.
 And the maximum height is three stories.
 And the multiple dwelling is a minimum of 10,000.
 Now, just be aware, this area, it's very historical.
 So the parcels that you have in there, the lots that we have there, are not very big.
 So a lot of this, more than 5,000 and especially 10,000, they will be non-conforming.
 So you wouldn't really be able to construct according this minimum areas.
 Now, if we go to the commercial, so this is the northern part, what you can construct is this multiple dwelling, is six stories high, and the minimum lot area is 10,000.
 Now, other principal structures, as I said, this doesn't have a minimum area, it has only minimum frontage, and then the maximum is four stories.
 This can be, for example, a commercial building.
 and then the hotel that has a minimum frontage of 50 and then 15 stories high.
 That can happen in any of the northern area of Salem Street that is commercial one.
 So what are we proposing is not looking at the code alone, the zoning code, but looking also at what it exists there.
 What is the real character of Salem Street?
 What is its identity?
 And so we divided in this four sub-districts.
 So we have mixed-use one, mixed-use two, commercial, and multi-unit residential.
 What we wanted is mainly on Salem Street, we're going to find mixed-use, well, let me rephrase this.
 So mixed-use two, which is the red lots,
 What are indicating is the areas that have better connection to the active areas in the neighborhood.
 So they will serve those active areas, like, for example, Piki Park, or these are better connections.
 We have a school in Park Street.
 So these kind of intersections where we see that can be a lot more active, these nodes are going to be a bit more densified than the rest.
 And that happened as well towards Felsway West, where we also have bigger lots and bigger opportunities.
 And this is, for example, one of the changes that we made is that the lots of the target and the MBTA storage area lot are being changed from commercial to mixed use too, so that residential can also happen in this area.
 We have just one little, for at the moment, one small commercial.
 This is a gas station, which we think that can happen there.
 So in order to maintain that use, we are considering commercial.
 What is the difference between mixed-use one, mixed-use two?
 These are lots, mixed-use one are lots that have a mix already with residential and commercial.
 And so if the lots have already that mix, we kept them as mixed-use.
 When one block was only residential, then we kept it as residential.
 So we didn't introduce more mixed use in the area, we just kept it because we thought that it will reaffirm the identity that it has now, which is a lot of mix between commercial in the ground floor and residential.
 Um I will explain now the uh standards but only before that um you see a lot of the between the Salem street lots and the neighborhoods we have what we call the transitional part or transitional lots and these are multi-unit residential and the idea is so that the heights and
 the youth would transitionally, gradiently will convert into those single family districts.
 So just to have a little bit clear of what are the minimum lot areas that we are proposing for these districts and the heights, I just want to mention that we have a difference between what the maximum height is as a base height, so what you can do.
 and when we include incentive zoning.
 And incentive zoning is that we give an exchange, we negotiate to increase the density, so increase the height, if they give back something to community, and we will talk about that later.
 So when you see this incentive zoning height, it's only if the developer is willing to give back something to the community.
 So the multi-unit residential minimum lot area is 3,000 square feet and maximum height three stories.
 Mixed use, the minimum lot area is 3,000 square feet and maximum height three stories plus one with incentive zoning.
 So it can be four and it's by right, but they have to do something for the community.
 And this extra step, extra story has to have a step back so it doesn't feel too much too high on the street level.
 Mixed use.
 This is the denser part.
 These are these nodes.
 The minimum lot area is 3,000 as well.
 Maximum height is four stories plus two with incentive zoning.
 These two also have a step back.
 And then commercial, the minimum lot area is 10,000 square feet.
 Maximum height is three stories plus three with incentive zoning.
 And from the fourth floor, two are a step back.
 So I just want to remember that these lots are not very big.
 They do not have a lot of depth.
 So just to keep in mind that the height that we are giving is the one that we really think is the best to densify, but also to not mess with the character of the area.
 So if we review what you have right now and with your current zoning, what you're going to see in these images is what wouldn't be allowed today by right in your zoning.
 So whenever we have in the first part of Salem Street commercial, it wouldn't be allowed.
 So this one story high with commercial is not allowed.
 It's not currently allowed.
 Yeah, it's not currently with your current zoning allowed.
 We want to change that.
 Then the multifamily, this is allowed.
 That's okay.
 And then on the lower picture where the residential is allowed, the commercial building next to it, it's not currently allowed.
 Same in the left corner.
 The commercial area is not allowed in this beautiful historical building.
 The ground floor is commercial, so it wouldn't be allowed in the current zoning.
 Gas stations are not allowed.
 That's something that we also encourage because you have four gas stations in Salem Street.
 Then again, every time that we see a commercial ground floor is not allowed, gas station, gas station, the residential, it is allowed.
 And this is the one that we also want to keep.
 So we are not changing that.
 commercial not allowed, residential yes it's allowed and we will keep as well in zoning, residential again is allowed and we will keep it.
 These are the two on the right are this block residential character that I was talking about that we decided to keep in the proposed zoning.
 And then on the left, on the inferior corner, on the lower corner, there is a house with a store front that wouldn't be allowed.
 If we go to the commercial, because lots of things are permitted in commercial one, everything is allowed.
 So here is some of the pictures that we wanted to show.
 What we are proposing is to have the ground floor commercial and to add a residential on top of it.
 Now the, these are all allowed.
 This is the target box building that we will talk about it later.
 This is the, in the lower part of the right, this is the Sunoco gas station.
 This is the one that we will keep because it's in Fells Way.
 We think it has good connection.
 It doesn't enter really to Salem Street.
 So we think it's a very good location for a gas station and it will serve the neighborhood as well.
 So that's why we kept that commercial in it.
 and then this is the what you have allowed in this area is an apartment of six stories, but that it has no step back.
 It doesn't look into the street.
 It doesn't activate the street.
 So we want to we have some standards.
 They mentioned development standards to make it a bit more
 coherent with what we have at the moment, so that's why we do these step backs, but also that that ground floor gets a lot of activity and it makes this street more vibrant and safe.
 Um, one of the things that we are adding that we didn't, uh, showed last time is this new definition of business incubator.
 This is something that city staff also thinks that can be very beneficial for the city.
 Um, and so we are bringing that
 definition so that we can also include it in our use table and so that this zoning will have this use permitted.
 So I'm just going to read it fast.
 An organization that assists early innovators achieve a minimum viable product or service and create an achievable plan to take that product or service to market.
 In addition to mentorship and investment opportunities, a business incubator gives access to logistical and technical resources, as well as shared office space, an incubator program can last for several months to a few years.
 So that's one of the additions that we're doing.
 Then on development and standards, because we heard some concerns about how this bigger development or bigger, higher density nodes that we are creating, how could that transit into the single family neighborhoods.
 We are bringing this development standards that is called neighborhood compatibility.
 And that says when an MX 1, 2 and commercial lot abuts a residential parcel, it shall be subject to context standards.
 And this is that we will take the maximum height that is on the setback line.
 on the side or rear line of the lot.
 So if the residential has a maximum of three stories, that is your maximum that you're going to start in your side or rear lot line.
 And then from there, you can gradually grow and go higher at a 45 degrees angle.
 And this is if I have
 I can go one story higher if I go, for example, 10 foot to the side, and then I can increase 10 foot on height.
 So that's how increasingly could give height to our new development.
 But at the same time, that there is a transition so you don't have a six story building next to your single family house.
 And this is for side and rear setbacks.
 As well that in these dimensional extenders, we do not have the side setbacks and rear setbacks are zero sometimes.
 So whenever it's zero, if you are about residential lot, your setback side or rear is going to be 10.
 So we also increase the side setbacks.
 Um, then just to, um, give up.
 We need to talk about parking and we will and there will be deeper study that we need to do.
 These lots, as I said many times are not very big.
 So the requirements of parking that exist at the moment, uh, these Lots are not able to, um
 They do not have that space, we will need to do more deep studies, but at the moment, it doesn't seem that there is enough space with your current zoning, it doesn't matter that is the new one or the older one.
 We just wanted to show first the development standards that we have on the draft is that the buildings to be on the sidewalk, so on the front lot line, and the parking to be located on the back of the lots.
 That can also be a cover parking as we see in the second one and the ground floor frontage can have a depth of 30 feet for example and then you can have your parking from it.
 In fact, the residential building, multifamily building that is already in Salem Street does something like this.
 And then for the bigger, bigger lots, we would encourage to have buildings on the front, parking on the interior.
 So as you can see in the last image.
 We will also introduce, because of this issue of parking in Salem Street, we want to introduce a new incentive zoning that is when they make available public parking, they can have a density bonus.
 So we need to continue to study this further.
 But this is the idea that we bring so that a lot of the stress that will be put in this small lots are not are taken by the bigger, bigger lots that can provide public parking.
 So the changes that are done to the previous draft, so the ones that you saw and the ones that you will see in the draft are the zoning map.
 So we did that change from commercial, these two lots on the northern part of Salem Street, from commercial to mixed use too.
 Table of Use Regulation.
 We have co-living by right in multi-unit residential district and in mixed use one district.
 Adult use is not permitted in commercial use in Salem Street.
 Parking in K-2 and J-9 have been
 detailed in this table of use, and we include incubator business as a use if it's something that you think we should include today.
 Table of dimension requirements, active ground floor, we change it to active frontage.
 There was a bit of misunderstanding, so we think active frontage is better.
 uh word for it and then we did some changes on the step back it's not all of them from the third floor but only in multi-residential is from the sorry from mixes one is on um above the third floor and then mixes two and commercial is above the fourth floor when we did this step back
 we brought the new definition of business incubator dimensional requirements and waivers.
 We introduced the we just amend this ground floor active frontage so that it's it corresponds with the dimensional requirements.
 And then the table of development incentive bonuses.
 We add the public parking to incentive to community amenities privately maintained.
 And now I will give the word to Emily Innes.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/yfpMOktT6KA&t=2361.775s">[Emily Innes]</a>: 因此，当Paola将我们切换到时，我只会说这是很多。
 我不会浏览单词的文字，但是我将向您和这个房间里的人们以及在家看着我们刚刚讨论过的更改的人们向您展示，以便当人们评论它时，他们会对看到的东西有所了解。
 因此，如果您可以切换到Word文档Paola，那就太好了。
 我确实想加强，因为我认为有些可能第一次进行调查的人可能会想知道，他们可能听说Mystic Avenue被称为走廊，Salem Street也被称为走廊，并想知道差异是什么。
 因此，我想强调Paola前面提到的这一想法，即神秘大道被视为变革型。
 这直接来自综合计划。
 它来自于在全面的计划过程开始以及与城市的对话之前进行的讨论。
 我认为，当我们看塞勒姆街（Salem Street）时，它是一个走廊，它正在连接两个不同的地方，但它也有可能成为现有社区的核心。
 正如Paola所指出的那样，我们做了很多工作以了解现在在地面上的事情，
 分区如何做和不鼓励现在的事物。
 公寓区有很多商业企业，该地区不允许商业企业使所有不合格的用途。
 那是有问题的。
 我们作为一个团队的维度标准研究确实显示了这也使其有问题的不合格数量。
 所以我们在塞勒姆街上的许多目标是
 有点适合分区和某些地方的规模，并增强了分区以及其他地方，所以我只想强调，这是我们的目标并研究了它。
 当我们查看分区本身时。
 您会发现我们已经完成了您已经在Mystic Avenue区已经看到的一些事情。
 我们添加了一些新事物，然后我们改变了一些事情，因为塞勒姆街绝对不是神秘的大道，我确实想强调这一点。
 因此，当我们浏览它时，您在分区中有一个部分，您可以在其中确定所有所有地区，现在就在那里，所以我们正在添加这个新的塞勒姆街四分之一区。
 我们还将对使用表法规进行修改，我知道我们有
 之前谈到了一个事实，即当我们完成所有这些工作时，我们将回来并将所有现在分开的作品整合在一起。
 因此，您将再次看到。
 这也启动了您在草稿中看到的颜色编码。
 因此，我们有这个黄色的亮点，表明在Mystic Avenue中找不到的塞勒姆街走廊区是新事物，这就是多单元住宅的想法。
 这将添加到使用桌法规中，因此您会看到黄色的经历，您会注意到，当我们经历很多事情时，多单元住宅中不允许商业用途。
 您还会看到这种明亮的绿松石突出显示，这就是我们所拥有的。
 MX的地区是商业广告的MX。
 这些也是在神秘大道（Mystic Avenue）中发现的地区，它们的相似之处很强，但是在塞勒姆街区（Salem Street Quarter），如果您看到绿松石，这意味着我们已经从Mystic Avenue更改了它，所以这与Mystic Avenue不同。
 在这种情况下，我们所做的是，我们删除了一些可能适合神秘的商业商业用途，尤其是工业用途，但绝对不适合塞勒姆街，这是对既有使用本身的认可，又是对神秘途径的规模的认可。
 与塞勒姆街（Salem Street）相比，与塞勒姆街（Salem Street）相比，我们要做的就是允许那些增强邻里特征的事情。
 因此，我将滚动浏览此内容。
 但是，当我们进入与机动车相关的用途时，您会特别看到这些区域中缺少这些用途的工业用途。
 关于停车的东西还有一些紫色的东西，这只是提醒我们，当我们回到该地区时，请再次看一下。
 因此，我们正在添加尺寸标准，您再次看到，尽管我们在神秘大道上有混合的两个和一个广告，但宫殿已经描述的其他高度最大程度与众不同。
 同样，我们在此处添加了混合混合的多单元住宅。
 您会看到我们将这些挫折和要求更改为适当。
 我们添加了，我们正在为主动正面的活动正面添加一个定义，并在其中添加了孵化的业务。
 因此，这就是分区条例其他部分的一般变化。
 当我们进入塞勒姆街走廊区本身时，您会发现该格式与神秘大道走廊的格式非常相似，但是目的，适用性，这些组件是不同的。
 因此，您再次看到黄色文字，这是一个新组件。
 我们已经更改了前挫折所需的人行道大小。
 我们将正面更改为更适合可能向后流到Mystic Avenue的塞勒姆街发生的事情。
 我们添加了一些高度豁免，但同样，这些豁免并不适用于诸如Chimneys通风塔之类的某些东西，这与您所拥有的一致。
 或需要特别许可证。
 这允许某些不符合最低高度要求的东西。
 所以这是一个变化。
 我确实想花一些时间在激励上。
 保罗提到有人可以申请更高的高度以换取公共利益的想法。
 我们已经定义了许多激励措施，您也会看到其中的一些激励措施。
 我们已经工作了一些重新设计，它们是如何应用但更深入的负担能力，这意味着，不超过80％的地区收入，能够以65％的地区中位收入或更实惠的单位提供单位是开发商和城市的选择。
 我们有私人维护的社区便利设施。
 Paola提到，我们正在将公共停车场添加到该列表中，但是我们也有室外空间，室内公共场所，我们正在研究市议会要求我们的低收入共享社区太阳能。
 因此，公共停车场和社区太阳能仍然有待确认，因为我们正在研究如何做到这一点，但我们想介绍这个想法。
 社区，因此，这些便利设施中的任何一个设施都将由开发商提供，并由开发商或后来的所有者社区设施维护，由开发实体支付，但由城市维护，这将是街景改进。
 当我们想到改善街道景观时，我们认为的主要是树木和街道树木，以提供阴影和空气质量改进或街道家具，例如长凳，垃圾插座等。
 在这里，我们不是在谈论重新配置街道本身。
