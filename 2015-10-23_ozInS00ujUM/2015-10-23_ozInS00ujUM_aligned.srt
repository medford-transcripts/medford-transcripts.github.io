1
00:00:01,802 --> 00:00:22,407
A bird knows you're true Then a little voice inside you whispers Kid, don't sell your dreams so soon

2
00:00:25,958 --> 00:00:52,759
Everywhere you look, everywhere you go There's a heart, there's a heart, a hand to hold on to Everywhere you look, everywhere you face Somebody who needs you Everywhere you look When you're lost out there and you're all alone Life is waiting to carry you home Everywhere you look

3
00:00:54,768 --> 00:00:54,851
you

4
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:07,842
Here at the 8th grade open house and I'm here with Erica, the captain of the girls gymnastics team.

5
00:01:08,182 --> 00:01:09,423
Erica, how did last season go?

6
00:01:10,023 --> 00:01:10,923
Last season went well.

7
00:01:11,123 --> 00:01:14,885
We were able to win the GBL title and we worked together great as a team.

8
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:17,206
How do you feel about this upcoming season?

9
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:18,266
I'm excited.

10
00:01:18,306 --> 00:01:22,828
We have the freshmen coming in who haven't done the gymnastics before so we're excited about that.

11
00:01:23,348 --> 00:01:26,130
Hi, I'm Hallie Farrell and I'm here with Mike McLaughlin.

12
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,291
What contributions do you make to Medford High School?

13
00:01:30,183 --> 00:01:41,868
Well, I'm the main office secretary and every day me and Lisa Bowler help run the high school alongside Dr. Prella and make sure that everything goes effortlessly and flawlessly for all our lovely students.

14
00:01:42,308 --> 00:01:50,631
We're back again with the Mustang Report and I'm here with Abby McCarthy, Rhiannon Arnold, and Destiny Fitzgerald, three juniors who participate in the Medford High School varsity basketball team.

15
00:01:51,151 --> 00:01:55,473
Abby, what are you doing specifically to train your body and your mind for the upcoming season?

16
00:01:56,114 --> 00:02:04,162
Well currently right now we have our fall ball going on and in like a little bit closer to the season we'll be starting up open gyms so that kind of thing so yeah.

17
00:02:04,863 --> 00:02:18,577
Now you guys are some of the kind of like the major contributors to the Varsity basketball team you know what you know what made you again kind of see basketball as something that you could do you know further on in your high school career?

18
00:02:19,152 --> 00:02:21,374
Well, we all really love the sport a lot, which I think helps.

19
00:02:21,394 --> 00:02:22,614
We have a really passionate team.

20
00:02:23,135 --> 00:02:27,518
So yeah, it's really just nice to be in a group of people who all love what you love to do, and it's a lot of fun.

21
00:02:28,699 --> 00:02:31,741
Basically, to the incoming freshmen, what is the voice of Medford High?

22
00:02:32,281 --> 00:02:36,124
So the voice of Medford High, we get the opportunity to do the announcements every morning.

23
00:02:36,564 --> 00:02:40,107
So I go one day, George goes the next, and yeah, it's super fun.

24
00:02:41,483 --> 00:02:51,991
Yeah, so basically what we do is every other day we flip off and we just have a set of announcements and we let people know what clubs are going on, any big activities that are going on in MHS, and anything else interesting.

25
00:02:52,011 --> 00:02:53,291
Maybe fun facts, who knows?

26
00:02:53,351 --> 00:02:55,073
We just let the people know what they want to hear.

27
00:02:55,093 --> 00:02:58,255
Hi, I'm Hallie Farrell and I'm here with freshman Carmen Diorio.

28
00:02:58,555 --> 00:03:00,997
What sports are you planning on playing for the high school?

29
00:03:01,757 --> 00:03:06,041
Right now I play soccer and I'm planning on playing basketball and softball.

30
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:10,224
What's any piece of advice that you have for the 8th graders that are coming to high school next year?

31
00:03:11,144 --> 00:03:16,347
One thing I've learned is that the school's not as confusing to get around as you think it is.

32
00:03:16,367 --> 00:03:18,948
The eighth graders don't know what school to go to.

33
00:03:19,089 --> 00:03:19,969
What would Tucci do?

34
00:03:20,649 --> 00:03:22,310
What would Tucci do is a no-brainer.

35
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:23,591
You go to Medford High School.

36
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:25,052
I look forward to seeing you in September.

37
00:03:42,368 --> 00:03:59,179
I'll help you with that.

38
00:04:14,885 --> 00:04:39,254
Out of here, we're out of here Out of heart, we're long within They're going to fear again They're going to fear

39
00:04:48,277 --> 00:04:51,961
And gods betray us, out of fear And life goes past, to kill some evil dead ghost

40
00:05:08,313 --> 00:05:13,917
I'm here with the Mustang Report, and I'm here with the four captains of the varsity soccer team.

41
00:05:14,057 --> 00:05:18,240
Can you guys give us a little bit of reflection on how the season has been going so far?

42
00:05:18,941 --> 00:05:20,122
We've been doing really great.

43
00:05:20,642 --> 00:05:27,147
We've only lost one game so far, and I think we're going to do great in the future.

44
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:29,889
I'll move over here.

45
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:35,914
What are you guys doing each week in practices to prepare your body and your mind for upcoming games?

46
00:05:36,494 --> 00:05:45,061
Well, we obviously do a lot of conditioning because it's soccer, so we do a lot of running, we do a lot of game situations, offense versus defense, and we just practice free kicks, corner kicks, everything.

47
00:05:45,501 --> 00:05:54,928
We're back with the Mustang Report, and I'm here with Mike Senner, who's one of the captains of the Medford High School varsity baseball team, and I'm also here with Mike Nestor, who's the coach of that varsity baseball team.

48
00:05:55,449 --> 00:05:58,091
Mike, what are you doing to prepare your body for the upcoming season?

49
00:05:58,711 --> 00:06:07,334
So two or three times a week we actually have workouts in the workout room where we basically lift and then on the weekends we do conditioning for running.

50
00:06:08,754 --> 00:06:17,717
Mr. Mike Nestor, what have you been preaching to the players about getting their bodies ready and getting their minds ready for the upcoming season?

51
00:06:18,398 --> 00:06:19,779
Just that the season never ends.

52
00:06:19,859 --> 00:06:26,962
It's a 12-month season that you can't just show up in March and start swinging a baseball bat and throwing a baseball.

53
00:06:27,102 --> 00:06:31,064
You know, we work out year-long just to get ready for the season, especially up here in the Northeast.

54
00:06:32,185 --> 00:06:34,706
Well, I certainly wish you guys luck on your upcoming season.

55
00:06:34,986 --> 00:06:37,448
And this has been Nick Hennison, again, from the Mustang Report.

56
00:06:37,728 --> 00:06:38,048
Back to you.

57
00:07:32,235 --> 00:07:37,796
Hello, this is Nick Canniston from the Mustang Report with some insight on the Medford High School football season.

58
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:45,237
And I'm here with Mustang Report staff member Eric Rapucci, who is also the Medford High football team manager.

59
00:07:45,897 --> 00:07:48,398
What are some of your responsibilities as team manager?

60
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:58,008
So my responsibilities as team manager is to, at practice, I'm there with a schedule, a time clock, and anything they really need me to do.

61
00:07:58,088 --> 00:08:02,051
So if someone's gear goes haywire, I'm the one to fix it.

62
00:08:02,612 --> 00:08:07,176
And when I'm at games, I'm always on the sideline trying to keep them back, keep them in order.

63
00:08:07,736 --> 00:08:09,658
If anyone needs help, I'm always there to help them.

64
00:08:11,302 --> 00:08:13,883
I think, indeed, that is a very important responsibility.

65
00:08:14,524 --> 00:08:21,207
There have been some pretty close and hard-fought games, specifically the home opener against Beaumont, with the team lost on the final play.

66
00:08:21,847 --> 00:08:27,590
What do you think you have seen and what do you think the team can do better to preserve leads late in the game?

67
00:08:28,765 --> 00:08:33,326
Definitely one of our biggest issues is we don't stay focused when we come out of the second half.

68
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:35,646
We keep the fire in the first half.

69
00:08:35,706 --> 00:08:36,507
We're all amped up.

70
00:08:36,527 --> 00:08:37,187
We're getting ready.

71
00:08:37,607 --> 00:08:39,847
Then we come out in the second half, and everyone just loses it.

72
00:08:39,867 --> 00:08:40,667
No focus.

73
00:08:41,148 --> 00:08:42,148
That was a really tough game.

74
00:08:42,168 --> 00:08:44,368
It definitely hit us straight to the heart.

75
00:08:44,408 --> 00:08:46,449
Definitely another issue we have is tackling.

76
00:08:46,869 --> 00:08:47,849
That's our big thing.

77
00:08:47,889 --> 00:08:49,729
We are on tackle and missing tackles.

78
00:08:50,149 --> 00:08:52,550
And that's what's definitely one of our biggest issues.

79
00:09:10,763 --> 00:09:10,803
No.

80
00:09:59,508 --> 00:10:05,489
How long have you two kind of known each other and what like created this kind of interesting relationship that you guys have?

81
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:11,891
Well, you know, I've known the gentleman next to me for a few years now.

82
00:10:13,471 --> 00:10:20,033
Once I found out that he went to Bowdoin College, the rivalry just immediately started right there.

83
00:10:20,153 --> 00:10:25,274
I mean, you know, Bowdoin College is, it's enough said.

84
00:10:25,354 --> 00:10:26,834
I don't even know where to go with that.

85
00:10:27,155 --> 00:10:28,895
But that's when it started pretty much.

86
00:10:29,404 --> 00:10:38,628
For those of you who don't know, Nassim Eto'o is an alumni of the Tufts University Jumbo, so that's why voting in Tufts is kind of a little bit of a rivalry.

87
00:10:38,748 --> 00:10:44,710
What is your role with these guys, getting them prepared, not only just for the games, but also for basically life?

88
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:53,534
Well, first I would like to say that up until last year's faculty flag football game, I never lost to Mr. Nassimano.

89
00:10:53,574 --> 00:10:58,416
We played in college and I beat him twice, so I would just like to make sure everyone understands that.

90
00:10:58,456 --> 00:11:04,979
Last year was really humiliating for me, but he bent the rules and found a way to cheat as much as possible.

91
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,322
We won't go into any more detail about that.

92
00:11:09,162 --> 00:11:31,402
But in terms of the football players and just the youth of Medford, I think it's very important that we as a community, as a school, find ways to help every kid reach their full potential and teach them the work ethic that I think myself and Coach Nascimento have tried to display for them as much as possible with football and education as part of it.

93
00:11:32,413 --> 00:11:56,150
uh... if you guys just kind of share a little bit of inside on the upcoming flag football teams on you know kind of what the format is like how what are the words of the rules because you know five football with faculty it's kind of a bunch of adults who don't really know a bunch of a lot of them don't really know football so what are some of the things that you guys should do that to kind of facilitate you know a better an easier environment nick it's a great question uh...

94
00:11:58,371 --> 00:12:00,053
There were lots of complaints about the rules.

95
00:12:00,173 --> 00:12:00,653
Figure it out.

96
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:01,534
Figure it out.

97
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,315
We had meetings.

98
00:12:02,635 --> 00:12:04,097
We announced it before the games.

99
00:12:04,117 --> 00:12:05,138
There's no legal practices.

100
00:12:05,819 --> 00:12:07,320
There's no legal practices.

101
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,061
Just listen.

102
00:12:08,281 --> 00:12:09,522
Blue team, figure it out.

103
00:12:09,623 --> 00:12:09,963
That's all.

104
00:12:10,003 --> 00:12:10,764
Just know the rules.

105
00:12:10,884 --> 00:12:11,244
That's all.

106
00:12:12,806 --> 00:12:15,869
But hey, it's going to be an exciting game as it was last year.

107
00:12:15,889 --> 00:12:17,671
I think it's going to be a lot of fun for everyone.

108
00:12:18,211 --> 00:12:19,352
And I'm looking forward to it.

109
00:12:19,513 --> 00:12:20,414
Team Gray all the way.

110
00:12:21,314 --> 00:12:27,958
I would just like to reiterate that there needs to be a play clock this year so he can't sit in the huddle and wind down the whole clock.

111
00:12:28,738 --> 00:12:41,165
I would also like to reiterate the fact that his team had practices while you know my team was full of coaches who were actually doing other things in the building so his team was just kind of hanging out finding ways

112
00:12:41,825 --> 00:12:42,886
to sneak around.

113
00:12:43,306 --> 00:12:47,428
He actually skipped football practice multiple times to attend those practices.

114
00:12:47,468 --> 00:12:53,992
So I would like to say while he was finding ways to beat me in flag football, I was worrying about the actual football team.

115
00:12:54,957 --> 00:13:12,925
false these are all false accusations I mean it's it's such it's so ridiculous but uh you know I'm not here to make excuses okay I'm not gonna talk about the last year last year's game anymore I'm on to this year and and we're gonna focus on what we need to do it's that simple

116
00:13:13,825 --> 00:13:41,365
uh... you know if i if i were to say something to any of the eighties or even high school is watching this if you don't like football fine you know personally i love football so this is only that i enjoy doing even for those of you don't like football i was still recommend coming to this is a great event you know you know that that benefits eric rizali who was a former graduate of medford high school was in a tragic accident

117
00:13:42,126 --> 00:13:46,971
You know, so it funds, you know, a scholarship in his name.

118
00:13:47,312 --> 00:13:52,397
So it's definitely a great cause and it's a lot of fun seeing, you know, a lot of the teachers kind of go at it.

119
00:13:53,418 --> 00:13:57,843
This has been Nick Hennison with Mr. Nacimento and Mr. Jaworski from the Mustang Report.

120
00:13:58,083 --> 00:13:58,544
Back to you.
