    <p>[6cAOF0W2Btw_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozInS00ujUM&t=308.313s">I'm</a>  here with the Mustang Report, and I'm here with the four captains of the varsity soccer team. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozInS00ujUM&t=314.057s">Can</a>  you guys give us a little bit of reflection on how the season has been going so far?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozInS00ujUM&t=318.941s">We've</a>  been doing really great. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozInS00ujUM&t=320.642s">We've</a>  only lost one game so far, and I think we're going to do great in the future.</p>

    <p>[6cAOF0W2Btw_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozInS00ujUM&t=327.167s">I'll</a>  move over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozInS00ujUM&t=330.63s">What</a>  are you guys doing each week in practices to prepare your body and your mind for upcoming games?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozInS00ujUM&t=336.494s">Well,</a>  we obviously do a lot of conditioning because it's soccer, so we do a lot of running, we do a lot of game situations, offense versus defense, and we just practice free kicks, corner kicks, everything.</p>

    <p>[6cAOF0W2Btw_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozInS00ujUM&t=345.501s">We're</a>  back with the Mustang Report, and I'm here with Mike Senner, who's one of the captains of the Medford High School varsity baseball team, and I'm also here with Mike Nestor, who's the coach of that varsity baseball team. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozInS00ujUM&t=355.449s">Mike,</a>  what are you doing to prepare your body for the upcoming season?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozInS00ujUM&t=358.711s">So</a>  two or three times a week we actually have workouts in the workout room where we basically lift and then on the weekends we do conditioning for running.</p>

    <p>[6cAOF0W2Btw_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozInS00ujUM&t=368.754s">Mr.</a>  Mike Nestor, what have you been preaching to the players about getting their bodies ready and getting their minds ready for the upcoming season?</p>

    <p>[Kelly Mead]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozInS00ujUM&t=378.398s">Just</a>  that the season never ends. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozInS00ujUM&t=379.859s">It's</a>  a 12-month season that you can't just show up in March and start swinging a baseball bat and throwing a baseball. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozInS00ujUM&t=387.102s">You</a>  know, we work out year-long just to get ready for the season, especially up here in the Northeast.</p>

    <p>[6cAOF0W2Btw_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozInS00ujUM&t=392.185s">Well,</a>  I certainly wish you guys luck on your upcoming season. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozInS00ujUM&t=394.986s">And</a>  this has been Nick Hennison, again, from the Mustang Report. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozInS00ujUM&t=397.728s">Back</a>  to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozInS00ujUM&t=452.235s">Hello,</a>  this is Nick Canniston from the Mustang Report with some insight on the Medford High School football season. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozInS00ujUM&t=458.416s">And</a>  I'm here with Mustang Report staff member Eric Rapucci, who is also the Medford High football team manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozInS00ujUM&t=465.897s">What</a>  are some of your responsibilities as team manager?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozInS00ujUM&t=469.32s">So</a>  my responsibilities as team manager is to, at practice, I'm there with a schedule, a time clock, and anything they really need me to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozInS00ujUM&t=478.088s">So</a>  if someone's gear goes haywire, I'm the one to fix it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozInS00ujUM&t=482.612s">And</a>  when I'm at games, I'm always on the sideline trying to keep them back, keep them in order. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozInS00ujUM&t=487.736s">If</a>  anyone needs help, I'm always there to help them.</p>

    <p>[6cAOF0W2Btw_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozInS00ujUM&t=491.302s">I</a>  think, indeed, that is a very important responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozInS00ujUM&t=494.524s">There</a>  have been some pretty close and hard-fought games, specifically the home opener against Beaumont, with the team lost on the final play. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozInS00ujUM&t=501.847s">What</a>  do you think you have seen and what do you think the team can do better to preserve leads late in the game?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozInS00ujUM&t=508.765s">Definitely</a>  one of our biggest issues is we don't stay focused when we come out of the second half. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozInS00ujUM&t=513.946s">We</a>  keep the fire in the first half. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozInS00ujUM&t=515.706s">We're</a>  all amped up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozInS00ujUM&t=516.527s">We're</a>  getting ready. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozInS00ujUM&t=517.607s">Then</a>  we come out in the second half, and everyone just loses it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozInS00ujUM&t=519.867s">No</a>  focus. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozInS00ujUM&t=521.148s">That</a>  was a really tough game. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozInS00ujUM&t=522.168s">It</a>  definitely hit us straight to the heart. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozInS00ujUM&t=524.408s">Definitely</a>  another issue we have is tackling. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozInS00ujUM&t=526.869s">That's</a>  our big thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozInS00ujUM&t=527.889s">We</a>  are on tackle and missing tackles. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozInS00ujUM&t=530.149s">And</a>  that's what's definitely one of our biggest issues.</p>

    <p>[6cAOF0W2Btw_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozInS00ujUM&t=599.508s">How</a>  long have you two kind of known each other and what like created this kind of interesting relationship that you guys have?</p>

    <p>[Jason Nascimento]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozInS00ujUM&t=607.11s">Well,</a>  you know, I've known the gentleman next to me for a few years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozInS00ujUM&t=613.471s">Once</a>  I found out that he went to Bowdoin College, the rivalry just immediately started right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozInS00ujUM&t=620.153s">I</a>  mean, you know, Bowdoin College is, it's enough said. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozInS00ujUM&t=625.354s">I</a>  don't even know where to go with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozInS00ujUM&t=627.155s">But</a>  that's when it started pretty much.</p>

    <p>[6cAOF0W2Btw_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ozInS00ujUM&t=629.404s">For</a>  those of you who don't know, Nassim Eto'o is an alumni of the Tufts University Jumbo, so that's why voting in Tufts is kind of a little bit of a rivalry. <a href="https://youtu.be/ozInS00ujUM&t=638.748s">What</a>  is your role with these guys, getting them prepared, not only just for the games, but also for basically life?</p>
