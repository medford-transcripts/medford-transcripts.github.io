00:00:31,287 --> 00:00:36,308
Hello, everyone, and welcome to your show, Method Happenings.

2
00:00:37,568 --> 00:00:40,729
We're going to do a show tonight, and it's going to be a short one.

3
00:00:41,469 --> 00:00:58,613
You know, we just want to take some time, and we've got a lot of people to thank, people I've, you know, been associated with putting together Method Happenings, all the guests, and we've had a lot of people along the way that have helped out.

4
00:01:00,336 --> 00:01:04,157
I also want to say, you know, there's a lot going on in the world.

5
00:01:05,678 --> 00:01:14,020
You know, there's still a lot of good stuff, but there's an awful lot of sad things going on, you know, during the holiday season.

6
00:01:14,901 --> 00:01:21,903
I just wanted to say a little favorite saying of mine, and I think people need to keep this in mind.

7
00:01:23,623 --> 00:01:26,484
Where there is faith, there is love.

8
00:01:27,422 --> 00:01:31,003
And where there is love, there is peace.

9
00:01:32,664 --> 00:01:36,465
Where there is peace, there is God.

10
00:01:37,685 --> 00:01:42,127
And where God is, nothing is missing.

11
00:01:42,787 --> 00:01:43,167
Amen.

12
00:01:44,127 --> 00:01:46,068
So I just had to get that in there.

13
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:52,503
And I hope you heard it and I wish everybody peace.

14
00:01:53,944 --> 00:01:55,145
So we're gonna begin.

15
00:01:55,165 --> 00:01:58,687
I wanna start thanking some people who have been on the show.

16
00:02:00,048 --> 00:02:03,730
Like I said, there's an awful lot of them.

17
00:02:04,631 --> 00:02:10,134
And I wanna also say that, we started this with very little.

18
00:02:11,275 --> 00:02:14,437
It was just an idea from one person

19
00:02:15,835 --> 00:02:24,938
I got involved, and then we brought on two great guys that joined us, and you'll hear from all of them.

20
00:02:25,738 --> 00:02:32,060
But I got to tell you, the show, it's just been an incredible year.

21
00:02:32,521 --> 00:02:34,681
We've put about 31 shows out.

22
00:02:35,942 --> 00:02:40,123
We've had four or five what we call shorts, 15, 20-minute shows.

23
00:02:41,103 --> 00:02:42,364
We've had business owners.

24
00:02:44,145 --> 00:02:49,887
A lot of the candidates that ran this year came on, told us what they were all about.

25
00:02:49,907 --> 00:02:51,588
A lot of them were the new candidates.

26
00:02:52,548 --> 00:02:54,849
But we really did have a lot of fun.

27
00:02:56,609 --> 00:03:03,611
And our main goal was to get information out to everyone that lives in this city.

28
00:03:04,252 --> 00:03:06,172
And not just any information.

29
00:03:06,232 --> 00:03:09,653
You know, information that's valuable, that you can use.

30
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:16,379
You know, that's going to inform you about what's really going on in Medford.

31
00:03:17,161 --> 00:03:18,383
There's been a lot of good.

32
00:03:18,404 --> 00:03:20,247
There's been, you know, negative

33
00:03:21,657 --> 00:03:23,457
There's, I mean, I can go on and on.

34
00:03:23,477 --> 00:03:26,158
Now we're dealing with a trash situation.

35
00:03:27,118 --> 00:03:31,139
We're still going on with, it's just so many things.

36
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:34,940
The zoning, you know, there really is a lot.

37
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:40,861
We all see all the buildings that are gonna be going up, a lot of apartment buildings going up.

38
00:03:42,261 --> 00:03:47,702
That, you know, some people think it's a great thing and others may not, but it's happening.

39
00:03:47,782 --> 00:03:49,443
So there's a lot going on.

40
00:03:51,004 --> 00:03:56,366
And we just want to continue doing what we're doing, and that's to keep everybody informed.

41
00:03:58,287 --> 00:04:03,449
So the first guy I really got to thank, and that's really the leader.

42
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,650
He's the one who started this.

43
00:04:06,431 --> 00:04:08,151
And that's Paul Geraghty.

44
00:04:08,912 --> 00:04:17,715
He's better known to us as the general, or lovingly known as the general.

45
00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:25,271
Paul is really the person responsible for the idea that got this all started.

46
00:04:26,071 --> 00:04:32,112
And it's been a pleasure meeting him, working with him.

47
00:04:33,913 --> 00:04:38,134
And he's behind the scenes, but boy, he does a lot of good.

48
00:04:38,894 --> 00:04:42,455
And he does a lot of good for the city of Method, and he cares about Method.

49
00:04:42,495 --> 00:04:44,576
So I want to thank you, Paul.

50
00:04:44,656 --> 00:04:45,056
It has.

51
00:04:45,116 --> 00:04:45,976
It's been a pleasure.

52
00:04:49,908 --> 00:04:51,289
I've enjoyed working with you.

53
00:04:52,089 --> 00:04:54,770
I also want to thank Bruce Patterson.

54
00:04:56,471 --> 00:04:59,032
I mean, he's just like, you know, the wizard, I guess.

55
00:04:59,572 --> 00:05:02,934
Technical, and it's amazing what he's done with our website.

56
00:05:02,954 --> 00:05:06,335
You know, he joined us along the way.

57
00:05:06,355 --> 00:05:13,158
And I also want to thank Marco Cronali, who, boy, he's helped out tremendously.

58
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:18,020
And I want to remind everyone that, you know, this is a show that we do.

59
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,541
You know, we're not paid.

60
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:26,184
We don't, you know, we're not getting rich doing this.

61
00:05:26,224 --> 00:05:28,085
We're doing it because we love the city.

62
00:05:30,127 --> 00:05:31,628
You know, and we really do.

63
00:05:31,888 --> 00:05:33,189
We enjoy doing the show.

64
00:05:33,289 --> 00:05:35,470
And I tell you, it's a great group of guys.

65
00:05:37,692 --> 00:05:40,093
So I just had to get that all in.

66
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:46,838
Marco, Paul Geraghty, and Bruce Patterson.

67
00:05:47,899 --> 00:05:49,760
And I tell you, we've all worked hard

68
00:05:50,854 --> 00:05:58,640
putting out 31 shows, and we did some shots and all the rest of it that you do in between.

69
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:03,784
The things that it takes to put a show together, it's a lot.

70
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:09,869
But like I say, we do enjoy it, and we've had a lot of fun.

71
00:06:10,349 --> 00:06:18,075
You know, I also wanna thank, you know, the Method Community Media, which is the public education,

72
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:25,133
and Government Access Television Media Studio, which serves Medford.

73
00:06:25,954 --> 00:06:27,835
So I wanna thank Kevin Harrington.

74
00:06:28,435 --> 00:06:30,136
He's running the studio.

75
00:06:30,196 --> 00:06:31,317
He does a great job.

76
00:06:32,317 --> 00:06:35,479
And I also wanna thank James Corbett.

77
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,181
That's his assistant extraordinaire, we call him.

78
00:06:40,662 --> 00:06:46,385
And a shout out to a few other people, Jonathan, Stevie B, that also have helped up

79
00:06:46,762 --> 00:06:54,266
helped out along the way working with cameras and, you know, we'd be short a person and boy, they'd come through for us.

80
00:06:54,286 --> 00:06:55,367
So thank you guys.

81
00:06:55,787 --> 00:07:04,271
And there's a few others, quite a few, I'm not gonna mention them, but thank you for helping us out on short notice.

82
00:07:05,412 --> 00:07:13,556
So I wanna stress that we are gonna be taking some time off for the Christmas season and New Year's.

83
00:07:16,617 --> 00:07:19,918
You know, we've done a lot and we do need a break.

84
00:07:20,918 --> 00:07:25,179
And I think we've all, you know, Paul, Marco, and Bruce would agree with me.

85
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,881
We really do, we need a break.

86
00:07:28,941 --> 00:07:35,682
So over the next few weeks, this is gonna be our last show until the new year.

87
00:07:35,702 --> 00:07:38,603
So it's been a long year.

88
00:07:46,076 --> 00:07:49,918
So enjoyable, as I said earlier.

89
00:07:50,779 --> 00:07:57,743
But we're gonna take a break and then I guess we plan on hitting the new year really hard.

90
00:07:58,283 --> 00:07:59,884
We got a lot of things planned.

91
00:08:00,844 --> 00:08:02,585
We got a lot of things happening.

92
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:12,891
So in the upcoming season, I want everyone to know, we are, we're planning some really good shows, exciting shows.

93
00:08:13,631 --> 00:08:15,152
Even though we're taking a break,

94
00:08:15,858 --> 00:08:20,802
We're still working on things for the upcoming season.

95
00:08:22,984 --> 00:08:28,468
We're gonna have a lot of, I consider really wonderful guests.

96
00:08:29,369 --> 00:08:31,350
We got a lot of exciting new features.

97
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:36,454
I know Bruce is doing a new look for the website.

98
00:08:37,075 --> 00:08:39,937
I love the website he's already put up.

99
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:44,698
it's getting a ton of views.

100
00:08:44,938 --> 00:08:58,027
I'm going to say this, I believe the show, the website, I think we had a total of like 14,000 views, which to me, if you told me a year ago,

101
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:07,706
you know, doing this show that we were going to get that kind of views, I would have never believed you.

102
00:09:08,526 --> 00:09:10,988
So it makes us feel good.

103
00:09:11,608 --> 00:09:13,110
I mean, that's what it's all about.

104
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:17,813
And it looks like our hard work is really paying off.

105
00:09:18,494 --> 00:09:23,057
And I want you to know, you know, we're going to keep covering everything we can in Method.

106
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:31,486
You know, the good, the bad, and I guess I call it the not so pretty stuff, because there's some of that too.

107
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:35,970
I'm sure we're going to get into some of those things.

108
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:40,654
There is a lot going on with the city.

109
00:09:41,674 --> 00:09:50,962
And I also want to make a point that, you know, we have invited Madame Mayor to join us on the show.

110
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:53,551
So we'll see if we can get her to come on.

111
00:09:53,591 --> 00:09:56,433
I think that would be wonderful to have her join us.

112
00:09:57,253 --> 00:10:07,779
We've also sent out invites to the entire council, the city council, and we're hoping that they will be joining us on the show.

113
00:10:09,099 --> 00:10:11,141
I think they'd make for great shows.

114
00:10:11,521 --> 00:10:14,602
And maybe we'll try the school committee as well, you know?

115
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:19,185
And I, you know, I want you to know we also got, we've got some

116
00:10:20,232 --> 00:10:22,993
There's a lot of business activity going on in Method.

117
00:10:23,053 --> 00:10:31,517
So, you know, a lot of restaurants we plan on doing some shows with, small business.

118
00:10:31,677 --> 00:10:33,558
You know, we had Method Soap on.

119
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:42,982
We also, the Rotary Club, and we plan on having, there's a lot of good organizations.

120
00:10:43,723 --> 00:10:45,924
And I'm telling you, they do really good work.

121
00:10:46,024 --> 00:10:48,525
And I don't think they're, I don't think

122
00:10:49,087 --> 00:10:56,113
a lot of people in Method are aware of all the things that go on, all the good things that happen, you know?

123
00:10:56,493 --> 00:11:12,666
I mean, this Christmas, it's been, you know, the city has really come together, the fire department, Toys for Tots, and there's been so many, so many programs helping, you know, people helping people, and that's what it's all about.

124
00:11:12,886 --> 00:11:13,606
It really is.

125
00:11:15,868 --> 00:11:17,890
So, you know, that's what we got,

126
00:11:18,621 --> 00:11:20,342
I'm looking forward to the new year.

127
00:11:20,422 --> 00:11:23,024
I know Paul, Bruce, and Marco.

128
00:11:23,764 --> 00:11:30,228
And what we're trying to do, I'm gonna put it out there, is we're trying to get a few more people to join us.

129
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:32,249
We can use some help.

130
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:40,114
Geez, I think it's quite a bit, there was quite a bit of work involved.

131
00:11:40,154 --> 00:11:45,837
I know there was weeks we were doing like, you know, 50 hours a week dedicated to,

132
00:11:47,004 --> 00:11:49,545
keeping everything going, keeping it all together.

133
00:11:51,265 --> 00:11:55,147
So we're going to be looking for some help.

134
00:11:55,187 --> 00:11:58,368
Hopefully we'll get some more people to join us.

135
00:11:59,248 --> 00:12:03,109
And like I said, it's all volunteer.

136
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:06,951
So any kind of help would be appreciated.

137
00:12:07,591 --> 00:12:14,573
So from all of us at Method Happenings, I want to thank Method.

138
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:20,138
I think we've been a benefit to the city of Medford, to the people.

139
00:12:20,578 --> 00:12:29,064
And that was our original goal, just to be able to get information out.

140
00:12:29,484 --> 00:12:34,828
One of the other people, I don't know how I forgot to mention them, but got to know Medford.

141
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:43,053
Another group, three wonderful women that are doing a great job.

142
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:48,491
with the, I guess you'd call it a newspaper.

143
00:12:49,071 --> 00:12:52,252
It's not a print newspaper, but it's online.

144
00:12:52,932 --> 00:12:57,233
If you haven't checked it out, we've had them on the show twice.

145
00:12:57,933 --> 00:13:05,555
And I tell you that the shows, both shows we did with them did very, very well as far as people viewing.

146
00:13:05,575 --> 00:13:05,615
So,

147
00:13:08,838 --> 00:13:11,839
Just so you know, we plan on having them back.

148
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:17,801
We're trying to work something out with them, maybe on a regular basis, to focus on certain issues.

149
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:23,143
But I want to thank those wonderful ladies.

150
00:13:23,423 --> 00:13:27,465
I want to wish everyone, we all want to wish everyone a Merry Christmas.

151
00:13:29,145 --> 00:13:31,246
Really, happy holidays.

152
00:13:32,006 --> 00:13:35,087
And everyone, just have a joyous new year.

153
00:13:37,479 --> 00:13:39,360
You know, God bless you all.

154
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,941
And I mean that.

155
00:13:42,202 --> 00:13:46,205
We all need to find some peace, slow down a little bit.

156
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:51,908
Enjoy family, friends, neighbors.

157
00:13:52,969 --> 00:13:54,210
It's that time of year.

158
00:13:54,230 --> 00:14:01,795
And it's good to see so much going on with people helping other people.

159
00:14:01,935 --> 00:14:03,696
