1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:10,022
[SPEAKER_01]: So a motion to, or I'm sorry, do we wanna go over, do we wanna accept the minutes first, right?

2
00:00:12,482 --> 00:00:19,384
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, for the October and November meetings, because we weren't able to approve them the last time.

3
00:00:20,804 --> 00:00:30,046
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so motion to accept the meetings of the October and November, the minutes of the October and November meetings.

4
00:00:31,253 --> 00:00:31,393
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

5
00:00:33,234 --> 00:00:33,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

6
00:00:35,515 --> 00:00:36,136
[SPEAKER_01]: Aye, yes.

7
00:00:37,036 --> 00:00:39,077
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, approved.

8
00:00:39,177 --> 00:00:40,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, guys.

9
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:49,883
[SPEAKER_01]: And motion to start the meeting?

10
00:00:50,824 --> 00:00:52,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, we're starting.

11
00:00:52,765 --> 00:00:54,085
[SPEAKER_01]: We're already starting anyway.

12
00:00:55,957 --> 00:00:57,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we, we usually go down.

13
00:00:58,118 --> 00:01:00,300
[SPEAKER_01]: I never, I never will be good at that.

14
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,401
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's okay.

15
00:01:01,581 --> 00:01:04,743
[SPEAKER_02]: We usually just go down through the members to make sure who's here.

16
00:01:04,963 --> 00:01:11,047
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that we have a. We know that we have a quorum, but that's not an official motion or anything.

17
00:01:11,647 --> 00:01:12,108
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

18
00:01:12,688 --> 00:01:12,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

19
00:01:13,168 --> 00:01:14,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

20
00:01:14,609 --> 00:01:17,871
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we want to talk about when we want to have our next meeting?

21
00:01:17,891 --> 00:01:20,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think we're going to have to, like.

22
00:01:22,574 --> 00:01:22,755
[SPEAKER_05]: Like.

23
00:01:24,004 --> 00:01:32,897
[SPEAKER_05]: figure out a time like maybe we can do or I can pass like an email for everyone and see like what you know.

24
00:01:33,947 --> 00:01:36,569
[SPEAKER_05]: put on the doc when you guys are available.

25
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:48,536
[SPEAKER_05]: So that way we can figure out like a time we can just, you know, I know Stacey is going to be not on here for a couple just because of, you know, what she was going through.

26
00:01:48,936 --> 00:01:50,537
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, yeah.

27
00:01:51,157 --> 00:01:55,020
[SPEAKER_05]: So it would be just Natasha, Charbel and I with Samia.

28
00:01:57,061 --> 00:01:57,261
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

29
00:01:57,281 --> 00:02:02,204
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know Samia can't make, uh, can only do Thursdays and Fridays right now.

30
00:02:05,172 --> 00:02:10,758
[SPEAKER_05]: In all honesty, I feel like for me, Thursdays and Fridays are pretty open.

31
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,781
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm open to that.

32
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:14,502
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

33
00:02:16,464 --> 00:02:18,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said, I can do the email.

34
00:02:18,686 --> 00:02:23,311
[SPEAKER_00]: Thursday nights are not good because I do the ESOL class at the library from six.

35
00:02:24,492 --> 00:02:25,974
[SPEAKER_00]: But Friday is okay for me.

36
00:02:28,962 --> 00:02:30,783
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I can do Friday.

37
00:02:30,843 --> 00:02:35,666
[SPEAKER_01]: I would just have to call in from work.

38
00:02:37,467 --> 00:02:46,533
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can't guarantee that I will be like 100% attentive during the meetings, but if need be, I can do that.

39
00:02:50,015 --> 00:02:54,538
[SPEAKER_02]: Does everybody have commitments during the day?

40
00:02:54,598 --> 00:02:58,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Would it make sense for people to hold the meeting

41
00:02:59,303 --> 00:03:03,987
[SPEAKER_02]: During like, you know, night sometime during 9 to 5.

42
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,571
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not for me.

43
00:03:09,451 --> 00:03:10,993
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, Brenda, I have a question.

44
00:03:11,393 --> 00:03:13,415
[SPEAKER_05]: How late can.

45
00:03:14,701 --> 00:03:16,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, this is just a idea, guys.

46
00:03:16,962 --> 00:03:18,943
[SPEAKER_05]: You can let me know if you disagree or not.

47
00:03:18,983 --> 00:03:23,204
[SPEAKER_05]: But I was thinking, we're usually almost always there on Wednesdays, right?

48
00:03:23,725 --> 00:03:28,727
[SPEAKER_05]: So is there a way to stay a little bit later, just for the meeting, Brenda?

49
00:03:28,747 --> 00:03:30,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Or, you know what I mean?

50
00:03:31,048 --> 00:03:36,810
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to like, have it so we're all there physically?

51
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:38,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.

52
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:42,012
[SPEAKER_02]: When do you get when are you done with your other meeting on Wednesdays?

53
00:03:42,835 --> 00:03:50,818
[SPEAKER_05]: We're usually done around I'll tell you right now because sometimes I like 630 I think.

54
00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:54,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me see.

55
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:55,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, 630.

56
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:01,923
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was thinking maybe we can do like, I don't know if you guys want guys.

57
00:04:02,003 --> 00:04:06,425
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, like, I'm just saying taking advantage that we're all there and stuff, you know?

58
00:04:09,987 --> 00:04:12,828
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do it at 7 can do 630 to 7.

59
00:04:13,468 --> 00:04:16,309
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.

60
00:04:17,449 --> 00:04:23,351
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we can just walk across the hall from the meeting to the other side to the other meeting room.

61
00:04:23,431 --> 00:04:27,753
[SPEAKER_05]: If there is, if that's available, or if not the 1 that we went last time, remember Brenda.

62
00:04:27,913 --> 00:04:36,556
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think some something that we might run into is the lack of space at city hall on Wednesday evenings or.

63
00:04:38,472 --> 00:04:45,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, if we're doing it in person, that might become an issue, but let's try to schedule it first and see what we can find.

64
00:04:46,016 --> 00:04:49,257
[SPEAKER_00]: How long will it be?

65
00:04:49,297 --> 00:04:53,680
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it depends on how late.

66
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,582
[SPEAKER_00]: Our meetings are usually, what, two hours or something?

67
00:05:00,183 --> 00:05:01,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, usually an hour and a half.

68
00:05:03,105 --> 00:05:03,525
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

69
00:05:03,565 --> 00:05:05,906
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I might not be able to stay that long.

70
00:05:05,946 --> 00:05:07,366
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of my longest days.

71
00:05:07,466 --> 00:05:09,906
[SPEAKER_00]: I work from, I work two jobs back to back.

72
00:05:09,946 --> 00:05:13,247
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll probably see me veggie veggie.

73
00:05:13,347 --> 00:05:14,067
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, huh?

74
00:05:14,087 --> 00:05:14,587
[SPEAKER_00]: What's my name?

75
00:05:17,768 --> 00:05:23,949
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, I, I could do Wednesday nights, but probably the latest I could stay.

76
00:05:24,029 --> 00:05:27,009
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably eight pushing to eight 30.

77
00:05:27,849 --> 00:05:28,110
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

78
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:30,650
[SPEAKER_02]: But if we start at six 30 and six 30 to eight,

79
00:05:32,614 --> 00:05:33,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Good work, it sounds like.

80
00:05:34,256 --> 00:05:35,497
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.

81
00:05:38,119 --> 00:05:38,899
[SPEAKER_01]: Works for me.

82
00:05:43,363 --> 00:05:53,951
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that way, like, if we can't find a space, I probably, I mean, I know that they wouldn't mind that we use our office anyway, so we can just wait there for Brenda to come.

83
00:05:56,974 --> 00:05:58,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that would be wonderful.

84
00:05:59,042 --> 00:06:07,248
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, do we want to still send an email out to everyone so that folks who aren't here can can get a chance to weigh in on this?

85
00:06:07,349 --> 00:06:15,795
[SPEAKER_02]: But does Wednesday the 19th sound like a good time to start this?

86
00:06:19,218 --> 00:06:20,479
[SPEAKER_01]: March 19th, right?

87
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:21,440
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, March 19th.

88
00:06:23,623 --> 00:06:32,446
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, is that like a set March 19th, you said, is that like a set in stone time?

89
00:06:32,466 --> 00:06:38,768
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I want to check real quick to see like, I don't know if you have a chart bill at hand or not.

90
00:06:38,848 --> 00:06:45,370
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the calendar that we have, like our events and stuff that like they've been pre doing with like the dates and everything.

91
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.

92
00:06:47,131 --> 00:06:49,972
[SPEAKER_05]: Like we were supposed to send it, but I never got it.

93
00:06:51,492 --> 00:06:52,853
[SPEAKER_05]: If you can like forward it to me.

94
00:06:55,073 --> 00:07:04,337
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, she sent a thing of us, Brenda, with like all of our events and things like that.

95
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:08,018
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to make sure that there's nothing on that date, so then we're good to go.

96
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:11,860
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's nothing.

97
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,221
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

98
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:14,401
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just March 30th.

99
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:16,602
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a health and wellness fair.

100
00:07:17,302 --> 00:07:17,963
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, awesome.

101
00:07:18,043 --> 00:07:20,784
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, we're good that day, March 19th.

102
00:07:22,348 --> 00:07:22,848
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.

103
00:07:23,789 --> 00:07:37,018
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll set it up as a hybrid meeting so that it's open to, I mean, it sounds like you'll all be there in person and so will I, but we can set it up as a hybrid meeting so that members of the public, if they want to join, they can.

104
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:45,804
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that Samia sent, she sent a link to this folder.

105
00:07:46,769 --> 00:07:53,431
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Samia, which has the schedule in it, but I will, I'll go ahead and forward that email to you.

106
00:07:54,071 --> 00:07:55,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

107
00:07:55,751 --> 00:07:56,011
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

108
00:07:56,091 --> 00:08:00,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause when I get emails, they get all meshed and then I can't find anything.

109
00:08:00,812 --> 00:08:03,113
[SPEAKER_05]: And then like right when you send it to me, I'm going to pin it.

110
00:08:03,133 --> 00:08:04,353
[SPEAKER_05]: So that way I can have it there.

111
00:08:08,194 --> 00:08:08,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

112
00:08:08,514 --> 00:08:13,395
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll definitely send an email, Brenda or everyone for the council members.

113
00:08:14,596 --> 00:08:15,016
[SPEAKER_05]: Perfect.

114
00:08:15,096 --> 00:08:15,476
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

115
00:08:21,633 --> 00:08:28,835
[SPEAKER_02]: And then once you've confirmed that this works for people and I'll send out a calendar invitation for people.

116
00:08:29,255 --> 00:08:29,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

117
00:08:30,815 --> 00:08:31,175
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

118
00:08:31,315 --> 00:08:37,477
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if you, I mean, like, maybe this Wednesday, I can comment it to, like, Catherine and stuff.

119
00:08:38,757 --> 00:08:43,978
[SPEAKER_05]: To see if, like, even we can use a space just in case if all else fail, we don't have a meeting.

120
00:08:44,698 --> 00:08:45,038
[SPEAKER_05]: Space.

121
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:45,959
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

122
00:08:56,753 --> 00:09:00,375
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have anything else for the administrative topics to you.

123
00:09:14,202 --> 00:09:18,465
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's up next, the Medford Connects events?

124
00:09:19,065 --> 00:09:19,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

125
00:09:26,003 --> 00:09:36,210
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have the, there's the cultural connections to behavioral healthcare summit tomorrow from 12 to 2.30.

126
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:41,953
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be in the, in the chambers in the city.

127
00:09:44,355 --> 00:09:47,057
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's the 17th, which is,

128
00:09:52,063 --> 00:09:55,204
[SPEAKER_01]: That's next Monday, I believe, right?

129
00:09:56,145 --> 00:10:01,907
[SPEAKER_01]: Black History Month event for President's Day, which is also in the chambers.

130
00:10:03,608 --> 00:10:05,908
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the event?

131
00:10:06,229 --> 00:10:07,669
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the Black History Month event?

132
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:17,153
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's just commemorating Black History Month, so I'm not sure exactly what's going on.

133
00:10:19,228 --> 00:10:20,589
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think it's a general thing.

134
00:10:20,749 --> 00:10:28,074
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know that Frances is, she's the one who's like in charge of that.

135
00:10:29,535 --> 00:10:37,361
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're able to come, please come, because me, Darlene, and the Meditation Task Force, we're going to be singing there.

136
00:10:37,381 --> 00:10:42,324
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, good.

137
00:10:42,785 --> 00:10:47,148
[SPEAKER_01]: I will try to, but I don't know if I'll be able to stay too long.

138
00:10:49,165 --> 00:10:49,806
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

139
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:50,946
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

140
00:10:52,087 --> 00:11:02,153
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's the International Mother Tongue Day celebration, February 21, from 2 to 4.30 p.m.

141
00:11:03,574 --> 00:11:05,636
[SPEAKER_01]: in the Medford Public Library.

142
00:11:10,359 --> 00:11:11,940
[SPEAKER_02]: What does that consist of?

143
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:12,340
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know?

144
00:11:14,499 --> 00:11:25,066
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Barakatulo actually gave us, I think he's in charge of that event, obviously, as the ESOL connector.

145
00:11:25,086 --> 00:11:29,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't he give us a paper, Charbel, letting us know what was going on?

146
00:11:30,829 --> 00:11:32,130
[SPEAKER_05]: But what were they doing there?

147
00:11:33,251 --> 00:11:38,634
[SPEAKER_05]: They wanted tables to represent like each of the language and the tongues of everyone.

148
00:11:39,555 --> 00:11:41,496
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that was like the main gist of it.

149
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:43,557
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I think so.

150
00:11:45,580 --> 00:12:15,095
[SPEAKER_05]: find that paper oh my gosh so many but yeah i think it was just that um brenda like you know having a like each one a table like you know talk like about the language and stuff and like what it represents and everything so that's about it for that one yeah

151
00:12:17,298 --> 00:12:18,738
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the next one Sharbo.

152
00:12:19,479 --> 00:12:21,099
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the only one for this month.

153
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:31,402
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's a multicultural night at Misutak school on the February 27th from 5 to 7.

154
00:12:31,582 --> 00:12:35,543
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's at the Misutak.

155
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:42,385
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the Medford Family Network is going to be hosting that.

156
00:12:48,531 --> 00:12:50,933
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I think that's it for February.

157
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:53,995
[SPEAKER_02]: What about March?

158
00:12:54,016 --> 00:12:55,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have that planned already?

159
00:12:56,898 --> 00:13:01,121
[SPEAKER_01]: March, I only have the health and wellness fair for March 30th.

160
00:13:01,982 --> 00:13:05,965
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's nothing there's like it's saying there's two other events.

161
00:13:07,226 --> 00:13:10,169
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know when they will be or what they will be.

162
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:12,831
[SPEAKER_02]: March 30th.

163
00:13:12,891 --> 00:13:13,972
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a Sunday.

164
00:13:14,152 --> 00:13:15,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that is that correct?

165
00:13:16,487 --> 00:13:16,967
[SPEAKER_05]: I think so.

166
00:13:17,167 --> 00:13:17,628
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me see.

167
00:13:17,648 --> 00:13:17,988
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

168
00:13:18,608 --> 00:13:18,968
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

169
00:13:19,248 --> 00:13:19,749
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

170
00:13:20,709 --> 00:13:21,189
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it is.

171
00:13:21,329 --> 00:13:21,550
[SPEAKER_05]: It is.

172
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:23,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Nope.

173
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:24,371
[SPEAKER_05]: March 30th.

174
00:13:24,551 --> 00:13:25,511
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

175
00:13:32,975 --> 00:13:33,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

176
00:13:33,796 --> 00:13:41,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I'm not sure that I'm going to be, um, tabling any of these.

177
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:41,879
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um,

178
00:13:44,492 --> 00:13:52,178
[SPEAKER_02]: If I send you the Electrify Medford flyers, can you just have them there as a resource for people?

179
00:13:52,878 --> 00:13:54,099
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, of course.

180
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,942
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, definitely.

181
00:13:57,202 --> 00:14:03,887
[SPEAKER_01]: I found what will be the objectives of the Mother Tongue Day, if you want to know.

182
00:14:03,907 --> 00:14:04,807
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

183
00:14:05,548 --> 00:14:11,753
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so it's promoting awareness of the importance of linguistic and cultural diversity.

184
00:14:12,728 --> 00:14:21,296
[SPEAKER_01]: highlight the importance of linguistic freedoms and foster a sense of pride in native languages and multilingualism.

185
00:14:22,817 --> 00:14:26,821
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that will be at the Medford Public Library.

186
00:14:28,722 --> 00:14:29,043
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

187
00:14:32,446 --> 00:14:32,666
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

188
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:56,315
[SPEAKER_02]: So in terms of events that I am at right now that's planned, so we had an Electrify Medford event at the library on January 16th, where we had a presentation by Steve Bright from Heat Smart Alliance.

189
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:57,891
[SPEAKER_02]: all about heat pumps.

190
00:14:58,471 --> 00:15:02,333
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just a short half-hour presentation where he was talking about heat pumps.

191
00:15:02,874 --> 00:15:10,999
[SPEAKER_02]: And then people could split up and have a one-on-one conversation with one of our coaches.

192
00:15:11,999 --> 00:15:19,804
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had six people do coaching sessions right there at the event rather than just sign up to do it another time.

193
00:15:20,325 --> 00:15:24,647
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that was pretty effective to actually get people through that.

194
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:35,128
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been having an issue where people have been signing up, but then not following up with scheduling an appointment or actually doing the coaching session.

195
00:15:35,148 --> 00:15:43,072
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we've only had about 30% of the people who've signed up actually go through with a coaching session.

196
00:15:43,952 --> 00:15:50,355
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think events like that, where we can do the coaching session right there is really helpful.

197
00:15:50,395 --> 00:15:56,097
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to do more of those and do less just tabling sessions in general.

198
00:15:59,086 --> 00:16:07,671
[SPEAKER_02]: So, our next 1 of those that we had scheduled is, um, will be at the senior center on March 4th for an info session.

199
00:16:08,131 --> 00:16:08,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing.

200
00:16:08,611 --> 00:16:10,192
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do just a short presentation.

201
00:16:10,212 --> 00:16:10,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Um.

202
00:16:11,993 --> 00:16:18,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Not not necessarily with a guest speaker, but I will just do a short presentation about electrify Medford.

203
00:16:18,977 --> 00:16:24,561
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then we'll have coaches there that people can talk to 1 on 1 to do a coaching session right there.

204
00:16:24,581 --> 00:16:26,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

205
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:29,614
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's March 4th, right?

206
00:16:30,094 --> 00:16:31,414
[SPEAKER_05]: March 4th at 1 PM.

207
00:16:31,434 --> 00:16:32,974
[SPEAKER_05]: 1 PM.

208
00:16:33,294 --> 00:16:33,535
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

209
00:16:33,555 --> 00:16:33,775
[SPEAKER_05]: So.

210
00:16:34,775 --> 00:16:41,136
[SPEAKER_05]: I can probably add that to the calendar just so people can be aware if they want to or not to jump drop in.

211
00:16:41,857 --> 00:16:42,097
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

212
00:16:43,297 --> 00:16:50,279
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm also trying to schedule 1 at the West Medford community center, but I haven't had it.

213
00:16:50,439 --> 00:16:52,179
[SPEAKER_02]: Haven't been able to get that.

214
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:54,920
[SPEAKER_02]: Scheduled yet.

215
00:16:56,753 --> 00:17:01,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Do any of you work closely with the folks from the West Medford Community Center?

216
00:17:01,474 --> 00:17:05,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, we all do.

217
00:17:05,474 --> 00:17:07,535
[SPEAKER_05]: We can definitely ask them.

218
00:17:07,555 --> 00:17:09,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we do ask?

219
00:17:10,395 --> 00:17:16,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because I've reached out by email and phone, and I haven't gotten a response.

220
00:17:16,636 --> 00:17:16,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

221
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:20,797
[SPEAKER_01]: We can bring that up at the meeting, yeah.

222
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:35,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and yeah, let me know if it would be helpful for me to drop by on Wednesday or anything, if that would be a better way to do it.

223
00:17:35,995 --> 00:17:37,195
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah.

224
00:17:37,295 --> 00:17:38,496
[SPEAKER_01]: If you like, yeah.

225
00:17:39,656 --> 00:17:41,057
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to crash your meeting.

226
00:17:42,998 --> 00:17:44,719
[SPEAKER_05]: Our meetings are informative.

227
00:17:44,859 --> 00:17:46,140
[SPEAKER_01]: It's open to everybody.

228
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:55,645
[SPEAKER_01]: But we can, I was just saying, we can bring it up with Sophie because she, she's like in contact with

229
00:17:57,675 --> 00:17:58,837
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's the director?

230
00:17:58,957 --> 00:18:00,260
[SPEAKER_01]: I think her name is Lisa.

231
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Lisa Crossman.

232
00:18:01,782 --> 00:18:03,566
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Lisa Crossman.

233
00:18:04,808 --> 00:18:05,028
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

234
00:18:07,372 --> 00:18:08,534
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that would be wonderful.

235
00:18:08,575 --> 00:18:08,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

236
00:18:11,898 --> 00:18:17,061
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to want to schedule more of these, but these are the ones that I'm focusing on right now.

237
00:18:17,081 --> 00:18:23,925
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the next big event from my office is we're going to do a rain barrel pickup.

238
00:18:24,605 --> 00:18:27,527
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's all the way out in May, but it's May 14th.

239
00:18:30,049 --> 00:18:36,032
[SPEAKER_02]: And the way that works is people will do lots of outreach about this.

240
00:18:36,212 --> 00:18:41,215
[SPEAKER_02]: And then people who are interested can purchase a rain barrel beforehand.

241
00:18:42,130 --> 00:19:04,301
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when the company drops all of the rain barrels off, then folks from my office and volunteers from the energy committee, or you guys if you're interested, would be there to hand out the rain barrels to the people who've purchased them.

242
00:19:05,382 --> 00:19:05,682
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

243
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:16,707
[SPEAKER_02]: And it doesn't seem like necessarily like a climate related thing, but stormwater is a big issue.

244
00:19:16,767 --> 00:19:29,658
[SPEAKER_02]: And so capturing stormwater off people's roofs and them using it for their gardens is definitely much better than it just kind of washing away all at once.

245
00:19:29,878 --> 00:19:31,280
[SPEAKER_02]: It's flooding, right Brenda?

246
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, exactly.

247
00:19:32,861 --> 00:19:34,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is climate change.

248
00:19:35,445 --> 00:19:36,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, definitely.

249
00:19:36,825 --> 00:19:44,688
[SPEAKER_02]: And with climate change, we've talked about this a lot before, but with climate change, because it's hotter, the air can hold more moisture.

250
00:19:45,068 --> 00:19:50,670
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that means that you go a lot longer without rain, because it's just holding on to that moisture.

251
00:19:51,131 --> 00:19:56,833
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when it finally gives it up, it's a huge storm, much bigger than it would be otherwise.

252
00:19:59,093 --> 00:20:00,874
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's why you get the stormwater flooding.

253
00:20:05,808 --> 00:20:09,171
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we've set the date for the next Harvest Your Energy Festival.

254
00:20:10,031 --> 00:20:11,993
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be October 18th.

255
00:20:13,294 --> 00:20:17,056
[SPEAKER_04]: October 18th, Harvest.

256
00:20:18,757 --> 00:20:29,245
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that you, I know that Medford Connects has your own table there, but we're also looking for volunteers to help run the event too.

257
00:20:30,911 --> 00:20:38,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Dozens of volunteers who help with like, set up with tear down with, with the actual running of the event in the middle of it.

258
00:20:38,653 --> 00:20:43,974
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, if that's something that you're interested in, we'd really appreciate it.

259
00:20:43,994 --> 00:20:48,275
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have like a signup sheet or do we let you know?

260
00:20:48,895 --> 00:20:49,055
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

261
00:20:49,155 --> 00:20:50,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, let, let me know.

262
00:20:50,316 --> 00:20:56,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then when we get closer to it, we'll have a signup sheet with like specific tasks that you can volunteer to do.

263
00:20:56,097 --> 00:20:57,057
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

264
00:20:57,157 --> 00:20:57,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

265
00:20:57,557 --> 00:21:00,178
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know what time Brenda on October 18th?

266
00:21:01,167 --> 00:21:06,832
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's usually one to three, something like that.

267
00:21:07,813 --> 00:21:08,093
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

268
00:21:08,453 --> 00:21:10,835
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just to put in our calendar, too, and let them know.

269
00:21:12,457 --> 00:21:17,581
[SPEAKER_02]: I can double check, actually, while we're on the call.

270
00:21:17,722 --> 00:21:19,203
[SPEAKER_02]: 12 to 3 is what it was last year.

271
00:21:20,184 --> 00:21:26,749
[SPEAKER_02]: But then for volunteers, setup usually starts around 10, and then breakdown lasts until 4.

272
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:26,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

273
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,701
[SPEAKER_05]: I would, I'll definitely volunteer for that.

274
00:21:31,721 --> 00:21:35,021
[SPEAKER_05]: That's great.

275
00:21:35,121 --> 00:21:36,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, absolutely.

276
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:45,384
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

277
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:48,265
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all that I have for events right now.

278
00:21:59,426 --> 00:22:02,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Should I jump into updates on city actions?

279
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:04,591
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

280
00:22:06,512 --> 00:22:12,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so for Electrify Medford, we've had 115 signups and 44 people coached.

281
00:22:12,117 --> 00:22:12,177
[SPEAKER_02]: And

282
00:22:28,923 --> 00:22:41,227
[SPEAKER_02]: With January energy bills being so much higher than what they were before, we're getting a lot of people thinking about how to reduce their energy costs.

283
00:22:42,108 --> 00:22:54,312
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of times it'll just be talking to them about making sure they're on the aggregation and talking to them about national grids discount rates and fuel assistance and things like that.

284
00:22:55,268 --> 00:23:01,730
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's also just a really good time to say and energy efficiency is another great way that you can lower your energy bills.

285
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:09,852
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just a good opportunity while people are thinking about it to talk with them about longer term things that they can do to their homes.

286
00:23:14,494 --> 00:23:22,036
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, a lot of people were hit with really high energy bills just because there were rate increases and

287
00:23:23,638 --> 00:23:28,541
[SPEAKER_02]: And that happened right around the same time as the, there was that huge cold snap.

288
00:23:28,641 --> 00:23:34,305
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're hit with bills that were a lot larger than they've ever had before.

289
00:23:39,368 --> 00:23:43,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that something that you have been hearing people talking about?

290
00:23:45,289 --> 00:23:46,069
[SPEAKER_01]: My father.

291
00:23:46,409 --> 00:23:50,032
[SPEAKER_05]: I was gonna say that's our balance, like my mom.

292
00:23:50,632 --> 00:23:52,413
[SPEAKER_01]: My father, yeah.

293
00:23:52,493 --> 00:23:56,796
[SPEAKER_01]: But he was saying that, I'm pretty sure he's on the aggregate.

294
00:23:58,257 --> 00:24:03,500
[SPEAKER_01]: But he was saying that, like, I know that direct energy is the supplier.

295
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:04,781
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

296
00:24:05,561 --> 00:24:05,941
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

297
00:24:06,221 --> 00:24:06,902
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

298
00:24:07,662 --> 00:24:13,646
[SPEAKER_01]: He wants to like, see if there's like something else because they're way too expensive.

299
00:24:15,214 --> 00:24:17,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's, it's cheaper than it was before.

300
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we actually dropped a cent.

301
00:24:21,929 --> 00:24:24,435
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, I think it's about a cent per kilowatt hour.

302
00:24:27,058 --> 00:24:28,219
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't know.

303
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:31,501
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he was just saying that it's just like really expensive.

304
00:24:32,541 --> 00:24:37,384
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because there was an increase on the delivery side of things, so our aggregations on the supply side.

305
00:24:37,944 --> 00:24:38,304
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

306
00:24:38,325 --> 00:24:43,147
[SPEAKER_02]: So no matter who you go with for the supply, the delivery cost is going to be the same.

307
00:24:43,187 --> 00:24:44,688
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all through national grid.

308
00:24:44,808 --> 00:24:45,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

309
00:24:46,889 --> 00:24:50,991
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, your parents should definitely sign up for Electrify Medford if they're interested.

310
00:24:51,011 --> 00:24:52,692
[SPEAKER_02]: We could do a coaching session with them.

311
00:24:52,993 --> 00:24:53,353
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

312
00:24:54,632 --> 00:24:55,952
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'll talk with them.

313
00:24:56,112 --> 00:24:59,513
[SPEAKER_01]: I have them enrolled in the fuel assistance as well.

314
00:25:01,494 --> 00:25:04,854
[SPEAKER_01]: And as well as like the national grid discount.

315
00:25:06,015 --> 00:25:14,337
[SPEAKER_02]: So that means that if they do want to get a home energy assessment and see what they can do for energy efficiency, it'll be 100% paid for.

316
00:25:14,357 --> 00:25:15,037
[SPEAKER_02]: They did before the new year.

317
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:21,780
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, they did.

318
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:22,741
[SPEAKER_02]: They already had somebody come in?

319
00:25:22,761 --> 00:25:24,401
[SPEAKER_01]: They got the home energy assessment, yes.

320
00:25:25,142 --> 00:25:41,988
[SPEAKER_01]: So now they're just waiting for them to contact them again to see how they can help with the insulation for the house and reducing energy costs and stuff.

321
00:25:43,729 --> 00:25:44,289
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.

322
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:45,670
[SPEAKER_05]: That's great.

323
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,391
[SPEAKER_05]: They're already doing the right thing.

324
00:25:47,431 --> 00:25:47,731
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

325
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:54,371
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I was going to ask you, Brenda, I think my parents would be interested in doing that home energy assessment.

326
00:25:56,792 --> 00:25:57,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.

327
00:25:57,992 --> 00:26:12,136
[SPEAKER_02]: I would encourage them to do a coaching session through Electrify Medford first, just to get some good advice before going into it.

328
00:26:14,924 --> 00:26:20,146
[SPEAKER_02]: But, yeah, there's I dropped the link into the chat where people can sign up for for electrify Medford.

329
00:26:23,387 --> 00:26:25,828
[SPEAKER_03]: No way I can get to.

330
00:26:29,989 --> 00:26:33,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this is this also included in your flyer?

331
00:26:35,071 --> 00:26:35,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it is.

332
00:26:35,711 --> 00:26:36,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

333
00:26:36,231 --> 00:26:36,491
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

334
00:26:36,531 --> 00:26:36,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

335
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, let's see here.

336
00:26:46,801 --> 00:26:55,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we're planning on doing, um, a big door hanger push in March.

337
00:26:55,847 --> 00:27:04,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I've been developing the message around that with a Northeastern professor who lives here in Medford, who, who does, who's a marketing professor.

338
00:27:04,072 --> 00:27:12,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so he's helping us put that together and then also getting some students to, um, to volunteer, to, uh, go door to door.

339
00:27:14,237 --> 00:27:17,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, not knocking on people's doors, but just leaving the door hangers there.

340
00:27:19,583 --> 00:27:24,449
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so that's something that we're planning for probably the second half of March.

341
00:27:24,469 --> 00:27:33,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so I'm hoping we get a big influx of it, people finding out through that.

342
00:27:37,153 --> 00:27:43,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but do you have any suggestions for other places where we could do the types of info sessions that I was talking about?

343
00:27:43,398 --> 00:27:48,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I did as a library, like we're doing at the senior center and West Med for community center.

344
00:27:56,569 --> 00:27:58,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Is school possibility like the schools?

345
00:28:00,032 --> 00:28:01,153
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.

346
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:03,920
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good idea.

347
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:07,382
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause people are already used to, you know, parents are already used to going there.

348
00:28:10,403 --> 00:28:11,623
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to say something Charbel?

349
00:28:13,664 --> 00:28:15,745
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, no, I'm just thinking.

350
00:28:16,825 --> 00:28:18,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I thought you were going to say something.

351
00:28:20,187 --> 00:28:27,129
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I mean, local police department.

352
00:28:27,149 --> 00:28:28,930
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think people would come to that?

353
00:28:30,338 --> 00:28:34,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I mean, we would do go there for doing what trainings and stuff.

354
00:28:35,322 --> 00:28:36,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you remember that Charbel?

355
00:28:36,823 --> 00:28:37,904
[SPEAKER_05]: We went to trainings there.

356
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:43,669
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but that's, that's us, you know, so we're talking about the general public.

357
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:44,750
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

358
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:50,875
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'm just saying to tie in with like, you know, organization, so they're not like scared.

359
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:51,996
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

360
00:28:55,937 --> 00:29:00,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I, I, for some reason, I would expect people to be afraid of going to something at the police station.

361
00:29:00,979 --> 00:29:01,459
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

362
00:29:04,101 --> 00:29:12,224
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I mean, you know, I just think of it more as like, it gives exposure to like, you know, them.

363
00:29:12,244 --> 00:29:17,246
[SPEAKER_05]: I was thinking, um, I don't know.

364
00:29:17,266 --> 00:29:17,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me think.

365
00:29:21,608 --> 00:29:23,409
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, those are the main ones from Medford.

366
00:29:24,713 --> 00:29:30,715
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know where, maybe we can use, we can do that as like a thinking.

367
00:29:31,476 --> 00:29:48,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there like community groups with that, that you think would be that, you know, that hold events like a, I don't know, you don't have some places we'll have like some sort of like hall or something where there's like a cultural group that gets together.

368
00:29:48,502 --> 00:29:53,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me see.

[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I'm looking for- Oh, it's the head injury program.

403
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:50,223
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm not sure if that is another thing we can do.

404
00:31:50,243 --> 00:31:52,425
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the Medford community

[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

410
00:32:56,027 --> 00:32:56,367
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

412
00:33:04,969 --> 00:33:06,370
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what is so funny?

413
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:09,811
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wish there was something connected to it.

[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

433
00:34:08,623 --> 00:34:13,764
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to tell you if I write imam, it's because it's like a... How do I explain that Charbel?

434
00:34:14,384 --> 00:34:19,966
[SPEAKER_05]: I was trying to see if... Trying to explain that to Brenda.

435
00:34:20,026 --> 00:34:25,067
[SPEAKER_05]: His name's not imam, but it's a... Oh, it's like someone who reads prayers or something, right?

436
00:34:25,107 --> 00:34:29,148
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's like the equivalent of the priest, pretty much.

437
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:30,328
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

438
00:34:30,848 --> 00:34:31,388
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes sense.

439
00:34:32,088 --> 00:34:32,808
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm gonna write that.

440
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:35,189
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I was clarifying.

441
00:34:35,489 --> 00:34:35,709
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

442
00:34:38,933 --> 00:34:39,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds good.

443
00:34:40,354 --> 00:34:43,937
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, yeah, but if you guys come up with any more ideas, shoot me an email.

444
00:34:45,598 --> 00:34:48,861
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, I have one quick one, Brenda.

445
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:54,806
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that new restaurant slash book place that is on that street?

446
00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:56,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Right in front of that.

447
00:34:58,508 --> 00:35:00,450
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the one that just opened, right?

448
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:01,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Charbel.

449
00:35:01,951 --> 00:35:02,792
[SPEAKER_05]: Which one is that one?

450
00:35:04,373 --> 00:35:05,154
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I forgot.

451
00:35:05,174 --> 00:35:06,375
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw it in the email.

452
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:15,125
[SPEAKER_01]: I was gonna say we can partner up with that, you know, actually, the mayor was literally talking about it in her address.

453
00:35:16,085 --> 00:35:17,546
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yes, he did.

454
00:35:17,566 --> 00:35:20,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my God, I forgot.

455
00:35:20,108 --> 00:35:24,931
[SPEAKER_05]: It's on it's on High Street.

456
00:35:25,752 --> 00:35:30,395
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like literally probably in front of that the bank.

457
00:35:32,036 --> 00:35:36,439
[SPEAKER_05]: Like between the bank and the in the Islamic cultural

458
00:35:38,707 --> 00:35:43,151
[SPEAKER_05]: One of those on the other side on the other side Brenda's of the street.

459
00:35:43,171 --> 00:35:44,291
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

460
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:45,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

461
00:35:45,993 --> 00:35:55,319
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes Mrs. Murphy's a new part.

462
00:35:55,419 --> 00:35:56,000
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it a pump?

463
00:35:57,690 --> 00:36:00,531
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's basically like a lot.

464
00:36:00,751 --> 00:36:06,492
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, it's like a, I don't even know if it was like half cafe, half library, but it was, it's really nice.

465
00:36:06,612 --> 00:36:07,632
[SPEAKER_05]: And they just open it.

466
00:36:07,652 --> 00:36:12,653
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was thinking that's a good place if we like, you know, obviously collabed with them.

467
00:36:13,453 --> 00:36:14,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm just looking it up.

468
00:36:14,533 --> 00:36:16,534
[SPEAKER_02]: It says moon and back bookstore.

469
00:36:17,974 --> 00:36:18,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me see.

470
00:36:18,394 --> 00:36:19,814
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a children's bookstore?

471
00:36:20,814 --> 00:36:24,175
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me see if it's looks like the one outside.

472
00:36:25,812 --> 00:36:28,334
[SPEAKER_05]: No, Brenda, I think you were.

473
00:36:30,915 --> 00:36:32,916
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

474
00:36:33,116 --> 00:36:33,397
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

475
00:36:33,537 --> 00:36:37,119
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, this is this is no, I'm talking about High Street in Medford, not Boston Ave.

476
00:36:37,879 --> 00:36:40,321
[SPEAKER_05]: If that's the one that says 458 High Street.

477
00:36:41,061 --> 00:36:41,461
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it did.

478
00:36:41,581 --> 00:36:44,363
[SPEAKER_05]: Why did I come out to high street?

479
00:36:44,403 --> 00:36:44,863
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me see.

480
00:36:45,103 --> 00:36:47,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, they probably have two locations then.

481
00:36:52,148 --> 00:36:52,568
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

482
00:36:53,688 --> 00:36:55,730
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and their grand opening was.

483
00:36:57,031 --> 00:36:58,112
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so it's dead now.

484
00:37:01,034 --> 00:37:02,015
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it's probably that one.

485
00:37:02,375 --> 00:37:02,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

486
00:37:02,795 --> 00:37:03,776
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, what is it called?

487
00:37:04,657 --> 00:37:05,658
[SPEAKER_05]: Moon and back.

488
00:37:06,618 --> 00:37:07,399
[SPEAKER_01]: Moon and back.

489
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,681
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I love you to the moon and back.

490
00:37:10,682 --> 00:37:10,942
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh.

491
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:12,283
[SPEAKER_01]: And okay.

492
00:37:13,664 --> 00:37:16,126
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to look it up.

493
00:37:16,346 --> 00:37:19,969
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's that one, Charbel, if I'm not going crazy.

494
00:37:23,587 --> 00:37:51,276
[SPEAKER_05]: moon and back book wonder oh so it's not like a cat it's not a cafe so i think um my mind's going crazy so i think when they bought it it was half the the one before that was half cafe half bookstore and then they i think they just did the bookstore because it was like that before that's why i remember not okay okay

495
00:37:53,268 --> 00:37:55,509
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's right in front of CB Scoop.

496
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:00,791
[SPEAKER_05]: It was really cute.

497
00:38:01,031 --> 00:38:01,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

498
00:38:02,431 --> 00:38:02,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

499
00:38:04,432 --> 00:38:04,792
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

500
00:38:05,052 --> 00:38:05,772
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like it was.

501
00:38:05,792 --> 00:38:06,773
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

502
00:38:07,273 --> 00:38:09,874
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll confirm it to you, Brenda.

503
00:38:11,814 --> 00:38:13,215
[SPEAKER_05]: But either way, that one's a good one.

504
00:38:13,955 --> 00:38:14,195
Cool.

505
00:38:16,116 --> 00:38:19,497
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, other Electrify Medford news.

506
00:38:20,237 --> 00:38:23,198
[SPEAKER_02]: We were supposed to have our training for like

507
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:31,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Last week, but they're holding off until the map.

508
00:38:31,547 --> 00:38:35,069
[SPEAKER_02]: The new mass safe plan is approved by the at the end of this month.

509
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:37,631
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're rescheduling it for.

510
00:38:37,651 --> 00:38:39,933
[SPEAKER_02]: April 4th is the 1st time they could reschedule it for.

511
00:38:40,013 --> 00:38:43,195
[SPEAKER_02]: So, that's the 1st time they could reschedule it for.

512
00:38:44,548 --> 00:38:52,991
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking forward to that because then I'll get updates directly from MassSave about their program so we can kick off that partnership.

513
00:38:53,051 --> 00:39:03,836
[SPEAKER_02]: So that'll be doing more outreach for Electrify Medford and increasing what we're doing so it's not just residents but also for small businesses too.

514
00:39:09,698 --> 00:39:10,258
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, what was that?

515
00:39:15,015 --> 00:39:24,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, the, the plan that's they're waiting for the DPU to approve has some updates.

516
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:32,222
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're not going to be any incentives for fossil fuel systems, except for income eligible residents.

517
00:39:33,843 --> 00:39:39,905
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're only doing electric equipment, like heat pumps.

518
00:39:42,332 --> 00:39:47,697
[SPEAKER_02]: The heat pump incentives will be dropping a little bit.

519
00:39:48,497 --> 00:39:52,300
[SPEAKER_02]: So instead of just a flat $10,000, it's going to be $3,000 per ton up to $10,000 for this year.

520
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,103
[SPEAKER_02]: And then next year, it'll drop a little bit to like $2,700 per ton.

521
00:40:04,346 --> 00:40:12,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Up to 8 and then up to 9000 dollars, and then 2027, it'll be 25 that 100 per ton up to 8000 dollars.

522
00:40:12,694 --> 00:40:12,894
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

523
00:40:15,497 --> 00:40:22,104
[SPEAKER_02]: Highlight their headline there, the heat pump incentives are sort of being reduced over time.

524
00:40:22,204 --> 00:40:25,487
[SPEAKER_02]: So, the sooner people can take advantage of them, the better.

525
00:40:28,414 --> 00:40:34,697
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the heat loan, the 0% interest heat loan will change based on income.

526
00:40:34,737 --> 00:40:38,959
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still going to be 0% interest for everybody, but the term is going to change.

527
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:39,499
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you.

528
00:40:41,845 --> 00:40:47,947
[SPEAKER_02]: are lower income, then you'll still have the seven-year loan available to you.

529
00:40:49,227 --> 00:40:58,549
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you focus on higher incomes, we'll have only a five-year loan available to them or a three-year loan depending on what their income is.

530
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:08,631
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they're just trying to reserve more of their money for folks who need it more.

531
00:41:11,663 --> 00:41:19,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, they're added, they've added a 120 volt heat pump, water heater rebate, um, and a split system heat pump, water heater.

532
00:41:19,926 --> 00:41:29,530
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the 120 volt heat pump, water heater, I think is good news because it means that people won't have to upgrade their wiring in order to install a heat pump.

533
00:41:30,831 --> 00:41:38,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so 120 volts is just a regular plugin and, uh, 240 volts, which is what they are right now.

534
00:41:38,874 --> 00:41:40,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that's more of a.

535
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:44,212
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, like, what you would plug in an electric dryer.

536
00:41:44,933 --> 00:41:48,055
[SPEAKER_02]: Into it's like a higher level.

537
00:41:48,836 --> 00:41:56,342
[SPEAKER_02]: Thing and so if you have to upgrade your wiring to that in order to install the water heater, then it's just another thing kind of standing in your way.

538
00:41:56,962 --> 00:41:59,304
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think this would be good up to this point.

539
00:41:59,744 --> 00:42:10,153
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't think that they were great for cold climate environments, but if mass save is incentivizing it, then that's a. Sort of a stamp of approval that that.

540
00:42:11,313 --> 00:42:11,613
[SPEAKER_02]: I like.

541
00:42:11,633 --> 00:42:13,194
[SPEAKER_01]: It's reliable.

542
00:42:13,854 --> 00:42:14,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

543
00:42:15,855 --> 00:42:17,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then the split system water heater.

544
00:42:18,096 --> 00:42:21,618
[SPEAKER_02]: So right now the heat pump water heaters are all one system.

545
00:42:21,698 --> 00:42:25,539
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just like a tall storage tank water heater basically.

546
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:38,945
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but you could also have water heaters that, um, where there's an indoor unit and an outdoor unit in the same way that like a mini split heat pump is you have like the outdoor condenser and then the, the, the.

547
00:42:39,726 --> 00:42:40,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Indoor unit as well.

548
00:42:42,745 --> 00:42:48,469
[SPEAKER_02]: So now they're adding that water heater as an option, which is good.

549
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:57,715
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they have 21 designated equity communities that will be getting higher incentives.

550
00:42:57,796 --> 00:43:01,918
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, Medford isn't one of them, which is too bad.

551
00:43:08,925 --> 00:43:13,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, I think that's it for Electrify Medford.

552
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:17,689
[SPEAKER_02]: A few more quick updates.

553
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:37,478
[SPEAKER_02]: The Andrews and McGlynn HVAC project, we're selecting a construction manager for that this week actually, and then we'll be trying to onboard them as quickly as possible so that we can get to pre-ordering the equipment with long lead times so that we'll have the equipment in time to install this summer.

554
00:43:39,827 --> 00:43:40,607
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exciting.

555
00:43:41,167 --> 00:43:53,189
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we were just interviewing some of them today and talking about different ways, different suggestions they have for things that we can do to try to shorten the lead time for some of the equipment.

556
00:43:53,410 --> 00:43:53,950
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

557
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:56,070
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be great.

558
00:43:56,130 --> 00:44:01,451
[SPEAKER_01]: Because this has been in the works for a long time, right?

559
00:44:01,751 --> 00:44:03,831
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a really long process.

560
00:44:03,851 --> 00:44:05,732
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a surprisingly long process.

561
00:44:06,032 --> 00:44:06,252
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

562
00:44:08,166 --> 00:44:14,428
[SPEAKER_02]: So it means that we won't have new air conditioning going into the summer.

563
00:44:15,149 --> 00:44:25,732
[SPEAKER_02]: But hopefully, by the time where students are coming back to school, if it's hot, then we'll have air conditioning in place for that, at least in the classrooms.

564
00:44:26,012 --> 00:44:26,232
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

565
00:44:28,213 --> 00:44:28,993
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very good.

566
00:44:32,574 --> 00:44:34,075
[SPEAKER_05]: At least the next generation has AC.

567
00:44:37,474 --> 00:44:38,154
[SPEAKER_02]: They need it.

568
00:44:38,254 --> 00:44:39,534
[SPEAKER_02]: It's getting, it's getting hotter.

569
00:44:39,554 --> 00:44:48,436
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember when we would be in the, in the school and it'd be so hot and we'd have to find any way, shape or form to be like cool.

570
00:44:48,496 --> 00:44:55,538
[SPEAKER_05]: We'd make like the paper fans, like anything just to like open the windows, doors, everything.

571
00:44:55,598 --> 00:44:56,278
[SPEAKER_05]: It was crazy.

572
00:44:56,298 --> 00:44:58,939
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm really happy that at least, you know.

573
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:03,061
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a big, big leap and a big step forward.

574
00:45:03,741 --> 00:45:03,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

575
00:45:04,422 --> 00:45:11,166
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be a really big deal with a high school project too, whether they renovate the high school or completely replace it.

576
00:45:11,927 --> 00:45:17,951
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, air conditioning is a big deal there because some classrooms don't have windows that they can open there.

577
00:45:18,671 --> 00:45:19,692
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

578
00:45:19,712 --> 00:45:22,073
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember that was, that's the worst.

579
00:45:23,414 --> 00:45:26,096
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd have to move to another space because it was too much.

580
00:45:27,577 --> 00:45:27,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

581
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:31,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see what else here.

582
00:45:31,922 --> 00:45:37,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we're planning to do a plug load audit at the library because since

583
00:45:41,941 --> 00:45:47,886
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been since it's been built, it's it's been using more electricity than we expected it to.

584
00:45:49,768 --> 00:45:53,911
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've done some things like make changes to the building automation schedule.

585
00:45:53,972 --> 00:45:59,656
[SPEAKER_02]: So, like, the lighting and the heating schedule and things like that, but we're still seeing higher energy usage.

586
00:45:59,696 --> 00:46:06,923
[SPEAKER_02]: So we think it might be staff things that staff are plugging into outlets that that's higher than expected.

587
00:46:08,617 --> 00:46:12,040
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the point of the plug load audit is just to see what's actually being plugged in.

588
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:19,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see what else here.

589
00:46:20,046 --> 00:46:26,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we are applying for a mass clean energy center on street charging grant.

590
00:46:28,172 --> 00:46:36,319
[SPEAKER_02]: So the idea of this is that it's for curbside EV charging so that people

591
00:46:37,262 --> 00:46:48,766
[SPEAKER_02]: In neighborhoods where there aren't a lot of driveways, there are more people parking there than there are driveways can charge in their neighborhood overnight.

592
00:46:51,286 --> 00:46:55,047
[SPEAKER_02]: Anytime, but really, like, overnight charging is a is a really useful thing.

593
00:46:56,928 --> 00:46:58,809
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this grant will pay for.

594
00:46:58,829 --> 00:47:03,270
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they said.

595
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:10,082
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe three to five locations per municipality.

596
00:47:11,843 --> 00:47:18,366
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're looking at neighborhoods where there's a lot of smaller multifamily buildings.

597
00:47:20,127 --> 00:47:25,369
[SPEAKER_02]: So might have renters or people without driveways try to locate these.

598
00:47:25,769 --> 00:47:31,351
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think if we get this grant, which pays for 100% of the cost, it wouldn't cost us anything.

599
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,321
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's, it's actually a really great grant.

600
00:47:35,341 --> 00:47:37,262
[SPEAKER_02]: So, if we do get it.

601
00:47:39,303 --> 00:47:46,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of the 1st, things that we'll do will be identifying exactly what locations we want to install these charging stations at.

602
00:47:47,707 --> 00:47:59,973
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that'll be a lot of community outreach just to make sure that, you know, we're putting them in areas where people actually want them and that we don't have people upset because we've put chargers in their neighborhood.

603
00:48:00,033 --> 00:48:00,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically.

604
00:48:03,303 --> 00:48:07,325
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you guys going to be in charge of figuring out where the people want it?

605
00:48:07,345 --> 00:48:11,426
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so we will be working with a consultant.

606
00:48:11,626 --> 00:48:12,947
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's basically what we're getting for this.

607
00:48:12,967 --> 00:48:13,867
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not getting the money.

608
00:48:13,907 --> 00:48:21,410
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting the consultant and the charging stations installed too.

609
00:48:23,951 --> 00:48:26,472
[SPEAKER_02]: So the consultant will help us to figure that out.

610
00:48:26,892 --> 00:48:29,153
[SPEAKER_02]: But we'll be doing a lot of outreach around that.

611
00:48:29,253 --> 00:48:31,854
[SPEAKER_02]: And so once we start doing that, I'll definitely be

612
00:48:32,375 --> 00:48:36,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking to you guys to help with with some of that outreach to awesome.

613
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:52,473
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it would be good to, like, when we get to that point to be able to go to, like, if we have, like, an event near there or something, like, Hey, like, this is what we have and we talk about it and see whoever wants to like, but they're like idea, like, oh.

614
00:48:53,073 --> 00:48:58,238
[SPEAKER_05]: This may be like, where I live, it might be a good place and then you can sort of get it from there.

615
00:48:59,679 --> 00:49:13,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I can envision, like, putting out surveys for people to answer and having, like, focus groups where people can come and, you know, put things on a map or, yeah, like you said, at events, we can have, like, a map there where people can place things.

616
00:49:15,649 --> 00:49:16,009
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

617
00:49:17,050 --> 00:49:21,973
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be good.

618
00:49:22,173 --> 00:49:27,377
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, let's see, the Energy Committee, their last meeting, we have two new members.

619
00:49:31,095 --> 00:49:36,818
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have one of them is really focused on zero waste and wants to start a zero waste Medford initiative.

620
00:49:38,179 --> 00:49:53,348
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're talking about doing a. Um, kind of like a June Christmas event where when students are, um, leaving, um, doing some sort of event where they can, like.

621
00:49:54,340 --> 00:50:01,442
[SPEAKER_02]: put things out on the street for free and put things, you know, sign up on a map to say where they are and what, what they're putting out.

622
00:50:02,503 --> 00:50:12,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then, and also have like an actual, like event at some centralized location where people can bring things that they want to, to swap with people basically.

623
00:50:16,087 --> 00:50:19,008
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's something that they are working on.

624
00:50:19,028 --> 00:50:20,388
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so cool.

625
00:50:22,025 --> 00:50:26,328
[SPEAKER_02]: And off-campus student services at Tufts is really interested in working on this with them.

626
00:50:26,388 --> 00:50:29,810
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're meeting with them, I think, next.

627
00:50:32,212 --> 00:50:34,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're meeting with them next week to talk about it.

628
00:50:39,076 --> 00:50:40,617
[SPEAKER_02]: They're also looking to do.

629
00:50:41,978 --> 00:50:53,245
[SPEAKER_02]: a social media campaign during Earth Month where they have, we put out daily tips for, for things that people can do to, um, to help to save the earth.

630
00:50:53,826 --> 00:51:11,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and so, yeah, um, I, they haven't put out a shared spreadsheet yet, but they're going to have a shared document where people can submit their ideas and then they're going to, to sort of narrow those down to, um, to

631
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:14,120
[SPEAKER_02]: 30 of those basically.

632
00:51:14,441 --> 00:51:23,507
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, so that we can then work with the comms team and get the messages out daily.

633
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:34,955
[SPEAKER_05]: When you get to that point, Brenda, maybe we can send an email to Catherine and I can post that on our Facebook.

634
00:51:36,836 --> 00:51:37,376
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.

635
00:51:37,396 --> 00:51:37,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

636
00:51:38,877 --> 00:51:39,658
[SPEAKER_05]: More exposure.

637
00:51:42,887 --> 00:51:50,057
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you want to contribute to the tips, then I can share that link with you guys, too.

638
00:51:50,077 --> 00:51:52,440
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, please.

639
00:51:58,070 --> 00:52:08,013
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they're also looking to work with restaurants to get them to use more recyclable and compostable containers.

640
00:52:09,234 --> 00:52:22,598
[SPEAKER_02]: They're especially interested in getting restaurants to move away from black plastic, which tends not to be recycled, just because the sorting machines can't identify what type of plastic it is.

641
00:52:25,895 --> 00:52:29,317
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think there are more health issues around the black plastic as well.

642
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:43,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so yeah, so they're looking to, um, create some materials that they can give out to businesses and they're looking to put together a list of businesses for them to do outreach to.

643
00:52:45,324 --> 00:52:47,805
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not the whole group that's working on all of this.

644
00:52:47,845 --> 00:52:52,907
[SPEAKER_02]: They've sort of, um, broken up into small groups and are, uh,

645
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:58,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Each one is taking on a different task that they want to do.

646
00:53:05,187 --> 00:53:07,648
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'll share any materials that they come up with.

647
00:53:07,748 --> 00:53:09,369
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll definitely share that with you.

648
00:53:09,389 --> 00:53:15,213
[SPEAKER_02]: And if there's anything like that that you'd be interested in working on, let me know.

649
00:53:19,315 --> 00:53:23,458
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we also, last meeting, we had a presentation by Matt Barlow.

650
00:53:26,183 --> 00:53:33,268
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a meteorologist and he's an expert on precipitation and drought and water cycles.

651
00:53:33,669 --> 00:53:36,851
[SPEAKER_02]: He teaches at UMass Lowell, but he lives here in Medford.

652
00:53:38,152 --> 00:53:45,758
[SPEAKER_02]: But he was a lead author on water changes for the IPCC sixth assessment report.

653
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:47,700
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's a

654
00:53:48,458 --> 00:53:54,180
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely an expert in all of this as it, you know, water changes as it relates to climate change.

655
00:53:55,180 --> 00:54:06,644
[SPEAKER_02]: And he gave us a presentation on this new Climate Change Center at UMass Lowell and some of the work that he's been doing and will be doing in the next few months.

656
00:54:06,684 --> 00:54:10,605
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can share that presentation with you.

657
00:54:10,625 --> 00:54:12,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

658
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:20,521
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's it for updates on city actions.

659
00:54:26,364 --> 00:54:30,286
[SPEAKER_02]: I see that the next thing on the agenda is a hazard mitigation plan update.

660
00:54:32,006 --> 00:54:38,769
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you been very involved in that and would you like to give an update on that or would you like me to?

661
00:54:38,789 --> 00:54:45,352
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than the meeting that we attended the other day,

662
00:54:47,462 --> 00:54:48,903
[SPEAKER_01]: been involved other than that.

663
00:54:49,583 --> 00:54:49,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

664
00:54:50,083 --> 00:54:50,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

665
00:54:50,803 --> 00:54:53,965
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, yeah.

666
00:54:53,985 --> 00:54:55,826
[SPEAKER_02]: So our first public, what was that?

667
00:54:55,866 --> 00:54:57,366
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that last week?

668
00:54:58,387 --> 00:55:00,568
[SPEAKER_01]: Last Monday or the Monday before?

669
00:55:01,108 --> 00:55:01,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

670
00:55:01,708 --> 00:55:01,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

671
00:55:01,988 --> 00:55:03,989
[SPEAKER_02]: It was last, last Monday, I think.

672
00:55:05,890 --> 00:55:10,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, or yeah, two Mondays ago.

673
00:55:10,272 --> 00:55:10,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

674
00:55:10,612 --> 00:55:11,032
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

675
00:55:14,275 --> 00:55:20,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but yeah, so that was the 1st public meeting, um, and then they're going to do focus groups and surveys.

676
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:30,625
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the 2nd public meeting will be in June and then they'll have some findings and maps and things like that for people to respond to.

677
00:55:30,645 --> 00:55:35,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then they'll get feedback on that.

678
00:55:35,609 --> 00:55:38,170
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the final public meeting will be in September.

679
00:55:40,752 --> 00:55:40,852
[SPEAKER_02]: Um.

680
00:55:43,205 --> 00:55:49,609
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think they're trying to do the bulk of the focus groups and surveys before that 2nd, public meeting in June.

681
00:55:55,193 --> 00:56:00,616
[SPEAKER_02]: But, yeah, so the, the, the hazard mitigation plan, it's supposed to be updated every 5 years.

682
00:56:01,997 --> 00:56:10,162
[SPEAKER_02]: But our last update was 2019. so we're a little bit behind on that, which is why we're.

683
00:56:10,829 --> 00:56:13,030
[SPEAKER_02]: We're working on that now and it's a long process.

684
00:56:14,091 --> 00:56:15,412
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I can imagine.

685
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:16,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

686
00:56:17,473 --> 00:56:23,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and there are three internal city committees that are working on this.

687
00:56:24,938 --> 00:56:27,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so I'm on one of them.

688
00:56:27,099 --> 00:56:30,542
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I think you guys are on one of them too, right?

689
00:56:30,702 --> 00:56:38,807
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is that just the, is that the office of prevention and outreach that is more.

690
00:56:40,396 --> 00:56:42,817
[SPEAKER_02]: involved in that?

691
00:56:43,937 --> 00:56:49,319
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's more like Andrean and her consulting company.

692
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:53,321
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're not really involved.

693
00:56:53,921 --> 00:56:54,201
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

694
00:56:54,681 --> 00:56:57,842
[SPEAKER_02]: The internal committee that I'm on, we've only met once so far.

695
00:57:00,303 --> 00:57:01,504
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's similar to the public.

696
00:57:01,524 --> 00:57:03,745
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a similar cadence as the public meetings.

697
00:57:03,805 --> 00:57:09,927
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's only we're probably going to meet three or four times between now and September.

698
00:57:12,309 --> 00:57:15,571
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, and those, um.

699
00:57:16,231 --> 00:57:23,936
[SPEAKER_01]: This hazard mitigation plan is this, like, going to be kind of combining those.

700
00:57:25,056 --> 00:57:27,478
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess, integrating those, like, resilience hubs.

701
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:36,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Supposed to be that might be 1 of the sort of, like, recommendations coming out of it.

702
00:57:37,824 --> 00:57:39,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, like, if the.

703
00:57:40,043 --> 00:57:48,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Resilience hubs existed that would be one of the critical infrastructure pieces that would be identified in the hazard mitigation plan.

704
00:57:48,969 --> 00:57:49,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

705
00:57:51,590 --> 00:57:53,511
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I would imagine.

706
00:57:54,032 --> 00:57:56,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

707
00:57:56,593 --> 00:58:03,438
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we also have a climate vulnerability assessment, which is similar, but a little bit different than the hazard mitigation plan.

708
00:58:03,478 --> 00:58:05,479
[SPEAKER_02]: The hazard mitigation is looking at

709
00:58:06,533 --> 00:58:09,374
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, all types of hazards, not just, um.

710
00:58:10,115 --> 00:58:14,537
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, not just heat and storm water and things like that, but also, um.

711
00:58:17,798 --> 00:58:25,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I'm thinking, like, cobit like diseases like cobit was is 1 of those things that would be considered a hazard that might be included in there.

712
00:58:25,061 --> 00:58:25,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Um.

713
00:58:27,975 --> 00:58:31,656
[SPEAKER_02]: But so we're also updating the climate vulnerability assessment this year.

714
00:58:31,916 --> 00:58:36,537
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of overlap between the two, especially when it comes to heat and storm water and things like that.

715
00:58:38,157 --> 00:58:47,920
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm working with the team that's putting that together, just updating the data behind it, not redoing any of the public outreach around that.

716
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:56,582
[SPEAKER_02]: But just since there are new storm water maps and things like that that need to be considered as part of it.

717
00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:06,642
[SPEAKER_02]: But I put that team in contact with Andre on and Marianne so that we can make sure we're not duplicating anything.

718
00:59:12,243 --> 00:59:12,944
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.

719
00:59:12,984 --> 00:59:17,185
[SPEAKER_05]: So, September, will we be all joining that meeting?

720
00:59:17,205 --> 00:59:23,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, ideally, you would be joining the meeting in June and the meeting in September.

721
00:59:23,806 --> 00:59:25,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

722
00:59:26,187 --> 00:59:26,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

723
00:59:33,213 --> 00:59:36,153
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then also, once they're, you know, they have the.

724
00:59:37,294 --> 00:59:41,635
[SPEAKER_02]: The survey put together and they are scheduling focus groups.

725
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:44,415
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure they'll be looking to to you to help with outreach.

726
00:59:45,096 --> 00:59:45,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Around that as well.

727
00:59:54,518 --> 00:59:56,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything on the hazard.

728
00:59:57,078 --> 00:59:59,724
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other questions or anything on the hazard mitigation plan?

729
01:00:01,909 --> 01:00:02,751
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I mean, like.

730
01:00:04,896 --> 01:00:07,001
[SPEAKER_05]: You're Brenda, you working alongside.

731
01:00:08,745 --> 01:00:31,980
[SPEAKER_05]: Marianne and Andrea or is it like they're doing it and you're part of it because I was remember the idea I told you uh you guys to like have like maybe like for you know the next five year one like plan to have like a box like at the library or it's at Medford you know City Hall just like have people like put in like

732
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:35,041
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, their inquiries and stuff like that.

733
01:00:35,061 --> 01:00:40,703
[SPEAKER_05]: So that way, you're better prepared for like, the next five years, like, you know what I mean?

734
01:00:40,723 --> 01:00:42,904
[SPEAKER_05]: So that way, you're like, like a jump head on it.

735
01:00:43,384 --> 01:00:49,366
[SPEAKER_05]: And that way, you're not like, you know, caught off guard and have to do all this type of stuff and be more easier.

736
01:00:49,386 --> 01:00:51,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, that makes sense.

737
01:00:51,467 --> 01:00:55,068
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially when it comes to something like the survey, for instance, you know, having a

738
01:00:56,600 --> 01:01:02,684
[SPEAKER_02]: physical places where people can fill that out and drop it into a box is a great idea.

739
01:01:02,704 --> 01:01:09,647
[SPEAKER_02]: And doing them in times of year when people are actually thinking about these types of hazards, right?

740
01:01:09,747 --> 01:01:18,472
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the middle of summer when it's hot or the middle of winter when they're getting snow and things like that, yeah.

741
01:01:19,697 --> 01:01:35,921
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing even when it's like that, like, you know, how we have like our table, we can have like the box and like, just something there next to like, your flyer or something for like, electrify method and say, hey, like, if you guys want to, you know, inquiry or do whatever, you know, let us know and you can put it there.

742
01:01:36,001 --> 01:01:43,903
[SPEAKER_05]: And that way, you know, you'd have like, the data enough from people themselves to like, say, okay, this can help you out.

743
01:01:44,383 --> 01:01:44,783
[SPEAKER_05]: You know?

744
01:01:44,863 --> 01:01:45,003
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

745
01:01:47,812 --> 01:01:48,272
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.

746
01:01:48,592 --> 01:01:49,953
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, yeah, definitely.

747
01:01:50,093 --> 01:01:52,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Andrea is, is taking point on this.

748
01:01:53,314 --> 01:01:58,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and Marianne in her office, um, I'm.

749
01:02:00,277 --> 01:02:07,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Involved in, like I said, that internal committee where they're getting feedback from different departments in the city.

750
01:02:07,841 --> 01:02:11,622
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how where my involvement has been so far.

751
01:02:12,683 --> 01:02:12,903
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

752
01:02:13,243 --> 01:02:13,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

753
01:02:18,798 --> 01:02:20,459
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say, we can probably, um.

754
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:28,883
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, hopefully she, she got no, I think she did get no, but just in case July, you know, we can, like, bring it up.

755
01:02:29,423 --> 01:02:29,623
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

756
01:02:30,944 --> 01:02:32,385
[SPEAKER_05]: Just so we can have, you know.

757
01:02:33,705 --> 01:02:36,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Repetition in case it wasn't recorded at the time.

758
01:02:36,787 --> 01:02:37,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

759
01:02:37,647 --> 01:02:38,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, because I mean.

760
01:02:39,813 --> 01:02:50,980
[SPEAKER_05]: We can also like help with that in the sense because like, you know, since we have a lot of events before that meeting, I think it'd be good to just maybe jump started.

761
01:02:51,460 --> 01:02:51,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

762
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:52,981
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.

763
01:02:54,922 --> 01:02:57,383
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe something to talk about with them on Wednesday.

764
01:02:58,364 --> 01:02:58,664
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

765
01:02:59,004 --> 01:03:00,085
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I agree.

766
01:03:01,206 --> 01:03:01,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely.

767
01:03:05,335 --> 01:03:11,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it looks like the next update I have on is on the zoning updates and the, the green score.

768
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:21,866
[SPEAKER_02]: So we talked before about the fact that the city's doing a zoning re, codification, um, and it started with the mystic of and the Salem street corridors.

769
01:03:23,207 --> 01:03:30,932
[SPEAKER_02]: You might have heard lots of comments, you know, in social media and stuff about the, the Salem street zoning in particular.

770
01:03:30,992 --> 01:03:34,474
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been a lot of, um, interest in that.

771
01:03:37,084 --> 01:03:47,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the zoning is focused on things like the height of buildings, setbacks, parking, what parking is required, and what types of uses the buildings can have.

772
01:03:48,249 --> 01:03:50,590
[SPEAKER_02]: But a part of this too is the green score.

773
01:03:52,691 --> 01:03:58,014
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is, let me actually drop a link to this in the chat.

774
01:04:02,136 --> 01:04:03,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me know if you have any problems.

775
01:04:08,576 --> 01:04:11,577
[SPEAKER_02]: But the green score is basically.

776
01:04:14,338 --> 01:04:16,158
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a basically a storm water.

777
01:04:16,898 --> 01:04:19,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Thing, so you have.

778
01:04:21,079 --> 01:04:28,722
[SPEAKER_02]: Different sort of natural ways that you can reduce the amount of storm water runoff on a property.

779
01:04:28,742 --> 01:04:32,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, let me share my screen here.

780
01:04:32,283 --> 01:04:33,283
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can look at.

781
01:04:40,615 --> 01:04:41,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you see my screen now?

782
01:04:45,076 --> 01:04:47,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so, yeah, so the green score, basically.

783
01:04:50,018 --> 01:04:54,419
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a minimum score that you would have to.

784
01:04:54,980 --> 01:05:02,362
[SPEAKER_02]: For for new developments or major renovations, you would have to have a minimum score that you'd have to hit.

785
01:05:03,306 --> 01:05:14,951
[SPEAKER_02]: And then different elements, landscaping elements, would have different number of points so that they would all add up to that minimum number.

786
01:05:15,451 --> 01:05:24,875
[SPEAKER_02]: So for instance, you know, planted areas or bioretention facilities, places where it can hold water and let it absorb into the ground slower.

787
01:05:26,396 --> 01:05:30,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Like mulch or shrubs or trees, different sizes of trees have different

788
01:05:32,478 --> 01:05:41,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Preservation of existing trees, green roofs, or vegetated walls.

789
01:05:43,663 --> 01:05:49,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if you do have to have paving, have it be permeable paving so that the water can be absorbed down through it.

790
01:05:53,528 --> 01:05:55,209
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there are different bonuses here.

791
01:05:55,729 --> 01:05:59,671
[SPEAKER_02]: Landscaping that consists entirely of native or

792
01:06:00,673 --> 01:06:02,474
[SPEAKER_02]: non-invasive plant species.

793
01:06:04,635 --> 01:06:24,806
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have more than half of your irrigation needs are met through harvested rainwater or collected gray water, including landscaping, including food cultivation and the right for people to harvest that food.

794
01:06:27,027 --> 01:06:28,748
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, so the idea is it's a

795
01:06:29,489 --> 01:06:37,577
[SPEAKER_02]: So, they can choose between different aspects of things that they can put together.

796
01:06:37,638 --> 01:06:46,166
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not saying you have to do one thing, but it's just everything that you do has to add together to have the same sort of impact.

797
01:06:46,186 --> 01:06:49,049
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thank you.

798
01:06:50,347 --> 01:06:53,869
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is for this isn't for the whole city.

799
01:06:54,610 --> 01:07:00,193
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's for FEMA flood zones and for parcels requiring site plan review.

800
01:07:00,253 --> 01:07:09,919
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are the really big ones over ten thousand square feet or residential buildings over six units.

801
01:07:11,279 --> 01:07:17,383
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, the idea is that for large properties like that, just trying to increase the amount of water that the.

802
01:07:18,541 --> 01:07:34,213
[SPEAKER_02]: The land is able to absorb there, and so that was discussed by the community development board on February 5th and then.

803
01:07:34,233 --> 01:07:38,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Or it might have been continued.

804
01:07:38,396 --> 01:07:44,461
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I need to double check that because there was so much discussion about the Salem street zoning that the green score might have gotten bumped.

805
01:07:46,923 --> 01:07:47,864
[SPEAKER_02]: I will double check that.

806
01:07:49,702 --> 01:07:53,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then so after the community development board.

807
01:07:54,066 --> 01:07:59,412
[SPEAKER_02]: If they approve it, then it would go to city council to be discussed by them and it would have to get approved by them too.

808
01:08:09,101 --> 01:08:13,466
[SPEAKER_02]: But the idea is, because it is a little bit complicated for people to figure out how to.

809
01:08:15,163 --> 01:08:19,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Meet those requirements that it's not, you know, it's not just going to be a single family home.

810
01:08:20,006 --> 01:08:24,550
[SPEAKER_02]: That's having to do this unless they're in a FEMA flood zone, in which case.

811
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:29,133
[SPEAKER_02]: They have more incentive to to address rainwater.

812
01:08:38,739 --> 01:08:40,861
[SPEAKER_02]: Any questions about the green score.

813
01:08:51,386 --> 01:08:53,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, let me know if you're interested in.

814
01:08:54,446 --> 01:08:56,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Finding out more about it, or, um.

815
01:08:56,167 --> 01:09:01,108
[SPEAKER_02]: I can let, you know, when the next, um.

816
01:09:02,029 --> 01:09:07,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Community development board meeting is for it or or city council meeting when that gets scheduled if you're interested.

817
01:09:07,050 --> 01:09:13,492
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think it'd be good to have the option of going.

818
01:09:14,472 --> 01:09:14,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

819
01:09:16,417 --> 01:09:18,959
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe an email with all of us.

820
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:20,941
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, we'll do.

821
01:09:26,165 --> 01:09:32,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, and then the only other thing it looks like we have on the agenda is federal funding.

822
01:09:32,450 --> 01:09:41,337
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to just give people an update here because it's been so in the news.

823
01:09:43,566 --> 01:09:55,260
[SPEAKER_02]: But we've been talking with other municipalities and with our congresspeople, and it sounds like, legally,

824
01:09:56,097 --> 01:10:20,937
[SPEAKER_02]: any sort of funding freeze, or review, or whatever you want to call it, shouldn't apply to previously approved, congressionally directed spending, also known as earmarks, or formula grants, which are grants that are based on population, like it's, you're not applying for it, you just automatically get it, and the amount that you get is based on your population.

825
01:10:22,743 --> 01:10:38,765
[SPEAKER_02]: It shouldn't apply to work-study and it shouldn't apply to tax credits because those are all things that are approved by Congress and so Congress would have to have some sort of action in order to make any change to those.

826
01:10:41,790 --> 01:11:00,946
[SPEAKER_02]: So things in my office like our community development block grants or our earmark that we have for Carr Park or the energy related tax credits that we talk to people about for Electrify Medford.

827
01:11:03,233 --> 01:11:05,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Those it shouldn't apply to those now.

828
01:11:05,254 --> 01:11:10,936
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't mean that this administration won't try to make it apply to those and there won't be all kinds of, like, legal back and forth about it.

829
01:11:11,917 --> 01:11:13,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but it sounds.

830
01:11:15,118 --> 01:11:19,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty people seem relatively comfortable that there's a good legal argument that.

831
01:11:20,261 --> 01:11:23,222
[SPEAKER_02]: That they shouldn't be able to unilaterally, um.

832
01:11:23,862 --> 01:11:24,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Make changes to those.

833
01:11:29,868 --> 01:11:39,074
[SPEAKER_02]: And tax credits in particular, if they are changed by Congress this year, any changes would then have to take effect the following tax year.

834
01:11:39,854 --> 01:11:43,637
[SPEAKER_02]: So if people are installing things this year, they should be fine.

835
01:11:47,019 --> 01:11:48,399
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows what will happen after that?

836
01:11:51,321 --> 01:11:54,423
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, that's a headline there.

837
01:11:55,724 --> 01:11:58,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Doing these things sooner rather than later is a good idea.

838
01:11:59,787 --> 01:12:00,127
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

839
01:12:02,589 --> 01:12:04,631
[SPEAKER_01]: Lord help us.

840
01:12:07,653 --> 01:12:08,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

841
01:12:08,774 --> 01:12:17,341
[SPEAKER_02]: We were anticipating that the Massachusetts Solar for All program would be starting soon because their plan was approved by the federal government.

842
01:12:18,042 --> 01:12:21,865
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't think they've received any money from the federal government yet.

843
01:12:22,806 --> 01:12:25,508
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've heard that that's a program that's

844
01:12:26,562 --> 01:12:27,322
[SPEAKER_02]: being targeted.

845
01:12:27,782 --> 01:12:32,304
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know if Massachusetts will get the funding for that program yet.

846
01:12:32,444 --> 01:12:33,445
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see what happens.

847
01:12:34,425 --> 01:12:35,225
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully.

848
01:12:37,806 --> 01:12:38,747
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.

849
01:12:40,988 --> 01:12:44,109
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that these aren't necessarily the most important things to people.

850
01:12:44,169 --> 01:12:47,090
[SPEAKER_02]: I know there are a lot of people who are really worried about

851
01:12:48,171 --> 01:12:52,232
[SPEAKER_02]: immigration and people being targeted for that.

852
01:12:52,592 --> 01:13:06,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that something that's making your jobs harder, do you think, that people are talking to city staff less because of that?

853
01:13:09,896 --> 01:13:11,636
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so, yeah.

854
01:13:11,776 --> 01:13:14,997
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's definitely a fear there.

855
01:13:15,017 --> 01:13:15,117
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

856
01:13:17,205 --> 01:13:41,316
[SPEAKER_01]: in the community where they think that like maybe they might be at risk of getting caught by speaking to government officials, even if we have no correlation with, you know, like ICE or whatever other agencies that are participating in that, you know.

857
01:13:42,786 --> 01:13:42,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

858
01:13:44,347 --> 01:13:52,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any messaging that you're putting out for people to try to share information with them about this sort of thing?

859
01:13:53,769 --> 01:13:54,250
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

860
01:13:55,410 --> 01:13:57,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we going to get trainings, Charbon?

861
01:13:59,051 --> 01:13:59,891
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so.

862
01:14:02,172 --> 01:14:07,394
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's always like, they're always circulating like the,

863
01:14:08,830 --> 01:14:22,419
[SPEAKER_01]: the Office for Refugees and Immigrants, community conversations, like there's always meetings and seminars about those, and a bunch of resources for people to know their rights and stuff.

864
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:30,684
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's been like pretty much flooded my emails in the past few weeks.

865
01:14:33,566 --> 01:14:37,770
[SPEAKER_02]: From your office in particular or just from a lot of different sources?

866
01:14:37,850 --> 01:14:48,519
[SPEAKER_01]: Just being circulated from either from our office or from the Office for Refugees and Immigrants.

867
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:51,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you share that?

868
01:14:51,761 --> 01:14:53,082
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be really interested to see.

869
01:14:53,102 --> 01:14:54,984
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I can forward it to you.

870
01:14:55,004 --> 01:14:59,067
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one that's really good, has a bunch of links.

871
01:15:05,089 --> 01:15:11,112
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say, Brenda, like, I feel like from what I've heard, everyone's like freaking out.

872
01:15:14,454 --> 01:15:23,259
[SPEAKER_05]: With immigration as well as like, yeah, I have a lot of people who are interested in climate change, even friends of mine from Target as well.

873
01:15:24,059 --> 01:15:25,140
[SPEAKER_05]: And like, they're just like,

874
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:28,542
[SPEAKER_05]: scared and they're like, what's going to go?

875
01:15:28,582 --> 01:15:29,363
[SPEAKER_05]: What's going to happen?

876
01:15:29,403 --> 01:15:30,224
[SPEAKER_05]: What's going on?

877
01:15:30,284 --> 01:15:33,167
[SPEAKER_05]: And like, you know, they always ask us to like, how is it?

878
01:15:33,467 --> 01:15:36,891
[SPEAKER_05]: How are like the city like, you know, dealing with it?

879
01:15:37,572 --> 01:15:42,857
[SPEAKER_05]: And in all honesty, it's hard because our information changes like so fast.

880
01:15:43,698 --> 01:15:49,460
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's not a, you know, or like a answer that we can do like, yeah, this is what's happening.

881
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:50,700
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it just stays like that.

882
01:15:50,761 --> 01:15:52,221
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's like every day.

883
01:15:52,261 --> 01:15:59,264
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think like Charbel was saying, maybe we're going to get trainings of that or how to like approach or, you know, talk about it.

884
01:15:59,344 --> 01:16:10,487
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean, I think in these both like huge topics, not to mention DEI is included in it.

885
01:16:10,507 --> 01:16:11,128
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

886
01:16:13,179 --> 01:16:21,526
[SPEAKER_05]: We need more, I think, more awareness and more training for answering questions like that.

887
01:16:21,566 --> 01:16:22,486
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very hard to.

888
01:16:23,387 --> 01:16:30,873
[SPEAKER_05]: But I know that here in Medford, for example, at least for climate change and DEI, we're doing our best.

889
01:16:31,513 --> 01:16:35,076
[SPEAKER_05]: But other than that, for immigration and things like that, it's very hard.

890
01:16:35,477 --> 01:16:36,337
[SPEAKER_05]: Very, very hard.

891
01:16:38,919 --> 01:16:39,640
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.

892
01:16:39,940 --> 01:16:40,901
[SPEAKER_02]: People definitely have

893
01:16:42,842 --> 01:16:45,163
[SPEAKER_02]: bigger things that they're thinking about right now.

894
01:16:45,943 --> 01:16:46,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

895
01:16:47,204 --> 01:16:47,384
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

896
01:16:48,124 --> 01:16:53,946
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm climate wise, you know, what's happening at the federal level is really frustrating.

897
01:16:55,147 --> 01:17:01,109
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to focus as much as possible on our local things we can we can do locally.

898
01:17:03,710 --> 01:17:06,711
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's what we can do while while we're waiting for change.

899
01:17:07,752 --> 01:17:07,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

900
01:17:11,795 --> 01:17:16,197
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, I personally think that this is going to really affect us in the long run.

901
01:17:16,217 --> 01:17:16,197
100%.

902
01:17:18,279 --> 01:17:22,381
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be hard.

903
01:17:22,401 --> 01:17:24,222
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

904
01:17:26,843 --> 01:17:29,144
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the.

905
01:17:30,185 --> 01:17:32,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Funding that funds the.

906
01:17:33,847 --> 01:17:38,029
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the connectors and the liaisons and and all of that, that's a state grant.

907
01:17:38,069 --> 01:17:38,910
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not a federal 1.

908
01:17:40,207 --> 01:17:42,308
[SPEAKER_02]: So that shouldn't be directly affected right now.

909
01:17:43,169 --> 01:17:43,409
[SPEAKER_05]: Nope.

910
01:17:45,330 --> 01:17:45,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Thankfully.

911
01:17:49,492 --> 01:17:56,816
[SPEAKER_02]: But it might be that the state has less funding moving forward because they're not getting as much funding from the federal government.

912
01:17:56,856 --> 01:17:58,837
[SPEAKER_02]: So it might impact things moving forward.

913
01:18:01,138 --> 01:18:05,501
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, I think some of the funding is from a private foundation, actually.

914
01:18:05,621 --> 01:18:08,422
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's less affected, I think.

915
01:18:23,255 --> 01:18:26,157
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it looks like we've come to the end of our agenda.

916
01:18:29,659 --> 01:18:32,261
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any topics that you want to.

917
01:18:32,822 --> 01:18:35,383
[SPEAKER_02]: Put forward for future meetings.

918
01:18:40,927 --> 01:18:43,569
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the green was a green source.

919
01:18:43,589 --> 01:18:45,830
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a good screen score was a good 1.

920
01:18:46,391 --> 01:18:49,973
[SPEAKER_05]: To put the future meeting.

921
01:18:50,689 --> 01:18:53,370
[SPEAKER_02]: What more do you want to find out about the green score?

922
01:18:53,390 --> 01:18:56,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, where's the page?

923
01:18:56,090 --> 01:18:56,811
[SPEAKER_03]: I opened it.

924
01:18:57,071 --> 01:18:58,191
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a question on it.

925
01:18:58,511 --> 01:18:59,691
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God.

926
01:19:00,232 --> 01:19:00,472
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

927
01:19:00,552 --> 01:19:03,753
[SPEAKER_03]: My internet is like super slow.

928
01:19:03,773 --> 01:19:09,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, we lost our bell.

929
01:19:18,885 --> 01:19:19,966
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not my internet.

930
01:19:23,829 --> 01:19:25,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my gosh, it didn't open for me.

931
01:19:26,130 --> 01:19:27,051
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what happened.

932
01:19:27,531 --> 01:19:28,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Did it open or not?

933
01:19:28,572 --> 01:19:28,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on.

934
01:19:29,493 --> 01:19:31,434
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a Word document, right, that you sent?

935
01:19:32,155 --> 01:19:39,100
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I sent a link to a Word document and then also an Excel spreadsheet for the worksheet.

936
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:42,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on.

937
01:19:42,302 --> 01:19:43,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, Brenda.

938
01:19:43,323 --> 01:19:44,944
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like it opened and then it closed.

939
01:19:53,733 --> 01:19:58,876
[SPEAKER_02]: Charbel, I was so worried about making you co-host in case I got bumped and then you got bumped.

940
01:20:01,718 --> 01:20:02,479
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I can't hear you.

941
01:20:02,499 --> 01:20:09,603
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, my laptop started freezing for some reason, so I just switched to my phone.

942
01:20:12,665 --> 01:20:15,287
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

943
01:20:15,307 --> 01:20:15,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

944
01:20:15,948 --> 01:20:19,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you have any suggestions for topics for future meetings?

945
01:20:21,844 --> 01:20:27,367
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't know off the top of my head, but.

946
01:20:29,528 --> 01:20:30,968
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, now I know what I was going to ask.

947
01:20:31,088 --> 01:20:37,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, Brenda, the word, the document that you gave us for like, uh, memorandum and stuff.

948
01:20:37,231 --> 01:20:39,192
[SPEAKER_05]: And it says all like the purpose and overview.

949
01:20:39,512 --> 01:20:44,134
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this something that can be shared to people?

950
01:20:44,194 --> 01:20:44,655
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yes.

951
01:20:44,715 --> 01:20:46,295
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a, this is a public document.

952
01:20:46,816 --> 01:20:47,096
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

953
01:20:47,116 --> 01:20:47,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

954
01:20:47,296 --> 01:20:47,456
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

955
01:20:50,873 --> 01:20:51,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

956
01:20:52,055 --> 01:20:52,857
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I wanted to know.

957
01:20:52,877 --> 01:20:56,563
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if there's another thing.

958
01:20:56,583 --> 01:20:58,286
[SPEAKER_05]: What was this?

959
01:21:01,431 --> 01:21:01,552
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh.

960
01:21:03,735 --> 01:21:12,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm well, I know that like I spoke about it with Catherine, but I don't know if you guys well, you know, you guys weren't in the email.

961
01:21:13,438 --> 01:21:19,099
[SPEAKER_05]: So I got certified for some trainings for environmental and like climate change and stuff.

962
01:21:19,159 --> 01:21:27,882
[SPEAKER_05]: So Catherine has asked me to do like a 10 to 15 page PowerPoint.

963
01:21:28,978 --> 01:21:33,641
[SPEAKER_05]: to talk about what I've learned and stuff like that.

964
01:21:33,741 --> 01:21:50,590
[SPEAKER_05]: And to be honest with you, apart from obviously the stuff that we know, I mean, I feel like this is good for us to know, to be able to share and demonstrate how important it is, climate change.

965
01:21:50,991 --> 01:21:51,811
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I was very,

966
01:21:55,036 --> 01:22:01,929
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of like, I don't know, I guess you can say dumbfounded of how crazy like it's really in depth to the point of like, like.

967
01:22:04,081 --> 01:22:06,862
[SPEAKER_05]: like everything, like I don't even know how to explain it to you.

968
01:22:07,263 --> 01:22:11,885
[SPEAKER_05]: But like, it's something that like, obviously is gonna be with us till forever.

969
01:22:12,005 --> 01:22:13,766
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's something that changes a lot.

970
01:22:14,486 --> 01:22:30,574
[SPEAKER_05]: And I feel like people need to be more, I don't think people understand the severity of it because they just think that it's just all like, things that they just see on the news that's happening, but not really like in depth of how the world works and how climate works and how it affects all of us.

971
01:22:31,354 --> 01:22:37,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, no matter what demographic we come from so.

972
01:22:38,141 --> 01:22:45,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, is this a presentation you're going to be doing it like 1 of your Wednesday meetings or do you want to do it during the climate equity council meeting?

973
01:22:46,898 --> 01:22:53,962
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm doing I think she asked me to do it for one of our meetings, which that's why I was like, I'll just let you know what?

974
01:22:55,142 --> 01:22:59,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, obviously, I need to work on the two presentations I have to work on.

975
01:23:00,025 --> 01:23:02,947
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's gonna take me a little bit of time.

976
01:23:02,967 --> 01:23:06,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, as I'm hearing what I'm going through.

977
01:23:06,208 --> 01:23:07,169
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

978
01:23:07,989 --> 01:23:08,669
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

979
01:23:09,310 --> 01:23:13,092
[SPEAKER_05]: Let you guys know, just pre empty before tomorrow.

980
01:23:13,352 --> 01:23:15,253
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, no, wasn't

981
01:23:16,350 --> 01:23:16,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

982
01:23:16,750 --> 01:23:17,750
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, is it going to be at this?

983
01:23:17,931 --> 01:23:19,471
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not, is it going to be this Wednesday?

984
01:23:19,491 --> 01:23:20,751
[SPEAKER_05]: Not this Wednesday.

985
01:23:20,791 --> 01:23:26,313
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm saying like, I'm going to know about it, that I'm going to be working on it.

986
01:23:26,793 --> 01:23:28,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause that's going to take me some time.

987
01:23:29,714 --> 01:23:30,215
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds good.

988
01:23:30,375 --> 01:23:32,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

989
01:23:33,176 --> 01:23:34,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause it was like seven modules.

990
01:23:34,676 --> 01:23:35,216
[SPEAKER_05]: It was crazy.

991
01:23:35,917 --> 01:23:36,177
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

992
01:23:36,577 --> 01:23:39,418
[SPEAKER_05]: And I followed it because it was so interesting.

993
01:23:40,118 --> 01:23:40,498
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah.

994
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:46,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Other than that.

995
01:23:48,695 --> 01:23:52,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other future topics, guys, before we leave?

996
01:23:55,537 --> 01:23:58,278
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't really think of anything right now, to be honest.

997
01:23:58,779 --> 01:23:59,199
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

998
01:23:59,239 --> 01:24:01,580
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we can follow up over email before the next meeting.

999
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:02,380
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

1000
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:03,060
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1001
01:24:04,901 --> 01:24:07,082
[SPEAKER_05]: So motion to end the meeting, guys?

1002
01:24:09,382 --> 01:24:10,283
[SPEAKER_01]: Motion.

1003
01:24:11,983 --> 01:24:13,444
[SPEAKER_01]: I second this motion.

1004
01:24:17,718 --> 01:24:18,299
[SPEAKER_02]: All in favor?

1005
01:24:18,820 --> 01:24:20,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's a thumbs up from Natasha.

[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1009
01:24:25,171 --> 01:24:25,511
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

1010
01:24:25,712 --> 01:24:26,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, everyone.
