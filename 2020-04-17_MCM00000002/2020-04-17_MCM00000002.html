href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=1710.863">We're</a>  picking up where we left off last week. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=1713.083">I</a>  had put forward a resolution requesting that the city solicitor draft an ordinance of similar fashion that would be considered a tree preservation protection and replacement ordinance. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=1723.985">The</a>  council had expressed some concern relative to the devil being in the details. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=1728.446">As</a>  such, it was a very long meeting as well last week. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=1731.847">I</a>  think we didn't get out of it until about half to 12 o'clock. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=1734.453">So</a>  as such, I decided that it was in the best fashion for the deliberative process to withdraw the paper and to put forward some language, Mr. President. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=1740.778">So</a>  here before us, we have this evening is going to be a launching pad to start a discussion on the regulation of private trees in our community. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=1748.498">And</a>  if we go through the ordinance briefly, we'll have section one, which would be definitions defining, you know, the parameters of applicability, certain exemptions for individuals who'd be exempt. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=1762.007">In</a>  applicability, it would be for, right now in the draft proposal, lots that are equal to or greater than 10,000 square feet, Mr. President. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=1768.391">Those</a>  would be lots that are <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=1770.008">large</a>  enough to be developed for multi-family homes if three families or larger. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=1773.71">I've</a>  also included in this some language relative to an 18-month rolling review period, which would be in line with our demolition delay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=1782.575">We</a>  have a second section related to applicability and the requirements that are going to be asked of individuals that do not have an exempt property. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=1790.799">Also,</a>  there's certain protections in there relative to change of ownership. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=1794.361">If</a>  a lot is clear-cut but the trees are not replaced or the tree farm hasn't been contributed to, <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=1799.714">There's</a>  restrictions and requirements relative to change of ownership. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=1805.756">We</a>  also have the third section, which would be the process and how a permit is going to be issued. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=1816.46">Activities</a>  not requiring a permit, Mr. President, exempt activities that wouldn't require a permit like pruning and emergencies. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=1822.461">Ultimately,</a>  what this ordinance does is it defines what would be a preferably protected tree. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=1827.87">And</a>  then it establishes a criteria to remove it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=1831.031">It's</a>  a launching pad, as I said before. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=1833.052">It's</a>  not the final product. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=1834.613">And</a>  I'd like to ask my council colleagues to indulge me by allowing this paper to be referred to the zoning subcommittee for us to have further deliberations with Go Green Medford, the Forestry Department, and legal counsel for us to come up with a draft that we can all live with, debate, and discuss. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=1851.784">Ultimately,</a>  this paper right here would not be ready to be voted on this evening. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=1854.686">I've</a>  had discussions with our code enforcement officer and there are some areas that are lacking relative to safety concerns. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=1859.468">For</a>  example, last night we had a very windy night. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=1862.609">A</a>  lot of trees were damaged in private residences. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=1865.711">If</a>  a tree is on a private residence on lot A and it's caused damage to lot B based upon the decision of our tree warden or our arborist, then appropriate steps need to be taken to protect that individual's property. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=1876.396">We</a>  have no control in this proposed ordinance to do that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=1879.841">I've</a>  had discussions with Mr. Bavuso. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=1881.542">I've</a>  had discussions with Ms. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=1882.623">Tudin.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=1883.263">I've</a>  had discussions with Mr. Rumley. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=1884.924">I've</a>  had discussions with Mr. Campolis from the Forestry Department as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=1888.366">And</a>  they think that this is a great starting point for a discussion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=1892.089">But</a>  in terms of applicability in Medford, there will need to be changes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=1895.07">That's</a>  why I make the motion to have this sent to the Zoning Subcommittee and then ask my council colleagues to indulge me and such.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=1973.623">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Dello Russo. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=1975.104">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=1976.244">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=1977.345">And</a>  I, too, want to thank my council colleague. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=1980.326">Last</a>  week's motion was to have the city solicitor draft language <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=1986.288">around</a>  a city ordinance, but the language wasn't clear. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=1993.991">There</a>  really wasn't any language, just a direction. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=1997.453">And</a>  clearly we have something to work from now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2000.474">So</a>  this was very helpful and I appreciate the fact that Councilor and I did that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2005.296">As</a>  I stated last week, and I'll state again publicly, Mr. President, on private property of homeowners, I believe homeowners should have the right to remove a tree on private property. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2015.945">If</a>  we're talking about development with large developers that are coming in and declaring land and so forth, I think that's worthy of an ordinance to protect our shade trees and our trees that might be endangered. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2029.859">And</a>  I would support that, Mr. President. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2033.222">I</a>  also want to state an ordinance is great, and we can follow an ordinance. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2038.031">But</a>  we also have to put our money where our mouth is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2041.033">And</a>  in the last several budgets, there is a pittance of money to replace shade trees within our community. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2049.698">And</a>  Aggie Tudin was good enough to respond back. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2053.02">I</a>  believe it was the next day from the council meeting regarding something that Councilor Caraviello brought up about the, if someone buys a tree, the city will match the tree. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2065.562">And</a>  Aggie Toonan came back right away, our tree warden, and said, that's a great program, and it's working. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2070.665">I</a>  mentioned the Back of the Curb program, which I believe at the time, and don't quote me, but there's been a dozen or so trees this year planted on private property that the city will purchase a tree for $500, $600, $700 at the request of the homeowner and plant a tree on private property in areas that <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2093.313">You</a>  probably couldn't put a tree because the sidewalk may be too small. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2097.476">It</a>  may be a tough intersection to put a tree. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2101.198">And</a>  I think that's an important program too that we run, but needs to be funded. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2106.821">So</a>  as part of the ordinance, I'm also going to push in budget time that we increase our funding for our public shade trees within the community too, Mr. President, because I believe they go hand in hand. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2116.647">And</a>  I want to thank my colleague for bringing this up tonight.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2120.189">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2122.045">Point</a>  of clarification, Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2123.925">Mr.</a>  President, one of the key reasons why I brought this thing forward was basically just because of what Councilor Mack said, that we're having a lack of investment in the shade trees. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2133.088">And</a>  one of the key components of the tree replacement zone, the zoning amendment would be that we have a tree replacement fund. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2139.089">So</a>  if private homeowners that take down a preferably protected tree are unable <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2144.462">to</a>  replace it on property, they'll pay into a tree fund to the city and the city will have a revolving account and a funding mechanism to actually purchase shade trees to be used in public lands and as part of the back street, back of the sidewalk program. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2155.689">So</a>  yeah, it's right on the ball. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2157.39">I</a>  think these are some of the issues that we need to vet out, but I think we're really all on the same page in terms of some of the important aspects that we need to put in there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2163.914">So</a>  I thank Councilor Marks for his kind words. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2165.775">And</a>  it was the right course withdrawing and bringing forward language from last week's meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2169.698">So</a>  I'm glad that we had the opportunity to debate that and discuss it and bring this measure forward.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2286.661">I'll</a>  take any title. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2290.404">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2293.747">It</a>  was about two months ago we had a person from the Library Foundation Committee appear before this council. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2302.614">It</a>  was at the request of I think it was Councilor Lungo-Koehn at the time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2306.737">And</a>  the advisor that was hired by the Library Foundation with the mission of raising private funds <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2316.418">to</a>  help with the capital campaign towards a $34 million public library. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2322.441">As</a>  we all remember, the city of Medford was awarded a $12.3 million grant from the Mass Board of Library Commissioners to construct this $34 million library. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2334.467">And</a>  the advisor that appeared before the podium stated, based on their <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2340.143">recent</a>  outreach and discussion among the Library Foundation group and their different outreach, they anticipate to raise about $3.5 million. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2356.989">The</a>  reason why I bring this up, Mr. President, and I mentioned it two months ago that we have a Committee of the Whole meeting, this is a very vital financial economic issue in this community. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2368.373">And</a>  the reason why I bring it up is at the time when we were building a new library, or plans to build a new library, it was mentioned that a $34 million library, based on $12.3 million grant, would leave us paying over $18 million for a balance. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2391.25">And</a>  at the time, it was Mayor Burke that mentioned that she was going to raise privately <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2397.752">the</a>  amount of the grant. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2399.953">So</a>  she was going to go out and raise $12.3 million privately, the amount of the grant. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2404.756">And</a>  this was stated. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2406.276">This</a>  isn't just off the top of my head. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2408.658">It</a>  was stated on two occasions publicly, one during November 2017, that Mayor Burke said she was hopeful donations would be able to match the funds from the state. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2422.137">And</a>  this is her quote, Mr. President. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2424.258">We're</a>  very optimistic from those that have already been interviewed and people that we have reached out to that we'll be able to parlay the state grant, double it with foundation money, and then be left for the city to put up a piece of about $5 million, which is our goal. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2442.085">We</a>  had the foundation advisor appear before us stating $3.5 million was probably an aggressive figure. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2451.948">But</a>  that was what they were looking to raise. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2454.749">And</a>  I asked Barbara Kerr, the library director, when she was at the podium, I stated to her unequivocally, where is the $12.3 million that you're going to raise privately? <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2466.074">And</a>  Barbara Kerr, who has been involved with this library planning from day one, said, oh, I never heard of that figure before. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2474.277">Where</a>  did that figure come from? <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2475.857">And</a>  I said, well, it came from the mayor of this city that it was going to be raised privately. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2480.662">So</a>  that's why I keep on raising the issue, Mr. President, because as time goes on now, and we have yet to hear back from the Library Foundation, and I'm sure they're doing yeoman's work, reaching out to people, trying to gather money, but as time goes on, there's going to be a rather large commitment outstanding for the taxpayers of this community. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2501.391">And</a>  I, as one member of the council, can't turn back to taxpayers and say, you know what? <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2505.873">They</a>  may have made a commitment, but the $12.3 million they may have said they were going to get, they only got $3 million. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2512.457">So</a>  guess what? <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2513.838">You're</a>  going to pay the difference. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2517.199">That</a>  may have been a game changer, Mr. President, at the time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2522.31">So</a>  when you look at the figures, $12.3 million grant, the foundation money that they're saying, just say $3.5, it may be more, it may be less, who knows? <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2530.773">Maybe</a>  they'll raise the whole amount. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2532.354">I</a>  don't know, but I don't get a warm, fuzzy feeling to date regarding the private funds. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2538.056">So</a>  that's $15.8 million. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2541.237">You</a>  take that from the $34 million, it leaves you a balance of $18.2 million. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2550.555">We</a>  have to start discussing this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2552.677">We</a>  should be having, if not weekly, monthly meetings with the library, with the administration, saying, how are we going to pay for this? <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2562.185">And</a>  I don't want to hear, well, year one, we're all set for year one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2565.287">There's</a>  year two. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2566.168">There's</a>  year three, four, five, six. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2568.63">There's</a>  other projects in line, like the fire department, Mr. President, like the high school, like the police station. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2579.547">The</a>  fire station, the plans that were made with the fire station were made based on the fact that private funds were going to be garnered to support this project. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2593.076">Now,</a>  if that doesn't come through, does that push the fire station from year 2024 to 2029, 2030? <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2597.138">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2597.639">And</a>  no one's talking about it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2604.977">But</a>  I'm going to continually bring it up, Mr. President, because it disturbs me when the director of the library that's been involved from day one never recalls a commitment made by the administration of $12.3 million being raised privately. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2618.904">How</a>  do you overlook that as the library director involved from day one? <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2623.926">That's</a>  not a small little fact that you can overlook. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2627.468">That's</a>  huge how you're going to pay for this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2630.069">So</a>  again, Mr. President, respectfully, <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2631.933">I</a>  asked that we have a meeting with the library foundation group that's set up and the library commissioners, I think they should be part of this also. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2641.315">I've</a>  spoken to library commissioners regarding this and they're eager to find out what's going on as well, to be quite honest with you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2650.596">And</a>  we have yet to get an answer from this administration other than the fact, in my opinion, that the mayor is hiding from her original commitment. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2660.853">Now,</a>  if the mayor thinks she was too aggressive at the time, happened to be during a city debate for office, and maybe she was being a little overly aggressive to Ghana support. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2674.5">But</a>  now if that's the case, Mr. President, we still have to make ends meet with this project. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2681.204">And</a>  according to my figures, there's an $18.2 million balance in this project. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2690.145">So</a>  I would ask that we sit up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2691.406">I</a>  know we have a lot of Committee of the Wholes, Mr. President. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2693.346">We</a>  joked about it tonight while we were in a Committee of the Whole meeting with the administration. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2698.389">But</a>  we really need to sit down as a council. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2701.28">because</a>  it was the council that took this vote. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2703.541">This</a>  was a very difficult vote regarding public safety, regarding a new library, which I don't think anyone feels that we didn't need at the time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2711.584">But</a>  we were sold a bill of goods. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2713.925">This</a>  is what's going to happen. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2714.985">This</a>  is how we're going to afford it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2716.526">And</a>  now if this is not how it's going to happen, and this is not how we're going to afford it, we should know how it's going to work. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2724.148">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2726.009">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2727.85">Councilor</a>  Caraviellola.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2729.548">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2731.75">Being</a>  a member of the Library Foundation, I could shine a little bit of light on what's happening in the last couple of meetings. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2739.875">That</a>  3.5 number that Holly Sargent spoke about <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2744.583">The</a>  last time she did it was a few months ago. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2747.085">That's</a>  changed a little bit. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2750.567">She's</a>  had some discussions with some other people that were involved with fundraising and different projects, and I think the expectation of the money raised is going to be different. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2763.595">I</a>  think she'll tell you that when you want to have it for her next report. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2769.538">They've</a>  met with the people from the Museum of Science. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2772.917">who</a>  have been involved with the Bloomberg Foundation, and they've asked us, they've told us that the recommendation was to increase your expectations. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2785.025">That</a>  number is not a number you should be looking at. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2787.707">If</a>  you're looking at a much higher number, then you should be asking for a lot more than what we're asking for. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2792.79">So</a>  I think with that, there's been a little bit of change in the foundation, and you may see some different strategies coming out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2800.315">We've</a>  also, <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2803.438">fine-tuned</a>  the list of local donors from the business community. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2809.239">The</a>  list that was generated before might have been a little generic. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2812.7">So</a>  that's been fine-tuned down to people, you know, real sort of more legitimate sources, you know, taking people off that just came off a general list. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2823.402">And</a>  certain members of the foundation are contacting, you know, people to start bringing, to start, you know, developing this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2832.595">And</a>  probably, maybe in May, if everything goes as expected, they may be able to do their first presentation to some people. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2845.96">Again,</a>  I know the mayor has requested a 3D slide presentation to have. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2851.902">Like</a>  I say, a lot of these are one-time acts, so if you're first time out of the box, it's not a good one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2858.984">You're</a>  not gonna be able to go back. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2861.36">The</a>  foundation is doing a lot of work behind the scenes that people don't know about to hopefully get ready for a May ask of some local people to start on the giving program. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2877.259">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2878.77">And</a>  if you'd like, we can invite Holly to come back at one of the next few meetings, whatever, and say, just give me a little bit of notice, because she lives up in Maine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2888.618">And</a>  she has to go, so she can make the appropriate plans.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2893.942">You</a>  can have her at that committee in the hall. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2895.183">We</a>  can invite her to that.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2897.125">Yes,</a>  Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2899.987">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2900.848">And</a>  I want to thank Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2904.27">If</a>  people aren't aware, Councilor Caraviello was one of the first people to start <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2908.43">speaking</a>  about the poor condition of our public library where our students go. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2912.751">And</a>  I think he was one that first raised many of the concerns with the leaks and so forth. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2917.672">So</a>  I want to thank him for his efforts on this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2921.253">I</a>  just, I don't want people to think for a second that I don't want to see funds raised. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2926.674">I'm</a>  hoping that we raise the full amount. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2929.295">I</a>  just think we should have a contingency plan. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2932.555">And</a>  if that doesn't work out, how are we going to pay for this? <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2936.579">And</a>  it's unfortunate when the mayor can sit back and say, well, if that doesn't work out, we have 60,000 people out here that are going to pay for it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2946.023">That's</a>  not the way we should operate government, Mr. President. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2949.484">And</a>  there should be, if there's none established now, like they're changing the rules on how they're going to raise money and so forth and different ways of raising money, then we should have a contingency plan on how are we going to afford this if the expectations <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2966.466">of</a>  what the mayor stated, the 12.3 matching private money doesn't come through, how are we going to gather that money to pay for this library? <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=2975.893">And</a>  if we can't afford it, what are we going to do, Mr. President, moving forward?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3062.812">What</a>  we've done is they have a generic list of a lot of people in the community. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3068.794">And</a>  a lot of the people that were on that list <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3072.617">were</a>  just – they weren't good people to ask. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3077.464">The</a>  list has been really – not that they weren't good people to ask, but they shouldn't have been on that list. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3084.233">So</a>  the list has been really torn down to some <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3089.535">you</a>  know, businesses that are larger in size that can afford to make the larger donation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3095.417">So,</a>  and, you know, Barry Sloan is, you know, he's making a lot of the calls to those – to the bigger people that, you know, because, you know, he's got that ability that, you know, we don't have. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3107.461">And</a>  other people who – new people on the list. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3109.141">So</a>  the goal is to hopefully have something – hopefully in May, later in May, before the summer, <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3118.068">to</a>  get a feeling onto where we are with this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3121.27">But</a>  I said, when you have Holly come back, I think she'll explain to you what the reasoning was, why the expectation for RASC has gone up from that original number that we had.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3134.736">And</a>  we had the original number of 3.5 million that Holly gave us a few months ago. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3138.918">Is</a>  there a new number that is out there?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3142.86">We</a>  don't have a new number, but there's a different thinking <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3148.412">on</a>  the amount we should be asking for. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3150.573">Rather</a>  than asking for 3.5, we should be asking for a much higher number.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3156.257">And</a>  since that meeting, has the commission now understood that the administration's commitment is the 12.3 million?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3163.941">Are</a>  we hoping to? <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3165.122">The</a>  administration isn't really involved in this, other than that that hasn't been discussed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3171.646">The</a>  mayor's, whatever comment the mayor has said or didn't say, that's not part of the foundation.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3178.897">Will</a>  the library commission be bringing in the administration to hopefully abide by that commitment?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3185.119">It's</a>  not the foundation's job to do that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3188.3">They're</a>  here to raise as much money as possible. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3191.04">It's</a>  a private organization. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3194.241">It</a>  doesn't answer to the city. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3196.622">Its</a>  sole function is to raise as much money as possible for the Medford Public Library. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3203.242">Again,</a>  we don't fall under the auspices of the mayor or anybody else. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3208.764">Anne-Marie</a>  Irwin is on the commission for a little bit of guidance.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3216.286">It</a>  sounds like a lot of these questions probably, which are great questions.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3220.087">But</a>  it's a private organization, and their goal is to raise as much money as possible.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3224.388">What</a>  information, Councilor Marks?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3228.449">I</a>  appreciate you being so candid with us, <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3231.428">If</a>  it's a private organization, why is our treasurer collector, Anne Marie Irwin, sitting on the committee?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3237.41">She's</a>  part of the committee also. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3238.531">She's</a>  been asked to be part of the committee.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3239.751">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3239.951">So</a>  someone from the administration, a city employee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3243.672">I'm</a>  a city employee, so I. Right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3246.213">Is</a>  sitting on this committee, but the mayor has nothing to do with this.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3250.315">Not</a>  really. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3250.695">I</a>  mean, if she wants to come, she can come. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3252.896">But</a>  again, this is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3254.356">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3254.936">We</a>  don't answer to the mayor. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3258.358">Anne</a>  Irwin does. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3259.761">That's</a>  what Ian Irwin does. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3261.282">But</a>  again, the goal of the foundation is to raise as much money as possible.</p>

I'm not hearing that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3297.341">I'm</a>  hearing that... My hope... It's sounding like there's no communication to me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3306.323">But</a>  if there is communication, that's what I'm hoping for, that this commitment by the administration to raise $12.3 million <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3312.923">is</a>  communicated to the foundation, and obviously the administration is helping the foundation raise this money, whether it be everything on top of the 3.5 or that new number, or they're raising the 12.3 and the commission's raising the 3.5 or that new number. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3328.528">We</a>  need to make sure those two groups of people are working together, and obviously the council is apprised of what's going on so that we don't get a bond request, like Councilman Marks said, for $20 million in pushing back the FIFA headquarters. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3343.585">back</a>  to 2030. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3345.226">I</a>  just don't want to see that happen. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3347.247">So</a>  I think it is important that we have a meeting on it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3349.669">I</a>  think it's important that we, maybe every few months, we have, when this representative is here from Maine, that she come to a council meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3359.915">Every</a>  three, four months, come to a council meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3361.916">Even</a>  more than that, if possible, when the ball starts rolling, to give us quarterly updates on where we're at, where we're going, how we foresee things. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3373.11">I</a>  understand maybe nobody was solicited yet, but I have talked to a business or two that has been solicited. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3378.837">A</a>  business owner contacted me.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3926.377">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3928.438">I,</a>  too, want to go on record thanking Councilor Scarpelli, <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3932.575">It</a>  was under his leadership calling for this meeting, getting the players at the table, having DOT sit around the table, having the district office there, not just the people that are responsible for the day-to-day activities, but the engineers from our district, from DOT were present, and people that can make decisions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3954.281">So</a>  it was very helpful to have them there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3956.781">I</a>  think it was insightful, which was offered by Councilor Scarpelli, <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3960.664">The</a>  fact that DOT kept on stating to us they have to adhere to <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3965.486">state</a>  and federal guidelines and regulations regarding signage, regarding traffic lights, and much of which prevents them from doing what we would like to see them do, which is provide some pedestrian safety in that area. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3980.297">And</a>  it was under Councilor Scarpelli's motion that within the next, I think it was 30 or 45 days, that we reconvene with some short-term fixes for that area. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=3993.866">And</a>  I believe they're going to come back with a number of short-term fixes, whether it's a raised crosswalk, whether it's additional signage, whether it's changing that just blinking light to a steady light for the time being. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=4005.212">They're</a>  going to come back with something, Mr. President, in my opinion, that's going to improve that section. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=4011.317">And</a>  I would just put out a challenge to my colleague that that is one intersection. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=4016.2">I</a>  have about another 75 on a list that we need to look at, and I'm sure he'll be eager to take them one at a time.</p>

Yes, it was.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=4072.535">I</a>  don't make enough money for him to switch. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=4079.877">I'll</a>  definitely take it.</p>

    <p>[William O'Keefe]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=4080.637">I</a>  don't know if he wants it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=4085.263">The</a>  city clerk should be seen, but not heard. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=4086.984">I'm</a>  going to make an exception to that tonight. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=4089.526">Council,</a>  I very much appreciate the compliment, but this was your work. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=4092.949">And</a>  I made a couple of phone calls based on expertise and experience I had back at DOT and the T's. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=4098.974">This</a>  was your work. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=4100.495">And</a>  again, I appreciate the compliment, but that was a team effort. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=4105.079">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=4336.412">Mr.</a>  President, the issue really isn't a bus route being added to a street temporarily. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=4344.719">The</a>  issue is that a large amount of traffic that travels over Broadway is going to be diverted through city streets to reroute itself. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=4356.829">That's</a>  the major issue. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=4358.468">And</a>  so the efforts of DOT in planning for this for nearly a year have been to bring that perimeter further and further out so people are diverted out and stay on the highway rather than come through the neighborhoods. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=4374.656">The</a>  communication plan was supposed to have been undertaken by now and I think it's beginning. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=4381.419">If</a>  you notice on the city's website, the announcements are up and DOT <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=4387.822">explained</a>  to us at one of the committee meetings some month or two ago, when we were talking about this, that based on their experience of doing major disruptive projects over the past several years, vis-a-vis bridge work, the bridge work down over in Austin-Brighton, over the Mass Pike, that Commonwealth Ave. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=4412.408">bridge,</a>  there were a couple others, and also the <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=4415.369">What</a>  did they call it, the quick 14 or whatever it was they did here on 93? <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=4420.191">Fast</a>  14. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=4420.831">Was</a>  it the fast 14? <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=4421.932">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=4422.312">Fast</a>  14. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=4424.193">That</a>  they found that doom notifications further out, at a greater distance of time from when the project commences. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=4435.333">was</a>  less successful, it kept it fresh in people's minds that they did it three weeks before the project started. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=4446.301">So</a>  that was part of the rationale for that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=4448.483">But</a>  as far as I lament, as Councilor Scarpelli did, that they didn't do the footwork to tell people that there'd be a bus dump in front of their houses.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=4458.451">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=4460.393">I</a>  mean, the other day they had Hobbit Street shut down for a day, working on some of the gas mains and traffic and parking was diverted to people's houses with limited notice. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=4473.059">There's</a>  been an ongoing for seven months now, repair of a road going on to replace the street to all the pipes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=4482.143">In</a>  fact, they have a trench down the street that's about 10 feet deep right now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/2019-26-02-medford-city-council-meeting_202004&start=4486.225">So</a>  there are disruptions that we all encounter.</p>
