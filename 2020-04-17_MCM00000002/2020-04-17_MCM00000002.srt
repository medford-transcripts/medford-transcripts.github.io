00:00:50,808 --> 00:00:54,007

2
00:01:39,077 --> 00:01:42,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion by Councilor Knight to suspend the rules, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

3
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,460

4
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:43,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

5
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,441
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

00:01:44,461 --> 00:01:45,362
[SPEAKER_03]: The rules are suspended.

7
00:01:45,542 --> 00:01:46,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight.

8
00:01:46,723 --> 00:01:57,851
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, the reason why I request that we suspend the rules is to take up paper 19071, a petition by Shower Rodriguez relative to the Medford Elementary School Citywide PTO announcing the Harlem Wizards game on March 13th.

9
00:01:57,891 --> 00:01:57,951
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

10
00:02:09,904 --> 00:02:23,527
[SPEAKER_03]: Petition's presentation to similar matters 19-071, petition by Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street, Medford, Mass., to address the Medford Elementary Citywide PTO announcing the Harlem Wizards game on March 13th.

11
00:02:24,527 --> 00:02:26,568
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, before you turn the microphone over to Ms.

12
00:02:26,608 --> 00:02:31,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Rodriguez, I do want to make sure that we preface this with the conversation that I had with Ms.

13
00:02:31,429 --> 00:02:36,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Rodriguez and the agreement that we came to was that if I suspend the rules for her to go first, that she would be playing in the game.

14
00:02:36,783 --> 00:02:38,024
[SPEAKER_05]: March 13th.

15
00:02:38,044 --> 00:02:41,286
[SPEAKER_05]: So she's gonna buy a new pair of sneakers and she's gonna be down there on the 13th.

16
00:02:43,187 --> 00:02:46,489
[SPEAKER_03]: If we could please have your name and address for the record, please.

17
00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:49,410
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, Cheryl Rodriguez, 221 Park Street.

18
00:02:49,931 --> 00:02:53,373
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll see Adam Knight, we'll be playing one-on-one before the start of the game.

19
00:02:53,393 --> 00:02:54,093
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll warm up, yep.

20
00:02:54,473 --> 00:02:55,974
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's all get down there.

21
00:02:56,474 --> 00:03:00,737
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm here tonight representing the Medford Citywide Elementary PTO.

22
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:05,983
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a collaboration of the Brooks, Columbus, McGlynn, and the Roberts Elementary School.

23
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:12,167
[SPEAKER_01]: A group of parents got together over the summer and decided to try to work on projects to benefit all of the PTOs.

24
00:03:13,588 --> 00:03:20,572
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is our second community event, and it will be the Harlem Wizards versus the Medford All-Stars.

25
00:03:20,972 --> 00:03:26,156
[SPEAKER_01]: So each elementary school has gathered a team of administrators, staff,

26
00:03:26,876 --> 00:03:29,977
[SPEAKER_01]: teachers that will be playing against the Harlem Wizards.

27
00:03:30,357 --> 00:03:33,378
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to have our own little March Madness on March 13th.

28
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:39,040
[SPEAKER_01]: Wednesday we'll all be in the brand new renovated MHS basketball gym.

29
00:03:40,181 --> 00:03:46,323
[SPEAKER_01]: Doors will open at 6, the game will start at 7, and you'll be able to purchase tickets at harlemwizards.com.

30
00:03:46,683 --> 00:03:51,045
[SPEAKER_01]: This event is open to the entire community and we hope to see a lot of people out there.

31
00:03:51,085 --> 00:03:51,365
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be

32
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,042
[SPEAKER_01]: fun event for everyone.

33
00:03:54,362 --> 00:03:57,045
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be serving pizza for sale, things like that.

34
00:03:57,706 --> 00:04:00,929
[SPEAKER_01]: And it'll just be a great time to see members of the community come out.

35
00:04:01,899 --> 00:04:02,980
[SPEAKER_01]: and check out that new gym.

36
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:07,902
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to thank a few of the people that helped us to make this event possible.

37
00:04:08,362 --> 00:04:11,284
[SPEAKER_01]: The Hyatt here in Medford is providing the lodging for the Wizards.

38
00:04:12,264 --> 00:04:16,246
[SPEAKER_01]: Bill Blumenright presents the Chevalier Theater, sponsoring our t-shirts.

39
00:04:17,127 --> 00:04:25,151
[SPEAKER_01]: Wegmans and McLaughlin Masonry and Boston Sports and Wellness is also helping us to make this event possible.

40
00:04:26,151 --> 00:04:29,833
[SPEAKER_01]: And anyone that buys tickets this week will be entered to win this fabulous basketball.

41
00:04:30,668 --> 00:04:34,534
[SPEAKER_01]: So go to hollandwizards.com to buy tickets and help support your local PTOs.

42
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:35,917
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.

43
00:04:36,398 --> 00:04:36,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

44
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Cheryl, if I may, is the only way to purchase tickets through the website?

45
00:04:43,011 --> 00:04:51,393
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have a limited amount of paper tickets, so people can contact the individual PTOs or myself.

46
00:04:51,973 --> 00:04:54,934
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm sure they can, if they contact the council, someone can get to me.

47
00:04:55,474 --> 00:04:57,534
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can sell paper tickets.

48
00:04:57,694 --> 00:04:59,454
[SPEAKER_01]: The general admission tickets are $15.

49
00:04:59,495 --> 00:05:03,755
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have some available at the door if we're not sold out, and those will be $18.

50
00:05:03,835 --> 00:05:05,496
[SPEAKER_01]: Great, thank you.

51
00:05:05,636 --> 00:05:07,636
[SPEAKER_01]: What time is the game?

52
00:05:07,676 --> 00:05:10,637
[SPEAKER_01]: The game's at 7 on Wednesday, March 13.

53
00:05:13,237 --> 00:05:13,457
[SPEAKER_09]: Second.

54
00:05:13,857 --> 00:05:18,641
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion of Councilor Dello Russo to approve, seconded by Councilor Knight.

55
00:05:18,801 --> 00:05:19,462
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

56
00:05:19,582 --> 00:05:19,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

57
00:05:19,662 --> 00:05:20,242
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

58
00:05:20,662 --> 00:05:21,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion's approved.

59
00:05:22,684 --> 00:05:23,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm sorry.

60
00:05:23,204 --> 00:05:24,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarpelli, I apologize.

61
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:25,466
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not lit up.

62
00:05:25,486 --> 00:05:26,066
[SPEAKER_10]: It's okay.

63
00:05:26,106 --> 00:05:27,628
[SPEAKER_10]: Just, this is a great event.

64
00:05:27,688 --> 00:05:30,310
[SPEAKER_10]: I know it works and other communities have done a great job.

65
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:31,751
[SPEAKER_10]: Just a heads up, Cheryl.

66
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:36,274
[SPEAKER_10]: In a neighboring community, the first alley-oop broke the backboard.

67
00:05:37,525 --> 00:05:39,887
[SPEAKER_10]: And they had to play half-court, three on three.

68
00:05:39,947 --> 00:05:41,848
[SPEAKER_10]: So I know Mr. Maloney's at the high school.

69
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:46,731
[SPEAKER_10]: I know we have the portable nets that maybe just have one available just in case.

70
00:05:47,211 --> 00:05:51,273
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't expect it, but it almost ruined that night.

71
00:05:51,794 --> 00:05:53,395
[SPEAKER_10]: But it was an amazing event.

72
00:05:54,598 --> 00:05:57,679
[SPEAKER_10]: They had about 3,000 seats sold, so, and it's a lot of fun.

73
00:05:57,699 --> 00:05:58,739
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a great family event.

74
00:05:59,099 --> 00:05:59,580
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really fun.

75
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,181
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like, it's now the better version of the Column Globetrotter, so it's a good time.

76
00:06:04,721 --> 00:06:05,822
[SPEAKER_08]: Right here in beautiful Medford.

77
00:06:06,162 --> 00:06:07,202
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, absolutely.

78
00:06:07,562 --> 00:06:07,882
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

79
00:06:08,022 --> 00:06:09,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Alongo-Kern.

80
00:06:09,743 --> 00:06:11,863
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, President Falco.

81
00:06:12,204 --> 00:06:17,425
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to mention the price of the tickets, because Bichero mentioned it at the end, $15 a ticket.

82
00:06:17,945 --> 00:06:23,047
[SPEAKER_08]: That's for general admission seating, and I think any way you sit, you're going to have a good seat, because it is a small arena.

83
00:06:23,572 --> 00:06:30,155
[SPEAKER_08]: So I want to thank Cheryl and the PTO from all four elementary schools for getting this community event together.

84
00:06:30,275 --> 00:06:32,736
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to raise money for the kids' schools.

85
00:06:33,257 --> 00:06:36,778
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the second event that has been put on.

86
00:06:36,818 --> 00:06:43,642
[SPEAKER_08]: The first was the lottery that everybody knows of, the $5,000 for a Disney World Trip that one of Medford's own won.

87
00:06:43,962 --> 00:06:46,663
[SPEAKER_08]: And that raised a great amount of money for the schools.

88
00:06:46,723 --> 00:06:49,685
[SPEAKER_08]: So anything we can do for our kids is fantastic.

89
00:06:49,805 --> 00:06:52,626
[SPEAKER_08]: And thank you to the PTOs for all the hard work they

90
00:06:52,965 --> 00:06:53,225
[SPEAKER_08]: they do.

91
00:06:53,305 --> 00:06:57,549
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be a great night and hopefully a lot of Medford residents show up and support the schools.

92
00:06:58,330 --> 00:06:58,670
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

93
00:06:59,050 --> 00:06:59,871
[SPEAKER_03]: Cheryl, thank you very much.

94
00:06:59,891 --> 00:07:01,633
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you to all the PTOs that are involved.

95
00:07:01,653 --> 00:07:05,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

96
00:07:05,937 --> 00:07:13,263
[SPEAKER_03]: While we're under suspension, Consular Scarpelli.

97
00:07:13,303 --> 00:07:14,004
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

98
00:07:14,024 --> 00:07:14,925
[SPEAKER_10]: If I can go to table

99
00:07:16,126 --> 00:07:22,771
[SPEAKER_10]: items, item 19-037, Victor License for 711-69 Fellsway West Mass.

100
00:07:23,252 --> 00:07:28,676
[SPEAKER_10]: I know the petition has been here for a few weeks and had some questions.

101
00:07:28,736 --> 00:07:29,757
[SPEAKER_10]: We had some issues.

102
00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:34,761
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that one of the concerns is a permit for 24 hours.

103
00:07:35,201 --> 00:07:36,802
[SPEAKER_10]: He's taking that off this evening.

104
00:07:36,822 --> 00:07:37,963
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

105
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, on the motion of Scarpelli that we take

106
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:45,882
[SPEAKER_03]: 19-037 from the table, seconded by Councilor Light.

107
00:07:46,142 --> 00:07:46,863
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

108
00:07:47,323 --> 00:07:47,964
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

109
00:07:49,024 --> 00:07:50,425
[SPEAKER_03]: It is taken from the table.

110
00:07:50,506 --> 00:07:51,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarpelli.

111
00:07:51,386 --> 00:07:52,847
[SPEAKER_10]: Apologize for jumping the gun, Mr. President.

112
00:07:52,887 --> 00:07:53,168
[SPEAKER_03]: No worries.

113
00:07:53,548 --> 00:07:56,490
[SPEAKER_10]: But I know the petitioner's here this evening.

114
00:07:57,431 --> 00:08:06,938
[SPEAKER_10]: He's here tonight just asking for the petition for crime and victim license for the location, not the 24-hour extension.

115
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,840
[SPEAKER_10]: So that is gonna be something separate.

116
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:10,537
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that correct?

117
00:08:10,737 --> 00:08:11,257
[SPEAKER_10]: That's correct.

118
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:16,438
[SPEAKER_12]: Office is already, you know, processed to filling, getting... If we could please have your name and address for the record, please.

119
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:16,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

120
00:08:17,019 --> 00:08:22,260
[SPEAKER_12]: Nadeem Shakur, 69 Bell Sway West, Medford, Massachusetts, and I'm the area rep.

121
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:29,581
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so at the time, Mr. President, we've reviewed and gone over all of the requested information.

122
00:08:30,581 --> 00:08:32,002
[SPEAKER_10]: Everything seems to be in order.

123
00:08:32,402 --> 00:08:35,542
[SPEAKER_10]: I move forward with this portion of the request.

124
00:08:36,542 --> 00:08:37,003
[SPEAKER_10]: In favor.

125
00:08:38,063 --> 00:08:38,963
[SPEAKER_03]: So on the motion of...

126
00:08:40,037 --> 00:08:52,466
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarapelli to approve the common vigil license 711-69 Fellows Way West, Medford, Mass.

127
00:08:53,627 --> 00:08:59,211
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion of Councilor Scarapelli, seconded by Councilor Caraviello, Councilor Knight.

128
00:09:01,593 --> 00:09:02,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

129
00:09:03,114 --> 00:09:06,957
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd request that a 90-day review be placed on this paper by way of amendment, and I'd also ask that

130
00:09:09,028 --> 00:09:10,770
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a convictual license, not a special permit, correct?

131
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:14,093
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the 90-day review we placed on the convictual license.

132
00:09:14,113 --> 00:09:15,554
[SPEAKER_03]: So you'd like to amend for a 90-day review?

133
00:09:15,574 --> 00:09:20,238
[SPEAKER_05]: Just based upon the nature of the business, Mr. President, that we can take a 90-day review on it.

134
00:09:20,258 --> 00:09:22,941
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

135
00:09:22,961 --> 00:09:29,827
[SPEAKER_03]: So on the motion of Consul Escarpelli, seconded by a Consul and I, and amended by a Consul and I, for a 90-day review.

136
00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:33,110
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Secretary, would you please call the roll?

137
00:09:36,734 --> 00:09:37,374
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Caraviello?

138
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:37,614
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

139
00:09:38,274 --> 00:09:38,834
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Dello Russo?

140
00:09:38,855 --> 00:09:39,915
[SPEAKER_13]: Affirmative.

141
00:09:39,935 --> 00:09:40,415
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight?

142
00:09:40,715 --> 00:09:40,915
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

143
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:42,355

00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:44,896
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Scarpelli?

148
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:45,596
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

149
00:09:45,616 --> 00:09:46,276

00:11:17,205 --> 00:11:23,429
[SPEAKER_03]: The Committee of the Whole referred the hearing back to City Council on February 13th, 2019.

165
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:30,914
[SPEAKER_03]: Petition and plan may be seen in the office of the City Clerk, Medford City Hall, Medford, Massachusetts.

176

[SPEAKER_12]: Sure, it's Bill O'Keefe, Kilgore Ave, Method Mass.

178
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,341
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. O'Keefe.

179
00:12:34,881 --> 00:12:35,382
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone else?

180
00:12:35,882 --> 00:12:39,245
[SPEAKER_03]: that has not spoken previously that is not in favor of this petition.

181
00:12:41,567 --> 00:12:46,551
[SPEAKER_03]: Hearing and seeing none, this part of the hearing is closed.

182
00:12:49,133 --> 00:12:53,316
[SPEAKER_03]: At this point, I'll call upon the chairperson of licensing, Consular Scarpelli.

183
00:12:53,336 --> 00:12:56,179
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

184
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,083
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that the petitioner isn't here this evening.

185
00:13:02,744 --> 00:13:03,685
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we have

186
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:07,913
[SPEAKER_10]: We have reached out to different departments.

187
00:13:07,933 --> 00:13:24,447
[SPEAKER_10]: There were some questions that were brought up in a subcommittee meeting in regards of the licensing departments, the approving departments, giving the proper information needed to approve.

188
00:13:25,768 --> 00:13:30,692
[SPEAKER_10]: We've talked to both FIRE and Mr. Moki in the building department.

189
00:13:31,312 --> 00:13:34,415
[SPEAKER_10]: And they were under the impression that this

190
00:13:35,187 --> 00:13:42,032
[SPEAKER_10]: request was only for a used car dealership for the outside of the premises, not on the inside.

191
00:13:43,613 --> 00:14:01,427
[SPEAKER_10]: So at this time, I would declare this to be a petition that's not in good standing in the fact that what's being asked now is to house

192
00:14:02,615 --> 00:14:05,217
[SPEAKER_10]: automobiles with gasoline tanks in the facility.

193
00:14:05,658 --> 00:14:12,164
[SPEAKER_10]: What we were told is that Mr. Mulkey himself told me that what would be needed would be

194
00:14:13,518 --> 00:14:24,725
[SPEAKER_10]: retrofitted walls that are fire safe and so many other variables that he wouldn't have approved that scenario.

195
00:14:25,446 --> 00:14:38,453
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I know that other council might have talked to the fire department, but with that said, I think this should go back to the petitioner and refiled with the proper documentation.

196
00:14:41,475 --> 00:14:42,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Scott Belli.

197
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:43,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight.

198
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,300
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

199
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:49,881
[SPEAKER_05]: With the petitioner is not present this evening, I don't feel as though it would be appropriate for us to take a vote with him not here.

200
00:14:50,521 --> 00:14:58,043
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that being said, I'd request that this matter be moved to the 3-12 agenda for a council vote on the special permit, with notice being given to the gentleman that he's requested to appear.

201
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:03,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Failure to appear will result in the council voting for his permit without him present.

202
00:15:03,363 --> 00:15:05,064
[SPEAKER_05]: But at this point in time, the gentleman's not here.

203
00:15:05,964 --> 00:15:12,925
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'd ask that we continue the matter for three weeks and allow the gentleman the opportunity to come here and be available to us when we take this vote.

204
00:15:14,165 --> 00:15:19,189
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion of Councilor Knight to move this to a date certain, which would be March 12th, 2019.

205
00:15:19,969 --> 00:15:22,631
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarpelli.

206
00:15:24,572 --> 00:15:25,933
[SPEAKER_10]: I second that, Mr. President.

207
00:15:26,534 --> 00:15:28,255
[SPEAKER_10]: Supporting Councilor Knight, I think that's appropriate.

208
00:15:28,956 --> 00:15:31,638
[SPEAKER_10]: I think Mr. Akutera is very confused with this whole proceeding.

209
00:15:31,678 --> 00:15:35,080
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that we wait for him to explain and move forward with it.

210
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:35,300
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.

211
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,501
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

212
00:15:37,322 --> 00:15:38,422
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Longo.

213
00:15:38,462 --> 00:15:39,503
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, President Falco.

214
00:15:39,543 --> 00:15:42,765
[SPEAKER_08]: And in the meantime, if we could just get a written update from

215
00:15:44,325 --> 00:15:51,009
[SPEAKER_08]: Building Commissioner Moki, I think that's very important information and information that we didn't have at last week's meeting.

216
00:15:51,089 --> 00:16:00,975
[SPEAKER_08]: I know there was questions with regards to the fire department as well, not knowing the logistics of the license request.

217
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:12,621
[SPEAKER_08]: And one of my two concerns was housing vehicles in the building, although it was dissuaded a little bit because

218
00:16:13,802 --> 00:16:18,364
[SPEAKER_08]: other unit owners at times have a vehicle here and there in the building.

219
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:21,285
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, I was just confused on that matter.

220
00:16:21,445 --> 00:16:32,790
[SPEAKER_08]: But hearing from the building department and possibly the fire department on the logistics of the application would be very helpful in determining, especially where there's a safety issue involved.

221
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:33,730
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd appreciate that.

222
00:16:35,331 --> 00:16:40,293
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Longo, I just want to make sure, do you want to get a report back from the building department?

223
00:16:40,775 --> 00:16:46,357
[SPEAKER_08]: Just, yeah, there was mention of Councilor Scarpelli doing his due diligence and speaking to the building department.

224
00:16:46,377 --> 00:16:51,239
[SPEAKER_08]: I just also would like to see that in writing, because I didn't speak to the building department.

225
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,380
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarpelli.

226
00:16:54,641 --> 00:16:58,703
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a great point brought up that if we could get a report back from Mr. Moki.

227
00:16:59,203 --> 00:17:07,446
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe the difference, the question was, I think that Councilor Langley-Curran brought this up a few times, that if there were propane, why couldn't there be the gas?

228
00:17:07,506 --> 00:17:08,867
[SPEAKER_10]: That was the big question.

229
00:17:09,512 --> 00:17:14,656
[SPEAKER_10]: what he was explaining to us, it's two totally different scenarios and requirements.

230
00:17:14,696 --> 00:17:20,459
[SPEAKER_10]: So if Mr. Moki can just share that with us so that's on the record, that'd be perfect.

231
00:17:20,499 --> 00:17:20,820
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

232
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,300
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

233
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:21,780
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

234
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,402
[SPEAKER_08]: And if I may, just... Yes, Vice President.

235
00:17:24,622 --> 00:17:34,649
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that is important because if you have... I know there's churches in that building and a number of other people that work there day in and day out.

236
00:17:34,689 --> 00:17:38,892
[SPEAKER_08]: And to have any exhaust, whether that's propane or gas or anything that's...

237
00:17:39,763 --> 00:17:58,457
[SPEAKER_08]: worrisome in the building, it would be nice to know the difference of why propane is maybe okay, and why gas isn't, for the council to, in case we ever have to examine this specific petition in the future, or any others that have to do with any type of vehicles in the building, that's concerning in general.

238
00:17:58,797 --> 00:17:59,077
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

239
00:17:59,297 --> 00:18:00,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

240
00:18:00,998 --> 00:18:03,380
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion, Councilor Caraviello.

241
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,962
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President, is there a reason why the petitioner is not here this evening?

242
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:08,620
[SPEAKER_03]: I have not received any notification.

243
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,281
[SPEAKER_06]: Was he notified to be here this evening?

244
00:18:11,262 --> 00:18:11,422
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

245
00:18:13,864 --> 00:18:14,284
[SPEAKER_13]: Was he notified?

246
00:18:14,585 --> 00:18:16,446
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, he was notified he was going to be here this evening.

247
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:27,975
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion of Council and I, seconded by Councilor Scarapelli, that this hearing be moved to a date certain, March 12, 2019.

248
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:31,377
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

249
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:32,378
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

250
00:18:34,091 --> 00:18:36,712
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight and Councilor Caraviello, please mark in opposition.

251
00:18:37,332 --> 00:18:37,913
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize.

252
00:18:37,993 --> 00:18:41,634
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Marks and Councilor Caraviello, please mark them in opposition.

253
00:18:45,236 --> 00:18:46,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Dello Russo.

254
00:18:47,156 --> 00:18:52,059
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd just like the record to be shown that the microphone system is still in disrepair.

255
00:18:52,519 --> 00:18:53,499
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.

256
00:18:54,019 --> 00:18:59,442
[SPEAKER_03]: That was actually on one of our priority lists that we did not get to tonight, so that will be at the next Committee of the Whole.

257
00:19:00,612 --> 00:19:05,415
[SPEAKER_04]: because in the winter they can't be, the wires don't fix as they would in the springtime.

258
00:19:06,636 --> 00:19:15,121
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

259
00:19:15,661 --> 00:19:17,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Motions, orders and resolutions.

260
00:19:17,862 --> 00:19:22,545
[SPEAKER_03]: 19-060 offered by Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

261
00:19:23,145 --> 00:19:29,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Be it resolved that the administration update the Medford City Council regarding negotiations with Tufts University

262
00:19:29,677 --> 00:19:30,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

263
00:19:31,998 --> 00:19:33,679
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, President Falco.

264
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:55,571
[SPEAKER_08]: With regards to Tufts University, there's been, I believe, two or three agreements since I've been a city councilor over the last several years with regards to money, agreements with regards to money in lieu of taxes that has been given to the city.

265
00:19:55,631 --> 00:19:58,132
[SPEAKER_08]: And I believe that the administration is

266
00:19:58,928 --> 00:20:00,328
[SPEAKER_08]: negotiating currently.

267
00:20:00,388 --> 00:20:02,729
[SPEAKER_08]: That is what I'm under the understanding.

268
00:20:02,789 --> 00:20:07,611
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'd just like to see if that negotiation is complete, if anybody has any information on that.

269
00:20:08,011 --> 00:20:09,211
[SPEAKER_08]: We haven't been apprised.

270
00:20:09,671 --> 00:20:13,913
[SPEAKER_08]: I know negotiations sometimes are not involved, but it is important.

271
00:20:13,973 --> 00:20:19,354
[SPEAKER_08]: People ask me as a Councilor all the time, and I'm sure my colleagues, you know, what is Tufts doing for us?

272
00:20:19,454 --> 00:20:26,857
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you go online or do any research, you'll see all the different things that they do help the city with.

273
00:20:26,937 --> 00:20:27,757
[SPEAKER_08]: Community Day,

274
00:20:29,205 --> 00:20:31,666
[SPEAKER_08]: going into the schools and doing certain programs.

275
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:39,927
[SPEAKER_08]: They give donations back to the Royal House, the Brooks Estates, Chamber of Commerce, Historical Society.

276
00:20:39,987 --> 00:20:53,089
[SPEAKER_08]: But my resolution really has to do with the lump sum that has been contracted to be given to the city from Tufts University pretty much since early 2000s that I'm aware of.

277
00:20:53,149 --> 00:20:57,270
[SPEAKER_08]: So I want to know what is the administration doing to make sure we continue that

278
00:20:57,825 --> 00:21:02,608
[SPEAKER_08]: And has there been any discussion what has been discussed?

279
00:21:02,709 --> 00:21:06,491
[SPEAKER_08]: And when should we expect finality of a new agreement?

280
00:21:07,412 --> 00:21:07,732
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

281
00:21:07,752 --> 00:21:08,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

282
00:21:09,733 --> 00:21:11,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight.

283
00:21:11,074 --> 00:21:13,476
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, I thank Councilor Lungo for bringing this forward.

284
00:21:13,496 --> 00:21:23,423
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that payment in lieu of tax agreements is something that are very important for us here in the community because it allows us the opportunity to capture non-tax revenue and to capture that revenue in a reoccurring fashion.

285
00:21:24,024 --> 00:21:27,246
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I'd like to amend the paper and also request that

286
00:21:27,951 --> 00:21:29,992
[SPEAKER_05]: the city administration report back to the council.

287
00:21:30,432 --> 00:21:40,257
[SPEAKER_05]: If they have identified any property owning non-profit tax exempt properties, they can also approach to discuss whether or not we can implement a payment of lieu of taxes program with them as well.

288
00:21:41,077 --> 00:21:41,437
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

289
00:21:43,298 --> 00:21:46,779
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion of Vice President Lungo-Koehn, seconded by Councilor Knight.

290
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:47,960
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

291
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:48,040
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

292
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,021
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

293
00:21:49,361 --> 00:21:52,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

294
00:21:52,062 --> 00:21:54,283
[SPEAKER_03]: 19-061 offered by Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

295
00:21:54,813 --> 00:22:02,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Be it resolved that the administration update the Medford City Council with regards to the details of the lawsuit filed against the Sackler family.

296
00:22:03,096 --> 00:22:04,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

297
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:05,877
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, President Falco.

298
00:22:05,917 --> 00:22:18,902
[SPEAKER_08]: This press release came out February 11th with regards to the city filing a public nuisance lawsuit in the United States District Court against pharmaceutical drug manufacturers.

299
00:22:19,162 --> 00:22:22,323
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's a one and a half page

300
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:34,733
[SPEAKER_08]: press release, which is just something that I'm interested in learning more about as far as the budget's concerned, as far as the specifics of the lawsuit.

301
00:22:34,874 --> 00:22:49,438
[SPEAKER_08]: I know breach of their duties to detect or report suspicious orders of prescription opiates is part of the complaint, but I would like to see if we could get a copy of the actual complaint that was filed.

302
00:22:49,983 --> 00:23:04,576
[SPEAKER_08]: and also just get any other information such as what has been, if this is a contingent fee or have we given a retainer to the law office that is handling this for the city, and if so, how much is that retainer?

303
00:23:04,636 --> 00:23:06,237
[SPEAKER_08]: How much do we expect this to cost?

304
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,339
[SPEAKER_08]: What do we expect to be the outcome?

305
00:23:08,659 --> 00:23:13,243
[SPEAKER_08]: Will we be helping Medford families get reimbursement?

306
00:23:13,884 --> 00:23:15,866
[SPEAKER_08]: I just would like to know the logistics of this.

307
00:23:16,226 --> 00:23:17,247
[SPEAKER_08]: People are asking me,

308
00:23:18,385 --> 00:23:32,789
[SPEAKER_08]: Since the press release has gone out since February 11th, and I don't have the answers except for what's in this press release, because I think something was out a year ago that spoke of it, but not much more detail than what's in the press release.

309
00:23:32,849 --> 00:23:38,710
[SPEAKER_08]: And as a Councilor who will be voting on the budget in June, I want to know how this affects, you know, how this affects the budget.

310
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,710
[SPEAKER_08]: Are we talking a $5,000 retainer or $50,000?

311
00:23:43,785 --> 00:23:47,448
[SPEAKER_08]: relevant to the budget, and I want to know more about it on many different levels.

312
00:23:47,688 --> 00:23:47,989
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

313
00:23:48,269 --> 00:23:49,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

314
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:50,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Dello Russo.

315
00:23:51,091 --> 00:23:51,972
[SPEAKER_03]: I've changed my mind.

316
00:23:53,193 --> 00:23:54,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Dello Russo.

317
00:23:54,814 --> 00:23:57,456
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion of Vice President Lungo-Koehn, seconded by Councilor Knight.

318
00:23:57,636 --> 00:23:58,397
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

319
00:23:58,417 --> 00:23:58,617
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

320
00:23:58,657 --> 00:23:59,397
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

321
00:23:59,558 --> 00:24:03,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

322
00:24:03,601 --> 00:24:03,921
[SPEAKER_03]: 19-069.

323
00:24:06,463 --> 00:24:07,944
[SPEAKER_03]: Offered by Councilor Caraviellola.

324
00:24:08,304 --> 00:24:12,868
[SPEAKER_03]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council have the Code Enforcement Officers send literature

325
00:24:13,309 --> 00:24:19,674
[SPEAKER_03]: to all retail establishments, informing them of the signed ordinances in time frame for enforcement.

326
00:24:20,855 --> 00:24:21,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Caraviello.

327
00:24:22,877 --> 00:24:23,637
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

328
00:24:23,657 --> 00:24:41,232
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President, you know, as we get more and more visitors coming to the city with the Chevalier Auditorium and other things happening here, one of the complaints I hear from many, even our own residents, is our signed ordinances is just not even been enforced at all.

329
00:24:42,226 --> 00:24:46,108
[SPEAKER_06]: More and more stores, the windows are just totally full, signs everywhere.

330
00:24:47,829 --> 00:24:55,094
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it's about time that, and as I said, I know that our enforcement department is cut thin as it is.

331
00:24:55,154 --> 00:25:05,260
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it's about time that we send out literature to all these business owners throughout the city, letting them know what our sign ordinance is.

332
00:25:06,567 --> 00:25:12,391
[SPEAKER_06]: give them some type of time frame for when we'll be able to enforce them.

333
00:25:12,751 --> 00:25:16,614
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the good weather's coming out and people are going to be starting walking the streets again.

334
00:25:17,515 --> 00:25:19,276
[SPEAKER_06]: The windows of these stores are deplorable.

335
00:25:19,897 --> 00:25:21,818
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just full of literature and signs.

336
00:25:23,099 --> 00:25:29,463
[SPEAKER_06]: Not that we want to be anti-business, but the curb appeal of our city is going down.

337
00:25:30,364 --> 00:25:33,826
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's about time that we step up and start cleaning up the windows

338
00:25:34,903 --> 00:25:36,584
[SPEAKER_06]: and making them look a lot better than what they are.

339
00:25:37,164 --> 00:25:46,549
[SPEAKER_06]: So they say, if I could ask the building department to send it out and give them 60 days, 90 days to conform.

340
00:25:47,049 --> 00:25:50,931
[SPEAKER_06]: If they don't conform, then I think it's about time that we find them.

341
00:25:51,151 --> 00:25:57,874
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you go out throughout the whole city, there's probably 90% of the businesses are in violation.

342
00:25:59,635 --> 00:26:00,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

343
00:26:01,036 --> 00:26:01,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight.

344
00:26:02,086 --> 00:26:08,009
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, I'd like to request that the Code Enforcement Officer also visit Lawrence Memorial Hospital for compliance with the sign ordinance.

345
00:26:08,129 --> 00:26:14,151
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been brought to my attention by a number of neighbors that a temporary sign has been erected that's in violation of our sign ordinance.

346
00:26:14,631 --> 00:26:30,418
[SPEAKER_05]: It's causing blight and eyesore for the residents in the neighborhood, and they've requested that the Code Enforcement Officer make a visit over to Lawrence Memorial Hospital and remind them of the criteria that's included in our sign ordinance, one of them being a special permit from the City Council for a sign that is outside the scope of our ordinance.

347
00:26:31,701 --> 00:26:32,561
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

348
00:26:34,382 --> 00:26:35,963
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion by Councilor Caraviello.

349
00:26:38,124 --> 00:26:38,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Marks.

350
00:26:40,305 --> 00:26:58,452
[SPEAKER_09]: Just if I could, on line with Councilor Caraviello, I would just ask also if we can send a letter to the Chamber of Commerce and maybe we can work through the Chamber of Commerce to have them alert their business owners regarding the sign ordinance.

351
00:26:58,972 --> 00:27:00,013
[SPEAKER_09]: And if anyone needs

352
00:27:00,707 --> 00:27:08,012
[SPEAKER_09]: to be enlightened on what the current, because the sign on ordinances is rather lengthy and new businesses may not be that familiar with it.

353
00:27:08,512 --> 00:27:21,460
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would ask as a first step that we also send a letter to the president of the chamber asking that they contact their membership also about adhering to the local sign ordinance.

354
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds good.

355
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,221
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

356
00:27:24,481 --> 00:27:27,103
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion of Councilor Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Knight,

357
00:27:27,685 --> 00:27:29,787
[SPEAKER_03]: as amended by Councilor Knight and Councilor Marks.

358
00:27:30,047 --> 00:27:30,708
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

359
00:27:30,728 --> 00:27:30,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

360
00:27:31,208 --> 00:27:31,828
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

361
00:27:32,189 --> 00:27:37,913
[SPEAKER_03]: The motion passes.

362
00:27:37,933 --> 00:27:39,895
[SPEAKER_03]: 19-070, offered by Councilor Knight.

363
00:27:41,256 --> 00:27:44,359
[SPEAKER_03]: Be it so ordained, Medford City Council adopt the following ordinance.

364
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:47,721
[SPEAKER_03]: Tree preservation, protection, and replacement ordinance.

365
00:27:48,482 --> 00:27:50,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Findings, intent, and purpose.

366
00:27:50,143 --> 00:27:54,567
[SPEAKER_03]: The City Council has determined that many trees are being lost without replacement.

367
00:27:56,532 --> 00:28:06,715
[SPEAKER_03]: to demolition of existing buildings in order to construct new buildings and lot clearing in connection with the construction of new buildings on previously undeveloped land.

368
00:28:07,535 --> 00:28:13,417
[SPEAKER_03]: The city council has further determined that trees have been lost, severely damaged, or disfigured.

369
00:28:13,617 --> 00:28:19,898
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, move to waive the reading and if a brief synopsis could be given.

370
00:28:20,278 --> 00:28:23,859
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion of Council Marks to waive the reading for brief synopsis.

371
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:25,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Given by council and I. Proposed.

372
00:28:29,363 --> 00:28:30,623
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

373
00:28:30,863 --> 00:28:32,623
[SPEAKER_05]: We're picking up where we left off last week.

374
00:28:33,083 --> 00:28:43,245
[SPEAKER_05]: I had put forward a resolution requesting that the city solicitor draft an ordinance of similar fashion that would be considered a tree preservation protection and replacement ordinance.

375
00:28:43,985 --> 00:28:47,586
[SPEAKER_05]: The council had expressed some concern relative to the devil being in the details.

376
00:28:48,446 --> 00:28:51,807
[SPEAKER_05]: As such, it was a very long meeting as well last week.

377
00:28:51,847 --> 00:28:53,807
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we didn't get out of it until about half to 12 o'clock.

378
00:28:54,453 --> 00:29:00,418
[SPEAKER_05]: So as such, I decided that it was in the best fashion for the deliberative process to withdraw the paper and to put forward some language, Mr. President.

379
00:29:00,778 --> 00:29:07,863
[SPEAKER_05]: So here before us, we have this evening is going to be a launching pad to start a discussion on the regulation of private trees in our community.

380
00:29:08,498 --> 00:29:20,846
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we go through the ordinance briefly, we'll have section one, which would be definitions defining, you know, the parameters of applicability, certain exemptions for individuals who'd be exempt.

381
00:29:22,007 --> 00:29:28,331
[SPEAKER_05]: In applicability, it would be for, right now in the draft proposal, lots that are equal to or greater than 10,000 square feet, Mr. President.

382
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:29,492
[SPEAKER_05]: Those would be lots that are

383
00:29:30,008 --> 00:29:33,010
[SPEAKER_05]: large enough to be developed for multi-family homes if three families or larger.

384
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:41,414
[SPEAKER_05]: I've also included in this some language relative to an 18-month rolling review period, which would be in line with our demolition delay.

385
00:29:42,575 --> 00:29:49,139
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a second section related to applicability and the requirements that are going to be asked of individuals that do not have an exempt property.

386
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:54,281
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, there's certain protections in there relative to change of ownership.

387
00:29:54,361 --> 00:29:58,884
[SPEAKER_05]: If a lot is clear-cut but the trees are not replaced or the tree farm hasn't been contributed to,

388
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:02,835
[SPEAKER_05]: There's restrictions and requirements relative to change of ownership.

389
00:30:05,756 --> 00:30:10,878
[SPEAKER_05]: We also have the third section, which would be the process and how a permit is going to be issued.

390
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:22,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Activities not requiring a permit, Mr. President, exempt activities that wouldn't require a permit like pruning and emergencies.

391
00:30:22,461 --> 00:30:27,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Ultimately, what this ordinance does is it defines what would be a preferably protected tree.

392
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:30,011
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it establishes a criteria to remove it.

393
00:30:31,031 --> 00:30:32,992
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a launching pad, as I said before.

394
00:30:33,052 --> 00:30:34,253
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not the final product.

395
00:30:34,613 --> 00:30:50,980
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'd like to ask my council colleagues to indulge me by allowing this paper to be referred to the zoning subcommittee for us to have further deliberations with Go Green Medford, the Forestry Department, and legal counsel for us to come up with a draft that we can all live with, debate, and discuss.

396
00:30:51,784 --> 00:30:54,626
[SPEAKER_05]: Ultimately, this paper right here would not be ready to be voted on this evening.

397
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:59,408
[SPEAKER_05]: I've had discussions with our code enforcement officer and there are some areas that are lacking relative to safety concerns.

398
00:30:59,468 --> 00:31:02,149
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, last night we had a very windy night.

399
00:31:02,609 --> 00:31:04,750
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of trees were damaged in private residences.

400
00:31:05,711 --> 00:31:16,296
[SPEAKER_05]: If a tree is on a private residence on lot A and it's caused damage to lot B based upon the decision of our tree warden or our arborist, then appropriate steps need to be taken to protect that individual's property.

401
00:31:16,396 --> 00:31:19,137
[SPEAKER_05]: We have no control in this proposed ordinance to do that.

402
00:31:19,841 --> 00:31:21,522
[SPEAKER_05]: I've had discussions with Mr. Bavuso.

403
00:31:21,542 --> 00:31:22,583
[SPEAKER_05]: I've had discussions with Ms.

404
00:31:22,623 --> 00:31:22,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Tudin.

405
00:31:23,263 --> 00:31:24,704
[SPEAKER_05]: I've had discussions with Mr. Rumley.

406
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:27,926
[SPEAKER_05]: I've had discussions with Mr. Campolis from the Forestry Department as well.

407
00:31:28,366 --> 00:31:31,748
[SPEAKER_05]: And they think that this is a great starting point for a discussion.

408
00:31:32,089 --> 00:31:34,770
[SPEAKER_05]: But in terms of applicability in Medford, there will need to be changes.

409
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:39,553
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I make the motion to have this sent to the Zoning Subcommittee and then ask my council colleagues to indulge me and such.

410
00:31:40,174 --> 00:31:41,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

411
00:31:41,754 --> 00:31:42,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Dello Russo.

412
00:31:42,735 --> 00:31:46,417
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, I welcome Councilor Knight's

413
00:31:48,491 --> 00:32:06,179
[SPEAKER_04]: effort in this matter, he's clearly, as he always does, as he always does, researched this subject matter and placed necessary hours in working on this, and also reaching out to people who are pertinent to these matters, all wonderful qualities of a city councilor.

414
00:32:06,739 --> 00:32:15,763
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I equally regard his wisdom to move this to an appropriate committee so that we might have more fruitful and detailed discussion

415
00:32:16,285 --> 00:32:21,448
[SPEAKER_04]: because bogging down such discussion on the council's floor might become tedious and burdensome.

416
00:32:22,089 --> 00:32:36,338
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd also like to point out that there are so many items in this that I'd like to discuss in great detail with regards to legalities, appropriateness, life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness.

417
00:32:36,916 --> 00:32:45,199
[SPEAKER_04]: that I look forward to having a robust and rich discussion on this matter so that people's interests might truly be protected, Mr. President.

418
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:52,823
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want to, again, express my gratitude to the councilor for the outstanding job he's done in the preparation of this document.

419
00:32:53,623 --> 00:32:54,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Dello Russo.

420
00:32:55,104 --> 00:32:55,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Marks.

421
00:32:56,244 --> 00:32:57,204
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

422
00:32:57,345 --> 00:32:59,405
[SPEAKER_09]: And I, too, want to thank my council colleague.

423
00:33:00,326 --> 00:33:05,508
[SPEAKER_09]: Last week's motion was to have the city solicitor draft language

424
00:33:06,288 --> 00:33:13,691
[SPEAKER_09]: around a city ordinance, but the language wasn't clear.

425
00:33:13,991 --> 00:33:16,872
[SPEAKER_09]: There really wasn't any language, just a direction.

426
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:19,974
[SPEAKER_09]: And clearly we have something to work from now.

427
00:33:20,474 --> 00:33:24,576
[SPEAKER_09]: So this was very helpful and I appreciate the fact that Councilor and I did that.

428
00:33:25,296 --> 00:33:35,340
[SPEAKER_09]: As I stated last week, and I'll state again publicly, Mr. President, on private property of homeowners, I believe homeowners should have the right to remove a tree on private property.

429
00:33:35,945 --> 00:33:49,198
[SPEAKER_09]: If we're talking about development with large developers that are coming in and declaring land and so forth, I think that's worthy of an ordinance to protect our shade trees and our trees that might be endangered.

430
00:33:49,859 --> 00:33:52,862
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would support that, Mr. President.

431
00:33:53,222 --> 00:33:57,507
[SPEAKER_09]: I also want to state an ordinance is great, and we can follow an ordinance.

432
00:33:58,031 --> 00:34:00,372
[SPEAKER_09]: But we also have to put our money where our mouth is.

433
00:34:01,033 --> 00:34:08,877
[SPEAKER_09]: And in the last several budgets, there is a pittance of money to replace shade trees within our community.

434
00:34:09,698 --> 00:34:12,600
[SPEAKER_09]: And Aggie Tudin was good enough to respond back.

435
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:24,527
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe it was the next day from the council meeting regarding something that Councilor Caraviello brought up about the, if someone buys a tree, the city will match the tree.

436
00:34:25,562 --> 00:34:30,245
[SPEAKER_09]: And Aggie Toonan came back right away, our tree warden, and said, that's a great program, and it's working.

437
00:34:30,665 --> 00:34:52,940
[SPEAKER_09]: I mentioned the Back of the Curb program, which I believe at the time, and don't quote me, but there's been a dozen or so trees this year planted on private property that the city will purchase a tree for $500, $600, $700 at the request of the homeowner and plant a tree on private property in areas that

438
00:34:53,313 --> 00:34:57,436
[SPEAKER_09]: You probably couldn't put a tree because the sidewalk may be too small.

439
00:34:57,476 --> 00:34:59,897
[SPEAKER_09]: It may be a tough intersection to put a tree.

440
00:35:01,198 --> 00:35:06,301
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that's an important program too that we run, but needs to be funded.

441
00:35:06,821 --> 00:35:16,127
[SPEAKER_09]: So as part of the ordinance, I'm also going to push in budget time that we increase our funding for our public shade trees within the community too, Mr. President, because I believe they go hand in hand.

442
00:35:16,647 --> 00:35:18,588
[SPEAKER_09]: And I want to thank my colleague for bringing this up tonight.

443
00:35:20,189 --> 00:35:21,270
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

444
00:35:22,045 --> 00:35:23,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Point of clarification, Councilor Knight.

445
00:35:23,925 --> 00:35:32,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, one of the key reasons why I brought this thing forward was basically just because of what Councilor Mack said, that we're having a lack of investment in the shade trees.

446
00:35:33,088 --> 00:35:38,969
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the key components of the tree replacement zone, the zoning amendment would be that we have a tree replacement fund.

447
00:35:39,089 --> 00:35:43,950
[SPEAKER_05]: So if private homeowners that take down a preferably protected tree are unable

448
00:35:44,462 --> 00:35:55,309
[SPEAKER_05]: to replace it on property, they'll pay into a tree fund to the city and the city will have a revolving account and a funding mechanism to actually purchase shade trees to be used in public lands and as part of the back street, back of the sidewalk program.

449
00:35:55,689 --> 00:35:57,330
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, it's right on the ball.

450
00:35:57,390 --> 00:36:03,894
[SPEAKER_05]: I think these are some of the issues that we need to vet out, but I think we're really all on the same page in terms of some of the important aspects that we need to put in there.

451
00:36:03,914 --> 00:36:05,415
[SPEAKER_05]: So I thank Councilor Marks for his kind words.

452
00:36:05,775 --> 00:36:09,678
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was the right course withdrawing and bringing forward language from last week's meeting.

453
00:36:09,698 --> 00:36:13,440
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm glad that we had the opportunity to debate that and discuss it and bring this measure forward.

454
00:36:14,037 --> 00:36:14,897
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

455
00:36:15,638 --> 00:36:19,879
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, we have name and address for the record, please.

456
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:21,400
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

457
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,360
[SPEAKER_07]: Curtis Tootin, 38 Early Ave.

458
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,261
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm here tonight representing Medford's Energy and Environment Committee.

459
00:36:26,842 --> 00:36:30,303
[SPEAKER_07]: So first, thank you, councilors, for making trees a priority.

460
00:36:30,763 --> 00:36:35,425
[SPEAKER_07]: Medford's tree canopy has been in decline, so protecting significant community trees is more important than ever.

461
00:36:35,945 --> 00:36:38,406
[SPEAKER_07]: Knowing how critical trees are to public health and ecology,

462
00:36:38,943 --> 00:36:45,728
[SPEAKER_07]: A subcommittee of the Medford Energy and Environment Committee has worked on a report about local tree protection and other aspects of the proposed resolution.

463
00:36:46,188 --> 00:36:51,972
[SPEAKER_07]: It will be completed soon, and the group of volunteers who have spent months working on the draft looks forward to seeing this through.

464
00:36:52,493 --> 00:36:57,616
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, we need to grow our city's tree canopy and not just protect and replace what we have left.

465
00:36:58,437 --> 00:37:02,940
[SPEAKER_07]: Tonight's proposed version of a tree ordinance should be improved on and passed at a later date.

466
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,903
[SPEAKER_07]: So we look forward, overall, to being part of the process when that report is available soon.

467
00:37:07,405 --> 00:37:08,425
[SPEAKER_07]: So again, thank you tonight.

468
00:37:08,546 --> 00:37:10,326
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

469
00:37:11,247 --> 00:37:23,592
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion of Consul Knight, seconded by Consul Scarpelli, to move this paper to the subcommittee on zoning, which is chaired by Consul Scarpelli and members Consul Knight and Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

470
00:37:26,414 --> 00:37:29,295
[SPEAKER_03]: With notice to legal counsel in the Forestry Department.

471
00:37:29,395 --> 00:37:30,175
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

472
00:37:30,195 --> 00:37:30,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

473
00:37:30,816 --> 00:37:31,656
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

474
00:37:31,896 --> 00:37:32,276
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

475
00:37:32,316 --> 00:37:35,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes and the paper is moved to the zoning subcommittee.

476
00:37:36,404 --> 00:37:38,665
Motion to take papers in the hands of the clerk.

477
00:37:38,685 --> 00:37:39,225
[SPEAKER_03]: Second.

478
00:37:39,265 --> 00:37:43,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion by Councilor Knight to take papers in the hands of the clerk, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo.

479
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:52,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Offered by Councilor Marks.

480
00:37:55,051 --> 00:37:58,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Be it resolved that the library capital campaign be discussed.

481
00:37:58,613 --> 00:38:01,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Marks.

482
00:38:03,795 --> 00:38:05,256
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll take that title, Councilor Marks.

483
00:38:05,316 --> 00:38:05,816
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll take that.

484
00:38:06,661 --> 00:38:07,482
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll take any title.

485
00:38:10,404 --> 00:38:11,425
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

486
00:38:13,747 --> 00:38:21,833
[SPEAKER_09]: It was about two months ago we had a person from the Library Foundation Committee appear before this council.

487
00:38:22,614 --> 00:38:25,817
[SPEAKER_09]: It was at the request of I think it was Councilor Lungo-Koehn at the time.

488
00:38:26,737 --> 00:38:35,705
[SPEAKER_09]: And the advisor that was hired by the Library Foundation with the mission of raising private funds

489
00:38:36,418 --> 00:38:41,641
[SPEAKER_09]: to help with the capital campaign towards a $34 million public library.

490
00:38:42,441 --> 00:38:53,506
[SPEAKER_09]: As we all remember, the city of Medford was awarded a $12.3 million grant from the Mass Board of Library Commissioners to construct this $34 million library.

491
00:38:54,467 --> 00:38:59,129
[SPEAKER_09]: And the advisor that appeared before the podium stated, based on their

492
00:39:00,143 --> 00:39:14,308
[SPEAKER_09]: recent outreach and discussion among the Library Foundation group and their different outreach, they anticipate to raise about $3.5 million.

493
00:39:16,989 --> 00:39:27,672
[SPEAKER_09]: The reason why I bring this up, Mr. President, and I mentioned it two months ago that we have a Committee of the Whole meeting, this is a very vital financial economic issue in this community.

494
00:39:28,373 --> 00:39:50,390
[SPEAKER_09]: And the reason why I bring it up is at the time when we were building a new library, or plans to build a new library, it was mentioned that a $34 million library, based on $12.3 million grant, would leave us paying over $18 million for a balance.

495
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:56,975
[SPEAKER_09]: And at the time, it was Mayor Burke that mentioned that she was going to raise privately

496
00:39:57,752 --> 00:39:58,933
[SPEAKER_09]: the amount of the grant.

497
00:39:59,953 --> 00:40:04,235
[SPEAKER_09]: So she was going to go out and raise $12.3 million privately, the amount of the grant.

498
00:40:04,756 --> 00:40:06,056
[SPEAKER_09]: And this was stated.

499
00:40:06,276 --> 00:40:08,277
[SPEAKER_09]: This isn't just off the top of my head.

500
00:40:08,658 --> 00:40:20,944
[SPEAKER_09]: It was stated on two occasions publicly, one during November 2017, that Mayor Burke said she was hopeful donations would be able to match the funds from the state.

501
00:40:22,137 --> 00:40:23,718
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is her quote, Mr. President.

502
00:40:24,258 --> 00:40:40,745
[SPEAKER_09]: We're very optimistic from those that have already been interviewed and people that we have reached out to that we'll be able to parlay the state grant, double it with foundation money, and then be left for the city to put up a piece of about $5 million, which is our goal.

503
00:40:42,085 --> 00:40:50,749
[SPEAKER_09]: We had the foundation advisor appear before us stating $3.5 million was probably an aggressive figure.

504
00:40:51,948 --> 00:40:54,209
[SPEAKER_09]: But that was what they were looking to raise.

505
00:40:54,749 --> 00:41:05,433
[SPEAKER_09]: And I asked Barbara Kerr, the library director, when she was at the podium, I stated to her unequivocally, where is the $12.3 million that you're going to raise privately?

506
00:41:06,074 --> 00:41:13,456
[SPEAKER_09]: And Barbara Kerr, who has been involved with this library planning from day one, said, oh, I never heard of that figure before.

507
00:41:14,277 --> 00:41:15,477
[SPEAKER_09]: Where did that figure come from?

508
00:41:15,857 --> 00:41:19,999
[SPEAKER_09]: And I said, well, it came from the mayor of this city that it was going to be raised privately.

509
00:41:20,662 --> 00:41:40,288
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's why I keep on raising the issue, Mr. President, because as time goes on now, and we have yet to hear back from the Library Foundation, and I'm sure they're doing yeoman's work, reaching out to people, trying to gather money, but as time goes on, there's going to be a rather large commitment outstanding for the taxpayers of this community.

510
00:41:41,391 --> 00:41:45,693
[SPEAKER_09]: And I, as one member of the council, can't turn back to taxpayers and say, you know what?

511
00:41:45,873 --> 00:41:51,796
[SPEAKER_09]: They may have made a commitment, but the $12.3 million they may have said they were going to get, they only got $3 million.

512
00:41:52,457 --> 00:41:53,177
[SPEAKER_09]: So guess what?

513
00:41:53,838 --> 00:41:55,038
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to pay the difference.

514
00:41:57,199 --> 00:42:00,381
[SPEAKER_09]: That may have been a game changer, Mr. President, at the time.

515
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:10,253
[SPEAKER_09]: So when you look at the figures, $12.3 million grant, the foundation money that they're saying, just say $3.5, it may be more, it may be less, who knows?

516
00:42:10,773 --> 00:42:12,014
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe they'll raise the whole amount.

517
00:42:12,354 --> 00:42:17,556
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, but I don't get a warm, fuzzy feeling to date regarding the private funds.

518
00:42:18,056 --> 00:42:19,877
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's $15.8 million.

519
00:42:21,237 --> 00:42:24,458
[SPEAKER_09]: You take that from the $34 million, it leaves you a balance of $18.2 million.

520
00:42:30,555 --> 00:42:32,236
[SPEAKER_09]: We have to start discussing this.

521
00:42:32,677 --> 00:42:41,784
[SPEAKER_09]: We should be having, if not weekly, monthly meetings with the library, with the administration, saying, how are we going to pay for this?

522
00:42:42,185 --> 00:42:44,807
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't want to hear, well, year one, we're all set for year one.

523
00:42:45,287 --> 00:42:45,948
[SPEAKER_09]: There's year two.

524
00:42:46,168 --> 00:42:48,330
[SPEAKER_09]: There's year three, four, five, six.

525
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:55,556
[SPEAKER_09]: There's other projects in line, like the fire department, Mr. President, like the high school, like the police station.

526
00:42:59,547 --> 00:43:12,455
[SPEAKER_09]: The fire station, the plans that were made with the fire station were made based on the fact that private funds were going to be garnered to support this project.

527
00:43:13,076 --> 00:43:16,818
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, if that doesn't come through, does that push the fire station from year 2024 to 2029, 2030?

528
00:43:17,138 --> 00:43:17,559
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

529
00:43:17,639 --> 00:43:19,100
[SPEAKER_09]: And no one's talking about it.

530
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:38,143
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm going to continually bring it up, Mr. President, because it disturbs me when the director of the library that's been involved from day one never recalls a commitment made by the administration of $12.3 million being raised privately.

531
00:43:38,904 --> 00:43:43,546
[SPEAKER_09]: How do you overlook that as the library director involved from day one?

532
00:43:43,926 --> 00:43:46,788
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not a small little fact that you can overlook.

533
00:43:47,468 --> 00:43:49,209
[SPEAKER_09]: That's huge how you're going to pay for this.

534
00:43:50,069 --> 00:43:51,590
[SPEAKER_09]: So again, Mr. President, respectfully,

535
00:43:51,933 --> 00:43:59,894
[SPEAKER_09]: I asked that we have a meeting with the library foundation group that's set up and the library commissioners, I think they should be part of this also.

536
00:44:01,315 --> 00:44:09,416
[SPEAKER_09]: I've spoken to library commissioners regarding this and they're eager to find out what's going on as well, to be quite honest with you.

537
00:44:10,596 --> 00:44:20,018
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have yet to get an answer from this administration other than the fact, in my opinion, that the mayor is hiding from her original commitment.

538
00:44:20,853 --> 00:44:33,160
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, if the mayor thinks she was too aggressive at the time, happened to be during a city debate for office, and maybe she was being a little overly aggressive to Ghana support.

539
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:40,303
[SPEAKER_09]: But now if that's the case, Mr. President, we still have to make ends meet with this project.

540
00:44:41,204 --> 00:44:47,207
[SPEAKER_09]: And according to my figures, there's an $18.2 million balance in this project.

541
00:44:50,145 --> 00:44:51,346
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would ask that we sit up.

542
00:44:51,406 --> 00:44:53,306
[SPEAKER_09]: I know we have a lot of Committee of the Wholes, Mr. President.

543
00:44:53,346 --> 00:44:57,668
[SPEAKER_09]: We joked about it tonight while we were in a Committee of the Whole meeting with the administration.

544
00:44:58,389 --> 00:45:00,910
[SPEAKER_09]: But we really need to sit down as a council.

545
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,981
[SPEAKER_09]: because it was the council that took this vote.

546
00:45:03,541 --> 00:45:10,703
[SPEAKER_09]: This was a very difficult vote regarding public safety, regarding a new library, which I don't think anyone feels that we didn't need at the time.

547
00:45:11,584 --> 00:45:13,264
[SPEAKER_09]: But we were sold a bill of goods.

548
00:45:13,925 --> 00:45:14,965
[SPEAKER_09]: This is what's going to happen.

549
00:45:14,985 --> 00:45:16,105
[SPEAKER_09]: This is how we're going to afford it.

550
00:45:16,526 --> 00:45:22,268
[SPEAKER_09]: And now if this is not how it's going to happen, and this is not how we're going to afford it, we should know how it's going to work.

551
00:45:24,148 --> 00:45:25,009
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

552
00:45:26,009 --> 00:45:27,049
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

553
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:28,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Caraviellola.

554
00:45:29,548 --> 00:45:31,650
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

555
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:39,835
[SPEAKER_06]: Being a member of the Library Foundation, I could shine a little bit of light on what's happening in the last couple of meetings.

556
00:45:39,875 --> 00:45:43,458
[SPEAKER_06]: That 3.5 number that Holly Sargent spoke about

557
00:45:44,583 --> 00:45:46,364
[SPEAKER_06]: The last time she did it was a few months ago.

558
00:45:47,085 --> 00:45:49,526
[SPEAKER_06]: That's changed a little bit.

559
00:45:50,567 --> 00:46:03,555
[SPEAKER_06]: She's had some discussions with some other people that were involved with fundraising and different projects, and I think the expectation of the money raised is going to be different.

560
00:46:03,595 --> 00:46:09,518
[SPEAKER_06]: I think she'll tell you that when you want to have it for her next report.

561
00:46:09,538 --> 00:46:12,080
[SPEAKER_06]: They've met with the people from the Museum of Science.

562
00:46:12,917 --> 00:46:24,044
[SPEAKER_06]: who have been involved with the Bloomberg Foundation, and they've asked us, they've told us that the recommendation was to increase your expectations.

563
00:46:25,025 --> 00:46:27,347
[SPEAKER_06]: That number is not a number you should be looking at.

564
00:46:27,707 --> 00:46:32,450
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're looking at a much higher number, then you should be asking for a lot more than what we're asking for.

565
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:40,035
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think with that, there's been a little bit of change in the foundation, and you may see some different strategies coming out.

566
00:46:40,315 --> 00:46:40,856
[SPEAKER_06]: We've also,

567
00:46:43,438 --> 00:46:48,339
[SPEAKER_06]: fine-tuned the list of local donors from the business community.

568
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:52,280
[SPEAKER_06]: The list that was generated before might have been a little generic.

569
00:46:52,700 --> 00:47:03,302
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's been fine-tuned down to people, you know, real sort of more legitimate sources, you know, taking people off that just came off a general list.

570
00:47:03,402 --> 00:47:11,884
[SPEAKER_06]: And certain members of the foundation are contacting, you know, people to start bringing, to start, you know, developing this.

571
00:47:12,595 --> 00:47:25,140
[SPEAKER_06]: And probably, maybe in May, if everything goes as expected, they may be able to do their first presentation to some people.

572
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:31,402
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, I know the mayor has requested a 3D slide presentation to have.

573
00:47:31,902 --> 00:47:38,964
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I say, a lot of these are one-time acts, so if you're first time out of the box, it's not a good one.

574
00:47:38,984 --> 00:47:40,205
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not gonna be able to go back.

575
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:54,876
[SPEAKER_06]: The foundation is doing a lot of work behind the scenes that people don't know about to hopefully get ready for a May ask of some local people to start on the giving program.

576
00:47:57,259 --> 00:47:58,221
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

577
00:47:58,770 --> 00:48:07,877
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you'd like, we can invite Holly to come back at one of the next few meetings, whatever, and say, just give me a little bit of notice, because she lives up in Maine.

578
00:48:08,618 --> 00:48:12,301
[SPEAKER_06]: And she has to go, so she can make the appropriate plans.

579
00:48:13,942 --> 00:48:15,143
[SPEAKER_03]: You can have her at that committee in the hall.

580
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:16,084
[SPEAKER_03]: We can invite her to that.

581
00:48:16,124 --> 00:48:16,404
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

582
00:48:17,125 --> 00:48:18,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Councilor Marks.

583
00:48:19,987 --> 00:48:20,827
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

584
00:48:20,848 --> 00:48:22,929
[SPEAKER_09]: And I want to thank Councilor Caraviello.

585
00:48:24,270 --> 00:48:27,733
[SPEAKER_09]: If people aren't aware, Councilor Caraviello was one of the first people to start

586
00:48:28,430 --> 00:48:32,211
[SPEAKER_09]: speaking about the poor condition of our public library where our students go.

587
00:48:32,751 --> 00:48:37,612
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think he was one that first raised many of the concerns with the leaks and so forth.

588
00:48:37,672 --> 00:48:39,793
[SPEAKER_09]: So I want to thank him for his efforts on this.

589
00:48:41,253 --> 00:48:46,194
[SPEAKER_09]: I just, I don't want people to think for a second that I don't want to see funds raised.

590
00:48:46,674 --> 00:48:48,594
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm hoping that we raise the full amount.

591
00:48:49,295 --> 00:48:51,475
[SPEAKER_09]: I just think we should have a contingency plan.

592
00:48:52,555 --> 00:48:55,636
[SPEAKER_09]: And if that doesn't work out, how are we going to pay for this?

593
00:48:56,579 --> 00:49:04,962
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's unfortunate when the mayor can sit back and say, well, if that doesn't work out, we have 60,000 people out here that are going to pay for it.

594
00:49:06,023 --> 00:49:08,724
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not the way we should operate government, Mr. President.

595
00:49:09,484 --> 00:49:26,010
[SPEAKER_09]: And there should be, if there's none established now, like they're changing the rules on how they're going to raise money and so forth and different ways of raising money, then we should have a contingency plan on how are we going to afford this if the expectations

596
00:49:26,466 --> 00:49:35,312
[SPEAKER_09]: of what the mayor stated, the 12.3 matching private money doesn't come through, how are we going to gather that money to pay for this library?

597
00:49:35,893 --> 00:49:39,776
[SPEAKER_09]: And if we can't afford it, what are we going to do, Mr. President, moving forward?

598
00:49:41,037 --> 00:49:41,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

599
00:49:41,477 --> 00:49:42,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

600
00:49:42,498 --> 00:49:44,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

601
00:49:44,159 --> 00:49:45,560
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, President Falco.

602
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:47,861
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to thank Councilor Marks for bringing this up.

603
00:49:47,902 --> 00:49:52,285
[SPEAKER_08]: I asked for an update on this a couple months ago due to my concern as well.

604
00:49:53,343 --> 00:50:09,569
[SPEAKER_08]: with the two commitments to raise 12 plus million dollars by the administration and not seeing that happening yet, although I know it's in the works, I am concerned because of the other projects that we also want to get done.

605
00:50:10,149 --> 00:50:16,231
[SPEAKER_08]: The fire station, the fire station improvements, we have the police station bond that we are going to have to start paying back.

606
00:50:17,311 --> 00:50:19,312
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of things that this city needs and

607
00:50:21,486 --> 00:50:23,107
[SPEAKER_08]: I also want to make sure we're on track.

608
00:50:23,127 --> 00:50:38,555
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to make sure that the library moves forward in a timely manner and that it's funded accordingly, like we were promised November 2017 and when the mayor was before us at the council meeting when we agreed to move forward with the library.

609
00:50:39,416 --> 00:50:43,398
[SPEAKER_08]: If I could, Councilor Caraviello, I want to thank you too for all your work on this.

610
00:50:43,947 --> 00:50:54,010
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you mentioned a first presentation in May, but then you also mentioned a new list where we started asking people for money.

611
00:50:54,070 --> 00:50:56,151
[SPEAKER_08]: Has anybody on that list been contacted?

612
00:50:57,591 --> 00:50:58,871
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody's been contacted yet.

613
00:50:58,891 --> 00:51:02,652
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody's been contacted yet.

614
00:51:02,812 --> 00:51:08,774
[SPEAKER_06]: What we've done is they have a generic list of a lot of people in the community.

615
00:51:08,794 --> 00:51:11,635
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot of the people that were on that list

616
00:51:12,617 --> 00:51:16,623
[SPEAKER_06]: were just – they weren't good people to ask.

617
00:51:17,464 --> 00:51:23,812
[SPEAKER_06]: The list has been really – not that they weren't good people to ask, but they shouldn't have been on that list.

618
00:51:24,233 --> 00:51:28,138
[SPEAKER_06]: So the list has been really torn down to some

619
00:51:29,535 --> 00:51:35,397
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, businesses that are larger in size that can afford to make the larger donation.

620
00:51:35,417 --> 00:51:46,961
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and, you know, Barry Sloan is, you know, he's making a lot of the calls to those – to the bigger people that, you know, because, you know, he's got that ability that, you know, we don't have.

621
00:51:47,461 --> 00:51:49,121
[SPEAKER_06]: And other people who – new people on the list.

622
00:51:49,141 --> 00:51:57,084
[SPEAKER_06]: So the goal is to hopefully have something – hopefully in May, later in May, before the summer,

623
00:51:58,068 --> 00:52:00,689
[SPEAKER_06]: to get a feeling onto where we are with this.

624
00:52:01,270 --> 00:52:14,516
[SPEAKER_06]: But I said, when you have Holly come back, I think she'll explain to you what the reasoning was, why the expectation for RASC has gone up from that original number that we had.

625
00:52:14,736 --> 00:52:18,898
[SPEAKER_08]: And we had the original number of 3.5 million that Holly gave us a few months ago.

626
00:52:18,918 --> 00:52:22,620
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a new number that is out there?

627
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:27,022
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have a new number, but there's a different thinking

628
00:52:28,412 --> 00:52:30,053
[SPEAKER_06]: on the amount we should be asking for.

629
00:52:30,573 --> 00:52:35,776
[SPEAKER_06]: Rather than asking for 3.5, we should be asking for a much higher number.

630
00:52:36,257 --> 00:52:43,141
[SPEAKER_08]: And since that meeting, has the commission now understood that the administration's commitment is the 12.3 million?

631
00:52:43,941 --> 00:52:45,102
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we hoping to?

632
00:52:45,122 --> 00:52:51,546
[SPEAKER_06]: The administration isn't really involved in this, other than that that hasn't been discussed.

633
00:52:51,646 --> 00:52:57,509
[SPEAKER_06]: The mayor's, whatever comment the mayor has said or didn't say, that's not part of the foundation.

634
00:52:58,897 --> 00:53:04,279
[SPEAKER_08]: Will the library commission be bringing in the administration to hopefully abide by that commitment?

635
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:07,939
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not the foundation's job to do that.

636
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:10,480
[SPEAKER_06]: They're here to raise as much money as possible.

637
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:13,421
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a private organization.

638
00:53:14,241 --> 00:53:15,381
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't answer to the city.

639
00:53:16,622 --> 00:53:22,143
[SPEAKER_06]: Its sole function is to raise as much money as possible for the Medford Public Library.

640
00:53:23,242 --> 00:53:27,723
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, we don't fall under the auspices of the mayor or anybody else.

641
00:53:28,764 --> 00:53:36,166
[SPEAKER_06]: Anne-Marie Irwin is on the commission for a little bit of guidance.

642
00:53:36,286 --> 00:53:40,047
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like a lot of these questions probably, which are great questions.

643
00:53:40,087 --> 00:53:44,128
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's a private organization, and their goal is to raise as much money as possible.

644
00:53:44,388 --> 00:53:46,829
[SPEAKER_03]: What information, Councilor Marks?

645
00:53:48,449 --> 00:53:50,790
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate you being so candid with us,

646
00:53:51,428 --> 00:53:56,850
[SPEAKER_09]: If it's a private organization, why is our treasurer collector, Anne Marie Irwin, sitting on the committee?

647
00:53:57,410 --> 00:53:58,491
[SPEAKER_06]: She's part of the committee also.

648
00:53:58,531 --> 00:53:59,731
[SPEAKER_06]: She's been asked to be part of the committee.

649
00:53:59,751 --> 00:53:59,891
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

650
00:53:59,951 --> 00:54:03,192
[SPEAKER_09]: So someone from the administration, a city employee.

651
00:54:03,672 --> 00:54:05,193
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a city employee, so I. Right.

652
00:54:06,213 --> 00:54:09,895
[SPEAKER_09]: Is sitting on this committee, but the mayor has nothing to do with this.

653
00:54:10,315 --> 00:54:10,675
[SPEAKER_06]: Not really.

654
00:54:10,695 --> 00:54:12,876
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if she wants to come, she can come.

655
00:54:12,896 --> 00:54:13,896
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, this is.

656
00:54:14,356 --> 00:54:14,556
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

657
00:54:14,936 --> 00:54:16,817
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't answer to the mayor.

658
00:54:18,358 --> 00:54:18,978
[SPEAKER_06]: Anne Irwin does.

659
00:54:19,761 --> 00:54:21,022
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what Ian Irwin does.

660
00:54:21,282 --> 00:54:24,965
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, the goal of the foundation is to raise as much money as possible.

661
00:54:25,145 --> 00:54:25,766
[SPEAKER_09]: And I hope you do.

662
00:54:26,286 --> 00:54:32,291
[SPEAKER_06]: And I say that the thought process has changed from the last time Hawley was here.

663
00:54:32,331 --> 00:54:33,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

664
00:54:34,072 --> 00:54:36,134
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Lungo-Koehn has the floor.

665
00:54:36,814 --> 00:54:43,640
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate the comments, and I understand that the commission is a separate body that doesn't, you know,

666
00:54:45,259 --> 00:54:57,321
[SPEAKER_08]: But what I'm hearing is that the administration and the commission are not working together, not communicating, not... I'm not hearing that.

667
00:54:57,341 --> 00:55:06,043
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm hearing that... My hope... It's sounding like there's no communication to me.

668
00:55:06,323 --> 00:55:11,124
[SPEAKER_08]: But if there is communication, that's what I'm hoping for, that this commitment by the administration to raise $12.3 million

669
00:55:12,923 --> 00:55:26,928
[SPEAKER_08]: is communicated to the foundation, and obviously the administration is helping the foundation raise this money, whether it be everything on top of the 3.5 or that new number, or they're raising the 12.3 and the commission's raising the 3.5 or that new number.

670
00:55:28,528 --> 00:55:41,913
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to make sure those two groups of people are working together, and obviously the council is apprised of what's going on so that we don't get a bond request, like Councilman Marks said, for $20 million in pushing back the FIFA headquarters.

671
00:55:43,585 --> 00:55:45,086
[SPEAKER_08]: back to 2030.

672
00:55:45,226 --> 00:55:47,207
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't want to see that happen.

673
00:55:47,247 --> 00:55:49,649
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think it is important that we have a meeting on it.

674
00:55:49,669 --> 00:55:59,734
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's important that we, maybe every few months, we have, when this representative is here from Maine, that she come to a council meeting.

675
00:55:59,915 --> 00:56:01,816
[SPEAKER_08]: Every three, four months, come to a council meeting.

676
00:56:01,916 --> 00:56:12,562
[SPEAKER_08]: Even more than that, if possible, when the ball starts rolling, to give us quarterly updates on where we're at, where we're going, how we foresee things.

677
00:56:13,110 --> 00:56:18,817
[SPEAKER_08]: I understand maybe nobody was solicited yet, but I have talked to a business or two that has been solicited.

678
00:56:18,837 --> 00:56:22,541
[SPEAKER_08]: A business owner contacted me.

679
00:56:22,661 --> 00:56:23,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

680
00:56:24,183 --> 00:56:24,363
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

681
00:56:24,423 --> 00:56:25,084
[SPEAKER_08]: Point of information.

682
00:56:25,965 --> 00:56:27,326
[SPEAKER_03]: Point of information, Councilor Caraviello.

683
00:56:27,346 --> 00:56:31,471
[SPEAKER_06]: They've been solicited by the Library Foundation, the Alliance here, because no one has been solicited.

684
00:56:33,378 --> 00:56:35,179
[SPEAKER_06]: There's been no solicitation going out there.

685
00:56:35,459 --> 00:56:38,459
[SPEAKER_08]: A reputable business told me they were solicited.

686
00:56:38,499 --> 00:56:39,600
[SPEAKER_06]: Whether or not that's true, I don't know.

687
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:40,860
[SPEAKER_08]: They didn't solicit my business.

688
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,821
[SPEAKER_06]: Listen, I'll give you one information.

689
00:56:46,301 --> 00:56:50,782
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a company that was hired in the beginning that went out there to get a feel in the community.

690
00:56:51,022 --> 00:56:52,443
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't ask for any money.

691
00:56:52,963 --> 00:56:54,103
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I was interviewed for that.

692
00:56:54,243 --> 00:56:58,104
[SPEAKER_06]: They were interviewing people to see what the response in the community was.

693
00:56:58,504 --> 00:57:02,345
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody from the Library Foundation has asked anybody for a penny yet.

694
00:57:02,753 --> 00:57:06,516
[SPEAKER_06]: So if anybody says that the Library Foundation has contacted them, they haven't.

695
00:57:09,118 --> 00:57:15,562
[SPEAKER_06]: I can also assure you that the administration is working with the Foundation to make sure that we all work together.

696
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:15,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.

697
00:57:16,043 --> 00:57:16,903
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

698
00:57:17,203 --> 00:57:18,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Council.

699
00:57:19,685 --> 00:57:20,946
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

700
00:57:22,207 --> 00:57:22,707
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight.

701
00:57:23,208 --> 00:57:24,629
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

702
00:57:24,809 --> 00:57:26,090
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd request that we amend the paper.

703
00:57:26,739 --> 00:57:44,928
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm actually amending the paper by filing an amendment right now, requesting that the Medford Public Library, or its fundraising arm, file an application for determinative eligibility for community preservation funds with the Community Preservation Commission under the funding opportunities for recreational or historic preservation.

704
00:57:46,128 --> 00:57:49,810
[SPEAKER_05]: Ultimately, we have a library there with a number of historic artifacts in it that have been locked up in an attic.

705
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:54,432
[SPEAKER_05]: We're looking to get these artifacts out of the attic and be more visible and accessible to the public.

706
00:57:54,916 --> 00:57:59,599
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, I can't think of any better recreational facility in our community than a library, Mr. President.

707
00:57:59,619 --> 00:58:05,083
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that these two avenues might be available for us to pursue additional funding.

708
00:58:05,584 --> 00:58:11,648
[SPEAKER_05]: I know Councilor Marks has expressed some concern in the past about using CPA funds to fund municipal projects.

709
00:58:11,688 --> 00:58:17,052
[SPEAKER_05]: However, based upon a need for a contingency plan, I think that it only makes sense for us to see whether or not the

710
00:58:17,827 --> 00:58:25,510
[SPEAKER_05]: public library would be eligible for these Community Preservation Act funds by filing a determination of eligibility with the CPC.

711
00:58:25,890 --> 00:58:29,511
[SPEAKER_05]: And then if, in fact, we do need to come up with a contingency plan, maybe that can be part of it.

712
00:58:31,291 --> 00:58:32,092
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

713
00:58:33,432 --> 00:58:42,995
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion of Councilor Marks, as amended by Councilor Knight, seconded by Vice President Lungo-Kirk, a roll call vote has been asked for.

714
00:58:44,256 --> 00:58:45,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

715
00:58:47,843 --> 00:58:50,065
[SPEAKER_11]: 7 in favor, 0 against, motion passes.

716
00:58:50,085 --> 00:58:51,206
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Scarpelli.

717
00:58:51,266 --> 00:58:53,488
[SPEAKER_11]: If we can report to committees.

718
00:59:12,119 --> 00:59:12,940
[SPEAKER_03]: If I may, we have one more.

719
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:13,540
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure, go ahead.

720
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:14,200
[SPEAKER_10]: Under suspension.

721
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:14,740
[SPEAKER_10]: I apologize.

722
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:25,524
[SPEAKER_03]: Offered by Councilor Caraviello, be it resolved that the Medford City Council have the mayor or the appropriate department report to the council regarding the safety of gear worn by Medford firefighters.

723
00:59:26,044 --> 00:59:34,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Be it further resolved that a report on who makes our gear and what materials are the gear comprised of.

724
00:59:34,987 --> 00:59:35,868
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Caraviello.

725
00:59:36,428 --> 00:59:37,088
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

726
00:59:37,108 --> 00:59:39,449
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if, I think probably some of our members

727
00:59:40,173 --> 00:59:48,836
[SPEAKER_06]: saw the report on television this evening on Fox 25 in regards to the chemicals that the firemen's gear is made out of.

728
00:59:49,536 --> 00:59:59,299
[SPEAKER_06]: And there was some concern about the fire retardant material in them has been linked to cancer.

729
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:01,100
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it's called

730
01:00:01,770 --> 01:00:02,531
[SPEAKER_06]: PFAS.

731
01:00:03,271 --> 01:00:17,062
[SPEAKER_06]: And like I said, we don't want to alarm anybody in our community, but I'd like to get a report back from the mayor or whoever on who makes our gear and what materials our gear is comprised of.

732
01:00:17,582 --> 01:00:25,548
[SPEAKER_06]: And also there's a bill at the state house currently going through that would reduce toxic chemicals into protective gear for the firefighters.

733
01:00:25,568 --> 01:00:29,451
[SPEAKER_06]: And I request that our state delegation support that bill HD3590.

734
01:00:31,034 --> 01:00:34,155
[SPEAKER_06]: Currently, only Representative Barber has signed on to that bill.

735
01:00:34,195 --> 01:00:38,115
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we could ask Representative Donato and Gobley to support that also.

736
01:00:38,735 --> 01:00:39,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you repeat the bill number again?

737
01:00:41,096 --> 01:00:41,376
[SPEAKER_06]: HD3590.

738
01:00:41,436 --> 01:00:45,476
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

739
01:00:46,077 --> 01:00:50,257
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion of Councilor Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo.

740
01:00:50,417 --> 01:00:51,197
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

741
01:00:51,577 --> 01:00:51,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

742
01:00:51,657 --> 01:00:52,298
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

743
01:00:52,338 --> 01:00:53,118
[SPEAKER_03]: The motion passes.

744
01:00:54,818 --> 01:00:58,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Offered by Councilor Scarpelli, reports of committees 19-007.

745
01:01:01,099 --> 01:01:04,620
[SPEAKER_03]: February 19th, 2019, Transportation Subcommittee Report.

746
01:01:04,921 --> 01:01:05,821
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarpelli.

747
01:01:06,881 --> 01:01:07,862
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

748
01:01:07,942 --> 01:01:13,104
[SPEAKER_10]: I know this is, if I could just indulge everyone without reading through the whole meeting.

749
01:01:13,164 --> 01:01:14,364
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a very important meeting.

750
01:01:16,545 --> 01:01:28,490
[SPEAKER_10]: We met with representatives from DOT to discuss a very dangerous intersection here in Medford, our corridor of South Street and Main Street.

751
01:01:31,106 --> 01:01:43,175
[SPEAKER_10]: the lack of working lights, and the safety concerns for pedestrians, bicyclists, and drivers trying to traverse that area.

752
01:01:44,756 --> 01:01:46,237
[SPEAKER_10]: We had a very productive meeting.

753
01:01:46,277 --> 01:01:48,218
[SPEAKER_10]: I think our state delegates were here.

754
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:53,021
[SPEAKER_10]: Christine Barber and Representative Donato were here.

755
01:01:53,922 --> 01:01:56,844
[SPEAKER_10]: They lent some very, very important feedback.

756
01:01:57,705 --> 01:02:00,747
[SPEAKER_10]: We learned a lot about that intersection.

757
01:02:01,783 --> 01:02:05,326
[SPEAKER_10]: whether it's under the method privy, under the state privy.

758
01:02:05,847 --> 01:02:10,791
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think we are moving forward to a very important meeting in three weeks' time, I believe.

759
01:02:12,353 --> 01:02:20,199
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that Mr. Blake from our traffic department has done a remarkable job in the last week.

760
01:02:20,740 --> 01:02:23,963
[SPEAKER_10]: He's gotten back to me with seven different correspondents back and forth.

761
01:02:24,503 --> 01:02:27,226
[SPEAKER_10]: He feels that there is going to be some

762
01:02:28,743 --> 01:02:40,088
[SPEAKER_10]: short-term solutions to this issue and a long-term vision to what needs to be done, especially with the building of the police department.

763
01:02:40,148 --> 01:02:53,353
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's very important that when the meeting is called that if anybody is interested to attend, we will be having a subcommittee meeting again.

764
01:02:53,913 --> 01:02:55,554
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe we'll be calling that with the clerk.

765
01:02:56,550 --> 01:03:14,842
[SPEAKER_10]: in due time, but this paper notes all of the questions that were brought up by Council Marks and Council Del Russo and reiterated by the members in our gallery that were frightened of what they've seen in that area.

766
01:03:14,902 --> 01:03:19,905
[SPEAKER_10]: So it is something that I've gotten emails and phone calls from residents.

767
01:03:20,746 --> 01:03:22,307
[SPEAKER_10]: One resident challenged me saying,

768
01:03:23,018 --> 01:03:31,262
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks like nothing will ever happen until somebody passes on in that area, and it's a challenge that I take seriously.

769
01:03:31,942 --> 01:03:50,691
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know that my colleagues support me when I say we will work tirelessly to make sure this, especially this corner, this corridor, is put through every safety precaution to make sure everybody that traverses that area is safe.

770
01:03:51,228 --> 01:03:53,472
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that's very important.

771
01:03:53,752 --> 01:03:55,635
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you.

772
01:03:55,916 --> 01:03:57,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

773
01:03:59,081 --> 01:04:03,107
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Knight to accept the committee report.

774
01:04:03,127 --> 01:04:03,788
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

775
01:04:03,808 --> 01:04:03,868
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

776
01:04:03,908 --> 01:04:04,790
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

777
01:04:04,970 --> 01:04:06,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Councilor Dello Russo.

778
01:04:07,031 --> 01:04:12,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Very briefly, Mr. President, I want to thank Councilor Scarpelli for his leadership in this matter.

779
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:31,408
[SPEAKER_04]: Though we were primarily focused on the issues of Main Street and South Street, that intersection, we did dive in a more broader approach to that whole systemic interaction of streets, Mr. President.

780
01:04:31,568 --> 01:04:33,750
[SPEAKER_04]: And I thought it was a very fruitful discussion.

781
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:42,846
[SPEAKER_04]: representatives of DOT, our state delegation were with us, as well as, again, Todd Blake, our traffic engineer.

782
01:04:43,407 --> 01:05:02,201
[SPEAKER_04]: And I must say, the day I walked out of that meeting with optimism, and partly because Councilor Scarpelli has done such great work on bringing people together in this matter and holding people to the fire, and that's important.

783
01:05:02,766 --> 01:05:05,547
[SPEAKER_04]: But we had very thoughtful discussions in that meeting.

784
01:05:06,088 --> 01:05:16,232
[SPEAKER_04]: And I also want to say that I received a very pessimistic email, and I will with delight see it not to come to fruition.

785
01:05:17,713 --> 01:05:19,153
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Dello Russo.

786
01:05:19,614 --> 01:05:20,254
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight.

787
01:05:21,074 --> 01:05:21,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Marks.

788
01:05:24,116 --> 01:05:25,316
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking at the wrong button.

789
01:05:26,377 --> 01:05:27,337
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

790
01:05:28,438 --> 01:05:31,559
[SPEAKER_09]: I, too, want to go on record thanking Councilor Scarpelli,

791
01:05:32,575 --> 01:05:53,780
[SPEAKER_09]: It was under his leadership calling for this meeting, getting the players at the table, having DOT sit around the table, having the district office there, not just the people that are responsible for the day-to-day activities, but the engineers from our district, from DOT were present, and people that can make decisions.

792
01:05:54,281 --> 01:05:55,961
[SPEAKER_09]: So it was very helpful to have them there.

793
01:05:56,781 --> 01:06:00,142
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it was insightful, which was offered by Councilor Scarpelli,

794
01:06:00,664 --> 01:06:04,966
[SPEAKER_09]: The fact that DOT kept on stating to us they have to adhere to

795
01:06:05,486 --> 01:06:19,496
[SPEAKER_09]: state and federal guidelines and regulations regarding signage, regarding traffic lights, and much of which prevents them from doing what we would like to see them do, which is provide some pedestrian safety in that area.

796
01:06:20,297 --> 01:06:32,906
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was under Councilor Scarpelli's motion that within the next, I think it was 30 or 45 days, that we reconvene with some short-term fixes for that area.

797
01:06:33,866 --> 01:06:45,192
[SPEAKER_09]: And I believe they're going to come back with a number of short-term fixes, whether it's a raised crosswalk, whether it's additional signage, whether it's changing that just blinking light to a steady light for the time being.

798
01:06:45,212 --> 01:06:50,335
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to come back with something, Mr. President, in my opinion, that's going to improve that section.

799
01:06:51,317 --> 01:06:56,180
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would just put out a challenge to my colleague that that is one intersection.

800
01:06:56,200 --> 01:07:03,685
[SPEAKER_09]: I have about another 75 on a list that we need to look at, and I'm sure he'll be eager to take them one at a time.

801
01:07:05,306 --> 01:07:06,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

802
01:07:06,187 --> 01:07:06,387
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

803
01:07:07,367 --> 01:07:08,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarpelli.

804
01:07:08,428 --> 01:07:08,728
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

805
01:07:09,469 --> 01:07:14,392
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want to forget, I think that the work of one person in this room that

806
01:07:15,047 --> 01:07:19,051
[SPEAKER_10]: it gets quickly forgotten, is our clerk, Kurt Abese.

807
01:07:19,251 --> 01:07:27,099
[SPEAKER_10]: I think he worked tirelessly with getting back to me and who exactly the people and the parties we needed at that table.

808
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:32,445
[SPEAKER_10]: And when we walked into that room and we had every single division

809
01:07:32,892 --> 01:07:35,472
[SPEAKER_10]: of transportation there to answer our questions.

810
01:07:35,873 --> 01:07:41,533
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot had to do with our city clerk who worked tirelessly making sure that everybody was represented.

811
01:07:41,574 --> 01:07:43,474
[SPEAKER_10]: So credit where credit is due.

812
01:07:43,494 --> 01:07:45,334
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm taking a lot of credit for doing nothing.

813
01:07:45,714 --> 01:07:47,895
[SPEAKER_10]: I think... Yes, it was.

814
01:07:48,015 --> 01:07:51,855
[SPEAKER_13]: So... Can I answer that?

815
01:07:52,535 --> 01:07:55,416
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't make enough money for him to switch.

816
01:07:59,877 --> 01:08:00,617
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll definitely take it.

817
01:08:00,637 --> 01:08:01,637
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if he wants it.

818
01:08:05,263 --> 01:08:06,964
[SPEAKER_12]: The city clerk should be seen, but not heard.

819
01:08:06,984 --> 01:08:08,446
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to make an exception to that tonight.

820
01:08:09,526 --> 01:08:12,249
[SPEAKER_12]: Council, I very much appreciate the compliment, but this was your work.

821
01:08:12,949 --> 01:08:18,914
[SPEAKER_12]: And I made a couple of phone calls based on expertise and experience I had back at DOT and the T's.

822
01:08:18,974 --> 01:08:19,735
[SPEAKER_12]: This was your work.

823
01:08:20,495 --> 01:08:24,418
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, I appreciate the compliment, but that was a team effort.

824
01:08:25,079 --> 01:08:25,399
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

825
01:08:26,280 --> 01:08:26,660
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

826
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:30,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to receive the report successfully.

827
01:08:30,511 --> 01:08:30,891
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

828
01:08:31,191 --> 01:08:36,754
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, I'd also like to say thank you to Councilor Scarpelli for your hard work and everybody on the Transportation Subcommittee.

829
01:08:36,774 --> 01:08:40,276
[SPEAKER_03]: I know this is a very important issue, a very important public safety issue.

830
01:08:40,296 --> 01:08:42,377
[SPEAKER_03]: We receive calls on this all the time.

831
01:08:43,197 --> 01:08:52,882
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you for your hard work on this and your continued work in the future because I know this issue is going to be continuous.

832
01:08:53,262 --> 01:08:54,022
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you.

833
01:08:54,622 --> 01:09:00,145
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Knight that we adopt the Transportation Subcommittee report.

834
01:09:01,196 --> 01:09:01,857
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

835
01:09:02,277 --> 01:09:02,918
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

836
01:09:03,038 --> 01:09:03,759
[SPEAKER_03]: Report adopted.

837
01:09:03,779 --> 01:09:04,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Report is adopted.

838
01:09:06,342 --> 01:09:07,284
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Scarpelli.

839
01:09:07,304 --> 01:09:09,526
[SPEAKER_10]: If you can just indulge me for one topic.

840
01:09:09,566 --> 01:09:12,430
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that along with this, we had a meeting last week.

841
01:09:13,028 --> 01:09:27,057
[SPEAKER_10]: with the T, and they came to us about adding a few bus stops and moving on to additional traffic due to moving bus routes through our neighborhoods.

842
01:09:28,038 --> 01:09:29,138
[SPEAKER_10]: We've called for a meeting.

843
01:09:30,219 --> 01:09:34,662
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe that next week the representatives from the T will be here again.

844
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:44,946
[SPEAKER_10]: A reverse 9-1-1 is going to go out to the residents of the College Ave, George Street, Main Street areas and the crossing streets.

845
01:09:46,087 --> 01:09:56,234
[SPEAKER_10]: The residents that live, I believe, on Albion Street, where they're going to be adding that bus stop, which will be losing three parking spots.

846
01:09:56,953 --> 01:09:59,275
[SPEAKER_10]: and across the street they're going to be notified.

847
01:09:59,315 --> 01:10:03,619
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to make it public for tonight's meeting that just look out for that.

848
01:10:03,659 --> 01:10:08,683
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's important that we have representatives that are here to discuss some concerns.

849
01:10:09,123 --> 01:10:18,931
[SPEAKER_10]: I know I've already gotten some feedback and some very shocked neighbors that didn't realize that all that T traffic, all the traffic now

850
01:10:19,381 --> 01:10:23,322
[SPEAKER_10]: is going to be coming through that congested area anyway.

851
01:10:23,823 --> 01:10:25,523
[SPEAKER_10]: So it was enlightening.

852
01:10:26,364 --> 01:10:32,586
[SPEAKER_10]: They've had some concerns that I'll share next week with the representative, but I just wanted to make everybody aware of that meeting.

853
01:10:33,166 --> 01:10:39,869
[SPEAKER_10]: Next week we'll be here in a regular meeting here at the council, and they'll be looking for us to vote on

854
01:10:41,285 --> 01:10:44,046
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe additional bus stops.

855
01:10:44,386 --> 01:10:47,807
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what we have the control of here at this council.

856
01:10:48,707 --> 01:11:11,012
[SPEAKER_10]: They can do whatever they want with their bus routes, but it'd be important that we express our concerns, especially those neighbors that live in that area that have to exit their driveways from that main street and understand that things are going to be a little bit slower and there's going to be a lot more waiting around because they moved

857
01:11:12,092 --> 01:11:19,696
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe, 11 stops instead of moving it through Somerville, which would have only affected one street.

858
01:11:19,796 --> 01:11:21,117
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's very important.

859
01:11:21,137 --> 01:11:26,719
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want everybody to know that that meeting is going to be here next week if they want to be heard by the T. So thank you.

860
01:11:27,100 --> 01:11:28,620
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

861
01:11:28,841 --> 01:11:29,461
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight.

862
01:11:29,841 --> 01:11:31,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

863
01:11:31,162 --> 01:11:38,625
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's also important to point out that because we're diverting buses through College Avenue that are going to go past Tufts University, but we're not diverting them.

864
01:11:38,706 --> 01:11:39,446
[SPEAKER_05]: The T is diverting them.

865
01:11:39,466 --> 01:11:40,586
[SPEAKER_05]: The administration signed off on it.

866
01:11:41,917 --> 01:11:44,038
[SPEAKER_05]: that they're asking us just for the temporary bus stops.

867
01:11:44,098 --> 01:11:58,926
[SPEAKER_05]: But ultimately, if you look at the area in front of Tufts University on College Avenue, historically, you'll see a large number of buses that are parked there, buses for whatever team Tufts University is playing at Spicer Field, for whatever team Tufts University is playing at the gymnasium.

868
01:11:59,506 --> 01:12:07,331
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that being said, Mr. President, moving forward, I'd like to see if we can put some contingencies upon it, where as long as this is the temporary bus route, the buses are not able to park on College Avenue.

869
01:12:07,371 --> 01:12:09,812
[SPEAKER_05]: They'd have to be required to park inside the parking lot at Spicer Field.

870
01:12:10,427 --> 01:12:13,690
[SPEAKER_05]: in the interest of public safety, in the interest of the environment, idling, so on and so forth.

871
01:12:14,250 --> 01:12:15,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

872
01:12:15,471 --> 01:12:16,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Dello Russo.

873
01:12:16,412 --> 01:12:24,078
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, the issue really isn't a bus route being added to a street temporarily.

874
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:36,249
[SPEAKER_04]: The issue is that a large amount of traffic that travels over Broadway is going to be diverted through city streets to reroute itself.

875
01:12:36,829 --> 01:12:37,910
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the major issue.

876
01:12:38,468 --> 01:12:53,715
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the efforts of DOT in planning for this for nearly a year have been to bring that perimeter further and further out so people are diverted out and stay on the highway rather than come through the neighborhoods.

877
01:12:54,656 --> 01:13:01,379
[SPEAKER_04]: The communication plan was supposed to have been undertaken by now and I think it's beginning.

878
01:13:01,419 --> 01:13:05,981
[SPEAKER_04]: If you notice on the city's website, the announcements are up and DOT

879
01:13:07,822 --> 01:13:32,308
[SPEAKER_04]: explained to us at one of the committee meetings some month or two ago, when we were talking about this, that based on their experience of doing major disruptive projects over the past several years, vis-a-vis bridge work, the bridge work down over in Austin-Brighton, over the Mass Pike, that Commonwealth Ave.

880
01:13:32,408 --> 01:13:34,469
[SPEAKER_04]: bridge, there were a couple others, and also the

881
01:13:35,369 --> 01:13:40,071
[SPEAKER_04]: What did they call it, the quick 14 or whatever it was they did here on 93?

882
01:13:40,191 --> 01:13:40,551
[SPEAKER_04]: Fast 14.

883
01:13:40,831 --> 01:13:41,872
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it the fast 14?

884
01:13:41,932 --> 01:13:42,072
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

885
01:13:42,312 --> 01:13:43,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Fast 14.

886
01:13:44,193 --> 01:13:54,597
[SPEAKER_04]: That they found that doom notifications further out, at a greater distance of time from when the project commences.

887
01:13:55,333 --> 01:14:05,461
[SPEAKER_04]: was less successful, it kept it fresh in people's minds that they did it three weeks before the project started.

888
01:14:06,301 --> 01:14:08,003
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was part of the rationale for that.

889
01:14:08,483 --> 01:14:17,310
[SPEAKER_04]: But as far as I lament, as Councilor Scarpelli did, that they didn't do the footwork to tell people that there'd be a bus dump in front of their houses.

890
01:14:18,451 --> 01:14:18,691
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

891
01:14:20,393 --> 01:14:32,499
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the other day they had Hobbit Street shut down for a day, working on some of the gas mains and traffic and parking was diverted to people's houses with limited notice.

892
01:14:33,059 --> 01:14:41,703
[SPEAKER_04]: There's been an ongoing for seven months now, repair of a road going on to replace the street to all the pipes.

893
01:14:42,143 --> 01:14:45,645
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, they have a trench down the street that's about 10 feet deep right now.

894
01:14:46,225 --> 01:14:49,747
[SPEAKER_04]: So there are disruptions that we all encounter.

895
01:14:51,278 --> 01:14:52,559
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Dello Russo.

896
01:14:54,721 --> 01:14:55,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Records.

897
01:14:55,662 --> 01:15:00,025
[SPEAKER_03]: The records of the meeting of February 19, 2019 were passed to Councilor Marks.

898
01:15:00,446 --> 01:15:02,267
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Marks, how did you find those records?

899
01:15:02,347 --> 01:15:04,910
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, I reviewed the records, find them to be in order, and move approval.

900
01:15:05,430 --> 01:15:08,513
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion of Councilor Marks to approve the records, seconded by Councilor Knight.

901
01:15:09,182 --> 01:15:10,003
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

902
01:15:10,144 --> 01:15:10,945
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

903
01:15:11,626 --> 01:15:12,447
[SPEAKER_03]: The record's a pass.

904
01:15:12,988 --> 01:15:18,036
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion of Consul Dello Russo to adjourn, seconded by Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

905
01:15:18,076 --> 01:15:19,038
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

906
01:15:19,118 --> 01:15:20,020
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

907
01:15:20,540 --> 01:15:21,262
[SPEAKER_03]: Meeting adjourned.
