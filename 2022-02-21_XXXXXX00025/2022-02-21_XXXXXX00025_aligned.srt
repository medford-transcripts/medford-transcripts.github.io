1
00:00:04,917 --> 00:00:05,958
Hey Medford Bites listeners.

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:12,524
Before I get started, I wanted to announce that the Medford Chamber of Commerce is running a promotion to support local businesses.

3
00:00:13,585 --> 00:00:20,471
If you make a purchase at four participating local businesses during the month of February, you could win two tickets to see Jonathan Van Ness.

4
00:00:20,932 --> 00:00:27,638
You might know him from Queer Eye or his podcast, Getting Curious, at the Chevalier Theatre on March 18th, plus $500 in cash.

5
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:36,932
You can pick up a loyalty card at any participating business or in the lobby of the Chamber's office on 1 Shipyard Way in Medford Square.

6
00:00:37,713 --> 00:00:41,599
There's a link in today's show notes with information about participating businesses.

7
00:00:43,035 --> 00:00:49,917
To supplement today's interview, Chelly shared a speech she wrote titled, Racial Reckoning and Restoration.

8
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:53,438
A link to the full speech can be found in the show notes.

9
00:00:54,379 --> 00:01:05,422
Special shout out to Grace Caldara, Medford resident and fellow Roberts Elementary parent for helping to connect me with Chelly and recommending reading about the history of West Medford.

10
00:01:06,003 --> 00:01:07,263
I hope you enjoy the interview.

11
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,527
Okay, thank you so much for meeting with me today.

12
00:01:17,547 --> 00:01:22,502
If you don't mind just introducing yourself by saying your name and pronouns and a bit about yourself.

13
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:25,970
Yeah, so my name is Chelly Keshavan.

14
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:27,511
My pronouns are she, her, hers.

15
00:01:28,451 --> 00:01:33,052
I am a long-term Medford resident and in part a product of the Medford Public Schools.

16
00:01:34,993 --> 00:01:38,213
I run a maternal health equity nonprofit by day.

17
00:01:38,273 --> 00:01:41,254
It's called the Boston Association of Childbirth Education.

18
00:01:41,714 --> 00:01:44,175
And then I wear a couple of hats in the city of Medford itself.

19
00:01:45,175 --> 00:01:53,197
So I'm newly elected chair of the Human Rights Commission and also recently elected vice president of WMCC, West Metro Community Center.

20
00:01:53,777 --> 00:01:57,098
And then lastly, I sit on the board of directors at Medford Health Matters.

21
00:01:58,579 --> 00:02:01,680
And I have two kids, three and raised in Medford.

22
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,201
So I'm around very much so.

23
00:02:05,581 --> 00:02:05,821
Awesome.

24
00:02:06,081 --> 00:02:06,382
Great.

25
00:02:06,662 --> 00:02:07,042
Thank you.

26
00:02:07,542 --> 00:02:11,984
So we'll talk about a different a couple different pieces of what you of what you just mentioned to hopefully.

27
00:02:12,024 --> 00:02:18,826
But the first question that I always ask every guest is what their favorite place to eat is in Medford and what they like to eat there.

28
00:02:19,962 --> 00:02:24,831
Yeah, so I think my answer to that is always the Brazilian steakhouse.

29
00:02:25,452 --> 00:02:28,558
We have been going we sort of clamored our way in there.

30
00:02:30,526 --> 00:02:33,749
17 years ago, 18 years ago when it opened and we've been going ever since.

31
00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:40,976
And it's come to the point where we've gotten to know Luciano and the sort of family there has watched my kids get older.

32
00:02:40,996 --> 00:02:47,402
We are always in there for kind of everything on the menu, but we will take feijoada on any day.

33
00:02:47,422 --> 00:02:53,488
So it's very, it's always been warm and welcoming and we appreciate an opportunity to get back.

34
00:02:54,838 --> 00:03:03,428
Yeah, we don't, my family doesn't eat meat, so we haven't really been in there, but I've seen like the pictures of their smoothies on the outside, so hopefully.

35
00:03:03,448 --> 00:03:06,492
I appreciate the bakery, they do some good fish too.

36
00:03:06,932 --> 00:03:07,894
Oh yeah, we do fish.

37
00:03:08,074 --> 00:03:08,634
Oh nice, cool.

38
00:03:11,037 --> 00:03:11,638
Awesome.

39
00:03:11,698 --> 00:03:19,526
So I was hoping, you know, for this month being Black History Month, I was hoping to talk a little bit about your work at the West Medford Community Center.

40
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:34,581
I've just been curious, I hear like a lot of folks kind of share their pride about being from West Medford, and I've actually been reading some, a book that the West Medford Community Center put out that sort of highlights the history of the West Medford neighborhood and it being sort of like

41
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:38,828
historically a Black community within Medford.

42
00:03:38,848 --> 00:03:43,709
So I was wondering if you could share a little bit about your experience there and sort of your hopes as the VP.

43
00:03:45,109 --> 00:03:49,310
Yeah, so I am looking at sort of two weeks in as VP.

44
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:59,773
And I think that what is important to highlight about West Medford and the West Medford Community Center is that we're talking about

45
00:04:00,993 --> 00:04:21,225
um a historically middle class black middle class neighborhood um so we're not just got so so much so many narratives discussed like a lift the hood type of discussion and a lot of initiatives speak to um programming sorry programming that kind of

46
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:39,684
You know, programming that's supposed to speak to lower income conversations, or speak to folks who are not going to be able to purchase their own properties and that's not the conversation here, or at least it wasn't.

47
00:04:40,104 --> 00:04:44,846
So I think maybe we're in a place where we need to be thinking about what it means to have

48
00:04:48,127 --> 00:04:58,894
to currently own or to have previously owned and what does it mean to be in a space where you could possibly potentially lose properties you've had, and how do we have conversations about how to prevent that happening.

49
00:04:58,914 --> 00:05:02,356
And what does that mean for preserving the culture of a community.

50
00:05:05,028 --> 00:05:10,690
nevermind conversations or like reparations or intergenerational wealth and just displacement.

51
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:25,416
So if people maybe our age can't afford to buy or stay or they can't afford to choose West Medford to raise their own families who then who's who can and what does that mean where our trajectory is going.

52
00:05:28,297 --> 00:05:31,858
So those are all thoughts that have been on my mind in the last two weeks.

53
00:05:33,895 --> 00:05:51,200
So interesting like in the reading that I was doing it was talking about how like though that neighborhood was developed sort of within cooperation with like white developers or white contractors and that that's sort of like that and that was like something that's highlighted is how it was like the cooperation between.

54
00:05:52,053 --> 00:05:56,474
black people and white people in Medford that sort of helped form that neighborhood or that's kind of how it's phrased in the book.

55
00:05:56,834 --> 00:06:12,598
And I think that this issue that you're describing of like, what does it mean, like, some neighborhoods like might be changing or are changing due to like the cost of buying a home in Medford and who's that pushing out who's like what families are no longer able to stay in the city.

56
00:06:13,018 --> 00:06:16,859
And that's that that feels like an issue like across the city in whatever neighborhood.

57
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:17,580
And I hear

58
00:06:20,403 --> 00:06:25,585
like a lot of different conversations that seem to be like kind of dividing people in the city.

59
00:06:25,645 --> 00:06:35,809
And this seems like something that, like, I'm sure disproportionately impacts like certain parts of the city, but also something that I think most residents might be able to relate to.

60
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:42,211
Yeah, I think it also brings up a conversation of the difference between what

61
00:06:44,567 --> 00:06:45,828
So I will back up.

62
00:06:46,048 --> 00:06:48,789
I have a tendency to not tell the whole story.

63
00:06:49,269 --> 00:06:57,812
I think COVID illuminated sort of systemic policy and systemic failure on a grand scale.

64
00:06:58,933 --> 00:07:02,334
And Medford is no stranger to that.

65
00:07:03,435 --> 00:07:03,655
But

66
00:07:05,443 --> 00:07:16,335
I included have spent the last few years talking about diversity and to buy is, and I think the mayor kind of push for the road around like racism of the public health crisis.

67
00:07:16,776 --> 00:07:25,305
They think we also should be spearheading conversation about the differences between sort of initiatives that are

68
00:07:26,476 --> 00:07:31,699
pro-diversity as opposed to pro-Black, and how much space between those conversations is there?

69
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:37,402
And to what extent can we lift both either, is this both and or not?

70
00:07:40,684 --> 00:07:45,286
And also, is the city of Medford going to continue to welcome families in general?

71
00:07:45,306 --> 00:07:53,010
If we're hitting a place sort of market-wise, are we really just speaking to double-income, no-kid options?

72
00:07:55,817 --> 00:07:59,301
And if housing looks a certain way, what does that mean for what the schools look like?

73
00:07:59,501 --> 00:08:07,549
And if you're on the hook for a certain kind of bracket around housing, what do you need from the school systems to want to be here, stay here?

74
00:08:07,609 --> 00:08:09,010
Are you raising toddlers and leaving?

75
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,512
Yeah.

76
00:08:12,413 --> 00:08:12,614
Wow.

77
00:08:12,734 --> 00:08:12,934
Yeah.

78
00:08:13,274 --> 00:08:14,055
It's a whole big picture.

79
00:08:14,075 --> 00:08:20,221
How does your work with the HRC kind of overlap with some of the stuff you're doing at the community center?

80
00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:22,589
I'm so same.

81
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,970
I've been chair for literally a week.

82
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:35,854
My approach with any new role is to begin with needs assessments and listening audits.

83
00:08:36,575 --> 00:08:50,340
I can only bring my own perspective, so I need to present myself as a person who's willing to listen and learn first, and then discuss what thought partnering or thought leading could look like.

84
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:53,992
So that's my fence for now.

85
00:08:54,153 --> 00:09:07,425
And maybe to also onboard HRC has and has had some really strong voices, but they are folks who are in a different place in life than at least I am.

86
00:09:08,246 --> 00:09:12,390
And I think it might be good to diversify along age lines too or generational lines.

87
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:14,707
we haven't done it yet.

88
00:09:14,867 --> 00:09:30,050
And my sense is always saying, people like us parents are going to be, I mean, I don't want to say stuck, but we're going to need something different from Medford than folks who have, who have yet to raise or who have already raised children and have a little more mobility.

89
00:09:33,251 --> 00:09:33,611
Yeah.

90
00:09:34,171 --> 00:09:39,872
And so being new to both of those roles, what kind of drove you to get involved with the community center and with the HRC?

91
00:09:44,388 --> 00:09:55,273
So, I mentioned that my kids are the Cambridge principal, I am large, a largely through myself into getting involved after the statement on Floyd came out from sitting home.

92
00:09:56,534 --> 00:10:02,057
And at that time I had, I was sort of sleeping in Medford I didn't have a one.

93
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:05,587
a social network here, and that was by choice.

94
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:19,559
I was sort of fed up with the level of racism and feeling like we are two miles away from Cambridge, but light years away from the level of conversation that's happening socially in Cambridge, and I just kind of didn't deal with it for 10 years.

95
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:27,866
And then after Floyd, lockdown helped me to have time for that, and I threw myself, and I

96
00:10:29,667 --> 00:10:34,389
decided to become a person who would at least participate instead of complaining.

97
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:44,893
So kind of just one conversation led to another, and it became, I jumped on the commission, and then that became getting to know a lot of people very quickly.

98
00:10:44,913 --> 00:10:51,655
I got involved with council conversations, and then I worked with Wendy, and that became my first health matters.

99
00:10:51,996 --> 00:10:54,637
And then the commission work became like, well, what if you were chair?

100
00:10:56,933 --> 00:11:03,159
So, and as you, Medford's timepiece, so if you know 10 people, you know 101, exponentially.

101
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:04,941
Yeah, awesome.

102
00:11:05,001 --> 00:11:13,969
And so I guess like, you know, you're speaking, you spoke just now about kind of the sense that you had about the community of Medford before the murder of George Floyd, right?

103
00:11:14,029 --> 00:11:20,436
And that that sort of changed your sort of desire to engage maybe with the community and

104
00:11:21,336 --> 00:11:36,931
I wonder like what you have for hopes like so what you hope to see from Medford moving forward or kind of, you know, as we sort of, you know, hopefully begin to address some of these bigger like sort of issues of inclusivity and exclusivity.

105
00:11:39,613 --> 00:11:46,738
I think that gentrification in the way that it has hit Camberville hasn't quite hit Medford to the same extent yet.

106
00:11:46,819 --> 00:11:50,741
So I wonder if we can capitalize on some intentionality before it does.

107
00:11:51,582 --> 00:12:07,014
And if we can be careful about how we're welcoming folks with young kids, folks, families, multi-generational families, because it used to be that Medford was a space where you could raise your kids, also take care of your parents.

108
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:19,330
Yeah, live here I think a lot of people have their needs met in surrounding communities and sort of home, just to be home.

109
00:12:20,712 --> 00:12:26,137
So I wonder what it would look like to have more of a vibrant city to be a little bit more resource rich.

110
00:12:28,112 --> 00:12:29,834
to have greater connections with Tufts.

111
00:12:30,955 --> 00:12:36,540
I really want to see Tufts give back given how much of Metro they occupy and continue to purchase.

112
00:12:38,401 --> 00:12:46,669
I'd like to see us get away from vehicles if we can, although 92 is a hassle right in the center of the city.

113
00:12:46,829 --> 00:12:48,511
Educational equity conversations.

114
00:12:49,832 --> 00:12:50,553
Yeah, I heard

115
00:12:51,832 --> 00:13:10,263
I don't know if I don't know if it's a rumor or if it's like if this is happening, but the new like talks about great the green line extending into Medford again and sort of who that might impact what neighborhoods that might impact and that sort of speaks to that like yeah that sort of that sort of idea around gentrification.

116
00:13:12,874 --> 00:13:18,817
Right now, where it's located only really serves Tufts, and Tufts already has their own shuttle, and they're already only 10 minutes from Davis.

117
00:13:19,518 --> 00:13:23,660
So it doesn't impact Metro Knights until it hits 16 at least.

118
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,621
Yeah.

119
00:13:26,201 --> 00:13:26,381
Yeah.

120
00:13:26,881 --> 00:13:27,222
Yeah.

121
00:13:27,442 --> 00:13:34,085
And I did see on the, I think it was on Facebook, that the West Metro Community Center is planning some events for Black History Month.

122
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:35,726
Do you mind describing some of those?

123
00:13:36,626 --> 00:13:36,926
Yeah.

124
00:13:39,182 --> 00:13:41,244
So a couple of things.

125
00:13:42,105 --> 00:13:46,289
We're wanting to just teach, engage new people.

126
00:13:46,609 --> 00:13:49,732
I think the center needs to like build a new network.

127
00:13:51,174 --> 00:13:54,717
I think just teaching people about who we are, where we've been.

128
00:13:56,512 --> 00:14:02,055
So just sharing straight historical facts I have, I'd love to just share one a day.

129
00:14:02,075 --> 00:14:04,337
I also have a couple of panels in mind.

130
00:14:04,357 --> 00:14:17,404
I think for me, the most exciting panel is to partner with President Morrell and Vice President Bayers and say, what does it look like for Medford to onboard a pro-Black agenda?

131
00:14:18,044 --> 00:14:23,847
And there are some community members who spoke to the Black Lives Matter banner issue two years ago.

132
00:14:25,453 --> 00:14:38,320
And we might start there in that panel, but I'd prefer to see us kind of approach it holistically or intersectionally and say, what can Medford be doing?

133
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:41,161
And frankly, I haven't seen that energy.

134
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:47,384
I personally haven't, maybe others have, but I personally haven't seen it come out of the council historically.

135
00:14:48,044 --> 00:14:49,045
How and when does that change?

136
00:14:49,673 --> 00:14:50,273
Yeah.

137
00:14:50,914 --> 00:15:03,021
We're also going to host a panel that features a couple of Black artists, locally known Black artists, sort of Metro Boston now, because the center historically was well connected with Cambridge, Roxbury, Mattapan, Newton.

138
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:08,063
So it would be, I want to get back there.

139
00:15:08,103 --> 00:15:09,904
I don't see why we can't get back there.

140
00:15:09,944 --> 00:15:15,147
And I see like connecting with folks who represent other communities as one vehicle to do that.

141
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:17,329
So these guys are going to talk about

142
00:15:19,993 --> 00:15:26,957
what it means to be an artist, document, and speak to a narrative that doesn't always feel welcome.

143
00:15:27,417 --> 00:15:29,458
And I think artists in general, I don't know that we're right.

144
00:15:30,098 --> 00:15:34,961
I think of us as being a heavily academic and science-based community.

145
00:15:36,202 --> 00:15:42,605
I'm working on screening the racial reckoning documentary that PBS has been discussing.

146
00:15:42,645 --> 00:15:42,985
And again,

147
00:15:45,034 --> 00:15:51,945
asking them to highlight the reasons why West Meckler was historically middle class and more, as opposed to a different story.

148
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:05,506
There was a conversation with you the people, although it's an again in an effort to just create new networks.

149
00:16:06,407 --> 00:16:07,588
We'll see where that goes.

150
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:17,395
I am a brand new board member I'm not sure how the board would feel about becoming an entity that offers racial justice discussions or trainings.

151
00:16:21,645 --> 00:16:29,888
Yeah, there's, I think there's, we can only move forward, kind of stagnant, so we can only move forward.

152
00:16:30,149 --> 00:16:33,830
But those are the kind of couple of things happening for the last three months right now.

153
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:35,631
Great.

154
00:16:35,671 --> 00:16:48,516
So you said the conversation with President Morrell and Vice President Perez was about, I'm sorry, I'm forgetting the words that you described, was it a black, what was it?

155
00:16:49,897 --> 00:16:50,237
Yeah, so

156
00:16:52,085 --> 00:16:53,105
So it hasn't happened yet.

157
00:16:53,225 --> 00:16:55,286
It's a panel in fruition.

158
00:16:55,766 --> 00:17:02,069
But to say given that the council, you know, council leadership just changed.

159
00:17:03,349 --> 00:17:06,330
Could we I don't want the conversation to get out of hand.

160
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:08,871
It's probably going to be like a 45 minute zoom.

161
00:17:08,931 --> 00:17:13,152
So we'll have we'll host just the two of them for now.

162
00:17:13,893 --> 00:17:20,175
But to take advantage of the moment at hand and use your new leadership to partner and

163
00:17:21,444 --> 00:17:25,626
like, please view the West Metro Community Center as a thought partner in this agenda.

164
00:17:26,426 --> 00:17:41,452
And also to raise the, I think the center has space to become present, sort of in the city landscape and climate, and this could be a reason to do that.

165
00:17:42,392 --> 00:17:44,073
Yeah, no, and I think that,

166
00:17:45,392 --> 00:17:55,640
A couple episodes ago, we talked about the incident at the holiday celebration around the representation of Judaism there and misrepresentation.

167
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:59,703
It seems like that was a lesson that City Hall took from that.

168
00:17:59,923 --> 00:18:05,127
It was like, what are the groups that we can rely on to help us do the right thing in these situations?

169
00:18:05,147 --> 00:18:13,873
And it seems like the West Medford Community Center is a really important resource when thinking about the Black community in Medford.

170
00:18:15,832 --> 00:18:16,693
Yeah, for sure.

171
00:18:17,574 --> 00:18:20,957
I mean, also, as you can probably our own leadership has changed.

172
00:18:20,997 --> 00:18:23,380
We also have a new president, we have a new executive director.

173
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,062
So it's the right moment for us internally as well.

174
00:18:29,385 --> 00:18:32,469
Oh, I wanted to make space to talk about anything else that you hope to talk about.

175
00:18:32,489 --> 00:18:35,892
So with any of your the other work that you're doing, or the other groups that you're part of?

176
00:18:37,374 --> 00:18:51,142
Um, I mean yeah I'm a, I'm a doula and a CLC so I'm always putting in plugs for like when will I maybe it's me, maybe it's my nonprofit but I don't see Medford as a space that hosts perinatal options.

177
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:57,801
I could be right and also my kids are suddenly not babies anymore so I'm not really looking for that.

178
00:18:59,422 --> 00:19:12,846
But I have had conversations where we around the how we could be like other cities have programming that sort of tracks, all the newborns that are, you know, that come to us, and could be doing that.

179
00:19:13,746 --> 00:19:15,907
Could we be doing that with like cultural sensitivity.

180
00:19:19,485 --> 00:19:21,305
Yeah, just what does that look like?

181
00:19:21,425 --> 00:19:24,266
I'm not sure that we have DD options in the city.

182
00:19:29,948 --> 00:19:31,408
We don't have any breastfeeding groups.

183
00:19:31,728 --> 00:19:34,109
We don't have accessible diaper pantry.

184
00:19:34,989 --> 00:19:36,149
There are so many things.

185
00:19:36,749 --> 00:19:40,090
Also, documentation issues.

186
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:40,730
Yeah.

187
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:59,043
sort of some of those like, like sort of the social determinants of health, the ways that that like mothers can be supported to sort of help support the health of their own health, the health of their kids, and then also the health of our community and keeping it like a diverse and equitable place.

188
00:20:00,424 --> 00:20:01,685
Well, yeah, upstream initiative.

189
00:20:02,426 --> 00:20:04,928
Yeah, I think we have, we have.

190
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:09,832
I also would like to learn more about preschool.

191
00:20:12,005 --> 00:20:13,285
I have a lot of homework to do.

192
00:20:13,486 --> 00:20:14,106
Yeah.

193
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:15,166
Yeah.

194
00:20:15,266 --> 00:20:17,767
I think that determines very much fall upstream.

195
00:20:18,107 --> 00:20:19,447
Yeah.

196
00:20:19,567 --> 00:20:29,030
And how do you hope like sort of to include the community or is there anything that like the community or people listening to the podcast could know in terms of how to support your work or support the community center?

197
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:34,011
I would want communities to know that

198
00:20:36,913 --> 00:20:39,394
I'd love to see them show up on council calls.

199
00:20:39,734 --> 00:20:47,098
I think there are sort of a grouping of folks who show up typically, and then there are a whole bunch of people the council doesn't often hear from.

200
00:20:47,118 --> 00:21:00,824
I'd also like people to know that I always want them to think about the candidates that are running, make choices around voting, think about what campaigns matter for their lived experience.

201
00:21:03,925 --> 00:21:12,828
And I think in leadership, we need to make that easier to make it as easy as possible to communicate with the administration.

202
00:21:14,348 --> 00:21:14,628
Great.

203
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:15,889
Yeah.

204
00:21:16,529 --> 00:21:16,829
Awesome.

205
00:21:17,449 --> 00:21:20,730
Anything else you'd like to add or like plug before we wrap up?

206
00:21:23,717 --> 00:21:25,018
And I don't think so.

207
00:21:25,098 --> 00:21:28,260
Although I'm often the type of person who thinks of 10 things after the fact.

208
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,901
So my fault for that.

209
00:21:30,342 --> 00:21:31,042
No, no.

210
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:32,903
Well, I really appreciate you making the time.

211
00:21:34,124 --> 00:21:40,809
And hopefully we can reconnect once you've been in those positions for a little while and see what else is going on.

212
00:21:40,849 --> 00:21:41,029
Yeah.

213
00:21:41,289 --> 00:21:41,629
Awesome.

214
00:21:53,601 --> 00:21:55,622
