[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, hi, Philip.

58
00:02:15,992 --> 00:02:17,633
[SPEAKER_00]: Come join us.

59
00:02:17,973 --> 00:02:24,035
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll make it for you.

60
00:02:24,135 --> 00:02:24,895
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise.

61
00:02:24,915 --> 00:02:25,576
[SPEAKER_00]: Um okay.

62
00:02:25,616 --> 00:02:26,536
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh yeah.

63
00:02:26,816 --> 00:02:28,997
[SPEAKER_00]: Five absentee, twenty credit.

64
00:02:29,157 --> 00:02:30,618
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the meeting is called to order.

65
00:02:31,758 --> 00:02:32,278
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh okay.

66
00:02:32,858 --> 00:02:35,860
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping that we won't need the full two hours tonight.

67
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,300
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh I know everyone probably

68
00:02:40,681 --> 00:02:41,661
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see what we can do.

69
00:02:42,422 --> 00:02:47,225
[SPEAKER_05]: Marissa, if you have any questions, feel free to raise your hand.

70
00:02:47,265 --> 00:02:48,766
[SPEAKER_05]: You can all see your squares.

71
00:02:48,786 --> 00:02:52,088
[SPEAKER_05]: So that might just help us know that you want to get a wordage.

72
00:02:55,831 --> 00:02:59,193
[SPEAKER_05]: The next thing on the agenda is what we call a consent agenda.

73
00:02:59,273 --> 00:03:04,177
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's essentially a place where you put items that have to be officially approved by the committee.

74
00:03:05,261 --> 00:03:09,242
[SPEAKER_05]: but for which like there's probably no conversation really to have.

75
00:03:09,702 --> 00:03:21,086
[SPEAKER_05]: So the three items that are in there that we need to approve tonight are our meeting minutes from our personal meeting, from our relief and onboarding subcommittee meeting, from our communications and community engagement subcommittee meeting.

76
00:03:22,686 --> 00:03:26,167
[SPEAKER_05]: If you take a look at the meeting minutes, you will see that they are very late.

77
00:03:27,247 --> 00:03:33,369
[SPEAKER_05]: That is because those meetings by and large did not have a lot of action in terms of motion

78
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:37,810
[SPEAKER_05]: and votes and things to approve or deny.

79
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:46,277
[SPEAKER_05]: We also, in the electronic version of this, you can click a link to the YouTube channel and see the actual reported meeting there.

80
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:52,182
[SPEAKER_05]: We try to err on the side of slimmer minutes.

81
00:03:52,382 --> 00:04:00,049
[SPEAKER_05]: These are still totally permissible under the OPA law, but the more detailed they are, the more like you have to read and recount and say what's accurate,

82
00:04:00,725 --> 00:04:02,385
[SPEAKER_05]: that I've saved them that quite way.

83
00:04:02,405 --> 00:04:13,108
[SPEAKER_05]: And you just find that that sort of leads to just a lot of work that I can try to avoid if I can.

84
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:17,348
[SPEAKER_05]: So the consent agenda is basically approving the meeting minutes.

85
00:04:18,169 --> 00:04:23,310
[SPEAKER_05]: And the meeting minutes also include several documents that we'll actually talk about in some detail.

86
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,490
[SPEAKER_05]: But the first thing

87
00:04:25,368 --> 00:04:30,393
[SPEAKER_00]: is for somebody to make a motion to approve an incentive agenda.

88
00:04:30,753 --> 00:04:37,480
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we've got motion by Mayor London Kern, seconded by Reese.

89
00:04:38,761 --> 00:04:39,062
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

90
00:04:40,823 --> 00:04:43,626
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

91
00:04:45,408 --> 00:04:49,772
[SPEAKER_05]: If there was something that you were like, I want to talk about this thing separately, you just

92
00:04:50,353 --> 00:04:56,956
[SPEAKER_05]: just let me know, and we will sever that, we'll pull it out, we'll vote everything else through, and then pass the conversation.

93
00:04:56,976 --> 00:04:59,057
[SPEAKER_06]: If that makes sense.

94
00:04:59,777 --> 00:05:15,864
[SPEAKER_05]: And in general, we're gonna try to drop the Robertson's border without boring you all with lots of financial about Robertson's border, so the general thing is if you have a question and you don't know how to do it, just ask, and the people that take questions know what to do.

95
00:05:17,647 --> 00:05:35,397
[SPEAKER_05]: And the other thing that's worth noting about the law is that if there are people, it is a hybrid meeting in terms of participants, we do a roll call.

96
00:05:35,417 --> 00:05:39,859
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to do a roll call so that we can vote this through.

97
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:41,760
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no other part, right?

98
00:05:42,501 --> 00:05:42,701
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

99
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:48,392
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so on the motion to approve the consent agenda, they have a long term.

100
00:05:48,552 --> 00:05:48,852
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

101
00:05:49,572 --> 00:05:49,872
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

102
00:05:50,032 --> 00:05:50,172
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

103
00:05:50,192 --> 00:05:50,432
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

104
00:05:50,472 --> 00:05:50,633
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

105
00:05:50,733 --> 00:05:51,053
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

106
00:05:51,533 --> 00:05:51,773
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

107
00:05:51,873 --> 00:05:52,173
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

108
00:05:52,213 --> 00:05:52,473
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

109
00:05:52,593 --> 00:05:52,753
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

110
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:53,013
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

111
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:18,847
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, 15 in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the minutes are up.

112
00:06:19,648 --> 00:06:20,149
[SPEAKER_05]: For three.

113
00:06:21,643 --> 00:06:44,521
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things that we charge the rules and onboarding team to do is provide a set of operating rules for this committee and give some thought to onboarding both for all of you, as well as for people who may join this committee over time, because that's sort of inevitable when you talk about a seven, six, seven year project.

114
00:06:45,362 --> 00:06:48,244
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you flip through your packet,

115
00:06:49,545 --> 00:06:56,829
[SPEAKER_05]: What I wanted to do is just go through these rules and ask you all like what questions you have.

116
00:06:57,429 --> 00:07:01,251
[SPEAKER_05]: If you think anything's missing, this is a place where we can certainly amend these rules.

117
00:07:01,332 --> 00:07:06,815
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when we're done reviewing the rules, we will take a vote to adopt them.

118
00:07:07,615 --> 00:07:10,977
[SPEAKER_05]: So the rules committee met

119
00:07:12,212 --> 00:07:14,554
[SPEAKER_05]: for about an hour, so they were incredibly efficient.

120
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:20,440
[SPEAKER_05]: We did a fast job of trying to create a set of rules and an onboarding checklist.

121
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,361
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll start with the rules.

122
00:07:23,122 --> 00:07:33,792
[SPEAKER_05]: The first thing that we have in here is essentially that we will simply use SBC as the acronym for this, because if you add all of the Medford Comprehensive

123
00:07:35,834 --> 00:07:41,923
[SPEAKER_05]: high school building committee it's a lot of letters so we will adopt SPC as our sort of common acronym.

124
00:07:43,797 --> 00:08:12,390
[SPEAKER_05]: item number two we had some discussion about so if you watch council meetings or school committee meetings everyone is member so-and-so counselor so-and-so we sort of landed on a slightly different approach we are residents and neighbors and as such we will refer to each other by our first name unless somebody requests otherwise the mayor of medford will be referred to as mayor and the superintendent will be referred to as superintendent but otherwise we're going to be friends and neighbors first and committee members second so

125
00:08:13,273 --> 00:08:14,220
[SPEAKER_05]: That's item number two.

126
00:08:16,152 --> 00:08:19,973
[SPEAKER_05]: Members of the SBC are urged to speak for themselves using I statements.

127
00:08:20,713 --> 00:08:22,413
[SPEAKER_05]: Allow for one speaker at a time.

128
00:08:22,673 --> 00:08:24,413
[SPEAKER_05]: Be present, engaged, and prepared.

129
00:08:25,174 --> 00:08:27,174
[SPEAKER_05]: Engage in honest and open conversation.

130
00:08:27,894 --> 00:08:33,495
[SPEAKER_05]: Assume the best intentions and understand and acknowledge intent and hold themselves and one another accountable.

131
00:08:34,575 --> 00:08:40,096
[SPEAKER_05]: Item number four, public comment will be limited to three minutes per individual and will be limited to those matters on the agenda.

132
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:44,197
[SPEAKER_05]: The chair may limit comment to two minutes based on the number of individuals wishing to speak.

133
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:48,623
[SPEAKER_05]: The chair will announce the timeline before any public comment period at every meeting.

134
00:08:50,205 --> 00:08:54,231
[SPEAKER_05]: The public will also be encouraged to submit their comments in writing by emailing the SBC account.

135
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:57,516
[SPEAKER_05]: Those emails will be auto forwarded to all members when they come in.

136
00:08:59,626 --> 00:09:04,068
[SPEAKER_05]: Item number five, the SBC will operate following Robert's Rules of Order.

137
00:09:04,228 --> 00:09:10,010
[SPEAKER_05]: And what we try to do here is give you like the ones you need to know in order to sort of function in a basic way.

138
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:14,792
[SPEAKER_05]: So voting happens when a motion to do something is made and seconded after debate.

139
00:09:16,192 --> 00:09:20,314
[SPEAKER_05]: Under the open meeting law, voice votes are allowed when everybody is physically present.

140
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:22,955
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's where we say all those in favor, all those opposed.

141
00:09:23,915 --> 00:09:25,216
[SPEAKER_05]: and you just say aye or nay.

142
00:09:26,456 --> 00:09:29,678
[SPEAKER_05]: However, when any voting member is remotely participating, a roll call is required.

143
00:09:30,838 --> 00:09:33,019
[SPEAKER_05]: Any voting member may request a roll call vote.

144
00:09:33,099 --> 00:09:43,904
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we were all here in person and there was something sort of squirrelly going on and you were like, no, I really want to know where everybody stands, you just say roll call and then we will do an official roll call so everyone has to register their vote.

145
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,927
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, any voting member may suggest an amendment to the motion.

146
00:09:48,648 --> 00:09:51,791
[SPEAKER_05]: The chair will guide and support members in following Robert's rules during the meetings.

147
00:09:52,352 --> 00:09:55,535
[SPEAKER_05]: Members may speak twice on any debatable motion for up to three minutes.

148
00:09:56,396 --> 00:10:00,940
[SPEAKER_05]: And once voting begins, no member may speak other than to indicate how they are voting.

149
00:10:03,368 --> 00:10:16,392
[SPEAKER_05]: If a voting member of the committee believes a mistake was made with a motion that passed or failed and that member was in the majority for that motion, they may make a motion to reconsider to do so by speaking to the chair on how to proceed.

150
00:10:16,453 --> 00:10:20,214
[SPEAKER_05]: So in other words, if something happens really fast and

151
00:10:20,994 --> 00:10:28,661
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, it was sort of a split vote, and somebody that was on the winning side says, wait a minute, I don't think we all know what we just did there.

152
00:10:28,782 --> 00:10:37,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, there's a process for us to reconsider, as long as that is raised by somebody who was in the majority vote.

153
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:43,516
[SPEAKER_05]: And if that happens, just say, wait a minute, I have a question, and we'll like work through the mechanics of how to do that.

154
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:53,905
[SPEAKER_05]: And then if items on the agenda will be taken out of order from how they are presented on the agenda, a voting member must make a motion to suspend the rules and take them specifically out of order.

155
00:10:55,286 --> 00:10:59,609
[SPEAKER_05]: Item number six, the chair will create the agenda and place certain items within the consent agenda item.

156
00:11:00,751 --> 00:11:07,258
[SPEAKER_05]: Item number seven, all SBC meetings and or any SBC subcommittee shall operate according to the open meeting law.

157
00:11:07,699 --> 00:11:14,847
[SPEAKER_05]: The SBC shall to the best of its ability ensure its meetings are reported by Medford Public Media and broadcast live to the district YouTube channel.

158
00:11:15,848 --> 00:11:20,153
[SPEAKER_05]: Media requests for comment from the SBC will be directed to the chair of the SBC.

159
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:27,615
[SPEAKER_05]: Number nine, non-voting members will be called during the roll call at the beginning of the meetings, but their presence will not be counted towards a forum.

160
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:30,037
[SPEAKER_05]: I did that sort of while I was calling the roll.

161
00:11:31,138 --> 00:11:41,667
[SPEAKER_05]: Non-voting members will not be called for the adjournment of meetings, as this is just simply a vote to adjourn the meeting, and our non-voting members cannot be counted in that group.

162
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:48,593
[SPEAKER_05]: And then item number 10, new members of the SBC will be on-boarded following the checklist, which will be maintained by the response committee.

163
00:11:50,692 --> 00:11:53,293
[SPEAKER_05]: That's sort of our proposed set of rules.

164
00:11:53,373 --> 00:12:02,356
[SPEAKER_05]: So the subcommittee both created and considered these rules and is bringing them here tonight for discussion.

165
00:12:02,456 --> 00:12:14,860
[SPEAKER_05]: So I will open the floor if anyone has questions, comments, thoughts, anything they want to change, like this is the time for us to do that because we will adopt those changes as we go.

166
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,160
[SPEAKER_06]: Mayor?

167
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,121
[SPEAKER_06]: Quick question, thank you.

168
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:41,118
[SPEAKER_06]: chair did did you discuss giving everybody three minutes and then limited it to one first one time per topic yes um and the limit to one time per topic did not

169
00:12:41,926 --> 00:12:43,187
[SPEAKER_05]: because you may get in here.

170
00:12:44,308 --> 00:12:48,132
[SPEAKER_05]: And that actually completely mirrors how we do public participation at the school.

171
00:12:48,152 --> 00:12:54,898
[SPEAKER_05]: So people are welcome to speak on any item that we're discussing, like members of the public could be weighing in on the rules right now.

172
00:12:56,259 --> 00:13:03,846
[SPEAKER_05]: But yes, we generally do limit to three minute per person and you can't just get back in line and come back up again and talk for three more minutes.

173
00:13:04,486 --> 00:13:10,750
[SPEAKER_05]: And if there's a lot of public participation, we sort of can make those adjustments on the fly under our rules.

174
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:16,894
[SPEAKER_05]: So we would, yeah, so we would add one time to that item.

175
00:13:16,914 --> 00:13:21,817
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I see somebody with a question?

176
00:13:21,837 --> 00:13:22,037
[SPEAKER_05]: Luke?

177
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:42,408
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if that's something just all collectively decided to do without having the department pass a rule for it.

178
00:13:42,428 --> 00:13:43,429
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think we can.

179
00:13:43,449 --> 00:13:46,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, yeah, we can do that for the next meeting.

180
00:13:49,555 --> 00:13:49,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Emily?

181
00:13:50,776 --> 00:13:56,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we following all of the repertorials order and this is just a reminder of the basic ones that are most common?

182
00:13:57,042 --> 00:13:57,263
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

183
00:13:57,283 --> 00:13:57,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

184
00:13:58,284 --> 00:13:58,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

185
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:03,653
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think they're hopefully for our purposes, the ones that will need to be used here.

186
00:14:03,673 --> 00:14:21,145
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there's a lot of, there's a lot of like other things that happen when things get wild and I'm hoping we can navigate through those without having to have y'all go by the 200 page book and read about parliamentary procedure.

187
00:14:21,285 --> 00:14:22,786
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's sort of the goal.

188
00:14:22,846 --> 00:14:25,468
[SPEAKER_05]: And if things get out of hand, we'll adjust.

189
00:14:29,332 --> 00:14:30,213
[SPEAKER_06]: approval as amended.

190
00:14:30,913 --> 00:14:32,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there any, is there anything missing?

191
00:14:32,495 --> 00:14:43,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, um, so motion to approve as amended by Mayor Lungo-Koehn, seconded by Nicole.

192
00:14:46,146 --> 00:14:47,627
[SPEAKER_05]: Back to my list.

193
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:48,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn?

194
00:14:48,608 --> 00:14:48,828
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

195
00:14:49,709 --> 00:14:50,630
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Edward Vinson?

196
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:52,351
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

197
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,232
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Galluzzi?

198
00:14:53,432 --> 00:14:53,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

199
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:54,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Cushing?

200
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:54,894
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

201
00:14:55,154 --> 00:14:55,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Marta?

202
00:14:55,554 --> 00:14:56,055
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

203
00:14:56,135 --> 00:14:56,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Libby?

204
00:14:56,635 --> 00:14:56,815
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

205
00:14:59,079 --> 00:14:59,359
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

206
00:15:01,461 --> 00:15:01,921
[SPEAKER_05]: Maria?

207
00:15:02,061 --> 00:15:02,341
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

208
00:15:02,561 --> 00:15:03,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Brian?

209
00:15:03,662 --> 00:15:04,203
[SPEAKER_05]: Tracy?

210
00:15:04,383 --> 00:15:04,643
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

211
00:15:04,963 --> 00:15:05,363
[SPEAKER_05]: Emily?

212
00:15:05,503 --> 00:15:05,724
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

213
00:15:05,884 --> 00:15:06,484
[SPEAKER_05]: Nicole?

214
00:15:06,544 --> 00:15:06,764
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

215
00:15:07,205 --> 00:15:07,525
[SPEAKER_05]: Aaron?

216
00:15:07,585 --> 00:15:07,825
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

217
00:15:08,185 --> 00:15:08,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Luke?

218
00:15:09,146 --> 00:15:09,386
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

219
00:15:09,746 --> 00:15:10,067
[SPEAKER_05]: Jenny?

220
00:15:10,307 --> 00:15:10,587
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

221
00:15:11,167 --> 00:15:13,489
[SPEAKER_05]: 15 in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

222
00:15:13,969 --> 00:15:15,310
[SPEAKER_05]: The rules have been adopted.

223
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:17,031
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

224
00:15:18,326 --> 00:15:22,928
[SPEAKER_05]: Item number four is, oh, sorry.

225
00:15:23,228 --> 00:15:25,809
[SPEAKER_05]: Also under item number three is the onboarding checklist.

226
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:40,676
[SPEAKER_05]: So on the next page, what we tried to do was just create like a little checklist of like the kinds of things that we're going to want to remember to do when somebody new joins this committee, which is somewhat inevitable and things that we want to make sure this group has,

227
00:15:42,825 --> 00:15:44,186
[SPEAKER_05]: has done and is comfortable with.

228
00:15:44,246 --> 00:15:49,850
[SPEAKER_05]: So open meeting law training, for those of you who were here last week, you went through open meeting law training.

229
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:56,074
[SPEAKER_05]: We will send you like a little thing to attest that you did it just so we can put it in the file and move on.

230
00:15:56,634 --> 00:16:09,303
[SPEAKER_05]: If you missed it, there is training offered by the attorney general's office and we'll get the presentation from Janelle at KP and make sure that you all have what you need just so that you understand sort of the role open meeting law plays.

231
00:16:10,383 --> 00:16:12,964
[SPEAKER_05]: our SBC rules, which we just adopted.

232
00:16:14,285 --> 00:16:19,828
[SPEAKER_05]: We would want to make sure new members get an overview of the MSDA process, which we did in the last meeting.

233
00:16:21,308 --> 00:16:22,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone will get an email address.

234
00:16:23,469 --> 00:16:24,690
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we're still working on that.

235
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:25,890
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that right, Dr. Cushing?

236
00:16:27,231 --> 00:16:31,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so you all, if you don't already have an MPS email address, you will get one.

237
00:16:33,074 --> 00:16:39,538
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, highly encourage that all communications about the SPC happen via that email.

238
00:16:39,578 --> 00:16:48,602
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, if you use your personal email to do this, sort of open up your personal email to records requests, so it is not recommended.

239
00:16:49,023 --> 00:16:49,783
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.

240
00:16:53,306 --> 00:16:54,187
[SPEAKER_09]: work for the district.

241
00:16:54,447 --> 00:16:55,428
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's do a full name.

242
00:16:55,628 --> 00:16:56,269
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep, we will.

243
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:59,032
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there, and Larry, your email is still active.

244
00:16:59,052 --> 00:16:59,713
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still active.

245
00:16:59,953 --> 00:17:00,553
[SPEAKER_09]: So you're good.

246
00:17:00,573 --> 00:17:05,659
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there anyone else that previously may have had a published email with us?

247
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,181
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, just need to know.

248
00:17:08,682 --> 00:17:08,942
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

249
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:17,487
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, we'll make sure people have access to the MSBA website and our School Building Authority website.

250
00:17:18,668 --> 00:17:23,152
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is a bit of work in progress, but I'm expecting we'll be able to look at it at the next meeting.

251
00:17:24,013 --> 00:17:27,456
[SPEAKER_05]: We talked a little bit about that at our communications meeting, so more on that in just a second.

252
00:17:29,658 --> 00:17:34,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, we'll provide people a meeting schedule and add people to our distribution list.

253
00:17:34,162 --> 00:17:35,123
[SPEAKER_05]: Robert's was in order.

254
00:17:35,143 --> 00:17:41,368
[SPEAKER_05]: An email to everybody else to introduce a new member so that everybody knows who to expect.

255
00:17:42,169 --> 00:17:48,754
[SPEAKER_05]: This acronym listing is obviously quite short, and I'm sure it will get much, much longer before we're done.

256
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:52,758
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that's sort of like our brief onboarding checklist.

257
00:17:53,098 --> 00:17:54,799
[SPEAKER_05]: The other thing that we talked about was

258
00:17:56,710 --> 00:18:04,952
[SPEAKER_05]: collecting up exemplar documents from other districts so we can start to look at like how other people are navigating this process.

259
00:18:05,432 --> 00:18:25,278
[SPEAKER_05]: Stone and Belmont, Arlington, Somerville, Winchester, and possibly Mohawk as a vocational school are some places that we would like to go out and sort of collect that information and make it available, not just to the members of this group, but to other members of the community who might be interested in sort of taking a deep dive into

260
00:18:26,465 --> 00:18:31,548
[SPEAKER_05]: the phase that we're at or what we're up to and how other communities are handling these documents.

261
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:37,210
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's our onboarding checklist.

262
00:18:37,731 --> 00:18:40,032
[SPEAKER_05]: Any questions, thoughts, Tom?

263
00:18:40,072 --> 00:18:50,357
[SPEAKER_09]: Just to offer one correction on Scrivener's error, I think, Jenny, but under important websites, I think we mean to say BedfordSBC website as opposed to SBA website.

264
00:18:50,477 --> 00:18:50,817
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

265
00:18:53,819 --> 00:18:54,079
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

266
00:18:57,381 --> 00:18:59,542
[SPEAKER_00]: Any other questions, comments, thoughts?

267
00:19:02,164 --> 00:19:02,484
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

268
00:19:03,465 --> 00:19:10,969
[SPEAKER_07]: When we met, we sort of felt like this would be a living document rather than something to get through.

269
00:19:11,209 --> 00:19:25,778
[SPEAKER_07]: As we move through the process, like, you know, when we've got shovels in the ground, some of these things may be irrelevant, but we want to make sure that it's not overwhelming, but actually appropriate for something to do.

270
00:19:27,835 --> 00:19:28,195
[SPEAKER_07]: seats.

271
00:19:28,556 --> 00:19:33,818
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, I don't know if that was actually written somewhere.

272
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:36,780
[SPEAKER_07]: It is at the bottom right.

273
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,141
[SPEAKER_07]: So we would just modify as we did.

274
00:19:39,161 --> 00:19:46,025
[SPEAKER_07]: So anything that you think should be there, should let Jamie or me or somebody else add it.

275
00:19:46,565 --> 00:19:49,067
[SPEAKER_07]: It has to be a meeting conversation.

276
00:19:49,287 --> 00:19:50,587
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

277
00:19:53,349 --> 00:19:55,050
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there questions, things that look

278
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:59,015
[SPEAKER_00]: Maria, just a question about that list of exam blasts.

279
00:19:59,035 --> 00:19:59,835
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

280
00:20:00,355 --> 00:20:09,637
[SPEAKER_00]: How is there a limit on how many years since they built their buildings that we should limit it to within the last five years?

281
00:20:10,237 --> 00:20:11,198
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, anything like that?

282
00:20:11,238 --> 00:20:15,439
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, I think ideally, they would be close in time.

283
00:20:15,459 --> 00:20:20,280
[SPEAKER_05]: But Winchester, I think is a little bit further out.

284
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,661
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think the thing that intrigued me about Winchester was like, they're like,

285
00:20:25,728 --> 00:20:36,070
[SPEAKER_05]: their overhaul of the building was maybe possibly something that would be similar to what happens here, where like the facade changed and they did it in state.

286
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:42,171
[SPEAKER_05]: So there might just be something interesting there, but I think they were like a little bit further back than some of the others.

287
00:20:42,271 --> 00:20:49,013
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think Stoneham's right in the middle of their process, Arlington is, Belmont is, so the rest of them are all very recent.

288
00:20:49,033 --> 00:20:53,794
[SPEAKER_05]: But Winchester sort of jumped out at me because it's like a building I know with my eye that

289
00:20:54,654 --> 00:21:00,956
[SPEAKER_05]: has gone through like sort of started out looking a little bit like our building and has gone through that restoration.

290
00:21:01,236 --> 00:21:03,137
[SPEAKER_08]: Luke?

291
00:21:03,557 --> 00:21:08,258
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

292
00:21:08,338 --> 00:21:11,019
[SPEAKER_08]: Adelbar on what?

293
00:21:11,439 --> 00:21:12,039
[SPEAKER_04]: Admit it man.

294
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:15,340
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a question too Jenny.

295
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:15,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

296
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Is the idea that they're in close proximity, I know Adelbar will change that, is the idea that they're in close proximity or

297
00:21:22,332 --> 00:21:35,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Ideally, yes, but they don't have to be if like we know of a district that has gone through this and like, particularly the ones where it went smoothly, maybe like those documents are the ones I want to see.

298
00:21:35,323 --> 00:21:39,566
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I know, obviously, obvious to me, Fuller River went through where they kept their field house.

299
00:21:39,686 --> 00:21:42,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's like a, okay, something that may be relevant to us.

300
00:21:42,829 --> 00:21:43,949
[SPEAKER_04]: And they just opened, right?

301
00:21:44,049 --> 00:21:45,370
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, probably a year ago.

302
00:21:46,431 --> 00:21:49,153
[SPEAKER_06]: Nattleboro is around the same population.

303
00:21:49,834 --> 00:21:49,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

304
00:21:52,369 --> 00:21:52,649
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

305
00:21:54,831 --> 00:21:56,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Other thoughts about this checklist?

306
00:21:58,634 --> 00:22:05,239
[SPEAKER_05]: The other thing that I think might be helpful is it's not as easy as you might think to find some of these exemplar documents.

307
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:09,722
[SPEAKER_05]: So Tom, I think we started creating a folder.

308
00:22:09,762 --> 00:22:11,363
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how far we got.

309
00:22:11,684 --> 00:22:12,444
[SPEAKER_09]: I would have to check.

310
00:22:12,484 --> 00:22:13,745
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been a couple of weeks.

311
00:22:14,506 --> 00:22:14,666
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

312
00:22:14,766 --> 00:22:15,767
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll check on it next time.

313
00:22:16,724 --> 00:22:30,536
[SPEAKER_05]: If there's anybody who's willing to, like, take on one of these communities and go find their documents, that would be amazing, because I think the quicker we can sort of pull all these into some place, like, the more accessible it will be for everybody.

314
00:22:30,556 --> 00:22:36,241
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know if there's any volunteers to take on going to track down Luke.

315
00:22:36,861 --> 00:22:37,202
[SPEAKER_08]: I have.

316
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:37,882
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

317
00:22:40,495 --> 00:22:40,755
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

318
00:22:41,315 --> 00:22:46,298
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you can send those my way, I'll get them dropped in the, I'll get them to Tom.

319
00:22:46,358 --> 00:22:47,918
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll get them to Tom so they can be shared.

320
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:51,540
[SPEAKER_05]: Anybody else?

321
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:51,940
[SPEAKER_05]: Aaron?

322
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:52,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

323
00:22:52,601 --> 00:22:53,561
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

324
00:22:55,002 --> 00:22:58,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Aaron will go digging, for example, our documents.

325
00:22:58,443 --> 00:23:00,825
[SPEAKER_05]: Does anybody want to sign on to help Aaron?

326
00:23:02,025 --> 00:23:03,106
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

327
00:23:03,246 --> 00:23:05,187
[SPEAKER_08]: Which documents?

328
00:23:16,902 --> 00:23:21,846
[SPEAKER_05]: I think for right now, what I'm particularly interested in is their eligibility-based documents, right?

329
00:23:21,926 --> 00:23:28,531
[SPEAKER_05]: So the same documents we're going to have to send in, like, they have to be in the public record somewhere.

330
00:23:30,032 --> 00:23:33,275
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think if you look at a project that's just about done, those documents are going to be

331
00:23:34,369 --> 00:23:35,930
[SPEAKER_05]: pretty well varied, I'm guessing.

332
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:38,692
[SPEAKER_05]: So it might just take a little bit of digging to find.

333
00:23:38,712 --> 00:23:44,035
[SPEAKER_05]: But I would be interested in what did other people put in their educational profile?

334
00:23:44,095 --> 00:23:55,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that's a pretty meaty document, and I'm interested in what all goes in there, because that could give us good inspiration when we start reviewing our educational profile.

335
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:58,624
[SPEAKER_05]: The same thing with the Chapter 74 form.

336
00:23:58,664 --> 00:24:02,206
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are the two big ones in the eligibility phase.

337
00:24:09,651 --> 00:24:28,104
[SPEAKER_07]: They were remarkably like- they reached out a whole bunch of other projects they were involved with, and I was looking for rules, so I didn't ask about any of the documents.

338
00:24:40,548 --> 00:24:42,929
[SPEAKER_05]: I would assume they have access to them.

339
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:43,429
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

340
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:46,171
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

341
00:24:48,412 --> 00:24:50,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Other questions about onboarding?

342
00:24:50,733 --> 00:24:50,773
[SPEAKER_05]: No?

343
00:24:55,895 --> 00:24:56,195
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

344
00:24:57,176 --> 00:25:05,179
[SPEAKER_05]: So then we'll move on to item number four, which is review and amend proposed communications and community engagement strategy for the eligibility phase.

345
00:25:07,728 --> 00:25:16,615
[SPEAKER_05]: So the communications and community engagement team met and actually I thought we had like a really fun discussion of some of the opportunities that we have.

346
00:25:17,718 --> 00:25:43,981
[SPEAKER_05]: um particularly sort of focused around the eligibility phase so um the first thing is like first draft of the website um our website will be connected to the mps website so it's not a standalone you know thing with a separate architecture it'll um it'll be connected um we have a dedicated domain um it is it all of our sites are secure so all of that should be fine um the basic structure that we landed on was like

347
00:25:44,561 --> 00:25:47,382
[SPEAKER_05]: a welcome page, like welcome and why, like why are we doing this?

348
00:25:48,243 --> 00:25:53,285
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll, so Tom and I will work on penning something for that page.

349
00:25:53,465 --> 00:26:00,048
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll have a meetings page where like you can go get all the meeting doc, agendas and minutes and all that good stuff.

350
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:08,499
[SPEAKER_05]: A news page where like when we submit documents where we're doing press releases that all of that can sort of live.

351
00:26:10,041 --> 00:26:15,729
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll have a documents space so that as we finish and complete documents they can be posted.

352
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:21,531
[SPEAKER_05]: Bios for all of you will also be available on the site.

353
00:26:22,211 --> 00:26:31,433
[SPEAKER_05]: And then finally FAQs, which we'll talk about in just a second, but you know, ultimately sort of an evolving list of answers to questions people want to know about what we're up to.

354
00:26:31,453 --> 00:26:33,414
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that make sense so far?

355
00:26:33,434 --> 00:26:36,214
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the website sort of broadly.

356
00:26:37,274 --> 00:26:39,295
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we did talk about like

357
00:26:40,171 --> 00:26:56,706
[SPEAKER_05]: some of our community engagement opportunities in the eligibility base specifically because I think people are really excited to be part of the things that are going to happen a little bit further down the line like focus groups with students, focus groups with teachers, focus groups community members, but like it's going to take some time for us to get there.

358
00:26:56,726 --> 00:27:01,070
[SPEAKER_05]: And so in this eligibility phase we talked about a couple of things.

359
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:03,192
[SPEAKER_05]: One was a community survey

360
00:27:04,979 --> 00:27:07,981
[SPEAKER_05]: where we would collect some information.

361
00:27:08,101 --> 00:27:20,491
[SPEAKER_05]: So the questions that we have on our list is, you know, we want to answer your questions, so tell us, what questions do you have about the building committee itself and what questions do you have about the eligibility process?

362
00:27:20,691 --> 00:27:26,396
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to know what kind of features are important to you, so tell us, like, what do you see in a reimagined Medford High School just to, like,

363
00:27:27,003 --> 00:27:30,065
[SPEAKER_05]: get everybody sort of thinking and excited about that?

364
00:27:30,245 --> 00:27:32,407
[SPEAKER_05]: And what suggestions do you have for the building committee?

365
00:27:33,227 --> 00:27:33,908
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell us who you are.

366
00:27:33,928 --> 00:27:36,689
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you a caregiver, a student, a resident, MPS faculty?

367
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:38,430
[SPEAKER_05]: What neighborhood are you from?

368
00:27:40,052 --> 00:27:43,114
[SPEAKER_05]: And are you a Medford High student, past, present, or future?

369
00:27:43,914 --> 00:27:51,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to sort of get an understanding of like, is there a set of questions that's coming from primarily students, primarily faculty, et cetera?

370
00:27:53,941 --> 00:27:55,982
[SPEAKER_05]: And tell us how you want to be involved in this process.

371
00:27:56,583 --> 00:27:58,604
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to take surveys during the process.

372
00:27:58,744 --> 00:28:01,146
[SPEAKER_05]: I want a tour of MHS.

373
00:28:01,166 --> 00:28:02,967
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to know about your meetings in advance.

374
00:28:03,668 --> 00:28:05,109
[SPEAKER_05]: Just the highlights, please.

375
00:28:05,129 --> 00:28:08,752
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell us how you want to know and be involved in this process.

376
00:28:10,333 --> 00:28:23,582
[SPEAKER_05]: So one proposal that we have is to send out a community-based survey to collect some input that will help inform those FAQs and start to get people sort of thinking about the fact that this is a community-based project for everybody.

377
00:28:25,031 --> 00:28:29,796
[SPEAKER_05]: We did talk about scheduling some tours of MHS.

378
00:28:30,677 --> 00:28:36,322
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably not before the end of school this year, because I don't think there's like a single extra minute in the schedule.

379
00:28:36,382 --> 00:28:39,726
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, really thinking about like, as we

380
00:28:40,366 --> 00:28:53,056
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that would be very appealing to people who don't spend any time in this building or don't have kids in this building yet to be able to come in and see like, what are we talking about here?

381
00:28:53,497 --> 00:28:57,460
[SPEAKER_05]: They know what it looks like outside, maybe they know what the pool looks like, et cetera.

382
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:03,505
[SPEAKER_05]: But is there some sort of curated tour we can provide people so people start to get an understanding of what this building is?

383
00:29:03,645 --> 00:29:05,406
[SPEAKER_05]: And frankly, what some of the challenges are.

384
00:29:05,446 --> 00:29:08,349
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that needs to be baked into any sort of

385
00:29:08,969 --> 00:29:10,730
[SPEAKER_05]: tour that we're doing.

386
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:24,493
[SPEAKER_05]: We did talk about being willing to do more staff meetings with your team so if there is another staff meeting coming up for the end of the year or even next year that you want us to participate in you can do that.

387
00:29:25,394 --> 00:29:31,876
[SPEAKER_05]: We did talk we had this Luke had this great idea there's apparently a video from this back in the 70s when Medford High opened

388
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:43,769
[SPEAKER_05]: and that it would be really cool to do some sort of like then and now of like what these spaces look like and how they've aged since the 70s.

389
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:53,598
[SPEAKER_05]: And Maria is also in the middle of digitizing yearbooks so she has some history of the old old MHS pre-fire.

390
00:29:54,638 --> 00:29:55,980
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we talked about this as like

391
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:11,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe a program for, you know, potentially our vocational students to get involved in creating something that would be available for us for like really marketing purposes as we go.

392
00:30:11,878 --> 00:30:13,580
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, nothing that has to be done.

393
00:30:14,241 --> 00:30:19,944
[SPEAKER_05]: before the end of June, but these kinds of cool creative things obviously take time.

394
00:30:20,004 --> 00:30:27,007
[SPEAKER_05]: So really thinking about how do we start to create some energy around what's happening in the building and what the potential is.

395
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:37,292
[SPEAKER_05]: We did talk about developing a roadshow presentation, and Nicole and Marissa Desmond volunteered to work on a draft of that.

396
00:30:37,632 --> 00:30:40,994
[SPEAKER_05]: We think that content will change all the time, but we do anticipate

397
00:30:41,744 --> 00:30:44,986
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot of reasons to go tell people what's happening here.

398
00:30:45,106 --> 00:31:01,898
[SPEAKER_05]: And so whether it's at school committee, whether the council wants to be briefed on a regular basis, whether we're talking to community groups, like we want there to be some common set of talking points so that any member of this committee could say, yes, I'm available on that day.

399
00:31:01,998 --> 00:31:06,141
[SPEAKER_05]: I can go do that talk and sort of carry forward for the committee.

400
00:31:07,368 --> 00:31:30,733
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple of other things we talked about, certainly including some periodic updates in the Superintendent's Weekly Update, but also investigating some sort of, like, register your email to subscribe to this particular kind of news, which will be important for people who maybe don't have kids in MPS right now and aren't seeing the Superintendent's Weekly Updates but might be interested in this.

401
00:31:31,821 --> 00:31:44,565
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we also talked about for the website, creating a roadmap that's visual that demonstrates like what, where are we in the process and what steps have we already completed and what's next.

402
00:31:44,765 --> 00:31:46,206
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's something that we'll work on.

403
00:31:48,037 --> 00:31:59,846
[SPEAKER_05]: Maria is going to collect some info for us so that we can start to have tables at some of the community-based events like the Farmers Market, Family Concert Series, Circled Square, those kinds of things.

404
00:32:00,026 --> 00:32:05,931
[SPEAKER_05]: And so once we get there, we may want to have some poster boards of what NHS looks like.

405
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:19,869
[SPEAKER_05]: something visual about our roadmap and where we are, but really just to be there to answer questions and create interest in the community and encourage people to be part of this process.

406
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:27,814
[SPEAKER_05]: Any questions about that in terms of our communication plan and strategy in the eligibility phase?

407
00:32:29,255 --> 00:32:29,495
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

408
00:32:30,316 --> 00:32:32,097
[SPEAKER_07]: The event table, I like that a lot.

409
00:32:32,197 --> 00:32:34,899
[SPEAKER_07]: I do think there are a number of businesses

410
00:32:35,718 --> 00:32:44,184
[SPEAKER_07]: get a lot of foot traffic where we put things up as well, like Colleen's scoops.

411
00:32:44,364 --> 00:32:50,488
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, there's probably others as well, be very supportive and have a lot of foot traffic.

412
00:32:50,669 --> 00:32:51,829
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I mean, I'm shocked.

413
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:53,310
[SPEAKER_07]: My daughter works with colleagues.

414
00:32:53,711 --> 00:32:55,872
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm shocked how many people are in and out of that place.

415
00:32:56,353 --> 00:32:57,774
[SPEAKER_07]: It's wild.

416
00:32:58,254 --> 00:32:59,515
[SPEAKER_07]: So, okay.

417
00:32:59,535 --> 00:33:02,077
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think that's a great idea.

418
00:33:02,297 --> 00:33:02,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Luke?

419
00:33:04,454 --> 00:33:10,499
[SPEAKER_08]: So up in the sports leagues, there's a lot of parents.

420
00:33:10,939 --> 00:33:20,868
[SPEAKER_08]: First graders, second graders, third graders.

421
00:33:21,388 --> 00:33:27,533
[SPEAKER_08]: And at some point, all the various institutions, they could be a strong advocacy group.

422
00:33:27,593 --> 00:33:30,415
[SPEAKER_08]: So we somehow connected with that.

423
00:33:30,656 --> 00:33:31,476
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

424
00:33:31,777 --> 00:33:33,278
[SPEAKER_08]: Various sports groups.

425
00:33:34,264 --> 00:33:35,464
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think that's a great idea.

426
00:33:35,864 --> 00:33:49,307
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think some of the youth sports organizations will have a vested interest in what becomes of the property as well, because they rely on the fields and that kind of thing.

427
00:33:49,408 --> 00:33:51,568
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's actually a great idea.

428
00:33:51,748 --> 00:33:52,408
[SPEAKER_05]: We can add that.

429
00:33:52,568 --> 00:33:52,928
[SPEAKER_05]: Tracy?

430
00:33:53,969 --> 00:34:00,150
[SPEAKER_11]: One thing that stuck out that I want, also internal but external, is this reimagined improvised school.

431
00:34:00,751 --> 00:34:06,437
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder if we can make a collective determination of how the committee is going to talk about it during this meeting.

432
00:34:06,817 --> 00:34:07,958
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it reimagining it?

433
00:34:07,998 --> 00:34:12,703
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, you don't want to go out and start out the concept, we're building new or things like that.

434
00:34:12,783 --> 00:34:13,003
[SPEAKER_11]: And so

435
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:19,326
[SPEAKER_11]: That I underlined it as I was reading it, say reimagine gives you a lot of possibility.

436
00:34:19,426 --> 00:34:29,016
[SPEAKER_11]: And if we as many when we're communicating or however we're putting it out there, we're using a certain term, whether it's reimagine or something else that we can come up with.

437
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:34,843
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're all speaking the same language when we're talking about the process that we're in.

438
00:34:36,618 --> 00:34:38,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think that's a great question.

439
00:34:39,899 --> 00:34:51,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Our website is building MHS, because building can mean like all of those things but I think reimagine is the other word that I like to use when I'm talking to people because

440
00:34:52,711 --> 00:35:08,545
[SPEAKER_05]: it what it's going to be is is not decided yet right so um and i think when people say well what's it going to look like are we going to do this or that i typically say we don't know that yet but you know part of this process is like is really

441
00:35:09,429 --> 00:35:11,471
[SPEAKER_05]: an imaginative process.

442
00:35:11,511 --> 00:35:17,236
[SPEAKER_05]: Like some of us got to see Arlington High School and we went into a room and it was called the discourse room.

443
00:35:18,357 --> 00:35:24,302
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was like a classroom, but it looked a little bit more like a college classroom.

444
00:35:25,003 --> 00:35:32,350
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was intended to be big enough for multiple classes to be in there at the same time so that you could like co-teach a lesson

445
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:43,001
[SPEAKER_05]: And there could be like a debate happening and the room was structured for that right and so that's it like an imagination like point we don't have anything like that here today.

446
00:35:44,322 --> 00:35:50,429
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's possible and not only is it possible it exists right and so really thinking about like.

447
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:58,071
[SPEAKER_05]: what is possible I think is hard to do when you are tied to a building and how it functions, right?

448
00:35:58,111 --> 00:36:09,314
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you can say like, I want the windows to open or I want the lockers to be bigger or smaller, like, but to really think about like what isn't here does take a lot of imagination.

449
00:36:09,354 --> 00:36:13,595
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think re-imagining is a good word for us to think about using.

450
00:36:13,655 --> 00:36:15,896
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if others have thoughts about that.

451
00:36:20,523 --> 00:36:20,683
[SPEAKER_09]: Tom?

452
00:36:20,863 --> 00:36:22,364
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I completely agree.

453
00:36:22,424 --> 00:36:29,468
[SPEAKER_09]: I think reimagining has been a really attractive and salient message when we're talking about this project.

454
00:36:29,548 --> 00:36:40,473
[SPEAKER_09]: I also think that when we're engaging with folks in the community and they're looking for more specificity, that's where we say, well, look, the two big buckets are rebuild or renovate, right?

455
00:36:40,513 --> 00:36:42,454
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are the two kinds of MSBA projects.

456
00:36:42,935 --> 00:36:44,696
[SPEAKER_09]: We're hoping to do one or the other.

457
00:36:45,716 --> 00:36:49,098
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's still space to be more specific, but I do think that

458
00:36:49,755 --> 00:36:52,537
[SPEAKER_09]: especially in this early stage, so much value.

459
00:36:52,557 --> 00:36:55,200
[SPEAKER_09]: It's an imaginative process.

460
00:36:55,240 --> 00:37:01,325
[SPEAKER_09]: Like you said, Jenny, it's really talking about what is here that we care about and want to preserve.

461
00:37:02,746 --> 00:37:14,336
[SPEAKER_09]: And the things that we do like about the space, as much as we talk about the things that need to be remedied, there are things about this building that we like and that the community values.

462
00:37:14,376 --> 00:37:16,658
[SPEAKER_09]: But then also thinking bigger.

463
00:37:19,701 --> 00:37:20,941
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we change programming?

464
00:37:20,981 --> 00:37:22,662
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we expand certain programming?

465
00:37:22,702 --> 00:37:25,023
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we move things around in a different way?

466
00:37:25,363 --> 00:37:27,063
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are all imaginative questions.

467
00:37:27,103 --> 00:37:31,025
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would certainly be in favor of emphasizing that reimagining.

468
00:37:31,605 --> 00:37:33,366
[SPEAKER_08]: Luke?

469
00:37:33,386 --> 00:37:41,428
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's also the bureaucratic aspect of the public space where we're laying bureaucratic foundation.

470
00:37:41,468 --> 00:37:41,989
[SPEAKER_08]: Correct.

471
00:37:42,609 --> 00:37:49,411
[SPEAKER_08]: We're creating tools, we're formalizing

472
00:37:56,992 --> 00:38:04,578
[SPEAKER_08]: is the big snow, which is truly, I think, where creative juices are intact.

473
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:20,672
[SPEAKER_08]: And we have a professional design and planning team that's brought on board, split on retainer, give it a job of locating that what's here.

474
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:24,035
[SPEAKER_08]: We're trying to set up the acreage

475
00:38:26,303 --> 00:38:41,970
[SPEAKER_08]: And then what levels of replacement or renovation, and that's where the imagination really kicks in.

476
00:38:43,191 --> 00:38:47,172
[SPEAKER_08]: So I totally agree with reimagining.

477
00:38:47,212 --> 00:38:53,475
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a good catch-all for the general process, but there is a sort of bureaucratic aspect.

478
00:38:55,646 --> 00:39:05,032
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and I think what I tell people about eligibility is like, we've got to get through this in order to get on to answering the questions you really want to know about.

479
00:39:05,873 --> 00:39:16,200
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we're going to move as quickly as we can through this eligibility phase so that we can start the real engagement and the imagination about what this could be.

480
00:39:18,341 --> 00:39:19,802
[SPEAKER_05]: A third question.

481
00:39:22,124 --> 00:39:23,505
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for that.

482
00:39:24,485 --> 00:39:25,366
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the things that I

483
00:39:25,885 --> 00:39:37,590
[SPEAKER_07]: worry about is the people who are like coming at us with stuff about the feasibility of reimagining they want to do now is, you know, when we get through that gate, we'll get through it.

484
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:38,330
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

485
00:39:38,611 --> 00:39:39,491
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, we will.

486
00:39:39,511 --> 00:39:41,292
[SPEAKER_07]: We're getting through that gate.

487
00:39:42,632 --> 00:39:55,238
[SPEAKER_07]: It isn't the time to then start engaging the community to start thinking about reimagining because like the race began and catching all those people in their reimaginings and interests

488
00:39:55,990 --> 00:40:09,616
[SPEAKER_07]: even though we can't do anything with them right now, so that on day one of that process, they're all queued up, ready to be hauled, because, well, I mean, it is just a lot of paperwork right now.

489
00:40:11,036 --> 00:40:18,200
[SPEAKER_07]: If we don't hook them and keep up, because frankly, none of them are probably interested in paperwork.

490
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,301
[SPEAKER_07]: On day one, I mean, I know, when I run for office,

491
00:40:24,628 --> 00:40:31,871
[SPEAKER_07]: two full years, I have people contact me and they support me, and then time to start my campaign up and I'm like, who are all those people again?

492
00:40:33,432 --> 00:40:44,856
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just don't want us to, I mean, I don't know if we create a shared document where we just add names of people who have interests, maybe a little note, how did you meet them?

493
00:40:44,896 --> 00:40:45,937
[SPEAKER_07]: What was their interest?

494
00:40:46,157 --> 00:40:48,238
[SPEAKER_07]: So that when we have a reason to meet them,

495
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:55,035
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not all just like digging through our memories of this long process of reading documents.

496
00:40:55,956 --> 00:41:00,560
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know that my own, like, intent to do that every day falls flat.

497
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:05,625
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think about that as a committee, something to formalize.

498
00:41:08,496 --> 00:41:12,220
[SPEAKER_05]: We did talk about creating a mail list, essentially.

499
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:26,773
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's the place for capturing those folks, because we can create the list in such a way that you can tell us what you want to know about, and also, what else do you want us to keep in mind about you?

500
00:41:27,354 --> 00:41:31,698
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we have that running list, and people can self-subscribe.

501
00:41:31,898 --> 00:41:32,119
[SPEAKER_05]: Luke?

502
00:41:38,683 --> 00:41:39,184
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

503
00:41:39,204 --> 00:41:42,229
[SPEAKER_08]: We're talking about surveys.

504
00:41:42,269 --> 00:41:44,613
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of part of our work here.

505
00:41:44,893 --> 00:41:51,825
[SPEAKER_08]: But certainly identifying specific people and affirming that they want to come back with us.

506
00:42:05,288 --> 00:42:06,689
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think that's a great suggestion.

507
00:42:06,749 --> 00:42:10,292
[SPEAKER_05]: So I will, I've got that on my list to add.

508
00:42:11,532 --> 00:42:14,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Other thoughts about the community engagement piece so far?

509
00:42:14,735 --> 00:42:16,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Maria?

510
00:42:16,656 --> 00:42:19,678
[SPEAKER_00]: Back to what Doug mentioned about sports teams.

511
00:42:19,738 --> 00:42:20,018
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

512
00:42:21,259 --> 00:42:29,144
[SPEAKER_00]: My mind jumped to the PTOs because it's not only they're a powerful group, but it's a way to reach everyone who's in schools.

513
00:42:29,667 --> 00:42:38,954
[SPEAKER_00]: but also the Catholic schools, private schools, the local charter schools, because if we want to bring people back, they're the ones that have less of what these are enough.

514
00:42:39,915 --> 00:42:40,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

515
00:42:40,475 --> 00:42:40,856
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

516
00:42:41,436 --> 00:42:42,397
[SPEAKER_05]: I will put that on the list.

517
00:42:43,258 --> 00:42:53,826
[SPEAKER_06]: Just feel free to tap into the city side as well, because of course it's important for families to want to be involved, but I think we need to build excitement amongst the entire community.

518
00:42:53,866 --> 00:42:56,148
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm not going to help robocalls, newsletters,

519
00:42:56,987 --> 00:42:58,449
[SPEAKER_06]: start building that excitement.

520
00:42:58,689 --> 00:43:01,411
[SPEAKER_06]: So I need everybody's support.

521
00:43:01,492 --> 00:43:03,554
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, we can do that.

522
00:43:07,517 --> 00:43:16,446
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of the city side of things, we also talked about how best to engage our boards and commissions because there's a huge number of boards and commissions across the city.

523
00:43:17,276 --> 00:43:41,921
[SPEAKER_05]: some of which have like lots of obvious touch points with this school building committee and others maybe not as obvious but maybe there are some that we're not thinking about so we will build a separate survey for them for the boards and commissions to say does your board or commission have an overlapping and or aligned interest in our SBC if so please describe at what phase in the process should we reach out to you

524
00:43:42,944 --> 00:43:45,366
[SPEAKER_05]: to your board and commission for that sort of integration?

525
00:43:45,866 --> 00:43:47,007
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the best way to reach you?

526
00:43:47,087 --> 00:43:48,568
[SPEAKER_05]: And do you have any questions for us?

527
00:43:49,249 --> 00:43:54,132
[SPEAKER_05]: And then also offer to hold some, hold informal sessions for those boards and commissions.

528
00:43:54,172 --> 00:43:57,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Like they may say, can you come speak at a board meeting?

529
00:43:57,034 --> 00:44:06,121
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll have this like little roadshow presentation that we can bring with us and somebody can go and speak to them and sort of bring back to the group like what they talked about.

530
00:44:06,861 --> 00:44:12,305
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the idea of like how to make sure we're casting sort of a wide net across our boards and commissions.

531
00:44:13,125 --> 00:44:26,355
[SPEAKER_05]: I would also like in my mind, I know REC has a board now, but we would also be trying to tap into the folks at Medford REC because they obviously have another like sort of another vested interest in what's going on here.

532
00:44:26,375 --> 00:44:28,256
[SPEAKER_08]: Luke?

533
00:44:40,273 --> 00:44:45,277
[SPEAKER_08]: because there are organizations that are possibly outside of our community.

534
00:44:46,018 --> 00:44:46,559
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

535
00:44:46,739 --> 00:44:54,005
[SPEAKER_08]: That rent community buildings, fields, on a regular basis, on a regular basis.

536
00:44:54,486 --> 00:44:54,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

537
00:44:54,866 --> 00:45:07,037
[SPEAKER_08]: And in terms of engaging there is, is there already a concept for how to sort of see if there is a community there?

538
00:45:11,021 --> 00:45:12,801
[SPEAKER_08]: or is there uncertainty?

539
00:45:13,282 --> 00:45:20,603
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think there might need to be some sort of slightly different survey for them, much like there's something different for the boards and commissions.

540
00:45:20,683 --> 00:45:33,867
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe we can talk about that in our next, we have another communications meeting coming up, but we can talk about that in our next meeting and just figure out like, you know, how do we properly like get them into the fold as well?

541
00:45:33,987 --> 00:45:34,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I think you're right.

542
00:45:35,507 --> 00:45:55,066
[SPEAKER_05]: there's this building is never quiet ever right so even when school's not happening something's happening in this building more than likely so just you know i think that is a actually a really good point i mean i'm aware of some uh just an idea of who all

543
00:45:59,404 --> 00:46:13,133
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure yeah I'm sure we have a list we'll have to work on whether it's an actual list or if it's a lot of things all over the place that we have to pull together but yeah yeah.

544
00:46:14,794 --> 00:46:15,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Questions Larry?

545
00:46:16,595 --> 00:46:20,177
[SPEAKER_03]: This may be stupid but get used to it.

546
00:46:20,237 --> 00:46:25,861
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you all seen the cooking shows where they give the guys a grocery card

547
00:46:26,525 --> 00:46:30,266
[SPEAKER_03]: and they have to use certain ingredients to make the best thing they can.

548
00:46:32,547 --> 00:46:45,790
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems to me what would be helpful early on, and I don't know that this has a particular application to your specific comments today, but I would like to know what we have to work with in terms of sites in the city.

549
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:52,952
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to know specifically, I have some questions about this building having been in and out for 10 years.

550
00:46:54,147 --> 00:46:56,548
[SPEAKER_03]: Peter and I have discussed it on a couple of occasions.

551
00:46:57,388 --> 00:47:01,930
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I gave a superintendent a paper maybe a year or so ago.

552
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:08,573
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that idea you mentioned earlier of a tour might be good for this committee.

553
00:47:08,613 --> 00:47:09,713
[SPEAKER_13]: For this group as well.

554
00:47:09,933 --> 00:47:10,813
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think that's a great idea.

555
00:47:10,833 --> 00:47:13,334
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's just be honest with the good, bad, young.

556
00:47:13,895 --> 00:47:15,235
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, what do we have here, really?

557
00:47:15,715 --> 00:47:16,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

558
00:47:16,916 --> 00:47:22,558
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't have most of the answers, but I think I have a few things that I'm certainly concerned about.

559
00:47:25,194 --> 00:47:32,075
[SPEAKER_03]: One being subterranean groundwater, the fells, which is caused, I believe it's exacerbated a lot of the structural settling.

560
00:47:32,496 --> 00:47:35,716
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's just kind of leave that there for now.

561
00:47:35,796 --> 00:47:40,118
[SPEAKER_03]: But maybe it can be remediated, you know.

562
00:47:40,218 --> 00:47:51,941
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just think if everybody's kind of up to speed on what we have here, and there are some environmental, shall we say, things that can be dealt with.

563
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:54,082
[SPEAKER_03]: if we stay in this building.

564
00:47:54,903 --> 00:48:02,373
[SPEAKER_03]: But additionally, like the other pieces of property that could be available, can, you know, can we squeeze a little more out of the bells?

565
00:48:02,834 --> 00:48:08,942
[SPEAKER_03]: Could we have a loop around and maybe integrate, particularly if we're going to have a lot more sports things here and somehow

566
00:48:10,335 --> 00:48:14,036
[SPEAKER_03]: have access to the soccer fields below the synagogue down there.

567
00:48:14,456 --> 00:48:15,816
[SPEAKER_03]: What about Playstead Park?

568
00:48:15,996 --> 00:48:20,417
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's just, and then what about the whole thing of Hormel Stadium?

569
00:48:20,517 --> 00:48:25,098
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's a big, nice piece of valuable property sitting there that doesn't get used very often.

570
00:48:25,278 --> 00:48:33,519
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is worth a lot of money, a lot of money, because potentially it can help finance some other things we're doing elsewhere.

571
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:36,240
[SPEAKER_03]: I think of the tax revenue perspective.

572
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:42,063
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be great if you had a bunch of people, say, in high-end condoms.

573
00:48:42,263 --> 00:48:43,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that that's not suggested.

574
00:48:43,744 --> 00:48:46,005
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just trying to, like, what are we dealing with here?

575
00:48:46,025 --> 00:48:47,066
[SPEAKER_03]: What do we have to work with?

576
00:48:47,646 --> 00:48:48,787
[SPEAKER_03]: What are our options?

577
00:48:49,668 --> 00:48:50,988
[SPEAKER_03]: And thinking outside the box.

578
00:48:51,088 --> 00:48:53,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe this site, maybe not, maybe a couple sites.

579
00:48:55,811 --> 00:49:00,574
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's, I want to know what ingredients we have to make the recipe.

580
00:49:01,488 --> 00:49:01,968
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that.

581
00:49:02,088 --> 00:49:03,189
[SPEAKER_05]: So two things.

582
00:49:03,309 --> 00:49:12,136
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a meeting on six, four, and I think having a tour of this building during that meeting makes a lot of sense.

583
00:49:12,596 --> 00:49:13,877
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll put that on our agenda.

584
00:49:14,837 --> 00:49:17,539
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have a finance subcommittee meeting before that.

585
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:24,204
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think the finance subcommittee includes more of the city staff, like Bob and Fiona, et cetera.

586
00:49:24,224 --> 00:49:30,929
[SPEAKER_05]: And so my goal for that meeting is for us to be talking about the, you know, just sort of

587
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:42,587
[SPEAKER_05]: getting to a place where we understand better what kind of funding needs to be set aside for feasibility study and for what, so that we can be ready to work with the council to do that.

588
00:49:43,008 --> 00:49:52,154
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think the other question we can put on their agenda is like, what are those possibilities across the city that this group needs to know about and start to be able to think about?

589
00:49:53,455 --> 00:49:53,855
[SPEAKER_05]: I can do that.

590
00:49:54,376 --> 00:49:54,596
[SPEAKER_08]: Luke?

591
00:50:01,502 --> 00:50:07,585
[SPEAKER_08]: formal RFP process or collect the bids so that we know what it costs.

592
00:50:08,325 --> 00:50:14,728
[SPEAKER_08]: Only now, if somebody's delivering the bids, this particular project is done.

593
00:50:14,788 --> 00:50:15,928
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully, it's three.

594
00:50:15,988 --> 00:50:18,289
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there something else?

595
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:20,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, people are chomping at the bit for this project.

596
00:50:22,991 --> 00:50:29,654
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so once we get through this, the first thing that we do is we put out an RFP to bring on our OPM.

597
00:50:30,532 --> 00:50:33,374
[SPEAKER_05]: And that OPM has to be done by competitive bid.

598
00:50:33,534 --> 00:50:35,716
[SPEAKER_05]: They're also chomping at the bit to be part of this.

599
00:50:37,317 --> 00:50:47,543
[SPEAKER_05]: But what we have to do before we can even get there is demonstrate to MSBA that we have a pot of money set aside that is reasonable to cover

600
00:50:49,475 --> 00:50:51,097
[SPEAKER_05]: what will be the feasibility study.

601
00:50:51,117 --> 00:50:54,001
[SPEAKER_05]: So that includes the OPM and then ultimately the feasibility study.

602
00:50:54,562 --> 00:51:04,515
[SPEAKER_05]: So the mayor will need to send something to the council that says this is how much money that we're going to set aside and this is where it's going to come from and then the council will need to take a vote.

603
00:51:04,935 --> 00:51:10,719
[SPEAKER_05]: how we think that's going to happen is that that money will be moved into the newly created stabilization fund.

604
00:51:10,759 --> 00:51:25,850
[SPEAKER_05]: So there'll be an earmark of like this is money for the feasibility study for MSBA and it will get moved into the stabilization fund so it's there and it's ready for us when we are ready for it rather than waiting for free cash to come all the way back around sometime around now next year.

605
00:51:26,590 --> 00:51:30,432
[SPEAKER_05]: that has to be in place before MSBA will move us on to the next step.

606
00:51:30,512 --> 00:51:33,073
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're working through the mechanics of that.

607
00:51:33,394 --> 00:51:35,335
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've been in touch with the president of the council.

608
00:51:35,395 --> 00:51:36,535
[SPEAKER_05]: So he knows it's coming.

609
00:51:38,256 --> 00:51:42,278
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, we have some flexibility because there's not a vote required.

610
00:51:42,298 --> 00:51:46,881
[SPEAKER_05]: There's not a city wide vote required to fund the feasibility study.

611
00:51:47,121 --> 00:51:49,982
[SPEAKER_05]: So that will that will come from our free cash reserves.

612
00:51:50,042 --> 00:51:50,963
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's been our plan.

613
00:51:52,104 --> 00:51:52,884
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

614
00:51:53,490 --> 00:51:57,551
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, regards to feasibility studies, I've had some limited experience.

615
00:51:57,871 --> 00:52:00,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of them, of course, have been in free enterprise.

616
00:52:00,332 --> 00:52:02,713
[SPEAKER_03]: So they have to do with, is this going to be profitable?

617
00:52:02,913 --> 00:52:04,453
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we sell it?

618
00:52:04,914 --> 00:52:06,634
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a big part of it.

619
00:52:06,694 --> 00:52:07,714
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little different.

620
00:52:07,874 --> 00:52:10,875
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not saying we shouldn't have a feasibility study.

621
00:52:10,915 --> 00:52:11,716
[SPEAKER_03]: We really should.

622
00:52:11,736 --> 00:52:15,057
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think we can do a lot of the initial homework ourselves.

623
00:52:15,237 --> 00:52:18,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody knows what's more feasible than the people in this room.

624
00:52:19,178 --> 00:52:22,639
[SPEAKER_03]: And nobody knows, like I was saying about the ingredients, what's available.

625
00:52:23,129 --> 00:52:27,391
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's get it as far as we can before we turn it over to them.

626
00:52:27,431 --> 00:52:30,632
[SPEAKER_03]: Because all they're going to do is ask us all the same questions we're asking each other.

627
00:52:31,212 --> 00:52:35,273
[SPEAKER_05]: So MSBA requires a certain process.

628
00:52:35,573 --> 00:52:40,615
[SPEAKER_05]: And that process really is like you can't sort of jump the line through their steps.

629
00:52:40,735 --> 00:52:48,298
[SPEAKER_05]: So our goal needs to be to bring those feasibility folks on as quickly as possible and be ready to hand them something.

630
00:52:48,338 --> 00:52:48,998
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's right.

631
00:52:49,358 --> 00:52:50,579
[SPEAKER_05]: really important idea.

632
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:59,323
[SPEAKER_05]: But more importantly, like we need to get them on the bus as quickly as we can so that they can make progress because we could hand them a whole thing.

633
00:52:59,703 --> 00:53:01,904
[SPEAKER_05]: They're still going to do it again because they have to.

634
00:53:01,964 --> 00:53:09,948
[SPEAKER_05]: That's part of the like prescription of the MSBA process is that there's no jumping the line, so to speak.

635
00:53:11,909 --> 00:53:13,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Or we could pre-think through things.

636
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:13,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

637
00:53:14,261 --> 00:53:15,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, absolutely.

638
00:53:15,101 --> 00:53:16,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Jenny.

639
00:53:16,522 --> 00:53:21,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I just feel like as a communications professional, like we're going all over the place a little bit.

640
00:53:22,024 --> 00:53:40,271
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're helping to find out what questions should maybe be on the website that people wanna have answers to, but I would think just for like folks following along at home or just all of us trying to follow along, make sure, are we still on the communications or are we just kind of like going a little bit here or there just with general questions, which I totally get, but as far as...

641
00:53:41,277 --> 00:53:43,498
[SPEAKER_04]: bring it back to the communications and community engagement.

642
00:53:43,538 --> 00:53:43,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

643
00:53:44,279 --> 00:53:47,461
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we probably veered off track a little bit, but that's okay.

644
00:53:47,481 --> 00:53:49,082
[SPEAKER_05]: We're back.

645
00:53:50,062 --> 00:54:01,829
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the other thing that we did talk a little bit about is that there is a question on the educational profile that does say like, what is your communication strategy during this time period?

646
00:54:02,630 --> 00:54:03,731
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we have a couple of

647
00:54:05,202 --> 00:54:10,124
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a couple of thoughts there about how we are going to answer this question.

648
00:54:11,464 --> 00:54:18,567
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll certainly like sort of make this outline of what we plan to do a little bit jazzier and more cohesive.

649
00:54:18,587 --> 00:54:24,809
[SPEAKER_05]: And that will go in there, as well as describe some of the topics where we're expecting school committee engagement.

650
00:54:24,869 --> 00:54:28,930
[SPEAKER_05]: So for example, at our next meeting, which is on the 20th,

651
00:54:31,011 --> 00:54:44,560
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Fallon will be bringing forward a conversation about expansion of certain vocational programs that they'll be seeking support from the school committee, like sort of to green light those ideas.

652
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:54,787
[SPEAKER_05]: That's important for us to do and for us to take a vote on at school committee so that then it can be incorporated into our chapter 74 profile before it goes in.

653
00:54:54,967 --> 00:54:58,429
[SPEAKER_05]: There's also a conversation tomorrow, is it tomorrow?

654
00:55:04,145 --> 00:55:08,828
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's Wednesday.

655
00:55:08,968 --> 00:55:09,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Wednesday.

656
00:55:10,008 --> 00:55:26,516
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a special education subcommittee meeting of the school committee on Wednesday, and that group will be talking about the possible inclusion of the Curtis Tufts program to the campus through this project.

657
00:55:28,176 --> 00:55:29,117
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think, you know,

658
00:55:30,282 --> 00:55:40,549
[SPEAKER_05]: we are all feeling like there's an opportunity to create increased educational opportunities for our students at Curtis Tufts by co-locating them here.

659
00:55:42,010 --> 00:55:52,537
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're in a way that still like meets their needs because they do have a particular, like a sort of a different set of needs than being in a gen ed setting.

660
00:55:52,997 --> 00:55:56,019
[SPEAKER_05]: So how do you sort of do both of those things is an important question.

661
00:55:56,860 --> 00:55:59,762
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've asked the special education subcommittee, which is chaired by Paul,

662
00:56:00,402 --> 00:56:06,646
[SPEAKER_05]: to explore that with students and members of the staff and come back to the school committee with a recommendation.

663
00:56:06,686 --> 00:56:13,970
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if that group sort of recommends that this is not a good idea, we should not pursue this, then we would not put it in our educational profile.

664
00:56:14,010 --> 00:56:20,274
[SPEAKER_05]: But if they confirm that there is broad agreement, then we would make sure that that programming is in here as well.

665
00:56:20,994 --> 00:56:37,002
[SPEAKER_05]: We actually have a Medford resident who runs Somerville's sort of similar program and he happened to be at our meeting last week when we put the need for that meeting to happen on the agenda and he had just a million amazing things to say about

666
00:56:39,028 --> 00:56:49,959
[SPEAKER_05]: the benefits for students in the Somerville program, how the program has expanded, how this student participation in athletics has increased and all the rest.

667
00:56:50,019 --> 00:56:59,008
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think we're all thinking there will be like a pretty favorable outcome from that, but that is another place where we're asking the school committee to get engaged in something.

668
00:56:59,609 --> 00:57:02,231
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the last thing is we'll have, I think it's next week,

669
00:57:04,193 --> 00:57:15,025
[SPEAKER_05]: a meeting, a school committee meeting about our capital planning process, and that has to be sort of tightened up and in good order before we put in our maintenance documents.

670
00:57:15,546 --> 00:57:18,569
[SPEAKER_05]: So all of those things are happening at the school committee, so we'll wrap all of that in as well.

671
00:57:18,929 --> 00:57:19,130
[SPEAKER_08]: Luke?

672
00:57:19,931 --> 00:57:22,113
[SPEAKER_08]: So there is a lot of discussion

673
00:57:36,654 --> 00:57:38,876
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure, we can do that.

674
00:57:40,857 --> 00:57:41,497
[SPEAKER_07]: Paul?

675
00:57:42,838 --> 00:57:48,242
[SPEAKER_07]: The very stuff is just part of the ISP.

676
00:57:49,843 --> 00:57:52,765
[SPEAKER_07]: But it seems different because it's a separate program.

677
00:57:52,785 --> 00:57:55,387
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got its own name, and it's in a different location.

678
00:57:55,527 --> 00:57:56,708
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's part of it.

679
00:57:57,628 --> 00:58:02,932
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that's how we're going to dodge that point.

680
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:05,488
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope it won't be a problem.

681
00:58:05,668 --> 00:58:08,410
[SPEAKER_05]: And the program today is how many students, Lori?

682
00:58:09,291 --> 00:58:10,932
[SPEAKER_06]: On the rules, 15.

683
00:58:10,972 --> 00:58:10,932
15.

684
00:58:11,312 --> 00:58:19,418
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're not talking about true consolidation that many communities go through.

685
00:58:19,638 --> 00:58:19,858
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

686
00:58:19,878 --> 00:58:21,940
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

687
00:58:23,721 --> 00:58:28,685
[SPEAKER_05]: Other questions about the communication and community engagement plan?

688
00:58:33,593 --> 00:58:39,196
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, is there a motion to approve the communication and community engagement plan as amended by our discussion?

689
00:58:39,376 --> 00:58:41,777
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, okay.

690
00:58:41,857 --> 00:58:46,019
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion approved by Mayor Longo Kern, seconded by Emily.

691
00:58:46,039 --> 00:58:49,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, let's see.

692
00:58:49,241 --> 00:58:49,661
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor?

693
00:58:50,061 --> 00:58:50,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

694
00:58:51,322 --> 00:58:52,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Edward Vincent?

695
00:58:52,743 --> 00:58:52,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

696
00:58:53,063 --> 00:58:53,903
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Galluzzi?

697
00:58:54,003 --> 00:58:54,224
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

698
00:58:54,664 --> 00:58:55,304
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Cushing?

699
00:58:55,504 --> 00:58:55,744
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

700
00:58:56,285 --> 00:58:56,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Marta?

701
00:58:56,945 --> 00:58:57,385
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

702
00:58:57,425 --> 00:58:57,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Libby?

703
00:58:58,166 --> 00:58:58,346
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

704
00:58:58,566 --> 00:58:59,066
[SPEAKER_05]: Marissa?

705
00:59:00,807 --> 00:59:00,987
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

706
00:59:02,884 --> 00:59:03,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Maria.

707
00:59:03,384 --> 00:59:03,825
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

708
00:59:04,045 --> 00:59:04,625
[SPEAKER_05]: Brian.

709
00:59:04,745 --> 00:59:04,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

710
00:59:05,206 --> 00:59:05,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Tracy.

711
00:59:05,926 --> 00:59:06,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

712
00:59:06,426 --> 00:59:06,827
[SPEAKER_05]: Emily.

713
00:59:06,907 --> 00:59:07,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

714
00:59:07,427 --> 00:59:07,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Nicole.

715
00:59:08,108 --> 00:59:08,328
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

716
00:59:08,728 --> 00:59:09,128
[SPEAKER_05]: Aaron.

717
00:59:09,168 --> 00:59:09,408
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

718
00:59:09,569 --> 00:59:09,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Luke.

719
00:59:10,930 --> 00:59:11,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Jenny.

720
00:59:11,390 --> 00:59:11,630
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

721
00:59:12,350 --> 00:59:14,352
[SPEAKER_05]: 15 on the affirmative, zero on the negative.

722
00:59:16,333 --> 00:59:17,414
[SPEAKER_05]: The plan is approved.

723
00:59:19,463 --> 00:59:21,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, we're making good time.

724
00:59:21,345 --> 00:59:23,108
[SPEAKER_05]: It's seven o'clock.

725
00:59:23,568 --> 00:59:33,261
[SPEAKER_05]: The last thing on the agenda was just to give you all a first draft look at one of our deliverables.

726
00:59:33,382 --> 00:59:35,364
[SPEAKER_05]: So as you know, there's

727
00:59:36,149 --> 00:59:38,692
[SPEAKER_05]: There's five deliverables that we need to submit.

728
00:59:39,133 --> 00:59:42,057
[SPEAKER_05]: The first one is an agreement that has been submitted and complete.

729
00:59:42,637 --> 00:59:46,943
[SPEAKER_05]: The second one is a list of all of your names that will be done before we meet next.

730
00:59:47,764 --> 00:59:52,751
[SPEAKER_05]: The third one is the educational profile and that one really sets like sort of the vision for like

731
00:59:53,371 --> 00:59:55,011
[SPEAKER_05]: What do we do in this building and how do we do it?

732
00:59:55,272 --> 00:59:57,452
[SPEAKER_05]: Both today and how do we want to do it in the future?

733
00:59:58,672 --> 01:00:07,454
[SPEAKER_05]: And then because we have such a big vocational program, item number four is this chapter 74 viability program document.

734
01:00:08,815 --> 01:00:11,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Fifth one is the authorization to fund the feasibility study.

735
01:00:12,836 --> 01:00:18,617
[SPEAKER_05]: The reason that we're sort of, I won't say we're out of order, but we're starting with vocational first because this document is the most complete

736
01:00:19,494 --> 01:00:31,424
[SPEAKER_05]: the vocational programs have sort of the luxury, I guess, in this process of having already customized things happening in each of their programs.

737
01:00:32,285 --> 01:00:40,172
[SPEAKER_05]: So where on the comprehensive side, on the sort of traditional side of the high school, there's sort of big, broad questions about like,

738
01:00:41,238 --> 01:00:55,163
[SPEAKER_05]: How, how are we teaching and how might we do things differently the vocational programs all have that customization sort of implicit in their programming and a lot of it is driven by what chapter 74 which governs all of our vocational programs sort of requires.

739
01:00:56,081 --> 01:01:02,984
[SPEAKER_05]: So what this document requires us to do is give them some information about our programs.

740
01:01:03,004 --> 01:01:11,467
[SPEAKER_05]: So on the second page, what you can see here is a list of programs that we have that are existing.

741
01:01:13,328 --> 01:01:19,931
[SPEAKER_05]: You can also see that we have our current enrollment for 23-24 listed.

742
01:01:20,111 --> 01:01:24,333
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is our current enrollment in the program for each program.

743
01:01:26,037 --> 01:01:28,198
[SPEAKER_05]: And then a column for proposed capacity.

744
01:01:28,958 --> 01:01:37,762
[SPEAKER_05]: So there are a handful of programs where we are, we believe that after our school committee meeting next week that we will be seeking some.

745
01:02:20,728 --> 01:02:29,041
[SPEAKER_12]: mentioned up certain programs because there is weight there there's a waitlist that's

746
01:04:35,951 --> 01:04:41,554
[SPEAKER_12]: And I see that you scroll down a little bit.

747
01:04:41,574 --> 01:04:41,814
[SPEAKER_02]: Monday.

748
01:05:07,413 --> 01:05:13,896
[SPEAKER_01]: and what the staffing commitment would be to

749
01:05:41,450 --> 01:05:42,210
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

750
01:05:42,410 --> 01:05:43,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

751
01:06:13,243 --> 01:06:22,949
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that all.

752
01:07:03,328 --> 01:07:10,352
[SPEAKER_01]: And the third thing I want to do is talk about some of the things that we've done in the past.

753
01:07:10,812 --> 01:07:23,020
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to talk a little bit about what we've done in the past, and then I'm going to talk a little bit about what we've done in the future.

754
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:27,082
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to talk a little bit about what we've done in the past, and then I'm going

755
01:07:35,783 --> 01:07:41,609
And I think that's one of the things that we need to do.

756
01:07:42,310 --> 01:07:54,243
And I think that's one of the things that we need to do.

757
01:08:01,374 --> 01:08:02,856
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need to do anything.

758
01:08:02,957 --> 01:08:05,380
It's just a hobby.

759
01:08:05,420 --> 01:08:05,941
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a hobby.

760
01:08:52,176 --> 01:08:52,376
Thank you.

761
01:09:36,997 --> 01:09:43,519
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if my flash came on.

762
01:09:43,559 --> 01:09:50,061
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

763
01:11:06,681 --> 01:11:07,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

764
01:11:36,513 --> 01:11:36,573
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh.

765
01:12:13,034 --> 01:12:15,415
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

766
01:12:36,689 --> 01:12:37,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, people.

767
01:13:03,041 --> 01:13:08,543
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's something that I just want someone to educate me on.

768
01:13:28,624 --> 01:13:36,266
[SPEAKER_11]: if we are offering that offer, does that change the scope of this document or to lift it up?

769
01:13:36,626 --> 01:13:40,507
[SPEAKER_11]: Or I may be going on to expand.

770
01:13:40,727 --> 01:13:42,968
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, we have done it before, right?

771
01:13:43,008 --> 01:13:54,651
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have had students from other schools tuition in to our program, but the demand here is that we don't have the space for that anymore.

772
01:13:55,431 --> 01:14:19,409
[SPEAKER_05]: um talk a little bit about like how what is the right mix of like accounting for that possibility and i think um that's a question for this group to really think about i mean trying to build capacity for a revenue generating program is going to come at a cost which isn't necessarily a bad thing but um

773
01:14:20,490 --> 01:14:31,276
[SPEAKER_05]: It also, there's not a super clear pipeline of how many tuitions could count on in a year.

774
01:14:31,376 --> 01:14:42,282
[SPEAKER_05]: So we don't know that we necessarily land anywhere, but just to say that our first priority for this group has to be our students.

775
01:14:42,982 --> 01:14:48,826
[SPEAKER_05]: And half of that, half of every class is deciding to go into a vocational program.

776
01:14:49,546 --> 01:14:57,593
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's in part because it's not, the vocational programs are not what you think of as the vocational programs from when you went to school.

777
01:14:57,633 --> 01:14:58,955
[SPEAKER_05]: They're quite different now.

778
01:14:59,795 --> 01:15:02,337
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a tremendous number of them.

779
01:15:02,438 --> 01:15:07,982
[SPEAKER_11]: As you know, all you know, I'm building a new building and it's coming with all new bills and business.

780
01:15:08,523 --> 01:15:11,325
[SPEAKER_11]: And everybody is talking, can we rent it?

781
01:15:11,426 --> 01:15:13,627
[SPEAKER_11]: Can we get into, what can we do?

782
01:15:13,948 --> 01:15:15,970
[SPEAKER_11]: And when I see this data that there was one time,

783
01:15:17,276 --> 01:15:30,519
[SPEAKER_11]: an opportunity for our district that has the latest model, whatever equipment and people find out about it, can we come over and use that equipment?

784
01:15:30,739 --> 01:15:41,702
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want us to think about as we think about how big this department is going to be, this part of the building is going to be, that there is going to be that desire to want to

785
01:15:43,243 --> 01:15:43,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

786
01:15:44,223 --> 01:15:45,804
[SPEAKER_05]: I knew you were going to have something to say.

787
01:15:47,405 --> 01:15:48,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this goes way back.

788
01:15:48,785 --> 01:15:59,409
[SPEAKER_03]: But when I first started teaching here, it was my understanding it would cost $56,000 a year just to send a kid to win a man to have him plumbing.

789
01:16:00,129 --> 01:16:09,372
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we go down that road, it should be nice if there was some sort of standardized fee schedule.

790
01:16:09,392 --> 01:16:10,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Or then I think also, Chad,

791
01:16:11,243 --> 01:16:12,143
[SPEAKER_10]: There is for the state.

792
01:16:12,204 --> 01:16:13,124
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all done.

793
01:16:13,144 --> 01:16:15,785
[SPEAKER_10]: Minimum until $30,000 right now for the capital expense.

794
01:16:16,045 --> 01:16:17,286
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah, that's good.

795
01:16:17,466 --> 01:16:18,707
[SPEAKER_10]: We're the cheapest in the state.

796
01:16:18,907 --> 01:16:23,229
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't really know the calculation parts, but sending towns and sending kids here for $10,000 is $7.

797
01:16:23,289 --> 01:16:23,989
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.

798
01:16:24,009 --> 01:16:29,212
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you have 20 to 25 extra kids?

799
01:16:29,652 --> 01:16:32,114
[SPEAKER_10]: I sure did bring kids in, and it was nice.

800
01:16:32,354 --> 01:16:38,697
[SPEAKER_10]: Keep in mind, as we're doing this work, there are 15,000 kids statewide who don't get into any CTE spot.

801
01:16:39,192 --> 01:16:49,439
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's fun to think about if we were at a spot where we could bring in 10 students a year, all we're doing is helping our surrounding communities of kids that can't get into Minuteman because of the waiting list.

802
01:16:49,639 --> 01:16:50,940
[SPEAKER_10]: They can't get into Northeast.

803
01:16:51,700 --> 01:16:53,361
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, I think that's something to think about.

804
01:16:53,401 --> 01:16:56,063
[SPEAKER_10]: But to your question, Larry, yeah, it's all covered by the state.

805
01:16:56,083 --> 01:16:56,944
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all calculated.

806
01:16:56,964 --> 01:16:58,725
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not really sure how, but.

807
01:16:59,125 --> 01:16:59,385
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

808
01:17:02,067 --> 01:17:02,928
[SPEAKER_08]: Just a quick question.

809
01:17:03,548 --> 01:17:04,128
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

810
01:17:04,148 --> 01:17:04,288
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi.

811
01:17:04,589 --> 01:17:07,811
[SPEAKER_08]: This past weekend, I was talking to Mr. Christensen about robots.

812
01:17:08,647 --> 01:17:11,448
[SPEAKER_08]: And he indicated that there was a pretty substantial weakness.

813
01:17:12,008 --> 01:17:13,368
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what kind of weakness.

814
01:17:13,388 --> 01:17:15,349
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's about a year.

815
01:17:15,729 --> 01:17:19,550
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's about nine years.

816
01:17:19,590 --> 01:17:22,730
[SPEAKER_08]: But he just said, oh, we've got a weakness.

817
01:17:22,951 --> 01:17:26,271
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so I'm just looking at it.

818
01:17:26,311 --> 01:17:28,932
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be in the latest.

819
01:17:29,212 --> 01:17:31,433
[SPEAKER_10]: I spelled it all the wrong way.

820
01:17:31,693 --> 01:17:33,193
[SPEAKER_10]: It's also generic.

821
01:17:33,233 --> 01:17:35,094
[SPEAKER_10]: But it will be broken down, probably, with K-11.

822
01:17:37,675 --> 01:17:40,456
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll have to feed all of that back into this before it's done.

823
01:17:41,256 --> 01:17:41,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Paul?

824
01:17:41,997 --> 01:17:52,241
[SPEAKER_07]: The other thing about having space for kids from other communities, and I believe this happened with Everett, I don't know if this is before your time, but we have them.

825
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:53,501
[SPEAKER_07]: Everett is coming.

826
01:17:53,961 --> 01:17:57,703
[SPEAKER_07]: And Everett is like, wow, we're sending, I don't know, 10 kids over to Medford.

827
01:17:57,723 --> 01:17:59,223
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe we should have our own program.

828
01:17:59,323 --> 01:18:03,305
[SPEAKER_07]: They start their own program, and then suddenly we don't have those 10 kids all at once.

829
01:18:03,445 --> 01:18:05,245
[SPEAKER_07]: Like this year, we no longer have them.

830
01:18:07,819 --> 01:18:17,661
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not a risk-free thing to build capacity for surrounding communities, especially if they have any capability to actually do it themselves.

831
01:18:18,081 --> 01:18:23,182
[SPEAKER_07]: If they don't have a case, if they don't have a vocational school at all, obviously the risks are very different.

832
01:18:23,282 --> 01:18:35,145
[SPEAKER_07]: But when they have something, or it's a program where the upfront costs are not exorbitant, just need a teacher, those I think of as more risky because it's not

833
01:18:35,836 --> 01:18:38,077
[SPEAKER_07]: they just, they would want to keep their money too.

834
01:18:39,719 --> 01:18:49,825
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, there's no easy path, but like, I don't know if plumbing is one of the ones where there's no way to send kids anywhere.

835
01:18:49,845 --> 01:19:01,012
[SPEAKER_07]: Figuring out how to get a plumber to teach would be a problem, but there are opportunities, but they're not all risk-free.

836
01:19:06,611 --> 01:19:07,591
[SPEAKER_12]: Are there questions, Luke?

837
01:19:07,912 --> 01:19:12,213
[SPEAKER_08]: So I have a question about part C, question one.

838
01:19:12,253 --> 01:19:18,836
[SPEAKER_08]: So the reply only happens when part of the scope is reflected on the partnership.

839
01:19:18,936 --> 01:19:22,917
[SPEAKER_08]: And so it's required to the same type of services.

840
01:19:22,977 --> 01:19:29,320
[SPEAKER_08]: It's also missing cybersecurity, which I'm sure you're thinking about this week, though.

841
01:19:29,340 --> 01:19:34,302
[SPEAKER_08]: So one part of IT systems, I think, might get banned for cyber

842
01:19:36,860 --> 01:19:37,880
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure, you can do that.

843
01:19:37,980 --> 01:19:40,301
[SPEAKER_08]: Questions, thoughts, things you're wondering about.

844
01:20:04,696 --> 01:20:06,199
[SPEAKER_05]: Terms of our vocational programs.

845
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:08,925
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things that was sort of interesting is like this does.

846
01:20:09,696 --> 01:20:22,539
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, there's a completely separate track that we would have to pursue with DESE to be approved to have these programs, which is sort of separate and apart from like having the space to have the program, which is what MSBA is here to do.

847
01:20:22,639 --> 01:20:30,320
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's sort of a different work stream that would have to sort of move alongside of us, but more on the administration side.

848
01:20:31,421 --> 01:20:37,042
[SPEAKER_05]: But the other thing that if you look at section C, if you're adding new programs,

849
01:20:38,018 --> 01:20:49,061
[SPEAKER_05]: it does ask a series of questions to make sure that what you're adding is in alignment with what your area requires.

850
01:20:49,161 --> 01:21:02,625
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you were like, well, I have an agricultural program, and you look around the immediate area, and there's no call for that in the field, then MSBA and DEFI, because DEFI will review and approve this as well, will say no.

851
01:21:04,645 --> 01:21:06,586
[SPEAKER_05]: you can do that, but we're not going to pay for it, right?

852
01:21:06,666 --> 01:21:20,248
[SPEAKER_05]: So Chad did look at the regional blueprints in terms of like getting to this, cultivating this list of programs that we're going to potentially seek to expand because these are the ones that are supported by our regional blueprint.

853
01:21:20,488 --> 01:21:25,829
[SPEAKER_05]: And so there's sort of a, I'll say a straighter line there in terms of what we might be able to offer.

854
01:21:29,810 --> 01:21:33,671
[SPEAKER_05]: Other questions, thoughts, comments about this form?

855
01:21:36,294 --> 01:21:37,375
[SPEAKER_05]: the easier of the two.

856
01:21:37,495 --> 01:21:40,857
[SPEAKER_05]: So I thought we'd start here.

857
01:21:41,537 --> 01:21:48,262
[SPEAKER_05]: If any of you have questions or thoughts as you're reading this, as you're thinking about it, can they send them to you, Chad?

858
01:21:48,462 --> 01:21:48,742
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

859
01:21:48,962 --> 01:21:52,684
[SPEAKER_05]: So Chad will take your individual questions and comments.

860
01:21:53,765 --> 01:22:02,651
[SPEAKER_05]: On Monday at the school committee, Chad will be presenting about this, about the potential expansion of the particular programs.

861
01:22:03,591 --> 01:22:07,156
[SPEAKER_05]: And you all are welcome at the school committee meeting all the time.

862
01:22:07,196 --> 01:22:08,898
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure it will be another lively meeting.

863
01:22:08,918 --> 01:22:14,025
[SPEAKER_05]: We will try to schedule the agenda such that Chad doesn't have to be there all night.

864
01:22:14,986 --> 01:22:15,787
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll look at that.

865
01:22:16,668 --> 01:22:21,154
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, ideally the presentation will go well and the school committee will

866
01:22:22,082 --> 01:22:31,604
[SPEAKER_05]: take a vote to approve support of Chad's plan that he's going to outline for us, and then we can include that in this before you all see it again when we finalize.

867
01:22:32,044 --> 01:22:32,264
[SPEAKER_05]: Peter?

868
01:22:32,764 --> 01:22:35,985
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a specific MSBA language for how a vote should be?

869
01:22:36,345 --> 01:22:43,147
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it just says that they need to provide a copy of the meeting minutes, which include the language and outcome of the vote.

870
01:22:48,081 --> 01:22:52,923
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and it does say to be studied as part of the feasibility study for the proposed project.

871
01:22:52,943 --> 01:22:54,023
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll like craft.

872
01:22:54,423 --> 01:22:55,764
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll craft a motion that.

873
01:22:57,224 --> 01:22:58,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Wraps all those buzzwords in.

874
01:23:01,086 --> 01:23:03,347
[SPEAKER_05]: Other questions about this document?

875
01:23:03,367 --> 01:23:06,928
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

876
01:23:08,548 --> 01:23:11,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Feel free to reach out to Chad if you have any other thoughts.

877
01:23:12,490 --> 01:23:12,730
[SPEAKER_05]: Um.

878
01:23:16,147 --> 01:23:19,970
[SPEAKER_05]: cfallon at medford.k12.ma.us.

879
01:23:21,070 --> 01:23:23,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Once you all have your email addresses, you'll be able to find him in the directory.

880
01:23:23,552 --> 01:23:27,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Our next meetings.

881
01:23:30,019 --> 01:23:36,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Our next full committee meeting is on June 4th here, so we will plan a tour of Medford High.

882
01:23:37,786 --> 01:23:50,098
[SPEAKER_05]: We will hopefully approve our Chapter 74 form for submission, and we'll do a first review of the educational profile, and I will do my level best to make sure you have that a couple of days ahead of time so you don't have to speed read on the fly.

883
01:23:51,119 --> 01:23:54,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so all of that to come for June 4th.

884
01:23:55,001 --> 01:24:00,723
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and then, um, our subcommittee, we have another communications and community engagement subcommittee.

885
01:24:00,743 --> 01:24:05,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Now that we have sort of the support of this group, we'll get working on some of the

886
01:24:05,985 --> 01:24:08,886
[SPEAKER_05]: the surveying and that kind of thing, so that can get ready.

887
01:24:09,006 --> 01:24:14,569
[SPEAKER_05]: And then also before our next full committee meeting is a finance subcommittee meeting.

888
01:24:15,509 --> 01:24:21,992
[SPEAKER_05]: For those of you who weren't here the last time, if you are interested in being part of any of the subcommittees, you can just let me know and we'll add you to the list.

889
01:24:22,393 --> 01:24:29,576
[SPEAKER_05]: Provided that there's not too many people on the list, folks are welcome to join any of those subcommittees.

890
01:24:29,596 --> 01:24:33,998
[SPEAKER_05]: So, so far we have rules and onboarding, communications and community engagement, and then finance.

891
01:24:35,798 --> 01:24:43,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, any other questions before we make a motion to adjourn?
