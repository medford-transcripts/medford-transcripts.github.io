    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=250.04s">Anthony,</a>  congratulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=251.741s">On</a>  behalf of the Medford City Council, Anthony, it's my privilege to present you with this citation, which reads, the Medford City Council takes pleasure in awarding this council commendation to Anthony Petrellis. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=261.509s">Whereas</a>  Anthony Petrellis has been named the 2014 Millikan Educator Award recipient, and whereas the Millikan Educator Award is a national accolade awarded to only 40 educators nationwide annually. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=273.747s">And</a>  whereas Anthony Petrellis is the sole educator from the state of Massachusetts to be bestowed this great honor, and where Anthony has shown an untiring commitment to the educational excellence on behalf of the city of Medford and the Medford public schools, it is with great pleasure we extend this heartfelt thank you.</p>

    <p>[Anthony Petrelis]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=298.544s">Wow,</a>  I've seen these meetings on TV. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=300.245s">I</a>  never thought I'd be on this side of the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=303.705s">I</a>  just want to thank everybody for coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=305.627s">There's</a>  a lot of great teachers here that I've learned a lot from. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=309.409s">And</a>  I appreciate it very much that I've taken a little bit from everybody and helped teach the kids at Medford and win a nice award like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=320.118s">But</a>  I owe it to my school. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=321.198s">I</a>  owe it to the teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=322.079s">I</a>  owe it to my family and friends and everybody who's around me that's helped shape me to who I am. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=327.163s">So</a>  thank you for everybody being here and everything else.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=342.948s">We're</a>  going to take a quick recess, take a couple of pictures with the recipients. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=501.334s">Councilor</a>  O'Karn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=520.25s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=520.63s">While</a>  we have Anthony here, I just want to first say I've known the Petrello's family for a very long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=527.941s">I've</a>  seen Anthony Petrellis at work, and what he does is amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=532.724s">Proud</a>  to have him as the summer instructor at the Columbus camp, and proud to have him as a teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=538.868s">And</a>  I just want to share this one story, because the city's abuzz about Anthony Petrellis the last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=546.213s">I</a>  believe it came from my mother, who speaks very highly of Anthony. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=549.796s">And</a>  she said that once you won the award, you must have been in the large auditorium with a bunch of teachers and students. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=558.025s">And</a>  somebody came up to, you know, maybe to Diane or the principal, or I'm not sure who it was, and said, where's this Anthony Petrellis? <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=565.386s">I</a>  don't see him anywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=567.407s">And</a>  somebody said, well, there he is down on the floor with the kids, like, actively participating and, you know, helping them learn. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=575.068s">And</a>  I just thought that was an amazing story. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=577.048s">So</a>  it just shows, you know, what type of teacher he is. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=580.309s">He</a>  goes above and beyond the call of duty. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=582.269s">And</a>  that's obvious from the award that was won, which I believe was only <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=587.151s">one</a>  of 25 in the nation, so I just personally want to congratulate Anthony and his family, and all the teachers and principal at the McGlynn.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=595.917s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=602.261s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=602.721s">14706,</a>  offered by Vice President Caraviello, be it resolved that the Medford City Council present a citation to commend and congratulate Bruno Bonacorsi on his recent achievement award for his 32 years of employment with Project Triangle. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=617.693s">Councilor</a>  Caravelle, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=620.414s">For</a>  those who don't know, October is National Disability Employment and Awareness Month, which is a national campaign to raise awareness about disability issues and celebrate the many and varied contributions of America's workers with disability. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=635.74s">This</a>  year's theme is Expect, Employ, and Empower. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=640.362s">In</a>  1945, Congress enacted a law declaring the first week in October each year to be the National <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=646.508s">Employee</a>  to Physically Handicapped Week. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=648.689s">However,</a>  in 1962, the word physically was removed to acknowledge the employment needs and contributions of individuals with all types of disability. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=659.196s">In</a>  1988, CARMS expanded the week to a month and changed the name to National Disability Employment Awareness Month. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=668.722s">This</a>  evening, we would like to recognize, commend and congratulate Bruno Bonacorsi <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=675.155s">on</a>  his recent achievement award for 32 years of employment with Triangle in Baltimore. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=680.317s">Triangle</a>  was founded in 1971 by individuals who believed that people with disabilities could learn and lead more independent and dignified lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=690.282s">It</a>  began serving five people with developmental needs and grew over the next decade to an employment training program for over 80 individuals. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=700.446s">Today,</a>  Triangle serves over 3,000 people in our area. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=708.376s">Bruno,</a>  who is now 58 years old, and his family are lifelong residents of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=714.981s">There</a>  aren't many in Medford who don't know Bruno, either from being on the sidelines of Mustang football games, baseball fields, St. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=722.067s">Clement</a>  Church on Saturday, where he presents the gifts to priests, or various city events. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=729.313s">After</a>  leaving Lincoln Junior High School, Bruno started his working career at the Hagner Center in Medford, and then moved on to <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=736.563s">Triangle</a>  center upon the Hegner center's closing. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=740.585s">Bruno</a>  is the model of what Triangle teaches. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=744.487s">He</a>  never misses a day of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=746.869s">And</a>  it is truly part of his daily routine. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=750.13s">Anyone</a>  driving by 226 Main Street at 7 o'clock in the morning will see this young man standing at the door with his lunch bag in his hand waiting for the van to pick him up to go to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=761.077s">And</a>  God forbid the van is late. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=764.058s">His</a>  job is his life. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=766.445s">Every</a>  week, he probably brings home his paycheck and gives it to his mother. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=771.227s">Bruno</a>  doesn't make much money, but he has learned to become a proud and productive member of our society. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=777.79s">He</a>  would work seven days a week if possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=780.531s">Everyone</a>  in this country should have his work ethic. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=783.853s">No</a>  one can really understand the obstacles that the families of people with disabilities like Bruno go through every day unless they are part of your family like Bruno was part of mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=795.483s">is</a>  the exact meaning of what National Disability Employment Awareness Month is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=801.349s">If</a>  I could ask Bruno and his mother to come up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=844.658s">The</a>  Medford City Council takes pleasure in awarding this council accommodation to Bruno Bonacorsi in recognition of Bruno's recent achievement award for his 32 years of employment with Project Triangle. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=857.581s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=877.099s">Is</a>  that better than the one the other one gave you?</p>

    <p>[ptMnNu2KUwo_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=945.646s">Thank</a>  you, Bruno.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=989.835s">That's</a>  all on the calendar. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=991.016s">If</a>  you want to bring that up, you can. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=995.197s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=995.357s">Nicole,</a>  right?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=998.698s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1000.619s">I'm</a>  not sure of his name. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1003.88s">I</a>  can't stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1005.061s">Nicole</a>  and Steve. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1006.361s">Nicole</a>  and Steve. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1007.561s">Steve.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1009.202s">Just</a>  while we have Councilor Caraviello's daughter in the audience, she's just recently engaged, so we want to congratulate her, Nicole and Steve. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1018.184s">Good</a>  luck with the wedding planning and hope you, yeah, many years together.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1025.81s">Are</a>  we getting that $21,000 raise like Boston guys? <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1037.34s">14-698</a>  offered by Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1039.122s">Be</a>  it resolved that the council commendation be sent to Frederick Lasky, executive director of the MWIRA. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1045.798s">for</a>  receiving the Norman B. Leventhal Excellence in City Building Award. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1050.9s">Fred</a>  was honored with the Environmental Award recipient for his water protection leadership at the MWRA. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1057.602s">This</a>  award also acknowledges Fred's dedication toward our region's environment while providing clean drinking water to communities throughout eastern Massachusetts.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1067.545s">Councilor</a>  Pentec. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1068.666s">Well,</a>  this is very unusual to have at a Medford City Council meeting, three acknowledgments in a row. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1074.248s">This</a>  is like a triple play. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1075.832s">This</a>  is all good news. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1077.573s">And</a>  what's going on in the world, in the city, in the town, in the states today, it's nice to have recognition for folks who really deserve it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1085.019s">We</a>  all know Fred. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1086.56s">If</a>  you don't know Fred, former member of our Medford School Committee, family man. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1091.444s">But</a>  as the executive director of the MWRA, he's the guy, unfortunately, that when you get your water bill, you think it's kind of high. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1097.048s">It's</a>  not from him. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1098.229s">He</a>  only sells it to us wholesale. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1100.171s">So</a>  it's what the city charges after the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1103.544s">The</a>  award that Fred received is kind of like unique. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1106.746s">He</a>  received it from a company called ABC. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1109.227s">And</a>  they're an independent membership-based organization here in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1114.971s">And</a>  what they do is they advance significant transportation development and environmental policies. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1121.835s">And</a>  Fred, for many years, as you know, or if you don't know, has been the executive director of the MWRA. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1127.579s">And</a>  by being there, he has brought forward many innovative and environmental-friendly <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1134.953s">management</a>  techniques as well as work techniques that have just really advanced the MWRA to be a very sophisticated, technological, and water-environmental friendly organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1145.982s">That's</a>  basically what the award was that Fred received because of his environmental participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1152.247s">And</a>  as a result of that, and knowing that his wife Donna is in the audience tonight, and once again, a teacher and a supporter of Mr. Petralas, <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1160.703s">It's</a>  just a family ongoing thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1162.723s">Um,</a>  their community driven spirit is here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1166.524s">And</a>  I think it's great that we're acknowledging three method individuals tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1170.425s">Now</a>  it's Fred Lasky's turn. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1172.386s">And</a>  I would just like to say thank you to Mr. Lasky, uh, for doing the job, um, that a lot of people probably would not want to have, but at the same time being recognized for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1182.348s">Um,</a>  because this award, uh, is a very prestigious award. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1185.288s">It's</a>  only in its fourth year of operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1188.12s">And</a>  Fred is the fourth person to get this environmental award. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1191.922s">So</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, I'd like to forward the commendation to Mr. Lasky. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1197.725s">And</a>  if he wishes, he could come before the council at a future date to receive it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1201.506s">But</a>  I didn't want any more time to go by without the acknowledgement being recognized.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1207.129s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1209.71s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1211.251s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1212.311s">And</a>  I want to thank Councilor Penta for offering this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1216.622s">He</a>  mentioned that Mr. Lasky has done yeoman's work in regards to green initiatives with the MWRA. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1225.745s">And</a>  also, Mr. President, a little-known fact that while under the leadership of Mr. Lasky, the Water Authority has grown into an establishment that provides safe drinking water to many thousands of residents of this commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1245.245s">And</a>  in addition to that, Mr. President, another little-known fact is the fact that it costs — and consumers probably wouldn't realize this, but it costs roughly one cent to get a clean gallon of drinking water to your home. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1261.534s">And</a>  that's through the hard dedication and leadership through Mr. Lasky and the whole MWRA over the years, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1269.899s">And</a>  I personally want to thank Fred. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1272.34s">I've</a>  known him for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1274.208s">As</a>  Councilor Penta mentioned, he's a great family man, and he really does a service to not only this community, but everyone in the Commonwealth by his leadership at the MWRA, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1287.856s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1291.218s">Anyone</a>  else? <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1295.361s">Okay,</a>  Mr. Clerk, did we get that? <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1297.202s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1299.263s">Suspension</a>  has been asked for by Councilor Layton for a brief announcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1304.671s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1305.691s">Thank</a>  you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1307.712s">I'd</a>  like to offer the floor to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1310.493s">Kathy</a>  Young here. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1311.253s">Kathy</a>  is a volunteer with our Office of the Environment and Energy, and she'd like to make a brief announcement about this weekend's festival. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1321.297s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1323.513s">Catherine</a>  Young, 64 Medford Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1325.215s">I</a>  want to thank the Council for the opportunity to speak and also for Councilman Knight for the invitation to mention the Harvester Energy Festival. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1334.645s">It's</a>  happening this Saturday, October 18th from 11 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1339.009s">to</a>  2 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1340.371s">I'd</a>  also like to thank Alicia Hunt for her significant amount of work to make that happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1345.836s">The</a>  Energy Committee supports that, but she put a lot of work into that, so I want to recognize that also. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1351.12s">So</a>  it's the fifth annual Harvester Energy Festival. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1353.582s">It's</a>  going to be held at Riverbend Park behind the McGlynn School from 11 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1357.905s">to</a>  2 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1359.446s">Some</a>  of the events that will occur, we will be giving out the third annual Green Awards, and those are to Medford area businesses, residents, and organizations that have taken on measures geared toward energy conservation and environmental initiatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1375.678s">We'll</a>  be giving out toys for the wind turbine. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1379.841s">That</a>  will happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1380.682s">And</a>  we'll also have some tables, educational and informational tables, for Medford students, clubs, and green businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1388.369s">We'll</a>  have a shredding truck that's returning, so people can bring their boxes of paper, anything that needs to be shredded. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1396.075s">We'll</a>  have volunteers there to help people bring it from their car to the shredder, if that's necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1403.221s">We'll</a>  have a free raffle again this year and prizes will be including compost bin, free dance lessons from Dance Caliante, sausage sandwiches from Fred's Franks. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1412.866s">They'll</a>  also be there selling food. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1416.028s">What</a>  else do we have? <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1416.728s">We</a>  have gift basket from Medford Whole Foods and a massage gift certificate from Elements Massage. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1422.191s">lots</a>  of great prizes to get people's interest and encourage people to attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1428.615s">The</a>  very popular TechniArt will be selling sets of energy-efficient lights and light bulbs again for $10. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1434.399s">They</a>  did that last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1435.159s">It's</a>  very popular. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1436.881s">That's</a>  been subsidized by National Grid, again, so that will be a popular item. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1442.224s">New</a>  this year, we're going to have the Be the Match program. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1445.426s">It's</a>  from Dana Farber. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1447.467s">And</a>  that will be typing people for bone marrow donation. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1452.171s">We</a>  thought that would be a good addition to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1454.232s">And</a>  also, they may have their blood mobile there as well, to give people an opportunity to donate blood. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1460.256s">Also</a>  new will be a bike rodeo, something great for the kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1463.899s">What</a>  this is, is it's from Safe Routes to School, that program. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1467.401s">It's</a>  children should bring their bikes and their helmets. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1470.103s">to</a>  learn about safe biking, riding, and the Medford Bike Commission will be there leading micro-tours from the festival site to assembly row and back. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1478.665s">And</a>  they'll be primarily using the shared trails. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1481.306s">It's</a>  about five miles, a round trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1483.867s">It's</a>  mostly flat, so people of all ages can participate, kids, adults, whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1489.668s">And</a>  the Bike Commission will also be valet parking your bikes. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1492.709s">It's</a>  always nice to have valet parking during the course of the festival. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1496.21s">And</a>  it's going to be a beautiful day, so I hope everyone can make it.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1500.373s">Thank</a>  you, and we look forward to seeing everyone there this weekend.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1503.215s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1507.657s">11</a>  a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1508.237s">to</a>  2 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1508.778s">on</a>  Saturday.</p>

    <p>[SkrUmad63nQ_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1509.358s">Hi,</a>  Richard Cormier, 150 Middlesex Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1516.422s">I</a>  just wanted to add to that, she mentioned the Be the Match program. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1520.244s">Many</a>  of you might know my father, Rich Cormier. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1522.446s">He</a>  was diagnosed with a blood disease, and he had to go through a stem cell transplant. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1526.748s">And</a>  it was through the Be the Match program that it's a very simple program. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1530.543s">You</a>  just go down there, you fill out some paperwork, and they swab the inside of your cheek, and that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1535.105s">Then</a>  you get put into a database, and then anywhere around the world they can end up contacting you. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1541.508s">And</a>  it used to be a difficult process. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1544.93s">Now</a>  it's a very simple process. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1546.091s">It's</a>  more just like a blood transfusion, just like when you donate any type of blood. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1549.372s">So</a>  it's very simple when you are called upon to donate stem cells, which the chances are very rare that you get called upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1556.355s">But</a>  it's a very simple process. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1560.698s">I</a>  was looking forward to people going out there and signing up. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1564.3s">And</a>  my father's doing great, by the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1566.421s">So.</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1566.561s">So</a>  your father every Sunday is good?</p>

    <p>[SkrUmad63nQ_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1567.921s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1568.081s">Doing</a>  well. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1568.462s">And</a>  he's actually, he's teaching right now through Skype. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1571.403s">He's</a>  teaching some of the kids of the Vogue through Skype. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1574.124s">They</a>  have a camera set up in the classroom and at my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1576.105s">And</a>  he's doing some teaching through that, so he can get back hopefully in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1579.527s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1580.487s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1580.948s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1583.489s">Motion</a>  by Councilor Dela Ruzzo. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1585.069s">Hold</a>  on. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1585.41s">Hold</a>  on. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1588.651s">Hold</a>  on. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1589.351s">Hold</a>  on. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1589.632s">Hold</a>  on.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1592.506s">Mr.</a>  President, I just want to echo the comments of the last two speakers regarding the Be the Match program. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1599.209s">And,</a>  you know, it's not often that you could make such a donation that is not financial in nature, but it's a donation to actually possibly save someone's life. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1611.014s">And</a>  I can't think of a better donation to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1613.555s">And</a>  as was just mentioned, it's just the swabbing of the inside of your mouth. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1618.217s">And</a>  I plan on going down. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1621.382s">this</a>  weekend, Mr. President, and I would urge residents of this community to go down and not only enjoy the event, but also take part in the Be The Match program, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1632.345s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1636.666s">Motion</a>  by Councilor Dello Russo to revert back to regular business. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1639.107s">14-699,</a>  offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that Waste Management perform a comprehensive inspection of the vehicles used for trash <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1650.783s">and</a>  recycling pickup in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1653.085s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1654.466s">Thank</a>  you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1656.728s">In</a>  recent weeks, I've gotten a number of calls relative to what I guess would be labeled trash truck slime leaking out of the trash trucks, causing a little bit of a problem relative to quality of life in certain neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1669.039s">I've</a>  gotten a number of calls from the Lawrence Street neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1673.183s">It's</a>  also happened right in my own backyard, Mr. President, along Winthrop Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1676.8s">We've</a>  seen it on Spring Street as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1678.22s">So</a>  I'd ask that Waste Management do an inspection of their vehicles to ensure that they're not leaking any trash and refuse and fluid onto our streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1685.882s">I</a>  think it may pose a significant public health hazard, but more or less it's really just a quality of life issue.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1691.483s">Okay,</a>  we'll move forward something on, we'll have the clerk move something on to Waste Management.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1699.305s">Councilor</a>  Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1700.446s">As</a>  an aside to that, we have asked for, on numerous occasions, I report back from the administration <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1707.293s">on</a>  waste management's cost analysis with the city as it relates to not only the trash refuse, but also to the recycling. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1716.956s">And</a>  we have never gotten that. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1718.857s">And</a>  like we did last year, unfortunately, at the end of the year, we were hit with an expensive bill of $159,000 to offset supposedly the net of not having enough refuse, not enough recycling to meet the contract of its needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1733.941s">So</a>  again, this is the fourth, maybe fifth time <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1736.536s">We're</a>  asking for that breakdown, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1739.677s">I</a>  believe the way we used to get it before was broken down over the 10-year length of the contract, what was anticipated, what had been spent from prior years as compared to the one coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1751.08s">So</a>  I think that would be helpful to the resolution that's before us.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1757.361s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, did you get that? <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1758.541s">Did</a>  he add that up? <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1760.702s">Councilor</a>  Pender would like you to get a comprehensive report back on waste management. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1766.189s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1766.529s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1767.71s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1769.13s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1770.231s">Council</a>  marks suspension of the rules to take paper 14 dash seven Oh five and 14 dash seven Oh seven.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1780.136s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1784.318s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1787.059s">14</a>  seven Oh five to president Paul Camuso and the members of Medford city council for mayor Michael J. McGlynn easement. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1794.73s">to</a>  Massachusetts Electric Company, 21 James Street, Bedford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1799.211s">Dear</a>  Mr. President, members of the council, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approve the grant of the attached easement to the Massachusetts Electric Company. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1811.474s">The</a>  purpose of this easement is to provide electric service and transmission of data to serve the Department of Public Works facility that is being constructed on James Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1821.076s">I</a>  am attaching a copy of the proposed easement <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1824.201s">to</a>  this request. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1826.061s">Repressively</a>  submitted, Mayor Michael J. McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1830.542s">Move</a>  approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1834.143s">Mr.</a>  Buckley, would you like to say anything?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1840.965s">You're</a>  all set.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1842.445s">Mr.</a>  President, if this matter is moved for approval and we're all in favor of it, I was going to ask for a reconsideration on the previous vote because no vote was taken. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1852.918s">Let's</a>  do this one first. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1857.4s">Councilor</a>  Penta.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1858.92s">Move</a>  approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1860.001s">Move</a>  approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1861.861s">Councilor</a>  Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1863.042s">Just</a>  if we could, we have, uh, the city solicitor here and we also have, uh, Mr. Buckley, uh, here, if they could just give a brief statement on the petition itself.</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1872.385s">Uh,</a>  yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1872.945s">Uh,</a>  Mr. President, my name is Mark Rumley. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1874.926s">I'm</a>  the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1875.746s">I</a>  reside at 50 Woodrow Avenue in Medford first. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1878.467s">I</a>  appreciate being taken under suspension quickly on this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1881.987s">And</a>  one of the reasons I appreciate it is that this easement is a new easement for a power feed into the new city yard. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1889.749s">It's</a>  in a different location than it was before. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1892.469s">The</a>  extension of the power line will be approximately 55 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1896.65s">And</a>  the width of the diameter of the conduit itself is, depending upon where it is, is two to four inches. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1902.851s">But</a>  it will serve the new city yards that are moving along with, I think, all deliberate speed from what I can see. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1909.273s">So</a>  the approval of this easement would <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1911.718s">would</a>  facilitate that even more, and we would ask for your approval.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1918.502s">On</a>  the motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1919.222s">Mr.</a>  President, just if they can give us the length of time that it would take to install this easement.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1929.048s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1930.509s">John</a>  Buckley, 19 Suffolk Street, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1934.091s">Once</a>  they get probably less than 30 days, they've already put the second utility pole in place with the stubs in the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1940.134s">All</a>  they have to do now is bring it across. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1942.356s">So</a>  we just need to go ahead, we'll notify them, and probably within a week it'll be installed, but I'll give them a little flexibility, two to three weeks.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1950.663s">Motion</a>  to approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1951.243s">Motion</a>  to approve.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1952.044s">Councilor</a>  Lange. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1954.046s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1956.267s">Just</a>  electrical, there's no water, what is the entrance?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1960.491s">The</a>  water is already installed by our water department, probably 12 months earlier, so we're in good shape. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1966.256s">This</a>  is to bring, if you're familiar with the back entrance between Grover and Joseph's Limousine, <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1971.054s">That's</a>  where we're bringing the service across. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1972.615s">There</a>  was an existing pole there now. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1974.697s">So</a>  this will only be for the utility, just for the national electric.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1980.502s">Electric.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1980.902s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1981.142s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1982.543s">Councilor</a>  Penta.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1983.484s">Is</a>  this the setup for the permanent pole that's for the permanent use? <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1986.526s">That's</a>  a permanent pole. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1987.527s">This</a>  will be the permanent pole. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1988.548s">That'll</a>  be the permanent pole. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1989.449s">Then</a>  it'll go under the ground and it'll go into the pad. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1991.43s">That'll</a>  actually service the entire facility.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1994.233s">So</a>  right now you're just operating off the temporary. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1996.234s">And</a>  once this goes in, it'll be.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1997.255s">Yeah,</a>  there was already a pole there. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=1998.837s">So</a>  this'll be the new pole that's more robust and all that. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2001.418s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2003.258s">Move</a>  approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2004.039s">Motion</a>  for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2004.859s">All</a>  in favor?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2005.939s">Aye.</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2007.12s">Mr.</a>  Buckley, why here? <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2007.84s">Would</a>  you like to give us a little update on the city yard? <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2009.741s">The</a>  sides are all up and progressing.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2012.642s">As</a>  you can see by driving down the parkway, we're all very excited. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2015.963s">We</a>  have an excellent contractor. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2017.223s">We</a>  have an excellent architect and this job really is, is moving along with great speed. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2021.424s">Uh,</a>  the superstructure is going up as you speak and as you can see it, the outline of the building is there. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2026.92s">So</a>  we're all very encouraged. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2028.881s">We</a>  should be in there April the 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2031.141s">There</a>  was a lot of work involved with that yard because of the old site conditions, getting rid of soil that had to be remediated, those kind of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2039.584s">So</a>  there was a lot of preparation work just to get to the point that we're on now. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2043.806s">So</a>  like I say, it's been a great effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2046.907s">Everybody's</a>  been very cooperative. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2048.127s">I'd</a>  like to thank Joseph's Limousine and Grava. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2050.788s">They've</a>  been outstanding to work with because they're directly impacted by all <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2055.148s">So</a>  we tried to keep them in contact with everything we're doing, but they couldn't have been better. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2059.249s">And</a>  the people right around the corner have been very easy to work with. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2063.01s">So</a>  that makes the job go that much better when you don't have to worry all the time about kind of nagging kind of issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2069.631s">So</a>  also, it's been a great contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2071.972s">The</a>  GNR is probably one of the best contractors I've worked with. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2075.213s">They're</a>  very diligent. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2076.233s">They</a>  follow protocols. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2077.893s">They</a>  make sure all the OSHA certifications are there. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2080.534s">They're</a>  really aren't any surprises. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2082.374s">They</a>  bring everything forthright if it's an unknown condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2085.281s">We</a>  bring things to them that we'd like to consider. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2087.422s">So</a>  it's been a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2089.183s">And</a>  as you can see, one of the first moves we made was to move the new fuel island down the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2094.686s">So</a>  the above-ground tanks was the first order of business. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2097.688s">So</a>  now all the municipal safety and public vehicles can get down to that fuel island, fuel up, and go out without actually going into the construction site. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2106.413s">And</a>  when we're all done, that area will be maintained as the fuel island. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2111.195s">We'll</a>  have access gates, and we'll be able to control who goes in, who goes out. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2114.722s">There'll</a>  also be a public area for the citizens to come down to drop off recycling, plastic bottles, those kind of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2121.088s">So</a>  that'll be segregated from the DPW site and allow the DPW site to kind of be a full municipal operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2128.054s">And</a>  I think every member of the council who voted for this will be very pleased when you see the size of the facility and the fact that you can handle the smallest from the largest piece of equipment and vehicle that the city has. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2139.123s">And</a>  we did that. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2139.704s">We</a>  took the biggest piece of equipment that we have, engine one, <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2142.805s">brought</a>  it down there to make sure everything fit for maintenance, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2146.226s">So</a>  it'll have all the state-of-the-art facilities, energy-efficient, pre-engineered building. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2151.028s">It's</a>  got all of the stormwater management runoff capabilities, retrieving the water that you recycle through and dispose of it properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2157.51s">So</a>  it's been a great project. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2159.55s">I'm</a>  looking very much forward to finally give the DPW people who go to work every day, and they used to work in tough conditions like I know you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2167.953s">So</a>  to give them a first-class facility and the people of Medford <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2171.285s">some</a>  place they can actually go to and respond to and have an emergency operations when you need it for all vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2177.05s">So</a>  I'm very happy.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2178.711s">Any</a>  time paid for a completion?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2181.093s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2181.454s">Looking</a>  at full completion occupancy, April the 1st, April the 1st before completion occupancy. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2187.499s">We'll</a>  have in all projects, you always have substantial completion. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2190.441s">Then</a>  you have a punch list, but the rate we're going right now, if the weather holds for us, we don't have any kind of mother nature things hit us. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2197.207s">I</a>  think we'll be in great shape. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2199.032s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2200.193s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

Abruzzi, 92 High Street Method Mass to address the city council about mailing for the October 28th <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2290.021s">2014</a>  hearing for Coles extended hours.</p>

    <p>[4FrRjkCyMqA_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2299.983s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President, members of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2301.863s">I'm</a>  here in connection with a previously filed petition for a special permit for extended hours of operation, which is to be heard by this council on October 28th, a petition on behalf of Coles. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2315.79s">And</a>  the issue concerns what I'm looking for is the council's approval that the mailing of notice of that hearing be sent by regular mail, which is what the state statute requires. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2329.493s">Apparently</a>  in many cases, I know the city council has previously sent mailing by registered mail return received requested, but since that's not required by the ordinance in this particular case, <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2342.461s">Because</a>  of the condominium building next door, there are 286 abutters, which, at a cost of in excess of $6.50 per certified male, would be an unnecessary cost of approximately $2,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2357.97s">So</a>  that's the substance of my request here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2368.196s">Councilwoman,</a>  go ahead.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2369.316s">Who's</a>  requiring you to come before the council to</p>

    <p>[4FrRjkCyMqA_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2372.291s">Well,</a>  I think City Clerk's Office is looking for some clarification, some direction from the Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2379.077s">Do</a>  you know how many? <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2379.697s">As</a>  opposed to City Solicitor, I previously discussed this issue with Council President Camuso and Vice President Caraviello, and they each suggested that I get some confirmation of what I'm telling you today from the City Solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2397.092s">I</a>  believe the City Solicitor did provide <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2400.02s">via</a>  email, a copy of which I have this evening, to each of you about a week ago, confirming what I'm telling you here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2408.224s">And</a>  how many letters total?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2410.505s">How</a>  many letters total would you have to send?</p>

    <p>[4FrRjkCyMqA_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2413.427s">286</a>  on the abundance list. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2414.587s">286</a>  on the abundance list. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2419.25s">As</a>  a practical matter, more people will get the notice if you send it regular mail than certified, because my experience has been that <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2427.692s">have</a>  the certified letters never get picked up at the post office.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2434.475s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2435.935s">Thank</a>  you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2438.316s">I</a>  don't see any reason why we'd hold this one business to a higher standard than what's required under state statute, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2444.539s">I</a>  think that this is something that's a reasonable request that falls in line with what the law is and I might certainly be supporting it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2449.481s">I</a>  think we should move for approval, but I'd like Councilor Marksley to obviously have a chance to talk on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2454.183s">However,</a>  I don't, <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2455.302s">see</a>  any reason why we'd need to hold them to a higher standard or a different standard than that of any other business here in the community.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2459.625s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2461.926s">Councilor</a>  Dela Rosa. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2463.367s">Mr.</a>  President, I am in agreement with Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2466.509s">I</a>  think that we should observe the ordinance and statutes before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2473.113s">This</a>  isn't something of a grave matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2475.574s">And</a>  oftentimes with collective housing like you have there in the condo building, there would be a, <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2482.919s">meeting</a>  of the residents and a consensus and single voice often represented by the leadership of their housing council or condo board. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2494.688s">So,</a>  and this isn't something of a grave matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2497.73s">It's</a>  just a occasional extension of hours of operation they'd be seeking to have here.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2511.651s">This</a>  will be setting a precedent going forward, Councilor DelaRosa.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2514.914s">I</a>  think that's what we're going for. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2517.936s">The</a>  normal means of conveyance of information is by first class mail, so I don't know why anything else would be required.</p>

    <p>[4FrRjkCyMqA_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2527.864s">Point</a>  of information, I think in some particular circumstances, such as repair shop licenses, your ordinance says that the notice shall be sent certified mail. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2538.772s">So</a>  that's a different situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2541.908s">Unless</a>  the particular ordinance requires it, I would think that the council ought to be bound by what the state statute is. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2551.774s">So</a>  there is no special requirement with respect to the extended hours special permit ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2559.439s">Accordingly,</a>  I think it ought to go to regular mail.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2561.78s">If</a>  I could, through the chair, and ask the city solicitor to instruct us, are there, in addition to <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2570.177s">of</a>  the requirement for certified mail for repair shops, auto repair shops, and auto body shops. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2578.284s">Are</a>  there other instances requiring in our ordinances certified mail notification?</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2583.988s">The</a>  major one is repair shop license. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2585.99s">I</a>  came across that last week specifically when I discussed this with the city clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2590.994s">As</a>  to special permits, and this extension of ours would be a special permit, the law is set forth in 40A section 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2598.922s">And</a>  it says specifically that notice shall be sent by mail postage prepaid. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2603.803s">So</a>  after speaking with the city solicitor, excuse me, the city clerk who told me that the notice of this sort has been done by certified mail, uh, since the, uh, Paleozoic era, we tried to look for what, uh, um, reference there was a foundation for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2621.387s">So</a>  we looked through the council resolutions over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2623.907s">There</a>  is none. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2625.407s">Uh,</a>  look through the council rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2626.728s">There</a>  is nothing that applies to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2628.905s">And</a>  there's nothing that says anything except for what the statute says, which is regular mail. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2633.669s">Now,</a>  one of the prudent things to do if you're worried about setting a precedent that might come back and be problematic in the future is to refer this to essentially a rules committee or to one of your council business committees so that you can take a look at it with some degree of depth and without having to do so in the quickness of one council meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2654.267s">But</a>  as to the special permit, the extension of hours, <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2657.63s">4810</a>  says regular mail. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2660.031s">Very,</a>  very clearly.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2661.791s">Mr.</a>  President, that being said, then I'd, uh, move approval for this, uh, this instance. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2667.933s">And,</a>  uh, as a, uh, uh, amendment to the, uh, uh, resolution, refer this to the rules committee, convene a meeting, uh, so that we can, uh, clarify this and deal with it, uh, for the future.</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2684.878s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2685.478s">Councilor</a>  Bender. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2688.283s">Councilor</a>  Del Russo, that's absurd. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2689.924s">You're</a>  not going to vote for something tonight and then refer it back and possibly get a different opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2694.387s">All</a>  our common vigil licenses we have voted for in the past, Mr. Clark, have been by regular mail. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2700.35s">They</a>  haven't been by certified mail. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2702.212s">Why</a>  would Coles be any different than any other common vigil license? <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2706.794s">Extended</a>  hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2707.875s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2708.115s">Why</a>  would that be it?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2708.656s">No,</a>  let the clerk speak.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2718.276s">The</a>  clerk, the clerk.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2720.797s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2728.961s">So</a>  it's not just for, that we've doing it for extended hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2733.823s">We've</a>  been doing it this way for any special permit zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2737.925s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2739.446s">And</a>  extended hours for this particular case does fall within the chapter and verse that the city solicitor had indicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2748.295s">Now,</a>  before I came here, this practice was in place on certified mail, on a special permit and zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2762.344s">And</a>  to the best of my knowledge, talking to the staff that is here prior to that, they have done it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2768.687s">Now,</a>  going through some research and the city solicitor also looked at it, that I could not find where <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2777.965s">It</a>  instructed our office to make everything certified mail. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2783.806s">It</a>  could be tucked away in some amendment someplace, but there's no council resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2787.587s">There's</a>  no council rules and regulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2790.848s">So</a>  it came about somewhere at some time years ago, even before I came. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2795.629s">So</a>  the practice, when I came in, is that we continued the practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2801.03s">What</a>  the attorney at Bruzy is saying, and I've dealt with, <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2806.697s">attorney</a>  at Bruzee for the past 15 years, and he himself has been charged with certified mail, would have only been three of butters or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2817.985s">So</a>  the practice going forward, I think, if this was the law of states, I just need some clarification to tell me, to tell our office to follow what the law is saying for all special permits. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2832.195s">Because</a>  I don't know where it came from. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2834.457s">It</a>  was beyond me. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2836.921s">You</a>  know, and it must have been a generated, maybe from the city council at some meeting or whatever like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2842.065s">But,</a>  uh, this is, uh, so for me to go forward, I not only could have to do is treat, uh, Mr. Bruzzi's, uh, client, but I think anybody that falls into the special permit, you know, even if it's one, it should go out, uh, the general mail and be, and be a charged accordingly. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2861.298s">So</a>  it's just not just the calls it's no, cause we did Kelly's, <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2865.314s">I</a>  believe six years ago, and it must have cost them over $2,000, because they had two complexes across the street, you know, and they had drive-thru in, they had extended out, so.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2880.961s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2882.582s">If</a>  I could ask Clerk Finn a question about this, because it seems like an easy vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2887.204s">Okay,</a>  it looks like it would be about $1,800 for coals. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2893.138s">process-wise,</a>  who sends out the certified mails? <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2896.159s">That</a>  would be Coles that sends out the certified mails?</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2898.799s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2900.08s">Our</a>  office would prepare all the certified mail, then charge Coles, or the attorney, the cost of the certified mail. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2914.363s">All</a>  the work would be done in our office. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2916.764s">And</a>  it's a lot of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2918.064s">I</a>  mean, it's a lot of work for general mail, too, quite frankly. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2922.46s">Because</a>  it's not like it's, I want to say, a moneymaker for anybody, because the only person that is getting it is the U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2928.503s">Postal</a>  Service. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2930.144s">We</a>  don't charge more than what the certified mail has. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2933.305s">And</a>  now, if you understand the certified mail, in the last two years, it's probably gone up maybe over $2 per piece in the last couple of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2942.31s">Since</a>  the last time we did a big project, like I said, Kelly's like this, you know.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2946.252s">That</a>  was my question, because it would be a concern of mine if <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2948.943s">Coles</a>  had to do the certified mail or send it out regular mail, just with regards to proving that they did so. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2954.404s">But</a>  if that's the case where the city clerk's office sends out whether it be certified or regular mail.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2960.146s">But</a>  it shouldn't be just, it shouldn't be really, from my end of the case, it shouldn't be just Coles. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2963.346s">It</a>  should be whatever the law has written for all the special partners. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2965.787s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2968.388s">Point</a>  of clarification, Mr. Clark, solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2973.049s">To</a>  the best of your knowledge, is the repair shops the only one by statute <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2979.032s">that</a>  requires certified mail?</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2980.733s">When</a>  I went through the council rules and the ordinances, and I used the search word, certified, it was for repair shops. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2989.958s">That</a>  was it? <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2990.518s">That's</a>  all I could find.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=2993.26s">So</a>  it would seem that whether the practice was right or wrong in the past, if this be the case now, and this is the state statute, and we don't have anything to challenge this, this is what the law is. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3003.585s">It's</a>  clearly what the law is. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3004.866s">By</a>  regular mail. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3006.066s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3006.407s">So</a>  we don't need any meeting, Councilor De La <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3009.339s">to</a>  try to figure this out. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3010.76s">I</a>  think it's quite obvious.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3014.282s">Move</a>  approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3015.763s">Councilor</a>  Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3017.625s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3018.745s">And</a>  I agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3020.426s">I</a>  think the fact that a certified meal is not the letter of the law, that past practice, which has happened according to the city clerk for the last 75 years, kind of goes out the window. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3033.435s">And</a>  we should conform to whatever the current standard is, which is prepaid postage. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3039.587s">And</a>  that's acceptable, I think, from what I'm hearing the city clerk ask is that we direct him to do away with past practice, which was certified, and to follow the letter of the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3052.16s">And</a>  I think, is that correct, what you're looking for, Mr. Clerk? <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3054.883s">And</a>  that would apply to everyone, so we're not going to pick and choose.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3058.133s">who</a>  this is going to apply to.</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3063.775s">Yes,</a>  but that's a separate, that's a separate, excuse me, that's a separate section of the ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3070.736s">And</a>  I think part of the reasoning behind that is because of the use of flammable fluids and other things.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3078.699s">If</a>  I may, thank you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3082.46s">Where</a>  you have the return receipt, <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3084.396s">when</a>  somebody comes into the office, say, somebody says, I didn't get the notice, and you then have the return receipt to say, yes, you did. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3092.522s">I</a>  mean, is there, can we amend this? <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3096.464s">You</a>  can require it, regular mail, but take a picture of each envelope showing, you know, that it went out?</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3104.289s">Well,</a>  we have the, we have the butters list that shows who's been sent out to.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3112.364s">My</a>  only concern would be if somebody comes in saying, I didn't get the notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3118.567s">Well,</a>  now you don't have the return receipt anymore.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3121.248s">I</a>  have notices probably this much out here. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3123.709s">And</a>  the last time we did it, that they didn't go and pick up their certified mail. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3130.752s">You</a>  know what I mean?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3132.652s">But</a>  that's a different issue.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3133.633s">Yeah,</a>  but I mean, it's the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3135.594s">But</a>  they tell me they didn't get it the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3138.055s">I</a>  says, I know. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3138.655s">But</a>  you have the proof. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3140.116s">It</a>  was three attempts. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3141.521s">Here,</a>  you know, I mean, to copy, you're asking us to copy, you know, I don't know what Cole's is, 300, 400 envelopes, I mean.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3151.445s">286,</a>  yeah.</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3152.986s">If</a>  I could make a suggestion, you could use the rules that were used in the civil procedure rules and just have a certificate of service executed by the person that sent it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3161.79s">In</a>  this case, it would be the city clerk's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3164.011s">Or</a>  you could ask that the petitioner sign a document saying that they have provided <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3169.618s">this</a>  list of abutters to the city clerk's office and just use a return of service as opposed to photocopying 300 envelopes.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3180.002s">Certificate</a>  of, yeah, I think we should require.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3181.743s">Well,</a>  you get that anyways from the assessor that he certified these.</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3185.965s">Yeah,</a>  he certifies the list, but a separate certification which says that mail went out to those persons at those addresses, which would only have to be a paragraph.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3195.549s">From</a>  the city clerk's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3196.669s">I</a>  would make that recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3198.09s">Some,</a>  I mean, <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3199.416s">going</a>  quickly, but something to prove that with an affidavit or a certification, that each one on that list was mailed by regular mail, the notice.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3211.726s">The</a>  post office will give you a receipt and stamp it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3214.349s">And</a>  if you're signing up 286 and it's off on the city of Bedford, they'll time it, they'll date it, and they'll stamp it.</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3218.933s">Right,</a>  for the amount of the postage that was paid. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3221.315s">Yes,</a>  they would, with the number of items that are on the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3223.757s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3224.898s">Yeah,</a>  but we don't, we do our mail service here. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3228.289s">I'm</a>  not going to the post office with a stack of calls, you know, mails, you know, clerk certifies everything to be sworn and true.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3241.858s">That's</a>  his job. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3242.719s">So,</a>  and so doing, uh, carrying out the office of his work, he can, he can do that.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3247.722s">I</a>  think</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3252.477s">Mr.</a>  President, we're dealing with two separate issues here. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3254.819s">We're</a>  dealing with the matter that's before us, which it appears that, you know, Coles does have the right to just mail these out pre-postage. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3262.907s">Anything</a>  else that we want to do that might well fall under the suggestion that Councilor Dello Russo had going forward.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3270.696s">that</a>  this is not just for calls specifically, but going forward, this is going to be the procedure.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3276.198s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3276.378s">So</a>  going forward, maybe we should consider Councilor De La Ruta's suggestion that we can go and we can refer that matter to the Rules Committee and come up with something that we can all live with. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3284.341s">But</a>  as of right now, in this point in time, there is no requirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3287.282s">So</a>  I think that what we should do, Mr. President, would be move for approval on this paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3290.924s">And</a>  then if, in fact, we need to come up with a process or a policy that the Rules Committee can do such and report it back to the Committee of the Whole for further deliberation.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3300.476s">two</a>  other special permits in the bank so I'm ready to go.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3307.461s">Anything</a>  we decide tonight will be the procedure we use going forward.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3311.683s">Right,</a>  until we change the procedure.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3313.605s">Or</a>  create a procedure.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3314.605s">There</a>  is no procedure to change. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3316.627s">Right</a>  now there is one.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3318.087s">We're</a>  abiding by the current.</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3320.409s">There</a>  is a procedure and it's set forth in the state statute and the other petitioners, whoever they are, should be treated in the exact same way as this petitioner because that's the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3329.255s">It's</a>  simple.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3329.978s">And</a>  if there are some internal controls that the council feels that those should be made, photocopying of the envelope, so on and so forth, that's all well and good.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3339.284s">All</a>  right, motion for approval on this one. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3341.925s">All</a>  in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3343.546s">Opposed?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3345.528s">None.</a> </p>

    <p>[4FrRjkCyMqA_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3346.628s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3347.329s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3347.669s">6-0,</a>  motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3354.533s">Motion</a>  by Councilor Pentland, we revert back to regular business. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3360.512s">14700</a>  offered by councillor Penta, be it resolved that in the interest of public safety for bicyclists and the driving public, a state law proposal be forwarded to our state legislature regarding such matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3373.384s">A</a>  further explanation to be furnished at the council meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3377.607s">Councilor</a>  Penta.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3381.352s">bicycle</a>  enthusiasts out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3384.033s">We</a>  all know we've seen a great influx of bicyclists in our community, as a matter of fact, in the whole Commonwealth of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3391.716s">And</a>  if anybody read Sunday's newspaper in the Boston Globe, they had printed a story about bike fatalities in the greater Boston suburbs and how they've increased from 2010, 11, and 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3401.5s">Unfortunately,</a>  some people died. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3410.548s">And</a>  apparently, that's unfortunate. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3413.15s">It's</a>  an issue right now, I think, that needs to be dealt with as it relates to the public safety portion of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3419.795s">The</a>  popularity of biking is greatly soared. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3423.719s">And</a>  state policy, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3425.42s">Department</a>  of Transportation, and local communities, like Somerville, who's basically one of the communities, like Boston, that's in the forefront of having bicycle-friendly roadways <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3438.79s">and</a>  amenities that would be complementary to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3442.453s">But</a>  the concern, as it relates to where we're going with all these bicycle and bicycle paths in communities such as Medford, which has a bicycle commission, just how much of an input, and more importantly, how much of a control do we have? <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3461.786s">Out</a>  of the 557 schools in the Commonwealth <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3468.129s">signed</a>  up on the state DOT program. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3471.331s">Only</a>  17 of them are actually implementing bicycle safety programs that at least meet the minimal standards that Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3479.514s">Department</a>  of Transportation is asking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3482.236s">The</a>  confusion that's taking place on the roadway, especially for people who are driving cars as compared to when they look at a cyclist, is that, you know, who in fact has the right of way? <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3496.662s">Who's</a>  got the rules of the road? <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3498.343s">who's</a>  supposed to follow what, when, and how. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3501.245s">And</a>  the educational process, once again, really should fall on local communities, because if local communities are going to start with having bicycle-friendly streets and providing certain roadways or pathways or whatever the terminology might be that you would want to have for bicyclists, an educational process needs to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3526.245s">And</a>  if it doesn't take place, <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3528.297s">There's</a>  a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3528.918s">There's</a>  a concern to the bicyclist, the person driving the bike, riding the bike, and the person driving the car. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3534.703s">And</a>  because of that, you know, this prompted me to turn around and think about, you know, it's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3540.587s">It's</a>  a great form of exercise medically. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3542.809s">We</a>  all know that riding a bike is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3545.972s">But</a>  we also know that there's a concern that's predicating some of these safety issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3552.597s">And</a>  one of the concerns seems to be the speed of some of the <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3556.203s">cyclist</a>  when they're riding their bikes. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3558.584s">And</a>  the other one, going through stop signs and driving through crosswalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3564.068s">And</a>  they seem to be the three major concerns of the cities and towns that I reviewed in the Mass State Department of Transportation's concerns, since they've now started to inventory bicycle accidents. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3578.516s">But</a>  Boston thus far has yet to do an inventory of bicycle accidents. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3584.841s">Bicycles,</a>  again, according to Section 11B of Chapter 85, bicycles shall be subject to the traffic laws and regulations of the Commonwealth and special regulations as found in the particular section. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3600.408s">And</a>  the section that I want to get into is the bike in and of itself in hours after dark, before dusk and after dark. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3609.392s">The</a>  operator, this is what the law says, that the operator shall display <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3613.16s">To</a>  the front of the bicycle, a lamp emitting a white light visible from a distance of at least 500 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3620.562s">In</a>  the rear of the bicycle, a light emanating — a red light emanating for not less than 600 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3626.523s">Now,</a>  if you can imagine what it's like driving a car at nighttime and looking out 600 feet and looking at a little dinky red light, good luck to you, because a lot of the times they don't exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3638.966s">And</a>  a lot of the folks that are driving these bikes don't even have these lights on. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3643.485s">So</a>  now we get into initial call enforcement, and where the police department, another part of their job, but bikes are having their way on the roadways, and rightfully so. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3654.35s">And</a>  they deserve to be protected just as much as the person driving the car. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3658.031s">And</a>  they also talk about having on the ankles some type of reflective material. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3663.654s">And</a>  once I saw this thing about the reflective material, that's the thing that got to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3668.436s">I</a>  would like to propose, and hopefully my colleagues will be supportive, and also <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3673.634s">I</a>  had a conversation with Bruce Kulick, who happens to be the chairman of the Bicycle Commission, and I think we're on the same page on this one, that the drivers of a bicycle at nighttime wear some type of a jacket or whatever it might be of a reflective type of material. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3691.105s">How</a>  many times have you driven down the street at nighttime and you see someone with dark clothes on in a crosswalk and you might miss them? <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3697.709s">How</a>  many times do you see a bike driving down the street at dusk and even late at night <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3702.665s">and</a>  have absolutely nothing on that would identify them as a person on a bike by way of color, reflection, or what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3710.85s">There</a>  is no state law out there right now that makes it a mandatory requirement for the purposes of a male or female driving a bicycle having a reflector jacket type of garment on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3728.278s">This</a>  is going to be taking up the same type of fuel. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3731.76s">It's</a>  going to be building up momentum, because as we know, the law that's out there, trying to be out there, that you can't text and drive at the same time, because we know the consequences that can happen by way of accidents. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3744.827s">Well,</a>  the same thing is going to be happening with these bicyclists, because we know that they're becoming more and more of them out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3751.491s">Each</a>  and every community, including Medford, have more and more bicyclists. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3755.313s">And</a>  bicycle folks are going to drive <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3757.07s">whether</a>  they come from Medford or out of town or what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3759.791s">But</a>  there has to be some mode of protection and identification that is protective to these folks that are driving a bike. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3769.914s">And</a>  again, there is nothing in the state law that really goes out of its way that basically says, other than some little, and I'll call it stupid thing you put on your ankle, that who the hell is going to see a reflector thing 600 feet away, as compared to maybe having a reflector type jacket. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3787.763s">that</a>  identifies itself, green, yellow, orange, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3791.506s">It</a>  may not be the most social-looking piece of garment you'd want to wear, but if it's going to protect and save your life, you know, it does the thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3802.976s">So,</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, and I don't know if there's anybody here from the Bicycle Commission who would like to speak on it or what have you, but I would appreciate not only their comments, but more importantly, their support for this because <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3817.659s">Again,</a>  reviewing the accidents as they have been presented and looking at the statistics, and I believe the statistics are going up, they're not going down, on bicycle accidents and, unfortunately, people dying from bicycle accidents, and I believe every single one of them have not been identified with anything at nighttime that would be reflective type of material that would present a safety condition for the person riding the bike.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3844.632s">Sure,</a>  my name is Tim McGivern, 623 Watervale Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3847.134s">I'm</a>  on the Medford Bicycle Advisory Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3850.356s">I</a>  think, are you proposing that Medford have some sort of ordinance that requires reflective vests for bicycles? <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3861.045s">Or</a>  are you proposing that the city council recommend legislature to the state legislature?</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3875.502s">I</a>  am proposing the same way the state legislature has these amendments that have been forthcoming and the law has amended that we again amend the law that makes a requirement statewide for any person riding a bicycle from dawn to dusk that they have to wear some type of reflective type of material easily identifiable by a headlight and an oncoming car or a car behind you or whatever.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3897.577s">I</a>  think that anything to increase the safety of cyclists on the road is a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3902.24s">And</a>  I think wearing a vest that's reflective when you're riding your bicycle is increasing your safety on the road, and therefore it's a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3909.121s">So</a>  I do not oppose such a movement, but I do not speak for the entire bicycle commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3914.002s">We</a>  would need to deliberate on that.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3915.723s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3922.024s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3924.324s">Councilor</a>  Penser, I think you mentioned the Mass General Law. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3929.337s">which</a>  I read as that's already a requirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3936.162s">One</a>  half hour after sunset to one half hour before sunrise, the operator shall display on each pedal of his bicycle a reflector.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3945.268s">I'm</a>  not talking about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3946.369s">I'm</a>  talking about wearing a jacket, something that could be seen and highly visible. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3950.632s">If</a>  you ever get behind a car 600 feet, <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3952.992s">and</a>  try to find that little reflector on the pedal, or on their foot, or the little red light behind a bike that 90% of the time doesn't work, and they run by battery. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3962.214s">Or</a>  you see a little white headlight that's 500 feet away on a bike that doesn't cut the mustard when a car is driving down the street, or even if a truck is driving down the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3970.876s">I</a>  mean, it's, it's.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3974.997s">So</a>  you're proposing that the state legislate it.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3978.957s">Amend</a>  it.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3979.778s">Amend</a>  it, so instead of just the lamp, <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3982.712s">which</a>  is required on the front of the bike or the pedal on the reflector be increased to a vest.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3988.537s">To</a>  a vest. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3989.457s">Or</a>  a garment type of material, vest, jacket, or what have you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3993.44s">What</a>  if we send this to the Bicycle Commission as well, or prior to, to have them discuss? <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=3999.184s">I</a>  mean, there are two members here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4001.766s">I've</a>  spoken to Bruce as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4003.667s">How</a>  many people are on the committee as of right now? <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4008.973s">10</a>  people from Medford on the committee who probably speak to a number of other cyclists. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4013.854s">Let's</a>  get some input.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4015.215s">I</a>  agree with it.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4018.375s">Let's</a>  refer to the Bicycle Commission first. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4020.396s">That</a>  would be my suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4021.716s">I</a>  think it's a great resolve, and I think anything to enhance safety for bicyclists is a positive step. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4028.538s">I</a>  agree with Councilor Penter as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4030.098s">Enforcement</a>  is going to be a big thing, not only for vehicles, but also to put on these vests.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4036.574s">I</a>  think there are some details that need to be worked out as far as what this vest or coat looks like, what it is, and do you have to wear it if you are, say, riding down the sidewalk in a type of neighborhood in Massachusetts that seems silly to wear that vest, like a pedestrian, for example, crossing the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4060.757s">So</a>  I think there are things. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4061.948s">that</a>  can be discussed by the bicycle commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4065.61s">And</a>  I would like to ask that the city council table this until we had a chance to discuss it and make a recommendation to the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4075.095s">A</a>  point of clarification.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4078.017s">This</a>  is directed toward people who drive a bike. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4082.599s">And</a>  I believe the cyclists that drive a bike have to wear a helmet. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4085.901s">Isn't</a>  that required by law too?</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4087.562s">I</a>  believe so.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4088.182s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4090.126s">If</a>  somebody decides from dawn to dusk they want to drive a bike on a sidewalk or a street, the requirement's going to be the same because you're riding a bike. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4099.012s">And</a>  according to Chapter 85, Section, I think it's 10 and 11, there are certain requirements that you have to follow the same rules of the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4106.818s">And</a>  the only exception to the rules of the road, I believe, if you're going, exiting, or entering on a highway and anything else that might be specifically excluded by state statute. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4116.1s">So</a>  I think we're all on the same page. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4117.701s">I</a>  think so too. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4118.441s">And</a>  the more, I think the more support we get for it, you know, and explaining it, I think it, you know, it bears fruit. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4124.244s">This</a>  isn't like wearing a heavy jacket and the winter time. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4126.865s">It's</a>  just, you know, it's something.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4128.306s">I</a>  know exactly what you mean. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4129.387s">I've</a>  seen it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4129.867s">I</a>  wear one myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4131.267s">What</a>  I'm asking for is just the opportunity for the commission to discuss it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4134.989s">And</a>  we could even formalize a recommendation to the city council, but not all.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4140.012s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4141.112s">Thank</a>  you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4143.407s">I</a>  agree with Mr. Givern wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4145.188s">I</a>  think that the Bicycle Commission meets rather frequently. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4147.669s">They</a>  have a large board of people that are probably much more avid cyclists than anybody behind this rail. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4154.971s">They</a>  know the dangers that they face. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4156.692s">They</a>  know what the city needs to do to make them safer, because they're out there every day on these roads, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4161.874s">So</a>  I think it would make sense if we got an advisory opinion from the Bicycle Commission to see what direction that they'd like to see us go. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4170.68s">a</a>  number of issues aside from public safety and how to make Medford more bicycle-friendly. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4175.023s">And</a>  I think that maybe if we look at this in a more comprehensive fashion, if we're going to send something to the legislature, that would be worth its weight.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4183.768s">Would</a>  you like to see us refer it to the Public Safety Committee?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4186.69s">I'd</a>  like to table the matter and have it be sent to the Bicycle Commission for recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4191.213s">Then</a>  we can bring it back to the floor for discussion.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4194.735s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4196.156s">I'd</a>  also recommend that the Bicycle Commission, since it never has, <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4201.22s">take</a>  the opportunity to meet with us and committee of the whole to just present to the council what they're doing, they're discussing and their role in the city so that we can be apprised of that as a body. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4217.506s">So</a>  would you prefer to retable this or?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4219.047s">I'm</a>  referring to the bicycle.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4222.128s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4222.228s">We</a>  send it back to them and then have the president convene a meeting in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4226.15s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4226.49s">So</a>  if you gentlemen can take this back to Mr. Kulik.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4231.507s">We</a>  agree and we'd love the opportunity to do that and so we'll look forward to it.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4234.708s">Does</a>  anyone else want to speak in this matter? <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4237.309s">Gene,</a>  did you want to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4240.109s">The</a>  motion is that we send this back to the bicycle committee for their review and they will get back to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4246.311s">Councilor</a>  Penta.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4247.851s">One</a>  quick thing, and I brought up an issue, there's 557 schools at the present time that are supposed to be, that are allegedly participants in the Department of Transportation public safety program for schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4260.448s">And</a>  only 17 of these communities have jumped on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4264.632s">Is</a>  Method one of the 17 or not? <a href="https://youtu.be/SzZSQAzqgnA&t=4267.094s">Are</a>  you aware of?</p>
