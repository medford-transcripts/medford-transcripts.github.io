57
00:05:03,705 --> 00:05:05,166

58
00:05:05,627 --> 00:05:08,849

59
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:20,098

60
00:05:20,118 --> 00:05:21,138
[SPEAKER_14]: But I owe it to my school.

61
00:05:21,198 --> 00:05:22,019

67
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:45,894
[SPEAKER_13]: While we have Anthony here, I just want to first say I've known the Petrello's family for a very long time.

68
00:08:47,941 --> 00:08:51,343
[SPEAKER_13]: I've seen Anthony Petrellis at work, and what he does is amazing.

69
00:08:52,724 --> 00:08:58,428
[SPEAKER_13]: Proud to have him as the summer instructor at the Columbus camp, and proud to have him as a teacher.

70
00:08:58,868 --> 00:09:04,132
[SPEAKER_13]: And I just want to share this one story, because the city's abuzz about Anthony Petrellis the last week.

71
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:09,035
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe it came from my mother, who speaks very highly of Anthony.

72
00:09:09,796 --> 00:09:17,381
[SPEAKER_13]: And she said that once you won the award, you must have been in the large auditorium with a bunch of teachers and students.

73
00:09:18,025 --> 00:09:25,306
[SPEAKER_13]: And somebody came up to, you know, maybe to Diane or the principal, or I'm not sure who it was, and said, where's this Anthony Petrellis?

74
00:09:25,386 --> 00:09:26,667
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't see him anywhere.

75
00:09:27,407 --> 00:09:34,268
[SPEAKER_13]: And somebody said, well, there he is down on the floor with the kids, like, actively participating and, you know, helping them learn.

76
00:09:35,068 --> 00:09:36,948
[SPEAKER_13]: And I just thought that was an amazing story.

77
00:09:37,048 --> 00:09:40,269
[SPEAKER_13]: So it just shows, you know, what type of teacher he is.

78
00:09:40,309 --> 00:09:42,229
[SPEAKER_13]: He goes above and beyond the call of duty.

79
00:09:42,269 --> 00:09:46,210
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's obvious from the award that was won, which I believe was only

80
00:09:47,151 --> 00:09:55,416
[SPEAKER_13]: one of 25 in the nation, so I just personally want to congratulate Anthony and his family, and all the teachers and principal at the McGlynn.

81
00:09:55,917 --> 00:10:02,021
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

82
00:10:02,261 --> 00:10:02,701
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

83
00:10:02,721 --> 00:10:16,030
[SPEAKER_03]: 14706, offered by Vice President Caraviello, be it resolved that the Medford City Council present a citation to commend and congratulate Bruno Bonacorsi on his recent achievement award for his 32 years of employment with Project Triangle.

[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Caravelle, thank you.

85
00:10:20,414 --> 00:10:35,240
[SPEAKER_03]: For those who don't know, October is National Disability Employment and Awareness Month, which is a national campaign to raise awareness about disability issues and celebrate the many and varied contributions of America's workers with disability.

86
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:40,162
[SPEAKER_03]: This year's theme is Expect, Employ, and Empower.

87
00:10:40,362 --> 00:10:45,984
[SPEAKER_03]: In 1945, Congress enacted a law declaring the first week in October each year to be the National

88
00:10:46,508 --> 00:10:48,349
[SPEAKER_03]: Employee to Physically Handicapped Week.

89
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:58,296
[SPEAKER_03]: However, in 1962, the word physically was removed to acknowledge the employment needs and contributions of individuals with all types of disability.

90
00:10:59,196 --> 00:11:07,662
[SPEAKER_03]: In 1988, CARMS expanded the week to a month and changed the name to National Disability Employment Awareness Month.

91
00:11:08,722 --> 00:11:14,526
[SPEAKER_03]: This evening, we would like to recognize, commend and congratulate Bruno Bonacorsi

92
00:11:15,155 --> 00:11:19,557
[SPEAKER_03]: on his recent achievement award for 32 years of employment with Triangle in Baltimore.

93
00:11:20,317 --> 00:11:29,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Triangle was founded in 1971 by individuals who believed that people with disabilities could learn and lead more independent and dignified lives.

94
00:11:30,282 --> 00:11:39,766
[SPEAKER_03]: It began serving five people with developmental needs and grew over the next decade to an employment training program for over 80 individuals.

95
00:11:40,446 --> 00:11:42,928
[SPEAKER_03]: Today, Triangle serves over 3,000 people in our area.

96
00:11:48,376 --> 00:11:54,381
[SPEAKER_03]: Bruno, who is now 58 years old, and his family are lifelong residents of Medford.

97
00:11:54,981 --> 00:12:02,047
[SPEAKER_03]: There aren't many in Medford who don't know Bruno, either from being on the sidelines of Mustang football games, baseball fields, St.

98
00:12:02,067 --> 00:12:07,952
[SPEAKER_03]: Clement Church on Saturday, where he presents the gifts to priests, or various city events.

99
00:12:09,313 --> 00:12:16,058
[SPEAKER_03]: After leaving Lincoln Junior High School, Bruno started his working career at the Hagner Center in Medford, and then moved on to

100
00:12:16,563 --> 00:12:19,725
[SPEAKER_03]: Triangle center upon the Hegner center's closing.

101
00:12:20,585 --> 00:12:23,907
[SPEAKER_03]: Bruno is the model of what Triangle teaches.

102
00:12:24,487 --> 00:12:25,828
[SPEAKER_03]: He never misses a day of work.

103
00:12:26,869 --> 00:12:29,510
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is truly part of his daily routine.

104
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:40,516
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone driving by 226 Main Street at 7 o'clock in the morning will see this young man standing at the door with his lunch bag in his hand waiting for the van to pick him up to go to work.

105
00:12:41,077 --> 00:12:43,078
[SPEAKER_03]: And God forbid the van is late.

106
00:12:44,058 --> 00:12:45,059
[SPEAKER_03]: His job is his life.

107
00:12:46,445 --> 00:12:51,187
[SPEAKER_03]: Every week, he probably brings home his paycheck and gives it to his mother.

108
00:12:51,227 --> 00:12:56,970
[SPEAKER_03]: Bruno doesn't make much money, but he has learned to become a proud and productive member of our society.

109
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:00,211
[SPEAKER_03]: He would work seven days a week if possible.

110
00:13:00,531 --> 00:13:03,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone in this country should have his work ethic.

111
00:13:03,853 --> 00:13:13,937
[SPEAKER_03]: No one can really understand the obstacles that the families of people with disabilities like Bruno go through every day unless they are part of your family like Bruno was part of mine.

112
00:13:15,483 --> 00:13:20,608
[SPEAKER_03]: is the exact meaning of what National Disability Employment Awareness Month is all about.

113
00:13:21,349 --> 00:13:35,342
[SPEAKER_03]: If I could ask Bruno and his mother to come up here.

114
00:14:04,658 --> 00:14:15,317
[SPEAKER_03]: The Medford City Council takes pleasure in awarding this council accommodation to Bruno Bonacorsi in recognition of Bruno's recent achievement award for his 32 years of employment with Project Triangle.

115
00:14:17,581 --> 00:14:17,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

116
00:14:37,099 --> 00:14:38,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that better than the one the other one gave you?

117
00:15:15,388 --> 00:15:23,611
You're going to say salami?

118
00:15:45,646 --> 00:15:46,526
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Bruno.

119
00:16:29,835 --> 00:16:30,995
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all on the calendar.

120
00:16:31,016 --> 00:16:32,436
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to bring that up, you can.

121
00:16:35,197 --> 00:16:35,337
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

122
00:16:35,357 --> 00:16:38,358
[SPEAKER_13]: Nicole, right?

123
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:39,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

124
00:16:40,619 --> 00:16:43,620
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not sure of his name.

125
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,620
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't stop.

126
00:16:45,061 --> 00:16:45,681
[SPEAKER_13]: Nicole and Steve.

127
00:16:46,361 --> 00:16:46,901
[SPEAKER_13]: Nicole and Steve.

128
00:16:47,561 --> 00:16:47,802
[SPEAKER_13]: Steve.

129
00:16:49,202 --> 00:16:57,385
[SPEAKER_13]: Just while we have Councilor Caraviello's daughter in the audience, she's just recently engaged, so we want to congratulate her, Nicole and Steve.

130
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:05,730
[SPEAKER_13]: Good luck with the wedding planning and hope you, yeah, many years together.

131
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:17,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we getting that $21,000 raise like Boston guys?

132
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:18,701
[SPEAKER_03]: 14-698 offered by Councilor Penta.

133
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:24,786
[SPEAKER_03]: Be it resolved that the council commendation be sent to Frederick Lasky, executive director of the MWIRA.

[SPEAKER_03]: for receiving the Norman B. Leventhal Excellence in City Building Award.

135
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:36,942
[SPEAKER_03]: Fred was honored with the Environmental Award recipient for his water protection leadership at the MWRA.

136
00:17:37,602 --> 00:17:45,725
[SPEAKER_03]: This award also acknowledges Fred's dedication toward our region's environment while providing clean drinking water to communities throughout eastern Massachusetts.

137
00:17:47,545 --> 00:17:48,226
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Pentec.

138
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:54,228
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, this is very unusual to have at a Medford City Council meeting, three acknowledgments in a row.

139
00:17:54,248 --> 00:17:55,348
[SPEAKER_20]: This is like a triple play.

140
00:17:55,832 --> 00:17:56,893
[SPEAKER_20]: This is all good news.

141
00:17:57,573 --> 00:18:04,439
[SPEAKER_20]: And what's going on in the world, in the city, in the town, in the states today, it's nice to have recognition for folks who really deserve it.

142
00:18:05,019 --> 00:18:05,800
[SPEAKER_20]: We all know Fred.

143
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:11,104
[SPEAKER_20]: If you don't know Fred, former member of our Medford School Committee, family man.

144
00:18:11,444 --> 00:18:16,968
[SPEAKER_20]: But as the executive director of the MWRA, he's the guy, unfortunately, that when you get your water bill, you think it's kind of high.

145
00:18:17,048 --> 00:18:17,789
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not from him.

146
00:18:18,229 --> 00:18:19,750
[SPEAKER_20]: He only sells it to us wholesale.

147
00:18:20,171 --> 00:18:22,032
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's what the city charges after the fact.

148
00:18:23,544 --> 00:18:26,726
[SPEAKER_20]: The award that Fred received is kind of like unique.

149
00:18:26,746 --> 00:18:28,607
[SPEAKER_20]: He received it from a company called ABC.

150
00:18:29,227 --> 00:18:34,811
[SPEAKER_20]: And they're an independent membership-based organization here in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

151
00:18:34,971 --> 00:18:41,175
[SPEAKER_20]: And what they do is they advance significant transportation development and environmental policies.

152
00:18:41,835 --> 00:18:46,858
[SPEAKER_20]: And Fred, for many years, as you know, or if you don't know, has been the executive director of the MWRA.

153
00:18:47,579 --> 00:18:52,882
[SPEAKER_20]: And by being there, he has brought forward many innovative and environmental-friendly

154
00:18:54,953 --> 00:19:05,501
[SPEAKER_20]: management techniques as well as work techniques that have just really advanced the MWRA to be a very sophisticated, technological, and water-environmental friendly organization.

155
00:19:05,982 --> 00:19:11,546
[SPEAKER_20]: That's basically what the award was that Fred received because of his environmental participation.

156
00:19:12,247 --> 00:19:20,333
[SPEAKER_20]: And as a result of that, and knowing that his wife Donna is in the audience tonight, and once again, a teacher and a supporter of Mr. Petralas,

157
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:22,463
[SPEAKER_20]: It's just a family ongoing thing.

158
00:19:22,723 --> 00:19:26,024
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, their community driven spirit is here in the city of Medford.

159
00:19:26,524 --> 00:19:30,185
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think it's great that we're acknowledging three method individuals tonight.

160
00:19:30,425 --> 00:19:31,785
[SPEAKER_20]: Now it's Fred Lasky's turn.

161
00:19:32,386 --> 00:19:41,708
[SPEAKER_20]: And I would just like to say thank you to Mr. Lasky, uh, for doing the job, um, that a lot of people probably would not want to have, but at the same time being recognized for it.

162
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:45,248
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, because this award, uh, is a very prestigious award.

163
00:19:45,288 --> 00:19:47,489
[SPEAKER_20]: It's only in its fourth year of operation.

164
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,482
[SPEAKER_20]: And Fred is the fourth person to get this environmental award.

165
00:19:51,922 --> 00:19:57,665
[SPEAKER_20]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I'd like to forward the commendation to Mr. Lasky.

166
00:19:57,725 --> 00:20:01,446
[SPEAKER_20]: And if he wishes, he could come before the council at a future date to receive it.

167
00:20:01,506 --> 00:20:06,008
[SPEAKER_20]: But I didn't want any more time to go by without the acknowledgement being recognized.

168
00:20:07,129 --> 00:20:07,949
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Penta.

169
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:10,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Marks.

170
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:12,211
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

171
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:15,653
[SPEAKER_09]: And I want to thank Councilor Penta for offering this resolution.

172
00:20:16,622 --> 00:20:24,984
[SPEAKER_09]: He mentioned that Mr. Lasky has done yeoman's work in regards to green initiatives with the MWRA.

173
00:20:25,745 --> 00:20:44,530
[SPEAKER_09]: And also, Mr. President, a little-known fact that while under the leadership of Mr. Lasky, the Water Authority has grown into an establishment that provides safe drinking water to many thousands of residents of this commonwealth.

174
00:20:45,245 --> 00:21:00,614
[SPEAKER_09]: And in addition to that, Mr. President, another little-known fact is the fact that it costs — and consumers probably wouldn't realize this, but it costs roughly one cent to get a clean gallon of drinking water to your home.

175
00:21:01,534 --> 00:21:09,359
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's through the hard dedication and leadership through Mr. Lasky and the whole MWRA over the years, Mr. President.

176
00:21:09,899 --> 00:21:12,220
[SPEAKER_09]: And I personally want to thank Fred.

177
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,461
[SPEAKER_09]: I've known him for a number of years.

178
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:26,535
[SPEAKER_09]: As Councilor Penta mentioned, he's a great family man, and he really does a service to not only this community, but everyone in the Commonwealth by his leadership at the MWRA, Mr. President.

179
00:21:27,856 --> 00:21:28,697
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

180
00:21:31,218 --> 00:21:31,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone else?

181
00:21:35,361 --> 00:21:36,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, Mr. Clerk, did we get that?

182
00:21:37,202 --> 00:21:37,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

183
00:21:39,263 --> 00:21:42,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Suspension has been asked for by Councilor Layton for a brief announcement.

184
00:21:44,671 --> 00:21:45,131
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight.

185
00:21:45,691 --> 00:21:46,952
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

186
00:21:47,712 --> 00:21:50,473
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to offer the floor to Ms.

187
00:21:50,493 --> 00:21:51,233
[SPEAKER_07]: Kathy Young here.

188
00:21:51,253 --> 00:21:57,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Kathy is a volunteer with our Office of the Environment and Energy, and she'd like to make a brief announcement about this weekend's festival.

189
00:22:01,297 --> 00:22:02,257
[SPEAKER_07]: Name and address of the record, please.

190
00:22:03,513 --> 00:22:05,195
[SPEAKER_00]: Catherine Young, 64 Medford Street.

191
00:22:05,215 --> 00:22:14,625
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank the Council for the opportunity to speak and also for Councilman Knight for the invitation to mention the Harvester Energy Festival.

192
00:22:14,645 --> 00:22:18,288
[SPEAKER_00]: It's happening this Saturday, October 18th from 11 a.m.

193
00:22:19,009 --> 00:22:19,570
[SPEAKER_00]: to 2 p.m.

194
00:22:20,371 --> 00:22:25,116
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd also like to thank Alicia Hunt for her significant amount of work to make that happen.

195
00:22:25,836 --> 00:22:29,659
[SPEAKER_00]: The Energy Committee supports that, but she put a lot of work into that, so I want to recognize that also.

196
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,261
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the fifth annual Harvester Energy Festival.

197
00:22:33,582 --> 00:22:37,865
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be held at Riverbend Park behind the McGlynn School from 11 a.m.

198
00:22:37,905 --> 00:22:38,605
[SPEAKER_00]: to 2 p.m.

199
00:22:39,446 --> 00:22:54,637
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the events that will occur, we will be giving out the third annual Green Awards, and those are to Medford area businesses, residents, and organizations that have taken on measures geared toward energy conservation and environmental initiatives.

200
00:22:55,678 --> 00:22:59,060
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be giving out toys for the wind turbine.

201
00:22:59,841 --> 00:23:00,642
[SPEAKER_00]: That will happen.

202
00:23:00,682 --> 00:23:07,408
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll also have some tables, educational and informational tables, for Medford students, clubs, and green businesses.

203
00:23:08,369 --> 00:23:15,815
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have a shredding truck that's returning, so people can bring their boxes of paper, anything that needs to be shredded.

204
00:23:16,075 --> 00:23:21,500
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have volunteers there to help people bring it from their car to the shredder, if that's necessary.

205
00:23:23,221 --> 00:23:32,726
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have a free raffle again this year and prizes will be including compost bin, free dance lessons from Dance Caliante, sausage sandwiches from Fred's Franks.

206
00:23:32,866 --> 00:23:34,387
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll also be there selling food.

207
00:23:36,028 --> 00:23:36,708
[SPEAKER_00]: What else do we have?

208
00:23:36,728 --> 00:23:41,491
[SPEAKER_00]: We have gift basket from Medford Whole Foods and a massage gift certificate from Elements Massage.

209
00:23:42,191 --> 00:23:47,655
[SPEAKER_00]: lots of great prizes to get people's interest and encourage people to attend.

210
00:23:48,615 --> 00:23:54,359
[SPEAKER_00]: The very popular TechniArt will be selling sets of energy-efficient lights and light bulbs again for $10.

211
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:55,139
[SPEAKER_00]: They did that last year.

212
00:23:55,159 --> 00:23:55,940
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very popular.

213
00:23:56,881 --> 00:24:01,383
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been subsidized by National Grid, again, so that will be a popular item.

214
00:24:02,224 --> 00:24:05,326
[SPEAKER_00]: New this year, we're going to have the Be the Match program.

215
00:24:05,426 --> 00:24:06,527
[SPEAKER_00]: It's from Dana Farber.

216
00:24:07,467 --> 00:24:11,410
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will be typing people for bone marrow donation.

217
00:24:12,171 --> 00:24:13,752
[SPEAKER_00]: We thought that would be a good addition to have.

218
00:24:14,232 --> 00:24:19,216
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, they may have their blood mobile there as well, to give people an opportunity to donate blood.

219
00:24:20,256 --> 00:24:23,338
[SPEAKER_00]: Also new will be a bike rodeo, something great for the kids.

220
00:24:23,899 --> 00:24:27,361
[SPEAKER_00]: What this is, is it's from Safe Routes to School, that program.

221
00:24:27,401 --> 00:24:29,543
[SPEAKER_00]: It's children should bring their bikes and their helmets.

222
00:24:30,103 --> 00:24:37,965
[SPEAKER_00]: to learn about safe biking, riding, and the Medford Bike Commission will be there leading micro-tours from the festival site to assembly row and back.

223
00:24:38,665 --> 00:24:41,246
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll be primarily using the shared trails.

224
00:24:41,306 --> 00:24:43,807
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about five miles, a round trip.

225
00:24:43,867 --> 00:24:48,788
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mostly flat, so people of all ages can participate, kids, adults, whatever.

226
00:24:49,668 --> 00:24:52,629
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Bike Commission will also be valet parking your bikes.

227
00:24:52,709 --> 00:24:56,190
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always nice to have valet parking during the course of the festival.

228
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:59,451
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to be a beautiful day, so I hope everyone can make it.

229
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:02,854
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, and we look forward to seeing everyone there this weekend.

230
00:25:03,215 --> 00:25:03,855
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.

231
00:25:07,657 --> 00:25:08,057
[SPEAKER_00]: 11 a.m.

232
00:25:08,237 --> 00:25:08,738
[SPEAKER_00]: to 2 p.m.

233
00:25:08,778 --> 00:25:09,338
[SPEAKER_00]: on Saturday.

234
00:25:09,358 --> 00:25:15,962
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, Richard Cormier, 150 Middlesex Ave.

235
00:25:16,422 --> 00:25:19,304
[SPEAKER_16]: I just wanted to add to that, she mentioned the Be the Match program.

236
00:25:20,244 --> 00:25:21,825
[SPEAKER_16]: Many of you might know my father, Rich Cormier.

237
00:25:22,446 --> 00:25:26,088
[SPEAKER_16]: He was diagnosed with a blood disease, and he had to go through a stem cell transplant.

238
00:25:26,748 --> 00:25:30,130
[SPEAKER_16]: And it was through the Be the Match program that it's a very simple program.

239
00:25:30,543 --> 00:25:34,425
[SPEAKER_16]: You just go down there, you fill out some paperwork, and they swab the inside of your cheek, and that's it.

240
00:25:35,105 --> 00:25:40,648
[SPEAKER_16]: Then you get put into a database, and then anywhere around the world they can end up contacting you.

241
00:25:41,508 --> 00:25:44,330
[SPEAKER_16]: And it used to be a difficult process.

242
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:46,030
[SPEAKER_16]: Now it's a very simple process.

243
00:25:46,091 --> 00:25:48,872
[SPEAKER_16]: It's more just like a blood transfusion, just like when you donate any type of blood.

244
00:25:49,372 --> 00:25:56,295
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's very simple when you are called upon to donate stem cells, which the chances are very rare that you get called upon.

245
00:25:56,355 --> 00:25:59,057
[SPEAKER_16]: But it's a very simple process.

246
00:26:00,698 --> 00:26:03,279
[SPEAKER_16]: I was looking forward to people going out there and signing up.

247
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,560
[SPEAKER_16]: And my father's doing great, by the way.

248
00:26:06,421 --> 00:26:06,541
[SPEAKER_16]: So.

249
00:26:06,561 --> 00:26:07,721
[SPEAKER_03]: So your father every Sunday is good?

250
00:26:07,921 --> 00:26:08,061
[SPEAKER_16]: Yep.

251
00:26:08,081 --> 00:26:08,402
[SPEAKER_16]: Doing well.

252
00:26:08,462 --> 00:26:11,183
[SPEAKER_16]: And he's actually, he's teaching right now through Skype.

253
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:14,104
[SPEAKER_16]: He's teaching some of the kids of the Vogue through Skype.

254
00:26:14,124 --> 00:26:16,065
[SPEAKER_16]: They have a camera set up in the classroom and at my house.

255
00:26:16,105 --> 00:26:18,967
[SPEAKER_16]: And he's doing some teaching through that, so he can get back hopefully in January.

256
00:26:19,527 --> 00:26:19,847
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

257
00:26:20,487 --> 00:26:20,787
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

258
00:26:20,948 --> 00:26:21,248
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

259
00:26:23,489 --> 00:26:25,049
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion by Councilor Dela Ruzzo.

260
00:26:25,069 --> 00:26:25,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on.

261
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:26,970
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on.

262
00:26:28,651 --> 00:26:28,891
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on.

263
00:26:29,351 --> 00:26:29,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on.

264
00:26:29,632 --> 00:26:29,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on.

265
00:26:32,506 --> 00:26:38,528
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, I just want to echo the comments of the last two speakers regarding the Be the Match program.

266
00:26:39,209 --> 00:26:50,313
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, it's not often that you could make such a donation that is not financial in nature, but it's a donation to actually possibly save someone's life.

267
00:26:51,014 --> 00:26:52,895
[SPEAKER_09]: And I can't think of a better donation to make.

268
00:26:53,555 --> 00:26:57,416
[SPEAKER_09]: And as was just mentioned, it's just the swabbing of the inside of your mouth.

269
00:26:58,217 --> 00:27:00,738
[SPEAKER_09]: And I plan on going down.

270
00:27:01,382 --> 00:27:11,865
[SPEAKER_09]: this weekend, Mr. President, and I would urge residents of this community to go down and not only enjoy the event, but also take part in the Be The Match program, Mr. President.

271
00:27:12,345 --> 00:27:13,205
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

272
00:27:16,666 --> 00:27:19,087
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion by Councilor Dello Russo to revert back to regular business.

273
00:27:19,107 --> 00:27:30,030
[SPEAKER_03]: 14-699, offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that Waste Management perform a comprehensive inspection of the vehicles used for trash

274
00:27:30,783 --> 00:27:33,025
[SPEAKER_03]: and recycling pickup in the city of Medford.

275
00:27:33,085 --> 00:27:33,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight.

276
00:27:34,466 --> 00:27:35,727
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

277
00:27:36,728 --> 00:27:48,939
[SPEAKER_07]: In recent weeks, I've gotten a number of calls relative to what I guess would be labeled trash truck slime leaking out of the trash trucks, causing a little bit of a problem relative to quality of life in certain neighborhoods.

278
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:52,723
[SPEAKER_07]: I've gotten a number of calls from the Lawrence Street neighborhood.

279
00:27:53,183 --> 00:27:56,306
[SPEAKER_07]: It's also happened right in my own backyard, Mr. President, along Winthrop Street.

280
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,140
[SPEAKER_07]: We've seen it on Spring Street as well.

281
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:04,942
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'd ask that Waste Management do an inspection of their vehicles to ensure that they're not leaking any trash and refuse and fluid onto our streets.

282
00:28:05,882 --> 00:28:11,463
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it may pose a significant public health hazard, but more or less it's really just a quality of life issue.

283
00:28:11,483 --> 00:28:17,145
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, we'll move forward something on, we'll have the clerk move something on to Waste Management.

284
00:28:19,305 --> 00:28:20,326
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Penta.

285
00:28:20,446 --> 00:28:26,567
[SPEAKER_20]: As an aside to that, we have asked for, on numerous occasions, I report back from the administration

286
00:28:27,293 --> 00:28:36,376
[SPEAKER_20]: on waste management's cost analysis with the city as it relates to not only the trash refuse, but also to the recycling.

287
00:28:36,956 --> 00:28:38,657
[SPEAKER_20]: And we have never gotten that.

288
00:28:38,857 --> 00:28:53,621
[SPEAKER_20]: And like we did last year, unfortunately, at the end of the year, we were hit with an expensive bill of $159,000 to offset supposedly the net of not having enough refuse, not enough recycling to meet the contract of its needs.

289
00:28:53,941 --> 00:28:56,102
[SPEAKER_20]: So again, this is the fourth, maybe fifth time

290
00:28:56,536 --> 00:28:59,397
[SPEAKER_20]: We're asking for that breakdown, Mr. President.

291
00:28:59,677 --> 00:29:10,099
[SPEAKER_20]: I believe the way we used to get it before was broken down over the 10-year length of the contract, what was anticipated, what had been spent from prior years as compared to the one coming in.

292
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:15,681
[SPEAKER_20]: So I think that would be helpful to the resolution that's before us.

293
00:29:17,361 --> 00:29:18,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Clerk, did you get that?

294
00:29:18,541 --> 00:29:19,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Did he add that up?

295
00:29:20,702 --> 00:29:25,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Pender would like you to get a comprehensive report back on waste management.

296
00:29:26,189 --> 00:29:26,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

297
00:29:26,529 --> 00:29:27,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

298
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:28,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

299
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:29,351
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

300
00:29:30,231 --> 00:29:37,474
[SPEAKER_09]: Council marks suspension of the rules to take paper 14 dash seven Oh five and 14 dash seven Oh seven.

301
00:29:40,136 --> 00:29:40,516
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

302
00:29:44,318 --> 00:29:47,039
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

303
00:29:47,059 --> 00:29:53,402
[SPEAKER_03]: 14 seven Oh five to president Paul Camuso and the members of Medford city council for mayor Michael J. McGlynn easement.

304
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:58,451
[SPEAKER_03]: to Massachusetts Electric Company, 21 James Street, Bedford, Mass.

305
00:29:59,211 --> 00:30:10,314
[SPEAKER_03]: Dear Mr. President, members of the council, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approve the grant of the attached easement to the Massachusetts Electric Company.

306
00:30:11,474 --> 00:30:20,996
[SPEAKER_03]: The purpose of this easement is to provide electric service and transmission of data to serve the Department of Public Works facility that is being constructed on James Street.

307
00:30:21,076 --> 00:30:23,097
[SPEAKER_03]: I am attaching a copy of the proposed easement

308
00:30:24,201 --> 00:30:24,861
[SPEAKER_03]: to this request.

309
00:30:26,061 --> 00:30:28,962
[SPEAKER_03]: Repressively submitted, Mayor Michael J. McGlynn.

310
00:30:30,542 --> 00:30:31,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Move approval.

311
00:30:34,143 --> 00:30:40,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Buckley, would you like to say anything?

312
00:30:40,965 --> 00:30:41,925
[SPEAKER_09]: You're all set.

313
00:30:42,445 --> 00:30:51,847
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, if this matter is moved for approval and we're all in favor of it, I was going to ask for a reconsideration on the previous vote because no vote was taken.

314
00:30:52,918 --> 00:30:57,380
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's do this one first.

315
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,100
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Penta.

316
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,440
[SPEAKER_09]: Move approval.

317
00:31:00,001 --> 00:31:00,461
[SPEAKER_09]: Move approval.

318
00:31:01,861 --> 00:31:02,982
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Marks.

319
00:31:03,042 --> 00:31:11,965
[SPEAKER_09]: Just if we could, we have, uh, the city solicitor here and we also have, uh, Mr. Buckley, uh, here, if they could just give a brief statement on the petition itself.

320
00:31:12,385 --> 00:31:12,745
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, yes.

321
00:31:12,945 --> 00:31:14,906
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, Mr. President, my name is Mark Rumley.

322
00:31:14,926 --> 00:31:15,726
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm the city solicitor.

323
00:31:15,746 --> 00:31:18,027
[SPEAKER_10]: I reside at 50 Woodrow Avenue in Medford first.

324
00:31:18,467 --> 00:31:21,368
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate being taken under suspension quickly on this matter.

325
00:31:21,987 --> 00:31:29,208
[SPEAKER_10]: And one of the reasons I appreciate it is that this easement is a new easement for a power feed into the new city yard.

326
00:31:29,749 --> 00:31:31,969
[SPEAKER_10]: It's in a different location than it was before.

327
00:31:32,469 --> 00:31:36,110
[SPEAKER_10]: The extension of the power line will be approximately 55 feet.

328
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:42,371
[SPEAKER_10]: And the width of the diameter of the conduit itself is, depending upon where it is, is two to four inches.

329
00:31:42,851 --> 00:31:48,772
[SPEAKER_10]: But it will serve the new city yards that are moving along with, I think, all deliberate speed from what I can see.

330
00:31:49,273 --> 00:31:50,833
[SPEAKER_10]: So the approval of this easement would

331
00:31:51,718 --> 00:31:55,440
[SPEAKER_10]: would facilitate that even more, and we would ask for your approval.

332
00:31:58,502 --> 00:31:58,882
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion?

333
00:31:59,222 --> 00:32:05,506
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, just if they can give us the length of time that it would take to install this easement.

334
00:32:09,048 --> 00:32:10,008
[SPEAKER_19]: Name and address for the record, please.

335
00:32:10,509 --> 00:32:12,690
[SPEAKER_19]: John Buckley, 19 Suffolk Street, Medford, Mass.

336
00:32:14,091 --> 00:32:19,994
[SPEAKER_19]: Once they get probably less than 30 days, they've already put the second utility pole in place with the stubs in the ground.

337
00:32:20,134 --> 00:32:21,515
[SPEAKER_19]: All they have to do now is bring it across.

338
00:32:22,356 --> 00:32:28,601
[SPEAKER_19]: So we just need to go ahead, we'll notify them, and probably within a week it'll be installed, but I'll give them a little flexibility, two to three weeks.

339
00:32:30,663 --> 00:32:31,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to approve.

340
00:32:31,243 --> 00:32:32,004
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to approve.

341
00:32:32,044 --> 00:32:33,725
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Lange.

342
00:32:34,046 --> 00:32:35,827
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

343
00:32:36,267 --> 00:32:40,331
[SPEAKER_13]: Just electrical, there's no water, what is the entrance?

344
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:45,655
[SPEAKER_19]: The water is already installed by our water department, probably 12 months earlier, so we're in good shape.

345
00:32:46,256 --> 00:32:50,299
[SPEAKER_19]: This is to bring, if you're familiar with the back entrance between Grover and Joseph's Limousine,

346
00:32:51,054 --> 00:32:52,595
[SPEAKER_19]: That's where we're bringing the service across.

347
00:32:52,615 --> 00:32:53,956
[SPEAKER_19]: There was an existing pole there now.

348
00:32:54,697 --> 00:32:59,501
[SPEAKER_19]: So this will only be for the utility, just for the national electric.

349
00:33:00,502 --> 00:33:00,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Electric.

350
00:33:00,902 --> 00:33:01,122
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

351
00:33:01,142 --> 00:33:01,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

352
00:33:02,543 --> 00:33:03,044
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Penta.

353
00:33:03,484 --> 00:33:06,286
[SPEAKER_19]: Is this the setup for the permanent pole that's for the permanent use?

354
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:07,327
[SPEAKER_19]: That's a permanent pole.

355
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:08,528
[SPEAKER_19]: This will be the permanent pole.

356
00:33:08,548 --> 00:33:09,429
[SPEAKER_19]: That'll be the permanent pole.

357
00:33:09,449 --> 00:33:11,410
[SPEAKER_19]: Then it'll go under the ground and it'll go into the pad.

358
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:13,272
[SPEAKER_19]: That'll actually service the entire facility.

359
00:33:14,233 --> 00:33:15,874
[SPEAKER_20]: So right now you're just operating off the temporary.

360
00:33:16,234 --> 00:33:17,215
[SPEAKER_20]: And once this goes in, it'll be.

361
00:33:17,255 --> 00:33:18,376
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, there was already a pole there.

362
00:33:18,837 --> 00:33:21,358
[SPEAKER_19]: So this'll be the new pole that's more robust and all that.

363
00:33:21,418 --> 00:33:21,658
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

364
00:33:23,258 --> 00:33:24,019
[SPEAKER_03]: Move approval.

365
00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:24,779
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion for approval.

366
00:33:24,859 --> 00:33:25,279
[SPEAKER_03]: All in favor?

367
00:33:25,939 --> 00:33:27,100
[SPEAKER_19]: Aye.

368
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:27,820
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Buckley, why here?

369
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,721
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you like to give us a little update on the city yard?

370
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:32,001
[SPEAKER_03]: The sides are all up and progressing.

371
00:33:32,642 --> 00:33:35,042
[SPEAKER_19]: As you can see by driving down the parkway, we're all very excited.

372
00:33:35,963 --> 00:33:37,203
[SPEAKER_19]: We have an excellent contractor.

373
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:40,684
[SPEAKER_19]: We have an excellent architect and this job really is, is moving along with great speed.

374
00:33:41,424 --> 00:33:46,146
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, the superstructure is going up as you speak and as you can see it, the outline of the building is there.

375
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,861
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're all very encouraged.

376
00:33:48,881 --> 00:33:50,221
[SPEAKER_19]: We should be in there April the 1st.

377
00:33:51,141 --> 00:33:58,904
[SPEAKER_19]: There was a lot of work involved with that yard because of the old site conditions, getting rid of soil that had to be remediated, those kind of things.

378
00:33:59,584 --> 00:34:03,005
[SPEAKER_19]: So there was a lot of preparation work just to get to the point that we're on now.

379
00:34:03,806 --> 00:34:06,326
[SPEAKER_19]: So like I say, it's been a great effort.

380
00:34:06,907 --> 00:34:08,107
[SPEAKER_19]: Everybody's been very cooperative.

381
00:34:08,127 --> 00:34:10,228
[SPEAKER_19]: I'd like to thank Joseph's Limousine and Grava.

382
00:34:10,788 --> 00:34:14,189
[SPEAKER_19]: They've been outstanding to work with because they're directly impacted by all

383
00:34:15,148 --> 00:34:19,209
[SPEAKER_19]: So we tried to keep them in contact with everything we're doing, but they couldn't have been better.

384
00:34:19,249 --> 00:34:22,950
[SPEAKER_19]: And the people right around the corner have been very easy to work with.

385
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:29,591
[SPEAKER_19]: So that makes the job go that much better when you don't have to worry all the time about kind of nagging kind of issues.

386
00:34:29,631 --> 00:34:31,952
[SPEAKER_19]: So also, it's been a great contract.

387
00:34:31,972 --> 00:34:34,873
[SPEAKER_19]: The GNR is probably one of the best contractors I've worked with.

388
00:34:35,213 --> 00:34:36,053
[SPEAKER_19]: They're very diligent.

389
00:34:36,233 --> 00:34:37,373
[SPEAKER_19]: They follow protocols.

390
00:34:37,893 --> 00:34:39,974
[SPEAKER_19]: They make sure all the OSHA certifications are there.

391
00:34:40,534 --> 00:34:42,034
[SPEAKER_19]: They're really aren't any surprises.

392
00:34:42,374 --> 00:34:44,615
[SPEAKER_19]: They bring everything forthright if it's an unknown condition.

393
00:34:45,281 --> 00:34:47,362
[SPEAKER_19]: We bring things to them that we'd like to consider.

394
00:34:47,422 --> 00:34:48,963
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's been a great job.

395
00:34:49,183 --> 00:34:54,106
[SPEAKER_19]: And as you can see, one of the first moves we made was to move the new fuel island down the street.

396
00:34:54,686 --> 00:34:57,168
[SPEAKER_19]: So the above-ground tanks was the first order of business.

397
00:34:57,688 --> 00:35:05,752
[SPEAKER_19]: So now all the municipal safety and public vehicles can get down to that fuel island, fuel up, and go out without actually going into the construction site.

398
00:35:06,413 --> 00:35:10,715
[SPEAKER_19]: And when we're all done, that area will be maintained as the fuel island.

399
00:35:11,195 --> 00:35:14,037
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll have access gates, and we'll be able to control who goes in, who goes out.

400
00:35:14,722 --> 00:35:21,068
[SPEAKER_19]: There'll also be a public area for the citizens to come down to drop off recycling, plastic bottles, those kind of things.

401
00:35:21,088 --> 00:35:27,533
[SPEAKER_19]: So that'll be segregated from the DPW site and allow the DPW site to kind of be a full municipal operation.

402
00:35:28,054 --> 00:35:38,463
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think every member of the council who voted for this will be very pleased when you see the size of the facility and the fact that you can handle the smallest from the largest piece of equipment and vehicle that the city has.

403
00:35:39,123 --> 00:35:39,664
[SPEAKER_19]: And we did that.

404
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:42,246
[SPEAKER_19]: We took the biggest piece of equipment that we have, engine one,

405
00:35:42,805 --> 00:35:45,586
[SPEAKER_19]: brought it down there to make sure everything fit for maintenance, et cetera.

406
00:35:46,226 --> 00:35:50,547
[SPEAKER_19]: So it'll have all the state-of-the-art facilities, energy-efficient, pre-engineered building.

407
00:35:51,028 --> 00:35:57,470
[SPEAKER_19]: It's got all of the stormwater management runoff capabilities, retrieving the water that you recycle through and dispose of it properly.

408
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:59,370
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's been a great project.

409
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:07,353
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm looking very much forward to finally give the DPW people who go to work every day, and they used to work in tough conditions like I know you know.

410
00:36:07,953 --> 00:36:10,774
[SPEAKER_19]: So to give them a first-class facility and the people of Medford

411
00:36:11,285 --> 00:36:17,010
[SPEAKER_19]: some place they can actually go to and respond to and have an emergency operations when you need it for all vehicles.

412
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:17,691
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm very happy.

413
00:36:18,711 --> 00:36:20,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Any time paid for a completion?

414
00:36:21,093 --> 00:36:21,274
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

415
00:36:21,454 --> 00:36:26,838
[SPEAKER_19]: Looking at full completion occupancy, April the 1st, April the 1st before completion occupancy.

416
00:36:27,499 --> 00:36:30,421
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll have in all projects, you always have substantial completion.

417
00:36:30,441 --> 00:36:37,167
[SPEAKER_19]: Then you have a punch list, but the rate we're going right now, if the weather holds for us, we don't have any kind of mother nature things hit us.

418
00:36:37,207 --> 00:36:38,128
[SPEAKER_19]: I think we'll be in great shape.

419
00:36:39,032 --> 00:36:39,352
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

420
00:36:40,193 --> 00:36:40,533
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

421
00:36:40,553 --> 00:36:40,533
14.

422
00:36:45,096 --> 00:36:51,101
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor.

423
00:36:51,781 --> 00:36:52,562
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion for approval.

424
00:36:54,043 --> 00:36:55,524
[SPEAKER_03]: All in favor.

425
00:36:57,305 --> 00:36:57,945
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed.

426
00:36:58,646 --> 00:37:06,391
[SPEAKER_03]: No motion passes.

427
00:37:06,431 --> 00:37:06,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Which one was that?

428
00:37:12,184 --> 00:37:12,524
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

429
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:19,187
[SPEAKER_03]: You're making a motion for reconsideration?

430
00:37:19,207 --> 00:37:20,548
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, motion for reconsideration on paper 14699.

431
00:37:20,628 --> 00:37:22,869
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, the vote wasn't taken.

432
00:37:22,909 --> 00:37:25,010
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd ask that it be taken in the call of the ayes and nays.

433
00:37:28,471 --> 00:37:29,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion for reconsideration.

434
00:37:30,172 --> 00:37:31,473
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

435
00:37:31,813 --> 00:37:31,913
Aye.

436
00:37:32,313 --> 00:37:35,655
[SPEAKER_07]: Opposed?

437
00:37:36,035 --> 00:37:36,755
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion for approval.

438
00:37:36,975 --> 00:37:38,136
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion for approval, Mr. President.

439
00:37:38,156 --> 00:37:38,816
[SPEAKER_07]: Call of the ayes and nays.

440
00:37:38,836 --> 00:37:40,417
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

441
00:37:40,437 --> 00:37:40,497
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

442
00:37:40,517 --> 00:37:40,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Opposed?

443
00:37:41,622 --> 00:37:42,382
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

444
00:37:44,884 --> 00:37:45,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

445
00:37:48,786 --> 00:38:01,352
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't vote on the last vote.

446
00:38:01,372 --> 00:38:01,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

447
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:01,552
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

448
00:38:01,572 --> 00:38:08,996
[SPEAKER_03]: 14707 petition by Robert G. Abruzzi, 92 High Street Method Mass to address the city council about mailing for the October 28th

449
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:13,582
[SPEAKER_03]: 2014 hearing for Coles extended hours.

450
00:38:19,983 --> 00:38:21,683
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President, members of the council.

451
00:38:21,863 --> 00:38:34,706
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm here in connection with a previously filed petition for a special permit for extended hours of operation, which is to be heard by this council on October 28th, a petition on behalf of Coles.

452
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:48,612
[SPEAKER_08]: And the issue concerns what I'm looking for is the council's approval that the mailing of notice of that hearing be sent by regular mail, which is what the state statute requires.

453
00:38:49,493 --> 00:39:01,615
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently in many cases, I know the city council has previously sent mailing by registered mail return received requested, but since that's not required by the ordinance in this particular case,

454
00:39:02,461 --> 00:39:16,709
[SPEAKER_08]: Because of the condominium building next door, there are 286 abutters, which, at a cost of in excess of $6.50 per certified male, would be an unnecessary cost of approximately $2,000.

455
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:24,174
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's the substance of my request here this evening.

456
00:39:28,196 --> 00:39:29,216
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilwoman, go ahead.

457
00:39:29,316 --> 00:39:31,478
[SPEAKER_13]: Who's requiring you to come before the council to

458
00:39:32,291 --> 00:39:38,516
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I think City Clerk's Office is looking for some clarification, some direction from the Council.

459
00:39:39,077 --> 00:39:39,577
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you know how many?

460
00:39:39,697 --> 00:39:56,411
[SPEAKER_08]: As opposed to City Solicitor, I previously discussed this issue with Council President Camuso and Vice President Caraviello, and they each suggested that I get some confirmation of what I'm telling you today from the City Solicitor.

461
00:39:57,092 --> 00:39:59,694
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe the City Solicitor did provide

462
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:07,624
[SPEAKER_08]: via email, a copy of which I have this evening, to each of you about a week ago, confirming what I'm telling you here this evening.

463
00:40:08,224 --> 00:40:10,305
[SPEAKER_08]: And how many letters total?

464
00:40:10,505 --> 00:40:13,407
[SPEAKER_13]: How many letters total would you have to send?

465
00:40:13,427 --> 00:40:14,567
[SPEAKER_08]: 286 on the abundance list.

466
00:40:14,587 --> 00:40:16,108
[SPEAKER_08]: 286 on the abundance list.

467
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:26,934
[SPEAKER_08]: As a practical matter, more people will get the notice if you send it regular mail than certified, because my experience has been that

468
00:40:27,692 --> 00:40:30,813
[SPEAKER_08]: have the certified letters never get picked up at the post office.

469
00:40:34,475 --> 00:40:34,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight.

470
00:40:35,935 --> 00:40:37,216
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

471
00:40:38,316 --> 00:40:44,499
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't see any reason why we'd hold this one business to a higher standard than what's required under state statute, Mr. President.

472
00:40:44,539 --> 00:40:49,461
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that this is something that's a reasonable request that falls in line with what the law is and I might certainly be supporting it.

473
00:40:49,481 --> 00:40:53,422
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we should move for approval, but I'd like Councilor Marksley to obviously have a chance to talk on it.

474
00:40:54,183 --> 00:40:54,703
[SPEAKER_07]: However, I don't,

475
00:40:55,302 --> 00:40:59,605
[SPEAKER_07]: see any reason why we'd need to hold them to a higher standard or a different standard than that of any other business here in the community.

476
00:40:59,625 --> 00:41:01,706
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

477
00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:02,747
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Dela Rosa.

478
00:41:03,367 --> 00:41:06,389
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President, I am in agreement with Councilor Knight.

479
00:41:06,509 --> 00:41:12,172
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that we should observe the ordinance and statutes before us.

480
00:41:13,113 --> 00:41:14,854
[SPEAKER_06]: This isn't something of a grave matter.

481
00:41:15,574 --> 00:41:21,138
[SPEAKER_06]: And oftentimes with collective housing like you have there in the condo building, there would be a,

482
00:41:22,919 --> 00:41:33,267
[SPEAKER_06]: meeting of the residents and a consensus and single voice often represented by the leadership of their housing council or condo board.

483
00:41:34,688 --> 00:41:37,630
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and this isn't something of a grave matter.

484
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:46,996
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a occasional extension of hours of operation they'd be seeking to have here.

485
00:41:51,651 --> 00:41:54,113
[SPEAKER_03]: This will be setting a precedent going forward, Councilor DelaRosa.

486
00:41:54,914 --> 00:41:57,536
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's what we're going for.

487
00:41:57,936 --> 00:42:07,363
[SPEAKER_06]: The normal means of conveyance of information is by first class mail, so I don't know why anything else would be required.

488
00:42:07,864 --> 00:42:17,871
[SPEAKER_08]: Point of information, I think in some particular circumstances, such as repair shop licenses, your ordinance says that the notice shall be sent certified mail.

489
00:42:18,772 --> 00:42:21,014
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's a different situation.

490
00:42:21,908 --> 00:42:31,054
[SPEAKER_08]: Unless the particular ordinance requires it, I would think that the council ought to be bound by what the state statute is.

491
00:42:31,774 --> 00:42:38,178
[SPEAKER_08]: So there is no special requirement with respect to the extended hours special permit ordinance.

492
00:42:39,439 --> 00:42:41,300
[SPEAKER_08]: Accordingly, I think it ought to go to regular mail.

493
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:49,485
[SPEAKER_06]: If I could, through the chair, and ask the city solicitor to instruct us, are there, in addition to

494
00:42:50,177 --> 00:42:57,763
[SPEAKER_06]: of the requirement for certified mail for repair shops, auto repair shops, and auto body shops.

495
00:42:58,284 --> 00:43:03,488
[SPEAKER_06]: Are there other instances requiring in our ordinances certified mail notification?

496
00:43:03,988 --> 00:43:05,930
[SPEAKER_10]: The major one is repair shop license.

497
00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:10,433
[SPEAKER_10]: I came across that last week specifically when I discussed this with the city clerk.

498
00:43:10,994 --> 00:43:18,140
[SPEAKER_10]: As to special permits, and this extension of ours would be a special permit, the law is set forth in 40A section 10.

499
00:43:18,922 --> 00:43:23,263
[SPEAKER_10]: And it says specifically that notice shall be sent by mail postage prepaid.

500
00:43:23,803 --> 00:43:40,947
[SPEAKER_10]: So after speaking with the city solicitor, excuse me, the city clerk who told me that the notice of this sort has been done by certified mail, uh, since the, uh, Paleozoic era, we tried to look for what, uh, um, reference there was a foundation for that.

501
00:43:41,387 --> 00:43:43,867
[SPEAKER_10]: So we looked through the council resolutions over the years.

502
00:43:43,907 --> 00:43:44,427
[SPEAKER_10]: There is none.

503
00:43:45,407 --> 00:43:46,688
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, look through the council rules.

504
00:43:46,728 --> 00:43:48,188
[SPEAKER_10]: There is nothing that applies to it.

505
00:43:48,905 --> 00:43:53,089
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's nothing that says anything except for what the statute says, which is regular mail.

506
00:43:53,669 --> 00:44:13,746
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, one of the prudent things to do if you're worried about setting a precedent that might come back and be problematic in the future is to refer this to essentially a rules committee or to one of your council business committees so that you can take a look at it with some degree of depth and without having to do so in the quickness of one council meeting.

507
00:44:14,267 --> 00:44:16,809
[SPEAKER_10]: But as to the special permit, the extension of hours,

508
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:19,111
[SPEAKER_10]: 4810 says regular mail.

509
00:44:20,031 --> 00:44:21,031
[SPEAKER_10]: Very, very clearly.

510
00:44:21,791 --> 00:44:27,253
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President, that being said, then I'd, uh, move approval for this, uh, this instance.

511
00:44:27,933 --> 00:44:42,277
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, as a, uh, uh, amendment to the, uh, uh, resolution, refer this to the rules committee, convene a meeting, uh, so that we can, uh, clarify this and deal with it, uh, for the future.

512
00:44:44,878 --> 00:44:45,038
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

513
00:44:45,478 --> 00:44:45,998
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Bender.

514
00:44:48,283 --> 00:44:49,624
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Del Russo, that's absurd.

515
00:44:49,924 --> 00:44:53,887
[SPEAKER_20]: You're not going to vote for something tonight and then refer it back and possibly get a different opinion.

516
00:44:54,387 --> 00:45:00,310
[SPEAKER_20]: All our common vigil licenses we have voted for in the past, Mr. Clark, have been by regular mail.

517
00:45:00,350 --> 00:45:01,791
[SPEAKER_20]: They haven't been by certified mail.

518
00:45:02,212 --> 00:45:05,634
[SPEAKER_20]: Why would Coles be any different than any other common vigil license?

519
00:45:06,794 --> 00:45:07,355
[SPEAKER_20]: Extended hours.

520
00:45:07,875 --> 00:45:08,055
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

521
00:45:08,115 --> 00:45:08,636
[SPEAKER_20]: Why would that be it?

522
00:45:08,656 --> 00:45:15,860
[SPEAKER_03]: No, let the clerk speak.

523
00:45:18,276 --> 00:45:19,236
[SPEAKER_20]: The clerk, the clerk.

524
00:45:20,797 --> 00:45:21,177
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

525
00:45:28,961 --> 00:45:33,783
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not just for, that we've doing it for extended hours.

526
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:37,065
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been doing it this way for any special permit zoning.

527
00:45:37,925 --> 00:45:38,326
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

528
00:45:39,446 --> 00:45:47,710
[SPEAKER_02]: And extended hours for this particular case does fall within the chapter and verse that the city solicitor had indicated.

529
00:45:48,295 --> 00:46:00,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, before I came here, this practice was in place on certified mail, on a special permit and zoning.

530
00:46:02,344 --> 00:46:07,847
[SPEAKER_02]: And to the best of my knowledge, talking to the staff that is here prior to that, they have done it.

531
00:46:08,687 --> 00:46:16,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, going through some research and the city solicitor also looked at it, that I could not find where

532
00:46:17,965 --> 00:46:22,586
[SPEAKER_02]: It instructed our office to make everything certified mail.

533
00:46:23,806 --> 00:46:27,547
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be tucked away in some amendment someplace, but there's no council resolution.

534
00:46:27,587 --> 00:46:29,788
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no council rules and regulations.

535
00:46:30,848 --> 00:46:35,589
[SPEAKER_02]: So it came about somewhere at some time years ago, even before I came.

536
00:46:35,629 --> 00:46:39,870
[SPEAKER_02]: So the practice, when I came in, is that we continued the practice.

537
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:46,331
[SPEAKER_02]: What the attorney at Bruzy is saying, and I've dealt with,

538
00:46:46,697 --> 00:46:57,945
[SPEAKER_02]: attorney at Bruzee for the past 15 years, and he himself has been charged with certified mail, would have only been three of butters or something like that.

539
00:46:57,985 --> 00:47:11,054
[SPEAKER_02]: So the practice going forward, I think, if this was the law of states, I just need some clarification to tell me, to tell our office to follow what the law is saying for all special permits.

540
00:47:12,195 --> 00:47:14,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I don't know where it came from.

541
00:47:14,457 --> 00:47:15,758
[SPEAKER_02]: It was beyond me.

542
00:47:16,921 --> 00:47:22,024
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and it must have been a generated, maybe from the city council at some meeting or whatever like that.

543
00:47:22,065 --> 00:47:40,277
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, this is, uh, so for me to go forward, I not only could have to do is treat, uh, Mr. Bruzzi's, uh, client, but I think anybody that falls into the special permit, you know, even if it's one, it should go out, uh, the general mail and be, and be a charged accordingly.

544
00:47:41,298 --> 00:47:44,480
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just not just the calls it's no, cause we did Kelly's,

545
00:47:45,314 --> 00:48:00,621
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe six years ago, and it must have cost them over $2,000, because they had two complexes across the street, you know, and they had drive-thru in, they had extended out, so.

546
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:02,522
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

547
00:48:02,582 --> 00:48:07,144
[SPEAKER_13]: If I could ask Clerk Finn a question about this, because it seems like an easy vote.

548
00:48:07,204 --> 00:48:09,866
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, it looks like it would be about $1,800 for coals.

549
00:48:13,138 --> 00:48:15,879
[SPEAKER_13]: process-wise, who sends out the certified mails?

550
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:18,719
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be Coles that sends out the certified mails?

551
00:48:18,799 --> 00:48:19,059
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

552
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:32,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Our office would prepare all the certified mail, then charge Coles, or the attorney, the cost of the certified mail.

553
00:48:34,363 --> 00:48:36,704
[SPEAKER_02]: All the work would be done in our office.

554
00:48:36,764 --> 00:48:38,024
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a lot of work.

555
00:48:38,064 --> 00:48:41,225
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's a lot of work for general mail, too, quite frankly.

556
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:48,443
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's not like it's, I want to say, a moneymaker for anybody, because the only person that is getting it is the U.S.

557
00:48:48,503 --> 00:48:49,383
[SPEAKER_02]: Postal Service.

558
00:48:50,144 --> 00:48:53,225
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't charge more than what the certified mail has.

559
00:48:53,305 --> 00:49:01,249
[SPEAKER_02]: And now, if you understand the certified mail, in the last two years, it's probably gone up maybe over $2 per piece in the last couple of years.

560
00:49:02,310 --> 00:49:05,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Since the last time we did a big project, like I said, Kelly's like this, you know.

561
00:49:06,252 --> 00:49:08,533
[SPEAKER_13]: That was my question, because it would be a concern of mine if

562
00:49:08,943 --> 00:49:14,064
[SPEAKER_13]: Coles had to do the certified mail or send it out regular mail, just with regards to proving that they did so.

563
00:49:14,404 --> 00:49:20,126
[SPEAKER_13]: But if that's the case where the city clerk's office sends out whether it be certified or regular mail.

564
00:49:20,146 --> 00:49:23,286
[SPEAKER_02]: But it shouldn't be just, it shouldn't be really, from my end of the case, it shouldn't be just Coles.

565
00:49:23,346 --> 00:49:25,767
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be whatever the law has written for all the special partners.

566
00:49:25,787 --> 00:49:26,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.

567
00:49:28,388 --> 00:49:30,128
[SPEAKER_20]: Point of clarification, Mr. Clark, solicitor.

568
00:49:33,049 --> 00:49:38,510
[SPEAKER_20]: To the best of your knowledge, is the repair shops the only one by statute

569
00:49:39,032 --> 00:49:40,473
[SPEAKER_20]: that requires certified mail?

570
00:49:40,733 --> 00:49:49,658
[SPEAKER_10]: When I went through the council rules and the ordinances, and I used the search word, certified, it was for repair shops.

571
00:49:49,958 --> 00:49:50,338
[SPEAKER_10]: That was it?

572
00:49:50,518 --> 00:49:51,379
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all I could find.

573
00:49:53,260 --> 00:50:02,865
[SPEAKER_20]: So it would seem that whether the practice was right or wrong in the past, if this be the case now, and this is the state statute, and we don't have anything to challenge this, this is what the law is.

574
00:50:03,585 --> 00:50:04,806
[SPEAKER_20]: It's clearly what the law is.

575
00:50:04,866 --> 00:50:05,786
[SPEAKER_20]: By regular mail.

576
00:50:06,066 --> 00:50:06,247
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

577
00:50:06,407 --> 00:50:08,488
[SPEAKER_20]: So we don't need any meeting, Councilor De La

578
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:10,320
[SPEAKER_20]: to try to figure this out.

579
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:11,681
[SPEAKER_20]: I think it's quite obvious.

580
00:50:14,282 --> 00:50:14,883
[SPEAKER_09]: Move approval.

581
00:50:15,763 --> 00:50:16,324
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Marks.

582
00:50:17,625 --> 00:50:18,565
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

583
00:50:18,745 --> 00:50:20,366
[SPEAKER_09]: And I agree.

584
00:50:20,426 --> 00:50:32,635
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the fact that a certified meal is not the letter of the law, that past practice, which has happened according to the city clerk for the last 75 years, kind of goes out the window.

585
00:50:33,435 --> 00:50:38,879
[SPEAKER_09]: And we should conform to whatever the current standard is, which is prepaid postage.

586
00:50:39,587 --> 00:50:51,600
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's acceptable, I think, from what I'm hearing the city clerk ask is that we direct him to do away with past practice, which was certified, and to follow the letter of the law.

587
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,563
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think, is that correct, what you're looking for, Mr. Clerk?

588
00:50:54,883 --> 00:50:57,466
[SPEAKER_09]: And that would apply to everyone, so we're not going to pick and choose.

589
00:50:58,133 --> 00:51:02,274
[SPEAKER_20]: who this is going to apply to.

590
00:51:03,775 --> 00:51:10,276
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, but that's a separate, that's a separate, excuse me, that's a separate section of the ordinances.

591
00:51:10,736 --> 00:51:15,218
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think part of the reasoning behind that is because of the use of flammable fluids and other things.

592
00:51:18,699 --> 00:51:21,099
[SPEAKER_13]: If I may, thank you, President Caraviello.

593
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:24,080
[SPEAKER_13]: Where you have the return receipt,

594
00:51:24,396 --> 00:51:32,502
[SPEAKER_13]: when somebody comes into the office, say, somebody says, I didn't get the notice, and you then have the return receipt to say, yes, you did.

595
00:51:32,522 --> 00:51:35,984
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, is there, can we amend this?

596
00:51:36,464 --> 00:51:43,649
[SPEAKER_13]: You can require it, regular mail, but take a picture of each envelope showing, you know, that it went out?

597
00:51:44,289 --> 00:51:50,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we have the, we have the butters list that shows who's been sent out to.

598
00:51:52,364 --> 00:51:58,407
[SPEAKER_13]: My only concern would be if somebody comes in saying, I didn't get the notice.

599
00:51:58,567 --> 00:52:00,647
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, now you don't have the return receipt anymore.

600
00:52:01,248 --> 00:52:03,669
[SPEAKER_02]: I have notices probably this much out here.

601
00:52:03,709 --> 00:52:10,271
[SPEAKER_02]: And the last time we did it, that they didn't go and pick up their certified mail.

602
00:52:10,752 --> 00:52:11,592
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?

603
00:52:12,652 --> 00:52:13,573
[SPEAKER_13]: But that's a different issue.

604
00:52:13,633 --> 00:52:15,514
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but I mean, it's the same thing.

605
00:52:15,594 --> 00:52:17,975
[SPEAKER_02]: But they tell me they didn't get it the same time.

606
00:52:18,055 --> 00:52:18,615
[SPEAKER_02]: I says, I know.

607
00:52:18,655 --> 00:52:20,096
[SPEAKER_02]: But you have the proof.

608
00:52:20,116 --> 00:52:20,876
[SPEAKER_02]: It was three attempts.

609
00:52:21,521 --> 00:52:31,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, you know, I mean, to copy, you're asking us to copy, you know, I don't know what Cole's is, 300, 400 envelopes, I mean.

610
00:52:31,445 --> 00:52:31,665
[SPEAKER_13]: 286, yeah.

611
00:52:32,986 --> 00:52:41,730
[SPEAKER_10]: If I could make a suggestion, you could use the rules that were used in the civil procedure rules and just have a certificate of service executed by the person that sent it out.

612
00:52:41,790 --> 00:52:43,471
[SPEAKER_10]: In this case, it would be the city clerk's office.

613
00:52:44,011 --> 00:52:49,113
[SPEAKER_10]: Or you could ask that the petitioner sign a document saying that they have provided

614
00:52:49,618 --> 00:52:57,921
[SPEAKER_10]: this list of abutters to the city clerk's office and just use a return of service as opposed to photocopying 300 envelopes.

615
00:53:00,002 --> 00:53:01,723
[SPEAKER_13]: Certificate of, yeah, I think we should require.

616
00:53:01,743 --> 00:53:05,945
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you get that anyways from the assessor that he certified these.

617
00:53:05,965 --> 00:53:14,928
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, he certifies the list, but a separate certification which says that mail went out to those persons at those addresses, which would only have to be a paragraph.

618
00:53:15,549 --> 00:53:16,629
[SPEAKER_13]: From the city clerk's office.

619
00:53:16,669 --> 00:53:18,030
[SPEAKER_13]: I would make that recommendation.

620
00:53:18,090 --> 00:53:18,590
[SPEAKER_13]: Some, I mean,

621
00:53:19,416 --> 00:53:30,986
[SPEAKER_13]: going quickly, but something to prove that with an affidavit or a certification, that each one on that list was mailed by regular mail, the notice.

622
00:53:31,726 --> 00:53:33,768
[SPEAKER_20]: The post office will give you a receipt and stamp it.

623
00:53:34,349 --> 00:53:38,592
[SPEAKER_20]: And if you're signing up 286 and it's off on the city of Bedford, they'll time it, they'll date it, and they'll stamp it.

624
00:53:38,933 --> 00:53:40,994
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, for the amount of the postage that was paid.

625
00:53:41,315 --> 00:53:43,717
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, they would, with the number of items that are on the list.

626
00:53:43,757 --> 00:53:43,937
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

627
00:53:44,898 --> 00:53:47,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but we don't, we do our mail service here.

628
00:53:48,289 --> 00:54:01,818
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to the post office with a stack of calls, you know, mails, you know, clerk certifies everything to be sworn and true.

629
00:54:01,858 --> 00:54:02,639
[SPEAKER_06]: That's his job.

630
00:54:02,719 --> 00:54:07,702
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and so doing, uh, carrying out the office of his work, he can, he can do that.

631
00:54:07,722 --> 00:54:09,944
[SPEAKER_03]: I think

632
00:54:12,477 --> 00:54:14,799
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, we're dealing with two separate issues here.

633
00:54:14,819 --> 00:54:22,847
[SPEAKER_07]: We're dealing with the matter that's before us, which it appears that, you know, Coles does have the right to just mail these out pre-postage.

634
00:54:22,907 --> 00:54:27,972
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything else that we want to do that might well fall under the suggestion that Councilor Dello Russo had going forward.

635
00:54:30,696 --> 00:54:36,178
[SPEAKER_03]: that this is not just for calls specifically, but going forward, this is going to be the procedure.

636
00:54:36,198 --> 00:54:36,358
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

637
00:54:36,378 --> 00:54:44,021
[SPEAKER_07]: So going forward, maybe we should consider Councilor De La Ruta's suggestion that we can go and we can refer that matter to the Rules Committee and come up with something that we can all live with.

638
00:54:44,341 --> 00:54:46,802
[SPEAKER_07]: But as of right now, in this point in time, there is no requirement.

639
00:54:47,282 --> 00:54:50,904
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that what we should do, Mr. President, would be move for approval on this paper.

640
00:54:50,924 --> 00:54:57,646
[SPEAKER_07]: And then if, in fact, we need to come up with a process or a policy that the Rules Committee can do such and report it back to the Committee of the Whole for further deliberation.

641
00:55:00,476 --> 00:55:06,760
[SPEAKER_02]: two other special permits in the bank so I'm ready to go.

642
00:55:07,461 --> 00:55:11,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything we decide tonight will be the procedure we use going forward.

643
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:13,144
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, until we change the procedure.

644
00:55:13,605 --> 00:55:14,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Or create a procedure.

645
00:55:14,605 --> 00:55:16,486
[SPEAKER_07]: There is no procedure to change.

646
00:55:16,627 --> 00:55:17,967
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now there is one.

647
00:55:18,087 --> 00:55:20,109
[SPEAKER_03]: We're abiding by the current.

648
00:55:20,409 --> 00:55:28,714
[SPEAKER_10]: There is a procedure and it's set forth in the state statute and the other petitioners, whoever they are, should be treated in the exact same way as this petitioner because that's the law.

649
00:55:29,255 --> 00:55:29,675
[SPEAKER_10]: It's simple.

650
00:55:29,978 --> 00:55:37,022
[SPEAKER_07]: And if there are some internal controls that the council feels that those should be made, photocopying of the envelope, so on and so forth, that's all well and good.

651
00:55:39,284 --> 00:55:41,225
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, motion for approval on this one.

652
00:55:41,925 --> 00:55:42,446
[SPEAKER_03]: All in favor?

653
00:55:42,906 --> 00:55:42,986
Aye.

654
00:55:43,546 --> 00:55:43,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Opposed?

655
00:55:45,528 --> 00:55:45,788
[SPEAKER_03]: None.

656
00:55:46,628 --> 00:55:46,948
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

657
00:55:47,329 --> 00:55:47,649
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

658
00:55:47,669 --> 00:55:50,130
[SPEAKER_03]: 6-0, motion passes.

659
00:55:54,533 --> 00:55:57,235
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion by Councilor Pentland, we revert back to regular business.

660
00:56:00,512 --> 00:56:12,743
[SPEAKER_03]: 14700 offered by councillor Penta, be it resolved that in the interest of public safety for bicyclists and the driving public, a state law proposal be forwarded to our state legislature regarding such matter.

661
00:56:13,384 --> 00:56:17,087
[SPEAKER_03]: A further explanation to be furnished at the council meeting.

662
00:56:17,607 --> 00:56:18,248
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Penta.

663
00:56:21,352 --> 00:56:23,433
[SPEAKER_20]: bicycle enthusiasts out there.

664
00:56:24,033 --> 00:56:30,996
[SPEAKER_20]: We all know we've seen a great influx of bicyclists in our community, as a matter of fact, in the whole Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

665
00:56:31,716 --> 00:56:41,460
[SPEAKER_20]: And if anybody read Sunday's newspaper in the Boston Globe, they had printed a story about bike fatalities in the greater Boston suburbs and how they've increased from 2010, 11, and 12.

666
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:43,541
[SPEAKER_20]: Unfortunately, some people died.

667
00:56:50,548 --> 00:56:53,070
[SPEAKER_20]: And apparently, that's unfortunate.

668
00:56:53,150 --> 00:56:57,574
[SPEAKER_20]: It's an issue right now, I think, that needs to be dealt with as it relates to the public safety portion of it.

669
00:56:59,795 --> 00:57:03,258
[SPEAKER_20]: The popularity of biking is greatly soared.

670
00:57:03,719 --> 00:57:05,400
[SPEAKER_20]: And state policy, Mass.

671
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:18,010
[SPEAKER_20]: Department of Transportation, and local communities, like Somerville, who's basically one of the communities, like Boston, that's in the forefront of having bicycle-friendly roadways

672
00:57:18,790 --> 00:57:21,752
[SPEAKER_20]: and amenities that would be complementary to them.

673
00:57:22,453 --> 00:57:41,766
[SPEAKER_20]: But the concern, as it relates to where we're going with all these bicycle and bicycle paths in communities such as Medford, which has a bicycle commission, just how much of an input, and more importantly, how much of a control do we have?

674
00:57:41,786 --> 00:57:44,888
[SPEAKER_20]: Out of the 557 schools in the Commonwealth

675
00:57:48,129 --> 00:57:51,291
[SPEAKER_20]: signed up on the state DOT program.

676
00:57:51,331 --> 00:57:59,494
[SPEAKER_20]: Only 17 of them are actually implementing bicycle safety programs that at least meet the minimal standards that Mass.

677
00:57:59,514 --> 00:58:02,216
[SPEAKER_20]: Department of Transportation is asking for.

678
00:58:02,236 --> 00:58:16,622
[SPEAKER_20]: The confusion that's taking place on the roadway, especially for people who are driving cars as compared to when they look at a cyclist, is that, you know, who in fact has the right of way?

679
00:58:16,662 --> 00:58:17,723
[SPEAKER_20]: Who's got the rules of the road?

680
00:58:18,343 --> 00:58:20,925
[SPEAKER_20]: who's supposed to follow what, when, and how.

681
00:58:21,245 --> 00:58:45,865
[SPEAKER_20]: And the educational process, once again, really should fall on local communities, because if local communities are going to start with having bicycle-friendly streets and providing certain roadways or pathways or whatever the terminology might be that you would want to have for bicyclists, an educational process needs to take place.

682
00:58:46,245 --> 00:58:47,346
[SPEAKER_20]: And if it doesn't take place,

683
00:58:48,297 --> 00:58:48,898
[SPEAKER_20]: There's a concern.

684
00:58:48,918 --> 00:58:54,162
[SPEAKER_20]: There's a concern to the bicyclist, the person driving the bike, riding the bike, and the person driving the car.

685
00:58:54,703 --> 00:59:00,547
[SPEAKER_20]: And because of that, you know, this prompted me to turn around and think about, you know, it's great.

686
00:59:00,587 --> 00:59:02,749
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a great form of exercise medically.

687
00:59:02,809 --> 00:59:05,351
[SPEAKER_20]: We all know that riding a bike is great.

688
00:59:05,972 --> 00:59:11,937
[SPEAKER_20]: But we also know that there's a concern that's predicating some of these safety issues.

689
00:59:12,597 --> 00:59:15,860
[SPEAKER_20]: And one of the concerns seems to be the speed of some of the

690
00:59:16,203 --> 00:59:17,904
[SPEAKER_20]: cyclist when they're riding their bikes.

691
00:59:18,584 --> 00:59:23,087
[SPEAKER_20]: And the other one, going through stop signs and driving through crosswalks.

692
00:59:24,068 --> 00:59:38,016
[SPEAKER_20]: And they seem to be the three major concerns of the cities and towns that I reviewed in the Mass State Department of Transportation's concerns, since they've now started to inventory bicycle accidents.

693
00:59:38,516 --> 00:59:43,179
[SPEAKER_20]: But Boston thus far has yet to do an inventory of bicycle accidents.

694
00:59:44,841 --> 00:59:59,968
[SPEAKER_20]: Bicycles, again, according to Section 11B of Chapter 85, bicycles shall be subject to the traffic laws and regulations of the Commonwealth and special regulations as found in the particular section.

695
01:00:00,408 --> 01:00:07,992
[SPEAKER_20]: And the section that I want to get into is the bike in and of itself in hours after dark, before dusk and after dark.

696
01:00:09,392 --> 01:00:12,474
[SPEAKER_20]: The operator, this is what the law says, that the operator shall display

697
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:19,662
[SPEAKER_20]: To the front of the bicycle, a lamp emitting a white light visible from a distance of at least 500 feet.

698
01:00:20,562 --> 01:00:26,463
[SPEAKER_20]: In the rear of the bicycle, a light emanating — a red light emanating for not less than 600 feet.

699
01:00:26,523 --> 01:00:38,366
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, if you can imagine what it's like driving a car at nighttime and looking out 600 feet and looking at a little dinky red light, good luck to you, because a lot of the times they don't exist.

700
01:00:38,966 --> 01:00:43,007
[SPEAKER_20]: And a lot of the folks that are driving these bikes don't even have these lights on.

701
01:00:43,485 --> 01:00:53,830
[SPEAKER_20]: So now we get into initial call enforcement, and where the police department, another part of their job, but bikes are having their way on the roadways, and rightfully so.

702
01:00:54,350 --> 01:00:57,451
[SPEAKER_20]: And they deserve to be protected just as much as the person driving the car.

703
01:00:58,031 --> 01:01:02,673
[SPEAKER_20]: And they also talk about having on the ankles some type of reflective material.

704
01:01:03,654 --> 01:01:06,995
[SPEAKER_20]: And once I saw this thing about the reflective material, that's the thing that got to me.

705
01:01:08,436 --> 01:01:12,598
[SPEAKER_20]: I would like to propose, and hopefully my colleagues will be supportive, and also

706
01:01:13,634 --> 01:01:31,085
[SPEAKER_20]: I had a conversation with Bruce Kulick, who happens to be the chairman of the Bicycle Commission, and I think we're on the same page on this one, that the drivers of a bicycle at nighttime wear some type of a jacket or whatever it might be of a reflective type of material.

707
01:01:31,105 --> 01:01:37,168
[SPEAKER_20]: How many times have you driven down the street at nighttime and you see someone with dark clothes on in a crosswalk and you might miss them?

708
01:01:37,709 --> 01:01:41,651
[SPEAKER_20]: How many times do you see a bike driving down the street at dusk and even late at night

709
01:01:42,665 --> 01:01:50,230
[SPEAKER_20]: and have absolutely nothing on that would identify them as a person on a bike by way of color, reflection, or what have you.

710
01:01:50,850 --> 01:02:05,279
[SPEAKER_20]: There is no state law out there right now that makes it a mandatory requirement for the purposes of a male or female driving a bicycle having a reflector jacket type of garment on them.

711
01:02:08,278 --> 01:02:11,580
[SPEAKER_20]: This is going to be taking up the same type of fuel.

712
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:24,107
[SPEAKER_20]: It's going to be building up momentum, because as we know, the law that's out there, trying to be out there, that you can't text and drive at the same time, because we know the consequences that can happen by way of accidents.

713
01:02:24,827 --> 01:02:31,031
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, the same thing is going to be happening with these bicyclists, because we know that they're becoming more and more of them out there.

714
01:02:31,491 --> 01:02:34,933
[SPEAKER_20]: Each and every community, including Medford, have more and more bicyclists.

715
01:02:35,313 --> 01:02:36,774
[SPEAKER_20]: And bicycle folks are going to drive

716
01:02:37,070 --> 01:02:39,071
[SPEAKER_20]: whether they come from Medford or out of town or what have you.

717
01:02:39,791 --> 01:02:48,674
[SPEAKER_20]: But there has to be some mode of protection and identification that is protective to these folks that are driving a bike.

718
01:02:49,914 --> 01:03:06,839
[SPEAKER_20]: And again, there is nothing in the state law that really goes out of its way that basically says, other than some little, and I'll call it stupid thing you put on your ankle, that who the hell is going to see a reflector thing 600 feet away, as compared to maybe having a reflector type jacket.

719
01:03:07,763 --> 01:03:10,725
[SPEAKER_20]: that identifies itself, green, yellow, orange, whatever it might be.

720
01:03:11,506 --> 01:03:21,935
[SPEAKER_20]: It may not be the most social-looking piece of garment you'd want to wear, but if it's going to protect and save your life, you know, it does the thing.

721
01:03:22,976 --> 01:03:36,627
[SPEAKER_20]: So, with that being said, Mr. President, and I don't know if there's anybody here from the Bicycle Commission who would like to speak on it or what have you, but I would appreciate not only their comments, but more importantly, their support for this because

722
01:03:37,659 --> 01:04:01,556
[SPEAKER_20]: Again, reviewing the accidents as they have been presented and looking at the statistics, and I believe the statistics are going up, they're not going down, on bicycle accidents and, unfortunately, people dying from bicycle accidents, and I believe every single one of them have not been identified with anything at nighttime that would be reflective type of material that would present a safety condition for the person riding the bike.

723
01:04:04,632 --> 01:04:07,114
[SPEAKER_17]: Sure, my name is Tim McGivern, 623 Watervale Road.

724
01:04:07,134 --> 01:04:09,496
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm on the Medford Bicycle Advisory Commission.

725
01:04:10,356 --> 01:04:20,925
[SPEAKER_17]: I think, are you proposing that Medford have some sort of ordinance that requires reflective vests for bicycles?

726
01:04:21,045 --> 01:04:29,952
[SPEAKER_17]: Or are you proposing that the city council recommend legislature to the state legislature?

727
01:04:35,502 --> 01:04:56,597
[SPEAKER_20]: I am proposing the same way the state legislature has these amendments that have been forthcoming and the law has amended that we again amend the law that makes a requirement statewide for any person riding a bicycle from dawn to dusk that they have to wear some type of reflective type of material easily identifiable by a headlight and an oncoming car or a car behind you or whatever.

728
01:04:57,577 --> 01:05:01,540
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that anything to increase the safety of cyclists on the road is a good idea.

729
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:08,541
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think wearing a vest that's reflective when you're riding your bicycle is increasing your safety on the road, and therefore it's a good idea.

730
01:05:09,121 --> 01:05:13,982
[SPEAKER_17]: So I do not oppose such a movement, but I do not speak for the entire bicycle commission.

731
01:05:14,002 --> 01:05:15,223
[SPEAKER_17]: We would need to deliberate on that.

732
01:05:15,723 --> 01:05:16,043
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

733
01:05:22,024 --> 01:05:23,584
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

734
01:05:24,324 --> 01:05:26,305
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Penser, I think you mentioned the Mass General Law.

735
01:05:29,337 --> 01:05:32,900
[SPEAKER_13]: which I read as that's already a requirement.

736
01:05:36,162 --> 01:05:44,267
[SPEAKER_13]: One half hour after sunset to one half hour before sunrise, the operator shall display on each pedal of his bicycle a reflector.

737
01:05:45,268 --> 01:05:46,109
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not talking about that.

738
01:05:46,369 --> 01:05:50,311
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm talking about wearing a jacket, something that could be seen and highly visible.

739
01:05:50,632 --> 01:05:51,773
[SPEAKER_20]: If you ever get behind a car 600 feet,

740
01:05:52,992 --> 01:06:01,614
[SPEAKER_20]: and try to find that little reflector on the pedal, or on their foot, or the little red light behind a bike that 90% of the time doesn't work, and they run by battery.

741
01:06:02,214 --> 01:06:10,856
[SPEAKER_20]: Or you see a little white headlight that's 500 feet away on a bike that doesn't cut the mustard when a car is driving down the street, or even if a truck is driving down the street.

742
01:06:10,876 --> 01:06:14,076
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, it's, it's.

743
01:06:14,997 --> 01:06:18,537
[SPEAKER_13]: So you're proposing that the state legislate it.

744
01:06:18,957 --> 01:06:19,337
[SPEAKER_20]: Amend it.

745
01:06:19,778 --> 01:06:21,658
[SPEAKER_13]: Amend it, so instead of just the lamp,

746
01:06:22,712 --> 01:06:28,196
[SPEAKER_13]: which is required on the front of the bike or the pedal on the reflector be increased to a vest.

747
01:06:28,537 --> 01:06:29,017
[SPEAKER_20]: To a vest.

748
01:06:29,457 --> 01:06:32,659
[SPEAKER_20]: Or a garment type of material, vest, jacket, or what have you.

749
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:39,084
[SPEAKER_13]: What if we send this to the Bicycle Commission as well, or prior to, to have them discuss?

750
01:06:39,184 --> 01:06:41,746
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, there are two members here tonight.

751
01:06:41,766 --> 01:06:43,267
[SPEAKER_13]: I've spoken to Bruce as well.

752
01:06:43,667 --> 01:06:46,289
[SPEAKER_13]: How many people are on the committee as of right now?

753
01:06:48,973 --> 01:06:53,454
[SPEAKER_13]: 10 people from Medford on the committee who probably speak to a number of other cyclists.

754
01:06:53,854 --> 01:06:54,875
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's get some input.

755
01:06:55,215 --> 01:06:57,235
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree with it.

756
01:06:58,375 --> 01:07:00,376
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's refer to the Bicycle Commission first.

757
01:07:00,396 --> 01:07:01,696
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be my suggestion.

758
01:07:01,716 --> 01:07:08,078
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's a great resolve, and I think anything to enhance safety for bicyclists is a positive step.

759
01:07:08,538 --> 01:07:10,038
[SPEAKER_13]: I agree with Councilor Penter as well.

760
01:07:10,098 --> 01:07:15,480
[SPEAKER_13]: Enforcement is going to be a big thing, not only for vehicles, but also to put on these vests.

761
01:07:16,574 --> 01:07:40,717
[SPEAKER_17]: I think there are some details that need to be worked out as far as what this vest or coat looks like, what it is, and do you have to wear it if you are, say, riding down the sidewalk in a type of neighborhood in Massachusetts that seems silly to wear that vest, like a pedestrian, for example, crossing the street.

762
01:07:40,757 --> 01:07:41,558
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think there are things.

763
01:07:41,948 --> 01:07:45,270
[SPEAKER_17]: that can be discussed by the bicycle commission.

764
01:07:45,610 --> 01:07:53,954
[SPEAKER_17]: And I would like to ask that the city council table this until we had a chance to discuss it and make a recommendation to the city council.

765
01:07:55,095 --> 01:07:56,156
[SPEAKER_17]: A point of clarification.

766
01:07:58,017 --> 01:08:01,378
[SPEAKER_20]: This is directed toward people who drive a bike.

767
01:08:02,599 --> 01:08:05,881
[SPEAKER_20]: And I believe the cyclists that drive a bike have to wear a helmet.

768
01:08:05,901 --> 01:08:07,101
[SPEAKER_20]: Isn't that required by law too?

769
01:08:07,562 --> 01:08:07,982
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe so.

770
01:08:08,182 --> 01:08:08,282
[SPEAKER_20]: OK.

771
01:08:10,126 --> 01:08:18,852
[SPEAKER_20]: If somebody decides from dawn to dusk they want to drive a bike on a sidewalk or a street, the requirement's going to be the same because you're riding a bike.

772
01:08:19,012 --> 01:08:26,738
[SPEAKER_20]: And according to Chapter 85, Section, I think it's 10 and 11, there are certain requirements that you have to follow the same rules of the road.

773
01:08:26,818 --> 01:08:35,544
[SPEAKER_20]: And the only exception to the rules of the road, I believe, if you're going, exiting, or entering on a highway and anything else that might be specifically excluded by state statute.

774
01:08:36,100 --> 01:08:37,621
[SPEAKER_20]: So I think we're all on the same page.

775
01:08:37,701 --> 01:08:38,321
[SPEAKER_20]: I think so too.

776
01:08:38,441 --> 01:08:44,004
[SPEAKER_20]: And the more, I think the more support we get for it, you know, and explaining it, I think it, you know, it bears fruit.

777
01:08:44,244 --> 01:08:46,825
[SPEAKER_20]: This isn't like wearing a heavy jacket and the winter time.

778
01:08:46,865 --> 01:08:48,126
[SPEAKER_20]: It's just, you know, it's something.

779
01:08:48,306 --> 01:08:49,367
[SPEAKER_17]: I know exactly what you mean.

780
01:08:49,387 --> 01:08:49,827
[SPEAKER_17]: I've seen it.

781
01:08:49,867 --> 01:08:50,587
[SPEAKER_17]: I wear one myself.

782
01:08:51,267 --> 01:08:54,729
[SPEAKER_17]: What I'm asking for is just the opportunity for the commission to discuss it.

783
01:08:54,989 --> 01:08:58,331
[SPEAKER_17]: And we could even formalize a recommendation to the city council, but not all.

784
01:09:00,012 --> 01:09:01,052
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight.

785
01:09:01,112 --> 01:09:02,413
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

786
01:09:03,407 --> 01:09:05,128
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree with Mr. Givern wholeheartedly.

787
01:09:05,188 --> 01:09:07,629
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that the Bicycle Commission meets rather frequently.

788
01:09:07,669 --> 01:09:14,291
[SPEAKER_07]: They have a large board of people that are probably much more avid cyclists than anybody behind this rail.

789
01:09:14,971 --> 01:09:16,352
[SPEAKER_07]: They know the dangers that they face.

790
01:09:16,692 --> 01:09:21,854
[SPEAKER_07]: They know what the city needs to do to make them safer, because they're out there every day on these roads, Mr. President.

791
01:09:21,874 --> 01:09:29,497
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it would make sense if we got an advisory opinion from the Bicycle Commission to see what direction that they'd like to see us go.

792
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:34,482
[SPEAKER_07]: a number of issues aside from public safety and how to make Medford more bicycle-friendly.

793
01:09:35,023 --> 01:09:43,748
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that maybe if we look at this in a more comprehensive fashion, if we're going to send something to the legislature, that would be worth its weight.

794
01:09:43,768 --> 01:09:45,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you like to see us refer it to the Public Safety Committee?

795
01:09:46,690 --> 01:09:51,193
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to table the matter and have it be sent to the Bicycle Commission for recommendation.

796
01:09:51,213 --> 01:09:52,733
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we can bring it back to the floor for discussion.

797
01:09:54,735 --> 01:09:55,475
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Dello Russo.

798
01:09:56,156 --> 01:09:59,998
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd also recommend that the Bicycle Commission, since it never has,

799
01:10:01,220 --> 01:10:14,845
[SPEAKER_06]: take the opportunity to meet with us and committee of the whole to just present to the council what they're doing, they're discussing and their role in the city so that we can be apprised of that as a body.

800
01:10:17,506 --> 01:10:19,027
[SPEAKER_06]: So would you prefer to retable this or?

801
01:10:19,047 --> 01:10:21,668
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm referring to the bicycle.

802
01:10:22,128 --> 01:10:22,208
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

803
01:10:22,228 --> 01:10:26,130
[SPEAKER_06]: We send it back to them and then have the president convene a meeting in the future.

804
01:10:26,150 --> 01:10:26,450
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

805
01:10:26,490 --> 01:10:29,551
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you gentlemen can take this back to Mr. Kulik.

806
01:10:31,507 --> 01:10:34,688
[SPEAKER_17]: We agree and we'd love the opportunity to do that and so we'll look forward to it.

807
01:10:34,708 --> 01:10:37,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Does anyone else want to speak in this matter?

808
01:10:37,309 --> 01:10:40,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Gene, did you want to speak?

809
01:10:40,109 --> 01:10:45,010
[SPEAKER_03]: The motion is that we send this back to the bicycle committee for their review and they will get back to us.

810
01:10:46,311 --> 01:10:47,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Penta.

811
01:10:47,851 --> 01:10:59,934
[SPEAKER_20]: One quick thing, and I brought up an issue, there's 557 schools at the present time that are supposed to be, that are allegedly participants in the Department of Transportation public safety program for schools.

812
01:11:00,448 --> 01:11:04,151
[SPEAKER_20]: And only 17 of these communities have jumped on board.

813
01:11:04,632 --> 01:11:06,133
[SPEAKER_20]: Is Method one of the 17 or not?

814
01:11:07,094 --> 01:11:07,675
[SPEAKER_20]: Are you aware of?

815
01:11:07,695 --> 01:11:11,958
[SPEAKER_18]: Name and address of the record, please.

816
01:11:12,019 --> 01:11:14,160
[SPEAKER_18]: Jason Cluggish, 16 6th Street.

817
01:11:15,582 --> 01:11:18,544
[SPEAKER_18]: I believe you're talking about the Safe Routes to School program.

818
01:11:18,564 --> 01:11:19,005
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, right.

819
01:11:19,225 --> 01:11:23,949
[SPEAKER_18]: And I believe that the Roberts School has signed up.

820
01:11:24,982 --> 01:11:28,104
[SPEAKER_18]: But I am unaware of any other Medford public school has.

821
01:11:28,184 --> 01:11:29,425
[SPEAKER_20]: But see, that's the issue.

822
01:11:29,525 --> 01:11:33,588
[SPEAKER_20]: Signing up as compared to having the program implemented, that's the issue.

823
01:11:34,908 --> 01:11:39,231
[SPEAKER_17]: There is someone that works on the Board of Health, happens to be my wife, that's working with schools.

824
01:11:39,511 --> 01:11:42,673
[SPEAKER_17]: She's the, what is it called?

825
01:11:42,794 --> 01:11:45,615
[SPEAKER_17]: She's coordinating the grant from the Massachusetts Health Department.

826
01:11:45,775 --> 01:11:51,119
[SPEAKER_17]: And one of the programs she's working on is implementing Safe Routes to Schools in Medford.

827
01:11:51,707 --> 01:11:55,992
[SPEAKER_20]: So right now the Roberts was on the book, but we haven't implemented the program yet.

828
01:11:56,853 --> 01:12:01,638
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe that it is being implemented.

829
01:12:02,028 --> 01:12:08,953
[SPEAKER_17]: which part of being implemented is working towards all the requirements of it.

830
01:12:10,314 --> 01:12:17,200
[SPEAKER_17]: So I can't speak 100% on it, but we do have someone in City Hall working on that task.

831
01:12:17,540 --> 01:12:18,421
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, thank you.

832
01:12:18,781 --> 01:12:25,026
[SPEAKER_18]: I should also mention that the Advisory Commission, Bicycle Advisory Commission, is looking into the Safe Roads to School.

833
01:12:25,726 --> 01:12:32,629
[SPEAKER_18]: and whether or not, you know, how Medford should approach it and whether or not we should, you know, have our schools participate also.

834
01:12:34,650 --> 01:12:34,931
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

835
01:12:35,231 --> 01:12:35,451
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

836
01:12:35,471 --> 01:12:40,133
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just going to refer you back to the vice-chairman of the commission for their review and they will get back to us.

837
01:12:42,714 --> 01:12:45,776
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

838
01:12:45,796 --> 01:12:47,577
[SPEAKER_03]: 14-701 offered by Councilor Penta.

839
01:12:50,518 --> 01:12:51,318
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion for approval.

840
01:12:51,338 --> 01:12:52,619
[SPEAKER_03]: All in favor?

841
01:12:53,319 --> 01:12:53,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Opposed?

842
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:54,600
[SPEAKER_03]: None.

843
01:12:55,295 --> 01:13:01,238
[SPEAKER_03]: Six in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

844
01:13:01,258 --> 01:13:16,266
[SPEAKER_03]: 14701, offered by Councilor Penter, be it resolved that the Medford City Council take an official position on Mayor McGlynn's one-size-fits-all pay-to-park contract, since, in fact, the council found out about the signing by a press release.

845
01:13:18,007 --> 01:13:18,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Penter.

846
01:13:18,988 --> 01:13:22,670
[SPEAKER_20]: President, since last Tuesday night until now,

847
01:13:25,577 --> 01:13:27,218
[SPEAKER_20]: I think we've all, I'll speak for myself.

848
01:13:27,538 --> 01:13:34,760
[SPEAKER_20]: I received a considerable amount of phone calls from not only Method business folks on two particular issues, this and the raising and the water rates.

849
01:13:35,221 --> 01:13:36,721
[SPEAKER_20]: But we'll stick to this issue right now.

850
01:13:37,481 --> 01:13:47,605
[SPEAKER_20]: And the unfortunate part about it is what we heard last Tuesday night, part of the issue is not whether you're now for it or against it.

851
01:13:47,645 --> 01:13:54,948
[SPEAKER_20]: The issue now revolves itself around the fact that the mayor had made a promise that he was going to have a public hearing on this particular matter.

852
01:13:55,687 --> 01:14:03,168
[SPEAKER_20]: um, resolution 14, six 45, which was offered by myself and subsequently amended by council Lungo passed.

853
01:14:04,128 --> 01:14:24,272
[SPEAKER_20]: Uh, and that was some two weeks ago, I think it was in September 23rd and asking the mayor to have a public meeting and a hearing throughout this community, whether it be here at city hall or wherever, wherever it's so big that citizens and, and, um, business folks would have an opportunity to come and express their opinion, whether they were forward against it or more importantly,

854
01:14:24,645 --> 01:14:26,186
[SPEAKER_20]: as to what the mayor's proposal was.

855
01:14:26,867 --> 01:14:41,017
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think after we knew last Tuesday night coming into our council meeting that at five o'clock the mayor had sent out a press release indicating that he had signed the contract, I think that sort of like took us all off guard, especially to the point that no public meeting ever took place.

856
01:14:41,878 --> 01:14:54,307
[SPEAKER_20]: Then more importantly, or as importantly, last week the president of the chamber came down here and indicated that the chamber had taken an official position for the purposes of supporting

857
01:14:55,250 --> 01:14:57,691
[SPEAKER_20]: The contract for what information Councilor Dello Russo.

858
01:14:57,871 --> 01:15:03,774
[SPEAKER_05]: Did the mayor say that he was having a, if I could through the chair, did the mayor say that he was having a public meeting on this?

859
01:15:04,134 --> 01:15:06,175
[SPEAKER_03]: I have not heard of any public meeting Councilor Dello Russo.

860
01:15:06,815 --> 01:15:20,561
[SPEAKER_20]: The question becomes relevant because the concerns that were expressed at the meeting of the 10th of September and all seven members of the council had concerns as it related to, uh, what might or what might not be in the contract.

861
01:15:21,041 --> 01:15:22,762
[SPEAKER_20]: And in fact, we as a council,

862
01:15:23,292 --> 01:15:29,216
[SPEAKER_20]: We as a council had never been advised or never even shown what the finality of the contract was.

863
01:15:29,836 --> 01:15:41,964
[SPEAKER_20]: But after listening to the president of the chamber, he particularly was involved with the mayor, and the mayor allowed him to be involved in making the final decisions or agreeing to the concessions of the final decisions.

864
01:15:42,724 --> 01:15:43,805
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, that's all well and good.

865
01:15:44,666 --> 01:15:46,887
[SPEAKER_20]: But the Chamber of Commerce is not the Medford City Council.

866
01:15:47,788 --> 01:15:51,210
[SPEAKER_20]: And the Medford City Council was owed that due respect from the mayor

867
01:15:52,032 --> 01:15:58,194
[SPEAKER_20]: that the finality of signing that contract, or before it was to take place, should have come before the council.

868
01:15:58,714 --> 01:16:01,075
[SPEAKER_20]: We all discussed it, and we all had an opinion on it.

869
01:16:01,655 --> 01:16:04,336
[SPEAKER_20]: Whether you were for it or against it, that wasn't the issue.

870
01:16:04,636 --> 01:16:07,897
[SPEAKER_20]: The fact of the matter was to have the public hearing or the public meeting.

871
01:16:08,237 --> 01:16:09,038
[SPEAKER_20]: Call it what you may.

872
01:16:09,258 --> 01:16:17,760
[SPEAKER_20]: Let taxpayers, let residents, and business owners come up and have an opportunity to speak on something that they didn't even know what was going on, that they were just finding out about.

873
01:16:21,636 --> 01:16:28,620
[SPEAKER_20]: The president of the chamber indicated when the question was asked that he only represents members of the chamber.

874
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:30,622
[SPEAKER_20]: He doesn't represent any other business people.

875
01:16:31,262 --> 01:16:37,606
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, I think that's an injustice to every other business person in this community who's a taxpayer and has employees.

876
01:16:38,206 --> 01:16:43,069
[SPEAKER_20]: There are people that maybe don't want to become members of the chamber or just don't have the time to become members of the chamber.

877
01:16:43,510 --> 01:16:47,012
[SPEAKER_20]: And they should not be looked upon as a second grade or a second class citizen.

878
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:51,621
[SPEAKER_20]: for the purposes of whether you agree or disagree with a pay-to-park program.

879
01:16:51,721 --> 01:16:53,321
[SPEAKER_20]: One information, Councilor De La Russa.

880
01:16:54,402 --> 01:17:12,066
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't recall the President of the Chamber ever indicating that he had any particular or exclusive consultative role in this process any more than anybody else who may or may not have, who has made that role public or private.

881
01:17:12,526 --> 01:17:16,007
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. President, I think if you review the tape, the tape is as clear as can be.

882
01:17:16,525 --> 01:17:25,029
[SPEAKER_20]: that Mr. White indicated that subsequent to the 10th meeting of September, he asked the mayor to be a part of what the concerns were of the chamber.

883
01:17:25,689 --> 01:17:28,090
[SPEAKER_20]: And as a result of that, he met with the chamber.

884
01:17:28,190 --> 01:17:31,292
[SPEAKER_20]: And as a matter of fact, he said he was satisfied with the concessions.

885
01:17:31,892 --> 01:17:41,156
[SPEAKER_20]: But it was the same person who, quote, in the paper, indicated that all business districts in this community are unique until they have their own special problems.

886
01:17:41,777 --> 01:17:44,718
[SPEAKER_20]: And by having your own special problems, which they need to be discussed,

887
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:45,820
[SPEAKER_20]: and be reviewed.

888
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:48,601
[SPEAKER_20]: And that was on the 2nd of October.

889
01:17:49,542 --> 01:17:53,263
[SPEAKER_20]: Five days after that, the 7th of October, the mayor signs the contract.

890
01:17:53,903 --> 01:17:54,663
[SPEAKER_20]: That's kind of quick.

891
01:17:55,424 --> 01:17:58,885
[SPEAKER_20]: None of these people from the other sections of the city were involved.

892
01:17:59,145 --> 01:17:59,945
[SPEAKER_20]: No business people.

893
01:18:00,225 --> 01:18:04,026
[SPEAKER_20]: And once again, no taxpayers, no rate payers in this community.

894
01:18:04,527 --> 01:18:05,447
[SPEAKER_20]: And with that happening,

895
01:18:06,370 --> 01:18:09,852
[SPEAKER_20]: It makes you subject to the question of the Chamber of Commerce.

896
01:18:09,872 --> 01:18:12,413
[SPEAKER_20]: They don't know whether they have 200 or 300 members.

897
01:18:12,873 --> 01:18:13,774
[SPEAKER_20]: So whatever it might be.

898
01:18:14,154 --> 01:18:20,697
[SPEAKER_20]: And if it's 200 members and only a specific board, the Governmental Affairs Committee voted, what they voted for, I don't know.

899
01:18:21,137 --> 01:18:22,638
[SPEAKER_20]: The Chamber of Commerce, I don't know.

900
01:18:22,858 --> 01:18:34,324
[SPEAKER_06]: This discourse seems to exclude the possibility that the mayor consulted with shop owners throughout the city who may or may not have been in membership of the Chamber of Commerce.

901
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:45,150
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, Mr. President, since Councilor Dello Russo and you, Councilor Caraviello, are both members of the chamber, I would see that you have a prejudice here to support the chamber's position, no matter what this one councilor has to say.

902
01:18:45,170 --> 01:18:45,770
[SPEAKER_21]: I have no prejudice.

903
01:18:46,050 --> 01:18:46,390
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

904
01:18:46,550 --> 01:18:49,071
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, since you have no prejudice, maybe Councilor Dello Russo does.

905
01:18:49,131 --> 01:18:53,192
[SPEAKER_20]: But, you know, we also asked for what was going to be included and what was going to be excluded.

906
01:18:53,292 --> 01:18:54,773
[SPEAKER_06]: One other question, Councilor Dello Russo.

907
01:18:55,073 --> 01:19:00,314
[SPEAKER_06]: I may or may not have prejudice in this matter, but I haven't indicated that publicly.

908
01:19:01,195 --> 01:19:02,795
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, he hasn't indicated it publicly, so.

909
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:05,080
[SPEAKER_20]: That leaves a suspect right there.

910
01:19:05,681 --> 01:19:16,564
[SPEAKER_20]: And I believe it was the president of the chamber who indicated that he was happy to have been part of the process meeting with the mayor and coming to this concession through resolutions for whatever it might have been.

911
01:19:16,804 --> 01:19:21,165
[SPEAKER_20]: This council was never apprised of any of whatever a concession might be.

912
01:19:21,705 --> 01:19:28,287
[SPEAKER_20]: This one size fits all for all five districts, which includes Medford Square, it just doesn't work.

913
01:19:28,627 --> 01:19:29,727
[SPEAKER_20]: It doesn't cut the mustard.

914
01:19:30,888 --> 01:19:31,728
[SPEAKER_20]: And more importantly,

915
01:19:33,033 --> 01:19:34,093
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a recommendation.

916
01:19:34,494 --> 01:19:42,797
[SPEAKER_20]: If you look at the press release that the mayor said, now I asked the city clerk today, um, I had called earlier and still I don't have it.

917
01:19:42,837 --> 01:19:46,179
[SPEAKER_20]: Does anyone behind this rail have a copy of the contract either on disk?

918
01:19:46,399 --> 01:19:52,821
[SPEAKER_03]: It was delivered to you moments ago by, Oh, moments ago, moments ago by the messenger.

919
01:19:53,081 --> 01:19:53,902
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, by the messenger.

920
01:19:54,202 --> 01:19:54,982
[SPEAKER_20]: That's really nice.

921
01:19:55,062 --> 01:19:55,623
[SPEAKER_20]: Moments ago.

922
01:19:55,683 --> 01:19:56,743
[SPEAKER_20]: Here we have, we asked for it.

923
01:19:57,040 --> 01:20:01,463
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, here we have an $18 million, 10-year contract, and we just get the information now.

924
01:20:01,824 --> 01:20:04,306
[SPEAKER_20]: But the chamber was aware of it, and they agreed to it.

925
01:20:04,646 --> 01:20:08,089
[SPEAKER_20]: And I really have a suspect that I don't think the chamber was in agreement.

926
01:20:08,589 --> 01:20:17,296
[SPEAKER_20]: I think if you took a poll of their membership and had a discussion of what's going on on those four priority sections, you'd have a better idea as to what their feelings might be.

927
01:20:17,816 --> 01:20:25,422
[SPEAKER_20]: And maybe Councilor Dello Russo was right, because when the mayor two Saturdays ago took a walk in the Westmethod area, I don't think he liked the response that he got, whether it was a

928
01:20:25,828 --> 01:20:27,149
[SPEAKER_20]: business person of the chamber.

929
01:20:27,229 --> 01:20:28,609
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not a business person of the chamber.

930
01:20:29,390 --> 01:20:31,671
[SPEAKER_20]: This is business in this community.

931
01:20:32,071 --> 01:20:35,933
[SPEAKER_20]: People are putting their daily work on their line.

932
01:20:36,946 --> 01:20:46,016
[SPEAKER_20]: They're not worried about the chamber being supportive of them, they need to make money, they have to pay their employees, they need to pay their insurance, they need to pay everything that makes a business work.

933
01:20:46,456 --> 01:20:53,383
[SPEAKER_20]: Not every single person in this community or every single business in this community is a member of the chamber, and rightfully so.

934
01:20:53,504 --> 01:20:56,747
[SPEAKER_20]: They don't have to be and they shouldn't be if they so choose not to be.

935
01:20:57,848 --> 01:21:18,824
[SPEAKER_20]: So why the mayor decides to pick on this one organization as to be the only organization to make his recommendations and his concessions with, I don't know, but he should have been before this Medford City Council and the taxpayers of this community to give his final decision of whatever he thought he was going to do by way of having a public hearing to get some input.

936
01:21:19,745 --> 01:21:26,690
[SPEAKER_20]: On May 20th of this past year, we voted to give the mayor the opportunity to deal with a single-person contract

937
01:21:27,459 --> 01:21:31,441
[SPEAKER_20]: for 10 years, because the law says anything over three years, you have to take a vote.

938
01:21:31,821 --> 01:21:33,002
[SPEAKER_20]: We didn't tell him to sign it.

939
01:21:33,422 --> 01:21:36,224
[SPEAKER_20]: What we said is to go and make your contract negotiations.

940
01:21:36,524 --> 01:21:37,805
[SPEAKER_20]: Come back before the council.

941
01:21:38,305 --> 01:21:40,286
[SPEAKER_20]: Come back before the council and tell us what you have.

942
01:21:40,867 --> 01:21:42,728
[SPEAKER_20]: The law says the council makes the vote.

943
01:21:43,328 --> 01:21:48,591
[SPEAKER_20]: The council will only vote if him to go and to engage in a contract, not to sign the contract.

944
01:21:49,282 --> 01:21:52,224
[SPEAKER_20]: If that be the case, then what was the purpose of us even being here?

945
01:21:52,524 --> 01:21:53,705
[SPEAKER_20]: We shouldn't even be discussing this.

946
01:21:54,025 --> 01:21:54,966
[SPEAKER_20]: It means absolutely nothing.

947
01:21:55,386 --> 01:21:57,628
[SPEAKER_20]: He shouldn't have even had the meeting on September 10th.

948
01:21:58,648 --> 01:21:59,409
[SPEAKER_20]: This is all for nothing.

949
01:22:00,189 --> 01:22:03,892
[SPEAKER_20]: But his back got against the wall because he heard from some of the business people.

950
01:22:04,512 --> 01:22:07,454
[SPEAKER_20]: And unfortunately, once again, the president of the chamber said,

951
01:22:07,777 --> 01:22:10,139
[SPEAKER_20]: Most of the people in the room that night weren't even chamber members.

952
01:22:10,779 --> 01:22:11,760
[SPEAKER_20]: So what does that mean?

953
01:22:11,820 --> 01:22:13,741
[SPEAKER_20]: Just because they're not chamber members.

954
01:22:14,202 --> 01:22:24,049
[SPEAKER_20]: They're business people in this community who pay their taxes and employ people and have residents come to their stores and buy their products so they can have a living and make a living.

955
01:22:25,570 --> 01:22:27,652
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. President, you're a member of the chamber.

956
01:22:27,672 --> 01:22:31,094
[SPEAKER_20]: You and I have had this discussion numerous times on numerous occasions.

957
01:22:31,474 --> 01:22:32,295
[SPEAKER_20]: And as you've been aware,

958
01:22:33,481 --> 01:22:34,022
[SPEAKER_20]: many people.

959
01:22:34,082 --> 01:22:38,068
[SPEAKER_20]: You told me you went to, you told me you went to the groundbreaking ceremonies, the bank over there.

960
01:22:38,628 --> 01:22:38,929
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

961
01:22:39,410 --> 01:22:40,050
[SPEAKER_20]: Last Saturday.

962
01:22:40,351 --> 01:22:44,276
[SPEAKER_20]: You told me the mayor had to run away because everybody was on top of them because of the parking thing.

963
01:22:44,657 --> 01:22:46,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Not at the bank on Saturday, on Friday.

964
01:22:46,279 --> 01:22:47,761
[SPEAKER_20]: Friday, excuse me, on Friday.

965
01:22:47,781 --> 01:22:50,625
[SPEAKER_03]: There was nobody there complaining about parking that day.

966
01:22:52,256 --> 01:22:52,736
[SPEAKER_03]: when I was there.

967
01:22:52,796 --> 01:22:53,557
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, I was there.

968
01:22:53,617 --> 01:22:56,098
[SPEAKER_20]: You were there after the fact because you know, I was, I was there for the opening.

969
01:22:56,138 --> 01:22:57,558
[SPEAKER_03]: And what did you tell me?

970
01:22:57,879 --> 01:22:58,379
[SPEAKER_03]: What'd you tell me?

971
01:22:58,399 --> 01:23:00,820
[SPEAKER_20]: He had to leave because everybody was complaining about that.

972
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:01,620
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something else.

973
01:23:01,640 --> 01:23:01,800
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

974
01:23:01,940 --> 01:23:02,601
[SPEAKER_20]: That's something else.

975
01:23:02,661 --> 01:23:03,361
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, same thing.

976
01:23:03,601 --> 01:23:04,922
[SPEAKER_20]: You go to so many of these inaugurals.

977
01:23:04,962 --> 01:23:11,325
[SPEAKER_20]: I have no idea which ones that we were at, but the fact of the matter is this, um, I just think it's unfair.

978
01:23:11,825 --> 01:23:18,148
[SPEAKER_20]: And I, and I really don't know because if the press release is only nothing more than recommendations,

979
01:23:19,185 --> 01:23:22,447
[SPEAKER_20]: then they don't have to adhere to anything, this company called Republic.

980
01:23:23,348 --> 01:23:28,191
[SPEAKER_20]: And the aggressiveness, as Councilor Marks alluded to last week, they're going to start at 7 in the morning to 7 at night.

981
01:23:28,211 --> 01:23:31,493
[SPEAKER_20]: They need to do a million, $2 million a year as a minimum to start.

982
01:23:31,513 --> 01:23:34,675
[SPEAKER_20]: You know yourself as well as I. They're going to be out there writing tickets.

983
01:23:35,095 --> 01:23:41,259
[SPEAKER_20]: But the cream, the cream to this whole deal is that the mayor retains the appeal process.

984
01:23:41,839 --> 01:23:48,403
[SPEAKER_20]: And to me, that is political because if it wasn't going to be political and it was going to be independent, he should have given it up.

985
01:23:48,841 --> 01:23:55,165
[SPEAKER_20]: So City Hall still remains as the political process of appeal to this whole particular program.

986
01:23:55,646 --> 01:24:04,712
[SPEAKER_20]: And as what took place today at the Traffic Commission, they indicated, you know, they will still have the authority to set the places and set the rates.

987
01:24:05,012 --> 01:24:10,216
[SPEAKER_20]: But we still don't know the exact spots of where things are going, and we don't really know who's going to be excluded.

988
01:24:10,556 --> 01:24:16,600
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I would assume that it is in this disc that we received this evening that, for our review,

989
01:24:17,533 --> 01:24:19,994
[SPEAKER_03]: over the next week for our next meeting.

990
01:24:20,794 --> 01:24:21,594
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, I'm just.

991
01:24:25,155 --> 01:24:33,618
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, how do you, how does any one councilor justify the fact that a contract was signed and you never even saw it?

992
01:24:34,238 --> 01:24:37,759
[SPEAKER_20]: You voted for something that you asked the mayor to do, and he didn't do it.

993
01:24:37,779 --> 01:24:40,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Point of clarification.

994
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:42,421
[SPEAKER_13]: Point of clarification, Councilor Van Gogh-Carran.

995
01:24:42,541 --> 01:24:43,721
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

996
01:24:44,141 --> 01:24:45,622
[SPEAKER_13]: As far as I'm concerned, we had

997
01:24:47,104 --> 01:24:54,328
[SPEAKER_13]: I've mentioned this before, two, possibly three meetings with the mayor, in subcommittee, with Director Burke.

998
01:24:54,888 --> 01:24:59,931
[SPEAKER_13]: And we went over, I mean, we had hours of discussion of the terms that would be in the contract.

999
01:25:00,011 --> 01:25:02,032
[SPEAKER_13]: We knew how much they were going to charge per hour.

1000
01:25:02,513 --> 01:25:05,014
[SPEAKER_13]: We knew how many spots were going to be monitored.

1001
01:25:05,074 --> 01:25:15,840
[SPEAKER_13]: We knew, we were in executive session discussing the three possible people that we were going to sign, engage in contract negotiations with.

1002
01:25:16,660 --> 01:25:22,482
[SPEAKER_13]: After those three meetings, this city council, seven of us, voted to allow the mayor to negotiate.

1003
01:25:23,002 --> 01:25:29,524
[SPEAKER_13]: So I mean, I just want to make that clear because I feel like this is something that I've pretty much already have seen.

1004
01:25:29,804 --> 01:25:31,665
[SPEAKER_13]: We were getting it first, maybe the third time.

1005
01:25:32,345 --> 01:25:34,946
[SPEAKER_20]: But point of further clarification, you hit it right in the head.

1006
01:25:35,286 --> 01:25:38,307
[SPEAKER_20]: You gave him the authority to negotiate, but not to sign the contract.

1007
01:25:38,567 --> 01:25:39,267
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's what he did.

1008
01:25:39,487 --> 01:25:44,149
[SPEAKER_20]: He signed the contract without any one of us having an opportunity to see it and discuss it.

1009
01:25:44,465 --> 01:25:46,266
[SPEAKER_06]: Point of information, Councilor Dela Russa.

1010
01:25:46,827 --> 01:25:50,670
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder out loud, do we have to authorize him to sign a contract?

1011
01:25:50,730 --> 01:25:52,251
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought he was the contracting authority.

1012
01:25:52,291 --> 01:25:53,092
[SPEAKER_03]: The solicitor is not here.

1013
01:25:53,132 --> 01:25:54,213
[SPEAKER_03]: I cannot answer that question.

1014
01:25:56,114 --> 01:25:57,155
[SPEAKER_03]: Point of further information, Mr. President.

1015
01:25:57,996 --> 01:25:59,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Point of information, Councilor Mayne.

1016
01:25:59,497 --> 01:26:13,728
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe when we were at the meeting in executive session with the mayor and we granted him the authority to enter into this contract for a term of 10 years, that we did not put any criteria upon the mayor's ability to negotiate this contract in terms of having a councillor present as a member of his negotiating team.

1017
01:26:14,098 --> 01:26:18,663
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's very important to keep in mind that we want the mayor to go into this and negotiate a contract in good faith.

1018
01:26:19,163 --> 01:26:24,589
[SPEAKER_07]: And the mayor can't go and negotiate a contract in good faith if he can't bring that back to the board and have confidence that it's going to be passed.

1019
01:26:25,149 --> 01:26:28,993
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we gave him the opportunity to go out there and we gave him an opportunity to enter into a 10-year contract.

1020
01:26:29,153 --> 01:26:34,879
[SPEAKER_07]: As Councilor Lungo-Koehn has said a number of times, and her sentiment is something that I have echoed, we knew what we were getting into.

1021
01:26:34,899 --> 01:26:35,700
[SPEAKER_07]: We saw the RFP.

1022
01:26:36,255 --> 01:26:37,056
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilman Marks is right.

1023
01:26:37,216 --> 01:26:38,537
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the mayor's parking plan.

1024
01:26:38,577 --> 01:26:39,517
[SPEAKER_07]: The mayor put this together.

1025
01:26:39,557 --> 01:26:40,418
[SPEAKER_07]: The mayor negotiated.

1026
01:26:40,458 --> 01:26:42,339
[SPEAKER_07]: The criteria come right out of the corner office.

1027
01:26:42,599 --> 01:26:43,640
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't come from this council.

1028
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:47,843
[SPEAKER_07]: The authority that we gave him was to enter into the agreement solely.

1029
01:26:48,163 --> 01:26:50,765
[SPEAKER_07]: But when we were in the executive session, we saw what the plan was.

1030
01:26:51,505 --> 01:26:52,446
[SPEAKER_07]: We saw what the plan was.

1031
01:26:52,486 --> 01:26:53,707
[SPEAKER_07]: We knew what it was going to entail.

1032
01:26:54,067 --> 01:26:54,988
[SPEAKER_07]: We weren't allowed to talk about it.

1033
01:26:55,008 --> 01:26:55,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Point of clarification.

1034
01:26:55,788 --> 01:26:56,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Point of clarification.

1035
01:26:57,029 --> 01:26:58,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Point of clarification, Councilman Pentland.

1036
01:26:58,330 --> 01:27:01,912
[SPEAKER_20]: We were never given a contract to look at an executive session.

1037
01:27:02,213 --> 01:27:05,475
[SPEAKER_20]: The only thing we had an executive session, which was only once, that was May 20.

1038
01:27:06,140 --> 01:27:08,481
[SPEAKER_20]: and that was to pick the Republic from Tennessee.

1039
01:27:09,181 --> 01:27:19,963
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, we told them to go ahead and negotiate a contract, but we didn't tell them to sign it because if you read the minutes and you look at the tape, it turns around and you have to come back to the council for the vote to accept it.

1040
01:27:20,363 --> 01:27:22,724
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, I'd be interested to see the tape of executive session.

1041
01:27:23,244 --> 01:27:23,884
[SPEAKER_20]: They don't make one.

1042
01:27:24,024 --> 01:27:24,624
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't have one.

1043
01:27:24,644 --> 01:27:24,804
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1044
01:27:27,185 --> 01:27:28,065
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor De La Ruza.

1045
01:27:29,065 --> 01:27:35,987
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm under the impression that this council unanimously in the past endorsed a course of action

1046
01:27:36,434 --> 01:27:40,759
[SPEAKER_06]: regarding a style of enforcement to be undertaken by the mayor.

1047
01:27:40,779 --> 01:27:42,141
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you are correct.

1048
01:27:42,641 --> 01:27:44,083
[SPEAKER_20]: Say that again, Councilor De La Rosa.

1049
01:27:44,223 --> 01:27:44,524
[SPEAKER_20]: To what?

1050
01:27:44,684 --> 01:27:45,345
[SPEAKER_20]: Style what?

1051
01:27:45,385 --> 01:27:52,733
[SPEAKER_06]: This council unanimously endorsed a style of enforcement to be undertaken by the mayor.

1052
01:27:52,753 --> 01:27:54,736
[SPEAKER_20]: What do you mean, style enforcement?

1053
01:27:54,776 --> 01:27:55,076
[SPEAKER_20]: What's that?

1054
01:27:55,590 --> 01:28:11,983
[SPEAKER_06]: a style of enforcement, a means of enforcement that we specified for him to undertake, i.e., that the mayor begin by hiring employees to enforce the existing parking laws.

1055
01:28:12,483 --> 01:28:14,265
[SPEAKER_20]: Enforcement is not the same as pay-to-park.

1056
01:28:14,485 --> 01:28:16,486
[SPEAKER_20]: It's two entirely different subject matters.

1057
01:28:16,927 --> 01:28:18,748
[SPEAKER_20]: The mayor decided to make it even more.

1058
01:28:18,988 --> 01:28:20,369
[SPEAKER_20]: This council was looking for enforcement.

1059
01:28:20,389 --> 01:28:21,891
[SPEAKER_06]: This is about enforcement, Mr. President.

1060
01:28:21,931 --> 01:28:22,951
[SPEAKER_06]: No, this is about pay-to-park.

1061
01:28:23,012 --> 01:28:24,833
[SPEAKER_06]: This is about enforcement.

1062
01:28:25,092 --> 01:28:26,113
[SPEAKER_20]: It's about paying to park.

1063
01:28:27,074 --> 01:28:30,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I, I've had a brief conversation with him.

1064
01:28:30,056 --> 01:28:42,528
[SPEAKER_03]: I know there has been some changes made from, uh, the last time as far as if there's going to be some meters and some areas and there's going to be some, uh, designated 30 minute spots, uh, different areas.

1065
01:28:42,628 --> 01:28:44,149
[SPEAKER_20]: That's what he said in his press release.

1066
01:28:44,269 --> 01:28:44,449
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

1067
01:28:44,469 --> 01:28:45,150
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know.

1068
01:28:45,170 --> 01:28:46,611
[SPEAKER_03]: He said those are only recommendations.

1069
01:28:47,312 --> 01:28:49,694
[SPEAKER_03]: I was told that that's where the, you know, again, um,

1070
01:28:51,140 --> 01:28:52,261
[SPEAKER_03]: Council on my point of information.

1071
01:28:52,501 --> 01:29:04,366
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe that because the city retains the right to determine where these kiosks, meters, and free spots are going to go, that the recommendation would go to the Traffic and Off-Street Parking Commission and then they would be the ones who would be implementing this because they retain jurisdiction.

1072
01:29:04,386 --> 01:29:07,548
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not giving up any of the sidewalks or any of our streets.

1073
01:29:07,568 --> 01:29:09,208
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think any of us have seen anything.

1074
01:29:09,649 --> 01:29:14,371
[SPEAKER_03]: I would hope that on this disc, when we get home tonight, we'll look at it and see what's

1075
01:29:15,332 --> 01:29:17,614
[SPEAKER_03]: what's on there, so that's the best I can give you.

1076
01:29:17,934 --> 01:29:22,257
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to table until we've had opportunity to review the information before us.

1077
01:29:22,277 --> 01:29:23,818
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to table by Councilor Dello Russo.

1078
01:29:23,838 --> 01:29:25,519
[SPEAKER_03]: All in favor?

1079
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:26,160
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

1080
01:29:26,280 --> 01:29:27,821
[SPEAKER_03]: Opposed?

1081
01:29:29,062 --> 01:29:29,282
[SPEAKER_03]: None.

1082
01:29:29,963 --> 01:29:30,663
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion is tabled.

1083
01:29:30,683 --> 01:29:30,703
[SPEAKER_03]: 6-0.

1084
01:29:32,384 --> 01:29:40,851
[SPEAKER_20]: This, this, this says parking proposal.

1085
01:29:40,871 --> 01:29:41,831
[SPEAKER_20]: It doesn't say parking.

1086
01:29:43,232 --> 01:29:44,093
[SPEAKER_03]: I, again, I don't,

1087
01:29:45,089 --> 01:29:46,270
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what it says.

1088
01:29:48,091 --> 01:29:51,574
[SPEAKER_03]: It says technical and pricing.

1089
01:29:51,614 --> 01:29:56,337
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would hope that maybe the, again, I can't speak with what's on here because I don't know.

1090
01:29:56,357 --> 01:29:59,579
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be speaking out of turn if I did say that.

1091
01:30:01,821 --> 01:30:03,562
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was a copy of the contract here also.

1092
01:30:03,622 --> 01:30:04,763
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know what's on the desk.

1093
01:30:05,624 --> 01:30:07,485
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what we received from the messenger this evening.

1094
01:30:07,505 --> 01:30:11,127
[SPEAKER_03]: You have one right on your desk there, Councilor Pence.

1095
01:30:12,008 --> 01:30:14,670
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to read it over the week and we'll bring it up next week,

1096
01:30:16,274 --> 01:30:20,295
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what's on the table for this week.

1097
01:30:21,136 --> 01:30:22,256
[SPEAKER_03]: 14702, offered by Councilor Knight.

1098
01:30:23,036 --> 01:30:31,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Be it resolved, Tufts University provide the Medford City Council with its policy governing the handling of on-campus sexual assaults.

1099
01:30:31,779 --> 01:30:32,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight.

1100
01:30:34,300 --> 01:30:35,621
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1101
01:30:36,721 --> 01:30:45,504
[SPEAKER_07]: If anybody's been paying attention to the recent debates relative to the Attorney General's race, a hot topic that's been coming up over and over again is sexual assaults on college campuses.

1102
01:30:46,327 --> 01:30:48,488
[SPEAKER_07]: And that prompted me to do a little bit of investigation.

1103
01:30:49,128 --> 01:30:56,091
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've come across a number of articles, two of which I provided my council colleagues with, as well as one for the city clerk.

1104
01:30:56,671 --> 01:31:01,973
[SPEAKER_07]: But in the Business Insider, I did take a look at a study.

1105
01:31:02,854 --> 01:31:07,535
[SPEAKER_07]: And the study was authored by Peter Jacobs, June 4, 2014.

1106
01:31:07,635 --> 01:31:09,116
[SPEAKER_07]: It was published in Business Insider.

1107
01:31:09,156 --> 01:31:11,617
[SPEAKER_07]: Here are the staggering numbers behind college sexual assault crisis.

1108
01:31:13,328 --> 01:31:16,349
[SPEAKER_07]: More than 99% of sexual assault perpetrators are male.

1109
01:31:16,949 --> 01:31:20,189
[SPEAKER_07]: Females account for around 95% of the sexual assault victims.

1110
01:31:21,410 --> 01:31:27,731
[SPEAKER_07]: Nearly 80% of the perpetrators are the same race of their victim, and around 90% of the victims know their perpetrator.

1111
01:31:28,431 --> 01:31:33,612
[SPEAKER_07]: Freshmen and sophomores in colleges are the most likely to be a victim of sexual assaults.

1112
01:31:33,892 --> 01:31:38,713
[SPEAKER_07]: 50% of the sexual assaults happen on Friday or Saturday, the majority of which happen between midnight and 6 AM.

1113
01:31:40,396 --> 01:31:43,417
[SPEAKER_07]: including almost 90% of the assaults when a victim is incapacitated.

1114
01:31:44,777 --> 01:31:49,338
[SPEAKER_07]: More than 40% of college sexual assaults happen in either September or October when there's an influx of new students.

1115
01:31:50,839 --> 01:31:55,500
[SPEAKER_07]: Around 80% of college sexual assaults happen either in the victim's or perpetrator's living quarters.

1116
01:31:56,720 --> 01:32:03,762
[SPEAKER_07]: In a 10-year study of college sexual assault in Massachusetts found that 81% of campus rapes and sexual assaults occurred in an on-campus dormitory.

1117
01:32:04,602 --> 01:32:07,243
[SPEAKER_07]: So these numbers were staggering, Mr. President, and when I read them,

1118
01:32:09,036 --> 01:32:12,479
[SPEAKER_07]: made me want to Google Tufts University and sexual assault on campus.

1119
01:32:12,679 --> 01:32:21,225
[SPEAKER_07]: And what happened was a very troubling article that I came across saying that the US Department of Education and Tufts University are at odds on the way that they're handling sexual assaults.

1120
01:32:22,146 --> 01:32:37,337
[SPEAKER_07]: Marcella Bombardieri, Globe staff from the Boston Globe, published an article on April 29, 2014 that spoke about some of the issues that Tufts University was having with the Department of Education relative to federal funding because of the way they handled the reported on-campus sexual assault.

1121
01:32:37,768 --> 01:32:45,290
[SPEAKER_07]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I think we've all sat up here and said time and time again that our most important job in this community is to keep our residents safe.

1122
01:32:46,010 --> 01:32:57,873
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to see the updated policy regarding the reporting of on-campus sexual assaults from Tufts University for the opportunity to review it, but also to send it to our chief of police and send it to the Middlesex County District Attorney for their review and recommendation.

1123
01:32:58,393 --> 01:32:59,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1124
01:33:01,034 --> 01:33:02,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight's motion.

1125
01:33:02,574 --> 01:33:03,455
[SPEAKER_03]: All in favor?

1126
01:33:03,895 --> 01:33:03,995
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

1127
01:33:04,315 --> 01:33:04,775

[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes 6-0.

1129

01:34:20,448 --> 01:34:20,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Opposed?

1145
01:34:21,849 --> 01:34:23,130

[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Marks.

1152
01:34:52,633 --> 01:34:56,274
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, again, all the papers appear to be in order.

1153
01:34:57,315 --> 01:35:01,457
[SPEAKER_09]: If the gentleman just could give us his hours of operation.

1154

[SPEAKER_01]: Name and address on the record, please.

[SPEAKER_01]: 7 a.m.

01:35:25,161 --> 01:35:25,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, sir.

1163
01:35:25,742 --> 01:35:27,603
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, sir.

1164
01:35:27,623 --> 01:35:28,404
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Dello Russo.

1165
01:35:28,784 --> 01:35:30,566
[SPEAKER_06]: How many convenience stores do you operate, sir?

1166
01:35:31,071 --> 01:35:33,013
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the one, this is the first one.

1167
01:35:33,593 --> 01:35:40,419
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do have experience because last couple of years I worked for CVS, so I do have some customer service experience before.

1168
01:35:42,101 --> 01:35:42,361
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1169
01:35:42,441 --> 01:35:43,722
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1170
01:35:43,762 --> 01:35:44,283
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, sir.

1171
01:35:44,623 --> 01:35:45,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion for approval.

1172
01:35:45,404 --> 01:35:46,805
[SPEAKER_03]: All in favor?

1173
01:35:46,825 --> 01:35:47,966
[SPEAKER_03]: Opposed?

1174
01:35:48,527 --> 01:35:49,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes 6-0.

1175
01:35:49,708 --> 01:35:50,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address for the record.

1176
01:35:51,009 --> 01:35:53,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Jim Costello, 160 Brook Street, Medford.

1177
01:35:54,092 --> 01:35:57,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Flynn, does he come down tomorrow morning to the clerk's office to get a certificate?

1178
01:36:03,460 --> 01:36:08,041
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll either mail it to him or if he wants to come in Thursday, something like that.

1179
01:36:08,061 --> 01:36:08,901
[SPEAKER_02]: He won't be ready tomorrow.

1180
01:36:08,981 --> 01:36:10,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Thursday would be helpful if he came in.

1181
01:36:10,941 --> 01:36:12,722
[SPEAKER_04]: And one more question, if I could.

1182
01:36:12,742 --> 01:36:16,122
[SPEAKER_04]: He's applied for three permits from the Board of Health.

1183
01:36:16,882 --> 01:36:23,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Now for milk, cigarettes, and coffee.

1184
01:36:23,703 --> 01:36:26,344
[SPEAKER_04]: How does he go about getting those permits?

1185
01:36:26,504 --> 01:36:30,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, number one, you have to go and apply to the Board of Health.

1186
01:36:30,185 --> 01:36:30,925
[SPEAKER_02]: He has done that.

1187
01:36:31,025 --> 01:36:32,785
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the Board of Health should be

1188
01:36:33,762 --> 01:36:34,623
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty much granting it.

1189
01:36:34,923 --> 01:36:41,648
[SPEAKER_02]: I would think that if they signed off on this here, I would think that they must be ready, those others.

1190
01:36:41,668 --> 01:36:42,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, okay.

1191
01:36:42,588 --> 01:36:46,391
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, does he go there and get them, or does he- So I'd go up there and- Thursday too?

1192
01:36:46,511 --> 01:36:46,671
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1193
01:36:46,911 --> 01:36:51,334
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, thank you for your help.

1194
01:36:53,476 --> 01:36:54,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, thank you.

1195
01:36:59,240 --> 01:36:59,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, and good luck.

1196
01:37:00,281 --> 01:37:00,761
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, sir.

1197
01:37:01,221 --> 01:37:03,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion for suspension by Councilor Dello Russo.

1198
01:37:06,374 --> 01:37:08,636
[SPEAKER_03]: 14708, offered by Councilor Knight.

1199
01:37:09,336 --> 01:37:21,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council Subcommittee on Zoning and Urbanism examine the issue of the use of electronic cigarettes in establishments where smoking is prohibited.

1200
01:37:21,647 --> 01:37:22,268
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight.

1201
01:37:22,788 --> 01:37:24,089
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

1202
01:37:25,010 --> 01:37:32,917
[SPEAKER_07]: On Friday evening, I was getting some takeout at Bocelli's, and as I was sitting at the bar waiting for my food, the gentleman beside me

1203
01:37:33,435 --> 01:37:35,876
[SPEAKER_07]: took an electronic cigarette out of his mouth and started smoking it.

1204
01:37:35,936 --> 01:37:38,056
[SPEAKER_07]: And it didn't mean much to me.

1205
01:37:38,096 --> 01:37:40,297
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just kind of looked at him and said, oh, wow.

1206
01:37:40,797 --> 01:37:54,221
[SPEAKER_07]: But the couple sitting next to me that was enjoying their dinner wasn't as pleased as I was to see this happen, Mr. President, which got me thinking, you know, what exactly is going on with the regulation of electronic cigarettes here in Medford?

1207
01:37:54,821 --> 01:38:02,043
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think with that being said, Mr. President, I did a little bit of research and I found some policy options, copies of which I forwarded to all my colleagues here.

1208
01:38:03,250 --> 01:38:07,554
[SPEAKER_07]: possibly to regulate the sale, regulate the marketing, or regulate the use of such electronic cigarettes.

1209
01:38:08,555 --> 01:38:13,819
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess the end all be all resolution would be to ban electronic cigarettes in all places where smoking is prohibited.

1210
01:38:13,859 --> 01:38:17,202
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the ideal language from the National Center of Tobacco Control.

1211
01:38:17,843 --> 01:38:22,067
[SPEAKER_07]: However, I don't know if that language would actually be something that would work here in Medford.

1212
01:38:22,427 --> 01:38:25,810
[SPEAKER_07]: So I thought it would be a worthy endeavor for the subcommittee on zoning and

1213
01:38:27,002 --> 01:38:33,183
[SPEAKER_07]: ordinances to examine it, to find out what our legal rights are and to find out whether or not it's worthwhile for us to come up with a resolution that would do such.

1214
01:38:33,883 --> 01:38:40,285
[SPEAKER_03]: I know personally of, um, the health department did receive a couple of calls from different people and they had gone down and spoken.

1215
01:38:40,385 --> 01:38:44,886
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I'm not mistaken, I think it is prohibited in places where smoking is prohibited.

1216
01:38:44,906 --> 01:38:47,986
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't say that for sure, but I do know of a couple of cases.

1217
01:38:49,267 --> 01:38:52,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, motion to send that to subcommittee by councilor Knight.

1218
01:38:52,547 --> 01:38:53,007
[SPEAKER_03]: All in favor.

1219
01:38:54,968 --> 01:38:55,488
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Marks.

1220
01:38:56,271 --> 01:39:04,074
[SPEAKER_09]: Where the suggestion of Councilor Knight is offered, should we ask maybe if we can get the Board of Health to give us an opinion first?

1221
01:39:04,154 --> 01:39:04,355
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1222
01:39:04,695 --> 01:39:06,736
[SPEAKER_09]: Rather than setting up a subcommittee meeting and so forth.

1223
01:39:06,776 --> 01:39:08,316
[SPEAKER_09]: It may be helpful.

1224
01:39:08,796 --> 01:39:10,457
[SPEAKER_03]: If I can amend that also, Councilor Knight.

1225
01:39:10,477 --> 01:39:16,360
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a store on Salem Street that just sells these.

1226
01:39:17,160 --> 01:39:20,181
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you, it's right on the corner of like Dudley and Grossman Valvoline.

1227
01:39:21,402 --> 01:39:21,562
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh?

1228
01:39:23,023 --> 01:39:23,883
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's not a convenience store.

1229
01:39:23,923 --> 01:39:25,844
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a store that's only sells

1230
01:39:26,649 --> 01:39:27,309
[SPEAKER_03]: electronic cigarettes.

1231
01:39:27,390 --> 01:39:29,691
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a, they're like a distributor there.

1232
01:39:30,632 --> 01:39:32,613
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe a check into what they sell there too.

1233
01:39:32,653 --> 01:39:35,535
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know, see if that falls into our code too.

1234
01:39:36,196 --> 01:39:36,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Penta.

1235
01:39:38,617 --> 01:39:51,006
[SPEAKER_20]: I'd like to further amend it to contact the state department of public health as it relates to, cause they, there is a state policy on electronic cigarettes and a cigarette is considered a cigarette no matter how you use it.

1236
01:39:51,106 --> 01:39:54,488
[SPEAKER_20]: So that may be able to just to cut right through the chase and get your answer.

1237
01:39:55,029 --> 01:39:55,189
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1238
01:39:56,375 --> 01:39:58,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Penta, could you repeat that back for the clerk?

1239
01:39:58,696 --> 01:40:01,716
[SPEAKER_20]: The State Department of Public Health as it relates to electronic cigarettes.

1240
01:40:02,997 --> 01:40:05,497
[SPEAKER_20]: Massachusetts State Department of Public Health.

1241
01:40:07,658 --> 01:40:09,258
[SPEAKER_09]: And Karen Rose, right?

1242
01:40:09,278 --> 01:40:12,219

[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

1255
01:40:45,574 --> 01:40:46,874
[SPEAKER_13]: I received a call on this.

1256
01:40:47,415 --> 01:40:49,236
[SPEAKER_13]: There is supposedly a sign missing.

1257
01:40:49,336 --> 01:40:51,337
[SPEAKER_13]: It did say parking by permit only.

1258
01:40:51,918 --> 01:40:53,819
[SPEAKER_13]: It's on the corner of Boston and Capon Street.

1259
01:40:53,879 --> 01:41:00,384
[SPEAKER_13]: So if I could move approval, see if the traffic commission can take a look at this and replace it at their earliest convenience.

1260
01:41:00,804 --> 01:41:01,104
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

01:41:05,528 --> 01:41:07,329

1266
01:41:07,949 --> 01:41:08,850
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

1267
01:41:10,771 --> 01:41:18,717
[SPEAKER_03]: Also on this mission, offered by Councilor Marks, be it resolved that the sinking road at 48 Stearns Ave

1268
01:41:19,526 --> 01:41:21,906
[SPEAKER_03]: be repaired in the interest of public safety.

1269
01:41:22,907 --> 01:41:23,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Marks.

1270
01:41:24,727 --> 01:41:25,787
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1271
01:41:25,807 --> 01:41:30,668
[SPEAKER_09]: Stearns have had some underground work done.

1272
01:41:30,688 --> 01:41:33,889
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe it was six months to a year ago.

1273
01:41:34,729 --> 01:41:44,191
[SPEAKER_09]: And part of the street I went by the other night, part of the street towards the lower end of Stearns Ave is actually sinking in where the work was done.

1274
01:41:44,591 --> 01:41:49,012
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would ask that clerk of the works from the city go out to that site immediately.

1275
01:41:49,868 --> 01:41:50,989
[SPEAKER_09]: and see what's happening.

1276
01:41:51,009 --> 01:41:51,269
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President.

1277
01:41:51,289 --> 01:41:52,810
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that recently paved at Pearl Street?

1278
01:41:52,830 --> 01:41:52,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1279
01:41:52,910 --> 01:41:56,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, what is the information?

1280
01:41:56,933 --> 01:41:57,774
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Donovan.

1281
01:41:58,354 --> 01:42:02,437
[SPEAKER_06]: As Councilor Marks knows, there and Pearl Street had major work done.

1282
01:42:03,158 --> 01:42:13,145
[SPEAKER_06]: And those are part of the long lamented repairs in South Medford that weren't carried out in a timely fashion.

1283
01:42:13,766 --> 01:42:15,367
[SPEAKER_06]: But I hope that gets redone.

1284
01:42:16,563 --> 01:42:20,425
[SPEAKER_06]: Quickly, I second your motion, Mr. President.
