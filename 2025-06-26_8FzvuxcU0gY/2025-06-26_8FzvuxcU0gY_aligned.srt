00:01:09,081 --> 00:01:10,242
Good evening, everyone.

2
00:01:10,442 --> 00:01:11,624
My name is Andre LaRue.

3
00:01:11,824 --> 00:01:15,589
I'm the chairperson of the Medford Community Development Board.

4
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:27,303
Welcome to the board's December 20, 2021 meeting, where we will conduct a meeting via Zoom remote video conferencing.

5
00:01:31,756 --> 00:01:37,642
20.20.2021.

6
00:01:32,537 --> 00:01:37,642
Medford Community Development Board hearing will be conducted via remote means.

7
00:01:37,902 --> 00:01:43,328
Members of the public who wish to access the meeting may do so by accessing the meeting link contained herein.

8
00:01:43,929 --> 00:01:51,557
No in-person attendance of members of the public will be permitted, and public participation in any public hearing during this meeting shall be by remote means only.

9
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:27,169
They are pretty lengthy and I'm gonna say that I would like to dig into them a little bit more, so I'd like to postpone consideration of these minutes until our next zoning meeting on January 5th, if that's all right.

10
00:03:27,189 --> 00:03:30,631
Yes, David?

11
00:03:32,432 --> 00:03:34,854
Would you entertain a motion along those lines?

12
00:03:35,594 --> 00:03:36,374
Yes, very much.

13
00:03:37,275 --> 00:03:38,976
Okay, I'd like to make a motion to

14
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:43,330
Oxford Properties Group applied for a special permit for site plan review for a project at this address in July of this year, if you all recall.

15
00:04:43,450 --> 00:05:01,273
When we conducted our site plan review and our conditions of approval, one of the conditions stated that, number five, prior to the issuance of a building permit for its tenant fit-out work, the applicant shall present further design details of the southwest corner facade of the building

16
00:07:09,197 --> 00:07:12,019
We are a global investor.

17
00:07:12,679 --> 00:07:19,363
We are heavily focused on life science in the U.S., as well as in some nascent markets like London and all throughout Canada.

18
00:07:20,944 --> 00:07:35,473
We are approximately $80 billion of assets globally, and we are a wholly owned subsidiary of OMERS, which is the Ontario Municipal Employee Retirement System.

19
00:08:05,065 --> 00:08:15,108
life science market, and we also believe very strongly in the CGMP facilities and manufacturing side, which has become a growing sector in that market.

20
00:08:15,249 --> 00:08:24,972
So this just gives you a quick overview of kind of how we got started through, you know, the biomed portfolio where we were on the debt side, 125 Lincoln and 645 Summer.

21
00:08:24,992 --> 00:08:28,273
645 Summer is part of a 42 acre site we're developing into life science.

22
00:09:00,562 --> 00:09:10,306
The tenant and the client market from really inception all the way through global recognition and manufacturing where it's right at your bedside.

23
00:09:10,566 --> 00:09:18,769
So anyways, it's an exciting sector for us and we believe strongly in Medford and we're very excited to move this forward.

24
00:09:19,109 --> 00:09:24,110
I'll turn it over to Will and John to kind of give updates as to where we are on this project in particular.

25
00:09:27,992 --> 00:09:28,412
Thanks, Matt.

26
00:09:29,082 --> 00:09:30,562
Will Nichols, Oxford Properties.

27
00:09:31,503 --> 00:09:34,143
As Matt said, we're excited to be here.

28
00:09:34,163 --> 00:09:38,504
We're excited to report that we've made a ton of progress since we were last in front of you in August.

29
00:09:40,005 --> 00:09:42,365
Since then, we've buttoned up our design.

30
00:09:42,465 --> 00:09:45,326
We've gotten approval for demo activities to proceed.

31
00:09:46,126 --> 00:09:50,347
We actually just got our building permit approval last week, which is, like I said, really exciting for us.

32
00:09:51,628 --> 00:09:56,929
But yeah, looking at this aerial photograph, I don't know if everyone's familiar with the site, but essentially,

33
00:11:14,558 --> 00:11:14,938
Thanks Will.

34
00:11:16,199 --> 00:11:17,439
John Sullivan with SGA.

35
00:11:17,859 --> 00:11:22,241
We are the architects for the project, also very excited to be here to present before the board.

36
00:11:23,722 --> 00:11:35,827
Will just gave a great update of all of the work that's happening on site, and we figured it would be good to share this image to show the building and describe, kind of remind everyone what is remaining and what is coming down.

37
00:12:13,215 --> 00:12:19,881
Especially when it comes to the site's history, but also very much a progressive statement.

38
00:14:12,372 --> 00:14:16,654
Especially when you look at it from a distance, you can see that there is a lot of space in front of the building.

39
00:14:59,449 --> 00:15:07,853
On this right-hand part of the façade that we focused on, the reason we did that was again because of the relationship between the façade itself and the street.

40
00:15:08,033 --> 00:15:13,276
The loading area again is just kind of tucked back and our goal there was to just kind of calm it down and clean it up.

41
00:15:14,076 --> 00:15:18,738
But on the façade that pulls closer to the street, you can see that there's some signage elements on the top corners.

42
00:17:47,904 --> 00:17:57,888
We think that this will be detailed in a very clean way, be very organized, will have some of that industrial nature and also kind of has a little bit of that techie feel.

43
00:17:58,848 --> 00:18:08,512
So the thought with the screen wall itself was to tie it into the architecture of the building, let it recede behind the planting, and let it visually mitigate some of the tanks that sit behind it.

44
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,442
Thank you, John and the rest of your team.

45
00:18:43,643 --> 00:18:48,047
Let me open it up for comments and questions by members of the board.

46
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:52,272
Maybe, John, you could stop sharing right now, and if we have to pull something up, we should put that back.

47
00:18:55,956 --> 00:18:56,557
Great, thank you.

48
00:18:56,577 --> 00:19:00,741
Thank you.

49
00:19:00,841 --> 00:19:02,303
Reactions from board members.

50
00:20:14,643 --> 00:20:16,143
Especially the type of asset that it is.

51
00:20:16,163 --> 00:20:23,186
I think it's a nice gesture to try to bring some creativity to that building.

52
00:20:23,206 --> 00:20:38,810
I don't know if it's more than it deserves in this corridor, but I would hope that maybe this sets a little bit of a precedence for an interesting design for any future development that could happen here as well.

53
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:39,230
Nice job.

54
00:22:27,184 --> 00:22:38,435
This corrugated metal, which is partially perforated, will sit there and the same corrugation is tied into the darker gray material.

55
00:22:39,355 --> 00:22:43,559
There's kind of corrugation throughout in this facade, so that's an extension of that language.

56
00:22:44,961 --> 00:22:46,042
Okay, thank you very much.

57
00:22:46,062 --> 00:22:46,782
I appreciate that.

58
00:23:20,334 --> 00:23:29,179
John, if we could go back to the southwest façade.

59
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:31,801
Could you show the corner actually?

60
00:23:31,821 --> 00:23:33,862
The southwest corner, yeah.

61
00:23:34,302 --> 00:23:36,523
So just I guess a question.

62
00:23:36,543 --> 00:23:44,687
I don't recall exactly back from July, but I seem to remember that there were along that

63
00:24:59,275 --> 00:25:02,938
Sikkimore Ave, Sikkimore Ave, Sikkimore Ave, Sikkimore Ave, Sikkimore Ave,

64
00:28:49,472 --> 00:28:49,832
Thank you.

65
00:28:54,415 --> 00:28:56,256
Other comments and questions from board members?

66
00:29:08,684 --> 00:29:17,730
No, I see in here none, so I would be open to entertaining a motion from the board to

67
00:30:17,536 --> 00:30:18,456
Thank you so much, everyone.

68
00:30:18,657 --> 00:30:19,957
We hope you have a happy holiday season.

69
00:30:20,938 --> 00:30:21,378
Same to you.

70
00:30:21,398 --> 00:30:22,698
See you in 2022.

71
00:30:22,958 --> 00:30:25,560
All right, take care.

72
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:26,260
Thank you.

73
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,481
Thank you, bye-bye.

74
00:30:29,582 --> 00:30:44,588
All right, so we have just next on our agenda only some miscellaneous updates.

75
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:30,768
That being said, we should plan to schedule another meeting.

76
00:35:30,869 --> 00:35:32,690
And Amanda, were you going to get to that part?

77
00:35:34,651 --> 00:35:38,253
Yes, and I don't know if it makes sense to do this offline.

78
00:35:38,373 --> 00:35:41,555
But so, OK, two things.

79
00:35:42,155 --> 00:35:44,596
We have this meeting on the 5th.

80
00:35:46,037 --> 00:35:53,682
There is an anticipated application for site plan review for early December, which

81
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,281
Thanks everybody for doing this.

82
00:39:14,341 --> 00:39:19,365
I think, yeah, shorter meetings, even if they're more frequent are better, so we're trying.

83
00:39:19,925 --> 00:39:21,106
I can definitely get behind this.

84
00:39:21,747 --> 00:39:26,911
Yeah, before 7, talk about a record breaker.

85
00:39:29,272 --> 00:39:30,073
So thanks everybody.

86
00:39:30,613 --> 00:39:32,335
This is our New Year's gift to all of you.

87
00:39:33,215 --> 00:39:37,879
I got to tell you guys the best story about this.

88
00:39:41,672 --> 00:39:46,934
Somebody just offered me Celtics tickets, so I'm going to the Celtics game.

89
00:39:46,954 --> 00:39:50,395
I had said no.

90
00:39:50,495 --> 00:39:51,395
That's pretty awesome.

91
00:39:51,415 --> 00:39:55,736
I was like, no, I'm not going to be able to make it.

92
00:39:56,836 --> 00:40:00,157
All right, so we can put that in our list of outcomes.

93
00:40:02,198 --> 00:40:02,878
Happy New Year.

94
00:40:04,799 --> 00:40:06,899
Motion it in so that Klaes can get to his game.

95
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,380
Is there a sec, guys?
