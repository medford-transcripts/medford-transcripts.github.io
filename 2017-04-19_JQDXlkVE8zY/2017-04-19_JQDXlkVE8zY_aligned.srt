Please rise and salute the flag.

18
00:01:43,782 --> 00:01:45,563
I pledge allegiance to the flag

19
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:55,771
one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

20
00:02:02,276 --> 00:02:04,938
Motion by Councillor Knight to take a paper out of order.

21
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:06,900
Seconded by Councillor Scarpelli.

22
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,061
All those in favour?

23
00:02:08,881 --> 00:02:09,042
Aye.

24
00:02:09,202 --> 00:02:10,062
Motion passes.

25
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:11,003
Councillor Knight.

26
00:02:13,065 --> 00:02:18,309
Mr. President, I move to take paper 1771, the Wage Theft Prevention Ordinance, from the table.

27
00:02:18,609 --> 00:02:20,591
It is eligible this evening for its third reading.

28
00:02:21,118 --> 00:02:24,941
This is a paper that has gone through the subcommittee process and through the committee of the whole process.

29
00:02:24,961 --> 00:02:33,486
And what it is, Mr. President, is it's a proposal to ensure that people that are bidding on public contracts here in the city of Medford comply with the wage and hour laws.

30
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:47,296
It requires that a series of certifications are made and a series of statements of credibility are made to the administration so that when they're awarding a contract, the individuals that are awarded the contract have not been found in violation of any wage and hour laws.

31
00:02:48,136 --> 00:02:50,398
Wage theft is a problem across the country, Mr. President.

32
00:02:50,765 --> 00:02:55,069
It's something that we see here in Massachusetts a lot of times with contracts like cleaning contracts.

33
00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:00,854
For example, the high school has a cleaning contract, and they may bring people in to clean the high school.

34
00:03:01,395 --> 00:03:04,618
And the prevailing wage rate, which they are supposed to be paid by law, is $26 an hour.

35
00:03:06,121 --> 00:03:10,702
But these employees are hourly workers that make $18 an hour when not working on the prevailing wage.

36
00:03:10,722 --> 00:03:12,983
And their employer will withhold those funds, Mr. President.

37
00:03:13,023 --> 00:03:15,783
So they're actually employers that are stealing money from their employees.

38
00:03:16,164 --> 00:03:25,986
So this ordinance requires that people that are bidding on public projects that are covered under the prevailing wage laws and other state and federal hour and wage laws, Mr. President, are in compliance.

39
00:03:26,086 --> 00:03:29,587
They inform the city whether or not they've been found in violation.

40
00:03:29,627 --> 00:03:33,208
And they take out certain bonds if they have been found in violation.

41
00:03:33,826 --> 00:03:39,012
With us here this evening we have some individuals that were instrumental in putting this work, this ordinance together, Mr. President.

42
00:03:39,572 --> 00:03:43,036
This is a paper that was originated through a group called Community Labor United.

43
00:03:43,977 --> 00:03:47,320
It's been a matter that's been endorsed and supported by the Greater Boston Labor Council.

44
00:03:47,721 --> 00:03:50,984
And here this evening with us from the Greater Boston Labor Council we have Rich Rogers.

45
00:03:51,784 --> 00:03:56,347
We also have representing Sean O'Brien from Local 25, James Donovan, political director.

46
00:03:57,267 --> 00:04:00,469
We have from Local 537, Bill Young here with us this evening.

47
00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:10,134
I'd be remiss not to mention Louie Mandarini from Local 22, a long-time Medford resident, Mr. President, who was instrumental in crafting this language and also helped with some technical assistance.

48
00:04:11,195 --> 00:04:13,476
And also with us, we have Phil Reason from the Painters Union here.

49
00:04:14,376 --> 00:04:19,539
Mr. President, this is a paper that Mayor Burke and I worked on in concert with the individuals that have been aforementioned.

50
00:04:19,969 --> 00:04:24,070
It's something that I wholeheartedly support, and I'd ask my colleagues this evening to vote in favor of it.

51
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,350
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

52
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,550
Councilor DelaRusso?

53
00:04:29,071 --> 00:04:29,371
Second.

54
00:04:31,311 --> 00:04:38,692
On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor DelaRusso, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

55
00:04:42,473 --> 00:04:43,353
Councilor DelaRusso?

56
00:04:43,513 --> 00:04:43,793
Yes.

57
00:04:45,073 --> 00:04:45,853
Councilor Falco?

58
00:04:45,913 --> 00:04:46,033
Yes.

59
00:04:46,574 --> 00:04:47,054
Councilor Knight?

60
00:04:47,254 --> 00:04:47,474
Yes.

61
00:04:48,314 --> 00:04:48,994
Councilor Kerrio?

62
00:04:49,014 --> 00:04:49,074
Yes.

63
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:50,655
Vice President Marx.

64
00:04:50,956 --> 00:04:51,276
Yes.

65
00:04:51,716 --> 00:04:52,537
Councilor Scott Kelly.

66
00:04:52,617 --> 00:04:52,897
Yes.

67
00:04:54,138 --> 00:04:54,878
President Caviello.

68
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:55,699
Yes.

69
00:04:55,719 --> 00:04:59,221
17 in the affirmative, none in the negative.

70
00:05:00,421 --> 00:05:01,182
Motion passes.

71
00:05:01,222 --> 00:05:02,182
While we're under suspension.

72
00:05:02,202 --> 00:05:02,182
17, 3, 7, 2.

73
00:05:03,363 --> 00:05:02,182
17, 3, 7, 0.

74
00:05:03,723 --> 00:05:02,182
17, 3, 7, 2.

75
00:05:04,464 --> 00:05:02,182
17, 3, 7, 2.

76
00:05:18,646 --> 00:05:27,609
petition for sign denial reversal by Jason Perillo, a back bay sign for Georgia's bakery, 25 Hall Street, Medford.

77
00:05:28,029 --> 00:05:31,750
OCD application 2017-3 exceeds allowable size 94-307-2.

78
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:35,691
Vice President Marks is chairman of the sign committee.

79
00:05:45,393 --> 00:05:47,394
Yes, Mr. President, we have the petition in front of us.

80
00:05:47,475 --> 00:05:52,038
If you can just give us a brief synopsis on the sign itself.

81
00:05:53,278 --> 00:05:55,440
Good evening, Mr. President, members of the council.

82
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:57,621
I'm Jason Perillo with Back Bay sign company.

83
00:05:58,322 --> 00:06:08,368
Um, our petition to hear tonight is to ask petition to ask for permission to install a wall sign for Georgia's bakery products incorporated over at 25 hall street.

84
00:06:09,727 --> 00:06:15,029
The, uh, sign that we propose this evening is 35 square feet over what the ordinance allows.

85
00:06:15,109 --> 00:06:17,430
The building is 111 feet wide.

86
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:21,392
Um, the sign is designed to fit the architecture of the building.

87
00:06:22,092 --> 00:06:23,993
Um, the sign is not illuminated.

88
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:26,614
There are no residences that can see the sign.

89
00:06:27,414 --> 00:06:31,816
And, um, if you, uh, George is also here this evening, if you have any questions for the business owner.

90
00:06:31,976 --> 00:06:32,496
Thank you very much.

91
00:06:32,516 --> 00:06:33,636
Mr. President.

92
00:06:36,838 --> 00:06:37,738
Councilor Dela Rosa.

93
00:06:39,286 --> 00:06:44,770
I see no reason to object to this request for variance.

94
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:51,234
This gentleman brings business and good commerce to the city of Medford.

95
00:06:52,475 --> 00:06:58,499
It's a decent family business, and we wish them all the best.

96
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,100
And I have no objection.

97
00:07:00,161 --> 00:07:01,521
Motion for approval, Mr. President.

98
00:07:01,562 --> 00:07:01,902
Thank you.

99
00:07:02,502 --> 00:07:03,583
Councillor Neistat.

100
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:07,646
Mr. President, George's Bakery has been in this community for a very long time without incident,

101
00:07:08,365 --> 00:07:08,685
issue.

102
00:07:09,045 --> 00:07:10,866
Um, I get some bread from there every once in a while.

103
00:07:10,906 --> 00:07:11,487
I'm not going to lie.

104
00:07:12,007 --> 00:07:20,112
And, um, I certainly think that, uh, this proposal that's before us this evening is within reason and, um, meets the spirit and intent of the zoning ordinance, uh, relative to signage.

105
00:07:20,572 --> 00:07:23,694
And I too move for approval with a second to council Della Russo's motion.

106
00:07:24,014 --> 00:07:25,655
Thank you.

107
00:07:25,675 --> 00:07:26,235
Vice-president Max.

108
00:07:26,255 --> 00:07:28,516
He, he motion for motion for approval.

109
00:07:29,037 --> 00:07:30,097
Thank you, Mr. President.

110
00:07:30,297 --> 00:07:34,940
Uh, based on the paperwork submitted, uh, and the, uh,

111
00:07:35,842 --> 00:07:38,443
rendering of the sign itself and the location of the sign.

112
00:07:39,224 --> 00:07:52,771
I too see, uh, um, no concern with the size of the sign, even though it's nonconforming to existing, um, zoning sign ordinances.

113
00:07:53,672 --> 00:07:58,995
And, um, at this point, Mr. President, it's not internally illuminated.

114
00:07:59,015 --> 00:08:02,937
Um, and at this point that would move approval, Mr. President.

115
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:07,503
On the motion by vice president marks seconded by councilor night.

116
00:08:08,684 --> 00:08:09,444
All those in favor.

117
00:08:09,524 --> 00:08:12,445
Oh, I have, I have, I'm sorry.

118
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:16,286
Um, council marks is the sign a committee chairman.

119
00:08:16,306 --> 00:08:16,486
Right?

120
00:08:17,226 --> 00:08:18,647
Motion comes from the sign chairman.

121
00:08:18,747 --> 00:08:19,267
That's correct.

122
00:08:20,768 --> 00:08:22,328
And seconded by councilor Donald Russo.

123
00:08:22,348 --> 00:08:23,188
All those in favor.

124
00:08:24,409 --> 00:08:25,189
Motion passes.

125
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:27,010
Thank you very much.

126
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:27,690
Thank you very much.

127
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,651
So George, good luck.

128
00:08:30,831 --> 00:08:33,532
Um, if we could also take, um,

129
00:08:35,634 --> 00:08:45,058
17352, the nominees while they're here, that were appointed last week that are coming here to be vetted this evening.

130
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,041
Mr. Scott, would you second that motion?

131
00:08:51,061 --> 00:08:51,961
I second that motion.

132
00:08:52,001 --> 00:08:52,261
Thank you.

133
00:08:53,822 --> 00:09:03,526
This evening, we have some people that were selected to be on the Community Preservation Committee, and under the rule of transparency,

134
00:09:04,276 --> 00:09:08,178
We feel that it's good to vet all these candidates.

135
00:09:08,198 --> 00:09:18,102
So at this point, while they're here, when we ask your name, if you could please come to the podium and give us a little brief resume.

136
00:09:18,982 --> 00:09:19,642
Is Jones here?

137
00:09:19,902 --> 00:09:20,363
Jones here?

138
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:25,785
Name and address of the record, please.

139
00:09:26,425 --> 00:09:28,686
Jones here, 40 Cedar Road North, Medford.

140
00:09:30,086 --> 00:09:35,933
So I sent an application in to the mayor for a seat on the Community Preservation Commission.

141
00:09:36,454 --> 00:09:45,925
As many of you know, I'm a resident of Medford, 17 years, was part of the Preserve Medford campaign committee a couple of years ago to collect signatures to get the CPA on the ballot.

142
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,189
And when it did pass, I was a member of the ad hoc committee.

143
00:09:49,893 --> 00:09:54,655
that was assembled to draft the ordinance and to usher it to completion to the City Council.

144
00:09:56,295 --> 00:10:08,259
In the application, it stated, you know, that an applicant should be a resident who has expertise or demonstrated interest in open space, recreation, historic preservation, and affordable housing, among other things.

145
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,621
And that's what I sort of applied for because

146
00:10:13,001 --> 00:10:15,804
Improving these things in the City of Medford is very important to me.

147
00:10:15,844 --> 00:10:19,667
I know that these are the things that are usually on the bottom of the list when it comes to budget time.

148
00:10:19,707 --> 00:10:26,454
Of course, police, fire, safety, those kinds of things are much more important and usually get the dollars, and these ones don't.

149
00:10:26,494 --> 00:10:27,855
So this is one of the reasons why

150
00:10:28,288 --> 00:10:35,109
I really felt that we could bring some good dollars to Medford, that we could improve the city and bring money into Medford by improving the city.

151
00:10:35,149 --> 00:10:45,191
So my certification as a project manager, one of the things that I do is I help the others that are in the room kind of use their expertise and bring it to fruition.

152
00:10:45,231 --> 00:10:51,352
So I'm the one who sort of helps people remove roadblocks, bring people together, open communication, that kind of thing.

153
00:10:51,392 --> 00:10:56,173
And that is the expertise that I could bring to this committee to kind of help the process move along and keep in time.

154
00:10:57,169 --> 00:11:04,671
That's why I applied, and I would appreciate your support, and I really do hope to help Medford become a more inviting city.

155
00:11:05,371 --> 00:11:05,811
Thank you, Sharon.

156
00:11:06,812 --> 00:11:07,652
Councilor Scott Pelley.

157
00:11:08,332 --> 00:11:10,553
I move to approval for Joan Cyr.

158
00:11:10,573 --> 00:11:26,157
I know that Joan's done so many great things in our community, and her dedication and commitment and her leadership is going to drastically be needed with such a huge endeavor, so I move forward to accept Joan Cyr.

159
00:11:26,801 --> 00:11:27,742
as one of our members.

160
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:28,382
Thank you.

161
00:11:28,923 --> 00:11:29,623
Councillor Falco.

162
00:11:29,843 --> 00:11:30,524
Thank you, Mr. President.

163
00:11:30,544 --> 00:11:33,085
I just wanted to second Councillor Scott Pelley.

164
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:39,610
I worked with Joan on the CPC committee when we put together the resolution.

165
00:11:40,871 --> 00:11:42,232
She was vital to the process.

166
00:11:42,772 --> 00:11:46,414
She's smart, she's committed, and I know she'll do a great job.

167
00:11:46,475 --> 00:11:51,878
This commission is going to be working very hard, especially in its infancy.

168
00:11:51,938 --> 00:11:54,120
So I think I, you know, I definitely support

169
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:59,484
her being an appointee to this commission, and I just want to say good luck.

170
00:11:59,684 --> 00:11:59,965
Thank you.

171
00:12:00,245 --> 00:12:00,565
Thank you.

172
00:12:00,805 --> 00:12:02,067
Councillor Knight.

173
00:12:02,087 --> 00:12:04,249
Yes, Mr. President, if you review Ms.

174
00:12:04,269 --> 00:12:11,535
Cyr's resume in contrast with the ordinance and the requirements that are set forth in the ordinance relative to what would make an appropriate appointee, you'll see that Ms.

175
00:12:11,555 --> 00:12:12,616
Cyr hits all the high spots.

176
00:12:13,257 --> 00:12:19,963
I, too, had the opportunity to work with her on the community preservation commission subcommittee that helped draft the ordinance.

177
00:12:20,436 --> 00:12:23,278
And I wanted to thank her for her technical expertise and her input and involvement.

178
00:12:23,298 --> 00:12:24,660
Mr. President, this is a great appointment.

179
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,161
It's someone that I'd wholeheartedly support.

180
00:12:26,561 --> 00:12:29,884
And I'd like to thank you for the opportunity for having us come up here this evening and vet this.

181
00:12:30,284 --> 00:12:31,085
I move approval as well.

182
00:12:31,105 --> 00:12:31,385
Thank you.

183
00:12:32,266 --> 00:12:33,066
Councilor Dela Rousseau.

184
00:12:33,507 --> 00:12:33,987
President.

185
00:12:34,007 --> 00:12:36,229
Uh, I was prepared to approve this last week.

186
00:12:36,309 --> 00:12:37,670
I'm prepared again.

187
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:40,973
Uh, tonight I had the delight of appointing her.

188
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:41,573
Thank you.

189
00:12:41,593 --> 00:12:44,335
Community preservation, uh, preservation commission.

190
00:12:45,176 --> 00:12:45,977
Thank you.

191
00:12:46,137 --> 00:12:47,078
Um, thank you briefly.

192
00:12:47,098 --> 00:12:49,980
I just want to thank Joan and all the other members that are,

193
00:12:50,518 --> 00:12:53,801
have been appointed and coming to let us vet them tonight.

194
00:12:53,841 --> 00:12:59,406
I want to thank them for being here and thank them for wanting to be on such a committee that's going to take a lot of time and effort.

195
00:12:59,906 --> 00:13:03,969
Joan is definitely going to do a great job, so I wish her the best of luck.

196
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:15,759
I would ask that all the members, obviously, we'd love to be able to get the minutes of the meetings, whether it's email or hard copy of the minutes of the meetings, and to keep us informed so we know how the process is going.

197
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,380
Thank you.

198
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,000
Thank you.

199
00:13:17,641 --> 00:13:18,402
Vice President Mox.

200
00:13:19,694 --> 00:13:20,675
Thank you, Mr. President.

201
00:13:21,055 --> 00:13:29,438
And, uh, I'm happy that the council last week, uh, voted to invite all the, uh, appointments, uh, to this council.

202
00:13:30,118 --> 00:13:44,684
And, uh, I think we all realize that this is a good group of candidates and it was nice to hear Joan, that you appreciate the responsibilities of this particular appointment and also know that, uh, it does impact open space within our community.

203
00:13:45,217 --> 00:13:49,280
uh, historic preservation, housing, and a number of really important issues.

204
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:55,503
So, uh, I believe it's roughly a million dollars a year that'll be generated through, uh, the CPA.

205
00:13:56,004 --> 00:14:00,546
Uh, so it is an important task and I know you as one person will take this very seriously.

206
00:14:01,067 --> 00:14:05,729
And again, Mr. President, I, uh, agree with my colleagues and, uh, move approval.

207
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:06,150
Thank you.

208
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:10,953
Outstanding choice on the motion by councilor Della Russo seconded by councilor Scott Pelly.

209
00:14:11,653 --> 00:14:14,675
All those in favor, motion passes.

210
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:15,681
Joan.

211
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:16,161
Thank you.

212
00:14:16,341 --> 00:14:16,701
Thank you.

213
00:14:16,721 --> 00:14:30,865
Um, Roberta Cameron said she, she's going to be a little late, so we'll get, we'll get her when she comes in.

214
00:14:31,165 --> 00:14:32,065
Elizabeth Carey.

215
00:14:32,085 --> 00:14:32,805
Sue, are you here?

216
00:14:36,686 --> 00:14:37,086
Good evening.

217
00:14:37,106 --> 00:14:38,167
Name and address of the record, please.

218
00:14:38,727 --> 00:14:40,327
My name's Elizabeth Curie soul.

219
00:14:40,687 --> 00:14:43,048
My address is 50 Douglas road.

220
00:14:44,855 --> 00:14:47,457
So I'm a relatively new resident of Medford.

221
00:14:47,497 --> 00:14:56,822
I've been here for just under two years and I'm extremely excited about living here and really excited about the prospect that CPA funds could bring to Medford.

222
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:58,723
I'm a landscape architect.

223
00:14:58,803 --> 00:15:02,225
I've been working as a landscape architect for about seven years.

224
00:15:03,046 --> 00:15:06,168
I currently work for the Trustees of Reservations as a project manager.

225
00:15:06,188 --> 00:15:10,150
I manage their capital projects along

226
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:19,913
structures and landscapes or restorations of historic landscapes and new buildings on our properties and specifically on our historically significant properties.

227
00:15:20,334 --> 00:15:34,619
So I think I bring a lot of project management experience, a lot of appreciation for landscape and open spaces, appreciation for historic restoration, and I'm extremely excited about the prospect of being involved in this committee.

228
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,240
Thank you.

229
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:36,780
Counselor Knight.

230
00:15:37,528 --> 00:15:39,629
Mr. President, once again, if you take a look at Ms.

231
00:15:39,649 --> 00:15:47,090
Sewell's resume and contrast that with the ordinance and the criteria that's put forth therein, you'll see that she meets all the major requirements that have been put forth.

232
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:57,292
It appears to me, although I don't know the woman personally, that she's been a qualified and dedicated professional in her field of expertise, and she's someone that I will have no problem supporting this evening.

233
00:15:57,332 --> 00:15:57,973
I move for approval.

234
00:15:58,633 --> 00:15:58,973
Thank you.

235
00:16:00,633 --> 00:16:04,194
On the motion by Councilor Nye, seconded by Councilor Lungo-Kern, Councilor Mox,

236
00:16:05,095 --> 00:16:06,096
Thank you, Mr. President.

237
00:16:06,336 --> 00:16:07,617
It's nice to see Elizabeth.

238
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:09,458
And I welcome you to the community.

239
00:16:09,498 --> 00:16:09,858
Thank you.

240
00:16:10,118 --> 00:16:10,539
Two years.

241
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:11,099
You're a rookie.

242
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,661
So welcome to the community.

243
00:16:14,061 --> 00:16:16,642
Thank you for partaking on a very important committee.

244
00:16:17,383 --> 00:16:23,967
And I was just wondering if you had any feedback relative to the lack of funding.

245
00:16:24,688 --> 00:16:29,531
Originally, this program started off with matching funds from the state.

246
00:16:30,011 --> 00:16:31,612
And over the years, it has dwindled down.

247
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:35,891
to I think it's at 18% now or maybe even less than that.

248
00:16:36,251 --> 00:16:38,532
Do you have any thoughts on that or?

249
00:16:39,872 --> 00:16:42,433
I mean, it's concerning that it's dwindling.

250
00:16:43,213 --> 00:16:54,677
I hope that positive projects and positive success of the initiative will, you know, give reason for better matching in the future.

251
00:16:56,878 --> 00:17:00,659
So hopefully the success of the initiative will continue its longevity.

252
00:17:01,189 --> 00:17:01,489
Thank you.

253
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,210
I also move approval, Mr. President.

254
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:03,630
Thank you.

255
00:17:05,151 --> 00:17:08,873
On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Malcolm Kern.

256
00:17:09,413 --> 00:17:10,174
All those in favor.

257
00:17:10,814 --> 00:17:10,934
Aye.

258
00:17:11,894 --> 00:17:12,635
Motion passes.

259
00:17:13,315 --> 00:17:15,136
Congratulations and thank you for your service.

260
00:17:15,176 --> 00:17:15,716
Thank you so much.

261
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:22,920
Joseph Okora.

262
00:17:28,817 --> 00:17:29,199
Good evening.

263
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:30,384
Name and address of the record, please.

264
00:17:30,404 --> 00:17:33,237
Joe Pecora, 25 Adams Street, Medford.

265
00:17:34,102 --> 00:17:36,923
You want to give a little brief synopsis of yourself?

266
00:17:36,983 --> 00:17:37,223
Sure.

267
00:17:37,964 --> 00:17:40,525
I've been living in Medford for about five years now.

268
00:17:41,285 --> 00:17:46,107
And I work as a real estate agent out of Cambridge.

269
00:17:46,287 --> 00:17:48,888
I've been practicing as a real estate agent for about 15 years.

270
00:17:49,989 --> 00:17:51,529
I come from the trades.

271
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:58,072
My family's involved with development in the suburbs, in the metro Boston region.

272
00:17:58,592 --> 00:18:02,174
And I think I bring the experience both as

273
00:18:03,854 --> 00:18:07,116
real estate agent and as a contractor to the table.

274
00:18:07,656 --> 00:18:10,057
And I look forward to working on the committee.

275
00:18:10,557 --> 00:18:10,878
Thank you.

276
00:18:11,098 --> 00:18:11,638
Councilor Knight.

277
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:23,504
Mr. President, if you review Mr. Pecora's resume and contrast with the city ordinance, you'll see that he also hits all the high points in terms of criteria that's been established.

278
00:18:23,664 --> 00:18:29,227
As we all know, the Community Preservation Act does have a focus number one on land acquisition and number two on affordable housing.

279
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:32,849
And I think he brings some much needed expertise in those fields and I move for approval.

280
00:18:33,329 --> 00:18:33,649
Thank you.

281
00:18:34,229 --> 00:18:35,089
Vice President Mox.

282
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,270
Thank you, Mr. President.

283
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:45,392
And this may be a good opportunity for members of the committee to meet each other also, which is a great suggestion.

284
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:57,336
Joe, knowing that you're in the field of real estate, what are your thoughts about what this community needs in regards to affordable housing?

285
00:18:57,356 --> 00:18:59,056
Do you think we're where we should be?

286
00:18:59,516 --> 00:19:02,517
Do you think that there's a need for additional

287
00:19:03,046 --> 00:19:03,707
affordable housing?

288
00:19:03,847 --> 00:19:09,954
I don't know what the numbers are, what the stats reflect, but I know that's a concern as prices continue to soar.

289
00:19:11,096 --> 00:19:20,868
I know in other areas closer to, you know, Cambridge, Somerville and those markets, Somerville's been seeing real new price points, a million dollar condos left and right now.

290
00:19:20,908 --> 00:19:21,669
I know Medford's been

291
00:19:22,267 --> 00:19:32,397
moving up as well in terms of price, and I think it's a pretty big concern for the community, pushing people out and not having a fairly decent mix of people from all walks of life.

292
00:19:33,057 --> 00:19:41,325
And I think it's important to consider and to work toward making sure that we create opportunities that are affordable for people.

293
00:19:41,886 --> 00:19:47,411
I would imagine that Medford is feeling a pinch as well, rents as well as sales.

294
00:19:48,746 --> 00:19:56,310
I know just recently, the other day on North Street, there were a couple of condos that sold for a million dollars, almost a million in Medford.

295
00:19:57,611 --> 00:20:05,475
So people are talking about price, rents are high, and yeah, I think it's a pretty significant question or point.

296
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:07,096
You ought to look at it.

297
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:15,420
Mr. President, so far, we've seen three candidates, and they all have their own expertise and style.

298
00:20:16,093 --> 00:20:28,295
And it's refreshing to hear Joe just mention the fact that with the housing market, as we know in Cambridge, Somerville, and Methodist experiencing right now, that there is a lack of affordability in this community.

299
00:20:28,956 --> 00:20:37,357
And I know with my children and other children in the community, that's a big concern that eventually someday they may not be able to afford to live in this community.

300
00:20:37,897 --> 00:20:43,399
And when you hear Joe mention that, that is something that's on his radar and he's well aware of it.

301
00:20:43,999 --> 00:20:45,699
It makes me feel comfortable as one member

302
00:20:46,107 --> 00:20:56,214
Although a million dollars every year may not go far to adding a lot of additional affordable housing, but it's something that this committee will be responsible for.

303
00:20:56,294 --> 00:20:58,916
So I also, Mr. President, move approval.

304
00:20:59,136 --> 00:20:59,496
Thank you.

305
00:21:00,817 --> 00:21:04,980
On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Marks.

306
00:21:05,861 --> 00:21:06,581
All those in favor?

307
00:21:06,601 --> 00:21:07,041
Aye.

308
00:21:07,702 --> 00:21:08,422
Motion passes.

309
00:21:08,462 --> 00:21:11,805
Congratulations and thank you for your time and volunteers in our community.

310
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,140
Heidi Davis.

311
00:21:21,622 --> 00:21:23,884
Nope.

312
00:21:26,865 --> 00:21:28,126
Just those four, we're not gonna do the other ones?

313
00:21:30,307 --> 00:21:32,268
Okay.

314
00:21:38,772 --> 00:21:44,275
And we're just waiting for Roberta to come, she'll be in later and we'll do her when she gets here.

315
00:21:46,482 --> 00:21:47,943
We'll table this until Roberta.

316
00:21:48,123 --> 00:21:49,824
Yeah, table the paper.

317
00:21:50,384 --> 00:21:56,246
On the motion to table by Council Member Kern, and seconded by Councilor Scott Pelley.

318
00:21:58,127 --> 00:21:58,747
All those in favor?

319
00:21:59,407 --> 00:21:59,727
Okay.

320
00:22:02,328 --> 00:22:05,429
Councilor Knight has requested a brief recess.

321
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:06,710
All those in favor?

322
00:25:04,175 --> 00:25:06,157
Motion to return back to regular business.

323
00:25:06,917 --> 00:25:22,510
While we're under suspension, 17370, offered by Councilor Longo Kern, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council vote to support the establishment of a local historic district at 21 Toro Avenue.

324
00:25:23,191 --> 00:25:24,252
Councilor Longo Kern.

325
00:25:24,812 --> 00:25:27,134
Thank you, President Carviello.

326
00:25:27,655 --> 00:25:30,437
There was a number of meetings and a number of

327
00:25:31,132 --> 00:25:37,295
neighbors that were concerned about the property at 21 Toro Ave.

328
00:25:38,415 --> 00:25:52,822
It was purchased about a year ago and the neighborhood really worked with the Medford Historical Commission to create a local historic district for 21 Toro.

329
00:25:53,322 --> 00:26:00,205
It's something that the neighborhood is extremely excited about and it was quite refreshing having attended those meetings with

330
00:26:00,663 --> 00:26:09,145
a few of my colleagues, refreshing to have the owners of 21 Toro Ave be on board and almost excited about this endeavor.

331
00:26:09,265 --> 00:26:12,526
So it's something that's long overdue for the council approval.

332
00:26:13,006 --> 00:26:24,169
And I would like to vote on that tonight that we make 21 Toro Ave a local historic district to preserve the history of the property and into the future.

333
00:26:24,189 --> 00:26:24,929
Um, this will,

334
00:26:25,509 --> 00:26:33,074
be recorded at the Registry of Deeds, and it's something that is long overdue to be voted by the Council, and hopefully we can all support this and move forward.

335
00:26:33,114 --> 00:26:41,500
And I believe we're the last step in getting this push forward, so I think it's something that we need to act on sooner than later.

336
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,121
Thank you, Councilor Locren.

337
00:26:43,961 --> 00:26:44,782
Councilor Scarpelli.

338
00:26:45,402 --> 00:26:46,283
Thank you, Mr. President.

339
00:26:46,303 --> 00:26:49,645
Thank you, Councilor Locren, for bringing this up.

340
00:26:50,506 --> 00:26:53,288
I, too, went to those meetings, and I think it's so important.

341
00:26:53,688 --> 00:26:55,409
I think we also visited that whole neighborhood.

342
00:26:56,053 --> 00:26:58,055
and visiting and looking into that.

343
00:26:58,075 --> 00:27:04,320
I believe that we also voted during budget time to approve some funding to increase.

344
00:27:04,961 --> 00:27:09,785
That would be something that if we can, to maybe help us where we are with those monies.

345
00:27:09,825 --> 00:27:11,366
Have they been expended?

346
00:27:11,586 --> 00:27:23,477
Are we putting, I believe that we were putting the, not the monuments, but there was the plaques at historical locations.

347
00:27:24,198 --> 00:27:24,978
I know that we were looking to.

348
00:27:24,998 --> 00:27:28,259
Typically, we have not provided plaques, but we can certainly do.

349
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:28,839
Excuse me.

350
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:30,200
Oh, sorry.

351
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,820
Let me introduce myself.

352
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:32,960
My name is Chris Bader.

353
00:27:33,241 --> 00:27:35,461
Name and address of the record, please.

354
00:27:35,481 --> 00:27:35,981
298 High Street.

355
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:44,564
I'm the chair of the Historic District Commission, and we're in charge of creating new historic districts.

356
00:27:44,924 --> 00:27:45,244
Sorry, Chris.

357
00:27:45,264 --> 00:27:51,946
And as you say, we should absolutely put a plaque indicating this is the King House

358
00:27:52,677 --> 00:27:56,460
with its construction date, approximate construction date of the 1840s.

359
00:27:57,081 --> 00:28:04,927
It's part of the historic, it's an important historic building in South Medford.

360
00:28:05,748 --> 00:28:15,516
And let me just give you a brief summary of the events that led to this becoming

361
00:28:17,743 --> 00:28:22,706
a candidate for her local historic district, which is that it was owned by Tufts University.

362
00:28:23,307 --> 00:28:40,077
And they kind of pulled a fast one on the grandfather's house, where they subdivided it with no public input, and then sold the entire property to a contractor, who immediately sold off grandfather's house itself and built a

363
00:28:43,871 --> 00:28:47,414
prefab house on the remaining property.

364
00:28:47,694 --> 00:28:49,616
And everyone was upset about that.

365
00:28:50,056 --> 00:28:54,600
Then they wanted to do exactly the same thing on 21 Turo.

366
00:28:54,620 --> 00:29:01,425
They had no intention of destroying the historic house, but they had their eye on that very juicy piece of property.

367
00:29:01,746 --> 00:29:04,308
The neighbors were outraged.

368
00:29:04,628 --> 00:29:10,212
It was really a grassroots uprising, you might even say.

369
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:24,000
And finally, the Tufts and the new perspective owner backed down and agreed to sell it to someone who agreed not to subdivide the property.

370
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:32,466
I think historic districts, part of our job is not just to preserve historic buildings, but to preserve open space.

371
00:29:33,327 --> 00:29:35,769
And a lot of these historic houses are on big lots.

372
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:39,051
And the neighbors want to keep it that way.

373
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:49,832
It was tentatively resolved with the new owners that they would put a historic preservation restriction on the deed.

374
00:29:50,593 --> 00:29:58,215
Now, the problem is this is a historic preservation deed of preservation restriction of limited duration.

375
00:29:59,515 --> 00:30:05,397
And moreover, the building department does not have easy access to preservation restrictions.

376
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:07,698
It's there at the registry of deeds.

377
00:30:08,527 --> 00:30:16,009
But it's not something there that a building inspector is going to be able to look at in a few minutes.

378
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:25,632
So we decided we would, in addition to the historic preservation restriction, we would seek local historical district status.

379
00:30:26,312 --> 00:30:32,974
We sent out, there's an elaborate process spelled out by the Mass Historical Commission, which we followed.

380
00:30:33,014 --> 00:30:35,094
It took about a year to actually get it through.

381
00:30:36,655 --> 00:30:37,695
We held a public hearing.

382
00:30:39,184 --> 00:30:42,765
We were actually amazed to find that no one opposed it, including the owners.

383
00:30:44,166 --> 00:30:45,506
In fact, they really were delighted.

384
00:30:47,106 --> 00:30:53,728
We held this public hearing after a 60-day waiting period and blah, blah, blah.

385
00:30:54,169 --> 00:30:58,490
And really, the last step is now for you guys to vote on it.

386
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:08,453
It requires per Massachusetts General Laws 40C, it requires a two-thirds vote of the

387
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:15,430
of the City Council, that means five of you guys, and we would appreciate your support.

388
00:31:17,411 --> 00:31:17,731
Thank you.

389
00:31:19,152 --> 00:31:19,692
Any questions?

390
00:31:21,073 --> 00:31:24,535
Councilor Dela Ruzzo.

391
00:31:24,815 --> 00:31:30,338
Tell me what this, in creation, this historic district at 21 Toro Ave.

392
00:31:30,738 --> 00:31:32,119
Yes.

393
00:31:32,239 --> 00:31:33,740
Define 21 Toro Ave.

394
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:38,162
It is the current, it is the house and the current property

395
00:31:39,367 --> 00:31:44,310
uh, that is in, that is registered at the registry of deeds as 21 Toro.

396
00:31:44,911 --> 00:31:53,937
So it is both, uh, this is not something that can be subdivided or built on without the permission of the historic district commission.

397
00:31:54,617 --> 00:31:54,977
Thank you.

398
00:31:55,618 --> 00:31:56,759
Chris, can you give me that one?

399
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:01,682
The, the law again, excuse me, the law again, 40 C what do you say?

400
00:32:01,902 --> 00:32:06,685
General master was 40 C. Yes.

401
00:32:06,725 --> 00:32:08,046
Point of information, Mr. President.

402
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:11,671
Councilor Del Rosso, point of information.

403
00:32:12,011 --> 00:32:15,695
Have we received any communique on this from the city solicitor?

404
00:32:16,596 --> 00:32:17,096
We have not.

405
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:22,861
The city solicitor has, has the habit of speaking for himself.

406
00:32:25,844 --> 00:32:33,751
He, he was, he basically, there was very basic language added to the existing bylaws of the city of Medford.

407
00:32:35,295 --> 00:32:41,760
in accordance with Master Enrollment 40C, and the city solicitor approved that language.

408
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:53,330
Basically, there's nothing in there besides adding the King House to the list of the other two historic districts in Medford.

409
00:32:54,611 --> 00:32:57,674
Otherwise, no changes whatsoever to the Medford bylaws.

410
00:33:00,236 --> 00:33:00,756
Councillor Knight.

411
00:33:02,017 --> 00:33:02,678
Mr. Bader, how are you?

412
00:33:03,376 --> 00:33:03,756
Good to see you.

413
00:33:03,776 --> 00:33:04,437
Good to see you.

414
00:33:04,657 --> 00:33:08,780
Um, all the procedural requirements have been met by the district commission.

415
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,722
So now right now, okay.

416
00:33:11,783 --> 00:33:20,209
And right now, um, this would bring this, if we take this to a vote this evening, it would bring this issue of 21 to wrap the finality and it would have its single home historic district classification.

417
00:33:20,629 --> 00:33:20,870
Yes.

418
00:33:22,531 --> 00:33:23,472
Mr. President, I move for approval.

419
00:33:24,072 --> 00:33:24,392
Thank you.

420
00:33:25,353 --> 00:33:26,154
Vice president box.

421
00:33:27,114 --> 00:33:27,875
Thank you, Mr. President.

422
00:33:28,782 --> 00:33:33,203
Do we do we have any other properties in the city that are in a similar circumstance?

423
00:33:34,283 --> 00:33:46,205
That are in immediate danger of subdivision As the reason for the developer buying them not that I'm aware of no There are of course historic houses all over Medford.

424
00:33:46,225 --> 00:33:56,607
They need protection and we're working on a plan to a general plan to protect these houses particularly those

425
00:33:58,341 --> 00:34:01,362
in close to Medford Square.

426
00:34:02,202 --> 00:34:09,083
For example, the Andrew House, the David Osgood House, which is owned by the Unitarian Church but is in very poor condition.

427
00:34:11,784 --> 00:34:15,745
And we don't think Grandfather's House is in any danger at this point.

428
00:34:15,765 --> 00:34:23,606
The damage has already been done with the construction of the prefab house that was built next to it.

429
00:34:25,447 --> 00:34:26,267
So we're focusing

430
00:34:27,279 --> 00:34:31,142
at the moment houses near, uh, uh, square.

431
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:37,888
And if the council were to vote on this tonight, do you know when it would become effective?

432
00:34:38,128 --> 00:34:42,331
Is it something that, uh, you would have to talk to the city solicitor about that.

433
00:34:42,491 --> 00:34:45,273
But, but I would believe it would be effective immediately.

434
00:34:45,434 --> 00:34:46,294
Effective immediately.

435
00:34:46,314 --> 00:34:46,474
Yes.

436
00:34:46,935 --> 00:34:47,175
Okay.

437
00:34:48,196 --> 00:34:49,217
I too would move approval.

438
00:34:49,237 --> 00:34:49,797
Mr. President.

439
00:34:51,979 --> 00:34:52,619
Councilor Falco.

440
00:34:52,759 --> 00:34:53,580
Thank you, Mr. President.

441
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,661
I just wanted to, uh,

442
00:34:55,137 --> 00:34:58,098
say thank you for your hard work on this and thank everyone here tonight.

443
00:34:58,418 --> 00:34:59,598
Um, I think this is important.

444
00:35:00,178 --> 00:35:01,878
Um, it's something I support wholeheartedly.

445
00:35:02,438 --> 00:35:07,779
Um, you know, we need to protect our historic homes and, um, I think this goes a long way in doing that.

446
00:35:07,879 --> 00:35:09,980
Hopefully we could probably see more of it too.

447
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:20,121
But, um, I think, um, you know, with developers coming in all the time trying to, you know, tear things down, you know, I think they're tearing apart our history and that's unfortunate and we need to do more.

448
00:35:20,761 --> 00:35:22,822
And, uh, I just want to thank you for all your efforts.

449
00:35:23,022 --> 00:35:23,562
Thank you so much.

450
00:35:24,369 --> 00:35:25,030
and move approval.

451
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:25,550
Thank you.

452
00:35:30,154 --> 00:35:40,602
On the motion by Councilor Lungo, on the motion by Councilor Lungo-Kernan, seconded by Councilor Falco, and this requires a two-third vote.

453
00:35:41,082 --> 00:35:42,864
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

454
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:51,310
Councilor DelaRusso?

455
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:51,451
Yes.

456
00:35:53,254 --> 00:35:53,894
Councilor Falco?

457
00:35:54,054 --> 00:35:54,315
Yes.

458
00:35:55,015 --> 00:35:55,515
Councilor Knight?

459
00:35:55,775 --> 00:35:56,015
Yes.

460
00:35:56,596 --> 00:35:57,316
Councilor Kern?

461
00:35:57,476 --> 00:35:57,596
Yes.

462
00:35:58,517 --> 00:35:59,297
Vice President Mox?

463
00:35:59,637 --> 00:35:59,877
Yes.

464
00:36:00,398 --> 00:36:01,158
Councilor Scarpelli?

465
00:36:01,258 --> 00:36:01,498
Yes.

466
00:36:03,019 --> 00:36:03,759
President Caviello?

467
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:04,540
Yes.

468
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,302
Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

469
00:36:08,762 --> 00:36:09,522
Motion passes.

470
00:36:09,702 --> 00:36:10,483
Congratulations.

471
00:36:10,503 --> 00:36:10,903
Thank you.

472
00:36:19,207 --> 00:36:20,348
While we're on the suspension, 17-371,

473
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:40,180
Offered by Councilor Lungo Kern, be it resolved that the Medford City Council move forward with extending the demolition delay of historic properties from six months to 18 months to 24 months by changing Chapter 48 of the City of Medford ordinances.

474
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,541
Councilor Lungo Kern.

475
00:36:43,002 --> 00:36:46,124
Thank you, President Carviello.

476
00:36:46,345 --> 00:36:51,309
Um, I know that the demo delay Chapter 48 isn't,

477
00:36:53,231 --> 00:37:12,280
subcommittee, so I'm not sure what councils have been able to read it, but I believe the commission and myself or whoever will be able to get a copy to anybody that hasn't, um, this proposal was voted in favor by the Medford historical commission and it is outlined in yellow.

478
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:17,903
Um, the version I have outlined in yellow with the potential changes.

479
00:37:18,633 --> 00:37:27,077
And obviously, one of the biggest changes is we currently have a six-month demo delay that has been around for quite some time.

480
00:37:27,817 --> 00:37:38,702
But times are changing, and a number of different communities are moving towards extending their demo delay or already have a 12-, 18-, or 24-month demo delay.

481
00:37:38,722 --> 00:37:45,765
I know that I believe Winchester's working on pushing it to a year.

482
00:37:45,865 --> 00:37:47,986
Watertown has 24 months, Somerville

483
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:50,571
has an extended demo delay.

484
00:37:50,651 --> 00:37:53,273
Lexington, Concord, they're at Woburn.

485
00:37:54,034 --> 00:37:58,617
There are a number of cities and towns around us that do have a demo delay.

486
00:38:01,099 --> 00:38:16,229
The commission in their annual report, Medford Historical Commission in their annual report, it shows 2016, the amount of demo delays is up, I don't know, would you say 90%?

487
00:38:19,059 --> 00:38:24,383
The norm was about one to two requests for a demolition of a historical property.

488
00:38:24,823 --> 00:38:31,387
This current ordinance we have is anything 1900 or above, built in 1900 or above.

489
00:38:33,029 --> 00:38:48,239
In 2016, not only were there 17 applications for demo delays, but the historic commission found that 17 properties were historically significant and preferably preserved.

490
00:38:48,803 --> 00:38:50,704
So I think that's an important factor.

491
00:38:50,744 --> 00:38:53,365
It goes to show that times really are changing.

492
00:38:53,785 --> 00:38:57,587
We've had uproar in the city over a number of different parcels.

493
00:38:59,048 --> 00:39:07,432
Walnut Street brings to mind what's been, as of recent, you have 18 Walnut Street, you have the property across the street.

494
00:39:08,092 --> 00:39:17,157
You also have a property that was listed, and I'm not gonna name the address, but it listed, and I believe it was listed on MLS, because I do have access to MLS,

495
00:39:18,012 --> 00:39:18,552
I did read it.

496
00:39:18,632 --> 00:39:25,893
I don't have it in front of me, but it was advertised as a single-family home that could be turned into four units.

497
00:39:26,694 --> 00:39:28,714
So that's a problem to the community.

498
00:39:28,774 --> 00:39:30,214
It's a problem to our neighborhoods.

499
00:39:31,114 --> 00:39:34,695
The residents in the community are not happy with the current state.

500
00:39:35,335 --> 00:39:40,476
And the six-month delay is not deterring what it used to deter.

501
00:39:42,056 --> 00:39:46,377
You can go over the Walnut Street property and what's going on there, and that gives you significant proof

502
00:39:47,128 --> 00:39:48,249
you know, what I just stated.

503
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:51,451
So why is the delay?

504
00:39:51,511 --> 00:39:55,693
And this is put, this is question and answers that have been put out by the historical commission.

505
00:39:56,133 --> 00:40:01,677
Why is the delay being changed from six months to 24 months or potentially why are we requesting that?

506
00:40:01,717 --> 00:40:03,598
Why am I asking the council to support this?

507
00:40:04,278 --> 00:40:08,661
Um, primarily because the commission has found that the present six month delay is not effective.

508
00:40:09,301 --> 00:40:15,025
The commission has seen numerous cases where owners or developers have showed no interest in working with either the commission

509
00:40:15,618 --> 00:40:24,243
or the neighborhood to look at alternatives to demolition and simply waited out the six-month demo delay time frame and demolished the property anyway.

510
00:40:25,243 --> 00:40:32,227
A larger potential demo delay time frame of up to 24 months is generally too long a time frame for a project to become dormant.

511
00:40:33,128 --> 00:40:39,391
And the commission feels that the extra time will give the demo delay some teeth and leverage that will serve Medford and our neighborhoods better.

512
00:40:41,673 --> 00:40:44,034
and why the changes are being proposed.

513
00:40:44,114 --> 00:40:52,938
And I just stated already over the last five minutes, there are several significant historic buildings that have been demoed.

514
00:40:53,779 --> 00:40:54,899
Residents have been upset.

515
00:40:55,319 --> 00:40:59,181
And as the real estate market continues to improve, no more vacant land exists.

516
00:40:59,321 --> 00:41:02,443
The threat of Medford's historic buildings is ever increasing.

517
00:41:02,983 --> 00:41:11,427
The proposed bylaws tries to address these concerns by providing time to research alternatives to demo before any more historic buildings are lost.

518
00:41:11,837 --> 00:41:20,199
It also clarifies previously undefined terms and creates a standard set of mandates for applicants to complete in order for the commission to lift the delay.

519
00:41:20,219 --> 00:41:24,220
I know we have a number of residents and we have Ryan Haywood.

520
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:32,703
I reached out to him last week after I got emails and phone calls from concerned residents on the Walnut Street property.

521
00:41:32,723 --> 00:41:36,884
And you see Facebook, there's a number of people that are interested in this.

522
00:41:37,064 --> 00:41:40,625
And I believe the time is now, whether we have a committee of the whole meeting,

523
00:41:41,175 --> 00:41:47,877
or we decide to move forward with this tonight, I think it's something that we need to move on quickly.

524
00:41:48,597 --> 00:42:08,784
Ryan was gracious enough to meet with me, and I know he'll meet with, or has met with other councilors as well to explain in depth what the ordinance entails, the proposed changes to it, how they will affect in more detail than I can give the community, and I think it's a win-win, and I think it's something that we need to discuss and move forward with.

525
00:42:10,322 --> 00:42:15,066
leave it to the people, the residents who are thankfully came tonight to support the paper.

526
00:42:15,506 --> 00:42:16,287
Thank you, Mr. President.

527
00:42:16,307 --> 00:42:19,429
Again, I thank a counselor longer current for bringing this forward.

528
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:24,674
Um, this is, this issue is, is greater than what it reads itself.

529
00:42:24,734 --> 00:42:32,460
I think that what we're seeing in our community with our questions and zoning and a lack of true development plan, I think is it,

530
00:42:33,499 --> 00:42:42,928
This one key issue really sums up what we're seeing as probably the number one now major issue and concern in our community.

531
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:54,139
I too was part of the subcommittee that saw this as an issue and moved it forward for 12 months with a possible another six months.

532
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:58,083
So looking at that 18 months, that's something we wholeheartedly supported.

533
00:42:58,547 --> 00:42:59,247
and subcommittee.

534
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:09,074
I think that it is still was brought back and then put to the city solicitor for final approval.

535
00:43:09,134 --> 00:43:23,563
I think that bringing this forward kind of gives you that kickstart that we need to get a final answer and whether it's in committee of the whole or in the open meetings to get this

536
00:43:24,025 --> 00:43:24,625
get this through.

537
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:37,113
I think it's very important because what we are seeing is free reign throughout our community and making sure right now, looking at a historical community and tying that

538
00:43:37,682 --> 00:43:42,264
And holding that off, where we have that control right now, I think is vital.

539
00:43:42,344 --> 00:43:46,166
So I appreciate my fellow council for bringing this up.

540
00:43:46,186 --> 00:43:54,511
I appreciate all the hard work and the emails that I did receive from multiple community members and concerns that were brought forth.

541
00:43:54,651 --> 00:44:00,874
I know that one member came behind this reel last week, and we had a depth conversation, because you can hear it in their voices.

542
00:44:01,714 --> 00:44:05,236
And when people seeing communities that

543
00:44:05,799 --> 00:44:10,963
that we know as of Medford changing right in front of your eyes and it looks like we have no control.

544
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:24,014
So I think this is a great resolution to at least put a stop to this right now and give us a little bit more control as we look into the zoning and development concerns that we do have for our community.

545
00:44:24,054 --> 00:44:28,718
So I wholeheartedly second this, this motion and moving this forward.

546
00:44:28,758 --> 00:44:30,079
So thank you.

547
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:31,480
Councilor Knight.

548
00:44:32,101 --> 00:44:33,422
Mr. President, thank you very much.

549
00:44:33,762 --> 00:44:34,963
Um, by way of history,

550
00:44:35,447 --> 00:44:39,870
I'd like to just give a, give a brief breakdown as to, um, the process in June of 2016.

551
00:44:40,151 --> 00:44:48,157
Um, the historical commission came before the council during budget hearings and express some concern about the demolition delay.

552
00:44:48,817 --> 00:45:00,326
Um, at that point in time, in June of 2016, uh, I was working on a proposal with Mr. Haywood based upon some recommendations that he had and council along go current put forward a resolution requesting that, um, the demolition delay be looked at.

553
00:45:01,166 --> 00:45:04,849
In June of 2016, that paper was referred to the zoning and ordinance committee

554
00:45:05,236 --> 00:45:09,197
and it was introduced by way of a subcommittee hearing language.

555
00:45:09,237 --> 00:45:23,139
Language was put together, and in August of 2016, the Zoning and Ordinance Subcommittee reported the following changes to 48-78B out of committee favorably for full review and vetting from the committee of the whole.

556
00:45:24,219 --> 00:45:34,141
The first recommendation that the subcommittee made was to strike the figure 1900 and replace that with homes built within the last 75 years, presently homes subject to demolition delay.

557
00:45:34,965 --> 00:45:42,372
have to have been built before the year 1900 and the recommendation of the subcommittee was to strike that and replace it with homes built within the last 75 years.

558
00:45:43,373 --> 00:45:56,765
Um, also the subcommittee, uh, agreed in their committee report, which was reported out favorably, um, underneath four eight dash seven eight B subsection H to strike the figure six months and replace it with the figure 12 months.

559
00:45:57,766 --> 00:46:00,909
And, uh, that would be the amount of time for which the demolition delay can take place.

560
00:46:01,627 --> 00:46:11,654
Um, also under section I two, um, would be strike six months and replaced with 12 months again, a housekeeping to ensure that, uh, the ordinance would reflect that demolition delay would be 12 months.

561
00:46:12,515 --> 00:46:24,884
Um, the subcommittee also recommended that a new section be added to four, eight dash seven, eight, um, which would allow for the historical commission to petition the city council for an additional six months of demolition delay.

562
00:46:25,404 --> 00:46:29,407
Um, if they felt certain requirements and criterias weren't met, this was,

563
00:46:31,528 --> 00:46:36,690
reported out of the committee in August of 2016 and set for a committee of the whole hearing.

564
00:46:37,970 --> 00:47:00,298
The matter was being scheduled for a committee of the whole hearing when the commission asked to hold off and presented us with a revamped ordinance that they wrote that was a little bit more than just increasing the number of years that it takes to make a house eligible for demolition delay and also increasing the amount of time for which they have to delay

565
00:47:01,122 --> 00:47:02,122
demolition of a house.

566
00:47:03,303 --> 00:47:07,704
So in October of 2016, the Historical Commission presented those changes to the subcommittee.

567
00:47:08,524 --> 00:47:16,146
And in October of 2016, the subcommittee requested some technical assistance relative to some questions that were raised relative to legalities.

568
00:47:16,906 --> 00:47:20,087
Those were sent to the Office of Community Development and the legal department.

569
00:47:21,307 --> 00:47:22,908
Those questions weren't answered.

570
00:47:22,968 --> 00:47:27,289
And in January 2017, there were some subcommittee changes with the change of the leadership to the president.

571
00:47:28,162 --> 00:47:50,311
So counselor Dela Rousseau for console Falco and counselor Me night now make up the committee in February of 2017 a meeting notice was posted to reconvene and discuss this matter where we had not received any response from the administration at which time the snowstorm struck and The meeting was canceled because City Hall was closed so that brings us to February 2017 mr. President so it appears that as of

572
00:47:55,299 --> 00:48:03,943
In August 2016, the subcommittee had reported out a paper favorably to the Committee of the Whole, and there is a paper that is now at the Committee of the Whole that would address this issue.

573
00:48:04,744 --> 00:48:12,008
The recommendations were to increase the number of years for which a home would be eligible for a demolition delay to be built within the last 75 years.

574
00:48:12,028 --> 00:48:20,692
It would also give a 12-month automatic demolition delay with the ability for the commission to petition this council for an opportunity for an additional six months, Mr. President.

575
00:48:23,516 --> 00:48:26,197
recommendations still remain on the table and can be brought up at any time.

576
00:48:26,217 --> 00:48:27,557
We can move forward on those tomorrow.

577
00:48:28,077 --> 00:48:39,581
Um, the proposed ordinance that the commission put together, um, was a little bit more inclusive than just addressing issues of time and of delay.

578
00:48:40,141 --> 00:48:42,742
Um, and there was a number of concerns that were raised by the subcommittee.

579
00:48:42,762 --> 00:48:48,884
The subcommittee, um, was waiting to get some answers back from the administration's legal team and community development team that hasn't happened.

580
00:48:48,924 --> 00:48:51,365
And we share the frustration that the individuals behind the rail share,

581
00:48:52,021 --> 00:49:03,668
However, if the matter is just as simple as increasing the number of years to look at a house and the amount of time to delay demolition, there's a paper that's sitting right in our Committee of the Whole right now that we can act on, Mr. President, and that will address that issue.

582
00:49:03,949 --> 00:49:06,430
And then we can go and continue to properly vet the proposals.

583
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:08,351
And that's the course of action that I would recommend.

584
00:49:08,852 --> 00:49:09,172
Thank you.

585
00:49:10,433 --> 00:49:11,193
Vice President Marks.

586
00:49:12,474 --> 00:49:13,474
Thank you, Mr. President.

587
00:49:13,775 --> 00:49:18,918
And, you know, this is such an important ordinance.

588
00:49:19,845 --> 00:49:29,850
And in my opinion, waiting for a legal opinion, waiting for the administration to move on something is long overdue.

589
00:49:30,890 --> 00:49:38,934
And I'd rather see something put forward and have us worry about maybe some ramifications down the line.

590
00:49:39,335 --> 00:49:43,456
I'd rather see some protections in place right now, Mr. President.

591
00:49:44,117 --> 00:49:46,478
And what makes this community so unique

592
00:49:47,374 --> 00:49:57,363
is the, and you hear it over and over again, is the very uniqueness of every neighborhood, Mr. President, and every style of home in this community.

593
00:49:57,923 --> 00:50:10,173
And slowly but surely, we're losing the style of this community to these large salt box type homes and condominium projects, Mr. President.

594
00:50:10,589 --> 00:50:17,673
all for the sake of adding additional units and additional money for the developers.

595
00:50:18,513 --> 00:50:28,259
And as was mentioned earlier, many of these older homes are on larger properties, like on Walnut, that have additional space.

596
00:50:28,839 --> 00:50:33,221
And the developers see this nothing more than a way of making additional money.

597
00:50:33,942 --> 00:50:36,263
And we as a community have to safeguard ourselves

598
00:50:36,673 --> 00:50:39,094
And I think this is a great step in the right direction.

599
00:50:39,114 --> 00:50:47,318
I'd rather see the 75 years extended to 100 years and beyond, to be quite honest with you.

600
00:50:48,418 --> 00:50:52,960
And the 12-month, in my opinion, is not long enough.

601
00:50:53,901 --> 00:51:03,725
I think what was offered as 18-month for a demolition delay, or even 24-month, at least provides this community with ample opportunity

602
00:51:04,215 --> 00:51:06,555
to safeguard its historic homes.

603
00:51:07,036 --> 00:51:10,936
So I personally would like to see us take a vote tonight.

604
00:51:10,976 --> 00:51:13,597
I think that's what Councilor Longo-Kern has requested.

605
00:51:14,297 --> 00:51:17,678
The resolve says from six months to 18 or 24.

606
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:23,099
I think we have to narrow it down naturally before we vote on it, because you can't have 18 or 24.

607
00:51:23,539 --> 00:51:24,599
It has to be one or the other.

608
00:51:25,539 --> 00:51:34,001
But I definitely think, and I'm prepared tonight to move this forward, Mr. President, because I've been around a while.

609
00:51:34,708 --> 00:51:41,733
And I'm not going to wait to hear with an opinion that may be rendered down the line that we've been waiting on already for six months.

610
00:51:42,574 --> 00:51:45,897
Um, because, uh, I, I rather move forward, Mr. President.

611
00:51:46,357 --> 00:51:50,520
Uh, this is long overdue and I would support, uh, the resolution tonight, Mr. President.

612
00:51:54,223 --> 00:51:54,523
Thank you.

613
00:51:54,583 --> 00:52:03,210
I want to get to, um, allow the speakers to speak, but I, I too would be agreeable to even if we vote for a demo delay,

614
00:52:03,942 --> 00:52:09,886
tonight, whether it be the 12 months that the committee discussed with an extension of six months or an 18 month demo delay.

615
00:52:09,906 --> 00:52:12,688
I think we should move forward on a vote like that tonight.

616
00:52:13,589 --> 00:52:16,070
And then we do have a number of other changes.

617
00:52:16,110 --> 00:52:22,455
Maybe we can meet in committee of the whole to discuss changing the ordinance completely, but I think we need to move forward on something.

618
00:52:22,535 --> 00:52:24,296
I think the votes may be here to do that.

619
00:52:24,316 --> 00:52:28,459
So I'd like to hear from the speakers and I'm agreeable to my colleagues.

620
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:30,300
Councilor DelaRusso.

621
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:31,101
Mr. President.

622
00:52:32,156 --> 00:52:36,360
If I could, through the chair, ask Councilor Knight again to restate his recommendation.

623
00:52:37,421 --> 00:52:44,747
I believe that he was suggesting that we had something in Committee of the Whole, and we have two contrasting things.

624
00:52:44,787 --> 00:52:47,089
So I just want some clarity, if I could.

625
00:52:49,051 --> 00:52:56,057
The recommendation of the subcommittee coming out of the August subcommittee report, which was favorable and unanimous,

626
00:52:56,636 --> 00:52:58,578
would be to strike the figure 1900.

627
00:52:58,698 --> 00:53:02,341
Right now it said any home built before 1900 was subject to a demolition delay.

628
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:05,984
We wanted to reduce that figure to any home built within the last 75 years.

629
00:53:06,024 --> 00:53:08,927
That was the recommendation of the committee that was reported out favorably.

630
00:53:09,648 --> 00:53:14,792
That's subsection B under ordinance 48-78.

631
00:53:14,912 --> 00:53:19,897
We also have the opportunity to strike the figure six months and replace it with 12 months.

632
00:53:20,137 --> 00:53:23,680
And that was a reference to the amount of time for which the demolition delay would be in effect.

633
00:53:24,209 --> 00:53:26,510
That's under 48-78H.

634
00:53:27,831 --> 00:53:36,416
And we also have a reference to six months in 48-78I subsection two, which also made a reference to a six month demolition delay.

635
00:53:36,716 --> 00:53:40,378
And the recommendation of the committee was to strike that and replace it with 12 months.

636
00:53:40,778 --> 00:53:51,524
So the committee made an initial recommendation to change the purview of homes that are subject to a demolition delay from houses that were built before 1900 to houses that were built within the last 75 years.

637
00:53:51,564 --> 00:53:53,785
So that will be a rolling scale.

638
00:53:54,384 --> 00:53:57,365
Um, we also agreed to give a 12 month demolition delay.

639
00:53:58,165 --> 00:54:06,926
And then there was new language that was reported out favorably, which said that, um, the commission would have the right to petition the city council for a delay of an additional six months.

640
00:54:06,946 --> 00:54:11,147
So that would give us 18 months of demolition delay if they could show that certain criteria weren't met.

641
00:54:11,567 --> 00:54:13,827
And that was the recommendation that was reported out of the subcommittee.

642
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:23,249
And that, uh, if I could, again, through the chair, that was all agreed to or arrived at with input from the commission and also, uh, the city solicitor.

643
00:54:23,846 --> 00:54:24,386
At Alia?

644
00:54:25,707 --> 00:54:28,248
That is correct, Mr. President, Councilor de la Russo.

645
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:31,329
The commission and the council met on that.

646
00:54:31,449 --> 00:54:36,792
The language changes were minor in nature and didn't raise any question or concern about legality.

647
00:54:37,412 --> 00:54:47,677
When we started getting into a two-year demolition delay and some of the changes that were in place, some concerns came up relative to whether or not there would be legal standing as to whether or not that was a land taking.

648
00:54:48,937 --> 00:54:52,919
Some questions and concerns about financing of projects and stuff, stuff that really,

649
00:54:53,803 --> 00:54:56,886
I think warranted concern, but not stuff that should be a deal breaker.

650
00:54:57,887 --> 00:54:58,247
Number one.

651
00:54:58,267 --> 00:55:07,775
Number two, I think that, you know, moving forward, we have some recommendations from the subcommittee that met that are sitting on the table at the committee of the whole that will address the issues in the ordinance that are brought forward.

652
00:55:07,835 --> 00:55:17,244
They will extend the demolition delay period of time from six months to 18 months or a year guaranteed and potentially 18 months if need be.

653
00:55:17,384 --> 00:55:19,886
And it will also change the type of home.

654
00:55:20,290 --> 00:55:21,750
that is subject to a demolition delay.

655
00:55:21,830 --> 00:55:23,911
And that's something that I could support this evening, Mr. President.

656
00:55:23,991 --> 00:55:31,333
I have the subsections and the languages, uh, the language, um, performing this evening and I'm writing it up, uh, right now for the city clerk and I'll present that by way of emotion.

657
00:55:31,633 --> 00:55:31,913
Thank you.

658
00:55:31,973 --> 00:55:43,737
And so if I could, so then if I remember correctly, we were prepared to have committed the whole meeting on those proposals, uh, yet we're asked not to buy the commission.

659
00:55:44,257 --> 00:55:48,418
So they had additional, uh, additional items that they wanted to put on.

660
00:55:50,814 --> 00:55:57,279
And then once we got those, the sequence events happened that we haven't met.

661
00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:01,022
Mr. President, I'm not prepared to vote on this tonight.

662
00:56:01,222 --> 00:56:09,228
I think we need to sort out what has to be done, do that in the Committee of the Whole, at your discretion, Mr. President.

663
00:56:09,728 --> 00:56:13,171
And also have the assistance, the paper was reported out to Committee of the Whole.

664
00:56:13,943 --> 00:56:20,186
And I have the assistance of the city solicitor present with us to lend his expertise.

665
00:56:21,787 --> 00:56:27,110
I'm not at this point asking to table.

666
00:56:27,630 --> 00:56:31,772
I will not support the motion that's before us to vote and approve this.

667
00:56:32,272 --> 00:56:43,338
I'm not going to support an ordinance change without three readings until we have clear language and the opportunity to come to clarity on this.

668
00:56:44,005 --> 00:56:45,105
with the papers before us.

669
00:56:45,225 --> 00:56:45,565
Thank you.

670
00:56:46,726 --> 00:56:47,426
Counselor Falco.

671
00:56:48,126 --> 00:56:48,806
Thank you, Mr. President.

672
00:56:48,826 --> 00:56:59,189
I just wanted to, uh, just go on the record of, um, you know, I was a member of the subcommittee that has been, um, that met with the commission and, uh, has been working on the ordinance changes.

673
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:02,710
I mean, I definitely support, uh, you know, updating the ordinance.

674
00:57:02,790 --> 00:57:05,750
I think we need to do more to protect, protect our historic homes.

675
00:57:05,830 --> 00:57:12,812
I mean, you know, as, as time goes on and we see these homes disappear, it really, uh, you know, has a negative impact on the,

676
00:57:13,137 --> 00:57:16,579
it really changes the fabric of our neighborhoods and we need to do more.

677
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:27,107
Um, you know, the, the, the, the subcommittee has been working, um, to actually make changes to the resolution, uh, to the, uh, ordinance to actually do more to protect historic homes.

678
00:57:27,407 --> 00:57:30,469
And, uh, so far, I mean, I know we've been working hard on that.

679
00:57:30,509 --> 00:57:32,130
We've been working hard with the commission.

680
00:57:32,590 --> 00:57:36,533
Um, and I do support extending the, uh, demolition delay as well.

681
00:57:36,653 --> 00:57:40,236
So I just want to go on the record of saying that, but, um, I do support this resolution.

682
00:57:40,376 --> 00:57:40,636
Thank you.

683
00:57:45,106 --> 00:57:45,867
Are you good?

684
00:57:46,067 --> 00:57:46,247
Yes.

685
00:57:46,267 --> 00:57:46,848
Thank you.

686
00:57:46,868 --> 00:57:49,030
Name and address of the record, please.

687
00:57:49,370 --> 00:57:57,218
It's Ryan Hayward, 40 Sheridan Ave, Medford, uh, counselors and friends of Medford history promise to be succinct tonight.

688
00:57:57,778 --> 00:58:09,109
Tonight I stand before you as the chairman of the Medford historical commission where the official municipal bodies charged with the preservation, promotion and development of historical assets of our hometown.

689
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:15,155
One of the many ways we accomplish our mission is by administering the demo delay, which is before you tonight.

690
00:58:15,676 --> 00:58:18,799
And it was adopted in 1994 by this very board.

691
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:24,584
It was established for protecting the city's significant historical, cultural, and architectural buildings.

692
00:58:24,824 --> 00:58:30,690
And if invoked, the delay period is a maximum currently of six months and only applicable to buildings built before 1900.

693
00:58:30,870 --> 00:58:33,272
The intent of this pause

694
00:58:34,187 --> 00:58:39,911
is so that the applicant can make reasonable, continued, and bona fide efforts to save the irreplaceable asset.

695
00:58:40,652 --> 00:58:44,875
In most cases, however, the commission has found that the existing bylaw is ineffective.

696
00:58:48,497 --> 00:58:53,441
And the commission has found that we have little influence over the course of action.

697
00:58:53,641 --> 00:58:58,244
Scores of developers, absentee landlords, neglectful property owners,

698
00:58:58,632 --> 00:59:04,717
and profit seekers have chosen to wait out that short timeline and even build it into their schedules at this point.

699
00:59:05,678 --> 00:59:10,462
We have found that there is an unsettling trend towards demolition rather than renovation.

700
00:59:11,043 --> 00:59:17,729
Applications have tripled in the last three years alone, and many of these were notable landmarks that we knew and loved.

701
00:59:18,956 --> 00:59:23,878
The time now is to overhaul this bylaw and make it an effective preservation tool.

702
00:59:24,258 --> 00:59:39,803
Through Councilor Knight and now through Councilor Longo-Cohen, I respectfully request that the City Council immediately move forward with the demolition delay revision of Chapter 48, Article 4, as presented in subcommittee to the demo delay subcommittee last September.

703
00:59:39,883 --> 00:59:43,144
This is not the original bylaw that was proposed before that.

704
00:59:43,545 --> 00:59:47,386
I respectfully disagree with Councilor Knight that the commission had no input on that.

705
00:59:47,918 --> 00:59:52,261
And then, unfortunately, we got word after the fact that that subcommittee did vote.

706
00:59:52,361 --> 00:59:55,463
And so we put forth our own proposal, which went to subcommittee.

707
00:59:58,345 --> 01:00:04,229
Highlights of these changes include much needed revisions to the definitions, changes to the reviews and timeline.

708
01:00:04,577 --> 01:00:15,764
including buildings that are 50 years old to be in compliance with our certified local government status and the national park service, including language to discourage demolition by neglect.

709
01:00:15,884 --> 01:00:25,330
And most importantly, changing the timeline from six months to two years to give this board the leverage it needs to influence projects involving our historic buildings.

710
01:00:26,271 --> 01:00:31,094
By extending the demo delay, we will join scores of other communities that have said yes to better projects,

711
01:00:31,604 --> 01:00:37,127
Yes to preservation and yes to ensuring that we have something to leave behind for the next generation.

712
01:00:37,747 --> 01:00:48,493
I look to you all for your support as it should be clear that you have our support and I'm happy to answer any questions that you guys have on this as you guys move forward in process.

713
01:00:49,954 --> 01:00:54,636
Just to be clear too, the question was raised about properties that were up for demolition.

714
01:00:54,976 --> 01:00:59,959
I mentioned in my annual report that I will have sent to the mayor tomorrow

715
01:01:00,882 --> 01:01:03,987
There were 18 properties that came under review last year.

716
01:01:04,408 --> 01:01:07,573
Only six of them fell under the demolition delay, but we reviewed.

717
01:01:09,415 --> 01:01:15,097
I reviewed personally at least double that amount that were not applicable to the review, unfortunately.

718
01:01:15,177 --> 01:01:19,539
So we're losing buildings on a month-to-month basis, and sometimes more than that.

719
01:01:20,140 --> 01:01:32,865
There are six buildings that have already come up, two of which are currently going through the process of demo delay review, one on Codding Street, one on Walnut Street, which is just coming up for the first leg.

720
01:01:33,533 --> 01:01:40,355
And then there's, I've heard, gotten word that there's another building just down the street from the other Codding Street building, which is currently under review.

721
01:01:40,695 --> 01:01:51,978
So there are several buildings which are coming up and just being bought, all of which have been owned by long-time owners, absentee landlords at this point, or have approached owners to sell their historic buildings.

722
01:01:52,098 --> 01:01:56,960
So this is an ever-increasing problem that I see will not be going away in the near future.

723
01:01:57,100 --> 01:02:01,521
So by changing this bylaw and doing it right now and doing it once,

724
01:02:01,943 --> 01:02:09,469
And being all-inclusive, it will afford us some time to be able to continue to influence projects in lieu of zoning until you guys are ready to change zoning.

725
01:02:12,872 --> 01:02:13,672
Councilor Longo-Kurin.

726
01:02:13,813 --> 01:02:15,074
Thank you, President Carviello.

727
01:02:15,334 --> 01:02:18,777
Thank you for your, um, for coming tonight and explaining that to the council.

728
01:02:19,237 --> 01:02:26,743
If I could ask you a question with regards to reviewing the entire ordinance and committee of the whole within the next month or two, um, if we wait,

729
01:02:27,145 --> 01:02:33,408
to put a demo delay and we don't vote on it tonight, what does that mean if it's postponed one, two, three, four months?

730
01:02:33,648 --> 01:02:40,852
There's going to be additional demo requests that are going to get grandfathered in and we're not going to be able to stop it.

731
01:02:40,912 --> 01:02:41,272
Correct.

732
01:02:41,312 --> 01:02:47,835
I think you're going to find that there's going to be one of these huge rushes on demolition that anybody who might be even whispering or thinking demolition

733
01:02:48,511 --> 01:02:49,972
will put forth an application.

734
01:02:50,312 --> 01:02:57,074
Long-time owners who might be thinking of selling will probably put forth an application just so that they can clear the table and clear the hurdle long before.

735
01:02:57,474 --> 01:03:01,676
Because right now, there is no limit on the timeline of determination.

736
01:03:01,736 --> 01:03:09,818
So once we make a determination on whether a building is or isn't, unless there's significant reason to change that finding, it's a forever decision.

737
01:03:09,998 --> 01:03:14,140
So people can wait out the six-month delay the moment that they have it.

738
01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:17,241
And even if they're not selling, then sell the building is a vacant lot.

739
01:03:17,870 --> 01:03:19,254
So there is no recourse.

740
01:03:19,835 --> 01:03:23,686
And just to make it clear, you don't have a developer

741
01:03:25,012 --> 01:03:30,515
the property to put in a demo delay, they just have to get approval and signature by the current owner, isn't that correct?

742
01:03:30,575 --> 01:03:31,015
Correct.

743
01:03:31,556 --> 01:03:46,863
In the current case of 18 Walnut, which is coming up for review, the developer is acting as the owner's representative, and I have received a letter of approval from the current building owner, giving him permission to apply for demolition.

744
01:03:47,203 --> 01:03:50,525
So even before he owns the property, an applicant can

745
01:03:51,124 --> 01:03:58,889
you know, apply for the demolition and then just wait it out and have an active purchase and sales agreement and then move forward with a vacant lot as soon as they're ready.

746
01:04:00,050 --> 01:04:11,377
As one, one counselor to the chair, I don't see any reason why we can't vote to increase the demo delay tonight, especially where committees reviewed it and move forward with recommendations.

747
01:04:11,737 --> 01:04:20,403
Um, as well as in addition, I'd like to amend my resolve to include that any property 75 years or older be, um, by,

748
01:04:21,503 --> 01:04:30,789
75 years or 75 years or older as the committee, um, discussed and reviewed and put forward, um, that that be reviewable by the historic commission.

749
01:04:32,250 --> 01:04:32,610
Thank you.

750
01:04:35,211 --> 01:04:35,592
I'm sorry.

751
01:04:35,612 --> 01:04:36,272
I missed it.

752
01:04:36,492 --> 01:04:37,853
Are you asking me if it's revealed?

753
01:04:37,893 --> 01:04:38,353
Okay.

754
01:04:38,613 --> 01:04:38,914
Thank you.

755
01:04:38,954 --> 01:04:39,214
Okay.

756
01:04:39,374 --> 01:04:39,854
Anything else?

757
01:04:41,035 --> 01:04:41,335
Thank you.

758
01:04:41,475 --> 01:04:41,855
Thank you.

759
01:04:44,637 --> 01:04:45,698
Name and address of the record, please.

760
01:04:46,238 --> 01:04:46,478
Yes.

761
01:04:46,798 --> 01:04:49,260
Doug Carr, one 24 Boston Avenue, West Benefit.

762
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:50,961
I serve and have served with Ryan.

763
01:04:51,727 --> 01:04:53,848
on the historic commission for the past four years.

764
01:04:54,628 --> 01:04:55,628
I want to echo what he said.

765
01:04:55,668 --> 01:05:04,930
It's been really, um, a snowballing effect in the city of Medford in the last couple of years as these properties, um, have come one after another.

766
01:05:05,390 --> 01:05:13,652
And it's been a challenge for us because we haven't had the tools we need to protect the resources that we know we want to preserve for the longterm.

767
01:05:14,393 --> 01:05:17,593
And I would recommend, um, that 12 months is not enough.

768
01:05:17,613 --> 01:05:18,694
18 is a minimum.

769
01:05:18,934 --> 01:05:19,654
24 is preferred.

770
01:05:20,475 --> 01:05:27,439
Keep in mind that the commission, at any time during that period, can reduce that if they're getting cooperation with the developer.

771
01:05:28,059 --> 01:05:29,580
It's not all inclusive.

772
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:32,381
If they decide to save the building, we can immediately end it or amend it.

773
01:05:32,401 --> 01:05:36,764
Or if they decide to renovate or add on to the building, there's ways that we can reduce it.

774
01:05:36,804 --> 01:05:37,964
But it gives us that leverage.

775
01:05:38,725 --> 01:05:41,686
The leverage is the key with this thing, because we have virtually no leverage.

776
01:05:41,726 --> 01:05:44,948
If somebody comes in on September, the demo delay

777
01:05:45,578 --> 01:05:48,439
All they're doing is waiting out the winter, which they're not going to build anyway, most of the time.

778
01:05:48,479 --> 01:05:51,360
So it really is meaningless for a lot of developers if they time it right.

779
01:05:52,540 --> 01:06:00,582
So I think that's really important that it's truly a minimum of 18, preferably 24, and that we execute this as quickly as possible.

780
01:06:01,322 --> 01:06:06,483
I would like to echo something that one of the councilors said earlier, that we're really missing.

781
01:06:06,703 --> 01:06:09,124
This is a first piece of several pieces.

782
01:06:09,304 --> 01:06:12,525
You're missing a lot of pieces when it comes to planning in the city of Medford.

783
01:06:13,424 --> 01:06:17,726
You don't have any design review in Medford for any building under 10,000 square feet.

784
01:06:18,366 --> 01:06:21,907
So you can't control anything about a new building.

785
01:06:22,608 --> 01:06:24,088
You have no tools in which to do that.

786
01:06:24,408 --> 01:06:26,449
And this has been brought before the council many years ago.

787
01:06:27,229 --> 01:06:28,230
It didn't go anywhere.

788
01:06:28,530 --> 01:06:33,972
But I think the effort needs to be revived because design review is something that a lot of cities and towns have.

789
01:06:34,432 --> 01:06:36,233
It gets a higher quality development.

790
01:06:37,169 --> 01:06:40,630
It forces developers who would put cookie-cutter buildings to not do that.

791
01:06:41,330 --> 01:06:49,711
And one of our developers who's put up buildings, they're just taking a building they've built anywhere and plopping it down in every neighborhood they can.

792
01:06:49,731 --> 01:06:55,432
It has nothing to do with the character, context, or anything about the quality of the neighborhood.

793
01:06:56,112 --> 01:06:57,393
We can't prevent that right now.

794
01:06:57,433 --> 01:07:02,794
So you need to look at demo, not only demo delay, but design review as well, which has been long overdue in the city of Medford.

795
01:07:04,134 --> 01:07:05,454
Another thing that's missing here,

796
01:07:06,727 --> 01:07:07,767
is planning capacity.

797
01:07:08,128 --> 01:07:11,189
We don't have enough planning capacity in Medford.

798
01:07:11,869 --> 01:07:13,010
I know Lauren and Claude upstairs.

799
01:07:13,030 --> 01:07:13,930
I've known them for 20 years.

800
01:07:13,970 --> 01:07:18,012
They do wonderful work, but they do not have enough people to do what they need to do.

801
01:07:18,952 --> 01:07:21,733
We need a complete rewrite of zoning right now in the city of Medford.

802
01:07:21,773 --> 01:07:28,456
That's why every project in the city needs multiple variances, because we have zoning that has frozen in time in 1960.

803
01:07:28,836 --> 01:07:34,198
You need 2.1 cars, whether you're 100 feet from a T station or two miles from a T station.

804
01:07:34,827 --> 01:07:38,749
So the planning aspect of the city is just completely outdated.

805
01:07:38,769 --> 01:07:42,531
And I know the council has voted monies to increase the staff in last year's budget.

806
01:07:43,311 --> 01:07:44,832
But as of right now, that hasn't happened.

807
01:07:45,492 --> 01:07:48,113
So the planning capacity of Medford is critical.

808
01:07:48,233 --> 01:07:58,838
And I found it frankly embarrassing that the master plan for the city of Medford, which is now 12 years old and largely unexecuted, we still can't get to this day.

809
01:07:58,878 --> 01:08:03,961
We're executing little pieces of it here and there with grants rather than with in-house planning and expertise.

810
01:08:04,605 --> 01:08:21,877
So planning is the umbrella and zoning demo delay is one of these components, but there are two or three other legs of the stool that will help Medford get a higher quality built environment, preserve our historic architecture and give us a better quality of new construction across the board.

811
01:08:22,418 --> 01:08:29,003
So I urge you all to pass this as quickly as possible, 18 or 24 months, but then start addressing the other concerns as well.

812
01:08:29,343 --> 01:08:29,663
Thank you.

813
01:08:30,424 --> 01:08:30,764
Thank you.

814
01:08:36,092 --> 01:08:37,152
Name, address, and the record, please.

815
01:08:37,512 --> 01:08:39,213
Jean Nuzzo, 35 Parris Street.

816
01:08:39,413 --> 01:08:40,073
I apologize.

817
01:08:40,093 --> 01:08:41,053
I have a bit of a cold.

818
01:08:42,814 --> 01:08:49,875
So being an owner's project manager in construction and development, I work in facts.

819
01:08:50,536 --> 01:08:58,538
And I have a few facts that I'd like to put before you for consideration as you think about this demo delay and development in the city of Medford.

820
01:08:59,738 --> 01:09:03,679
Currently, today, the city of Medford has 13 properties

821
01:09:05,023 --> 01:09:07,727
listed for sale, 13, that's it.

822
01:09:09,028 --> 01:09:15,937
Of those 13, three are in condo complexes that were designed to be condo complexes.

823
01:09:17,214 --> 01:09:21,939
Four are two-family or three-family homes that have been condoized.

824
01:09:23,341 --> 01:09:28,086
And the remaining eight are listed single or two-family.

825
01:09:28,687 --> 01:09:35,835
Of those eight, four are listed with some variation of attention developers and contractors.

826
01:09:37,116 --> 01:09:38,597
So that's what's going on in our city.

827
01:09:39,277 --> 01:09:56,309
It is being positioned and sold as a place where some person, male or female, with a truck, some tools, and some capital, can come in here, quickly pick up a property, and do whatever they want with it.

828
01:09:57,390 --> 01:09:59,191
That's what's happening in the city of Medford.

829
01:10:00,839 --> 01:10:08,527
Another pertinent point of information that I think you need to understand and consider is what our price-to-rent ratio is in Medford.

830
01:10:08,607 --> 01:10:10,129
Well, what's a price-to-rent ratio?

831
01:10:11,030 --> 01:10:22,502
It's where you take the value of a property that's for sale, put it over the rent times 12 months a year.

832
01:10:23,700 --> 01:10:26,022
The city of Medford right now sits roughly at 17.4.

833
01:10:26,643 --> 01:10:33,348
There are four cities in the state of Massachusetts that are higher than Medford.

834
01:10:33,989 --> 01:10:38,453
Beacon Hill, the Back Bay, the South End, and South Boston.

835
01:10:39,053 --> 01:10:42,876
Cambridge and Somerville are irrelevant because they have been gentrified.

836
01:10:43,376 --> 01:10:45,358
This is a measure of gentrification.

837
01:10:46,018 --> 01:10:47,419
What is gentrification?

838
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:56,086
It is that mechanism that pushes the people who live in a city out because they can cease to afford to live here.

839
01:10:58,132 --> 01:11:20,717
That mechanism that takes potentially a resident who lives in a historic building and encourages them to sell because of what's happening around them and the recognition that their taxes are going to get to the point where they're not going to be able to afford to live in the city that they have raised a family in and chosen to stay in and potentially to age and place in.

840
01:11:21,517 --> 01:11:33,927
So, this measurement, the four cities that are above us, I want you to think about, Back Bay, South Boston, Beacon Hill, those are some pretty significant price point opportunities.

841
01:11:34,588 --> 01:11:36,850
And I don't discourage those types of price points.

842
01:11:37,190 --> 01:11:42,715
I think in the nature of real estate, they're critical, but we're getting a false inflation

843
01:11:43,115 --> 01:11:56,745
that's happening here because we're losing our two-family and three-family homes, which are a mechanism for young families and individuals to buy a piece of property and be able to afford it because of the rental capacity.

844
01:11:57,972 --> 01:12:17,278
What's critical about this is that these two-family and three-family projects that these, quote, developers, or as I call them, flippers, come in, they come in and they buy that property, and because it's less than 10 units, they're not required to put in any affordable housing.

845
01:12:18,178 --> 01:12:19,660
So they're making all profit.

846
01:12:20,321 --> 01:12:32,154
So there's a misnomer that this development is going to benefit our housing market and drop the value of property so that it's affordable because we're going to increase our stock.

847
01:12:33,015 --> 01:12:49,552
simply not going to happen by converting two families and three families and parceling off double lots and making exceptions for non-conforming units to put in another two-family or three-family, because those developers are not going to sell it at an affordable rate.

848
01:12:49,833 --> 01:12:50,994
That's not what's happening.

849
01:12:51,174 --> 01:12:52,796
That's not what's going to happen.

850
01:12:53,396 --> 01:12:55,238
Not unless we make a decision.

851
01:12:55,999 --> 01:13:09,249
We as a city voted, tonight you as a committee voted, to affirm the appointments of a CPA that is looking, as part of their process, to preserve both building and green space.

852
01:13:09,769 --> 01:13:17,815
And yet we continue to allow, quote, developers to come in and parcel our large lots and put

853
01:13:19,976 --> 01:13:31,700
Fast prefab Fabricated in a factory somewhere building that is a fraction of what they would pay for stick build construction They're not bringing jobs.

854
01:13:32,021 --> 01:13:41,264
They're simply lining their pockets in my opinion and my observation so I think that there's a message that can be sent here tonight by this committee and

855
01:13:41,804 --> 01:13:44,426
And the message is, the line is drawn.

856
01:13:45,007 --> 01:13:57,097
We welcome developers, but we welcome developers that come with a purpose, that come with a desire to collaborate, and that want to improve the city as well as make a profit.

857
01:13:57,397 --> 01:14:02,942
And I think the fastest way to send that message is to say, yes, no more six months.

858
01:14:03,523 --> 01:14:04,524
Now it's 12, it's 18, it's 24.

859
01:14:04,724 --> 01:14:05,665
It's 12 with two options.

860
01:14:08,627 --> 01:14:15,349
whatever, but I would encourage you to do it because tonight is an opportunity to send one of two messages.

861
01:14:16,010 --> 01:14:29,514
That we're here and as a city we're going to stand and support our history and the culture that we want to develop as a group or we're going to sit aside and we're going to let people who are here to make a profit take advantage of us.

862
01:14:30,035 --> 01:14:30,735
Thank you for your time.

863
01:14:39,148 --> 01:14:40,268
Name and address of the record, please.

864
01:14:40,588 --> 01:14:40,788
Yes.

865
01:14:41,128 --> 01:14:43,749
Uh, Chris Bader again, uh, Trinity high street.

866
01:14:44,249 --> 01:14:45,909
I'm the chair of the historic district commission.

867
01:14:46,369 --> 01:14:59,292
Um, I just wanted to say that the historic district commission, which of course is rather confusingly separate from the historical commission, uh, voted unanimously at our last meeting to support this resolution.

868
01:14:59,692 --> 01:15:03,033
And, um, uh, I would ask you, I would ask you for your support as well.

869
01:15:04,193 --> 01:15:04,473
Thank you.

870
01:15:09,275 --> 01:15:10,416
May I have the address of the record, please?

871
01:15:10,916 --> 01:15:14,518
Tom Lincoln, 27 Gleason Street in sunny Medford.

872
01:15:14,558 --> 01:15:15,199
Well, it's not sunny.

873
01:15:16,119 --> 01:15:25,665
I've been heavily involved in historic preservation and related issues with the Royal House and the slave quarters, of course, and the Brooks Estate, as well as other projects.

874
01:15:26,466 --> 01:15:29,528
My wife and I moved here close to 30 years ago.

875
01:15:29,568 --> 01:15:30,208
It's hard to believe.

876
01:15:31,569 --> 01:15:35,952
And one reason, one big reason, is the historical fabric of the city.

877
01:15:36,596 --> 01:15:45,242
And unfortunately, in that period, we've seen some fairly regrettable losses of historical fabric and architectural fabric.

878
01:15:46,463 --> 01:15:49,425
It's not to say that every building deserves to be saved.

879
01:15:50,706 --> 01:15:52,087
We do live in a capitalist.

880
01:15:52,628 --> 01:15:53,028
Excuse me?

881
01:15:56,118 --> 01:15:58,421
I gave the gentleman his due respect at the podium.

882
01:15:58,501 --> 01:15:58,821
Sorry.

883
01:15:59,482 --> 01:16:13,480
That every building deserves to be saved, but certainly there needs to be a process where we can have careful consideration, use some creativity, encourage outside money or inside money and developers to do the

884
01:16:14,634 --> 01:16:18,236
the right thing for neighborhoods and for our heritage.

885
01:16:18,536 --> 01:16:24,118
It's always true that once you lose an old building, it's not coming back.

886
01:16:24,558 --> 01:16:40,926
So I commend the council for bringing up this issue for the various boards that have advanced this cause and hope that you will extend the demolition delay period and provide other

887
01:16:42,389 --> 01:16:45,930
means for advancing this important issue.

888
01:16:46,011 --> 01:16:46,311
Thanks.

889
01:16:47,411 --> 01:16:47,731
Thank you.

890
01:16:52,413 --> 01:16:53,514
Name and address of the record, please.

891
01:16:53,594 --> 01:16:55,714
Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass.

892
01:16:55,875 --> 01:16:57,315
Former member of the circus party.

893
01:16:57,695 --> 01:17:01,317
You know, a city that forgets about its history won't have any history.

894
01:17:02,017 --> 01:17:11,541
And at the rate we're going in the city right now, the way developers have this opportunity to come in here, seize a piece of property, build upon it, and then take off and make a profit on it.

895
01:17:12,401 --> 01:17:14,663
perfect example is Luminaires on Locust Street.

896
01:17:15,483 --> 01:17:19,667
Puts the building up, he's there a year, sells it for $61 million, and he's gone.

897
01:17:20,507 --> 01:17:23,169
But we're talking about something right now is the history of our city.

898
01:17:24,310 --> 01:17:30,855
And while Councilman Uncle Kern brings up this issue, whether it be 18 to 24 months, for which I would prefer 24, think of it like this.

899
01:17:31,496 --> 01:17:40,443
Within the past three years, you folks in a concentrated area of South Street, Toro Ave, and Walnut Street have seen historical pieces of property

900
01:17:41,068 --> 01:17:48,595
and trees, if you're a lover of trees, and trees be demolished by out-of-towners, outsiders.

901
01:17:49,015 --> 01:18:01,806
People are only here to do one thing, and that's to make a profit on the piece of property and beg upon the people to maybe sell their property, make a big profit, and leave town so they can take over, make some money, and they can leave.

902
01:18:01,886 --> 01:18:02,467
It's not right.

903
01:18:03,147 --> 01:18:08,332
We heard one of your counselors indicate that the last time you people submitted a report in October,

904
01:18:08,905 --> 01:18:12,529
It went from October to January, and then it got lost somewhere in translation.

905
01:18:13,410 --> 01:18:21,618
That, in and of itself, is the telltale sign of what this city administration thinks about preserving its history, preserving the history of neighborhoods.

906
01:18:22,359 --> 01:18:30,988
And speaking about neighborhoods, when you lose zoning in your neighborhoods, whether it's for an historical purpose or what have you, you've lost the character of your neighborhood.

907
01:18:31,989 --> 01:18:50,799
South Boston, if you've been following this for the last two weeks, is a perfect example where the residents have gotten together on the development of a gentleman who wants to come in there and take over a piece of property that's perfectly zoned for what he wants to do, but the neighbors are opposed to it because it doesn't fit the character of the neighborhood.

908
01:18:51,579 --> 01:18:57,303
The state representative from that area, Michael Flaherty, has proposed a piece of legislation, and I believe he's doing it tomorrow morning.

909
01:18:57,703 --> 01:19:02,927
He's proposing a piece of legislation that the character of the neighborhood has to be kept in line for that for which is there.

910
01:19:03,287 --> 01:19:10,993
It cannot be made to look anything different or obnoxious or something that's not satisfying to the public or to the people in that neighborhood.

911
01:19:12,093 --> 01:19:18,815
You know, we're not going to be here in a few years, because however God decides to take us, and when he decides to take us, so be it.

912
01:19:19,436 --> 01:19:26,298
But you guys and girl, you have an opportunity here to make the legacy of this community continue to go forward in a positive way.

913
01:19:26,978 --> 01:19:36,422
If the city administration doesn't want to have the same eye on the prize, then you people should have it, and the zoning should be changed, and the 24 months should be changed, because you'll tell you know,

914
01:19:37,262 --> 01:19:47,888
If a developer comes in here and finds out that he might have to wait 24 months to get that piece of property zoned or done for whatever he needs to do, he might think one of two things.

915
01:19:47,928 --> 01:19:51,470
Number one, I'm going to work with the people, or I'm getting out of here because I don't want to deal with it.

916
01:19:52,090 --> 01:19:52,690
And you know something?

917
01:19:52,730 --> 01:19:56,392
That's probably the best thing, because he's not the real person that should be here for the city.

918
01:19:56,673 --> 01:20:00,515
And isn't it interesting that all the people that are coming into the city are out-of-towners?

919
01:20:01,536 --> 01:20:14,791
You've got to thank the people who took up the charge on Locust Street to bring it to court, to challenge the developer, for which finally found itself before your body and you folks, likewise, to challenge the developer.

920
01:20:15,765 --> 01:20:20,986
The neighborhood that took on the Salem Street, the Break Pearl project.

921
01:20:21,546 --> 01:20:24,987
The neighborhood people had to bring it together, not the city administration.

922
01:20:25,507 --> 01:20:30,428
I don't know how many more black eyes that this city administration needs to get to find out what its history is all about.

923
01:20:31,248 --> 01:20:41,530
But you certainly are making history by destroying pieces of property that have not only historical value, they have a family and a personal and a community value.

924
01:20:42,350 --> 01:20:44,171
Do the right thing tonight, ladies and gentlemen.

925
01:20:44,611 --> 01:20:49,954
Vote for the 24 months, because within that 24 months, you can bargain or they can bargain with you.

926
01:20:50,454 --> 01:21:01,139
But at least the people of this community will know that as an elected official, at least you folks, as a city councilor, are doing the right thing in behalf of the taxpayers of this community.

927
01:21:01,339 --> 01:21:01,719
Thank you.

928
01:21:01,739 --> 01:21:10,263
Name and address of the record, please.

929
01:21:10,592 --> 01:21:11,773
Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez.

930
01:21:11,973 --> 01:21:13,414
I live at 281 Park Street.

931
01:21:14,936 --> 01:21:18,899
And the first thing that everyone says when we talk about Medford is the Medford market is hot.

932
01:21:19,300 --> 01:21:22,682
There was an article this Sunday in the Globe about, hey, Medford, move there.

933
01:21:22,743 --> 01:21:24,744
That place is great.

934
01:21:24,764 --> 01:21:28,407
And Boston Magazine had an article recently about North Medford being great.

935
01:21:28,768 --> 01:21:33,031
You know what's great about the city being great already is that we're not desperate.

936
01:21:34,079 --> 01:21:40,623
We don't have to sell to the guy who sends you that letter in the mail that says, hey, I'll buy you a house sight unseen for $300,000.

937
01:21:40,964 --> 01:21:41,624
Because you know what?

938
01:21:41,664 --> 01:21:44,866
There are families with children that want to move to Medford.

939
01:21:46,087 --> 01:21:47,548
Because we have a deep history.

940
01:21:47,608 --> 01:21:49,349
We have a fabulous community.

941
01:21:49,830 --> 01:21:52,812
We have a spirit of volunteerism that is unmatched in other towns.

942
01:21:53,452 --> 01:21:53,953
And you know what?

943
01:21:55,131 --> 01:21:58,652
Paul Revere rode through here yesterday, and it was a very different Medford.

944
01:21:58,712 --> 01:22:01,272
We need to hold on to those pieces of history.

945
01:22:01,932 --> 01:22:10,534
Back in the day that I was at Medford High, Dr. Valeriani, AP US History, sent us all out to research our homes, to trace the history.

946
01:22:10,574 --> 01:22:14,315
And we went into the tombs of the Cambridge District Court and traced the history.

947
01:22:14,875 --> 01:22:18,476
And the home that my childhood home was a beautiful double lot.

948
01:22:18,976 --> 01:22:22,057
I won't give the address, because I don't want any developers going in and destroying it.

949
01:22:25,285 --> 01:22:33,330
When my grandparents moved to Florida, we left the book that I had made in high school that had traced the history all the way back to the shipbuilding days.

950
01:22:33,710 --> 01:22:37,512
Because Medford is steeped with history, and it's important to all of us.

951
01:22:37,872 --> 01:22:42,375
My parents bought their home, and there were pictures of ships that had been built in the city.

952
01:22:42,795 --> 01:22:43,876
And these things are important.

953
01:22:43,956 --> 01:22:45,457
These things need to be preserved.

954
01:22:46,037 --> 01:22:50,980
I bought my own home here, and I got my own little Medford acre, which is a big yard.

955
01:22:51,340 --> 01:22:54,782
And if you add up the square footage, I could probably build four units.

956
01:22:54,882 --> 01:22:57,063
But that's not what I want.

957
01:22:57,283 --> 01:22:59,644
I want to keep Medford the way that it is.

958
01:23:00,724 --> 01:23:07,908
And we do need to grow and expand, but we don't need to go down the streets and look in people's yards and say, I could put three in there.

959
01:23:08,028 --> 01:23:08,328
I could.

960
01:23:09,388 --> 01:23:12,509
That's not the kind of building that we're looking for.

961
01:23:13,329 --> 01:23:24,332
So I think that you should definitely pass this ordinance to do the 18 to 24 demo display delay because the fastest way to get a legal opinion back from this administration is to pass something.

962
01:23:24,372 --> 01:23:25,252
And that's a whoa.

963
01:23:26,072 --> 01:23:28,573
And then you'll have your answer inside of a week, definitely.

964
01:23:28,993 --> 01:23:33,894
And with all due respect, if I put in and look, I'm looking for information and I don't get follow up,

965
01:23:34,654 --> 01:23:43,960
From the person I sent out to, I'll keep bothering them every two weeks, every month, because August 2016, not having an answer is totally unacceptable.

966
01:23:44,240 --> 01:23:49,844
And I understand that people in this administration are busy, but if this is important to us, zoning is important to us.

967
01:23:50,664 --> 01:23:52,265
Point of information, Councilor Knight.

968
01:23:52,445 --> 01:23:56,288
August 2016 was when the zoning subcommittee issued its report.

969
01:23:56,388 --> 01:23:57,608
September 2016 was when the, um,

970
01:24:00,151 --> 01:24:02,534
district committee, the commission presented their changes.

971
01:24:02,635 --> 01:24:06,780
So there was a month and a month break between when the council was moving forward.

972
01:24:07,341 --> 01:24:13,570
And when did this, when the commission came before the council and then we asked those questions, but their questions got asked after August, 2016.

973
01:24:15,032 --> 01:24:15,332
Thank you.

974
01:24:15,352 --> 01:24:15,813
Counselor Knight.

975
01:24:16,496 --> 01:24:19,759
Well, September, that's a big difference, that 30 days.

976
01:24:19,779 --> 01:24:20,640
I mean, keep waiting.

977
01:24:21,140 --> 01:24:22,842
What are we on, seven months now?

978
01:24:23,762 --> 01:24:25,024
I feel like this is important.

979
01:24:25,304 --> 01:24:32,250
Every time I go down to the building office and I look through those books, I see demo, demo permit, demo permit, demo permit.

980
01:24:33,111 --> 01:24:35,112
This needs to be done now.

981
01:24:35,173 --> 01:24:35,913
We don't have time.

982
01:24:35,973 --> 01:24:41,598
If you wait six more months to put this in committee, I'm not sure how long that moratorium has been in the committee.

983
01:24:41,658 --> 01:24:42,979
I waited, was at a meeting.

984
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:46,742
for your subcommittee and you're waiting for an opinion on that as well.

985
01:24:46,782 --> 01:24:48,984
These things are happening and they're happening now.

986
01:24:49,705 --> 01:24:52,006
And once these houses are knocked down, they're gone.

987
01:24:52,046 --> 01:24:52,767
You can't rebuild.

988
01:24:53,107 --> 01:24:55,429
You can't, oh, well, let's rebuild that 1890 house.

989
01:24:55,469 --> 01:24:56,590
We never should have knocked it down.

990
01:24:56,910 --> 01:24:57,731
It's going to be too late.

991
01:24:58,231 --> 01:25:04,676
So we need to move faster because we don't need any more prefab condos that are going up that cost more than a single family house.

992
01:25:05,016 --> 01:25:08,019
And single family houses, people are desperate to get those in this city.

993
01:25:08,379 --> 01:25:10,600
So I don't know why we want to knock them down.

994
01:25:11,521 --> 01:25:11,861
Thank you.

995
01:25:18,902 --> 01:25:20,063
Name and address of the record, please.

996
01:25:20,363 --> 01:25:22,485
Sharon Guzik, 10 Manning Street.

997
01:25:24,186 --> 01:25:30,452
Unfortunately, I'm just going to repeat a lot of what everybody else said, but I'll try to make that fast.

998
01:25:30,552 --> 01:25:32,293
And I'm going to try to add some color.

999
01:25:33,694 --> 01:25:47,405
I happen to live in the neighborhood that Bob Penta mentioned, which has had developers, specific developer that has come in and discovered

1000
01:25:48,447 --> 01:25:59,673
The neighborhoods ripe for the picking and the points that were being made about losing open space because you can build more than one house on that lot.

1001
01:26:03,124 --> 01:26:09,608
and losing historic trees, which I'm sure you're all familiar with that.

1002
01:26:09,668 --> 01:26:18,613
Those pieces don't actually speak to the resolution that Brianna put forward, but they are important to us.

1003
01:26:19,073 --> 01:26:22,195
And as you heard with 21 Turo Ave, they have

1004
01:26:25,714 --> 01:26:35,557
You know, by making it a historic district, we have, as a city, have some control over what happens to that whole piece of property, the lot.

1005
01:26:36,857 --> 01:26:54,563
We can't do that for every house, obviously, but we can tighten the demolition regulations, ordinances, and give the Medford Historical Commission the tools it needs, tools with teeth,

1006
01:26:55,669 --> 01:27:09,679
And I would strongly suggest that you go for the 24-month delay because you have to give people pause or they are going to come in and just wait out the six months.

1007
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:13,762
Even if you make it 12 months, they'll wait out the 12 months.

1008
01:27:13,822 --> 01:27:23,629
It has to be long enough that somebody that's coming in and looking to, as I think it was Gene said,

1009
01:27:24,110 --> 01:27:25,931
that she calls it flipping.

1010
01:27:26,271 --> 01:27:32,014
They're looking to get a property, demolish what's on it, subdivide it, and build whatever they can.

1011
01:27:34,375 --> 01:27:38,998
In my neighborhood, as I said, the character has been changed.

1012
01:27:39,622 --> 01:27:41,923
by one developer single-handedly.

1013
01:27:42,363 --> 01:27:47,966
We've gotten a prefab duplex next to grandfather's house on South Street.

1014
01:27:49,486 --> 01:27:57,670
A large tree that had to be 150 years old was cut down to make way for another

1015
01:27:58,711 --> 01:28:11,361
pre-fab two family, a house on Summer Street and another large beech tree were demolished and cut down to make way for yet another pre-fab duplex.

1016
01:28:12,201 --> 01:28:20,768
And now there's another house being threatened with demolition, a gorgeous, well, it could use a little,

1017
01:28:22,269 --> 01:28:24,850
TLC on the outside, but you can see it has great bones.

1018
01:28:24,910 --> 01:28:27,671
It's a gorgeous, large, Queen Anne-style house.

1019
01:28:28,432 --> 01:28:39,797
Probably, I'm just guessing, I don't know, but from the 1890s era, it has a large lot, and it's very tempting.

1020
01:28:42,578 --> 01:28:47,420
We could lose this house in short order.

1021
01:28:49,301 --> 01:28:49,801
As you heard,

1022
01:28:50,936 --> 01:28:58,579
The developer's already applied for a demo permit, even though he doesn't technically own the property.

1023
01:28:58,759 --> 01:29:01,461
So he's already got the process started.

1024
01:29:02,681 --> 01:29:14,186
I don't know if there's any way we can impose a moratorium on these things happening at this point while you guys sort out whether you're going to vote for 18 or 24 months for a demo delay.

1025
01:29:19,662 --> 01:29:20,843
It just breaks my heart.

1026
01:29:21,043 --> 01:29:29,528
I'm just seeing the character of my neighborhood with all its, I call them historic houses because they're older than a hundred years old.

1027
01:29:31,149 --> 01:29:34,692
It being, you know, okay.

1028
01:29:35,532 --> 01:29:36,753
I get too emotional about this.

1029
01:29:36,873 --> 01:29:48,881
And as somebody else pointed out, it's fallen to the citizens, the neighbors on those streets to organize and try to fight for keeping those houses, keeping that green space open.

1030
01:29:50,044 --> 01:29:57,851
And in most cases, it's unsuccessful.

1031
01:29:57,911 --> 01:30:13,224
The one good spot was 21 Turo, where Tufts wanted to do the right thing by the neighborhood and found a couple that wanted to live in a historic house and bring it back, restore it to its former glory.

1032
01:30:13,584 --> 01:30:14,946
And they've done a very nice job.

1033
01:30:17,205 --> 01:30:23,311
So I just wanted to emphasize that time is of utmost importance.

1034
01:30:23,432 --> 01:30:26,975
We have to get this done if we're going to save the character of our neighborhoods.

1035
01:30:28,036 --> 01:30:35,264
Right now, we're allowing developers to come in and decide what we want our neighborhoods to be.

1036
01:30:37,901 --> 01:30:40,382
we have no, as citizens, we have no recourse.

1037
01:30:40,582 --> 01:30:47,063
We need to give the tools to the historical commission to save our historic houses.

1038
01:30:47,903 --> 01:30:52,344
And you know, and Doug mentioned the other pieces that need to also be in place.

1039
01:30:52,765 --> 01:31:00,286
Um, I know that's not before you now, but you should keep it in your head and you know, work on those things as well.

1040
01:31:02,287 --> 01:31:02,367
Um,

1041
01:31:05,669 --> 01:31:09,850
Yeah, I made so many notes, I don't know what I was saying.

1042
01:31:12,010 --> 01:31:17,231
Anyway, I'll just stop there and thank you so much for listening to me ramble.

1043
01:31:23,412 --> 01:31:23,692
Thank you.

1044
01:31:23,852 --> 01:31:25,073
Name and address for the record, please.

1045
01:31:25,253 --> 01:31:27,413
John Anderson, 102 Brooks Street.

1046
01:31:28,013 --> 01:31:31,334
I'm also president of the Medford Historical Society and Museum.

1047
01:31:32,887 --> 01:31:46,471
And you can come down to our building at 10 Governors Avenue on a Sunday afternoon and see dozens upon dozens of pictures of lost Medford, buildings that are no more, many of them very beautiful.

1048
01:31:47,791 --> 01:32:00,335
And I can assure you that I speak for the hundreds of people on our mailing list in saying that we strongly support increasing the ability of our commission

1049
01:32:00,851 --> 01:32:03,511
to provide the historic preservation that we all need.

1050
01:32:03,992 --> 01:32:04,372
Thank you.

1051
01:32:11,353 --> 01:32:12,513
Name and address of the record, please.

1052
01:32:12,833 --> 01:32:14,773
David McKillop, 94 Rockland Road.

1053
01:32:16,114 --> 01:32:16,614
Good evening.

1054
01:32:16,954 --> 01:32:24,555
I guess I'm probably not going to be the most popular person right now, but I just want to be pragmatic and speak about the other side of the picture a little bit.

1055
01:32:25,795 --> 01:32:28,956
I listened to what we have to say, what everybody has to say, and I'm 100% in favor of

1056
01:32:31,697 --> 01:32:40,165
changing zoning and having historical areas of the city because I think that's incredibly popular for the preservation of the city.

1057
01:32:40,565 --> 01:32:44,308
It gives a snapshot to the future of what we were in the past.

1058
01:32:44,788 --> 01:32:46,950
However, I just want to throw something out there.

1059
01:32:46,970 --> 01:32:49,452
25 years ago, I bought my house.

1060
01:32:50,193 --> 01:32:51,874
My house was not a historical house.

1061
01:32:52,615 --> 01:32:56,518
Today, if we pass the 75 years, it is now historical.

1062
01:32:57,389 --> 01:33:12,912
Tomorrow, if I choose to tear my house down and build a beautiful new little house that my wife and I can retire in, does that mean that that may not happen because the city council has decided that my home is now a historic home.

1063
01:33:13,772 --> 01:33:19,154
So as an owner of a piece of property with a home that is a decent little home.

1064
01:33:19,434 --> 01:33:20,194
Point of information.

1065
01:33:20,274 --> 01:33:20,834
Councilor Knight.

1066
01:33:21,494 --> 01:33:25,255
Mr. McKillop, the council doesn't make the determination as to whether or not the home is historic.

1067
01:33:25,295 --> 01:33:26,035
The commission does that.

1068
01:33:26,488 --> 01:33:27,848
So all we're doing is giving them the land.

1069
01:33:27,888 --> 01:33:28,088
Correct.

1070
01:33:28,248 --> 01:33:36,590
But if we put it to the point at the hands of the commission, how many homes in the city after 75, 90 years, how many homes become historical homes?

1071
01:33:36,630 --> 01:33:38,411
A very good question.

1072
01:33:38,431 --> 01:33:39,471
That's the point I'm trying to make.

1073
01:33:39,531 --> 01:33:42,592
At one point, the entire city becomes locked.

1074
01:33:43,272 --> 01:33:44,472
And that's what we have to consider.

1075
01:33:44,932 --> 01:33:56,015
So again, painting a clear kind of balanced picture, I think that going in the direction of trying to preserve historical homes 100 years past is an incredibly important thing.

1076
01:33:56,533 --> 01:33:57,073
Excuse me, sir.

1077
01:33:57,453 --> 01:33:58,593
Could we have quiet in the back there?

1078
01:33:58,633 --> 01:34:00,294
Respect the gentleman at the podium.

1079
01:34:00,594 --> 01:34:00,954
Thank you.

1080
01:34:02,254 --> 01:34:03,355
I apologize.

1081
01:34:03,475 --> 01:34:04,075
That's quite all right.

1082
01:34:04,115 --> 01:34:05,935
I mean, opinions are very welcome.

1083
01:34:06,615 --> 01:34:08,196
But we have to consider every aspect.

1084
01:34:08,256 --> 01:34:14,337
And I think that going through this process and finding the right way to make this work for everyone is the best way to go.

1085
01:34:14,397 --> 01:34:16,937
Because again, let's take a look at another example.

1086
01:34:17,358 --> 01:34:18,918
A family has a home.

1087
01:34:19,378 --> 01:34:21,259
passed down generation after generation.

1088
01:34:21,299 --> 01:34:22,839
The family has increased in size.

1089
01:34:22,879 --> 01:34:24,459
The family is no longer in Medford.

1090
01:34:24,900 --> 01:34:28,380
And the last remaining people in that home have passed away.

1091
01:34:28,761 --> 01:34:30,341
Now the family wants to sell that home.

1092
01:34:30,361 --> 01:34:34,502
A developer happens to come in and wants to purchase that home.

1093
01:34:34,982 --> 01:34:40,264
Are you saying to that family they cannot maximize their potential because it is a historical home?

1094
01:34:41,064 --> 01:34:44,785
What is it we're trying to tell the taxpayers?

1095
01:34:44,825 --> 01:34:48,266
So there's two sides to the coin that have to be considered.

1096
01:34:48,766 --> 01:34:51,887
And not that I'm against everything that's been spoken about tonight.

1097
01:34:51,907 --> 01:34:58,409
I'm 100% for it because I think there's some incredibly beautiful homes in this town that have to be preserved.

1098
01:34:58,730 --> 01:35:01,310
But there are two sides to the coin that have to be looked at.

1099
01:35:01,631 --> 01:35:06,352
And that's the obligation of everyone to look at that and protect everyone.

1100
01:35:06,392 --> 01:35:11,914
So it's going to be a challenge to find the best way to come across with this and to find the best rules to make that happen.

1101
01:35:12,955 --> 01:35:13,295
Thank you.

1102
01:35:13,575 --> 01:35:13,835
Thank you.

1103
01:35:18,919 --> 01:35:20,040
Name and address of the record, please.

1104
01:35:20,360 --> 01:35:20,620
Thank you.

1105
01:35:20,640 --> 01:35:23,162
It's Ken Krause, 50 Mystic Street.

1106
01:35:23,683 --> 01:35:31,309
Um, I wanted to speak in favor of the resolution to extend the demolition delay, uh, period for up to 24 months.

1107
01:35:32,289 --> 01:35:47,161
Um, I've observed the Medford historic, uh, commission, uh, do its work for a number of years and, uh, very impressed with, uh, the, their work, the current members, um, led by Ryan Haywood,

1108
01:35:47,657 --> 01:35:51,938
Hayward and Doug Carr, and even back when Nino Susi was involved.

1109
01:35:52,679 --> 01:36:15,386
They're extremely knowledgeable on these matters, very diligent, careful, and they're considerate and respectful, not only of the historic element and aspect, but of the neighborhood and the developer's perspective.

1110
01:36:17,384 --> 01:36:24,889
They work very hard to try to come to a solution that benefits everyone, and it takes time.

1111
01:36:26,100 --> 01:36:34,425
An 18- to 24-month period is not a punitive measure, or a change should not be seen as punitive.

1112
01:36:34,505 --> 01:36:46,732
What it really does is allow the commission time to thoroughly deliberate the matter and look at all alternatives.

1113
01:36:47,613 --> 01:36:54,937
It really just provides them adequate time to do their job, to do it to the best of their ability, and to do it

1114
01:36:55,441 --> 01:36:57,184
in the best interest of the community.

1115
01:36:57,264 --> 01:37:05,957
So I would urge the council to support extending the demolition day delay time up to 24 months.

1116
01:37:06,198 --> 01:37:06,458
Thank you.

1117
01:37:12,116 --> 01:37:13,677
Name and address of the record, please.

1118
01:37:13,697 --> 01:37:14,697
Jean Nuzzo, 35 Parris Street.

1119
01:37:14,877 --> 01:37:16,038
I know I've spoken already.

1120
01:37:16,098 --> 01:37:16,818
I'll be brief.

1121
01:37:17,019 --> 01:37:19,560
I would just like to raise two points of information.

1122
01:37:20,280 --> 01:37:27,724
The first is simply by passing this, that doesn't give a designation to every home as a historical property.

1123
01:37:28,184 --> 01:37:36,088
It just affords the committee the opportunity to review and decide whether a house is of historical significance.

1124
01:37:36,849 --> 01:37:41,151
The second point I'd like to raise with regard to families who've aged here

1125
01:37:41,859 --> 01:37:46,132
and have dwindled off to the last survivors or.

1126
01:37:47,042 --> 01:37:48,602
beneficiaries to benefit.

1127
01:37:49,403 --> 01:37:52,083
Nobody lives in Medford and says, I live on a double lot.

1128
01:37:52,383 --> 01:37:55,564
Ooh, when I die, my beneficiaries are going to make a lot of money.

1129
01:37:56,084 --> 01:38:04,246
What's happening here is the developers coming in, seeing the opportunity, they're giving them market value, and they're making the profit all for themselves.

1130
01:38:04,406 --> 01:38:09,167
So the argument, I'm sorry to say, has some holes in it.

1131
01:38:09,327 --> 01:38:13,589
You know, the people who are benefiting are not really the people who are selling.

1132
01:38:13,669 --> 01:38:15,309
It's the developers who are coming in.

1133
01:38:15,930 --> 01:38:28,366
and taking advantage of those properties because they're able to identify them and they understand the non-conforming and variance rules and how to work with the ZBA and what to do with the Office of Community Development.

1134
01:38:28,747 --> 01:38:30,469
It's not residents that are making that money.

1135
01:38:30,709 --> 01:38:31,050
Thank you.

1136
01:38:31,070 --> 01:38:33,193
Thank you.

1137
01:38:35,905 --> 01:38:37,226
name and address of the record again, please.

1138
01:38:37,326 --> 01:38:37,486
Yup.

1139
01:38:37,646 --> 01:38:48,470
Ryan Hayward, 40 Sharon and have, uh, just to echo those previous comments on the buildings and the determination, the historical commission takes every application on a case by case basis.

1140
01:38:48,590 --> 01:38:58,955
So, you know, an applicant would really need to, you know, anybody would need to apply in order for a building to be determined, um, eligible for this demo delay and then,

1141
01:38:59,562 --> 01:39:03,486
It's a two-step process to get to the actual invocation of the demo delay.

1142
01:39:03,626 --> 01:39:07,449
So we would review the building for historic significance.

1143
01:39:07,490 --> 01:39:16,738
We usually hire a consultant or we already have had forms, MHC, Massachusetts Historical Commission inventory forms prepared for each building in the city of Medford.

1144
01:39:16,778 --> 01:39:18,580
Currently right now we're going through and preparing

1145
01:39:19,062 --> 01:39:23,443
hundreds of forms for various neighborhoods across Medford.

1146
01:39:23,523 --> 01:39:30,425
Right now we're working in East Medford where, just FYI, there are 900 pre-1900 buildings in that neighborhood alone.

1147
01:39:30,665 --> 01:39:34,726
It's the highest concentration of historic buildings anywhere in the city remaining.

1148
01:39:36,346 --> 01:39:40,007
Once we get past the significant process, if we deem it significant per the bylaw,

1149
01:39:40,353 --> 01:39:45,217
We have to determine whether it's preferably preserved in the interest of the city of Medford at large to save.

1150
01:39:45,737 --> 01:39:51,201
Uh, in a lot of cases, uh, we have found that that is true, but in other cases we have found that that's not true.

1151
01:39:51,221 --> 01:39:54,603
It's a higher threshold to, uh, to, you know, to achieve.

1152
01:39:55,064 --> 01:39:59,086
If we determine it's preferably preserved and significant, it invokes the demo delay.

1153
01:39:59,107 --> 01:40:03,550
It would be the exact same, but it's a long process in order to get to that point.

1154
01:40:03,870 --> 01:40:06,492
So every building is given fair review under the law.

1155
01:40:07,613 --> 01:40:07,953
Thank you.

1156
01:40:09,054 --> 01:40:09,334
Thank you.

1157
01:40:12,438 --> 01:40:12,978
Councillor Knight.

1158
01:40:13,839 --> 01:40:32,492
Mr. President, after listening to the residents in the audience come up and speak and discussing at sidebar with some of my colleagues, I'd like to propose an 18-month demolition delay for all homes within the last 75 years by amending 48-78B, by striking 1900 and replacing that with the language within the past 75 years, by amending 48-78H, by striking

1159
01:40:40,455 --> 01:40:42,816
the figure six months and replacing that with 18 months.

1160
01:40:43,416 --> 01:40:49,897
And I'd like to amend 48-78I2 by striking the figure six months and replacing that with the figure 18 months, Mr. President.

1161
01:40:51,338 --> 01:40:58,040
The proposal that came out of the subcommittee gave the commission an opportunity to petition the council for an additional six months.

1162
01:40:59,360 --> 01:41:03,421
I think that this is a paper based upon the sidebar conversations that I've had with my colleagues this evening.

1163
01:41:03,481 --> 01:41:07,022
This is something we can support this evening and that we can pass this evening and we can put it through a first reading.

1164
01:41:07,749 --> 01:41:10,710
So with that being said, Mr. President, I'd like to amend the paper to reflect such.

1165
01:41:11,570 --> 01:41:12,631
Are you making that motion?

1166
01:41:12,651 --> 01:41:13,151
Councilor Knight?

1167
01:41:13,331 --> 01:41:13,771
I just did.

1168
01:41:13,791 --> 01:41:17,132
Do we have a second on Councilor Knight's motion?

1169
01:41:17,152 --> 01:41:17,533
Second.

1170
01:41:18,073 --> 01:41:18,833
Move for question.

1171
01:41:19,573 --> 01:41:20,974
Second on Councilor Knight's motion.

1172
01:41:22,915 --> 01:41:23,735
Councilor Mungo-Kern.

1173
01:41:24,375 --> 01:41:25,956
Thank you, President Carviello.

1174
01:41:25,976 --> 01:41:30,837
I want to thank Councilor Knight and the rest of my colleagues for moving forward on this tonight.

1175
01:41:30,857 --> 01:41:34,519
I heard loud and clear that the commission wants the 24 months,

1176
01:41:35,748 --> 01:41:37,349
I understand maybe the votes aren't there.

1177
01:41:37,709 --> 01:41:48,493
So I'm happy with the 18 months, but I, I do want to go on record as I'm supporting the 24 month demo delay as I think that is something that it's going to give teeth to changing the ordinance.

1178
01:41:48,673 --> 01:41:52,074
I think 18 months is great, but I think 24 months would be better.

1179
01:41:52,354 --> 01:41:53,515
I just wanted to go on record.

1180
01:41:54,715 --> 01:41:55,035
Thank you.

1181
01:41:57,196 --> 01:41:58,256
Name and address of the record, please.

1182
01:41:58,577 --> 01:42:01,257
Andrew cast and had a cushion street method, Massachusetts.

1183
01:42:02,418 --> 01:42:05,199
Um, I'm for historical preservation.

1184
01:42:06,834 --> 01:42:13,397
As a matter of fact, if I may tell you a short story, you might find it interesting, although most of the people behind me I'm sure know this story already.

1185
01:42:14,277 --> 01:42:32,325
I lived in 41 Mystic Avenue for 25 years in a three-family, which was originally a single family, that was originally next to Gaffey's, Captain Isaac Hall's house.

1186
01:42:32,985 --> 01:42:34,146
And they moved that house.

1187
01:42:34,646 --> 01:42:35,687
I have no idea when.

1188
01:42:36,633 --> 01:42:41,395
before I was born, where Governor Zav is today.

1189
01:42:41,955 --> 01:42:53,339
They moved it instead of destroying it over a hundred years ago in order to make Governor's Avenue a reasonable facsimile of Commonwealth Avenue in Boston, from what I understand.

1190
01:42:54,500 --> 01:42:57,981
How they got it across the Karate Bridge, I have no idea.

1191
01:42:58,401 --> 01:42:59,702
That probably explains why those

1192
01:43:02,516 --> 01:43:04,777
200-year-old floors were sagging.

1193
01:43:05,097 --> 01:43:09,399
The house was built in the 1750s, before Paul Revere.

1194
01:43:09,899 --> 01:43:12,641
Paul Revere went right by it, before they pulled governors out.

1195
01:43:12,661 --> 01:43:13,441
That's where the house was.

1196
01:43:13,921 --> 01:43:17,043
Captain Isaac Hall had three sons, if I understand correctly.

1197
01:43:17,703 --> 01:43:19,244
And I was the first of three sons.

1198
01:43:20,604 --> 01:43:23,726
I won't get into the fact that they married three sisters from Cambridge.

1199
01:43:24,706 --> 01:43:30,989
However, by the way, historical designation can be complicated, I'm sure.

1200
01:43:31,857 --> 01:43:35,800
I'm sure there's different entities that classify it, whatever strength of power they have.

1201
01:43:35,960 --> 01:43:36,300
I don't know.

1202
01:43:36,781 --> 01:43:45,607
You have the federal, you have state, city, and I presume there's others, including possibly Middlesex County that I'm not aware of.

1203
01:43:49,970 --> 01:43:59,737
But you should also consider the new growth as not anti-American, especially if we can fix up some blighted properties.

1204
01:44:02,449 --> 01:44:15,779
And as far as gentrification, as the lady had spoken earlier, I don't believe we would have much gentrification, even if real estate taxes, the real estate values, the prices, valuations went up drastically.

1205
01:44:17,480 --> 01:44:31,490
But if you don't use that new growth from the new development to offset Prop 2.5 increases, then we will be pushed out, especially seniors on fixed income.

1206
01:44:31,952 --> 01:44:34,034
or zero income for the last 29 years.

1207
01:44:35,615 --> 01:44:38,037
Just wanted to volunteer a story from my childhood.

1208
01:44:38,438 --> 01:44:38,778
Thank you.

1209
01:44:39,078 --> 01:44:39,499
You're welcome.

1210
01:44:39,659 --> 01:44:41,240
And I saw you.

1211
01:44:42,942 --> 01:44:43,842
Counseling go current.

1212
01:44:44,223 --> 01:44:45,524
Thank you, president.

1213
01:44:45,724 --> 01:44:55,112
I'd like to move approval as amended striking 24 and added, um, 18 month demo delay if that's what the council so chooses and move approval.

1214
01:44:55,212 --> 01:44:58,435
Roll call vote is seconded by councilor Della Russo.

1215
01:44:59,324 --> 01:45:11,791
And this will take its first reading this evening where it is an order to change council marks procedurally.

1216
01:45:11,851 --> 01:45:17,714
Should we take the paper that's before the committee of the whole and a reported out of committee of the whole?

1217
01:45:17,734 --> 01:45:21,396
I mean it's, it's a paper of similar subject matter.

1218
01:45:23,925 --> 01:45:30,672
Also nice, the council rules state that paper that met in subcommittee cannot be reported out of subcommittee until the committee of the whole meets and it's presented.

1219
01:45:30,872 --> 01:45:36,838
So that paper would have to be presented to the committee of the whole in order to be reported out of the committee of the whole and reach the floor pursuant to our rules.

1220
01:45:37,498 --> 01:45:40,301
But we have Councilor Lungo's paper that's in front of us that we can amend.

1221
01:45:40,321 --> 01:45:44,625
That was the theory that I was going with when I made the amendment to the piece of paper.

1222
01:45:48,339 --> 01:45:49,901
What information, Councillor Dallaroso?

1223
01:45:50,061 --> 01:46:06,501
My assent to the paper before us was under the impression that it was a amendation of the original paper that was in subcommittee as presented and refined by Councillor Knight and presented to us at the sidebar tonight.

1224
01:46:09,366 --> 01:46:18,732
which then I hope has taken over the substance, uh, in form of the, uh, resolution 17 dash three 71.

1225
01:46:18,852 --> 01:46:18,972
Okay.

1226
01:46:20,953 --> 01:46:22,034
That's max.

1227
01:46:23,495 --> 01:46:23,795
Sure.

1228
01:46:23,955 --> 01:46:25,436
If the council is fine with that.

1229
01:46:25,456 --> 01:46:25,917
Okay.

1230
01:46:29,299 --> 01:46:32,921
Mr. Click, if you'd like to read the, read it back, so everybody understands what they're voting on.

1231
01:46:32,941 --> 01:46:34,382
All right.

1232
01:46:38,193 --> 01:46:39,814
put us Michael, put us Michael.

1233
01:46:42,716 --> 01:46:43,076
Okay.

1234
01:46:43,276 --> 01:46:44,717
Um, okay.

1235
01:46:44,758 --> 01:46:52,804
So the city of Medford revised ordinance, uh, article for section 48 be amended as follows.

1236
01:46:55,886 --> 01:47:02,431
Uh, section seven, section 77 definitions, uh, and the significant building,

1237
01:47:04,989 --> 01:47:13,897
Section, subsection three, we're going to strike before 1900.

1238
01:47:14,077 --> 01:47:22,444
And you're going to replace within, replace with, within previous 75 years.

1239
01:47:22,484 --> 01:47:23,085
Within 75 years?

1240
01:47:27,729 --> 01:47:29,530
That's what I have.

1241
01:47:35,216 --> 01:47:36,237
It should be 75 years or older.

1242
01:47:36,737 --> 01:47:37,277
Right, correct.

1243
01:47:37,377 --> 01:47:37,637
Right?

1244
01:47:37,717 --> 01:47:39,238
Thank you.

1245
01:47:39,258 --> 01:47:39,818
75 years or older.

1246
01:47:39,838 --> 01:47:42,019
If it says within, that means within now to 75 years.

1247
01:47:42,039 --> 01:47:42,580
Correct.

1248
01:47:42,600 --> 01:47:45,581
Yeah, you're right.

1249
01:47:45,621 --> 01:47:47,702
So it would just be 75 years or older, correct?

1250
01:47:47,722 --> 01:47:48,323
75 years or older.

1251
01:47:48,343 --> 01:47:49,663
75 years or older.

1252
01:48:05,677 --> 01:48:06,037
Thank you.

1253
01:48:18,627 --> 01:48:26,333
Section 48 78 H. I'm going to strike.

1254
01:48:27,354 --> 01:48:29,235
Until at least six.

1255
01:48:30,916 --> 01:48:31,757
Replace it with.

1256
01:48:32,719 --> 01:48:34,921
until at least 18, which is 18 months.

1257
01:48:34,941 --> 01:48:42,266
Section 48-78I2, strike at least 6, replaced with at least 18, 18 months.

1258
01:48:42,326 --> 01:48:46,589
We're going to add a new section.

1259
01:49:02,554 --> 01:49:02,734
Okay.

1260
01:49:02,914 --> 01:49:03,194
That's it.

1261
01:49:03,615 --> 01:49:04,015
That's it.

1262
01:49:05,296 --> 01:49:09,319
And does this require a, this requires a three reading, correct?

1263
01:49:09,819 --> 01:49:10,820
We have to take three readings.

1264
01:49:10,860 --> 01:49:10,940
Yeah.

1265
01:49:10,960 --> 01:49:11,540
All right.

1266
01:49:11,660 --> 01:49:12,961
On the motion by council, let go.

1267
01:49:13,001 --> 01:49:16,643
Kern as amended.

1268
01:49:16,764 --> 01:49:18,365
Seconded by councilor Della Russo.

1269
01:49:18,585 --> 01:49:20,046
This is for the first roll call vote.

1270
01:49:20,466 --> 01:49:21,287
Is this for the first reading?

1271
01:49:21,407 --> 01:49:25,049
So for the first reading, Mr. Clark, please call the roll.

1272
01:49:27,331 --> 01:49:28,251
Councilor Della Russo.

1273
01:49:28,531 --> 01:49:28,832
Yes.

1274
01:49:29,792 --> 01:49:30,573
Councilor Falco.

1275
01:49:30,613 --> 01:49:30,773
Yes.

1276
01:49:31,581 --> 01:49:32,101
Councilor Knight?

1277
01:49:32,301 --> 01:49:32,541
Yes.

1278
01:49:33,522 --> 01:49:34,242
Councilor Langel-Kern?

1279
01:49:34,262 --> 01:49:34,382
Yes.

1280
01:49:35,042 --> 01:49:35,782
Vice President Marks?

1281
01:49:35,922 --> 01:49:36,102
Yes.

1282
01:49:36,643 --> 01:49:37,443
Councilor Scott Pelli?

1283
01:49:37,523 --> 01:49:37,763
Yes.

1284
01:49:38,443 --> 01:49:39,223
President Caviello?

1285
01:49:39,343 --> 01:49:39,584
Yes.

1286
01:49:40,524 --> 01:49:43,305
Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

1287
01:49:43,645 --> 01:49:47,666
Motion passes, and it takes its first reading this evening.

1288
01:49:48,086 --> 01:49:53,888
Thank you all my councilors for deliberating and talking and getting this done.

1289
01:49:55,749 --> 01:49:59,570
Motion by Councilor Langel-Kern to revert back to regular business.

1290
01:50:03,911 --> 01:50:05,753
Seconded by Councilor Dela Russo.

1291
01:50:05,853 --> 01:50:08,996
All those in favor.

1292
01:50:09,016 --> 01:50:09,337
Aye.

1293
01:50:09,357 --> 01:50:09,637
Aye.

1294
01:50:09,657 --> 01:50:11,879
17-366 offered by Vice President Marks.

1295
01:50:12,500 --> 01:50:18,486
Be it resolved that the citywide street sweeping program be discussed.

1296
01:50:19,528 --> 01:50:20,288
Councilor Marks.

1297
01:50:21,770 --> 01:50:23,332
Thank you, Mr. President.

1298
01:50:24,072 --> 01:50:25,274
We're in the midst of

1299
01:50:27,152 --> 01:50:29,935
uh, street sweeping, citywide street sweeping.

1300
01:50:30,816 --> 01:50:37,604
And as I've mentioned in the past, Mr. President, it's, uh, maybe if we could have a recess.

1301
01:50:37,664 --> 01:50:42,009
If we could have a two minute recess until the room clears out.

1302
01:57:05,906 --> 01:57:07,427
Ladies and gentlemen, the back, we're ready to go.

1303
01:57:08,388 --> 01:57:08,808
Thank you.

1304
01:57:08,828 --> 01:57:16,413
The motion by Councilor DelaRusso to revert back to regular business.

1305
01:57:17,714 --> 01:57:20,136
Motion by Councilor DelaRusso to suspend the rules.

1306
01:57:20,854 --> 01:57:25,115
The purpose of taking 17374 from the table, Mr. President.

1307
01:57:25,395 --> 01:57:26,975
He was already in the midst of it.

1308
01:57:27,375 --> 01:57:30,776
My sincerest apologies, then I rescind my request.

1309
01:57:30,816 --> 01:57:31,176
Thank you.

1310
01:57:31,776 --> 01:57:34,677
And ask that the chairman reconvene the meeting.

1311
01:57:34,837 --> 01:57:35,357
Thank you.

1312
01:57:36,938 --> 01:57:38,658
The chairman will reconvene the meeting now.

1313
01:57:39,258 --> 01:57:42,059
And Councilor Marks has the floor.

1314
01:57:42,079 --> 01:57:42,679
Thank you, Mr. President.

1315
01:57:44,532 --> 01:57:45,533
Thank you, Mr. President.

1316
01:57:46,534 --> 01:57:53,558
As I mentioned earlier, we are in the midst of a street sweeping initiative that's going on currently right now.

1317
01:57:54,338 --> 01:58:06,026
And as been stated in the past by myself and many members of this council, that this particular program that we have right now is just a shell of a program.

1318
01:58:06,627 --> 01:58:10,269
And it's existed that way for a number of years, Mr. President.

1319
01:58:10,689 --> 01:58:18,813
And the reason why I bring this up is the fact that right now, in my opinion, the city is not giving proper notification to residents.

1320
01:58:19,561 --> 01:58:21,762
regarding when street sweeping will take place.

1321
01:58:22,743 --> 01:58:39,272
I've recommended in the past, and we'll do so again tonight, that the city embark upon creating permanent signage indicating the date and time of sweeping on every road in the city, Mr. President, which provides residents with notification.

1322
01:58:39,813 --> 01:58:49,038
It allows residents to know of a recurring patent of when streets will be swept, and it allows residents to plan ahead

1323
01:58:49,639 --> 01:58:50,400
Mr. President.

1324
01:58:50,961 --> 01:58:57,189
So permanent signage will accomplish the notification and the planning ahead of residents.

1325
01:58:57,777 --> 01:59:20,225
Also, Mr. President, as I've offered in the past, staggering parking on streets, whether it's odd or even parking during street sweeping, allows residents in those areas that are congested to, that don't have access to a driveway or to put their car somewhere, it'll allow them to park on one side of the street, similar to what we do in snow emergencies.

1326
01:59:21,306 --> 01:59:27,428
And then we can sweep on one side and then on the other side, Mr. President, allowing residents

1327
01:59:28,205 --> 01:59:30,412
ample opportunity to park their cars.

1328
01:59:31,513 --> 01:59:32,953
on either the odd or even side.

1329
01:59:33,353 --> 01:59:45,395
I would ask that this recommendation or these recommendations be sent to the Public Works Subcommittee for full recommendations on the creation of a street sweeping program.

1330
01:59:45,856 --> 01:59:55,897
This is not the first time I've asked that we take a long and hard look at how we operate and do business in this community, in particular regarding street sweeping.

1331
01:59:56,297 --> 02:00:00,058
The fact we only sweep our streets twice a year

1332
02:00:01,299 --> 02:00:03,841
You know, street sweeping accomplishes a number of things.

1333
02:00:04,301 --> 02:00:14,789
It keeps our roads clean, but it also keeps the debris and clutter from going into our catch basins, which create flooding if they get filled up, Mr. President.

1334
02:00:15,130 --> 02:00:26,118
So this is a very important initiative that, for some reason, this city has been lax on creating an effective policy of notification and permanent signage.

1335
02:00:26,859 --> 02:00:29,181
And I think it's long overdue, Mr. President,

1336
02:00:29,756 --> 02:00:42,340
If need be, if the city administration feels to act upon these recommendations like they've done in the past, I would recommend that the city council, and in particular the public works committee, create a city ordinance.

1337
02:00:43,200 --> 02:00:50,982
Because it seems to me that the policy of street sweeping, which is created by the administration, is no longer effective in this community.

1338
02:00:51,363 --> 02:00:59,265
When you see cars that are being tagged and towed, you know, and many of which do not receive

1339
02:00:59,685 --> 02:01:01,165
the notification from the reverse 911.

1340
02:01:01,565 --> 02:01:16,848
I think it's a shame, Mr. President, in this day and age, to hit residents up with a $175 bill before they even start their day off, if they're able to start their day off after their car gets towed.

1341
02:01:18,248 --> 02:01:28,970
So I would offer that in the form of a motion, Mr. President, that this be sent to the Public Works Subcommittee to review permanent signage with dates and times and a recurring

1342
02:01:29,497 --> 02:01:42,044
patent on when our streets will be swept and also to stagger the parking by aught even allowing residents in congested areas to park on the streets during street sweeping.

1343
02:01:42,224 --> 02:01:43,045
Thank you Mr. Vice President.

1344
02:01:43,065 --> 02:01:51,510
The Public Works Subcommittee is headed by Councilor Nyeth, Vice President Mox, and Councilor DelaRusso.

1345
02:01:55,132 --> 02:01:55,452
Thank you.

1346
02:01:56,926 --> 02:01:58,228
Councilor Scarpelli.

1347
02:01:58,308 --> 02:01:59,149
Thank you, Mr. President.

1348
02:01:59,189 --> 02:02:00,731
Thank my colleague for bringing this forward.

1349
02:02:01,332 --> 02:02:13,126
Uh, just for clarity, we, uh, council marks, we're looking to look to and put an eight to 10 month program like neighbor communities have a street sweeping program that runs daily.

1350
02:02:14,167 --> 02:02:15,429
We're looking, um, well,

1351
02:02:20,717 --> 02:02:21,558
Thank you, Mr. President.

1352
02:02:21,918 --> 02:02:23,539
Counsel Scott probably brings up a great point.

1353
02:02:24,120 --> 02:02:27,802
I would envision something starting in April, ending the end of December.

1354
02:02:27,822 --> 02:02:40,412
Uh, I know our business districts probably should be swept probably on a daily basis, maybe the neighborhoods, uh, streets once a month based on the permanent signage, uh, giving dates and times and so forth.

1355
02:02:40,772 --> 02:02:48,218
And maybe, uh, you know, staggering odd even, but, uh, definitely at least once a month from April to December in the neighborhoods.

1356
02:02:48,558 --> 02:02:48,999
Okay.

1357
02:02:49,139 --> 02:02:49,519
If I could,

1358
02:02:50,017 --> 02:03:13,807
If I could, if you could allow me to make a amendment to that paper and looking to ask the city administration for feasibility study, whether it's outsourcing or with hopes to provide what I would hope our DPW with the crew and machinery needed to perform that such act on that type of a basis.

1359
02:03:13,847 --> 02:03:18,629
So I'd love to see more in depth numbers and

1360
02:03:19,472 --> 02:03:21,653
It's something that I would love to see in our community.

1361
02:03:21,693 --> 02:03:22,693
So thank you.

1362
02:03:23,533 --> 02:03:23,874
Thank you.

1363
02:03:23,914 --> 02:03:25,574
Councilor Falco.

1364
02:03:25,674 --> 02:03:26,855
Thank you, Mr. President.

1365
02:03:26,875 --> 02:03:28,995
I want to thank Councilor Moxley for bringing this forward.

1366
02:03:29,035 --> 02:03:31,036
I think this is a great resolution.

1367
02:03:31,076 --> 02:03:32,877
I think it's something that needs to be looked at.

1368
02:03:33,577 --> 02:03:42,520
Um, it, uh, I know that I've received many phone calls when I bump into people in the streets, a lot of people will talk about the cleanliness of the, of the roads in the, in the city.

1369
02:03:43,140 --> 02:03:45,341
And, uh, this is something that needs to be addressed.

1370
02:03:46,099 --> 02:03:48,321
But I, you know, Council Member Akshay, you bring up a good point.

1371
02:03:48,401 --> 02:03:51,304
I think that this is something that should probably be in a city ordinance.

1372
02:03:51,844 --> 02:03:58,970
I mean, this does, I think, hold the city's feet to the fire and says, hey, you know what, this needs to be done X amount of times a year.

1373
02:03:59,010 --> 02:04:02,153
I mean, two times a year right now to me is just not acceptable.

1374
02:04:02,674 --> 02:04:04,235
I mean, people pay their taxes here.

1375
02:04:04,575 --> 02:04:07,217
They deserve to have clean streets and a clean city.

1376
02:04:07,658 --> 02:04:13,603
And I think right now, you know, you go, you drive down many of the streets and, you know, there's debris all over the place, you know, with regard to, you know,

1377
02:04:13,933 --> 02:04:42,608
I mean, you know, I mean, you know, I mean, you know, I mean, you know, I mean, you know, I mean, you know, I mean, you know, I mean, you know, I mean, you know, I mean, you know, I mean, you know, I mean, you know, I mean, you know, I mean, you know, I mean, you know, I mean, you know, I mean, you know, I mean, you know, I mean, you know, I mean, you know, I mean, you know, I mean, you know, I mean, you know, I mean, you know, I mean, you know, I mean, you know, I mean, you know, I mean, you know, I mean, you know, I mean, you know, I mean, you know, I mean, you know, I mean, you know, I mean, you know, I mean, you know, I mean, you know, I mean, you know, I mean

1378
02:04:43,126 --> 02:04:44,466
uh, DPW subcommittee.

1379
02:04:44,686 --> 02:04:52,008
I think that's fine, but I think we need to also look at this, uh, um, you know, on the, uh, ordered in subcommittee as well.

1380
02:04:52,308 --> 02:04:52,608
Thank you.

1381
02:04:52,628 --> 02:04:53,369
Councilor Falco.

1382
02:04:53,809 --> 02:04:54,429
Councilor Knight.

1383
02:04:54,909 --> 02:04:56,129
Mr. President, thank you very much.

1384
02:04:56,149 --> 02:05:00,530
This is a topic that's not new to anybody behind this rail, um, especially during this time of year.

1385
02:05:01,130 --> 02:05:07,492
And, um, one of the items that I see in terms of street sweeping in general, that's lacking in the community is, um, our public utilities.

1386
02:05:07,792 --> 02:05:11,453
And when we issue permits to our public utilities to tear up our streets and they do it,

1387
02:05:12,085 --> 02:05:15,226
And then they decide to come back whenever they feel like coming back to repair our streets.

1388
02:05:15,787 --> 02:05:21,229
And then they leave the streets still looking in an awful situation, an awful mess with sand, with gravel, with dirt all over the place.

1389
02:05:22,630 --> 02:05:29,233
I don't believe that public utilities are required as part of the permitting process when they open up our streets to perform a sweep when they're done.

1390
02:05:29,773 --> 02:05:32,294
And I think that that's something that we should also look at, Mr. President.

1391
02:05:32,334 --> 02:05:33,655
I'd like to amend the paper to reflect that.

1392
02:05:34,333 --> 02:05:45,315
I'd also, as the chairman of the DPW subcommittee, would request that any of my colleagues behind this rail send out an email to the members of the subcommittee with any suggestions that they'd like to see, and we can get to the table and discuss these issues.

1393
02:05:46,035 --> 02:05:46,936
Thank you, Councillor Knight.

1394
02:05:48,116 --> 02:05:49,016
Councillor De La Russa.

1395
02:05:49,636 --> 02:05:54,417
Mr. President, I am grateful to have this opportunity to work on this in a concrete way.

1396
02:05:54,957 --> 02:05:59,218
I know the subcommittee will get things done, certainly under the leadership of Councillor Knight.

1397
02:06:00,018 --> 02:06:03,919
I would like to point out, though, that I think it is fairly

1398
02:06:04,491 --> 02:06:19,295
almost nightly, maybe every other night, I should say at four in the morning as I am awakened every time it happens at four in the morning by our dear friends from the Street Sweeper who come by as I live adjacent to a business district.

1399
02:06:20,815 --> 02:06:29,057
I have the beautiful sound of the humming of the engine, the whining of the transmission, and the scuffing of the

1400
02:06:29,738 --> 02:06:31,799
the brushes that get our streets clean.

1401
02:06:33,020 --> 02:06:35,661
Many of the main streets are done on a daily basis.

1402
02:06:35,701 --> 02:06:35,982
Yes.

1403
02:06:37,102 --> 02:06:42,205
So we can continue to work on this and I think the idea of an ordinance is a good idea.

1404
02:06:42,225 --> 02:06:44,146
I think it's a good idea.

1405
02:06:47,028 --> 02:06:48,269
Name and address for the record please.

1406
02:06:48,834 --> 02:06:49,954
Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez.

1407
02:06:50,014 --> 02:06:51,315
I live at 281 Park Street.

1408
02:06:51,455 --> 02:06:53,735
My street is designated as a main artery.

1409
02:06:54,455 --> 02:07:01,477
So I think we have the street cleaning is supposed to commence in April and begin end on October 30th.

1410
02:07:02,797 --> 02:07:09,038
I hope that part of the discussion will include the main arteries because what we really need on those arteries is enforcement.

1411
02:07:09,258 --> 02:07:11,919
I like Councillor Dela Rousseau get the

1412
02:07:12,555 --> 02:07:13,416
One to two a.m.

1413
02:07:13,456 --> 02:07:16,921
Wake up call now twice a week for the street cleaners coming in the middle of the night.

1414
02:07:17,501 --> 02:07:24,310
But I often look out the window and note that even though one night is odd and one night is even, the street cleaner has to go around a car.

1415
02:07:24,370 --> 02:07:31,699
So if there's no enforcement, then those roads aren't actually getting cleaned, and my husband will go out the next day with the shovel and pick up the debris on the road.

1416
02:07:32,419 --> 02:07:37,225
broken glass and such, that hasn't been picked up by the street cleaner because someone is parked in front of our house.

1417
02:07:37,846 --> 02:07:39,648
So that's important as well.

1418
02:07:39,768 --> 02:07:50,400
Also, when you do the clean sweep in the fall, because street cleaning on the main arteries has ended, we don't get street cleaning after October 30th, so all the leaves are in the streets.

1419
02:07:50,740 --> 02:07:52,862
And the neighbors will go out and take care of those as well.

1420
02:07:53,522 --> 02:07:57,125
So if we're not going to have enforcement, then increased street cleaning is not going to work.

1421
02:07:57,185 --> 02:08:01,849
I know that the police are taxed, but that should be something that is included in the conversation.

1422
02:08:01,929 --> 02:08:11,256
Because even though we have the signs on our street every 10 to 20 feet, there's a sign that says move on Wednesday night, move on Thursday night, the cars are not moving and nothing's happening.

1423
02:08:11,316 --> 02:08:12,837
The street cleaners are just going around them.

1424
02:08:13,417 --> 02:08:15,879
So that's not really useful for us.

1425
02:08:16,279 --> 02:08:17,981
I do hope that it will do more street cleaning.

1426
02:08:18,141 --> 02:08:19,542
My father lives on Garfield Avenue.

1427
02:08:19,926 --> 02:08:23,487
and he's frequently cleaning out the catch basins because they don't get the regular cleaning.

1428
02:08:23,927 --> 02:08:30,848
Thank you on the motion by councilor marks as amended by councilor night.

1429
02:08:31,928 --> 02:08:41,610
Seconded by, and as amended by councilor Scott Pelly seconded by councilor Lungo Kern.

1430
02:08:44,710 --> 02:08:49,231
And this, uh, to send this to these public,

1431
02:08:49,915 --> 02:08:51,296
public works subcommittee.

1432
02:08:52,216 --> 02:08:52,876
All those in favor?

1433
02:08:52,896 --> 02:08:52,956
Aye.

1434
02:08:53,997 --> 02:08:54,817
Motion passes.

1435
02:08:55,997 --> 02:08:56,798
Thank you very much.

1436
02:08:57,498 --> 02:08:58,579
Motion to spend the rules.

1437
02:08:59,179 --> 02:09:04,061
So we that, so we can, um, have Roberta Cameron come up.

1438
02:09:04,081 --> 02:09:10,944
Uh, I know she was a little bit late, uh, to be speaking on the community preservation act.

1439
02:09:11,284 --> 02:09:11,884
All those in favor?

1440
02:09:11,904 --> 02:09:11,964
Aye.

1441
02:09:13,225 --> 02:09:13,545
Thank you.

1442
02:09:14,385 --> 02:09:14,485
Yes.

1443
02:09:18,669 --> 02:09:19,330
Thank you very much.

1444
02:09:19,350 --> 02:09:20,511
Name and address of the record, please.

1445
02:09:20,611 --> 02:09:22,512
Roberta Cameron, 12 North Street.

1446
02:09:23,173 --> 02:09:24,054
My apologies.

1447
02:09:24,114 --> 02:09:27,097
I was double booked tonight and I didn't realize how late they would keep me.

1448
02:09:28,998 --> 02:09:43,832
Um, so, um, I, I think you all know me, uh, my familiarity with community preservation and I sincerely look forward to having the opportunity to help the city of Medford build this, um,

1449
02:09:44,738 --> 02:09:55,623
this program with the Community Preservation Act and see, understand what our needs are and how we can use these resources to carry out our community goals.

1450
02:09:57,484 --> 02:09:57,785
Thank you.

1451
02:09:58,085 --> 02:09:58,405
Thank you.

1452
02:09:59,926 --> 02:10:00,986
Councillor Neistat.

1453
02:10:01,006 --> 02:10:02,327
Mr. President, thank you very much.

1454
02:10:02,767 --> 02:10:14,153
I first met Roberta when she asked me for a signature on the Preserve Medford petition and since that time I've had the opportunity to work with her through the passage of the Act and now the passage of the

1455
02:10:14,960 --> 02:10:16,181
community preservation commission.

1456
02:10:16,841 --> 02:10:21,324
She was a member of the ad hoc subcommittee that put together the language for our city ordinance.

1457
02:10:21,764 --> 02:10:23,746
And if we take a look at Ms.

1458
02:10:23,766 --> 02:10:30,050
Cameron's resume and credentials and contrast that with the city ordinance, you'll see that she meets all the criteria that has been outlined.

1459
02:10:30,770 --> 02:10:37,194
She has a great wealth of experience in technical assistance and implementing the Community Preservation Act and other communities.

1460
02:10:37,695 --> 02:10:41,337
And it was really a pleasure working with her and other members of the committee to get this thing passed.

1461
02:10:42,161 --> 02:10:48,145
And this is really the final step that the City Council has this evening, Mr. President, in our involvement with the creation of the ordinance.

1462
02:10:49,345 --> 02:10:51,367
We appoint the last member of the committee.

1463
02:10:51,387 --> 02:11:00,712
Hopefully she gets approved this evening, and then they get to work on putting proposals together to give to us to decide whether or not they're things that we feel as though should be funded.

1464
02:11:01,292 --> 02:11:09,357
So with that being said, it's with great pleasure that I wholeheartedly endorse Roberta's candidacy and move for approval on the paper number one.

1465
02:11:09,693 --> 02:11:15,898
And number two, it's with great excitement that I'm glad to see the commission finally together up and hopefully soon to be running.

1466
02:11:16,598 --> 02:11:19,020
I would like to point out, your colleagues waited as long as they could for you.

1467
02:11:19,761 --> 02:11:21,622
And I'm on the committee, and they had to leave.

1468
02:11:22,203 --> 02:11:26,486
But I will, for one, Mr. President, have no problem supporting Roberta Cameron for an appointment this evening.

1469
02:11:27,026 --> 02:11:27,367
Thank you.

1470
02:11:28,127 --> 02:11:29,008
Counselor De La Rosa.

1471
02:11:29,028 --> 02:11:33,391
Mr. President, I, too, endorse the candidacy of Roberta.

1472
02:11:34,432 --> 02:11:36,774
I laud her for her leadership in this matter.

1473
02:11:37,589 --> 02:11:40,011
and her commitment to our community and other matters.

1474
02:11:40,792 --> 02:11:50,640
And I also particularly point out her patience and willingness to work with people who might not see things the way that she does.

1475
02:11:51,360 --> 02:11:56,264
And she's offered great leadership, and I'd like to second her approval.

1476
02:11:57,565 --> 02:11:57,805
Thank you.

1477
02:11:57,825 --> 02:11:58,246
Councilor Falco.

1478
02:11:58,526 --> 02:11:59,267
Thank you, Mr. President.

1479
02:11:59,287 --> 02:12:02,829
I just wanted to also endorse Roberta Cameron tonight.

1480
02:12:03,870 --> 02:12:05,932
I was on the ad hoc subcommittee with Roberta.

1481
02:12:06,332 --> 02:12:07,113
She was absolutely

1482
02:12:07,489 --> 02:12:09,250
instrumental in developing the ordinance.

1483
02:12:09,710 --> 02:12:10,491
I know you're a hard worker.

1484
02:12:10,511 --> 02:12:11,631
I know you're going to do a great job.

1485
02:12:11,651 --> 02:12:12,512
I just want to say good luck.

1486
02:12:12,612 --> 02:12:13,092
Thank you.

1487
02:12:14,473 --> 02:12:15,193
Councillor Maxx.

1488
02:12:16,254 --> 02:12:17,314
Thank you, Mr. President.

1489
02:12:17,935 --> 02:12:20,176
As Roberta mentioned she's well known in the community.

1490
02:12:21,096 --> 02:12:27,940
Roberta has been an advocate for a lot of different issues in particular our shade trees and our trees throughout the community.

1491
02:12:28,633 --> 02:12:30,894
Roberta has been a real strong advocate.

1492
02:12:31,614 --> 02:12:38,895
And, you know, based on the makeup of this committee, we have a project manager.

1493
02:12:38,976 --> 02:12:41,256
We have someone that works in real estate.

1494
02:12:41,596 --> 02:12:45,457
We have someone that has a particular interest in historic preservation.

1495
02:12:46,097 --> 02:12:51,518
And with Roberta's credentials, this is going to be a very dynamic committee.

1496
02:12:51,739 --> 02:12:55,299
And I look forward to their eventual recommendations, Mr. President.

1497
02:12:55,859 --> 02:12:56,880
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

1498
02:12:57,140 --> 02:12:58,000
Councilmember O'Connor.

1499
02:12:58,783 --> 02:13:00,184
Thank you, President Caviello.

1500
02:13:00,204 --> 02:13:02,546
I just want to echo the sentiments of my colleagues.

1501
02:13:02,626 --> 02:13:07,170
I've known Roberta for a long time, and she's pushed for a lot of good things in this city.

1502
02:13:07,230 --> 02:13:08,531
And I know she's going to do a great job.

1503
02:13:08,631 --> 02:13:10,192
Thank you for your willingness to serve.

1504
02:13:10,993 --> 02:13:12,214
I think it's just important.

1505
02:13:12,694 --> 02:13:17,278
I pushed my button because I think it was important to point out what Council Marks did and your background.

1506
02:13:17,298 --> 02:13:22,542
You have a planning background, which is extremely important and going to be instrumental on this committee.

1507
02:13:23,262 --> 02:13:25,124
I did ask the other committee members

1508
02:13:25,865 --> 02:13:33,090
could just keep us in the loop and obviously maybe forward us minutes of meetings just so we know what's going on and what's coming down the line, that would be appreciated.

1509
02:13:34,491 --> 02:13:34,871
Thank you.

1510
02:13:35,652 --> 02:13:36,352
Councilor Scarpelli.

1511
02:13:36,873 --> 02:13:38,554
Again, I'm sure I apologize.

1512
02:13:38,574 --> 02:13:45,259
I had to step out for a moment, but I know how tenacious Roberta was to have this issue come to fruition.

1513
02:13:45,319 --> 02:13:54,585
And with your background and your expertise, I know how vital you were as we put the program in place.

1514
02:13:56,129 --> 02:14:04,833
I echo my colleague's comments and very excited to see you as part of this program to see where we can, where we're going to go with this great initiative.

1515
02:14:04,853 --> 02:14:05,353
So thank you.

1516
02:14:05,814 --> 02:14:06,174
Thank you.

1517
02:14:08,435 --> 02:14:08,775
Thank you.

1518
02:14:08,915 --> 02:14:13,877
And I too wanted to thank Roberta for, you know, being out front on many issues in this community.

1519
02:14:14,698 --> 02:14:18,519
And thank you for your, all the work you do here.

1520
02:14:19,680 --> 02:14:22,922
On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Dela Russo,

1521
02:14:25,549 --> 02:14:25,969
Oh, I'm sorry.

1522
02:14:27,570 --> 02:14:27,890
I'm sorry.

1523
02:14:27,910 --> 02:14:29,250
I had the gentleman back.

1524
02:14:29,270 --> 02:14:29,870
Would you like to speak?

1525
02:14:29,890 --> 02:14:32,571
Name, address of the record.

1526
02:14:32,731 --> 02:14:33,912
Thank you, Mr. President.

1527
02:14:33,972 --> 02:14:35,832
Robert Capucci, 71 Evans street.

1528
02:14:36,533 --> 02:14:42,735
Uh, if I could through the chair, I understand this as she's part of the community preservation.

1529
02:14:42,755 --> 02:14:43,795
We are, we are a commission.

1530
02:14:43,935 --> 02:14:46,516
We are approving her nomination by the yes.

1531
02:14:46,736 --> 02:14:49,117
Uh, in, in vetting her out.

1532
02:14:49,497 --> 02:14:49,837
That's right.

1533
02:14:50,213 --> 02:14:55,457
I think it would be prudent to ask the question exactly how does this commission work?

1534
02:14:55,537 --> 02:15:09,608
From my understanding in reading the law is that they get to decide how the funds are spent, but people from the citizenry can also solicit the community preservation commission for funds.

1535
02:15:09,668 --> 02:15:10,448
Point of information.

1536
02:15:10,488 --> 02:15:11,949
Councilor Knight, you will help me.

1537
02:15:12,030 --> 02:15:16,493
The city's ordinance is rather specific and detailed in terms of the procedure and the processes.

1538
02:15:17,162 --> 02:15:22,845
that take place on how an applicant can move forward and request whether or not they have a funding opportunity.

1539
02:15:22,865 --> 02:15:26,447
And there are also certain restrictions that are placed around who would be a qualified and eligible applicant.

1540
02:15:26,767 --> 02:15:27,067
Thank you.

1541
02:15:27,167 --> 02:15:27,668
Thank you very much.

1542
02:15:27,688 --> 02:15:30,489
And I'm sure Roberta is very open to anything.

1543
02:15:31,089 --> 02:15:34,471
If you have an idea, give her a call and she'd be happy to listen.

1544
02:15:35,111 --> 02:15:35,652
On the motion.

1545
02:15:38,413 --> 02:15:41,074
On the motion by Councillor Night, seconded by Councillor De La Russa.

1546
02:15:41,134 --> 02:15:41,735
All those in favour?

1547
02:15:41,755 --> 02:15:42,835
Aye.

1548
02:15:42,855 --> 02:15:43,696
Roberta, thank you very much.

1549
02:15:49,707 --> 02:15:50,867
Yes, Councilor Dela Ruzzo.

1550
02:15:50,887 --> 02:16:09,335
Mr. President, while we're on to suspension, I respectfully request that we take out of order paper 17-374, communications from the mayor regarding the expenditure of monies from free cash for the updating of our election equipment.

1551
02:16:09,815 --> 02:16:13,116
On the motion by Councilor Dela Ruzzo to take paper 17-374,

1552
02:16:16,417 --> 02:16:17,017
Out of order.

1553
02:16:17,157 --> 02:16:19,358
Suspension second by counselor knife.

1554
02:16:19,698 --> 02:16:20,319
All in favor.

1555
02:16:20,339 --> 02:16:20,719
Aye.

1556
02:16:21,239 --> 02:16:22,640
Thank you, Mr. President.

1557
02:16:22,800 --> 02:16:43,808
Uh, if I could, uh, speak on your behalf, we met and I appreciate that, uh, to, um, uh, have a presentation from, uh, the city clerk, uh, regarding the condition of, uh, some of our election equipment, uh, in our need to replace it, that the, uh, equipment has become rather old.

1558
02:16:45,133 --> 02:16:46,154
over 20 years old.

1559
02:16:46,975 --> 02:16:55,625
It's difficult to find replacement parts and backup support for the machines, which were once cutting edge.

1560
02:16:57,307 --> 02:17:00,491
And now we're on the verge of the

1561
02:17:01,092 --> 02:17:14,482
clerk with approval of this, uh, and the commitment to free cash will, um, uh, assist the process of sending out an RFP and, uh, the purchase and examination of, uh, some options.

1562
02:17:15,062 --> 02:17:21,687
And so, uh, we had a detailed discussion and the, uh, committee of the whole, uh, and it was reported out favorably.

1563
02:17:22,048 --> 02:17:24,069
So I'd like to move approval, Mr. President.

1564
02:17:25,870 --> 02:17:26,231
Thank you.

1565
02:17:26,271 --> 02:17:30,514
On the motion by Councilor Dela Russo seconded by Councilor Knight.

1566
02:17:31,829 --> 02:17:32,810
All those in favour?

1567
02:17:34,411 --> 02:17:35,171
Councillor Marks.

1568
02:17:37,412 --> 02:17:38,413
Thank you, Mr. President.

1569
02:17:38,893 --> 02:17:41,035
I am not opposed to this particular paper.

1570
02:17:41,955 --> 02:17:53,162
I think it's long overdue to have equipment in the Registrar of Voters Office as well on Election Day that properly reflects the will of the people.

1571
02:17:54,383 --> 02:17:55,944
And I think equipment is needed.

1572
02:17:56,544 --> 02:17:59,806
I do, Mr. President, have to say that

1573
02:18:00,922 --> 02:18:20,129
This council has voted unanimously on at least three different occasions requesting that our brave men and women of the fire department receive the two extractors, which are washing machines on steroids, Mr. President, and two dryers to clean their turnout gear.

1574
02:18:20,790 --> 02:18:27,192
As I mentioned several weeks ago when I made a presentation before this council, that was unanimously supported.

1575
02:18:27,688 --> 02:18:53,124
I requested that the administration look into buying two more washes because currently, right now, many of the brave men and women of our fire department are using turnout gear that is potentially in a fire and contaminates on the turnout gear that's leaching into our firefighters' skins, Mr. President, and could be causing risk of cancer.

1576
02:18:54,938 --> 02:18:56,580
I've asked this on several occasions.

1577
02:18:56,620 --> 02:18:59,284
The administration said that they were looking into grants.

1578
02:18:59,845 --> 02:19:06,234
I did talk to Bill O'Brien, the union president, and he mentioned they are pursuing a grant.

1579
02:19:06,621 --> 02:19:15,426
right now for two washes and two dries that will be located at the firefighter headquarters on Main Street.

1580
02:19:16,686 --> 02:19:19,848
And if the grant comes through, fine, Mr. President.

1581
02:19:20,588 --> 02:19:24,130
There's nothing that precludes this council from allotting $29,700.

1582
02:19:24,250 --> 02:19:35,116
That's what it's going to take to assure our men and women in the fire department have the proper equipment to wash their gear, Mr. President.

1583
02:19:35,416 --> 02:19:38,378
That's all it's going to take, $29,700.

1584
02:19:38,599 --> 02:19:46,205
And if the grant comes through, Mr. President, that grant will pay back the money that was taken out of the free cash.

1585
02:19:46,585 --> 02:20:03,899
So I would respectfully ask, Mr. President, as part of this paper, there'd be a B paper requesting that the mayor appropriate $29,700 to pay for two washing machines, which are two extractors and two dryers, Mr. President.

1586
02:20:04,560 --> 02:20:09,426
for the fire department, which has been unanimously supported by this council.

1587
02:20:10,608 --> 02:20:22,223
So I would ask that as a big paper, as part of this paper, Mr. President may also point out that it was, uh, uh, reported to us that these new

1588
02:20:22,757 --> 02:20:37,702
polling machines, Mr. President, these new election machines, uh, will not be subject to, uh, undue interference from, uh, foreign powers, whether they be Eastern European or Asian or anywhere else.

1589
02:20:38,602 --> 02:20:39,942
Thank you, Councilor DelaRusso.

1590
02:20:42,783 --> 02:20:50,726
On the motion by Councilor DelaRusso, as amended by Councilor Max,

1591
02:20:53,405 --> 02:21:02,347
The $29,700 be appropriated from free cash for the purpose of two washes and two dryers.

1592
02:21:02,887 --> 02:21:04,147
Name and address for the record, please.

1593
02:21:05,027 --> 02:21:08,168
Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Avenue, Medford, Mass.

1594
02:21:08,288 --> 02:21:10,008
I commend Councilor Marks.

1595
02:21:10,169 --> 02:21:10,549
Excellent.

1596
02:21:10,689 --> 02:21:15,570
I love seeing good, important, tangible items brought to the table.

1597
02:21:16,310 --> 02:21:20,791
Tonight in Georgia, there's an election and four of the machines, four of the machines are down.

1598
02:21:20,831 --> 02:21:21,811
Now the good guy's winning.

1599
02:21:22,386 --> 02:21:24,790
The Democrat, that's my political speech there.

1600
02:21:25,110 --> 02:21:27,513
But he's winning by a huge margin.

1601
02:21:27,553 --> 02:21:29,757
But there's four machines, and that really concerns me.

1602
02:21:29,817 --> 02:21:33,262
So new election machines, yes, we need them.

1603
02:21:33,742 --> 02:21:37,528
I think we need an outside agency to come in.

1604
02:21:38,007 --> 02:21:41,809
and look at this, because the citizens don't know what we're doing when we vote.

1605
02:21:42,290 --> 02:21:43,210
We don't know where it goes.

1606
02:21:43,230 --> 02:21:44,231
It can go into the ether.

1607
02:21:44,331 --> 02:21:50,735
So I know there's partisan people here in city government, and we want to make sure that everything's done correctly.

1608
02:21:51,175 --> 02:21:53,877
So there was a lot of questions about the last election.

1609
02:21:54,677 --> 02:21:57,179
The citizens need to know which kind of machines are coming in.

1610
02:21:57,579 --> 02:22:02,042
We need an outside agency looking at them so that every citizen knows that their vote counts.

1611
02:22:02,582 --> 02:22:03,283
Thank you very much.

1612
02:22:03,903 --> 02:22:04,243
Thank you.

1613
02:22:06,345 --> 02:22:06,945
Councillor Nice.

1614
02:22:07,898 --> 02:22:10,179
On that note, Mr. President, I would like to commend the work that Ms.

1615
02:22:10,219 --> 02:22:13,981
Murray, Mr. Lasky, and Mr. Wade do, our elections commissioners.

1616
02:22:14,041 --> 02:22:15,162
I think they're doing a great job.

1617
02:22:15,262 --> 02:22:16,022
It was great to see them.

1618
02:22:16,042 --> 02:22:17,223
They were very good outside boarding.

1619
02:22:17,363 --> 02:22:19,384
It was great to see them before the council this evening.

1620
02:22:19,424 --> 02:22:23,566
It's something that we haven't seen too much of in the past, the full boarding, the full board coming before us this evening.

1621
02:22:23,606 --> 02:22:25,667
So I'd like to thank them for the work that they do.

1622
02:22:25,687 --> 02:22:27,188
Congratulate them and move approval on the paper.

1623
02:22:27,588 --> 02:22:28,328
Outstanding boarding.

1624
02:22:29,489 --> 02:22:35,172
On the motion by Councilor Dela Russo, as amended by Councilor Marks,

1625
02:22:36,852 --> 02:22:39,994
seconded by Councilor Knight.

1626
02:22:41,995 --> 02:22:43,456
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1627
02:22:45,817 --> 02:22:46,798
Councilor DelaRosso?

1628
02:22:47,058 --> 02:22:47,478
Yes.

1629
02:22:48,039 --> 02:22:48,779
Councilor Falco?

1630
02:22:48,959 --> 02:22:49,299
Yes.

1631
02:22:49,880 --> 02:22:50,400
Councilor Night?

1632
02:22:50,500 --> 02:22:50,740
Yes.

1633
02:22:51,461 --> 02:22:52,281
Councilor Otero?

1634
02:22:52,421 --> 02:22:52,621
Yes.

1635
02:22:53,602 --> 02:22:54,382
Vice President Marks?

1636
02:22:54,542 --> 02:22:54,923
Yes.

1637
02:22:55,803 --> 02:22:56,564
Councilor Scarpelli?

1638
02:22:56,724 --> 02:22:56,984
Yes.

1639
02:22:58,647 --> 02:23:00,948
Yes, seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

1640
02:23:01,428 --> 02:23:02,488
Motion passes.

1641
02:23:02,968 --> 02:23:07,109
Motion by Councilor Donnarusso to revert back to regular business.

1642
02:23:08,250 --> 02:23:09,570
Seconded by Councilor Nights.

1643
02:23:10,330 --> 02:23:13,991
All those in favor?

1644
02:23:14,011 --> 02:23:26,494
17-367, offered by Vice President Mox, be it resolved that the new bimonthly fixed charge, also known as connectivity charge, for Memphis water and sewer rates

1645
02:23:28,231 --> 02:23:29,312
be discussed.

1646
02:23:30,072 --> 02:23:31,133
Vice President Marks.

1647
02:23:31,793 --> 02:23:32,814
Thank you, Mr. President.

1648
02:23:33,274 --> 02:23:37,756
I spoke about this issue, I believe it was last week or the week?

1649
02:23:38,136 --> 02:23:38,496
Last week.

1650
02:23:38,516 --> 02:23:38,697
Last week.

1651
02:23:38,717 --> 02:23:39,597
Thank you, Mr. President.

1652
02:23:40,237 --> 02:23:44,900
And this council voted to set up a Committee of the Whole meeting.

1653
02:23:44,920 --> 02:23:45,480
That's correct.

1654
02:23:45,500 --> 02:23:47,661
Which I believe is going to take place May 2nd.

1655
02:23:47,681 --> 02:23:48,201
May 2nd.

1656
02:23:48,521 --> 02:23:49,062
May 2nd.

1657
02:23:49,102 --> 02:23:51,283
And I want to thank you for your quick response on that.

1658
02:23:51,303 --> 02:23:52,103
You're welcome.

1659
02:23:52,123 --> 02:23:55,625
This is a really important issue that's impacting

1660
02:23:56,104 --> 02:24:02,466
every resident in this community that pays a water and sewer bill.

1661
02:24:02,486 --> 02:24:06,066
I received additional information, and that's why I'm bringing it up tonight.

1662
02:24:06,567 --> 02:24:14,068
I received a letter dated November 17, 2015, regarding Meffitt Water and Sewer Commissioners.

1663
02:24:14,969 --> 02:24:24,851
And the letter goes on to state, Mr. President, that the Water and Sewer Commissioners voted to create what they refer to as

1664
02:24:25,416 --> 02:24:29,700
a baseline charge on everyone's water and sewer bill.

1665
02:24:30,481 --> 02:24:36,587
When I read on, Mr. President, they refer to it as, which I referred to it last week, as a connectivity charge.

1666
02:24:37,528 --> 02:24:46,878
And the way I understand it is every resident will receive this additional charge on a bimonthly basis starting in August 1st, 2018.

1667
02:24:50,651 --> 02:25:03,883
And the reason that I got for the implementation of this connectivity charge is that it will pay for infrastructure improvements and other water and sewer necessities.

1668
02:25:04,684 --> 02:25:10,770
We all know right now there's over $8 million in the water and sewer enterprise account in surplus funds.

1669
02:25:11,477 --> 02:25:20,520
And that money, by state law, is earmarked to not only reduce the rate, if need be, but also for infrastructure improvements.

1670
02:25:21,321 --> 02:25:27,823
And it can only be spent on infrastructure improvements or reduction in water and sewer rates.

1671
02:25:28,663 --> 02:25:36,326
And this particular charge, in my opinion, is nothing more than an additional surcharge on the ratepayers of this community.

1672
02:25:36,946 --> 02:25:38,947
And the additional information I did receive

1673
02:25:39,694 --> 02:25:53,585
And I can let my colleagues see it, or I can make a copy for May 2nd, is that they actually went as far as breaking down the additional charge by the size of the water pipe that comes into your house.

1674
02:25:54,671 --> 02:26:02,955
And most people in this community, in the residential areas, have a five-eighths pipe that comes into the house.

1675
02:26:03,536 --> 02:26:12,540
And that additional connectivity charge will be $9.47 bi-monthly, which is six times.

1676
02:26:13,061 --> 02:26:16,062
So it's roughly $60 additional a year.

1677
02:26:16,583 --> 02:26:19,164
It may not sound like a lot, but you know what?

1678
02:26:19,224 --> 02:26:22,946
When you have an $8 million surplus of ratepayer money,

1679
02:26:23,440 --> 02:26:24,304
sitting in an account.

1680
02:26:24,861 --> 02:26:34,925
That's a lot of money to additionally request, Mr. President, and also request it based on the fact that it's for infrastructure improvements.

1681
02:26:35,466 --> 02:26:37,046
And that's the money we're already collecting.

1682
02:26:37,326 --> 02:26:38,727
And we already have a surplus.

1683
02:26:39,187 --> 02:26:42,729
As part of the bill we currently pay right now, it goes to your water.

1684
02:26:43,069 --> 02:26:44,149
It goes to delivery.

1685
02:26:44,450 --> 02:26:45,950
It goes for the maintenance of the pipes.

1686
02:26:46,310 --> 02:26:51,473
It goes for the workers within the city of Meffitt that are in the water and sewer department.

1687
02:26:51,853 --> 02:26:54,134
So that's already built into the rate structure.

1688
02:26:54,514 --> 02:26:59,537
This is an added cost that I am adamantly opposed to, Mr. President.

1689
02:27:00,297 --> 02:27:14,125
I need to say, I find it ironic, Mr. President, that the Water and Sewer Commission would take a vote or be presented with a proposal in November of 2015.

1690
02:27:17,031 --> 02:27:23,356
And then the city administration sit on it, not till last year when we had a mayor race.

1691
02:27:23,376 --> 02:27:24,917
They didn't touch it then.

1692
02:27:26,438 --> 02:27:27,279
Not this year.

1693
02:27:28,540 --> 02:27:32,043
I mean, last year was an off year.

1694
02:27:33,164 --> 02:27:41,690
To not sit on it during the mayor race, which was in 2015, sit on it in 2016, the first term of the new mayor.

1695
02:27:42,211 --> 02:27:43,752
No, didn't want any increases then. 2017.

1696
02:27:46,522 --> 02:27:47,823
New May is up for reelection.

1697
02:27:48,103 --> 02:27:49,204
Let's sit on it again.

1698
02:27:49,224 --> 02:27:52,446
2018 sounds like a great time.

1699
02:27:52,746 --> 02:27:58,009
Let's do it in August of 2018 when everyone's vacationing and not paying attention.

1700
02:27:58,349 --> 02:28:04,853
That sounds like a great time to implement something almost three years after the fact, Mr. President.

1701
02:28:05,513 --> 02:28:11,537
I really would like to hear from the administration to explain why this is being rolled out in August of 2018.

1702
02:28:13,118 --> 02:28:14,439
What's the reasoning behind it?

1703
02:28:15,099 --> 02:28:21,922
Also, Mr. President, you know, I mentioned $60, and people at home may say, ah, $60, that's not too much.

1704
02:28:22,642 --> 02:28:28,945
That's $1.5 million they're going to raise from roughly a $60 surcharge.

1705
02:28:29,565 --> 02:28:33,407
Now, not everyone has a 5-8 pipe coming into their home.

1706
02:28:33,807 --> 02:28:38,429
We have condos associations that may have an inch pipe, a two-inch pipe.

1707
02:28:38,970 --> 02:28:40,470
Their bill will be $75 bimonthly.

1708
02:28:44,687 --> 02:28:50,229
You go up further to some of the larger corporations in our city that may have a six or 10-inch pipe.

1709
02:28:50,789 --> 02:28:56,612
A 10-inch pipe, Mr. President, coming in, that's $1,087 bimonthly.

1710
02:28:57,412 --> 02:29:00,393
That's $6,000 additional charge.

1711
02:29:01,114 --> 02:29:04,175
Now, I don't know what businesses or how many have a 10-inch pipe.

1712
02:29:05,121 --> 02:29:07,983
or a six-inch water pipe, which is $472.

1713
02:29:09,084 --> 02:29:13,547
But all I can tell you, Mr. President, there's nothing worse than a hidden charge.

1714
02:29:13,987 --> 02:29:21,473
You know, we've been paying for the last three or four years a franchise fee to get local access cable.

1715
02:29:22,453 --> 02:29:29,798
Local access cable, Mr. President, we've all been paying, and we haven't received local access cable in almost four years.

1716
02:29:30,919 --> 02:29:33,381
And I stand to be corrected, it may even be longer than that.

1717
02:29:34,807 --> 02:29:39,389
So all these little additional fees that are out there, Mr. President, do add up.

1718
02:29:39,849 --> 02:29:49,732
Do add up to the senior citizens on a fixed income that can't afford an additional penny on their bill, let alone another $60 for a charge, Mr. President.

1719
02:29:49,932 --> 02:29:51,032
They're already charging us.

1720
02:29:51,753 --> 02:29:56,794
You already have $8 million of the taxpayers' money, Mr. President, in an account.

1721
02:29:57,355 --> 02:29:58,355
What more do you want?

1722
02:29:59,155 --> 02:30:00,776
What more do you want from the ratepayers?

1723
02:30:01,696 --> 02:30:02,817
It's easy picking.

1724
02:30:03,197 --> 02:30:03,817
That's what it is.

1725
02:30:03,877 --> 02:30:05,618
It's easy picking, Mr. President.

1726
02:30:06,559 --> 02:30:21,046
So I would ask, Mr. President, that when we meet with the Water and Sewer Commission on May 2nd, that the administration is also represented and also that Ron Baker, which I mentioned, I'm not sure if you added him,

1727
02:30:21,366 --> 02:30:21,907
to the list.

1728
02:30:22,047 --> 02:30:22,867
He's on the list.

1729
02:30:22,907 --> 02:30:23,608
He's on the list.

1730
02:30:23,888 --> 02:30:36,437
So we can have a thorough explanation on, not only from the Water and Sewer Commission, it's from the city administration, who's been sitting on this for several years now, for the opportune time to present it when no one's paying attention.

1731
02:30:36,817 --> 02:30:37,958
That's what this boils down to.

1732
02:30:38,338 --> 02:30:41,680
We can put that question forward so we'll have that information for that meeting.

1733
02:30:41,740 --> 02:30:44,803
I'd like to hear it from the horse's mouth, instead of from the other end.

1734
02:30:45,763 --> 02:30:46,944
I'd like to hear it from the horse's mouth.

1735
02:30:46,964 --> 02:30:48,145
We will invite the administration to the meeting.

1736
02:30:48,765 --> 02:30:50,146
OK, I'd appreciate that, Mr. President.

1737
02:30:50,166 --> 02:30:50,547
Thank you.

1738
02:30:50,647 --> 02:30:50,947
Thank you.

1739
02:30:52,059 --> 02:30:52,840
Councilor Doroso.

1740
02:30:53,380 --> 02:31:10,796
Mr. President, I, too, look forward to hearing more about this from the city administration, members of the Water and Sewer Commission, and the appropriate parties who are able to present to us factual information, which I look forward to.

1741
02:31:11,497 --> 02:31:14,860
And I thank you in advance for your leadership in the matter, Mr. President.

1742
02:31:14,880 --> 02:31:15,981
Thank you, Councilor Doroso.

1743
02:31:16,789 --> 02:31:18,090
Councilor Lococo.

1744
02:31:18,170 --> 02:31:19,691
Thank you, President Caravaggio.

1745
02:31:19,731 --> 02:31:22,153
I just want to thank Councilor Marks for bringing this forward.

1746
02:31:22,233 --> 02:31:24,574
I was unaware.

1747
02:31:24,594 --> 02:31:26,395
I don't know how you got the information.

1748
02:31:26,435 --> 02:31:29,958
If you could provide us with that information, maybe by email before the meeting.

1749
02:31:29,978 --> 02:31:32,499
OK.

1750
02:31:32,980 --> 02:31:33,620
Yeah.

1751
02:31:33,700 --> 02:31:38,283
I'm just glad it's been brought to our attention before they roll it out.

1752
02:31:38,583 --> 02:31:43,046
Come August 2018, I definitely am in agreement with Councilor Marks.

1753
02:31:43,527 --> 02:31:45,588
We already overtaxed the taxpayer.

1754
02:31:46,104 --> 02:31:50,126
the ratepayers, and now, you know, any additional fees or charges.

1755
02:31:50,926 --> 02:31:52,287
It does hurt a lot of people.

1756
02:31:52,387 --> 02:31:54,888
Some people can afford it, but a lot of people can't.

1757
02:31:54,928 --> 02:31:56,388
And those are the people that we hear from.

1758
02:31:56,408 --> 02:31:57,589
So I'm glad.

1759
02:31:57,729 --> 02:32:05,772
Thank you for setting up a meeting, President Carviello, and I look forward to getting some answers and hopefully making some changes to the potential possibility.

1760
02:32:05,792 --> 02:32:07,833
The second council will hold 6 o'clock p.m.

1761
02:32:07,853 --> 02:32:10,074
Name and address of the record, please.

1762
02:32:10,855 --> 02:32:11,895
Thank you, Mr. President.

1763
02:32:12,075 --> 02:32:13,476
Robert Cappucci, 71 Evans Street.

1764
02:32:14,822 --> 02:32:19,464
Through the chair, I want to thank Councillor Marks for bringing this up and bringing this information forward.

1765
02:32:20,024 --> 02:32:42,132
Mr. President, on two separate other debating topics tonight, the vetting of the new Community Preservation Commission, a new shadow government method, and on Councillor Lungo-Kern's resolution about the demolition, a lot of talk was generated on affordable housing and preserving historic landmarks.

1766
02:32:42,754 --> 02:32:48,606
here's a great opportunity to give a little bit more affordable housing to the residents of Medford.

1767
02:32:49,185 --> 02:32:59,752
And as far as historical landmarks go, how about our senior citizens, like my mother, who's 78 years old, who is a historic person, as far as I'm concerned, here in Medford.

1768
02:33:00,072 --> 02:33:11,860
This charge, Mr. President, and I'm a little passionate about this, is outrageous, especially when Councilor Marks refers to the fact that there's $8 million in an overtaxed account.

1769
02:33:12,200 --> 02:33:16,243
Here's a great opportunity to provide a little bit more affordable housing

1770
02:33:16,523 --> 02:33:18,525
to the citizens of Medford, and we shouldn't wait until 2018.

1771
02:33:19,065 --> 02:33:25,210
The power of this body should somehow find a way to kill this now, not wait.

1772
02:33:25,250 --> 02:33:26,791
May 2nd will be the Council's only meeting.

1773
02:33:27,051 --> 02:33:38,900
And on that point, because this is such an important matter, perhaps that Committee of the Whole meeting should be in this chamber, under the TV, so people at home can watch this, Mr. President.

1774
02:33:39,820 --> 02:33:44,724
It's unfortunate that that meeting is not available to the whole public through

1775
02:33:45,154 --> 02:33:47,696
through technology in some fashion.

1776
02:33:49,557 --> 02:33:53,620
To me, I'm sorry, this is really outrageous.

1777
02:33:54,501 --> 02:33:55,821
Something should be done.

1778
02:33:56,402 --> 02:34:07,730
In terms of talking about affordability for the residents of Medford, another speaker spoke earlier tonight about how the rents are going way up.

1779
02:34:08,090 --> 02:34:08,951
Why do you think that is?

1780
02:34:10,168 --> 02:34:19,978
When the property taxes are always going up, our sales taxes, excise taxes, excess in taxes, a cash account with another $10 million into it.

1781
02:34:20,458 --> 02:34:34,772
This stuff trickles downhill, Mr. President, in the lower income, in the middle income, and the poor people are the ones who end up paying all of these excessive costs for living in the city of Medford, especially when there's a surplus.

1782
02:34:35,100 --> 02:34:37,562
Mr. President... May 2nd, voice your concerns that night.

1783
02:34:38,162 --> 02:34:40,023
I'm voicing them here and now too, Mr. President.

1784
02:34:40,043 --> 02:34:40,424
Thank you.

1785
02:34:40,484 --> 02:34:41,284
It's outrageous.

1786
02:34:41,304 --> 02:34:41,504
Thank you.

1787
02:34:41,524 --> 02:34:42,225
Thank you very much.

1788
02:34:43,065 --> 02:34:44,226
Mr. President.

1789
02:34:44,246 --> 02:34:45,147
Vice President Max.

1790
02:34:46,228 --> 02:34:48,309
Just if I can also amend the paper.

1791
02:34:48,749 --> 02:34:59,917
If we can also before the May 2nd meeting get a copy of the minutes which the vote of the Water and Sewer Commission took place that voted on this connectivity charge.

1792
02:35:00,497 --> 02:35:02,299
If we can have a copy of the minutes for that.

1793
02:35:02,499 --> 02:35:04,220
A copy of the minutes be provided also.

1794
02:35:05,425 --> 02:35:09,048
of the meeting where the vote was taken for this connectivity charge.

1795
02:35:09,989 --> 02:35:10,329
Thank you.

1796
02:35:11,330 --> 02:35:12,511
Name and address of the record, please.

1797
02:35:14,012 --> 02:35:15,954
David McKillop, 94 Rockland Road.

1798
02:35:17,035 --> 02:35:18,696
I live up in an area called the Heights.

1799
02:35:19,137 --> 02:35:20,818
I'm sure most people are familiar with it.

1800
02:35:20,918 --> 02:35:25,182
One of the things about the Heights that's very unique is our water pressure.

1801
02:35:25,618 --> 02:35:38,026
I had the rare opportunity of sitting across at one of the mayor's meet and greets, the commissioner of the water and sewer, and asked him, has that area of Medford ever been reviewed?

1802
02:35:38,766 --> 02:35:40,107
Because the water pressure is

1803
02:35:40,700 --> 02:35:50,344
It's sometimes so horrific that if I'm taking a shower and my neighbor waters their lawn, I guess I'm taking a cold shower or a very little one or a very fast one.

1804
02:35:51,464 --> 02:35:54,285
And his response to me was, oh, yeah, it's reviewed all the time.

1805
02:35:54,565 --> 02:35:58,847
And it's a very costly review to process.

1806
02:35:58,927 --> 02:36:02,208
And how long ago, my question was, was that reviewed?

1807
02:36:02,348 --> 02:36:04,649
Oh, many, many years ago, but we look at it all the time.

1808
02:36:05,209 --> 02:36:09,171
So my question is, how can we have an $8 million surplus

1809
02:36:10,376 --> 02:36:17,962
and have areas of the city that have a deficit when it comes to things that need to be looked at, repaired, fixed, replaced, changed.

1810
02:36:18,062 --> 02:36:21,504
I know I'm on a five-eighths piping.

1811
02:36:21,904 --> 02:36:24,867
Part of that is so the pressure can kind of maintain a certain level.

1812
02:36:25,707 --> 02:36:35,935
But really, seriously, it's just ironic that we would ask for an additional $1.45 million a year to add what, to the surplus?

1813
02:36:36,195 --> 02:36:36,875
I'm confused.

1814
02:36:37,436 --> 02:36:39,117
And the other thing I really kind of

1815
02:36:40,140 --> 02:36:44,163
me being mathematical, I take 8 million and 9 million and that's 17 million.

1816
02:36:44,203 --> 02:36:48,867
And isn't that pretty close to what we need for a police department, fire department?

1817
02:36:49,468 --> 02:36:50,369
Just throwing it out there.

1818
02:36:50,809 --> 02:36:51,169
Thank you.

1819
02:36:51,790 --> 02:36:52,130
Thank you.

1820
02:36:54,372 --> 02:36:55,473
Name and address for the record, please.

1821
02:36:56,094 --> 02:36:57,835
Robert Penta zero summit road method.

1822
02:36:57,855 --> 02:36:59,196
Mass former member of this board.

1823
02:36:59,576 --> 02:37:05,822
The path is kind of ironic about this is your projected rates this year for your water and sewer are being reduced by approximately 2.77%.

1824
02:37:08,365 --> 02:37:24,872
So if the Water and Sewer Commission has given you a 2.77 projected rate decrease for combined water and sewer, and as you said, Councilor Marks, they're sitting on $8.5 million in the surplus, why would they now want to go out and hit you with a connectivity fee on a quarterly basis?

1825
02:37:25,273 --> 02:37:32,796
And if you check any cities and towns, most of them that have a connectivity fee, it's a one-time fee, and that's it.

1826
02:37:33,496 --> 02:37:37,198
And it's at the discretion of the Director of Public Works or the Town Administrator

1827
02:37:37,617 --> 02:37:43,822
If you are a present homeowner, landowner, and you need to be reconnected, there is no charge.

1828
02:37:44,022 --> 02:37:51,487
It would be for a brand new person coming in, building a house, first time around, $50, one time fee, usually anyone.

1829
02:37:52,748 --> 02:37:55,050
Point of information, Councilor DelaRusso.

1830
02:37:55,270 --> 02:37:57,231
Was that May 2nd, committee of the whole meeting?

1831
02:37:57,371 --> 02:37:59,573
May 2nd is the meeting.

1832
02:37:59,793 --> 02:38:00,113
Thank you.

1833
02:38:01,294 --> 02:38:01,635
Thank you.

1834
02:38:01,895 --> 02:38:04,156
Thank you for interrupting me, Councilor DelaRusso.

1835
02:38:04,216 --> 02:38:04,917
I appreciate that.

1836
02:38:05,811 --> 02:38:07,392
Is there anything else you want to do before I finish?

1837
02:38:08,192 --> 02:38:09,352
Put your smile on your face.

1838
02:38:09,372 --> 02:38:11,713
You know, let me tell you something.

1839
02:38:11,933 --> 02:38:15,755
You know, when somebody's speaking up here, I don't need to be interrupted rudely.

1840
02:38:15,835 --> 02:38:16,595
Okay.

1841
02:38:16,975 --> 02:38:17,815
Thank you.

1842
02:38:18,095 --> 02:38:18,395
Okay.

1843
02:38:18,636 --> 02:38:19,556
And that's the problem.

1844
02:38:19,736 --> 02:38:26,538
When people view something like this on the council floor and they watch it on television, that doesn't bode very well for you folks sitting here.

1845
02:38:27,139 --> 02:38:29,880
I just think it's a shame.

1846
02:38:29,920 --> 02:38:30,720
Point of order.

1847
02:38:30,920 --> 02:38:31,620
Point of order.

1848
02:38:31,860 --> 02:38:33,561
Stick to the subject matter on the agenda, please.

1849
02:38:33,781 --> 02:38:34,041
Thank you.

1850
02:38:35,804 --> 02:38:39,103
The point of order is talking about how this council is going to react.

1851
02:38:40,182 --> 02:38:46,245
with the rate increase of a connectivity fee that you're going to be putting on the taxpayers if it comes to be presented before you.

1852
02:38:46,605 --> 02:38:48,426
I don't think you need to wait until May 2nd.

1853
02:38:48,726 --> 02:38:53,829
I think your vote should take place here tonight, that you're not going to approve it, and you're not going to be supportive of it.

1854
02:38:54,709 --> 02:38:56,130
We have a meeting on May 2nd.

1855
02:38:56,190 --> 02:39:02,653
Mr. President, you have an $8.5 million surplus, and you have a projected rate decrease in your water and sewer rate.

1856
02:39:03,093 --> 02:39:05,695
Now, you go out and explain that to the ratepayer of this community.

1857
02:39:05,715 --> 02:39:06,655
We have a meeting on May 2nd.

1858
02:39:06,735 --> 02:39:07,195
Wait a minute.

1859
02:39:07,235 --> 02:39:08,016
Please answer me.

1860
02:39:08,596 --> 02:39:14,499
Explain to me, how do you have a rate decrease when you want to charge a new increase?

1861
02:39:15,379 --> 02:39:16,539
You have the CPA.

1862
02:39:16,720 --> 02:39:18,040
It will be explained on May 2nd.

1863
02:39:18,060 --> 02:39:19,821
You have the CPA as a corollary tax.

1864
02:39:19,881 --> 02:39:20,921
On May 2nd.

1865
02:39:20,961 --> 02:39:21,622
I understand that.

1866
02:39:21,642 --> 02:39:23,302
You have a corollary tax, the CPA.

1867
02:39:23,642 --> 02:39:26,464
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts is not even going to meet it, not even match it.

1868
02:39:26,924 --> 02:39:29,585
You should not be charging the taxpayers that money.

1869
02:39:29,625 --> 02:39:31,286
It was voted on by the citizens.

1870
02:39:31,606 --> 02:39:33,927
And the citizens and you guys can make a representative.

1871
02:39:33,947 --> 02:39:34,567
Order, Mr. President.

1872
02:39:35,287 --> 02:39:36,448
We have order here.

1873
02:39:37,068 --> 02:39:42,212
You know what the order was when you and Counselor DelaRusso ran around when the people were talking?

1874
02:39:42,292 --> 02:39:44,254
You know something, Mr. President?

1875
02:39:45,055 --> 02:39:54,462
You know, trying to keep order with some folks who were just intentionally—they have no sense of respect.

1876
02:39:54,502 --> 02:39:56,544
They have no respect for people at the podium.

1877
02:39:56,564 --> 02:40:01,889
I understand that, Mr. President, but I do have the podium right now, and I have an opportunity to say what I want to say.

1878
02:40:02,909 --> 02:40:04,390
Okay, and I'm sticking to the subject matter.

1879
02:40:04,590 --> 02:40:06,390
And the subject matter is the water, okay?

1880
02:40:06,570 --> 02:40:13,212
And I'm saying to you as president of this council, your message back to the Water and Soil Commission should be, we are not going to be any supportive of it.

1881
02:40:13,512 --> 02:40:20,114
When Councilmarks gets the minutes of that meeting and they find out how and why they want to keep taxing the people of this community, it's you folks.

1882
02:40:20,454 --> 02:40:21,975
Your election is coming up this year.

1883
02:40:22,255 --> 02:40:23,635
You guys are going to be paying for it.

1884
02:40:24,255 --> 02:40:28,677
Again, May 2nd, all your questions can be answered then.

1885
02:40:29,057 --> 02:40:29,357
Thank you.

1886
02:40:30,799 --> 02:40:31,880
Name and address of the record, please.

1887
02:40:31,900 --> 02:40:34,242
Greetings, Mr. President Caviello.

1888
02:40:35,162 --> 02:40:39,025
Andrew Castaneda, Cushing Street, Medford, Massachusetts.

1889
02:40:40,086 --> 02:40:41,027
How do I start?

1890
02:40:41,807 --> 02:40:43,428
I'll make it very- You're talking about the water.

1891
02:40:44,249 --> 02:40:45,810
Yeah, I'm talking about water.

1892
02:40:46,191 --> 02:40:46,951
That's where we're starting.

1893
02:40:47,011 --> 02:40:48,612
If you're not talking about the water, don't start anything.

1894
02:40:48,632 --> 02:40:49,473
Is it free water?

1895
02:40:50,754 --> 02:40:52,375
There's something in the water, 02155.

1896
02:40:52,956 --> 02:40:54,457
I got my t-shirt.

1897
02:40:54,877 --> 02:40:55,878
It's about the water.

1898
02:40:56,378 --> 02:40:57,019
Listen, Richard.

1899
02:40:58,500 --> 02:40:58,700
Okay.

1900
02:41:00,731 --> 02:41:03,953
This connectivity fee, it's all new to me, Councilor Marks.

1901
02:41:04,314 --> 02:41:12,399
I'd ask you to explain it, but it's kind of late, and some people want to go watch that basketball game, although the only last two minutes is what really counts, in my opinion.

1902
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:24,388
However, this connectivity fee might be something that might, how you say it, the straw that breaks the taxman's back, or the taxpayer's back.

1903
02:41:24,948 --> 02:41:29,291
I enjoyed seeing Councilor Brianna and some other politicians

1904
02:41:29,793 --> 02:41:38,735
Yesterday, first time that I recollect ever going to see front of Captain Isaac Hall's house and celebrating our first revolution.

1905
02:41:40,115 --> 02:41:40,435
Thank you.

1906
02:41:42,816 --> 02:41:48,657
I guess the Beatles would say, if you walk the streets, we'll tax your feet, because I'm the taxpayer.

1907
02:41:49,577 --> 02:41:50,457
When does this end?

1908
02:41:51,377 --> 02:41:52,138
At De La Russo's?

1909
02:41:53,138 --> 02:41:53,938
Or Ching Cardi's?

1910
02:41:55,153 --> 02:41:56,414
or a cremation of some sort.

1911
02:41:56,695 --> 02:42:00,717
If we're going to talk about the water, we talk about the water.

1912
02:42:00,737 --> 02:42:02,719
We're not going to talk about anybody's business.

1913
02:42:02,739 --> 02:42:04,880
Who polluted the harbor talking about water?

1914
02:42:05,361 --> 02:42:05,601
Me?

1915
02:42:05,761 --> 02:42:05,961
You?

1916
02:42:06,322 --> 02:42:06,482
No.

1917
02:42:06,722 --> 02:42:10,565
The Mills and Lawrence, the GE, the corporations in Woburn.

1918
02:42:11,385 --> 02:42:12,186
Who's cleaning it up?

1919
02:42:13,607 --> 02:42:14,508
The lower middle class.

1920
02:42:15,088 --> 02:42:15,788
It's paid for.

1921
02:42:15,848 --> 02:42:16,289
It's done.

1922
02:42:16,929 --> 02:42:17,810
Why are we still paying?

1923
02:42:19,471 --> 02:42:22,773
May 2nd, you can ask all the questions you want at the Water and Soil Commission.

1924
02:42:22,933 --> 02:42:24,013
Ask all the questions we want.

1925
02:42:24,033 --> 02:42:26,194
If you ask me a question, I'll tell you no lies.

1926
02:42:26,654 --> 02:42:27,174
Thank you, sir.

1927
02:42:27,235 --> 02:42:27,655
Thank you.

1928
02:42:29,195 --> 02:42:40,801
On to question by Councilor Marks, as amended by... Do you have any more amendments you want to add on to that?

1929
02:42:43,976 --> 02:42:45,657
So I have a copy of the minutes will be there.

1930
02:42:46,018 --> 02:42:49,941
Ron Baker will be there and we'll, and we'll have someone from the administration also be there.

1931
02:42:50,922 --> 02:42:51,482
Is that correct?

1932
02:42:52,363 --> 02:42:52,823
Anything else?

1933
02:42:57,507 --> 02:42:59,909
If they want, if they want to answer ahead of time, they can answer.

1934
02:42:59,929 --> 02:43:07,695
Uh, but May 2nd, hopefully we can get all those questions answered on the motion by counselor marks.

1935
02:43:07,835 --> 02:43:08,656
Counselor Falco.

1936
02:43:09,116 --> 02:43:12,559
It'd be nice if you could get those answers ahead of time.

1937
02:43:12,901 --> 02:43:14,782
It'd be nice to go into the meeting prepared.

1938
02:43:15,003 --> 02:43:15,663
We'll do our best.

1939
02:43:15,683 --> 02:43:16,164
Thank you.

1940
02:43:16,364 --> 02:43:17,805
We will request those.

1941
02:43:18,165 --> 02:43:21,768
Hopefully they will come before the meeting.

1942
02:43:21,788 --> 02:43:23,489
You're trying to digest it during the meeting.

1943
02:43:23,529 --> 02:43:24,570
I think we're all in agreement with that.

1944
02:43:24,590 --> 02:43:26,732
If we get it before the meeting, it'd be greatly appreciated.

1945
02:43:26,752 --> 02:43:27,052
Thank you.

1946
02:43:27,132 --> 02:43:27,452
Thank you.

1947
02:43:29,134 --> 02:43:34,077
On the motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by by Councilor Falco.

1948
02:43:34,097 --> 02:43:34,758
All those in favor.

1949
02:43:36,319 --> 02:43:37,200
Motion passes 17.

1950
02:43:42,021 --> 02:43:57,307
being resolved that the Memphis City Council request that the administration to examine the feasibility of requiring EpiPens and EpiTraining to the city's first responders.

1951
02:43:57,968 --> 02:43:58,748
Councilor Knight.

1952
02:43:59,268 --> 02:44:00,709
Mr. President, thank you very much.

1953
02:44:01,209 --> 02:44:07,872
Being a father of children with allergies and understanding the severity thereof, in looking at all of these issues,

1954
02:44:08,769 --> 02:44:11,530
the past few weeks, what's going on in the community.

1955
02:44:11,630 --> 02:44:17,013
We have our first responders whose job is to save people's lives, carrying Narcan.

1956
02:44:18,094 --> 02:44:29,019
We have our first responders right now reviewing a request that this council made to have defibrillators as part of their first response packets.

1957
02:44:29,728 --> 02:44:38,792
And this is an effort to build upon that, Mr. President, and to ask the administration to examine the feasibility of requiring EpiPens and EpiPen training for our first responders.

1958
02:44:38,872 --> 02:44:42,994
As we all know, when you come into a situation related to allergies, every second counts.

1959
02:44:43,594 --> 02:44:46,636
And most times, the police cars get there before the ambulances do.

1960
02:44:47,256 --> 02:44:53,339
And if, in fact, there's a feasible way to provide this training and this product to our

1961
02:44:53,874 --> 02:44:56,576
First responders, I think, will be making Medford a safer place.

1962
02:44:56,797 --> 02:45:02,982
And I don't think there's anybody behind this rail that can argue that our first job isn't to have a focus on public safety, Mr. President.

1963
02:45:03,022 --> 02:45:05,024
We're making great strides in that regard.

1964
02:45:05,945 --> 02:45:10,409
And I think that this is just an opportunity for us to expand upon the services that we provide our citizenry.

1965
02:45:10,489 --> 02:45:13,011
And I'd ask that my colleagues behind the rail support this measure.

1966
02:45:13,312 --> 02:45:13,652
Thank you.

1967
02:45:14,613 --> 02:45:15,574
Councilor Lungo-Kran.

1968
02:45:16,715 --> 02:45:18,076
Thank you, President Carviello.

1969
02:45:18,096 --> 02:45:20,438
I want to thank Councilor

1970
02:45:21,492 --> 02:45:22,452
for bringing this forward.

1971
02:45:22,492 --> 02:45:23,873
I actually saw it on the news.

1972
02:45:24,753 --> 02:45:28,675
A young child from Walpole was being rushed to the hospital.

1973
02:45:29,455 --> 02:45:32,676
Oh, no, actually, maybe that's where you got it.

1974
02:45:33,636 --> 02:45:38,298
EMT came and saved his life with an EpiPen, and they said, thank God the EMTs got there.

1975
02:45:38,758 --> 02:45:39,979
We're the first responders.

1976
02:45:40,139 --> 02:45:42,860
And it's a big push by a woman in Walpole.

1977
02:45:42,900 --> 02:45:49,542
I think she's getting help by a couple of state representatives in that area to change the law of the state.

1978
02:45:49,991 --> 02:45:56,557
but I think this is a great resolve put forward by Councillor Knight to implement it in Medford sooner than later.

1979
02:45:57,898 --> 02:46:14,353
So many children and adults and anybody any age have these allergies where EpiPens are being more and more administered and needed and I think if somebody can save a life of somebody who's going into anaphylactic shock, it's going

1980
02:46:15,615 --> 02:46:20,436
I know there's going to have to be training that's going to need to be need to take place, but it's going to be worth it.

1981
02:46:20,816 --> 02:46:22,297
So I second the resolve.

1982
02:46:22,497 --> 02:46:24,497
Thank you.

1983
02:46:24,557 --> 02:46:38,681
Also, Mr. President, I know we've all seen in the news the drastic price increases of EpiPens and individuals that are on fixed incomes may have a little bit of a difficult time purchasing these materials, especially if they're without insurance.

1984
02:46:39,581 --> 02:46:43,242
So one of my fears is that individuals that

1985
02:46:43,834 --> 02:46:47,655
You know, I have allergies that require an EpiPen when they have a reaction.

1986
02:46:48,155 --> 02:46:50,736
I'm going to use that as an area to save costs.

1987
02:46:51,296 --> 02:46:58,418
And if someone's trying to trim their budget and they haven't used their EpiPen in two or three years and it's expired, they might say, well, I'm pretty good at watching the nuts.

1988
02:46:58,458 --> 02:47:02,419
I don't think I need it, which is going to create a worse situation, Mr. President.

1989
02:47:02,459 --> 02:47:06,960
So I, again, thank Councilor Longo for her kind words and move for approval.

1990
02:47:07,320 --> 02:47:08,220
Thank you.

1991
02:47:09,120 --> 02:47:11,481
And I have a grandson that has an allergy and

1992
02:47:12,065 --> 02:47:15,467
Epi pens are $600 a piece and not covered by insurance.

1993
02:47:16,267 --> 02:47:18,068
And we, he takes one to school.

1994
02:47:18,448 --> 02:47:24,632
Yeah, I went home and my daughter was out, uh, $1,800 on three Epi pens that you only get a year on.

1995
02:47:24,672 --> 02:47:30,095
So again, uh, they are quite expensive and insurance should cover them, but they don't.

1996
02:47:30,695 --> 02:47:36,318
On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Lococo, all those in favor.

1997
02:47:37,258 --> 02:47:38,079
Motion passes.

1998
02:47:40,489 --> 02:47:57,435
Petitions, excuse me, one more, 17369, offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved, the Board of Health examine the feasibility of establishing a grading system for establishments licensed to sell food products.

1999
02:47:58,155 --> 02:47:58,815
Councilor Knight.

2000
02:47:59,275 --> 02:48:01,036
Mr. President, thank you very much.

2001
02:48:01,216 --> 02:48:07,378
This is a program or a process or a policy that's in place in many communities around the United States of America.

2002
02:48:08,151 --> 02:48:15,476
think about the first time I saw it, I think I was in California when I saw this establishment has been rated a B plus by the Board of Health and its inspection.

2003
02:48:16,296 --> 02:48:19,679
There are other establishments that were C's and other establishments that were A's.

2004
02:48:19,879 --> 02:48:32,647
And what the Board of Health is doing is conducting their food inspections and then making an assessment based upon a certain policy or protocol they put in place to give a grade to that establishment with the hopes that it produces corrective action, Mr. President.

2005
02:48:32,667 --> 02:48:38,111
We'd like to have every food establishment here in the city of Medford meeting every requirement that the Board of Health puts forward.

2006
02:48:38,850 --> 02:48:50,296
So we'll see cities like New York City, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and most recently I believe the city of Boston adopted a system where they're grading establishments based upon the results of their food inspections.

2007
02:48:50,356 --> 02:48:54,178
And I think that this is really a great act to protect the consumer.

2008
02:48:55,340 --> 02:49:15,096
I don't want the policy to create an increased burden on operators or business owners here in the community, but I think that if we sell good products and the city is behind the fact that a business is selling a good product, that we'll have more customers in that business because the city and the government entity has made an effort to further regulate it and to make sure that they're complying by all the rules.

2009
02:49:15,116 --> 02:49:16,797
And then we're telling people they're complying by the rules.

2010
02:49:16,817 --> 02:49:20,360
So I know we have Mr. Pinter at the rail here.

2011
02:49:20,440 --> 02:49:22,542
I thought Mr. McKillop was going to get up because he's a

2012
02:49:22,947 --> 02:49:24,348
He's a business owner and a restaurant owner.

2013
02:49:25,008 --> 02:49:33,832
However, this is a measure that I'd like to get a report back from the Board of Health on as to whether or not this is something that they find feasible and find out if it'll work in the city of Medford, Mr. President.

2014
02:49:33,872 --> 02:49:35,533
So I'd ask my colleagues to support it and move approval.

2015
02:49:36,093 --> 02:49:37,194
Name and address of the record, please.

2016
02:49:37,414 --> 02:49:39,375
Robert Pantazero, Summit Road, Medford, Mass.

2017
02:49:39,715 --> 02:49:46,578
Number one, I would be opposed to this bill if I was sitting on that side of the rail because, number one, I think this is an infringement upon the free enterprise system.

2018
02:49:46,918 --> 02:49:48,439
The Board of Health has a job to do.

2019
02:49:48,659 --> 02:49:51,561
They go out there, they review the product of the restaurant,

2020
02:49:52,746 --> 02:49:54,307
or whatever it might be, that's their job.

2021
02:49:54,707 --> 02:50:02,870
And for them to start taking an arbitrary and capricious action by placing a A, B, or C on the type of business that's taking place, who are they?

2022
02:50:02,910 --> 02:50:04,070
They don't frequent that business.

2023
02:50:04,130 --> 02:50:08,312
And I think it would lead a very, uh, it would, it would skew.

2024
02:50:08,953 --> 02:50:13,055
to public to go into a certain direction to say one business might be better than another.

2025
02:50:13,075 --> 02:50:16,477
You know, this is just as bad as municipal aggregation.

2026
02:50:16,817 --> 02:50:26,101
You know, you're asking city government to get involved in people's lives, their personal lives, and in this situation, their personal life is a personal business.

2027
02:50:27,102 --> 02:50:32,124
The proposal that's before us is for the Board of Health to examine whether or not this would be a feasible approach.

2028
02:50:32,697 --> 02:50:41,784
And what it is is not to have the Board of Health get involved into the business operations of a business, but to report to the general public that the facility that they're going to eat and purchase food from is clean.

2029
02:50:42,445 --> 02:50:42,785
Thank you.

2030
02:50:43,545 --> 02:50:57,677
When they go and do their job and they review a restaurant and they get a certificate on there that says it's been approved, whether it's a milk license, a common ventures license, or any kind of food product license, that's the city or the town telling you that that place has passed the test.

2031
02:50:57,957 --> 02:51:00,138
They don't need to have a rating system.

2032
02:51:01,087 --> 02:51:08,591
When you start getting into a rating system, well, maybe we should have departments come down here and rate you guys and girls on the performance of your jobs, OK?

2033
02:51:09,231 --> 02:51:11,933
You're really crossing over the line on something like this.

2034
02:51:12,533 --> 02:51:14,374
You have a department that does its job.

2035
02:51:14,754 --> 02:51:20,857
And its job is to go out there and to ensure that the food product in the business is safe, it's good to eat,

2036
02:51:22,935 --> 02:51:23,536
And so be it.

2037
02:51:24,036 --> 02:51:27,939
And now if you're going to start putting a rating system on it, I think you're really crossing over the line.

2038
02:51:28,119 --> 02:51:32,803
You know, people spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to go into a food business.

2039
02:51:33,403 --> 02:51:38,147
And if that person upstairs, man or female, who happens to work for the health department, just doesn't

2040
02:51:38,707 --> 02:51:41,608
They might pass the test, but they may not like the person.

2041
02:51:41,848 --> 02:51:43,649
You're getting into a personality conflict.

2042
02:51:43,869 --> 02:51:53,152
How many times have you folks gotten phone calls from people that have a business because they don't like a department head that comes in there and gives them a hard time?

2043
02:51:53,452 --> 02:51:54,932
And it's a personality conflict.

2044
02:51:55,132 --> 02:51:56,533
It's got nothing to do with the business.

2045
02:51:57,173 --> 02:52:06,455
I would strongly suggest that this does not go forward and you leave it just the way it is as a private sector business person coming to the city and applying for their license.

2046
02:52:06,495 --> 02:52:10,216
However it is, they go there, they do their job, but their business takes care of itself.

2047
02:52:10,576 --> 02:52:13,417
Their product sold to the public will take care of itself.

2048
02:52:13,697 --> 02:52:20,079
We don't need any city administration telling a business person that owns a restaurant how they should be rated by this city.

2049
02:52:20,259 --> 02:52:20,599
Thank you.

2050
02:52:21,339 --> 02:52:21,939
Councilor Layton.

2051
02:52:23,999 --> 02:52:25,620
We all do things a certain way.

2052
02:52:26,795 --> 02:52:28,417
And we could all do things better, Mr. President.

2053
02:52:28,677 --> 02:52:37,786
And all this is is an opportunity for us to ask the Board of Health whether or not we're doing things the right way, and if it's feasible to do it a different way, and if that different way is going to be better.

2054
02:52:38,146 --> 02:52:39,788
I don't think it's something we need to yell and scream about.

2055
02:52:40,108 --> 02:52:40,449
Thank you.

2056
02:52:41,510 --> 02:52:42,531
Name and address of the record, please.

2057
02:52:44,090 --> 02:52:49,053
Dave McKillop, 94 Rockland Road, and I do own a restaurant, and I was hesitant to come up.

2058
02:52:49,253 --> 02:52:50,074
I'm not going to lie.

2059
02:52:50,094 --> 02:52:51,534
I know you did.

2060
02:52:52,675 --> 02:52:55,076
There's two rules of thought here.

2061
02:52:56,257 --> 02:53:03,581
The city that I work in, I have an incredible rapport with the department and Larry, the head of the department.

2062
02:53:04,802 --> 02:53:06,323
So we work in tandem.

2063
02:53:07,204 --> 02:53:08,785
He comes in, it's a surprise.

2064
02:53:08,925 --> 02:53:10,025
I never know when they're coming.

2065
02:53:10,445 --> 02:53:22,788
There are things that, totally honestly, that they will find that are incredible, and then there are things that they will find that might have slipped through the cracks, whether it's a thermometer that isn't working or something that isn't quite shelved properly.

2066
02:53:23,629 --> 02:53:25,049
But they work really, really hard with

2067
02:53:25,971 --> 02:53:27,413
us as a community.

2068
02:53:28,013 --> 02:53:34,720
And if you work really, really hard with the Board of Health, there's a respect level there that carries very well.

2069
02:53:35,241 --> 02:53:42,448
Now, I can't speak for what goes on in Medford as far as the rapport between the Board of Health and Medford and the restaurateurs.

2070
02:53:43,369 --> 02:53:44,931
I can only tell you that that's something that

2071
02:53:45,433 --> 02:53:54,075
you know, as a whole, you would look at and see the reports and evaluate the situation and make a decision as to does this make sense for us?

2072
02:53:54,115 --> 02:54:00,737
Should we step up to the plate and do something a little bit different because it's not quite working the way we'd like to based off of the information we have?

2073
02:54:01,277 --> 02:54:03,738
That's kind of the way I personally would approach it.

2074
02:54:04,978 --> 02:54:11,080
If I remember correctly, the grading method was based or actually came about

2075
02:54:12,113 --> 02:54:15,534
do specifically because of the chain businesses.

2076
02:54:16,354 --> 02:54:20,696
Because the chain businesses were the ones that were having a real difficult time staying on top of things.

2077
02:54:21,596 --> 02:54:27,778
Because when you go to franchises or you go to district managers, regional managers, then store managers, then assistant managers,

2078
02:54:28,200 --> 02:54:31,062
It's very, very difficult to kind of maintain a certain level of control.

2079
02:54:31,422 --> 02:54:33,964
And that's kind of where that kind of came from and morphed out of.

2080
02:54:34,364 --> 02:54:37,386
And then it kind of blanketed across and kind of kept going further.

2081
02:54:37,486 --> 02:54:48,413
And to be honest with you, to Mr. Penta's point, there are some areas that it does not work well, that it is kind of a negative kind of

2082
02:54:49,409 --> 02:54:56,273
reciprocation on the behalf of someone that may not appreciate someone else and, you know, gives them a bad score just simply because they can.

2083
02:54:56,833 --> 02:55:12,482
So it is a double-edged, it can be a double-edged sword, but I think that any community that works with the Board of Health, the restaurateurs, they recognize how important it is and the Board of Health, if they do it well, and I know in my community they do it very well,

2084
02:55:12,902 --> 02:55:16,845
They work in tandem and they work really, really hard together to make sure that everything is the way it's supposed to be.

2085
02:55:17,446 --> 02:55:19,267
So that's the only input I can give on that.

2086
02:55:19,287 --> 02:55:23,891
I don't have an opinion one way or the other as to which direction.

2087
02:55:23,931 --> 02:55:26,593
I just say, basically, collect all your data.

2088
02:55:27,234 --> 02:55:28,374
Take a look at your Board of Health.

2089
02:55:28,414 --> 02:55:35,940
And by the way, if I'm not mistaken, the Board of Health is really, it is a department within the city, but it's underneath the umbrella of the state.

2090
02:55:35,980 --> 02:55:36,701
Am I right or wrong?

2091
02:55:37,702 --> 02:55:40,304
I think in the city of Salem, that's the way that they present it.

2092
02:55:43,058 --> 02:55:54,308
Okay, just for clarification, because I wasn't quite sure, because I know that in the City of Salem, they kind of make it as the Board of Health is kind of their own entity within the city working underneath the state, no?

2093
02:55:54,428 --> 02:55:56,369
Okay, so maybe that's not the one.

2094
02:55:59,532 --> 02:56:02,835
There's a lot of things that are governed through state legislation.

2095
02:56:03,772 --> 02:56:04,813
eliminates local control.

2096
02:56:05,193 --> 02:56:08,275
So the answer to that is yes and no, I guess.

2097
02:56:08,575 --> 02:56:10,117
That's kind of the way, the approach I would make.

2098
02:56:10,457 --> 02:56:14,039
And you do have to be careful when anything, anything has to do with something like that.

2099
02:56:14,099 --> 02:56:14,880
So thank you.

2100
02:56:15,080 --> 02:56:15,801
Thank you for your retreat.

2101
02:56:15,821 --> 02:56:16,421
Thank you, Mr. Coats.

2102
02:56:17,001 --> 02:56:17,522
Sorry about that.

2103
02:56:18,142 --> 02:56:19,403
Council vice president box.

2104
02:56:20,604 --> 02:56:21,605
Thank you, Mr. President.

2105
02:56:21,985 --> 02:56:23,686
I believe it was about six months ago.

2106
02:56:23,706 --> 02:56:30,711
Uh, during the council meeting, uh, we had the new border health inspector, uh, before us.

2107
02:56:30,791 --> 02:56:33,313
And I asked the new health director,

2108
02:56:34,174 --> 02:56:39,098
uh, where do we stand with, um, border health inspections?

2109
02:56:39,898 --> 02:56:42,860
And I believe they were seven or eight months behind.

2110
02:56:43,921 --> 02:56:48,964
And the reason why I knew that is because I had a number of businesses that said, what do I do?

2111
02:56:48,984 --> 02:56:53,007
My board, my health inspection ran out six months ago.

2112
02:56:53,327 --> 02:56:55,028
Can I still operate my business?

2113
02:56:55,489 --> 02:56:57,630
And that's why I asked the question, Mr. President.

2114
02:56:58,251 --> 02:56:58,751
And you know,

2115
02:56:59,431 --> 02:57:02,833
I think the larger question is, what are we doing right now?

2116
02:57:02,853 --> 02:57:05,094
Are we up to date with our health inspections?

2117
02:57:05,694 --> 02:57:07,595
Do we need more staff in the office?

2118
02:57:08,236 --> 02:57:09,896
To me, that's the larger question.

2119
02:57:10,357 --> 02:57:21,142
If we want to create a rating system, which I'll be quite honest with you, I don't know if I'm opposed or not to it, but if we want to create a rating system, that's to make sure at least we're doing our due diligence.

2120
02:57:21,522 --> 02:57:34,654
and making sure we have the appropriate staff, and making sure our business has their inspections in a timely fashion, so they don't have to wonder whether or not they have to close their door because they don't have a border health inspection.

2121
02:57:35,115 --> 02:57:37,597
So I think that's the larger issue, Mr. President.

2122
02:57:38,201 --> 02:57:58,352
I'm not willing to vote on any paper tonight to move any issue forward, Mr. President, until we find out where we stand with the Board of Health, where we stand on with the inspections, and why is it taking so long for our health department to inspect these businesses in the community, because as we all know, as Councilor Penta mentioned,

2123
02:57:58,712 --> 02:58:07,035
that the Board of Health goes out there and makes sure that the businesses are adhering to code, state and city safety codes.

2124
02:58:07,495 --> 02:58:08,576
That's what their business is.

2125
02:58:08,836 --> 02:58:12,077
And when you get your inspection sticker, that means you're up to par.

2126
02:58:12,357 --> 02:58:27,323
And that means the resident that's going into your restaurant knows your food is prepared in the right way, know that your preparation is right, know the heating requirements and refrigeration requirements are right, and all the cleanliness stuff that goes with

2127
02:58:27,699 --> 02:58:28,939
a border health inspection.

2128
02:58:30,180 --> 02:58:32,421
So that is important, Mr. President.

2129
02:58:33,341 --> 02:58:46,106
At this point, grading a business, I think we've got to go back to fundamentals in this city and making sure we provide the basics, which is a timely border health inspection for all our businesses.

2130
02:58:46,646 --> 02:58:51,908
So I'd like to see that happen first, Mr. President, before I vote on- Would you like to amend the paper to-

2131
02:58:53,728 --> 02:58:58,870
get a report from the Board of Health on where we stand with all the inspections in the city?

2132
02:58:59,931 --> 02:59:03,172
We asked for it, and I believe she gave us a verbal at the podium.

2133
02:59:03,572 --> 02:59:15,076
And honestly, I don't remember the exacts, but I want to say that 30 or 40% of our businesses back some six months ago didn't receive their Board of Health inspection, and they were in the process of doing so.

2134
02:59:15,656 --> 02:59:17,276
So if we could get an update, that'd be helpful.

2135
02:59:17,296 --> 02:59:21,638
Mr. Clerk, if you could please put down that if the Board of Health can give us an update on

2136
02:59:22,076 --> 02:59:26,059
and where we stand with businesses getting their license renewals.

2137
02:59:28,321 --> 02:59:36,387
On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Lococo.

2138
02:59:36,427 --> 02:59:39,229
President Carriello, I think it's a good discussion.

2139
02:59:39,269 --> 02:59:41,731
Maybe we should have with the Board of Health.

2140
02:59:41,811 --> 02:59:42,812
Maybe we can do that.

2141
02:59:42,832 --> 02:59:44,073
Through a proposal.

2142
02:59:44,853 --> 02:59:49,917
Well, through a proposal or we could just talk to the Board of Health at budget time, see where they're at.

2143
02:59:50,452 --> 02:59:56,313
kind of talk about everything at the same time, give it a little extra time with the Board of Health before we move on anything tonight.

2144
02:59:57,233 --> 02:59:59,134
I mean, I see both sides.

2145
02:59:59,274 --> 03:00:02,554
I agree with Councilor Marks, but I understand the point of it.

2146
03:00:02,654 --> 03:00:12,957
So maybe just to have a discussion about it rather than, or definitely get some more clarity of what we're actually asking the Board of Health to report back to us on.

2147
03:00:14,917 --> 03:00:15,577
Councilor Knight.

2148
03:00:18,338 --> 03:00:19,718
The Board of Health could very simply say,

2149
03:00:20,123 --> 03:00:20,843
It's not feasible.

2150
03:00:20,883 --> 03:00:21,503
We don't want to do it.

2151
03:00:22,423 --> 03:00:23,004
It is feasible.

2152
03:00:23,044 --> 03:00:23,604
We can do it.

2153
03:00:24,044 --> 03:00:25,304
All we're doing is asking them a question.

2154
03:00:25,644 --> 03:00:26,244
I don't see the harm.

2155
03:00:27,344 --> 03:00:30,525
On the motion by Councilor Knight as amended by Councilor Marks.

2156
03:00:37,506 --> 03:00:42,907
If the Port of Health is going to put that little thought into it, then I don't even think it's worth asking the question.

2157
03:00:43,707 --> 03:00:46,127
If they sit back and say, well, we can't do it.

2158
03:00:46,568 --> 03:00:48,308
That's not even worth asking the question.

2159
03:00:48,328 --> 03:00:49,288
Or if they sit back and say,

2160
03:00:49,605 --> 03:00:50,265
We can do it.

2161
03:00:50,705 --> 03:00:51,966
I'd like to know why they can do it.

2162
03:00:51,986 --> 03:00:53,406
I'd like to know if they have the personnel.

2163
03:00:53,826 --> 03:01:00,508
Knowing the fact that they can't get to their regularly scheduled health visits now, how are they going to be able to take this on?

2164
03:01:01,148 --> 03:01:02,929
They're in a depleted staff up there.

2165
03:01:03,649 --> 03:01:04,989
So I think there's more to this.

2166
03:01:05,049 --> 03:01:08,270
I'm not saying it's not a bad idea, but I just think there's more to it.

2167
03:01:08,951 --> 03:01:10,571
And, you know, if it comes from the council,

2168
03:01:10,947 --> 03:01:12,328
And we're saying, will you look into this?

2169
03:01:12,808 --> 03:01:14,970
Then it may mushroom into something else.

2170
03:01:15,530 --> 03:01:19,954
And we're going to be sitting there saying, well, we didn't want you to go that far with it.

2171
03:01:20,194 --> 03:01:21,855
We didn't want you to move that far.

2172
03:01:22,255 --> 03:01:27,479
Because as far as I'm concerned, once this takes place, this will be an administrative policy.

2173
03:01:28,240 --> 03:01:31,923
I don't see this as a city ordinance, unless Councilor Knight sees it differently.

2174
03:01:32,263 --> 03:01:34,104
I see this as an administrative policy.

2175
03:01:34,585 --> 03:01:36,186
And that's not under our purview.

2176
03:01:36,666 --> 03:01:40,549
So we may initiate the ball rolling and not be able to stop that ball.

2177
03:01:41,024 --> 03:01:56,733
And I'm not prepared to do that at this point, not knowing where we stand with the Board of Health presence in our community, the staffing, and the fact that they're not fully equipped to get out in a timely fashion for inspections.

2178
03:01:57,874 --> 03:01:58,254
Thank you.

2179
03:01:58,314 --> 03:01:58,955
Councilor Nice.

2180
03:02:00,075 --> 03:02:02,076
There are two ways to look at every issue, Mr. President.

2181
03:02:02,116 --> 03:02:05,558
We can look at issues as to why we can't do things, and we can look at issues as to why we can't.

2182
03:02:06,519 --> 03:02:08,100
And all I'm doing is asking a question.

2183
03:02:08,200 --> 03:02:09,701
I'd like the support of my council colleagues,

2184
03:02:10,670 --> 03:02:12,011
and that's all I have to say about it.

2185
03:02:12,031 --> 03:02:12,352
Thank you.

2186
03:02:13,552 --> 03:02:18,956
On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor De La Russo.

2187
03:02:20,137 --> 03:02:20,978
All those in favor.

2188
03:02:24,120 --> 03:02:26,302
Roll call vote has been requested.

2189
03:02:29,604 --> 03:02:30,525
Councilor De La Russo.

2190
03:02:30,705 --> 03:02:30,885
Yes.

2191
03:02:31,686 --> 03:02:32,407
Councilor Falcone.

2192
03:02:32,727 --> 03:02:32,927
Yes.

2193
03:02:33,647 --> 03:02:34,208
Councilor Knight.

2194
03:02:34,388 --> 03:02:34,608
Yes.

2195
03:02:35,989 --> 03:02:36,730
Councilor Lockern.

2196
03:02:36,750 --> 03:02:36,810
Yes.

2197
03:02:38,985 --> 03:02:39,745
Vice President Marks.

2198
03:02:40,906 --> 03:02:41,606
Councilor Scarpelli.

2199
03:02:41,626 --> 03:02:41,706
Yes.

2200
03:02:42,986 --> 03:02:43,687
President Caviello.

2201
03:02:43,787 --> 03:02:44,027
Yes.

2202
03:02:44,907 --> 03:02:45,827
Four in the affirmative.

2203
03:02:48,889 --> 03:02:55,991
Five in the affirmative, two in the negative.

2204
03:02:56,411 --> 03:02:57,572
Motion passes.

2205
03:02:58,592 --> 03:02:59,292
Petitions.

2206
03:03:01,593 --> 03:03:02,173
As amended.

2207
03:03:03,594 --> 03:03:06,295
Petitions, presentations and similar matters.

2208
03:03:08,375 --> 03:03:20,172
17373, petition by Robert L. Capucci, Jr., 71 Evans Street, Medford, to address the council concerning municipal aggregation.

2209
03:03:21,141 --> 03:03:22,742
Name and address for the record, please.

2210
03:03:23,142 --> 03:03:24,363
Thank you, Mr. President.

2211
03:03:24,503 --> 03:03:27,725
I'm Robert Capucci, Jr., 71 Evans Street in Medford.

2212
03:03:27,805 --> 03:03:29,927
I'll try to be brief at this late hour.

2213
03:03:30,988 --> 03:03:44,457
Last summer, it was proposed that the city move towards municipal aggregation based solely on it would save the electric rate payers in Medford some money.

2214
03:03:46,298 --> 03:03:47,018
It went away.

2215
03:03:47,459 --> 03:03:49,360
Somehow it came back last Tuesday.

2216
03:03:49,929 --> 03:03:57,552
in a committee of the whole meeting under a new auspice of protecting the environment, Go Green.

2217
03:03:58,333 --> 03:04:13,199
There was a wonderful presentation brought by the company, supposedly going to be hired by Alicia Hunt, the director of energy and environment here in Medford, the chairman of the Go Green Medford community.

2218
03:04:13,980 --> 03:04:16,521
Basically, for the citizens that are watching at home,

2219
03:04:17,228 --> 03:04:32,423
It's a program whereby if passed, if it ever comes to a vote in this council and it does get passed, you're automatically opted into the city buying your power for you, your electricity, with the provision that you can opt out.

2220
03:04:34,505 --> 03:04:38,549
Understandably, what the company said last week was you can opt out at any time.

2221
03:04:39,310 --> 03:04:43,954
There was also a 30 day opt out clause in there.

2222
03:04:44,454 --> 03:04:52,981
But Councillor Marks at the committee of the whole meeting brought up the state law which is after 180 days you cannot opt out.

2223
03:04:53,341 --> 03:05:02,028
And getting into these government contracts doing things on behalf of the people, when they tell you, you know, we'll let you opt out at any time.

2224
03:05:02,872 --> 03:05:04,434
But the state losses something out.

2225
03:05:04,834 --> 03:05:21,371
I'm a little bit skeptical of the whole process I if they if this is really such a good thing They should present it and market it to the people as an as an opt-in if they want to not Force everybody all at once to be a part of this system.

2226
03:05:21,471 --> 03:05:23,193
I mean, that's a slippery slope.

2227
03:05:23,233 --> 03:05:23,793
Where does it end?

2228
03:05:24,054 --> 03:05:26,396
Is the City Council gonna vote that?

2229
03:05:28,064 --> 03:05:31,785
another company buys all my clothes for me, all my groceries.

2230
03:05:32,045 --> 03:05:35,766
It's, it's, it's, it's dangerous precedent that was sent setting.

2231
03:05:36,326 --> 03:05:36,926
It really is.

2232
03:05:37,326 --> 03:05:40,127
But I want to be fair to the other side.

2233
03:05:40,787 --> 03:05:47,489
Uh, councilor Della Russo at the committee of the whole meeting was a very astute and bringing up, I would like opposition to this.

2234
03:05:47,949 --> 03:05:53,970
So I emailed everybody on this council, the citizens against municipal aggregation website.

2235
03:05:54,431 --> 03:05:56,171
I also included the mayor and,

2236
03:05:56,858 --> 03:05:59,679
Alicia hunt, the director of environment and engineer.

2237
03:06:00,179 --> 03:06:06,062
I'm also going to reach out to them if it ever does come to a vote so that the opposite side could be heard.

2238
03:06:06,722 --> 03:06:17,127
I just find it just comforting that the city would entertain a notion of doing something on behalf of every resident.

2239
03:06:18,454 --> 03:06:22,979
from reading the CAMA website, it doesn't always work.

2240
03:06:23,420 --> 03:06:35,153
And if you are locked into it and they say you can get out, but on that 181st day you do try to get out, for some reason you can't, and a lower rate comes, I mean, you can go to the two sources now.

2241
03:06:35,213 --> 03:06:37,215
It's at Eversource and National Grid.

2242
03:06:37,616 --> 03:06:38,657
And you can click on them now.

2243
03:06:39,375 --> 03:06:42,717
And under those, a ton of other options come up.

2244
03:06:43,017 --> 03:06:45,738
There are choices for citizens to make right now.

2245
03:06:45,798 --> 03:06:51,381
They can enter into a six-month program for, say, $6.99 a kilowatt hour, or another program for $12.99.

2246
03:06:51,681 --> 03:06:59,285
That choice, which is pretty much the fundamental building block of this nation, should never be taken away.

2247
03:06:59,485 --> 03:07:00,686
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

2248
03:07:00,706 --> 03:07:00,906
Thank you.

2249
03:07:03,627 --> 03:07:06,209
Motion by Councilor Knight to receive and Mr. President file.

2250
03:07:06,229 --> 03:07:06,369
Second.

2251
03:07:06,389 --> 03:07:08,690
On the same, Mr. President,

2252
03:07:09,363 --> 03:07:10,143
Councillor Marks.

2253
03:07:11,584 --> 03:07:12,564
Thank you, Mr. President.

2254
03:07:13,304 --> 03:07:16,325
And I thank Mr. Capucci for getting up on this subject.

2255
03:07:16,385 --> 03:07:19,807
I think he hit the nail on the head when it comes to this issue.

2256
03:07:20,447 --> 03:07:27,369
Just so you know, the issue was referred to the energy subcommittee of the council.

2257
03:07:28,430 --> 03:07:32,911
And we plan on having a meeting very shortly regarding this paper.

2258
03:07:33,851 --> 03:07:38,233
But I just want to let it be known, Mr. President, that the city has been going out on its own

2259
03:07:38,897 --> 03:07:45,539
on the school side for a number of years, doing municipal aggregation on the school side.

2260
03:07:46,159 --> 03:07:57,203
And back in 2014, it was reported in the Meffitt transcript that, and the article reads, Meffitt Unplugs on electricity contract cost schools more than $100,000, Mr. President.

2261
03:08:00,151 --> 03:08:17,014
The city, when they went in and purchased on behalf of the schools, failed to renew the contract and had to go back out on the open market and wasn't able to obtain a rate like they had when they had a contract.

2262
03:08:17,374 --> 03:08:23,655
And it ended up costing the schools, which is you and I the rate payer, $100,000 because they failed to do their job.

2263
03:08:26,616 --> 03:08:33,524
So after that glowing recommendation, now they say, you know what, let's do it on behalf of every resident in this community.

2264
03:08:33,984 --> 03:08:35,086
Look at our track record.

2265
03:08:35,386 --> 03:08:39,450
Now we want to bring in every resident and we'll go out on your behalf.

2266
03:08:39,851 --> 03:08:43,595
Anytime the government wants to get involved in your business, Mr. President,

2267
03:08:43,875 --> 03:08:46,137
as far as I'm concerned, is not a win-win.

2268
03:08:46,657 --> 03:08:52,142
When the government says, we want to save you money, that should be the biggest red flag.

2269
03:08:52,162 --> 03:08:56,005
Because the government is not in business to save you or I money.

2270
03:08:56,605 --> 03:08:58,527
They're not in that business, Mr. President.

2271
03:08:58,947 --> 03:09:04,311
So this will get its proper hearing in the Energy Subcommittee, Mr. President.

2272
03:09:04,812 --> 03:09:07,013
But as far as I'm concerned, I agree with the Speaker.

2273
03:09:08,014 --> 03:09:09,796
When the state legislature created this,

2274
03:09:10,458 --> 03:09:15,221
They created a clause where it says it's voluntary in the law.

2275
03:09:15,662 --> 03:09:16,783
This is voluntary.

2276
03:09:17,123 --> 03:09:22,186
However, once your city council votes for it, it's no longer voluntary.

2277
03:09:22,687 --> 03:09:26,049
Everyone is subjected to this new municipal aggregation.

2278
03:09:26,730 --> 03:09:28,971
Then you have the ability to opt out.

2279
03:09:29,672 --> 03:09:38,378
And we all know when we changed our meters over, it took us several years just to change our meters over in this city because people weren't properly informed.

2280
03:09:39,469 --> 03:09:45,732
And to say that there'll be community outreach and so forth, they made a big mistake with the legislation.

2281
03:09:46,052 --> 03:09:47,453
They should have had it as an opt-in.

2282
03:09:47,853 --> 03:09:55,297
If you're interested, you want to go green, you want to reduce your carbon footprint, and you want to belong to this municipal aggregation, so be it.

2283
03:09:55,617 --> 03:09:57,098
And I think the city should offer it.

2284
03:09:58,083 --> 03:10:01,685
But don't include me in something, Mr. President, and say I have to opt out.

2285
03:10:02,206 --> 03:10:07,770
And then don't say, well, you know, we're going to decide how much green energy you purchase.

2286
03:10:08,270 --> 03:10:10,792
If you don't like that, you can opt out of that, too.

2287
03:10:11,672 --> 03:10:13,413
It's the big opt-out program.

2288
03:10:13,734 --> 03:10:15,495
You can opt out of that, too, Mr. President.

2289
03:10:16,416 --> 03:10:19,318
So I'm not fully sold on this, Mr. President.

2290
03:10:19,658 --> 03:10:21,539
I appreciate Mr. Capucci coming up here.

2291
03:10:22,019 --> 03:10:27,163
And like I said, this will definitely get its fair share of a hearing within

2292
03:10:27,591 --> 03:10:32,594
the Energy Committee, and it will be reported back out to this council to make a full decision.

2293
03:10:32,994 --> 03:10:34,315
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

2294
03:10:38,118 --> 03:10:40,860
Motion by Councilor Knight to receive and place on file.

2295
03:10:42,441 --> 03:10:42,521
Aye.

2296
03:10:43,701 --> 03:10:45,002
Seconded by Councilor Del Rosso.

2297
03:10:46,623 --> 03:10:48,564
All those in favor?

2298
03:10:48,585 --> 03:10:48,645
Aye.

2299
03:10:48,685 --> 03:10:51,146
Motion to take papers in the hands of the clerk.

2300
03:10:52,887 --> 03:10:55,109
Be offered by Councilor Scapelli.

2301
03:10:55,899 --> 03:11:03,583
Be it resolved that the City Council get a report from the DOT regarding the T bus stop at Main and High Street.

2302
03:11:04,644 --> 03:11:05,664
Councillor Scott Pellick.

2303
03:11:05,904 --> 03:11:06,365
If I can.

2304
03:11:07,475 --> 03:11:12,778
I did receive a few phone calls, obviously, that I've been championing this issue.

2305
03:11:14,339 --> 03:11:31,870
The last meeting we had with the Department of Transportation, they put on the full court press and the T had supervisors, enforcement, making sure that the bus stops were safe in front of Main Street and High Street.

2306
03:11:32,571 --> 03:11:36,333
I've just been contacting recently

2307
03:11:37,685 --> 03:11:43,347
And I've made it a concept to drive there and witness what's happening.

2308
03:11:43,367 --> 03:11:53,732
There's construction now being done further out, so the buses again cannot take that turn.

2309
03:11:53,872 --> 03:11:58,234
And again, waiting and pulling out off the sidewalk.

2310
03:11:58,274 --> 03:12:03,416
So if we can get a report back, because I'd like to, you know,

2311
03:12:04,045 --> 03:12:15,449
possibly move on this and, uh, and, and get the final word on, um, eliminating that bus stop until the construction is done before somebody gets, uh, seriously injured.

2312
03:12:15,549 --> 03:12:16,129
So thank you.

2313
03:12:16,349 --> 03:12:16,689
Thank you.

2314
03:12:17,329 --> 03:12:21,530
On the motion by Councilor Scott Pelley, seconded by Councilor Longo Kern.

2315
03:12:21,550 --> 03:12:25,492
All those in favor?

2316
03:12:25,692 --> 03:12:25,832
Aye.

2317
03:12:25,852 --> 03:12:27,472
17.375 offered by President Caravaglio.

2318
03:12:28,132 --> 03:12:33,074
Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council offers its condolences to the family of Giovanni

2319
03:12:33,655 --> 03:12:36,798
Gio Maggiore, who passed away this last week.

2320
03:12:37,318 --> 03:12:49,869
Gio was a son of Medford school teacher, Maya Maggiore, and it's a lot more tragic when it's a little small child that passes away, and it seems to hit home a little bit more.

2321
03:12:50,429 --> 03:12:51,970
So if we could stand for a moment of silence.

2322
03:13:01,779 --> 03:13:02,059
Thank you.

2323
03:13:04,488 --> 03:13:04,848
Records.

2324
03:13:06,129 --> 03:13:06,910
We'll pass the council.

2325
03:13:07,850 --> 03:13:08,451
Councilor Lockhart.

2326
03:13:09,532 --> 03:13:10,152
Councilor Lockhart.

2327
03:13:10,372 --> 03:13:11,473
Thank you, President Carvalho.

2328
03:13:11,513 --> 03:13:24,702
Just before we adjourn, I just want to congratulate all those who ran the Boston Marathon, especially Medford residents, including our colleague, George Scarpelli's wife, Dina, Kelly, and Chris Shields.

2329
03:13:24,802 --> 03:13:31,527
There were a number of Medford residents, and we were tracking them with our phones, so they did amazing, and it was a great, beautiful day.

2330
03:13:31,920 --> 03:13:33,102
Congratulations.

2331
03:13:33,242 --> 03:13:35,445
Again, it wasn't me that was running.

2332
03:13:36,366 --> 03:13:37,288
I was just tracking it.

2333
03:13:37,868 --> 03:13:38,710
It was my wife.

2334
03:13:39,150 --> 03:13:39,951
She did a great job.

2335
03:13:39,991 --> 03:13:40,612
Very proud of her.

2336
03:13:41,253 --> 03:13:44,217
She was exhausting but she did a heck of a job.

2337
03:13:44,398 --> 03:13:44,818
Proud of her.

2338
03:13:47,762 --> 03:13:55,166
Mr. President, I think it's also important to point out what a great job long-time Medford resident David McGillivray, Boston Marathon race director, has been doing.

2339
03:13:55,186 --> 03:13:55,746
My classmate.

2340
03:13:55,886 --> 03:13:57,307
Yes, and he's been involved.

2341
03:13:57,527 --> 03:13:57,307
1972.

2342
03:13:57,827 --> 03:14:01,669
He's been involved in this race now, I think it's for the last 40 or so years.

2343
03:14:02,289 --> 03:14:09,092
And one of the things that I heard on the radio today that was amazing to me, Mr. President, was that he's at the starting line at Hopkington when the gun goes off.

2344
03:14:09,432 --> 03:14:12,574
Then he's at the finish line on Boylston Street when the first wave comes through.

2345
03:14:12,947 --> 03:14:16,509
And then at eight o'clock at night, he's back in Hopkinton running the race himself.

2346
03:14:17,230 --> 03:14:22,914
Um, so it just shows what a commitment and what a love he has for the sport and how, uh, he's been able to turn this passion into a career.

2347
03:14:22,974 --> 03:14:24,635
And it really is inspiring.

2348
03:14:24,695 --> 03:14:26,436
So I'd like to thank Dave for all his work as well.

2349
03:14:27,076 --> 03:14:29,858
I just wanted to congratulate Dina for finishing the race.

2350
03:14:29,918 --> 03:14:30,499
Great job.

2351
03:14:30,739 --> 03:14:36,202
And, uh, also to, uh, Medford resident, uh, actually grew up here, uh, Joe LeBlanc.

2352
03:14:36,583 --> 03:14:41,486
Uh, he actually, uh, was involved in, but he grew up here in Medford and he actually ran for charity as well.

2353
03:14:41,546 --> 03:14:41,666
So.

2354
03:14:42,227 --> 03:14:43,408
Congratulations to him as well.

2355
03:14:43,548 --> 03:14:43,908
Thank you.

2356
03:14:46,790 --> 03:14:47,070
Records.

2357
03:14:47,090 --> 03:14:48,211
We'll pass the council tonight.

2358
03:14:49,912 --> 03:14:54,915
Oh, name and address of the record, please.

2359
03:14:55,136 --> 03:14:59,038
Ricky Cormier one 50 middle six have, I just want to congratulate my sister, Julianne Cormier.

2360
03:14:59,238 --> 03:15:03,181
She ran for camp Shriver and she finished the race in just over five hours.

2361
03:15:03,241 --> 03:15:04,021
So she did a great job.

2362
03:15:04,942 --> 03:15:05,723
Congratulations.

2363
03:15:05,763 --> 03:15:06,063
Thank you.

2364
03:15:07,665 --> 03:15:10,347
Records were passed to Councilor Knight.

2365
03:15:10,407 --> 03:15:12,628
Councilor Knight, how did you find those records?

2366
03:15:16,831 --> 03:15:22,835
Councilor Knight has asked the records be tabled for one week so he can perform an extensive review.

2367
03:15:24,036 --> 03:15:27,959
Motion by Councilor Scarpelli to adjourn, seconded by Councilor Falco.

2368
03:15:28,059 --> 03:15:28,739
All those in favor?

2369
03:15:30,700 --> 03:15:31,321
Meeting adjourned.
