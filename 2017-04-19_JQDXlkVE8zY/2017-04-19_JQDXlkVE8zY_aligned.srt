I pledge allegiance to the flag

19

one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

20
00:02:02,272 --> 00:02:04,934
Motion by Councillor Knight to take a paper out of order.

21
00:02:05,314 --> 00:02:06,894
Seconded by Councillor Scarpelli.

22
00:02:07,295 --> 00:02:08,055
All those in favour?

23
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:09,036
Aye.

24
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:10,056
Motion passes.

25
00:02:10,356 --> 00:02:10,996
Councillor Knight.

26
00:02:13,057 --> 00:02:18,300
Mr. President, I move to take paper 1771, the Wage Theft Prevention Ordinance, from the table.

27
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,581
It is eligible this evening for its third reading.

28
00:02:21,123 --> 00:02:24,925
This is a paper that has gone through the subcommittee process and through the committee of the whole process.

29
00:02:24,965 --> 00:02:33,489
And what it is, Mr. President, is it's a proposal to ensure that people that are bidding on public contracts here in the city of Medford comply with the wage and hour laws.

30
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:47,276
It requires that a series of certifications are made and a series of statements of credibility are made to the administration so that when they're awarding a contract, the individuals that are awarded the contract have not been found in violation of any wage and hour laws.

31
00:02:48,117 --> 00:02:50,398
Wage theft is a problem across the country, Mr. President.

32
00:02:50,762 --> 00:02:55,066
It's something that we see here in Massachusetts a lot of times with contracts like cleaning contracts.

33
00:02:55,767 --> 00:03:00,852
For example, the high school has a cleaning contract, and they may bring people in to clean the high school.

34
00:03:01,393 --> 00:03:04,616
And the prevailing wage rate, which they are supposed to be paid by law, is $26 an hour.

35
00:03:06,132 --> 00:03:10,694
But these employees are hourly workers that make $18 an hour when not working on the prevailing wage.

36
00:03:10,714 --> 00:03:12,995
And their employer will withhold those funds, Mr. President.

37
00:03:13,015 --> 00:03:15,796
So they're actually employers that are stealing money from their employees.

38
00:03:16,176 --> 00:03:26,000
So this ordinance requires that people that are bidding on public projects that are covered under the prevailing wage laws and other state and federal hour and wage laws, Mr. President, are in compliance.

39
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:29,582
They inform the city whether or not they've been found in violation.

40
00:03:29,622 --> 00:03:33,203
And they take out certain bonds if they have been found in violation.

41
00:03:33,818 --> 00:03:39,020
With us here this evening we have some individuals that were instrumental in putting this work, this ordinance together, Mr. President.

42
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,021
This is a paper that was originated through a group called Community Labor United.

43
00:03:43,961 --> 00:03:47,302
It's been a matter that's been endorsed and supported by the Greater Boston Labor Council.

44
00:03:47,722 --> 00:03:50,963
And here this evening with us from the Greater Boston Labor Council we have Rich Rogers.

45
00:03:51,779 --> 00:03:56,343
We also have representing Sean O'Brien from Local 25, James Donovan, political director.

46
00:03:57,264 --> 00:04:00,466
We have from Local 537, Bill Young here with us this evening.

47
00:04:01,167 --> 00:04:10,154
I'd be remiss not to mention Louie Mandarini from Local 22, a longtime Medford resident, Mr. President, who was instrumental in crafting this language and also helped with some technical assistance.

48
00:04:11,195 --> 00:04:13,477
And also with us, we have Phil Reason from the Painters Union here.

49
00:04:14,398 --> 00:04:19,542
Mr. President, this is a paper that Mayor Burke and I worked on in concert with the individuals that have been aforementioned.

50
00:04:19,966 --> 00:04:24,069
It's something that I wholeheartedly support, and I'd ask my colleagues this evening to vote in favor of it.

51
00:04:25,309 --> 00:04:26,350
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

52
00:04:27,751 --> 00:04:28,552
Councilor DelaRusso?

53
00:04:29,072 --> 00:04:29,392
Second.

54
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:35,796
On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

55
00:04:37,137 --> 00:04:38,698
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

56
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,361
Councilor DelaRusso?

57
00:04:43,521 --> 00:04:43,801
Yes.

58
00:04:45,082 --> 00:04:45,863
Councilor Falco?

59
00:04:45,923 --> 00:04:46,063
Yes.

60
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:47,063
Councilor Knight?

61
00:04:47,264 --> 00:04:47,484
Yes.

62
00:04:48,324 --> 00:04:49,005
Councilor McKernan?

63
00:04:49,025 --> 00:04:49,105
Yes.

64
00:04:49,859 --> 00:04:50,640
Vice President Marx.

65
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,280
Yes.

66
00:04:51,721 --> 00:04:52,541
Councilor Scott Kelly.

67
00:04:52,621 --> 00:04:52,902
Yes.

68
00:04:54,183 --> 00:04:54,883
President Caviello.

69
00:04:55,464 --> 00:04:55,704
Yes.

70
00:04:55,724 --> 00:04:59,227
17 in the affirmative, none in the negative.

71
00:05:00,428 --> 00:05:01,189
Motion passes.

72
00:05:01,229 --> 00:05:02,190
While we're under suspension.

73
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:02,190
17, 3, 7, 2.

74
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:02,190
17, 3, 7, 0.

75
00:05:03,591 --> 00:05:02,190
17, 3, 7, 2.

76
00:05:04,411 --> 00:05:02,190
17, 3, 7, 2.

77
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:27,614
petition for sign denial reversal by Jason Perillo, a back bay sign for Georgia's bakery, 25 Hall Street, Medford.

78
00:05:28,034 --> 00:05:31,755
OCD application 2017-3 exceeds allowable size 94-307-2.

79
00:05:31,855 --> 00:05:35,696
Vice President Marks is chairman of the sign committee.

80
00:05:45,446 --> 00:05:47,508
Yes, Mr. President, we have the petitioner in front of us.

81
00:05:47,528 --> 00:05:52,052
If you can just give us a brief synopsis on the sign itself.

82
00:05:53,273 --> 00:05:55,435
Good evening, Mr. President, members of the council.

83
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:57,617
I'm Jason Perillo with Back Bay sign company.

84
00:05:58,338 --> 00:06:08,387
Um, our petition to hear tonight is to ask petition to or ask for permission to install a wall sign for George's bakery products incorporated over at 25 hall street.

85
00:06:09,738 --> 00:06:15,022
The sign that we propose this evening is 35 square feet over what the ordinance allows.

86
00:06:15,102 --> 00:06:17,423
The building is 111 feet wide.

87
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:21,386
Um, the sign is designed to fit the architecture of the building.

88
00:06:22,106 --> 00:06:23,988
Um, the sign is not illuminated.

89
00:06:24,328 --> 00:06:26,609
There are no residences that can see the sign.

90
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,912
And, um, if you, uh, George is also here this evening.

91
00:06:29,952 --> 00:06:31,813
If you have any questions for the business owner.

92
00:06:31,973 --> 00:06:32,493
Thank you very much.

93
00:06:32,513 --> 00:06:33,654
Mr. President.

94
00:06:36,856 --> 00:06:37,737
Councilor Dela Rosa.

95
00:06:39,429 --> 00:06:44,773
I see no reason to object to this request for a variance.

96
00:06:46,294 --> 00:06:51,237
This gentleman brings business and good commerce to the city of Medford.

97
00:06:52,478 --> 00:07:00,103
It's a decent family business, and we wish them all the best, and I have no objection.

98
00:07:00,163 --> 00:07:01,524
Motion for approval, Mr. President.

99
00:07:01,544 --> 00:07:01,904
Thank you.

100
00:07:02,504 --> 00:07:03,065
Councilor Nice.

101
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:07,668
Mr. President, George's Bakery has been in this community for a very long time without incident,

102
00:07:08,362 --> 00:07:08,682
issue.

103
00:07:09,042 --> 00:07:10,843
Um, I get some bread from there every once in a while.

104
00:07:10,903 --> 00:07:11,483
I'm not going to lie.

105
00:07:12,023 --> 00:07:20,105
And, um, I certainly think that, uh, this proposal that's before us this evening is within reason and, um, meets the spirit and intent of the zoning ordinance, uh, relative to signage.

106
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:23,685
And I too move for approval with a second to council Della Russo's motion.

107
00:07:25,586 --> 00:07:25,766
Thank you.

108
00:07:25,786 --> 00:07:26,566
Vice-president Moxie.

109
00:07:26,906 --> 00:07:28,507
Do you motion for motion for approval?

110
00:07:29,027 --> 00:07:30,087
Thank you, Mr. President.

111
00:07:30,287 --> 00:07:34,948
Uh, based on the paperwork submitted, uh, and the, uh,

112
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,441
rendering of the sign itself and the location of the sign.

113
00:07:39,222 --> 00:07:52,767
I too see, uh, um, no concern with the size of the sign, even though it's nonconforming to existing, um, zoning sign ordinances.

114
00:07:53,668 --> 00:07:58,990
And, um, at this point, Mr. President, it's not internally illuminated.

115
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:02,932
Um, and at this point that would move approval, Mr. President.

116
00:08:03,948 --> 00:08:07,490
On the motion by vice president marks seconded by councilor night.

117
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:10,131
All those in favor.

118
00:08:11,232 --> 00:08:12,452
Oh, I have, I have, I'm sorry.

119
00:08:12,933 --> 00:08:16,474
Um, council marks is the sign a committee chairman.

120
00:08:17,075 --> 00:08:18,655
The motion comes from the sign chairman.

121
00:08:18,755 --> 00:08:19,276
That's correct.

122
00:08:20,776 --> 00:08:22,337
And seconded by councilor Donald Russo.

123
00:08:22,357 --> 00:08:23,198
All those in favor.

124
00:08:24,418 --> 00:08:25,179
Motion passes.

125
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,020
Thank you very much.

126
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,700
Thank you very much.

127
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,661
So George, good luck.

128
00:08:30,822 --> 00:08:33,543
Um, if we could also take, um,

129
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:45,055
17352, the nominees while they're here that were appointed last week that are coming here to be vetted this evening.

130
00:08:49,638 --> 00:08:51,038
Mr. Scott, would you second that motion?

131
00:08:51,058 --> 00:08:51,959
I second that motion.

132
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:52,279
Thank you.

133
00:08:53,820 --> 00:09:03,525
This evening, we have some people that were selected to be on the Community Preservation Committee, and under the rule of transparency,

134
00:09:04,129 --> 00:09:08,193
Uh, we feel, uh, we feel that it's a good to vet all these candidates.

135
00:09:08,213 --> 00:09:18,102
So, uh, at this point, while they're here, um, if you, when you, when we ask your name, if you could please come, uh, to the podium and give us a little brief resume.

136
00:09:18,743 --> 00:09:19,644
Uh, is Jones here?

137
00:09:19,924 --> 00:09:20,364
Jones here?

138
00:09:24,788 --> 00:09:25,789
Name and address of the record, please.

139
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:28,712
Jones here, 40 Cedar Road North, Medford.

140
00:09:30,098 --> 00:09:35,920
So I sent an application in to the mayor for a seat on the community preservation commission.

141
00:09:36,461 --> 00:09:45,905
As many of you know, I'm a resident of Medford, 17 years, was part of the preserve Medford campaign committee a couple of years ago to collect signatures to get the CPA on the ballot.

142
00:09:46,585 --> 00:09:49,186
And when it did pass, I was a member of the ad hoc committee.

143
00:09:49,883 --> 00:09:54,668
that was assembled to draft the ordinance and to usher it to completion to the City Council.

144
00:09:56,310 --> 00:10:08,282
In the application, it stated, you know, that an applicant should be a resident who has expertise or demonstrated interest in open space, recreation, historic preservation, and affordable housing, among other things.

145
00:10:08,863 --> 00:10:11,646
And that's what I sort of applied for because

146
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:15,810
Improving these things in the city of Medford is very important to me.

147
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:19,673
I know that these are the things that are usually on the bottom of the list when it comes to budget time.

148
00:10:19,713 --> 00:10:26,459
Of course, police, fire, safety, those kinds of things are much more important and usually get the dollars, and these ones don't.

149
00:10:26,499 --> 00:10:27,860
So this is one of the reasons why

150
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:35,094
I really felt that we could bring some good dollars to Medford, that we could improve the city and bring money into Medford by improving the city.

151
00:10:35,154 --> 00:10:45,179
So my certification as a project manager, one of the things that I do is I help the others that are in the room kind of use their expertise and bring it to fruition.

152
00:10:45,219 --> 00:10:51,362
So I'm the one who sort of helps people remove roadblocks, bring people together, open communication, that kind of thing.

153
00:10:51,382 --> 00:10:56,185
And that is the expertise that I could bring to this committee to kind of help the process move along and keep in time.

154
00:10:57,173 --> 00:11:04,679
That's why I applied, and I would appreciate your support, and I really do hope to help Medford become a more inviting city.

155
00:11:05,359 --> 00:11:05,799
Thank you, Joan.

156
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,661
Councilor Scott Pelley.

157
00:11:08,341 --> 00:11:10,563
I move to approve for Joan Cyr.

158
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:26,174
I know that Joan's done so many great things in our community, and her dedication and commitment and her leadership is going to drastically be needed with such a huge endeavor, so I move forward to accept Joan Cyr.

159
00:11:26,815 --> 00:11:27,755
as one of our members.

160
00:11:28,055 --> 00:11:28,376
Thank you.

161
00:11:28,936 --> 00:11:29,616
Councilor Falco.

162
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:30,516
Thank you, Mr. President.

163
00:11:30,536 --> 00:11:33,097
I just wanted to second Councilor Scott Peli.

164
00:11:33,237 --> 00:11:39,620
I worked with Joan on the CPC committee when we put together the resolution.

165
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,221
She was vital to the process.

166
00:11:42,761 --> 00:11:46,402
She's smart, she's committed, and I know she'll do a great job.

167
00:11:46,462 --> 00:11:51,864
This commission is going to be working very hard to, especially in its infancy.

168
00:11:51,924 --> 00:11:54,105
So I think I, you know, I definitely support

169
00:11:56,521 --> 00:11:59,482
being an appointee to this commission, and I just want to say good luck.

170
00:11:59,682 --> 00:11:59,962
Thank you.

171
00:12:00,242 --> 00:12:00,562
Thank you.

172
00:12:00,802 --> 00:12:02,063
Councillor Knight.

173
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:04,244
Yes, Mr. President, if you review Ms.

174
00:12:04,264 --> 00:12:11,527
Cyr's resume in contrast with the ordinance and the requirements that are set forth in the ordinance relative to what would make an appropriate appointee, you'll see that Ms.

175
00:12:11,547 --> 00:12:12,607
Cyr hits all the high spots.

176
00:12:13,247 --> 00:12:19,950
I, too, had the opportunity to work with her on the Community Preservation Commission subcommittee that helped draft the ordinance.

177
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,281
And I wanted to thank her for her technical expertise and her input and involvement.

178
00:12:23,301 --> 00:12:24,662
Mr. President, this is a great appointment.

179
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,163
It's someone that I'd wholeheartedly support.

180
00:12:26,563 --> 00:12:29,885
And I'd like to thank you for the opportunity for having us come up here this evening and vet this.

181
00:12:30,285 --> 00:12:31,085
I move approval as well.

182
00:12:31,105 --> 00:12:31,385
Thank you.

183
00:12:32,246 --> 00:12:33,066
Councilor Dela Rousseau.

184
00:12:33,506 --> 00:12:33,986
President.

185
00:12:34,006 --> 00:12:36,227
Uh, I was prepared to approve this last week.

186
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:37,668
I'm prepared again.

187
00:12:37,688 --> 00:12:40,970
Uh, tonight I had the delight of appointing her.

188
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:41,590
Thank you.

189
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:44,331
Community preservation, uh, preservation commission.

190
00:12:45,152 --> 00:12:45,732
Thank you.

191
00:12:45,812 --> 00:12:47,053
Um, thank you briefly.

192
00:12:47,073 --> 00:12:49,974
I just want to thank Joan and all the other members that are,

193
00:12:50,528 --> 00:12:53,809
have been appointed and coming to let us vet them tonight.

194
00:12:53,829 --> 00:12:59,391
I want to thank them for being here and thank them for wanting to be on such a committee that's going to take a lot of time and effort.

195
00:12:59,891 --> 00:13:03,972
Jonah's definitely going to do a great job, so I wish you the best of luck.

196
00:13:04,092 --> 00:13:15,736
I would ask that all the members, obviously, we'd love to be able to get the minutes of the meetings, whether it's email or hard copy of the minutes of the meetings, and to keep us informed so we know how the process is going.

197
00:13:15,996 --> 00:13:16,376
Thank you.

198
00:13:16,656 --> 00:13:16,996
Thank you.

199
00:13:17,617 --> 00:13:18,437
Vice President Mox.

200
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,681
Thank you, Mr. President.

201
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:29,447
And, uh, I'm happy that the council last week, uh, voted to invite all the, uh, appointments, uh, to this council.

202
00:13:30,127 --> 00:13:44,697
And, uh, I think we all realize that this is a good group of candidates and it was nice to hear Joe and that you appreciate the responsibilities of this particular appointment and also know that, uh, it does impact open space within our community.

203
00:13:45,227 --> 00:13:49,270
uh, historic preservation, housing, and a number of really important issues.

204
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:55,494
So, uh, I believe it's roughly a million dollars a year that'll be generated through, uh, the CPA.

205
00:13:56,015 --> 00:14:00,538
Uh, so it is an important task and I know you as one person will take this very seriously.

206
00:14:01,078 --> 00:14:05,742
And again, Mr. President, I, uh, agree with my colleagues and, uh, move approval.

207
00:14:05,902 --> 00:14:06,162
Thank you.

208
00:14:06,202 --> 00:14:10,965
Outstanding choice on the motion by councilor Della Russo, seconded by councilor Scott Pelly.

209
00:14:11,646 --> 00:14:14,668
All those in favor, motion passes.

210
00:14:15,428 --> 00:14:15,688
Joan.

211
00:14:15,828 --> 00:14:16,169
Thank you.

212
00:14:16,349 --> 00:14:16,689
Thank you.

213
00:14:16,709 --> 00:14:30,860
Um, Roberta Cameron said she, she's going to be a little late, so we'll get, we'll get her when she comes in.

214
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,061
Elizabeth Carey.

215
00:14:32,101 --> 00:14:32,822
Sue, are you here?

216
00:14:36,685 --> 00:14:37,085
Good evening.

217
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:38,166
Name and address of the record, please.

218
00:14:38,747 --> 00:14:40,348
My name's Elizabeth Curie soul.

219
00:14:40,568 --> 00:14:43,050
And my address is 50 Douglas road.

220
00:14:44,864 --> 00:14:47,465
So I'm a relatively new resident of Medford.

221
00:14:47,485 --> 00:14:56,808
I've been here for just under two years and I'm extremely excited about living here and really excited about the prospect that CPA funds could bring to Medford.

222
00:14:57,589 --> 00:14:58,729
I'm a landscape architect.

223
00:14:58,809 --> 00:15:02,230
I've been working as a landscape architect for about seven years.

224
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:06,152
I currently work for the Trustees of Reservations as a project manager.

225
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:10,133
I manage their capital projects along

226
00:15:11,027 --> 00:15:19,909
structures and landscapes or restorations of historic landscapes and new buildings on our properties and specifically on our historically significant properties.

227
00:15:20,329 --> 00:15:28,911
So I think I bring a lot of project management experience, a lot of appreciation for landscape and open spaces, appreciation for historic restoration.

228
00:15:29,771 --> 00:15:34,612
Um, and I'm extremely excited about the prospect of being involved in this committee.

229
00:15:34,632 --> 00:15:36,253
Thank you.

230
00:15:36,273 --> 00:15:36,773
Counselor Knight.

231
00:15:37,517 --> 00:15:39,617
Mr. President, once again, if you take a look at Ms.

232
00:15:39,637 --> 00:15:47,099
Sewell's resume and contrast that with the ordinance and the criteria that's put forth therein, you'll see that she meets all the major requirements that have been put forth.

233
00:15:47,719 --> 00:15:57,301
It appears to me, although I don't know the woman personally, that she's been a qualified and dedicated professional in her field of expertise, and she's someone that I will have no problem supporting this evening.

234
00:15:57,321 --> 00:15:57,961
I move for approval.

235
00:15:58,641 --> 00:15:58,981
Thank you.

236
00:16:00,621 --> 00:16:04,202
On the motion by Councilor Nye, seconded by Councilor Lungo-Kern, Councilor Mox,

237
00:16:05,101 --> 00:16:06,102
Thank you, Mr. President.

238
00:16:06,322 --> 00:16:07,603
It's nice to see Elizabeth.

239
00:16:07,723 --> 00:16:09,464
And I welcome you to the community.

240
00:16:09,505 --> 00:16:09,845
Thank you.

241
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:10,545
Two years.

242
00:16:10,565 --> 00:16:11,106
You're a rookie.

243
00:16:12,066 --> 00:16:13,648
So welcome to the community.

244
00:16:14,048 --> 00:16:16,650
Thank you for partaking on a very important committee.

245
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:23,955
And I was just wondering if you had any feedback relative to the lack of funding.

246
00:16:24,676 --> 00:16:29,539
Originally, this program started off with matching funds from the state.

247
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,621
And over the years, it has dwindled down.

248
00:16:32,415 --> 00:16:35,896
to I think it's at 18% now or maybe even less than that.

249
00:16:36,257 --> 00:16:38,517
Do you have any thoughts on that or?

250
00:16:39,878 --> 00:16:42,439
I mean, it's concerning that it's dwindling.

251
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:54,684
I hope that positive projects and positive success of the initiative will, you know, give reason for better matching in the future.

252
00:16:56,885 --> 00:17:00,666
So hopefully, the success of the initiative will continue its longevity.

253
00:17:01,191 --> 00:17:01,511
Thank you.

254
00:17:01,732 --> 00:17:02,633
I also move approval.

255
00:17:02,653 --> 00:17:03,213
Mr. President.

256
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:03,634
Thank you.

257
00:17:05,155 --> 00:17:08,879
On the motion by council at night, seconded by council of Kern.

258
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,181
All those in favor.

259
00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:10,922
Aye.

260
00:17:11,903 --> 00:17:12,664
Motion passes.

261
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:14,085
Congratulations.

262
00:17:14,145 --> 00:17:15,146
And thank you for your service.

263
00:17:15,186 --> 00:17:15,747
Thank you so much.

264
00:17:22,114 --> 00:17:22,474
Joseph.

265
00:17:28,815 --> 00:17:29,196
Good evening.

266
00:17:29,337 --> 00:17:30,380
Name and address of the record, please.

267
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,230
Joe Pecora, 25 Adams Street, Medford.

268
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:36,931
You want to give a little brief synopsis of yourself?

269
00:17:36,991 --> 00:17:37,231
Sure.

270
00:17:37,971 --> 00:17:40,532
I've been living in Medford for about five years now.

271
00:17:41,292 --> 00:17:46,114
And I work as a real estate agent out of Cambridge.

272
00:17:46,294 --> 00:17:48,895
I've been practicing as a real estate agent for about 15 years.

273
00:17:49,975 --> 00:17:51,535
I come from the trades.

274
00:17:52,376 --> 00:17:58,057
My family's involved with development in the suburbs, in the metro Boston region.

275
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:02,179
And I think I bring the experience both as

276
00:18:03,811 --> 00:18:07,133
as a real estate agent and as a contractor to the table.

277
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:10,055
And I look forward to working on the committee.

278
00:18:10,555 --> 00:18:10,875
Thank you.

279
00:18:11,096 --> 00:18:11,636
Councilor Knight.

280
00:18:12,557 --> 00:18:23,504
Mr. President, if you review Mr. Pecora's resume and contrast with the city ordinance, you'll see that he also hits all the high points in terms of criteria that's been established.

281
00:18:23,664 --> 00:18:29,227
As we all know, the Community Preservation Act does have a focus, number one, on land acquisition and number two, on affordable housing.

282
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:32,809
And I think he brings some much needed expertise in those fields and I move for approval.

283
00:18:34,223 --> 00:18:35,083
Vice President Mox.

284
00:18:36,004 --> 00:18:37,284
Thank you, Mr. President.

285
00:18:37,364 --> 00:18:45,387
And this may be a good opportunity for members of the committee to meet each other also, which is a great suggestion.

286
00:18:46,808 --> 00:18:57,332
Joe, knowing that you're in the field of real estate, what are your thoughts about what this community needs in regards to affordable housing?

287
00:18:57,352 --> 00:18:59,073
Do you think we're where we should be?

288
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:02,534
Do you think that there's a need for additional

289
00:19:03,843 --> 00:19:09,947
I don't know what the numbers are, what the stats reflect, but I know that's a concern as prices continue to soar.

290
00:19:11,088 --> 00:19:20,834
I know in other areas closer to, you know, Cambridge, Somerville and those markets, Somerville's been seeing real new price points, a million dollar condos left and right now.

291
00:19:22,269 --> 00:19:32,392
moving up as well in terms of price, and I think it's a pretty big concern for the community, pushing people out and not having a fairly decent mix of people from all walks of life.

292
00:19:33,052 --> 00:19:41,315
And I think it's important to consider and to work toward making sure that we create opportunities that are affordable for people.

293
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:47,397
I would imagine that Medford is feeling a pinch as well, rents as well as sales.

294
00:19:48,742 --> 00:19:57,768
I know just recently, the other day on North Street, there were a couple of condos that sold for a million dollars, almost a million in Medford.

295
00:19:57,808 --> 00:20:05,493
People are talking about price, rents are high, and yeah, I think it's a pretty significant question or point.

296
00:20:06,034 --> 00:20:07,094
You ought to look at it.

297
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:15,420
Mr. President, so far we've seen three candidates, and they all have their own expertise and style.

298
00:20:16,085 --> 00:20:28,311
And it's refreshing to hear Joe just mention the fact that with the housing market, as we know, in Cambridge, Somerville, and Method is experiencing right now, that there is a lack of affordability in this community.

299
00:20:28,952 --> 00:20:37,376
And I know with my children and other children in the community, that's a big concern that eventually someday they may not be able to afford to live in this community.

300
00:20:37,896 --> 00:20:43,399
And when you hear Joe mention that, that is something that's on his radar, and he's well aware of it.

301
00:20:43,999 --> 00:20:45,700
It makes me feel comfortable as one member

302
00:20:46,104 --> 00:20:56,209
Although a million dollars every year may not go far to adding a lot of additional affordable housing, but it's something that this committee will be responsible for.

303
00:20:56,289 --> 00:20:58,910
So I also, Mr. President, move approval.

304
00:20:59,130 --> 00:20:59,490
Thank you.

305
00:21:00,811 --> 00:21:04,973
On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Marks.

306
00:21:05,873 --> 00:21:06,593
All those in favor?

307
00:21:06,934 --> 00:21:07,034
Aye.

308
00:21:07,714 --> 00:21:08,414
Motion passes.

309
00:21:08,454 --> 00:21:11,796
Congratulations and thank you for your time and volunteers in our community.

310
00:21:17,522 --> 00:21:18,142
Heidi Davis.

311
00:21:21,624 --> 00:21:23,886
Nope.

312
00:21:26,867 --> 00:21:28,128
Just those four, we're not gonna do the other ones?

313
00:21:30,309 --> 00:21:38,894
Okay.

314
00:21:39,274 --> 00:21:44,217
And we're just waiting for Roberta to come, she'll be in later and we'll do her when she gets here.

315
00:21:46,651 --> 00:21:47,932
We'll table this until Roberta.

316
00:21:48,132 --> 00:21:49,832
Yeah, table the paper.

317
00:21:50,393 --> 00:21:56,254
On the motion to table by Council Member Kern, and seconded by Councilor Scott Pelley.

318
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,755
All those in favor?

319
00:21:59,395 --> 00:21:59,736
Okay.

320
00:22:02,316 --> 00:22:05,437
Councilor Knight has requested a brief recess.

321
00:22:06,098 --> 00:22:06,698
All those in favor?

322
00:25:04,167 --> 00:25:06,148
Motion to return back to regular business.

323
00:25:06,928 --> 00:25:22,497
While we're under suspension, 17370, offered by Councilor Longo-Kern, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council vote to support the establishment of a local historic district at 21 Toro Avenue.

324
00:25:23,197 --> 00:25:24,238
Councilor Longo-Kern.

325
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:27,119
Thank you, President Carviello.

326
00:25:27,639 --> 00:25:30,421
There was a number of meetings and a number of

327
00:25:31,132 --> 00:25:37,294
neighbors that were concerned about the property at 21 Toro Ave.

328
00:25:38,414 --> 00:25:52,818
It was purchased about a year ago and the neighborhood really worked with the Medford Historical Commission to create a local historic district for 21 Toro.

329
00:25:53,318 --> 00:26:00,200
It's something that the neighborhood is extremely excited about and it was quite refreshing having attended those meetings with

330
00:26:00,674 --> 00:26:09,141
a few of my colleagues, refreshing to have the owners of 21 Toro Ave be on board and almost excited about this endeavor.

331
00:26:09,261 --> 00:26:12,544
So it's something that's long overdue for the council approval.

332
00:26:13,025 --> 00:26:24,194
And I would like to vote on that tonight that we make 21 Toro Ave a local historic district to preserve the history of the property and into the future.

333
00:26:24,214 --> 00:26:24,955
Um, this will,

334
00:26:25,511 --> 00:26:33,074
be recorded at the Registry of Deeds, and it's something that is long overdue to be voted by the council, and hopefully we can all support this and move forward.

335
00:26:33,114 --> 00:26:41,497
And I believe we're the last step in getting this push forward, so I think it's something that we need to act on sooner than later.

336
00:26:42,077 --> 00:26:43,117
Thank you, Councilor Locren.

337
00:26:43,958 --> 00:26:44,758
Councilor Scarpelli.

338
00:26:45,398 --> 00:26:46,278
Thank you, Mr. President.

339
00:26:46,298 --> 00:26:49,640
Thank you, Councilor Locren, for bringing this up.

340
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:53,261
I, too, went to those meetings, and I think it's so important

341
00:26:53,675 --> 00:26:58,063
I think we also visited that whole neighborhood and visiting and looking into that.

342
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:04,315
I believe that we also voted during budget time to approve some funding to increase.

343
00:27:04,335 --> 00:27:05,678
That would be something that

344
00:27:06,098 --> 00:27:09,781
if we can to maybe help us where we are with those monies.

345
00:27:09,801 --> 00:27:11,362
Have they been expended?

346
00:27:11,582 --> 00:27:23,471
Are we putting, I believe that we were putting the, the, um, the, not the monuments, but there was the, uh, uh, the plaques at historical locations.

347
00:27:24,208 --> 00:27:24,968
I know that we were looking to.

348
00:27:24,988 --> 00:27:28,270
Typically, we have not provided plaques, but we can certainly do.

349
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:28,830
Excuse me.

350
00:27:29,791 --> 00:27:30,191
Oh, sorry.

351
00:27:30,211 --> 00:27:31,812
Let me introduce myself.

352
00:27:32,112 --> 00:27:32,952
My name is Chris Bader.

353
00:27:32,972 --> 00:27:35,454
Name and address of the record, please.

354
00:27:35,474 --> 00:27:35,974
298 High Street.

355
00:27:37,935 --> 00:27:44,578
I'm the chair of the Historic District Commission, and we're in charge of creating new historic districts.

356
00:27:44,918 --> 00:27:45,238
Sorry, Chris.

357
00:27:45,258 --> 00:27:51,962
And as you say, we should absolutely put a plaque indicating this is the King House

358
00:27:52,687 --> 00:27:56,448
with its construction date, approximate construction date of the 1840s.

359
00:27:57,068 --> 00:28:04,911
It's part of the historic, it's an important historic building in South Medford.

360
00:28:05,751 --> 00:28:15,495
And let me just give you a brief summary of the events that led to this becoming

361
00:28:17,747 --> 00:28:22,709
a candidate for her local historic district, which is that it was owned by Tufts University.

362
00:28:23,309 --> 00:28:40,076
And they kind of pulled a fast one on the grandfather's house, where they subdivided it with no public input, and then sold the entire property to a contractor who immediately sold off grandfather's house itself and built a

363
00:28:43,869 --> 00:28:47,412
prefab house on the remaining property.

364
00:28:47,712 --> 00:28:49,614
And everyone was upset about that.

365
00:28:50,055 --> 00:28:54,599
Then they wanted to do exactly the same thing on 21 Turo.

366
00:28:54,639 --> 00:29:01,425
They had no intention of destroying the historic house, but they had their eye on that very juicy piece of property.

367
00:29:01,745 --> 00:29:03,086
The neighbors were outraged.

368
00:29:03,987 --> 00:29:10,212
It was really a grassroots uprising, you might even say.

369
00:29:11,744 --> 00:29:23,987
And finally, the Tufts and the new perspective owner backed down and agreed to sell it to someone who agreed not to subdivide the property.

370
00:29:25,027 --> 00:29:32,449
I think historic districts, part of our job is not just to preserve historic buildings, but to preserve open space.

371
00:29:33,309 --> 00:29:35,750
And a lot of these historic houses are on big lots.

372
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:39,030
And the neighbors want to keep it that way.

373
00:29:42,377 --> 00:29:49,839
It was tentatively resolved with the new owners that they would put a historic preservation restriction on the deed.

374
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:58,222
Now, the problem is this is a historic preservation deed of preservation restriction of limited duration.

375
00:29:59,502 --> 00:30:05,384
And moreover, the building department does not have easy access to preservation restrictions.

376
00:30:05,724 --> 00:30:07,685
It's there at the registry of deeds.

377
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:14,794
But it's not something there that a building inspector is going to be able to look at in a few minutes.

378
00:30:16,195 --> 00:30:25,640
So we decided we would, in addition to the historic preservation restriction, we would seek local historical status.

379
00:30:26,321 --> 00:30:32,985
We sent out, there's an elaborate process spelled out by the Mass Historical Commission, which we followed.

380
00:30:33,025 --> 00:30:35,106
It took about a year to actually get it through.

381
00:30:36,667 --> 00:30:37,708
We held a public hearing.

382
00:30:39,182 --> 00:30:42,764
We were actually amazed to find that no one opposed it, including the owners.

383
00:30:44,164 --> 00:30:45,525
In fact, they really were delighted.

384
00:30:47,105 --> 00:30:53,728
We held this public hearing after a 60-day waiting period and blah, blah, blah.

385
00:30:54,169 --> 00:30:58,490
And really, the last step is now for you guys to vote on it.

386
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:08,455
It requires per Massachusetts General Laws 40C, it requires a two-thirds vote of the

387
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,421
of the city council.

388
00:31:11,441 --> 00:31:12,582
That means five of you guys.

389
00:31:13,642 --> 00:31:15,444
Um, and we would appreciate your support.

390
00:31:17,405 --> 00:31:17,745
Thank you.

391
00:31:19,146 --> 00:31:24,569
Any questions?

392
00:31:24,829 --> 00:31:30,973
Tell me what this, uh, in creation, this, uh, historic district at 21 Toro F yes.

393
00:31:32,034 --> 00:31:38,158
Uh, defined 21 Toro F it is the current, it is the house and the current property.

394
00:31:39,373 --> 00:31:44,316
uh, that is in, that is registered at the registry of deeds as 21 Turo.

395
00:31:44,916 --> 00:31:53,921
So it is both, uh, this is not something that can be subdivided or built on without the permission of the historic district commission.

396
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:54,961
Thank you.

397
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:56,782
Chris, can you give me that one?

398
00:31:56,802 --> 00:32:01,665
The, the law again, excuse me, the law again, 40 C what do you say?

399
00:32:01,905 --> 00:32:06,667
General master was 40 C yes.

400
00:32:06,707 --> 00:32:08,048
Point of information, Mr. President.

401
00:32:10,385 --> 00:32:12,366
Councilor Del Rosso, point of information.

402
00:32:12,486 --> 00:32:15,687
Have we received any communique on this from the city solicitor?

403
00:32:16,388 --> 00:32:17,088
Uh, we have not.

404
00:32:17,428 --> 00:32:22,870
The city solicitor has, um, has the habit of speaking for himself.

405
00:32:23,391 --> 00:32:23,891
Yes.

406
00:32:24,991 --> 00:32:33,755
Uh, he, um, he was, he basically, there was very basic language, uh, added to the, uh, existing bylaws of the city of Medford.

407
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:41,712
in accordance with Master Noland's 40C, and the city solicitor approved that language.

408
00:32:42,952 --> 00:32:53,315
Basically, there's nothing in there besides adding the King House to the list of the other two historic districts in Medford.

409
00:32:54,616 --> 00:32:57,657
Otherwise, no changes whatsoever to the Medford bylaws.

410
00:33:00,217 --> 00:33:00,757
Councilor Knight.

411
00:33:01,998 --> 00:33:02,658
Mr. Bader, how are you?

412
00:33:03,373 --> 00:33:03,753
Good to see you.

413
00:33:03,873 --> 00:33:04,434
Good to see you.

414
00:33:04,654 --> 00:33:08,796
Um, all the procedural requirements have been met by the district commission.

415
00:33:08,816 --> 00:33:11,037
So now right now, okay.

416
00:33:11,097 --> 00:33:20,202
And right now, um, this would bring this, if we take this to a vote this evening, it would bring this issue of 21 to wrap the finality and it would have its single home historic district classification.

417
00:33:20,642 --> 00:33:22,503
Yes.

418
00:33:22,523 --> 00:33:23,444
Mr. President, I move for approval.

419
00:33:24,064 --> 00:33:24,384
Thank you.

420
00:33:25,365 --> 00:33:26,165
Vice president mocks.

421
00:33:27,106 --> 00:33:27,866
Thank you, Mr. President.

422
00:33:28,789 --> 00:33:33,213
Do we do we have any other properties in the city that are in a similar circumstance?

423
00:33:34,294 --> 00:33:46,203
That are in immediate danger of subdivision As the reason for the developer buying them not that I'm aware of no There are of course historic houses all over Medford.

424
00:33:46,243 --> 00:33:56,632
They need protection and we're working on a plan to a general plan to protect these houses particularly those

425
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:01,360
in close to Medford Square.

426
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:09,081
For example, the Andrew House, the David Osgood House, which is owned by the Unitarian Church but is in very poor condition.

427
00:34:11,782 --> 00:34:15,743
And we don't think Grandfather's House is in any danger at this point.

428
00:34:15,763 --> 00:34:23,604
The damage has already been done with the construction of the prefab house that was built next to it.

429
00:34:25,445 --> 00:34:26,265
So we're focusing

430
00:34:27,268 --> 00:34:31,131
at the moment in houses near, uh, uh, uh, square.

431
00:34:32,912 --> 00:34:37,876
And if the council were to vote on this tonight, do you know when it would become effective?

432
00:34:38,116 --> 00:34:42,319
Is it something that, uh, you would have to talk to the city solicitor about that.

433
00:34:42,479 --> 00:34:45,261
But, but I would believe it would be effective immediately.

434
00:34:45,441 --> 00:34:46,282
Effective immediately.

435
00:34:46,322 --> 00:34:46,462
Yes.

436
00:34:46,942 --> 00:34:47,163
Okay.

437
00:34:48,183 --> 00:34:49,204
I too would move approval.

438
00:34:49,244 --> 00:34:49,804
Mr. President.

439
00:34:51,966 --> 00:34:52,606
Councilor Falco.

440
00:34:52,767 --> 00:34:53,507
Thank you, Mr. President.

441
00:34:53,527 --> 00:34:54,668
I just wanted to, uh,

442
00:34:55,139 --> 00:34:58,102
say thank you for your hard work on this, and thank everyone here tonight.

443
00:34:58,622 --> 00:34:59,603
I think this is important.

444
00:35:00,343 --> 00:35:01,885
It's something I support wholeheartedly.

445
00:35:02,885 --> 00:35:05,047
We need to protect our historic homes.

446
00:35:05,488 --> 00:35:07,790
And I think this goes a long way in doing that.

447
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:09,991
Hopefully, we could probably see more of it, too.

448
00:35:10,111 --> 00:35:18,218
But I think with developers coming in all the time trying to tear things down, I think they're tearing apart our history.

449
00:35:18,298 --> 00:35:19,199
And that's unfortunate.

450
00:35:19,299 --> 00:35:20,140
And we need to do more.

451
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:22,842
And I just want to thank you for all your efforts.

452
00:35:23,022 --> 00:35:23,823
Thank you so much.

453
00:35:24,383 --> 00:35:25,023
and move approval.

454
00:35:25,244 --> 00:35:25,544
Thank you.

455
00:35:30,147 --> 00:35:40,574
On the motion by Councilor Lungo, on the motion by Councilor Lungo-Kernan, seconded by, by Councilor Falco, and this requires a two-third vote.

456
00:35:41,075 --> 00:35:42,856
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

457
00:35:50,441 --> 00:35:51,302
Councilor Dela Ruccio.

458
00:35:51,362 --> 00:35:51,442
Yes.

459
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:53,911
Councilor Falco.

460
00:35:54,071 --> 00:35:54,311
Yes.

461
00:35:55,011 --> 00:35:55,512
Councilor Knight.

462
00:35:55,772 --> 00:35:56,012
Yes.

463
00:35:56,592 --> 00:35:57,313
Councilor Kern.

464
00:35:57,493 --> 00:35:57,613
Yes.

465
00:35:58,514 --> 00:35:59,294
Vice President Mox.

466
00:35:59,635 --> 00:35:59,875
Yes.

467
00:36:00,395 --> 00:36:01,156
Councilor Scarpelli.

468
00:36:01,256 --> 00:36:01,496
Yes.

469
00:36:03,017 --> 00:36:03,738
President Caviello.

470
00:36:04,278 --> 00:36:04,558
Yes.

471
00:36:05,939 --> 00:36:08,301
Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

472
00:36:08,761 --> 00:36:09,542
Motion passes.

473
00:36:09,702 --> 00:36:10,483
Congratulations.

474
00:36:10,503 --> 00:36:10,883
Thank you.

475
00:36:19,229 --> 00:36:20,350
While we're on the suspension, 17-371,

476
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:40,171
offered by Councilor Lungo-Kern being resolved that the Medford City Council move forward with extending the demolition delay of historic properties from six months to 18 months to 24 months by changing Chapter 48 of the City of Medford ordinances.

477
00:36:40,351 --> 00:36:41,532
Councilor Lungo-Kern.

478
00:36:43,013 --> 00:36:46,115
Thank you, President Carviello.

479
00:36:46,335 --> 00:36:51,299
Um, I know that the demo delay Chapter 48 isn't,

480
00:36:53,217 --> 00:37:02,406
subcommittee, so I'm not sure what councils have been able to read it, but I believe the commission and myself or whoever will be able to get a copy to anybody that hasn't.

481
00:37:03,127 --> 00:37:12,315
Um, this proposal was voted in favor by the Medford historical commission and it is outlined in yellow.

482
00:37:12,335 --> 00:37:17,921
Um, the version I have outlined in yellow with the potential changes.

483
00:37:18,645 --> 00:37:27,071
And obviously, one of the biggest changes is we currently have a six-month demo delay that has been around for quite some time.

484
00:37:27,811 --> 00:37:38,719
But times are changing, and a number of different communities are moving towards extending their demo delay or already have a 12-, 18-, or 24-month demo delay.

485
00:37:38,739 --> 00:37:45,763
I know that I believe Winchester's working on pushing it to a year.

486
00:37:45,864 --> 00:37:48,005
Watertown has 24 months, Somerville

487
00:37:48,523 --> 00:37:50,564
has an extended demo delay.

488
00:37:50,644 --> 00:37:53,285
Lexington, Concord, they're at Woburn.

489
00:37:54,046 --> 00:37:58,628
There are a number of cities and towns around us that do have a demo delay.

490
00:38:01,089 --> 00:38:16,216
The commission in their annual report, Medford Historical Commission in their annual report, it shows 2016, the amount of demo delays is up, I don't know, would you say 90%?

491
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:24,373
The norm was about one to two requests for a demolition of a historical property.

492
00:38:24,833 --> 00:38:31,376
This current ordinance we have is anything 1900 or above, built in 1900 or above.

493
00:38:31,957 --> 00:38:48,245
In 2016, not only were there 17 applications for demo delays, but the historic commission found that 17 properties were historically significant and preferably preserved.

494
00:38:48,804 --> 00:38:50,705
So I think that's an important factor.

495
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:53,366
It goes to show that times really are changing.

496
00:38:53,786 --> 00:38:57,588
We've had uproar in the city over a number of different parcels.

497
00:38:59,048 --> 00:39:07,432
Walnut Street brings to mind what's been, as of recent, you have 18 Walnut Street, you have the property across the street.

498
00:39:08,112 --> 00:39:17,156
You also have a property that was listed, and I'm not gonna name the address, but it listed, and I believe it was listed on MLS, because I do have access to MLS,

499
00:39:18,008 --> 00:39:18,548
I did read it.

500
00:39:18,628 --> 00:39:25,890
I don't have it in front of me, but it was advertised as a single-family home that could be turned into four units.

501
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:28,710
So that's a problem to the community.

502
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:30,231
It's a problem to our neighborhoods.

503
00:39:31,111 --> 00:39:34,691
The residents in the community are not happy with the current state.

504
00:39:35,352 --> 00:39:40,473
And the six-month delay is not deterring what it used to deter.

505
00:39:42,053 --> 00:39:46,374
You can go over the Walnut Street property and what's going on there, and that gives you significant proof

506
00:39:47,121 --> 00:39:48,241
you know, what I just stated.

507
00:39:49,662 --> 00:39:51,442
So why is the delay?

508
00:39:51,502 --> 00:39:55,683
And this is put, this is question and answers that have been put out by the historical commission.

509
00:39:56,143 --> 00:40:01,664
Why is the delay being changed from six months to 24 months or potentially why are we requesting that?

510
00:40:01,704 --> 00:40:03,585
Why am I asking the council to support this?

511
00:40:04,465 --> 00:40:08,666
Primarily because the commission has found that the present six month delay is not effective.

512
00:40:09,306 --> 00:40:15,027
The commission has seen numerous cases where owners or developers have showed no interest in working with either the commission

513
00:40:15,635 --> 00:40:24,241
or the neighborhood to look at alternatives to demolition and simply waited out the six-month demo delay time frame and demolished the property anyway.

514
00:40:25,241 --> 00:40:32,226
A larger potential demo delay time frame of up to 24 months is generally too long a time frame for a project to become dormant.

515
00:40:33,127 --> 00:40:39,391
And the commission feels that the extra time will give the demo delay some teeth and leverage that will serve Medford and our neighborhoods better.

516
00:40:41,684 --> 00:40:44,026
and why the changes are being proposed.

517
00:40:44,106 --> 00:40:52,933
And I just stated already over the last five minutes, there are several significant historic buildings that have been demoed.

518
00:40:53,793 --> 00:40:54,914
Residents have been upset.

519
00:40:55,315 --> 00:40:59,198
And as the real estate market continues to improve, no more vacant land exists.

520
00:40:59,318 --> 00:41:02,460
The threat of Medford's historic buildings is ever increasing.

521
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:11,427
The proposed bylaws tries to address these concerns by providing time to research alternatives to demo before any more historic buildings are lost.

522
00:41:11,853 --> 00:41:20,200
It also clarifies previously undefined terms and creates a standard set of mandates for applicants to complete in order for the commission to lift the delay.

523
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:24,243
I know we have a number of residents and we have Ryan Haywood.

524
00:41:24,323 --> 00:41:32,710
I reached out to him last week after I got emails and phone calls from concerned residents on the Walnut Street property.

525
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:36,894
And you see Facebook, there's a number of people that are interested in this.

526
00:41:37,074 --> 00:41:40,657
And I believe the time is now, whether we have a committee of the whole meeting,

527
00:41:41,182 --> 00:41:47,865
or we decide to move forward with this tonight, I think it's something that we need to move on quickly.

528
00:41:48,585 --> 00:42:08,793
Ryan was gracious enough to meet with me, and I know he'll meet with, or has met with other councilors as well, to explain in depth what the ordinance entails, the proposed changes to it, how they will affect in more detail than I can give the community, and I think it's a win-win, and I think it's something that we need to discuss and move forward with.

529
00:42:10,325 --> 00:42:14,246
leave it to the people, the residents who are thankfully came tonight to support the paper.

530
00:42:15,486 --> 00:42:16,286
Thank you, Mr. President.

531
00:42:16,306 --> 00:42:19,427
Again, I thank a counselor longer current for bringing this forward.

532
00:42:20,027 --> 00:42:24,668
Uh, this is, this issue is, is greater than what it reads itself.

533
00:42:24,728 --> 00:42:32,450
I think that what we're seeing in our community with our questions and zoning and a lack of true development plan, I think is it,

534
00:42:33,518 --> 00:42:42,924
This one key issue really sums up what we're seeing as probably the number one now major issue and concern in our community.

535
00:42:44,425 --> 00:42:54,131
I too was part of the subcommittee that saw this as an issue and moved it forward for 12 months with a possible another six months.

536
00:42:54,671 --> 00:42:58,073
So looking at that 18 months, that's something we wholeheartedly supported.

537
00:42:58,554 --> 00:43:09,076
and subcommittee, I think that it is still was brought back and then put to the city solicitor for final approval.

538
00:43:09,116 --> 00:43:23,559
I think that bringing this forward kind of gives you that kickstart that we need to get a final answer and whether it's in committee of the whole or in the open meetings to get this

539
00:43:24,035 --> 00:43:24,636
get this through.

540
00:43:24,676 --> 00:43:37,112
I think it's very important because what we are seeing is free reign throughout our community and making sure right now, looking at a historical community and tying that

541
00:43:37,697 --> 00:43:42,278
and holding that off where we have that control right now, I think is vital.

542
00:43:42,338 --> 00:43:46,159
So I appreciate my fellow council for bringing this up.

543
00:43:46,179 --> 00:43:54,520
I appreciate all the hard work and the emails that I did receive from multiple community members and concerns that were brought forth.

544
00:43:54,640 --> 00:44:00,861
I know that one member came behind this reel last week and we had a depth conversation because you can hear it in their voices.

545
00:44:01,401 --> 00:44:05,222
And when people seeing communities that

546
00:44:05,801 --> 00:44:10,964
that we know as of Medford changing right in front of your eyes and it looks like we have no control.

547
00:44:11,024 --> 00:44:24,010
So I think this is a great resolution to at least put a stop to this right now and give us a little bit more control as we look into the zoning and development concerns that we do have for our community.

548
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:28,713
So I wholeheartedly second this, this motion and moving this forward.

549
00:44:28,753 --> 00:44:30,073
So thank you.

550
00:44:30,934 --> 00:44:31,474
Counselor Knight.

551
00:44:32,094 --> 00:44:33,395
Mr. President, thank you very much.

552
00:44:33,755 --> 00:44:34,956
Um, by way of history,

553
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:39,862
I'd like to just give a, give a brief breakdown as to, um, the process in June of 2016.

554
00:44:40,142 --> 00:44:48,165
Um, the historical commission came before the council during budget hearings and express some concern about the demolition delay.

555
00:44:48,825 --> 00:44:56,388
Um, at that point in time, in June of 2016, uh, I was working on a proposal with Mr. Haywood based upon some recommendations that he had in council.

556
00:44:56,428 --> 00:45:01,530
Longo current put forward a resolution requesting that, um, the demolition delay be looked at in June of 2016.

557
00:45:01,570 --> 00:45:04,851
That paper was referred to the zoning and ordinance committee.

558
00:45:05,235 --> 00:45:09,197
and it was introduced by way of a subcommittee hearing language.

559
00:45:09,238 --> 00:45:23,146
Language was put together and in August of 2016, the Zoning and Ordinance Subcommittee reported the following changes to 48-78B out of committee favorably for full review and vetting from the committee of the whole.

560
00:45:24,227 --> 00:45:31,131
The first recommendation that the subcommittee made was to strike the figure 1900 and replace that with homes built within the last 75 years.

561
00:45:31,291 --> 00:45:34,153
Presently, homes subject to demolition delay

562
00:45:34,954 --> 00:45:42,379
have to have been built before the year 1900 and the recommendation of the subcommittee was to strike that and replace it with homes built within the last 75 years.

563
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:56,748
Um, also the subcommittee, uh, agreed in their committee report, which was reported out favorably, um, underneath four eight dash seven eight B subsection H to strike the figure six months and replace it with the figure 12 months.

564
00:45:57,769 --> 00:46:00,911
And, uh, that would be the amount of time for which the demolition delay can take place.

565
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:11,643
Um, also under section I two, um, would be strike six months and replaced with 12 months again, a housekeeping to ensure that, uh, the ordinance would reflect that demolition delay would be 12 months.

566
00:46:12,523 --> 00:46:24,887
Um, the subcommittee also recommended that a new section be added to four, eight dash seven, eight, um, which would allow for the historical commission to petition the city council for an additional six months of demolition delay.

567
00:46:25,408 --> 00:46:29,389
Um, if they felt certain requirements and criterias weren't met, this was,

568
00:46:31,512 --> 00:46:36,696
reported out of the committee in August of 2016 and set for a committee of the whole hearing.

569
00:46:37,977 --> 00:47:00,314
The matter was being scheduled for a committee of the whole hearing when the commission asked to hold off and presented us with a revamped ordinance that they wrote that was a little bit more than just increasing the number of years that it takes to make a house eligible for demolition delay and also increasing the amount of time for which they have to delay

570
00:47:01,136 --> 00:47:02,117
demolition of a house.

571
00:47:03,318 --> 00:47:07,700
So in October of 2016, the Historical Commission presented those changes to the subcommittee.

572
00:47:08,521 --> 00:47:16,146
And in October of 2016, the subcommittee requested some technical assistance relative to some questions that were raised relative to legalities.

573
00:47:16,906 --> 00:47:20,088
Those were sent to the Office of Community Development and the legal department.

574
00:47:21,329 --> 00:47:22,910
Those questions weren't answered.

575
00:47:22,970 --> 00:47:27,313
And in January 2017, there were some subcommittee changes with the change of the leadership to the president.

576
00:47:28,161 --> 00:47:50,307
So councilor Dela Rousseau for councilor Falco and councillor Me night now make up the committee in February of 2017 a meeting notice was posted to reconvene and discuss this matter where we had not received any response from the administration at which time the snowstorm struck and The meeting was canceled because City Hall was closed so that brings us to February 2017 mr. President so it appears that as of

577
00:47:55,495 --> 00:48:03,941
In August 2016, the subcommittee had reported out a paper favorably to the Committee of the Whole, and there is a paper that is now at the Committee of the Whole that would address this issue.

578
00:48:04,741 --> 00:48:12,026
The recommendations were to increase the number of years for which a home would be eligible for a demolition delay to be built within the last 75 years.

579
00:48:12,046 --> 00:48:20,692
It would also give a 12-month automatic demolition delay with the ability for the commission to petition this council for an opportunity for an additional six months, Mr. President.

580
00:48:23,502 --> 00:48:26,204
recommendations still remain on the table and can be brought up at any time.

581
00:48:26,244 --> 00:48:27,564
We can move forward on those tomorrow.

582
00:48:28,085 --> 00:48:39,591
Um, the proposed ordinance that the commission put together, um, was a little bit more inclusive than just addressing issues of time and of delay.

583
00:48:40,152 --> 00:48:42,753
Um, and there was a number of concerns that were raised by the subcommittee.

584
00:48:42,773 --> 00:48:48,897
The subcommittee, um, was waiting to get some answers back from the administration's legal team and community development team that hasn't happened.

585
00:48:48,937 --> 00:48:51,378
And we share the frustration that the individuals behind the rail share,

586
00:48:52,014 --> 00:49:03,660
However, if the matter is just as simple as increasing the number of years to look at a house and the amount of time to delay demolition, there's a paper that's sitting right at our Committee of the Whole right now that we can act on, Mr. President, and that will address that issue.

587
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:06,421
And then we can go and continue to properly vet the proposals.

588
00:49:06,721 --> 00:49:08,342
And that's the course of action that I would recommend.

589
00:49:08,842 --> 00:49:09,182
Thank you.

590
00:49:10,443 --> 00:49:11,183
Vice President Marks.

591
00:49:12,464 --> 00:49:13,464
Thank you, Mr. President.

592
00:49:13,764 --> 00:49:18,907
And, you know, this is such an important ordinance.

593
00:49:19,848 --> 00:49:29,834
And in my opinion, waiting for a legal opinion, waiting for the administration to move on something is long overdue.

594
00:49:30,875 --> 00:49:38,940
And I'd rather see something put forward and have us worry about maybe some ramifications down the line.

595
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:43,463
I'd rather see some protections in place right now, Mr. President.

596
00:49:44,123 --> 00:49:46,485
And what makes this community so unique

597
00:49:47,377 --> 00:49:57,363
is the, and you hear it over and over again, is the very uniqueness of every neighborhood, Mr. President, and every style of home in this community.

598
00:49:57,923 --> 00:50:10,170
And slowly but surely, we're losing the style of this community to these large salt box type homes and condominium projects, Mr. President.

599
00:50:10,583 --> 00:50:17,667
all for the sake of adding additional units and additional money for the developers.

600
00:50:18,507 --> 00:50:28,252
And you know, as was mentioned earlier, many of these older homes are on larger properties like on Walnut that have additional space.

601
00:50:28,832 --> 00:50:33,214
And the developers see this nothing more than a way of making additional money.

602
00:50:33,935 --> 00:50:36,256
And we as a community have to safeguard ourselves

603
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:39,101
And I think this is a great step in the right direction.

604
00:50:39,121 --> 00:50:47,325
I'd rather see the 75 years extended to 100 years and beyond, to be quite honest with you.

605
00:50:48,426 --> 00:50:52,968
And the 12-month, in my opinion, is not long enough.

606
00:50:53,908 --> 00:51:03,733
I think what was offered as 18-month for a demolition delay, or even 24-month, at least provides this community with ample opportunity

607
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:06,541
to safeguard its historic homes.

608
00:51:07,041 --> 00:51:10,942
So I personally would like to see us take a vote tonight.

609
00:51:10,982 --> 00:51:13,603
I think that's what Councilor Lungo-Kern has requested.

610
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:17,665
The resolve says from six months to 18 or 24.

611
00:51:18,165 --> 00:51:23,086
I think we have to narrow it down naturally before we vote on it, because you can't have 18 or 24.

612
00:51:23,546 --> 00:51:24,607
It has to be one or the other.

613
00:51:25,527 --> 00:51:34,010
But I definitely think, and I'm prepared tonight to move this forward, Mr. President, because I've been around a while.

614
00:51:34,692 --> 00:51:41,737
And I'm not going to wait to hear with an opinion that may be rendered down the line that we've been waiting on already for six months.

615
00:51:42,578 --> 00:51:45,901
Um, because, uh, I, I rather move forward, Mr. President.

616
00:51:46,361 --> 00:51:50,504
Uh, this is long overdue and I would support, uh, the resolution tonight, Mr. President.

617
00:51:54,207 --> 00:51:54,527
Thank you.

618
00:51:54,587 --> 00:52:03,194
I want to get to, um, allow the speakers to speak, but I, I too would be agreeable to even if we vote for a demo delay,

619
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:09,902
tonight, whether it be the 12 months that the committee discussed with an extension of six months or an 18 month demo delay.

620
00:52:09,922 --> 00:52:12,283
I think we should move forward on a vote like that tonight.

621
00:52:13,583 --> 00:52:16,064
And then we do have a number of other changes.

622
00:52:16,104 --> 00:52:22,507
Maybe we can meet in committee of the whole to discuss changing the ordinance completely, but I think we need to move forward on something.

623
00:52:22,527 --> 00:52:24,287
I think the votes may be here to do that.

624
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:28,449
So I'd like to hear from the speakers and I'm agreeable to my colleagues.

625
00:52:29,569 --> 00:52:30,330
Councilor DelaRusso.

626
00:52:30,350 --> 00:52:31,090
Mr. President.

627
00:52:32,165 --> 00:52:36,368
If I could, through the chair, ask Councilor Knight again to restate his recommendation.

628
00:52:37,429 --> 00:52:47,076
I believe that he was suggesting that we had something in Committee of the Whole, and we have two contrasting things, so I just want some clarity, if I could.

629
00:52:47,557 --> 00:52:48,017
Councilor Knight.

630
00:52:49,058 --> 00:52:56,063
The recommendation of the subcommittee coming out of the August subcommittee report, which was favorable and unanimous,

631
00:52:56,638 --> 00:52:58,558
would be to strike the figure 1900.

632
00:52:58,698 --> 00:53:02,319
Right now it said any home built before 1900 was subject to a demolition delay.

633
00:53:02,719 --> 00:53:05,980
We wanted to reduce that figure to any home built within the last 75 years.

634
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:08,920
That was the recommendation of the committee that was reported out favorably.

635
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:13,941
That's subsection B under ordinance 48-78.

636
00:53:14,901 --> 00:53:19,862
We also have the opportunity to strike the figure six months and replace it with 12 months.

637
00:53:20,122 --> 00:53:23,663
And that was a reference to the amount of time for which the demolition delay would be in effect.

638
00:53:24,208 --> 00:53:26,509
That's under 48-78H.

639
00:53:27,829 --> 00:53:36,411
And we also have a reference to six months in 48-78I, subsection 2, which also made a reference to a six-month demolition delay.

640
00:53:36,711 --> 00:53:40,372
And the recommendation of the committee was to strike that and replace it with 12 months.

641
00:53:40,772 --> 00:53:51,514
So the committee made an initial recommendation to change the purview of homes that are subject to a demolition delay from houses that were built before 1900 to houses that were built within the last 75 years.

642
00:53:51,554 --> 00:53:53,775
So that would be a rolling scale.

643
00:53:54,386 --> 00:53:57,368
Um, we also agreed to give a 12 month demolition delay.

644
00:53:58,168 --> 00:54:06,933
And then there was new language that was reported out favorably, which said that, um, the commission would have the right to petition the city council for a delay of an additional six months.

645
00:54:06,953 --> 00:54:11,155
So that would give us 18 months of demolition delay if they could show that certain criteria weren't met.

646
00:54:11,575 --> 00:54:13,837
And that was the recommendation that was reported out of the subcommittee.

647
00:54:14,177 --> 00:54:23,262
And that, uh, if I could, again, through the chair, that was all agreed to or arrived at with input from the commission and also, uh, the city solicitor.

648
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:24,380
At Alia?

649
00:54:25,701 --> 00:54:28,243
That is correct, Mr. President, Councilor De La Russo.

650
00:54:28,363 --> 00:54:31,346
The commission and the council met on that.

651
00:54:31,466 --> 00:54:36,790
The language changes were minor in nature and didn't raise any question or concern about legality.

652
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:47,698
When we started getting into a two year demolition delay and some of the changes that were in place, some concerns came up relative to whether or not there would be legal standing as to whether or not that was a land taking.

653
00:54:48,939 --> 00:54:52,922
Some questions and concerns about financing of projects and stuff, stuff that really,

654
00:54:53,821 --> 00:54:56,883
I think warranted concern, but not stuff that should be a deal breaker.

655
00:54:57,884 --> 00:54:58,244
Number one.

656
00:54:58,264 --> 00:55:07,770
Number two, I think that, you know, moving forward, we have some recommendations from the subcommittee that met that are sitting on the table at the committee of the whole that will address the issues in the ordinance that have brought forward.

657
00:55:07,830 --> 00:55:17,235
They will extend the demolition delay period of time from six months to 18 months or a year guaranteed and potentially 18 months if need be.

658
00:55:17,375 --> 00:55:19,877
And it will also change the type of home.

659
00:55:20,298 --> 00:55:21,759
that is subject to a demolition delay.

660
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:23,920
And that's something that I could support this evening, Mr. President.

661
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:31,344
I have the subsections and the languages, uh, the language, um, performing this evening and I'm writing it up, uh, right now for the city clerk and I'll present that by way of emotion.

662
00:55:31,644 --> 00:55:31,925
Thank you.

663
00:55:31,965 --> 00:55:43,751
And so if I could, so then if I remember correctly, we were prepared to have committed the whole meeting on those proposals, uh, yet we're asked not to buy the commission.

664
00:55:44,272 --> 00:55:48,434
So they had additional, uh, additional items that they wanted to put on.

665
00:55:49,182 --> 00:55:57,289
And then once we got those, the sequence of events happened that we haven't met.

666
00:55:57,609 --> 00:56:01,032
Mr. President, I'm not prepared to vote on this tonight.

667
00:56:01,232 --> 00:56:13,162
I think we need to sort out what has to be done, do that in the Committee of the Whole, at your discretion, Mr. President, and also have the assistance, the paper was reported out to Committee of the Whole.

668
00:56:13,945 --> 00:56:20,186
And I have the assistance of the city solicitor present with us to lend his expertise.

669
00:56:21,646 --> 00:56:27,087
I'm not at this point asking to table.

670
00:56:27,627 --> 00:56:31,748
I will not support the motion that's before us to vote and approve this.

671
00:56:32,268 --> 00:56:43,330
I'm not going to support an ordinance change without three readings until we have clear language and the opportunity to come to clarity on this.

672
00:56:44,012 --> 00:56:45,093
with papers before us.

673
00:56:45,213 --> 00:56:45,573
Thank you.

674
00:56:46,734 --> 00:56:47,414
Counselor Falco.

675
00:56:48,135 --> 00:56:48,795
Thank you, Mr. President.

676
00:56:48,815 --> 00:56:59,203
I just wanted to, uh, just go on the record of, um, you know, I was a member of the subcommittee that has been, um, that met with the commission and, uh, has been working on the ordinance changes.

677
00:56:59,263 --> 00:57:02,705
I mean, I definitely support, uh, you know, updating the ordinance.

678
00:57:02,785 --> 00:57:05,747
I think we need to do more to protect, protect our historic homes.

679
00:57:05,827 --> 00:57:12,812
I mean, you know, as, as time goes on and we see these homes disappear, it really, uh, you know, has a negative impact on the,

680
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:16,580
it really changes the fabric of our neighborhoods and we need to do more.

681
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:27,106
Um, you know, the, the, the, the subcommittee has been working, um, to actually make changes to the resolution, uh, to the, uh, ordinance to actually do more to protect historic homes.

682
00:57:27,406 --> 00:57:30,467
And, uh, so far, I mean, I know we've been working hard on that.

683
00:57:30,507 --> 00:57:32,128
We've been working hard with the commission.

684
00:57:32,589 --> 00:57:36,531
Um, and I do support extending the, uh, demolition delay as well.

685
00:57:36,651 --> 00:57:40,213
So I just want to go on the record of saying that, but, um, I do support this resolution.

686
00:57:40,373 --> 00:57:40,633
Thank you.

687
00:57:45,025 --> 00:57:45,866
And you're good.

688
00:57:46,086 --> 00:57:46,246
Yes.

689
00:57:46,266 --> 00:57:46,866
Thank you.

690
00:57:46,886 --> 00:57:49,048
Name and address of the record, please.

691
00:57:49,368 --> 00:57:57,213
It's Ryan Hayward, 40 Sharon nav Medford, uh, counselors and friends of Medford history promise to be succinct tonight.

692
00:57:57,773 --> 00:58:09,101
Tonight I stand before you as the chairman of the Medford historical commission where the official municipal bodies charged with the preservation, promotion and development of historical assets of our hometown.

693
00:58:10,061 --> 00:58:15,147
One of the many ways we accomplish our mission is by administering the demo delay, which is before you tonight.

694
00:58:15,688 --> 00:58:18,791
And it was adopted in 1994 by this very board.

695
00:58:19,912 --> 00:58:24,597
It was established for protecting the city's significant historical, cultural, and architectural buildings.

696
00:58:24,838 --> 00:58:30,684
And if invoked, the delay period is a maximum currently of six months and only applicable to buildings built before 1900.

697
00:58:32,012 --> 00:58:39,914
The intent of this pause is so that the applicant can make reasonable, continued, and bona fide efforts to save the irreplaceable asset.

698
00:58:40,654 --> 00:58:44,875
In most cases, however, the commission has found that the existing bylaw is ineffective.

699
00:58:48,496 --> 00:58:53,417
And the commission has found that we have little influence over the course of action.

700
00:58:53,637 --> 00:58:58,238
Scores of developers, absentee landlords, neglectful property owners,

701
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:04,726
and profit seekers have chosen to wait out that short timeline and even build it into their schedules at this point.

702
00:59:05,687 --> 00:59:10,472
We have found that there is an unsettling trend towards demolition rather than renovation.

703
00:59:11,033 --> 00:59:17,740
Applications have tripled in the last three years alone, and many of these were notable landmarks that we knew and loved.

704
00:59:18,958 --> 00:59:27,001
The time now is to overhaul this bylaw and make it an effective preservation tool through Councilor Knight and now through Councilor Longo Cohen.

705
00:59:27,382 --> 00:59:39,807
I respectfully request that the city council immediately move forward with the demolition delay revision of chapter 48 article four as presented in subcommittee to the demo delay subcommittee last September.

706
00:59:39,887 --> 00:59:43,148
This is not the original bylaw that was proposed before that.

707
00:59:43,548 --> 00:59:47,410
I respectfully disagree with Councilor Knight that the commission had no input on that.

708
00:59:47,918 --> 00:59:52,262
And then, unfortunately, we got word after the fact that that subcommittee did vote.

709
00:59:52,362 --> 00:59:55,464
And so we put forth our own proposal, which went to subcommittee.

710
00:59:58,347 --> 01:00:04,232
Highlights of these changes include much needed revisions to the definitions, changes to the reviews and timeline.

711
01:00:04,577 --> 01:00:15,767
including buildings that are 50 years old to be in compliance with our certified local government status and the national park service, including language to discourage demolition by neglect.

712
01:00:15,887 --> 01:00:25,336
And most importantly, changing the timeline from six months to two years to give this board the leverage it needs to influence projects involving our historic buildings.

713
01:00:26,277 --> 01:00:31,101
By extending the demo delay, we will join scores of other communities that have said yes to better projects,

714
01:00:31,608 --> 01:00:37,111
Yes to preservation and yes to ensuring that we have something to leave behind for the next generation.

715
01:00:37,752 --> 01:00:48,478
I look to you all for your support as it should be clear that you have our support and I'm happy to answer any questions that you guys have on this as you guys move forward in process.

716
01:00:49,959 --> 01:00:54,662
Just to be clear too, the question was raised about properties that were up for demolition.

717
01:00:54,982 --> 01:00:59,965
I mentioned in my annual report that I will have sent to the mayor tomorrow

718
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:03,984
There were 18 properties that came under review last year.

719
01:01:04,404 --> 01:01:07,568
Only six of them fell under the demolition delay, but we reviewed...

720
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:15,103
I reviewed personally, at least double that amount that were not applicable to the review, unfortunately.

721
01:01:15,163 --> 01:01:19,546
So we're losing buildings on a month-to-month basis, and sometimes more than that.

722
01:01:20,146 --> 01:01:32,873
There are six buildings that have already come up, two of which are currently going through the process of demo delay review, one on Codding Street, one on Walnut Street, which is just coming up for the first leg.

723
01:01:33,539 --> 01:01:40,343
And then there's, I've heard, gotten word that there's another building just down the street from the other Codding Street building, which is currently under review.

724
01:01:40,684 --> 01:01:51,991
So there are several buildings which are coming up and just being bought, all of which have been owned by long-time owners, absentee landlords at this point, or have approached owners to sell their historic buildings.

725
01:01:52,111 --> 01:01:56,974
So this is an ever-increasing problem that I see will not be going away in the near future.

726
01:01:57,114 --> 01:02:01,517
So by changing this bylaw and doing it right now and doing it once,

727
01:02:01,953 --> 01:02:09,457
and being all-inclusive, it will afford us some time to be able to continue to influence projects in lieu of zoning until you guys are ready to change zoning.

728
01:02:12,859 --> 01:02:13,680
Councilor Longo-Kurt.

729
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:15,080
Thank you, President Carviello.

730
01:02:15,341 --> 01:02:18,762
Thank you for your, um, for coming tonight and explaining that to the council.

731
01:02:19,223 --> 01:02:26,747
If I could ask you a question with regards to reviewing the entire ordinance and committee of the whole within the next month or two, um, if we wait,

732
01:02:27,145 --> 01:02:33,409
to put a demo delay and we don't vote on it tonight, what does that mean if it's postponed one, two, three, four months?

733
01:02:33,649 --> 01:02:40,854
There's going to be additional demo requests that are going to get grandfathered in and we're not going to be able to stop it.

734
01:02:40,914 --> 01:02:41,274
Correct.

735
01:02:41,315 --> 01:02:47,839
I think you're going to find that there's going to be one of these huge rushes on demolition that anybody who might be even whispering or thinking demolition

736
01:02:48,512 --> 01:02:49,972
will put forth an application.

737
01:02:50,312 --> 01:02:57,074
Long-time owners who might be thinking of selling will probably put forth an application just so that they can clear the table and clear the hurdle long before.

738
01:02:57,474 --> 01:03:01,675
Because right now, there is no limit on the timeline of determination.

739
01:03:01,735 --> 01:03:09,816
So once we make a determination on whether a building is or isn't, unless there's significant reason to change that finding, it's a forever decision.

740
01:03:09,996 --> 01:03:14,137
So people can wait out the six-month delay the moment that they have it.

741
01:03:14,237 --> 01:03:17,238
And even if they're not selling, then sell the building is a vacant lot.

742
01:03:17,863 --> 01:03:19,246
So there is no recourse.

743
01:03:19,828 --> 01:03:23,677
And just to make it clear, you don't have a developer

744
01:03:25,020 --> 01:03:30,505
the property to put in a demo delay, they just have to get approval and signature by the current owner, isn't that correct?

745
01:03:30,565 --> 01:03:31,025
Correct.

746
01:03:31,546 --> 01:03:46,880
In the current case of 18 Walnut, which is coming up for review, the developer is acting as the owner's representative, and I have received a letter of approval from the current building owner, giving him permission to apply for demolition.

747
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:50,543
So even before he owns the property, an applicant can

748
01:03:51,118 --> 01:03:58,901
you know, apply for the demolition and then just wait it out and have an active purchase and sales agreement and then move forward with a vacant lot as soon as they're ready.

749
01:04:00,041 --> 01:04:11,385
As one, one counselor to the chair, I don't see any reason why we can't vote to increase the demo delay tonight, especially where committees reviewed it and move forward with recommendations.

750
01:04:11,725 --> 01:04:20,028
Um, as well as in addition, I'd like to amend my resolve to include that any property 75 years or older be, um, I,

751
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:30,787
75 years or 75 years or older as the committee, um, discussed and reviewed and put forward, um, that that be reviewable by the historic commission.

752
01:04:32,268 --> 01:04:32,608
Thank you.

753
01:04:35,210 --> 01:04:35,591
I'm sorry.

754
01:04:35,611 --> 01:04:36,271
I missed it.

755
01:04:36,491 --> 01:04:38,353
Are you asking me if it's, okay.

756
01:04:38,613 --> 01:04:38,913
Thank you.

757
01:04:38,953 --> 01:04:39,233
Okay.

758
01:04:39,373 --> 01:04:39,854
Anything else?

759
01:04:41,035 --> 01:04:41,335
Thank you.

760
01:04:41,475 --> 01:04:41,855
Thank you.

761
01:04:44,637 --> 01:04:45,698
Name and address of the record, please.

762
01:04:46,238 --> 01:04:46,759
Yes.

763
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:49,261
Doug Carr, one 24 Boston Avenue, West Benefit.

764
01:04:49,301 --> 01:04:50,962
I serve and have served with Ryan.

765
01:04:51,742 --> 01:04:53,843
on the historic commission for the past four years.

766
01:04:54,643 --> 01:04:55,623
I want to echo what he said.

767
01:04:55,663 --> 01:05:04,946
It's been really, um, a snowballing effect in the city of Medford in the last couple of years as these properties, um, have come one after another.

768
01:05:05,386 --> 01:05:13,648
And it's been a challenge for us because we haven't had the tools we need to protect the resources that we know we want to preserve for the longterm.

769
01:05:14,388 --> 01:05:17,609
And I would recommend, um, that 12 months is not enough.

770
01:05:17,629 --> 01:05:18,670
18 is a minimum.

771
01:05:18,690 --> 01:05:19,190
24 is preferred.

772
01:05:20,471 --> 01:05:27,432
Keep in mind that the commission, at any time during that period, can reduce that if they're getting cooperation with the developer.

773
01:05:28,053 --> 01:05:29,593
It's not all inclusive.

774
01:05:29,633 --> 01:05:32,373
If they decide to save the building, we can immediately end it or amend it.

775
01:05:32,393 --> 01:05:36,774
Or if they decide to renovate or add on to the building, there's ways that we can reduce it.

776
01:05:36,794 --> 01:05:37,975
But it gives us that leverage.

777
01:05:38,715 --> 01:05:41,675
The leverage is the key with this thing, because we have virtually no leverage.

778
01:05:41,715 --> 01:05:44,936
If somebody comes in on September, the demo delay

779
01:05:45,581 --> 01:05:48,462
All they're doing is waiting out the winter, which they're not going to build anyway, most of the time.

780
01:05:48,482 --> 01:05:51,363
So it really is meaningless for a lot of developers if they time it right.

781
01:05:52,344 --> 01:05:55,945
Um, so I think that's really important that it's truly a minimum of 18 perfectly 24.

782
01:05:56,405 --> 01:06:00,587
Um, and that we, uh, execute this as quickly as possible.

783
01:06:01,327 --> 01:06:02,908
I would like to echo something that counts.

784
01:06:02,928 --> 01:06:06,490
One of the council has said earlier that we're really missing.

785
01:06:06,710 --> 01:06:09,131
This is a first piece of several pieces.

786
01:06:09,311 --> 01:06:12,532
You're missing a lot of pieces when it comes to planning in the city of Medford.

787
01:06:13,438 --> 01:06:17,720
You don't have any design review in Medford for any building under 10,000 square feet.

788
01:06:18,380 --> 01:06:21,901
So you can't control anything about a new building.

789
01:06:22,622 --> 01:06:24,082
You have no tools in which to do that.

790
01:06:24,422 --> 01:06:26,443
And this has been brought before the council many years ago.

791
01:06:27,223 --> 01:06:28,224
It didn't go anywhere.

792
01:06:28,524 --> 01:06:33,966
But I think the effort needs to be revived because design review is something that a lot of cities and towns have.

793
01:06:34,426 --> 01:06:36,227
It gets a higher quality development.

794
01:06:37,175 --> 01:06:40,636
It forces developers who would put cookie cutter buildings to not do that.

795
01:06:41,316 --> 01:06:49,717
And one of our developers who's put up a building, they're just taking a building they built anywhere and plopping it down in every neighborhood they can.

796
01:06:49,737 --> 01:06:55,438
It has nothing to do with the character, context, or anything about the quality of the neighborhood.

797
01:06:56,118 --> 01:06:57,379
We can't prevent that right now.

798
01:06:57,419 --> 01:07:02,800
So you need to look at demo, not only demo delay, but design review as well, which has been long overdue in the city of Medford.

799
01:07:04,140 --> 01:07:05,460
Another thing that's missing here,

800
01:07:06,719 --> 01:07:07,779
is planning capacity.

801
01:07:08,119 --> 01:07:11,200
We don't have enough planning capacity in Medford.

802
01:07:11,861 --> 01:07:13,021
I know Lauren and Claude upstairs.

803
01:07:13,061 --> 01:07:13,941
I've known them for 20 years.

804
01:07:13,961 --> 01:07:18,002
They do wonderful work, but they do not have enough people to do what they need to do.

805
01:07:18,943 --> 01:07:21,743
We need a complete rewrite of zoning right now in the city of Medford.

806
01:07:21,763 --> 01:07:28,445
That's why every project in the city needs multiple variances, because we have zoning that has frozen in time in 1960.

807
01:07:28,825 --> 01:07:34,187
You need 2.1 cars, whether you're 100 feet from a T station or two miles from a T station.

808
01:07:34,830 --> 01:07:38,771
So the planning aspect of the city is just completely outdated.

809
01:07:38,791 --> 01:07:42,531
And I know the council has voted monies to increase the staff in last year's budget.

810
01:07:43,311 --> 01:07:44,852
But as of right now, that hasn't happened.

811
01:07:45,492 --> 01:07:48,112
So the planning capacity of Medford is critical.

812
01:07:48,232 --> 01:07:58,834
And I found it, frankly, embarrassing that the master plan for the city of Medford, which is now 12 years old and largely unexecuted, we still can't get to this day.

813
01:07:58,874 --> 01:08:03,935
We're executing little pieces of it here and there with grants rather than with in-house planning and expertise.

814
01:08:04,617 --> 01:08:21,882
So planning is the umbrella and zoning, demo delay is one of these components, but there are two or three other legs of the stool that will help Medford get a higher quality built environment, preserve our historic architecture, and give us a better quality of new construction across the board.

815
01:08:22,422 --> 01:08:28,984
So I urge you all to pass this as quickly as possible, 18 or 24 months, but then start addressing the other concerns as well.

816
01:08:29,344 --> 01:08:29,665
Thank you.

817
01:08:30,425 --> 01:08:30,745
Thank you.

818
01:08:36,109 --> 01:08:37,149
Name, address, and the record, please.

819
01:08:37,509 --> 01:08:39,210
Jean Nuzzo, 35 Parris Street.

820
01:08:39,430 --> 01:08:40,070
I apologize.

821
01:08:40,090 --> 01:08:41,051
I have a bit of a cold.

822
01:08:42,811 --> 01:08:49,873
So being an owner's project manager in construction and development, I work in facts.

823
01:08:50,534 --> 01:08:58,536
And I have a few facts that I'd like to put before you for consideration as you think about this demo delay and development in the city of Medford.

824
01:08:59,736 --> 01:09:03,678
Currently, today, the city of Medford has 13 properties

825
01:09:05,016 --> 01:09:06,038
listed for sale.

826
01:09:06,579 --> 01:09:07,722
Thirteen, that's it.

827
01:09:09,024 --> 01:09:15,939
Of those thirteen, three are in condo complexes that were designed to be condo complexes.

828
01:09:17,211 --> 01:09:28,076
Four are two-family or three-family homes that have been condoized, and the remaining eight are listed single or two-family.

829
01:09:28,697 --> 01:09:35,820
Of those eight, four are listed with some variation of attention developers and contractors.

830
01:09:37,109 --> 01:09:38,590
So that's what's going on in our city.

831
01:09:39,271 --> 01:09:56,305
It is being positioned and sold as a place where some person, male or female, with a truck, some tools, and some capital, can come in here, quickly pick up a property, and do whatever they want with it.

832
01:09:57,386 --> 01:09:59,188
That's what's happening in the city of Medford.

833
01:10:00,838 --> 01:10:08,520
Another pertinent point of information that I think you need to understand and consider is what our price-to-rent ratio is in Medford.

834
01:10:08,620 --> 01:10:10,121
Well, what's a price-to-rent ratio?

835
01:10:11,021 --> 01:10:22,485
It's where you take the value of a property that's for sale, put it over the rent times 12 months a year.

836
01:10:23,718 --> 01:10:26,020
The city of Medford right now sits roughly at 17.4.

837
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:33,346
There are four cities in the state of Massachusetts that are higher than Medford.

838
01:10:33,986 --> 01:10:38,450
Beacon Hill, the Back Bay, the South End, and South Boston.

839
01:10:39,050 --> 01:10:42,874
Cambridge and Somerville are irrelevant because they have been gentrified.

840
01:10:43,374 --> 01:10:45,356
This is a measure of gentrification.

841
01:10:46,017 --> 01:10:47,438
What is gentrification?

842
01:10:48,119 --> 01:10:56,106
It is that mechanism that pushes the people who live in a city out because they can cease to afford to live here.

843
01:10:58,132 --> 01:11:20,732
That mechanism that takes potentially a resident who lives in a historic building and encourages them to sell because of what's happening around them and the recognition that their taxes are going to get to the point where they're not going to be able to afford to live in the city that they have raised a family in and chosen to stay in and potentially to age and place in.

844
01:11:21,513 --> 01:11:33,944
So, this measurement, the four cities that are above us, I want you to think about, Back Bay, South Boston, Beacon Hill, those are some pretty significant price point opportunities.

845
01:11:34,585 --> 01:11:36,867
And I don't discourage those types of price points.

846
01:11:37,187 --> 01:11:42,712
I think in the nature of real estate, they're critical, but we're getting a false inflation

847
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:56,748
that's happening here because we're losing our two-family and three-family homes, which are a mechanism for young families and individuals to buy a piece of property and be able to afford it because of the rental capacity.

848
01:11:57,968 --> 01:12:17,285
What's critical about this is that these two-family and three-family projects that these, quote, developers, or as I call them, flippers, come in, they come in and they buy that property, and because it's less than 10 units, they're not required to put in any affordable housing.

849
01:12:18,186 --> 01:12:19,668
So they're making all profit.

850
01:12:20,309 --> 01:12:32,147
So there's a misnomer that this development is going to benefit our housing market and drop the value of property so that it's affordable because we're going to increase our stock.

851
01:12:33,028 --> 01:12:49,542
simply not going to happen by converting two families and three families and parceling off double lots and making exceptions for nonconforming units to put in another two family or three family, because those developers are not going to sell it at an affordable rate.

852
01:12:49,822 --> 01:12:51,003
That's not what's happening.

853
01:12:51,163 --> 01:12:52,784
That's not what's going to happen.

854
01:12:53,385 --> 01:12:55,226
Not unless we make a decision.

855
01:12:55,987 --> 01:13:09,260
We as a city voted, tonight you as a committee voted to affirm the appointments of a CPA that is looking as part of their process to preserve both building and green space.

856
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:18,909
And yet we continue to allow, quote, developers to come in and parcel our large lots and put up these

857
01:13:19,970 --> 01:13:31,700
Fast prefab Fabricated in a factory somewhere building that is a fraction of what they would pay for stick build construction They're not bringing jobs.

858
01:13:32,021 --> 01:13:41,249
They're simply lining their pockets in my opinion and my observation so I think that there's a message that can be sent here tonight by this committee and

859
01:13:41,809 --> 01:13:44,410
And the message is, the line is drawn.

860
01:13:45,010 --> 01:13:57,094
We welcome developers, but we welcome developers that come with a purpose, that come with a desire to collaborate, and that want to improve the city as well as make a profit.

861
01:13:57,374 --> 01:14:02,935
And I think the fastest way to send that message is to say, yes, no more six months.

862
01:14:03,516 --> 01:14:04,516
Now it's 12, it's 18, it's 24.

863
01:14:04,716 --> 01:14:05,636
It's 12 with two options.

864
01:14:08,637 --> 01:14:15,362
whatever, but I would encourage you to do it because tonight is an opportunity to send one of two messages.

865
01:14:16,002 --> 01:14:29,511
That we're here and as a city we're going to stand and support our history and the culture that we want to develop as a group or we're going to sit aside and we're going to let people who are here to make a profit take advantage of us.

866
01:14:30,031 --> 01:14:30,732
Thank you for your time.

867
01:14:39,077 --> 01:14:40,277
I even address the record, please.

868
01:14:40,577 --> 01:14:40,798
Yes.

869
01:14:41,138 --> 01:14:43,758
Uh, Chris Bader again, uh, Trinity high street.

870
01:14:44,239 --> 01:14:45,899
I'm the chair of the historic district commission.

871
01:14:46,359 --> 01:14:59,303
Um, I just wanted to say that the historic district commission, which of course is rather confusingly separate from the historical commission, uh, voted unanimously at our last meeting to support this resolution.

872
01:14:59,683 --> 01:15:03,044
And, um, uh, I would ask you, I would ask you for your support as well.

873
01:15:04,205 --> 01:15:04,485
Thank you.

874
01:15:09,284 --> 01:15:10,864
Name and address of the record, please.

875
01:15:10,924 --> 01:15:14,505
Tom Lincoln, 27 Gleason Street in sunny Medford.

876
01:15:14,545 --> 01:15:15,186
Well, it's not sunny.

877
01:15:16,126 --> 01:15:25,668
I've been heavily involved in historic preservation and related issues with the Royal House and the slave quarters, of course, and the Brooks Estate, as well as other projects.

878
01:15:26,448 --> 01:15:29,509
My wife and I moved here close to 30 years ago.

879
01:15:29,569 --> 01:15:30,189
It's hard to believe.

880
01:15:31,550 --> 01:15:35,931
And one reason, one big reason, is the historical fabric of the city.

881
01:15:36,590 --> 01:15:45,235
And unfortunately, in that period, we've seen some fairly regrettable losses of historical fabric and architectural fabric.

882
01:15:46,456 --> 01:15:49,418
It's not to say that every building deserves to be saved.

883
01:15:50,698 --> 01:15:52,059
We do live in a capitalist.

884
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:53,040
Excuse me.

885
01:15:56,146 --> 01:15:58,428
If the gentleman has due respect at the podium, please.

886
01:15:58,508 --> 01:15:59,409
Sorry.

887
01:15:59,469 --> 01:16:13,480
That every building deserves to be saved, but certainly there needs to be a process where we can have careful consideration, use some creativity, encourage outside money or inside money and developers to do the

888
01:16:14,648 --> 01:16:18,249
the right thing for neighborhoods and for our heritage.

889
01:16:18,549 --> 01:16:24,111
It's always true that once you lose an old building, it's not coming back.

890
01:16:24,551 --> 01:16:40,936
So I commend the council for bringing up this issue for the various boards that have advanced this cause and hope that you will extend the demolition delay period and provide other

891
01:16:42,393 --> 01:16:45,916
means for advancing this important issue.

892
01:16:46,016 --> 01:16:46,316
Thanks.

893
01:16:47,417 --> 01:16:47,757
Thank you.

894
01:16:52,421 --> 01:16:53,522
Name and address of the record, please.

895
01:16:53,602 --> 01:16:57,325
Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass, former member of the Sarkis party.

896
01:16:57,706 --> 01:17:01,309
You know, a city that forgets about its history won't have any history.

897
01:17:02,029 --> 01:17:11,557
And at the rate we're going in the city right now, the way developers have this opportunity to come in here, seize a piece of property, build upon it, and then take off and make a profit on it.

898
01:17:12,407 --> 01:17:14,648
Perfect example is Luminaires on Locust Street.

899
01:17:15,488 --> 01:17:19,670
Puts the building up, he's there a year, sells it for $61 million, and he's gone.

900
01:17:20,510 --> 01:17:23,171
But we're talking about something right now is the history of our city.

901
01:17:24,312 --> 01:17:30,854
And while Council Member Kern brings up this issue, whether it be 18 to 24 months, for which I would prefer 24, think of it like this.

902
01:17:31,494 --> 01:17:40,438
Within the past three years, you folks in a concentrated area of South Street, Toro Ave, and Walnut Street have seen historical pieces of property

903
01:17:41,058 --> 01:17:48,603
and trees, if you're a lover of trees, and trees be demolished by out-of-towners, outsiders.

904
01:17:49,023 --> 01:18:01,812
People are only here to do one thing, and that's to make a profit on the piece of property and beg upon the people to maybe sell their property, make a big profit, and leave town so they can take over, make some money, and they can leave.

905
01:18:01,872 --> 01:18:02,452
It's not right.

906
01:18:03,132 --> 01:18:08,316
We heard one of your counselors indicate that the last time you people submitted a report in October,

907
01:18:08,908 --> 01:18:12,510
It went from October to January and then it got lost somewhere in translation.

908
01:18:13,411 --> 01:18:17,793
That in and of itself is the telltale sign of what this city administration thinks about.

909
01:18:18,195 --> 01:18:21,616
preserving its history, preserving the history of neighborhoods.

910
01:18:22,337 --> 01:18:31,000
And speaking about neighborhoods, when you lose zoning in your neighborhoods, whether it's for an historical purpose or what have you, you've lost the character of your neighborhood.

911
01:18:31,981 --> 01:18:42,165
South Boston, if you've been following this for the last two weeks, is a perfect example where the residents have gotten together on the development of a gentleman who wants to come in there and take over a piece of property

912
01:18:42,765 --> 01:18:50,811
that's perfectly zoned for what he wants to do, but the neighbors are opposed to it because it doesn't fit the character of the neighborhood.

913
01:18:51,592 --> 01:18:57,317
The state representative from that area, Michael Flaherty, has proposed a piece of legislation, and I believe he's doing it tomorrow morning.

914
01:18:57,717 --> 01:19:02,921
He's proposing a piece of legislation that the character of the neighborhood has to be kept in line for that for which is there.

915
01:19:03,301 --> 01:19:11,008
It cannot be made to look anything different or obnoxious or something that's not satisfying to the public or to the people in that neighborhood.

916
01:19:12,102 --> 01:19:18,827
You know, we're not going to be here in a few years, because however God decides to take us, and when he decides to take us, so be it.

917
01:19:19,448 --> 01:19:26,313
But you guys and girl, you have an opportunity here to make the legacy of this community continue to go forward in a positive way.

918
01:19:26,993 --> 01:19:32,477
If the city administration doesn't want to have the same eye on the prize, then you people should have it.

919
01:19:32,758 --> 01:19:34,059
And the zoning should be changed.

920
01:19:34,279 --> 01:19:36,440
And the 24 months should be changed, because you'll tell you know,

921
01:19:37,261 --> 01:19:47,889
If a developer comes in here and finds out that he might have to wait 24 months to get that piece of property zoned or done for whatever he needs to do, he might think one of two things.

922
01:19:47,929 --> 01:19:51,472
Number one, I'm going to work with the people, or I'm getting out of here because I don't want to deal with it.

923
01:19:52,092 --> 01:19:52,693
And you know something?

924
01:19:52,733 --> 01:19:56,396
That's probably the best thing, because he's not the real person that should be here for the city.

925
01:19:56,676 --> 01:20:00,519
And isn't it interesting that all the people that are coming into the city are out-of-towners?

926
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:14,786
You've got to thank the people who took up the charge on Locust Street to bring it to court, to challenge the developer, for which finally found itself before your body and you folks, likewise, to challenge the developer.

927
01:20:15,757 --> 01:20:21,000
The neighborhood that took on the Salem Street, the Breakpro project.

928
01:20:21,540 --> 01:20:23,461
The neighborhood people had to bring it together.

929
01:20:23,761 --> 01:20:25,002
Not the city administration.

930
01:20:25,502 --> 01:20:30,445
I don't know how many more black eyes that this city administration needs to get to find out what its history is all about.

931
01:20:31,245 --> 01:20:41,531
But you certainly are making history by destroying pieces of property that have not only historical value, they have a family and a personal and a community value.

932
01:20:42,351 --> 01:20:44,172
Do the right thing tonight, ladies and gentlemen.

933
01:20:44,613 --> 01:20:49,956
Vote for the 24 months, because within that 24 months, you can bargain or they can bargain with you.

934
01:20:50,457 --> 01:21:01,144
But at least the people of this community will know that as an elected official, at least you folks, as a city councilor, are doing the right thing in behalf of the taxpayers of this community.

935
01:21:01,344 --> 01:21:01,724
Thank you.

936
01:21:01,744 --> 01:21:10,270
Name and address of the record, please.

937
01:21:10,601 --> 01:21:11,761
Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez.

938
01:21:11,962 --> 01:21:13,422
I live at 281 Park Street.

939
01:21:14,943 --> 01:21:18,884
And the first thing that everyone says when we talk about Medford is the Medford market is hot.

940
01:21:19,284 --> 01:21:22,686
There was an article this Sunday in the Globe about, hey, Medford, move there.

941
01:21:22,746 --> 01:21:24,727
That place is great.

942
01:21:24,767 --> 01:21:28,388
And Boston Magazine had an article recently about North Medford being great.

943
01:21:28,748 --> 01:21:33,030
You know what's great about the city being great already is that we're not desperate.

944
01:21:34,077 --> 01:21:40,604
We don't have to sell to the guy who sends you that letter in the mail that says, hey, I'll buy your house site unseen for $300,000.

945
01:21:40,964 --> 01:21:41,625
Because you know what?

946
01:21:41,665 --> 01:21:44,868
There are families with children that want to move to Medford.

947
01:21:46,089 --> 01:21:47,551
Because we have a deep history.

948
01:21:47,611 --> 01:21:49,353
We have a fabulous community.

949
01:21:49,833 --> 01:21:52,836
We have a spirit of volunteerism that is unmatched in other towns.

950
01:21:53,457 --> 01:21:53,957
And you know what?

951
01:21:55,130 --> 01:21:58,651
Paul Revere rode through here yesterday, and it was a very different Medford.

952
01:21:58,711 --> 01:22:01,272
We need to hold on to those pieces of history.

953
01:22:01,932 --> 01:22:10,534
Back in the day that I was at Medford High, Dr. Valeriani, AP US History, sent us all out to research our homes, to trace the history.

954
01:22:10,574 --> 01:22:14,315
And we went into the tombs of the Cambridge District Court and traced the history.

955
01:22:14,876 --> 01:22:18,477
And the home, my childhood home, was a beautiful double lot.

956
01:22:18,977 --> 01:22:22,078
I won't give the address, because I don't want any developers going in and destroying it.

957
01:22:25,288 --> 01:22:33,334
When my grandparents moved to Florida, we left the book that I had made in high school that had traced the history all the way back to the shipbuilding days.

958
01:22:33,715 --> 01:22:37,518
Because Medford is steeped with history, and it's important to all of us.

959
01:22:37,878 --> 01:22:42,381
My parents bought their home, and there were pictures of ships that had been built in the city.

960
01:22:42,802 --> 01:22:43,882
And these things are important.

961
01:22:43,963 --> 01:22:45,444
These things need to be preserved.

962
01:22:46,044 --> 01:22:50,968
I bought my own home here, and I got my own little Medford acre, which is a big yard.

963
01:22:51,448 --> 01:22:57,050
If you add up the square footage I could probably build four units but that's not what I want.

964
01:22:57,290 --> 01:22:59,650
I want to keep Medford the way that it is.

965
01:23:01,471 --> 01:23:07,893
We do need to grow and expand but we don't need to go down the streets and look in people's yards and say I could put three in there.

966
01:23:08,033 --> 01:23:08,333
I could.

967
01:23:09,093 --> 01:23:12,514
That's not the kind of building that we're looking for.

968
01:23:13,335 --> 01:23:24,338
So I think that you should definitely pass this ordinance to do the 18 to 24 demo display delay because the fastest way to get a legal opinion back from this administration is to pass something.

969
01:23:24,378 --> 01:23:25,259
And that's like, whoa.

970
01:23:26,079 --> 01:23:28,580
And then you'll have your answer inside of a week, definitely.

971
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:33,902
And with all due respect, if I put in and look, I'm looking for information and I don't get follow-up,

972
01:23:34,642 --> 01:23:43,969
From the person I sent out to, I'll keep bothering them every two weeks, every month, because August 2016, not having an answer is totally unacceptable.

973
01:23:44,229 --> 01:23:49,833
And I understand that people in this administration are busy, but if this is important to us, zoning is important to us.

974
01:23:50,673 --> 01:23:52,255
Point of information, Councilor Knight.

975
01:23:52,455 --> 01:23:56,297
August 2016 was when the zoning subcommittee issued its report.

976
01:23:56,397 --> 01:23:58,419
September 2016 was when the, um,

977
01:24:00,161 --> 01:24:02,523
district committee, the commission presented their changes.

978
01:24:02,643 --> 01:24:06,767
So there was a month and a month break between when the council was moving forward.

979
01:24:07,348 --> 01:24:13,574
And when did this, when the commission came before the council and then we asked those questions, but their questions got asked after August, 2016.

980
01:24:15,035 --> 01:24:15,315
Thank you.

981
01:24:15,335 --> 01:24:15,796
Counselor Knight.

982
01:24:16,493 --> 01:24:19,774
Well, September, that's a big difference, that 30 days.

983
01:24:19,874 --> 01:24:20,634
I mean, keep waiting.

984
01:24:21,134 --> 01:24:22,854
What are we on, seven months now?

985
01:24:23,754 --> 01:24:25,015
I feel like this is important.

986
01:24:25,295 --> 01:24:32,256
Every time I go down to the building office and I look through those books, I see demo permit, demo permit, demo permit.

987
01:24:33,096 --> 01:24:35,116
This needs to be done now.

988
01:24:35,156 --> 01:24:35,897
We don't have time.

989
01:24:35,957 --> 01:24:41,578
If you wait six more months to put this in committee, I'm not sure how long that moratorium has been in the committee.

990
01:24:41,638 --> 01:24:42,958
I waited, was at a meeting.

991
01:24:44,038 --> 01:24:46,740
For your subcommittee and you're waiting for an opinion on that as well.

992
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:51,583
These things are happening and they're happening now and Once these houses are not done.

993
01:24:51,603 --> 01:24:52,003
They're gone.

994
01:24:52,043 --> 01:24:53,384
You can't rebuild you can't.

995
01:24:53,444 --> 01:24:56,586
Oh, well, let's rebuild that 1890 house We never should have knocked it down.

996
01:24:56,906 --> 01:25:11,856
It's gonna be too late So we need to move faster because we don't need any more prefab Condos that are going up that cost more than a single-family house and single-family houses people are desperate to get those in this city So, I don't know why we want to knock them down Thank you

997
01:25:18,917 --> 01:25:20,058
Name and address of the record, please.

998
01:25:20,378 --> 01:25:22,479
Sharon Guzik, 10 Manning Street.

999
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:30,443
Unfortunately, I'm just going to repeat a lot of what everybody else said, but I'll try to make that fast.

1000
01:25:30,543 --> 01:25:32,284
And I'm going to try to add some color.

1001
01:25:33,685 --> 01:25:47,393
I happen to live in the neighborhood that Bob Penta mentioned, which has had developers, specific developer that has come in and discovered

1002
01:25:48,451 --> 01:25:59,668
The neighborhoods ripe for the picking and the points that were being made about losing open space because you can build more than one house on that lot.

1003
01:26:03,454 --> 01:26:09,599
and losing historic trees, which I'm sure you're all familiar with that.

1004
01:26:09,780 --> 01:26:18,607
Those pieces don't actually speak to the resolution that Brianna put forward, but they are important to us.

1005
01:26:19,087 --> 01:26:22,210
And as you heard with 21 Turo Ave, they have

1006
01:26:25,725 --> 01:26:35,551
You know, by making it a historic district, we have, as a city, have some control over what happens to that whole piece of property, the lot.

1007
01:26:36,852 --> 01:26:54,584
We can't do that for every house, obviously, but we can tighten the demolition regulations, ordinances, and give the Medford Historical Commission the tools it needs, tools with teeth,

1008
01:26:55,667 --> 01:27:09,671
And I would strongly suggest that you go for the 24-month delay, because you have to give people pause, or they are going to come in and just wait out the six months.

1009
01:27:10,391 --> 01:27:13,752
Even if you make it 12 months, they'll wait out the 12 months.

1010
01:27:13,832 --> 01:27:23,615
It has to be long enough that somebody that's coming in and looking to, as I think it was Gene said,

1011
01:27:24,112 --> 01:27:25,934
that she calls it flipping.

1012
01:27:26,274 --> 01:27:32,019
They're looking to get a property, demolish what's on it, subdivide it, and build whatever they can.

1013
01:27:34,381 --> 01:27:39,005
In my neighborhood, as I said, the character has been changed.

1014
01:27:39,620 --> 01:27:41,921
by one developer single-handedly.

1015
01:27:42,361 --> 01:27:47,963
We've gotten a prefab duplex next to grandfather's house on South Street.

1016
01:27:49,484 --> 01:27:57,667
A large tree that had to be 150 years old was cut down to make way for another

1017
01:27:58,708 --> 01:28:11,359
prefab two family, a house on Summer Street and another large beech tree were demolished and cut down to make way for yet another prefab duplex.

1018
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:20,767
And now there's another house being threatened with demolition, a gorgeous, well, it could use a little,

1019
01:28:22,268 --> 01:28:24,850
TLC on the outside, but you can see it has great bones.

1020
01:28:24,910 --> 01:28:27,672
It's a gorgeous, large, Queen Anne-style house.

1021
01:28:28,432 --> 01:28:39,799
Probably, I'm just guessing, I don't know, but from the 1890s era, it has a large lot, and it's very tempting.

1022
01:28:42,580 --> 01:28:47,443
We could lose this house in short order.

1023
01:28:49,304 --> 01:28:49,805
As you heard,

1024
01:28:50,934 --> 01:28:58,580
The developer's already applied for a demo permit, even though he doesn't technically own the property.

1025
01:28:58,760 --> 01:29:01,462
So he's already got the process started.

1026
01:29:02,683 --> 01:29:14,192
I don't know if there's any way we can impose a moratorium on these things happening at this point while you guys sort out whether you're going to vote for 18 or 24 months for a demo delay.

1027
01:29:19,678 --> 01:29:20,838
It just breaks my heart.

1028
01:29:21,038 --> 01:29:29,521
I'm just seeing the character of my neighborhood with all its, I call them historic houses because they're older than a hundred years old.

1029
01:29:31,142 --> 01:29:36,744
It being, you know, okay, I get too emotional about this.

1030
01:29:36,864 --> 01:29:48,868
And as somebody else pointed out, it's fallen to the citizens, the neighbors on those streets to organize and try to fight for keeping those houses, keeping that green space open.

1031
01:29:50,045 --> 01:29:57,849
And in most cases, it's unsuccessful.

1032
01:29:57,909 --> 01:30:13,216
The one good spot was 21 Turo, where Tufts wanted to do the right thing by the neighborhood and found a couple that wanted to live in a historic house and bring it back, restore it to its former glory.

1033
01:30:13,577 --> 01:30:14,937
And they've done a very nice job.

1034
01:30:17,205 --> 01:30:23,309
So I just wanted to emphasize that time is of utmost importance.

1035
01:30:23,429 --> 01:30:26,971
We have to get this done if we're going to save the character of our neighborhoods.

1036
01:30:28,031 --> 01:30:35,256
Right now, we're allowing developers to come in and decide what we want our neighborhoods to be.

1037
01:30:37,908 --> 01:30:40,390
We have no, as citizens, we have no recourse.

1038
01:30:40,590 --> 01:30:47,055
We need to give the tools to the historical commission to save our historic houses.

1039
01:30:47,915 --> 01:30:52,338
And you know, and Doug mentioned the other pieces that need to also be in place.

1040
01:30:52,779 --> 01:31:00,284
Um, I know that's not before you now, but you should keep it in your head and you know, work on those things as well.

1041
01:31:02,306 --> 01:31:02,366
Um,

1042
01:31:05,650 --> 01:31:09,853
Yeah, I made so many notes, I don't know what I was saying.

1043
01:31:11,994 --> 01:31:17,237
Anyway, I'll just stop there and thank you so much for listening to me ramble.

1044
01:31:23,381 --> 01:31:23,701
Thank you.

1045
01:31:23,861 --> 01:31:25,082
Name and address for the record, please.

1046
01:31:25,262 --> 01:31:27,423
John Anderson, 102 Brooks Street.

1047
01:31:28,004 --> 01:31:31,346
I'm also president of the Medford Historical Society and Museum.

1048
01:31:32,890 --> 01:31:46,480
And you can come down to our building at 10 Governors Avenue on a Sunday afternoon and see dozens upon dozens of pictures of lost Medford, buildings that are no more, many of them very beautiful.

1049
01:31:47,801 --> 01:32:00,351
And I can assure you that I speak for the hundreds of people on our mailing list in saying that we strongly support increasing the ability of our commission

1050
01:32:00,845 --> 01:32:03,506
to provide the historic preservation that we all need.

1051
01:32:03,986 --> 01:32:04,366
Thank you.

1052
01:32:11,367 --> 01:32:12,508
Name and address of the record, please.

1053
01:32:12,828 --> 01:32:14,788
David McKillop, 94 Rockland Road.

1054
01:32:16,129 --> 01:32:16,609
Good evening.

1055
01:32:16,949 --> 01:32:24,551
I guess I'm probably not going to be the most popular person right now, but I just want to be pragmatic and speak about the other side of the picture a little bit.

1056
01:32:25,811 --> 01:32:28,952
I listen to what we have to say, what everybody has to say, and I'm 100% in favor of

1057
01:32:31,706 --> 01:32:40,174
changing zoning and having historical areas of the city because I think that's incredibly popular for the preservation of the city.

1058
01:32:40,554 --> 01:32:44,297
It gives a snapshot to the future of what we were in the past.

1059
01:32:44,777 --> 01:32:47,920
However, I just want to throw something out there.

1060
01:32:48,160 --> 01:32:49,461
25 years ago, I bought my house.

1061
01:32:50,182 --> 01:32:51,883
My house was not a historical house.

1062
01:32:52,604 --> 01:32:56,527
Today, if we pass the 75 years, it is now historical.

1063
01:32:57,397 --> 01:33:12,900
Tomorrow, if I choose to tear my house down and build a beautiful new little house that my wife and I can retire in, does that mean that that may not happen because the city council has decided that my home is now a historic home.

1064
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:19,141
So as an owner of a piece of property with a home, that is a decent little home.

1065
01:33:19,421 --> 01:33:20,201
Point of information.

1066
01:33:20,261 --> 01:33:20,861
Councilor Knight.

1067
01:33:21,501 --> 01:33:25,262
Mr. McKillop, the council doesn't make the determination as to whether or not the home is historic.

1068
01:33:25,302 --> 01:33:26,022
The commission does that.

1069
01:33:26,492 --> 01:33:28,093
So all we're doing is giving them the right development.

1070
01:33:28,253 --> 01:33:28,433
Correct.

1071
01:33:28,493 --> 01:33:36,618
But if we put it to the point at the hands of the commission, how many homes in the city after 75, 90 years, how many homes become historical homes?

1072
01:33:36,638 --> 01:33:37,278
A very good question.

1073
01:33:38,419 --> 01:33:39,479
That's the point I'm trying to make.

1074
01:33:39,540 --> 01:33:42,601
At one point, the entire city becomes locked.

1075
01:33:43,282 --> 01:33:44,482
And that's what we have to consider.

1076
01:33:44,943 --> 01:33:56,029
So again, painting a clear kind of balanced picture, I think that going in the direction of trying to preserve historical homes 100 years past is an incredibly important thing.

1077
01:33:56,540 --> 01:33:57,060
Excuse me, Mr. Mayor.

1078
01:33:57,440 --> 01:33:58,600
Could we have quiet in the back there?

1079
01:33:58,620 --> 01:34:00,281
Respect the gentleman at the podium.

1080
01:34:00,581 --> 01:34:00,961
Thank you.

1081
01:34:02,261 --> 01:34:03,362
I apologize.

1082
01:34:03,462 --> 01:34:04,062
That's quite all right.

1083
01:34:04,102 --> 01:34:05,922
I mean, opinions are very welcome.

1084
01:34:06,622 --> 01:34:08,203
But we have to consider every aspect.

1085
01:34:08,243 --> 01:34:14,344
And I think that going through this process and finding the right way to make this work for everyone is the best way to go.

1086
01:34:14,404 --> 01:34:16,944
Because again, let's take a look at another example.

1087
01:34:17,365 --> 01:34:18,925
A family has a home

1088
01:34:19,385 --> 01:34:21,246
passed down generation after generation.

1089
01:34:21,286 --> 01:34:22,827
The family has increased in size.

1090
01:34:22,867 --> 01:34:24,468
The family is no longer in Medford.

1091
01:34:24,909 --> 01:34:28,371
And the last remaining people in that home have passed away.

1092
01:34:28,751 --> 01:34:30,352
Now the family wants to sell that home.

1093
01:34:30,372 --> 01:34:34,515
A developer happens to come in and wants to purchase that home.

1094
01:34:34,975 --> 01:34:40,259
Are you saying to that family they cannot maximize their potential because it is a historical home?

1095
01:34:41,059 --> 01:34:44,782
What is it we're trying to tell the taxpayers?

1096
01:34:44,842 --> 01:34:48,264
So there's two sides to the coin that have to be considered.

1097
01:34:48,764 --> 01:34:51,886
And not that I'm against everything that's been spoken about tonight.

1098
01:34:51,906 --> 01:34:58,410
I'm 100% for it because I think there's some incredibly beautiful homes in this town that have to be preserved.

1099
01:34:58,730 --> 01:35:01,311
But there are two sides to the coin that have to be looked at.

1100
01:35:01,652 --> 01:35:06,354
And that's the obligation of everyone to look at that and protect everyone.

1101
01:35:06,394 --> 01:35:11,938
So it's going to be a challenge to find the best way to come across with this and to find the best rules to make that happen.

1102
01:35:12,958 --> 01:35:13,298
Thank you.

1103
01:35:13,579 --> 01:35:13,839
Thank you.

1104
01:35:18,921 --> 01:35:20,021
Name and address of the record, please.

1105
01:35:20,041 --> 01:35:20,622
Thank you.

1106
01:35:20,642 --> 01:35:23,163
It's Ken Kraus, 50 Mystic Street.

1107
01:35:23,683 --> 01:35:31,305
Um, I wanted to speak in favor of the resolution to extend the demolition delay, uh, period for up to 24 months.

1108
01:35:32,286 --> 01:35:47,151
Um, I've observed the Medford historic, uh, commission, uh, do its work for a number of years and, uh, very impressed with, uh, the, their work, the current members, um, led by Ryan Haywood,

1109
01:35:47,659 --> 01:35:51,940
Heyward and Doug Carr, and even back when Nino Susi was involved.

1110
01:35:52,681 --> 01:36:15,388
They're extremely knowledgeable on these matters, very diligent, careful, and they're considerate and respectful, not only of the historic element and aspect, but the neighborhood and the developer's perspective.

1111
01:36:17,395 --> 01:36:23,890
They work very hard to try to come to a solution that benefits everyone.

1112
01:36:24,090 --> 01:36:24,892
And it takes time.

1113
01:36:26,102 --> 01:36:34,425
An 18- to 24-month period is not a punitive measure, or a change should not be seen as punitive.

1114
01:36:34,525 --> 01:36:46,710
What it really does is allow the commission time to thoroughly deliberate the matter and look at all alternatives.

1115
01:36:47,610 --> 01:36:54,933
It really just provides them adequate time to do their job, to do it to the best of their ability, and to do it

1116
01:36:55,449 --> 01:36:57,193
in the best interest of the community.

1117
01:36:57,253 --> 01:37:05,971
So I would urge the council to support extending the demolition day delay time up to 24 months.

1118
01:37:06,191 --> 01:37:06,512
Thank you.

1119
01:37:06,632 --> 01:37:06,893
Thank you.

1120
01:37:13,766 --> 01:37:16,807
I know I've spoken already I'll be brief.

1121
01:37:17,027 --> 01:37:19,548
I would just like to raise two points of information.

1122
01:37:20,268 --> 01:37:27,710
The first is simply by passing this that doesn't give a designation to every home as a historical property.

1123
01:37:28,191 --> 01:37:36,093
It just affords the committee the opportunity to review and decide whether a house is of historical significance.

1124
01:37:36,833 --> 01:37:41,135
The second point I'd like to raise with regard to families who've aged here.

1125
01:37:41,855 --> 01:37:45,951
and have dwindled off to the last survivors or.

1126
01:37:47,030 --> 01:37:48,591
beneficiaries to benefit.

1127
01:37:49,391 --> 01:37:52,072
Nobody lives in Medford and says, I live on a double lot.

1128
01:37:52,392 --> 01:37:55,573
Ooh, when I die, my beneficiaries are going to make a lot of money.

1129
01:37:56,094 --> 01:38:04,237
What's happening here is the developers coming in, seeing the opportunity, they're giving them market value, and they're making the profit off of themselves.

1130
01:38:04,417 --> 01:38:09,579
So the argument, I'm sorry to say, has some holes in it.

1131
01:38:09,759 --> 01:38:13,600
The people who are benefiting are not really the people who are selling.

1132
01:38:13,660 --> 01:38:15,321
It's the developers who are coming in.

1133
01:38:15,921 --> 01:38:28,349
and taking advantage of those properties because they're able to identify them and they understand the non-conforming and variance rules and how to work with the ZBA and what to do with the Office of Community Development.

1134
01:38:28,729 --> 01:38:30,470
It's not residents that are making that money.

1135
01:38:30,710 --> 01:38:31,051
Thank you.

1136
01:38:31,071 --> 01:38:33,172
Thank you.

1137
01:38:35,889 --> 01:38:37,250
Name and address of the record again, please.

1138
01:38:37,331 --> 01:38:37,491
Yep.

1139
01:38:37,651 --> 01:38:48,482
Ryan Hayward, 40 Sharon and have, uh, just to echo those previous comments on the buildings and the determination, the historical commission takes every application on a case by case basis.

1140
01:38:48,602 --> 01:38:58,973
So, you know, an applicant would really need to, you know, anybody would need to apply in order for a building to be determined, um, eligible for this demo delay and then,

1141
01:38:59,554 --> 01:39:03,479
It's a two-step process to get to the actual invocation of the demo delay.

1142
01:39:03,639 --> 01:39:07,444
So we would review the building for historic significance.

1143
01:39:07,484 --> 01:39:16,756
We usually hire a consultant or we already have had forms, MHC, Massachusetts Historical Commission inventory forms prepared for each building in the city of Medford.

1144
01:39:16,796 --> 01:39:18,598
Currently, right now, we're going through and preparing

1145
01:39:19,058 --> 01:39:23,439
hundreds of forms for various neighborhoods across Medford.

1146
01:39:23,519 --> 01:39:30,421
Right now we're working in East Medford where, just FYI, there are 900 pre-1900 buildings in that neighborhood alone.

1147
01:39:30,661 --> 01:39:34,722
It's the highest concentration of historic buildings anywhere in the city remaining.

1148
01:39:36,343 --> 01:39:40,004
Once we get past the significant process, if we deem it significant per the bylaw,

1149
01:39:40,365 --> 01:39:45,208
We have to determine whether it's preferably preserved in the interest of the city of Medford at large to save.

1150
01:39:45,728 --> 01:39:51,191
Uh, in a lot of cases, uh, we have found that that is true, but in other cases we have found that that's not true.

1151
01:39:51,231 --> 01:39:54,593
It's a higher threshold to, uh, to, you know, to achieve.

1152
01:39:55,054 --> 01:39:59,076
If we determine it's preferably preserved and significant, it invokes the demo delay.

1153
01:39:59,096 --> 01:40:03,559
It would be the exact same, but it's a long process in order to get to that point.

1154
01:40:03,879 --> 01:40:06,480
So every building is given fair review under the law.

1155
01:40:07,621 --> 01:40:07,961
Thank you.

1156
01:40:09,062 --> 01:40:09,342
Thank you.

1157
01:40:12,448 --> 01:40:12,988
Councillor Knight.

1158
01:40:13,829 --> 01:40:32,479
Mr. President, after listening to the residents in the audience come up and speak and discussing at sidebar with some of my colleagues, I'd like to propose an 18-month demolition delay for all homes within the last 75 years by amending 48-78B, by striking 1900 and replacing that with the language within the past 75 years, by amending 48-78H, by striking

1159
01:40:40,457 --> 01:40:42,819
the figure six months and replacing that with 18 months.

1160
01:40:43,419 --> 01:40:49,903
And I'd like to amend 48-78I2 by striking the figure six months and replacing that with the figure 18 months, Mr. President.

1161
01:40:51,344 --> 01:40:58,049
The proposal that came out of the subcommittee gave the commission an opportunity to petition the council for an additional six months.

1162
01:40:59,370 --> 01:41:03,433
I think that this is a paper based upon the sidebar conversations that I've had with my colleagues this evening.

1163
01:41:03,493 --> 01:41:07,015
This is something we can support this evening and that we can pass this evening and we can put it through a first reading.

1164
01:41:07,754 --> 01:41:10,717
So with that being said, Mr. President, I'd like to amend the paper to reflect such.

1165
01:41:11,578 --> 01:41:13,139
Are you making that motion Councilor Knight?

1166
01:41:13,339 --> 01:41:13,779
I just did.

1167
01:41:13,799 --> 01:41:17,142
Do we have a second on Councilor Knight's motion?

1168
01:41:17,182 --> 01:41:18,243
Second.

1169
01:41:18,263 --> 01:41:18,804
Move for question.

1170
01:41:19,584 --> 01:41:20,966
Second on Councilor Knight's motion.

1171
01:41:22,927 --> 01:41:23,728
Councilor Longo-Kurin.

1172
01:41:24,369 --> 01:41:25,970
Thank you, President Carviello.

1173
01:41:25,990 --> 01:41:30,854
I want to thank Councilor Knight and the rest of my colleagues for moving forward on this tonight.

1174
01:41:30,874 --> 01:41:34,257
I heard loud and clear that the commission wants the 24 months.

1175
01:41:35,763 --> 01:41:37,344
I understand maybe the votes aren't there.

1176
01:41:37,704 --> 01:41:48,491
So I'm happy with the 18 months, but I, I do want to go on record as I'm supporting the 24 month demo delay as I think that is something that it's going to give teeth to changing the ordinance.

1177
01:41:48,671 --> 01:41:52,074
I think 18 months is great, but I think 24 months would be better.

1178
01:41:52,354 --> 01:41:53,514
I just wanted to go on record.

1179
01:41:54,715 --> 01:41:55,035
Thank you.

1180
01:41:55,055 --> 01:41:58,257
Name and address of the record, please.

1181
01:41:58,578 --> 01:42:01,259
Andrew Castaneda, Cushing street method, Massachusetts.

1182
01:42:02,420 --> 01:42:05,202
Um, I'm for historical preservation.

1183
01:42:06,837 --> 01:42:13,402
As a matter of fact, if I may tell you a short story, you might find it interesting, although most of the people behind me, I'm sure, know this story already.

1184
01:42:14,283 --> 01:42:32,337
I lived in 41 Mystic Avenue for 25 years in a three-family, which was originally a single family, that was originally next to Gaffey's, Captain Isaac Hall's house.

1185
01:42:32,997 --> 01:42:34,178
And they moved that house.

1186
01:42:34,659 --> 01:42:35,699
I have no idea when.

1187
01:42:36,642 --> 01:42:41,406
before I was born, where Governor Zav is today.

1188
01:42:41,966 --> 01:42:53,335
They moved it instead of destroying it over a hundred years ago in order to make Governor's Avenue a reasonable facsimile of Commonwealth Avenue in Boston, from what I understand.

1189
01:42:54,496 --> 01:42:57,978
How they got it across the Karate Bridge, I have no idea.

1190
01:42:58,399 --> 01:42:59,700
That probably explains why those

1191
01:43:02,527 --> 01:43:04,768
200-year-old floors were sagging.

1192
01:43:05,108 --> 01:43:09,410
The house was built in the 1750s, before Pas Revere.

1193
01:43:09,910 --> 01:43:12,652
Pas Revere went right by it, before they pulled governors out.

1194
01:43:12,672 --> 01:43:13,452
That's where the house was.

1195
01:43:13,932 --> 01:43:17,054
Captain Isaac Hall had three sons, if I understand correctly.

1196
01:43:17,714 --> 01:43:19,235
And I was the first of three sons.

1197
01:43:20,615 --> 01:43:23,737
I won't get into the fact that they married three sisters from Cambridge.

1198
01:43:24,697 --> 01:43:30,980
However, by the way, historical designation can be complicated, I'm sure.

1199
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:35,801
I'm sure there's different entities that classify it, whatever strength of power they have.

1200
01:43:35,961 --> 01:43:36,301
I don't know.

1201
01:43:36,781 --> 01:43:45,543
You have the federal, you have state, city, and I presume there's others, including possibly Middlesex County that I'm not aware of.

1202
01:43:45,563 --> 01:43:59,727
But you should also consider the new growth as not anti-American, especially if we can fix up some blighted properties.

1203
01:44:02,447 --> 01:44:15,774
And as far as gentrification, as the lady had spoken earlier, I don't believe we would have much gentrification, even if real estate taxes, the real estate values, the prices, valuations went up drastically.

1204
01:44:17,475 --> 01:44:31,483
But if you don't use that new growth from the new development to offset Prop 2.5 increases, then we will be pushed out, especially seniors on fixed income.

1205
01:44:31,961 --> 01:44:34,022
or zero income for the last 29 years.

1206
01:44:35,622 --> 01:44:38,043
Just wanted to volunteer a story from my childhood.

1207
01:44:38,443 --> 01:44:38,784
Thank you.

1208
01:44:39,064 --> 01:44:39,524
You're welcome.

1209
01:44:39,664 --> 01:44:41,245
And I saw you were probably here the other day.

1210
01:44:42,945 --> 01:44:43,845
Councilor Lingo-Kern.

1211
01:44:44,206 --> 01:44:45,846
Thank you, President Carvio.

1212
01:44:45,866 --> 01:44:55,090
I'd like to move approval as amended, striking 24 and added, um, 18 month demo delay if that's what the council so chooses and move for approval.

1213
01:44:55,190 --> 01:44:56,850
Roll call vote is requested.

1214
01:44:56,930 --> 01:44:58,411
Seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

1215
01:44:59,312 --> 01:45:06,198
And this will take its first reading this evening where it is a note in exchange.

1216
01:45:08,039 --> 01:45:11,802
Council marks procedurally.

1217
01:45:11,862 --> 01:45:17,707
Should we take the paper that's before the committee of the whole and a reported out of committee of the whole?

1218
01:45:17,727 --> 01:45:21,410
I mean, it's, it's a paper of similar subject matter.

1219
01:45:23,930 --> 01:45:30,676
Also nice, the council rules state that paper that met in subcommittee cannot be reported out of subcommittee until the committee of the whole meets and it's presented.

1220
01:45:30,876 --> 01:45:36,822
So that paper would have to be presented to the committee of the whole in order to be reported out of the committee of the whole and reach the floor pursuant to our rules.

1221
01:45:37,503 --> 01:45:40,305
But we have Councilor Lungo's paper that's in front of us that we can amend.

1222
01:45:40,565 --> 01:45:44,649
That was the theory that I was going with when I made the amendment to the piece of paper.

1223
01:45:44,989 --> 01:45:46,070
Final information, Mr. President.

1224
01:45:50,044 --> 01:46:06,499
My assent to the paper before us was under the impression that it was a amendation of the original paper that was in subcommittee as presented and refined by Council and presented to us at the sidebar tonight.

1225
01:46:09,371 --> 01:46:17,158
which then I hope has taken over the substance in form of the resolution 17-371.

1226
01:46:17,539 --> 01:46:18,360
Thank you.

1227
01:46:18,400 --> 01:46:18,740
Okay.

1228
01:46:18,840 --> 01:46:23,785
Councilor Marks?

1229
01:46:23,965 --> 01:46:25,446
If the council's fine with that.

1230
01:46:25,466 --> 01:46:25,887
Okay.

1231
01:46:29,310 --> 01:46:32,934
Mr. Clerk, if you'd like to read the, read it back so everybody understands what they're voting on.

1232
01:46:35,182 --> 01:46:39,803
put his mic on, put his mic on.

1233
01:46:42,704 --> 01:46:43,084
Okay.

1234
01:46:43,264 --> 01:46:44,725
Um, okay.

1235
01:46:44,745 --> 01:46:52,787
So the city of Medford revised ordinance, uh, article for section 48 be amended as follows.

1236
01:46:54,148 --> 01:47:02,430
Uh, section seven, section 77 definitions, uh, and the significant building,

1237
01:47:04,983 --> 01:47:22,429
section, subsection three, we're going to strike before 1900 and replace within, replace with, within previous 75 years.

1238
01:47:22,489 --> 01:47:23,069
Within 75 years?

1239
01:47:27,651 --> 01:47:29,511
That's what I have.

1240
01:47:35,231 --> 01:47:36,272
It should be 75 years or older.

1241
01:47:36,732 --> 01:47:37,292
Right, correct.

1242
01:47:37,392 --> 01:47:37,653
Right?

1243
01:47:37,713 --> 01:47:39,234
Thank you.

1244
01:47:39,254 --> 01:47:39,854
75 years or older.

1245
01:47:39,974 --> 01:47:42,035
If it says within, that means within now to 75 years.

1246
01:47:42,055 --> 01:47:42,215
Correct.

1247
01:47:42,235 --> 01:47:42,956
Yeah, you're right.

1248
01:47:42,976 --> 01:47:46,938
So it would just be 75 years or older, correct?

1249
01:47:46,958 --> 01:47:47,339
75 years or older.

1250
01:47:47,359 --> 01:47:48,640
75 years or older.

1251
01:48:05,690 --> 01:48:11,693
Thank you.

1252
01:48:18,616 --> 01:48:26,339
Section 48 78 H. I'm going to strike.

1253
01:48:27,340 --> 01:48:29,241
Until at least six.

1254
01:48:30,922 --> 01:48:31,742
Replace it with.

1255
01:48:32,717 --> 01:48:34,918
until at least 18, that's 18 months.

1256
01:48:34,938 --> 01:48:41,201
Section 48-78I2, strike at least 6, replace with at least 18, 18 months.

1257
01:48:41,241 --> 01:48:42,441
We're going to add a new section.

1258
01:49:02,556 --> 01:49:02,756
Okay.

1259
01:49:02,916 --> 01:49:03,197
That's it.

1260
01:49:03,617 --> 01:49:04,017
That's it.

1261
01:49:05,318 --> 01:49:09,302
And does this require a, this requires a three reading, correct?

1262
01:49:09,822 --> 01:49:10,823
We have to take three readings.

1263
01:49:10,863 --> 01:49:10,943
Yeah.

1264
01:49:10,963 --> 01:49:11,544
All right.

1265
01:49:11,664 --> 01:49:16,648
On the motion by council, I'm going to occur as amended.

1266
01:49:16,768 --> 01:49:18,369
Seconded by councilor Della Russo.

1267
01:49:18,570 --> 01:49:20,131
This is for the first roll call vote.

1268
01:49:20,471 --> 01:49:21,312
Is this for the first reading?

1269
01:49:21,412 --> 01:49:25,035
So for the first reading, Mr. Clark, please call the roll.

1270
01:49:27,337 --> 01:49:28,258
Councilor Della Russo.

1271
01:49:28,538 --> 01:49:28,838
Yes.

1272
01:49:29,799 --> 01:49:30,560
Councilor Falco.

1273
01:49:30,620 --> 01:49:30,820
Yes.

1274
01:49:31,581 --> 01:49:32,101
Councilor Knight?

1275
01:49:32,301 --> 01:49:32,541
Yes.

1276
01:49:33,522 --> 01:49:34,242
Councilor Langel-Kern?

1277
01:49:34,262 --> 01:49:34,382
Yes.

1278
01:49:35,042 --> 01:49:35,783
Vice President Marks?

1279
01:49:35,923 --> 01:49:36,103
Yes.

1280
01:49:36,643 --> 01:49:37,443
Councilor Scott Pelli?

1281
01:49:37,523 --> 01:49:37,763
Yes.

1282
01:49:38,444 --> 01:49:39,224
President Caviello?

1283
01:49:39,344 --> 01:49:39,584
Yes.

1284
01:49:40,524 --> 01:49:43,306
Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

1285
01:49:43,646 --> 01:49:47,667
Motion passes, and it takes its first reading this evening.

1286
01:49:48,087 --> 01:49:53,890
Thank you all my councilors for deliberating and talking this evening and getting this done.

1287
01:49:55,750 --> 01:49:59,572
Motion by Councilor Langel-Kern to revert back to regular business.

1288
01:50:03,926 --> 01:50:05,747
Seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

1289
01:50:05,847 --> 01:50:09,009
All those in favor.

1290
01:50:09,109 --> 01:50:09,329
Aye.

1291
01:50:09,349 --> 01:50:11,871
17-366 offered by Vice President Mox.

1292
01:50:12,491 --> 01:50:18,475
Be it resolved that the citywide street sweeping program be discussed.

1293
01:50:19,515 --> 01:50:20,276
Councilor Mox.

1294
01:50:21,757 --> 01:50:23,318
Thank you, Mr. President.

1295
01:50:24,058 --> 01:50:25,259
We're in the midst of

1296
01:50:27,160 --> 01:50:29,944
uh, street sweeping, citywide street sweeping.

1297
01:50:30,825 --> 01:50:38,674
And as I've mentioned in the past, Mr. President, it's uh, maybe if we could have a recess until everyone leaves, Mr. President.

1298
01:50:38,694 --> 01:50:42,018
If we could have a two minute recess until the room clears out.

1299
01:57:05,903 --> 01:57:07,424
Ladies and gentlemen in the back, we're ready to go.

1300
01:57:08,405 --> 01:57:08,805
Thank you.

1301
01:57:08,825 --> 01:57:15,030
The motion by Councilor DelaRusso to revert back to regular business.

1302
01:57:17,713 --> 01:57:20,135
Motion by Councilor DelaRusso to suspend the rules.

1303
01:57:20,847 --> 01:57:25,108
The purpose of taking 17374 from the table, Mr. President.

1304
01:57:25,388 --> 01:57:26,488
He was already in the midst of his.

1305
01:57:27,348 --> 01:57:30,769
My sincerest apologies, then I rescind my request.

1306
01:57:30,809 --> 01:57:31,169
Thank you.

1307
01:57:31,769 --> 01:57:34,670
And ask that the chairman reconvene the meeting.

1308
01:57:34,830 --> 01:57:35,250
Thank you.

1309
01:57:36,951 --> 01:57:38,651
The chairman will reconvene the meeting now.

1310
01:57:39,271 --> 01:57:42,032
And Councilor Marks has the floor.

1311
01:57:42,072 --> 01:57:42,672
Thank you, Mr. President.

1312
01:57:44,536 --> 01:57:45,537
Thank you, Mr. President.

1313
01:57:46,538 --> 01:57:53,565
As I mentioned earlier, we are in the midst of a street-sweeping initiative that's going on currently right now.

1314
01:57:54,346 --> 01:58:06,018
And it has been stated in the past by myself and many members of this council that this particular program that we have right now is just a shell of a program.

1315
01:58:06,635 --> 01:58:10,282
And it's existed that way for a number of years, Mr. President.

1316
01:58:10,702 --> 01:58:18,837
And the reason why I bring this up is the fact that right now, in my opinion, the city is not giving proper notification to residents.

1317
01:58:19,562 --> 01:58:21,764
regarding when street sweeping will take place.

1318
01:58:22,745 --> 01:58:39,277
I've recommended in the past, and we'll do so again tonight, that the city embark upon creating permanent signage indicating the date and time of sweeping on every road in the city, Mr. President, which provides residents with notification.

1319
01:58:39,818 --> 01:58:49,045
It allows residents to know of a recurring patent of when streets will be swept, and it allows residents to plan ahead

1320
01:58:49,640 --> 01:58:50,401
Mr. President.

1321
01:58:50,962 --> 01:58:57,189
So permanent signage will accomplish the notification and the planning ahead of residents.

1322
01:58:57,773 --> 01:59:20,243
Also, Mr. President, as I've offered in the past, staggering parking on streets, whether it's odd or even parking during street sweeping, allows residents in those areas that are congested to, that don't have access to a driveway or to put their car somewhere, it'll allow them to park on one side of the street, similar to what we do in snow emergencies.

1323
01:59:21,303 --> 01:59:27,446
And then we can sweep on one side and then on the other side, Mr. President, allowing residents

1324
01:59:28,221 --> 01:59:30,432
ample opportunity to park their cars.

1325
01:59:31,510 --> 01:59:32,951
on either the odd or even side.

1326
01:59:33,351 --> 01:59:45,395
I would ask that this recommendation or these recommendations be sent to the Public Works Subcommittee for full recommendations on the creation of a street sweeping program.

1327
01:59:45,875 --> 01:59:55,898
This is not the first time I've asked that we take a long and hard look at how we operate and do business in this community, in particular regarding street sweeping.

1328
01:59:56,299 --> 02:00:00,060
The fact we only sweep our streets twice a year

1329
02:00:01,300 --> 02:00:03,841
You know, street sweeping accomplishes a number of things.

1330
02:00:04,301 --> 02:00:14,783
It keeps our roads clean, but it also keeps the debris and clutter from going into our catch basins, which create flooding if they get filled up, Mr. President.

1331
02:00:15,124 --> 02:00:26,106
So this is a very important initiative that, for some reason, this city has been lax on creating an effective policy of notification and permanent signage.

1332
02:00:26,846 --> 02:00:29,167
And I think it's long overdue, Mr. President,

1333
02:00:29,762 --> 02:00:42,346
If need be, if the city administration feels to act upon these recommendations like they've done in the past, I would recommend that the city council, and in particular the public works committee, create a city ordinance.

1334
02:00:43,207 --> 02:00:50,969
Because it seems to me that the policy of street sweeping, which is created by the administration, is no longer effective in this community.

1335
02:00:51,369 --> 02:00:59,252
When you see cars that are being tagged and towed, you know, and many of which do not receive

1336
02:00:59,672 --> 02:01:01,493
the notification from the reverse 9-1-1.

1337
02:01:01,573 --> 02:01:16,862
I think it's a shame, Mr. President, in this day and age, to hit residents up with a $175 bill before they even start their day off, if they're able to start their day off after their car gets towed.

1338
02:01:18,263 --> 02:01:28,969
So I would offer that in the form of a motion, Mr. President, that this be sent to the Public Works Subcommittee to review permanent signage with dates and times and a recurring

1339
02:01:30,368 --> 02:01:42,034
on when our streets will be swept and also to stagger the parking by odd even allowing residents in congested areas to park on the streets during street sweeping.

1340
02:01:42,234 --> 02:01:43,034
Thank you Mr. Vice President.

1341
02:01:43,054 --> 02:01:51,518
The Public Works Subcommittee is headed by Councilor Nyth, Vice President Mox, and Councilor DelaRusso.

1342
02:01:55,140 --> 02:01:55,460
Thank you.

1343
02:01:56,936 --> 02:01:58,237
Councilor Scarpelli.

1344
02:01:58,317 --> 02:01:59,138
Thank you, Mr. President.

1345
02:01:59,178 --> 02:02:00,740
Thank my colleague for bringing this forward.

1346
02:02:01,481 --> 02:02:13,073
Just for clarity, Council Marks, we're looking to put an eight to ten month program like neighbor communities have, a street sweeping program that runs daily.

1347
02:02:20,716 --> 02:02:21,557
Thank you, Mr. President.

1348
02:02:21,917 --> 02:02:23,538
Counsel Scott probably brings up a great point.

1349
02:02:24,119 --> 02:02:27,821
I would envision something starting in April, ending the end of December.

1350
02:02:28,542 --> 02:02:40,410
Uh, I know our business districts probably should be swept probably on a daily basis, maybe the neighborhoods, uh, streets once a month based on the permanent signage, uh, giving dates and times and so forth.

1351
02:02:40,791 --> 02:02:48,216
And maybe, uh, you know, staggering odd even, but, uh, definitely at least once a month from April to December in the neighborhoods.

1352
02:02:48,556 --> 02:02:48,977
Okay.

1353
02:02:49,137 --> 02:02:49,517
If I could,

1354
02:02:50,011 --> 02:03:13,818
If I could, if you could allow me to make amendment to that paper and looking to ask the city administration for feasibility study, whether it's outsourcing or with hopes to provide what I would hope our DPW with the crew and machinery needed to perform that such act on that type of a basis.

1355
02:03:13,838 --> 02:03:18,620
So I'd love to see more in depth numbers and

1356
02:03:19,278 --> 02:03:21,660
It's something that I would love to see in our community.

1357
02:03:21,680 --> 02:03:22,681
So thank you.

1358
02:03:23,242 --> 02:03:24,783
Thank you, Councillor Scarpelli.

1359
02:03:25,404 --> 02:03:26,184
Councillor Falco.

1360
02:03:26,425 --> 02:03:27,205
Thank you, Mr. President.

1361
02:03:27,225 --> 02:03:28,987
I want to thank Councillor Lamox for bringing this forward.

1362
02:03:29,047 --> 02:03:31,049
I think this is a great resolution.

1363
02:03:31,069 --> 02:03:32,891
I think it's something that needs to be looked at.

1364
02:03:34,072 --> 02:03:38,255
I know that I've received many phone calls when I bump into people in the streets.

1365
02:03:38,295 --> 02:03:42,519
A lot of people will talk about the cleanliness of the roads in the city.

1366
02:03:43,160 --> 02:03:45,362
And this is something that needs to be addressed.

1367
02:03:46,093 --> 02:03:48,335
But I, you know, Council Member Akshay, you bring up a good point.

1368
02:03:48,415 --> 02:03:51,297
I think that this is something that should probably be in a city ordinance.

1369
02:03:51,837 --> 02:03:58,962
I mean, this does, I think, hold the city's feet to the fire and says, hey, you know what, this needs to be done X amount of times a year.

1370
02:03:59,002 --> 02:04:02,144
I mean, two times a year right now to me is just not acceptable.

1371
02:04:02,664 --> 02:04:04,225
I mean, people pay their taxes here.

1372
02:04:04,565 --> 02:04:07,207
They deserve to have clean streets and a clean city.

1373
02:04:07,647 --> 02:04:13,611
And I think right now, you know, you go, you drive down many of the streets and, you know, there's debris all over the place, you know, with regard to, you know,

1374
02:04:14,098 --> 02:04:18,660
you know, rocks from the road being torn up after the winter.

1375
02:04:19,301 --> 02:04:25,064
And, you know, I mean, basically these things need to be addressed.

1376
02:04:25,724 --> 02:04:27,465
And it wasn't even a bad winter.

1377
02:04:27,525 --> 02:04:31,387
So, you know, when you have a really bad winter, the street can be a real mess.

1378
02:04:31,427 --> 02:04:38,411
So, I mean, I think I definitely would favor this, would favor this to be in a city ordinance.

1379
02:04:39,051 --> 02:04:41,372
I think that's the way we need to go long-term.

1380
02:04:41,492 --> 02:04:42,633
If it's going to go to the

1381
02:04:43,127 --> 02:04:44,468
uh, DPW subcommittee.

1382
02:04:44,688 --> 02:04:52,010
I think that's fine, but I think we need to also look at this, uh, um, you know, on the, uh, ordered in subcommittee as well.

1383
02:04:52,311 --> 02:04:52,611
Thank you.

1384
02:04:52,631 --> 02:04:53,371
Councilor Falco.

1385
02:04:53,811 --> 02:04:54,411
Councilor Knight.

1386
02:04:54,912 --> 02:04:56,132
Mr. President, thank you very much.

1387
02:04:56,152 --> 02:05:00,534
This is a topic that's not new to anybody behind this rail, um, especially during this time of year.

1388
02:05:01,134 --> 02:05:07,496
And, um, one of the items that I see in terms of street sweeping in general, that's lacking in the community is, um, our public utilities.

1389
02:05:07,797 --> 02:05:11,458
And when we issue permits to our public utilities to tear up our streets and they do it,

1390
02:05:12,102 --> 02:05:15,226
And then they decide to come back whenever they feel like coming back to repair our streets.

1391
02:05:15,786 --> 02:05:21,232
And then they leave the streets still looking in an awful situation, an awful mess with sand, with gravel, with dirt all over the place.

1392
02:05:22,634 --> 02:05:29,241
I don't believe that public utilities are required as part of the permitting process when they open up our streets to perform a sweep when they're done.

1393
02:05:29,782 --> 02:05:31,704
And I think that that's something that we should also look at.

1394
02:05:31,724 --> 02:05:33,666
Mr. President, I'd like to amend the paper to reflect that.

1395
02:05:34,780 --> 02:05:45,325
I'd also, as the chairman of the DPW subcommittee, would request that any of my colleagues behind this rail send out an email to the members of the subcommittee with any suggestions that they'd like to see, and we can get to the table and discuss these issues.

1396
02:05:46,025 --> 02:05:46,946
Thank you, Councilor Night.

1397
02:05:48,106 --> 02:05:49,006
Councilor Dela Russo.

1398
02:05:49,647 --> 02:05:54,429
Mr. President, I am grateful to have this opportunity to work on this in a concrete way.

1399
02:05:54,969 --> 02:05:59,211
I know the subcommittee will get things done, certainly under the leadership of Councilor Night.

1400
02:06:00,031 --> 02:06:03,913
I would like to point out, though, that I think it is fairly

1401
02:06:04,498 --> 02:06:19,289
almost nightly, maybe every other night, I should say at four in the morning, as I am awakened every time it happens at four in the morning by our dear friends from the Street Sweeper who come by as I live adjacent to a business district.

1402
02:06:20,810 --> 02:06:29,077
I have the beautiful sound of the humming of the engine, the whining of the transmission, and the scuffing of the

1403
02:06:29,734 --> 02:06:31,796
the brushes that get our streets clean.

1404
02:06:33,017 --> 02:06:35,660
Many of the main streets are done on a daily basis.

1405
02:06:35,720 --> 02:06:35,961
Yes.

1406
02:06:37,102 --> 02:06:42,207
So we can continue to work on this and I think the idea of an ordinance is a good idea.

1407
02:06:42,227 --> 02:06:44,149
I think it's a good idea.

1408
02:06:47,032 --> 02:06:48,294
Name and address for the record please.

1409
02:06:48,833 --> 02:06:49,954
Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez.

1410
02:06:50,014 --> 02:06:51,315
I live at 281 Park Street.

1411
02:06:51,455 --> 02:06:53,737
My street is designated as a main artery.

1412
02:06:54,458 --> 02:07:01,484
So I think we have the street cleaning is supposed to commence in April and begin end on October 30th.

1413
02:07:02,805 --> 02:07:09,050
I hope that part of the discussion will include the main arteries because what we really need on those arteries is enforcement.

1414
02:07:09,271 --> 02:07:11,933
I like Councillor Dela Rousseau get the

1415
02:07:12,565 --> 02:07:13,426
One to two a.m.

1416
02:07:13,466 --> 02:07:16,928
Wake up call now twice a week for the street cleaners coming in the middle of the night.

1417
02:07:17,508 --> 02:07:24,292
But I often look out the window and note that even though one night is odd and one night is even, the street cleaner has to go around a car.

1418
02:07:24,372 --> 02:07:27,254
So if there's no enforcement, then those roads aren't actually getting cleaned.

1419
02:07:27,794 --> 02:07:31,677
And my husband will go out the next day with the shovel and pick up the debris on the road.

1420
02:07:32,417 --> 02:07:37,221
broken glass and such, that hasn't been picked up by the street cleaner because someone is parked in front of our house.

1421
02:07:37,861 --> 02:07:39,642
So that's important as well.

1422
02:07:39,762 --> 02:07:50,390
Also, when you do the clean sweep in the fall, because street cleaning on the main arteries has ended, we don't get street cleaning after October 30th, so all the leaves are in the streets.

1423
02:07:50,730 --> 02:07:52,871
And the neighbors will go out and take care of those as well.

1424
02:07:53,512 --> 02:07:57,134
So if we're not going to have enforcement, then increased street cleaning is not going to work.

1425
02:07:57,194 --> 02:08:01,837
I know that the police are taxed, but that should be something that is included in the conversation.

1426
02:08:01,917 --> 02:08:11,262
Because even though we have the signs on our street every 10 to 20 feet, there's a sign that says move on Wednesday night, move on Thursday night, the cars are not moving and nothing's happening.

1427
02:08:11,322 --> 02:08:12,823
The street cleaners are just going around them.

1428
02:08:13,423 --> 02:08:15,885
So that's not really useful for us.

1429
02:08:16,265 --> 02:08:17,966
I do hope that it will do more street cleaning.

1430
02:08:18,146 --> 02:08:19,547
My father lives on Garfield Avenue.

1431
02:08:19,908 --> 02:08:23,470
and he's frequently cleaning out the catch basins because they don't get the regular cleaning.

1432
02:08:23,910 --> 02:08:24,371
Thank you.

1433
02:08:26,112 --> 02:08:41,601
On the motion by councilor marks as amended by councilor night, seconded by, and as amended by councilor Scott Pelly, seconded by councilor Longo Kern.

1434
02:08:44,722 --> 02:08:49,245
And this, uh, to send this to these public,

1435
02:08:49,921 --> 02:08:52,923
public works, a subcommittee, all those in favor.

1436
02:08:54,003 --> 02:08:54,824
Motion passes.

1437
02:08:56,004 --> 02:08:56,805
Thank you very much.

1438
02:08:57,505 --> 02:08:58,586
Motion to spend the rules.

1439
02:08:59,186 --> 02:09:04,068
So we, so we can, um, have Roberta Cameron come up.

1440
02:09:04,088 --> 02:09:10,932
Uh, I know she was a little bit late, uh, to be speaking on the community preservation act.

1441
02:09:11,292 --> 02:09:11,932
All those in favor.

1442
02:09:13,233 --> 02:09:13,533
Thank you.

1443
02:09:14,394 --> 02:09:14,494
Yes.

1444
02:09:18,676 --> 02:09:19,337
Thank you very much.

1445
02:09:19,357 --> 02:09:20,498
Name and address of the record, please.

1446
02:09:20,618 --> 02:09:22,520
Roberta Cameron, 12 North Street.

1447
02:09:23,180 --> 02:09:24,061
My apologies.

1448
02:09:24,121 --> 02:09:27,084
I was double booked tonight and I didn't realize how late they would keep me.

1449
02:09:29,006 --> 02:09:43,820
Um, so, um, I, I think you all know me, uh, my familiarity with community preservation and I sincerely look forward to having the opportunity to help the city of Medford build this, um,

1450
02:09:44,742 --> 02:09:55,629
this program with the Community Preservation Act and see and understand what our needs are and how we can use these resources to carry out our community goals.

1451
02:09:57,490 --> 02:09:57,790
Thank you.

1452
02:09:58,090 --> 02:09:58,411
Thank you.

1453
02:09:59,932 --> 02:10:00,992
Councillor Neistat.

1454
02:10:01,012 --> 02:10:02,333
Mr. President, thank you very much.

1455
02:10:02,773 --> 02:10:14,161
I first met Roberta when she asked me for a signature on the Preserve Medford petition and since that time I've had the opportunity to work with her through the passage of the Act and now the passage of the

1456
02:10:14,965 --> 02:10:16,185
community preservation commission.

1457
02:10:16,645 --> 02:10:21,326
Um, she was a member of the ad hoc subcommittee, um, that put together the language for our city ordinance.

1458
02:10:21,767 --> 02:10:30,048
And, um, if we take a look at miss Cameron's resume and credentials and contrast that with the city ordinance, you'll see that, uh, she meets all the criteria that has been outlined.

1459
02:10:30,549 --> 02:10:37,190
Um, she has a great wealth of experience and technical assistance and, uh, implementing the community preservation act and other communities.

1460
02:10:37,690 --> 02:10:41,331
And, uh, it was really a pleasure working with her and other members of the committee to get this thing passed.

1461
02:10:42,175 --> 02:10:48,137
And this is really the final step that the City Council has this evening, Mr. President, in our involvement with the creation of the ordinance.

1462
02:10:49,337 --> 02:10:51,358
We appoint the last member of the committee.

1463
02:10:51,378 --> 02:11:00,720
Hopefully she gets approved this evening and they get to work on putting proposals together to give to us to decide whether or not they're things that we feel as though should be funded.

1464
02:11:01,281 --> 02:11:09,343
So with that being said, it's with great pleasure that I wholeheartedly endorse Roberta's candidacy and move for approval on the paper number one.

1465
02:11:09,697 --> 02:11:15,902
And number two, it's with great excitement that I'm glad to see the commission finally together, up, and hopefully soon to be running.

1466
02:11:16,583 --> 02:11:19,005
I would like to point out your colleagues waited as long as they could for you.

1467
02:11:19,765 --> 02:11:21,627
And I'm on the committee and they had to leave.

1468
02:11:22,207 --> 02:11:26,491
But I will, for one, Mr. President, have no problem supporting Roberta Cameron for an appointment this evening.

1469
02:11:27,011 --> 02:11:27,371
Thank you.

1470
02:11:28,112 --> 02:11:29,013
Counselor De La Rosa.

1471
02:11:29,033 --> 02:11:33,396
Mr. President, I, too, endorse the candidacy of Roberta.

1472
02:11:34,437 --> 02:11:36,759
I laud her for her leadership in this matter.

1473
02:11:37,587 --> 02:11:40,008
and her commitment to our community and other matters.

1474
02:11:40,808 --> 02:11:50,651
And I also particularly point out her patience and willingness to work with people who might not see things the way that she does.

1475
02:11:51,352 --> 02:11:56,253
And she's offered great leadership, and I'd like to second her approval.

1476
02:11:57,554 --> 02:11:57,794
Thank you.

1477
02:11:57,814 --> 02:11:58,234
Councilor Falco.

1478
02:11:58,514 --> 02:11:59,254
Thank you, Mr. President.

1479
02:11:59,274 --> 02:12:02,816
I just wanted to also endorse Roberta Cameron tonight.

1480
02:12:03,856 --> 02:12:05,937
I was on the ad hoc subcommittee with Roberta.

1481
02:12:06,317 --> 02:12:07,097
She was absolutely

1482
02:12:07,490 --> 02:12:09,252
instrumental in developing the ordinance.

1483
02:12:09,712 --> 02:12:10,493
I know you're a hard worker.

1484
02:12:10,513 --> 02:12:11,614
I know you're going to do a great job.

1485
02:12:11,654 --> 02:12:12,515
I just want to say good luck.

1486
02:12:12,616 --> 02:12:13,096
Thank you.

1487
02:12:14,477 --> 02:12:15,198
Councillor Maxx.

1488
02:12:16,259 --> 02:12:17,301
Thank you, Mr. President.

1489
02:12:17,941 --> 02:12:20,184
As Roberta mentioned she's well known in the community.

1490
02:12:21,105 --> 02:12:27,952
Roberta has been an advocate for a lot of different issues in particular our shade trees and our trees throughout the community.

1491
02:12:28,618 --> 02:12:30,899
Roberta has been a real strong advocate.

1492
02:12:31,620 --> 02:12:38,904
And, you know, based on the makeup of this committee, we have a project manager.

1493
02:12:38,984 --> 02:12:41,265
We have someone that works in real estate.

1494
02:12:41,606 --> 02:12:45,468
We have someone that has a particular interest in historic preservation.

1495
02:12:46,108 --> 02:12:51,531
And with Roberta's credentials, this is going to be a very dynamic committee.

1496
02:12:51,751 --> 02:12:55,313
And I look forward to their eventual recommendations, Mr. President.

1497
02:12:55,874 --> 02:12:56,894
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

1498
02:12:57,154 --> 02:12:58,015
Counsel Lungo Kern.

1499
02:12:58,787 --> 02:13:00,187
Thank you, President Caviello.

1500
02:13:00,207 --> 02:13:02,548
I just want to echo the sentiments of my colleagues.

1501
02:13:02,608 --> 02:13:07,170
I've known Roberta for a long time, and she's pushed for a lot of good things in this city.

1502
02:13:07,230 --> 02:13:08,530
And I know she's going to do a great job.

1503
02:13:08,630 --> 02:13:10,191
Thank you for your willingness to serve.

1504
02:13:10,991 --> 02:13:12,212
I think it's just important.

1505
02:13:12,692 --> 02:13:17,273
I pushed my button because I think it was important to point out, I think Council Marks did, and your background.

1506
02:13:17,293 --> 02:13:22,515
You have a planning background, which is extremely important and going to be instrumental on this committee.

1507
02:13:23,255 --> 02:13:25,116
I did ask the other committee members

1508
02:13:25,872 --> 02:13:32,173
could just keep us in the loop and obviously maybe forward us minutes of meetings, just so we know what's going on and what's coming down the line.

1509
02:13:32,213 --> 02:13:33,094
That would be appreciated.

1510
02:13:34,474 --> 02:13:34,854
Thank you.

1511
02:13:35,654 --> 02:13:36,354
Councilor Scarpelli.

1512
02:13:36,875 --> 02:13:38,535
Again, I'm sure I apologize.

1513
02:13:38,555 --> 02:13:45,257
I had to step out for a moment, but I know how tenacious Roberta was to have this issue come to fruition.

1514
02:13:45,317 --> 02:13:54,559
And with your background and your expertise, I know how vital you were as we put the program in place.

1515
02:13:56,138 --> 02:14:04,840
I echo my colleague's comments and very excited to see you as part of this program to see where we can, where we're going to go with this great initiative.

1516
02:14:04,860 --> 02:14:05,360
So thank you.

1517
02:14:05,820 --> 02:14:06,181
Thank you.

1518
02:14:08,421 --> 02:14:08,781
Thank you.

1519
02:14:08,921 --> 02:14:13,882
And I too wanted to thank Roberta for being upfront on many issues in this community.

1520
02:14:14,703 --> 02:14:18,524
And thank you for your, all the work you do here.

1521
02:14:19,684 --> 02:14:22,905
On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Dela Russo,

1522
02:14:25,491 --> 02:14:25,971
Oh, I'm sorry.

1523
02:14:27,572 --> 02:14:27,892
I'm sorry.

1524
02:14:27,912 --> 02:14:29,252
I had the gentleman back.

1525
02:14:29,272 --> 02:14:29,892
Would you like to speak?

1526
02:14:31,773 --> 02:14:32,573
Name, address of the record.

1527
02:14:32,733 --> 02:14:33,693
Thank you, Mr. President.

1528
02:14:33,973 --> 02:14:35,834
Robert Capucci, 71 Evans street.

1529
02:14:36,514 --> 02:14:42,735
Uh, if I could through the chair, I understand this is, she's part of the community preservation.

1530
02:14:42,755 --> 02:14:43,795
We are, we are a commission.

1531
02:14:43,936 --> 02:14:46,516
We are approving her coronation by the, by yes.

1532
02:14:46,716 --> 02:14:49,097
Uh, in, in vetting her out.

1533
02:14:49,497 --> 02:14:49,837
That's right.

1534
02:14:50,227 --> 02:14:55,449
I think it would be prudent to ask the question exactly how does this commission work?

1535
02:14:55,529 --> 02:15:09,596
From my understanding in reading the law is that they get to decide how the funds are spent, but people from the citizenry can also solicit the community preservation commission for funds.

1536
02:15:09,676 --> 02:15:10,436
Point of information.

1537
02:15:10,496 --> 02:15:11,937
Councilor Knight, you will help me.

1538
02:15:12,017 --> 02:15:16,499
The city's ordinance is rather specific in detail in terms of the procedure and the processes.

1539
02:15:17,164 --> 02:15:22,848
that take place on how an applicant can move forward and request whether or not they have a funding opportunity.

1540
02:15:22,868 --> 02:15:26,450
And there are also certain restrictions that are placed around who would be a qualified and eligible applicant.

1541
02:15:26,770 --> 02:15:27,070
Thank you.

1542
02:15:27,170 --> 02:15:27,691
Thank you very much.

1543
02:15:28,171 --> 02:15:30,472
And I'm sure Roberta is very open to anything.

1544
02:15:31,093 --> 02:15:34,475
If you have an idea, give her a call and she'd be happy to listen.

1545
02:15:35,115 --> 02:15:35,656
On the motion.

1546
02:15:38,698 --> 02:15:41,079
On the motion by Councillor Nye, seconded by Councillor De La Russa.

1547
02:15:41,139 --> 02:15:41,740
All those in favour?

1548
02:15:41,760 --> 02:15:42,820
Aye.

1549
02:15:42,840 --> 02:15:43,701
Roberta, thank you very much.

1550
02:15:49,697 --> 02:15:50,858
Yes, Councilor Dela Ruzzo.

1551
02:15:50,878 --> 02:16:09,352
Mr. President, while we're on to suspension, I respectfully request that we take out of order paper 17-374, communications from the mayor regarding the expenditure of monies from free cash for the updating of our election equipment.

1552
02:16:09,812 --> 02:16:13,115
On the motion by Councilor Dela Ruzzo to take paper 17-374,

1553
02:16:16,417 --> 02:16:17,017
Out of order.

1554
02:16:17,157 --> 02:16:19,358
Suspension second by counselor knife.

1555
02:16:19,698 --> 02:16:20,318
All in favor.

1556
02:16:20,338 --> 02:16:20,718
Aye.

1557
02:16:21,238 --> 02:16:22,639
Thank you, Mr. President.

1558
02:16:22,799 --> 02:16:43,804
Uh, if I could, uh, speak on your behalf, we met and I appreciate that, uh, to, um, uh, have a presentation from, uh, the city clerk, uh, regarding the condition of, uh, some of our election equipment, uh, and our need to replace it, that the, uh, equipment has become rather old.

1559
02:16:44,565 --> 02:16:46,147
uh, over 20 years old.

1560
02:16:46,728 --> 02:16:55,620
Uh, it's a difficult to find replacement, uh, parts and backup support, uh, for the, uh, machines which were once cutting edge.

1561
02:16:56,922 --> 02:17:00,507
Uh, and now, uh, we're on the verge of, uh, the,

1562
02:17:01,102 --> 02:17:14,486
clerk with approval of this, uh, and the commitment to free cash will, um, uh, assist the process of sending out an RFP and, uh, the purchase and examination of, uh, some options.

1563
02:17:15,066 --> 02:17:21,688
And so, uh, we had a detailed discussion and the, uh, committee of the whole, uh, and it was reported out favorably.

1564
02:17:22,048 --> 02:17:24,049
So I'd like to move approval, Mr. President.

1565
02:17:25,870 --> 02:17:26,230
Thank you.

1566
02:17:26,270 --> 02:17:30,511
On the motion by Councilor Dela Russo seconded by Councilor Knight.

1567
02:17:31,834 --> 02:17:32,795
All those in favor?

1568
02:17:34,416 --> 02:17:35,177
Councillor Marks.

1569
02:17:37,419 --> 02:17:38,420
Thank you, Mr. President.

1570
02:17:38,880 --> 02:17:41,042
I am not opposed to this particular paper.

1571
02:17:41,963 --> 02:17:53,172
I think it's long overdue to have equipment in the Registrar of Voters Office as well on election day that properly reflects the will of the people.

1572
02:17:54,393 --> 02:17:55,955
And I think equipment is needed.

1573
02:17:56,555 --> 02:17:59,818
I do, Mr. President, have to say that

1574
02:18:00,930 --> 02:18:20,142
This council has voted unanimously on at least three different occasions requesting that our brave men and women of the fire department receive the two extractors, which are washing machines on steroids, Mr. President, and two dryers to clean their turnout gear.

1575
02:18:20,783 --> 02:18:27,187
As I mentioned several weeks ago when I made a presentation before this council that it was unanimously supported,

1576
02:18:27,677 --> 02:18:53,136
I requested that the administration look into buying two more washes because currently, right now, many of the brave men and women of our fire department are using turnout gear that is potentially in a fire and contaminates on the turnout gear that's leaching into our firefighters' skins, Mr. President, and could be causing risk of cancer.

1577
02:18:54,947 --> 02:18:56,568
I've asked this on several occasions.

1578
02:18:56,628 --> 02:18:59,290
The administration said that they were looking into grants.

1579
02:18:59,830 --> 02:19:06,214
I did talk to Bill O'Brien, the union president, and he mentioned they are pursuing a grant.

1580
02:19:06,618 --> 02:19:15,402
right now for two washes and two dries that will be located at the firefighter headquarters on Main Street.

1581
02:19:16,682 --> 02:19:19,864
And if the grant comes through, fine, Mr. President.

1582
02:19:20,584 --> 02:19:24,145
There's nothing that precludes this council from allotting $29,700.

1583
02:19:24,245 --> 02:19:35,130
That's what it's going to take to assure our men and women in the fire department have the proper equipment to wash their gear, Mr. President.

1584
02:19:35,410 --> 02:19:37,711
That's all it's going to take, $29,700.

1585
02:19:38,291 --> 02:19:46,193
And if the grant comes through, Mr. President, that grant will pay back the money that was taken out of the free cash.

1586
02:19:46,593 --> 02:20:03,877
So I would respectfully ask, Mr. President, as part of this paper, there'd be a B paper requesting that the mayor appropriate $29,700 to pay for two washing machines, which are two extractors and two dryers, Mr. President.

1587
02:20:04,553 --> 02:20:09,440
for the fire department, which has been unanimously supported by this council.

1588
02:20:10,601 --> 02:20:22,217
So I would ask that as a big paper, as part of this paper, Mr. President may also point out that it was, uh, uh, reported to us that these new

1589
02:20:22,750 --> 02:20:37,717
polling machines, Mr. President, these new election machines, uh, will not be subject to, uh, undue interference from, uh, foreign powers, whether they be Eastern European or Asian or anywhere else.

1590
02:20:38,597 --> 02:20:38,977
Thank you.

1591
02:20:39,057 --> 02:20:39,958
Councilor DelaRusso.

1592
02:20:42,799 --> 02:20:50,723
On the motion by Councilor DelaRusso, as amended by Councilor Max,

1593
02:20:53,395 --> 02:21:02,357
the $29,700 be appropriated from Free Cash for the purpose of two washes and two dryers.

1594
02:21:02,877 --> 02:21:04,137
Name and address for the record, please.

1595
02:21:05,017 --> 02:21:08,158
Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Avenue, Medford, Mass.

1596
02:21:08,278 --> 02:21:09,998
I commend Councilor Marks.

1597
02:21:10,178 --> 02:21:10,558
Excellent.

1598
02:21:10,678 --> 02:21:15,579
I love seeing good, important, tangible items brought to the table.

1599
02:21:16,319 --> 02:21:20,800
Tonight in Georgia, there's an election and four of the machines, four of the machines are down.

1600
02:21:20,820 --> 02:21:21,820
Now the good guy's winning.

1601
02:21:22,394 --> 02:21:24,776
The Democrat, that's my political speech there.

1602
02:21:25,116 --> 02:21:27,498
But he's winning by a huge margin.

1603
02:21:27,558 --> 02:21:29,740
But there's four machines, and that really concerns me.

1604
02:21:29,800 --> 02:21:33,263
So new election machines, yes, we need them.

1605
02:21:33,744 --> 02:21:37,507
I think we need an outside agency to come in

1606
02:21:38,007 --> 02:21:41,808
and look at this, because the citizens don't know what we're doing when we vote.

1607
02:21:42,288 --> 02:21:43,209
We don't know where it goes.

1608
02:21:43,229 --> 02:21:44,229
It can go into the ether.

1609
02:21:44,329 --> 02:21:50,731
So I know there's partisan people here in city government, and we want to make sure that everything's done correctly.

1610
02:21:51,172 --> 02:21:53,872
So there was a lot of questions about the last election.

1611
02:21:54,673 --> 02:21:57,174
The citizens need to know which kind of machines are coming in.

1612
02:21:57,574 --> 02:22:02,035
We need an outside agency looking at them so that every citizen knows that their vote counts.

1613
02:22:02,575 --> 02:22:03,276
Thank you very much.

1614
02:22:03,896 --> 02:22:04,236
Thank you.

1615
02:22:06,337 --> 02:22:06,937
Councillor Nice.

1616
02:22:07,907 --> 02:22:10,188
On that note, Mr. President, I would like to commend the work that Ms.

1617
02:22:10,208 --> 02:22:13,928
Murray, Mr. Lasky, and Mr. Wade do, our elections commissioners.

1618
02:22:13,948 --> 02:22:15,169
I think they're doing a great job.

1619
02:22:15,269 --> 02:22:16,049
It was great to see them.

1620
02:22:16,069 --> 02:22:17,209
They were very good outside board.

1621
02:22:17,349 --> 02:22:19,370
It was great to see them before the council this evening.

1622
02:22:19,410 --> 02:22:23,550
It's something that we haven't seen too much of in the past, the full board coming before us this evening.

1623
02:22:23,610 --> 02:22:25,651
So I'd like to thank them for the work that they do.

1624
02:22:25,691 --> 02:22:27,191
Congratulate them and move approval on the paper.

1625
02:22:27,571 --> 02:22:28,311
Outstanding board.

1626
02:22:29,472 --> 02:22:35,173
On the motion by Councilor Dela Russo, as amended by Councilor Marks,

1627
02:22:36,856 --> 02:22:39,979
seconded by Councilor Knight.

1628
02:22:42,001 --> 02:22:43,402
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1629
02:22:45,825 --> 02:22:46,806
Councilor DelaRosso?

1630
02:22:47,066 --> 02:22:47,466
Yes.

1631
02:22:48,047 --> 02:22:48,768
Councilor Falco?

1632
02:22:48,968 --> 02:22:49,288
Yes.

1633
02:22:49,889 --> 02:22:50,690
Councilor Night?

1634
02:22:50,710 --> 02:22:50,770
Yes.

1635
02:22:51,470 --> 02:22:52,271
Councilor Long-Term?

1636
02:22:52,411 --> 02:22:52,631
Yes.

1637
02:22:53,612 --> 02:22:54,373
Vice President Marks?

1638
02:22:54,553 --> 02:22:54,974
Yes.

1639
02:22:55,815 --> 02:22:56,575
Councilor Scarpelli?

1640
02:22:56,735 --> 02:22:56,976
Yes.

1641
02:22:58,653 --> 02:23:00,934
Yes, seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

1642
02:23:01,414 --> 02:23:02,494
Motion passes.

1643
02:23:02,974 --> 02:23:07,095
Motion by Councilor Donnarusso to revert back to regular business.

1644
02:23:08,255 --> 02:23:09,575
Seconded by Councilor Nights.

1645
02:23:10,335 --> 02:23:13,996
All those in favor?

1646
02:23:14,016 --> 02:23:26,478
17-367, offered by Vice President Mox, be it resolved that the new bimonthly fixed charge, also known as connectivity charge, for Memphis water and sewer rates

1647
02:23:27,603 --> 02:23:29,303
payers be discussed?

1648
02:23:30,063 --> 02:23:31,124
Vice President Marks.

1649
02:23:31,804 --> 02:23:32,824
Thank you, Mr. President.

1650
02:23:33,264 --> 02:23:37,745
I spoke about this issue, I believe it was last week or the week?

1651
02:23:38,145 --> 02:23:38,485
Last week.

1652
02:23:38,505 --> 02:23:38,685
Last week.

1653
02:23:38,705 --> 02:23:39,585
Thank you, Mr. President.

1654
02:23:40,245 --> 02:23:44,886
And this council voted to set up a Committee of the Whole meeting.

1655
02:23:44,906 --> 02:23:45,466
That's correct.

1656
02:23:45,486 --> 02:23:47,667
Which I believe is going to take place May 2nd.

1657
02:23:47,687 --> 02:23:48,207
May 2nd.

1658
02:23:48,527 --> 02:23:49,067
May 2nd.

1659
02:23:49,107 --> 02:23:51,267
And I want to thank you for your quick response on that.

1660
02:23:51,287 --> 02:23:52,227
You're welcome.

1661
02:23:52,347 --> 02:23:55,628
This is a really important issue that's impacting

1662
02:23:56,104 --> 02:24:02,469
every resident in this community that pays a water and sewer bill.

1663
02:24:02,489 --> 02:24:06,072
I received additional information, and that's why I'm bringing it up tonight.

1664
02:24:06,572 --> 02:24:14,078
I received a letter dated November 17, 2015, regarding Meffitt Water and Sewer Commissioners.

1665
02:24:14,979 --> 02:24:24,867
And the letter goes on to state, Mr. President, that the Water and Sewer Commissioners voted to create what they refer to as

1666
02:24:25,410 --> 02:24:29,694
a baseline charge on everyone's water and sewer bill.

1667
02:24:30,495 --> 02:24:36,581
When I read on, Mr. President, they refer to it as, which I referred to it last week, as a connectivity charge.

1668
02:24:37,522 --> 02:24:46,871
And the way I understand it is every resident will receive this additional charge on a bimonthly basis starting in August 1st, 2018.

1669
02:24:50,638 --> 02:25:03,881
And the reason that I got for the implementation of this connectivity charge is that it will pay for infrastructure improvements and other water and sewer necessities.

1670
02:25:04,682 --> 02:25:10,743
We all know right now there's over $8 million in the water and sewer enterprise account in surplus funds.

1671
02:25:11,467 --> 02:25:20,514
And that money, by state law, is earmarked to not only reduce the rate, if need be, but also for infrastructure improvements.

1672
02:25:21,314 --> 02:25:28,800
And it can only be spent on infrastructure improvements or reduction in water and sewer rates.

1673
02:25:28,820 --> 02:25:36,345
And this particular charge, in my opinion, is nothing more than an additional surcharge on the ratepayers of this community.

1674
02:25:36,965 --> 02:25:38,947
And the additional information I did receive

1675
02:25:39,706 --> 02:25:53,593
And I can let my colleagues see it, or I can make a copy for May 2nd, is that they actually went as far as breaking down the additional charge by the size of the water pipe that comes into your house.

1676
02:25:54,670 --> 02:26:02,955
And most people in this community, in the residential areas, have a five-eighths pipe that comes into the house.

1677
02:26:03,535 --> 02:26:12,541
And that additional connectivity charge will be $9.47 bi-monthly, which is six times.

1678
02:26:13,061 --> 02:26:16,063
So it's roughly $60 additional a year.

1679
02:26:16,583 --> 02:26:19,165
It may not sound like a lot, but you know what?

1680
02:26:19,225 --> 02:26:22,947
When you have an $8 million surplus of ratepayer money,

1681
02:26:23,394 --> 02:26:24,305
sitting in an account.

1682
02:26:24,858 --> 02:26:34,924
That's a lot of money to additionally request, Mr. President, and also request it based on the fact that it's for infrastructure improvements.

1683
02:26:35,465 --> 02:26:37,026
And that's the money we're already collecting.

1684
02:26:37,326 --> 02:26:38,727
And we already have a surplus.

1685
02:26:39,187 --> 02:26:42,729
As part of the bill we currently pay right now, it goes to your water.

1686
02:26:43,070 --> 02:26:44,150
It goes to delivery.

1687
02:26:44,451 --> 02:26:45,952
It goes for the maintenance of the pipes.

1688
02:26:46,312 --> 02:26:51,475
It goes for the workers within the city of Meffitt that are in the water and sewer department.

1689
02:26:51,875 --> 02:26:54,137
So that's already built into the rate structure.

1690
02:26:54,517 --> 02:26:59,521
This is an added cost that I am adamantly opposed to, Mr. President.

1691
02:26:59,541 --> 02:27:14,113
I need to say, I find it ironic, Mr. President, that the Water and Sewer Commission would take a vote or be presented with a proposal in November of 2015.

1692
02:27:17,019 --> 02:27:23,362
And then the city administration sit on it, not till last year when we had a mayor race.

1693
02:27:23,382 --> 02:27:24,923
They didn't touch it then.

1694
02:27:26,424 --> 02:27:27,264
Not this year.

1695
02:27:28,545 --> 02:27:32,047
I mean, last year was an off year.

1696
02:27:33,167 --> 02:27:41,692
To not sit on it during the mayor race, which was in 2015, sit on it in 2016, the first term of the new mayor.

1697
02:27:42,192 --> 02:27:43,733
No, didn't want any increases then. 2017.

1698
02:27:46,523 --> 02:27:47,824
New May is up for reelection.

1699
02:27:48,104 --> 02:27:49,204
Let's sit on it again.

1700
02:27:49,224 --> 02:27:52,445
2018 sounds like a great time.

1701
02:27:52,745 --> 02:27:58,007
Let's do it in August of 2018 when everyone's vacationing and not paying attention.

1702
02:27:58,347 --> 02:28:04,850
That sounds like a great time to implement something almost three years after the fact, Mr. President.

1703
02:28:05,510 --> 02:28:11,532
I really would like to hear from the administration to explain why this is being rolled out in August of 2018.

1704
02:28:13,113 --> 02:28:14,433
What's the reasoning behind it?

1705
02:28:15,114 --> 02:28:21,916
Also, Mr. President, you know, I mentioned $60, and people at home may say, ah, $60, that's not too much.

1706
02:28:22,636 --> 02:28:28,958
That's $1.5 million they're going to raise from roughly a $60 surcharge.

1707
02:28:29,558 --> 02:28:33,399
Now, not everyone has a 5-8 pipe coming into their home.

1708
02:28:33,799 --> 02:28:38,421
We have condos associations that may have an inch pipe, a two-inch pipe.

1709
02:28:38,961 --> 02:28:40,462
Their bill will be $75 bimonthly.

1710
02:28:44,682 --> 02:28:50,223
You go up further to some of the larger corporations in our city that may have a six or 10-inch pipe.

1711
02:28:50,804 --> 02:28:56,605
A 10-inch pipe, Mr. President, coming in, that's $1,087 bimonthly.

1712
02:28:57,405 --> 02:29:00,386
That's $6,000 additional charge.

1713
02:29:01,126 --> 02:29:04,167
Now, I don't know what businesses or how many have a 10-inch pipe.

1714
02:29:05,132 --> 02:29:07,974
or a six-inch water pipe, which is $472.

1715
02:29:09,075 --> 02:29:13,538
But all I can tell you, Mr. President, there's nothing worse than a hidden charge.

1716
02:29:13,998 --> 02:29:21,464
You know, we've been paying for the last three or four years a franchise fee to get local access cable.

1717
02:29:22,444 --> 02:29:29,789
Local access cable, Mr. President, we've all been paying, and we haven't received local access cable in almost four years.

1718
02:29:30,930 --> 02:29:33,372
And I stand to be corrected, it may even be longer than that.

1719
02:29:34,820 --> 02:29:39,402
So all these little additional fees that are out there, Mr. President, do add up.

1720
02:29:39,842 --> 02:29:49,726
Do add up to the senior citizens on a fixed income that can't afford an additional penny on their bill, let alone another $60 for a charge, Mr. President.

1721
02:29:49,946 --> 02:29:51,026
They're already charging us.

1722
02:29:51,746 --> 02:29:56,788
You already have $8 million of the taxpayers' money, Mr. President, in an account.

1723
02:29:57,348 --> 02:29:58,369
What more do you want?

1724
02:29:59,149 --> 02:30:00,790
What more do you want from the ratepayers?

1725
02:30:01,690 --> 02:30:02,811
It's easy picking.

1726
02:30:03,191 --> 02:30:03,812
That's what it is.

1727
02:30:03,872 --> 02:30:05,614
It's easy picking, Mr. President.

1728
02:30:06,554 --> 02:30:21,067
So I would ask, Mr. President, that when we meet with the Water and Sewer Commission on May 2nd, that the administration is also represented and also that Ron Baker, which I mentioned, I'm not sure if you added him,

1729
02:30:21,367 --> 02:30:21,907
to the list.

1730
02:30:22,047 --> 02:30:22,867
He's on the list.

1731
02:30:22,907 --> 02:30:23,608
He's on the list.

1732
02:30:23,888 --> 02:30:36,431
So we can have a thorough explanation on, not only from the Water and Sewer Commissioners, from the city administration, who's been sitting on this for several years now, for the opportune time to present it when no one's paying attention.

1733
02:30:36,811 --> 02:30:37,971
That's what this boils down to.

1734
02:30:38,312 --> 02:30:41,692
We can put that question forward so we'll have that information for that meeting.

1735
02:30:41,733 --> 02:30:44,793
I'd like to hear it from the horse's mouth, instead of from the other end.

1736
02:30:45,754 --> 02:30:46,934
I'd like to hear it from the horse's mouth.

1737
02:30:46,974 --> 02:30:48,154
We will invite the administration to the meeting.

1738
02:30:48,734 --> 02:30:50,135
OK, I'd appreciate that, Mr. President.

1739
02:30:50,155 --> 02:30:50,535
Thank you.

1740
02:30:50,635 --> 02:30:50,935
Thank you.

1741
02:30:52,054 --> 02:30:52,855
Councilor Doroso.

1742
02:30:53,375 --> 02:31:10,810
Mr. President, I, too, look forward to hearing more about this from the city administration, members of the Water and Sewer Commission, and the appropriate parties who are able to present to us factual information, which I look forward to.

1743
02:31:11,491 --> 02:31:14,854
And I thank you in advance for your leadership in the matter, Mr. President.

1744
02:31:14,874 --> 02:31:15,975
Thank you, Councilor Doroso.

1745
02:31:16,796 --> 02:31:18,097
Councilor Lococo.

1746
02:31:18,157 --> 02:31:19,698
Thank you, President Caravaggio.

1747
02:31:19,718 --> 02:31:22,159
I just want to thank Councilor Marks for bringing this forward.

1748
02:31:22,239 --> 02:31:24,581
I was unaware.

1749
02:31:24,601 --> 02:31:26,382
I don't know how you got the information.

1750
02:31:26,422 --> 02:31:29,964
If you could provide us with that information, maybe by email before the meeting.

1751
02:31:29,984 --> 02:31:32,505
OK.

1752
02:31:32,986 --> 02:31:38,269
Yeah, I'm just glad it's been brought to our attention before they roll it out.

1753
02:31:38,569 --> 02:31:43,031
Come August 2018, I definitely am in agreement with Councilor Marks.

1754
02:31:43,532 --> 02:31:45,573
We already overtaxed the taxpayer.

1755
02:31:46,105 --> 02:31:50,128
the ratepayers, and now, you know, any additional fees or charges.

1756
02:31:50,929 --> 02:31:52,290
It does hurt a lot of people.

1757
02:31:52,390 --> 02:31:54,892
Some people can afford it, but a lot of people can't.

1758
02:31:54,932 --> 02:31:56,393
And those are the people that we hear from.

1759
02:31:56,413 --> 02:31:57,594
So I'm glad.

1760
02:31:57,734 --> 02:32:00,016
Thank you for setting up a meeting, President Carviello.

1761
02:32:00,096 --> 02:32:05,700
And I look forward to getting some answers and hopefully making some changes to the potential possibility.

1762
02:32:05,720 --> 02:32:07,842
The second council will hold 6 o'clock p.m.

1763
02:32:07,862 --> 02:32:10,084
Name and address of the record, please.

1764
02:32:10,864 --> 02:32:11,905
Thank you, Mr. President.

1765
02:32:12,085 --> 02:32:13,607
Robert Capucci, 71 Evans Street.

1766
02:32:14,827 --> 02:32:19,468
Through the chair, I want to thank Councillor Marks for bringing this up and bringing this information forward.

1767
02:32:20,008 --> 02:32:42,132
Mr. President, on two separate other debating topics tonight, the vetting of the new Community Preservation Commission, a new shadow government method, and on Councillor Lungo-Kern's resolution about the demolition, a lot of talk was generated on affordable housing and preserving historic landmarks.

1768
02:32:42,750 --> 02:32:48,620
here's a great opportunity to give a little bit more affordable housing to the residents of Medford.

1769
02:32:49,195 --> 02:32:59,743
And as far as historical landmarks go, how about our senior citizens, like my mother, who's 78 years old, who is a historic person as far as I'm concerned here in Medford.

1770
02:33:00,083 --> 02:33:11,852
This charge, Mr. President, and I'm a little passionate about this, is outrageous, especially when Councilor Marks refers to the fact that there's $8 million in an overtaxed account.

1771
02:33:12,212 --> 02:33:16,255
Here's a great opportunity to provide a little bit more affordable housing

1772
02:33:16,515 --> 02:33:17,595
to the citizens of Medford.

1773
02:33:17,615 --> 02:33:18,515
And we shouldn't wait until 2018.

1774
02:33:19,055 --> 02:33:24,836
The power of this body should somehow find a way to kill this now, not wait.

1775
02:33:24,917 --> 02:33:26,217
May 2nd will be the Council of All We.

1776
02:33:26,257 --> 02:33:26,797
Not wait.

1777
02:33:27,037 --> 02:33:38,899
And on that point, because this is such an important matter, perhaps that Committee of the Whole meeting should be in this chamber, under the TV, so people at home can watch this, Mr. President.

1778
02:33:39,819 --> 02:33:44,700
It's unfortunate that that meeting is not available to the whole public through

1779
02:33:45,164 --> 02:33:47,706
through technology in some fashion.

1780
02:33:49,547 --> 02:33:53,630
To me, I'm sorry, this is really outrageous.

1781
02:33:54,511 --> 02:33:55,831
Something should be done.

1782
02:33:56,392 --> 02:34:07,740
In terms of talking about affordability for the residents of Medford, another speaker spoke earlier to me about how the rents are going way up.

1783
02:34:08,080 --> 02:34:08,961
Why do you think that is?

1784
02:34:10,170 --> 02:34:19,976
When the property taxes are always going up, our sales taxes, excise taxes, excess in taxes, a cash account with another $10 million into it.

1785
02:34:20,436 --> 02:34:34,765
This stuff trickles downhill, Mr. President, in the lower income, in the middle income, and the poor people are the ones who end up paying all of these excessive costs for living in the city of Medford, especially when there's a surplus.

1786
02:34:35,091 --> 02:34:37,572
Mr. President... May 2nd, voice your concerns that night.

1787
02:34:38,172 --> 02:34:40,033
I'm voicing them here and now, too, Mr. President.

1788
02:34:40,053 --> 02:34:40,433
Thank you.

1789
02:34:40,493 --> 02:34:41,274
It's outrageous.

1790
02:34:41,294 --> 02:34:41,494
Thank you.

1791
02:34:41,514 --> 02:34:42,194
Thank you very much.

1792
02:34:42,214 --> 02:34:44,235
Mr. President.

1793
02:34:44,255 --> 02:34:45,135
Vice President Max.

1794
02:34:46,196 --> 02:34:48,297
Just if I can also amend the paper.

1795
02:34:48,757 --> 02:34:59,902
If we can also, before the May 2nd meeting, get a copy of the minutes which the vote of the Water and Sewer Commission took place that voted on this connectivity charge.

1796
02:35:00,482 --> 02:35:02,303
If we can have a copy of the minutes for that.

1797
02:35:02,503 --> 02:35:04,224
A copy of the minutes be provided also.

1798
02:35:05,422 --> 02:35:08,664
of the meeting where the vote was taken for this connectivity charge.

1799
02:35:09,985 --> 02:35:10,325
Thank you.

1800
02:35:11,326 --> 02:35:12,506
Name and address of the record, please.

1801
02:35:14,007 --> 02:35:15,948
David McKillop, 94 Rockland Road.

1802
02:35:16,789 --> 02:35:18,690
Uh, I live up in an area called the heights.

1803
02:35:19,130 --> 02:35:20,811
I'm sure most people are familiar with it.

1804
02:35:20,931 --> 02:35:25,174
One of the things about the heights that's very unique is our water pressure.

1805
02:35:25,604 --> 02:35:38,039
I had the rare opportunity of sitting across at one of the mayor's meet and greets, the commissioner of the water and sewer, and asked him, has that area of Medford ever been reviewed?

1806
02:35:38,760 --> 02:35:40,102
Because the water pressure is

1807
02:35:40,692 --> 02:35:50,338
It's sometimes so horrific that if I'm taking a shower and my neighbor waters their lawn, I guess I'm taking a cold shower or a very little one or a very fast one.

1808
02:35:51,479 --> 02:35:54,300
And his response to me was, oh, yeah, it's reviewed all the time.

1809
02:35:54,561 --> 02:35:58,863
And it's a very costly review to process.

1810
02:35:58,923 --> 02:36:02,205
And how long ago, my question was, was that reviewed?

1811
02:36:02,345 --> 02:36:04,647
Oh, many, many years ago, but we look at it all the time.

1812
02:36:05,227 --> 02:36:09,149
So my question is, how can we have an $8 million surplus

1813
02:36:10,373 --> 02:36:17,956
and have areas of the city that have a deficit when it comes to things that need to be looked at, repaired, fixed, replaced, changed.

1814
02:36:18,056 --> 02:36:21,498
I know I'm on a five-eighths piping.

1815
02:36:21,898 --> 02:36:24,860
Part of that is so the pressure can kind of maintain a certain level.

1816
02:36:25,700 --> 02:36:35,924
But really, seriously, it's just ironic that we would ask for an additional $1.45 million a year to add what, to the surplus?

1817
02:36:36,185 --> 02:36:36,865
I'm confused.

1818
02:36:37,425 --> 02:36:39,106
And the other thing I really kind of

1819
02:36:40,144 --> 02:36:44,167
me being mathematical, I take 8 million and 9 million and that's 17 million.

1820
02:36:44,187 --> 02:36:48,871
And isn't that pretty close to what we need for a police department, fire department?

1821
02:36:49,471 --> 02:36:50,372
Just throwing it out there.

1822
02:36:50,812 --> 02:36:51,173
Thank you.

1823
02:36:51,773 --> 02:36:52,113
Thank you.

1824
02:36:54,375 --> 02:36:55,456
Name and address for the record, please.

1825
02:36:56,096 --> 02:36:57,818
Robert Penta zero summit road method.

1826
02:36:57,858 --> 02:36:59,199
Mass former member of the sport.

1827
02:36:59,559 --> 02:37:05,824
The path is kind of ironic about this is your projected rates this year for your water and sewer are being reduced by approximately 2.77%.

1828
02:37:08,356 --> 02:37:24,864
So if the Water and Sewer Commission has given you a 2.77 projected rate decrease for combined water and sewer, and as you said, Councilor Marks, they're sitting on $8.5 million in the surplus, why would they now want to go out and hit you with a connectivity fee on a quarterly basis?

1829
02:37:25,264 --> 02:37:32,788
And if you check any cities and towns, most of them that have a connectivity fee, it's a one-time fee, and that's it.

1830
02:37:33,508 --> 02:37:37,210
And it's at the discretion of the Director of Public Works or the town administrator

1831
02:37:37,603 --> 02:37:43,827
If you are a present homeowner landowner and you need to be reconnected, there is no charge.

1832
02:37:44,027 --> 02:37:50,571
It would be for a brand new person coming in, building a house first time around $50 one time fee.

1833
02:37:50,931 --> 02:37:53,673
Usually any point of information.

1834
02:37:53,953 --> 02:37:57,235
Counselor Della Russo was that may 2nd committee of the whole meeting.

1835
02:37:57,375 --> 02:37:59,557
May 2nd is the meeting.

1836
02:37:59,797 --> 02:38:00,117
Thank you.

1837
02:38:01,298 --> 02:38:01,638
Thank you.

1838
02:38:01,898 --> 02:38:02,919
Thank you for interrupting me.

1839
02:38:03,039 --> 02:38:03,979
Counselor Della Russo.

1840
02:38:04,199 --> 02:38:04,920
I appreciate that.

1841
02:38:05,806 --> 02:38:07,387
Is there anything else you want to do before I finish?

1842
02:38:08,187 --> 02:38:09,348
Put your smile on your face.

1843
02:38:09,388 --> 02:38:11,709
You know, let me tell you something.

1844
02:38:11,929 --> 02:38:15,752
You know, when somebody's speaking up here, I don't need to be interrupted rudely.

1845
02:38:15,832 --> 02:38:16,592
Okay.

1846
02:38:16,972 --> 02:38:17,813
Thank you.

1847
02:38:18,113 --> 02:38:18,393
Okay.

1848
02:38:18,633 --> 02:38:19,554
And that's the problem.

1849
02:38:19,734 --> 02:38:26,538
When people view something like this on the council floor and they watch it on television, that doesn't bode very well for you folks sitting here.

1850
02:38:26,558 --> 02:38:28,479
Mr. President.

1851
02:38:28,499 --> 02:38:30,000
I just think it's a shame.

1852
02:38:30,020 --> 02:38:30,720
Point of order.

1853
02:38:30,940 --> 02:38:31,641
Point of order.

1854
02:38:31,881 --> 02:38:33,562
Stick to the subject matter on the agenda, please.

1855
02:38:33,782 --> 02:38:34,062
Thank you.

1856
02:38:35,808 --> 02:38:39,095
The point of order is talking about how this council is going to react.

1857
02:38:40,183 --> 02:38:46,224
with the rate increase of a connectivity fee that you're going to be putting on the taxpayers if it comes to be presented before you.

1858
02:38:46,244 --> 02:38:48,424
I don't think you need to wait until May 2nd.

1859
02:38:48,725 --> 02:38:53,825
I think your vote should take place here tonight that you're not going to approve it, and you're not going to be supportive of it.

1860
02:38:54,706 --> 02:38:56,126
We have a meeting on May 2nd.

1861
02:38:56,166 --> 02:39:02,647
Mr. President, you have an $8.5 million surplus, and you have a projected rate decrease in your water and sewer rate.

1862
02:39:03,087 --> 02:39:05,688
Now, you go out and explain that to the ratepayer of this community.

1863
02:39:05,708 --> 02:39:06,648
We have a meeting on May 2nd.

1864
02:39:06,728 --> 02:39:07,188
Wait a minute.

1865
02:39:07,228 --> 02:39:08,008
Please answer me.

1866
02:39:08,588 --> 02:39:14,490
Explain to me, are any one of the, how do you have a rate decrease when you want to charge a new increase?

1867
02:39:15,370 --> 02:39:16,551
You have the CPA.

1868
02:39:16,731 --> 02:39:18,051
It will be explained on May 2nd.

1869
02:39:18,071 --> 02:39:19,812
You have the CPA as a corollary tax.

1870
02:39:19,872 --> 02:39:20,932
On May 2nd, there's a meeting.

1871
02:39:20,952 --> 02:39:21,633
I understand that.

1872
02:39:21,653 --> 02:39:23,293
You have a corollary tax, the CPA.

1873
02:39:23,653 --> 02:39:26,474
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts is not even going to meet it, not even match it.

1874
02:39:26,654 --> 02:39:26,894
I did not.

1875
02:39:26,914 --> 02:39:29,575
You should not be charging the taxpayers that money.

1876
02:39:29,615 --> 02:39:31,576
It was voted on by the citizens of the state.

1877
02:39:31,596 --> 02:39:34,257
And the citizens and you guys can make a representative, you can.

1878
02:39:34,277 --> 02:39:34,637
Order, Mr. President.

1879
02:39:35,277 --> 02:39:36,438
We have order here.

1880
02:39:37,078 --> 02:39:42,222
You know what the order was when you and Councilor DelaRusso ran around when the people were talking?

1881
02:39:42,282 --> 02:39:44,243
You know something, Mr. President?

1882
02:39:45,044 --> 02:39:54,451
You know, trying to keep order with some folks who were just intentionally, they have no sense of respect.

1883
02:39:54,511 --> 02:39:56,533
They have no respect for people at the podium.

1884
02:39:56,553 --> 02:40:01,736
I understand that, Mr. President, but I do have the podium right now and I have an opportunity to say what I want to say.

1885
02:40:02,917 --> 02:40:04,398
Okay, and I'm sticking to the subject matter.

1886
02:40:04,579 --> 02:40:06,380
And the subject matter is the water, okay?

1887
02:40:06,580 --> 02:40:13,225
And I'm saying to you, as president of this council, your message back to the Water and Soil Commission should be, we are not going to be any supportive of it.

1888
02:40:13,525 --> 02:40:20,130
When Councilmarks gets the minutes of that meeting and they find out how and why they want to keep taxing the people of this community, it's you folks.

1889
02:40:20,470 --> 02:40:21,971
Your election is coming up this year.

1890
02:40:22,272 --> 02:40:23,653
You guys are going to be paying for it.

1891
02:40:24,253 --> 02:40:28,676
Again, May 2nd, all your questions can be answered then.

1892
02:40:29,057 --> 02:40:29,377
Thank you.

1893
02:40:30,802 --> 02:40:31,882
Name and address for the record, please.

1894
02:40:31,902 --> 02:40:34,243
Greetings, Mr. President Caviello.

1895
02:40:35,164 --> 02:40:39,025
Andrew Castaneda, Cushing Street, Medford, Massachusetts.

1896
02:40:40,085 --> 02:40:41,026
How do I start?

1897
02:40:41,806 --> 02:40:43,427
I'll make it very- We're talking about the water.

1898
02:40:44,247 --> 02:40:45,807
Yeah, I'm talking about water.

1899
02:40:46,188 --> 02:40:46,948
That's where we're starting.

1900
02:40:47,008 --> 02:40:48,608
If you're not talking about the water, don't start anything.

1901
02:40:48,628 --> 02:40:49,449
Is it free water?

1902
02:40:50,749 --> 02:40:52,370
There's something in the water, 02155.

1903
02:40:52,950 --> 02:40:54,450
I got my T-shirt.

1904
02:40:54,871 --> 02:40:55,871
It's about the water.

1905
02:40:56,371 --> 02:40:56,991
Listen, Richard.

1906
02:40:58,472 --> 02:40:58,692
Okay.

1907
02:41:00,738 --> 02:41:03,940
This connectivity fee, it's all new to me, Councilor Marks.

1908
02:41:04,321 --> 02:41:12,387
I'd ask you to explain it, but it's kind of late, and some people want to go watch that basketball game, although the only last two minutes is what really counts, in my opinion.

1909
02:41:13,007 --> 02:41:24,396
However, this connectivity fee might be something that might, how you say it, the strata breaks the tax man's back, or the taxpayer's back.

1910
02:41:24,957 --> 02:41:29,280
I enjoyed seeing Councilor Brianna and some other politicians

1911
02:41:29,777 --> 02:41:38,739
yesterday, first time that I recollect ever going to see front of Captain Isaac Hall's house and celebrating our first revolution.

1912
02:41:40,119 --> 02:41:40,439
Thank you.

1913
02:41:42,820 --> 02:41:48,661
I guess the Beatles would say, if you walk the streets, we'll tax your feet, because I'm the taxpayer.

1914
02:41:49,581 --> 02:41:50,461
When does this end?

1915
02:41:51,381 --> 02:41:52,142
At Dela Rousseau's?

1916
02:41:53,142 --> 02:41:53,942
Or Ching Carty's?

1917
02:41:55,148 --> 02:41:56,409
or a cremation of some sort.

1918
02:41:56,689 --> 02:42:00,711
If we're going to talk about the water, we talk about the water.

1919
02:42:00,731 --> 02:42:02,731
We're not going to talk about anybody's business.

1920
02:42:02,751 --> 02:42:04,872
Who polluted the harbor talking about water?

1921
02:42:05,353 --> 02:42:05,593
Me?

1922
02:42:05,753 --> 02:42:05,953
You?

1923
02:42:06,313 --> 02:42:06,493
No.

1924
02:42:06,733 --> 02:42:10,555
The Mills and Lawrence, the GE, the corporations in Woburn.

1925
02:42:11,375 --> 02:42:12,196
Who's cleaning it up?

1926
02:42:13,596 --> 02:42:14,517
The lower middle class.

1927
02:42:15,077 --> 02:42:15,797
It's paid for.

1928
02:42:15,837 --> 02:42:16,277
It's done.

1929
02:42:16,938 --> 02:42:17,798
Why are we still paying?

1930
02:42:19,463 --> 02:42:22,845
May 2nd, you can ask all the questions you want of the Water and Soil Commission.

1931
02:42:22,945 --> 02:42:24,106
Ask all the questions we want.

1932
02:42:24,286 --> 02:42:26,188
Ask me a question, I'll tell you no lies.

1933
02:42:26,668 --> 02:42:27,168
Thank you, sir.

1934
02:42:27,228 --> 02:42:27,689
Thank you.

1935
02:42:29,190 --> 02:42:40,817
On to question by Councilor Mox, as amended by... Do you have any more amendments you want to add on to?

1936
02:42:43,963 --> 02:42:45,664
So I have a copy of the minutes will be there.

1937
02:42:46,025 --> 02:42:49,948
Ron Baker will be there and we'll, and we'll have someone from the administration also be there.

1938
02:42:50,909 --> 02:42:51,389
Is that correct?

1939
02:42:51,429 --> 02:42:52,030
Right.

1940
02:42:52,350 --> 02:42:52,810
Anything else?

1941
02:42:52,830 --> 02:42:56,534
I don't know if you want to get them to answer it ahead of time.

1942
02:42:57,514 --> 02:42:59,916
If they want, if they want to answer ahead of time, they can answer.

1943
02:43:00,617 --> 02:43:07,703
Uh, but May 2nd, hopefully we can get all those questions answered on the motion by Councilor Marks.

1944
02:43:07,823 --> 02:43:08,644
Councilor Falco.

1945
02:43:09,104 --> 02:43:12,567
Mr. President, it'd be nice if we could get those answers ahead of time.

1946
02:43:12,847 --> 02:43:14,788
It'd be nice to go into the meeting prepared.

1947
02:43:15,009 --> 02:43:15,669
We'll do our best.

1948
02:43:15,689 --> 02:43:16,169
Thank you.

1949
02:43:16,370 --> 02:43:16,930
We will request.

1950
02:43:18,171 --> 02:43:21,774
Hopefully they will come before the meeting.

1951
02:43:21,794 --> 02:43:23,495
You're trying to digest it during the meetings.

1952
02:43:23,535 --> 02:43:24,556
I think we're all in agreement with that.

1953
02:43:24,576 --> 02:43:26,717
If we get it before the meeting, it'd be greatly appreciated.

1954
02:43:26,737 --> 02:43:27,057
Thank you.

1955
02:43:27,137 --> 02:43:27,458
Thank you.

1956
02:43:29,139 --> 02:43:34,063
On the motion by counselor marks seconded by by counselor Falco.

1957
02:43:34,103 --> 02:43:34,763
All those in favor.

1958
02:43:36,324 --> 02:43:37,185
Motion passes 17

1959
02:43:40,822 --> 02:43:42,963
3, 6, 8, offered by Councilor Knight.

1960
02:43:43,863 --> 02:43:57,307
Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council request that the administration to examine the feasibility of requiring EpiPens and Epi training to the city's first responders.

1961
02:43:57,967 --> 02:43:58,747
Councilor Knight.

1962
02:43:59,267 --> 02:44:00,708
Mr. President, thank you very much.

1963
02:44:01,208 --> 02:44:07,810
Being a father of children with allergies and understanding the severity thereof in looking at

1964
02:44:08,777 --> 02:44:11,520
the past few weeks, what's going on in the community.

1965
02:44:11,620 --> 02:44:17,026
We have first responders whose job is to save people's lives, carrying Narcan.

1966
02:44:18,108 --> 02:44:29,020
We have our first responders right now reviewing a request that this council made to have defibrillators as part of their first response packets.

1967
02:44:29,720 --> 02:44:38,807
And this is an effort to build upon that, Mr. President, and to ask the administration to examine the feasibility of requiring EpiPens and EpiPen training for our first responders.

1968
02:44:38,867 --> 02:44:43,010
As we all know, when you come into a situation related to allergies, every second counts.

1969
02:44:43,611 --> 02:44:46,653
And most times the police cars get there before the ambulances do.

1970
02:44:47,273 --> 02:44:53,338
And if, in fact, there's a feasible way to provide this training and this product to our

1971
02:44:53,870 --> 02:44:56,571
First responders, I think, will be making Medford a safer place.

1972
02:44:56,791 --> 02:45:02,973
And I don't think there's anybody behind this rail that can argue that our first job isn't to have a focus on public safety, Mr. President.

1973
02:45:03,013 --> 02:45:05,014
We're making great strides in that regard.

1974
02:45:05,955 --> 02:45:10,416
And I think that this is just an opportunity for us to expand upon the services that we provide our citizenry.

1975
02:45:10,476 --> 02:45:12,997
And I'd ask that my colleagues behind the rail support this measure.

1976
02:45:13,297 --> 02:45:13,657
Thank you.

1977
02:45:14,598 --> 02:45:15,558
Councilor Lungo-Kurin.

1978
02:45:16,699 --> 02:45:18,059
Thank you, President Carviello.

1979
02:45:18,079 --> 02:45:20,420
I want to thank Councilor

1980
02:45:21,287 --> 02:45:23,888
Knight, for bringing this forward, I actually saw it on the news.

1981
02:45:24,748 --> 02:45:28,650
A young child from Walpole was being rushed to the hospital.

1982
02:45:28,670 --> 02:45:32,651
Oh, no, actually, maybe that's where you got it.

1983
02:45:33,652 --> 02:45:36,033
EMT came and saved his life with an EpiPen.

1984
02:45:36,153 --> 02:45:38,294
And they said, thank God the EMTs got there.

1985
02:45:38,754 --> 02:45:39,974
We're the first responders.

1986
02:45:40,134 --> 02:45:42,855
And it's a big push by a woman in Walpole.

1987
02:45:42,915 --> 02:45:49,538
I think she's getting help by a couple of state representatives in that area to change the law of the state.

1988
02:45:50,003 --> 02:45:56,568
but I think this is a great resolve put forward by Councillor Knight to implement it in Medford sooner than later.

1989
02:45:57,909 --> 02:46:14,341
So many children and adults and anybody any age have these allergies where EpiPens are being more and more administered and needed and I think if somebody can save a life of somebody who's going into anaphylactic shock, it's going

1990
02:46:15,612 --> 02:46:20,436
I know there's going to have to be training that's going to need to be need to take place, but it's going to be worth it.

1991
02:46:20,816 --> 02:46:22,298
So I second the resolve.

1992
02:46:22,498 --> 02:46:24,499
Thank you.

1993
02:46:24,559 --> 02:46:38,691
Also, Mr. President, I know we've all seen in the news the drastic price increases of EpiPens and individuals that are on fixed incomes may have a little bit of a difficult time purchasing these materials, especially if they're without insurance.

1994
02:46:39,592 --> 02:46:43,255
So one of my fears is that individuals that

1995
02:46:43,841 --> 02:46:47,664
You know, I have allergies that require an EpiPen when they have a reaction.

1996
02:46:48,144 --> 02:46:50,746
I'm going to use that as an area to save costs.

1997
02:46:51,306 --> 02:46:58,431
And if someone's trying to trim their budget and they haven't used their EpiPen in two or three years and it's expired, they might say, well, I'm pretty good at watching the nuts.

1998
02:46:58,451 --> 02:47:02,434
I don't think I need it, which is going to create a worse situation, Mr. President.

1999
02:47:02,474 --> 02:47:06,977
So I, again, thank Councilor Longo for her kind words and move for approval.

2000
02:47:07,337 --> 02:47:08,218
Thank you.

2001
02:47:09,118 --> 02:47:11,500
And I have a grandson that has an allergy and

2002
02:47:12,079 --> 02:47:15,462
EpiPens are $600 a piece and not covered by insurance.

2003
02:47:16,263 --> 02:47:24,650
And he takes one to school, I have one at home, and my daughter is out $1,800 on three EpiPens that you only get a year on.

2004
02:47:24,670 --> 02:47:30,095
So, again, they are quite expensive and insurance should cover them, but they don't.

2005
02:47:30,695 --> 02:47:36,340
On the motion by Councilor Nights, seconded by Councilor Lockern, all those in favor?

2006
02:47:37,261 --> 02:47:38,102
Motion passes.

2007
02:47:40,487 --> 02:47:44,268
Petitions, excuse me, one more.

2008
02:47:44,948 --> 02:47:57,430
17369, offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved, the Board of Health examine the feasibility of establishing a grading system for establishments licensed to sell food products.

2009
02:47:58,150 --> 02:47:58,810
Councilor Knight.

2010
02:47:59,270 --> 02:48:01,031
Mr. President, thank you very much.

2011
02:48:01,211 --> 02:48:07,372
This is a program or a process or a policy that's in place in many communities around the United States of America.

2012
02:48:08,162 --> 02:48:15,486
think about the first time I saw it, I think I was in California when I saw this establishment has been rated a B plus by the Board of Health and its inspection.

2013
02:48:16,307 --> 02:48:19,669
There are other establishments that were seized and other establishments that were raised.

2014
02:48:19,869 --> 02:48:32,617
And what the Board of Health is doing is conducting their food inspections and then making an assessment based upon a certain policy or protocol they put in place to give a grade to that establishment with the hopes that it produces corrective action, Mr. President.

2015
02:48:33,622 --> 02:48:38,126
every food establishment here in the city of Medford meeting every requirement that the Board of Health puts forward.

2016
02:48:38,847 --> 02:48:50,318
So we'll see cities like New York City, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and most recently I believe the city of Boston adopted a system where they're grading establishments based upon the results of their food inspections.

2017
02:48:50,358 --> 02:48:54,202
And I think that this is really a great act to protect the consumer.

2018
02:48:55,339 --> 02:49:15,089
I don't want the policy to create an increased burden on operators or business owners here in the community, but I think that if we sell good products and the city is behind the fact that a business is selling a good product, that we'll have more customers in that business because the city and the government entity has made an effort to further regulate it and to make sure that they're complying by all the rules.

2019
02:49:15,109 --> 02:49:16,789
And then we're telling people they're complying by the rules.

2020
02:49:16,809 --> 02:49:20,351
So I know we have Mr. Pinter at the rail here.

2021
02:49:20,431 --> 02:49:22,532
I thought Mr. McKillop was going to get up because he's a

2022
02:49:22,955 --> 02:49:24,355
He's a business owner and a restaurant owner.

2023
02:49:25,015 --> 02:49:33,817
However, this is a measure that I'd like to get a report back from the Board of Health on as to whether or not this is something that they find feasible and find out if it'll work in the city of Medford, Mr. President.

2024
02:49:33,857 --> 02:49:35,538
So I'd ask my colleagues to support it and move approval.

2025
02:49:36,098 --> 02:49:37,198
Name and address of the record, please.

2026
02:49:37,418 --> 02:49:39,358
Robert Pantazero, Summit Road, Medford, Mass.

2027
02:49:39,718 --> 02:49:46,580
Number one, I would be opposed to this bill if I was sitting on that side of the rail, because number one, I think this is an infringement upon the free enterprise system.

2028
02:49:46,920 --> 02:49:48,440
The Board of Health has a job to do.

2029
02:49:49,040 --> 02:49:52,161
They go out there, they review the product of the restaurant,

2030
02:49:52,740 --> 02:49:54,302
or whatever it might be, that's their job.

2031
02:49:54,722 --> 02:50:02,870
And for them to start taking an arbitrary and capricious action by placing a, A, B, or C on the type of business that's taking place, who are they?

2032
02:50:02,910 --> 02:50:04,072
They don't frequent that business.

2033
02:50:04,132 --> 02:50:08,336
And I think it would lead a very, uh, it would, it would skew.

2034
02:50:08,953 --> 02:50:13,057
the public to go into a certain direction to say one business might be better than another.

2035
02:50:13,077 --> 02:50:16,480
You know, this is just as bad as municipal aggregation.

2036
02:50:16,820 --> 02:50:26,109
You know, you're asking city government to get involved in people's lives, their personal lives, and in this situation, their personal life is a personal business.

2037
02:50:27,110 --> 02:50:32,135
The proposal that's before us is for the Board of Health to examine whether or not this would be a feasible approach.

2038
02:50:32,706 --> 02:50:41,788
And what it is is not to have the Board of Health get involved into the business operations of a business, but to report to the general public that the facility that they're going to eat and purchase food from is clean.

2039
02:50:42,428 --> 02:50:42,788
Thank you.

2040
02:50:43,548 --> 02:50:57,671
When they go and do their job, and they review a restaurant, and they get a certificate on there that says it's been approved, whether it's a milk license, a common ventures license, or any kind of food product license, that's the city or the town telling you that that place has passed the test.

2041
02:50:57,951 --> 02:51:00,132
They don't need to have a rating system.

2042
02:51:01,080 --> 02:51:08,583
When you start getting into a rating system, well, maybe we should have departments come down here and rate you guys and girls on the performance of your jobs, OK?

2043
02:51:09,223 --> 02:51:11,945
You're really crossing over the line on something like this.

2044
02:51:12,525 --> 02:51:14,366
You have a department that does its job.

2045
02:51:14,746 --> 02:51:20,848
And its job is to go out there and to ensure that the food product in a business is safe, it's good to eat,

2046
02:51:22,920 --> 02:51:23,540
And so be it.

2047
02:51:24,041 --> 02:51:27,943
And now if you're going to start putting a rating system on it, I think you're really crossing over the line.

2048
02:51:28,123 --> 02:51:32,805
You know, people spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to go into a food business.

2049
02:51:33,405 --> 02:51:38,148
And if that person upstairs, man or female, who happens to work for the health department, just doesn't

2050
02:51:38,708 --> 02:51:41,631
They might pass the test, but they may not like the person.

2051
02:51:41,852 --> 02:51:43,654
You're getting into a personality conflict.

2052
02:51:43,874 --> 02:51:53,164
How many times have you folks gotten phone calls from people that have a business because they don't like a department head that comes in there and gives them a hard time?

2053
02:51:53,464 --> 02:51:54,966
And it's a personality conflict.

2054
02:51:55,146 --> 02:51:56,547
It's got nothing to do with the business.

2055
02:51:57,168 --> 02:52:06,454
I would strongly suggest that this does not go forward and you leave it just the way it is as a private sector business person coming to the city and applying for their license.

2056
02:52:06,494 --> 02:52:10,217
However it is, they go there, they do their job, but their business takes care of itself.

2057
02:52:10,597 --> 02:52:13,419
Their product sold to the public will take care of itself.

2058
02:52:13,719 --> 02:52:20,104
We don't need any city administration telling a business person that owns a restaurant how they should be rated by this city.

2059
02:52:20,264 --> 02:52:20,604
Thank you.

2060
02:52:21,365 --> 02:52:21,925
Councilor Knight.

2061
02:52:24,006 --> 02:52:25,628
We all do things a certain way.

2062
02:52:26,795 --> 02:52:28,416
And we could all do things better, Mr. President.

2063
02:52:28,676 --> 02:52:37,782
And all this is is an opportunity for us to ask the Board of Health whether or not we're doing things the right way, and if it's feasible to do it a different way, and if that different way is going to be better.

2064
02:52:38,142 --> 02:52:39,783
I don't think it's something we need to yell and scream about.

2065
02:52:40,103 --> 02:52:40,444
Thank you.

2066
02:52:41,504 --> 02:52:42,525
Name and address of the record, please.

2067
02:52:44,085 --> 02:52:49,048
Dave McKillop, 94 Rockland Road, and I do own a restaurant, and I was hesitant to come up.

2068
02:52:49,248 --> 02:52:50,069
I'm not going to lie.

2069
02:52:50,089 --> 02:52:51,530
I know you did.

2070
02:52:52,991 --> 02:52:55,072
There's two rules of thought here.

2071
02:52:56,253 --> 02:53:03,598
The city that I work in, I have an incredible rapport with the department and Larry, the head of the department.

2072
02:53:04,799 --> 02:53:06,320
So we work in tandem.

2073
02:53:07,201 --> 02:53:07,762
He comes in.

2074
02:53:08,042 --> 02:53:08,783
It's a surprise.

2075
02:53:08,943 --> 02:53:10,024
I never know when they're coming.

2076
02:53:10,464 --> 02:53:22,795
There are things that, totally honestly, that they will find that are incredible, and then there are things that they will find that might have slipped through the cracks, whether it's a thermometer that isn't working or something that isn't quite shelved properly.

2077
02:53:23,635 --> 02:53:25,057
But they work really, really hard with

2078
02:53:25,977 --> 02:53:27,418
us as a community.

2079
02:53:28,018 --> 02:53:34,700
And if you work really, really hard with the Board of Health, there's a respect level there that carries very well.

2080
02:53:35,240 --> 02:53:42,443
Now, I can't speak for what goes on in Medford as far as the rapport between the Board of Health and Medford and the restaurateurs.

2081
02:53:43,343 --> 02:53:44,924
I can only tell you that that's something that

2082
02:53:45,438 --> 02:53:54,085
you know, as a whole, you would look at and see the reports and evaluate the situation and make a decision as to, does this make sense for us?

2083
02:53:54,125 --> 02:54:00,750
Should we step up to the plate and do something a little bit different because it's not quite working the way we'd like to based off of the information we have?

2084
02:54:01,290 --> 02:54:03,752
That's kind of the way I personally would approach it.

2085
02:54:04,993 --> 02:54:11,077
If I remember correctly, the grading method was based or actually came about

2086
02:54:12,105 --> 02:54:15,549
do specifically because of the chain businesses.

2087
02:54:16,350 --> 02:54:20,695
Because the chain businesses were the ones that were having a real difficult time staying on top of things.

2088
02:54:21,596 --> 02:54:27,803
Because when you go to franchises or you go to district managers, regional managers, then store managers, then assistant managers,

2089
02:54:28,201 --> 02:54:31,084
It's very, very difficult to kind of maintain a certain level of control.

2090
02:54:31,424 --> 02:54:33,966
And that's kind of where that kind of came from and morphed out of.

2091
02:54:34,367 --> 02:54:37,389
And then it kind of blanketed across and kind of kept going further.

2092
02:54:37,490 --> 02:54:48,420
And to be honest with you too, Mr. Penta's point, there are some areas that it does not work well, that it is kind of a negative kind of,

2093
02:54:49,412 --> 02:54:56,279
reciprocation on the behalf of someone that may not appreciate someone else and, you know, gives them a bad score just simply because they can.

2094
02:54:56,819 --> 02:55:12,494
So it is a double-edged, it can be a double-edged sword, but I think that any community that works with the Board of Health, the restaurateurs, they recognize how important it is, and the Board of Health, if they do it well, and I know in my community they do it very well,

2095
02:55:12,894 --> 02:55:16,837
They work in tandem, and they work really, really hard together to make sure that everything is the way it's supposed to be.

2096
02:55:17,437 --> 02:55:19,298
So that's the only input I can give on that.

2097
02:55:20,379 --> 02:55:23,881
I don't have an opinion one way or the other as to which direction.

2098
02:55:23,941 --> 02:55:26,563
I just say, basically, collect all your data.

2099
02:55:27,223 --> 02:55:28,364
Take a look at your Board of Health.

2100
02:55:28,424 --> 02:55:35,949
And by the way, if I'm not mistaken, the Board of Health is really, it is a department within the city, but it's underneath the umbrella of the state.

2101
02:55:35,989 --> 02:55:36,710
Am I right or wrong?

2102
02:55:37,710 --> 02:55:40,312
I think in the city of Salem, that's the way that they present it.

2103
02:55:43,054 --> 02:55:54,300
Okay, just for clarification, because I wasn't quite sure, because I know that in the City of Salem, they kind of make it as the Board of Health is kind of their own entity within the city working underneath the state, no?

2104
02:55:54,440 --> 02:55:59,883
Okay, so maybe that's not the one.

2105
02:55:59,903 --> 02:56:02,825
There's a lot of things that are governed through state legislation.

2106
02:56:03,773 --> 02:56:04,813
eliminates local control.

2107
02:56:05,173 --> 02:56:08,274
So the answer to that is yes and no, I guess.

2108
02:56:08,574 --> 02:56:10,115
That's kind of the way, the approach I would make.

2109
02:56:10,435 --> 02:56:14,036
And you do have to be careful when anything, anything has to do with something like that.

2110
02:56:14,096 --> 02:56:14,876
So thank you.

2111
02:56:15,076 --> 02:56:15,796
Thank you for your retreat.

2112
02:56:15,816 --> 02:56:16,416
Thank you, Mr. Coats.

2113
02:56:16,977 --> 02:56:18,397
Sorry to.

2114
02:56:18,637 --> 02:56:19,397
Vice president of box.

2115
02:56:20,598 --> 02:56:21,598
Thank you, Mr. President.

2116
02:56:21,978 --> 02:56:23,678
I believe it was about six months ago.

2117
02:56:23,698 --> 02:56:30,700
Uh, during the council meeting, uh, we had the new border health inspector, uh, before us.

2118
02:56:30,780 --> 02:56:33,301
And I asked the new health director,

2119
02:56:34,178 --> 02:56:39,099
uh, where do we stand with, um, border health inspections?

2120
02:56:39,900 --> 02:56:42,881
And I believe they were seven or eight months behind.

2121
02:56:43,921 --> 02:56:48,942
And the reason why I knew that is because I had a number of businesses that said, what do I do?

2122
02:56:48,962 --> 02:56:52,983
My board, my health inspection ran out six months ago.

2123
02:56:53,323 --> 02:56:55,024
Can I still operate my business?

2124
02:56:55,484 --> 02:56:57,625
And that's why I asked the question, Mr. President.

2125
02:56:58,245 --> 02:56:58,745
And you know,

2126
02:56:59,445 --> 02:57:02,868
I think the larger question is, what are we doing right now?

2127
02:57:02,888 --> 02:57:05,109
Are we up to date with our health inspections?

2128
02:57:05,689 --> 02:57:07,611
Do we need more staff in the office?

2129
02:57:08,231 --> 02:57:09,892
To me, that's the larger question.

2130
02:57:10,353 --> 02:57:21,140
If we want to create a rating system, which I'll be quite honest with you, I don't know if I'm opposed or not to it, but if we want to create a rating system, that's to make sure at least we're doing our due diligence

2131
02:57:21,520 --> 02:57:34,656
and making sure we have the appropriate staff and making sure our business has their inspections in a timely fashion so they don't have to wonder whether or not they have to close their door because they don't have a border health inspection.

2132
02:57:35,137 --> 02:57:37,620
So I think that's the larger issue, Mr. President.

2133
02:57:38,200 --> 02:57:58,358
I'm not willing to vote on any paper tonight to move any issue forward, Mr. President, until we find out where we stand with the Board of Health, where we stand on with the inspections, and why is it taking so long for our health department to inspect these businesses in the community, because as we all know, as Councilor Penta mentioned,

2134
02:57:58,718 --> 02:58:07,042
that the Board of Health goes out there and makes sure that the businesses are adhering to code, state and city safety codes.

2135
02:58:07,502 --> 02:58:08,582
That's what their business is.

2136
02:58:08,842 --> 02:58:12,084
And when you get your inspection sticker, that means you're up to par.

2137
02:58:12,344 --> 02:58:27,310
And that means the resident that's going into your restaurant knows your food is prepared in the right way, know that your preparation is right, know the heating requirements and refrigeration requirements are right, and all the cleanliness stuff that goes with

2138
02:58:27,703 --> 02:58:28,943
a border health inspection.

2139
02:58:30,184 --> 02:58:32,425
So that is important, Mr. President.

2140
02:58:33,345 --> 02:58:46,110
At this point, grading a business, I think we've got to go back to fundamentals in this city and making sure we provide the basics, which is a timely border health inspection for all our businesses.

2141
02:58:46,630 --> 02:58:51,912
So I'd like to see that happen first, Mr. President, before I vote on- Would you like to amend the paper to-

2142
02:58:53,725 --> 02:58:58,886
get a report from the Board of Health on where we stand with all the inspections in the city?

2143
02:58:59,927 --> 02:59:03,167
We asked for it, and I believe she gave us a verbal at the podium.

2144
02:59:03,567 --> 02:59:15,070
And honestly, I don't remember the exacts, but I want to say that 30 or 40% of our businesses back some six months ago didn't receive their Board of Health inspection, and they were in the process of doing so.

2145
02:59:15,650 --> 02:59:17,270
So if we could get an update, that'd be helpful.

2146
02:59:17,290 --> 02:59:21,631
Mr. Clerk, if you could please put down that if the Board of Health can give us an update on

2147
02:59:22,085 --> 02:59:26,067
and where we stand with businesses getting their license renewals.

2148
02:59:28,328 --> 02:59:35,611
On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Lococo.

2149
02:59:35,631 --> 02:59:37,552
Thank you, President Carriello.

2150
02:59:37,572 --> 02:59:41,733
I think it's a good discussion maybe we should have with the Board of Health.

2151
02:59:41,793 --> 02:59:42,794
Maybe we can do that.

2152
02:59:42,834 --> 02:59:44,034
Through a proposal.

2153
02:59:44,835 --> 02:59:49,897
Well, through a proposal or we could just talk to the Board of Health at budget time, see where they're at.

2154
02:59:50,463 --> 02:59:56,327
kind of talk about everything at the same time, give it a little extra time with the Board of Health before we move on anything tonight.

2155
02:59:57,227 --> 02:59:59,149
I mean, I see both sides.

2156
02:59:59,289 --> 03:00:02,551
I agree with Councilor Marks, but I understand the point of it.

2157
03:00:02,651 --> 03:00:12,978
So maybe just to have a discussion about it rather than, or definitely get some more clarity of what we're actually asking the Board of Health to report back to us on.

2158
03:00:14,919 --> 03:00:15,599
Councilor Nate.

2159
03:00:18,341 --> 03:00:19,742
The Board of Health could very simply say,

2160
03:00:20,105 --> 03:00:20,845
It's not feasible.

2161
03:00:20,885 --> 03:00:21,506
We don't want to do it.

2162
03:00:22,446 --> 03:00:23,007
It is feasible.

2163
03:00:23,047 --> 03:00:23,607
We can do it.

2164
03:00:24,047 --> 03:00:25,308
All we're doing is asking them a question.

2165
03:00:25,648 --> 03:00:26,248
I don't see the harm.

2166
03:00:27,349 --> 03:00:30,511
On the motion by Councilor Knight as amended by Councilor Marks.

2167
03:00:37,515 --> 03:00:42,917
If the Port of Health is going to put that little thought into it, then I don't even think it's worth asking the question.

2168
03:00:43,718 --> 03:00:46,139
If they sit back and say, well, we can't do it.

2169
03:00:46,579 --> 03:00:48,320
That's not even worth asking the question.

2170
03:00:48,340 --> 03:00:49,301
Or if they sit back and say,

2171
03:00:49,599 --> 03:00:50,260
We can do it.

2172
03:00:50,700 --> 03:00:51,962
I'd like to know why they can do it.

2173
03:00:52,002 --> 03:00:58,169
I'd like to know if they have the personnel knowing the fact that they can't get to their regularly scheduled health visits now.

2174
03:00:58,930 --> 03:01:00,531
How are they going to be able to take this on?

2175
03:01:01,152 --> 03:01:02,934
They're in a depleted staff up there.

2176
03:01:03,675 --> 03:01:04,997
So I think there's more to this.

2177
03:01:05,017 --> 03:01:08,280
I'm not saying it's not a bad idea, but I just think there's more to it.

2178
03:01:08,961 --> 03:01:10,603
And you know, if it comes from the council,

2179
03:01:10,960 --> 03:01:12,340
And we're saying, will you look into this?

2180
03:01:12,800 --> 03:01:14,961
Then it may mushroom into something else.

2181
03:01:15,541 --> 03:01:19,942
And we're going to be sitting there saying, wow, we didn't want you to go that far with it.

2182
03:01:20,182 --> 03:01:21,842
We didn't want you to move that far.

2183
03:01:22,242 --> 03:01:27,483
Because as far as I'm concerned, once this takes place, this will be an administrative policy.

2184
03:01:28,243 --> 03:01:31,924
I don't see this as a city ordinance, unless Councilor Knight sees it differently.

2185
03:01:32,264 --> 03:01:34,085
I see this as an administrative policy.

2186
03:01:34,585 --> 03:01:36,165
And that's not under our purview.

2187
03:01:36,645 --> 03:01:40,526
So we may initiate the ball rolling and not be able to stop that ball.

2188
03:01:41,020 --> 03:01:56,729
And I'm not prepared to do that at this point, not knowing where we stand with the Board of Health presence in our community, the staffing, and the fact that they're not fully equipped to get out in a timely fashion for inspections.

2189
03:01:57,890 --> 03:01:58,250
Thank you.

2190
03:01:58,310 --> 03:01:58,971
Councilor Nice.

2191
03:02:00,071 --> 03:02:02,072
There are two ways to look at every issue, Mr. President.

2192
03:02:02,112 --> 03:02:05,554
We can look at issues as to why we can't do things, and we can look at issues as to why we can't.

2193
03:02:06,515 --> 03:02:08,116
And all I'm doing is asking a question.

2194
03:02:08,216 --> 03:02:09,697
I'd like the support of my council colleagues,

2195
03:02:10,678 --> 03:02:12,018
and that's all I have to say about it.

2196
03:02:12,038 --> 03:02:12,338
Thank you.

2197
03:02:13,559 --> 03:02:18,960
On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

2198
03:02:20,140 --> 03:02:20,960
All those in favor.

2199
03:02:21,780 --> 03:02:24,081
Aye.

2200
03:02:24,121 --> 03:02:26,281
Roll call vote has been requested.

2201
03:02:29,602 --> 03:02:30,502
Councilor DelaRusso.

2202
03:02:30,682 --> 03:02:30,882
Yes.

2203
03:02:31,682 --> 03:02:32,402
Councilor Falcone.

2204
03:02:32,722 --> 03:02:32,922
Yes.

2205
03:02:33,642 --> 03:02:34,182
Councilor Knight.

2206
03:02:34,382 --> 03:02:34,583
Yes.

2207
03:02:35,983 --> 03:02:36,743
Councilor Locke-Kern.

2208
03:02:38,977 --> 03:02:39,457
First president.

2209
03:02:39,477 --> 03:02:43,700
Mark Scott Kelly.

2210
03:02:43,800 --> 03:02:44,040
Yes.

2211
03:02:44,901 --> 03:02:45,842
Four on the affirmative.

2212
03:02:45,862 --> 03:02:59,291
Five in the affirmative, two in the negative motion passes petitions.

2213
03:02:59,451 --> 03:03:06,296
Press as amended petitions, presentations and similar matters.

2214
03:03:08,370 --> 03:03:20,171
17373, petition by Robert L. Capucci Jr., 71 Evans Street, Medford, to address the council concerning municipal aggregation.

2215
03:03:21,153 --> 03:03:22,733
Name and address for the record, please.

2216
03:03:23,154 --> 03:03:24,374
Thank you, Mr. President.

2217
03:03:24,514 --> 03:03:27,735
I'm Robert Capucci, Jr., 71 Evans Street in Medford.

2218
03:03:27,795 --> 03:03:29,915
I'll try to be brief at this late hour.

2219
03:03:30,975 --> 03:03:44,459
Last summer, it was proposed that the city move towards municipal aggregation based solely on it would save the electric rate payers in Medford some money.

2220
03:03:46,299 --> 03:03:46,999
It went away.

2221
03:03:47,460 --> 03:03:49,340
Somehow it came back last Tuesday.

2222
03:03:49,925 --> 03:03:57,550
in a committee of the whole meeting under a new auspice of protecting the environment, Go Green.

2223
03:03:58,331 --> 03:04:13,201
There was a wonderful presentation brought by the company, supposedly going to be hired by Alicia Hunt, the director of energy and environment here in Medford, the chairman of the Go Green Medford community.

2224
03:04:13,981 --> 03:04:16,523
Basically, for the citizens that are watching at home,

2225
03:04:17,705 --> 03:04:32,416
It's a program whereby if passed, if it ever comes to a vote in this council and it does get passed, you're automatically opted into the city buying your power for you, your electricity, with the provision that you can opt out.

2226
03:04:34,497 --> 03:04:38,540
Understandably, what the company said last week was you can opt out at any time.

2227
03:04:39,316 --> 03:04:43,939
There was also a 30 day opt out clause in there.

2228
03:04:44,439 --> 03:04:52,984
But Councillor Marks at the committee of the whole meeting brought up the state law which is after 180 days you cannot opt out.

2229
03:04:53,325 --> 03:05:02,030
And getting into these government contracts doing things on behalf of the people, when they tell you, you know, we'll let you opt out at any time.

2230
03:05:02,871 --> 03:05:04,432
But the state losses something out.

2231
03:05:04,832 --> 03:05:21,357
I'm a little bit skeptical of the whole process I if they if this is really such a good thing They should present it and market it to the people as an as an opt-in if they want to not Force everybody all at once to be a part of this system.

2232
03:05:21,457 --> 03:05:23,177
I mean, that's a slippery slope.

2233
03:05:23,217 --> 03:05:23,777
Where does it end?

2234
03:05:24,037 --> 03:05:26,378
Is the City Council gonna vote that?

2235
03:05:28,066 --> 03:05:31,787
another company buys all my clothes from me, all my groceries.

2236
03:05:32,048 --> 03:05:35,769
It's, it's, it's, it's dangerous precedent that was sent setting.

2237
03:05:36,329 --> 03:05:36,929
It really is.

2238
03:05:37,330 --> 03:05:40,131
But I want to be fair to the other side.

2239
03:05:40,791 --> 03:05:47,494
Uh, counselor Della Russo at the committee of the whole meeting was a very astute and bringing up, I would like to hear opposition to this.

2240
03:05:47,954 --> 03:05:53,956
So I emailed everybody on this council, the citizens against municipal aggregation website.

2241
03:05:54,436 --> 03:05:56,177
I also included the mayor and,

2242
03:05:56,861 --> 03:05:59,683
Alicia hunt, the director of environment and engineer.

2243
03:06:00,183 --> 03:06:06,066
I'm also going to reach out to them if it ever does come to a vote so that the opposite side could be heard.

2244
03:06:06,726 --> 03:06:17,132
I just find it just comforting that the city would entertain the notion of doing something on behalf of every resident.

2245
03:06:18,453 --> 03:06:22,976
from reading the CAMA website, it doesn't always work.

2246
03:06:23,416 --> 03:06:29,459
And if you are locked into it, and they say you can get out, but on that 181st day, you do try to get out.

2247
03:06:29,499 --> 03:06:32,000
For some reason, you can't, and a lower rate comes.

2248
03:06:32,341 --> 03:06:35,162
I mean, you can go to the two sources now.

2249
03:06:35,202 --> 03:06:37,203
It's at Eversource and National Grid.

2250
03:06:37,603 --> 03:06:38,664
And you can click on them now.

2251
03:06:39,377 --> 03:06:42,719
And under those, a ton of other options come up.

2252
03:06:43,020 --> 03:06:45,742
There are choices for citizens to make right now.

2253
03:06:45,802 --> 03:06:51,386
They can enter into a six-month program for, say, $6.99 a kilowatt hour, or another program for $12.99.

2254
03:06:51,686 --> 03:06:59,291
That choice, which is pretty much the fundamental building block of this nation, should never be taken away.

2255
03:06:59,491 --> 03:07:00,692
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

2256
03:07:00,712 --> 03:07:00,912
Thank you.

2257
03:07:03,634 --> 03:07:06,656
Motion by Councilor Knight to receive and Mr. President file.

2258
03:07:06,676 --> 03:07:06,836
Second.

2259
03:07:07,957 --> 03:07:08,838
On the same, Mr. President,

2260
03:07:09,368 --> 03:07:10,148
Councilor Marks.

2261
03:07:11,589 --> 03:07:12,569
Thank you, Mr. President.

2262
03:07:13,309 --> 03:07:16,330
And I thank Mr. Capucci for getting up on this subject.

2263
03:07:16,370 --> 03:07:19,811
I think he hit the nail on the head when it comes to this issue.

2264
03:07:20,451 --> 03:07:27,353
Just so you know, the issue was referred to the energy subcommittee of the council.

2265
03:07:28,433 --> 03:07:32,914
And we plan on having a meeting very shortly regarding this paper.

2266
03:07:33,855 --> 03:07:38,236
But I just want to let it be known, Mr. President, that the city has been going out on its own

2267
03:07:38,897 --> 03:07:45,539
on the school side for a number of years, doing municipal aggregation on the school side.

2268
03:07:46,159 --> 03:07:57,203
And back in 2014, it was reported in the Meffitt transcript that, and the article reads, Meffitt Unplugs on electricity contract cost schools more than $100,000, Mr. President.

2269
03:08:00,148 --> 03:08:17,020
The city, when they went in and purchased on behalf of the schools, failed to renew the contract and had to go back out on the open market and wasn't able to obtain a rate like they had when they had a contract.

2270
03:08:17,380 --> 03:08:25,766
And it ended up costing the schools, which is you and I the rate payer, $100,000 because they failed to do their job.

2271
03:08:26,627 --> 03:08:33,531
So after that glowing recommendation, now they say, you know what, let's do it on behalf of every resident in this community.

2272
03:08:33,971 --> 03:08:35,071
Look at our track record.

2273
03:08:35,372 --> 03:08:39,434
Now we want to bring in every resident and we'll go out on your behalf.

2274
03:08:39,834 --> 03:08:43,596
Anytime the government wants to get involved in your business, Mr. President,

2275
03:08:43,876 --> 03:08:46,137
as far as I'm concerned, is not a win-win.

2276
03:08:46,657 --> 03:08:56,000
When the government says, we want to save you money, that should be the biggest red flag, because the government is not in business to save you or I money.

2277
03:08:56,600 --> 03:08:58,501
They're not in that business, Mr. President.

2278
03:08:58,941 --> 03:09:04,303
So this will get its proper hearing in the Energy Subcommittee, Mr. President.

2279
03:09:04,803 --> 03:09:07,004
But as far as I'm concerned, I agree with the Speaker.

2280
03:09:08,004 --> 03:09:09,785
When the state legislature created this,

2281
03:09:10,466 --> 03:09:15,208
They created a clause where it says it's voluntary in the law.

2282
03:09:15,648 --> 03:09:16,788
This is voluntary.

2283
03:09:17,129 --> 03:09:22,171
However, once your city council votes for it, it's no longer voluntary.

2284
03:09:22,671 --> 03:09:26,052
Everyone is subjected to this new municipal aggregation.

2285
03:09:26,732 --> 03:09:28,973
Then you have the ability to opt out.

2286
03:09:29,654 --> 03:09:38,377
And we all know when we changed our meters over, it took us several years just to change our meters over in this city because people weren't properly informed.

2287
03:09:39,478 --> 03:09:45,742
And to say that, you know, there'll be community outreach and so forth, you know, they made a big mistake with the legislation.

2288
03:09:46,062 --> 03:09:47,463
They should have had it as an opt-in.

2289
03:09:47,863 --> 03:09:55,307
If you're interested, you want to go green, you want to reduce your carbon footprint, and you want to belong to this municipal aggregation, so be it.

2290
03:09:55,627 --> 03:09:57,108
And I think the city should offer it.

2291
03:09:58,084 --> 03:10:01,665
But don't include me in something, Mr. President, and say I have to opt out.

2292
03:10:02,206 --> 03:10:07,768
And then don't say, well, you know, we're going to decide how much green energy you purchase.

2293
03:10:08,268 --> 03:10:10,789
If you don't like that, you can opt out of that, too.

2294
03:10:11,670 --> 03:10:13,410
It's the big opt-out program.

2295
03:10:13,730 --> 03:10:15,491
You can opt out of that, too, Mr. President.

2296
03:10:16,412 --> 03:10:19,313
So I'm not fully sold on this, Mr. President.

2297
03:10:19,653 --> 03:10:21,534
I appreciate Mr. Capucci coming up here.

2298
03:10:22,014 --> 03:10:27,176
And like I said, this will definitely get its fair share of a hearing within

2299
03:10:27,582 --> 03:10:32,603
the Energy Committee, and it will be reported back out to this council to make a full decision.

2300
03:10:33,003 --> 03:10:34,303
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

2301
03:10:38,104 --> 03:10:40,845
Motion by Councilor Knight to receive and place on file.

2302
03:10:40,865 --> 03:10:43,645
Aye.

2303
03:10:43,685 --> 03:10:45,006
Seconded by Councilor Del Rosso.

2304
03:10:46,606 --> 03:10:48,647
All those in favor?

2305
03:10:48,727 --> 03:10:48,847
Aye.

2306
03:10:48,867 --> 03:10:55,088
Motion to take papers in the hands of the clerk be offered by Councilor Scott Pelli.

2307
03:10:55,898 --> 03:11:03,590
Be it resolved that the City Council get a report from the DOT regarding the T bus stop at Main and High Street.

2308
03:11:04,651 --> 03:11:05,673
Councillor Scott Pellick.

2309
03:11:05,913 --> 03:11:06,374
If I can.

2310
03:11:07,460 --> 03:11:12,783
I did receive a few phone calls, obviously, that I've been championing this issue.

2311
03:11:14,343 --> 03:11:31,872
The last meeting we had with the Department of Transportation, they put on the full court press, and the T had supervisors, enforcement, making sure that the bus stops were safe in front of Main Street and High Street.

2312
03:11:32,572 --> 03:11:36,314
I've just been contacting recently

2313
03:11:37,693 --> 03:11:43,375
And I've made it conscious effort to drive there and witness what's happening.

2314
03:11:43,395 --> 03:11:53,719
There's construction now being done further out so the buses again cannot take that turn.

2315
03:11:53,879 --> 03:11:58,240
And again, waiting and pulling out off the sidewalk.

2316
03:11:58,280 --> 03:12:03,422
So if we can get a report back, because I'd like to, you know,

2317
03:12:04,047 --> 03:12:15,456
possibly move on this and, uh, and, and get the final word on, um, eliminating that bus stop until the construction is done before somebody gets, uh, seriously injured.

2318
03:12:15,556 --> 03:12:16,177
So thank you.

2319
03:12:16,357 --> 03:12:16,697
Thank you.

2320
03:12:17,338 --> 03:12:21,541
On the motion by Councilor Scott Pelley, seconded by Councilor Longo Kern.

2321
03:12:21,561 --> 03:12:25,504
All those in favor?

2322
03:12:25,704 --> 03:12:25,824
Aye.

2323
03:12:25,844 --> 03:12:27,486
17.375 offered by President Caraviglia.

2324
03:12:28,166 --> 03:12:33,090
Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council offers its condolences to the family of Giovanni

2325
03:12:33,664 --> 03:12:36,605
Gio Maggiore, who passed away this last week.

2326
03:12:36,685 --> 03:12:41,366
And Gio was a son of Medford school teacher, Maya Maggiore.

2327
03:12:42,026 --> 03:12:47,347
And it's a lot more tragic when it's a little small child that passed away.

2328
03:12:47,387 --> 03:12:49,867
And it seems to hit home a little bit more.

2329
03:12:50,408 --> 03:12:51,968
So if we could stand for a moment of silence.

2330
03:13:01,770 --> 03:13:02,050
Thank you.

2331
03:13:04,492 --> 03:13:04,852
Records.

2332
03:13:06,133 --> 03:13:06,914
We'll pass the council.

2333
03:13:07,834 --> 03:13:08,455
Councilor Lockhart.

2334
03:13:09,516 --> 03:13:10,136
Councilor Lockhart.

2335
03:13:10,376 --> 03:13:11,457
Thank you, President Carvalho.

2336
03:13:11,517 --> 03:13:24,706
Just before we adjourn, I just want to congratulate all those who ran the Boston Marathon, especially Medford residents, including our colleague, George Scarpelli's wife, Dina, Kelly, and Chris Shields.

2337
03:13:24,806 --> 03:13:31,531
There were a number of Medford residents, and we were tracking them with our phones, so they did amazing, and it was a great, beautiful day.

2338
03:13:31,924 --> 03:13:33,065
Congratulations.

2339
03:13:33,225 --> 03:13:35,426
Again, it wasn't me that was running.

2340
03:13:36,367 --> 03:13:37,288
I was just tracking it.

2341
03:13:37,868 --> 03:13:38,709
It was my wife.

2342
03:13:39,149 --> 03:13:39,930
She did a great job.

2343
03:13:39,970 --> 03:13:40,870
Very proud of her.

2344
03:13:41,231 --> 03:13:44,213
She was exhausting but she did a heck of a job.

2345
03:13:44,393 --> 03:13:44,813
Proud of her.

2346
03:13:47,755 --> 03:13:55,162
Mr. President, I think it's also important to point out what a great job long-time Medford resident David McGillivray, Boston Marathon race director, has been doing.

2347
03:13:55,182 --> 03:13:55,742
My classmate.

2348
03:13:55,902 --> 03:13:57,263
Yes, and he's been involved.

2349
03:13:57,283 --> 03:13:57,263
1972.

2350
03:13:57,824 --> 03:14:01,667
He's been involved in this race now, I think it's for the last 40 or so years.

2351
03:14:02,288 --> 03:14:09,094
And one of the things that I heard on the radio today that was amazing to me, Mr. President, was that he's at the starting line at Hopkington when the gun goes off.

2352
03:14:09,434 --> 03:14:12,597
Then he's at the finish line on Boylston Street when the first wave comes through.

2353
03:14:12,950 --> 03:14:16,512
And then at eight o'clock at night, he's back in Hopkinton running the race himself.

2354
03:14:17,232 --> 03:14:22,915
Um, so it just shows what a commitment and what a love he has for the sport and how, uh, he's been able to turn this passion into a career.

2355
03:14:22,975 --> 03:14:24,635
And it really is inspiring.

2356
03:14:24,675 --> 03:14:26,436
So I'd like to thank Dave for all his work as well.

2357
03:14:27,076 --> 03:14:29,858
I just wanted to congratulate Dina for finishing the race.

2358
03:14:29,918 --> 03:14:30,498
Great job.

2359
03:14:30,738 --> 03:14:36,200
And, uh, also to, uh, Medford resident, uh, who actually grew up here, uh, Joe LeBlanc.

2360
03:14:36,581 --> 03:14:41,483
Uh, he actually, uh, was involved in, but he grew up here in Medford and he actually ran for charity as well.

2361
03:14:41,543 --> 03:14:41,663
So.

2362
03:14:42,239 --> 03:14:43,440
Congratulations to him as well.

2363
03:14:43,560 --> 03:14:43,900
Thank you.

2364
03:14:46,783 --> 03:14:48,224
Records, we'll pass the council tonight.

2365
03:14:48,244 --> 03:14:55,110
Name and address of the record, please.

2366
03:14:55,150 --> 03:14:56,772
Ricky Cormier, 150 Middlesex Ave.

2367
03:14:56,792 --> 03:14:59,054
I just want to congratulate my sister, Julianne Cormier.

2368
03:14:59,234 --> 03:15:03,177
She ran for Camp Shriver and she finished the race in just over five hours.

2369
03:15:03,257 --> 03:15:04,018
So she did a great job.

2370
03:15:04,939 --> 03:15:05,719
Congratulations.

2371
03:15:05,760 --> 03:15:06,060
Thank you.

2372
03:15:07,665 --> 03:15:10,347
Records were passed to Councilor Knight.

2373
03:15:10,407 --> 03:15:12,629
Councilor Knight, how did you find those records?

2374
03:15:16,832 --> 03:15:22,836
Councilor Knight has asked the records be tabled for one week so he can perform an extensive review.

2375
03:15:24,037 --> 03:15:27,960
Motion by Councilor Scarpelli to adjourn, seconded by Councilor Falco.

2376
03:15:28,060 --> 03:15:28,741
All those in favor?

2377
03:15:30,702 --> 03:15:31,323
Meeting adjourned.
