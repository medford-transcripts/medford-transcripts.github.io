    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=100.796s">Please</a>  rise and salute the flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=103.777s">I</a>  pledge allegiance to the flag <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=111.007s">one</a>  nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=122.272s">Motion</a>  by Councilor Knight to take a paper out of order. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=125.314s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=127.295s">All</a>  those in favour? <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=129.196s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=130.356s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=133.057s">Mr.</a>  President, I move to take paper 1771, the Wage Theft Prevention Ordinance, from the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=138.6s">It</a>  is eligible this evening for its third reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=141.123s">This</a>  is a paper that has gone through the subcommittee process and through the committee of the whole process. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=144.965s">And</a>  what it is, Mr. President, is it's a proposal to ensure that people that are bidding on public contracts here in the city of Medford comply with the wage and hour laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=154.09s">It</a>  requires that a series of certifications are made and a series of statements of credibility are made to the administration so that when they're awarding a contract, the individuals that are awarded the contract have not been found in violation of any wage and hour laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=168.117s">Wage</a>  theft is a problem across the country, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=170.762s">It's</a>  something that we see here in Massachusetts a lot of times with contracts like cleaning contracts. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=175.767s">For</a>  example, the high school has a cleaning contract, and they may bring people in to clean the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=181.393s">And</a>  the prevailing wage rate, which they are supposed to be paid by law, is $26 an hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=186.132s">But</a>  these employees are hourly workers that make $18 an hour when not working on the prevailing wage. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=190.714s">And</a>  their employer will withhold those funds, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=193.015s">So</a>  they're actually employers that are stealing money from their employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=196.176s">So</a>  this ordinance requires that people that are bidding on public projects that are covered under the prevailing wage laws and other state and federal hour and wage laws, Mr. President, are in compliance. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=206.1s">They</a>  inform the city whether or not they've been found in violation. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=209.622s">And</a>  they take out certain bonds if they have been found in violation. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=213.818s">With</a>  us here this evening we have some individuals that were instrumental in putting this work, this ordinance together, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=219.56s">This</a>  is a paper that was originated through a group called Community Labor United. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=223.961s">It's</a>  been a matter that's been endorsed and supported by the Greater Boston Labor Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=227.722s">And</a>  here this evening with us from the Greater Boston Labor Council we have Rich Rogers. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=231.779s">We</a>  also have representing Sean O'Brien from Local 25, James Donovan, political director. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=237.264s">We</a>  have from Local 537, Bill Young here with us this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=241.167s">I'd</a>  be remiss not to mention Louie Mandarini from Local 22, a longtime Medford resident, Mr. President, who was instrumental in crafting this language and also helped with some technical assistance. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=251.195s">And</a>  also with us, we have Phil Reason from the Painters Union here. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=254.398s">Mr.</a>  President, this is a paper that Mayor Burke and I worked on in concert with the individuals that have been aforementioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=259.966s">It's</a>  something that I wholeheartedly support, and I'd ask my colleagues this evening to vote in favor of it.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=265.309s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=267.751s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo? <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=269.072s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=271.313s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=277.137s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=396.856s">Councilor</a>  Dela Rosa.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=399.429s">I</a>  see no reason to object to this request for a variance. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=406.294s">This</a>  gentleman brings business and good commerce to the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=412.478s">It's</a>  a decent family business, and we wish them all the best, and I have no objection. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=420.163s">Motion</a>  for approval, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=421.544s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Joan Cyr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=566.45s">Jones</a>  here, 40 Cedar Road North, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=570.098s">So</a>  I sent an application in to the mayor for a seat on the community preservation commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=576.461s">As</a>  many of you know, I'm a resident of Medford, 17 years, was part of the preserve Medford campaign committee a couple of years ago to collect signatures to get the CPA on the ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=586.585s">And</a>  when it did pass, I was a member of the ad hoc committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=589.883s">that</a>  was assembled to draft the ordinance and to usher it to completion to the City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=596.31s">In</a>  the application, it stated, you know, that an applicant should be a resident who has expertise or demonstrated interest in open space, recreation, historic preservation, and affordable housing, among other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=608.863s">And</a>  that's what I sort of applied for because <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=612.987s">Improving</a>  these things in the city of Medford is very important to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=615.85s">I</a>  know that these are the things that are usually on the bottom of the list when it comes to budget time. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=619.713s">Of</a>  course, police, fire, safety, those kinds of things are much more important and usually get the dollars, and these ones don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=626.499s">So</a>  this is one of the reasons why <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=628.29s">I</a>  really felt that we could bring some good dollars to Medford, that we could improve the city and bring money into Medford by improving the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=635.154s">So</a>  my certification as a project manager, one of the things that I do is I help the others that are in the room kind of use their expertise and bring it to fruition. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=645.219s">So</a>  I'm the one who sort of helps people remove roadblocks, bring people together, open communication, that kind of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=651.382s">And</a>  that is the expertise that I could bring to this committee to kind of help the process move along and keep in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=657.173s">That's</a>  why I applied, and I would appreciate your support, and I really do hope to help Medford become a more inviting city.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1207.915s">Mr.</a>  President, so far we've seen three candidates, and they all have their own expertise and style. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1216.085s">And</a>  it's refreshing to hear Joe just mention the fact that with the housing market, as we know, in Cambridge, Somerville, and Method is experiencing right now, that there is a lack of affordability in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1228.952s">And</a>  I know with my children and other children in the community, that's a big concern that eventually someday they may not be able to afford to live in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1237.896s">And</a>  when you hear Joe mention that, that is something that's on his radar, and he's well aware of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1243.999s">It</a>  makes me feel comfortable as one member <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1246.104s">Although</a>  a million dollars every year may not go far to adding a lot of additional affordable housing, but it's something that this committee will be responsible for. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1256.289s">So</a>  I also, Mr. President, move approval.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1524.798s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1527.639s">There</a>  was a number of meetings and a number of <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1531.132s">neighbors</a>  that were concerned about the property at 21 Toro Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1538.414s">It</a>  was purchased about a year ago and the neighborhood really worked with the Medford Historical Commission to create a local historic district for 21 Toro. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1553.318s">It's</a>  something that the neighborhood is extremely excited about and it was quite refreshing having attended those meetings with <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1560.674s">a</a>  few of my colleagues, refreshing to have the owners of 21 Toro Ave be on board and almost excited about this endeavor. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1569.261s">So</a>  it's something that's long overdue for the council approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1573.025s">And</a>  I would like to vote on that tonight that we make 21 Toro Ave a local historic district to preserve the history of the property and into the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1584.214s">Um,</a>  this will, <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1585.511s">be</a>  recorded at the Registry of Deeds, and it's something that is long overdue to be voted by the council, and hopefully we can all support this and move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1593.114s">And</a>  I believe we're the last step in getting this push forward, so I think it's something that we need to act on sooner than later.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1602.077s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Locren.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1603.958s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1605.398s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1606.298s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Locren, for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1610.5s">I,</a>  too, went to those meetings, and I think it's so important <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1613.675s">I</a>  think we also visited that whole neighborhood and visiting and looking into that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1618.083s">I</a>  believe that we also voted during budget time to approve some funding to increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1624.335s">That</a>  would be something that <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1626.098s">if</a>  we can to maybe help us where we are with those monies. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1629.801s">Have</a>  they been expended? <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1631.582s">Are</a>  we putting, I believe that we were putting the, the, um, the, not the monuments, but there was the, uh, uh, the plaques at historical locations. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1644.208s">I</a>  know that we were looking to.</p>

    <p>[Christopher Bader]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1644.988s">Typically,</a>  we have not provided plaques, but we can certainly do. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1648.33s">Excuse</a>  me. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1649.791s">Oh,</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1650.211s">Let</a>  me introduce myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1652.112s">My</a>  name is Chris Bader. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1652.972s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1655.474s">298</a>  High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1657.935s">I'm</a>  the chair of the Historic District Commission, and we're in charge of creating new historic districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1664.918s">Sorry,</a>  Chris. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1665.258s">And</a>  as you say, we should absolutely put a plaque indicating this is the King House <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1672.687s">with</a>  its construction date, approximate construction date of the 1840s. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1677.068s">It's</a>  part of the historic, it's an important historic building in South Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1685.751s">And</a>  let me just give you a brief summary of the events that led to this becoming <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1697.747s">a</a>  candidate for her local historic district, which is that it was owned by Tufts University. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1703.309s">And</a>  they kind of pulled a fast one on the grandfather's house, where they subdivided it with no public input, and then sold the entire property to a contractor who immediately sold off grandfather's house itself and built a <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1723.869s">prefab</a>  house on the remaining property. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1727.712s">And</a>  everyone was upset about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1730.055s">Then</a>  they wanted to do exactly the same thing on 21 Turo. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1734.639s">They</a>  had no intention of destroying the historic house, but they had their eye on that very juicy piece of property. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1741.745s">The</a>  neighbors were outraged. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1743.987s">It</a>  was really a grassroots uprising, you might even say. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1751.744s">And</a>  finally, the Tufts and the new perspective owner backed down and agreed to sell it to someone who agreed not to subdivide the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1765.027s">I</a>  think historic districts, part of our job is not just to preserve historic buildings, but to preserve open space. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1773.309s">And</a>  a lot of these historic houses are on big lots. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1777.49s">And</a>  the neighbors want to keep it that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1782.377s">It</a>  was tentatively resolved with the new owners that they would put a historic preservation restriction on the deed. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1790.58s">Now,</a>  the problem is this is a historic preservation deed of preservation restriction of limited duration. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1799.502s">And</a>  moreover, the building department does not have easy access to preservation restrictions. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1805.724s">It's</a>  there at the registry of deeds. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1808.51s">But</a>  it's not something there that a building inspector is going to be able to look at in a few minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1816.195s">So</a>  we decided we would, in addition to the historic preservation restriction, we would seek local historical status. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1826.321s">We</a>  sent out, there's an elaborate process spelled out by the Mass Historical Commission, which we followed. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1833.025s">It</a>  took about a year to actually get it through. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1836.667s">We</a>  held a public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1839.182s">We</a>  were actually amazed to find that no one opposed it, including the owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1844.164s">In</a>  fact, they really were delighted. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1847.105s">We</a>  held this public hearing after a 60-day waiting period and blah, blah, blah. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1854.169s">And</a>  really, the last step is now for you guys to vote on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1858.61s">It</a>  requires per Massachusetts General Laws 40C, it requires a two-thirds vote of the <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1869.78s">of</a>  the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1871.441s">That</a>  means five of you guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1873.642s">Um,</a>  and we would appreciate your support. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1877.405s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1879.146s">Any</a>  questions?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1884.829s">Tell</a>  me what this, uh, in creation, this, uh, historic district at 21 Toro F yes.</p>

    <p>[Christopher Bader]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1892.034s">Uh,</a>  defined 21 Toro F it is the current, it is the house and the current property. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1899.373s">uh,</a>  that is in, that is registered at the registry of deeds as 21 Turo. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1904.916s">So</a>  it is both, uh, this is not something that can be subdivided or built on without the permission of the historic district commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1914.621s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1932.486s">Have</a>  we received any communique on this from the city solicitor? <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1936.388s">Uh,</a>  we have not. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1937.428s">The</a>  city solicitor has, um, has the habit of speaking for himself. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1943.391s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Christopher Bader]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1944.991s">Uh,</a>  he, um, he was, he basically, there was very basic language, uh, added to the, uh, existing bylaws of the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1955.29s">in</a>  accordance with Master Noland's 40C, and the city solicitor approved that language. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1962.952s">Basically,</a>  there's nothing in there besides adding the King House to the list of the other two historic districts in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1974.616s">Otherwise,</a>  no changes whatsoever to the Medford bylaws. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1980.217s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Christopher Bader]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1988.816s">So</a>  now right now, okay.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=1991.097s">And</a>  right now, um, this would bring this, if we take this to a vote this evening, it would bring this issue of 21 to wrap the finality and it would have its single home historic district classification.</p>

    <p>[Christopher Bader]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2000.642s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2002.523s">Mr.</a>  President, I move for approval.</p>

    <p>[Christopher Bader]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2014.294s">That</a>  are in immediate danger of subdivision As the reason for the developer buying them not that I'm aware of no There are of course historic houses all over Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2026.243s">They</a>  need protection and we're working on a plan to a general plan to protect these houses particularly those <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2038.399s">in</a>  close to Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2042.2s">For</a>  example, the Andrew House, the David Osgood House, which is owned by the Unitarian Church but is in very poor condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2051.782s">And</a>  we don't think Grandfather's House is in any danger at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2055.763s">The</a>  damage has already been done with the construction of the prefab house that was built next to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2065.445s">So</a>  we're focusing <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2067.268s">at</a>  the moment in houses near, uh, uh, uh, square.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2072.912s">And</a>  if the council were to vote on this tonight, do you know when it would become effective?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2203.013s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2206.335s">Um,</a>  I know that the demo delay Chapter 48 isn't, <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2213.217s">subcommittee,</a>  so I'm not sure what councils have been able to read it, but I believe the commission and myself or whoever will be able to get a copy to anybody that hasn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2223.127s">Um,</a>  this proposal was voted in favor by the Medford historical commission and it is outlined in yellow. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2232.335s">Um,</a>  the version I have outlined in yellow with the potential changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2238.645s">And</a>  obviously, one of the biggest changes is we currently have a six-month demo delay that has been around for quite some time. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2247.811s">But</a>  times are changing, and a number of different communities are moving towards extending their demo delay or already have a 12-, 18-, or 24-month demo delay. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2258.739s">I</a>  know that I believe Winchester's working on pushing it to a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2265.864s">Watertown</a>  has 24 months, Somerville <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2268.523s">has</a>  an extended demo delay. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2270.644s">Lexington,</a>  Concord, they're at Woburn. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2274.046s">There</a>  are a number of cities and towns around us that do have a demo delay. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2281.089s">The</a>  commission in their annual report, Medford Historical Commission in their annual report, it shows 2016, the amount of demo delays is up, I don't know, would you say 90%? <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2299.05s">The</a>  norm was about one to two requests for a demolition of a historical property. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2304.833s">This</a>  current ordinance we have is anything 1900 or above, built in 1900 or above. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2311.957s">In</a>  2016, not only were there 17 applications for demo delays, but the historic commission found that 17 properties were historically significant and preferably preserved. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2328.804s">So</a>  I think that's an important factor. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2330.745s">It</a>  goes to show that times really are changing. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2333.786s">We've</a>  had uproar in the city over a number of different parcels. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2339.048s">Walnut</a>  Street brings to mind what's been, as of recent, you have 18 Walnut Street, you have the property across the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2348.112s">You</a>  also have a property that was listed, and I'm not gonna name the address, but it listed, and I believe it was listed on MLS, because I do have access to MLS, <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2358.008s">I</a>  did read it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2358.628s">I</a>  don't have it in front of me, but it was advertised as a single-family home that could be turned into four units. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2366.69s">So</a>  that's a problem to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2368.79s">It's</a>  a problem to our neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2371.111s">The</a>  residents in the community are not happy with the current state. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2375.352s">And</a>  the six-month delay is not deterring what it used to deter. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2382.053s">You</a>  can go over the Walnut Street property and what's going on there, and that gives you significant proof <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2387.121s">you</a>  know, what I just stated. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2389.662s">So</a>  why is the delay? <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2391.502s">And</a>  this is put, this is question and answers that have been put out by the historical commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2396.143s">Why</a>  is the delay being changed from six months to 24 months or potentially why are we requesting that? <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2401.704s">Why</a>  am I asking the council to support this? <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2404.465s">Primarily</a>  because the commission has found that the present six month delay is not effective. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2409.306s">The</a>  commission has seen numerous cases where owners or developers have showed no interest in working with either the commission <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2415.635s">or</a>  the neighborhood to look at alternatives to demolition and simply waited out the six-month demo delay time frame and demolished the property anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2425.241s">A</a>  larger potential demo delay time frame of up to 24 months is generally too long a time frame for a project to become dormant. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2433.127s">And</a>  the commission feels that the extra time will give the demo delay some teeth and leverage that will serve Medford and our neighborhoods better. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2441.684s">and</a>  why the changes are being proposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2444.106s">And</a>  I just stated already over the last five minutes, there are several significant historic buildings that have been demoed. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2453.793s">Residents</a>  have been upset. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2455.315s">And</a>  as the real estate market continues to improve, no more vacant land exists. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2459.318s">The</a>  threat of Medford's historic buildings is ever increasing. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2462.98s">The</a>  proposed bylaws tries to address these concerns by providing time to research alternatives to demo before any more historic buildings are lost. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2471.853s">It</a>  also clarifies previously undefined terms and creates a standard set of mandates for applicants to complete in order for the commission to lift the delay. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2480.22s">I</a>  know we have a number of residents and we have Ryan Haywood. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2484.323s">I</a>  reached out to him last week after I got emails and phone calls from concerned residents on the Walnut Street property. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2492.73s">And</a>  you see Facebook, there's a number of people that are interested in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2497.074s">And</a>  I believe the time is now, whether we have a committee of the whole meeting, <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2501.182s">or</a>  we decide to move forward with this tonight, I think it's something that we need to move on quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2508.585s">Ryan</a>  was gracious enough to meet with me, and I know he'll meet with, or has met with other councilors as well, to explain in depth what the ordinance entails, the proposed changes to it, how they will affect in more detail than I can give the community, and I think it's a win-win, and I think it's something that we need to discuss and move forward with. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2530.325s">leave</a>  it to the people, the residents who are thankfully came tonight to support the paper.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2535.486s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2536.306s">Again,</a>  I thank a Councilor longer current for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2540.027s">Uh,</a>  this is, this issue is, is greater than what it reads itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2544.728s">I</a>  think that what we're seeing in our community with our questions and zoning and a lack of true development plan, I think is it, <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2553.518s">This</a>  one key issue really sums up what we're seeing as probably the number one now major issue and concern in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2564.425s">I</a>  too was part of the subcommittee that saw this as an issue and moved it forward for 12 months with a possible another six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2574.671s">So</a>  looking at that 18 months, that's something we wholeheartedly supported. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2578.554s">and</a>  subcommittee, I think that it is still was brought back and then put to the city solicitor for final approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2589.116s">I</a>  think that bringing this forward kind of gives you that kickstart that we need to get a final answer and whether it's in committee of the whole or in the open meetings to get this <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2604.035s">get</a>  this through. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2604.676s">I</a>  think it's very important because what we are seeing is free reign throughout our community and making sure right now, looking at a historical community and tying that <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2617.697s">and</a>  holding that off where we have that control right now, I think is vital. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2622.338s">So</a>  I appreciate my fellow council for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2626.179s">I</a>  appreciate all the hard work and the emails that I did receive from multiple community members and concerns that were brought forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2634.64s">I</a>  know that one member came behind this reel last week and we had a depth conversation because you can hear it in their voices. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2641.401s">And</a>  when people seeing communities that <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2645.801s">that</a>  we know as of Medford changing right in front of your eyes and it looks like we have no control. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2651.024s">So</a>  I think this is a great resolution to at least put a stop to this right now and give us a little bit more control as we look into the zoning and development concerns that we do have for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2664.05s">So</a>  I wholeheartedly second this, this motion and moving this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2668.753s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2670.934s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2672.094s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2673.755s">Um,</a>  by way of history, <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2675.46s">I'd</a>  like to just give a, give a brief breakdown as to, um, the process in June of 2016. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2680.142s">Um,</a>  the historical commission came before the council during budget hearings and express some concern about the demolition delay. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2688.825s">Um,</a>  at that point in time, in June of 2016, uh, I was working on a proposal with Mr. Haywood based upon some recommendations that he had in council. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2696.428s">Longo</a>  current put forward a resolution requesting that, um, the demolition delay be looked at in June of 2016. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2701.57s">That</a>  paper was referred to the zoning and ordinance committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2705.235s">and</a>  it was introduced by way of a subcommittee hearing language. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2709.238s">Language</a>  was put together and in August of 2016, the Zoning and Ordinance Subcommittee reported the following changes to 48-78B out of committee favorably for full review and vetting from the committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2724.227s">The</a>  first recommendation that the subcommittee made was to strike the figure 1900 and replace that with homes built within the last 75 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2731.291s">Presently,</a>  homes subject to demolition delay <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2734.954s">have</a>  to have been built before the year 1900 and the recommendation of the subcommittee was to strike that and replace it with homes built within the last 75 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2743.38s">Um,</a>  also the subcommittee, uh, agreed in their committee report, which was reported out favorably, um, underneath four eight dash seven eight B subsection H to strike the figure six months and replace it with the figure 12 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2757.769s">And,</a>  uh, that would be the amount of time for which the demolition delay can take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2761.64s">Um,</a>  also under section I two, um, would be strike six months and replaced with 12 months again, a housekeeping to ensure that, uh, the ordinance would reflect that demolition delay would be 12 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2772.523s">Um,</a>  the subcommittee also recommended that a new section be added to four, eight dash seven, eight, um, which would allow for the historical commission to petition the city council for an additional six months of demolition delay. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2785.408s">Um,</a>  if they felt certain requirements and criterias weren't met, this was, <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2791.512s">reported</a>  out of the committee in August of 2016 and set for a committee of the whole hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2797.977s">The</a>  matter was being scheduled for a committee of the whole hearing when the commission asked to hold off and presented us with a revamped ordinance that they wrote that was a little bit more than just increasing the number of years that it takes to make a house eligible for demolition delay and also increasing the amount of time for which they have to delay <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2821.136s">demolition</a>  of a house. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2823.318s">So</a>  in October of 2016, the Historical Commission presented those changes to the subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2828.521s">And</a>  in October of 2016, the subcommittee requested some technical assistance relative to some questions that were raised relative to legalities. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2836.906s">Those</a>  were sent to the Office of Community Development and the legal department. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2841.329s">Those</a>  questions weren't answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2842.97s">And</a>  in January 2017, there were some subcommittee changes with the change of the leadership to the president. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2848.161s">So</a>  councilor Dela Rousseau for councilor Falco and councillor Me night now make up the committee in February of 2017 a meeting notice was posted to reconvene and discuss this matter where we had not received any response from the administration at which time the snowstorm struck and The meeting was canceled because City Hall was closed so that brings us to February 2017 mr. President so it appears that as of <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2875.495s">In</a>  August 2016, the subcommittee had reported out a paper favorably to the Committee of the Whole, and there is a paper that is now at the Committee of the Whole that would address this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2884.741s">The</a>  recommendations were to increase the number of years for which a home would be eligible for a demolition delay to be built within the last 75 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2892.046s">It</a>  would also give a 12-month automatic demolition delay with the ability for the commission to petition this council for an opportunity for an additional six months, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2903.502s">recommendations</a>  still remain on the table and can be brought up at any time. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2906.244s">We</a>  can move forward on those tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2908.085s">Um,</a>  the proposed ordinance that the commission put together, um, was a little bit more inclusive than just addressing issues of time and of delay. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2920.152s">Um,</a>  and there was a number of concerns that were raised by the subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2922.773s">The</a>  subcommittee, um, was waiting to get some answers back from the administration's legal team and community development team that hasn't happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2928.937s">And</a>  we share the frustration that the individuals behind the rail share, <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2932.014s">However,</a>  if the matter is just as simple as increasing the number of years to look at a house and the amount of time to delay demolition, there's a paper that's sitting right at our Committee of the Whole right now that we can act on, Mr. President, and that will address that issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2943.96s">And</a>  then we can go and continue to properly vet the proposals. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2946.721s">And</a>  that's the course of action that I would recommend.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2948.842s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2950.443s">Vice</a>  President Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2952.464s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2953.764s">And,</a>  you know, this is such an important ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2959.848s">And</a>  in my opinion, waiting for a legal opinion, waiting for the administration to move on something is long overdue. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2970.875s">And</a>  I'd rather see something put forward and have us worry about maybe some ramifications down the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2979.34s">I'd</a>  rather see some protections in place right now, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2984.123s">And</a>  what makes this community so unique <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2987.377s">is</a>  the, and you hear it over and over again, is the very uniqueness of every neighborhood, Mr. President, and every style of home in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=2997.923s">And</a>  slowly but surely, we're losing the style of this community to these large salt box type homes and condominium projects, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3010.583s">all</a>  for the sake of adding additional units and additional money for the developers. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3018.507s">And</a>  you know, as was mentioned earlier, many of these older homes are on larger properties like on Walnut that have additional space. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3028.832s">And</a>  the developers see this nothing more than a way of making additional money. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3033.935s">And</a>  we as a community have to safeguard ourselves <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3036.68s">And</a>  I think this is a great step in the right direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3039.121s">I'd</a>  rather see the 75 years extended to 100 years and beyond, to be quite honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3048.426s">And</a>  the 12-month, in my opinion, is not long enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3053.908s">I</a>  think what was offered as 18-month for a demolition delay, or even 24-month, at least provides this community with ample opportunity <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3064.2s">to</a>  safeguard its historic homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3067.041s">So</a>  I personally would like to see us take a vote tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3070.982s">I</a>  think that's what Councilor Lungo-Koehn has requested. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3074.303s">The</a>  resolve says from six months to 18 or 24. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3078.165s">I</a>  think we have to narrow it down naturally before we vote on it, because you can't have 18 or 24. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3083.546s">It</a>  has to be one or the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3085.527s">But</a>  I definitely think, and I'm prepared tonight to move this forward, Mr. President, because I've been around a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3094.692s">And</a>  I'm not going to wait to hear with an opinion that may be rendered down the line that we've been waiting on already for six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3102.578s">Um,</a>  because, uh, I, I rather move forward, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3106.361s">Uh,</a>  this is long overdue and I would support, uh, the resolution tonight, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3114.207s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3114.587s">I</a>  want to get to, um, allow the speakers to speak, but I, I too would be agreeable to even if we vote for a demo delay, <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3123.94s">tonight,</a>  whether it be the 12 months that the committee discussed with an extension of six months or an 18 month demo delay. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3129.922s">I</a>  think we should move forward on a vote like that tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3133.583s">And</a>  then we do have a number of other changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3136.104s">Maybe</a>  we can meet in committee of the whole to discuss changing the ordinance completely, but I think we need to move forward on something. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3142.527s">I</a>  think the votes may be here to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3144.307s">So</a>  I'd like to hear from the speakers and I'm agreeable to my colleagues.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3149.569s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3150.35s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3152.165s">If</a>  I could, through the chair, ask Councilor Knight again to restate his recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3157.429s">I</a>  believe that he was suggesting that we had something in Committee of the Whole, and we have two contrasting things, so I just want some clarity, if I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3167.557s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3169.058s">The</a>  recommendation of the subcommittee coming out of the August subcommittee report, which was favorable and unanimous, <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3176.638s">would</a>  be to strike the figure 1900. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3178.698s">Right</a>  now it said any home built before 1900 was subject to a demolition delay. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3182.719s">We</a>  wanted to reduce that figure to any home built within the last 75 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3186.02s">That</a>  was the recommendation of the committee that was reported out favorably. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3189.64s">That's</a>  subsection B under ordinance 48-78. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3194.901s">We</a>  also have the opportunity to strike the figure six months and replace it with 12 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3200.122s">And</a>  that was a reference to the amount of time for which the demolition delay would be in effect. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3204.208s">That's</a>  under 48-78H. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3207.829s">And</a>  we also have a reference to six months in 48-78I, subsection 2, which also made a reference to a six-month demolition delay. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3216.711s">And</a>  the recommendation of the committee was to strike that and replace it with 12 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3220.772s">So</a>  the committee made an initial recommendation to change the purview of homes that are subject to a demolition delay from houses that were built before 1900 to houses that were built within the last 75 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3231.554s">So</a>  that would be a rolling scale. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3234.386s">Um,</a>  we also agreed to give a 12 month demolition delay. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3238.168s">And</a>  then there was new language that was reported out favorably, which said that, um, the commission would have the right to petition the city council for a delay of an additional six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3246.953s">So</a>  that would give us 18 months of demolition delay if they could show that certain criteria weren't met. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3251.575s">And</a>  that was the recommendation that was reported out of the subcommittee.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3254.177s">And</a>  that, uh, if I could, again, through the chair, that was all agreed to or arrived at with input from the commission and also, uh, the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3263.84s">At</a>  Alia?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3265.701s">That</a>  is correct, Mr. President, Councilor Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3268.363s">The</a>  commission and the council met on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3271.466s">The</a>  language changes were minor in nature and didn't raise any question or concern about legality. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3277.41s">When</a>  we started getting into a two year demolition delay and some of the changes that were in place, some concerns came up relative to whether or not there would be legal standing as to whether or not that was a land taking. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3288.939s">Some</a>  questions and concerns about financing of projects and stuff, stuff that really, <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3293.821s">I</a>  think warranted concern, but not stuff that should be a deal breaker. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3297.884s">Number</a>  one. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3298.264s">Number</a>  two, I think that, you know, moving forward, we have some recommendations from the subcommittee that met that are sitting on the table at the committee of the whole that will address the issues in the ordinance that have brought forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3307.83s">They</a>  will extend the demolition delay period of time from six months to 18 months or a year guaranteed and potentially 18 months if need be. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3317.375s">And</a>  it will also change the type of home. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3320.298s">that</a>  is subject to a demolition delay. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3321.839s">And</a>  that's something that I could support this evening, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3323.98s">I</a>  have the subsections and the languages, uh, the language, um, performing this evening and I'm writing it up, uh, right now for the city clerk and I'll present that by way of emotion.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3331.644s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3331.965s">And</a>  so if I could, so then if I remember correctly, we were prepared to have committed the whole meeting on those proposals, uh, yet we're asked not to buy the commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3344.272s">So</a>  they had additional, uh, additional items that they wanted to put on. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3349.182s">And</a>  then once we got those, the sequence of events happened that we haven't met. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3357.609s">Mr.</a>  President, I'm not prepared to vote on this tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3361.232s">I</a>  think we need to sort out what has to be done, do that in the Committee of the Whole, at your discretion, Mr. President, and also have the assistance, the paper was reported out to Committee of the Whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3373.945s">And</a>  I have the assistance of the city solicitor present with us to lend his expertise. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3381.646s">I'm</a>  not at this point asking to table. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3387.627s">I</a>  will not support the motion that's before us to vote and approve this. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3392.268s">I'm</a>  not going to support an ordinance change without three readings until we have clear language and the opportunity to come to clarity on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3404.012s">with</a>  papers before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3405.213s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3406.734s">Councilor</a>  Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3408.135s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3408.815s">I</a>  just wanted to, uh, just go on the record of, um, you know, I was a member of the subcommittee that has been, um, that met with the commission and, uh, has been working on the ordinance changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3419.263s">I</a>  mean, I definitely support, uh, you know, updating the ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3422.785s">I</a>  think we need to do more to protect, protect our historic homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3425.827s">I</a>  mean, you know, as, as time goes on and we see these homes disappear, it really, uh, you know, has a negative impact on the, <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3433.138s">it</a>  really changes the fabric of our neighborhoods and we need to do more. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3437.26s">Um,</a>  you know, the, the, the, the subcommittee has been working, um, to actually make changes to the resolution, uh, to the, uh, ordinance to actually do more to protect historic homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3447.406s">And,</a>  uh, so far, I mean, I know we've been working hard on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3450.507s">We've</a>  been working hard with the commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3452.589s">Um,</a>  and I do support extending the, uh, demolition delay as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3456.651s">So</a>  I just want to go on the record of saying that, but, um, I do support this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3460.373s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3465.025s">And</a>  you're good. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3466.086s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3466.266s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3466.886s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3469.368s">It's</a>  Ryan Hayward, 40 Sharon nav Medford, uh, Councilors and friends of Medford history promise to be succinct tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3477.773s">Tonight</a>  I stand before you as the chairman of the Medford historical commission where the official municipal bodies charged with the preservation, promotion and development of historical assets of our hometown. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3490.061s">One</a>  of the many ways we accomplish our mission is by administering the demo delay, which is before you tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3495.688s">And</a>  it was adopted in 1994 by this very board. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3499.912s">It</a>  was established for protecting the city's significant historical, cultural, and architectural buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3504.838s">And</a>  if invoked, the delay period is a maximum currently of six months and only applicable to buildings built before 1900. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3512.012s">The</a>  intent of this pause is so that the applicant can make reasonable, continued, and bona fide efforts to save the irreplaceable asset. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3520.654s">In</a>  most cases, however, the commission has found that the existing bylaw is ineffective. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3528.496s">And</a>  the commission has found that we have little influence over the course of action. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3533.637s">Scores</a>  of developers, absentee landlords, neglectful property owners, <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3538.64s">and</a>  profit seekers have chosen to wait out that short timeline and even build it into their schedules at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3545.687s">We</a>  have found that there is an unsettling trend towards demolition rather than renovation. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3551.033s">Applications</a>  have tripled in the last three years alone, and many of these were notable landmarks that we knew and loved. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3558.958s">The</a>  time now is to overhaul this bylaw and make it an effective preservation tool through Councilor Knight and now through Councilor Longo Cohen. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3567.382s">I</a>  respectfully request that the city council immediately move forward with the demolition delay revision of chapter 48 article four as presented in subcommittee to the demo delay subcommittee last September. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3579.887s">This</a>  is not the original bylaw that was proposed before that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3583.548s">I</a>  respectfully disagree with Councilor Knight that the commission had no input on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3587.918s">And</a>  then, unfortunately, we got word after the fact that that subcommittee did vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3592.362s">And</a>  so we put forth our own proposal, which went to subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3598.347s">Highlights</a>  of these changes include much needed revisions to the definitions, changes to the reviews and timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3604.577s">including</a>  buildings that are 50 years old to be in compliance with our certified local government status and the national park service, including language to discourage demolition by neglect. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3615.887s">And</a>  most importantly, changing the timeline from six months to two years to give this board the leverage it needs to influence projects involving our historic buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3626.277s">By</a>  extending the demo delay, we will join scores of other communities that have said yes to better projects, <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3631.608s">Yes</a>  to preservation and yes to ensuring that we have something to leave behind for the next generation. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3637.752s">I</a>  look to you all for your support as it should be clear that you have our support and I'm happy to answer any questions that you guys have on this as you guys move forward in process. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3649.959s">Just</a>  to be clear too, the question was raised about properties that were up for demolition. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3654.982s">I</a>  mentioned in my annual report that I will have sent to the mayor tomorrow <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3660.88s">There</a>  were 18 properties that came under review last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3664.404s">Only</a>  six of them fell under the demolition delay, but we reviewed... <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3669.42s">I</a>  reviewed personally, at least double that amount that were not applicable to the review, unfortunately. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3675.163s">So</a>  we're losing buildings on a month-to-month basis, and sometimes more than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3680.146s">There</a>  are six buildings that have already come up, two of which are currently going through the process of demo delay review, one on Codding Street, one on Walnut Street, which is just coming up for the first leg. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3693.539s">And</a>  then there's, I've heard, gotten word that there's another building just down the street from the other Codding Street building, which is currently under review. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3700.684s">So</a>  there are several buildings which are coming up and just being bought, all of which have been owned by long-time owners, absentee landlords at this point, or have approached owners to sell their historic buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3712.111s">So</a>  this is an ever-increasing problem that I see will not be going away in the near future. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3717.114s">So</a>  by changing this bylaw and doing it right now and doing it once, <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3721.953s">and</a>  being all-inclusive, it will afford us some time to be able to continue to influence projects in lieu of zoning until you guys are ready to change zoning.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3732.859s">Councilor</a>  Longo-Kurt.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3733.8s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3735.341s">Thank</a>  you for your, um, for coming tonight and explaining that to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3739.223s">If</a>  I could ask you a question with regards to reviewing the entire ordinance and committee of the whole within the next month or two, um, if we wait, <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3747.145s">to</a>  put a demo delay and we don't vote on it tonight, what does that mean if it's postponed one, two, three, four months? <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3753.649s">There's</a>  going to be additional demo requests that are going to get grandfathered in and we're not going to be able to stop it.</p>

    <p>[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3760.914s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3761.315s">I</a>  think you're going to find that there's going to be one of these huge rushes on demolition that anybody who might be even whispering or thinking demolition <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3768.512s">will</a>  put forth an application. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3770.312s">Long-time</a>  owners who might be thinking of selling will probably put forth an application just so that they can clear the table and clear the hurdle long before. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3777.474s">Because</a>  right now, there is no limit on the timeline of determination. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3781.735s">So</a>  once we make a determination on whether a building is or isn't, unless there's significant reason to change that finding, it's a forever decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3789.996s">So</a>  people can wait out the six-month delay the moment that they have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3794.237s">And</a>  even if they're not selling, then sell the building is a vacant lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3797.863s">So</a>  there is no recourse.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3799.828s">And</a>  just to make it clear, you don't have a developer <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3805.02s">the</a>  property to put in a demo delay, they just have to get approval and signature by the current owner, isn't that correct?</p>

    <p>[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3810.565s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3811.546s">In</a>  the current case of 18 Walnut, which is coming up for review, the developer is acting as the owner's representative, and I have received a letter of approval from the current building owner, giving him permission to apply for demolition. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3827.2s">So</a>  even before he owns the property, an applicant can <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3831.118s">you</a>  know, apply for the demolition and then just wait it out and have an active purchase and sales agreement and then move forward with a vacant lot as soon as they're ready.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3840.041s">As</a>  one, one Councilor to the chair, I don't see any reason why we can't vote to increase the demo delay tonight, especially where committees reviewed it and move forward with recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3851.725s">Um,</a>  as well as in addition, I'd like to amend my resolve to include that any property 75 years or older be, um, I, <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3861.7s">75</a>  years or 75 years or older as the committee, um, discussed and reviewed and put forward, um, that that be reviewable by the historic commission.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3872.268s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_29]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3875.21s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3875.611s">I</a>  missed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3876.491s">Are</a>  you asking me if it's, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3878.613s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3878.953s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3879.373s">Anything</a>  else? <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3881.035s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3881.475s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3884.637s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Doug Carr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3886.238s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3886.799s">Doug</a>  Carr, one 24 Boston Avenue, West Benefit. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3889.301s">I</a>  serve and have served with Ryan. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3891.742s">on</a>  the historic commission for the past four years. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3894.643s">I</a>  want to echo what he said. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3895.663s">It's</a>  been really, um, a snowballing effect in the city of Medford in the last couple of years as these properties, um, have come one after another. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3905.386s">And</a>  it's been a challenge for us because we haven't had the tools we need to protect the resources that we know we want to preserve for the longterm. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3914.388s">And</a>  I would recommend, um, that 12 months is not enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3917.629s">18</a>  is a minimum. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3918.69s">24</a>  is preferred. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3920.471s">Keep</a>  in mind that the commission, at any time during that period, can reduce that if they're getting cooperation with the developer. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3928.053s">It's</a>  not all inclusive. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3929.633s">If</a>  they decide to save the building, we can immediately end it or amend it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3932.393s">Or</a>  if they decide to renovate or add on to the building, there's ways that we can reduce it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3936.794s">But</a>  it gives us that leverage. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3938.715s">The</a>  leverage is the key with this thing, because we have virtually no leverage. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3941.715s">If</a>  somebody comes in on September, the demo delay <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3945.581s">All</a>  they're doing is waiting out the winter, which they're not going to build anyway, most of the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3948.482s">So</a>  it really is meaningless for a lot of developers if they time it right. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3952.344s">Um,</a>  so I think that's really important that it's truly a minimum of 18 perfectly 24. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3956.405s">Um,</a>  and that we, uh, execute this as quickly as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3961.327s">I</a>  would like to echo something that counts. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3962.928s">One</a>  of the council has said earlier that we're really missing. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3966.71s">This</a>  is a first piece of several pieces. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3969.311s">You're</a>  missing a lot of pieces when it comes to planning in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3973.438s">You</a>  don't have any design review in Medford for any building under 10,000 square feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3978.38s">So</a>  you can't control anything about a new building. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3982.622s">You</a>  have no tools in which to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3984.422s">And</a>  this has been brought before the council many years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3987.223s">It</a>  didn't go anywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3988.524s">But</a>  I think the effort needs to be revived because design review is something that a lot of cities and towns have. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3994.426s">It</a>  gets a higher quality development. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=3997.175s">It</a>  forces developers who would put cookie cutter buildings to not do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4001.316s">And</a>  one of our developers who's put up a building, they're just taking a building they built anywhere and plopping it down in every neighborhood they can. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4009.737s">It</a>  has nothing to do with the character, context, or anything about the quality of the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4016.118s">We</a>  can't prevent that right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4017.419s">So</a>  you need to look at demo, not only demo delay, but design review as well, which has been long overdue in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4024.14s">Another</a>  thing that's missing here, <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4026.719s">is</a>  planning capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4028.119s">We</a>  don't have enough planning capacity in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4031.861s">I</a>  know Lauren and Claude upstairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4033.061s">I've</a>  known them for 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4033.961s">They</a>  do wonderful work, but they do not have enough people to do what they need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4038.943s">We</a>  need a complete rewrite of zoning right now in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4041.763s">That's</a>  why every project in the city needs multiple variances, because we have zoning that has frozen in time in 1960. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4048.825s">You</a>  need 2.1 cars, whether you're 100 feet from a T station or two miles from a T station. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4054.83s">So</a>  the planning aspect of the city is just completely outdated. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4058.791s">And</a>  I know the council has voted monies to increase the staff in last year's budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4063.311s">But</a>  as of right now, that hasn't happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4065.492s">So</a>  the planning capacity of Medford is critical. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4068.232s">And</a>  I found it, frankly, embarrassing that the master plan for the city of Medford, which is now 12 years old and largely unexecuted, we still can't get to this day. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4078.874s">We're</a>  executing little pieces of it here and there with grants rather than with in-house planning and expertise. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4084.617s">So</a>  planning is the umbrella and zoning, demo delay is one of these components, but there are two or three other legs of the stool that will help Medford get a higher quality built environment, preserve our historic architecture, and give us a better quality of new construction across the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4102.422s">So</a>  I urge you all to pass this as quickly as possible, 18 or 24 months, but then start addressing the other concerns as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4109.344s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4110.425s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Jean Nuzzo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4117.509s">Jean</a>  Nuzzo, 35 Parris Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4119.43s">I</a>  apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4120.09s">I</a>  have a bit of a cold. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4122.811s">So</a>  being an owner's project manager in construction and development, I work in facts. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4130.534s">And</a>  I have a few facts that I'd like to put before you for consideration as you think about this demo delay and development in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4139.736s">Currently,</a>  today, the city of Medford has 13 properties <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4145.016s">listed</a>  for sale. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4146.579s">Thirteen,</a>  that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4149.024s">Of</a>  those thirteen, three are in condo complexes that were designed to be condo complexes. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4157.211s">Four</a>  are two-family or three-family homes that have been condoized, and the remaining eight are listed single or two-family. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4168.697s">Of</a>  those eight, four are listed with some variation of attention developers and contractors. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4177.109s">So</a>  that's what's going on in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4179.271s">It</a>  is being positioned and sold as a place where some person, male or female, with a truck, some tools, and some capital, can come in here, quickly pick up a property, and do whatever they want with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4197.386s">That's</a>  what's happening in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4200.838s">Another</a>  pertinent point of information that I think you need to understand and consider is what our price-to-rent ratio is in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4208.62s">Well,</a>  what's a price-to-rent ratio? <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4211.021s">It's</a>  where you take the value of a property that's for sale, put it over the rent times 12 months a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4223.718s">The</a>  city of Medford right now sits roughly at 17.4. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4226.64s">There</a>  are four cities in the state of Massachusetts that are higher than Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4233.986s">Beacon</a>  Hill, the Back Bay, the South End, and South Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4239.05s">Cambridge</a>  and Somerville are irrelevant because they have been gentrified. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4243.374s">This</a>  is a measure of gentrification. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4246.017s">What</a>  is gentrification? <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4248.119s">It</a>  is that mechanism that pushes the people who live in a city out because they can cease to afford to live here. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4258.132s">That</a>  mechanism that takes potentially a resident who lives in a historic building and encourages them to sell because of what's happening around them and the recognition that their taxes are going to get to the point where they're not going to be able to afford to live in the city that they have raised a family in and chosen to stay in and potentially to age and place in. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4281.513s">So,</a>  this measurement, the four cities that are above us, I want you to think about, Back Bay, South Boston, Beacon Hill, those are some pretty significant price point opportunities. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4294.585s">And</a>  I don't discourage those types of price points. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4297.187s">I</a>  think in the nature of real estate, they're critical, but we're getting a false inflation <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4303.132s">that's</a>  happening here because we're losing our two-family and three-family homes, which are a mechanism for young families and individuals to buy a piece of property and be able to afford it because of the rental capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4317.968s">What's</a>  critical about this is that these two-family and three-family projects that these, quote, developers, or as I call them, flippers, come in, they come in and they buy that property, and because it's less than 10 units, they're not required to put in any affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4338.186s">So</a>  they're making all profit. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4340.309s">So</a>  there's a misnomer that this development is going to benefit our housing market and drop the value of property so that it's affordable because we're going to increase our stock. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4353.028s">simply</a>  not going to happen by converting two families and three families and parceling off double lots and making exceptions for nonconforming units to put in another two family or three family, because those developers are not going to sell it at an affordable rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4369.822s">That's</a>  not what's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4371.163s">That's</a>  not what's going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4373.385s">Not</a>  unless we make a decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4375.987s">We</a>  as a city voted, tonight you as a committee voted to affirm the appointments of a CPA that is looking as part of their process to preserve both building and green space. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4389.76s">And</a>  yet we continue to allow, quote, developers to come in and parcel our large lots and put up these <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4399.97s">Fast</a>  prefab Fabricated in a factory somewhere building that is a fraction of what they would pay for stick build construction They're not bringing jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4412.021s">They're</a>  simply lining their pockets in my opinion and my observation so I think that there's a message that can be sent here tonight by this committee and <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4421.809s">And</a>  the message is, the line is drawn. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4425.01s">We</a>  welcome developers, but we welcome developers that come with a purpose, that come with a desire to collaborate, and that want to improve the city as well as make a profit. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4437.374s">And</a>  I think the fastest way to send that message is to say, yes, no more six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4443.516s">Now</a>  it's 12, it's 18, it's 24. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4444.716s">It's</a>  12 with two options. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4448.637s">whatever,</a>  but I would encourage you to do it because tonight is an opportunity to send one of two messages. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4456.002s">That</a>  we're here and as a city we're going to stand and support our history and the culture that we want to develop as a group or we're going to sit aside and we're going to let people who are here to make a profit take advantage of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4470.031s">Thank</a>  you for your time.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4550.698s">We</a>  do live in a capitalist.</p>

    <p>[Tom Lincoln]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4559.469s">That</a>  every building deserves to be saved, but certainly there needs to be a process where we can have careful consideration, use some creativity, encourage outside money or inside money and developers to do the <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4574.648s">the</a>  right thing for neighborhoods and for our heritage. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4578.549s">It's</a>  always true that once you lose an old building, it's not coming back. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4584.551s">So</a>  I commend the council for bringing up this issue for the various boards that have advanced this cause and hope that you will extend the demolition delay period and provide other <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4602.393s">means</a>  for advancing this important issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4606.016s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4613.602s">Robert</a>  Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass, former member of the Sarkis party. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4617.706s">You</a>  know, a city that forgets about its history won't have any history. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4622.029s">And</a>  at the rate we're going in the city right now, the way developers have this opportunity to come in here, seize a piece of property, build upon it, and then take off and make a profit on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4632.407s">Perfect</a>  example is Luminaires on Locust Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4635.488s">Puts</a>  the building up, he's there a year, sells it for $61 million, and he's gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4640.51s">But</a>  we're talking about something right now is the history of our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4644.312s">And</a>  while Councilor Lungo-Koehn brings up this issue, whether it be 18 to 24 months, for which I would prefer 24, think of it like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4651.494s">Within</a>  the past three years, you folks in a concentrated area of South Street, Toro Ave, and Walnut Street have seen historical pieces of property <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4661.058s">and</a>  trees, if you're a lover of trees, and trees be demolished by out-of-towners, outsiders. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4669.023s">People</a>  are only here to do one thing, and that's to make a profit on the piece of property and beg upon the people to maybe sell their property, make a big profit, and leave town so they can take over, make some money, and they can leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4681.872s">It's</a>  not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4683.132s">We</a>  heard one of your Councilors indicate that the last time you people submitted a report in October, <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4688.908s">It</a>  went from October to January and then it got lost somewhere in translation. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4693.411s">That</a>  in and of itself is the telltale sign of what this city administration thinks about. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4698.195s">preserving</a>  its history, preserving the history of neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4702.337s">And</a>  speaking about neighborhoods, when you lose zoning in your neighborhoods, whether it's for an historical purpose or what have you, you've lost the character of your neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4711.981s">South</a>  Boston, if you've been following this for the last two weeks, is a perfect example where the residents have gotten together on the development of a gentleman who wants to come in there and take over a piece of property <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4722.765s">that's</a>  perfectly zoned for what he wants to do, but the neighbors are opposed to it because it doesn't fit the character of the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4731.592s">The</a>  state representative from that area, Michael Flaherty, has proposed a piece of legislation, and I believe he's doing it tomorrow morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4737.717s">He's</a>  proposing a piece of legislation that the character of the neighborhood has to be kept in line for that for which is there. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4743.301s">It</a>  cannot be made to look anything different or obnoxious or something that's not satisfying to the public or to the people in that neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4752.102s">You</a>  know, we're not going to be here in a few years, because however God decides to take us, and when he decides to take us, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4759.448s">But</a>  you guys and girl, you have an opportunity here to make the legacy of this community continue to go forward in a positive way. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4766.993s">If</a>  the city administration doesn't want to have the same eye on the prize, then you people should have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4772.758s">And</a>  the zoning should be changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4774.279s">And</a>  the 24 months should be changed, because you'll tell you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4777.261s">If</a>  a developer comes in here and finds out that he might have to wait 24 months to get that piece of property zoned or done for whatever he needs to do, he might think one of two things. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4787.929s">Number</a>  one, I'm going to work with the people, or I'm getting out of here because I don't want to deal with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4792.092s">And</a>  you know something? <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4792.733s">That's</a>  probably the best thing, because he's not the real person that should be here for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4796.676s">And</a>  isn't it interesting that all the people that are coming into the city are out-of-towners? <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4801.535s">You've</a>  got to thank the people who took up the charge on Locust Street to bring it to court, to challenge the developer, for which finally found itself before your body and you folks, likewise, to challenge the developer. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4815.757s">The</a>  neighborhood that took on the Salem Street, the Breakpro project. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4821.54s">The</a>  neighborhood people had to bring it together. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4823.761s">Not</a>  the city administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4825.502s">I</a>  don't know how many more black eyes that this city administration needs to get to find out what its history is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4831.245s">But</a>  you certainly are making history by destroying pieces of property that have not only historical value, they have a family and a personal and a community value. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4842.351s">Do</a>  the right thing tonight, ladies and gentlemen. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4844.613s">Vote</a>  for the 24 months, because within that 24 months, you can bargain or they can bargain with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4850.457s">But</a>  at least the people of this community will know that as an elected official, at least you folks, as a city councilor, are doing the right thing in behalf of the taxpayers of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4861.344s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4870.601s">Hi,</a>  I'm Cheryl Rodriguez. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4871.962s">I</a>  live at 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4874.943s">And</a>  the first thing that everyone says when we talk about Medford is the Medford market is hot. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4879.284s">There</a>  was an article this Sunday in the Globe about, hey, Medford, move there. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4882.746s">That</a>  place is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4884.767s">And</a>  Boston Magazine had an article recently about North Medford being great. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4888.748s">You</a>  know what's great about the city being great already is that we're not desperate. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4894.077s">We</a>  don't have to sell to the guy who sends you that letter in the mail that says, hey, I'll buy your house site unseen for $300,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4900.964s">Because</a>  you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4901.665s">There</a>  are families with children that want to move to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4906.089s">Because</a>  we have a deep history. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4907.611s">We</a>  have a fabulous community. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4909.833s">We</a>  have a spirit of volunteerism that is unmatched in other towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4913.457s">And</a>  you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4915.13s">Paul</a>  Revere rode through here yesterday, and it was a very different Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4918.711s">We</a>  need to hold on to those pieces of history. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4921.932s">Back</a>  in the day that I was at Medford High, Dr. Valeriani, AP US History, sent us all out to research our homes, to trace the history. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4930.574s">And</a>  we went into the tombs of the Cambridge District Court and traced the history. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4934.876s">And</a>  the home, my childhood home, was a beautiful double lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4938.977s">I</a>  won't give the address, because I don't want any developers going in and destroying it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4945.288s">When</a>  my grandparents moved to Florida, we left the book that I had made in high school that had traced the history all the way back to the shipbuilding days. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4953.715s">Because</a>  Medford is steeped with history, and it's important to all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4957.878s">My</a>  parents bought their home, and there were pictures of ships that had been built in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4962.802s">And</a>  these things are important. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4963.963s">These</a>  things need to be preserved. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4966.044s">I</a>  bought my own home here, and I got my own little Medford acre, which is a big yard. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4971.448s">If</a>  you add up the square footage I could probably build four units but that's not what I want. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4977.29s">I</a>  want to keep Medford the way that it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4981.471s">We</a>  do need to grow and expand but we don't need to go down the streets and look in people's yards and say I could put three in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4988.033s">I</a>  could. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4989.093s">That's</a>  not the kind of building that we're looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=4993.335s">So</a>  I think that you should definitely pass this ordinance to do the 18 to 24 demo display delay because the fastest way to get a legal opinion back from this administration is to pass something. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5004.378s">And</a>  that's like, whoa. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5006.079s">And</a>  then you'll have your answer inside of a week, definitely. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5009.0s">And</a>  with all due respect, if I put in and look, I'm looking for information and I don't get follow-up, <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5014.642s">From</a>  the person I sent out to, I'll keep bothering them every two weeks, every month, because August 2016, not having an answer is totally unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5024.229s">And</a>  I understand that people in this administration are busy, but if this is important to us, zoning is important to us.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5030.673s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5032.455s">August</a>  2016 was when the zoning subcommittee issued its report. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5036.397s">September</a>  2016 was when the, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5040.161s">district</a>  committee, the commission presented their changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5042.643s">So</a>  there was a month and a month break between when the council was moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5047.348s">And</a>  when did this, when the commission came before the council and then we asked those questions, but their questions got asked after August, 2016. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5055.035s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5055.335s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5056.493s">Well,</a>  September, that's a big difference, that 30 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5059.874s">I</a>  mean, keep waiting. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5061.134s">What</a>  are we on, seven months now? <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5063.754s">I</a>  feel like this is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5065.295s">Every</a>  time I go down to the building office and I look through those books, I see demo permit, demo permit, demo permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5073.096s">This</a>  needs to be done now. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5075.156s">We</a>  don't have time. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5075.957s">If</a>  you wait six more months to put this in committee, I'm not sure how long that moratorium has been in the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5081.638s">I</a>  waited, was at a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5084.038s">For</a>  your subcommittee and you're waiting for an opinion on that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5086.8s">These</a>  things are happening and they're happening now and Once these houses are not done. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5091.603s">They're</a>  gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5092.043s">You</a>  can't rebuild you can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5093.444s">Oh,</a>  well, let's rebuild that 1890 house We never should have knocked it down. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5096.906s">It's</a>  gonna be too late So we need to move faster because we don't need any more prefab Condos that are going up that cost more than a single-family house and single-family houses people are desperate to get those in this city So, I don't know why we want to knock them down Thank you</p>

    <p>[pHtJcMxcqAQ_SPEAKER_25]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5120.378s">Sharon</a>  Guzik, 10 Manning Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5124.2s">Unfortunately,</a>  I'm just going to repeat a lot of what everybody else said, but I'll try to make that fast. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5130.543s">And</a>  I'm going to try to add some color. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5133.685s">I</a>  happen to live in the neighborhood that Bob Penta mentioned, which has had developers, specific developer that has come in and discovered <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5148.451s">The</a>  neighborhoods ripe for the picking and the points that were being made about losing open space because you can build more than one house on that lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5163.454s">and</a>  losing historic trees, which I'm sure you're all familiar with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5169.78s">Those</a>  pieces don't actually speak to the resolution that Brianna put forward, but they are important to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5179.087s">And</a>  as you heard with 21 Turo Ave, they have <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5185.725s">You</a>  know, by making it a historic district, we have, as a city, have some control over what happens to that whole piece of property, the lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5196.852s">We</a>  can't do that for every house, obviously, but we can tighten the demolition regulations, ordinances, and give the Medford Historical Commission the tools it needs, tools with teeth, <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5215.667s">And</a>  I would strongly suggest that you go for the 24-month delay, because you have to give people pause, or they are going to come in and just wait out the six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5230.391s">Even</a>  if you make it 12 months, they'll wait out the 12 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5233.832s">It</a>  has to be long enough that somebody that's coming in and looking to, as I think it was Gene said, <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5244.112s">that</a>  she calls it flipping. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5246.274s">They're</a>  looking to get a property, demolish what's on it, subdivide it, and build whatever they can. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5254.381s">In</a>  my neighborhood, as I said, the character has been changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5259.62s">by</a>  one developer single-handedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5262.361s">We've</a>  gotten a prefab duplex next to grandfather's house on South Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5269.484s">A</a>  large tree that had to be 150 years old was cut down to make way for another <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5278.708s">prefab</a>  two family, a house on Summer Street and another large beech tree were demolished and cut down to make way for yet another prefab duplex. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5292.2s">And</a>  now there's another house being threatened with demolition, a gorgeous, well, it could use a little, <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5302.268s">TLC</a>  on the outside, but you can see it has great bones. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5304.91s">It's</a>  a gorgeous, large, Queen Anne-style house. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5308.432s">Probably,</a>  I'm just guessing, I don't know, but from the 1890s era, it has a large lot, and it's very tempting. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5322.58s">We</a>  could lose this house in short order. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5329.304s">As</a>  you heard, <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5330.934s">The</a>  developer's already applied for a demo permit, even though he doesn't technically own the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5338.76s">So</a>  he's already got the process started. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5342.683s">I</a>  don't know if there's any way we can impose a moratorium on these things happening at this point while you guys sort out whether you're going to vote for 18 or 24 months for a demo delay. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5359.678s">It</a>  just breaks my heart. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5361.038s">I'm</a>  just seeing the character of my neighborhood with all its, I call them historic houses because they're older than a hundred years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5371.142s">It</a>  being, you know, okay, I get too emotional about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5376.864s">And</a>  as somebody else pointed out, it's fallen to the citizens, the neighbors on those streets to organize and try to fight for keeping those houses, keeping that green space open. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5390.045s">And</a>  in most cases, it's unsuccessful. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5397.909s">The</a>  one good spot was 21 Turo, where Tufts wanted to do the right thing by the neighborhood and found a couple that wanted to live in a historic house and bring it back, restore it to its former glory. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5413.577s">And</a>  they've done a very nice job. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5417.205s">So</a>  I just wanted to emphasize that time is of utmost importance. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5423.429s">We</a>  have to get this done if we're going to save the character of our neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5428.031s">Right</a>  now, we're allowing developers to come in and decide what we want our neighborhoods to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5437.908s">We</a>  have no, as citizens, we have no recourse. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5440.59s">We</a>  need to give the tools to the historical commission to save our historic houses. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5447.915s">And</a>  you know, and Doug mentioned the other pieces that need to also be in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5452.779s">Um,</a>  I know that's not before you now, but you should keep it in your head and you know, work on those things as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5462.306s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5465.65s">Yeah,</a>  I made so many notes, I don't know what I was saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5471.994s">Anyway,</a>  I'll just stop there and thank you so much for listening to me ramble.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5601.501s">Mr.</a>  McKillop, the council doesn't make the determination as to whether or not the home is historic. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5605.302s">The</a>  commission does that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5606.492s">So</a>  all we're doing is giving them the right development.</p>

    <p>[McKillop]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5608.253s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5608.493s">But</a>  if we put it to the point at the hands of the commission, how many homes in the city after 75, 90 years, how many homes become historical homes?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5616.638s">A</a>  very good question.</p>

    <p>[McKillop]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5618.419s">That's</a>  the point I'm trying to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5619.54s">At</a>  one point, the entire city becomes locked. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5623.282s">And</a>  that's what we have to consider. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5624.943s">So</a>  again, painting a clear kind of balanced picture, I think that going in the direction of trying to preserve historical homes 100 years past is an incredibly important thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5636.54s">Excuse</a>  me, Mr. Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5637.44s">Could</a>  we have quiet in the back there? <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5638.62s">Respect</a>  the gentleman at the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5640.581s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5642.261s">I</a>  apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5643.462s">That's</a>  quite all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5644.102s">I</a>  mean, opinions are very welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5646.622s">But</a>  we have to consider every aspect. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5648.243s">And</a>  I think that going through this process and finding the right way to make this work for everyone is the best way to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5654.404s">Because</a>  again, let's take a look at another example. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5657.365s">A</a>  family has a home <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5659.385s">passed</a>  down generation after generation. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5661.286s">The</a>  family has increased in size. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5662.867s">The</a>  family is no longer in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5664.909s">And</a>  the last remaining people in that home have passed away. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5668.751s">Now</a>  the family wants to sell that home. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5670.372s">A</a>  developer happens to come in and wants to purchase that home. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5674.975s">Are</a>  you saying to that family they cannot maximize their potential because it is a historical home? <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5681.059s">What</a>  is it we're trying to tell the taxpayers? <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5684.842s">So</a>  there's two sides to the coin that have to be considered. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5688.764s">And</a>  not that I'm against everything that's been spoken about tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5691.906s">I'm</a>  100% for it because I think there's some incredibly beautiful homes in this town that have to be preserved. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5698.73s">But</a>  there are two sides to the coin that have to be looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5701.652s">And</a>  that's the obligation of everyone to look at that and protect everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5706.394s">So</a>  it's going to be a challenge to find the best way to come across with this and to find the best rules to make that happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5712.958s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=5713.579s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=6323.93s">Also</a>  nice, the council rules state that paper that met in subcommittee cannot be reported out of subcommittee until the committee of the whole meets and it's presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=6330.876s">So</a>  that paper would have to be presented to the committee of the whole in order to be reported out of the committee of the whole and reach the floor pursuant to our rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=6337.503s">But</a>  we have Councilor Lungo's paper that's in front of us that we can amend. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=6340.565s">That</a>  was the theory that I was going with when I made the amendment to the piece of paper.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7062.072s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7064.536s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7066.538s">As</a>  I mentioned earlier, we are in the midst of a street-sweeping initiative that's going on currently right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7074.346s">And</a>  it has been stated in the past by myself and many members of this council that this particular program that we have right now is just a shell of a program. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7086.635s">And</a>  it's existed that way for a number of years, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7090.702s">And</a>  the reason why I bring this up is the fact that right now, in my opinion, the city is not giving proper notification to residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7099.562s">regarding</a>  when street sweeping will take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7102.745s">I've</a>  recommended in the past, and we'll do so again tonight, that the city embark upon creating permanent signage indicating the date and time of sweeping on every road in the city, Mr. President, which provides residents with notification. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7119.818s">It</a>  allows residents to know of a recurring patent of when streets will be swept, and it allows residents to plan ahead <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7129.64s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7130.962s">So</a>  permanent signage will accomplish the notification and the planning ahead of residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7137.773s">Also,</a>  Mr. President, as I've offered in the past, staggering parking on streets, whether it's odd or even parking during street sweeping, allows residents in those areas that are congested to, that don't have access to a driveway or to put their car somewhere, it'll allow them to park on one side of the street, similar to what we do in snow emergencies. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7161.303s">And</a>  then we can sweep on one side and then on the other side, Mr. President, allowing residents <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7168.221s">ample</a>  opportunity to park their cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7171.51s">on</a>  either the odd or even side. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7173.351s">I</a>  would ask that this recommendation or these recommendations be sent to the Public Works Subcommittee for full recommendations on the creation of a street sweeping program. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7185.875s">This</a>  is not the first time I've asked that we take a long and hard look at how we operate and do business in this community, in particular regarding street sweeping. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7196.299s">The</a>  fact we only sweep our streets twice a year <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7201.3s">You</a>  know, street sweeping accomplishes a number of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7204.301s">It</a>  keeps our roads clean, but it also keeps the debris and clutter from going into our catch basins, which create flooding if they get filled up, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7215.124s">So</a>  this is a very important initiative that, for some reason, this city has been lax on creating an effective policy of notification and permanent signage. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7226.846s">And</a>  I think it's long overdue, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7229.762s">If</a>  need be, if the city administration feels to act upon these recommendations like they've done in the past, I would recommend that the city council, and in particular the public works committee, create a city ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7243.207s">Because</a>  it seems to me that the policy of street sweeping, which is created by the administration, is no longer effective in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7251.369s">When</a>  you see cars that are being tagged and towed, you know, and many of which do not receive <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7259.672s">the</a>  notification from the reverse 9-1-1. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7261.573s">I</a>  think it's a shame, Mr. President, in this day and age, to hit residents up with a $175 bill before they even start their day off, if they're able to start their day off after their car gets towed. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7278.263s">So</a>  I would offer that in the form of a motion, Mr. President, that this be sent to the Public Works Subcommittee to review permanent signage with dates and times and a recurring <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7290.368s">on</a>  when our streets will be swept and also to stagger the parking by odd even allowing residents in congested areas to park on the streets during street sweeping. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7302.234s">Thank</a>  you Mr. Vice President.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7493.811s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7494.912s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7496.152s">This</a>  is a topic that's not new to anybody behind this rail, um, especially during this time of year. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7501.134s">And,</a>  um, one of the items that I see in terms of street sweeping in general, that's lacking in the community is, um, our public utilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7507.797s">And</a>  when we issue permits to our public utilities to tear up our streets and they do it, <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7512.102s">And</a>  then they decide to come back whenever they feel like coming back to repair our streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7515.786s">And</a>  then they leave the streets still looking in an awful situation, an awful mess with sand, with gravel, with dirt all over the place. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7522.634s">I</a>  don't believe that public utilities are required as part of the permitting process when they open up our streets to perform a sweep when they're done. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7529.782s">And</a>  I think that that's something that we should also look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7531.724s">Mr.</a>  President, I'd like to amend the paper to reflect that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7534.78s">I'd</a>  also, as the chairman of the DPW subcommittee, would request that any of my colleagues behind this rail send out an email to the members of the subcommittee with any suggestions that they'd like to see, and we can get to the table and discuss these issues.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7546.025s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7593.017s">Many</a>  of the main streets are done on a daily basis.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7595.72s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7597.102s">So</a>  we can continue to work on this and I think the idea of an ordinance is a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7602.227s">I</a>  think it's a good idea.</p>

    <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7608.833s">Hi,</a>  I'm Cheryl Rodriguez. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7610.014s">I</a>  live at 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7611.455s">My</a>  street is designated as a main artery. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7614.458s">So</a>  I think we have the street cleaning is supposed to commence in April and begin end on October 30th. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7622.805s">I</a>  hope that part of the discussion will include the main arteries because what we really need on those arteries is enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7629.271s">I</a>  like Councilor Dela Rousseau get the <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7632.565s">One</a>  to two a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7633.466s">Wake</a>  up call now twice a week for the street cleaners coming in the middle of the night. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7637.508s">But</a>  I often look out the window and note that even though one night is odd and one night is even, the street cleaner has to go around a car. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7644.372s">So</a>  if there's no enforcement, then those roads aren't actually getting cleaned. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7647.794s">And</a>  my husband will go out the next day with the shovel and pick up the debris on the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7652.417s">broken</a>  glass and such, that hasn't been picked up by the street cleaner because someone is parked in front of our house. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7657.861s">So</a>  that's important as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7659.762s">Also,</a>  when you do the clean sweep in the fall, because street cleaning on the main arteries has ended, we don't get street cleaning after October 30th, so all the leaves are in the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7670.73s">And</a>  the neighbors will go out and take care of those as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7673.512s">So</a>  if we're not going to have enforcement, then increased street cleaning is not going to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7677.194s">I</a>  know that the police are taxed, but that should be something that is included in the conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7681.917s">Because</a>  even though we have the signs on our street every 10 to 20 feet, there's a sign that says move on Wednesday night, move on Thursday night, the cars are not moving and nothing's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7691.322s">The</a>  street cleaners are just going around them. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7693.423s">So</a>  that's not really useful for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7696.265s">I</a>  do hope that it will do more street cleaning. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7698.146s">My</a>  father lives on Garfield Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=7699.908s">and</a>  he's frequently cleaning out the catch basins because they don't get the regular cleaning.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8110.496s">Councilor</a>  Knight, you will help me. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8112.017s">The</a>  city's ordinance is rather specific in detail in terms of the procedure and the processes. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8117.164s">that</a>  take place on how an applicant can move forward and request whether or not they have a funding opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8122.868s">And</a>  there are also certain restrictions that are placed around who would be a qualified and eligible applicant.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8257.419s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8258.88s">I</a>  am not opposed to this particular paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8261.963s">I</a>  think it's long overdue to have equipment in the Registrar of Voters Office as well on election day that properly reflects the will of the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8274.393s">And</a>  I think equipment is needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8276.555s">I</a>  do, Mr. President, have to say that <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8280.93s">This</a>  council has voted unanimously on at least three different occasions requesting that our brave men and women of the fire department receive the two extractors, which are washing machines on steroids, Mr. President, and two dryers to clean their turnout gear. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8300.783s">As</a>  I mentioned several weeks ago when I made a presentation before this council that it was unanimously supported, <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8307.677s">I</a>  requested that the administration look into buying two more washes because currently, right now, many of the brave men and women of our fire department are using turnout gear that is potentially in a fire and contaminates on the turnout gear that's leaching into our firefighters' skins, Mr. President, and could be causing risk of cancer. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8334.947s">I've</a>  asked this on several occasions. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8336.628s">The</a>  administration said that they were looking into grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8339.83s">I</a>  did talk to Bill O'Brien, the union president, and he mentioned they are pursuing a grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8346.618s">right</a>  now for two washes and two dries that will be located at the firefighter headquarters on Main Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8356.682s">And</a>  if the grant comes through, fine, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8360.584s">There's</a>  nothing that precludes this council from allotting $29,700. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8364.245s">That's</a>  what it's going to take to assure our men and women in the fire department have the proper equipment to wash their gear, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8375.41s">That's</a>  all it's going to take, $29,700. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8378.291s">And</a>  if the grant comes through, Mr. President, that grant will pay back the money that was taken out of the free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8386.593s">So</a>  I would respectfully ask, Mr. President, as part of this paper, there'd be a B paper requesting that the mayor appropriate $29,700 to pay for two washing machines, which are two extractors and two dryers, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8404.553s">for</a>  the fire department, which has been unanimously supported by this council.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8410.601s">So</a>  I would ask that as a big paper, as part of this paper, Mr. President may also point out that it was, uh, uh, reported to us that these new <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8422.75s">polling</a>  machines, Mr. President, these new election machines, uh, will not be subject to, uh, undue interference from, uh, foreign powers, whether they be Eastern European or Asian or anywhere else. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8438.597s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8439.057s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo.</p>

<a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8618.145s">Last</a>  week. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8618.505s">Last</a>  week. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8618.705s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8620.245s">And</a>  this council voted to set up a Committee of the Whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8624.906s">That's</a>  correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8625.486s">Which</a>  I believe is going to take place May 2nd. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8627.687s">May</a>  2nd. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8628.527s">May</a>  2nd. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8629.107s">And</a>  I want to thank you for your quick response on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8631.287s">You're</a>  welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8632.347s">This</a>  is a really important issue that's impacting <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8636.104s">every</a>  resident in this community that pays a water and sewer bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8642.489s">I</a>  received additional information, and that's why I'm bringing it up tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8646.572s">I</a>  received a letter dated November 17, 2015, regarding Medford Water and Sewer Commissioners. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8654.979s">And</a>  the letter goes on to state, Mr. President, that the Water and Sewer Commissioners voted to create what they refer to as <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8665.41s">a</a>  baseline charge on everyone's water and sewer bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8670.495s">When</a>  I read on, Mr. President, they refer to it as, which I referred to it last week, as a connectivity charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8677.522s">And</a>  the way I understand it is every resident will receive this additional charge on a bimonthly basis starting in August 1st, 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8690.638s">And</a>  the reason that I got for the implementation of this connectivity charge is that it will pay for infrastructure improvements and other water and sewer necessities. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8704.682s">We</a>  all know right now there's over $8 million in the water and sewer enterprise account in surplus funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8711.467s">And</a>  that money, by state law, is earmarked to not only reduce the rate, if need be, but also for infrastructure improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8721.314s">And</a>  it can only be spent on infrastructure improvements or reduction in water and sewer rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8728.82s">And</a>  this particular charge, in my opinion, is nothing more than an additional surcharge on the ratepayers of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8736.965s">And</a>  the additional information I did receive <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8739.706s">And</a>  I can let my colleagues see it, or I can make a copy for May 2nd, is that they actually went as far as breaking down the additional charge by the size of the water pipe that comes into your house. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8754.67s">And</a>  most people in this community, in the residential areas, have a five-eighths pipe that comes into the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8763.535s">And</a>  that additional connectivity charge will be $9.47 bi-monthly, which is six times. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8773.061s">So</a>  it's roughly $60 additional a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8776.583s">It</a>  may not sound like a lot, but you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8779.225s">When</a>  you have an $8 million surplus of ratepayer money, <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8783.394s">sitting</a>  in an account. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8784.858s">That's</a>  a lot of money to additionally request, Mr. President, and also request it based on the fact that it's for infrastructure improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8795.465s">And</a>  that's the money we're already collecting. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8797.326s">And</a>  we already have a surplus. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8799.187s">As</a>  part of the bill we currently pay right now, it goes to your water. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8803.07s">It</a>  goes to delivery. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8804.451s">It</a>  goes for the maintenance of the pipes. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8806.312s">It</a>  goes for the workers within the city of Medford that are in the water and sewer department. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8811.875s">So</a>  that's already built into the rate structure. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8814.517s">This</a>  is an added cost that I am adamantly opposed to, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8819.541s">I</a>  need to say, I find it ironic, Mr. President, that the Water and Sewer Commission would take a vote or be presented with a proposal in November of 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8837.019s">And</a>  then the city administration sit on it, not till last year when we had a mayor race. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8843.382s">They</a>  didn't touch it then. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8846.424s">Not</a>  this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8848.545s">I</a>  mean, last year was an off year. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8853.167s">To</a>  not sit on it during the mayor race, which was in 2015, sit on it in 2016, the first term of the new mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8862.192s">No,</a>  didn't want any increases then. 2017. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8866.523s">New</a>  May is up for reelection. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8868.104s">Let's</a>  sit on it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8869.224s">2018</a>  sounds like a great time. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8872.745s">Let's</a>  do it in August of 2018 when everyone's vacationing and not paying attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8878.347s">That</a>  sounds like a great time to implement something almost three years after the fact, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8885.51s">I</a>  really would like to hear from the administration to explain why this is being rolled out in August of 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8893.113s">What's</a>  the reasoning behind it? <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8895.114s">Also,</a>  Mr. President, you know, I mentioned $60, and people at home may say, ah, $60, that's not too much. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8902.636s">That's</a>  $1.5 million they're going to raise from roughly a $60 surcharge. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8909.558s">Now,</a>  not everyone has a 5-8 pipe coming into their home. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8913.799s">We</a>  have condos associations that may have an inch pipe, a two-inch pipe. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8918.961s">Their</a>  bill will be $75 bimonthly. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8924.682s">You</a>  go up further to some of the larger corporations in our city that may have a six or 10-inch pipe. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8930.804s">A</a>  10-inch pipe, Mr. President, coming in, that's $1,087 bimonthly. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8937.405s">That's</a>  $6,000 additional charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8941.126s">Now,</a>  I don't know what businesses or how many have a 10-inch pipe. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8945.132s">or</a>  a six-inch water pipe, which is $472. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8949.075s">But</a>  all I can tell you, Mr. President, there's nothing worse than a hidden charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8953.998s">You</a>  know, we've been paying for the last three or four years a franchise fee to get local access cable. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8962.444s">Local</a>  access cable, Mr. President, we've all been paying, and we haven't received local access cable in almost four years. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8970.93s">And</a>  I stand to be corrected, it may even be longer than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8974.82s">So</a>  all these little additional fees that are out there, Mr. President, do add up. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8979.842s">Do</a>  add up to the senior citizens on a fixed income that can't afford an additional penny on their bill, let alone another $60 for a charge, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8989.946s">They're</a>  already charging us. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8991.746s">You</a>  already have $8 million of the taxpayers' money, Mr. President, in an account. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8997.348s">What</a>  more do you want? <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=8999.149s">What</a>  more do you want from the ratepayers? <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9001.69s">It's</a>  easy picking. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9003.191s">That's</a>  what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9003.872s">It's</a>  easy picking, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9006.554s">So</a>  I would ask, Mr. President, that when we meet with the Water and Sewer Commission on May 2nd, that the administration is also represented and also that Ron Baker, which I mentioned, I'm not sure if you added him, <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9021.367s">to</a>  the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9022.047s">He's</a>  on the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9022.907s">He's</a>  on the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9023.888s">So</a>  we can have a thorough explanation on, not only from the Water and Sewer Commissioners, from the city administration, who's been sitting on this for several years now, for the opportune time to present it when no one's paying attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9036.811s">That's</a>  what this boils down to.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9038.312s">We</a>  can put that question forward so we'll have that information for that meeting.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9041.733s">I'd</a>  like to hear it from the horse's mouth, instead of from the other end. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9045.754s">I'd</a>  like to hear it from the horse's mouth.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9046.974s">We</a>  will invite the administration to the meeting.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9048.734s">OK,</a>  I'd appreciate that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9050.155s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9050.635s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9052.054s">Councilor</a>  Doroso. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9053.375s">Mr.</a>  President, I, too, look forward to hearing more about this from the city administration, members of the Water and Sewer Commission, and the appropriate parties who are able to present to us factual information, which I look forward to. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9071.491s">And</a>  I thank you in advance for your leadership in the matter, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9076.796s">Councilor</a>  Lococo. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9078.157s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9079.718s">I</a>  just want to thank Councilor Marks for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9082.239s">I</a>  was unaware. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9084.601s">I</a>  don't know how you got the information. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9086.422s">If</a>  you could provide us with that information, maybe by email before the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9089.984s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9092.986s">Yeah,</a>  I'm just glad it's been brought to our attention before they roll it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9098.569s">Come</a>  August 2018, I definitely am in agreement with Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9103.532s">We</a>  already overtaxed the taxpayer. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9106.105s">the</a>  ratepayers, and now, you know, any additional fees or charges. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9110.929s">It</a>  does hurt a lot of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9112.39s">Some</a>  people can afford it, but a lot of people can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9114.932s">And</a>  those are the people that we hear from. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9116.413s">So</a>  I'm glad. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9117.734s">Thank</a>  you for setting up a meeting, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9120.096s">And</a>  I look forward to getting some answers and hopefully making some changes to the potential possibility.</p>

May 2nd, voice your concerns that night. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9278.172s">I'm</a>  voicing them here and now, too, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9280.053s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9280.493s">It's</a>  outrageous. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9281.294s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9281.514s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[McKillop]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9314.007s">David</a>  McKillop, 94 Rockland Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9316.789s">Uh,</a>  I live up in an area called the heights. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9319.13s">I'm</a>  sure most people are familiar with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9320.931s">One</a>  of the things about the heights that's very unique is our water pressure. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9325.604s">I</a>  had the rare opportunity of sitting across at one of the mayor's meet and greets, the commissioner of the water and sewer, and asked him, has that area of Medford ever been reviewed? <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9338.76s">Because</a>  the water pressure is <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9340.692s">It's</a>  sometimes so horrific that if I'm taking a shower and my neighbor waters their lawn, I guess I'm taking a cold shower or a very little one or a very fast one. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9351.479s">And</a>  his response to me was, oh, yeah, it's reviewed all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9354.561s">And</a>  it's a very costly review to process. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9358.923s">And</a>  how long ago, my question was, was that reviewed? <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9362.345s">Oh,</a>  many, many years ago, but we look at it all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9365.227s">So</a>  my question is, how can we have an $8 million surplus <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9370.373s">and</a>  have areas of the city that have a deficit when it comes to things that need to be looked at, repaired, fixed, replaced, changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9378.056s">I</a>  know I'm on a five-eighths piping. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9381.898s">Part</a>  of that is so the pressure can kind of maintain a certain level. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9385.7s">But</a>  really, seriously, it's just ironic that we would ask for an additional $1.45 million a year to add what, to the surplus? <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9396.185s">I'm</a>  confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9397.425s">And</a>  the other thing I really kind of <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9400.144s">me</a>  being mathematical, I take 8 million and 9 million and that's 17 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9404.187s">And</a>  isn't that pretty close to what we need for a police department, fire department? <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9409.471s">Just</a>  throwing it out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9410.812s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9411.773s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9414.375s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9416.096s">Robert</a>  Penta zero summit road method. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9417.858s">Mass</a>  former member of the sport. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9419.559s">The</a>  path is kind of ironic about this is your projected rates this year for your water and sewer are being reduced by approximately 2.77%. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9428.356s">So</a>  if the Water and Sewer Commission has given you a 2.77 projected rate decrease for combined water and sewer, and as you said, Councilor Marks, they're sitting on $8.5 million in the surplus, why would they now want to go out and hit you with a connectivity fee on a quarterly basis? <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9445.264s">And</a>  if you check any cities and towns, most of them that have a connectivity fee, it's a one-time fee, and that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9453.508s">And</a>  it's at the discretion of the Director of Public Works or the town administrator <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9457.603s">If</a>  you are a present homeowner landowner and you need to be reconnected, there is no charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9464.027s">It</a>  would be for a brand new person coming in, building a house first time around $50 one time fee.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9515.808s">The</a>  point of order is talking about how this council is going to react. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9520.183s">with</a>  the rate increase of a connectivity fee that you're going to be putting on the taxpayers if it comes to be presented before you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9526.244s">I</a>  don't think you need to wait until May 2nd. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9528.725s">I</a>  think your vote should take place here tonight that you're not going to approve it, and you're not going to be supportive of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9534.706s">We</a>  have a meeting on May 2nd. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9536.166s">Mr.</a>  President, you have an $8.5 million surplus, and you have a projected rate decrease in your water and sewer rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9543.087s">Now,</a>  you go out and explain that to the ratepayer of this community.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9839.267s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9841.208s">Being</a>  a father of children with allergies and understanding the severity thereof in looking at <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9848.777s">the</a>  past few weeks, what's going on in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9851.62s">We</a>  have first responders whose job is to save people's lives, carrying Narcan. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9858.108s">We</a>  have our first responders right now reviewing a request that this council made to have defibrillators as part of their first response packets. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9869.72s">And</a>  this is an effort to build upon that, Mr. President, and to ask the administration to examine the feasibility of requiring EpiPens and EpiPen training for our first responders. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9878.867s">As</a>  we all know, when you come into a situation related to allergies, every second counts. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9883.611s">And</a>  most times the police cars get there before the ambulances do. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9887.273s">And</a>  if, in fact, there's a feasible way to provide this training and this product to our <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9893.87s">First</a>  responders, I think, will be making Medford a safer place. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9896.791s">And</a>  I don't think there's anybody behind this rail that can argue that our first job isn't to have a focus on public safety, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9903.013s">We're</a>  making great strides in that regard. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9905.955s">And</a>  I think that this is just an opportunity for us to expand upon the services that we provide our citizenry. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9910.476s">And</a>  I'd ask that my colleagues behind the rail support this measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9913.297s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9914.598s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Kurin. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9916.699s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9918.079s">I</a>  want to thank Councilor <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9921.287s">Knight,</a>  for bringing this forward, I actually saw it on the news. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9924.748s">A</a>  young child from Walpole was being rushed to the hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9928.67s">Oh,</a>  no, actually, maybe that's where you got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9933.652s">EMT</a>  came and saved his life with an EpiPen. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9936.153s">And</a>  they said, thank God the EMTs got there. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9938.754s">We're</a>  the first responders. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9940.134s">And</a>  it's a big push by a woman in Walpole. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9942.915s">I</a>  think she's getting help by a couple of state representatives in that area to change the law of the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9950.003s">but</a>  I think this is a great resolve put forward by Councilor Knight to implement it in Medford sooner than later. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9957.909s">So</a>  many children and adults and anybody any age have these allergies where EpiPens are being more and more administered and needed and I think if somebody can save a life of somebody who's going into anaphylactic shock, it's going <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9975.612s">I</a>  know there's going to have to be training that's going to need to be need to take place, but it's going to be worth it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9980.816s">So</a>  I second the resolve.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9982.498s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9984.559s">Also,</a>  Mr. President, I know we've all seen in the news the drastic price increases of EpiPens and individuals that are on fixed incomes may have a little bit of a difficult time purchasing these materials, especially if they're without insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=9999.592s">So</a>  one of my fears is that individuals that <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10003.841s">You</a>  know, I have allergies that require an EpiPen when they have a reaction. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10008.144s">I'm</a>  going to use that as an area to save costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10011.306s">And</a>  if someone's trying to trim their budget and they haven't used their EpiPen in two or three years and it's expired, they might say, well, I'm pretty good at watching the nuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10018.451s">I</a>  don't think I need it, which is going to create a worse situation, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10022.474s">So</a>  I, again, thank Councilor Longo for her kind words and move for approval.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10027.337s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10029.118s">And</a>  I have a grandson that has an allergy and <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10032.079s">EpiPens</a>  are $600 a piece and not covered by insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10036.263s">And</a>  he takes one to school, I have one at home, and my daughter is out $1,800 on three EpiPens that you only get a year on. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10044.67s">So,</a>  again, they are quite expensive and insurance should cover them, but they don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10050.695s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Knights, seconded by Councilor Lockern, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10057.261s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10060.487s">Petitions,</a>  excuse me, one more. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10064.948s">17369,</a>  offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved, the Board of Health examine the feasibility of establishing a grading system for establishments licensed to sell food products. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10078.15s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10079.27s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10081.211s">This</a>  is a program or a process or a policy that's in place in many communities around the United States of America. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10088.162s">think</a>  about the first time I saw it, I think I was in California when I saw this establishment has been rated a B plus by the Board of Health and its inspection. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10096.307s">There</a>  are other establishments that were seized and other establishments that were raised. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10099.869s">And</a>  what the Board of Health is doing is conducting their food inspections and then making an assessment based upon a certain policy or protocol they put in place to give a grade to that establishment with the hopes that it produces corrective action, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10113.622s">every</a>  food establishment here in the city of Medford meeting every requirement that the Board of Health puts forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10118.847s">So</a>  we'll see cities like New York City, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and most recently I believe the city of Boston adopted a system where they're grading establishments based upon the results of their food inspections. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10130.358s">And</a>  I think that this is really a great act to protect the consumer. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10135.339s">I</a>  don't want the policy to create an increased burden on operators or business owners here in the community, but I think that if we sell good products and the city is behind the fact that a business is selling a good product, that we'll have more customers in that business because the city and the government entity has made an effort to further regulate it and to make sure that they're complying by all the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10155.109s">And</a>  then we're telling people they're complying by the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10156.809s">So</a>  I know we have Mr. Pinter at the rail here. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10160.431s">I</a>  thought Mr. McKillop was going to get up because he's a <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10162.955s">He's</a>  a business owner and a restaurant owner. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10165.015s">However,</a>  this is a measure that I'd like to get a report back from the Board of Health on as to whether or not this is something that they find feasible and find out if it'll work in the city of Medford, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10173.857s">So</a>  I'd ask my colleagues to support it and move approval.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10176.098s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10177.418s">Robert</a>  Pantazero, Summit Road, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10179.718s">Number</a>  one, I would be opposed to this bill if I was sitting on that side of the rail, because number one, I think this is an infringement upon the free enterprise system. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10186.92s">The</a>  Board of Health has a job to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10189.04s">They</a>  go out there, they review the product of the restaurant, <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10192.74s">or</a>  whatever it might be, that's their job. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10194.722s">And</a>  for them to start taking an arbitrary and capricious action by placing a, A, B, or C on the type of business that's taking place, who are they? <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10202.91s">They</a>  don't frequent that business. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10204.132s">And</a>  I think it would lead a very, uh, it would, it would skew. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10208.953s">the</a>  public to go into a certain direction to say one business might be better than another. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10213.077s">You</a>  know, this is just as bad as municipal aggregation. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10216.82s">You</a>  know, you're asking city government to get involved in people's lives, their personal lives, and in this situation, their personal life is a personal business.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10227.11s">The</a>  proposal that's before us is for the Board of Health to examine whether or not this would be a feasible approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10232.706s">And</a>  what it is is not to have the Board of Health get involved into the business operations of a business, but to report to the general public that the facility that they're going to eat and purchase food from is clean. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10242.428s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10243.548s">When</a>  they go and do their job, and they review a restaurant, and they get a certificate on there that says it's been approved, whether it's a milk license, a common ventures license, or any kind of food product license, that's the city or the town telling you that that place has passed the test. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10257.951s">They</a>  don't need to have a rating system. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10261.08s">When</a>  you start getting into a rating system, well, maybe we should have departments come down here and rate you guys and girls on the performance of your jobs, OK? <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10269.223s">You're</a>  really crossing over the line on something like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10272.525s">You</a>  have a department that does its job. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10274.746s">And</a>  its job is to go out there and to ensure that the food product in a business is safe, it's good to eat, <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10282.92s">And</a>  so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10284.041s">And</a>  now if you're going to start putting a rating system on it, I think you're really crossing over the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10288.123s">You</a>  know, people spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to go into a food business. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10293.405s">And</a>  if that person upstairs, man or female, who happens to work for the health department, just doesn't <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10298.708s">They</a>  might pass the test, but they may not like the person. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10301.852s">You're</a>  getting into a personality conflict. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10303.874s">How</a>  many times have you folks gotten phone calls from people that have a business because they don't like a department head that comes in there and gives them a hard time? <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10313.464s">And</a>  it's a personality conflict. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10315.146s">It's</a>  got nothing to do with the business. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10317.168s">I</a>  would strongly suggest that this does not go forward and you leave it just the way it is as a private sector business person coming to the city and applying for their license. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10326.494s">However</a>  it is, they go there, they do their job, but their business takes care of itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10330.597s">Their</a>  product sold to the public will take care of itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10333.719s">We</a>  don't need any city administration telling a business person that owns a restaurant how they should be rated by this city.</p>

<a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10434.125s">Should</a>  we step up to the plate and do something a little bit different because it's not quite working the way we'd like to based off of the information we have? <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10441.29s">That's</a>  kind of the way I personally would approach it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10444.993s">If</a>  I remember correctly, the grading method was based or actually came about <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10452.105s">do</a>  specifically because of the chain businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10456.35s">Because</a>  the chain businesses were the ones that were having a real difficult time staying on top of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10461.596s">Because</a>  when you go to franchises or you go to district managers, regional managers, then store managers, then assistant managers, <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10468.201s">It's</a>  very, very difficult to kind of maintain a certain level of control. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10471.424s">And</a>  that's kind of where that kind of came from and morphed out of. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10474.367s">And</a>  then it kind of blanketed across and kind of kept going further. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10477.49s">And</a>  to be honest with you too, Mr. Penta's point, there are some areas that it does not work well, that it is kind of a negative kind of, <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10489.412s">reciprocation</a>  on the behalf of someone that may not appreciate someone else and, you know, gives them a bad score just simply because they can. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10496.819s">So</a>  it is a double-edged, it can be a double-edged sword, but I think that any community that works with the Board of Health, the restaurateurs, they recognize how important it is, and the Board of Health, if they do it well, and I know in my community they do it very well, <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10512.894s">They</a>  work in tandem, and they work really, really hard together to make sure that everything is the way it's supposed to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10517.437s">So</a>  that's the only input I can give on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10520.379s">I</a>  don't have an opinion one way or the other as to which direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10523.941s">I</a>  just say, basically, collect all your data. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10527.223s">Take</a>  a look at your Board of Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10528.424s">And</a>  by the way, if I'm not mistaken, the Board of Health is really, it is a department within the city, but it's underneath the umbrella of the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10535.989s">Am</a>  I right or wrong? <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10537.71s">I</a>  think in the city of Salem, that's the way that they present it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10543.054s">Okay,</a>  just for clarification, because I wasn't quite sure, because I know that in the City of Salem, they kind of make it as the Board of Health is kind of their own entity within the city working underneath the state, no? <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10554.44s">Okay,</a>  so maybe that's not the one.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10559.903s">There's</a>  a lot of things that are governed through state legislation. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10563.773s">eliminates</a>  local control. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10565.173s">So</a>  the answer to that is yes and no, I guess.</p>

    <p>[McKillop]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10568.574s">That's</a>  kind of the way, the approach I would make. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10570.435s">And</a>  you do have to be careful when anything, anything has to do with something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10574.096s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10575.076s">Thank</a>  you for your retreat. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10575.816s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Coats. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10576.977s">Sorry</a>  to.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10578.637s">Vice</a>  president of box. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10580.598s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10581.978s">I</a>  believe it was about six months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10583.698s">Uh,</a>  during the council meeting, uh, we had the new border health inspector, uh, before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10590.78s">And</a>  I asked the new health director, <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10594.178s">uh,</a>  where do we stand with, um, border health inspections? <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10599.9s">And</a>  I believe they were seven or eight months behind. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10603.921s">And</a>  the reason why I knew that is because I had a number of businesses that said, what do I do? <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10608.962s">My</a>  board, my health inspection ran out six months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10613.323s">Can</a>  I still operate my business? <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10615.484s">And</a>  that's why I asked the question, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10618.245s">And</a>  you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10619.445s">I</a>  think the larger question is, what are we doing right now? <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10622.888s">Are</a>  we up to date with our health inspections? <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10625.689s">Do</a>  we need more staff in the office? <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10628.231s">To</a>  me, that's the larger question. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10630.353s">If</a>  we want to create a rating system, which I'll be quite honest with you, I don't know if I'm opposed or not to it, but if we want to create a rating system, that's to make sure at least we're doing our due diligence <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10641.52s">and</a>  making sure we have the appropriate staff and making sure our business has their inspections in a timely fashion so they don't have to wonder whether or not they have to close their door because they don't have a border health inspection. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10655.137s">So</a>  I think that's the larger issue, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10658.2s">I'm</a>  not willing to vote on any paper tonight to move any issue forward, Mr. President, until we find out where we stand with the Board of Health, where we stand on with the inspections, and why is it taking so long for our health department to inspect these businesses in the community, because as we all know, as Councilor Penta mentioned, <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10678.718s">that</a>  the Board of Health goes out there and makes sure that the businesses are adhering to code, state and city safety codes. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10687.502s">That's</a>  what their business is. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10688.842s">And</a>  when you get your inspection sticker, that means you're up to par. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10692.344s">And</a>  that means the resident that's going into your restaurant knows your food is prepared in the right way, know that your preparation is right, know the heating requirements and refrigeration requirements are right, and all the cleanliness stuff that goes with <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10707.703s">a</a>  border health inspection. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10710.184s">So</a>  that is important, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10713.345s">At</a>  this point, grading a business, I think we've got to go back to fundamentals in this city and making sure we provide the basics, which is a timely border health inspection for all our businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10726.63s">So</a>  I'd like to see that happen first, Mr. President, before I vote on- Would you like to amend the paper to-</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10733.725s">get</a>  a report from the Board of Health on where we stand with all the inspections in the city?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10739.927s">We</a>  asked for it, and I believe she gave us a verbal at the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10743.567s">And</a>  honestly, I don't remember the exacts, but I want to say that 30 or 40% of our businesses back some six months ago didn't receive their Board of Health inspection, and they were in the process of doing so.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10755.65s">So</a>  if we could get an update, that'd be helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10757.29s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, if you could please put down that if the Board of Health can give us an update on <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10762.085s">and</a>  where we stand with businesses getting their license renewals. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10768.328s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Lococo.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10775.631s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10777.572s">I</a>  think it's a good discussion maybe we should have with the Board of Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10781.793s">Maybe</a>  we can do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10782.834s">Through</a>  a proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10784.835s">Well,</a>  through a proposal or we could just talk to the Board of Health at budget time, see where they're at. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10790.463s">kind</a>  of talk about everything at the same time, give it a little extra time with the Board of Health before we move on anything tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10797.227s">I</a>  mean, I see both sides. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10799.289s">I</a>  agree with Councilor Marks, but I understand the point of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10802.651s">So</a>  maybe just to have a discussion about it rather than, or definitely get some more clarity of what we're actually asking the Board of Health to report back to us on.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10814.919s">Councilor</a>  Nate.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10818.341s">The</a>  Board of Health could very simply say, <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10820.105s">It's</a>  not feasible. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10820.885s">We</a>  don't want to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10822.446s">It</a>  is feasible. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10823.047s">We</a>  can do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10824.047s">All</a>  we're doing is asking them a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10825.648s">I</a>  don't see the harm.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10827.349s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Knight as amended by Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10837.515s">If</a>  the Port of Health is going to put that little thought into it, then I don't even think it's worth asking the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10843.718s">If</a>  they sit back and say, well, we can't do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10846.579s">That's</a>  not even worth asking the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10848.34s">Or</a>  if they sit back and say, <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10849.599s">We</a>  can do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10850.7s">I'd</a>  like to know why they can do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10852.002s">I'd</a>  like to know if they have the personnel knowing the fact that they can't get to their regularly scheduled health visits now. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10858.93s">How</a>  are they going to be able to take this on? <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10861.152s">They're</a>  in a depleted staff up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10863.675s">So</a>  I think there's more to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10865.017s">I'm</a>  not saying it's not a bad idea, but I just think there's more to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10868.961s">And</a>  you know, if it comes from the council, <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10870.96s">And</a>  we're saying, will you look into this? <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10872.8s">Then</a>  it may mushroom into something else. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10875.541s">And</a>  we're going to be sitting there saying, wow, we didn't want you to go that far with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10880.182s">We</a>  didn't want you to move that far. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10882.242s">Because</a>  as far as I'm concerned, once this takes place, this will be an administrative policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10888.243s">I</a>  don't see this as a city ordinance, unless Councilor Knight sees it differently. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10892.264s">I</a>  see this as an administrative policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10894.585s">And</a>  that's not under our purview. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10896.645s">So</a>  we may initiate the ball rolling and not be able to stop that ball. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=10901.02s">And</a>  I'm not prepared to do that at this point, not knowing where we stand with the Board of Health presence in our community, the staffing, and the fact that they're not fully equipped to get out in a timely fashion for inspections.</p>

    <p>[Robert Cappucci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11003.154s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11004.514s">I'm</a>  Robert Capucci, Jr., 71 Evans Street in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11007.795s">I'll</a>  try to be brief at this late hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11010.975s">Last</a>  summer, it was proposed that the city move towards municipal aggregation based solely on it would save the electric rate payers in Medford some money. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11026.299s">It</a>  went away. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11027.46s">Somehow</a>  it came back last Tuesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11029.925s">in</a>  a committee of the whole meeting under a new auspice of protecting the environment, Go Green. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11038.331s">There</a>  was a wonderful presentation brought by the company, supposedly going to be hired by Alicia Hunt, the director of energy and environment here in Medford, the chairman of the Go Green Medford community. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11053.981s">Basically,</a>  for the citizens that are watching at home, <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11057.705s">It's</a>  a program whereby if passed, if it ever comes to a vote in this council and it does get passed, you're automatically opted into the city buying your power for you, your electricity, with the provision that you can opt out. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11074.497s">Understandably,</a>  what the company said last week was you can opt out at any time. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11079.316s">There</a>  was also a 30 day opt out clause in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11084.439s">But</a>  Councilor Marks at the committee of the whole meeting brought up the state law which is after 180 days you cannot opt out. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11093.325s">And</a>  getting into these government contracts doing things on behalf of the people, when they tell you, you know, we'll let you opt out at any time. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11102.871s">But</a>  the state losses something out. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11104.832s">I'm</a>  a little bit skeptical of the whole process I if they if this is really such a good thing They should present it and market it to the people as an as an opt-in if they want to not Force everybody all at once to be a part of this system. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11121.457s">I</a>  mean, that's a slippery slope. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11123.217s">Where</a>  does it end? <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11124.037s">Is</a>  the City Council gonna vote that? <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11128.066s">another</a>  company buys all my clothes from me, all my groceries. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11132.048s">It's,</a>  it's, it's, it's dangerous precedent that was sent setting. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11136.329s">It</a>  really is. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11137.33s">But</a>  I want to be fair to the other side. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11140.791s">Uh,</a>  Councilor Dello Russo at the committee of the whole meeting was a very astute and bringing up, I would like to hear opposition to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11147.954s">So</a>  I emailed everybody on this council, the citizens against municipal aggregation website. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11154.436s">I</a>  also included the mayor and, <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11156.861s">Alicia</a>  hunt, the director of environment and engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11160.183s">I'm</a>  also going to reach out to them if it ever does come to a vote so that the opposite side could be heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11166.726s">I</a>  just find it just comforting that the city would entertain the notion of doing something on behalf of every resident. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11178.453s">from</a>  reading the CAMA website, it doesn't always work. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11183.416s">And</a>  if you are locked into it, and they say you can get out, but on that 181st day, you do try to get out. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11189.499s">For</a>  some reason, you can't, and a lower rate comes. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11192.341s">I</a>  mean, you can go to the two sources now. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11195.202s">It's</a>  at Eversource and National Grid. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11197.603s">And</a>  you can click on them now. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11199.377s">And</a>  under those, a ton of other options come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11203.02s">There</a>  are choices for citizens to make right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11205.802s">They</a>  can enter into a six-month program for, say, $6.99 a kilowatt hour, or another program for $12.99. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11211.686s">That</a>  choice, which is pretty much the fundamental building block of this nation, should never be taken away. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11219.491s">Thank</a>  you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11220.712s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11223.634s">Motion</a>  by Councilor Knight to receive and Mr. President file. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11226.676s">Second.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11227.957s">On</a>  the same, Mr. President,</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11229.368s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11231.589s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11233.309s">And</a>  I thank Mr. Capucci for getting up on this subject. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11236.37s">I</a>  think he hit the nail on the head when it comes to this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11240.451s">Just</a>  so you know, the issue was referred to the energy subcommittee of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11248.433s">And</a>  we plan on having a meeting very shortly regarding this paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11253.855s">But</a>  I just want to let it be known, Mr. President, that the city has been going out on its own <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11258.897s">on</a>  the school side for a number of years, doing municipal aggregation on the school side. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11266.159s">And</a>  back in 2014, it was reported in the Medford transcript that, and the article reads, Medford Unplugs on electricity contract cost schools more than $100,000, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11280.148s">The</a>  city, when they went in and purchased on behalf of the schools, failed to renew the contract and had to go back out on the open market and wasn't able to obtain a rate like they had when they had a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11297.38s">And</a>  it ended up costing the schools, which is you and I the rate payer, $100,000 because they failed to do their job. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11306.627s">So</a>  after that glowing recommendation, now they say, you know what, let's do it on behalf of every resident in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11313.971s">Look</a>  at our track record. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11315.372s">Now</a>  we want to bring in every resident and we'll go out on your behalf. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11319.834s">Anytime</a>  the government wants to get involved in your business, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11323.876s">as</a>  far as I'm concerned, is not a win-win. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11326.657s">When</a>  the government says, we want to save you money, that should be the biggest red flag, because the government is not in business to save you or I money. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11336.6s">They're</a>  not in that business, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11338.941s">So</a>  this will get its proper hearing in the Energy Subcommittee, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11344.803s">But</a>  as far as I'm concerned, I agree with the Speaker. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11348.004s">When</a>  the state legislature created this, <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11350.466s">They</a>  created a clause where it says it's voluntary in the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11355.648s">This</a>  is voluntary. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11357.129s">However,</a>  once your city council votes for it, it's no longer voluntary. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11362.671s">Everyone</a>  is subjected to this new municipal aggregation. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11366.732s">Then</a>  you have the ability to opt out. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11369.654s">And</a>  we all know when we changed our meters over, it took us several years just to change our meters over in this city because people weren't properly informed. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11379.478s">And</a>  to say that, you know, there'll be community outreach and so forth, you know, they made a big mistake with the legislation. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11386.062s">They</a>  should have had it as an opt-in. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11387.863s">If</a>  you're interested, you want to go green, you want to reduce your carbon footprint, and you want to belong to this municipal aggregation, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11395.627s">And</a>  I think the city should offer it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11398.084s">But</a>  don't include me in something, Mr. President, and say I have to opt out. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11402.206s">And</a>  then don't say, well, you know, we're going to decide how much green energy you purchase. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11408.268s">If</a>  you don't like that, you can opt out of that, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11411.67s">It's</a>  the big opt-out program. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11413.73s">You</a>  can opt out of that, too, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11416.412s">So</a>  I'm not fully sold on this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11419.653s">I</a>  appreciate Mr. Capucci coming up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11422.014s">And</a>  like I said, this will definitely get its fair share of a hearing within <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11427.582s">the</a>  Energy Committee, and it will be reported back out to this council to make a full decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11433.003s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Vice President.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11613.225s">Again,</a>  it wasn't me that was running. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11616.367s">I</a>  was just tracking it. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11617.868s">It</a>  was my wife. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11619.149s">She</a>  did a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11619.97s">Very</a>  proud of her. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11621.231s">She</a>  was exhausting but she did a heck of a job. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11624.393s">Proud</a>  of her.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11627.755s">Mr.</a>  President, I think it's also important to point out what a great job long-time Medford resident David McGillivray, Boston Marathon race director, has been doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11635.182s">My</a>  classmate. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11635.902s">Yes,</a>  and he's been involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11637.824s">He's</a>  been involved in this race now, I think it's for the last 40 or so years. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11642.288s">And</a>  one of the things that I heard on the radio today that was amazing to me, Mr. President, was that he's at the starting line at Hopkington when the gun goes off. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11649.434s">Then</a>  he's at the finish line on Boylston Street when the first wave comes through. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11652.95s">And</a>  then at eight o'clock at night, he's back in Hopkinton running the race himself. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11657.232s">Um,</a>  so it just shows what a commitment and what a love he has for the sport and how, uh, he's been able to turn this passion into a career. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11662.975s">And</a>  it really is inspiring. <a href="https://youtu.be/JQDXlkVE8zY&t=11664.675s">So</a>  I'd like to thank Dave for all his work as well.</p>
