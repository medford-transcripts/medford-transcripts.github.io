[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

90
00:03:31,872 --> 00:03:35,295
[SPEAKER_08]: So 11 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative, 4 absent.

91
00:03:35,395 --> 00:03:36,757
[SPEAKER_08]: The minutes are approved.

92
00:03:39,356 --> 00:03:43,818
[SPEAKER_08]: The next thing we have for the committee is an approval of project invoices.

93
00:03:43,938 --> 00:03:55,461
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going to turn this over to Matt from the left field team to just give us a quick explainer of what we can expect during this process.

94
00:03:56,581 --> 00:03:58,002
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we will call the roll.

95
00:04:04,184 --> 00:04:04,944
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

96
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:11,585
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, Jen, actually, did you want to, uh, go through the invoices?

97
00:04:13,225 --> 00:04:13,786
[SPEAKER_10]: I can do that.

98
00:04:13,826 --> 00:04:14,046
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

99
00:04:14,906 --> 00:04:20,627
[SPEAKER_05]: I keep getting a screen share request popping up on my screen from Chelsea Adams.

100
00:04:23,308 --> 00:04:25,909
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, don't do it.

101
00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:27,749
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, I know.

102
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:28,969
[SPEAKER_05]: I just, it won't go away.

103
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,210
[SPEAKER_03]: We cannot see it.

104
00:04:38,565 --> 00:04:41,470
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, so I'll take folks through.

105
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:42,191
[SPEAKER_10]: Have a fun ride.

106
00:04:52,453 --> 00:04:59,355
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, so you will start to see every month we will have invoices to approve.

107
00:04:59,395 --> 00:05:02,776
[SPEAKER_10]: Right now we're starting small because we have just the left field team on right now.

108
00:05:03,276 --> 00:05:08,098
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have just the left field invoice number one and number two.

109
00:05:08,598 --> 00:05:12,279
[SPEAKER_10]: This is for services during June and it looks like I do need to

110
00:05:12,859 --> 00:05:15,782
[SPEAKER_10]: update this description of services to say July as well.

111
00:05:16,662 --> 00:05:19,645
[SPEAKER_10]: Each invoice is in the amount of $25,000 and those are a combined of $50,000.

112
00:05:19,705 --> 00:05:23,508
[SPEAKER_10]: This is in line with the schedule of fee that we submitted with the contract.

113
00:05:34,137 --> 00:05:41,846
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, this list will start to grow as our team gets bigger, and we'll take you through these every month before we ask for approval.

114
00:05:43,267 --> 00:05:52,677
[SPEAKER_10]: Next month, we will also have this combined with a budget update that will kind of explain where we are in the expenditure of the

115
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:56,180
[SPEAKER_10]: Money against the budget.

116
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:56,440
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

117
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,601
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry if anyone can hear my dog sparking.

118
00:06:00,621 --> 00:06:01,001
[SPEAKER_08]: You're fine.

119
00:06:02,461 --> 00:06:04,002
[SPEAKER_08]: Perfect.

120
00:06:04,562 --> 00:06:09,963
[SPEAKER_08]: Does anybody have any questions for the left field team about the invoices before I call the motion?

121
00:06:14,564 --> 00:06:15,545
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, just one question.

122
00:06:17,705 --> 00:06:20,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, just wanted to ask someone to confirm that the budget is 525 and not 500.

123
00:06:20,866 --> 00:06:21,066
[SPEAKER_04]: I think

124
00:06:24,324 --> 00:06:27,145
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw 500 on an earlier page.

125
00:06:27,925 --> 00:06:28,166
[SPEAKER_08]: It is 525.

126
00:06:28,366 --> 00:06:29,906
[SPEAKER_08]: 525, okay, thank you.

127
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:34,688
[SPEAKER_08]: Are there other questions from the committee?

128
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:46,333
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I can move approval just pending the change on the second invoice to read probably July 1 to July 31st.

129
00:06:49,214 --> 00:06:52,455
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to approve as amended by Mayor Longo Kern, is there a second?

130
00:06:56,273 --> 00:06:56,633
[SPEAKER_06]: Second.

131
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,935
[SPEAKER_08]: Second by Brian Hilliard.

132
00:07:00,736 --> 00:07:02,037
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to call the roll.

00:07:02,757 --> 00:07:03,558

134
00:07:03,618 --> 00:07:04,358

00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:05,119

[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

140
00:07:10,282 --> 00:07:10,582
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

141
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:11,763
[SPEAKER_08]: Libby Brown?

142
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:12,604
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

143
00:07:13,244 --> 00:07:13,964

[SPEAKER_08]: Brian Hilliard?

147
00:07:17,927 --> 00:07:18,147
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

148
00:07:19,308 --> 00:07:20,789
[SPEAKER_08]: Tracy Keene is absent.

149
00:07:20,929 --> 00:07:21,950
[SPEAKER_08]: Emily Lazaro is absent.

150
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:22,570
[SPEAKER_08]: Nicole Morrell?

151
00:07:23,371 --> 00:07:23,651
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

152
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:25,272
[SPEAKER_08]: Erin Olopade?

153
00:07:26,128 --> 00:07:27,789
[SPEAKER_02]: He said yes to approve as amended.

154
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,031
[SPEAKER_08]: Luke Preissner?

155
00:07:31,752 --> 00:07:31,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

156
00:07:32,593 --> 00:07:33,433

158
00:07:35,575 --> 00:07:38,877

159
00:07:38,957 --> 00:07:41,239
[SPEAKER_08]: The motion passes, and the invoices are approved.

160
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:54,048
[SPEAKER_08]: So now that we have made that approval, the invoices will be submitted to the school's finance team, which we met with them last week to iron out this process.

161
00:07:55,021 --> 00:07:59,993
[SPEAKER_08]: and then they will be able to pay that out of the earmarked funds for the feasibility study.

162
00:08:00,695 --> 00:08:01,316
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you all.

163
00:08:04,218 --> 00:08:17,289
[SPEAKER_05]: And just to kind of bring that full circle, once we have the warrant number and check numbers for these invoices, we will be able to submit them to the MSBA for their reimbursement portion.

164
00:08:17,349 --> 00:08:22,373
[SPEAKER_05]: So after they're approved, it goes to the MSBA's pro-pay processes is what it's called.

165
00:08:23,113 --> 00:08:26,556
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll review them and then reimburse based on the eligible.

166
00:08:28,907 --> 00:08:30,828
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, whatever is eligible.

167
00:08:30,948 --> 00:08:33,990
[SPEAKER_05]: And at this point in the phase, everything is, is eligible.

168
00:08:35,031 --> 00:08:42,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so just wanted to note that on a, on how the reimbursement works with the MSBA after invoices are approved.

169
00:08:44,096 --> 00:08:44,276
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

170
00:08:44,336 --> 00:08:44,837
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Matt.

171
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:45,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

172
00:08:47,118 --> 00:08:52,821
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, moving on to item number four on the agenda, which is our designer selection process update.

173
00:08:52,861 --> 00:08:54,022
[SPEAKER_08]: So Matt, I will turn it over to you.

174
00:08:54,772 --> 00:08:54,992
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

175
00:08:56,174 --> 00:08:56,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

176
00:08:57,155 --> 00:09:01,120
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll go through the next four or five slides fairly quickly.

177
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,524
[SPEAKER_05]: We have talked about the designer process before.

178
00:09:04,684 --> 00:09:10,051
[SPEAKER_05]: I really want to try to focus our times on the actual evaluations of the designer proposals.

179
00:09:10,892 --> 00:09:13,113
[SPEAKER_05]: since we're expecting them at the end of the month.

180
00:09:13,654 --> 00:09:19,419
[SPEAKER_05]: But just to run through schedule quickly, we did issue the request for services on July 30th.

181
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:25,004
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have had quite a bit of interest in the project.

182
00:09:25,604 --> 00:09:34,532
[SPEAKER_05]: We have over 20 architectural firms that have pulled the RFS and we hope to see their submissions, which will be on August 27th.

183
00:09:36,113 --> 00:09:42,314
[SPEAKER_05]: Between now and then, we will hold a visit at Medford High School on the 13th with the interested designers.

184
00:09:43,174 --> 00:09:48,675
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll have an opportunity to ask questions about the project and anything that they may need clarification on.

185
00:09:48,775 --> 00:09:50,176
[SPEAKER_05]: Questions will be due on the 20th.

186
00:09:51,236 --> 00:09:55,517
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll issue an addenda to the RFS answering those questions.

187
00:09:56,417 --> 00:09:59,497
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll need to issue that before the 25th, 48 hours before the proposed due date.

188
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:12,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Once we receive the proposals, the building committee will review, and especially the three designer selection panel members, which you'll see on a later slide.

189
00:10:14,126 --> 00:10:20,450
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll go to the September 23rd designer selection panel meeting at the MSBA.

190
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:23,933
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the first of the designer selection panel meetings.

191
00:10:23,993 --> 00:10:26,834
[SPEAKER_05]: That's to review the applications of all of the designers.

192
00:10:27,795 --> 00:10:47,148
[SPEAKER_05]: At the end of that meeting, the designer selection panel will rank or invite the top four, typically, firms to a second DSP meeting, which will be on October 6th, and that is for interviews of those shortlisted, your top four picks.

193
00:10:48,509 --> 00:10:52,732
[SPEAKER_05]: After the interviews, the designer selection panel will have a discussion,

194
00:10:53,372 --> 00:11:00,078
[SPEAKER_05]: And then those four firms will be ranked from most desired down to number four.

195
00:11:01,319 --> 00:11:05,743
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we would enter into a fee negotiation with that top firm.

196
00:11:07,765 --> 00:11:15,111
[SPEAKER_05]: We're hoping that after the second DSP meeting, we can move fairly quickly on getting a contract executed, and hopefully by mid-November.

197
00:11:17,099 --> 00:11:23,682
[SPEAKER_05]: We have them on board and we're starting some of the real robust feasibility study items with the design team.

198
00:11:28,084 --> 00:11:33,927
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on to just, again, a high-level overview of the designer selection process.

199
00:11:34,948 --> 00:11:41,731
[SPEAKER_05]: The designer selection process is a part of the MSBA's standard process.

200
00:11:42,131 --> 00:11:43,252
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a requirement that they

201
00:11:45,352 --> 00:11:50,073
[SPEAKER_05]: that they have through their program in order to hire the designer selection.

202
00:11:50,153 --> 00:11:57,455
[SPEAKER_05]: So they do not focus on the DCAM designer selection board since the MSBA designer selection panel kind of replaces that.

203
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:05,257
[SPEAKER_05]: Any project greater than 5 million, school building project with the MSBA requires a designer selection panel.

204
00:12:05,317 --> 00:12:06,297
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously this project

205
00:12:06,997 --> 00:12:10,960
[SPEAKER_05]: is far over $5 million, so we fall into that category.

206
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:17,244
[SPEAKER_05]: The selection of the designer is a qualifications-based selection.

207
00:12:17,745 --> 00:12:20,006
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to make sure that that's highlighted.

208
00:12:20,567 --> 00:12:34,637
[SPEAKER_05]: It is all based on the proposals and the qualifications that the architectural firms meet, and then you get into the contract negotiation after those designer selection panels that I mentioned on the previous slide.

209
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:45,012
[SPEAKER_05]: The qualifications and selection criteria are pretty similar on all MSBA projects.

210
00:12:46,712 --> 00:12:53,955
[SPEAKER_05]: They largely focus on the past experience and performance of the firms, what their current workload may be.

211
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:59,857
[SPEAKER_05]: They have to submit their entire consulting team with their submissions.

212
00:12:59,917 --> 00:13:03,598
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not just the architects, it's the electrical engineers, the plumbing engineers.

213
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,341
[SPEAKER_05]: the structural engineers.

214
00:13:07,001 --> 00:13:14,444
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a pretty big and robust packet that gets submitted with 25 plus sub consultants.

215
00:13:14,484 --> 00:13:19,946
[SPEAKER_05]: So we take a look at all of their consultants as well, make sure that they are also qualified to be a part of the team.

216
00:13:21,146 --> 00:13:23,487
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll look at the financial stability of each of the firms.

217
00:13:26,177 --> 00:13:35,080
[SPEAKER_05]: And along with the qualifications, also the individual people, everybody is required to submit a resume for anybody that is proposed to be on their team.

218
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:40,862
[SPEAKER_05]: And we also take a close look at the geographic proximity to the project.

219
00:13:40,882 --> 00:13:41,822
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't want somebody

220
00:13:42,353 --> 00:13:47,635
[SPEAKER_05]: that's going to have a hard time during construction getting to the job site to oversee the construction activities.

221
00:13:48,396 --> 00:13:57,560
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's something that we also want to make sure that the design firm is able to support the district as best as possible.

222
00:14:00,161 --> 00:14:08,144
[SPEAKER_05]: So as we get further down into some of the actual evaluation materials, you'll see some of these kind of criteria again.

223
00:14:11,532 --> 00:14:17,177
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll move on just so that we can get down to some of the bulk of the presentation.

224
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:26,727
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a reminder, the designer selection panel is composed of 13 members appointed by the executive director at the MSBA.

225
00:14:27,427 --> 00:14:32,192
[SPEAKER_05]: So these are all professionals, either in the educational or architectural or engineering spaces.

226
00:14:32,632 --> 00:14:36,554
[SPEAKER_05]: that get appointed to the board of directors.

227
00:14:38,074 --> 00:14:44,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Along with those 13 people, three members from the district are represented, which are the three people listed here.

228
00:14:47,162 --> 00:14:49,505
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, it's extremely important.

229
00:14:49,525 --> 00:14:58,234
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've, we've kind of talked about this before that, you know, the three members are vocal during that time, obviously, it's a board of 16 people, and you only have three people there.

230
00:14:58,794 --> 00:15:05,822
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, making sure that you're really highlighting the things that you like about certain firms and, you know, expressing your interest.

231
00:15:06,653 --> 00:15:10,800
[SPEAKER_05]: is certainly an important thing to do as that decision is being made.

232
00:15:14,606 --> 00:15:20,174
[SPEAKER_05]: DSP meetings, I kind of already talked, touched on this previously, you know, the three members from the district.

233
00:15:22,192 --> 00:15:27,794
[SPEAKER_05]: The MSBA is not fond of you coming into a DSP meeting with your firms already ranked.

234
00:15:28,734 --> 00:15:37,397
[SPEAKER_05]: The designer selection panel is the body that selects the architect and the designer, not just the three members or the building committee.

235
00:15:38,918 --> 00:15:46,020
[SPEAKER_05]: So yes, we want to have an idea of which architects are coming to the top, but the MSBA does not like

236
00:15:46,820 --> 00:16:12,020
[SPEAKER_05]: Us to come in with like here are 1 2 3 4 Because that's what's set at the at the designer selection panel meetings The bottom half of the screen here that the typical example when they ask you to The three members to vote on their top three choices first choice gets three points the second choice gets two points third choice gets one if

237
00:16:13,461 --> 00:16:18,625
[SPEAKER_05]: If we have a close fourth, the MSBA will allow you to interview that fourth designer.

238
00:16:20,026 --> 00:16:28,771
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's something we'll keep in mind once we get the proposals and are heading into the DSP meetings, you know, which four firms seem to be jumping out at us.

239
00:16:30,733 --> 00:16:37,317
[SPEAKER_10]: And just a quick update, Matt, I think the actual the date for that second DSP meeting is October 7th, which is the Tuesday.

240
00:16:38,398 --> 00:16:40,819
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll update this before we post the presentation.

241
00:16:43,292 --> 00:16:43,440
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

242
00:16:49,295 --> 00:17:01,122
[SPEAKER_05]: An award of contract, again, I kind of touched base on this, but after the two designer selection panels, you will have a top-ranked firm, and you will go into negotiations with that firm.

243
00:17:02,003 --> 00:17:07,886
[SPEAKER_05]: If negotiations are successful, you draft a contract and move on and get right into feasibility.

244
00:17:08,787 --> 00:17:15,431
[SPEAKER_05]: If they're not, you can decide to move on to your second-ranked designer and begin the negotiations with them.

245
00:17:20,778 --> 00:17:28,900
[SPEAKER_05]: If we don't decide to, and just to point out, yeah, if we don't go with the highest ranked firm, we do have to provide a written justification to the MSBA to go to our second.

246
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:36,221
[SPEAKER_05]: So if that ends up happening, we'll certainly work with you on that.

247
00:17:37,101 --> 00:17:44,002
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's fairly rare in my experience to not get the top ranked firm, but it obviously can happen.

248
00:17:44,062 --> 00:17:46,903
[SPEAKER_05]: So we wanted to touch on that quick.

249
00:17:49,136 --> 00:17:59,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Before I move into some of the materials of the actual evaluation process, are there any questions on process or schedule?

250
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:10,688
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm going to actually not share the PowerPoint for this just because it's impossible to read.

251
00:18:11,988 --> 00:18:12,729
[SPEAKER_05]: So I will...

252
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:19,882
[SPEAKER_05]: pull up the actual documents so we can look at them a little bit easier.

253
00:18:19,902 --> 00:18:25,824
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

254
00:18:26,084 --> 00:18:27,185
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you see my screen?

255
00:18:31,968 --> 00:18:39,850
[SPEAKER_05]: So the two examples of the two documents that were on that slide, one of them is this one.

256
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:44,232
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a designer and sub-consultant application matrix.

257
00:18:45,392 --> 00:18:54,695
[SPEAKER_05]: So as we get the proposals, we'll put each of the, you know, you have your architectural firm, who's the lead designer, and then all of their sub-consultants.

258
00:18:55,555 --> 00:18:56,876
[SPEAKER_05]: So left field will fill this out.

259
00:18:57,076 --> 00:18:58,956
[SPEAKER_05]: It's something we need to submit to the MSBA.

260
00:18:58,976 --> 00:19:00,117
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an MSBA document.

261
00:19:01,417 --> 00:19:07,138
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll just put, you know, which firm is being carried by each of the applicants.

262
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:14,420
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we also track if they are MBE or WBE certified on the sheet as well.

263
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:18,501
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll make a mark of which companies fall into those two categories.

264
00:19:19,722 --> 00:19:21,102
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the bottom part.

265
00:19:21,382 --> 00:19:25,603
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, Matt, through the chair, we just can't see anything in the yellow, if that matters.

266
00:19:27,223 --> 00:19:28,844
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to make it a little larger, sorry.

267
00:19:40,292 --> 00:19:44,113
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I got my share screen thing in the way.

268
00:19:44,133 --> 00:19:48,815
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that a little better?

269
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:52,196
[SPEAKER_03]: Much.

270
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:52,816
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

271
00:19:53,477 --> 00:19:53,857
[SPEAKER_05]: You're welcome.

272
00:19:58,064 --> 00:20:01,166
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, down at the bottom here, this is just kind of a yes or no.

273
00:20:01,206 --> 00:20:04,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Did they submit everything that they were supposed to submit?

274
00:20:05,969 --> 00:20:21,779
[SPEAKER_05]: Technically, if a firm does not submit any of these documents, you know, they haven't signed their application or they didn't provide any of their MCPPO certifications, they technically could be eliminated from the process just from not following the request for services request.

275
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:36,747
[SPEAKER_05]: This is more of a double check at the bottom, making sure that, again, the proposals are complete and meet all of the evaluation criteria laid out in the RFS.

276
00:20:36,807 --> 00:20:38,888
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, a pretty simple document.

277
00:20:38,948 --> 00:20:40,408
[SPEAKER_05]: This is something left field will complete.

278
00:20:42,729 --> 00:20:48,312
[SPEAKER_05]: The other document that was on that, and this is less important to see, this is just a reference check.

279
00:20:51,139 --> 00:21:07,204
[SPEAKER_05]: spreadsheet so as we get all of the proposals left field will also call all of the references that they include in their proposal they're required to to provide a minimum of three we try to get at least three and we you know we ask each of the

280
00:21:09,698 --> 00:21:13,161
[SPEAKER_05]: each of the references that we call how the firms performed.

281
00:21:14,362 --> 00:21:15,583
[SPEAKER_05]: Did they communicate well?

282
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:19,006
[SPEAKER_05]: Was their budget control and estimating on target?

283
00:21:20,047 --> 00:21:22,669
[SPEAKER_05]: Their document control, where their document's good?

284
00:21:22,709 --> 00:21:25,552
[SPEAKER_05]: Did they issue documents timely?

285
00:21:26,673 --> 00:21:31,337
[SPEAKER_05]: Design schedule, quite simply, did they meet the design schedule?

286
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:33,678
[SPEAKER_05]: Did we have to push back any deadlines?

287
00:21:35,824 --> 00:21:40,220
[SPEAKER_05]: And then construction administration, this is when the architect is actually on site.

288
00:21:41,236 --> 00:21:50,541
[SPEAKER_05]: walking around the job site, making sure that the design or the actual building itself is meeting the design that they've put in their documents.

289
00:21:50,621 --> 00:22:05,988
[SPEAKER_05]: So we ask these questions of three references from each of the designers and just to make sure that we're doing our due diligence and there's no surprises from any of the firms that have submitted.

290
00:22:09,915 --> 00:22:11,156
[SPEAKER_05]: Any questions on those two?

291
00:22:11,436 --> 00:22:12,577
[SPEAKER_05]: These are pretty straightforward.

292
00:22:12,617 --> 00:22:17,900
[SPEAKER_05]: They're largely, you know, left field's kind of responsibility to get completed.

293
00:22:22,204 --> 00:22:23,885
[SPEAKER_07]: If not... Oh, sorry.

294
00:22:23,905 --> 00:22:33,572
[SPEAKER_07]: When will we have to do our... When will we receive the applicants' information and how long will we have to rank them?

295
00:22:34,823 --> 00:22:40,348
[SPEAKER_05]: So we will be receiving our applications on August 27th.

296
00:22:41,589 --> 00:22:51,578
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to get them over to the MSBA shortly after that, but we have the ability to review up until the first designer selection panel meeting on September 26th.

297
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:56,002
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have about a month to review everything.

298
00:22:56,883 --> 00:22:59,966
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, we'll send them all to the MSBA as well so they can do their review.

299
00:23:01,867 --> 00:23:10,031
[SPEAKER_05]: And during that time, you know, we'll be doing these first two documents, the subconsultant matrix and this reference check as well.

300
00:23:10,791 --> 00:23:14,813
[SPEAKER_05]: The... Hi, Matt.

301
00:23:14,833 --> 00:23:19,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Before you continue... Are you still answering that question?

302
00:23:19,336 --> 00:23:21,257
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a follow-on question.

303
00:23:24,168 --> 00:23:25,669
[SPEAKER_08]: Luke, I was just trying to call on you.

304
00:23:26,729 --> 00:23:27,890
[SPEAKER_08]: Matt, Luke has a question.

305
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:33,173
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you think you could pause for a couple of questions?

306
00:23:33,253 --> 00:23:33,473
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

307
00:23:34,213 --> 00:23:34,433
[SPEAKER_08]: Luke?

308
00:23:35,314 --> 00:23:35,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Matt.

309
00:23:35,634 --> 00:23:35,874
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

310
00:23:36,274 --> 00:23:39,296
[SPEAKER_04]: So appreciate the insight into the process.

311
00:23:39,576 --> 00:23:46,840
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's good to see all the categories as well as sort of

312
00:23:48,608 --> 00:23:50,070
[SPEAKER_04]: how the measurements performed.

313
00:23:51,671 --> 00:24:05,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Are these documents, when populated, like articles of public record that we have to do something with or that we have to process, or is it all internal to left field and the three candidates on the DSP?

314
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:12,950
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think there's anything that the committee needs to do per se.

315
00:24:14,671 --> 00:24:21,416
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, if there's anything that jumps out at committee members during the review process, certainly let us know.

316
00:24:22,717 --> 00:24:29,181
[SPEAKER_05]: But no, it certainly will become a part of the public record of the designer selection process.

317
00:24:29,422 --> 00:24:31,123
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything is public record.

318
00:24:31,623 --> 00:24:35,406
[SPEAKER_05]: So yes, at the end of the day, they will become public record.

319
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:42,451
[SPEAKER_05]: but it's not something that we need to like post and share to, um, you know, throughout the city.

320
00:24:43,892 --> 00:24:58,643
[SPEAKER_08]: And in fact, um, when we went through this with, um, the OPM selection, the advice we got from our, uh, city solicitor was that all of those things could be made available once the contract was executed.

321
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:03,427
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so there, while they are public records, they're not,

322
00:25:03,807 --> 00:25:09,732
[SPEAKER_08]: for consumption during the selection process in that broad way that they would otherwise be.

323
00:25:10,713 --> 00:25:25,244
[SPEAKER_08]: So we immediately got lots of requests for people who did not get selected and the guidance from the city solicitor was that they have to wait until the contract is executed and we'll provide those requested documents to them and that's exactly what we did.

324
00:25:25,264 --> 00:25:29,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, great.

325
00:25:29,107 --> 00:25:29,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Makes sense.

326
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:29,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

327
00:25:30,628 --> 00:25:32,670
[SPEAKER_08]: Does anyone else have questions before we continue?

328
00:25:36,239 --> 00:25:37,080
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a quick question.

329
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:47,974
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're saying we get the proposals over to the MSBA, but I assume this is something that's like a PDF that will be shared with us to look at electronically.

330
00:25:48,014 --> 00:25:50,196
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not necessarily delivered.

331
00:25:50,217 --> 00:25:52,880
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not going to be like a hard copy somewhere we all have to go look at.

332
00:25:53,832 --> 00:25:58,516
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we did request, I think, four hard copies to be delivered to City Hall.

333
00:25:58,636 --> 00:26:02,039
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, everything for the most part is electronic.

334
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:09,004
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll make sure we have all of the proposals after the deadline at 4 p.m.

335
00:26:09,865 --> 00:26:12,848
[SPEAKER_05]: and send out a link with all of the proposals to the full committee.

336
00:26:17,191 --> 00:26:18,012
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other questions?

337
00:26:18,032 --> 00:26:22,956
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

338
00:26:26,194 --> 00:26:26,482
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

339
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:37,385
[SPEAKER_05]: Now over to the document that is most critical for the committee to understand, especially the three DSP members.

340
00:26:37,425 --> 00:26:45,831
[SPEAKER_05]: But we always encourage the full building committee to review the applications and try to fill out an evaluation matrix similar to this.

341
00:26:45,931 --> 00:26:48,132
[SPEAKER_05]: This is just an example of something we've used.

342
00:26:48,833 --> 00:26:53,516
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of keeps you away from numbering and ranking.

343
00:26:53,756 --> 00:26:55,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, the MSBA does not like that.

344
00:26:57,879 --> 00:27:06,266
[SPEAKER_05]: but it gives you a sense of what firms maybe were a bit more advantageous than others in each of the categories.

345
00:27:07,086 --> 00:27:20,677
[SPEAKER_05]: It uses a very simple kind of stoplight evaluation ranking, just highly advantageous, advantageous is yellow, and then not advantageous is red, just randomly populated on the far left here.

346
00:27:20,717 --> 00:27:26,181
[SPEAKER_05]: This is just an example of kind of what it may look like as you go through each of the criteria.

347
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:37,416
[SPEAKER_05]: And then at the bottom, it just has a summary that kind of gives you how many highly advantageous, advantageous and not advantageous categories each firm had.

348
00:27:38,076 --> 00:27:42,779
[SPEAKER_05]: So it kind of gives you the ability to look at it from a fairly high level.

349
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:47,482
[SPEAKER_05]: And as you look through each of the proposals, things will certainly jump out at you from one

350
00:27:49,863 --> 00:28:00,030
[SPEAKER_05]: from one proposal to another, and that may change your feeling on how you evaluate each of these criteria.

351
00:28:02,251 --> 00:28:08,275
[SPEAKER_05]: Before I get too far into it, are there any questions on how this works?

352
00:28:08,315 --> 00:28:10,556
[SPEAKER_05]: Does anybody want to look at anything specific?

353
00:28:14,212 --> 00:28:33,502
[SPEAKER_10]: If I can just add, just to say that this is a kind of important document to track your own thoughts when you're going through these, because as Matt had mentioned, we've got 20 applicants that have pulled the RFS and will likely have a lot of interest in this project.

354
00:28:33,562 --> 00:28:34,603
[SPEAKER_10]: So when we're going through,

355
00:28:35,303 --> 00:28:39,746
[SPEAKER_10]: a high number of these proposals, you're going to tend to forget who said what.

356
00:28:39,786 --> 00:28:47,310
[SPEAKER_10]: And so when you're reviewing, make some notes, use this form to kind of help compare in your own mind.

357
00:28:48,711 --> 00:28:51,533
[SPEAKER_10]: Just helpful when we have so many that we're expecting.

358
00:28:51,553 --> 00:28:56,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and I can certainly create a notes section

359
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,741
[SPEAKER_05]: or a note sheet or something to include with this.

360
00:29:03,342 --> 00:29:09,965
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll make sure everybody has this in the native Excel file so they can edit it and do what they need.

361
00:29:10,425 --> 00:29:16,008
[SPEAKER_05]: But I can add a specific note section just to help organize things a little better.

362
00:29:22,506 --> 00:29:25,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Any specific questions?

363
00:29:25,688 --> 00:29:32,513
[SPEAKER_05]: I know there's probably a lot of people that haven't been through this before, and it definitely can be fairly daunting.

364
00:29:32,553 --> 00:29:37,777
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if many people had a chance to look at the example proposal that I sent over.

365
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:44,803
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple of weeks ago is actually this proposal here.

366
00:29:46,304 --> 00:29:51,629
[SPEAKER_05]: It was from KBA on the Brockton High School project who inevitably won that project.

367
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:59,517
[SPEAKER_05]: But it gives you a sense, you know, this is 85 pages long, so they are pretty long documents.

368
00:30:02,711 --> 00:30:08,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Does anybody have any desire to walk through this quickly just to kind of see how they're laid out?

369
00:30:09,499 --> 00:30:17,788
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I don't know kind of what the feeling is on, you know, people's comfort level on reviewing these proposals.

370
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:30,338
[SPEAKER_08]: Am I correct that the MSBA is pretty prescriptive about what must be included in the proposal, just like they are with the RFS for OPMs?

371
00:30:30,518 --> 00:30:31,319
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that correct?

372
00:30:31,379 --> 00:30:31,699
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

373
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:32,400
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

374
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:45,090
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think the structure in general, the structure of the proposals will look somewhat similar because they're required to complete the same set of documents, and I think you'll

375
00:30:46,081 --> 00:30:50,164
[SPEAKER_08]: sort of quickly find the pieces of the proposal that speak to you.

376
00:30:50,384 --> 00:30:55,188
[SPEAKER_08]: And it may or may not be what the, like, prescribed attachments are.

377
00:30:56,029 --> 00:31:00,432
[SPEAKER_08]: And they weren't for me, certainly, in the RFS review process for the OPM.

378
00:31:00,472 --> 00:31:08,158
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think it's, you know, good to just take them in for what they are when we receive them.

379
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:12,822
[SPEAKER_08]: So unless people have specific questions, I don't think we need to go through this.

380
00:31:13,602 --> 00:31:14,263
[SPEAKER_08]: Any questions?

381
00:31:16,979 --> 00:31:23,782
[SPEAKER_10]: I will say there's usually a few pages towards the end of the approach to your project where Matt's clicking right now.

382
00:31:23,802 --> 00:31:31,145
[SPEAKER_10]: There will be a few pages reserved for specifically how they're taking a look at your project.

383
00:31:32,465 --> 00:31:34,586
[SPEAKER_10]: I usually find those very interesting.

384
00:31:35,487 --> 00:31:43,950
[SPEAKER_10]: And not to mention things that you might not be thinking of that you can take forward with us as we move through the design process.

385
00:31:45,811 --> 00:31:48,513
[SPEAKER_10]: Some good information in this particular section.

386
00:31:49,613 --> 00:32:00,399
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, and like Jen said that that's definitely typically towards the end up in the, in the front is a lot of those requirements, you know, like MCPPO certifications.

387
00:32:02,693 --> 00:32:05,935
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, the project teams resumes are all in here.

388
00:32:05,975 --> 00:32:13,038
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's probably like half of this, because it's not just the design, not just the architectural firm, it's all of their consultants as well.

389
00:32:14,218 --> 00:32:16,880
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a lot of, you know, resumes.

390
00:32:19,041 --> 00:32:27,685
[SPEAKER_05]: But I would say the large majority of the information that's going to capture is going to be in, you know, each firm's approach to your project.

391
00:32:29,604 --> 00:32:35,788
[SPEAKER_05]: And obviously, as we get these, feel free to reach out to any of the left field members with questions you have.

392
00:32:36,729 --> 00:32:40,351
[SPEAKER_05]: We're more than happy to talk to you and walk you through it.

393
00:32:43,152 --> 00:32:45,654
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we have one question from Luke.

394
00:32:47,275 --> 00:32:47,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

395
00:32:52,185 --> 00:32:57,426
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got a timeline and August 27th is a consequential date.

396
00:32:57,466 --> 00:33:00,107
[SPEAKER_04]: That's sort of the end of the suspense.

397
00:33:00,207 --> 00:33:07,569
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have a number of these designer proposals, potentially 20, maybe less, but good number.

398
00:33:09,249 --> 00:33:18,451
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to clarify, will this committee in its, I guess, entirety be reviewing each proposal and scoring per that spreadsheet?

399
00:33:19,228 --> 00:33:24,945
[SPEAKER_04]: or is it a subset of this committee that's kind of performing the evaluation?

400
00:33:28,821 --> 00:33:32,682
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen it done differently in different cities.

401
00:33:32,702 --> 00:33:35,883
[SPEAKER_05]: I've had full committees review each of the proposals.

402
00:33:35,943 --> 00:33:38,964
[SPEAKER_05]: I've had people create a smaller selection committee.

403
00:33:40,725 --> 00:33:45,707
[SPEAKER_05]: My general feeling on it is the more eyes on it, the better.

404
00:33:45,807 --> 00:33:49,088
[SPEAKER_05]: More different walks of life, looking at it from slightly different optics.

405
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:53,049
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, is always a good way to kind of get more feedback.

406
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:57,751
[SPEAKER_05]: But it is certainly up to the committee's, you know, preference.

407
00:33:59,332 --> 00:34:05,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, those three DSP members, you know, certainly need to review them and understand them.

408
00:34:06,354 --> 00:34:12,457
[SPEAKER_05]: But we always do try to encourage the full committees to review them, again, just from what I mentioned before.

409
00:34:12,477 --> 00:34:15,718
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if Jen or Linda have anything to add.

410
00:34:16,683 --> 00:34:23,170
[SPEAKER_10]: I would add that, so this committee will review, will have access to everything.

411
00:34:23,251 --> 00:34:36,225
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think from what I've seen work best, we are, I would say those score sheets with the colors are really more for your personal review and as a group we'll discuss.

412
00:34:38,567 --> 00:34:53,523
[SPEAKER_10]: And Matt or Linda, correct me if you've seen it, but it's really to help inform those three DSP members on the goals and the hopes and dreams of this committee so they can bring that into the DSP meetings.

413
00:34:56,146 --> 00:35:19,137
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I think it's going to be more of a kind of discussion when we go over everything, and less about, you know, scoring things against each other, saying, you know, I voted for this person, you know, I'm saying this is highly advantageous, and somebody else says this is highly advantageous, just so that we can stay away from what the MSBA would consider scoring.

414
00:35:22,799 --> 00:35:24,060
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, right.

415
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:48,736
[SPEAKER_04]: So to our committee, is this a process that we've already determined and kind of identified sort of roles and responsibilities for, or is that a yet to be activity for us, just seeking to kind of remove any ambiguity in, I guess, our responsibilities in this process?

416
00:35:48,756 --> 00:35:48,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Because

417
00:35:49,844 --> 00:36:02,210
[SPEAKER_04]: August 27th will be here before we know it and with potentially 20 proposals to get through and a variety of, I'll say, evaluation criteria to process.

418
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:03,631
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a workload.

419
00:36:05,432 --> 00:36:16,557
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, I guess, do we know how we're going to process this volume or is that a yet to be sort of determined

420
00:36:19,144 --> 00:36:21,405
[SPEAKER_08]: So I can answer that.

421
00:36:21,685 --> 00:36:30,289
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, we have a building committee scheduled in the timeframe between August 27th and the designer selection panel.

422
00:36:30,309 --> 00:36:33,830
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not exactly remembering the date, but there is 1 scheduled in, um.

423
00:36:36,811 --> 00:36:48,015
[SPEAKER_08]: September, and it was scheduled that way so that the entire committee could provide their insight and perspective to the members of the DSP.

424
00:36:49,356 --> 00:36:53,137
[SPEAKER_08]: Unless this team feels differently, that that should not be the case.

425
00:36:53,197 --> 00:36:57,419
[SPEAKER_08]: That was what we were planning on for the next building committee meeting.

426
00:36:58,619 --> 00:36:59,420
[SPEAKER_08]: September 15th.

427
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:00,260
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

428
00:37:13,767 --> 00:37:19,472
[SPEAKER_08]: So, before we move on, is there anybody who feels like we should not proceed in that fashion?

429
00:37:27,622 --> 00:37:34,208
[SPEAKER_00]: I think maybe if I could just add something real quick to the committee in regards to these questions.

430
00:37:34,349 --> 00:37:43,738
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's, if you look at it, sort of more of a way of determining which ones are out versus which one is your favourite.

431
00:37:43,978 --> 00:37:48,462
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sort of trying to eliminate the ones that you don't think will be a good fit.

432
00:37:49,663 --> 00:38:02,355
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you start looking at it from that aspect, it might be a little less daunting because there will be some that are just submitting it, even though they're just going to not be qualified for a project of this size.

433
00:38:03,703 --> 00:38:11,045
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we have 20 firms that have requested it, most likely we will not get all 20 submissions.

434
00:38:11,925 --> 00:38:21,147
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say you get 15 to 17 of those, you could start looking at probably five or six of those might just not be qualified at all.

435
00:38:21,307 --> 00:38:30,029
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of the MSBA not wanting you to rank which ones are the favorites, it's a little bit easier to just sort of see which ones should we not consider.

436
00:38:31,983 --> 00:38:36,887
[SPEAKER_07]: So through the chair, those will be taken out so we don't even have to review them.

437
00:38:37,367 --> 00:38:38,888
[SPEAKER_07]: Left Field is going to do that for us.

438
00:38:38,928 --> 00:38:41,090
[SPEAKER_07]: So if 20 submit fives.

439
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:42,391
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we have to do that.

440
00:38:42,411 --> 00:38:44,812
[SPEAKER_07]: We have to do that.

441
00:38:45,393 --> 00:38:47,314
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

442
00:38:47,454 --> 00:38:54,339
[SPEAKER_08]: The MSBA does not want the left field team telling us what we should pick.

443
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:59,183
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're here to help guide our process, but it is our process.

444
00:39:00,937 --> 00:39:04,579
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I don't know if anybody could weed out the ones that just don't qualify at all.

445
00:39:07,021 --> 00:39:26,174
[SPEAKER_10]: There will be some, like Matt was saying, we will review the things that were, you know, the box needs to be checked so that it kind of frees up not just the DSP members, but the larger committee to really focus in on, I think those approach to your project sheets that Matt was showing.

446
00:39:26,194 --> 00:39:27,315
[SPEAKER_10]: I think there's six,

447
00:39:28,135 --> 00:39:31,659
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to say six pages for each portfolio worth of that.

448
00:39:31,699 --> 00:39:32,740
[SPEAKER_10]: So that kind of really narrows.

449
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:37,624
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't feel as daunting if you're really focused on those sections as this larger committee.

450
00:39:37,644 --> 00:39:50,857
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that will help everyone kind of focus in on what firms are doing well, what they're paying attention to, if they feel like they really have been paying attention to Medford and that they know Medford.

451
00:39:52,759 --> 00:39:56,604
[SPEAKER_10]: As opposed to all the nitty gritty details that we will fill out in those spreadsheets.

452
00:39:57,405 --> 00:40:02,672
[SPEAKER_10]: So those are the things I think that are probably worth the most focus for this larger group, especially.

453
00:40:02,692 --> 00:40:06,297
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and I think we also have a very.

454
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:14,821
[SPEAKER_08]: well represented committee with lots of different strengths and interests.

455
00:40:15,582 --> 00:40:21,483
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I don't think everyone needs to evaluate every proposal on all the same things.

456
00:40:22,683 --> 00:40:25,564
[SPEAKER_08]: But like, I'll pick on Tracy for just a second.

457
00:40:25,624 --> 00:40:34,046
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I'm expecting Tracy to tell us what he thinks about all things performing arts, because that is his

458
00:40:34,826 --> 00:40:37,567
[SPEAKER_08]: background and his passion and the things that he's good at.

459
00:40:39,027 --> 00:40:42,528
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, one of the reasons his application was so appealing to us.

460
00:40:42,608 --> 00:40:48,130
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think, you know, everyone's going to bring a different set of criteria to the table.

461
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:51,651
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think when we talk about what impressed us about people or

462
00:40:52,447 --> 00:40:56,169
[SPEAKER_08]: what didn't seem like it was sufficient in our next meeting.

463
00:40:56,189 --> 00:41:07,657
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we'll hear lots of different perspectives from lots of different people that will help us be as prepared as possible to be 3 of 13 people.

464
00:41:07,737 --> 00:41:15,222
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have a big job to do to represent Medford amongst a bunch of people who

465
00:41:16,222 --> 00:41:24,364
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, certainly have done this more than we have, but are not don't live here and, you know, aren't the ones that will receive this building.

466
00:41:24,424 --> 00:41:29,085
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think all the, all that feedback, the better in our next meeting.

467
00:41:31,086 --> 00:41:38,788
[SPEAKER_04]: Jenny, can I ask if we're discouraged from assessing the entirety of the proposal and are instead is viewed as specialists kind of.

468
00:41:39,563 --> 00:41:53,195
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, with you can review in any way that you want Luke, I'm just saying that, like, we don't need we don't need everybody, like, going through all the, like, my new shut and the nitty gritty, like, left field is going to handle the qualifying things.

469
00:41:53,895 --> 00:41:59,320
[SPEAKER_08]: And if there are things that you're particularly passionate about, that's what we want to hear from this group.

470
00:41:59,961 --> 00:42:00,241
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't.

471
00:42:01,607 --> 00:42:06,550
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you have the time and inclination to go through every part of the proposal, that's amazing.

472
00:42:07,651 --> 00:42:12,333
[SPEAKER_08]: But just everyone has a different amount of ability to do that.

473
00:42:12,433 --> 00:42:27,102
[SPEAKER_08]: So we can, but I think that I just don't want people to be discouraged from putting their, like, piece, you know, their piece of their interest into the conversation if they don't have time to review everything, which is just kind of.

474
00:42:28,007 --> 00:42:30,208
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it's going to be September and back to school.

475
00:42:30,248 --> 00:42:31,988
[SPEAKER_08]: So we should prepare for that too.

476
00:42:33,669 --> 00:42:34,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

477
00:42:34,209 --> 00:42:55,274
[SPEAKER_04]: And just to further clarify, the homework assignment is not written feedback, but instead just a commitment to read proposals, assess them however we feel is important, and then arrive at the meeting on the 15th and verbally fight or defend any particular thing that we're interested in.

478
00:42:55,614 --> 00:42:57,675
[SPEAKER_04]: So written feedback is not sought,

479
00:42:58,462 --> 00:43:01,903
[SPEAKER_04]: full assessment of proposals is not required.

480
00:43:02,903 --> 00:43:07,865
[SPEAKER_04]: And instead, it's, you know, almost sounds like a best effort on the 15th.

481
00:43:08,385 --> 00:43:09,385
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, exactly.

482
00:43:09,685 --> 00:43:10,045
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

483
00:43:10,165 --> 00:43:10,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

484
00:43:10,365 --> 00:43:11,486
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want that clarified.

485
00:43:11,506 --> 00:43:11,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

486
00:43:11,806 --> 00:43:17,347
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

487
00:43:17,447 --> 00:43:24,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me open the presentation back up.

488
00:43:28,592 --> 00:43:42,439
[SPEAKER_05]: So if there's no other questions on the designer selection process side of things or the DSP or proposal review, we have two other updates that we did want to talk about.

489
00:43:43,179 --> 00:43:48,882
[SPEAKER_05]: One was quickly the, hold on, something's going on.

490
00:43:49,622 --> 00:43:49,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

491
00:43:56,465 --> 00:44:07,451
[SPEAKER_05]: One of them was the educational plan, and the goal was to kind of get ahead of the educational plan before the architect gets on board.

492
00:44:07,491 --> 00:44:15,135
[SPEAKER_05]: We know that that's something that they're going to be working on first, so we wanted to get a little bit of a head start and start to work on it.

493
00:44:19,317 --> 00:44:32,801
[SPEAKER_05]: over the last couple of months are on the screen here, but I did want to invite Dr. Galussi to kind of fill us in quickly or mention anything that she's seen about the ed plan.

494
00:44:34,002 --> 00:44:35,002
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, yep, no problem.

495
00:44:35,042 --> 00:44:35,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

496
00:44:36,905 --> 00:44:41,608
[SPEAKER_03]: So the ed plan is a really critical component of this work.

497
00:44:41,828 --> 00:44:48,973
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we've been trying to make sure that we're keeping our administrators updated and in the work.

498
00:44:49,053 --> 00:44:54,516
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that started with, at the end of each year, we have what's called an administrative retreat.

499
00:44:54,636 --> 00:44:56,758
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just meetings to close out the year.

500
00:44:58,519 --> 00:45:02,505
[SPEAKER_03]: Adele and Jen joined that meeting to kind of frame the work.

501
00:45:03,446 --> 00:45:11,597
[SPEAKER_03]: I also spoke about, you know, the importance and how this is the document that's really going to aid us in a lot of decision making as we move through this process.

502
00:45:12,778 --> 00:45:28,585
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they also were there to answer questions and just kind of the administrative unit was able to get introduced to Jen and Adele, who is our educational consultant through left field, former superintendent.

503
00:45:28,765 --> 00:45:32,027
[SPEAKER_03]: So I definitely, the educators will be leaning on her a lot.

504
00:45:33,087 --> 00:45:38,988
[SPEAKER_03]: So we kind of, after that meeting, I sent a memo to really outline the process.

505
00:45:39,129 --> 00:45:59,634
[SPEAKER_03]: Jen set us up really nicely with a lot of the information that we needed, so it was pretty much taking a lot of that information and just framing it in a memo for administration to kind of get them thinking before people went off and enjoyed some time at the pool and the beach, so they could be mindful and kind of have that thinking.

506
00:45:59,654 --> 00:46:00,854
[SPEAKER_03]: A month later,

507
00:46:01,857 --> 00:46:11,090
[SPEAKER_03]: It was followed up by a little bit more specific of a memo regarding now like a timeline and hard dates, really this educational plan to what.

508
00:46:14,292 --> 00:46:35,962
[SPEAKER_03]: member graham spoke about this also is pretty prescribed there are it's broken down by like departments so it's pretty clear when we look at our administrators the pieces that principals are going to kind of be responsible for versus the pieces that some of our curriculum directors and leads would be responsible for so

509
00:46:37,463 --> 00:46:46,353
[SPEAKER_03]: That memo at the end of July was very clear in assigning what the tasks were for administrators to be completing.

510
00:46:47,254 --> 00:46:52,159
[SPEAKER_03]: We're asking for their drafts, for them to first start and frame what their draft would be.

511
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,562
[SPEAKER_03]: Really, it's composed of two questions.

512
00:46:54,622 --> 00:46:56,624
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty much like, what are we doing now?

513
00:46:57,645 --> 00:47:00,628
[SPEAKER_03]: to deliver curriculum and how are we teaching?

514
00:47:01,368 --> 00:47:03,410
[SPEAKER_03]: And what would we envision?

515
00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:07,133
[SPEAKER_03]: How do we want this to look in a new building?

516
00:47:07,973 --> 00:47:12,977
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we asked administrators next week to have that draft finished.

517
00:47:13,818 --> 00:47:17,141
[SPEAKER_03]: so that we're set when we welcome teachers back.

518
00:47:18,102 --> 00:47:27,492
[SPEAKER_03]: And the administrators can be working with the teachers on the draft and getting their voice into this document.

519
00:47:28,252 --> 00:47:32,436
[SPEAKER_03]: So to help the teachers provide a little bit of framing,

520
00:47:33,437 --> 00:47:37,399
[SPEAKER_03]: tours were set up that we've been engaged, the last one finished today.

521
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:51,848
[SPEAKER_03]: You know we've had some tours previously, but the Medford High School staff was invited to tour Dover High School in New Hampshire on the 6th, Waltham High School on the 7th, and today was Attleboro High School.

522
00:47:52,868 --> 00:47:59,294
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there's been a nice cross section of administration that's gone to some of these tours as well as educators.

523
00:48:00,915 --> 00:48:11,624
[SPEAKER_03]: And also some of those educators are on union boards within the teachers union, which I think is also important.

524
00:48:12,104 --> 00:48:14,647
[SPEAKER_03]: And so now they've had the framing with the tours.

525
00:48:14,987 --> 00:48:18,490
[SPEAKER_03]: And when they return, they're going to be able to do some work with

526
00:48:18,810 --> 00:48:26,114
[SPEAKER_03]: principals and department leads really working on the draft to get it ready for the end of September submission.

527
00:48:27,494 --> 00:48:33,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy to answer any questions if people have questions about this level of work that we've been doing for the educational plan.

528
00:48:33,497 --> 00:48:36,999
[SPEAKER_08]: Are there any questions from the committee?

529
00:48:37,019 --> 00:48:47,384
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

530
00:48:49,281 --> 00:48:49,581
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

531
00:48:51,122 --> 00:48:52,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for that update.

532
00:48:53,042 --> 00:48:58,905
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really good that we're, you know, I would say this far ahead of the educational plan.

533
00:48:58,925 --> 00:49:03,106
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, again, typically this doesn't really start until the designers on board.

534
00:49:03,186 --> 00:49:10,409
[SPEAKER_05]: So really appreciate the district for jumping on this and I think it will really help us in the back end of the schedule.

535
00:49:13,335 --> 00:49:27,142
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the last item that we had talked about in June was this site selection kind of option evaluating and looking at the different options that are throughout the city for potential sites.

536
00:49:28,083 --> 00:49:34,726
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, this is not very legible on a slide, so I am going to pull up the actual document.

537
00:49:44,633 --> 00:49:44,893
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

538
00:49:45,954 --> 00:49:46,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Can everybody see that now?

539
00:49:46,995 --> 00:49:48,056
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully a little better.

540
00:49:51,619 --> 00:49:52,560
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, much better.

541
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:53,541
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

542
00:49:55,943 --> 00:50:09,614
[SPEAKER_05]: So just to explain how this is laid out, going down the left-hand side are just kind of different, you know, site criteria and then a little bit of description and kind of how construction would take place on each of those sites.

543
00:50:11,067 --> 00:50:13,389
[SPEAKER_05]: the MSB enrollment, which is the same throughout.

544
00:50:16,372 --> 00:50:19,414
[SPEAKER_05]: Where the site is, what kind of site is it?

545
00:50:20,995 --> 00:50:21,896
[SPEAKER_05]: Who owns the site?

546
00:50:21,956 --> 00:50:22,677
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it city owned?

547
00:50:22,737 --> 00:50:23,738
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it not city owned?

548
00:50:24,338 --> 00:50:26,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it parkland requiring an Article 97 land swap?

549
00:50:29,442 --> 00:50:34,025
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's kind of what the owner category is, cost to obtain.

550
00:50:35,066 --> 00:50:42,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of these are either NA or do require an Article 97 land swap or are on the existing site.

551
00:50:44,212 --> 00:50:46,814
[SPEAKER_05]: The only one I think is the Medford Square.

552
00:50:46,834 --> 00:50:53,338
[SPEAKER_05]: I did not have a dollar value, but I do believe that that development has moved forward.

553
00:50:59,785 --> 00:51:16,574
[SPEAKER_05]: Just some additional notes about each site, the description of each one, what the acreage is, potential traffic issues or concerns, how will the bus routes

554
00:51:18,775 --> 00:51:20,197
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, fare on those sites.

555
00:51:20,757 --> 00:51:21,698
[SPEAKER_05]: Same with pedestrian.

556
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:27,105
[SPEAKER_05]: Community and proximity, you know, how is the site located within town?

557
00:51:27,825 --> 00:51:33,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Site attributes, you know, is there anything specific about the site that, you know, we need to be aware of?

558
00:51:35,074 --> 00:51:48,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and then just a quick overview of kind of construction phasing again, kind of how we foresee a project on each of these sites going, uh, and then pros and cons between the between, uh, or between each of the sites.

559
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:50,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you know, a lot of the.

560
00:51:51,835 --> 00:51:59,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Options on the existing site have the advantage of being an existing educational facility.

561
00:51:59,483 --> 00:52:01,105
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a known location.

562
00:52:01,125 --> 00:52:04,428
[SPEAKER_05]: And then some of these others, as you'll see,

563
00:52:06,897 --> 00:52:21,684
[SPEAKER_05]: not only have Article 97 land swap, but may not be big enough to support the project, or will only be large enough to support the school and parking, but not play fields.

564
00:52:24,109 --> 00:52:29,772
[SPEAKER_05]: So just wanted to give that real quick before we went over the options across the top.

565
00:52:31,233 --> 00:52:36,255
[SPEAKER_05]: The first three here are all on the existing site.

566
00:52:36,295 --> 00:52:39,117
[SPEAKER_05]: These are kind of just different building options on that site.

567
00:52:40,297 --> 00:52:46,801
[SPEAKER_05]: We know that we're going to review these when the architect is on board, so I just wanted to include these on this as well.

568
00:52:48,142 --> 00:52:52,066
[SPEAKER_05]: So no real surprises per se on these first three.

569
00:52:52,146 --> 00:52:53,607
[SPEAKER_05]: It's at the existing site.

570
00:52:55,089 --> 00:52:56,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Base repair option is just that.

571
00:52:56,991 --> 00:52:57,892
[SPEAKER_05]: It's code upgrades.

572
00:52:57,912 --> 00:52:59,693
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not getting anything new and fancy.

573
00:53:00,755 --> 00:53:02,236
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a very base level.

574
00:53:04,578 --> 00:53:05,598
[SPEAKER_05]: base level project.

575
00:53:06,659 --> 00:53:12,841
[SPEAKER_05]: The base repair option also, I'll just note, is not considered reimbursable by the MSBA.

576
00:53:14,341 --> 00:53:21,143
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is something that if that option were to be the selected option, would not receive MSBA funding.

577
00:53:22,323 --> 00:53:24,204
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not something that I have ever done.

578
00:53:24,264 --> 00:53:28,085
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very rare that a base repair option is entertained.

579
00:53:28,906 --> 00:53:35,632
[SPEAKER_05]: But I did want to note that the renovation is just a renovation of the existing school as it currently is.

580
00:53:39,195 --> 00:53:46,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep general layout the same way, general, you know, kind of classroom and CTE class locations.

581
00:53:47,303 --> 00:53:50,646
[SPEAKER_05]: Really kind of just an upgrade to the current building as it is.

582
00:53:52,017 --> 00:53:54,239
[SPEAKER_05]: The addition renovation option, same site.

583
00:53:55,480 --> 00:54:09,372
[SPEAKER_05]: This would just be phased, you know, potential new building on the existing fields or existing parking lots with a renovation of, you know, portions of the school could be the pool house and the gym.

584
00:54:10,733 --> 00:54:13,275
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is just another option on this site.

585
00:54:16,243 --> 00:54:19,185
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we get into some of the new build options.

586
00:54:21,307 --> 00:54:32,194
[SPEAKER_05]: And I did go through the, I forget if it was a finance committee meeting, but where the committee talked in depth about the different sites that were potential.

587
00:54:32,995 --> 00:54:38,458
[SPEAKER_05]: So I pulled all of those sites into here and also took a look at just some other potential areas.

588
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:48,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Unsurprisingly, there's not a lot of free open land in Medford of this size to build a 350, 400,000 square foot school.

589
00:54:55,404 --> 00:54:58,607
[SPEAKER_05]: But just for completeness, I did list them all.

590
00:54:59,528 --> 00:55:09,298
[SPEAKER_05]: And please, if anybody has any comments, especially living in Medford, that you have on any particular site or know of another one that may not be on here, please let me know.

591
00:55:10,099 --> 00:55:12,261
[SPEAKER_05]: We do want to make sure that we've looked at all options.

592
00:55:15,097 --> 00:55:18,319
[SPEAKER_05]: This first new build is over at the Andrews Middle School.

593
00:55:19,179 --> 00:55:34,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, I think this was from that call, just a discussion of would it be possible to renovate the existing school and add on to it to create a larger high school that would require the middle school to be relocated, which

594
00:55:35,208 --> 00:55:37,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, then we're talking about a second school project.

595
00:55:38,670 --> 00:55:50,836
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of this was discussed in that meeting, and I think people were kind of already leaning away from this idea, but I did want to include it since it was talked about throughout Medford.

596
00:55:52,757 --> 00:55:58,980
[SPEAKER_05]: Does anybody have any questions on the Andrews Middle School site or anything to add?

597
00:56:01,669 --> 00:56:10,154
[SPEAKER_08]: Matt, you're correct that the finance committee at the time talked about several sites that did not make it into our final package.

598
00:56:10,174 --> 00:56:23,964
[SPEAKER_08]: And this was 1 of them where it was discussed and rolled out because of the, like, multiple business, the multiple building project need the, you know, the traffic patterns that would be exacerbated in that area, et cetera.

599
00:56:24,004 --> 00:56:25,585
[SPEAKER_08]: So that 1 was not in contention.

600
00:56:26,205 --> 00:56:32,766
[SPEAKER_08]: And your analysis is supporting that that would not be super viable for us to consider going forward.

601
00:56:32,826 --> 00:56:33,447
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that correct?

602
00:56:34,347 --> 00:56:34,727
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.

603
00:56:34,807 --> 00:56:35,147
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

604
00:56:35,287 --> 00:56:43,589
[SPEAKER_05]: I think those items that you mentioned, even from a site size, you know, that entire parcel is 43 plus acres, but that includes both of the schools.

605
00:56:44,489 --> 00:56:54,971
[SPEAKER_05]: So the middle, the Andrews middle school side of it, again, it depends where you would kind of break that parcel up is, you know, a bit smaller on that kind of North side where Andrews is.

606
00:56:56,071 --> 00:57:01,492
[SPEAKER_05]: away from the stadium, and I felt it was, you know, 12 to 15 or so acres.

607
00:57:01,572 --> 00:57:11,015
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yes, we could probably fit the school in parking, but I do think that the athletic fields would need to be located at a different location.

608
00:57:12,435 --> 00:57:12,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

609
00:57:15,436 --> 00:57:20,017
[SPEAKER_08]: The next new option is actually... Matt, before you go on, I think Luke has another question.

610
00:57:20,495 --> 00:57:21,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, go ahead, Luke.

611
00:57:22,356 --> 00:57:25,056
[SPEAKER_04]: And you've got to excuse me.

612
00:57:25,136 --> 00:57:26,937
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm an engineer, so I zero in on numbers.

613
00:57:27,797 --> 00:57:32,359
[SPEAKER_04]: You said 350,000 to 400,000 square foot.

614
00:57:32,779 --> 00:57:33,339
[SPEAKER_04]: Hypothetical.

615
00:57:33,539 --> 00:57:37,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally hypothetical, because there's really nothing on paper.

616
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:42,662
[SPEAKER_04]: But if that's the case, which, by the way, makes sense, because Attleboro is about that size.

617
00:57:42,742 --> 00:57:43,602
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about 407.

618
00:57:43,942 --> 00:57:47,703
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think there are enrollments about what we're expecting.

619
00:57:47,723 --> 00:57:49,884
[SPEAKER_04]: So Attleboro is a good reference point.

620
00:57:51,547 --> 00:57:55,817
[SPEAKER_04]: Then just calling into question one of the entries here, is it really 330,000 square feet?

621
00:58:00,664 --> 00:58:09,147
[SPEAKER_04]: And frankly, it may not matter, because I think this matrix serves a different purpose.

622
00:58:09,187 --> 00:58:10,268
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a comparative tool.

623
00:58:11,248 --> 00:58:16,590
[SPEAKER_04]: And that sort of square footage isn't actually really a comparison criterion.

624
00:58:16,610 --> 00:58:18,111
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just kind of like a note that's put in.

625
00:58:18,651 --> 00:58:21,932
[SPEAKER_04]: But I did want to just point that out, because I pointed it out in the past.

626
00:58:22,647 --> 00:58:38,152
[SPEAKER_04]: My belief is, in fact, the school's much larger, and all of the historical sort of news articles that I've looked at over in the library indicate it's like a half million square foot, yeah, half million square foot structure.

627
00:58:38,212 --> 00:58:45,555
[SPEAKER_04]: So just pointing it out and confirming, it doesn't really matter whether it's, you know, totally accurate here or not.

628
00:58:46,348 --> 00:58:53,893
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, certainly any square footages of anticipated new structure are very much hypothetical at this point.

629
00:58:53,953 --> 00:59:09,484
[SPEAKER_05]: We do need to get the architect on board to pull together a space summary and really understand what the full educational component of the building will be and how that will fit into the MSBA's guidelines.

630
00:59:10,645 --> 00:59:14,408
[SPEAKER_05]: So yes, definitely take any square footages on here as kind of a

631
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:20,729
[SPEAKER_05]: holding point for now, you know, that those will certainly become much more real as we get design going.

632
00:59:20,749 --> 00:59:31,531
[SPEAKER_08]: The other thing that's important to know about our square footage currently is that 1395 is high school students only.

633
00:59:31,551 --> 00:59:40,633
[SPEAKER_08]: It is not Kids Corner, it's not the MFN, it's not the administrative offices, and it is not the preschool expansion that was written into our

634
00:59:43,542 --> 00:59:44,082
[SPEAKER_08]: bid here.

635
00:59:44,162 --> 00:59:56,685
[SPEAKER_08]: So all of those, so 1395 in terms of number of students and the associated square footage, that's one portion of the square footage that comprises what currently happens in our building.

636
00:59:56,765 --> 01:00:03,967
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think we still, there's still a lot of work to do for us to sort of grapple with like how, what, how many square feet are we building here?

637
01:00:04,027 --> 01:00:13,109
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause there's a lot of other parts that are not in that 1395 plus the administrative offices, Luke, plus the Medford family network.

638
01:00:13,891 --> 01:00:19,337
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and those are all things that will have to go somewhere eventually.

639
01:00:20,278 --> 01:00:24,203
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um, okay, Matt, do you want to keep going?

640
01:00:27,704 --> 01:00:30,727
[SPEAKER_05]: The next new build option was on the existing site.

641
01:00:32,889 --> 01:00:38,234
[SPEAKER_05]: This was just different than the other three options on the existing high school site.

642
01:00:38,274 --> 01:00:39,955
[SPEAKER_05]: This would be an entirely new structure.

643
01:00:40,456 --> 01:00:42,478
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be some sort of phase construction.

644
01:00:42,518 --> 01:00:51,045
[SPEAKER_05]: You build one part of the school, move students and faculty in, demo the old part of the school and build new.

645
01:00:53,027 --> 01:00:55,708
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the only difference from the other options.

646
01:00:56,569 --> 01:01:07,273
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, just kind of to note, just in general, the diagrams that you see in these pictures are not necessarily how the phasing would work.

647
01:01:07,333 --> 01:01:15,056
[SPEAKER_05]: It is just a kind of high-level idea of how each of these projects could potentially work on the existing site.

648
01:01:18,028 --> 01:01:31,741
[SPEAKER_05]: The next new build option, the new existing site modified, we call this the modified one because this is, you know, what we will use to track, you know, potential use of DCR land.

649
01:01:33,222 --> 01:01:37,426
[SPEAKER_05]: So, and there's other Article 97 opportunities around the site.

650
01:01:37,906 --> 01:01:46,549
[SPEAKER_05]: So if that does end up becoming a part of the project, obviously the site itself will change slightly with that acquired land.

651
01:01:47,890 --> 01:01:52,491
[SPEAKER_05]: So we wanted to include that as a potential option on that site as well.

652
01:01:55,992 --> 01:02:02,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Medford Square, before I get into a lot of this, or this option, is this worth

653
01:02:04,181 --> 01:02:15,229
[SPEAKER_05]: talking about, I believe in April or May timeframe, there was a development company selected to develop this space or is this not the same area?

654
01:02:16,090 --> 01:02:16,670
[SPEAKER_08]: That is true.

655
01:02:16,691 --> 01:02:19,032
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

656
01:02:22,075 --> 01:02:27,679
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think this one kind of just comes off the table if it's being developed by another company.

657
01:02:32,385 --> 01:02:34,307
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll move on to the next one.

658
01:02:35,388 --> 01:02:44,278
[SPEAKER_05]: Columbus Park, again, another Article 97 land swap would be required for this location.

659
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:51,566
[SPEAKER_05]: Before I get too deep into it, the acreage on this park is about five acres.

660
01:02:53,267 --> 01:02:59,211
[SPEAKER_05]: We know that that is not going to be large enough even for just the school and parking and whatnot.

661
01:03:00,512 --> 01:03:05,116
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be extremely difficult to fit a building of the size we need on this site.

662
01:03:06,116 --> 01:03:10,319
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, there certainly would not be any play fields at this location.

663
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:21,087
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think this one is working its way off the list fairly quickly just from a size standpoint, nevermind any of the other criteria that we have here.

664
01:03:24,485 --> 01:03:31,273
[SPEAKER_05]: Placed at park also came up in that call, slightly bigger about 12 plus acres.

665
01:03:32,074 --> 01:03:36,559
[SPEAKER_05]: So, similar to kind of that middle school option that was around 12 or 15 acres.

666
01:03:37,761 --> 01:03:39,383
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, you may be able to fit the school.

667
01:03:40,964 --> 01:03:47,048
[SPEAKER_05]: in parking, but I think it's going to be extremely difficult to replace the existing high school fields on a 12-acre site.

668
01:03:48,769 --> 01:03:58,135
[SPEAKER_05]: So this would potentially be an option where a new school would be here, but play fields would be located at another spot.

669
01:04:01,337 --> 01:04:04,359
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the last option, Tufts Park.

670
01:04:04,939 --> 01:04:06,981
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe this also came up in the call.

671
01:04:08,442 --> 01:04:15,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, similar to the others, it's right around that 10 to 12 acreage range.

672
01:04:15,306 --> 01:04:19,128
[SPEAKER_05]: Real tough site to fit a school of this size with all of the amenities on it.

673
01:04:20,569 --> 01:04:29,655
[SPEAKER_05]: So similar type situation, could potentially fit a school, but definitely not fields at this location.

674
01:04:33,134 --> 01:04:46,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Does anybody want to look at any of these, any of the other criteria, you know, open discussion on any of the options or maybe another option that maybe I don't have on here that you think we should add?

675
01:04:46,541 --> 01:04:59,328
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not seeing any questions.

676
01:05:01,892 --> 01:05:17,944
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, if you all take a look at your agenda, we brought this back around, um, in this meeting, because our June meeting, we talked about potentially removing Medford square and Columbus park as options.

677
01:05:18,784 --> 01:05:24,531
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, to sort of reduce the scope of what the feasibility study will be looking for.

678
01:05:24,551 --> 01:05:32,280
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you remember back to the June meeting, we talked about wanting to do this exercise.

679
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:34,523
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Matt for doing such a thorough job.

680
01:05:35,263 --> 01:05:42,168
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, to make sure that, um, you know, inevitably when people have questions that there is a place we can point them to.

681
01:05:42,269 --> 01:05:45,311
[SPEAKER_08]: So we can certainly make this available on our website, et cetera.

682
01:05:45,571 --> 01:05:51,295
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, but I did want to circle back around the, the potential motion is written out on the, um.

683
01:05:52,696 --> 01:06:04,045
[SPEAKER_08]: On the, um, agenda, if anybody would like to make that motion now, um, I would be happy to entertain it, but that's up to the committee mayor.

684
01:06:05,699 --> 01:06:07,200
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Chair Graham.

685
01:06:07,601 --> 01:06:11,043
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I do want to thank you, Matt, and the left field team for doing that.

686
01:06:11,063 --> 01:06:25,135
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's important, like Member Graham said, to be able to point that out to people on why we didn't choose X, Y, or Z sites and why we're going to be pursuing the several options with the site we have, which is the largest site of them all.

687
01:06:25,275 --> 01:06:26,576
[SPEAKER_07]: And we want to be able to maximize.

688
01:06:27,957 --> 01:06:32,801
[SPEAKER_07]: the very best for our students and athletes and those in the arts.

689
01:06:33,341 --> 01:06:36,843
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would make move the motion if there are no questions from the committee.

690
01:06:38,484 --> 01:06:39,845
[SPEAKER_08]: So motion by the mayor.

691
01:06:39,905 --> 01:06:43,147
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a second?

692
01:06:45,349 --> 01:06:45,709
[SPEAKER_08]: Second.
