00:00:00,395 --> 00:00:03,576
I'm Yutori Arashi, and welcome to the Mustang Report Talent Show.

2
00:00:03,897 --> 00:00:06,658
First off, we have Jocelyn McCarthy, who's a juggler.

3
00:00:14,041 --> 00:00:16,642
Next, we have Amber Harbison, a world-renowned gymnast.

4
00:00:26,487 --> 00:00:28,728
And now we have Katrina Arashi, a comedian.

5
00:00:31,655 --> 00:00:32,376
Thank you, thank you.

6
00:00:33,937 --> 00:00:36,839
Why did the sesame seed not leave the gambling casino?

7
00:00:37,099 --> 00:00:37,500
Why?

8
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:39,081
Because it was on a roll.

9
00:00:41,463 --> 00:00:42,804
Why did the chicken cross the road?

10
00:00:42,824 --> 00:00:43,945
I don't know.

11
00:00:43,965 --> 00:00:46,167
I forget.

12
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:52,832
Tune in to the 17th Mustang Report to see if the Medford High School Talent Show will be better than ours.

13
00:00:53,413 --> 00:00:53,793
It will be.

14
00:01:01,955 --> 00:01:04,496
Remember the girls hockey team since 7th grade.

15
00:01:05,037 --> 00:01:07,978
With a huge presence on the blue line.

16
00:01:08,038 --> 00:01:10,220
So let's stand as we introduce you.

17
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,241
Big heart, big smile.

18
00:01:14,342 --> 00:01:15,923
Number 15, Ashley Wallace.

19
00:01:16,043 --> 00:01:18,664
At center, number 20, Amy Schreier.

20
00:01:18,724 --> 00:01:22,326
At right wing, number 18, Christina Scholl.

21
00:01:22,486 --> 00:01:26,028
Up against number 15, Ashley Wallace.

22
00:01:26,068 --> 00:01:29,770
At left wing, number 10, Brianna Scholl.

23
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:30,971
Up against number 3, Julia Schreier.

24
00:02:07,899 --> 00:02:10,161
My unique talent is twisting balloon animals.

25
00:02:14,505 --> 00:02:18,309
The Mustang Report question of the week is, what is my special talent?

26
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:36,332
When the glory comes, it will be ours.

27
00:02:36,712 --> 00:02:38,872
It will be ours.

28
00:02:40,153 --> 00:02:48,075
Oh, one day when the war is won, we will be sure.

29
00:02:48,135 --> 00:02:50,656
We will be sure.

30
00:02:51,756 --> 00:02:52,717
Oh, glory.

31
00:02:52,857 --> 00:02:53,737
Glory.

32
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:54,437
Glory.

33
00:02:54,577 --> 00:02:56,458
Oh, glory.

34
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:06,754
Hands to the heavens, no man, no weapon.

35
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:09,337
Formed against, yes, glorious destiny.

36
00:03:09,618 --> 00:03:12,121
Everyday women and men become legends.

37
00:03:12,441 --> 00:03:15,185
Sins that go against our skin become blessings.

38
00:03:15,865 --> 00:03:17,808
The movement is a rhythm to us.

39
00:03:18,008 --> 00:03:19,770
Freedom is like religion to us.

40
00:03:20,876 --> 00:03:23,277
Justice is juxtapositioning us.

41
00:03:23,577 --> 00:03:26,157
Justice for all just ain't specific enough.

42
00:03:26,537 --> 00:03:29,098
One son died, his spirit is revisiting us.

43
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:30,958
True and living, living in us.

44
00:03:30,998 --> 00:03:32,059
Resistance is us.

45
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:34,219
That's why Rosa sat on the bus.

46
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:38,000
That's why we walked through Ferguson with our hands up.

47
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,801
When it go down, we woman and man up.

48
00:03:41,141 --> 00:03:43,761
They say stay down, and we stand up.

49
00:03:44,061 --> 00:03:45,322
Shots, we on the ground.

50
00:03:45,542 --> 00:03:46,622
The camera panned up.

51
00:03:46,722 --> 00:03:49,523
King pointed to the mountaintop, and we ran up.

52
00:03:49,943 --> 00:03:50,703
One day.

53
00:03:50,763 --> 00:04:01,372
One day when the glory comes, it will be ours, it will be ours.

54
00:04:01,652 --> 00:04:11,101
One day when the war is won, we will be sure, we will be sure.

55
00:04:23,232 --> 00:04:25,993
Selma is now for every man, woman, and child.

56
00:04:26,293 --> 00:04:28,993
Even Jesus got his crown in front of a crowd.

57
00:04:29,193 --> 00:04:31,754
They marched with the torch, we gon' run with it now.

58
00:04:32,034 --> 00:04:34,614
Never looked back, we done gone hundreds of miles.

59
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:37,815
From dark roles, heroes, to become a hero.

60
00:04:37,995 --> 00:04:40,776
Facing a league of justice, his power was the people.

61
00:04:41,096 --> 00:04:43,696
Enemy is lethal, a king became regal.

62
00:04:43,896 --> 00:04:46,577
Saw the face of Jim Crow under a bald eagle.

63
00:04:46,757 --> 00:04:47,677
The biggest weapon,

64
00:04:48,317 --> 00:04:49,538
is to stay peaceful.

65
00:04:49,558 --> 00:04:50,159
We sing.

66
00:04:50,419 --> 00:04:52,520
Our music is the cuts that we bleed through.

67
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,743
Somewhere in the dream we had an epiphany.

68
00:04:55,903 --> 00:04:58,205
Now we right the wrongs in history.

69
00:04:58,405 --> 00:05:00,687
No one can win a war individually.

70
00:05:00,747 --> 00:05:04,029
It take the wisdom of the elders and young people's energy.

71
00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:06,831
Welcome to the story we call victory.

72
00:05:06,971 --> 00:05:08,172
The coming of the Lord.

73
00:05:08,232 --> 00:05:09,733
My eyes have seen the glory.

74
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:13,877
One day, when the glory comes,

75
00:05:15,008 --> 00:05:30,123
It will be ours, it will be ours One day, when the war is won We will be sure, we will be sure

76
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,811
Together, together, everyone.

77
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:16,494
Together, together, come on, let's have some fun.

78
00:06:16,534 --> 00:06:20,478
Together, we're there for each other every time.

79
00:06:20,538 --> 00:06:24,681
Together, together, come on, let's do this right.

80
00:06:24,961 --> 00:06:28,104
Here and now, it's time for celebration.

81
00:06:28,124 --> 00:06:30,886
I finally figured out.

82
00:06:31,367 --> 00:06:32,408
Yeah, yeah.

83
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:36,671
That all our dreams have no limitations.

84
00:06:36,691 --> 00:06:38,433
That's what it's all about.

85
00:06:42,365 --> 00:07:00,187
We're special in our own way We make each other strong Each other strong We're not the same We're different in a good way Together's where we belong We're all in this together Once we know

86
00:07:00,467 --> 00:07:12,293
That we are, we're all stars And we see that we're all in this together And it shows when we stand hand in hand Make our dreams come true
