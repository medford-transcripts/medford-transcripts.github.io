53
00:03:08,606 --> 00:03:12,528

54
00:03:14,147 --> 00:03:27,899
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas Amazon has targeted the city of Method expansion of its e-commerce network, and whereas COVID-19 has had a devastating impact on the health, safety, and well-being of the residents of the city of Method.

55
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:41,210
[SPEAKER_04]: And whereas the preventative measures put in place to combat COVID-19 by state and local guidelines to prevent the spread and contain the transmission of the coronavirus have had a devastating

56
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:58,781
[SPEAKER_04]: economic impact on local retail establishments in the city of Methodians have changed the retail options for the residents of the city of Methodians, whereas preventative measures put in place to combat COVID-19, and whereas

57
00:03:59,449 --> 00:04:16,753
[SPEAKER_04]: existing retail and e-commerce delivery networks currently operate in the city of Medford and set community standards for every family with sustaining wages, benefits, including but not limited to quality health insurance and secure retirement.

58
00:04:16,873 --> 00:04:27,735
[SPEAKER_04]: And whereas these retail and e-commerce delivery options coexist in Medford's diverse neighborhoods while adding value to the fabric of the community offering

59
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:32,237
[SPEAKER_04]: good careers for Medford residents to provide for their families.

60
00:04:32,337 --> 00:04:44,542
[SPEAKER_04]: And whereas existing e-commerce delivery options have aptly served the residents of the city of Medford throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, while maintaining the highest standards for its essential workforce.

61
00:04:44,582 --> 00:04:56,186
[SPEAKER_04]: And whereas Amazon, which is not conformed to area standards for wages, benefits, and working condition, has targeted the city of Medford area for expansion of its e-commerce operations.

62
00:04:56,306 --> 00:04:57,927
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, be it resolved,

63
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:27,198
[SPEAKER_04]: that the Memphis City Council, hereby assembled, urges Amazon to meet and confer with the Memphis community, included but not limited to representatives from the International Brotherhood of Teamsters Local 25, locally impacted neighborhood groups, local residents, and other interested parties to discuss how Amazon can expand the delivery options, warehouses, and fulfillment centers in a way that is beneficial to the city of Memphis and its residents while guaranteeing

64
00:05:28,335 --> 00:05:38,041
[SPEAKER_04]: sustainable growth for the city in helping to ensure that fair and equitable employment standards are maintained for all e-commerce delivery networks throughout the city of Memphis.

65
00:05:38,161 --> 00:05:57,353
[SPEAKER_04]: And it be further resolved that prior to any expansion into the city of Memphis, Amazon commits to and presents sufficient evidence to the Memphis City Council that its operation meets or exceeds current standards set by existing e-commerce delivery networks.

66
00:05:58,043 --> 00:06:04,667
[SPEAKER_04]: This commitment would include that all delivery drivers be direct employees of Amazon and not independent contractors.

67
00:06:05,327 --> 00:06:16,794
[SPEAKER_04]: Amazon will ensure that all employee delivery drivers pass the most rigorous background checks, including COVID checks and are compliant with all federal DOT drug testing guidelines.

68
00:06:16,994 --> 00:06:22,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Amazon will only hire competent and safe delivery drivers that will maintain the utmost

69
00:06:25,861 --> 00:06:31,163
[SPEAKER_04]: professional conduct in their day-to-day operation in the neighborhoods of the city of Method.

70
00:06:32,004 --> 00:06:32,544
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

71
00:06:33,584 --> 00:06:34,845
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

72
00:06:34,885 --> 00:06:38,366
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate you bearing with me and going through all of that.

73
00:06:38,626 --> 00:06:41,808
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize for the length of my resolution.

74
00:06:42,608 --> 00:06:47,130
[SPEAKER_03]: However, I think it's a very important issue, and I think it's very important that we take a look at this.

75
00:06:48,511 --> 00:06:54,253
[SPEAKER_03]: It's evident that during government shutdown, Mr. President, we've all become more and more reliant upon e-commerce options.

76
00:06:55,671 --> 00:07:08,444
[SPEAKER_03]: But while e-commerce certainly has its many benefits, the adverse impacts that it's had during the pandemic upon Main Street USA is something many of the businesses here in Medford are never going to recover from.

77
00:07:09,565 --> 00:07:16,653
[SPEAKER_03]: And the expansion of Amazon in particular is negatively impacting the well-being of our community and our local economy.

78
00:07:17,816 --> 00:07:32,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, there were just a number of reported concerns that Amazon's lowering the bar concerning safety standards, misclassifying of employees, failing to pay a living wage, provide health insurance, or secure retirement prospects for their employees.

79
00:07:32,928 --> 00:07:36,231
[SPEAKER_03]: And quite frankly, our community's lost jobs to this mega corporation.

80
00:07:36,931 --> 00:07:43,276
[SPEAKER_03]: And as one of the most profitable corporations in the world, Amazon has a social responsibility to its consumers.

81
00:07:44,157 --> 00:07:56,342
[SPEAKER_03]: the environment of the communities that they service, and most importantly, its workers, to replace jobs lost in our community during this pandemic with opportunities that meet our current community standards and raise the bar, not lower it.

82
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,583
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's not what we're receiving right now, Mr. President.

83
00:07:59,183 --> 00:08:12,248
[SPEAKER_03]: The Memphis City Council's called upon Amazon to appear before us in the past to address the concerns that we have regarding their operational practices, the way their drivers park and drive down the street, the way their drivers aren't properly quarry checked, the size of the vehicles that they're

84
00:08:13,228 --> 00:08:20,773
[SPEAKER_03]: distributing across our neighborhoods, Mr. President, much to the chagrin of many of the residents and the quality of life of us here in Medford.

85
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:34,320
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I ask that my council colleagues support this resolution in calling Amazon to the carpet to address a number of concerns that we have here in the community and raising standards for living people and for working people here in the community, Mr. President.

86
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,541
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd ask my council colleagues to support the resolution.

87
00:08:36,962 --> 00:08:37,562
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

88
00:08:38,566 --> 00:08:38,926
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

89
00:08:39,667 --> 00:08:40,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scott Pelli.

90
00:08:40,848 --> 00:08:41,728
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

91
00:08:41,768 --> 00:08:46,591
[SPEAKER_06]: I thank my fellow colleague and Vice President Knight.

92
00:08:47,032 --> 00:08:52,876
[SPEAKER_06]: I think, not to be redundant, but you hit that right on the button.

93
00:08:53,076 --> 00:09:00,541
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that this is something that we brought forward, something that we look to address in my number one

94
00:09:02,548 --> 00:09:18,857
[SPEAKER_06]: vision with this is the safety and having the responsibility that we put on other entities that use Medford as a place of business.

95
00:09:18,917 --> 00:09:22,078
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that it's a very important

96
00:09:23,179 --> 00:09:24,080
[SPEAKER_06]: piece of this puzzle.

97
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:37,935
[SPEAKER_06]: And as they grow and move forward, I think it's important that we meet with them and make sure they understand where we want them to be and how the city of Medford holds them accountable.

98
00:09:37,975 --> 00:09:43,901
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that you're seeing this across the Commonwealth, there are other communities that are focusing on

99
00:09:45,383 --> 00:09:50,108
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, the feet to the fire, per se, to Amazon.

100
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:52,370
[SPEAKER_06]: And as they're growing, it's great.

101
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:54,432
[SPEAKER_06]: You'd like to see companies grow.

102
00:09:54,472 --> 00:10:04,742
[SPEAKER_06]: But as they come into our community, we want to make sure what cost and making sure that they are licensed correctly, that they are quarried.

103
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:07,644
[SPEAKER_06]: And as they drive our streets and

104
00:10:09,446 --> 00:10:17,733
[SPEAKER_06]: enter our residents that they're people that are safe and follow our laws.

105
00:10:17,773 --> 00:10:26,820
[SPEAKER_06]: So I appreciate Councilor Knight's thoroughness with this presentation and move approval.

106
00:10:28,501 --> 00:10:29,542
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

107
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:30,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Morrell.

108
00:10:30,923 --> 00:10:31,724
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

109
00:10:32,244 --> 00:10:34,606
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I thank Councilors Knight and Scarpelli for bringing this forward.

110
00:10:35,297 --> 00:10:42,902
[SPEAKER_14]: I couldn't agree more that Amazon is really driving a race to the bottom as far as wages and benefits, while also really damaging local businesses.

111
00:10:43,022 --> 00:10:56,751
[SPEAKER_14]: And this also says nothing of their incentivization and really practice of penalties that causes drivers in the area to drive erratically, to stop in the middle of the street, to park against traffic, and really disturb safety in the area.

112
00:10:57,551 --> 00:11:01,634
[SPEAKER_14]: So I thank them for bringing this forward, and I look forward to supporting this paper tonight.

113
00:11:03,235 --> 00:11:04,376
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Council Member.

114
00:11:05,196 --> 00:11:06,217
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr President.

115
00:11:06,517 --> 00:11:10,620
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Vice President Knight for bringing this forward, and I agree with my fellow counselors.

116
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:18,966
[SPEAKER_16]: It's imperative that Amazon is providing good union jobs in our community, especially when they're disrupting so many of our small businesses.

117
00:11:19,626 --> 00:11:23,969
[SPEAKER_16]: And you know, really, as Councilor Morrell said, and Councilor Knight lowering the bar.

118
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:34,597
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm strongly supportive of this, and I do think just a special point needs to be made that their labor practices are really devious, and they're

119
00:11:35,214 --> 00:11:38,978
[SPEAKER_16]: tracking people down to the second, and these workers deserve better.

120
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:41,260
[SPEAKER_16]: They deserve a union and they deserve a living wage.

121
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:44,143
[SPEAKER_16]: So I hope that we can help move this forward as a council.

122
00:11:44,343 --> 00:11:44,703
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

123
00:11:45,584 --> 00:11:46,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Baez.

124
00:11:47,589 --> 00:11:48,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Any further questions.

125
00:11:49,510 --> 00:12:08,925
[SPEAKER_03]: One more thing, Mr. President, I think it's very important to point out that, you know, when we talk about community standards and what we expect here in Medford for employers to do and what it takes to be a good employer, or what it takes to support the rights of workers in the community, we have to also look at the fact that this resolution does speak to asking that Local 25 be involved.

126
00:12:10,446 --> 00:12:18,049
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you look at local 25 the teamsters union and the work they've done related to individuals in the trucking industry and professionals in the trucking industry.

127
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:26,353
[SPEAKER_03]: When we talk about community standards, local 25 help set that bar, Mr. President, when it comes down to a fair living wage when it comes down to.

128
00:12:26,713 --> 00:12:35,482
[SPEAKER_03]: providing health benefits and providing secure retirement prospects for the community, we have to look at the organizations that are in this community that provide people with jobs.

129
00:12:35,522 --> 00:12:38,084
[SPEAKER_03]: And Local 25 is a large employer in the city of Medford.

130
00:12:38,405 --> 00:12:47,494
[SPEAKER_03]: We look at the work that Sean O'Brien does as president of Local 25, a Medford resident, a Medford high school grad, someone that maintains pride in his community, someone that has the blue and white running through his veins.

131
00:12:48,295 --> 00:12:48,515
[SPEAKER_03]: You know,

132
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:53,258
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to respect the work that these individuals have done for Medford in the past.

133
00:12:53,298 --> 00:12:57,920
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why I asked Local 25 to be involved in this process as we go forward, Mr. President.

134
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,642
[SPEAKER_03]: I thank President O'Brien for his leadership in the region.

135
00:13:02,963 --> 00:13:05,965
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I say the region, I don't mean eastern Massachusetts.

136
00:13:08,089 --> 00:13:14,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Eastern United States of America, because he's really helping set the tone and set the bar and raise standards across the country.

137
00:13:14,932 --> 00:13:21,315
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to take an opportunity to also thank Sean O'Brien and the work that he's doing on behalf of the residents in Medford and also across America.

138
00:13:21,735 --> 00:13:22,796
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much to Sean.

139
00:13:23,696 --> 00:13:24,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

140
00:13:24,296 --> 00:13:25,617
[SPEAKER_04]: And if I if I could say something.

141
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:30,483
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to thank Councilor Knight, Vice President Knight, and Councilor Scott Blake for bringing this forward.

142
00:13:31,384 --> 00:13:36,809
[SPEAKER_04]: These men and women who work for Amazon, I know they classify them as independent contractors.

143
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:37,169
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not.

144
00:13:37,549 --> 00:13:40,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Because independent contractors can set their own time.

145
00:13:40,972 --> 00:13:51,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Amazon is a very demanding company, and they set the standard of how these men and women have to work, their hours, and their pay.

146
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,502
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're not independent contractors.

147
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:54,423
[SPEAKER_04]: All Amazon is doing

148
00:13:54,810 --> 00:14:01,714
[SPEAKER_04]: is avoiding paying them workman's comp, and insurance, and a decent living wage, and some type of pension.

149
00:14:01,734 --> 00:14:11,340
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, I also support this, not only for what they do in Medford, but for all the men and women who work for this company throughout the country, not just in Medford.

150
00:14:13,482 --> 00:14:15,983
[SPEAKER_04]: The same thing goes for the Uber and the Lyft guys.

151
00:14:16,364 --> 00:14:21,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Those guys, they're not independent contractors when you're dictated to how you have to work.

152
00:14:22,563 --> 00:14:25,925
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, I thank my councilors for bringing this up and I will be in support of this.

153
00:14:27,186 --> 00:14:27,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President.

154
00:14:29,348 --> 00:14:29,888
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Falco.

155
00:14:30,589 --> 00:14:31,429
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

156
00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:33,450
[SPEAKER_15]: I wanna thank my council colleagues as well.

157
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:36,793
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Knight, Councilor Scott Kelly for bringing this forward.

158
00:14:36,813 --> 00:14:40,115
[SPEAKER_15]: I think Councilor Knight, you hit it on the head in one of the last sentences you made.

159
00:14:40,555 --> 00:14:46,860
[SPEAKER_15]: It's all about raising the bar and I think that this does that and I'll support this 100% and I move approval.

160
00:14:48,841 --> 00:14:50,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Falco.

161
00:14:50,442 --> 00:14:51,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Any further discussion on this?

162
00:14:53,952 --> 00:14:54,613
[SPEAKER_04]: President.

163
00:14:55,653 --> 00:14:56,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Marks.

164
00:14:57,254 --> 00:15:00,556
[SPEAKER_05]: Just if we could, what are the next steps regarding this?

165
00:15:03,378 --> 00:15:09,703
[SPEAKER_04]: We've asked them to appear before us to discuss the issues that have been brought up by the council.

166
00:15:09,763 --> 00:15:16,107
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm sure that the clerk will send this out via registered mail so we know that someone has received it.

167
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,862
[SPEAKER_04]: and have them appear before us.

168
00:15:19,962 --> 00:15:20,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

169
00:15:20,642 --> 00:15:25,624
[SPEAKER_05]: So if they fail to appear in the past, one would think they're probably not gonna appear again.

170
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:29,026
[SPEAKER_05]: So what are the next steps by the city council?

171
00:15:30,527 --> 00:15:36,390
[SPEAKER_05]: I support this, but I wanna support something that has some tea to it and something that we can act upon.

172
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:39,512
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not quite sure that we're there with this.

173
00:15:41,012 --> 00:15:46,974
[SPEAKER_05]: I know the intent, and I support the intent, but I'd like to see some other steps.

174
00:15:47,014 --> 00:15:51,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Waiting for them to come to a meeting, which may never happen, to me is not a next step.

175
00:15:52,376 --> 00:15:53,976
[SPEAKER_05]: But like I said, I am supportive.

176
00:15:54,717 --> 00:15:55,617
[SPEAKER_03]: If I may, Mr. President?

177
00:15:56,425 --> 00:15:57,106
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Knight.

178
00:15:57,746 --> 00:16:07,293
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just one piece in a regional approach that Local 25 is taking and working with the community stakeholders to raise the bar across the region where Amazon is looking to expand.

179
00:16:07,714 --> 00:16:12,197
[SPEAKER_03]: So the next steps would be that, you know, we're going to get community support from communities surrounding Medford.

180
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:14,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Somerville had a resolution on very recently.

181
00:16:15,079 --> 00:16:16,340
[SPEAKER_03]: The city of Boston has as well.

182
00:16:16,901 --> 00:16:24,546
[SPEAKER_03]: The next step, and what my intention would be, would be to coordinate with representatives, the sponsors of those pieces of legislation, as well as the legislative arm of Local 25

183
00:16:25,627 --> 00:16:27,669
[SPEAKER_03]: to begin putting pressure on a dialogue with him.

184
00:16:28,589 --> 00:16:33,793
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the next steps that I'd like to take, Mr. President, and the next steps that have been coordinated through the political arm of Local 25.

185
00:16:35,414 --> 00:16:35,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

186
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:40,858
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Mr. President, are we aware of any particular pieces of legislation that we can look at?

187
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:42,119
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be helpful.

188
00:16:42,779 --> 00:16:45,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we'll look into that and see if we can find anything.

189
00:16:47,082 --> 00:16:53,827
[SPEAKER_04]: We can also refer this to our solicitor also, RKP Law, for their opinion on the next step.

190
00:16:55,102 --> 00:17:12,834
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean some of the things that we can look at Mr. President would be establishing no truck zones, working with the Amazon to be sure that they understand what on resident access only means not using streets or cutthroats then also those other community standards issues that we're discussing where you know we want.

191
00:17:13,468 --> 00:17:17,031
[SPEAKER_03]: The delivery driver that's coming to Medfit is also going to Malden and Winchester and Melrose.

192
00:17:17,051 --> 00:17:25,917
[SPEAKER_03]: So we want to make sure that person's properly quarry checked, properly licensed, and properly trained in the safety standards that are acceptable to us in the region.

193
00:17:26,497 --> 00:17:29,400
[SPEAKER_03]: And the only way that we're going to be able to do that is by coordinating locally.

194
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:38,006
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'm taking the next steps that the stakeholders are able to establish for what they think will work in their individual community and also regionally.

195
00:17:39,026 --> 00:17:39,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Vice President Knight.

196
00:17:39,967 --> 00:17:40,988
[SPEAKER_04]: Any further questions on this?

197
00:17:43,322 --> 00:17:45,363
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see any.

198
00:17:47,224 --> 00:17:47,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Laura Ruma.

199
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:51,425
[SPEAKER_04]: If we can unmute Laura.

200
00:17:53,226 --> 00:17:54,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Clerk, if we can unmute, thank you.

201
00:17:54,826 --> 00:17:55,827
[SPEAKER_04]: I got it, thank you.

202
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:58,468
[SPEAKER_01]: Name and address of the record, please.

203
00:17:58,488 --> 00:17:59,928
[SPEAKER_01]: Laura Ruma, 149 Burgett Ave in Medford.

204
00:18:00,188 --> 00:18:09,772
[SPEAKER_01]: I would just like to mention to the council that we should be very careful with our language here because Amazon actually does bring jobs to the community, as we all know, over on the river.

205
00:18:10,418 --> 00:18:13,621
[SPEAKER_01]: lots of high paying computer programming jobs.

206
00:18:14,121 --> 00:18:19,305
[SPEAKER_01]: So like when we do talk about Amazon, I think it's important to say that there's obviously many branches of Amazon.

207
00:18:19,705 --> 00:18:30,013
[SPEAKER_01]: What issues you're addressing specifically are the delivery drivers and I believe the warehouse of which there's not one in Medford, but could be nearby or could be as we expand.

208
00:18:30,954 --> 00:18:32,935
[SPEAKER_01]: So then there's three businesses to Amazon, right?

209
00:18:32,955 --> 00:18:34,897
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's the jobs that we

210
00:18:36,305 --> 00:18:38,466
[SPEAKER_01]: are happy to have them bring to our community.

211
00:18:38,967 --> 00:18:49,053
[SPEAKER_01]: So just a slight change in the way that we approach this company, who actually does employ a number of people in the area, whether you are a contractor or not.

212
00:18:49,413 --> 00:18:54,916
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other issue, of course, is I understand the union is very aggressive to this.

213
00:18:54,977 --> 00:18:57,038
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanna make sure this is the best thing for Medford now.

214
00:18:58,078 --> 00:18:59,699
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this something that has to be agreed to tonight?

215
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,621
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this an urgent matter?

216
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:02,221
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

217
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:03,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Laura.

218
00:19:04,702 --> 00:19:05,163
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President.

219
00:19:06,535 --> 00:19:07,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Morrell.

220
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:09,016
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

221
00:19:09,196 --> 00:19:23,883
[SPEAKER_14]: I think Laurel brings up a good point in just highlighting how egregious some of Amazon's practices are and that they do seem to understand livable wages and benefits, but only for one tier of their employees and the way that they treat the rest of their employees is truly deplorable.

222
00:19:23,923 --> 00:19:32,186
[SPEAKER_14]: And I just ask, you know, I think we're seeking that all of their employees be treated with the same care they treat those who work in the offices within their company.

223
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:33,287
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

224
00:19:34,751 --> 00:19:40,660
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Vice President Knight is asking mostly about the independent contractors that are in there.

225
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,082
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's really the highlight of it.

226
00:19:42,763 --> 00:19:50,474
[SPEAKER_04]: And I am aware that they do have an office over in Rivers Edge and Cabot Road, and they do employ people there in that office there.

227
00:19:50,494 --> 00:19:50,995
[SPEAKER_04]: So I thank you.

228
00:19:51,765 --> 00:19:52,725
[SPEAKER_03]: right for the discussion.

229
00:19:53,506 --> 00:20:06,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Council President Gabriela I understand that and again, like I said, the jobs that were replacing in the community should not be lowering the bar that should be raising the bar so we're taking jobs away from truck drivers we should be bringing jobs back in truck drivers that met those same community standards.

230
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,871
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, high-tech jobs are high-tech jobs.

231
00:20:08,891 --> 00:20:24,777
[SPEAKER_03]: When we're talking about blue-collar working people that need to get paid a living wage in order to survive in this community, in order to be able to live in this community, in order to have discretionary dollars that they can spend in the local economy here so that we can all rise together, I think it's very important that we focus on those jobs as well.

232
00:20:25,377 --> 00:20:28,318
[SPEAKER_03]: I thank my council colleague, Councilor Scott Pelli, as a co-sponsor.

233
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:29,479
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

234
00:20:30,139 --> 00:20:32,980
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion by Councilor Scott Pelli, seconded by Councilor Knight.

235
00:20:34,161 --> 00:20:35,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

236
00:20:39,095 --> 00:20:39,675
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Behrs?

237
00:20:40,256 --> 00:20:40,516
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

238
00:20:41,336 --> 00:20:42,017
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Falco?

239
00:20:42,337 --> 00:20:42,577
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

240
00:20:43,138 --> 00:20:43,858
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice President Knight?

241
00:20:44,378 --> 00:20:44,639
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

242
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,019
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Marks?

243
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:47,180
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

244
00:20:47,921 --> 00:20:48,581
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Morrell?

245
00:20:48,841 --> 00:20:49,081
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

246
00:20:49,842 --> 00:20:50,622
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Scarpelli?

247
00:20:50,943 --> 00:20:51,203
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

248
00:20:51,663 --> 00:20:52,463
[SPEAKER_07]: President Caravaglia?

249
00:20:53,104 --> 00:20:53,364
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

250
00:20:53,604 --> 00:20:55,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Seven in affirmative, motion passes.

251
00:20:58,127 --> 00:21:02,630
[SPEAKER_04]: 21039 offered by Councilor Behrs, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council

252
00:21:03,715 --> 00:21:16,040
[SPEAKER_04]: and have the Department of Public Works repaint the crosswalks at Winthrop Street and West Street and crossing Winthrop Street just past South Street in the interest of public safety.

253
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:16,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Baez.

254
00:21:18,341 --> 00:21:19,322
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

255
00:21:20,662 --> 00:21:31,067
[SPEAKER_16]: This resolution is put forward, one, because just you can see that the crosswalks there are fading a little bit, but also some resident concerns in the area that

256
00:21:32,031 --> 00:21:43,440
[SPEAKER_16]: the changes at South Street and Main Street might lead to additional car traffic on Winthrop Street, and it's already difficult to cross the street there for pedestrians, and there's a concern that that might get worse.

257
00:21:43,941 --> 00:21:59,714
[SPEAKER_16]: So the intent of this resolution is to make sure the crosswalks are repainted and also to explore the city administration to explore any additional signage or other pedestrian safety measures at this location, just to make sure that residents can cross the street safely.

258
00:21:59,914 --> 00:22:00,234
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

259
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:02,311
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for that point.

260
00:22:03,592 --> 00:22:19,861
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President night for about the last seven weeks now I've been working with the city traffic set the city's traffic engineer to get a couple of signs removed on the corner of South Street, and went for up and these signs are located on that recent complete streets project that was performed.

261
00:22:20,522 --> 00:22:23,744
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a cut out or a bump out right in front of the first house on the corner.

262
00:22:24,713 --> 00:22:41,505
[SPEAKER_03]: And the city in the, their approach to trying to mitigate traffic along South Street, put two signs up one that says 93 and the other one that says 16 right on the corner of South Street and Winthrop Street, probably arm's length distance from the

263
00:22:42,045 --> 00:22:56,411
[SPEAKER_03]: If you were standing on the front porch of the gentleman's home that lives on the corner, he could reach off the front porch and touch the science Mr President, I've made multiple attempts to ask that these signs be relocated or removed in my conversations with the city traffic engineer.

264
00:22:56,731 --> 00:22:57,791
[SPEAKER_03]: He said it's going to happen.

265
00:22:57,991 --> 00:23:01,413
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to see it happen but in an inordinate amount of time has passed Mr President.

266
00:23:02,213 --> 00:23:04,034
[SPEAKER_03]: for these signs to still remain in place.

267
00:23:04,074 --> 00:23:13,577
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd just like to ask Councilor Baez, if he doesn't mind that I offer a B paper, requesting that these signs be relocated as agreed to by the traffic engineer as well.

268
00:23:14,418 --> 00:23:16,938
[SPEAKER_16]: Absolutely, and they're no longer relevant, correct?

269
00:23:17,179 --> 00:23:19,459
[SPEAKER_16]: True, he can't, with the change, so.

270
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:19,980
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

271
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Vice President.

272
00:23:22,761 --> 00:23:23,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Any further questions?

273
00:23:27,282 --> 00:23:28,283
[SPEAKER_02]: Move approval as amended.

310
00:24:42,052 --> 00:24:43,732
[SPEAKER_04]: His presence in our community will be missed.

311
00:24:45,673 --> 00:24:49,174
[SPEAKER_04]: Tom Fahey's been another icon in our community.

312
00:24:49,975 --> 00:24:55,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Councilor Scott Pelley said last week, these icons are passing,

313
00:24:56,327 --> 00:24:58,228
[SPEAKER_04]: and no one is filling their shoes.

314
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:06,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Tom Fahey was a fixture at City Hall for many, many years with the voting office.

315
00:25:06,995 --> 00:25:13,079
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I was the first candidate that came in, he was there all the time.

316
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:16,001
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was still there even after he wasn't on there anymore.

317
00:25:16,541 --> 00:25:16,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Good man.

318
00:25:17,162 --> 00:25:20,504
[SPEAKER_04]: He served our country in World War II and Korean War.

319
00:25:20,784 --> 00:25:24,607
[SPEAKER_04]: He was a member of the Memphis Kiwanis and good community member.

320
00:25:25,543 --> 00:25:33,230
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, like I said, another icon in our community has passed and condolences to his family.

321
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:37,113
[SPEAKER_04]: And I ask that this meeting be held in his honor.

322
00:25:38,694 --> 00:25:39,034
[SPEAKER_04]: President.

323
00:25:40,896 --> 00:25:42,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Max.

324
00:25:43,538 --> 00:25:44,579
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

325
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:47,902
[SPEAKER_05]: And thank you for putting this on the agenda tonight.

326
00:25:48,944 --> 00:25:51,147
[SPEAKER_05]: You couldn't meet a kinder, gentler man.

327
00:25:52,108 --> 00:25:57,255
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, when I first got elected so many years ago, he was one of the first people that I met at City Hall.

328
00:25:57,915 --> 00:26:04,844
[SPEAKER_05]: And in his capacity as the registrar of voters, you know, he was a very fair man, Tom, if you knew him.

329
00:26:05,845 --> 00:26:10,607
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, he took his job very seriously, although he was one that you could talk to.

330
00:26:10,627 --> 00:26:20,470
[SPEAKER_05]: He was old fashioned in that way, that he'd be willing to lend an ear, lend advice, and he always kept conversations to himself.

331
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:29,052
[SPEAKER_05]: and just a true family man and someone that will be sorely missed at City Hall, Mr. President.

332
00:26:29,292 --> 00:26:36,634
[SPEAKER_05]: And I, too, want to send out my deepest condolence to his family and friends, Mr. President.

333
00:26:37,454 --> 00:26:37,894
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

334
00:26:40,595 --> 00:26:41,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Clerk Kirby, did you want to speak?

335
00:26:43,152 --> 00:26:45,655
[SPEAKER_07]: I would love to, Mr. President, if that's appropriate.

336
00:26:45,915 --> 00:26:49,999
[SPEAKER_07]: I just, I wanted to extend my condolences to Faye's family as well.

337
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:59,829
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, before I started as clerk, Tom was incredible to me personally, getting me up to speed on all the election, all the election work that needed to be done.

338
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:09,455
[SPEAKER_07]: in fact, for the first year and a half that I was clerk, he was in the office, in the registrar's or voter's office just about every Wednesday meeting with the team in there.

339
00:27:09,535 --> 00:27:15,798
[SPEAKER_07]: And he was always very good with his time and with his energy and with his passion for the city.

340
00:27:15,878 --> 00:27:17,939
[SPEAKER_07]: And he was a good man.

341
00:27:17,979 --> 00:27:18,860
[SPEAKER_07]: He'll be sorely missed.

342
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,001
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just want to extend my condolences to his family.

343
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:22,142
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

344
00:27:24,083 --> 00:27:24,703
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Falco.

345
00:27:25,617 --> 00:27:27,118
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, President Caviello.

346
00:27:27,218 --> 00:27:29,860
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd also like to send my condolences to the Fahey family.

347
00:27:31,561 --> 00:27:47,973
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Fahey was, like everyone has already said, I mean, very committed to this city, committed to this country as a veteran, and always volunteered, always friendly, very nice to talk to, love to talk to him about city politics and about elections.

348
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:51,215
[SPEAKER_15]: That was his wheelhouse, and he loved that, and he loved talking about it.

349
00:27:51,856 --> 00:27:53,097
[SPEAKER_15]: And he was also,

350
00:27:54,203 --> 00:27:55,104
[SPEAKER_15]: The picture down at St.

351
00:27:55,144 --> 00:28:05,611
[SPEAKER_15]: Francis, you'd see him at mass every Sunday, and he was just an all around great person who was always giving back to the community.

352
00:28:06,431 --> 00:28:08,973
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'd like to offer my condolences to the family.

353
00:28:09,193 --> 00:28:09,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

354
00:28:10,574 --> 00:28:11,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

355
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:13,596
[SPEAKER_04]: Any further questions?

356
00:28:14,496 --> 00:28:15,237
[SPEAKER_04]: Any further discussion?

357
00:28:16,157 --> 00:28:16,918
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

358
00:28:17,158 --> 00:28:18,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Move approval, Mr. President, as amended.

359
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:20,720

00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:36,999
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice President Knight?

[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

380
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:19,811
[SPEAKER_04]: 2-1-0-4-1, offered by Vice President Knight.

381
00:29:24,825 --> 00:29:35,440

00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:05,581
[SPEAKER_04]: And whereas on Monday, December 21st, 2020,

[SPEAKER_04]: And January 20th, 2021, mark the 120th day following this passage of paper 20426.

392
00:31:04,872 --> 00:31:05,132

00:31:12,858 --> 00:31:13,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Six.

397
00:31:42,722 --> 00:31:43,423
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Knight.

398
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

399
00:31:46,601 --> 00:31:55,225
[SPEAKER_03]: This passage of this ordinance is something that this council and previous councils have worked on now dating back to the McGlynn administration.

400
00:31:56,565 --> 00:32:03,589
[SPEAKER_03]: The voters of this community have passed their will, they passed their desire that they'd want to see medicinal recreational marijuana dispensaries legalized in the city of Medford.

401
00:32:04,349 --> 00:32:06,830
[SPEAKER_03]: The council did its due diligence and put together a work product.

402
00:32:07,402 --> 00:32:09,323
[SPEAKER_03]: and that work product was properly vetted.

403
00:32:10,624 --> 00:32:15,546
[SPEAKER_03]: It addressed numerous safeguards for our community and our neighborhoods, and it was sent to the administration.

404
00:32:16,166 --> 00:32:24,310
[SPEAKER_03]: And the administration was confined to a certain deadline as to when this process and procedure was supposed to be implemented and take place, Mr. President.

405
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:27,992
[SPEAKER_03]: We're leaving millions and millions and millions of dollars on the table during a time

406
00:32:28,442 --> 00:32:30,605
[SPEAKER_03]: when our community is facing financial crisis.

407
00:32:31,466 --> 00:32:38,376
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's concerning to me that the administration is not acting on the will of the council and also in the best interest of the community and the will of the voters.

408
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:51,619
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I'd like to have the community, the Cannabis Advisory Commission appear before us next week to provide us with an update as to where we are in the process, as to what exactly is going on with this.

409
00:32:52,659 --> 00:32:54,641
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I know that the Chief of Police is very busy.

410
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:57,102
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that the Director of Health is very busy.

411
00:32:57,163 --> 00:33:00,465
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that the Building Commissioner is very busy, but I think we're all very busy, Mr. President.

412
00:33:00,825 --> 00:33:03,407
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all very busy because we're dedicated public servants.

413
00:33:03,867 --> 00:33:06,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Now the question comes upon being dedicated public servants.

414
00:33:07,288 --> 00:33:11,749
[SPEAKER_03]: It's our duty and responsibility to comply with the timelines and guidelines that are outlined in these ordinances.

415
00:33:12,369 --> 00:33:24,393
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I'd like to see where we are in this whole entire process, because I feel as though once we reach a certain point, the city will begin to see an influx of much needed funds that we can use for necessary program that all of us have talked so much about previously.

416
00:33:24,793 --> 00:33:26,694
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd ask my council colleagues to support the resolution.

417
00:33:28,034 --> 00:33:29,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Vice President Knight.

418
00:33:30,955 --> 00:33:31,615
[SPEAKER_04]: Second the resolution.

419
00:33:33,552 --> 00:33:34,253
[SPEAKER_04]: Any further questions?

420
00:33:35,234 --> 00:33:36,235
[SPEAKER_04]: Second that Mr. President.

421
00:33:37,896 --> 00:33:42,841
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by Councilor Scott Pelli.

422
00:33:43,161 --> 00:33:44,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

423
00:33:45,063 --> 00:33:45,624
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President.

424
00:33:45,904 --> 00:33:48,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sorry, Councilor Mayor, did you have your hand up?

425
00:33:48,687 --> 00:33:56,855
[SPEAKER_16]: I was just wondering, Councilor Knight, have you received any communication from the city administration as, you know, or is the assumption that there's been no commission formed?

426
00:33:57,629 --> 00:34:09,939
[SPEAKER_03]: that my assumption is that the commission's formed by legislative action, but I'm a little concerned about whether or not the commission has established these guidelines within the 90 day time period and again, accepting applications as outlined in the ordinance.

427
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,621
[SPEAKER_03]: Got it.

428
00:34:12,841 --> 00:34:26,593
[SPEAKER_04]: I did speak to the mayor and the chief of staff last week and they said that they were moving forward with this and people should be ready to have

429
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:32,644
[SPEAKER_04]: into being notified within the next two weeks, according to the chief of staff.

430
00:34:34,125 --> 00:34:35,506
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's they, Mr. President?

431
00:34:36,146 --> 00:34:40,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Is they the Cannabis Advisory Commission, or is they the mayor's office?

432
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:42,531
[SPEAKER_04]: The mayor's office.

433
00:34:42,551 --> 00:34:46,954
[SPEAKER_04]: I spoke with the mayor's office about where we were on this and if it was moving forward.

434
00:34:47,014 --> 00:34:48,035
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not their process.

435
00:34:49,055 --> 00:34:49,696
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand that.

436
00:34:50,877 --> 00:34:52,138
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to see where they were.

437
00:34:53,917 --> 00:35:10,720
[SPEAKER_03]: There's this, this council Mr President during the debate discussion and deliberation of the ordinance before us was very concerned about this mysterious conflict of interest that may or may not exist that the mayor received a conflict of interest opinion from an outside attorney that she hasn't shared with anybody.

438
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:15,224
[SPEAKER_03]: relative to some sort of conflict of interest surrounding the application of this ordinance.

439
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:21,689
[SPEAKER_03]: We talked about it at length in the subcommittee meetings, we talked about it at length in the committee of the whole meetings, but we were crafting this ordinance.

440
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:31,037
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's concerning to me, Mr. President, when we have a mysterious, never seen before conflict of interest opinion from a private attorney, which

441
00:35:31,818 --> 00:35:39,721
[SPEAKER_03]: really holds no water because it's not an opinion from the city solicitor who by ordinance is the only person that can give a legal opinion to the mayor or the city council in the city of Medford.

442
00:35:40,361 --> 00:35:40,762
[SPEAKER_03]: Number one.

443
00:35:40,802 --> 00:35:43,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Number two, Mr. President, in fact, a conflict does exist.

444
00:35:47,317 --> 00:35:52,103
[SPEAKER_03]: The Transparency Administration should be telling us what this conflict is and where it exists.

445
00:35:52,744 --> 00:36:02,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Number two, if in fact the ordinance says that the Cannabis Advisory Commission is the entity and body that's supposed to establish this process and procedure,

446
00:36:02,997 --> 00:36:12,665
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason it was structured like that was to keep the administration out of it, because the administration has to come back and negotiate the host community agreement after the recommendations are made from the Cannabis Advisory Commission.

447
00:36:13,105 --> 00:36:24,514
[SPEAKER_03]: So it seems to me, for an ordinance surrounding an issue where the mayor has this expressive, mysterious conflict of interest, she sure has a lot of interest in what goes on with it.

448
00:36:25,195 --> 00:36:26,756
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's very concerning to me, Mr. President.

449
00:36:26,776 --> 00:36:29,098
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we need to look at this a little bit harder than we have.

450
00:36:29,959 --> 00:36:31,500
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that being said, I ask my council call.

451
00:36:33,174 --> 00:36:34,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

452
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:38,265
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by Councilor Scott Belli.

453
00:36:38,285 --> 00:36:39,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Any further questions?

454
00:36:39,788 --> 00:36:40,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President.

455
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:41,451
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Moxley.

456
00:36:43,715 --> 00:36:46,696
[SPEAKER_05]: And I want to thank my colleague, Vice President Knight, for bringing this up.

457
00:36:47,416 --> 00:37:03,462
[SPEAKER_05]: During the deliberation, we were very careful when we selected the 90-day process to allow the Cannabis Advisory Committee to have enough time to do their due diligence and establish the scoring system and the process that they were going to follow.

458
00:37:04,282 --> 00:37:11,525
[SPEAKER_05]: There was originally discussion, if members recall, of a 30-day process, and we didn't think that was adequate enough where you have

459
00:37:11,845 --> 00:37:14,387
[SPEAKER_05]: department heads that have another workload and so forth.

460
00:37:14,687 --> 00:37:17,249
[SPEAKER_05]: So we were very mindful when we set up the 90 days.

461
00:37:18,089 --> 00:37:22,572
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that timeframe should be adhered to, Mr. President.

462
00:37:23,112 --> 00:37:32,038
[SPEAKER_05]: And this process, after a lengthy process over the last couple of years, this should be adhered to, Mr. President, and move forward.

463
00:37:34,499 --> 00:37:34,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

464
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:36,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Any further questions?

465
00:37:37,971 --> 00:37:41,334
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

466
00:37:41,854 --> 00:37:42,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

467
00:37:44,156 --> 00:37:44,736
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Behrs.

468
00:37:45,317 --> 00:37:45,557
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

469
00:37:46,418 --> 00:37:47,098
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Falco.

470
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:47,799
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

471
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:49,300
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice President Knight.

472
00:37:50,361 --> 00:37:50,501
Yes.

473
00:37:51,522 --> 00:37:52,062
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Marks.

474
00:37:52,843 --> 00:37:53,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

475
00:37:54,104 --> 00:37:54,724
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Morrell.

476
00:37:55,205 --> 00:37:55,445
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

477
00:37:56,185 --> 00:37:56,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Scarpelli.

478
00:37:57,226 --> 00:37:57,446
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

479
00:37:58,007 --> 00:37:58,827
[SPEAKER_07]: President Caravaglia.

480
00:37:59,488 --> 00:38:01,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, 70 in the affirmative, motion passes.

481
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:05,653
[SPEAKER_04]: 21042, offered by Vice President Knight.

482
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:29,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas the City of Medford is in the process of conducting an evaluation of the parking practices for review by the Traffic Commission, be it so resolved that the Medford City Council requests that the Traffic Commission examine the feasibility of establishing a temporary overnight parking pass for commercial vehicles that meet the following criteria.

483
00:38:30,069 --> 00:38:30,149
[SPEAKER_04]: One,

484
00:38:30,795 --> 00:38:33,736
[SPEAKER_04]: The applicant is proper licensed to operate the vehicle.

485
00:38:33,896 --> 00:38:38,258
[SPEAKER_04]: Two, the applicant's driver's license indicates MedFed residency.

486
00:38:38,618 --> 00:38:48,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Three, the applicant operates a commercial vehicle that is registered at an owner-occupied residence matching the address on the driver's license.

487
00:38:48,062 --> 00:38:59,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Four, the applicant is in possession of a valid building permit for construction for the owner-occupied residence that matches the address on the driver's license and vehicle registration.

488
00:39:00,897 --> 00:39:28,594
[SPEAKER_04]: The applicant in possession of a valid in driveway construction dumpster permit for the owner-occupied resident that matches the address on the driver's license, vehicle registration and building permit for construction and whereas the intent of this request is to provide, examine an option for temporary relief to a very small subset of residential property owners that meet a very specific set of criteria.

489
00:39:29,074 --> 00:39:30,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it further resolved

490
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:56,219
[SPEAKER_04]: that the Traffic Commission consider safeguards that strike a fair balance between policy and neighborhood impact, including a public hearing process, prior to emissions, a limit on the number of consecutive days and total days in the calendar year, restricting vehicle sizes and requiring that the vehicle be located within a reasonable proximity to the address on the driver's license vehicle registration in the city premise.

491
00:39:58,660 --> 00:39:59,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Knight.

492
00:40:01,385 --> 00:40:02,625
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

493
00:40:02,645 --> 00:40:05,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, thank you for entertaining the length of this resolution.

494
00:40:05,466 --> 00:40:17,671
[SPEAKER_03]: I want it to be very specific and outline what it was I was talking about, because I don't want this to be portrayed as Councilor Knight wants to allow commercial vehicles to park on residential streets, because that's not what this is.

495
00:40:18,391 --> 00:40:25,894
[SPEAKER_03]: What this is, Mr. President, is an opportunity for us to look at a situation, a certain very specific situation, and see if we can provide relief.

496
00:40:26,454 --> 00:40:29,875
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I was contacted by a constituent who lives in the neighborhood.

497
00:40:30,585 --> 00:40:34,672
[SPEAKER_03]: And he lives in a very nice neighborhood, a neighborhood of homes that exceed values of $800,000.

498
00:40:35,273 --> 00:40:40,021
[SPEAKER_03]: And he got a building permit to perform some construction on his home.

499
00:40:40,942 --> 00:40:44,348
[SPEAKER_03]: And as part of this building permit, he also went and he got a dumpster permit.

500
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:51,380
[SPEAKER_03]: And we all know in the city of Medford, there are two types of dumpster permits that you can get in the city of Medford.

501
00:40:51,841 --> 00:40:55,022
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get an in driveway permit, or you can get an on street permit.

502
00:40:55,762 --> 00:40:59,123
[SPEAKER_03]: And this homeowner opted to select an in driveway permit.

503
00:40:59,703 --> 00:41:05,645
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason he opted to select the in driveway permit was, as he felt as though it was more considerate for his neighbors.

504
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:09,694
[SPEAKER_03]: They have 800, $900,000 homes.

505
00:41:09,754 --> 00:41:17,699
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't want to look out their window every day and see a dumpster sitting in the middle of the street, taking up two parking spots that could be very well utilized during the day if the dumpster wasn't there.

506
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:32,610
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's been happening, Mr. President, is because the dumpster is taking up the parking spots in the driveway, and the gentleman is a contractor, an electrician who performs contracting services, and he runs his business out of his home,

507
00:41:35,253 --> 00:41:37,535
[SPEAKER_03]: home and parks his commercial vehicle at his home overnight.

508
00:41:38,455 --> 00:41:57,810
[SPEAKER_03]: He's run into a situation where he's getting tickets for having a commercial vehicle parked on the street overnight, but the reason that the driveway is not open is because he's taken out a permit to perform work on his residential structure, which in the end is going to be beneficial to the neighborhood and to the community, because we're going to be able to capture new growth on the value of the improvements in the

509
00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:06,576
[SPEAKER_03]: in the property, plus the quality of life and public safety issues that are addressed by having the dumpster in the driveway as opposed to on the street.

510
00:42:07,136 --> 00:42:15,102
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a very unique set of circumstances, Mr. President, that I'm hoping the Traffic Commission can take a look at and include as part of their study.

511
00:42:16,443 --> 00:42:23,626
[SPEAKER_03]: in the recommendations that are going to be made by our other little traffic advisory group there that's been established by the mayor.

512
00:42:23,806 --> 00:42:35,610
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that being said, I'm just asking my council colleagues to ask that the traffic commission look at whether or not this is something that they feel would be possible, whether it's not something they feel would be able to be properly administered even.

513
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:45,374
[SPEAKER_03]: It might not be feasible at all, but I did want to make sure that I outlined a very specific subset of criteria and also neighborhood safeguards that could be in place should they wish to pursue it

514
00:42:45,734 --> 00:42:47,074
[SPEAKER_03]: or should they wish to find it feasible.

515
00:42:47,574 --> 00:42:55,836
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that being said, Mr. President, it's nothing more than asking the Traffic Commission a question as to whether or not they feel as though this is a policy that they'd like to adopt or something that might be good for the city of Medford.

516
00:42:56,496 --> 00:42:57,957
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd ask my council colleagues to support it.

517
00:42:59,597 --> 00:42:59,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

518
00:43:01,037 --> 00:43:01,638
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Morrell.

519
00:43:02,338 --> 00:43:03,418
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

520
00:43:03,518 --> 00:43:09,159
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, as the Council Rep on the Commission on Parking Policy Enforcement, I just wanted to highlight an update from this.

521
00:43:09,259 --> 00:43:11,620
[SPEAKER_14]: I spoke with Jim Silva, who's one of the co-chairs of it.

522
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:12,400
[SPEAKER_14]: I see Laurel Ruma.

523
00:43:12,861 --> 00:43:18,184
[SPEAKER_14]: has her hand raised, so I'll also make sure I am brief so she can speak, but the commission is looking.

524
00:43:18,845 --> 00:43:23,888
[SPEAKER_14]: They have been in discussion about commercial vehicles and are looking at surrounding communities as far as how they handle this.

525
00:43:24,928 --> 00:43:36,976
[SPEAKER_14]: The commission, as you know, is made up of residents, members of our business community, and all of their meetings and findings are in a public Zoom, it's not Zoom, I'm sorry, Google Drive that can be accessed.

526
00:43:37,096 --> 00:43:38,697
[SPEAKER_14]: They've spent a lot of time meeting with

527
00:43:39,952 --> 00:43:41,553
[SPEAKER_14]: members of the business community residents.

528
00:43:42,154 --> 00:43:45,897
[SPEAKER_14]: They've met with the five with representatives from the five main business districts.

529
00:43:46,918 --> 00:43:51,482
[SPEAKER_14]: They've identified 15 other small business districts throughout the city that they're seeing participation.

530
00:43:51,502 --> 00:43:56,746
[SPEAKER_14]: They've met in about 62 hours of public open meetings on this.

531
00:43:56,766 --> 00:44:00,509
[SPEAKER_14]: So just to highlight some of the work that is being done, but also the main point being that they are

532
00:44:01,791 --> 00:44:07,305
[SPEAKER_14]: aware of and looking to the commercial vehicle specifically and seeing how other communities address it.

533
00:44:07,326 --> 00:44:10,173
[SPEAKER_14]: So I know Laurel can speak to this more, but I just wanted to share that.

534
00:44:10,454 --> 00:44:10,875
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you.

535
00:44:13,084 --> 00:44:29,579
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, if I may, this is in no way, shape, or form a critique or criticism of the work that this parking commission is doing, ultimately, where the traffic commission is the ultimate policymaking authority, and the traffic commission is doing their diligence anyway.

536
00:44:30,139 --> 00:44:37,546
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason that I asked the traffic commission to examine it would be because this is a council action, so the council would send it to the official government body, the official commission to do the examination.

537
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:39,648
[SPEAKER_03]: I certainly have

538
00:44:40,455 --> 00:44:49,362
[SPEAKER_03]: every belief that the parking enforcement committee that's been established is going to take the proper necessary steps to examine certain aspects of parking in our community.

539
00:44:49,722 --> 00:44:53,705
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is no way, shape or form of a way to be critical of what they're trying to do.

540
00:44:54,325 --> 00:45:04,613
[SPEAKER_03]: However, it's a very specific ask that, you know, that I'm placing on the traffic commission based upon a very stringent set of circumstances and rare criteria that doesn't normally happen here in the community.

541
00:45:05,674 --> 00:45:06,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

542
00:45:06,714 --> 00:45:07,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President,

543
00:45:10,574 --> 00:45:13,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, excuse me, uh, Councilor Marks.

544
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:15,859
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

545
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:23,225
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, I appreciate Councilor Knight bringing this up tonight, uh, where he stated this is a very specific ask.

546
00:45:23,746 --> 00:45:25,668
[SPEAKER_05]: He is a thousand percent correct.

547
00:45:26,328 --> 00:45:34,035
[SPEAKER_05]: And the issue I would have, Mr. President, is that, uh, I would ask that this be properly vetted before it's sent to the traffic commission.

548
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:39,347
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, sent to the public, uh, safety, um, subcommittee.

549
00:45:39,367 --> 00:45:49,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, this has a lot of language in it, Mr. President, that if implemented could have some serious ramifications, uh, to residents in this community.

550
00:45:50,035 --> 00:46:01,419
[SPEAKER_05]: And I understand this is a specific ask for certain things, but as was stated within the last part of this, that the traffic commission consider safeguards as well.

551
00:46:02,059 --> 00:46:08,121
[SPEAKER_05]: And to limit the number of consecutive days, a public hearing take place, restricting vehicle size.

552
00:46:08,821 --> 00:46:13,325
[SPEAKER_05]: how far they can park from a resident, from the address that was given.

553
00:46:13,706 --> 00:46:23,354
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think there's a lot involved with this, and I would hate to send such an important potential change without it properly being vetted.

554
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:28,018
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would ask that we have our due diligence, take a look at it.

555
00:46:29,118 --> 00:46:30,840
[SPEAKER_05]: There may be some language in there that

556
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:35,604
[SPEAKER_05]: the traffic commission runs with, that the council may say, you know what, that wasn't our intent.

557
00:46:36,345 --> 00:46:39,647
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's here in the writing, it's here in the resolution that we supported.

558
00:46:40,228 --> 00:46:45,453
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would ask that we send it to the public safety subcommittee.

559
00:46:46,153 --> 00:46:51,318
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, as was stated, we also have a committee that was put together, commissioned by

560
00:46:51,818 --> 00:46:54,580
[SPEAKER_05]: the mayor that's doing their homework and due diligence.

561
00:46:54,660 --> 00:47:17,852
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe I just read they had over 900 responses so far to the survey that was sent out and that's citywide and I think taking into consideration all these particular questions and concerns and issues that are out there is probably a holistic way of looking at it rather than piecemeal and I would prefer that method but

562
00:47:18,152 --> 00:47:32,320
[SPEAKER_05]: I would respectfully ask my colleague, Vice President Knight, if we can send this to the subcommittee on public safety to have it properly vetted before we send out such a request.

563
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:42,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, the only issue I have with that is that where the council is not the policymaking authority to establish parking policy in the community, the vetting that we're going to conduct would have no implement on the outcome.

564
00:47:43,927 --> 00:47:49,618
[SPEAKER_03]: The traffic commissions the policymaking authority, the council so we could do all the vetting in the world and we can make all the recommendations in the world but

565
00:47:50,404 --> 00:47:54,405
[SPEAKER_03]: What's gonna come out is what comes out of their policymaking authority that's enacted by statute, I believe.

566
00:47:54,465 --> 00:48:12,111
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, we can look at it and say, you know, is there a possibility to enable, to establish a temporary parking permit for commercial vehicles who are conducting home maintenance in an owner-occupied home and let them come up with the safeguards that they want, or we can make recommendations of safeguards, but we're not the policymaking authority.

567
00:48:12,851 --> 00:48:20,153
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, how much time, energy, and effort do we wanna put into vetting something that's not under our scope and purview when we have so much more on our plate to already chew?

568
00:48:21,812 --> 00:48:22,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President.

569
00:48:26,335 --> 00:48:30,338
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate that, and I understand that it is under the authority of the Traffic Commission.

570
00:48:30,718 --> 00:48:41,805
[SPEAKER_05]: However, this is making specific recommendations, and there's at least five recommendations, then other requests of the Traffic Commission that are involved in this process.

571
00:48:42,245 --> 00:48:48,790
[SPEAKER_05]: And all I'm saying is, if I give it my stamp of approval, this was written by, I don't know who, maybe Councilor Naira,

572
00:48:49,270 --> 00:48:51,131
[SPEAKER_05]: came from some other community or so forth.

573
00:48:51,672 --> 00:48:55,814
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't had the opportunity to properly vet it and properly get input.

574
00:48:56,715 --> 00:49:00,037
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think a subcommittee would be the appropriate balance to that.

575
00:49:00,757 --> 00:49:04,780
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand that's not us that's going to implement this and enact this.

576
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:09,643
[SPEAKER_05]: But to get this on the agenda and for the first time, send it.

577
00:49:09,963 --> 00:49:16,788
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to send a basic statement that they look at commercial vehicle overnight parking, I'll support that tonight.

578
00:49:17,188 --> 00:49:24,613
[SPEAKER_05]: But based on what's in here, there are a lot of recommendations in here, and I don't feel comfortable sending them.

579
00:49:24,633 --> 00:49:30,937
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, in the spirit of compromise and to not waste time on an issue that's really asking for an advisory opinion, what I'll do is

580
00:49:31,866 --> 00:49:45,910
[SPEAKER_03]: withdraw the paper and write the traffic commission's chairman under separate cover as an individual, not as a member of the body, asking that they take a look at this and they can take it up or they can not take it up as an individual, as opposed to as a member of the public body.

581
00:49:46,511 --> 00:49:51,132
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe that's something that can get them to take a look at it and still address some of the concerns that the councilors have.

582
00:49:51,632 --> 00:49:56,594
[SPEAKER_03]: But at this time, Mr. President, I'd withdraw the paper, whereas it's not ready for prime time.

583
00:49:57,214 --> 00:50:00,335
[SPEAKER_03]: We can take another look at it at a later date once we get some more information on it.

584
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:06,623
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, on the motion by Vice President Knight that this paper be withdrawn.

585
00:50:06,643 --> 00:50:11,386
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, Laurel, but the council has withdrawn the paper.

586
00:50:12,686 --> 00:50:19,110
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so on the motion by Vice President Knight to withdraw this paper, it is done.

587
00:50:19,130 --> 00:50:21,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

588
00:50:21,972 --> 00:50:22,933
[SPEAKER_04]: Paper has been withdrawn.

589
00:50:22,953 --> 00:50:24,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

590
00:50:24,854 --> 00:50:31,618
[SPEAKER_04]: Admissions, presentations and similar matters.

591
00:50:33,328 --> 00:50:52,674
[SPEAKER_04]: 2-1-0-4-3, petition for a common victim is licensed by Ian McGregor, 125 Willis Avenue, Method, Mass, 02155, and Jeff Wetzel, 523 Main Street, Apartment 2, Method, for Deep Cuts Deli, 572 High Street.

592
00:50:53,935 --> 00:50:57,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Is Mr. McGregor or Mr. Wetzel on the call here?

593
00:50:57,436 --> 00:50:58,136
[SPEAKER_04]: I am.

594
00:50:59,736 --> 00:51:04,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I'll refer this over to the licensing chairman, Councilor Scott Pelli.

595
00:51:05,462 --> 00:51:06,403
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

596
00:51:07,504 --> 00:51:09,506
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have Mr. McGregor, Mr. Wetzel.

597
00:51:09,987 --> 00:51:13,150
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much for choosing Medford.

598
00:51:13,671 --> 00:51:17,835
[SPEAKER_06]: We see all of your paperwork is in order and all approved.

599
00:51:18,536 --> 00:51:21,499
[SPEAKER_06]: And before we go on for approval,

600
00:51:23,347 --> 00:51:31,251
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you, can we have a little insight in what we're trying to do with Deep Cuts Deli and give us a little preview if you can.

601
00:51:37,534 --> 00:51:38,054
[SPEAKER_07]: They muted?

602
00:51:38,835 --> 00:51:41,016
[SPEAKER_07]: They muted?

603
00:51:41,636 --> 00:51:42,696
[SPEAKER_07]: I unmuted Mr. McGregor.

604
00:51:43,117 --> 00:51:44,697
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm unmuted but we can't hear them.

605
00:51:46,846 --> 00:51:47,487
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

606
00:51:48,247 --> 00:51:49,068
[SPEAKER_06]: And we can't hear you.

607
00:51:49,728 --> 00:51:50,529
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you guys hear me now?

608
00:51:50,789 --> 00:51:52,090
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

609
00:51:52,170 --> 00:51:53,531
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

610
00:51:53,551 --> 00:51:53,911
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry.

611
00:51:55,252 --> 00:51:56,073
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi, I'm Ian.

612
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:56,813
[SPEAKER_17]: This is Jeff.

613
00:51:58,054 --> 00:52:01,097
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, yeah, we started Deep Cuts Deli a couple of years ago as a pop-up.

614
00:52:01,657 --> 00:52:07,561
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, I've been booking shows and art shows and music shows and kind of been trying to like make it a community thing.

615
00:52:07,682 --> 00:52:14,907
[SPEAKER_17]: And like, basically the space we're bringing to Medford, uh, besides the sandwiches, also supporting local music and art.

616
00:52:15,581 --> 00:52:25,363
[SPEAKER_17]: and basically having a little space that I can sell sandwiches along with local music and art and have coffee and seltzers and sodas and tea.

617
00:52:27,564 --> 00:52:29,364
[SPEAKER_06]: So you come highly recommended.

618
00:52:29,404 --> 00:52:36,526
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it seems to be a very exciting venture.

619
00:52:36,626 --> 00:52:38,286
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're excited to hear that.

620
00:52:38,686 --> 00:52:42,287
[SPEAKER_06]: So how many employees will you be employed at the location?

621
00:52:43,394 --> 00:52:44,994
[SPEAKER_06]: The moment we have about like six to eight.

622
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:47,375
[SPEAKER_06]: Six to eight in the hours of operations.

623
00:52:47,855 --> 00:52:48,855
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you figured that out yet?

624
00:52:49,495 --> 00:52:49,755
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

625
00:52:49,816 --> 00:52:53,316
[SPEAKER_17]: So to start just because I know like COVID is kind of strange.

626
00:52:53,356 --> 00:52:58,798
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're looking like Tuesday to Friday, 11 to seven and Saturdays 10 to four.

627
00:52:58,818 --> 00:53:00,318
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

628
00:53:01,198 --> 00:53:02,458
[SPEAKER_06]: So I see everything in order.

629
00:53:03,019 --> 00:53:03,719
[SPEAKER_06]: I move approval.

630
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:05,179
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President.

631
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:10,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Any further questions for Mr. McGregor?

632
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:11,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President.

633
00:53:12,301 --> 00:53:12,961
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Vice presidents.

634
00:53:14,110 --> 00:53:14,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. McGregor, how are you?

635
00:53:15,491 --> 00:53:18,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Through you, Mr. President, to Mr. McGregor, thank you for being here this evening.

636
00:53:18,594 --> 00:53:26,421
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have 100% support of voting for this paper that's before us this evening.

637
00:53:26,461 --> 00:53:31,065
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanna preface that before I ask you a series of questions, because I don't want you to get nervous or worried.

638
00:53:31,786 --> 00:53:41,074
[SPEAKER_03]: But one of the things that the council's been doing is taking a look at what we require when people come before us, in terms of what materials and documentation we're requiring,

639
00:53:41,438 --> 00:53:45,842
[SPEAKER_03]: We're looking at special permits and what's required of special permit applicants.

640
00:53:46,323 --> 00:53:54,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, sometimes we get some reports that when you apply for a common victuals license, it's quite an inordinately long process.

641
00:53:54,530 --> 00:53:57,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you just tell me a little bit about your application process?

642
00:53:57,653 --> 00:54:03,539
[SPEAKER_03]: When you first submitted your application, how long it took you to get your approvals after you had your packets submitted and all that stuff?

643
00:54:07,662 --> 00:54:12,304
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I mean, the process was fairly streamlined.

644
00:54:12,364 --> 00:54:17,847
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a number of approvals that we have to get through the town and a number of forms that we have to submit.

645
00:54:19,248 --> 00:54:28,072
[SPEAKER_08]: As far as getting our inspections, those all went in a fairly timely manner, along with our own schedule.

646
00:54:29,393 --> 00:54:35,716
[SPEAKER_08]: So we didn't see any major roadblocks to any of the permitting.

647
00:54:37,882 --> 00:54:43,065
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think the only thing is, I've actually done this in other towns too, so I just don't know.

648
00:54:43,185 --> 00:54:50,628
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a little more paperwork in Medford than there were in some other towns, but it's not a huge issue.

649
00:54:51,769 --> 00:54:55,391
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and so from start to finish, what are you talking, three months, four months?

650
00:54:56,551 --> 00:55:03,755
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we signed our lease on the space for October 1st, so we had a few hiccups with some

651
00:55:05,063 --> 00:55:07,984
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, getting some equipment up and running.

652
00:55:08,424 --> 00:55:12,665
[SPEAKER_08]: But other than that, you know, three months was pretty quick.

653
00:55:13,525 --> 00:55:16,006
[SPEAKER_03]: And do you have your final inspection scheduled with the Board of Health?

654
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:16,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Has that already occurred?

655
00:55:17,646 --> 00:55:18,926
[SPEAKER_08]: It happened last Wednesday.

656
00:55:19,947 --> 00:55:20,867
[SPEAKER_03]: And everything was all set?

657
00:55:21,627 --> 00:55:21,807
Yep.

658
00:55:21,907 --> 00:55:23,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

659
00:55:24,288 --> 00:55:24,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

660
00:55:24,968 --> 00:55:27,528
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate both your time and answering the questions.

661
00:55:29,769 --> 00:55:30,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

662
00:55:30,589 --> 00:55:34,090
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a couple of questions for Ian and Jeff.

663
00:55:35,393 --> 00:55:38,114
[SPEAKER_04]: I looked up on your website, you have a couple of other locations?

664
00:55:39,215 --> 00:55:49,059
[SPEAKER_17]: We've opened and we've done a lot of pop-ups and we had a spot in Winter Hill area and it kind of fell through due to COVID.

665
00:55:49,779 --> 00:55:59,463
[SPEAKER_17]: And then we met Steven who owns a building in West Bedford and kind of like changed course on that and the whole takeout delivery aspect.

666
00:56:01,044 --> 00:56:02,965
[SPEAKER_17]: But yeah, this is the only location at the moment.

667
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:07,061
[SPEAKER_04]: And I welcome you to the neighborhood.

668
00:56:07,541 --> 00:56:11,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, I wasn't able to visit the establishment before.

669
00:56:11,582 --> 00:56:19,263
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not a vegan, but I think I can make my way down to your new restaurants and hope to see you there.

670
00:56:20,464 --> 00:56:21,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

671
00:56:21,584 --> 00:56:22,044
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

672
00:56:22,544 --> 00:56:23,965
[SPEAKER_08]: Any further questions?

673
00:56:24,865 --> 00:56:28,946
[SPEAKER_08]: So this was great for us to be able to find a spot in Bedford.

674
00:56:29,226 --> 00:56:29,606
[SPEAKER_04]: It was great.

675
00:56:29,626 --> 00:56:29,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

676
00:56:30,711 --> 00:56:32,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Congratulations, welcome to this method.

677
00:56:32,892 --> 00:56:34,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Any further questions for Ian and Jeff?

678
00:56:35,693 --> 00:56:36,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Move approval.

679
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:41,556
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, on the motion by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Falco.

680
00:56:42,116 --> 00:56:43,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:15,784
[SPEAKER_04]: I will turn this over to the Chairman of Licensing, Councilor Scott Kelly.

728
00:58:16,845 --> 00:58:17,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

729
00:58:21,239 --> 00:58:23,600
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Shaheed, that's a great motto.

730
00:58:24,381 --> 00:58:25,041
[SPEAKER_06]: I follow that.

731
00:58:25,061 --> 00:58:25,621
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

732
00:58:25,881 --> 00:58:26,522
[SPEAKER_06]: Work hard.

733
00:58:29,443 --> 00:58:33,105
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, I see all the paperwork is in order.

734
00:58:33,785 --> 00:58:42,990
[SPEAKER_06]: And before we move approval, would you like to give us a little look, see what we're going to be, we're going to be treated for here in Medford soon?

735
00:58:43,570 --> 00:58:43,930
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

736
00:58:43,990 --> 00:58:47,952
[SPEAKER_10]: So what caught me good was, starting in 2018, I was a,

737
00:58:50,425 --> 00:59:00,758
[SPEAKER_10]: construction worker and it was hard to find a good meal delivery company to deliver like healthy meals to any job site that I was at.

738
00:59:01,138 --> 00:59:05,139
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's when I came up, me and my fiance came up with work hard, eat good.

739
00:59:05,539 --> 00:59:10,840
[SPEAKER_10]: So we've been in Cambridge for a little while, but due to the COVID-19, we moved to Medford.

740
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,060
[SPEAKER_10]: It was closer to my house.

741
00:59:12,521 --> 00:59:20,642
[SPEAKER_10]: So what we do is we are an online mail delivery service, and we deliver hot meals to job sites at lunchtime.

742
00:59:21,463 --> 00:59:22,963
[SPEAKER_10]: The customer will go on the app.

743
00:59:23,672 --> 00:59:27,595
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no indoor dining coming to the restaurant.

744
00:59:27,635 --> 00:59:33,900
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to order online, and you order before 10, and you get your meal delivered at lunchtime.

745
00:59:34,781 --> 00:59:38,484
[SPEAKER_10]: We are targeting police department, fire department.

746
00:59:38,504 --> 00:59:41,286
[SPEAKER_10]: We're doing hospital.

747
00:59:41,306 --> 00:59:49,293
[SPEAKER_10]: We're actually going to donate a couple females to the hospital in the area just to kind of let them know what's going on and offer, you know, because they

748
00:59:49,773 --> 00:59:52,335
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, due to COVID-19, they've been, you know, doing hard work.

749
00:59:52,355 --> 00:59:57,438
[SPEAKER_10]: So I definitely want to offer meals to the two local hospitals.

750
00:59:57,719 --> 01:00:02,382
[SPEAKER_10]: We actually, one of our market plan is to target City Hall.

751
01:00:02,682 --> 01:00:06,965
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm hoping that, you know, that y'all will like the food that we offer.

752
01:00:07,265 --> 01:00:17,452
[SPEAKER_10]: But like I said, we are a lunchtime online delivery service where you order before 10 and you get your meal dropped off at lunchtime.

753
01:00:18,111 --> 01:00:20,273
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so your hours or operations and days?

754
01:00:21,294 --> 01:00:24,717
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really, so I'm near from 7 until 12.

755
01:00:25,158 --> 01:00:31,664
[SPEAKER_10]: So at 12 o'clock is the end time, 12 o'clock in the afternoon.

756
01:00:31,944 --> 01:00:35,387
[SPEAKER_10]: But we're going to extend that time later, but right now it's just from 7 to 12.

757
01:00:35,507 --> 01:00:37,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

758
01:00:37,369 --> 01:00:38,310
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I said, I see everything.

759
01:00:38,330 --> 01:00:41,493
[SPEAKER_06]: I know some of my colleagues have questions, but I see everything.

760
01:00:41,533 --> 01:00:43,295
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the concept is innovative.

761
01:00:44,301 --> 01:00:48,702
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish you luck, but before we approve, Mr. President, do you have any questions?

762
01:00:49,122 --> 01:00:50,903
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that your motto, work hard and eat good, Judge?

763
01:00:52,143 --> 01:00:52,843
[SPEAKER_06]: What is it?

764
01:00:53,063 --> 01:00:53,864
[SPEAKER_06]: That's your motto, right?

765
01:00:54,184 --> 01:00:57,004
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm starting my own construction company so they can deliver.

766
01:00:59,265 --> 01:01:01,085
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it's not only a construction company.

767
01:01:01,145 --> 01:01:03,826
[SPEAKER_10]: It's anybody that work hard deserve to eat good.

768
01:01:04,126 --> 01:01:05,187
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's everybody.

769
01:01:05,787 --> 01:01:07,107
[SPEAKER_07]: We eat good.

770
01:01:07,167 --> 01:01:07,927
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't tell my wife.

771
01:01:08,607 --> 01:01:10,328
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice President Knight.

772
01:01:11,390 --> 01:01:12,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

773
01:01:12,691 --> 01:01:24,520
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I'm hearing is this sounds more like a commissary location where the food's prepared, packaged, and then you use that as a delivery hub where you get everything ready and packed up at that location.

774
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:33,687
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you go and take it out and deliver it to the community just like you'd be a delivery driver based on basically fulfilling the orders that you had received previously that morning.

775
01:01:33,887 --> 01:01:34,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, sir.

776
01:01:34,788 --> 01:01:35,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, sir.

777
01:01:35,528 --> 01:01:36,489
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

778
01:01:36,989 --> 01:01:38,971
[SPEAKER_03]: And how many trucks do you operate out of this location?

779
01:01:39,493 --> 01:01:40,934
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, right now we have two.

780
01:01:41,614 --> 01:01:41,794
[SPEAKER_03]: Two.

781
01:01:42,515 --> 01:01:42,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

782
01:01:43,195 --> 01:01:44,256
[SPEAKER_03]: And do you have any employees?

783
01:01:45,957 --> 01:01:46,978
[SPEAKER_10]: Five at the moment.

784
01:01:47,358 --> 01:01:47,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Five at the moment.

785
01:01:48,439 --> 01:01:54,462
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just because I'm going over your application and I'm looking at, you know, and I think it's a great concept and it's something that I'll support.

786
01:01:55,463 --> 01:01:58,705
[SPEAKER_03]: It says that you don't carry any workers' compensation insurance.

787
01:02:00,022 --> 01:02:06,004
[SPEAKER_10]: No, because so we got a loan from because when I was in Cambridge, we had five workers that we hoping to bring back.

788
01:02:06,464 --> 01:02:09,385
[SPEAKER_10]: So right now it's just me and my fiance.

789
01:02:09,665 --> 01:02:15,367
[SPEAKER_10]: But once we get back up and running, because we were supposed to have a grand opening February the first that got pushed back.

790
01:02:15,707 --> 01:02:21,929
[SPEAKER_10]: So we are we are in the midst of bringing all our five five back and employees back on.

791
01:02:21,989 --> 01:02:23,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so you understand your obligations then?

792
01:02:24,470 --> 01:02:25,231
[SPEAKER_03]: once you have employees.

793
01:02:25,371 --> 01:02:26,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

794
01:02:26,653 --> 01:02:37,264
[SPEAKER_03]: And lastly, similar to the question that I asked the previous individuals that were before us, from start to finish, how long did it take for you to get the permitting application and all that stuff put together?

795
01:02:37,404 --> 01:02:41,669
[SPEAKER_03]: And once you submitted your permit, how long did it take for you to get to this point where you're at tonight?

796
01:02:42,699 --> 01:02:46,783
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, it didn't take as long as the last previous.

797
01:02:47,444 --> 01:02:51,207
[SPEAKER_10]: It took me less than a month.

798
01:02:51,567 --> 01:02:57,293
[SPEAKER_10]: And I like Medford the way because you're very professional, you make sure that everything was done right.

799
01:02:57,573 --> 01:03:04,399
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't even know I needed my Vendiglia license because I had my catering permit and my

800
01:03:05,865 --> 01:03:06,486
[SPEAKER_10]: food permit.

801
01:03:06,846 --> 01:03:12,371
[SPEAKER_10]: And then when I went to get my, um, business license, I was told I needed my vendor grill license.

802
01:03:12,671 --> 01:03:16,254
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was wondering, and, um, you know, cause I don't sell food out of there.

803
01:03:16,294 --> 01:03:21,399
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't do, um, indoor dining, but I liked it how it didn't matter.

804
01:03:21,699 --> 01:03:24,221
[SPEAKER_10]: You still had to, you know, get your vendor grill license.

805
01:03:24,782 --> 01:03:30,146
[SPEAKER_10]: And it made me, um, you know, appreciate the Metro area, you know, it's going to be professional.

806
01:03:30,467 --> 01:03:31,628
[SPEAKER_10]: Everything has to be done right.

807
01:03:32,228 --> 01:03:40,334
[SPEAKER_10]: no matter if it's not a big company or a small company, I guess that this is the procedure to make sure that everything's done right.

808
01:03:41,875 --> 01:03:45,477
[SPEAKER_10]: But it only took me three weeks actually to get it.

809
01:03:45,517 --> 01:03:47,618
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was a very quick process.

810
01:03:48,199 --> 01:03:50,020
[SPEAKER_10]: I was nervous and I'm still nervous.

811
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:52,342
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think you have anything to be nervous about.

812
01:03:53,242 --> 01:03:55,864
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm glad that the process worked out well for you.

813
01:03:56,084 --> 01:04:00,287
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much for sharing your experience and you have my support this evening.

814
01:04:01,374 --> 01:04:02,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, sir.

815
01:04:02,114 --> 01:04:02,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

816
01:04:02,755 --> 01:04:04,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Any more questions for Gabriel?

817
01:04:06,096 --> 01:04:06,836
[SPEAKER_04]: I have one question.

818
01:04:06,856 --> 01:04:10,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Gabriel, so are you delivering just to businesses?

819
01:04:10,277 --> 01:04:12,898
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't deliver to homes?

820
01:04:14,098 --> 01:04:14,778
[SPEAKER_10]: Not at the moment.

821
01:04:14,838 --> 01:04:15,619
[SPEAKER_10]: Not at the moment.

822
01:04:15,999 --> 01:04:18,920
[SPEAKER_10]: I think businesses would be a better

823
01:04:20,945 --> 01:04:38,056
[SPEAKER_10]: to begin, you know, and because businesses hold a lot of people for right now, but after we get out, I've been wanting, you know, if, if, if, if I could, I would like to, um, to deliver the homes and maybe, uh, like an office will call you and maybe 10 or 12 meals.

824
01:04:38,076 --> 01:04:39,697
[SPEAKER_04]: You're looking to bring to one location, correct?

825
01:04:40,518 --> 01:04:41,938
[SPEAKER_10]: We do up to 850 meals.

826
01:04:41,958 --> 01:04:42,659
[SPEAKER_10]: Good for you.

827
01:04:43,099 --> 01:04:44,800
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

828
01:04:45,541 --> 01:04:48,943
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, any further questions for, uh, Gabriel approval?

829
01:04:49,455 --> 01:04:53,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, on the motion by, who seconded that?

[SPEAKER_04]: 21046, to the Honorable President and members of the Memphis City Council.

855
01:05:43,444 --> 01:05:53,814

856

[SPEAKER_04]: and $149,878.98 from the General Reserve to the Methodist Historical Commission for phase one of the implementation of the Brooks Master Plan.

858
01:06:20,519 --> 01:06:22,859
[SPEAKER_04]: We wanna do this one at a time or you wanna do it as a whole?

859
01:06:25,660 --> 01:06:26,140
[SPEAKER_03]: One at a time.

860
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:27,721
[SPEAKER_03]: Practice has always been one at a time.

861
01:06:28,101 --> 01:06:28,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.

862
01:06:29,381 --> 01:06:29,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

863
01:06:30,662 --> 01:06:30,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

864
01:06:31,342 --> 01:06:32,502
[SPEAKER_04]: Roberta, are you in on this call?

865
01:06:33,783 --> 01:06:34,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Roberta Cameron here?

866
01:06:35,005 --> 01:06:36,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Danielle Evans is from the city.

867
01:06:36,706 --> 01:06:39,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Danielle, are you here?

868
01:06:39,427 --> 01:06:40,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Danielle is, there she is.

869
01:06:41,588 --> 01:06:42,828
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, okay, okay.

870
01:06:42,908 --> 01:06:44,429
[SPEAKER_04]: If we can unmute Danielle.

871
01:06:47,010 --> 01:06:47,550
[SPEAKER_04]: She's unmuted.

872
01:06:48,171 --> 01:06:48,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, thank you.

873
01:06:49,611 --> 01:06:50,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Danielle.

874
01:06:50,652 --> 01:06:51,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address of the record, please.

875
01:06:52,853 --> 01:06:57,015
[SPEAKER_13]: Danielle Evans, community preservation coordinator.

876
01:06:57,535 --> 01:07:01,196
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think we discussed this last week.

877
01:07:02,297 --> 01:07:04,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have any further questions on this before we vote?

878
01:07:05,962 --> 01:07:09,883
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe that you had some outstanding questions regarding the Thomas Brooks Park.

879
01:07:10,723 --> 01:07:29,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, and I see we got, we have a letter from the mayor through the public works saying that the City of Method Department of Public Works has reviewed the Thomas Brooks Park master plan with the parks department and enthusiastically supports the proposed improvement.

880
01:07:30,286 --> 01:07:34,587
[SPEAKER_04]: The historical commission will have full support to assist with the implementation of phase one

881
01:07:35,285 --> 01:07:39,367
[SPEAKER_04]: work as submitted to the Community Preservation Committee.

882
01:07:39,687 --> 01:07:42,388
[SPEAKER_04]: We appreciate the advance notice of work.

883
01:07:42,768 --> 01:07:46,890
[SPEAKER_04]: No further sign off is required from the Public Works or the Parks Department.

884
01:07:47,290 --> 01:07:56,734
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to me, Ryan Kevins, Commissioner of Public Works, and Michael Nestor, Parks Division.

885
01:08:01,095 --> 01:08:02,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Any questions from the Council?

886
01:08:02,836 --> 01:08:03,236
[SPEAKER_04]: President.

887
01:08:04,397 --> 01:08:04,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Mox.

888
01:08:06,014 --> 01:08:06,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

889
01:08:08,196 --> 01:08:11,918
[SPEAKER_05]: And I want to thank whoever got us that information.

890
01:08:11,938 --> 01:08:13,279
[SPEAKER_05]: That was very helpful.

891
01:08:13,999 --> 01:08:17,642
[SPEAKER_05]: The question actually that I asked was the jurisdiction.

892
01:08:18,502 --> 01:08:26,468
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's my belief that the jurisdiction of Thomas Brooks PAC falls under the PAC's commission.

893
01:08:27,488 --> 01:08:32,772
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was wondering if this has been presented for a formal vote to the PAC's commission.

894
01:08:33,527 --> 01:08:38,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Not the PAC's department or public works, but the PAC commission.

895
01:08:41,413 --> 01:08:42,554
[SPEAKER_04]: I cannot answer.

896
01:08:42,574 --> 01:08:44,475
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just reading off the letter that was given to me.

897
01:08:44,495 --> 01:08:47,457
[SPEAKER_04]: It was sent out by the mayor's office.

898
01:08:48,978 --> 01:08:50,399
[SPEAKER_04]: I do not have that answer.

899
01:08:50,499 --> 01:08:50,920
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

900
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:54,762
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see anybody from the administration.

901
01:08:54,782 --> 01:08:58,145
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would respectfully ask, Mr. President,

902
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:12,492
[SPEAKER_05]: that if we do take a vote tonight, I'm prepared to take a vote, but the vote will be contingent upon, and this is for the dig itself, the approval by the Parks Commission.

903
01:09:13,433 --> 01:09:25,304
[SPEAKER_05]: This subject should be before the Parks Commission for approval, Mr. President, and let them decide whether or not they approve it or not, Mr. President.

904
01:09:25,985 --> 01:09:35,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so you want to amend the paper to say that this before we will approve it with the condition that it's approved by the park commission.

905
01:09:37,153 --> 01:09:45,259
[SPEAKER_05]: I would ask that, you know, if we wanted to vote on tonight, I have no problem with that, but I'll vote be contingent upon approval by the park commission.

906
01:09:45,659 --> 01:09:45,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

907
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:47,661
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

908
01:09:47,781 --> 01:09:49,582
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we have supporting documentation.

909
01:09:50,163 --> 01:09:53,905
[SPEAKER_05]: from Brian Cairns and from Mike Nesta.

910
01:09:54,625 --> 01:10:01,529
[SPEAKER_05]: However, as far as I know, this falls under the jurisdiction of the Park Commission and the issue rightfully should be presented to them.

911
01:10:02,409 --> 01:10:02,750
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

912
01:10:03,330 --> 01:10:04,050
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Knight.

913
01:10:05,531 --> 01:10:08,092
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, Councilor Moxley is 100% right.

914
01:10:08,112 --> 01:10:13,055
[SPEAKER_03]: If you look at the City of Medford's ordinances, you'll see Section 6

915
01:10:15,032 --> 01:10:20,655
[SPEAKER_03]: The book commission is still exercise all the duties assigned under Massachusetts general laws, chapter 45.

916
01:10:20,755 --> 01:10:37,643
[SPEAKER_03]: And it also says that the public city losing council or maybe used or known.

917
01:10:40,304 --> 01:10:43,066
[SPEAKER_03]: With that being said, Mr. President, I'm not so comfortable.

918
01:10:44,623 --> 01:10:51,028
[SPEAKER_03]: given up and making an appropriation of any funds without at first going through the proper channels outlined by city ordinance.

919
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:53,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

920
01:10:55,572 --> 01:10:57,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Ryan Hayward has a brain you had your hand up.

921
01:11:00,096 --> 01:11:00,837
[SPEAKER_04]: Ryan, you still there.

922
01:11:04,540 --> 01:11:05,080
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's gone.

923
01:11:08,259 --> 01:11:09,620
[SPEAKER_13]: I think, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

924
01:11:09,900 --> 01:11:11,041
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, Danielle.

925
01:11:11,361 --> 01:11:12,042
[SPEAKER_04]: Ryan's here now.

926
01:11:12,482 --> 01:11:13,063
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, Ryan.

927
01:11:13,203 --> 01:11:14,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address of the record, please.

928
01:11:15,705 --> 01:11:19,167
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure, Ryan Hayward, Medford Historical Commission, 40 Sheridan Ave in Medford.

929
01:11:19,748 --> 01:11:31,276
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to point out that on the letter, you know, that we sent over, that Jen, the chair of the Historical Commission sent, down the very bottom, we did consult with Danielle DeRusso from the Parks Commission.

930
01:11:31,917 --> 01:11:36,900
[SPEAKER_09]: They working, you know, we, Danielle and,

931
01:11:38,370 --> 01:11:39,551
[SPEAKER_09]: and, um.

932
01:11:42,634 --> 01:11:56,666
[SPEAKER_09]: Roberta Cameron and her and I all met via Zoom to discuss this issue, and she seemed to think that the Parks Commission doesn't normally review this type of activity, that it would be up to the mayor's office and the administration to approve it.

933
01:11:56,706 --> 01:12:02,971
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm, you know, I'm certainly happy to go through that channel if you guys want to have us, you know, send it over to the Parks Commission.

934
01:12:03,011 --> 01:12:06,414
[SPEAKER_09]: The mayor is already working on that, so we can certainly

935
01:12:07,089 --> 01:12:08,893
[SPEAKER_04]: What information, Mr. President?

936
01:12:09,214 --> 01:12:11,640
[SPEAKER_04]: What information, Councilor Marks?

937
01:12:12,382 --> 01:12:14,066
[SPEAKER_05]: And I thank Ryan for his comment.

938
01:12:14,166 --> 01:12:16,091
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't think anyone's opposed to this.

939
01:12:16,592 --> 01:12:19,494
[SPEAKER_05]: we just wanna make sure we're following the proper protocol.

940
01:12:20,134 --> 01:12:26,977
[SPEAKER_05]: And I had a conversation just recently within the past maybe hour, an hour and a half with one of the park commission members.

941
01:12:27,658 --> 01:12:29,899
[SPEAKER_05]: And they said they had a number of questions.

942
01:12:30,819 --> 01:12:34,201
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, they were asking me the questions I couldn't answer.

943
01:12:34,821 --> 01:12:41,285
[SPEAKER_05]: And they were surprised that it wasn't before the park commission for a formal vote.

944
01:12:41,745 --> 01:12:44,587
[SPEAKER_05]: So I really think that we need to revisit this.

945
01:12:45,007 --> 01:12:48,890
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, I have no problem voting contingent upon their approval.

946
01:12:49,470 --> 01:12:57,776
[SPEAKER_05]: But as long as I've been on the council, anything done on park property has always come under the jurisdiction of the park commission.

947
01:12:58,296 --> 01:13:00,658
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't see this as any different, Mr. President.

948
01:13:01,259 --> 01:13:03,760
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we have to follow the proper protocols.

949
01:13:04,561 --> 01:13:05,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Really, that should have been the first step.

950
01:13:06,422 --> 01:13:15,364
[SPEAKER_05]: before, you know, coming to the council, but I have no problem moving forward with it if we make it contingent upon approval by the Park Commission.

951
01:13:16,344 --> 01:13:16,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

952
01:13:18,284 --> 01:13:18,664
[SPEAKER_05]: Danielle?

953
01:13:21,085 --> 01:13:35,727
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I was just going to say exactly what Mr. Harrod had said, that we had met with Danielle DeRusso, who is the CPC, is the delegate from the Parks Commission, and she did not seem to think that that was under their purview, but

954
01:13:36,405 --> 01:13:41,547
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, we did have a legal opinion and I see Roberta Cameron is here.

955
01:13:41,567 --> 01:14:01,034
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, it was, it was the last from Mark Rumley who, um, Roberta knows that one better off the top of her head, but he had opined that the parks commission didn't have, um, didn't need to give permission for that type of work.

956
01:14:01,414 --> 01:14:04,235
[SPEAKER_13]: And, um, I don't know if you could,

957
01:14:07,132 --> 01:14:13,607
[SPEAKER_05]: When you say that type of work, when you're talking about digging in a park,

958
01:14:14,750 --> 01:14:24,679
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I can't see any more of a reason why you'd go to a park commission, Mr. President, and ask for their blessing, you know?

959
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:33,928
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, I realize the Thomas Brooks Park is kind of off the beaten track and not fully utilized, but this could be any park that they request.

960
01:14:33,988 --> 01:14:35,870
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be the middle of place that park.

961
01:14:36,230 --> 01:14:38,953
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would assume you'd want to follow the same proper protocols

962
01:14:39,333 --> 01:14:40,094
[SPEAKER_05]: and procedures.

963
01:14:40,834 --> 01:14:42,536
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just don't understand.

964
01:14:43,256 --> 01:14:46,499
[SPEAKER_05]: If that's the case, maybe I'll go pick up a shovel and start digging in our box.

965
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:49,362
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it doesn't make any sense to me, Mr. President.

966
01:14:51,043 --> 01:14:51,423
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

967
01:14:51,623 --> 01:14:51,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

968
01:14:52,104 --> 01:14:52,464
[SPEAKER_04]: President.

969
01:14:52,484 --> 01:14:52,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President.

970
01:14:58,178 --> 01:15:08,643
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're also going down a slippery slope and we're relying on the legal opinion of the CPC representative from the Pax Commission to make a determination, the solicitor.

971
01:15:08,683 --> 01:15:13,365
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, we have a outside council that the city has been relying upon so much.

972
01:15:14,145 --> 01:15:19,328
[SPEAKER_03]: We apparently have ample legal minds to address a concern or a question like this.

973
01:15:19,368 --> 01:15:21,609
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe we should get that answer before we move forward.

974
01:15:24,970 --> 01:15:25,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

975
01:15:25,871 --> 01:15:26,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Daniel.

976
01:15:29,505 --> 01:15:29,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

977
01:15:30,406 --> 01:15:32,289
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, did you want?

978
01:15:32,309 --> 01:15:34,131
[SPEAKER_13]: I think Roberta had something to say.

979
01:15:34,151 --> 01:15:39,077
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, uh, Roberta name and address the record, please.

980
01:15:39,918 --> 01:15:44,264
[SPEAKER_12]: Roberta Cameron 12 North Street from the Community Preservation Committee.

981
01:15:44,852 --> 01:16:06,598
[SPEAKER_12]: So as Danielle just referred to, we have a legal opinion that was provided to us by former city solicitor, Mark Rumley, where he rendered an opinion on the legal authority of the Park Commission, specifically finding that the Park Commission does not have to approve any and all capital projects within parks and playgrounds.

982
01:16:07,258 --> 01:16:09,979
[SPEAKER_12]: The legal opinion stated that the

983
01:16:14,512 --> 01:16:24,719
[SPEAKER_12]: Parks Commission does not have the authority to prove any and all capital improvements within parks and playgrounds, but that authority rests with the mayor.

984
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:27,201
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of information, Mr. President.

985
01:16:27,541 --> 01:16:28,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of information, Councilor Marks.

986
01:16:29,162 --> 01:16:39,649
[SPEAKER_05]: When we're comparing apples to oranges, you're talking about a capital plan, which clearly the Park Commission wouldn't have the authority to do any type of capital plan because they don't control the purse strings.

987
01:16:40,009 --> 01:16:44,192
[SPEAKER_05]: What we're talking about is the jurisdiction to have someone go onto park property

988
01:16:44,592 --> 01:16:47,435
[SPEAKER_05]: and start excavating on park property, Mr. President.

989
01:16:47,916 --> 01:16:50,298
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say that needs approval by the Park Commission.

990
01:16:50,859 --> 01:17:04,393
[SPEAKER_05]: And even if it didn't, Mr. President, at the very least, before money's approved, that should have been vetted out by the Park Commission, whose sole responsibility is the oversight of the park, Mr. President, and the safety of our parks.

991
01:17:04,873 --> 01:17:08,937
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we don't know what's going to happen when they start excavating, Mr. President.

992
01:17:09,197 --> 01:17:12,720
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't know if it's going to be cordoned off accordingly.

993
01:17:13,021 --> 01:17:14,362
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't know any of this.

994
01:17:14,802 --> 01:17:23,411
[SPEAKER_05]: And the park commission, the commissioner that I spoke to tonight, had a lot of questions on what type of vehicles would be used in there and so forth.

995
01:17:23,791 --> 01:17:27,775
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think at the very least, Mr. President, where they're the commission,

996
01:17:28,275 --> 01:17:38,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, if this was a CPC thing and someone said you didn't have to go to CPC for it, I would fight for the fact that CPC should be involved if it was something that's under their jurisdiction.

997
01:17:38,723 --> 01:17:40,364
[SPEAKER_05]: This is no different, Mr. President.

998
01:17:40,665 --> 01:17:47,910
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't think we should circumvent an established commission in the... I don't know why we'd do it, Mr. President.

999
01:17:48,791 --> 01:17:54,895
[SPEAKER_05]: I think all the members are probably on board, but they really have questions from a member I spoke to.

1000
01:17:54,915 --> 01:17:57,037
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1001
01:17:59,370 --> 01:18:01,271
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, any further questions?

1002
01:18:02,111 --> 01:18:02,672
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President?

1003
01:18:04,292 --> 01:18:04,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Morrell?

1004
01:18:05,973 --> 01:18:23,661
[SPEAKER_14]: I do wonder if the desire is to add this language, this contingency is to add the word if, just indicating if it is within the parks commission authority, because I do know we sent a paper last week asking for a sign off for the school committee for something that actually was not within their duty, it was the duty of principals.

1005
01:18:23,781 --> 01:18:27,663
[SPEAKER_14]: So just not getting us kind of stuck in a place if this actually is not

1006
01:18:28,896 --> 01:18:29,959
[SPEAKER_14]: under the Parks Commission.

1007
01:18:29,979 --> 01:18:31,966
[SPEAKER_03]: Point of information, Mr. President.

1008
01:18:32,367 --> 01:18:33,892
[SPEAKER_03]: Point of information, Vice President Knight.

1009
01:18:34,965 --> 01:18:43,309
[SPEAKER_03]: The response we received back from the administration wasn't necessarily reflective of the policy that was adopted by the school committee in the prior years.

1010
01:18:44,230 --> 01:18:47,591
[SPEAKER_03]: I know the opinion is what it is and what came from the school department is what it is.

1011
01:18:47,671 --> 01:18:56,756
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that if we go back and take a longer how to look at what was actually said at those meetings when they were talking about donations, that a policy was enacted.

1012
01:18:56,796 --> 01:19:00,237
[SPEAKER_03]: So look, you know, the question was, we want to take a look at that policy and see what it is.

1013
01:19:00,918 --> 01:19:01,558
[SPEAKER_03]: But I for one,

1014
01:19:02,807 --> 01:19:06,169
[SPEAKER_03]: don't feel comfortable appropriating any money unless we're sure we're doing it legally.

1015
01:19:06,189 --> 01:19:07,210
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that doesn't make any sense.

1016
01:19:07,230 --> 01:19:14,936
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't we get the confirmations that we need to properly vet the issue and make a vote that's rooted in the basis of, you know.

1017
01:19:17,497 --> 01:19:18,258
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Morrell.

1018
01:19:19,699 --> 01:19:20,419
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm good, thank you.

1019
01:19:20,439 --> 01:19:21,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.

1020
01:19:22,441 --> 01:19:23,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Any further questions?

1021
01:19:23,161 --> 01:19:26,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, hold on.

1022
01:19:26,524 --> 01:19:27,464
[SPEAKER_14]: I see some hands waving.

1023
01:19:33,850 --> 01:19:38,752
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see who's waving a hand here.

1024
01:19:39,472 --> 01:19:42,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Tau, name and address for the record.

1025
01:19:45,275 --> 01:19:45,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you hear me?

1026
01:19:46,875 --> 01:19:47,055
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1027
01:19:47,095 --> 01:19:48,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address for the record, please.

1028
01:19:54,338 --> 01:19:55,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Can someone unmute him?

1029
01:19:56,179 --> 01:19:58,720
[SPEAKER_16]: I think he needs to unmute himself.

1030
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:00,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that better?

1031
01:20:01,261 --> 01:20:01,381
[SPEAKER_16]: Yep.

1032
01:20:02,159 --> 01:20:03,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much, Councillor Beers.

1033
01:20:04,940 --> 01:20:07,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Can someone there explain to me- Name and address of the record, please, sir.

1034
01:20:08,501 --> 01:20:10,981
[SPEAKER_02]: Andrew Castanetti, East Medford.

1035
01:20:12,222 --> 01:20:13,402
[SPEAKER_04]: When did you change your name, Andrew?

1036
01:20:14,282 --> 01:20:14,642
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry?

1037
01:20:15,363 --> 01:20:16,243
[SPEAKER_04]: When did you change your name?

1038
01:20:18,103 --> 01:20:19,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.

1039
01:20:19,844 --> 01:20:22,104
[SPEAKER_02]: It's this technical stuff, excuse me.

1040
01:20:23,545 --> 01:20:31,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Can someone there simply please explain what this phase one expenditure is on the Thomas Brooks Park

1041
01:20:31,947 --> 01:20:32,768
[SPEAKER_02]: master plan?

1042
01:20:32,848 --> 01:20:34,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there other phases beyond this?

1043
01:20:35,169 --> 01:20:36,570
[SPEAKER_02]: And what is the total cost?

1044
01:20:36,650 --> 01:20:39,511
[SPEAKER_02]: And what is this all being spent for, please?

1045
01:20:40,712 --> 01:20:42,653
[SPEAKER_04]: Roberta, you wanna answer the question for the gentleman?

1046
01:20:44,634 --> 01:20:57,622
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure, so phase one includes, so first of all, there was a master plan that the CPC funded last year that the historical commission oversaw for improvements to Thomas Brooks Park.

1047
01:20:58,142 --> 01:20:58,903
[SPEAKER_12]: Phase one,

1048
01:20:59,763 --> 01:21:15,270
[SPEAKER_12]: is the implementation of that master plan, including the restoration of Pomp's Wall, or also known as the Slave Wall, and restoration of a stone wall that runs the length of the park.

1049
01:21:16,010 --> 01:21:19,091
[SPEAKER_12]: And it also includes the archaeological

1050
01:21:21,062 --> 01:21:30,450
[SPEAKER_12]: excavation of some areas of the site that have been determined to be of high probability for having historical artifacts.

1051
01:21:31,011 --> 01:21:43,442
[SPEAKER_12]: And this archaeological excavation is required before any other work can be undertaken on the park in order to protect any artifacts that might be located on the site.

1052
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:49,421
[SPEAKER_12]: And your other question was about future phases.

1053
01:21:49,761 --> 01:21:57,865
[SPEAKER_12]: The future phases, I can speak to that personally, that they are identified within the plan that was developed.

1054
01:21:58,345 --> 01:22:02,367
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that that can be accessed through the Historical Commission's website.

1055
01:22:02,707 --> 01:22:11,190
[SPEAKER_12]: And also the application for their project includes some future work that they've identified to be done on the site.

1056
01:22:11,810 --> 01:22:15,932
[SPEAKER_12]: So that can also be found in the records on our website.

1057
01:22:17,406 --> 01:22:18,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Roberta.

1058
01:22:18,688 --> 01:22:21,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Andrew, does that answer your question?

1059
01:22:21,832 --> 01:22:23,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for your time.

1060
01:22:24,015 --> 01:22:24,456
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1061
01:22:25,057 --> 01:22:26,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Any further discussion on this?

1062
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:27,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President.

1063
01:22:28,281 --> 01:22:29,163
[SPEAKER_04]: Any more hands up?

1064
01:22:30,004 --> 01:22:30,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President.

1065
01:22:31,366 --> 01:22:32,127
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Knight.

1066
01:22:33,533 --> 01:22:40,357
[SPEAKER_03]: I do believe that the council does have the prerogative to either appropriate the requested sum or reduce the requested sum.

1067
01:22:41,277 --> 01:22:51,003
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe we could reduce the requested sum by the amount that the excavation will cost and allow the applicant to come back to us at a later date once we get our questions answered, number one.

1068
01:22:51,804 --> 01:22:55,646
[SPEAKER_03]: Number two, I keep hearing that the wall's called Pop's Wall, right?

1069
01:22:55,666 --> 01:22:56,407
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the name of the wall?

1070
01:22:57,622 --> 01:22:59,203
[SPEAKER_03]: So why do we keep calling it the Slave Wall?

1071
01:22:59,463 --> 01:23:01,144
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't we call it what the wall's named?

1072
01:23:01,444 --> 01:23:03,145
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do we keep referring to it as Slave Wall?

1073
01:23:03,345 --> 01:23:04,345
[SPEAKER_03]: Slave Wall, Slave Wall.

1074
01:23:04,385 --> 01:23:06,206
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's Pop's Wall, why aren't we calling it Pop's Wall?

1075
01:23:06,927 --> 01:23:07,807
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?

1076
01:23:07,927 --> 01:23:11,909
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is that the message that we wanna deliver in Drill Home, that it's Slave Wall when it's Pop's Wall?

1077
01:23:11,929 --> 01:23:12,750
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called Pop's Wall.

1078
01:23:13,150 --> 01:23:14,330
[SPEAKER_03]: And it has a history behind it.

1079
01:23:14,390 --> 01:23:22,615
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that, you know, the history that's behind it, that, you know, might be a little bit more interesting to people if they say Pop's Wall, why is it called that?

1080
01:23:22,775 --> 01:23:23,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's learn about it.

1081
01:23:24,235 --> 01:23:26,537
[SPEAKER_03]: As opposed to the thing being called Slave Wall, especially,

1082
01:23:27,778 --> 01:23:33,982
[SPEAKER_03]: based upon the tenor of what's going on in America and Massachusetts and in the area these days, Mr. President.

1083
01:23:34,002 --> 01:23:36,083
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd just like to put that out there as a non sequitur.

1084
01:23:37,083 --> 01:23:49,671
[SPEAKER_03]: But with that being said, I wouldn't be opposed to appropriating the funds that are necessary to repair the wall and withhold the funds that are necessary to perform the excavation, if that's a direction that we wanna go in.

1085
01:23:49,691 --> 01:23:55,354
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd offer that out there for my councils to discuss and debate so that we can move on to some of the next items on the list.

1086
01:23:56,246 --> 01:23:57,807
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, Councilor Bez.

1087
01:23:58,327 --> 01:23:58,667
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1088
01:23:58,747 --> 01:24:16,298
[SPEAKER_16]: And just to Councilor Knight's point, I think it's great that, you know, we're finally going to be calling this Pomp's Wall and putting the name to the person who built it, because I can remember even, you know, I think it was 2002 when we were doing projects, you know, in the third grade about Medford Historical Sites, it was called the Slave Wall.

1089
01:24:16,338 --> 01:24:18,539
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think we learned about Pomp

1090
01:24:19,075 --> 01:24:25,321
[SPEAKER_16]: But I think it's really, I think it's good that this whole project will move the sign, allow access to the wall and give it the proper name.

1091
01:24:25,401 --> 01:24:27,043
[SPEAKER_16]: So I thank you for raising that point.

1092
01:24:28,344 --> 01:24:30,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Any further questions?

1093
01:24:32,008 --> 01:24:32,568
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President?

1094
01:24:33,589 --> 01:24:34,110
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Rao?

1095
01:24:34,470 --> 01:24:43,299
[SPEAKER_14]: Supporting information and Danielle may be able to speak this and maybe why she has her hand raised, but it's my understanding that in order for the work to be done, it is a requirement by the Massachusetts Historical

1096
01:24:43,844 --> 01:24:52,010
[SPEAKER_14]: commission that this has to be excavated first before the work on Palms Wall or the Fieldstone Wall can go forward.

1097
01:24:53,811 --> 01:24:55,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Danielle, you commented that?

1098
01:24:55,813 --> 01:24:56,613
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, Mr. President.

1099
01:24:56,633 --> 01:25:00,916
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to clarify that this is due diligence that the state is requiring.

1100
01:25:01,417 --> 01:25:04,419
[SPEAKER_13]: It's been identified as an archaeologically sensitive area.

1101
01:25:04,439 --> 01:25:12,485
[SPEAKER_13]: So you can't start doing work to repair the wall and to relocate the plaque

1102
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:17,542
[SPEAKER_13]: without having done some excavation.

1103
01:25:17,562 --> 01:25:21,544
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's not like getting like a backhoe, it's like very delicate.

1104
01:25:22,164 --> 01:25:39,011
[SPEAKER_13]: It's gonna be volunteers basically making sure that they're not disturbing anything, or if they have a find, then to call in the appropriate people to properly excavate and dig it up.

1105
01:25:40,108 --> 01:25:46,814
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, preserve the artifacts that they may find in the ground since there was a former home there.

1106
01:25:48,735 --> 01:25:50,437
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's actually a requirement, yeah.

1107
01:25:50,517 --> 01:25:50,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1108
01:25:51,658 --> 01:25:52,919
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for the clarification.

1109
01:25:53,219 --> 01:25:53,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Any further questions?

1110
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:57,622
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a question by someone, Ms.

1111
01:25:57,662 --> 01:25:58,323
[SPEAKER_12]: Diaso.

1112
01:26:00,044 --> 01:26:02,466
[SPEAKER_04]: Sharon, are you there?

1113
01:26:03,267 --> 01:26:04,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Sharon, did you have a question?

1114
01:26:05,889 --> 01:26:07,350
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I did, Councilman.

1115
01:26:07,390 --> 01:26:09,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Sharon, name and address of the record, please.

1116
01:26:09,791 --> 01:26:10,752
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, I forgot.

1117
01:26:10,872 --> 01:26:14,334
[SPEAKER_00]: Sharon Diesso, 130 Circuit Road in Medford, Mass.

1118
01:26:15,055 --> 01:26:19,337
[SPEAKER_00]: Greetings to all councilmen and councilwomen, and thank you for the time, President Carviello.

1119
01:26:20,498 --> 01:26:31,565
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some real, I think, important views about what's being done by this commission right now, conservation.

1120
01:26:32,285 --> 01:26:33,466
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a history minor.

1121
01:26:34,306 --> 01:26:35,527
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a history advocate.

1122
01:26:36,312 --> 01:26:37,172
[SPEAKER_00]: I teach still.

1123
01:26:38,593 --> 01:26:48,376
[SPEAKER_00]: I am abashed and so are some people with the amount of monies that are being distributed to commissions of this sort in a COVID time.

1124
01:26:49,176 --> 01:26:50,756
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a couple of suggestions.

1125
01:26:50,916 --> 01:26:52,257
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it can be done.

1126
01:26:53,037 --> 01:27:05,741
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really amazed that during this time, the council has not presented information on how many people in this city have lost their jobs, who have come forth or gone to churches

1127
01:27:06,545 --> 01:27:10,008
[SPEAKER_00]: pleading for some help or going to the city hall for some help.

1128
01:27:10,609 --> 01:27:13,451
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, not regarding privy, etc.

1129
01:27:15,453 --> 01:27:17,095
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're just writing checks out for $350,000.

1130
01:27:20,889 --> 01:27:44,444
[SPEAKER_00]: has its conservation directorship, by any chance during the year, sought out to the wonderful colleges that we have nearby, Tufts, UMass Lowell, UMass Boston, Boston University, who would love to work on a site like that, probably at a much, much better reduced price, what a marvelous graduate paper that could be.

1131
01:27:44,845 --> 01:27:47,767
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm amazed that we put everything in your hands.

1132
01:27:48,247 --> 01:27:49,588
[SPEAKER_00]: We're very, very shocked.

1133
01:27:50,088 --> 01:28:08,209
[SPEAKER_00]: We feel that this should be number one, either reduced or the commissions of this sort during COVID should be asked by the city council to please stall any of these projects if graduate work can't be put on these jobs to the spring.

1134
01:28:08,814 --> 01:28:10,875
[SPEAKER_00]: people out there need these monies.

1135
01:28:11,275 --> 01:28:15,958
[SPEAKER_00]: And artifacts, if we're not careful, people in the city will become artifacts.

1136
01:28:16,338 --> 01:28:24,062
[SPEAKER_00]: You already got approval for a second historic room at the library, but over almost a quarter of a million dollars.

1137
01:28:24,662 --> 01:28:32,106
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe your funds aren't exhausted yet, but it's gotta make the voting, go to petition again about allotting you money next voting time.

1138
01:28:32,707 --> 01:28:35,308
[SPEAKER_00]: A very healthy new year to all.

1139
01:28:35,368 --> 01:28:36,789
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for your time.

1140
01:28:38,183 --> 01:28:38,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Sharon.

1141
01:28:39,244 --> 01:28:42,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Sharon, only $15,000 was for the day.

1142
01:28:42,827 --> 01:28:52,254
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know if they've looked at volunteer work, but unfortunately, this money is put aside for these projects.

1143
01:28:53,055 --> 01:28:57,619
[SPEAKER_04]: And unfortunately, it can't go to the COVID relief and things like that.

1144
01:28:57,679 --> 01:28:59,280
[SPEAKER_04]: And I understand where you're coming from.

1145
01:28:59,300 --> 01:29:04,784
[SPEAKER_04]: But this money is earmarked for these type of projects by

1146
01:29:06,243 --> 01:29:09,886
[SPEAKER_04]: the vote on by the people who voted for the Community Preservation Act.

1147
01:29:10,386 --> 01:29:15,049
[SPEAKER_04]: So I hope that answers some of your question.

1148
01:29:17,131 --> 01:29:18,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Any further questions?

1149
01:29:20,593 --> 01:29:32,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so we have a motion for the requesting of the appropriation of the $300,000 that was amended by Councilor Marks that it just be

1150
01:29:33,165 --> 01:29:38,684
[SPEAKER_04]: approved contingent on the park commission making their recommendations.

1151
01:29:40,023 --> 01:29:44,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Mike, is there any, Councilor, did you have something on there you wanted to put on it also?

1152
01:29:44,584 --> 01:29:52,566
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd prefer, Mr. President, that if we're gonna proceed, we earn the side of caution and make sure that we take a vote that's confident and rooted in the legal basis.

1153
01:29:52,726 --> 01:29:55,767
[SPEAKER_03]: And if in fact we're moving, I mean, can we even do that?

1154
01:29:55,907 --> 01:30:00,288
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we even take a vote that says that it's contingent upon something else happening somewhere else once we appropriate the money?

1155
01:30:00,308 --> 01:30:01,168
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we ever gonna get it back?

1156
01:30:01,208 --> 01:30:02,208
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they gonna, you know what I mean?

1157
01:30:02,608 --> 01:30:05,069
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not too confident that the administration is gonna adhere.

1158
01:30:06,456 --> 01:30:11,482
[SPEAKER_03]: to the contingencies that we're putting in place based upon some of the conversations that we've already had earlier in the night.

1159
01:30:11,502 --> 01:30:22,576
[SPEAKER_04]: You know- If someone wants to make a motion to table number one, we can entertain that.

1160
01:30:22,637 --> 01:30:25,320
[SPEAKER_04]: So the chair awaits a motion from the floor.

1161
01:30:29,798 --> 01:30:40,046
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, my recommendation would be to table the matter until approval from the Park Commission is garnered or the city solicitor provides us with an opinion saying that this project isn't subject to their approval.

1162
01:30:41,707 --> 01:30:50,533
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a motion by Councilor Knight that this be tabled until the Park Commission makes their recommendation.

1163
01:30:51,814 --> 01:30:55,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Or the city solicitor determines that this type of project isn't subject to their purview.

1164
01:30:55,917 --> 01:30:56,898
[SPEAKER_03]: Or the city solicitor.

1165
01:30:59,733 --> 01:31:00,574
[SPEAKER_06]: Question, Mr. President.

1166
01:31:01,575 --> 01:31:02,375
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scott Pelli.

1167
01:31:03,256 --> 01:31:13,966
[SPEAKER_06]: To really Roberta, if we came back and visited this next week, this wouldn't, I wanna move forward with this, but I understand my colleague's reservations.

1168
01:31:14,447 --> 01:31:20,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it waiting a week would be, would that really hinder anything for this vote, this portion?

1169
01:31:22,795 --> 01:31:23,415
[SPEAKER_12]: Waiting a week?

1170
01:31:24,322 --> 01:31:38,695
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think we'll hinder it, but waiting a month may make it difficult, or waiting more than a month, I'm not sure how long it takes, will make it difficult for the timeline of the project to be able to be carried out.

1171
01:31:40,812 --> 01:31:48,719
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor, would Councilor Light be opposed to putting a date certain so we can get the information back from the city?

1172
01:31:49,720 --> 01:31:51,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Certainly not, Mr. President.

1173
01:31:51,161 --> 01:32:04,392
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, the reason there is the issue is because, you know, we're the fiduciary, you know, we're the ones that are responsible for the... And, you know, I just really think it's important that, you know, at all...

1174
01:32:05,549 --> 01:32:08,051
[SPEAKER_03]: of all the jobs and responsibilities that we have as a council.

1175
01:32:08,651 --> 01:32:11,594
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the most significant, you know, spending a taxpayer's dollars.

1176
01:32:12,114 --> 01:32:15,657
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the spending of taxpayer dollars that's above and beyond the assessment of the property tax.

1177
01:32:16,077 --> 01:32:22,802
[SPEAKER_03]: So I really think it's important that we do it the right way and that we get the question answered once and for all so we don't run into these circumstances again in the future.

1178
01:32:23,603 --> 01:32:28,807
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know when the next meeting of the park board is.

1179
01:32:28,827 --> 01:32:30,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Does anybody know when the next meeting is?

1180
01:32:30,948 --> 01:32:31,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Two weeks.

1181
01:32:32,229 --> 01:32:32,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Two weeks.

1182
01:32:34,525 --> 01:32:36,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Roberta, is that a hindrance to weeks?

1183
01:32:37,626 --> 01:32:43,407
[SPEAKER_12]: I just wanted to see if Ryan Hayward wanted to say something about the schedule of the project.

1184
01:32:44,267 --> 01:32:45,808
[SPEAKER_09]: Ryan, did you want to pipe into this?

1185
01:32:47,048 --> 01:32:52,089
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I just, you know, I'm happy to roll with consulting with the parks commission.

1186
01:32:53,209 --> 01:32:55,810
[SPEAKER_04]: So you don't have a problem?

1187
01:32:56,190 --> 01:32:57,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion being certain.

1188
01:32:58,380 --> 01:33:20,969
[SPEAKER_03]: motion to table this is for a date certain after the park board meeting after the park board meetings commission meeting right yeah that would be my recommendation if my counselors agree you know getting the opinion from the solicitor i think is important so that um next year or next round when this question comes up again we don't have the same discussion we have the document right before us thank you

1189
01:33:21,305 --> 01:33:32,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so on the motion by Councilor Knight, that this be tabled for an opinion from the city solicitor and discussion by the park board for their recommendation.

1190
01:33:33,351 --> 01:33:34,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I have a second?

1191
01:33:34,712 --> 01:33:36,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, I have to withdraw my motion first.

1192
01:33:38,173 --> 01:33:39,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, yeah.

1193
01:33:41,268 --> 01:33:47,209
[SPEAKER_04]: So Council Marks had an approval, so are you withdrawing your motion?

1194
01:33:47,229 --> 01:33:48,729
[SPEAKER_04]: I am withdrawing the motion, Mr. President.

1195
01:33:48,829 --> 01:34:02,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so Council Marks has withdrawn his motion, and we're gonna stick with, we're gonna re-table it until we get an opinion from the city solicitor and an opinion from the park commission, is that correct?

1196
01:34:03,552 --> 01:34:04,332
[SPEAKER_04]: That's correct to me.

1197
01:34:04,992 --> 01:34:06,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, do I have a second on that?

1198

1246
01:35:59,066 --> 01:36:13,757

[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1264
01:36:44,747 --> 01:36:44,967
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1265
01:36:45,508 --> 01:36:46,268
[SPEAKER_07]: President Caravaglia?

1266
01:36:46,628 --> 01:36:46,808
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1267
01:36:47,408 --> 01:36:48,428
[SPEAKER_04]: The motion passes.

1268
01:36:48,688 --> 01:36:50,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Number four, requesting

1269
01:36:50,839 --> 01:37:00,923
[SPEAKER_04]: the appropriation of $60,000, excuse me, from the CPA Housing Reserve to ABCD for Medford move-in program.

1270
01:37:01,643 --> 01:37:02,804
[SPEAKER_16]: Move approval, Mr. President.

1271
01:37:03,724 --> 01:37:07,125
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion by Councilor Behrs, seconded by Councilor Knight.

1272
01:37:07,365 --> 01:37:07,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President.

1273
01:37:09,886 --> 01:37:10,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President.

1274
01:37:10,506 --> 01:37:10,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President.

1275
01:37:15,768 --> 01:37:17,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Seems like my connection is unstable.

1276
01:37:18,149 --> 01:37:19,510
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, did you start from the beginning again?

1277
01:37:20,610 --> 01:37:23,131
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so he said it looks like I was shaken out there.

1278
01:37:24,191 --> 01:37:36,434
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have some concern, Mr. President, and it's not going to stand in my way of supporting this paper this evening because, quite frankly, we don't have an entity that provides this type of service, servicing the residents of our community right now.

1279
01:37:37,294 --> 01:37:48,957
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you review the appropriations that we're making to Action for Boston Community Development and the homelessness prevention initiatives that we're supporting, we're seeing that the eligibility

1280
01:37:49,717 --> 01:37:59,123
[SPEAKER_03]: requirements and the people that are calling for services, about 70% of those people are being turned away because they're not eligible for services because they don't reside in the city of Medford.

1281
01:37:59,663 --> 01:38:05,687
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think a lot of that has to do with the fact, Mr. President, that ABCD is Action for Boston Community Development.

1282
01:38:06,187 --> 01:38:14,552
[SPEAKER_03]: And while they are filling a void in this community, I think more people in this community would be inclined to call the Medford Housing Authority for assistance or the Medford Housing Authority for help.

1283
01:38:17,644 --> 01:38:28,990
[SPEAKER_03]: with Director Driscoll over there about potentially expanding their programming and their services to deliver this type of service that we're seeing here through ABCD.

1284
01:38:29,030 --> 01:38:30,911
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's something I'm very excited about, Mr. President.

1285
01:38:31,732 --> 01:38:40,736
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, in looking at the type of service that we're seeing ABCD perform in this community, we are seeing a duplication of efforts because we do have our,

1286
01:38:42,117 --> 01:38:53,485
[SPEAKER_03]: The office, the Metro Consumer Advisory Commission, located in City Hall on the first floor, is also handling certain aspects of eviction and raft application implementation with the raft program.

1287
01:38:54,135 --> 01:39:18,775
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's very important, Mr. President, as we move forward and begin to further disperse funds related to affordable housing and housing in general, that we take a look at possibly expanding our relationship with the Medford Housing Authority to develop a much more city-specific program that really works for us, where 70% of the people that are calling aren't being turned away because the resources are not meeting the eligibility requirements.

1288
01:39:19,515 --> 01:39:25,599
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, when you think about a housing need or someone that's looking for help regarding housing, the first place they call is the housing authority.

1289
01:39:26,420 --> 01:39:31,583
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that that might be a great spot for us to really start focusing our efforts and expanding this type of programming.

1290
01:39:31,603 --> 01:39:48,453
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I just wanted to add my two cents and put forward a B paper requesting that the housing authority and the Medford Consumer Advisory Commission report back to the council what steps and efforts they've taken in expanding their rental assistance and eviction assistance programming that they have here in the community.

1291
01:39:49,791 --> 01:39:51,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, any further discussion?

1292
01:39:51,813 --> 01:40:02,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Mr. Clerk, did you get Councilor Knight's, Vice President Knight's B paper?

1293
01:40:03,782 --> 01:40:14,230
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a request that the Medford Housing Authority and the Consumer Advisory Committee report back to the council on the steps taken to prevent evictions.

1294
01:40:14,250 --> 01:40:15,891
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that correct?

1295
01:40:16,569 --> 01:40:27,016
[SPEAKER_03]: The housing security concerns in the programming that we're funding through the Community Preservation Act and whether or not they'd be willing to expand their role based on the conversations I've had with Director Driscoll.

1296
01:40:27,076 --> 01:40:33,301
[SPEAKER_03]: I have said that, but we'd like to get it back in formal fashion, if that's not too much to ask.

1297
01:40:33,901 --> 01:40:34,061
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1298
01:40:34,081 --> 01:40:35,762
[SPEAKER_04]: You got that, Mr. Clerk?

1299
01:40:36,243 --> 01:40:36,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Got it, yep.

1300
01:40:37,403 --> 01:40:38,464
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, on to B paper.

1301

1397
01:43:54,754 --> 01:43:57,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a couple of weeks ago, we put on a resolution for Brian Branson.

1398

[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Mox was the lead sponsor of that resolution.

1399
01:44:01,058 --> 01:44:04,139
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was going through my packet this evening.

1400
01:44:04,179 --> 01:44:14,185
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, as part of that resolution, we amended the paper and requested that we send it to Mr. Maloney in the athletic department to discuss doing something and Brian's on it to reflect and recognize all the work that he's done.

1401
01:44:14,585 --> 01:44:16,006
[SPEAKER_03]: on behalf of the youth in our community.

1402
01:44:16,426 --> 01:44:18,107
[SPEAKER_03]: And in our paper in our packet.

1403
01:44:18,847 --> 01:44:28,933
[SPEAKER_03]: This week, Mr. President, we have a paper before us, relative to Council Resolution 20682 offered by Councilor Mox, and I think it's really great so I just wanted to share this with the council.

1404
01:44:31,290 --> 01:44:33,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Max's resolution to recognize Brian Branson.

1405

[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

1406
01:44:35,035 --> 01:44:41,963
[SPEAKER_03]: Hank Morse and I have had a great opportunity of being Brian's teammates on both the Medford Babe Ruth Red Sox in Medford High School 1984 baseball team.

1407
01:44:42,984 --> 01:44:46,629
[SPEAKER_03]: I will be creating the annual Brian Branson Memorial Award.

1408
01:44:46,969 --> 01:44:50,431
