    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=178.12s">Yes,</a>  affirmative motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=182.743s">21038</a>  offered by Vice President Knight and Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=188.606s">Resolution</a>  urging fair and full employment opportunity at Amazon. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=194.147s">Whereas</a>  Amazon has targeted the city of Medford expansion of its e-commerce network, and whereas COVID-19 has had a devastating impact on the health, safety, and well-being of the residents of the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=208.019s">And</a>  whereas the preventative measures put in place to combat COVID-19 by state and local guidelines to prevent the spread and contain the transmission of the coronavirus have had a devastating <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=221.68s">economic</a>  impact on local retail establishments in the city of Medfordians have changed the retail options for the residents of the city of Medfordians, whereas preventative measures put in place to combat COVID-19, and whereas <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=239.449s">existing</a>  retail and e-commerce delivery networks currently operate in the city of Medford and set community standards for every family with sustaining wages, benefits, including but not limited to quality health insurance and secure retirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=256.873s">And</a>  whereas these retail and e-commerce delivery options coexist in Medford's diverse neighborhoods while adding value to the fabric of the community offering <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=269.416s">good</a>  careers for Medford residents to provide for their families. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=272.337s">And</a>  whereas existing e-commerce delivery options have aptly served the residents of the city of Medford throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, while maintaining the highest standards for its essential workforce. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=284.582s">And</a>  whereas Amazon, which is not conformed to area standards for wages, benefits, and working condition, has targeted the city of Medford area for expansion of its e-commerce operations. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=296.306s">Now,</a>  be it resolved, <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=298.62s">that</a>  the Medford City Council, hereby assembled, urges Amazon to meet and confer with the Medford community, included but not limited to representatives from the International Brotherhood of Teamsters Local 25, locally impacted neighborhood groups, local residents, and other interested parties to discuss how Amazon can expand the delivery options, warehouses, and fulfillment centers in a way that is beneficial to the city of Medford and its residents while guaranteeing <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=328.335s">sustainable</a>  growth for the city in helping to ensure that fair and equitable employment standards are maintained for all e-commerce delivery networks throughout the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=338.161s">And</a>  it be further resolved that prior to any expansion into the city of Medford, Amazon commits to and presents sufficient evidence to the Medford City Council that its operation meets or exceeds current standards set by existing e-commerce delivery networks. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=358.043s">This</a>  commitment would include that all delivery drivers be direct employees of Amazon and not independent contractors. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=365.327s">Amazon</a>  will ensure that all employee delivery drivers pass the most rigorous background checks, including COVID checks and are compliant with all federal DOT drug testing guidelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=376.994s">Amazon</a>  will only hire competent and safe delivery drivers that will maintain the utmost <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=385.861s">professional</a>  conduct in their day-to-day operation in the neighborhoods of the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=392.004s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=393.584s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=394.885s">I</a>  appreciate you bearing with me and going through all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=398.626s">I</a>  apologize for the length of my resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=402.608s">However,</a>  I think it's a very important issue, and I think it's very important that we take a look at this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=408.511s">It's</a>  evident that during government shutdown, Mr. President, we've all become more and more reliant upon e-commerce options. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=415.671s">But</a>  while e-commerce certainly has its many benefits, the adverse impacts that it's had during the pandemic upon Main Street USA is something many of the businesses here in Medford are never going to recover from. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=429.565s">And</a>  the expansion of Amazon in particular is negatively impacting the well-being of our community and our local economy. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=437.816s">Mr.</a>  President, there were just a number of reported concerns that Amazon's lowering the bar concerning safety standards, misclassifying of employees, failing to pay a living wage, provide health insurance, or secure retirement prospects for their employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=452.928s">And</a>  quite frankly, our community's lost jobs to this mega corporation. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=456.931s">And</a>  as one of the most profitable corporations in the world, Amazon has a social responsibility to its consumers. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=464.157s">the</a>  environment of the communities that they service, and most importantly, its workers, to replace jobs lost in our community during this pandemic with opportunities that meet our current community standards and raise the bar, not lower it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=476.642s">And</a>  that's not what we're receiving right now, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=479.183s">The</a>  Medford City Council's called upon Amazon to appear before us in the past to address the concerns that we have regarding their operational practices, the way their drivers park and drive down the street, the way their drivers aren't properly quarry checked, the size of the vehicles that they're <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=493.228s">distributing</a>  across our neighborhoods, Mr. President, much to the chagrin of many of the residents and the quality of life of us here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=501.133s">So</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, I ask that my council colleagues support this resolution in calling Amazon to the carpet to address a number of concerns that we have here in the community and raising standards for living people and for working people here in the community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=514.34s">So</a>  I'd ask my council colleagues to support the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=516.962s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=518.566s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=519.667s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=520.848s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=521.768s">I</a>  thank my fellow colleague and Vice President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=527.032s">I</a>  think, not to be redundant, but you hit that right on the button. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=533.076s">I</a>  think that this is something that we brought forward, something that we look to address in my number one <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=542.548s">vision</a>  with this is the safety and having the responsibility that we put on other entities that use Medford as a place of business. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=558.917s">And</a>  I think that it's a very important <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=563.179s">piece</a>  of this puzzle. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=564.38s">And</a>  as they grow and move forward, I think it's important that we meet with them and make sure they understand where we want them to be and how the city of Medford holds them accountable. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=577.975s">And</a>  I think that you're seeing this across the Commonwealth, there are other communities that are focusing on <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=585.383s">you</a>  know, the feet to the fire, per se, to Amazon. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=590.708s">And</a>  as they're growing, it's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=592.53s">You'd</a>  like to see companies grow. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=594.472s">But</a>  as they come into our community, we want to make sure what cost and making sure that they are licensed correctly, that they are quarried. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=605.062s">And</a>  as they drive our streets and <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=609.446s">enter</a>  our residents that they're people that are safe and follow our laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=617.773s">So</a>  I appreciate Councilor Knight's thoroughness with this presentation and move approval.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=628.501s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=629.562s">Councilor</a>  Morell.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=630.923s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=632.244s">Yeah,</a>  I thank Councilors Knight and Scarpelli for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=635.297s">I</a>  couldn't agree more that Amazon is really driving a race to the bottom as far as wages and benefits, while also really damaging local businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=643.022s">And</a>  this also says nothing of their incentivization and really practice of penalties that causes drivers in the area to drive erratically, to stop in the middle of the street, to park against traffic, and really disturb safety in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=657.551s">So</a>  I thank them for bringing this forward, and I look forward to supporting this paper tonight.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=663.235s">Thank</a>  you, Council Member. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=665.196s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=666.517s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Knight for bringing this forward, and I agree with my fellow Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=671.24s">It's</a>  imperative that Amazon is providing good union jobs in our community, especially when they're disrupting so many of our small businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=679.626s">And</a>  you know, really, as Councilor Morell said, and Councilor Knight lowering the bar. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=685.25s">So</a>  I'm strongly supportive of this, and I do think just a special point needs to be made that their labor practices are really devious, and they're <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=695.214s">tracking</a>  people down to the second, and these workers deserve better. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=699.398s">They</a>  deserve a union and they deserve a living wage. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=701.34s">So</a>  I hope that we can help move this forward as a council. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=704.343s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=705.584s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Bears.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=707.589s">Any</a>  further questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=709.51s">One</a>  more thing, Mr. President, I think it's very important to point out that, you know, when we talk about community standards and what we expect here in Medford for employers to do and what it takes to be a good employer, or what it takes to support the rights of workers in the community, we have to also look at the fact that this resolution does speak to asking that Local 25 be involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=730.446s">And</a>  when you look at local 25 the teamsters union and the work they've done related to individuals in the trucking industry and professionals in the trucking industry. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=738.89s">When</a>  we talk about community standards, local 25 help set that bar, Mr. President, when it comes down to a fair living wage when it comes down to. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=746.713s">providing</a>  health benefits and providing secure retirement prospects for the community, we have to look at the organizations that are in this community that provide people with jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=755.522s">And</a>  Local 25 is a large employer in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=758.405s">We</a>  look at the work that Sean O'Brien does as president of Local 25, a Medford resident, a Medford high school grad, someone that maintains pride in his community, someone that has the blue and white running through his veins. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=768.295s">You</a>  know, <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=769.375s">We</a>  have to respect the work that these individuals have done for Medford in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=773.298s">And</a>  that's why I asked Local 25 to be involved in this process as we go forward, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=778.0s">I</a>  thank President O'Brien for his leadership in the region. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=782.963s">And</a>  when I say the region, I don't mean eastern Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=788.089s">Eastern</a>  United States of America, because he's really helping set the tone and set the bar and raise standards across the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=794.932s">So</a>  I want to take an opportunity to also thank Sean O'Brien and the work that he's doing on behalf of the residents in Medford and also across America. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=801.735s">Thank</a>  you very much to Sean.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=803.696s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=804.296s">And</a>  if I if I could say something. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=806.22s">I</a>  want to thank Councilor Knight, Vice President Knight, and Councilor Scott Blake for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=811.384s">These</a>  men and women who work for Amazon, I know they classify them as independent contractors. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=816.849s">They're</a>  not. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=817.549s">Because</a>  independent contractors can set their own time. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=820.972s">Amazon</a>  is a very demanding company, and they set the standard of how these men and women have to work, their hours, and their pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=831.32s">So</a>  they're not independent contractors. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=833.542s">All</a>  Amazon is doing <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=834.81s">is</a>  avoiding paying them workman's comp, and insurance, and a decent living wage, and some type of pension. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=841.734s">So</a>  again, I also support this, not only for what they do in Medford, but for all the men and women who work for this company throughout the country, not just in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=853.482s">The</a>  same thing goes for the Uber and the Lyft guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=856.364s">Those</a>  guys, they're not independent contractors when you're dictated to how you have to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=862.563s">So</a>  again, I thank my councilors for bringing this up and I will be in support of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=867.186s">Mr.</a>  President.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=869.348s">Councilor</a>  Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=870.589s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=871.509s">I</a>  wanna thank my council colleagues as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=873.49s">Councilor</a>  Knight, Councilor Scarpelli for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=876.813s">I</a>  think Councilor Knight, you hit it on the head in one of the last sentences you made. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=880.555s">It's</a>  all about raising the bar and I think that this does that and I'll support this 100% and I move approval.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=888.841s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=890.442s">Any</a>  further discussion on this? <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=893.952s">President.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=895.653s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=897.254s">Just</a>  if we could, what are the next steps regarding this?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=903.378s">We've</a>  asked them to appear before us to discuss the issues that have been brought up by the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=909.763s">So</a>  I'm sure that the clerk will send this out via registered mail so we know that someone has received it. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=917.76s">and</a>  have them appear before us.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=919.962s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=920.642s">So</a>  if they fail to appear in the past, one would think they're probably not gonna appear again. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=925.725s">So</a>  what are the next steps by the city council? <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=930.527s">I</a>  support this, but I wanna support something that has some tea to it and something that we can act upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=936.87s">And</a>  I'm not quite sure that we're there with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=941.012s">I</a>  know the intent, and I support the intent, but I'd like to see some other steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=947.014s">Waiting</a>  for them to come to a meeting, which may never happen, to me is not a next step. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=952.376s">But</a>  like I said, I am supportive.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=954.717s">If</a>  I may, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=956.425s">Vice</a>  President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=957.746s">This</a>  is just one piece in a regional approach that Local 25 is taking and working with the community stakeholders to raise the bar across the region where Amazon is looking to expand. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=967.714s">So</a>  the next steps would be that, you know, we're going to get community support from communities surrounding Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=972.237s">Somerville</a>  had a resolution on very recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=975.079s">The</a>  city of Boston has as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=976.901s">The</a>  next step, and what my intention would be, would be to coordinate with representatives, the sponsors of those pieces of legislation, as well as the legislative arm of Local 25 <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=985.627s">to</a>  begin putting pressure on a dialogue with him. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=988.589s">So</a>  that's the next steps that I'd like to take, Mr. President, and the next steps that have been coordinated through the political arm of Local 25.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=995.414s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=996.595s">So,</a>  Mr. President, are we aware of any particular pieces of legislation that we can look at? <a href="https://youtu.be/bJDrOFPloZA&t=1001.418s">That</a>  would be helpful.</p>
