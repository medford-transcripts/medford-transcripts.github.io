    <p>[Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=3924.465s">Dr.</a>  Marice Edouard-Vincent.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=3958.749s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=3961.791s">So</a>  I will preface that I do have some lengthy remarks this morning, this afternoon, or this evening I should say, but a lot of good news to share a lot of wonderful things happening this month. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=3973.657s">And</a>  so I'm going to get started. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=3977.64s">March</a>  is National Disability Awareness Month, and tomorrow is World Down Syndrome Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=3986.126s">National</a>  Disability Awareness Month began in 1987, when President Ronald Reagan proclaimed it to raise awareness about the importance of inclusion of people with developmental disabilities in all facets of community life. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4001.656s">It</a>  also brings to our attention the barriers that people with disabilities can sometimes face when connecting to the communities in which they live. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4010.964s">In</a>  Medford, we are proud that we are an inclusive community for all, but we are constantly learning about how we can do better. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4021.627s">And</a>  again, as tomorrow being World Down Syndrome Day, it's a global awareness day officially observed by the United Nations since 2012. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4033.235s">This</a>  year's theme is With Us, Not For Us, which means people with disabilities have the right to be treated fairly and have the same opportunities as everyone else, working with others to improve their lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4050.346s">As</a>  you are aware, those with Down syndrome have an extra chromosome. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4055.631s">So</a>  often people will wear crazy socks on March 21st. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4062.497s">I'm</a>  told that chromosomes are shaped like socks. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4067.422s">So</a>  get your craziest socks ready to wear for tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4073.112s">On</a>  behalf of the Medford Public Schools, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate one of our state representatives, Christine Barber, for receiving the Legislator of the Year award from the Massachusetts Developmental Disabilities Council and the Arc of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4092.96s">For</a>  her work with people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4098.075s">Representative</a>  Barber serves as a member of the Massachusetts Autism Commission and works directly with advocates to address challenges facing the disability community. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4109.947s">So</a>  congratulations State Rep Christine Barber. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4114.532s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4118.556s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4119.864s">Today,</a>  the Medford Vocational Technical High School students in the Early Childhood Education Program begin a story, song, and art activity event with the Medford Family Network. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4133.455s">This</a>  program started today and will continue on March 22nd, March 27th, <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4140.66s">and</a>  March 29th. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4142.701s">The</a>  early education students will lead the children in sing-alongs, art, and STEAM activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4149.925s">They</a>  will also read them stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4152.306s">Truly,</a>  this is a win-win partnership for both our students and our young student group community. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4160.95s">This</a>  coming Wednesday, March 22nd is Crossing Guard Appreciation Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4166.712s">We</a>  can't thank our crossing guards enough for keeping our students safe and helping them get to and from school. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4173.995s">Remember</a>  to thank them, especially on Wednesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4178.593s">Also</a>  on March 22nd, we'll be hosting a Zoom informational meeting for parents of incoming middle school students. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4187.736s">These</a>  are our fifth graders rising up to sixth grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4191.597s">We</a>  will discuss the lottery and middle school curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4195.438s">Please</a>  join us from 5 to 6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4198.719s">The</a>  lottery will be live on Zoom on Wednesday, April 12th. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4205.661s">Also</a>  on March 22nd, our CTE programs, our career technical education programs, will be hosting a showcase at Medford Vocational Technical High School from 6 to 8 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4218.171s">All</a>  8th graders and their families are welcome to attend this Wednesday, March 22nd. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4227.876s">March</a>  is also National Women's History Month, and both Medford High School and the Vocational School have planned informational events for all of our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4239.761s">The</a>  Vocational School kicked off Women's History Month on March 2nd, when they presented six guest speakers from the construction and technology industries. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4250.666s">This</a>  panel focused on women and individuals who are non-traditional employees in their field. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4257.911s">Students</a>  in grades nine through 12 from the construction cluster, electrical, carpentry, construction craft labors, and metal fabrication, and the technology cluster, which includes engineering, robotics, and programming, and web development participated in this event. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4280.826s">Panelists</a>  shared stories about how their personal career paths led them to their current position. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4287.99s">As</a>  one of the panelists stated, you have to get comfortable being the only you in the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4295.574s">So</a>  get comfortable with being uncomfortable in educating others that you belong there. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4302.277s">We</a>  thank the following panelists for taking the time to address our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4308.401s">Whitney</a>  Crooks, who is the manager system test development at iRobot Design Assurance Engineering. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4317.286s">Mackenzie</a>  Grammer, an electrician for IBEW Local 103. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4324.463s">Stavrula</a>  Orfanas, a building inspector for the city of Salem. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4330.588s">Kasai</a>  Sensel, technical

href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4345.882s">And</a>  Shalini Vates, project manager, FBN Construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4351.967s">I</a>  thank all of those panelists who came out to support us during that National Women's History Month event, and we will continue to have more events. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4361.372s">Continuing</a>  with that theme, on March 31st, the Medford High School will present its second annual women's panel. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4373.717s">Those</a>  participating will include Chief Justice Kimberly

Superintendent, we look forward to another exciting event for our students on March 31st. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4437.805s">I</a>  would also like to take this time to recognize some of our outstanding athletes. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4444.11s">The</a>  winter athletic season has come to a close, and a number of Mustangs have been named GBL All-Stars and

placed 20th in the boys 400 meters, emerging in the elite division. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4576.142s">By</a>  qualifying for indoor nationals, he also qualified for the outdoor nationals in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4583.948s">Athletes</a>  that qualify for this competition often go on to be college stars and some represent their country at the Olympics. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4593.835s">Congratulations</a>  to Roe and all of our winter sports student-athletes. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4598.841s">You</a>  make us so proud. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4600.043s">Today,</a>  spring sports begin their tryouts, so good luck to all of those trying out this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4609.329s">Also,</a>  last week, I want to recognize our Director of Counseling and Behavioral Health, Stacey Shulman. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4616.491s">She</a>  served as a panelist for our District Attorney, Marion Ryan's presentation, Dealing with Gun Violence in Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4626.114s">Over</a>  130 people from law enforcement, education, and nonprofit fields attended from Middlesex County. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4635.416s">Stacey</a>  spoke of the Medford Public Schools commitment to the Sandy Hook promise, which began with our partnership in 2019. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4643.362s">As</a>  Stacey mentioned at our last meeting, prevention strategies such as start with hello and say something have been shown to significantly improve perceptions of school safety, foster socialization, reduce bullying, and begin to change culture from within. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4664.798s">Stacey</a>  has been fully committed to providing the very best for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4669.399s">Her</a>  presentation provided great information for all in attendance. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4675.86s">I</a>  would like to also say that the Mustang Physical Education Department has received a Project HERE grant from the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4688.482s">The</a>  grant will be used to teach physical education teachers <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4692.643s">the</a>  sport of archery in June. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4695.885s">It</a>  will be added to our curriculum for the 23-24 school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4701.629s">Additionally,</a>  the physical education department is pleased to announce that it will be adding a unified physical education class to the high school electives for the 23-24 school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4715.678s">So</a>  I'm very pleased with that new addition for next school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4720.345s">I'd</a>  like to let the community know that on Monday, March 27, the McGlynn Middle School will once again host screenagers, the next chapter, in the school auditorium from 6.15 to 7.30 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4736.69s">So</a>  there will be a second showing of screenagers for families that were not able to attend the first showing. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4744.492s">Next</a>  Thursday, March 30th, is our final Building Bridges to Kindergarten presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4751.537s">It</a>  will be presented at the high school library from 6.30 to 7.30 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4757.161s">All</a>  are welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4758.522s">Again,</a>  this is for incoming kindergarten students that will be joining Medford Public Schools in the fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4766.847s">Also,</a>  our Parent Information Center will remain open until 6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4771.996s">for</a>  any parents or caregivers to support them with their student registration needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4779.201s">I</a>  want to recognize our spotlight productions that just took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4785.263s">Wonderful,</a>  wonderful production of Annie Jr. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4789.365s">I</a>  heard the students singing and practicing and they sounded absolutely fabulous. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4794.767s">All</a>  the shows were wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4796.347s">It</a>  ended this past weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4798.989s">I</a>  want the community to know that another presentation production is coming next weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4804.952s">That</a>  production is going to be Beauty and the Beast, and it will begin on Thursday, March 30, Friday the 31st, and on Saturday, April 1, there will be two shows, a 2 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4817.561s">and</a>  a 7 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4819.802s">I</a>  will also put that in my weekly update. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4822.324s">Tickets</a>  went on sale today via Eventbrite, and I want you to know that many of our high school students are part of the cast, so it definitely will be a wonderful opportunity to support Spotlight Productions. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4837.953s">I</a>  also want to recognize our Brooks 4th and 5th grade CCSR students that are leading a community headstone cleaning event for the graves of Medford's Korean war veterans at Oak Grove Cemetery on Patriots Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4855.789s">That</a>  will be taking place on April 17th at 1230 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4860.591s">They</a>  are hoping that many in our community will come out to join and support them. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4865.573s">It</a>  should take about 45 minutes to clean a marker. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4870.255s">The</a>  more hands that are available, the better. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4872.296s">And</a>  I will continue to advertise that, but I just wanted people to know, save the date if you would like to support a community event. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4882.12s">Mr.</a>  Coats at the Brooks School. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4884.502s">His</a>  email is mcoats, m-c-o-a-t-e-s, at medford.k12.ma.us. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4894.17s">Please</a>  email him by April 6th if you would like to participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4901.012s">I</a>  would also be remiss if I did not mention that this coming Wednesday at sundown is the beginning of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4910.936s">During</a>  this month, Muslim members of the community fast from pre-sunrise to sunset in the hopes of achieving greater consciousness of God, wishing our Muslim families a peaceful Ramadan. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4925.823s">So</a>  in closing, <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4928.254s">Spring</a>  officially began today on this beautiful day at 5.24 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4933.999s">And</a>  tomorrow is World Poetry Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4937.102s">So</a>  I would like to close with this very short poem from an English poet, Robert Browning's poem about spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4946.69s">The</a>  years at the spring and days at the moon. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4951.694s">Mornings</a>  at seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4954.298s">The</a>  hillsides do cold. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4957.759s">The</a>  locks on the wing. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4960.199s">The</a>  snails on the thorn. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4963.1s">God's</a>  in his heaven. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=4966.041s">All's</a>  right with the world. <a

We have report and acknowledgement of achievement of Medford high school students at the region for science and engineering fair held at Tufts university.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=5287.51s">On</a>  Friday, March 3rd, um, 2023 11 high school, uh, Medford high school students participated in the region for science and engineering fair at Tufts university. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=5297.58s">Our</a>  students represented our school very well. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=5300.803s">We</a>  had one overall award presented to students as well as several recognition awards for their projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=5307.569s">Owen</a>  Liao, Dan Khoi Nguyen, and Vina Lee placed 13th overall at the fair and received the Tufts University Science Fair Prize of $250. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=5315.456s">The</a>  other students received recognition awards from Starbucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=5321.639s">And</a>  in order to participate, students need to submit a research proposal for approval, as well as carry out research and register for the fair once the project is approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=5331.568s">Participation</a>  represents a multi-step process that's done voluntarily by these students outside the time of the curriculum at MHS. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=5341.357s">Students</a>  are both encouraged and supported by their classroom science teachers to move forward with the projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=5346.618s">and</a>  participate in the event. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=5348.401s">But</a>  I want to especially mention Dr. Warnes, the physics teacher at Medford High, who encouraged the participation of many of these students. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=5358.454s">I</a>  also should mention that they haven't had an in-person <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=5361.6s">science</a>  fair events since 2019 at the regional level or the state level. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=5365.524s">So</a>  this was the first one that these students could have ever participated in. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=5370.188s">I'm</a>  really proud that the students took on this particular challenge and registered early, did their projects early. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=5378.856s">As</a>  you can see, we've decoupled our fair from the regional fair to be a much more inclusive fair at our level, allow many more students to participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=5387.504s">and</a>  if students want to participate in the regional fair, they have this sort of accelerated path to be able to participate in that fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=5395.528s">So</a>  many of them are here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=5397.929s">Some</a>  had other obligations, so they couldn't make it, but I'm really excited to be able to have them receive certificates of recognition from the school committee this evening for their achievements.</p>

    <p>[bIcF9zSptpQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=5704.831s">We</a>  did the project last year, but we wanted to improve and so this time we did it with a robot to see if we can like standardize randomness and like use it to our advantage. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=5716.762s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=5724.086s">Well,</a>  for like the application of our project, for real world applications, we were thinking about on a lot like a really smaller scale, physicists can use this similar type of experiment to measure the size of small particles. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=5741.141s">We</a>  just did that on a larger scale so that it's observable and easier to experiment with.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=5752.512s">Wonderful,</a>  congratulations to all. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=5754.175s">We're</a>  very proud of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=5755.298s">And</a>  I think everybody wants to take a picture with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=5758.063s">Amazing</a>  students. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=5759.506s">So</a>  come on up. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=5761.23s">We're</a>  just gonna go right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=5851.761s">Next</a>  up, we have a presentation about Medford Public Schools Unified Arts. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=5856.365s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=5856.565s">Haley</a>  Rello, Coordinator of Performing Arts, and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=5860.309s">Suzanne</a>  Fee, Coordinator of Fine Arts. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=5862.691s">Welcome.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=5868.732s">Good</a>  evening, everyone, Madam Mayor, Superintendent Edivar-Vincent, and school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=5872.835s">We</a>  are thrilled to be up here to keep this happy, positive ball rolling this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=5876.658s">So</a>  we'll be presenting on our Visual and Performing Arts program. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=5880.521s">So</a>  first, we have Fine Arts.</p>

    <p>[Fee]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=5882.782s">I'm</a>  Suzanne Fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=5883.723s">I'm</a>  the coordinator of fine arts. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=5885.324s">I</a>  stepped into the role in July. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=5886.926s">And</a>  prior to that, I was the art teacher at the McGlynn Middle School for many, many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=5892.231s">And</a>  I'm excited to be in this new role. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=5895.454s">And</a>  one of the best parts about the role is sharing what our children are doing and making with the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=5903.641s">So</a>  with that, I'd like to give you a little update about things we've done this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=5908.746s">I</a>  think it's safe to say we hit the ground running when we stepped into our roles in July. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=5913.49s">Just</a>  as a review, our staff, all our elementary schools have a full-time art teacher, each middle school has a full-time art teacher, and the high school has two full-time art teachers, but we also have two teachers outside of the department teaching some two credit art courses, and I teach two courses at the high school level as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=5934.607s">So</a>  just to review some new and notable things that we've done this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=5940.318s">The</a>  National Art Honor Society, we established a chapter for the first time at the high school level, and we have 22 members this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=5950.24s">One</a>  of the great things about a National Art Honor Society is that one of the requirements is that you have to do 15 hours of art-based community service. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=5960.602s">So</a>  we have some students going into Kids' Corner and doing craft activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=5965.583s">We</a>  have kids donating artwork to waiting rooms and offices. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=5971.104s">We</a>  have some kids doing something called the Art Abandonment Project, where you leave a small piece of art for someone to take home and enjoy. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=5978.326s">And</a>  we have a lot of other projects going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=5981.867s">So</a>  that's been a great addition to the school community. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=5985.128s">It's</a>  also a really nice way for kids who <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=5988.869s">aren't</a>  able to take an art course every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=5991.052s">If</a>  you have taken an art course in the past, or you plan to in the future, you can still be in the National Art Honor Society, as long as you're the proper grade level is maintained. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6000.763s">So</a>  it's a nice way to keep students in the arts. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6004.441s">This</a>  past month, I received grant funding to acquire supplies for students to create murals at various schools in the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6012.791s">And</a>  also, the funds will be used to do some other student-directed visual improvements at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6020.768s">And</a>  so that National Art Honor Society students are using some of those funds to do mural projects for teachers in their classroom and around the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6029.976s">So</a>  it's been nice to have that cache of supplies that we can use. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6036.229s">The</a>  online art gallery just got uploaded to the district website, and there's a separate gallery for each school in the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6047.071s">And</a>  so each school's page has an art gallery, and then the fine arts page has the gallery of every school, and that will be getting updated and get new content as the year goes on. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6058.754s">And</a>  we're really excited about being able to share the artwork with the community that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6065.157s">And</a>  we had two, Mrs. Miller in web design at the vocational school and two of her senior students, Kevin Guzmo and Vibhav Saini were really instrumental in working with me to design the page and teach me how to upload the artwork and stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6083.781s">So</a>  it wouldn't have been possible without them. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6086.401s">And</a>  it was really nice to have that student involvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6091.409s">One</a>  of the first initiatives that I dove into the past summer was getting approved to be a site location for Lesley University art therapy students to conduct internships with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6108.732s">Our</a>  main focus was to try to get a second year art therapy intern at the Curtis Tufts to work with our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6117.718s">It</a>  didn't work out for this school year, we kind of applied too late, but we have a wonderful candidate lined up to join us at the Curtis Tufts from September to May and she's going to do some <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6130.485s">art</a>  therapy and small group, individual and whole group. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6133.987s">And</a>  I think it's a great addition to that school. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6138.188s">So</a>  I'm really excited about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6140.909s">We've</a>  had various guest speakers this year at each level. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6146.392s">At</a>  the elementary level, we had author and illustrator Barney Salzberg do a virtual Zoom with <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6157.196s">all</a>  elementary schools, and that was thanks to Jen Belandra, the art teacher at the McGlynn Elementary. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6164.382s">He</a>  did an interactive Zoom, and he was able to look at some kids' artwork, and he talked about his process, and it was all based on his book, Beautiful Oops, which talks about how you could make art from mistakes and <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6180.755s">It</a>  was a great experience for all our elementary students to enjoy. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6184.617s">At</a>  the middle school level, we had a professor of animation from MassArt. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6189.679s">He's</a>  also a Medford Public Schools parent, Jesse Strauss, come in and talk to students about the process of animating and how to develop your story. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6202.884s">And</a>  then at the high school level, UMass Lowell professor of graphic design and illustration came to talk to some art students, as well as the students in the graphic design program about some options at UMass Lowell. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6217.723s">And</a>  she also joined the graphic design advisory committee this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6224.025s">We're</a>  working with Susan Altman on the community mural mosaic project, which is going to be hung outside of Medford High. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6232.527s">And</a>  we have had students from virtually every school in the district collaborating and working on the project with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6240.389s">And</a>  we still have a ways to go, but it should be slated to be finished by the end of the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6247.074s">and</a>  I'm gonna share a mock-up of the design that was designed by three different students at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6257.256s">And</a>  so we hope to have that finished by the end of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6263.017s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6263.257s">Arello</a>  and I also started our bi-monthly fine and performing arts newsletter called Color and Chords. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6269.558s">The</a>  next issue will be coming soon, but you can find our back issues on the district website. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6276.158s">We</a>  had a library display at Medford High that was really successful, and it was really a nice opportunity for students to see their work hung and framed professionally, and we'll be displaying there next year as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6290.806s">We</a>  just started a photography club at Medford High, and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6294.989s">Van</a>  Aken is going to be doing a photography contest and show later in the spring, and we have some professional photographers lined up to jury that show. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6305.723s">Book</a>  Wonder and Medford Arts Council, thanks to them, there'll be an inclusive, diverse art library in Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6311.508s">Mazeka's</a>  classroom at the Missituk. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6314.67s">The</a>  Roberts and the McGlynn Elementary have art shows coming up in the next few weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6318.353s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6318.553s">Shanley,</a>  Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6319.193s">Belanger</a>  and their PTOs have worked to receive grant funding to help defray some of the cost of mounting and displaying and hanging the artwork. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6327.279s">Those</a>  are gonna be great shows. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6328.64s">I</a>  think they're both in early May. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6334.056s">The</a>  Fine Arts Hall of Fame has been in existence at the McGlynn Middle School for the past five years, and we're gonna expand that to the Andrews Middle School this year, and hopefully to other schools in the following year. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6347.008s">Lastly,</a>  eight of our students have won Scholastic Art Awards this year, which I think is the most we've ever received in a single year, and we have a student who has been nominated for a National Award, so that's really exciting. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6359.554s">And</a>  just really quickly looking forward to 2023 and 2024 school year, we're excited to be working with Mr. Fallon, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6369.236s">Fitzpatrick</a>  and Mr. DeLeva to combine the arts into the CTE rotation for freshmen. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6377.178s">It's</a>  a pilot program and we're excited to build the connection between the vocational school and our arts programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6384.898s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6385.098s">Rallo</a>  and I would like to plan some sort of arts week or arts month next school year that would be dedicated to showcasing student artwork in various locations throughout the district in tandem with some music and performance events as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6400.733s">So</a>  we'd like to try to coordinate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6404.244s">We</a>  have a new photography course being offered at the high school this year for the first time in a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6409.867s">And</a>  I'm thrilled about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6412.288s">It's</a>  kind of been a void in our program. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6414.829s">Virtually</a>  every school in the surrounding communities and similar districts do offer some photography courses. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6420.392s">So</a>  we're starting with a digital photography course, and then hopefully in years to come, we can expand that to film photography. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6428.496s">And</a>  we also have a new art history course. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6431.258s">It's</a>  an art history and drawing course that's going to be offered as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6436.041s">And</a>  lastly, just looking towards next year, I wanna try to increase community collaboration, pulling in some more of our, the city is full of professionals and artists who I'm sure are willing to share their expertise and real world knowledge with our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6451.973s">So</a>  I wanna sort of explore that a little bit more. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6455.854s">I'm</a>  working with Arts Collaborative in Medford and hopefully we can develop a partnership so they can provide some meaningful art opportunities for our students outside of school. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6466.682s">And</a>  lastly, I wanna try to build some connections between our artists across grade levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6470.605s">So</a>  maybe our high school art clubs and middle school art clubs can collaborate and do some stuff together. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6476.47s">I</a>  think that would be nice to continue to foster that love of arts for our younger students. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6483.717s">So</a>  that's it, I'm gonna turn it over to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6485.097s">Rallo</a>  about performing arts.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6488.279s">And</a>  before you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6489.099s">Rallo,</a>  before you start, I know we have a student spotlight, I see it in your presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6495.401s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6495.621s">He's</a>  here tonight.</p>

    <p>[Fee]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6497.362s">I</a>  already took his picture for the next day.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6499.282s">Yes,</a>  our student rep. <a href="https://youtu.be/aFwV0Rc2Kx0&t=6502.043s">So</a>  I had to point that out.</p>
