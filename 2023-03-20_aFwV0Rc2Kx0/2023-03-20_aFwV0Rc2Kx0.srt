48
01:05:58,749 --> 01:05:59,289
[SPEAKER_16]: Good evening.

49
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:12,837
[SPEAKER_16]: So I will preface that I do have some lengthy remarks this morning, this afternoon, or this evening I should say, but a lot of good news to share a lot of wonderful things happening this month.

50
01:06:13,657 --> 01:06:16,319
[SPEAKER_16]: And so I'm going to get started.

51
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:24,845
[SPEAKER_16]: March is National Disability Awareness Month, and tomorrow is World Down Syndrome Day.

52
01:06:26,126 --> 01:06:40,715
[SPEAKER_16]: National Disability Awareness Month began in 1987, when President Ronald Reagan proclaimed it to raise awareness about the importance of inclusion of people with developmental disabilities in all facets of community life.

53
01:06:41,656 --> 01:06:50,043
[SPEAKER_16]: It also brings to our attention the barriers that people with disabilities can sometimes face when connecting to the communities in which they live.

54
01:06:50,964 --> 01:06:58,711
[SPEAKER_16]: In Medford, we are proud that we are an inclusive community for all, but we are constantly learning about how we can do better.

55
01:07:01,627 --> 01:07:10,733
[SPEAKER_16]: And again, as tomorrow being World Down Syndrome Day, it's a global awareness day officially observed by the United Nations since 2012.

56
01:07:13,235 --> 01:07:29,265
[SPEAKER_16]: This year's theme is With Us, Not For Us, which means people with disabilities have the right to be treated fairly and have the same opportunities as everyone else, working with others to improve their lives.

57
01:07:30,346 --> 01:07:34,870
[SPEAKER_16]: As you are aware, those with Down syndrome have an extra chromosome.

58
01:07:35,631 --> 01:07:41,517
[SPEAKER_16]: So often people will wear crazy socks on March 21st.

59
01:07:42,497 --> 01:07:46,301
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm told that chromosomes are shaped like socks.

60
01:07:47,422 --> 01:07:50,585
[SPEAKER_16]: So get your craziest socks ready to wear for tomorrow.

61
01:07:53,112 --> 01:08:11,920
[SPEAKER_16]: On behalf of the Medford Public Schools, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate one of our state representatives, Christine Barber, for receiving the Legislator of the Year award from the Massachusetts Developmental Disabilities Council and the Arc of Massachusetts.

62
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:17,002
[SPEAKER_16]: For her work with people with intellectual and developmental disabilities,

63
01:08:18,075 --> 01:08:29,446
[SPEAKER_16]: Representative Barber serves as a member of the Massachusetts Autism Commission and works directly with advocates to address challenges facing the disability community.

64
01:08:29,947 --> 01:08:32,530
[SPEAKER_16]: So congratulations State Rep Christine Barber.

65
01:08:34,532 --> 01:08:34,772
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

66
01:08:38,556 --> 01:08:38,916

[SPEAKER_16]: They will also read them stories.

72
01:09:12,306 --> 01:09:19,370
[SPEAKER_16]: Truly, this is a win-win partnership for both our students and our young student group community.

73
01:09:20,950 --> 01:09:25,892
[SPEAKER_16]: This coming Wednesday, March 22nd is Crossing Guard Appreciation Day.

74
01:09:26,712 --> 01:09:33,295
[SPEAKER_16]: We can't thank our crossing guards enough for keeping our students safe and helping them get to and from school.

75
01:09:33,995 --> 01:09:36,916
[SPEAKER_16]: Remember to thank them, especially on Wednesday.

76

88
01:11:27,990 --> 01:11:34,513

89

144
01:19:18,522 --> 01:19:25,546
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, this is for incoming kindergarten students that will be joining Medford Public Schools in the fall.

145
01:19:26,847 --> 01:19:31,475
[SPEAKER_16]: Also, our Parent Information Center will remain open until 6 p.m.

146
01:19:31,996 --> 01:19:37,345
[SPEAKER_16]: for any parents or caregivers to support them with their student registration needs.

147
01:19:39,201 --> 01:19:43,923
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to recognize our spotlight productions that just took place.

148
01:19:45,263 --> 01:19:48,084
[SPEAKER_16]: Wonderful, wonderful production of Annie Jr.

149
01:19:49,365 --> 01:19:53,526
[SPEAKER_16]: I heard the students singing and practicing and they sounded absolutely fabulous.

150
01:19:54,767 --> 01:19:56,067
[SPEAKER_16]: All the shows were wonderful.

151
01:19:56,347 --> 01:19:57,688
[SPEAKER_16]: It ended this past weekend.

152
01:19:58,989 --> 01:20:04,212
[SPEAKER_16]: I want the community to know that another presentation production is coming next weekend.

153
01:20:04,952 --> 01:20:17,541
[SPEAKER_16]: That production is going to be Beauty and the Beast, and it will begin on Thursday, March 30, Friday the 31st, and on Saturday, April 1, there will be two shows, a 2 p.m.

154
01:20:17,561 --> 01:20:18,061
[SPEAKER_16]: and a 7 p.m.

155
01:20:19,802 --> 01:20:21,923
[SPEAKER_16]: I will also put that in my weekly update.

156
01:20:22,324 --> 01:20:36,472
[SPEAKER_16]: Tickets went on sale today via Eventbrite, and I want you to know that many of our high school students are part of the cast, so it definitely will be a wonderful opportunity to support Spotlight Productions.

157
01:20:37,953 --> 01:20:54,828
[SPEAKER_16]: I also want to recognize our Brooks 4th and 5th grade CCSR students that are leading a community headstone cleaning event for the graves of Medford's Korean war veterans at Oak Grove Cemetery on Patriots Day.

158
01:20:55,789 --> 01:20:59,651
[SPEAKER_16]: That will be taking place on April 17th at 1230 p.m.

159
01:21:00,591 --> 01:21:04,653
[SPEAKER_16]: They are hoping that many in our community will come out to join and support them.

160
01:21:05,573 --> 01:21:09,015
[SPEAKER_16]: It should take about 45 minutes to clean a marker.

161
01:21:10,255 --> 01:21:12,276
[SPEAKER_16]: The more hands that are available, the better.

162
01:21:12,296 --> 01:21:21,440
[SPEAKER_16]: And I will continue to advertise that, but I just wanted people to know, save the date if you would like to support a community event.

163
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:24,282

01:21:34,170 --> 01:21:39,194
[SPEAKER_16]: Please email him by April 6th if you would like to participate.

166
01:21:41,012 --> 01:21:50,236
[SPEAKER_16]: I would also be remiss if I did not mention that this coming Wednesday at sundown is the beginning of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.

167
01:21:50,936 --> 01:22:04,782
[SPEAKER_16]: During this month, Muslim members of the community fast from pre-sunrise to sunset in the hopes of achieving greater consciousness of God, wishing our Muslim families a peaceful Ramadan.

168
01:22:05,823 --> 01:22:06,663
[SPEAKER_16]: So in closing,

169
01:22:08,254 --> 01:22:13,038

170
01:22:13,999 --> 01:22:16,181
[SPEAKER_16]: And tomorrow is World Poetry Day.

171
01:22:17,102 --> 01:22:25,168
[SPEAKER_16]: So I would like to close with this very short poem from an English poet, Robert Browning's poem about spring.

172
01:22:26,690 --> 01:22:30,453
[SPEAKER_16]: The years at the spring and days at the moon.

173
01:22:31,694 --> 01:22:32,975
[SPEAKER_16]: Mornings at seven.

174
01:22:34,298 --> 01:22:36,459

[SPEAKER_16]: The snails on the thorn.

177
01:22:43,100 --> 01:22:44,580
[SPEAKER_16]: God's in his heaven.

178
01:22:46,041 --> 01:22:47,721
[SPEAKER_16]: All's right with the world.

179

216
01:26:08,014 --> 01:26:10,696
[SPEAKER_01]: So we announced it this year that this award is available.

217
01:26:11,147 --> 01:26:19,812
[SPEAKER_01]: Next year, the student is selected from that junior class following the criteria that I'm gonna announce in a moment.

218
01:26:21,352 --> 01:26:25,254
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we present the students with the award.

219
01:26:25,655 --> 01:26:27,396
[SPEAKER_01]: The following criteria will be used.

01:26:41,487 --> 01:26:53,932
[SPEAKER_01]: The student will have been endorsed by their current teacher in the discipline, and the student will also have received endorsements from at least two members of the faculty of the respective discipline by vote at a department meeting.

224
01:26:55,012 --> 01:27:00,995
[SPEAKER_01]: The student can only receive one of the two awards, so it goes to two separate students for the year.

225
01:27:02,885 --> 01:27:08,307
[SPEAKER_01]: Jay Lim was an MIT professor of electrical engineering and computer science.

226
01:27:08,347 --> 01:27:11,948
[SPEAKER_01]: He worked in the area of television systems and signal compression.

233
01:27:35,860 --> 01:27:42,902
[SPEAKER_01]: The JLM Foundation is making this generous donation to our students, and I'd like to recommend that the school committee accept the donation.

234
01:27:43,882 --> 01:27:44,163
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

235
01:27:45,663 --> 01:27:48,584
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to approve by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Graham.

236
01:27:48,844 --> 01:27:49,544
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

237
01:27:50,105 --> 01:27:50,225

[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

241
01:27:54,565 --> 01:27:54,985
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

242
01:27:55,205 --> 01:27:55,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

243
01:27:55,525 --> 01:27:55,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

244
01:27:55,906 --> 01:28:05,549
[SPEAKER_04]: We're onto number C. We have report and acknowledgement of achievement of Medford high school students at the region for science and engineering fair held at Tufts university.

245
01:28:07,510 --> 01:28:16,694
[SPEAKER_01]: On Friday, March 3rd, um, 2023 11 high school, uh, Medford high school students participated in the region for science and engineering fair at Tufts university.

246
01:28:17,580 --> 01:28:19,962
[SPEAKER_01]: Our students represented our school very well.

247
01:28:20,803 --> 01:28:26,889
[SPEAKER_01]: We had one overall award presented to students as well as several recognition awards for their projects.

248
01:28:27,569 --> 01:28:35,396
[SPEAKER_01]: Owen Liao, Dan Khoi Nguyen, and Vina Lee placed 13th overall at the fair and received the Tufts University Science Fair Prize of $250.

249
01:28:35,456 --> 01:28:40,141
[SPEAKER_01]: The other students received recognition awards from Starbucks.

250
01:28:41,639 --> 01:28:50,827
[SPEAKER_01]: And in order to participate, students need to submit a research proposal for approval, as well as carry out research and register for the fair once the project is approved.

251
01:28:51,568 --> 01:29:00,356
[SPEAKER_01]: Participation represents a multi-step process that's done voluntarily by these students outside the time of the curriculum at MHS.

252
01:29:01,357 --> 01:29:06,021
[SPEAKER_01]: Students are both encouraged and supported by their classroom science teachers to move forward with the projects.

253
01:29:06,618 --> 01:29:07,960
[SPEAKER_01]: and participate in the event.

254
01:29:08,401 --> 01:29:15,931
[SPEAKER_01]: But I want to especially mention Dr. Warnes, the physics teacher at Medford High, who encouraged the participation of many of these students.

255
01:29:18,454 --> 01:29:20,758
[SPEAKER_01]: I also should mention that they haven't had an in-person

256
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:25,484
[SPEAKER_01]: science fair events since 2019 at the regional level or the state level.

257
01:29:25,524 --> 01:29:29,407
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was the first one that these students could have ever participated in.

258
01:29:30,188 --> 01:29:38,076
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really proud that the students took on this particular challenge and registered early, did their projects early.

259
01:29:38,856 --> 01:29:47,084
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can see, we've decoupled our fair from the regional fair to be a much more inclusive fair at our level, allow many more students to participate.

260
01:29:47,504 --> 01:29:53,787
[SPEAKER_01]: and if students want to participate in the regional fair, they have this sort of accelerated path to be able to participate in that fair.

261
01:29:55,528 --> 01:29:57,829
[SPEAKER_01]: So many of them are here tonight.

262
01:29:57,929 --> 01:30:10,195
[SPEAKER_01]: Some had other obligations, so they couldn't make it, but I'm really excited to be able to have them receive certificates of recognition from the school committee this evening for their achievements.

263
01:30:19,404 --> 01:30:22,685
[SPEAKER_16]: When you hear your name being said, first congratulations to all of you.

264
01:30:25,666 --> 01:30:28,347
[SPEAKER_16]: Please come on up and we will shake your hand.

265
01:30:29,988 --> 01:30:31,128

01:31:16,986 --> 01:31:19,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Rakshita Shankar Ganesh.

269
01:31:41,148 --> 01:31:42,670
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully we can hear about a project or two.

270
01:31:45,052 --> 01:31:46,573
[SPEAKER_04]: if there's any public speakers in the room.

[SPEAKER_06]: Congratulations.

276
01:34:08,485 --> 01:34:09,586
[SPEAKER_06]: Mary Schmidt.

277
01:34:18,810 --> 01:34:20,211
[SPEAKER_06]: Charlotte Yanamoto.

278
01:34:27,155 --> 01:34:29,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we get one of you to tell us about your project?

279
01:34:33,358 --> 01:34:34,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Any takers, any takers?

280
01:34:37,793 --> 01:34:38,513
[SPEAKER_16]: Come and share.

281
01:34:38,813 --> 01:34:39,633

[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

284
01:34:52,377 --> 01:34:53,217
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait, okay.

285
01:34:54,117 --> 01:35:01,699
[SPEAKER_00]: So our project, we built a Lego robot to see if you can measure things using probability.

286
01:35:03,660 --> 01:35:04,120
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything else?

287
01:35:04,831 --> 01:35:16,722
[SPEAKER_13]: We did the project last year, but we wanted to improve and so this time we did it with a robot to see if we can like standardize randomness and like use it to our advantage.

288
01:35:16,762 --> 01:35:16,942
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

289
01:35:24,086 --> 01:35:40,780
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, for like the application of our project, for real world applications, we were thinking about on a lot like a really smaller scale, physicists can use this similar type of experiment to measure the size of small particles.

290
01:35:41,141 --> 01:35:46,185
[SPEAKER_11]: We just did that on a larger scale so that it's observable and easier to experiment with.

291
01:35:52,512 --> 01:35:54,135
[SPEAKER_04]: Wonderful, congratulations to all.

292
01:35:54,175 --> 01:35:55,097
[SPEAKER_04]: We're very proud of you.

293
01:35:55,298 --> 01:35:57,723
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think everybody wants to take a picture with you.

294
01:35:58,063 --> 01:35:59,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Amazing students.

295
01:35:59,506 --> 01:36:00,228
[SPEAKER_04]: So come on up.

296
01:36:01,230 --> 01:36:02,192
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just gonna go right here.

297
01:37:31,761 --> 01:37:35,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Next up, we have a presentation about Medford Public Schools Unified Arts.

298
01:37:36,365 --> 01:37:36,545
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

299
01:37:36,565 --> 01:37:40,289
[SPEAKER_04]: Haley Rello, Coordinator of Performing Arts, and Ms.

300
01:37:40,309 --> 01:37:42,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Suzanne Fee, Coordinator of Fine Arts.

301
01:37:42,691 --> 01:37:42,991
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome.

302
01:37:48,732 --> 01:37:52,495
[SPEAKER_17]: Good evening, everyone, Madam Mayor, Superintendent Edivar-Vincent, and school committee.

303
01:37:52,835 --> 01:37:56,178
[SPEAKER_17]: We are thrilled to be up here to keep this happy, positive ball rolling this evening.

304
01:37:56,658 --> 01:38:00,501
[SPEAKER_17]: So we'll be presenting on our Visual and Performing Arts program.

305
01:38:00,521 --> 01:38:01,602
[SPEAKER_17]: So first, we have Fine Arts.

306
01:38:02,782 --> 01:38:03,663
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm Suzanne Fee.

307
01:38:03,723 --> 01:38:05,264
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm the coordinator of fine arts.

308
01:38:05,324 --> 01:38:06,826
[SPEAKER_18]: I stepped into the role in July.

309
01:38:06,926 --> 01:38:12,071
[SPEAKER_18]: And prior to that, I was the art teacher at the McGlynn Middle School for many, many years.

310
01:38:12,231 --> 01:38:15,414
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm excited to be in this new role.

311
01:38:15,454 --> 01:38:23,481
[SPEAKER_18]: And one of the best parts about the role is sharing what our children are doing and making with the community.

312
01:38:23,641 --> 01:38:27,865
[SPEAKER_18]: So with that, I'd like to give you a little update about things we've done this year.

313
01:38:28,746 --> 01:38:32,189
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's safe to say we hit the ground running when we stepped into our roles in July.

314
01:38:33,490 --> 01:38:52,445
[SPEAKER_18]: Just as a review, our staff, all our elementary schools have a full-time art teacher, each middle school has a full-time art teacher, and the high school has two full-time art teachers, but we also have two teachers outside of the department teaching some two credit art courses, and I teach two courses at the high school level as well.

315
01:38:54,607 --> 01:38:58,246
[SPEAKER_18]: So just to review some new and notable things that we've done this year.

316
01:39:00,318 --> 01:39:09,580
[SPEAKER_18]: The National Art Honor Society, we established a chapter for the first time at the high school level, and we have 22 members this year.

317
01:39:10,240 --> 01:39:20,382
[SPEAKER_18]: One of the great things about a National Art Honor Society is that one of the requirements is that you have to do 15 hours of art-based community service.

318
01:39:20,602 --> 01:39:25,063
[SPEAKER_18]: So we have some students going into Kids' Corner and doing craft activities.

319
01:39:25,583 --> 01:39:30,944
[SPEAKER_18]: We have kids donating artwork to waiting rooms and offices.

320
01:39:31,104 --> 01:39:38,206
[SPEAKER_18]: We have some kids doing something called the Art Abandonment Project, where you leave a small piece of art for someone to take home and enjoy.

321
01:39:38,326 --> 01:39:41,807
[SPEAKER_18]: And we have a lot of other projects going on.

322
01:39:41,867 --> 01:39:44,828
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's been a great addition to the school community.

323
01:39:45,128 --> 01:39:47,329
[SPEAKER_18]: It's also a really nice way for kids who

324
01:39:48,869 --> 01:39:50,872
[SPEAKER_18]: aren't able to take an art course every year.

325
01:39:51,052 --> 01:40:00,743
[SPEAKER_18]: If you have taken an art course in the past, or you plan to in the future, you can still be in the National Art Honor Society, as long as you're the proper grade level is maintained.

326
01:40:00,763 --> 01:40:02,786
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's a nice way to keep students in the arts.

327
01:40:04,441 --> 01:40:12,090
[SPEAKER_18]: This past month, I received grant funding to acquire supplies for students to create murals at various schools in the district.

328
01:40:12,791 --> 01:40:19,478
[SPEAKER_18]: And also, the funds will be used to do some other student-directed visual improvements at the high school.

329
01:40:20,768 --> 01:40:29,535
[SPEAKER_18]: And so that National Art Honor Society students are using some of those funds to do mural projects for teachers in their classroom and around the school.

330
01:40:29,976 --> 01:40:34,540
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's been nice to have that cache of supplies that we can use.

331
01:40:36,229 --> 01:40:46,331
[SPEAKER_18]: The online art gallery just got uploaded to the district website, and there's a separate gallery for each school in the district.

332
01:40:47,071 --> 01:40:58,654
[SPEAKER_18]: And so each school's page has an art gallery, and then the fine arts page has the gallery of every school, and that will be getting updated and get new content as the year goes on.

333
01:40:58,754 --> 01:41:03,775
[SPEAKER_18]: And we're really excited about being able to share the artwork with the community that way.

334
01:41:05,157 --> 01:41:23,761
[SPEAKER_18]: And we had two, Mrs. Miller in web design at the vocational school and two of her senior students, Kevin Guzmo and Vibhav Saini were really instrumental in working with me to design the page and teach me how to upload the artwork and stuff.

335
01:41:23,781 --> 01:41:26,381
[SPEAKER_18]: So it wouldn't have been possible without them.

336
01:41:26,401 --> 01:41:28,702
[SPEAKER_18]: And it was really nice to have that student involvement.

337
01:41:31,409 --> 01:41:45,908
[SPEAKER_18]: One of the first initiatives that I dove into the past summer was getting approved to be a site location for Lesley University art therapy students to conduct internships with us.

338
01:41:48,732 --> 01:41:56,937
[SPEAKER_18]: Our main focus was to try to get a second year art therapy intern at the Curtis Tufts to work with our students.

339
01:41:57,718 --> 01:42:09,204
[SPEAKER_18]: It didn't work out for this school year, we kind of applied too late, but we have a wonderful candidate lined up to join us at the Curtis Tufts from September to May and she's going to do some

340
01:42:10,485 --> 01:42:13,907
[SPEAKER_18]: art therapy and small group, individual and whole group.

341
01:42:13,987 --> 01:42:18,168
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think it's a great addition to that school.

342
01:42:18,188 --> 01:42:19,469
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm really excited about that.

343
01:42:20,909 --> 01:42:25,711
[SPEAKER_18]: We've had various guest speakers this year at each level.

344
01:42:26,392 --> 01:42:34,215
[SPEAKER_18]: At the elementary level, we had author and illustrator Barney Salzberg do a virtual Zoom with

345
01:42:37,196 --> 01:42:43,862
[SPEAKER_18]: all elementary schools, and that was thanks to Jen Belandra, the art teacher at the McGlynn Elementary.

346
01:42:44,382 --> 01:42:59,574
[SPEAKER_18]: He did an interactive Zoom, and he was able to look at some kids' artwork, and he talked about his process, and it was all based on his book, Beautiful Oops, which talks about how you could make art from mistakes and

347
01:43:00,755 --> 01:43:04,597
[SPEAKER_18]: It was a great experience for all our elementary students to enjoy.

348
01:43:04,617 --> 01:43:09,639
[SPEAKER_18]: At the middle school level, we had a professor of animation from MassArt.

349
01:43:09,679 --> 01:43:21,624
[SPEAKER_18]: He's also a Medford Public Schools parent, Jesse Strauss, come in and talk to students about the process of animating and how to develop your story.

350
01:43:22,884 --> 01:43:37,343
[SPEAKER_18]: And then at the high school level, UMass Lowell professor of graphic design and illustration came to talk to some art students, as well as the students in the graphic design program about some options at UMass Lowell.

351
01:43:37,723 --> 01:43:41,048
[SPEAKER_18]: And she also joined the graphic design advisory committee this year.

352
01:43:44,025 --> 01:43:52,047
[SPEAKER_18]: We're working with Susan Altman on the community mural mosaic project, which is going to be hung outside of Medford High.

353
01:43:52,527 --> 01:44:00,369
[SPEAKER_18]: And we have had students from virtually every school in the district collaborating and working on the project with us.

354
01:44:00,389 --> 01:44:05,790
[SPEAKER_18]: And we still have a ways to go, but it should be slated to be finished by the end of the school year.

355
01:44:07,074 --> 01:44:15,055
[SPEAKER_18]: and I'm gonna share a mock-up of the design that was designed by three different students at the high school.

356
01:44:17,256 --> 01:44:19,616
[SPEAKER_18]: And so we hope to have that finished by the end of the year.

357
01:44:23,017 --> 01:44:23,237
[SPEAKER_18]: Ms.

358
01:44:23,257 --> 01:44:28,878
[SPEAKER_18]: Arello and I also started our bi-monthly fine and performing arts newsletter called Color and Chords.

359
01:44:29,558 --> 01:44:34,379
[SPEAKER_18]: The next issue will be coming soon, but you can find our back issues on the district website.

360
01:44:36,158 --> 01:44:49,045
[SPEAKER_18]: We had a library display at Medford High that was really successful, and it was really a nice opportunity for students to see their work hung and framed professionally, and we'll be displaying there next year as well.

361
01:44:50,806 --> 01:44:54,889
[SPEAKER_18]: We just started a photography club at Medford High, and Ms.

362
01:44:54,989 --> 01:45:02,033
[SPEAKER_18]: Van Aken is going to be doing a photography contest and show later in the spring, and we have some professional photographers lined up to jury that show.

363
01:45:05,723 --> 01:45:11,488
[SPEAKER_18]: Book Wonder and Medford Arts Council, thanks to them, there'll be an inclusive, diverse art library in Ms.

364
01:45:11,508 --> 01:45:13,069
[SPEAKER_18]: Mazeka's classroom at the Missituk.

365
01:45:14,670 --> 01:45:18,253
[SPEAKER_18]: The Roberts and the McGlynn Elementary have art shows coming up in the next few weeks.

366
01:45:18,353 --> 01:45:18,533
[SPEAKER_18]: Ms.

367
01:45:18,553 --> 01:45:19,173
[SPEAKER_18]: Shanley, Ms.

368
01:45:19,193 --> 01:45:26,839
[SPEAKER_18]: Belanger and their PTOs have worked to receive grant funding to help defray some of the cost of mounting and displaying and hanging the artwork.

369
01:45:27,279 --> 01:45:28,520
[SPEAKER_18]: Those are gonna be great shows.

370
01:45:28,640 --> 01:45:31,222
[SPEAKER_18]: I think they're both in early May.

371
01:45:34,056 --> 01:45:44,185
[SPEAKER_18]: The Fine Arts Hall of Fame has been in existence at the McGlynn Middle School for the past five years, and we're gonna expand that to the Andrews Middle School this year, and hopefully to other schools in the following year.

372
01:45:47,008 --> 01:45:57,758
[SPEAKER_18]: Lastly, eight of our students have won Scholastic Art Awards this year, which I think is the most we've ever received in a single year, and we have a student who has been nominated for a National Award, so that's really exciting.

373
01:45:59,554 --> 01:46:09,196
[SPEAKER_18]: And just really quickly looking forward to 2023 and 2024 school year, we're excited to be working with Mr. Fallon, Ms.

374
01:46:09,236 --> 01:46:16,458
[SPEAKER_18]: Fitzpatrick and Mr. DeLeva to combine the arts into the CTE rotation for freshmen.

375
01:46:17,178 --> 01:46:23,960
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a pilot program and we're excited to build the connection between the vocational school and our arts programs.

376
01:46:24,898 --> 01:46:25,078
[SPEAKER_18]: Ms.

377
01:46:25,098 --> 01:46:40,713
[SPEAKER_18]: Rallo and I would like to plan some sort of arts week or arts month next school year that would be dedicated to showcasing student artwork in various locations throughout the district in tandem with some music and performance events as well.

378
01:46:40,733 --> 01:46:42,215
[SPEAKER_18]: So we'd like to try to coordinate that.

379
01:46:44,244 --> 01:46:49,046
[SPEAKER_18]: We have a new photography course being offered at the high school this year for the first time in a while.

380
01:46:49,867 --> 01:46:51,487
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm thrilled about that.

381
01:46:52,288 --> 01:46:54,309
[SPEAKER_18]: It's kind of been a void in our program.

382
01:46:54,829 --> 01:47:00,331
[SPEAKER_18]: Virtually every school in the surrounding communities and similar districts do offer some photography courses.

383
01:47:00,392 --> 01:47:07,355
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're starting with a digital photography course, and then hopefully in years to come, we can expand that to film photography.

384
01:47:08,496 --> 01:47:10,638
[SPEAKER_18]: And we also have a new art history course.

385
01:47:11,258 --> 01:47:14,440
[SPEAKER_18]: It's an art history and drawing course that's going to be offered as well.

386
01:47:16,041 --> 01:47:31,953
[SPEAKER_18]: And lastly, just looking towards next year, I wanna try to increase community collaboration, pulling in some more of our, the city is full of professionals and artists who I'm sure are willing to share their expertise and real world knowledge with our students.

387
01:47:31,973 --> 01:47:34,795
[SPEAKER_18]: So I wanna sort of explore that a little bit more.

388
01:47:35,854 --> 01:47:44,501
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm working with Arts Collaborative in Medford and hopefully we can develop a partnership so they can provide some meaningful art opportunities for our students outside of school.

389
01:47:46,682 --> 01:47:50,545
[SPEAKER_18]: And lastly, I wanna try to build some connections between our artists across grade levels.

390
01:47:50,605 --> 01:47:56,310
[SPEAKER_18]: So maybe our high school art clubs and middle school art clubs can collaborate and do some stuff together.

391
01:47:56,470 --> 01:48:02,515
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that would be nice to continue to foster that love of arts for our younger students.

392
01:48:03,717 --> 01:48:05,057
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's it, I'm gonna turn it over to Ms.

393
01:48:05,097 --> 01:48:06,838
[SPEAKER_18]: Rallo about performing arts.

394
01:48:08,279 --> 01:48:09,039
[SPEAKER_04]: And before you, Ms.

395
01:48:09,099 --> 01:48:15,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Rallo, before you start, I know we have a student spotlight, I see it in your presentation.

396
01:48:15,401 --> 01:48:15,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

397
01:48:15,621 --> 01:48:16,622
[SPEAKER_04]: He's here tonight.

398
01:48:17,362 --> 01:48:19,222
[SPEAKER_18]: I already took his picture for the next day.

399
01:48:19,282 --> 01:48:20,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, our student rep.

400
01:48:22,043 --> 01:48:23,104
[SPEAKER_07]: So I had to point that out.

401
01:48:24,664 --> 01:48:25,205
[SPEAKER_05]: Great job.

402
01:48:30,847 --> 01:48:31,967
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, so for performing arts,

403
01:48:33,440 --> 01:48:36,782
[SPEAKER_17]: We really focused this year on three main factors.

404
01:48:36,842 --> 01:48:42,025
[SPEAKER_17]: We embraced performance opportunities, we enhanced equipment needs, and we upgraded our facilities.

405
01:48:42,806 --> 01:48:50,030
[SPEAKER_17]: So when looking at our... You have a copy of this in front of you, right?

406
01:48:50,591 --> 01:48:51,071
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, perfect.

407
01:48:51,091 --> 01:48:52,952
[SPEAKER_17]: It wasn't on the screen.

408
01:48:54,633 --> 01:48:54,993
[SPEAKER_17]: That's all right.

409
01:48:55,834 --> 01:48:58,215
[SPEAKER_17]: So we started the year with our Jumpstart Music Camp in August.

410
01:48:58,976 --> 01:49:01,117
[SPEAKER_17]: We had over 70 students participate in the camp this year.

411
01:49:01,584 --> 01:49:05,028
[SPEAKER_17]: It's two weeks long with a performance at the end for all of our friends and family.

412
01:49:05,829 --> 01:49:09,833
[SPEAKER_17]: Students worked in sectionals, had outdoor game and snack time, as well as ensemble time.

413
01:49:10,493 --> 01:49:14,678
[SPEAKER_17]: And the wonderful thing is it's free to all Medford students entering grades four through eight, so.

414
01:49:15,279 --> 01:49:16,840
[SPEAKER_17]: really tried to expand on that this summer.

415
01:49:17,260 --> 01:49:22,163
[SPEAKER_17]: Last summer we had, the summer before, we had about around 50 students.

416
01:49:22,183 --> 01:49:25,045
[SPEAKER_17]: So every time we enroll, we get more and more.

417
01:49:25,125 --> 01:49:27,647
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're hoping to further that for the future.

418
01:49:28,968 --> 01:49:31,890
[SPEAKER_17]: Then we moved into marching band, which went through August to October.

419
01:49:32,690 --> 01:49:36,052
[SPEAKER_17]: This season, they attended five competitions and won nine trophies.

420
01:49:36,532 --> 01:49:40,435
[SPEAKER_17]: They placed second at the New England Scholastic Band Association's championship finals.

421
01:49:41,207 --> 01:49:43,689
[SPEAKER_17]: with a gold medal and best color guard for our division.

422
01:49:43,829 --> 01:49:45,170
[SPEAKER_17]: So they worked really hard this season.

423
01:49:45,190 --> 01:49:45,870
[SPEAKER_17]: They did really well.

424
01:49:47,431 --> 01:49:50,713
[SPEAKER_17]: We moved into football games in October and November.

425
01:49:51,694 --> 01:49:53,575
[SPEAKER_17]: This year, we got to go to Fenway Park.

426
01:49:54,076 --> 01:50:01,961
[SPEAKER_17]: So the students got the opportunity to play the national anthem at Fenway, and they also got to play stand tunes during halftime, be seen on the big jumbotron.

427
01:50:01,981 --> 01:50:02,821
[SPEAKER_17]: It was a big deal.

428
01:50:02,841 --> 01:50:03,822
[SPEAKER_17]: We were really excited about it.

429
01:50:05,252 --> 01:50:07,353
[SPEAKER_17]: From there, we moved into the fall play.

430
01:50:08,394 --> 01:50:09,755
[SPEAKER_17]: We hadn't had a fall play since 2019.

431
01:50:09,795 --> 01:50:13,917
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're really excited to bring this back after COVID.

432
01:50:13,997 --> 01:50:15,998
[SPEAKER_17]: I know it's way too long, but it's okay.

433
01:50:16,078 --> 01:50:16,659
[SPEAKER_17]: It all worked out.

434
01:50:17,279 --> 01:50:19,440
[SPEAKER_17]: It was directed by our faculty advisor, Riley Jones.

435
01:50:20,041 --> 01:50:21,741
[SPEAKER_17]: The students put on a really great production.

436
01:50:21,782 --> 01:50:25,884
[SPEAKER_17]: They had a lot of fun and it was really nice to see some theater going on in our theater again.

437
01:50:26,844 --> 01:50:31,147
[SPEAKER_17]: At the middle school and high school winter concerts, we head into that into December.

438
01:50:32,076 --> 01:50:41,949
[SPEAKER_17]: They featured our six through 12 band and orchestra programs, so they were able to highlight the middle school and high school ensembles.

439
01:50:42,670 --> 01:50:46,976
[SPEAKER_17]: We get to recognize our seniors and it's our last winter concert, so we get to kind of

440
01:50:47,483 --> 01:50:48,384
[SPEAKER_17]: know, move through that.

441
01:50:49,644 --> 01:50:52,866
[SPEAKER_17]: Moving on, we went to elementary winter concert, which is in January.

442
01:50:53,267 --> 01:50:57,849
[SPEAKER_17]: This featured our fifth grade strings, our select fifth grade band, and our Roberts hand chimes.

443
01:50:58,790 --> 01:51:03,453
[SPEAKER_17]: This is the very first time our fifth grade band ever got to perform in a winter concert.

444
01:51:03,633 --> 01:51:13,679
[SPEAKER_17]: Usually they work all year and perform the spring, but now that last year was the first year piloting our fourth grade band program, we now have a second year of elementary school band

445
01:51:14,159 --> 01:51:19,963
[SPEAKER_17]: it's a little bit more advanced, no longer beginners, so we threw this challenge at them and we had a bunch of students come play.

446
01:51:20,003 --> 01:51:31,172
[SPEAKER_17]: Some students got up and played solos, some of them played one piece at the end of the concert together, so they worked really hard and it was a big milestone for us to get that first elementary winter fan concert out there.

447
01:51:32,967 --> 01:51:35,148
[SPEAKER_17]: We brought back elementary assemblies.

448
01:51:36,029 --> 01:51:37,649
[SPEAKER_17]: We hadn't had those since pre-COVID.

449
01:51:38,770 --> 01:51:40,091
[SPEAKER_17]: The students were really excited.

450
01:51:41,071 --> 01:51:49,455
[SPEAKER_17]: We hadn't had a chance to get them all in the gym singing and making music together and playing instruments and showcasing and showing their peers what they've been working on.

451
01:51:49,875 --> 01:51:51,016
[SPEAKER_17]: So they were really excited about that.

452
01:51:51,056 --> 01:51:53,357
[SPEAKER_17]: There was some dancing, there were some orphan instruments.

453
01:51:54,137 --> 01:51:56,298
[SPEAKER_17]: There was lots of different exciting things.

454
01:51:56,318 --> 01:52:00,180
[SPEAKER_17]: So they did those at the elementary schools between November and February.

455
01:52:01,764 --> 01:52:06,449
[SPEAKER_17]: We're moving on to our Modern Music Ensemble, which is a class at the high school level that Ms.

456
01:52:06,489 --> 01:52:07,149
[SPEAKER_17]: Farr teaches.

457
01:52:08,190 --> 01:52:14,056
[SPEAKER_17]: They got to perform this year at MMEA, which is the Massachusetts Music Educators Association.

458
01:52:14,957 --> 01:52:16,638
[SPEAKER_17]: So they were chosen to go perform there.

459
01:52:16,658 --> 01:52:23,605
[SPEAKER_17]: In addition, Andrew Soule's original composition was recognized by MMEA's Contemporary Creators Festival.

460
01:52:24,525 --> 01:52:35,673
[SPEAKER_17]: All seven students participated in a composition and songwriting forum that included feedback on Andrew's work from composition and songwriting professors from Berkeley, UMass Lowell, and Boston Conservatory.

461
01:52:35,773 --> 01:52:37,614
[SPEAKER_17]: So they got to kind of break down his work.

462
01:52:37,654 --> 01:52:39,395
[SPEAKER_17]: The students got to perform it.

463
01:52:39,415 --> 01:52:40,416
[SPEAKER_17]: They had a really good time.

464
01:52:41,316 --> 01:52:42,897
[SPEAKER_17]: I think they all caught the performance bug.

465
01:52:42,957 --> 01:52:48,221
[SPEAKER_17]: So for some of them, they had never performed in front of people before, because it's a class during the day.

466
01:52:48,441 --> 01:52:51,543
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not a performance, necessarily a performance-based class.

467
01:52:52,948 --> 01:52:54,932
[SPEAKER_17]: they kind of got to get up and perform.

468
01:52:54,952 --> 01:52:59,802
[SPEAKER_17]: And now some of them are looking for more opportunities and they're really excited because they really, really enjoyed it.

469
01:52:59,822 --> 01:52:59,862
[SPEAKER_17]: So.

470
01:53:02,072 --> 01:53:06,893
[SPEAKER_17]: Jayden Veal was selected to perform with the Northeast Junior District Orchestra.

471
01:53:07,293 --> 01:53:09,914
[SPEAKER_17]: So Jayden is a freshman violinist at Medford High School.

472
01:53:10,374 --> 01:53:13,735
[SPEAKER_17]: He auditioned and was selected from hundreds of students across the district to participate.

473
01:53:14,595 --> 01:53:17,996
[SPEAKER_17]: The district orchestra has performed at Galvin Middle School in Wakefield, Mass.

474
01:53:18,016 --> 01:53:18,776
[SPEAKER_17]: this past weekend.

475
01:53:19,276 --> 01:53:20,296
[SPEAKER_17]: So congrats to Jayden.

476
01:53:20,356 --> 01:53:21,336
[SPEAKER_17]: It's really exciting.

477
01:53:21,597 --> 01:53:23,217
[SPEAKER_17]: Giving a little rep to Medford.

478
01:53:24,790 --> 01:53:26,512
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's kind of our performance opportunities.

479
01:53:26,853 --> 01:53:29,096
[SPEAKER_17]: So looking at enhancing our equipment needs.

480
01:53:30,077 --> 01:53:33,041
[SPEAKER_17]: We also moved on to that to do some upgrades.

481
01:53:33,061 --> 01:53:38,669
[SPEAKER_17]: So we got some new computers in the high school music tech lab from Tufts University prior to

482
01:53:40,271 --> 01:53:45,916
[SPEAKER_17]: Prior to this year, we had 10 computers, so the class is maxed out at 20 students.

483
01:53:45,956 --> 01:53:50,659
[SPEAKER_17]: We had two students sharing one computer, but now we actually have 20 computers.

484
01:53:50,719 --> 01:53:57,405
[SPEAKER_17]: Now every student has their own keyboard, has their own computer, and can kind of work on their own projects, which is really great to expand that.

485
01:53:58,612 --> 01:54:00,913
[SPEAKER_17]: We ordered some new keyboards for the McGlynn Middle School.

486
01:54:01,234 --> 01:54:03,255
[SPEAKER_17]: Last year, the Andrews got keyboard updates.

487
01:54:03,275 --> 01:54:05,116
[SPEAKER_17]: So this year, McGlynn got keyboard updates.

488
01:54:06,117 --> 01:54:08,738
[SPEAKER_17]: We got some new ukuleles for the Brooks Elementary School.

489
01:54:08,919 --> 01:54:09,059
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

490
01:54:09,079 --> 01:54:10,500
[SPEAKER_17]: Turner does a ukulele program there.

491
01:54:11,020 --> 01:54:13,982
[SPEAKER_17]: So we ordered some additional ones so that students don't have to share equipment.

492
01:54:14,322 --> 01:54:15,743
[SPEAKER_17]: We can have extra resources.

493
01:54:16,984 --> 01:54:19,465
[SPEAKER_17]: We did some new fourth and fifth grade string repairs.

494
01:54:19,925 --> 01:54:25,309
[SPEAKER_17]: So we have a program where students in fourth and fifth grade can rent an instrument from the district instead of renting it from

495
01:54:26,520 --> 01:54:30,503
[SPEAKER_17]: from an outside vendor so we can keep the cost down and provide more opportunities for students.

496
01:54:31,224 --> 01:54:37,289
[SPEAKER_17]: But over the last few years, we have had a lot of repairs that needed to get done that haven't necessarily gotten done.

497
01:54:37,389 --> 01:54:43,534
[SPEAKER_17]: So we jumped on that this year and started repairing them so we can have more instruments available for our students for next year.

498
01:54:44,515 --> 01:54:49,116
[SPEAKER_17]: And we also received new touch view boards for general music classrooms.

499
01:54:49,156 --> 01:54:53,478
[SPEAKER_17]: So now every general music classroom K through 12 has a touch view board.

500
01:54:54,558 --> 01:54:55,758
[SPEAKER_17]: Two of them are already installed.

501
01:54:55,778 --> 01:54:59,879
[SPEAKER_17]: The other ones are coming, but they'll be able to project on there.

502
01:54:59,919 --> 01:55:01,420
[SPEAKER_17]: They can put class websites on there.

503
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:03,040
[SPEAKER_17]: There are pens that come with them.

504
01:55:03,160 --> 01:55:07,061
[SPEAKER_17]: So the students can compose music and they can draw and they can write on them.

505
01:55:07,862 --> 01:55:12,363
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a great visual and music tool that we can use in the classroom.

506
01:55:12,691 --> 01:55:15,633
[SPEAKER_17]: you can split the board so multiple students can work at them at the same time.

507
01:55:15,753 --> 01:55:24,577
[SPEAKER_17]: So a lot of other classrooms in the district also received them this year, but there's some really cool music specific opportunities we can do with them.

508
01:55:24,597 --> 01:55:26,438
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're excited to say we have one.

509
01:55:26,639 --> 01:55:29,200
[SPEAKER_17]: We will have one by the end of this year in every general music classroom.

510
01:55:31,586 --> 01:55:38,348
[SPEAKER_17]: Moving on to facility updates, we have a new guitar storage closet.

511
01:55:38,888 --> 01:55:49,611
[SPEAKER_17]: So over quarantine, we purchased additional guitars so that every student taking guitar at the high school level could get a guitar dropped off at their house and they could play

512
01:55:50,131 --> 01:55:58,738
[SPEAKER_17]: and practice and get the experience of taking the class online with an actual instrument, which meant we had a lot of additional instruments and not a lot of space.

513
01:55:58,998 --> 01:56:04,223
[SPEAKER_17]: So luckily, Buildings and Grounds is able to build a nice guitar storage for us.

514
01:56:04,323 --> 01:56:06,404
[SPEAKER_17]: We took part of a hallway and made that.

515
01:56:06,484 --> 01:56:08,346
[SPEAKER_17]: So now we have enough space there.

516
01:56:08,366 --> 01:56:11,689
[SPEAKER_17]: So now if students want to sign one out or bring one home, they're able to do so.

517
01:56:12,269 --> 01:56:14,391
[SPEAKER_17]: And we can maintain them and keep them in a nice facility.

518
01:56:15,404 --> 01:56:21,607
[SPEAKER_17]: We have a new arts workspace, our conflab lab, which is a place where both art and music can come and collaborate.

519
01:56:22,487 --> 01:56:27,770
[SPEAKER_17]: The term conflab means to get together for an informal discussion to solve problems.

520
01:56:28,430 --> 01:56:31,131
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's kind of our little lab to do that.

521
01:56:31,672 --> 01:56:38,955
[SPEAKER_17]: We are able to work together, have a nice big space where we can kind of just collaborate and solve all the problems of the world through art and music.

522
01:56:40,322 --> 01:56:48,271
[SPEAKER_17]: We have some new bulletin boards to showcase things like our new newsletter, some student updates, schedules, things to keep the students informed.

523
01:56:48,911 --> 01:56:49,112
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

524
01:56:49,132 --> 01:56:51,254
[SPEAKER_17]: Fard has a new gig board outside her classroom.

525
01:56:51,354 --> 01:57:02,386
[SPEAKER_17]: So every time she gets word of a new gig or new opportunities for college or different things going on in the community, she can put it on there and the students can come by and they can grab something so they can look for some more.

526
01:57:02,813 --> 01:57:03,773
[SPEAKER_17]: performance opportunities.

527
01:57:04,474 --> 01:57:05,454
[SPEAKER_17]: That was a big thing this year.

528
01:57:05,534 --> 01:57:10,877
[SPEAKER_17]: And we have some new lighting for our high school trophy case, which was built by Alex Lee, who's an alumni.

529
01:57:10,897 --> 01:57:15,319
[SPEAKER_17]: It was his Eagle Scout project a few years ago, and it's in this really dark hallway.

530
01:57:15,379 --> 01:57:21,581
[SPEAKER_17]: So we purchased some lighting for it to kind of fix it up and make it look really bright and shiny when you walk into by the theater.

531
01:57:21,601 --> 01:57:26,744
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think you can go on, Peter.

532
01:57:28,264 --> 01:57:28,585
[SPEAKER_17]: There we go.

533
01:57:28,605 --> 01:57:31,686
[SPEAKER_17]: There's Sarah in her new closet, really exciting.

534
01:57:35,020 --> 01:57:37,584
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, so moving on to what's coming up.

535
01:57:37,664 --> 01:57:39,547
[SPEAKER_17]: On the first, our winter guard finals.

536
01:57:40,168 --> 01:57:42,811
[SPEAKER_17]: So our winter color guard is currently undefeated this year.

537
01:57:42,831 --> 01:57:46,276
[SPEAKER_17]: This is the, I know it's really great, they're awesome.

538
01:57:48,850 --> 01:57:50,672
[SPEAKER_17]: Their championship finals are on the first.

539
01:57:51,173 --> 01:58:00,621
[SPEAKER_17]: This is the fifth year in a row they've been undefeated, so they're kind of a force to be reckoned with, and they're coming in hard for finals, so we're excited for them.

540
01:58:01,642 --> 01:58:06,607
[SPEAKER_17]: The high school orchestra is also competing at MICA on that day, so busy day for us.

541
01:58:07,208 --> 01:58:12,313
[SPEAKER_17]: On the 15th, the band is heading to Disney World, and they're performing in Disney World on the 15th.

542
01:58:13,293 --> 01:58:16,234
[SPEAKER_17]: The 27th and 29th is the spring musical.

543
01:58:16,294 --> 01:58:18,535
[SPEAKER_17]: They're doing Urinetown in the theater at the high school.

544
01:58:19,336 --> 01:58:24,077
[SPEAKER_17]: On the 6th, the band and orchestra is going to compete in a music festival at Six Flags.

545
01:58:25,098 --> 01:58:27,659
[SPEAKER_17]: May 3rd to 17th, there are spring concerts this year.

546
01:58:28,639 --> 01:58:32,620
[SPEAKER_17]: And we just received a grant, so the Boston Saxophone Quartet is going to be coming.

547
01:58:33,721 --> 01:58:39,723
[SPEAKER_17]: We got accepted to their Noteworthy Scholars Program, where they'll be coming in and they'll be doing two clinics with us and a performance.

548
01:58:40,003 --> 01:58:47,025
[SPEAKER_17]: They're going to work with the students on things like intonation and improvisation, performance anxiety, all kinds of fun things.

549
01:58:47,105 --> 01:58:51,747
[SPEAKER_17]: So we have those two clinics coming up, but they have not been put on the calendar yet.

550
01:58:53,955 --> 01:59:00,000
[SPEAKER_17]: Looking forward to the future for the elementary level for next year.

551
01:59:00,040 --> 01:59:02,963
[SPEAKER_17]: We're hoping to increase more performance opportunities.

552
01:59:03,744 --> 01:59:07,106
[SPEAKER_17]: We're hoping to bring back the troublemakers chorus, which is grades two to five.

553
01:59:08,868 --> 01:59:14,753
[SPEAKER_17]: We're hoping to collaborate with the school principals and increasing and adding musical guests for assemblies and music related field trips.

554
01:59:15,393 --> 01:59:20,017
[SPEAKER_17]: All elementary school students used to take music field trips in the past, but those obviously were taken out due to COVID.

555
01:59:20,037 --> 01:59:20,878
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're hoping to kind of

556
01:59:21,398 --> 01:59:22,939
[SPEAKER_17]: work with the principals to get those back in.

557
01:59:22,959 --> 01:59:31,463
[SPEAKER_17]: It was really fun to kind of teach the students about live performances and how to be a good audience member and get to take them places and show them live performances.

558
01:59:31,563 --> 01:59:33,944
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're really hoping to get that, get that back.

559
01:59:34,864 --> 01:59:38,826
[SPEAKER_17]: At the middle school level, we're also looking to increase performance opportunities.

560
01:59:39,246 --> 01:59:41,307
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to continue upgrading general music equipment.

561
01:59:41,527 --> 01:59:47,290
[SPEAKER_17]: So in the last two years, the middle schools have received guitars, they received ukuleles, now they both have received keyboards.

562
01:59:47,830 --> 01:59:48,971
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're working really hard to

563
01:59:49,551 --> 01:59:54,694
[SPEAKER_17]: maintain what we have and also increase more opportunities as the students come up with more and more talent.

564
01:59:56,034 --> 02:00:02,838
[SPEAKER_17]: We're also hoping to collaborate with the principals to bring back the chorus at the middle school level and also develop a visual and performing arts day.

565
02:00:02,918 --> 02:00:03,198
[SPEAKER_17]: As Ms.

566
02:00:03,218 --> 02:00:10,382
[SPEAKER_17]: Fee had kind of mentioned, we're really looking at showcasing what we have and how to get more students involved and show them how they can get involved.

567
02:00:10,462 --> 02:00:13,244
[SPEAKER_17]: So at the high school level, we're looking for

568
02:00:14,588 --> 02:00:16,831
[SPEAKER_17]: collaborating with principals to bring back the chorus again.

569
02:00:17,332 --> 02:00:18,713
[SPEAKER_17]: We are currently in chorus lists.

570
02:00:19,534 --> 02:00:24,320
[SPEAKER_17]: We're hoping to expand our theater program and we're looking to develop the visual performing arts day.

571
02:00:24,360 --> 02:00:28,886
[SPEAKER_17]: So the high school will go down to the middle school and they'll work with them and it'd be a really good collaboration.

572
02:00:29,627 --> 02:00:30,769
[SPEAKER_17]: As far as outside of school,

573
02:00:31,977 --> 02:00:33,078
[SPEAKER_17]: hopes and dreams go.

574
02:00:33,458 --> 02:00:37,001
[SPEAKER_17]: We're looking to expand the Jump Start Music Camp to provide more offerings.

575
02:00:37,842 --> 02:00:40,563
[SPEAKER_17]: We're looking to bring the Drama Club back to Drama Fest.

576
02:00:41,064 --> 02:00:53,953
[SPEAKER_17]: That's something that we used to do in the past where we would compete in a one-act play and get to work with other schools as part of METG, which is the Massachusetts Education Theater Association, sorry, Guild.

577
02:00:54,688 --> 02:01:01,170
[SPEAKER_17]: And we got to go to clinics and the students could enter workshops and different contests.

578
02:01:01,210 --> 02:01:02,510
[SPEAKER_17]: It was really exciting.

579
02:01:03,570 --> 02:01:06,831
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're looking for more clinics and workshops for the instrumental students.

580
02:01:06,891 --> 02:01:12,993
[SPEAKER_17]: So we used to bring in a lot of guests in the last few years, but obviously COVID kind of put a little damper on that.

581
02:01:13,013 --> 02:01:22,475
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're looking at having some guest conductors come back in, some clinicians, some masterclasses, so that the students can really get into furthering their performing arts education.

582
02:01:24,360 --> 02:01:26,081
[SPEAKER_17]: But you're welcome.

583
02:01:29,703 --> 02:01:30,304
[SPEAKER_19]: Any questions?

584
02:01:31,144 --> 02:01:31,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Graham?

585
02:01:33,385 --> 02:01:39,969
[SPEAKER_19]: We were talking actually at the last meeting about theater not being part of the school day.

586
02:01:39,989 --> 02:01:43,231
[SPEAKER_19]: And it sounds like that's on the plan for next year.

587
02:01:43,251 --> 02:01:43,532
[SPEAKER_19]: Is that true?

588
02:01:43,632 --> 02:01:44,732
[SPEAKER_19]: It is, fingers crossed.

589
02:01:44,752 --> 02:01:50,356
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're hoping that theater will be one of the tracks that students will go through as part of the freshman exploratory class.

590
02:01:50,476 --> 02:01:53,498
[SPEAKER_17]: And then further than that, as a sophomore,

591
02:01:54,378 --> 02:01:58,501
[SPEAKER_17]: We need to bring back the intro to American musical theater class and the advanced technical theater class.

592
02:01:58,921 --> 02:02:05,747
[SPEAKER_17]: So the intro to American musical theater class addressed all the performance, um, opportunities to students that wanted to be in the spotlight.

593
02:02:05,787 --> 02:02:11,991
[SPEAKER_17]: They wanted to learn dancing and singing and improvisation and stage fighting and combat and all kinds of fun things.

594
02:02:12,552 --> 02:02:15,994
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, and then we had the advanced technical theater class, which is for everyone who wanted to be behind the scenes.

595
02:02:16,435 --> 02:02:19,717
[SPEAKER_17]: That was like stage craft and lighting and sound design and programming.

596
02:02:20,157 --> 02:02:20,758
[SPEAKER_17]: So, um,

597
02:02:22,219 --> 02:02:28,241
[SPEAKER_17]: make sure we had a class for both students, because they're different needs, but hopefully that will run for next year.

598
02:02:28,722 --> 02:02:35,805
[SPEAKER_19]: And do we have teachers in our rank to do that now, or is that something that we'll have to prioritize at budget time?

599
02:02:36,525 --> 02:02:42,608
[SPEAKER_17]: We currently don't have any teachers in the performing arts besides myself that are certified in theater education.

600
02:02:42,668 --> 02:02:42,788
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

601
02:02:43,648 --> 02:02:43,968
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

602
02:02:43,988 --> 02:02:44,749
[SPEAKER_04]: That's helpful.

603
02:02:45,649 --> 02:02:45,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

604
02:02:48,631 --> 02:02:49,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Ruseau?

605
02:02:49,773 --> 02:02:50,133
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

606
02:02:50,753 --> 02:02:52,054
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm very excited by photography.

607
02:02:52,114 --> 02:02:54,195
[SPEAKER_14]: My daughter is very excited by photography.

608
02:02:54,215 --> 02:02:55,936
[SPEAKER_18]: I hope that- Yeah, the students are all abuzz.

609
02:02:56,396 --> 02:02:57,476
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, all abuzz.

610
02:02:57,797 --> 02:03:11,222
[SPEAKER_14]: And obviously photography is a little different now than when I was a student, but we're doing digital photography because, you know, the other stuff requires a lot.

611
02:03:11,423 --> 02:03:13,223
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

612
02:03:13,443 --> 02:03:15,104
[SPEAKER_14]: But will students be,

613
02:03:17,679 --> 02:03:20,861
[SPEAKER_14]: required to bring their own equipment and what kind of equipment requirements will be there?

614
02:03:20,901 --> 02:03:31,247
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're trying to get some digital cameras, but we've structured the class so that everything could be done using their phones actually, which they do have pretty advanced phones now.

615
02:03:31,928 --> 02:03:37,691
[SPEAKER_18]: And we used to have a dark room at Medford High that we're hoping to try to resurrect.

616
02:03:37,731 --> 02:03:44,095
[SPEAKER_18]: We need to solve some ventilation issues so that the following year we could hopefully offer film photography as well.

617
02:03:44,235 --> 02:03:46,857
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's an exciting new development.

618
02:03:47,366 --> 02:03:47,606
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

619
02:03:47,626 --> 02:03:48,187
[SPEAKER_14]: That's exciting.

620
02:03:48,207 --> 02:04:04,861
[SPEAKER_14]: I know when my daughter mentioned it when she was doing her fall selections, I did not know that you can buy for like 20 bucks, really amazing equipment to attach to your iPhone and turn them into like equipment that didn't even exist when I was a kid.

621
02:04:06,102 --> 02:04:07,724
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's kind of amazing how

622
02:04:08,462 --> 02:04:12,324
[SPEAKER_14]: the bar is much lower to be able to do some great stuff.

623
02:04:12,344 --> 02:04:13,424
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's exciting.

624
02:04:13,584 --> 02:04:13,844
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

625
02:04:13,864 --> 02:04:18,547
[SPEAKER_18]: And Mr. Kane started a photography club this year to sort of help generate interest.

626
02:04:18,627 --> 02:04:23,849
[SPEAKER_18]: And he applied for a Medford Educational Fund grant and received a nice photo printer.

627
02:04:24,289 --> 02:04:27,170
[SPEAKER_18]: So we'll be able to start showcasing the work right away.

628
02:04:27,531 --> 02:04:27,951
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.

629
02:04:27,991 --> 02:04:28,391
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

630
02:04:28,471 --> 02:04:28,831
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

631
02:04:34,234 --> 02:04:36,395
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for the wonderful presentation and all the hard work.

632
02:04:36,515 --> 02:04:37,195
[SPEAKER_07]: We appreciate it.

633
02:04:41,576 --> 02:04:47,783
[SPEAKER_04]: Next, we have an update on the before and after school program, Miss Megan Fiddler-Carrie, Director of Family and Community Engagement.

634
02:04:48,223 --> 02:04:48,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome.

635
02:04:48,944 --> 02:04:50,005
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello, welcome.

636
02:04:50,746 --> 02:04:51,186
[SPEAKER_10]: Good evening.

637
02:04:51,226 --> 02:04:52,167
[SPEAKER_10]: It's nice to see you all.

638
02:04:53,189 --> 02:04:59,996
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for this opportunity for my biannual update about before and after school, where I kind of give you

639
02:05:00,965 --> 02:05:11,549
[SPEAKER_10]: A purpose for today will be just a snapshot on the state of the program for both before and after school, where we are, how many students we have, what the makeup of the students are that are currently attending.

640
02:05:11,569 --> 02:05:28,736
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I have some proposals I'd like to run by you so that we can continue our discussions about keeping affordability for after school families, but also the retention rate for the before and after school staff who we know

641
02:05:29,543 --> 02:05:34,889
[SPEAKER_10]: You've heard me several times say that it's kind of a tricky time period of the day to hire for.

642
02:05:35,069 --> 02:05:45,540
[SPEAKER_10]: So I want to make it an attractive job for quality people, qualified applicants.

643
02:05:46,280 --> 02:05:48,583
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'll just get into the current state of the program.

644
02:05:48,983 --> 02:05:51,786
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to include some background in case there's anybody watching.

645
02:05:52,179 --> 02:05:56,101
[SPEAKER_10]: who's new to the Medford public schools and hasn't heard me talk about that before and after school.

646
02:05:56,501 --> 02:05:58,903
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that a lot of people are registering for kindergarten now.

647
02:05:59,663 --> 02:06:03,785
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll talk about the applying for the lottery for people for next year.

648
02:06:04,246 --> 02:06:06,047
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll talk about that a little bit later in the presentation.

649
02:06:06,147 --> 02:06:15,572
[SPEAKER_10]: So before and after school programs are at all four of the elementary schools in Medford, before school for one hour and after school from dismissal until six o'clock.

650
02:06:16,412 --> 02:06:21,135
[SPEAKER_10]: And it will be the same on the early release Wednesdays next year from dismissal until six o'clock.

651
02:06:23,604 --> 02:06:27,127
[SPEAKER_10]: We have, it's broken down into four sections.

652
02:06:27,527 --> 02:06:41,257
[SPEAKER_10]: We have snack, homework time, physical runaround education, physical time where the students can have an unstructured time to play, and then a structured block where we have our staff do organized activity that's either

653
02:06:41,941 --> 02:06:48,766
[SPEAKER_10]: It can be a physical game if that's what the kids are interested in and the teachers are interested in, or it can be an activity or a craft.

654
02:06:49,507 --> 02:07:01,756
[SPEAKER_10]: And we try and keep our ratios, our staff-student ratios, one staff for every 10 students, and that's recommended as best practice from surrounding areas and also from the Department of Early Education and Care.

655
02:07:02,057 --> 02:07:06,941
[SPEAKER_10]: That's their recommended ratio for licensed programs, so we really try to stick to that.

656
02:07:10,455 --> 02:07:21,224
[SPEAKER_10]: We want to provide families with affordable care so we we've got a competitive rate for tuition in place and when I say competitive, I'm always looking at surrounding towns.

657
02:07:21,844 --> 02:07:24,427
[SPEAKER_10]: Many of you have heard me say a bazillion times that I'm on.

658
02:07:25,307 --> 02:07:27,309
[SPEAKER_10]: It's called the network of extended day directors.

659
02:07:27,796 --> 02:07:33,760
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a council of different after school directors from all over Massachusetts who have district run programs like ours.

660
02:07:34,200 --> 02:07:38,382
[SPEAKER_10]: We get together every other month and we email each other constantly with questions.

661
02:07:38,943 --> 02:07:44,206
[SPEAKER_10]: And we compare notes all the time about pay rates, tuition rates, best practices.

662
02:07:44,646 --> 02:07:49,049
[SPEAKER_10]: So our rates are competitive compared to our surrounding towns.

663
02:07:49,625 --> 02:07:51,507
[SPEAKER_10]: and also compared to Ned's data.

664
02:07:52,728 --> 02:07:59,994
[SPEAKER_10]: We also have a sliding scale of financial assistance for families who demonstrate need and who qualify.

665
02:08:02,075 --> 02:08:05,959
[SPEAKER_10]: So I've got some real details in here for you.

666
02:08:06,479 --> 02:08:08,561
[SPEAKER_10]: This is our current state of the before and after school.

667
02:08:08,621 --> 02:08:12,044
[SPEAKER_10]: Our current rate for before school programming is $140 a month if you attend for five days.

668
02:08:16,172 --> 02:08:18,653
[SPEAKER_10]: and $104 a month if you attend for only three days.

669
02:08:18,753 --> 02:08:21,774
[SPEAKER_10]: And that has stayed constant for more than five years.

670
02:08:22,214 --> 02:08:27,276
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just want to point out that that rate has not moved in the last five years for before school.

671
02:08:27,756 --> 02:08:31,377
[SPEAKER_10]: Our current daily rate for the afterschool program is about $26 a day.

672
02:08:31,857 --> 02:08:38,559
[SPEAKER_10]: So families who have five days a week in afterschool pays $475 a month.

673
02:08:40,119 --> 02:08:41,480
[SPEAKER_10]: I know I'm throwing a lot of numbers out.

674
02:08:42,318 --> 02:08:44,160
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me know if I'm confusing it a little bit.

675
02:08:44,500 --> 02:08:49,526
[SPEAKER_10]: But this, I know that this slide presentation is available on websites.

676
02:08:49,586 --> 02:08:53,550
[SPEAKER_10]: So if anybody watching wants to go back and look at it, those will be available.

677
02:08:56,193 --> 02:09:01,359
[SPEAKER_10]: In comparison, like I said, comparison to our other districts, we're neither the cheapest or the most expensive.

678
02:09:01,399 --> 02:09:02,440
[SPEAKER_10]: We're about right in the middle.

679
02:09:07,368 --> 02:09:25,483
[SPEAKER_10]: The makeup of our after-school program is we are overseen by Suzanne Galusi, the Assistant Superintendent of Academics and Instruction, myself, the Director of Family and Community Engagement, and my office is at the high school, but I spend a lot of time visiting the other schools to check in, to evaluate, and also to pitch in.

680
02:09:25,623 --> 02:09:31,448
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, whenever we have staff out, I have the opportunity to pitch in and help out, which is actually really fun.

681
02:09:32,816 --> 02:09:39,178
[SPEAKER_10]: And then at each of the elementary schools at the sites, we have a site coordinator who is sort of the principal of that program.

682
02:09:39,618 --> 02:09:47,741
[SPEAKER_10]: And then group leaders, in some cases, senior group leaders for our bigger programs where we need senior group leaders who can mentor the other staff and the new staff.

683
02:09:48,522 --> 02:09:54,764
[SPEAKER_10]: Group leaders who are like the teachers and they're the ones that plan that fourth block that I described, the activity, the structured activity.

684
02:09:55,407 --> 02:09:57,488
[SPEAKER_10]: assistant group leaders, and high school aides.

685
02:09:57,769 --> 02:09:59,410
[SPEAKER_10]: And our high school aides are invaluable.

686
02:09:59,750 --> 02:10:02,792
[SPEAKER_10]: We love them, but we can't leave students alone with them.

687
02:10:02,852 --> 02:10:06,195
[SPEAKER_10]: So they do not contribute to that 10 to one ratio that I mentioned earlier.

688
02:10:06,415 --> 02:10:07,816
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's really important to point out.

689
02:10:09,437 --> 02:10:11,638
[SPEAKER_10]: They're very helpful with homework help.

690
02:10:12,339 --> 02:10:18,363
[SPEAKER_10]: We give them a lot of training on how not to give the answers, but they are a lot closer to the math curriculum age-wise than a lot of our staff.

691
02:10:18,383 --> 02:10:20,565
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's really imperative that we have those high school helpers.

692
02:10:21,626 --> 02:10:24,948
[SPEAKER_10]: And the coordinators, and it's really important to note that all of

693
02:10:25,421 --> 02:10:32,665
[SPEAKER_10]: These staff are budgeted, the pay for their salaries comes out of the tuitions that are paid for the before and after school program.

694
02:10:33,006 --> 02:10:37,869
[SPEAKER_10]: So I wanna make clear that money coming in helps with money going out.

695
02:10:39,870 --> 02:10:40,970
[SPEAKER_10]: Here are our current numbers.

696
02:10:41,090 --> 02:10:42,992
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that this is, oh, can we go back one?

697
02:10:45,513 --> 02:10:46,774
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, no, the current, no, you're right.

698
02:10:47,094 --> 02:10:48,095
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, these are current numbers.

699
02:10:48,175 --> 02:10:51,257
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought that I had the after school first, but I put the before school numbers first.

700
02:10:51,917 --> 02:10:55,019
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have 40 students at the Brooks, 20 at the McGlynn,

701
02:10:56,098 --> 02:10:58,599
[SPEAKER_10]: 17 at the Missittuck, and 26 at the Roberts.

702
02:10:59,120 --> 02:11:01,661
[SPEAKER_10]: We've been fortunate that we haven't had gigantic wait lists.

703
02:11:02,121 --> 02:11:14,346
[SPEAKER_10]: We do at the Roberts because it's a staffing, it's also a capacity, it's about the needs of our students that are in our program and how much supervision they need.

704
02:11:14,606 --> 02:11:23,390
[SPEAKER_10]: So when we think about taking students off of our wait lists, we have to think about the students that we have in front of us and which staff members we have to meet those needs.

705
02:11:24,598 --> 02:11:26,859
[SPEAKER_10]: So staffing is challenging at the before school.

706
02:11:27,019 --> 02:11:28,880
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all staffed by teachers and paras.

707
02:11:29,020 --> 02:11:33,922
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't have outside people that only come and work in the before school program and then leave.

708
02:11:35,683 --> 02:11:36,603
[SPEAKER_10]: It's before school paras.

709
02:11:36,704 --> 02:11:45,687
[SPEAKER_10]: And I will note also, this will come up later, the pay for before school teachers also hasn't changed in several years.

710
02:11:46,408 --> 02:11:48,169
[SPEAKER_10]: And I wanna talk to you a little bit about that.

711
02:11:49,049 --> 02:11:49,889
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, next slide, please.

712
02:11:50,450 --> 02:11:52,791
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is the numbers for the after school program.

713
02:11:54,206 --> 02:11:59,251
[SPEAKER_10]: You'll look at these numbers, but I do wanna, I would like all of you to recall that we had a discussion.

714
02:11:59,331 --> 02:12:01,953
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure if it was the last time I was here or when I was here in the fall.

715
02:12:03,194 --> 02:12:08,179
[SPEAKER_10]: We've talked about, instead of talking about how many students are in a program, we talk about how many seats are in a program.

716
02:12:08,259 --> 02:12:19,189
[SPEAKER_10]: So when we're talking about wait lists, it's really important to talk about seats, the number of seats, and that's how many kids are there on a given day, how many kids we have capacity to support on a given day.

717
02:12:19,591 --> 02:12:24,233
[SPEAKER_10]: versus these numbers that you're looking at right now, which is how many students are on our roster.

718
02:12:24,653 --> 02:12:26,774
[SPEAKER_10]: So not all of these students come every day.

719
02:12:27,294 --> 02:12:31,196
[SPEAKER_10]: Students can come to the afterschool program two, three, or five days a week.

720
02:12:32,997 --> 02:12:36,058
[SPEAKER_10]: And so these numbers don't represent a given day.

721
02:12:36,098 --> 02:12:41,500
[SPEAKER_10]: They represent the total number of students that I have contact information for and emergency information for.

722
02:12:42,821 --> 02:12:44,822
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'll give you a second to look at those numbers.

723
02:12:47,298 --> 02:12:51,699
[SPEAKER_10]: you'll notice that the wait lists are significant, especially at the Brooks and the Roberts.

724
02:12:52,640 --> 02:12:55,981
[SPEAKER_10]: And we do our best to look at them very closely.

725
02:12:56,001 --> 02:13:00,702
[SPEAKER_10]: If there's any movement, we reach out to the people on the wait list, the next on the list.

726
02:13:00,782 --> 02:13:08,744
[SPEAKER_10]: And if somebody who was only there for two days leaves, I call, and even if the person has told me they need five days, I call and say, well, would these two days be helpful to you?

727
02:13:09,505 --> 02:13:13,106
[SPEAKER_10]: And if they say, no, we really only need five, I go down to the next person on the list.

728
02:13:13,266 --> 02:13:14,106
[SPEAKER_10]: That's how it's been working.

729
02:13:17,763 --> 02:13:21,505
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is the demographic information that has been requested for me in the past.

730
02:13:22,185 --> 02:13:24,566
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is the whole before and after school program.

731
02:13:24,946 --> 02:13:31,649
[SPEAKER_10]: We met about this as a team and I was starting to look at it and breaking it down by before school and after school and the different, the four schools.

732
02:13:31,689 --> 02:13:37,431
[SPEAKER_10]: And we realized that we might be getting a little close to violating some FERPA confidentiality for students.

733
02:13:37,751 --> 02:13:41,772
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's why you have it in aggregate for the whole before and after school programs.

734
02:13:44,233 --> 02:13:46,114
[SPEAKER_09]: But we wanted to just show that information.

735
02:13:50,362 --> 02:13:56,788
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, now I know many, if some people have tuned in just for the before and after school program, they're probably interested in this information.

736
02:13:58,089 --> 02:14:08,878
[SPEAKER_10]: For new students coming to Medford next year who are not current students in the Medford Public School Program, there is a lottery for the open spots that will start on April 1st.

737
02:14:09,899 --> 02:14:17,905
[SPEAKER_10]: Application and sign up for that lottery will be open from April 1st until April 13th, and then the lottery will run on April 14th.

738
02:14:19,275 --> 02:14:23,936
[SPEAKER_10]: There's going to be a Google form that I'll put up on April 1st on our website.

739
02:14:23,996 --> 02:14:25,537
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll be on our main page.

740
02:14:25,817 --> 02:14:27,857
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll be on the before and after school website.

741
02:14:28,398 --> 02:14:34,359
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll have links to it on the Facebook page, which if you're interested in after school, I encourage everyone to follow us at after Medford.

742
02:14:34,840 --> 02:14:37,660
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a, there's a final slide at the end with that information as well.

743
02:14:38,201 --> 02:14:46,663
[SPEAKER_10]: But this, I don't want to put it up any earlier than that because I don't want to confuse people to think that if they've engaged with that form at all, that they've already signed up.

744
02:14:47,185 --> 02:14:54,170
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm waiting until April 1st to even put the Google form on the website, but that will be available on April 1st.

745
02:14:54,771 --> 02:14:55,591
[SPEAKER_04]: And Ms.

746
02:14:56,292 --> 02:14:58,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Fidlikary, is the lottery new?

747
02:14:59,694 --> 02:15:02,156
[SPEAKER_10]: No, this will be the third year that we've run the lottery.

748
02:15:02,256 --> 02:15:06,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Third year that you've run the lottery, but there's still a wait list proponent to it.

749
02:15:07,020 --> 02:15:09,541
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is a great question.

750
02:15:09,561 --> 02:15:12,864
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm glad you brought this up because this is very worth clarification.

751
02:15:13,144 --> 02:15:14,385
[SPEAKER_10]: So wait lists,

752
02:15:16,153 --> 02:15:19,037
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not one spot for one spot in our afterschool program.

753
02:15:19,457 --> 02:15:28,928
[SPEAKER_10]: We have grade groups, because for example, if a spot opens up in fifth grade, but there's a kindergartner on the wait list, we can't put the kindergartner in the fifth grade grade group.

754
02:15:29,727 --> 02:15:49,504
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's really important to note that our wait lists, so the open spots we'll have available are mostly at the kindergarten level, because as everybody's graduated up, the fifth graders have gone on to middle school, but the fourth graders are now fifth graders, and the people on that wait list are still on that wait list.

755
02:15:49,624 --> 02:15:56,349
[SPEAKER_10]: They can't have a kindergarten spot because it wouldn't work to put fourth graders in the kindergarten grade group.

756
02:15:56,950 --> 02:15:58,111
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for asking that question.

757
02:16:02,929 --> 02:16:08,915
[SPEAKER_10]: So while we're talking about waitlists, and like I said, it's only for new students.

758
02:16:08,975 --> 02:16:11,577
[SPEAKER_10]: The lottery is only for new students who are not currently enrolled.

759
02:16:12,038 --> 02:16:22,027
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyone who's currently on a waitlist does not have to enter the lottery on April 1st, because their waitlist currently, where they are on the waitlist will transfer till next year.

760
02:16:22,507 --> 02:16:26,191
[SPEAKER_10]: They move year to year and they stay right where they are and just move up.

761
02:16:27,216 --> 02:16:38,987
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm gonna take this opportunity to take a break in the presentation to ask, to offer a proposal, something that we've talked about in many different circles about possibly changing that format for the wait list.

762
02:16:39,027 --> 02:16:39,968
[SPEAKER_10]: I wanna run this by you.

763
02:16:40,848 --> 02:16:45,492
[SPEAKER_10]: Instead of a ranked list where students, I'll run it by the lottery.

764
02:16:45,753 --> 02:16:46,714
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll give me a list.

765
02:16:47,194 --> 02:16:52,319
[SPEAKER_10]: The top people on that list get the open spots and everybody else is put on the wait list in that order.

766
02:16:53,624 --> 02:16:58,908
[SPEAKER_10]: anybody added to the wait list, instead of calling it a list, it'll be like they stay in the lottery.

767
02:16:59,529 --> 02:17:02,251
[SPEAKER_10]: So they'll be put in their grade group.

768
02:17:03,692 --> 02:17:11,558
[SPEAKER_10]: But as soon as a spot opens up, I'll run that lottery for the students who are in the wait list through the lottery generator.

769
02:17:11,578 --> 02:17:13,599
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, the generator again.

770
02:17:13,859 --> 02:17:16,661
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's as though they have a fresh chance every time.

771
02:17:19,773 --> 02:17:20,934
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure this will have questions.

772
02:17:21,294 --> 02:17:26,897
[SPEAKER_10]: So we can either take a break and take questions now, or I could save, I can go through the rest of the presentation.

773
02:17:26,917 --> 02:17:28,317
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll do questions about that at the end.

774
02:17:28,958 --> 02:17:29,958
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's, that sounds good.

775
02:17:30,358 --> 02:17:30,578
Okay.

776
02:17:32,379 --> 02:17:34,300
[SPEAKER_04]: So let that jumble and come up with your questions.

777
02:17:35,961 --> 02:17:40,724
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to let that digest in my head because people at the bottom of the list would love that plan.

778
02:17:40,784 --> 02:17:44,365
[SPEAKER_04]: People that have been waiting for years that are at the top of the list would hate that plan.

779
02:17:44,465 --> 02:17:44,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

780
02:17:44,726 --> 02:17:45,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Ruseau.

781
02:17:46,621 --> 02:17:51,242
[SPEAKER_14]: So the change, though, is not for anybody currently on a wait list.

782
02:17:51,302 --> 02:17:53,203
[SPEAKER_14]: It would just be the new kindergartners.

783
02:17:53,463 --> 02:17:54,243
[SPEAKER_10]: We could talk about that.

784
02:17:54,283 --> 02:17:54,903
[SPEAKER_10]: We could decide.

785
02:17:54,983 --> 02:17:55,163
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.

786
02:17:55,383 --> 02:17:55,603
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

787
02:17:55,623 --> 02:17:57,904
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, if that could be the recommendation.

788
02:17:58,164 --> 02:18:15,268
[SPEAKER_14]: So my understanding of some of the problem with a wait list, everybody gets a number when we do the lottery, is that if you're number one on the wait list, well, that

789
02:18:17,031 --> 02:18:20,313
[SPEAKER_14]: means something different than if you're number 142 on the wait list.

790
02:18:22,514 --> 02:18:24,195
[SPEAKER_14]: At least it does to the parent.

791
02:18:25,456 --> 02:18:37,724
[SPEAKER_14]: In reality, I mean, if I was a parent and I was number one on the wait list, I would make decisions very differently than if I was number 107, I'm sorry, 107 at the Brooks wait list.

792
02:18:38,264 --> 02:18:39,905
[SPEAKER_14]: I would not behave the same.

793
02:18:40,805 --> 02:18:43,426
[SPEAKER_14]: I would be like, somebody's gonna leave.

794
02:18:43,486 --> 02:18:45,547
[SPEAKER_14]: Somebody's gonna, something's gonna happen.

795
02:18:45,647 --> 02:18:46,648
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm gonna get a spot.

796
02:18:46,808 --> 02:18:51,950
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not going to find additional, I'm not gonna be looking for another option.

797
02:18:53,911 --> 02:18:58,473
[SPEAKER_14]: And if I'm number one, it doesn't feel terribly risky.

798
02:18:58,493 --> 02:19:00,573
[SPEAKER_14]: If I'm number three, it's sort of as a risk.

799
02:19:00,954 --> 02:19:03,435
[SPEAKER_14]: And as you move down the list, it becomes pointless.

800
02:19:03,815 --> 02:19:04,295
[SPEAKER_14]: If you're number 107,

801
02:19:06,977 --> 02:19:11,801
[SPEAKER_14]: to say it's risky to just wait for a spot is an understatement.

802
02:19:13,363 --> 02:19:17,386
[SPEAKER_14]: The problem is being number one on the wait list does not mean you're next.

803
02:19:18,767 --> 02:19:24,472
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that that is an impossible logical thing for most families to comprehend.

804
02:19:25,053 --> 02:19:28,536
[SPEAKER_14]: Being number one on the wait list does not mean you get the next spot.

805
02:19:29,397 --> 02:19:34,021
[SPEAKER_14]: So if a kindergartner is doing two days a week,

806
02:19:36,039 --> 02:19:46,566
[SPEAKER_14]: And they move and now it opens up and the next person needs five days a week or three days a week or two days a week, but a different two days a week.

807
02:19:47,066 --> 02:19:48,567
[SPEAKER_14]: Those two days cannot work.

808
02:19:49,968 --> 02:19:51,048
[SPEAKER_14]: They're number one on the list.

809
02:19:51,408 --> 02:19:52,309
[SPEAKER_14]: They don't get a spot.

810
02:19:53,490 --> 02:20:02,635
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think this is too complicated, frankly, for even when we've had this conversation before and I have to like, am I saying it correctly?

811
02:20:02,695 --> 02:20:03,896
[SPEAKER_14]: Because it is complicated.

812
02:20:04,597 --> 02:20:15,525
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think it's unfair for people who are number one, two, three, four, five to be put in a position of- False hope.

813
02:20:15,585 --> 02:20:16,305
[SPEAKER_14]: What do you do?

814
02:20:16,546 --> 02:20:17,806
[SPEAKER_14]: False hope.

815
02:20:17,866 --> 02:20:28,994
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like, do you have to communicate with you at least 72 times over the summer in hopes that number one will, you'll go from number one to having a seat.

816
02:20:31,116 --> 02:20:34,158
[SPEAKER_14]: It feels like it sets a situation up where

817
02:20:35,100 --> 02:20:41,341
[SPEAKER_14]: you look, not you personally, but the program looks bad and it gives false hope.

818
02:20:42,422 --> 02:20:48,383
[SPEAKER_14]: And so that's sort of my big problem with this list.

819
02:20:49,723 --> 02:21:02,666
[SPEAKER_14]: I also think that we've talked about who's in the list, meaning are there people who aren't even applying because they know we have

820
02:21:03,857 --> 02:21:05,218
[SPEAKER_14]: not anywhere near enough spots.

821
02:21:05,478 --> 02:21:10,743
[SPEAKER_14]: And my mind, we wanna know how big is the actual demand.

822
02:21:10,843 --> 02:21:13,085
[SPEAKER_14]: And we do not know the actual demand right now.

823
02:21:14,406 --> 02:21:21,893
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, at the Brooks, if you take all of the kids that are in the program and everybody that's on the wait list, that's like half the student body.

824
02:21:22,754 --> 02:21:25,516
[SPEAKER_14]: But the other schools, it's not anywhere near that.

825
02:21:26,297 --> 02:21:29,560
[SPEAKER_14]: And without knowing the demand,

826
02:21:30,416 --> 02:21:31,797
[SPEAKER_14]: it's really hard to make decisions.

827
02:21:31,817 --> 02:21:44,141
[SPEAKER_14]: I think if everybody was, we picked the top, the kids that are getting a spot and everybody else gets to sit in the pile, well, then there's this like, it could be my turn.

828
02:21:44,781 --> 02:21:58,586
[SPEAKER_14]: And it would feel like I would wanna throw my name in the hat and maybe get a much cheaper program than I'm gonna get at a private provider, which is really a different conversation we'll have later in the slide deck.

829
02:22:00,692 --> 02:22:05,776
[SPEAKER_14]: I just think that, and correct me if I'm wrong, but other districts do not do wait lists.

830
02:22:05,896 --> 02:22:08,679
[SPEAKER_14]: They do a lottery every time a spot opens up.

831
02:22:09,980 --> 02:22:10,440
[SPEAKER_10]: That's correct.

832
02:22:10,520 --> 02:22:12,742
[SPEAKER_10]: There are several districts that don't do wait lists at all.

833
02:22:13,723 --> 02:22:20,428
[SPEAKER_10]: There are some that have finite wait lists that they'll take a wait list of five students and then they turn off the wait list.

834
02:22:23,210 --> 02:22:24,611
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's a possibility.

835
02:22:26,261 --> 02:22:30,082
[SPEAKER_10]: a waitlist as long as I've been asked to, because I'm like you, I'm curious.

836
02:22:30,122 --> 02:22:32,002
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to know what the actual demand is.

837
02:22:32,062 --> 02:22:34,483
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like to know the true data about it.

838
02:22:35,183 --> 02:22:38,684
[SPEAKER_10]: But to your point, there are several families that I've never heard from.

839
02:22:38,764 --> 02:22:42,785
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't know that they don't need it just because they're not on my waitlist.

840
02:22:43,485 --> 02:22:52,727
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't know that some of the people on my waitlist actually do need it, or they're just thinking, you know, I'd rather my child hang out with friends at school instead of come home.

841
02:22:54,133 --> 02:23:01,336
[SPEAKER_10]: to just me, so they don't necessarily need childcare, but they want socialization and all the other benefits that afterschool programs have.

842
02:23:01,836 --> 02:23:08,539
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's not completely accurate data, but I keep the long wait lists for that reason.

843
02:23:09,279 --> 02:23:19,163
[SPEAKER_14]: So if we did away with the wait list, the lottery situation right now is we run it, we create the wait list,

844
02:23:20,413 --> 02:23:27,237
[SPEAKER_14]: And then I moved to Medford or I hear about this system after the date of the wait list gets generated now.

845
02:23:27,878 --> 02:23:33,101
[SPEAKER_14]: And I would know to not apply because there's 107 kids on the wait list.

846
02:23:33,301 --> 02:23:34,502
[SPEAKER_14]: I will be number 108.

847
02:23:35,202 --> 02:23:38,865
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not filling out a damn form so I can be number 108 on the wait list.

848
02:23:38,925 --> 02:23:40,926
[SPEAKER_14]: That's not how I like to use my time.

849
02:23:42,187 --> 02:23:48,611
[SPEAKER_14]: But if we get rid of the wait list, I find out about this after the selection has happened.

850
02:23:49,342 --> 02:23:51,705
[SPEAKER_14]: I move to Medford after the selection has happened.

851
02:23:52,006 --> 02:24:05,922
[SPEAKER_14]: I fill out the form in June, July, August, September, any time I get added into the pile, and I have the same opportunity as anybody else to get picked the next time a spot opens.

852
02:24:06,022 --> 02:24:08,986
[SPEAKER_14]: And that feels particularly fair to me because

853
02:24:11,414 --> 02:24:20,722
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I mean, communications isn't our biggest strength, but even if it was our biggest strength, there will always be people moving into the community or people who are just completely unaware.

854
02:24:20,742 --> 02:24:26,827
[SPEAKER_14]: And it doesn't feel like, well, frankly, always knowing what's going on is a very privileged position.

855
02:24:27,647 --> 02:24:37,676
[SPEAKER_14]: And so for people that do not have that privilege to also lose the opportunities that we offer just seems like a double whammy.

856
02:24:39,870 --> 02:25:01,257
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll wait for my motion because I realize that other people have something to say, but it feels a lot fairer to me, both to a parent that would know to not get this false hope, but also to all the people who don't know in time about this two-week period to have the same opportunities to use the services that we're providing.

857
02:25:01,617 --> 02:25:04,638
[SPEAKER_14]: And everybody should have those same opportunities, so thank you.

858
02:25:06,159 --> 02:25:06,419
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

859
02:25:06,519 --> 02:25:06,979
[SPEAKER_19]: Member Graham?

860
02:25:08,140 --> 02:25:08,460
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

861
02:25:10,528 --> 02:25:24,473
[SPEAKER_19]: I like where this proposal is going for a bunch of reasons, not the least of which is we, we get a lot of feedback about communication with the afterschool program, right?

862
02:25:24,513 --> 02:25:26,754
[SPEAKER_19]: We get lots of requests for data.

863
02:25:26,774 --> 02:25:29,355
[SPEAKER_19]: We get, we have lots of really interested parents.

864
02:25:30,195 --> 02:25:37,238
[SPEAKER_19]: And one of the things I hear from parents when they're frustrated is with the best of intention, you're trying to set expectations.

865
02:25:37,697 --> 02:25:39,817
[SPEAKER_19]: and it's received really, really badly.

866
02:25:40,258 --> 02:25:43,818
[SPEAKER_19]: And so suddenly you are the actual problem, right?

867
02:25:43,878 --> 02:25:49,300
[SPEAKER_19]: Because you have said you're 107 on the wait list, like you should make other arrangements, right?

868
02:25:49,340 --> 02:26:00,042
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think that's true, accurate and factual, but it's putting you in a position to constantly be peppered with questions about, am I getting closer?

869
02:26:00,122 --> 02:26:00,922
[SPEAKER_19]: Am I getting closer?

870
02:26:00,982 --> 02:26:01,902
[SPEAKER_19]: Am I getting closer?

871
02:26:02,562 --> 02:26:04,703
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think that's,

872
02:26:06,846 --> 02:26:11,308
[SPEAKER_19]: intended to be a satisfying thing for people to know that progress is being made.

873
02:26:11,828 --> 02:26:14,869
[SPEAKER_19]: But I don't think it actually bears out that way at all.

874
02:26:15,250 --> 02:26:18,531
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it just constantly creates this frustration.

875
02:26:18,631 --> 02:26:29,015
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm hugely in favor of not pulling a wait list for all the reasons that Member Ruseau talked about and that we've talked about over a long period of time.

876
02:26:29,035 --> 02:26:31,836
[SPEAKER_19]: I would like us to think about

877
02:26:33,686 --> 02:26:38,549
[SPEAKER_19]: Today, if we're going to take a vote, being the line of marcation, right?

878
02:26:38,629 --> 02:26:44,532
[SPEAKER_19]: So if you are on the wait list today, you can stay on the list, right?

879
02:26:44,652 --> 02:26:46,753
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll process you in and through.

880
02:26:47,354 --> 02:26:50,535
[SPEAKER_19]: But I don't want to create a window.

881
02:26:51,906 --> 02:26:55,568
[SPEAKER_19]: for people to rush to sign up because then they get on the list.

882
02:26:56,328 --> 02:27:04,852
[SPEAKER_19]: And then the lottery like becomes this really hollow thing because so many people rush to get on the list that like the lottery can never actually happen.

883
02:27:04,872 --> 02:27:11,035
[SPEAKER_19]: And obviously with the kindergartners, like that's like the fresh start through to start setting that precedent.

884
02:27:11,095 --> 02:27:20,139
[SPEAKER_19]: But I think even for families who may have a first grader or a second grader, like I don't want to create a situation where

885
02:27:20,933 --> 02:27:29,955
[SPEAKER_19]: we're sort of inflating the number of people on the list because people perceive that that's the way to combat the fact that we're going to move to a lottery-based system.

886
02:27:32,275 --> 02:27:49,678
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think it probably makes sense to think through that as well and to provide some sort of line of demarcation that comes from us so that you don't have to be the arbiter of that decision or be in a position where you have to

887
02:27:50,182 --> 02:27:58,889
[SPEAKER_19]: be the like voice of disappointment again and again and again as we make this transition because these transitions are hard for people and I totally like understand and appreciate that.

888
02:28:00,851 --> 02:28:03,253
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think this has a lot of merit.

889
02:28:03,613 --> 02:28:12,441
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think when we talk about wanting to serve as many people as possible, I think that's it's great.

890
02:28:12,481 --> 02:28:15,263
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's something we should continue to work toward.

891
02:28:15,863 --> 02:28:16,424
[SPEAKER_19]: But I think

892
02:28:17,468 --> 02:28:23,693
[SPEAKER_19]: the process while we're not there has become a bit untenable for the district.

893
02:28:24,233 --> 02:28:34,961
[SPEAKER_19]: And my concern is that if it continues to get more and more and more untenable, that we will do what lots of districts do and just say, we can't do this anymore.

894
02:28:35,121 --> 02:28:40,345
[SPEAKER_19]: And we can't afford for that to happen in Medford because Medford doesn't have other options.

895
02:28:41,026 --> 02:28:43,848
[SPEAKER_19]: Lots of these other communities have lots of options and we do not.

896
02:28:43,968 --> 02:28:45,529
[SPEAKER_19]: So we can't create

897
02:28:46,047 --> 02:28:49,069
[SPEAKER_19]: an environment that continues to like set up this discontent.

898
02:28:49,809 --> 02:29:02,357
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, so I think people maybe be unhappy about this shift, but I would rather like sort of withstand that in the short term, then create a situation where a year from now you all are coming to us and saying, we can't do this anymore.

899
02:29:02,437 --> 02:29:03,798
[SPEAKER_19]: Like we can't make this work.

900
02:29:04,379 --> 02:29:04,879
[SPEAKER_19]: It is too much.

901
02:29:05,179 --> 02:29:07,100
[SPEAKER_19]: That is what I really want to try to avoid.

902
02:29:07,120 --> 02:29:11,443
[SPEAKER_19]: And so I do feel like we have to take some active measure to, to get us there.

903
02:29:11,523 --> 02:29:12,904
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm totally in favor of it.

904
02:29:13,410 --> 02:29:24,316
[SPEAKER_19]: I just would want to make sure that we're super clear about what it is, who gets to stay on the wait list, and who is subject to lottery when that happens.

905
02:29:27,078 --> 02:29:32,000
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, if somebody looks back a couple of slides, they'll notice that that was one of the things that I said.

906
02:29:32,060 --> 02:29:37,443
[SPEAKER_10]: Other districts have opted to not have a district-run program for reasons like this.

907
02:29:37,803 --> 02:29:40,305
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a real concern, especially in Medford.

908
02:29:42,887 --> 02:29:46,969
[SPEAKER_19]: Lots of communities face the same issue in their school-based programs.

909
02:29:47,789 --> 02:29:52,352
[SPEAKER_19]: Lots of other communities have lots of other options, and that is not something that we have here in Medford.

910
02:29:52,412 --> 02:29:53,012
[SPEAKER_19]: We just don't.

911
02:29:53,432 --> 02:30:03,317
[SPEAKER_10]: Although I did want to share the good news about, um, there is one new program coming to Medford and as promised, we're doing everything in our capacity to partner with them.

912
02:30:03,577 --> 02:30:05,698
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, so it's a program called Ready, Set, Kids.

913
02:30:06,038 --> 02:30:09,400
[SPEAKER_10]: And I believe some parents actually were instrumental in helping to sort of

914
02:30:10,494 --> 02:30:14,597
[SPEAKER_10]: them to the city and they'll be opening up in West Medford with a small program.

915
02:30:14,697 --> 02:30:19,460
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's something and it's an alternative to help us with the waitlist, number one.

916
02:30:19,560 --> 02:30:24,564
[SPEAKER_10]: And number two, as we've said before, an in-district at-school program is not perfect for every kid.

917
02:30:24,984 --> 02:30:33,370
[SPEAKER_10]: There are a lot of kids who need a change of scenery for whom staying in the same building for possibly 10 hours if they're in the before and after school program.

918
02:30:33,823 --> 02:30:34,824
[SPEAKER_10]: is really not ideal.

919
02:30:34,924 --> 02:30:38,085
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm delighted that there's another alternative opening up.

920
02:30:38,466 --> 02:30:39,326
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd love to see more.

921
02:30:39,566 --> 02:30:42,748
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, I will, the superintendent is committed to this.

922
02:30:42,788 --> 02:30:57,756
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll do anything that we can in partnership with them to help ease the transition, whether that's providing transportation from the elementary schools to those programs, or I invited her to join on the Medford Family Resource Council with the Medford Family Network so that we can all kind of work together and share resources.

923
02:30:57,836 --> 02:30:59,617
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're still committed to that.

924
02:30:59,737 --> 02:31:01,698
[SPEAKER_10]: So as far as, thank you.

925
02:31:03,188 --> 02:31:05,871
[SPEAKER_10]: Any other questions on the lottery until we get to it?

926
02:31:05,891 --> 02:31:08,635
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you want to wait for my motion to the end?

927
02:31:10,597 --> 02:31:12,059
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you want to make my motion now?

928
02:31:14,982 --> 02:31:15,643
[SPEAKER_07]: Let us process.

929
02:31:15,663 --> 02:31:17,205
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll do all motions at the end if you can.

930
02:31:17,385 --> 02:31:17,586
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks.

931
02:31:21,499 --> 02:31:29,884
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so now I've given you sort of the state of the program and who the students are and where we are with the students, but now I'd like to talk to you about the budget of the program.

932
02:31:30,284 --> 02:31:36,088
[SPEAKER_10]: As a reminder, and to people who are watching who don't know about this, the district-run program is fully self-supported.

933
02:31:36,208 --> 02:31:45,253
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a revolving account for people who know that parlance, but it's the outgoing money for costs is supported by the incoming money from tuition.

934
02:31:45,754 --> 02:31:49,016
[SPEAKER_10]: So with that in mind, I have some presentations on the budgets.

935
02:31:49,316 --> 02:31:52,158
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is my projection for next year.

936
02:31:53,799 --> 02:32:03,064
[SPEAKER_10]: Total personnel costs, and that's counting those at the school personnel that I mentioned, the site coordinators, group leaders, assistant group leaders, and high school aides.

937
02:32:04,878 --> 02:32:22,098
[SPEAKER_10]: And then supplies and this is for our crafts and our games and we share with the schools, a little bit, but we try not to because we understand that those are sort of belong to the phys ed teacher belong to the art teacher so we like to have our own supplies and that way if we wreck something we're not feeling guilty about it the next day so.

938
02:32:22,591 --> 02:32:24,852
[SPEAKER_10]: supplies, miscellaneous expenses.

939
02:32:24,952 --> 02:32:31,556
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, at every school, we have cell phones for emergencies and for dismissals and administrative personnel.

940
02:32:31,576 --> 02:32:36,959
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is for me, my salary comes out of this revolving account and my administrative assistant.

941
02:32:37,259 --> 02:32:45,403
[SPEAKER_10]: And then you'll recall school committee members that as part of the budget, I believe last year, we talked about including the wraparound paraprofessionals.

942
02:32:46,644 --> 02:32:58,910
[SPEAKER_10]: and wrap around, this was suggested by you, this has been suggested by our superintendent, I think we're finally gonna make it happen with the paraprofessionals union, that we're gonna have a paraprofessional position that is from 11 to five.

943
02:32:59,410 --> 02:33:06,313
[SPEAKER_10]: So they support the school for the second half of the school day, but then stay to support the afterschool programs for the afternoon.

944
02:33:07,216 --> 02:33:22,116
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think this is instrumental because these are people who are in the building and know the school, they know the students, they can come to the after school program having, you know, been a part of the tenor of the day, they can say there was some incident that might make some kids agitated and they bring this information to the after school.

945
02:33:22,745 --> 02:33:25,307
[SPEAKER_10]: and they work those lucrative hours.

946
02:33:25,808 --> 02:33:32,333
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's money allotted that has never been allotted from the afterschool budget before for those paraprofessionals.

947
02:33:32,473 --> 02:33:33,735
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the new cost.

948
02:33:34,135 --> 02:33:38,318
[SPEAKER_10]: Another new cost is the Office of Family and Community Engagement Program Manager.

949
02:33:38,378 --> 02:33:44,884
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is a woman who she works partly to support the before and afterschool programs and partly for the Medford Family Network.

950
02:33:45,344 --> 02:33:47,706
[SPEAKER_10]: And she's really helping in the Medford Family Network

951
02:33:48,956 --> 02:33:50,597
[SPEAKER_10]: with grants and grant reporting.

952
02:33:51,158 --> 02:33:58,023
[SPEAKER_10]: And she's gonna be doing some funding searching for lots of different programs in the family engagement offices.

953
02:33:58,223 --> 02:34:03,447
[SPEAKER_10]: So she'll be looking for more funding for Medford Family Network as well as professional development and funding for the afterschool programs.

954
02:34:04,047 --> 02:34:05,509
[SPEAKER_10]: So some of her salary comes from there too.

955
02:34:05,829 --> 02:34:06,049
[SPEAKER_14]: Mayor.

956
02:34:08,231 --> 02:34:08,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Russell.

957
02:34:11,053 --> 02:34:14,455
[SPEAKER_14]: Just to point out that when we look at a budget like this,

958
02:34:16,087 --> 02:34:22,111
[SPEAKER_14]: there's a gigantic line item that does not exist that would exist in any private program.

959
02:34:23,852 --> 02:34:31,236
[SPEAKER_14]: And that is we, the program pays exactly $0 for the building, $0 for heat, $0 for electricity.

960
02:34:32,397 --> 02:34:38,840
[SPEAKER_14]: These are incredibly expensive that the district provides and are free to the program.

961
02:34:38,881 --> 02:34:42,923
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's fine, but I think it's important to consider when we talk about how

962
02:34:44,191 --> 02:34:48,855
[SPEAKER_14]: On the next slide, you'll see that there's more income than going out.

963
02:34:50,156 --> 02:35:06,928
[SPEAKER_14]: But it is, in my mind, not a reflection of just like a cash cow, like to have these programs in a facility where you are paying rent and you are paying your own utilities would far outstrip the deferential.

964
02:35:07,909 --> 02:35:11,872
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just think that's really important when looking at this budget to recognize that,

965
02:35:13,493 --> 02:35:19,334
[SPEAKER_14]: that the excess cash is not just, it's not play money.

966
02:35:19,574 --> 02:35:24,275
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like, we're providing something as a district, the taxpayers are.

967
02:35:24,935 --> 02:35:31,756
[SPEAKER_14]: And so it is, in my mind, very appropriate and rational that that is essentially coming back.

968
02:35:33,217 --> 02:35:35,697
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll let you get to your next slide where you'll see that, but thank you.

969
02:35:35,737 --> 02:35:39,538
[SPEAKER_10]: No, that's a great point, because in addition to utilities and custodial,

970
02:35:40,987 --> 02:35:45,950
[SPEAKER_10]: services, we have payroll services, we have lots of, you're right, lots of work that is done.

971
02:35:45,970 --> 02:35:47,411
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a great idea.

972
02:35:47,431 --> 02:35:51,794
[SPEAKER_10]: I should include a kind of in-kind line in there next time I do this, I will.

973
02:35:52,694 --> 02:36:01,760
[SPEAKER_10]: Because that is, it's appreciated and it's extensive, especially because I have so many people coming in and out of the before or the after school

974
02:36:02,546 --> 02:36:03,667
[SPEAKER_10]: service throughout the year.

975
02:36:03,767 --> 02:36:13,437
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm constantly in the human resources office like, Hey, I have another new person, you know, for two days a week, but you still have to do the same amount of work that you would do for a salaried person who works every day.

976
02:36:13,517 --> 02:36:15,760
[SPEAKER_10]: So that is, that's definitely worth noting.

977
02:36:15,780 --> 02:36:17,982
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

978
02:36:19,263 --> 02:36:24,969
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is our anticipated income, especially depending on, you know,

979
02:36:25,848 --> 02:36:27,352
[SPEAKER_10]: conversations we have a couple slides later.

980
02:36:27,813 --> 02:36:34,408
[SPEAKER_10]: But so we are fortunate to have for the last several years received a grant from the city from the community to

981
02:36:34,707 --> 02:36:36,327
[SPEAKER_10]: community development block grant.

982
02:36:37,768 --> 02:36:43,228
[SPEAKER_10]: They have different grants that meet the needs of residents who qualify for as low income residents.

983
02:36:43,369 --> 02:36:46,509
[SPEAKER_10]: And so we've qualified for tuition subsidies for our students.

984
02:36:47,069 --> 02:36:50,350
[SPEAKER_10]: Last year, their funding, the city's funding was cut.

985
02:36:50,510 --> 02:36:56,111
[SPEAKER_10]: So all of their grantees funding was cut a little bit, but typically we've enjoyed $10,000 a year.

986
02:36:56,671 --> 02:37:02,112
[SPEAKER_10]: So we see no reason, fingers crossed, that we won't get that full 10,000.

987
02:37:02,352 --> 02:37:03,512
[SPEAKER_10]: Hopefully it'll be back up.

988
02:37:04,060 --> 02:37:08,841
[SPEAKER_10]: for next year to subsidize and, but otherwise we'll have the income from the tuitions.

989
02:37:12,342 --> 02:37:18,864
[SPEAKER_10]: It's important to note that we, we have to keep this, this is a revolving account and all of our expenses come from the tuitions.

990
02:37:18,984 --> 02:37:24,325
[SPEAKER_10]: So we need to keep this healthy and keep on top of it and make sure that we're, you know, always in the black.

991
02:37:26,570 --> 02:37:33,895
[SPEAKER_10]: So the proposal that I have for, I did after school first, because this is one that we ask for every year.

992
02:37:34,315 --> 02:37:37,797
[SPEAKER_10]: Historically, we've asked for only two to 3% increases.

993
02:37:38,238 --> 02:37:44,321
[SPEAKER_10]: And that was in line with what the state increased for what they would reimburse us for vouchers.

994
02:37:44,702 --> 02:37:51,586
[SPEAKER_10]: So you'll recall last year was the, we stopped taking vouchers from the state because for several reasons.

995
02:37:52,046 --> 02:37:55,989
[SPEAKER_10]: And this year we are doing financial assistance on our own sliding scale.

996
02:37:57,532 --> 02:38:08,399
[SPEAKER_10]: But because it's our own sliding scale and we're not reliant on reimbursement from the state, we don't necessarily have to follow what their reimbursement minimums or maximums rather are.

997
02:38:09,439 --> 02:38:14,482
[SPEAKER_10]: So this year, I'm proposing going up just a little bit more than 3%, the 3%.

998
02:38:14,602 --> 02:38:15,863
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's to get us closer to

999
02:38:20,199 --> 02:38:26,901
[SPEAKER_10]: closer to the middle top of where other districts are to help us cover our costs that we're anticipating for next year.

1000
02:38:27,462 --> 02:38:31,383
[SPEAKER_10]: And the biggest cost that I'll talk about in a minute is pay rates to the staff.

1001
02:38:32,363 --> 02:38:35,525
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'd like you to consider that.

1002
02:38:36,145 --> 02:38:38,706
[SPEAKER_10]: So look at, you'll have those numbers for the afterschool tuition.

1003
02:38:38,866 --> 02:38:44,508
[SPEAKER_10]: And then again, before school tuition, as I've said, has not changed in several years.

1004
02:38:44,648 --> 02:38:47,809
[SPEAKER_10]: Certainly not since I've been working as the before and after school,

1005
02:38:50,452 --> 02:38:51,253
[SPEAKER_10]: which has been five years.

1006
02:38:51,393 --> 02:38:56,836
[SPEAKER_10]: So I propose raising that to an even $10 an hour.

1007
02:38:56,856 --> 02:38:59,998
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's the next one.

1008
02:39:00,959 --> 02:39:01,139
Yeah.

1009
02:39:04,121 --> 02:39:09,285
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, are there, before I go on to pay rates, are there any questions that jump out?

1010
02:39:09,325 --> 02:39:09,905
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, keep going.

1011
02:39:10,085 --> 02:39:10,526
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, sorry.

1012
02:39:10,926 --> 02:39:16,169
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so pay rates, again, I outlined all the different positions that we have in the afterschool program.

1013
02:39:18,194 --> 02:39:26,420
[SPEAKER_10]: So I've struggled with retention of staff for years since I've worked in afterschool, which was five years here and before that in a different district.

1014
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:34,826
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's a tricky time of day to hire for, but also we have to compensate well.

1015
02:39:34,906 --> 02:39:38,188
[SPEAKER_10]: We have to understand that they are planning for these students.

1016
02:39:38,228 --> 02:39:38,969
[SPEAKER_10]: They're keeping them safe.

1017
02:39:39,009 --> 02:39:39,629
[SPEAKER_10]: They are the nurse.

1018
02:39:39,690 --> 02:39:40,710
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no nurse on staff.

1019
02:39:40,750 --> 02:39:41,431
[SPEAKER_10]: They're the parents.

1020
02:39:41,511 --> 02:39:44,453
[SPEAKER_10]: They're the communication with the parents.

1021
02:39:44,493 --> 02:39:47,275
[SPEAKER_10]: They're often delivering messages from the school when parents pick up.

1022
02:39:47,677 --> 02:39:51,280
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's really imperative that we right size their paychecks.

1023
02:39:51,520 --> 02:39:52,742
[SPEAKER_10]: And I feel like they've been.

1024
02:39:54,214 --> 02:39:56,876
[SPEAKER_10]: Underpaid, I think we did a big service to them two years ago.

1025
02:39:56,936 --> 02:40:02,000
[SPEAKER_10]: We gave them a significant pay rate that was fantastic, and we were ahead in Massachusetts.

1026
02:40:02,980 --> 02:40:04,261
[SPEAKER_10]: But then everybody did what we did.

1027
02:40:04,361 --> 02:40:05,762
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody said, wow, look at Medford.

1028
02:40:06,123 --> 02:40:07,404
[SPEAKER_10]: They've got something going.

1029
02:40:08,024 --> 02:40:09,365
[SPEAKER_10]: And so everybody has risen to us.

1030
02:40:09,405 --> 02:40:11,967
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're no longer in the lead for our pay rates.

1031
02:40:12,448 --> 02:40:13,428
[SPEAKER_10]: We are right in the middle.

1032
02:40:14,169 --> 02:40:23,436
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'd just like to propose right-sizing our pay for site coordinators and group leaders, which is where we were sort of dipping.

1033
02:40:27,228 --> 02:40:33,371
[SPEAKER_19]: I just also want to point out that I don't think the takeaway should be that we raised our rates so everybody else did too.

1034
02:40:33,431 --> 02:40:45,237
[SPEAKER_19]: There's an entire economic set of factors at play that make jobs like this a completely different animal today than they were two years ago or three years ago.

1035
02:40:47,178 --> 02:40:51,120
[SPEAKER_19]: And so if we want to compete in the economic reality, like we

1036
02:40:52,762 --> 02:41:00,849
[SPEAKER_19]: I think we did the right thing two years ago and what you're proposing here is the right thing in the right now because wages don't go down.

1037
02:41:00,869 --> 02:41:03,011
[SPEAKER_19]: That just really doesn't happen.

1038
02:41:03,171 --> 02:41:10,498
[SPEAKER_19]: So if we don't do this, I think we're going to be able to service even fewer kids next year because we will have fewer staff.

1039
02:41:10,718 --> 02:41:14,862
[SPEAKER_19]: So we need to make sure that we're prioritizing serving as many kids as we possibly can.

1040
02:41:16,063 --> 02:41:17,064
[SPEAKER_04]: And if I may, from the chair,

1041
02:41:17,958 --> 02:41:24,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Your slide for budgeted estimates for 2023-2024, does that take into account us approving?

1042
02:41:25,140 --> 02:41:27,240
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I was being very optimistic.

1043
02:41:28,461 --> 02:41:30,981
[SPEAKER_10]: I wondered if maybe that slide should have been in different order.

1044
02:41:32,142 --> 02:41:35,622
[SPEAKER_04]: So the revenue would be, okay, the 1.5.

1045
02:41:36,142 --> 02:41:44,965
[SPEAKER_04]: If we approve the increases in the rates and the estimates for the budget, that's as if we approved the pay increases.

1046
02:41:45,425 --> 02:41:46,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, thank you.

1047
02:41:49,491 --> 02:41:50,892
[SPEAKER_14]: So, thank you.

1048
02:41:51,352 --> 02:41:57,874
[SPEAKER_14]: I know I might be a little bit out of step on this from other people, and that's why there's a committee and not just one person in charge.

1049
02:41:58,875 --> 02:42:08,178
[SPEAKER_14]: But, you know, what's, you know, we live in a end stage capitalist society.

1050
02:42:08,198 --> 02:42:13,480
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's really not a, that's not a controversial statement.

1051
02:42:15,161 --> 02:42:15,801
[SPEAKER_14]: And the

1052
02:42:16,863 --> 02:42:32,051
[SPEAKER_14]: private companies, nationwide private companies providing these services are paying dramatically more than we will ever pay and charging families, you know, $40,000 a year.

1053
02:42:34,172 --> 02:42:46,438
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, this program is in a weird space where it is not public, not private, but also somehow competing with

1054
02:42:47,432 --> 02:42:47,852
[SPEAKER_14]: private.

1055
02:42:49,033 --> 02:42:58,816
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't, you know, I look at these wages and I see none of these wages making somebody leave another job to take these jobs.

1056
02:42:59,297 --> 02:43:05,239
[SPEAKER_14]: I just can't fathom anyone leaving any job at any pay to take these jobs.

1057
02:43:05,859 --> 02:43:15,803
[SPEAKER_14]: So if our goal is competition for workers, which, you know, it's like been front page news for three years now that everybody left the workforce.

1058
02:43:16,636 --> 02:43:20,559
[SPEAKER_14]: not everybody, but a lot of people, and they're not coming back.

1059
02:43:21,420 --> 02:43:26,243
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, in my mind, we have to get workers that already have jobs elsewhere.

1060
02:43:27,124 --> 02:43:28,745
[SPEAKER_14]: That's how you get your workers.

1061
02:43:28,785 --> 02:43:30,466
[SPEAKER_14]: That's how every private business does it.

1062
02:43:32,488 --> 02:43:35,530
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, just wishing that they're gonna show up.

1063
02:43:36,371 --> 02:43:44,156
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know how that, I'm not saying you're doing it, but just wishing that they're gonna appear to me seems,

1064
02:43:47,532 --> 02:43:48,652
[SPEAKER_14]: fantastical, really.

1065
02:43:49,813 --> 02:43:56,754
[SPEAKER_14]: And I know that, you know, I've talked before with you one on one, like, you know, we go to $100 an hour, do we get a bunch of workers?

1066
02:43:56,814 --> 02:43:57,114
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1067
02:43:57,194 --> 02:44:00,995
[SPEAKER_14]: And then two years later, every other district has $100 an hour jobs.

1068
02:44:01,456 --> 02:44:03,556
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's the same size workforce.

1069
02:44:04,596 --> 02:44:09,158
[SPEAKER_14]: But at some point, we do start peeling people off other types of employment.

1070
02:44:10,678 --> 02:44:10,778
[SPEAKER_14]: And

1071
02:44:11,420 --> 02:44:21,205
[SPEAKER_14]: And in my mind, until we start peeling people away from other employment types, we're just sort of running in a circle here.

1072
02:44:22,386 --> 02:44:25,728
[SPEAKER_14]: At best, we're going to keep up, and it's not going to fall further behind.

1073
02:44:25,888 --> 02:44:31,010
[SPEAKER_14]: But I don't really envision us somehow producing more employees.

1074
02:44:31,591 --> 02:44:33,232
[SPEAKER_14]: That just is not an option.

1075
02:44:33,632 --> 02:44:39,035
[SPEAKER_14]: So I look at these wages, and I say, OK, these are not 40 hour

1076
02:44:40,160 --> 02:44:41,260
[SPEAKER_14]: a week jobs.

1077
02:44:42,221 --> 02:45:09,731
[SPEAKER_14]: So unless you are independently wealthy or living at home and don't wanna work a full-time job, or, I mean, I'm incredibly grateful for every single person that does work for us in this program, but there is, I mean, without knowing any of them, well, I know a couple of them, I'm assuming none of them are paying for rent or a mortgage in Medford on these wages.

1078
02:45:10,862 --> 02:45:15,864
[SPEAKER_14]: they're probably not even able to eat on top of all the other stuff.

1079
02:45:16,164 --> 02:45:25,128
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just think that as a public body trying to provide a public service, reality has to come into the room a little bit here.

1080
02:45:26,849 --> 02:45:33,392
[SPEAKER_14]: And while some of these, I mean, $36 an hour, I mean, that's not nothing.

1081
02:45:34,353 --> 02:45:37,574
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it's important to point out too that those guys only work 26 hours a week.

1082
02:45:38,254 --> 02:45:39,255
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's not, to your point,

1083
02:45:40,046 --> 02:45:40,907
[SPEAKER_10]: point that should be clear.

1084
02:45:41,027 --> 02:45:43,809
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not a 48 for, you know, for 40 hours of work.

1085
02:45:44,089 --> 02:45:44,289
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

1086
02:45:44,650 --> 02:45:49,433
[SPEAKER_14]: So, um, I mean, I look at those increases and I'm just like, why not more?

1087
02:45:50,374 --> 02:46:06,527
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, and you know, when we talk about the sliding scale, you know, I'm not sure I've talked about this with you or not, but you know, when we did the superintendent search, we asked for incomes of people filling out the survey and I will never forget the results.

1088
02:46:07,387 --> 02:46:08,268
[SPEAKER_14]: And I understand that

1089
02:46:08,621 --> 02:46:21,665
[SPEAKER_14]: it's not a generalization of the city of Medford and what the incomes are, but by far the number one income level of the people that filled out the superintendent search were households with more than $250,000 in income.

1090
02:46:21,845 --> 02:46:23,086
[SPEAKER_14]: And this was five years ago.

1091
02:46:25,146 --> 02:46:37,050
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just really have an incredible problem with people who are residents, the people we serve, if they have incomes like that,

1092
02:46:37,773 --> 02:46:41,516
[SPEAKER_14]: paying these rates to me feels absolutely wrong.

1093
02:46:43,078 --> 02:46:43,858
[SPEAKER_14]: Absolutely wrong.

1094
02:46:44,579 --> 02:46:52,406
[SPEAKER_14]: And if they lived in places that don't have this, they'd be paying $40,000 a year for the same services, or they'd be getting a nanny.

1095
02:46:52,766 --> 02:46:57,531
[SPEAKER_14]: And I don't know what a nanny costs, but not what we're charging.

1096
02:46:58,071 --> 02:47:04,017
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm all for dramatically increasing these rates and then providing a steeper

1097
02:47:05,103 --> 02:47:08,504
[SPEAKER_14]: sliding scale so that we are not making anybody who can't afford it.

1098
02:47:09,245 --> 02:47:17,068
[SPEAKER_14]: Look, if your household income is 50,000 or 70,000, like you can't afford the high end of these rates probably.

1099
02:47:17,528 --> 02:47:19,369
[SPEAKER_14]: And I mean, I don't know what the scale looks like.

1100
02:47:19,689 --> 02:47:24,291
[SPEAKER_14]: So in my mind, we take the curve and we turn it up.

1101
02:47:26,172 --> 02:47:34,795
[SPEAKER_14]: And if some people whose household incomes are 400,000, $800,000 a year, and there are plenty of people in Medford where that's their household income,

1102
02:47:35,322 --> 02:47:43,686
[SPEAKER_14]: that are actually applying to be in these programs, let's not pretend that's not the case, they may go and say, I'll just get a nanny.

1103
02:47:44,587 --> 02:47:56,433
[SPEAKER_14]: And if we diminish demand, then the people that are on the present day waitlist future lottery pool have a greater chance of actually getting a spot.

1104
02:47:56,960 --> 02:48:01,182
[SPEAKER_14]: And those people are less likely and able to afford expensive options.

1105
02:48:01,882 --> 02:48:13,166
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I mean, I'm not looking to like, say, put an income cap, because if you're paying at the high end of the scale, you're supporting people at the bottom end of the scale.

1106
02:48:13,326 --> 02:48:14,367
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that's wonderful.

1107
02:48:14,407 --> 02:48:15,567
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's great.

1108
02:48:16,867 --> 02:48:22,229
[SPEAKER_14]: But I don't see this increase of 3% when inflation is through the roof.

1109
02:48:22,690 --> 02:48:25,911
[SPEAKER_14]: We're never going to buy a building in Medford to make a childcare center

1110
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:28,601
[SPEAKER_14]: less than many millions of dollars.

1111
02:48:30,841 --> 02:48:33,982
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know I just don't know why we are going a little bigger with this.

1112
02:48:35,183 --> 02:48:37,644
[SPEAKER_14]: That's that's my opinion on that.

1113
02:48:40,285 --> 02:48:43,206
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you miss look area think you have one more slide.

1114
02:48:45,386 --> 02:48:46,247
[SPEAKER_07]: But member Graham.

1115
02:48:52,409 --> 02:48:52,969
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll remember it.

1116
02:48:54,482 --> 02:48:54,902
[SPEAKER_19]: No problem.

1117
02:48:54,942 --> 02:48:55,502
[SPEAKER_10]: That happens.

1118
02:48:55,582 --> 02:48:56,223
[SPEAKER_10]: It's getting late.

1119
02:48:57,103 --> 02:48:58,723
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

1120
02:48:59,003 --> 02:48:59,704
[SPEAKER_10]: One slide left.

1121
02:49:00,584 --> 02:49:07,166
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's just to talk about, as I said, the before school pay rate, which again, has not been increased in at least the last five years.

1122
02:49:07,746 --> 02:49:11,427
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's again, just right sizing the pay rates.

1123
02:49:11,487 --> 02:49:12,868
[SPEAKER_10]: We have two positions.

1124
02:49:12,928 --> 02:49:13,968
[SPEAKER_10]: We call them in the before school.

1125
02:49:14,008 --> 02:49:14,828
[SPEAKER_10]: There's the lead teacher.

1126
02:49:14,868 --> 02:49:19,910
[SPEAKER_10]: They're the ones that are in charge of reaching out to all the families to tell them, you know, how the process works.

1127
02:49:19,950 --> 02:49:22,971
[SPEAKER_10]: They're in charge of getting payroll to me and then their support staff.

1128
02:49:23,031 --> 02:49:23,151
[SPEAKER_10]: So.

1129
02:49:23,712 --> 02:49:25,574
[SPEAKER_10]: These are the two different pay rates to increase them.

1130
02:49:26,334 --> 02:49:27,315
[SPEAKER_10]: Before I leave, I'd be remiss.

1131
02:49:27,355 --> 02:49:32,139
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to just give a shout out to thank all the site coordinators at the after-school programs, because they're amazing.

1132
02:49:32,399 --> 02:49:38,804
[SPEAKER_10]: Marissa Davis at the Brooks, Kathy Hunt at the McGlynn, Kathleen Keenan at the Roberts, and Jacqueline Salamone at the Mississauga are fantastic.

1133
02:49:39,465 --> 02:49:40,906
[SPEAKER_10]: And I want to publicly thank them.

1134
02:49:41,727 --> 02:49:42,667
[SPEAKER_10]: But thank you very much.

1135
02:49:42,727 --> 02:49:43,948
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all I've got.

1136
02:49:44,109 --> 02:49:46,911
[SPEAKER_10]: And now I'm ready for questions.

1137
02:49:47,091 --> 02:49:47,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1138
02:49:47,371 --> 02:49:48,912
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we have a few motions and questions.

1139
02:49:48,972 --> 02:49:49,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Graham?

1140
02:49:50,827 --> 02:50:00,295
[SPEAKER_19]: The new rates that you're proposing would not include any change to the sliding scale rate that we created last year.

1141
02:50:00,315 --> 02:50:00,735
[SPEAKER_10]: Correct.

1142
02:50:00,815 --> 02:50:06,760
[SPEAKER_10]: The sliding scale I used based on what the Community Development Grant Office uses to determine their low income.

1143
02:50:07,180 --> 02:50:08,101
[SPEAKER_10]: So I've used the same one.

1144
02:50:08,201 --> 02:50:09,842
[SPEAKER_19]: I meant the tuition rate.

1145
02:50:10,123 --> 02:50:19,610
[SPEAKER_19]: So what we created, so last year, right, we said if you qualify, you keep the rate from the prior year, and now everybody else sort of ticked up.

1146
02:50:20,222 --> 02:50:25,624
[SPEAKER_19]: and everyone else is gonna tick up again, is that rate flat or are you saying that's also going to tick up?

1147
02:50:26,904 --> 02:50:38,068
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I had thought that would tick up in the way that I was looking at it was everybody's percentage off or percent discount would be determined based on the full rate.

1148
02:50:40,549 --> 02:50:46,271
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'd be willing to entertain either option, the full rate and you can get either 20, 50 or 80% off.

1149
02:50:52,762 --> 02:50:54,323
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm now I'm getting the percentages wrong.

1150
02:50:55,084 --> 02:51:00,648
[SPEAKER_19]: So in other words, the way the program works is based on your income threshold, you get a percentage off.

1151
02:51:00,929 --> 02:51:01,149
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1152
02:51:01,449 --> 02:51:01,969
[SPEAKER_19]: Correct.

1153
02:51:02,170 --> 02:51:02,390
[SPEAKER_19]: Right.

1154
02:51:02,470 --> 02:51:17,902
[SPEAKER_19]: So if we do what member Rousseau is suggesting, and we make that rate much higher than those percent, that does make the program less affordable for those folks that are at that, at that, um, at those tiered levels, right?

1155
02:51:17,942 --> 02:51:18,603
[SPEAKER_19]: The sliding scale.

1156
02:51:19,901 --> 02:51:29,267
[SPEAKER_10]: It makes, I mean, if they're paying 20% now, it'll be 20%, right, of a bigger number and it'll still go up for them, yes.

1157
02:51:30,288 --> 02:51:38,493
[SPEAKER_19]: So I wondered, maybe I'll just try to like spit out a motion and you guys can tell me if you love it or hate it.

1158
02:51:39,113 --> 02:51:49,320
[SPEAKER_19]: Can I make a motion that you will investigate what the financials could look like to keep

1159
02:51:49,864 --> 02:52:07,131
[SPEAKER_19]: the sliding scale cost flat while providing an increase to the market rate that is bigger than what you've outlined here and bring that back to us.

1160
02:52:08,631 --> 02:52:09,692
[SPEAKER_19]: Does that make any sense at all?

1161
02:52:12,074 --> 02:52:12,914
[SPEAKER_10]: might need it repeated.

1162
02:52:12,954 --> 02:52:22,036
[SPEAKER_04]: How would it affect your bottom line if you kept this the sliding scale the same as the last two years for the low for the low income?

1163
02:52:22,376 --> 02:52:37,039
[SPEAKER_19]: So yeah in other words how could you keep the sliding scale like actual cost yep the same and what would a corresponding increase to the market rate need to be

1164
02:52:37,617 --> 02:52:41,959
[SPEAKER_19]: increase over and above what you have here in order for all of your financials to still work, right?

1165
02:52:42,059 --> 02:52:47,422
[SPEAKER_19]: Because your program has to be liquid in totality.

1166
02:52:47,482 --> 02:52:53,404
[SPEAKER_19]: So we can't like say yes to one thing and no to another thing without understanding, does it all work together?

1167
02:52:53,544 --> 02:52:58,907
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think my request is a slightly different cut at this that

1168
02:52:59,775 --> 02:53:06,016
[SPEAKER_19]: preserves the actual dollar cost for the sliding scale.

1169
02:53:06,456 --> 02:53:09,757
[SPEAKER_19]: And that might just mean changes to how the sliding scale works.

1170
02:53:10,017 --> 02:53:10,417
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know.

1171
02:53:11,577 --> 02:53:20,339
[SPEAKER_19]: But what would it take to offset and keep the program liquid all in, assuming the staff rates and all of that?

1172
02:53:20,359 --> 02:53:29,641
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't want us to make one-off decisions, because you can't operate the program if we make a series of one-off decisions that don't actually work together.

1173
02:53:30,763 --> 02:53:31,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, ma'am.

1174
02:53:32,645 --> 02:53:33,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Member McLaughlin.

1175
02:53:34,146 --> 02:53:34,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1176
02:53:34,766 --> 02:54:00,287
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I understand what member Graham is proposing is trying to be inclusive of economically disadvantaged families to keep them at a rate that would be reasonable for them to be able to access the program while also considering an increase in the rate for folks who are not

1177
02:54:01,420 --> 02:54:10,523
[SPEAKER_02]: economically disadvantaged to make it more market value so that we can therefore afford more of the things that we're talking about.

1178
02:54:10,903 --> 02:54:13,524
[SPEAKER_02]: But you just want to come back with that at this point.

1179
02:54:14,164 --> 02:54:15,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so I'll second that.

1180
02:54:15,704 --> 02:54:16,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you.

1181
02:54:17,865 --> 02:54:23,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, motion on the floor by Member Graham, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

1182
02:54:23,107 --> 02:54:25,528
[SPEAKER_14]: Would you like me to read it again?

1183
02:54:25,968 --> 02:54:26,148
No.

1184
02:54:26,628 --> 02:54:26,888
Okay.

1185
02:54:27,202 --> 02:54:36,307
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we all understand, and that's gonna, we're not gonna be able to vote specifically on any of the substance tonight, but we can put it on our next agenda once we get these answers.

1186
02:54:36,387 --> 02:54:37,868
[SPEAKER_04]: So, got it.

1187
02:54:39,989 --> 02:54:40,689
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

1188
02:54:41,290 --> 02:54:41,370
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

1189
02:54:41,550 --> 02:54:41,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

1190
02:54:42,010 --> 02:54:42,790
[SPEAKER_04]: All those opposed?

1191
02:54:43,211 --> 02:54:43,951
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

1192
02:54:44,051 --> 02:54:45,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for the presentation.

1193
02:54:45,472 --> 02:54:46,312
[SPEAKER_14]: Mayor, I have a motion.

1194
02:54:47,453 --> 02:54:48,253
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Ruseau?

1195
02:54:48,854 --> 02:54:56,518
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to make a motion that beginning with the 2023-2024 school year going forward, incoming kindergartners

1196
02:54:58,514 --> 02:55:04,616
[SPEAKER_14]: that we will change the wait list to an on-demand lottery, and that the lottery will remain open.

1197
02:55:06,756 --> 02:55:07,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Second.

1198
02:55:11,798 --> 02:55:12,578
[SPEAKER_07]: Member McLaughlin.

1199
02:55:15,799 --> 02:55:16,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you say that again?

1200
02:55:16,659 --> 02:55:17,679
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm tired, I think.

1201
02:55:17,779 --> 02:55:18,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

1202
02:55:18,380 --> 02:55:19,100
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll summarize it.

1203
02:55:19,200 --> 02:55:20,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, in a little different language.

1204
02:55:20,900 --> 02:55:21,040
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1205
02:55:21,280 --> 02:55:21,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1206
02:55:22,081 --> 02:55:27,082
[SPEAKER_14]: So the incoming kindergartners that are going to be in the lottery in April,

1207
02:55:28,413 --> 02:55:42,039
[SPEAKER_14]: that the lottery will happen, and that everybody who does not get picked will be left in the lottery, and that anybody who finds out about it later can just simply fill out the same application form.

1208
02:55:42,059 --> 02:55:44,180
[SPEAKER_14]: So there's really not an end date to the application.

1209
02:55:44,200 --> 02:55:45,641
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's no wait list.

1210
02:55:45,961 --> 02:55:46,801
[SPEAKER_14]: There's no wait list.

1211
02:55:46,821 --> 02:55:47,601
[SPEAKER_04]: That's correct.

1212
02:55:47,681 --> 02:55:50,603
[SPEAKER_04]: If there's an opening spot midway through the year, it would be a lottery.

1213
02:55:50,623 --> 02:55:51,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.

1214
02:55:53,654 --> 02:55:55,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion is already seconded.

1215
02:55:55,235 --> 02:55:57,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion on the floor by Member Ruseau, seconded by Member Graham.

1216
02:55:58,356 --> 02:55:59,116
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

1217
02:55:59,457 --> 02:55:59,557
[SPEAKER_19]: Aye.

1218
02:55:59,897 --> 02:55:59,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

1219
02:56:00,077 --> 02:56:00,757
[SPEAKER_04]: All those opposed?

1220
02:56:00,897 --> 02:56:01,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion passes.

1221
02:56:02,218 --> 02:56:02,478
[SPEAKER_19]: Mayor?

1222
02:56:02,758 --> 02:56:03,198
[SPEAKER_19]: Member Graham.

1223
02:56:04,158 --> 02:56:09,040
[SPEAKER_19]: Can I just invite you to join us on Zoom next week if you would prefer that?

1224
02:56:09,561 --> 02:56:16,443
[SPEAKER_19]: We would love to have you here because there's plenty of chairs, but we get it.

1225
02:56:16,763 --> 02:56:21,946
[SPEAKER_19]: If you want to join us on Zoom, I think that's totally fine, and I just want you to do what you need to do.

1226
02:56:22,166 --> 02:56:22,826
[SPEAKER_19]: We can hear you.

1227
02:56:23,387 --> 02:56:26,469
[SPEAKER_19]: whether you're on the camera or not, as long as my colleagues are in agreement.

1228
02:56:26,689 --> 02:56:28,109
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that'll be in two weeks.

1229
02:56:28,149 --> 02:56:32,091
[SPEAKER_04]: You have two weeks to get the data formulated.

1230
02:56:32,111 --> 02:56:32,852
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll be April 3rd.

1231
02:56:32,872 --> 02:56:33,992
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1232
02:56:34,253 --> 02:56:34,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Ruseau?

1233
02:56:35,493 --> 02:56:40,896
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a question about the before school pay, where we're paying teachers.

1234
02:56:42,657 --> 02:56:43,957
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that in the contract?

1235
02:56:44,158 --> 02:56:50,781
[SPEAKER_14]: And if not, how are we kind of getting around the fact that we pay them outside of the contract to work for the district?

1236
02:56:52,606 --> 02:56:55,687
[SPEAKER_14]: Did I just make a terrible faux pas and say that out loud?

1237
02:56:56,668 --> 02:56:56,988
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry.

1238
02:56:57,008 --> 02:56:59,849
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll take that under advisement and look into it.

1239
02:57:00,069 --> 02:57:00,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1240
02:57:01,210 --> 02:57:04,131
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think I would probably have to maybe look back.

1241
02:57:04,511 --> 02:57:11,114
[SPEAKER_03]: I think when before school started with just each individual school running their own before school program.

1242
02:57:11,134 --> 02:57:12,034
[SPEAKER_03]: So if Ms.

1243
02:57:12,054 --> 02:57:18,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Fidler-Carey is saying that the price has not increased since she assumed this position,

1244
02:57:20,117 --> 02:57:21,757
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's something that we can look into.

1245
02:57:21,897 --> 02:57:32,160
[SPEAKER_03]: We just have a newly agreed upon contract through the teacher's union, typically things that are outside, you know, contractual time.

1246
02:57:32,320 --> 02:57:33,540
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the difference here.

1247
02:57:34,520 --> 02:57:40,242
[SPEAKER_03]: Things that are during contractual time, there's like a pay associated with that, but that's something that we can look into.

1248
02:57:40,722 --> 02:57:41,082
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1249
02:57:41,322 --> 02:57:41,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1250
02:57:41,702 --> 02:57:41,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1251
02:57:42,762 --> 02:57:43,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1252
02:57:43,082 --> 02:57:43,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Ms.

1253
02:57:43,622 --> 02:57:44,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Fidelicari.

1254
02:57:44,623 --> 02:57:46,223
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see you on the third one way or another.

1255
02:57:46,485 --> 02:57:47,045
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1256
02:57:47,065 --> 02:57:50,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much for your time and consideration and support.

1257
02:57:51,368 --> 02:57:51,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

1258
02:57:51,869 --> 02:57:52,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for your hard work.

1259
02:57:54,591 --> 02:57:57,873
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we do not have any presentations of the public or continued business.

1260
02:57:57,973 --> 02:58:03,717
[SPEAKER_04]: We do have number nine reports requested follow up presentation on Medford high school action plan.

1261
02:58:03,817 --> 02:58:05,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Edouard-Vincent, superintendent.

1262
02:58:09,591 --> 02:58:24,736
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, so the following report is in response to some specific questions that were asked about some of the changes that have taken place at the high school.

1263
02:58:25,716 --> 02:58:36,460
[SPEAKER_16]: And so there were a lot of questions regarding how long are students waiting to use the restrooms, you know, regarding the,

1264
02:58:39,224 --> 02:58:41,446
[SPEAKER_16]: the new structures that are in place at the high school.

1265
02:58:42,287 --> 02:58:47,631
[SPEAKER_16]: And so at lunchtime, we have the cafeteria bathrooms open on all floors.

1266
02:58:49,413 --> 02:59:00,622
[SPEAKER_16]: And sometimes during that time, due to the volume of students that are eating, a line of three to four students can be there waiting anywhere from two to three minutes.

1267
02:59:02,243 --> 02:59:05,146
[SPEAKER_16]: But usually the lines are moving fairly quickly.

1268
02:59:06,701 --> 02:59:22,752
[SPEAKER_16]: As for other periods throughout the day when we don't have a large number of students eating at the same time, I'm not really noticing lines and neither are the administrative teams aware of that.

1269
02:59:24,214 --> 02:59:36,515
[SPEAKER_16]: At the end of the day, sometimes during period six, there are some students that do request to use the bathrooms at that point in time, but we've been working with them.

1270
02:59:38,166 --> 02:59:38,526
[SPEAKER_16]: on that.

1271
02:59:39,767 --> 02:59:43,769
[SPEAKER_16]: The next question that was asked was, how do we know that it's working?

1272
02:59:44,290 --> 02:59:50,933
[SPEAKER_16]: The two-person maximum for the time being right now, we really feel that it's truly ingrained.

1273
02:59:51,134 --> 02:59:53,295
[SPEAKER_16]: The students know what the expectation is.

1274
02:59:54,075 --> 03:00:00,359
[SPEAKER_16]: And so they go in, it's two students at a time outside of all of the larger bathrooms.

1275
03:00:01,420 --> 03:00:10,245
[SPEAKER_16]: We now have hooks that the students come, they hang their placards and they go into the restroom.

1276
03:00:10,305 --> 03:00:14,788
[SPEAKER_16]: So at any given time, you can see there are two placards outside.

1277
03:00:14,808 --> 03:00:19,211
[SPEAKER_16]: And when they come out, they take it and they do that.

1278
03:00:19,291 --> 03:00:22,093
[SPEAKER_16]: We've added the hooks because it helps to keep track.

1279
03:00:22,993 --> 03:00:31,741
[SPEAKER_16]: but also we just felt that it was more sanitary to keep the placards outside of the restroom as opposed to inside the restrooms.

1280
03:00:33,583 --> 03:00:39,849
[SPEAKER_16]: So the next question was, is there evidence that fewer students are outside of the classroom?

1281
03:00:39,989 --> 03:00:43,513
[SPEAKER_16]: And so the administrators pulled the data

1282
03:00:44,793 --> 03:00:56,359
[SPEAKER_16]: going back to the beginning of the year, and you can see the noted reduction in cuts that were taking place.

1283
03:00:56,800 --> 03:01:07,985
[SPEAKER_16]: And so not only do, when you're physically walking the halls, it's completely different experience, but there is hard data to support

1284
03:01:10,266 --> 03:01:11,027
[SPEAKER_16]: what we're seeing.

1285
03:01:11,547 --> 03:01:14,528
[SPEAKER_16]: And so we're very, very encouraged by that.

1286
03:01:17,729 --> 03:01:32,034
[SPEAKER_16]: Moving along, there was a question regarding about the availability in our last meeting and how do we solve this problem in a permanent and sustainable way?

1287
03:01:32,094 --> 03:01:35,896
[SPEAKER_16]: So we currently have seven building monitors at the high school.

1288
03:01:36,736 --> 03:01:59,866
[SPEAKER_16]: And so between the cameras being monitored and supervision and support throughout the high school and a designated monitor, at least at the front door, as students and guests or guests come into the building, we do feel that we have a good amount of coverage at the high school.

1289
03:02:02,116 --> 03:02:09,180
[SPEAKER_16]: in addition to the teachers that signed up to take on some of these additional duties.

1290
03:02:11,281 --> 03:02:22,246
[SPEAKER_16]: We've encountered a few glitches when we've had coverage where maybe someone was absent and that could be one of the building monitors or if someone was feeling ill, not well.

1291
03:02:22,746 --> 03:02:27,669
[SPEAKER_16]: So in those cases, we've had to shuffle around

1292
03:02:28,409 --> 03:02:36,732
[SPEAKER_16]: And if we're short coverage, then the additional administrators will step up and support with additional coverage.

1293
03:02:37,452 --> 03:02:52,157
[SPEAKER_16]: But again, we do feel at this point in time with the seven monitors that are currently working at the high school, that we feel that it is a manageable number and sustainable.

1294
03:02:53,908 --> 03:02:58,651
[SPEAKER_16]: So question two, again, was about do we see fewer students roaming the hallways?

1295
03:02:59,172 --> 03:03:14,122
[SPEAKER_16]: And again, if you refer to the same table that was in question one, yes, it is definitely very obvious and there is a difference.

1296
03:03:16,043 --> 03:03:25,186
[SPEAKER_16]: And a culture shift is taking place at the high school and we are paying close attention to that.

1297
03:03:26,126 --> 03:03:34,708
[SPEAKER_16]: So the next question was about the sustainability and the distribution of the school IDs.

1298
03:03:35,308 --> 03:03:44,031
[SPEAKER_16]: And that which I shared in my last update is an area where we are looking at other options and one of the

1299
03:03:45,131 --> 03:03:57,239
[SPEAKER_16]: possible suggestions was is there an opportunity to provide electronic IDs or some kind of ID, given that smartphones are everywhere, which we thought was a, you know, excellent suggestion.

1300
03:03:57,259 --> 03:04:04,304
[SPEAKER_16]: And so we are, you know, willing to look at other options and that could be because again,

1301
03:04:05,525 --> 03:04:17,214
[SPEAKER_16]: Almost every student has a telephone, so it would just be a question of them potentially being able to show their identification through an electronic ID of some sort.

1302
03:04:17,555 --> 03:04:21,458
[SPEAKER_16]: So we are trying to explore and look into that as an option.

1303
03:04:23,496 --> 03:04:27,517
[SPEAKER_16]: Question three was, has there been an increase in the report of bullying?

1304
03:04:28,397 --> 03:04:35,859
[SPEAKER_16]: And so for the 21-22 school year, there were seven reports of bullying.

1305
03:04:36,739 --> 03:04:43,981
[SPEAKER_16]: And as of March 15 of 2022, there were two confirmed bullying situations.

1306
03:04:44,941 --> 03:04:47,345
[SPEAKER_16]: During the school year.

1307
03:04:48,807 --> 03:04:55,577
[SPEAKER_16]: We have had 10 reports of bullying, bullying, two of them have been confirmed at the high school.

1308
03:04:56,117 --> 03:04:59,362
[SPEAKER_16]: And so, some of you may wonder why is there a discrepancy.

1309
03:05:01,063 --> 03:05:03,024
[SPEAKER_16]: With the reports that go forward.

1310
03:05:04,465 --> 03:05:07,266
[SPEAKER_16]: There could be a variety of solutions.

1311
03:05:08,226 --> 03:05:15,109
[SPEAKER_16]: There have been restorative circles they have been meetings with students and families where bullying report was.

1312
03:05:16,330 --> 03:05:30,673
[SPEAKER_16]: submitted but you know the parties came down, came together sat down, had conversations and families chose not to go further with the bullying investigation that happens sometimes.

1313
03:05:31,293 --> 03:05:51,770
[SPEAKER_16]: We also have some students that a bullying report may have been started for a student and over the course of the investigation and looking into additional supports for those students, that some students may currently be placed in other settings.

1314
03:05:52,191 --> 03:05:55,994
[SPEAKER_16]: So they received other settings that would provide additional support to them.

1315
03:05:56,694 --> 03:06:08,016
[SPEAKER_16]: And so in those cases, sometimes the bullying report, because the student was receiving additional supports elsewhere, that that's why that number does not show.

1316
03:06:08,436 --> 03:06:21,579
[SPEAKER_16]: Also, sometimes when the bullying investigation takes place and it runs its full course, that in the end, it may not be identified or found it to be bullying.

1317
03:06:22,299 --> 03:06:26,441
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's also another factor.

1318
03:06:26,661 --> 03:06:39,226
[SPEAKER_16]: But at this point in time for the high school for this year, there are two official confirmed bullying reports that are on record at this point in time.

1319
03:06:41,671 --> 03:06:52,116
[SPEAKER_16]: The next question was, has there been an audit of appropriateness of prior decisions to ensure that prior decisions were made in compliance with our definitions and policies?

1320
03:06:52,937 --> 03:07:07,564
[SPEAKER_16]: So the administrative team debriefs regularly, including conversations with our medical staff, our school Councilors, engagement specialists, and other building administrative members to ensure

1321
03:07:08,324 --> 03:07:18,150
[SPEAKER_16]: that appropriate disciplinary measures are being meted out based on the needs of the specific child or student.

1322
03:07:18,810 --> 03:07:23,813
[SPEAKER_16]: So I can say that not every situation is a one size fits all.

1323
03:07:24,393 --> 03:07:27,575
[SPEAKER_16]: There are special situations

1324
03:07:28,075 --> 03:07:30,236
[SPEAKER_16]: that are taken into consideration.

1325
03:07:30,336 --> 03:07:47,124
[SPEAKER_16]: And so we do collaborate consistently with other members of our team, again, including our medical staff, our Councilors, our adjustment specialists, our engagement specialists, our adjustment Councilors, school psychologists.

1326
03:07:48,244 --> 03:07:56,128
[SPEAKER_16]: We bring in many different stakeholders as we look at situations that arise.

1327
03:07:58,427 --> 03:08:01,209
[SPEAKER_16]: Has the district been responding in a timely way?

1328
03:08:01,870 --> 03:08:05,213
[SPEAKER_16]: So the district is responding in a timely way.

1329
03:08:05,233 --> 03:08:15,842
[SPEAKER_16]: The responding administrator follows up with the reporter within 24 to 48 hours or sooner, depending on what the situation is.

1330
03:08:15,902 --> 03:08:24,650
[SPEAKER_16]: So there is frequent communication between teachers and administrators, and there is a response within 24 to 48 hours.

1331
03:08:26,632 --> 03:08:35,244
[SPEAKER_16]: And again, decisions are made as soon as practicable based on the details and complexity of what is being reported.

1332
03:08:38,345 --> 03:08:45,310
[SPEAKER_16]: Question four, when will the handbook be presented to the school committee for review and approval?

1333
03:08:45,911 --> 03:08:54,617
[SPEAKER_16]: So the high school site council reviews and makes final recommendations at the beginning of May.

1334
03:08:55,838 --> 03:09:01,983
[SPEAKER_16]: This handbook can be presented to the school committee anytime once the site council review is completed.

1335
03:09:02,643 --> 03:09:12,829
[SPEAKER_16]: We anticipate bringing an updated version before the committee with revisions by late May to early June of this year.

1336
03:09:12,849 --> 03:09:22,515
[SPEAKER_16]: And again, the date can be changed at the discretion of the committee, but since it is something that the site councils do look at, there are periodic

1337
03:09:24,417 --> 03:09:32,267
[SPEAKER_16]: Revisions that may have been done but in light of the greater substantive changes that took place this year.

1338
03:09:33,689 --> 03:09:39,958
[SPEAKER_16]: We want to be able to just work with the site council and then bring it to the committee by late May early June.

1339
03:09:41,780 --> 03:09:46,924
[SPEAKER_16]: And the percentage of acknowledgement forms, they have been signed by students and families.

1340
03:09:47,485 --> 03:09:55,511
[SPEAKER_16]: The hard copies are kept in the assistant principal offices on file.

1341
03:09:55,871 --> 03:10:00,875
[SPEAKER_16]: So each house has approximately, you know, 400 students, give or take.

1342
03:10:01,455 --> 03:10:05,758
[SPEAKER_16]: So we are just working on getting those tallies.

1343
03:10:06,459 --> 03:10:11,623
[SPEAKER_16]: And I can work on getting that to the committee, what the final percentage was.

1344
03:10:13,376 --> 03:10:20,199
[SPEAKER_16]: How will we know that this worked and what will be or look different if this action was effective?

1345
03:10:20,579 --> 03:10:29,022
[SPEAKER_16]: So I do feel the hard referral data to the assistant principals has gone down at a significant rate.

1346
03:10:29,802 --> 03:10:35,485
[SPEAKER_16]: This has allowed them to effectively manage and address student behaviors in a timely fashion.

1347
03:10:36,625 --> 03:10:46,351
[SPEAKER_16]: Students are reporting during monthly listening sessions that they feel safer now at the high school with the changes that have been made since January.

1348
03:10:47,552 --> 03:10:51,994
[SPEAKER_16]: Staff are also reporting that they visibly see less roaming in the hallways.

1349
03:10:53,195 --> 03:10:57,418
[SPEAKER_16]: and students spending more time in their classes.

1350
03:10:58,279 --> 03:11:08,406
[SPEAKER_16]: Students are following the protocols, using the placards when they need to use the restroom or if they need to go visit one of the other offices.

1351
03:11:09,147 --> 03:11:12,769
[SPEAKER_16]: So that is really being fully used.

1352
03:11:13,410 --> 03:11:18,553
[SPEAKER_16]: And the eHaul pass system is also giving us additional accurate data.

1353
03:11:19,614 --> 03:11:21,915
[SPEAKER_16]: When a student leaves the classroom and returns.

1354
03:11:22,696 --> 03:11:28,419
[SPEAKER_16]: So, the other piece is the change in tardy check in process.

1355
03:11:29,099 --> 03:11:33,802
[SPEAKER_16]: It's allowed us to consistently see which students are coming to school late in real time.

1356
03:11:34,882 --> 03:11:52,074
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think all of these changes have significantly contributed to more calm and greater consistency and clarity around expectations at the high school.

1357
03:11:52,534 --> 03:11:57,998
[SPEAKER_16]: So I just wanted to make sure that I responded to all the questions that I had received.

1358
03:11:58,558 --> 03:11:58,898
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1359
03:11:59,219 --> 03:12:00,399
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Dr. Edouard-Vincent.

1360
03:12:00,980 --> 03:12:01,280
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1361
03:12:01,300 --> 03:12:02,101
[SPEAKER_14]: There's one question.

1362
03:12:03,736 --> 03:12:04,056
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1363
03:12:04,076 --> 03:12:18,924
[SPEAKER_14]: Sometimes I ask questions that make me laugh because I'm the only man in this at this table, but I'm guessing all of you have stood in a line to use the bathroom as women while there's no line for the men's room.

1364
03:12:19,224 --> 03:12:21,825
[SPEAKER_14]: And the women's line is not true.

1365
03:12:22,685 --> 03:12:26,687
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just saying like, I just was talking about this with Jenny the other day.

1366
03:12:26,707 --> 03:12:29,829
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't even remember what we were talking about, but that

1367
03:12:30,202 --> 03:12:35,264
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, the line, somehow society has still not figured out that women need a little more time in the bathroom.

1368
03:12:35,964 --> 03:12:52,371
[SPEAKER_14]: And I guess I'm just, from my own students' perspective, you know, and from other students' perspectives, students used to not want to use the bathrooms because they didn't think they were clean enough or they weren't safe enough.

1369
03:12:52,955 --> 03:13:04,477
[SPEAKER_14]: And now it's just not worth it sometimes for the amount of time it takes to use a bathroom is what I'm hearing.

1370
03:13:04,897 --> 03:13:12,978
[SPEAKER_14]: And so students not drinking and eating isn't really conducive to the best being prepared for an education.

1371
03:13:13,058 --> 03:13:21,660
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you're telling me that the girls can get in and out of the bathrooms just as fast as the boys,

1372
03:13:24,005 --> 03:13:29,167
[SPEAKER_14]: You're all the professionals on what it means to be a female waiting in line for a bathroom.

1373
03:13:30,148 --> 03:13:31,108
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm obviously not.

1374
03:13:31,288 --> 03:13:37,251
[SPEAKER_14]: And as a man, I will say that I just don't know how you all put up with it.

1375
03:13:37,711 --> 03:13:43,114
[SPEAKER_14]: Every single time I go to any place where there's crowds, I cannot believe you don't revolt.

1376
03:13:44,194 --> 03:13:44,795
[SPEAKER_14]: And so-

1377
03:13:48,898 --> 03:14:02,636
[SPEAKER_14]: I still can't believe that two people, and honestly, I don't know what the lawyers would have to say if we said the rule is different for the girls versus the boys, but I certainly can't believe that two girls at the time is enough.

1378
03:14:03,157 --> 03:14:06,358
[SPEAKER_14]: to get all of our students through the bathrooms that are open?

1379
03:14:06,418 --> 03:14:22,023
[SPEAKER_16]: So there were only three stalls, but not only that, I think now that there are the new rules in place and the students are hanging their placards, they're going in, they're doing their business and they're coming right back out.

1380
03:14:23,024 --> 03:14:25,845
[SPEAKER_16]: I think before they were going in and

1381
03:14:28,317 --> 03:14:37,683
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, that level of socializing, if you don't have a group of people to socialize with, there are only two people, you're gonna just go in, do your business and come out.

1382
03:14:38,283 --> 03:14:44,267
[SPEAKER_16]: So even the times that I've done bathroom duty, it's pretty quick.

1383
03:14:44,287 --> 03:14:49,430
[SPEAKER_16]: They go in, they know they might see two or three people waiting, they go in, they come out, they go in, they come out.

1384
03:14:50,871 --> 03:14:54,113
[SPEAKER_16]: And where you have the bathroom stacked,

1385
03:14:55,154 --> 03:15:02,381
[SPEAKER_16]: If one area were to have a slightly longer line, they know they can just go up one floor, which some students have done.

1386
03:15:02,401 --> 03:15:02,861
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1387
03:15:03,081 --> 03:15:04,423
[SPEAKER_16]: Or up a floor or down a floor.

1388
03:15:04,443 --> 03:15:06,344
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I've seen it happen.

1389
03:15:06,485 --> 03:15:11,369
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll just have to trust you on this, because I don't really spend much time in women's bathrooms, but thank you.

1390
03:15:11,449 --> 03:15:11,970
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate it.

1391
03:15:12,490 --> 03:15:13,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Hays, then Member Graham.

1392
03:15:14,772 --> 03:15:15,653
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Hays, you first.

1393
03:15:17,875 --> 03:15:18,776
[SPEAKER_04]: It's who I see first.

1394
03:15:21,752 --> 03:15:22,092
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1395
03:15:23,613 --> 03:15:25,174
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just wondering two things.

1396
03:15:25,194 --> 03:15:34,400
[SPEAKER_15]: Will the student survey that we're going to do, will that be asking some questions about their current experience with the new rules in place?

1397
03:15:34,720 --> 03:15:38,242
[SPEAKER_15]: And do we have an updated timeline for that or when that's going to happen?

1398
03:15:39,301 --> 03:15:51,691
[SPEAKER_16]: So the answer is yes, the survey is in the Panorama portal and the translations, Dr. Cushing, are the translations in the portal as well?

1399
03:15:51,732 --> 03:15:53,433
[SPEAKER_16]: That was the last piece we were waiting on.

1400
03:15:53,453 --> 03:16:01,660
[SPEAKER_12]: We're currently working on the translations as it's our own tool, just trying to work on getting those translations done.

1401
03:16:02,000 --> 03:16:06,484
[SPEAKER_12]: So Penny Bruce has those as well.

1402
03:16:07,042 --> 03:16:12,805
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just making sure that I'm correlating the one-to-one to make sure that they're matching.

1403
03:16:13,165 --> 03:16:15,766
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's just a little bit of a timely process.

1404
03:16:16,807 --> 03:16:26,171
[SPEAKER_12]: But the hope is later this week is the hope and no later than the beginning of next week.

1405
03:16:26,731 --> 03:16:26,951
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.

1406
03:16:27,932 --> 03:16:28,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

1407
03:16:29,392 --> 03:16:29,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Graham.

1408
03:16:33,626 --> 03:16:34,067
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1409
03:16:34,527 --> 03:16:35,567
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you for the support.

1410
03:16:35,647 --> 03:16:47,555
[SPEAKER_19]: I know I've peppered you with a lot of questions and I just wanted to like read this out for people who don't have this in front of them and we should make it available.

1411
03:16:48,135 --> 03:16:52,938
[SPEAKER_19]: One of the questions was like, how do we know what evidence do we have that there are fewer students out of class?

1412
03:16:53,878 --> 03:16:58,481
[SPEAKER_19]: And the superintendent provided us a chart on this report that we have.

1413
03:16:59,441 --> 03:17:05,725
[SPEAKER_19]: And in September, the average number of classes cut per day for the student body was 19.

1414
03:17:05,885 --> 03:17:08,107
[SPEAKER_19]: In October, it was 31.

1415
03:17:08,367 --> 03:17:10,648
[SPEAKER_19]: In November, it was 35.

1416
03:17:11,589 --> 03:17:13,650
[SPEAKER_19]: In December, it was 43.

1417
03:17:14,771 --> 03:17:17,413
[SPEAKER_19]: In January, it was 14.

1418
03:17:18,673 --> 03:17:20,374
[SPEAKER_19]: And in February, it was 16.

1419
03:17:20,655 --> 03:17:27,419
[SPEAKER_19]: So I just wanted to point out that this is a really great example of data telling us that it worked.

1420
03:17:28,642 --> 03:17:29,403
[SPEAKER_19]: or it's working.

1421
03:17:29,623 --> 03:17:50,355
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it also tells us that things weren't working between October and December, which is unfortunate because I think we had ample warning in October that we had an issue that was not responded to in the best way possible because now we're seeing that when we respond with rules and structure for our high school campus, things get better.

1422
03:17:50,435 --> 03:17:51,796
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think that's really great news.

1423
03:17:53,517 --> 03:17:55,978
[SPEAKER_19]: The other thing that I wanted to point out is I think

1424
03:17:56,420 --> 03:18:08,307
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that the conversation around having seven building monitors, um, but also being limited to the number of bathrooms we can open tells me that that equation is not quite right.

1425
03:18:08,327 --> 03:18:20,773
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, so I think, I'm not sure there's much to do about it like right now in this moment, but when we talk about the budget for next year, like I do want to know, like, how do we open the bathrooms?

1426
03:18:20,874 --> 03:18:23,415
[SPEAKER_19]: Because we as a committee have talked about this.

1427
03:18:24,460 --> 03:18:26,661
[SPEAKER_19]: multiple times a year every year since I've been on the committee.

1428
03:18:26,681 --> 03:18:33,223
[SPEAKER_19]: And I would really love not to talk about whether the bathrooms are or aren't open again at some point in time.

1429
03:18:33,663 --> 03:18:39,465
[SPEAKER_19]: But I don't say that to mean that I don't care that it's a lawless land inside the bathroom.

1430
03:18:39,645 --> 03:18:40,986
[SPEAKER_19]: That's not the point at all.

1431
03:18:41,046 --> 03:18:48,548
[SPEAKER_19]: But in order for there to be ample open bathrooms available for students wherever their classes are,

1432
03:18:50,316 --> 03:18:54,857
[SPEAKER_19]: seven may not be the right magical number based on the information that's provided here.

1433
03:18:54,937 --> 03:19:13,042
[SPEAKER_19]: So again, I just would like to see us think about that during the budget and figure out like what really is sustainable because, you know, relying on people to fill in who also have to be expected to fill in for teachers that don't come because we have no substitutes seems like it's actually not super sustainable.

1434
03:19:13,062 --> 03:19:19,744
[SPEAKER_19]: So I just want to make sure that as we head into next year, as we begin a principal search that we're going to set up

1435
03:19:20,182 --> 03:19:25,403
[SPEAKER_19]: whoever our new principle is for success with like systems and structures that work and are sustainable.

1436
03:19:25,463 --> 03:19:29,444
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think that's really important for us to think about as we go forward and as we build the budget.

1437
03:19:29,684 --> 03:19:30,464
[SPEAKER_19]: So thank you for this.

1438
03:19:30,884 --> 03:19:31,204
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1439
03:19:31,884 --> 03:19:32,064
[SPEAKER_07]: Ms.

1440
03:19:32,084 --> 03:19:32,464
[SPEAKER_07]: Branley.

1441
03:19:39,186 --> 03:19:39,526
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello.

1442
03:19:43,627 --> 03:19:44,047
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you hear me?

1443
03:19:44,287 --> 03:19:44,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

1444
03:19:44,447 --> 03:19:44,747
[SPEAKER_04]: Branley?

1445
03:19:46,707 --> 03:19:47,007
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm here.

1446
03:19:47,027 --> 03:19:47,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you hear me?

1447
03:19:47,768 --> 03:19:49,388
[SPEAKER_08]: I do.

1448
03:19:49,468 --> 03:19:49,928
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you hear me?

1449
03:19:50,794 --> 03:19:51,515
[SPEAKER_06]: You must not be able to.

1450
03:19:51,975 --> 03:19:52,836
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we can't hear you.

1451
03:20:00,521 --> 03:20:01,062
[SPEAKER_07]: Any other questions?

1452
03:20:01,102 --> 03:20:01,422
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello?

1453
03:20:03,083 --> 03:20:03,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

1454
03:20:03,263 --> 03:20:03,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Brindley?

1455
03:20:04,504 --> 03:20:05,505
[SPEAKER_09]: Nope.

1456
03:20:05,525 --> 03:20:06,265
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, she can't hear me.

1457
03:20:24,394 --> 03:20:24,914
[SPEAKER_08]: Can she hear me?

1458
03:20:26,095 --> 03:20:26,515
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1459
03:20:27,456 --> 03:20:28,217
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, here I am.

1460
03:20:31,439 --> 03:20:33,140
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so my question, hello.

1461
03:20:33,880 --> 03:20:40,465
[SPEAKER_08]: So my question was, I was just wondering if I can have a copy of the superintendent's report, if that's possible for the public and not just for the committee.

1462
03:20:41,505 --> 03:20:44,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely, well, are we gonna put it on the website?

1463
03:20:45,808 --> 03:20:47,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, actually member Ruseau just sent it to you.

1464
03:20:48,650 --> 03:20:49,731
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, thank you.

1465
03:20:50,792 --> 03:20:53,333
[SPEAKER_08]: And then my other question is for,

1466
03:20:56,292 --> 03:21:13,400
[SPEAKER_08]: The numbers for the reports and the bullying, I'm just curious, how do we know, I guess we don't know, but I just wanted to make this, just put this out there that, you know, in a lot of cases, I don't think the bullying reporting was happening.

1467
03:21:14,781 --> 03:21:23,925
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think the numbers look good, but was all the bullying reporting actually happening?

1468
03:21:25,193 --> 03:21:34,339
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that that's something just to think about that the numbers don't look bad, but was it actually accurate?

1469
03:21:35,579 --> 03:21:40,862
[SPEAKER_08]: So I know in our situation, we did not have a bullying report until after an injury.

1470
03:21:42,183 --> 03:21:46,806
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know in another case, a bullying report was handed to a parent and said, here, read this and fill this out.

1471
03:21:46,886 --> 03:21:50,188
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm not really sure who's responsible in filling that paperwork out.

1472
03:21:50,848 --> 03:21:52,209
[SPEAKER_08]: I know the nurse did it for us.

1473
03:21:53,326 --> 03:21:57,308
[SPEAKER_08]: But, um, in her case, it was handed to the parent and said, fill this out.

1474
03:21:57,628 --> 03:22:08,634
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm not sure, uh, how that bullying report is supposed to really be reported and by who, um, and if that those steps have really been taken in the past.

1475
03:22:09,154 --> 03:22:11,876
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just wanted to, um, throw that out there.

1476
03:22:14,257 --> 03:22:15,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Miss Friendly.

1477
03:22:15,518 --> 03:22:15,878
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1478
03:22:19,960 --> 03:22:29,382
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm assuming bullying reports are all funneled through to the top, and that's how we got the data, but whether or not some, yeah, at the principal level?

1479
03:22:29,722 --> 03:22:31,423
[SPEAKER_07]: It goes to the, yeah, of each school.

1480
03:22:33,343 --> 03:22:37,304
[SPEAKER_06]: When it's turned in.

1481
03:22:37,324 --> 03:22:38,684
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. Cushing and then Member Graham.

1482
03:22:45,366 --> 03:22:47,126
[SPEAKER_12]: For the last, at least,

1483
03:22:47,768 --> 03:23:08,454
[SPEAKER_12]: two plus years, we have instructed any time that a school leader or any time a member of the assistant principal or principals hears the word bullying, that we immediately hand them the forms and the policy, which I know is being worked on right now.

1484
03:23:08,574 --> 03:23:09,774
[SPEAKER_12]: Traditionally, it's the forms.

1485
03:23:10,935 --> 03:23:15,136
[SPEAKER_12]: Generally speaking, not generally speaking, per policy and state law, anyone can fill out

1486
03:23:15,788 --> 03:23:18,649
[SPEAKER_12]: a bullying report and submit it and can be submitted anonymously.

1487
03:23:20,209 --> 03:23:35,253
[SPEAKER_12]: In large part, if, as Miss Branley just said, if in large part if it's being handed to a parent or someone else to fill out, that's because they are probably the best person with the most accurate information to be able to

1488
03:23:35,714 --> 03:23:49,245
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, perhaps give screen captures or to give text messages or to give other people that they are the one most, if they're uncomfortable and they were like, no, based on what I have, then a school leader can also do that.

1489
03:23:49,325 --> 03:24:03,356
[SPEAKER_12]: But realizing that there may be a significant amount of firsthand, very important information that won't be captured and, you know, should be captured by the reporting party, as opposed to, um,

1490
03:24:04,456 --> 03:24:10,546
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, someone who doesn't have necessarily firsthand knowledge and also may then be required to further investigate it.

1491
03:24:11,588 --> 03:24:17,218
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's why giving it to the reporting party is usually the best practice to make sure that that happens.

1492
03:24:18,285 --> 03:24:19,065
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

1493
03:24:19,386 --> 03:24:20,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you want to say, member Graham?

1494
03:24:22,147 --> 03:24:22,688
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1495
03:24:22,708 --> 03:24:31,353
[SPEAKER_19]: I think the other thing, the rules and policy subcommittee is working on a refresh of the bullying policy.

1496
03:24:31,493 --> 03:24:43,920
[SPEAKER_19]: And we had a lot of conversation in the last meeting that we held around the district's obligations in terms of awareness and making sure people understand the steps

1497
03:24:46,417 --> 03:25:00,388
[SPEAKER_19]: and making sure that there's some proactive measure happening when parents are talking about or students are talking about how they may be struggling so that people know what those options are and what the protocol is.

1498
03:25:00,468 --> 03:25:06,012
[SPEAKER_19]: So I do think that the revised policy that comes out will have

1499
03:25:07,074 --> 03:25:11,598
[SPEAKER_19]: some additional steps to try to like close the gap, because I think the gap that Ms.

1500
03:25:11,618 --> 03:25:17,443
[SPEAKER_19]: Branley is talking about is real, which is if you didn't know that that was the thing you were supposed to do, you didn't do it.

1501
03:25:17,543 --> 03:25:25,790
[SPEAKER_19]: And we can't, we can't know how many people fall into that situation, but we can be aware that it happens.

1502
03:25:25,950 --> 03:25:30,674
[SPEAKER_19]: It happened at least, you know, we're hearing that from one person, but we have heard that from many people.

1503
03:25:32,136 --> 03:25:34,678
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think as we do finish the policy work,

1504
03:25:35,219 --> 03:26:00,071
[SPEAKER_19]: it'll be important to make sure that when we talk about that policy and the translation to practice, that there is a way to sort of close that gap that doesn't dilute the meaningfulness of the information that you need to actually properly investigate a bullying report, but does close the gap around the unreported, which is what's really, really hard to get at.

1505
03:26:01,092 --> 03:26:01,412
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1506
03:26:02,492 --> 03:26:02,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1507
03:26:02,832 --> 03:26:03,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Member McLaughlin?

1508
03:26:05,134 --> 03:26:05,814
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, thank you.

1509
03:26:06,555 --> 03:26:11,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I think that really parent information is obviously very important.

1510
03:26:11,097 --> 03:26:21,743
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a training last week that Medford Public Schools collaborated with on the CPAC for a training for parents and professionals on bullying, and I think that having

1511
03:26:22,441 --> 03:26:23,882
[SPEAKER_02]: more of those is important.

1512
03:26:23,982 --> 03:26:31,067
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, again, even, you know, quarterly or at the beginning of the year and middle of the year or something so that folks do know this.

1513
03:26:31,167 --> 03:26:41,054
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we just have to also keep an open mind and ask ourselves if we're doing that, how we're getting that information translated to families that need to know.

1514
03:26:41,174 --> 03:26:45,597
[SPEAKER_02]: So all part of the process, I think, as we're looking at the policy piece.

1515
03:26:46,558 --> 03:26:46,978
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1516
03:26:47,198 --> 03:26:47,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

1517
03:26:48,339 --> 03:26:49,340
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for the report.

1518
03:26:50,097 --> 03:27:03,051
[SPEAKER_04]: We have one condolence of the Medford School Committee expressions its sincere condolences to the family of Anthony A. Teixeira Jr., United States Navy veteran and father of ESL Director Paul Teixeira.

1519
03:27:03,071 --> 03:27:04,913
[SPEAKER_04]: If we all may rise for a moment of silence.

1520
03:27:17,810 --> 03:27:18,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1521
03:27:18,652 --> 03:27:26,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Our next regular meeting, which is the sixth regular meeting of the school committee, will be held on April 3rd in the chambers, also on Zoom.

1522
03:27:28,910 --> 03:27:30,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a motion for... Motion to adjourn.

1523
03:27:31,414 --> 03:27:34,780
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to adjourn by Member Graham, seconded by Member Kreatz.

1524
03:27:35,000 --> 03:27:35,301
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in
