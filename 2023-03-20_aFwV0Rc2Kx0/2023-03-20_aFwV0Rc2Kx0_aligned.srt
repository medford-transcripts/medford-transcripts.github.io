Mayor Longo Kern.

19
00:00:35,134 --> 00:00:36,694
Present, seven present, zero absent.

20
00:00:36,714 --> 00:00:38,314
If we could rise to salute the flag.

21
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:48,516
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

22
00:00:50,037 --> 00:00:51,937
We have negotiations and legal matters.

23
00:00:51,997 --> 00:00:53,578
Executive session, 5 p.m.

24
00:00:53,838 --> 00:00:55,318
Upon motion, we will enter

26
00:01:10,658 --> 00:01:15,759
Memphis School Committee will convene in public session immediately following the conclusion of the executive session at 6 p.m.

27
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:22,601
So motion to move to executive session by member McLaughlin, seconded by

00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,060

Member Ms.

39
00:01:34,543 --> 00:01:34,803

Yes.

45
00:01:38,424 --> 00:01:39,724
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

46
00:01:40,084 --> 00:01:42,005
We're gonna go to executive session.

47
01:05:24,465 --> 01:05:27,128
Dr. Maurice Edward Vincent.

48
01:05:58,749 --> 01:05:59,289
Good evening.

49
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:12,837
So I will preface that I do have some lengthy remarks this morning, this afternoon, or this evening I should say, but a lot of good news to share a lot of wonderful things happening this month.

50
01:06:13,657 --> 01:06:16,319
And so I'm going to get started.

51
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:24,845
March is National Disability Awareness Month, and tomorrow is World Down Syndrome Day.

52
01:06:26,126 --> 01:06:40,715
National Disability Awareness Month began in 1987, when President Ronald Reagan proclaimed it to raise awareness about the importance of inclusion of people with developmental disabilities in all facets of community life.

53
01:06:41,656 --> 01:06:50,043
It also brings to our attention the barriers that people with disabilities can sometimes face when connecting to the communities in which they live.

54
01:06:50,964 --> 01:06:58,711
In Medford, we are proud that we are an inclusive community for all, but we are constantly learning about how we can do better.

55
01:07:01,627 --> 01:07:10,733
And again, as tomorrow being World Down Syndrome Day, it's a global awareness day officially observed by the United Nations since 2012.

56
01:07:13,235 --> 01:07:29,265
This year's theme is With Us, Not For Us, which means people with disabilities have the right to be treated fairly and have the same opportunities as everyone else, working with others to improve their lives.

57
01:07:30,346 --> 01:07:34,870
As you are aware, those with Down syndrome have an extra chromosome.

58
01:07:35,631 --> 01:07:41,517
So often people will wear crazy socks on March 21st.

59
01:07:42,497 --> 01:07:46,301
I'm told that chromosomes are shaped like socks.

60
01:07:47,422 --> 01:07:50,585
So get your craziest socks ready to wear for tomorrow.

61
01:07:53,112 --> 01:08:11,920
On behalf of the Medford Public Schools, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate one of our state representatives, Christine Barber, for receiving the Legislator of the Year award from the Massachusetts Developmental Disabilities Council and the Arc of Massachusetts.

62
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:17,002
For her work with people with intellectual and developmental disabilities,

63
01:08:18,075 --> 01:08:29,446
Representative Barber serves as a member of the Massachusetts Autism Commission and works directly with advocates to address challenges facing the disability community.

64
01:08:29,947 --> 01:08:32,530
So congratulations State Rep Christine Barber.

65
01:08:34,532 --> 01:08:34,772
Yes.

66
01:08:38,556 --> 01:08:38,916
Thank you.

67
01:08:39,864 --> 01:08:52,334
Today, the Medford Vocational Technical High School students in the Early Childhood Education Program begin a story, song, and art activity event with the Medford Family Network.

68
01:08:53,455 --> 01:08:57,478
This program started today and will continue on March 22nd, March 27th,

69
01:09:00,660 --> 01:09:01,841
and March 29th.

70
01:09:02,701 --> 01:09:09,385
The early education students will lead the children in sing-alongs, art, and STEAM activities.

71
01:09:09,925 --> 01:09:11,786
They will also read them stories.

72
01:09:12,306 --> 01:09:19,370
Truly, this is a win-win partnership for both our students and our young student group community.

73
01:09:20,950 --> 01:09:25,892
This coming Wednesday, March 22nd is Crossing Guard Appreciation Day.

74
01:09:26,712 --> 01:09:33,295
We can't thank our crossing guards enough for keeping our students safe and helping them get to and from school.

75
01:09:33,995 --> 01:09:36,916
Remember to thank them, especially on Wednesday.

76
01:09:38,593 --> 01:09:46,475
Also on March 22nd, we'll be hosting a Zoom informational meeting for parents of incoming middle school students.

77
01:09:47,736 --> 01:09:50,897
These are our fifth graders rising up to sixth grade.

78
01:09:51,597 --> 01:09:54,458
We will discuss the lottery and middle school curriculum.

79
01:09:55,438 --> 01:09:57,959
Please join us from 5 to 6 p.m.

80
01:09:58,719 --> 01:10:02,460
The lottery will be live on Zoom on Wednesday, April 12th.

81
01:10:05,661 --> 01:10:18,151
Also on March 22nd, our CTE programs, our career technical education programs, will be hosting a showcase at Medford Vocational Technical High School from 6 to 8 p.m.

82
01:10:18,171 --> 01:10:25,357
All 8th graders and their families are welcome to attend this Wednesday, March 22nd.

83
01:10:27,876 --> 01:10:38,781
March is also National Women's History Month, and both Medford High School and the Vocational School have planned informational events for all of our students.

84
01:10:39,761 --> 01:10:49,686
The Vocational School kicked off Women's History Month on March 2nd, when they presented six guest speakers from the construction and technology industries.

85
01:10:50,666 --> 01:10:56,890
This panel focused on women and individuals who are non-traditional employees in their field.

86
01:10:57,911 --> 01:11:19,525
Students in grades nine through 12 from the construction cluster, electrical, carpentry, construction craft labors, and metal fabrication, and the technology cluster, which includes engineering, robotics, and programming, and web development participated in this event.

87
01:11:20,826 --> 01:11:26,949
Panelists shared stories about how their personal career paths led them to their current position.

88
01:11:27,990 --> 01:11:34,513
As one of the panelists stated, you have to get comfortable being the only you in the room.

89
01:11:35,574 --> 01:11:41,537
So get comfortable with being uncomfortable in educating others that you belong there.

90
01:11:42,277 --> 01:11:47,200
We thank the following panelists for taking the time to address our students.

91
01:11:48,401 --> 01:11:56,285

01:12:31,967 --> 01:12:40,471
I thank all of those panelists who came out to support us during that National Women's History Month event, and we will continue to have more events.

98
01:12:41,372 --> 01:12:50,056
Continuing with that theme, on March 31st, the Medford High School will present its second annual women's panel.

105
01:13:57,805 --> 01:14:03,150
I would also like to take this time to recognize some of our outstanding athletes.

106
01:14:04,110 --> 01:14:16,301
The winter athletic season has come to a close, and a number of Mustangs have been named GBL All-Stars and recognized for other outstanding achievements.

115
01:15:24,925 --> 01:15:28,470
For girls, indoor track, Anna Casey,

116
01:15:29,691 --> 01:15:34,812
Yasmin D'Souza-Vieira, Maria Colombo, and Savannah Nash.

117
01:15:36,052 --> 01:15:39,673
In addition, the team won the GBL Championship.

And for boys indoor track, Dimitri Charles, Richard Gomez-McDonald, and Will Kelly, who qualified for the Nike National Indoor Track Championships held in New York last weekend.

119
01:15:56,037 --> 01:15:59,569
Can we give all of those wonderful athletes a round of applause?

120
01:16:05,774 --> 01:16:15,281
I do wanna share that Will placed 20th in the boys 400 meters, emerging in the elite division.

121
01:16:16,142 --> 01:16:22,927
By qualifying for indoor nationals, he also qualified for the outdoor nationals in June.

122
01:16:23,948 --> 01:16:32,754
Athletes that qualify for this competition often go on to be college stars and some represent their country at the Olympics.

123
01:16:33,835 --> 01:16:38,401
Congratulations to Roe and all of our winter sports student-athletes.

124
01:16:38,841 --> 01:16:40,023
You make us so proud.

125
01:16:40,043 --> 01:16:47,132
Today, spring sports begin their tryouts, so good luck to all of those trying out this week.

126
01:16:49,329 --> 01:16:55,831
Also, last week, I want to recognize our Director of Counseling and Behavioral Health, Stacey Shulman.

127
01:16:56,491 --> 01:17:05,033
She served as a panelist for our District Attorney, Marion Ryan's presentation, Dealing with Gun Violence in Schools.

128
01:17:06,114 --> 01:17:14,496
Over 130 people from law enforcement, education, and nonprofit fields attended from Middlesex County.

129
01:17:15,416 --> 01:17:23,322
Stacey spoke of the Medford Public Schools commitment to the Sandy Hook promise, which began with our partnership in 2019.

130
01:17:23,362 --> 01:17:43,357
As Stacey mentioned at our last meeting, prevention strategies such as start with hello and say something have been shown to significantly improve perceptions of school safety, foster socialization, reduce bullying, and begin to change culture from within.

131
01:17:44,798 --> 01:17:48,639
Stacey has been fully committed to providing the very best for our students.

132
01:17:49,399 --> 01:17:53,720
Her presentation provided great information for all in attendance.

133
01:17:55,860 --> 01:18:07,142
I would like to also say that the Mustang Physical Education Department has received a Project HERE grant from the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office.

134
01:18:08,482 --> 01:18:11,943
The grant will be used to teach physical education teachers

135
01:18:12,643 --> 01:18:15,025
the sport of archery in June.

136
01:18:15,885 --> 01:18:20,809
It will be added to our curriculum for the 23-24 school year.

137
01:18:21,629 --> 01:18:34,758
Additionally, the physical education department is pleased to announce that it will be adding a unified physical education class to the high school electives for the 23-24 school year.

138
01:18:35,678 --> 01:18:38,700
So I'm very pleased with that new addition for next school year.

139
01:18:40,345 --> 01:18:56,050
I'd like to let the community know that on Monday, March 27, the McGlynn Middle School will once again host screenagers, the next chapter, in the school auditorium from 6.15 to 7.30 p.m.

140
01:18:56,690 --> 01:19:02,732
So there will be a second showing of screenagers for families that were not able to attend the first showing.

141
01:19:04,492 --> 01:19:10,956
Next Thursday, March 30th, is our final Building Bridges to Kindergarten presentation.

142
01:19:11,537 --> 01:19:16,440
It will be presented at the high school library from 6.30 to 7.30 p.m.

143
01:19:17,161 --> 01:19:17,921
All are welcome.

144
01:19:18,522 --> 01:19:25,546
Again, this is for incoming kindergarten students that will be joining Medford Public Schools in the fall.

145
01:19:26,847 --> 01:19:31,475
Also, our Parent Information Center will remain open until 6 p.m.

146
01:19:31,996 --> 01:19:37,345
for any parents or caregivers to support them with their student registration needs.

147
01:19:39,201 --> 01:19:43,923
I want to recognize our spotlight productions that just took place.

148
01:19:45,263 --> 01:19:48,084
Wonderful, wonderful production of Annie Jr.

149
01:19:49,365 --> 01:19:53,526
I heard the students singing and practicing and they sounded absolutely fabulous.

150
01:19:54,767 --> 01:19:56,067
All the shows were wonderful.

151
01:19:56,347 --> 01:19:57,688
It ended this past weekend.

152
01:19:58,989 --> 01:20:04,212
I want the community to know that another presentation production is coming next weekend.

153
01:20:04,952 --> 01:20:17,541
That production is going to be Beauty and the Beast, and it will begin on Thursday, March 30, Friday the 31st, and on Saturday, April 1, there will be two shows, a 2 p.m.

154
01:20:17,561 --> 01:20:18,061
and a 7 p.m.

155
01:20:19,802 --> 01:20:21,923
I will also put that in my weekly update.

156
01:20:22,324 --> 01:20:36,472
Tickets went on sale today via Eventbrite, and I want you to know that many of our high school students are part of the cast, so it definitely will be a wonderful opportunity to support Spotlight Productions.

157
01:20:37,953 --> 01:20:54,828
I also want to recognize our Brooks 4th and 5th grade CCSR students that are leading a community headstone cleaning event for the graves of Medford's Korean war veterans at Oak Grove Cemetery on Patriots Day.

158
01:20:55,789 --> 01:20:59,651
That will be taking place on April 17th at 1230 p.m.

159
01:21:00,591 --> 01:21:04,653
They are hoping that many in our community will come out to join and support them.

160
01:21:05,573 --> 01:21:09,015
It should take about 45 minutes to clean a marker.

161
01:21:10,255 --> 01:21:12,276
The more hands that are available, the better.

162
01:21:12,296 --> 01:21:21,440
And I will continue to advertise that, but I just wanted people to know, save the date if you would like to support a community event.

163
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:24,282
Mr. Coats at the Brooks School.

164
01:21:24,502 --> 01:21:33,610
His email is mcoats, m-c-o-a-t-e-s, at medford.k12.ma.us.

165
01:21:34,170 --> 01:21:39,194
Please email him by April 6th if you would like to participate.

166
01:21:41,012 --> 01:21:50,236
I would also be remiss if I did not mention that this coming Wednesday at sundown is the beginning of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.

167
01:21:50,936 --> 01:22:04,782
During this month, Muslim members of the community fast from pre-sunrise to sunset in the hopes of achieving greater consciousness of God, wishing our Muslim families a peaceful Ramadan.

168
01:22:05,823 --> 01:22:06,663
So in closing,

169
01:22:08,254 --> 01:22:13,038
Spring officially began today on this beautiful day at 5.24 p.m.

170
01:22:13,999 --> 01:22:16,181
And tomorrow is World Poetry Day.

171
01:22:17,102 --> 01:22:25,168
So I would like to close with this very short poem from an English poet, Robert Browning's poem about spring.

172
01:22:26,690 --> 01:22:30,453
The years at the spring and days at the moon.

173
01:22:31,694 --> 01:22:32,975
Mornings at seven.

174
01:22:34,298 --> 01:22:36,459
The hillsides do cold.

175
01:22:37,759 --> 01:22:39,259
The locks on the wing.

176
01:22:40,199 --> 01:22:41,900
The snails on the thorn.

177
01:22:43,100 --> 01:22:44,580
God's in his heaven.

178
01:22:46,041 --> 01:22:47,721
All's right with the world.

179
01:22:48,401 --> 01:22:48,862
Thank you.

180
01:22:51,382 --> 01:22:52,983
Thank you, Dr. Edward Vincent.

181
01:22:56,143 --> 01:22:57,784
Next we have report on science.

182
01:22:58,304 --> 01:23:01,245
Mr. Rocco Sieri, director of science K through 12.

183
01:23:02,165 --> 01:23:03,165
First up, recommendation

184
01:23:03,683 --> 01:23:07,385
We have two recommendations for approval of donations to the Science Department.

185
01:23:07,606 --> 01:23:12,089
First, to support the Medford High School Vocational School Science Engineering Fair.

186
01:23:12,749 --> 01:23:18,573
And the second, to the Science and Mathematics Department, to the J.S.

187
01:23:18,733 --> 01:23:20,794
Lim Prizes in Mathematics and Science.

188
01:23:21,135 --> 01:23:21,655
Mr. Seary.

189
01:23:39,005 --> 01:23:46,951
vocational, technical, high school science and engineering fair that will be held on Thursday, April 13th throughout the school day.

190
01:23:47,651 --> 01:23:50,213
The donation is being made by Mabbitt and Associates.

191
01:23:50,754 --> 01:23:57,579
The following is the breakdown in funding that was proposed to Mabbitt and Associates and being acceptable for donation.

192
01:23:58,619 --> 01:24:00,260
We will have first and third prizes.

193
01:24:02,250 --> 01:24:08,095
given to students and eight honorable mentions, totaling $1,000 together.

194
01:24:08,115 --> 01:24:18,624
A collation for the judges that will be present to support students for 890, and then the entry fee for the regional fair that the students participated in at 110.

195
01:24:19,625 --> 01:24:21,126
So in total, it's $2,000.

196
01:24:22,928 --> 01:24:29,874
Mabbitt and Associates was founded by the Medford High School 1965 graduate alumnus, Arthur Mabbitt,

197
01:24:30,649 --> 01:24:33,631
In addition to being a graduate of Medford High School, he's a U.S.

198
01:24:33,691 --> 01:24:41,037
Armed Services veteran, bravely served our nation for over 19 years in active service and in the Army Reserves.

199
01:24:41,497 --> 01:24:49,243
Mabbitt & Associates is a leading provider of environmental consulting, health and safety, architectural and engineering design services nationwide.

200
01:24:49,943 --> 01:24:56,949
Mabbitt & Associates is making this generous donation to our students, and I'd like to recommend that the school committee accept the donation.

201
01:24:59,310 --> 01:24:59,931
Motion to approve?

202
01:25:00,919 --> 01:25:04,081
Motion for approval by Member Graham, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

203
01:25:04,681 --> 01:25:05,482
All those in favor?

204
01:25:05,502 --> 01:25:06,402
Aye.

205
01:25:06,462 --> 01:25:07,203
All those opposed?

206
01:25:08,303 --> 01:25:09,544
Motion passes unanimously.

207
01:25:09,624 --> 01:25:11,025
Thank you for the donation, Mr. Mabbitt.

208
01:25:12,185 --> 01:25:12,586
Thank you.

209
01:25:13,506 --> 01:25:19,910
I'm going to invite my colleague Faiza Khan, Director of Mathematics, for the next request.

210
01:25:21,933 --> 01:25:35,976
Dear members of the school committee, the following report is to apprise you of a donation of $3,000 to cover expenses for the 2024 MHS MVETH J. Limb Science and Mathematics prizes.

211
01:25:36,197 --> 01:25:39,017
The donation is being made by the J. Limb Foundation.

212
01:25:39,677 --> 01:25:42,958
Following is the breakdown proposed by the Limb Foundation.

213
01:25:43,358 --> 01:25:48,920
There's a mathematics prize to the student of $1,000, a science prize to the student of $1,000,

214
01:25:50,620 --> 01:25:55,564
And then there's a award plaque collation and presentation for $1,000.

215
01:25:55,764 --> 01:26:07,033
The mathematics and science prizes will be announced this year for awarding at a school award ceremony in the next school year, May 2024.

216
01:26:08,014 --> 01:26:10,696
So we announced it this year that this award is available.

217
01:26:11,147 --> 01:26:19,812
Next year, the student is selected from that junior class following the criteria that I'm gonna announce in a moment.

218
01:26:21,352 --> 01:26:25,254
And then we present the students with the award.

219
01:26:25,655 --> 01:26:27,396
The following criteria will be used.

220
01:26:28,136 --> 01:26:36,240
The student has to be enrolled in the highest level courses possible available to grade 11 students in the respective discipline, whether it's mathematics or science.

221
01:26:36,641 --> 01:26:39,282
The student's average must be in the top 5% of the class.

222
01:26:39,966 --> 01:26:41,467
for the respective discipline.

223
01:26:41,487 --> 01:26:53,932
The student will have been endorsed by their current teacher in the discipline, and the student will also have received endorsements from at least two members of the faculty of the respective discipline by vote at a department meeting.

224
01:26:55,012 --> 01:27:00,995
The student can only receive one of the two awards, so it goes to two separate students for the year.

225
01:27:02,885 --> 01:27:08,307
Jay Lim was an MIT professor of electrical engineering and computer science.

226
01:27:08,347 --> 01:27:11,948
He worked in the area of television systems and signal compression.

227
01:27:12,368 --> 01:27:13,688
He holds over 40 U.S.

228
01:27:13,748 --> 01:27:15,129
patents in the field.

229
01:27:15,889 --> 01:27:24,352
The JS Lim Foundation was established in 2010 and has funded a number of endowments, chaired professorships, and graduate fellowships.

230
01:27:24,412 --> 01:27:24,932
In addition,

231
01:27:25,936 --> 01:27:28,917
The JLM Foundation is to help U.S.

232
01:27:28,957 --> 01:27:35,239
students reach their full potential in these subjects through grants to schools and educational organizations.

233
01:27:35,860 --> 01:27:42,902
The JLM Foundation is making this generous donation to our students, and I'd like to recommend that the school committee accept the donation.

234
01:27:43,882 --> 01:27:44,163
Thank you.

235
01:27:45,663 --> 01:27:48,584
Motion to approve by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Graham.

236
01:27:48,844 --> 01:27:49,544
All those in favor?

237
01:27:50,105 --> 01:27:50,225
Aye.

238
01:27:50,465 --> 01:27:51,245
All those opposed?

239
01:27:51,925 --> 01:27:52,846
Donation is accepted.

240
01:27:53,526 --> 01:27:53,666
Great.

241
01:27:54,565 --> 01:27:54,985
Thank you.

242
01:27:55,205 --> 01:27:55,445
Yes.

243
01:27:55,525 --> 01:27:55,846
Thank you.

244
01:27:55,906 --> 01:28:05,549
We're onto number C. We have report and acknowledgement of achievement of Medford high school students at the region for science and engineering fair held at Tufts university.

245
01:28:07,510 --> 01:28:16,694
On Friday, March 3rd, um, 2023 11 high school, uh, Medford high school students participated in the region for science and engineering fair at Tufts university.

246
01:28:17,580 --> 01:28:19,962
Our students represented our school very well.

247
01:28:20,803 --> 01:28:26,889
We had one overall award presented to students as well as several recognition awards for their projects.

248
01:28:27,569 --> 01:28:35,396
Owen Liao, Dan Khoi Nguyen, and Vina Lee placed 13th overall at the fair and received the Tufts University Science Fair Prize of $250.

249
01:28:35,456 --> 01:28:40,141
The other students received recognition awards from Starbucks.

250
01:28:41,639 --> 01:28:50,827
And in order to participate, students need to submit a research proposal for approval, as well as carry out research and register for the fair once the project is approved.

251
01:28:51,568 --> 01:29:00,356
Participation represents a multi-step process that's done voluntarily by these students outside the time of the curriculum at MHS.

252
01:29:01,357 --> 01:29:06,021
Students are both encouraged and supported by their classroom science teachers to move forward with the projects.

253
01:29:06,618 --> 01:29:07,960
and participate in the event.

254
01:29:08,401 --> 01:29:15,931
But I want to especially mention Dr. Warnes, the physics teacher at Medford High, who encouraged the participation of many of these students.

255
01:29:18,454 --> 01:29:20,758
I also should mention that they haven't had an in-person

256
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:25,484
science fair events since 2019 at the regional level or the state level.

257
01:29:25,524 --> 01:29:29,407
So this was the first one that these students could have ever participated in.

258
01:29:30,188 --> 01:29:38,076
I'm really proud that the students took on this particular challenge and registered early, did their projects early.

259
01:29:38,856 --> 01:29:47,084
As you can see, we've decoupled our fair from the regional fair to be a much more inclusive fair at our level, allow many more students to participate.

260
01:29:47,504 --> 01:29:53,787
and if students want to participate in the regional fair, they have this sort of accelerated path to be able to participate in that fair.

261
01:29:55,528 --> 01:29:57,829
So many of them are here tonight.

262
01:29:57,929 --> 01:30:10,195
Some had other obligations, so they couldn't make it, but I'm really excited to be able to have them receive certificates of recognition from the school committee this evening for their achievements.

263
01:30:19,404 --> 01:30:22,685
When you hear your name being said, first congratulations to all of you.

264
01:30:25,666 --> 01:30:28,347
Please come on up and we will shake your hand.

265
01:30:29,988 --> 01:30:31,128
Clay Canavan.

266
01:30:34,389 --> 01:30:34,889
Not present.

267
01:30:43,532 --> 01:30:44,612
Julie Desotel.

268
01:31:16,986 --> 01:31:19,268
Rakshita Shankar Ganesh.

269
01:31:41,148 --> 01:31:42,670
Hopefully we can hear about a project or two.

270
01:31:45,052 --> 01:31:46,573
if there's any public speakers in the room.

271
01:32:19,103 --> 01:32:20,216
Dena Lee.

272
01:32:58,732 --> 01:33:00,093
Ding Khoi Nguyen.

273
01:33:19,109 --> 01:33:19,990
Oprah McKellar.

274
01:33:44,215 --> 01:33:45,376
Morgan Reynolds.

275
01:33:45,396 --> 01:33:51,020
Congratulations.

276
01:34:08,485 --> 01:34:09,586
Mary Schmidt.

277
01:34:18,810 --> 01:34:20,211
Charlotte Yanamoto.

278
01:34:27,155 --> 01:34:29,616
Can we get one of you to tell us about your project?

279
01:34:33,358 --> 01:34:34,579
Any takers, any takers?

280
01:34:37,793 --> 01:34:38,513
Come and share.

281
01:34:38,813 --> 01:34:39,633
Oh, fabulous.

282
01:34:39,674 --> 01:34:40,694
Hey, there we go.

283
01:34:40,754 --> 01:34:51,297
Thank you.

284
01:34:52,377 --> 01:34:53,217
Wait, okay.

285
01:34:54,117 --> 01:35:01,699
So our project, we built a Lego robot to see if you can measure things using probability.

286
01:35:03,660 --> 01:35:04,120
Anything else?

287
01:35:04,831 --> 01:35:16,722
We did the project last year, but we wanted to improve and so this time we did it with a robot to see if we can like standardize randomness and like use it to our advantage.

288
01:35:16,762 --> 01:35:16,942
Yeah.

289
01:35:24,086 --> 01:35:40,780
Well, for like the application of our project, for real world applications, we were thinking about on a lot like a really smaller scale, physicists can use this similar type of experiment to measure the size of small particles.

290
01:35:41,141 --> 01:35:46,185
We just did that on a larger scale so that it's observable and easier to experiment with.

291
01:35:52,512 --> 01:35:54,135
Wonderful, congratulations to all.

292
01:35:54,175 --> 01:35:55,097
We're very proud of you.

293
01:35:55,298 --> 01:35:57,723
And I think everybody wants to take a picture with you.

294
01:35:58,063 --> 01:35:59,446
Amazing students.

295
01:35:59,506 --> 01:36:00,228
So come on up.

296
01:36:01,230 --> 01:36:02,192
We're just gonna go right here.

297
01:37:31,761 --> 01:37:35,825
Next up, we have a presentation about Medford Public Schools Unified Arts.

298
01:37:36,365 --> 01:37:36,545
Ms.

299
01:37:36,565 --> 01:37:40,289
Haley Rello, Coordinator of Performing Arts, and Ms.

300
01:37:40,309 --> 01:37:42,330
Suzanne Fee, Coordinator of Fine Arts.

301
01:37:42,691 --> 01:37:42,991
Welcome.

302
01:37:48,732 --> 01:37:52,495
Good evening, everyone, Madam Mayor, Superintendent Edivar-Vincent, and school committee.

303
01:37:52,835 --> 01:37:56,178
We are thrilled to be up here to keep this happy, positive ball rolling this evening.

304
01:37:56,658 --> 01:38:00,501
So we'll be presenting on our Visual and Performing Arts program.

305
01:38:00,521 --> 01:38:01,602
So first, we have Fine Arts.

306
01:38:02,782 --> 01:38:03,663
I'm Suzanne Fee.

307
01:38:03,723 --> 01:38:05,264
I'm the coordinator of fine arts.

308
01:38:05,324 --> 01:38:06,826
I stepped into the role in July.

309
01:38:06,926 --> 01:38:12,071
And prior to that, I was the art teacher at the McGlynn Middle School for many, many years.

310
01:38:12,231 --> 01:38:15,414
And I'm excited to be in this new role.

311
01:38:15,454 --> 01:38:23,481
And one of the best parts about the role is sharing what our children are doing and making with the community.

312
01:38:23,641 --> 01:38:27,865
So with that, I'd like to give you a little update about things we've done this year.

313
01:38:28,746 --> 01:38:32,189
I think it's safe to say we hit the ground running when we stepped into our roles in July.

314
01:38:33,490 --> 01:38:52,445
Just as a review, our staff, all our elementary schools have a full-time art teacher, each middle school has a full-time art teacher, and the high school has two full-time art teachers, but we also have two teachers outside of the department teaching some two credit art courses, and I teach two courses at the high school level as well.

315
01:38:54,607 --> 01:38:58,246
So just to review some new and notable things that we've done this year.

316
01:39:00,318 --> 01:39:09,580
The National Art Honor Society, we established a chapter for the first time at the high school level, and we have 22 members this year.

317
01:39:10,240 --> 01:39:20,382
One of the great things about a National Art Honor Society is that one of the requirements is that you have to do 15 hours of art-based community service.

318
01:39:20,602 --> 01:39:25,063
So we have some students going into Kids' Corner and doing craft activities.

319
01:39:25,583 --> 01:39:30,944
We have kids donating artwork to waiting rooms and offices.

320
01:39:31,104 --> 01:39:38,206
We have some kids doing something called the Art Abandonment Project, where you leave a small piece of art for someone to take home and enjoy.

321
01:39:38,326 --> 01:39:41,807
And we have a lot of other projects going on.

322
01:39:41,867 --> 01:39:44,828
So that's been a great addition to the school community.

323
01:39:45,128 --> 01:39:47,329
It's also a really nice way for kids who

324
01:39:48,869 --> 01:39:50,872
aren't able to take an art course every year.

325
01:39:51,052 --> 01:40:00,743
If you have taken an art course in the past, or you plan to in the future, you can still be in the National Art Honor Society, as long as you're the proper grade level is maintained.

326
01:40:00,763 --> 01:40:02,786
So it's a nice way to keep students in the arts.

327
01:40:04,441 --> 01:40:12,090
This past month, I received grant funding to acquire supplies for students to create murals at various schools in the district.

328
01:40:12,791 --> 01:40:19,478
And also, the funds will be used to do some other student-directed visual improvements at the high school.

329
01:40:20,768 --> 01:40:29,535
And so that National Art Honor Society students are using some of those funds to do mural projects for teachers in their classroom and around the school.

330
01:40:29,976 --> 01:40:34,540
So it's been nice to have that cache of supplies that we can use.

331
01:40:36,229 --> 01:40:46,331
The online art gallery just got uploaded to the district website, and there's a separate gallery for each school in the district.

332
01:40:47,071 --> 01:40:58,654
And so each school's page has an art gallery, and then the fine arts page has the gallery of every school, and that will be getting updated and get new content as the year goes on.

333
01:40:58,754 --> 01:41:03,775
And we're really excited about being able to share the artwork with the community that way.

334
01:41:05,157 --> 01:41:23,761
And we had two, Mrs. Miller in web design at the vocational school and two of her senior students, Kevin Guzmo and Vibhav Saini were really instrumental in working with me to design the page and teach me how to upload the artwork and stuff.

335
01:41:23,781 --> 01:41:26,381
So it wouldn't have been possible without them.

336
01:41:26,401 --> 01:41:28,702
And it was really nice to have that student involvement.

337
01:41:31,409 --> 01:41:45,908
One of the first initiatives that I dove into the past summer was getting approved to be a site location for Lesley University art therapy students to conduct internships with us.

338
01:41:48,732 --> 01:41:56,937
Our main focus was to try to get a second year art therapy intern at the Curtis Tufts to work with our students.

339
01:41:57,718 --> 01:42:09,204
It didn't work out for this school year, we kind of applied too late, but we have a wonderful candidate lined up to join us at the Curtis Tufts from September to May and she's going to do some

340
01:42:10,485 --> 01:42:13,907
art therapy and small group, individual and whole group.

341
01:42:13,987 --> 01:42:18,168
And I think it's a great addition to that school.

342
01:42:18,188 --> 01:42:19,469
So I'm really excited about that.

343
01:42:20,909 --> 01:42:25,711
We've had various guest speakers this year at each level.

344
01:42:26,392 --> 01:42:34,215
At the elementary level, we had author and illustrator Barney Salzberg do a virtual Zoom with

345
01:42:37,196 --> 01:42:43,862
all elementary schools, and that was thanks to Jen Belandra, the art teacher at the McGlynn Elementary.

346
01:42:44,382 --> 01:42:59,574
He did an interactive Zoom, and he was able to look at some kids' artwork, and he talked about his process, and it was all based on his book, Beautiful Oops, which talks about how you could make art from mistakes and

347
01:43:00,755 --> 01:43:04,597
It was a great experience for all our elementary students to enjoy.

348
01:43:04,617 --> 01:43:09,639
At the middle school level, we had a professor of animation from MassArt.

349
01:43:09,679 --> 01:43:21,624
He's also a Medford Public Schools parent, Jesse Strauss, come in and talk to students about the process of animating and how to develop your story.

350
01:43:22,884 --> 01:43:37,343
And then at the high school level, UMass Lowell professor of graphic design and illustration came to talk to some art students, as well as the students in the graphic design program about some options at UMass Lowell.

351
01:43:37,723 --> 01:43:41,048
And she also joined the graphic design advisory committee this year.

352
01:43:44,025 --> 01:43:52,047
We're working with Susan Altman on the community mural mosaic project, which is going to be hung outside of Medford High.

353
01:43:52,527 --> 01:44:00,369
And we have had students from virtually every school in the district collaborating and working on the project with us.

354
01:44:00,389 --> 01:44:05,790
And we still have a ways to go, but it should be slated to be finished by the end of the school year.

355
01:44:07,074 --> 01:44:15,055
and I'm gonna share a mock-up of the design that was designed by three different students at the high school.

356
01:44:17,256 --> 01:44:19,616
And so we hope to have that finished by the end of the year.

357
01:44:23,017 --> 01:44:23,237
Ms.

358
01:44:23,257 --> 01:44:28,878
Arello and I also started our bi-monthly fine and performing arts newsletter called Color and Chords.

359
01:44:29,558 --> 01:44:34,379
The next issue will be coming soon, but you can find our back issues on the district website.

360
01:44:36,158 --> 01:44:49,045
We had a library display at Medford High that was really successful, and it was really a nice opportunity for students to see their work hung and framed professionally, and we'll be displaying there next year as well.

361
01:44:50,806 --> 01:44:54,889
We just started a photography club at Medford High, and Ms.

362
01:44:54,989 --> 01:45:02,033
Van Aken is going to be doing a photography contest and show later in the spring, and we have some professional photographers lined up to jury that show.

363
01:45:05,723 --> 01:45:11,488
Book Wonder and Medford Arts Council, thanks to them, there'll be an inclusive, diverse art library in Ms.

364
01:45:11,508 --> 01:45:13,069
Mazeka's classroom at the Missituck.

365
01:45:14,670 --> 01:45:18,253
The Roberts and the McGlynn Elementary have art shows coming up in the next few weeks.

366
01:45:18,353 --> 01:45:18,533
Ms.

367
01:45:18,553 --> 01:45:19,173
Shanley, Ms.

368
01:45:19,193 --> 01:45:26,839
Belanger and their PTOs have worked to receive grant funding to help defray some of the cost of mounting and displaying and hanging the artwork.

369
01:45:27,279 --> 01:45:28,520
Those are gonna be great shows.

370
01:45:28,640 --> 01:45:31,222
I think they're both in early May.

371
01:45:34,056 --> 01:45:44,185
The Fine Arts Hall of Fame has been in existence at the McGlynn Middle School for the past five years, and we're gonna expand that to the Andrews Middle School this year, and hopefully to other schools in the following year.

372
01:45:47,008 --> 01:45:57,758
Lastly, eight of our students have won Scholastic Art Awards this year, which I think is the most we've ever received in a single year, and we have a student who has been nominated for a National Award, so that's really exciting.

373
01:45:59,554 --> 01:46:09,196
And just really quickly looking forward to 2023 and 2024 school year, we're excited to be working with Mr. Fallon, Ms.

374
01:46:09,236 --> 01:46:16,458
Fitzpatrick and Mr. DeLeva to combine the arts into the CTE rotation for freshmen.

375
01:46:17,178 --> 01:46:23,960
It's a pilot program and we're excited to build the connection between the vocational school and our arts programs.

376
01:46:24,898 --> 01:46:25,078
Ms.

377
01:46:25,098 --> 01:46:40,713
Rallo and I would like to plan some sort of arts week or arts month next school year that would be dedicated to showcasing student artwork in various locations throughout the district in tandem with some music and performance events as well.

378
01:46:40,733 --> 01:46:42,215
So we'd like to try to coordinate that.

379
01:46:44,244 --> 01:46:49,046
We have a new photography course being offered at the high school this year for the first time in a while.

380
01:46:49,867 --> 01:46:51,487
And I'm thrilled about that.

381
01:46:52,288 --> 01:46:54,309
It's kind of been a void in our program.

382
01:46:54,829 --> 01:47:00,331
Virtually every school in the surrounding communities and similar districts do offer some photography courses.

383
01:47:00,392 --> 01:47:07,355
So we're starting with a digital photography course, and then hopefully in years to come, we can expand that to film photography.

384
01:47:08,496 --> 01:47:10,638
And we also have a new art history course.

385
01:47:11,258 --> 01:47:14,440
It's an art history and drawing course that's going to be offered as well.

386
01:47:16,041 --> 01:47:31,953
And lastly, just looking towards next year, I wanna try to increase community collaboration, pulling in some more of our, the city is full of professionals and artists who I'm sure are willing to share their expertise and real world knowledge with our students.

387
01:47:31,973 --> 01:47:34,795
So I wanna sort of explore that a little bit more.

388
01:47:35,854 --> 01:47:44,501
I'm working with Arts Collaborative in Medford and hopefully we can develop a partnership so they can provide some meaningful art opportunities for our students outside of school.

389
01:47:46,682 --> 01:47:50,545
And lastly, I wanna try to build some connections between our artists across grade levels.

390
01:47:50,605 --> 01:47:56,310
So maybe our high school art clubs and middle school art clubs can collaborate and do some stuff together.

391
01:47:56,470 --> 01:48:02,515
I think that would be nice to continue to foster that love of arts for our younger students.

392
01:48:03,717 --> 01:48:05,057
So that's it, I'm gonna turn it over to Ms.

393
01:48:05,097 --> 01:48:06,838
Rallo about performing arts.

394
01:48:08,279 --> 01:48:09,039
And before you, Ms.

395
01:48:09,099 --> 01:48:15,381
Rallo, before you start, I know we have a student spotlight, I see it in your presentation.

396
01:48:15,401 --> 01:48:15,461
Yes.

397
01:48:15,621 --> 01:48:16,622
He's here tonight.

398
01:48:17,362 --> 01:48:19,222
I already took his picture for the next day.

399
01:48:19,282 --> 01:48:20,703
Yes, our student rep.

400
01:48:22,043 --> 01:48:23,104
So I had to point that out.

401
01:48:24,664 --> 01:48:25,205
Great job.

402
01:48:30,847 --> 01:48:31,967
All right, so for performing arts,

403
01:48:33,440 --> 01:48:36,782
We really focused this year on three main factors.

404
01:48:36,842 --> 01:48:42,025
We embraced performance opportunities, we enhanced equipment needs, and we upgraded our facilities.

405
01:48:42,806 --> 01:48:50,030
So when looking at our... You have a copy of this in front of you, right?

406
01:48:50,591 --> 01:48:51,071
Okay, perfect.

407
01:48:51,091 --> 01:48:52,952
It wasn't on the screen.

408
01:48:54,633 --> 01:48:54,993
That's all right.

409
01:48:55,834 --> 01:48:58,215
So we started the year with our Jumpstart Music Camp in August.

410
01:48:58,976 --> 01:49:01,117
We had over 70 students participate in the camp this year.

411
01:49:01,584 --> 01:49:05,028
It's two weeks long with a performance at the end for all of our friends and family.

412
01:49:05,829 --> 01:49:09,833
Students worked in sectionals, had outdoor game and snack time, as well as ensemble time.

413
01:49:10,493 --> 01:49:14,678
And the wonderful thing is it's free to all Medford students entering grades four through eight, so.

414
01:49:15,279 --> 01:49:16,840
really tried to expand on that this summer.

415
01:49:17,260 --> 01:49:22,163
Last summer we had, the summer before, we had about around 50 students.

416
01:49:22,183 --> 01:49:25,045
So every time we enroll, we get more and more.

417
01:49:25,125 --> 01:49:27,647
So we're hoping to further that for the future.

418
01:49:28,968 --> 01:49:31,890
Then we moved into marching band, which went through August to October.

419
01:49:32,690 --> 01:49:36,052
This season, they attended five competitions and won nine trophies.

420
01:49:36,532 --> 01:49:40,435
They placed second at the New England Scholastic Band Association's championship finals.

421
01:49:41,207 --> 01:49:43,689
with a gold medal and best color guard for our division.

422
01:49:43,829 --> 01:49:45,170
So they worked really hard this season.

423
01:49:45,190 --> 01:49:45,870
They did really well.

424
01:49:47,431 --> 01:49:50,713
We moved into football games in October and November.

425
01:49:51,694 --> 01:49:53,575
This year, we got to go to Fenway Park.

426
01:49:54,076 --> 01:50:01,961
So the students got the opportunity to play the national anthem at Fenway, and they also got to play stand tunes during halftime, be seen on the big jumbotron.

427
01:50:01,981 --> 01:50:02,821
It was a big deal.

428
01:50:02,841 --> 01:50:03,822
We were really excited about it.

429
01:50:05,252 --> 01:50:07,353
From there, we moved into the fall play.

430
01:50:08,394 --> 01:50:09,755
We hadn't had a fall play since 2019.

431
01:50:09,795 --> 01:50:13,917
So we're really excited to bring this back after COVID.

432
01:50:13,997 --> 01:50:15,998
I know it's way too long, but it's okay.

433
01:50:16,078 --> 01:50:16,659
It all worked out.

434
01:50:17,279 --> 01:50:19,440
It was directed by our faculty advisor, Riley Jones.

435
01:50:20,041 --> 01:50:21,741
The students put on a really great production.

436
01:50:21,782 --> 01:50:25,884
They had a lot of fun and it was really nice to see some theater going on in our theater again.

437
01:50:26,844 --> 01:50:31,147
At the middle school and high school winter concerts, we head into that into December.

438
01:50:32,076 --> 01:50:41,949
They featured our six through 12 band and orchestra programs, so they were able to highlight the middle school and high school ensembles.

439
01:50:42,670 --> 01:50:46,976
We get to recognize our seniors and it's our last winter concert, so we get to kind of

440
01:50:47,483 --> 01:50:48,384
know, move through that.

441
01:50:49,644 --> 01:50:52,866
Moving on, we went to elementary winter concert, which is in January.

442
01:50:53,267 --> 01:50:57,849
This featured our fifth grade strings, our select fifth grade band, and our Roberts hand chimes.

443
01:50:58,790 --> 01:51:03,453
This is the very first time our fifth grade band ever got to perform in a winter concert.

444
01:51:03,633 --> 01:51:13,679
Usually they work all year and perform the spring, but now that last year was the first year piloting our fourth grade band program, we now have a second year of elementary school band

445
01:51:14,159 --> 01:51:19,963
it's a little bit more advanced, no longer beginners, so we threw this challenge at them and we had a bunch of students come play.

446
01:51:20,003 --> 01:51:31,172
Some students got up and played solos, some of them played one piece at the end of the concert together, so they worked really hard and it was a big milestone for us to get that first elementary winter fan concert out there.

447
01:51:32,967 --> 01:51:35,148
We brought back elementary assemblies.

448
01:51:36,029 --> 01:51:37,649
We hadn't had those since pre-COVID.

449
01:51:38,770 --> 01:51:40,091
The students were really excited.

450
01:51:41,071 --> 01:51:49,455
We hadn't had a chance to get them all in the gym singing and making music together and playing instruments and showcasing and showing their peers what they've been working on.

451
01:51:49,875 --> 01:51:51,016
So they were really excited about that.

452
01:51:51,056 --> 01:51:53,357
There was some dancing, there were some orphan instruments.

453
01:51:54,137 --> 01:51:56,298
There was lots of different exciting things.

454
01:51:56,318 --> 01:52:00,180
So they did those at the elementary schools between November and February.

455
01:52:01,764 --> 01:52:06,449
We're moving on to our Modern Music Ensemble, which is a class at the high school level that Ms.

456
01:52:06,489 --> 01:52:07,149
Farr teaches.

457
01:52:08,190 --> 01:52:14,056
They got to perform this year at MMEA, which is the Massachusetts Music Educators Association.

458
01:52:14,957 --> 01:52:16,638
So they were chosen to go perform there.

459
01:52:16,658 --> 01:52:23,605
In addition, Andrew Soule's original composition was recognized by MMEA's Contemporary Creators Festival.

460
01:52:24,525 --> 01:52:35,673
All seven students participated in a composition and songwriting forum that included feedback on Andrew's work from composition and songwriting professors from Berkeley, UMass Lowell, and Boston Conservatory.

461
01:52:35,773 --> 01:52:37,614
So they got to kind of break down his work.

462
01:52:37,654 --> 01:52:39,395
The students got to perform it.

463
01:52:39,415 --> 01:52:40,416
They had a really good time.

464
01:52:41,316 --> 01:52:42,897
I think they all caught the performance bug.

465
01:52:42,957 --> 01:52:48,221
So for some of them, they had never performed in front of people before, because it's a class during the day.

466
01:52:48,441 --> 01:52:51,543
It's not a performance, necessarily a performance-based class.

467
01:52:52,948 --> 01:52:54,932
they kind of got to get up and perform.

468
01:52:54,952 --> 01:52:59,802
And now some of them are looking for more opportunities and they're really excited because they really, really enjoyed it.

469
01:52:59,822 --> 01:52:59,862
So.

470
01:53:02,072 --> 01:53:06,893
Jayden Veal was selected to perform with the Northeast Junior District Orchestra.

471
01:53:07,293 --> 01:53:09,914
So Jayden is a freshman violinist at Medford High School.

472
01:53:10,374 --> 01:53:13,735
He auditioned and was selected from hundreds of students across the district to participate.

473
01:53:14,595 --> 01:53:17,996
The district orchestra has performed at Galvin Middle School in Wakefield, Mass.

474
01:53:18,016 --> 01:53:18,776
this past weekend.

475
01:53:19,276 --> 01:53:20,296
So congrats to Jayden.

476
01:53:20,356 --> 01:53:21,336
It's really exciting.

477
01:53:21,597 --> 01:53:23,217
Giving a little rep to Medford.

478
01:53:24,790 --> 01:53:26,512
And that's kind of our performance opportunities.

479
01:53:26,853 --> 01:53:29,096
So looking at enhancing our equipment needs.

480
01:53:30,077 --> 01:53:33,041
We also moved on to that to do some upgrades.

481
01:53:33,061 --> 01:53:38,669
So we got some new computers in the high school music tech lab from Tufts University prior to

482
01:53:40,271 --> 01:53:45,916
Prior to this year, we had 10 computers, so the class is maxed out at 20 students.

483
01:53:45,956 --> 01:53:50,659
We had two students sharing one computer, but now we actually have 20 computers.

484
01:53:50,719 --> 01:53:57,405
Now every student has their own keyboard, has their own computer, and can kind of work on their own projects, which is really great to expand that.

485
01:53:58,612 --> 01:54:00,913
We ordered some new keyboards for the McGlynn Middle School.

486
01:54:01,234 --> 01:54:03,255
Last year, the Andrews got keyboard updates.

487
01:54:03,275 --> 01:54:05,116
So this year, McGlynn got keyboard updates.

488
01:54:06,117 --> 01:54:08,738
We got some new ukuleles for the Brooks Elementary School.

489
01:54:08,919 --> 01:54:09,059
Ms.

490
01:54:09,079 --> 01:54:10,500
Turner does a ukulele program there.

491
01:54:11,020 --> 01:54:13,982
So we ordered some additional ones so that students don't have to share equipment.

492
01:54:14,322 --> 01:54:15,743
We can have extra resources.

493
01:54:16,984 --> 01:54:19,465
We did some new fourth and fifth grade string repairs.

494
01:54:19,925 --> 01:54:25,309
So we have a program where students in fourth and fifth grade can rent an instrument from the district instead of renting it from

495
01:54:26,520 --> 01:54:30,503
from an outside vendor so we can keep the cost down and provide more opportunities for students.

496
01:54:31,224 --> 01:54:37,289
But over the last few years, we have had a lot of repairs that needed to get done that haven't necessarily gotten done.

497
01:54:37,389 --> 01:54:43,534
So we jumped on that this year and started repairing them so we can have more instruments available for our students for next year.

498
01:54:44,515 --> 01:54:49,116
And we also received new touch view boards for general music classrooms.

499
01:54:49,156 --> 01:54:53,478
So now every general music classroom K through 12 has a touch view board.

500
01:54:54,558 --> 01:54:55,758
Two of them are already installed.

501
01:54:55,778 --> 01:54:59,879
The other ones are coming, but they'll be able to project on there.

502
01:54:59,919 --> 01:55:01,420
They can put class websites on there.

503
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:03,040
There are pens that come with them.

504
01:55:03,160 --> 01:55:07,061
So the students can compose music and they can draw and they can write on them.

505
01:55:07,862 --> 01:55:12,363
It's a great visual and music tool that we can use in the classroom.

506
01:55:12,691 --> 01:55:15,633
you can split the board so multiple students can work at them at the same time.

507
01:55:15,753 --> 01:55:24,577
So a lot of other classrooms in the district also received them this year, but there's some really cool music specific opportunities we can do with them.

508
01:55:24,597 --> 01:55:26,438
So we're excited to say we have one.

509
01:55:26,639 --> 01:55:29,200
We will have one by the end of this year in every general music classroom.

510
01:55:31,586 --> 01:55:38,348
Moving on to facility updates, we have a new guitar storage closet.

511
01:55:38,888 --> 01:55:49,611
So over quarantine, we purchased additional guitars so that every student taking guitar at the high school level could get a guitar dropped off at their house and they could play

512
01:55:50,131 --> 01:55:58,738
and practice and get the experience of taking the class online with an actual instrument, which meant we had a lot of additional instruments and not a lot of space.

513
01:55:58,998 --> 01:56:04,223
So luckily, Buildings and Grounds is able to build a nice guitar storage for us.

514
01:56:04,323 --> 01:56:06,404
We took part of a hallway and made that.

515
01:56:06,484 --> 01:56:08,346
So now we have enough space there.

516
01:56:08,366 --> 01:56:11,689
So now if students want to sign one out or bring one home, they're able to do so.

517
01:56:12,269 --> 01:56:14,391
And we can maintain them and keep them in a nice facility.

518
01:56:15,404 --> 01:56:21,607
We have a new arts workspace, our conflab lab, which is a place where both art and music can come and collaborate.

519
01:56:22,487 --> 01:56:27,770
The term conflab means to get together for an informal discussion to solve problems.

520
01:56:28,430 --> 01:56:31,131
So that's kind of our little lab to do that.

521
01:56:31,672 --> 01:56:38,955
We are able to work together, have a nice big space where we can kind of just collaborate and solve all the problems of the world through art and music.

522
01:56:40,322 --> 01:56:48,271
We have some new bulletin boards to showcase things like our new newsletter, some student updates, schedules, things to keep the students informed.

523
01:56:48,911 --> 01:56:49,112
Ms.

524
01:56:49,132 --> 01:56:51,254
Fard has a new gig board outside her classroom.

525
01:56:51,354 --> 01:57:02,386
So every time she gets word of a new gig or new opportunities for college or different things going on in the community, she can put it on there and the students can come by and they can grab something so they can look for some more.

526
01:57:02,813 --> 01:57:03,773
performance opportunities.

527
01:57:04,474 --> 01:57:05,454
That was a big thing this year.

528
01:57:05,534 --> 01:57:10,877
And we have some new lighting for our high school trophy case, which was built by Alex Lee, who's an alumni.

529
01:57:10,897 --> 01:57:15,319
It was his Eagle Scout project a few years ago, and it's in this really dark hallway.

530
01:57:15,379 --> 01:57:21,581
So we purchased some lighting for it to kind of fix it up and make it look really bright and shiny when you walk into by the theater.

531
01:57:21,601 --> 01:57:26,744
I don't think you can go on, Peter.

532
01:57:28,264 --> 01:57:28,585
There we go.

533
01:57:28,605 --> 01:57:31,686
There's Sarah in her new closet, really exciting.

534
01:57:35,020 --> 01:57:37,584
All right, so moving on to what's coming up.

535
01:57:37,664 --> 01:57:39,547
On the first, our winter guard finals.

536
01:57:40,168 --> 01:57:42,811
So our winter color guard is currently undefeated this year.

537
01:57:42,831 --> 01:57:46,276
This is the, I know it's really great, they're awesome.

538
01:57:48,850 --> 01:57:50,672
Their championship finals are on the first.

539
01:57:51,173 --> 01:58:00,621
This is the fifth year in a row they've been undefeated, so they're kind of a force to be reckoned with, and they're coming in hard for finals, so we're excited for them.

540
01:58:01,642 --> 01:58:06,607
The high school orchestra is also competing at MICA on that day, so busy day for us.

541
01:58:07,208 --> 01:58:12,313
On the 15th, the band is heading to Disney World, and they're performing in Disney World on the 15th.

542
01:58:13,293 --> 01:58:16,234
The 27th and 29th is the spring musical.

543
01:58:16,294 --> 01:58:18,535
They're doing Urinetown in the theater at the high school.

544
01:58:19,336 --> 01:58:24,077
On the 6th, the band and orchestra is going to compete in a music festival at Six Flags.

545
01:58:25,098 --> 01:58:27,659
May 3rd to 17th, there are spring concerts this year.

546
01:58:28,639 --> 01:58:32,620
And we just received a grant, so the Boston Saxophone Quartet is going to be coming.

547
01:58:33,721 --> 01:58:39,723
We got accepted to their Noteworthy Scholars Program, where they'll be coming in and they'll be doing two clinics with us and a performance.

548
01:58:40,003 --> 01:58:47,025
They're going to work with the students on things like intonation and improvisation, performance anxiety, all kinds of fun things.

549
01:58:47,105 --> 01:58:51,747
So we have those two clinics coming up, but they have not been put on the calendar yet.

550
01:58:53,955 --> 01:59:00,000
Looking forward to the future for the elementary level for next year.

551
01:59:00,040 --> 01:59:02,963
We're hoping to increase more performance opportunities.

552
01:59:03,744 --> 01:59:07,106
We're hoping to bring back the troublemakers chorus, which is grades two to five.

553
01:59:08,868 --> 01:59:14,753
We're hoping to collaborate with the school principals and increasing and adding musical guests for assemblies and music related field trips.

554
01:59:15,393 --> 01:59:20,017
All elementary school students used to take music field trips in the past, but those obviously were taken out due to COVID.

555
01:59:20,037 --> 01:59:20,878
So we're hoping to kind of

556
01:59:21,398 --> 01:59:22,939
work with the principals to get those back in.

557
01:59:22,959 --> 01:59:31,463
It was really fun to kind of teach the students about live performances and how to be a good audience member and get to take them places and show them live performances.

558
01:59:31,563 --> 01:59:33,944
So we're really hoping to get that, get that back.

559
01:59:34,864 --> 01:59:38,826
At the middle school level, we're also looking to increase performance opportunities.

560
01:59:39,246 --> 01:59:41,307
We're going to continue upgrading general music equipment.

561
01:59:41,527 --> 01:59:47,290
So in the last two years, the middle schools have received guitars, they received ukuleles, now they both have received keyboards.

562
01:59:47,830 --> 01:59:48,971
So we're working really hard to

563
01:59:49,551 --> 01:59:54,694
maintain what we have and also increase more opportunities as the students come up with more and more talent.

564
01:59:56,034 --> 02:00:02,838
We're also hoping to collaborate with the principals to bring back the chorus at the middle school level and also develop a visual and performing arts day.

565
02:00:02,918 --> 02:00:03,198
As Ms.

566
02:00:03,218 --> 02:00:10,382
Fee had kind of mentioned, we're really looking at showcasing what we have and how to get more students involved and show them how they can get involved.

567
02:00:10,462 --> 02:00:13,244
So at the high school level, we're looking for

568
02:00:14,588 --> 02:00:16,831
collaborating with principals to bring back the chorus again.

569
02:00:17,332 --> 02:00:18,713
We are currently in chorus lists.

570
02:00:19,534 --> 02:00:24,320
We're hoping to expand our theater program and we're looking to develop the visual performing arts day.

571
02:00:24,360 --> 02:00:28,886
So the high school will go down to the middle school and they'll work with them and it'd be a really good collaboration.

572
02:00:29,627 --> 02:00:30,769
As far as outside of school,

573
02:00:31,977 --> 02:00:33,078
hopes and dreams go.

574
02:00:33,458 --> 02:00:37,001
We're looking to expand the Jump Start Music Camp to provide more offerings.

575
02:00:37,842 --> 02:00:40,563
We're looking to bring the Drama Club back to Drama Fest.

576
02:00:41,064 --> 02:00:53,953
That's something that we used to do in the past where we would compete in a one-act play and get to work with other schools as part of METG, which is the Massachusetts Education Theater Association, sorry, Guild.

577
02:00:54,688 --> 02:01:01,170
And we got to go to clinics and the students could enter workshops and different contests.

578
02:01:01,210 --> 02:01:02,510
It was really exciting.

579
02:01:03,570 --> 02:01:06,831
And we're looking for more clinics and workshops for the instrumental students.

580
02:01:06,891 --> 02:01:12,993
So we used to bring in a lot of guests in the last few years, but obviously COVID kind of put a little damper on that.

581
02:01:13,013 --> 02:01:22,475
So we're looking at having some guest conductors come back in, some clinicians, some masterclasses, so that the students can really get into furthering their performing arts education.

582
02:01:24,360 --> 02:01:26,081
But you're welcome.

583
02:01:29,703 --> 02:01:30,304
Any questions?

584
02:01:31,144 --> 02:01:31,624
Member Graham?

585
02:01:33,385 --> 02:01:39,969
We were talking actually at the last meeting about theater not being part of the school day.

586
02:01:39,989 --> 02:01:43,231
And it sounds like that's on the plan for next year.

587
02:01:43,251 --> 02:01:43,532
Is that true?

588
02:01:43,632 --> 02:01:44,732
It is, fingers crossed.

589
02:01:44,752 --> 02:01:50,356
So we're hoping that theater will be one of the tracks that students will go through as part of the freshman exploratory class.

590
02:01:50,476 --> 02:01:53,498
And then further than that, as a sophomore,

591
02:01:54,378 --> 02:01:58,501
We need to bring back the intro to American musical theater class and the advanced technical theater class.

592
02:01:58,921 --> 02:02:05,747
So the intro to American musical theater class addressed all the performance, um, opportunities to students that wanted to be in the spotlight.

593
02:02:05,787 --> 02:02:11,991
They wanted to learn dancing and singing and improvisation and stage fighting and combat and all kinds of fun things.

594
02:02:12,552 --> 02:02:15,994
Um, and then we had the advanced technical theater class, which is for everyone who wanted to be behind the scenes.

595
02:02:16,435 --> 02:02:19,717
That was like stage craft and lighting and sound design and programming.

596
02:02:20,157 --> 02:02:20,758
So, um,

597
02:02:22,219 --> 02:02:28,241
make sure we had a class for both students, because they're different needs, but hopefully that will run for next year.

598
02:02:28,722 --> 02:02:35,805
And do we have teachers in our rank to do that now, or is that something that we'll have to prioritize at budget time?

599
02:02:36,525 --> 02:02:42,608
We currently don't have any teachers in the performing arts besides myself that are certified in theater education.

600
02:02:42,668 --> 02:02:42,788
Okay.

601
02:02:43,648 --> 02:02:43,968
Thank you.

602
02:02:43,988 --> 02:02:44,749
That's helpful.

603
02:02:45,649 --> 02:02:45,849
Thanks.

604
02:02:48,631 --> 02:02:49,091
Member Russo?

605
02:02:49,773 --> 02:02:50,133
Thank you.

606
02:02:50,753 --> 02:02:52,054
I'm very excited by photography.

607
02:02:52,114 --> 02:02:54,195
My daughter is very excited by photography.

608
02:02:54,215 --> 02:02:55,936
I hope that- Yeah, the students are all abuzz.

609
02:02:56,396 --> 02:02:57,476
Yes, all abuzz.

610
02:02:57,797 --> 02:03:11,222
And obviously photography is a little different now than when I was a student, but we're doing digital photography because, you know, the other stuff requires a lot.

611
02:03:11,423 --> 02:03:13,223
Yes.

612
02:03:13,443 --> 02:03:15,104
But will students be,

613
02:03:17,679 --> 02:03:20,861
required to bring their own equipment and what kind of equipment requirements will be there?

614
02:03:20,901 --> 02:03:31,247
So we're trying to get some digital cameras, but we've structured the class so that everything could be done using their phones actually, which they do have pretty advanced phones now.

615
02:03:31,928 --> 02:03:37,691
And we used to have a dark room at Medford High that we're hoping to try to resurrect.

616
02:03:37,731 --> 02:03:44,095
We need to solve some ventilation issues so that the following year we could hopefully offer film photography as well.

617
02:03:44,235 --> 02:03:46,857
So it's an exciting new development.

618
02:03:47,366 --> 02:03:47,606
Thank you.

619
02:03:47,626 --> 02:03:48,187
That's exciting.

620
02:03:48,207 --> 02:04:04,861
I know when my daughter mentioned it when she was doing her fall selections, I did not know that you can buy for like 20 bucks, really amazing equipment to attach to your iPhone and turn them into like equipment that didn't even exist when I was a kid.

621
02:04:06,102 --> 02:04:07,724
So it's kind of amazing how

622
02:04:08,462 --> 02:04:12,324
the bar is much lower to be able to do some great stuff.

623
02:04:12,344 --> 02:04:13,424
So that's exciting.

624
02:04:13,584 --> 02:04:13,844
Thank you.

625
02:04:13,864 --> 02:04:18,547
And Mr. Kane started a photography club this year to sort of help generate interest.

626
02:04:18,627 --> 02:04:23,849
And he applied for a Medford Educational Fund grant and received a nice photo printer.

627
02:04:24,289 --> 02:04:27,170
So we'll be able to start showcasing the work right away.

628
02:04:27,531 --> 02:04:27,951
Excellent.

629
02:04:27,991 --> 02:04:28,391
Thank you.

630
02:04:28,471 --> 02:04:28,831
Thank you.

631
02:04:34,234 --> 02:04:36,395
Thank you for the wonderful presentation and all the hard work.

632
02:04:36,515 --> 02:04:37,195
We appreciate it.

633
02:04:41,576 --> 02:04:47,783
Next, we have an update on the before and after school program, Miss Megan Fiddler-Carrie, Director of Family and Community Engagement.

634
02:04:48,223 --> 02:04:48,524
Welcome.

635
02:04:48,944 --> 02:04:50,005
Hello, welcome.

636
02:04:50,746 --> 02:04:51,186
Good evening.

637
02:04:51,226 --> 02:04:52,167
It's nice to see you all.

638
02:04:53,189 --> 02:04:59,996
Thank you for this opportunity for my biannual update about before and after school, where I kind of give you

639
02:05:00,965 --> 02:05:11,549
A purpose for today will be just a snapshot on the state of the program for both before and after school, where we are, how many students we have, what the makeup of the students are that are currently attending.

640
02:05:11,569 --> 02:05:28,736
And then I have some proposals I'd like to run by you so that we can continue our discussions about keeping affordability for after school families, but also the retention rate for the before and after school staff who we know

641
02:05:29,543 --> 02:05:34,889
You've heard me several times say that it's kind of a tricky time period of the day to hire for.

642
02:05:35,069 --> 02:05:45,540
So I want to make it an attractive job for quality people, qualified applicants.

643
02:05:46,280 --> 02:05:48,583
So I'll just get into the current state of the program.

644
02:05:48,983 --> 02:05:51,786
I want to include some background in case there's anybody watching.

645
02:05:52,179 --> 02:05:56,101
who's new to the Medford public schools and hasn't heard me talk about that before and after school.

646
02:05:56,501 --> 02:05:58,903
I know that a lot of people are registering for kindergarten now.

647
02:05:59,663 --> 02:06:03,785
We'll talk about the applying for the lottery for people for next year.

648
02:06:04,246 --> 02:06:06,047
We'll talk about that a little bit later in the presentation.

649
02:06:06,147 --> 02:06:15,572
So before and after school programs are at all four of the elementary schools in Medford, before school for one hour and after school from dismissal until six o'clock.

650
02:06:16,412 --> 02:06:21,135
And it will be the same on the early release Wednesdays next year from dismissal until six o'clock.

651
02:06:23,604 --> 02:06:27,127
We have, it's broken down into four sections.

652
02:06:27,527 --> 02:06:41,257
We have snack, homework time, physical runaround education, physical time where the students can have an unstructured time to play, and then a structured block where we have our staff do organized activity that's either

653
02:06:41,941 --> 02:06:48,766
It can be a physical game if that's what the kids are interested in and the teachers are interested in, or it can be an activity or a craft.

654
02:06:49,507 --> 02:07:01,756
And we try and keep our ratios, our staff-student ratios, one staff for every 10 students, and that's recommended as best practice from surrounding areas and also from the Department of Early Education and Care.

655
02:07:02,057 --> 02:07:06,941
That's their recommended ratio for licensed programs, so we really try to stick to that.

656
02:07:10,455 --> 02:07:21,224
We want to provide families with affordable care so we we've got a competitive rate for tuition in place and when I say competitive, I'm always looking at surrounding towns.

657
02:07:21,844 --> 02:07:24,427
Many of you have heard me say a bazillion times that I'm on.

658
02:07:25,307 --> 02:07:27,309
It's called the network of extended day directors.

659
02:07:27,796 --> 02:07:33,760
It's a council of different after school directors from all over Massachusetts who have district run programs like ours.

660
02:07:34,200 --> 02:07:38,382
We get together every other month and we email each other constantly with questions.

661
02:07:38,943 --> 02:07:44,206
And we compare notes all the time about pay rates, tuition rates, best practices.

662
02:07:44,646 --> 02:07:49,049
So our rates are competitive compared to our surrounding towns.

663
02:07:49,625 --> 02:07:51,507
and also compared to Ned's data.

664
02:07:52,728 --> 02:07:59,994
We also have a sliding scale of financial assistance for families who demonstrate need and who qualify.

665
02:08:02,075 --> 02:08:05,959
So I've got some real details in here for you.

666
02:08:06,479 --> 02:08:08,561
This is our current state of the before and after school.

667
02:08:08,621 --> 02:08:12,044
Our current rate for before school programming is $140 a month if you attend for five days.

668
02:08:16,172 --> 02:08:18,653
and $104 a month if you attend for only three days.

669
02:08:18,753 --> 02:08:21,774
And that has stayed constant for more than five years.

670
02:08:22,214 --> 02:08:27,276
So I just want to point out that that rate has not moved in the last five years for before school.

671
02:08:27,756 --> 02:08:31,377
Our current daily rate for the afterschool program is about $26 a day.

672
02:08:31,857 --> 02:08:38,559
So families who have five days a week in afterschool pays $475 a month.

673
02:08:40,119 --> 02:08:41,480
I know I'm throwing a lot of numbers out.

674
02:08:42,318 --> 02:08:44,160
Let me know if I'm confusing it a little bit.

675
02:08:44,500 --> 02:08:49,526
But this, I know that this slide presentation is available on websites.

676
02:08:49,586 --> 02:08:53,550
So if anybody watching wants to go back and look at it, those will be available.

677
02:08:56,193 --> 02:09:01,359
In comparison, like I said, comparison to our other districts, we're neither the cheapest or the most expensive.

678
02:09:01,399 --> 02:09:02,440
We're about right in the middle.

679
02:09:07,368 --> 02:09:25,483
The makeup of our after-school program is we are overseen by Suzanne Galluzzi, the Assistant Superintendent of Academics and Instruction, myself, the Director of Family and Community Engagement, and my office is at the high school, but I spend a lot of time visiting the other schools to check in, to evaluate, and also to pitch in.

680
02:09:25,623 --> 02:09:31,448
You know, whenever we have staff out, I have the opportunity to pitch in and help out, which is actually really fun.

681
02:09:32,816 --> 02:09:39,178
And then at each of the elementary schools at the sites, we have a site coordinator who is sort of the principal of that program.

682
02:09:39,618 --> 02:09:47,741
And then group leaders, in some cases, senior group leaders for our bigger programs where we need senior group leaders who can mentor the other staff and the new staff.

683
02:09:48,522 --> 02:09:54,764
Group leaders who are like the teachers and they're the ones that plan that fourth block that I described, the activity, the structured activity.

684
02:09:55,407 --> 02:09:57,488
assistant group leaders, and high school aides.

685
02:09:57,769 --> 02:09:59,410
And our high school aides are invaluable.

686
02:09:59,750 --> 02:10:02,792
We love them, but we can't leave students alone with them.

687
02:10:02,852 --> 02:10:06,195
So they do not contribute to that 10 to one ratio that I mentioned earlier.

688
02:10:06,415 --> 02:10:07,816
I think that's really important to point out.

689
02:10:09,437 --> 02:10:11,638
They're very helpful with homework help.

690
02:10:12,339 --> 02:10:18,363
We give them a lot of training on how not to give the answers, but they are a lot closer to the math curriculum age-wise than a lot of our staff.

691
02:10:18,383 --> 02:10:20,565
So it's really imperative that we have those high school helpers.

692
02:10:21,626 --> 02:10:24,948
And the coordinators, and it's really important to note that all of

693
02:10:25,421 --> 02:10:32,665
These staff are budgeted, the pay for their salaries comes out of the tuitions that are paid for the before and after school program.

694
02:10:33,006 --> 02:10:37,869
So I wanna make clear that money coming in helps with money going out.

695
02:10:39,870 --> 02:10:40,970
Here are our current numbers.

696
02:10:41,090 --> 02:10:42,992
I know that this is, oh, can we go back one?

697
02:10:45,513 --> 02:10:46,774
Oh, no, the current, no, you're right.

698
02:10:47,094 --> 02:10:48,095
Sorry, these are current numbers.

699
02:10:48,175 --> 02:10:51,257
I thought that I had the after school first, but I put the before school numbers first.

700
02:10:51,917 --> 02:10:55,019
So we have 40 students at the Brooks, 20 at the McGlynn,

701
02:10:56,098 --> 02:10:58,599
17 at the Missittuck, and 26 at the Roberts.

702
02:10:59,120 --> 02:11:01,661
We've been fortunate that we haven't had gigantic wait lists.

703
02:11:02,121 --> 02:11:14,346
We do at the Roberts because it's a staffing, it's also a capacity, it's about the needs of our students that are in our program and how much supervision they need.

704
02:11:14,606 --> 02:11:23,390
So when we think about taking students off of our wait lists, we have to think about the students that we have in front of us and which staff members we have to meet those needs.

705
02:11:24,598 --> 02:11:26,859
So staffing is challenging at the before school.

706
02:11:27,019 --> 02:11:28,880
It's all staffed by teachers and paras.

707
02:11:29,020 --> 02:11:33,922
We don't have outside people that only come and work in the before school program and then leave.

708
02:11:35,683 --> 02:11:36,603
It's before school paras.

709
02:11:36,704 --> 02:11:45,687
And I will note also, this will come up later, the pay for before school teachers also hasn't changed in several years.

710
02:11:46,408 --> 02:11:48,169
And I wanna talk to you a little bit about that.

711
02:11:49,049 --> 02:11:49,889
Okay, next slide, please.

712
02:11:50,450 --> 02:11:52,791
So this is the numbers for the after school program.

713
02:11:54,206 --> 02:11:59,251
You'll look at these numbers, but I do wanna, I would like all of you to recall that we had a discussion.

714
02:11:59,331 --> 02:12:01,953
I'm not sure if it was the last time I was here or when I was here in the fall.

715
02:12:03,194 --> 02:12:08,179
We've talked about, instead of talking about how many students are in a program, we talk about how many seats are in a program.

716
02:12:08,259 --> 02:12:19,189
So when we're talking about wait lists, it's really important to talk about seats, the number of seats, and that's how many kids are there on a given day, how many kids we have capacity to support on a given day.

717
02:12:19,591 --> 02:12:24,233
versus these numbers that you're looking at right now, which is how many students are on our roster.

718
02:12:24,653 --> 02:12:26,774
So not all of these students come every day.

719
02:12:27,294 --> 02:12:31,196
Students can come to the afterschool program two, three, or five days a week.

720
02:12:32,997 --> 02:12:36,058
And so these numbers don't represent a given day.

721
02:12:36,098 --> 02:12:41,500
They represent the total number of students that I have contact information for and emergency information for.

722
02:12:42,821 --> 02:12:44,822
So I'll give you a second to look at those numbers.

723
02:12:47,298 --> 02:12:51,699
you'll notice that the wait lists are significant, especially at the Brooks and the Roberts.

724
02:12:52,640 --> 02:12:55,981
And we do our best to look at them very closely.

725
02:12:56,001 --> 02:13:00,702
If there's any movement, we reach out to the people on the wait list, the next on the list.

726
02:13:00,782 --> 02:13:08,744
And if somebody who was only there for two days leaves, I call, and even if the person has told me they need five days, I call and say, well, would these two days be helpful to you?

727
02:13:09,505 --> 02:13:13,106
And if they say, no, we really only need five, I go down to the next person on the list.

728
02:13:13,266 --> 02:13:14,106
That's how it's been working.

729
02:13:17,763 --> 02:13:21,505
So this is the demographic information that has been requested for me in the past.

730
02:13:22,185 --> 02:13:24,566
So this is the whole before and after school program.

731
02:13:24,946 --> 02:13:31,649
We met about this as a team and I was starting to look at it and breaking it down by before school and after school and the different, the four schools.

732
02:13:31,689 --> 02:13:37,431
And we realized that we might be getting a little close to violating some FERPA confidentiality for students.

733
02:13:37,751 --> 02:13:41,772
So that's why you have it in aggregate for the whole before and after school programs.

734
02:13:44,233 --> 02:13:46,114
But we wanted to just show that information.

735
02:13:50,362 --> 02:13:56,788
Okay, now I know many, if some people have tuned in just for the before and after school program, they're probably interested in this information.

736
02:13:58,089 --> 02:14:08,878
For new students coming to Medford next year who are not current students in the Medford Public School Program, there is a lottery for the open spots that will start on April 1st.

737
02:14:09,899 --> 02:14:17,905
Application and sign up for that lottery will be open from April 1st until April 13th, and then the lottery will run on April 14th.

738
02:14:19,275 --> 02:14:23,936
There's going to be a Google form that I'll put up on April 1st on our website.

739
02:14:23,996 --> 02:14:25,537
It'll be on our main page.

740
02:14:25,817 --> 02:14:27,857
It'll be on the before and after school website.

741
02:14:28,398 --> 02:14:34,359
I'll have links to it on the Facebook page, which if you're interested in after school, I encourage everyone to follow us at after Medford.

742
02:14:34,840 --> 02:14:37,660
There's a, there's a final slide at the end with that information as well.

743
02:14:38,201 --> 02:14:46,663
But this, I don't want to put it up any earlier than that because I don't want to confuse people to think that if they've engaged with that form at all, that they've already signed up.

744
02:14:47,185 --> 02:14:54,170
So I'm waiting until April 1st to even put the Google form on the website, but that will be available on April 1st.

745
02:14:54,771 --> 02:14:55,591
And Ms.

746
02:14:56,292 --> 02:14:58,854
Fidlikary, is the lottery new?

747
02:14:59,694 --> 02:15:02,156
No, this will be the third year that we've run the lottery.

748
02:15:02,256 --> 02:15:06,699
Third year that you've run the lottery, but there's still a wait list proponent to it.

749
02:15:07,020 --> 02:15:09,541
So this is a great question.

750
02:15:09,561 --> 02:15:12,864
I'm glad you brought this up because this is very worth clarification.

751
02:15:13,144 --> 02:15:14,385
So wait lists,

752
02:15:16,153 --> 02:15:19,037
It's not one spot for one spot in our afterschool program.

753
02:15:19,457 --> 02:15:28,928
We have grade groups, because for example, if a spot opens up in fifth grade, but there's a kindergartner on the wait list, we can't put the kindergartner in the fifth grade grade group.

754
02:15:29,727 --> 02:15:49,504
So it's really important to note that our wait lists, so the open spots we'll have available are mostly at the kindergarten level, because as everybody's graduated up, the fifth graders have gone on to middle school, but the fourth graders are now fifth graders, and the people on that wait list are still on that wait list.

755
02:15:49,624 --> 02:15:56,349
They can't have a kindergarten spot because it wouldn't work to put fourth graders in the kindergarten grade group.

756
02:15:56,950 --> 02:15:58,111
Thank you for asking that question.

757
02:16:02,929 --> 02:16:08,915
So while we're talking about waitlists, and like I said, it's only for new students.

758
02:16:08,975 --> 02:16:11,577
The lottery is only for new students who are not currently enrolled.

759
02:16:12,038 --> 02:16:22,027
Anyone who's currently on a waitlist does not have to enter the lottery on April 1st, because their waitlist currently, where they are on the waitlist will transfer till next year.

760
02:16:22,507 --> 02:16:26,191
They move year to year and they stay right where they are and just move up.

761
02:16:27,216 --> 02:16:38,987
So I'm gonna take this opportunity to take a break in the presentation to ask, to offer a proposal, something that we've talked about in many different circles about possibly changing that format for the wait list.

762
02:16:39,027 --> 02:16:39,968
I wanna run this by you.

763
02:16:40,848 --> 02:16:45,492
Instead of a ranked list where students, I'll run it by the lottery.

764
02:16:45,753 --> 02:16:46,714
It'll give me a list.

765
02:16:47,194 --> 02:16:52,319
The top people on that list get the open spots and everybody else is put on the wait list in that order.

766
02:16:53,624 --> 02:16:58,908
anybody added to the wait list, instead of calling it a list, it'll be like they stay in the lottery.

767
02:16:59,529 --> 02:17:02,251
So they'll be put in their grade group.

768
02:17:03,692 --> 02:17:11,558
But as soon as a spot opens up, I'll run that lottery for the students who are in the wait list through the lottery generator.

769
02:17:11,578 --> 02:17:13,599
I mean, the generator again.

770
02:17:13,859 --> 02:17:16,661
So it's as though they have a fresh chance every time.

771
02:17:19,773 --> 02:17:20,934
I'm sure this will have questions.

772
02:17:21,294 --> 02:17:26,897
So we can either take a break and take questions now, or I could save, I can go through the rest of the presentation.

773
02:17:26,917 --> 02:17:28,317
We'll do questions about that at the end.

774
02:17:28,958 --> 02:17:29,958
Yeah, that's, that sounds good.

775
02:17:30,358 --> 02:17:30,578
Okay.

776
02:17:32,379 --> 02:17:34,300
So let that jumble and come up with your questions.

777
02:17:35,961 --> 02:17:40,724
I want to let that digest in my head because people at the bottom of the list would love that plan.

778
02:17:40,784 --> 02:17:44,365
People that have been waiting for years that are at the top of the list would hate that plan.

779
02:17:44,465 --> 02:17:44,646
Right.

780
02:17:44,726 --> 02:17:45,306
Member Rousseau.

781
02:17:46,621 --> 02:17:51,242
So the change, though, is not for anybody currently on a wait list.

782
02:17:51,302 --> 02:17:53,203
It would just be the new kindergartners.

783
02:17:53,463 --> 02:17:54,243
We could talk about that.

784
02:17:54,283 --> 02:17:54,903
We could decide.

785
02:17:54,983 --> 02:17:55,163
OK.

786
02:17:55,383 --> 02:17:55,603
Yeah.

787
02:17:55,623 --> 02:17:57,904
I mean, if that could be the recommendation.

788
02:17:58,164 --> 02:18:15,268
So my understanding of some of the problem with a wait list, everybody gets a number when we do the lottery, is that if you're number one on the wait list, well, that

789
02:18:17,031 --> 02:18:20,313
means something different than if you're number 142 on the wait list.

790
02:18:22,514 --> 02:18:24,195
At least it does to the parent.

791
02:18:25,456 --> 02:18:37,724
In reality, I mean, if I was a parent and I was number one on the wait list, I would make decisions very differently than if I was number 107, I'm sorry, 107 at the Brooks wait list.

792
02:18:38,264 --> 02:18:39,905
I would not behave the same.

793
02:18:40,805 --> 02:18:43,426
I would be like, somebody's gonna leave.

794
02:18:43,486 --> 02:18:45,547
Somebody's gonna, something's gonna happen.

795
02:18:45,647 --> 02:18:46,648
I'm gonna get a spot.

796
02:18:46,808 --> 02:18:51,950
I'm not going to find additional, I'm not gonna be looking for another option.

797
02:18:53,911 --> 02:18:58,473
And if I'm number one, it doesn't feel terribly risky.

798
02:18:58,493 --> 02:19:00,573
If I'm number three, it's sort of as a risk.

799
02:19:00,954 --> 02:19:03,435
And as you move down the list, it becomes pointless.

800
02:19:03,815 --> 02:19:04,295
If you're number 107,

801
02:19:06,977 --> 02:19:11,801
to say it's risky to just wait for a spot is an understatement.

802
02:19:13,363 --> 02:19:17,386
The problem is being number one on the wait list does not mean you're next.

803
02:19:18,767 --> 02:19:24,472
And I think that that is an impossible logical thing for most families to comprehend.

804
02:19:25,053 --> 02:19:28,536
Being number one on the wait list does not mean you get the next spot.

805
02:19:29,397 --> 02:19:34,021
So if a kindergartner is doing two days a week,

806
02:19:36,039 --> 02:19:46,566
And they move and now it opens up and the next person needs five days a week or three days a week or two days a week, but a different two days a week.

807
02:19:47,066 --> 02:19:48,567
Those two days cannot work.

808
02:19:49,968 --> 02:19:51,048
They're number one on the list.

809
02:19:51,408 --> 02:19:52,309
They don't get a spot.

810
02:19:53,490 --> 02:20:02,635
And I think this is too complicated, frankly, for even when we've had this conversation before and I have to like, am I saying it correctly?

811
02:20:02,695 --> 02:20:03,896
Because it is complicated.

812
02:20:04,597 --> 02:20:15,525
And I think it's unfair for people who are number one, two, three, four, five to be put in a position of- False hope.

813
02:20:15,585 --> 02:20:16,305
What do you do?

814
02:20:16,546 --> 02:20:17,806
False hope.

815
02:20:17,866 --> 02:20:28,994
It's like, do you have to communicate with you at least 72 times over the summer in hopes that number one will, you'll go from number one to having a seat.

816
02:20:31,116 --> 02:20:34,158
It feels like it sets a situation up where

817
02:20:35,100 --> 02:20:41,341
you look, not you personally, but the program looks bad and it gives false hope.

818
02:20:42,422 --> 02:20:48,383
And so that's sort of my big problem with this list.

819
02:20:49,723 --> 02:21:02,666
I also think that we've talked about who's in the list, meaning are there people who aren't even applying because they know we have

820
02:21:03,857 --> 02:21:05,218
not anywhere near enough spots.

821
02:21:05,478 --> 02:21:10,743
And my mind, we wanna know how big is the actual demand.

822
02:21:10,843 --> 02:21:13,085
And we do not know the actual demand right now.

823
02:21:14,406 --> 02:21:21,893
I mean, at the Brooks, if you take all of the kids that are in the program and everybody that's on the wait list, that's like half the student body.

824
02:21:22,754 --> 02:21:25,516
But the other schools, it's not anywhere near that.

825
02:21:26,297 --> 02:21:29,560
And without knowing the demand,

826
02:21:30,416 --> 02:21:31,797
it's really hard to make decisions.

827
02:21:31,817 --> 02:21:44,141
I think if everybody was, we picked the top, the kids that are getting a spot and everybody else gets to sit in the pile, well, then there's this like, it could be my turn.

828
02:21:44,781 --> 02:21:58,586
And it would feel like I would wanna throw my name in the hat and maybe get a much cheaper program than I'm gonna get at a private provider, which is really a different conversation we'll have later in the slide deck.

829
02:22:00,692 --> 02:22:05,776
I just think that, and correct me if I'm wrong, but other districts do not do wait lists.

830
02:22:05,896 --> 02:22:08,679
They do a lottery every time a spot opens up.

831
02:22:09,980 --> 02:22:10,440
That's correct.

832
02:22:10,520 --> 02:22:12,742
There are several districts that don't do wait lists at all.

833
02:22:13,723 --> 02:22:20,428
There are some that have finite wait lists that they'll take a wait list of five students and then they turn off the wait list.

834
02:22:23,210 --> 02:22:24,611
So that's a possibility.

835
02:22:26,261 --> 02:22:30,082
a waitlist as long as I've been asked to, because I'm like you, I'm curious.

836
02:22:30,122 --> 02:22:32,002
I want to know what the actual demand is.

837
02:22:32,062 --> 02:22:34,483
I'd like to know the true data about it.

838
02:22:35,183 --> 02:22:38,684
But to your point, there are several families that I've never heard from.

839
02:22:38,764 --> 02:22:42,785
So I don't know that they don't need it just because they're not on my waitlist.

840
02:22:43,485 --> 02:22:52,727
And I don't know that some of the people on my waitlist actually do need it, or they're just thinking, you know, I'd rather my child hang out with friends at school instead of come home.

841
02:22:54,133 --> 02:23:01,336
to just me, so they don't necessarily need childcare, but they want socialization and all the other benefits that afterschool programs have.

842
02:23:01,836 --> 02:23:08,539
So it's not completely accurate data, but I keep the long wait lists for that reason.

843
02:23:09,279 --> 02:23:19,163
So if we did away with the wait list, the lottery situation right now is we run it, we create the wait list,

844
02:23:20,413 --> 02:23:27,237
And then I moved to Medford or I hear about this system after the date of the wait list gets generated now.

845
02:23:27,878 --> 02:23:33,101
And I would know to not apply because there's 107 kids on the wait list.

846
02:23:33,301 --> 02:23:34,502
I will be number 108.

847
02:23:35,202 --> 02:23:38,865
I'm not filling out a damn form so I can be number 108 on the wait list.

848
02:23:38,925 --> 02:23:40,926
That's not how I like to use my time.

849
02:23:42,187 --> 02:23:48,611
But if we get rid of the wait list, I find out about this after the selection has happened.

850
02:23:49,342 --> 02:23:51,705
I move to Medford after the selection has happened.

851
02:23:52,006 --> 02:24:05,922
I fill out the form in June, July, August, September, any time I get added into the pile, and I have the same opportunity as anybody else to get picked the next time a spot opens.

852
02:24:06,022 --> 02:24:08,986
And that feels particularly fair to me because

853
02:24:11,414 --> 02:24:20,722
Well, I mean, communications isn't our biggest strength, but even if it was our biggest strength, there will always be people moving into the community or people who are just completely unaware.

854
02:24:20,742 --> 02:24:26,827
And it doesn't feel like, well, frankly, always knowing what's going on is a very privileged position.

855
02:24:27,647 --> 02:24:37,676
And so for people that do not have that privilege to also lose the opportunities that we offer just seems like a double whammy.

856
02:24:39,870 --> 02:25:01,257
I'll wait for my motion because I realize that other people have something to say, but it feels a lot fairer to me, both to a parent that would know to not get this false hope, but also to all the people who don't know in time about this two-week period to have the same opportunities to use the services that we're providing.

857
02:25:01,617 --> 02:25:04,638
And everybody should have those same opportunities, so thank you.

858
02:25:06,159 --> 02:25:06,419
Thank you.

859
02:25:06,519 --> 02:25:06,979
Member Graham?

860
02:25:08,140 --> 02:25:08,460
Thank you.

861
02:25:10,528 --> 02:25:24,473
I like where this proposal is going for a bunch of reasons, not the least of which is we, we get a lot of feedback about communication with the afterschool program, right?

862
02:25:24,513 --> 02:25:26,754
We get lots of requests for data.

863
02:25:26,774 --> 02:25:29,355
We get, we have lots of really interested parents.

864
02:25:30,195 --> 02:25:37,238
And one of the things I hear from parents when they're frustrated is with the best of intention, you're trying to set expectations.

865
02:25:37,697 --> 02:25:39,817
and it's received really, really badly.

866
02:25:40,258 --> 02:25:43,818
And so suddenly you are the actual problem, right?

867
02:25:43,878 --> 02:25:49,300
Because you have said you're 107 on the wait list, like you should make other arrangements, right?

868
02:25:49,340 --> 02:26:00,042
And I think that's true, accurate and factual, but it's putting you in a position to constantly be peppered with questions about, am I getting closer?

869
02:26:00,122 --> 02:26:00,922
Am I getting closer?

870
02:26:00,982 --> 02:26:01,902
Am I getting closer?

871
02:26:02,562 --> 02:26:04,703
And I think that's,

872
02:26:06,846 --> 02:26:11,308
intended to be a satisfying thing for people to know that progress is being made.

873
02:26:11,828 --> 02:26:14,869
But I don't think it actually bears out that way at all.

874
02:26:15,250 --> 02:26:18,531
I think it just constantly creates this frustration.

875
02:26:18,631 --> 02:26:29,015
So I'm hugely in favor of not pulling a wait list for all the reasons that Member Rousseau talked about and that we've talked about over a long period of time.

876
02:26:29,035 --> 02:26:31,836
I would like us to think about

877
02:26:33,686 --> 02:26:38,549
Today, if we're going to take a vote, being the line of marcation, right?

878
02:26:38,629 --> 02:26:44,532
So if you are on the wait list today, you can stay on the list, right?

879
02:26:44,652 --> 02:26:46,753
We'll process you in and through.

880
02:26:47,354 --> 02:26:50,535
But I don't want to create a window.

881
02:26:51,906 --> 02:26:55,568
for people to rush to sign up because then they get on the list.

882
02:26:56,328 --> 02:27:04,852
And then the lottery like becomes this really hollow thing because so many people rush to get on the list that like the lottery can never actually happen.

883
02:27:04,872 --> 02:27:11,035
And obviously with the kindergartners, like that's like the fresh start through to start setting that precedent.

884
02:27:11,095 --> 02:27:20,139
But I think even for families who may have a first grader or a second grader, like I don't want to create a situation where

885
02:27:20,933 --> 02:27:29,955
we're sort of inflating the number of people on the list because people perceive that that's the way to combat the fact that we're going to move to a lottery-based system.

886
02:27:32,275 --> 02:27:49,678
So I think it probably makes sense to think through that as well and to provide some sort of line of demarcation that comes from us so that you don't have to be the arbiter of that decision or be in a position where you have to

887
02:27:50,182 --> 02:27:58,889
be the like voice of disappointment again and again and again as we make this transition because these transitions are hard for people and I totally like understand and appreciate that.

888
02:28:00,851 --> 02:28:03,253
So I think this has a lot of merit.

889
02:28:03,613 --> 02:28:12,441
And I think when we talk about wanting to serve as many people as possible, I think that's it's great.

890
02:28:12,481 --> 02:28:15,263
And it's something we should continue to work toward.

891
02:28:15,863 --> 02:28:16,424
But I think

892
02:28:17,468 --> 02:28:23,693
the process while we're not there has become a bit untenable for the district.

893
02:28:24,233 --> 02:28:34,961
And my concern is that if it continues to get more and more and more untenable, that we will do what lots of districts do and just say, we can't do this anymore.

894
02:28:35,121 --> 02:28:40,345
And we can't afford for that to happen in Medford because Medford doesn't have other options.

895
02:28:41,026 --> 02:28:43,848
Lots of these other communities have lots of options and we do not.

896
02:28:43,968 --> 02:28:45,529
So we can't create

897
02:28:46,047 --> 02:28:49,069
an environment that continues to like set up this discontent.

898
02:28:49,809 --> 02:29:02,357
Um, so I think people maybe be unhappy about this shift, but I would rather like sort of withstand that in the short term, then create a situation where a year from now you all are coming to us and saying, we can't do this anymore.

899
02:29:02,437 --> 02:29:03,798
Like we can't make this work.

900
02:29:04,379 --> 02:29:04,879
It is too much.

901
02:29:05,179 --> 02:29:07,100
That is what I really want to try to avoid.

902
02:29:07,120 --> 02:29:11,443
And so I do feel like we have to take some active measure to, to get us there.

903
02:29:11,523 --> 02:29:12,904
So I'm totally in favor of it.

904
02:29:13,410 --> 02:29:24,316
I just would want to make sure that we're super clear about what it is, who gets to stay on the wait list, and who is subject to lottery when that happens.

905
02:29:27,078 --> 02:29:32,000
Yeah, if somebody looks back a couple of slides, they'll notice that that was one of the things that I said.

906
02:29:32,060 --> 02:29:37,443
Other districts have opted to not have a district-run program for reasons like this.

907
02:29:37,803 --> 02:29:40,305
It's a real concern, especially in Medford.

908
02:29:42,887 --> 02:29:46,969
Lots of communities face the same issue in their school-based programs.

909
02:29:47,789 --> 02:29:52,352
Lots of other communities have lots of other options, and that is not something that we have here in Medford.

910
02:29:52,412 --> 02:29:53,012
We just don't.

911
02:29:53,432 --> 02:30:03,317
Although I did want to share the good news about, um, there is one new program coming to Medford and as promised, we're doing everything in our capacity to partner with them.

912
02:30:03,577 --> 02:30:05,698
Um, so it's a program called Ready, Set, Kids.

913
02:30:06,038 --> 02:30:09,400
And I believe some parents actually were instrumental in helping to sort of

914
02:30:10,494 --> 02:30:14,597
them to the city and they'll be opening up in West Medford with a small program.

915
02:30:14,697 --> 02:30:19,460
But it's something and it's an alternative to help us with the waitlist, number one.

916
02:30:19,560 --> 02:30:24,564
And number two, as we've said before, an in-district at-school program is not perfect for every kid.

917
02:30:24,984 --> 02:30:33,370
There are a lot of kids who need a change of scenery for whom staying in the same building for possibly 10 hours if they're in the before and after school program.

918
02:30:33,823 --> 02:30:34,824
is really not ideal.

919
02:30:34,924 --> 02:30:38,085
So I'm delighted that there's another alternative opening up.

920
02:30:38,466 --> 02:30:39,326
I'd love to see more.

921
02:30:39,566 --> 02:30:42,748
And again, I will, the superintendent is committed to this.

922
02:30:42,788 --> 02:30:57,756
We'll do anything that we can in partnership with them to help ease the transition, whether that's providing transportation from the elementary schools to those programs, or I invited her to join on the Medford Family Resource Council with the Medford Family Network so that we can all kind of work together and share resources.

923
02:30:57,836 --> 02:30:59,617
So we're still committed to that.

924
02:30:59,737 --> 02:31:01,698
So as far as, thank you.

925
02:31:03,188 --> 02:31:05,871
Any other questions on the lottery until we get to it?

926
02:31:05,891 --> 02:31:08,635
Do you want to wait for my motion to the end?

927
02:31:10,597 --> 02:31:12,059
Do you want to make my motion now?

928
02:31:14,982 --> 02:31:15,643
Let us process.

929
02:31:15,663 --> 02:31:17,205
We'll do all motions at the end if you can.

930
02:31:17,385 --> 02:31:17,586
Thanks.

931
02:31:21,499 --> 02:31:29,884
Okay, so now I've given you sort of the state of the program and who the students are and where we are with the students, but now I'd like to talk to you about the budget of the program.

932
02:31:30,284 --> 02:31:36,088
As a reminder, and to people who are watching who don't know about this, the district-run program is fully self-supported.

933
02:31:36,208 --> 02:31:45,253
It's a revolving account for people who know that parlance, but it's the outgoing money for costs is supported by the incoming money from tuition.

934
02:31:45,754 --> 02:31:49,016
So with that in mind, I have some presentations on the budgets.

935
02:31:49,316 --> 02:31:52,158
So this is my projection for next year.

936
02:31:53,799 --> 02:32:03,064
Total personnel costs, and that's counting those at the school personnel that I mentioned, the site coordinators, group leaders, assistant group leaders, and high school aides.

937
02:32:04,878 --> 02:32:22,098
And then supplies and this is for our crafts and our games and we share with the schools, a little bit, but we try not to because we understand that those are sort of belong to the phys ed teacher belong to the art teacher so we like to have our own supplies and that way if we wreck something we're not feeling guilty about it the next day so.

938
02:32:22,591 --> 02:32:24,852
supplies, miscellaneous expenses.

939
02:32:24,952 --> 02:32:31,556
Of course, at every school, we have cell phones for emergencies and for dismissals and administrative personnel.

940
02:32:31,576 --> 02:32:36,959
So this is for me, my salary comes out of this revolving account and my administrative assistant.

941
02:32:37,259 --> 02:32:45,403
And then you'll recall school committee members that as part of the budget, I believe last year, we talked about including the wraparound paraprofessionals.

942
02:32:46,644 --> 02:32:58,910
and wrap around, this was suggested by you, this has been suggested by our superintendent, I think we're finally gonna make it happen with the paraprofessionals union, that we're gonna have a paraprofessional position that is from 11 to five.

943
02:32:59,410 --> 02:33:06,313
So they support the school for the second half of the school day, but then stay to support the afterschool programs for the afternoon.

944
02:33:07,216 --> 02:33:22,116
And I think this is instrumental because these are people who are in the building and know the school, they know the students, they can come to the after school program having, you know, been a part of the tenor of the day, they can say there was some incident that might make some kids agitated and they bring this information to the after school.

945
02:33:22,745 --> 02:33:25,307
and they work those lucrative hours.

946
02:33:25,808 --> 02:33:32,333
So there's money allotted that has never been allotted from the afterschool budget before for those paraprofessionals.

947
02:33:32,473 --> 02:33:33,735
That's the new cost.

948
02:33:34,135 --> 02:33:38,318
Another new cost is the Office of Family and Community Engagement Program Manager.

949
02:33:38,378 --> 02:33:44,884
So this is a woman who she works partly to support the before and afterschool programs and partly for the Medford Family Network.

950
02:33:45,344 --> 02:33:47,706
And she's really helping in the Medford Family Network

951
02:33:48,956 --> 02:33:50,597
with grants and grant reporting.

952
02:33:51,158 --> 02:33:58,023
And she's gonna be doing some funding searching for lots of different programs in the family engagement offices.

953
02:33:58,223 --> 02:34:03,447
So she'll be looking for more funding for Medford Family Network as well as professional development and funding for the afterschool programs.

954
02:34:04,047 --> 02:34:05,509
So some of her salary comes from there too.

955
02:34:05,829 --> 02:34:06,049
Mayor.

956
02:34:08,231 --> 02:34:08,751
Member Russell.

957
02:34:11,053 --> 02:34:14,455
Just to point out that when we look at a budget like this,

958
02:34:16,087 --> 02:34:22,111
there's a gigantic line item that does not exist that would exist in any private program.

959
02:34:23,852 --> 02:34:31,236
And that is we, the program pays exactly $0 for the building, $0 for heat, $0 for electricity.

960
02:34:32,397 --> 02:34:38,840
These are incredibly expensive that the district provides and are free to the program.

961
02:34:38,881 --> 02:34:42,923
And that's fine, but I think it's important to consider when we talk about how

962
02:34:44,191 --> 02:34:48,855
On the next slide, you'll see that there's more income than going out.

963
02:34:50,156 --> 02:35:06,928
But it is, in my mind, not a reflection of just like a cash cow, like to have these programs in a facility where you are paying rent and you are paying your own utilities would far outstrip the deferential.

964
02:35:07,909 --> 02:35:11,872
So I just think that's really important when looking at this budget to recognize that,

965
02:35:13,493 --> 02:35:19,334
that the excess cash is not just, it's not play money.

966
02:35:19,574 --> 02:35:24,275
It's like, we're providing something as a district, the taxpayers are.

967
02:35:24,935 --> 02:35:31,756
And so it is, in my mind, very appropriate and rational that that is essentially coming back.

968
02:35:33,217 --> 02:35:35,697
I'll let you get to your next slide where you'll see that, but thank you.

969
02:35:35,737 --> 02:35:39,538
No, that's a great point, because in addition to utilities and custodial,

970
02:35:40,987 --> 02:35:45,950
services, we have payroll services, we have lots of, you're right, lots of work that is done.

971
02:35:45,970 --> 02:35:47,411
That's a great idea.

972
02:35:47,431 --> 02:35:51,794
I should include a kind of in-kind line in there next time I do this, I will.

973
02:35:52,694 --> 02:36:01,760
Because that is, it's appreciated and it's extensive, especially because I have so many people coming in and out of the before or the after school

974
02:36:02,546 --> 02:36:03,667
service throughout the year.

975
02:36:03,767 --> 02:36:13,437
So I'm constantly in the human resources office like, Hey, I have another new person, you know, for two days a week, but you still have to do the same amount of work that you would do for a salaried person who works every day.

976
02:36:13,517 --> 02:36:15,760
So that is, that's definitely worth noting.

977
02:36:15,780 --> 02:36:17,982
Okay.

978
02:36:19,263 --> 02:36:24,969
So this is our anticipated income, especially depending on, you know,

979
02:36:25,848 --> 02:36:27,352
conversations we have a couple slides later.

980
02:36:27,813 --> 02:36:34,408
But so we are fortunate to have for the last several years received a grant from the city from the community to

981
02:36:34,707 --> 02:36:36,327
community development block grant.

982
02:36:37,768 --> 02:36:43,228
They have different grants that meet the needs of residents who qualify for as low income residents.

983
02:36:43,369 --> 02:36:46,509
And so we've qualified for tuition subsidies for our students.

984
02:36:47,069 --> 02:36:50,350
Last year, their funding, the city's funding was cut.

985
02:36:50,510 --> 02:36:56,111
So all of their grantees funding was cut a little bit, but typically we've enjoyed $10,000 a year.

986
02:36:56,671 --> 02:37:02,112
So we see no reason, fingers crossed, that we won't get that full 10,000.

987
02:37:02,352 --> 02:37:03,512
Hopefully it'll be back up.

988
02:37:04,060 --> 02:37:08,841
for next year to subsidize and, but otherwise we'll have the income from the tuitions.

989
02:37:12,342 --> 02:37:18,864
It's important to note that we, we have to keep this, this is a revolving account and all of our expenses come from the tuitions.

990
02:37:18,984 --> 02:37:24,325
So we need to keep this healthy and keep on top of it and make sure that we're, you know, always in the black.

991
02:37:26,570 --> 02:37:33,895
So the proposal that I have for, I did after school first, because this is one that we ask for every year.

992
02:37:34,315 --> 02:37:37,797
Historically, we've asked for only two to 3% increases.

993
02:37:38,238 --> 02:37:44,321
And that was in line with what the state increased for what they would reimburse us for vouchers.

994
02:37:44,702 --> 02:37:51,586
So you'll recall last year was the, we stopped taking vouchers from the state because for several reasons.

995
02:37:52,046 --> 02:37:55,989
And this year we are doing financial assistance on our own sliding scale.

996
02:37:57,532 --> 02:38:08,399
But because it's our own sliding scale and we're not reliant on reimbursement from the state, we don't necessarily have to follow what their reimbursement minimums or maximums rather are.

997
02:38:09,439 --> 02:38:14,482
So this year, I'm proposing going up just a little bit more than 3%, the 3%.

998
02:38:14,602 --> 02:38:15,863
And it's to get us closer to

999
02:38:20,199 --> 02:38:26,901
closer to the middle top of where other districts are to help us cover our costs that we're anticipating for next year.

1000
02:38:27,462 --> 02:38:31,383
And the biggest cost that I'll talk about in a minute is pay rates to the staff.

1001
02:38:32,363 --> 02:38:35,525
And I'd like you to consider that.

1002
02:38:36,145 --> 02:38:38,706
So look at, you'll have those numbers for the afterschool tuition.

1003
02:38:38,866 --> 02:38:44,508
And then again, before school tuition, as I've said, has not changed in several years.

1004
02:38:44,648 --> 02:38:47,809
Certainly not since I've been working as the before and after school,

1005
02:38:50,452 --> 02:38:51,253
which has been five years.

1006
02:38:51,393 --> 02:38:56,836
So I propose raising that to an even $10 an hour.

1007
02:38:56,856 --> 02:38:59,998
I think it's the next one.

1008
02:39:00,959 --> 02:39:01,139
Yeah.

1009
02:39:04,121 --> 02:39:09,285
Okay, are there, before I go on to pay rates, are there any questions that jump out?

1010
02:39:09,325 --> 02:39:09,905
Yeah, keep going.

1011
02:39:10,085 --> 02:39:10,526
Okay, sorry.

1012
02:39:10,926 --> 02:39:16,169
Okay, so pay rates, again, I outlined all the different positions that we have in the afterschool program.

1013
02:39:18,194 --> 02:39:26,420
So I've struggled with retention of staff for years since I've worked in afterschool, which was five years here and before that in a different district.

1014
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:34,826
And it's a tricky time of day to hire for, but also we have to compensate well.

1015
02:39:34,906 --> 02:39:38,188
We have to understand that they are planning for these students.

1016
02:39:38,228 --> 02:39:38,969
They're keeping them safe.

1017
02:39:39,009 --> 02:39:39,629
They are the nurse.

1018
02:39:39,690 --> 02:39:40,710
There's no nurse on staff.

1019
02:39:40,750 --> 02:39:41,431
They're the parents.

1020
02:39:41,511 --> 02:39:44,453
They're the communication with the parents.

1021
02:39:44,493 --> 02:39:47,275
They're often delivering messages from the school when parents pick up.

1022
02:39:47,677 --> 02:39:51,280
So it's really imperative that we right size their paychecks.

1023
02:39:51,520 --> 02:39:52,742
And I feel like they've been.

1024
02:39:54,214 --> 02:39:56,876
Underpaid, I think we did a big service to them two years ago.

1025
02:39:56,936 --> 02:40:02,000
We gave them a significant pay rate that was fantastic, and we were ahead in Massachusetts.

1026
02:40:02,980 --> 02:40:04,261
But then everybody did what we did.

1027
02:40:04,361 --> 02:40:05,762
Everybody said, wow, look at Medford.

1028
02:40:06,123 --> 02:40:07,404
They've got something going.

1029
02:40:08,024 --> 02:40:09,365
And so everybody has risen to us.

1030
02:40:09,405 --> 02:40:11,967
So we're no longer in the lead for our pay rates.

1031
02:40:12,448 --> 02:40:13,428
We are right in the middle.

1032
02:40:14,169 --> 02:40:23,436
And I'd just like to propose right-sizing our pay for site coordinators and group leaders, which is where we were sort of dipping.

1033
02:40:27,228 --> 02:40:33,371
I just also want to point out that I don't think the takeaway should be that we raised our rates so everybody else did too.

1034
02:40:33,431 --> 02:40:45,237
There's an entire economic set of factors at play that make jobs like this a completely different animal today than they were two years ago or three years ago.

1035
02:40:47,178 --> 02:40:51,120
And so if we want to compete in the economic reality, like we

1036
02:40:52,762 --> 02:41:00,849
I think we did the right thing two years ago and what you're proposing here is the right thing in the right now because wages don't go down.

1037
02:41:00,869 --> 02:41:03,011
That just really doesn't happen.

1038
02:41:03,171 --> 02:41:10,498
So if we don't do this, I think we're going to be able to service even fewer kids next year because we will have fewer staff.

1039
02:41:10,718 --> 02:41:14,862
So we need to make sure that we're prioritizing serving as many kids as we possibly can.

1040
02:41:16,063 --> 02:41:17,064
And if I may, from the chair,

1041
02:41:17,958 --> 02:41:24,800
Your slide for budgeted estimates for 2023-2024, does that take into account us approving?

1042
02:41:25,140 --> 02:41:27,240
Yes, I was being very optimistic.

1043
02:41:28,461 --> 02:41:30,981
I wondered if maybe that slide should have been in different order.

1044
02:41:32,142 --> 02:41:35,622
So the revenue would be, okay, the 1.5.

1045
02:41:36,142 --> 02:41:44,965
If we approve the increases in the rates and the estimates for the budget, that's as if we approved the pay increases.

1046
02:41:45,425 --> 02:41:46,005
Okay, thank you.

1047
02:41:49,491 --> 02:41:50,892
So, thank you.

1048
02:41:51,352 --> 02:41:57,874
I know I might be a little bit out of step on this from other people, and that's why there's a committee and not just one person in charge.

1049
02:41:58,875 --> 02:42:08,178
But, you know, what's, you know, we live in a end stage capitalist society.

1050
02:42:08,198 --> 02:42:13,480
I think that's really not a, that's not a controversial statement.

1051
02:42:15,161 --> 02:42:15,801
And the

1052
02:42:16,863 --> 02:42:32,051
private companies, nationwide private companies providing these services are paying dramatically more than we will ever pay and charging families, you know, $40,000 a year.

1053
02:42:34,172 --> 02:42:46,438
So, you know, this program is in a weird space where it is not public, not private, but also somehow competing with

1054
02:42:47,432 --> 02:42:47,852
private.

1055
02:42:49,033 --> 02:42:58,816
So I don't, you know, I look at these wages and I see none of these wages making somebody leave another job to take these jobs.

1056
02:42:59,297 --> 02:43:05,239
I just can't fathom anyone leaving any job at any pay to take these jobs.

1057
02:43:05,859 --> 02:43:15,803
So if our goal is competition for workers, which, you know, it's like been front page news for three years now that everybody left the workforce.

1058
02:43:16,636 --> 02:43:20,559
not everybody, but a lot of people, and they're not coming back.

1059
02:43:21,420 --> 02:43:26,243
So, you know, in my mind, we have to get workers that already have jobs elsewhere.

1060
02:43:27,124 --> 02:43:28,745
That's how you get your workers.

1061
02:43:28,785 --> 02:43:30,466
That's how every private business does it.

1062
02:43:32,488 --> 02:43:35,530
And, you know, just wishing that they're gonna show up.

1063
02:43:36,371 --> 02:43:44,156
I don't know how that, I'm not saying you're doing it, but just wishing that they're gonna appear to me seems,

1064
02:43:47,532 --> 02:43:48,652
fantastical, really.

1065
02:43:49,813 --> 02:43:56,754
And I know that, you know, I've talked before with you one on one, like, you know, we go to $100 an hour, do we get a bunch of workers?

1066
02:43:56,814 --> 02:43:57,114
Yes.

1067
02:43:57,194 --> 02:44:00,995
And then two years later, every other district has $100 an hour jobs.

1068
02:44:01,456 --> 02:44:03,556
And it's the same size workforce.

1069
02:44:04,596 --> 02:44:09,158
But at some point, we do start peeling people off other types of employment.

1070
02:44:10,678 --> 02:44:10,778
And

1071
02:44:11,420 --> 02:44:21,205
And in my mind, until we start peeling people away from other employment types, we're just sort of running in a circle here.

1072
02:44:22,386 --> 02:44:25,728
At best, we're going to keep up, and it's not going to fall further behind.

1073
02:44:25,888 --> 02:44:31,010
But I don't really envision us somehow producing more employees.

1074
02:44:31,591 --> 02:44:33,232
That just is not an option.

1075
02:44:33,632 --> 02:44:39,035
So I look at these wages, and I say, OK, these are not 40 hour

1076
02:44:40,160 --> 02:44:41,260
a week jobs.

1077
02:44:42,221 --> 02:45:09,731
So unless you are independently wealthy or living at home and don't wanna work a full-time job, or, I mean, I'm incredibly grateful for every single person that does work for us in this program, but there is, I mean, without knowing any of them, well, I know a couple of them, I'm assuming none of them are paying for rent or a mortgage in Medford on these wages.

1078
02:45:10,862 --> 02:45:15,864
they're probably not even able to eat on top of all the other stuff.

1079
02:45:16,164 --> 02:45:25,128
So I just think that as a public body trying to provide a public service, reality has to come into the room a little bit here.

1080
02:45:26,849 --> 02:45:33,392
And while some of these, I mean, $36 an hour, I mean, that's not nothing.

1081
02:45:34,353 --> 02:45:37,574
Well, it's important to point out too that those guys only work 26 hours a week.

1082
02:45:38,254 --> 02:45:39,255
So it's not, to your point,

1083
02:45:40,046 --> 02:45:40,907
point that should be clear.

1084
02:45:41,027 --> 02:45:43,809
It's not a 48 for, you know, for 40 hours of work.

1085
02:45:44,089 --> 02:45:44,289
Right.

1086
02:45:44,650 --> 02:45:49,433
So, um, I mean, I look at those increases and I'm just like, why not more?

1087
02:45:50,374 --> 02:46:06,527
Um, and you know, when we talk about the sliding scale, you know, I'm not sure I've talked about this with you or not, but you know, when we did the superintendent search, we asked for incomes of people filling out the survey and I will never forget the results.

1088
02:46:07,387 --> 02:46:08,268
And I understand that

1089
02:46:08,621 --> 02:46:21,665
it's not a generalization of the city of Medford and what the incomes are, but by far the number one income level of the people that filled out the superintendent search were households with more than $250,000 in income.

1090
02:46:21,845 --> 02:46:23,086
And this was five years ago.

1091
02:46:25,146 --> 02:46:37,050
So I just really have an incredible problem with people who are residents, the people we serve, if they have incomes like that,

1092
02:46:37,773 --> 02:46:41,516
paying these rates to me feels absolutely wrong.

1093
02:46:43,078 --> 02:46:43,858
Absolutely wrong.

1094
02:46:44,579 --> 02:46:52,406
And if they lived in places that don't have this, they'd be paying $40,000 a year for the same services, or they'd be getting a nanny.

1095
02:46:52,766 --> 02:46:57,531
And I don't know what a nanny costs, but not what we're charging.

1096
02:46:58,071 --> 02:47:04,017
So I'm all for dramatically increasing these rates and then providing a steeper

1097
02:47:05,103 --> 02:47:08,504
sliding scale so that we are not making anybody who can't afford it.

1098
02:47:09,245 --> 02:47:17,068
Look, if your household income is 50,000 or 70,000, like you can't afford the high end of these rates probably.

1099
02:47:17,528 --> 02:47:19,369
And I mean, I don't know what the scale looks like.

1100
02:47:19,689 --> 02:47:24,291
So in my mind, we take the curve and we turn it up.

1101
02:47:26,172 --> 02:47:34,795
And if some people whose household incomes are 400,000, $800,000 a year, and there are plenty of people in Medford where that's their household income,

1102
02:47:35,322 --> 02:47:43,686
that are actually applying to be in these programs, let's not pretend that's not the case, they may go and say, I'll just get a nanny.

1103
02:47:44,587 --> 02:47:56,433
And if we diminish demand, then the people that are on the present day waitlist future lottery pool have a greater chance of actually getting a spot.

1104
02:47:56,960 --> 02:48:01,182
And those people are less likely and able to afford expensive options.

1105
02:48:01,882 --> 02:48:13,166
So, I mean, I'm not looking to like, say, put an income cap, because if you're paying at the high end of the scale, you're supporting people at the bottom end of the scale.

1106
02:48:13,326 --> 02:48:14,367
And I think that's wonderful.

1107
02:48:14,407 --> 02:48:15,567
I think that's great.

1108
02:48:16,867 --> 02:48:22,229
But I don't see this increase of 3% when inflation is through the roof.

1109
02:48:22,690 --> 02:48:25,911
We're never going to buy a building in Medford to make a childcare center

1110
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:28,601
less than many millions of dollars.

1111
02:48:30,841 --> 02:48:33,982
I don't know I just don't know why we are going a little bigger with this.

1112
02:48:35,183 --> 02:48:37,644
That's that's my opinion on that.

1113
02:48:40,285 --> 02:48:43,206
Thank you miss look area think you have one more slide.

1114
02:48:45,386 --> 02:48:46,247
But member Graham.

1115
02:48:52,409 --> 02:48:52,969
I'll remember it.

1116
02:48:54,482 --> 02:48:54,902
No problem.

1117
02:48:54,942 --> 02:48:55,502
That happens.

1118
02:48:55,582 --> 02:48:56,223
It's getting late.

1119
02:48:57,103 --> 02:48:58,723
Sorry.

1120
02:48:59,003 --> 02:48:59,704
One slide left.

1121
02:49:00,584 --> 02:49:07,166
And that's just to talk about, as I said, the before school pay rate, which again, has not been increased in at least the last five years.

1122
02:49:07,746 --> 02:49:11,427
So it's again, just right sizing the pay rates.

1123
02:49:11,487 --> 02:49:12,868
We have two positions.

1124
02:49:12,928 --> 02:49:13,968
We call them in the before school.

1125
02:49:14,008 --> 02:49:14,828
There's the lead teacher.

1126
02:49:14,868 --> 02:49:19,910
They're the ones that are in charge of reaching out to all the families to tell them, you know, how the process works.

1127
02:49:19,950 --> 02:49:22,971
They're in charge of getting payroll to me and then their support staff.

1128
02:49:23,031 --> 02:49:23,151
So.

1129
02:49:23,712 --> 02:49:25,574
These are the two different pay rates to increase them.

1130
02:49:26,334 --> 02:49:27,315
Before I leave, I'd be remiss.

1131
02:49:27,355 --> 02:49:32,139
I want to just give a shout out to thank all the site coordinators at the after-school programs, because they're amazing.

1132
02:49:32,399 --> 02:49:38,804
Marissa Davis at the Brooks, Kathy Hunt at the McGlynn, Kathleen Keenan at the Roberts, and Jacqueline Salamone at the Mississauga are fantastic.

1133
02:49:39,465 --> 02:49:40,906
And I want to publicly thank them.

1134
02:49:41,727 --> 02:49:42,667
But thank you very much.

1135
02:49:42,727 --> 02:49:43,948
That's all I've got.

1136
02:49:44,109 --> 02:49:46,911
And now I'm ready for questions.

1137
02:49:47,091 --> 02:49:47,331
Thank you.

1138
02:49:47,371 --> 02:49:48,912
I think we have a few motions and questions.

1139
02:49:48,972 --> 02:49:49,453
Member Graham?

1140
02:49:50,827 --> 02:50:00,295
The new rates that you're proposing would not include any change to the sliding scale rate that we created last year.

1141
02:50:00,315 --> 02:50:00,735
Correct.

1142
02:50:00,815 --> 02:50:06,760
The sliding scale I used based on what the Community Development Grant Office uses to determine their low income.

1143
02:50:07,180 --> 02:50:08,101
So I've used the same one.

1144
02:50:08,201 --> 02:50:09,842
I meant the tuition rate.

1145
02:50:10,123 --> 02:50:19,610
So what we created, so last year, right, we said if you qualify, you keep the rate from the prior year, and now everybody else sort of ticked up.

1146
02:50:20,222 --> 02:50:25,624
and everyone else is gonna tick up again, is that rate flat or are you saying that's also going to tick up?

1147
02:50:26,904 --> 02:50:38,068
Well, I had thought that would tick up in the way that I was looking at it was everybody's percentage off or percent discount would be determined based on the full rate.

1148
02:50:40,549 --> 02:50:46,271
So I'd be willing to entertain either option, the full rate and you can get either 20, 50 or 80% off.

1149
02:50:52,762 --> 02:50:54,323
I'm now I'm getting the percentages wrong.

1150
02:50:55,084 --> 02:51:00,648
So in other words, the way the program works is based on your income threshold, you get a percentage off.

1151
02:51:00,929 --> 02:51:01,149
Yes.

1152
02:51:01,449 --> 02:51:01,969
Correct.

1153
02:51:02,170 --> 02:51:02,390
Right.

1154
02:51:02,470 --> 02:51:17,902
So if we do what member Rousseau is suggesting, and we make that rate much higher than those percent, that does make the program less affordable for those folks that are at that, at that, um, at those tiered levels, right?

1155
02:51:17,942 --> 02:51:18,603
The sliding scale.

1156
02:51:19,901 --> 02:51:29,267
It makes, I mean, if they're paying 20% now, it'll be 20%, right, of a bigger number and it'll still go up for them, yes.

1157
02:51:30,288 --> 02:51:38,493
So I wondered, maybe I'll just try to like spit out a motion and you guys can tell me if you love it or hate it.

1158
02:51:39,113 --> 02:51:49,320
Can I make a motion that you will investigate what the financials could look like to keep

1159
02:51:49,864 --> 02:52:07,131
the sliding scale cost flat while providing an increase to the market rate that is bigger than what you've outlined here and bring that back to us.

1160
02:52:08,631 --> 02:52:09,692
Does that make any sense at all?

1161
02:52:12,074 --> 02:52:12,914
might need it repeated.

1162
02:52:12,954 --> 02:52:22,036
How would it affect your bottom line if you kept this the sliding scale the same as the last two years for the low for the low income?

1163
02:52:22,376 --> 02:52:37,039
So yeah in other words how could you keep the sliding scale like actual cost yep the same and what would a corresponding increase to the market rate need to be

1164
02:52:37,617 --> 02:52:41,959
increase over and above what you have here in order for all of your financials to still work, right?

1165
02:52:42,059 --> 02:52:47,422
Because your program has to be liquid in totality.

1166
02:52:47,482 --> 02:52:53,404
So we can't like say yes to one thing and no to another thing without understanding, does it all work together?

1167
02:52:53,544 --> 02:52:58,907
So I think my request is a slightly different cut at this that

1168
02:52:59,775 --> 02:53:06,016
preserves the actual dollar cost for the sliding scale.

1169
02:53:06,456 --> 02:53:09,757
And that might just mean changes to how the sliding scale works.

1170
02:53:10,017 --> 02:53:10,417
I don't know.

1171
02:53:11,577 --> 02:53:20,339
But what would it take to offset and keep the program liquid all in, assuming the staff rates and all of that?

1172
02:53:20,359 --> 02:53:29,641
I don't want us to make one-off decisions, because you can't operate the program if we make a series of one-off decisions that don't actually work together.

1173
02:53:30,763 --> 02:53:31,804
Okay, ma'am.

1174
02:53:32,645 --> 02:53:33,425
Member McLaughlin.

1175
02:53:34,146 --> 02:53:34,526
Thank you.

1176
02:53:34,766 --> 02:54:00,287
So if I understand what member Graham is proposing is trying to be inclusive of economically disadvantaged families to keep them at a rate that would be reasonable for them to be able to access the program while also considering an increase in the rate for folks who are not

1177
02:54:01,420 --> 02:54:10,523
economically disadvantaged to make it more market value so that we can therefore afford more of the things that we're talking about.

1178
02:54:10,903 --> 02:54:13,524
But you just want to come back with that at this point.

1179
02:54:14,164 --> 02:54:15,244
Okay, so I'll second that.

1180
02:54:15,704 --> 02:54:16,425
Okay, thank you.

1181
02:54:17,865 --> 02:54:23,087
Okay, motion on the floor by Member Graham, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

1182
02:54:23,107 --> 02:54:25,528
Would you like me to read it again?

1183
02:54:25,968 --> 02:54:26,148
No.

1184
02:54:26,628 --> 02:54:26,888
Okay.

1185
02:54:27,202 --> 02:54:36,307
I think we all understand, and that's gonna, we're not gonna be able to vote specifically on any of the substance tonight, but we can put it on our next agenda once we get these answers.

1186
02:54:36,387 --> 02:54:37,868
So, got it.

1187
02:54:39,989 --> 02:54:40,689
All those in favor?

1188
02:54:41,290 --> 02:54:41,370
Aye.

1189
02:54:41,550 --> 02:54:41,670
Aye.

1190
02:54:42,010 --> 02:54:42,790
All those opposed?

1191
02:54:43,211 --> 02:54:43,951
Motion passes.

1192
02:54:44,051 --> 02:54:45,452
Thank you for the presentation.

1193
02:54:45,472 --> 02:54:46,312
Mayor, I have a motion.

1194
02:54:47,453 --> 02:54:48,253
Member Rousseau?

1195
02:54:48,854 --> 02:54:56,518
I'd like to make a motion that beginning with the 2023-2024 school year going forward, incoming kindergartners

1196
02:54:58,514 --> 02:55:04,616
that we will change the wait list to an on-demand lottery, and that the lottery will remain open.

1197
02:55:06,756 --> 02:55:07,116
Second.

1198
02:55:11,798 --> 02:55:12,578
Member McLaughlin.

1199
02:55:15,799 --> 02:55:16,619
Can you say that again?

1200
02:55:16,659 --> 02:55:17,679
I'm tired, I think.

1201
02:55:17,779 --> 02:55:18,280
Sure.

1202
02:55:18,380 --> 02:55:19,100
I'll summarize it.

1203
02:55:19,200 --> 02:55:20,880
Yeah, in a little different language.

1204
02:55:20,900 --> 02:55:21,040
Yes.

1205
02:55:21,280 --> 02:55:21,901
Thank you.

1206
02:55:22,081 --> 02:55:27,082
So the incoming kindergartners that are going to be in the lottery in April,

1207
02:55:28,413 --> 02:55:42,039
that the lottery will happen, and that everybody who does not get picked will be left in the lottery, and that anybody who finds out about it later can just simply fill out the same application form.

1208
02:55:42,059 --> 02:55:44,180
So there's really not an end date to the application.

1209
02:55:44,200 --> 02:55:45,641
So there's no wait list.

1210
02:55:45,961 --> 02:55:46,801
There's no wait list.

1211
02:55:46,821 --> 02:55:47,601
That's correct.

1212
02:55:47,681 --> 02:55:50,603
If there's an opening spot midway through the year, it would be a lottery.

1213
02:55:50,623 --> 02:55:51,283
Correct.

1214
02:55:53,654 --> 02:55:55,195
Motion is already seconded.

1215
02:55:55,235 --> 02:55:57,856
Motion on the floor by Member Russo, seconded by Member Graham.

1216
02:55:58,356 --> 02:55:59,116
All those in favor?

1217
02:55:59,457 --> 02:55:59,557
Aye.

1218
02:55:59,897 --> 02:55:59,977
Aye.

1219
02:56:00,077 --> 02:56:00,757
All those opposed?

1220
02:56:00,897 --> 02:56:01,617
Motion passes.

1221
02:56:02,218 --> 02:56:02,478
Mayor?

1222
02:56:02,758 --> 02:56:03,198
Member Graham.

1223
02:56:04,158 --> 02:56:09,040
Can I just invite you to join us on Zoom next week if you would prefer that?

1224
02:56:09,561 --> 02:56:16,443
We would love to have you here because there's plenty of chairs, but we get it.

1225
02:56:16,763 --> 02:56:21,946
If you want to join us on Zoom, I think that's totally fine, and I just want you to do what you need to do.

1226
02:56:22,166 --> 02:56:22,826
We can hear you.

1227
02:56:23,387 --> 02:56:26,469
whether you're on the camera or not, as long as my colleagues are in agreement.

1228
02:56:26,689 --> 02:56:28,109
And I think that'll be in two weeks.

1229
02:56:28,149 --> 02:56:32,091
You have two weeks to get the data formulated.

1230
02:56:32,111 --> 02:56:32,852
That'll be April 3rd.

1231
02:56:32,872 --> 02:56:33,992
All right.

1232
02:56:34,253 --> 02:56:34,853
Member Rousseau?

1233
02:56:35,493 --> 02:56:40,896
I have a question about the before school pay, where we're paying teachers.

1234
02:56:42,657 --> 02:56:43,957
Is that in the contract?

1235
02:56:44,158 --> 02:56:50,781
And if not, how are we kind of getting around the fact that we pay them outside of the contract to work for the district?

1236
02:56:52,606 --> 02:56:55,687
Did I just make a terrible faux pas and say that out loud?

1237
02:56:56,668 --> 02:56:56,988
Sorry.

1238
02:56:57,008 --> 02:56:59,849
We'll take that under advisement and look into it.

1239
02:57:00,069 --> 02:57:00,289
Yes.

1240
02:57:01,210 --> 02:57:04,131
I mean, I think I would probably have to maybe look back.

1241
02:57:04,511 --> 02:57:11,114
I think when before school started with just each individual school running their own before school program.

1242
02:57:11,134 --> 02:57:12,034
So if Ms.

1243
02:57:12,054 --> 02:57:18,217
Fidler-Carrie is saying that the price has not increased since she assumed this position,

1244
02:57:20,117 --> 02:57:21,757
I think that's something that we can look into.

1245
02:57:21,897 --> 02:57:32,160
We just have a newly agreed upon contract through the teacher's union, typically things that are outside, you know, contractual time.

1246
02:57:32,320 --> 02:57:33,540
That's the difference here.

1247
02:57:34,520 --> 02:57:40,242
Things that are during contractual time, there's like a pay associated with that, but that's something that we can look into.

1248
02:57:40,722 --> 02:57:41,082
Thank you.

1249
02:57:41,322 --> 02:57:41,622
Thank you.

1250
02:57:41,702 --> 02:57:41,882
Yeah.

1251
02:57:42,762 --> 02:57:43,062
Thank you.

1252
02:57:43,082 --> 02:57:43,582
Thank you, Ms.

1253
02:57:43,622 --> 02:57:44,583
Fidelicari.

1254
02:57:44,623 --> 02:57:46,223
We'll see you on the third one way or another.

1255
02:57:46,485 --> 02:57:47,045
All right.

1256
02:57:47,065 --> 02:57:50,188
Thank you so much for your time and consideration and support.

1257
02:57:51,368 --> 02:57:51,809
Absolutely.

1258
02:57:51,869 --> 02:57:52,689
Thank you for your hard work.

1259
02:57:54,591 --> 02:57:57,873
No, we do not have any presentations of the public or continued business.

1260
02:57:57,973 --> 02:58:03,717
We do have number nine reports requested follow up presentation on Medford high school action plan.

1261
02:58:03,817 --> 02:58:05,879
Dr. Edward Vincent, superintendent.

1262
02:58:09,591 --> 02:58:24,736
Yes, so the following report is in response to some specific questions that were asked about some of the changes that have taken place at the high school.

1263
02:58:25,716 --> 02:58:36,460
And so there were a lot of questions regarding how long are students waiting to use the restrooms, you know, regarding the,

1264
02:58:39,224 --> 02:58:41,446
the new structures that are in place at the high school.

1265
02:58:42,287 --> 02:58:47,631
And so at lunchtime, we have the cafeteria bathrooms open on all floors.

1266
02:58:49,413 --> 02:59:00,622
And sometimes during that time, due to the volume of students that are eating, a line of three to four students can be there waiting anywhere from two to three minutes.

1267
02:59:02,243 --> 02:59:05,146
But usually the lines are moving fairly quickly.

1268
02:59:06,701 --> 02:59:22,752
As for other periods throughout the day when we don't have a large number of students eating at the same time, I'm not really noticing lines and neither are the administrative teams aware of that.

1269
02:59:24,214 --> 02:59:36,515
At the end of the day, sometimes during period six, there are some students that do request to use the bathrooms at that point in time, but we've been working with them.

1270
02:59:38,166 --> 02:59:38,526
on that.

1271
02:59:39,767 --> 02:59:43,769
The next question that was asked was, how do we know that it's working?

1272
02:59:44,290 --> 02:59:50,933
The two-person maximum for the time being right now, we really feel that it's truly ingrained.

1273
02:59:51,134 --> 02:59:53,295
The students know what the expectation is.

1274
02:59:54,075 --> 03:00:00,359
And so they go in, it's two students at a time outside of all of the larger bathrooms.

1275
03:00:01,420 --> 03:00:10,245
We now have hooks that the students come, they hang their placards and they go into the restroom.

1276
03:00:10,305 --> 03:00:14,788
So at any given time, you can see there are two placards outside.

1277
03:00:14,808 --> 03:00:19,211
And when they come out, they take it and they do that.

1278
03:00:19,291 --> 03:00:22,093
We've added the hooks because it helps to keep track.

1279
03:00:22,993 --> 03:00:31,741
but also we just felt that it was more sanitary to keep the placards outside of the restroom as opposed to inside the restrooms.

1280
03:00:33,583 --> 03:00:39,849
So the next question was, is there evidence that fewer students are outside of the classroom?

1281
03:00:39,989 --> 03:00:43,513
And so the administrators pulled the data

1282
03:00:44,793 --> 03:00:56,359
going back to the beginning of the year, and you can see the noted reduction in cuts that were taking place.

1283
03:00:56,800 --> 03:01:07,985
And so not only do, when you're physically walking the halls, it's completely different experience, but there is hard data to support

1284
03:01:10,266 --> 03:01:11,027
what we're seeing.

1285
03:01:11,547 --> 03:01:14,528
And so we're very, very encouraged by that.

1286
03:01:17,729 --> 03:01:32,034
Moving along, there was a question regarding about the availability in our last meeting and how do we solve this problem in a permanent and sustainable way?

1287
03:01:32,094 --> 03:01:35,896
So we currently have seven building monitors at the high school.

1288
03:01:36,736 --> 03:01:59,866
And so between the cameras being monitored and supervision and support throughout the high school and a designated monitor, at least at the front door, as students and guests or guests come into the building, we do feel that we have a good amount of coverage at the high school.

1289
03:02:02,116 --> 03:02:09,180
in addition to the teachers that signed up to take on some of these additional duties.

1290
03:02:11,281 --> 03:02:22,246
We've encountered a few glitches when we've had coverage where maybe someone was absent and that could be one of the building monitors or if someone was feeling ill, not well.

1291
03:02:22,746 --> 03:02:27,669
So in those cases, we've had to shuffle around

1292
03:02:28,409 --> 03:02:36,732
And if we're short coverage, then the additional administrators will step up and support with additional coverage.

1293
03:02:37,452 --> 03:02:52,157
But again, we do feel at this point in time with the seven monitors that are currently working at the high school, that we feel that it is a manageable number and sustainable.

1294
03:02:53,908 --> 03:02:58,651
So question two, again, was about do we see fewer students roaming the hallways?

1295
03:02:59,172 --> 03:03:14,122
And again, if you refer to the same table that was in question one, yes, it is definitely very obvious and there is a difference.

1296
03:03:16,043 --> 03:03:25,186
And a culture shift is taking place at the high school and we are paying close attention to that.

1297
03:03:26,126 --> 03:03:34,708
So the next question was about the sustainability and the distribution of the school IDs.

1298
03:03:35,308 --> 03:03:44,031
And that which I shared in my last update is an area where we are looking at other options and one of the

1299
03:03:45,131 --> 03:03:57,239
possible suggestions was is there an opportunity to provide electronic IDs or some kind of ID, given that smartphones are everywhere, which we thought was a, you know, excellent suggestion.

1300
03:03:57,259 --> 03:04:04,304
And so we are, you know, willing to look at other options and that could be because again,

1301
03:04:05,525 --> 03:04:17,214
Almost every student has a telephone, so it would just be a question of them potentially being able to show their identification through an electronic ID of some sort.

1302
03:04:17,555 --> 03:04:21,458
So we are trying to explore and look into that as an option.

1303
03:04:23,496 --> 03:04:27,517
Question three was, has there been an increase in the report of bullying?

1304
03:04:28,397 --> 03:04:35,859
And so for the 21-22 school year, there were seven reports of bullying.

1305
03:04:36,739 --> 03:04:43,981
And as of March 15 of 2022, there were two confirmed bullying situations.

1306
03:04:44,941 --> 03:04:47,345
During the school year.

1307
03:04:48,807 --> 03:04:55,577
We have had 10 reports of bullying, bullying, two of them have been confirmed at the high school.

1308
03:04:56,117 --> 03:04:59,362
And so, some of you may wonder why is there a discrepancy.

1309
03:05:01,063 --> 03:05:03,024
With the reports that go forward.

1310
03:05:04,465 --> 03:05:07,266
There could be a variety of solutions.

1311
03:05:08,226 --> 03:05:15,109
There have been restorative circles they have been meetings with students and families where bullying report was.

1312
03:05:16,330 --> 03:05:30,673
submitted but you know the parties came down, came together sat down, had conversations and families chose not to go further with the bullying investigation that happens sometimes.

1313
03:05:31,293 --> 03:05:51,770
We also have some students that a bullying report may have been started for a student and over the course of the investigation and looking into additional supports for those students, that some students may currently be placed in other settings.

1314
03:05:52,191 --> 03:05:55,994
So they received other settings that would provide additional support to them.

1315
03:05:56,694 --> 03:06:08,016
And so in those cases, sometimes the bullying report, because the student was receiving additional supports elsewhere, that that's why that number does not show.

1316
03:06:08,436 --> 03:06:21,579
Also, sometimes when the bullying investigation takes place and it runs its full course, that in the end, it may not be identified or found it to be bullying.

1317
03:06:22,299 --> 03:06:26,441
So that's also another factor.

1318
03:06:26,661 --> 03:06:39,226
But at this point in time for the high school for this year, there are two official confirmed bullying reports that are on record at this point in time.

1319
03:06:41,671 --> 03:06:52,116
The next question was, has there been an audit of appropriateness of prior decisions to ensure that prior decisions were made in compliance with our definitions and policies?

1320
03:06:52,937 --> 03:07:07,564
So the administrative team debriefs regularly, including conversations with our medical staff, our school counselors, engagement specialists, and other building administrative members to ensure

1321
03:07:08,324 --> 03:07:18,150
that appropriate disciplinary measures are being meted out based on the needs of the specific child or student.

1322
03:07:18,810 --> 03:07:23,813
So I can say that not every situation is a one size fits all.

1323
03:07:24,393 --> 03:07:27,575
There are special situations

1324
03:07:28,075 --> 03:07:30,236
that are taken into consideration.

1325
03:07:30,336 --> 03:07:47,124
And so we do collaborate consistently with other members of our team, again, including our medical staff, our counselors, our adjustment specialists, our engagement specialists, our adjustment counselors, school psychologists.

1326
03:07:48,244 --> 03:07:56,128
We bring in many different stakeholders as we look at situations that arise.

1327
03:07:58,427 --> 03:08:01,209
Has the district been responding in a timely way?

1328
03:08:01,870 --> 03:08:05,213
So the district is responding in a timely way.

1329
03:08:05,233 --> 03:08:15,842
The responding administrator follows up with the reporter within 24 to 48 hours or sooner, depending on what the situation is.

1330
03:08:15,902 --> 03:08:24,650
So there is frequent communication between teachers and administrators, and there is a response within 24 to 48 hours.

1331
03:08:26,632 --> 03:08:35,244
And again, decisions are made as soon as practicable based on the details and complexity of what is being reported.

1332
03:08:38,345 --> 03:08:45,310
Question four, when will the handbook be presented to the school committee for review and approval?

1333
03:08:45,911 --> 03:08:54,617
So the high school site council reviews and makes final recommendations at the beginning of May.

1334
03:08:55,838 --> 03:09:01,983
This handbook can be presented to the school committee anytime once the site council review is completed.

1335
03:09:02,643 --> 03:09:12,829
We anticipate bringing an updated version before the committee with revisions by late May to early June of this year.

1336
03:09:12,849 --> 03:09:22,515
And again, the date can be changed at the discretion of the committee, but since it is something that the site councils do look at, there are periodic

1337
03:09:24,417 --> 03:09:32,267
Revisions that may have been done but in light of the greater substantive changes that took place this year.

1338
03:09:33,689 --> 03:09:39,958
We want to be able to just work with the site council and then bring it to the committee by late May early June.

1339
03:09:41,780 --> 03:09:46,924
And the percentage of acknowledgement forms, they have been signed by students and families.

1340
03:09:47,485 --> 03:09:55,511
The hard copies are kept in the assistant principal offices on file.

1341
03:09:55,871 --> 03:10:00,875
So each house has approximately, you know, 400 students, give or take.

1342
03:10:01,455 --> 03:10:05,758
So we are just working on getting those tallies.

1343
03:10:06,459 --> 03:10:11,623
And I can work on getting that to the committee, what the final percentage was.

1344
03:10:13,376 --> 03:10:20,199
How will we know that this worked and what will be or look different if this action was effective?

1345
03:10:20,579 --> 03:10:29,022
So I do feel the hard referral data to the assistant principals has gone down at a significant rate.

1346
03:10:29,802 --> 03:10:35,485
This has allowed them to effectively manage and address student behaviors in a timely fashion.

1347
03:10:36,625 --> 03:10:46,351
Students are reporting during monthly listening sessions that they feel safer now at the high school with the changes that have been made since January.

1348
03:10:47,552 --> 03:10:51,994
Staff are also reporting that they visibly see less roaming in the hallways.

1349
03:10:53,195 --> 03:10:57,418
and students spending more time in their classes.

1350
03:10:58,279 --> 03:11:08,406
Students are following the protocols, using the placards when they need to use the restroom or if they need to go visit one of the other offices.

1351
03:11:09,147 --> 03:11:12,769
So that is really being fully used.

1352
03:11:13,410 --> 03:11:18,553
And the eHaul pass system is also giving us additional accurate data.

1353
03:11:19,614 --> 03:11:21,915
When a student leaves the classroom and returns.

1354
03:11:22,696 --> 03:11:28,419
So, the other piece is the change in tardy check in process.

1355
03:11:29,099 --> 03:11:33,802
It's allowed us to consistently see which students are coming to school late in real time.

1356
03:11:34,882 --> 03:11:52,074
And I think all of these changes have significantly contributed to more calm and greater consistency and clarity around expectations at the high school.

1357
03:11:52,534 --> 03:11:57,998
So I just wanted to make sure that I responded to all the questions that I had received.

1358
03:11:58,558 --> 03:11:58,898
Thank you.

1359
03:11:59,219 --> 03:12:00,399
Thank you, Dr. Edward Vincent.

1360
03:12:00,980 --> 03:12:01,280
Thank you.

1361
03:12:01,300 --> 03:12:02,101
There's one question.

1362
03:12:03,736 --> 03:12:04,056
Thank you.

1363
03:12:04,076 --> 03:12:18,924
Sometimes I ask questions that make me laugh because I'm the only man in this at this table, but I'm guessing all of you have stood in a line to use the bathroom as women while there's no line for the men's room.

1364
03:12:19,224 --> 03:12:21,825
And the women's line is not true.

1365
03:12:22,685 --> 03:12:26,687
I'm just saying like, I just was talking about this with Jenny the other day.

1366
03:12:26,707 --> 03:12:29,829
I don't even remember what we were talking about, but that

1367
03:12:30,202 --> 03:12:35,264
you know, the line, somehow society has still not figured out that women need a little more time in the bathroom.

1368
03:12:35,964 --> 03:12:52,371
And I guess I'm just, from my own students' perspective, you know, and from other students' perspectives, students used to not want to use the bathrooms because they didn't think they were clean enough or they weren't safe enough.

1369
03:12:52,955 --> 03:13:04,477
And now it's just not worth it sometimes for the amount of time it takes to use a bathroom is what I'm hearing.

1370
03:13:04,897 --> 03:13:12,978
And so students not drinking and eating isn't really conducive to the best being prepared for an education.

1371
03:13:13,058 --> 03:13:21,660
So if you're telling me that the girls can get in and out of the bathrooms just as fast as the boys,

1372
03:13:24,005 --> 03:13:29,167
You're all the professionals on what it means to be a female waiting in line for a bathroom.

1373
03:13:30,148 --> 03:13:31,108
I'm obviously not.

1374
03:13:31,288 --> 03:13:37,251
And as a man, I will say that I just don't know how you all put up with it.

1375
03:13:37,711 --> 03:13:43,114
Every single time I go to any place where there's crowds, I cannot believe you don't revolt.

1376
03:13:44,194 --> 03:13:44,795
And so-

1377
03:13:48,898 --> 03:14:02,636
I still can't believe that two people, and honestly, I don't know what the lawyers would have to say if we said the rule is different for the girls versus the boys, but I certainly can't believe that two girls at the time is enough.

1378
03:14:03,157 --> 03:14:06,358
to get all of our students through the bathrooms that are open?

1379
03:14:06,418 --> 03:14:22,023
So there were only three stalls, but not only that, I think now that there are the new rules in place and the students are hanging their placards, they're going in, they're doing their business and they're coming right back out.

1380
03:14:23,024 --> 03:14:25,845
I think before they were going in and

1381
03:14:28,317 --> 03:14:37,683
Yes, that level of socializing, if you don't have a group of people to socialize with, there are only two people, you're gonna just go in, do your business and come out.

1382
03:14:38,283 --> 03:14:44,267
So even the times that I've done bathroom duty, it's pretty quick.

1383
03:14:44,287 --> 03:14:49,430
They go in, they know they might see two or three people waiting, they go in, they come out, they go in, they come out.

1384
03:14:50,871 --> 03:14:54,113
And where you have the bathroom stacked,

1385
03:14:55,154 --> 03:15:02,381
If one area were to have a slightly longer line, they know they can just go up one floor, which some students have done.

1386
03:15:02,401 --> 03:15:02,861
Okay.

1387
03:15:03,081 --> 03:15:04,423
Or up a floor or down a floor.

1388
03:15:04,443 --> 03:15:06,344
I mean, I've seen it happen.

1389
03:15:06,485 --> 03:15:11,369
I'll just have to trust you on this, because I don't really spend much time in women's bathrooms, but thank you.

1390
03:15:11,449 --> 03:15:11,970
I appreciate it.

1391
03:15:12,490 --> 03:15:13,791
Member Hayes, then Member Graham.

1392
03:15:14,772 --> 03:15:15,653
Member Hayes, you first.

1393
03:15:17,875 --> 03:15:18,776
It's who I see first.

1394
03:15:21,752 --> 03:15:22,092
Thank you.

1395
03:15:23,613 --> 03:15:25,174
I'm just wondering two things.

1396
03:15:25,194 --> 03:15:34,400
Will the student survey that we're going to do, will that be asking some questions about their current experience with the new rules in place?

1397
03:15:34,720 --> 03:15:38,242
And do we have an updated timeline for that or when that's going to happen?

1398
03:15:39,301 --> 03:15:51,691
So the answer is yes, the survey is in the Panorama portal and the translations, Dr. Cushing, are the translations in the portal as well?

1399
03:15:51,732 --> 03:15:53,433
That was the last piece we were waiting on.

1400
03:15:53,453 --> 03:16:01,660
We're currently working on the translations as it's our own tool, just trying to work on getting those translations done.

1401
03:16:02,000 --> 03:16:06,484
So Penny Bruce has those as well.

1402
03:16:07,042 --> 03:16:12,805
It's just making sure that I'm correlating the one-to-one to make sure that they're matching.

1403
03:16:13,165 --> 03:16:15,766
So that's just a little bit of a timely process.

1404
03:16:16,807 --> 03:16:26,171
But the hope is later this week is the hope and no later than the beginning of next week.

1405
03:16:26,731 --> 03:16:26,951
Great.

1406
03:16:27,932 --> 03:16:28,752
Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

1407
03:16:29,392 --> 03:16:29,853
Member Graham.

1408
03:16:33,626 --> 03:16:34,067
Thank you.

1409
03:16:34,527 --> 03:16:35,567
Thank you for the support.

1410
03:16:35,647 --> 03:16:47,555
I know I've peppered you with a lot of questions and I just wanted to like read this out for people who don't have this in front of them and we should make it available.

1411
03:16:48,135 --> 03:16:52,938
One of the questions was like, how do we know what evidence do we have that there are fewer students out of class?

1412
03:16:53,878 --> 03:16:58,481
And the superintendent provided us a chart on this report that we have.

1413
03:16:59,441 --> 03:17:05,725
And in September, the average number of classes cut per day for the student body was 19.

1414
03:17:05,885 --> 03:17:08,107
In October, it was 31.

1415
03:17:08,367 --> 03:17:10,648
In November, it was 35.

1416
03:17:11,589 --> 03:17:13,650
In December, it was 43.

1417
03:17:14,771 --> 03:17:17,413
In January, it was 14.

1418
03:17:18,673 --> 03:17:20,374
And in February, it was 16.

1419
03:17:20,655 --> 03:17:27,419
So I just wanted to point out that this is a really great example of data telling us that it worked.

1420
03:17:28,642 --> 03:17:29,403
or it's working.

1421
03:17:29,623 --> 03:17:50,355
I think it also tells us that things weren't working between October and December, which is unfortunate because I think we had ample warning in October that we had an issue that was not responded to in the best way possible because now we're seeing that when we respond with rules and structure for our high school campus, things get better.

1422
03:17:50,435 --> 03:17:51,796
So I think that's really great news.

1423
03:17:53,517 --> 03:17:55,978
The other thing that I wanted to point out is I think

1424
03:17:56,420 --> 03:18:08,307
I think that the conversation around having seven building monitors, um, but also being limited to the number of bathrooms we can open tells me that that equation is not quite right.

1425
03:18:08,327 --> 03:18:20,773
Um, so I think, I'm not sure there's much to do about it like right now in this moment, but when we talk about the budget for next year, like I do want to know, like, how do we open the bathrooms?

1426
03:18:20,874 --> 03:18:23,415
Because we as a committee have talked about this.

1427
03:18:24,460 --> 03:18:26,661
multiple times a year every year since I've been on the committee.

1428
03:18:26,681 --> 03:18:33,223
And I would really love not to talk about whether the bathrooms are or aren't open again at some point in time.

1429
03:18:33,663 --> 03:18:39,465
But I don't say that to mean that I don't care that it's a lawless land inside the bathroom.

1430
03:18:39,645 --> 03:18:40,986
That's not the point at all.

1431
03:18:41,046 --> 03:18:48,548
But in order for there to be ample open bathrooms available for students wherever their classes are,

1432
03:18:50,316 --> 03:18:54,857
seven may not be the right magical number based on the information that's provided here.

1433
03:18:54,937 --> 03:19:13,042
So again, I just would like to see us think about that during the budget and figure out like what really is sustainable because, you know, relying on people to fill in who also have to be expected to fill in for teachers that don't come because we have no substitutes seems like it's actually not super sustainable.

1434
03:19:13,062 --> 03:19:19,744
So I just want to make sure that as we head into next year, as we begin a principal search that we're going to set up

1435
03:19:20,182 --> 03:19:25,403
whoever our new principle is for success with like systems and structures that work and are sustainable.

1436
03:19:25,463 --> 03:19:29,444
So I think that's really important for us to think about as we go forward and as we build the budget.

1437
03:19:29,684 --> 03:19:30,464
So thank you for this.

1438
03:19:30,884 --> 03:19:31,204
Thank you.

1439
03:19:31,884 --> 03:19:32,064
Ms.

1440
03:19:32,084 --> 03:19:32,464
Brantley.

1441
03:19:39,186 --> 03:19:39,526
Hello.

1442
03:19:43,627 --> 03:19:44,047
Can you hear me?

1443
03:19:44,287 --> 03:19:44,427
Ms.

1444
03:19:44,447 --> 03:19:44,747
Brantley?

1445
03:19:46,707 --> 03:19:47,007
I'm here.

1446
03:19:47,027 --> 03:19:47,487
Can you hear me?

1447
03:19:47,768 --> 03:19:49,388
I do.

1448
03:19:49,468 --> 03:19:49,928
Can you hear me?

1449
03:19:50,794 --> 03:19:51,515
You must not be able to.

1450
03:19:51,975 --> 03:19:52,836
No, we can't hear you.

1451
03:20:00,521 --> 03:20:01,062
Any other questions?

1452
03:20:01,102 --> 03:20:01,422
Hello?

1453
03:20:03,083 --> 03:20:03,243
Ms.

1454
03:20:03,263 --> 03:20:03,644
Brindley?

1455
03:20:04,504 --> 03:20:05,505
Nope.

1456
03:20:05,525 --> 03:20:06,265
All right, she can't hear me.

1457
03:20:24,394 --> 03:20:24,914
Can she hear me?

1458
03:20:26,095 --> 03:20:26,515
Yes.

1459
03:20:27,456 --> 03:20:28,217
Oh, here I am.

1460
03:20:31,439 --> 03:20:33,140
Okay, so my question, hello.

1461
03:20:33,880 --> 03:20:40,465
So my question was, I was just wondering if I can have a copy of the superintendent's report, if that's possible for the public and not just for the committee.

1462
03:20:41,505 --> 03:20:44,367
Absolutely, well, are we gonna put it on the website?

1463
03:20:45,808 --> 03:20:47,910
Oh, actually member Russo just sent it to you.

1464
03:20:48,650 --> 03:20:49,731
Oh, thank you.

1465
03:20:50,792 --> 03:20:53,333
And then my other question is for,

1466
03:20:56,292 --> 03:21:13,400
The numbers for the reports and the bullying, I'm just curious, how do we know, I guess we don't know, but I just wanted to make this, just put this out there that, you know, in a lot of cases, I don't think the bullying reporting was happening.

1467
03:21:14,781 --> 03:21:23,925
So I think the numbers look good, but was all the bullying reporting actually happening?

1468
03:21:25,193 --> 03:21:34,339
So I think that that's something just to think about that the numbers don't look bad, but was it actually accurate?

1469
03:21:35,579 --> 03:21:40,862
So I know in our situation, we did not have a bullying report until after an injury.

1470
03:21:42,183 --> 03:21:46,806
And I know in another case, a bullying report was handed to a parent and said, here, read this and fill this out.

1471
03:21:46,886 --> 03:21:50,188
But I'm not really sure who's responsible in filling that paperwork out.

1472
03:21:50,848 --> 03:21:52,209
I know the nurse did it for us.

1473
03:21:53,326 --> 03:21:57,308
But, um, in her case, it was handed to the parent and said, fill this out.

1474
03:21:57,628 --> 03:22:08,634
So I'm not sure, uh, how that bullying report is supposed to really be reported and by who, um, and if that those steps have really been taken in the past.

1475
03:22:09,154 --> 03:22:11,876
So I just wanted to, um, throw that out there.

1476
03:22:14,257 --> 03:22:15,017
Thank you, Miss Friendly.

1477
03:22:15,518 --> 03:22:15,878
Thank you.

1478
03:22:19,960 --> 03:22:29,382
I'm assuming bullying reports are all funneled through to the top, and that's how we got the data, but whether or not some, yeah, at the principal level?

1479
03:22:29,722 --> 03:22:31,423
It goes to the, yeah, of each school.

1480
03:22:33,343 --> 03:22:37,304
When it's turned in.

1481
03:22:37,324 --> 03:22:38,684
Dr. Cushing and then Member Graham.

1482
03:22:45,366 --> 03:22:47,126
For the last, at least,

1483
03:22:47,768 --> 03:23:08,454
two plus years, we have instructed any time that a school leader or any time a member of the assistant principal or principals hears the word bullying, that we immediately hand them the forms and the policy, which I know is being worked on right now.

1484
03:23:08,574 --> 03:23:09,774
Traditionally, it's the forms.

1485
03:23:10,935 --> 03:23:15,136
Generally speaking, not generally speaking, per policy and state law, anyone can fill out

1486
03:23:15,788 --> 03:23:18,649
a bullying report and submit it and can be submitted anonymously.

1487
03:23:20,209 --> 03:23:35,253
In large part, if, as Miss Brantley just said, if in large part if it's being handed to a parent or someone else to fill out, that's because they are probably the best person with the most accurate information to be able to

1488
03:23:35,714 --> 03:23:49,245
you know, perhaps give screen captures or to give text messages or to give other people that they are the one most, if they're uncomfortable and they were like, no, based on what I have, then a school leader can also do that.

1489
03:23:49,325 --> 03:24:03,356
But realizing that there may be a significant amount of firsthand, very important information that won't be captured and, you know, should be captured by the reporting party, as opposed to, um,

1490
03:24:04,456 --> 03:24:10,546
You know, someone who doesn't have necessarily firsthand knowledge and also may then be required to further investigate it.

1491
03:24:11,588 --> 03:24:17,218
So that's why giving it to the reporting party is usually the best practice to make sure that that happens.

1492
03:24:18,285 --> 03:24:19,065
Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

1493
03:24:19,386 --> 03:24:20,826
Did you want to say, member Graham?

1494
03:24:22,147 --> 03:24:22,688
Thank you.

1495
03:24:22,708 --> 03:24:31,353
I think the other thing, the rules and policy subcommittee is working on a refresh of the bullying policy.

1496
03:24:31,493 --> 03:24:43,920
And we had a lot of conversation in the last meeting that we held around the district's obligations in terms of awareness and making sure people understand the steps

1497
03:24:46,417 --> 03:25:00,388
and making sure that there's some proactive measure happening when parents are talking about or students are talking about how they may be struggling so that people know what those options are and what the protocol is.

1498
03:25:00,468 --> 03:25:06,012
So I do think that the revised policy that comes out will have

1499
03:25:07,074 --> 03:25:11,598
some additional steps to try to like close the gap, because I think the gap that Ms.

1500
03:25:11,618 --> 03:25:17,443
Brandley is talking about is real, which is if you didn't know that that was the thing you were supposed to do, you didn't do it.

1501
03:25:17,543 --> 03:25:25,790
And we can't, we can't know how many people fall into that situation, but we can be aware that it happens.

1502
03:25:25,950 --> 03:25:30,674
It happened at least, you know, we're hearing that from one person, but we have heard that from many people.

1503
03:25:32,136 --> 03:25:34,678
And I think as we do finish the policy work,

1504
03:25:35,219 --> 03:26:00,071
it'll be important to make sure that when we talk about that policy and the translation to practice, that there is a way to sort of close that gap that doesn't dilute the meaningfulness of the information that you need to actually properly investigate a bullying report, but does close the gap around the unreported, which is what's really, really hard to get at.

1505
03:26:01,092 --> 03:26:01,412
Thank you.

1506
03:26:02,492 --> 03:26:02,752
Thank you.

1507
03:26:02,832 --> 03:26:03,853
Member McLaughlin?

1508
03:26:05,134 --> 03:26:05,814
Yes, thank you.

1509
03:26:06,555 --> 03:26:11,037
Yeah, and I think that really parent information is obviously very important.

1510
03:26:11,097 --> 03:26:21,743
We had a training last week that Medford Public Schools collaborated with on the CPAC for a training for parents and professionals on bullying, and I think that having

1511
03:26:22,441 --> 03:26:23,882
more of those is important.

1512
03:26:23,982 --> 03:26:31,067
And, you know, again, even, you know, quarterly or at the beginning of the year and middle of the year or something so that folks do know this.

1513
03:26:31,167 --> 03:26:41,054
And I think we just have to also keep an open mind and ask ourselves if we're doing that, how we're getting that information translated to families that need to know.

1514
03:26:41,174 --> 03:26:45,597
So all part of the process, I think, as we're looking at the policy piece.

1515
03:26:46,558 --> 03:26:46,978
Thank you.

1516
03:26:47,198 --> 03:26:47,839
Thank you very much.

1517
03:26:48,339 --> 03:26:49,340
Thank you for the report.

1518
03:26:50,097 --> 03:27:03,051
We have one condolence of the Medford School Committee expressions its sincere condolences to the family of Anthony A. Teixeira Jr., United States Navy veteran and father of ESL Director Paul Teixeira.

1519
03:27:03,071 --> 03:27:04,913
If we all may rise for a moment of silence.

1520
03:27:17,810 --> 03:27:18,091
Thank you.

1521
03:27:18,652 --> 03:27:26,285
Our next regular meeting, which is the sixth regular meeting of the school committee, will be held on April 3rd in the chambers, also on Zoom.

1522
03:27:28,910 --> 03:27:30,913
Is there a motion for... Motion to adjourn.

1523
03:27:31,414 --> 03:27:34,780
Motion to adjourn by Member Graham, seconded by Member Kretz.

1524
03:27:35,000 --> 03:27:35,301
All those in
