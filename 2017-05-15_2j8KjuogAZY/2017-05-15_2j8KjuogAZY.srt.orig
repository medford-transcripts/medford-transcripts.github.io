00:09:23,224 --> 00:09:30,470

[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

36
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:31,731

42
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:07,763
[SPEAKER_09]: This program is for students for grades seven through 12, and all writing pieces are judged on originality, technical skill,

43
00:10:08,347 --> 00:10:10,188
[SPEAKER_09]: and the emergence of personal voice.

44
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:20,214
[SPEAKER_09]: At the national level, we do have students who won a gold key and a silver key have the opportunity to submit nationally.

45
00:10:20,695 --> 00:10:31,061
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm very pleased to say that in addition to all of the state recipients that we'll honor tonight, we also have a silver medal for a student that won the national competition.

46
00:10:31,121 --> 00:10:32,622
[SPEAKER_09]: So she will be called up as well.

47
00:10:33,255 --> 00:10:40,338
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to thank, before we call the students, all the teachers who worked tirelessly to help with the students with the written production.

48
00:10:40,878 --> 00:10:43,939
[SPEAKER_09]: We have Miss Lou and we have Mr. Morris who are here tonight.

49
00:10:44,059 --> 00:10:47,100
[SPEAKER_09]: We also have Mr. Bowen Flynn, Mr. Heinegg.

50
00:10:54,282 --> 00:11:01,225
[SPEAKER_09]: Miss Zeckman from the middle school, Miss Stevens, Mr. Heinegg, I said, Mr. Bowen Flynn,

51
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:04,248
[SPEAKER_09]: and Miss Sanford, who worked with the students.

52
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:12,531
[SPEAKER_09]: So if we can call the students up, I think you'll begin first with the National Silver Medal, and then they'll go from there.

53
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:13,751
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

54
00:11:13,771 --> 00:11:16,052

258
00:35:53,013 --> 00:36:04,819
[SPEAKER_09]: Amin only missed one question, and he also chose to take the challenge round, which meant that he actually answered all of the questions from the final round, and he did so correctly.

00:36:09,295 --> 00:36:10,335

[SPEAKER_02]: Congratulations, Pedra.

346
00:43:13,355 --> 00:43:20,000
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed that it said that the students' work would be posted on our website with their parents' permission.

347
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:25,344
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have to say, when it was posted last year, I read every one, and it was great.

348
00:43:25,724 --> 00:43:30,227
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really hope that parents should give permission so that we can read your students' work.

349
00:43:30,688 --> 00:43:31,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for mentioning that.

350
00:43:31,949 --> 00:43:32,329

[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

354
00:43:38,035 --> 00:43:39,716
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe Mr. Cieri is in the audience.

355
00:43:39,957 --> 00:43:40,357
[SPEAKER_08]: There he is.

356
00:43:40,377 --> 00:43:45,201
[SPEAKER_08]: We're gonna do the Medford High School Science Fair Awards next.

357
00:43:46,802 --> 00:43:47,703
[SPEAKER_10]: Good evening, everyone.

358
00:43:47,723 --> 00:43:55,169
[SPEAKER_10]: 48 Medford High School students participated in the annual Science Fair at Medford High School this year.

359
00:43:56,350 --> 00:44:00,974
[SPEAKER_10]: From our event, a select number of students move on to regional and state events.

360
00:44:01,775 --> 00:44:04,357
[SPEAKER_10]: These events go from March all the way to May.

361
00:44:04,797 --> 00:44:06,178
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, last week,

362
00:44:07,742 --> 00:44:12,684
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it was last Saturday, not this past Saturday, it was the very final event, which was the state fair.

363
00:44:12,784 --> 00:44:20,107
[SPEAKER_10]: So there are a large number of events that students pass through in order to qualify for each level.

364
00:44:21,208 --> 00:44:26,610
[SPEAKER_10]: At the regional fair, there are two students that placed in the top 26.

365
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:35,114
[SPEAKER_10]: Those students moved on to the state fair, and they placed there as well this past week, so we're really excited to be able to present our awards tonight.

366
00:44:35,893 --> 00:44:42,525
[SPEAKER_10]: to all the students that won an award at our fair, and to recognize those students that participated in the regional and state fair.

[SPEAKER_10]: Albert and Joseph both continued on to the regional and the state fair and were placed in both.

394
00:48:45,227 --> 00:48:45,587

395
00:48:46,728 --> 00:48:50,250

00:49:03,962 --> 00:49:04,805
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening, Miss Joy.

00:49:05,086 --> 00:49:05,828
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening.

399
00:49:06,430 --> 00:49:09,299
[SPEAKER_13]: We're very proud of this group of students that we

400
00:49:09,784 --> 00:49:16,625
[SPEAKER_13]: bring before you tonight, and you've seen some familiar faces that tells you a little bit of how well-rounded these students are.

401
00:49:18,286 --> 00:49:31,349
[SPEAKER_13]: They competed this year at the 2017 Greater New England Regional Bot Ball Tournament at the University of Massachusetts Lowell on Saturday, April 29.

402
00:49:32,049 --> 00:49:36,090
[SPEAKER_13]: The team, under the advisership of mathematics teacher, Ms.

403
00:49:36,130 --> 00:49:36,990
[SPEAKER_13]: Barbara Chen,

404
00:49:37,990 --> 00:49:47,301
[SPEAKER_13]: With the support from My Day, Technology of Medford proudly brought back four awards to the district.

405
00:49:48,262 --> 00:49:53,829
[SPEAKER_13]: First, they scored a second place overall trophy.

406
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:57,694
[SPEAKER_13]: Secondly, a Spirit of Botball trophy.

407
00:49:58,771 --> 00:50:05,796
[SPEAKER_13]: a seedling third place certificate, and double elimination third place certificate.

408
00:50:06,437 --> 00:50:15,483
[SPEAKER_13]: The team finished second overall out of 18 teams, and this is over all of New England.

409
00:50:15,563 --> 00:50:27,292
[SPEAKER_13]: The overall winners for the ball are determined by their double elimination rank, seedling round scores online, and onsite documentation scores.

410
00:50:27,975 --> 00:50:37,241
[SPEAKER_13]: In the seeding, the teams run their robots unopposed in an attempt to score the most points possible.

411
00:50:37,922 --> 00:50:50,731
[SPEAKER_13]: In double elimination, the robots from two different teams compete on the game table simultaneously in an effort to score as many points as possible, but also

412
00:50:51,291 --> 00:50:53,715
[SPEAKER_13]: to keep their opponent from scoring.

413
00:50:54,636 --> 00:51:03,688
[SPEAKER_13]: In the category of judges' choice trophies, the judges singled out Medford's team for the Spirit of Ball Ball award.

414
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:10,122
[SPEAKER_13]: So we would like to congratulate the team members for their hard work, determination, and perseverance.

415
00:51:10,202 --> 00:51:12,442
[SPEAKER_13]: They were here many, many long nights.

416
00:51:13,103 --> 00:51:13,443
[SPEAKER_13]: And Ms.

417
00:51:13,483 --> 00:51:20,785
[SPEAKER_13]: Barbara Chen for her leadership and oversight, and parents, guardians, and community members for their support.

418
00:51:30,827 --> 00:51:32,928
[SPEAKER_08]: Our first recipient is Ms.

419
00:51:32,988 --> 00:51:34,389
[SPEAKER_08]: Barbara Chin, advisor.

420
00:51:45,253 --> 00:51:45,854
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice job.

421
00:51:46,234 --> 00:51:48,615
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you like to say a few words?

422
00:51:48,635 --> 00:51:50,236
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you like to speak?

423
00:51:50,316 --> 00:51:51,336
[SPEAKER_01]: Either one, you can use either one.

424
00:51:52,517 --> 00:51:55,018
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so proud of the team.

425
00:51:55,238 --> 00:51:57,579
[SPEAKER_01]: The students work very, very hard, okay?

426
00:51:57,619 --> 00:51:59,980
[SPEAKER_01]: They take a lot of determination and

427
00:52:00,805 --> 00:52:09,232
[SPEAKER_01]: and also persevere, and also they have to make a lot of decision on their own because adults are not supposed to be involved in the competition.

428
00:52:09,493 --> 00:52:15,338
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they have to decide which strategy to use, whose strategy to use, okay?

429
00:52:15,378 --> 00:52:17,720
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have a lot of times to work as a team.

430
00:52:18,781 --> 00:52:26,988
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is time for them to develop, work together, collaboratively, and they enjoy working together.

[SPEAKER_11]: Congratulations.

454
00:55:39,896 --> 00:55:40,417
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.

455
00:55:40,477 --> 00:55:41,537
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Superintendent.

456
00:55:41,917 --> 00:55:48,899
[SPEAKER_11]: Dear members of the school committee, ladies and gentlemen, as you look around, you see the incredible achievements of our young people.

457
00:55:49,559 --> 00:55:52,680
[SPEAKER_11]: But also very important, two things that I want to highlight.

458
00:55:53,341 --> 00:55:57,882
[SPEAKER_11]: One, the diversity of our student body and the achievements of this diversity.

459
00:56:02,222 --> 00:56:06,526
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that's one of the factors that makes Medford so great and a great place to grow up.

460
00:56:07,006 --> 00:56:11,330
[SPEAKER_11]: Because you get to grow up and experience a lot of different cultures and work together.

461
00:56:11,791 --> 00:56:16,295
[SPEAKER_11]: And the second key thing is that all of these achievements come through collaboration.

462
00:56:16,947 --> 00:56:20,808
[SPEAKER_11]: working together with your teachers, working with each other, working as a team.

463
00:56:21,569 --> 00:56:23,569
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's the secret to success in almost anything.

464
00:56:24,090 --> 00:56:27,591
[SPEAKER_11]: Very few people do anything alone by themselves without good help.

465
00:56:28,291 --> 00:56:30,652
[SPEAKER_11]: And so congratulations to all of you, to your parents.

466
00:56:31,272 --> 00:56:32,533
[SPEAKER_11]: They've collaborated with you.

467
00:56:32,573 --> 00:56:33,713
[SPEAKER_11]: You've collaborated with them.

468
00:56:33,753 --> 00:56:35,134
[SPEAKER_11]: You've collaborated with each other.

469
00:56:35,874 --> 00:56:43,457
[SPEAKER_11]: And you make Medford very proud of the way you represent us, both as a diverse community and as a community that cares about its people.

470
00:56:43,737 --> 00:56:44,057
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

471
00:56:52,263 --> 00:56:55,104
[SPEAKER_08]: And we have to send a thank you to the parents, of course.

472
00:56:55,204 --> 00:56:59,207
[SPEAKER_08]: Without their support, some of these things would not come to fruition.

473
00:56:59,227 --> 00:57:02,388
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you parents out there and everyone who has raised a child.

474
00:57:06,610 --> 00:57:08,551
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, we'll revert to the regular order of business.

475
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:09,612
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a motion by Ms.

476
00:57:09,632 --> 00:57:10,152
[SPEAKER_08]: Mustone?

477
00:57:10,612 --> 00:57:11,513
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe that's it.

478
00:57:11,573 --> 00:57:11,973
[SPEAKER_08]: Is someone?

479
00:57:12,673 --> 00:57:13,053
[SPEAKER_08]: Seconded.

480
00:57:13,394 --> 00:57:14,214
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

481
00:57:14,934 --> 00:57:15,695
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

482
00:57:17,472 --> 00:57:17,592
Yeah.

483
00:57:18,813 --> 00:57:21,715
[SPEAKER_08]: Approval of the minutes of May 1st, 2017.

484
00:57:21,775 --> 00:57:22,436
[SPEAKER_08]: Approval by Ms.

485
00:57:22,476 --> 00:57:24,117
[SPEAKER_08]: Disceri, seconded by Ms.

486
00:57:24,197 --> 00:57:24,718
[SPEAKER_08]: Cuno.

487
00:57:24,778 --> 00:57:25,639
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

488
00:57:26,479 --> 00:57:27,220
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

489
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:28,060
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion passes.

490
00:57:29,982 --> 00:57:30,462
[SPEAKER_08]: Congrats.

491
00:57:32,884 --> 00:57:34,966
[SPEAKER_08]: Approval of bills, transfer of funds.

492
00:57:35,046 --> 00:57:36,207
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion for approval by Ms.

493
00:57:36,227 --> 00:57:38,369
[SPEAKER_08]: Disceri, seconded by Ms.

494
00:57:38,389 --> 00:57:39,009
[SPEAKER_08]: DiBenedetto.

495
00:57:43,452 --> 00:57:44,273
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Benedetto.

496
00:57:44,833 --> 00:57:51,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, on page 3 of 13, there's an amount of $2,188.17 for Frank D'Alessaro.

497
00:57:51,237 --> 00:57:57,662
[SPEAKER_06]: It says student activities.

498
00:57:58,042 --> 00:58:00,023
[SPEAKER_06]: That seemed like a lot for a student.

499
00:58:00,043 --> 00:58:00,243
[SPEAKER_06]: Page 13?

500
00:58:00,284 --> 00:58:00,384
[SPEAKER_06]: 3 of 13.

501
00:58:00,504 --> 00:58:00,744
[SPEAKER_06]: 3 of 13.

502
00:58:01,104 --> 00:58:03,065
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Delosio is in charge of the Mustang Mall.

503
00:58:06,061 --> 00:58:10,485
[SPEAKER_11]: And so undoubtedly this is reimbursement for product that he had to buy on behalf of that activity.

504
00:58:10,525 --> 00:58:10,945
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

505
00:58:11,546 --> 00:58:25,658
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I had a couple others, Mr. Bellson, if you don't mind on page six of 13 and uh, um, method high miscellaneous charges.

506
00:58:25,818 --> 00:58:28,580
[SPEAKER_06]: It's woodwind in brass, uh, wind, 2,125.

507
00:58:31,919 --> 00:58:38,000
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that for equipment for our high school band, or it just says miscellaneous charges.

508
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:40,461
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like directed to a department or anything.

509
00:58:40,481 --> 00:58:41,261
[SPEAKER_06]: It said page six.

510
00:58:41,801 --> 00:58:45,442
[SPEAKER_06]: Page six of 13, three quarts, it's about eight.

511
00:58:45,462 --> 00:58:48,142
[SPEAKER_08]: Woodwind and brass swing, measure high, miscellaneous charges.

512
00:58:48,283 --> 00:58:52,323
[SPEAKER_11]: That's undoubtedly to support the woodwind orchestra activities.

513
00:58:53,324 --> 00:58:58,665
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, it just seemed unusual to have a miscellaneous charge of that amount.

514
00:58:58,985 --> 00:58:59,925
[SPEAKER_06]: No, on account.

515
00:59:00,865 --> 00:59:01,005
[SPEAKER_02]: Ms.

516
00:59:01,045 --> 00:59:02,346
[SPEAKER_02]: VandeGlue, point of information?

517
00:59:02,366 --> 00:59:02,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

518
00:59:02,727 --> 00:59:07,811
[SPEAKER_02]: As a secretary, when I signed the bills, I remember signing that and looking at it specifically.

519
00:59:07,831 --> 00:59:10,693
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to tell you, because it's two weeks ago, I don't remember what it was.

520
00:59:10,733 --> 00:59:17,559
[SPEAKER_02]: But I specifically looked at it and checked it, because I, too, was like, the way that it was categorized seemed funny.

521
00:59:17,579 --> 00:59:21,022
[SPEAKER_02]: But once I saw what it was, it made perfect sense.

522
00:59:21,362 --> 00:59:21,643
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

523
00:59:23,324 --> 00:59:24,005
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, did we?

524
00:59:24,325 --> 00:59:25,906
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, I'll ask at the end of this.

525
00:59:27,168 --> 00:59:31,411
[SPEAKER_06]: In relation to that, I was just wondering if we sold any of the pieces as well as any of that.

526
00:59:31,471 --> 00:59:34,493
[SPEAKER_11]: On Saturday, we actually, everything was sold at auction.

527
00:59:34,994 --> 00:59:42,639
[SPEAKER_11]: And I believe that, um, pre discount pre, you know, the auctioneer's price, which is 10% that they brought in about $20,000.

528
00:59:42,679 --> 00:59:42,879
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

529
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:44,620
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we'll get a report.

530
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:46,021
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll get a report on that.

531
00:59:46,121 --> 00:59:46,542
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

532
00:59:46,562 --> 00:59:47,402
[SPEAKER_11]: Happened on the Saturday.

533
00:59:47,422 --> 00:59:48,323
[SPEAKER_11]: So we need a little more time.

534
00:59:48,663 --> 00:59:53,046
[SPEAKER_06]: And then my, my last question is the last two items on, on the list on page 13 of 13.

535
00:59:53,126 --> 00:59:53,567
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's, um,

536
00:59:56,653 --> 01:00:04,741
[SPEAKER_06]: Professional tech services, educational, and there's a person's name with the amount of like $2,500 total.

537
01:00:04,881 --> 01:00:08,444
[SPEAKER_11]: Trying to, where is this again?

538
01:00:08,504 --> 01:00:09,705
[SPEAKER_06]: The last two line items.

539
01:00:09,745 --> 01:00:11,067
[SPEAKER_08]: Last two items, last page.

540
01:00:11,267 --> 01:00:11,707
[SPEAKER_08]: Zenia.

541
01:00:12,768 --> 01:00:13,169
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

542
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:15,050
[SPEAKER_06]: On page what?

543
01:00:15,531 --> 01:00:16,191
[SPEAKER_06]: The last page.

544
01:00:16,231 --> 01:00:16,792
[SPEAKER_06]: Page 13 of 13.

545
01:00:18,754 --> 01:00:19,995
[SPEAKER_06]: Last two items listed.

546
01:00:20,355 --> 01:00:20,876
[SPEAKER_06]: The last two.

547
01:00:21,702 --> 01:00:25,403
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll just have to look that up when we get back to the office.

548
01:00:25,464 --> 01:00:26,584
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a weird number, 112.

549
01:00:26,724 --> 01:00:28,365
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like a grand capital account.

550
01:00:28,645 --> 01:00:28,905
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

551
01:00:29,605 --> 01:00:31,806
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I was just kind of looking for that item.

552
01:00:32,406 --> 01:00:34,327
[SPEAKER_08]: On the second, motion for approval.

553
01:00:34,487 --> 01:00:35,307
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

554
01:00:35,608 --> 01:00:35,688
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

555
01:00:35,948 --> 01:00:36,648
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

556
01:00:36,688 --> 01:00:37,468
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion passes.

557
01:00:39,389 --> 01:00:40,509
[SPEAKER_08]: Approval of payrolls.

558
01:00:41,330 --> 01:00:43,231
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion for approval, seconded by Ms.

559
01:00:43,271 --> 01:00:43,691
[SPEAKER_08]: Cuneo.

560
01:00:43,731 --> 01:00:44,491
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

561
01:00:44,871 --> 01:00:44,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

562
01:00:45,231 --> 01:00:45,992
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

563
01:00:46,232 --> 01:00:46,952
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion passes.

564
01:00:47,472 --> 01:00:48,533
[SPEAKER_08]: Report of secretary.

565
01:00:48,713 --> 01:00:49,233
[SPEAKER_02]: There is none.

566
01:00:50,778 --> 01:00:52,999
[SPEAKER_08]: Report of committees, Committee of the Whole, May 10th, 2017.

567
01:00:53,139 --> 01:00:55,140
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Superintendent.

568
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:56,760
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it's right here.

569
01:00:57,240 --> 01:01:03,262
[SPEAKER_11]: Mayor and members of the committee, this is the Committee of the Whole that we held last Wednesday on the school councils.

570
01:01:03,462 --> 01:01:04,163
[SPEAKER_11]: It's here.

571
01:01:04,723 --> 01:01:17,027
[SPEAKER_11]: Rather than read it in totality, if anyone has any particular questions, if there's anything in it, you can certainly respond to it, but I think it's self-explanatory and we'll just enter it into the record with your approval.

572
01:01:18,607 --> 01:01:19,348
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Benedetto.

573
01:01:20,875 --> 01:01:27,397
[SPEAKER_06]: I know at this meeting we had a very productive meeting and we met with all the principals as well as some teaching staff.

574
01:01:27,837 --> 01:01:36,219
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was really good insight as to what's going on at each building and how they use the funds that they were allocated this year and what they need for next year.

575
01:01:36,259 --> 01:01:38,980
[SPEAKER_06]: And I appreciate the manner in which it's all presented.

576
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:42,421
[SPEAKER_06]: But at that meeting we were supposed to have a secondary agenda item.

577
01:01:42,801 --> 01:01:48,065
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's not listed in the minutes, and it wasn't presented at that night, the PTO information.

578
01:01:48,345 --> 01:01:55,930
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would like it added to the minutes because we had moved that report to the subcommittee meeting, and then it didn't happen at subcommittee meeting.

579
01:01:56,230 --> 01:01:58,472
[SPEAKER_06]: So I want it noted that it didn't happen there.

580
01:01:58,932 --> 01:02:05,597
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you could amend these notes and bring them back to us at our next meeting for approval, I'd be happy with the new report.

581
01:02:05,637 --> 01:02:07,158
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still under request of report.

582
01:02:08,478 --> 01:02:17,240
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, but I want it noted that it was discussed this evening in that it was supposed to be, uh, discussed and brought up at that subcommittee meeting.

583
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:20,820
[SPEAKER_08]: And it wasn't on the motion as amended for the committee of the whole report.

584
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:21,901
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor.

585
01:02:22,741 --> 01:02:23,481
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed.

586
01:02:23,521 --> 01:02:24,281
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion passes.

587
01:02:24,521 --> 01:02:24,961
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

588
01:02:26,742 --> 01:02:34,683
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. Scary in reference to our committee, the whole meeting and through you to the superintendent, after going through,

589
01:02:35,076 --> 01:02:46,060
[SPEAKER_12]: thoroughly in these reports for many years, Mr. Superintendent, it seems that, uh, this school year there was a, uh, an under, uh, amount of parent involvement and community reps.

590
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:55,023
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was wondering if we could instill in our principals to kindly build up the, uh, parents that, uh, advised them during the, uh, the year.

591
01:02:55,103 --> 01:03:02,766
[SPEAKER_12]: And if we could get some, yeah, if we could get some more, uh, uh, commitment from the community to, uh, work on these school plans and, uh, hopefully,

592
01:03:03,648 --> 01:03:05,089
[SPEAKER_12]: keep up the good work that we're doing.

593
01:03:06,189 --> 01:03:15,134
[SPEAKER_12]: I realize it's tough, but I really think there should be a fair amount of parent participation in these meetings during the year when they present their findings to us.

594
01:03:15,535 --> 01:03:17,056
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just would comment on that.

595
01:03:17,156 --> 01:03:22,098
[SPEAKER_11]: The parents participated in the council development.

596
01:03:22,719 --> 01:03:26,601
[SPEAKER_11]: The attendance at the presentation on Wednesday evening,

597
01:03:27,277 --> 01:03:29,238
[SPEAKER_11]: was dependent on the school itself.

598
01:03:29,799 --> 01:03:31,980
[SPEAKER_11]: And several parents were there and were introduced.

599
01:03:32,661 --> 01:03:37,825
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, one school did not have anyone there specifically except one member who's actually a member of the school committee.

600
01:03:37,965 --> 01:03:38,145
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

601
01:03:38,265 --> 01:03:43,629
[SPEAKER_11]: But other than that, each school did introduce people and there are like seven members on a council.

602
01:03:43,669 --> 01:03:46,591
[SPEAKER_11]: So it isn't like this, like there's 50 people on a council.

603
01:03:46,631 --> 01:03:53,536
[SPEAKER_12]: But I hear what you're saying and certainly will, you know, there should be more parent input if we're going to foster transparency.

604
01:03:54,457 --> 01:03:55,298
[SPEAKER_11]: It's in the report.

605
01:03:55,318 --> 01:04:00,944
[SPEAKER_11]: I would hope that the councils would actually consult with the parents more completely, but it's a seven-member council.

606
01:04:00,984 --> 01:04:04,087
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, theoretically the report reflects them.

607
01:04:04,107 --> 01:04:06,730
[SPEAKER_11]: The high school and the voc have students on it, but the other

608
01:04:07,462 --> 01:04:10,343
[SPEAKER_11]: are strictly parents and community members.

609
01:04:10,423 --> 01:04:14,624
[SPEAKER_12]: Just as one community member, I'd like to see more parent involvement in their kid's education.

610
01:04:15,284 --> 01:04:16,204
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

611
01:04:16,384 --> 01:04:16,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

612
01:04:16,624 --> 01:04:17,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Cuno, then Ms.

613
01:04:17,765 --> 01:04:18,225
[SPEAKER_05]: Van de Kloot.

614
01:04:18,665 --> 01:04:21,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, just points of information on the site councils.

615
01:04:22,346 --> 01:04:34,469
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the schools actually, if I'm not mistaken, I don't know if it was all the elementary schools, it's been a while, but I do know that at the beginning of the year, they have some type of almost, I don't want to say an election, but they do have,

616
01:04:35,649 --> 01:04:57,964
[SPEAKER_05]: The letters that go out to the parents asking if they are Interested in joining and then if they do get too many parents because I guess the bylaws does say that there's supposed to be a certain amount on the site councils That that's when it is brought into some type of an election or a voting system in each school over the years I have been involved I've

617
01:04:58,509 --> 01:05:00,391
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I know that that's how it's worked.

618
01:05:00,571 --> 01:05:04,874
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that that's how it's worked in the middle schools and in the high school vocational side.

619
01:05:05,295 --> 01:05:10,499
[SPEAKER_05]: I do want to mention that this year, the last actually couple of years, the high school and the vocational side.

620
01:05:10,903 --> 01:05:26,490
[SPEAKER_05]: have had a lot more parent participation than we've ever had from both sides over the years, unfortunately, depending on people's schedules, too, everybody's busy, that we have not had as many from the vocational side on the site council side, on the high school side.

621
01:05:26,830 --> 01:05:28,350
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was just point of information.

622
01:05:29,491 --> 01:05:29,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

623
01:05:29,711 --> 01:05:30,191
[SPEAKER_05]: van de Kloot.

624
01:05:30,871 --> 01:05:35,613
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed at the end of the minutes of the meeting that there were various different items that were discussed.

625
01:05:36,054 --> 01:05:38,815
[SPEAKER_02]: And one, we had spent considerable time at an earlier

626
01:05:40,105 --> 01:05:43,086
[SPEAKER_02]: broadcasts on TV publicly, so I just want to read it for the record.

627
01:05:44,286 --> 01:05:48,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Meeting with Attorney General clarified the B-1, B-2 enforcement issue.

628
01:05:48,987 --> 01:05:53,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Schools are not an agent of the federal government for the enforcement of immigration law.

629
01:05:53,567 --> 01:05:57,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Therefore, our schools do not have to remove any existing B-1, B-2 students.

630
01:05:58,128 --> 01:06:05,330
[SPEAKER_02]: This was a concern among many of the members, if all the members of the school committee, so I'm just glad to see that that was resolved.

631
01:06:05,910 --> 01:06:07,090
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, as a question on

632
01:06:08,263 --> 01:06:15,385
[SPEAKER_02]: see that there was discussion to allow direct appointment of fine arts director and the technology director by the superintendent.

633
01:06:15,665 --> 01:06:20,046
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to ask the superintendent if he's made those appointments yet.

634
01:06:20,406 --> 01:06:24,787
[SPEAKER_11]: The appointment letters are now in process and probably will go out either this week or the beginning of next.

635
01:06:25,168 --> 01:06:25,248
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

636
01:06:25,608 --> 01:06:25,908
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

637
01:06:26,968 --> 01:06:27,368
[SPEAKER_08]: Very good.

638
01:06:27,608 --> 01:06:28,268
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

639
01:06:28,949 --> 01:06:30,389
[SPEAKER_08]: Community participation.

640
01:06:30,449 --> 01:06:32,429
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there anyone wishing to speak this evening?

641
01:06:33,930 --> 01:06:34,270
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyone?

642
01:06:36,632 --> 01:06:37,872
[SPEAKER_02]: Did we make a motion to accept these?

643
01:06:37,892 --> 01:06:41,414
[SPEAKER_02]: We did make a motion, yeah.

644
01:06:41,454 --> 01:06:43,095
[SPEAKER_08]: Reports of the superintendent.

645
01:06:43,175 --> 01:06:45,917
[SPEAKER_08]: Pre-budget report, English Language Arts.

646
01:06:46,617 --> 01:06:47,317
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Superintendent.

647
01:06:47,337 --> 01:06:52,880
[SPEAKER_11]: We call upon our Director of English Language Arts and Humanities, Dr. Nicole Chiesa.

648
01:06:59,384 --> 01:07:00,384
[SPEAKER_08]: Dr. Chiesa.

649
01:07:00,424 --> 01:07:01,445
[SPEAKER_08]: Good evening again.

650
01:07:04,748 --> 01:07:08,310
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it possible to give the Ethics Bowl update prior to going into the pre-budget report?

651
01:07:08,430 --> 01:07:08,750
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

652
01:07:09,451 --> 01:07:16,355
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to update you all on the Ethics Bowl competition that occurred in North Carolina during the weekend of April 8th.

653
01:07:16,855 --> 01:07:24,400
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks to the generosity of the Medford School Committee, our Medford High School Ethics Bowl traveled to University of North Carolina Chapel Hill.

654
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:31,604
[SPEAKER_09]: When they were there, they participated in the 2017 National High School Ethics Bowl competition along with 24 other schools.

655
01:07:34,078 --> 01:07:36,059
[SPEAKER_09]: They won two rounds unanimously.

656
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:40,041
[SPEAKER_09]: They lost the third round just by one point.

657
01:07:40,722 --> 01:07:46,885
[SPEAKER_09]: And when they tally up the points to make it to the final round, they just fell short just a little bit.

658
01:07:47,705 --> 01:07:52,588
[SPEAKER_09]: Their poise, their character, and their skill was unprecedented.

659
01:07:53,048 --> 01:07:56,249
[SPEAKER_09]: And I want to thank Mr. Esner, who led that group, and Ms.

660
01:07:56,310 --> 01:07:58,691
[SPEAKER_09]: Parsons, who chaperoned the group as well.

661
01:07:59,151 --> 01:08:03,093
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm very proud to say that the Medford Ethics Bowl team

662
01:08:03,514 --> 01:08:05,375
[SPEAKER_09]: finished in the top 10 in the nation.

663
01:08:05,955 --> 01:08:08,677
[SPEAKER_09]: And that is impressive beyond me.

664
01:08:08,717 --> 01:08:12,159
[SPEAKER_09]: And so thank you for your generosity in supporting the students.

665
01:08:12,359 --> 01:08:13,520
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a wonderful trip.

666
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:16,061
[SPEAKER_09]: And we all greatly appreciate it.

667
01:08:16,721 --> 01:08:22,845
[SPEAKER_08]: And a few of the students that came up this evening were whispering in the superintendent my ear that they had placed in the top 10.

668
01:08:22,885 --> 01:08:24,806
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're very, very proud of that accomplishment.

669
01:08:24,826 --> 01:08:25,506
[SPEAKER_09]: That's wonderful.

670
01:08:25,526 --> 01:08:29,709
[SPEAKER_09]: And we didn't have certificates tonight because we had honored them in the past.

671
01:08:29,749 --> 01:08:31,970
[SPEAKER_09]: But I certainly want to make sure you had an update on that.

672
01:08:32,323 --> 01:08:33,003
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

673
01:08:33,083 --> 01:08:33,524
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

674
01:08:33,544 --> 01:08:33,584
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

675
01:08:36,285 --> 01:08:37,946
[SPEAKER_09]: So the English language arts budget.

676
01:08:39,187 --> 01:08:43,570
[SPEAKER_09]: The English language arts is dedicated to supporting all our teachers in the district.

677
01:08:44,270 --> 01:08:49,913
[SPEAKER_09]: Our curriculum is aligned to the 2011 Massachusetts English language arts curriculum framework.

678
01:08:51,354 --> 01:08:59,158
[SPEAKER_09]: At the elementary level our instructional materials include journeys 2014 and additional trade books at the middle and high school level.

679
01:08:59,279 --> 01:09:01,580
[SPEAKER_09]: We have Houghton Mifflin anthologies

680
01:09:02,172 --> 01:09:05,173
[SPEAKER_09]: periodicals, and fictional and non-fictional texts.

681
01:09:06,073 --> 01:09:10,395
[SPEAKER_09]: There are 29 teachers total in the middle school and high school.

682
01:09:12,776 --> 01:09:19,658
[SPEAKER_09]: And seven teachers at the Andrews, seven at the McGlynn, 13 at the high school, and two at the vocational school.

683
01:09:20,118 --> 01:09:24,880
[SPEAKER_09]: And one teacher, we have a, and two, excuse me, two at the vocational school.

684
01:09:26,140 --> 01:09:27,581
[SPEAKER_09]: This year in terms of funding,

685
01:09:28,128 --> 01:09:42,439
[SPEAKER_09]: We were able to purchase some additional Amazon Kindle Fires, which we have identified as being a great investment in terms of keeping the quality of the text compared to using it on the Kindle.

686
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:49,905
[SPEAKER_09]: We purchased some additional Journeys materials due to some rising numbers in the classrooms at the various grade levels.

687
01:09:51,125 --> 01:09:57,050
[SPEAKER_09]: Appropriated budget funding also supported the purchase of instructional materials at the middle and high school

688
01:09:57,612 --> 01:10:06,014
[SPEAKER_09]: including periodicals, and additional informational and fictional texts were purchased in order to allow for continuity among the grade levels.

689
01:10:08,355 --> 01:10:17,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Accomplishments for this year included continued implementation of over 100 e-readers at the high school and middle school level.

690
01:10:18,558 --> 01:10:26,400
[SPEAKER_09]: We continued to do some mock MCAS testing at the elementary and middle school to help comfort students as they prepare for this new

691
01:10:26,904 --> 01:10:28,284
[SPEAKER_09]: format in the exam.

692
01:10:29,305 --> 01:10:33,566
[SPEAKER_09]: We refined some different assessments based on curriculum needs and demands.

693
01:10:34,367 --> 01:10:40,669
[SPEAKER_09]: We stayed current with some recent changes that have just occurred to the 2011 ELA framework.

694
01:10:42,429 --> 01:10:48,671
[SPEAKER_09]: You saw many of the authentic learning opportunities tonight that we achieved great success with.

695
01:10:49,992 --> 01:10:56,134
[SPEAKER_09]: This year in terms of requesting for funding, I'm asking for an additional funds to purchase Study Island.

696
01:10:57,596 --> 01:10:58,457
[SPEAKER_09]: for the middle school.

697
01:10:59,759 --> 01:11:06,186
[SPEAKER_09]: And that would be supporting for the RTI piece at the middle school level for English.

698
01:11:06,427 --> 01:11:12,734
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm also asking for additional materials to support tier two and tier three intervention at the elementary level.

699
01:11:14,456 --> 01:11:17,720
[SPEAKER_09]: Not sure if anyone has any questions, but thank you for your time for that.

700
01:11:18,143 --> 01:11:18,523
[SPEAKER_08]: Are there any?

701
01:11:19,024 --> 01:11:22,106
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a motion to receive and place on file this report.

702
01:11:22,626 --> 01:11:23,127
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there any?

703
01:11:23,527 --> 01:11:24,288
[SPEAKER_08]: Seconded by Ms.

704
01:11:24,328 --> 01:11:24,628
[SPEAKER_08]: Kretz.

705
01:11:24,828 --> 01:11:25,649
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

706
01:11:26,289 --> 01:11:27,010
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

707
01:11:27,090 --> 01:11:27,790
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion passes.

708
01:11:28,831 --> 01:11:29,231
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

709
01:11:29,251 --> 01:11:29,912
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

710
01:11:31,673 --> 01:11:32,874
[SPEAKER_08]: One question, Mr. Benedetto.

711
01:11:33,354 --> 01:11:33,674
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

712
01:11:36,223 --> 01:11:44,368
[SPEAKER_06]: When we were talking last week with some of the principals, there was a strong request for RTI staff.

713
01:11:45,309 --> 01:11:45,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this $17,000?

714
01:11:46,189 --> 01:11:48,631
[SPEAKER_06]: What would that go towards?

715
01:11:48,951 --> 01:11:52,213
[SPEAKER_09]: Additional materials for the program.

716
01:11:52,373 --> 01:11:56,676
[SPEAKER_09]: There are quite a bit of tier two and tier three interventions.

717
01:11:56,756 --> 01:11:59,778
[SPEAKER_09]: We have them, but a lot of them are consumables.

718
01:12:00,238 --> 01:12:05,882
[SPEAKER_09]: For example, there's a write-in reader where in the paragraph it's highlighted for the child.

719
01:12:06,325 --> 01:12:08,126
[SPEAKER_09]: and the child can go in and underline.

720
01:12:08,406 --> 01:12:10,947
[SPEAKER_09]: So those are the consumables for the Tier 2 and Tier 3.

721
01:12:11,167 --> 01:12:13,968
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not talking staffing in that request.

722
01:12:14,228 --> 01:12:14,488
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

723
01:12:14,888 --> 01:12:19,330
[SPEAKER_06]: So there was a request for that, and there was a lot of talk about the need for that.

724
01:12:19,390 --> 01:12:23,011
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'd like your opinion on that.

725
01:12:23,331 --> 01:12:25,532
[SPEAKER_09]: In terms of staffing for intervention?

726
01:12:25,572 --> 01:12:26,172
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

727
01:12:26,312 --> 01:12:30,954
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that, first, we want to look at the logistics of the schedule.

728
01:12:30,994 --> 01:12:32,995
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've already engaged after that meeting.

729
01:12:35,174 --> 01:12:36,675
[SPEAKER_09]: received some of the feedback from that meeting.

730
01:12:38,035 --> 01:12:42,897
[SPEAKER_09]: I already spoke with some principals just in terms of organizing the schedule.

731
01:12:43,537 --> 01:12:49,000
[SPEAKER_09]: And I still I talked briefly with Miss Caldwell about Assistant Superintendent Caldwell about that which will engage more.

732
01:12:49,380 --> 01:12:51,721
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's logistically in terms of time.

733
01:12:52,121 --> 01:13:01,965
[SPEAKER_09]: If you can logistically put an RTI block in there where but the teachers do have the intervention tools and we have the program

734
01:13:02,810 --> 01:13:08,053
[SPEAKER_09]: in place with the existing interventions, that's the need for the additional cost.

735
01:13:08,633 --> 01:13:11,894
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't feel a need for additional staffing at this time.

736
01:13:11,994 --> 01:13:15,036
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to see how it works with the logistics.

737
01:13:15,056 --> 01:13:19,377
[SPEAKER_09]: We do it at the Andrews a lot in terms of scheduling that RTI block.

738
01:13:20,038 --> 01:13:22,939
[SPEAKER_09]: To me, that's step one in terms of getting that in.

739
01:13:23,319 --> 01:13:24,380
[SPEAKER_09]: Does that answer your question?

740
01:13:24,460 --> 01:13:25,000
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.

741
01:13:25,140 --> 01:13:25,400
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

742
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:31,763
[SPEAKER_06]: But what was helpful to me is that there were some teachers present and they

743
01:13:32,319 --> 01:13:35,061
[SPEAKER_06]: Explained that they do on their own time.

744
01:13:35,081 --> 01:13:56,532
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah early morning lunchtime And I know teachers do that in general and I know that not all teachers can do that because of their home situations They might not have that ability, you know young children different reasons that they can't and I just want to make sure that You know kids that need tier 2 and tier 3 they need more than the materials and some children, you know are

745
01:13:57,734 --> 01:14:02,238
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, we, what my goal here is to growth in MCAF scoring.

746
01:14:02,398 --> 01:14:15,248
[SPEAKER_06]: And I really believe that having people, you know, work with those kids that are so close to moving to the next level, that if we do have services in place that our schools will grow.

747
01:14:15,689 --> 01:14:23,395
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's, that's the community goal, not only the school committee goal or administrative goal or a teacher goal, you know, that's a community goal.

748
01:14:23,728 --> 01:14:33,737
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just want to make sure that if that's the need in order to make that growth happen, that we meet that need for the Tier 2 and Tier 3 children.

749
01:14:34,277 --> 01:14:46,007
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes, I know the superintendent talks a lot about differentiating instruction, and I agree with that wholeheartedly, but we're at a point now that we really need to make strides and want to make strides in growth.

750
01:14:46,445 --> 01:14:47,266
[SPEAKER_06]: with our scores.

751
01:14:47,346 --> 01:14:53,371
[SPEAKER_06]: And I, if this is the step necessary, I really would like to look at that before we close this budget.

752
01:14:53,551 --> 01:14:56,453
[SPEAKER_06]: So that way we can appropriate the correct funding for it.

753
01:14:56,834 --> 01:15:05,181
[SPEAKER_06]: So any time that you have to look at this prior to budget, I would like to hear from you and the administrative team.

754
01:15:05,221 --> 01:15:08,764
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys are the experts, but I also heard from the front lines already.

755
01:15:09,304 --> 01:15:11,206
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to take that very seriously as well.

756
01:15:12,225 --> 01:15:23,894
[SPEAKER_09]: If I may mention too, some of the tier two interventions that I'm referencing really give a targeted pre-assessment to figure out where the child is struggling in the reading.

757
01:15:24,034 --> 01:15:24,995
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it fluency?

758
01:15:25,035 --> 01:15:26,136
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it comprehension?

759
01:15:26,857 --> 01:15:33,962
[SPEAKER_09]: These materials can then help hone in on the child's need and the grouping and where they need that help.

760
01:15:34,302 --> 01:15:36,624
[SPEAKER_09]: But I have looked at it and I will look at it again.

761
01:15:36,744 --> 01:15:40,487
[SPEAKER_09]: Right now I feel like logistically we need to look at how the schedules align.

762
01:15:41,092 --> 01:15:41,972
[SPEAKER_09]: and go from there.

763
01:15:42,113 --> 01:15:45,714
[SPEAKER_09]: And I want to say thank you for all your support on that too.

764
01:15:45,974 --> 01:15:46,355
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

765
01:15:46,515 --> 01:15:46,895
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

766
01:15:47,915 --> 01:15:48,336
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

767
01:15:48,756 --> 01:15:53,418
[SPEAKER_06]: And I understand in ELA our scores are a little higher than they are in the math.

768
01:15:53,818 --> 01:16:05,043
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, I'm going to ask the same questions about math because district wide our math scores are good, but like there's room for growth in any situation.

769
01:16:05,164 --> 01:16:08,185
[SPEAKER_06]: So I know ELA, it might be a little different,

770
01:16:08,508 --> 01:16:11,371
[SPEAKER_06]: than it is the situation and the scenario with the mail.

771
01:16:11,871 --> 01:16:19,839
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you, and I look forward to hearing more from you before the budget about what you really think that we need to do.

772
01:16:20,059 --> 01:16:23,322
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just really want you to speak to some of the people on the front.

773
01:16:23,382 --> 01:16:24,604
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you do on a daily basis.

774
01:16:24,624 --> 01:16:28,567
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I followed up with a few after that meeting as well, and I will continue to do so.

775
01:16:28,768 --> 01:16:29,148
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

776
01:16:29,388 --> 01:16:29,649
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks.

777
01:16:29,689 --> 01:16:30,009
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

778
01:16:30,890 --> 01:16:32,171
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for the time, Mayor Berkley.

779
01:16:32,791 --> 01:16:33,252
[SPEAKER_08]: You're welcome.

780
01:16:33,452 --> 01:16:35,293
[SPEAKER_08]: We've already received and placed that on file.

781
01:16:35,353 --> 01:16:37,615
[SPEAKER_08]: Now the social studies pre-budget report.

782
01:16:38,115 --> 01:16:38,676
[SPEAKER_09]: Me again.

783
01:16:39,216 --> 01:16:40,837
[SPEAKER_09]: You'll be done with me soon.

784
01:16:41,878 --> 01:16:50,745
[SPEAKER_09]: The social studies department is committed to providing all students with the academic and problem solving skills essential for personal development, citizenship,

785
01:16:51,455 --> 01:16:52,416
[SPEAKER_09]: and lifelong learning.

786
01:16:53,316 --> 01:16:57,639
[SPEAKER_09]: We have 27.5 teachers combined in the middle and high school.

787
01:16:58,319 --> 01:17:07,985
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be six teachers at the Andrews Middle School, six teachers at the McGlynn Middle School, 14.5 at the high school, and one at the vocational school.

788
01:17:09,245 --> 01:17:18,991
[SPEAKER_09]: With the generous support of the school committee, in terms of funding for last year, we were able to purchase some additional eighth grade social studies textbooks, brand new for them.

789
01:17:19,869 --> 01:17:33,416
[SPEAKER_09]: We also purchased some additional online subscriptions for teachers because we find every day with social studies things are changing and the online subscriptions make a lot of sense in terms of keeping us current with what's going on in the world.

790
01:17:34,236 --> 01:17:42,741
[SPEAKER_09]: Appropriated budget funding also supported the purchase of instructional materials at the middle and high school level and we had some additional replacement textbooks.

791
01:17:43,641 --> 01:17:48,904
[SPEAKER_09]: In addition to that we purchased managing licenses for the Chromebooks in order to

792
01:17:50,791 --> 01:17:58,717
[SPEAKER_09]: ease any technology issues so we could look at it as a whole through the technology department.

793
01:17:58,857 --> 01:18:02,339
[SPEAKER_09]: And we also purchased some additional carts for the security of the Chromebooks.

794
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:06,582
[SPEAKER_09]: This is for the Global Scholars Program, which is offered at the seventh grade level.

795
01:18:07,763 --> 01:18:17,090
[SPEAKER_09]: Funding also supported numerous authentic learning opportunities, which is so powerful for these students, including the Model United Nations that you saw tonight,

796
01:18:18,445 --> 01:18:25,086
[SPEAKER_09]: We have the Royal House visits coming up for grade five and some other authentic opportunities as well.

797
01:18:25,707 --> 01:18:29,807
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course we had some periodicals that were purchased for the middle and high school level.

798
01:18:31,428 --> 01:18:39,469
[SPEAKER_09]: In terms of accomplishments for this year, I want to point out that we've had a significant increase in our senior year offerings.

799
01:18:39,929 --> 01:18:43,370
[SPEAKER_09]: In the past few years we've had four senior classes

800
01:18:44,258 --> 01:18:56,941
[SPEAKER_09]: that were either created or reinstated at the high school level that are fully, that are filled, not filled to capacity, they're not bursting at the seams, but they're very popular in choice for students.

801
01:18:56,981 --> 01:18:59,441
[SPEAKER_09]: That includes our honors economics class.

802
01:19:00,042 --> 01:19:03,462
[SPEAKER_09]: We brought back our AP comparative government class.

803
01:19:04,082 --> 01:19:06,643
[SPEAKER_09]: And so it's quite strong showing at the high school level.

804
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:21,153
[SPEAKER_09]: In addition, we also continued as another accomplishment to really support the Global Scholars Program, including a field trip to the Museum of Science this year, which was wonderful for the seventh grade students.

805
01:19:22,114 --> 01:19:30,943
[SPEAKER_09]: We've had a significant increase in community partnerships over the last year, including participating in our Veterans Day that you had a report on in the fall.

806
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:42,503
[SPEAKER_09]: Day on the Hill, National History Day at the middle and high school level, that model United Nations that we just honored students for, Law Day, Student Government Day.

807
01:19:43,083 --> 01:19:48,044
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a great experience for many different students in many different grade levels, which is important.

808
01:19:49,284 --> 01:19:56,806
[SPEAKER_09]: We continue to do full integration of grades 9 and 10 at the high school and vocational classes, and we continue with our inclusion.

809
01:19:57,843 --> 01:20:01,986
[SPEAKER_09]: full inclusion at the co-teaching classes for the high school and vocational.

810
01:20:03,567 --> 01:20:12,093
[SPEAKER_09]: This year, for additional funding, I am requesting $16,000 in additional funding for our grade 11 U.S.

811
01:20:12,133 --> 01:20:13,253
[SPEAKER_09]: history textbooks.

812
01:20:14,254 --> 01:20:22,420
[SPEAKER_09]: And the funding would also support an advanced placement human geography class that we are offering at the high school next year.

813
01:20:26,487 --> 01:20:26,847
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

814
01:20:27,908 --> 01:20:28,088
[SPEAKER_02]: Ms.

815
01:20:28,128 --> 01:20:28,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Van de Kloot.

816
01:20:29,068 --> 01:20:36,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Does the human geography course, will it be in place of one of the other AP courses or it's addition to?

817
01:20:36,451 --> 01:20:38,532
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't think it will be in place.

818
01:20:38,912 --> 01:20:43,694
[SPEAKER_09]: It might, we have to see where the numbers lie with the course requests.

819
01:20:43,754 --> 01:20:52,997
[SPEAKER_09]: I can tell you right now we have 45 students that have already requested it and our other senior classes still look quite strong in terms of participation.

820
01:20:53,037 --> 01:20:55,038
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're not pulling away that I can see.

821
01:20:55,813 --> 01:20:56,434
[SPEAKER_09]: from anything.

822
01:20:56,594 --> 01:21:07,081
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, if a child asks for AP Human Geography and honors econ, and for some reason the schedule was the same period, which we try to avoid, obviously, that would be the only way it would pull.

823
01:21:07,461 --> 01:21:09,262
[SPEAKER_09]: But no, this is just additional interest.

824
01:21:09,362 --> 01:21:09,743
[SPEAKER_09]: It's great.

825
01:21:09,763 --> 01:21:10,944
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

826
01:21:11,504 --> 01:21:12,184
[SPEAKER_09]: It's fabulous.

827
01:21:12,204 --> 01:21:12,725
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been great.

828
01:21:14,088 --> 01:21:14,588
[SPEAKER_08]: Very good.

829
01:21:14,908 --> 01:21:17,809
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a motion on the floor to receive in place on file by second?

830
01:21:17,829 --> 01:21:19,269
[SPEAKER_08]: You're seconded by Miss Van de Kloet.

831
01:21:19,709 --> 01:21:20,509
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor.

832
01:21:20,529 --> 01:21:20,969
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

833
01:21:21,229 --> 01:21:21,929
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed.

834
01:21:21,989 --> 01:21:22,589
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion passes.

835
01:21:22,609 --> 01:21:23,250
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

836
01:21:23,270 --> 01:21:24,670
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much for this evening.

837
01:21:24,750 --> 01:21:25,490
[SPEAKER_08]: Great job.

838
01:21:25,510 --> 01:21:26,110
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

839
01:21:26,290 --> 01:21:27,030
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

840
01:21:27,230 --> 01:21:32,571
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

841
01:21:32,611 --> 01:21:34,651
[SPEAKER_08]: Report on summer programs.

842
01:21:35,332 --> 01:21:39,472
[SPEAKER_11]: 2017 Mr. Superintendent call upon our deputy superintendent to present this report.

843
01:21:40,192 --> 01:21:40,372
[SPEAKER_08]: Ms.

844
01:21:40,412 --> 01:21:40,812
[SPEAKER_08]: Nelson.

845
01:21:42,453 --> 01:21:42,873
Good evening.

846
01:21:43,393 --> 01:21:43,853
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening.

847
01:21:44,786 --> 01:21:51,169
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been busy organizing our summer programs, and we have a full complement of programs.

848
01:21:52,230 --> 01:22:01,734
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them, as you know, are tuition-based, some of them are supported by grants, and some of them are supported by regular budgets.

849
01:22:01,794 --> 01:22:04,616
[SPEAKER_00]: We thank the school committee for those particular programs.

850
01:22:06,377 --> 01:22:13,040
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, many of the programs are academic, some are recreational, and some are a combination

851
01:22:13,568 --> 01:22:18,989
[SPEAKER_00]: of both, and we're really servicing all grades from pre-K through grade 12.

852
01:22:19,869 --> 01:22:22,250
[SPEAKER_00]: The dates and times of the programs vary.

853
01:22:23,010 --> 01:22:36,913
[SPEAKER_00]: School does end on the 22nd, so most of the programs will start that next Monday, which is June 26th, and just about all of them are ended by the end of August, or the third week in August.

854
01:22:38,328 --> 01:22:50,459
[SPEAKER_00]: We are currently in the process of arranging to staff our programs, identifying students who should attend, and arranging outreach to families on the various programs.

855
01:22:51,260 --> 01:22:53,462
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a summary of each of the programs.

856
01:22:54,023 --> 01:23:00,128
[SPEAKER_00]: The Summer Fund Program is pretty much as it's been in past years to service elementary students.

857
01:23:00,769 --> 01:23:03,751
[SPEAKER_00]: It begins on the 26th, it ends on August 18th.

858
01:23:05,009 --> 01:23:07,350
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's for students in grades K through six.

859
01:23:07,410 --> 01:23:08,090
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a full day.

860
01:23:08,970 --> 01:23:11,551
[SPEAKER_00]: It begins at 7.30 a.m.

861
01:23:11,571 --> 01:23:14,172
[SPEAKER_00]: and ends at 4.30 p.m.

862
01:23:15,892 --> 01:23:24,515
[SPEAKER_00]: Families sign up by the week and the cost is $145 per week and it includes breakfast every day and pizza on Fridays.

863
01:23:26,395 --> 01:23:32,757
[SPEAKER_00]: Regular summer school, this is for students who have failed a subject grade six through 12 who have to make up

864
01:23:33,563 --> 01:23:36,384
[SPEAKER_00]: the subject in order to advance to the next grades.

865
01:23:37,364 --> 01:23:40,765
[SPEAKER_00]: And this year, we're doing things a little differently.

866
01:23:41,165 --> 01:23:51,568
[SPEAKER_00]: The programs all start on June 26 and end on August 8, which is consistent with the 30-day school committee requirement.

867
01:23:52,628 --> 01:23:54,829
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the programs are at Medford High School.

868
01:23:55,569 --> 01:24:00,430
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, student tuition supports the programs.

869
01:24:00,994 --> 01:24:04,236
[SPEAKER_00]: Students pay $250 a course if they're Medford students.

870
01:24:04,717 --> 01:24:11,181
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do have a number of outside students who are paying a little bit more, $300 per course.

871
01:24:11,582 --> 01:24:14,284
[SPEAKER_00]: If you recall, last year we conducted a pilot.

872
01:24:14,804 --> 01:24:20,848
[SPEAKER_00]: And that pilot was to offer online courses for all of the makeup science courses.

873
01:24:21,389 --> 01:24:25,011
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that proved to be very successful for many reasons.

874
01:24:25,492 --> 01:24:26,372
[SPEAKER_00]: It was engaging.

875
01:24:26,493 --> 01:24:28,294
[SPEAKER_00]: Students had kind of a different approach

876
01:24:28,956 --> 01:24:34,219
[SPEAKER_00]: to their learning, which was kind of welcomed after, you know, a year of regular instruction.

877
01:24:34,979 --> 01:24:38,622
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that this did, we were able to offer more science courses.

878
01:24:39,042 --> 01:24:45,125
[SPEAKER_00]: So we actually had students from other communities that didn't have these courses coming to Medford.

879
01:24:45,465 --> 01:24:47,567
[SPEAKER_00]: So that helped to generate a little bit more money.

880
01:24:48,547 --> 01:24:53,290
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other very big plus is that, you know, officially summer school has an ending date.

881
01:24:53,770 --> 01:24:57,012
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are students who sometimes just need a little extra time

882
01:24:57,634 --> 01:25:05,718
[SPEAKER_00]: This provided them with the time because we allowed those students, because they could work at their own pace, to have a few more weeks in August to complete.

883
01:25:06,338 --> 01:25:17,123
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the supervisors of summer school were telling me as we were debriefing, this led to several more students actually making it over the bar because they had the extra time.

884
01:25:17,883 --> 01:25:26,187
[SPEAKER_00]: So given on that experience and given on the fact that the school system has made a commitment to online learning, we've purchased

885
01:25:27,236 --> 01:25:30,017
[SPEAKER_00]: a subscription with Edmentum, which is online courses.

886
01:25:30,237 --> 01:25:34,339
[SPEAKER_00]: And currently we have seniors who are doing credit recovery using this.

887
01:25:34,839 --> 01:25:37,620
[SPEAKER_00]: We have other students who are just taking supplemental courses.

888
01:25:38,460 --> 01:25:41,441
[SPEAKER_00]: And we decided that all of summer school will be online.

889
01:25:42,622 --> 01:25:46,503
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we have, we're gonna have facilitators for each subject area.

890
01:25:47,063 --> 01:25:56,827
[SPEAKER_00]: What they're doing is they're looking at the course that's the package course, and they're making any modifications to make sure it aligns completely with our own courses.

891
01:25:57,492 --> 01:26:02,996
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we will be running our summer school online for those grades.

892
01:26:03,476 --> 01:26:24,029
[SPEAKER_00]: The only exception is grades six and seven because, again, in debriefing about what happened last year, the summer school coordinators, Jill Sawyer and David Blau, said that the sixth and seventh graders taking, you know, all that academic instruction was really very difficult for them and they really needed a different model.

893
01:26:24,843 --> 01:26:38,226
[SPEAKER_00]: So for sixth and seventh graders, they will still be at the high school, but they'll have, be in a kind of a different section of the high school, and they will have regular instruction, because we felt that age group maybe couldn't handle complete online instruction.

894
01:26:38,827 --> 01:26:50,449
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what we plan to do is to have kind of a break in the middle, and offer some kind of an activity that is an enrichment activity, and we're kind of making our decisions now on what that will be.

895
01:26:50,529 --> 01:26:52,770
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we might do a little bit of social emotional,

896
01:26:53,925 --> 01:26:59,889
[SPEAKER_00]: One week we'll actually bring them into the vocational setting and let them know more about vocational education.

897
01:27:00,770 --> 01:27:02,791
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll probably have some recreational things.

898
01:27:02,831 --> 01:27:04,873
[SPEAKER_00]: They can run around and blow off some steam.

899
01:27:05,233 --> 01:27:10,316
[SPEAKER_00]: And that'll be in the middle part because many of these youngsters have to stay for both the English and math.

900
01:27:11,257 --> 01:27:12,118
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's our plan.

901
01:27:12,658 --> 01:27:16,100
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're hoping that, you know, this is a big improvement on what happened last year.

902
01:27:16,721 --> 01:27:20,003
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, that's what we will be doing for regular summer school.

903
01:27:21,084 --> 01:27:31,850
[SPEAKER_00]: Other programs, and we have several other programs, our English Language Learner Summer Program will service newcomers for the most part, elementary, middle, and high school students.

904
01:27:32,590 --> 01:27:34,171
[SPEAKER_00]: This program will be at the McGlynn.

905
01:27:34,811 --> 01:27:39,214
[SPEAKER_00]: We've contained our programs to the high school, the McGlynn, and the Roberts.

906
01:27:39,914 --> 01:27:49,679
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that already I've given John McLaughlin the schedule so he can begin the cleaning, so we're kind of working that so all the buildings, even though they're being used during the summer,

907
01:27:50,043 --> 01:27:53,765
[SPEAKER_00]: will be properly cleaned when students return in August.

908
01:27:54,966 --> 01:27:59,168
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you can see the schedule for those EL programs.

909
01:27:59,448 --> 01:28:08,453
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, they are very helpful for these youngsters who really need to have that continuity of language acquisition throughout the summer months.

910
01:28:10,254 --> 01:28:14,436
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year and this year, we're having our middle school computer science camp.

911
01:28:15,236 --> 01:28:18,158
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really run through the grant that Molly Layden

912
01:28:18,652 --> 01:28:20,293
[SPEAKER_00]: has throughout the school year.

913
01:28:20,353 --> 01:28:31,782
[SPEAKER_00]: It's for one week, and these are middle school students that have been involved in this project, where they're basically learning about apps and actually designing apps.

914
01:28:31,842 --> 01:28:34,564
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very exciting for the students and very engaging.

915
01:28:35,985 --> 01:28:40,608
[SPEAKER_00]: The Medford Vocational Technical School Exploratory Program, again, for middle school students.

916
01:28:40,628 --> 01:28:42,009
[SPEAKER_00]: This was successful last year.

917
01:28:42,470 --> 01:28:46,393
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a two-week program, and students are coming in.

918
01:28:47,373 --> 01:28:59,281
[SPEAKER_00]: learning about vocational education, they'll decide, I'm not quite sure exactly which shops are gonna be open for them to use, but they will actually develop a product to take home with them at the end of the experience.

919
01:28:59,701 --> 01:29:04,825
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another program that's worked out very well, so we wanted to continue that.

920
01:29:06,006 --> 01:29:06,746
[SPEAKER_00]: High School 101.

921
01:29:07,687 --> 01:29:12,270
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this program started when we had our academic support grant.

922
01:29:13,198 --> 01:29:19,883
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was so successful that once the grant dried up, the school committee decided to support it through regular budget.

923
01:29:20,624 --> 01:29:39,238
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been a wonderful program because what we do here is we have our students who are entering grade nine who have been identified as students who maybe need a little bit of an extra push and a little bit of extra help in, you know, getting into grade nine in terms of finishing their summer work.

924
01:29:39,819 --> 01:29:42,481
[SPEAKER_00]: All eighth grade students have English and mathematics summer work.

925
01:29:43,322 --> 01:29:48,707
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have found that, you know, when they get to school, some of them just haven't done this work.

926
01:29:48,747 --> 01:29:53,891
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to make sure that they're there, not, you know, kind of getting off to a bad start.

927
01:29:54,172 --> 01:30:01,518
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we do is we bring them in three days in August, the last week before school begins.

928
01:30:02,319 --> 01:30:09,325
[SPEAKER_00]: They have teachers there who are helping them to finish this work, and they do academic work for three days.

929
01:30:09,889 --> 01:30:15,750
[SPEAKER_00]: They also have a chance to meet many of the high school administrators, because all the administrators are back at this time.

930
01:30:16,331 --> 01:30:17,991
[SPEAKER_00]: And they get tours of the building.

931
01:30:18,451 --> 01:30:23,072
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we finish that program with day four, which is the regular ninth grade orientation.

932
01:30:23,552 --> 01:30:31,194
[SPEAKER_00]: So these students actually have kind of three extra days where they're getting acclimated to the high school, finishing up their summer work.

933
01:30:32,554 --> 01:30:39,276
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we have a very high attendance rate for the kids that are invited to participate.

934
01:30:39,764 --> 01:30:41,565
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is very exciting as well.

935
01:30:42,646 --> 01:30:48,731
[SPEAKER_00]: A full complement of special education programs, some of them will be at the high school, some of them will be at the Roberts.

936
01:30:49,292 --> 01:30:56,478
[SPEAKER_00]: We have all of our nursing staff in place for the students that need any kind of help with health issues.

937
01:30:57,198 --> 01:31:03,403
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, you can see the dates and the special education programs are generally developed from the students IEPs.

938
01:31:03,743 --> 01:31:09,328
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are students who really need summer services to satisfy the requirements of their IEPs.

939
01:31:10,153 --> 01:31:10,973
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's about it.

940
01:31:10,993 --> 01:31:16,755
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of things going on, very busy, and we'll be all set to begin right after school gets out.

941
01:31:17,455 --> 01:31:17,935
[SPEAKER_00]: Questions?

942
01:31:18,495 --> 01:31:18,676
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

943
01:31:18,716 --> 01:31:19,156
[SPEAKER_05]: Cunha.

944
01:31:19,516 --> 01:31:19,956
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

945
01:31:20,496 --> 01:31:20,936
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Ms.

946
01:31:20,956 --> 01:31:22,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Nelson, for the report.

947
01:31:23,077 --> 01:31:24,977
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have a lot going on, I guess, this summer, huh?

948
01:31:26,238 --> 01:31:28,779
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to go over some of the summer school things.

949
01:31:29,219 --> 01:31:32,580
[SPEAKER_05]: It's $250 for a Methods student, $300 for outside students.

950
01:31:32,900 --> 01:31:36,841
[SPEAKER_05]: But is that for all students, even if they're taking the online courses?

951
01:31:37,670 --> 01:31:45,276
[SPEAKER_00]: These are students that have to make up courses and so everybody pays the tuition fee Okay, whether they're taking it online or not.

952
01:31:45,616 --> 01:31:45,957
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.

953
01:31:46,237 --> 01:31:46,497
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

954
01:31:46,957 --> 01:31:54,924
[SPEAKER_05]: The other thing is is that Do we have a breakdown over the years or an idea of how many students for each of these courses?

955
01:31:55,424 --> 01:31:57,166
[SPEAKER_05]: Like how many students do we get back?

956
01:31:58,467 --> 01:32:06,273
[SPEAKER_05]: For let's say high school 101 the students entering grade 9 from from what I understand You don't have to have a particular grade in that it's open to anyone

957
01:32:06,630 --> 01:32:09,431
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's not open to everybody because we couldn't accommodate everybody.

958
01:32:09,491 --> 01:32:26,779
[SPEAKER_00]: What it is, is the teachers are currently, okay, when we had the grant, under the guidelines of the grant, the students that were invited to come to high school 101, we had to look at their MCAS scores, and they had a certain level, relatively, you know, either warning or needs improvement.

959
01:32:27,399 --> 01:32:28,500
[SPEAKER_00]: Those students were invited.

960
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:36,443
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we no longer are under the grant, we don't have the guidelines, so what we are asking teachers to do is for the teachers to identify students

961
01:32:36,988 --> 01:32:39,270
[SPEAKER_00]: that they think need this extra help.

962
01:32:39,870 --> 01:32:47,356
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, students that they've had in class all year who maybe don't finish their homework or maybe haven't gotten, you know, a wonderful grade.

963
01:32:47,416 --> 01:32:53,021
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they're, you know, again, students who just need to have their hands held a little bit and walk through.

964
01:32:53,381 --> 01:32:57,524
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's very, you know, the ninth grade teachers expect the students have this work done.

965
01:32:58,005 --> 01:33:00,747
[SPEAKER_00]: And when the kids arrive day one and all of a sudden,

966
01:33:01,268 --> 01:33:03,870
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't have that work, it's not a great start, okay?

967
01:33:03,890 --> 01:33:05,171
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want them to start behind.

968
01:33:05,812 --> 01:33:19,242
[SPEAKER_00]: So this has been very successful in making sure those students show up day one, having done the work that's expected of them, and again, the eighth grade teachers are identifying who we should invite.

969
01:33:19,703 --> 01:33:28,570
[SPEAKER_00]: We usually have about 40 students in the past, and again, the ones that are invited, for the most part, they come, they come.

970
01:33:29,643 --> 01:33:36,124
[SPEAKER_05]: And you were saying that using the online classes last year, it seemed like it was more successful.

971
01:33:36,424 --> 01:33:37,825
[SPEAKER_05]: How many students did we have?

972
01:33:38,465 --> 01:33:40,125
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd have to get you the exact numbers.

973
01:33:40,265 --> 01:33:43,626
[SPEAKER_00]: Any student that had to take a science makeup class did it online.

974
01:33:43,866 --> 01:33:47,546
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd have to get from David or Jill the exact numbers of those students.

975
01:33:47,586 --> 01:33:53,307
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, things that happen, you know, when you try something out, you expect certain things.

976
01:33:53,327 --> 01:33:55,628
[SPEAKER_00]: But then sometimes there are extra things that are very,

977
01:33:57,058 --> 01:34:23,403
[SPEAKER_00]: good things that happen and I think one of the things that David and Jill were very excited about is that The students who would have had to end in that day in August when the last day of school took place and maybe would have failed Were allowed to continue on on their own and they were successful By having another two weeks where they could just work on this course and that's something we didn't really count on but you know what that's a great thing so summer school doesn't have to officially end when the

978
01:34:23,962 --> 01:34:25,703
[SPEAKER_00]: the teachers walk away from the students.

979
01:34:25,723 --> 01:34:29,665
[SPEAKER_00]: The students can still continue on and can be successful.

980
01:34:30,205 --> 01:34:31,646
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were very happy with that.

981
01:34:31,666 --> 01:34:34,267
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the feedback from the students?

982
01:34:34,507 --> 01:34:37,488
[SPEAKER_00]: From what I hear, they like doing it online.

983
01:34:37,948 --> 01:34:39,869
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't just leave them by themselves in a room.

984
01:34:39,889 --> 01:34:44,111
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's teachers, facilitators there that they can ask questions.

985
01:34:44,211 --> 01:34:49,053
[SPEAKER_00]: We also make sure that somebody in technology is around in case something breaks down.

986
01:34:49,554 --> 01:34:52,395
[SPEAKER_00]: We're hoping to keep the classes because

987
01:34:52,947 --> 01:34:55,269
[SPEAKER_00]: When we had just the science, we put them in the labs.

988
01:34:55,830 --> 01:34:59,814
[SPEAKER_00]: But now that we're going to have all the courses online, we're going to use regular classrooms with Chromebooks.

989
01:35:00,614 --> 01:35:03,677
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we're kind of making sure that everything's going to work.

990
01:35:03,697 --> 01:35:09,263
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working with the technology department to make sure that if we have 100 kids online at one time, it's going to be

991
01:35:10,048 --> 01:35:11,008
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to be successful.

992
01:35:11,128 --> 01:35:13,889
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're trying to flush all that out so there are no problems.

993
01:35:14,489 --> 01:35:20,470
[SPEAKER_05]: And as far as the assignments itself, are they assigned homework at the end of the day on these?

994
01:35:21,251 --> 01:35:25,192
[SPEAKER_00]: From what I understand, they can accelerate at their own pace.

995
01:35:25,292 --> 01:35:31,993
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they have to physically be at the high school to satisfy the requirement of being on site for those hours.

996
01:35:32,673 --> 01:35:35,094
[SPEAKER_00]: But my understanding is pretty much self-paced.

997
01:35:36,289 --> 01:35:43,576
[SPEAKER_00]: Bernadette, you've worked with this too and you can correct me if I'm giving misinformation, but they're pretty much self-paced and they're like in modules.

998
01:35:44,097 --> 01:35:50,784
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually, you know, you and I might be taking the same course sitting side by side, but you could be doing something very different.

999
01:35:50,804 --> 01:35:54,427
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're well ahead of me and I'm just struggling to do something else.

1000
01:35:54,467 --> 01:35:57,150
[SPEAKER_00]: So my understanding is that's how it works.

1001
01:35:57,210 --> 01:35:58,592
[SPEAKER_00]: And Bernadette, if you want to add anything.

1002
01:35:59,958 --> 01:36:06,883
[SPEAKER_16]: I just want to add that a student could log on at home, so if a student wanted to do more work.

1003
01:36:07,643 --> 01:36:13,127
[SPEAKER_16]: But we do need to stay true to the requirement of the number of hours that they need to have in the classroom.

1004
01:36:14,268 --> 01:36:15,289
[SPEAKER_16]: It's what's a balancing act.

1005
01:36:15,329 --> 01:36:19,191
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't want them to go too far ahead and then come to school with nothing to do.

1006
01:36:19,331 --> 01:36:25,296
[SPEAKER_16]: So at least in the beginning, they will be encouraged to do the work within the classroom.

1007
01:36:26,286 --> 01:36:28,768
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, if they need it, certainly, they'll be able to log on at home.

1008
01:36:29,549 --> 01:36:40,698
[SPEAKER_00]: One additional thing, too, about the program, Edmentum, is that there are other things, like Bernadette said, what if we have that student who finishes the second day, I'm done with the course, very unlikely, but who knows.

1009
01:36:41,659 --> 01:36:48,184
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have, there are other courses that are very helpful, like there's a course called study skills.

1010
01:36:48,704 --> 01:36:52,708
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of these students could benefit from taking an online course on study skills.

1011
01:36:52,728 --> 01:36:54,269
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we see that happening,

1012
01:36:55,121 --> 01:37:03,924
[SPEAKER_00]: we can intervene with some other products, some other programs within this material that we've purchased that can be useful to these kids too.

1013
01:37:04,264 --> 01:37:06,025
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we just don't want them sitting there, obviously.

1014
01:37:06,665 --> 01:37:06,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

1015
01:37:07,065 --> 01:37:16,789
[SPEAKER_05]: And my other concern is I don't want children who don't have the accessibility of having laptops and computers at home even feeling worse.

1016
01:37:16,869 --> 01:37:19,750
[SPEAKER_05]: Because now if other people do have that accessibility,

1017
01:37:20,262 --> 01:37:24,885
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just don't want them coming to school and feeling like they're feeling because now they're falling behind.

1018
01:37:25,346 --> 01:37:37,455
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess my question is, too, is after a certain hour that they're done, if students want to stay and go to the library and work a little bit extra because they don't have laptops or anything, do they have that accessibility?

1019
01:37:37,915 --> 01:37:38,675
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, no.

1020
01:37:39,156 --> 01:37:41,437
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd have to obviously look into that.

1021
01:37:41,477 --> 01:37:44,680
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a suggestion I can make to David and Jill.

1022
01:37:44,720 --> 01:37:47,662
[SPEAKER_00]: If they can get staff to stay a little bit extra, that would be great.

1023
01:37:48,902 --> 01:37:59,869
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we will monitor, you know, what kids are doing in terms of, the expectation is that they're doing this work in the hours that they're supposed to be in summer school.

1024
01:38:00,289 --> 01:38:03,091
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are always kids who just feel, you know, we like that.

1025
01:38:03,111 --> 01:38:06,112
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to stop somebody from going home and pursuing something.

1026
01:38:06,432 --> 01:38:08,234
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't want to discourage that.

1027
01:38:08,334 --> 01:38:14,937
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll try to find a way to work around it, maybe offer an extra hour in the library that they can come to.

1028
01:38:14,977 --> 01:38:15,938
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll speak to David about that.

1029
01:38:16,300 --> 01:38:16,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1030
01:38:16,700 --> 01:38:23,444
[SPEAKER_05]: And you, my last question was that you have, um, you have introductory physics, chemistry and biology online.

1031
01:38:23,604 --> 01:38:25,785
[SPEAKER_05]: Are those the same courses that are going to be provided this year?

1032
01:38:25,805 --> 01:38:27,086
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you going to add more?

1033
01:38:27,306 --> 01:38:31,669
[SPEAKER_00]: I think those are the three that were identified by Mrs. Ceri is what the kids needed to make up.

1034
01:38:32,869 --> 01:38:33,149
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1035
01:38:33,230 --> 01:38:35,051
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much.

1036
01:38:36,171 --> 01:38:39,213
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just wondering about the English language learner summer program.

1037
01:38:39,712 --> 01:38:47,061
[SPEAKER_03]: So out of the newcomers at the Roberts and the newcomers at middle school and the newcomers at the high school, what percent would you say take advantage of it?

1038
01:38:47,081 --> 01:38:48,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I think it's a great program.

1039
01:38:49,875 --> 01:38:53,696
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd have to check with Mrs. Trotter on that.

1040
01:38:54,316 --> 01:38:57,436
[SPEAKER_00]: It is free, so free always encourages people to come.

1041
01:38:57,456 --> 01:38:59,737
[SPEAKER_03]: In lunch and transportation, I would think you could get 100%.

1042
01:38:59,777 --> 01:39:00,977
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because she has the grant.

1043
01:39:01,017 --> 01:39:02,417
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a Title III grant.

1044
01:39:02,797 --> 01:39:12,259
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's unfortunate that some of the programs, we can offer transportation, some we can offer food, but it really is dependent upon if we have grant funding for that.

1045
01:39:12,399 --> 01:39:16,400
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can check with her to see how many kids actually

1046
01:39:17,343 --> 01:39:18,543
[SPEAKER_00]: come who are invited.

1047
01:39:18,783 --> 01:39:18,983
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

1048
01:39:19,023 --> 01:39:19,103
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1049
01:39:19,143 --> 01:39:19,784
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be great.

1050
01:39:19,984 --> 01:39:21,804
[SPEAKER_00]: Those students are pretty motivated though.

1051
01:39:21,844 --> 01:39:25,225
[SPEAKER_00]: They, they tend to, to go to most things they're invited to.

1052
01:39:25,245 --> 01:39:26,245
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1053
01:39:26,585 --> 01:39:33,167
[SPEAKER_03]: And then on the special ed program, the last part is there's approximately 142 students requiring the various services.

1054
01:39:33,607 --> 01:39:38,028
[SPEAKER_03]: Do all 142 take advantage of this, these programs?

1055
01:39:38,828 --> 01:39:43,089
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, again, this is part of what they're supposed to be doing on their IEPs.

1056
01:39:43,209 --> 01:39:46,210
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe they get a pretty good attendance rate on that because

1057
01:39:46,845 --> 01:39:49,827
[SPEAKER_00]: The parents want the kids to have the services during the summer.

1058
01:39:50,267 --> 01:40:03,495
[SPEAKER_03]: So can I make a motion to see if Kathy could tell us what percent comes and if Trotter could tell us what percent comes to the, just maybe we, if they're not a hundred percent, maybe there's a way to outreach more to get more people to them.

1059
01:40:04,916 --> 01:40:06,577
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will get the data on that.

1060
01:40:07,497 --> 01:40:08,278
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

1061
01:40:09,363 --> 01:40:09,543
[SPEAKER_07]: Ms.

1062
01:40:09,583 --> 01:40:10,123
[SPEAKER_07]: Van de Kloof.

1063
01:40:11,724 --> 01:40:16,925
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to ask about the summer school program in terms of tuition.

1064
01:40:18,045 --> 01:40:25,027
[SPEAKER_02]: For students who are on free or reduced lunch, you know, potentially if they fail two subjects, it's $500.

1065
01:40:25,707 --> 01:40:33,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have a reduced cost for students who are clearly economically disadvantaged?

1066
01:40:34,709 --> 01:40:38,390
[SPEAKER_00]: We work with families who have special circumstances.

1067
01:40:38,470 --> 01:40:38,990
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that

1068
01:40:39,965 --> 01:40:52,411
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's a payment plan, so they don't have to do all of the tuition up front, and I know there are times that we're very forgiving if the circumstances are such, but we take it on an individual case.

1069
01:40:52,451 --> 01:41:01,755
[SPEAKER_00]: To say that everyone gets free and reduced lunch, gets reduction in tuition is not what we're currently doing, but we do obviously take that into consideration.

1070
01:41:01,775 --> 01:41:04,696
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, as long as I know that there's... We don't turn people away who need it.

1071
01:41:05,076 --> 01:41:06,117
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, thank you.

1072
01:41:06,997 --> 01:41:07,837
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Benedetto.

1073
01:41:08,278 --> 01:41:08,638
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1074
01:41:09,461 --> 01:41:16,283
[SPEAKER_06]: My question is actually directed towards the Mayor in regard to the summer recreation book.

1075
01:41:16,923 --> 01:41:18,983
[SPEAKER_08]: It went to print today.

1076
01:41:19,003 --> 01:41:29,466
[SPEAKER_08]: So our summer recreation has a litany of programming, sports camps, some of the programs that you have, we have similar camps that are going to be had, and music camps.

1077
01:41:29,901 --> 01:41:33,923
[SPEAKER_08]: There's quite a bit that's going to be in the catalog, and it went to print today, so we're hoping to have it next week.

1078
01:41:34,183 --> 01:41:35,924
[SPEAKER_06]: And where will they be available?

1079
01:41:35,944 --> 01:41:40,065
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be distributing through the schools, we'll be doing backpacks, and it'll also be online.

1080
01:41:40,846 --> 01:41:43,907
[SPEAKER_06]: Will there be any up at the library, just in case people are there?

1081
01:41:43,927 --> 01:41:44,747
[SPEAKER_06]: We always put them there.

1082
01:41:45,207 --> 01:41:46,048
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, great.

1083
01:41:46,208 --> 01:41:46,528
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1084
01:41:47,538 --> 01:41:47,938
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, Ms.

1085
01:41:47,978 --> 01:41:48,458
[SPEAKER_07]: Van de Kloet.

1086
01:41:48,478 --> 01:41:49,519
[SPEAKER_07]: Just one last thing.

1087
01:41:49,539 --> 01:41:57,063
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we discuss the summer fund program, I think I ought to give kudos to Ann Marie Cuno, our colleague who really got it off the ground.

1088
01:41:57,743 --> 01:41:58,983
[SPEAKER_02]: So just want to mention that.

1089
01:41:59,604 --> 01:41:59,964
[SPEAKER_15]: Very good.

1090
01:42:03,185 --> 01:42:03,406
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

1091
01:42:03,446 --> 01:42:03,686
[SPEAKER_15]: Krebs.

1092
01:42:03,706 --> 01:42:04,066
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1093
01:42:04,106 --> 01:42:04,906
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for the report.

1094
01:42:05,427 --> 01:42:11,629
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanted to mention we were at the West Memphis Community Center the other day, and they're having a summer camp as well.

1095
01:42:12,130 --> 01:42:14,031
[SPEAKER_15]: It's 10 weeks, June 26 to September 1st, 8 a.m.

1096
01:42:14,051 --> 01:42:14,191
[SPEAKER_15]: to 6 p.m.

1097
01:42:17,723 --> 01:42:24,145
[SPEAKER_15]: middle school six to eight and it's 175 a week and you only pay for the weeks you need.

1098
01:42:24,565 --> 01:42:25,646
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just wanted to mention it.

1099
01:42:25,726 --> 01:42:29,827
[SPEAKER_15]: And if anybody's interested, there's still spaces limited, but there's still space available.

1100
01:42:30,347 --> 01:42:30,728
[SPEAKER_07]: Very good.

1101
01:42:30,748 --> 01:42:31,188
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1102
01:42:31,348 --> 01:42:31,508
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1103
01:42:31,568 --> 01:42:31,968
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1104
01:42:36,358 --> 01:42:36,738
[SPEAKER_08]: Very good.

1105
01:42:36,778 --> 01:42:39,218
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a motion on the floor to receive in place on file?

1106
01:42:40,179 --> 01:42:40,319
[SPEAKER_08]: Ms.

1107
01:42:40,339 --> 01:42:41,359
[SPEAKER_08]: Van de Kloot has a question.

1108
01:42:41,559 --> 01:42:48,380
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I just noticed that in our, uh, the form, it says that the, uh, summer fund program runs 7 30 PM to 4 30 PM.

1109
01:42:48,740 --> 01:42:49,920
[SPEAKER_02]: It just needs to be corrected.

1110
01:42:50,700 --> 01:42:52,001
[SPEAKER_08]: Just in the report.

1111
01:42:52,501 --> 01:42:54,721
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks.

1112
01:42:56,581 --> 01:42:58,202
[SPEAKER_08]: Very good.

1113
01:42:58,282 --> 01:42:58,762
[SPEAKER_08]: Backwards.

1114
01:42:58,902 --> 01:42:59,642
[SPEAKER_08]: Back to the future.

1115
01:42:59,662 --> 01:43:01,842
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a motion for approval offered by Ms.

1116
01:43:01,882 --> 01:43:03,042
[SPEAKER_08]: Van de Kloot, seconded by Ms.

1117
01:43:03,062 --> 01:43:03,403
[SPEAKER_08]: Cuno.

1118
01:43:03,443 --> 01:43:04,223
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor.

1119
01:43:05,203 --> 01:43:05,963
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed.

1120
01:43:06,865 --> 01:43:08,526
[SPEAKER_08]: papers received and placed on file.

1121
01:43:09,327 --> 01:43:15,331
[SPEAKER_08]: And our final report on English language learners, newcomers program redistribution, Mr. Superintendent.

1122
01:43:16,072 --> 01:43:24,338
[SPEAKER_11]: So one of the discussions we've had recently is the concentration of students who are ELL in any one elementary school.

1123
01:43:25,359 --> 01:43:32,264
[SPEAKER_11]: And the newcomers program has historically been at the Roberts, but the numbers have become very substantial.

1124
01:43:32,924 --> 01:43:35,406
[SPEAKER_11]: And one of the discussions that we had was how can we,

1125
01:43:36,712 --> 01:43:38,854
[SPEAKER_11]: spread them out, redistribute them a little bit more.

1126
01:43:38,914 --> 01:43:47,640
[SPEAKER_11]: In earlier discussions, we talked about splitting, let's say, grades one and two at one school, and three, four, and five at another.

1127
01:43:48,260 --> 01:43:58,808
[SPEAKER_11]: And so this particular report tells you that next year it's our plan to send grades one and two to the Brooks School for two reasons.

1128
01:43:58,948 --> 01:44:03,911
[SPEAKER_11]: One, it will redistribute the newcomers program, not all ELL students, but the newcomers program.

1129
01:44:04,752 --> 01:44:06,253
[SPEAKER_11]: And also, it will create more

1130
01:44:06,780 --> 01:44:12,762
[SPEAKER_11]: of a balance between the two schools, because the population at the Brooks is lower than the population at the Roberts.

1131
01:44:13,242 --> 01:44:22,105
[SPEAKER_11]: Put the two together, they'll come up with a similar population, and the diversity level at the Brooks will increase substantially, and that will be helpful as well.

1132
01:44:22,705 --> 01:44:27,607
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's our goal, that's what we're doing, and we plan to move ahead unless there's an objection.

1133
01:44:30,342 --> 01:44:31,422
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have any questions, miss?

1134
01:44:31,502 --> 01:44:31,702
[SPEAKER_08]: No?

1135
01:44:32,322 --> 01:44:32,643
[SPEAKER_08]: You're good?

1136
01:44:33,683 --> 01:44:34,163
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good.

1137
01:44:35,023 --> 01:44:35,823
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Benedetto.

1138
01:44:36,463 --> 01:44:41,204
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this is a great idea, Mr. Superintendent.

1139
01:44:43,825 --> 01:44:54,087
[SPEAKER_06]: There has been significant parent presence at some of our meetings worried about the class size and where space was available at our schools.

1140
01:44:54,547 --> 01:44:57,228
[SPEAKER_06]: And I really believe that this is a really

1141
01:44:57,669 --> 01:44:59,089
[SPEAKER_06]: good way to look at this.

1142
01:44:59,149 --> 01:45:03,470
[SPEAKER_06]: And we can watch it closely next year and make any other adjustments.

1143
01:45:03,910 --> 01:45:18,633
[SPEAKER_06]: All that I ask is if there does cause hardships to individual families, that you take that into account and work with those families and make sure that the transition works well for those families.

1144
01:45:18,773 --> 01:45:27,134
[SPEAKER_06]: And if there's great hardship of separating siblings, you keep that in mind when placement is necessary.

1145
01:45:28,378 --> 01:45:31,720
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's very important for us to maybe make a statement at this point in time.

1146
01:45:32,661 --> 01:45:34,342
[SPEAKER_11]: We talked about this the other night at the middle schools.

1147
01:45:36,743 --> 01:45:38,704
[SPEAKER_11]: We can't make everybody happy all the time.

1148
01:45:39,385 --> 01:45:45,509
[SPEAKER_11]: There's going to be decisions that are going to be made that are going to require people to accept certain kinds of things for distribution purposes.

1149
01:45:46,149 --> 01:45:47,850
[SPEAKER_11]: Now this year we'll do it with the elementary.

1150
01:45:48,322 --> 01:45:53,845
[SPEAKER_11]: But as we go into next year, we're going to have to take a very strong look at the middle school and redistribute students.

1151
01:45:54,445 --> 01:45:59,547
[SPEAKER_11]: Because otherwise, one school will be very heavy with certain types of students who require certain services.

1152
01:45:59,987 --> 01:46:05,510
[SPEAKER_11]: Other schools will be less populated and have other challenges.

1153
01:46:05,950 --> 01:46:08,551
[SPEAKER_11]: So people ask for certain things.

1154
01:46:08,631 --> 01:46:10,132
[SPEAKER_11]: We do our best to accommodate them.

1155
01:46:10,552 --> 01:46:12,514
[SPEAKER_11]: From time to time, we have to make a decision.

1156
01:46:13,194 --> 01:46:15,416
[SPEAKER_11]: And not everybody's going to be happy with that decision.

1157
01:46:15,456 --> 01:46:18,619
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's the nature of trying to be fair to everybody.

1158
01:46:20,020 --> 01:46:27,326
[SPEAKER_11]: And sometimes in transition, there are a few people that feel like we didn't consider their particular situation.

1159
01:46:27,366 --> 01:46:29,588
[SPEAKER_11]: But we'll try to consider as many situations as we can.

1160
01:46:33,940 --> 01:46:44,813
[SPEAKER_02]: I think my biggest concern is sometimes older students are in charge of looking after younger siblings and by splitting the families between two schools, which I certainly understand why we're

1161
01:46:45,595 --> 01:46:50,218
[SPEAKER_02]: moving in that direction, that could create some issues.

1162
01:46:50,658 --> 01:46:53,380
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the place that I'm most concerned about.

1163
01:46:54,621 --> 01:47:03,746
[SPEAKER_02]: And there may be some interesting and creative solutions to that for families, but I think that we just need to be very, very well aware of.

1164
01:47:04,366 --> 01:47:11,731
[SPEAKER_02]: And most importantly is the information to the families, so we're aware of any, you know, real problems ahead of time.

1165
01:47:12,408 --> 01:47:22,512
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the things we'll do after tonight is we'll actually reach out to the families that will be affected by school transitions this week and start to let them know that what our plans are.

1166
01:47:23,112 --> 01:47:25,893
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we do have after school programs and other things like that we can.

1167
01:47:27,202 --> 01:47:31,604
[SPEAKER_11]: work out some arrangements for people who have particular needs that really are under stress.

1168
01:47:31,644 --> 01:47:37,807
[SPEAKER_11]: But we've got to be very careful that we don't just assume that everybody is going to get everything that they want.

1169
01:47:37,867 --> 01:47:43,370
[SPEAKER_11]: Because if we do that, we give ourselves an unbearable goal, an unattainable goal.

1170
01:47:43,910 --> 01:47:46,332
[SPEAKER_11]: So from time to time, you make a decision.

1171
01:47:46,812 --> 01:47:48,913
[SPEAKER_11]: You do it in the vast majority of people involved.

1172
01:47:48,953 --> 01:47:53,215
[SPEAKER_11]: And you try to work on the edges with the people that may be affected adversely.

1173
01:47:53,990 --> 01:47:58,351
[SPEAKER_08]: Could you address what happens in third grade when they've finished, let's say a second grade newcomer?

1174
01:47:58,451 --> 01:48:00,652
[SPEAKER_11]: Hopefully by third grade, they're no longer a newcomer.

1175
01:48:00,892 --> 01:48:01,192
[SPEAKER_08]: Correct.

1176
01:48:01,352 --> 01:48:05,073
[SPEAKER_11]: So they can go back to their school of origin or their geographical school.

1177
01:48:05,133 --> 01:48:06,813
[SPEAKER_08]: And they'll have a preference in that transfer?

1178
01:48:06,853 --> 01:48:07,073
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

1179
01:48:07,613 --> 01:48:09,254
[SPEAKER_11]: They would go back to their school of origin.

1180
01:48:09,294 --> 01:48:12,654
[SPEAKER_11]: So the goal is to get them out of the newcomers program as soon as possible.

1181
01:48:12,674 --> 01:48:13,615
[SPEAKER_11]: A couple of years should do it.

1182
01:48:14,815 --> 01:48:17,936
[SPEAKER_11]: And that would hope that they wouldn't have to go to the Roberts.

1183
01:48:17,956 --> 01:48:19,216
[SPEAKER_11]: They could go back to school of origin.

1184
01:48:23,254 --> 01:48:23,574
[SPEAKER_08]: What's that?

1185
01:48:23,895 --> 01:48:25,516
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's Cuneo?

1186
01:48:26,157 --> 01:48:26,917
[SPEAKER_08]: That was my question.

1187
01:48:28,779 --> 01:48:29,139
[SPEAKER_08]: Alrighty.

1188
01:48:29,159 --> 01:48:31,481
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a motion to receive in place on file?

1189
01:48:31,501 --> 01:48:32,642
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Scary made the motion.

1190
01:48:32,682 --> 01:48:34,504
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a second by Miss Van de Kloot?

1191
01:48:34,584 --> 01:48:35,345
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

1192
01:48:35,965 --> 01:48:36,646
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

1193
01:48:36,706 --> 01:48:37,467
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion passes.

1194
01:48:37,487 --> 01:48:38,968
[SPEAKER_11]: We are just a couple of announcements.

1195
01:48:38,988 --> 01:48:40,970
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm taking those no negotiating legal matters.

1196
01:48:41,170 --> 01:48:42,731
[SPEAKER_08]: We have one item of new business.

1197
01:48:43,112 --> 01:48:47,876
[SPEAKER_08]: Be it resolved that the Medford school committee that expressed its sincere condolences to the family of Reverend Edward Dowdy.

1198
01:48:48,283 --> 01:48:50,624
[SPEAKER_08]: Father Ed was the pastor of the Collaboration of St.

1199
01:48:50,644 --> 01:48:51,504
[SPEAKER_08]: Francis and St.

1200
01:48:51,544 --> 01:48:52,965
[SPEAKER_08]: Joseph Churches in Medford.

1201
01:48:52,985 --> 01:48:57,887
[SPEAKER_08]: If you could all please rise for a moment of silence on the passing of Reverend Father Dowdy.

1202
01:49:07,931 --> 01:49:09,712
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Superintendent, a couple of announcements.

1203
01:49:09,752 --> 01:49:14,954
[SPEAKER_11]: So on Wednesday evening last, you asked me for some dates, and I gave you the wrong dates a couple of days later.

1204
01:49:14,974 --> 01:49:15,774
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, graduation.

1205
01:49:18,408 --> 01:49:23,671
[SPEAKER_11]: And what I wanted to see was just how attentive you are to what I send out.

1206
01:49:24,151 --> 01:49:26,733
[SPEAKER_11]: And Kathy was the only one who picked it up, so sorry about that.

1207
01:49:27,193 --> 01:49:28,554
[SPEAKER_11]: The rest of you just weren't paying attention.

1208
01:49:28,734 --> 01:49:30,115
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'm just kidding.

1209
01:49:30,195 --> 01:49:32,836
[SPEAKER_11]: So I've given you corrected dates.

1210
01:49:33,096 --> 01:49:37,599
[SPEAKER_11]: June 6 is the Curtis Tufts graduation, 11.30 at the Irish American.

1211
01:49:39,060 --> 01:49:39,780
[SPEAKER_11]: Now 11 o'clock?

1212
01:49:39,900 --> 01:49:40,200
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

1213
01:49:41,941 --> 01:49:42,301
[SPEAKER_08]: This says 11.30.

1214
01:49:45,162 --> 01:49:47,144
[SPEAKER_11]: It's now 11 o'clock.

1215
01:49:47,165 --> 01:49:49,648
[SPEAKER_08]: 11 o'clock, okay.

1216
01:49:50,929 --> 01:49:51,730
[SPEAKER_11]: 11 o'clock.

1217
01:49:51,750 --> 01:49:54,654
[SPEAKER_11]: If you get there half an hour later you'll be there in time for the food.

1218
01:49:56,656 --> 01:50:01,723
[SPEAKER_11]: The M-Corp banquet is on June 6th in the evening and graduation is on the 7th.

1219
01:50:03,775 --> 01:50:08,196
[SPEAKER_11]: A couple of other things, we have a meeting this Wednesday evening to interview ELL candidates.

1220
01:50:09,356 --> 01:50:14,137
[SPEAKER_11]: I have at least three candidates, good candidates for you to see, possibly a fourth by tomorrow.

1221
01:50:14,497 --> 01:50:16,997
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll make sure we check out a couple of references.

1222
01:50:17,858 --> 01:50:20,558
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's Wednesday starting at seven.

1223
01:50:21,538 --> 01:50:30,480
[SPEAKER_11]: We've reserved the 22nd and the 25th for additional meetings, possibly for community schools or for other situations and also possibly

1224
01:50:31,122 --> 01:50:34,583
[SPEAKER_11]: to interview the candidates for the vocational director's principal's job.

1225
01:50:35,363 --> 01:50:38,023
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm still going through applications, talking to references.

1226
01:50:38,043 --> 01:50:50,326
[SPEAKER_11]: There's some things happening out there in that type of community, the vocational director's community, that may portend for us to postpone that and move it a little bit further out to get all the candidates that I want to have in the pool.

1227
01:50:50,786 --> 01:50:51,466
[SPEAKER_11]: But we'll see that.

1228
01:50:51,506 --> 01:50:53,007
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll know that better in the next week or so.

1229
01:50:56,287 --> 01:50:58,428
[SPEAKER_11]: In addition to that, I think that

1230
01:50:59,682 --> 01:51:04,043
[SPEAKER_11]: You should know that the Senate is coming out with its ways and means budget tomorrow.

1231
01:51:04,403 --> 01:51:13,285
[SPEAKER_11]: That gives us a better idea of what the Senate is proposing versus what the house is proposing and what we might be looking at for state funding and budgets.

1232
01:51:13,325 --> 01:51:19,926
[SPEAKER_11]: We're still looking at federal dollars as they get sifted around, uh, when reports from the federal government.

1233
01:51:19,946 --> 01:51:24,067
[SPEAKER_11]: So all those things have an impact on you and I just want to make sure you're aware of it.

1234
01:51:24,087 --> 01:51:26,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr Benedetto, thank you for those updates.

1235
01:51:26,327 --> 01:51:28,748
[SPEAKER_06]: Superintendent Felson, um, through, um,

1236
01:51:29,479 --> 01:51:31,720
[SPEAKER_06]: May, Madam Mayber.

1237
01:51:31,780 --> 01:51:33,221
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't say that word.

1238
01:51:33,321 --> 01:51:35,463
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, I'm picking up your habit.

1239
01:51:37,764 --> 01:51:45,589
[SPEAKER_06]: So we haven't discussed, as the chairperson of the school committee, we haven't discussed the superintendent's review, his annual review.

1240
01:51:45,989 --> 01:51:53,634
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm requesting that you start that process with, through you for the superintendent's annual review.

1241
01:51:54,735 --> 01:51:56,756
[SPEAKER_06]: So we can have that before the end of

1242
01:51:57,697 --> 01:51:59,458
[SPEAKER_06]: our session before summer break.

1243
01:52:00,399 --> 01:52:07,845
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would like to move forward on making sure that we do our due diligence as a committee and do his annual review.

1244
01:52:08,265 --> 01:52:08,685
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1245
01:52:09,766 --> 01:52:09,966
[SPEAKER_07]: Ms.

1246
01:52:09,986 --> 01:52:11,467
[SPEAKER_07]: Cunha, did you have a comment?

1247
01:52:11,727 --> 01:52:11,827
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1248
01:52:11,847 --> 01:52:16,551
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to know if we have any dates of the budget itself.

1249
01:52:16,971 --> 01:52:17,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Not yet.

1250
01:52:17,352 --> 01:52:21,455
[SPEAKER_08]: All righty.

1251
01:52:22,095 --> 01:52:23,016
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to adjourn.
