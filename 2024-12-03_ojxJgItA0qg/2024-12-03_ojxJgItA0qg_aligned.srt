1
00:01:15,529 --> 00:01:26,455
My buddy Dylan Zahn uses similar bags for his congas.

2
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:51,687
It's an old school technique of Army, Navy duffel bags.

3
00:01:51,907 --> 00:01:57,051
It's a lot cheaper than proper cases.

4
00:01:57,071 --> 00:01:58,192
Proper cases.

5
00:01:59,133 --> 00:02:00,374
Hey, why don't you make it hot?

6
00:02:00,414 --> 00:02:01,755
Give me the case there.

7
00:02:01,815 --> 00:02:03,656
I'll take it to the gear dump.

8
00:02:03,736 --> 00:02:04,177
Oh, I got it.

9
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:13,673
If you don't get done and we're ready to start, will there be time for us to make adjustments moving forward?

10
00:03:13,713 --> 00:03:16,277
Yes, definitely.

11
00:03:16,477 --> 00:03:22,826
I don't like to call it intermission because it puts the wrong idea in people's heads, but we do a little break.

12
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:43,931
He broadcasts on local television.

13
00:03:43,971 --> 00:03:44,252
Wow, okay.

14
00:03:44,312 --> 00:03:45,152
Yeah, that's why.

15
00:03:45,572 --> 00:03:50,174
In the back there with the cameras and so forth.

16
00:03:50,194 --> 00:03:51,074
No, he does it all.

17
00:03:51,354 --> 00:03:55,676
Yeah, well that's his side of the network.

18
00:03:55,796 --> 00:03:59,938
No, it's the guy that volunteers at the station.

19
00:04:36,669 --> 00:04:38,390
That's right.

20
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,290
I like it.

21
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,230
I love it.

22
00:04:40,411 --> 00:04:42,531
I'm editing it right now.

23
00:04:42,571 --> 00:04:44,012
What's going on?

24
00:04:44,192 --> 00:04:45,312
I'm coming to set this.

25
00:04:45,572 --> 00:04:45,892
Oh, OK.

26
00:04:45,932 --> 00:04:47,793
Are you a musician?

27
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:49,473
Yeah, I'm a guitarist.

28
00:04:49,933 --> 00:04:50,414
That's great.

29
00:05:02,452 --> 00:05:05,776
Drums, and Hillary, and saxophone, and polka.

30
00:05:05,796 --> 00:05:08,319
So Owen is the box.

31
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,923
Hillary means a big box.
