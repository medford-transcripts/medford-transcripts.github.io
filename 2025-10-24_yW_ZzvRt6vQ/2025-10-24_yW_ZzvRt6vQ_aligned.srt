00:00:24,196 --> 00:00:30,541
Hello, everyone, and welcome to Medford Happenings, a show foreign about the city of Medford.

2
00:00:31,542 --> 00:00:42,670
I am John Petrella, and the purpose of this program is to give Medford citizens facts and information to help you make informed choices.

3
00:00:43,411 --> 00:00:46,293
And today, we want to welcome our guest,

4
00:00:47,543 --> 00:00:54,070
Mr. Doug Shoup, who is a three-time president of the Meffitt Rotary Club.

5
00:00:54,671 --> 00:00:56,753
Doug, welcome to Meffitt Happenings.

6
00:00:57,133 --> 00:00:57,874
Thanks for having me.

7
00:00:57,894 --> 00:00:59,315
It's our pleasure.

8
00:01:00,116 --> 00:01:05,682
All right, so let's begin by telling our audience a little bit about yourself.

9
00:01:05,742 --> 00:01:06,483
Who's Doug Shoup?

10
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:12,446
OK, well, I'm originally from Ohio.

11
00:01:13,707 --> 00:01:19,973
And I came out here after I graduated architecture school at Cincinnati in 1985.

12
00:01:20,073 --> 00:01:22,755
So I've been here more than half my life.

13
00:01:22,955 --> 00:01:24,176
So this is my home.

14
00:01:24,196 --> 00:01:30,061
I still have relatives there, friends, and I do visit occasionally.

15
00:01:31,703 --> 00:01:33,344
I made a life for myself out here.

16
00:01:33,364 --> 00:01:42,392
I ended up about 31 years ago, opened my own architecture practice in Medford Square, and I've been there ever since.

17
00:01:42,532 --> 00:01:45,395
I'm right across the street from Colleen's, which was

18
00:01:46,115 --> 00:01:47,876
one of my first projects that I had.

19
00:01:47,896 --> 00:01:48,936
Oh, really?

20
00:01:48,956 --> 00:01:49,536
Colleen's?

21
00:01:49,716 --> 00:01:50,596
I had no idea.

22
00:01:50,696 --> 00:01:54,458
Back when Colleen was alive, I did that for her.

23
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:56,678
I'd go in and I'd say, hey, you need this redone.

24
00:01:56,758 --> 00:01:59,399
And eventually, I did it.

25
00:01:59,499 --> 00:02:01,060
And that was one of the first jobs I did.

26
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:01,720
Nice.

27
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:07,565
But and I got I immediately got involved in the Chamber of Commerce.

28
00:02:07,865 --> 00:02:08,125
Right.

29
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:13,389
And they quickly elevated me to president for two years at the chamber.

30
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:15,371
It's yeah.

31
00:02:15,411 --> 00:02:16,472
They're all thankless jobs.

32
00:02:16,512 --> 00:02:16,712
Right.

33
00:02:16,752 --> 00:02:16,972
Yeah.

34
00:02:17,033 --> 00:02:17,933
No, we know that.

35
00:02:17,973 --> 00:02:18,093
Yeah.

36
00:02:18,834 --> 00:02:23,359
But so I did that, and I met a lot of really nice people there.

37
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:30,567
And then I met a guy, Richard Wolfson, and he says, hey, I need to get you into Rotary.

38
00:02:30,647 --> 00:02:32,830
Like, I could tell you're going to do stuff, right?

39
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:35,212
So he got me into Rotary.

40
00:02:35,293 --> 00:02:39,397
And shortly, maybe three years into Rotary, they asked me to be president.

41
00:02:40,298 --> 00:02:46,724
you know, a few times, a few years past, and it's hard to find people to volunteer, you know, a lot more time.

42
00:02:47,164 --> 00:02:50,928
But, you know, it's a very rewarding, it's a very rewarding thing.

43
00:02:50,968 --> 00:02:54,892
And I've always felt, and I was raised, you know, I'm a Midwesterner, so I was raised

44
00:02:55,432 --> 00:02:57,334
You know, you give back to the community you live in.

45
00:02:57,575 --> 00:02:58,295
Absolutely.

46
00:02:58,375 --> 00:02:59,176
That's a great thing.

47
00:02:59,257 --> 00:02:59,557
Yeah.

48
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:02,200
And, you know, it's a lot of time and effort.

49
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,863
But, you know, for me, it makes me feel good.

50
00:03:05,424 --> 00:03:06,224
It's worthwhile.

51
00:03:06,264 --> 00:03:08,747
And you know, you're helping people that a lot of people really need it.

52
00:03:08,867 --> 00:03:09,108
Yep.

53
00:03:09,328 --> 00:03:09,548
Yep.

54
00:03:09,688 --> 00:03:09,929
So.

55
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:16,253
So I got in Rotary and, you know, bring me up to today.

56
00:03:16,354 --> 00:03:21,817
I've just been doing my little architecture thing in the square and back down to just myself.

57
00:03:21,917 --> 00:03:23,358
I had five people at one time.

58
00:03:23,438 --> 00:03:23,699
Right.

59
00:03:24,279 --> 00:03:26,641
And really busy this year.

60
00:03:26,701 --> 00:03:29,322
So all of that's good, you know.

61
00:03:29,623 --> 00:03:30,643
Sounds good.

62
00:03:30,683 --> 00:03:31,524
Living a happy life.

63
00:03:31,624 --> 00:03:32,705
That's all that matters.

64
00:03:32,725 --> 00:03:33,745
That's all that matters.

65
00:03:34,286 --> 00:03:34,646
All right.

66
00:03:35,126 --> 00:03:36,547
So there's a lot of people.

67
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:45,055
I mean, I know a little bit about the Rotary, but there's a lot of people don't, you know, really know much about the Rotary.

68
00:03:45,075 --> 00:03:48,458
Can you tell us, you know, what it is, what you do?

69
00:03:49,038 --> 00:03:49,559
Absolutely.

70
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:55,043
So the Rotary Club, Rotary International, it's an international organization.

71
00:03:56,224 --> 00:04:00,885
was founded 110 years ago by a man named Paul Harris.

72
00:04:01,826 --> 00:04:04,746
And he really started in Chicago.

73
00:04:05,046 --> 00:04:11,048
He started with, I don't know, four or five of his business friends, and they would get together and meet at each of their offices.

74
00:04:11,088 --> 00:04:18,390
They'd rotate every month, and they were trying to come up with the name of it, and they called it The Rotary because they rotated.

75
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:31,870
And they were trying to raise money locally to help people that struggling businesses and struggling families out in a beneficial way, a benevolent way in Chicago.

76
00:04:32,732 --> 00:04:36,834
And now there's an award, a prestigious award, as a Rotarian you can get.

77
00:04:36,874 --> 00:04:38,735
It's called the Paul Harris Fellows Award.

78
00:04:39,655 --> 00:04:46,839
And I'm happy that I have a couple of those because of the time that I put in.

79
00:04:46,859 --> 00:04:47,599
But the club really

80
00:04:51,671 --> 00:04:54,832
There's 45,000 clubs across the globe.

81
00:04:55,072 --> 00:04:56,932
Wow.

82
00:04:56,952 --> 00:04:58,272
1.2 million people are in Rotary.

83
00:04:59,593 --> 00:05:03,113
And you can go to their website, rotary.org, and you can see what they do.

84
00:05:03,173 --> 00:05:04,054
They help people out.

85
00:05:04,234 --> 00:05:10,235
The Rotary International, they primarily have helped eradicate polio across throughout the world.

86
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:10,655
Wow.

87
00:05:10,675 --> 00:05:12,575
Because back in the late 50s when it was

88
00:05:16,376 --> 00:05:17,777
a vaccine was invented.

89
00:05:18,597 --> 00:05:32,344
A lot of, and I remember some people when I was a younger child that had polio, but it's eradicated in the United States, all pretty much, most countries other than third world countries have it completely eradicated.

90
00:05:33,324 --> 00:05:40,728
It's really hard to get the vaccine, but it's a little drop in a baby's mouth and they're vaccinated for life.

91
00:05:41,288 --> 00:05:43,009
That's one that's super successful.

92
00:05:43,489 --> 00:05:44,570
Polio is a terrible disease.

93
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:50,113
Rotary International took that on, but that's nationally.

94
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:56,998
So we, our club, every year gives a little bit of our money to the Rotary International fight against polio.

95
00:05:57,358 --> 00:06:00,981
Bill Gates has given hundreds of millions of dollars in matching grants.

96
00:06:01,241 --> 00:06:06,125
So if we raise $100, or if Rotary International raises it, he matches it, he doubles it with $200.

97
00:06:06,225 --> 00:06:07,486
It's very benevolent.

98
00:06:10,784 --> 00:06:15,908
But our club is one of many clubs in Massachusetts alone.

99
00:06:17,329 --> 00:06:23,133
And we have between 35 to 40 people in our club.

100
00:06:23,313 --> 00:06:27,196
We did it one time when I first joined 20-plus years ago.

101
00:06:28,197 --> 00:06:30,138
We had closer to 50.

102
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:34,601
But as they've aged out and sort of got out of the club,

103
00:06:35,745 --> 00:06:39,668
It's very difficult to get younger people interested.

104
00:06:40,148 --> 00:06:47,714
But I think when they really see what we do, it's easy to get interested in Rotary.

105
00:06:47,814 --> 00:06:49,555
And when people say, well, what is Rotary?

106
00:06:49,935 --> 00:06:54,459
The easiest answer, other than all that stuff I just told you, is what do you guys do?

107
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,521
Well, we raise a bunch of money, and then we give it away.

108
00:06:58,795 --> 00:07:08,837
And the important thing about a benevolent organization like Rotary and Aeronaut Club and all the other clubs is that no one's getting a salary, no one's getting paid, no one takes any profit.

109
00:07:08,897 --> 00:07:15,138
It all gets poured back in to our bank accounts that we have.

110
00:07:15,178 --> 00:07:19,139
We have multiple because certain accounts are for certain things that we do.

111
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:27,280
But other than you think of all the charitable organizations that are known worldwide, American Cancer Society,

112
00:07:27,643 --> 00:07:28,924
There's a lot of people on the payroll.

113
00:07:28,944 --> 00:07:30,946
There's a big budget there.

114
00:07:31,306 --> 00:07:34,528
Our budget really is every month.

115
00:07:34,548 --> 00:07:37,491
I happen to be on the board of directors.

116
00:07:38,532 --> 00:07:43,115
And we review things, benevolent requests, and then we approve them.

117
00:07:43,455 --> 00:07:45,397
But we have to raise money for that.

118
00:07:45,617 --> 00:07:45,897
Right.

119
00:07:46,157 --> 00:07:46,778
Yeah.

120
00:07:46,858 --> 00:07:51,881
So, you know, at the end of the day, we're helping people more locally in our community.

121
00:07:52,341 --> 00:08:01,907
Some Rotary clubs really like to team up with clubs across the globe and help build things and water and cleaning, clean water where people don't have them.

122
00:08:02,147 --> 00:08:08,231
So it's really, you know, for me, you know, you know, you're helping people and you don't always see the face.

123
00:08:08,971 --> 00:08:17,257
Every once in a while, you'll be on the street or you'll be at an event and let's say, hey, you did this for that person.

124
00:08:17,277 --> 00:08:22,060
I know you're in Rotary and it really helped them.

125
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,622
We're not making big money here, but it's helpful.

126
00:08:24,994 --> 00:08:27,316
Let me ask you, core values.

127
00:08:27,476 --> 00:08:29,478
What are the core values?

128
00:08:30,198 --> 00:08:34,742
Rotary's motto is service above self.

129
00:08:34,822 --> 00:08:35,543
It's really simple.

130
00:08:37,805 --> 00:08:39,866
You have to be selfless to serve others.

131
00:08:40,867 --> 00:08:41,227
Correct.

132
00:08:41,448 --> 00:08:45,811
I'll read it because I should know this by heart, but I don't.

133
00:08:46,512 --> 00:08:49,875
Rotary International has what's called a four-way test.

134
00:08:50,515 --> 00:08:59,440
And in the climate we live in today, this should be a test that's required by every one of our leaders, people in public office.

135
00:08:59,861 --> 00:09:02,682
And the test is, is it the truth, number one?

136
00:09:03,723 --> 00:09:06,565
Number two, is it fair for all concerned?

137
00:09:07,425 --> 00:09:11,748
Number three, will it build goodwill and better friendships?

138
00:09:12,528 --> 00:09:16,351
And number four, will it be beneficial to all concerned?

139
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,931
It's really a simple motto, really.

140
00:09:19,012 --> 00:09:19,732
But it's excellent.

141
00:09:20,132 --> 00:09:30,394
And I joke sometimes when you're out and you're at some place and you're grabbing dishes and you're putting them away for Thanksgiving and like, that's really nice, I serve as above self.

142
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:34,975
I mean, it's family, but it's the same core value.

143
00:09:36,135 --> 00:09:41,817
I always feel like if everyone had those core values, we wouldn't have wars, we wouldn't have all of this stuff, hate.

144
00:09:43,317 --> 00:09:45,360
You know, but we need to spread that around.

145
00:09:45,561 --> 00:09:47,063
We're not.

146
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,004
I hear you.

147
00:09:48,285 --> 00:09:49,086
No, I hear you.

148
00:09:49,266 --> 00:09:49,426
Yeah.

149
00:09:49,847 --> 00:09:50,588
Yeah.

150
00:09:50,608 --> 00:09:50,989
100 percent.

151
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:51,309
Right.

152
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:52,852
It'd be nice to spread that around.

153
00:09:55,055 --> 00:09:56,938
Next question, really, I mean, are you guys.

154
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,724
The Rotary, are you associated politically, religious, nothing?

155
00:10:02,784 --> 00:10:06,388
Not at all, not at all.

156
00:10:06,428 --> 00:10:12,853
We've had council people on our city councilors as Rotarians.

157
00:10:13,834 --> 00:10:16,935
The last one was Stephanie Muccini-Burke.

158
00:10:17,195 --> 00:10:19,976
She was on Rotary and very involved.

159
00:10:20,956 --> 00:10:22,056
Good person, Stephanie.

160
00:10:22,076 --> 00:10:26,237
I know Paul Donato is involved in the Kiwanis, Rick Carviello in the Kiwanis.

161
00:10:26,757 --> 00:10:30,918
So they're also not politically aligned with anything.

162
00:10:31,138 --> 00:10:36,680
Rarely do we have politicians come and speak.

163
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:37,660
We usually have

164
00:10:39,081 --> 00:10:41,902
organizations come to our luncheons and speak.

165
00:10:42,263 --> 00:10:43,103
It's nice to know.

166
00:10:43,444 --> 00:10:43,624
Yeah.

167
00:10:44,564 --> 00:10:46,285
So you touched on this a little bit.

168
00:10:46,506 --> 00:10:47,606
I'm always curious.

169
00:10:48,787 --> 00:10:51,949
I think you mentioned, but how did you become involved with the Rotary?

170
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:57,673
Well, as I said, I was asked to come in and that's usually how you get in.

171
00:10:57,993 --> 00:10:58,774
But you know what?

172
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:02,637
People show up at our, we meet twice a month.

173
00:11:03,608 --> 00:11:06,370
at Bertucci's, as long as they're there.

174
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:10,412
But we, I know it's- Not going to be the- Who knows?

175
00:11:10,472 --> 00:11:11,253
Yeah, I know.

176
00:11:11,273 --> 00:11:13,434
We thought they were going to be gone a while ago, but they're still there.

177
00:11:13,454 --> 00:11:14,254
They're still there.

178
00:11:14,415 --> 00:11:18,617
And it's a perfect spot for us because it's kind of centrally located, it's easy to get to.

179
00:11:18,657 --> 00:11:25,901
But we meet the first Thursday of the month for lunch, and the third Wednesday

180
00:11:27,162 --> 00:11:27,722
For dinner.

181
00:11:27,902 --> 00:11:28,562
Oh, that's nice.

182
00:11:28,982 --> 00:11:37,064
And so that way it allows our members to have a cheese I can't make it for lunch, you know, sometimes they just can't do lunches, but I can do dinner at 6 o'clock, right?

183
00:11:37,444 --> 00:11:46,166
So All that stuff's on the website You can find out what you know, when would type what time we're meeting sometimes we like like around Christmas.

184
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:50,267
We don't meet, you know, but But I can talk about the fundraisers.

185
00:11:50,327 --> 00:11:51,047
Okay, so

186
00:11:52,808 --> 00:12:06,165
Obviously everyone is welcome to join right and then you know, I always are there any I do you look for You know skills or talents In a member like is there anything I

187
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:08,559
No, not really.

188
00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:18,328
I mean, it sounds a little odd, but the thing is, most of the people in our club work for businesses in Medford.

189
00:12:18,368 --> 00:12:24,953
Some work outside of Medford, because maybe they move jobs, but they keep coming back to, they stay in our club.

190
00:12:25,493 --> 00:12:31,779
Some of them go to other clubs, like if they move to Wakefield, they might go to the Wakefield Rotary and join that, but they've established,

191
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:35,560
friendships and everything else with the people.

192
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,361
And I just love the people in the club.

193
00:12:38,401 --> 00:12:43,662
They're just, they all have their mind, you know, the same heart, you know, the mindset is the same.

194
00:12:44,062 --> 00:12:48,143
But we welcome anyone.

195
00:12:48,183 --> 00:12:51,584
I mean, it's hard to find young kids because they're so busy.

196
00:12:51,684 --> 00:12:52,804
I mean, everyone's busy, right?

197
00:12:52,864 --> 00:12:56,005
But they have so many things going on that it's hard for them

198
00:12:56,565 --> 00:12:59,409
to take time away if they're starting a new job.

199
00:12:59,949 --> 00:13:03,854
But I would love to have more younger people in the club.

200
00:13:04,675 --> 00:13:08,340
And it's just kind of the nature of clubs like ours.

201
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,062
It's happening everywhere.

202
00:13:10,459 --> 00:13:15,783
But as long as you're 18, or out of high school, you can join our club.

203
00:13:16,324 --> 00:13:21,968
Now, we did have a rotary club in the high school, Medford High, right here.

204
00:13:22,088 --> 00:13:22,749
I remember.

205
00:13:22,909 --> 00:13:24,751
It was called the Interact Club.

206
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:29,274
And we co-sponsored them for some of their events.

207
00:13:29,574 --> 00:13:30,635
They were very active.

208
00:13:30,895 --> 00:13:31,676
Right.

209
00:13:32,116 --> 00:13:35,219
And they would come to our club whenever they had off school.

210
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,841
If they were around, they could come to one of our luncheons and stuff.

211
00:13:38,341 --> 00:13:39,522
But we do get people.

212
00:13:40,482 --> 00:13:51,209
randomly, I check the email, the rotary email, and they'll say, hey, I'm from New Zealand, and we're going to be in Medford because our daughter and son-in-law live there.

213
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,171
Can we come to a meeting?

214
00:13:53,231 --> 00:13:54,412
And I'm like, absolutely.

215
00:13:54,432 --> 00:13:56,093
If you come to a meeting,

216
00:13:56,553 --> 00:13:57,193
will feed you.

217
00:13:57,213 --> 00:14:00,314
It's basically a free meal.

218
00:14:01,354 --> 00:14:03,274
And then you can meet the people.

219
00:14:03,654 --> 00:14:07,595
And a lot of times they'll come back if they revisit.

220
00:14:07,675 --> 00:14:10,216
But there are people that join every year.

221
00:14:10,336 --> 00:14:14,056
We do have some members that, I'm moving to Florida because I'm retiring or something.

222
00:14:14,116 --> 00:14:18,817
But we sort of stay in that same range of amount of people.

223
00:14:19,337 --> 00:14:21,718
But all we really look for is people that really

224
00:14:22,358 --> 00:14:23,999
are interested in helping out.

225
00:14:24,439 --> 00:14:28,340
Don't just be a Rotarian because it looks good on your resume.

226
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,480
It's not one of those clubs.

227
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,521
This is a benevolent club.

228
00:14:31,601 --> 00:14:33,001
We're here to help people.

229
00:14:33,441 --> 00:14:34,821
We're all volunteer.

230
00:14:35,342 --> 00:14:37,162
Everyone's a volunteer.

231
00:14:39,283 --> 00:14:42,764
It's a good core group of people that are always stepping up to the plate.

232
00:14:44,064 --> 00:14:50,866
It's nice for me to hear and for a lot of other people to hear that all the money goes where it's supposed to go.

233
00:14:51,566 --> 00:14:52,667
I mean, that's huge.

234
00:14:52,888 --> 00:14:57,592
I mean, let's be honest, you don't see that as much anymore, put it that way.

235
00:14:57,852 --> 00:14:59,393
Oh, trust me.

236
00:14:59,573 --> 00:15:00,835
I know, I've seen.

237
00:15:01,555 --> 00:15:13,226
Trust me, our treasurer holds it tight, and once it's approved, but we have checks and balances built into our board.

238
00:15:13,886 --> 00:15:15,307
We approve things.

239
00:15:16,328 --> 00:15:22,193
And a lot of them are repeat donations, helping a number of charities throughout the city of Medford.

240
00:15:22,634 --> 00:15:27,097
Our club is really, we like to keep it all in Medford.

241
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:36,145
Sometimes we'll team up with the Somerville or a Winchester or something like that, but for the most part, it stays, the money that we raise, it stays here.

242
00:15:36,165 --> 00:15:38,126
It stays in Medford, well that's nice to know.

243
00:15:39,808 --> 00:15:42,089
So, here's a good question, how do you guys,

244
00:15:43,077 --> 00:15:49,381
You know, the Rotary go about raising funds and then, you know, there's got to be membership fees, I assume.

245
00:15:49,661 --> 00:15:51,362
There is membership fees.

246
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:59,187
I want to say the membership fees, including lunches and dinners, run close to, well,

247
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:03,243
The dinners are like twenty dollars a meal or something.

248
00:16:03,363 --> 00:16:03,604
Yeah.

249
00:16:03,664 --> 00:16:04,564
But it's every other week.

250
00:16:04,604 --> 00:16:05,685
So it's two times a month.

251
00:16:05,725 --> 00:16:06,546
You can do the math.

252
00:16:07,327 --> 00:16:09,729
Rotary International dues aren't that much there.

253
00:16:09,849 --> 00:16:11,610
I think there's seventy five dollars a quarter.

254
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:14,112
So say three hundred dollars a year per member.

255
00:16:14,813 --> 00:16:14,933
Yeah.

256
00:16:14,953 --> 00:16:20,297
And then and then you know we're on our club is on the map.

257
00:16:20,337 --> 00:16:22,279
You know the big rotary website.

258
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:22,659
Right.

259
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:27,763
As once you're a member you know they keep track of how long you've been a member and all that stuff.

260
00:16:27,884 --> 00:16:29,545
And if you're if you're still a member

261
00:16:29,952 --> 00:16:32,693
then our club gets billed, and then we pay them.

262
00:16:32,733 --> 00:16:39,655
But our treasurer, trust me, he's out there with the invoices, and he collects that, and he pays for all that.

263
00:16:39,755 --> 00:16:43,757
And we go through the accounts, the ledger all the time.

264
00:16:45,157 --> 00:16:49,799
But we raise money by having events.

265
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:55,961
And coincidentally, a week from, well, next Wednesday, we're having comedy night.

266
00:16:56,761 --> 00:16:58,943
which is one of our fundraisers we do every year.

267
00:16:59,543 --> 00:17:02,326
And there was a lot of people like, we don't want to watch the same comedians.

268
00:17:02,706 --> 00:17:07,090
And we're having it at Giggles, which is at Prince Pizza on Route 1.

269
00:17:08,231 --> 00:17:09,072
And I was one of them.

270
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:11,333
I'm like, I don't want that comedian because we've seen him.

271
00:17:11,814 --> 00:17:14,216
But this year, we're going to get a new group of comedians.

272
00:17:15,417 --> 00:17:16,998
The cost is $40.

273
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:21,142
And if you do it online, it's $42.

274
00:17:21,202 --> 00:17:22,663
I think you pay the service fee or

275
00:17:22,703 --> 00:17:24,665
or whatever it is, Eventbrite or whatever that is.

276
00:17:25,425 --> 00:17:26,806
But you can do PayPal or Venmo.

277
00:17:26,966 --> 00:17:32,511
So it's 42 bucks and you get all the pizza you can eat, all the soda you can drink.

278
00:17:32,911 --> 00:17:34,412
And if you wanna drink, that's on you.

279
00:17:35,273 --> 00:17:37,915
But it's a good night.

280
00:17:37,935 --> 00:17:41,918
We get three comedians and it's a good social night and it's a lot of fun.

281
00:17:42,218 --> 00:17:49,804
And I brought people from some of my clients in the past and even some of the kids in the office and they've enjoyed themselves.

282
00:17:50,204 --> 00:17:52,945
So that's next Wednesday, the 26th.

283
00:17:53,465 --> 00:17:53,845
OK.

284
00:17:54,406 --> 00:18:03,429
And but our other fundraisers we had in last spring and we're probably going to do it again is the is a meat raffle.

285
00:18:04,129 --> 00:18:05,390
And now it sounds a little weird.

286
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:05,810
I know.

287
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:06,230
Right.

288
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:12,972
And one of the women in our club and she came up with the idea and it was it was a great success.

289
00:18:13,073 --> 00:18:14,793
I think we raised three or four thousand dollars.

290
00:18:14,813 --> 00:18:15,453
No kidding.

291
00:18:15,533 --> 00:18:19,515
By selling basically chances

292
00:18:20,206 --> 00:18:24,569
for to win like $500 or $1,000 a meter or whatever it was.

293
00:18:25,029 --> 00:18:26,810
I don't remember the exact details.

294
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:32,834
And it's all from, I don't know if it's, not Bob's, but Dom's.

295
00:18:32,994 --> 00:18:34,015
Dom's, okay, yeah.

296
00:18:34,055 --> 00:18:40,038
Like Dom's, but the prices of that's gone up, so we're sort of evaluating how we're gonna structure that.

297
00:18:40,499 --> 00:18:42,640
And that was just new last year.

298
00:18:44,521 --> 00:18:49,184
But probably one of our bigger things is the Super Bowl squares raffle.

299
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:51,099
Yeah, that's always big.

300
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:51,359
Yeah.

301
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:51,699
Right.

302
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,341
So I will tell you this.

303
00:18:53,461 --> 00:18:57,804
When Tom Brady was here selling the tickets, they sold out very quickly.

304
00:18:57,904 --> 00:18:58,184
Right.

305
00:18:58,705 --> 00:19:03,949
But this and I basically run that because I have I'm like Mr. Spreadsheet guy.

306
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:08,772
And and yeah, so I have it all down to a system.

307
00:19:09,373 --> 00:19:14,636
And I just everyone knows and that pretty much the same people sell the same amount of tickets every year.

308
00:19:15,277 --> 00:19:16,098
And we always sell out.

309
00:19:16,438 --> 00:19:18,459
So that's that is basically

310
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:19,660
to a

311
00:19:28,848 --> 00:19:30,549
And we give half of that away.

312
00:19:30,729 --> 00:19:32,430
So every quarter is, what, $1,250.

313
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:35,652
So you divide the $5,000, so we get $5,000.

314
00:19:36,172 --> 00:19:39,234
And it's very low lifting.

315
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:48,199
So after January, and I know who the final playoffs, I start, hey, where are we going?

316
00:19:48,239 --> 00:19:49,580
We got the Super Bowl squares.

317
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:57,745
And anyone, if you know a Rotarian and want to go and you want to get a square, I'm telling you, they're very, I never realized, I never did when I was younger, how popular they

318
00:19:57,965 --> 00:19:58,986
Oh, yeah, they are.

319
00:19:59,006 --> 00:20:00,247
A lot of people will play them.

320
00:20:00,267 --> 00:20:00,968
It's crazy.

321
00:20:00,988 --> 00:20:01,848
Yeah, no, I know.

322
00:20:02,088 --> 00:20:04,631
And they're like, hey, Doug, do another one, because we sold out.

323
00:20:04,651 --> 00:20:07,052
And I'm like, no, if you want to do one, you can do it.

324
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:07,753
It's the Super Bowl.

325
00:20:07,813 --> 00:20:08,894
Everyone wants to be involved.

326
00:20:09,014 --> 00:20:13,358
Yeah, well, like I said, when Brady was raking them in, it was easy.

327
00:20:13,718 --> 00:20:16,060
But even last year, we sold out a week in advance.

328
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,322
But everyone wastes, it's like anything else.

329
00:20:18,402 --> 00:20:21,704
Everyone wastes the last minute to do, to shell out the $100.

330
00:20:22,745 --> 00:20:25,847
But it's fun, you know, it's a good thing.

331
00:20:25,867 --> 00:20:28,789
Well you guys are creative in your fundraising, so I like that.

332
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:34,073
And in the past we had a casino night which was spectacular.

333
00:20:34,133 --> 00:20:40,438
We made a lot of money that went directly into our bank.

334
00:20:41,078 --> 00:20:45,359
And we were able to, I think we, when the new library opened, we donated $10,000 to the fund.

335
00:20:45,459 --> 00:20:47,860
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, it's $25,000.

336
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:53,222
And to the library, I think it was maybe a little placard in there or something with our name on it in that list.

337
00:21:01,384 --> 00:21:07,568
in the Bloomberg Library, but we don't do that that often because that's a lot of fundraisers.

338
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:15,013
When we had the casino night up in Melrose Center, we

339
00:21:16,914 --> 00:21:19,236
We did very well, and it was a lot of fun.

340
00:21:19,636 --> 00:21:21,757
But you know, so these fundraisers run their course.

341
00:21:21,857 --> 00:21:24,318
Super Bowl squares never run in their course.

342
00:21:24,338 --> 00:21:29,101
But the meat raffle might last another year or two, and then we'll have to come up with another way.

343
00:21:29,381 --> 00:21:32,623
But basically, we raise that money, and then we give it away.

344
00:21:33,944 --> 00:21:35,605
We kind of break even at the end of the year.

345
00:21:35,685 --> 00:21:40,168
Sometimes if we have a little left over, we throw it into what our biggest giveaway is.

346
00:21:41,348 --> 00:21:43,869
is the holiday food baskets.

347
00:21:44,089 --> 00:21:46,030
Okay, yeah, I know about those.

348
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:59,335
Right, so, not last year, year before last, I just happened to be on one of the Medford websites, and I saw that the city was giving out $10,000 grant money.

349
00:21:59,895 --> 00:22:08,779
So that year, we applied for it, we got it, we totally qualified for it because it was going directly to the food basket program.

350
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:13,282
Every year that I've been involved in Rotary, we've done 200 or more.

351
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:14,523
That year we did 250.

352
00:22:15,603 --> 00:22:31,432
And basically what it is, we used to pack the boxes, and I don't know if you have some of the photos that I sent, but there's basically, we work with the high school kids, they collect, the high school vocational school, they collect canned goods.

353
00:22:31,492 --> 00:22:32,033
They used to.

354
00:22:32,733 --> 00:22:33,554
And then COVID hit.

355
00:22:34,014 --> 00:22:35,295
So now what do we do?

356
00:22:35,935 --> 00:22:44,622
So we changed course, and it's less, like I said, it's less lifting for the high school kids, although they loved doing it.

357
00:22:45,122 --> 00:22:53,148
All the Rotarians, we'd go and we'd pack, and every one of those boxes was filled with a turkey, and basically a big Thanksgiving dinner for about eight people.

358
00:22:53,948 --> 00:22:59,492
And it was great because you're lugging these things in, and so many people appreciated those.

359
00:22:59,792 --> 00:23:00,113
Now,

360
00:23:00,913 --> 00:23:04,955
It's a gift card from Wegmans.

361
00:23:05,095 --> 00:23:05,716
Oh, that's fine.

362
00:23:05,836 --> 00:23:11,258
So we work with Wegmans on a grocery list, which is the same that we used to put in.

363
00:23:11,819 --> 00:23:15,541
And last year, I think it was $60 or $65 card.

364
00:23:15,841 --> 00:23:21,504
You don't think it's that much, but if you go in with that list, you can buy all of the Wegmans stuff and pack.

365
00:23:21,944 --> 00:23:23,165
So now we give out the gift cards.

366
00:23:23,525 --> 00:23:27,887
And some people may not want, we don't want the wafers or whatever, and they can do what they want with it.

367
00:23:28,247 --> 00:23:30,088
I'm going to tell you right now, right?

368
00:23:30,268 --> 00:23:32,528
I know all the things you're talking about.

369
00:23:33,089 --> 00:23:34,349
I know of a couple of them.

370
00:23:34,989 --> 00:23:35,249
Sure.

371
00:23:35,369 --> 00:23:35,529
OK?

372
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:39,771
But it's so good to have you on the show so people understand.

373
00:23:39,831 --> 00:23:40,011
Yeah.

374
00:23:40,251 --> 00:23:43,392
Because there's so much good going on in Medford.

375
00:23:43,592 --> 00:23:44,132
Absolutely.

376
00:23:44,352 --> 00:23:47,233
And you know, it's just nice.

377
00:23:47,313 --> 00:23:48,614
It's nice to hear about it.

378
00:23:48,734 --> 00:23:51,195
It's nice to know what you do.

379
00:23:52,515 --> 00:23:57,377
You know, I always now, correct me if I'm wrong, you guys always had a scholarship fund.

380
00:23:58,177 --> 00:24:00,880
Because I do remember that I'm glad you brought that up.

381
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:06,566
Yeah, we give away Scholarships to graduating high school seniors that live in Medford.

382
00:24:07,267 --> 00:24:13,293
They don't have to go to Medford High They can go to a vocational school someone we have we've had some four-minute man, right?

383
00:24:13,653 --> 00:24:20,200
We've had some from you know other high schools in the surrounding area, you know parochial high schools, whatever and

384
00:24:20,976 --> 00:24:29,083
Matignon, you know some of those other schools and as long as they live in Medford and are graduating senior they can apply for the scholarship.

385
00:24:29,564 --> 00:24:46,318
Now the scholarship in about two or three months before they're ready to graduate we post on our website and we tell the the guidance department here at the school and all of the schools are aware that

386
00:24:46,698 --> 00:24:48,820
If you have any kids from Medford, they should apply.

387
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,922
And there's requirements, right?

388
00:24:52,223 --> 00:24:59,088
Academic, there's volunteer requirements, and you know, you have to, and there's, we gave away last year $12,000 or $13,000.

389
00:24:59,488 --> 00:25:05,953
So, and you know, I mean, it's not much these days, but it's $2,000 per kid.

390
00:25:08,855 --> 00:25:09,716
It helps.

391
00:25:09,856 --> 00:25:12,097
A couple thousand dollars is probably your books.

392
00:25:12,157 --> 00:25:15,199
No, but still, it's off their backs.

393
00:25:15,299 --> 00:25:16,119
Every little bit helps.

394
00:25:16,199 --> 00:25:17,320
Every little bit helps.

395
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:21,162
And sometimes you just think like, why aren't more of these kids applying?

396
00:25:22,023 --> 00:25:24,484
And last year we had quite a few.

397
00:25:25,425 --> 00:25:34,490
And every year we have a scholarship dinner, which is usually in June, right around that they may have just ready to technically graduate, but they're out of school.

398
00:25:35,205 --> 00:25:39,446
And we invite the parents so they can come and we present them with the check.

399
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:43,788
And we have it over at, we've been having it at Avellino's in their little function area.

400
00:25:43,808 --> 00:25:45,648
Right, Avellino's in that function room, yeah.

401
00:25:45,668 --> 00:25:49,209
And I tell you, last year the kids were phenomenal.

402
00:25:49,809 --> 00:25:50,670
Like, whoa.

403
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:51,790
Good.

404
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:57,812
Two girls that were twins graduated from Medford and top two in the class.

405
00:25:58,512 --> 00:26:01,993
And one was going to Harvard and one was going to Yale, or they were both going to Harvard.

406
00:26:02,013 --> 00:26:04,473
I mean, their qualifications were insane.

407
00:26:05,453 --> 00:26:11,635
And I'm like, how do you, it's just, it wasn't because, they just were involved in everything.

408
00:26:11,915 --> 00:26:14,995
It wasn't just, okay, I got good grades, hand me the money.

409
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:17,556
No, you have to be doing a little bit more than that.

410
00:26:17,736 --> 00:26:22,877
And they were doing above and beyond what I ever would have imagined at that age when I was younger.

411
00:26:22,897 --> 00:26:27,178
I'm glad we're doing the show, because I tell you, the word gets out, a lot of people,

412
00:26:28,418 --> 00:26:28,819
Yeah.

413
00:26:28,959 --> 00:26:30,820
They're going to be learning a lot about the rotary.

414
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,440
Look at it.

415
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:36,363
Look on the website, medfordrotaryclub.org or something like that.

416
00:26:36,403 --> 00:26:39,205
Look on the website in the spring.

417
00:26:39,725 --> 00:26:43,187
And then Ed and myself will post.

418
00:26:43,367 --> 00:26:46,289
There'll be a form you can just download PDF.

419
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:52,173
But they should be able to get it from also the guidance department because we let them know.

420
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:54,014
We'll get the website up on the screen.

421
00:26:54,674 --> 00:26:55,855
So do you have a, I'm sorry.

422
00:26:56,355 --> 00:26:57,215
I just want to add one.

423
00:26:57,296 --> 00:26:57,956
We do have.

424
00:26:58,056 --> 00:26:59,877
Here's the hardest scholarship to give away.

425
00:27:01,137 --> 00:27:02,818
Several years ago, we had a Rotarian.

426
00:27:02,858 --> 00:27:04,638
His name was Ed Jaskalian.

427
00:27:04,999 --> 00:27:06,159
He was a Rotarian forever.

428
00:27:06,719 --> 00:27:09,621
And I only had 40 or 50 years in Rotary.

429
00:27:09,941 --> 00:27:16,023
He passed away and he left a scholarship of twenty five, twenty five thousand dollars to give out.

430
00:27:16,523 --> 00:27:19,284
You know, not all of it at once, but to use.

431
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:24,447
So what we do is we have that like a fund in the the the interest that spun off of it.

432
00:27:24,527 --> 00:27:25,587
We give scholarships away.

433
00:27:26,223 --> 00:27:29,165
but that's for someone that's going into a vocational school.

434
00:27:29,245 --> 00:27:42,431
And I think today you see more kids doing that, whether they want to be an electrician or work in a machine shop or something, and they're in some sort of a program, they can apply for that scholarship.

435
00:27:42,732 --> 00:27:46,974
And we've had several years where no one applies for it because it's tricky.

436
00:27:46,994 --> 00:27:50,956
But I think that this year we had several apply, which is encouraging because

437
00:27:51,296 --> 00:27:53,558
You don't have to, not everyone wants to go to college.

438
00:27:53,638 --> 00:27:54,859
Not everyone has to go to college.

439
00:27:54,879 --> 00:27:56,841
You can be just as successful without it.

440
00:27:57,061 --> 00:27:58,303
But that's nice to have that.

441
00:27:58,443 --> 00:28:04,669
Once the word gets out, you know, I think people, you'll get more applications.

442
00:28:04,789 --> 00:28:05,549
I hope so.

443
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:06,410
Yeah, you will.

444
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:07,952
Because I've never heard of that.

445
00:28:08,132 --> 00:28:14,297
And I'm just, you know, I know a lot about what's going on in Method, but I've never ever heard of that.

446
00:28:15,478 --> 00:28:16,919
I'm learning a lot today.

447
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,181
I'm so glad you come on Doug.

448
00:28:20,001 --> 00:28:22,303
So, you know, this will be, we'll finish up the show.

449
00:28:23,543 --> 00:28:25,445
Do you have a location in Method?

450
00:28:25,485 --> 00:28:28,947
I mean, we'll put up your website and everything else, but is there a location?

451
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:31,028
will

452
00:28:49,772 --> 00:28:51,873
you know, on on a regular basis.

453
00:28:52,613 --> 00:28:54,474
And and they're all from all different.

454
00:28:54,534 --> 00:28:55,574
We have attorneys.

455
00:28:55,634 --> 00:28:56,914
We have dentists.

456
00:28:57,014 --> 00:28:58,875
We've got the only architect.

457
00:28:58,895 --> 00:29:05,037
So, you know, but a lot of a lot of people from financial people.

458
00:29:05,737 --> 00:29:07,518
and they're just good people.

459
00:29:07,658 --> 00:29:17,382
And we have fun, we use a lot of laughs, and we do a little business for the meeting, talk about what functions we're doing.

460
00:29:18,443 --> 00:29:24,886
I mean, really one of my favorite things that we do is we give dictionaries, and that's gonna be happening in the next month.

461
00:29:25,086 --> 00:29:29,548
We give dictionaries to every third grader in Medford, parochial and high school.

462
00:29:30,388 --> 00:29:47,475
So we, at the beginning of the year, they give us the numbers, and then we, this year I think it's like 450 dictionaries we order, and they get a little bookmark in there, and then we take them out and we give them, and the kids are just, they just like, they don't get to keep the books.

463
00:29:47,775 --> 00:29:49,596
These books, they keep them forever.

464
00:29:50,056 --> 00:29:59,420
My favorite, my favorite tail end of that is, I was doing one of the things over at McGlynn years ago, and a girl came in and she says,

465
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:03,621
she was out of high school, and she says, I'm in college.

466
00:30:03,742 --> 00:30:06,142
And I still use that dictionary I got in third grade.

467
00:30:06,303 --> 00:30:09,424
It's rare today, because everyone's got their cell phones, right?

468
00:30:09,824 --> 00:30:14,346
But the kids, they love it, because they got something physical they can take home, and it's their own.

469
00:30:14,566 --> 00:30:15,646
They put their name in it.

470
00:30:15,666 --> 00:30:16,567
They write their name in it.

471
00:30:16,947 --> 00:30:17,907
It's very cool.

472
00:30:17,987 --> 00:30:19,048
That's very nice.

473
00:30:19,168 --> 00:30:20,548
And the kids love it.

474
00:30:20,628 --> 00:30:21,229
It's so much fun.

475
00:30:22,349 --> 00:30:25,272
Well, you know, thank you for coming on the show.

476
00:30:25,372 --> 00:30:25,852
My pleasure.

477
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:32,658
Honestly, I learned a lot, and I'm sure the audience is going to learn a lot.

478
00:30:32,718 --> 00:30:33,139
I hope so.

479
00:30:33,659 --> 00:30:34,960
Really, thank you so much.

480
00:30:35,561 --> 00:30:47,191
So, we are getting near the end, so I just want to thank our guest, Doug Shoup, for introducing our audience to the Method Rotary Club.

481
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:51,482
That was, you did a great job, great job, great job.

482
00:30:51,522 --> 00:30:52,802
Well, I've never lost for words.

483
00:30:52,823 --> 00:30:53,043
Yeah.

484
00:30:53,063 --> 00:30:53,823
I think most people.

485
00:30:54,303 --> 00:30:55,764
No, no, but great job.

486
