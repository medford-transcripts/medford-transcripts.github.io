1
00:00:03,113 --> 00:00:06,036
Welcome everybody, it is 7.03 p.m.

2
00:00:06,476 --> 00:00:08,077
and the committee is here.

3
00:00:08,098 --> 00:00:15,363
This is the Ad Hoc Small Cell Committee, April 14th, 2021, 7 p.m.

4
00:00:15,904 --> 00:00:20,768
This meeting is a continuation of the meeting originally began on March 31st, 2021 at 6 p.m.

5
00:00:20,828 --> 00:00:23,630
and it was further continued on April 8th, 2021 at 6.30 p.m.

6
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,131
and then continued until tonight.

7
00:00:33,197 --> 00:00:34,438
I'll call the meeting to order.

8
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:43,643
We'll hold a hearing for Verizon applications for 20 proposed small cell infrastructure in the city of Medford.

9
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:52,828
And this is obviously over Zoom, so I'll read the governor's preamble.

10
00:00:56,278 --> 00:01:18,185
Pursuant to Governor Baker's March 12th, 2020 order, suspending certain provisions of the Open Meeting Law, Chapter 30A, Section 18, and the Governor's subsequent order imposing strict limitation on the number of people that may gather in one place, this meeting of the Medford Ad Hoc Small Cell Committee will be conducted via remote participation to the greatest extent possible.

11
00:01:19,085 --> 00:01:25,507
Specific information and the general guidelines for remote participation by members of the public and or parties with a right

12
00:01:26,008 --> 00:01:34,194
and or requirement to attend this meeting can be found on the city of Medford website at www.medfordma.org.

13
00:01:34,955 --> 00:01:43,942
For this meeting, members of the public who wish to listen or watch the meeting may do so by viewing the meeting on cable access or online through Medford Community Media's YouTube channel.

14
00:01:44,922 --> 00:01:54,249
No in-person attendance of members of the public will be permitted, but every effort will be made to ensure that the public can adequately access the proceedings in real time via technological means.

15
00:01:55,091 --> 00:02:09,514
In the event that we are unable to do so, despite best efforts, we will post on the City of Medford or Medford Community Media website, an audio or video recording, transcript or other comprehensive record of proceedings as soon as possible after the meeting.

16
00:02:15,595 --> 00:02:17,316
The meeting ID for Zoom is 941-4275-7380, passcode 417983.

17
00:02:24,743 --> 00:02:25,844
Call-in information is 1-929-205-6099.

18
00:02:25,864 --> 00:02:27,685
The meeting ID, again, is 941-4275-7380.

19
00:02:27,766 --> 00:02:29,207
And this meeting is being recorded.

20
00:02:29,227 --> 00:02:31,248
All right, so first we'll do a recap.

21
00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:32,610
Welcome, everybody.

22
00:02:54,686 --> 00:02:56,887
I will do a recap of the April 8th meeting.

23
00:02:57,188 --> 00:03:00,150
A couple of reminders too.

24
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:01,891
Sorry, go ahead.

25
00:03:01,911 --> 00:03:06,914
Sorry, before you get to the recap, while you're open, do you want to just introduce the other committee members?

26
00:03:07,434 --> 00:03:07,714
Sure.

27
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:10,096
Just so anyone knows who they are.

28
00:03:10,216 --> 00:03:10,476
Thanks.

29
00:03:10,576 --> 00:03:10,916
Thank you.

30
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:12,450
Oh, that's okay.

31
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:12,590
Yep.

32
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:12,930
All right.

33
00:03:13,171 --> 00:03:14,691
I kind of got ahead of myself there too, Robin.

34
00:03:14,711 --> 00:03:16,632
I'm not, I'm not following my script the way I wrote it.

35
00:03:16,672 --> 00:03:18,853
So, um, I'll just go through my script.

36
00:03:18,873 --> 00:03:19,753
I have that before that.

37
00:03:19,793 --> 00:03:29,418
So, um, just a reminder to everybody we're operating under the interim policy for small cell wireless installation, which is a result of an FCC declaratory ruling and order.

38
00:03:30,278 --> 00:03:34,660
I'm going to re, uh, I'm going to introduce the committee, uh, Paul Moki, the building commissioner.

39
00:03:35,487 --> 00:03:43,011
Maryann O'Connor, Director of Public Health, Alicia Hunt, Director of Office of Community Development, and myself, Tim McGivern, City Engineer.

40
00:03:46,792 --> 00:03:53,836
At the continued hearing on the 8th, the committee reviewed and moved on 24 of the 44 locations.

41
00:03:53,856 --> 00:04:01,720
101 Sheridan was taken out of order due to significant public interest in that specific location.

42
00:04:03,373 --> 00:04:13,161
and the general conditions that we created and voted on will be listed before going into the next location.

43
00:04:19,086 --> 00:04:20,867
Reminder of the rules of the hearing.

44
00:04:21,848 --> 00:04:26,232
Please use the raise hand function if you'd like to comment during the public participation period.

45
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:29,375
We'll have staff make sure that

46
00:04:30,577 --> 00:04:35,661
We're keeping track of who would like to speak during the specific locations.

47
00:04:37,122 --> 00:04:39,984
Please direct comments and questions to the chair, me.

48
00:04:41,425 --> 00:04:44,908
No profanity, name calling or other rude or disruptive behavior.

49
00:04:44,928 --> 00:04:49,851
I reserve the right to mute participants who become disruptive to the proceedings.

50
00:04:51,072 --> 00:04:54,275
Each speaker during public participation will receive two minutes.

51
00:04:57,266 --> 00:05:10,573
We did have a general comment period of significant length at the first hearing when we started, and tonight the public commentary will be focused on the site-specific.

52
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:16,636
And then the site-specific comment should be relative to the site under consideration.

53
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:27,796
All right, the next thing is an overview of the standard conditions as established by the committee on March 31st, 2021.

54
00:05:27,936 --> 00:05:33,117
And then also on, we added a couple on the 8th, April 8th.

55
00:05:33,737 --> 00:05:39,058
So Robin, if you are prepared to list those out for us, that would be helpful.

56
00:05:39,078 --> 00:05:41,659
I can just give you a summary.

57
00:05:41,999 --> 00:05:46,800
The first eight from the first meeting were that prior to installation of any equipment,

58
00:05:47,466 --> 00:05:56,793
Verizon is going to comply with section 2F of the policy, which is to provide certifications by a registered professional engineer that the home location will safely support the proposed equipment.

59
00:05:57,614 --> 00:06:00,296
The second one was a prior installation of equipment.

60
00:06:00,316 --> 00:06:08,302
Verizon will comply with section 2H, which has to do with the affidavit of the radio frequency engineer.

61
00:06:08,322 --> 00:06:11,204
I'm not gonna read the whole thing, but it's section 2H of the policy.

62
00:06:12,766 --> 00:06:13,046
Again,

63
00:06:13,616 --> 00:06:21,600
With reference to the policy prior to installation, Verizon is going to provide updated insurance certificates as required in the policy.

64
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:34,046
Verizon will cover the cost of any so-called make-ready work for any installations related to moving or relocating any city-owned lights or infrastructure on any existing poles or anywhere.

65
00:06:34,066 --> 00:06:37,248
Verizon will not install any equipment on double poles.

66
00:06:37,468 --> 00:06:41,910
If a new pole is being installed in the future, that'll cause removal of the double pole before installing.

67
00:06:42,573 --> 00:06:44,695
their equipment on the new pole.

68
00:06:46,217 --> 00:06:50,721
Verizon will confirm prior to installation that all ADA requirements are met.

69
00:06:52,022 --> 00:06:58,249
There will be no noise detectable to human ear at the pole location on the ground and at the nearest residence.

70
00:06:58,869 --> 00:07:02,073
With reference to section 2L of the policy,

71
00:07:02,965 --> 00:07:21,314
Verizon is going to provide an affidavit which certifies that it will maintain the installations in repair and according to FCC standards, that they'll remove any installation that is not in good repair or not in use in 30 days of no longer being in use or not being in good repair, and that they will in fact keep the equipment in good repair.

72
00:07:21,334 --> 00:07:26,376
Let me see, was that eight, one, two, three, four, five.

73
00:07:27,194 --> 00:07:28,154
six, seven, eight.

74
00:07:28,334 --> 00:07:29,495
So that was the first eight.

75
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:33,215
And then at the meeting on the eighth, there were four additional adopted for a total of 12.

76
00:07:33,295 --> 00:07:44,298
The four additional were just clarifying that Verizon is still gonna need to comply with any other state, local, and federal requirements, including, for example, obtaining electrical permits to the extent necessary.

77
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:50,760
The concrete base of the utility, Paul, shall be installed or repaired to city sidewalk standards.

78
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,001
And that is in conjunction with the installation before use of the facility, I believe.

79
00:07:58,802 --> 00:08:19,360
And the next one was that any grant of location for once the installation is not complete within one year of the decision or the vote tonight shall the grant of location shall expire and a new application shall be required, provided that the applicant may seek a six month extension for the time to install the equipment.

80
00:08:20,276 --> 00:08:32,820
And the Verizon will provide written notification to residents within a hundred feet of installation, explaining the nature of the equipment, the description of the physical standards, and they will do so 30 days before any anticipated installation.

81
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:39,602
And that information will also include where residents can contact Verizon if there are any issues or problems with the equipment.

82
00:08:41,002 --> 00:08:48,324
Those are essentially the conditions the board voted and adopted to apply to each application.

83
00:08:49,585 --> 00:08:50,025
Thank you very much.

84
00:08:50,065 --> 00:08:59,072
In addition, I'll just note that there were some individual votes where the board also voted additional conditions that were site-specific.

85
00:09:00,133 --> 00:09:00,673
Thank you very much.

86
00:09:01,294 --> 00:09:08,419
Before we move on, I noticed there are some councilors here, city councilors.

87
00:09:08,939 --> 00:09:12,422
Would city councilors like to speak before we get into the site-specific?

88
00:09:15,864 --> 00:09:16,365
Councilor Marks?

89
00:09:17,718 --> 00:09:19,739
you can keep it to a couple minutes, that would be appreciated.

90
00:09:20,659 --> 00:09:21,119
Thank you very much.

91
00:09:21,139 --> 00:09:26,801
You can go ahead and unmute Council Member.

92
00:09:31,463 --> 00:09:32,303
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

93
00:09:33,203 --> 00:09:35,624
I had a question and I'll be very brief.

94
00:09:36,985 --> 00:09:46,528
If Verizon can explain how many of the polls that they plan on putting the 5G on were poll extensions.

95
00:09:51,084 --> 00:09:51,925
All right, thank you very much.

96
00:09:52,445 --> 00:09:53,886
Verizon, could you address that question?

97
00:09:53,926 --> 00:10:04,735
I think, actually, I wanna just clarify, when you say poll extensions, you mean replace the poll with a longer poll, or do you mean like putting more poll on top of an existing poll?

98
00:10:05,876 --> 00:10:14,102
Whatever the city would consider being an extension to a poll, that would be an answer that, or a question that should be answered by the city.

99
00:10:16,344 --> 00:10:19,767
So whatever the city deems as a poll extension,

100
00:10:22,516 --> 00:10:22,776
Okay.

101
00:10:31,824 --> 00:10:40,891
I would say that if you're increasing the length of a poll or the height of a poll, you're taking a poll and you're extending the length of it.

102
00:10:41,311 --> 00:10:47,716
So if I'm interpreting the question correctly, I think Verizon can address it.

103
00:10:49,266 --> 00:10:56,891
How many poles are being lengthened or extended in order to reach the height you need to reach?

104
00:11:05,017 --> 00:11:05,277
Thank you.

105
00:11:05,417 --> 00:11:08,299
Go ahead, Sean.

106
00:11:23,438 --> 00:11:24,278
Sean, you're muted.

107
00:11:24,298 --> 00:11:29,060
Thank you.

108
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:39,545
Okay, so for polls that are being extended, we don't have any that are being extended per se, but for polls that are being replaced, I can get that number for you.

109
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:41,545
We're just trying to pull it together right here real quick.

110
00:11:44,987 --> 00:11:52,450
Maybe what we can do, Sean, is once you have the answer to that question, if you want to let me know and we'll let you speak on it.

111
00:11:54,128 --> 00:11:54,608
Absolutely.

112
00:11:55,389 --> 00:11:56,089
Yep, thank you.

113
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:57,690
All right, thank you very much.

114
00:11:58,451 --> 00:11:59,832
So, Mr. Chair, just if I could.

115
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:00,512
Yep.

116
00:12:00,973 --> 00:12:13,421
Just so we're on the same page, and Sean may know this, or maybe the Superintendent of Wye is for the city, is that the only type of extension when a poll is actually extended beyond its existing height?

117
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:18,604
On the applications, I believe, yeah.

118
00:12:20,431 --> 00:12:23,892
Some of the applications include replacing the pole with a taller pole.

119
00:12:25,152 --> 00:12:26,993
So that would be what I would consider extension.

120
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:34,895
There are no applications that I recall at all that had attaching more pole onto the top of an existing pole.

121
00:12:36,616 --> 00:12:36,816
Okay.

122
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:42,057
So the actual device, Mr. Chair, wouldn't be considered an extension.

123
00:12:42,677 --> 00:12:44,898
The actual antenna itself, the 5G antenna.

124
00:12:46,908 --> 00:12:47,949
No, not at the pole itself.

125
00:12:48,009 --> 00:12:51,751
No, the pole would be the wooden pole.

126
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:52,511
Right.

127
00:12:52,551 --> 00:12:56,993
So the actual 5G antenna wouldn't be considered an extension of a pole.

128
00:12:58,174 --> 00:13:00,195
It'll sit on top of the pole.

129
00:13:02,016 --> 00:13:03,116
Right.

130
00:13:04,057 --> 00:13:04,237
Right.

131
00:13:04,337 --> 00:13:05,457
So that's my question.

132
00:13:05,477 --> 00:13:08,179
Would that be considered an extension of the pole?

133
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,921
I don't think so.

134
00:13:13,527 --> 00:13:14,167
I don't think so.

135
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:18,948
The pole itself is the pole and then the antenna is mounted on the pole.

136
00:13:19,288 --> 00:13:21,408
So anything attached to the pole wouldn't be considered the pole.

137
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,770
So Sean, what's your last name, Sean?

138
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:33,731
Sorry, it's not written.

139
00:13:38,832 --> 00:13:39,492
You're muted, sorry.

140
00:13:39,512 --> 00:13:40,312
It's Conway.

141
00:13:40,772 --> 00:13:41,332
Conway, okay.

142
00:13:42,304 --> 00:13:47,509
I was going to call you Mr. Conway, but I didn't want to call you Mr. C. Thank you.

143
00:13:47,549 --> 00:13:47,649
Yeah.

144
00:13:47,669 --> 00:13:47,789
Okay.

145
00:13:47,809 --> 00:13:50,992
So when you have that number, just let me know and you can speak to that.

146
00:13:53,414 --> 00:13:53,734
I will.

147
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:54,135
Thank you.

148
00:13:54,155 --> 00:13:54,955
Okay.

149
00:13:57,077 --> 00:13:57,337
All right.

150
00:13:59,719 --> 00:14:00,280
Thank you very much.

151
00:14:03,463 --> 00:14:06,926
So we left off last time talking about one-on-one shared nav.

152
00:14:07,106 --> 00:14:07,967
It was taken out of order.

153
00:14:09,193 --> 00:14:21,238
So the first thing I would like to do is see if there's a motion from the committee to take the agenda out of order to continue the conversation on 101 Sheridan Avenue, if that suits the committee.

154
00:14:23,138 --> 00:14:25,880
I'll make a motion to remove 101 Sheridan Avenue out of order.

155
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,940
Second.

156
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:29,461
Second, Alicia.

157
00:14:30,982 --> 00:14:31,342
All right.

158
00:14:33,142 --> 00:14:34,783
Take a vote, Alicia Hunt.

159
00:14:35,123 --> 00:14:35,443
Yes.

160
00:14:36,564 --> 00:14:37,164
Mary Ann O'Connor.

161
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:43,510
And she's muted.

162
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:47,072
Sorry, yes.

163
00:14:47,952 --> 00:14:48,352
Paul Moki?

164
00:14:49,052 --> 00:14:49,292
Yes.

165
00:14:50,733 --> 00:14:50,993
And me?

166
00:14:51,093 --> 00:14:51,253
Yep.

167
00:14:52,173 --> 00:14:52,373
Yes.

168
00:14:53,454 --> 00:14:53,674
Okay.

169
00:14:55,495 --> 00:15:02,257
So since the last meeting, I've received additional comments regarding 101 Sheridan Ave from Ms.

170
00:15:02,297 --> 00:15:02,937
Barbara Kendall.

171
00:15:03,337 --> 00:15:04,518
I've spoken with her a couple of times.

172
00:15:05,258 --> 00:15:10,300
And just so the committee knows, there is a petition that approximately 20

173
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:13,001
20 residents that live on Sheridan Avenue.

174
00:15:13,661 --> 00:15:14,863
I mapped the petitions today.

175
00:15:14,883 --> 00:15:21,870
It's all but three homes within 200 feet on Sheridan Avenue of the poll location.

176
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:29,418
Let me just read the language of what they signed onto.

177
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:47,357
Resident petition to city council and small cell committee of the city of Medford Mass opposing 5G cell tower at 101 Sheridan Avenue, Medford Mass, application number 29.

178
00:15:48,898 --> 00:15:49,779
So those are the signatures.

179
00:15:50,199 --> 00:16:00,367
And like I said, if the committee wants, I can bring the map up and show you, but basically within 200 feet along Sheridan Avenue, both directions, except for three houses, basically.

180
00:16:02,453 --> 00:16:04,654
There's that, and then also Ms.

181
00:16:04,674 --> 00:16:22,880
Kendall provided a map, and I sent it to the committee members today as well, with a number of poles in the vicinity that appear to meet the criteria for Verizon.

182
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:26,201
Three of them are in Farragut Avenue, one's on Hooker Street.

183
00:16:27,822 --> 00:16:27,982
So,

184
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:50,205
When I look at this information and I look at our policy, well, before I go there, last time I did ask Verizon to take a closer look, even though they did state they did the due diligence, but I did ask them to take a look at alternate poll locations for 101 Sheridan Avenue.

185
00:16:51,225 --> 00:17:00,007
I know they looked at a few on Sheridan Avenue, and I know they've made the statement in their application that it's a superior location.

186
00:17:01,903 --> 00:17:03,465
But it would be up to the applicant to demonstrate that.

187
00:17:04,205 --> 00:17:10,552
So what I'd like to ask is if Verizon did take a look at that and to update the committee, please.

188
00:17:14,816 --> 00:17:15,116
Hi, Tim.

189
00:17:15,156 --> 00:17:15,697
It's Sean again.

190
00:17:15,717 --> 00:17:16,998
And I can take that.

191
00:17:17,018 --> 00:17:20,562
Thank you, Tim and small cell committee for having us again tonight.

192
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:27,863
Um, we did, you know, as, as mentioned before, we do substantial due diligence upfront to make sure we're picking a good poll.

193
00:17:28,323 --> 00:17:36,626
And that as explained in our original, um, presentation, many locations, we can't use per the utilities guidelines that are set forth for us.

194
00:17:37,226 --> 00:17:40,747
So we went back out and we did do further due diligence.

195
00:17:41,668 --> 00:17:43,668
Um, we looked at Sheridan Ave.

196
00:17:44,709 --> 00:17:47,230
There's pretty much zero polls on Sharon Ave.

197
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:47,950
They're usable.

198
00:17:48,788 --> 00:17:55,634
We too did come up with three poll locations on Farragut Avenue that we thought would work as well.

199
00:17:56,655 --> 00:17:59,937
We can kind of go through those locations if you'd like to go through them.

200
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,842
I have a map that I can kind of show you based off of what we've done.

201
00:18:05,902 --> 00:18:07,824
If you'd like me to share that, I can do that as well.

202
00:18:08,525 --> 00:18:09,345
Yeah, let's do that, Sean.

203
00:18:09,365 --> 00:18:09,926
Thank you very much.

204
00:18:10,907 --> 00:18:11,087
Okay.

205
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:23,583
So can you see the map here?

206
00:18:24,183 --> 00:18:24,504
Not yet.

207
00:18:24,644 --> 00:18:25,064
OK.

208
00:18:39,776 --> 00:18:40,437
Now can we see it?

209
00:18:41,498 --> 00:18:41,718
Yes.

210
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:44,460
OK.

211
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:49,344
So to the right here, where you see all the yellow pushpins, that's Sheridan Avenue.

212
00:18:50,392 --> 00:18:52,532
you'll see several dots that are on this map.

213
00:18:52,953 --> 00:18:58,474
The dots that are in blue are other small cell locations that were filed within these 44 applications.

214
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:06,816
There's also a couple green dots on the map that you'll see that are locations that we had planned to file further to complete the 5G network in this neighborhood.

215
00:19:07,736 --> 00:19:15,778
So as mentioned, the blue dot right here in the middle is 101 Sheridan Ave, the location that we selected.

216
00:19:18,664 --> 00:19:24,969
All the poles on Sharon Ave have either reclosers, a transformer, or something else in the pole that don't allow us to use them.

217
00:19:25,369 --> 00:19:27,531
We looked at a lot of those poles last week in the meeting.

218
00:19:28,411 --> 00:19:38,779
We go up to that one pole that's on Hooker Ave, that had a telco box on it, and we get to that next pole on the corner of Grant Ave, you can see there's another node just to the north of it there.

219
00:19:38,859 --> 00:19:47,566
So the nodes would just be too overlapping at that point, and doesn't help to have the contiguous network that we need in the neighborhood to cover the neighborhood as well as RF would like it.

220
00:19:49,452 --> 00:19:50,952
We did go down and look at Farragut.

221
00:19:50,972 --> 00:19:52,312
We'd look at Farragut Ave as well.

222
00:19:52,332 --> 00:19:57,493
On the southern end of Farragut Ave, both the poles there have a transformer or reclosers.

223
00:19:57,513 --> 00:20:02,514
They're also close to a location that we're using across from the old Franklin School.

224
00:20:04,215 --> 00:20:07,135
Now you get into the locations that we thought we could use.

225
00:20:08,475 --> 00:20:12,776
These locations are not much different than the location on 101 Sheridan Ave.

226
00:20:13,456 --> 00:20:18,857
A couple of them are even closer to homes, but I can go ahead and kind of show you here on the map.

227
00:20:19,486 --> 00:20:20,987
So the first location here was pole 15, 17.

228
00:20:21,127 --> 00:20:24,589
It's in front of 21 Farragut.

229
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:28,752
And as you can see, this house here is a three story house.

230
00:20:28,912 --> 00:20:32,514
So the third story there is right at about pole level.

231
00:20:33,094 --> 00:20:39,418
So probably not the best location for us to make a move, but it was something that we would consider.

232
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:47,363
As we move further up the street, we come up to 33 Farragut and that's pole number 15, 16.

233
00:20:49,763 --> 00:20:53,825
This is a smaller pole, and the pole is more directly in front of the residence.

234
00:20:55,006 --> 00:20:59,288
When we can, we try to select a pole that's in between the residence.

235
00:21:00,049 --> 00:21:02,270
So this pole here, it may need replacing.

236
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:03,291
It may be usable.

237
00:21:03,311 --> 00:21:06,012
That would be up to the utility company to decide.

238
00:21:06,493 --> 00:21:14,217
But if this pole was usable, you'd see the antenna would be pretty much at height of the windows here on the second or third story, wherever that is.

239
00:21:17,711 --> 00:21:22,854
The next poll up is at 41 Farragut, and that's poll 1913.

240
00:21:23,614 --> 00:21:28,597
And as you can see here, here's our poll right here.

241
00:21:28,677 --> 00:21:33,119
And the poll gets heavily blocked by a tree going to the south.

242
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:38,962
And it's all the same, 24 feet or so from the home.

243
00:21:39,262 --> 00:21:41,983
It's a good poll, but again, we're losing signal there to that tree.

244
00:21:42,544 --> 00:21:46,806
And it's not much different, the distance from the home as the one on Sheridan Ave.

245
00:21:51,920 --> 00:22:05,664
Would that one be higher than the home or higher than the tree blockage if you put the antenna 33 feet or 34 feet up?

246
00:22:05,864 --> 00:22:11,566
The decision to trade the change of pole is going to be on the utility.

247
00:22:11,646 --> 00:22:13,626
We usually don't request pole replacements.

248
00:22:14,126 --> 00:22:19,628
And regardless, even if it goes up further here, that tree is definitely going to provide, it's going to have some blockage of the signal.

249
00:22:20,908 --> 00:22:23,010
It'll get better as the poll got higher, yes.

250
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,033
Thank you very much, Sean.

251
00:22:29,253 --> 00:22:29,553
Sure.

252
00:22:31,134 --> 00:22:34,336
So Ms.

253
00:22:34,356 --> 00:22:36,257
Kendall is here and she has her hand up.

254
00:22:36,437 --> 00:22:40,840
I'd like to hear from her and then we'll discuss as a committee.

255
00:22:42,581 --> 00:22:43,841
So Amanda, if we could unmute Ms.

256
00:22:43,861 --> 00:22:44,182
Kendall.

257
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:46,003
Thank you very much, Ms.

258
00:22:46,023 --> 00:22:46,203
Kendall.

259
00:22:46,223 --> 00:22:49,485
If you could limit yourself to two minutes.

260
00:22:51,077 --> 00:22:52,278
You have the floor.

261
00:22:52,298 --> 00:22:58,361
Okay, I know I my sister is trying to get into she's Marilyn Jordan so she'd like to talk after me if that's possible.

262
00:22:59,001 --> 00:23:09,326
Now we look at the one that this one on hookah street which is 23 hookah street is between hookah and grant grant and spring and my on the pictures that I gave you it's 001 is called 23 hookah street.

263
00:23:11,067 --> 00:23:17,128
That's on the sidewalk, there's a tremendous setback there.

264
00:23:18,228 --> 00:23:19,709
That would be an appropriate poll.

265
00:23:21,089 --> 00:23:25,510
There's one on 77 Sheridan Ave, that's down towards the end of the street.

266
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:29,171
And the one on 71 Central Ave overlap.

267
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:31,331
I can see it from my punch on porch.

268
00:23:31,511 --> 00:23:38,653
I don't see why we have to have the one on 71 Central, which is right there where 101 Sheridan is.

269
00:23:38,793 --> 00:23:40,153
And I think the ones on Farragut,

270
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:44,574
They replaced my pole, but they also destroyed my tree.

271
00:23:45,134 --> 00:23:50,596
So, I don't see that that would be a problem on the one on Farragut with cutting some of that tree back.

272
00:23:51,036 --> 00:23:59,279
It seems to me that I gave you 18, I gave you 18 sites, 98 Central Ave, Connor, 185 Sheridan and 24 Lambert, 197 Spring, which is 500 feet.

273
00:24:04,721 --> 00:24:06,542
197 spring, which is 500 feet.

274
00:24:07,103 --> 00:24:11,466
There are three on yeoman's app and on one on spring there by those citizens bank.

275
00:24:12,167 --> 00:24:15,429
There's one at 417 sound street 139 grant.

276
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:23,355
There's a one between 123 125 grant the I've got all the poll numbers listed on the thing that I gave you, there's one at 77.

277
00:24:25,777 --> 00:24:27,738
which is 380 feet from my house.

278
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:32,641
There's another one 8789 grant which is 311 feet from my house.

279
00:24:33,861 --> 00:24:41,685
So there seems to me that there could be a little more due diligence and the thing that's the big problem for the Sheridan neighborhood.

280
00:24:42,565 --> 00:24:45,887
is that the pole is just sitting there.

281
00:24:45,927 --> 00:24:47,227
There's no coverage whatsoever.

282
00:24:47,267 --> 00:24:48,748
There's not a leaf around it.

283
00:24:48,908 --> 00:24:55,171
There's nothing so that you don't see this pole from the top of Sheridan Ave to the bottom of Sheridan Ave.

284
00:24:55,431 --> 00:24:59,873
There needs to be some kind of camouflage so that you're not looking at this eye sore all the time.

285
00:24:59,933 --> 00:25:05,935
And the problem is, according to the tax records, my house is worth $600,000 right now.

286
00:25:06,256 --> 00:25:08,957
With that pole in front of it, with no camouflage whatsoever,

287
00:25:09,757 --> 00:25:12,098
I'll be lucky if I can get $300,000 for that house.

288
00:25:12,198 --> 00:25:17,439
So it's deflating the property values in that particular area.

289
00:25:17,479 --> 00:25:20,760
There seems to me to be a reason they could put them at the top of the street.

290
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,981
There's one at the top is Sheridan Ave.

291
00:25:23,301 --> 00:25:27,842
It's the top of Sheridan and Spring Street and it's 001.

292
00:25:28,242 --> 00:25:30,783
It's there with absolutely nothing on it.

293
00:25:31,544 --> 00:25:34,368
I'm sorry, 001 is the 23 Hooker Street one.

294
00:25:34,388 --> 00:25:35,209
There's nothing on that.

295
00:25:35,269 --> 00:25:43,181
And then the one on the top of Salem Street, there's a tree near it, but it's right at the top of the corner of Salem and Sheridan.

296
00:25:43,281 --> 00:25:44,783
It's pole number 4332.

297
00:25:46,185 --> 00:25:46,525
Okay.

298
00:25:47,026 --> 00:25:48,407
Yes, thank you very much, Miss Kendall.

299
00:25:48,787 --> 00:25:52,551
So I do have your list and I sent it to all the committee members.

300
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:54,092
I appreciate it.

301
00:25:54,272 --> 00:25:57,816
And I would like to just say a couple of things.

302
00:25:57,836 --> 00:26:07,124
We're going to have Verizon, I'm going to ask Verizon about the one at 23 Herker Street, I believe, on Mr. Conway's map, that was one of them that they looked at.

303
00:26:08,472 --> 00:26:10,973
wasn't able to, but we'll go and confirm that with them.

304
00:26:11,533 --> 00:26:23,876
And also too, the other thing I want to just remind you, and I believe Mr. Conaway should be able to speak to this too, is how the coverage works and what sort of the zone that they're looking at would be for coverage.

305
00:26:24,636 --> 00:26:26,136
So we can speak to that as well.

306
00:26:27,937 --> 00:26:36,399
But before that, the house value, and it's not really the purview of this committee, the value of homes and all, but I do know that there are,

307
00:26:38,022 --> 00:26:49,331
I'm not trying to rebut you or anything, but there are many, many, many people on the other side of this issue who believe that having an antenna near their home would actually increase the value of the home.

308
00:26:49,811 --> 00:26:51,453
So I think it depends on how you look at it.

309
00:26:52,994 --> 00:26:58,038
I have neighbors here where I live that want, they say, when's an antenna coming to my house?

310
00:26:58,478 --> 00:27:02,421
So I think that there's a lot of different opinions on that.

311
00:27:06,023 --> 00:27:09,265
I'm not sure it's a huge concern.

312
00:27:10,146 --> 00:27:14,789
With that said, I believe you said your sister, your cousin would like to speak.

313
00:27:14,969 --> 00:27:17,931
Mr. Marilyn Jordan, she doesn't seem to be able to get in.

314
00:27:17,991 --> 00:27:19,532
Can you unmute her in some way?

315
00:27:20,605 --> 00:27:22,306
We can unmute her, yes.

316
00:27:22,406 --> 00:27:24,706
If she is in the room, we can certainly unmute her.

317
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:30,468
I think if you look at the participants, it's Jordan, she was further down.

318
00:27:30,508 --> 00:27:31,549
Let me just look again.

319
00:27:31,569 --> 00:27:35,950
Yeah, we'll have Amanda look it up and see if we can find her.

320
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:37,611
She's doing that right now, so.

321
00:27:38,131 --> 00:27:39,191
I do see a Marilyn.

322
00:27:40,051 --> 00:27:40,351
Yeah.

323
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:44,513
Marilyn, can you hear us?

324
00:27:45,013 --> 00:27:46,113
I can, can you hear me?

325
00:27:46,133 --> 00:27:47,174
Yes, we can.

326
00:27:47,494 --> 00:27:47,894
Okay.

327
00:27:48,674 --> 00:27:54,195
All right, first, I just would like to say that I was the one who took all these photos.

328
00:27:55,035 --> 00:28:05,657
And this picture, and this happens to be poll number 1517 at 21 Farragut Ave, is way above the house.

329
00:28:07,158 --> 00:28:07,818
So there it is.

330
00:28:08,078 --> 00:28:11,078
I took these pictures and that's way above the house.

331
00:28:11,138 --> 00:28:14,719
I don't know what angle he took his at, but I took mine dead on.

332
00:28:16,733 --> 00:28:20,875
The same thing with pole number 1913, which is on Farragut Ave.

333
00:28:21,355 --> 00:28:23,075
It's quite a bit of ways from the tree.

334
00:28:23,916 --> 00:28:33,619
And if you wanna take a look at mine, 101 Sheridan Ave, I'm right next to a tree too, even though they chopped it and they cut down my other tree.

335
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:39,061
When it is in foliage, that's what it looks like right next to the tree.

336
00:28:40,121 --> 00:28:42,662
The pole is there, tree is there.

337
00:28:43,662 --> 00:28:45,303
So some of these excuses,

338
00:28:46,535 --> 00:28:54,338
And I'm calling them excuses is because I don't think Verizon, they've already counted their chickens before they hatch.

339
00:28:54,378 --> 00:28:59,140
They've already got the wire wrapped around my pole at 101 Sheridan Avenue ready to go.

340
00:29:00,181 --> 00:29:01,602
They just don't wanna move them.

341
00:29:01,842 --> 00:29:03,542
This is the other one on Farragut Ave.

342
00:29:03,562 --> 00:29:09,005
I don't know if you can see it in there, but there's my pole right there, right in his backyard.

343
00:29:09,385 --> 00:29:11,426
So this is only 230 feet away.

344
00:29:11,926 --> 00:29:14,747
So it's not gonna change any of his configuration.

345
00:29:14,787 --> 00:29:15,187
There's no,

346
00:29:18,267 --> 00:29:21,149
it's further away from their house than it is from mine.

347
00:29:21,629 --> 00:29:25,272
As I stated before- What number Farragut is that?

348
00:29:26,292 --> 00:29:28,854
I'm sorry, what number?

349
00:29:29,034 --> 00:29:33,016
I'm sorry, that's poll number 1516, 33 to 35 Farragut Ave, it's two family house.

350
00:29:33,997 --> 00:29:37,459
And as you can see, the poll is way, already way above that.

351
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:42,262
Now, yes, maybe these polls will have to be replaced, they're not new ones.

352
00:29:42,983 --> 00:29:46,605
In the packets I gave everybody, my sister gave everybody,

353
00:29:47,055 --> 00:29:48,776
I marked out what were the new ones.

354
00:29:49,616 --> 00:29:56,239
But the leaf cover is a diversion.

355
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:14,008
I spoke to several people from Verizon and several electricians who said that that 5G years ago, or maybe even less than a year ago, the technology has improved so much that

356
00:30:14,859 --> 00:30:16,460
you know, it's going through a tree.

357
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,181
Thank you.

358
00:30:17,661 --> 00:30:18,562
We have your point, Ms.

359
00:30:18,582 --> 00:30:18,842
Jordan.

360
00:30:18,862 --> 00:30:19,402
Thank you very much.

361
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:19,923
It was well-made.

362
00:30:22,584 --> 00:30:22,785
Okay.

363
00:30:22,945 --> 00:30:25,927
Thank you very much for that insightful commentary.

364
00:30:26,107 --> 00:30:26,707
Appreciate it, Ms.

365
00:30:26,727 --> 00:30:27,108
Kendall and Ms.

366
00:30:27,128 --> 00:30:27,388
Jordan.

367
00:30:28,649 --> 00:30:32,371
So, and I will say, I would like to thank Verizon.

368
00:30:32,952 --> 00:30:34,313
I appreciate you taking a second look at that.

369
00:30:36,094 --> 00:30:42,979
Just a couple of questions that came up there that I'd like addressed, please, is if you could go back to that graphic, I believe,

370
00:30:44,615 --> 00:30:50,577
One of the ones was Hooker Street, on Hooker Street, it was near 23 Hooker Street.

371
00:30:51,857 --> 00:30:52,638
You guys look at that one.

372
00:30:53,598 --> 00:30:54,158
Yeah, go ahead.

373
00:30:54,518 --> 00:30:57,239
Sorry, can I say, do you have the photos that were just referenced?

374
00:30:57,259 --> 00:30:59,220
Do you have sets of those for the official file?

375
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,040
I don't have photos of them.

376
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,701
The ones that, oh, I'm sorry.

377
00:31:02,941 --> 00:31:04,541
I don't have what Verizon showed me just now.

378
00:31:04,941 --> 00:31:07,222
I have what Ms.

379
00:31:07,262 --> 00:31:08,162
Kendall and Ms.

380
00:31:08,182 --> 00:31:09,243
Jordan sent me.

381
00:31:09,443 --> 00:31:09,863
I do, yeah.

382
00:31:10,189 --> 00:31:14,471
If we can also get Verizon's, if someone could just submit those so we have them for the record, that'd be great.

383
00:31:14,731 --> 00:31:16,552
It's a little harder over Zoom, so I didn't want to forget.

384
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:17,692
Yep.

385
00:31:17,712 --> 00:31:22,755
You guys can email those to me or the 5G comment email address and we'll get them.

386
00:31:23,095 --> 00:31:23,835
If you could please do that.

387
00:31:25,596 --> 00:31:25,836
Sure.

388
00:31:26,416 --> 00:31:27,157
Thank you.

389
00:31:28,797 --> 00:31:31,178
So we got to speak about the other poll that's on Hooker.

390
00:31:31,198 --> 00:31:33,540
It's kind of close to the corner here of Grant Ave.

391
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,661
And as mentioned, about three polls up,

392
00:31:37,027 --> 00:31:40,468
we have another node that's going there on Grand Dab, a plan to go there on Grand Dab.

393
00:31:40,488 --> 00:31:43,508
So those two poles would be very close to one another.

394
00:31:43,528 --> 00:31:49,670
And could you speak a little bit about the coverage area?

395
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:50,410
Because one of Ms.

396
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:56,431
Kendall's points was that if you expand this area, there are obviously more poles and more options.

397
00:31:57,371 --> 00:32:00,032
Can you just maybe speak just a little bit more?

398
00:32:00,052 --> 00:32:04,093
And I know you did already, but a little bit more about the coverage area and

399
00:32:05,366 --> 00:32:07,267
how you sort of land on this area?

400
00:32:09,368 --> 00:32:14,010
Certainly, and that not being my expertise, I'm going to hand it off to our RF engineer, Jason Flanagan.

401
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:15,030
Thank you.

402
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:20,972
Yeah, as you can see from the surrounding poles, we do not have a long distance of coverage area.

403
00:32:21,032 --> 00:32:21,773
We have two poles.

404
00:32:22,853 --> 00:32:26,154
We have a pole proposed on Otis Street and a pole proposed on Grand Ave.

405
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:32,312
Farragut Street and Sheridan Ave are both right in the middle.

406
00:32:32,432 --> 00:32:40,116
We can't go down to Central and we can't go up to Salem Street because those are just too far out of the way with the, do you have the deep cover?

407
00:32:40,136 --> 00:32:41,516
Okay.

408
00:32:44,197 --> 00:32:44,798
Thank you very much.

409
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:48,379
We'll go to discussion by the committee.

410
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:52,321
Yeah, Tim, I have a question for Verizon.

411
00:32:52,361 --> 00:32:55,583
I'm looking at that map and I looked at the pictures that

412
00:32:56,578 --> 00:33:05,305
as Kendall sent in to us, that pull at 23 Hooker Street seems to have a lot of clearance from any surrounding houses, much more than a 101 Sheridan.

413
00:33:05,325 --> 00:33:17,394
And it doesn't seem to be that it's moving too far for 101 Sheridan, so I don't really understand why you couldn't put it there and how it's gonna affect this coverage that you're talking about.

414
00:33:17,414 --> 00:33:19,135
Can you explain that a little bit better?

415
00:33:22,117 --> 00:33:26,020
It seems to me it's not moving that far away, so what's the difference if it's on you?

416
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:29,442
I don't want Sheridan or 23 Hooker.

417
00:33:29,602 --> 00:33:32,645
I can do my best to cover that.

418
00:33:33,005 --> 00:33:38,969
I showed the map, and if we go over to Grand Ave, we have another location we plan to use on Grand Ave.

419
00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:47,195
So that location at 23 Hooker Street or Hooker Ave is now about three poles away from another pole we're planning on using for a small cell.

420
00:33:49,543 --> 00:33:57,008
So the coverage now just overlapped and it's, you know, we miss a lot of the coverage that we wanna get back to Sheridan and Farragut.

421
00:33:58,128 --> 00:34:02,711
So what's the closest, if you were put on hooker, Sean, what's the closest it would be?

422
00:34:03,292 --> 00:34:06,374
What's the address of the closest poll there you were just mentioning?

423
00:34:06,394 --> 00:34:10,576
I think it was 23 Hooker.

424
00:34:10,596 --> 00:34:12,257
Correct.

425
00:34:12,538 --> 00:34:16,160
How close is your other proposed location to 23 Hooker?

426
00:34:17,561 --> 00:34:18,521
How close is it?

427
00:34:21,774 --> 00:34:27,237
maybe 200 feet, I'd have to pull up a different app so I can get the exact distance.

428
00:34:27,997 --> 00:34:28,358
Okay.

429
00:34:31,099 --> 00:34:38,003
Well, the reason I'm asking is, and I don't, this certainly isn't our expertise, but why would you need one at all?

430
00:34:38,103 --> 00:34:48,088
And if you have to pull that close together, are you saying it's that sensitive that you have to have one, one-on-one Sheridan in that other location adjacent to 23 Hookah for your coverage?

431
00:34:49,807 --> 00:34:50,027
Yes.

432
00:34:50,087 --> 00:34:52,828
Go ahead, Jason.

433
00:34:53,929 --> 00:34:54,849
Yeah.

434
00:34:55,849 --> 00:35:01,812
These frequencies are much different than the previous frequencies we used on a rooftop site and a larger scale site.

435
00:35:02,772 --> 00:35:10,015
These are about 10 times higher in frequency, which means basically the wavelength is 10 times smaller.

436
00:35:10,055 --> 00:35:17,998
Basically, if you think about it in terms of listening to a car drive by, you hear the bass notes first,

437
00:35:18,761 --> 00:35:22,204
And then you'll hear the singer later on as the car gets closer to you.

438
00:35:22,324 --> 00:35:24,626
So that's kind of the same thing here.

439
00:35:24,666 --> 00:35:27,048
The big sites that we have on the rooftops are the base notes.

440
00:35:27,588 --> 00:35:28,309
These are the singers.

441
00:35:28,369 --> 00:35:30,350
So you only hear them if they're very close.

442
00:35:30,551 --> 00:35:38,877
And any small object like a tree or a building or anything will stop the signal on its tracks and it won't go any further.

443
00:35:38,937 --> 00:35:47,164
So we've used these sites specifically to be very close to where the user is, very close to anywhere that's going to receive signal to provide that signal.

444
00:35:54,866 --> 00:35:55,506
Okay, thanks.

445
00:35:57,007 --> 00:35:59,749
What about the 41 to 43 Farragut?

446
00:35:59,989 --> 00:36:03,051
Is that the same issue?

447
00:36:08,975 --> 00:36:19,521
We had identified the three poles on Farragut as being usable poles as well, just that the conditions of the poles weren't much different than the one at Sheridan Ave.

448
00:36:20,462 --> 00:36:22,383
As to distance to residences,

449
00:36:26,302 --> 00:36:33,589
I have a question, and I'm wondering if this might be, because I realize there's some difficulties here, right?

450
00:36:33,629 --> 00:36:43,299
Like they can't just propose something on the fly tonight, a different poll, and we accept it because it would have to be properly noticed.

451
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:48,764
I am wondering if Verizon would be amenable

452
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:56,722
withdraw the 101 Sheridan tonight, rather than us voting on it and denying it, which I feel may be a high likelihood.

453
00:36:57,542 --> 00:37:00,604
Although I don't know, I know only how I would vote.

454
00:37:01,305 --> 00:37:04,987
And then it sounds that it might not be off.

455
00:37:05,688 --> 00:37:09,850
And then resubmitting proposal for a different location.

456
00:37:11,011 --> 00:37:17,115
And we would then hear the new location, it would be properly noticed.

457
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:19,631
one of the other acceptable polls.

458
00:37:20,191 --> 00:37:28,033
That would not make it impossible for them to then come back with one-to-one Sheridan if, in fact, there was similar problems.

459
00:37:28,053 --> 00:37:36,055
I think what I'm trying to do is to leave the doors open for them in a way that everybody could be amenable.

460
00:37:36,495 --> 00:37:38,836
It sounds like they may be willing to do Farragut.

461
00:37:39,176 --> 00:37:43,497
I obviously would never vote for one of those without having it properly noticed to the public.

462
00:37:46,856 --> 00:37:52,460
I think there might be a way here where you could, we could be working with each other on this location.

463
00:37:54,721 --> 00:37:59,464
I tend to agree with Alicia on this, and that's similar to what I was gonna propose.

464
00:37:59,484 --> 00:38:03,667
I mean, the exact same thing, basically, to try to resolve this particular issue.

465
00:38:05,929 --> 00:38:10,652
Yeah, we certainly couldn't move it anywhere else without public notice, so we wouldn't even consider that.

466
00:38:11,429 --> 00:38:11,629
Right.

467
00:38:11,669 --> 00:38:13,130
It would, it would be a withdraw.

468
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:21,834
It would be a, we would, you know, see if Verizon, um, would be open to withdrawing and resubmitting one of those other poll locations and, uh, moving forward like that.

469
00:38:23,155 --> 00:38:30,278
So, uh, Paul, um, do you have any, uh, strong feelings on this matter?

470
00:38:32,239 --> 00:38:32,539
Yeah.

471
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:36,961
Other than what I already stated, I, um, I think that's the right way to go.

472
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:37,922
We have to, uh,

473
00:38:38,507 --> 00:38:44,492
given an opportunity to withdraw this, because we certainly couldn't vote on a new location right now without going through the proper process.

474
00:38:45,552 --> 00:38:46,513
Yeah.

475
00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:47,394
Stan has his hand up.

476
00:38:48,475 --> 00:38:52,578
Yeah, just so that I'm clear, if we, you know,

477
00:38:54,089 --> 00:38:58,391
withdraw, of course, and then look at the three on Farragut.

478
00:38:59,251 --> 00:39:06,834
And those are deemed either by the power company or our engineers as being non-status.

479
00:39:07,414 --> 00:39:14,117
We would still be able to come back with what we've proposed tonight, correct?

480
00:39:16,278 --> 00:39:17,618
We wouldn't have control over that.

481
00:39:17,658 --> 00:39:21,320
I think, yeah, I mean, we would have to accept an application under the policy.

482
00:39:22,019 --> 00:39:24,661
But I think to Ms.

483
00:39:24,721 --> 00:39:33,229
Hunt's point, it would give us the opportunity to explore more deeply the Farragut sites.

484
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:44,878
And if those sites are, you know, for whatever reason, non-starters, we will come back with the application that we've presented to you tonight.

485
00:39:45,959 --> 00:39:47,621
That sounds like what I would expect, Stan.

486
00:39:47,661 --> 00:39:48,001
And I think,

487
00:39:49,233 --> 00:40:08,340
I think, too, it gives Verizon an opportunity to take a closer look, even at that Hooker Street pole, because if the reason is proximity to another proposed location, then there's an opportunity to potentially adjust the other potential location on Grant, whether it move it closer towards Salem Street or what have you.

488
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,842
So I think that opportunity then might exist as well for Verizon.

489
00:40:13,523 --> 00:40:19,898
With that said, I'd like to ask Verizon if, if they would like to take this opportunity to withdraw one on one Sheridan Avenue.

490
00:40:30,203 --> 00:40:38,366
Mr. Chairman, Tim Trudowski from Robinson and Cole, filling in for my colleague, Mike Jima, who due to a scheduling conflict was unable to be here this evening.

491
00:40:39,287 --> 00:40:58,795
Just to clarify a question for the chair, when you say Verizon would withdraw, I'm assuming what you mean withdraw without prejudice, such that if upon further analysis, it's determined that there are in fact no other viable alternatives, then we would be allowed to refile

492
00:40:59,689 --> 00:41:01,591
at the same location, one-on-one chair.

493
00:41:01,611 --> 00:41:02,772
Is that correct?

494
00:41:03,272 --> 00:41:05,214
That is my understanding and expectation.

495
00:41:05,234 --> 00:41:09,177
Okay.

496
00:41:09,197 --> 00:41:20,405
I feel that because this process may be new to some of the residents, Tim and I deal with a lot of boards that have proposals that get withdrawn and approved and et cetera.

497
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:25,689
If this poll was refiled,

498
00:41:27,017 --> 00:41:30,418
then there would be a full public notice for that location.

499
00:41:30,959 --> 00:41:31,899
And so Ms.

500
00:41:31,939 --> 00:41:32,699
Kendall and Ms.

501
00:41:32,819 --> 00:41:40,642
Jordan would absolutely be aware of that situation and that there was a new hearing.

502
00:41:41,863 --> 00:41:49,846
And I just wonder if anybody knows well enough to eyeball the distances that we're using on this.

503
00:41:50,306 --> 00:41:53,908
If one of those addresses on Farragut Street was filed,

504
00:41:55,307 --> 00:42:03,672
I think they would be within the notice radius, so they would actually be aware that that had been filed, is that correct?

505
00:42:04,473 --> 00:42:05,954
I know it's hard to say for sure.

506
00:42:07,975 --> 00:42:08,715
They'd be close.

507
00:42:09,176 --> 00:42:11,417
On Farragut Avenue, Alicia, I did eyeball it.

508
00:42:11,457 --> 00:42:17,241
I think at least 101 Sheridan would get a notification, yeah.

509
00:42:17,281 --> 00:42:23,345
So they would be fully aware whether one of those locations are being filed or 101 Sheridan was being filed.

510
00:42:25,138 --> 00:42:27,720
Yeah, I'll do a little bit better than an eyeball.

511
00:42:29,182 --> 00:42:30,062
I'll get this open here.

512
00:42:31,384 --> 00:42:38,150
I just don't want anybody to think that we would be trying to do this without a full awareness of all the affected parties here.

513
00:42:38,891 --> 00:42:49,240
Right, so the even side of Sheridan Avenue is approximately 200 feet away from Farragut Avenue.

514
00:42:50,657 --> 00:42:56,440
So add another 100 feet to that, and that's what the radius is for the notification.

515
00:42:58,981 --> 00:42:59,181
So.

516
00:43:00,221 --> 00:43:04,323
Kim, are you, have you, are you able to share Ms.

517
00:43:04,363 --> 00:43:05,404
Jordan and Ms.

518
00:43:05,424 --> 00:43:16,369
Kendall's proposals with Verizon, all the locations that they have shared with us for investigation?

519
00:43:17,629 --> 00:43:18,490
I think I can.

520
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:21,811
I would just double check that, but I, you know, I think so.

521
00:43:21,831 --> 00:43:22,551
Yeah, I think so.

522
00:43:22,791 --> 00:43:23,492
We received it today.

523
00:43:24,772 --> 00:43:25,372
So yes.

524
00:43:32,875 --> 00:43:33,135
All right.

525
00:43:35,156 --> 00:43:40,178
So Verizon, would you like us to move on this or would you like to withdraw?

526
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:52,393
Chairman Tim Trudovsky again from Robinson and call in consulting with my clients.

527
00:43:53,753 --> 00:44:03,199
I think our position at this point is given the length of time that we've had these applications in with with the city.

528
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:10,123
And we've shown extensive good faith in allowing the shot clock to be extended.

529
00:44:11,003 --> 00:44:14,205
Time and time again, we've done our due diligence prior to

530
00:44:15,221 --> 00:44:40,629
submitting the applications prior to this meeting again this evening, and we've explained to the board the reasons why this is the correct site for this particular location and why, despite, you know, other sites being pointed to us, pointed out to us as possible alternatives, we need to rely on our engineers and the RF specialists in making determination that this is in fact

531
00:44:42,504 --> 00:44:45,846
the only candidate that works for this particular site design.

532
00:44:45,906 --> 00:44:53,190
So at this point, we are not inclined to withdraw the application, but would ask that the board to go on the application.

533
00:44:54,491 --> 00:44:54,751
Thank you.

534
00:44:56,752 --> 00:45:05,958
All right, at this point, if there's no further discussion, then- I believe the policy states that we can deny based on aesthetics and neighbors' concerns.

535
00:45:06,158 --> 00:45:07,619
So I'm just putting that out there.

536
00:45:08,199 --> 00:45:08,660
Sure, yep.

537
00:45:11,765 --> 00:45:15,947
Residential concerns based off of the petition.

538
00:45:19,229 --> 00:45:30,496
And also there in the policy, part of that is a demonstration by the applicant that this location is superior from a community perspective to the other poles in the area.

539
00:45:32,297 --> 00:45:33,577
Based off the information that Ms.

540
00:45:33,597 --> 00:45:36,399
Kendall shared with me, I'm not confident that

541
00:45:37,992 --> 00:45:42,174
It is the superior location or it is superior from a community perspective.

542
00:45:45,356 --> 00:45:48,678
All but three dwellings basically signed that petition.

543
00:45:49,858 --> 00:45:50,719
That means a lot.

544
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:53,460
They oppose the installation.

545
00:45:54,321 --> 00:45:59,683
The resident at 101 Sheridan Ave has given this committee information on similar poles in the area that may be superior.

546
00:46:01,144 --> 00:46:04,386
So with that said, I await a motion from the committee.

547
00:46:05,352 --> 00:46:05,953
I make a motion.

548
00:46:05,973 --> 00:46:13,938
I'd actually like to just comment first that I also heard Verizon say that there were other polls that may be appropriate.

549
00:46:13,958 --> 00:46:17,040
Correct, same reason I'm not confident.

550
00:46:17,281 --> 00:46:20,563
All right, Paul.

551
00:46:21,804 --> 00:46:28,609
Mr. Chairman, for the record, you've cited two concerns raised by your butters with regard to this location.

552
00:46:28,849 --> 00:46:31,571
Can you specify what exactly those concerns are?

553
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:38,281
The concerns are aesthetic concerns as well as proximity to their home.

554
00:46:39,742 --> 00:46:40,202
Okay.

555
00:46:40,403 --> 00:46:50,209
And specifically from an aesthetic standpoint, to the extent that this design is essentially the same as every other design before the committee previously in this evening.

556
00:46:50,909 --> 00:47:01,836
And from a distance separation standpoint, it's similar to many of the sites that have already been approved and to virtually all of the other locations that we looked at and discussed this evening.

557
00:47:03,047 --> 00:47:16,414
I guess I'm looking for some differentiation between this particular site and the other sites that members of the public and members of this committee seem to have a, be of a thinking that are superior to the site.

558
00:47:18,195 --> 00:47:19,976
That's reflected by the record.

559
00:47:20,596 --> 00:47:21,517
Thank you for your comments.

560
00:47:23,037 --> 00:47:31,121
So my understanding, the community is the Sheridan Ave community, and they're concerned with the,

561
00:47:32,642 --> 00:47:40,404
with the location, the aesthetics, and they have a petition that says they don't want the antenna there.

562
00:47:41,365 --> 00:47:49,287
And the policy does state that the applicant must demonstrate that it's the superior location.

563
00:47:50,848 --> 00:47:55,569
So the differentiation is the residential concerns of the community.

564
00:47:56,758 --> 00:48:05,043
And I think also the differentiation in this particular site is they gave us some specific alternative locations that were discussed earlier tonight.

565
00:48:05,744 --> 00:48:14,109
And some of those alternative locations and what I've done my research on seem to be much more open spaces and there's further setbacks from the dwellings.

566
00:48:15,069 --> 00:48:21,994
So I think that's in my mind, a big different orientation that what this neighborhood is doing with their particular site.

567
00:48:23,935 --> 00:48:25,456
Of the ones that we approved,

568
00:48:26,903 --> 00:48:51,628
I would have to go back and be 100% certain, but this is the only one that I saw that was about eight to 10 feet from an open sitting front porch, that the others were a little further from the houses and were not or didn't have seating locations right in the front yard of the house like that.

569
00:48:55,275 --> 00:49:11,350
I would also agree with that, with Paul's opinion that other locations have been put forth by not only the residents, but actually Verizon has also said that there are potentially other locations that would be suitable.

570
00:49:11,450 --> 00:49:17,255
So this does not fit the definition of a superior location.

571
00:49:21,712 --> 00:49:22,492
All right, thank you everybody.

572
00:49:23,053 --> 00:49:26,235
I'd like to entertain a motion and continue with the agenda.

573
00:49:27,275 --> 00:49:30,957
I'll make a motion to deny the application for 101 Sheridan Avenue.

574
00:49:31,037 --> 00:49:33,199
Do we have a second?

575
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,022
Second.

576
00:49:39,382 --> 00:49:50,489
Tim, can I just suggest, because there's been a lot of comment from board members that you just summarized as part of the motion for the written record, the reasons for the denial so that it's a board,

577
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:53,942
decision and not individual comments.

578
00:49:54,322 --> 00:49:54,582
Sure.

579
00:49:55,643 --> 00:50:05,229
Um, so the motion would be to deny based on the following and just to make sure that everything's captured for purposes of writing up a decision.

580
00:50:05,709 --> 00:50:05,909
Yes.

581
00:50:05,949 --> 00:50:06,249
Thank you.

582
00:50:13,494 --> 00:50:18,537
If you want, I can, I can say what I have in my notes and then if I'm missing anything, you guys can add to it.

583
00:50:21,135 --> 00:50:33,802
So item 2J in the policy, description as to why the desired location is superior to other similar locations from a community perspective, including visual aspects and proximity to residential dwellings, schools, parks or playgrounds.

584
00:50:35,623 --> 00:50:45,648
And then I believe if we need to repeat, we can Robin, but if you didn't catch the reasons from the committee members.

585
00:50:47,623 --> 00:50:49,004
So I would include in the mode.

586
00:50:49,024 --> 00:50:49,844
This is what I've heard.

587
00:50:49,884 --> 00:50:54,065
And if I'm missing anything, you can let me know, but I would include in the motions for the reasons for the denial.

588
00:50:54,665 --> 00:51:09,350
And what I heard was that in addition to failing to meet to Jay, which requires that you demonstrate superior proximity for the reasons set forth there in the policy allows you to deny off residential and aesthetic concerns.

589
00:51:10,035 --> 00:51:12,956
This pole is very close to an open front porch.

590
00:51:13,977 --> 00:51:16,398
The neighbors have suggested other suitable locations.

591
00:51:16,478 --> 00:51:22,781
Verizon has indicated those locations may be suitable, at least three other poles on, I believe, Farragut Avenue.

592
00:51:24,802 --> 00:51:29,904
All of those three locations are more open up greater setbacks from the houses than this particular location.

593
00:51:29,924 --> 00:51:33,426
And that's what I have.

594
00:51:33,506 --> 00:51:36,207
If I'm missing anything, please add to it.

595
00:51:38,248 --> 00:51:42,091
I think the only other one was the, did you catch the petition?

596
00:51:42,491 --> 00:51:48,496
They all basically all but three houses in within 200 feet of the pole signed the petition to oppose it.

597
00:51:49,236 --> 00:51:53,139
So that demonstrates the residential concerns aspect of this.

598
00:51:54,980 --> 00:52:04,067
Robin, is it appropriate for the, to also let the record reflect that we've offered them the opportunity to withdraw without prejudice rather than being denied?

599
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:07,981
You certainly could add that.

600
00:52:08,021 --> 00:52:12,084
Such that they could refile upon further research.

601
00:52:12,124 --> 00:52:14,466
They could resubmit this one that we've offered that.

602
00:52:15,327 --> 00:52:25,054
You can also add that you offer rising the opportunity to study the other three locations that they indicated might be suitable alternatives and that they declined the opportunity.

603
00:52:25,074 --> 00:52:32,059
I agree.

604
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:33,180
We can wrap that all in motion.

605
00:52:36,182 --> 00:52:39,463
or you can say you can just deny it for those stated reasons would be the motion.

606
00:52:41,564 --> 00:52:42,744
And it was Paul's motion.

607
00:52:42,845 --> 00:52:50,487
So Paul, if you want to comment on whether that is a good summary of your motion.

608
00:52:50,507 --> 00:52:52,528
Yeah, I think it is.

609
00:52:52,568 --> 00:52:57,170
I think that captures everything that we had discussed in relation to this site.

610
00:52:59,011 --> 00:52:59,331
Thank you.

611
00:53:00,611 --> 00:53:01,572
Who is the second on that again?

612
00:53:03,152 --> 00:53:03,992
Alicia, is that you?

613
00:53:04,012 --> 00:53:05,053
Yeah, I think so.

614
00:53:05,818 --> 00:53:07,059
Okay, we'll do the roll call.

615
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:09,881
I'm just gonna mix up the order.

616
00:53:10,282 --> 00:53:12,704
I did the same order of you guys last meeting.

617
00:53:12,744 --> 00:53:15,186
I'm gonna switch it up this time just to keep it fresh.

618
00:53:15,706 --> 00:53:16,467
Marian O'Connor.

619
00:53:20,390 --> 00:53:22,251
So a yes vote.

620
00:53:22,311 --> 00:53:24,473
A yes to deny or a no to deny.

621
00:53:25,034 --> 00:53:26,535
Correct, yes, a yes, a yes.

622
00:53:26,575 --> 00:53:28,997
A yes to deny, a yes on the motion, yes.

623
00:53:29,037 --> 00:53:29,937
Exactly, the motion is.

624
00:53:30,058 --> 00:53:31,599
Got it.

625
00:53:34,202 --> 00:53:34,822
So is it a yes?

626
00:53:35,082 --> 00:53:36,663
May I make a comment?

627
00:53:36,703 --> 00:53:37,983
I'm sorry to interrupt.

628
00:53:40,364 --> 00:53:41,665
You may make a comment, yeah.

629
00:53:42,625 --> 00:53:44,646
Thank you, and I apologize for interrupting.

630
00:53:44,666 --> 00:53:54,869
I just want to state for the record, I believe one of the committee members indicated that this particular pole is within about 18 feet from a front porch.

631
00:53:55,749 --> 00:54:03,172
Our measurements indicate that this particular pole is located 28 feet from that house, which is more distant than

632
00:54:03,950 --> 00:54:07,432
at least one other poll that was approved by this committee last week.

633
00:54:07,833 --> 00:54:13,136
I'm told Medford number one or 001 is closer to the house.

634
00:54:14,296 --> 00:54:31,227
And also for the record, I do want to reiterate that Mr. Conway did address the three polls on Farragut and concluded that they were not superior to this particular location by way of addressing the

635
00:54:32,069 --> 00:54:40,051
other application that was approved that's closer than this particular one, I mentioned application number 0001, the street address is 50 George.

636
00:54:41,411 --> 00:54:41,651
Thank you.

637
00:54:41,731 --> 00:54:42,051
Thank you.

638
00:54:45,912 --> 00:54:51,193
Marianne, I didn't catch your yes or no.

639
00:54:52,573 --> 00:54:53,973
On the motion to deny, yes.

640
00:54:55,034 --> 00:54:55,434
Alicia Hunt?

641
00:54:56,734 --> 00:54:57,054
Yes.

642
00:54:58,054 --> 00:54:58,554
Paul Mulkey?

643
00:54:59,335 --> 00:54:59,535
Yes.

644
00:55:02,117 --> 00:55:02,377
Okay.

645
00:55:04,499 --> 00:55:09,843
Robin 50 George does not have an open front porch, which is what I was saying.

646
00:55:16,449 --> 00:55:29,399
Okay.

647
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:30,180
Okay.

648
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:35,828
Next on the agenda, back to, do we need a vote to go back to regular order?

649
00:55:37,409 --> 00:55:37,649
Robin?

650
00:55:39,491 --> 00:55:40,692
No, I think you can just proceed.

651
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:43,074
Okay, all right.

652
00:55:43,094 --> 00:55:46,897
So next is application 14-281 Boston Avenue.

653
00:55:46,917 --> 00:55:48,978
Amanda, if you could pull that up on the map.

654
00:55:53,302 --> 00:55:55,684
Amanda, are you good with the map or did you want me to do it?

655
00:56:02,290 --> 00:56:05,371
We've got to back up with Alicia, if we need it.

656
00:56:11,314 --> 00:56:17,817
So while she's pulling it up, my measurements on this was a while ago, but it's poll number 2677.

657
00:56:18,877 --> 00:56:20,478
There is a double poll there right now.

658
00:56:20,498 --> 00:56:26,501
And when we get to it, I'll ask to confirm that the double poll is in transition.

659
00:56:30,271 --> 00:56:35,494
It's within 70 feet of a three-story dwelling, one-story strip mall building below.

660
00:56:46,179 --> 00:56:48,920
Dave, could you see if there are any specific comments on this one?

661
00:56:49,181 --> 00:56:52,882
And if folks have site-specific comments on this, please put their hand up.

662
00:56:53,323 --> 00:56:57,285
It's 281 Boston Ave, application 14, home number 2677.

663
00:56:59,638 --> 00:57:02,699
No emails have been received for 281 Boston Avenue Street.

664
00:57:02,739 --> 00:57:03,079
Thank you.

665
00:57:19,263 --> 00:57:25,965
All right, I feel like typically when you can, can you look up individual poll numbers on this map?

666
00:57:28,207 --> 00:57:31,148
I think that was some trouble that Alicia was having last time, too.

667
00:57:32,188 --> 00:57:43,152
On this map, I was able to click, I think, where you're clicking, and so I have a search thing next to it, right next to where it says proposal.

668
00:57:44,353 --> 00:57:48,074
Between that and the X, I have a magnifying glass, and I was able to search.

669
00:57:48,514 --> 00:57:50,315
Try clicking on open in my maps, too.

670
00:57:50,575 --> 00:57:52,015
I find that might be helpful.

671
00:57:56,397 --> 00:57:56,897
There you go.

672
00:57:57,659 --> 00:58:02,662
Now you can type in either the full number or the street address.

673
00:58:02,722 --> 00:58:03,823
There it is right there, Amanda.

674
00:58:03,843 --> 00:58:04,483
The third one down.

675
00:58:04,503 --> 00:58:06,545
Thank you.

676
00:58:07,325 --> 00:58:07,886
You're welcome.

677
00:58:08,246 --> 00:58:08,626
Thank you.

678
00:58:09,627 --> 00:58:10,667
I appreciate your patience too.

679
00:58:10,867 --> 00:58:11,668
That can be nerve wracking.

680
00:58:13,969 --> 00:58:15,270
Maybe on the inside you weren't so patient.

681
00:58:15,370 --> 00:58:16,511
I don't know.

682
00:58:16,531 --> 00:58:17,612
That anxiety can build up there.

683
00:58:17,772 --> 00:58:22,575
All right.

684
00:58:22,635 --> 00:58:25,877
So if you're able to just zoom in a little bit closer to that,

685
00:58:27,371 --> 00:58:31,634
So there's a, I know I'm familiar with this corner.

686
00:58:31,995 --> 00:58:34,197
I'm not sure what the other committee members are.

687
00:58:35,578 --> 00:58:41,382
So any, so what I'll, I don't see any hands up.

688
00:58:41,843 --> 00:58:43,564
Amanda or Dave, do you guys see any hands up?

689
00:58:46,647 --> 00:58:46,867
Okay.

690
00:58:47,968 --> 00:58:48,448
All right.

691
00:58:49,569 --> 00:58:53,872
Committee members, do we have any discussion on this one?

692
00:58:55,914 --> 00:58:56,995
Before I ask about the double pool.

693
00:58:58,192 --> 00:59:01,193
I'll just comment that it appears to me they're putting in a new poll.

694
00:59:01,253 --> 00:59:06,334
The application indicates that a new poll is necessary to go higher.

695
00:59:06,354 --> 00:59:06,414
Yep.

696
00:59:08,174 --> 00:59:10,195
And I think that's what I see in this photo.

697
00:59:13,095 --> 00:59:22,097
And if I could have Verizon confirm that this poll is in transition and that it's not meant to be a double poll there.

698
00:59:22,117 --> 00:59:25,698
Okay, yep.

699
00:59:28,310 --> 00:59:30,311
in the progress and the double wall will be removed.

700
00:59:30,331 --> 00:59:31,672
Okay, thank you.

701
00:59:34,073 --> 00:59:38,515
All right, there's any further discussion or a way to motion?

702
00:59:38,535 --> 00:59:43,617
The residential apartments on top of the others all commercial.

703
00:59:45,118 --> 00:59:45,718
One story.

704
00:59:45,738 --> 00:59:47,119
One story building Marion.

705
00:59:47,579 --> 00:59:48,480
All commercial then.

706
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:50,621
Yeah.

707
00:59:50,721 --> 00:59:55,143
And the tennis, it's significantly higher than the building.

708
00:59:59,257 --> 01:00:00,118
month to approve.

709
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:01,899
Do we hear a second?

710
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:03,260
Second.

711
01:00:05,902 --> 01:00:07,423
All right, Alicia Hunt.

712
01:00:07,483 --> 01:00:10,545
Excuse me, Tim, that's just subject to the 12 standard conditions?

713
01:00:11,185 --> 01:00:11,405
Yes.

714
01:00:12,006 --> 01:00:12,786
Thank you, Robin.

715
01:00:13,327 --> 01:00:18,490
And moving forward, any motion to grant with conditions?

716
01:00:18,931 --> 01:00:22,793
And please, committee members, say grant with conditions, and then it'll be our general conditions.

717
01:00:24,274 --> 01:00:28,177
Yeah, you can just say with the 12 standard conditions, but we should do it for each.

718
01:00:29,023 --> 01:00:29,743
Each one, yeah.

719
01:00:30,444 --> 01:00:32,085
Thank you.

720
01:00:33,525 --> 01:00:35,727
So that is confirmed.

721
01:00:35,747 --> 01:00:36,567
That's the motion, Paul?

722
01:00:37,728 --> 01:00:39,208
That was Alicia's motion, Tim.

723
01:00:39,609 --> 01:00:40,069
Oh, I'm sorry.

724
01:00:40,129 --> 01:00:41,470
Alicia, can you confirm that's the motion?

725
01:00:42,190 --> 01:00:45,512
Yes, motion to approve with our 12 standard conditions.

726
01:00:46,072 --> 01:00:47,032
OK, second by Paul.

727
01:00:47,933 --> 01:00:48,293
Second.

728
01:00:48,433 --> 01:00:48,573
OK.

729
01:00:49,974 --> 01:00:51,995
Mary Ann O'Connor, vote?

730
01:00:52,015 --> 01:00:52,175
Yes.

731
01:00:53,676 --> 01:00:54,096
Alicia Hunt?

732
01:00:54,877 --> 01:00:55,137
Yes.

733
01:00:56,097 --> 01:00:56,557
Paul Mulkey?

734
01:00:57,298 --> 01:00:57,478
Yes.

735
01:00:58,250 --> 01:00:59,111
Tim McGibbon, yes.

736
01:00:59,131 --> 01:01:14,421
All right, next one is application number 17, 204 Winthrop Street, poll number 4182.

737
01:01:14,741 --> 01:01:16,382
This one's also a double poll.

738
01:01:17,423 --> 01:01:20,665
So again, I'll just ask to confirm that it's in transition.

739
01:01:22,246 --> 01:01:24,968
This one, however, it does not meet ADA clearance.

740
01:01:27,380 --> 01:01:32,683
The measurement from the pole to the back of the sidewalk is only 29 inches.

741
01:01:34,724 --> 01:01:39,687
So that's a problem that doesn't meet ADA requirements for passing.

742
01:01:43,177 --> 01:01:49,319
And the third story of a three-story dwelling is within 30 feet of the antenna, as you can see in the image here.

743
01:01:49,999 --> 01:01:53,600
So in my mind, the biggest issue on this one is the ADA clearance.

744
01:01:54,340 --> 01:01:57,501
So our policy is pretty clear that they have to meet ADA clearance requirements.

745
01:02:02,743 --> 01:02:06,084
And again, 36 inches is what you're looking for for a passage.

746
01:02:07,593 --> 01:02:12,615
on any stationary objects such as a mailbox pole, anything like that.

747
01:02:12,915 --> 01:02:15,356
The minimum is 36 inches for pedestrians.

748
01:02:15,416 --> 01:02:18,076
Amanda, are you able to show the street view easily?

749
01:02:18,096 --> 01:02:19,337
Because I just pulled that up.

750
01:02:19,477 --> 01:02:24,518
And when I look at the street view, it's like a foot and a half.

751
01:02:25,979 --> 01:02:26,899
It's so narrow.

752
01:02:27,819 --> 01:02:30,780
Well, there is debris on the ground.

753
01:02:31,421 --> 01:02:32,461
So there are leaves and bushes.

754
01:02:33,801 --> 01:02:35,702
My measurement was from the back of the sidewalk.

755
01:02:36,794 --> 01:02:38,735
to the pole, so I had to move debris.

756
01:02:39,975 --> 01:02:41,355
How many inches did you measure?

757
01:02:42,256 --> 01:02:43,296
I measured 29 inches.

758
01:02:43,896 --> 01:02:45,497
From the end of the sidewalk to the pole.

759
01:02:46,177 --> 01:02:48,118
Back of sidewalk to the pole, correct.

760
01:03:03,323 --> 01:03:04,763
I have a lot of concern about it.

761
01:03:05,232 --> 01:03:11,473
where institutionalizing, they add another system, a pole that does not allow clearance.

762
01:03:11,513 --> 01:03:18,415
And this is not just any pole, but this sidewalk is leading right across the bridge to our parks and stuff.

763
01:03:18,635 --> 01:03:21,455
And this is very dangerous.

764
01:03:21,835 --> 01:03:24,936
I put motion to deny based that it doesn't meet ADA clearance.

765
01:03:25,656 --> 01:03:29,117
Do you want to, excuse me, maybe just comment.

766
01:03:29,217 --> 01:03:31,157
I don't know if perhaps they have a plan for addressing that.

767
01:03:33,355 --> 01:03:42,339
Yeah, I think before we motion here, Marianne, what I'd like to do is just read item 4C in our policy.

768
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:52,744
Prohibitions, no small cell wireless installation shall be installed on poles that do not meet sidewalk clearance requirements and standards.

769
01:03:53,344 --> 01:03:56,425
This includes horizontal and vertical clearances for pedestrian passage.

770
01:03:56,985 --> 01:04:00,767
Applicable requirements and standards may include but are not limited to ADA and MUTCD.

771
01:04:01,780 --> 01:04:03,761
And the sidewalk is pretty narrow in this location.

772
01:04:03,781 --> 01:04:08,584
I'm not sure how it can be addressed without changing the location of the poles.

773
01:04:10,805 --> 01:04:12,726
Anyway, I will allow Verizon to comment on this.

774
01:04:16,407 --> 01:04:17,468
So Verizon can, go ahead.

775
01:04:31,820 --> 01:04:32,661
Anyone from Verizon?

776
01:04:38,726 --> 01:04:39,827
Tim, if I could.

777
01:04:40,707 --> 01:04:42,028
Yes, please.

778
01:04:42,809 --> 01:04:58,041
Is there any way of gaining additional sidewalk on the other side without moving the pole and increasing the sidewalk with itself physically, still being in the right of way?

779
01:05:01,388 --> 01:05:04,209
If you go back a sidewalk, you end up on private property.

780
01:05:04,309 --> 01:05:09,030
And if you go into street, then you end up in travel way and shoulder.

781
01:05:09,250 --> 01:05:10,911
So not really.

782
01:05:12,251 --> 01:05:23,915
So the sidewalk limitation marks the edge in the total public way there?

783
01:05:24,999 --> 01:05:26,260
Are we certain of that?

784
01:05:27,201 --> 01:05:36,946
Usually, yeah, excuse me, most properties in Medford, that's the transition, the edge of the sidewalk is the transition from going to private property to the public right away.

785
01:05:37,286 --> 01:05:39,728
So I would say that's probably the same case here.

786
01:05:40,788 --> 01:05:42,069
Yeah, it's pretty typical citywide.

787
01:05:42,529 --> 01:05:44,651
Okay, thank you, just asking.

788
01:05:45,431 --> 01:05:45,691
Thank you.

789
01:05:45,711 --> 01:05:48,513
Okay.

790
01:05:50,731 --> 01:05:58,437
So Marianne, for the purposes of your motion, the specific item in the policy is 4B, the one that I read.

791
01:05:58,457 --> 01:06:06,944
Do you need me to restate the motion?

792
01:06:07,825 --> 01:06:12,949
You can just confirm, clarify that that's- In accordance with 4B of our policy, yes.

793
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:17,953
Motion to deny based on- Robin, is that clear enough for the motion?

794
01:06:20,566 --> 01:06:21,807
not compliance with ADA.

795
01:06:22,447 --> 01:06:22,627
Yep.

796
01:06:24,528 --> 01:06:24,788
All right.

797
01:06:27,630 --> 01:06:28,010
Second.

798
01:06:30,712 --> 01:06:31,032
Alicia?

799
01:06:31,052 --> 01:06:32,473
Second.

800
01:06:33,293 --> 01:06:33,854
Second, okay.

801
01:06:34,854 --> 01:06:36,755
And I'll take a roll call vote.

802
01:06:38,116 --> 01:06:38,557
Paul Mulkey?

803
01:06:39,537 --> 01:06:39,777
Yes.

804
01:06:41,398 --> 01:06:45,481
And just to be clear, everybody, yes would be to deny.

805
01:06:45,801 --> 01:06:47,021
So Mary Ann O'Connor?

806
01:06:47,922 --> 01:06:48,082
Yes.

807
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:50,860
Yes.

808
01:06:51,761 --> 01:06:52,941
Tim McGivern, yes.

809
01:06:54,782 --> 01:06:57,584
Moving on.

810
01:06:57,604 --> 01:07:02,566
24 Tesla Avenue, application number 50, poll number 3787.

811
01:07:02,606 --> 01:07:03,126
So there it is.

812
01:07:16,908 --> 01:07:23,730
So this one, those two buildings are 20 feet, give or take a few feet from this poll location.

813
01:07:26,431 --> 01:07:28,392
Dave, any emails?

814
01:07:31,392 --> 01:07:32,933
No emails on 24 Tesla Avenue.

815
01:07:32,953 --> 01:07:37,534
Okay, is there anybody in the public who would like to speak on 24 Tesla Avenue?

816
01:07:37,554 --> 01:07:43,936
Amanda, if you see anybody, let me know or Dave.

817
01:07:43,956 --> 01:07:46,037
I do not see anyone.

818
01:07:47,104 --> 01:07:47,244
Okay.

819
01:07:49,125 --> 01:07:50,846
Open it up to committee discussion and questions.

820
01:07:53,847 --> 01:07:59,710
The height of that pole, Tim, for the height of the antenna going on top of the pole, from the ground?

821
01:08:00,330 --> 01:08:01,750
Yeah, let me pull the end.

822
01:08:02,151 --> 01:08:14,576
From the plans, the top of the existing utility pole is 34 feet, six inches, and existing primary power, here is at 35 feet, six inches,

823
01:08:17,301 --> 01:08:19,181
That is the beginning of the antenna.

824
01:08:19,742 --> 01:08:20,002
Thank you.

825
01:08:24,863 --> 01:08:25,143
Thank you.

826
01:08:25,183 --> 01:08:32,604
I'm going to close that application.

827
01:08:34,185 --> 01:08:36,925
If there's no public comment.

828
01:08:38,006 --> 01:08:40,266
No public comment, no email.

829
01:08:41,527 --> 01:08:43,687
We can open it for a motion, whatever.

830
01:08:44,965 --> 01:08:48,887
Motion to approve with our 12 standard comments, conditions.

831
01:08:49,908 --> 01:08:50,168
Thank you.

832
01:08:51,288 --> 01:08:52,869
I know it feels like it's getting late already.

833
01:08:53,189 --> 01:08:53,790
Do I hear a second?

834
01:08:54,270 --> 01:08:54,670
Second.

835
01:08:55,791 --> 01:08:58,032
I'll take it for a roll call vote.

836
01:08:58,652 --> 01:09:00,793
I said I was gonna try to mix it up, but I'm too tired to do that.

837
01:09:00,813 --> 01:09:02,914
I'm just gonna go by the order of your faces on the screen.

838
01:09:03,334 --> 01:09:04,175
Maryann O'Connor.

839
01:09:04,935 --> 01:09:05,175
Yes.

840
01:09:06,396 --> 01:09:06,976
Alicia Hunt.

841
01:09:07,697 --> 01:09:07,937
Yes.

842
01:09:09,097 --> 01:09:09,618
Paul Mulkey.

843
01:09:10,438 --> 01:09:10,718
Yes.

844
01:09:11,619 --> 01:09:12,399
Tim McGibbon is a yes.

845
01:09:13,419 --> 01:09:13,700
Thank you.

846
01:09:14,584 --> 01:09:21,226
Next application is 42 Martin Street, application number 53, poll number 1132.

847
01:09:21,266 --> 01:09:32,710
So Dave, when you're ready, emails, and then if folks

848
01:09:33,596 --> 01:09:36,297
In the public wanting to comment, please raise your hand.

849
01:09:36,997 --> 01:09:45,281
My measurements are thus 25 feet from a two-story residential dwelling, 45 feet from the closest three-story dwelling, all in the horizontal plane.

850
01:09:46,661 --> 01:09:48,642
No emails on 42 Martin Street, Mr. Chair.

851
01:09:49,642 --> 01:09:49,903
Thank you.

852
01:09:51,603 --> 01:09:53,064
And do we see any hands up from the public?

853
01:09:55,285 --> 01:09:56,225
I see no hands.

854
01:09:56,745 --> 01:09:58,426
Okay, thank you.

855
01:09:58,466 --> 01:09:59,626
Discussion from the committee.

856
01:09:59,707 --> 01:10:00,727
If no discussion, motion.

857
01:10:08,665 --> 01:10:20,210
It appears this is a location that is getting a new pole where the proposed top of the utility pole will be 38 feet, six inches.

858
01:10:24,993 --> 01:10:25,353
Thank you.

859
01:10:28,795 --> 01:10:31,616
Motion to approve with our 12 standard conditions.

860
01:10:33,317 --> 01:10:35,838
Do we have a second?

861
01:10:35,858 --> 01:10:35,998
Second.

862
01:10:37,516 --> 01:10:38,137
Put it to a vote.

863
01:10:39,578 --> 01:10:41,099
The order's changing on my screen.

864
01:10:41,399 --> 01:10:42,239
Now Amanda's at the top.

865
01:10:42,660 --> 01:10:43,780
Alicia Hunt?

866
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:44,981
Yes.

867
01:10:46,162 --> 01:10:46,582
Paul Moki?

868
01:10:47,623 --> 01:10:47,883
Yes.

869
01:10:48,904 --> 01:10:49,544
Marian O'Connor?

870
01:10:50,144 --> 01:10:50,385
Yes.

871
01:10:51,225 --> 01:10:52,086
I'm yes as well.

872
01:10:54,487 --> 01:10:57,509
Next application is number, sorry?

873
01:10:57,910 --> 01:10:58,490
Sorry to interrupt.

874
01:10:58,530 --> 01:11:00,051
I had a little technical glitch there.

875
01:11:00,071 --> 01:11:01,492
Did you say that was with the conditions?

876
01:11:02,473 --> 01:11:02,753
Yes.

877
01:11:03,053 --> 01:11:03,413
Okay.

878
01:11:03,934 --> 01:11:04,334
Thank you.

879
01:11:04,354 --> 01:11:05,034
Sorry, I just missed it.

880
01:11:05,054 --> 01:11:05,715
I apologize.

881
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:07,541
Not a problem, not a problem.

882
01:11:09,142 --> 01:11:14,485
One of the reasons I'm at home is because the internet connection at City Hall glitches out every 15 minutes.

883
01:11:14,985 --> 01:11:18,667
So I'm wondering if Alicia, that's happening to Alicia, but anyway.

884
01:11:20,068 --> 01:11:21,469
Again, it's working tonight.

885
01:11:21,949 --> 01:11:22,350
Oh, good.

886
01:11:22,770 --> 01:11:23,751
Maybe they put boosters in.

887
01:11:24,011 --> 01:11:27,333
All right, the next application is number 5290 North Street.

888
01:11:29,354 --> 01:11:29,774
Poll number 2036.

889
01:11:35,878 --> 01:11:36,698
Any emails?

890
01:11:41,221 --> 01:11:43,502
There are no emails from 90 North Street.

891
01:11:45,203 --> 01:11:48,945
Okay, and anyone from the public here to comment?

892
01:11:51,046 --> 01:11:52,207
I see no hands.

893
01:11:53,167 --> 01:11:56,289
Okay, discussion from the committee.

894
01:11:59,951 --> 01:12:03,273
My measurements 20 feet away to residential

895
01:12:04,860 --> 01:12:07,922
third story buildings, as you can see, that's about 20 feet.

896
01:12:09,883 --> 01:12:13,926
The antenna seems to be going way above the roof line.

897
01:12:15,627 --> 01:12:26,435
It's the proposed, it's a new power, a new utility pole looks like from street view that that's what's in now at 38 feet, six inches.

898
01:12:29,877 --> 01:12:31,618
Way above the roof line on street view.

899
01:12:36,748 --> 01:12:40,831
make a motion to approve 90 North Street with standard conditions.

900
01:12:42,593 --> 01:12:43,213
I'll second.

901
01:12:43,773 --> 01:12:45,755
All right, thank you.

902
01:12:46,155 --> 01:12:47,096
Mary Ann O'Connor, vote?

903
01:12:48,377 --> 01:12:48,637
Yes.

904
01:12:49,738 --> 01:12:50,438
Alicia Hunt, vote?

905
01:12:51,259 --> 01:12:51,499
Yes.

906
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:52,800
Paul Mulkey?

907
01:12:53,441 --> 01:12:53,701
Yes.

908
01:12:55,042 --> 01:12:55,642
We give her a yes.

909
01:12:59,145 --> 01:13:01,587
104 College Avenue.

910
01:13:01,607 --> 01:13:02,948
104 College Avenue.

911
01:13:03,228 --> 01:13:04,169
Application number 10.

912
01:13:05,089 --> 01:13:05,650
Poll number

913
01:13:06,654 --> 01:13:13,920
1598.

914
01:13:06,694 --> 01:13:13,920
We do have a number of emails on this, Mr. Chairman.

915
01:13:15,201 --> 01:13:15,521
Okay.

916
01:13:17,343 --> 01:13:24,369
Do you want to read them if they're short or summarize them?

917
01:13:24,389 --> 01:13:28,232
I want to make sure that I'm looking at the right poll.

918
01:13:28,252 --> 01:13:29,053
Okay.

919
01:13:34,250 --> 01:13:34,870
I think that's right.

920
01:13:34,890 --> 01:13:35,971
I have it on street view.

921
01:13:36,011 --> 01:13:43,033
Do you want me to show it on street view for the... Yes, please.

922
01:13:43,154 --> 01:13:49,636
I have some notes on this too from some residents.

923
01:13:53,478 --> 01:13:59,460
I believe based on the no heavy trucking sign that this is the same one as in our packet.

924
01:14:02,246 --> 01:14:05,051
That looks, that looks right.

925
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:15,167
So maybe, maybe now you want to read the read the comments now.

926
01:14:19,489 --> 01:14:21,349
Dave, you wanna go through the emails?

927
01:14:21,850 --> 01:14:24,410
Yeah, so we received an email from John with no last name.

928
01:14:24,430 --> 01:14:32,132
His biggest concern is he lives at 94 College within the 300 feet of the proposed site.

929
01:14:32,292 --> 01:14:33,332
He has safety concerns.

930
01:14:34,373 --> 01:14:40,894
He is curious as to whether putting this tower at 100 College could in any way impact his health or property values.

931
01:14:41,434 --> 01:14:44,315
And if it needs to be disclosed before he sells this house.

932
01:14:45,490 --> 01:15:08,466
Received another email from Ryan C, which I believe was sent to several members of the committee, that they live directly across the street from the proposed site at 104, and they state that they do not consent to the installation of 5G equipment, strongly oppose this type of encroachment, eyesore safety and health risk, may request if necessary in order to be created to stop this from moving forward.

933
01:15:09,187 --> 01:15:13,770
They do outline a number of questions, thoughts, facts, and concerns.

934
01:15:16,563 --> 01:15:21,545
Regarding 5G, namely that it's faster, but with less battery life.

935
01:15:21,565 --> 01:15:23,066
It doesn't work on all phones.

936
01:15:23,586 --> 01:15:26,327
Phones operating and receiving the 5G signal are known to overheat.

937
01:15:27,288 --> 01:15:39,213
The device designed to specifically work with phones sent a signal that could basically quote unquote cook the phone until it malfunctions and ask the question why they would want to carry that phone in their pocket or hold it near his head.

938
01:15:40,574 --> 01:15:45,901
What can that do to us, an infant, wildlife, or children close by at the L.A.

939
01:15:45,921 --> 01:15:46,862
Pearson Daycare Center?

940
01:15:47,463 --> 01:15:52,208
The 5G antenna will be broadcasting extremely high frequency microwave signals 24 hours a day, every day.

941
01:15:52,889 --> 01:15:58,056
Long-term exposure to radiation can affect the skin, eyes, internal organs, and cause unusual brain and heart tumors.

942
01:15:59,717 --> 01:16:07,541
Asked the question, wouldn't more antennas eventually be needed and added for each 5G company, Sprint, Comcast, et cetera, which will turn to increased exposure levels?

943
01:16:08,221 --> 01:16:13,624
Many doctors and scientists know that 5G is unsafe and have formally cited the FCC to post more torium on 5G use.

944
01:16:14,224 --> 01:16:16,085
Why have some countries banned 5G?

945
01:16:16,605 --> 01:16:21,708
How could this be weaponized and used in a hostile way for data collection, information control, warfare, hackers, et cetera?

946
01:16:22,548 --> 01:16:33,033
It states that the US Department of Defense already has a weapon called the active denial system, which uses the same technology to make people's skin feel like it's stinging or burning.

947
01:16:33,053 --> 01:16:37,075
Turn up a notch, this weapon could microwave people to death.

948
01:16:37,955 --> 01:16:40,196
Ask the question, who is guaranteeing the safety of this?

949
01:16:40,676 --> 01:16:41,677
What is that guarantee?

950
01:16:43,039 --> 01:16:46,260
and asked the question, what plan of action will you take if this were to move forward?

951
01:16:46,580 --> 01:16:48,481
And if there are any adverse reaction to arrestment.

952
01:16:49,421 --> 01:16:54,082
States again that they are greatly concerned about the health issues and unforeseen complications that may arise from 5G.

953
01:16:54,582 --> 01:16:59,964
And again, reiterates their lack, they're stating that they do not consent to the equipment installation.

954
01:17:00,904 --> 01:17:08,466
That was signed by Christopher of 96 Stanley F. Said also on behalf of Christopher, the property owner of 94 Stanley F.

955
01:17:12,002 --> 01:17:21,195
And I will say that I received residents at 94 and 96 Stanley out of the Christopher's the same, the same folks object to the placement.

956
01:17:22,777 --> 01:17:27,203
So that sounds pretty clear that they object to it and they request a location further away.

957
01:17:27,603 --> 01:17:29,546
So it's all noted and take it into the record.

958
01:17:33,605 --> 01:17:36,908
And the other, it is across the street from the Elliott Pearson School.

959
01:17:38,569 --> 01:17:46,516
And Paul, I don't know if you know the answer to this question, but Paul Mulkey, did that use of that building change?

960
01:17:46,656 --> 01:17:50,339
Are you aware of, I believe it did, but I'm not quite sure.

961
01:17:50,979 --> 01:17:52,841
Yeah, I believe it did.

962
01:17:52,921 --> 01:18:01,268
And because of the restrictions we've had on COVID this past year, we were not able to go in there, do our annual inspections because it was a,

963
01:18:01,915 --> 01:18:09,659
was a school facility at the time, so I don't know exactly what's the latest classification of that building, but I'll find that out.

964
01:18:12,581 --> 01:18:14,562
The poll, and just a couple of notes for me.

965
01:18:15,402 --> 01:18:20,965
So the poll is in the Stanley Avenue right away, as opposed to the College Avenue right away.

966
01:18:20,985 --> 01:18:24,167
I think you can see that here in the photo here on the screen.

967
01:18:25,387 --> 01:18:25,868
And it's,

968
01:18:27,383 --> 01:18:31,006
within 18 feet of that house that you can see in the photo here as well.

969
01:18:32,267 --> 01:18:35,029
But as you can see, the pole is significantly higher than the home.

970
01:18:36,130 --> 01:18:36,310
So.

971
01:18:38,532 --> 01:18:39,833
Is that a double pole?

972
01:18:40,033 --> 01:18:44,217
I mean, according to that photo, but according to the plans, that other pole isn't there.

973
01:18:44,237 --> 01:18:54,625
I don't have it in my notes that it's a double pole, Marianne, which leads me to believe it may already be back to a single pole, but that doesn't mean I,

974
01:18:55,497 --> 01:19:00,299
You may have missed it, but this would be another one that we do have one of our standard conditions.

975
01:19:00,359 --> 01:19:05,321
It says, our policy says it, and our condition says it, that you can't put it on the double pole.

976
01:19:05,341 --> 01:19:12,445
You have to wait until the pole is a single pole before it can be placed on it, per the plan to as well.

977
01:19:14,465 --> 01:19:20,868
And I know, again, in this photo, it doesn't look as direct, but in the application photo, it looks to me like the pole is leaning.

978
01:19:20,888 --> 01:19:22,209
I don't know if that's,

979
01:19:22,905 --> 01:19:28,289
just the photo that was taken for the application, but the pole seems to be a little bit.

980
01:19:28,349 --> 01:19:32,392
Yeah, that's an angle to Miriam.

981
01:19:32,432 --> 01:19:34,614
So it does look like it's got a lead to it.

982
01:19:36,355 --> 01:19:40,318
My impression is that that's photo is of the old pole.

983
01:19:40,438 --> 01:19:50,406
That is the one that in the street view we see being removed because the new pole is 38 feet, six inches, which is what

984
01:19:51,005 --> 01:19:58,009
I feel like I'm seeing here is a very tall pole that's in the process of being installed.

985
01:19:59,530 --> 01:20:11,157
I guess my concern is while I do not understand why our policies say they should not be near schools, our policy says it should not be near school.

986
01:20:11,677 --> 01:20:19,722
And so just to make sure we have this clarification, is this directly across the street from a school or is it not?

987
01:20:20,853 --> 01:20:25,576
because I think the question is whether or not that building is currently a school.

988
01:20:26,157 --> 01:20:36,444
And I would think that it would be, regardless of COVID, any school that is closed because of COVID, I would anticipate will reopen.

989
01:20:36,464 --> 01:20:41,787
If it's closed because they're changing their use of their building, that's a permanent change.

990
01:20:43,348 --> 01:20:46,831
The Elliot Pearson is still operating during COVID, I can tell you that much.

991
01:20:48,432 --> 01:20:50,133
And that's pretty much right across from it.

992
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:58,963
I'm aware of it, but I've never visited.

993
01:20:59,003 --> 01:20:59,863
I didn't know where it was.

994
01:20:59,883 --> 01:21:03,345
Is that the Elliott Pearson School right there?

995
01:21:03,365 --> 01:21:07,687
Did we refer back to our policies?

996
01:21:07,767 --> 01:21:15,831
Again, I'm not clear why that's in our policies, but I don't write the policy.

997
01:21:17,171 --> 01:21:20,013
Well, there's also no setback number

998
01:21:21,128 --> 01:21:21,808
Yeah, right.

999
01:21:22,008 --> 01:21:23,629
So what does that mean?

1000
01:21:24,089 --> 01:21:28,391
There's no like it doesn't say like must be, you know, 100 feet away from a school.

1001
01:21:28,411 --> 01:21:30,111
It doesn't say that.

1002
01:21:46,713 --> 01:21:49,676
Where does it say that it can't be near a school?

1003
01:21:49,736 --> 01:21:54,260
For some reason, I thought that was like maybe in the FCC policy or something.

1004
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:55,381
I'm trying to find it.

1005
01:21:55,501 --> 01:21:57,363
It does mention it, it doesn't.

1006
01:21:57,883 --> 01:21:58,924
Yeah, I'm looking for it too.

1007
01:21:59,165 --> 01:22:09,134
The other day during our meeting, I looked a few times to try to figure out where it said about not being near parks or schools and because people kept mentioning it, but I couldn't find it in the document.

1008
01:22:15,208 --> 01:22:35,483
Um, if at least I don't want to jump in, but if it's helpful, I know J of the policy, I think it's one J talks about, um, talks about areas that the city might regulate, which include setbacks on dwellings, parks, playgrounds, or recreational areas.

1009
01:22:35,503 --> 01:22:40,726
But as I think it was previously discussed, those have not been put into place.

1010
01:22:40,786 --> 01:22:42,728
So I don't know if that's what folks are talking about.

1011
01:22:44,220 --> 01:22:46,880
So do you think that's the only, I see that.

1012
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:58,042
Description as to why the desired location is superior to other similar locations from a community perspective, including visual aspects and proximity to residential dwellings, schools, parks, or playgrounds.

1013
01:22:58,482 --> 01:23:09,444
So I guess the question for Verizon is to be explicit, did they consider that this is right across the street from a school as part of it?

1014
01:23:10,444 --> 01:23:13,325
I feel like that's what this is requiring, that they've taken that into

1015
01:23:13,816 --> 01:23:15,278
count in their placement.

1016
01:23:16,939 --> 01:23:17,540
But you're right.

1017
01:23:17,700 --> 01:23:24,768
If I was to rewrite this, I might add a specific... Might be more specific here.

1018
01:23:43,205 --> 01:23:52,269
Could Verizon speak to this specific location and why this spot on this pole and not further, some other, further up or down the street?

1019
01:23:53,129 --> 01:23:54,650
So Verizon, you can address that.

1020
01:23:54,870 --> 01:23:57,211
I'm just trying to find any reference in the policy.

1021
01:23:58,692 --> 01:24:01,353
Mr. Chairman, Tim Trudowski from Robinson and Cole.

1022
01:24:01,613 --> 01:24:05,955
I'll ask Sean perhaps to weigh in a little bit as well.

1023
01:24:06,035 --> 01:24:11,197
But I think in reading the policy as a committee member just did that,

1024
01:24:12,714 --> 01:24:27,523
It doesn't prohibit location in proximity to schools, but asks that we explain why it's a superior location from the community's perspective, including proximity to residential dwelling schools, parks and playgrounds.

1025
01:24:27,564 --> 01:24:34,008
So in that respect, it's not giving schools higher priority than residential

1026
01:24:34,617 --> 01:24:35,097
dwellings.

1027
01:24:35,637 --> 01:24:42,439
And in this case, it's obviously considerably closer to residential dwellings than it is from the school.

1028
01:24:42,559 --> 01:24:46,860
It's far more distant from and across the street from the school.

1029
01:24:47,980 --> 01:24:55,462
It also is located at an intersection, which, again, I'll defer to the RF and network

1030
01:24:56,693 --> 01:25:04,981
experts on the call to pick up on this, but I think from an RF perspective, it is superior to one that's not located at an intersection.

1031
01:25:07,664 --> 01:25:11,828
Thank you.

1032
01:25:11,868 --> 01:25:13,810
I can speak a little bit further as to the location.

1033
01:25:14,250 --> 01:25:20,857
As Tim had suggested there, the location is at the T intersection of the two streets.

1034
01:25:21,865 --> 01:25:23,246
uh, Stanley and college.

1035
01:25:23,747 --> 01:25:29,031
So the signal from the, the, the site can go up and down both streets equally.

1036
01:25:29,791 --> 01:25:39,639
Um, and then as we get down on the ground level, um, you know, the next poll that you can see right there is, um, is a three-way junction pole.

1037
01:25:39,679 --> 01:25:43,401
That's very close to the, uh, to the Stanley ab corner there.

1038
01:25:43,962 --> 01:25:46,964
There's probably about 15, 20 feet to the next ball.

1039
01:25:46,984 --> 01:25:47,144
Yeah.

1040
01:25:47,164 --> 01:25:48,125
So that poll there, there's,

1041
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:55,862
primary power running from the top of this pole to the Stanley Ave pole, and then primary power running up and down College Ave.

1042
01:25:56,262 --> 01:25:57,923
So it's called a three-way junction pole.

1043
01:25:58,303 --> 01:26:00,983
Those poles are not allowed to attach to.

1044
01:26:01,003 --> 01:26:17,468
If you had, I guess the way we're looking to the next pole up on College Ave, the next pole up is 1560 slash one, and that pole has a transformer on it.

1045
01:26:18,050 --> 01:26:19,832
So we're unable to use that poll.

1046
01:26:20,352 --> 01:26:26,898
And again, the target here was that intersection of Stanley and College so that the signal could travel up and down Stanley and College.

1047
01:26:31,002 --> 01:26:33,024
I think we're looking the other way.

1048
01:26:33,104 --> 01:26:33,204
Oh.

1049
01:26:34,225 --> 01:26:35,566
Yeah, I shot past it.

1050
01:26:35,586 --> 01:26:36,647
Sorry, I overshot.

1051
01:26:39,526 --> 01:26:49,869
And Alicia, Mr. Twardowski, his reference to item 2J was the other reference to parks and schools based off of the superior location.

1052
01:26:51,490 --> 01:26:55,571
So those are the two references, but neither one of them indicates setbacks.

1053
01:26:57,312 --> 01:26:59,012
So the actual numbers.

1054
01:26:59,032 --> 01:27:07,515
Sorry, go ahead.

1055
01:27:09,745 --> 01:27:09,905
Good.

1056
01:27:10,185 --> 01:27:13,547
I was gonna see if there's anyone from the public here to speak on this one.

1057
01:27:14,088 --> 01:27:15,849
Amanda, did we look at that already?

1058
01:27:15,869 --> 01:27:19,271
I have no hands up.

1059
01:27:19,831 --> 01:27:20,332
Okay, thank you.

1060
01:27:23,314 --> 01:27:36,342
Tim, just to, if I could take a second, address one of the comments that was read from the email about writing an ordinance to address setbacks and alleviate some of the other concerns that the neighbors have.

1061
01:27:37,151 --> 01:27:45,777
And maybe Robin can weigh in on this, but this committee does not have any authority to write either policy or ordinance.

1062
01:27:46,697 --> 01:27:59,685
And anything that would be written in the future does not apply to these applications because we have to do what we've been doing, which is go by the policy that's in place when these applications were submitted.

1063
01:28:00,266 --> 01:28:03,047
And Robin, did I misspeak on anything on that?

1064
01:28:03,107 --> 01:28:04,148
Or can you comment on that?

1065
01:28:04,990 --> 01:28:06,510
No, no, Paul, I think that was accurate.

1066
01:28:06,550 --> 01:28:11,732
I agree this committee just applies the policy that it has within the scope of the policy.

1067
01:28:11,872 --> 01:28:17,573
And yet again, changes in the future would not apply in my opinion to these applications.

1068
01:28:18,653 --> 01:28:23,835
At least to the consideration of granting the locations.

1069
01:28:25,015 --> 01:28:26,915
Okay, thanks.

1070
01:28:27,736 --> 01:28:33,657
One of the questions that was in the comments, Paul, I'm wondering if

1071
01:28:34,892 --> 01:28:42,594
you have the ability to answer is it says that I wonder, does this need to be disclosed should I sell my house?

1072
01:28:45,294 --> 01:28:56,597
This is not, I mean, my feeling is that no, but I don't know if there are things that need to be disclosed when one sells a house, if you would be aware of that as the building commissioner.

1073
01:28:57,317 --> 01:29:01,058
Well, from the city audience aspect of that,

1074
01:29:02,367 --> 01:29:28,706
codes or regulations, excuse me, there's no requirement to do that, that would be covered under real estate law, but I think just to go back up a second, I think Tim phrased it really well earlier when he made a comment on that, there's a lot of experience on that, some people feel it's gonna devalue the cost of the house, other people think it's gonna enhance it, but as far as the city audits regulations, we don't have any requirements for that.

1075
01:29:35,389 --> 01:29:39,871
Okay, any more discussion or floor is open for discussion or motion?

1076
01:29:41,971 --> 01:29:47,453
I feel the height of the antenna is way above the roof lines again.

1077
01:29:50,454 --> 01:29:53,675
Yeah, I don't see that we have any real reason to deny it.

1078
01:29:53,795 --> 01:30:02,298
I understand that the abutters are opposed to this location, but the reasons that they've given are not ones that are within our jurisdiction to deny.

1079
01:30:06,173 --> 01:30:08,435
At least, I don't know if anybody feels differently, but.

1080
01:30:08,996 --> 01:30:09,516
I feel the same.

1081
01:30:10,377 --> 01:30:11,879
Yeah, I think you're right, Alicia.

1082
01:30:11,899 --> 01:30:16,403
All right, motion to approve with our standard 12 conditions.

1083
01:30:17,724 --> 01:30:18,245
Do we have a second?

1084
01:30:18,325 --> 01:30:18,585
I second it.

1085
01:30:18,605 --> 01:30:21,348
All right, going down my images here.

1086
01:30:21,468 --> 01:30:22,369
Paul Moki, vote?

1087
01:30:22,729 --> 01:30:22,969
Yes.

1088
01:30:24,110 --> 01:30:24,571
Alicia Hunt?

1089
01:30:25,412 --> 01:30:25,652
Yes.

1090
01:30:26,753 --> 01:30:27,594
Mary Ann O'Connor?

1091
01:30:28,375 --> 01:30:28,595
Yes.

1092
01:30:29,836 --> 01:30:30,557
And McGibbon, yes.

1093
01:30:34,229 --> 01:30:39,630
Next application, 21 Fairmont Street, application number 13, poll number 1067.

1094
01:30:39,670 --> 01:30:47,312
There are no emails on 21 Fairmont, Mr. Chair.

1095
01:30:48,093 --> 01:30:49,853
Thank you, Dave, and stop reading my mind.

1096
01:30:50,453 --> 01:30:52,254
I appreciate the quick response on that too.

1097
01:30:55,016 --> 01:31:02,780
Let's see, my notes on this one, three-story building within 18 feet, 118 feet away from Wren Hall on Tufts campus.

1098
01:31:03,480 --> 01:31:06,902
Same plane and tenant is low relative to the building.

1099
01:31:07,702 --> 01:31:12,284
And just due to the sloping nature of Tufts campus.

1100
01:31:13,305 --> 01:31:20,488
So you could see what I'm talking about if you spin around, you can see the Wren Hall, which I believe is a residential hall.

1101
01:31:23,409 --> 01:31:24,330
That's Wren Hall right there.

1102
01:31:29,294 --> 01:31:36,997
This location is one of Tufts newly renovated upper class dorm buildings, the house.

1103
01:31:40,479 --> 01:31:43,160
It's my belief, I don't know that for a fact.

1104
01:31:43,741 --> 01:31:44,681
Yeah, it is Alicia.

1105
01:31:49,123 --> 01:31:53,185
And then do we have anyone from the public here for this one, Amanda?

1106
01:31:55,651 --> 01:31:57,352
I'm not seeing any raised hands.

1107
01:31:57,472 --> 01:32:11,436
Just a reminder, I'm sure this has been said already, but for anyone who wants to make a comment, you can go down to the bottom right hand of your screen and click reactions, and then to raise your hand is one of the reaction options, but I do not see anyone.

1108
01:32:11,456 --> 01:32:12,917
Thank you very much.

1109
01:32:12,937 --> 01:32:18,338
All right, open for discussion or motion.

1110
01:32:19,098 --> 01:32:20,079
Discussion first, obviously.

1111
01:32:20,659 --> 01:32:22,800
I just thought I'd like to just ask,

1112
01:32:24,662 --> 01:32:28,805
We don't have any comments from Tufts at all on any of this, is that correct?

1113
01:32:30,046 --> 01:32:30,946
I haven't received anything.

1114
01:32:31,667 --> 01:32:32,107
Okay.

1115
01:32:32,647 --> 01:32:32,867
Yeah.

1116
01:32:33,668 --> 01:32:37,450
I am aware that they are aware of this petition in general.

1117
01:32:37,991 --> 01:32:45,616
I actually had a brief conversation with Rocco DiRico from Tufts.

1118
01:32:46,156 --> 01:32:50,879
We happened to discuss that these 5Gs were in front of the city.

1119
01:32:50,899 --> 01:32:53,781
I did not ask, I actually didn't,

1120
01:32:54,738 --> 01:32:59,179
at the time I hadn't looked at the map, and I was not aware that any were in front of their properties.

1121
01:32:59,199 --> 01:33:05,020
So I didn't discuss that with him specifically, but he was aware that this hearing was happening.

1122
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:07,840
Good to know, thank you.

1123
01:33:09,821 --> 01:33:17,022
Motion to approve with our 12 standard conditions.

1124
01:33:18,122 --> 01:33:18,822
Do we hear a second?

1125
01:33:21,423 --> 01:33:21,923
I'll second.

1126
01:33:24,107 --> 01:33:24,587
Alicia Hunt?

1127
01:33:25,688 --> 01:33:25,828
Yes.

1128
01:33:26,629 --> 01:33:27,149
Paul Moki?

1129
01:33:28,070 --> 01:33:28,290
Yes.

1130
01:33:29,071 --> 01:33:29,831
Marianne O'Connor?

1131
01:33:30,391 --> 01:33:30,652
Yes.

1132
01:33:31,732 --> 01:33:32,293
Tim McGivern?

1133
01:33:32,373 --> 01:33:32,573
Yes.

1134
01:33:36,916 --> 01:33:43,241
Next one is 32 Brookings Street, application number 185554.

1135
01:33:43,481 --> 01:33:44,081
Dave, any emails?

1136
01:33:48,224 --> 01:33:49,165
We do, Mr. Chairman.

1137
01:33:49,185 --> 01:33:50,025
Okay.

1138
01:33:50,045 --> 01:33:53,648
You can go ahead and read those.

1139
01:33:55,943 --> 01:34:03,069
It's an email from, again, I apologize if I mispronounce the name, Slavica Kristic.

1140
01:34:04,030 --> 01:34:07,453
I am writing in reference to 32 Broken Streets application 18.

1141
01:34:07,513 --> 01:34:11,336
I would like to know if accepted when exactly 5G will be installed.

1142
01:34:11,856 --> 01:34:16,921
Also, what are the next cities around that Verizon is concentrating on next and within what time frame?

1143
01:34:18,022 --> 01:34:30,453
would also like to urge the reconsideration of the specific location as it is too close to Barrie Park, which is always busy with small children playing, and not to mention that many neighbors around the street are strongly opposed to it.

1144
01:34:30,793 --> 01:34:35,457
We would already receive sufficient 5G service from the other proposed sites in the vicinity.

1145
01:34:36,438 --> 01:34:38,540
Signed, Slivica.

1146
01:34:39,260 --> 01:34:43,184
There are no other regards on that location.

1147
01:34:44,567 --> 01:34:45,528
All right, thank you very much.

1148
01:34:46,029 --> 01:34:50,313
And it looks like we have a Delphine Picard.

1149
01:34:50,453 --> 01:34:52,275
I apologize if I said that incorrectly.

1150
01:34:52,435 --> 01:34:56,980
So we can unmute Delphine Picard.

1151
01:34:58,382 --> 01:35:02,126
And if you could please keep your comments brief, that would be appreciated.

1152
01:35:02,146 --> 01:35:02,867
Two minutes, please.

1153
01:35:03,608 --> 01:35:04,488
Um, sure.

1154
01:35:04,528 --> 01:35:05,189
Can you hear me?

1155
01:35:05,209 --> 01:35:06,509
I can.

1156
01:35:06,549 --> 01:35:06,809
Thank you.

1157
01:35:07,090 --> 01:35:07,570
Okay, great.

1158
01:35:08,390 --> 01:35:17,054
I just want to echo what was in the email, basically, that it's, um, a very close location to bury playground in the nearby peaceful fields.

1159
01:35:17,834 --> 01:35:29,139
Um, so I also echo what was said to about the elderly at Pearson School that is really close to a place where lots of people come, especially young Children.

1160
01:35:29,939 --> 01:35:30,279
Thank you.

1161
01:35:31,380 --> 01:35:31,620
Thank you.

1162
01:35:32,684 --> 01:35:34,746
could you state your address for the record?

1163
01:35:36,387 --> 01:35:36,967
Thank you, Amanda.

1164
01:35:38,348 --> 01:35:47,334
And Mr. Chairman, we did receive another email a little later on in the evening about 823 from Jared Johnson in regards to 32 Brookings.

1165
01:35:48,155 --> 01:35:50,957
The objection to the approval of this application based on the following grounds.

1166
01:35:51,527 --> 01:35:55,130
Verizon has indicated the location where chosen to service existing coverage gaps.

1167
01:35:55,730 --> 01:36:03,056
However, Verizon's own coverage map on their website indicates no such gaps exist and indicate adequate coverage for all Mefford Hillside.

1168
01:36:03,796 --> 01:36:08,160
The small cell policy clearly indicates that one of the requirements for application is to include a coverage map.

1169
01:36:08,700 --> 01:36:10,521
The application includes no such coverage map.

1170
01:36:11,042 --> 01:36:14,965
Additionally, there is a map with a 500-foot radius map with a red circle centered upon

1171
01:36:15,305 --> 01:36:16,906
poll number 5554.

1172
01:36:17,507 --> 01:36:24,431
This circle is actually a 250-foot radius and blatantly misleads residents to think they are further away from the cell tower than they actually are.

1173
01:36:25,952 --> 01:36:32,737
This closes by saying why approve applications that don't meet the committee's policy for something that is not needed for Verizon's own website.

1174
01:36:33,157 --> 01:36:34,818
Again, it's from Jarrett Thompson.

1175
01:36:36,439 --> 01:36:37,040
Thank you very much.

1176
01:36:41,162 --> 01:36:43,464
And Delphine, if you want to just state your address.

1177
01:36:44,129 --> 01:36:46,030
Sure, it's 10 Brookings Street.

1178
01:36:47,371 --> 01:36:49,291
Great, thank you.

1179
01:36:49,472 --> 01:36:51,733
Next in the queue is Joseph Nazaro.

1180
01:36:51,753 --> 01:36:54,514
If you could also give your address for the record.

1181
01:36:55,755 --> 01:36:56,295
Hello, Joseph.

1182
01:37:06,279 --> 01:37:11,122
Joseph, we got you?

1183
01:37:11,142 --> 01:37:11,942
Sorry, sorry.

1184
01:37:12,002 --> 01:37:13,503
It's 98 Princeton Street.

1185
01:37:14,818 --> 01:37:17,859
The question is- Joseph Nazaro, correct is your name?

1186
01:37:18,439 --> 01:37:18,679
Yes.

1187
01:37:19,339 --> 01:37:20,420
Okay, thank you.

1188
01:37:22,280 --> 01:37:33,503
Why are new polls not being installed as new polls were installed in Boston so that sensitive areas such as the ones that were discussed can be avoided?

1189
01:37:34,164 --> 01:37:36,524
Why are they just using existing polls?

1190
01:37:37,605 --> 01:37:38,825
Is it just to save money?

1191
01:37:42,119 --> 01:37:42,980
Thank you very much.

1192
01:37:43,080 --> 01:37:44,481
I can't address that one.

1193
01:37:45,882 --> 01:37:51,566
The policy does prefer a co-location, so an existing poll.

1194
01:37:53,567 --> 01:38:01,653
But if there are objections from the neighbors, why can we not use a new poll, install a new poll?

1195
01:38:02,293 --> 01:38:03,394
Other cities are doing it.

1196
01:38:03,594 --> 01:38:05,656
Why is Medford not doing it?

1197
01:38:10,179 --> 01:38:11,420
I don't think it's off the table.

1198
01:38:15,338 --> 01:38:18,900
So we have discussed it on other locations in the past.

1199
01:38:19,580 --> 01:38:21,781
The policy does indicate co-location efforts.

1200
01:38:23,582 --> 01:38:24,102
Thank you very much.

1201
01:38:24,122 --> 01:38:34,266
And then as far as some of the other questions, when installed, Verizon did address that before, but we can have them address it quickly again.

1202
01:38:34,286 --> 01:38:41,610
And as far as next cities, Verizon can answer that or not.

1203
01:38:41,650 --> 01:38:44,031
It's not relevant to Medfair, but they can if they want.

1204
01:38:46,387 --> 01:38:49,009
Mr. Chairman, we did receive an email from Ms.

1205
01:38:49,029 --> 01:38:52,552
Picard as well, reiterating the comments that she made earlier.

1206
01:38:53,453 --> 01:38:53,973
Okay, thank you.

1207
01:38:53,993 --> 01:39:04,721
All right, so I'll ask Verizon just to address the question when installed and if they desire to address the next city's question.

1208
01:39:04,801 --> 01:39:08,784
Thank you, that's the time.

1209
01:39:08,844 --> 01:39:09,865
Sure, I can grab that one.

1210
01:39:10,246 --> 01:39:11,907
The plan would be, you know, within

1211
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:18,023
within, I guess, the 30 days of getting approval and us getting the letter out, we'd want to get out there and get the site built.

1212
01:39:19,705 --> 01:39:24,608
And we talked about in the first presentation, we do have 5G going on in Boston.

1213
01:39:25,068 --> 01:39:29,651
And just to add to Mr. Nazaro's question, we've not replaced a utility pole.

1214
01:39:30,192 --> 01:39:34,555
We're not placed a new utility pole anywhere where we're doing 5G in the city of Boston.

1215
01:39:34,575 --> 01:39:38,117
We've used all existing or replaced existing light poles there.

1216
01:39:40,579 --> 01:39:40,819
Thank you.

1217
01:39:44,675 --> 01:39:53,082
Tim, could we ask that they speak to the coverage on the website, what they have on their website, the comment that was brought up?

1218
01:39:53,703 --> 01:39:54,023
Sure.

1219
01:39:54,403 --> 01:39:54,844
Mr. Conway?

1220
01:39:57,966 --> 01:40:01,009
I'm going to defer to Jason Flanagan, the RF engineer on that one.

1221
01:40:01,029 --> 01:40:05,933
I'm sorry, could you repeat the question?

1222
01:40:07,618 --> 01:40:08,359
I can summarize it.

1223
01:40:08,399 --> 01:40:13,845
It was a question about there's a map on Verizon's website that shows full coverage in this area.

1224
01:40:15,146 --> 01:40:22,855
And the purpose of the antenna would be to expand coverage with this person's understanding.

1225
01:40:22,935 --> 01:40:29,082
So it would be a question as to why these would be needed if you already have coverage in the area.

1226
01:40:30,553 --> 01:40:31,413
Ah, yes.

1227
01:40:31,574 --> 01:40:35,115
The websites on the map, I assume, are referring to the 4G coverage maps.

1228
01:40:35,135 --> 01:40:37,956
I don't believe we have any 5G coverage maps up on the website.

1229
01:40:38,056 --> 01:40:42,418
But those would be for our 4G technology, while these ones are for our 5G technology.

1230
01:40:42,438 --> 01:40:46,960
Thank you.

1231
01:40:49,841 --> 01:40:49,961
OK.

1232
01:40:54,704 --> 01:40:56,024
OK, so we've heard the emails.

1233
01:40:56,044 --> 01:40:57,045
We've heard public comment.

1234
01:40:58,446 --> 01:41:02,248
We've heard some responses from Verizon, so we can discuss it as a committee.

1235
01:41:02,268 --> 01:41:06,251
So it's open to discussion.

1236
01:41:08,012 --> 01:41:09,092
I read my measurements already.

1237
01:41:09,112 --> 01:41:24,161
It's up above.

1238
01:41:24,382 --> 01:41:26,663
It's that this one is proposed

1239
01:41:27,157 --> 01:41:38,365
to be starting at, well, the top of the utility pole, this says it's 32 feet, three inches, and the equipment will start above that.

1240
01:41:40,527 --> 01:41:46,771
It looks like it's above the top of these properties, so I'm gonna try and get that.

1241
01:41:56,288 --> 01:41:58,491
I don't see that we have grounds to deny this.

1242
01:41:59,071 --> 01:42:02,034
It's clearly going to go above the roof lines.

1243
01:42:05,918 --> 01:42:18,070
And these have all been, you've checked all these for the ADA, right, that the last one on this one, they look like, I mean, it's hard to see from the applications and from the photos, but this looks like a pretty wide sidewalk.

1244
01:42:18,090 --> 01:42:19,531
I meant to ask that about the last one.

1245
01:42:20,323 --> 01:42:24,286
Sure, yeah, just in general, just so the committee understands, I did go out and look at everyone.

1246
01:42:24,346 --> 01:42:38,238
I only measured if it was obvious that, you know, it was close or didn't make it, you know, and it's like this one, this is pretty typical in the city of Medford, where within a foot or so of the curb, you have a pole.

1247
01:42:38,858 --> 01:42:47,085
Our sidewalks are all six or six and a half feet, if you include the curb, citywide, basically, unless you're in a downtown area where obviously they're wider.

1248
01:42:47,860 --> 01:42:52,182
business area, but the vast majority of our sidewalks are six or six and a half feet.

1249
01:42:52,262 --> 01:42:58,946
So, do the math, you know, you got usually about four and a half to five feet of clearance, typically, between a pole and a property line.

1250
01:42:59,406 --> 01:43:07,671
So, you know, most of the time you can tell just by looking at it, if the clearance is there.

1251
01:43:07,691 --> 01:43:09,511
And there's vertical clearances as well, eight feet.

1252
01:43:10,112 --> 01:43:10,872
So, you know.

1253
01:43:12,493 --> 01:43:15,254
I know the last one looked tight and I meant to ask, but this one looks fine.

1254
01:43:15,495 --> 01:43:16,035
Okay, thank you.

1255
01:43:16,608 --> 01:43:18,409
Yeah, I looked at all of them.

1256
01:43:19,330 --> 01:43:19,670
Thanks.

1257
01:43:22,913 --> 01:43:29,818
Yeah, this location here, the height of this looks pretty high, especially in relation to the two closest structures there.

1258
01:43:30,759 --> 01:43:38,905
And like Alicia, you were saying, based on the criteria in our policy, I don't think there's any reason not to approve this.

1259
01:43:38,945 --> 01:43:42,668
So I'll make a motion to approve this location with the standard conditions.

1260
01:43:43,989 --> 01:43:44,930
We have a second?

1261
01:43:47,796 --> 01:43:48,236
A second.

1262
01:43:49,797 --> 01:43:51,598
I'll do a roll call vote.

1263
01:43:51,698 --> 01:43:52,218
Paul Mulkey?

1264
01:43:53,058 --> 01:43:53,318
Yes.

1265
01:43:54,579 --> 01:43:55,039
Alicia Hunt?

1266
01:43:55,879 --> 01:43:56,179
Yes.

1267
01:43:56,980 --> 01:43:57,640
Mary Ann O'Connor?

1268
01:43:58,400 --> 01:43:58,600
Yes.

1269
01:43:59,801 --> 01:44:00,361
Tim McGibbon?

1270
01:44:00,521 --> 01:44:00,721
Yes.

1271
01:44:01,582 --> 01:44:01,902
Thank you.

1272
01:44:03,943 --> 01:44:04,683
Lost my place here.

1273
01:44:05,183 --> 01:44:10,385
Next one is 42 Quincy Street, application number 51, poll number 798.

1274
01:44:13,326 --> 01:44:16,608
And let's see, any emails on this one, Dave?

1275
01:44:17,192 --> 01:44:19,172
No emails on 42 Quincy Street, Mr. Chairman.

1276
01:44:20,093 --> 01:44:27,314
OK, I see Mr. Nazaro's hand up, but we're doing site-specific comments, unless you have a site-specific comment.

1277
01:44:29,035 --> 01:44:36,517
So anybody has a site-specific comment, please put your hand up.

1278
01:44:38,877 --> 01:44:42,698
Mr. Nazaro, if it's not site-specific, could you please take your hand down?

1279
01:44:45,679 --> 01:44:45,879
Thank you.

1280
01:44:48,503 --> 01:44:51,584
Okay, my measurement for this one was 30 feet closest.

1281
01:44:52,304 --> 01:44:54,725
I'm sorry, 30 feet to the closest three-story dwelling.

1282
01:44:54,745 --> 01:45:01,308
All right, discussion from the committee.

1283
01:45:02,048 --> 01:45:04,129
They appear to be putting in a new pole.

1284
01:45:04,149 --> 01:45:07,670
The top of the proposed utility pole here says 34 feet.

1285
01:45:10,351 --> 01:45:14,552
It appears to be above the roof lines.

1286
01:45:14,852 --> 01:45:16,653
It's a little harder to tell.

1287
01:45:19,545 --> 01:45:23,726
It's, yep.

1288
01:45:27,127 --> 01:45:30,887
Tim, did you say, did you do any measurements from the closest house on this one?

1289
01:45:30,927 --> 01:45:32,728
I didn't know if you mentioned that earlier.

1290
01:45:33,028 --> 01:45:33,368
I did.

1291
01:45:33,748 --> 01:45:37,849
It was an approximate measurement, 30 feet to the closest three-story dwelling.

1292
01:45:37,869 --> 01:45:43,790
To the three-story dwelling.

1293
01:45:43,810 --> 01:45:45,451
For some reason, I only have one line on this.

1294
01:45:45,911 --> 01:45:46,891
Some of these, Paul, I did.

1295
01:45:47,780 --> 01:45:49,400
Okay.

1296
01:45:49,420 --> 01:45:50,461
10 months ago or whatever it was.

1297
01:45:50,581 --> 01:45:55,342
So, um, I confirmed a lot of it, but that was the measurement on that one.

1298
01:45:55,382 --> 01:45:56,902
Well, that looks like you're in the ballpark.

1299
01:45:56,922 --> 01:45:57,402
Yeah.

1300
01:45:58,002 --> 01:46:01,663
Sorry, I lost it.

1301
01:46:01,983 --> 01:46:09,825
Um, yeah, it seems to, it's all right.

1302
01:46:10,605 --> 01:46:12,785
Motion to approve with our standard conditions.

1303
01:46:14,086 --> 01:46:14,666
Do we have a second?

1304
01:46:14,686 --> 01:46:16,406
Second.

1305
01:46:17,937 --> 01:46:18,638
We'll call vote.

1306
01:46:18,978 --> 01:46:19,438
Paul Mulkey?

1307
01:46:20,259 --> 01:46:20,499
Yes.

1308
01:46:21,740 --> 01:46:22,240
Alicia Hunt?

1309
01:46:23,201 --> 01:46:23,321
Yes.

1310
01:46:24,182 --> 01:46:24,943
Marian O'Connor?

1311
01:46:25,443 --> 01:46:25,683
Yes.

1312
01:46:26,604 --> 01:46:27,164
Tim McGibbon?

1313
01:46:28,265 --> 01:46:28,485
Yes.

1314
01:46:29,826 --> 01:46:31,448
Next one, 25 Brooks Park.

1315
01:46:32,288 --> 01:46:34,170
Application number two, poll 700.

1316
01:46:34,830 --> 01:46:37,272
Any emails?

1317
01:46:45,018 --> 01:46:46,820
There are no emails on 25 Brooks Park.

1318
01:46:47,421 --> 01:46:47,841
Okay, thank you.

1319
01:46:49,343 --> 01:46:51,524
I don't see any hands up, but Amanda, let me know if a hand comes up.

1320
01:46:54,907 --> 01:46:55,547
Or anyone for that matter?

1321
01:46:56,008 --> 01:46:58,109
Anyone on the committee or staff?

1322
01:46:59,911 --> 01:47:01,592
No hands at the moment, but I'll let you know.

1323
01:47:02,253 --> 01:47:02,513
Thank you.

1324
01:47:03,173 --> 01:47:10,799
My measurements for this one, 37 feet away from a two-story apartment building and 90 feet away from a three-story apartment building.

1325
01:47:10,899 --> 01:47:12,400
It's at the very end of Brooks Park.

1326
01:47:12,440 --> 01:47:17,024
Brooks Park is a boulevard-style road with a very large island in the middle.

1327
01:47:19,166 --> 01:47:22,988
similar to Governor's Avenue, but it's very short and the pole is in the back.

1328
01:47:26,691 --> 01:47:27,811
There it is.

1329
01:47:28,452 --> 01:47:29,092
That's the one, yeah.

1330
01:47:29,112 --> 01:47:31,533
Yeah, that's it.

1331
01:47:33,415 --> 01:47:34,315
I knew that was a park.

1332
01:47:34,395 --> 01:47:35,916
I didn't know that was the name of the street.

1333
01:47:41,880 --> 01:47:45,282
It looks fine, relatively speaking.

1334
01:47:48,140 --> 01:47:52,943
It says it's going in at 34 feet, the top of the proposed utility poles, 34 feet.

1335
01:47:57,885 --> 01:47:59,466
We'll explain the rooftops, yeah.

1336
01:48:00,267 --> 01:48:09,892
Yeah, that's a pretty high roof there, but there's no usable space and it's got some pretty good clearances from the closest building, so.

1337
01:48:11,373 --> 01:48:13,694
Okay, motion?

1338
01:48:14,335 --> 01:48:16,456
Motion to approve with our standard conditions.

1339
01:48:17,770 --> 01:48:18,050
Second.

1340
01:48:19,731 --> 01:48:20,231
Second.

1341
01:48:21,691 --> 01:48:26,013
This one says there's a street sign to be relocated if necessary.

1342
01:48:26,033 --> 01:48:28,533
This looks like it's the new pole.

1343
01:48:29,114 --> 01:48:30,234
What is the street sign?

1344
01:48:30,314 --> 01:48:32,055
It seems to face the house.

1345
01:48:32,075 --> 01:48:34,275
Do you see the street sign there?

1346
01:48:35,596 --> 01:48:38,837
They're not talking about that sign on the pole, right, Alicia?

1347
01:48:39,497 --> 01:48:40,237
Yeah, they are.

1348
01:48:40,257 --> 01:48:40,337
Yeah.

1349
01:48:42,038 --> 01:48:42,938
Maybe that's it there.

1350
01:48:46,144 --> 01:48:53,248
Do we have any idea what sign could possibly be facing the apartment building?

1351
01:48:53,688 --> 01:48:56,070
We have no way to get a view of that from here.

1352
01:48:58,231 --> 01:49:04,815
I do not know what it is, but I think if they put it back where it is, it's fine.

1353
01:49:04,895 --> 01:49:10,358
Sorry, could I add the requirement that if they can't relocate it on the pole, then they should

1354
01:49:11,337 --> 01:49:23,529
consult with our traffic director about relocating it, and that way he can make a decision as to what it actually says and what would be appropriate.

1355
01:49:23,549 --> 01:49:26,592
I would just ask you to withdraw your first motion and just do it again.

1356
01:49:26,732 --> 01:49:28,234
Okay, yeah.

1357
01:49:28,254 --> 01:49:29,315
Withdraw that motion.

1358
01:49:29,335 --> 01:49:35,681
I would like to make a motion to approve with our 12 standard conditions and a condition

1359
01:49:36,480 --> 01:49:47,948
that they consult our traffic director on relocating the sign on the pole if they need to move it.

1360
01:49:50,750 --> 01:49:51,470
Robin, did you catch that?

1361
01:49:55,433 --> 01:49:56,134
Yes, I did.

1362
01:49:56,234 --> 01:49:58,075
But you guys are keeping track of these as well, Kerr.

1363
01:49:58,095 --> 01:49:59,796
Thank you.

1364
01:50:00,857 --> 01:50:01,077
Tim?

1365
01:50:02,758 --> 01:50:05,180
I mean, I'm making some notes.

1366
01:50:06,158 --> 01:50:06,578
Yes.

1367
01:50:15,966 --> 01:50:21,231
The other one that was like this was the one in front 200 Boston Avenue, similar, but that was a little bit different.

1368
01:50:26,355 --> 01:50:28,457
Okay, so do we get a second on that?

1369
01:50:30,819 --> 01:50:31,299
I'll second.

1370
01:50:32,380 --> 01:50:33,040
We'll call vote.

1371
01:50:33,161 --> 01:50:33,621
Paul Mulkey?

1372
01:50:34,442 --> 01:50:34,662
Yes.

1373
01:50:35,622 --> 01:50:36,182
Marianne O'Connor?

1374
01:50:36,742 --> 01:50:37,002
Yes.

1375
01:50:38,103 --> 01:50:38,563
Alicia Hunt?

1376
01:50:38,583 --> 01:50:39,723
Yes.

1377
01:50:40,963 --> 01:50:41,403
Kim McGibbon?

1378
01:50:41,423 --> 01:50:41,643
Yes.

1379
01:50:45,544 --> 01:50:52,586
So that takes care of that area.

1380
01:50:53,106 --> 01:50:57,287
So I'd like to take a five minute break.

1381
01:50:58,727 --> 01:51:00,047
Is that okay with everybody on the committee?

1382
01:51:00,568 --> 01:51:00,848
It is.

1383
01:51:00,928 --> 01:51:02,228
Sounds good, thank you.

1384
01:51:02,288 --> 01:51:02,988
Yes, please.

1385
01:51:03,248 --> 01:51:06,389
So just before we go, it's 8.55 right now.

1386
01:51:06,629 --> 01:51:07,769
So we'll be back at nine o'clock.

1387
01:51:09,650 --> 01:51:09,930
Okay.

1388
01:51:10,570 --> 01:51:11,090
All right, thank you.

1389
01:51:28,983 --> 01:51:30,884
You're moving your arms down.

1390
01:51:32,605 --> 01:51:35,367
You're getting me locked down.

1391
01:52:14,390 --> 01:52:15,431
I don't know.

1392
01:52:50,812 --> 01:52:52,232
Well, I said,

1393
01:53:21,138 --> 01:53:25,139
I said I'm critical about all of the faculty.

1394
01:53:25,220 --> 01:53:26,140
Well, that's me.

1395
01:53:26,160 --> 01:53:27,280
So it's Friday.

1396
01:53:27,380 --> 01:53:29,681
Well, do you want to work with us, do you?

1397
01:53:30,161 --> 01:53:33,122
And he said, no, but we're going to have some fun.

1398
01:53:34,203 --> 01:53:38,304
So I was like, well, come talk to me.

1399
01:58:25,259 --> 01:58:31,004
All right, I see Paul, Marianne, and Alicia.

1400
01:58:31,024 --> 01:58:47,099
Just waiting for Alicia.

1401
01:58:47,119 --> 01:58:50,703
As soon as she sits down, take a roll call attendance.

1402
01:58:54,832 --> 01:58:55,152
There she is.

1403
01:58:56,473 --> 01:58:59,355
Let's do a quick roll call attendance.

1404
01:59:00,516 --> 01:59:01,016
Paul, are you here?

1405
01:59:05,419 --> 01:59:06,420
Paul's here, but he's muted.

1406
01:59:08,181 --> 01:59:09,202
Sorry, Tim, here.

1407
01:59:09,222 --> 01:59:10,763
Okay, Marianne, you're here?

1408
01:59:11,363 --> 01:59:11,763
I'm here.

1409
01:59:12,684 --> 01:59:13,344
And Alicia?

1410
01:59:15,526 --> 01:59:15,806
Here.

1411
01:59:15,826 --> 01:59:21,230
Okay, and the rest of our team, I see Amanda.

1412
01:59:22,932 --> 01:59:25,514
And I don't see Dave yet.

1413
01:59:25,574 --> 01:59:27,174
Dave, if you're here, let me know.

1414
01:59:28,255 --> 01:59:28,635
There he is.

1415
01:59:28,655 --> 01:59:30,896
And Robin, we got you too?

1416
01:59:34,838 --> 01:59:35,579
And we got Robin, okay.

1417
01:59:35,619 --> 01:59:37,620
All right.

1418
01:59:40,261 --> 01:59:47,865
Okay, we're moving on to the next portion of the agenda, portion four, applications in Medford Square in the Glenwood vicinity.

1419
01:59:49,743 --> 01:59:55,567
All right, next one is 13 Bradley Road, application number 22, poll number 5515.

1420
01:59:55,627 --> 01:59:59,629
Dave, do we have any emails on this one?

1421
02:00:03,011 --> 02:00:06,994
We do not have any emails for this one or any of the remaining applications.

1422
02:00:07,654 --> 02:00:10,916
I can update if we receive any during the meeting.

1423
02:00:10,956 --> 02:00:11,637
OK, thank you very much.

1424
02:00:16,094 --> 02:00:20,616
Amanda, if you see anybody with their hand up or Dave or anybody on the committee, let me know.

1425
02:00:22,397 --> 02:00:23,337
And we'll go there.

1426
02:00:23,357 --> 02:00:33,422
And folks, we'll just remind folks again, too, if you can use that raise hand function, then that's helpful because it bumps it to the top of my screen so I can see easily.

1427
02:00:33,442 --> 02:00:43,947
Okay, my notes on this one, the antenna is within 60 feet of a four-story residential building.

1428
02:00:49,332 --> 02:00:50,052
That's all I had for that one.

1429
02:01:03,281 --> 02:01:05,683
So committee discussion, questions.

1430
02:01:06,343 --> 02:01:10,206
That looks pretty wide open at that site, Tim.

1431
02:01:11,235 --> 02:01:14,236
The pole height is almost 35 feet, 3411.

1432
02:01:14,396 --> 02:01:18,078
So that looks like it's got some pretty good clearances.

1433
02:01:18,098 --> 02:01:19,639
I don't see any issues with that one.

1434
02:01:19,659 --> 02:01:21,039
Okay.

1435
02:01:22,640 --> 02:01:24,281
Any other comments or questions from the committee?

1436
02:01:24,301 --> 02:01:31,064
I don't have anything.

1437
02:01:32,485 --> 02:01:34,706
Motion to approve with our standard conditions.

1438
02:01:35,946 --> 02:01:36,226
Okay.

1439
02:01:37,207 --> 02:01:37,747
I'll second.

1440
02:01:38,788 --> 02:01:39,628
Second from Paul.

1441
02:01:41,181 --> 02:01:42,321
And we'll take a roll call vote.

1442
02:01:42,361 --> 02:01:42,861
Paul Mulkey?

1443
02:01:43,581 --> 02:01:43,862
Yes.

1444
02:01:45,622 --> 02:01:46,322
Mary Ann O'Connor?

1445
02:01:55,904 --> 02:01:56,244
Mary Ann?

1446
02:01:57,864 --> 02:01:58,044
Yes.

1447
02:01:58,064 --> 02:01:59,785
Sorry, I just didn't hear you.

1448
02:01:59,965 --> 02:02:00,445
Didn't come through.

1449
02:02:00,925 --> 02:02:01,445
Alicia Hunt?

1450
02:02:02,025 --> 02:02:02,285
Yes.

1451
02:02:03,245 --> 02:02:03,465
Okay.

1452
02:02:03,625 --> 02:02:04,526
And I'm of a yes as well.

1453
02:02:05,026 --> 02:02:06,626
So that one passes with 12 conditions.

1454
02:02:12,099 --> 02:02:14,401
Next application is 87 4th Street.

1455
02:02:17,062 --> 02:02:19,924
Application number 23, poll number 973.

1456
02:02:21,905 --> 02:02:28,890
And similar comment on this one, 60 feet to a three-story residential building.

1457
02:02:29,851 --> 02:02:31,592
So it was at 4th Street there.

1458
02:02:35,603 --> 02:02:38,745
And if you have a comment from the public, please raise your hand.

1459
02:02:39,285 --> 02:02:45,508
Otherwise we will have a discussion, questions, comments from the committee.

1460
02:02:45,948 --> 02:02:50,590
This one too, I think it's probably got the most clearance of any poll on our list.

1461
02:02:50,690 --> 02:02:53,852
It's well away from the closest residential structures.

1462
02:03:01,796 --> 02:03:04,517
This one going in front of the,

1463
02:03:06,062 --> 02:03:08,704
a lot that I was inquiring about.

1464
02:03:08,724 --> 02:03:16,429
Oh no, I'm off by a block.

1465
02:03:16,489 --> 02:03:19,571
I was asking about the one that was up by Webster Street.

1466
02:03:19,631 --> 02:03:22,913
This is down by Forest Street or Water Street.

1467
02:03:22,933 --> 02:03:25,916
It's a little bit closer to the square.

1468
02:03:25,936 --> 02:03:29,438
I didn't have any issues with this one.

1469
02:03:34,260 --> 02:03:37,602
I was going to approve with our standard 12 conditions.

1470
02:03:39,143 --> 02:03:39,683
I'll second.

1471
02:03:40,944 --> 02:03:42,465
All right, Paul, you can have the next one if you want.

1472
02:03:43,166 --> 02:03:44,286
No, I'll wait.

1473
02:03:44,446 --> 02:03:45,267
Let me know, Harry.

1474
02:03:45,287 --> 02:03:47,969
All right, we'll do roll call vote.

1475
02:03:48,029 --> 02:03:48,489
Paul Moki?

1476
02:03:49,269 --> 02:03:49,490
Yes.

1477
02:03:50,390 --> 02:03:50,991
Mary Ann O'Connor?

1478
02:03:51,491 --> 02:03:51,711
Yes.

1479
02:03:52,371 --> 02:03:52,832
Jason Hunt?

1480
02:03:53,492 --> 02:03:53,692
Yes.

1481
02:03:54,413 --> 02:03:55,533
Tim McGibbon, also yes.

1482
02:04:00,016 --> 02:04:02,318
Next is 10 Cherry Street, application 28.

1483
02:04:04,488 --> 02:04:07,169
Poll number 1350, 1,350.

1484
02:04:10,051 --> 02:04:12,792
My notes on this, partial double poll.

1485
02:04:12,812 --> 02:04:17,795
I observed it's on a partial double poll.

1486
02:04:17,835 --> 02:04:23,197
So again, it's our standard condition about the poll, not being on a double poll would apply to that.

1487
02:04:25,478 --> 02:04:30,501
The antenna is within 40 feet of a three-story residential building.

1488
02:04:56,415 --> 02:04:57,656
Should we get the right poll here?

1489
02:05:01,479 --> 02:05:03,520
Doesn't look like the right one.

1490
02:05:03,540 --> 02:05:06,643
No, it does not.

1491
02:05:07,664 --> 02:05:09,425
There we go.

1492
02:05:11,587 --> 02:05:16,670
And since the application happened, oh, we can actually see the installation happening.

1493
02:05:16,690 --> 02:05:17,231
Look at that.

1494
02:05:20,305 --> 02:05:20,706
No one knows.

1495
02:05:20,986 --> 02:05:22,087
Hopefully they got their permit, Paul.

1496
02:05:23,228 --> 02:05:25,070
Yeah.

1497
02:05:26,691 --> 02:05:31,195
Is there a cutoff second pole that's attached to the main pole there?

1498
02:05:31,215 --> 02:05:34,438
I don't know if you can change that angle at all, Alicia.

1499
02:05:35,118 --> 02:05:36,840
That was my comment.

1500
02:05:36,860 --> 02:05:38,842
Yeah, there's a partial pole up there.

1501
02:05:39,222 --> 02:05:39,522
Yeah.

1502
02:05:40,523 --> 02:05:43,726
So I would want Verizon

1503
02:05:44,518 --> 02:05:45,399
to address that.

1504
02:05:45,419 --> 02:05:50,003
Yeah, I wrote partial poll, I was thinking double poll, but no, this is a weird partial poll up there.

1505
02:05:51,424 --> 02:05:52,585
Just looks so crowded up there.

1506
02:05:52,725 --> 02:05:56,828
So I wanna know a little bit more about what the plan is for that and that should be cleaned up.

1507
02:05:58,290 --> 02:05:59,951
You have to replace that, Tim?

1508
02:06:00,171 --> 02:06:02,333
Is that what you're saying?

1509
02:06:02,653 --> 02:06:05,055
It's a matter of, is that partial?

1510
02:06:05,115 --> 02:06:07,858
It looks like they cut the poll out and left a chunk.

1511
02:06:08,576 --> 02:06:17,504
They left a chunk and they probably left a chunk for a reason, probably because Elisey's equipment was on there and they couldn't remove that chunk of pole without damaging Elisey's equipment.

1512
02:06:17,584 --> 02:06:21,707
I'm guessing I, you know, educated guests, but we can have Verizon address that.

1513
02:06:22,888 --> 02:06:34,798
Uh, but before we do that, before, before Stan or Sean speaks, just want to see if there are, uh, any individuals from the public want to speak on this one?

1514
02:06:36,239 --> 02:06:36,880
Any hands or anything?

1515
02:06:40,588 --> 02:06:41,268
doesn't look like there is.

1516
02:06:44,009 --> 02:06:49,692
Stan or someone from Verizon, Sean, do you want to address the partial poll up there?

1517
02:06:52,953 --> 02:06:53,653
Yeah, sure.

1518
02:06:54,493 --> 02:06:56,494
Sean, do you want to jump on this?

1519
02:06:56,574 --> 02:06:58,295
But I will tell you that typically,

1520
02:06:58,962 --> 02:07:07,738
when we're waiting for transfers to take place, there will be chunks of the old pole left until the transfers are made, and then that comes off the pole.

1521
02:07:08,379 --> 02:07:11,605
But Sean, if you could clarify further, please go ahead.

1522
02:07:26,761 --> 02:07:28,962
I think that's our answer then, Mr. Chair.

1523
02:07:29,462 --> 02:07:30,042
Go ahead.

1524
02:07:30,102 --> 02:07:30,603
I'm sorry.

1525
02:07:30,663 --> 02:07:33,664
That looks like there's a lot going on.

1526
02:07:34,964 --> 02:07:35,565
Marianne, one second.

1527
02:07:35,605 --> 02:07:36,765
Just let Verizon finish.

1528
02:07:36,805 --> 02:07:38,226
Don't forget your thought.

1529
02:07:39,606 --> 02:07:39,946
I'm sorry.

1530
02:07:39,986 --> 02:07:40,827
I was double muted.

1531
02:07:40,927 --> 02:07:43,228
I can just echo what Stan said.

1532
02:07:43,708 --> 02:07:46,869
We will have that portion of the pole removed before the small cell will be built.

1533
02:07:47,729 --> 02:07:47,970
OK.

1534
02:07:48,210 --> 02:07:51,571
Yeah, and both of those statements are consistent with my understanding of how this happens.

1535
02:07:51,731 --> 02:07:54,012
So Marianne, go ahead.

1536
02:07:54,612 --> 02:07:57,073
No, it just, it looks like there's a lot going on there.

1537
02:07:57,113 --> 02:08:03,176
So I'm not sure how that's gonna get addressed.

1538
02:08:03,216 --> 02:08:04,396
So they'll have to remove.

1539
02:08:05,837 --> 02:08:13,821
Yeah, so you can see there's pieces of timber that is sort of holding up the partial pole, right?

1540
02:08:14,161 --> 02:08:16,782
Like almost like wood dunnage holding up the partial pole.

1541
02:08:17,082 --> 02:08:17,582
And then you got,

1542
02:08:20,176 --> 02:08:24,589
uh, you know, communication services, basically all those lower wires.

1543
02:08:24,610 --> 02:08:24,650
Um,

1544
02:08:26,768 --> 02:08:28,429
It looks like a bit of a bird's nest there.

1545
02:08:29,409 --> 02:08:36,072
So I'm going to suggest on the motion that in addition to the 12 conditions, and this is just clarification, because it's not really a double pole.

1546
02:08:36,272 --> 02:08:42,215
It's more like some chunks of an old pole are still left up there because it's in process of transfer.

1547
02:08:42,675 --> 02:08:54,521
So I would suggest the special condition that the partial pole be completely removed, just like Mr. Conway stated is the intent, but just to solidify that.

1548
02:08:56,853 --> 02:09:01,856
So you want to add that as an additional condition to a regular conditions, Tim, is that what you're saying?

1549
02:09:02,277 --> 02:09:06,580
If the committee so desires and the individual who moves so desires.

1550
02:09:07,760 --> 02:09:09,542
Yeah, I would like to have that added.

1551
02:09:10,062 --> 02:09:15,386
Okay.

1552
02:09:15,426 --> 02:09:18,287
Any more discussion from the committee or any other questions?

1553
02:09:18,327 --> 02:09:26,333
No, I just want to note that the application says existing street sign to be relocated if necessary.

1554
02:09:27,610 --> 02:09:30,931
But I don't see any street sign on the pole.

1555
02:09:30,951 --> 02:09:39,035
I would hope that if in changing out the pole, there was a street sign, they dealt with it appropriately.

1556
02:09:42,036 --> 02:09:46,417
But I've also been looking at it from different angles and I don't see a street sign.

1557
02:09:46,437 --> 02:09:48,158
Yeah, I see the note.

1558
02:09:48,678 --> 02:09:49,078
Yeah.

1559
02:09:50,079 --> 02:09:50,879
Yeah, you're right, Alicia.

1560
02:09:51,639 --> 02:09:52,119
Good catch.

1561
02:09:52,179 --> 02:09:53,100
I don't see any sign either.

1562
02:09:53,120 --> 02:09:55,741
And I also don't see a sign in the

1563
02:09:57,421 --> 02:09:58,361
in the application.

1564
02:09:59,102 --> 02:09:59,882
In the image?

1565
02:10:00,442 --> 02:10:00,702
Yeah.

1566
02:10:01,002 --> 02:10:02,423
Maybe, kind of?

1567
02:10:03,443 --> 02:10:04,583
Like a shadow, maybe.

1568
02:10:04,923 --> 02:10:05,224
Yeah.

1569
02:10:06,344 --> 02:10:06,624
All right.

1570
02:10:08,505 --> 02:10:16,607
So there could be a condition to confirm, a confirmatory type condition if they're supposed to be assigned there.

1571
02:10:18,548 --> 02:10:25,210
I'm not sure how we would do that though, looking at past images or we don't have a...

1572
02:10:26,463 --> 02:10:39,656
Perhaps the condition could just be that they consult with the city's traffic director to ensure that any sign that's supposed to be on the pole is replaced once the new poles finish being installed.

1573
02:10:40,557 --> 02:10:42,298
Yeah, I think that covers it, Robin.

1574
02:10:42,318 --> 02:10:42,659
Thank you.

1575
02:10:42,679 --> 02:10:49,065
That does have a pretty good handle on all the street signs in Medford somehow.

1576
02:10:51,059 --> 02:10:52,680
Yeah.

1577
02:10:52,780 --> 02:10:54,200
We don't have a formal inventory.

1578
02:10:54,260 --> 02:10:55,821
We're working on it, but we don't have one yet.

1579
02:10:55,881 --> 02:10:59,283
So it's, um, you know, don't let that out.

1580
02:10:59,543 --> 02:11:02,864
I guess I just did, but he gives me the impression he has an inventory.

1581
02:11:02,884 --> 02:11:03,405
Okay.

1582
02:11:03,485 --> 02:11:18,471
Wait, so move to approve with our 12 conditions and that the piece of a pole is fully removed before the, uh,

1583
02:11:20,588 --> 02:11:40,159
put it on site and the director of transportation is conferred with about the sign that is mentioned in the application to confirm that it's replaced if appropriate, or if he deems necessary.

1584
02:11:40,179 --> 02:11:41,499
Okay.

1585
02:11:45,862 --> 02:11:46,422
Do we have a second?

1586
02:11:49,604 --> 02:11:50,064
I'll second.

1587
02:11:55,340 --> 02:11:55,920
I'm just taking a note.

1588
02:12:00,441 --> 02:12:02,141
All these ones is one of the stranger ones.

1589
02:12:02,201 --> 02:12:04,542
It's like, so some of them are so mundane.

1590
02:12:04,562 --> 02:12:07,902
This one is interesting because we don't know if they should be assigned there.

1591
02:12:08,822 --> 02:12:09,823
Boy, it's interesting.

1592
02:12:10,323 --> 02:12:10,463
Okay.

1593
02:12:10,843 --> 02:12:11,283
Paul Moki?

1594
02:12:12,223 --> 02:12:12,423
Yes.

1595
02:12:13,503 --> 02:12:14,223
Marian O'Connor?

1596
02:12:19,945 --> 02:12:22,325
Marian, you may have voted and we didn't hear you again, potentially.

1597
02:12:24,628 --> 02:12:25,309
That's frozen.

1598
02:12:25,329 --> 02:12:28,351
All right, we'll go back to Alicia Hunt.

1599
02:12:29,031 --> 02:12:29,291
Yes.

1600
02:12:30,112 --> 02:12:30,652
Yes, okay.

1601
02:12:32,033 --> 02:12:33,314
Marianne is frozen.

1602
02:12:33,334 --> 02:12:39,138
So we might need to wait a second here.

1603
02:12:49,182 --> 02:12:51,065
Dave, I don't have Marianne's number.

1604
02:12:51,145 --> 02:12:51,946
Do you think you could?

1605
02:12:52,066 --> 02:12:52,306
I do.

1606
02:12:52,367 --> 02:12:53,208
I just texted her.

1607
02:12:53,608 --> 02:12:53,809
We did.

1608
02:12:53,869 --> 02:12:54,089
OK.

1609
02:12:54,229 --> 02:12:54,430
OK.

1610
02:12:54,590 --> 02:12:56,092
We'll see what she says.

1611
02:12:56,112 --> 02:12:57,053
We'll just hang tight for a minute.

1612
02:13:03,162 --> 02:13:03,723
I have a few guys.

1613
02:13:25,014 --> 02:13:26,579
It looks like Marianne dropped from the meeting.

1614
02:13:26,599 --> 02:13:28,165
She just wanted to give her a minute.

1615
02:14:02,529 --> 02:14:03,530
Back to you on text?

1616
02:14:05,032 --> 02:14:05,292
No.

1617
02:14:05,873 --> 02:14:06,093
No.

1618
02:14:06,193 --> 02:14:06,433
Okay.

1619
02:14:07,494 --> 02:14:10,097
And she did text me earlier in the evening.

1620
02:14:10,117 --> 02:14:14,302
Confirmed.

1621
02:14:14,922 --> 02:14:16,344
Oh, she says lost connection.

1622
02:14:17,445 --> 02:14:18,226
Oh, lost connection.

1623
02:14:18,246 --> 02:14:18,366
Okay.

1624
02:14:41,097 --> 02:14:45,139
I got all kinds of jokes running through my head, but most of them.

1625
02:14:45,820 --> 02:14:47,101
I know, I'll share with him later.

1626
02:14:47,121 --> 02:14:48,602
Yeah, we'll talk later.

1627
02:14:49,082 --> 02:14:51,383
It's stupid, you know, it's stupid.

1628
02:14:52,644 --> 02:14:54,025
Most of my jokes are pretty stupid.

1629
02:14:56,466 --> 02:15:00,109
Well, you're an engineer, you're supposed to have stupid jokes.

1630
02:15:00,369 --> 02:15:01,710
I know, I got a million of them.

1631
02:15:01,730 --> 02:15:06,853
Sorry, that is funny.

1632
02:15:17,078 --> 02:15:18,118
How long do we wait, you guys?

1633
02:15:21,920 --> 02:15:30,862
Robin, can we actually consult you about if there are three of us, should we keep vote on this?

1634
02:15:31,602 --> 02:15:34,563
Give her a minute and see if she can get back in.

1635
02:15:35,344 --> 02:15:37,864
Let's just take a short break then instead of just sitting around.

1636
02:15:38,205 --> 02:15:41,826
I'm sure folks might need to use the restroom or get a drink or something.

1637
02:15:41,866 --> 02:15:45,927
So let's just do just three minutes and we'll see where we're at.

1638
02:15:46,319 --> 02:15:48,880
Maybe someone can give her a call and see if she can get back in.

1639
02:15:49,380 --> 02:15:49,580
Yeah.

1640
02:15:50,320 --> 02:15:52,121
I'll give her a call now, see if we can get a hold of her.

1641
02:15:52,261 --> 02:15:53,461
Yeah, I did talk to her.

1642
02:15:53,481 --> 02:15:54,621
She's trying to hop in now.

1643
02:15:55,101 --> 02:15:57,562
If she can't use her computer, she's going to jump on her phone.

1644
02:15:58,182 --> 02:15:59,543
It's going to take a few moments.

1645
02:16:00,523 --> 02:16:00,963
All right.

1646
02:16:00,983 --> 02:16:02,083
Well, let's do the three minutes.

1647
02:16:02,183 --> 02:16:02,664
It's 920.

1648
02:16:02,704 --> 02:16:04,284
We'll come back at 923, please.

1649
02:16:05,744 --> 02:16:06,665
If folks need to do that.

1650
02:16:06,685 --> 02:16:06,725
So 923.

1651
02:16:21,017 --> 02:16:23,118
Dave, I just admitted her, you'll have to make her.

1652
02:16:25,219 --> 02:16:29,221
Marianne, we decided to take three minutes while we waited for you to get hooked up.

1653
02:16:39,447 --> 02:16:40,267
Can they see me now?

1654
02:16:40,548 --> 02:16:41,108
Can they hear me now?

1655
02:16:42,738 --> 02:16:43,279
Roger that.

1656
02:16:43,299 --> 02:16:46,042
You got your name changed.

1657
02:16:46,062 --> 02:16:49,866
I don't know, my internet just disappeared somehow.

1658
02:16:50,506 --> 02:16:51,087
It happens.

1659
02:16:51,447 --> 02:16:52,568
I'm on the phone.

1660
02:16:52,628 --> 02:16:53,109
I'm here too.

1661
02:16:55,471 --> 02:16:56,432
Did I hear you call my name?

1662
02:16:57,233 --> 02:16:59,676
No, no, I was just confirming that Marianne was there.

1663
02:16:59,776 --> 02:17:01,478
You said Roger, I thought you said Robin.

1664
02:17:01,658 --> 02:17:02,439
I thought I heard it.

1665
02:17:06,161 --> 02:17:08,522
I suppose someone named Roger could have piped up too.

1666
02:17:09,162 --> 02:17:14,304
Do I need like three more hours on my phone battery here to make sure we get this done?

1667
02:17:14,965 --> 02:17:15,465
I'm kidding.

1668
02:17:17,766 --> 02:17:24,509
If you drop off again or... Let's just have to end the meeting, that's it.

1669
02:17:24,929 --> 02:17:25,949
We would still have a quorum.

1670
02:17:26,129 --> 02:17:26,790
That's true.

1671
02:17:27,350 --> 02:17:28,370
So that's true.

1672
02:17:28,750 --> 02:17:29,791
I don't know what happened.

1673
02:17:30,231 --> 02:17:30,891
Dear Lord.

1674
02:17:31,692 --> 02:17:33,472
You gotta stop tempting me with jokes.

1675
02:17:33,652 --> 02:17:34,613
I mean, we're at...

1676
02:17:35,118 --> 02:17:36,839
We're in a 5G coverage.

1677
02:17:38,639 --> 02:17:40,440
That's why you need jokes, Tim.

1678
02:17:41,281 --> 02:17:45,422
I know, but I feel like it's inappropriate, so I'm not going to do it.

1679
02:17:47,663 --> 02:17:50,304
So you guys were in the middle of voting 10 Cherry Street?

1680
02:17:50,324 --> 02:17:52,305
Yes.

1681
02:17:52,365 --> 02:17:52,585
OK.

1682
02:17:52,625 --> 02:17:54,466
So just got to wait two more minutes and then.

1683
02:17:54,626 --> 02:17:54,746
OK.

1684
02:17:55,546 --> 02:17:56,587
All right.

1685
02:17:56,627 --> 02:17:59,208
Let me see what I can do with this thing while we're waiting.

1686
02:17:59,288 --> 02:17:59,488
Yeah.

1687
02:18:00,108 --> 02:18:00,949
Find yourself a charger.

1688
02:18:00,969 --> 02:18:02,189
Make sure you make sure you're in good shape.

1689
02:18:02,449 --> 02:18:02,569
Yeah.

1690
02:18:02,629 --> 02:18:02,689
OK.

1691
02:18:02,709 --> 02:18:02,869
Yep.

1692
02:18:13,819 --> 02:18:16,860
Over here, it's actually getting cold outside.

1693
02:18:53,880 --> 02:18:55,080
Thank you for everybody's patience.

1694
02:19:09,944 --> 02:19:11,105
Hi, Marianne, you're in good shape, you think?

1695
02:19:17,927 --> 02:19:18,607
Couple more seconds.

1696
02:19:22,867 --> 02:19:24,528
put that one back up.

1697
02:19:28,469 --> 02:19:31,989
The next thing that's going to happen is Marianne is going to cast your vote and that would be all of us.

1698
02:19:32,469 --> 02:19:32,930
Well, then me.

1699
02:19:32,990 --> 02:19:33,290
I'm sorry.

1700
02:19:33,410 --> 02:19:33,890
Marianne, then me.

1701
02:19:36,250 --> 02:19:36,550
Yes.

1702
02:19:37,651 --> 02:19:37,871
Yes.

1703
02:19:38,471 --> 02:19:42,692
That was a yes on the motion to approve with the conditions as stated.

1704
02:19:46,533 --> 02:19:47,533
And my vote is yes as well.

1705
02:19:47,553 --> 02:19:49,373
All right.

1706
02:19:49,794 --> 02:19:51,554
Next one, 101 Sheridan Avenue.

1707
02:19:52,703 --> 02:19:54,964
Oh, I'm sorry, sorry, sorry, we already did that one.

1708
02:19:55,644 --> 02:19:56,285
It's next on the list.

1709
02:19:58,245 --> 02:20:04,128
Next one is 148 Washington Street, application 32, poll number 1317, 1,317.

1710
02:20:04,268 --> 02:20:12,011
The poll is actually in the Otis Street right of way, close to the intersection.

1711
02:20:18,935 --> 02:20:20,055
You have a hand raised.

1712
02:20:21,896 --> 02:20:22,096
Thank you.

1713
02:20:23,994 --> 02:20:31,838
Bryce, and I apologize if I mispronounce, Shinsius, you're welcome to speak, and if you could state your address for the record.

1714
02:20:36,320 --> 02:20:36,761
Thank you.

1715
02:20:36,981 --> 02:20:38,341
It's Bryce Shinsius.

1716
02:20:38,762 --> 02:20:42,804
I'm the director of Kurukula Center for Tibetan Buddhist Studies.

1717
02:20:43,844 --> 02:20:49,387
I'm appearing tonight in that capacity, and we are located at 68 Mojiko Avenue.

1718
02:20:55,365 --> 02:20:58,006
So I have a site-specific comment with respect to application 32.

1719
02:20:58,066 --> 02:21:03,648
This site is in the immediate vicinity of our backyard.

1720
02:21:06,269 --> 02:21:18,513
In view of all the information presented during this meeting, our intention here is to recommend against the approval of application 32 strictly on cybersecurity grounds, which by Verizon's own admission is a substantial concern.

1721
02:21:20,185 --> 02:21:29,367
It is a well-settled point that Tibetan people, including members of the Tibetan diaspora within the U.S., are known targets of espionage efforts by the Chinese state.

1722
02:21:30,387 --> 02:21:34,548
As such, our temple community is uniquely sensitive to concerns about cybersecurity.

1723
02:21:34,568 --> 02:21:47,610
I want to make clear that our organization's objection to this specific application is made wholly based on cybersecurity concerns and is unrelated to other considerations such as health, safety, or environmental impact.

1724
02:21:48,610 --> 02:22:02,986
It would be useful to know how the introduction of this 5G equipment would differ from existing equipment with respect to security and privacy vulnerabilities for users whose data transits the equipment, both as a function of the equipment design and the sourcing of its components.

1725
02:22:05,869 --> 02:22:06,790
Thank you very much, Bryce.

1726
02:22:09,536 --> 02:22:12,560
I will ask Verizon to address that question.

1727
02:22:12,580 --> 02:22:15,023
And Bryce, if you could hang on.

1728
02:22:15,684 --> 02:22:22,653
I heard the question, but I want to make sure if there's any questions on the question that Verizon is able to get a response from you.

1729
02:22:22,673 --> 02:22:25,256
There was some detail in there that I think was important.

1730
02:22:30,262 --> 02:22:39,291
So if I could ask Verizon to address that question, it is, I would say, I believe it sounds outside of our purview here today.

1731
02:22:41,294 --> 02:22:44,537
However, that doesn't mean that we can't ask Verizon to address it.

1732
02:22:49,135 --> 02:22:52,056
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Tim Trudovsky, Robinson and Cole.

1733
02:22:53,136 --> 02:23:05,120
I would agree with the chair's most recent comment that this, you know, that aspect of the concerns raised by the abutter here are beyond the purview of this committee.

1734
02:23:05,580 --> 02:23:08,360
It's not within the interim policy.

1735
02:23:08,901 --> 02:23:17,203
Also, you know, this facility and all the proposed facilities on the agenda this evening are in compliance with applicable

1736
02:23:17,808 --> 02:23:19,929
FCC and other federal regulations.

1737
02:23:21,289 --> 02:23:27,132
So for those reasons, we would object to a denial on those grounds.

1738
02:23:29,433 --> 02:23:29,773
Thank you.

1739
02:23:29,793 --> 02:23:39,737
And we have a site-specific question from Mr. Nazaro.

1740
02:23:45,436 --> 02:23:45,776
Yes.

1741
02:23:47,437 --> 02:23:59,505
Is it against the FCC regulations to consider the security and the privacy of the people of Medford as it is to not consider their health concerns?

1742
02:24:00,466 --> 02:24:02,167
Is this something that's prohibited?

1743
02:24:02,947 --> 02:24:05,589
If it isn't prohibited, why can't it be considered?

1744
02:24:05,609 --> 02:24:09,692
Thank you very much, Mr. Nazaro.

1745
02:24:12,192 --> 02:24:15,073
And Mr. Podolsky, if maybe you can address that one as well.

1746
02:24:18,655 --> 02:24:30,479
The cybersecurity concern is not one that is explicitly addressed in the FCC regulations on the same level that the health effects considerations are directly addressed.

1747
02:24:30,519 --> 02:24:34,721
But again, this is not, you know, part of the,

1748
02:24:36,366 --> 02:24:38,347
the interim policy adopted by the city.

1749
02:24:39,028 --> 02:24:49,216
And also I would comment that that is not a site specific question, but a question or a concern that could be raised with any location anywhere in the city of Medford, not just this location.

1750
02:24:50,537 --> 02:24:51,097
Thank you very much.

1751
02:24:51,117 --> 02:24:54,259
And I would agree, I believe that this is outside of our purview.

1752
02:24:55,300 --> 02:24:56,841
So thank you very much.

1753
02:24:56,861 --> 02:24:59,824
Bryce, did you have addition?

1754
02:24:59,844 --> 02:25:00,604
Okay, thank you, Bryce.

1755
02:25:03,286 --> 02:25:03,947
I appreciate it.

1756
02:25:03,967 --> 02:25:05,648
So we have, I believe we have the correct

1757
02:25:06,252 --> 02:25:07,573
We have the correct poll up there.

1758
02:25:07,613 --> 02:25:08,714
I was in the middle of checking that.

1759
02:25:08,734 --> 02:25:10,296
I just wanted to make sure we have the correct poll up there.

1760
02:25:19,063 --> 02:25:20,765
Tim, you got a poll number for this one?

1761
02:25:22,046 --> 02:25:22,286
Yes.

1762
02:25:23,047 --> 02:25:24,728
Is this the correct one on the screen?

1763
02:25:25,129 --> 02:25:27,451
And I believe Bryce raised his hand again.

1764
02:25:27,471 --> 02:25:27,511
OK.

1765
02:25:29,132 --> 02:25:29,733
It's poll number 1317.

1766
02:25:29,833 --> 02:25:30,253
OK, thanks.

1767
02:25:33,845 --> 02:25:35,325
Bryce, you did have some time left there.

1768
02:25:35,565 --> 02:25:39,766
If you could be brief, go ahead and unmute Bryce.

1769
02:25:40,086 --> 02:25:41,407
I would call you Mr. Shin.

1770
02:25:41,547 --> 02:25:42,507
I just- No, no.

1771
02:25:42,587 --> 02:25:43,587
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

1772
02:25:43,707 --> 02:25:45,088
Bryce is more than sufficient.

1773
02:25:45,448 --> 02:25:47,388
As I've said before, I've been called worse.

1774
02:25:48,148 --> 02:26:03,452
Just briefly, contrary to council's assertion, my comment was unique to this site because we are the only Tibetan temple in the city of Medford, and hence the concerns about cybersecurity as they relate

1775
02:26:04,052 --> 02:26:07,734
to members of the Tibetan diaspora are indeed unique to this site.

1776
02:26:08,514 --> 02:26:08,834
Thank you.

1777
02:26:09,394 --> 02:26:09,974
Thank you very much.

1778
02:26:13,476 --> 02:26:25,441
My understanding of Mr. Twardowski's comments were more pertaining to Mr. Navarro's comments, this person after you, which was more general for the city.

1779
02:26:26,641 --> 02:26:27,341
But anyway, thank you.

1780
02:26:28,862 --> 02:26:30,563
We have one more person.

1781
02:26:31,243 --> 02:26:32,604
Mr. Swanson.

1782
02:26:32,624 --> 02:26:33,464
Hello, Mr. Swanson.

1783
02:26:34,967 --> 02:26:36,968
Hi, sorry, this is Eric Swanson.

1784
02:26:37,309 --> 02:26:38,669
I'm a consultant for CTI.

1785
02:26:38,689 --> 02:26:48,396
I just wanted to give you a point of information that the security associated with 5G infrastructures is just as secure as 4G, which is just as secure as 3G.

1786
02:26:48,436 --> 02:26:50,257
There's really nothing different.

1787
02:26:50,797 --> 02:26:53,679
It's kind of a rumor out there that 5G is less secure.

1788
02:26:56,621 --> 02:26:57,361
Thank you, Mr. Swanson.

1789
02:26:59,763 --> 02:26:59,843
OK.

1790
02:27:03,522 --> 02:27:07,784
All right, and Alicia, did you say you believe this was the correct wall?

1791
02:27:07,864 --> 02:27:12,107
I was just asking if somebody else wanted to verify.

1792
02:27:12,127 --> 02:27:16,989
I didn't look it on the, I mean, if you have the overhead view of it.

1793
02:27:18,110 --> 02:27:19,911
1317 to answer your question.

1794
02:27:19,971 --> 02:27:26,315
I think that's actually the backyard of the temple as was mentioned there.

1795
02:27:30,317 --> 02:27:32,338
I thought that their yard actually came

1796
02:27:33,202 --> 02:27:33,602
right up.

1797
02:27:33,622 --> 02:27:39,924
I mean, if you want to go, um, okay, this is, this is helpful.

1798
02:27:40,144 --> 02:27:41,144
Okay.

1799
02:27:41,904 --> 02:27:42,064
Yeah.

1800
02:27:42,084 --> 02:27:44,225
If you go from Washington to Otis street, it's on the right.

1801
02:27:45,105 --> 02:27:46,325
That looks correct.

1802
02:27:46,525 --> 02:27:48,186
And that looks like the right number.

1803
02:27:48,206 --> 02:27:48,186
1 3 1 7.

1804
02:27:50,786 --> 02:27:51,947
That looks like the right ball there.

1805
02:27:52,207 --> 02:27:52,887
There we go.

1806
02:27:53,847 --> 02:27:57,948
And it otherwise looks like it's in a fine location.

1807
02:27:58,208 --> 02:28:01,829
I do understand the concerns of

1808
02:28:02,897 --> 02:28:04,717
uh, Bryce about this.

1809
02:28:05,718 --> 02:28:11,059
Um, we have a very active, um, Buddhist temple there.

1810
02:28:11,879 --> 02:28:20,921
Um, but it seems that it's not something that we really have any purview over under our policy.

1811
02:28:21,221 --> 02:28:30,723
And unless somebody has any information to disprove what the consultant is saying that it's the same technology as 3G and 4G,

1812
02:28:35,232 --> 02:28:36,673
I don't think that there's anything.

1813
02:28:39,413 --> 02:28:42,094
Yeah, I think the opposition is noted.

1814
02:28:42,114 --> 02:28:46,554
And Bryce was very eloquent in his description of his concern.

1815
02:28:47,895 --> 02:28:49,215
So definitely noted.

1816
02:28:49,715 --> 02:28:54,536
But I do believe it's outside of our purview in the policy as written.

1817
02:28:55,816 --> 02:28:57,236
So we have it all on record.

1818
02:28:59,077 --> 02:29:01,137
That's about as we can do at this point.

1819
02:29:04,175 --> 02:29:05,055
Discussion from the committee?

1820
02:29:13,837 --> 02:29:14,957
There's no discussion.

1821
02:29:15,657 --> 02:29:17,837
I motion to approve with our standard conditions.

1822
02:29:17,857 --> 02:29:20,858
Do we hear a second?

1823
02:29:20,878 --> 02:29:23,338
I'll second.

1824
02:29:24,619 --> 02:29:25,459
All right, Alicia Hunt?

1825
02:29:26,279 --> 02:29:26,479
Yes.

1826
02:29:27,339 --> 02:29:27,839
Paul Mulkey?

1827
02:29:28,559 --> 02:29:28,799
Yes.

1828
02:29:29,459 --> 02:29:30,179
Marion O'Connor?

1829
02:29:30,640 --> 02:29:30,960
Yes.

1830
02:29:31,780 --> 02:29:32,940
Tim McGivern, also yes.

1831
02:29:38,493 --> 02:29:49,557
All right, next up we have 4 Central Avenue, applicant number 33, poll number 6063, 6063.

1832
02:29:50,537 --> 02:30:02,321
And my measurement was 65 feet away from four three-story residential buildings.

1833
02:30:05,562 --> 02:30:06,262
Sorry, how many feet?

1834
02:30:06,282 --> 02:30:06,482
65 feet.

1835
02:30:26,173 --> 02:30:27,894
Not that pole, obviously, right?

1836
02:30:33,440 --> 02:30:37,184
It's on the north side of the street between Dudley and Park.

1837
02:30:41,669 --> 02:30:41,869
There.

1838
02:30:46,505 --> 02:30:47,585
Yeah.

1839
02:30:48,086 --> 02:30:49,166
Was I just showing it?

1840
02:30:49,346 --> 02:30:49,846
Sorry.

1841
02:30:49,926 --> 02:30:52,407
I think you just had a second ago, Alicia.

1842
02:30:57,950 --> 02:30:58,530
Yeah.

1843
02:30:58,550 --> 02:31:00,171
So this one on the left here.

1844
02:31:02,452 --> 02:31:04,513
Pretty far from those houses.

1845
02:31:07,134 --> 02:31:08,554
Looks like it's the new pole.

1846
02:31:08,574 --> 02:31:11,235
I don't know if that's the new one, actually.

1847
02:31:11,255 --> 02:31:12,116
It looks pretty dark.

1848
02:31:13,156 --> 02:31:15,097
This says there is going to be a new pole.

1849
02:31:15,969 --> 02:31:19,870
that would be the top of the pole would be 34 feet.

1850
02:31:19,890 --> 02:31:33,394
Existing street signs we relocated three feet minimum from pole space.

1851
02:31:33,414 --> 02:31:41,756
Sorry, I was going to the other side to see the street sign and I ran away.

1852
02:31:41,776 --> 02:31:42,717
There we go.

1853
02:31:44,082 --> 02:31:47,104
Snow emergency route is the sign on it.

1854
02:31:47,184 --> 02:31:48,785
Let me see if I can get that back to you.

1855
02:31:57,251 --> 02:31:57,731
Lost.

1856
02:32:08,038 --> 02:32:10,019
Here, I'm getting expert at this.

1857
02:32:10,659 --> 02:32:11,060
There we go.

1858
02:32:12,309 --> 02:32:13,849
We used to do without Street View.

1859
02:32:15,950 --> 02:32:18,030
We used to do a lot more.

1860
02:32:18,991 --> 02:32:23,752
It'd take a lot more staff to be able to look at all these things.

1861
02:32:25,152 --> 02:32:30,414
So it's this indicates that it's going to be that the sign would stay.

1862
02:32:30,434 --> 02:32:36,135
I think they were suggesting up or down maybe.

1863
02:32:39,811 --> 02:32:48,858
Can we just include a condition that the street sign has to be relocated appropriately with consultation of our traffic?

1864
02:32:51,820 --> 02:32:53,241
Is that a motion or a suggestion?

1865
02:32:54,262 --> 02:32:55,583
Does anybody think differently?

1866
02:32:55,823 --> 02:33:00,227
Do we know what the sign says?

1867
02:33:00,607 --> 02:33:02,789
Yeah, it's a snow emergency route.

1868
02:33:07,887 --> 02:33:09,908
No emergency route tow zone sign.

1869
02:33:14,149 --> 02:33:24,312
All right, motion to approve with our standard conditions and that the sign relocation has to be done with consultation of our traffic director.

1870
02:33:24,332 --> 02:33:31,413
All right, do I hear a second?

1871
02:33:33,574 --> 02:33:33,934
Second.

1872
02:33:35,255 --> 02:33:36,255
All right, we'll call vote.

1873
02:33:37,533 --> 02:33:37,773
Yes.

1874
02:33:37,793 --> 02:33:38,954
Alicia Hunt?

1875
02:33:39,795 --> 02:33:39,995
Yes.

1876
02:33:40,616 --> 02:33:41,196
Marion O'Connor?

1877
02:33:41,837 --> 02:33:42,077
Yes.

1878
02:33:42,917 --> 02:33:43,418
Tim McGibbon?

1879
02:33:43,598 --> 02:33:43,798
Yes.

1880
02:33:43,818 --> 02:33:50,744
All right, 72 Salem Street, number 21, the application number 21.

1881
02:33:51,905 --> 02:33:52,565
Poll number 5,645, 5645.

1882
02:33:52,846 --> 02:33:59,171
The poll is actually in the Oakland Street right of way.

1883
02:34:01,773 --> 02:34:06,177
The closest residential space is 100 plus feet away, but pure hockey?

1884
02:34:07,152 --> 02:34:17,499
is a place of business and it's directly blocked.

1885
02:34:17,519 --> 02:34:20,801
That one?

1886
02:34:20,861 --> 02:34:25,885
That looks correct, yeah.

1887
02:34:26,245 --> 02:34:27,886
Right across from us here at City Hall.

1888
02:34:27,906 --> 02:34:32,569
So we're not that far away.

1889
02:34:32,589 --> 02:34:36,212
Does that mean we'll get 5G service here in City Hall?

1890
02:34:40,978 --> 02:34:47,102
Anything would be better than the internet service we haven't seen.

1891
02:34:47,203 --> 02:34:50,024
After this, you may just want to do a hotspot with your phone or something.

1892
02:34:50,145 --> 02:34:50,565
Yeah.

1893
02:34:52,046 --> 02:34:52,366
Anyway.

1894
02:34:53,447 --> 02:34:54,488
I've been known to do it.

1895
02:35:00,712 --> 02:35:04,635
Existing street sign to be relocated if necessary.

1896
02:35:04,695 --> 02:35:06,576
It's a no parking sign.

1897
02:35:11,866 --> 02:35:14,207
The top of the pole is 38 feet.

1898
02:35:17,730 --> 02:35:25,755
So that's going to be well above that one story commercial building and it's nowhere near any residences.

1899
02:35:26,516 --> 02:35:26,776
Right.

1900
02:35:28,077 --> 02:35:32,360
Nice coverage right there into our DPW office.

1901
02:35:33,921 --> 02:35:39,145
Motion to approve with our standard condition.

1902
02:35:43,381 --> 02:35:45,342
Did you want to add the sign one?

1903
02:35:46,603 --> 02:35:58,072
With the sign relocation if necessary to be, if it's necessary to relocate the sign in consultation with our traffic director.

1904
02:35:58,092 --> 02:36:01,014
Okay, do I hear a second?

1905
02:36:02,535 --> 02:36:02,875
Second.

1906
02:36:05,217 --> 02:36:05,838
All right, one second.

1907
02:36:06,078 --> 02:36:06,938
Roll call vote.

1908
02:36:07,619 --> 02:36:08,139
Paul Mulkey?

1909
02:36:08,900 --> 02:36:09,120
Yes.

1910
02:36:10,361 --> 02:36:10,861
Alicia Hunt?

1911
02:36:11,662 --> 02:36:11,882
Yes.

1912
02:36:14,201 --> 02:36:14,481
Yes.

1913
02:36:15,682 --> 02:36:16,582
And to me given is yes.

1914
02:36:20,684 --> 02:36:24,226
Right next 117 Court Street application number 26 pole 4612 4612.

1915
02:36:24,286 --> 02:36:36,731
We already voted for it, but Amanda, you didn't see any hands up for 72 C on the street, did you?

1916
02:36:48,899 --> 02:36:50,840
I didn't, nothing came up with the indicator.

1917
02:36:50,900 --> 02:36:53,480
So I just didn't ask that.

1918
02:36:54,641 --> 02:36:55,741
So anyway.

1919
02:36:56,601 --> 02:36:58,742
Sorry, I couldn't find my unmute button for a second.

1920
02:36:58,902 --> 02:37:00,122
Um, no, no hands came up.

1921
02:37:00,582 --> 02:37:01,123
That's what I thought.

1922
02:37:01,283 --> 02:37:03,123
I just wanted to double check, double check.

1923
02:37:03,183 --> 02:37:04,063
All right.

1924
02:37:04,444 --> 02:37:06,564
Uh, this one, 17 court street.

1925
02:37:06,924 --> 02:37:08,805
Um, uh, we haven't heard from Dave.

1926
02:37:08,845 --> 02:37:15,927
So, uh, Dave, just if you want to just confirm you're still here and you haven't seen any emails for the ones that we're talking about, like you stated.

1927
02:37:16,875 --> 02:37:17,595
I am still here.

1928
02:37:17,615 --> 02:37:20,417
There have been no more emails received.

1929
02:37:21,838 --> 02:37:23,319
Last email was received at 820.

1930
02:37:24,980 --> 02:37:26,641
OK, thank you.

1931
02:37:27,882 --> 02:37:31,104
So I'm in the wrong place.

1932
02:37:33,766 --> 02:37:35,267
While you're doing that, I'll read my measurements.

1933
02:37:36,127 --> 02:37:40,510
20 feet away from a three story dwelling, 75 feet away from the Roberts School.

1934
02:37:40,530 --> 02:37:43,672
Oh, I'm on Park Street, sorry.

1935
02:37:44,887 --> 02:37:45,587
I think you just had it.

1936
02:37:46,167 --> 02:37:51,989
No, I was on Park Street and there was a big old transformer, so I knew it couldn't possibly be right.

1937
02:38:01,851 --> 02:38:03,412
One of these two here.

1938
02:38:06,332 --> 02:38:09,453
One by the house as opposed to the one right by the school.

1939
02:38:10,253 --> 02:38:11,754
Right in front of a house, it looks like.

1940
02:38:12,554 --> 02:38:12,974
That one.

1941
02:38:15,961 --> 02:38:17,182
It's at the other end of the school.

1942
02:38:18,383 --> 02:38:20,284
Is it this one, or am I at the wrong end?

1943
02:38:21,404 --> 02:38:22,085
You're at the wrong end.

1944
02:38:22,145 --> 02:38:25,647
It's at the entrance to the bus driveway, Court Street.

1945
02:38:27,067 --> 02:38:27,648
Thank you.

1946
02:38:33,451 --> 02:38:34,472
This one.

1947
02:38:35,932 --> 02:38:37,393
That's the one, Alicia, right there.

1948
02:38:37,413 --> 02:38:38,834
All right.

1949
02:38:41,275 --> 02:38:41,896
This one is this.

1950
02:38:42,532 --> 02:38:46,395
says the proposed utility pole will be 34 feet.

1951
02:38:49,337 --> 02:38:52,299
The top of the existing pole is 29 feet.

1952
02:38:53,079 --> 02:38:57,482
I wonder if this is the existing or the new.

1953
02:38:59,203 --> 02:39:09,330
That looks to be like the existing one based off of the photo and the equipment on it compared to the picture with the application.

1954
02:39:11,267 --> 02:39:14,048
So there'll be a new pole put here that's 34 feet.

1955
02:39:17,669 --> 02:39:18,169
Correct?

1956
02:39:18,509 --> 02:39:24,111
Top of the pole, 34 feet, just like Lisa said, you got it with the antenna on top of that.

1957
02:39:24,351 --> 02:39:27,132
Does the existing street sign to be relocated?

1958
02:39:27,152 --> 02:39:40,657
And I'd be more than happy for that if it becomes necessary to put it on a separate pole or this is a slower children, this is an elementary school.

1959
02:39:42,931 --> 02:39:47,234
It does have a lot of traffic from little children.

1960
02:39:50,436 --> 02:39:54,158
There's plenty of clearance on that sidewalk.

1961
02:39:54,218 --> 02:39:56,299
The pole does seem to be set back a little.

1962
02:39:57,940 --> 02:40:00,602
Yeah, that's more than four feet right there.

1963
02:40:01,202 --> 02:40:01,262
OK.

1964
02:40:01,302 --> 02:40:01,462
Yeah.

1965
02:40:10,845 --> 02:40:13,327
And so I measured 75 feet to the Robert school.

1966
02:40:13,967 --> 02:40:15,828
And obviously that's a four story building.

1967
02:40:16,469 --> 02:40:20,731
So my kids go to Robert school.

1968
02:40:21,112 --> 02:40:22,913
I mean, I have no objections though.

1969
02:40:25,575 --> 02:40:33,600
Um, is there any thought that we might ask them to upgrade this, this slow children's sign better?

1970
02:40:33,620 --> 02:40:36,562
That is such a butt of jokes.

1971
02:40:39,751 --> 02:40:41,112
Yeah, I know.

1972
02:40:42,532 --> 02:40:55,334
Yeah, it is the, I mean, if there's a new standard or anything like that, I think that would be reasonable to say, you know, replace the sign if there's a new standard.

1973
02:40:55,354 --> 02:40:57,435
I'm not sure if there is or not.

1974
02:41:02,016 --> 02:41:03,276
They do change the graphics.

1975
02:41:04,576 --> 02:41:06,037
It does look like one of the older ones.

1976
02:41:10,405 --> 02:41:17,527
but that could be something similar that we did at 200 Boston Avenue where we said, upgrade the sign to current standards.

1977
02:41:21,188 --> 02:41:27,110
Yeah, I feel like it's such a minimal thing and it's the least we can request.

1978
02:41:28,290 --> 02:41:28,470
Yeah.

1979
02:41:30,211 --> 02:41:33,032
Like I said, I don't know for sure, but it looks like one of the older.

1980
02:41:33,692 --> 02:41:35,873
That's fine, let's move on that, that's good.

1981
02:41:40,785 --> 02:41:42,086
Anybody else want to say this?

1982
02:41:44,266 --> 02:41:49,168
So Alicia just said you want to make that as a condition of the sign.

1983
02:41:49,949 --> 02:41:50,249
Okay.

1984
02:41:51,189 --> 02:41:59,652
So I'll make a motion to approve this site with our standing conditions and an additional condition to upgrade the sign to cover standards.

1985
02:42:02,973 --> 02:42:10,016
And place them with the, any relocation occurs with the consultation of our traffic director.

1986
02:42:11,072 --> 02:42:18,316
And I'd like to also add that any additional placement is approved by the traffic engineer consultant.

1987
02:42:19,837 --> 02:42:20,057
OK.

1988
02:42:21,217 --> 02:42:23,599
Upgrade to new standard.

1989
02:42:25,320 --> 02:42:27,361
Location confirmed.

1990
02:42:27,381 --> 02:42:30,102
Second.

1991
02:42:30,122 --> 02:42:32,984
All right, second.

1992
02:42:33,124 --> 02:42:33,944
Do roll call vote.

1993
02:42:34,664 --> 02:42:35,165
Paul Moki?

1994
02:42:36,365 --> 02:42:36,605
Yes.

1995
02:42:36,625 --> 02:42:38,546
Alicia Hunt?

1996
02:42:39,267 --> 02:42:39,447
Yes.

1997
02:42:40,973 --> 02:42:41,553
Mary Anne O'Connor?

1998
02:42:42,654 --> 02:42:42,874
Yes.

1999
02:42:44,095 --> 02:42:44,976
Tim McGibbon, yes.

2000
02:42:50,660 --> 02:42:59,666
Okay, 45 Brogan Road, application 27, and it's 6734, full number.

2001
02:43:01,207 --> 02:43:07,972
It's an easy one to find, it's right at 45 Brogan Road, which is right in front of that house.

2002
02:43:09,386 --> 02:43:13,427
So this one also does not meet 88 clearance.

2003
02:43:14,787 --> 02:43:25,829
The resident did speak on this application during the general comment period, and I believe, I think it is Mr. Silvestro, Mr. Silvestro will give you an opportunity to speak in a moment.

2004
02:43:27,090 --> 02:43:28,930
So that measures 35 inches.

2005
02:43:31,591 --> 02:43:33,691
That's not it, but when we get there.

2006
02:43:34,391 --> 02:43:34,791
That one?

2007
02:43:36,212 --> 02:43:36,752
This one here?

2008
02:43:37,892 --> 02:43:38,032
Nope.

2009
02:43:38,807 --> 02:43:40,087
not the slow children one.

2010
02:43:40,107 --> 02:43:42,768
I'm sorry.

2011
02:43:42,788 --> 02:43:43,748
It's okay.

2012
02:43:44,768 --> 02:43:48,829
We'll find it.

2013
02:43:49,090 --> 02:43:51,630
The president had said he had measured 30 inches.

2014
02:43:51,730 --> 02:43:52,130
I measured 35.

2015
02:43:52,210 --> 02:43:54,651
Oh, is it this one?

2016
02:43:54,971 --> 02:43:57,912
It's right in the middle of the sidewalk?

2017
02:43:58,472 --> 02:43:59,252
That is the one.

2018
02:43:59,312 --> 02:44:00,332
That's the pole.

2019
02:44:00,912 --> 02:44:06,994
You would think when they put in the new one, which it looks like they did, they would have put it closer to the edge.

2020
02:44:09,378 --> 02:44:14,301
Well, anyway, obviously there's a single story building right there, 12 feet away.

2021
02:44:15,842 --> 02:44:18,663
Other dwellings approximately 95 plus feet away.

2022
02:44:19,223 --> 02:44:25,487
And I'd like Mr. Silvestro to speak.

2023
02:44:25,547 --> 02:44:26,147
Hello, George.

2024
02:44:33,551 --> 02:44:34,292
Hi, thank you.

2025
02:44:36,492 --> 02:44:41,996
Yes, I just wanted to say that, you know, it doesn't meet the standard of the 36 inches.

2026
02:44:42,737 --> 02:44:43,017
Yes.

2027
02:44:43,077 --> 02:44:44,958
The pole is in the middle of the sidewalk.

2028
02:44:46,119 --> 02:44:50,443
It just, it's, it doesn't work.

2029
02:44:50,863 --> 02:44:52,524
There's other poles in the neighborhood.

2030
02:44:52,964 --> 02:45:00,730
The one that they rejected on, they have it down as 303 Park street, heavily treed.

2031
02:45:00,890 --> 02:45:01,991
It's a double pole.

2032
02:45:03,072 --> 02:45:05,714
There is a tree near it, but it's not that heavily.

2033
02:45:06,628 --> 02:45:19,091
And the 294 Park Street is actually 53 Brogan Road, that pole, 5485, that's at 53 Brogan Road.

2034
02:45:19,111 --> 02:45:25,452
And on Park Street 214, 2214, the pole at 295, they have indicated as, it's actually 297.

2035
02:45:38,316 --> 02:45:42,119
287 actually has a 2214 pole.

2036
02:45:44,421 --> 02:45:49,765
They all look like to me that they could put it over there, to be honest.

2037
02:45:53,268 --> 02:46:00,033
It's just, you know, the pole, there are double poles, not double poles, there's two poles with the same number on the same street.

2038
02:46:02,535 --> 02:46:04,937
So there's a lot of confusion on the poles.

2039
02:46:05,683 --> 02:46:08,985
There is another pole right across the street on the corner of Brogan.

2040
02:46:10,006 --> 02:46:13,469
I mean, Brogan and Court.

2041
02:46:13,569 --> 02:46:14,429
Right by the park.

2042
02:46:15,270 --> 02:46:17,491
That's clearly visible out in the open.

2043
02:46:19,313 --> 02:46:21,154
And there's another pole right there.

2044
02:46:21,174 --> 02:46:24,236
That one there.

2045
02:46:25,697 --> 02:46:30,240
Looks like a perfect pole to me, but I'm not qualified to make that decision.

2046
02:46:30,260 --> 02:46:32,682
And at 84 Court Street,

2047
02:46:34,874 --> 02:46:42,359
There's another perfect looking pole.

2048
02:46:42,399 --> 02:46:46,142
Thank you very much, Mr. and I'm assuming Mrs. Silvestro.

2049
02:46:46,542 --> 02:46:48,124
Yes, thank you very much.

2050
02:46:48,864 --> 02:46:49,264
You're welcome.

2051
02:46:50,966 --> 02:46:52,107
Thank you for your comments.

2052
02:46:52,127 --> 02:46:52,447
Thank you.

2053
02:46:52,947 --> 02:47:01,213
So I will ask Verizon to address some of those comments that the Silvestro had.

2054
02:47:02,054 --> 02:47:02,334
Thank you.

2055
02:47:06,370 --> 02:47:06,990
This is Sean.

2056
02:47:07,911 --> 02:47:14,035
If I could just speak to the poll that we selected, that's obviously was dropped in the middle of the sidewalk there.

2057
02:47:14,596 --> 02:47:24,983
I would ask that if we could have a continuance and go back to the utility and talk to them about moving that poll into ADA compliance and outside, you know, out to the edge of the sidewalk.

2058
02:47:25,003 --> 02:47:28,986
Right.

2059
02:47:29,206 --> 02:47:32,188
I mean, that's what our biggest

2060
02:47:34,648 --> 02:47:37,769
That's our grounds for a problem here with it.

2061
02:47:41,950 --> 02:47:45,331
It wouldn't be easier for you to use one of the other poles.

2062
02:47:46,151 --> 02:47:51,533
And I guess the other question is, Tim, parts of this sidewalk look really narrow.

2063
02:47:52,393 --> 02:47:55,014
Do we think they could move it, the pole?

2064
02:47:56,254 --> 02:48:01,235
Is the sidewalk wide enough that if it was placed properly at the edge?

2065
02:48:01,255 --> 02:48:03,256
Sure.

2066
02:48:04,502 --> 02:48:21,313
So when something like this happens, and I don't know, I'm speculating here, just based off my experience, it may be that they encountered some sort of obstruction or utility or weren't able to put the pole in the proper location.

2067
02:48:22,173 --> 02:48:29,098
I don't know why it was done this way, but those are some potential reasons which happen now and then.

2068
02:48:29,118 --> 02:48:32,000
I'm surprised that,

2069
02:48:33,505 --> 02:48:39,850
They didn't measure it afterwards and say, oh, we can't do that, you know, and then put it back in, put it in the right place.

2070
02:48:40,170 --> 02:48:45,294
Regardless, if it's a new pole and we don't have the clearances, it's not in the right spot anyway.

2071
02:48:46,555 --> 02:48:57,202
So unlike that other, the other one on Winthrop Street, which didn't really have much wiggle room, this one may have some wiggle room, but it's hard to know.

2072
02:48:57,243 --> 02:49:00,445
Like I, like I stated, why, you know, the reason why it landed where it landed.

2073
02:49:00,465 --> 02:49:03,187
So I don't know if that's helpful.

2074
02:49:06,620 --> 02:49:13,483
In my opinion, it's in the best interest of the city to get it moved, because that would be the most benefit to the most people.

2075
02:49:16,144 --> 02:49:19,545
Although that doesn't help the disastrous who don't want it there.

2076
02:49:19,565 --> 02:49:22,866
I think they may wanna speak again.

2077
02:49:22,926 --> 02:49:26,367
I feel like their hand went back up, but also Stan's hand is up.

2078
02:49:28,008 --> 02:49:28,248
Ms.

2079
02:49:28,288 --> 02:49:31,529
Nazarro, I will let you speak.

2080
02:49:31,549 --> 02:49:33,270
I just wanna make sure it's site-specific.

2081
02:49:38,919 --> 02:49:39,299
Go ahead, Ms.

2082
02:49:39,379 --> 02:49:39,739
Nazar.

2083
02:49:41,480 --> 02:49:45,343
I thought we were trying to stay away from playgrounds where children play.

2084
02:49:45,383 --> 02:49:47,424
Is this not across the street from a playground?

2085
02:49:48,764 --> 02:49:50,785
The policy doesn't define any setbacks.

2086
02:49:51,806 --> 02:49:52,566
Yeah, correct.

2087
02:49:52,626 --> 02:49:54,968
But that was the discussion previously.

2088
02:49:55,748 --> 02:50:04,033
The policy states that they have to say why it's near a house or a playground.

2089
02:50:04,593 --> 02:50:07,975
It doesn't actually say they have to stay away from playgrounds.

2090
02:50:14,607 --> 02:50:21,833
Let's continue, and let's, Mrs. Syl, let the Sylvestros have something else to say.

2091
02:50:21,853 --> 02:50:22,834
I'd like to hear it.

2092
02:50:24,035 --> 02:50:24,655
Hi, thank you.

2093
02:50:25,276 --> 02:50:31,921
The pole, that's, like I said, the pole was hit by lightning 20 years ago.

2094
02:50:31,961 --> 02:50:33,943
It took them 20 years to get out there and change it.

2095
02:50:35,044 --> 02:50:37,666
The pole was actually- Half of a pole.

2096
02:50:37,966 --> 02:50:41,008
Two feet over, away from the house.

2097
02:50:41,769 --> 02:50:42,730
This one is closer.

2098
02:50:44,104 --> 02:50:49,666
with, you know, my property line is only 10 feet from the sidewalk.

2099
02:50:51,027 --> 02:51:00,010
And my picture window, it just, I can't physically live in a house and look at that every day.

2100
02:51:00,430 --> 02:51:02,611
It's just, it's not good for my health.

2101
02:51:03,271 --> 02:51:04,371
It just really isn't.

2102
02:51:05,792 --> 02:51:06,152
You've

2103
02:51:06,652 --> 02:51:09,275
whether they move the pole or not and make compliance.

2104
02:51:09,776 --> 02:51:15,142
The sidewalk still does not meet one sixth of the street's dimension.

2105
02:51:16,203 --> 02:51:17,525
It does not fit.

2106
02:51:17,785 --> 02:51:19,367
The sidewalk is too small.

2107
02:51:20,148 --> 02:51:26,135
The street used to be my family street, Brogan Road is my wife's maiden name.

2108
02:51:26,669 --> 02:51:29,510
They owned the park, they gave it to the city.

2109
02:51:30,370 --> 02:51:36,891
Years ago, they had the choice of taking the park name or the street name.

2110
02:51:37,651 --> 02:51:39,071
They elected to take the street.

2111
02:51:39,571 --> 02:51:43,532
It's just, they donated it to the city.

2112
02:51:43,972 --> 02:51:47,853
That's the least they can do is put it somewhere else.

2113
02:51:48,393 --> 02:51:49,673
That's all I'm asking for.

2114
02:51:50,393 --> 02:51:50,793
Thank you.

2115
02:51:51,073 --> 02:51:51,994
Thank you very much.

2116
02:51:53,454 --> 02:51:53,974
Thank you very much.

2117
02:51:56,030 --> 02:52:06,297
We don't have a lot of control as you may have discovered as you have been watching this here.

2118
02:52:06,557 --> 02:52:09,840
Tim, we're saying it's not ADA compliant though, correct?

2119
02:52:10,680 --> 02:52:11,321
As it sits.

2120
02:52:12,041 --> 02:52:24,190
Could we ask, if they're asking to continue this, to go back to the utility and see about changing it, could we ask that they consider moving the pole a few feet further down and away?

2121
02:52:25,678 --> 02:52:30,741
Although the sidewalk seems to get narrower as it gets closer to us.

2122
02:52:31,321 --> 02:52:37,344
And if they're going to move it, move it diagonally and not just towards the road.

2123
02:52:37,884 --> 02:52:39,685
I'm looking at the wires that are on this.

2124
02:52:39,745 --> 02:52:46,528
They seem to have a lot of flexibility with this.

2125
02:52:48,409 --> 02:52:48,649
Yeah.

2126
02:52:51,416 --> 02:52:55,798
And if we could unmute Mrs. Silvestro for a question from me here.

2127
02:52:57,299 --> 02:53:08,203
Mr. Silvestro and Mrs. Silvestro, the existing pole that was there prior before this new pole, as you look at this screen, was it closer to us?

2128
02:53:10,664 --> 02:53:12,805
It was more west of my house.

2129
02:53:13,326 --> 02:53:14,206
It was going west.

2130
02:53:14,866 --> 02:53:15,967
It was closer to Court Street.

2131
02:53:19,400 --> 02:53:19,700
Okay.

2132
02:53:20,100 --> 02:53:26,462
And my Verizon, that's my Verizon cable coming from Court Street.

2133
02:53:26,622 --> 02:53:28,923
My utilities come from Court Street.

2134
02:53:28,963 --> 02:53:32,384
The only thing that comes from Brogan Road is my electricity.

2135
02:53:33,145 --> 02:53:33,325
Okay.

2136
02:53:33,505 --> 02:53:33,785
Thank you.

2137
02:53:35,826 --> 02:53:36,086
Thank you.

2138
02:53:36,106 --> 02:53:37,046
You clarify that for me.

2139
02:53:37,326 --> 02:53:38,086
Thank you.

2140
02:53:38,406 --> 02:53:39,407
I was trying to understand.

2141
02:53:41,390 --> 02:53:44,052
The pole location, this pole.

2142
02:53:44,352 --> 02:53:46,493
It was west, it goes west on Brogan.

2143
02:53:46,733 --> 02:53:50,015
The existing pole before it got hit by lightning was west.

2144
02:53:50,135 --> 02:53:53,317
It was being held up by the tree on the corner of Court Street.

2145
02:53:54,017 --> 02:53:54,298
Got it.

2146
02:53:55,018 --> 02:53:59,941
They never put a brace on that side, that's why the pole lists to the east.

2147
02:54:01,222 --> 02:54:03,203
I'm with you, I follow, I follow.

2148
02:54:03,343 --> 02:54:05,144
That's where it was, over there, yes.

2149
02:54:05,612 --> 02:54:08,234
Yeah, the sidewalk looks narrow Alicia.

2150
02:54:09,074 --> 02:54:11,516
It's very narrow it's not one sixth of the street.

2151
02:54:13,237 --> 02:54:16,819
Yeah, the, it doesn't have to be one sixth of the street so the sidewalk.

2152
02:54:19,587 --> 02:54:23,988
is supposed to be five feet wide at a minimum, mostly in Medford they're six feet.

2153
02:54:24,608 --> 02:54:36,252
I'm not exactly sure what this is, but they can be as narrow as four feet and street furniture needs a clearance of three feet, 36 inches.

2154
02:54:37,252 --> 02:54:47,675
So those are a summary of those rules, but I'm wondering to the committee for discussion here, I'm wondering if

2155
02:54:50,175 --> 02:55:08,028
you know, when they're looking at that pole location and moving it to an appropriate offset, they only need an inch basically, can it be moved west to the original pole location that was there before?

2156
02:55:08,849 --> 02:55:14,032
If there was a pole there before and it was serving the same functions, you know, there's obviously distance,

2157
02:55:15,282 --> 02:55:18,104
distance criteria and parameters when they put these poles in.

2158
02:55:19,484 --> 02:55:29,230
I don't know the reason why it was moved closer in the easterly direction, and I don't think any of us do, really.

2159
02:55:29,410 --> 02:55:34,312
And Tim, are you suggesting a few feet, right?

2160
02:55:34,352 --> 02:55:35,573
You're not suggesting

2161
02:55:38,273 --> 02:55:39,894
50 feet, right?

2162
02:55:39,994 --> 02:55:40,194
No.

2163
02:55:41,695 --> 02:55:43,415
Stan, I'll let you speak in a minute.

2164
02:55:44,256 --> 02:55:48,437
No, I'm talking about where the existing pole was prior to this pole.

2165
02:55:48,477 --> 02:55:59,362
So the previous pole when they replaced this one, which if I understand Mrs. Sylvester correctly, it'll be a few feet to the west, just out of the visual frame of his house and his picture window.

2166
02:55:59,382 --> 02:55:59,422
So,

2167
02:56:03,495 --> 02:56:05,019
Let's think about that as a committee.

2168
02:56:05,159 --> 02:56:06,964
And Stan did have his hand up.

2169
02:56:07,605 --> 02:56:08,528
Stan, we can hear from you.

2170
02:56:08,548 --> 02:56:09,290
Thank you.

2171
02:56:10,581 --> 02:56:19,106
Yeah, clearly we would be interested in moving within the grant of location that we have, and that's usually a few feet either way.

2172
02:56:20,226 --> 02:56:21,947
This can be easily cured.

2173
02:56:22,627 --> 02:56:38,856
And I think approving it with that condition and having a site visit with yourself, Mr. Chairman, and the resident, we can come to an appropriate accommodation.

2174
02:56:41,012 --> 02:56:44,940
That aligns with conceptually what I was thinking, Stan.

2175
02:56:47,303 --> 02:57:00,208
The utility pole locations do have some flexibility as far as where they get put based off the utilities, what's underground, obstructions, limitations, distances from other poles, what they're holding up, all of these variables.

2176
02:57:00,768 --> 02:57:04,250
So it would be the pole's owner's responsibility to confirm that.

2177
02:57:05,570 --> 02:57:10,612
I am inclined to try to craft a condition on this one that

2178
02:57:13,386 --> 02:57:13,987
allows that.

2179
02:57:14,107 --> 02:57:19,773
And if it can't be done, then obviously you can't meet the conditions.

2180
02:57:19,973 --> 02:57:25,038
So it sounds like Verizon is open to something like that.

2181
02:57:25,138 --> 02:57:28,382
So I'll leave it to the committee here for discussion.

2182
02:57:29,225 --> 02:57:33,427
Tim, I'm assuming you need the approval from the utilities company as well.

2183
02:57:34,327 --> 02:57:37,008
Yeah, that's what Stan was referencing, and that's what I was referencing as well.

2184
02:57:37,048 --> 02:57:41,170
So the owner of the pole, so these are jointly owned poles, most of them.

2185
02:57:41,270 --> 02:57:43,671
I'm not sure what this one is, but most poles are jointly owned.

2186
02:57:43,691 --> 02:57:45,972
We can look at the application to see who owns it, but it doesn't matter.

2187
02:57:46,612 --> 02:57:56,536
Whoever is that owner or owners would need to be involved and would be the entity that actually pulls this pole and puts the other one in.

2188
02:57:59,280 --> 02:58:03,044
that they would be a critical piece to that equation.

2189
02:58:05,066 --> 02:58:11,392
So Tim, would the process be to, would they withdraw their application for this?

2190
02:58:12,052 --> 02:58:17,738
Would we take a vote to just request more information on possible relocation?

2191
02:58:17,798 --> 02:58:21,962
What do you think is the best procedural way to go about that?

2192
02:58:22,736 --> 02:58:30,819
Well, I think what Stan just floated, it aligned with what I was thinking, which was to try to condition this.

2193
02:58:31,119 --> 02:58:45,365
So to get the pole moved westerly a few feet, potentially in the old pole location, which seems much more acceptable.

2194
02:58:46,446 --> 02:58:50,847
And then at the same time, making sure that it meets the ADA 36-inch clearance.

2195
02:58:52,801 --> 02:59:13,108
to approve with the condition that the pole is moved to meet ADA clearance and a few feet westerly to its original location with consultation with our city engineer and the direct abutters.

2196
02:59:15,369 --> 02:59:17,090
I think that sums it up.

2197
02:59:19,365 --> 02:59:22,787
Well, what if they, um, I'd like to add something to that, Tim.

2198
02:59:22,848 --> 02:59:27,771
If they do, you know, it's like you mentioned earlier, it's, it's gotta be some reason.

2199
02:59:28,231 --> 02:59:30,053
Nobody puts a pole in the middle of the sidewalk.

2200
02:59:30,753 --> 02:59:44,363
If they do try to locate it and there's something on the ground that we don't know about, uh, can we have them give us, uh, a, um, an option of what other poles in the area may work for them?

2201
02:59:45,235 --> 02:59:53,099
Yeah, well, if that was the case, they wouldn't meet the condition and potentially wouldn't even meet, they wouldn't be able to meet the ADA clearance, so.

2202
02:59:53,779 --> 03:00:05,764
I'm thinking, you know, if they have some other, if they can, in the meantime, if that's not gonna work, have some other locations that are gonna, in the vicinity that would work, so we could, you know, maybe just save another application for coming in on that.

2203
03:00:07,265 --> 03:00:09,606
Well, I think they would have to come back, Paul.

2204
03:00:11,627 --> 03:00:14,228
Yeah, okay, but a separate application, well, but that's what you're saying.

2205
03:00:14,815 --> 03:00:33,389
or to modify the approval, but I think that what I'm hearing is that there'd be the condition Alisa suggested, which is that the poll be moved both to accomplish ADA compliance and westerly towards its original location and consultation with the poll owner, the city engineer, and the director Butters.

2206
03:00:33,889 --> 03:00:39,934
And if that can't be satisfactorily accomplished, they'll have to return to the committee to amend the approval.

2207
03:00:41,215 --> 03:00:42,376
Yeah, yeah.

2208
03:00:49,952 --> 03:00:52,274
Mr. Sylvester, is that a new hand raised?

2209
03:00:52,314 --> 03:00:53,095
If it is, you may speak.

2210
03:00:57,519 --> 03:00:58,159
Yes, it is.

2211
03:00:58,820 --> 03:00:59,380
Thank you.

2212
03:01:01,843 --> 03:01:08,669
There's a poll number five right on Brogan Road across the street.

2213
03:01:10,092 --> 03:01:11,614
Why can't they use that poll?

2214
03:01:11,995 --> 03:01:14,098
I do not, I am objecting.

2215
03:01:14,118 --> 03:01:19,205
I am getting a petition and I will be in city hall tomorrow morning with the petition.

2216
03:01:20,342 --> 03:01:25,386
We do not want that poll in front of my house with the 5G.

2217
03:01:26,026 --> 03:01:30,350
And I will call ADA tomorrow and get the poll moved immediately.

2218
03:01:31,330 --> 03:01:33,432
Please, you guys are not listening to me.

2219
03:01:33,652 --> 03:01:39,717
You're not even looking at the polls on Park Street that you asked to look at, that you wanted to put it on.

2220
03:01:40,663 --> 03:01:44,964
Okay, that one on 303 Park Street is sufficient.

2221
03:01:45,024 --> 03:01:46,165
It's a brand new pole.

2222
03:01:46,525 --> 03:01:49,286
Get Verizon to take their wires off it.

2223
03:01:49,566 --> 03:01:52,086
They're the only wires on the old pole.

2224
03:01:52,987 --> 03:01:53,987
Thank you, Mr. Silvestro.

2225
03:01:54,387 --> 03:01:55,007
Thank you very much.

2226
03:01:55,047 --> 03:01:56,068
We do hear you.

2227
03:01:56,528 --> 03:01:58,829
And that pole there, what's wrong with that pole?

2228
03:01:59,249 --> 03:02:00,789
There may be nothing wrong with that pole.

2229
03:02:00,949 --> 03:02:03,110
Mr. Silvestro, there may be nothing wrong with it.

2230
03:02:03,885 --> 03:02:08,569
The application on the table right now is for that pole in front of your house.

2231
03:02:09,009 --> 03:02:12,492
But the application was for the one across the street, Tim.

2232
03:02:13,333 --> 03:02:16,535
And they did number that one there that they denied.

2233
03:02:16,595 --> 03:02:17,756
They said they couldn't put it on.

2234
03:02:18,117 --> 03:02:21,239
This one here is perfectly fine for it.

2235
03:02:22,320 --> 03:02:26,123
The transformers on the next one in front of 53, that building is 53.

2236
03:02:27,896 --> 03:02:28,397
That pole.

2237
03:02:28,597 --> 03:02:30,800
This is 294 Park Street.

2238
03:02:31,060 --> 03:02:32,542
This pole is on Brogan Road.

2239
03:02:32,963 --> 03:02:36,187
The next pole with the transformer is the transformer to my house.

2240
03:02:36,607 --> 03:02:44,618
So every time there's lightning, that transformer goes out because they had to put that pole in when they built my house so I can have electricity.

2241
03:02:47,150 --> 03:02:48,272
That pole's sufficient.

2242
03:02:48,452 --> 03:02:50,095
The one on the other side is sufficient.

2243
03:02:50,375 --> 03:02:52,839
The one on Park Street is sufficient.

2244
03:02:53,139 --> 03:02:54,762
There's more poles on Park Street.

2245
03:02:55,002 --> 03:02:57,566
I'm the only house on that section of Brogan Road.

2246
03:02:57,927 --> 03:02:59,810
And that's the location they wanna put.

2247
03:03:00,907 --> 03:03:01,347
The poll?

2248
03:03:01,367 --> 03:03:04,149
The one right there is perfectly fine.

2249
03:03:04,609 --> 03:03:08,952
I'm gonna have them address your comment and talk about the selection of the poll.

2250
03:03:09,712 --> 03:03:14,195
It has to be denied tonight because it's not ADA compliance.

2251
03:03:14,855 --> 03:03:16,336
That is what the ruling is.

2252
03:03:16,636 --> 03:03:17,397
That's what it says.

2253
03:03:17,457 --> 03:03:19,478
That's what you already sent presidents with.

2254
03:03:19,898 --> 03:03:22,099
So that's what the vote has to be.

2255
03:03:23,560 --> 03:03:26,342
The difference is- I don't usually do my own advocating.

2256
03:03:26,382 --> 03:03:28,383
I should have just had my lawyer do this for me.

2257
03:03:29,773 --> 03:03:30,734
Thank you, Mr. Sylvester.

2258
03:03:30,774 --> 03:03:34,520
The difference between this one and the one on Winthrop Street is there wasn't a wiggle room.

2259
03:03:34,540 --> 03:03:39,307
There's no difference between this and the difference, because aesthetically, I don't like it either.

2260
03:03:39,647 --> 03:03:41,690
Sheridan Ave, I don't like it.

2261
03:03:42,531 --> 03:03:44,735
Just like they got theirs denied.

2262
03:03:46,905 --> 03:03:48,085
You rejected that one.

2263
03:03:48,426 --> 03:03:49,306
It's no different.

2264
03:03:49,326 --> 03:03:50,806
You can't continue this.

2265
03:03:50,926 --> 03:03:52,067
This is not right.

2266
03:03:52,367 --> 03:03:55,808
And to put me on the last one on the list tonight is not correct.

2267
03:03:56,248 --> 03:04:02,851
I've been on here since you guys, and the first notice I got was on March 13th.

2268
03:04:03,591 --> 03:04:06,072
I called the mayor's office for the first meeting.

2269
03:04:06,112 --> 03:04:09,073
That was the first notice I got on five properties.

2270
03:04:10,995 --> 03:04:17,724
And when they were showing the map on Sharon Street, they're putting another one right in front of my other house on Grand Ave.

2271
03:04:19,966 --> 03:04:21,729
And I will be back for that one too.

2272
03:04:22,590 --> 03:04:29,478
It's just, it's not right that you're not noticing, notifying people properly.

2273
03:04:31,174 --> 03:04:36,677
And if you're gonna make rules for certain polls, they have to be the same for all.

2274
03:04:36,817 --> 03:04:39,018
You can't deny on the same basis.

2275
03:04:39,598 --> 03:04:43,280
Verizon's attorney asked this question, why are you denying this one?

2276
03:04:43,500 --> 03:04:45,421
You approved another one, the same way.

2277
03:04:46,081 --> 03:04:48,122
We were clear on our reasoning.

2278
03:04:48,162 --> 03:04:51,104
We were clear on the reasoning on the ADA one on Winthrop Street.

2279
03:04:51,424 --> 03:04:55,646
There may be some opportunity to- Why isn't it clear on this one?

2280
03:04:55,866 --> 03:04:56,446
This is an ADA.

2281
03:05:01,310 --> 03:05:02,792
Listen, thank you very much.

2282
03:05:03,052 --> 03:05:09,057
So the one on Winthrop Street, the ADA, there was almost no flexibility to move that poll where it was.

2283
03:05:09,237 --> 03:05:12,620
It's not about flexibility to move the poll.

2284
03:05:13,140 --> 03:05:16,924
There's other polls to pick from.

2285
03:05:17,064 --> 03:05:18,365
You're picking on me now.

2286
03:05:18,865 --> 03:05:20,106
That's what you're doing.

2287
03:05:20,507 --> 03:05:21,127
Yes, you are.

2288
03:05:21,167 --> 03:05:21,988
You're picking on me.

2289
03:05:23,203 --> 03:05:26,065
And you put me on the last of the list, okay?

2290
03:05:26,445 --> 03:05:34,290
Mr. Marks asked you the last meeting that I was on hold for three hours with my hand up.

2291
03:05:35,250 --> 03:05:39,372
You took the other two people that were on there, you didn't answer me.

2292
03:05:40,133 --> 03:05:42,414
And then you adjourned the meeting, okay?

2293
03:05:42,694 --> 03:05:43,455
It's not right.

2294
03:05:44,351 --> 03:05:45,111
I apologize.

2295
03:05:45,151 --> 03:05:54,796
I didn't realize that happened, but you did speak to the public comment period and the agenda was published.

2296
03:05:54,836 --> 03:05:55,676
It's been published.

2297
03:05:56,296 --> 03:06:02,159
I, you know, I didn't to put you on last.

2298
03:06:02,379 --> 03:06:04,560
I didn't do it to spite you or anything like that.

2299
03:06:05,400 --> 03:06:09,262
We did hear you and we're going to, we're going to continue the discussion about this poll.

2300
03:06:09,982 --> 03:06:10,782
So thank you very much.

2301
03:06:10,802 --> 03:06:11,963
It has to be denied tonight.

2302
03:06:12,657 --> 03:06:14,178
Hi, hello, Tim.

2303
03:06:14,959 --> 03:06:18,782
I don't think it's up to us to find solutions for Verizon.

2304
03:06:19,503 --> 03:06:28,470
I think we are charged with on our policy on, you know, to approve or deny, and it's not ADA compliant.

2305
03:06:28,810 --> 03:06:33,594
So it's not up to us to find a solution for Verizon, that's up to them.

2306
03:06:34,214 --> 03:06:40,920
So I motion to deny on the fact that it's not ADA compliant.

2307
03:06:42,600 --> 03:06:42,760
Okay?

2308
03:06:48,583 --> 03:06:49,143
Do we hear a second?

2309
03:06:50,464 --> 03:06:50,684
Second.

2310
03:06:50,724 --> 03:06:53,246
Can I, Tim, I don't want to interrupt, but can I?

2311
03:06:53,766 --> 03:06:54,306
Yes, please do.

2312
03:06:55,307 --> 03:06:58,508
That you at least let Verizon address the questions about all our polls?

2313
03:06:59,389 --> 03:07:00,269
Oh, yeah.

2314
03:07:00,329 --> 03:07:06,152
I think, I know, I think going by our policy, it doesn't meet the policy.

2315
03:07:06,332 --> 03:07:07,813
It's not ADA compliant.

2316
03:07:09,054 --> 03:07:10,735
It's up to them to figure it out.

2317
03:07:12,242 --> 03:07:14,323
They can do that when they want to do that.

2318
03:07:14,483 --> 03:07:18,545
But I vote to deny based on that's not ADA compliant.

2319
03:07:18,585 --> 03:07:20,566
We have a motion on the floor from someone on the committee.

2320
03:07:21,246 --> 03:07:23,527
And so I will wait for a second.

2321
03:07:23,547 --> 03:07:25,348
I'll second.

2322
03:07:26,909 --> 03:07:32,471
We have a second on the motion to deny based off of not ADA compliant clearances.

2323
03:07:34,992 --> 03:07:36,033
So I'll take a roll call vote.

2324
03:07:36,093 --> 03:07:36,633
Alicia Hunt.

2325
03:07:38,794 --> 03:07:39,094
Yes.

2326
03:07:40,495 --> 03:07:41,155
Mary Ann O'Connor.

2327
03:07:45,611 --> 03:07:48,894
Oh, she can't unmute because she needs to be made co-host again.

2328
03:07:48,914 --> 03:07:49,894
Sorry, Marianne.

2329
03:07:50,895 --> 03:07:51,375
Yes.

2330
03:07:52,576 --> 03:07:53,077
Paul Moki?

2331
03:07:53,937 --> 03:07:54,217
Yes.

2332
03:07:55,959 --> 03:07:56,639
And I agree.

2333
03:07:57,100 --> 03:08:00,322
I don't believe this meets ADA compliance.

2334
03:08:00,762 --> 03:08:01,923
And I agree, Marianne.

2335
03:08:02,123 --> 03:08:07,708
It is up to Verizon to do this homework and the due diligence prior to the application.

2336
03:08:07,788 --> 03:08:08,888
So I agree.

2337
03:08:09,809 --> 03:08:10,750
So I'll vote yes as well.

2338
03:08:13,232 --> 03:08:14,392
All right.

2339
03:08:16,497 --> 03:08:17,618
That is the last one.

2340
03:08:17,918 --> 03:08:19,059
That was quite the marathon.

2341
03:08:19,099 --> 03:08:21,000
I would like to thank everybody for their patience.

2342
03:08:21,841 --> 03:08:24,663
I would like to thank everybody for the respectful tone.

2343
03:08:25,724 --> 03:08:33,169
And I would like to, you know, just acknowledge the fact that that was quite the marathon and we made the agenda.

2344
03:08:33,489 --> 03:08:33,669
So.

2345
03:08:34,770 --> 03:08:35,270
Mr. Chairman.

2346
03:08:35,931 --> 03:08:37,552
Yes, Mr. Trotsky.

2347
03:08:38,212 --> 03:08:41,595
I think we might've skipped over 71 central app.

2348
03:08:42,095 --> 03:08:42,576
You're right.

2349
03:08:43,336 --> 03:08:43,756
You're right.

2350
03:08:43,776 --> 03:08:45,838
I was just looking at that.

2351
03:08:46,783 --> 03:08:48,703
Yes, I think we did skip 71.

2352
03:08:49,243 --> 03:08:49,844
My apologies.

2353
03:08:49,864 --> 03:08:52,284
Well, I haven't closed out the hearing yet.

2354
03:08:52,324 --> 03:08:53,004
We haven't adjourned.

2355
03:08:53,384 --> 03:08:56,125
So I appreciate it, Mr. Twardowski.

2356
03:08:56,205 --> 03:09:00,186
So 71 Central Ave, it is out of order, I suppose.

2357
03:09:02,626 --> 03:09:07,287
Robin, does this present a problem that it was out of order going back?

2358
03:09:08,687 --> 03:09:09,387
No, you haven't.

2359
03:09:09,707 --> 03:09:10,828
I mean, I think it's fine.

2360
03:09:10,848 --> 03:09:11,988
You haven't closed the hearing.

2361
03:09:12,548 --> 03:09:12,688
Right.

2362
03:09:13,571 --> 03:09:15,072
Right, okay, just wanted to double check.

2363
03:09:15,112 --> 03:09:16,792
I think that makes sense.

2364
03:09:17,113 --> 03:09:18,133
Pretty reasonable stuff here.

2365
03:09:18,773 --> 03:09:19,834
All right, so let's go back to 71.

2366
03:09:20,034 --> 03:09:22,175
Hang tight a little bit longer.

2367
03:09:22,495 --> 03:09:24,215
So 71 Central Avenue.

2368
03:09:24,235 --> 03:09:25,396
So if we can go to that one.

2369
03:09:26,576 --> 03:09:28,057
Funny, I wrote, I have a note next to it.

2370
03:09:28,077 --> 03:09:41,723
I guess that note was... So if we can... Leishon, are you doing the map or should we have Amanda do it?

2371
03:09:44,570 --> 03:09:45,651
I apologize.

2372
03:09:46,871 --> 03:09:48,692
It's okay.

2373
03:09:49,292 --> 03:09:50,413
I'm dealing with something.

2374
03:09:51,133 --> 03:09:59,978
It looks like there are no lights out back, but it may just be that our lights are, and somebody came to check them and said they're on, and I said they're off.

2375
03:10:00,818 --> 03:10:01,959
Yeah.

2376
03:10:02,199 --> 03:10:06,521
It's too high.

2377
03:10:06,702 --> 03:10:11,104
71 Central Avenue, so if there are folks here to speak on that one, raise your hand.

2378
03:10:13,868 --> 03:10:21,031
My measurements for this one, three-story dwelling, 25 feet away, five-story apartment building, 95 feet away.

2379
03:10:21,051 --> 03:10:41,501
Is that it there, Alicia?

2380
03:10:42,924 --> 03:10:46,666
when you're zooming in on it.

2381
03:10:46,706 --> 03:10:51,649
It says existing street sign will be located three feet minimum from pole face.

2382
03:10:51,669 --> 03:10:59,194
That would be the snow emergency route sign.

2383
03:10:59,214 --> 03:11:08,960
The pole is 38 feet, six inches.

2384
03:11:14,413 --> 03:11:16,054
Yep, that's the one, confirmed.

2385
03:11:16,934 --> 03:11:20,516
Way above rooftop, it looks good, just the sign, but.

2386
03:11:22,296 --> 03:11:29,419
Well, that's one of the highest polls we've had too in our review, so that's up there pretty good.

2387
03:11:34,621 --> 03:11:43,505
We're considering the special condition of the sign relocation confirmed by the director of traffic.

2388
03:11:45,358 --> 03:11:51,279
Yeah, that's similar to a lot of what we've done tonight, Tim.

2389
03:11:51,299 --> 03:11:54,720
Right, it's almost like a general one, but there's not all the signs on them, so.

2390
03:11:54,760 --> 03:11:57,501
All right, so sign relocation.

2391
03:11:57,521 --> 03:12:03,182
Director of Traffic.

2392
03:12:07,203 --> 03:12:07,423
All right.

2393
03:12:10,944 --> 03:12:12,824
I don't see any hands, Amanda, any hands on this one?

2394
03:12:14,792 --> 03:12:15,273
No hands.

2395
03:12:16,694 --> 03:12:17,935
Sorry, I didn't catch that first word.

2396
03:12:18,015 --> 03:12:18,536
Was it a no already?

2397
03:12:18,556 --> 03:12:18,916
Oh, sorry.

2398
03:12:19,116 --> 03:12:19,677
No hands.

2399
03:12:26,724 --> 03:12:26,924
It's OK.

2400
03:12:26,964 --> 03:12:29,346
And we didn't hear from Dave, so I'm assuming no emails there.

2401
03:12:29,367 --> 03:12:30,608
No emails, Tim.

2402
03:12:30,628 --> 03:12:31,449
OK.

2403
03:12:33,411 --> 03:12:35,793
So discussion and or motion?

2404
03:12:37,455 --> 03:12:45,518
I'll make a motion to approve with our standard conditions and the additional condition that the relocation of the sign be approved by the director of traffic.

2405
03:12:45,538 --> 03:12:47,859
Okay, do we have a second?

2406
03:12:49,520 --> 03:12:49,880
Second.

2407
03:12:52,121 --> 03:12:52,841
And we'll call the vote.

2408
03:12:52,881 --> 03:12:53,381
Paul Moki?

2409
03:12:54,062 --> 03:12:54,322
Yes.

2410
03:12:55,442 --> 03:12:56,243
Marion O'Connor?

2411
03:12:56,743 --> 03:12:56,983
Yes.

2412
03:12:57,763 --> 03:12:58,303
Alicia Hunt?

2413
03:12:59,744 --> 03:12:59,964
No.

2414
03:13:01,705 --> 03:13:02,005
All right.

2415
03:13:02,025 --> 03:13:04,486
That does that one.

2416
03:13:04,526 --> 03:13:05,706
So, all right.

2417
03:13:06,447 --> 03:13:07,167
Do we get them all?

2418
03:13:09,502 --> 03:13:11,383
I think we got them all.

2419
03:13:12,783 --> 03:13:13,464
Thank you, everybody.

2420
03:13:13,504 --> 03:13:15,965
Now, all those things I said before still apply.

2421
03:13:16,165 --> 03:13:17,485
Thank you very much for your patience.

2422
03:13:17,545 --> 03:13:23,508
Thank you to the committee members for reviewing all the applications and coming prepared.

2423
03:13:24,808 --> 03:13:27,889
This was a lot of work for us, so definitely appreciate it.

2424
03:13:28,090 --> 03:13:30,250
And thanks to Verizon for being patient.

2425
03:13:31,791 --> 03:13:35,853
And thanks for the public for your comments and for being patient with us as well.

2426
03:13:37,404 --> 03:13:39,285
