1
00:03:43,106 --> 00:03:44,828
[SPEAKER_14]: And seven present, zero absent.

2
00:03:45,149 --> 00:03:48,473
[SPEAKER_13]: Do we have any student representatives on the call?

3
00:03:50,736 --> 00:03:51,598
[SPEAKER_13]: Student reps were invited.

4
00:03:51,618 --> 00:03:52,819
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't see them on yet.

5
00:03:52,939 --> 00:03:53,240
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

6
00:03:54,081 --> 00:03:55,563
[SPEAKER_13]: If we could all rise to salute the flag.

7
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:58,287
[SPEAKER_15]: I pledge allegiance to the flag.

8
00:04:12,355 --> 00:04:14,316
[SPEAKER_14]: Next up, we have number three, good of the order.

9
00:04:16,118 --> 00:04:18,239
[SPEAKER_13]: Would anybody like to speak under good of the order?

10
00:04:21,902 --> 00:04:24,824
[SPEAKER_13]: We have number four, consent agenda, bills and payroll.

11
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:29,540
[SPEAKER_13]: Regular school committee meeting minutes from 4-11-2022.

12
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,762
[SPEAKER_13]: Special school committee meeting minutes 4-25-2022.

13
00:04:34,502 --> 00:04:39,685
[SPEAKER_13]: Approval of two donations to McGlynn Middle School, $1,500 and 500.

14
00:04:40,545 --> 00:04:42,226
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a motion?

15
00:04:43,827 --> 00:04:46,108
[SPEAKER_20]: Motion to sever the approval of the donations.

16
00:04:46,648 --> 00:04:50,430
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion to sever approval of the donations, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

17
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:51,351
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

18
00:04:51,711 --> 00:04:52,091
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

19
00:04:52,411 --> 00:04:53,232
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

20
00:04:54,591 --> 00:04:58,932
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion is severed, so is there a motion for bills, payrolls, and the two meeting minutes?

21
00:05:01,752 --> 00:05:02,113
[SPEAKER_13]: Second.

22
00:05:02,513 --> 00:05:14,635
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion to approve the regular meeting minutes of 4-11-2022 and the school committee meeting minutes from 4-25-2022, bills and payrolls by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Kratz.

23
00:05:15,455 --> 00:05:16,295
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

24
00:05:16,836 --> 00:05:16,916
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

25
00:05:17,136 --> 00:05:17,996
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

26
00:05:18,856 --> 00:05:19,576
[SPEAKER_13]: Paper passes.

27
00:05:20,616 --> 00:05:22,417
[SPEAKER_13]: Now we have approval of two donations.

28
00:05:22,457 --> 00:05:23,377
[SPEAKER_13]: Are there any questions?

29
00:05:24,943 --> 00:05:25,704
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have any questions.

30
00:05:26,825 --> 00:05:33,971
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion to approve those two donations by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Kreatz.

31
00:05:34,651 --> 00:05:35,512
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

32
00:05:35,973 --> 00:05:36,233
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

33
00:05:36,913 --> 00:05:37,974
[SPEAKER_13]: Roll call, money, paper.

34
00:05:38,975 --> 00:05:39,536
[SPEAKER_20]: Member Graham?

35
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:40,156
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

36
00:05:40,937 --> 00:05:41,477
[SPEAKER_20]: Member Hays?

37
00:05:41,778 --> 00:05:42,038
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

38
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,000
[SPEAKER_20]: Member Kreatz?

39
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:45,100
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

40
00:05:46,422 --> 00:05:47,142
[SPEAKER_20]: Member McLaughlin?

41
00:05:47,562 --> 00:05:47,823
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

42
00:05:48,483 --> 00:05:49,164
[SPEAKER_20]: Member Mustone?

43
00:05:49,905 --> 00:05:50,125
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

44
00:05:50,885 --> 00:05:51,586
[SPEAKER_20]: Member Ruseau?

45
00:05:51,626 --> 00:05:51,886
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

46
00:05:51,966 --> 00:05:52,327
[SPEAKER_20]: Mayor Longo?

47
00:05:53,476 --> 00:05:55,539
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, seven the affirmative, zero in the negative.

48
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,302
[SPEAKER_13]: Donations are accepted.

49
00:05:58,203 --> 00:06:04,012
[SPEAKER_13]: We have a report of subcommittees, communication, and family engagement subcommittee meeting minutes 4-27-2022.

50
00:06:08,379 --> 00:06:09,319
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Graham.

51
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:16,722
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so we met last week on two topics that the committee sent to our committee in the past couple of months.

52
00:06:17,303 --> 00:06:23,305
[SPEAKER_05]: The first topic was around all the letters and communications we send as it relates to absenteeism.

53
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:30,848
[SPEAKER_05]: So part of the purpose of the meeting was to understand better what we are required to do versus what we actually do in practice.

54
00:06:31,888 --> 00:06:42,436
[SPEAKER_05]: And then to talk about whether there is a more aligned way to have those communications that is consistent with the district's goals around family engagement.

55
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:44,410
[SPEAKER_05]: and communication.

56
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:46,211
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was the first topic.

57
00:06:46,431 --> 00:06:47,451
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a good discussion.

58
00:06:47,951 --> 00:06:50,312
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple of things that I thought were worth pointing out.

59
00:06:51,012 --> 00:06:55,573
[SPEAKER_05]: We are required to send a letter once students miss a certain number of days, I believe it's 10.

60
00:06:56,293 --> 00:07:01,034
[SPEAKER_05]: As a district, we choose to send a letter at 5, 10 and 15.

61
00:07:01,994 --> 00:07:08,356
[SPEAKER_05]: And we agreed in the meeting that we would be working on some revised drafts so that those letters could be more consistent with

62
00:07:09,776 --> 00:07:22,159
[SPEAKER_05]: The notion that part of what we're doing, especially at five absences, is trying to make sure the families know that we're here, we care, we wanna work with them, we wanna understand what the challenges are so that their students can get back to learning.

63
00:07:23,059 --> 00:07:31,361
[SPEAKER_05]: Same thing at 10 is really to sort of reinforce that we're still here, we're still invested in making sure the student has what they need to be successful in school.

64
00:07:31,862 --> 00:07:37,343
[SPEAKER_05]: And then 15 being sort of that third letter with a similar touch, but obviously an escalating concern.

65
00:07:38,243 --> 00:07:39,183
[SPEAKER_05]: So we talked about that.

66
00:07:39,823 --> 00:07:52,085
[SPEAKER_05]: The administration is going to draft copies of those new letters that we will hopefully be able to get into production, into the flow of communication by next year.

67
00:07:52,105 --> 00:07:57,586
[SPEAKER_05]: And thanks to Megan Fidler-Carey, who's our Director of Family and Community Engagement.

68
00:07:57,606 --> 00:07:58,607
[SPEAKER_05]: She attended the meeting.

69
00:07:59,567 --> 00:08:06,548
[SPEAKER_05]: She talked a lot about how the work that the re-engagement specialists are doing is really aligned with some of this work that we're trying to do around

70
00:08:07,408 --> 00:08:08,409
[SPEAKER_05]: family communication.

71
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:25,287
[SPEAKER_05]: The other letter that we talked about was what I'll say is the letter that goes out at the beginning of the year, which is traditionally been penned by District Attorney Marion Ryan that talks about the requirement for students to come to school, and it goes into a fair bit of

72
00:08:26,128 --> 00:08:31,509
[SPEAKER_05]: legal conversation around what the law says about how you must send your child to school.

73
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:38,191
[SPEAKER_05]: And it does cover in some detail via a lot of legalese the consequences of not sending your child to school.

74
00:08:38,891 --> 00:08:48,873
[SPEAKER_05]: And we also agreed at that time that we would look to redraft that letter with some additional outreach to understand what the requirements are around that letter.

75
00:08:50,033 --> 00:08:53,737
[SPEAKER_05]: The reason that we'll do that is because that's the letter that goes out at the beginning of the year.

76
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:59,782
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's, you know, the first letter families should be receiving about attendance from us.

77
00:09:00,443 --> 00:09:16,677
[SPEAKER_05]: And we want to make sure that the letter actually reflects what our policies are and that the letter reflects the approach that we try to take to family and community engagement in a proactive manner rather than being focused on text from Mass General Law.

78
00:09:18,302 --> 00:09:19,886
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was topic number one.

79
00:09:19,906 --> 00:09:23,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Topic number two, the other thing we did talk about with topic number one.

80
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:30,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Although I don't see it on the agenda.

81
00:09:31,618 --> 00:09:38,201
[SPEAKER_05]: We did talk about the fact that there are five attendance policies associated with our policy handbook.

82
00:09:38,982 --> 00:09:43,924
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't see it officially on the agenda, so I will submit it officially for next week so that you all can vote on it.

83
00:09:44,004 --> 00:09:54,570
[SPEAKER_05]: But the recommendation of the subcommittee that's reflected in the minutes is that the committee will, in addition to drafting those letters, actually go through and review the attendance and truancy policies.

84
00:09:55,030 --> 00:10:02,496
[SPEAKER_05]: so that they are consistent and hopefully don't take five to actually get the point across about attendance and truancy.

85
00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:04,757
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was topic number one.

86
00:10:05,318 --> 00:10:16,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Topic number two was really covering the topic of the communication strategy, which we asked the administration for about a year and a half ago now.

87
00:10:17,046 --> 00:10:31,617
[SPEAKER_05]: That topic, they did share with us a number of updates around a new platform that they have purchased that will streamline communications so in addition to being able to more seamlessly push web content out which I think is

88
00:10:32,678 --> 00:10:45,805
[SPEAKER_05]: a huge and important part of how we improve and up our game on a website perspective, but that the tool also has the capability to streamline communications around social media, texting, potentially to replace school brains.

89
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:50,187
[SPEAKER_05]: So they are evaluating that piece of it to figure out what the implementation timing is.

90
00:10:51,528 --> 00:10:55,890
[SPEAKER_05]: And they did say they hope to give us a preview of some of the work on the website going forward.

91
00:10:56,370 --> 00:11:01,953
[SPEAKER_05]: There were lots of good questions asked about the platform versus the content.

92
00:11:02,513 --> 00:11:11,940
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think one of the things the team felt really good about is that the contract we signed for the software tool does come with support dedicated to Medford.

93
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:22,727
[SPEAKER_05]: So we will have some administrative support from the vendor that will make less lighter work of that side of the house for us that will allow us to focus on content.

94
00:11:24,621 --> 00:11:32,369
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was sort of a quick summary of the meeting and I will submit the five policies so we can officially vote on that at the next meeting.

95
00:11:36,592 --> 00:11:39,575
[SPEAKER_13]: Member McLaughlin, just your microphone, sorry.

96
00:11:39,896 --> 00:11:40,476
[SPEAKER_13]: Welcome everybody.

97
00:11:40,516 --> 00:11:43,439
[SPEAKER_13]: There's some more seats up front if you want to come on in with the little ones.

98
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:57,243
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm trying to remember between the subcommittee meetings, but did that meeting say that we needed to schedule another meeting?

99
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:58,123
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

100
00:11:58,544 --> 00:12:00,666
[SPEAKER_10]: So did we need to make a motion for that?

101
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:10,295
[SPEAKER_05]: When we ask you all to send those five policies back to us, I think that'll give us the runway to schedule a subsequent meeting about that topic.

102
00:12:12,796 --> 00:12:13,636
[SPEAKER_20]: Motion to approve the minutes?

103
00:12:13,777 --> 00:12:16,618
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion to approve by Member Ruseau, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

104
00:12:16,658 --> 00:12:17,338
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

105
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:17,939
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

106
00:12:18,059 --> 00:12:18,759
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

107
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:19,700
[SPEAKER_13]: Minutes have passed.

108
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,142
[SPEAKER_13]: Next up we have rules and policy subcommittee meeting minutes from 4-27-2022.

109
00:12:23,162 --> 00:12:23,582
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Ruseau?

110
00:12:26,018 --> 00:12:26,418
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

111
00:12:26,798 --> 00:12:32,621
[SPEAKER_20]: We met for a second time on April 27th, related to two policies that we're working on.

112
00:12:33,562 --> 00:12:38,544
[SPEAKER_20]: One was the school attorney policy, which we have renamed the committee attorney policy.

113
00:12:40,005 --> 00:12:45,887
[SPEAKER_20]: And at the next meeting, that policy will be on our agenda for us to review and hopefully approve.

114
00:12:47,288 --> 00:12:52,991
[SPEAKER_20]: There's nothing terribly exciting to say about that policy, other than the members are using our school attorney

115
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:57,070
[SPEAKER_20]: effectively and respectfully.

116
00:12:57,171 --> 00:13:00,674
[SPEAKER_20]: So it was just an update to language that looked outdated.

117
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:04,998
[SPEAKER_20]: The other thing that we're working on is the dress code policy.

118
00:13:05,598 --> 00:13:14,146
[SPEAKER_20]: And at the last meeting on the 27th of April, we unveiled a potential dress code policy.

119
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:19,531
[SPEAKER_20]: I've received a bunch of feedback from members of the community, all positive.

120
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:26,289
[SPEAKER_20]: And we're going to have one more meeting on this so that the administration and staff have a chance to really

121
00:13:27,691 --> 00:13:32,373
[SPEAKER_20]: think it through and think about what the impact of the new policy or a new policy will be.

122
00:13:33,553 --> 00:13:38,275
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not something you can just read once and imagine how it works in the day to day.

123
00:13:38,395 --> 00:13:41,436
[SPEAKER_20]: So we will be meeting again in May.

124
00:13:41,456 --> 00:13:54,641
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't have the date yet, but we're meeting again in May, hopefully to finalize this policy and send it to the full committee in the first meeting of June so we can have it ready and going for implementation in the fall.

125
00:13:55,441 --> 00:13:57,442
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's about it.

126
00:13:58,652 --> 00:13:59,353
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to approve?

127
00:14:00,535 --> 00:14:04,560
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion for approval by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Graham.

128
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,541
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

129
00:14:05,862 --> 00:14:06,222
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

130
00:14:06,282 --> 00:14:07,003
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

131
00:14:07,944 --> 00:14:08,726
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

132
00:14:10,067 --> 00:14:12,390
[SPEAKER_13]: Number six, report of the superintendent.

133
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:14,633
[SPEAKER_13]: We have superintendent's updates and comments.

134
00:14:14,693 --> 00:14:16,576
[SPEAKER_13]: Dr. Reese, Edward Vincent, our superintendent.

135
00:14:21,837 --> 00:14:22,378
[SPEAKER_19]: Good evening.

136
00:14:22,898 --> 00:14:31,948
[SPEAKER_19]: I would like to extend our thanks to Tufts University, who presented community grants to both our CCSR and Medford family network.

137
00:14:32,509 --> 00:14:38,355
[SPEAKER_19]: Each group received $2,000 for special projects so a special thank you

138
00:14:39,036 --> 00:14:51,629
[SPEAKER_19]: to Tufts University and the Medford Family Network intends to use its funding for new programs for children with autism, including adaptive swim, soccer lessons, and nature hikes.

139
00:14:52,149 --> 00:14:58,696
[SPEAKER_19]: And our CCSR students would like to do continued cleanup of our Fells reservation.

140
00:15:00,709 --> 00:15:10,112
[SPEAKER_19]: Also this weekend, we had a significant amount of volunteers come to throughout the city, but also to the Medford High School campus.

141
00:15:10,733 --> 00:15:17,875
[SPEAKER_19]: They did an outstanding job cleaning up a lot of trash and miscellaneous things that were left on our property.

142
00:15:17,915 --> 00:15:25,758
[SPEAKER_19]: And I just want to thank all of those who sent pictures and let us see the before and after shots of the work that they did this weekend.

143
00:15:27,403 --> 00:15:35,411
[SPEAKER_19]: Tonight, our Muslim families and friends are celebrating the end of Ramadan with Eid al-Fitr or breaking of the fast.

144
00:15:36,473 --> 00:15:40,977
[SPEAKER_19]: Fasting in the month of Ramadan is considered one of the five pillars of Islam.

145
00:15:41,758 --> 00:15:48,805
[SPEAKER_19]: Muslims believe that the past year sins are forgiven, good deeds are multiplied, and prayers are answered.

146
00:15:49,526 --> 00:15:58,312
[SPEAKER_19]: Eid Mubarak, which means may God flood your lives with happiness, your heart with love, your soul with spirituality, your mind with wisdom.

147
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:03,355
[SPEAKER_19]: Happy Eid to those of our community who are of Muslim faith.

148
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:15,568
[SPEAKER_19]: Also this week is Teacher Appreciation Week, and the theme this year, yes, yes, I did say that, is teaching is a work of heart.

149
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:21,353
[SPEAKER_19]: The administrators and families of Medford appreciate the dedication of our teachers.

150
00:16:22,174 --> 00:16:28,739
[SPEAKER_19]: I hope the teachers and staff enjoy the many treats the PTOs have organized for them this upcoming week.

151
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:38,303
[SPEAKER_19]: and the President of the Medford Teachers Union will be speaking this evening, and I appreciate the hard work our teachers and staff are doing.

152
00:16:39,743 --> 00:16:43,784
[SPEAKER_19]: Also, next week is Nurses Appreciation Week.

153
00:16:44,704 --> 00:16:52,807
[SPEAKER_19]: A million thanks to the nurses, our nursing staff, who have provided so much support over the course of the pandemic.

154
00:16:53,928 --> 00:17:01,951
[SPEAKER_19]: They have continued to work very hard with vaccination clinics and helping to maintain our healthy, safe community.

155
00:17:02,592 --> 00:17:04,932
[SPEAKER_19]: So thank you in advance to our nurses as well.

156
00:17:06,253 --> 00:17:07,854
[SPEAKER_19]: I want to, thank you.

157
00:17:15,481 --> 00:17:27,273
[SPEAKER_19]: Also, I want to extend special thanks to all of our administrative professionals and our principals who have had their days of appreciation last week and on yesterday.

158
00:17:27,673 --> 00:17:30,476
[SPEAKER_19]: So thank you to all of them serving our community as well.

159
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,942
[SPEAKER_19]: This weekend, some very good news to share.

160
00:17:35,362 --> 00:17:44,926
[SPEAKER_19]: Our robotics students, with guidance from teacher Sam Christie, participated in the New England Robotics Championship and won.

161
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:52,830
[SPEAKER_19]: They are now eligible to compete in the National Championship in Long Beach, California later this month.

162
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:59,773
[SPEAKER_19]: It's simply fabulous news, and we're very proud of our engineering and robotics students.

163
00:18:00,832 --> 00:18:02,180

00:18:18,063 --> 00:18:27,730
[SPEAKER_19]: The orchestra came in first with an overall rating of excellent, and the marching band came in first with an overall rating of superior.

167
00:18:28,351 --> 00:18:29,912
[SPEAKER_19]: This is a great accomplishment.

168
00:18:30,352 --> 00:18:32,894
[SPEAKER_19]: Congratulations to our musical Mustangs.

169
00:18:42,498 --> 00:18:52,403
[SPEAKER_19]: Lastly, we extend our congratulations to senior Connor Finnegan, who scored 10 goals as a member of the boys lacrosse team.

170
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:58,986
[SPEAKER_19]: This is the most goals ever scored by one lacrosse player in Mustang history.

171
00:18:59,846 --> 00:19:03,268
[SPEAKER_19]: As the Mustangs beat Malden 19 to zero.

172
00:19:04,088 --> 00:19:08,771
[SPEAKER_19]: The Mustangs are now nine and two and just became the GBL champs.

173
00:19:09,351 --> 00:19:11,332
[SPEAKER_19]: Congratulations boys lacrosse team.

174
00:19:18,135 --> 00:19:31,227
[SPEAKER_19]: Also, I am happy to share that our community is bustling and hosting more and more in-person events, including concerts, plays, and award ceremonies over the course of the next few weeks.

175
00:19:32,048 --> 00:19:40,775
[SPEAKER_19]: In particular, during the week of May 9th to the 13th, we will be hosting open houses for kindergartners and middle schoolers.

176
00:19:41,636 --> 00:19:51,203
[SPEAKER_19]: So on Tuesday, May 10th, McGlynn Middle School open house for rising sixth graders from six to 8 p.m.

177
00:19:51,923 --> 00:19:57,407

[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

185
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:31,224
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you very much.

186
00:20:31,804 --> 00:20:40,149
[SPEAKER_20]: I just have a quick question about the robotics finals or nationals are we covering all of the costs associated with those with the team going.

187
00:20:41,047 --> 00:20:43,428
[SPEAKER_19]: So I, this is like so hot off the press.

188
00:20:43,488 --> 00:20:45,868
[SPEAKER_19]: We got the information this afternoon.

189
00:20:45,908 --> 00:20:55,371
[SPEAKER_19]: So I don't have the specifics yet for the total number of students that will be eligible to travel.

190
00:20:55,391 --> 00:20:58,812
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't have the specifics, but I thought it was such great news.

191
00:20:58,852 --> 00:21:00,232
[SPEAKER_19]: I just wanted to get it out there.

192
00:21:00,652 --> 00:21:05,354
[SPEAKER_19]: But as soon as I get additional information, I'll be willing to share it with you.

193
00:21:05,534 --> 00:21:05,734
[SPEAKER_19]: Great.

194
00:21:05,754 --> 00:21:06,194
[SPEAKER_19]: That'd be great.

195
00:21:06,254 --> 00:21:06,814
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

196
00:21:07,814 --> 00:21:08,114
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

197
00:21:08,975 --> 00:21:09,395
[SPEAKER_13]: One more time.

198
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:10,315
[SPEAKER_13]: I know there's people out in the,

199
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:12,508
[SPEAKER_13]: You wanna come in and there's seats in the front row.

200
00:21:12,528 --> 00:21:13,649
[SPEAKER_13]: I know there's, I see some.

201
00:21:15,409 --> 00:21:15,709
[SPEAKER_13]: You good?

202
00:21:15,909 --> 00:21:16,649
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

203
00:21:16,669 --> 00:21:16,869
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

204
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:20,630
[SPEAKER_13]: I know you can't hear out there, so I feel, I wanna make sure everybody can hear.

205
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:24,471
[SPEAKER_13]: Number two, we have report on unified sports and adaptive physical education.

206
00:21:24,551 --> 00:21:24,731
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

207
00:21:24,771 --> 00:21:27,232
[SPEAKER_13]: Joan Bowen, director of pupil services, Ms.

208
00:21:27,372 --> 00:21:34,514
[SPEAKER_13]: Rachel Perry, director of physical education and health education, and Carla Andre, adaptive physical education teacher.

209
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:36,154
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

210
00:21:39,104 --> 00:21:41,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening, Mayor and members of the school committee.

211
00:21:41,707 --> 00:21:52,813
[SPEAKER_03]: Tonight, I'm joined by Rachel Perry and Carla Andre to present an update regarding two programs that were implemented during this school year, adaptive physical education and unified sports.

212
00:21:53,333 --> 00:22:08,741
[SPEAKER_03]: We would like to thank the school committee and once again, express our appreciation to the committee for prioritizing and supporting both these initiatives, which have greatly contributed to meaningful inclusionary experiences for our most vulnerable population.

213
00:22:08,821 --> 00:22:09,581
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you again.

214
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:15,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks like I really drew a crowd tonight.

215
00:22:17,188 --> 00:22:20,290
[SPEAKER_04]: This is going to be the best part of your night, I promise.

216
00:22:21,151 --> 00:22:21,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

217
00:22:44,707 --> 00:22:45,348
[SPEAKER_14]: Dr. Cushy.

218
00:22:46,389 --> 00:22:46,709
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

219
00:22:50,072 --> 00:22:50,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

220
00:22:51,033 --> 00:22:58,000
[SPEAKER_04]: So tonight I'm here to talk to you about adapted physical education, a program that we rolled out this year, as well as unified sports in Medford.

221
00:22:58,421 --> 00:23:00,903
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to start with the adapted physical education piece.

222
00:23:00,923 --> 00:23:02,425
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is an end of the year update.

223
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,002
[SPEAKER_04]: So just the hard data and numbers.

224
00:23:07,182 --> 00:23:14,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Initially, when I first met with you and presented this in front of all of you at the beginning of the year, we had about 70 to 80 referrals, which is a huge number.

225
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:24,299
[SPEAKER_04]: So between physical education teachers, special education teachers, we felt, you know, these are all the recommendations, these are the numbers that were given to me.

226
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,020
[SPEAKER_04]: After I went in,

227
00:23:26,981 --> 00:23:43,798
[SPEAKER_04]: And I got to look at the population and determine eligibility, the numbers, more around 40 right now that's, you know, it will only grow from here but currently this year we're at about 40 students who require adapted physical education to access the physical education curriculum.

228
00:23:45,018 --> 00:23:53,322
[SPEAKER_04]: The other two numbers are, we have, the numbers are actually updated as of today, even as IEPs are signed and they come in, that number goes up.

229
00:23:53,742 --> 00:23:59,385
[SPEAKER_04]: So what that means is I'm waiting for 28 IEPs to be signed and come back to me.

230
00:23:59,685 --> 00:24:03,887
[SPEAKER_04]: And we already have 12 that are established and students are being serviced.

231
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:15,443
[SPEAKER_04]: And then just to refresh about the process, not every student requires adaptive physical education, not every student gets it because we think they might benefit from it.

232
00:24:15,483 --> 00:24:16,783
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a process to it.

233
00:24:17,503 --> 00:24:23,045
[SPEAKER_04]: So first I determined qualification, meaning does the student already have an established disability?

234
00:24:23,565 --> 00:24:25,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Is the student already on an IEP?

235
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:30,187
[SPEAKER_04]: Once I observed the student, we sent out a parent consent working with the ETLs.

236
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:33,788
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I went in and did a formal or an informal assessment.

237
00:24:34,608 --> 00:24:38,411
[SPEAKER_04]: I met with the parent to review the assessment, and then I added the service to the IEP.

238
00:24:39,252 --> 00:24:44,437
[SPEAKER_04]: And then just to note that all purchases were made within the physical education budget.

239
00:24:46,258 --> 00:24:46,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Next slide.

240
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:54,525
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the formal assessment that Rachel and I talked about, and we decided this would be best for our population to use.

241
00:24:54,625 --> 00:25:00,991
[SPEAKER_04]: So it is the Adapted Physical Education Assessment Scale, and it is elementary and secondary specific.

242
00:25:03,334 --> 00:25:03,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Next slide.

243
00:25:04,215 --> 00:25:05,416
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is just an example.

244
00:25:05,456 --> 00:25:06,497
[SPEAKER_04]: There are two parts to it.

245
00:25:06,637 --> 00:25:13,262
[SPEAKER_04]: The first part being, you know, very physical, so motor, object control, locomotor skills, physical fitness.

246
00:25:13,823 --> 00:25:17,246
[SPEAKER_04]: But then there's a second part that's really important, and you can go to the next slide.

247
00:25:18,246 --> 00:25:28,475
[SPEAKER_04]: This is more about the cognitive ability, participation, if there's any medical restrictions or behavior restrictions that prevent a student from participating in gen ed physical education.

248
00:25:31,331 --> 00:25:33,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Next slide.

249
00:25:33,773 --> 00:25:42,078
[SPEAKER_04]: So how I ran the program is that I did units and I lined it up with the curriculum and the standards that were given to me by the physical education department.

250
00:25:42,138 --> 00:25:51,504
[SPEAKER_04]: So for example, if third grade in the month of November, they were working on baseball skills, throwing, hitting an object with a bat.

251
00:25:52,464 --> 00:25:55,807
[SPEAKER_04]: We did that in adaptive physical education, small group classes as well.

252
00:25:56,707 --> 00:26:04,454
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's to bridge the gap and to eventually get these students into inclusion, you know, if that if that is an opportunity for them.

253
00:26:06,015 --> 00:26:07,056
[SPEAKER_04]: You can go to the next slide.

254
00:26:10,579 --> 00:26:11,800
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are just some examples.

255
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,462
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is just a visual board that I would use with my students.

256
00:26:15,515 --> 00:26:25,181
[SPEAKER_04]: and you would see standards and the objective, the activity, PE and gym rules, you'll see that hanging in any gym across the district that you walk into.

257
00:26:25,421 --> 00:26:27,743
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I travel, my board travels with me.

258
00:26:30,184 --> 00:26:32,366
[SPEAKER_04]: And the next couple of slides, you can go through them.

259
00:26:32,946 --> 00:26:36,328
[SPEAKER_04]: Students' faces are blocked out for privacy, but these are just some examples.

260
00:26:37,089 --> 00:26:43,933
[SPEAKER_04]: You see we have soccer, hockey, baseball, covered every sport that the other schools were doing.

261
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:50,172
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can go to the next slide.

262
00:26:50,592 --> 00:26:54,036
[SPEAKER_04]: And we are going to switch gears to Medford unified sports.

263
00:26:55,017 --> 00:26:56,318
[SPEAKER_04]: So this, this is separate.

264
00:26:56,358 --> 00:26:57,840
[SPEAKER_04]: This is an extracurricular activity.

265
00:27:00,265 --> 00:27:02,445
[SPEAKER_04]: We rolled out three sports this year.

266
00:27:02,505 --> 00:27:06,346
[SPEAKER_04]: So we started with unified basketball at the high school level, which was a huge success.

267
00:27:06,726 --> 00:27:14,988
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want to thank many of you that came out, um, you know, the faculty as well, we had so much support and the students really felt that, and it was just a beautiful thing.

268
00:27:15,068 --> 00:27:19,709
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, I felt that it was really successful for our very first season of it ever.

269
00:27:19,729 --> 00:27:25,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, this is not unified is something that Massachusetts has been doing for several years.

270
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:29,791
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just our first year participating in it, um, at the high school level.

271
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:32,511
[SPEAKER_04]: You can go to the next slide.

272
00:27:34,673 --> 00:27:38,937
[SPEAKER_04]: So here are the numbers we were at capacity for our basketball, we had a huge interest.

273
00:27:40,278 --> 00:27:42,340
[SPEAKER_04]: 16 is kind of a lot for a basketball team.

274
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:46,444
[SPEAKER_04]: So in the years to come, if we have double the interest, we're going to make two teams.

275
00:27:47,244 --> 00:27:50,767
[SPEAKER_04]: So for high school basketball, we played other districts in our area.

276
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:54,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we did middle school basketball.

277
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:59,553
[SPEAKER_04]: It was supposed to be kind of the same idea where we would play other middle schools in our area.

278
00:28:00,433 --> 00:28:03,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Other districts didn't feel that they were ready for it.

279
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:05,777
[SPEAKER_04]: We felt that we were, so we put it out there.

280
00:28:06,737 --> 00:28:13,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, we weren't able to play other schools because we didn't have the participation from surrounding cities, so we had a clinic.

281
00:28:13,341 --> 00:28:19,165
[SPEAKER_04]: We hit capacity on that huge interest, and we're hoping that next year we'll be able to travel and play other cities.

282
00:28:20,819 --> 00:28:28,265
[SPEAKER_04]: And then lastly we did high school track and field that is actually ongoing right now we have about 15 participants in that as well, which is, which is a good number.

283
00:28:31,181 --> 00:28:33,082
[SPEAKER_04]: So Special Olympics provides a stipend.

284
00:28:34,083 --> 00:28:37,704
[SPEAKER_04]: They make the schedule and they choose the sports that are currently being offered.

285
00:28:37,744 --> 00:28:45,888
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've gotten a lot of feedback on recommendations for different sports and could we try unified volleyball or hockey or things like that.

286
00:28:46,489 --> 00:28:49,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Special Olympics does fund that and they do provide the sport.

287
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:55,333
[SPEAKER_04]: So as of right now, it is only basketball, track and field, and I think bocce that, yeah, we're not in that quite yet.

288
00:28:57,785 --> 00:28:59,767
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are just some highlights some pictures.

289
00:29:01,289 --> 00:29:09,397
[SPEAKER_04]: You can skip down to the last slide and I think just the best way to wrap it up is to play this highlight video it's a two minute long video and that will wrap up our presentation.

290
00:30:05,256 --> 00:30:05,577
you.

291
00:30:41,701 --> 00:30:42,326
Thank you.

292
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,481
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for the presentation member McLaughlin.

293
00:31:33,921 --> 00:31:37,863
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, thank you for the presentation and it was just a beautiful thing really does sum it up.

294
00:31:37,903 --> 00:31:40,324
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a great two programs.

295
00:31:40,364 --> 00:31:42,805
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much for Carla and Rachel.

296
00:31:42,825 --> 00:31:44,786
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that this has been a dream of yours for a long time.

297
00:31:44,846 --> 00:31:44,946
[SPEAKER_10]: So

298
00:31:45,444 --> 00:31:47,686
[SPEAKER_10]: It's so nice to see it actually come to fruition.

299
00:31:47,746 --> 00:31:50,348
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think it's such a good thing for our community.

300
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:52,209
[SPEAKER_10]: And I did have just a couple of questions.

301
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:58,635
[SPEAKER_10]: Were there any students that, I know you said that you were at capacity for, I think, the high school.

302
00:31:59,075 --> 00:32:04,137
[SPEAKER_10]: So were there any students, this is for the unified, were there any students that you had to turn away or?

303
00:32:04,458 --> 00:32:07,479
[SPEAKER_04]: So for the high school team, we took all 16 that were interested.

304
00:32:07,539 --> 00:32:09,340
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a big number for a basketball team.

305
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,461
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wanted everyone to be able to participate.

306
00:32:12,481 --> 00:32:15,703
[SPEAKER_04]: I think in the future, we'll think about having two teams.

307
00:32:16,023 --> 00:32:22,686
[SPEAKER_04]: And then for the middle school clinic, the capacity was 30, just because we did, you know, the gym is only so big.

308
00:32:23,726 --> 00:32:25,287
[SPEAKER_04]: And I did have a wait list for that.

309
00:32:26,328 --> 00:32:26,608
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

310
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:32,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, because of the gym, just because of the space, more than 30 kids.

311
00:32:32,291 --> 00:32:32,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

312
00:32:32,831 --> 00:32:35,553
[SPEAKER_04]: It just wouldn't have, um, yeah, it wouldn't have worked as well.

313
00:32:36,334 --> 00:32:36,674
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

314
00:32:36,874 --> 00:32:39,135
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was able to come to some of those and they were beautiful.

315
00:32:39,215 --> 00:32:39,916
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much.

316
00:32:39,956 --> 00:32:49,922
[SPEAKER_10]: And also the football team I saw at some of the games and I think what was really remarkable to see the unique and natural friendships that were evolving during the team and people feeling like they really belonged.

317
00:32:49,982 --> 00:32:52,283
[SPEAKER_10]: And that was something really special to see.

318
00:32:53,196 --> 00:32:58,557
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I also just wanted to ask about other staff that were involved, because I know that there were a lot of other staff there, and I just want to make sure that we recognize them.

319
00:32:58,577 --> 00:32:59,537
[SPEAKER_04]: There were other staff.

320
00:32:59,557 --> 00:33:05,879
[SPEAKER_04]: John Skerry helped me out quite a bit on really all aspects, basketball, and he's helping me with track and field right now.

321
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:09,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Nicole Sylvester, who's a special education teacher, she was my assistant as well.

322
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:14,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Michael McLaughlin came out to a lot and showed his support, and he really helped me out.

323
00:33:14,321 --> 00:33:19,762
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to think if I missed, David Richard was a coach for our middle school basketball clinic.

324
00:33:19,802 --> 00:33:20,602
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I missing anybody?

325
00:33:21,769 --> 00:33:25,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Denise Desjardins was helping, out of the goodness of her own heart, she was volunteering.

326
00:33:25,614 --> 00:33:27,717
[SPEAKER_04]: So we did have a couple of volunteers as well.

327
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:29,319
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're really thankful for that.

328
00:33:29,339 --> 00:33:30,721
[SPEAKER_10]: Cindy Griffin came and volunteered.

329
00:33:30,761 --> 00:33:31,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, as well as Cindy.

330
00:33:32,463 --> 00:33:35,287
[SPEAKER_04]: But it, you know, it takes volunteers as well.

331
00:33:35,367 --> 00:33:38,332
[SPEAKER_04]: So if anybody's ever interested, it's a really beautiful thing to be a part of.

332
00:33:38,732 --> 00:33:40,293
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, the high school volunteers.

333
00:33:40,894 --> 00:33:42,475
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, student had a yeah, that's right.

334
00:33:42,495 --> 00:33:43,916
[SPEAKER_04]: A high school.

335
00:33:44,177 --> 00:33:48,380
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, with unified, we want to make sure that it's really authentic friendship.

336
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:51,483
[SPEAKER_04]: So we don't want high school volunteering for the high school level.

337
00:33:51,523 --> 00:33:55,586
[SPEAKER_04]: So they volunteered for the middle school level, because that's, you know, that's the students are older.

338
00:33:56,147 --> 00:33:58,369
[SPEAKER_04]: So the volunteers would definitely be different ages.

339
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:01,798
[SPEAKER_10]: it's been really thoughtful in terms of the way that you've put it together.

340
00:34:01,858 --> 00:34:09,041
[SPEAKER_10]: So I, I, as a parent of a child with an intellectual and developmental disability, especially appreciate and can see the uniqueness of the way that you put it together.

341
00:34:09,081 --> 00:34:12,722
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you very, very much for that and for being so inclusive.

342
00:34:12,902 --> 00:34:17,784
[SPEAKER_10]: And there was one other thing that I did have to ask was, oh, and I also think you're setting a trend in the community.

343
00:34:17,844 --> 00:34:22,666
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, the there's a theater program now that's an adaptive theater program.

344
00:34:22,706 --> 00:34:24,847
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think it's part of the trend that you guys are setting.

345
00:34:24,907 --> 00:34:26,547
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just wanted to say, thank you for that.

346
00:34:28,568 --> 00:34:28,808
[SPEAKER_13]: Awesome.

347
00:34:29,878 --> 00:34:30,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham.

348
00:34:31,698 --> 00:34:32,379
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for this.

349
00:34:32,499 --> 00:34:33,059
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree with you.

350
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:35,419
[SPEAKER_05]: This is probably going to be the most fun we have tonight.

351
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,240
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

352
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:47,323
[SPEAKER_05]: I recall that in last year's budget, we added staff to support the adaptive PE.

353
00:34:47,383 --> 00:34:48,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that correct?

354
00:34:49,203 --> 00:34:52,564
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it half an FTE or a full FTE?

355
00:34:52,624 --> 00:34:53,624
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just trying to remember.

356
00:34:54,745 --> 00:34:55,845
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, that was one of

357
00:34:57,108 --> 00:34:58,489
[SPEAKER_11]: FTE and that was Carla's position.

358
00:34:58,709 --> 00:35:00,029
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so she's won full time.

359
00:35:00,309 --> 00:35:09,553
[SPEAKER_05]: And based on this first year and all the IEPs that you're moving through, and I know you said you anticipate the program to grow, do you

360
00:35:10,632 --> 00:35:21,958
[SPEAKER_05]: do you anticipate that you will need the school committee to respond with additional staff at this year, next year, sometime soon, or we think we're in like a level space?

361
00:35:22,238 --> 00:35:27,741
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think we'll need any within the next couple of years going forward possibly, but as of right now, I think we're good.

362
00:35:27,761 --> 00:35:28,582
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

363
00:35:29,122 --> 00:35:29,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

364
00:35:29,382 --> 00:35:29,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

365
00:35:29,802 --> 00:35:30,083
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

366
00:35:33,607 --> 00:35:34,868
[SPEAKER_13]: Member McLaughlin and Dr. Benson.

367
00:35:35,088 --> 00:35:39,411
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I just had one other question, because thank you to the chair, member Graham, about the budget.

368
00:35:39,451 --> 00:35:53,741
[SPEAKER_10]: I also wanted to ask about, I know that you said that the purchases for AP were in the PE budget, and I was wondering if that was, did that take up a lot of cost, or is there anything that we need to know about additional cost for things that you folks might need?

369
00:35:53,781 --> 00:35:58,725
[SPEAKER_10]: And I also just want to say simple things just make a huge difference, too, that I noticed in the picture.

370
00:35:58,765 --> 00:36:02,948
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you for the Velcro, and just some simple things that can be done, some low-tech things.

371
00:36:03,887 --> 00:36:05,789
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there additional need?

372
00:36:06,709 --> 00:36:09,051
[SPEAKER_11]: Right now, we're not gonna ask for anything more in the budget.

373
00:36:09,071 --> 00:36:15,615
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we've purchased what we need for this year and Carl has done a phenomenal job of using some of the equipment we already have and adapting that.

374
00:36:15,795 --> 00:36:17,937
[SPEAKER_11]: So at this point, we don't need anything else.

375
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:24,803
[SPEAKER_10]: Miss Andre, were you saying something about some of the adaptive equipment too, perhaps through other programming or?

376
00:36:25,424 --> 00:36:25,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

377
00:36:26,665 --> 00:36:46,481
[SPEAKER_04]: So I obviously have a lot of ideas that I'm not going to put out right now, but ultimately, hopefully we can use our own resources, maybe in the vocational school that we have to just, you know, make low tech equipment for, and that would kind of be a natural way of, you know, education and awareness, disability awareness kind of built right in.

378
00:36:46,501 --> 00:36:46,541
[SPEAKER_04]: So,

379
00:36:47,242 --> 00:36:50,024
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just something for the future and where I want to go with this.

380
00:36:50,764 --> 00:36:50,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

381
00:36:51,605 --> 00:36:51,945
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

382
00:36:52,205 --> 00:36:53,466
[SPEAKER_10]: You have a lot of great ideas.

383
00:36:53,506 --> 00:36:53,826
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

384
00:36:54,226 --> 00:36:55,587
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Dr. Edwardson.

385
00:36:55,867 --> 00:36:57,368
[SPEAKER_19]: I just wanted to say thank you.

386
00:36:57,748 --> 00:37:12,237
[SPEAKER_19]: I had the opportunity to definitely go and participate and observe the basketball games, and it was absolutely wonderful seeing students working together, playing together, cheering on each other.

387
00:37:13,277 --> 00:37:20,101
[SPEAKER_19]: Even the parents, I want to thank all the parents who were so actively involved because we cheered for all the students, no matter what side scored.

388
00:37:20,801 --> 00:37:25,203
[SPEAKER_19]: And so it was definitely a different way to think about sports.

389
00:37:25,663 --> 00:37:31,366
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think it brought so many students, families in our community together in a different way.

390
00:37:31,466 --> 00:37:32,307
[SPEAKER_19]: So just thank you for

391
00:37:32,947 --> 00:37:39,132
[SPEAKER_19]: taking that extra challenge on and the unified sports were, it was absolutely fabulous.

392
00:37:39,592 --> 00:37:45,256
[SPEAKER_19]: And the video and the pictures from what's been happening in Adaptive PE was also excellent.

393
00:37:45,296 --> 00:37:46,077
[SPEAKER_19]: So thank you for that.

394
00:37:47,978 --> 00:37:48,419
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

395
00:37:48,539 --> 00:37:48,919
[SPEAKER_13]: Question.

396
00:37:49,579 --> 00:37:50,100
[SPEAKER_13]: One question.

397
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:51,281
[SPEAKER_13]: Miss Andre.

398
00:37:51,561 --> 00:37:52,301
[SPEAKER_13]: Miss Andre.

399
00:37:53,022 --> 00:37:53,723
[SPEAKER_13]: Miss Andre.

400
00:37:53,923 --> 00:37:54,183
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

401
00:37:56,381 --> 00:37:56,801
[SPEAKER_13]: Just Ms.

402
00:37:56,882 --> 00:38:03,026
[SPEAKER_13]: Andre, when should we expect the final, like the big race for track and field, or do you already have it?

403
00:38:06,949 --> 00:38:07,369
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, okay.

404
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:09,390
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, good luck.

405
00:38:15,034 --> 00:38:18,777
[SPEAKER_13]: Number three, we have recommendation to approve Medford as a no school choice district.

406
00:38:18,817 --> 00:38:20,518
[SPEAKER_13]: Dr. Maurice Edward Vincent, superintendent.

407
00:38:22,493 --> 00:38:23,534
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

408
00:38:24,815 --> 00:38:41,233
[SPEAKER_19]: Every year we have to report to Desi and take an official vote and so I'm coming before you, your body this evening again, asking that Medford continue to maintain their status as a no school choice district.

409
00:38:42,134 --> 00:38:45,736
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm asking for your support with this.

410
00:38:46,996 --> 00:38:53,919
[SPEAKER_19]: Medford has a lot of diversity of population and students here.

411
00:38:54,539 --> 00:39:00,001
[SPEAKER_19]: And I feel that we truly are doing the best we can do to service our current community.

412
00:39:00,602 --> 00:39:06,124
[SPEAKER_19]: And so my recommendation would be that we remain a no school choice district.

413
00:39:09,105 --> 00:39:09,385
[SPEAKER_13]: May I?

414
00:39:09,885 --> 00:39:11,046
[SPEAKER_13]: Member McLaughlin and Member Ruseau.

415
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:15,173
[SPEAKER_10]: Would you mind if we just have a brief explanation of what that is?

416
00:39:15,233 --> 00:39:20,507
[SPEAKER_10]: So for folks who are watching that don't know what that means, maybe just two lines or something.

417
00:39:21,845 --> 00:39:32,009
[SPEAKER_19]: When you're a school choice district, you receive other, you're able to receive students from other communities and other districts.

418
00:39:32,969 --> 00:39:43,333
[SPEAKER_19]: And there are a lot of some districts that are school choice districts, but I think with the complexities that we have here in Medford, our current population.

419
00:39:45,734 --> 00:39:52,956
[SPEAKER_19]: We have, I feel that we definitely have our hands for servicing the population that we have.

420
00:39:53,476 --> 00:39:55,737
[SPEAKER_19]: And when you're a school choice district.

421
00:39:57,657 --> 00:40:01,938
[SPEAKER_19]: You're not able to pick some students and not pick others.

422
00:40:02,298 --> 00:40:04,659
[SPEAKER_19]: So once you have that status.

423
00:40:06,055 --> 00:40:13,938
[SPEAKER_19]: people are welcome to apply, and you don't always know what may happen.

424
00:40:14,098 --> 00:40:21,140
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think just for where we are as a district, it is not in our best interests to become a school choice district at this point in time.

425
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:30,963
[SPEAKER_19]: Every year I have to bring it before your body, but I would kindly request that you support the fact that we're a no school choice district.

426
00:40:32,804 --> 00:40:33,104
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

427
00:40:33,704 --> 00:40:34,064
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Ruseau?

428
00:40:36,479 --> 00:40:37,580
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's just gonna do the roll call.

429
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,280
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion for approval.

430
00:40:38,501 --> 00:40:39,721
[SPEAKER_20]: Motion for approval, yes, sorry.

431
00:40:39,741 --> 00:40:43,944
[SPEAKER_13]: Seconded by member Ruseau, motion for approval, seconded by member McLaughlin, roll call vote.

432
00:40:45,505 --> 00:40:45,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

433
00:40:47,046 --> 00:40:47,386
[SPEAKER_20]: Member Hays.

434
00:40:47,426 --> 00:40:47,506
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

435
00:40:48,667 --> 00:40:49,207
[SPEAKER_20]: Member Kreatz.

436
00:40:49,527 --> 00:40:49,748
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

437
00:40:50,488 --> 00:40:51,249
[SPEAKER_20]: Member McLaughlin.

438
00:40:51,509 --> 00:40:52,029
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

439
00:40:52,069 --> 00:40:52,789
[SPEAKER_20]: Member Mustone.

440
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:53,110
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

441
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:54,410
[SPEAKER_20]: Member Ruseau, yes.

442
00:40:54,471 --> 00:40:55,211
[SPEAKER_20]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn.

443
00:40:55,691 --> 00:40:58,293
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, 70 affirmative, zero in the negative, paper passes.

444
00:40:58,933 --> 00:41:01,355
[SPEAKER_13]: Number four, report on McGlynn playground inspections.

445
00:41:01,475 --> 00:41:04,877
[SPEAKER_13]: Dr. Peter Cushing, assistant superintendent of secondary education.

446
00:41:06,072 --> 00:41:06,552
[SPEAKER_14]: Dr. Cushing.

447
00:41:13,974 --> 00:41:19,816
[SPEAKER_17]: Good evening, Madam Mayor, School Committee, our esteemed faculty and staff, and members of the public gathered here this evening.

448
00:41:20,737 --> 00:41:24,618
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to take this time to address two motions on the October 4th

449
00:41:25,922 --> 00:41:27,823
[SPEAKER_17]: school committee agenda that were made.

450
00:41:27,863 --> 00:41:41,966
[SPEAKER_17]: The first was offered by member Rousseau, whereas the McLean playground continues to be in a substandard condition and the standing water has been an issue there and concern around mosquito-borne illnesses.

451
00:41:42,087 --> 00:41:50,789
[SPEAKER_17]: An update was requested on the project and a request will be made to the mayor, to the DPW to clear standing water at the playground whenever standing water is present.

452
00:41:51,449 --> 00:42:10,656
[SPEAKER_17]: Over the past several months, the DPW has cleared the water at least twice that I know of, and they have actually worked, the new head of the DPW has worked to establish a plan to replace and retrofit the failing French drain.

453
00:42:10,876 --> 00:42:17,939
[SPEAKER_17]: The French drain system surrounds the backside of the playground and drains water away to various culverts in the area.

454
00:42:18,789 --> 00:42:25,890
[SPEAKER_17]: The French drain is a plastic corrugated pipe, as best we can tell, and numerous of the junction boxes have also failed.

455
00:42:26,485 --> 00:42:33,210
[SPEAKER_17]: About 50% of the pipe failed, and the area has been marked by Dig Safe.

456
00:42:34,151 --> 00:42:53,205
[SPEAKER_17]: And the last thing that we were waiting for, the DPW was actually hoping to conclude the project over April vacation, but the report that I have said that the gas company did not respond to the request to mark the area, so shovels could not go in the ground.

457
00:42:53,305 --> 00:42:55,627
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're currently on hold waiting for that.

458
00:42:56,147 --> 00:43:00,993
[SPEAKER_17]: The DPW has been responsive when standing water is there to pump it out.

459
00:43:02,535 --> 00:43:11,606
[SPEAKER_17]: And that standing water is, we'll get to it in the report, but that standing water is actually a area of concern beyond mosquito borne illnesses.

460
00:43:12,045 --> 00:43:21,853
[SPEAKER_17]: but for the overall viability of the playground itself and its long-term, you know, when we shift to a new playground, its long-term goals.

461
00:43:22,533 --> 00:43:25,276
[SPEAKER_17]: We have gone through a process.

462
00:43:25,376 --> 00:43:34,083
[SPEAKER_17]: There are several people who have been on a steering committee with me to work on selecting one of the city's pre-approved vendors.

463
00:43:34,736 --> 00:43:36,277
[SPEAKER_17]: There are three pre-approved vendors.

464
00:43:36,497 --> 00:43:43,883
[SPEAKER_17]: Two of the vendors chose to submit financial requests, RFPs, for this project.

465
00:43:44,804 --> 00:43:47,666
[SPEAKER_17]: The successful candidate was Copley-Wolf Design Group.

466
00:43:48,767 --> 00:43:57,634
[SPEAKER_17]: They were selected because of their extreme willingness to get this right as a universally accessible playground.

467
00:43:58,474 --> 00:43:59,655
[SPEAKER_17]: That's where I'd like to really start.

468
00:43:59,675 --> 00:44:02,798
[SPEAKER_17]: This connects in with what Carla was talking about.

469
00:44:03,239 --> 00:44:18,093
[SPEAKER_17]: A universally accessible playground is going to provide play structures and play opportunities for all of our students at the McGlynn Playground that are at their cognitive, physical, and any other ability level possible.

470
00:44:18,854 --> 00:44:20,255
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, why is this important?

471
00:44:20,796 --> 00:44:21,677
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, right now,

472
00:44:23,019 --> 00:44:25,220
[SPEAKER_17]: The playground has none of that.

473
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:26,120
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

474
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:40,144
[SPEAKER_17]: And as a matter of fact, it looks as our CPSI certified playground safety inspector said, it looks great from afar, but it really has no fun to it.

475
00:44:41,104 --> 00:44:47,186
[SPEAKER_17]: Kids will run, kids will jump, but as far as engaging games, engaging activities,

476
00:44:48,158 --> 00:44:53,152
[SPEAKER_17]: and other opportunities for play supported by a structure, it doesn't really exist.

477
00:44:53,905 --> 00:45:00,071
[SPEAKER_17]: The playground is the city's largest playground for schools at about 25,000 square feet.

478
00:45:00,551 --> 00:45:01,932
[SPEAKER_17]: It has two play structures.

479
00:45:02,773 --> 00:45:09,980
[SPEAKER_17]: Both, it appears, because there's no signage, both, it appears, are for grades ages five to 12.

480
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:13,123
[SPEAKER_17]: Playgrounds are rated by their grade level.

481
00:45:13,463 --> 00:45:18,308
[SPEAKER_17]: The lower playground is used by our pre-K population that is at the McGlynn.

482
00:45:19,233 --> 00:45:23,115
[SPEAKER_17]: The playground has numerous issues.

483
00:45:23,355 --> 00:45:31,818
[SPEAKER_17]: So before I get into those issues with that report, which is the second request, the design study is moving forward.

484
00:45:32,179 --> 00:45:37,201
[SPEAKER_17]: We have 12 members of a 14-member board identified.

485
00:45:37,961 --> 00:45:47,346
[SPEAKER_17]: we delayed a little bit because we wanted to make sure that the final two spots were truly representative of all Medford.

486
00:45:47,867 --> 00:46:01,895
[SPEAKER_17]: And so we've delayed to be able to make sure that we did some further outreach to make sure that we were really addressing our goals to make sure that this is a universally accessible playground and that we had the appropriate voice there.

487
00:46:02,475 --> 00:46:06,236
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, those 14 people will not represent the only public input.

488
00:46:06,657 --> 00:46:09,578
[SPEAKER_17]: We will have a tremendous amount of public input on this.

489
00:46:09,838 --> 00:46:16,680
[SPEAKER_17]: We will offer multiple opportunities for students to be involved as well so that they can help design the play structures.

490
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:30,285
[SPEAKER_17]: And what is interesting to note is another playground expert that we've had on this project with us has teamed this not just a school playground, but this is a regional destination playground.

491
00:46:31,466 --> 00:46:36,209
[SPEAKER_17]: It services the towers, it services many housing options around there.

492
00:46:36,590 --> 00:46:45,637
[SPEAKER_17]: In the summertime when I drive by, it is frequently filled with students more so than any of the other playgrounds that I see at our schools.

493
00:46:46,437 --> 00:46:49,459
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, so this playground does offer a tremendous amount.

494
00:46:49,499 --> 00:46:59,383
[SPEAKER_17]: We've also met with members of the city administration to identify further funding to carry out this because this is a $150,000 design study, $40,000 of which has been identified

495
00:47:02,705 --> 00:47:17,386
[SPEAKER_17]: through cpc grants but this will get us through drawings and specs so that the city has a full understanding of the commitments moving forward to really have a truly well-designed universally accessible playground

496
00:47:18,387 --> 00:47:18,828
[SPEAKER_17]: in place.

497
00:47:19,428 --> 00:47:22,970
[SPEAKER_17]: And to my knowledge, there's only one other in the area and it just opened.

498
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:25,332
[SPEAKER_17]: It's Dana Hay in Cambridge.

499
00:47:25,992 --> 00:47:31,936
[SPEAKER_17]: So if anybody wants to go and look, it's a great opportunity for you to go and see that.

500
00:47:32,596 --> 00:47:38,840
[SPEAKER_17]: Another one that we were looking at was up in Burlington, Vermont, and then did some other web research across the country.

501
00:47:39,721 --> 00:47:42,122
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's where that is right now.

502
00:47:42,402 --> 00:47:44,204
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll be happy to take questions on that at the end.

503
00:47:45,363 --> 00:47:47,185
[SPEAKER_17]: The second was offered by Jenny Graham.

504
00:47:47,205 --> 00:48:01,361
[SPEAKER_17]: The second motion was offered by Jenny Graham and it was authorizing up to $2,000 for a playground safety inspection by a certified playground safety inspector at the McGlynn elementary playground as quickly as possible.

505
00:48:02,482 --> 00:48:03,443
[SPEAKER_17]: We have completed this.

506
00:48:03,962 --> 00:48:05,562
[SPEAKER_17]: It was not done as quickly as possible.

507
00:48:05,582 --> 00:48:11,584
[SPEAKER_17]: The playground inspector that we contracted with had a variety of unfortunate incidents.

508
00:48:12,804 --> 00:48:18,505
[SPEAKER_17]: And by the time to get someone else in, the person was able to rectify those situations.

509
00:48:19,206 --> 00:48:23,827
[SPEAKER_17]: And we were able to have the playground inspected in early March.

510
00:48:24,567 --> 00:48:25,327
[SPEAKER_17]: That cost was $900.

511
00:48:25,487 --> 00:48:31,969
[SPEAKER_17]: And she is from the, sorry, just trying to read here,

512
00:48:35,984 --> 00:48:39,084
[SPEAKER_17]: Playground Inspections of New England, which is out of Brewster, Massachusetts.

513
00:48:40,410 --> 00:48:42,351
[SPEAKER_17]: So she went through, she took photographs.

514
00:48:42,511 --> 00:48:43,572
[SPEAKER_17]: They're all in your packets.

515
00:48:43,712 --> 00:48:47,795
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll put some of the photographs up on screen for it to be part of the record.

516
00:48:49,356 --> 00:49:09,228
[SPEAKER_17]: One of the things that she noted on the first page was that given the deterioration or the perceived deterioration of the soft surface, which is known as poured in place, that's a 25,000 square foot that two years ago was priced out at over half a million dollars to replace, and which is really what triggered all of this.

517
00:49:10,182 --> 00:49:10,307
[SPEAKER_17]: Um,

518
00:49:11,884 --> 00:49:13,765
[SPEAKER_17]: The playground really should be inspected annually.

519
00:49:14,546 --> 00:49:16,247
[SPEAKER_17]: All playgrounds should be inspected annually.

520
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:18,569
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's going to be an annual cost that we will now incur.

521
00:49:20,170 --> 00:49:22,711
[SPEAKER_17]: She recommended what's known as a head drop test.

522
00:49:23,332 --> 00:49:25,913
[SPEAKER_17]: We were very fortunate to be able to quickly turn that around.

523
00:49:25,974 --> 00:49:27,274
[SPEAKER_17]: The head drop test itself was $2,100.

524
00:49:27,755 --> 00:49:39,523
[SPEAKER_17]: And they did multiple tests from 27 locations around the playground where they used a hemispheric object that had pressure sensors in it.

525
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:41,504
[SPEAKER_17]: So when they dropped it, they would be able to tell

526
00:49:42,004 --> 00:49:45,227
[SPEAKER_17]: the impact ratings and those types of things.

527
00:49:46,228 --> 00:49:49,951
[SPEAKER_17]: At all heights, at all heights tested, the playground passed.

528
00:49:50,571 --> 00:49:50,872
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

529
00:49:51,592 --> 00:50:02,942
[SPEAKER_17]: And I would also like to note in my report that there have been certain times throughout this process that various members of the community have stated that the playground is causing injuries.

530
00:50:04,283 --> 00:50:13,588
[SPEAKER_17]: Conversations with the school nurses and then our director of nursing and health services, Avery Hines, we do not find that to be true.

531
00:50:14,549 --> 00:50:24,875
[SPEAKER_17]: Of all the injuries caused at the McGlynn, only 1.82% are caused as a result of the playground activity, not the playground itself.

532
00:50:26,075 --> 00:50:38,420
[SPEAKER_17]: And so 52 students reported a fall or injury with the play structure and 26 injuries may have been determined to be because a kid ran into one of the support structures itself, running into a pole.

533
00:50:40,161 --> 00:50:48,904
[SPEAKER_17]: Only two of these injuries needed to have a student dismissed and all of these, the nurses feel

534
00:50:49,568 --> 00:51:03,991
[SPEAKER_17]: is 100% attributed to normal childhood development and normal childhood play, which as any of the elementary teachers behind me can attest to, the childhood play is a critical part of a student's learning opportunities.

535
00:51:04,591 --> 00:51:14,414
[SPEAKER_17]: And so this playground becoming a universally accessible playground over the next several years is going to be critical to making sure that that play opportunity is extended to all of our students.

536
00:51:14,434 --> 00:51:15,494
[SPEAKER_17]: So,

537
00:51:16,874 --> 00:51:19,018
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to turn now to the report itself.

538
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:22,665
[SPEAKER_17]: And there were five specific areas that were identified.

539
00:51:23,827 --> 00:51:26,091
[SPEAKER_17]: First, the decks, stairs, and bridges.

540
00:51:27,513 --> 00:51:46,922
[SPEAKER_17]: Then the surfacing itself, that's the poured-in-place surfacing, the drainage, which I've already addressed, the concrete curve structures, which are meant to mimic the path of the Mystic River, and then the edging itself, which is concrete and should probably be bermed down in the interim.

541
00:51:48,142 --> 00:51:52,444
[SPEAKER_17]: So there are various elements of giving priority hazard levels.

542
00:51:54,364 --> 00:52:05,568
[SPEAKER_17]: There were only two areas that were of a high hazard concern that the school is working to mitigate and address those.

543
00:52:05,648 --> 00:52:13,050
[SPEAKER_17]: We will be sealing up a hole in the concrete structure that is higher than it should be that on one day of observing,

544
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:15,690
[SPEAKER_17]: We did see students attempting to climb through.

545
00:52:16,851 --> 00:52:20,911
[SPEAKER_17]: There should be a six foot fall area around all structures.

546
00:52:21,051 --> 00:52:23,992
[SPEAKER_17]: And this one area does not have six feet.

547
00:52:24,072 --> 00:52:24,912
[SPEAKER_17]: It's only three feet.

548
00:52:25,272 --> 00:52:28,013
[SPEAKER_17]: So we will be sealing up that hole for students to play in.

549
00:52:30,673 --> 00:52:32,213
[SPEAKER_17]: And so that'll be done in the near future.

550
00:52:34,434 --> 00:52:39,014
[SPEAKER_17]: So let me just switch to the report.

551
00:52:39,274 --> 00:52:39,815
[SPEAKER_17]: One second.

552
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:41,775
[SPEAKER_14]: So you can see the images.

553
00:52:52,518 --> 00:52:55,962
[SPEAKER_17]: So these were done in early March when snow was still on the ground.

554
00:52:56,102 --> 00:53:01,108
[SPEAKER_17]: You can see over here where the cursor is a large amount of standing water.

555
00:53:02,129 --> 00:53:07,575
[SPEAKER_17]: And then if you scroll down, you can see that the walkway itself is submerged in places.

556
00:53:09,787 --> 00:53:12,649
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, this is also, this was really good information.

557
00:53:12,669 --> 00:53:18,873
[SPEAKER_17]: The teachers noted, you can see here that this playground does not get plowed or cleared of snow.

558
00:53:19,013 --> 00:53:22,255
[SPEAKER_17]: So in our redesign, we will be taking that information in.

559
00:53:22,275 --> 00:53:30,000
[SPEAKER_17]: We also have, just so everyone's aware, of the 12 people selected, there are a number of teachers, OTs and PTs as well, that are going to be asked to be a part of this.

560
00:53:31,722 --> 00:53:39,047
[SPEAKER_17]: And then you have here just this right here where the cursor is shows the deterioration of the port in place.

561
00:53:40,027 --> 00:53:41,869
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, patching of the port in place.

562
00:53:44,611 --> 00:53:47,293
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, more snow deterioration of the port in place.

563
00:53:47,993 --> 00:53:57,361
[SPEAKER_17]: Here you have the decking, our playground inspector Nancy Wright, Nancy White stated that, you know, there's so many ramps, and there's so many bridges.

564
00:53:58,254 --> 00:54:02,255
[SPEAKER_17]: These are by far the most expensive elements in all playgrounds.

565
00:54:02,815 --> 00:54:10,277
[SPEAKER_17]: And not only are they the most expensive in normal times, but she has seen the prices on these elements skyrocket astronomically.

566
00:54:10,397 --> 00:54:20,219
[SPEAKER_17]: So if we were to say, we're just going to replace what's there with new, the cost would be exorbitant for something that, as the playground inspector and others have noticed, just isn't that much fun.

567
00:54:21,412 --> 00:54:22,053
[SPEAKER_17]: for our students.

568
00:54:23,374 --> 00:54:25,957
[SPEAKER_17]: So you've got the bridge here.

569
00:54:26,877 --> 00:54:30,301
[SPEAKER_17]: You've got various elements here as well.

570
00:54:31,382 --> 00:54:32,823
[SPEAKER_17]: This is the area that I was speaking about.

571
00:54:32,883 --> 00:54:35,025
[SPEAKER_17]: The use zone needed is six feet.

572
00:54:35,446 --> 00:54:38,508
[SPEAKER_17]: So the window that's on top of here will be closed off.

573
00:54:42,133 --> 00:54:48,915
[SPEAKER_17]: and then just various underside weeping of various elements for rust and things like that.

574
00:54:49,675 --> 00:54:56,397
[SPEAKER_17]: A slide, there's a spiral slide that can't be used when the flooding is there because it's under several inches of water.

575
00:54:58,677 --> 00:55:02,878
[SPEAKER_17]: And so various elements here that you can see.

576
00:55:03,638 --> 00:55:09,000
[SPEAKER_17]: The head drop inspector actually did a drop from the tree as well so that

577
00:55:10,871 --> 00:55:12,793
[SPEAKER_17]: that we have that information as well.

578
00:55:14,294 --> 00:55:16,316
[SPEAKER_17]: So just various other pieces.

579
00:55:16,336 --> 00:55:19,438
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

580
00:55:20,219 --> 00:55:22,901
[SPEAKER_17]: Just want to address just a couple of quick points, if I may.

581
00:55:25,444 --> 00:55:37,334
[SPEAKER_17]: So in the report itself, the playground inspector was very diplomatic, but basically said that the playground is soon to be at the end of its useful life.

582
00:55:38,250 --> 00:55:46,858
[SPEAKER_17]: The brand name associated with this, I won't use it, but it does last, but it needs to be well maintained.

583
00:55:47,658 --> 00:55:54,484
[SPEAKER_17]: And over the years, you need to maintain it, you need to own it, and there are various moving parts that need to be well cared for.

584
00:55:55,137 --> 00:56:04,543
[SPEAKER_17]: And unfortunately, when cities and municipalities have these types of things, a lot of times the maintenance is what doesn't make it through.

585
00:56:05,023 --> 00:56:13,489
[SPEAKER_17]: The playgrounds are extraordinarily similar, but don't offer a variety of play for our students, as I've mentioned previously.

586
00:56:14,786 --> 00:56:18,449
[SPEAKER_17]: And so those are really the critical aspects of this playground.

587
00:56:19,389 --> 00:56:23,372
[SPEAKER_17]: The inspection where we are, we should be notifying members of the committee later this week.

588
00:56:23,752 --> 00:56:28,956
[SPEAKER_17]: We just have to select the final two after a great deal of outreach has been done.

589
00:56:29,376 --> 00:56:30,577
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you.

590
00:56:30,597 --> 00:56:32,538
[SPEAKER_13]: I apologize for taking- No, I'm just kidding.

591
00:56:33,079 --> 00:56:33,459
[SPEAKER_13]: That's fine.

592
00:56:33,479 --> 00:56:36,141
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Dr. Hsing, and thank you for all the hard work.

593
00:56:36,161 --> 00:56:37,562
[SPEAKER_13]: I know you're putting together a team.

594
00:56:37,602 --> 00:56:42,245
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you in advance to the 14 member board that will help with this project.

595
00:56:43,546 --> 00:56:43,706
[SPEAKER_13]: Great.

596
00:56:44,591 --> 00:56:52,576
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, we have number five, Labor Relations Update, Mr. David Murphy, Assistant Superintendent of Finance and Operations.

597
00:57:03,522 --> 00:57:05,203
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mayor, members of the school committee.

598
00:57:05,223 --> 00:57:10,506
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a pleasure to be with you this evening, with everyone.

599
00:57:11,417 --> 00:57:15,802
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just gonna give Dr. Cushing a moment to put the slides up on the screen.

600
00:57:15,822 --> 00:57:20,026
[SPEAKER_12]: The presentation that you'll see momentarily.

601
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:22,721
[SPEAKER_20]: Member Ruseau?

602
00:57:22,821 --> 00:57:25,623
[SPEAKER_20]: If the audience can't be heard, I'm not sure we can continue this.

603
00:57:26,584 --> 00:57:27,165
[SPEAKER_13]: No, it's fine.

604
00:57:28,626 --> 00:57:29,467
[SPEAKER_13]: Signs are fine.

605
00:57:29,567 --> 00:57:33,370
[SPEAKER_13]: If you could just let Mr. Murphy, so that we can hear him, that would be great.

606
00:57:33,430 --> 00:57:37,974
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I know we have the union rep who's next on the agenda, so we can all be civil.

607
00:57:38,014 --> 00:57:39,435
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sure that will be the case.

608
00:57:39,515 --> 00:57:40,757
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Member Ruseau.

609
00:57:41,037 --> 00:57:41,497
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Murphy?

610
00:57:41,838 --> 00:57:42,178
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mayor.

611
00:57:43,284 --> 00:57:54,347
[SPEAKER_12]: So tonight's update, as you know, we're updating you on a regular basis at this point in the fiscal year on our upcoming FY23 operating budget.

612
00:57:55,327 --> 00:58:03,609
[SPEAKER_12]: Tonight's update relates to a significant component of that operating budget and frankly, every school department's operating budget.

613
00:58:04,629 --> 00:58:10,130
[SPEAKER_12]: And that is the state of our labor relations and specifically our collective bargaining negotiations.

614
00:58:10,630 --> 00:58:16,056
[SPEAKER_12]: which as the committee knows, we are engaged in and have been over the course of this school year.

615
00:58:16,116 --> 00:58:21,181
[SPEAKER_12]: So Dr. Cushing, we don't need to do the zooming in until the upcoming slides.

616
00:58:21,201 --> 00:58:22,943
[SPEAKER_12]: So if we go to the next one, just with respect to the

617
00:58:23,533 --> 00:58:37,416
[SPEAKER_12]: the bargaining partners themselves, and that's for the community's benefit, the school district has 10 collective bargaining partners, 10 bargaining units, unions that we work with on a regular basis that represents the vast majority of our employees.

618
00:58:37,536 --> 00:58:51,760
[SPEAKER_12]: And obviously, at this point in the negotiations, as evident by our guests this evening, it's normal that in the course of collective bargaining negotiations, that there are gonna be points of disagreement.

619
00:58:52,486 --> 00:59:00,131
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I did want to start by saying, and for those that think it's just rhetoric and would like to dismiss it, that's certainly their right.

620
00:59:00,191 --> 00:59:16,381
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think I have a responsibility on behalf of the administration and of the school committee to make very clear that the 10 bargaining units in front of you represent hundreds of extremely hardworking, dedicated public servants that the Medfordist community

621
00:59:16,901 --> 00:59:31,378
[SPEAKER_12]: benefits from on a daily basis and that's been certainly true in a pronounced way over the course of the past two years, as the individuals represented by the union leadership that's here with us this evening.

622
00:59:32,038 --> 00:59:39,484
[SPEAKER_12]: has in many ways carried this community, and most importantly, the children and young adults of this community on their back.

623
00:59:39,624 --> 00:59:52,615
[SPEAKER_12]: And so regardless of what other finer details we may disagree with from time to time, I think it's important that we start from that premise, that they are the ones that do the work.

624
00:59:53,055 --> 00:59:56,518
[SPEAKER_12]: We are the ones that are on local cable on a regular basis talking about the work.

625
00:59:57,358 --> 00:59:58,518
[SPEAKER_12]: That is our responsibility.

626
00:59:58,538 --> 01:00:00,079
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's an important responsibility.

627
01:00:00,119 --> 01:00:07,980
[SPEAKER_12]: It's important that the community understand the district's vision priorities and how that is translating into the expenditure of their taxpayer dollars.

628
01:00:08,740 --> 01:00:22,883
[SPEAKER_12]: But there's no question that the people who are actually doing the work, serving children and putting those children in a better position to live lives that are meaningful and fulfilling are the people that are with us this evening and the people that they represent.

629
01:00:24,611 --> 01:00:26,473
[SPEAKER_12]: So these are the 10.

630
01:00:26,613 --> 01:00:29,696
[SPEAKER_12]: As you can see, I've given the status of each of the negotiations of the 10.

631
01:00:30,537 --> 01:00:31,818
[SPEAKER_12]: There is one collective bargaining agreement.

632
01:00:32,178 --> 01:00:35,421
[SPEAKER_12]: Our cafeteria workers, that contract is not yet open.

633
01:00:35,461 --> 01:00:39,445
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we have not yet begun that process with that unit.

634
01:00:40,065 --> 01:00:43,148
[SPEAKER_12]: With the others, the majority, we are in ongoing negotiations.

635
01:00:43,488 --> 01:00:49,274
[SPEAKER_12]: There's one bargaining that we've scheduled a first session with, but have not gotten to the table.

636
01:00:49,874 --> 01:01:03,220
[SPEAKER_12]: And then a couple of others that for various reasons, the negotiations are yet to commence but we're certainly in contact with and in regular communication with representatives from those units and looking forward to sitting down with them in the near future.

637
01:01:05,966 --> 01:01:16,133
[SPEAKER_12]: Sometimes this is specifically codified in a ground rule and other times it's not, but the district's position is that the specifics of proposals that are exchanged at the table should remain confidential.

638
01:01:16,894 --> 01:01:23,058
[SPEAKER_12]: Oftentimes when you see a specific proposal in a vacuum taken out of context, it can be quite misleading.

639
01:01:23,118 --> 01:01:35,386
[SPEAKER_12]: And so not wanting to try to put an emphasis on transparency in this case means that we're not as an administration going to get into the specific proposals that we have made or that we've received from our bargaining partners.

640
01:01:36,367 --> 01:01:44,372
[SPEAKER_12]: That being said, there are some overarching objectives that transcend each of our negotiations, and those are listed here.

641
01:01:45,193 --> 01:01:52,498
[SPEAKER_12]: Now I should have told you to zoom in on it, Dr. Cushman, so I could see it, but certainly the quality of instruction, thank you, I appreciate that.

642
01:01:53,038 --> 01:02:01,845
[SPEAKER_12]: The quality of the instructional time for students is something that, as the committee knows, it's a strategic priority, it's embedded within our strategic plan, and it helps inform many of our bargaining priorities.

643
01:02:02,461 --> 01:02:14,649
[SPEAKER_12]: efficiency of time and the use of time to make sure that that is yielding as positive an impact for students is another significant piece, increase in wages to maintain competitiveness while sustainability.

644
01:02:15,069 --> 01:02:17,471
[SPEAKER_12]: Obviously, there are two parts to that to that bullet point.

645
01:02:17,791 --> 01:02:23,555
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's a part that depending on where we are in the course of the bargaining cycle, the parties may want to emphasize more.

646
01:02:24,699 --> 01:02:29,863
[SPEAKER_12]: As you can imagine, it's not uncommon for the bargaining units to want to emphasize the competitiveness component.

647
01:02:30,203 --> 01:02:34,346
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not uncommon for the district to want to emphasize the sustainability component.

648
01:02:34,947 --> 01:02:40,171
[SPEAKER_12]: The part that I wanted to emphasize here before we move on to the next slide is that both things are true.

649
01:02:40,911 --> 01:02:53,241
[SPEAKER_12]: When we enter into collective bargaining negotiations, if we are going to recruit and retain the best talent to serve the children of Medford, we have to be thinking along the lines of making sure that those wage increases are competitive.

650
01:02:53,261 --> 01:02:54,442
[SPEAKER_12]: There's no disputing that.

651
01:02:54,482 --> 01:02:55,843
[SPEAKER_12]: You can see the final bullet point there.

652
01:02:56,244 --> 01:03:02,849
[SPEAKER_12]: As an administration, we try to identify the shared interests, the things that we know both will serve the interests of the organization

653
01:03:03,310 --> 01:03:08,118
[SPEAKER_12]: And we'll serve the interests of the employees because there's a mutual interest in wanting people to work here.

654
01:03:08,479 --> 01:03:10,703
[SPEAKER_12]: We want to be a place that people want to come and teach.

655
01:03:11,104 --> 01:03:13,749
[SPEAKER_12]: And so that's why the competitiveness is important.

656
01:03:14,069 --> 01:03:14,891
[SPEAKER_12]: And at the same time.

657
01:03:15,822 --> 01:03:27,764
[SPEAKER_12]: It is incumbent upon us in district leadership to make sure that we are preserving the necessary flexibility to respond to needs in the future and to make sure that we're not creating structural deficits.

658
01:03:28,184 --> 01:03:33,846
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's why that sustainability is something that for us always has to be paired with the competitiveness.

659
01:03:33,946 --> 01:03:40,687
[SPEAKER_12]: And I would say, frankly, I'm not going to speak on behalf of the unions this evening, but generally speaking, we've had good constructive dialogue

660
01:03:41,287 --> 01:03:42,308
[SPEAKER_12]: with our bargaining partners.

661
01:03:42,628 --> 01:03:48,433
[SPEAKER_12]: And no one is advocating necessarily for blowing holes in the budget.

662
01:03:48,874 --> 01:04:01,484
[SPEAKER_12]: But as the administration ultimately being responsible for the integrity of the budget and making sure that it's there to respond to our needs in the future, that is something that we have to prioritize and we have to continue to do going forward.

663
01:04:01,905 --> 01:04:03,646
[SPEAKER_12]: Dr. Christian, you can move to the next one now.

664
01:04:03,666 --> 01:04:06,209
[SPEAKER_12]: And then as we get to this next slide,

665
01:04:07,338 --> 01:04:11,419
[SPEAKER_12]: you will see that there are four tables.

666
01:04:11,619 --> 01:04:13,760
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm going to move left to right.

667
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:18,882
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is probably confirming the statements earlier that the most fun part of the evening is over.

668
01:04:18,902 --> 01:04:19,982
[SPEAKER_12]: I recognize that.

669
01:04:20,002 --> 01:04:21,723
[SPEAKER_12]: I appreciate your indulgence.

670
01:04:21,763 --> 01:04:29,165
[SPEAKER_12]: But as we move left to right, this slide attempts to show the connection between what we're doing at the bargaining table

671
01:04:29,725 --> 01:04:35,446
[SPEAKER_12]: and what we need to do with regard to having a sound fiscal stewardship of the district in fiscal year 23.

672
01:04:35,827 --> 01:04:47,830
[SPEAKER_12]: So these, and by the way, these are numbers that in various presentations you've all seen before, they're tied here together in tonight's presentation to emphasize how this is connected to our collective bargaining strategies.

673
01:04:48,310 --> 01:04:51,671
[SPEAKER_12]: So you'll see that in FY21, the district's operating budget was $62.3 million.

674
01:04:53,931 --> 01:05:01,373
[SPEAKER_12]: In FY22, that's our current fiscal year, our operating budget rose 8.2% to $67.4 million.

675
01:05:01,473 --> 01:05:10,615
[SPEAKER_12]: All of you sat through in one capacity or another, I imagine, our budget process last spring, and we've updated you on a quarterly basis since then.

676
01:05:11,195 --> 01:05:14,336
[SPEAKER_12]: And as you know, that increase in costs

677
01:05:15,049 --> 01:05:22,617
[SPEAKER_12]: There was a direct correlation between the supports and services that we're providing to students, particularly in the hopefully in the wake of the pandemic.

678
01:05:23,178 --> 01:05:29,925
[SPEAKER_12]: And that is largely where you saw that increase, you also know, and you can see, in the second row here that, as we presented in the budget last year.

679
01:05:30,705 --> 01:05:38,671
[SPEAKER_12]: and as we've done so throughout this fiscal year, that there is a budgeted amount of 2% with regard to a cost of living increase.

680
01:05:39,551 --> 01:05:52,380
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not speaking specifically to what we may or may not have proposed related to wage increases, but as we've said throughout the year and our obligations, we are a public entity, so there aren't any hidden lines in the budget.

681
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:58,684
[SPEAKER_12]: What we've presented consistently is that the budgeted cost of living increase is 2%.

682
01:06:00,865 --> 01:06:13,814
[SPEAKER_12]: If you look to the bottom row here in this first table, you'll see that for FY22 and FY23, these are our fixed cost increases.

683
01:06:14,355 --> 01:06:28,945
[SPEAKER_12]: Our fixed cost increases, which you as a committee hear about each time we have one of these budget updates and leading up to a fiscal year, are the increases in next year's fiscal budget that decisions for which have already been made.

684
01:06:29,545 --> 01:06:33,347
[SPEAKER_12]: So the most commonly discussed would be your steps and lanes.

685
01:06:33,608 --> 01:06:40,792
[SPEAKER_12]: Those are contractual increases that are owed to our employees that are due in FY23, regardless of what we negotiate.

686
01:06:40,852 --> 01:06:43,334
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, the steps and lanes are not $2.4 to $2.6 million.

687
01:06:43,354 --> 01:06:47,456
[SPEAKER_12]: They're about $800,000 or so, if there's a different number on it, $1.1 million, excuse me.

688
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:57,202
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's a large percentage, but it's not the entirety of the fixed cost increases.

689
01:06:57,603 --> 01:07:02,025
[SPEAKER_12]: If you move now, Dr. Cushing, over to that table in the middle, if you could, on this same slide.

690
01:07:03,166 --> 01:07:04,927
[SPEAKER_10]: Can I just have a point of information, Mayor?

691
01:07:04,947 --> 01:07:08,989
[SPEAKER_10]: Point of information, just if you could share what steps and lanes are for folks who are watching who don't know.

692
01:07:09,089 --> 01:07:09,590
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Ms.

693
01:07:09,610 --> 01:07:10,030
[SPEAKER_12]: McLaughlin.

694
01:07:10,050 --> 01:07:11,571
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a good question.

695
01:07:11,931 --> 01:07:13,652
[SPEAKER_12]: So in our collective bargaining agreement,

696
01:07:14,342 --> 01:07:18,606
[SPEAKER_12]: There are wage tables and this is essentially true for all collective bargaining agreements.

697
01:07:18,746 --> 01:07:24,291
[SPEAKER_12]: There are a few exceptions and the specifics of the wage table varies from unit to unit.

698
01:07:24,951 --> 01:07:34,860
[SPEAKER_12]: However, as an employer of approximately 100 people, approximately 500 being in the teacher's unit, that wage table is the biggest driver of the budget as it is in any school district.

699
01:07:35,521 --> 01:07:43,675
[SPEAKER_12]: And typically other wage tables, while possibly somewhat more simplified than the teachers, follow along a somewhat similar pattern.

700
01:07:45,410 --> 01:07:57,521
[SPEAKER_12]: The easiest way to think about it is that you have step increases that are typically represented by rows that mean increases year over year individual salaries based on experience.

701
01:07:57,681 --> 01:08:08,390
[SPEAKER_12]: As an educator accumulates experience, the contract contemplates essentially an increase in the monetary value associated with that employee and the step increase is representative of that.

702
01:08:08,790 --> 01:08:12,252
[SPEAKER_12]: the lane increases, which are a much more modest budgetary impact.

703
01:08:12,312 --> 01:08:29,263
[SPEAKER_12]: And so for this conversation, I think, frankly, not worth a lot of time, but those are essentially professional development and credits that the educator accumulates, ideally with a nexus between what they're studying and what, you know,

704
01:08:29,795 --> 01:08:36,977
[SPEAKER_12]: the work that they're doing, and in recognition of that added value, there are compensation increases that are implemented throughout the fiscal year.

705
01:08:37,457 --> 01:08:46,399
[SPEAKER_12]: But again, the lanes, we always sort of, in contract world, talk about them in conjunction with one another, but the steps are a significantly greater budgetary impact than the lanes.

706
01:08:46,759 --> 01:08:48,980
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for asking that question.

707
01:08:49,880 --> 01:09:05,932
[SPEAKER_12]: So as we move to the middle table there, you can see that, and as we presented in the previous FY23 budget updates, the steps and lanes and other contractual increases are not the only fixed cost increases that we're seeing.

708
01:09:06,633 --> 01:09:12,817
[SPEAKER_12]: Some are related to energy and utilities, and those are ones, obviously, that we monitor and we try to identify efficiencies as best we can.

709
01:09:12,878 --> 01:09:15,840
[SPEAKER_12]: But when we know we're a quarter million dollars over in

710
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:18,062
[SPEAKER_12]: utilities bill in a previous fiscal year.

711
01:09:18,102 --> 01:09:21,184
[SPEAKER_12]: That's something that we have to plan for in the succeeding fiscal year.

712
01:09:21,805 --> 01:09:29,271
[SPEAKER_12]: We are, as I mentioned in the previous meeting, in this previous update, in the third year of a three-year contract with our primary bus vendor, Eastern Bus.

713
01:09:29,932 --> 01:09:34,315
[SPEAKER_12]: And so that contract, which is in its final year, is seeing a $50,000 fixed cost increase.

714
01:09:35,136 --> 01:09:41,802
[SPEAKER_12]: And then with regard to the other major driver, and this is a change from the last fixed cost increase update, if you remember last fiscal year,

715
01:09:42,242 --> 01:09:49,084
[SPEAKER_12]: We started with a fixed cost increase at one number, and it went up over the course of the budget process.

716
01:09:49,124 --> 01:09:53,025
[SPEAKER_12]: That's because as new information becomes available to us, we have a responsibility to update those numbers.

717
01:09:53,425 --> 01:09:58,067
[SPEAKER_12]: We now have greater clarity with regard to our special education fixed cost increases.

718
01:09:58,507 --> 01:10:02,188
[SPEAKER_12]: That's our out-of-district tuitions and specialized transportation for the most part.

719
01:10:02,528 --> 01:10:03,588
[SPEAKER_12]: Right now, we're projecting that at $750,000.

720
01:10:05,929 --> 01:10:12,271
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think the question, and then if you go to the third table, there are, as there always are at this point in the fiscal year.

721
01:10:13,931 --> 01:10:15,092
[SPEAKER_13]: What information, member Rousseau?

722
01:10:15,552 --> 01:10:16,912
[SPEAKER_20]: Those are just the increases.

723
01:10:16,972 --> 01:10:24,434
[SPEAKER_20]: So when it says $200,000 for gas, it is not that we're spending $200,000 on gas, we're spending $200,000 more than we did this year.

724
01:10:24,854 --> 01:10:29,116
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. Rousseau, and I probably did breeze over that point too quickly.

725
01:10:29,136 --> 01:10:31,856
[SPEAKER_12]: Our utilities bill is significantly higher than $200,000.

726
01:10:31,896 --> 01:10:32,137
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

727
01:10:34,286 --> 01:10:37,708
[SPEAKER_12]: So even when we turn the lights off every night, we can't get it below that.

728
01:10:37,828 --> 01:10:40,829
[SPEAKER_12]: So that third table there, there are some question marks.

729
01:10:40,889 --> 01:10:52,074
[SPEAKER_12]: And you'll recall in the previous budget update, there's a strategic decision that has to be made with regard to the staffing support to be associated with the new math curriculum that the district has adopted.

730
01:10:53,354 --> 01:11:06,379
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not a decision that's been made yet, but if we have no staffing support associated with that, which is not going to be the recommendation of the administration, we are still at a $200,000 fixed-cost increase.

731
01:11:06,819 --> 01:11:12,541
[SPEAKER_12]: So in the bottom table there on the right, and I thank Dr. Cushing for the sound navigation of this,

732
01:11:15,973 --> 01:11:19,694
[SPEAKER_12]: fixed cost increases somewhere between 2.4 and $2.6 million.

733
01:11:20,415 --> 01:11:28,038
[SPEAKER_12]: That means that if the district were to not enter into any new successor agreements, which is not our goal, it is not our preference.

734
01:11:28,178 --> 01:11:32,319
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm confident it is not the preference of the vast majority of our employees.

735
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:38,502
[SPEAKER_12]: But if there were no successor agreements, we would already be at approximately $2.5 million.

736
01:11:38,782 --> 01:11:42,683
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not gonna use the term whole or deficit because I think there are too many other variables.

737
01:11:42,723 --> 01:11:43,424
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think frankly,

738
01:11:44,744 --> 01:11:51,189
[SPEAKER_12]: term that finance administrators throw around on a too liberal a basis in these types of discussions each year.

739
01:11:52,290 --> 01:11:57,233
[SPEAKER_12]: But there's $2.5 million in added costs that we have to prepare for.

740
01:11:57,593 --> 01:12:00,535
[SPEAKER_12]: And when we reference back the FY21 to FY22 budgetary increase of

741
01:12:06,358 --> 01:12:19,027
[SPEAKER_12]: 8%, assuming as I think we have a responsibility to do that, that can't increase at that number every single year, that $2.5 million does represent a significant challenge to the district.

742
01:12:19,407 --> 01:12:32,857
[SPEAKER_12]: It does not eliminate the priority that I referenced at the beginning of this discussion, which is that in order for us to recruit and retain talent, we have to both have wage increases that are competitive and sustainable.

743
01:12:33,317 --> 01:13:00,042
[SPEAKER_12]: And the sustainable part, frankly, is just as relevant to the recruitment and retention objective, because if we do create those structural deficits, and if there is that type of instability in the system that leads to significant layoffs, that leads to an inability to staff positions appropriately, that leads to the district's inability to set to staff positions that support high-need students, it becomes that much more challenging to do this work and do this work effectively.

744
01:13:00,502 --> 01:13:13,530
[SPEAKER_12]: And so while our commitment to competitive and sustainable wage increases is authentic, and it is legitimate, and it is a necessity for us to run this organization in a sound way, it is not a priority that can be looked at in a vacuum.

745
01:13:13,971 --> 01:13:15,632
[SPEAKER_12]: It has to be looked at in this context.

746
01:13:15,692 --> 01:13:21,816
[SPEAKER_12]: If we could go to the next slide, and there's just a few other points, and then I'd be more than happy to take the committee's questions.

747
01:13:24,298 --> 01:13:27,439
[SPEAKER_12]: The projected budgetary impact of the increases is $1 million.

748
01:13:28,519 --> 01:13:35,241
[SPEAKER_12]: You can see, as I reported last time, Massachusetts is seeing a significant increase in Chapter 70 funding.

749
01:13:35,301 --> 01:13:36,701
[SPEAKER_12]: That is true across the board.

750
01:13:37,021 --> 01:13:38,041
[SPEAKER_12]: That is true in Medford.

751
01:13:38,341 --> 01:13:47,523
[SPEAKER_12]: We typically average approximately $140,000 increase in Chapter 70 funding, and our Chapter 70 funding increase this year is $1.6 million.

752
01:13:47,904 --> 01:13:49,484
[SPEAKER_12]: That's significant, and it's important.

753
01:13:50,185 --> 01:13:56,912
[SPEAKER_12]: However, it's also as I will reference momentarily, a double edged sword, because, and this is the short version of it.

754
01:13:57,413 --> 01:14:04,501
[SPEAKER_12]: The chapter 70 number only represents 20% of the Medford public schools operating budget we are largely a local contribution district.

755
01:14:04,861 --> 01:14:13,546
[SPEAKER_12]: And so even with that number going up, and there's a somewhat corresponding number going up with respect to our local contribution, it represents only a fraction of our budget.

756
01:14:13,926 --> 01:14:27,014
[SPEAKER_12]: And then to sort of put a final bow on that point as to why it's not necessarily something that we can pop champagne bottles over, Medford is already over by a significant margin.

757
01:14:27,654 --> 01:14:30,496
[SPEAKER_12]: the net school spending number that the state requires.

758
01:14:30,936 --> 01:14:44,643
[SPEAKER_12]: And so that $1.6 million, while the district will absolutely advocate for it, you will hear it in the budget presentations, I would expect the school committee to advocate to the municipal government on our behalf to make sure that that number is represented in the increase we see in FY23.

759
01:14:45,144 --> 01:14:55,129
[SPEAKER_12]: Because it's such a small percentage and because we are already over the net school spending number, it does not represent a significant material impact on where we are from FY22 to FY23.

760
01:14:56,732 --> 01:14:57,773
[SPEAKER_09]: Point of information there.

761
01:14:59,134 --> 01:15:02,477
[SPEAKER_09]: Point of information, Member McLaughlin, just a brief explanation of Chapter 70.

762
01:15:02,778 --> 01:15:03,238
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely, Ms.

763
01:15:03,258 --> 01:15:11,846
[SPEAKER_12]: McLaughlin, and thank you again for keeping an eye on my moving through things too quickly.

764
01:15:12,046 --> 01:15:13,167
[SPEAKER_12]: I think I have.

765
01:15:14,088 --> 01:15:19,853
[SPEAKER_12]: So in Massachusetts, under Education Reform Act of 1993, there's something called net school spending.

766
01:15:20,234 --> 01:15:22,536
[SPEAKER_12]: So every municipality in Massachusetts

767
01:15:22,956 --> 01:15:27,558
[SPEAKER_12]: has two numbers that are issued at every budget season.

768
01:15:27,978 --> 01:15:34,261
[SPEAKER_12]: There's the Chapter 70 number, which is essentially the amount of money that we are going to receive from Beacon Hill.

769
01:15:34,601 --> 01:15:45,406
[SPEAKER_12]: It's money that comes from taxpayers across the Commonwealth, and the rationale behind the Chapter 70 number is that the residents of Malden, the residents of Arlington, the residents of Attleboro, the residents of Boston,

770
01:15:45,839 --> 01:15:52,102
[SPEAKER_12]: have an obligation to support the Medford public schools in educating our students.

771
01:15:52,302 --> 01:15:59,405
[SPEAKER_12]: And your taxpayer dollars also go and support Chapter 70 funding to states across the Commonwealth.

772
01:15:59,566 --> 01:16:07,909
[SPEAKER_12]: The local contribution number is the minimum number amount of money that the municipal government in each city and town must allocate to its school system.

773
01:16:07,929 --> 01:16:11,451
[SPEAKER_12]: And those numbers together is the foundation budget and the net school spending number.

774
01:16:11,851 --> 01:16:15,193
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's a host of other complexities to it with regard to offsets and what

775
01:16:15,753 --> 01:16:21,558
[SPEAKER_12]: a city or town can take credit for that I don't think are necessarily relevant for this conversation.

776
01:16:21,598 --> 01:16:29,625
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think understanding that our budget is made up of a chapter 70 number coming from the state and a local contribution number coming from the municipal government is important.

777
01:16:30,106 --> 01:16:38,413
[SPEAKER_12]: The breakdown as to what percentage is in each is designed, at least according to the drafters, and I'm not going to editorialize on

778
01:16:39,441 --> 01:16:47,263
[SPEAKER_12]: the specifics of it tonight, to be representative of the socioeconomic dynamics of the community and of the needs of the students of that community.

779
01:16:47,704 --> 01:16:58,407
[SPEAKER_12]: And so it is supposed to establish a floor, not a ceiling, but a floor as to that community's investment and the Commonwealth's investment in education in that community.

780
01:17:04,517 --> 01:17:05,538
[SPEAKER_12]: I think I answered that one, correct?

781
01:17:05,838 --> 01:17:06,118
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.

782
01:17:06,238 --> 01:17:07,839
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, if we'll go to the next slide.

783
01:17:07,879 --> 01:17:17,105
[SPEAKER_12]: And so, again, I'll be as efficient as I can and ask that those members of the committee hold me accountable for anything that we skip over.

784
01:17:17,145 --> 01:17:25,170
[SPEAKER_12]: But the five boxes here, I don't know that we need to zoom in on all of them other than the sort of bottom left-hand corner.

785
01:17:27,011 --> 01:17:31,473
[SPEAKER_12]: Those represent the priorities that have been identified through the budget process to date.

786
01:17:31,653 --> 01:17:48,981
[SPEAKER_12]: So these are your supports for high-need learners, the staffing positions that we see as critical priorities, the professional learning that we want to make sure that our educators and staff can benefit from, and the equity supports that we believe can help close the opportunity gaps that some of our high-need and most vulnerable populations face.

787
01:17:50,003 --> 01:17:50,644
[SPEAKER_12]: are experiencing.

788
01:17:51,144 --> 01:17:54,148
[SPEAKER_12]: In the bottom left here, you see the numbers that I've shared with you tonight.

789
01:17:54,589 --> 01:18:03,199
[SPEAKER_12]: It's approximately a $2.5 million with regard to fixed costs, $1.6 million increase with regard to Chapter 70.

790
01:18:03,580 --> 01:18:07,124
[SPEAKER_12]: And so that becomes the question is, is that the deficit that has to be filled?

791
01:18:07,584 --> 01:18:11,226
[SPEAKER_12]: And the answer, I said not exactly here, but the answer is essentially no for a couple of reasons.

792
01:18:11,366 --> 01:18:16,308
[SPEAKER_12]: One, as I said, I think using those types of terms can be misleading, so I'm going to try to avoid it.

793
01:18:17,188 --> 01:18:26,753
[SPEAKER_12]: But also because that $2.5 million fixed cost increase does not represent any cost of living increase beyond what has already been budgeted for.

794
01:18:27,333 --> 01:18:35,597
[SPEAKER_12]: And so if we are going to be committed to competitive and sustainable wage increases, and if we have nine collective bargaining agreements, one could presume

795
01:18:36,533 --> 01:18:38,954
[SPEAKER_12]: that that number will end up being higher than it is.

796
01:18:39,754 --> 01:18:59,762
[SPEAKER_12]: And because we've already spoken about how it can be misleading to put all of our eggs in the $1.6 million Chapter 70 basket, you can see that that deficit, again, it's a deficit in this moment, because those are where the numbers are, is more significant than the numbers that are represented here.

797
01:18:59,782 --> 01:19:05,605
[SPEAKER_12]: If we go to the next slide, there's just a few final points, and then I will fulfill my commitment

798
01:19:06,977 --> 01:19:09,639
[SPEAKER_12]: allow you to move on with your evening.

799
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:11,881
[SPEAKER_12]: And most of these have been covered.

800
01:19:12,601 --> 01:19:19,006
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, you've heard me speak to our commitment with regard to the wage increases, the local contribution implications.

801
01:19:20,126 --> 01:19:25,470
[SPEAKER_12]: The other bullet point as to like, how is it that we're gonna do those priorities that are listed there in those five boxes?

802
01:19:25,910 --> 01:19:28,252
[SPEAKER_12]: We do have external funding available to us.

803
01:19:28,813 --> 01:19:34,857
[SPEAKER_12]: And as we reported earlier, we're expecting to have spent approximately $1.4 million in our ESSER funding and FY

804
01:19:36,078 --> 01:19:44,570
[SPEAKER_12]: 22.

805
01:19:36,198 --> 01:19:44,570
[SPEAKER_12]: That is lower than what we had initially projected, although there's been a significant amount of very good usage of that funding.

806
01:19:44,910 --> 01:19:52,360
[SPEAKER_12]: That is the funding that we've used to host acceleration programs, particularly in math at the elementary level.

807
01:19:52,740 --> 01:20:13,141
[SPEAKER_12]: There's been camp Mustang programs focused on SEL both during the summer and school vacations, and they've been a variety of other programs and initiatives including the formation of an engagement team expansion of free transportation for high school students, all of that has gone into has come from the s or bucket, and as a general rule, and this excuse me it's not really general it's more like federal federal regulation.

808
01:20:13,921 --> 01:20:22,390
[SPEAKER_12]: the propriety of the ESSER expenditures are based on the nexus between what it is that we're expending it on and the impact of the pandemic.

809
01:20:22,430 --> 01:20:28,597
[SPEAKER_12]: So it is not a bucket of money to just use for any purpose, nor is it reoccurring funding.

810
01:20:28,917 --> 01:20:32,758
[SPEAKER_12]: And for purposes of this conversation, that's really the most relevant point with regard to the ESSER.

811
01:20:33,118 --> 01:20:34,879
[SPEAKER_12]: ESSER is a temporary grant.

812
01:20:35,339 --> 01:20:51,404
[SPEAKER_12]: It is a significant amount of money that the district has a responsibility to make sure that we're using wisely and on behalf of students, but it is a money with an expiration date, both in the sense that we have to spend it and that there's no indication at this point, at least, that it would be renewed at any point in the future.

813
01:20:53,735 --> 01:21:18,415
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I think the last bullet point just speaks to, and this is not specific to FY23, our responsibility as a district is always to be looking for efficiencies, to be identifying savings when possible, and making sure that where we can repurpose funding in a way that better serves students, it's our obligation to be continuously looking for those opportunities.

814
01:21:19,810 --> 01:21:28,117
[SPEAKER_12]: So just with regard to the plans moving forward, we will continue to negotiate in good faith with each of our collective bargaining partners.

815
01:21:28,898 --> 01:21:36,845
[SPEAKER_12]: We are grateful both to the educators and staff who have been exceedingly patient over the course of this year.

816
01:21:37,625 --> 01:21:44,371
[SPEAKER_12]: I understand that there's frustration that's being expressed in a variety of forms and that's perfectly understandable and we respect that.

817
01:21:46,290 --> 01:21:53,955
[SPEAKER_12]: I've detailed tonight our responsibilities and we're gonna continue to do our best to fulfill those and do it in a professional and constructive manner.

818
01:21:54,395 --> 01:21:56,116
[SPEAKER_12]: And with that, I'm more than happy to take your questions.

819
01:21:56,996 --> 01:21:57,517
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Duff.

820
01:21:57,717 --> 01:21:59,218
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy, Attorney Murphy.

821
01:21:59,238 --> 01:22:01,339
[SPEAKER_13]: Are there any questions from the committee?

822
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:03,460
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Graham.

823
01:22:05,321 --> 01:22:07,182
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanna make sure I'm clear.

824
01:22:07,763 --> 01:22:14,106
[SPEAKER_05]: So the 2% COLA that you referenced that was in the FY22 budget,

825
01:22:16,235 --> 01:22:17,937
[SPEAKER_05]: equates to how much money?

826
01:22:17,957 --> 01:22:18,977
[SPEAKER_12]: $1 million.

827
01:22:19,178 --> 01:22:23,361
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is across all bargaining units, or is that just the teachers contract?

828
01:22:23,701 --> 01:22:36,873
[SPEAKER_12]: It is across all bargaining units with the exception of the non-unit employees, but the non-unit employees represent such a small fraction of the organization that it would be more than a rounding error, but it would be approximately $75,000 or so, maybe $85,000.

829
01:22:36,973 --> 01:22:38,174
[SPEAKER_12]: But the 1 million represents all 10 bargaining units.

830
01:22:43,413 --> 01:22:47,514
[SPEAKER_12]: So I should just say, as I do each, all of these are, are approximations.

831
01:22:47,994 --> 01:22:50,615
[SPEAKER_12]: They're none of them are to the penny, all of them though.

832
01:22:50,635 --> 01:23:00,117
[SPEAKER_12]: If, if I, if there's a, you know, the, the $1.1 million I believe might be a 1,900,000 or 50 or something along those lines.

833
01:23:00,137 --> 01:23:01,638
[SPEAKER_12]: So, okay.

834
01:23:01,938 --> 01:23:06,619
[SPEAKER_05]: So 2% equals a million dollars and that is for all units.

835
01:23:06,819 --> 01:23:07,279
[SPEAKER_05]: That's correct.

836
01:23:07,299 --> 01:23:07,799
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

837
01:23:08,079 --> 01:23:08,379
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

838
01:23:08,439 --> 01:23:09,180
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's for FY 22.

839
01:23:09,220 --> 01:23:09,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.

840
01:23:10,990 --> 01:23:15,273
[SPEAKER_05]: So for FY23, 2% would equal more than $1 million.

841
01:23:15,493 --> 01:23:18,055
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that's an important, I appreciate that, Ms.

842
01:23:18,075 --> 01:23:18,335
[SPEAKER_12]: Graham.

843
01:23:19,556 --> 01:23:22,818
[SPEAKER_12]: All wage increases that go into a wage scale have a compounding impact.

844
01:23:22,878 --> 01:23:29,422
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I don't have that number in front of me right now, but I would imagine it's about 1.1, 1.2, somewhere in that range, maybe a little bit less.

845
01:23:31,621 --> 01:23:34,582
[SPEAKER_12]: And obviously the number of employees has an impact on that as well.

846
01:23:35,122 --> 01:23:50,266
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that if you look at the priorities that we've identified throughout the budget process, one of the terms you've heard me say, I'm gonna avoid talking about deficits that only exist on paper, at least for this evening.

847
01:23:50,967 --> 01:23:58,969
[SPEAKER_12]: But one of the points that you've heard me say many times in your budget updates is that the budget for a school system is almost all people.

848
01:23:59,494 --> 01:23:59,654
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

849
01:24:00,035 --> 01:24:05,080
[SPEAKER_12]: So of our $67 million $55 million are in personnel costs and salaries.

850
01:24:06,442 --> 01:24:10,867
[SPEAKER_12]: That is not just that's not specific to the Medford public schools that's all public school systems.

851
01:24:11,488 --> 01:24:20,398
[SPEAKER_12]: And I imagine the teachers who are short on supplies and are always looking for copy paper and they all the other things, so many things that are broken, they can attest to the fact that that's not typically where the money goes.

852
01:24:21,156 --> 01:24:29,378
[SPEAKER_12]: And it shouldn't because it's the people that are going to make the difference in terms of having an impact on our students and particularly true for our most vulnerable students.

853
01:24:30,318 --> 01:24:50,142
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we don't wanna get into situations in which we're saying, well, if we give you that raise, we've gotta lay off this many people because I continue to believe that we can get to a place where we can have a competitive sustainable wage increase and still provide the level of staffing support that we believe is necessary to serve students in this particular moment.

854
01:24:50,942 --> 01:25:07,876
[SPEAKER_12]: But as much as we don't want to engage in some of that rhetoric, it is just a basic fact that if the strategic priority is making sure that there are staffing supports in place to be responsive to this particular moment,

855
01:25:08,516 --> 01:25:20,542
[SPEAKER_12]: And if we end up in a situation which we give wage increases that may be morally and a variety of other ways fully justified, then that will cause a deficit and there will be only one way to bridge that deficit.

856
01:25:21,122 --> 01:25:25,565
[SPEAKER_12]: And I understand that that's not a message that resonates frankly and one that I don't think it is.

857
01:25:27,059 --> 01:25:31,306
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, one that I think people in this district and many others want to debate.

858
01:25:31,686 --> 01:25:34,771
[SPEAKER_12]: And frankly, it's not a choice that I think school districts should have to make.

859
01:25:35,613 --> 01:25:40,781
[SPEAKER_12]: But I don't think I'm doing my job if I don't report that that is a choice the district has to make.

860
01:25:43,816 --> 01:25:57,641
[SPEAKER_05]: And the I guess the other question I had the last two years of the two years since I've been on the committee have been budget anomalies in terms of like what historically has happened here in Medford from a net increase of our budget.

861
01:25:58,181 --> 01:26:03,603
[SPEAKER_05]: So last year we got like a whatever was seven 8% increase something like that.

862
01:26:05,083 --> 01:26:13,567
[SPEAKER_05]: 8.2.

863
01:26:05,103 --> 01:26:13,567
[SPEAKER_05]: The year before that, we got zero in the early days of the pandemic, which we had to continue to meet all our increases.

864
01:26:13,607 --> 01:26:18,708
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was like effectively a net loss of money that we would have come in.

865
01:26:19,169 --> 01:26:21,129
[SPEAKER_05]: What is our history in Medford?

866
01:26:21,189 --> 01:26:25,331
[SPEAKER_05]: So what is a typical increase from the municipality

867
01:26:26,756 --> 01:26:27,536
[SPEAKER_12]: local contribution.

868
01:26:27,576 --> 01:26:27,716
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

869
01:26:28,016 --> 01:26:29,757
[SPEAKER_12]: So just like the average.

870
01:26:30,097 --> 01:26:30,817
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure.

871
01:26:31,057 --> 01:26:36,599
[SPEAKER_12]: The average chapter 70 increase is, as I said, it's about $140,000.

872
01:26:36,739 --> 01:26:41,481
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's a significant difference between what we're experiencing and FY 20.

873
01:26:41,541 --> 01:26:42,861
[SPEAKER_12]: I should, by the way, I should qualify that.

874
01:26:43,241 --> 01:26:46,683
[SPEAKER_12]: The $1.6 million is the governor's proposal.

875
01:26:46,723 --> 01:26:54,206
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that was in an asterisk there in the legislature right now, which typically that means that that's a good starting point.

876
01:26:55,346 --> 01:26:58,187
[SPEAKER_12]: But the state budget is not adopted yet.

877
01:26:58,267 --> 01:27:01,088
[SPEAKER_12]: So all of this is a little premature in that sense.

878
01:27:02,149 --> 01:27:04,130
[SPEAKER_12]: The average personnel

879
01:27:04,910 --> 01:27:10,194
[SPEAKER_12]: increase percentage is approximately 4% total.

880
01:27:10,235 --> 01:27:14,038
[SPEAKER_12]: That's counting the cost of living increases and the steps and lanes.

881
01:27:14,078 --> 01:27:17,581
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm doing this based off of the documentation that I inherited.

882
01:27:17,721 --> 01:27:20,403
[SPEAKER_12]: As you all know, I was not here for witnessing any of this myself.

883
01:27:20,483 --> 01:27:20,823
[SPEAKER_12]: And so, um,

884
01:27:22,024 --> 01:27:27,108
[SPEAKER_12]: keep that in mind, but that's what the personnel increases are.

885
01:27:28,048 --> 01:27:36,253
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sure if I, you know, took a break and scribbled a bunch of stuff, I could then do the math and figure out what the local contribution is, but it corresponds with those numbers essentially.

886
01:27:36,754 --> 01:27:39,736
[SPEAKER_12]: And I can provide the more detailed data if you'd like to see it.

887
01:27:39,976 --> 01:27:46,320
[SPEAKER_12]: And it is significantly smaller than the increase we saw between FY22, excuse me, FY21 and FY22.

888
01:27:46,340 --> 01:27:47,381
[SPEAKER_12]: There's no question about that.

889
01:27:48,453 --> 01:27:55,395
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that 4% would also include any additional positions that are added year to year.

890
01:27:55,555 --> 01:27:56,715
[SPEAKER_12]: That's correct.

891
01:27:56,795 --> 01:28:05,217
[SPEAKER_12]: And vice versa, if positions are eliminated in order to sustain those increases, that would also be reflected in that number.

892
01:28:05,937 --> 01:28:08,298
[SPEAKER_12]: What will be consistent is it will always drive the budget.

893
01:28:08,738 --> 01:28:13,599
[SPEAKER_12]: There will always be 80% somewhere around there with regard to personal costs.

894
01:28:13,999 --> 01:28:16,020
[SPEAKER_05]: And how many positions did we add?

895
01:28:17,093 --> 01:28:18,694
[SPEAKER_05]: from the last fiscal year, roughly?

896
01:28:18,734 --> 01:28:22,695
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like there were a good number of positions added in the last year.

897
01:28:22,755 --> 01:28:24,215
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that true?

898
01:28:24,496 --> 01:28:26,076
[SPEAKER_12]: There were positions added.

899
01:28:26,096 --> 01:28:31,238
[SPEAKER_12]: I would estimate it's in the 15 to 20 position range.

900
01:28:31,778 --> 01:28:46,203
[SPEAKER_12]: The majority of those being grant-funded positions that are specific to providing high-need, I'm using the term post-pandemic with the understanding that it's not technically over, but hopefully post-bulk of the pandemic realities that we were experiencing.

901
01:28:46,852 --> 01:28:47,152
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

902
01:28:47,492 --> 01:28:47,772
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

903
01:28:48,633 --> 01:28:49,233
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Member Graham.

904
01:28:49,253 --> 01:28:49,893
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Ruseau?

905
01:28:50,573 --> 01:28:50,893
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

906
01:28:50,954 --> 01:28:58,196
[SPEAKER_20]: I just wanted to provide a little more sort of to answer the question about our historical increases year over year.

907
01:28:58,276 --> 01:29:01,177
[SPEAKER_20]: From 2007 to 2012, we increased by 1.9% total over the course of those five years.

908
01:29:06,192 --> 01:29:08,433
[SPEAKER_12]: That was, again, before my time.

909
01:29:08,894 --> 01:29:13,296
[SPEAKER_20]: But, you know, we added $869,000 over the course of five years.

910
01:29:13,376 --> 01:29:20,881
[SPEAKER_20]: So how on earth we functioned and ran a district during that time is sort of a fascinating thing.

911
01:29:20,941 --> 01:29:22,162
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sure somebody could write a book on.

912
01:29:23,382 --> 01:29:28,646
[SPEAKER_20]: But, you know, we have plenty of years for which we not only didn't increase, but we even cut.

913
01:29:28,666 --> 01:29:29,786
[SPEAKER_20]: 2010, we cut.

914
01:29:29,806 --> 01:29:29,886
[SPEAKER_20]: 2011, we

915
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:34,701
[SPEAKER_20]: added enough to buy a copier.

916
01:29:36,342 --> 01:29:52,812
[SPEAKER_20]: So I, you know, I'm happy that since 2013, it looks like we have been doing the percentage increases that are still probably too low in my book, but at least they're not like, what is going on?

917
01:29:53,412 --> 01:30:02,198
[SPEAKER_20]: These zero percents and these cuts year over year, I don't even know how we functioned and I'm sure there's plenty of people here who were here then and could tell me, but,

918
01:30:03,507 --> 01:30:04,608
[SPEAKER_20]: It must've been interesting.

919
01:30:04,668 --> 01:30:08,251
[SPEAKER_20]: So I just did have that data and I wanted to provide some context.

920
01:30:09,072 --> 01:30:09,292
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

921
01:30:11,474 --> 01:30:11,734
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

922
01:30:13,495 --> 01:30:14,136
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

923
01:30:14,156 --> 01:30:14,836
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, mayor.

924
01:30:20,681 --> 01:30:21,802
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for your patience, everyone.

925
01:30:21,882 --> 01:30:25,445
[SPEAKER_13]: We have presentations of the public not to begin before 7 p.m.

926
01:30:26,185 --> 01:30:33,091
[SPEAKER_13]: And we have a presentation by Medford Teachers Association regarding ongoing contract negotiations with Charlene Douglas, president.

927
01:30:51,089 --> 01:30:51,529
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

928
01:30:52,430 --> 01:30:52,831
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

929
01:30:52,991 --> 01:30:53,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, everyone.

930
01:30:55,013 --> 01:30:55,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

931
01:30:58,996 --> 01:31:01,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Overwhelming and very powerful.

932
01:31:02,420 --> 01:31:03,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you all hear me?

933
01:31:03,961 --> 01:31:05,783
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I have a pretty strong voice.

934
01:31:07,224 --> 01:31:11,308
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to just give this and if you wouldn't mind just sharing it.

935
01:31:11,428 --> 01:31:13,310
[SPEAKER_22]: I shared this earlier with everyone.

936
01:31:13,706 --> 01:31:20,467
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the slide presentation I'm not going to go into in detail, but I just wanted you to have some background information, okay?

937
01:31:20,767 --> 01:31:22,007
[SPEAKER_02]: So I appreciate that, thank you.

938
01:31:22,968 --> 01:31:28,969
[SPEAKER_02]: So Charlene Douglas, 414 High Street, Meffitt Mass, President of the Meffitt Teachers Association.

939
01:31:29,629 --> 01:31:43,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Esteemed Mayor and members of the Meffitt School Committee, I am here tonight on behalf of every MTA member to voice our frustration with the delays in settling a fair contract.

940
01:31:43,976 --> 01:31:49,100
[SPEAKER_02]: Today began Teacher Appreciation Week.

941
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:58,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Yet tonight, I come before you to state that teachers feel undervalued and not respected by this district.

942
01:31:59,547 --> 01:32:09,815
[SPEAKER_02]: During the past three years of the pandemic, you have seen our educators perform exemplary work during the most challenging times that most of us have ever seen.

943
01:32:10,675 --> 01:32:12,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Method educators learn new educational

944
01:32:13,735 --> 01:32:19,937
[SPEAKER_02]: Teaching practices adapted entire curriculums to meet the ever-changing needs of students and the community.

945
01:32:20,637 --> 01:32:24,399
[SPEAKER_02]: They were available at all times of the day to support students' emotional needs.

946
01:32:24,959 --> 01:32:29,781
[SPEAKER_02]: They aided students who were struggling with remote learning or challenging home situations.

947
01:32:30,641 --> 01:32:50,855
[SPEAKER_02]: Our educators navigated through these practices to ensure that children stayed connected to school, they were there then, and they continue to be there for the children of Meffitt as we all, and I mean all of us, worked together to protect the health and safety of this community.

948
01:32:52,036 --> 01:32:55,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Meffitt schools form the backbone of this city.

949
01:32:56,820 --> 01:33:00,262
[SPEAKER_02]: That was on full display throughout this pandemic.

950
01:33:01,562 --> 01:33:04,404
[SPEAKER_02]: or the pandemic.

951
01:33:04,744 --> 01:33:17,313
[SPEAKER_02]: The pandemic has taught us how important it is to have skilled and committed workforce in our public schools, especially as teachers across the country are leaving this profession in drones.

952
01:33:18,174 --> 01:33:20,215
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wanna emphasize drones.

953
01:33:21,316 --> 01:33:28,481
[SPEAKER_02]: The lack of a fair contract and the absence of respect shown to method educators all threatened to undermine

954
01:33:28,837 --> 01:33:33,639
[SPEAKER_02]: the quality of our public schools, and that our students deserve.

955
01:33:34,059 --> 01:33:40,122
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that teachers' working conditions are students' learning conditions.

956
01:33:41,102 --> 01:33:57,209
[SPEAKER_02]: The district offered the smallest cost of living increase that we have received in the last six years, while the district received the largest increase in Chapter 70 money over the last decade.

957
01:33:58,717 --> 01:34:09,859
[SPEAKER_02]: This, while the cost of our basic needs, food on the table, gas, health insurance premiums, are going up at a rate of over 7% inflation.

958
01:34:10,979 --> 01:34:14,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Our budget shows the value of its organization.

959
01:34:14,680 --> 01:34:24,741
[SPEAKER_02]: It is clear from the way the district is treating educators at the bargaining table that they do not value the educators of this community.

960
01:34:25,842 --> 01:34:28,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Young teachers are fleeing in droves.

961
01:34:28,775 --> 01:34:35,558
[SPEAKER_02]: An average of 50% of new teachers leave in the first three years.

962
01:34:36,158 --> 01:34:44,262
[SPEAKER_02]: And our veteran colleagues are seeking employment in other districts and even going to new fields.

963
01:34:45,623 --> 01:34:56,628
[SPEAKER_02]: The federal government has provided more than $48 million to Meffitt and its school to address

964
01:34:57,998 --> 01:34:59,399
[SPEAKER_02]: the impacts of the pandemic.

965
01:35:00,239 --> 01:35:10,243
[SPEAKER_02]: The state is on track to fully fund the Student Opportunity Act and increase the funding given to our schools.

966
01:35:11,364 --> 01:35:20,268
[SPEAKER_02]: We must use these investments to benefit our students, and there is no greater resource for our students than an excellent teaching force.

967
01:35:21,058 --> 01:35:29,463
[SPEAKER_02]: In this way, the cost of living and other ways discussions are vital in continuing to meet the needs of our students.

968
01:35:30,384 --> 01:35:47,794
[SPEAKER_02]: The Method Teachers Association is seeking a fair contract that acknowledges the experience and dedication of educators currently working in the district and that will retain and continue to attract highly skilled educators.

969
01:35:48,789 --> 01:35:53,612
[SPEAKER_02]: We need a contract that meets the needs of our students in a variety of ways.

970
01:35:54,552 --> 01:36:00,895
[SPEAKER_02]: Our contract proposals were written to show our dedication to meeting the needs of our students.

971
01:36:01,836 --> 01:36:02,696
[SPEAKER_02]: What do we ask for?

972
01:36:03,277 --> 01:36:08,399
[SPEAKER_02]: We ask that the newcomers program's class size be capped to 12 students.

973
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:11,301
[SPEAKER_02]: We ask the district implement a cap.

974
01:36:12,765 --> 01:36:23,032
[SPEAKER_02]: on the number of students who receive special ed services to be less than 50% within a general education setting.

975
01:36:24,273 --> 01:36:41,185
[SPEAKER_02]: We ask that the high school teachers who work in co-teaching classrooms receive one period of a shared prep time and that teachers receive proper, and I wanna emphasize, proper training on co-teaching strategies

976
01:36:42,931 --> 01:36:51,516
[SPEAKER_02]: online, so educators will have the time and space to give students the careful attention they deserve.

977
01:36:52,997 --> 01:36:54,258
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the district's proposals

978
01:36:55,137 --> 01:37:06,909
[SPEAKER_02]: is to take away individual prep time from our elementary classroom teachers to allow for at the discretion of the principal, instructional common planning time with all grade level teachers.

979
01:37:07,469 --> 01:37:11,874
[SPEAKER_02]: Please understand, we're not opposed to common planning time.

980
01:37:12,675 --> 01:37:17,760
[SPEAKER_02]: However, it cannot come at the expense of losing individual planning time.

981
01:37:18,635 --> 01:37:39,004
[SPEAKER_02]: I have asked the elementary teachers to share with you how valuable individual individual prep time is and how they will use it to plan appropriate differentiated instructional lessons for all five subjects they teach to meet the needs of the very diverse population within the classrooms.

982
01:37:39,804 --> 01:37:46,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Tonight, we shared with each of you a packet of how teachers use their prep time.

983
01:37:46,530 --> 01:37:52,495
[SPEAKER_02]: It was also emailed to you prior this evening at this meeting as a slideshow.

984
01:37:52,995 --> 01:38:01,903
[SPEAKER_02]: When you read the packet or view the packet or the slideshow, you will learn how teachers use this valuable individual preparation time.

985
01:38:02,504 --> 01:38:06,167
[SPEAKER_02]: I ask it to review this material and urge you to support us.

986
01:38:07,511 --> 01:38:12,542
[SPEAKER_02]: All teachers deserve preparation time every day.

987
01:38:12,562 --> 01:38:16,370
[SPEAKER_02]: Not four days a week, every day.

988
01:38:30,270 --> 01:38:53,218
[SPEAKER_02]: The MTA is prepared and eager to bargain and sell a contract that will justly reflect our members' commitment to the Method public schools, and that will ensure that Method can provide the best possible education to every student attending our schools, today and in the future.

989
01:38:53,238 --> 01:38:54,959
[SPEAKER_02]: I thank you for your time.

990
01:39:27,725 --> 01:39:28,245
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Ms.

991
01:39:28,265 --> 01:39:28,685
[SPEAKER_13]: Douglas.

992
01:39:29,306 --> 01:39:31,186
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not sure if the committee has any questions.

993
01:39:31,207 --> 01:39:32,187
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm sorry.

994
01:39:32,627 --> 01:39:32,947
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

995
01:39:33,407 --> 01:39:33,808
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Ms.

996
01:39:33,828 --> 01:39:34,168
[SPEAKER_13]: Douglas.

997
01:39:34,188 --> 01:39:35,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any questions?

998
01:39:36,149 --> 01:39:37,489
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be happy to answer any questions.

999
01:39:37,569 --> 01:39:38,109
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize.

1000
01:39:40,290 --> 01:39:40,931
[SPEAKER_10]: Member McLaughlin?

1001
01:39:41,591 --> 01:39:52,436
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have a question, but I did want to just say thank you for the presentation and for the staff who put all of the information into this slide deck, because you can tell it was well thought out.

1002
01:39:52,456 --> 01:39:52,796
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1003
01:39:53,016 --> 01:39:53,276
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1004
01:39:57,241 --> 01:40:07,237
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I just wanted to thank you for your speech and for the presentation and also I wanted to mention and say thank you to all the teachers for Teacher Appreciation Week.

1005
01:40:07,558 --> 01:40:08,279
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you everybody.

1006
01:40:12,156 --> 01:40:18,281
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, miss Douglas, thank you for sending this to me and we are still in the process of going through the slide deck.

1007
01:40:18,701 --> 01:40:41,438
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you to the teachers who worked on this and submitted this so we will definitely take that under advisement and I know tomorrow there will be another negotiating session and we will continue to work in good faith and, you know, try to come to a resolution soon, so we will continue working at it but thank you, thank you for sending these materials.

1008
01:40:42,098 --> 01:40:44,721
[SPEAKER_19]: and thank you to all the teachers who worked on this packet.

1009
01:40:45,121 --> 01:40:45,501
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1010
01:40:47,143 --> 01:40:47,643
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham.

1011
01:40:48,984 --> 01:40:49,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

1012
01:40:49,184 --> 01:40:51,066
[SPEAKER_05]: Douglas, I just had one more question for you.

1013
01:40:51,626 --> 01:40:52,747
[SPEAKER_05]: I think maybe it's just me.

1014
01:40:53,748 --> 01:40:58,072
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just wanted to make sure, Dr. Edward Vincent said that you all are planning to meet tomorrow.

1015
01:40:58,212 --> 01:40:58,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.

1016
01:40:58,692 --> 01:40:58,913
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1017
01:40:59,233 --> 01:41:04,177
[SPEAKER_05]: My question, I think it's moot now, was like, are you telling us you're at impasse on these issues?

1018
01:41:04,217 --> 01:41:05,158
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think the answer

1019
01:41:05,558 --> 01:41:08,381
[SPEAKER_05]: based on what I just heard is that that conversation is continuing.

1020
01:41:08,561 --> 01:41:16,730
[SPEAKER_02]: We continue to be at the table, but we want you to realize that we feel very, very strong about some of the issues that we have brought forward.

1021
01:41:17,010 --> 01:41:26,540
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't want to get into the weeds of our negotiations, but this body, as many conciliatory

1022
01:41:28,953 --> 01:41:29,814
[SPEAKER_02]: things for you.

1023
01:41:30,154 --> 01:41:33,338
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you were looking at the Wednesday early release day.

1024
01:41:33,738 --> 01:41:34,579
[SPEAKER_02]: We came at that.

1025
01:41:35,019 --> 01:41:47,633
[SPEAKER_02]: We've given up 26 hours of our personal professional development time and everything, because we know it is important to be there for our students.

1026
01:41:48,253 --> 01:41:50,596
[SPEAKER_02]: What we are losing is remediation time.

1027
01:41:51,835 --> 01:41:54,378
[SPEAKER_02]: One of those Wednesdays, some of those Wednesdays were devoted to that.

1028
01:41:54,718 --> 01:41:55,319
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a loss.

1029
01:41:55,900 --> 01:41:56,561
[SPEAKER_02]: But we know that.

1030
01:41:57,542 --> 01:42:02,307
[SPEAKER_02]: And we did ask for something in its place, and we're close on a lot of things, okay, on that.

1031
01:42:02,968 --> 01:42:04,630
[SPEAKER_02]: But we want a decent raise.

1032
01:42:05,110 --> 01:42:06,712
[SPEAKER_02]: We really do.

1033
01:42:07,033 --> 01:42:07,894
[SPEAKER_02]: 2% isn't gonna work for us.

1034
01:42:26,974 --> 01:42:29,595
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe this is the most fun we're going to have tonight, right?

1035
01:42:29,635 --> 01:42:33,616
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was really offended to think you thought I wasn't fun.

1036
01:42:35,776 --> 01:42:38,817
[SPEAKER_02]: I always thought I was a nice person.

1037
01:42:38,857 --> 01:42:41,037
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm strong, very open-minded.

1038
01:42:41,197 --> 01:42:42,598
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be the first to admit that.

1039
01:42:42,918 --> 01:42:43,698
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know that.

1040
01:42:44,158 --> 01:42:49,659
[SPEAKER_02]: I think many of you can remember one time I told a school committee member to sit down and be quiet until I'm done talking.

1041
01:42:51,400 --> 01:42:53,620
[SPEAKER_05]: So I know that you know that that's who I am.

1042
01:42:54,180 --> 01:42:55,801
[SPEAKER_05]: So the last thing I want to say is,

1043
01:42:56,943 --> 01:43:08,746
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think because of the confidentiality we have in place, I don't think any of us are in a position to or at liberty to like respond to any of the specific things you've talked about tonight because they are supposed to be at the bargaining table.

1044
01:43:09,406 --> 01:43:15,748
[SPEAKER_05]: I would ask that you guys continue to do what you've been doing and show up to the bargaining table and be creative and work together.

1045
01:43:15,768 --> 01:43:21,429
[SPEAKER_05]: I think one of the ways we have navigated this pandemic better than so many communities is we've done that.

1046
01:43:21,889 --> 01:43:22,529
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

1047
01:43:22,789 --> 01:43:23,770
[SPEAKER_05]: I do want to say thank you.

1048
01:43:23,930 --> 01:43:25,030
[SPEAKER_05]: I know this is hard work.

1049
01:43:25,450 --> 01:43:28,051
[SPEAKER_05]: I know negotiating is never fun.

1050
01:43:28,592 --> 01:43:31,213
[SPEAKER_05]: You will never be happy at the end of a negotiation, right?

1051
01:43:31,273 --> 01:43:34,334
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just sort of the nature of a negotiation, sadly.

1052
01:43:34,354 --> 01:43:37,115
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll never be completely happy.

1053
01:43:37,195 --> 01:43:39,776
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that, so I've been negotiating for years.

1054
01:43:40,076 --> 01:43:41,337
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not my first go around.

1055
01:43:41,357 --> 01:43:42,177
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1056
01:43:42,737 --> 01:43:45,718
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and I can say honestly that

1057
01:43:47,908 --> 01:43:52,270
[SPEAKER_02]: that the benefit teacher association has a great deal of respect for the negotiation process.

1058
01:43:52,530 --> 01:43:57,353
[SPEAKER_02]: And I even think Dr. Murphy, Mr. Murphy, you are.

1059
01:43:58,894 --> 01:43:59,274
[SPEAKER_00]: Attorney.

1060
01:43:59,534 --> 01:44:01,055
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to call you professor, sorry.

1061
01:44:02,335 --> 01:44:06,157
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that Mr. Murphy even made reference to that tonight when he spoke.

1062
01:44:07,238 --> 01:44:13,081
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I do think that we will, but we do want you to be aware that there are things that

1063
01:44:13,741 --> 01:44:16,363
[SPEAKER_02]: that we're very concerned about and we wanna make sure.

1064
01:44:16,663 --> 01:44:22,947
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have, we think that, we know that there are other districts giving sizable incentives.

1065
01:44:23,007 --> 01:44:24,007
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give you one example.

1066
01:44:24,568 --> 01:44:30,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Arlington just gave every one of their teachers a bonus of $500 if they agreed to get a booster shot.

1067
01:44:30,751 --> 01:44:33,493
[SPEAKER_02]: $500 to get a booster shot.

1068
01:44:33,993 --> 01:44:34,694
[SPEAKER_02]: Ask what we got.

1069
01:44:35,254 --> 01:44:36,095
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I'm gonna say.

1070
01:44:37,515 --> 01:44:38,016
[SPEAKER_05]: So Ms.

1071
01:44:38,036 --> 01:44:39,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Douglas, just one more thing.

1072
01:44:40,799 --> 01:44:42,219
[SPEAKER_05]: She keeps trying to run away.

1073
01:44:42,239 --> 01:44:47,381
[SPEAKER_05]: So I did want to say thank you and happy Teacher Appreciation Week to all of you.

1074
01:44:48,361 --> 01:44:49,201
[SPEAKER_05]: You make a difference.

1075
01:44:49,481 --> 01:44:50,021
[SPEAKER_05]: It matters.

1076
01:44:50,301 --> 01:44:51,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

1077
01:44:51,562 --> 01:44:51,922
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1078
01:44:52,322 --> 01:44:53,082
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

1079
01:44:53,102 --> 01:44:54,582
[SPEAKER_13]: Mia, did you have a question?

1080
01:44:56,723 --> 01:44:58,723
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll stay.

1081
01:44:58,823 --> 01:45:00,964
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we all feel how Ms.

1082
01:45:00,984 --> 01:45:01,944
[SPEAKER_13]: Graham just put it.

1083
01:45:01,964 --> 01:45:09,306
[SPEAKER_13]: We appreciate our teachers more than you know, and we could go on and on, but happy Teacher Appreciation Week.

1084
01:45:09,795 --> 01:45:11,837
[SPEAKER_13]: Teacher Appreciation Week, we do appreciate you.

1085
01:45:11,877 --> 01:45:15,060
[SPEAKER_13]: We hope we can work towards a resolution to this.

1086
01:45:15,420 --> 01:45:15,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1087
01:45:17,081 --> 01:45:17,502
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone else?

1088
01:45:17,582 --> 01:45:18,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other questions?

1089
01:45:19,183 --> 01:45:19,904
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other questions?

1090
01:45:20,604 --> 01:45:20,785
[SPEAKER_02]: None?

1091
01:45:21,525 --> 01:45:21,685
[SPEAKER_02]: None?

1092
01:45:21,765 --> 01:45:25,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so I do think there's people on the floor waiting to talk on this very same topic.

1093
01:45:25,869 --> 01:45:26,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

1094
01:45:26,249 --> 01:45:26,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

1095
01:45:26,970 --> 01:45:27,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1096
01:45:39,855 --> 01:45:42,716
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, I know we have a few people, give a minute.

1097
01:45:50,940 --> 01:45:52,661
[SPEAKER_13]: If we're gonna have speakers, that's fine.

1098
01:45:52,681 --> 01:45:57,504
[SPEAKER_13]: We're just gonna give you two minutes each and I'll keep time, but name and address for the record.

1099
01:45:58,504 --> 01:45:59,865
[SPEAKER_16]: Good evening, Madam Mayor.

1100
01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:08,446
[SPEAKER_16]: Good evening, Madam Mayor, Superintendent, Dr. Morris, and school committee members.

1101
01:46:08,807 --> 01:46:12,930
[SPEAKER_16]: My name is Steven South, 106 Damon Road, Medford, Massachusetts.

1102
01:46:13,671 --> 01:46:24,001
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm a homeowner, a taxpayer, I have a child that attends Medford Public Schools, and I am also the Secretary-Treasurer of Teamsters Local 25.

1103
01:46:25,262 --> 01:46:36,782
[SPEAKER_16]: So first I wanted to thank everybody in the audience and those that could make it and those that could not make it teachers administrators security custodians.

1104
01:46:38,739 --> 01:46:55,123
[SPEAKER_16]: lunch personnel, crossing guards, everybody that works for Medford Public Schools, I know that their work is very much needed and appreciated by not just those on this side and this side of the podium, but also by the general public.

1105
01:46:55,203 --> 01:46:59,824
[SPEAKER_16]: Obviously, we couldn't educate our children without everybody, so thank you.

1106
01:47:01,705 --> 01:47:07,266
[SPEAKER_16]: Some of the things I wanted to just touch on that President Douglas touched on is, well,

1107
01:47:08,243 --> 01:47:22,629
[SPEAKER_16]: Last fall, some of you just right here behind the podium were sending out publications to all of the residents bragging about the 8.2% increase in the school budget, which is great.

1108
01:47:23,149 --> 01:47:33,494
[SPEAKER_16]: But then once we get to bargaining, and I represent the custodian security, the administrators, assistant principals, and so on and so forth,

1109
01:47:34,668 --> 01:47:50,056
[SPEAKER_16]: Once we get into bargaining all of a sudden, you know there's there's no no money to be had and I know I know that you on this side are talking about keeping things confidential but I think it's important that everyone knows that that the city or the.

1110
01:47:51,337 --> 01:47:56,163
[SPEAKER_16]: Central Administration has been proposing one or 2% raises per year.

1111
01:47:56,743 --> 01:48:07,896
[SPEAKER_16]: I know everybody has been watching the news and knows that we are in the highest inflation rates since many of us have been alive in the last 40, 50 years at 8.5% as of last month.

1112
01:48:07,916 --> 01:48:08,917
[SPEAKER_16]: That's year over year.

1113
01:48:12,601 --> 01:48:14,783
[SPEAKER_16]: and offering one or 2% raises.

1114
01:48:15,123 --> 01:48:20,788
[SPEAKER_16]: I can tell you, Local 25, we negotiate with dozens of cities and towns in the area.

1115
01:48:21,729 --> 01:48:29,095
[SPEAKER_16]: We've settled many contracts in the last 12 months, and no one has settled for 2% or anywhere near.

1116
01:48:29,155 --> 01:48:30,736
[SPEAKER_16]: We're all north of that.

1117
01:48:31,217 --> 01:48:36,701
[SPEAKER_16]: So... I do...

1118
01:48:38,971 --> 01:48:40,172
[SPEAKER_16]: I do want to be clear.

1119
01:48:40,632 --> 01:48:48,796
[SPEAKER_16]: I know President Douglas was pretty clear, but I want to be explicitly clear that none of the unions are going to settle for 2%.

1120
01:48:48,856 --> 01:48:53,678
[SPEAKER_16]: That is a pay cut when you look at inflation.

1121
01:48:54,018 --> 01:48:55,119
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not feasible.

1122
01:48:55,659 --> 01:49:02,082
[SPEAKER_16]: And I know David Murphy was talking about being competitive, but also sustainability.

1123
01:49:02,703 --> 01:49:07,385
[SPEAKER_16]: And being competitive, 2% is not even remotely competitive.

1124
01:49:08,005 --> 01:49:13,048
[SPEAKER_16]: And if you need to do 2% raises to stay afloat, that's problematic.

1125
01:49:13,448 --> 01:49:14,969
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. South.

1126
01:49:15,729 --> 01:49:16,850
[SPEAKER_13]: We have a number of speakers.

1127
01:49:17,130 --> 01:49:19,251
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll make the rest of this brief.

1128
01:49:21,452 --> 01:49:25,554
[SPEAKER_16]: Those of you up at the podium were bragging about the 8.2%.

1129
01:49:26,415 --> 01:49:35,259
[SPEAKER_16]: In this fiscal year, the central administration has been making cuts, including at the end of March when you eliminated the position of security guard.

1130
01:49:35,279 --> 01:49:36,120
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. South.

1131
01:49:36,160 --> 01:49:36,740
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. McLaughlin.

1132
01:49:36,980 --> 01:49:39,161
[SPEAKER_13]: We have also- Thank you, Mr. South, that's over three minutes.

1133
01:49:40,201 --> 01:49:41,501
[SPEAKER_13]: Would anybody else like to speak?

1134
01:49:41,842 --> 01:49:42,002
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

1135
01:49:42,062 --> 01:49:42,562
[SPEAKER_13]: O'Brien.

1136
01:49:42,642 --> 01:49:54,526
[SPEAKER_15]: We have also eliminated having security people at door 31 for after school events.

1137
01:49:54,546 --> 01:49:56,746
[SPEAKER_15]: We have three minutes, we have a rule- Mr. South.

1138
01:49:56,947 --> 01:49:57,427
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. South.

1139
01:49:57,447 --> 01:49:57,987
[SPEAKER_15]: Over a year.

1140
01:49:58,467 --> 01:49:58,727
[SPEAKER_13]: Mayor.

1141
01:49:58,827 --> 01:50:00,228
[SPEAKER_15]: Over a year.

1142
01:50:00,388 --> 01:50:01,168
[SPEAKER_14]: Member Ruseau.

1143
01:51:02,570 --> 01:51:04,611
[SPEAKER_20]: but only half of us have to abide by them.

1144
01:51:05,111 --> 01:51:11,693
[SPEAKER_20]: So when we are asked questions that we cannot answer, because that would be a Department of Labor violation, that's fine.

1145
01:51:11,993 --> 01:51:18,934
[SPEAKER_20]: But when the other side wants to violate those same rules, we don't say boo, we don't contact the Department of Labor over it.

1146
01:51:19,315 --> 01:51:22,555
[SPEAKER_20]: Instead, you get to like, say whatever you want, and we can't respond.

1147
01:51:22,975 --> 01:51:25,176
[SPEAKER_20]: Because if we respond, that's against the law.

1148
01:51:25,556 --> 01:51:28,557
[SPEAKER_20]: So I want the rules that were agreed to for this bargaining

1149
01:51:28,917 --> 01:51:35,901
[SPEAKER_20]: to be publicly available so that when they are violated by anyone, including us, everybody knows what's really going on.

1150
01:51:36,121 --> 01:51:51,010
[SPEAKER_20]: Because this is just, this is the same thing from the last time we had bargaining where I left the bargaining table because members of the bargaining table, not on the school committee, went on Facebook and talked about what was going on in the bargaining room, which is a violation of trust.

1151
01:51:51,130 --> 01:51:53,392
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think trust is critical to a good bargaining.

1152
01:51:53,892 --> 01:51:56,073
[SPEAKER_20]: So I want, there's a motion and a second.

1153
01:51:56,634 --> 01:51:57,574
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't want a conversation.

1154
01:51:57,594 --> 01:51:58,575
[SPEAKER_20]: There's a motion and a second.

1155
01:51:59,966 --> 01:52:00,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor.

1156
01:52:00,527 --> 01:52:01,207
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham.

1157
01:52:01,948 --> 01:52:14,322
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I, before we take this vote, can I ask Dr. Edward Benson and Mr. Murphy to weigh in on this motion about making the rules of engagement of negotiations public?

1158
01:52:15,919 --> 01:52:26,647
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I'm gonna just have Mr. Murphy come forward as well, because I feel that we've been making progress, and I think we just need to honor both sides, honor the rules of engagement.

1159
01:52:26,667 --> 01:52:29,248
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Murphy, can you please weigh in?

1160
01:52:29,429 --> 01:52:29,789
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure.

1161
01:52:30,129 --> 01:52:31,490
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Superintendent.

1162
01:52:31,510 --> 01:52:34,392
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, members of the committee, Mr. Soka, or whoever, Ms.

1163
01:52:34,412 --> 01:52:35,072
[SPEAKER_12]: Graham, for the question.

1164
01:52:36,714 --> 01:52:37,714
[SPEAKER_12]: What I would say is that

1165
01:52:39,386 --> 01:52:46,096
[SPEAKER_12]: The ground rules and all proposals that are exchanged are documents between the parties.

1166
01:52:46,777 --> 01:52:55,750
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I would advise against a unilateral action on the part of the district via a vote of the school committee to make anything specific public, because

1167
01:52:56,431 --> 01:53:03,975
[SPEAKER_12]: for each bargaining unit, I would want to confer with the people we're negotiating with before we just release anything publicly.

1168
01:53:05,256 --> 01:53:06,797
[SPEAKER_12]: I will just be candid.

1169
01:53:07,678 --> 01:53:15,022
[SPEAKER_12]: There's some frustration that's been expressed by the committee that is shared by the administration with regard to some of the specificity.

1170
01:53:15,642 --> 01:53:24,348
[SPEAKER_12]: As I mentioned, I think identifying a specific proposal out of context in a vacuum can be misleading, which is why

1171
01:53:25,248 --> 01:53:26,169
[SPEAKER_12]: that we haven't done it.

1172
01:53:26,789 --> 01:53:49,484
[SPEAKER_12]: And I would ask the committee's indulgence to allow us to continue to not do that, because regardless of wherever the rhetoric lands or information that is presented to you as factual, that may or may not be, we are going to continue to abide by the confidentiality that we as a team believe will lead to a more constructive resolution.

1173
01:53:50,146 --> 01:53:51,086
[SPEAKER_12]: of what we're negotiating.

1174
01:53:51,166 --> 01:54:03,410
[SPEAKER_12]: So I share the committee's frustration and I respect and understand the frustration on the part of our bargaining partners with regard to the timeline as well as some other issues.

1175
01:54:04,210 --> 01:54:12,853
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think my recommendation to the committee and frankly to everyone would be that we get back to the bargaining table and continue to negotiate in good faith.

1176
01:54:13,653 --> 01:54:13,953
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1177
01:54:16,714 --> 01:54:17,394
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

1178
01:54:19,583 --> 01:54:21,403
[SPEAKER_20]: Mayor, if I may?

1179
01:54:22,143 --> 01:54:23,024
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Rossell.

1180
01:54:23,784 --> 01:54:31,445
[SPEAKER_20]: I guess, I don't really know what the point of rules are if they are not followed by one half of the people at the table.

1181
01:54:32,625 --> 01:54:41,127
[SPEAKER_20]: And I see somebody shaking her head who went to Facebook after the last collective bargaining agreement and session that I was in and divulged everything that was being discussed.

1182
01:54:41,707 --> 01:54:47,888
[SPEAKER_20]: It's, you know, the community, we're the seven people that get beat up and you can say anything you want,

1183
01:54:49,403 --> 01:54:53,485
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not saying everybody's lying, but you also can say anything you want.

1184
01:54:53,625 --> 01:54:56,206
[SPEAKER_20]: And we can't even respond to the emails.

1185
01:54:56,806 --> 01:54:58,587
[SPEAKER_20]: We can say, thank you for your email.

1186
01:54:58,867 --> 01:54:59,987
[SPEAKER_20]: We like our teachers too.

1187
01:55:00,027 --> 01:55:01,388
[SPEAKER_20]: And we think they should get a big raise.

1188
01:55:01,628 --> 01:55:02,529
[SPEAKER_20]: That's how I respond.

1189
01:55:03,629 --> 01:55:05,970
[SPEAKER_20]: But you could say, we offered you zero, zero, zero.

1190
01:55:07,090 --> 01:55:08,491
[SPEAKER_20]: And I couldn't respond and say, you asked for 20%, 20%, 20%.

1191
01:55:09,111 --> 01:55:11,992
[SPEAKER_20]: That would be against the law for me to do that.

1192
01:55:13,113 --> 01:55:17,475
[SPEAKER_20]: So I just don't know what the point of bargaining partners are that aren't actually partners.

1193
01:55:19,952 --> 01:55:42,386
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll withdraw this because I recognize that the motion as I put it was for all the bargaining agreement, bargaining partners, but I just would be nice if the other side of the table respected the process that they agreed upon, because we respect that process by staying silent and allowing the bargaining to happen according to the law.

1194
01:55:43,561 --> 01:55:44,782
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Member Ruseau.

1195
01:55:44,982 --> 01:55:45,082
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

1196
01:55:45,102 --> 01:55:45,442
[SPEAKER_13]: O'Brien.

1197
01:55:45,642 --> 01:55:51,365
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, my name is Hannah O'Brien and I was a paraprofessional at the Roberts Elementary School for the past five years.

1198
01:55:51,385 --> 01:55:53,446
[SPEAKER_06]: I know many of you, I love many of you.

1199
01:55:54,406 --> 01:55:55,487
[SPEAKER_06]: I resigned about a month ago.

1200
01:55:56,067 --> 01:55:58,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Resigning was the hardest decision I've ever had to make.

1201
01:55:58,888 --> 01:56:02,130
[SPEAKER_06]: I was stuck between doing something that I love and not being able to survive.

1202
01:56:03,143 --> 01:56:11,474
[SPEAKER_06]: No working person working a full-time job, especially as demanding as it is for us, should struggle to pay their mortgage, their groceries, and their gas.

1203
01:56:11,494 --> 01:56:12,475
[SPEAKER_06]: $515 biweekly.

1204
01:56:12,495 --> 01:56:14,057
[SPEAKER_06]: $51 a day I was given with a college degree.

1205
01:56:20,270 --> 01:56:24,813
[SPEAKER_06]: to come to work and be an essential asset to our most vulnerable students.

1206
01:56:25,473 --> 01:56:32,498
[SPEAKER_06]: Despite these conditions, I kept showing up because I thought of the student who wouldn't be able to succeed in the general ed classroom without me.

1207
01:56:32,978 --> 01:56:36,801
[SPEAKER_06]: The student who was told that they shouldn't be in the placement they are because of their abilities.

1208
01:56:37,582 --> 01:56:42,565
[SPEAKER_06]: The student who lost their home to eviction and needed some extra love to make it through the day without a mental breakdown.

1209
01:56:43,085 --> 01:56:49,710
[SPEAKER_06]: The student who gave me a concussion because they have so much anger and anxiety coming to school and acting like things are normal after a global pandemic.

1210
01:56:50,230 --> 01:56:50,307
you

1211
01:56:50,421 --> 01:56:52,102
[SPEAKER_06]: Things are not normal.

1212
01:56:52,502 --> 01:57:03,910
[SPEAKER_06]: Schools are going to continue to be the brunt of the mental health epidemic if you can't open your eyes and your wallets and realize that educators standing behind me are shaping the way for our students to function in society.

1213
01:57:04,570 --> 01:57:10,675
[SPEAKER_06]: Teachers and support staff have worked harder than ever to ensure our students return to school as smoothly as possible.

1214
01:57:11,155 --> 01:57:20,361
[SPEAKER_06]: Instead of giving these workers what they deserve, which is more, you are taking and putting more on their caseloads, which I see every single day going to work, how much they're doing.

1215
01:57:21,722 --> 01:57:26,744
[SPEAKER_06]: You continue to push testing despite many kids not at grade level in academics right now.

1216
01:57:27,304 --> 01:57:36,748
[SPEAKER_06]: I was heartbroken to see five and six year olds having anxiety attacks over the multiple testing they didn't understand because they were required to take and we weren't able to help them.

1217
01:57:37,589 --> 01:57:39,510
[SPEAKER_06]: When will you recognize that students need to be

1218
01:57:40,570 --> 01:57:44,295
[SPEAKER_06]: accumulated with basic skills again in order to function in a classroom setting.

1219
01:57:44,775 --> 01:57:55,187
[SPEAKER_06]: Why are we pretending like the last three years didn't happen and our students just know how to live again after being scared for so long, especially for our youngest learners who don't remember a time without

1220
01:57:55,908 --> 01:57:56,749
[SPEAKER_06]: things happening.

1221
01:57:56,769 --> 01:58:02,732
[SPEAKER_06]: I started a new job two weeks ago and I haven't had to beg my bosses to meet with me like I had to do in Medford.

1222
01:58:03,292 --> 01:58:06,214
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been invited to make decisions like I wasn't in Medford.

1223
01:58:06,634 --> 01:58:15,279
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been told how valued I am, not by just writing a Facebook post during Teacher Appreciation Week, but by actually showing me with their actions and their pay.

1224
01:58:15,820 --> 01:58:18,481
[SPEAKER_06]: So for you on the committee, my question for you is simple.

1225
01:58:18,821 --> 01:58:21,283
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want to continue to lose people who care?

1226
01:58:22,603 --> 01:58:26,125
[SPEAKER_06]: those who don't just come for a paycheck, but show up because they love what they do.

1227
01:58:26,626 --> 01:58:31,448
[SPEAKER_06]: You have a decision to make, and I hope you choose the one that is in the best interest of our students.

1228
01:58:31,668 --> 01:58:32,609
[SPEAKER_06]: I will leave you with this.

1229
01:58:33,329 --> 01:58:36,011
[SPEAKER_06]: One parent wrote me this letter on my last day of work.

1230
01:58:36,591 --> 01:58:36,771
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

1231
01:58:36,851 --> 01:58:46,957
[SPEAKER_06]: O'Brien, we didn't know when this school year started how things would go with blank student, but once we knew there was someone as special as you looking after our daughter, we knew everything would be okay.

1232
01:58:47,537 --> 01:58:50,279
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much for caring about our little girl so deeply.

1233
01:58:51,079 --> 01:58:56,141
[SPEAKER_06]: all the ways you went above and beyond to make school accessible for her and recognizing all she has to offer.

1234
01:58:56,641 --> 01:58:59,863
[SPEAKER_06]: Your words of affirmation have made all the difference to her and to us.

1235
01:59:00,183 --> 01:59:03,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Her world is so much bigger as a result of you being in it.

1236
01:59:03,324 --> 01:59:04,565
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Ms.

1237
01:59:04,605 --> 01:59:04,885
[SPEAKER_13]: O'Brien.

1238
01:59:27,520 --> 01:59:29,841
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi, I'm Max Heinegg, 5 Arden Road.

1239
01:59:29,921 --> 01:59:35,384
[SPEAKER_18]: I was approached by a group of veteran teachers because I've been teaching in Bedford for 24 years.

1240
01:59:35,404 --> 01:59:38,085
[SPEAKER_18]: And they asked if I would read this and I read it and I said, yes, I would.

1241
01:59:38,805 --> 01:59:46,729
[SPEAKER_18]: And afterwards, I was also told that if you would like a copy of it, we'll submit a copy of it with us, with signatures on it.

1242
01:59:47,430 --> 01:59:54,053
[SPEAKER_18]: I took out a few things from what I was given because I didn't want to repeat some of the stuff that everyone has already said, because I want to respect everyone's time.

1243
01:59:55,033 --> 02:00:12,368
[SPEAKER_18]: but I'd like to address the school committee, the mayor and the superintendent, and say I'm glad to be here to speak as somebody who's been teaching in Medford for, you know, 24 years, teaching sixth grade, 10th grade, 12th grade, coached boys and girls, tennis to the literary magazine, created the mantra for the school, and just basically, I love going to work.

1244
02:00:13,308 --> 02:00:18,693
[SPEAKER_18]: Over the past three years of the pandemic, we, and I'm sorry, I didn't wear red, I just made dinner.

1245
02:00:20,321 --> 02:00:22,522
[SPEAKER_18]: have stepped up in, we think, unprecedented ways.

1246
02:00:22,602 --> 02:00:25,004
[SPEAKER_18]: We revised the curriculum to meet the changing needs of the students.

1247
02:00:25,084 --> 02:00:27,986
[SPEAKER_18]: All of us learned how to use all sorts of different new apps.

1248
02:00:28,006 --> 02:00:29,447
[SPEAKER_18]: Some of us are not as computer savvy.

1249
02:00:29,467 --> 02:00:33,610
[SPEAKER_18]: We're just basically going back to school for all that, and then immediately evaluated on our use of it.

1250
02:00:34,131 --> 02:00:39,315
[SPEAKER_18]: We are available at all hours to help students who are struggling due to stress.

1251
02:00:39,535 --> 02:00:40,335
[SPEAKER_18]: We were stressed too.

1252
02:00:40,395 --> 02:00:41,416
[SPEAKER_18]: They were stressed.

1253
02:00:41,456 --> 02:00:42,337
[SPEAKER_18]: We had colleagues die.

1254
02:00:43,516 --> 02:00:44,536
[SPEAKER_18]: right, because of COVID.

1255
02:00:45,197 --> 02:00:53,801
[SPEAKER_18]: And we're, meanwhile, like getting on Zooms and making, you know, trying to make people feel comfortable who didn't want to show their families, you know, homes on Zoom and still being like, let's get on the Zoom.

1256
02:00:54,401 --> 02:01:00,944
[SPEAKER_18]: And we Zoomed together, and we bought the stuff we needed, and we bought the technology to make, you know, do the best we could with hybrid learning.

1257
02:01:01,775 --> 02:01:04,237
[SPEAKER_18]: Now we find ourselves working without a contract for almost a full year.

1258
02:01:04,937 --> 02:01:06,839
[SPEAKER_18]: Find ourselves without a raise when inflation is almost 8%.

1259
02:01:07,159 --> 02:01:12,363
[SPEAKER_18]: We find ourselves working multiple jobs to make ends meet, especially a lot of the younger teachers.

1260
02:01:12,403 --> 02:01:13,544
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, I'm an older teacher.

1261
02:01:13,604 --> 02:01:19,528
[SPEAKER_18]: So like, I'm happy, you know, in general with, I'm not, you know, I don't want to say too much because we are here to talk about the contract.

1262
02:01:19,588 --> 02:01:21,410
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you know what I mean?

1263
02:01:21,490 --> 02:01:29,076
[SPEAKER_18]: But like, obviously the younger teachers that I'm really making enough money and many of them, like my coworkers drive Lyft, like they, you know, they leave work to go to work.

1264
02:01:31,243 --> 02:01:32,624
[SPEAKER_18]: We find ourselves losing prep time.

1265
02:01:33,144 --> 02:01:41,769
[SPEAKER_18]: I substituted today, I substitute basically one out of every, you know, two or three preps that I have, I'm basically substituting because we haven't hired enough substitute teachers.

1266
02:01:42,329 --> 02:01:45,771
[SPEAKER_18]: Students are wandering the hall because there's enough support staff to monitor the corridors.

1267
02:01:46,371 --> 02:01:54,596
[SPEAKER_18]: Almost every one of my classes begins with me looking out and recognizing who I know in the audience, meaning the hallway and saying like, hey everybody, like, can we get where we're going?

1268
02:01:55,276 --> 02:01:59,939
[SPEAKER_18]: And that, you know, that takes away from time and it makes it seem like a less serious enterprise that we're engaged in.

1269
02:02:00,902 --> 02:02:13,132
[SPEAKER_18]: So, you know, the general feeling is that a lot of us feel unsupported and that we feel like even the administrators we work with are so busy and hairy that they can't deal with the multiple tasks they're trying to deal with.

1270
02:02:13,393 --> 02:02:19,718
[SPEAKER_18]: We see a lot of our colleagues approaching their work with fear, not love and joy, and just stress, stress, right?

1271
02:02:20,759 --> 02:02:25,002
[SPEAKER_18]: Twice this month, teachers have gathered outside the building by the flagpole to let

1272
02:02:25,848 --> 02:02:30,752
[SPEAKER_18]: you know, by the Vietnam Memorial to let the community know of our struggles and to build awareness.

1273
02:02:31,252 --> 02:02:36,157
[SPEAKER_18]: But we haven't seen the school committee members, the elected stewards, step into the building and ask the teachers what's wrong.

1274
02:02:36,257 --> 02:02:44,584
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, I know that that is phrased in like a, you know, I like to say like, please come visit, you know, like we welcome the opportunity to speak with you about it.

1275
02:02:52,125 --> 02:02:59,450
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, similarly we haven't seen people from central coming around like you know in the hallway and saying like hey kids get to class and just saying like how's it going here.

1276
02:03:01,112 --> 02:03:07,757
[SPEAKER_18]: Not that monitoring the hallways isn't a part of the gig, it is a part of the gig, but it's still too much part of the gig and we'd like to focus more on teaching.

1277
02:03:09,086 --> 02:03:11,827
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd like to focus at the end on just the bright note.

1278
02:03:11,867 --> 02:03:14,848
[SPEAKER_18]: The good news, such as it is, is that none of these issues are irreparable.

1279
02:03:15,288 --> 02:03:32,354
[SPEAKER_18]: But getting Medford back on track, supporting our teachers so that they can support the children, and making Medford a place where people want to work and live will take everybody's active engagement, real partnerships between all of us, from school committee to central administration, to building administrators, to teachers, and support staff.

1280
02:03:32,894 --> 02:03:38,403
[SPEAKER_18]: active and open communication, and a real will to do right by our teachers, our students, and our community.

1281
02:03:38,844 --> 02:03:42,590
[SPEAKER_18]: Signed, yours in education, the veteran teachers of the Medford Public Schools.

1282
02:03:56,083 --> 02:03:57,144
[SPEAKER_21]: My name is Mr. Milne.

1283
02:03:57,944 --> 02:04:05,306
[SPEAKER_21]: I had 31 of the most rewarding years of my life teaching for our school systems, and I've had many of your children.

1284
02:04:06,606 --> 02:04:09,727
[SPEAKER_21]: And I wanna talk about something- Just address for the record, please, your address.

1285
02:04:10,447 --> 02:04:11,148
[SPEAKER_21]: Address for the record.

1286
02:04:11,248 --> 02:04:12,488
[SPEAKER_21]: No, 51 Quincy Street, Medford.

1287
02:04:13,508 --> 02:04:17,049
[SPEAKER_21]: I wanna talk about something that doesn't cost you a cent.

1288
02:04:20,150 --> 02:04:22,891
[SPEAKER_21]: It's about being nice and being appreciative.

1289
02:04:24,449 --> 02:04:30,873
[SPEAKER_21]: And the people behind me were at work about seven o'clock this morning, working hard.

1290
02:04:31,474 --> 02:04:34,376
[SPEAKER_21]: We hit the COVID iceberg.

1291
02:04:35,897 --> 02:04:38,078
[SPEAKER_21]: We didn't want to, but it happened.

1292
02:04:39,899 --> 02:04:41,220
[SPEAKER_21]: And we need to address it.

1293
02:04:42,761 --> 02:04:44,642
[SPEAKER_21]: These people have been up since seven o'clock.

1294
02:04:46,143 --> 02:04:50,926
[SPEAKER_21]: Many of them have to go home and prepare for tomorrow and then do it all over again tomorrow.

1295
02:04:51,547 --> 02:04:52,688
[SPEAKER_21]: Doesn't cost us a cent.

1296
02:04:53,757 --> 02:04:55,779
[SPEAKER_21]: I propose we stand up and appreciate them.

1297
02:04:56,199 --> 02:04:57,801
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you to everyone.

1298
02:05:08,970 --> 02:05:13,895
[SPEAKER_21]: I think many of you have been reading Chris Huffaker's article in the Boston Globe.

1299
02:05:14,495 --> 02:05:18,539
[SPEAKER_21]: And let me just point out the most chilling fact that he put in there.

1300
02:05:20,497 --> 02:05:29,843
[SPEAKER_21]: 44% of Massachusetts teachers have stated that they plan on leaving teaching in the next two years.

1301
02:05:31,264 --> 02:05:39,831
[SPEAKER_21]: As you know, I retired in June, so I'm in this position where I have excellent contact with my colleagues, but I'm no longer working.

1302
02:05:40,871 --> 02:05:41,912
[SPEAKER_21]: I can be confidential.

1303
02:05:43,874 --> 02:05:46,716
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you realize how many teachers we are losing?

1304
02:05:48,055 --> 02:05:53,756
[SPEAKER_21]: And if you look out in this audience, one department in particular, we don't see any of them.

1305
02:05:56,677 --> 02:05:57,097
[SPEAKER_21]: Why?

1306
02:05:57,537 --> 02:05:58,577
[SPEAKER_21]: Because they're planning on leaving.

1307
02:05:59,057 --> 02:05:59,898
[SPEAKER_21]: They've been bullied.

1308
02:06:00,818 --> 02:06:04,398
[SPEAKER_21]: And there's been a homophobic level of it, and it hasn't been addressed.

1309
02:06:04,959 --> 02:06:07,699
[SPEAKER_21]: So we're making their jobs even worse.

1310
02:06:08,699 --> 02:06:09,720
[SPEAKER_21]: We don't need to do that.

1311
02:06:10,280 --> 02:06:11,160
[SPEAKER_21]: We don't need to do that.

1312
02:06:12,011 --> 02:06:14,233
[SPEAKER_21]: We've got the wrong trifecta going.

1313
02:06:14,874 --> 02:06:16,155
[SPEAKER_21]: We're overworking them.

1314
02:06:16,476 --> 02:06:29,309
[SPEAKER_21]: How many of you non-teachers have sat down with a teacher about the existential crisis that they go through when their preparatory time is taken away?

1315
02:06:29,769 --> 02:06:31,031
[SPEAKER_21]: How many of you have done it?

1316
02:06:32,691 --> 02:06:34,192
[SPEAKER_21]: Let me walk you through it real quick.

1317
02:06:34,673 --> 02:06:36,634
[SPEAKER_21]: I was a history psychology teacher.

1318
02:06:37,234 --> 02:06:41,618
[SPEAKER_21]: I'd go into the office in the morning and I'd be told I'm teaching a Spanish class.

1319
02:06:42,679 --> 02:06:45,201
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't speak much Spanish, like three words.

1320
02:06:47,062 --> 02:06:53,267
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you know how demoralizing that is to me as professional that wants to do the right thing?

1321
02:06:53,287 --> 02:06:55,609
[SPEAKER_21]: And then it gets worse.

1322
02:06:57,185 --> 02:07:04,852
[SPEAKER_21]: I stayed up at night preparing, writing a test, or doing something, and that was my period for photocopying it.

1323
02:07:05,333 --> 02:07:07,074
[SPEAKER_21]: I see Mr. Wildness out there.

1324
02:07:07,855 --> 02:07:09,056
[SPEAKER_21]: Chemistry's not easy.

1325
02:07:09,456 --> 02:07:11,238
[SPEAKER_21]: Setting up a lab is not easy.

1326
02:07:12,539 --> 02:07:23,269
[SPEAKER_21]: And when that time period is taken away all of a sudden, and you have the kids read to do the lab, and then they can't do it, that's demoralizing again.

1327
02:07:25,703 --> 02:07:27,223
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, I have one question for you.

1328
02:07:28,644 --> 02:07:30,124
[SPEAKER_21]: How are we gonna replace these people?

1329
02:07:34,965 --> 02:07:39,765
[SPEAKER_21]: The number one issue and the number one needs we need to meet are the children's needs.

1330
02:07:40,606 --> 02:07:50,707
[SPEAKER_21]: You are gonna be in a crisis next year when your kids do not have teachers, especially in one department, which is MCAS tested.

1331
02:07:51,567 --> 02:07:53,088
[SPEAKER_21]: You're gonna be in big trouble.

1332
02:07:53,108 --> 02:07:54,728
[SPEAKER_21]: You are gonna get a lot of calls.

1333
02:07:56,141 --> 02:07:58,622
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, let me address the elephant in the room.

1334
02:07:59,383 --> 02:08:02,744
[SPEAKER_21]: I was a little bit disappointed in the way this meeting began.

1335
02:08:03,264 --> 02:08:11,628
[SPEAKER_21]: These people got up at seven, have to get up at seven tomorrow again and be at work, and we're talking about corrugated pipes.

1336
02:08:17,051 --> 02:08:20,873
[SPEAKER_21]: I have served for other mayors, other superintendents,

1337
02:08:21,866 --> 02:08:24,448
[SPEAKER_21]: other school committees, and that would have not have happened.

1338
02:08:24,828 --> 02:08:26,290
[SPEAKER_21]: That was wrong.

1339
02:08:27,210 --> 02:08:36,277
[SPEAKER_21]: And the first meeting of the school year for the teachers this year, and last year on my 31 years, was the worst year teaching.

1340
02:08:37,078 --> 02:08:39,260
[SPEAKER_21]: It was the hardest year teaching.

1341
02:08:40,020 --> 02:08:41,341
[SPEAKER_21]: It took my soul.

1342
02:08:41,361 --> 02:08:44,904
[SPEAKER_21]: And what was the first meeting about this year?

1343
02:08:44,924 --> 02:08:48,007
[SPEAKER_21]: We're gonna begin the evaluation process.

1344
02:08:49,841 --> 02:08:50,961
[SPEAKER_21]: That was wrong.

1345
02:08:51,802 --> 02:08:52,802
[SPEAKER_21]: That was wrong.

1346
02:08:53,342 --> 02:08:54,963
[SPEAKER_21]: We can do better that in Medford.

1347
02:08:55,303 --> 02:08:56,324
[SPEAKER_21]: We are better.

1348
02:08:56,684 --> 02:08:58,764
[SPEAKER_21]: We have a wonderful adaptive program.

1349
02:08:58,885 --> 02:08:59,965
[SPEAKER_21]: I got calls this week.

1350
02:09:00,265 --> 02:09:02,526
[SPEAKER_21]: We have a Brazilian kid going to Harvard.

1351
02:09:02,886 --> 02:09:05,687
[SPEAKER_21]: We have a Haitian kid who is going to Tufts.

1352
02:09:06,267 --> 02:09:11,209
[SPEAKER_21]: We have more kids going to the prestigious schools than Winchester does.

1353
02:09:11,549 --> 02:09:17,732
[SPEAKER_21]: And we have a vocational school that most communities don't even have and can't match.

1354
02:09:18,092 --> 02:09:19,834
[SPEAKER_21]: We have a lot to be proud of.

1355
02:09:20,655 --> 02:09:22,897
[SPEAKER_21]: And we can do better than we have just done.

1356
02:09:22,917 --> 02:09:24,799
[SPEAKER_21]: We can do better.

1357
02:09:24,819 --> 02:09:25,720
[SPEAKER_21]: We are Medford.

1358
02:09:26,581 --> 02:09:27,541
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. Milne.

1359
02:09:33,848 --> 02:09:37,471
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Milne, that was three minutes.

1360
02:09:37,491 --> 02:09:40,835
[SPEAKER_21]: So my last statement is, this is not the time to bottom dollar it.

1361
02:09:42,370 --> 02:09:45,152
[SPEAKER_21]: and we're gonna have a huge exodus whether you like it or not.

1362
02:09:45,452 --> 02:09:52,396
[SPEAKER_21]: They're moving into other professions and they're moving to wealthier, wider suburbs.

1363
02:09:52,616 --> 02:09:53,496
[SPEAKER_21]: Have you ever done this?

1364
02:09:53,877 --> 02:09:58,659
[SPEAKER_21]: Have you ever counted how many former Medford teachers teach at Newton North?

1365
02:09:59,400 --> 02:09:59,940
[SPEAKER_21]: Go do it.

1366
02:10:03,762 --> 02:10:06,364
[SPEAKER_21]: And many of our best and many,

1367
02:10:07,620 --> 02:10:09,221
[SPEAKER_21]: of our former teachers of color.

1368
02:10:10,181 --> 02:10:12,403
[SPEAKER_21]: Everything about that equation is wrong.

1369
02:10:12,943 --> 02:10:14,404
[SPEAKER_21]: We can do better than that.

1370
02:10:14,424 --> 02:10:17,525
[SPEAKER_21]: And it doesn't really come about money.

1371
02:10:18,466 --> 02:10:19,687
[SPEAKER_21]: It's about appreciation.

1372
02:10:21,067 --> 02:10:23,169
[SPEAKER_21]: How many of you had lunch with teachers?

1373
02:10:23,969 --> 02:10:26,731
[SPEAKER_21]: How many of you meet with them, talk with them?

1374
02:10:29,852 --> 02:10:34,375
[SPEAKER_21]: Please value the primary relationship

1375
02:10:35,655 --> 02:10:38,277
[SPEAKER_21]: of our town, which is what?

1376
02:10:38,738 --> 02:10:39,998
[SPEAKER_21]: Student teacher.

1377
02:10:40,559 --> 02:10:41,199
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you for listening.

1378
02:10:41,239 --> 02:10:41,560
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1379
02:11:00,014 --> 02:11:00,154
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep.

1380
02:11:00,574 --> 02:11:01,755
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address for the record, please.

1381
02:11:02,215 --> 02:11:04,357
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, just hold on one second.

1382
02:11:05,255 --> 02:11:05,555
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1383
02:11:05,675 --> 02:11:09,497
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll say Sean being in 362 Lawrence Road, Medford.

1384
02:11:10,217 --> 02:11:15,439
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am a parent of two children at the high school, I'll have a third child in a couple years going to the high school.

1385
02:11:16,439 --> 02:11:24,042
[SPEAKER_01]: And my interest in this and in all school committee matters is strictly child related and child focus.

1386
02:11:24,522 --> 02:11:24,662
[SPEAKER_01]: So,

1387
02:11:25,609 --> 02:11:34,334
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the kids in this city, as they have everywhere across the country, have had just a horrendous two years, and it's not the teacher's fault.

1388
02:11:35,174 --> 02:11:36,775
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just what we went through.

1389
02:11:37,796 --> 02:11:51,163
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, and I hope that this isn't going to be the next crisis that the kids have on their brains, because I know I've already started to hear, coming back to my house, the teachers aren't happy, the teachers were picketing.

1390
02:11:51,843 --> 02:11:54,845
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not saying they shouldn't do that or blaming them for doing that,

1391
02:11:56,147 --> 02:11:59,590
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be another source of anxiety for these kids.

1392
02:12:00,791 --> 02:12:03,833
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've heard a lot of hyperbole tonight.

1393
02:12:03,933 --> 02:12:10,138
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard of some grandstanding tonight from certain people who represent union interests.

1394
02:12:11,298 --> 02:12:17,103
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've heard, you know, about some pretty specific, I guess, negotiations.

1395
02:12:17,163 --> 02:12:24,168
[SPEAKER_01]: And to Councilor Rousseau's point, it must be frustrating to sit there and not be able to respond, I imagine.

1396
02:12:25,911 --> 02:12:35,114
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that the two sides will come together very quickly and not let this get any further than it has gone tonight already.

1397
02:12:35,774 --> 02:12:43,357
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope some of the things that Mr. Milne saying about teachers leaving is, I hope it's exaggerated, frankly, because I really hope that doesn't happen.

1398
02:12:44,454 --> 02:12:49,416
[SPEAKER_01]: Some great teachers here, and my daughters have had some great experiences in the Medford schools.

1399
02:12:49,456 --> 02:12:52,298
[SPEAKER_01]: My oldest will be going to Boston College next year.

1400
02:12:52,318 --> 02:12:54,579
[SPEAKER_01]: And I heard Dr. Wadness's name mentioned.

1401
02:12:55,279 --> 02:12:59,561
[SPEAKER_01]: Lily has Dr. Wadness this year, and that's been a great class for her.

1402
02:13:00,341 --> 02:13:09,086
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hope that maybe as we're going through these negotiations, as you're going through these negotiations tomorrow, just keep the kids in mind as well.

1403
02:13:10,697 --> 02:13:12,079
[SPEAKER_01]: Clearly, this is a money issue.

1404
02:13:12,799 --> 02:13:14,161
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's come to a compromise.

1405
02:13:14,742 --> 02:13:17,745
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you're not as far apart as you probably think you are.

1406
02:13:17,765 --> 02:13:21,429
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's make a goal to get this wrapped up very quickly.

1407
02:13:21,649 --> 02:13:21,970
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1408
02:13:21,990 --> 02:13:23,511
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1409
02:13:23,632 --> 02:13:24,793
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1410
02:13:27,476 --> 02:13:28,257
[SPEAKER_09]: Member McLaughlin?

1411
02:13:30,119 --> 02:13:30,419
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1412
02:13:30,499 --> 02:13:31,140
[SPEAKER_09]: Member McLaughlin?

1413
02:13:31,598 --> 02:13:31,958
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1414
02:13:32,018 --> 02:13:54,827
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to thank folks who came up to the podium to speak tonight because I know that's not always easy and also did also want to say a lot of the teachers in the audience have been teachers to my children and I want to thank you and thank teachers for the during teacher appreciation week, but and also say thank you for the invitation tonight for Mr. Heinegg and for others and

1415
02:13:55,680 --> 02:14:05,847
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it's a great opportunity and welcome the opportunity, but also the invitation is really important because we can't just show up and come into classrooms.

1416
02:14:06,727 --> 02:14:07,748
[SPEAKER_10]: And I hope people know that.

1417
02:14:07,928 --> 02:14:10,149
[SPEAKER_10]: So an invitation is greatly appreciated.

1418
02:14:10,189 --> 02:14:10,550
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1419
02:14:11,550 --> 02:14:11,770
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1420
02:14:12,571 --> 02:14:12,871
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1421
02:14:15,193 --> 02:14:16,473
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you everybody for being here.

1422
02:14:16,493 --> 02:14:18,915
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1423
02:14:25,538 --> 02:14:35,325
[SPEAKER_13]: We have continued business, which I don't believe we have any, and new business offered by member Rousseau.

1424
02:14:35,345 --> 02:14:43,391
[SPEAKER_13]: 2022-28 policy BEDH, policy on public comment and presentations of the public, has a numbering error in section three, presentations of the public.

1425
02:14:43,511 --> 02:14:45,673
[SPEAKER_13]: Therefore, the lettering will be corrected as follows.

1426
02:14:46,433 --> 02:14:53,539
[SPEAKER_13]: Section three, number one, purpose will be renumbered A. Section three, number two, submitting a presentation will be renumbered B.

1427
02:14:54,406 --> 02:15:05,514
[SPEAKER_13]: Section 3D, authority determination will be renumbered C. Section 3E, appealing and authority determination will be numbered D. Meeting date requested, 5-2-2022.

1428
02:15:05,654 --> 02:15:07,816
[SPEAKER_13]: Submitted date, 4-14-2022.

1429
02:15:07,896 --> 02:15:08,536
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Ruseau.

1430
02:15:09,036 --> 02:15:09,597
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mayor.

1431
02:15:09,817 --> 02:15:16,502
[SPEAKER_20]: I'd like to make a motion to suspend rule number 46, requiring two readings of this, since there is in fact no content change.

1432
02:15:16,562 --> 02:15:20,444
[SPEAKER_20]: It is just a correction to the numbering.

1433
02:15:20,805 --> 02:15:21,125
[SPEAKER_13]: Second.

1434
02:15:21,787 --> 02:15:30,452
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion to suspend the rules to not require a second reading to take both readings tonight by member Rousseau, seconded by member McLaughlin.

1435
02:15:30,893 --> 02:15:31,673
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

1436
02:15:32,194 --> 02:15:32,354
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

1437
02:15:32,774 --> 02:15:33,554
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

1438
02:15:34,295 --> 02:15:35,115
[SPEAKER_13]: Paper passes.

1439
02:15:36,096 --> 02:15:41,619
[SPEAKER_13]: And motion for approval by member Rousseau, seconded by member McLaughlin.

1440
02:15:42,060 --> 02:15:42,880
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

1441
02:15:42,900 --> 02:15:43,601
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

1442
02:15:43,801 --> 02:15:44,601
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

1443
02:15:46,462 --> 02:15:47,203
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

1444
02:15:48,058 --> 02:16:01,265
[SPEAKER_13]: Reports requested 2022-27 update on implementation of NWEA map offered by members, member Hays, member McLaughlin and member Stone from March 21st, 2022 meeting.

1445
02:16:03,246 --> 02:16:03,487
[SPEAKER_20]: Mayor.

1446
02:16:03,967 --> 02:16:04,587
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Ruseau.

1447
02:16:04,967 --> 02:16:05,608
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1448
02:16:06,588 --> 02:16:14,072
[SPEAKER_20]: In consultation with the superintendent's office, there's still some clarity we need to

1449
02:16:16,534 --> 02:16:21,958
[SPEAKER_20]: get to on our agenda creation, which, you know, we did make such a huge change that doesn't surprise me.

1450
02:16:23,179 --> 02:16:35,329
[SPEAKER_20]: The way that I had understood report requests is that we would make the report requests, they would be new business, and then they would stay on the agenda under reports requested until satisfied.

1451
02:16:35,449 --> 02:16:36,289
[SPEAKER_20]: So I

1452
02:16:37,370 --> 02:16:39,452
[SPEAKER_20]: believe that was the intent of the committee.

1453
02:16:40,132 --> 02:16:41,373
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's why it's on here.

1454
02:16:41,433 --> 02:16:44,156
[SPEAKER_20]: It is not that there's an actual report to come back today.

1455
02:16:44,176 --> 02:16:47,939
[SPEAKER_20]: I just think it's important for the committee to know that that's why it's here.

1456
02:16:47,959 --> 02:16:50,301
[SPEAKER_20]: Because I noticed in the last meeting, it wasn't.

1457
02:16:50,941 --> 02:16:53,583
[SPEAKER_20]: And I was like, wait, well, where did that report go?

1458
02:16:54,044 --> 02:17:02,691
[SPEAKER_20]: So I just wanted to let the committee know that that was why it's appearing on the agenda tonight, even though it's not something to discuss.

1459
02:17:02,711 --> 02:17:05,193
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, thank you.

1460
02:17:05,851 --> 02:17:08,673
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, that was an approval also, but oh, yeah, sorry.

1461
02:17:08,693 --> 02:17:09,353
[SPEAKER_13]: We're on number 10.

1462
02:17:09,874 --> 02:17:10,134
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1463
02:17:11,075 --> 02:17:14,677
[SPEAKER_13]: Number 11, we do have condolences.

1464
02:17:15,738 --> 02:17:16,158
[SPEAKER_13]: Bear with me.

1465
02:17:16,538 --> 02:17:24,744
[SPEAKER_13]: The Medford School Committee expresses its sincere condolences to the family of Doris Lupe, a fifth grade teacher at the former Forest Park School.

1466
02:17:25,544 --> 02:17:33,590
[SPEAKER_13]: The Medford School Committee expresses its sincere condolences to the family of Anthony Pasquale, a member of the Mustang Hall of Fame and a captain of the 1978 Mustang football team.

1467
02:17:35,694 --> 02:17:38,817
[SPEAKER_13]: the only MHS football team who won a Super Bowl title.

1468
02:17:39,878 --> 02:17:48,866
[SPEAKER_13]: The Medford School Committee expresses its sincere condolences to the family of Michael Francis Falco, husband of Debra Falco, a paraprofessional at the McGlynn Elementary School.

1469
02:17:48,886 --> 02:17:56,893
[SPEAKER_13]: The Medford School Committee expresses its sincere condolences to the family of Kevin Hickey Sr., a longtime vocational teacher and class advisor.

1470
02:17:57,593 --> 02:18:01,697
[SPEAKER_13]: The Medford School Committee expresses its sincere condolences to the family of Stephen J. Day,

1471
02:18:02,247 --> 02:18:04,769
[SPEAKER_13]: who taught history at Medford High School for 35 years.

1472
02:18:04,869 --> 02:18:06,490
[SPEAKER_13]: If we all may rise for a moment of silence.

1473
02:18:22,161 --> 02:18:25,704
[SPEAKER_13]: We are preparing budget hearings for next week.

1474
02:18:25,764 --> 02:18:31,148
[SPEAKER_13]: So we will put out those dates in the next day or two, hoping for two to three budget hearings.

1475
02:18:32,546 --> 02:18:33,207
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, great.

1476
02:18:34,268 --> 02:18:39,374
[SPEAKER_13]: And our next regularly scheduled meeting will be Monday, May 16th, 2022 at 6 p.m.

1477
02:18:39,414 --> 02:18:40,996
[SPEAKER_13]: here in the chambers and also on Zoom.

1478
02:18:41,877 --> 02:18:42,418
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you everybody.
