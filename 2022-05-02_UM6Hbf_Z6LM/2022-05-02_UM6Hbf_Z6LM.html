    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=353.476s">Yes,</a>  seven the affirmative, zero in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=356.22s">Donations</a>  are accepted. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=358.203s">We</a>  have a report of subcommittees, communication, and family engagement subcommittee meeting minutes 4-27-2022. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=368.379s">Member</a>  Graham.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=370.22s">Yeah,</a>  so we met last week on two topics that the committee sent to our committee in the past couple of months. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=377.303s">The</a>  first topic was around all the letters and communications we send as it relates to absenteeism. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=383.425s">So</a>  part of the purpose of the meeting was to understand better what we are required to do versus what we actually do in practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=391.888s">And</a>  then to talk about whether there is a more aligned way to have those communications that is consistent with the district's goals around family engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=403.59s">and</a>  communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=404.53s">So</a>  that was the first topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=406.431s">We</a>  had a good discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=407.951s">A</a>  couple of things that I thought were worth pointing out. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=411.012s">We</a>  are required to send a letter once students miss a certain number of days, I believe it's 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=416.293s">As</a>  a district, we choose to send a letter at 5, 10 and 15. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=421.994s">And</a>  we agreed in the meeting that we would be working on some revised drafts so that those letters could be more consistent with <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=429.776s">The</a>  notion that part of what we're doing, especially at five absences, is trying to make sure the families know that we're here, we care, we wanna work with them, we wanna understand what the challenges are so that their students can get back to learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=443.059s">Same</a>  thing at 10 is really to sort of reinforce that we're still here, we're still invested in making sure the student has what they need to be successful in school. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=451.862s">And</a>  then 15 being sort of that third letter with a similar touch, but obviously an escalating concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=458.243s">So</a>  we talked about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=459.823s">The</a>  administration is going to draft copies of those new letters that we will hopefully be able to get into production, into the flow of communication by next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=472.105s">And</a>  thanks to Megan Fidler-Carey, who's our Director of Family and Community Engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=477.606s">She</a>  attended the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=479.567s">She</a>  talked a lot about how the work that the re-engagement specialists are doing is really aligned with some of this work that we're trying to do around <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=487.408s">family</a>  communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=489.31s">The</a>  other letter that we talked about was what I'll say is the letter that goes out at the beginning of the year, which is traditionally been penned by District Attorney Marion Ryan that talks about the requirement for students to come to school, and it goes into a fair bit of <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=506.128s">legal</a>  conversation around what the law says about how you must send your child to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=512.049s">And</a>  it does cover in some detail via a lot of legalese the consequences of not sending your child to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=518.891s">And</a>  we also agreed at that time that we would look to redraft that letter with some additional outreach to understand what the requirements are around that letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=530.033s">The</a>  reason that we'll do that is because that's the letter that goes out at the beginning of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=534.958s">So</a>  it's, you know, the first letter families should be receiving about attendance from us. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=540.443s">And</a>  we want to make sure that the letter actually reflects what our policies are and that the letter reflects the approach that we try to take to family and community engagement in a proactive manner rather than being focused on text from Mass General Law. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=558.302s">So</a>  that was topic number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=559.906s">Topic</a>  number two, the other thing we did talk about with topic number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=566.775s">Although</a>  I don't see it on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=571.618s">We</a>  did talk about the fact that there are five attendance policies associated with our policy handbook. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=578.982s">I</a>  don't see it officially on the agenda, so I will submit it officially for next week so that you all can vote on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=584.004s">But</a>  the recommendation of the subcommittee that's reflected in the minutes is that the committee will, in addition to drafting those letters, actually go through and review the attendance and truancy policies. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=595.03s">so</a>  that they are consistent and hopefully don't take five to actually get the point across about attendance and truancy. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=603.036s">So</a>  that was topic number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=605.318s">Topic</a>  number two was really covering the topic of the communication strategy, which we asked the administration for about a year and a half ago now. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=617.046s">That</a>  topic, they did share with us a number of updates around a new platform that they have purchased that will streamline communications so in addition to being able to more seamlessly push web content out which I think is <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=632.678s">a</a>  huge and important part of how we improve and up our game on a website perspective, but that the tool also has the capability to streamline communications around social media, texting, potentially to replace school brains. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=645.845s">So</a>  they are evaluating that piece of it to figure out what the implementation timing is. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=651.528s">And</a>  they did say they hope to give us a preview of some of the work on the website going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=656.37s">There</a>  were lots of good questions asked about the platform versus the content. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=662.513s">And</a>  I think one of the things the team felt really good about is that the contract we signed for the software tool does come with support dedicated to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=672.44s">So</a>  we will have some administrative support from the vendor that will make less lighter work of that side of the house for us that will allow us to focus on content. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=684.621s">So</a>  that was sort of a quick summary of the meeting and I will submit the five policies so we can officially vote on that at the next meeting.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=696.592s">Member</a>  McLaughlin, just your microphone, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=699.896s">Welcome</a>  everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=700.516s">There's</a>  some more seats up front if you want to come on in with the little ones.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=711.277s">I'm</a>  trying to remember between the subcommittee meetings, but did that meeting say that we needed to schedule another meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=717.883s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=718.544s">So</a>  did we need to make a motion for that?</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=720.886s">When</a>  we ask you all to send those five policies back to us, I think that'll give us the runway to schedule a subsequent meeting about that topic.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=732.796s">Motion</a>  to approve the minutes?</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=733.777s">Motion</a>  to approve by Member Ruseau, seconded by Member McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=736.658s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=737.639s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=738.059s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=738.959s">Minutes</a>  have passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=740.32s">Next</a>  up we have rules and policy subcommittee meeting minutes from 4-27-2022. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=743.162s">Member</a>  Ruseau?</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=746.018s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=746.798s">We</a>  met for a second time on April 27th, related to two policies that we're working on. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=753.562s">One</a>  was the school attorney policy, which we have renamed the committee attorney policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=760.005s">And</a>  at the next meeting, that policy will be on our agenda for us to review and hopefully approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=767.288s">There's</a>  nothing terribly exciting to say about that policy, other than the members are using our school attorney <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=775.509s">effectively</a>  and respectfully. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=777.171s">So</a>  it was just an update to language that looked outdated. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=781.514s">The</a>  other thing that we're working on is the dress code policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=785.598s">And</a>  at the last meeting on the 27th of April, we unveiled a potential dress code policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=794.666s">I've</a>  received a bunch of feedback from members of the community, all positive. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=800.416s">And</a>  we're going to have one more meeting on this so that the administration and staff have a chance to really <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=807.691s">think</a>  it through and think about what the impact of the new policy or a new policy will be. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=813.553s">It's</a>  not something you can just read once and imagine how it works in the day to day. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=818.395s">So</a>  we will be meeting again in May. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=821.456s">I</a>  don't have the date yet, but we're meeting again in May, hopefully to finalize this policy and send it to the full committee in the first meeting of June so we can have it ready and going for implementation in the fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=835.441s">And</a>  that's about it.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=838.652s">Motion</a>  to approve? <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=840.535s">Motion</a>  for approval by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=844.8s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=845.862s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=846.282s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=847.944s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=850.067s">Number</a>  six, report of the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=852.41s">We</a>  have superintendent's updates and comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=854.693s">Dr.</a>  Reese, Edouard-Vincent, our superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=861.837s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=862.898s">I</a>  would like to extend our thanks to Tufts University, who presented community grants to both our CCSR and Medford family network. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=872.509s">Each</a>  group received $2,000 for special projects so a special thank you <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=879.036s">to</a>  Tufts University and the Medford Family Network intends to use its funding for new programs for children with autism, including adaptive swim, soccer lessons, and nature hikes. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=892.149s">And</a>  our CCSR students would like to do continued cleanup of our Fells reservation. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=900.709s">Also</a>  this weekend, we had a significant amount of volunteers come to throughout the city, but also to the Medford High School campus. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=910.733s">They</a>  did an outstanding job cleaning up a lot of trash and miscellaneous things that were left on our property. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=917.915s">And</a>  I just want to thank all of those who sent pictures and let us see the before and after shots of the work that they did this weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=927.403s">Tonight,</a>  our Muslim families and friends are celebrating the end of Ramadan with Eid al-Fitr or breaking of the fast. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=936.473s">Fasting</a>  in the month of Ramadan is considered one of the five pillars of Islam. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=941.758s">Muslims</a>  believe that the past year sins are forgiven, good deeds are multiplied, and prayers are answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=949.526s">Eid</a>  Mubarak, which means may God flood your lives with happiness, your heart with love, your soul with spirituality, your mind with wisdom. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=958.832s">Happy</a>  Eid to those of our community who are of Muslim faith. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=964.838s">Also</a>  this week is Teacher Appreciation Week, and the theme this year, yes, yes, I did say that, is teaching is a work of heart. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=976.308s">The</a>  administrators and families of Medford appreciate the dedication of our teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=982.174s">I</a>  hope the teachers and staff enjoy the many treats the PTOs have organized for them this upcoming week. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=989.6s">and</a>  the President of the Medford Teachers Union will be speaking this evening, and I appreciate the hard work our teachers and staff are doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=999.743s">Also,</a>  next week is Nurses Appreciation Week. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1004.704s">A</a>  million thanks to the nurses, our nursing staff, who have provided so much support over the course of the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1013.928s">They</a>  have continued to work very hard with vaccination clinics and helping to maintain our healthy, safe community. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1022.592s">So</a>  thank you in advance to our nurses as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1026.253s">I</a>  want to, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1035.481s">Also,</a>  I want to extend special thanks to all of our administrative professionals and our principals who have had their days of appreciation last week and on yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1047.673s">So</a>  thank you to all of them serving our community as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1052.301s">This</a>  weekend, some very good news to share. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1055.362s">Our</a>  robotics students, with guidance from teacher Sam Christie, participated in the New England Robotics Championship and won. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1065.607s">They</a>  are now eligible to compete in the National Championship in Long Beach, California later this month. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1073.43s">It's</a>  simply fabulous news, and we're very proud of our engineering and robotics students. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1080.832s">also</a>  this weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1082.582s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1089.617s">Also</a>  this weekend, the Medford High School Orchestra and our marching band competed in the Music in the Parks competition. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1098.063s">The</a>  orchestra came in first with an overall rating of excellent, and the marching band came in first with an overall rating of superior. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1108.351s">This</a>  is a great accomplishment. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1110.352s">Congratulations</a>  to our musical Mustangs. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1122.498s">Lastly,</a>  we extend our congratulations to senior Connor Finnegan, who scored 10 goals as a member of the boys lacrosse team. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1133.083s">This</a>  is the most goals ever scored by one lacrosse player in Mustang history. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1139.846s">As</a>  the Mustangs beat Malden 19 to zero. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1144.088s">The</a>  Mustangs are now nine and two and just became the GBL champs. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1149.351s">Congratulations</a>  boys lacrosse team. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1158.135s">Also,</a>  I am happy to share that our community is bustling and hosting more and more in-person events, including concerts, plays, and award ceremonies over the course of the next few weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1172.048s">In</a>  particular, during the week of May 9th to the 13th, we will be hosting open houses for kindergartners and middle schoolers. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1181.636s">So</a>  on Tuesday, May 10th, McGlynn Middle School open house for rising sixth graders from six to 8 p.m. <a

to see you there for our rising sixth graders. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1201.41s">Our</a>  kindergarten students, Wednesday, May 11th at 2 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1206.573s">will</a>  be the kindergarten open houses. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1209.901s">Lastly,</a>  I would like to remind everyone that this Sunday, May 8th, is Mother's Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1215.748s">I'd</a>  like to wish all the mothers and grandmothers and caregivers in the MPS community a very happy Mother's Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1223.057s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1275.909s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1276.669s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1277.19s">I</a>  know you can't hear out there, so I feel, I wanna make sure everybody can hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1280.67s">Number</a>  two, we have report on unified sports and adaptive physical education. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1284.551s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1284.771s">Joan</a>  Bowen, director of pupil services, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1287.372s">Rachel</a>  Perry, director of physical education and health education, and Carla Andre, adaptive physical education teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1295.894s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1299.104s">Good</a>  evening, Mayor and members of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1301.707s">Tonight,</a>  I'm joined by Rachel Perry and Carla Andre to present an update regarding two programs that were implemented during this school year, adaptive physical education and unified sports. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1313.333s">We</a>  would like to thank the school committee and once again, express our appreciation to the committee for prioritizing and supporting both these initiatives, which have greatly contributed to meaningful inclusionary experiences for our most vulnerable population. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1328.821s">So</a>  thank you again.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1333.365s">Looks</a>  like I really drew a crowd tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1337.188s">This</a>  is going to be the best part of your night, I promise. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1341.151s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[U1EIl_L-LWc_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1364.707s">Dr.</a>  Cushy. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1366.389s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1370.072s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1371.033s">So</a>  tonight I'm here to talk to you about adapted physical education, a program that we rolled out this year, as well as unified sports in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1378.421s">I'm</a>  going to start with the adapted physical education piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1380.923s">So</a>  this is an end of the year update. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1384.96s">So</a>  just the hard data and numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1387.182s">Initially,</a>  when I first met with you and presented this in front of all of you at the beginning of the year, we had about 70 to 80 referrals, which is a huge number. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1395.43s">So</a>  between physical education teachers, special education teachers, we felt, you know, these are all the recommendations, these are the numbers that were given to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1405.24s">After</a>  I went in, <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1406.981s">And</a>  I got to look at the population and determine eligibility, the numbers, more around 40 right now that's, you know, it will only grow from here but currently this year we're at about 40 students who require adapted physical education to access the physical education curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1425.018s">The</a>  other two numbers are, we have, the numbers are actually updated as of today, even as IEPs are signed and they come in, that number goes up. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1433.742s">So</a>  what that means is I'm waiting for 28 IEPs to be signed and come back to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1439.685s">And</a>  we already have 12 that are established and students are being serviced. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1446.46s">And</a>  then just to refresh about the process, not every student requires adaptive physical education, not every student gets it because we think they might benefit from it. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1455.483s">There</a>  is a process to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1457.503s">So</a>  first I determined qualification, meaning does the student already have an established disability? <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1463.565s">Is</a>  the student already on an IEP? <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1465.666s">Once</a>  I observed the student, we sent out a parent consent working with the ETLs. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1470.927s">And</a>  then I went in and did a formal or an informal assessment. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1474.608s">I</a>  met with the parent to review the assessment, and then I added the service to the IEP. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1479.252s">And</a>  then just to note that all purchases were made within the physical education budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1486.258s">Next</a>  slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1488.58s">This</a>  is the formal assessment that Rachel and I talked about, and we decided this would be best for our population to use. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1494.625s">So</a>  it is the Adapted Physical Education Assessment Scale, and it is elementary and secondary specific. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1503.334s">Next</a>  slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1504.215s">And</a>  this is just an example. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1505.456s">There</a>  are two parts to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1506.637s">The</a>  first part being, you know, very physical, so motor, object control, locomotor skills, physical fitness. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1513.823s">But</a>  then there's a second part that's really important, and you can go to the next slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1518.246s">This</a>  is more about the cognitive ability, participation, if there's any medical restrictions or behavior restrictions that prevent a student from participating in gen ed physical education. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1531.331s">Next</a>  slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1533.773s">So</a>  how I ran the program is that I did units and I lined it up with the curriculum and the standards that were given to me by the physical education department. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1542.138s">So</a>  for example, if third grade in the month of November, they were working on baseball skills, throwing, hitting an object with a bat. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1552.464s">We</a>  did that in adaptive physical education, small group classes as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1556.707s">And</a>  that's to bridge the gap and to eventually get these students into inclusion, you know, if that if that is an opportunity for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1566.015s">You</a>  can go to the next slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1570.579s">And</a>  these are just some examples. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1571.84s">So</a>  this is just a visual board that I would use with my students. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1575.515s">and</a>  you would see standards and the objective, the activity, PE and gym rules, you'll see that hanging in any gym across the district that you walk into. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1585.421s">Because</a>  I travel, my board travels with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1590.184s">And</a>  the next couple of slides, you can go through them. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1592.946s">Students'</a>  faces are blocked out for privacy, but these are just some examples. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1597.089s">You</a>  see we have soccer, hockey, baseball, covered every sport that the other schools were doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1608.45s">And</a>  you can go to the next slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1610.592s">And</a>  we are going to switch gears to Medford unified sports. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1615.017s">So</a>  this, this is separate. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1616.358s">This</a>  is an extracurricular activity. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1620.265s">We</a>  rolled out three sports this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1622.505s">So</a>  we started with unified basketball at the high school level, which was a huge success. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1626.726s">And</a>  I want to thank many of you that came out, um, you know, the faculty as well, we had so much support and the students really felt that, and it was just a beautiful thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1635.068s">And,</a>  um, I felt that it was really successful for our very first season of it ever. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1639.729s">Um,</a>  this is not unified is something that Massachusetts has been doing for several years. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1645.89s">It</a>  was just our first year participating in it, um, at the high school level. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1651.53s">You</a>  can go to the next slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1654.673s">So</a>  here are the numbers we were at capacity for our basketball, we had a huge interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1660.278s">16</a>  is kind of a lot for a basketball team. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1662.38s">So</a>  in the years to come, if we have double the interest, we're going to make two teams. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1667.244s">So</a>  for high school basketball, we played other districts in our area. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1672.629s">Then</a>  we did middle school basketball. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1674.69s">It</a>  was supposed to be kind of the same idea where we would play other middle schools in our area. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1680.433s">Other</a>  districts didn't feel that they were ready for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1683.415s">We</a>  felt that we were, so we put it out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1686.737s">Unfortunately,</a>  we weren't able to play other schools because we didn't have the participation from surrounding cities, so we had a clinic. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1693.341s">We</a>  hit capacity on that huge interest, and we're hoping that next year we'll be able to travel and play other cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1700.819s">And</a>  then lastly we did high school track and field that is actually ongoing right now we have about 15 participants in that as well, which is, which is a good number. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1711.181s">So</a>  Special Olympics provides a stipend. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1714.083s">They</a>  make the schedule and they choose the sports that are currently being offered. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1717.744s">So</a>  we've gotten a lot of feedback on recommendations for different sports and could we try unified volleyball or hockey or things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1726.489s">Special</a>  Olympics does fund that and they do provide the sport. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1729.03s">So</a>  as of right now, it is only basketball, track and field, and I think bocce that, yeah, we're not in that quite yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1737.785s">And</a>  these are just some highlights some pictures. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1741.289s">You</a>  can skip down to the last slide and I think just the best way to wrap it up is to play this highlight video it's a two minute long video and that will wrap up our presentation.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1891.48s">Thank</a>  you for the presentation member McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1893.921s">Yes,</a>  thank you for the presentation and it was just a beautiful thing really does sum it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1897.903s">This</a>  is a great two programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1900.364s">Thank</a>  you so much for Carla and Rachel. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1902.825s">I</a>  know that this has been a dream of yours for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1904.846s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1905.444s">It's</a>  so nice to see it actually come to fruition. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1907.746s">And</a>  I think it's such a good thing for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1910.528s">And</a>  I did have just a couple of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1913.953s">Were</a>  there any students that, I know you said that you were at capacity for, I think, the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1919.075s">So</a>  were there any students, this is for the unified, were there any students that you had to turn away or?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1924.458s">So</a>  for the high school team, we took all 16 that were interested. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1927.539s">That's</a>  a big number for a basketball team. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1929.84s">So</a>  I wanted everyone to be able to participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1932.481s">I</a>  think in the future, we'll think about having two teams. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1936.023s">And</a>  then for the middle school clinic, the capacity was 30, just because we did, you know, the gym is only so big. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1943.726s">And</a>  I did have a wait list for that.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1946.328s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1948.029s">Um,</a>  because of the gym, just because of the space, more than 30 kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1952.291s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1952.831s">It</a>  just wouldn't have, um, yeah, it wouldn't have worked as well.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1956.334s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1956.874s">And</a>  I was able to come to some of those and they were beautiful. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1959.215s">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1959.956s">And</a>  also the football team I saw at some of the games and I think what was really remarkable to see the unique and natural friendships that were evolving during the team and people feeling like they really belonged. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1969.982s">And</a>  that was something really special to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1973.196s">And</a>  then I also just wanted to ask about other staff that were involved, because I know that there were a lot of other staff there, and I just want to make sure that we recognize them.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1978.577s">There</a>  were other staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1979.557s">John</a>  Skerry helped me out quite a bit on really all aspects, basketball, and he's helping me with track and field right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1985.919s">Nicole</a>  Sylvester, who's a special education teacher, she was my assistant as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1990.06s">Michael</a>  McLaughlin came out to a lot and showed his support, and he really helped me out. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1994.321s">I'm</a>  trying to think if I missed, David Richard was a coach for our middle school basketball clinic. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=1999.802s">Am</a>  I missing anybody? <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2001.769s">Denise</a>  Desjardins was helping, out of the goodness of her own heart, she was volunteering. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2005.614s">So</a>  we did have a couple of volunteers as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2007.797s">So</a>  we're really thankful for that.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2009.339s">Cindy</a>  Griffin came and volunteered.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2010.761s">Yep,</a>  as well as Cindy. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2012.463s">But</a>  it, you know, it takes volunteers as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2015.367s">So</a>  if anybody's ever interested, it's a really beautiful thing to be a part of.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2018.732s">You</a>  know, the high school volunteers. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2020.894s">Yes,</a>  student had a yeah, that's right.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2022.495s">A</a>  high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2024.177s">So,</a>  you know, with unified, we want to make sure that it's really authentic friendship. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2028.4s">So</a>  we don't want high school volunteering for the high school level. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2031.523s">So</a>  they volunteered for the middle school level, because that's, you know, that's the students are older. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2036.147s">So</a>  the volunteers would definitely be different ages.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2039.437s">it's</a>  been really thoughtful in terms of the way that you've put it together. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2041.858s">So</a>  I, I, as a parent of a child with an intellectual and developmental disability, especially appreciate and can see the uniqueness of the way that you put it together. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2049.081s">So</a>  thank you very, very much for that and for being so inclusive. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2052.902s">And</a>  there was one other thing that I did have to ask was, oh, and I also think you're setting a trend in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2057.844s">So,</a>  you know, the there's a theater program now that's an adaptive theater program. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2062.706s">And</a>  I think it's part of the trend that you guys are setting. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2064.907s">So</a>  I just wanted to say, thank you for that.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2068.568s">Awesome.</a> </p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2069.878s">Member</a>  Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2071.698s">Thank</a>  you for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2072.499s">I</a>  agree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2073.079s">This</a>  is probably going to be the most fun we have tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2075.84s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2078.52s">I</a>  recall that in last year's budget, we added staff to support the adaptive PE. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2087.383s">Is</a>  that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2089.203s">Was</a>  it half an FTE or a full FTE? <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2092.624s">I'm</a>  just trying to remember.</p>

    <p>[Perry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2094.745s">Yes,</a>  that was one of <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2097.108s">FTE</a>  and that was Carla's position. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2098.709s">Okay,</a>  so she's won full time.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2100.309s">And</a>  based on this first year and all the IEPs that you're moving through, and I know you said you anticipate the program to grow, do you <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2110.632s">do</a>  you anticipate that you will need the school committee to respond with additional staff at this year, next year, sometime soon, or we think we're in like a level space?</p>

    <p>[Perry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2122.238s">I</a>  don't think we'll need any within the next couple of years going forward possibly, but as of right now, I think we're good. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2127.761s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2129.122s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2129.382s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2129.802s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2133.607s">Member</a>  McLaughlin and Dr. Benson.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2135.088s">Yeah,</a>  I just had one other question, because thank you to the chair, member Graham, about the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2139.451s">I</a>  also wanted to ask about, I know that you said that the purchases for AP were in the PE budget, and I was wondering if that was, did that take up a lot of cost, or is there anything that we need to know about additional cost for things that you folks might need? <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2153.781s">And</a>  I also just want to say simple things just make a huge difference, too, that I noticed in the picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2158.765s">So</a>  thank you for the Velcro, and just some simple things that can be done, some low-tech things.</p>

    <p>[Perry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2163.887s">Is</a>  there additional need? <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2166.709s">Right</a>  now, we're not gonna ask for anything more in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2169.071s">I</a>  think we've purchased what we need for this year and Carl has done a phenomenal job of using some of the equipment we already have and adapting that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2175.795s">So</a>  at this point, we don't need anything else.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2179.679s">Miss</a>  Andre, were you saying something about some of the adaptive equipment too, perhaps through other programming or?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2185.424s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2186.665s">So</a>  I obviously have a lot of ideas that I'm not going to put out right now, but ultimately, hopefully we can use our own resources, maybe in the vocational school that we have to just, you know, make low tech equipment for, and that would kind of be a natural way of, you know, education and awareness, disability awareness kind of built right in. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2206.501s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2207.242s">That's</a>  just something for the future and where I want to go with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2210.764s">Great.</a> </p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2211.605s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2212.205s">You</a>  have a lot of great ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2213.506s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2214.226s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Edwardson.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2215.867s">I</a>  just wanted to say thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2217.748s">I</a>  had the opportunity to definitely go and participate and observe the basketball games, and it was absolutely wonderful seeing students working together, playing together, cheering on each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2233.277s">Even</a>  the parents, I want to thank all the parents who were so actively involved because we cheered for all the students, no matter what side scored. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2240.801s">And</a>  so it was definitely a different way to think about sports. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2245.663s">And</a>  I think it brought so many students, families in our community together in a different way. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2251.466s">So</a>  just thank you for <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2252.947s">taking</a>  that extra challenge on and the unified sports were, it was absolutely fabulous. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2259.592s">And</a>  the video and the pictures from what's been happening in Adaptive PE was also excellent. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2265.296s">So</a>  thank you for that.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2267.978s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2268.539s">Question.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2269.579s">One</a>  question. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2270.7s">Miss</a>  Andre. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2271.561s">Miss</a>  Andre. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2273.022s">Miss</a>  Andre. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2273.923s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2276.381s">Just</a>  Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2276.882s">Andre,</a>  when should we expect the final, like the big race for track and field, or do you already have it? <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2286.949s">Oh,</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2288.85s">Okay,</a>  good luck. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2295.034s">Number</a>  three, we have recommendation to approve Medford as a no school choice district. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2298.817s">Dr.</a>  Marice Edouard-Vincent, superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2302.493s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2304.815s">Every</a>  year we have to report to Desi and take an official vote and so I'm coming before you, your body this evening again, asking that Medford continue to maintain their status as a no school choice district. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2322.134s">And</a>  I'm asking for your support with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2326.996s">Medford</a>  has a lot of diversity of population and students here. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2334.539s">And</a>  I feel that we truly are doing the best we can do to service our current community. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2340.602s">And</a>  so my recommendation would be that we remain a no school choice district.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2349.105s">May</a>  I? <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2349.885s">Member</a>  McLaughlin and Member Ruseau.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2351.724s">Would</a>  you mind if we just have a brief explanation of what that is? <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2355.233s">So</a>  for folks who are watching that don't know what that means, maybe just two lines or something.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2361.845s">When</a>  you're a school choice district, you receive other, you're able to receive students from other communities and other districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2372.969s">And</a>  there are a lot of some districts that are school choice districts, but I think with the complexities that we have here in Medford, our current population. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2385.734s">We</a>  have, I feel that we definitely have our hands for servicing the population that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2393.476s">And</a>  when you're a school choice district. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2397.657s">You're</a>  not able to pick some students and not pick others. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2402.298s">So</a>  once you have that status. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2406.055s">people</a>  are welcome to apply, and you don't always know what may happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2414.098s">And</a>  I think just for where we are as a district, it is not in our best interests to become a school choice district at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2421.72s">Every</a>  year I have to bring it before your body, but I would kindly request that you support the fact that we're a no school choice district.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2455.691s">Yes,</a>  70 affirmative, zero in the negative, paper passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2458.933s">Number</a>  four, report on McGlynn playground inspections. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2461.475s">Dr.</a>  Peter Cushing, assistant superintendent of secondary education.</p>

    <p>[U1EIl_L-LWc_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2466.072s">Dr.</a>  Cushing.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2473.974s">Good</a>  evening, Madam Mayor, School Committee, our esteemed faculty and staff, and members of the public gathered here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2480.737s">I'm</a>  going to take this time to address two motions on the October 4th <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2485.922s">school</a>  committee agenda that were made. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2487.863s">The</a>  first was offered by member Rousseau, whereas the McLean playground continues to be in a substandard condition and the standing water has been an issue there and concern around mosquito-borne illnesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2502.087s">An</a>  update was requested on the project and a request will be made to the mayor, to the DPW to clear standing water at the playground whenever standing water is present. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2511.449s">Over</a>  the past several months, the DPW has cleared the water at least twice that I know of, and they have actually worked, the new head of the DPW has worked to establish a plan to replace and retrofit the failing French drain. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2530.876s">The</a>  French drain system surrounds the backside of the playground and drains water away to various culverts in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2538.789s">The</a>  French drain is a plastic corrugated pipe, as best we can tell, and numerous of the junction boxes have also failed. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2546.485s">About</a>  50% of the pipe failed, and the area has been marked by Dig Safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2554.151s">And</a>  the last thing that we were waiting for, the DPW was actually hoping to conclude the project over April vacation, but the report that I have said that the gas company did not respond to the request to mark the area, so shovels could not go in the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2573.305s">So</a>  we're currently on hold waiting for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2576.147s">The</a>  DPW has been responsive when standing water is there to pump it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2582.535s">And</a>  that standing water is, we'll get to it in the report, but that standing water is actually a area of concern beyond mosquito borne illnesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2592.045s">but</a>  for the overall viability of the playground itself and its long-term, you know, when we shift to a new playground, its long-term goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2602.533s">We</a>  have gone through a process. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2605.376s">There</a>  are several people who have been on a steering committee with me to work on selecting one of the city's pre-approved vendors. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2614.736s">There</a>  are three pre-approved vendors. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2616.497s">Two</a>  of the vendors chose to submit financial requests, RFPs, for this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2624.804s">The</a>  successful candidate was Copley-Wolf Design Group. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2628.767s">They</a>  were selected because of their extreme willingness to get this right as a universally accessible playground. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2638.474s">That's</a>  where I'd like to really start. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2639.675s">This</a>  connects in with what Carla was talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2643.239s">A</a>  universally accessible playground is going to provide play structures and play opportunities for all of our students at the McGlynn Playground that are at their cognitive, physical, and any other ability level possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2658.854s">Now,</a>  why is this important? <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2660.796s">Well,</a>  right now, <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2663.019s">The</a>  playground has none of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2665.82s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2667.36s">And</a>  as a matter of fact, it looks as our CPSI certified playground safety inspector said, it looks great from afar, but it really has no fun to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2681.104s">Kids</a>  will run, kids will jump, but as far as engaging games, engaging activities, <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2688.158s">and</a>  other opportunities for play supported by a structure, it doesn't really exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2693.905s">The</a>  playground is the city's largest playground for schools at about 25,000 square feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2700.551s">It</a>  has two play structures. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2702.773s">Both,</a>  it appears, because there's no signage, both, it appears, are for grades ages five to 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2710.48s">Playgrounds</a>  are rated by their grade level. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2713.463s">The</a>  lower playground is used by our pre-K population that is at the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2719.233s">The</a>  playground has numerous issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2723.355s">So</a>  before I get into those issues with that report, which is the second request, the design study is moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2732.179s">We</a>  have 12 members of a 14-member board identified. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2737.961s">we</a>  delayed a little bit because we wanted to make sure that the final two spots were truly representative of all Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2747.867s">And</a>  so we've delayed to be able to make sure that we did some further outreach to make sure that we were really addressing our goals to make sure that this is a universally accessible playground and that we had the appropriate voice there. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2762.475s">Now,</a>  those 14 people will not represent the only public input. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2766.657s">We</a>  will have a tremendous amount of public input on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2769.838s">We</a>  will offer multiple opportunities for students to be involved as well so that they can help design the play structures. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2777.78s">And</a>  what is interesting to note is another playground expert that we've had on this project with us has teamed this not just a school playground, but this is a regional destination playground. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2791.466s">It</a>  services the towers, it services many housing options around there. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2796.59s">In</a>  the summertime when I drive by, it is frequently filled with students more so than any of the other playgrounds that I see at our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2806.437s">Um,</a>  so this playground does offer a tremendous amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2809.499s">We've</a>  also met with members of the city administration to identify further funding to carry out this because this is a $150,000 design study, $40,000 of which has been identified <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2822.705s">through</a>  cpc grants but this will get us through drawings and specs so that the city has a full understanding of the commitments moving forward to really have a truly well-designed universally accessible playground <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2838.387s">in</a>  place. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2839.428s">And</a>  to my knowledge, there's only one other in the area and it just opened. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2843.09s">It's</a>  Dana Hay in Cambridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2845.992s">So</a>  if anybody wants to go and look, it's a great opportunity for you to go and see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2852.596s">Another</a>  one that we were looking at was up in Burlington, Vermont, and then did some other web research across the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2859.721s">So</a>  that's where that is right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2862.402s">I'll</a>  be happy to take questions on that at the end. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2865.363s">The</a>  second was offered by Jenny Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2867.205s">The</a>  second motion was offered by Jenny Graham and it was authorizing up to $2,000 for a playground safety inspection by a certified playground safety inspector at the McGlynn elementary playground as quickly as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2882.482s">We</a>  have completed this. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2883.962s">It</a>  was not done as quickly as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2885.582s">The</a>  playground inspector that we contracted with had a variety of unfortunate incidents. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2892.804s">And</a>  by the time to get someone else in, the person was able to rectify those situations. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2899.206s">And</a>  we were able to have the playground inspected in early March. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2904.567s">That</a>  cost was $900. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2905.487s">And</a>  she is from the, sorry, just trying to read here, <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2915.984s">Playground</a>  Inspections of New England, which is out of Brewster, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2920.41s">So</a>  she went through, she took photographs. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2922.511s">They're</a>  all in your packets. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2923.712s">I'll</a>  put some of the photographs up on screen for it to be part of the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2929.356s">One</a>  of the things that she noted on the first page was that given the deterioration or the perceived deterioration of the soft surface, which is known as poured in place, that's a 25,000 square foot that two years ago was priced out at over half a million dollars to replace, and which is really what triggered all of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2950.182s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2951.884s">The</a>  playground really should be inspected annually. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2954.546s">All</a>  playgrounds should be inspected annually. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2956.287s">So</a>  that's going to be an annual cost that we will now incur. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2960.17s">She</a>  recommended what's known as a head drop test. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2963.332s">We</a>  were very fortunate to be able to quickly turn that around. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2965.974s">The</a>  head drop test itself was $2,100. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2967.755s">And</a>  they did multiple tests from 27 locations around the playground where they used a hemispheric object that had pressure sensors in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2979.643s">So</a>  when they dropped it, they would be able to tell <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2982.004s">the</a>  impact ratings and those types of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2986.228s">At</a>  all heights, at all heights tested, the playground passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2990.571s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=2991.592s">And</a>  I would also like to note in my report that there have been certain times throughout this process that various members of the community have stated that the playground is causing injuries. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3004.283s">Conversations</a>  with the school nurses and then our director of nursing and health services, Avery Hines, we do not find that to be true. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3014.549s">Of</a>  all the injuries caused at the McGlynn, only 1.82% are caused as a result of the playground activity, not the playground itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3026.075s">And</a>  so 52 students reported a fall or injury with the play structure and 26 injuries may have been determined to be because a kid ran into one of the support structures itself, running into a pole. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3040.161s">Only</a>  two of these injuries needed to have a student dismissed and all of these, the nurses feel <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3049.568s">is</a>  100% attributed to normal childhood development and normal childhood play, which as any of the elementary teachers behind me can attest to, the childhood play is a critical part of a student's learning opportunities. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3064.591s">And</a>  so this playground becoming a universally accessible playground over the next several years is going to be critical to making sure that that play opportunity is extended to all of our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3074.434s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3076.874s">I</a>  want to turn now to the report itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3080.14s">And</a>  there were five specific areas that were identified. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3083.827s">First,</a>  the decks, stairs, and bridges. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3087.513s">Then</a>  the surfacing itself, that's the poured-in-place surfacing, the drainage, which I've already addressed, the concrete curve structures, which are meant to mimic the path of the Mystic River, and then the edging itself, which is concrete and should probably be bermed down in the interim. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3108.142s">So</a>  there are various elements of giving priority hazard levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3114.364s">There</a>  were only two areas that were of a high hazard concern that the school is working to mitigate and address those. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3125.648s">We</a>  will be sealing up a hole in the concrete structure that is higher than it should be that on one day of observing, <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3133.51s">We</a>  did see students attempting to climb through. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3136.851s">There</a>  should be a six foot fall area around all structures. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3141.051s">And</a>  this one area does not have six feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3144.072s">It's</a>  only three feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3145.272s">So</a>  we will be sealing up that hole for students to play in. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3150.673s">And</a>  so that'll be done in the near future. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3154.434s">So</a>  let me just switch to the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3159.274s">One</a>  second.</p>

    <p>[U1EIl_L-LWc_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3160.575s">So</a>  you can see the images.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3172.518s">So</a>  these were done in early March when snow was still on the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3176.102s">You</a>  can see over here where the cursor is a large amount of standing water. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3182.129s">And</a>  then if you scroll down, you can see that the walkway itself is submerged in places. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3189.787s">All</a>  right, this is also, this was really good information. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3192.669s">The</a>  teachers noted, you can see here that this playground does not get plowed or cleared of snow. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3199.013s">So</a>  in our redesign, we will be taking that information in. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3202.275s">We</a>  also have, just so everyone's aware, of the 12 people selected, there are a number of teachers, OTs and PTs as well, that are going to be asked to be a part of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3211.722s">And</a>  then you have here just this right here where the cursor is shows the deterioration of the port in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3220.027s">Alright,</a>  patching of the port in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3224.611s">Again,</a>  more snow deterioration of the port in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3227.993s">Here</a>  you have the decking, our playground inspector Nancy Wright, Nancy White stated that, you know, there's so many ramps, and there's so many bridges. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3238.254s">These</a>  are by far the most expensive elements in all playgrounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3242.815s">And</a>  not only are they the most expensive in normal times, but she has seen the prices on these elements skyrocket astronomically. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3250.397s">So</a>  if we were to say, we're just going to replace what's there with new, the cost would be exorbitant for something that, as the playground inspector and others have noticed, just isn't that much fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3261.412s">for</a>  our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3263.374s">So</a>  you've got the bridge here. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3266.877s">You've</a>  got various elements here as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3271.382s">This</a>  is the area that I was speaking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3272.883s">The</a>  use zone needed is six feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3275.446s">So</a>  the window that's on top of here will be closed off. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3282.133s">and</a>  then just various underside weeping of various elements for rust and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3289.675s">A</a>  slide, there's a spiral slide that can't be used when the flooding is there because it's under several inches of water. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3298.677s">And</a>  so various elements here that you can see. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3303.638s">The</a>  head drop inspector actually did a drop from the tree as well so that <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3310.871s">that</a>  we have that information as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3314.294s">So</a>  just various other pieces. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3316.336s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Cushing. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3320.219s">Just</a>  want to address just a couple of quick points, if I may. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3325.444s">So</a>  in the report itself, the playground inspector was very diplomatic, but basically said that the playground is soon to be at the end of its useful life. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3338.25s">The</a>  brand name associated with this, I won't use it, but it does last, but it needs to be well maintained. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3347.658s">And</a>  over the years, you need to maintain it, you need to own it, and there are various moving parts that need to be well cared for. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3355.137s">And</a>  unfortunately, when cities and municipalities have these types of things, a lot of times the maintenance is what doesn't make it through. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3365.023s">The</a>  playgrounds are extraordinarily similar, but don't offer a variety of play for our students, as I've mentioned previously. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3374.786s">And</a>  so those are really the critical aspects of this playground. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3379.389s">The</a>  inspection where we are, we should be notifying members of the committee later this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3383.752s">We</a>  just have to select the final two after a great deal of outreach has been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3389.376s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3390.597s">I</a>  apologize for taking- No, I'm just kidding. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3393.079s">That's</a>  fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3393.479s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Hsing, and thank you for all the hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3396.161s">I</a>  know you're putting together a team. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3397.602s">So</a>  thank you in advance to the 14 member board that will help with this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3403.546s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3404.591s">Okay,</a>  we have number five, Labor Relations Update, Mr. David Murphy, Assistant Superintendent of Finance and Operations.</p>

    <p>[Gordon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3423.522s">Thank</a>  you, Mayor, members of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3425.223s">It's</a>  a pleasure to be with you this evening, with everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3431.417s">I'm</a>  just gonna give Dr. Cushing a moment to put the slides up on the screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3435.822s">The</a>  presentation that you'll see momentarily.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3441.84s">Member</a>  Ruseau? <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3442.821s">If</a>  the audience can't be heard, I'm not sure we can continue this.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3446.584s">No,</a>  it's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3448.626s">Signs</a>  are fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3449.567s">If</a>  you could just let Mr. Murphy, so that we can hear him, that would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3453.43s">And</a>  then I know we have the union rep who's next on the agenda, so we can all be civil. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3458.014s">I'm</a>  sure that will be the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3459.515s">Thank</a>  you, Member Ruseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3461.037s">Mr.</a>  Murphy? <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3461.838s">Thank</a>  you, Mayor.</p>

    <p>[Gordon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3463.284s">So</a>  tonight's update, as you know, we're updating you on a regular basis at this point in the fiscal year on our upcoming FY23 operating budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3475.327s">Tonight's</a>  update relates to a significant component of that operating budget and frankly, every school department's operating budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3484.629s">And</a>  that is the state of our labor relations and specifically our collective bargaining negotiations. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3490.63s">which</a>  as the committee knows, we are engaged in and have been over the course of this school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3496.116s">So</a>  Dr. Cushing, we don't need to do the zooming in until the upcoming slides. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3501.201s">So</a>  if we go to the next one, just with respect to the <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3503.533s">the</a>  bargaining partners themselves, and that's for the community's benefit, the school district has 10 collective bargaining partners, 10 bargaining units, unions that we work with on a regular basis that represents the vast majority of our employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3517.536s">And</a>  obviously, at this point in the negotiations, as evident by our guests this evening, it's normal that in the course of collective bargaining negotiations, that there are gonna be points of disagreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3532.486s">And</a>  so I did want to start by saying, and for those that think it's just rhetoric and would like to dismiss it, that's certainly their right. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3540.191s">But</a>  I think I have a responsibility on behalf of the administration and of the school committee to make very clear that the 10 bargaining units in front of you represent hundreds of extremely hardworking, dedicated public servants that the Medfordist community <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3556.901s">benefits</a>  from on a daily basis and that's been certainly true in a pronounced way over the course of the past two years, as the individuals represented by the union leadership that's here with us this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3572.038s">has</a>  in many ways carried this community, and most importantly, the children and young adults of this community on their back. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3579.624s">And</a>  so regardless of what other finer details we may disagree with from time to time, I think it's important that we start from that premise, that they are the ones that do the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3593.055s">We</a>  are the ones that are on local cable on a regular basis talking about the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3597.358s">That</a>  is our responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3598.538s">I</a>  think it's an important responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3600.119s">It's</a>  important that the community understand the district's vision priorities and how that is translating into the expenditure of their taxpayer dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3608.74s">But</a>  there's no question that the people who are actually doing the work, serving children and putting those children in a better position to live lives that are meaningful and fulfilling are the people that are with us this evening and the people that they represent. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3624.611s">So</a>  these are the 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3626.613s">As</a>  you can see, I've given the status of each of the negotiations of the 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3630.537s">There</a>  is one collective bargaining agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3632.178s">Our</a>  cafeteria workers, that contract is not yet open. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3635.461s">And</a>  so we have not yet begun that process with that unit. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3640.065s">With</a>  the others, the majority, we are in ongoing negotiations. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3643.488s">There's</a>  one bargaining that we've scheduled a first session with, but have not gotten to the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3649.874s">And</a>  then a couple of others that for various reasons, the negotiations are yet to commence but we're certainly in contact with and in regular communication with representatives from those units and looking forward to sitting down with them in the near future. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3665.966s">Sometimes</a>  this is specifically codified in a ground rule and other times it's not, but the district's position is that the specifics of proposals that are exchanged at the table should remain confidential. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3676.894s">Oftentimes</a>  when you see a specific proposal in a vacuum taken out of context, it can be quite misleading. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3683.118s">And</a>  so not wanting to try to put an emphasis on transparency in this case means that we're not as an administration going to get into the specific proposals that we have made or that we've received from our bargaining partners. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3696.367s">That</a>  being said, there are some overarching objectives that transcend each of our negotiations, and those are listed here. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3705.193s">Now</a>  I should have told you to zoom in on it, Dr. Cushman, so I could see it, but certainly the quality of instruction, thank you, I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3713.038s">The</a>  quality of the instructional time for students is something that, as the committee knows, it's a strategic priority, it's embedded within our strategic plan, and it helps inform many of our bargaining priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3722.461s">efficiency</a>  of time and the use of time to make sure that that is yielding as positive an impact for students is another significant piece, increase in wages to maintain competitiveness while sustainability. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3735.069s">Obviously,</a>  there are two parts to that to that bullet point. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3737.791s">And</a>  there's a part that depending on where we are in the course of the bargaining cycle, the parties may want to emphasize more. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3744.699s">As</a>  you can imagine, it's not uncommon for the bargaining units to want to emphasize the competitiveness component. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3750.203s">It's</a>  not uncommon for the district to want to emphasize the sustainability component. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3754.947s">The</a>  part that I wanted to emphasize here before we move on to the next slide is that both things are true. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3760.911s">When</a>  we enter into collective bargaining negotiations, if we are going to recruit and retain the best talent to serve the children of Medford, we have to be thinking along the lines of making sure that those wage increases are competitive. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3773.261s">There's</a>  no disputing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3774.482s">You</a>  can see the final bullet point there. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3776.244s">As</a>  an administration, we try to identify the shared interests, the things that we know both will serve the interests of the organization <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3783.31s">And</a>  we'll serve the interests of the employees because there's a mutual interest in wanting people to work here. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3788.479s">We</a>  want to be a place that people want to come and teach. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3791.104s">And</a>  so that's why the competitiveness is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3794.069s">And</a>  at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3795.822s">It</a>  is incumbent upon us in district leadership to make sure that we are preserving the necessary flexibility to respond to needs in the future and to make sure that we're not creating structural deficits. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3808.184s">And</a>  that's why that sustainability is something that for us always has to be paired with the competitiveness. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3813.946s">And</a>  I would say, frankly, I'm not going to speak on behalf of the unions this evening, but generally speaking, we've had good constructive dialogue <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3821.287s">with</a>  our bargaining partners. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3822.628s">And</a>  no one is advocating necessarily for blowing holes in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3828.874s">But</a>  as the administration ultimately being responsible for the integrity of the budget and making sure that it's there to respond to our needs in the future, that is something that we have to prioritize and we have to continue to do going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3841.905s">Dr.</a>  Christian, you can move to the next one now. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3843.666s">And</a>  then as we get to this next slide, <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3847.338s">you</a>  will see that there are four tables. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3851.619s">And</a>  I'm going to move left to right. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3854.52s">And</a>  this is probably confirming the statements earlier that the most fun part of the evening is over. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3858.902s">I</a>  recognize that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3860.002s">I</a>  appreciate your indulgence. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3861.763s">But</a>  as we move left to right, this slide attempts to show the connection between what we're doing at the bargaining table <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3869.725s">and</a>  what we need to do with regard to having a sound fiscal stewardship of the district in fiscal year 23. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3875.827s">So</a>  these, and by the way, these are numbers that in various presentations you've all seen before, they're tied here together in tonight's presentation to emphasize how this is connected to our collective bargaining strategies. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3888.31s">So</a>  you'll see that in FY21, the district's operating budget was $62.3 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3893.931s">In</a>  FY22, that's our current fiscal year, our operating budget rose 8.2% to $67.4 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3901.473s">All</a>  of you sat through in one capacity or another, I imagine, our budget process last spring, and we've updated you on a quarterly basis since then. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3911.195s">And</a>  as you know, that increase in costs <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3915.049s">There</a>  was a direct correlation between the supports and services that we're providing to students, particularly in the hopefully in the wake of the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3923.178s">And</a>  that is largely where you saw that increase, you also know, and you can see, in the second row here that, as we presented in the budget last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3930.705s">and</a>  as we've done so throughout this fiscal year, that there is a budgeted amount of 2% with regard to a cost of living increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3939.551s">I'm</a>  not speaking specifically to what we may or may not have proposed related to wage increases, but as we've said throughout the year and our obligations, we are a public entity, so there aren't any hidden lines in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3953.28s">What</a>  we've presented consistently is that the budgeted cost of living increase is 2%. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3960.865s">If</a>  you look to the bottom row here in this first table, you'll see that for FY22 and FY23, these are our fixed cost increases. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3974.355s">Our</a>  fixed cost increases, which you as a committee hear about each time we have one of these budget updates and leading up to a fiscal year, are the increases in next year's fiscal budget that decisions for which have already been made. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3989.545s">So</a>  the most commonly discussed would be your steps and lanes. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=3993.608s">Those</a>  are contractual increases that are owed to our employees that are due in FY23, regardless of what we negotiate. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4000.852s">Now,</a>  the steps and lanes are not $2.4 to $2.6 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4003.354s">They're</a>  about $800,000 or so, if there's a different number on it, $1.1 million, excuse me. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4013.28s">So</a>  it's a large percentage, but it's not the entirety of the fixed cost increases. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4017.603s">If</a>  you move now, Dr. Cushing, over to that table in the middle, if you could, on this same slide.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4023.166s">Can</a>  I just have a point of information, Mayor? <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4024.947s">Point</a>  of information, just if you could share what steps and lanes are for folks who are watching who don't know.</p>

    <p>[Gordon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4029.089s">Thank</a>  you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4029.61s">McLaughlin.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4030.05s">That's</a>  a good question. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4031.931s">So</a>  in our collective bargaining agreement, <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4034.342s">There</a>  are wage tables and this is essentially true for all collective bargaining agreements. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4038.746s">There</a>  are a few exceptions and the specifics of the wage table varies from unit to unit. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4044.951s">However,</a>  as an employer of approximately 100 people, approximately 500 being in the teacher's unit, that wage table is the biggest driver of the budget as it is in any school district. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4055.521s">And</a>  typically other wage tables, while possibly somewhat more simplified than the teachers, follow along a somewhat similar pattern. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4065.41s">The</a>  easiest way to think about it is that you have step increases that are typically represented by rows that mean increases year over year individual salaries based on experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4077.681s">As</a>  an educator accumulates experience, the contract contemplates essentially an increase in the monetary value associated with that employee and the step increase is representative of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4088.79s">the</a>  lane increases, which are a much more modest budgetary impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4092.312s">And</a>  so for this conversation, I think, frankly, not worth a lot of time, but those are essentially professional development and credits that the educator accumulates, ideally with a nexus between what they're studying and what, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4109.795s">the</a>  work that they're doing, and in recognition of that added value, there are compensation increases that are implemented throughout the fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4117.457s">But</a>  again, the lanes, we always sort of, in contract world, talk about them in conjunction with one another, but the steps are a significantly greater budgetary impact than the lanes. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4126.759s">Thank</a>  you for asking that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4129.88s">So</a>  as we move to the middle table there, you can see that, and as we presented in the previous FY23 budget updates, the steps and lanes and other contractual increases are not the only fixed cost increases that we're seeing. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4146.633s">Some</a>  are related to energy and utilities, and those are ones, obviously, that we monitor and we try to identify efficiencies as best we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4152.878s">But</a>  when we know we're a quarter million dollars over in <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4156.56s">utilities</a>  bill in a previous fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4158.102s">That's</a>  something that we have to plan for in the succeeding fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4161.805s">We</a>  are, as I mentioned in the previous meeting, in this previous update, in the third year of a three-year contract with our primary bus vendor, Eastern Bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4169.932s">And</a>  so that contract, which is in its final year, is seeing a $50,000 fixed cost increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4175.136s">And</a>  then with regard to the other major driver, and this is a change from the last fixed cost increase update, if you remember last fiscal year, <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4182.242s">We</a>  started with a fixed cost increase at one number, and it went up over the course of the budget process. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4189.124s">That's</a>  because as new information becomes available to us, we have a responsibility to update those numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4193.425s">We</a>  now have greater clarity with regard to our special education fixed cost increases. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4198.507s">That's</a>  our out-of-district tuitions and specialized transportation for the most part. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4202.528s">Right</a>  now, we're projecting that at $750,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4205.929s">So</a>  I think the question, and then if you go to the third table, there are, as there always are at this point in the fiscal year.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4213.931s">What</a>  information, member Rousseau?</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4215.552s">Those</a>  are just the increases. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4216.972s">So</a>  when it says $200,000 for gas, it is not that we're spending $200,000 on gas, we're spending $200,000 more than we did this year.</p>

    <p>[Gordon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4224.854s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Rousseau, and I probably did breeze over that point too quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4229.136s">Our</a>  utilities bill is significantly higher than $200,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4231.896s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4234.286s">So</a>  even when we turn the lights off every night, we can't get it below that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4237.828s">So</a>  that third table there, there are some question marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4240.889s">And</a>  you'll recall in the previous budget update, there's a strategic decision that has to be made with regard to the staffing support to be associated with the new math curriculum that the district has adopted. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4253.354s">That's</a>  not a decision that's been made yet, but if we have no staffing support associated with that, which is not going to be the recommendation of the administration, we are still at a $200,000 fixed-cost increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4266.819s">So</a>  in the bottom table there on the right, and I thank Dr. Cushing for the sound navigation of this, <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4275.973s">fixed</a>  cost increases somewhere between 2.4 and $2.6 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4280.415s">That</a>  means that if the district were to not enter into any new successor agreements, which is not our goal, it is not our preference. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4288.178s">I'm</a>  confident it is not the preference of the vast majority of our employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4292.8s">But</a>  if there were no successor agreements, we would already be at approximately $2.5 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4298.782s">I'm</a>  not gonna use the term whole or deficit because I think there are too many other variables. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4302.723s">And</a>  I think frankly, <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4304.744s">term</a>  that finance administrators throw around on a too liberal a basis in these types of discussions each year. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4312.29s">But</a>  there's $2.5 million in added costs that we have to prepare for. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4317.593s">And</a>  when we reference back the FY21 to FY22 budgetary increase of <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4326.358s">8%,</a>  assuming as I think we have a responsibility to do that, that can't increase at that number every single year, that $2.5 million does represent a significant challenge to the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4339.407s">It</a>  does not eliminate the priority that I referenced at the beginning of this discussion, which is that in order for us to recruit and retain talent, we have to both have wage increases that are competitive and sustainable. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4353.317s">And</a>  the sustainable part, frankly, is just as relevant to the recruitment and retention objective, because if we do create those structural deficits, and if there is that type of instability in the system that leads to significant layoffs, that leads to an inability to staff positions appropriately, that leads to the district's inability to set to staff positions that support high-need students, it becomes that much more challenging to do this work and do this work effectively. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4380.502s">And</a>  so while our commitment to competitive and sustainable wage increases is authentic, and it is legitimate, and it is a necessity for us to run this organization in a sound way, it is not a priority that can be looked at in a vacuum. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4393.971s">It</a>  has to be looked at in this context. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4395.692s">If</a>  we could go to the next slide, and there's just a few other points, and then I'd be more than happy to take the committee's questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4404.298s">The</a>  projected budgetary impact of the increases is $1 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4408.519s">You</a>  can see, as I reported last time, Massachusetts is seeing a significant increase in Chapter 70 funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4415.301s">That</a>  is true across the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4417.021s">That</a>  is true in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4418.341s">We</a>  typically average approximately $140,000 increase in Chapter 70 funding, and our Chapter 70 funding increase this year is $1.6 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4427.904s">That's</a>  significant, and it's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4430.185s">However,</a>  it's also as I will reference momentarily, a double edged sword, because, and this is the short version of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4437.413s">The</a>  chapter 70 number only represents 20% of the Medford public schools operating budget we are largely a local contribution district. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4444.861s">And</a>  so even with that number going up, and there's a somewhat corresponding number going up with respect to our local contribution, it represents only a fraction of our budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4453.926s">And</a>  then to sort of put a final bow on that point as to why it's not necessarily something that we can pop champagne bottles over, Medford is already over by a significant margin. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4467.654s">the</a>  net school spending number that the state requires. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4470.936s">And</a>  so that $1.6 million, while the district will absolutely advocate for it, you will hear it in the budget presentations, I would expect the school committee to advocate to the municipal government on our behalf to make sure that that number is represented in the increase we see in FY23. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4485.144s">Because</a>  it's such a small percentage and because we are already over the net school spending number, it does not represent a significant material impact on where we are from FY22 to FY23.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4496.732s">Point</a>  of information there. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4499.134s">Point</a>  of information, Member McLaughlin, just a brief explanation of Chapter 70.</p>

    <p>[Gordon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4502.778s">Absolutely,</a>  Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4503.258s">McLaughlin,</a>  and thank you again for keeping an eye on my moving through things too quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4512.046s">I</a>  think I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4514.088s">So</a>  in Massachusetts, under Education Reform Act of 1993, there's something called net school spending. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4520.234s">So</a>  every municipality in Massachusetts <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4522.956s">has</a>  two numbers that are issued at every budget season. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4527.978s">There's</a>  the Chapter 70 number, which is essentially the amount of money that we are going to receive from Beacon Hill. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4534.601s">It's</a>  money that comes from taxpayers across the Commonwealth, and the rationale behind the Chapter 70 number is that the residents of Malden, the residents of Arlington, the residents of Attleboro, the residents of Boston, <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4545.839s">have</a>  an obligation to support the Medford public schools in educating our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4552.302s">And</a>  your taxpayer dollars also go and support Chapter 70 funding to states across the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4559.566s">The</a>  local contribution number is the minimum number amount of money that the municipal government in each city and town must allocate to its school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4567.929s">And</a>  those numbers together is the foundation budget and the net school spending number. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4571.851s">And</a>  there's a host of other complexities to it with regard to offsets and what <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4575.753s">a</a>  city or town can take credit for that I don't think are necessarily relevant for this conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4581.598s">But</a>  I think understanding that our budget is made up of a chapter 70 number coming from the state and a local contribution number coming from the municipal government is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4590.106s">The</a>  breakdown as to what percentage is in each is designed, at least according to the drafters, and I'm not going to editorialize on <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4599.441s">the</a>  specifics of it tonight, to be representative of the socioeconomic dynamics of the community and of the needs of the students of that community. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4607.704s">And</a>  so it is supposed to establish a floor, not a ceiling, but a floor as to that community's investment and the Commonwealth's investment in education in that community. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4624.517s">I</a>  think I answered that one, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4625.838s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4626.238s">All</a>  right, if we'll go to the next slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4627.879s">And</a>  so, again, I'll be as efficient as I can and ask that those members of the committee hold me accountable for anything that we skip over. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4637.145s">But</a>  the five boxes here, I don't know that we need to zoom in on all of them other than the sort of bottom left-hand corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4647.011s">Those</a>  represent the priorities that have been identified through the budget process to date. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4651.653s">So</a>  these are your supports for high-need learners, the staffing positions that we see as critical priorities, the professional learning that we want to make sure that our educators and staff can benefit from, and the equity supports that we believe can help close the opportunity gaps that some of our high-need and most vulnerable populations face. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4670.003s">are</a>  experiencing. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4671.144s">In</a>  the bottom left here, you see the numbers that I've shared with you tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4674.589s">It's</a>  approximately a $2.5 million with regard to fixed costs, $1.6 million increase with regard to Chapter 70. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4683.58s">And</a>  so that becomes the question is, is that the deficit that has to be filled? <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4687.584s">And</a>  the answer, I said not exactly here, but the answer is essentially no for a couple of reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4691.366s">One,</a>  as I said, I think using those types of terms can be misleading, so I'm going to try to avoid it. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4697.188s">But</a>  also because that $2.5 million fixed cost increase does not represent any cost of living increase beyond what has already been budgeted for. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4707.333s">And</a>  so if we are going to be committed to competitive and sustainable wage increases, and if we have nine collective bargaining agreements, one could presume <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4716.533s">that</a>  that number will end up being higher than it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4719.754s">And</a>  because we've already spoken about how it can be misleading to put all of our eggs in the $1.6 million Chapter 70 basket, you can see that that deficit, again, it's a deficit in this moment, because those are where the numbers are, is more significant than the numbers that are represented here. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4739.782s">If</a>  we go to the next slide, there's just a few final points, and then I will fulfill my commitment <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4746.977s">allow</a>  you to move on with your evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4750.92s">And</a>  most of these have been covered. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4752.601s">Again,</a>  you've heard me speak to our commitment with regard to the wage increases, the local contribution implications. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4760.126s">The</a>  other bullet point as to like, how is it that we're gonna do those priorities that are listed there in those five boxes? <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4765.91s">We</a>  do have external funding available to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4768.813s">And</a>  as we reported earlier, we're expecting to have spent approximately $1.4 million in our ESSER funding and FY <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4776.078s">22.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4776.198s">That</a>  is lower than what we had initially projected, although there's been a significant amount of very good usage of that funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4784.91s">That</a>  is the funding that we've used to host acceleration programs, particularly in math at the elementary level. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4792.74s">There's</a>  been camp Mustang programs focused on SEL both during the summer and school vacations, and they've been a variety of other programs and initiatives including the formation of an engagement team expansion of free transportation for high school students, all of that has gone into has come from the s or bucket, and as a general rule, and this excuse me it's not really general it's more like federal federal regulation. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4813.921s">the</a>  propriety of the ESSER expenditures are based on the nexus between what it is that we're expending it on and the impact of the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4822.43s">So</a>  it is not a bucket of money to just use for any purpose, nor is it reoccurring funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4828.917s">And</a>  for purposes of this conversation, that's really the most relevant point with regard to the ESSER. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4833.118s">ESSER</a>  is a temporary grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4835.339s">It</a>  is a significant amount of money that the district has a responsibility to make sure that we're using wisely and on behalf of students, but it is a money with an expiration date, both in the sense that we have to spend it and that there's no indication at this point, at least, that it would be renewed at any point in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4853.735s">And</a>  then I think the last bullet point just speaks to, and this is not specific to FY23, our responsibility as a district is always to be looking for efficiencies, to be identifying savings when possible, and making sure that where we can repurpose funding in a way that better serves students, it's our obligation to be continuously looking for those opportunities. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4879.81s">So</a>  just with regard to the plans moving forward, we will continue to negotiate in good faith with each of our collective bargaining partners. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4888.898s">We</a>  are grateful both to the educators and staff who have been exceedingly patient over the course of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4897.625s">I</a>  understand that there's frustration that's being expressed in a variety of forms and that's perfectly understandable and we respect that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4906.29s">I've</a>  detailed tonight our responsibilities and we're gonna continue to do our best to fulfill those and do it in a professional and constructive manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4914.395s">And</a>  with that, I'm more than happy to take your questions.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4916.996s">Thank</a>  you, Duff. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4917.717s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Murphy, Attorney Murphy. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4919.238s">Are</a>  there any questions from the committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4922.96s">Member</a>  Graham.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4925.321s">I</a>  just wanna make sure I'm clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4927.763s">So</a>  the 2% COLA that you referenced that was in the FY22 budget, <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4936.235s">equates</a>  to how much money?</p>

    <p>[Gordon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4937.957s">$1</a>  million.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4939.178s">And</a>  that is across all bargaining units, or is that just the teachers contract?</p>

    <p>[Gordon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4943.701s">It</a>  is across all bargaining units with the exception of the non-unit employees, but the non-unit employees represent such a small fraction of the organization that it would be more than a rounding error, but it would be approximately $75,000 or so, maybe $85,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4956.973s">But</a>  the 1 million represents all 10 bargaining units. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4963.413s">So</a>  I should just say, as I do each, all of these are, are approximations. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4967.994s">They're</a>  none of them are to the penny, all of them though. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4970.635s">If,</a>  if I, if there's a, you know, the, the $1.1 million I believe might be a 1,900,000 or 50 or something along those lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4980.137s">So,</a>  okay.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4981.938s">So</a>  2% equals a million dollars and that is for all units. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4986.819s">That's</a>  correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4987.299s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4988.079s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4988.439s">And</a>  that's for FY 22. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4989.22s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4990.99s">So</a>  for FY23, 2% would equal more than $1 million.</p>

    <p>[Gordon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4995.493s">And</a>  I think that's an important, I appreciate that, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4998.075s">Graham.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=4999.556s">All</a>  wage increases that go into a wage scale have a compounding impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5002.878s">And</a>  so I don't have that number in front of me right now, but I would imagine it's about 1.1, 1.2, somewhere in that range, maybe a little bit less. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5011.621s">And</a>  obviously the number of employees has an impact on that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5015.122s">And</a>  I think that if you look at the priorities that we've identified throughout the budget process, one of the terms you've heard me say, I'm gonna avoid talking about deficits that only exist on paper, at least for this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5030.967s">But</a>  one of the points that you've heard me say many times in your budget updates is that the budget for a school system is almost all people. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5039.494s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5040.035s">So</a>  of our $67 million $55 million are in personnel costs and salaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5046.442s">That</a>  is not just that's not specific to the Medford public schools that's all public school systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5051.488s">And</a>  I imagine the teachers who are short on supplies and are always looking for copy paper and they all the other things, so many things that are broken, they can attest to the fact that that's not typically where the money goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5061.156s">And</a>  it shouldn't because it's the people that are going to make the difference in terms of having an impact on our students and particularly true for our most vulnerable students. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5070.318s">And</a>  so we don't wanna get into situations in which we're saying, well, if we give you that raise, we've gotta lay off this many people because I continue to believe that we can get to a place where we can have a competitive sustainable wage increase and still provide the level of staffing support that we believe is necessary to serve students in this particular moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5090.942s">But</a>  as much as we don't want to engage in some of that rhetoric, it is just a basic fact that if the strategic priority is making sure that there are staffing supports in place to be responsive to this particular moment, <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5108.516s">And</a>  if we end up in a situation which we give wage increases that may be morally and a variety of other ways fully justified, then that will cause a deficit and there will be only one way to bridge that deficit. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5121.122s">And</a>  I understand that that's not a message that resonates frankly and one that I don't think it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5127.059s">you</a>  know, one that I think people in this district and many others want to debate. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5131.686s">And</a>  frankly, it's not a choice that I think school districts should have to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5135.613s">But</a>  I don't think I'm doing my job if I don't report that that is a choice the district has to make.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5143.816s">And</a>  the I guess the other question I had the last two years of the two years since I've been on the committee have been budget anomalies in terms of like what historically has happened here in Medford from a net increase of our budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5158.181s">So</a>  last year we got like a whatever was seven 8% increase something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5165.083s">8.2.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5165.103s">The</a>  year before that, we got zero in the early days of the pandemic, which we had to continue to meet all our increases. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5173.607s">So</a>  it was like effectively a net loss of money that we would have come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5179.169s">What</a>  is our history in Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5181.189s">So</a>  what is a typical increase from the municipality</p>

    <p>[Gordon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5186.756s">local</a>  contribution.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5187.576s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Gordon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5188.016s">So</a>  just like the average. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5190.097s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5191.057s">The</a>  average chapter 70 increase is, as I said, it's about $140,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5196.739s">So</a>  it's a significant difference between what we're experiencing and FY 20. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5201.541s">I</a>  should, by the way, I should qualify that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5203.241s">The</a>  $1.6 million is the governor's proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5206.723s">I</a>  think that was in an asterisk there in the legislature right now, which typically that means that that's a good starting point. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5215.346s">But</a>  the state budget is not adopted yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5218.267s">So</a>  all of this is a little premature in that sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5222.149s">The</a>  average personnel <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5224.91s">increase</a>  percentage is approximately 4% total. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5230.235s">That's</a>  counting the cost of living increases and the steps and lanes. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5234.078s">And</a>  I'm doing this based off of the documentation that I inherited. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5237.721s">As</a>  you all know, I was not here for witnessing any of this myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5240.483s">And</a>  so, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5242.024s">keep</a>  that in mind, but that's what the personnel increases are. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5248.048s">I'm</a>  sure if I, you know, took a break and scribbled a bunch of stuff, I could then do the math and figure out what the local contribution is, but it corresponds with those numbers essentially. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5256.754s">And</a>  I can provide the more detailed data if you'd like to see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5259.976s">And</a>  it is significantly smaller than the increase we saw between FY22, excuse me, FY21 and FY22. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5266.34s">There's</a>  no question about that.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5268.453s">And</a>  so that 4% would also include any additional positions that are added year to year.</p>

    <p>[Gordon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5275.555s">That's</a>  correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5276.795s">And</a>  vice versa, if positions are eliminated in order to sustain those increases, that would also be reflected in that number. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5285.937s">What</a>  will be consistent is it will always drive the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5288.738s">There</a>  will always be 80% somewhere around there with regard to personal costs.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5293.999s">And</a>  how many positions did we add? <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5297.093s">from</a>  the last fiscal year, roughly? <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5298.734s">I</a>  feel like there were a good number of positions added in the last year.</p>

    <p>[Gordon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5302.755s">Is</a>  that true? <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5304.496s">There</a>  were positions added. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5306.096s">I</a>  would estimate it's in the 15 to 20 position range. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5311.778s">The</a>  majority of those being grant-funded positions that are specific to providing high-need, I'm using the term post-pandemic with the understanding that it's not technically over, but hopefully post-bulk of the pandemic realities that we were experiencing.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5326.852s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Gordon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5327.492s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5328.633s">Thank</a>  you, Member Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5329.253s">Member</a>  Ruseau?</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5330.573s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5330.954s">I</a>  just wanted to provide a little more sort of to answer the question about our historical increases year over year. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5338.276s">From</a>  2007 to 2012, we increased by 1.9% total over the course of those five years.</p>

    <p>[Gordon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5346.192s">That</a>  was, again, before my time.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5348.894s">But,</a>  you know, we added $869,000 over the course of five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5353.376s">So</a>  how on earth we functioned and ran a district during that time is sort of a fascinating thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5360.941s">I'm</a>  sure somebody could write a book on. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5363.382s">But,</a>  you know, we have plenty of years for which we not only didn't increase, but we even cut. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5368.666s">2010,</a>  we cut. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5369.806s">2011,</a>  we <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5373.28s">added</a>  enough to buy a copier. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5376.342s">So</a>  I, you know, I'm happy that since 2013, it looks like we have been doing the percentage increases that are still probably too low in my book, but at least they're not like, what is going on? <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5393.412s">These</a>  zero percents and these cuts year over year, I don't even know how we functioned and I'm sure there's plenty of people here who were here then and could tell me, but, <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5403.507s">It</a>  must've been interesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5404.668s">So</a>  I just did have that data and I wanted to provide some context.</p>

    <p>[Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5409.072s">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5411.474s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[U1EIl_L-LWc_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5413.495s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Murphy. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5414.156s">Thank</a>  you, mayor.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5471.428s">I</a>  shared this earlier with everyone.</p>

    <p>[Reporter 1]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5473.706s">It's</a>  the slide presentation I'm not going to go into in detail, but I just wanted you to have some background information, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5480.767s">So</a>  I appreciate that, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5482.968s">So</a>  Charlene Douglas, 414 High Street, Medford Mass, President of the Medford Teachers Association. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5489.629s">Esteemed</a>  Mayor and members of the Medford School Committee, I am here tonight on behalf of every MTA member to voice our frustration with the delays in settling a fair contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5503.976s">Today</a>  began Teacher Appreciation Week. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5510.0s">Yet</a>  tonight, I come before you to state that teachers feel undervalued and not respected by this district. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5519.547s">During</a>  the past three years of the pandemic, you have seen our educators perform exemplary work during the most challenging times that most of us have ever seen. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5530.675s">Method</a>  educators learn new educational <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5533.735s">Teaching</a>  practices adapted entire curriculums to meet the ever-changing needs of students and the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5540.637s">They</a>  were available at all times of the day to support students' emotional needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5544.959s">They</a>  aided students who were struggling with remote learning or challenging home situations. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5550.641s">Our</a>  educators navigated through these practices to ensure that children stayed connected to school, they were there then, and they continue to be there for the children of Medford as we all, and I mean all of us, worked together to protect the health and safety of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5572.036s">Medford</a>  schools form the backbone of this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5576.82s">That</a>  was on full display throughout this pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5581.562s">or</a>  the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5584.744s">The</a>  pandemic has taught us how important it is to have skilled and committed workforce in our public schools, especially as teachers across the country are leaving this profession in drones. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5598.174s">And</a>  I wanna emphasize drones. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5601.316s">The</a>  lack of a fair contract and the absence of respect shown to method educators all threatened to undermine <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5608.837s">the</a>  quality of our public schools, and that our students deserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5614.059s">We</a>  know that teachers' working conditions are students' learning conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5621.102s">The</a>  district offered the smallest cost of living increase that we have received in the last six years, while the district received the largest increase in Chapter 70 money over the last decade. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5638.717s">This,</a>  while the cost of our basic needs, food on the table, gas, health insurance premiums, are going up at a rate of over 7% inflation. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5650.979s">Our</a>  budget shows the value of its organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5654.68s">It</a>  is clear from the way the district is treating educators at the bargaining table that they do not value the educators of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5665.842s">Young</a>  teachers are fleeing in droves. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5668.775s">An</a>  average of 50% of new teachers leave in the first three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5676.158s">And</a>  our veteran colleagues are seeking employment in other districts and even going to new fields. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5685.623s">The</a>  federal government has provided more than $48 million to Medford and its school to address <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5697.998s">the</a>  impacts of the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5700.239s">The</a>  state is on track to fully fund the Student Opportunity Act and increase the funding given to our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5711.364s">We</a>  must use these investments to benefit our students, and there is no greater resource for our students than an excellent teaching force. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5721.058s">In</a>  this way, the cost of living and other ways discussions are vital in continuing to meet the needs of our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5730.384s">The</a>  Method Teachers Association is seeking a fair contract that acknowledges the experience and dedication of educators currently working in the district and that will retain and continue to attract highly skilled educators. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5748.789s">We</a>  need a contract that meets the needs of our students in a variety of ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5754.552s">Our</a>  contract proposals were written to show our dedication to meeting the needs of our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5761.836s">What</a>  do we ask for? <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5763.277s">We</a>  ask that the newcomers program's class size be capped to 12 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5769.52s">We</a>  ask the district implement a cap. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5772.765s">on</a>  the number of students who receive special ed services to be less than 50% within a general education setting. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5784.273s">We</a>  ask that the high school teachers who work in co-teaching classrooms receive one period of a shared prep time and that teachers receive proper, and I wanna emphasize, proper training on co-teaching strategies <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5802.931s">online,</a>  so educators will have the time and space to give students the careful attention they deserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5812.997s">One</a>  of the district's proposals <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5815.137s">is</a>  to take away individual prep time from our elementary classroom teachers to allow for at the discretion of the principal, instructional common planning time with all grade level teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5827.469s">Please</a>  understand, we're not opposed to common planning time. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5832.675s">However,</a>  it cannot come at the expense of losing individual planning time. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5838.635s">I</a>  have asked the elementary teachers to share with you how valuable individual individual prep time is and how they will use it to plan appropriate differentiated instructional lessons for all five subjects they teach to meet the needs of the very diverse population within the classrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5859.804s">Tonight,</a>  we shared with each of you a packet of how teachers use their prep time. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5866.53s">It</a>  was also emailed to you prior this evening at this meeting as a slideshow. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5872.995s">When</a>  you read the packet or view the packet or the slideshow, you will learn how teachers use this valuable individual preparation time. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5882.504s">I</a>  ask it to review this material and urge you to support us. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5887.511s">All</a>  teachers deserve preparation time every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5892.562s">Not</a>  four days a week, every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5910.27s">The</a>  MTA is prepared and eager to bargain and sell a contract that will justly reflect our members' commitment to the Method public schools, and that will ensure that Method can provide the best possible education to every student attending our schools, today and in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=5933.238s">I</a>  thank you for your time.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6047.143s">Member</a>  Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6048.984s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6049.184s">Douglas,</a>  I just had one more question for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6051.626s">I</a>  think maybe it's just me. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6053.748s">So</a>  I just wanted to make sure, Dr. Edouard-Vincent said that you all are planning to meet tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6058.212s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6058.692s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6059.233s">My</a>  question, I think it's moot now, was like, are you telling us you're at impasse on these issues? <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6064.217s">And</a>  I think the answer <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6065.558s">based</a>  on what I just heard is that that conversation is continuing.</p>

    <p>[Reporter 1]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6068.561s">We</a>  continue to be at the table, but we want you to realize that we feel very, very strong about some of the issues that we have brought forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6077.01s">And</a>  I don't want to get into the weeds of our negotiations, but this body, as many conciliatory <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6088.953s">things</a>  for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6090.154s">I</a>  know you were looking at the Wednesday early release day. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6093.738s">We</a>  came at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6095.019s">We've</a>  given up 26 hours of our personal professional development time and everything, because we know it is important to be there for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6108.253s">What</a>  we are losing is remediation time. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6111.835s">One</a>  of those Wednesdays, some of those Wednesdays were devoted to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6114.718s">That</a>  is a loss. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6115.9s">But</a>  we know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6117.542s">And</a>  we did ask for something in its place, and we're close on a lot of things, okay, on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6122.968s">But</a>  we want a decent raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6125.11s">We</a>  really do. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6127.033s">2%</a>  isn't gonna work for us.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6146.974s">Maybe</a>  this is the most fun we're going to have tonight, right?</p>

    <p>[Reporter 1]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6149.635s">And</a>  I was really offended to think you thought I wasn't fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6155.776s">I</a>  always thought I was a nice person. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6158.857s">I'm</a>  strong, very open-minded. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6161.197s">I'll</a>  be the first to admit that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6162.918s">And</a>  you know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6164.158s">I</a>  think many of you can remember one time I told a school committee member to sit down and be quiet until I'm done talking.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6171.4s">So</a>  I know that you know that that's who I am. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6174.18s">So</a>  the last thing I want to say is, <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6176.943s">I</a>  don't think because of the confidentiality we have in place, I don't think any of us are in a position to or at liberty to like respond to any of the specific things you've talked about tonight because they are supposed to be at the bargaining table. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6189.406s">I</a>  would ask that you guys continue to do what you've been doing and show up to the bargaining table and be creative and work together. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6195.768s">I</a>  think one of the ways we have navigated this pandemic better than so many communities is we've done that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6201.889s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6202.789s">I</a>  do want to say thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6203.93s">I</a>  know this is hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6205.45s">I</a>  know negotiating is never fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6208.592s">You</a>  will never be happy at the end of a negotiation, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6211.273s">That's</a>  just sort of the nature of a negotiation, sadly. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6214.354s">You'll</a>  never be completely happy.</p>

    <p>[Reporter 1]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6217.195s">I</a>  think that, so I've been negotiating for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6220.076s">This</a>  is not my first go around. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6221.357s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6222.737s">So,</a>  and I can say honestly that <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6227.908s">that</a>  the benefit teacher association has a great deal of respect for the negotiation process. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6232.53s">And</a>  I even think Dr. Murphy, Mr. Murphy, you are.</p>

    <p>[Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6238.894s">Attorney.</a> </p>

    <p>[Reporter 1]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6239.534s">I</a>  was going to call you professor, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6242.335s">I</a>  think that Mr. Murphy even made reference to that tonight when he spoke. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6247.238s">So,</a>  you know, I do think that we will, but we do want you to be aware that there are things that <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6253.741s">that</a>  we're very concerned about and we wanna make sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6256.663s">And</a>  we have, we think that, we know that there are other districts giving sizable incentives. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6263.007s">I'll</a>  give you one example. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6264.568s">Arlington</a>  just gave every one of their teachers a bonus of $500 if they agreed to get a booster shot. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6270.751s">$500</a>  to get a booster shot. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6273.993s">Ask</a>  what we got. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6275.254s">That's</a>  all I'm gonna say.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6277.515s">So</a>  Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6278.036s">Douglas,</a>  just one more thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6280.799s">She</a>  keeps trying to run away. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6282.239s">So</a>  I did want to say thank you and happy Teacher Appreciation Week to all of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6288.361s">You</a>  make a difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6289.481s">It</a>  matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6290.301s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6291.562s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6292.322s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6293.102s">Mia,</a>  did you have a question?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6296.723s">I'll</a>  stay.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6298.823s">I</a>  think we all feel how Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6300.984s">Graham</a>  just put it. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6301.964s">We</a>  appreciate our teachers more than you know, and we could go on and on, but happy Teacher Appreciation Week. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6309.795s">Teacher</a>  Appreciation Week, we do appreciate you. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6311.877s">We</a>  hope we can work towards a resolution to this.</p>

    <p>[Reporter 1]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6315.42s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6317.081s">Anyone</a>  else? <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6317.582s">Any</a>  other questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6319.183s">Any</a>  other questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6320.604s">None?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6321.525s">None?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6321.765s">Okay,</a>  so I do think there's people on the floor waiting to talk on this very same topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6325.869s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6326.249s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6326.97s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6350.94s">If</a>  we're gonna have speakers, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6352.681s">We're</a>  just gonna give you two minutes each and I'll keep time, but name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[South]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6358.504s">Good</a>  evening, Madam Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6361.92s">Good</a>  evening, Madam Mayor, Superintendent, Dr. Morris, and school committee members. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6368.807s">My</a>  name is Steven South, 106 Damon Road, Medford, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6373.671s">I'm</a>  a homeowner, a taxpayer, I have a child that attends Medford Public Schools, and I am also the Secretary-Treasurer of Teamsters Local 25. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6385.262s">So</a>  first I wanted to thank everybody in the audience and those that could make it and those that could not make it teachers administrators security custodians. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6398.739s">lunch</a>  personnel, crossing guards, everybody that works for Medford Public Schools, I know that their work is very much needed and appreciated by not just those on this side and this side of the podium, but also by the general public. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6415.203s">Obviously,</a>  we couldn't educate our children without everybody, so thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6421.705s">Some</a>  of the things I wanted to just touch on that President Douglas touched on is, well, <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6428.243s">Last</a>  fall, some of you just right here behind the podium were sending out publications to all of the residents bragging about the 8.2% increase in the school budget, which is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6443.149s">But</a>  then once we get to bargaining, and I represent the custodian security, the administrators, assistant principals, and so on and so forth, <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6454.668s">Once</a>  we get into bargaining all of a sudden, you know there's there's no no money to be had and I know I know that you on this side are talking about keeping things confidential but I think it's important that everyone knows that that the city or the. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6471.337s">Central</a>  Administration has been proposing one or 2% raises per year. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6476.743s">I</a>  know everybody has been watching the news and knows that we are in the highest inflation rates since many of us have been alive in the last 40, 50 years at 8.5% as of last month. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6487.916s">That's</a>  year over year. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6492.601s">and</a>  offering one or 2% raises. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6495.123s">I</a>  can tell you, Local 25, we negotiate with dozens of cities and towns in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6501.729s">We've</a>  settled many contracts in the last 12 months, and no one has settled for 2% or anywhere near. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6509.155s">We're</a>  all north of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6511.217s">So...</a>  I do... <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6518.971s">I</a>  do want to be clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6520.632s">I</a>  know President Douglas was pretty clear, but I want to be explicitly clear that none of the unions are going to settle for 2%. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6528.856s">That</a>  is a pay cut when you look at inflation. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6534.018s">It's</a>  not feasible. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6535.659s">And</a>  I know David Murphy was talking about being competitive, but also sustainability. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6542.703s">And</a>  being competitive, 2% is not even remotely competitive. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6548.005s">And</a>  if you need to do 2% raises to stay afloat, that's problematic.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6553.448s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. South. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6555.729s">We</a>  have a number of speakers.</p>

    <p>[South]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6557.13s">I'll</a>  make the rest of this brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6561.452s">Those</a>  of you up at the podium were bragging about the 8.2%. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6566.415s">In</a>  this fiscal year, the central administration has been making cuts, including at the end of March when you eliminated the position of security guard.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6575.279s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. South.</p>

    <p>[South]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6576.16s">Mr.</a>  McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6576.98s">We</a>  have also- Thank you, Mr. South, that's over three minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6580.201s">Would</a>  anybody else like to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6581.842s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6582.062s">O'Brien.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6582.642s">We</a>  have also eliminated having security people at door 31 for after school events. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6594.546s">We</a>  have three minutes, we have a rule- Mr. South. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6596.947s">Mr.</a>  South. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6597.447s">Over</a>  a year.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6598.467s">Mayor.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6598.827s">Over</a>  a year.</p>

    <p>[U1EIl_L-LWc_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6600.388s">Member</a>  Ruseau.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6662.57s">but</a>  only half of us have to abide by them. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6665.111s">So</a>  when we are asked questions that we cannot answer, because that would be a Department of Labor violation, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6671.993s">But</a>  when the other side wants to violate those same rules, we don't say boo, we don't contact the Department of Labor over it. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6679.315s">Instead,</a>  you get to like, say whatever you want, and we can't respond. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6682.975s">Because</a>  if we respond, that's against the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6685.556s">So</a>  I want the rules that were agreed to for this bargaining <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6688.917s">to</a>  be publicly available so that when they are violated by anyone, including us, everybody knows what's really going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6696.121s">Because</a>  this is just, this is the same thing from the last time we had bargaining where I left the bargaining table because members of the bargaining table, not on the school committee, went on Facebook and talked about what was going on in the bargaining room, which is a violation of trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6711.13s">And</a>  I think trust is critical to a good bargaining. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6713.892s">So</a>  I want, there's a motion and a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6716.634s">I</a>  don't want a conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6717.594s">There's</a>  a motion and a second.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6719.966s">Mayor.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6720.527s">Member</a>  Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6721.948s">Can</a>  I, before we take this vote, can I ask Dr. Edward Benson and Mr. Murphy to weigh in on this motion about making the rules of engagement of negotiations public?</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6735.919s">Yeah,</a>  I'm gonna just have Mr. Murphy come forward as well, because I feel that we've been making progress, and I think we just need to honor both sides, honor the rules of engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6746.667s">Mr.</a>  Murphy, can you please weigh in?</p>

    <p>[Gordon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6749.429s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6750.129s">Thank</a>  you, Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6751.51s">Thank</a>  you, members of the committee, Mr. Soka, or whoever, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6754.412s">Graham,</a>  for the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6756.714s">What</a>  I would say is that <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6759.386s">The</a>  ground rules and all proposals that are exchanged are documents between the parties. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6766.777s">And</a>  so I would advise against a unilateral action on the part of the district via a vote of the school committee to make anything specific public, because <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6776.431s">for</a>  each bargaining unit, I would want to confer with the people we're negotiating with before we just release anything publicly. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6785.256s">I</a>  will just be candid. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6787.678s">There's</a>  some frustration that's been expressed by the committee that is shared by the administration with regard to some of the specificity. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6795.642s">As</a>  I mentioned, I think identifying a specific proposal out of context in a vacuum can be misleading, which is why <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6805.248s">that</a>  we haven't done it. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6806.789s">And</a>  I would ask the committee's indulgence to allow us to continue to not do that, because regardless of wherever the rhetoric lands or information that is presented to you as factual, that may or may not be, we are going to continue to abide by the confidentiality that we as a team believe will lead to a more constructive resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6830.146s">of</a>  what we're negotiating. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6831.166s">So</a>  I share the committee's frustration and I respect and understand the frustration on the part of our bargaining partners with regard to the timeline as well as some other issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6844.21s">But</a>  I think my recommendation to the committee and frankly to everyone would be that we get back to the bargaining table and continue to negotiate in good faith. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6853.653s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6856.714s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Murphy.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6859.583s">Mayor,</a>  if I may?</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6862.143s">Member</a>  Rossell.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6863.784s">I</a>  guess, I don't really know what the point of rules are if they are not followed by one half of the people at the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6872.625s">And</a>  I see somebody shaking her head who went to Facebook after the last collective bargaining agreement and session that I was in and divulged everything that was being discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6881.707s">It's,</a>  you know, the community, we're the seven people that get beat up and you can say anything you want, <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6889.403s">I'm</a>  not saying everybody's lying, but you also can say anything you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6893.625s">And</a>  we can't even respond to the emails. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6896.806s">We</a>  can say, thank you for your email. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6898.867s">We</a>  like our teachers too. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6900.027s">And</a>  we think they should get a big raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6901.628s">That's</a>  how I respond. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6903.629s">But</a>  you could say, we offered you zero, zero, zero. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6907.09s">And</a>  I couldn't respond and say, you asked for 20%, 20%, 20%. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6909.111s">That</a>  would be against the law for me to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6913.113s">So</a>  I just don't know what the point of bargaining partners are that aren't actually partners. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6919.952s">I'll</a>  withdraw this because I recognize that the motion as I put it was for all the bargaining agreement, bargaining partners, but I just would be nice if the other side of the table respected the process that they agreed upon, because we respect that process by staying silent and allowing the bargaining to happen according to the law.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6943.561s">Thank</a>  you, Member Ruseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6944.982s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6945.102s">O'Brien.</a> </p>

    <p>[O'Brien]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6945.642s">Hi,</a>  my name is Hannah O'Brien and I was a paraprofessional at the Roberts Elementary School for the past five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6951.385s">I</a>  know many of you, I love many of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6954.406s">I</a>  resigned about a month ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6956.067s">Resigning</a>  was the hardest decision I've ever had to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6958.888s">I</a>  was stuck between doing something that I love and not being able to survive. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6963.143s">No</a>  working person working a full-time job, especially as demanding as it is for us, should struggle to pay their mortgage, their groceries, and their gas. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6971.494s">$515</a>  biweekly. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6972.495s">$51</a>  a day I was given with a college degree. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6980.27s">to</a>  come to work and be an essential asset to our most vulnerable students. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6985.473s">Despite</a>  these conditions, I kept showing up because I thought of the student who wouldn't be able to succeed in the general ed classroom without me. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6992.978s">The</a>  student who was told that they shouldn't be in the placement they are because of their abilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=6997.582s">The</a>  student who lost their home to eviction and needed some extra love to make it through the day without a mental breakdown. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7003.085s">The</a>  student who gave me a concussion because they have so much anger and anxiety coming to school and acting like things are normal after a global pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7010.421s">Things</a>  are not normal. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7012.502s">Schools</a>  are going to continue to be the brunt of the mental health epidemic if you can't open your eyes and your wallets and realize that educators standing behind me are shaping the way for our students to function in society. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7024.57s">Teachers</a>  and support staff have worked harder than ever to ensure our students return to school as smoothly as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7031.155s">Instead</a>  of giving these workers what they deserve, which is more, you are taking and putting more on their caseloads, which I see every single day going to work, how much they're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7041.722s">You</a>  continue to push testing despite many kids not at grade level in academics right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7047.304s">I</a>  was heartbroken to see five and six year olds having anxiety attacks over the multiple testing they didn't understand because they were required to take and we weren't able to help them. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7057.589s">When</a>  will you recognize that students need to be <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7060.57s">accumulated</a>  with basic skills again in order to function in a classroom setting. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7064.775s">Why</a>  are we pretending like the last three years didn't happen and our students just know how to live again after being scared for so long, especially for our youngest learners who don't remember a time without <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7075.908s">things</a>  happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7076.769s">I</a>  started a new job two weeks ago and I haven't had to beg my bosses to meet with me like I had to do in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7083.292s">I've</a>  been invited to make decisions like I wasn't in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7086.634s">I've</a>  been told how valued I am, not by just writing a Facebook post during Teacher Appreciation Week, but by actually showing me with their actions and their pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7095.82s">So</a>  for you on the committee, my question for you is simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7098.821s">Do</a>  you want to continue to lose people who care?

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7167.52s">Hi,</a>  I'm Max Heinegg, 5 Arden Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7169.921s">I</a>  was approached by a group of veteran teachers because I've been teaching in Bedford for 24 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7175.404s">And</a>  they asked if I would read this and I read it and I said, yes, I would. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7178.805s">And</a>  afterwards, I was also told that if you would like a copy of it, we'll submit a copy of it with us, with signatures on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7187.43s">I</a>  took out a few things from what I was given because I didn't want to repeat some of the stuff that everyone has already said, because I want to respect everyone's time. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7195.033s">but</a>  I'd like to address the school committee, the mayor and the superintendent, and say I'm glad to be here to speak as somebody who's been teaching in Medford for, you know, 24 years, teaching sixth grade, 10th grade, 12th grade, coached boys and girls, tennis to the literary magazine, created the mantra for the school, and just basically, I love going to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7213.308s">Over</a>  the past three years of the pandemic, we, and I'm sorry, I didn't wear red, I just made dinner. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7220.321s">have</a>  stepped up in, we think, unprecedented ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7222.602s">We</a>  revised the curriculum to meet the changing needs of the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7225.084s">All</a>  of us learned how to use all sorts of different new apps. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7228.006s">Some</a>  of us are not as computer savvy. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7229.467s">We're</a>  just basically going back to school for all that, and then immediately evaluated on our use of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7234.131s">We</a>  are available at all hours to help students who are struggling due to stress. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7239.535s">We</a>  were stressed too. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7240.395s">They</a>  were stressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7241.456s">We</a>  had colleagues die. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7243.516s">right,</a>  because of COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7245.197s">And</a>  we're, meanwhile, like getting on Zooms and making, you know, trying to make people feel comfortable who didn't want to show their families, you know, homes on Zoom and still being like, let's get on the Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7254.401s">And</a>  we Zoomed together, and we bought the stuff we needed, and we bought the technology to make, you know, do the best we could with hybrid learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7261.775s">Now</a>  we find ourselves working without a contract for almost a full year. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7264.937s">Find</a>  ourselves without a raise when inflation is almost 8%. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7267.159s">We</a>  find ourselves working multiple jobs to make ends meet, especially a lot of the younger teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7272.403s">You</a>  know, I'm an older teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7273.604s">So</a>  like, I'm happy, you know, in general with, I'm not, you know, I don't want to say too much because we are here to talk about the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7279.588s">Do</a>  you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7281.49s">But</a>  like, obviously the younger teachers that I'm really making enough money and many of them, like my coworkers drive Lyft, like they, you know, they leave work to go to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7291.243s">We</a>  find ourselves losing prep time. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7293.144s">I</a>  substituted today, I substitute basically one out of every, you know, two or three preps that I have, I'm basically substituting because we haven't hired enough substitute teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7302.329s">Students</a>  are wandering the hall because there's enough support staff to monitor the corridors. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7306.371s">Almost</a>  every one of my classes begins with me looking out and recognizing who I know in the audience, meaning the hallway and saying like, hey everybody, like, can we get where we're going? <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7315.276s">And</a>  that, you know, that takes away from time and it makes it seem like a less serious enterprise that we're engaged in. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7320.902s">So,</a>  you know, the general feeling is that a lot of us feel unsupported and that we feel like even the administrators we work with are so busy and hairy that they can't deal with the multiple tasks they're trying to deal with. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7333.393s">We</a>  see a lot of our colleagues approaching their work with fear, not love and joy, and just stress, stress, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7340.759s">Twice</a>  this month, teachers have gathered outside the building by the flagpole to let <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7345.848s">you</a>  know, by the Vietnam Memorial to let the community know of our struggles and to build awareness. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7351.252s">But</a>  we haven't seen the school committee members, the elected stewards, step into the building and ask the teachers what's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7356.257s">Now,</a>  I know that that is phrased in like a, you know, I like to say like, please come visit, you know, like we welcome the opportunity to speak with you about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7372.125s">You</a>  know, similarly we haven't seen people from central coming around like you know in the hallway and saying like hey kids get to class and just saying like how's it going here. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7381.112s">Not</a>  that monitoring the hallways isn't a part of the gig, it is a part of the gig, but it's still too much part of the gig and we'd like to focus more on teaching. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7389.086s">I'd</a>  like to focus at the end on just the bright note. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7391.867s">The</a>  good news, such as it is, is that none of these issues are irreparable. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7395.288s">But</a>  getting Medford back on track, supporting our teachers so that they can support the children, and making Medford a place where people want to work and live will take everybody's active engagement, real partnerships between all of us, from school committee to central administration, to building administrators, to teachers, and support staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7412.894s">active</a>  and open communication, and a real will to do right by our teachers, our students, and our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7418.844s">Signed,</a>  yours in education, the veteran teachers of the Medford Public Schools.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7436.083s">My</a>  name is Mr. Milne. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7437.944s">I</a>  had 31 of the most rewarding years of my life teaching for our school systems, and I've had many of your children. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7446.606s">And</a>  I wanna talk about something- Just address for the record, please, your address. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7450.447s">Address</a>  for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7451.248s">No,</a>  51 Quincy Street, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7453.508s">I</a>  wanna talk about something that doesn't cost you a cent. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7460.15s">It's</a>  about being nice and being appreciative. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7464.449s">And</a>  the people behind me were at work about seven o'clock this morning, working hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7471.474s">We</a>  hit the COVID iceberg. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7475.897s">We</a>  didn't want to, but it happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7479.899s">And</a>  we need to address it. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7482.761s">These</a>  people have been up since seven o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7486.143s">Many</a>  of them have to go home and prepare for tomorrow and then do it all over again tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7491.547s">Doesn't</a>  cost us a cent. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7493.757s">I</a>  propose we stand up and appreciate them. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7496.199s">Thank</a>  you to everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7508.97s">I</a>  think many of you have been reading Chris Huffaker's article in the Boston Globe. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7514.495s">And</a>  let me just point out the most chilling fact that he put in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7520.497s">44%</a>  of Massachusetts teachers have stated that they plan on leaving teaching in the next two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7531.264s">As</a>  you know, I retired in June, so I'm in this position where I have excellent contact with my colleagues, but I'm no longer working. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7540.871s">I</a>  can be confidential. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7543.874s">Do</a>  you realize how many teachers we are losing? <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7548.055s">And</a>  if you look out in this audience, one department in particular, we don't see any of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7556.677s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7557.537s">Because</a>  they're planning on leaving. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7559.057s">They've</a>  been bullied. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7560.818s">And</a>  there's been a homophobic level of it, and it hasn't been addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7564.959s">So</a>  we're making their jobs even worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7568.699s">We</a>  don't need to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7570.28s">We</a>  don't need to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7572.011s">We've</a>  got the wrong trifecta going. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7574.874s">We're</a>  overworking them. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7576.476s">How</a>  many of you non-teachers have sat down with a teacher about the existential crisis that they go through when their preparatory time is taken away? <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7589.769s">How</a>  many of you have done it? <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7592.691s">Let</a>  me walk you through it real quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7594.673s">I</a>  was a history psychology teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7597.234s">I'd</a>  go into the office in the morning and I'd be told I'm teaching a Spanish class. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7602.679s">I</a>  don't speak much Spanish, like three words. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7607.062s">Do</a>  you know how demoralizing that is to me as professional that wants to do the right thing? <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7613.287s">And</a>  then it gets worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7617.185s">I</a>  stayed up at night preparing, writing a test, or doing something, and that was my period for photocopying it. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7625.333s">I</a>  see Mr. Wildness out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7627.855s">Chemistry's</a>  not easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7629.456s">Setting</a>  up a lab is not easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7632.539s">And</a>  when that time period is taken away all of a sudden, and you have the kids read to do the lab, and then they can't do it, that's demoralizing again. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7645.703s">Okay,</a>  I have one question for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7648.644s">How</a>  are we gonna replace these people? <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7654.965s">The</a>  number one issue and the number one needs we need to meet are the children's needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7660.606s">You</a>  are gonna be in a crisis next year when your kids do not have teachers, especially in one department, which is MCAS tested. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7671.567s">You're</a>  gonna be in big trouble. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7673.108s">You</a>  are gonna get a lot of calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7676.141s">Now,</a>  let me address the elephant in the room. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7679.383s">I</a>  was a little bit disappointed in the way this meeting began. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7683.264s">These</a>  people got up at seven, have to get up at seven tomorrow again and be at work, and we're talking about corrugated pipes. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7697.051s">I</a>  have served for other mayors, other superintendents, <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7701.866s">other</a>  school committees, and that would have not have happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7704.828s">That</a>  was wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7707.21s">And</a>  the first meeting of the school year for the teachers this year, and last year on my 31 years, was the worst year teaching. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7717.078s">It</a>  was the hardest year teaching. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7720.02s">It</a>  took my soul. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7721.361s">And</a>  what was the first meeting about this year? <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7724.924s">We're</a>  gonna begin the evaluation process. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7729.841s">That</a>  was wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7731.802s">That</a>  was wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7733.342s">We</a>  can do better that in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7735.303s">We</a>  are better. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7736.684s">We</a>  have a wonderful adaptive program. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7738.885s">I</a>  got calls this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7740.265s">We</a>  have a Brazilian kid going to Harvard. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7742.886s">We</a>  have a Haitian kid who is going to Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7746.267s">We</a>  have more kids going to the prestigious schools than Winchester does. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7751.549s">And</a>  we have a vocational school that most communities don't even have and can't match. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7758.092s">We</a>  have a lot to be proud of. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7760.655s">And</a>  we can do better than we have just done. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7762.917s">We</a>  can do better. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7764.819s">We</a>  are Medford.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7773.848s">Mr.</a>  Milne, that was three minutes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7777.491s">So</a>  my last statement is, this is not the time to bottom dollar it. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7782.37s">and</a>  we're gonna have a huge exodus whether you like it or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7785.452s">They're</a>  moving into other professions and they're moving to wealthier, wider suburbs. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7792.616s">Have</a>  you ever done this? <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7793.877s">Have</a>  you ever counted how many former Medford teachers teach at Newton North? <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7799.4s">Go</a>  do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7803.762s">And</a>  many of our best and many, <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7807.62s">of</a>  our former teachers of color. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7810.181s">Everything</a>  about that equation is wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7812.943s">We</a>  can do better than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7814.424s">And</a>  it doesn't really come about money. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7818.466s">It's</a>  about appreciation. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7821.067s">How</a>  many of you had lunch with teachers? <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7823.969s">How</a>  many of you meet with them, talk with them? <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7829.852s">Please</a>  value the primary relationship <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7835.655s">of</a>  our town, which is what? <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7838.738s">Student</a>  teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7840.559s">Thank</a>  you for listening.</p>

    <p>[Began]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7865.675s">I'll</a>  say Sean being in 362 Lawrence Road, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7870.217s">So</a>  I am a parent of two children at the high school, I'll have a third child in a couple years going to the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7876.439s">And</a>  my interest in this and in all school committee matters is strictly child related and child focus. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7884.522s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7885.609s">I</a>  know the kids in this city, as they have everywhere across the country, have had just a horrendous two years, and it's not the teacher's fault. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7895.174s">It's</a>  just what we went through. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7897.796s">I</a>  don't, and I hope that this isn't going to be the next crisis that the kids have on their brains, because I know I've already started to hear, coming back to my house, the teachers aren't happy, the teachers were picketing. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7911.843s">And</a>  I'm not saying they shouldn't do that or blaming them for doing that, <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7916.147s">It's</a>  going to be another source of anxiety for these kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7920.791s">And</a>  I've heard a lot of hyperbole tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7923.933s">I've</a>  heard of some grandstanding tonight from certain people who represent union interests. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7931.298s">And</a>  I've heard, you know, about some pretty specific, I guess, negotiations. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7937.163s">And</a>  to Councilor Rousseau's point, it must be frustrating to sit there and not be able to respond, I imagine. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7945.911s">I</a>  hope that the two sides will come together very quickly and not let this get any further than it has gone tonight already. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7955.774s">And</a>  I hope some of the things that Mr. Milne saying about teachers leaving is, I hope it's exaggerated, frankly, because I really hope that doesn't happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7964.454s">Some</a>  great teachers here, and my daughters have had some great experiences in the Medford schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7969.456s">My</a>  oldest will be going to Boston College next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7972.318s">And</a>  I heard Dr. Wadness's name mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7975.279s">Lily</a>  has Dr. Wadness this year, and that's been a great class for her. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7980.341s">So</a>  I hope that maybe as we're going through these negotiations, as you're going through these negotiations tomorrow, just keep the kids in mind as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7990.697s">Clearly,</a>  this is a money issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7992.799s">Let's</a>  come to a compromise. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7994.742s">I'm</a>  sure you're not as far apart as you probably think you are. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=7997.765s">And</a>  let's make a goal to get this wrapped up very quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=8001.649s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=8164.967s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=8166.588s">In</a>  consultation with the superintendent's office, there's still some clarity we need to <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=8176.534s">get</a>  to on our agenda creation, which, you know, we did make such a huge change that doesn't surprise me. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=8183.179s">The</a>  way that I had understood report requests is that we would make the report requests, they would be new business, and then they would stay on the agenda under reports requested until satisfied. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=8195.449s">So</a>  I <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=8197.37s">believe</a>  that was the intent of the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=8200.132s">And</a>  that's why it's on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=8201.433s">It</a>  is not that there's an actual report to come back today. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=8204.176s">I</a>  just think it's important for the committee to know that that's why it's here. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=8207.959s">Because</a>  I noticed in the last meeting, it wasn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=8210.941s">And</a>  I was like, wait, well, where did that report go? <a href="https://youtu.be/UM6Hbf_Z6LM&t=8214.044s">So</a>  I just wanted to let the committee know that that was why it's appearing on the agenda tonight, even though it's not something to discuss.</p>
