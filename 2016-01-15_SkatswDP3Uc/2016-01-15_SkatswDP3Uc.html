    <p>[Carrie Anne]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SkatswDP3Uc&t=73.153s">I</a>  don't think there's any benefits of swimming though. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkatswDP3Uc&t=75.615s">Are</a>  you kidding me? <a href="https://youtu.be/SkatswDP3Uc&t=76.476s">There's</a>  tons!</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SkatswDP3Uc&t=118.488s">I'm</a>  so excited. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkatswDP3Uc&t=119.909s">You</a>  too.</p>

    <p>[Carrie Anne]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SkatswDP3Uc&t=126.232s">Hi,</a>  I'm Jocelyn McCarthy with the Muston Report. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkatswDP3Uc&t=128.353s">I'm</a>  here with Mr. Ward from the Carpentry class. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkatswDP3Uc&t=130.314s">Can</a>  you tell me a little bit about your project you guys are working on?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SkatswDP3Uc&t=133.496s">Yes,</a>  the project that we are working on now is bookcases for classrooms around Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkatswDP3Uc&t=141.201s">We</a>  were actually approached by an organization called Boston Cares about two months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkatswDP3Uc&t=147.942s">about</a>  cutting parts for projects that they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkatswDP3Uc&t=152.363s">And</a>  we actually are forming a partnership with them and the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkatswDP3Uc&t=158.585s">And</a>  this particular project are bookcases that will be assembled by a community service project on Martin Luther King Day at the Boston Latin School. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkatswDP3Uc&t=173.692s">And</a>  so they had the materials delivered, and we did all of the prepping and all of the cutting of the materials. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkatswDP3Uc&t=181.355s">And</a>  they're actually going to come pick them up tomorrow and bring them to the Boston Latin School.</p>

    <p>[Carrie Anne]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SkatswDP3Uc&t=186.376s">Do</a>  you know how many you made?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SkatswDP3Uc&t=188.257s">We</a>  had to make 50. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkatswDP3Uc&t=190.038s">And</a>  we actually started the project yesterday, cutting it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkatswDP3Uc&t=194.319s">And</a>  we finished it. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkatswDP3Uc&t=197.84s">No,</a>  we started two days ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkatswDP3Uc&t=199.121s">And</a>  we finished it yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkatswDP3Uc&t=200.621s">And</a>  they're picking them up on Friday.</p>

    <p>[Carrie Anne]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SkatswDP3Uc&t=203.432s">Mr.</a>  Ward, do you have any other projects you'll be working on?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SkatswDP3Uc&t=207.014s">Yes,</a>  as a matter of fact, the biggest project we'll be working on for Boston Cares is their toddler bed program that they have where, again, it's a community service project where <a href="https://youtu.be/SkatswDP3Uc&t=223.137s">companies</a>  send their employees and they come and volunteer to sand, assemble, paint beds and they'll do 50 to 75 beds at one time and then those beds are delivered to homeless shelters around Boston and they give them to families for their children to sleep in. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkatswDP3Uc&t=245.015s">And</a>  that was the program that they approached us for to help them with. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkatswDP3Uc&t=249.656s">And</a>  so when they come to pick up the bookcases, they're actually going to deliver us the parts of the bed. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkatswDP3Uc&t=257.817s">And</a>  then we are going to build 50 beds. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkatswDP3Uc&t=263.278s">We're</a>  forming a partnership to build 500 beds in one year. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkatswDP3Uc&t=268.779s">And</a>  we're going to be building 50, and on March 9, <a href="https://youtu.be/SkatswDP3Uc&t=273.419s">A</a>  company from Bill Ricka is going to come to our cabinet shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkatswDP3Uc&t=278.323s">Boston</a>  Cares is going to bring all of their materials and they're going to take the beds that we are building and assemble them here in our shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkatswDP3Uc&t=289.613s">And</a>  our SkillsUSA program is going to volunteer as part of their community service to help on that day. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkatswDP3Uc&t=298.636s">as</a>  well as some of the carpenters and the construction craft laborers helping people to teach them how to assemble them. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkatswDP3Uc&t=306.063s">Because</a>  these are just volunteers that come. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkatswDP3Uc&t=308.204s">They</a>  may have never done anything like this before. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkatswDP3Uc&t=310.807s">So</a>  we're going to help them assemble and paint them and get them completed because they try to build 50 beds in four hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkatswDP3Uc&t=320.555s">So</a>  it's going to be a lot of fun and we're looking forward to it.</p>

    <p>[Carrie Anne]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/SkatswDP3Uc&t=323.438s">That's</a>  awesome. <a href="https://youtu.be/SkatswDP3Uc&t=324.298s">Thank</a>  you.</p>
