1
00:00:01,485 --> 00:00:02,687
You won the Powerball!

2
00:00:02,707 --> 00:00:03,689
That's awesome!

3
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:04,731
It's so weird though.

4
00:00:04,972 --> 00:00:05,833
My numbers are letters.

5
00:00:06,274 --> 00:00:06,434
What?

6
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:30,560
Hi girls, come on in.

7
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:31,361
Oh, hi.

8
00:00:33,702 --> 00:00:36,103
We're from the high school and we have a couple questions about the pool.

9
00:00:36,663 --> 00:00:38,684
Yeah, actually my dad was wondering about the open swim.

10
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:42,126
So yeah, our open swim hours are 7 to 10 a.m.

11
00:00:42,146 --> 00:00:44,627
in the morning and 7.30 to 9 p.m.

12
00:00:44,647 --> 00:00:45,648
at night Monday through Friday.

13
00:00:46,187 --> 00:00:49,508
And then on Saturday, we're doing 8 to 2.30, and we're closed on Sundays.

14
00:00:50,169 --> 00:00:51,769
Do you have any lessons for little kids?

15
00:00:52,569 --> 00:00:59,892
As a matter of fact, our program is starting on January 16th in a couple of weeks, and it's from 8 to 12 on Saturdays, and it's for eight weeks long.

16
00:01:00,592 --> 00:01:01,273
Are you interested?

17
00:01:01,373 --> 00:01:02,113
Yeah, I want to do that.

18
00:01:02,153 --> 00:01:02,873
How do we sign up?

19
00:01:04,034 --> 00:01:05,874
You can go to the community school's office.

20
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:11,877
It's open Mondays and Tuesdays, 9 to 3, and Mondays and Thursdays, 7 to 10, and then on Saturdays from 8 to 3.

21
00:01:13,153 --> 00:01:15,235
I don't think there's any benefits of swimming though.

22
00:01:15,615 --> 00:01:16,436
Are you kidding me?

23
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:17,196
There's tons!

24
00:01:17,216 --> 00:01:18,798
Are you kidding me?

25
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:20,579
There's tons of benefits of swimming.

26
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:25,423
Come on, I'll show you.

27
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:29,786
Swimming improves the entire physique of your body and it increases circulation.

28
00:01:31,188 --> 00:01:32,569
And it builds up your endurance.

29
00:01:34,368 --> 00:01:36,690
What if you're really clumsy and have sports injuries?

30
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:39,953
We use swimming as therapy for all types of sport injuries.

31
00:01:40,353 --> 00:01:42,074
What are some of the other benefits for swimming?

32
00:01:42,615 --> 00:01:46,778
Well, it's a great cardiovascular workout and it helps you control and maintain a healthy weight.

33
00:01:46,798 --> 00:01:49,301
Do you have any information about the program?

34
00:01:49,841 --> 00:01:50,161
Of course.

35
00:01:50,241 --> 00:01:52,763
Follow me back into my office and I'll give you an informational flyer.

36
00:01:52,783 --> 00:01:54,665
Here you guys go.

37
00:01:55,205 --> 00:01:56,466
For each of you.

38
00:01:56,507 --> 00:01:57,487
Thank you so much.

39
00:01:57,547 --> 00:01:58,428
This is awesome.

40
00:01:58,488 --> 00:01:59,869
I'm so excited.

41
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:00,270
You too.

42
00:02:06,232 --> 00:02:08,253
Hi, I'm Jocelyn McCarthy with the Muston Report.

43
00:02:08,353 --> 00:02:10,194
I'm here with Mr. Ward from the Carpentry class.

44
00:02:10,314 --> 00:02:12,656
Can you tell me a little bit about your project you guys are working on?

45
00:02:13,496 --> 00:02:20,680
Yes, the project that we are working on now is bookcases for classrooms around Boston.

46
00:02:21,201 --> 00:02:26,904
We were actually approached by an organization called Boston Cares about two months ago.

47
00:02:27,942 --> 00:02:31,423
about cutting parts for projects that they have.

48
00:02:32,363 --> 00:02:37,545
And we actually are forming a partnership with them and the vocational school.

49
00:02:38,585 --> 00:02:52,770
And this particular project are bookcases that will be assembled by a community service project on Martin Luther King Day at the Boston Latin School.

50
00:02:53,692 --> 00:03:01,195
And so they had the materials delivered, and we did all of the prepping and all of the cutting of the materials.

51
00:03:01,355 --> 00:03:05,756
And they're actually going to come pick them up tomorrow and bring them to the Boston Latin School.

52
00:03:06,376 --> 00:03:07,597
Do you know how many you made?

53
00:03:08,257 --> 00:03:08,837
We had to make 50.

54
00:03:10,038 --> 00:03:14,139
And we actually started the project yesterday, cutting it out.

55
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,320
And we finished it.

56
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,101
No, we started two days ago.

57
00:03:19,121 --> 00:03:20,541
And we finished it yesterday.

58
00:03:20,621 --> 00:03:22,342
And they're picking them up on Friday.

59
00:03:23,432 --> 00:03:25,854
Mr. Ward, do you have any other projects you'll be working on?

60
00:03:27,014 --> 00:03:41,364
Yes, as a matter of fact, the biggest project we'll be working on for Boston Cares is their toddler bed program that they have where, again, it's a community service project where

61
00:03:43,137 --> 00:04:04,034
companies send their employees and they come and volunteer to sand, assemble, paint beds and they'll do 50 to 75 beds at one time and then those beds are delivered to homeless shelters around Boston and they give them to families for their children to sleep in.

62
00:04:05,015 --> 00:04:09,556
And that was the program that they approached us for to help them with.

63
00:04:09,656 --> 00:04:17,177
And so when they come to pick up the bookcases, they're actually going to deliver us the parts of the bed.

64
00:04:17,817 --> 00:04:22,678
And then we are going to build 50 beds.

65
00:04:23,278 --> 00:04:27,799
We're forming a partnership to build 500 beds in one year.

66
00:04:28,779 --> 00:04:31,360
And we're going to be building 50, and on March 9,

67
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:37,582
A company from Bill Ricka is going to come to our cabinet shop.

68
00:04:38,323 --> 00:04:48,652
Boston Cares is going to bring all of their materials and they're going to take the beds that we are building and assemble them here in our shop.

69
00:04:49,613 --> 00:04:57,900
And our SkillsUSA program is going to volunteer as part of their community service to help on that day.

70
00:04:58,636 --> 00:05:05,862
as well as some of the carpenters and the construction craft laborers helping people to teach them how to assemble them.

71
00:05:06,063 --> 00:05:08,144
Because these are just volunteers that come.

72
00:05:08,204 --> 00:05:10,366
They may have never done anything like this before.

73
00:05:10,807 --> 00:05:20,015
So we're going to help them assemble and paint them and get them completed because they try to build 50 beds in four hours.

74
00:05:20,555 --> 00:05:22,817
So it's going to be a lot of fun and we're looking forward to it.

75
00:05:23,438 --> 00:05:23,958
That's awesome.

76
00:05:24,298 --> 00:05:24,599
Thank you.

77
00:05:26,024 --> 00:05:26,706
money money
