1
00:00:00,307 --> 00:00:01,488
Okay, good evening, everyone.

2
00:00:02,069 --> 00:00:03,149
My name's Andre LaRue.

3
00:00:03,209 --> 00:00:05,772
I'm the chair of the Medford Community Development Board.

4
00:00:06,392 --> 00:00:09,014
I'm opening our meeting for August 20th, 2020.

5
00:00:10,696 --> 00:00:17,601
The Medford Community Development Board will conduct a meeting via Zoom remote video conferencing on Thursday, August 20th, 2020 at 6 p.m.

6
00:00:20,704 --> 00:00:25,268
Pursuant to Governor Baker's March 12th, 2020 order suspending certain provisions of the open meeting law,

7
00:00:26,076 --> 00:00:34,343
general law chapter 30 A section 18 and the governor's March 15th 2020 order imposing strict limitation on the number of people that may gather in one place.

8
00:00:34,903 --> 00:00:40,367

And if you are not a board member, please state your name and address for the record.

20
00:02:17,188 --> 00:02:23,853
One moment.

21
00:02:29,853 --> 00:02:47,643
Okay, first item on the agenda is, I will also say that our last two meetings, if anyone has participated in those, were a very long meeting, so I'm going to try to do my best to move things along more expeditiously, and I would ask for everyone's help in doing so.

22
00:02:47,823 --> 00:02:50,585
Keep your comments as concise as possible.

23
00:02:53,226 --> 00:02:53,887
First, we

24
00:02:55,598 --> 00:03:01,342
move to approve the minutes of the meetings for both June 18th, 2020, as well as July 16th, 2020.

25
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:09,667
For June 18th, 2020, do board members have any questions, comments, or edits?

26
00:03:14,771 --> 00:03:15,551
Andre, this is Dave.

27
00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:17,012
I don't have any comments.

28
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:19,774
I've read them, and I wanted to make a motion to approve the minutes.

29
00:03:20,454 --> 00:03:22,956
If I can for both meetings in one motion, that's fine.

30
00:03:23,016 --> 00:03:24,197
If not, we can do it separately.

31
00:03:25,046 --> 00:03:29,107
Let's do one at a time in case there are comments on the July minutes.

32
00:03:29,647 --> 00:03:32,548
There's a motion on the floor to approve the minutes for June.

33
00:03:33,188 --> 00:03:33,768
Is there a second?

34
00:03:36,148 --> 00:03:36,649
I'll second.

35
00:03:36,689 --> 00:03:37,309
This is Deanna.

36
00:03:38,109 --> 00:03:41,049
Thanks, Deanna.

37
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:49,571
With virtual meeting, we will do a... Just mute if you're not speaking.

38
00:03:51,212 --> 00:03:51,552
Thank you.

39
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:52,792
There's some feedback there.

40
00:03:55,678 --> 00:03:56,858
So the roll call vote.

41
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:58,139
Deanna Peabody?

42
00:04:01,701 --> 00:04:01,841
Aye.

43
00:04:04,023 --> 00:04:04,643
Christy Dowd?

44
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:05,884
Aye.

45
00:04:06,985 --> 00:04:07,805
Cless Andresen?

46
00:04:08,886 --> 00:04:09,006
Aye.

47
00:04:11,187 --> 00:04:11,988
Jackie Furtado?

48
00:04:12,768 --> 00:04:12,948
Aye.

49
00:04:14,449 --> 00:04:15,270
And David Blumberg?

50
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:16,110
Aye.

51
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,731
All right, thank you.

52
00:04:17,871 --> 00:04:18,832
And I'm an aye as well.

53
00:04:18,852 --> 00:04:20,793
6-0, motion passes.

54
00:04:23,182 --> 00:04:26,223
Any questions, comments, or edits for the July minutes?

55
00:04:28,525 --> 00:04:29,925
Seeing none, is there a motion on the floor?

56
00:04:31,566 --> 00:04:32,526
Andre, this is Dave again.

57
00:04:32,587 --> 00:04:36,288
I'll take that as well, a motion to approve the minutes from our July meeting.

58
00:04:36,989 --> 00:04:37,209
Great.

59
00:04:37,429 --> 00:04:38,009
Thank you, David.

60
00:04:38,029 --> 00:04:38,789
Is there a second?

61
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:39,550
Second.

62
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,690
This is Jackie Furtado.

63
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,111
I second that motion.

64
00:04:42,831 --> 00:04:43,592
Thank you, Jackie.

65
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:45,172
Roll call vote.

66
00:04:45,513 --> 00:04:46,153
Deanna Peabody?

67
00:04:46,973 --> 00:04:47,073
Aye.

68
00:04:48,494 --> 00:04:49,034
Christy Dowd?

69
00:04:50,455 --> 00:04:50,615
Aye.

70
00:04:51,756 --> 00:04:52,456
Klaas Andreassen?

71
00:04:55,133 --> 00:04:55,914
Jackie Furtado.

72
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:56,954
Aye.

73
00:04:57,715 --> 00:04:58,375
David Blumberg.

74
00:04:59,096 --> 00:04:59,236
Aye.

75
00:04:59,956 --> 00:05:00,857
And I'm an aye as well.

76
00:05:00,877 --> 00:05:02,298
6-0, the motion passes.

77
00:05:02,338 --> 00:05:02,678
Thank you.

78
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:09,102
Next item on the agenda, we have an A in our plan.

79
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:16,427
It's also, for the members of the public, an approval not required plan for review at 73 to 79 George Street.

80
00:05:17,087 --> 00:05:23,371
So the applicant here owns two adjacent lots along George Street and is proposing to create three lots, each one

81
00:05:24,004 --> 00:05:29,208
5,000 square feet in size, with 50 feet of frontage along George Street.

82
00:05:30,969 --> 00:05:46,081
With A&Rs, board members know, members of the public may not know, A&R stands for approval not required, and that's exactly what this is, and the board must approve as long as it meets the minimum zoning requirements.

83
00:05:46,841 --> 00:05:51,985
The lots appear to do so, they've been reviewed by the city engineer,

84
00:05:52,713 --> 00:05:59,379
and building commissioner and that they're satisfied with the requirements.

85
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,643
Board members, you have the chance to take a look at the materials.

86
00:06:04,444 --> 00:06:06,746
Any questions that you might have?

87
00:06:10,609 --> 00:06:13,932
Seeing none, is there a motion to approve the A&R plan?

88
00:06:23,204 --> 00:06:24,944
Hi, this is Christy Dowd.

89
00:06:25,064 --> 00:06:27,705
I'll make a motion to approve the A&R plan.

90
00:06:27,725 --> 00:06:29,345
All right, thank you.

91
00:06:29,365 --> 00:06:34,546
There's a motion to approve the A&R plan for 73 to 79 George Street.

92
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:39,907
And Andre, I just want to correct the record there that the building commissioner reviewed this, not the city engineer.

93
00:06:40,047 --> 00:06:41,547
Yes, I misspoke at first.

94
00:06:41,647 --> 00:06:41,967
Thank you.

95
00:06:45,448 --> 00:06:46,568
Is there a second to the motion?

96
00:06:47,348 --> 00:06:48,049
Andre, this is Dave.

97
00:06:48,069 --> 00:06:48,869
I'll second the motion.

98
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:50,389
All right, thank you, David.

99
00:06:51,632 --> 00:06:52,353
Roll call vote.

100
00:06:52,733 --> 00:06:53,353
Deanna Peabody.

101
00:06:54,193 --> 00:06:54,293
Aye.

102
00:06:55,894 --> 00:06:56,454
Christy Dowd.

103
00:06:57,214 --> 00:06:57,374
Aye.

104
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:58,615
Les Andresen.

105
00:06:59,996 --> 00:07:00,116
Aye.

106
00:07:00,816 --> 00:07:01,596
Jackie Furtado.

107
00:07:02,316 --> 00:07:02,497
Aye.

108
00:07:02,897 --> 00:07:03,537
David Blumberg.

109
00:07:04,297 --> 00:07:04,417
Aye.

110
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:05,778
And I'm an aye as well.

111
00:07:05,798 --> 00:07:09,139
6-0, the ANR plan is approved for endorsement.

112
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:14,401
And board members, now that City Hall is open,

113
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:21,031
We will make arrangements so that you can come by to sign the plan.

114
00:07:21,091 --> 00:07:24,193
We'll have it in the Office of Community Development.

115
00:07:25,794 --> 00:07:26,575
Thank you, everybody.

116
00:07:26,755 --> 00:07:28,636
And thank you to the proponents.

117
00:07:30,557 --> 00:07:34,359
Thank you.

118
00:07:34,499 --> 00:07:39,302
Next item on the agenda is a continued public hearing for 278 Middlesex Ave.

119
00:07:39,342 --> 00:07:43,085
This is the proposed gas station at the BJ's lot.

120
00:07:44,927 --> 00:07:49,552
continued from June 18th, 2020, as well as July 16th, 2020.

121
00:07:50,293 --> 00:07:54,838
The Community Development Board is the special permit granting authority for this project.

122
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:00,985
So let me reread the public hearing notice.

123
00:08:04,048 --> 00:08:04,469
One moment.

124
00:08:07,468 --> 00:08:08,949
Andre, this is Christy Dowd.

125
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:18,835
I'm not sure if I should do this before you read the notice, but I did want to disclose that I work for Stantec.

126
00:08:19,175 --> 00:08:28,100
And I just learned since the last board meeting that Stantec has been hired by BJ's to provide environmental consulting.

127
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:34,704
So with that new information, I am going to abstain from reviewing this project.

128
00:08:35,965 --> 00:08:38,866
and participating any further in this review.

129
00:08:39,446 --> 00:08:46,309
So I am going to mute and stop my video for this portion of the agenda.

130
00:08:46,329 --> 00:08:51,651
Okay, thank you, Christy, appreciate that.

131
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:57,653
Public hearing notice that was first opened on June 18th, 2020 of the Community Development Board.

132
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:02,071
The Medford Community Development Board shall conduct a public hearing on Thursday, June 18, 2020.

133
00:09:02,591 --> 00:09:08,152
That was continued into July and to today at 6.45 p.m.

134
00:09:08,192 --> 00:09:25,055
via Zoom remote video conferencing relative to a special permit site plan review application submitted by BJ's Wholesale Club to construct a self-service fueling station within a portion of the existing parking area 278 and 0 Middlesex Avenue and allowed use in an industrial zoning district.

135
00:09:25,569 --> 00:09:31,712
The site is currently occupied by an existing BJ's Wholesale Club with associated surface parking and site improvements.

136
00:09:32,212 --> 00:09:46,339
The proposed facility will be comprised of a 200 more or less square foot kiosk gasoline attendant facility with canopy of 4,525 square feet and a six dispenser service pump island.

137
00:09:46,779 --> 00:09:52,322
A copy of the application may be viewed in the office of community development room 308 or on the city's website at

138
00:09:53,609 --> 00:10:03,354
www.medfordma.org backslash departments backslash community hyphen development by clicking on current CD board filings.

139
00:10:04,814 --> 00:10:20,021
This time I reopen the public hearing and I would like to invite the proponents to present their revised materials and speak to their progress since our last meeting.

140
00:10:22,138 --> 00:10:22,920
Uh, yes.

141
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:26,325
Good evening, Mr Chairman and members of the board for the record.

142
00:10:26,385 --> 00:10:31,254
Attorney Mark Vaughn with the law firm of Riemer Bronstein, representing the applicant BJ's.

143
00:10:32,543 --> 00:10:33,544
a few folks with us tonight.

144
00:10:33,824 --> 00:10:37,506
Could I just, before making any presentation, could I just ask a procedural question?

145
00:10:40,268 --> 00:10:46,872
I know you have a seven-member board, and I understand a board member is elected to recuse herself.

146
00:10:47,132 --> 00:10:51,135
Are the remaining six members present?

147
00:10:51,335 --> 00:10:52,475
I didn't know if you were...

148
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:56,471
How many board members you have?

149
00:10:56,951 --> 00:10:59,653
The reason I ask is I know there's a special permit.

150
00:11:00,113 --> 00:11:07,937
So therefore, I believe we would need the quantum of vote would be five out of the remaining six.

151
00:11:08,037 --> 00:11:08,598
Is that correct?

152
00:11:08,858 --> 00:11:16,662
So I just wanted to just understand if you only had five that would be present or?

153
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:23,206
Yes, there'd be five voting board members at this time.

154
00:11:25,253 --> 00:11:28,236
Okay, so one member is absent this evening?

155
00:11:28,656 --> 00:11:28,876
Yes.

156
00:11:29,417 --> 00:11:29,717
Okay.

157
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:50,315
So, I guess I'm just wondering whether it would behoove us to continue the hearing if the board were willing just, I know this is all happening in real time right now, but since we wouldn't have a full board and

158
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:54,458
already lost one board member.

159
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:01,600
Just thinking that that might be appropriate in this instance.

160
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:10,603
Otherwise, we would likely need to have a unanimous vote of all five.

161
00:12:11,304 --> 00:12:12,524
Yeah.

162
00:12:13,224 --> 00:12:13,404
Right.

163
00:12:13,905 --> 00:12:15,645
Understood.

164
00:12:16,065 --> 00:12:18,346
And that is, we're happy to do so.

165
00:12:18,826 --> 00:12:20,367
If you'd like to request that at the

166
00:12:21,463 --> 00:12:33,707
If you would also like to take the advantage of the time that we're all here to present your revisions and progress, we could also do that before continuing.

167
00:12:35,047 --> 00:12:41,809
Might be helpful to see if we've gotten the issues that were raised addressed.

168
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:42,810
Okay.

169
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:48,972
With the understanding that the board member not participating tonight would be able to

170
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,441
watch a tape of the hearing to be able to participate at the next meeting?

171
00:12:54,981 --> 00:12:55,181
Yes.

172
00:12:56,081 --> 00:12:56,221
OK.

173
00:12:56,281 --> 00:12:59,562
Because I think everyone's been at each of the prior two meetings, correct?

174
00:13:00,062 --> 00:13:00,242
Yes.

175
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:01,002
Yeah.

176
00:13:01,303 --> 00:13:01,563
OK.

177
00:13:03,903 --> 00:13:07,344
So I guess I would, I know we have my client.

178
00:13:08,544 --> 00:13:13,906
If we were there in real person, I would look over at my client and just confirm that that's acceptable.

179
00:13:13,946 --> 00:13:17,827
But I think that's appropriate to

180
00:13:21,276 --> 00:13:30,621
go forward, but I don't know, Patrick, do you, or Austin, just would like to get their input.

181
00:13:32,022 --> 00:13:34,664
Annie, can you unmute Patrick?

182
00:13:40,007 --> 00:13:41,368
I think you're unmuted now, Patrick.

183
00:13:43,449 --> 00:13:45,190
Somehow you're still muted on your end.

184
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:46,291
We can't hear you talking.

185
00:13:46,931 --> 00:13:47,491
Thank you very much.

186
00:13:47,511 --> 00:13:50,333
There's too many mute buttons in the Zoom life that we all live.

187
00:13:51,828 --> 00:13:59,572
That is fine, Mr. Chairman, with the understanding that Mark outlined in terms of the individual who is absent being able to participate in the next hearing.

188
00:13:59,592 --> 00:14:05,796
We're happy to go through what we've put together for you tonight, and we can take it from there.

189
00:14:06,016 --> 00:14:06,496
So yes, sir.

190
00:14:06,556 --> 00:14:06,856
Thank you.

191
00:14:08,037 --> 00:14:08,257
Thank you.

192
00:14:10,192 --> 00:14:29,688
I just want to sort of comment procedurally that Annie and I just discussed that we actually haven't had it happen in her memory for a Community Development Board, but I will state that our Conservation Commission and Zoning Board have both felt that somebody could read up on the minutes and come up to speed on a meeting.

193
00:14:30,108 --> 00:14:40,797
And now that these are being recorded, it seems obvious that they could watch the recording and actually fully come up to speed on everything that transpired at the meeting.

194
00:14:41,698 --> 00:14:47,143
Yes, and I think that's what Attorney Vaughn would like the board member to do, and we'll make sure that happens.

195
00:14:51,066 --> 00:14:56,090
Okay, is there any question that that can't happen with the Community Development Board?

196
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:56,150
No.

197
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:07,695
Okay, so sorry for all the procedural questions here, but so now I guess to the substance.

198
00:15:07,715 --> 00:15:11,958
So I don't have much to say, Mr. Chairman, you'd probably be pleased to hear that.

199
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:18,503
I think that we did submit some revised materials a couple of weeks ago to the board.

200
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:23,307
Again, I think everyone here is familiar with the project.

201
00:15:23,427 --> 00:15:30,033
It's a retail gasoline station that BJ's is looking to provide within its parking lot.

202
00:15:31,093 --> 00:15:44,125
We have shown that, you know, the parking supply would be more than adequately met from a zoning in a practical perspective even with this utilization of a portion of that parking lot for this use.

203
00:15:44,726 --> 00:15:54,034
There were some questions that had come up at the prior meeting or meetings that we had that we have tried to incorporate all of that feedback and

204
00:15:54,414 --> 00:15:56,415
and put it into the revised plan.

205
00:15:56,435 --> 00:16:07,339
I think what I was going to do was ask Austin Turner, who is with Bowler Engineering, to present to the board what changes we have made.

206
00:16:07,359 --> 00:16:14,961
And I guess the only thing I would mention is, so again, to remind the board, the project is under zoning.

207
00:16:15,021 --> 00:16:15,982
It's allowed by right.

208
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:18,483
So the use itself is a by right use.

209
00:16:19,023 --> 00:16:21,964
But as a major project, quote unquote, it does require

210
00:16:22,844 --> 00:16:28,427
a special permit with site plan approval by the Community Development Board, which is why we're here.

211
00:16:28,507 --> 00:16:36,771
But I think the use is very much consistent with the surroundings in terms of what's in and around that area.

212
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:45,276
I hope the one thing that does come across is that we have tried to be very attentive and responsive to the feedback that we've received.

213
00:16:45,336 --> 00:16:47,197
And I think it's made for a better plan.

214
00:16:48,902 --> 00:16:55,388
as opposed to being repetitive here, I will turn it over to Austin and he can walk you through that if that's okay.

215
00:16:55,408 --> 00:16:55,688
Thanks.

216
00:17:01,993 --> 00:17:03,575
Hold on a moment while we get you unmuted.

217
00:17:03,775 --> 00:17:04,195
There you go.

218
00:17:05,597 --> 00:17:06,217
Good evening.

219
00:17:06,237 --> 00:17:10,121
Annie, thank you for allowing me the pleasure of my voice in the virtual world.

220
00:17:12,444 --> 00:17:20,990
So as Mr. Vaughn mentioned, we've made a number of updates based on all the feedback that we've received from these hearings.

221
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:22,351
And frankly, they've been very productive.

222
00:17:22,651 --> 00:17:26,294
And I think you'll see that the site plan has been improved as a result.

223
00:17:26,374 --> 00:17:30,397
So I'm gonna share my screen if that's possible.

224
00:17:30,417 --> 00:17:34,600
And I will show you what we're doing here.

225
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:39,624
Can everybody see that okay?

226
00:17:43,121 --> 00:17:44,562
It says you've started screen sharing.

227
00:17:44,843 --> 00:17:45,343
Oh, there it is.

228
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:45,683
Yep.

229
00:17:46,264 --> 00:17:46,664
Come up now.

230
00:17:47,325 --> 00:17:52,069
So I've got what you're looking at here is an overview of the property.

231
00:17:52,109 --> 00:17:56,113
I'll give you kind of a big picture, and then I'll dial into some of the specifics.

232
00:17:56,213 --> 00:18:03,580
But we've made a number of different site plan updates and improvements resulting from these conversations, as I had mentioned.

233
00:18:04,691 --> 00:18:15,300
As you can see, we're introducing some changes and some improvements to other portions of the site which aren't directly related to this specific set of improvements associated with the fueling station.

234
00:18:16,221 --> 00:18:20,284
One of the most significant, and I believe, I'm just gonna zoom in here.

235
00:18:22,086 --> 00:18:32,275
So I believe it was member Blumberg who mentioned the queuing and there were some questions about how that functioned and specifically,

236
00:18:33,918 --> 00:18:43,809
asked some questions about how we had it, if you recall, an intersection, if you can see my cursor circling, we'd had an intersection there, which was going to be a two-way traffic intersection.

237
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:54,440
And he had expressed some feedback, some candidly very, very good feedback that we've incorporated in response to that, we've made an improvement to the site plan.

238
00:18:55,101 --> 00:18:55,982
So what we've done

239
00:18:56,662 --> 00:19:00,584
is this driveway here that I'm pointing to was originally a two-way access drive.

240
00:19:00,784 --> 00:19:03,125
It could accommodate inbound and outbound vehicles.

241
00:19:04,026 --> 00:19:06,927
We've eliminated the outbound movement from this driveway.

242
00:19:06,987 --> 00:19:08,528
It is an in only now.

243
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:23,696
And really what that does is it further exaggerates the queuing and the vehicle flow through the fueling station that was already as part of the plan, but it reinforces the one-way circulation pattern.

244
00:19:24,715 --> 00:19:35,920
And you can see here as the fueling station is arranged, vehicles come in, move to the right, and then can filter into any number, any one of the fueling positions of which there are 12.

245
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:47,505
There are six pumps and 12 fueling positions, which really is intended to benefit the customer, provide for an efficient fueling operation where you don't get queuing or stacking at pumps.

246
00:19:48,626 --> 00:19:52,747
Now that proceeds in a counterclockwise fashion.

247
00:19:52,787 --> 00:19:54,168
So as you come through, you take a left,

248
00:19:54,672 --> 00:19:55,953
again, in a one-way driveway.

249
00:19:56,814 --> 00:20:02,759
In the previous version, you would be able to come out, take that immediate left again, come out, and then exit.

250
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:10,967
Now, as was expressed, there was some concern about this intersection becoming a little bit cumbersome or perhaps having conflicting movements.

251
00:20:12,008 --> 00:20:14,970
In response to that, we've closed it off.

252
00:20:15,877 --> 00:20:18,839
And really, we put in a very, very large landscaping island.

253
00:20:18,859 --> 00:20:35,528
So that has the benefit also of further defining and reinforcing the intended queuing and vehicular travel movements, but also provides a fairly substantial additional landscape on where we've all seen and we were talking about earlier, did not exist in this parking lot before.

254
00:20:35,628 --> 00:20:40,771
So there's an added benefit beyond just simply the vehicle flow movement.

255
00:20:41,571 --> 00:20:44,413
So that was a substantial upgrade that was made.

256
00:20:46,705 --> 00:20:51,591
You can see we've added and continued to maintain the sidewalk.

257
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:56,438
So we are maintaining and incorporating the pedestrian connectivity from Middlesex Avenue.

258
00:20:57,379 --> 00:21:01,304
We heard some feedback about that not being

259
00:21:02,869 --> 00:21:04,670
as pedestrian friendly necessarily.

260
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:16,457
So what we've done is we've introduced a landscaping strip in front of that sidewalk to provide some additional buffering from the parking in the drive aisles to that sidewalk, and that will be planted as well.

261
00:21:16,597 --> 00:21:20,039
So you get some buffer both from a landscaping perspective, it also puts the

262
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:25,101
sidewalk a bit further separated from vehicular traffic movements.

263
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:32,284
As has been previously discussed, our limit of work for this project remains entirely within the paved surface that exists today.

264
00:21:32,364 --> 00:21:37,426
So that sidewalk would not extend beyond the curbing that is out there today.

265
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:46,510
With respect to the front door here at the entrance, as you recall, there was a significant amount of discussion

266
00:21:47,586 --> 00:21:51,227
related to the driveway, trying to improve the geometry.

267
00:21:51,247 --> 00:21:55,349
So we're reconstructing the sidewalk along the project frontage.

268
00:21:55,609 --> 00:22:00,030
We're improving the accessibility features there and bringing that in conformance with current standards.

269
00:22:02,491 --> 00:22:05,732
And then internal to the parking lot and on the perimeter of the parking lot,

270
00:22:06,584 --> 00:22:10,607
what we're doing here is adding a number of different landscaping features.

271
00:22:10,667 --> 00:22:21,314
I think the most substantial and beneficial of which is going to be some significant improvements to the boundary of the property between Woodruff Avenue.

272
00:22:22,275 --> 00:22:23,756
Everybody I'm sure is familiar with this.

273
00:22:24,516 --> 00:22:27,538
Vegetation that's out there doesn't appear to be thriving.

274
00:22:27,558 --> 00:22:29,760
In fact, some of it appears to be dead, frankly.

275
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,082
And where a buffer may have existed once upon a time ago,

276
00:22:34,124 --> 00:22:35,285
we're going to reestablish that.

277
00:22:35,345 --> 00:22:47,091
So we're putting a number of different plantings in here to create a dense vegetated screen on the outside of the fence, which is still on the property that is retained and is part of the beach haze program.

278
00:22:47,492 --> 00:22:54,596
But not only will it screen the fence, it's going to create a nice vegetative buffer between Woodruff Avenue and the property.

279
00:22:58,038 --> 00:22:59,939
What's also shown on here, and

280
00:23:00,483 --> 00:23:05,365
I'm going to turn this over to Sean Kelly from Vanoss in a few minutes.

281
00:23:06,666 --> 00:23:15,669
The applicant is committing to the inclusion of approximately 1,300 feet of improvements to Middlesex Avenue related to the inclusion of bike lanes.

282
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:20,611
We had heard a lot of discussion about this.

283
00:23:20,811 --> 00:23:26,834
And I think one of the words that we heard at our last discussion was holistic.

284
00:23:27,394 --> 00:23:29,355
And we had taken that to heart.

285
00:23:31,075 --> 00:23:55,248
not only are we making some substantial improvements here on the property, which are going to have a benefit to the community, including the enhanced pedestrian connectivity, the screening improvements, but something that has resonated with us and has been discussed at length, both with the board and the technical professionals who are involved in this project were improvements to Middlesex Avenue and the

286
00:23:56,029 --> 00:23:59,810
you know, community's desire to try and improve this corridor.

287
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:03,831
So Sean's going to speak to you in a second, and I'll keep my screen up when he does.

288
00:24:03,891 --> 00:24:07,152
I have an exhibit on my screen, which is going to show the extent of those improvements.

289
00:24:07,852 --> 00:24:16,635
But this is approximately 1,300 feet of offsite improvements that the applicant is agreeing to implement, provided DOT, of course, is comfortable with those improvements.

290
00:24:17,867 --> 00:24:28,955
And it's really providing a substantial link in the proverbial chain, if you will, of the corridor improvements that we know the city has been working on for a long time.

291
00:24:29,035 --> 00:24:34,258
So we think that's a pretty significant benefit and something that we're excited about.

292
00:24:34,899 --> 00:24:39,221
I know Mr. Netriba has also been working very, very closely

293
00:24:40,202 --> 00:24:51,905
with the owner of the property, with his counterparts at BJ's with respect to some potential other improvements related to electrical vehicle parking.

294
00:24:52,666 --> 00:25:00,348
I think he's come to an agreement there and I'd love for him to have an opportunity to talk about some of the things that he's been able to accomplish there.

295
00:25:05,049 --> 00:25:07,690
And if you could unmute Patrick for a moment, please.

296
00:25:17,836 --> 00:25:18,217
There we go.

297
00:25:18,237 --> 00:25:20,902
I think I'm back on there.

298
00:25:20,942 --> 00:25:21,583
Thank you, Austin.

299
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:22,364
I appreciate that.

300
00:25:23,426 --> 00:25:30,720
Yes, in consideration of the things that we heard from various members of the board at our last hearing, we've

301
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:44,867
made an arrangement with a charging company to offer EV charging at this site, whereby we will have several stalls for folks to come and charge their cars.

302
00:25:45,527 --> 00:25:50,050
We're working out the details with that entity right now, but we would like to add that here.

303
00:25:50,731 --> 00:25:52,452
And we think that will be a real good

304
00:25:53,645 --> 00:25:58,969
a good benefit to the community and something that'll really make Club No.

305
00:25:58,989 --> 00:26:00,750
1 here for BJ's in Medford shine.

306
00:26:00,971 --> 00:26:12,500
And like we said at the beginning, that's something that we take a lot of pride in and we want to make sure that this is as close to a flagship store as we could make it, given the fact that it's 30-something years old.

307
00:26:14,241 --> 00:26:19,905
But with that being said, Austin, I'll turn it back over to you for the rest of the details.

308
00:26:21,507 --> 00:26:21,967
Thanks, Patrick.

309
00:26:23,067 --> 00:26:45,018
So before I flip it over to Sean Kelly to talk about some of the specifics relative to the bike lane improvements and some of the additional analysis that he's done in response to some of the feedback that we received at the last hearing, I'd like to ask the board if there's any specific questions or thoughts you'd like me to address immediately with respect to some of the things I just talked about.

310
00:26:52,997 --> 00:26:56,580
Hearing none, should we flip it over to Mr. Kelly to talk about some of the traffic items?

311
00:26:59,142 --> 00:27:03,485
I don't know, Andre, if it makes sense to talk now or to wait till the end for overall comments.

312
00:27:03,925 --> 00:27:09,109
Yeah, why don't we wait till the end of the presentation, and then we'll take some board member questions and comments.

313
00:27:09,129 --> 00:27:11,951
We're going to have a curtailed process tonight anyways.

314
00:27:12,832 --> 00:27:13,913
OK.

315
00:27:14,153 --> 00:27:20,498
So I don't know if you already have, but Sean Kelly is probably eagerly awaiting the power of the unmute button.

316
00:27:22,537 --> 00:27:26,819
I think I'm muted, if you guys can hear me.

317
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,221
Good evening, Mr. Chairman, members of the board.

318
00:27:29,441 --> 00:27:31,562
Again, Sean Kelley with Van Assen Associates.

319
00:27:32,882 --> 00:27:40,987
So I think the first thing I'd like to speak to tonight is a plan that we put together in response to comments we received from the city's Traffic Engineering Department.

320
00:27:41,849 --> 00:27:51,322
It's a plan to provide bicycle lanes or shared bicycle vehicular accommodations along Middlesex Avenue.

321
00:27:54,366 --> 00:27:57,390
If you can see the plan here, is my cursor active, Austin?

322
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:04,632
I have control over the screen, but if you want to share the screen, you can, John.

323
00:28:04,672 --> 00:28:05,032
No problem.

324
00:28:05,472 --> 00:28:12,854
So basically the plan, and we worked with Todd Blake from your engineering department to get some feedback as to what he was looking for.

325
00:28:13,394 --> 00:28:19,696
And the plan essentially, as you can see, is from the city line to the north to have a buffered bicycle lane.

326
00:28:20,576 --> 00:28:31,443
exclusive lanes with the painted, you know, buffered area that would extend to 1st Street and then from 1st Street down to 5th Street, do a share road accommodation.

327
00:28:32,224 --> 00:28:39,589
And, you know, we've agreed that as long as DOT is on board with these, you know, these provisions, we're more than happy to provide them.

328
00:28:43,219 --> 00:28:48,305
So I think, you know, we'll advance the design as part of our highway access permit application.

329
00:28:48,325 --> 00:28:55,373
And if they're on board, we'll, you know, we'll certainly look to implement this measure and, you know, fund it.

330
00:28:56,254 --> 00:29:02,782
The other, I guess there was also some discussion, you know, at the last meeting, there were some concerns that were raised by

331
00:29:04,153 --> 00:29:12,176
the opponents of the project relative to the traffic engineering and how we came up with our projections for traffic flows and what have you.

332
00:29:13,217 --> 00:29:15,558
We have since then gone out and done some counts.

333
00:29:17,178 --> 00:29:21,440
Went out to an existing facility in Stoneman, Massachusetts and did some counts during the morning peak.

334
00:29:22,432 --> 00:29:32,662
during the evening peak, during the Saturday midday peak, because ultimately we wanted to get a handle as to what the actual traffic at these BJ's facilities, you know, ultimately perform.

335
00:29:33,403 --> 00:29:37,707
What we found was that the morning traffic was actually lower than what we projected.

336
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:39,529
It was quite a bit lower.

337
00:29:39,549 --> 00:29:42,171
It was about 30 customers an hour.

338
00:29:43,103 --> 00:29:50,111
The evening projections were almost dead on within three to five cars, customer trips.

339
00:29:50,612 --> 00:29:52,574
And then Saturday was a little higher.

340
00:29:53,234 --> 00:29:56,678
It was in the order of about 50 cars, 50 customers per hour higher.

341
00:29:58,821 --> 00:30:01,844
We've gone through and redone the analysis, calibrated all.

342
00:30:02,944 --> 00:30:07,026
works with the higher customer traffic and ultimately didn't change the findings of the study.

343
00:30:08,226 --> 00:30:24,194
But ultimately, I think that the important thing is that the data we collected in Stoneham showed that the traffic generation rejections were accurate, that the internal capture particularly in terms of how much was coming from customers that were already at BJ's was accurate.

344
00:30:24,214 --> 00:30:25,174
It was in the 45 to 55% range.

345
00:30:28,301 --> 00:30:40,387
And ultimately, even though Saturday was a bit higher, we rerun those analyses and it shows that the final analysis is still valid, the impacts are minimal.

346
00:30:41,568 --> 00:30:51,432
So in terms of traffic, I think that's really the thrust of it tonight is that we've responded to the city's comments relative to the improvements on Middlesex Avenue.

347
00:30:51,472 --> 00:30:56,975
And then we've looked at the traffic generation at similar sites and it's confirmed the findings of the initial study.

348
00:30:58,188 --> 00:31:00,733
I'm happy to answer any questions anyone has.

349
00:31:01,975 --> 00:31:02,275
Thank you.

350
00:31:03,397 --> 00:31:04,198
Thank you, Mr. Kelly.

351
00:31:04,379 --> 00:31:07,464
Is there anybody else on the project team that is going to be speaking?

352
00:31:10,402 --> 00:31:12,803
No, I think that's it for now, Mr. Chairman.

353
00:31:12,823 --> 00:31:16,323
Certainly, we're here to answer any questions or comments you may have.

354
00:31:16,403 --> 00:31:21,524
But again, just to conclude, this is Mark Vaughn for the record.

355
00:31:21,544 --> 00:31:38,308
I hope that you can hopefully see from the totality of what we're talking about, we did listen intently to what we think the board's desires were to see what we could do to provide some more global improvements to the area, recognizing that we

356
00:31:38,728 --> 00:31:45,491
You know, we can't, you know, fix everything that's out there in terms of, you know, traffic or whatever it might be on Middle Six Avenue.

357
00:31:45,511 --> 00:31:52,434
But I think that was acknowledged early on that, you know, that wasn't something that we were going to be in a position to have to address.

358
00:31:52,454 --> 00:32:02,057
But I think certainly there's a significant improvement overall that we're providing here to the total site and the project in general.

359
00:32:02,217 --> 00:32:02,958
So thank you.

360
00:32:04,118 --> 00:32:05,459
Certainly appreciate your efforts.

361
00:32:06,179 --> 00:32:07,400
Is there anything in the

362
00:32:09,178 --> 00:32:18,124
letters by city department heads that you believe you're not going to be able to comply with?

363
00:32:20,385 --> 00:32:22,827
Mr. Chair, this is Austin Turner from Bowler.

364
00:32:23,587 --> 00:32:25,929
With respect, I know we received the engineering letter.

365
00:32:26,549 --> 00:32:30,632
I didn't see anything in there that we haven't already discussed with Ms.

366
00:32:30,672 --> 00:32:31,953
McGivern already.

367
00:32:32,553 --> 00:32:38,737
And many of those things are seeming like suggested conditions rather than they are anything that we can't

368
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,162
commit to or aren't willing to do already.

369
00:32:41,442 --> 00:32:43,584
So with respect to that, no, sir.

370
00:32:44,384 --> 00:32:44,645
OK.

371
00:32:45,545 --> 00:32:45,826
Thank you.

372
00:32:46,186 --> 00:32:49,949
And I do know that city engineer Tim McIvern is here.

373
00:32:49,989 --> 00:32:56,815
So I'm wondering if he could just take a moment to provide us with his opinion about these revisions.

374
00:32:58,717 --> 00:32:58,877
Sure.

375
00:32:58,897 --> 00:32:59,718
Yeah, basically.

376
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:09,528
From the initial review letter, everything's been satisfactorily addressed when it comes to the site utilities and requests that I made for some design changes.

377
00:33:10,148 --> 00:33:16,134
So I converted all of the remaining open items into conditions.

378
00:33:16,654 --> 00:33:24,321
And they're just reasonable conditions that are based off of conversations that we've had with the project via the letters.

379
00:33:25,883 --> 00:33:30,425
The only thing that we're waiting on now is just resolution on the traffic related items.

380
00:33:31,666 --> 00:33:38,550
And just to, Todd Blake is here, you could talk to them, but I believe we just want a little bit more time.

381
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:45,674
And the fact that they're requesting the continuation is definitely acceptable to us too, so we can make sure that we have a full understanding of the proposal.

382
00:33:47,195 --> 00:33:52,958
Okay, would Mr. Blake like to say anything at this time or will he hold the next month?

383
00:33:53,538 --> 00:33:53,879
I don't know.

384
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:56,030
Sure.

385
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:58,811
Oh, there he is, there he is.

386
00:33:58,971 --> 00:34:08,415
Yeah, I'll hold for official, but it does seem like a vast improvement to the before, and it does seem like they tried to address a lot of the concerns we had and a lot of suggestions.

387
00:34:09,896 --> 00:34:10,356
Thank you.

388
00:34:10,817 --> 00:34:11,457
Looks pretty good.

389
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:16,279
Let me open up to questions and comments from board members.

390
00:34:16,579 --> 00:34:22,942
And just as a heads up, I think after the board members give their questions and comments, we'll close the

391
00:34:24,137 --> 00:34:31,843
the hearing at that time, since we're going to be continuing it to � I won't close it, but we'll continue it to September.

392
00:34:34,325 --> 00:34:35,886
Klaus, I know that you wanted to speak.

393
00:34:36,587 --> 00:34:37,388
Why don't you go first?

394
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:40,710
Q3.

395
00:34:42,171 --> 00:34:42,552
Thank you.

396
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:49,477
I think my biggest suggestion, concern,

397
00:34:51,647 --> 00:34:52,988
Is the location of the dumpster.

398
00:34:53,248 --> 00:34:57,789
I think it could probably be in a better location instead of their front of the project.

399
00:34:57,969 --> 00:35:17,236
I mean if you're trying to Portray a good entry and Standing in Medford having the first thing you see when you come to the site being there and I know it's I know it's landscaped around it, but that never quite does the trick and

400
00:35:17,935 --> 00:35:23,217
I think now that you have that traffic island on the left side of the post, you could probably put the dumpster there.

401
00:35:23,237 --> 00:35:31,521
It might be a bit of a challenge with how the truck will maneuver, but I think it's a much better location.

402
00:35:33,401 --> 00:35:36,643
We'd be happy to take a look at that as part of a forthcoming update.

403
00:35:36,663 --> 00:35:39,564
That seems like a more than reasonable request.

404
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:42,405
Thank you, Klaas.

405
00:35:42,425 --> 00:35:46,907
Are there other board members that would like to comment?

406
00:35:48,495 --> 00:35:49,736
Yes, Andre.

407
00:35:49,796 --> 00:35:50,937
This is Jackie Patato.

408
00:35:50,997 --> 00:35:59,184
I just wanted to just reiterate what has already been mentioned by other board members as well as the city engineer, Tim McGiven.

409
00:36:00,425 --> 00:36:09,773
I just want to thank the proponent for one, for even considering trying to rectify the nuisance conditions and provide additional benefits to

410
00:36:10,247 --> 00:36:11,348
the community in that area.

411
00:36:11,528 --> 00:36:17,731
While we recognize that not everything could be done, not every proponent would have taken it that seriously.

412
00:36:17,791 --> 00:36:26,875
So at this point, I'm sort of, I'm also very thrilled that this has been, is going to be continued so that we can look at the resolution on the traffic.

413
00:36:27,195 --> 00:36:34,859
That's where my main concern has been, but just with everything else, again, I just wanted to just thank the proponent for all of these efforts.

414
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:37,860
Thank you, Jackie.

415
00:36:38,883 --> 00:36:40,204
Other board members have comments?

416
00:36:44,968 --> 00:36:52,214
Okay, hearing none, we need to continue to a date certain.

417
00:36:52,314 --> 00:36:54,636
So let's figure out what that will be.

418
00:36:54,656 --> 00:37:02,943
I believe we have, so we have September 10th, 16th, 17th,

419
00:37:06,788 --> 00:37:08,888
are all possibilities.

420
00:37:12,269 --> 00:37:19,650
Is there a preference among board members or are you inclined to do September 10th?

421
00:37:25,331 --> 00:37:28,552
Alicia and Annie, any thoughts?

422
00:37:29,772 --> 00:37:34,053
Annie, do you wanna talk about scheduling and

423
00:37:35,444 --> 00:37:37,387
other agenda items.

424
00:37:37,808 --> 00:37:49,385
So basically, if the board would prefer to start breaking things up and having two meetings in a month so that things aren't all the same night and quite so long, then the 10th would be great.

425
00:37:51,653 --> 00:38:05,564
Um, the board is likely, well, I think actually we now know is going to be required to have a meeting later in the month because there's another item coming from the city council with one of those required must be advertised.

426
00:38:05,644 --> 00:38:11,589
We can't get it advertised for the 10th, um, must be heard before a certain date.

427
00:38:12,249 --> 00:38:16,853
Um, so it's going to need to be heard during the later weeks of September.

428
00:38:16,873 --> 00:38:16,913
Um,

429
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:41,110
would uh so i'm just putting it out there the 16th would be fine as long as we get the advertisement in tomorrow is that correct annie i know any was having trouble the 10th would also be okay with the ad in tomorrow the 10th and the 16th are the same advertising dates so okay and if we were to do the 16th would we be able to catch the other item that you were referring to

430
00:38:41,648 --> 00:38:44,871
Actually, it sounds like you could do it the 10th.

431
00:38:44,911 --> 00:38:48,614
I misunderstood Annie earlier when she was giving me the dates for the newspaper.

432
00:38:48,654 --> 00:38:52,577
It just means that she has to put the ad in the newspaper for the other item tomorrow.

433
00:38:53,137 --> 00:38:55,519
Okay.

434
00:38:55,639 --> 00:39:01,324
Of the board members, are you able to attend on the September 10th, the Thursday?

435
00:39:04,806 --> 00:39:10,371
Do we know anything about the scheduling for the board member who's not present?

436
00:39:12,426 --> 00:39:12,786
Do not.

437
00:39:14,668 --> 00:39:15,008
I do not.

438
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:22,773
Andre, if it has to be a date, sir, and I'm not available on the 10th, but I can become available.

439
00:39:22,834 --> 00:39:25,415
It's just, it's sensitive for me right now.

440
00:39:26,956 --> 00:39:28,378
Would the 16th be better for you?

441
00:39:29,138 --> 00:39:29,718
Definitely.

442
00:39:29,739 --> 00:39:31,920
Okay.

443
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:34,062
How does the 16th sound then for everyone?

444
00:39:36,343 --> 00:39:36,944
Sounds good to me.

445
00:39:38,757 --> 00:39:41,158
Okay, let's go with September 16th then.

446
00:39:41,198 --> 00:39:51,763
So is there a motion on the floor to continue the public hearing on the BJ's project to Wednesday, September 16th?

447
00:39:54,684 --> 00:39:55,925
This is Jackie Patato.

448
00:39:56,005 --> 00:40:04,949
I propose a motion to continue the Middlesex Ave BJ's gas station proposal project, proposed project to hearing to

449
00:40:07,263 --> 00:40:09,024
Wednesday, September 16th, 2020.

450
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:12,185
All right, thank you.

451
00:40:12,205 --> 00:40:13,345
Is there a second to the motion?

452
00:40:16,566 --> 00:40:17,707
This is Deanna, I'll second.

453
00:40:18,487 --> 00:40:19,167
Thank you, Deanna.

454
00:40:19,787 --> 00:40:20,347
Roll call.

455
00:40:22,348 --> 00:40:24,289
Cles Andreson.

456
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:28,810
You went out of order, you tricked me.

457
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:30,951
I know, well, Christy is recused, so.

458
00:40:33,092 --> 00:40:33,632
Was that a yes?

459
00:40:34,112 --> 00:40:34,312
Yes.

460
00:40:34,772 --> 00:40:35,813
Okay.

461
00:40:35,893 --> 00:40:36,573
Jackie Purtado.

462
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:37,250
Yes.

463
00:40:38,151 --> 00:40:38,851
David Blumberg.

464
00:40:39,211 --> 00:40:39,471
Yes.

465
00:40:41,232 --> 00:40:42,973
And myself.

466
00:40:43,254 --> 00:40:43,934
Is that everybody?

467
00:40:45,215 --> 00:40:45,815
Deanna, yes.

468
00:40:46,155 --> 00:40:47,436
Oh, Deanna, there you go, up front.

469
00:40:48,536 --> 00:40:49,797
And myself.

470
00:40:49,837 --> 00:40:52,359
So that's 5-0, the motion.

471
00:40:52,659 --> 00:40:54,860
The hearing is continued to September 16.

472
00:40:56,241 --> 00:41:00,783
Thank you very much for coming to present tonight, and appreciate your efforts to improve the project.

473
00:41:01,624 --> 00:41:02,064
Thank you, everybody.

474
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:02,364
Thank you.

475
00:41:02,904 --> 00:41:03,405
Thanks for your time.

476
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:04,580
Thank you.

477
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:05,740
Good night.

478
00:41:06,601 --> 00:41:06,941
You too.

479
00:41:10,682 --> 00:41:18,004
Next item on the agenda is another continued public hearing for the Winthrop Estates Definitive Subdivision.

480
00:41:19,124 --> 00:41:26,146
And it is a combined public hearing for the definitive subdivision approval and special permit for site plan review.

481
00:41:26,566 --> 00:41:30,187
Let me read the public hearing notice.

482
00:41:40,753 --> 00:41:56,244
Okay, the Medford Community Development Board shall conduct a combined public hearing on Thursday, July 16, 2020 at 6.30 p.m.

483
00:41:56,284 --> 00:42:05,450
via Zoom remote video conferencing relative to a revised definitive subdivision plan and special permit for site plan review application submitted by Waypoint Development

484
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:25,957
The project includes the creation of a roadway and 10 lot subdivision as shown on plans entitled Winthrop Estate Subdivision 541 and 551 Winthrop Street, Medford, Massachusetts, prepared by Design Consultants Inc., dated February 8th, 2019, and revised June 24th, 2019, September 5th, 2019, and March 20th, 2020.

485
00:42:26,758 --> 00:42:31,560
An earlier version of this application was denied by the Medford Community Development Board at a hearing on September 11th, 2019,

486
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:38,773
but upon appeal has been remanded to the community development board in light of additional information submitted by the applicant.

487
00:42:39,313 --> 00:42:55,903
Plans may be viewed in the office of the city clerk room 103, the office of community development room 308 or on the city's website at www.medfordma.org slash department slash community hyphen development by clicking on current CD board filings.

488
00:42:57,804 --> 00:42:59,785
Thank you again, if anybody would like to

489
00:43:00,733 --> 00:43:12,861
Members of the public wish to weigh in remotely, they can email questions and comments to OCD at Medford-MA.gov or via phone to 781-393-2480.

490
00:43:12,901 --> 00:43:13,101
That's 781-393-2480.

491
00:43:13,161 --> 00:43:13,702
Thank you.

492
00:43:27,337 --> 00:43:37,443
now reopen the public hearing and would like to ask the applicant to present the additional information that's been submitted since the last meeting.

493
00:43:38,643 --> 00:43:39,024
Thank you.

494
00:43:39,064 --> 00:43:43,126
Mr. Chairman, members of the board, my name is Ed Champion with Waypoint Development.

495
00:43:43,226 --> 00:43:47,048
We're the owner of the site, Winthrop Street Estates.

496
00:43:48,129 --> 00:43:53,171
One item to address is that we did submit to the board care of

497
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:56,191
the acting director, Ms.

498
00:43:56,211 --> 00:44:02,833
Hunt, for a name that we thought was appropriate, and it particularly came up during a neighborhood meeting.

499
00:44:04,953 --> 00:44:12,855
So we've requested, excuse the background noise, so we've requested a change of name, and that's been formally submitted.

500
00:44:14,756 --> 00:44:20,477
Mary Kenny O'Sullivan was an activist in the labor movement back in the early 1900s.

501
00:44:21,017 --> 00:44:23,118
We had originally thought Mary Kenny O'Sullivan,

502
00:44:24,046 --> 00:44:31,330
when you look at the apostrophe and all the letters, the final submission was requested at Mary Kenny Way.

503
00:44:32,411 --> 00:44:37,914
Kind of, you know, play on words with the way, so to speak, because I think she lived the right way.

504
00:44:38,695 --> 00:44:41,697
So anyways, that was one of the things that we submitted.

505
00:44:42,957 --> 00:44:49,001
For tonight, there are a couple of things that we left our last meeting with that I thought we would address.

506
00:44:49,101 --> 00:44:50,542
And one of which, which I think is the

507
00:44:51,293 --> 00:45:14,145
I don't know if it was the largest item on the list, but after leaving the meeting, it probably stuck with me the most, which was when board member Kloss had mentioned that it's up to us to show what the vision of the property and not people to read a plan in plan view and understand what it is.

508
00:45:14,766 --> 00:45:17,147
So we'll share those drawings and

509
00:45:17,978 --> 00:45:18,599
and renderings.

510
00:45:18,639 --> 00:45:30,588
We've done them to scale so that there's no interpretation, and I think that they give an accurate depiction of what we're trying to accomplish, and hopefully they'll calm some of the concerns in that area.

511
00:45:31,909 --> 00:45:42,617
So there were six different areas in total, and in trying to be brief, one was the pedestrian issues, and that comes with walking traffic and whatnot and concerns with the neighbourhood.

512
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:45,210
that we've been working with.

513
00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:58,133
Both Tim given entire were on a neighborhood call yesterday with Mrs Mayor and that was discussed, and we've agreed to not only do the sidewalk on the crosswalk to connect the corner of Lorraine Road over to, um, the Western Street side.

514
00:45:58,533 --> 00:46:02,094
We've also agreed to work with the neighborhood to try and make a safer pedestrian way.

515
00:46:02,634 --> 00:46:06,655
Temporarily while ever sources doing their work so years ago, we

516
00:46:13,256 --> 00:46:15,538
I think it didn't help the problem, but I think we learned from it.

517
00:46:15,579 --> 00:46:18,041
So I think we can do a better job this time.

518
00:46:18,601 --> 00:46:21,003
So with that, that's the pedestrian issues.

519
00:46:21,164 --> 00:46:25,027
And I think Todd and Tim are much more equipped to talk about it than I am.

520
00:46:25,688 --> 00:46:29,251
But we're happy to help and work with the team, coordinate any way we can.

521
00:46:31,033 --> 00:46:32,234
Next would be the renderings.

522
00:46:32,534 --> 00:46:34,356
And I think the best way to do is to show them.

523
00:46:34,476 --> 00:46:38,059
So if I could share a screen, I can put them up.

524
00:46:50,992 --> 00:46:53,835
I think I'm almost host disabled.

525
00:46:54,576 --> 00:46:56,898
I can work on some other things in the meantime.

526
00:47:00,162 --> 00:47:02,004
You should be able to share now.

527
00:47:02,364 --> 00:47:03,185
Yes, perfect.

528
00:47:03,245 --> 00:47:11,473
Thank you.

529
00:47:12,074 --> 00:47:13,015
Can everyone see the rendering?

530
00:47:14,261 --> 00:47:15,081
Yes, thank you.

531
00:47:15,962 --> 00:47:16,022
OK.

532
00:47:16,042 --> 00:47:20,063
So this is a cover slide, and it'll back off a little from more.

533
00:47:20,183 --> 00:47:24,405
If this is considered 1,000 feet, let's say the next one's going to be at 6,000 feet or so.

534
00:47:24,905 --> 00:47:28,066
I'm using numbers just as a guide, not necessarily as specifics.

535
00:47:28,726 --> 00:47:41,491
So this is the site itself, where the right-of-way easement extension would be right in here, wraps along the site, and services both 553 and 555 Winthrop Street.

536
00:47:44,314 --> 00:47:51,000
The cut in the site runs around the perimeter and there's a vegetated slope as well as a

537
00:47:54,103 --> 00:47:57,224
and there's vegetative slope in the bottom and vines growing over.

538
00:47:57,384 --> 00:47:59,945
I'm gonna move to the slides, because they'll show it better than my explanation.

539
00:48:00,666 --> 00:48:07,048
Mr. Champion, could you just, well, since you had mentioned the pedestrian improvements, could you just point them out with your cursor on this?

540
00:48:07,548 --> 00:48:21,754
Sure, so they're not drawn in here, but there'll be a handicap ramp and a sidewalk right in here, and it will connect right across the street, and it connects into the sidewalk on the other side of Winthrop Street, and that's part of our plan and the definitive subdivision plan.

541
00:48:23,075 --> 00:48:32,651
As part of the other neighborhood concerns, it was running, it was walking down this section here towards the gas station, where it's a little bit depressed.

542
00:48:33,405 --> 00:48:38,347
as far as, you know, it's concave from the edge of the road and it stores water after rain to a certain extent.

543
00:48:38,787 --> 00:48:58,956
So the idea was that although Eversource is gonna repave and there's a bigger plan for sidewalks in here, it was gonna be that we're willing to, and of course it would require the approval of DPW and the engineering department to either put some temporary walkway in here of some sort, whether it's a asphalt binder or something that would just allow

544
00:49:00,408 --> 00:49:05,511
to give a dry or a space that's outside of the watershed.

545
00:49:05,972 --> 00:49:14,458
Again, it's something that we've agreed to do with the neighbors if it's something that can be done, but we're not making the engineering decision on our own.

546
00:49:14,478 --> 00:49:16,419
We're just offering to work with them.

547
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:21,963
This past couple of weeks, we actually put some screen up on the fencing as a request to the neighbors.

548
00:49:23,655 --> 00:49:41,039
We engaged some younger local workers to actually start cleaning and weeding the sidewalk, and we had them go all the way from the high school, all the way up past our site, and they'll continue through this section on towards Smith Lane.

549
00:49:41,139 --> 00:49:42,439
I think it's Smith Lane or Smith Road.

550
00:49:42,519 --> 00:49:43,339
It's up on the other side.

551
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:45,300
We also talked about

552
00:49:46,642 --> 00:50:07,209
you know, again, our willingness to do it, and it's a coordination of engineering and DPW, is if some temporary asphalt, if it's helpful to lay some sort of extension here so that there's a walkway towards, apparently from Smith Lane to Lorain, there's some concerns that, you know, when people are walking with strollers or walking on the street, that they end up getting

553
00:50:07,995 --> 00:50:11,760
derailed into traffic a bit during, if there's a rain day.

554
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:17,586
I mean, of course, this summer there hasn't been too many rain days, but I think that with the fall coming, we'll probably see more of it.

555
00:50:18,427 --> 00:50:19,128
Is that sufficient?

556
00:50:20,049 --> 00:50:20,610
Yes, thank you.

557
00:50:27,513 --> 00:50:37,020
This is a, we expanded the view just to give some vision of where it is, where the site is, the soccer field that's behind it and the high school itself.

558
00:50:37,921 --> 00:50:44,646
And this is the area where the sidewalk, where we're starting here at the entrance to the high school and running down, and this is the Smith Lane.

559
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:53,913
So we're gonna, we've committed to the neighborhood that we will take care of that section of sidewalk from now until we're completed with construction totality.

560
00:50:54,766 --> 00:50:59,149
The replacement of the sidewalk will be from the lot limits in front of the site.

561
00:50:59,610 --> 00:51:04,873
Of course, if we damage anything, we would replace it beyond that, but we don't anticipate being anywhere beyond that.

562
00:51:09,777 --> 00:51:10,077
Thank you.

563
00:51:11,278 --> 00:51:14,320
Okay, so again, we're getting into the renderings now.

564
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:20,144
It's a 10 lot subdivision, and I'm going to pass this slide because I don't think it adds to the process.

565
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:23,021
So this is the general site.

566
00:51:23,461 --> 00:51:40,093
We did actually draw the houses and after working with the architect and they took a shot at the modern farmhouse design, we started thinking that it was, it started exciting us a little bit, to be honest with you, about what the site could be.

567
00:51:40,473 --> 00:51:47,358
There is a slide in here that has no homes on it, so that the perspective that Woodward McLeod asked for will show up here.

568
00:51:50,215 --> 00:51:51,576
This is the view from Lorain Road.

569
00:51:53,317 --> 00:51:57,880
On the left-hand side, running up this is where the extension of the right-of-way is.

570
00:51:59,281 --> 00:52:04,485
The street trees and whatnot block quite a bit, but they're a requirement and they are as proposed on the plan.

571
00:52:05,946 --> 00:52:09,788
And you can see the view from the Lorain Road side.

572
00:52:12,410 --> 00:52:16,953
This is the view from Lorain Road if there are no houses and no street trees.

573
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:22,456
I refrained from putting the street trees on, even though they're part of the road design, because I didn't want to cover it.

574
00:52:23,016 --> 00:52:29,379
And so it shows a change in elevation with the stone wall, which we talked about.

575
00:52:30,259 --> 00:52:31,720
And I have some more detail to add on that.

576
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:37,242
The change in elevations that would be yards or grass or plantings or whatever people choose to have.

577
00:52:37,903 --> 00:52:42,605
The vegetated slope, which is a one to one or one to two, depending on the area that you're looking at.

578
00:52:43,825 --> 00:52:46,006
And then from at the top of the vegetated slope,

579
00:52:46,817 --> 00:52:48,857
there's the Shark Creek wall.

580
00:52:49,878 --> 00:52:56,339
And growing down from the Shark Creek wall is some sort of vegetation.

581
00:52:56,979 --> 00:53:02,281
And it's the expectation here is that we're showing like a three to five year growth.

582
00:53:04,301 --> 00:53:10,043
We think that we won't, you know, the houses will be sold and done in the three year time period.

583
00:53:10,243 --> 00:53:12,283
And we think it'll be grown in fully at that point.

584
00:53:13,403 --> 00:53:14,624
If you work your way around,

585
00:53:16,648 --> 00:53:28,811
this section of ledge, and I'll show it later with the houses, we zoomed in on it and we gave a height, it's approximately 40 feet tall from the very bottom, and that's including the vegetative slope.

586
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:42,174
And then you work your way around and you can see where the right-of-way extension comes in and drops into what we'll call Mary Kenny Way for the time being, and then allows that traffic to come in and out.

587
00:53:42,774 --> 00:53:45,295
I think it's gonna be a benefit when we've talked to one of the neighbors

588
00:53:47,268 --> 00:53:47,948
and I'll call her Ms.

589
00:53:47,968 --> 00:53:50,770
Shreya, because I can't, her last name is extensive.

590
00:53:52,331 --> 00:54:01,015
And, you know, she had mentioned that driving on and off Winthrop Street from their current right of way, that getting out onto that road is tricky.

591
00:54:01,436 --> 00:54:03,737
So we think this will be a big benefit for that.

592
00:54:04,257 --> 00:54:11,461
And we've supplied the documentation to the neighbors for the easement, allowing their council and whatnot to review it.

593
00:54:11,961 --> 00:54:15,403
But they have everything they need for the right of way itself.

594
00:54:19,592 --> 00:54:24,217
This is if you're traveling east, which is a similar direction that we showed in the sketches.

595
00:54:24,257 --> 00:54:28,641
However, we think this is a better way to depict it as far as showing what's going on.

596
00:54:29,042 --> 00:54:37,350
This section of vegetation in here is something that we are gonna make part of the HOA, which is adjacent to the sidewalk, so it'll be maintained.

597
00:54:41,550 --> 00:54:43,192
This is the view facing west.

598
00:54:43,693 --> 00:54:45,555
This stone wall has been a discussion.

599
00:54:46,296 --> 00:54:48,218
I've got some landscape plans that add to it.

600
00:54:48,879 --> 00:54:52,103
And what we did on the landscape plan is we called out two things.

601
00:54:52,223 --> 00:54:57,189
One is what we kind of want it to be, which is a medium-sized stacked wall of some sort.

602
00:54:58,210 --> 00:55:06,535
We've also wanted to reserve the right to make a natural stone, depending on how much flat quality stone comes out of the blasting.

603
00:55:07,456 --> 00:55:12,319
But what we also did was we denoted what it could not be or what it would not be.

604
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:16,413
And without using a brand name, right, it's a big block wall.

605
00:55:16,574 --> 00:55:21,397
Like, you know, the big commercial style, even though they have a rock face to them, they look very industrial.

606
00:55:21,477 --> 00:55:25,700
So we qualified that it's got to be below like an 18 by 36 size.

607
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:29,063
So you could get two foot by one foot blocks or whatnot.

608
00:55:29,183 --> 00:55:35,887
So that it would fit within the scale of a residential environment, especially we're so close to the sidewalk, we think the size matters.

609
00:55:38,009 --> 00:55:39,570
And that is on a plan that was submitted.

610
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:41,972
And the notes that I'm describing are on the plan as well.

611
00:55:42,816 --> 00:55:48,040
I believe they were clouded and called out so that it would be clear.

612
00:55:49,881 --> 00:55:51,683
This is driving into the cul-de-sac itself.

613
00:55:52,884 --> 00:55:57,167
There's the island and the houses surrounding it.

614
00:55:57,207 --> 00:56:00,790
The house straight on is the one that's adjacent to the ledge that we talked about.

615
00:56:02,775 --> 00:56:06,397
So this, and I'll show that slide in a second.

616
00:56:06,457 --> 00:56:09,318
This slide shows a couple of cross sections that we're showing.

617
00:56:09,938 --> 00:56:19,982
And these cross sections were primarily done to show what the wall would look like if you were perpendicular to it and if you were in a cross section.

618
00:56:20,222 --> 00:56:24,604
Although it's a bit of a view that you would normally take if you were a professional.

619
00:56:25,104 --> 00:56:30,487
I think it was based on the conversation with the board last meeting.

620
00:56:30,527 --> 00:56:31,287
I think that this makes,

621
00:56:33,256 --> 00:56:34,477
This answers a few questions.

622
00:56:35,358 --> 00:56:40,202
So when we go to page 10, we're gonna see this cross section.

623
00:56:40,622 --> 00:56:43,304
And we go to page 11, we're gonna see this cross section.

624
00:56:44,405 --> 00:56:45,646
And this is Ms.

625
00:56:45,666 --> 00:56:49,009
Shria's house right here, 555 Winthrop.

626
00:56:49,529 --> 00:56:50,690
And this is 553 Winthrop.

627
00:56:55,214 --> 00:56:57,656
So this is the cross section in the backyard of lot five.

628
00:56:59,197 --> 00:57:01,699
The expectation is a patio, small grass area.

629
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:09,503
low retaining wall under four feet, vegetated slope, the wall itself, and the hanging lines.

630
00:57:10,063 --> 00:57:12,164
And this is the cross section of where it ends up going.

631
00:57:17,668 --> 00:57:26,573
This is the cross section, which is 90 degrees from there, where 553 Winthrop and 555 Winthrop are directly to the left.

632
00:57:26,913 --> 00:57:30,175
Actually, 553 Winthrop is right where my carousel is up here.

633
00:57:31,436 --> 00:57:32,537
The expectation is that

634
00:57:33,435 --> 00:57:40,699
there'll be, at this point, is that you're looking, you're seeing some rooftops, but you're actually not looking into the buildings themselves.

635
00:57:41,279 --> 00:57:47,682
And there's a little bit of distance between this fence, and then there's a right of way, and then there's the front yards.

636
00:57:52,325 --> 00:58:03,170
What I did here was Medford, based on the zoning, has allowed the height of the building, and the building commissioner, of course, would have to approve the plans and whatnot, but it's a 35 foot mean height of the roof.

637
00:58:04,103 --> 00:58:10,224
I believe, and so that roof probably stands, the peak of the roof probably is at 38, 39, or 40 feet.

638
00:58:10,764 --> 00:58:19,306
And if you go from that same top of retaining wall up to the top of the ledge wall of Shaw Creek, it's 40 feet.

639
00:58:19,406 --> 00:58:23,887
So scale-wise, again, the building is gonna be equal to that height.

640
00:58:23,947 --> 00:58:29,348
Of course, you'd be 250 feet away from it when you're looking at it, unless you actually lived in the house, then you'd be much closer.

641
00:58:31,809 --> 00:58:34,030
Just a question, Mr. Champy.

642
00:58:34,870 --> 00:58:40,472
I don't see in this, and this just could be because it's not there, is the fencing at the top of that ledge?

643
00:58:41,152 --> 00:58:42,372
It is up there.

644
00:58:43,333 --> 00:58:44,193
You can see it in here.

645
00:58:44,693 --> 00:58:44,913
Yep.

646
00:58:49,995 --> 00:58:51,695
So it could just be at the angle we're at.

647
00:58:51,715 --> 00:58:52,615
We're looking right over it.

648
00:58:53,076 --> 00:58:53,296
Yep.

649
00:58:56,057 --> 00:58:59,438
But it will be at, it'll be close to the edge, I'm assuming, of the ledge?

650
00:59:02,552 --> 00:59:03,833
Can you see the site plan here?

651
00:59:05,473 --> 00:59:05,693
Yeah.

652
00:59:06,134 --> 00:59:06,394
Okay.

653
00:59:06,814 --> 00:59:14,397
So the, the, the fencing itself is set back from the, from the very top because there's like a, there's a small slope prior to getting in.

654
00:59:15,478 --> 00:59:20,560
So you, there's a small slope they were here prior to.

655
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:21,400
Okay.

656
00:59:22,801 --> 00:59:26,283
And there's also a guide rail that's coming down around the, on the right away itself.

657
00:59:30,608 --> 00:59:41,775
And then this is a close-up of behind lot five of what the wall will look like when you're sitting in the back patio.

658
00:59:43,696 --> 00:59:50,640
The vegetative slope, the wall, I mean, we've been clear in the HOA documents as well as the discussions with

659
00:59:51,464 --> 01:00:02,428
Mr. McGibbon on what the requirements are for what's being maintained by the HOA versus the homeowners, and this vegetative slope is within the HOA responsibility and is enforceable.

660
01:00:06,610 --> 01:00:11,672
So that's the renderings themselves.

661
01:00:16,133 --> 01:00:19,014
The wall itself and the landscape plan, and because I think this is,

662
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:22,530
that we're going to show you.

663
01:00:22,550 --> 01:00:23,110
It's not going to be.

664
01:00:23,130 --> 01:00:26,832
Duplicate and but at the same time, I want to show it just to make sure that we're understood.

665
01:00:26,852 --> 01:00:29,012
So there's this fence that's on the top here.

666
01:00:29,032 --> 01:00:30,573
We anticipate that being by owner.

667
01:00:30,853 --> 01:00:34,134
It'll be part of the package that we're selling, especially if we're building the house.

668
01:00:34,654 --> 01:00:35,635
This segmented wall.

669
01:00:35,695 --> 01:00:40,836
This is where it talks about limitate limiting this the size of the stone so they don't end up being too large.

670
01:00:41,757 --> 01:00:41,977
Um.

671
01:00:44,458 --> 01:00:45,918
This This is part of landscape

672
01:00:51,835 --> 01:00:53,936
than it is appearance.

673
01:00:55,177 --> 01:01:06,123
And this was one of the segmented wall, typical installation of what we see as far as the size of the stones being, you know, these in this case are probably six or 12 inches high and maybe 30 inches long.

674
01:01:06,263 --> 01:01:12,646
So we want to make sure that it's adequate and reflecting that it's a residential subdivision.

675
01:01:19,910 --> 01:01:20,230
Thank you.

676
01:01:21,775 --> 01:01:34,700
Okay, I think that covers the, we did submit our blasting plan, and I think during the neighborhood meetings and even in my private conversations with neighbors, blasting has been a, is a big topic.

677
01:01:36,441 --> 01:01:40,403
So we've talked about expanding the pre-blast survey.

678
01:01:40,423 --> 01:01:43,884
We've got numerous extra names on the list, and we're gonna adhere to that.

679
01:01:45,485 --> 01:01:50,227
There's a few other things relative to the blasting, which is, you know, seismic meters and whatnot.

680
01:01:50,670 --> 01:01:58,735
So they are already placed around the site when you're doing the blasting, but we've agreed in a couple of cases to actually put some extra meters out there.

681
01:01:59,496 --> 01:02:06,800
Last, we're planning to be at half the legal limit, which allows to make sure that we never approach the legal limit.

682
01:02:08,301 --> 01:02:18,148
And that's what we've done prior to, so I'm not suggesting it's gonna be any less, it's just we are explaining that it is a controlled environment and we have a fair amount of control over it.

683
01:02:19,489 --> 01:02:36,148
neighbors that are immediate 525 went through approaches just to the right was the closest probably to any of the blasting and we haven't we haven't heard from that neighbor but we've done mailings and whatnot but I think it's a rental so it's not the same amount of participation that we'd expect from homeowners and

684
01:02:40,341 --> 01:02:44,182
We had a neighbors meeting last night where a group of neighbors came on, as I mentioned earlier.

685
01:02:44,722 --> 01:02:48,544
And then lastly is the right of way, which we've submitted to the neighbors for 553 and 555.

686
01:02:49,944 --> 01:02:53,445
There's been interaction between attorneys on 553 Winthrop.

687
01:02:54,166 --> 01:02:57,767
And Shreya and I have talked many times and we talked again today.

688
01:02:58,187 --> 01:03:00,328
So we believe we're in good shape.

689
01:03:04,149 --> 01:03:04,369
Okay.

690
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:05,748
Thank you.

691
01:03:05,788 --> 01:03:12,390
Well, these visuals, I think, are very helpful, and I appreciate your efforts in getting those done.

692
01:03:16,470 --> 01:03:18,691
So we have a few things to cover.

693
01:03:18,831 --> 01:03:32,694
I'd like to open it up first to the city engineer, Tim McGivern, to provide his overall opinion and comments on

694
01:03:34,492 --> 01:03:36,373
on the project and what's been presented?

695
01:03:39,755 --> 01:03:39,995
Sure.

696
01:03:41,276 --> 01:03:47,059
So at this point, after... And touch on any outstanding issues that you think are maybe there?

697
01:03:48,219 --> 01:03:48,460
Sure.

698
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:48,740
Yep.

699
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:57,985
So basically, after three rounds of going back and forth with information and discussion, the most recent

700
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:04,661
memorandum that I put together for the board, boils everything down to a set of conditions, basically.

701
01:04:06,802 --> 01:04:22,885
The items that the board may wish to discuss further that were on here, but weren't necessarily discussed to a close-out level, I didn't feel, were any additional pedestrian accommodations up to the high school.

702
01:04:23,245 --> 01:04:26,486
It was discussed, but there was really no conclusion on it, so I just left it in here.

703
01:04:29,950 --> 01:04:37,613
Then I put a recommended condition in here regarding what the homeowners association is going to have control over.

704
01:04:38,113 --> 01:04:50,877
And I just would like to note that I believe one was just brought up that I did not have on my list and that was the vegetated area between the driveway, the private driveway going through the site and with the tree itself.

705
01:04:50,917 --> 01:04:53,017
So that should be added.

706
01:04:55,881 --> 01:04:59,744
A lot of conditions regarding construction and inspections.

707
01:05:00,185 --> 01:05:10,273
So just so everybody knows, one of the things I'm requiring of the project through condition is a detailed inspection schedule based off of this board's regulations for subdivisions.

708
01:05:10,793 --> 01:05:19,500
So the city needs to provide a reasonable level of inspection for the utility installations and the roadway installations.

709
01:05:20,581 --> 01:05:24,885
So that's something that will have, all that will happen through this board as well.

710
01:05:28,744 --> 01:05:30,146
Anything else outstanding?

711
01:05:30,186 --> 01:05:31,447
Let's see.

712
01:05:31,487 --> 01:05:46,040
There was one, every single plan revision except for one was made, and it may have just been an oversight, but the sewer services for 553 and 555 Winthrop Street, I requested that they be placed on the plan.

713
01:05:46,421 --> 01:05:47,462
They were not placed in the plan.

714
01:05:47,882 --> 01:05:50,905
The final set of plans should have those services on there.

715
01:05:52,843 --> 01:06:01,249
I don't think that they need to be relocated or removed, they just need to be protected during construction, unless they're in a spot that isn't shown on the record plans.

716
01:06:01,650 --> 01:06:07,234
So just that, they need to be protected, so we need to know where they are, so they should be on the plans that everybody looks at.

717
01:06:08,475 --> 01:06:13,879
One second here.

718
01:06:19,442 --> 01:06:22,805
That's about it regarding conditions.

719
01:06:23,345 --> 01:06:30,931
And you know, a lot of it is just basic stuff like they need the contractor installing the utilities needs to be a licensed drain layer in the city.

720
01:06:33,673 --> 01:06:36,936
They should submit a road control plan to the Board of Health.

721
01:06:39,678 --> 01:06:39,818
And

722
01:06:42,795 --> 01:06:48,499
The only other thing I think is worth saying is that the set of plans that I reviewed this final round only included revised sheets.

723
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:51,101
And I believe they're also working on the landscaping sheets.

724
01:06:51,562 --> 01:06:56,405
The final set of plans should be all of the sheets.

725
01:06:56,926 --> 01:07:02,530
And then also another thing that's worth noting, I think too, is the cut and fill analysis is gonna be a large part of probably the cost.

726
01:07:02,890 --> 01:07:10,616
So anytime there's a request for a bond reduction, they should do a refresh of the cut and fill analysis.

727
01:07:10,676 --> 01:07:12,377
So basically, so I don't have to do it.

728
01:07:12,905 --> 01:07:13,866
And we're using the same numbers.

729
01:07:13,886 --> 01:07:20,130
And I can just double check the numbers, sort of a quality control type check.

730
01:07:23,652 --> 01:07:27,875
Besides that, like I said, everything else was turned into a condition.

731
01:07:27,955 --> 01:07:29,917
I think I got 22 conditions in total.

732
01:07:36,348 --> 01:07:43,374
So, and I know there was some communication received today about one of those conditions regarding the right of way.

733
01:07:43,415 --> 01:07:51,402
And I do also understand that there's a couple of questions on the table for me regarding things like building permits and timing of those.

734
01:07:51,882 --> 01:07:54,465
I'm more than happy to talk about those now or later, doesn't matter.

735
01:07:55,045 --> 01:08:01,231
But probably the condition having to do with the easement and the private driveway is worth a discussion.

736
01:08:07,066 --> 01:08:19,170
So on, and Mr. Champy, do you anticipate any issues with compliance with any of the matters that Mr. McGiven has raised in his letter?

737
01:08:20,170 --> 01:08:21,690
I don't, I don't.

738
01:08:21,730 --> 01:08:23,851
And I appreciate the list.

739
01:08:24,251 --> 01:08:25,931
A lot of it, to be honest, we would expect.

740
01:08:27,212 --> 01:08:29,052
So I think it's normal course of business.

741
01:08:29,653 --> 01:08:34,514
The pedestrian route to the high school, which Mr. McGiven had mentioned, wasn't quite closed out.

742
01:08:35,310 --> 01:08:47,300
You know, we did look at it, and if you'd like, you know, essentially that would put a path either between 525 Winthrop and us.

743
01:08:47,340 --> 01:08:49,602
And if you'd like, I can share a screen showing where that would be.

744
01:08:50,563 --> 01:08:59,030
Or it would give the right-of-way access on the other side.

745
01:08:59,050 --> 01:09:00,572
And I'll show you.

746
01:09:02,262 --> 01:09:03,843
So we're concerned.

747
01:09:04,283 --> 01:09:06,464
We've been doing development for some time.

748
01:09:06,504 --> 01:09:09,345
We're putting a path in an area like that.

749
01:09:10,725 --> 01:09:13,506
It would be putting a path running up this side of the property.

750
01:09:13,526 --> 01:09:16,207
Let me see if I can zoom in one more.

751
01:09:16,347 --> 01:09:20,088
In order to get to the high school, you would be traversing across the path.

752
01:09:20,528 --> 01:09:22,809
You get into areas where they're not well lit.

753
01:09:23,710 --> 01:09:24,930
There's only so much space.

754
01:09:25,070 --> 01:09:30,252
We would be literally probably trying to get a neighbor to coordinate with us to create an easement in their property.

755
01:09:31,684 --> 01:09:49,339
So we just think it's difficult to execute, and normally we're asked not to create five foot long, nowhere to go paths and walkways.

756
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:57,846
And I think running it up the right of way to actually, this is private property in here,

757
01:09:59,083 --> 01:10:01,745
And there's just, when we looked at it, there were a couple issues.

758
01:10:01,785 --> 01:10:07,028
I think if it was a 25-yard path that cut off a quarter mile, the kids would find it anyway.

759
01:10:07,348 --> 01:10:15,512
But my point is, I think this is a fairly lengthy, aggressive path to put in, and it would probably end up having to traverse through the fells in order to be useful.

760
01:10:17,093 --> 01:10:28,740
So we're open to discussion on it, but at the same time, we think it's kind of a cool idea, but executing-wise, I think it's super tricky.

761
01:10:30,175 --> 01:10:34,297
Yeah, personally, my preference is not to do that.

762
01:10:34,357 --> 01:10:38,360
But I don't know, do any of the other board members have an opinion about that?

763
01:10:43,243 --> 01:10:50,087
Are there any other paths that cut through from the high school into basically not down the driveway?

764
01:10:51,087 --> 01:10:53,509
There's a fence that's through here.

765
01:10:53,789 --> 01:10:57,291
There's a fence that we don't own that's already up in this area.

766
01:11:00,536 --> 01:11:02,937
So we didn't notice any cut-throughs.

767
01:11:03,297 --> 01:11:18,580
There's a small house up in the back here, and the road to get to it runs right next, is kind of where the gate to the Fellsway, so to speak, is, and it wraps up around here and tucks in, and then there are a couple of homes fronting Winthrop Street.

768
01:11:19,620 --> 01:11:24,121
At one time, we had all this land under agreement, so we have title searches on all of it.

769
01:11:24,861 --> 01:11:27,342
When we were up there watching the sites and whatnot, we didn't see it.

770
01:11:35,282 --> 01:11:41,947
Yeah, I mean, I think it'd be a nice to have, but I don't think it's completely necessary.

771
01:11:46,751 --> 01:11:48,152
Any other board member have an opinion?

772
01:11:52,715 --> 01:11:59,300
This is Christy that I just I agree with place I it would be nice to have but

773
01:12:00,817 --> 01:12:02,077
I don't think it's necessary.

774
01:12:02,097 --> 01:12:17,141
I think it does appear from what Mr. Champy explained that it would be pretty challenging and probably impact abutters maybe more significantly than intended to get that done.

775
01:12:17,161 --> 01:12:25,983
Thank you.

776
01:12:28,269 --> 01:12:34,751
Let's try to move through some of these other items that we need to address.

777
01:12:35,251 --> 01:12:46,254
Maybe one we can dispense with up front is the suggestion around the name of the street, which we have to approve.

778
01:12:46,314 --> 01:12:48,754
That's a discretion of the Community Development Board.

779
01:12:49,374 --> 01:12:50,495
So we have a

780
01:12:53,024 --> 01:12:57,708
recommendation that the street be named Mary Kenny Way instead of Winthrop Estates.

781
01:12:57,968 --> 01:13:05,534
And part of the issue was to not have a street name that sounded like other street names already existing in the city.

782
01:13:05,674 --> 01:13:07,996
And this Mary Kenny Way does not.

783
01:13:08,096 --> 01:13:16,983
And it also gives some recognition to a local resident who has had an interesting history.

784
01:13:17,623 --> 01:13:22,487
And I don't know if anybody who knows more about that history wants to say anything about Mary Kenny.

785
01:13:24,899 --> 01:13:49,645
see if I can just stop there you go so I can see everybody great I guess the only thing I would say about that is I think it's I'm pleased that the name came about from a dialogue with the neighbors so I think I think you know

786
01:13:50,656 --> 01:13:52,717
In my mind, that's the right way to do this.

787
01:13:52,757 --> 01:13:53,677
So thank you.

788
01:13:55,698 --> 01:13:55,919
Great.

789
01:13:55,939 --> 01:14:04,422
We're going to unmute Chris Donovan, whose name is listed as user, to speak on this.

790
01:14:04,483 --> 01:14:06,423
It was actually his recommendation.

791
01:14:07,144 --> 01:14:07,564
Wonderful.

792
01:14:07,604 --> 01:14:07,924
Thank you.

793
01:14:14,627 --> 01:14:15,788
He's talking, but he's on mute.

794
01:14:16,869 --> 01:14:18,610
Yeah, now you're unmuted.

795
01:14:18,630 --> 01:14:20,151
Go ahead, Mr. Dunneman.

796
01:14:20,811 --> 01:14:21,111
Thank you.

797
01:14:21,131 --> 01:14:22,472
I think we have Doug Carr on the line.

798
01:14:22,512 --> 01:14:32,056
I think they did a little bit of sort of history deep dive on that, which I don't know if now's the time necessarily for that, but we're really kind of excited to maybe tie in a little of that history, gives it some personality.

799
01:14:32,676 --> 01:14:42,703
I was listening to a little bit earlier and I thank Ed for kind of championing some of the things that are gonna be happening in that neighborhood, even as far as that road that you were talking about as a cut through.

800
01:14:43,163 --> 01:14:51,149
I think if we did something really beautiful on Winthrop Street, that whole walkway up to Medford High would be more grand and more fun to walk up right now.

801
01:14:51,209 --> 01:14:56,212
It's really kind of a tough walk in that whole neighborhood, including the sidewalks that were mentioned.

802
01:14:56,292 --> 01:15:01,636
So I think that road, that sort of cut through road sounds nice, even as a local to cut through the high school,

803
01:15:02,136 --> 01:15:04,518
none of the main doors for the high school are on that side.

804
01:15:04,538 --> 01:15:10,721
So unless the visioning committee for the high school kind of saw some value in that, I'm not sure if that little side road.

805
01:15:10,781 --> 01:15:22,548
So these are the things that come out of sort of a neighborhood understanding of that, say example path, not that kids wouldn't use it and it wouldn't be fun, it may not be good, but the high school would have to sign on for that as an example.

806
01:15:22,929 --> 01:15:26,091
But I think through some of the initiatives that Ed was,

807
01:15:27,296 --> 01:15:37,908
promoting that we can kind of do through these beautification project is to get the winter street beautiful and get that that that that that's frontage to be something where the kids are proud to walk up that thing.

808
01:15:37,968 --> 01:15:40,370
It's see and be seen kind of thing.

809
01:15:40,390 --> 01:15:42,593
So there's a lot of talk that we had last night.

810
01:15:42,933 --> 01:15:53,923
I won't bring it into this discussion because it doesn't necessarily have to do with 551, but I think there's really good things going on between Eversource, the city, DPW, and we made a lot of forward strides.

811
01:15:53,963 --> 01:15:58,046
So that's why I'm championing a little bit of what Ed and Waypoint are doing.

812
01:15:58,546 --> 01:16:02,069
I'm glad you're holding them to feet to the fire for safety and

813
01:16:02,950 --> 01:16:27,814
uh blasting and zoning etc but as far as the neighborhood i've seen we've seen some changes and we're really you know happy to to um at least me and some of the people that were uh in some of these meetings to thank ed and the mayor and and tim and todd for meeting with us last night to moving some of this forward so the ultimate goal is when this is finished have a beautiful neighborhood um you'll be dealing with the parameters and the sizes and the shapes and the zoning that's what this is about tonight but

814
01:16:28,164 --> 01:16:34,529
As far as the neighborhood, I think we're pretty happy that we want to get this thing cleaned up and all these advances are happening soon.

815
01:16:34,569 --> 01:16:35,910
So thank you.

816
01:16:38,552 --> 01:16:39,413
Thank you, Mr. Donovan.

817
01:16:42,775 --> 01:16:48,100
Doug Cards, do you want to say anything about Mary Kenny?

818
01:16:49,241 --> 01:16:53,003
Could we also get Chris's name and address for the record?

819
01:16:54,144 --> 01:16:55,986
It's Chris Donovan for Lorain Road.

820
01:16:57,187 --> 01:16:57,447
Thank you.

821
01:17:01,388 --> 01:17:04,689
All right, Doug, you're unmuted, so name and address for the record.

822
01:17:06,289 --> 01:17:09,089
I'm Doug Carr, 124 Boston Avenue, Westminster.

823
01:17:09,229 --> 01:17:12,230
I don't have anything to add about the historical figure you're talking about.

824
01:17:13,170 --> 01:17:13,230
OK.

825
01:17:13,250 --> 01:17:15,491
I'm afraid that's something I don't know much about.

826
01:17:15,511 --> 01:17:17,571
I'm eager to learn more.

827
01:17:18,111 --> 01:17:19,211
Sorry to put you on the spot.

828
01:17:19,251 --> 01:17:21,012
I figured you might have something to say about it.

829
01:17:21,852 --> 01:17:25,972
I wish Ryan Hayward was here from the commission, because I'm sure I could tell her her entire life story.

830
01:17:27,393 --> 01:17:27,713
OK.

831
01:17:28,233 --> 01:17:28,633
Well, thank you.

832
01:17:30,398 --> 01:17:34,281
I'll just add Alicia Hunt, the acting director of community development.

833
01:17:34,842 --> 01:17:39,085
Administratively, I did check sort of name lists of names.

834
01:17:39,125 --> 01:17:41,908
We have official lists of all the names of roads in the city.

835
01:17:41,928 --> 01:17:44,090
There's nothing else that starts with Mary.

836
01:17:44,590 --> 01:17:57,541
I had the opportunity to run it by our fire chief who has been with the city for an extremely long time, just asking if operationally he would like could foresee any confusion.

837
01:17:58,077 --> 01:18:00,679
around such a name and he thought it was perfectly fine.

838
01:18:01,180 --> 01:18:04,223
Just that we kind of checked those boxes for the board.

839
01:18:06,405 --> 01:18:07,045
Great, thank you.

840
01:18:07,626 --> 01:18:11,610
So it seems like a, I think a great suggestion.

841
01:18:11,630 --> 01:18:15,333
Do any board members have any concerns or questions about it?

842
01:18:15,353 --> 01:18:19,237
Okay, seeing none, let's move on to the next item.

843
01:18:20,418 --> 01:18:23,621
Let's talk about the blasting plan for a moment.

844
01:18:27,227 --> 01:18:31,450
So we did see your blasting plan, Mr. Champion.

845
01:18:31,490 --> 01:18:53,923
I'm wondering whether you would be able to either provide the city with a schedule of dates on which the blasting would or could occur, or alternatively provide a three day notice to the city when they're going to occur, just so that if any,

846
01:18:55,062 --> 01:19:01,647
anybody, residents in the city or neighbors, you know, call that the city's aware that this is going on?

847
01:19:03,188 --> 01:19:10,614
Yes, of course, and we'll email and flyer, and we'll be working very closely with Shria, who's adjacent to the property.

848
01:19:11,214 --> 01:19:21,902
Okay, so do you prefer, which of those two approaches do you prefer, just giving a three-day notice before it's going to happen, or do you think there'll be a calendar, an overall calendar you'll be able to provide?

849
01:19:25,172 --> 01:19:26,952
I'm thinking, just thinking through that.

850
01:19:26,972 --> 01:19:29,813
I think that we can, I think we'll provide both.

851
01:19:29,993 --> 01:19:37,435
So I think what we'll do is we're gonna provide a blasting schedule, and then weather's gonna augment that on us, and we'll update the schedule.

852
01:19:37,515 --> 01:19:41,976
So we will, you'll always have at least three days notice, but the schedule will be moving.

853
01:19:42,636 --> 01:19:43,316
Right, okay.

854
01:19:43,796 --> 01:19:50,258
I just wanna be clear that that would notice would be provided to the city, such that if the city wanted to use the reverse 911,

855
01:19:52,198 --> 01:19:53,919
system, they could do so.

856
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:59,483
If the school was in session, we would want to be able to notify the school.

857
01:19:59,963 --> 01:20:04,446
And frankly, people are working up there even if you know school is remote.

858
01:20:04,506 --> 01:20:07,707
That's our administrative headquarters for the school system.

859
01:20:09,168 --> 01:20:16,973
So that we should arrange that there's somebody official at the city that is notified with the intention of that

860
01:20:17,443 --> 01:20:23,047
notifying the school and doing a robocall to the broader area.

861
01:20:23,067 --> 01:20:28,711
And Alicia, would that be coordinated through your office or do you recommend somebody else?

862
01:20:29,492 --> 01:20:35,677
Instinctively, I think that we can, that we could perhaps have Annie be the point person.

863
01:20:36,317 --> 01:20:41,641
We'll just want to make internal arrangements for how that would work.

864
01:20:42,381 --> 01:20:42,642
But

865
01:20:45,052 --> 01:20:47,634
So let's say notice to the director of community development.

866
01:20:48,575 --> 01:20:49,476
Or her designee.

867
01:20:49,496 --> 01:20:51,738
Of course.

868
01:20:55,902 --> 01:20:58,804
And just to be clear, that's not necessarily coordination.

869
01:20:58,824 --> 01:21:05,610
I understand you're coordinating that with Shreya and with others in the fire department.

870
01:21:05,750 --> 01:21:10,334
It's just notice so that everybody, we can ensure that people are properly noticed.

871
01:21:11,095 --> 01:21:12,236
Fair enough.

872
01:21:16,463 --> 01:21:20,426
Any board members want to weigh in on the blasting plan or does that sound like a plan?

873
01:21:23,668 --> 01:21:30,912
The next item- With the blasting, there was, sorry, I always like to let the board members ask or speak first.

874
01:21:32,453 --> 01:21:40,218
The plan was a very extraordinarily detailed or long, but not detailed in terms of

875
01:21:41,478 --> 01:22:00,567
when it would happen like it talks about between certain hours on weekdays but not how many times a week minimum or maximum not times of year anything like that do we have that information yet so so yeah there's the

876
01:22:01,674 --> 01:22:03,495
There's two scenarios, right?

877
01:22:03,535 --> 01:22:06,518
There's one is what's the blasting plan for main drilling and blasting.

878
01:22:06,558 --> 01:22:09,780
And then, yes, we do have more detail on the blasting.

879
01:22:09,820 --> 01:22:15,864
So when I send you the schedule for the dates for blasting, it'll have that we have and

880
01:22:17,963 --> 01:22:26,050
I believe we have, let's see, the 25% of the days, there'll be two blasts, and 75% of the days, there's gonna be one blast.

881
01:22:26,610 --> 01:22:28,532
So when I send you the schedule, it'll depict that.

882
01:22:28,572 --> 01:22:36,339
The blasting plan that you sent is more of a regulatory-type document, which is probably why it's so long and says so little.

883
01:22:36,839 --> 01:22:45,907
But we can get more finite with the information we provide, with the dates of blasting, and then the notice on a three-day window.

884
01:22:47,592 --> 01:22:54,099
And was there ever a request from the city that the high school be on the pre-survey list?

885
01:22:54,659 --> 01:22:59,304
I note that it is extraordinarily close, but outside the 300-foot radius.

886
01:23:01,767 --> 01:23:02,988
We didn't know.

887
01:23:03,008 --> 01:23:04,029
We did not have a request.

888
01:23:07,818 --> 01:23:18,343
I apologize, that was sort of something that I realized yesterday when I was reviewing the blasting plan, just how close this actually is to our high school.

889
01:23:19,184 --> 01:23:23,206
Would you object to adding the high school to the preschool?

890
01:23:23,286 --> 01:23:24,406
No, I don't object.

891
01:23:25,587 --> 01:23:30,429
When I see the aerial of the size of the building, my heart skips a beat a little bit, but I don't object.

892
01:23:31,130 --> 01:23:31,490
Okay.

893
01:23:31,970 --> 01:23:35,692
Because I don't know what the exact, what they'll do to survey a building like that.

894
01:23:37,182 --> 01:23:41,707
But I don't have any objections, we don't want to cause any damage to the building.

895
01:23:41,787 --> 01:23:58,425
So I'll talk to Main Drilling and Blasting and find out what that inspection entails and then work with someone on getting in and through the building because I have a feeling, my gut would be that the survey of that building alone will take more than, will take a couple of days I would imagine.

896
01:23:59,219 --> 01:24:10,204
If it's any help, we do not have any current plans to put students in that building at least the end of September, I believe the end of October at this point.

897
01:24:11,324 --> 01:24:12,905
Okay, I'll put it on the list, thank you.

898
01:24:16,666 --> 01:24:18,607
Great, thank you, both of you.

899
01:24:18,627 --> 01:24:27,011
Moving on to the next item that we should discuss.

900
01:24:30,016 --> 01:24:45,803
So the city engineer, Tim McGivern mentioned that the right of way issue is still outstanding in terms of, you know, sign off from those, the grantees of those easements.

901
01:24:46,563 --> 01:24:59,189
And so I'd like to, Mr. Champion, you mentioned that you've been meeting with the abutters and can you just tell us a detail where that stands?

902
01:25:00,299 --> 01:25:10,722
So with 555 Winthrop, which is the easier of the two discussions, Shreya had mentioned, she sent me an email back saying, we'll review it.

903
01:25:10,862 --> 01:25:14,643
And I think it actually said, we'll review it and sign it.

904
01:25:14,964 --> 01:25:18,084
But if she has questions, we'd answer them, of course, and make sure.

905
01:25:18,165 --> 01:25:19,525
But she's comfortable with the project.

906
01:25:19,605 --> 01:25:22,486
I talked to her earlier today.

907
01:25:22,766 --> 01:25:25,687
And so I don't anticipate any challenges whatsoever.

908
01:25:27,127 --> 01:25:29,048
So that's the easier of the two.

909
01:25:30,578 --> 01:25:38,322
553 Winthrop has a little bit of history with the site because the gas line feeding that house and the water line was traversing the property.

910
01:25:39,042 --> 01:25:41,284
And it's registered land, so there's no adverse possession.

911
01:25:43,305 --> 01:25:47,027
So when we requested that they move the water line, we ended up in Superior Court.

912
01:25:48,327 --> 01:25:56,531
The prior city solicitor was also brought into the legal dispute, and we ended up in Land Court.

913
01:25:56,631 --> 01:25:59,033
Land Court wrote a

914
01:26:00,705 --> 01:26:01,705
It wasn't an order.

915
01:26:01,725 --> 01:26:03,926
I submitted it to the city.

916
01:26:03,966 --> 01:26:15,409
The land court had written back pretty much from what we viewed in it, that it was supporting the effort that you can't have adverse possession in registered land.

917
01:26:15,989 --> 01:26:24,451
So we sat with the prior city solicitor in his office with three lawyers, a developer, and a neighbor.

918
01:26:25,096 --> 01:26:35,300
And we agreed to relocate the waterline for the homeowner with the expectation that they would support the project.

919
01:26:35,720 --> 01:26:40,622
And then it was discussed that it wasn't anything that was in writing and whatnot.

920
01:26:40,682 --> 01:26:49,625
So about two months ago, we ran a new waterline for them and we connected their house with anticipation of these meetings.

921
01:26:50,388 --> 01:27:00,177
And then when we went to ask them to review the easement and the right-of-way extension, their response was slow.

922
01:27:00,497 --> 01:27:04,901
And then at the end of it, what they suggested was, well, get it approved.

923
01:27:05,682 --> 01:27:08,404
And I'm paraphrasing, but I believe these words are specific.

924
01:27:09,365 --> 01:27:16,952
Approved by the planning boards, and then they didn't want to sign the right-of-way prior to the planning board approving the plan.

925
01:27:18,248 --> 01:27:22,271
So we tried to encourage that it could be subject to the planning board approval.

926
01:27:23,291 --> 01:27:26,733
And they thought that it was just as easy to make the planning board approval subject to their approval.

927
01:27:27,114 --> 01:27:28,254
So we ended up on a dance.

928
01:27:30,756 --> 01:27:31,957
Okay.

929
01:27:32,737 --> 01:27:39,161
And I think we have the email that came in today.

930
01:27:39,582 --> 01:27:41,223
Lorena, would you be able to read that?

931
01:27:41,243 --> 01:27:41,783
Do you have that?

932
01:27:48,845 --> 01:27:53,007
from Maria C. Mangini and Stephan F. Amato.

933
01:27:54,548 --> 01:27:55,829
Is that the one that you're referring to?

934
01:27:55,849 --> 01:27:56,829
Yes.

935
01:28:00,371 --> 01:28:02,592
We live in 553 Winthrop Street.

936
01:28:04,773 --> 01:28:13,218
We kindly request that as abutters and part owner to the right of way in the proposed plan, our statement regarding the proposed Winthrop Estates be recorded.

937
01:28:14,479 --> 01:28:16,940
Recently, we were approached by Waypoint Inc.

938
01:28:17,292 --> 01:28:22,513
along with their attorneys and asked to sign an agreement that enables modifications to the right of way.

939
01:28:23,574 --> 01:28:34,156
While these proposed modifications appear to provide a positive safety-based benefit to us, we are not comfortable agreeing to any changes in writing at this time.

940
01:28:34,956 --> 01:28:45,639
We are also optimistic the state of the undeveloped land will change soon, as it has been an eyesore to the local community for well over a year.

941
01:28:46,594 --> 01:28:51,236
However, we remain concerned and are frustrated with the communication from Waypoint.

942
01:28:52,036 --> 01:29:03,960
Our consternation having originated in 2016 when their work team inadvertently cut our water lines and subsequently declared that they would not repair the damage.

943
01:29:04,601 --> 01:29:10,503
This left our family of five with the youngest, one years old at the time, without either drinking or cleaning water.

944
01:29:11,792 --> 01:29:18,996
The Massachusetts Department of Public Works stepped in to restore our water supply, and we remain entirely grateful for that.

945
01:29:19,096 --> 01:29:26,160
But there is still concern four years later, simply because we do not trust the Waypoint organization, nor do we trust their attorneys.

946
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:35,565
During the last discussion in mid-2019, Waypoint stated that they would move the water pipes at no cost to us

947
01:29:36,374 --> 01:29:39,196
as long as the development got the green light to move forward.

948
01:29:39,896 --> 01:29:41,897
That was the last communication on the topic.

949
01:29:42,558 --> 01:29:54,905
Toward the end of May 2020, in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, Tufts Construction showed up at our home with the same person from DPW who had assisted us in 2016.

950
01:29:55,625 --> 01:30:02,450
The project lead at Tufts asked if we were aware of the proposed work starting that day.

951
01:30:03,170 --> 01:30:04,811
There was no notice from anyone.

952
01:30:05,558 --> 01:30:07,958
Over the course of two weeks, from 7 a.m.

953
01:30:07,998 --> 01:30:11,539
to 4 p.m., we had Tufts construction on our front lawn.

954
01:30:12,119 --> 01:30:23,041
They were entirely respectful, but blasting through Granite and Boulder to cause a noise to the level that both my partner and I could not meaningly participate in any work meetings for two weeks again.

955
01:30:23,981 --> 01:30:32,883
During the pandemic, where we were working from home, it's not nice to have

956
01:30:35,424 --> 01:30:35,864
I'm sorry.

957
01:30:37,886 --> 01:30:47,454
During the pandemic, where working from home is not a nice to have, but a requirement, we are relieved that the waterline is no longer the issue at hand.

958
01:30:47,534 --> 01:30:55,260
However, after the work was done, we were left with a front lawn that is unleveled to a point of representing a safety concern.

959
01:30:55,961 --> 01:31:05,028
We had our landscape company provide an assessment and share that the front yard will require significant leveling since tufts simply tossed their back on top

960
01:31:05,825 --> 01:31:09,227
and it has settled rather unevenly over time.

961
01:31:09,947 --> 01:31:13,409
We didn't hear from Waypoint throughout the entire process.

962
01:31:13,890 --> 01:31:16,551
Again, we look forward to seeing the development move forward.

963
01:31:16,691 --> 01:31:34,141
However, in terms of coming to any agreement to modify the right of way, we will need Waypoint to propose a solution that includes compensatory damages for our front yard and beyond that, a solution to properly shield our property from the housing development work to come.

964
01:31:45,226 --> 01:31:49,929
Thank you, Lorena, for reading that.

965
01:31:51,790 --> 01:31:59,015
And I believe we've also received comments from the other grantee along the right-of-way at 555 Winthrop Street, so Lorena can read that as well.

966
01:32:00,216 --> 01:32:00,556
Thank you.

967
01:32:02,297 --> 01:32:05,539
So it's from Shreya Bhattacharya.

968
01:32:10,147 --> 01:32:16,250
I am a resident of 555 Winthrop Street and have been in dialogue with Mr. Ed Champey, the developer.

969
01:32:16,751 --> 01:32:23,214
I wanted to list some of the items that need to be done in this area before, during, and after the construction process.

970
01:32:24,115 --> 01:32:27,977
Install temporary sidewalks from Smith Lane to Lorain Road.

971
01:32:28,817 --> 01:32:30,378
Chris Donovan can elaborate.

972
01:32:31,178 --> 01:32:37,582
Install Jersey barriers from the gas station to Lorain Road prior to and during the blasting process.

973
01:32:38,449 --> 01:32:43,052
A smooth sidewalk beyond the Jersey barrier would be helpful to pedestrians.

974
01:32:44,132 --> 01:32:55,759
Street sweeping and sidewalk cleaning has already begun in front of the construction site, thanks to the collaborative efforts of Mr. Champy, the Medford Vocational Technical High School, and Chris Donovan.

975
01:32:56,940 --> 01:33:03,864
It would be great if this were to extend all the way to the front of the high school for the sake of neighborhood sidewalk beautification.

976
01:33:04,904 --> 01:33:06,065
Blasting of the site

977
01:33:07,265 --> 01:33:11,648
Some neighbors, including myself, were concerned about the blasting of the site.

978
01:33:12,349 --> 01:33:18,453
Mr. Champy has offered to put in additional seismic monitors on adjacent properties like mine.

979
01:33:19,454 --> 01:33:26,499
He also has agreed to share the safety plan approved by the company's geotech engineers and the Medford Fire Department.

980
01:33:27,720 --> 01:33:31,623
Pre-blasting survey, the developers will work with

981
01:33:32,075 --> 01:33:39,618
individuals who want to get their houses surveyed prior to blasting, as well as families who were not happy with the nature of the survey conducted.

982
01:33:41,238 --> 01:33:51,342
And post-construction, Mr. Champy has agreed to pave the private way that extends from 553 to Winthrop Street.

983
01:33:52,082 --> 01:33:56,204
There is a dirt road that extends beyond this road and connects to Franklin Road.

984
01:33:57,165 --> 01:34:04,648
Mr. Champy has offered to fill in this road with gravel as long as the property owners agree to it.

985
01:34:05,929 --> 01:34:09,570
Thank you for your time and the opportunity to voice our concerns and requests.

986
01:34:11,571 --> 01:34:17,094
And then I have one last comment from Rob Casano and family.

987
01:34:18,174 --> 01:34:20,495
They didn't see that, I think.

988
01:34:26,068 --> 01:34:28,589
They didn't include the address.

989
01:34:32,290 --> 01:34:37,332
I would like to weigh in with my thoughts and feedback since I did not attend this meeting.

990
01:34:37,912 --> 01:34:47,955
Just as a friendly reminder, many of us signed a petition back in 2019 regarding the 541 to 551 Winthrop Street development project.

991
01:34:48,556 --> 01:34:52,837
It clearly shows we all oppose the construction of the site and blasting.

992
01:34:53,440 --> 01:35:03,627
We also did not appreciate the lack of transparency from the developers and ever getting a straight answer from the city or the developer on what the actual development plans were.

993
01:35:04,468 --> 01:35:10,112
Unfortunately, the city engineering department approved the blasting, and now Tim has approved the new road.

994
01:35:10,713 --> 01:35:22,101
The developer believes that because the road is approved and that they have gone with the first phase of the blasting, that the neighborhood has no choice but to approve this development.

995
01:35:23,078 --> 01:35:34,300
My suggestion is the developer should be able to build a maximum of four homes and donate the rest to the city as a park or some type of community slash open space.

996
01:35:35,560 --> 01:35:47,522
How about the fact that with all the blasting and trees that need to come down to make this happen, how much the local wildlife, hawks, deers, bunnies, woodchucks, et cetera, is going to be displaced?

997
01:35:48,363 --> 01:35:50,543
One of the nice things of living in this

998
01:35:50,896 --> 01:35:53,276
part of Medford is the animal population.

999
01:35:54,077 --> 01:35:58,738
The city already has a major rat problem going on due to all the construction.

1000
01:35:59,338 --> 01:36:03,538
This project will most likely add to that problem that is ongoing.

1001
01:36:04,539 --> 01:36:12,020
Additional issues are parking, traffic, blasting, snow removal, amount of cars to get up the road and pest control.

1002
01:36:13,320 --> 01:36:16,481
With the morning traffic caused by the high school,

1003
01:36:17,821 --> 01:36:18,621
open parentheses.

1004
01:36:18,721 --> 01:36:26,725
I know we are in different times right now with COVID, but eventually let's hope things will be back to normal with students attending school, close parentheses.

1005
01:36:27,046 --> 01:36:32,849
It is already a daunting task to get out of our driveways and drive on Winthrop Street safely.

1006
01:36:33,309 --> 01:36:41,693
What will happen when this development adds more than 20 cars up that hill and they need to get out of their development complex every day?

1007
01:36:42,714 --> 01:36:45,435
It will back up traffic and create even more congestion.

1008
01:36:46,188 --> 01:36:54,374
We have enough from those commuters avoiding Route 93 and cutting through Winthrop from the surrounding towns and cities.

1009
01:36:54,934 --> 01:37:01,398
Additionally, I would hope we do not want another traffic light on Winthrop Street.

1010
01:37:02,359 --> 01:37:07,302
When all is said and done, this development will tax our infrastructure that is already depleting.

1011
01:37:08,223 --> 01:37:14,047
The developer will be far gone with money in their pocket, while the residents will be left without

1012
01:37:14,616 --> 01:37:18,177
with the fallout of more traffic, trash, noise, pollution, and flooding.

1013
01:37:18,797 --> 01:37:28,759
If every developer is going to come to Medford and continue to deforest the area and overbuild, we will lose the character of the city and change the entire landscape.

1014
01:37:29,899 --> 01:37:36,421
We must be patient and stick together and not approve this project as it will stand out like a sore thumb.

1015
01:37:36,861 --> 01:37:42,642
The last time the blasting occurred, I lost my entire heating system and the developer was nowhere to

1016
01:37:43,799 --> 01:37:45,780
to be found or assist with my inconvenience.

1017
01:37:46,421 --> 01:37:51,665
I had to call National Grid multiple times to help me, but everyone pointed the finger.

1018
01:37:51,825 --> 01:38:02,072
With the size of a project, we should demand accountability and make the developer pay an amount that can be held in escrow for future issues.

1019
01:38:03,273 --> 01:38:07,956
I had asked multiple questions during the meeting last month, and they never were addressed.

1020
01:38:08,835 --> 01:38:14,059
How are me and my family supposed to be on board with this when valid questions are not being addressed?

1021
01:38:14,360 --> 01:38:27,050
The fact that this entire project from the get-go has left us out of the conversation and is still not addressing many outstanding questions or concerns for me.

1022
01:38:27,931 --> 01:38:31,494
I would appreciate a reply on my many concerns.

1023
01:38:31,674 --> 01:38:36,338
I know Chris has been working to bring us all together on this, but I also don't support things

1024
01:38:37,388 --> 01:38:40,129
proceeding until all voices are truly heard and addressed.

1025
01:38:43,011 --> 01:38:43,771
Thank you, Lorena.

1026
01:38:44,411 --> 01:38:46,792
Mr. Champy, do you want to respond to any of those comments?

1027
01:38:48,613 --> 01:39:00,178
So I do recall the gentleman, I think it was at the neighborhood meeting or was at the last hearing, talking about the system repair and I had given my phone number and email for them to reach out to me.

1028
01:39:02,570 --> 01:39:07,213
And to be honest, we've got enough flyers that have gone out to the neighborhood that I'm surprised they couldn't reach us.

1029
01:39:07,253 --> 01:39:09,615
But I don't think he didn't get a return call.

1030
01:39:09,635 --> 01:39:11,677
I don't think he called us.

1031
01:39:13,519 --> 01:39:21,005
So with respect to some of his questions, I mean, I think some of them, I understand the sentiment and the history of the site.

1032
01:39:21,125 --> 01:39:29,512
And it's unfortunate how it transpired without reliving it.

1033
01:39:31,898 --> 01:39:33,279
I wish it didn't take place as well.

1034
01:39:34,600 --> 01:39:40,064
With regard to Shreya, I think that her comments speak for themselves.

1035
01:39:40,124 --> 01:39:42,346
So we're a regular dialogue.

1036
01:39:42,386 --> 01:39:47,230
And every time she's called us or we've called her or emailed or whatnot, it's worked out really well.

1037
01:39:47,290 --> 01:39:54,235
So what we're seeing is some neighbors that when, I don't think this is a difficult conversation.

1038
01:39:54,255 --> 01:39:56,416
I just think someone has to call us for us to know to call them.

1039
01:39:58,512 --> 01:40:08,978
With regard to the Amato's, I think it's just going to be a matter of, you know, their attorney was active in the conversations in City Hall that took place with the solicitor.

1040
01:40:09,058 --> 01:40:18,284
So he had suggested that we get approved and it's pending as a condition to get them to sign the easement.

1041
01:40:18,424 --> 01:40:20,985
And I think that that's the process we're going to have to take.

1042
01:40:24,707 --> 01:40:24,927
Thank you.

1043
01:40:24,947 --> 01:40:26,829
And I'll just make a couple of comments.

1044
01:40:27,973 --> 01:40:32,855
based on the comments that we heard from residents that were read.

1045
01:40:33,636 --> 01:40:41,159
One is that there are certain parameters that the Community Development Board needs to act within legal parameters.

1046
01:40:41,239 --> 01:40:50,043
So we cannot be responsible necessarily for whether development happens on a private parcel or not.

1047
01:40:50,803 --> 01:40:57,146
We are just tasked with making sure that all procedures are followed and that the design is as

1048
01:40:57,736 --> 01:41:07,939
strong as it can be, you know, protecting the safety of the community and trying to get as good a quality product as we can.

1049
01:41:08,599 --> 01:41:22,924
And then the second thing I would say is that we, neither can the board get in the middle of a private issue between a property owner and the developer.

1050
01:41:23,484 --> 01:41:26,545
So just to be clear, what the

1051
01:41:27,052 --> 01:41:34,017
that the public understands what the scope of what we can do and what our role and responsibility is in this whole process.

1052
01:41:39,802 --> 01:41:45,146
I also wanted to correct the record that that comment mentioned that Tim McGibbon had approved the road.

1053
01:41:45,206 --> 01:41:48,768
And I just wanted to correct the record that that is not something that has taken place.

1054
01:41:51,530 --> 01:41:52,911
And maybe if you would like to speak to that.

1055
01:41:55,818 --> 01:41:58,219
I think we have a member of the public who's been unmuted, Robin.

1056
01:41:58,239 --> 01:42:00,600
Good evening, actually.

1057
01:42:00,620 --> 01:42:02,941
My name is Robin Stein and I'm with KP Law.

1058
01:42:03,001 --> 01:42:07,704
We're special counsel to the board, so it's good to meet everyone this evening.

1059
01:42:07,724 --> 01:42:08,244
Thank you, Robin.

1060
01:42:09,084 --> 01:42:15,948
I had one question on, if it's okay, maybe you can just clarify for me, on this access easement issue.

1061
01:42:16,768 --> 01:42:25,212
Is the relocation integral to this approval or is it just something that the applicant and other folks would like to see happen for safety reasons?

1062
01:42:27,100 --> 01:42:32,261
I'm gonna, so I think too, for one fold, it's an extension of the right of way.

1063
01:42:32,281 --> 01:42:35,242
And we think it's a benefit safety wise.

1064
01:42:35,722 --> 01:42:38,042
And I'll let Tim speak to your other question too.

1065
01:42:38,922 --> 01:42:39,202
Okay.

1066
01:42:40,923 --> 01:42:47,984
Yeah, and I will say just Robin, just so you know, the board has asked, you know, did ask for some modifications to that right of way.

1067
01:42:48,304 --> 01:42:54,345
So to increase safety so that it wouldn't be coming out into the main road, but rather into the subdivision road.

1068
01:42:55,189 --> 01:42:59,452
and to grade it and improve the surfacing.

1069
01:43:00,713 --> 01:43:09,219
So I guess the question I have, is it going to be a, does it need to be, or is it will be a condition of the subdivision approval that it get relocated?

1070
01:43:09,239 --> 01:43:19,547
I believe it has to be so that, I mean, I don't think the project can move forward without it.

1071
01:43:19,747 --> 01:43:21,468
Someone, Tim.

1072
01:43:25,386 --> 01:43:45,331
If this board approved the subdivision, which is the creation of those lots, and the board would condition that approval on that agreement, then, you know, I understand we want it to get done, but if they don't get the agreement, then, right, you've conditioned the approval on the agreement.

1073
01:43:45,651 --> 01:43:51,492
So while, and my condition is sort of written that way too, and I admit that, but,

1074
01:43:52,605 --> 01:44:07,146
If nothing were done and the right-of-way wasn't moved, you basically are going to have a situation where you have an existing right-of-way that doesn't get relocated and it remains in the unsafe condition that it is today.

1075
01:44:07,887 --> 01:44:08,928
that's what would happen.

1076
01:44:09,308 --> 01:44:17,692
The idea is that while we're building this road and we can fix this problem, let's fix it and make that recommendation.

1077
01:44:17,973 --> 01:44:21,695
But we can't force two private parties to make an agreement with each other.

1078
01:44:21,715 --> 01:44:31,280
So I think, you know, after sort of having that discussion today, realizing that if you put that on a condition, then

1079
01:44:32,237 --> 01:44:38,321
then you're kind of getting put in the car before the horse a little bit because right they're saying that that we're okay with the development.

1080
01:44:39,082 --> 01:44:40,963
And we want to see it happen.

1081
01:44:41,643 --> 01:44:43,525
But we want all these things that are the

1082
01:44:44,797 --> 01:44:54,062
but then if we condition it or if the board conditions it, then it's forcing that private party to then make that agreement prior to your approval.

1083
01:44:55,503 --> 01:45:05,269
So I think, you know, the do nothing approach seems to work here on this particular matter with the understanding that the preference is to have that right of way fixed.

1084
01:45:05,349 --> 01:45:10,852
And I think both homeowners that use that driveway would agree that the way it is now

1085
01:45:11,418 --> 01:45:15,420
is not good, and the way that it's shown on the plans is good.

1086
01:45:15,901 --> 01:45:18,522
So I think they seem to understand that.

1087
01:45:18,662 --> 01:45:23,325
It's just a matter of tying this board up with something that it doesn't want to be tied up in.

1088
01:45:24,986 --> 01:45:25,766
So that's helpful.

1089
01:45:25,826 --> 01:45:32,830
I just wanted to clarify, because as you said, it's possible that it could not happen and that this project would go forward without it.

1090
01:45:33,050 --> 01:45:35,932
And so I just wanted to clarify my understanding of the condition.

1091
01:45:35,952 --> 01:45:36,572
So that's helpful.

1092
01:45:36,692 --> 01:45:36,993
Thank you.

1093
01:45:43,761 --> 01:45:48,603
So do you have a recommendation, Robin, on how to word that?

1094
01:45:48,903 --> 01:46:05,869
I mean, my preference is just that we're preserving through the plan the access of those abutters to the roadway with improvements.

1095
01:46:07,528 --> 01:46:14,670
So as I understand it, though, it's not going to be a condition of this approval that it get relocated.

1096
01:46:15,650 --> 01:46:21,691
Everyone would prefer that it get relocated, but this approval is not going to require that.

1097
01:46:21,731 --> 01:46:23,752
It's not integral to the approval, correct?

1098
01:46:28,853 --> 01:46:30,353
That may be.

1099
01:46:31,373 --> 01:46:31,713
I'm not sure.

1100
01:46:31,813 --> 01:46:33,174
I think that's what Tim was saying.

1101
01:46:34,599 --> 01:46:35,219
Tim, is that?

1102
01:46:35,299 --> 01:46:51,649
What I'm doing is I'm acknowledging the issue that was brought up today, that the board may not want to get involved in a private issue, which if you condition this development on that, then that's exactly what you're doing.

1103
01:46:51,669 --> 01:47:04,257
So I think if the applicant, I mean, I think you could simply say something along the lines that there'll be no interference.

1104
01:47:04,663 --> 01:47:11,485
Understanding that the board's not requiring the relocation, you just want to make sure that folks' interests are protected as they are.

1105
01:47:11,505 --> 01:47:15,746
I mean, you could say nothing.

1106
01:47:16,806 --> 01:47:26,228
If the board was inclined to, it could say something along the lines that, you know, there'll be no interference with any existing private rights in the property.

1107
01:47:27,869 --> 01:47:33,330
But I wanted to clarify what the board's goal was with the condition itself, which I think Tim has done.

1108
01:47:35,099 --> 01:47:36,180
Hi, this is Christy Dowd.

1109
01:47:36,280 --> 01:47:39,482
I just want to repeat back what I'm hearing as a board member.

1110
01:47:39,522 --> 01:47:50,028
I'm hearing that the present condition of that access is not in an ideal safe state.

1111
01:47:51,388 --> 01:47:54,150
And it's not the development that's creating that condition.

1112
01:47:55,130 --> 01:48:02,054
But by way of the development, it would improve that condition and maintain access to those houses.

1113
01:48:02,895 --> 01:48:04,496
So is that accurate?

1114
01:48:11,565 --> 01:48:12,585
I think that is accurate.

1115
01:48:12,605 --> 01:48:30,296
I think the question is how to word it, whether we should be silent on the issue or to include language that was mentioned about not interfering with existing rights.

1116
01:48:30,656 --> 01:48:37,340
Well, is it enough to say that the development, the only condition is that it maintains access to the

1117
01:48:40,532 --> 01:48:56,215
The thing I would want to add is that it, yes, it maintains access, but the big thing about the right-of-way to me was that it was emptying onto Winthrop Street, and now it's emptying onto the new road.

1118
01:48:56,575 --> 01:49:02,556
And I think that's, to me, that's the most important component of this, and that's the language I'd like to see.

1119
01:49:02,616 --> 01:49:07,457
Like, do whatever you want, but this right-of-way can't continue to

1120
01:49:11,449 --> 01:49:12,970
but I don't know how we would do that.

1121
01:49:15,171 --> 01:49:18,933
Well, that goes to my point, sorry for just jumping in, Andre.

1122
01:49:19,233 --> 01:49:19,813
No, go ahead.

1123
01:49:21,654 --> 01:49:33,960
You know, the board didn't put the driveway there, the driveway is there, it's an easement that was granted at some point in the past, I believe it was a very long time ago, in order to provide access to those houses up there.

1124
01:49:35,621 --> 01:49:40,123
So there becomes a question of what the board can and can't do in this situation.

1125
01:49:40,595 --> 01:49:42,958
I mean, that becomes relevant, right?

1126
01:49:44,239 --> 01:49:59,297
So while we all want that to be relocated and put on our new road, can we somehow stress that that's what the desire is, but without tying the project up?

1127
01:50:00,008 --> 01:50:02,729
with that private to private agreement?

1128
01:50:03,950 --> 01:50:07,391
Because that's what's going to happen if you put that as a condition of the project.

1129
01:50:08,972 --> 01:50:11,053
And does the board even have a right to do that, right?

1130
01:50:11,193 --> 01:50:12,994
I mean, that's also a fair question.

1131
01:50:14,774 --> 01:50:15,755
So right now it's a driveway.

1132
01:50:15,795 --> 01:50:17,716
It's not a, people use the word right of way.

1133
01:50:17,756 --> 01:50:19,136
It's a shared driveway.

1134
01:50:19,417 --> 01:50:23,358
It's not a, what do you call it?

1135
01:50:23,378 --> 01:50:24,179
A paper street.

1136
01:50:25,139 --> 01:50:27,000
There's no way parcel associated with it.

1137
01:50:27,612 --> 01:50:31,154
So it's traversing over private land for a private driveway.

1138
01:50:31,534 --> 01:50:32,034
That's what it is.

1139
01:50:32,455 --> 01:50:36,097
So right now that's on Winthrop Street and it's not ideal.

1140
01:50:37,938 --> 01:50:49,904
But the subdivision framework is basically allowing the creation of a brand new public way with the 10 lot building parcels, right?

1141
01:50:50,324 --> 01:50:54,326
And we wanna bring that driveway in on that to make it as safe as possible.

1142
01:50:56,609 --> 01:51:04,291
but it becomes down to one private company and one private landowner abutting each other.

1143
01:51:04,811 --> 01:51:11,994
And the city has a stance of, yes, please do that, that is safer, but even can the city do that?

1144
01:51:12,074 --> 01:51:13,354
So I think I've talked enough.

1145
01:51:13,734 --> 01:51:17,535
There's probably a way to frame this and make it work.

1146
01:51:17,555 --> 01:51:18,635
Excuse me, if I may.

1147
01:51:18,695 --> 01:51:19,876
So through the, oh, go ahead.

1148
01:51:20,836 --> 01:51:23,957
I think there's an important point that it has a domino effect because

1149
01:51:24,417 --> 01:51:32,424
If you look at sheet C1.0, the existing driveway interferes with the proposed wheelchair ramps at the corner.

1150
01:51:33,305 --> 01:51:43,234
So the two wheelchair ramps, one crossing the new road and one crossing Winthrop, may not be able to be designed appropriately if the driveway remains where it is today.

1151
01:51:46,117 --> 01:51:49,600
So through the chair, can I ask a question of the applicant?

1152
01:51:50,208 --> 01:51:51,428
Yes, please.

1153
01:51:52,289 --> 01:51:58,630
If the applicant Robin, actually, could you just could you just state again your full name and affiliation so that the public sure.

1154
01:51:59,450 --> 01:51:59,650
Sure.

1155
01:51:59,670 --> 01:52:00,751
My name is Robin Stein.

1156
01:52:01,491 --> 01:52:06,792
And I work at the law firm KP law and we are special counsel to the board in this matter.

1157
01:52:08,333 --> 01:52:09,813
So we're a lawyer for the board.

1158
01:52:12,274 --> 01:52:27,511
I guess my question before making this too complicated, because I was just trying to understand the board's goal with the condition, is whether the applicant's willing to have the condition say that the applicant needs to arrange for relocation as shown on the plan.

1159
01:52:34,055 --> 01:52:36,036
a little bit prior to answering that.

1160
01:52:36,856 --> 01:52:42,317
So we regrets putting a $40,000 waterline in without getting this in writing.

1161
01:52:43,898 --> 01:52:51,760
And now when I took notes, we're hearing this compensatory damages and we have to shield their property from the future development.

1162
01:52:52,540 --> 01:53:00,482
So I would have no problem with the requirement for that with our neighbor at 555 Winthrop, which is Shreya.

1163
01:53:03,092 --> 01:53:09,134
But I think that if I, what we're agreeing to now is incredible amount of leverage against our company.

1164
01:53:10,115 --> 01:53:11,395
And that's a concern.

1165
01:53:11,455 --> 01:53:16,017
I mean, the letter itself pretty much states that they want it, but they think that there's more for them to get.

1166
01:53:18,118 --> 01:53:20,578
And we are open to doing it.

1167
01:53:20,638 --> 01:53:23,640
We've been on the plans for, I think, three years.

1168
01:53:25,100 --> 01:53:28,401
And our neighbor has been at the meetings for those three years.

1169
01:53:30,662 --> 01:53:32,603
This is not new, Robin, just to,

1170
01:53:33,285 --> 01:53:34,586
give an explanation of time.

1171
01:53:35,886 --> 01:53:52,614
We're willing to, I think that, you know, if we wanna say that the developer is willing to put this in as long as it's agreed to within a certain period of time, I think that the neighbors would gladly sign it knowing that it's got an expiration date.

1172
01:53:52,854 --> 01:54:01,818
And I would do that rather than being at a negotiating table with someone who's just written a letter, which I wouldn't put that in writing personally.

1173
01:54:02,946 --> 01:54:05,369
that pretty much says they're gonna hold out to get a little more.

1174
01:54:14,478 --> 01:54:18,822
So Attorney Stein, do you have any recommendation for how to proceed in this matter?

1175
01:54:19,742 --> 01:54:24,225
Well, you know, I think that those are fair comments.

1176
01:54:25,106 --> 01:54:33,032
And that certainly, you know, so long as the board understands that ultimately, if they can't accomplish the private agreement, it's not going to get moved.

1177
01:54:33,532 --> 01:54:43,079
And that they may have to come back for modifications if there's something that implicates that, you certainly could put a condition in it just says that the developer shall relocate the easement.

1178
01:54:44,079 --> 01:54:48,763
I'm just looking at I want to get the terms right that the developer

1179
01:54:49,664 --> 01:55:16,978
shall as part of the project accomplish the proposed relocation of the access easement shown on, and I think it's sheet S2, subject to agreement of the easement holders, but that there should be no interference with the existing private easement rights, if that's something that everyone thinks is a fair condition.

1180
01:55:18,956 --> 01:55:19,956
That seems reasonable.

1181
01:55:19,976 --> 01:55:21,017
What do you think, Mr. Champy?

1182
01:55:21,637 --> 01:55:38,321
So what happens in the event that 553 just decides that they're going to hold up?

1183
01:55:38,341 --> 01:55:39,901
Attorney Stein, I'm going to throw that to you.

1184
01:55:39,921 --> 01:55:42,482
It's a legal question.

1185
01:55:43,642 --> 01:55:47,163
If it's not a requirement of the approval that it get moved,

1186
01:55:48,125 --> 01:55:49,186
then it doesn't move.

1187
01:55:51,087 --> 01:55:57,270
And that's why I asked, and I think Tim already addressed this question, is this an integral part or is it something that's preferred?

1188
01:55:57,331 --> 01:55:59,912
And I understand from Tim that it's something that's preferred.

1189
01:55:59,992 --> 01:56:05,675
So if it's not a condition of the approval, everyone just understands that it may not happen.

1190
01:56:07,016 --> 01:56:12,099
And if there are parts of this design that are dependent on that happening, they might have to modify.

1191
01:56:12,900 --> 01:56:15,001
But I can't really guess at that right now.

1192
01:56:15,561 --> 01:56:16,502
We would agree to that.

1193
01:56:18,159 --> 01:56:44,063
Did you say you would yes, I'm sorry that the zoom just got okay, so Something along the lines that the developer shall relocate the easement Shown as I'm just going to write this up proposed relocated access easement a1 And then we can always proofread it later on Plan sheet

1194
01:56:51,244 --> 01:57:17,903
s2 and we'll say subject to agreement of the easement holders yes oh i lost my page i'm sorry subject to the agreement of the easement holders and shall and shall not

1195
01:57:20,898 --> 01:57:25,399
interfere with existing easement rights?

1196
01:57:26,680 --> 01:57:26,920
Yes.

1197
01:57:28,781 --> 01:57:29,021
Okay.

1198
01:57:29,041 --> 01:57:31,121
So something along those lines, something to that effect.

1199
01:57:32,182 --> 01:57:32,322
Right.

1200
01:57:32,342 --> 01:57:35,143
If that works for folks 10, if that works for you.

1201
01:57:35,703 --> 01:57:38,944
In the event that it's a stalemate, we replant a crosswalk.

1202
01:57:40,652 --> 01:57:45,256
That all makes sense and that's where my mind was headed to, that we're working.

1203
01:57:45,436 --> 01:57:59,809
And just to be clear, if for some reason agreement falls through and we all don't get what we want in the situation, then it would have to be approved through a field change, through the board, a redesign, how we make that crossing work from Lorraine and all that.

1204
01:58:00,409 --> 01:58:02,191
So, definitely people.

1205
01:58:03,172 --> 01:58:06,895
Sorry, Tim, could you explain that process again if we're moving the crosswalk?

1206
01:58:07,402 --> 01:58:27,673
I would say that if a plan set gets approved tonight, and that agreement doesn't go through with the private-to-private agreement there with the grantee, then you would have to submit for a field change for a redesign, leaving the driveway where it is, and then seeing what we can do about that, carossing over to Lorraine.

1207
01:58:27,693 --> 01:58:28,753
Does that make sense?

1208
01:58:28,813 --> 01:58:29,934
Okay, yeah, that makes sense.

1209
01:58:30,334 --> 01:58:31,175
So it would be a field change.

1210
01:58:31,635 --> 01:58:37,078
And just to be clear, we think it's a better project with the extension on the right-of-way.

1211
01:58:37,608 --> 01:58:39,690
Yeah, I think we all kind of agree that.

1212
01:58:39,730 --> 01:58:41,211
I think the grantees also know that too.

1213
01:58:41,811 --> 01:58:45,574
It's just a matter of the business of doing business per se in this world.

1214
01:58:45,934 --> 01:58:46,695
We appreciate that.

1215
01:58:50,473 --> 01:58:51,893
No, no, I was just recognizing you.

1216
01:58:52,013 --> 01:58:53,094
Go ahead.

1217
01:58:53,114 --> 01:58:53,854
Sorry, I apologize.

1218
01:58:53,874 --> 01:58:56,214
It's so hard on Zoom to get attentions.

1219
01:58:57,635 --> 01:59:00,355
I just want to make sure that I'm being accurate in what I said.

1220
01:59:00,515 --> 01:59:07,377
It's just the area identified as proposed relocated access to A1, where it says extension of right of way.

1221
01:59:07,417 --> 01:59:08,317
Is that already there?

1222
01:59:08,337 --> 01:59:11,758
It's not already there.

1223
01:59:12,898 --> 01:59:17,339
So I just want to make sure that the condition is clear as to what the developer has to do.

1224
01:59:17,359 --> 01:59:19,240
Maybe you can help on the engineering side of that.

1225
01:59:19,853 --> 01:59:23,975
Sir, it's the extension of the right-of-way is the new area.

1226
01:59:25,135 --> 01:59:28,536
Oh, OK.

1227
01:59:29,156 --> 01:59:36,639
So you're getting rid of the 955-foot proposed relocated access easement and creating the extension of the right-of-way.

1228
01:59:39,620 --> 01:59:41,741
I don't follow you.

1229
01:59:41,861 --> 01:59:44,102
Can you share your screen, please?

1230
01:59:45,692 --> 01:59:54,375
I can't because I'm on, I can tell you it's, I can't because I have it on a different system than the Zoom, but it's sheet S2.0.

1231
01:59:54,595 --> 01:59:55,716
I, let's see.

1232
02:00:01,858 --> 02:00:02,838
Maybe you can share it.

1233
02:00:03,838 --> 02:00:04,499
I apologize.

1234
02:00:04,959 --> 02:00:08,880
You know what, I don't have, I have the sheets that I was supposed to pull because it was a Dropbox link.

1235
02:00:09,102 --> 02:00:14,045
Do you think we could, I think we all agree on what we're trying to accomplish.

1236
02:00:14,065 --> 02:00:18,587
Do you think we could wordsmith the final language?

1237
02:00:19,387 --> 02:00:19,868
Sure.

1238
02:00:20,768 --> 02:00:24,270
Yeah, we can make the final decision just subject to the chair's final review and approval.

1239
02:00:24,310 --> 02:00:26,111
I think we're all on the same page about what's going to happen.

1240
02:00:26,551 --> 02:00:28,372
And we can clarify it later.

1241
02:00:28,412 --> 02:00:28,732
That's fine.

1242
02:00:29,333 --> 02:00:29,753
That's great.

1243
02:00:29,793 --> 02:00:30,133
Thank you.

1244
02:00:30,413 --> 02:00:33,855
I appreciate your counsel, Attorney Stein.

1245
02:00:35,476 --> 02:00:36,016
Happy to help.

1246
02:00:37,417 --> 02:00:37,497
OK.

1247
02:00:38,032 --> 02:00:38,933
All right, thank you, everybody.

1248
02:00:39,373 --> 02:00:45,216
So a couple of other issues to cover.

1249
02:00:46,117 --> 02:00:57,783
The fire chief had a conversation with community development staff and myself about a couple of concerns and recommendations that he was making.

1250
02:00:57,823 --> 02:01:02,165
So I want to just acknowledge those and try to address them here.

1251
02:01:02,966 --> 02:01:03,766
One was he,

1252
02:01:06,768 --> 02:01:13,785
reiterated that he'd like that right-of-way to be as wide as possible and paved.

1253
02:01:14,728 --> 02:01:18,770
I think you mentioned that you were intending to pave it now, is that correct?

1254
02:01:18,790 --> 02:01:18,850
Yes.

1255
02:01:18,990 --> 02:01:22,892
Assuming we get the extension, we're paving it.

1256
02:01:24,633 --> 02:01:25,273
Okay, great.

1257
02:01:25,733 --> 02:01:32,856
And then, obviously, he had recommended sprinklering each of the houses.

1258
02:01:32,956 --> 02:01:38,939
Now, you are not required to do that, so that's just his preference that he wanted to weigh in on.

1259
02:01:39,379 --> 02:01:43,601
And then the final thing, which is probably his strongest recommendation,

1260
02:01:44,232 --> 02:01:48,474
was to get rid of the island that's there.

1261
02:01:48,834 --> 02:01:58,818
He has concerns about the turning radius and being able to maneuver fire trucks in there, especially if people are parked in front of their homes.

1262
02:02:00,418 --> 02:02:03,480
So could you address that issue?

1263
02:02:03,900 --> 02:02:04,200
Sure.

1264
02:02:04,320 --> 02:02:06,381
On the island, my

1265
02:02:07,291 --> 02:02:14,735
From my understanding, the subdivision rules and regs require it for the road for the cul-de-sac, so I think it would require relief.

1266
02:02:15,996 --> 02:02:29,684
So what I would suggest in that case would be that if we can approve the plan in its current state, I'll reappear for the relief to remove the island.

1267
02:02:30,625 --> 02:02:36,208
Therefore, that way if someone appeals it, I'm not stuck in appeals court because of an island.

1268
02:02:39,996 --> 02:02:45,981
We don't believe that that is a requirement to have the island.

1269
02:02:47,322 --> 02:02:48,283
Well, then that would be easy.

1270
02:02:48,323 --> 02:02:49,063
I'll take it right off.

1271
02:02:49,704 --> 02:02:55,508
I'm almost, I'm, Wayne Kiefner is on the call and he's muted.

1272
02:02:56,970 --> 02:02:59,111
He may know it's been on there so long.

1273
02:02:59,191 --> 02:03:06,797
I, to be honest, I, I forget, but so I guess we can make the, if it doesn't require relief, I'll remove the island.

1274
02:03:07,558 --> 02:03:07,778
Okay.

1275
02:03:09,285 --> 02:03:11,166
There may be some middle ground with that.

1276
02:03:11,826 --> 02:03:13,467
Sorry.

1277
02:03:13,747 --> 02:03:14,147
Go ahead.

1278
02:03:14,167 --> 02:03:15,648
I was about to say the same thing.

1279
02:03:15,888 --> 02:03:27,152
I'm wondering if there's a design for an island that would satisfy both the fire chief and the fact that I think it looks a lot nicer with the island.

1280
02:03:30,153 --> 02:03:34,435
Yeah, it looks like the overall diameter is 80 feet of the largest circle.

1281
02:03:35,175 --> 02:03:38,377
So it's similar to roundabouts that are on the street.

1282
02:03:38,557 --> 02:03:46,020
And in those cases, the median could be, the center island could be reduced with a multiple piece to it.

1283
02:03:46,360 --> 02:03:47,421
So it's kind of a hybrid.

1284
02:03:48,141 --> 02:03:53,604
Yeah, so we could do like a paver that ramps up in a three foot section around it with a planting in the middle.

1285
02:03:54,384 --> 02:04:01,107
To be honest, I don't have a, I think that that would be kind of cool, but I don't have a position on it.

1286
02:04:04,880 --> 02:04:30,763
You know we drew the road so they would adhere to the specs, but I really when it comes down to it I'm open to anything So and obviously I I communicated to the chief to that I thought aesthetically the island looked better, but he did feel that That he'd have some some issues with this with his trucks, so I want to take that as

1287
02:04:31,264 --> 02:04:32,565
of that seriously.

1288
02:04:32,925 --> 02:04:34,265
What kind of issues were they, Andre?

1289
02:04:34,305 --> 02:04:43,750
Because, you know, there are like programs you can use to, you know, like it's called auto turn and you can just show the chief that.

1290
02:04:45,750 --> 02:04:48,472
His largest ladder truck is huge.

1291
02:04:51,833 --> 02:04:51,993
Right.

1292
02:04:52,033 --> 02:04:59,877
This is something that might require a separate sit down conversation with the chief at some point to go over these kinds of design issues.

1293
02:05:01,245 --> 02:05:03,946
which I would be interested in doing.

1294
02:05:04,026 --> 02:05:11,089
But I think for tonight, it would be hard to get to that point.

1295
02:05:11,129 --> 02:05:19,352
So I guess, you know, if there is, I like the idea of having some kind of, you know, treatment where you can see,

1296
02:05:21,444 --> 02:05:37,177
you know, would not just be 80 feet of or so of asphalt, but it would have some treatment in the middle that would make it more aesthetically pleasing, but would not interfere if necessary with a truck that would have to make, you know, that might have to drive over it.

1297
02:05:38,878 --> 02:05:46,344
So I'm open to whatever the, wherever that discussion lands, I'm fine with it.

1298
02:05:46,364 --> 02:05:46,464
Okay.

1299
02:05:48,903 --> 02:05:56,884
So is there agreement, though, that, you know, Tim, I think you, there's no requirement, as far as you know, to have that island there.

1300
02:05:56,904 --> 02:05:57,745
Is that correct?

1301
02:05:58,585 --> 02:05:59,265
Yeah, I looked into it.

1302
02:05:59,325 --> 02:06:00,165
It's on a graphic.

1303
02:06:00,785 --> 02:06:04,806
And it talks about widths with an island.

1304
02:06:04,866 --> 02:06:06,506
So I'm pretty sure they're minimum.

1305
02:06:07,246 --> 02:06:11,927
So it could be interpreted that the regs don't require it, like you were saying.

1306
02:06:12,447 --> 02:06:15,988
I didn't see it explicitly in black and white that said an island is required.

1307
02:06:18,312 --> 02:06:19,893
But it's in the diagrams, right?

1308
02:06:19,913 --> 02:06:22,614
And in the diagrams, I mean, that's a valid point.

1309
02:06:22,634 --> 02:06:26,236
So someone could interpret it as it's shown in the diagrams, therefore it's required.

1310
02:06:26,536 --> 02:06:27,817
So, you know, point taken.

1311
02:06:31,118 --> 02:06:32,699
But we're flexible on that.

1312
02:06:32,719 --> 02:06:32,999
Okay.

1313
02:06:33,159 --> 02:06:42,903
Yeah, we have not required islands, particularly because of the, you know, the fire chief has often weighs in in this way on such projects.

1314
02:06:43,844 --> 02:06:46,585
So we don't anticipate a problem, but I

1315
02:06:47,108 --> 02:07:07,245
I think if we could word it in such a way that we could say there could be some kind of treatment in the middle that would not obstruct emergency vehicles, that would be.

1316
02:07:07,265 --> 02:07:13,690
And then we can kind of leave that for the design afterwards for you guys to work out.

1317
02:07:15,562 --> 02:07:33,112
So if we could word it so that it's stated that the island can be reduced in size, almost down to, can essentially go to zero, but at that point, if there's still a concern, it's not our concern.

1318
02:07:34,753 --> 02:07:34,933
Right.

1319
02:07:36,213 --> 02:07:37,234
Yeah, I think that's right.

1320
02:07:37,494 --> 02:07:43,317
There could be, maybe we should word it that there could be no island, but that there will be,

1321
02:07:46,218 --> 02:07:57,328
you know, further discussion with the fire chief and the city engineer about a mutually acceptable, you know, treatment for the cul-de-sac.

1322
02:07:59,930 --> 02:08:02,873
But not requiring anything to be there.

1323
02:08:03,534 --> 02:08:06,056
So, you know, worst case, there's no island.

1324
02:08:07,337 --> 02:08:12,562
And is that a discussion between the fire chief and Tim McGibbon?

1325
02:08:14,513 --> 02:08:17,295
Yeah, I mean, the fire chief's position, I believe, is no island.

1326
02:08:17,395 --> 02:08:18,256
That's his preference.

1327
02:08:18,436 --> 02:08:34,387
So, you know, I think the question is whether there could be a little bit more of, you know, something more aesthetically pleasing, worked out with you and Tim and the fire chief, that fire chief would find acceptable.

1328
02:08:35,327 --> 02:08:40,751
My experience with the fire chief has always been cordial and professional, but he's unwavering.

1329
02:08:41,372 --> 02:08:41,532
Yeah.

1330
02:08:43,947 --> 02:08:48,049
I'm up for following anybody that wants to go into his office with me and talk about it.

1331
02:08:48,109 --> 02:08:49,669
But I anticipate we're going to have pavement.

1332
02:08:50,270 --> 02:08:50,450
Yeah.

1333
02:08:51,270 --> 02:08:51,530
OK.

1334
02:08:51,950 --> 02:08:52,891
Mr. Chair, if I may?

1335
02:08:53,651 --> 02:08:54,511
Yeah, Mr. Blake.

1336
02:08:56,372 --> 02:09:04,075
I defer to the chief on all safety matters, but I thought it might be useful to the board and the residents in attendance, just a point of information.

1337
02:09:04,795 --> 02:09:11,618
There's a roundabout in Melrose at Green and Howard with a 16-foot traveling lane around.

1338
02:09:11,798 --> 02:09:13,699
And then it has a rumble strip.

1339
02:09:14,662 --> 02:09:20,750
outside the center island, which makes it a total of 25 feet from the center island to the outer edge.

1340
02:09:20,990 --> 02:09:23,012
So it's on the intersection of two major streets.

1341
02:09:23,032 --> 02:09:27,237
So I think there's definitely some wiggle room here.

1342
02:09:29,139 --> 02:09:31,222
I'm happy to participate.

1343
02:09:32,291 --> 02:09:33,452
Okay, thank you.

1344
02:09:33,652 --> 02:09:48,325
And I suggest just if it's helpful, and again, subject to final approval, a condition that the applicant shall remove the proposed cul-de-sac island and we'll work with the fire chief and director of engineering to identify if possible an alternative treatment for the cul-de-sac.

1345
02:09:48,725 --> 02:09:49,806
That sounds great.

1346
02:09:50,867 --> 02:09:52,108
Is that acceptable to everyone?

1347
02:09:53,249 --> 02:09:55,351
Board members, is that acceptable to all of you?

1348
02:09:56,825 --> 02:09:57,165
Yes.

1349
02:09:57,745 --> 02:09:58,966
Andre, it's Dave.

1350
02:09:59,626 --> 02:10:09,108
I just want to make sure that we're conveying to the chief that if this is true, that it's the board's strong recommendation that there is some treatment.

1351
02:10:09,128 --> 02:10:11,768
I just want to make sure we're really on board with this thing.

1352
02:10:14,409 --> 02:10:15,909
And he understands that.

1353
02:10:15,929 --> 02:10:18,970
I don't want to just fall by the wayside.

1354
02:10:21,977 --> 02:10:22,918
I think that's a good point.

1355
02:10:23,318 --> 02:10:27,141
And again, when I met with him, I communicated that.

1356
02:10:27,221 --> 02:10:30,523
But I think it might be helpful for other board members to communicate that as well.

1357
02:10:30,583 --> 02:10:39,569
And perhaps it may require a dialogue separate from any particular project.

1358
02:10:41,951 --> 02:10:42,271
Thank you.

1359
02:10:43,192 --> 02:10:46,454
I do see Doug Carr with his hand raised.

1360
02:10:46,594 --> 02:10:47,875
Could he be unmuted?

1361
02:10:59,139 --> 02:11:03,421
I could just say a few words about that island issue.

1362
02:11:04,481 --> 02:11:16,726
As somebody who has seen them successfully designed all over the place, from assembly row and a lot of places around Medford, it's not a safety issue.

1363
02:11:16,787 --> 02:11:24,890
The standard civil engineering diagrams and turning radiuses that will handle any fire truck and to have

1364
02:11:25,673 --> 02:11:30,175
100 feet of pavement in the middle of that development would look terrible.

1365
02:11:30,876 --> 02:11:33,117
I think you've got to fight hard for the aesthetics here.

1366
02:11:33,517 --> 02:11:34,698
It's not a safety issue.

1367
02:11:34,718 --> 02:11:36,098
This is a desire.

1368
02:11:36,118 --> 02:11:44,082
There's no safety issue that I can see, because I've seen that design a dozen times in a dozen different cities over the last 10 years.

1369
02:11:44,963 --> 02:11:53,247
And I just think it would be unwise for the neighborhood, the small cluster, whole cycle created to have this

1370
02:11:54,010 --> 02:11:59,473
landing strip like the Logan Airport in the middle of it, where it really needs to be softened.

1371
02:11:59,493 --> 02:12:02,535
This is a quality of the development issue.

1372
02:12:02,575 --> 02:12:04,336
These are well-designed buildings.

1373
02:12:05,056 --> 02:12:06,978
It's got a lot of great landscaping to have.

1374
02:12:07,778 --> 02:12:10,920
This crater in the middle of it, I think, is a big mistake.

1375
02:12:14,402 --> 02:12:15,202
Thank you, Mr. Carr.

1376
02:12:16,103 --> 02:12:20,966
I would also add that, to me, it's a bit of a sustainability issue, too.

1377
02:12:24,220 --> 02:12:37,985
that much more black asphalt just heating up that area, not contributing to infiltration and creating more rainwater down the slope and all that.

1378
02:12:40,126 --> 02:12:43,667
I tend to agree that this is something this project should have.

1379
02:12:45,955 --> 02:12:47,737
I'm not sure I'm on, yeah.

1380
02:12:48,117 --> 02:12:50,379
Yeah, I did express that sentiment as well for the chief.

1381
02:12:50,459 --> 02:12:57,745
I'm just sort of maybe feeling that there needs to be language just a little stronger in support of it or, you know.

1382
02:12:58,846 --> 02:13:05,932
The removal of it is, there's a condition or another review, I don't know.

1383
02:13:06,773 --> 02:13:12,238
I feel like if we get rid of it tonight and then we say maybe we'll put it back, it could be lost for good.

1384
02:13:16,560 --> 02:13:17,040
Well, maybe we could.

1385
02:13:17,060 --> 02:13:19,921
Between the rules and regulations, you're welcome to keep it in.

1386
02:13:24,522 --> 02:13:26,583
Do other board members have a strong opinion?

1387
02:13:35,165 --> 02:13:42,708
I think for the purpose of moving this forward, I think we should stick to Attorney Stein's recommendation, but add

1388
02:13:46,293 --> 02:14:03,905
I'm happy to try to wordsmith it a little bit more and maybe add some language about permeability and sustainability, because I think that we could, you know, at worst have a surface level solution that is aesthetically sets the pavement apart and is permeable.

1389
02:14:04,165 --> 02:14:05,466
So I think we could at least do that.

1390
02:14:05,486 --> 02:14:07,767
Yeah.

1391
02:14:08,888 --> 02:14:10,870
I suppose it could also not be a tree.

1392
02:14:10,890 --> 02:14:15,853
It could be just like plantings that in worst case scenario, they could just be

1393
02:14:16,604 --> 02:14:17,004
run over.

1394
02:14:17,024 --> 02:14:19,866
Right.

1395
02:14:20,546 --> 02:14:20,726
Yes.

1396
02:14:20,826 --> 02:14:22,507
So we would agreeing with that.

1397
02:14:22,527 --> 02:14:23,468
Excuse me, Mr. Chair.

1398
02:14:24,168 --> 02:14:24,408
Yes.

1399
02:14:24,649 --> 02:14:24,889
Green.

1400
02:14:25,309 --> 02:14:26,009
Agreeing with that.

1401
02:14:26,290 --> 02:14:31,973
Um, we'll, we'll, we will agree in the decision that in the island, there'll be no transformers, no electrical.

1402
02:14:32,873 --> 02:14:36,215
Um, so if we keep all that out of there, low growth would be fine.

1403
02:14:36,255 --> 02:14:39,117
And if you drove over it, you wouldn't do any damage other than to the plants.

1404
02:14:44,340 --> 02:14:44,400
Um,

1405
02:14:45,528 --> 02:15:06,179
Okay, well, I think I... Can I just confirm then, just so folks are on the same page, that the condition will read along the lines that the applicant shall remove the proposed cul-de-sac island and work with the fire chief and engineering director to identify an alternative treatment for the cul-de-sac to be installed by the applicant?

1406
02:15:07,400 --> 02:15:11,702
I would say that we're gonna augment the island and not remove it.

1407
02:15:12,542 --> 02:15:13,863
Okay, so the applicant shall

1408
02:15:14,967 --> 02:15:23,929
augment the proposed cul-de-sac island and work with the fire chief and engineering director to identify an alternative treatment for the cul-de-sac to be installed by the applicant.

1409
02:15:24,869 --> 02:15:34,552
And I would say, could you insert language in there that would say permeable and also that would not obstruct emergency vehicles?

1410
02:15:35,452 --> 02:15:38,132
Yeah, no infrastructure, no exposed infrastructure.

1411
02:15:38,993 --> 02:15:40,693
Okay, so we'll say, give me one second here.

1412
02:15:42,647 --> 02:15:50,493
Identify a permeable alternative treatment for the cul-de-sac to be installed by the applicant.

1413
02:15:51,754 --> 02:15:57,658
There shall be no infrastructure installed.

1414
02:15:57,918 --> 02:15:59,199
No exposed infrastructure.

1415
02:16:01,621 --> 02:16:02,822
Is that satisfactory?

1416
02:16:02,842 --> 02:16:08,666
There should be no exposed infrastructure installed in the area of the cul-de-sac?

1417
02:16:10,888 --> 02:16:14,991
To account for the trees, you could say no vertical elements over a certain height.

1418
02:16:18,394 --> 02:16:23,578
I think we should keep this as simple as possible and maybe not talk about the infrastructure.

1419
02:16:23,758 --> 02:16:33,006
His concern is about obstructing emergency vehicles, and we should just say a permeable cul-de-sac island.

1420
02:16:33,026 --> 02:16:36,088
I like what you said, Attorney Stein, so stick with your words.

1421
02:16:37,289 --> 02:16:39,751
That shall not obstruct emergency vehicles.

1422
02:16:42,930 --> 02:16:57,698
Okay, so it'll say the applicant shall augment their proposed cul-de-sac island and work with the fire chief and engineering director to identify a permeable alternative treatment for the cul-de-sac that shall not obstruct emergency vehicles and will be installed by the applicant.

1423
02:16:58,158 --> 02:16:59,719
Yes, that sounds perfect.

1424
02:16:59,839 --> 02:17:00,160
Thank you.

1425
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:01,320
Thank you.

1426
02:17:01,340 --> 02:17:07,964
Great.

1427
02:17:08,524 --> 02:17:08,844
All right.

1428
02:17:10,165 --> 02:17:11,066
Making progress.

1429
02:17:15,835 --> 02:17:19,759
Let me just see if there's any other issues we needed to cover here.

1430
02:17:19,779 --> 02:17:19,819
So.

1431
02:17:37,366 --> 02:17:52,050
All right, just to also be clear that this project is subject to linkage fees per the city of Medford zoning ordinance chapter 94, section 94-382 per building commissioner Paul Mochi's letter to the board dated May 14th, 2019.

1432
02:17:52,450 --> 02:18:01,532
Andre, is there going to be a moment for us to give comments based on Ed's presentation?

1433
02:18:03,094 --> 02:18:04,354
Yeah, let's do that now.

1434
02:18:04,735 --> 02:18:15,278
I think I just wanted to make sure we attacked the big things that we're going to have a lot of discussion so that the meeting wouldn't go on too long.

1435
02:18:17,699 --> 02:18:18,859
Would you like to speak now, Klaus?

1436
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:22,360
Sure, and I'll be brief.

1437
02:18:24,641 --> 02:18:28,182
Ed, are all the proposed sidewalks in the project concrete?

1438
02:18:28,982 --> 02:18:29,182
Yes.

1439
02:18:30,243 --> 02:18:30,303
OK.

1440
02:18:32,203 --> 02:18:34,024
Are there sidewalks up around the cul-de-sac?

1441
02:18:34,865 --> 02:18:35,105
Yes.

1442
02:18:35,905 --> 02:18:38,727
On the entirety of the cul-de-sac, on both sides?

1443
02:18:40,148 --> 02:18:41,249
Let me double check.

1444
02:18:46,012 --> 02:18:48,753
Yes, there are.

1445
02:18:49,034 --> 02:18:49,174
OK.

1446
02:18:52,296 --> 02:18:58,119
There are street trees that were left out of the renderings.

1447
02:19:01,008 --> 02:19:02,269
you know approximately how many?

1448
02:19:03,369 --> 02:19:14,975
So there was only one, on the one view where you and I had discussed not having the houses and seeing the wall, that's the only rendering I took them out of.

1449
02:19:14,995 --> 02:19:16,475
Okay.

1450
02:19:16,616 --> 02:19:19,657
So that it wouldn't, because it hid the wall when they were in it, so I edited it.

1451
02:19:19,677 --> 02:19:21,038
Okay.

1452
02:19:22,058 --> 02:19:24,059
So there's one street tree then?

1453
02:19:24,739 --> 02:19:28,721
No, there's multiple, but it's as per the code.

1454
02:19:28,761 --> 02:19:29,882
I'm looking at the plan now.

1455
02:19:31,603 --> 02:19:47,250
Hold on one second.

1456
02:19:47,270 --> 02:19:47,910
I think there's 10.

1457
02:19:48,710 --> 02:19:48,950
Great.

1458
02:19:50,251 --> 02:19:57,794
And my final comment is the streetlights.

1459
02:19:59,415 --> 02:20:00,435
Is that a city standard?

1460
02:20:01,137 --> 02:20:01,458
It is.

1461
02:20:02,278 --> 02:20:03,840
Okay.

1462
02:20:05,522 --> 02:20:08,285
Are we seeing that in other residential areas of the city?

1463
02:20:08,666 --> 02:20:11,089
They look like the streetlights we have in Medford Square.

1464
02:20:11,109 --> 02:20:16,615
The streetlights on the plan were not standard.

1465
02:20:16,835 --> 02:20:21,160
Are they intended to be maintained by the city or is the

1466
02:20:22,970 --> 02:20:26,891
Uh, so we, who's taking care of those?

1467
02:20:26,971 --> 02:20:31,673
Cause they were not city, Medford city standard street lights.

1468
02:20:32,133 --> 02:20:42,777
Oh, then there's, there's a, then there's an error in one of the pages then, because we had gotten, is it the wiring commissioner or wires inspector of wires?

1469
02:20:43,537 --> 02:20:46,238
We got, we got a spec from the inspector of wires.

1470
02:20:46,578 --> 02:20:51,300
So we'll include that with the plan, but could you tell me what year you got that spec from him?

1471
02:20:52,633 --> 02:20:54,314
I'll find out.

1472
02:20:54,855 --> 02:20:56,656
It was at least a year ago.

1473
02:20:57,116 --> 02:21:06,402
We replaced all Cobra heads, and we updated all the streetlights in Medford Square 18 months ago.

1474
02:21:08,203 --> 02:21:09,084
Well, I'm happy.

1475
02:21:09,104 --> 02:21:17,509
So the point that I make is we didn't love the spec that we got, so we'd be happy to look at the new one.

1476
02:21:19,720 --> 02:21:26,924
We'll make sure that the lighting will be standard with current city lighting standards.

1477
02:21:27,004 --> 02:21:27,224
Yes.

1478
02:21:27,905 --> 02:21:31,187
Is that and include the city's controls?

1479
02:21:32,567 --> 02:21:32,807
Yes.

1480
02:21:37,310 --> 02:21:40,812
And I can verify those if you need to be, I actually put those in.

1481
02:21:41,813 --> 02:21:41,993
Great.

1482
02:21:42,013 --> 02:21:43,834
And I'm all set, Andre.

1483
02:21:43,854 --> 02:21:44,214
Thank you.

1484
02:21:44,654 --> 02:21:44,874
All right.

1485
02:21:44,894 --> 02:21:45,555
Thank you, class.

1486
02:21:45,575 --> 02:21:46,075
Appreciate it.

1487
02:21:47,015 --> 02:21:51,482
Any other board members have questions or comments on the discussion so far?

1488
02:21:51,502 --> 02:21:59,235
Okay, seeing none among the board members, Chris Donovan has his hand raised.

1489
02:21:59,615 --> 02:22:01,238
Annie, could you unmute him?

1490
02:22:04,339 --> 02:22:15,465
Hi, just a new comment, I guess, about the lighting and not to open up a new Pandora's box, and Ed is talking about working with us, but making sure that lighting is the right, not only spec for the city, but wattage or something.

1491
02:22:15,505 --> 02:22:26,110
I don't even know what that light would look like coming from up on a hill, but as long as we could work together on that, we'd love to make sure it works for the community up on the hill and down on the rain as well.

1492
02:22:29,592 --> 02:22:30,192
Thank you, Mr. Donovan.

1493
02:22:36,087 --> 02:22:37,047
Already here.

1494
02:22:39,408 --> 02:22:45,489
Annie, is there, I guess we could go over our conditions, just review what we have here.

1495
02:22:45,509 --> 02:23:04,333
I have a note that we need to take a vote on a waiver for the curb line, which is less than, it's more narrow than

1496
02:23:06,037 --> 02:23:07,518
than what is generally required.

1497
02:23:07,738 --> 02:23:28,625
So we need to take a vote on the board finding that it is in the public interest and not inconsistent with the intent and purpose of the subdivision control law to waive strict compliance with section 7.31 of its rules and regulations to permit 20-foot radii curb lines at the intersection with Winthrop Street on the basis that the required 30-foot

1498
02:23:30,114 --> 02:23:33,057
radii would negatively impact the safety of the intersection.

1499
02:23:33,137 --> 02:23:45,948
So this is basically just taking a vote to waive the overly wide regulation and make it more pedestrian friendly.

1500
02:23:51,092 --> 02:23:55,916
So does that need to be, Annie, does that need to be a separate vote or can that just be

1501
02:23:58,597 --> 02:24:00,638
I believe it should be a separate vote on the waiver.

1502
02:24:01,118 --> 02:24:02,579
Okay, so let's tackle that right now.

1503
02:24:02,659 --> 02:24:08,662
Is there a motion to waive the 30-foot turning radii on Wincliffe Street?

1504
02:24:12,004 --> 02:24:19,928
Can I just ask, because I'm not, I apologize, it's my first time at one of your meetings, so I'm not as familiar with how you normally do the process.

1505
02:24:20,569 --> 02:24:26,892
Before you, do you normally do all your votes at the end when you've finished any issues with public comment or?

1506
02:24:28,050 --> 02:24:29,350
That's generally what we do, yes.

1507
02:24:30,231 --> 02:24:30,451
Okay.

1508
02:24:30,671 --> 02:24:32,292
So should we put it at the end?

1509
02:24:33,332 --> 02:24:41,635
Well, I mean, I think that if you probably wanted to vote everything at the end when you're sure everyone's had their chance to comment and ask their questions.

1510
02:24:42,635 --> 02:24:45,556
Okay, and is there an order in which those votes should be?

1511
02:24:45,576 --> 02:24:55,740
No, I mean, in this case, I think you would have- Because we have the subdivision vote, we have the site plan review vote, and we have the waiver vote.

1512
02:24:56,521 --> 02:25:03,142
So I think it would make sense, subject to however you want to do it, to do the waiver vote first, then the subdivision on the site plan.

1513
02:25:04,643 --> 02:25:05,903
But I don't know that it really matters.

1514
02:25:06,723 --> 02:25:15,445
But I would recommend waiting to vote until you've finished any public comment or discussion with the applicant on matters.

1515
02:25:16,145 --> 02:25:16,365
Yes.

1516
02:25:17,085 --> 02:25:17,406
Thank you.

1517
02:25:17,446 --> 02:25:18,086
Good suggestion.

1518
02:25:18,526 --> 02:25:19,806
Robin, can I ask you a question?

1519
02:25:19,826 --> 02:25:22,347
This issue seems like a particularly

1520
02:25:27,183 --> 02:25:31,906
like an issue that has maybe more far-reaching legal implications.

1521
02:25:33,747 --> 02:25:42,733
It seems like an odd thing for us to be deciding or sort of making a decision, if you will, deciding on.

1522
02:25:43,754 --> 02:25:46,035
When you say this issue, do you mean the radii question?

1523
02:25:46,436 --> 02:25:46,656
Yeah.

1524
02:25:49,590 --> 02:26:00,435
So the subdivision control law allows you to waive components of your subdivision regulation so long as you find that they're in the public interest and not inconsistent with the subdivision control law.

1525
02:26:00,475 --> 02:26:05,537
And where it's an engineering question, I would defer to Tim's guidance on that.

1526
02:26:05,577 --> 02:26:07,358
But you're certainly legally permitted to do that.

1527
02:26:07,598 --> 02:26:10,820
It's not uncommon in subdivisions to see that.

1528
02:26:13,101 --> 02:26:14,661
Do you have a concern of some kind, Klaus?

1529
02:26:14,701 --> 02:26:16,902
Because this is what we wanted the proponent to do.

1530
02:26:18,699 --> 02:26:39,550
We're like, it seems like this is the kind of thing we should be making a recommendation on and not like deciding on because like, I mean, I'm just worst case scenario, what if someone gets in an accident because of this or that, or maybe not even because of that, but because, but uses that as a, as a, as a reason for some sort of recourse.

1531
02:26:41,568 --> 02:26:48,970
So I can answer from a subdivision perspective, you know, you have to grant the waiver or they have to comply.

1532
02:26:49,150 --> 02:26:50,851
So I mean, that is the subdivision process.

1533
02:26:52,011 --> 02:26:57,113
So if the plan is going to deviate from the requirement in the regulation, you grant the waiver.

1534
02:26:57,133 --> 02:26:58,273
I mean, that is how the process works.

1535
02:26:58,313 --> 02:27:00,194
It's not something that you make a recommendation on.

1536
02:27:03,815 --> 02:27:03,995
Right.

1537
02:27:04,475 --> 02:27:05,815
It is the appropriate way to do it.

1538
02:27:08,456 --> 02:27:11,197
I see Alicia Hunt with her hand raised.

1539
02:27:18,490 --> 02:27:19,851
Yeah, Annie, can you unmute her?

1540
02:27:21,353 --> 02:27:23,995
Sorry, my Wi-Fi keeps bouncing out.

1541
02:27:24,115 --> 02:27:27,398
And when I get fully disconnected, I lose my ability to unmute myself.

1542
02:27:28,479 --> 02:27:40,090
I just wanted to clarify that we actually are the deciding agency in the city that would say they can or cannot make it that opening.

1543
02:27:40,935 --> 02:27:42,616
more narrow the way we want to.

1544
02:27:42,976 --> 02:27:51,920
We take the advice of the engineer and the traffic engineer, but this board, the planning board, is actually the board that would decide this for a subdivision.

1545
02:27:53,061 --> 02:27:55,962
There is no other entity in the city to make that call.

1546
02:27:57,443 --> 02:28:07,967
And this is something that we've already talked about the design of the project, so I don't want to spend a lot of time on this right now, but appreciate the question.

1547
02:28:10,391 --> 02:28:14,992
Other questions and concerns from board members before we try to review the list of conditions?

1548
02:28:18,013 --> 02:28:19,593
OK, seeing none.

1549
02:28:20,533 --> 02:28:23,714
Annie, have you been taking notes on the conditions?

1550
02:28:24,014 --> 02:28:26,955
Would you be the person to run through that, or do you want me to try to do it?

1551
02:28:30,135 --> 02:28:31,316
Sure, I can do it.

1552
02:28:31,356 --> 02:28:35,997
I don't have the exact language that Robin has drafted so eloquently.

1553
02:28:37,707 --> 02:28:40,809
I may defer to her on those items.

1554
02:28:41,209 --> 02:28:43,550
Maybe just the right, the checklist of things.

1555
02:28:47,272 --> 02:28:57,257
I can chime in if you need me to, and then I've taken some notes as well, so we can always double check.

1556
02:28:57,337 --> 02:29:03,460
I can go through a few items that are sort of more administrative.

1557
02:29:04,593 --> 02:29:09,275
as conditions that I wanted to run by board members, if this is an appropriate time for that.

1558
02:29:09,675 --> 02:29:10,515
I think it is, yes.

1559
02:29:15,077 --> 02:29:16,698
So let's see.

1560
02:29:17,198 --> 02:29:22,400
Prior to endorsement, any changes must be shown on a revised subdivision plan, including a summary of conditions.

1561
02:29:25,221 --> 02:29:34,386
The subdivision shall comply with all applicable standards and regulations as set forth in the Community Development Board Rules and Regulations, except for those for which a waiver has been approved.

1562
02:29:39,308 --> 02:29:48,093
Consistent with Mass General Law, Chapter 41, Section 81U, after the expiration of 20 days without notice of appeal to Superior Court or Land Court,

1563
02:29:48,624 --> 02:29:50,025
The board shall endorse the plan.

1564
02:29:50,225 --> 02:30:02,673
This endorsement shall occur following the provision of a performance guarantee in accordance with Mass General Law, Chapter 41, Section 81U, in an amount determined by the city engineer and approved by the board.

1565
02:30:03,214 --> 02:30:09,578
Said amount shall bear a direct reasonable relationship to the expected cost of the work, including inflation necessary to complete the work.

1566
02:30:10,138 --> 02:30:15,322
The amount shall be revised from time to time on recommendation of the city engineer to reflect the remaining cost of the work.

1567
02:30:17,022 --> 02:30:22,983
construction of the subdivision improvements shall be completed within two years of the date of endorsement of the plans by the board.

1568
02:30:24,224 --> 02:30:29,065
And this project is subject to linkage fees, city of Medford zoning ordinance chapter 94 sections 94382.

1569
02:30:29,265 --> 02:30:30,385
And in terms of conditions recommended by

1570
02:30:39,698 --> 02:30:47,159
City staff compliance with conditions recommended by Timothy McGivern, city engineer, in a letter to the board dated August 18th, 2020.

1571
02:30:50,480 --> 02:30:55,341
And we've discussed the fire chief's comments.

1572
02:30:55,741 --> 02:31:06,403
So I think adding the the condition, the reworded condition about the

1573
02:31:10,809 --> 02:31:20,793
The island in the middle, I need to look back at his comments specifically to see if, let me look at them now, if there are any others to include.

1574
02:31:20,813 --> 02:31:20,873
His,

1575
02:31:34,150 --> 02:31:44,617
Other one was about the 12 foot right of way for access to 553, 555 Winthrop Street shall be repaved all weather roadway and shall be as wide as boundaries allow.

1576
02:31:46,478 --> 02:31:49,460
So if that is a condition that the board would like to attach.

1577
02:31:51,022 --> 02:31:54,524
And then the recommendation about sprinklers is this other one.

1578
02:31:54,544 --> 02:32:01,048
But I don't think we can, Attorney Stein, I don't think we can include that language on the right of way, right?

1579
02:32:01,088 --> 02:32:03,450
Because of the outstanding issue.

1580
02:32:04,360 --> 02:32:06,082
that we discussed, is that correct?

1581
02:32:06,162 --> 02:32:08,604
Well, it's one of the notes that I had.

1582
02:32:12,207 --> 02:32:15,090
Is it contemplated, and this has to do with paving the right-of-way, correct?

1583
02:32:17,172 --> 02:32:20,856
So is it contemplated that if the right-of-way is relocated, it will be paved?

1584
02:32:22,197 --> 02:32:22,457
Yes.

1585
02:32:23,838 --> 02:32:25,540
And is the applicant in agreement to that?

1586
02:32:27,755 --> 02:32:35,858
So why don't we work with that condition just to add in that they're going to accomplish the relocation if they can, and that will include paving.

1587
02:32:36,458 --> 02:32:36,699
Great.

1588
02:32:38,199 --> 02:32:39,039
So I'll work on that.

1589
02:32:39,099 --> 02:32:46,202
And again, I know I've said this, but obviously the final vote tonight for the written decision will be subject to final approval by the chair.

1590
02:32:46,262 --> 02:32:51,164
And so there may be some tweaking of the exact wording of things before it's filed, just to be clear.

1591
02:32:51,944 --> 02:32:52,145
Yeah.

1592
02:32:54,125 --> 02:32:54,265
OK.

1593
02:32:56,243 --> 02:33:03,590
There was a comment letter, a few of them, but the most recent one we have from Marianne O'Connor, the director of public health.

1594
02:33:03,650 --> 02:33:08,554
She did not submit a new one, but she has expressed that her conditions still apply.

1595
02:33:08,694 --> 02:33:12,237
One of them is to submit a written plan for proper dust remediation.

1596
02:33:13,018 --> 02:33:22,186
One of them is a detailed solid waste plan must be submitted to the board of health and that dumpster permits must be obtained for any dumpsters prior to construction beginning.

1597
02:33:23,343 --> 02:33:26,584
and another that integrated pest management is required.

1598
02:33:28,864 --> 02:33:31,884
And she goes into more detail on each of those in her letter.

1599
02:33:34,985 --> 02:33:49,888
And then the other city comment letter that was not updated with the remand, but contains items that the author stated still apply is from Brian Cairns, Commissioner of Public Works.

1600
02:33:50,548 --> 02:33:51,488
And the first two are,

1601
02:33:53,146 --> 02:34:08,498
My understanding and Tim's comment number 47 on this is that the proponent will be working with the engineering department and the DPW to address concerns about the water main.

1602
02:34:09,839 --> 02:34:17,765
So that takes care of his first two comments that were about his uncertainty about the water main.

1603
02:34:21,712 --> 02:34:27,794
Hydrant locations will be determined by the fire department, noting that one hydrant must be on Winthrop Street.

1604
02:34:27,974 --> 02:34:34,137
The minimum water main size is eight inch ductile piping and one inch copper services into the 10 residential lots.

1605
02:34:34,177 --> 02:34:38,278
We'll also maintain a loop system around the property adhering to the 10 foot water and sewer separation.

1606
02:34:38,898 --> 02:34:44,120
All standard testing for pressure and bacteria shall be in accordance with the DEP and AWWA standard.

1607
02:34:44,340 --> 02:34:48,782
Water mains that intersect with other water main piping to the triple gated and open to the right

1608
02:34:50,037 --> 02:34:53,419
All water services will be placed in the sidewalk with shutoffs off the property line.

1609
02:34:53,479 --> 02:34:58,722
All service connection on the old six inch water main will be replaced with one inch copper to the property line with new shutoffs.

1610
02:34:59,322 --> 02:35:03,385
All as built will be reviewed by water and sewer and the engineering divisions.

1611
02:35:03,725 --> 02:35:06,807
Any work performed on water and sewer must be inspected before backfilling.

1612
02:35:06,867 --> 02:35:11,369
Emergency phone numbers must be provided prior to any work being done on roads in Medford.

1613
02:35:11,429 --> 02:35:13,630
Drawings and pre-construction meetings are advised.

1614
02:35:13,750 --> 02:35:18,433
Any contractor working on water services must be a certified drain layer licensed with the city of Medford.

1615
02:35:19,698 --> 02:35:27,825
and these are all items that were responded to by Mr. Champion, I believe had all been resolved, correct?

1616
02:35:28,606 --> 02:35:32,349
Except for the water main that you were working with the city to accommodate.

1617
02:35:33,610 --> 02:35:36,373
We actually did the inspection on the water main.

1618
02:35:38,775 --> 02:35:41,617
We cut a section out and they have it.

1619
02:35:45,280 --> 02:35:46,661
So I believe and

1620
02:35:48,041 --> 02:35:55,367
That's an extensive list and just from hearing the things, but I believe that the current plans adhere to the rules and rights.

1621
02:35:56,308 --> 02:36:03,073
So if something he's suggesting is different from the plan, I'd like to focus on the plans.

1622
02:36:04,234 --> 02:36:04,814
I don't know.

1623
02:36:04,834 --> 02:36:09,398
There was something in there in the midst of that conversation about a water loop.

1624
02:36:11,433 --> 02:36:14,315
which I think the plans are correct.

1625
02:36:14,896 --> 02:36:20,180
Address to the satisfaction of the commissioner of public works, his comments.

1626
02:36:21,841 --> 02:36:22,602
One more time, I'm sorry.

1627
02:36:22,982 --> 02:36:27,646
Would it be appropriate to address to the satisfaction of the commissioner of public works to work with him?

1628
02:36:27,666 --> 02:36:32,470
So I think it's to the satisfaction of the rules and regulations.

1629
02:36:38,127 --> 02:36:40,008
So I believe a lot of these were addressed.

1630
02:36:40,088 --> 02:36:42,890
It says triple gates are shown in the plan in your response.

1631
02:36:45,032 --> 02:36:50,736
You commit to the utility contractor being on the city's approved list.

1632
02:36:51,376 --> 02:36:54,078
Of course, yeah.

1633
02:36:54,979 --> 02:36:59,362
Pressure and bacteria tests will be in accordance with the EPA and AWWA standards.

1634
02:37:00,923 --> 02:37:03,505
You say the hydrants have been coordinated with the fire department.

1635
02:37:05,723 --> 02:37:09,584
and that the plans have been modified to have 10 feet of separation, except at the crossings.

1636
02:37:10,065 --> 02:37:14,286
So it appears that all of these were addressed.

1637
02:37:15,087 --> 02:37:30,993
So I agree, I just, the concern from our side is that when we add on the language that states that it'll be to a certain individuals, you know, there's rules and regulations and we'd follow those.

1638
02:37:31,993 --> 02:37:34,554
So I forgot the exact way the comment was,

1639
02:37:35,680 --> 02:37:44,044
with regard to the satisfaction of, I think it's the satisfaction of the rules and regulations.

1640
02:37:44,925 --> 02:37:50,027
So adhering to the rules and regulations and adhering to this, the rule, the guides.

1641
02:37:50,487 --> 02:38:01,093
Yeah, I think what Annie had said was the subdivision shall comply with all applicable standards and regulations as set forth in the, well, that's the community development board rules and regulations.

1642
02:38:05,073 --> 02:38:09,595
Sorry, I don't know if that was, I think the other section was- I believe we've added that whole list.

1643
02:38:10,136 --> 02:38:10,356
Yeah.

1644
02:38:12,717 --> 02:38:15,178
So you've reviewed and responded to each item in here.

1645
02:38:15,378 --> 02:38:23,022
I just wanted to kind of have it on record in case some of these might still be outstanding.

1646
02:38:23,122 --> 02:38:31,146
So it appears that you have addressed all of them from your responses too, but we don't have an updated letter from the commissioner.

1647
02:38:32,160 --> 02:38:32,320
Right.

1648
02:38:32,340 --> 02:38:43,686
So the condition, uh, and we'll have basically compliance to the satisfaction of each department head, um, with any unrecommendations made in letters to the board and then citing the specific letters.

1649
02:38:43,726 --> 02:38:45,407
So it's not going to be add ons at all.

1650
02:38:45,447 --> 02:38:50,410
It was going to be referencing the specific letters and the items that you've already seen.

1651
02:38:53,471 --> 02:38:59,194
And we'll take out the fire chiefs, I think, and dealing with that separately because, um, we've, we've adjusted that.

1652
02:39:00,055 --> 02:39:00,375
Fair enough.

1653
02:39:03,299 --> 02:39:07,300
And I think lighting as well, you've addressed separately.

1654
02:39:07,340 --> 02:39:16,563
I think another condition that was discussed was about notification to the- The blast plan?

1655
02:39:17,044 --> 02:39:23,566
Yeah, a blasting to the director of community development or her designee.

1656
02:39:28,828 --> 02:39:28,968
And

1657
02:39:30,700 --> 02:39:36,904
Tim, did you want us to add the vegetated area to the homeowners association for your comment?

1658
02:39:38,024 --> 02:39:43,047
Yes.

1659
02:39:43,387 --> 02:39:48,270
It's adjacent to the extension of the right of way as an explanation of where it is.

1660
02:39:51,514 --> 02:39:58,859
And the only other thing is the housekeeping item, Annie, is my recommended condition number two, associated with the grantees.

1661
02:39:58,899 --> 02:40:03,502
I think that can just be fully rescinded and replaced with the language that we've discussed.

1662
02:40:08,186 --> 02:40:09,326
And Robin has that language.

1663
02:40:10,447 --> 02:40:11,027
Yeah.

1664
02:40:11,068 --> 02:40:11,268
I do.

1665
02:40:11,868 --> 02:40:13,029
Rescind number two out of my letter.

1666
02:40:19,263 --> 02:40:29,289
And then, Tim, I guess the final thing we didn't cover that we had brought up in prior meetings was just around the pedestrian safety for the crossing.

1667
02:40:29,469 --> 02:40:39,995
I think we discussed you were going to look into the feasibility of doing like a blinking light or some signage.

1668
02:40:40,015 --> 02:40:42,376
I don't know if you had a recommendation on that.

1669
02:40:46,078 --> 02:40:46,839
We did look into it.

1670
02:40:48,165 --> 02:40:49,566
Something like that could go there.

1671
02:40:52,107 --> 02:40:55,569
It's hard for me to commit to something because so much is going on in that whole corridor.

1672
02:40:57,330 --> 02:40:59,952
But I mean, this project does have linkage fees.

1673
02:41:00,132 --> 02:41:11,079
I mean, we could think about doing something with those if the board wanted to condition some sort of actuated signal light.

1674
02:41:11,099 --> 02:41:13,800
Todd, are you still on the call or no?

1675
02:41:14,481 --> 02:41:14,681
No.

1676
02:41:15,401 --> 02:41:16,762
I don't know if that

1677
02:41:17,305 --> 02:41:23,688
location is entirely appropriate for some sort of actuated blinking light for the pedestrian crossing or not?

1678
02:41:24,328 --> 02:41:25,588
The question was brought up last time.

1679
02:41:26,609 --> 02:41:33,332
Yeah, looking at that quarter from the high school, the place that road, it's about an 18 foot 100 stretch without the crosswalk.

1680
02:41:33,352 --> 02:41:36,813
So this one's going to be placed roughly halfway about 900 feet.

1681
02:41:37,473 --> 02:41:38,454
So that's a good thing.

1682
02:41:38,894 --> 02:41:41,335
In terms of enhancements, I was actually thinking of that.

1683
02:41:43,276 --> 02:41:46,617
You could go to the flasher that's just constantly flashing.

1684
02:41:47,375 --> 02:41:51,736
Those are just order of magnitude costs for people, informational purposes only.

1685
02:41:51,756 --> 02:41:59,698
A set of those would be in the $3,500 range on U-channels, solar powered.

1686
02:42:00,238 --> 02:42:09,980
And then something like a RFB on more substantial pole, like folks know at Governor's Avenue and High Street, that's more about $20,000 per setup.

1687
02:42:11,021 --> 02:42:16,142
And there's kind of a hybrid of between where it's an RFB on a U-channel style that DCR uses a lot.

1688
02:42:18,006 --> 02:42:19,286
like 13 grand is set up.

1689
02:42:20,287 --> 02:42:30,508
So in terms of if it would be helpful, I think the enhancements are always helpful, especially coming southbound, you know, there's a little bit of a curve before you reach this area.

1690
02:42:30,548 --> 02:42:33,749
So any enhancement to visibility is always a good thing.

1691
02:42:36,190 --> 02:42:37,950
So, you know, those are good suggestions.

1692
02:42:38,690 --> 02:42:42,951
Going back to Tim's point about not knowing what's happening with the whole corridor,

1693
02:42:44,112 --> 02:42:56,997
The curb that's listed as radius 20 on Lorain Road side, with that being the parking shoulder side, you could even potentially bump that out even more into Winthrop Street to add visibility and sight lines for the pedestrians.

1694
02:42:58,118 --> 02:43:04,140
But without doing any physical things like that, enhanced signs wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing.

1695
02:43:08,502 --> 02:43:16,723
And what, well, an enhanced signage, what would that look like when sort of a pedestrian right of way in the middle of the roadway or what?

1696
02:43:17,884 --> 02:43:34,347
So, yeah, beyond what's shown on the plan, you could add, instead of the static fluorescent yellow green diamond sign, you could have one of those with LED border that flashes all the time throughout City Metro, we have about 20 of them or so in the solar powered.

1697
02:43:34,747 --> 02:43:36,807
So that's no actuation, no ped button,

1698
02:43:37,349 --> 02:43:45,713
But then the next level up is something that you see on DCI roadways where it's a ped button actuated flashing light, but it's RFB.

1699
02:43:45,753 --> 02:43:49,495
Those got the white rectangular flashing lights.

1700
02:43:50,196 --> 02:43:55,739
And then there's a more sturdy permanent style like the ones we have on Salem and River and Governors Hub and High.

1701
02:43:56,019 --> 02:43:58,620
Those are push button activated as well.

1702
02:44:00,081 --> 02:44:05,124
It wouldn't involve any median in the middle, Chairman, because the cross section of this area

1703
02:44:06,043 --> 02:44:24,998
is out there today, and it's likely to remain in the future, just to be refined a bit so it's more definitive, is a bike lane on the development side, a traveling, traveling bike lane, and a parking shoulder on the Lorain Road side that would match up with west or north of the project.

1704
02:44:25,619 --> 02:44:27,680
So that's likely the cross section here.

1705
02:44:27,760 --> 02:44:29,942
So there's not much room to add anything like that.

1706
02:44:30,382 --> 02:44:33,685
It would potentially could add a bump out shielding the parking shoulder

1707
02:44:34,463 --> 02:44:37,407
on the Lorain Road side that would shorten the crossing distance?

1708
02:44:40,571 --> 02:44:44,496
All right, I see one of the neighbors, Chris Donovan, would like to speak.

1709
02:44:44,556 --> 02:44:45,357
Could he be unmuted?

1710
02:44:50,913 --> 02:44:58,179
I think that crosswalk, that bump, all the things that Todd's talking about right now is really one of the game changers in this development.

1711
02:44:58,539 --> 02:45:07,426
And I think Todd's, we talked about some of them last night's on for some of these changes that may not be in Ed's purview, but they are tied in with this crosswalk.

1712
02:45:07,526 --> 02:45:09,447
So we're excited for that crosswalk.

1713
02:45:09,467 --> 02:45:12,209
We may not want it overdeveloped and too lit up.

1714
02:45:12,270 --> 02:45:19,135
It's a pretty quiet area, but that crosswalk and a light or something, they have to slow down people coming around that curve.

1715
02:45:19,575 --> 02:45:22,597
is really a game changer in this neighborhood.

1716
02:45:22,657 --> 02:45:27,060
So some of the traffic calming that Todd is talking about, we're really excited for that.

1717
02:45:27,100 --> 02:45:36,486
And it really changes the dynamic of this neighborhood, which includes sliding over the center line, bike lanes, and a parking lane, and hopefully some sidewalks coming up.

1718
02:45:36,546 --> 02:45:41,749
So this is really, the crosswalk is really the crux of how this connection started with Ed.

1719
02:45:41,769 --> 02:45:44,931
And so we'd really love to see a good, nice crosswalk, well lit,

1720
02:45:45,351 --> 02:45:50,943
I have a little there's a telephone pole that's going up to Lorraine if we just twisted it the other way 90 degrees would be right about the crosswalk.

1721
02:45:51,364 --> 02:45:53,789
Put some lighting on it in that very dark corner.

1722
02:45:54,232 --> 02:46:06,154
I think it's a win-win without really overthinking it and putting in too much flashing light, because we would love to sort of have a nice quiet community at nighttime as well versus the flashing.

1723
02:46:06,194 --> 02:46:06,934
So thank you.

1724
02:46:06,954 --> 02:46:08,355
And the crosswalk is really important.

1725
02:46:08,375 --> 02:46:09,775
We just don't want to overthink it.

1726
02:46:09,815 --> 02:46:14,156
But a bump out or a raise, people come pretty quickly around that corner.

1727
02:46:14,196 --> 02:46:15,716
And that's definitely a game changer.

1728
02:46:15,776 --> 02:46:18,577
So thank you for including this as part of this development project.

1729
02:46:21,412 --> 02:46:25,794
I think the question is, I don't think a bump out is part of it right now, is that correct?

1730
02:46:26,494 --> 02:46:30,596
It's not, but some of those changes are in the way via Todd, and Todd has a plan for that.

1731
02:46:30,896 --> 02:46:43,161
And we're excited here in the neighborhood that the crosswalk that's coming from 551, that's, I guess, part of the plan, is what started this fire of getting the sidewalks and some traffic safety in the area.

1732
02:46:43,201 --> 02:46:46,362
So that's where I thought the direction was going, and Todd's got a pretty good handle on it.

1733
02:46:46,382 --> 02:46:47,602
We're pretty excited for what's coming.

1734
02:46:49,545 --> 02:46:53,688
Yeah, just to clarify, I know we talked about a vision and plan.

1735
02:46:54,108 --> 02:47:01,234
Mr Donovan, but yeah, there wasn't necessarily a plan for the city to do a bump on at this particular crosswalk.

1736
02:47:01,414 --> 02:47:03,615
Yeah, but it could be an opportunity here.

1737
02:47:03,635 --> 02:47:08,619
Well, is there is the city's engineering department making a recommendation.

1738
02:47:12,492 --> 02:47:14,214
Well, I don't think we're making a recommendation.

1739
02:47:14,234 --> 02:47:20,462
I think that there are some reasonable signage improvements that could be made over what the plan is.

1740
02:47:21,844 --> 02:47:27,811
The recommendations from the engineering division came through the form of comments and where we've

1741
02:47:28,847 --> 02:47:29,748
been up to at this point.

1742
02:47:29,788 --> 02:47:42,201
I think what we're saying is if the board wanted to explore discussing with the proponent, some additional measures like signage, things like that, then, you know, we were saying that there would be nothing to preclude that.

1743
02:47:43,885 --> 02:47:57,090
So neighbors saying that a flashing light might be too much or an actuator beacon might be too much, but then we're saying that nothing would preclude signage or something else to draw attention to the crosswalk.

1744
02:47:57,350 --> 02:48:01,851
And it's within the board's purview to have that discussion with the proponent, so it's for a condition, so.

1745
02:48:01,971 --> 02:48:11,715
Yeah, so we're supportive and listening to the neighborhood that adds a lot of value knowing that they may prefer a curb extension bump out versus flashing lights.

1746
02:48:12,750 --> 02:48:16,372
That seems like a suitable and reasonable thing to do.

1747
02:48:17,412 --> 02:48:24,896
The proponent would have to look at the drainage if it required an extra catch patient or moving a catch patient if the curve extension was added.

1748
02:48:25,616 --> 02:48:27,677
But we're supportive of that idea.

1749
02:48:27,697 --> 02:48:31,059
We're happy for any incremental changes.

1750
02:48:31,099 --> 02:48:31,579
So thank you.

1751
02:48:31,599 --> 02:48:32,920
It's nothing but a win-win.

1752
02:48:32,980 --> 02:48:37,462
So thank you for keeping the crosswalk in your sights.

1753
02:48:38,723 --> 02:48:40,724
Mr. Champy, based on what you heard, is there

1754
02:48:41,517 --> 02:48:44,638
anything that you think you can, you'd be able to accomplish here?

1755
02:48:44,658 --> 02:48:56,642
Well, I mean, yeah, we're happy to, I mean, we've, so, so all of the changes, I mean, I, I just think, you know, we crossed that street too, cause we've been there for probably longer than some of the residents, you know?

1756
02:48:58,243 --> 02:49:02,664
So, you know, we'll work with the neighborhoods and engineering.

1757
02:49:02,744 --> 02:49:09,106
And I think I even wrote in one of my emails, you know, we're, we're happy to participate as long as someone takes the lead.

1758
02:49:11,358 --> 02:49:13,699
So we'll coordinate, we'll participate.

1759
02:49:13,719 --> 02:49:19,121
If it's bumping off the curb instead of putting the curb in, we don't have a problem with doing what's best.

1760
02:49:19,381 --> 02:49:24,904
The crosswalk and the sidewalk is all done for the betterment of the community.

1761
02:49:24,944 --> 02:49:28,245
So if it needs to be tweaked, I'm open to it.

1762
02:49:31,227 --> 02:49:32,187
So we're very willing.

1763
02:49:32,878 --> 02:49:34,458
We don't, it doesn't need to go in as drawn.

1764
02:49:34,518 --> 02:49:38,840
We just drew what we thought was appropriate at the time.

1765
02:49:39,160 --> 02:49:41,380
So I think that there's been more involvement over the past year.

1766
02:49:42,361 --> 02:49:53,644
So if we approve it as is and someone wants to bump it or move it or adjust it, we'd be happy to, until it's built, once it's built, then we'd like it to leave it as it is.

1767
02:49:53,724 --> 02:49:59,085
So I guess the verbiage I would use would be that we'll cooperate with

1768
02:50:00,387 --> 02:50:01,508
the changes that are required.

1769
02:50:01,548 --> 02:50:03,050
I mean, within reason, right?

1770
02:50:03,070 --> 02:50:09,455
They can't, you know, we don't want to put a pedestrian crosswalk that's overhead or something like that, but we're happy to participate.

1771
02:50:11,777 --> 02:50:16,000
Attorney Stein, do you have a recommendation on how to word something like this?

1772
02:50:17,501 --> 02:50:22,205
Just so that I'm clear, what is currently shown on the plans on this issue?

1773
02:50:23,146 --> 02:50:25,368
Is there a, there's a crosswalk shown on the plan?

1774
02:50:25,768 --> 02:50:26,189
Yeah, there is.

1775
02:50:27,140 --> 02:50:27,360
Yes.

1776
02:50:27,560 --> 02:50:29,442
And that's a sidewalk.

1777
02:50:29,922 --> 02:50:34,005
In my comments, we're happy that there is a crosswalk, not necessarily anything additional.

1778
02:50:34,245 --> 02:50:38,909
What's already been planned is fine, and it's an incremental change that we appreciate.

1779
02:50:38,929 --> 02:50:40,530
Okay, great.

1780
02:50:41,431 --> 02:50:44,893
So do you want to leave it as is, or do you want something additional?

1781
02:50:45,354 --> 02:50:47,315
Well, so I guess my... Go ahead, Deanna.

1782
02:50:47,816 --> 02:50:51,498
Is there any signs related to the crosswalk currently on the plans?

1783
02:50:51,638 --> 02:50:52,339
I can't remember.

1784
02:50:52,980 --> 02:50:55,161
I believe the standard static W11-2

1785
02:50:56,679 --> 02:51:08,082
Yeah, I was going to say that at the very least, that those signs that come basically at most crosswalks, which is the warning signs, should be on both directions.

1786
02:51:08,802 --> 02:51:13,864
To answer the attorney's question, the crosswalk is proposed, which includes a ramp on either side.

1787
02:51:14,424 --> 02:51:21,826
It does include tightening the radius on the Lorain Road side, but that does not include a curb extension out into Winter Street.

1788
02:51:22,486 --> 02:51:25,007
So that's the, it would be a modification to the,

1789
02:51:25,437 --> 02:51:27,199
to the curb that's shown on the plan.

1790
02:51:28,681 --> 02:51:29,943
If you change the sidewalk?

1791
02:51:30,724 --> 02:51:41,578
If you add a curb extension, it would make it a shorter crossing and it would adjust that radius that's called out as 20 on the northwest corner.

1792
02:51:41,598 --> 02:51:42,679
Okay.

1793
02:51:44,454 --> 02:51:47,695
So I guess, oh, go ahead, no.

1794
02:51:48,035 --> 02:51:50,095
I'm sorry, Mr. Chair and Ms.

1795
02:51:50,115 --> 02:51:50,375
Stein.

1796
02:51:50,755 --> 02:52:04,457
How about we, if we approve as is or with the curb extension, you know, based on whatever engineering decides they, the engineering or the neighborhood decides they want, we'll do either or.

1797
02:52:05,498 --> 02:52:08,198
As it is or we'll extend the curb and we'll do either or.

1798
02:52:10,539 --> 02:52:13,199
The curb extension would be on which side?

1799
02:52:13,781 --> 02:52:15,002
both sides, one side?

1800
02:52:18,984 --> 02:52:27,149
I was imagining the Winthrop Street side, you know, Lorraine would be nice too, but it is a tight angle for turning vehicles.

1801
02:52:28,169 --> 02:52:34,373
Basically, the curb extension would be on Winthrop, shielding the parking shoulder, so it would be in line with the parking shoulder on that side of the street.

1802
02:52:34,693 --> 02:52:43,358
You could say, add a condition to modify the curb radii that's shown on the Lorraine Road corner, the northwest corner, to include

1803
02:52:43,797 --> 02:52:53,224
or a curb extension into Winter Street, and DCI will, you know, modify design and would review it, you know.

1804
02:52:53,244 --> 02:53:10,917
So how about if we say something along the lines of at the request of the city's, and you can correct me if I have the wrong departments here, at the request of the city's Inspectional Services Department, the applicant shall install a curb extension on the

1805
02:53:13,557 --> 02:53:14,658
Winthrop Street side?

1806
02:53:14,678 --> 02:53:18,680
Is that correct?

1807
02:53:18,700 --> 02:53:25,804
Yeah, I say west side, but some people are saying south side, so it's kind of like the southwest.

1808
02:53:26,044 --> 02:53:28,886
To me, it's the northwest corner of Winthrop Street and Lorain Road.

1809
02:53:28,906 --> 02:53:33,849
Right, we're talking about the side adjacent to Mary Kenny Way, the new Mary Kenny Way, right?

1810
02:53:34,990 --> 02:53:35,190
No.

1811
02:53:35,710 --> 02:53:36,510
No, the other side?

1812
02:53:36,530 --> 02:53:39,472
On the same street, not the Lorain Road side.

1813
02:53:40,353 --> 02:53:40,593
All right.

1814
02:53:40,613 --> 02:53:40,793
Sorry.

1815
02:53:43,438 --> 02:53:46,279
The plans have a proposed signage and striping plan.

1816
02:53:46,679 --> 02:53:55,802
It's sheet 6.3 that shows on Lorraine street side, the corner of Lorraine and Winthrop.

1817
02:53:56,442 --> 02:54:02,164
The way I read that is a curb bump out, but not on the side of the street with Mary Kenny way.

1818
02:54:03,944 --> 02:54:08,886
Can we treat it as a field change and we'll leave it as is and we'll propose on the Tim and

1819
02:54:10,910 --> 02:54:24,694
Well, that's why I think, how about if we just say at the request of the city's engineering department, the applicant shall revise the proposed crosswalk?

1820
02:54:25,754 --> 02:54:26,054
Hold on.

1821
02:54:26,194 --> 02:54:27,875
There's only one, right?

1822
02:54:29,186 --> 02:54:30,727
if we just pause for a second here.

1823
02:54:31,187 --> 02:54:46,171
So yeah, so I think nothing's gonna happen if it's just coordinate with engineering department, because we made recommendations about pedestrian safety and plans were made or changes, revisions were made to the plan.

1824
02:54:46,512 --> 02:54:56,755
So if the board itself would like to condition bump outs there, then what we're saying is that nothing would preclude that.

1825
02:54:57,758 --> 02:55:06,720
and also if the board would like to condition additional signage or lighting or something along those lines, there's nothing that would preclude that.

1826
02:55:07,340 --> 02:55:18,743
However, the coordination piece with the engineering department would happen on our sidewalk project when we're abutting up against their project and we'll coordinate with them.

1827
02:55:19,352 --> 02:55:33,498
and how that, but if the board would like to have bump-outs, extensions here for pedestrian safety, and the proponent is willing to do that, then the board has the power to make that happen.

1828
02:55:33,738 --> 02:55:35,579
That's what we're saying from an engineering standpoint.

1829
02:55:35,599 --> 02:55:42,321
So I wouldn't think that some sort of condition that requires coordination with us is going to be productive.

1830
02:55:43,462 --> 02:55:43,682
Okay.

1831
02:55:43,862 --> 02:55:45,523
I mean, you can make that decision right now.

1832
02:55:45,863 --> 02:55:49,064
Yeah, I mean, I would be in favor of just including the bump-out

1833
02:55:49,771 --> 02:55:51,032
Um, okay.

1834
02:55:51,212 --> 02:55:58,894
I guess my question is, though, are we talking about bump outs on both sides of Winthrop Street next to Lorraine and on the other side or just the Lorraine side?

1835
02:55:59,334 --> 02:56:08,417
I could clarify because, um, the Winthrop State Development or the Mary Kinney side, it's not that side because that side's a bike lane, doesn't have a parking shortage.

1836
02:56:08,437 --> 02:56:08,638
Got it.

1837
02:56:08,798 --> 02:56:09,038
Okay.

1838
02:56:09,698 --> 02:56:11,298
So I just wanted to be clear about that.

1839
02:56:12,919 --> 02:56:13,199
Okay.

1840
02:56:13,319 --> 02:56:14,920
How about you tell me if this works?

1841
02:56:15,320 --> 02:56:18,741
Um, the applicant shall revise the proposed crosswalk

1842
02:56:20,504 --> 02:56:27,825
And there's only one, correct, shown on the plan to add a curb extension on the Lorain Road side of the crosswalk?

1843
02:56:28,786 --> 02:56:34,027
I guess to clarify, there are two crosswalks, but there's one crossing Winthrop Street.

1844
02:56:35,007 --> 02:56:43,488
Okay, so we'll say the applicant shall revise the proposed crosswalk crossing Winthrop Street.

1845
02:56:44,488 --> 02:56:47,209
And shown on the plan, is it a curb extension?

1846
02:56:48,570 --> 02:56:51,352
Yeah, there's two names, curb extension or bump out, either or.

1847
02:56:51,372 --> 02:56:59,317
I would say to add a curb extension on the Lorain Road side of the street.

1848
02:56:59,337 --> 02:57:04,200
Is there anything about- Well, Tim, I think she's right.

1849
02:57:04,501 --> 02:57:07,643
Lorain Road side of the street versus Mary Kenny side of the street.

1850
02:57:07,663 --> 02:57:10,285
Yeah, she already said the crossing Winthrop Street.

1851
02:57:10,445 --> 02:57:11,966
That's what the- Yeah.

1852
02:57:12,206 --> 02:57:13,767
The crosswalk, okay.

1853
02:57:14,288 --> 02:57:23,835
Well, I thought I'm sorry, I thought we were talking about a bump out on the Mary Kenny drive side because we have a bike lane that is going in.

1854
02:57:23,855 --> 02:57:26,337
Todd, sorry.

1855
02:57:26,497 --> 02:57:28,178
Yeah, so I could start over.

1856
02:57:28,238 --> 02:57:42,068
So on the Mary Kenny side, there's a bike lane that should be adjacent to the curb that's out there now on the proposed curb, then there'll be two 11 foot travel lanes, bike lane, the parking shoulder, which is where the bump out and curb extensions go is on the

1857
02:57:42,515 --> 02:57:45,696
side opposite the development on the Lorain Road side.

1858
02:57:45,716 --> 02:57:47,956
Okay, you're right.

1859
02:57:48,796 --> 02:58:03,179
So is it sufficient if we just say the applicant shall revise the proposed crosswalk crossing Winthrop Street and show on the plan to add a curb extension on the Lorain Road side of the street, and then to the extent the board wants different signage, we can add a condition for that as well?

1860
02:58:03,639 --> 02:58:07,980
Well, I think the signage that's already in there seems to be the standard, so I think we're good with that.

1861
02:58:08,520 --> 02:58:09,040
Mr. Champy?

1862
02:58:09,060 --> 02:58:09,340
Excellent.

1863
02:58:09,893 --> 02:58:12,635
All right, Mr. Chair, one last point, Robin, if I may.

1864
02:58:13,596 --> 02:58:20,902
In the event that the, this is all in the event that the right-of-way extension takes place, otherwise this sidewalk, this crosswalk's gonna move across.

1865
02:58:21,603 --> 02:58:24,645
It's gonna move down the road.

1866
02:58:24,705 --> 02:58:35,734
Yeah, to be determined, that's why I was pointing that out earlier, that if that driveway exists, this crosswalk, yeah, may become a mid-block somewhere else or at Smith or something like that.

1867
02:58:36,174 --> 02:58:39,397
So this is pending the right-of-way extension being agreed upon?

1868
02:58:40,495 --> 02:58:41,876
Otherwise, we won't be doing the bump up.

1869
02:58:43,257 --> 02:58:47,240
So I'm actually just going to, like, obviously, we have to write up the whole decision and put it together.

1870
02:58:47,300 --> 02:58:51,364
I'll add those at the same part that the applicant shall accomplish the relocation if possible.

1871
02:58:51,744 --> 02:58:54,526
And then if the relocation is accomplished, you'll do this.

1872
02:58:55,107 --> 02:58:55,367
Correct.

1873
02:58:56,368 --> 02:58:56,648
OK.

1874
02:58:58,329 --> 02:59:04,154
Yeah, if I follow that correctly, just like Tim said before, if the driver wasn't accomplished, there'd be a revision anyways.

1875
02:59:04,214 --> 02:59:05,675
And at that time, we could address them.

1876
02:59:06,575 --> 02:59:06,795
Okay.

1877
02:59:07,255 --> 02:59:11,957
And if I could sort of close out, this could be one of the most transformative changes in the area.

1878
02:59:12,017 --> 02:59:19,019
So what the board is doing tonight, even though this is kind of in the weeds, it could be one of the most transformative changes on Winthrop street in a long time.

1879
02:59:19,039 --> 02:59:20,259
So thank you for dealing with that.

1880
02:59:20,299 --> 02:59:31,083
And I know Ed understands a little bit of the complexity of finishing that up, but Todd laid out a pretty good safety plan last night and sort of follow that plan, which we were just kind of talking about as a win, win, win.

1881
02:59:31,103 --> 02:59:31,903
So we thank you.

1882
02:59:31,923 --> 02:59:34,224
And it's very important for that crosswalk.

1883
02:59:34,724 --> 02:59:36,826
and whatever comes for the safety features of all it.

1884
02:59:36,866 --> 02:59:37,546
So thank you all.

1885
02:59:38,027 --> 02:59:39,107
Yeah, thank you, Mr. Donovan.

1886
02:59:39,127 --> 02:59:40,228
I thought it was worth the time.

1887
02:59:42,530 --> 02:59:47,834
All right, so we have a set of conditions I think that we agree on.

1888
02:59:47,894 --> 02:59:53,738
Do the board members have, was there anything that was missing or that they were concerned about?

1889
02:59:55,768 --> 02:59:57,629
Seeing none, Attorney Stein, I see your hand.

1890
02:59:57,689 --> 03:00:03,912
I just, I had a couple notes that I just wanted to make sure had been covered in what we've already discussed.

1891
03:00:03,932 --> 03:00:07,213
So one is just adding the condition of the naming of Mary Cannyway.

1892
03:00:07,853 --> 03:00:08,033
Yes.

1893
03:00:09,094 --> 03:00:11,135
I'm assuming that's going to be an actual condition to the project.

1894
03:00:11,495 --> 03:00:11,675
Yes.

1895
03:00:12,640 --> 03:00:19,686
Um, I think a general condition that the project and site improvement shall be in conformance with the plan submitted and approved by the board.

1896
03:00:19,706 --> 03:00:24,329
And we'll put in the name of the subdivision plan and the final revision date.

1897
03:00:24,369 --> 03:00:27,412
The plan I have is a final revision date of 8-4-20.

1898
03:00:27,432 --> 03:00:31,495
Um, but I would confirm with you all that that's correct.

1899
03:00:32,196 --> 03:00:37,780
And this is for the, um, the Winthrop Estates Definitive Subdivision of Land.

1900
03:00:38,641 --> 03:00:41,363
I take it that is the plan that this is going to be bound to.

1901
03:00:41,990 --> 03:00:43,190
Is that correct, Tim?

1902
03:00:45,771 --> 03:00:48,551
That the plan is the one dated 8-4-20?

1903
03:00:48,571 --> 03:00:50,972
Let me double check.

1904
03:00:52,852 --> 03:00:58,613
And we can always verify, but just that the final submitted version of the plan is what they're going to build consistent with.

1905
03:00:59,633 --> 03:01:07,435
Are there any other documents that the board is expecting the project will be built consistent with other than the definitive subdivision plan that they

1906
03:01:08,921 --> 03:01:12,782
I know there's been renderings, but they're not, I'm assuming you're not holding them to the.

1907
03:01:14,943 --> 03:01:15,943
No pictures.

1908
03:01:15,963 --> 03:01:16,283
Okay.

1909
03:01:16,323 --> 03:01:29,086
So just the plan, just confirming that, um, there was a note earlier from Tim and I just want to make sure this gets in it, that there needs to be a plan revision regarding the sewer services for five 35 and five 55 that they'd be shown on the plan.

1910
03:01:29,106 --> 03:01:30,506
Yep.

1911
03:01:31,567 --> 03:01:31,907
Okay.

1912
03:01:32,347 --> 03:01:32,467
Um,

1913
03:01:33,618 --> 03:01:45,520
I may, in the final revising of this, just tweak the language a little bit about the surety that's necessary to construct the ways just so that it follows the statute and the subdivision regulations.

1914
03:01:45,861 --> 03:01:49,861
The applicant does have a right to choose what combination of surety they want to provide.

1915
03:01:50,201 --> 03:01:51,402
So I just wanted to comment on that.

1916
03:01:52,402 --> 03:01:54,142
We talked about the blasting schedule.

1917
03:01:54,202 --> 03:01:57,443
You're going to add the high school to the pre-certification list for blasting.

1918
03:01:59,248 --> 03:02:16,841
um that there needs to be a reference to the board's decision as conditioned on the plan and the decision itself will need to be recorded at the registry of deeds to bind the project so that can go in as a condition um let me just look at my notes real quick i think we covered everything else

1919
03:02:17,581 --> 03:02:33,096
The only other things I had, if you don't mind, if the board wants to, is I had flagged a couple of the conditions in Tim's suggested conditions that aren't tied to specific performance dates, and I didn't know if the board wanted to take a quick look and just confirm by when some of those things need to happen.

1920
03:02:34,057 --> 03:02:36,419
So if you'll bear with me, I can tell you them pretty quickly.

1921
03:02:36,439 --> 03:02:36,860
Okay.

1922
03:02:37,720 --> 03:02:42,945
But I would hate to have confusion later because there's a condition and we don't know what the deadline is to do it.

1923
03:02:44,466 --> 03:02:48,870
So if you guys have Tim's letter, I have his recommended conditions.

1924
03:02:49,631 --> 03:02:50,531
Two's coming out.

1925
03:02:50,892 --> 03:02:57,437
Number three talks about the blast control plan.

1926
03:02:58,939 --> 03:03:00,720
When does that need to happen by?

1927
03:03:02,102 --> 03:03:03,603
Just prior to any blasting.

1928
03:03:06,900 --> 03:03:07,841
It was submitted.

1929
03:03:07,861 --> 03:03:10,143
Oh, it's already done.

1930
03:03:10,363 --> 03:03:11,284
OK, never mind.

1931
03:03:11,364 --> 03:03:15,367
I think what we were asking for was advance notice.

1932
03:03:15,527 --> 03:03:19,310
And Mr. Chaffee said that he'd submit the calendar.

1933
03:03:23,194 --> 03:03:32,641
Number four, is that prior to building permit, prior to the final built conditions of the roadway lighting equipment inspected and approved?

1934
03:03:34,643 --> 03:03:35,624
When does that happen by?

1935
03:03:36,712 --> 03:03:38,333
That would be the something at the very end.

1936
03:03:38,633 --> 03:03:43,575
So just to point out that there's an entity that would approve that work that isn't engineering.

1937
03:03:45,375 --> 03:03:51,318
Okay, within two years as is, it would be within there's a two year time period unless we get an extension.

1938
03:03:51,378 --> 03:03:52,738
So it will be within those two years.

1939
03:03:53,639 --> 03:03:55,199
Okay, I thank you.

1940
03:03:57,000 --> 03:04:02,942
I just have a couple more and forgive me, I'm somewhat new to the to your particular regulation.

1941
03:04:02,982 --> 03:04:04,023
So I'm just being careful.

1942
03:04:05,598 --> 03:04:08,861
Number seven, when does the HOA need to be created by?

1943
03:04:08,881 --> 03:04:11,804
Is that prior to first sale?

1944
03:04:12,625 --> 03:04:12,885
Yes.

1945
03:04:14,126 --> 03:04:14,466
Okay.

1946
03:04:20,332 --> 03:04:21,473
Let's see, number eight.

1947
03:04:24,015 --> 03:04:27,819
Has this already been done or is the SWIFT going to be reviewed at some point?

1948
03:04:29,500 --> 03:04:30,221
It will be reviewed.

1949
03:04:31,524 --> 03:04:33,364
I don't know, Tim, do you have?

1950
03:04:33,484 --> 03:04:36,205
That would be prior to even starting anything.

1951
03:04:37,265 --> 03:04:37,705
That's correct.

1952
03:04:37,725 --> 03:04:38,346
Prior to road?

1953
03:04:38,966 --> 03:04:39,226
Yeah.

1954
03:04:39,246 --> 03:04:44,107
So prior to even... So it was prior to beginning any construction?

1955
03:04:44,787 --> 03:04:45,607
That's correct, yep.

1956
03:04:46,347 --> 03:04:46,427
Okay.

1957
03:04:46,467 --> 03:04:47,207
All right.

1958
03:04:47,407 --> 03:04:48,168
Just making a note of that.

1959
03:04:48,188 --> 03:04:49,128
I just have a couple more.

1960
03:04:49,148 --> 03:04:52,068
Number 11.

1961
03:04:55,829 --> 03:04:58,970
Is this what you said was already done or is this something that still needs to be done?

1962
03:05:02,542 --> 03:05:05,483
the inspection of the main?

1963
03:05:05,523 --> 03:05:09,104
We did the water one, this would be an inspection of the time point of the sewer main.

1964
03:05:10,124 --> 03:05:11,645
When is this need to be done by?

1965
03:05:12,925 --> 03:05:15,706
When they're ready to install the sewer connection.

1966
03:05:16,586 --> 03:05:19,027
It would have to happen prior to the connection.

1967
03:05:19,047 --> 03:05:22,788
Okay, so we'll just put prior to installation of sewer connection?

1968
03:05:23,228 --> 03:05:23,448
Yep.

1969
03:05:24,508 --> 03:05:26,048
All right, I just have three more.

1970
03:05:26,789 --> 03:05:26,989
Number 16,

1971
03:05:34,466 --> 03:05:37,428
That's gonna be something we have to provide them, so.

1972
03:05:37,988 --> 03:05:39,288
Okay, so just leave it as is?

1973
03:05:39,769 --> 03:05:42,210
Yep.

1974
03:05:43,330 --> 03:05:48,013
All right, 17, by when do you need, oh, it says prior to construction, I'm sorry, I missed that.

1975
03:05:48,573 --> 03:05:53,676
And then number 21, the rodent plan, what's the timing on that?

1976
03:05:57,438 --> 03:05:58,878
Sorry, that's prior to construction.

1977
03:05:59,379 --> 03:06:01,600
Yeah, that's another prior to construction one, yep.

1978
03:06:02,745 --> 03:06:04,226
Those are the only ones I had on that.

1979
03:06:04,346 --> 03:06:06,366
I think we've covered all my other notes.

1980
03:06:08,787 --> 03:06:09,827
I just wanted to make sure.

1981
03:06:09,847 --> 03:06:22,692
So, you know, when the motion on this will be to incorporate all of the conditions that have been discussed with the board tonight, including those administrative conditions that Annie read and that cover the department comments.

1982
03:06:23,392 --> 03:06:25,613
So just make sure, is everyone clear on that?

1983
03:06:26,213 --> 03:06:31,215
All of those things will ultimately become the conditions in the decision that the chair will finalize.

1984
03:06:35,310 --> 03:06:39,573
Yes, I think there's been so much that I'm just trying to keep it clear.

1985
03:06:40,773 --> 03:06:42,074
I have a question for clarity.

1986
03:06:42,094 --> 03:06:45,095
Go ahead, Jackie.

1987
03:06:45,796 --> 03:06:47,597
And that's going back to the blasting plan.

1988
03:06:47,677 --> 03:06:56,381
I know that's going to be submitted to Alicia Hunt, who's the Acting Community Development Department's Director.

1989
03:06:56,541 --> 03:07:01,964
But how is that actually shared with the community?

1990
03:07:04,689 --> 03:07:07,110
Is there a schedule in place as of right now?

1991
03:07:07,170 --> 03:07:09,210
Like for instance, are they blasting right now?

1992
03:07:09,410 --> 03:07:17,113
Is this something that the waypoint is communicating with the community before they blast?

1993
03:07:17,153 --> 03:07:21,094
I'm just trying to get a little, because from what my understanding, blasting is happening.

1994
03:07:21,514 --> 03:07:22,814
So what is this blasting plan?

1995
03:07:22,854 --> 03:07:23,995
Is it being upgraded?

1996
03:07:24,995 --> 03:07:26,976
Are we telling them that they can't blast prior to?

1997
03:07:26,996 --> 03:07:28,676
So I'm just, I just need clarity around that.

1998
03:07:28,696 --> 03:07:31,337
Do you want to explain Mr. Champy?

1999
03:07:32,564 --> 03:07:34,184
So yeah, we are not blasting now.

2000
03:07:35,665 --> 03:07:41,266
In our past, what we did was when we were preparing to blast for the drainage testing, we sent out mailings.

2001
03:07:41,526 --> 03:07:44,686
We mailed the complete abutters list and flyered the houses.

2002
03:07:45,587 --> 03:07:50,148
I think it was, it might've been three or four days prior to the blasting taking place.

2003
03:07:50,188 --> 03:07:51,808
That's just a procedural thing that we do.

2004
03:07:53,548 --> 03:08:02,070
So in going forward, we would schedule the work pending approval, of course, and any waiting periods related to it.

2005
03:08:02,978 --> 03:08:08,102
And so we've been corresponding with the entire abutters list.

2006
03:08:08,782 --> 03:08:16,568
Every time we go back on the site, we've been corresponding with the abutters list just to keep people from being overly concerned that they might have think work started and work stopped.

2007
03:08:16,608 --> 03:08:19,290
So we've explained what we're doing when we're going on and off the site.

2008
03:08:20,591 --> 03:08:21,772
So we'll continue that.

2009
03:08:22,773 --> 03:08:24,614
So maybe we should just say, be clear and say.

2010
03:08:24,634 --> 03:08:30,898
I actually want to just clarify that because the abutters list is an official list.

2011
03:08:30,958 --> 03:08:31,679
It's a radius.

2012
03:08:32,447 --> 03:08:35,928
And that's what he has been legally obligated to.

2013
03:08:36,008 --> 03:08:54,194
What we're asking is that he notify our office and we will arrange for a broader communication through the city's reverse 911 emergency alert system so that, and we'll try to determine that in-house whether that's.

2014
03:08:58,356 --> 03:09:08,064
She froze, she doesn't look- He says he's notified that there's a significantly larger radius than is getting the mailings about the blasting.

2015
03:09:08,084 --> 03:09:24,158
Right, but I think- Right, he's committed to giving us a schedule, a generalized schedule, and then making sure that he notifies us about each blast, and we'll do a call to a larger area.

2016
03:09:25,181 --> 03:09:25,341
Right.

2017
03:09:25,361 --> 03:09:34,129
So we should just be clear in the condition that at least three days before any blasting occurs, we will have an updated blasting calendar or schedule.

2018
03:09:36,602 --> 03:09:37,803
Thank you for clarifying.

2019
03:09:37,843 --> 03:09:42,545
I was trying to get more of a feel of the public input and seeing if that had been a problem.

2020
03:09:42,945 --> 03:09:51,990
And it seems like Mr. Donovan, which I know has been a huge champion, or well, has been a huge opposer prior to, seems to be pleased going forward now.

2021
03:09:52,070 --> 03:10:00,134
So I'm going to take that as Waypoint has been doing what it's supposed to for the community, but I just wanted to know how we were going to move forward with it.

2022
03:10:01,595 --> 03:10:01,915
Thank you.

2023
03:10:04,296 --> 03:10:04,657
All right.

2024
03:10:06,063 --> 03:10:09,484
Do we have a, so I think the motion on the floor will be to.

2025
03:10:09,504 --> 03:10:16,285
You just want to, did you just want to confirm there was no additional final public comment?

2026
03:10:18,926 --> 03:10:23,826
Uh, any additional public comments we've been taking public.

2027
03:10:25,327 --> 03:10:25,767
Thank you.

2028
03:10:26,307 --> 03:10:31,368
Um, let me close the public portion of the, of the hearing and

2029
03:10:32,873 --> 03:10:35,414
move to the motions on the floor.

2030
03:10:35,435 --> 03:10:36,275
There will be three.

2031
03:10:36,575 --> 03:10:38,616
One will be the waiver for the turning radii.

2032
03:10:39,397 --> 03:10:42,038
Second will be to approve the subdivision.

2033
03:10:42,759 --> 03:10:46,541
And the third will be to approve a site plan.

2034
03:10:48,482 --> 03:10:52,884
So is there a motion on the waiver?

2035
03:10:53,465 --> 03:11:02,250
Again, this is the waiver to waive the 30 foot turning radii.

2036
03:11:04,311 --> 03:11:07,972
for a 20 foot turning radii at Mary Kelly Way.

2037
03:11:10,493 --> 03:11:14,655
And is it my understanding that's based on the board's finding that this is safer at 20 feet?

2038
03:11:15,215 --> 03:11:15,415
Yes.

2039
03:11:16,476 --> 03:11:17,096
Okay, thank you.

2040
03:11:19,077 --> 03:11:20,417
Do you want me to suggest a motion?

2041
03:11:20,918 --> 03:11:21,598
That would be great.

2042
03:11:21,738 --> 03:11:22,018
Thank you.

2043
03:11:22,637 --> 03:11:46,696
Okay, and feel free, Tim, to jump in if there's anything technical you want to add, but the motion would be to approve the requested waiver relating to reducing the required radii from 30 feet to 20 feet, where that will result in a safer design and thus is in the public interest and not inconsistent with the intent and purpose of the subdivision control law.

2044
03:11:50,258 --> 03:11:50,839
Thank you, Robin.

2045
03:11:54,248 --> 03:11:56,409
Do we have a member willing to make the motion?

2046
03:12:01,612 --> 03:12:02,412
And you can keep it simple.

2047
03:12:02,432 --> 03:12:03,292
You can say so moved.

2048
03:12:03,332 --> 03:12:03,612
Yes.

2049
03:12:04,273 --> 03:12:04,493
So moved.

2050
03:12:04,533 --> 03:12:05,954
You can say so moved if you'd like.

2051
03:12:06,974 --> 03:12:08,975
So moved by what Attorney Robin.

2052
03:12:09,695 --> 03:12:10,536
I apologize, Robin.

2053
03:12:10,556 --> 03:12:11,916
I don't have your last name.

2054
03:12:11,956 --> 03:12:12,257
Stein.

2055
03:12:12,277 --> 03:12:12,457
Stein.

2056
03:12:12,477 --> 03:12:12,797
That's OK.

2057
03:12:12,817 --> 03:12:13,817
You can just say so moved.

2058
03:12:14,638 --> 03:12:15,058
So moved.

2059
03:12:16,219 --> 03:12:16,819
Is there a second?

2060
03:12:19,240 --> 03:12:19,780
I'll second.

2061
03:12:19,820 --> 03:12:20,361
This is Deanna.

2062
03:12:20,621 --> 03:12:21,341
Thank you, Deanna.

2063
03:12:22,642 --> 03:12:23,342
Roll call vote.

2064
03:12:24,756 --> 03:12:25,377
Deanna Peabody.

2065
03:12:26,337 --> 03:12:26,437
Aye.

2066
03:12:27,378 --> 03:12:27,978
Christy Dowd.

2067
03:12:28,819 --> 03:12:28,959
Aye.

2068
03:12:29,599 --> 03:12:30,320
Les Andresen.

2069
03:12:31,240 --> 03:12:31,360
Aye.

2070
03:12:31,901 --> 03:12:32,701
Jackie Furtado.

2071
03:12:33,242 --> 03:12:33,382
Aye.

2072
03:12:33,842 --> 03:12:34,502
David Blumberg.

2073
03:12:35,323 --> 03:12:35,463
Aye.

2074
03:12:36,283 --> 03:12:37,464
And I'm an aye as well.

2075
03:12:37,824 --> 03:12:38,165
Thank you.

2076
03:12:38,865 --> 03:12:40,246
Vote six, zero.

2077
03:12:40,806 --> 03:12:42,487
The waiver unanimously passes.

2078
03:12:45,850 --> 03:12:51,193
The next motion would be to approve the subdivision

2079
03:12:52,373 --> 03:12:55,874
with the conditions discussed by the board this evening.

2080
03:12:58,335 --> 03:13:01,036
Is there a motion on the floor?

2081
03:13:04,577 --> 03:13:05,637
Would you like me to suggest it?

2082
03:13:05,717 --> 03:13:06,337
I'll make a motion.

2083
03:13:06,357 --> 03:13:07,018
Okay, go ahead.

2084
03:13:09,098 --> 03:13:10,419
You can certainly suggest it.

2085
03:13:11,299 --> 03:13:12,299
Oh, no, no, go ahead, go ahead.

2086
03:13:12,419 --> 03:13:14,440
Sorry, there was a pause, so I thought I'd offer.

2087
03:13:14,720 --> 03:13:15,540
Go ahead, I don't need.

2088
03:13:17,601 --> 03:13:20,342
I make a motion to approve the subdivision with the

2089
03:13:22,534 --> 03:13:25,376
conditions outlined tonight.

2090
03:13:26,996 --> 03:13:30,899
And can I do that in subject to final approval of the written decision by the chair?

2091
03:13:32,780 --> 03:13:37,362
Final to written final decision by the chair?

2092
03:13:38,143 --> 03:13:41,424
Yeah, subject to final written approval by the chair.

2093
03:13:41,444 --> 03:13:42,425
I think that was the language.

2094
03:13:42,445 --> 03:13:44,446
Subject to final written approval by the chair.

2095
03:13:45,306 --> 03:13:45,687
Thank you.

2096
03:13:45,867 --> 03:13:47,908
The chair is going to review the final decision before it's filed.

2097
03:13:49,631 --> 03:13:50,392
Is there a second?

2098
03:13:51,032 --> 03:13:52,253
Andrea, I'll second that.

2099
03:13:52,894 --> 03:13:53,474
Thank you, David.

2100
03:13:54,214 --> 03:13:54,955
Roll call vote.

2101
03:13:55,135 --> 03:13:56,316
Go ahead.

2102
03:13:56,396 --> 03:14:02,300
Can I just clarify that's subject to all of the conditions identified, discussed, and referenced by the board during the remand public hearing.

2103
03:14:03,401 --> 03:14:03,721
Thank you.

2104
03:14:04,302 --> 03:14:07,744
It's helpful to have a counsel with us during these meetings.

2105
03:14:08,185 --> 03:14:09,406
I feel bad to keep interrupting.

2106
03:14:09,466 --> 03:14:10,827
It's very awkward over Zoom, but.

2107
03:14:11,147 --> 03:14:14,990
Well, I'm a new chair, and many of the members are new members.

2108
03:14:15,030 --> 03:14:17,191
So we're all kind of been learning as we go.

2109
03:14:17,211 --> 03:14:19,133
So it's helpful to have a counsel with us.

2110
03:14:20,624 --> 03:14:21,304
Deanna Peabody.

2111
03:14:21,944 --> 03:14:22,085
Aye.

2112
03:14:23,465 --> 03:14:24,026
Christy Dowd.

2113
03:14:25,147 --> 03:14:25,287
Aye.

2114
03:14:26,047 --> 03:14:26,828
Klaas Andreasen.

2115
03:14:29,730 --> 03:14:29,850
Aye.

2116
03:14:30,810 --> 03:14:31,591
Jackie Purtado.

2117
03:14:32,111 --> 03:14:32,271
Aye.

2118
03:14:33,172 --> 03:14:33,832
David Bloomberg.

2119
03:14:34,493 --> 03:14:34,693
Aye.

2120
03:14:35,354 --> 03:14:36,414
And I vote aye as well.

2121
03:14:37,835 --> 03:14:40,457
The motion unanimously passes six to zero.

2122
03:14:40,797 --> 03:14:41,137
Thank you.

2123
03:14:42,058 --> 03:14:47,662
And the final motion is to approve the site plan

2124
03:14:48,422 --> 03:14:49,182
for the project.

2125
03:14:49,763 --> 03:14:53,584
Why don't I just go ahead and ask you, Attorney Stein, to suggest the motion.

2126
03:14:54,825 --> 03:14:56,265
I would actually just use the same motion.

2127
03:14:56,325 --> 03:15:08,611
I would say a motion to approve the application for a site plan special permit subject to all of the conditions identified, discussed, and referenced by the board during the remaining public hearing, and subject to final approval of the written decision by the chair.

2128
03:15:08,651 --> 03:15:10,051
So the same motion as the previous.

2129
03:15:11,532 --> 03:15:13,013
Those words don't want to roll off your tongue.

2130
03:15:13,073 --> 03:15:13,613
It's wonderful.

2131
03:15:15,073 --> 03:15:16,094
I wrote it out in advance.

2132
03:15:17,550 --> 03:15:18,350
Who said so moved?

2133
03:15:18,370 --> 03:15:18,891
My secret.

2134
03:15:19,571 --> 03:15:20,332
Okay, Kless, thank you.

2135
03:15:20,372 --> 03:15:20,992
Is there a second?

2136
03:15:21,853 --> 03:15:22,253
Second.

2137
03:15:23,154 --> 03:15:23,895
Jackie, thank you.

2138
03:15:24,095 --> 03:15:24,835
A roll call vote.

2139
03:15:24,915 --> 03:15:25,576
Deanna Peabody?

2140
03:15:25,596 --> 03:15:26,416
Aye.

2141
03:15:27,077 --> 03:15:27,637
Christy Dowd?

2142
03:15:28,798 --> 03:15:28,918
Aye.

2143
03:15:29,619 --> 03:15:30,359
Kless Andresen?

2144
03:15:31,140 --> 03:15:31,220
Aye.

2145
03:15:31,800 --> 03:15:32,601
Jackie Purtado?

2146
03:15:33,161 --> 03:15:33,302
Aye.

2147
03:15:33,962 --> 03:15:34,603
David Blumberg?

2148
03:15:35,443 --> 03:15:35,583
Aye.

2149
03:15:36,004 --> 03:15:37,024
And I vote aye as well.

2150
03:15:37,104 --> 03:15:39,866
So the motion unanimously passes six to zero.

2151
03:15:39,987 --> 03:15:40,567
Thank you, everyone.

2152
03:15:41,573 --> 03:15:47,617
And I'll just remind the board that under the remand order, the decision needs to be followed with the city clerk in 30 days.

2153
03:15:49,478 --> 03:15:49,778
Thank you.

2154
03:15:51,299 --> 03:15:54,621
And Mr. Champey and your team, I know it's been a long process.

2155
03:15:54,961 --> 03:15:59,364
Thank you for working with us through it and best of luck.

2156
03:16:00,024 --> 03:16:01,425
Can I just make a last comment too?

2157
03:16:02,566 --> 03:16:04,327
Absolutely, Chris, go ahead.

2158
03:16:04,787 --> 03:16:10,251
Mr. Champey, I want to thank you for the work you put in and especially the end there, I think,

2159
03:16:11,244 --> 03:16:26,497
the inclusion of the renderings and your ability to translate what I was suggesting into what we saw tonight, I thought was a really helpful addition to get to where we are now.

2160
03:16:26,597 --> 03:16:28,038
So thank you and good luck.

2161
03:16:28,799 --> 03:16:29,840
Thank you very much, everybody.

2162
03:16:29,860 --> 03:16:30,460
I appreciate it.

2163
03:16:31,681 --> 03:16:31,982
Thank you.

2164
03:16:32,682 --> 03:16:33,203
Good luck.

2165
03:16:33,583 --> 03:16:33,963
Bye-bye.

2166
03:16:37,466 --> 03:16:37,787
All right.

2167
03:16:40,587 --> 03:16:42,428
Next item on our agenda.

2168
03:16:45,189 --> 03:16:49,791
And if you don't need me to stay on, then I'm going to jump off as well, unless you'd like me to.

2169
03:16:49,871 --> 03:16:52,852
I'm not familiar with what else is on your agenda.

2170
03:16:53,733 --> 03:16:54,953
I did a site plan review.

2171
03:16:54,973 --> 03:16:55,674
I think we're fine.

2172
03:16:55,694 --> 03:16:57,774
OK, excellent.

2173
03:16:58,135 --> 03:16:59,575
It was great to meet all of you.

2174
03:16:59,655 --> 03:17:00,035
Thank you.

2175
03:17:00,396 --> 03:17:01,256
Thanks so much for your help.

2176
03:17:01,356 --> 03:17:01,976
I'll follow up.

2177
03:17:02,256 --> 03:17:02,556
Thank you.

2178
03:17:03,417 --> 03:17:04,257
Thank you for your help.

2179
03:17:05,478 --> 03:17:06,058
Thank you all.

2180
03:17:11,443 --> 03:17:15,007
All right, so we have the next item on our agenda.

2181
03:17:15,027 --> 03:17:21,033
The final one is our site plan review recommendation to the Board of Appeals for 30 to 36 Salem Street.

2182
03:17:23,996 --> 03:17:28,840
Thank you again, everybody for your patience and hanging in there while we have a long evening.

2183
03:17:29,922 --> 03:17:31,183
Could I ask the proponent of

2184
03:17:31,643 --> 03:17:36,124
of the Salem Street project to present their proposal.

2185
03:17:36,505 --> 03:17:38,925
Good evening, Chairman LaRue and board members.

2186
03:17:38,965 --> 03:17:41,586
My name is Kathleen Desmond of Conway Law.

2187
03:17:42,666 --> 03:17:47,448
I am here tonight on the site plan review and special permit recommendations.

2188
03:17:47,848 --> 03:17:54,390
The petitioner, Paul Connolly, the manager of 34th Salem Street LLC, is here with me along with the design team.

2189
03:17:54,884 --> 03:18:08,333
project manager Anthony Esposito of Carver Masks, Richard Mead of Medford Engineering and Survey, architect Eric Zachrisson of Context in Boston, and the traffic engineer Jeffrey Dirk of Van Essen Associates out of Andover.

2190
03:18:09,153 --> 03:18:14,717
I'll provide a brief background to the board members, and then turn the presentation over to the design team.

2191
03:18:15,957 --> 03:18:22,281
I believe that you are all likely familiar with the project site, 3036 Salem Street, located within Medford Square.

2192
03:18:23,497 --> 03:18:24,937
and the C1 zoning district.

2193
03:18:25,377 --> 03:18:32,419
The existing structure that will be the subject of renovation sits on a 13,910 square foot parcel of land.

2194
03:18:32,879 --> 03:18:40,120
The building itself was built in approximately 1915 and originally housed a theater as well as meeting and commercial space.

2195
03:18:40,580 --> 03:18:45,141
Originally, the building extended well into the rear of the property where the parking area is now situated.

2196
03:18:45,861 --> 03:18:52,662
When Mr. Connelly's family bought the property in the mid-1980s, they intended to revive the theater

2197
03:18:53,092 --> 03:18:58,054
and also have live performances, such as what goes on with the Chevalier Theatre at this point.

2198
03:18:58,554 --> 03:19:06,377
Following the Connelly's family acquisition of the property, it was discovered that the rear portion of the structure was in greater disrepair than they had originally believed.

2199
03:19:06,857 --> 03:19:12,119
Ultimately, portions of the rear property were in a state of collapse, and the rear portion of the property was demolished.

2200
03:19:12,972 --> 03:19:15,694
For most of their ownership, the building has been underutilized.

2201
03:19:16,075 --> 03:19:19,778
The first and second floor is being occupied by commercial and retail uses.

2202
03:19:20,278 --> 03:19:25,062
Longstanding tenants, Elizabeth Grady and H&R Block, occupy the first floor.

2203
03:19:25,523 --> 03:19:28,905
And most recently, Yoga Studio has occupied the second floor.

2204
03:19:29,426 --> 03:19:36,712
The third floor has not been utilized over the years due to a combination of demand for commercial space and the cost of necessary improvements.

2205
03:19:37,165 --> 03:19:37,926
as to access.

2206
03:19:38,886 --> 03:19:50,254
A little over a year ago, some of you may recall that this property was under agreement and that a development came before you for approval of a much larger building.

2207
03:19:50,754 --> 03:19:55,558
It was six stories in height and contained 20 residential units.

2208
03:19:55,998 --> 03:20:04,864
The board did act favorably on that petition, but the purchaser, without much explanation, did not go through the final process to the Zoning Board of Appeals.

2209
03:20:05,647 --> 03:20:11,250
After that point, my clients considered renovating the building themselves, and here we are at this point.

2210
03:20:12,050 --> 03:20:18,973
The project is much less imposing than the building that was originally suggested for this.

2211
03:20:19,073 --> 03:20:24,155
It's four stories, three stories of residential use with one floor of commercial use.

2212
03:20:25,316 --> 03:20:34,880
The footprint of the building will marginally be extended to include a trash room, bicycle area, and also a residential lobby.

2213
03:20:36,594 --> 03:20:46,479
The structure as proposed preserves many of the historical features of the building and will recreate the marquee signage which the historical commission has noted.

2214
03:20:47,379 --> 03:20:58,125
As to the zoning requirements, and I can address this after the design team moves forward, essentially the use of a residential and a commercial use is permitted in the C1 district.

2215
03:20:59,085 --> 03:21:02,727
There are dimensional variances which will be required as to set back with

2216
03:21:03,943 --> 03:21:05,324
and also lot coverage.

2217
03:21:06,064 --> 03:21:13,206
The parking situation, there's an existing lot which is not conforming to the requirements of Medford zoning.

2218
03:21:13,747 --> 03:21:24,190
We would also need a finding to keep that parking space as is, it's a net loss of one space because this actually uses less than the commercial use for an entire building.

2219
03:21:24,710 --> 03:21:30,092
So with that, I'll turn it over to the design team, Tony Esposito.

2220
03:21:37,607 --> 03:21:38,888
He's still muted, I believe.

2221
03:21:38,908 --> 03:21:46,931
I think Annie's looking for him.

2222
03:21:48,132 --> 03:21:50,212
He's, I can't point to where you are.

2223
03:21:51,613 --> 03:21:51,913
Okay.

2224
03:21:53,154 --> 03:21:54,834
He's four down on Hollywood Squares.

2225
03:22:00,417 --> 03:22:01,357
Can anybody hear me?

2226
03:22:02,037 --> 03:22:02,898
Now we can, yes.

2227
03:22:04,320 --> 03:22:05,261
Good evening, everybody.

2228
03:22:06,061 --> 03:22:07,562
My name is Anthony Esposito.

2229
03:22:07,582 --> 03:22:10,724
I'm a registered professional engineer in the state of Massachusetts.

2230
03:22:11,805 --> 03:22:18,009
It is an honor and a privilege to be in front of the Community Development Board of the great city of Bedford.

2231
03:22:21,872 --> 03:22:32,479
To move it along here, as Kathleen told you, this was a project for 30 to 36 Salem Street on the north side of Salem Street.

2232
03:22:33,291 --> 03:22:49,065
The proposal is to maintain 18 parking spaces in the rear with an ADA accessible, van accessible space as required by the AAB regulations.

2233
03:22:49,973 --> 03:22:50,593
in the rear.

2234
03:22:51,794 --> 03:22:55,856
If I could interrupt for just one moment, we can put the site plan up.

2235
03:22:55,876 --> 03:22:57,797
Would that be easier for you, Tony?

2236
03:22:57,817 --> 03:22:59,338
Yeah, that would be helpful.

2237
03:22:59,458 --> 03:23:04,380
Joe, I'm not as good of a tool that I can be.

2238
03:23:04,440 --> 03:23:09,503
I believe Eric has the site plan, I believe.

2239
03:23:10,964 --> 03:23:11,244
Eric?

2240
03:23:16,246 --> 03:23:17,267
He needs to be unmuted.

2241
03:23:18,707 --> 03:23:19,668
He's our architect.

2242
03:23:21,860 --> 03:23:23,103
Yeah, I think you're unmuted now.

2243
03:23:23,765 --> 03:23:26,172
Yeah, if you could make me a co-host, I can share my screen.

2244
03:23:44,618 --> 03:23:58,610
Okay, so if we were to move over towards the proposed section, in the existing section, regarding the existing parking lot, right now there's a sea of pavement back there.

2245
03:23:59,752 --> 03:24:07,899
And when we design the new parking lot, we're looking to add a little landscape islands.

2246
03:24:08,877 --> 03:24:14,862
both as you, if you can move the arrow towards the left of the property there or where the hilly section is.

2247
03:24:16,403 --> 03:24:17,204
Right in there, yes.

2248
03:24:17,744 --> 03:24:21,588
That area right now is all roughly fallow soil.

2249
03:24:21,608 --> 03:24:27,793
We're planning on landscaping and seeding that area to green it up a bit.

2250
03:24:28,594 --> 03:24:36,160
And then if you move over to the rear left corner of the property up against the wall, that area right there we're planning to

2251
03:24:36,765 --> 03:24:49,012
put some seating there as well, and we'll be adding some Cape Cod burn around that square, if you will, to protect it from tires just running it over.

2252
03:24:49,873 --> 03:24:58,778
So... Let me do it again.

2253
03:25:00,002 --> 03:25:03,004
Yeah, hold on, Mr. Esposito, you've been muted.

2254
03:25:03,104 --> 03:25:07,186
Sorry, I meant to mute Eric, because there was sound coming.

2255
03:25:07,266 --> 03:25:10,248
The whining was from one of them, and I hit the wrong one.

2256
03:25:10,288 --> 03:25:11,268
I apologize.

2257
03:25:12,289 --> 03:25:18,652
Yeah, so Mr. Esposito, you've got a lot of background high-pitched sound coming through your side.

2258
03:25:18,792 --> 03:25:20,393
The computer's fan is running.

2259
03:25:22,054 --> 03:25:23,215
Can't do anything about it.

2260
03:25:27,317 --> 03:25:28,918
Anyway, moving along.

2261
03:25:30,108 --> 03:25:31,689
We talked about the landscaping.

2262
03:25:33,250 --> 03:25:36,231
These are a couple of things I check for in every site plan I do.

2263
03:25:36,251 --> 03:25:38,212
We're not in a flood plain.

2264
03:25:38,692 --> 03:25:41,973
We obviously don't have any endangered species areas.

2265
03:25:42,033 --> 03:25:44,594
There's no wetlands within 100 feet of the area.

2266
03:25:46,055 --> 03:25:48,416
We're not in a groundwater protection district.

2267
03:25:50,242 --> 03:25:52,504
So those issues have gone haywire.

2268
03:25:52,864 --> 03:26:00,570
I believe it's the intent of the applicant to reutilize some of the existing utilities that service the building right now.

2269
03:26:01,191 --> 03:26:17,485
However, there is a note on the plan that the city of Medford can, upon review of the existing utilities they plan to use, that they can ask the applicant to change

2270
03:26:18,390 --> 03:26:20,732
the utilities and make them brand new.

2271
03:26:22,093 --> 03:26:28,039
And that would be the domestic water and the sanitary sewer.

2272
03:26:29,800 --> 03:26:35,005
We are going to be providing sprinkler protection for the building.

2273
03:26:35,225 --> 03:26:42,812
And for that, we need to tap in a four-inch ductile ion pipe in the existing main on Salem Street.

2274
03:26:45,067 --> 03:26:55,511
We've gotten some feedback from the town engineer, and he's probably out there in the crowd, I'm sure, that he would like to see valves put on each side of the connection.

2275
03:26:58,031 --> 03:27:12,676
I just want to, for the record, ask him to reconsider to allow us to do a live tap because to add in the two cross valves would require that we turn down

2276
03:27:13,422 --> 03:27:17,045
turn off the water main in order to do that.

2277
03:27:17,165 --> 03:27:19,527
With a live tap, we may not be able to do that.

2278
03:27:20,088 --> 03:27:31,798
However, one of the reasons that Tim may be hesitant to do that is maybe he feels the age of the existing water main on Salem Street could be an issue with a live tap.

2279
03:27:31,898 --> 03:27:33,019
That's also a concern.

2280
03:27:34,036 --> 03:27:40,441
So for the record, I'd like to ask Tim if he wants to reconsider just for the applicant's benefit.

2281
03:27:40,921 --> 03:27:46,325
And we can certainly understand if he doesn't want to reconsider.

2282
03:27:47,406 --> 03:27:51,049
We have on some of the later sheets, a construction management plan.

2283
03:27:51,209 --> 03:27:55,012
We plan on utilizing the existing drainage system on the site.

2284
03:27:56,305 --> 03:28:24,878
We believe we can do that because under stormwater management, if we're taking a site that has lots of impervious cover, rooftop, pavement, what have you, and you decrease it by adding some green space, then under stormwater management, you're considered a redevelopment and you're allowed to meet the standards to the extent practical

2285
03:28:26,347 --> 03:28:29,549
So we'd like to utilize the existing drainage system.

2286
03:28:29,729 --> 03:28:34,993
And to do that, we'd like to reduce the amount of impervious on the site.

2287
03:28:37,455 --> 03:28:39,876
But there will be some erosion control measures.

2288
03:28:40,397 --> 03:28:44,259
They're spelled out in the construction management plan on the plans.

2289
03:28:45,420 --> 03:28:55,647
The key thing is the drywalls on the site during construction will be fitted with silt sacks to collect any sediment during construction to protect them and allow them to do

2290
03:28:56,783 --> 03:28:58,084
the infiltration ability.

2291
03:29:01,646 --> 03:29:04,348
We will have some site lighting.

2292
03:29:06,069 --> 03:29:08,551
It is over the trash receptacles.

2293
03:29:09,752 --> 03:29:15,756
I'm requesting that the architect provide a wall pack light over where the trash receptacles are.

2294
03:29:15,776 --> 03:29:20,819
If you look at that, that's over on the rear left corner of the building.

2295
03:29:20,839 --> 03:29:22,460
You'll see the little squares there.

2296
03:29:23,340 --> 03:29:25,342
The request was we do roll out barrels.

2297
03:29:26,610 --> 03:29:27,891
put a bunch of them back there.

2298
03:29:28,672 --> 03:29:34,055
And we're also asking for a light pole in the middle of the parking area on the right side.

2299
03:29:35,156 --> 03:29:37,558
These will be kind of like a shoebox type.

2300
03:29:37,818 --> 03:29:45,804
So we're directing the light down towards the parking lot and not towards the neighbors.

2301
03:29:45,864 --> 03:29:46,725
That's the intent.

2302
03:29:48,346 --> 03:29:51,268
The most important thing we have to

2303
03:29:52,263 --> 03:29:56,906
deal with on the site is the access onto Salem Street.

2304
03:29:57,146 --> 03:30:09,634
We've been recommended by our traffic engineer to put multiple signage and I have detailed those on the sheet that's shown on the plan, on the sheet that's on the plan at this time.

2305
03:30:11,625 --> 03:30:18,209
The intent is to make them to MUTCD standards, i.e.

2306
03:30:18,250 --> 03:30:24,394
the state standards for highway signage with the wording recommended by the traffic engineer.

2307
03:30:25,394 --> 03:30:31,398
And we have four locations of signage.

2308
03:30:31,498 --> 03:30:38,143
Two of them are right on the corner of the building, on the right front corner.

2309
03:30:40,300 --> 03:30:47,623
The other one is on the rear left corner, which is sign number three, watch for pedestrians.

2310
03:30:49,143 --> 03:30:52,284
And we also have a sign for the van accessible sign as well.

2311
03:30:52,944 --> 03:31:06,329
There is also a proposed sign number four for the loading zone, which we are showing at the, that's the parking space off the right left corner.

2312
03:31:08,707 --> 03:31:18,334
So I'm just going to bump through my detail sheet to see if there's anything else I'd like to talk about, because I'm nearing pretty much the end.

2313
03:31:24,238 --> 03:31:25,579
And that's basically it.

2314
03:31:25,739 --> 03:31:30,883
We've got signage, we've got lighting, we've got some landscaping to add.

2315
03:31:34,896 --> 03:31:43,300
And also we have a sidewalk detail because any anticipated excavation into Salem Street, there's going to need to be some sidewalk repair of what's there now.

2316
03:31:44,260 --> 03:31:57,087
And when we do that, we're looking if there's what they call flags, the squares on concrete sidewalks, we have to repair the whole flag right to the expansion joint.

2317
03:31:59,568 --> 03:31:59,968
Okay.

2318
03:32:01,469 --> 03:32:04,190
And with that, I'm up for questions.

2319
03:32:05,590 --> 03:32:08,171
Well, is there more to the presentation?

2320
03:32:08,211 --> 03:32:08,591
Will we?

2321
03:32:09,592 --> 03:32:11,532
Yeah, the architect will take us through his.

2322
03:32:11,572 --> 03:32:12,493
Yeah, why don't we do that?

2323
03:32:13,213 --> 03:32:14,914
I'm going to mute you in the meantime, Mr. Esposito.

2324
03:32:14,954 --> 03:32:15,354
I'm sorry.

2325
03:32:15,794 --> 03:32:21,897
The winding sound is very difficult to deal with.

2326
03:32:24,478 --> 03:32:24,798
Thank you.

2327
03:32:26,018 --> 03:32:27,099
My name is Eric Zacherson.

2328
03:32:27,219 --> 03:32:30,380
I'm an architect, the architect for the project.

2329
03:32:30,440 --> 03:32:33,762
Our firm, Context, is located in Charlestown.

2330
03:32:36,465 --> 03:32:42,450
The project here, just for orientation, I like to always start at the big picture.

2331
03:32:42,470 --> 03:32:45,852
We've got the existing building.

2332
03:32:46,092 --> 03:32:48,874
You're probably all quite familiar with it on Salem Street.

2333
03:32:49,635 --> 03:32:59,142
An overview showing some of the quick, the information that Tony was talking about and its relationship to the rest of the city.

2334
03:33:00,803 --> 03:33:02,644
The building, as you see here,

2335
03:33:04,247 --> 03:33:20,402
Looking along Salem Street and looking the other direction, you can see the historic building as well as the small enclosure on the third floor that we'd be removing as part of the project.

2336
03:33:21,483 --> 03:33:25,307
Again, stepping back a little bit, looking towards Oakland and City Hall Mall.

2337
03:33:27,845 --> 03:33:29,606
and then zoomed in just a little bit.

2338
03:33:29,846 --> 03:33:37,650
For those of you who haven't been inside of it in a little while, there formerly was a toy shop in the middle.

2339
03:33:38,371 --> 03:33:42,873
There currently still is the H&R block on one side.

2340
03:33:42,893 --> 03:33:50,297
There used to be a yoga studio up here, a lovely space on the second floor, quite high ceilings.

2341
03:33:51,197 --> 03:33:55,720
Third floor has been in this condition for quite some time.

2342
03:33:57,014 --> 03:34:00,296
just never made sense to be used.

2343
03:34:00,816 --> 03:34:05,219
This is actually within that black box I was just showing you on the exterior.

2344
03:34:06,040 --> 03:34:16,746
As Kathleen noted, the building has been, at least the third floor has been underutilized since the Connellys took over.

2345
03:34:16,766 --> 03:34:25,472
This is a quick shot of the rear yard or the rear parking as it exists today and was formerly part of the building.

2346
03:34:27,756 --> 03:34:38,464
The current owners who are redeveloping it have always been in love with this building and its history, and it's part of this stretch of Medford.

2347
03:34:38,484 --> 03:34:48,331
And so we always kind of want to flip back to some of these images and think about them as we think about what we're going to do with the project.

2348
03:34:49,852 --> 03:34:51,053
Currently, as you see, the building

2349
03:34:54,314 --> 03:34:58,657
The extent of the existing building is up to this line here at the back of the site.

2350
03:34:58,957 --> 03:35:09,563
H&R block occupies this space, which is, as you're facing the building, the right side of the building, and Elizabeth Grady faces the left side of the building.

2351
03:35:11,244 --> 03:35:22,030
As part of the work here, we would renovate these two storefronts to be something that's a little more energy efficient and create a central entrance with

2352
03:35:23,426 --> 03:35:38,996
which you would access, then you would have access to each retail space and you would also rejuvenate the retail space that was formerly the toy store and was also the access to the yoga studio.

2353
03:35:39,637 --> 03:35:50,263
We would create, by adding on to the back of the building here, we would create a residential lobby, allow us to add an elevator for the units

2354
03:35:51,862 --> 03:35:57,726
and add just a little bit of storage space, which would probably be part of the H&R block, become part of the H&R block space.

2355
03:35:59,487 --> 03:36:10,274
This is the existing, generally speaking, location of the existing fire stair, and this would be the second entrance stair leading up.

2356
03:36:10,795 --> 03:36:20,101
And then this is a stair that leads down to the basement, which would be continued to be used as storage for, likely for these two spaces with some mechanical equipment down below.

2357
03:36:21,925 --> 03:36:31,329
The units of above would be three good-sized, fairly luxurious units by a lot of Boston standards.

2358
03:36:32,029 --> 03:36:41,393
We would have, when you come out of the elevator, you would have a three-bedroom unit on one side, and then a two-bedroom unit in this corner.

2359
03:36:41,433 --> 03:36:49,876
And those two units would have the primary exposure on Salem Street, and there would be a one-bedroom tucked in the rear in the addition zone.

2360
03:36:51,847 --> 03:37:01,890
And this addition is very similar to what was on the proposal that was reviewed a year and change ago.

2361
03:37:03,770 --> 03:37:16,714
This particular floor, the second floor, we're gonna take advantage of the high ceilings and try and create small mezzanine spaces above the kitchens so that this zone here feels very much like a double height space.

2362
03:37:17,274 --> 03:37:20,055
And over this, we create a little,

2363
03:37:20,899 --> 03:37:23,200
little bit of an office nook up above the kitchens.

2364
03:37:25,141 --> 03:37:44,250
The third floor would, again, we would still be adding a portion at the rear here, but we'd be removing the black enclosure that you see and kind of giving back the significance of this parapet wall.

2365
03:37:45,550 --> 03:37:47,352
This currently is built up quite a bit.

2366
03:37:47,412 --> 03:37:52,956
We believe we can bring it down nearly to the level of the inside unit once we clean out the structure in there.

2367
03:37:53,096 --> 03:38:05,084
So from this unit, which is a two-bedroom, and this unit, which is a three-bedroom, you would have a short staircase up to a little bit of a deck space that would exist right behind the parapet.

2368
03:38:05,104 --> 03:38:09,848
And the parapet's rather tall, so it would create its own guardrail.

2369
03:38:10,750 --> 03:38:16,752
should serve as its own guardrail without anything kind of adorning the historical parapet wall.

2370
03:38:17,452 --> 03:38:20,253
And then again, one bedroom tucked in the back.

2371
03:38:21,514 --> 03:38:28,276
And the top floor, this floor would be entirely new, the one story that we would be adding to the project.

2372
03:38:28,776 --> 03:38:38,459
Again, a two bedroom on the left, a three bedroom on the right, these two with no outdoor space, and then the one bedroom tucked in the rear.

2373
03:38:40,795 --> 03:38:50,398
Each of these three units would have a small staircase leading up to a roof deck that would be a good distance back.

2374
03:38:50,478 --> 03:38:55,660
I believe this is just over 20 feet back from the facade.

2375
03:38:55,780 --> 03:39:02,382
We're gonna create something that's a little bit taller, but we don't want these to kind of detract from the new elevation.

2376
03:39:03,143 --> 03:39:07,364
This is the building roughly as it stands today, originally known as the Dyer Building.

2377
03:39:10,652 --> 03:39:14,495
and its relationship to its neighbors.

2378
03:39:14,675 --> 03:39:20,940
This is the piece that we would be kind of reopening up to the facade behind.

2379
03:39:21,480 --> 03:39:27,344
And then these are the two storefronts and the area where we would be adding the marquee.

2380
03:39:27,384 --> 03:39:32,348
And you can see kind of what the addition would probably be like.

2381
03:39:32,648 --> 03:39:39,393
We're currently leaning towards something that is not

2382
03:39:40,180 --> 03:40:01,711
as detailed and trying not to be part of the original building and set it back in such a way that it becomes something that is special and thoughtful in its own way, but is not part of the facade that has been part of the street for so very long.

2383
03:40:02,692 --> 03:40:03,032
And then

2384
03:40:04,810 --> 03:40:07,271
That's basically where we are at this point.

2385
03:40:07,311 --> 03:40:12,912
We wanted to kind of open it up for questions and thoughts and see what kind of comments you would have.

2386
03:40:16,553 --> 03:40:23,895
Jeffrey, do you want to deal with the building at this point?

2387
03:40:28,996 --> 03:40:29,777
Yeah, I'm sorry.

2388
03:40:29,797 --> 03:40:30,937
Could you repeat what you just said?

2389
03:40:31,873 --> 03:40:32,173
Sure.

2390
03:40:32,593 --> 03:40:35,654
Jeffrey Dirk, our traffic engineer, is here as well.

2391
03:40:35,694 --> 03:40:39,776
If you want to go through that first and then take questions, it's up to you.

2392
03:40:39,816 --> 03:40:41,517
We can deal with any questions.

2393
03:40:41,537 --> 03:40:42,677
Yeah, let's do that.

2394
03:40:42,937 --> 03:40:44,378
Let's take all the presentations.

2395
03:40:45,098 --> 03:40:45,978
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

2396
03:40:46,019 --> 03:40:47,499
For the record, my name is Jeffrey Dirk.

2397
03:40:47,559 --> 03:40:49,360
I'm a partner with Van Essen Associates.

2398
03:40:49,420 --> 03:40:52,421
And it was mentioned, we're the traffic engineers on the project.

2399
03:40:53,055 --> 03:40:57,039
So we did prepare a transportation impact assessment for the development.

2400
03:40:57,059 --> 03:41:04,307
And I think kind of what you've heard is, from the standpoint of the building itself, it's mixed-use commercial space on the first floor.

2401
03:41:04,748 --> 03:41:09,633
It's really, from the standpoint of the amount of commercial space, it's not changing a lot in terms of the square footage.

2402
03:41:09,693 --> 03:41:12,696
So there's really not a large increase in traffic associated with that.

2403
03:41:13,297 --> 03:41:15,979
And then we're adding nine residential units to the building.

2404
03:41:16,099 --> 03:41:23,986
So the net increase in traffic that we're talking about during the highest traffic volume hour is about 20 peak hour trips.

2405
03:41:24,106 --> 03:41:28,510
So it's one additional vehicle every three minutes during the peak hour.

2406
03:41:28,550 --> 03:41:34,735
And in the context of the volume of traffic on Salem Street, it's not going to be substantially

2407
03:41:35,975 --> 03:41:38,116
not result in a substantial increase in traffic.

2408
03:41:38,917 --> 03:41:45,720
I do want to mention that the site itself, given its location, I mean, it's ideally situated for public transportation access.

2409
03:41:46,420 --> 03:41:58,265
There's a bus stop just within a minute walking distance of the project site at Ashland Street that has nine bus, or sorry, eight buses that stop at that location.

2410
03:41:58,325 --> 03:42:02,527
So it's a great location from the standpoint of not being an auto-centric

2411
03:42:03,787 --> 03:42:09,689
So it fits in very well with the square, especially with the residential units that are there itself.

2412
03:42:09,749 --> 03:42:13,270
So not a large volume of traffic that's expected to be generated.

2413
03:42:13,790 --> 03:42:19,932
We think it'll fit in well with the multimodal context of the square itself.

2414
03:42:20,432 --> 03:42:27,574
There are a series of recommendations that we had in the traffic study and the city engineer has gone through each of those and

2415
03:42:29,082 --> 03:42:34,046
has included those in his comment letter, which is helpful to us, helpful to you as well as you look at it.

2416
03:42:34,066 --> 03:42:39,651
So at the back end of his comment letter, he's reiterated and expanded upon some of our recommendations.

2417
03:42:40,451 --> 03:42:44,735
And Tony has gone through probably those primary ones related to safety.

2418
03:42:44,755 --> 03:42:48,458
So the idea of having these dynamic signs so that as you're

2419
03:42:49,058 --> 03:42:51,920
entering from Salem Street, you'll know if a vehicle is exiting.

2420
03:42:52,561 --> 03:42:54,102
So that sign is going to tell you that.

2421
03:42:54,462 --> 03:43:05,611
And then the same thing if you're in the parking lot looking to exit, there's going to be a sign in the sensor on either end that's going to tell you what's going on, whether a vehicle is approaching or exiting the site.

2422
03:43:05,631 --> 03:43:10,855
So that'll be helpful given the fact that we have a narrow drive aisle there as well.

2423
03:43:11,336 --> 03:43:16,580
The other important thing is, of course, if you're a pedestrian walking across the sidewalk, because these buildings are all

2424
03:43:18,061 --> 03:43:23,124
fronting along Salem Street itself, you want to make sure that pedestrians know when a vehicle is exiting.

2425
03:43:23,584 --> 03:43:26,346
So the signs provide for that as well.

2426
03:43:26,426 --> 03:43:30,109
Again, a dynamic sign that will allow pedestrians to know that.

2427
03:43:30,729 --> 03:43:35,592
Tony had mentioned as well about we had a recommendation along the front of the site itself.

2428
03:43:36,433 --> 03:43:42,577
Given the fact that the drive aisle is somewhere between 10 or 12 feet going into the back parking lot,

2429
03:43:43,157 --> 03:43:47,619
Any loading and delivery activities really needed to take place curbside.

2430
03:43:48,199 --> 03:43:50,140
So that's where you see we have a recommendation.

2431
03:43:50,580 --> 03:43:54,141
And the city engineer has said, of course, we need to get approval from the city.

2432
03:43:54,221 --> 03:44:04,485
But we had recommended a short-term loading zone along the front of the site with specific hours, 6 to 10 in the morning, let's say, so that would accommodate loading and deliveries.

2433
03:44:05,148 --> 03:44:08,472
for the commercial space, but also for the nine residential units.

2434
03:44:08,512 --> 03:44:19,103
We need to have accommodations so that a moving van can get to the front of the building and then allow for people to load or unload their furniture and such from the building itself.

2435
03:44:19,843 --> 03:44:21,785
Other specific recommendations that you'll note

2436
03:44:22,762 --> 03:44:31,666
that the city engineer had mentioned is, there is one parking space that is to, if you're looking at the site itself, it's just to the right of the driveway.

2437
03:44:31,706 --> 03:44:38,029
There's one space along that north side of Salem Street, between the site and Ashland Street.

2438
03:44:38,849 --> 03:44:49,414
That one space, if you're trying to come out of the site, it does, if a vehicle is parked there, it does inhibit your sight lines looking to the left, Salem Street being one way.

2439
03:44:49,854 --> 03:44:52,395
So you do need to look to the left to see if a vehicle is approaching you.

2440
03:44:52,736 --> 03:44:55,197
That vehicle does in fact block your sight line.

2441
03:44:55,917 --> 03:45:07,504
So what you would need to do if a vehicle is there, you would need to pull out first, make sure there's not a pedestrian in the sidewalk, and then proceed out into a portion of Salem Street to be able to look to your left.

2442
03:45:08,284 --> 03:45:11,146
We had suggested possibly removing that parking space.

2443
03:45:11,686 --> 03:45:15,267
and the city engineer had also suggested that that would be a good idea.

2444
03:45:16,127 --> 03:45:34,793
But in the context of looking at the improvements the city has already done at that intersection, which is providing curb line bump outs to shorten the pedestrian crossing distances, what you'll notice if you look at the intersection is because that parking space is there, the bump out is not actually provided for crossing Salem Street.

2445
03:45:34,853 --> 03:45:38,254
It is provided on either side to cross Ashland

2446
03:45:38,534 --> 03:45:40,176
but not for crossing Salem Street.

2447
03:45:40,196 --> 03:45:48,723
So what he suggested is that to remove that parking space is to put a curb line bump out there to shorten that crossing distance along Salem Street.

2448
03:45:49,104 --> 03:45:55,129
And that's consistent with what the city's envisioned for the pedestrian safety improvements in the square itself.

2449
03:45:55,169 --> 03:45:56,270
So we'll be advancing that.

2450
03:45:56,310 --> 03:45:59,193
So he suggested that that be done as a part of this project.

2451
03:45:59,813 --> 03:46:07,463
And along with those improvements, it creates some opportunity for some street furniture enhancements, which he suggested.

2452
03:46:07,523 --> 03:46:13,811
And specifically, a part of our recommendations is to provide a bicycle rack in that area there.

2453
03:46:13,831 --> 03:46:17,155
And so he suggested how that might also function itself.

2454
03:46:17,803 --> 03:46:20,365
So that's kind of a high-level overview of the traffic city.

2455
03:46:20,405 --> 03:46:23,808
Again, from this project's perspective, it's not a large traffic generator.

2456
03:46:24,208 --> 03:46:32,214
So our focus is really on safety of vehicles entering and exiting the site, pedestrian safety, sight lines.

2457
03:46:32,715 --> 03:46:39,039
And then we also have a transportation demand management program to encourage the residents to be able to use the public transportation.

2458
03:46:39,059 --> 03:46:44,223
I don't think it's going to require a lot of encouragement, because you live here, you walk out your front door, and the bus stops right there.

2459
03:46:45,324 --> 03:46:47,365
That in and of itself, it's going to sell itself.

2460
03:46:48,106 --> 03:46:56,831
But we have recommended some things that the property manager can undertake to let people know that the bus stop is there and encourage them to use these public transportation options.

2461
03:46:57,751 --> 03:46:59,652
So that concludes my presentation.

2462
03:46:59,693 --> 03:47:02,414
And I'll be here and happy to answer any questions you might have.

2463
03:47:06,516 --> 03:47:06,697
Great.

2464
03:47:06,957 --> 03:47:07,277
Thank you.

2465
03:47:09,627 --> 03:47:15,810
So at this time, let me open it up to the board members for questions and comments.

2466
03:47:25,996 --> 03:47:27,016
Someone want to kick us off?

2467
03:47:28,717 --> 03:47:29,377
Or I can try.

2468
03:47:29,397 --> 03:47:35,521
I guess my first question is, Andre, where are we in the process here?

2469
03:47:38,240 --> 03:47:40,781
What is the expectation of tonight?

2470
03:47:42,361 --> 03:47:59,427
So my understanding is that the Zoning Board of Appeals needs to grant some variances, and they are planning on opening, I think, their hearing September 3rd.

2471
03:47:59,487 --> 03:48:00,167
Is that right, Annie?

2472
03:48:02,948 --> 03:48:03,628
That's correct.

2473
03:48:04,149 --> 03:48:04,649
That's correct.

2474
03:48:05,839 --> 03:48:16,385
And so basically they look to us for site plan recommendations in terms of design, siting, layout, things like that.

2475
03:48:16,705 --> 03:48:26,150
And so if we do not give them recommendations tonight, they may have to continue their hearing until they get them.

2476
03:48:27,690 --> 03:48:28,911
Annie, do you want to add anything there?

2477
03:48:31,187 --> 03:48:32,208
Sure.

2478
03:48:32,448 --> 03:48:38,533
So the Board of Appeals will be granting the special permit for site plan review as well as variances.

2479
03:48:38,753 --> 03:48:45,498
So they could open the hearing and continue both items if they have not received comments from the CD board.

2480
03:48:51,123 --> 03:48:57,768
So I guess my sort of main

2481
03:48:58,622 --> 03:49:18,046
overarching comment is that I found, especially the engineer in the beginning, I found his presentation very hard to follow for lack of exhibits or small and not easy to read exhibits that were shown.

2482
03:49:19,346 --> 03:49:26,468
The whole thing kind of just, it was just very hard to follow and I really don't even understand

2483
03:49:27,752 --> 03:49:29,013
what is being proposed.

2484
03:49:30,953 --> 03:49:47,881
I think, excuse me, but when we reviewed this project last time, there were a series of exhibits that illustrated exactly what was being proposed in a pretty concise way.

2485
03:49:48,721 --> 03:49:53,323
And the contrast with the presentation tonight is pretty striking.

2486
03:49:54,397 --> 03:49:59,338
So I'm almost at a loss at how to comment.

2487
03:50:00,198 --> 03:50:22,743
I will add that I read through the historic commission's comments and I felt a lot of those were spot on and then I would definitely ask the proponent to take a good hard look at those and consider them, especially as it relates to massing and building design and fenestration of the proposed

2488
03:50:23,186 --> 03:50:24,346
additions to the building.

2489
03:50:26,467 --> 03:50:34,931
But yeah, again, overall, I found the whole thing very hard to comment on because it was just overall pretty hard to understand.

2490
03:50:37,072 --> 03:50:43,634
If I may, with regard to the site plan itself and the structure, we're not demolishing the project at all.

2491
03:50:43,674 --> 03:50:50,457
So the outlay of the site itself is very similar to what exists now, which is what the site plan shows.

2492
03:50:51,442 --> 03:51:02,549
The difference is the additional story to the building itself, and that is depicted in the architect's plans as they exist.

2493
03:51:02,909 --> 03:51:08,513
And with regard to the Historical Commission's comments, we received those yesterday.

2494
03:51:08,533 --> 03:51:10,794
I have gone through them.

2495
03:51:11,054 --> 03:51:18,879
I do believe that they were complementary as to what is remaining on the property, and we had actually

2496
03:51:19,387 --> 03:51:29,572
taken the comments from the previous iteration of this and incorporated much of what the Historical Commission had requested.

2497
03:51:30,193 --> 03:51:38,497
In fact, I think the original Historical Commission comments were five or six pages long, if I'm not mistaken.

2498
03:51:39,377 --> 03:51:48,002
In terms of the comments made by Historical, they're not requesting at this point, if I read them correctly,

2499
03:51:48,460 --> 03:52:01,451
that we maintain or we do anything further in terms of maintaining the historical nature of the building, what they are saying is that these are design changes that they think might be fitting, which would make it more modern.

2500
03:52:02,312 --> 03:52:08,517
The question arises in that regard is that we are keeping the second floor height to the property.

2501
03:52:09,198 --> 03:52:14,122
So in terms of what we can do in terms of lighting and whatnot on those third floor,

2502
03:52:16,102 --> 03:52:27,425
I think that when the architect looked at this, and Eric can speak for himself in this regard, is that he was looking at the windows and providing more interior light to the property.

2503
03:52:28,065 --> 03:52:38,348
With regard to the shadow study, if you've been out to the site, the rear of the property essentially is much lower in elevation.

2504
03:52:38,919 --> 03:52:42,440
than the surrounding Forest Street properties and the Ashland Street properties.

2505
03:52:43,280 --> 03:52:50,523
And the height of this building, as opposed to what was originally proposed, again, a year ago, was six stories.

2506
03:52:51,303 --> 03:52:56,445
The height of this building is 52 feet and four stories, well within

2507
03:52:56,885 --> 03:52:58,366
the zoning requirements.

2508
03:52:58,426 --> 03:53:21,241
I'm not sure the shadow study and the historical committee can speak to this, but I'm not sure really what it's going to show unless they're looking for shadows to the front of the building because the height is going to be commensurate with the remaining buildings and the buildings to the rear on Forest Street and Ashland are at a higher elevation than the existing property.

2509
03:53:22,321 --> 03:53:24,423
So, thank you.

2510
03:53:27,844 --> 03:53:40,711
I sort of agree with all the things you've said, but I think my main comment sort of went over your head, and that is that I still have no idea really what you're proposing.

2511
03:53:41,491 --> 03:53:43,332
I don't really know what the building looks like.

2512
03:53:43,552 --> 03:53:45,793
I don't really know what the back of the building looks like.

2513
03:53:45,993 --> 03:53:48,294
I don't know how you're addressing the sidewalk issues.

2514
03:53:48,754 --> 03:53:55,878
It was all talked about, but without graphics for us to really understand what we're going to get here,

2515
03:53:57,210 --> 03:54:03,111
It's hard to make any kind of an assessment of what you're proposing.

2516
03:54:03,411 --> 03:54:06,112
Well, then again, in fairness, in terms of the sidewalks again.

2517
03:54:06,932 --> 03:54:08,272
I don't want to talk about specifics.

2518
03:54:08,432 --> 03:54:09,152
I'm sorry, ma'am.

2519
03:54:09,633 --> 03:54:13,933
The problem I'm having is that I don't understand the project.

2520
03:54:15,294 --> 03:54:16,054
Plain and simple.

2521
03:54:16,914 --> 03:54:21,795
You have not shown us anything today which gives us a holistic vision of what you're proposing.

2522
03:54:23,742 --> 03:54:25,844
whether things that are in our purview or not.

2523
03:54:25,964 --> 03:54:30,708
We need to have a holistic look at what this project is going to do.

2524
03:54:30,728 --> 03:54:34,831
This is a super important building in the heart of Medford Square.

2525
03:54:34,851 --> 03:54:36,913
And I'm an architect.

2526
03:54:36,993 --> 03:54:37,834
I do this for a living.

2527
03:54:37,854 --> 03:54:42,858
I have no idea what you're even trying to propose.

2528
03:54:43,939 --> 03:54:51,966
So I know the rest of the people that are not in the building profession are having an even harder time dealing with this issue.

2529
03:54:52,724 --> 03:54:55,025
We just went through this on the project we just finished.

2530
03:54:55,125 --> 03:55:01,789
And they finally, after a year and a half, showed us something that really illustrated to us what they were doing.

2531
03:55:01,949 --> 03:55:05,811
And the project got approved the day they did that.

2532
03:55:05,971 --> 03:55:15,355
So I just, I mean, the site plan that was reviewed at the start was a hand-drawn sketch, as far as I'm concerned.

2533
03:55:15,375 --> 03:55:18,337
And it was this big on my screen.

2534
03:55:18,357 --> 03:55:20,498
I have no idea what you're,

2535
03:55:20,835 --> 03:55:30,763
Well, you're kind of the difficulty with that is the zoom as opposed to we've been, we've used site plans all the time and people have succeeded at this.

2536
03:55:31,163 --> 03:55:33,865
Can I just add, hi, this is Christy Dowd.

2537
03:55:33,905 --> 03:55:42,712
So, um, I am in the building profession, but I do agree that the presentation was a little confusing.

2538
03:55:44,103 --> 03:55:57,673
And I don't feel like I could make any recommendations to the zoning board at this time, because I don't quite feel like I have a good understanding of the project.

2539
03:55:57,733 --> 03:56:04,599
And it would be helpful if the proponent could take a step back.

2540
03:56:07,270 --> 03:56:30,657
maybe consider the comments from Clace and whatever may come forward tonight and maybe do a repackage of the presentation and walk us through very comprehensively and in a very better way and sequential order of how the development

2541
03:56:32,624 --> 03:56:39,567
works and more renderings and a better explanation of the variances that are being requested.

2542
03:56:39,587 --> 03:56:41,588
Well, I can go through that.

2543
03:56:41,728 --> 03:56:44,810
I just gave a brief presentation as to the variances, so.

2544
03:56:44,910 --> 03:56:51,333
I think the request is to see all of the information more visually than verbally.

2545
03:56:51,353 --> 03:56:52,754
And holistically.

2546
03:56:53,094 --> 03:57:00,958
And I would really like to see a response to the Historical Commission's comments, because I believe they are very significant.

2547
03:57:01,950 --> 03:57:07,692
And I can just say this right now, there's no way I'm making a recommendation based on what I saw tonight.

2548
03:57:08,252 --> 03:57:09,072
And I back that up.

2549
03:57:09,132 --> 03:57:09,312
Ms.

2550
03:57:09,332 --> 03:57:25,037
Desmond, in all due respect, I want just to give you to highlight and give a visual to yourself for what is being said by my fellow board members is I sat here just as you were going along and I made my own sketch and it's not working for me.

2551
03:57:25,077 --> 03:57:26,417
I'm no architect at all.

2552
03:57:26,968 --> 03:57:30,270
And my planning skills were enough that I was hearing certain things.

2553
03:57:30,310 --> 03:57:37,233
And I realized the only reason why I was able to come into this because urban planning is my background, but I can't even imagine that anyone else.

2554
03:57:37,353 --> 03:57:42,355
And I was following the engineering specs as well for the same thing, but then I realized I'm doing a little bit too much here.

2555
03:57:42,815 --> 03:57:49,078
I prefer this to come from the proponent, especially, and, you know, again, I started to, I started to visualize certain things.

2556
03:57:49,118 --> 03:57:56,201
Like I got excited about the traffic, the backing out of the equipment, because we see that on the Beacon Hill, right across from state, the state house, it works.

2557
03:57:56,675 --> 03:58:03,598
However, again, as Clayce and Christie has said, it's on the proponent to show us this visual.

2558
03:58:04,038 --> 03:58:11,061
And we've seen, as Clayce has also said, this can be done even for the repurposing or the redevelopment of an existing building.

2559
03:58:11,421 --> 03:58:15,743
I would think that would be a little bit more simpler for you to take on.

2560
03:58:16,743 --> 03:58:25,467
And to say, and I want to reiterate, I am not in a position to vote on this or to provide any recommendation to the ZBA.

2561
03:58:26,085 --> 03:58:27,446
based on tonight's presentation.

2562
03:58:28,266 --> 03:58:28,647
Thank you.

2563
03:58:33,350 --> 03:58:34,691
Other board members want to jump in?

2564
03:58:43,116 --> 03:58:43,397
David?

2565
03:58:44,157 --> 03:58:44,377
Sure.

2566
03:58:46,118 --> 03:58:48,979
I will try not to repeat what others have said, though.

2567
03:58:49,019 --> 03:58:52,061
The Historical Commission comments, I think, are super important.

2568
03:58:52,821 --> 03:58:55,982
I wasn't around here for round one.

2569
03:58:56,042 --> 03:59:02,165
I guess you're mentioning that there was another development for this parcel proposed in the past.

2570
03:59:04,366 --> 03:59:09,208
Are you suggesting that the Historical Commission has somehow changed its tune?

2571
03:59:11,526 --> 03:59:13,628
are asking for different things?

2572
03:59:13,708 --> 03:59:13,968
I mean.

2573
03:59:14,588 --> 03:59:17,310
Yeah, I would suggest that that's the case.

2574
03:59:18,150 --> 03:59:25,655
When we had originally reviewed the comments that were provided with the first project, it was six stories.

2575
03:59:26,516 --> 03:59:37,483
So there were things that we kept, such as the interior hallway area and the upper floors, the extended height of those floors, keeping the marquee in.

2576
03:59:39,917 --> 04:00:05,345
comments and and again, you know if if there's something that that that I'm misreading the comments with regard to the historical commission this go-around related to The third story and and and what that should look like and in in quite a bit of it Was was window placement and what types of windows they wanted to have you know, I

2577
04:00:06,653 --> 04:00:21,685
We're preserving the facade and they wanted some changes to the facade that would, I guess, mimics the wrong word, but would kind of preserve what was the original storefront area.

2578
04:00:22,625 --> 04:00:34,395
So there were some comments as to that, but he's taking great pains, my client, to maintain the existing building in its existing condition and try to leave

2579
04:00:35,168 --> 04:00:42,129
much of the interior as it was originally designed.

2580
04:00:42,750 --> 04:00:45,710
And he hasn't touched much of that area.

2581
04:00:45,810 --> 04:00:51,171
Most of the renovations from the exterior will occur on that addition.

2582
04:00:52,832 --> 04:00:54,932
That's my understanding of what was provided.

2583
04:00:55,832 --> 04:00:56,172
So Ms.

2584
04:00:56,212 --> 04:00:58,713
Desmond, I would say the last time

2585
04:01:00,461 --> 04:01:04,363
First of all, the original project was significantly larger.

2586
04:01:04,383 --> 04:01:05,204
It was 20 units.

2587
04:01:05,224 --> 04:01:07,045
There were a couple of affordable units there.

2588
04:01:08,046 --> 04:01:09,346
They came back a couple of times.

2589
04:01:09,387 --> 04:01:13,369
We had extensive discussions about the design and the architecture.

2590
04:01:13,809 --> 04:01:15,250
We really got into the details.

2591
04:01:15,290 --> 04:01:17,311
We talked about the landscaping.

2592
04:01:17,351 --> 04:01:24,556
We talked about the widths of the parking spaces in the back, how they were laid out, the signage and the

2593
04:01:24,997 --> 04:01:32,161
you know, for the entrance and exiting and how to mediate the conflict between pedestrians and cars.

2594
04:01:33,641 --> 04:01:39,964
You know, we talked about the facade, we talked about materials, we talked about bike parking, we talked about a lot of things.

2595
04:01:41,525 --> 04:01:43,546
And none of that is really covered here.

2596
04:01:43,566 --> 04:01:45,307
I think that's what you're hearing from the board members.

2597
04:01:45,387 --> 04:01:49,209
So I think they would like to see more of that.

2598
04:01:49,229 --> 04:01:50,910
There's no like materials with color.

2599
04:01:51,460 --> 04:01:56,605
There's nothing that shows people like sight lines and visuals.

2600
04:01:56,725 --> 04:02:00,949
I think they want to see a little bit more of that so we can have a robust conversation about it.

2601
04:02:01,109 --> 04:02:05,112
Certainly, it's not about the value of the project itself.

2602
04:02:05,233 --> 04:02:06,794
I think everybody cares a lot about this.

2603
04:02:06,834 --> 04:02:10,257
We all want to see residential development in Medford Square.

2604
04:02:10,277 --> 04:02:11,558
We want to see a good project.

2605
04:02:12,900 --> 04:02:15,542
But we can't just take it on faith.

2606
04:02:16,230 --> 04:02:19,932
Well, if I could address some of those issues.

2607
04:02:20,832 --> 04:02:36,479
First, with respect to the parking, and I do know from the prior parking iteration that there was a request to have the adequate width and length of the parking spaces.

2608
04:02:37,020 --> 04:02:41,842
And the project as proposed maintains the current

2609
04:02:42,463 --> 04:02:43,424
spaces and width.

2610
04:02:43,584 --> 04:02:50,111
And I believe we had a photograph that showed adequately that those vehicles could park within those spaces.

2611
04:02:50,491 --> 04:03:04,825
The difficulty is that if you attempt to hold the width and the length of those spaces, you then create another zoning issue with regard to the aisle width.

2612
04:03:06,551 --> 04:03:22,615
if you were to create those spaces, and part of the difficulty is that you've got that retaining wall to the left side of the property, and then you've got a retaining wall on the other side of the property, because this property essentially sits at a lower elevation than the surrounding properties behind.

2613
04:03:23,475 --> 04:03:34,318
So if you were to take the spaces and make them uniform as to width and length, and currently the zoning ordinance requires it to be nine by 19,

2614
04:03:36,817 --> 04:03:38,598
19 feet in length and nine feet in width.

2615
04:03:39,298 --> 04:03:45,360
You would not have sufficient space in the lane to have your aisle width.

2616
04:03:46,101 --> 04:03:49,002
And so that would create another variance request.

2617
04:03:49,782 --> 04:04:04,128
And in speaking with the building inspector when we went through this, the importance of having adequate lane width as opposed to parking space width, for safety purposes, it's more of a,

2618
04:04:05,974 --> 04:04:06,494
a benefit.

2619
04:04:07,094 --> 04:04:10,715
And in looking, and I did some research in terms of what the average car length is.

2620
04:04:11,276 --> 04:04:17,958
So if you're looking at an average car length, if you have, for instance, an Escalade.

2621
04:04:18,658 --> 04:04:26,100
An Escalade is 16.7 feet in length, and it is roughly 6.75 feet in width.

2622
04:04:27,041 --> 04:04:31,522
And those spaces, as they are laid out at this point, would adequately accommodate them.

2623
04:04:32,186 --> 04:04:33,888
It's also a preexisting condition.

2624
04:04:34,989 --> 04:04:42,034
If you take commercial space, if this was three, four floors of commercial space, you would need 33 spaces.

2625
04:04:42,815 --> 04:04:47,939
This reduces the overall requirement of spaces to 29 spaces.

2626
04:04:47,959 --> 04:04:49,461
There's a net loss of one.

2627
04:04:51,142 --> 04:04:57,968
The argument to the ZBA in that regard would be you've got a lot that is non-conforming as it exists now.

2628
04:04:58,868 --> 04:04:59,689
It now has 23 spaces.

2629
04:05:00,927 --> 04:05:03,329
It's going to be reduced by five, so you'll have 18.

2630
04:05:04,350 --> 04:05:10,757
But at that point, you'll have spaces which adequately fit vehicles, and you'd maintain the aisle width.

2631
04:05:10,857 --> 04:05:15,682
And I think Jeff could speak to the aisle width too, because we- Excuse me, Ms.

2632
04:05:15,702 --> 04:05:16,022
Desmond.

2633
04:05:16,042 --> 04:05:17,904
I'm sorry, but are you suggesting that-

2634
04:05:19,057 --> 04:05:28,003
you can't or don't want to provide more visual materials that we're requesting or that we shouldn't discuss some of the items that we've raised?

2635
04:05:28,363 --> 04:05:30,885
No, I'm not saying that at all.

2636
04:05:31,285 --> 04:05:38,951
But in terms of you raised that issue, and our plan shows 18 spaces.

2637
04:05:39,031 --> 04:05:42,733
So I mean, we have considered those issues.

2638
04:05:43,454 --> 04:05:48,037
And with regard to that parking plan, to reduce it to make the spaces uniform,

2639
04:05:48,998 --> 04:05:50,939
would create turn issues.

2640
04:05:51,779 --> 04:05:57,320
Well, I just think that the folks want to be able to have that conversation, but they want to know what they're talking about.

2641
04:05:57,340 --> 04:05:59,921
I mean, they need to be able to see it.

2642
04:05:59,941 --> 04:06:09,164
I mean, where I'm struggling is I'd like to graphically understand what the problems are, and then take the board members through how

2643
04:06:10,627 --> 04:06:24,258
you're responding to those challenges and presenting the best project possible, considering the conditions of the site and all the parameters that you need to work within.

2644
04:06:24,278 --> 04:06:26,860
I think, Christy, you're absolutely right.

2645
04:06:26,880 --> 04:06:28,241
Sorry, Dana.

2646
04:06:28,541 --> 04:06:33,165
No, I'm just going to say that only a few of us were here last time, and these are all issues that we did discuss.

2647
04:06:33,185 --> 04:06:36,107
But since this is a new project, I think that all of you.

2648
04:06:37,388 --> 04:06:39,810
I was just going to say that the,

2649
04:06:41,832 --> 04:06:53,477
we need to, you know, this board just to the point that we need to be able to see this visually, I think we have the ability to make a recommendation based on all those things that you're talking about.

2650
04:06:53,617 --> 04:07:02,381
And I think you said them nicely, but without a graphic, and without the whole picture, it's very hard to understand really what you're talking about.

2651
04:07:02,421 --> 04:07:04,882
I think people that are in the building industry might be able to do it.

2652
04:07:05,598 --> 04:07:11,319
and I was sort of grabbing what you were saying, but without that visual, we can't do it.

2653
04:07:11,379 --> 04:07:22,941
We have the ability to make a recommendation, say, yes, they've done a really good job, and yeah, the parking spots should be smaller, and the drive while should be bigger, and we got a recommendation from the fire chief, and all this stuff.

2654
04:07:23,681 --> 04:07:28,602
But without those visuals to back them up, I mean, we're just, all we're doing right now is just hearing you.

2655
04:07:29,162 --> 04:07:32,543
We do have that visual here if you would like to look at it.

2656
04:07:34,408 --> 04:07:37,450
The visual, you had a chance to show me the visual and it didn't work.

2657
04:07:38,291 --> 04:07:39,452
I don't wanna look at the visual again.

2658
04:07:41,234 --> 04:07:45,077
Let's just be, so I think what you're hearing Ms.

2659
04:07:45,097 --> 04:07:49,080
Desmond, this project is gonna be continued to next month.

2660
04:07:49,520 --> 04:08:01,470
And I think what we should do now is board members should indicate to you and your team what would be helpful for them to see so that next time we can have a really productive

2661
04:08:02,063 --> 04:08:06,906
conversation and hopefully move forward with a set of recommendations.

2662
04:08:08,848 --> 04:08:16,253
So let me ask the board members, are there specific things that you'd like to see for next month?

2663
04:08:18,095 --> 04:08:22,197
I think definitely the landscaped area in the back and the retaining walls.

2664
04:08:25,340 --> 04:08:29,283
I mean, Andre, sorry, Deanne, I just finished, sorry.

2665
04:08:33,608 --> 04:08:45,415
To Christy's earlier point, I don't think it's our responsibility to be fishing for the information we need to make these recommendations.

2666
04:08:46,095 --> 04:08:57,282
The proponent needs to come to us with a comprehensive and holistic package that illustrates all the issues that we need to consider to make a recommendation for this project.

2667
04:08:58,102 --> 04:08:59,663
We can make a whole list tonight.

2668
04:09:00,848 --> 04:09:26,257
But if this package comes back and there's like one thing missing or if there's you know It's it to me It's on the proponent to put together materials that help us understand this project properly And that's what we did for um winter street, and and that's why it went well tonight and I mean this this

2669
04:09:27,276 --> 04:09:31,858
It is not our job to beg for information so that we can understand their project.

2670
04:09:35,379 --> 04:09:54,305
The only thing that I would add, if for projects that the board easily understood, I don't know if there's some guidance that the Community Development Board could give and say, here's images that exist online for guidance.

2671
04:09:58,631 --> 04:10:18,126
I do think it's on an individual basis, but the first thing I would say is that the proponent should have a look at some of the projects that have been successfully recommended by this board and by the ZBA, and look through them and see the exhibits that they used.

2672
04:10:18,646 --> 04:10:23,830
We've seen plenty of projects where we looked at them, they gave a presentation, we looked at them, we said, yep, that looks good.

2673
04:10:24,791 --> 04:10:26,833
Because everything we needed to know was right there.

2674
04:10:27,470 --> 04:10:29,492
So there, you know, and that's all public record.

2675
04:10:29,853 --> 04:10:44,948
Well, and I think on this very project to you have an instance of, you know, a board discussion, what we were looking for the recommendations, the level of product that we we needed to make decisions.

2676
04:10:45,549 --> 04:10:48,412
And I think even looking at that would be would be helpful.

2677
04:10:51,508 --> 04:11:01,571
You know, and I know what you're saying that you're, I think you're saying that from your perspective, you're probably seeing this as a, a simpler project than the one that was already recommended.

2678
04:11:01,631 --> 04:11:05,132
So why isn't it sailing through, but it is a different project.

2679
04:11:05,453 --> 04:11:12,675
And I think that, you know, the design is very different and we, we just need to have that conversation again.

2680
04:11:15,058 --> 04:11:16,399
Who is the design consultant?

2681
04:11:16,419 --> 04:11:24,863
Can the proponent sort of refer back to the design engineer and consultant and have that conversation and have them holistically bring it to life for us?

2682
04:11:25,843 --> 04:11:28,124
Well, I mean, their design team is here.

2683
04:11:28,184 --> 04:11:29,305
I think it's just a different team.

2684
04:11:29,985 --> 04:11:43,792
I mean, the site plan requirements and what, and I'm not saying this to be argumentative in any fashion, but what the site plan requirements are and what you're looking for in terms of 3D and shade studies, that's not,

2685
04:11:45,103 --> 04:11:46,364
that isn't a requirement.

2686
04:11:47,525 --> 04:11:52,568
And so if that's what the board is looking for from this point forward, then it's noted.

2687
04:11:53,589 --> 04:11:59,553
But that is not something that has been required throughout in terms of site plan review.

2688
04:11:59,633 --> 04:12:04,536
Because site plan review and design review, ultimately, I mean, this isn't approved at this point.

2689
04:12:04,676 --> 04:12:08,059
So we're not even at that final stage.

2690
04:12:08,479 --> 04:12:11,961
And in terms of when we receive comments, and again, I'm only saying this from,

2691
04:12:13,585 --> 04:12:27,728
you know, from the perspective of in terms of time, I mean, you know, if we had a chance after seeing the comments to, to, to replan it, then, then at that point we would, but you're talking, you know, two to three days before you receive comments.

2692
04:12:27,928 --> 04:12:40,350
So if that's, if that's something that's different than again, noted, you know, I'm not, I'm not seeking to argue with the board or to, you know, indicate that we won't do this because certainly we won't.

2693
04:12:41,178 --> 04:12:50,164
But in terms of what we have done in the comments, and in particular historical, we took a hard look at what was required.

2694
04:12:50,184 --> 04:13:00,491
And I think that much of what they had issues with originally in the first project that was provided, they tried to preserve.

2695
04:13:00,872 --> 04:13:07,436
And I think if you compare the notes, that I think we have done that.

2696
04:13:11,208 --> 04:13:14,651
I understand that they want some different lighting in the project.

2697
04:13:15,731 --> 04:13:18,694
You know, the outside as opposed to what the inside is.

2698
04:13:19,734 --> 04:13:24,858
You know, there's interior space versus exterior space, and in terms of what they want the windows to look like.

2699
04:13:25,399 --> 04:13:32,724
You know, all of that, you know, we got those comments the other day, and we're not adverse to incorporating that into the discussion.

2700
04:13:32,824 --> 04:13:36,247
But, you know, our plans are submitted at that point with a design.

2701
04:13:37,047 --> 04:13:40,630
Now, if you don't like the design, then that's a whole different conversation.

2702
04:13:41,591 --> 04:13:53,708
than the fact that there was a design where we tried to incorporate those items that were an issue on the original project and to preserve as much of the existing building.

2703
04:13:54,385 --> 04:13:58,688
Can I ask, I'm sorry, could I just interrupt for a second and ask?

2704
04:13:58,828 --> 04:14:08,075
This is where I am getting a little more confused in terms of references to the prior project, because do we have to consider the prior project anymore?

2705
04:14:08,295 --> 04:14:10,897
That's in the past, and what we're talking about is a project.

2706
04:14:10,917 --> 04:14:13,278
This is a totally new project, totally new submission.

2707
04:14:13,458 --> 04:14:16,100
So a historical commission's letter is

2708
04:14:19,118 --> 04:14:22,341
Present letter is focused on the current project.

2709
04:14:22,401 --> 04:14:31,668
So I think that's the subject of our discussion, which is not reference to anything that happened for the prior project.

2710
04:14:31,688 --> 04:14:34,050
So I think what we're seeing are the comments

2711
04:14:35,226 --> 04:14:46,256
that we feel are important based on the current project and would like to see a response to those visually.

2712
04:14:46,816 --> 04:14:55,884
And I guess what I'm saying, in fairness to that, is that the time frame from when you receive the comments to when the hearing is, it's a matter of days.

2713
04:14:56,365 --> 04:15:02,070
So to give any kind of reflection or consideration and to change a plan within that period of time

2714
04:15:03,722 --> 04:15:04,623
is difficult.

2715
04:15:04,683 --> 04:15:11,265
So I don't have an issue necessarily with the fact that you want to continue the hearing on that.

2716
04:15:11,625 --> 04:15:27,811
And if you want additional information as to each variance requested with the argument, although I do think that you received that information as part of your original package, because your original package included the zoning evaluation, my zoning worksheet, the zoning application.

2717
04:15:28,312 --> 04:15:36,056
So I think all that information has been provided in addition to the written statement as to what the argument software experience requested.

2718
04:15:37,077 --> 04:15:46,481
And with regard to the parking, I frankly jumped on that because I know what the situation was with the prior parking iteration.

2719
04:15:47,622 --> 04:15:56,627
And I think that in terms of the parking plan, we're losing five spaces by virtue of the extension of the building, a small addition.

2720
04:15:58,355 --> 04:16:13,519
But to try and reconfigure those spaces so that they're even and they meet the requirements of the zoning ordinance of nine feet and 19 feet, you're gonna reduce the outwith, which is a concern for the board.

2721
04:16:14,439 --> 04:16:16,479
And also the number of spaces is a concern.

2722
04:16:16,859 --> 04:16:17,299
So Ms.

2723
04:16:17,319 --> 04:16:24,281
Desmond, since we're gonna be continuing this, do you have questions for us that might be helpful for you in terms of

2724
04:16:24,848 --> 04:16:36,754
I would like to hear from historicalists to what else they're searching for on this in terms of what they're looking for and what they want in terms of a design so that it can be considered.

2725
04:16:36,774 --> 04:16:41,036
Because I don't want to come back and then, you know, that isn't really what they're looking for.

2726
04:16:41,857 --> 04:16:45,579
So I would certainly take some input from historicalists to what it is.

2727
04:16:46,317 --> 04:16:46,457
Right.

2728
04:16:46,517 --> 04:16:51,061
Well, we're obviously not the historical commission, but we do have someone here who might be able to speak to that.

2729
04:16:51,081 --> 04:16:52,222
So I will let them speak.

2730
04:16:53,002 --> 04:16:55,765
And then I would like to wrap this up pretty quickly.

2731
04:16:55,825 --> 04:17:00,388
So can someone, Annie, can you unmute Doug Carr?

2732
04:17:02,050 --> 04:17:02,390
Peter.

2733
04:17:02,750 --> 04:17:03,391
Peter.

2734
04:17:03,551 --> 04:17:03,991
OK.

2735
04:17:04,011 --> 04:17:04,652
Thank you, Peter.

2736
04:17:05,933 --> 04:17:07,794
Yeah, I was the one who, can you hear me?

2737
04:17:08,535 --> 04:17:09,095
Yes, we can.

2738
04:17:09,115 --> 04:17:09,276
OK.

2739
04:17:09,836 --> 04:17:13,759
I was the one who actually wrote the letter with Doug's input.

2740
04:17:15,593 --> 04:17:31,585
So just really quickly, I mean, I don't want to talk about the other project, but we were more, I left out some of the comments from the other project because I felt maybe this was a little bit closer to the mark.

2741
04:17:31,626 --> 04:17:37,070
We really appreciated the fact that they want to rebuild the marquee.

2742
04:17:38,231 --> 04:17:40,593
We appreciated the fact that, you know,

2743
04:17:41,382 --> 04:17:46,306
they're going to kind of restore that, the historic building there.

2744
04:17:46,886 --> 04:17:54,832
But I guess our, we have some issues with the way the addition is designed and we feel like the,

2745
04:17:57,945 --> 04:18:00,947
What the third story that's there now is really ugly.

2746
04:18:01,107 --> 04:18:04,929
And we feel like we're not actually doing that much better with this design.

2747
04:18:05,570 --> 04:18:09,672
So we feel like there should be some more care with the design.

2748
04:18:11,553 --> 04:18:15,796
For instance, there's a lack of specificity just as in the site plans.

2749
04:18:15,816 --> 04:18:25,001
Like the materials aren't called out on the facade design of the new second or third and fourth floor.

2750
04:18:25,041 --> 04:18:27,243
So we don't know what it's made out of.

2751
04:18:29,868 --> 04:18:34,909
And we feel like the proportions of the windows are very strange.

2752
04:18:35,109 --> 04:18:43,792
We have these huge windows on the fourth floor and these tiny mouse hole windows on the third floor, and they don't seem to relate to each other.

2753
04:18:43,872 --> 04:18:50,054
So we're not asking that the building be more historical, the addition be more historical.

2754
04:18:50,134 --> 04:18:55,256
We're not asking that the building be more modern, although we feel like it could be.

2755
04:18:56,837 --> 04:18:57,457
We just feel like,

2756
04:18:58,450 --> 04:19:02,874
The facade design needs a lot of work and it's very bland.

2757
04:19:05,055 --> 04:19:16,004
It looks like, I don't know, anyway, I can't really comment on, I don't wanna say bad things, but I just feel like, you know,

2758
04:19:17,411 --> 04:19:19,392
The facade design is really weak.

2759
04:19:19,812 --> 04:19:21,773
We would like to see what the materials are.

2760
04:19:22,273 --> 04:19:24,393
We'd like to see it more articulated.

2761
04:19:24,413 --> 04:19:30,515
We would like the materials to be a quality material up there, because this is a really important building in Medford.

2762
04:19:31,256 --> 04:19:33,756
And we'd like to see quality materials.

2763
04:19:33,776 --> 04:19:34,737
We just don't want to see like,

2764
04:19:35,537 --> 04:19:37,939
you know, stucco up there with control joints in it.

2765
04:19:38,259 --> 04:19:47,266
We don't like, we don't wanna see this really cheap looking facade slapped down on top of one of our most historical important buildings in Medford.

2766
04:19:47,987 --> 04:19:49,008
That's our main beef.

2767
04:19:50,028 --> 04:19:54,532
I mean, the building is gonna be taller than the existing one.

2768
04:19:55,032 --> 04:20:03,579
That's why we like to see a shadow study on basically any project, you know, just to see what impact will that shadow study have on the street.

2769
04:20:04,529 --> 04:20:09,354
We'd like to see maybe the storefront windows have a little bit more detail to them.

2770
04:20:09,875 --> 04:20:11,777
Again, we're not saying they have to be historical.

2771
04:20:12,618 --> 04:20:21,427
We just feel like right now we have this mass expanse of these two storefronts of butt-glazed glass, which could be very elegant, but

2772
04:20:22,831 --> 04:20:32,759
It also could be, I think if you look at the original facade, there's a lot of deep level of detail on the storefronts that have been eliminated.

2773
04:20:32,999 --> 04:20:38,163
And it looks kind of, I don't know, out of place to me.

2774
04:20:38,963 --> 04:20:39,244
It's like,

2775
04:20:41,410 --> 04:20:44,531
a UFO landed down there on the first floor.

2776
04:20:44,611 --> 04:20:46,812
So I guess those are some of our issues.

2777
04:20:48,172 --> 04:20:50,773
We really do appreciate some of the moves though.

2778
04:20:51,213 --> 04:20:53,794
We really appreciate putting the marquee back.

2779
04:20:54,174 --> 04:20:59,936
We appreciate the fact that you're keeping that high base second floor space on the street facade.

2780
04:21:00,216 --> 04:21:01,636
Those are great moves.

2781
04:21:03,117 --> 04:21:06,058
And so I guess I could leave it at that.

2782
04:21:07,738 --> 04:21:09,339
Those are really the heart of our,

2783
04:21:10,601 --> 04:21:10,981
comments.

2784
04:21:11,021 --> 04:21:12,763
I don't know, Doug, if you want to add anything to that.

2785
04:21:16,265 --> 04:21:16,906
Unmute Doug.

2786
04:21:16,926 --> 04:21:25,272
I'll be very brief.

2787
04:21:25,312 --> 04:21:28,275
I think Peter hit on most of the comments.

2788
04:21:28,575 --> 04:21:29,676
I think there's a great project.

2789
04:21:29,976 --> 04:21:33,038
I'm in support of this development.

2790
04:21:33,739 --> 04:21:37,082
I want to see this building restored but also added on to.

2791
04:21:37,142 --> 04:21:40,164
I think it's a project that we can all get behind

2792
04:21:40,993 --> 04:21:42,413
It's just going to take more than one meeting.

2793
04:21:42,553 --> 04:21:46,355
I mean, it's not, I know the comments came up a little late.

2794
04:21:46,395 --> 04:21:47,935
I wish that's our fault.

2795
04:21:47,955 --> 04:21:54,477
We should have gotten to him earlier, but honestly, some ability of this, of this importance will never be just one meeting.

2796
04:21:54,497 --> 04:22:00,139
That's just not realistic for the importance of this.

2797
04:22:00,199 --> 04:22:07,141
And I just want to echo again, I think the facade, the front facade, there needs to be an idea there that's clear.

2798
04:22:07,928 --> 04:22:08,668
and understandable.

2799
04:22:08,688 --> 04:22:12,269
I just don't think it's there right now, but I think it won't be hard to get there.

2800
04:22:12,349 --> 04:22:19,892
We just need to look at some colors and materials, some administration options, bring them back, you know, run them by the historic commission.

2801
04:22:19,932 --> 04:22:28,915
We'll look at it, you know, as soon as it's available and give our comments to the development board, who I think have been greatly improved the last couple of years.

2802
04:22:29,615 --> 04:22:32,516
They're some really thoughtful people and thoughtfully done.

2803
04:22:32,956 --> 04:22:34,457
So I think, again, I'm

2804
04:22:35,623 --> 04:22:39,404
I want this building and this project to succeed, and we're going to help you get there.

2805
04:22:39,424 --> 04:22:40,144
It won't be long.

2806
04:22:40,645 --> 04:22:42,285
We're not going to drag this out.

2807
04:22:42,745 --> 04:22:52,388
Let's just come back and have a more interactive dialogue and a little better on the presentation, especially on the civil and the engineering side, and I think we'll be good to go.

2808
04:22:52,428 --> 04:23:01,411
I think the architectural presentation with the color and the graphics was actually pretty good, although the new rendering, again, you couldn't tell the materials, the color.

2809
04:23:01,931 --> 04:23:03,852
There was a few pieces missing there, but I think

2810
04:23:04,513 --> 04:23:07,314
This is not going to be a difficult thing to get through.

2811
04:23:08,395 --> 04:23:10,356
It's going to be a good project.

2812
04:23:12,677 --> 04:23:13,997
Can I just make one last comment?

2813
04:23:14,677 --> 04:23:16,258
Sure, go ahead, Klaus.

2814
04:23:16,858 --> 04:23:25,462
So basically, you know, from Doug and Peter, we got the exact same comment that I made earlier, and that's that we're missing information.

2815
04:23:25,582 --> 04:23:29,083
We're missing the whole story here.

2816
04:23:29,103 --> 04:23:32,485
And I think that's what we're asking for, is we're asking for you to provide

2817
04:23:34,470 --> 04:24:01,874
the whole story to us and to the point about you know that this is just site plan review this board is yes we are directed with site plan review and in this case recommendation to the ZBA but to properly understand a project you can't this isn't a parking lot this is a building in a historic and important building we need to understand the three-dimensional aspects of the building the design of the building and everything when considering

2818
04:24:02,422 --> 04:24:05,264
the site plan implications of the whole project.

2819
04:24:05,464 --> 04:24:06,325
That's why we're here.

2820
04:24:06,365 --> 04:24:11,929
We're not just, you know, you can just get an engineer to click the boxes, but that's not why we're here.

2821
04:24:12,010 --> 04:24:20,696
We're here to consider this project holistically, you know, specifically for site plan review, but also in this case for recommendation to the board.

2822
04:24:21,037 --> 04:24:23,218
So, yeah, we need to see the design.

2823
04:24:23,258 --> 04:24:27,842
We need to see the whole story, just like the historic commission does and just like the ZBA will.

2824
04:24:28,672 --> 04:24:43,517
Okay, it's getting late, so I want to just invite the city's engineer office if they want to make any points that they want to let the proponents know about so that they can address those as well when they come back.

2825
04:24:46,878 --> 04:24:53,040
Not specifically, so the review you may have noticed is very similar to the last one.

2826
04:24:53,060 --> 04:24:55,701
A lot of the recommendations are the same, scaled down a little bit.

2827
04:24:57,690 --> 04:25:11,439
And I'm willing to talk about Tony's point about the valving and a reasonable setup for that, because one of the things that he did not notice is it's a 14-inch water main out there.

2828
04:25:11,499 --> 04:25:16,323
So we could talk about that, Tony, and maybe sit down with the water department.

2829
04:25:17,243 --> 04:25:18,284
But besides that, I think

2830
04:25:19,707 --> 04:25:23,172
And it looks like Todd's still here, so you can chime in too.

2831
04:25:23,452 --> 04:25:30,943
But a lot of the recommendations were very reasonable when it comes to the operation of the traffic around the area.

2832
04:25:32,094 --> 04:25:40,459
Also, the discussion of the parking spaces and the smaller spots, that would be the preference from our perspective to the smaller spots and more maneuverability.

2833
04:25:40,880 --> 04:25:41,580
We noticed that too.

2834
04:25:41,820 --> 04:25:43,001
The configuration is the same.

2835
04:25:43,061 --> 04:25:47,724
So from a site perspective, it's pretty simple of a project.

2836
04:25:47,985 --> 04:25:51,207
Of course, I think everybody touched upon the main point of this project is the building.

2837
04:25:52,227 --> 04:26:02,932
And some of the modest requests that we're seeking only seek to improve sort of the direction that the city's already going in this corridor and helping out that effort.

2838
04:26:03,292 --> 04:26:10,475
But generally, the recommendations made by Van Ness are appropriate.

2839
04:26:11,035 --> 04:26:17,278
And we reviewed those recommendations and the engineering recommendations as well, and there's nothing in there that is an issue.

2840
04:26:17,298 --> 04:26:21,340
We've also reviewed the health department recommendations

2841
04:26:22,071 --> 04:26:32,334
And I think that they requested that rather than public trash pickup, that we engage a private vendor, which is fine.

2842
04:26:33,075 --> 04:26:33,635
We'll do that.

2843
04:26:33,675 --> 04:26:37,156
We're going to try to, we're going to avoid an outside dumpster.

2844
04:26:37,536 --> 04:26:49,800
I think we can have a private vendor take those trash cans materials and take them off site, storing them in the trash collection room that's in the building, along with the bike racks.

2845
04:26:51,597 --> 04:26:51,737
Okay.

2846
04:26:52,797 --> 04:26:54,758
I think I would just add briefly, if I may.

2847
04:26:55,018 --> 04:26:55,598
Oh, sorry.

2848
04:26:55,638 --> 04:26:56,319
Go ahead, Todd.

2849
04:26:57,799 --> 04:27:13,425
Yeah, I think Tim here on the head of the recommendations does outline that some of the things that are subject to traffic commission approval, I would just echo briefly that, yeah, there could be a little better detail graphically for the traffic pieces of it.

2850
04:27:13,525 --> 04:27:16,986
And the traffic memo, it explains it very well in text, but then it

2851
04:27:17,970 --> 04:27:25,252
the graphics of the signs almost look static, not LED flashing with audible tone, it's hard to tell.

2852
04:27:25,852 --> 04:27:43,756
In terms of the parking layout, it would be helpful if dimensions were called out for individual spaces and widths, just because then it would help the board and us determine if 24 feet with a 17 foot space, that's one thing, but if it's 24 feet,

2853
04:27:44,720 --> 04:27:46,242
adjacent to a 14 ft space.

2854
04:27:46,562 --> 04:27:48,265
The 14 ft space is kind of unusable.

2855
04:27:48,305 --> 04:27:49,927
It's going to stick into the aisle anyways.

2856
04:27:50,628 --> 04:27:51,088
So it does.

2857
04:27:51,308 --> 04:27:55,253
It does help to have a little more detail in the parking spaces.

2858
04:27:57,496 --> 04:28:03,304
Yeah, and landscaping, as has been mentioned, um, you know, just understanding the snow removal and

2859
04:28:05,017 --> 04:28:08,058
all of the bike, you know, the bike situation wasn't fully explained.

2860
04:28:08,098 --> 04:28:10,059
So just those kinds of things we wanna go into.

2861
04:28:10,159 --> 04:28:21,762
Well, in terms of the bike situation, I guess- No, I don't wanna go into it right now, it's very late, let's just- One question for the engineer though, in terms of where he wants those situated, because we have an indoor bike access area.

2862
04:28:22,122 --> 04:28:25,343
But then we're gonna discuss, the board will have an opinion about where that should be located.

2863
04:28:25,423 --> 04:28:28,044
So I think I wanna have a full conversation about that.

2864
04:28:28,524 --> 04:28:32,666
Okay, because we didn't put it in because we don't know where the city wants them at this point.

2865
04:28:33,106 --> 04:28:33,606
Take a stab.

2866
04:28:34,782 --> 04:28:35,843
Take a stab, okay.

2867
04:28:37,885 --> 04:28:47,014
I mean, in projects that we've done recently, there's been, you know, we prefer sheltered, lockable, you know, bike.

2868
04:28:47,715 --> 04:28:49,076
Interior, which we have.

2869
04:28:49,577 --> 04:28:49,717
Yeah.

2870
04:28:51,758 --> 04:28:54,880
I thought you just said you didn't know where it was going to go.

2871
04:28:54,920 --> 04:29:02,285
But the city engineer also wanted exterior bike racks, which we didn't put in on the plan because we don't know where the city wants us to go.

2872
04:29:02,325 --> 04:29:05,508
And I think typically, that's an after approval situation.

2873
04:29:05,528 --> 04:29:06,588
We'll agree to the condition.

2874
04:29:07,169 --> 04:29:13,974
But if you want them on the outside, then some direction as to where you want them, we can put them in on the plan in advance of the next meeting.

2875
04:29:14,414 --> 04:29:15,215
Yeah.

2876
04:29:16,035 --> 04:29:16,736
I agree with Sim.

2877
04:29:16,816 --> 04:29:17,316
Take a stab.

2878
04:29:17,656 --> 04:29:19,658
There's guidance out there.

2879
04:29:19,718 --> 04:29:20,698
There's guidance.

2880
04:29:23,725 --> 04:29:28,547
All right, Lorena did receive a brief email comment from the member of the public.

2881
04:29:28,588 --> 04:29:30,008
So I'd ask her to just read that right now.

2882
04:29:30,468 --> 04:29:33,230
Yes, from Keith Barry of Forest Street.

2883
04:29:34,532 --> 04:29:40,479
I am writing in support of the project at 30-36 Salem Street as it would provide more housing in Medford.

2884
04:29:41,039 --> 04:29:54,515
I have been lucky enough to own a home in Medford Square for nearly a decade, and I am glad to see that new development opportunities are making it possible for more people to live in a vibrant community close to job opportunities and community resources.

2885
04:29:55,400 --> 04:30:04,964
I had no prior knowledge of the project until receiving a meeting notice, and I have no special knowledge of the project aside from the documents posted on the Community Development Board website.

2886
04:30:05,344 --> 04:30:15,529
However, I must voice my support of any project that will add more housing units to Medford, especially walkable and transit-rich areas such as Medford Square.

2887
04:30:16,309 --> 04:30:18,370
I urge your approval of this project.

2888
04:30:20,031 --> 04:30:20,211
Great.

2889
04:30:20,351 --> 04:30:22,472
Thank you, Lorena, for reading that.

2890
04:30:23,392 --> 04:30:25,193
Is there a motion on the floor to continue

2891
04:30:29,035 --> 04:30:30,396
I'll make a motion to continue.

2892
04:30:31,356 --> 04:30:31,957
Thank you, class.

2893
04:30:31,977 --> 04:30:32,937
Is there a second?

2894
04:30:33,438 --> 04:30:34,278
I'll second it.

2895
04:30:34,518 --> 04:30:35,179
Thanks, Christy.

2896
04:30:35,199 --> 04:30:37,260
All right, roll call vote.

2897
04:30:37,360 --> 04:30:37,980
Deanna Peabody?

2898
04:30:39,041 --> 04:30:40,922
We need to continue to adjourn certain.

2899
04:30:40,982 --> 04:30:42,723
Yeah, but it's September 16th.

2900
04:30:44,624 --> 04:30:53,830
Do you want to have this the same night as the BJ's, and there's probably going to be the discussion of the brewery ordinance from the city council?

2901
04:30:54,330 --> 04:30:56,852
Or do you want to split it to another night so that

2902
04:30:57,933 --> 04:31:03,517
the meetings are not quite so long.

2903
04:31:04,417 --> 04:31:12,802
Well, my feeling is that the BJ's discussion should not be very long since we've discussed it several times already.

2904
04:31:16,565 --> 04:31:18,566
But what are the other board members, do you have an opinion?

2905
04:31:19,953 --> 04:31:21,013
We went 8-0.

2906
04:31:21,233 --> 04:31:23,594
If we were to split it, that means it's two meetings.

2907
04:31:24,854 --> 04:31:31,095
Is it just a matter of time or we still have to, it's going to be two meetings or a long meeting.

2908
04:31:31,455 --> 04:31:33,275
So I have no preference either way.

2909
04:31:37,096 --> 04:31:38,836
Cles, it looked like you had a preference.

2910
04:31:38,956 --> 04:31:41,117
Did you, were you saying two meetings, separate meeting?

2911
04:31:43,217 --> 04:31:49,078
I mean, in a way I sort of feel like this merits a longer discussion, obviously not one for right now, but, um,

2912
04:31:50,268 --> 04:32:11,936
I, I think there needs to be talk about how we, um, we schedule these meetings more, you know, um, my feeling is that, you know, after nine 30, we're not making good decisions any longer and it's affecting our work.

2913
04:32:12,196 --> 04:32:18,458
So I, again, I think it merits a longer discussion, which we can

2914
04:32:18,763 --> 04:32:20,204
pick up some other time.

2915
04:32:23,265 --> 04:32:36,430
Well, I think the problem is if we have a, I would say September 16th for continuing it for the moment because otherwise we're not going to host a meeting the following week, I don't think, and then that pushes it two weeks further out.

2916
04:32:36,450 --> 04:32:39,872
So I would say let's do our best.

2917
04:32:39,892 --> 04:32:46,995
I agree this is an issue we need to try to tackle and maybe just start scheduling twice monthly meetings.

2918
04:32:51,200 --> 04:32:54,882
So we're still two hours less than the last one.

2919
04:32:55,302 --> 04:32:55,542
Yeah.

2920
04:32:55,582 --> 04:32:55,982
No kidding.

2921
04:32:56,022 --> 04:32:59,464
Well, let's, we're getting closer.

2922
04:32:59,524 --> 04:33:00,305
So let's wrap it up.

2923
04:33:02,626 --> 04:33:10,530
So, um, is everybody okay for at least for the time being for September 16th and then we'll take it from there.

2924
04:33:10,910 --> 04:33:11,170
Okay.

2925
04:33:11,190 --> 04:33:11,370
Yep.

2926
04:33:12,431 --> 04:33:12,691
All right.

2927
04:33:12,851 --> 04:33:15,752
So, uh, who was it that made the motion?

2928
04:33:15,772 --> 04:33:17,293
Was that class?

2929
04:33:17,794 --> 04:33:18,554
Did you make the motion?

2930
04:33:20,087 --> 04:33:23,470
And can I just say something else, and I know I'm killing you guys.

2931
04:33:23,490 --> 04:33:23,870
Is it brief?

2932
04:33:24,110 --> 04:33:24,931
Yeah, it's really brief.

2933
04:33:25,412 --> 04:33:26,152
I just wanted to tell Ms.

2934
04:33:26,172 --> 04:33:32,938
Desmond that I absolutely am for this project, and I think it's a great project, and it's so important to the city.

2935
04:33:33,498 --> 04:33:37,682
And thank you for doing this, and thank you to the architect and the engineers for being here.

2936
04:33:39,433 --> 04:33:45,194
You heard the other things I had to say, but I just wanted to add that to my comments because it's important to say.

2937
04:33:45,614 --> 04:33:51,015
And I didn't mean to be argumentative, or I'm not against coming back with it.

2938
04:33:51,095 --> 04:33:52,435
I just want some directions.

2939
04:33:52,815 --> 04:33:53,876
Yep, that's good.

2940
04:33:53,996 --> 04:33:59,297
So I make a motion to continue to September 16th.

2941
04:34:00,057 --> 04:34:00,937
Yes, thank you.

2942
04:34:01,137 --> 04:34:01,957
And there was a second.

2943
04:34:02,037 --> 04:34:02,977
Who was the second?

2944
04:34:02,997 --> 04:34:04,117
Christy Dowd, I second.

2945
04:34:04,137 --> 04:34:05,478
Christy, thank you, Christy.

2946
04:34:05,638 --> 04:34:07,298
OK, roll call, Deanna Beabody.

2947
04:34:08,988 --> 04:34:09,708
Class Andreessen?

2948
04:34:10,288 --> 04:34:11,949
Aye.

2949
04:34:11,989 --> 04:34:12,649
David Blumberg?

2950
04:34:13,309 --> 04:34:13,469
Aye.

2951
04:34:14,589 --> 04:34:15,409
Jackie Furtado?

2952
04:34:16,010 --> 04:34:16,150
Aye.

2953
04:34:16,750 --> 04:34:17,370
Christy Dowd?

2954
04:34:18,050 --> 04:34:18,190
Aye.

2955
04:34:18,210 --> 04:34:19,450
Carmen, aye as well.

2956
04:34:19,470 --> 04:34:20,210
6-0.

2957
04:34:20,450 --> 04:34:23,471
Motion to continue passes unanimously.

2958
04:34:23,491 --> 04:34:28,192
Thank you very much, and we look forward to seeing you next month.

2959
04:34:30,613 --> 04:34:34,313
Is there, Annie, correct me if I'm wrong.

2960
04:34:34,333 --> 04:34:36,954
I don't think there's anything else we need to do at this time, right?

2961
04:34:38,697 --> 04:34:38,977
Good.

2962
04:34:39,417 --> 04:34:39,697
OK.

2963
04:34:40,198 --> 04:34:41,678
Is there a motion to adjourn?

2964
04:34:44,259 --> 04:34:44,999
I'll do the motion.

2965
04:34:45,240 --> 04:34:46,260
Motion to adjourn.

2966
04:34:46,420 --> 04:34:47,060
Thanks, Jackie.

2967
04:34:47,120 --> 04:34:47,420
Second?

2968
04:34:48,081 --> 04:34:48,421
Second.

2969
04:34:48,861 --> 04:34:49,141
Cles.

2970
04:34:49,801 --> 04:34:50,642
All right, roll call.

2971
04:34:50,662 --> 04:34:51,242
Deanna Peabody.

2972
04:34:51,842 --> 04:34:53,243
Aye.

2973
04:34:53,283 --> 04:34:54,023
Cles Andresen.

2974
04:34:54,703 --> 04:34:56,584
Aye.

2975
04:34:56,724 --> 04:34:57,504
Jackie Portado.

2976
04:34:57,984 --> 04:34:58,165
Aye.

2977
04:35:00,425 --> 04:35:01,046
Christy Dowd.

2978
04:35:01,706 --> 04:35:01,846
Aye.

2979
04:35:02,946 --> 04:35:03,667
David Bloomberg.

2980
04:35:04,347 --> 04:35:04,427
Aye.

2981
04:35:05,036 --> 04:35:06,657
Now, Tim, you were waving to me.

2982
04:35:06,677 --> 04:35:09,119
Are you saying bye, or is there something you were going to say?

2983
04:35:09,139 --> 04:35:10,300
OK, bye.

2984
04:35:10,720 --> 04:35:11,200
Thank you.

2985
04:35:11,320 --> 04:35:13,122
I was like, what do you want to say?

2986
04:35:13,142 --> 04:35:14,963
He'd say bye.

2987
04:35:17,445 --> 04:35:17,725
All right.

2988
04:35:17,765 --> 04:35:18,566
Thank you, everybody.

2989
04:35:18,586 --> 04:35:19,266
Thank you.

2990
04:35:19,286 --> 04:35:20,047
Have a good night.

2991
04:35:20,587 --> 04:35:21,067
Thank you.

2992
04:35:21,328 --> 04:35:21,848
Take care.
